Having some faith in the theory that the verdict of\r\nforeigners is equivalent to that of contemporary posterity, I have\r\nincluded two aliens in the group. A visitor to our shores, whether he\r\nbe a German princeling like Pückler-Muskau, or a gilded democrat like\r\nN. P. Willis, may be expected to observe and comment upon many traits\r\nof national life and manners that would escape the notice of a native\r\nchronicler.\r\n\r\nWhereas certain readers of a former volume--'Little Memoirs of the\r\nEighteenth Century'--seem to have been distressed by the fact that the\r\nmajority of the characters died in the nineteenth century, it is\r\nperhaps meet that I should apologise for the chronology of this\r\npresent volume, in which all the heroes and heroines, save one, were\r\nborn in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. But I would\r\nventure to submit that a man is not, necessarily, the child of the\r\ncentury in which he is born, or of that in which he dies; rather is he\r\nthe child of the century which sees the finest flower of his\r\nachievement._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON,\r\n\r\nLADY MORGAN (SYDNEY OWENSON)\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS\r\n\r\nLADY HESTER STANHOPE\r\n\r\nPRINCE PÜCKLER-MUSKAU IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AND MARY HOWITT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON,\r\n\r\nLADY MORGAN\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS\r\n\r\nLADY HESTER STANHOPE ON HORSEBACK\r\n\r\nLADY HESTER STANHOPE IN EASTERN COSTUME\r\n\r\nPRINCE PÜCKLER-MUSKAU\r\n\r\nMARY HOWITT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the most important ingredient in the composition of\r\nthe self-biographer is a spirit of childlike vanity, with a blend of\r\nunconscious egoism, few men have ever been better equipped than Haydon\r\nfor the production of a successful autobiography. In naïve simplicity\r\nof temperament he has only been surpassed by Pepys, in fulness\r\nof self-revelation by Rousseau, and his _Memoirs_ are not\r\nunworthy of a place in the same category as the _Diary_ and the\r\n_Confessions_. From the larger public, the work has hardly\r\nattracted the attention it deserves; it is too long, too minute, too\r\nheavily weighted with technical details and statements of financial\r\nembarrassments, to be widely or permanently popular. But as a human\r\ndocument, and as the portrait of a temperament, its value can hardly\r\nbe overestimated; while as a tragedy it is none the less tragic\r\nbecause it contains elements of the grotesque. Haydon set out with the\r\nlaudable intention of writing the exact truth about himself and his\r\ncareer, holding that every man who has suffered for a principle, and\r\nwho has been unjustly persecuted and oppressed, should write his own\r\nhistory, and set his own case before his countrymen. It is a fortunate\r\naccident for his readers that he should have been gifted with the\r\nfaculty of picturesque expression and an exceptionally keen power of\r\nobservation. If not a scholar, he was a man of wide reading, of deep\r\nthough desultory thinking, and a good critic where the work of others\r\nwas concerned. He seems to have desired to conceal nothing, nor to set\r\ndown aught in malice; if he fell into mistakes and misrepresentations,\r\nthese were the result of unconscious prejudice, and the exaggerative\r\ntendency of a brain that, if not actually warped, trembled on the\r\nborder-line of sanity. He hoped that his mistakes would be a warning\r\nto others, his successes a stimulus, and that the faithful record of\r\nhis struggles and aspirations would clear his memory from the\r\naspersions that his enemies had cast upon it.\r\n\r\nHaydon was born at Plymouth on January 26, 1786. He was the lineal\r\ndescendant of an ancient Devonshire family, the Haydons of Cadbay, who\r\nhad been ruined by a Chancery suit a couple of generations earlier,\r\nand had consequently taken a step downwards in the social scale. His\r\ngrandfather, who married Mary Baskerville, a descendant of the famous\r\nprinter, set up as a bookseller in Plymouth, and, dying in 1773,\r\nbequeathed his business to his son Benjamin, the father of our hero.\r\nThis Benjamin, who married the daughter of a Devonshire clergyman\r\nnamed Cobley, was a man of the old-fashioned, John Bull type, who\r\nloved his Church and king, believed that England was the only great\r\ncountry in the world, swore that Napoleon won all his battles by\r\nbribery, and would have knocked down any man who dared to disagree\r\nwith him. The childhood of the future historical painter was a\r\npicturesque and stirring period, filled with the echoes of revolution\r\nand the rumours of wars. The Sound was crowded with fighting ships\r\npreparing for sea, or returning battered and blackened, with wounded\r\nsoldiers on board and captured vessels in tow. Plymouth itself was\r\nfull of French prisoners, who made little models of guillotines out of\r\ntheir meat-bones, and sold them to the children for the then\r\nfashionable amusement of 'cutting off Louis XVI.'s head.'\r\n\r\nBenjamin was sent to the local grammar-school, whose headmaster, Dr.\r\nBidlake, was a man of some culture, though not a deep classic. He\r\nwrote poetry, encouraged his pupils to draw, and took them for country\r\nexcursions, with a view to fostering their love of nature. Mr. Haydon,\r\nthough he was proud of Benjamin's early attempts at drawing, had no\r\ndesire that he should be turned into an artist, and becoming alarmed\r\nat Dr. Bidlake's dilettante methods, he transferred his son to the\r\nPlympton Grammar-school, where Sir Joshua Reynolds had been educated,\r\nwith strict injunctions to the headmaster that the boy was on no\r\naccount to have drawing-lessons. On leaving school at sixteen,\r\nBenjamin, after, a few months with a firm of accountants at Exeter,\r\nwas bound apprentice to his father for seven years, and it was then\r\nthat his troubles began.\r\n\r\n'I hated day-books, ledgers, bill-books, and cashbooks,' he tells us.\r\n'I hated standing behind the counter, and insulted the customers; I\r\nhated the town and all the people in it.' At last, after a quarrel\r\nwith a customer who tried to drive a bargain, this proud spirit\r\nrefused to enter the shop again. In vain his father pointed out to him\r\nthe folly of letting a good business go to ruin, of refusing a\r\ncomfortable independence--all argument was vain. An illness, which\r\nresulted in inflammation of the eyes, put a stop to the controversy\r\nfor the time being; but on recovery, with his sight permanently\r\ninjured, the boy still refused to work out his articles, but wandered\r\nabout the town in search of casts and books on art. He bought a fine\r\ncopy of Albinus at his father's expense, and in a fortnight, with his\r\nsister to aid, learnt all the muscles of the body, their rise and\r\ninsertion, by heart. He stumbled accidentally on Reynold's\r\n_Discourses_, and the first that he read placed so much reliance\r\non honest industry, and expressed so strong a conviction that all men\r\nare equal in talent, and that application makes all the difference,\r\nthat the would-be artist, who hitherto had been held back by some\r\ndistrust of his natural powers, felt that at last his destiny was\r\nirrevocably fixed. He announced his intention of adopting an\r\nart-career with a determination that demolished all argument, and, in\r\nspite of remonstrances, reproaches, tears, and scoldings, he wrung\r\nfrom his father permission to go to London, and the promise of support\r\nfor the next two years.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1804, at the age of eighteen, young Haydon took his place\r\nin the mail, and made his first flight into the world. Arriving at the\r\nlodgings that had been taken for him in the Strand in the early\r\nmorning, he had no sooner breakfasted than he set off for Somerset\r\nHouse, to see the Royal Academy Exhibition. Looking round for\r\nhistorical pictures, he discovered that Opie's 'Gil Bias' was the\r\ncentre of attraction in one room, and Westall's 'Shipwrecked Boy' in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n'I don't fear you,' he said to himself as he strode away. His next\r\nstep was to inquire for a plaster-shop, where he bought the Laocoön\r\nand other casts, and then, having unpacked his Albinus, he was hard at\r\nwork before nine next morning drawing from the round, and breathing\r\naspirations for High Art, and defiance to all opposition. 'For three\r\nmonths,' he tells us, 'I saw nothing but my books, my casts, and my\r\ndrawings. My enthusiasm was immense, my devotion for study that of a\r\nmartyr. I rose when I woke, at three or four, drew at anatomy till\r\neight, in chalks from casts from nine till one, and from half-past two\r\ntill five--then walked, dined, and to anatomy again from seven till\r\nten or eleven. I was resolute to be a great painter, to honour my\r\ncountry, and to rescue the Art from that stigma of incapacity that was\r\nimpressed upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter some months of solitary study, Haydon bethought him of a letter\r\nof introduction that had been given him to Prince Hoare, who was\r\nsomething of a critic, having himself failed as an artist. Hoare\r\ngood-naturedly encouraged the youth in his ambitions, and gave him\r\nintroductions to Northcote, Opie, and Fuseli.\r\n\r\nTo Northcote, who was a Plymouth man, Haydon went first, and he gives\r\na curious account of his interview with his distinguished\r\nfellow-countryman, who also had once cherished aspirations after high\r\nart. Northcote, a little wizened old man, with a broad Devonshire\r\naccent, exclaimed on hearing that his young visitor intended to be a\r\nhistorical painter: 'Heestorical painter! why, ye'll starve with a\r\nbundle of straw under yeer head.' As for anatomy, he declared that it\r\nwas no use. 'Sir Joshua didn't know it; why should you want to know\r\nwhat he didn't? Michael Angelo! What's he to do here? You must paint\r\nportraits here.' 'I won't,' said young Haydon, clenching his teeth,\r\nand he marched off to Opie. He found a coarse-looking, intellectual\r\nman who, after reading the introductory letter, said quietly, 'You are\r\nstudying anatomy--master it--were I your age, I would do the same.'\r\nThe last visit was to Fuseli, who had a great reputation for the\r\nterrible, both as artist and as man. The gallery into which the\r\nvisitor was ushered was so full of devils, witches, ghosts, blood and\r\nthunder, that it was a palpable relief when nothing more alarming\r\nappeared than a little old and lion-faced man, attired in a flannel\r\ndressing-gown, with the bottom of Mrs. Fuseli's work-basket on his\r\nhead! Fuseli, who had just been appointed Keeper of Academy, received\r\nthe young man kindly, praised his drawings, and expressed a hope that\r\nhe would see him at the Academy School.\r\n\r\nAfter the Christmas vacation of 1805, Haydon began to attend the\r\nAcademy classes, where he struck up a close friendship with John\r\nJackson, afterwards a popular portrait-painter and Royal Academician,\r\nbut then a student like himself. Jackson was the son of a village\r\ntailor in Yorkshire, and the _protége_ of Lord Mulgrave and Sir\r\nGeorge Beaumont. The two friends told each other their plans for the\r\nfuture, drew together in the evenings, and made their first\r\nlife-studies from a friendly coalheaver whom they persuaded to sit to\r\nthem. After a few months of hard work, Haydon was summoned home to\r\ntake leave of his father, who was believed to be dying. The invalid\r\nrecovered, and then followed another period of torture for the young\r\nstudent--aunts, uncles, and cousins all trying to drive the stray\r\nsheep back into the commercial fold. Exhausted by the struggle, Haydon\r\nat last consented to relinquish his career, and enter the business.\r\nGreat was his delight and surprise when his father refused to accept\r\nthe sacrifice--which was made in anything but a cheerful spirit--and\r\npromised to contribute to his support until he was able to provide for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these domestic convulsions came a letter from\r\nJackson, containing the announcement that there was 'a raw, tall,\r\npale, queer Scotchman just come up, an odd fellow, but with something\r\nin him. He is called Wilkie.' 'Hang the fellow!' said Haydon to\r\nhimself. 'I hope with his \"something\" he is not going to be a\r\nhistorical painter.' On his return to town, our hero made the\r\nacquaintance of the queer young Scotchman, and was soon admitted to\r\nhis friendship and intimacy. Wilkie's 'Village Politicians' was the\r\nsensation of the Exhibition of 1806, and brought him two important\r\ncommissions--one from Lord Mulgrave for the 'Blind Fiddler,' and the\r\nother from Sir George Beaumont for the 'Rent-Day.' It was now\r\nconsidered that Wilkie's fortune was made, his fame secure, and if his\r\ntwo chief friends--Haydon and Jackson--could not help regarding him\r\nwith some natural feelings of envy, it is evident that his early\r\nsuccess encouraged them, and stimulated them to increased effort.\r\n\r\nHaydon had been learning fresh secrets in his art, partly from an\r\nanatomical 'subject' that he had obtained from a surgeon, and partly\r\nfrom his introduction, through the good offices of Jackson, to the\r\nworks of Titian at Stafford House, and in other private collections,\r\nthere being as yet no National Gallery where the student could study\r\nthe old masters at his pleasure. Haydon was now panting to begin his\r\nfirst picture, his natural self-confidence having been strengthened by\r\na letter from Wilkie, who reported that Lord Mulgrave, with whom he\r\nwas staying, was much interested in what he had heard of Haydon's\r\nambitions. Lord Mulgrave had suggested a heroic subject--the Death of\r\nDentatus--which he would like to see painted, and he wished to know if\r\nthis commended itself to Haydon's ideas. This first commission for a\r\ngreat historical picture--for so he understood the suggestion--was a\r\ntriumph for the young artist, who felt himself gloriously rewarded for\r\ntwo years of labour and opposition. He had, however, already decided\r\non the subject of his first attempt--Joseph and Mary resting on the\r\nroad to Egypt. On October 1,1806, after setting his palette, and\r\ntaking his brush in hand, he knelt down, in accordance with his\r\ninvariable custom throughout his career, and prayed fervently that God\r\nwould bless his work, grant him energy to create a new era in art, and\r\nrouse the people to a just estimate of the moral value of historical\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nThen followed a happy time. The difficulties of a first attempt were\r\nincreased by his lack of systematic training, but Haydon believed,\r\nwith Sir Joshua, that application made the artist, and he certainly\r\nspared no pains to achieve success. He painted and repainted his heads\r\na dozen times, and used to mix tints on a piece of paper, and carry\r\nthem down to Stafford House once a week in order to compare them with\r\nthe colouring of the Titians. While this work was in progress, Sir\r\nGeorge and Lady Beaumont called to see the picture, which they\r\ndeclared was very poetical, and 'quite large enough for anything' (the\r\ncanvas was six feet by four), and invited the artist to dinner. This\r\nfirst dinner-party, in what he regarded as 'high life,' was an\r\nalarming ordeal for the country youth, who made prodigious\r\npreparations, drove to the house in a state of abject terror, and in\r\nfive minutes was sitting on an ottoman, talking to Lady Beaumont, and\r\nmore at ease than he had ever been in his life. In truth, bashfulness\r\nwas never one of Haydon's foibles.\r\n\r\nThe Joseph and Mary took six months to paint, and was exhibited in\r\n1807. It was considered a remarkable work for a young student, and was\r\nbought the following year by Mr. Hope of Deepdene. During the season,\r\nHaydon was introduced to Lord Mulgrave, and with his friends Wilkie\r\nand Jackson frequently dined at the Admiralty, [Footnote: Lord\r\nMulgrave had recently been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty.]\r\nwhere they met ministers, generals, great ladies and men of genius,\r\nand rose daily in hope and promise. Haydon now began the picture of\r\nthe 'Death of Siccius Dentatus' that his patron had suggested, but he\r\nfound the difficulties so overwhelming that, by Wilkie's advice, he\r\ndecided to go down to Plymouth for a few months, and practise\r\nportrait-painting. At fifteen guineas a head, he got plenty of\r\nemployment among his friends and relations, though he owns that his\r\nportraits were execrable; but as soon as he had obtained some facility\r\nin painting heads, he was anxious to return to town to finish his\r\nlarge picture. Mrs. Haydon was now in declining health, and desiring\r\nto consult a famous surgeon in London, she decided to travel thither\r\nwith her son and daughter. Unfortunately her disease, angina pectoris,\r\nwas aggravated by the agitation of the journey, and on the road, at\r\nSalt Hill, she was seized with an attack that proved fatal. Haydon was\r\nobliged to return to Devonshire with his sister, but as soon as the\r\nfuneral was over he set off again for town, where his prospects seemed\r\nto justify his exchanging his garret in the Strand for a first floor\r\nin Great Marlborough Street.\r\n\r\nHe found the practice gained in portrait-painting a substantial\r\nadvantage, but he still felt himself incapable of composing a heroic\r\nfigure for Dentatus. 'If I copied nature my work was mean,' he\r\ncomplains; 'and if I left her it was mannered. How was I to build a\r\nheroic form like life, yet above life?' He was puzzled to find, in\r\npainting from the living model, that the markings of the skin varied\r\nwith the action of the limbs, variations that did not appear in the\r\nfew specimens of the antique that had come under his notice. Was\r\nnature wrong, he asked himself, or the antique? During this period of\r\nindecision and confusion came a proposal from Wilkie that they should\r\ngo together to inspect the Elgin Marbles then newly arrived in\r\nEngland, and deposited at Lord Elgin's house in Park Lane. Haydon\r\ncarelessly agreed, knowing nothing of the wonders he was to see, and\r\nthe two friends proceeded to Park Lane, where they were ushered\r\nthrough a yard to a dirty shed, in which lay the world-famous Marbles.\r\n\r\n'The first thing I fixed my eyes on,' to quote Haydon's own words,\r\n'was the wrist of a figure in one of the female groups, in which were\r\nvisible the radius and ulna. I was astonished, for I had never seen\r\nthem hinted at in any wrist in the antique. I darted my eye to the\r\nelbow, and saw the outer condyle visibly affecting the shape, as in\r\nnature. That combination of nature and repose which I had felt was so\r\nmuch wanting for high art was here displayed to midday conviction. My\r\nheart beat. If I had seen nothing else, I had beheld sufficient to\r\nhelp me to nature for the rest of my life. But when I turned to the\r\nTheseus, and saw that every form was altered by action or repose-when\r\nI saw that the two sides of his back varied as he rested on his elbow;\r\nand again, when in the figure of the fighting metope, I saw the muscle\r\nshown under one armpit in that instantaneous action of darting out,\r\nand left out in the other armpits; when I saw, in short, the most\r\nheroic style of art, combined with all the essential detail of\r\neveryday life, the thing was done at once and for ever.... Here were\r\nthe principles which the great Greeks in their finest time\r\nestablished, and here was I, the most prominent historical student,\r\nperfectly qualified to appreciate all this by my own determined mode\r\nof study.'\r\n\r\nOn returning to his painting-room, Haydon, feeling utterly disgusted\r\nwith his attempt at the heroic in the form and action of Dentatus,\r\nobliterated what he calls 'the abominable mass,' and breathed as if\r\nrelieved of a nuisance. Through Lord Mulgrave he obtained an order to\r\ndraw from the Marbles, and devoted the next three months to mastering\r\ntheir secrets, and bringing his hand and mind into subjection to the\r\nprinciples that they displayed. 'I rose with the sun,' he writes, with\r\nthe glow of his first enthusiasm still upon him, 'and opened my eyes\r\nto the light only to be conscious of my high pursuit. I sprang from my\r\nbed, dressed like one possessed, and passed the day, noon, and the\r\nnight, in the same dream of abstracted enthusiasm; secluded from the\r\nworld, regardless of its feelings, impregnable to disease, insensible\r\nto contempt.' He painted his heads, figures, and draperies over and\r\nover again, feeling that to obliterate was the only way to improve.\r\nHis studio soon filled with fashionable folk, who came to see the\r\n'extraordinary picture painted by a young man who had never had the\r\nadvantages of foreign travel.' Haydon believed, with the simplicity of\r\na child, in all these flattering prophecies of glory and fame, and\r\nimagined that the Academy would welcome with open arms so promising a\r\nstudent, one, moreover, who had been trained in its own school. He\r\nredoubled his efforts, and in March 1809, 'Dentatus' was finished.\r\n\r\n'The production of this picture,' he naively explains, 'must and will\r\nbe considered as an epoch in English art. The drawing in it was\r\ncorrect and elevated, and the perfect forms and system of the antique\r\nwere carried into painting, united with the fleshy look of everyday\r\nlife. The colour, light and shadow, the composition and the telling of\r\nthe story were complete.' His contemporaries did not form quite so\r\nflattering an estimate of the work. It was badly hung, a fate to which\r\nmany an artist of three-and-twenty has had to submit, before and\r\nsince; but Haydon writes as if no such injustice had been committed\r\nsince the world began, and was persuaded that the whole body of\r\nAcademicians was leagued in spite and jealousy against him. Lord\r\nMulgrave gave him sixty guineas in addition to the hundred he had\r\nfirst promised, which seems a fair price for the second work of an\r\nobscure artist, but poor Haydon fancied that his professional\r\nprospects had suffered from the treatment of the Academy, that people\r\nof fashion (on whose attentions he set great store) were neglecting\r\nhim, and that he was a marked man. A sea-trip to Plymouth with Wilkie\r\ngave his thoughts a new and more healthy turn. Together, the friends\r\nvisited Sir Joshua's birthplace, and roamed over the moors and combes\r\nof Devonshire. Before returning to town, they spent a delightful\r\nfortnight with Sir George Beaumont at Coleorton, where, says Haydon,\r\n'we dined with the Claude and Rembrandt before us, and breakfasted\r\nwith the Rubens landscape, and did nothing, morning, noon, and night,\r\nbut think of painting, talk of painting, and wake to paint again.'\r\n\r\nDuring this visit, Sir George gave Haydon a commission for a picture\r\non a subject from _Macbeth_. After it was begun, he objected to\r\nthe size, but our artist, who, throughout his life, detested painting\r\ncabinet pictures, refused to attempt anything on a smaller scale. He\r\npersuaded Sir George to withhold his decision until the picture was\r\nfinished, and promised that if he still objected to the size, he would\r\npaint him another on any scale he pleased. While engaged on 'Macbeth,'\r\nhe competed with 'Dentatus' for a hundred guinea prize offered by the\r\nDirectors of the British Gallery for the best historical picture.\r\n'Dentatus' won the prize, but this piece of good fortune was\r\ncounterbalanced by a letter from Mr. Haydon, senior, containing the\r\nannouncement that he could no longer afford to maintain his son. This\r\nwas a heavy blow, but after turning over pros and cons in his own\r\nmind, Haydon came to the conclusion that since he had won the hundred\r\nguinea prize, he had a good chance of winning a three hundred guinea\r\nprize, which the Directors now offered, with his 'Macbeth,' and\r\nconsequently that he had no occasion to dread starvation. 'Thus\r\nreasoning,' he says, 'I borrowed, and praying God to bless my\r\nemotions, went on more vigorously than ever. _And here began debt\r\nand obligation, out of which I have never been, and shall never be,\r\nextricated, as long as I live.'_\r\n\r\nThis prophecy proved only too true. But Haydon, though he afterwards\r\nbitterly regretted his folly in exchanging independence for debt, and\r\nhis pride in refusing to paint pot-boilers in the intervals of his\r\ngreat works, firmly believed that he, with his high aims and fervent\r\ndesire to serve the cause of art, was justified in continuing his\r\nambitious course, and depending for maintenance on the contributions\r\nof his friends. Nothing could exceed the approbation of his own\r\nconduct, or shake his faith in his own powers. 'I was a virtuous and\r\ndiligent youth,' he assures us; 'I never touched wine, dined at\r\nreasonable chop-houses, lived principally in my study, and cleaned my\r\nown brushes, like the humblest student.' He goes to see Sebastian del\r\nPiombo's 'Lazarus' in the Angerstein collection, and, after writing a\r\ncareful criticism of the work, concludes: 'It is a grand picture; a\r\ngreat acquisition to the country, and an honour to Mr. Angerstein's\r\ntaste and spirit in buying it; yet if God cut not my life permanently\r\nshort, I hope I shall leave one behind me that will do more honour to\r\nmy country than this has done to Rome. In short, if I live, I will--I\r\nfeel I shall, (God pardon me if this is presumption. June 31, 1810.)'\r\n\r\nAt this time Haydon devoted a good deal of his leisure to reading\r\nclassic authors, Homer, Æschylus, and Virgil, in order to tune his\r\nmind to high thoughts. Nearly every day he spent a few hours in\r\ndrawing from the Elgin Marbles, and he piously thanks God that he was\r\nin existence on their arrival. He spared no pains to ensure that his\r\n'Macbeth' should be perfect in poetry, expression, form and colour,\r\nmaking casts and studies without end. His friends related, as a\r\nwonderful specimen of his conscientiousness, that, after having\r\ncompleted the figure of Macbeth, he took it out in order to raise it\r\nhigher in the picture, believing that this would improve the effect.\r\n'The wonder in ancient Athens would have been if I had suffered him to\r\nremain,' he observes. 'Such is the state of art in this country!'\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Haydon entered into his first journalistic controversy, an\r\nunfortunate departure, as it turned out, since it gave him a taste for\r\nairing his ideas in print. Leigh Hunt, to whom he had been introduced\r\na year or two before, had attacked one of his theories, relative to a\r\nstandard figure, in the _Examiner_. Haydon replied, was replied\r\nto himself, and thoroughly enjoyed the controversy which, he says,\r\nconsolidated his powers of verbal expression. Leigh Hunt he describes\r\nas a fine specimen of a London editor, with his bushy hair, black\r\neyes, pale face, and 'nose of taste.' He was assuming yet moderate,\r\nsarcastic yet genial, with a smattering of everything and mastery of\r\nnothing; affecting the dictator, the poet, the politician, the critic,\r\nand the sceptic, whichever would, at the moment, give him the air, to\r\ninferior minds, of a very superior man.' Although Haydon disliked\r\nHunt's 'Cockney peculiarities,' and disapproved of his republican\r\nprinciples, yet the fearless honesty of his opinions, the unhesitating\r\nsacrifice of his own interests, the unselfish perseverance of his\r\nattacks upon all abuses, whether royal or religious, noble or\r\ndemocratic, made a deep impression on the young artist's mind.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1811 the new picture, which represents Macbeth\r\nstepping between the sleeping grooms to murder the king, was finished,\r\nand sent to the British Gallery. It was well hung, and was praised by\r\nthe critics, but Sir George declined to take it, though he offered to\r\npay Haydon a hundred pounds for his trouble, or to give him a\r\ncommission for a picture on a smaller scale. Haydon petulantly refused\r\nboth offers, and thus after three years' work, and incurring debts to\r\nthe amount of six hundred pounds, he found himself penniless, with his\r\npicture returned on his hands. This disappointment was only the\r\nnatural result of his own impracticable temperament, but to Haydon's\r\nexaggerative sense the whole world seemed joined in a conspiracy\r\nagainst him. 'Exasperated by the neglect of my family,' he writes,\r\n'tormented by the consciousness of debt, cut to the heart by the\r\ncruelty of Sir George, and enraged at the insults of the Academy, I\r\nbecame furious.' His fury, unfortunately, found vent in an attack upon\r\nthe Academy and its methods, through the medium of the _Examiner_,\r\nwhich was the recognised vehicle of all attacks upon authority.\r\nThe onslaught seems to have been justified, though whether\r\nit was judicious is another question. The ideals of English artists\r\nduring the early years of the nineteenth century had sunk very low,\r\nand the standard of public taste was several degrees lower.\r\nPortrait-painting was the only lucrative branch of art, and the\r\nAcademy was almost entirely in the hands of the portrait-painters, who\r\ngave little encouragement to works of imagination. The burden of the\r\npatron, which had been removed from literature, still rested upon\r\npainting, and the Academicians found it more to their interest to\r\nfoster the ignorance than to educate the taste of the patron.\r\n\r\nOver the signature of 'An English Student,' Haydon not only exposed\r\nthe inefficiency of the Academy, but advocated numerous reforms, chief\r\namong them being an improved method of election, the establishment of\r\nschools of design, a reduction in the power of the Council, and an\r\nannual grant of public money for purposes of art. In these days, when\r\nthe Academicians are no longer regarded as a sacred body, it is hard\r\nto realise the commotion that these letters made in art circles,\r\nwhether professional or amateur. The identity of the 'English Student'\r\nwas soon discovered, and 'from that moment,' writes Haydon, 'the\r\ndestiny of my life was changed. My picture was caricatured, my name\r\ndetested, my peace harassed. I was looked at like a monster, abused\r\nlike a plague, and avoided like a maniac.' There is probably some\r\ncharacteristic exaggeration in this statement, but considering the\r\npower wielded at this time by the Academy and its supporters, Haydon\r\nwould undoubtedly have done better, from a worldly point of view, to\r\nkeep clear of these controversies. The prudent and sensible Wilkie was\r\nmuch distressed at his friend's ebullition of temper, and earnestly\r\nadvised him to follow up the reputation his brush had gained for him,\r\nand leave the pen alone. 'In moments of depression,' wrote Haydon,\r\nmany years later, 'I often wished I had followed Wilkie's advice, but\r\nthen I should never have acquired that grand and isolated reputation,\r\nsolitary and unsupported, which, while it encumbers the individual,\r\ninspires him with vigour proportioned to the load.'\r\n\r\nOn April 3, 1812, Haydon records in his journal: 'My canvas came home\r\nfor Solomon, twelve feet ten inches by ten feet ten inches--a grand\r\nsize. God in heaven, grant me strength of body and vigour of mind to\r\ncover it with excellence. Amen--on my knees.' His design was to paint\r\na series of great ideal works, that should stand comparison with the\r\nproductions of the old masters, and he had chosen the somewhat\r\nstereotyped subject of the Judgment of Solomon, because Raphael and\r\nRubens had both tried it, and he intended to tell the story better! He\r\nwas now, at the beginning of this ambitious project, entirely without\r\nmeans. His father had died, and left him nothing, and his 'Macbeth'\r\nhad not won the £300 premium at the British Gallery. His aristocratic\r\nfriends had temporarily deserted him, but the Hunts assisted him with\r\nthe ready liberality of the impecunious. John lent him small sums of\r\nmoney, while Leigh offered him a plate at his table till Solomon was\r\nfinished, and initiated him into the mysteries of drawing and\r\ndiscounting bills.\r\n\r\nHaydon already owed his landlord two hundred pounds, but that seemed\r\nto him no reason for moving into cheaper rooms. He called the man up,\r\nand represented to him that he was about to paint a great masterpiece,\r\nwhich would take him two years, during which period he would earn\r\nnothing, and be unable to pay any rent. The landlord, surely a unique\r\nspecimen of his order, deliberated rather ruefully over the prospect\r\nset before him, rubbed his chin, and muttered: 'I should not like ye\r\nto go--it's hard for both of us; but what I say is, you always paid me\r\nwhen you could, and why should you not again when you are able?...\r\nWell, sir, here's my hand; I'll give you two years more, and if this\r\ndoes not sell--why then, sir, we'll consider what is to be done.'\r\n\r\nThus a roof was provided, but there was still dinner to be thought of,\r\nsince, if a man works, he must also eat. 'I went to the house [John o'\r\nGroat's] where I had always dined,' writes Haydon, 'intending to dine\r\nwithout paying for that day. I thought the servants did not offer me\r\nthe same attention. I thought I perceived the company examine me--I\r\nthought the meat was worse. My heart sank, as I said falteringly, \"I\r\nwill pay you to-morrow.\" The girl smiled, and seemed interested. As I\r\nwas escaping with a sort of lurking horror, she said, \"Mr. Haydon, my\r\nmaster wishes to see you.\" \"My God,\" thought I, \"it is to tell me he\r\ncan't trust!\" In I walked like a culprit. \"Sir, I beg your pardon, but\r\nI see by the papers you have been ill-used; I hope you won't be\r\nangry--I mean no offence; but I just wish to say, as you have dined\r\nhere many years and always paid, if it would be a convenience during\r\nyour present work to dine here till it is done--so that you may not be\r\nobliged to spend your money here when you may want it--I was going to\r\nsay that you need be under no apprehension--hem! for a dinner.\"' This\r\nhandsome offer was condescendingly accepted, and the good man seemed\r\nquite relieved.\r\n\r\nWhile Solomon was slowly progressing at the expense of the landlord\r\nand the eating-house keeper, Haydon spent his leisure in literary\r\nrather than artistic circles. At Leigh Hunt's he met, and became\r\nintimate with Charles Lamb, Keats, Hazlitt, and John Scott. In January\r\n1813 he writes: 'Spent the evening with Leigh Hunt at West End. His\r\nsociety is always delightful. I do not know a purer, more virtuous\r\npartner, or a more witty and enlivening man. We talked of his\r\napproaching imprisonment. He said it would be a great pleasure if he\r\nwere certain to be sent to Newgate, because he should be in the midst\r\nof his friends.' Hazlitt won our hero's liking by praising his\r\n'Macbeth.' 'Thence began a friendship,' Haydon tells us, 'for that\r\ninteresting man, that singular mixture of friend and fiend, radical\r\nand critic, metaphysician, poet, and painter, on whose word no one\r\ncould rely, on whose heart no one could calculate, and some of whose\r\ndeductions he himself would try to explain in vain.... Mortified at\r\nhis own failure [in painting] he resolved that as he had not\r\nsucceeded, no one else should, and he spent the whole of his\r\nafter-life in damping the ardour, chilling the hopes, and dimming the\r\nprospects of patrons and painters, so that after I once admitted him,\r\nI had nothing but forebodings of failure to bear up against, croakings\r\nabout the climate, and sneers at the taste of the public.'\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1814 Solomon was approaching completion, but the\r\nartist had been reduced to living for a fortnight on potatoes. He had\r\nnow been nearly four years without a commission, and three without any\r\nhelp from home, so that it is not surprising to learn that he felt\r\ncompletely broken down in body and mind, or that his debts amounted to\r\n£1100. A frame was procured on credit, and, failing any more suitable\r\nplace of exhibition, the picture was sent to the Water-colour Society.\r\nAt the private view, the Princess of Wales and other eminent critics\r\npronounced against the Solomon, but as soon as the public were\r\nadmitted, the tune changed, and John Bull vowed it was the finest work\r\nof art ever produced in England. If posterity has not indorsed this\r\njudgment, the Solomon is at least regarded, by competent critics, as\r\nHaydon's most successful work. 'Before the doors had been open half an\r\nhour,' writes Haydon, 'a gentleman opened his pocket-book, and showed\r\nme a £500 note. \"Will you take it?\" My heart beat--my agonies of want\r\npressed, but it was too little. I trembled out, \"I cannot.\" The\r\ngentleman invited me to dine, and when we were sitting over our wine,\r\nagreed to give me my price. His lady said, \"But, my dear, where am I\r\nto put my piano?\" and the bargain was at an end!' On the third day Sir\r\nGeorge Beaumont and Mr. Holwell Carr came to the Exhibition, having\r\nbeen deputed to buy the picture for the British Gallery. While they\r\nwere discussing its merits, one of the officials went over, and put\r\n'sold' on the frame, whereupon the artist says he thought he should\r\nhave fainted. The work had been bought at the price asked, £700, by\r\ntwo Plymouth bankers, Sir William Elford (the friend and correspondent\r\nof Miss Mitford) and Mr. Tingecombe.\r\n\r\nPoor Haydon now thought that his fortune was secure. He paid away £500\r\nto landlord and tradesmen in the first week, and though this did not\r\nsettle half his debts, it restored his credit. The balance was spent\r\nin a trip to Paris with Wilkie, Paris being then (May 1814) the most\r\ninteresting place on earth. All the nations of Europe were gathered\r\ntogether there, and the Louvre was in its glory. So absorbed and\r\nfascinated was Haydon by the actual life of the city, that he finds\r\nlittle to say about the works of art there collected. Yet his first\r\nvisit was to the Louvre, and he describes with what impetuosity he\r\nbounded up the steps, three at a time, and how he scolded Wilkie for\r\ntrotting up with his usual deliberation. 'I might just as well have\r\nscolded the column,' he observes. 'I soon left him at some Jan Steen,\r\nwhile I never stopped until I stood before the \"Transfiguration.\" My\r\nfirst feeling was disappointment. It looked small, harsh and hard.\r\nThis, of course, is always the way when you have fed your imagination\r\nfor years on a work you know only by prints. Even the \"Pietro Martyre\"\r\nwas smaller than I thought to find it; yet after the difference\r\nbetween reality and anticipation had worn away, these great works\r\namply repaid the study of them, and grew up to the fancy, or rather\r\nthe fancy grew up to them.... It will hardly be believed by artists\r\nthat we often forgot the great works in the Louvre in the scenes\r\naround us, and found Russians and Bashkirs from Tartary more\r\nattractive than the \"Transfiguration\"; but so it was, and I do not\r\nthink we were very wrong either. Why stay poring over pictures when we\r\nwere on the most remarkable scene in the history of the earth.'\r\n\r\nOn his return to London, Haydon was gratified by the news that his\r\nfriend and fellow-townsman, George Eastlake, had proposed and carried\r\na motion that he should be presented with the freedom of his native\r\ncity, as a testimony of respect for his extraordinary merit as a\r\nhistorical painter. Furthermore, the Directors of the British Gallery\r\nsent him a hundred guineas as a token of their admiration for his\r\nlatest work. But no commission followed, either from a private patron\r\nor public body. However, the artist, nothing daunted, ordered a larger\r\ncanvas, and set vigorously to work on a representation of 'Christ's\r\nEntry into Jerusalem,' a picture which occupied him, with intervals of\r\nillness and idleness, for nearly six years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1815 was too full of stir and excitement for a man like\r\nHaydon, who was always keenly interested in public affairs, to devote\r\nhimself to steady work. The news of Waterloo almost turned his brain.\r\nOn June 23 he notes: 'I read the _Gazette_ [with the account of\r\nWaterloo] the last thing before going to bed. I dreamt of it, and was\r\nfighting all night; I got up in a steam of feeling, and read the\r\n_Gazette_ again, ordered a _Courier_ for a month, and read all\r\nthe papers till I was faint.... 'Have not the efforts of the\r\nnation,' I asked myself, 'been gigantic?' To such glories she only\r\nwants to add the glories of my noble art to make her the grandest\r\nnation in the world, and these she shall have if God spare my life....\r\n\r\n'_June_ 25.--Dined with Hunt. I give myself credit for not\r\nworrying him to death at this news. He was quiet for some time, but\r\nknowing it must come, and putting on an air of indifference, he said,\r\n\"Terrible battle this, Haydon.\" \"A glorious one, Hunt.\" \"Oh yes,\r\ncertainly,\" and to it we went. Yet Hunt took a just and liberal view\r\nof the situation. As for Hazlitt, it is not to be believed how the\r\ndestruction of Napoleon affected him; he seemed prostrated in mind and\r\nbody; he walked about unwashed, unshaved, hardly sober by day, and\r\nalways intoxicated by night, literally, without exaggeration, for\r\nweeks, until at length, wakening as it were from his stupor, he at\r\nonce left off all stimulating liquors, and never touched them after.'\r\n\r\nIt is in this year that we find the first mention in the Journal of\r\nWordsworth, who, throughout his life, was one of Haydon's most\r\nfaithful friends and appreciative admirers. On April 13, the artist\r\nrecords: 'I had a cast made yesterday of Wordsworth's face. He bore it\r\nlike a philosopher.... We afterwards called on Hunt, and as Hunt had\r\npreviously attacked him, and now has reformed his opinions, the\r\nmeeting was interesting. Hunt paid him the highest compliments, and\r\ntold him that as he grew wiser and got older, he found his respect for\r\nhis powers, and enthusiasm for his genius, increase.... I afterwards\r\nsauntered with him to Hampstead, with great delight. Never did any man\r\nso beguile the time as Wordsworth. His purity of heart, his kindness,\r\nhis soundness of principle, his information, his knowledge, and the\r\nintense and eager feelings with which he pours forth all he knows,\r\naffect, interest, and enchant one. I do not know any one I would be so\r\ninclined to worship as a purified being.'\r\n\r\nThe new picture was not far advanced before the painter was once again\r\nat the end of his resources, though not of his courage. Fifty guineas\r\nwere advanced to him by Sir George Beaumont, who had now commissioned\r\na picture at two hundred guineas, and Mr. (after Sir George) Phillips,\r\nof Manchester, gave him a commission of £500 for a sacred work, paying\r\none hundred guineas down. But these advances melted rapidly away in\r\nthe expenses attendant on the painting of so ambitious a work as the\r\n'Entry into Jerusalem.' Towards the close of the year Haydon's health\r\nbegan to suffer from his excessive application, his sight weakened,\r\nand he was often unable to paint for months at a time. Under these\r\nafflictions, he was consoled by receiving permission to take casts of\r\nthe Elgin Marbles, the authenticity of which treasures had recently\r\nbeen attacked by the art-critic, Knight Payne, who declared that they\r\nwere not Greek at all, but Roman, of the time of Hadrian. Such was the\r\neffect of Payne Knight's opinion that the Marbles went down in the\r\npublic estimation, the Government hesitated to buy them for the\r\nnation, and they were left neglected in a damp shed. Haydon was\r\nfurious at this insult to the objects of his idolatry, whose merits he\r\nhad been preaching in season and out of season since the day that he\r\nfirst set eyes upon the Theseus and the Ilissus. At this critical\r\nmoment he found himself supported by a new and powerful champion in\r\nthe person of Canova, who had just arrived in England. Canova at once\r\nadmitted that the style of the Marbles was superior to that of all\r\nother known marbles, and declared that they were well worth coming\r\nfrom Rome to see. 'Canova's visit was a victory for me,' writes\r\nHaydon, who had received the sculptor at his studio, and introduced\r\nhim to some of the artistic lions of London. 'What became now of all\r\nthe sneers at my senseless insanity about the Marbles? I, unknown,\r\nwith no station or rank, might have talked myself dumb; but for\r\nCanova, the great artist of Europe, to repeat word for word what I had\r\nbeen saying for seven years! His opinion could not be gainsaid.'\r\n\r\nIf our troubles are apt to come not in single file, but in 'whole\r\nbattalions,' our triumphs also occasionally arrive in squadrons, or\r\nsuch at least was Haydon's experience. Hard upon Canova's departure\r\ncame a letter from Wordsworth, enclosing three sonnets, the last of\r\nwhich had, he avowed, been inspired by a letter of Haydon's on the\r\nstruggles and hardships of the artist's life. This is now the familiar\r\nsonnet beginning, 'High is our calling, Friend,' and concluding:\r\n\r\n 'Great is the glory, for the strife is hard.'\r\n\r\n'Now, reader,' writes the delighted recipient, 'was not this glorious?\r\nAnd you, young student, when you are pressed down by want in the midst\r\nof a great work, remember what followed Haydon's perseverance. The\r\nfreedom of his native town, the visit of Canova, and the sonnet of\r\nWordsworth, and if that do not cheer you up, and make you go on, you\r\nare past all hope.... It had, indeed, been a wonderful year for me.\r\nThe Academicians were silenced. All classes were so enthusiastic and\r\nso delighted that, though I had lost seven months with weak eyes, and\r\nhad only accomplished The Penitent Girl, The Mother, The Centurion and\r\nthe Samaritan Woman, yet they were considered so decidedly in advance\r\nof all I had yet done, that my painting-room was crowd by rank,\r\nbeauty, and fashion, and the picture was literally taken up as an\r\nhonour to the nation.'\r\n\r\nBut, alas! neither the sonnets of poets nor the homage of the great\r\nwould pay for models and colours, or put bread into the artist's\r\nmouth. Haydon could only live by renewed borrowing, for which method\r\nof support he endeavours, without much success, to excuse himself.\r\nOnce in the clutches of professional money-lenders, he confesses that\r\n'the fine edge of honour was dulled. Though my honourable discharge of\r\nwhat I borrowed justified my borrowing again, yet it is a fallacious\r\nrelief, because you must stop sooner or later; if you are punctual,\r\nand if you can pay in the long-run, why incur the debt at all? Too\r\nproud to do small, modest things, that I might obtain fair means of\r\nsubsistence as I proceeded with my great work, I thought it no\r\ndegradation to borrow, to risk the insult of refusal, and be bated\r\ndown like the meanest dealer. Then I was liberal in my art; I spared\r\nno expense for casts and prints, and did great things for the art by\r\nmeans of them.... Ought I, after such efforts as I had made, to have\r\nbeen left in this position by the Directors of the British Gallery or\r\nthe Government?'\r\n\r\nThe year 1816 was distinguished in Haydon's life as the epoch of his\r\nfirst, or, more accurately, his last serious love-affair. He was of a\r\nsusceptible temperament, and seems to have been a favourite with\r\nwomen, whom he inspired with his own strong belief in himself; but he\r\ndemanded much of the woman who was to be his wife, and hitherto he had\r\nnot found one who seemed worthy of that exalted position. He had long\r\nbeen acquainted with Maria Foote, the actress, for whom he entertained\r\na qualified admiration, and by her he was taken one day to a friend's\r\nhouse where, 'In one instant, the loveliest face that was ever created\r\nsince God made Eve, smiled gently at my approach. The effect of her\r\nbeauty was instantaneous. On the sofa lay a dying man and a boy about\r\ntwo years old. We shortly took leave. I never spoke a word, and after\r\nseeing M---- home, I returned to the house, and stood outside, in\r\nhopes that she would appear at the window. I went home, and for the\r\nfirst time in my life was really, heartily, thoroughly, passionately\r\nin love. I hated my pictures. I hated the Elgin Marbles. I hated\r\nbooks. I could not eat, or sleep, or think, or write, or talk. I got\r\nup early, examined the premises and street, and gave a man\r\nhalf-a-crown to let me sit concealed, and watch for her coming out.\r\nDay after day I grew more and more enraptured, till resistance was\r\nrelinquished with a glorious defiance of restraint. Her conduct to her\r\ndying husband, her gentle reproof of my impassioned air, riveted my\r\nbeing. But I must not anticipate. Sufficient for the present, O\r\nreader, is it to tell thee that B. R. Haydon is, and for ever will be,\r\nin love with that woman, and that she is his wife.'\r\n\r\nThe first note that Haydon has preserved from his friend Keats is\r\ndated November 1816, and runs:\r\n\r\n\r\n'MY DEAR SIR,--Last evening wrought me up, and I cannot forbear\r\nsending you the following.--Yours imperfectly,\r\n\r\nJOHN KEATS.'\r\n\r\nThe 'following' was nothing less than the noble sonnet,\r\nbeginning--'Great spirits now on earth are sojourning,' with an\r\nallusion to Haydon in the lines:\r\n\r\n  'And lo! whose steadfastness would never take\r\n  A meaner sound than Raphael's whispering.'\r\n\r\nHaydon wrote an enthusiastic letter of thanks, gave the young poet\r\nsome good advice, and promised to send his sonnet to Wordsworth.\r\n'Keats,' he records, 'was the only man I ever met who seemed and\r\nlooked conscious of a high calling, except Wordsworth. Byron and\r\nShelley were always sophisticating about their verses; Keats\r\nsophisticated about nothing. He had made up his mind to do great\r\nthings, and when he found that by his connection with the\r\n_Examiner_ clique he had brought upon himself an overwhelming\r\noutcry of unjust aversion, he shrank up into himself, his diseased\r\ntendencies showed themselves, and he died a victim to mistakes, on the\r\npart of friends and enemies alike.'\r\n\r\nHaydon gives a curious account of his first meeting with Shelley,\r\nwhich took place in the course of this year. The occasion was a\r\ndinner-party at James Smith's house, when Keats and Horace Smith were\r\nalso among the guests. 'I seated myself,' writes Haydon,' right\r\nopposite Shelley, as I was told afterwards, for I did not then know\r\nwhat hectic, spare, weakly, yet intellectual-looking creature it was,\r\ncarving a bit of broccoli or cabbage in his plate, as if it had been\r\nthe substantial wing of a chicken. In a few minutes Shelley opened the\r\nconversation by saying in the most feminine and gentle voice, \"As to\r\nthat detestable religion, the Christian--\" I looked astounded, but\r\ncasting a glance round the table, I easily saw that I was to be set at\r\nthat evening _vi et armis_.... I felt like a stag at bay, and\r\nresolved to gore without mercy. Shelley said the Mosaic and Christian\r\ndispensation were inconsistent. I swore they were not, and that the\r\nTen Commandments had been the foundation of all the codes of law on\r\nthe earth. Shelley denied it. I affirmed they were, neither of us\r\nusing an atom of logic.' This edifying controversy continued until all\r\nparties grew very warm, and said unpleasant things to one another.\r\nAfter this dinner, Haydon made up his mind to subject himself no more\r\nto the chance of these discussions, but gradually to withdraw from\r\nthis freethinking circle.\r\n\r\nThe chief artistic events of the year, from our hero's point of view,\r\nwere, the final settlement of the Elgin Marbles question, and his own\r\nattempt to found a school. The Committee appointed by Government to\r\nexamine and report upon the Marbles refused to call Haydon as a\r\nwitness on Lord Elgin's side, but the artist embodied his views on the\r\nsubject in a paper which appeared in both the _Examiner_ and the\r\n_Champion_. This article, which was afterwards translated into\r\nFrench and Italian, contained a scathing attack on Payne Knight, and\r\nwas said by Sir Thomas Lawrence to have saved the Elgin Marbles, and\r\nruined Haydon. However this may be, the Government, it will be\r\nremembered, decided to buy the treasures for £35,000, a sum\r\nconsiderably less than that which Lord Elgin had spent on bringing\r\nthem to England.\r\n\r\nThe School of Haydon was first instituted with three distinguished\r\npupils in the persons of the three Landseer brothers, to whom were\r\nafterwards added William Bewick, Eastlake, Harvey, Lance, and\r\nChatfield. Haydon set his disciples to draw from the Raphael Cartoons,\r\ntwo of which were brought up from Hampton Court to the British\r\nGallery, and, as soon as they were sufficiently advanced, he sent them\r\nto the Museum to draw from the Elgin Marbles. 'Their cartoons,' he\r\nwrites, 'drawn full size, of the Fates, of Theseus and the Ilissus,\r\nliterally made a noise in Europe. An order came from the great Goethe\r\nat Weimar for a set for his own house, the furniture of which having\r\nbeen since bought by the Government, and the house kept up as it was\r\nin Goethe's time, the cartoons of my pupils are thus preserved, whilst\r\nin England the rest are lying about in cellars and corners/ The early\r\ndays of the School thus held out a promise for the future, which\r\nunfortunately was not fulfilled. Haydon contrived to involve two or\r\nthree of his pupils in his own financial embarrassments, by inducing\r\nthem to sign accommodation bills, a proceeding which broke up the\r\nestablishment, and brought a lasting stain upon his reputation.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 Haydon was introduced to Miss Mitford, who greatly admired his\r\nwork, and a warm friendship sprang up between the pair. In May, Miss\r\nMitford wrote to Sir William Elford: 'The charm of the Exhibition is a\r\nchalk-drawing by Mr. Haydon taken, _as he tells me_, from a\r\nmother who had lost her child. It is the very triumph of expression. I\r\nhave not yet lost the impression which it made upon my mind and\r\nsenses, and which vented itself in a sonnet.' A visit to the studio\r\nfollowed, and Miss Mitford was charmed with the room, the books, the\r\ngreat unfinished picture, and the artist himself--with his\r\n_bonhomie_, _naïveté_, and enthusiasm. With all her heart she\r\nadmires the noble, independent spirit of Haydon, who, she\r\ndeclares, is quite one of the old heroes come to life again--one of\r\nShakespeare's men, full of spirit, endurance, and moral courage. She\r\nconcludes her account with an expression of regret that he should be\r\n'such a fright.' Now Haydon is generally described by his\r\ncontemporaries as a good-looking man, though short in stature, with an\r\nantique head, aquiline features, and fine dark eyes. His later\r\nportraits are chiefly remarkable for the immensely wide mouth with\r\nwhich he seems to be endowed, but in an early sketch by Wilkie he is\r\nrepresented as a picturesque youth with an admirably modelled profile.\r\n\r\nTo Miss Mitford we owe a quaint anecdote of our hero, which, better\r\nthan pages of analysis, depicts the man. It appears that Leigh Hunt,\r\nwho was a great keeper of birthdays and other anniversaries, took it\r\ninto his head to celebrate the birthday of Papa Haydn by giving a\r\ndinner, drinking toasts, and crowning the composer's bust with\r\nlaurels. Some malicious person told Haydon that the Hunts were\r\ncelebrating his birthday, a compliment that struck him as natural and\r\nwell deserved. Hastening to Hampstead, he broke in upon the company,\r\nand addressed to them a formal speech, in which he thanked them for\r\nthe honour they had done him, but explained that they had made a\r\nlittle mistake in the day! As a pendant to this anecdote, Miss Mitford\r\nrelates that Haydon told her he had painted the head of his Christ\r\nseven times, and that the final head was a portrait of himself. It is\r\nonly fair to remember that he always regarded it as the least\r\nsuccessful part of the work.\r\n\r\nWhile the picture was in progress, Haydon decided to put in a side\r\ngroup with Voltaire as a sceptic, and Newton as a believer. This idea,\r\nfounded on the intentional anachronisms of some of the old masters,\r\nwas afterwards extended, Hazlitt being introduced as an investigator,\r\nand Wordsworth bowing in reverence, with Keats in the background. The\r\ntwo poets had never yet met in actual life, but in December 1817,\r\nWordsworth being then on a visit to London, Haydon invited Keats to\r\nmeet him. The other guests were Charles Lamb and Monkhouse.\r\n'Wordsworth was in fine cue,' writes Haydon, 'and we had a glorious\r\nset-to-on Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Virgil. Lamb got exceedingly\r\nmerry, and exquisitely witty, and his fun, in the midst of\r\nWordsworth's solemn intonations of oratory, was like the sarcasm and\r\nwit of the fool in the intervals of Lear's passion.' Although the\r\nspecimens of wit recorded no longer seem inspired, we can well believe\r\nHaydon's statement that it was an immortal evening, and that in all\r\nhis life he never passed a more delightful time. We have abundant\r\ntestimony to the fact that the artist-host was himself an\r\nexceptionally fine talker. Hazlitt said that 'Haydon talked well on\r\nmost subjects that interest one; indeed, better than any painter I\r\never met.' Wordsworth and Talfourd echoed this opinion, and Miss\r\nMitford tells us that he was a most brilliant talker--racy, bold,\r\noriginal, and vigorous, 'a sort of Benvenuto Cellini, all air and\r\nfire.'\r\n\r\nIt was not until January 1820 that the 'Entry into Jerusalem' was\r\nfinished, when the artist, though absolutely penniless, engaged the\r\ngreat room at the Egyptian Hall for its exhibition, at a rent of £300.\r\nHis friends helped him over the incidental expenses, and in a state of\r\nfeverish excitement he awaited the opening day. Public curiosity had\r\nbeen aroused about the work, and early in the afternoon there was a\r\nblock of carriages in Piccadilly; the passage was thronged with\r\nservants, and soon the artist was holding what he described as a\r\n'regular rout at noonday.' While Keats and Hazlitt were rejoicing in a\r\ncorner, Mrs. Siddons swept in, and in her loud, deep, tragic tones,\r\ndeclared that the head of Christ was completely successful. By her\r\nfavourable verdict, Haydon, who had his doubts, was greatly consoled,\r\nnot because Mrs. Siddons had any reputation as an art-critic, but\r\nbecause he recognised that she was an expert on the subject of\r\ndramatic expression. A thousand pounds was offered for the picture and\r\nrefused, while the net profits from the exhibition, in London alone,\r\namounted to £1300. Haydon has been commonly represented as an unlucky\r\nman, who was always neglected by the public and the patrons, and never\r\nmet with his professional deserts. But up to this time, as has been\r\nseen, he had found ready sympathy and admiration from the public,\r\npractical aid during the time of struggle from his friends, and a fair\r\nreward for his labours. With the exhibition of the 'Entry into\r\nJerusalem,' his reputation was at its zenith; a little skilful\r\nengineering of the success thus gained might have extricated him from\r\nhis difficulties, and enabled him to keep his head above water for the\r\nremainder of his days. But, owing chiefly to his own impracticability,\r\nhis story from this point is one of decline, gradual at first, but\r\nincreasing in velocity, until the end came in disaster and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nEven while Haydon was in the first flush of his success, there were\r\nsigns that he had achieved no lasting triumph. Sir George Beaumont\r\nproposed that the British Gallery should buy the great picture, but\r\nthe Directors refused to give the price asked--£2000. An effort to\r\nsell it by subscription fell through, only, £200 being paid into\r\nCoutts'. When the exhibition closed in London, Haydon took his\r\nmasterpiece to Scotland, and showed it both in Edinburgh and in\r\nGlasgow, netting another £900, which, however, was quickly eaten up by\r\nhungry creditors. The picture was too big to tempt a private\r\npurchaser, and in spite of the admiration it had aroused, it remained\r\nlike a white elephant upon its creator's hands.\r\n\r\nOn his return to town, after being fêted by Sir Walter Scott,\r\nLockhart, and 'Christopher North,' Haydon finished his commission for\r\nSir George Phillips, 'Christ Sleeping in the Garden,' which, he\r\nfrankly admitted, was one of the worst pictures he ever painted.\r\nScarcely was this off his easel than he was inspired with a tremendous\r\nconception for the 'Raising of Lazarus.' He ordered a canvas such as\r\nhis soul loved, nineteen feet long by fifteen high, and dashed in his\r\nfirst idea. He was still deeply in debt, still desperately in love\r\n(his lady was now a widow), and the new picture would take at least\r\ntwo years to paint. Nevertheless, he worked away with all his\r\ncustomary energy, and prayed fervently that he might paint a great\r\nmasterpiece, never doubting but that his prayers would be heard.\r\n\r\nWith the end of this year, 1820, Haydon's Autobiography breaks off,\r\nand the rest of his life is told in his Journals and Letters. At the\r\nbeginning of 1821, when he was fairly at work on his Lazarus, he\r\nconfides to his Journal his conviction that difficulties are to be his\r\nlot in pecuniary matters, and adds: 'My plan must be to make up my\r\nmind to meet them, and fag as I can--to lose no single moment, but\r\nseize on time that is free from disturbance, and make the most of it.\r\nIf I can float, and keep alive attention to my situation through\r\nanother picture, I will reach the shore. I am now clearly in sight of\r\nit, and I will yet land to the sound of trumpets, and the shouts of my\r\nfriends.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of his absorption in his work, Haydon found time for the\r\nsociety of his literary friends. On March 7, he records: 'Sir Walter\r\nScott, Lamb, Wilkie, and Procter have been with me all the morning,\r\nand a delightful morning we have had. Scott operated on us like\r\nchampagne and whisky mixed.... It is singular how success and the want\r\nof it operate on two extraordinary men, Walter Scott and Wordsworth.\r\nScott enters a room and sits at table with the coolness and\r\nself-possession of conscious fame; Wordsworth with a mortified\r\nelevation of the head, as if fearful he was not estimated as he\r\ndeserved. Scott can afford to talk of trifles, because he knows the\r\nworld will think him a great man who condescends to trifle; Wordsworth\r\nmust always be eloquent and profound, because he knows that he is\r\nconsidered childish and puerile.... I think that Scott's success would\r\nhave made Wordsworth insufferable, while Wordsworth's failures would\r\nnot have rendered Scott a whit less delightful. Scott is the companion\r\nof Nature in all her moods and freaks, while Wordsworth follows her\r\nlike an apostle, sharing her solemn moods and impressions.'\r\n\r\nIn these rough notes, unusual powers of observation and insight into\r\ncharacter are displayed. That Haydon also had a keen sense of humour\r\nis proved by his account of an evening at Mrs. Siddons' where the\r\nhostess read aloud _Macbeth_ to her guests. 'She acts Macbeth\r\nherself much better than either Kemble or Kean,' he writes. 'It is\r\nextraordinary the awe that this wonderful woman inspires. After her\r\nfirst reading the men retired to tea. While we were all eating toast\r\nand tinkling cups and saucers, she began again. It was like the effect\r\nof a mass-bell at Madrid. All noise ceased; we slunk to our seats like\r\nboors, two or three of the most distinguished men of the day, with the\r\nvery toast in their mouths, afraid to bite. It was curious to see\r\nLawrence in this predicament, to hear him bite by degrees, and then\r\nstop, for fear of making too much crackle, his eyes full of water from\r\nthe constraint; and at the same time to hear Mrs. Siddons' 'eye of\r\nnewt and toe of frog,' and to see Lawrence give a sly bite, and then\r\nlook awed, and pretend to be listening.'\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1821 Haydon lost two intimate friends, John Scott,\r\nwho was killed by Christie in the Blackwood duel, and Keats, who died\r\nat Rome on February 23. He briefly sums up his impressions of the dead\r\npoet in his Journal. 'In fireside conversation he was weak and\r\ninconsistent, but he was in his glory in the fields.... He was the\r\nmost unselfish of human creatures: unadapted to this world, he cared\r\nnot for himself, and put himself to inconvenience for the sake of his\r\nfriends. He had an exquisite sense of humour, and too refined a notion\r\nof female purity to bear the little arts of love with patience.... He\r\nbegan life full of hopes, fiery, impetuous, ungovernable, expecting\r\nthe world to fall at once beneath his powers. Unable to bear the\r\nsneers of ignorance or the attacks of envy, he began to despond, and\r\nflew to dissipation as a relief. For six weeks he was scarcely sober,\r\nand to show what a man does to gratify his appetites when once they\r\nget the better of him, he once covered his tongue and throat, as far\r\nas he could reach, with Cayenne pepper, in order to appreciate the\r\n\"delicious coldness of claret in all its glory\"--his own expression.'\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1821, is entered in the Journal as 'A remarkable day in my\r\nlife. I am arrested!' This incident, unfortunately, became far too\r\ncommon in after-days to be at all remarkable, but the first touch of\r\nthe bailiff's hand was naturally something of a shock, and Haydon\r\nfilled three folio pages with angry comments on the iniquity of the\r\nlaws against debtors. He was able, however, to arrange the affair\r\nbefore night, and the sheriff's officer, whose duty it was to keep him\r\nin safe custody during the day, was so profoundly impressed by the\r\nsight of the Lazarus, that he allowed his prisoner to go free on\r\nparole. This incident has been likened to that of the bravoes arrested\r\nin their murderous intent by the organ-playing of Stradella; and also\r\nto the case of the soldiers of the Constable who, when sacking Rome,\r\nbroke into Parmigiano's studio, but were so struck by the beauty of\r\nhis pictures that they protected him and his property.\r\n\r\nIn despite of debts, difficulties, and the lack of commissions,\r\nHaydon, who had now been in love for five years, was married on\r\nOctober 10, 1821, to the young widow, Mary Hyman, who was blessed with\r\ntwo children, and a jointure of fifty pounds a year. His Journal for\r\nthis period is full of raptures over his blissful state, as also are\r\nhis letters to his friends. To Miss Mitford he writes from Windsor,\r\nwhere the honeymoon was spent: 'Here I am, sitting by my dearest Mary\r\nwith all the complacency of a well-behaved husband, writing to you\r\nwhile she is working quietly on some unintelligible part of a lady's\r\ncostume. You do not know how proud I am of saying _my wife_. I\r\nnever felt half so proud of Solomon or Macbeth, as I am of being the\r\nhusband of this tender little bit of lovely humanity.... There never\r\nwas such a creature; and although her face is perfect, and has more\r\nfeeling in it than Lady Hamilton's, her manner to me is perfectly\r\nenchanting, and more bewitching than her beauty. I think I shall put\r\nover my painting-room door, \"Love, solitude, and painting.\"' On the\r\nlast day of the year, according to his wont, Haydon sums up his\r\nfeelings and impressions of the past twelve months. 'I don't know how\r\nit is, but I get less reflective as I get older. I seem to take things\r\nas they come without thought. Perhaps being married to my dearest\r\nMary, and having no longer anything to hope in love, I get more\r\ncontent with my lot, which, God knows, is rapturous beyond\r\nimagination. Here I sit sketching, with the loveliest face before me,\r\nsmiling and laughing, and \"solitude is not.\" Marriage has increased my\r\nhappiness beyond expression. In the intervals of study, a few minutes'\r\nconversation with a creature one loves is the greatest of all reliefs.\r\nGod bless us both! My pecuniary difficulties are great, but my love is\r\nintense, my ambition is intense, and my hope in God's protection\r\ncheering. Bewick, my pupil, has realised my hopes in his picture of\r\n\"Jacob and Rachel.\" But it is cold work talking of pupils when one's\r\nsoul is full of a beloved woman! I am really and truly in love, and\r\nwithout affectation, I can talk, write, or think of nothing else.'\r\n\r\nBut if a love-match brings increased happiness, it also brings\r\nweightier cares and responsibilities. Haydon's credit had been in a\r\nmeasure restored by the success of his last picture, but his creditors\r\nseemed to resent his marriage, and during the months that followed,\r\ngave him little peace. He was obliged, in the intervals of painting,\r\nto rush hither and thither to pacify this creditor, quiet the fears of\r\nthat, remove the ill-will of a third, and borrow money at usurious\r\ninterest from a fourth in order to keep his engagements with a fifth.\r\nIn spite of all his compromises and arrangements, he was arrested more\r\nthan once during this year, but so far he had been able to keep out of\r\nprison. His favourite pupil Bewick, who sat to him for the head of\r\nLazarus (being appropriately pale and thin from want of food) has left\r\nan account of the difficulties under which the picture was painted. 'I\r\nthink I see the painter before me,' he writes, 'his palette and\r\nbrushes in the left hand, returning from the sheriff's officer in the\r\nadjoining room, pale, calm, and serious--no agitation--mounting his\r\nhigh steps and continuing his arduous task, and as he looks round to\r\nhis pallid model, whispering, \"Egad, Bewick, I have just been\r\narrested; that is the third time. If they come again, I shall not be\r\nable to go on.\"'\r\n\r\nOn December 7, the Lazarus was finished, and five days later Haydon's\r\neldest son Frank was born. The happy father was profoundly moved by\r\nhis new responsibilities, as well as by his wife's suffering and\r\ndanger. On the last day of 1822 he thanks his Maker for the happiest\r\nyear of his life, and also 'for being permitted to finish another\r\ngreat picture, which must add to my reputation, and go to strengthen\r\nthe art.... Grant it triumphant success. Grant that I may soon begin\r\nthe \"Crucifixion,\" and persevere with that, until I bring it to a\r\nconclusion equally positive and glorious.' Haydon's prayers, which\r\nhave been not inaptly described as 'begging letters to the Almighty,'\r\nare invariably couched in terms that would be appropriate in an appeal\r\nto the President of a Celestial Academy. As his biographer points out,\r\nhe prayed as though he would take heaven by storm, and although he\r\noften asked for humility, the demands for this gift bore very little\r\nproportion to those for glories and triumphs.\r\n\r\nThe Lazarus, though it showed signs of haste and exaggeration, natural\r\nenough considering the conditions under which it was painted, was\r\nacclaimed as a great work, and the receipts from its exhibition were\r\nof a most satisfactory nature, mounting up to nearly two hundred\r\npounds a week. Instead of calling his creditors together, and coming\r\nto some arrangement with them, Haydon, rendered over-confident by\r\nsuccess, spent his time in preparing a new and vaster canvas for his\r\nconception of the Crucifixion. The sight of crowds of people paying\r\ntheir shillings to view the Lazarus roused the cupidity of one of the\r\ncreditors, who, against his own interests, killed the goose that was\r\nlaying golden eggs. On April 13, an execution was put in, and the\r\npicture was seized. A few days later Haydon was arrested, and carried\r\nto the King's Bench, his house was taken possession of, and all his\r\nproperty was advertised for sale.\r\n\r\nOn April 22, he dates the entry in his Journal, 'King's Bench,' and\r\nconsoles himself with the reflection that Bacon, Raleigh, and\r\nCervantes had also suffered imprisonment. His friends rallied round\r\nhim at this melancholy period. Lord Mulgrave, Sir George Beaumont,\r\nScott and Wilkie, giving not only sympathy but practical help. At his\r\nforced sale a portion of his casts and painting materials was bought\r\nin by his friends in order that he might be enabled to set to work\r\nagain as soon as he was released from prison. A meeting of creditors\r\nwas called, and Haydon addressed to them a characteristic letter,\r\nbegging to be spared the disgrace of 'taking the Act,' and complaining\r\nof the hardship of his treatment in being torn from his family and his\r\nart, after devoting the best years of his life to the honour of his\r\ncountry. But as the creditors cared nothing for the honour of the\r\ncountry, he was compelled to pass through the Bankruptcy Court, and on\r\nJuly 25 he regained his freedom. It was now his desire to return to\r\nhis dismantled house, and, without a bed to lie upon, or a shilling in\r\nhis pocket, to finish his gigantic 'Crucifixion.' But his wife, the\r\nlong-suffering Mary, persuaded him to abandon this idea, to retire to\r\nmodest lodgings for a time, and to paint portraits and cabinet-pictures\r\nuntil better fortune dawned.\r\n\r\nHaydon yielded to her desire, but he never ceased to regret what he\r\nconsidered his degradation. He would have preferred to allow his\r\nfriends and creditors to support himself and his family, while he\r\nworked at a canvas of unsaleable size, a proceeding that most men\r\nwould regard as involving a deeper degradation than painting\r\npot-boilers.\r\n\r\nHaydon began his new career by painting the 'portrait of a gentleman.'\r\n'Ah, my poor lay-figure,' he groans, 'he, who bore the drapery of\r\nChrist and the grave-clothes of Lazarus, the cloak of the centurion\r\nand the gown of Newton, was to-day disgraced by a black coat and\r\nwaistcoat. I apostrophised him, and he seemed to sympathise, and bowed\r\nhis head as if ashamed to look me in the face.' Haydon's detestation\r\nof portrait-painting probably arose from the secret consciousness that\r\nhe was not successful in this branch of his art. His taste for the\r\ngrandiose led him to depict his sitters larger than life, if not\r\n'twice as natural.' His objection to painting small pictures was\r\npartly justified by his weakness of sight. It was easy for him to dash\r\nin heads on a large scale in a frenzy of inspiration, but he seemed to\r\nlack the faculty for 'finish.' The faults of disproportion and\r\napparent carelessness that disfigure many of his works, are easily\r\naccounted for by his method of painting, which is thus described by\r\nhis son Frederick, who often acted as artist's model:--\r\n\r\n'His natural sight was of little or no use to him at any distance, and\r\nhe would wear, one over the other, two or three pairs of large round\r\nconcave spectacles, so powerful as greatly to diminish objects. He\r\nwould mount his steps, look at you through one pair of glasses, then\r\npush them all back on his head, and paint by the naked eye close to\r\nthe canvas. After some minutes he would pull down one pair of his\r\nglasses, look at you, then step down, walk slowly backwards to the\r\nwall, and study the effect through one, two, or three pairs of\r\nspectacles; then with one pair only look long and steadily in the\r\nlooking-glass at the side to examine the reflection of his work; then\r\nmount his steps and paint again. How he ever contrived to paint a head\r\nor limb in proportion is a mystery to me, for it is clear that he had\r\nlost his natural sight in boyhood. He is, as he said, the first blind\r\nman who ever successfully painted pictures.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Haydon's self-denial in painting portraits was not well\r\nrewarded, for commissions were few, and the clouds began to gather\r\nagain. One of his sitters had to be appealed to for money for coals,\r\nand if such appeals were frequent, the scarcity of sitters was hardly\r\nsurprising. On one occasion he pawned all his books, except a few old\r\nfavourites, for three pounds, and entries like the following are of\r\nalmost daily occurrence in the Journal:--'Obliged to go out in the\r\nrain, I left my room with no coals in it, and no money to buy any....\r\nNot a shilling in the world. Sold nothing, and not likely to. Baker\r\ncalled, and was insolent. If he were to stop the supplies, God knows\r\nwhat would become of my children! Landlord called--kind and sorry.\r\nButcher called, respectful, but disappointed. Tailor good--humoured,\r\nand willing to wait.... Walked about the town. I was so full of grief,\r\nI could not have concealed it at home.'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all his harassing anxieties, Haydon was untiring in\r\nhis efforts to obtain employment of the heroic kind that his soul\r\ncraved. He had begun to realise that he had small chance of disposing\r\nof huge historical pictures to private patrons, and that his only hope\r\nrested with the Government. Even while confined in prison he had\r\npersuaded Brougham to present a petition to the House of Commons\r\nsetting forth the desirability of appointing a Committee to inquire\r\ninto the state of national art, and by a regular distribution of a\r\nsmall portion of the public funds, to give public encouragement to the\r\nprofessors of historical painting. No sooner did he regain his freedom\r\nthan Haydon attacked Sir Charles Long with a plan for the decoration\r\nof the great room of the Admiralty, to be followed by the decoration\r\nof the House of Lords and St. Paul's Cathedral. This was but the\r\nbeginning of a long series of impassioned pleadings with public men in\r\nfavour of national employment for historical painters. Silence, snubs,\r\nformal acknowledgments, curt refusals, all were lost upon Haydon, who\r\nkept pouring in page after page of agonised petition on Sir Charles\r\nLong, the Duke of Wellington, Lord Grey, Lord Melbourne, and Sir\r\nRobert Peel, and seemed to be making no way with any of them.\r\n\r\nHaydon thought himself ill-used, throughout his life, by statesmen and\r\npatrons, and many of his friends were of the same opinion. But both he\r\nand they ignored the fact that it is impossible to create an\r\nartificial market for works of art for which there is no spontaneous\r\npopular demand. A despotic prince may, if he chooses, give his court\r\npainter _carte blanche_ for the decorations of national buildings,\r\nand gain nothing but glory for his liberality, even when it\r\nis exercised at the expense of his people. But in a country that\r\npossesses a constitutional government, more especially when that\r\ncountry has been impoverished by long and costly wars, the minister\r\nwho devotes large sums to the encouragement of national art has the\r\nindignation of an over-taxed populace to reckon with. It is little\r\nshort of an insult to offer men historic frescoes when they are\r\nclamouring for bread. Haydon was unfortunate in his period, which was\r\nnot favourable for a crusade on behalf of high art. The recent\r\npacification of the Continent, and the opening up of its treasures,\r\ntempted English noblemen and plutocrats to invest their money in old\r\nmasters to the neglect of native artists, who were only thought worthy\r\nto paint portraits of their patrons' wives and children. We who have\r\ninherited the Peel, the Angerstein, and the Hertford collections, can\r\nscarcely bring ourselves to regret the sums that were lavished on\r\nFlemish and Italian masterpieces, sums that might have kept our Barrys\r\nand Haydons from bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIn January 1824 Haydon left his lodgings, and took the lease of a\r\nhouse in Connaught Terrace, for which he paid, or promised to pay, a\r\nhundred and twenty pounds a year, a heavy rent for a recently\r\ninsolvent artist. Fortunately, he acquired with the house a landlord\r\nof amazing benevolence, who took pot-boilers in lieu of rent, and\r\nmeekly submitted to abuse when nothing else was forthcoming. As soon\r\nas he was fairly settled, Haydon arranged the composition of a large\r\npicture of 'Pharaoh dismissing Moses,' upon which he worked in the\r\nintervals of portrait-painting. A curious and obviously impartial\r\nsketch of him, as he appeared at this time, is drawn by Borrow in his\r\n_Lavengro_. The hero's elder brother comes up to town, it may be\r\nremembered, to commission a certain heroic artist to paint an heroic\r\npicture of a very unheroic mayor of Norwich. The two brothers go\r\ntogether to the painter of Lazarus, and have some difficulty in\r\nobtaining admission to his studio, being mistaken by the servant for\r\nduns. They found a man of about thirty-five, with a clever,\r\nintelligent countenance, sharp grey eyes, and hair cut _à la_\r\nRaphael. He possessed, moreover, a broad chest, and would have been a\r\nvery fine figure if his legs had not been too short. He was then\r\nengaged upon his Moses, whose legs, in Lavengro's opinion, were also\r\ntoo short. His eyes glistened at the mention of a hundred pounds for\r\nthe mayor's portrait, and he admitted that he was confoundedly short\r\nof money. The painter was anxious that Lavengro should sit to him for\r\nhis Plutarch, which honour that gentleman firmly declined. Years\r\nafterwards he saw the portrait of the mayor, a 'mighty portly man,\r\nwith a bull's head, black hair, a body like a dray horse, and legs and\r\nthighs corresponding; a man six foot high at the least. To his bull's\r\nhead, black hair and body, the painter had done justice; there was one\r\npoint, however, in which the portrait did not correspond with the\r\noriginal--the legs were disproportionately short, the painter having\r\nsubstituted his own legs for those of the mayor, which, when I\r\nperceived, I rejoiced that I had not consented to be painted as\r\nPharaoh, for if I had, the chances are that he would have served me in\r\nexactly the same way as he had served Moses and the mayor.'\r\n\r\nThe painting of provincial mayors was so little to Haydon's taste that\r\nby the close of this year we find him in deep depression of spirits,\r\nunrelieved by even a spark of his old sanguine buoyancy. 'I candidly\r\nconfess,' he writes, 'I find my glorious art a bore. I cannot with\r\npleasure paint any individual head for the mere purpose of domestic\r\ngratification. I must have a great subject to excite public\r\nfeeling.... Alas! I have no object in life now but my wife and\r\nchildren, and almost wish I had not them, that I might sit still and\r\nmeditate on human grandeur and human ambition till I died.... I am not\r\nyet forty, and can tell of a destiny melancholy and rapturous, bitter\r\nbeyond all bitterness, cursed, heart-breaking, maddening. But I dare\r\nnot write now. The melancholy demon has grappled my heart, and crushed\r\nits turbulent beatings in his black, bony, clammy, clenching fingers.'\r\n\r\nIt was just when things seemed at their darkest, when the waters\r\nthreatened to overwhelm the unfortunate artist, that a rope was thrown\r\nto him. His legal adviser, Mr. Kearsley, a practical and prosperous\r\nman, came forward with an offer of help. He agreed to provide £300 for\r\none year on certain conditions, in order that Haydon might be freed\r\nfrom pressure for that period, and be in a position to ask a fair\r\nprice for his work. When not engaged on portraits, he was to paint\r\nhistorical pictures of a saleable size. The advance was to be secured\r\non a life insurance, and to be repaid out of the sale of the pictures,\r\nwith interest at four per cent. This offer was accepted with some\r\nreluctance, and the following year was one of comparative peace and\r\nquiet. The Journal gives evidence of greater ease of mind, and renewed\r\npleasure in work. Haydon's love for his wife waxed rather than waned\r\nwith the passing of the years, and his children, of whom he too soon\r\nhad the poor man's quiverful, were an ever-present delight. 'My\r\ndomestic happiness is doubled,' he writes about this time. 'Daily and\r\nhourly my sweet Mary proves the justice of my choice. My boy Frank\r\ngives tokens of being gifted at two years old, God bless him! My\r\nambition would be to make him a public man.... I have got into my old\r\ndelightful habits of study again. The mixture of literature and\r\npainting I really think the perfection of human happiness. I paint a\r\nhead, revel in colour, hit an expression, sit down fatigued, take up a\r\npoet or historian, write my own thoughts, muse on the thoughts of\r\nothers, and hours, troubles, and the tortures of disappointed ambition\r\npass and are forgotten.'\r\n\r\nPortraits, and one or two commissions for small pictures, kept Haydon\r\nafloat throughout this year, but a widespread commercial distress in\r\nthe early part of 1826 affected his gains, and in February he records\r\nthat for the last five weeks he has been suffering the tortures of the\r\nInferno. He was persuaded, much against his will, to send his pictures\r\nto the Academy, and he was proportionately annoyed at the adverse\r\ncriticism that greeted his attempts at portraiture. This attack he\r\nregarded as the result of a deep-laid plot to injure him in a\r\nlucrative branch of his art. He consoled himself by beginning a large\r\npicture of 'Alexander taming Bucephalus,' the 'finest subject on\r\nearth.' Through his friend and opposite neighbour, Carew the sculptor,\r\nHaydon made an appeal to Lord Egremont, that generous patron of the\r\narts, for help or employment, in response to which Lord Egremont\r\npromised to call and see the Alexander. There is a pathetic touch in\r\nthe account of this visit, on which so much depended. Lord Egremont\r\ncalled at Carew's house on his way, and Haydon, who saw him go in,\r\nrelates that 'Dear Mary and I were walking on the leads, and agreed\r\nthat it would not be quite right to look too happy, being without a\r\nsixpence; so we came in, I to the parlour to look through the blinds,\r\nand she to the nursery.' Happily, the patron was favourably impressed\r\nby the picture, and promised to give £600 for it when it was finished.\r\nIn order to pay his models Haydon was obliged to pawn one of his two\r\nlay-figures, since he could not bring himself to part with any more\r\nbooks. 'I may do without a lay-figure for a time,' he writes, 'but not\r\nwithout old Homer. The truth is I am fonder of books than of anything\r\non earth. I consider myself a man of great powers, excited to an art\r\nwhich limits their exercise. In politics, law, or literature they\r\nwould have had a full and glorious swing, and I should have secured a\r\ncompetence.'\r\n\r\nThe fact that Haydon was more at home among the literary men of his\r\nacquaintance than among his fellow-artists was a natural result of his\r\nintense love of books, and his keen interest in contemporary history.\r\nAnd it is evident that his own character and work impressed his\r\npoetical friends, for we find that not only Wordsworth and Keats, but\r\nLeigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, Miss Mitford, and Miss Barrett addressed to\r\nhim admiring verses. For Byron, whom he never knew, Haydon cherished\r\nan ardent admiration, and the following interesting passage, comparing\r\nthat poet with Wordsworth, occurs in one of his letters to Miss\r\nMitford, who had criticised Byron's taste:--\r\n\r\n'You are unjust, depend upon it,' he writes, 'in your estimate of\r\nByron's poetry, and wrong in ranking Wordsworth beyond him. There are\r\nthings in Byron's poetry so exquisite that fifty or five hundred years\r\nhence they will be read, felt, and adored throughout the world. I\r\ngrant that Wordsworth is very pure, very holy, very orthodox, and\r\noccasionally very elevated, highly poetical, and oftener insufferably\r\nobscure, starched, dowdy, anti-human, and anti-sympathetic, but he\r\nnever will be ranked above Byron, nor classed with Milton.... I\r\ndislike his selfish Quakerism, his affectation of superior virtue, his\r\nutter insensibility to the frailties, the beautiful frailties of\r\npassion. I was walking with him once in Pall Mall; we darted into\r\nChristie's. In the corner of the room was a beautiful copy of the\r\n\"Cupid and Psyche\" (statues) kissing. Cupid is taking her lovely chin,\r\nand turning her pouting mouth to meet his, while he archly bends down,\r\nas if saying, \"Pretty dear!\"... Catching sight of the Cupid as he and\r\nI were coming out, Wordsworth's face reddened, he showed his teeth,\r\nand then said in a loud voice, \"_The Dev-v-vils!_\" There's a\r\nmind! Ought not this exquisite group to have softened his heart as\r\nmuch as his old, grey-mossed rocks, his withered thorn, and his\r\ndribbling mountain streams? I am altered very much about Wordsworth\r\nfrom finding him too hard, too elevated, to attend to the voice of\r\nhumanity. No, give me Byron with all his spite, hatred, depravity,\r\ndandyism, vanity, frankness, passion, and idleness, rather than\r\nWordsworth with all his heartless communion with woods and grass.'\r\n\r\nAn attempt on Haydon's part to reconcile himself with his old enemies,\r\nthe Academicians, ended in failure. He heads his account of the\r\ntransaction, 'The disgrace of my life.' He was received with cold\r\ncivility by the majority of the artists to whom he paid conciliatory\r\nvisits, and when he put his name down for election, he received not a\r\nsingle vote. A more agreeable memory of this year was a visit to\r\nPetworth, where, as he records, with Pepysian _naiveté_, 'Lord\r\nEgremont has placed me in one of the most magnificent bedrooms I ever\r\nsaw. It speaks more of what he thinks of my talents than anything that\r\never happened to me.... What a destiny is mine! One year in the King's\r\nBench, the companion of gamblers and scoundrels--sleeping in\r\nwretchedness and dirt on a flock-bed--another reposing in down and\r\nvelvet in a splendid apartment in a splendid house, the guest of rank,\r\nfashion, and beauty.' Haydon's painting-room was now, as he loved to\r\nsee it, crowded with distinguished visitors, who were anxious to\r\ninspect the picture of Alexander before it was sent to the Exhibition.\r\nAmong them came Charles Lamb, who afterwards set down some impressions\r\nand suggestions in the following characteristic fashion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n'DEAR RAFFAELE HAYDON,\r\n\r\n'Did the maid tell you I came to see your picture? I think the face\r\nand bearing of the Bucephalus-tamer very noble, his flesh too\r\neffeminate or painty.... I had small time to pick out praise or blame,\r\nfor two lord-like Bucks came in, upon whose strictures my presence\r\nseemed to impose restraint; I plebeian'd off therefore.\r\n\r\n'I think I have hit on a subject for you, but can't swear it was never\r\nexecuted--I never heard of its being--\"Chaucer beating a Franciscan\r\nFriar in Fleet Street.\" Think of the old dresses, houses, etc. \"It\r\nseemeth that both these learned men (Gower and Chaucer) were of the\r\nInner Temple; for not many years since Master Buckley did see a record\r\nin the same house where Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for\r\nbeating a Franciscan Friar in Fleet Street.\"--_Chaucer's Life, by T.\r\nSpeght_.--Yours in haste (salt fish waiting).\r\n\r\n'C. LAMB.'\r\n\r\nIn June Haydon was again arrested, and imprisoned in the King's Bench.\r\nOnce more he appealed to Parliament by a petition presented by\r\nBrougham, and to the public through letters to the newspapers.\r\nParliament and the larger public turned a deaf ear, but private\r\nfriends rallied to his support. Scott, himself a ruined man, sent a\r\ncheque and a charming letter of sympathy, while Lockhart suggested\r\nthat a subscription should be raised to buy one or more pictures. A\r\npublic meeting of sympathisers was convened, at which it was stated\r\nthat Haydon's debts amounted to £1767, while his only available asset\r\nwas an unfinished picture of the 'Death of Eucles.' Over a hundred\r\npounds was subscribed in the room, and it was decided that the Eucles\r\nshould be raffled in ten-pound shares. The result of these efforts was\r\nthe release of the prisoner at the end of July.\r\n\r\nDuring this last term of imprisonment Haydon witnessed the masquerade,\r\nor mock election by his fellow-prisoners, and instantly decided that\r\nhe would paint the scene, which offered unique opportunities for both\r\nhumour and pathos. This picture, Hogarthian in type, was finished and\r\nexhibited before the close of the year. The exhibition was moderately\r\nsuccessful, but the picture did not sell, and Haydon was once more\r\nsinking into despair, when the king expressed a desire to have the\r\nwork sent down to Windsor for his inspection. Hopes were raised high\r\nonce more, and this time were not disappointed. George IV. bought the\r\n'Mock Election,' and promptly paid the price of five hundred guineas.\r\nThus encouraged, Haydon set to work with renewed spirit on a companion\r\npicture, 'Chairing the Member,' which was finished and exhibited, with\r\nsome earlier works, in the course of the summer. The king refused to\r\nbuy the new work, but it found a purchaser at £300, and the net\r\nreceipts from the two pictures and their exhibition amounted to close\r\nupon £1400, a sum which, observes Haydon, in better circumstances and\r\nwith less expense, would have afforded a comfortable independence for\r\nthe year!\r\n\r\nThe Eucles occupied the artist during the remainder of 1828, and early\r\nin 1829 he began a new Hogarthian subject, a Punch and Judy show. He\r\nwas still painting portraits when he could get sitters, and on April\r\n15, he notes: 'Finished one cursed portrait--have only one more to\r\ntouch, and then I shall be free. I have an exquisite gratification in\r\npainting portraits wretchedly. I love to see the sitters look as if\r\nthey thought, \"Can this be Haydon's--the great Haydon's painting?\" I\r\nchuckle. I am rascal enough to take their money, and chuckle more.' It\r\nmust be owned that Haydon thoroughly deserved his ill-success in this\r\nbranch of his art. When 'Punch' was finished the king sent for it to\r\nWindsor, but though he admired, he did not buy, and the picture\r\neventually passed into the possession of Haydon's old friend, Dr.\r\nDarling, who had helped him out of more than one difficulty. A large\r\nrepresentation of 'Xenophon and the Retreat of the Ten Thousand' was\r\nnow begun, but before it was finished the painter was once more in\r\ndesperate straits. In vain he sent up urgent petitions to his Maker\r\nthat he might be enabled to go through with this great work,\r\nexplaining in a parenthesis, 'It will be my greatest,' and concluding,\r\n'Bless its commencement, its progress, its conclusion, and its effect,\r\nfor the sake of the intellectual elevation of my great and glorious\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\nIn May 1830, Haydon was back again in the King's Bench, where he had\r\nbegun to feel quite at home. He presented yet another of his\r\ninnumerable petitions to Parliament in favour of Government\r\nencouragement of historical painting, through Mr. Agar Ellis, but as\r\nthe ministry showed no desire to encourage this particular historical\r\npainter, he passed through the Bankruptcy Court, and returned to his\r\nfamily on the 20th of July. During his period of detention, George IV.\r\nhad died, and Haydon has the following comment on the event:--'Thus\r\ndied as thoroughbred an Englishman as ever existed in this country. He\r\nadmired her sports, gloried in her prejudices, had confidence in her\r\nbottom and spirit, and to him alone is the destruction of Napoleon\r\nowing. I have lost in him my sincere admirer; and had not his wishes\r\nbeen continually thwarted, he would have given me ample and adequate\r\nemployment.'\r\n\r\nAlthough Haydon had regained his freedom, his chance of maintaining\r\nhimself and his rapidly increasing family by his art seemed as far\r\naway as ever. By October 15th he is at his wits' end again, and writes\r\nin his Journal: 'The harassings of a family are really dreadful. Two\r\nof my children are ill, and Mary is nursing. All night she was\r\nattending to the sick and hushing the suckling, with a consciousness\r\nthat our last shilling was going. I got up in the morning\r\nbewildered--Xenophon hardly touched--no money--butcher impudent--all\r\ntradesmen insulting. I took up my private sketch-book and two prints\r\nof Napoleon (from a small picture of 'Napoleon musing at St. Helena')\r\nand walked into the city. Hughes advanced me five guineas on the\r\nsketch-book; I sold my prints, and returned home happy with £8, 4s. in\r\nmy pocket.... (25th) Out selling my prints. Sold enough for\r\nmaintenance for the week. Several people looked hard at me with my\r\nroll of prints, but I feel more ashamed in borrowing money than in\r\nhonestly selling my labours. It is a pity the nobility drive me to\r\nthis by their neglect.'\r\n\r\nIn December came another stroke of good-luck. Sir Robert Peel called\r\nat the studio, and gave the artist a commission to paint, on a larger\r\nscale, a replica of his small sketch of 'Napoleon at St. Helena.'\r\nUnluckily, there was a misunderstanding about the price. Peel asked\r\nhow much Haydon charged for a whole length figure, and was told a\r\nhundred pounds, which was the price of an ordinary portrait. Taking\r\nthis to be the charge for the Napoleon, he paid no more. Haydon, who\r\nconsidered the picture well worth £500, was bitterly disappointed, and\r\ntook no pains to conceal his feelings. Peel afterwards sent him an\r\nextra thirty pounds, but the subject remained a grievance to Haydon\r\nfor the rest of his life, and Peel, who had intended to do the artist\r\na good turn, was so annoyed by his complaints, that he never gave him\r\nanother commission. The Napoleon, though its exhibition was not a\r\nsuccess, was one of Haydon's most popular pictures, and the engraving\r\nis well known. Wordsworth admired it exceedingly, and on June 12, sent\r\nthe artist the 'Sonnet to B. R. Haydon, composed on seeing his picture\r\nof Napoleon in the island of St. Helena,' beginning:\r\n\r\n  'Haydon! let worthier judges praise the skill.'\r\n\r\nThe close of this year was a melancholy period to poor Haydon. He lost\r\nhis little daughter, Fanny, and his third son, Alfred, was gradually\r\nfading away. Out of eight children born to this most affectionate of\r\nfathers, no fewer than five died in infancy from suffusion of the\r\nbrain, due, it was supposed, to the terrible mental distresses of\r\ntheir mother. 'I can remember,' writes Frederick Haydon, one of the\r\nthree survivors, 'the roses of her sunken cheeks fading away daily\r\nwith anxiety and grief. My father, who was passionately attached to\r\nboth wife and children, suffered the tortures of the damned at the\r\nsight before him. His sorrow over the deaths of his children was\r\nsomething more than human. I remember watching him as he hung over his\r\ndaughter Georgiana, and over his dying boy Harry, the pride and\r\ndelight of his life. Poor fellow, how he cried! and he went into the\r\nnext room, and beating his head passionately on the bed, called upon\r\nGod to take him and all of us from this dreadful world. The earliest\r\nand most painful death was to be preferred to our life at that time.'\r\n\r\nBy dint of borrowing in every possible quarter, generally at forty per\r\ncent. interest, and inducing his patrons to take shares in his\r\nXenophon, Haydon managed to get through the winter, though his\r\nchildren were often without stockings. William IV. consented to place\r\nhis name at the head of the subscribers' list, and Goethe wrote a\r\nflattering letter, expressing his desire to take a ticket for the\r\n'very valuable painting,' and assuring the artist that 'my soul has\r\nbeen elevated for many years by the contemplation of the important\r\npictures (the cartoons from the Elgin Marbles) formerly sent to me,\r\nwhich occupy an honourable station in my house.' Xenophon was\r\nexhibited in the spring of 1832 without attracting much attention, the\r\nwhole nation being engrossed with the subject of Reform. Haydon,\r\nthough a high Tory by birth and inclination, was an ardent champion of\r\nthe Bill, as he had been for that of Catholic Emancipation. His brush\r\nwas once more exchanged for the pen, and he not only poured out his\r\nthoughts upon Reform in his Journal, but wrote several letters on the\r\nsubject to the _Times_, which he considered the most wonderful\r\ncompositions of the kind that had ever been penned. After the passing\r\nof the Bill he congratulates himself upon having contributed to the\r\ngrand result, and adds: 'When my colours have faded, my canvas\r\ndecayed, and my body has mingled with the earth, these glorious\r\nletters, the best things I ever wrote, will awaken the enthusiasm of\r\nmy countrymen. I thanked God I lived in such a time, and that he\r\ngifted me with talent to serve the great cause.'\r\n\r\nOn reading the account of the monster meeting of the Trades Unions at\r\nNewhall Hill, Birmingham, it occurred to Haydon that the moment when\r\nthe vast concourse joined in the sudden prayer offered up by Hugh\r\nHutton, would make a fine subject for a picture. Accordingly, he wrote\r\nto Hutton, and laid the suggestion before him. The Birmingham leaders\r\nwere attracted by the idea, and the picture was begun, but support of\r\na material kind was not forthcoming, and the scheme had to be\r\nabandoned. Lord Grey then suggested that Haydon should paint a picture\r\nof the great Reform Banquet, which was to be held in the Guildhall on\r\nJuly 11. The proposal was exactly to the taste of the public-spirited\r\nartist, who saw fame and fortune beckoning to him once more, and\r\nfancied that his future was assured. He was allowed every facility on\r\nthe great day, breakfasted and dined with the Committee at the\r\nGuildhall, was treated with distinction by the noble guests, many of\r\nwhom sent to take wine with him as he sat at work, and in short, to\r\nquote his own words, 'I was an object of great distinction without\r\nfive shillings in my pocket--and this is life!'\r\n\r\nLord Grey, on seeing Haydon's sketches of the Banquet, gave him a\r\ncommission for the picture at a price of £500, half of which he paid\r\ndown at once, and thus saved the painter from the ruin that was again\r\nimpending. Then followed a period of triumphant happiness. The leading\r\nmen of the Liberal party sat for their heads, and Haydon had the\r\nlonged-for opportunity of pressing upon them his views about the\r\npublic encouragement of art by means of grants for the decoration of\r\nnational buildings. Although it does not appear that he made a single\r\nconvert, he was quite contented for the time being with the ready\r\naccess to ministers and noblemen that the occasion afforded him, and\r\nhis Journal is filled with expressions of his satisfaction. We hear of\r\nLord Palmerston's good-humoured elegance, Lord Lansdowne's amiability,\r\nLord Jeffrey's brilliant conversation, and, most delightful of all,\r\nLord Melbourne's frank, unaffected cordiality. Melbourne, it appears,\r\nenjoyed his sittings, for he asked many questions about Hazlitt, Leigh\r\nHunt, Keats, and Shelley, and highly appreciated Haydon's anecdotes.\r\nNeedless to add, he did not allow himself to be bored by the artist's\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nThe sittings for the Reform picture continued through 1833, and the\r\nearly part of 1834. Haydon was kept in full employment, but domestic\r\nsorrows marred his satisfaction in his interesting work. In less than\r\ntwelve months, he lost two sons, Alfred and Harry, the latter a child\r\nof extraordinary promise. 'The death of this beautiful boy,' he\r\nwrites, 'has given my mind a blow I shall never effectually recover. I\r\nsaw him buried to-day, after passing four days sketching his dear head\r\nin his coffin--his beautiful head. What a creature! With a brow like\r\nan ancient god!' In August Haydon was arrested again, and hurried away\r\nfor a day and night of torture, during which, he confesses, he was\r\nvery near putting an end to himself; but advances from the Duke of\r\nCleveland and Mr. Ellice brought him release, and in a few hours he\r\nwas at home again, 'as happy and as hard at work as ever.'\r\n\r\nIn April 1834, the Reform picture was exhibited, but the public was\r\nnot interested, and Haydon lost a considerable sum over the\r\nexhibition. The price of the commission had long since gone to quiet\r\nthe clamours of his creditors. On May 12 he writes: 'It is really\r\nlamentable to see the effect of success and failure on people of\r\nfashion. Last year, all was hope, exultation, and promise with me. My\r\ndoor was beset, my house besieged, my room inundated. It was an\r\nabsolute fight to get in to see me paint. Well, out came the work--the\r\npublic felt no curiosity--it failed, and my door is deserted, no\r\nhorses, no carriages. Now for executions, insults, misery, and\r\nwretchedness.' Then follows the old story. 'June 7.--Mary and I in\r\nagony of mind. All my Italian books, and some of my best historical\r\ndesigns, are gone to a pawnbroker's. She packed up her best gowns and\r\nthe children's, and I drove away with what cost me £40, and got £4.\r\nThe state of degradation, humiliation, and pain of mind in which I sat\r\nin that dingy back-room is not to be described.'\r\n\r\nHaydon now began a picture of 'Cassandra and Agamemnon,' and in July\r\nhe received a commission to finish it for the Duke of Sutherland, who\r\nhad more than once saved him from ruin. On this occasion the Duke's\r\nadvances barely sufficed to stave off disaster. Studies, prints,\r\nclothes, and lay-figures were pawned to pay for the expenses of the\r\nwork, and on October comes the entry: 'Directly after the Duke's\r\nletter came with its enclosed cheque, an execution was put in for the\r\ntaxes. I made the man sit for Cassandra's hand, and put on a Persian\r\nbracelet. When the broker came for his money, he burst out laughing.\r\nThere was the fellow, an old soldier, pointing in the attitude of\r\nCassandra--up right and steady as if on guard. Lazarus' head was\r\npainted just after an arrest; Eucles was finished from a man in\r\npossession; the beautiful face in Xenophon, after a morning spent in\r\nbegging mercy of lawyers; and now Cassandra's head was finished in an\r\nagony not to be described, and her hand completed from a broker's\r\nman.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 1884, the Houses of Parliament were burned down. 'Good\r\nGod!' writes Haydon, 'I am just returned from the terrific burning of\r\nthe Houses of Parliament. Mary and I went in a cab, and drove over the\r\nbridge. From the bridge it was sublime. We alighted, and went into a\r\npublic-house, which was full. The feeling among the people was\r\nextraordinary--jokes and radicalism universal.... The comfort is that\r\nthere is now a better prospect of painting the House of Lords. Lord\r\nGrey said there was no intention of taking the tapestry down; little\r\ndid he think how soon it would go.' Haydon's hopes now rose high. For\r\nmany years, as we have seen, he had been advocating, in season and out\r\nof season, the desirability of decorating national buildings with\r\nheroic paintings by native artists, and, with the need for new Houses\r\nof Parliament, it seemed as if at last his cause might triumph. Once\r\nmore he attacked the good-humoured but unimpressionable Lord\r\nMelbourne, and presented another petition to Parliament through Lord\r\nMorpeth. But in any case it would be years before the new buildings\r\nwere ready for decoration, and in the meantime he would have been\r\nentirely out of employment if his long-suffering landlord had not\r\nallowed him to paint off a debt with a picture of 'Achilles at the\r\nCourt of Lycomedes.'\r\n\r\nIn the summer of this year Mr. Ewart obtained his Select Committee to\r\ninquire into the best means of extending a knowledge of the arts and\r\nthe principles of design among the people; and further, to inquire\r\ninto the constitution of the Royal Academy, and the effects produced\r\nthereby. Haydon, overjoyed at such a sign of progress, determined to\r\naid the inquiry by giving a lecture on the subject at the London\r\nMechanics' Institute, under the auspices of Dr. Birkbeck. The lecture\r\nwas a success, for Haydon's natural earnestness and enthusiasm enabled\r\nhim to interest and impress an audience, and Dr. Birkbeck assured him\r\nthat he had made a 'hit.' This was the beginning of his career as a\r\nlecturer, by which for several years he earned a small but regular\r\nincome. But meanwhile ruin was again staring him in the face. On\r\nSeptember 26 he writes: 'The agony of my necessities is really\r\ndreadful. For this year I have principally supported myself by the\r\nhelp of my landlord, and by pawning everything of value I have\r\nleft.... Lay awake in misery. Threatened on all sides. Doubtful\r\nwhether to apply to the Insolvent Court to protect me, or let ruin\r\ncome. Improved the picture, and not having a shilling, sent out a pair\r\nof my spectacles, and got five shillings for the day. (29th) Sent the\r\ntea-urn off the table, and got ten shillings for the day. Shall call\r\nmy creditors together. In God I trust.'\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the creditors took place, and Haydon persuaded them to\r\ngrant him an extension of time until June, 1836. Thus relieved from\r\nimmediate anxiety he set to work on his picture with renewed zest. The\r\nmost remarkable trait about him, observes his son Frederick, was his\r\nsanguine buoyancy of spirits. 'Nothing ever depressed him long. He was\r\nthe most persevering, indomitable man I ever met. With us at home he\r\nwas always confident of doing better next year. But that next year\r\nnever came.... Blest as he was with that peculiar faculty of genius\r\nfor overcoming difficulties, he might have found life tame without\r\nthem. I remember his saying once, he was not sure he did not relish\r\nruin as a source of increased activity of mind.' But the struggle had\r\nbegun to tell upon his powers, if not upon his spirits, and he was now\r\npainting pictures for bread; repeating himself; despatching a work in\r\na few days that in better times he would have spent months over; ready\r\nto paint small things, since great ones would not sell; fighting\r\nmisery at the point of his brush, and obliged to eke out a livelihood\r\nby begging and borrowing, in default of worse expedients such as bills\r\nand cognovits. A less elastic temperament and a less vigorous\r\nconstitution would have broken down in one year of such a fight.\r\nHaydon kept it up for ten.'\r\n\r\nThe first half of 1836 went by in the usual struggle, and in September\r\nHaydon was thrown into prison for the fourth time. On November 17 he\r\npassed through the Insolvency Court, and on the following Sunday he\r\nrecords: 'Went to church, and returned thanks with all my heart and\r\nsoul for the great mercies of God to me and my family during my\r\nimprisonment.... (29th) Set my palette to-day, the first time these\r\neleven weeks and three days. I relished the oil; could have tasted the\r\ncolour; rubbed my cheeks with the brushes, and kissed the palette. Ah,\r\ncould I be let loose in the House of Lords!' In the absence of\r\ncommissions, he now turned to lecturing as a means of support. He\r\nlectured in Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham, as well as\r\nin London, and did good service by agitating for the establishment of\r\nlocal schools of design, and by arousing in the minds of the wealthy\r\nmiddle classes some faint appreciation of the claims of art.\r\n\r\nA valuable result of these lectures was the extension of Haydon's\r\nacquaintance among the shrewd merchant princes of the north, who\r\nrecognised his artistic sincerity, and were inclined to hold out to\r\nhim a helping hand. Through the influence of Mr. Lowndes, a Liverpool\r\nart-patron, Haydon received a commission to paint a picture of 'Christ\r\nblessing Little Children,' for the Blind Asylum at Liverpool, at a\r\nprice of £400. So elated was he at this unexpected piece of good\r\nfortune that, with characteristic sanguineness, he seems to have\r\nthought that all his troubles were at an end for ever. Even his pious\r\ndependence on heavenly support diminished with his freedom from care,\r\nand he notes in a Sunday entry: 'Went to church, but prosperity,\r\nthough it makes me grateful, does not cause me such perpetual\r\nreligious musings as adversity. When on a precipice, where nothing but\r\nGod's protection can save me, I delight in religious hope, but I am\r\nsorry to say my religion ever dwindles unless kept alive by risk of\r\nruin. My piety is never so intense as when in a prison, and my\r\ngratitude never so much alive as when I have just escaped from one.'\r\n\r\nThe year 1838 passed in comparative peace and comfort. The picture for\r\nthe asylum was finished about the end of August, when Haydon\r\ncongratulated his Maker on the fact that he (Haydon) had paid his rent\r\nand taxes, laid in his coals for the winter, and enjoyed health,\r\nhappiness, and freedom from debt--fresh debt, be it understood--ever\r\nsince this commission. Going down to Liverpool to hang his work, it\r\nwas proposed to him by Mr. Lowndes that he should paint a picture of\r\nthe Duke of Wellington on the field of Waterloo, twenty years after\r\nthe battle. This was a subject after Haydon's own heart, for the Duke\r\nhad always been his ideal hero, his king among men. Overflowing with\r\npride and delight, he prays that Providence will so bless this new\r\ncommission that 'the glorious city of Liverpool may possess the best\r\nhistorical picture, and the grandest effort of my pencil in\r\nportraiture. Inspired by history, I fear not making it the grandest\r\nthing.'\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool committee wrote to the Duke, to ask if he would consent\r\nto give sittings to Haydon, and received a promise that he would sit\r\nfor his head as soon as time could be found. Meanwhile, Haydon set to\r\nwork upon the horse, which was copied from portraits of Copenhagen.\r\nWhile he was thus engaged, D'Orsay called at the studio, and bestowed\r\nadvice and criticism upon the artist, which, for once, was thankfully\r\nreceived. Haydon relates how D'Orsay 'took my brush in his dandy\r\nglove, which made my heart ache, and lowered the hind-quarters by\r\nbringing over a bit of the sky. Such a dress! white greatcoat, blue\r\nsatin cravat, hair oiled and curling, hat of the primest curve, gloves\r\nscented with eau-de-Cologne, primrose in tint, skin in tightness. In\r\nthis prime of dandyism, he took up a nasty, oily, dirty hog-tool, and\r\nimmortalised Copenhagen by touching the sky. I thought after he was\r\ngone, \"This won't do--a Frenchman touch Copenhagen!\" So out I rubbed\r\nall he had touched, and modified his hints myself.'\r\n\r\nAs there was no chance of the Duke's being able to sit at this time,\r\nowing to the pressure of public business, Haydon made a flying visit\r\nto Brussels, in order to get local colour for the field of Waterloo. A\r\nfew weeks later he was overjoyed at receiving an invitation to spend a\r\nfew days at Walmer, when the Duke promised to give the desired\r\nsittings. On October 11, 1839, he went down 'by steam' to Walmer,\r\nwhere he was heartily welcomed by his host. His Journal contains a\r\nlong and minute account of his visit, from which one or two anecdotes\r\nmay be quoted. Haydon's fellow-guests were Sir Astley Cooper, Mr.\r\nArbuthnot, and Mr. Booth. The first evening the conversation turned,\r\namong other topics, upon the Peninsular War. 'The Duke talked of the\r\nwant of fuel in Spain-of what the troops suffered, and how whole\r\nhouses, so many to a division, were pulled down, and paid for, to\r\nserve as fuel. He said every Englishman who has a house goes to bed at\r\nnight. He found bivouacking was not suitable to the character of the\r\nEnglish soldier. He got drunk, and lay down under any hedge, and\r\ndiscipline was destroyed. But when he introduced tents, every soldier\r\nbelonged to his tent, and, drunk or sober, he got to it before he went\r\nto sleep. I said, \"Your grace, the French always bivouac.\" \"Yes,\" he\r\nreplied, \"because French, Spanish, and all other nations lie anywhere.\r\nIt is their habit. They have no homes.\"'\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after his return from hunting, the Duke gave a first\r\nsitting of an hour and a half. 'I hit his grand, manly, upright\r\nexpression,' writes Haydon. 'He looked like an eagle of the gods who\r\nhad put on human shape, and got silvery with age and service.... I\r\nfound that to imagine he could not go through any duty raised the\r\nlion. \"Does the light hurt your grace's eyes?\" \"Not at all,\" and he\r\nstared at the light as much as to say, \"I'll see if you shall make me\r\ngive in, Signor Light.\" 'Twas a noble head. I saw nothing of that\r\npeculiar expression of mouth the sculptors give him, bordering on\r\nsimpering. His colour was beautiful and fleshy, his lips compressed\r\nand energetic.' The next day, being Sunday, there was no sitting, but\r\nHaydon was charmed at sharing a pew with his hero, and deeply moved by\r\nthe simplicity and humility with which he followed the service.\r\n'Arthur Wellesley in the village church of Walmer,' he writes, 'was\r\nmore interesting to me than at the last charge of the Guards at\r\nWaterloo, or in all the glory and paraphernalia of his entry into\r\nParis.'\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Duke was afraid of being attacked by Haydon on\r\nthe burning question of a State grant for the encouragement of\r\nhistorical painting, a subject about which he had received and\r\nanswered many lengthy letters, for on each evening, when there was no\r\nparty, he steadily read a newspaper, the _Standard_ on Saturday,\r\nand the _Spectator_ on Sunday, while his guest watched him in\r\nsilent admiration. On the Monday morning, the hero came in for another\r\nsitting, looking extremely worn, his skin drawn tight over his face,\r\nhis eyes watery and aged, his head slightly nodding. 'How altered from\r\nthe fresh old man after Saturday's hunting,' says Haydon. 'It affected\r\nme. He looked like an aged eagle beginning to totter from its perch.'\r\nA second sitting in the afternoon concluded the business, and early\r\nnext morning Haydon left for town. 'It is curious,' he comments, 'to\r\nhave known thus the two great heads of the two great parties, the Duke\r\nand Lord Grey. I prefer the Duke infinitely. He is more manly, has no\r\nvanity, is not deluded by any flattery or humbug, and is in every way\r\na grander character, though Lord Grey is a fine, amiable, venerable,\r\nvain man.'\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the year, Haydon worked steadily, and finished\r\nhis picture. On December 2 he notes: 'It is now twenty-seven years\r\nsince I ordered my Solomon canvas. I was young--twenty-six. The whole\r\nworld was against me. I had not a farthing. Yet I remember the delight\r\nwith which I mounted my deal table and dashed it in, singing and\r\ntrusting in God, as I always do. When one is once imbued with that\r\nclear heavenly confidence, there is nothing like it. It has carried me\r\nthrough everything. I think my dearest Mary has not got it; I do not\r\nthink women have in general. Two years ago I had not a farthing,\r\nhaving spent it all to recover her health. She said to me, \"What are\r\nwe to do, my dear?\" I replied, \"Trust in God.\" There was something\r\nlike a smile on her face. The very next day came the order for £400\r\nfrom Liverpool, and ever since I have been employed.' Alas, poor Mary!\r\nwho had been chiefly occupied in bearing children and burying them,\r\nthat must have been rather a melancholy smile upon her faded face.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of 1840, Haydon seems to have been chiefly\r\nengaged in lecturing, the only picture on the stocks being a small\r\nreplica of his Napoleon Musing for the poet Rogers. In February he was\r\nenabled to carry out one of the dreams of his life, namely, the\r\ndelivery of a series of lectures upon art in the Ashmolean Museum at\r\nOxford, under the patronage of the Vice-Chancellor. The experiment was\r\na triumphant success, and he exclaims, with his usual pious fervour,\r\n'O God, how grateful ought I to be at being permitted the distinction\r\nof thus being the first to break down the barrier which has kept art\r\nbegging to be heard at the Universities.' He describes the occasion as\r\none of the four chief honours of his life, the other three being\r\nWordsworth's sonnet, 'High is our calling,' the freedom of his native\r\ntown, and a public dinner that was given in his honour at Edinburgh.\r\nOn March 14 he arrived home, 'full of enthusiasm and expecting (like\r\nthe Vicar of Wakefield) every blessing--expecting my dear Mary to hang\r\nabout my neck, and welcome me after my victory; when I found her out,\r\nnot calculating I should be home till dinner. I then walked into town,\r\nand when I returned she was at home, and hurt that I did not wait, so\r\nthis begat mutual allusions which were anything but loving or happy.\r\nSo much for anticipations of human happiness!'\r\n\r\nOn June 12,1840, Haydon notes: 'Excessively excited and exhausted. I\r\nattended the great Convention of the Anti-Slavery Society at\r\nFreemasons' Hall. Last Wednesday a deputation called on me from the\r\nCommittee, saying they wished for a sketch of the scene. The meeting\r\nwas very affecting. Poor old Clarkson was present, with delegates from\r\nAmerica, and other parts of the world.' A few days later, Haydon\r\nbreakfasted with Clarkson, and sketched him with 'an expression of\r\nindignant humanity.' In less than a week fifty heads were dashed in,\r\nthe picture, when finished, containing no fewer than a hundred and\r\nthirty-eight; in fact, as the artist remarked, with a curious\r\ndisregard of natural history, it was all heads, like a peacock's tail.\r\nHaydon took a malicious pleasure in suggesting to his sitters that he\r\nshould place them beside the negro delegate; this being his test of\r\ntheir sincerity. Thus he notes on June 30: 'Scobell called. I said, \"I\r\nshall place you, Thompson, and the negro together.\" Now an\r\nabolitionist, on thorough principle, would have gloried in being so\r\nplaced. He sophisticated immediately on the propriety of placing the\r\nnegro in the distance, as it would have much greater effect. Lloyd\r\nGarrison comes to-day. I'll try him, and this shall be my method of\r\nascertaining the real heart.... Garrison met me directly. George\r\nThompson said he saw no objection. But that was not enough. A man who\r\nwishes to place a negro on a level with himself must no longer regard\r\nhim as having been a slave, and feel annoyed at sitting by his side.'\r\nA visit to Clarkson at Playford Hall, Ipswich, was an interesting\r\nexperience. Clarkson told the story of his vision, and the midnight\r\nvoice that said 'You have not done your work. There is America.'\r\nHaydon had been a believer all his life in such spiritual\r\ncommunications, and declares, 'I have been so acted on from seventeen\r\nto fifty-five, for the purpose of reforming and refining my great\r\ncountry in art.'\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the Fine Arts Committee appointed to consider the question of\r\nthe decoration of the new Houses of Parliament, sat to examine\r\nwitnesses, but Haydon was not summoned before them, a slight which he\r\ndeeply felt. With an anxious heart he set about making experiments in\r\nfresco, and was astonished at what he regarded as his success in this\r\nnew line of endeavour. During the past year, the Anti-Slavery\r\nConvention picture, and one or two small commissions, had kept his\r\nhead above water, but now the clouds were beginning to gather again,\r\nhis difficulties being greatly increased by the fact that he had two\r\nsons to start in the world. The eldest, Frank, had been apprenticed,\r\nat his own wish, to an engineering firm, but tiring of his chosen\r\nprofession, he desired to take orders, and, as a university career was\r\nconsidered a necessary preliminary to this course, he was entered at\r\nCaius College, Cambridge. The second son, Frederick, Haydon fitted out\r\nfor the navy, and in order to meet these heavy extra expenses, he was\r\ncompelled to part with his copyright of the 'Duke at Waterloo' for a\r\nwholly inadequate sum.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1842 the Fine Arts Commission issued a notice of the\r\nconditions for the cartoon competition, intended to test the capacity\r\nof native artists for the decoration of the House of Lords. The joy\r\nwith which Haydon welcomed this first step towards the object which he\r\nhad been advocating throughout the whole of his working life, was\r\nmarred by the painful misgiving that he would not be allowed to share\r\nthe fruits of victory. When he had first begun his crusade, he had\r\nfelt himself without a rival in his own branch of art, not one of his\r\ncontemporaries being able to compete with him in a knowledge of\r\nanatomy, in strength of imagination, or in the power of working on a\r\ngrand scale. But now he was fifty-six years old, there were younger\r\nmen coming on who had been trained in the principles of his own\r\nschool, and he was painfully aware that he had made many enemies in\r\nhigh places. Still, in spite of all forebodings, he continued his\r\nresearches in fresco-painting, and wrote vehement letters to the\r\npapers, protesting against the threatened employment of Cornelius and\r\nother German artists.\r\n\r\nDuring this year Haydon was working intermittently at two or three\r\nlarge pictures, 'Alexander conquering the Lion,' 'Curtius leaping into\r\nthe Gulf,' and the 'Siege of Saragossa,' for the days were long past\r\nwhen one grand composition occupied him for six years. That the wolf\r\nwas once again howling at the door is evidenced by the entry for\r\nFebruary 6. 'I got up yesterday, after lying awake for several hours\r\nwith all the old feelings of torture at want of money. A bill coming\r\ndue of £44 for my boy Frank at Caius. Three commissions for £700 put\r\noff till next year. My dear Mary's health broken up.... I knew if my\r\ndebt to the tutor of Caius was not paid, the mind of my son Frank\r\nwould be destroyed, from his sensitiveness to honour and right. As he\r\nis now beating third-year men, I dreaded any check.' In these straits\r\nhe hastily painted one or two small pot-boilers, borrowed, deferred,\r\npawned his wife's watch, and had the satisfaction of bringing his son\r\nhome 'crowned as first-prize man in mathematics.' For one who was in\r\nthe toils of the money-lenders, who was only living from hand to\r\nmouth, and who had never made an investment in his life, to give his\r\nson a university career, must be regarded, according to individual\r\nfeeling, either as a proof of presumptuous folly or of childlike trust\r\nin Providence.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his pictures were off his hands, Haydon began his\r\ncompetition cartoons of 'The Curse of Adam and Eve,' and 'The Entry of\r\nEdward the Black Prince and King John into London.' He felt that it\r\nwas beneath his dignity as a painter of recognised standing to compete\r\nwith young unknown men who had nothing to lose, but in his present\r\nnecessities the chance of winning one of the money prizes was not to\r\nbe neglected. In the absence of any lucrative employment he was only\r\nable to carry on his work by pawning his lay-figure, and borrowing off\r\nhis butterman. Small wonder that he exclaims: 'The greatest curse that\r\ncan befall a father in England is to have a son gifted with a passion\r\nand a genius for high art. Thank God with all my soul and all my\r\nnature, my children have witnessed the harrowing agonies under which I\r\nhave ever painted, and the very name of painting, the very thought of\r\na picture, gives them a hideous taste in their mouths. Thank God, not\r\none of my boys, nor my girl, can draw a straight line, even with a\r\nruler, much less without one.'\r\n\r\nIn the course of this year Haydon began a correspondence with Miss\r\nBarrett, afterwards Mrs. Browning, with whom he was never personally\r\nacquainted, though he knew her through her poems, and through the\r\nallusions to her in the letters of their common friend, Miss Mitford.\r\nThe paper friendship flourished for a time, and Haydon, who was a keen\r\njudge of character, recognised that here was a little Donna Quixote\r\nwhose chivalry could be depended on in time of trouble. More than\r\nonce, when threatened with arrest, he sent her paintings and\r\nmanuscripts, of which she took charge with sublime indifference to the\r\nfact that by so doing she might be placing herself within reach of the\r\narm of the law. One of the pictures that were placed in her\r\nguardianship was an unfinished portrait of 'Wordsworth musing upon\r\nHelvellyn.' Miss Barrett was inspired by this work with the sonnet\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n   'Wordsworth upon Helvellyn! Let the cloud\r\n   Ebb audibly along the mountain wind';\r\n\r\nand concluding with the fine tribute:\r\n\r\n                           'A vision free\r\n   And noble, Haydon, hath thine art released.\r\n   No portrait this with academic air,\r\n   This is the poet and his poetry.'\r\n\r\nThe year 1843 brought, as Haydon's biographer points out, 'the\r\nconsummation of what he had so earnestly fought for, a competition of\r\nnative artists to prove their capability for executing great\r\nmonumental and decorative works; but with this came his own bitter\r\ndisappointment at not being among the successful competitors. In all\r\nhis struggles up to this point, Haydon had the consolation of hope\r\nthat better times were coming. But now the good time for art was at\r\nhand, and he was passed over. The blow fell heavily--indeed, I may\r\nsay, was mortal. He tried to cheat himself into the belief that the\r\nold hostile influences to which he attributed all his misfortunes, had\r\nbeen working here also, and that he should yet rise superior to their\r\nmalice. He would not admit to himself that his powers were\r\nimpaired--that he was less fit for great achievements in his art than\r\nhe had been when he painted Solomon and Lazarus. But if he held this\r\nopinion, he held it alone. It was apparent to all, even to his warmest\r\nfriends, that years of harass, humiliation, distraction, and conflict\r\nhad enfeebled his energies, and led him to seek in exaggeration the\r\neffect he could no longer attain by well-measured force. His restless\r\ndesire to have a hand in all that was projected for art, had wearied\r\nthose in authority. He had shown himself too intractable to follow,\r\nand he had not inspired that confidence which might have given him a\r\nright to lead.'\r\n\r\nAlthough Haydon loudly proclaimed his conviction that, in face of the\r\nhostility against him, his cartoons would not be successful, even\r\nthough they were as perfect as Raphael's, yet it is obvious that he\r\nhad not altogether relinquished hope. In a letter to his old pupil,\r\nEastlake, who was secretary to the Fine Arts Commission, he says: 'I\r\nappeal to the Royal Commission, to the First Lord, to you the\r\nsecretary, to Barry the architect, if I ought not to be indulged in my\r\nhereditary right to do this, viz., that when the houses are ready,\r\ncartoons done, colours mixed, and all at their posts, I shall be\r\nallowed, _employed_ or _not employed_, to take the brush, and\r\ndip into the _first_ colour, and put the _first_ touch on the\r\n_first_ intonaco. If that is not granted, I'll haunt every noble\r\nLord and you, till you join my disturbed spirit on the banks of\r\nthe Styx.'\r\n\r\nOn June 1, Haydon placed his two cartoons in Westminster Hall, and\r\nthanked his God that he had lived to see that day, adding with\r\nunconscious blasphemy, 'Spare my life, O Lord, until I have shown thy\r\nstrength unto this generation, thy power unto that which is to come.'\r\nThe miracle for which he had secretly hoped, while declaring his\r\ncertainty of failure, did not happen. On June 27 he heard from\r\nEastlake that his cartoons were not among those chosen for reward.\r\nHalf stunned by the blow, anticipated though it had been, he makes but\r\nfew comments on the news in his Journal, and those are written in a\r\ncomposed and reasonable tone. 'I went to bed last night in a decent\r\nstate of anxiety,' he observes. 'It has given a great shock to my\r\nfamily, especially to my dear boy, Frank, and revived all the old\r\nhorrors of arrest, execution, and debt. It is exactly what I expected,\r\nand is, I think, intentional.... I am wounded, and being ill from\r\nconfinement, it shook me. (_July 1st_) A day of great misery. I\r\nsaid to my dear love, \"I am not included.\" Her expression was a study.\r\nShe said, \"We shall be ruined.\" I looked up my letters, papers, and\r\nJournals, and sent them to my dear AEschylus Barrett. I burnt loads of\r\nprivate letters, and prepared for executions. Seven pounds was raised\r\non my daughter's and Mary's dresses.'\r\n\r\nThe three money prizes were awarded to Armitage, Cope, and Watts, but\r\nit was announced that another competition, in fresco, would be held\r\nthe following year, when the successful competitors would be intrusted\r\nwith the decoration of the House of Lords. Haydon did not enter for\r\nthis competition, but, as will presently appear, he refused to allow\r\nthat he was beaten. On September 4 he removed his cartoons from\r\nWestminster Hall, with the comment: 'Thus ends the cartoon contest;\r\nand as the very first inventor and beginner of this mode of rousing\r\nthe people when they were pronounced incapable of relishing refined\r\nworks of art without colour, I am deeply wounded at the insult\r\ninflicted. These Journals witness under what trials I began them--how\r\nI called on my Creator for His blessing--how I trusted in Him, and how\r\nI have been degraded, insulted, and harassed. O Lord! Thou knowest\r\nbest. I submit.'\r\n\r\nDuring the year Haydon had finished his picture of 'Alexander and the\r\nLion,' which he considered one of his finest works, though the British\r\nGallery declined to hang it, and no patron offered to buy it. He had\r\nalso painted for bread and cheese innumerable small replicas of\r\n'Napoleon at St. Helena' and the 'Duke at Waterloo' for five guineas\r\napiece. By the beginning of 1844 his spirits had outwardly revived,\r\nthanks to the anodyne of incessant labour, and he writes almost in the\r\nold buoyant vein: 'Another day of work, God be thanked! Put in the sea\r\n[in \"Napoleon at St. Helena\"]; a delicious tint. How exquisite is a\r\nbare canvas, sized alone, to work on; how the slightest colour, thin\r\nas water, tells; how it glitters in body; how the brush flies--now\r\nhere--now there; it seems as if face, hands, sky, thought, poetry, and\r\nexpression were hid in the handle, and streamed out as it touched the\r\ncanvas. What magic! what fire! what unerring hand and eye! what power!\r\nwhat a gift of God! I bow, and am grateful.' On March 24 he came to\r\nthe fatal decision to paint his own original designs for the House of\r\nLords in a series of six large pictures, and exhibit them separately,\r\na decision founded, as he believed, on supernatural inspiration.\r\n'Awoke this morning,' he writes, 'with that sort of audible whisper\r\nSocrates, Columbus, and Tasso heard! \"Why do you not paint your own\r\ndesigns for the House on your own foundation, and exhibit them?\" I\r\nfelt as if there was no chance of my ever being permitted to do them\r\nelse, without control also. I knelt up in my bed, and prayed heartily\r\nto accomplish them, whatever might be the obstruction. I will begin\r\nthem as my next great works; I feel as if they will be my last, and I\r\nthink I shall then have done my duty. O God! bless the beginning,\r\nprogression, and conclusion of these six great designs to illustrate\r\nthe best government to regulate without cramping the energies of\r\nmankind.'\r\n\r\nIn July the frescoes sent in for competition were exhibited in\r\nWestminster Hall, and in the result six artists were commissioned to\r\ndecorate the House of Lords, Maclise, Redgrave, Dyce, Cope, Horsley,\r\nand Thomas. 'I see,' writes Haydon, 'they are resolved that I, the\r\noriginator of the whole scheme, shall have nothing to do with it; so I\r\nwill (trusting in the great God who has brought me thus far) begin on\r\nmy own inventions without employment.' The first of the series was\r\n'Aristides hooted by the Populace,' and the conditions under which it\r\nwas painted are described in his annual review of the year's work: 'I\r\nhave painted a large Napoleon in four days and a half, six smaller\r\ndifferent subjects, three Curtiuses, five Napoleons Musing, three\r\nDukes and Copenhagens, George IV., and the Duke at Waterloo--half done\r\nUriel--published my lectures--and settled composition of Aristides. I\r\ngave lectures at Liverpool, sometimes twice a day, and lectured at the\r\nRoyal Institution. I have not been idle, but how much more I might\r\nhave done!'\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Haydon exhibited his picture of 'Uriel and Satan' at the\r\nAcademy, and 'after twenty-two years of abuse,' actually received a\r\nfavourable notice in the _Times_, For the Uriel he was paid £200,\r\nbut five other pictures remained upon his hands, their estimated value\r\namounting to nearly a thousand pounds, and he was left to work at his\r\n_Aristides_ with barely ten shillings for current expenses, and\r\nnot a single commission in prospect. 'What a pity it is,' he observes,\r\n'that a man of my order--sincerity, perhaps genius [in the Journal a\r\nprivate note is here inserted, \"not _perhaps_\"], is not employed.\r\nWhat honour, what distinction would I not confer on my great country!\r\nHowever, it is my destiny to perform great things, not in consequence\r\nof encouragement, but in spite of opposition, and so let it be.' In\r\nthe latter part of the year came one or two minor pieces of good\r\nfortune for which Haydon professed the profoundest gratitude,\r\ndeclaring that he was not good enough to deserve such blessings. The\r\nKing of Hanover bought a Napoleon for £200, and a pupil came, who paid\r\na like sum as premium. His son, Frank, who had taken his degree,\r\nchanged his mind again about his profession, and now 'shrank from the\r\npublicity of the pulpit.' Haydon applied to Sir Robert Peel for an\r\nappointment for the youth, and Peel, who seems to have shown the\r\nutmost patience and kindness in his relations with the unfortunate\r\nartist, at once offered a post in the Record Office at £80 a year, an\r\noffer which was gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nThus relieved of immediate care, Haydon set to work on the second\r\npicture of his series, 'Nero playing the Lyre while Rome was burning.'\r\nThe effect of his conception, as he foresaw it in his mind's eye, was\r\nso terrific that he 'fluttered, trembled, and perspired like a woman,\r\nand was obliged to sit down.' Under all the anxiety, the pressure, and\r\nthe disappointment of Haydon's life, it must be remembered that there\r\nwere enormous compensations in the shape of days and hours of absorbed\r\nand satisfied employment, days and hours such as seldom fall to the\r\nlot of the average good citizen and solvent householder. The following\r\nentry alone is sufficient proof that Haydon, even in his worst\r\nstraits, was almost as much an object of envy as of compassion:\r\n'Worked with such intense abstraction and delight for eight hours,\r\nwith five minutes only for lunch, that though living in the noisiest\r\nquarter of all London, I never remember hearing all day a single cart,\r\ncarriage, knock, cry, bark of man, woman, dog, or child. When I came\r\nout into the sunshine I said to myself, \"Why, what is all this driving\r\nabout?\" though it has always been so for the last twenty-two years, so\r\nperfectly, delightfully, and intensely had I been abstracted. If that\r\nbe not happiness, what is?'\r\n\r\nHaydon had now staked all his hopes upon the exhibition in the spring\r\nof 1846 of the first two pictures in his series, 'Aristides' and\r\n'Nero.' If the public flocked to see them, if it accorded him, as he\r\nexpected, its enthusiastic support, he hoped that the Commission would\r\nbe shamed into offering him public employment. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe exhibition failed, he must have realised that he would be\r\nirretrievably ruined, with all his hopes for the future slain.\r\nEverything was to be sacrificed to this last grand effort. 'If I lose\r\nthis moment for showing all my works,' he writes, 'it can never occur\r\nagain. My fate hangs on doing as I ought, and seizing moments with\r\nenergy. I shall never again have the opportunity of connecting myself\r\nwith a great public commission by opposition, and interesting the\r\npublic by the contrast. If I miss it, it will be a tide not taken at\r\nthe flood.'\r\n\r\nBy dint of begging and borrowing, the money was scraped together for\r\nthe opening expenses of the exhibition, and Haydon composed a\r\nsensational descriptive advertisement in the hope of attracting the\r\npublic. The private view was on April 4, when it rained all day, and\r\nonly four old friends attended. On April 6, Easter Monday, the public\r\nwas admitted, but only twenty-one availed themselves of the privilege.\r\nFor a few days Haydon went on hoping against hope that matters would\r\nimprove, and that John Bull, in whose support he had trusted, would\r\nrally round him at last. But Tom Thumb was exhibiting next door, and\r\nthe historical painter had no chance against the pigmy. The people\r\nrushed by in their thousands to visit Tom Thumb, but few stopped to\r\ninspect 'Aristides' or 'Nero.' 'They push, they fight, they scream,\r\nthey faint,' writes Haydon, 'they see my bills, my boards, my\r\ncaravans, and don't read them. Their eyes are open, but their sense is\r\nshut. It is an insanity, a rabies, a madness, a furor, a dream. Tom\r\nThumb had 12,000 people last week, B. R. Haydon 133 1/2 (the half a\r\nlittle girl). Exquisite taste of the English people!... (_May,_\r\n18_th_) I closed my exhibition this day, and lost £111, 8s. 10d.\r\nNo man can accuse me of showing less energy, less spirit, less genius\r\nthan I did twenty-six years ago. I have not decayed, but the people\r\nhave been corrupted. I am the same, they are not; and I have suffered\r\nin consequence.'\r\n\r\nIn defiance of this shipwreck of all his hopes, and the heavy\r\nliabilities that hung about his neck, this indomitable spirit began\r\nthe third picture of his unappreciated series, 'Alfred and the First\r\nBritish Jury.' He had large sums to pay in the coming month, and only\r\na few shillings in the house, with no commissions in prospect. He\r\nsends up passionate and despairing petitions that God will help him in\r\nhis dreadful necessities, will raise him friends from sources\r\ninvisible, and enable him to finish his last and greatest works.\r\nAppeals for help to Lord Brougham, the Duke of Beaufort, and Sir\r\nRobert Peel brought only one response, a cheque for £50 from Peel,\r\nwhich was merely a drop in the ocean. Day by day went by, and still no\r\ncommissions came in, no offers for any of the large pictures he had on\r\nhand. Haydon began to lose confidence in his ability to finish his\r\nseries, and with him loss of self-confidence was a fatal sign. The\r\nJune weather was hot, he was out of health, and unable to sleep at\r\nnight, but he declined to send for a doctor. His brain grew confused,\r\nand at last even the power to work, that power which for him had spelt\r\npride and happiness throughout his whole life, seemed to be leaving\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn June 16 he writes: 'I sat from two till five staring at my picture\r\nlike an idiot, my brain pressed down by anxiety, and the anxious looks\r\nof my dear Mary and the children.... Dearest Mary, with a woman's\r\npassion, wishes me at once to stop payment, and close the whole thing.\r\nI will not. I will finish my six under the blessing of God, reduce my\r\nexpenses, and hope His mercy will not desert me, but bring me through\r\nin health and vigour, gratitude and grandeur of soul, to the end.' The\r\nend was nearer than he thought, for even Haydon's brave spirit could\r\nnot battle for ever with adverse fate, and the collapse, when it came,\r\nwas sudden. The last two or three entries in the Journal are\r\nmelancholy reading.\r\n\r\n'_June_ 18.--O God, bless me through the evils of this day. My\r\nlandlord, Newton, called. I said, \"I see a quarter's rent in thy face,\r\nbut none from me.\" I appointed to-morrow night to see him, and lay\r\nbefore him every iota of my position. Good-hearted Newton! I said,\r\n\"Don't put in an execution.\" \"Nothing of the sort,\" he replied, half\r\nhurt. I sent the Duke, Wordsworth, dear Fred and Mary's heads to Miss\r\nBarrett to protect. I have the Duke's boots and hat, Lord Grey's coat,\r\nand some more heads.\r\n\r\n'20_th_.--O God, bless us through all the evils of this day.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n'21_st,_.--Slept horribly. Prayed in sorrow, and got up in\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n'22_nd_.--God forgive me. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS OF B. R. HAYDON.\r\n\r\n '\"Stretch me no longer on this rough world\"--_Lear_.'\r\n\r\nThis last entry was made between ten and eleven o'clock on the morning\r\nof June 22. Haydon had risen early, and gone out to a gunmaker's in\r\nOxford Street, where he bought a pair of pistols. After breakfast, he\r\nasked his wife to go and spend the day with an old friend, and having\r\naffectionately embraced her, shut himself in his painting-room. Mrs.\r\nHaydon left the house, and an hour later Miss Haydon went down to the\r\nstudio, intending to try and console her father in his anxieties. She\r\nfound him stretched on the floor in front of his unfinished picture of\r\n'Alfred and the First Jury,' a bullet-wound in his head, and a\r\nfrightful gash across his throat. A razor and a small pistol lay by\r\nhis side. On the table were his Journal, open at the last page,\r\nletters to his wife and children, his will, made that morning, and a\r\npaper headed: 'Last thoughts of B. R. Haydon; half-past ten.' These\r\nfew lines, with their allusions to Wellington and Napoleon, are\r\ncharacteristic of the man who had painted the two great soldiers a\r\nscore of times, and looked up to them as his heroes and exemplars.\r\n\r\n'No man should use certain evil for probable good, however great the\r\nobject,' so they run. 'Evil is the prerogative of the Deity.\r\nWellington never used evil if the good was not certain. Napoleon had\r\nno such scruples, and I fear the glitter of his genius rather dazzled\r\nme. But had I been encouraged, nothing but good would have come from\r\nme, because when encouraged I paid everybody. God forgive me the evil\r\nfor the sake of the good. Amen.'\r\n\r\nThis tragic conclusion to a still more tragic career created a\r\nprofound sensation in society, and immense crowds followed the\r\nhistorical painter to his grave. Among all his friends, perhaps few\r\nwere more affected by his death than one who had never looked upon his\r\nface--his 'dear Æschylus Barrett, 'as he called her. Certain it is\r\nthat, with the intuition of genius, Elizabeth Barrett understood,\r\nappreciated, and made allowances for the unhappy man more completely\r\nthan was possible to any other of his contemporaries. Clear-sighted to\r\nhis faults and weaknesses, her chivalrous spirit took up arms in\r\ndefence of his conduct, even against the strictures of her poet-lover.\r\n'The dreadful death of poor Mr. Haydon the artist,' she wrote to her\r\nfriend Mrs. Martin, a few days after the event, 'has quite upset me. I\r\nthank God that I never saw him--poor gifted Haydon.... No artist is\r\nleft behind with equal largeness of poetical conception. If the hand\r\nhad always obeyed the soul, he would have been a genius of the first\r\norder. As it is, he lived on the slope of genius, and could not be\r\nsteadfast and calm. His life was one long agony of self-assertion.\r\nPoor, poor Haydon! See how the world treats those who try too openly\r\nfor its gratitude. \"Tom Thumb for ever\" over the heads of its giants.'\r\n\r\n'Could any one--_could my own hand even have averted what has\r\nhappened_?' she wrote to Robert Browning on June 24, 1846. 'My head\r\nand heart have ached to-day over the inactive hand. But for the moment\r\nit was out of my power, and then I never fancied this case to be more\r\nthan a piece of a continuous case, of a habit fixed. Two years ago he\r\nsent me boxes and pictures precisely so, and took them back\r\nagain--poor, poor Haydon!--as he will not this time.... Also, I have\r\nbeen told again and again (oh, never by _you_, my beloved) that\r\nto give money _there_, was to drop it into a hole in the ground.\r\nBut if to have dropped it so, dust to dust, would have saved a living\r\nman--what then?... Some day, when I have the heart to look for it, you\r\nshall see his last note. I understand now that there are touches of\r\ndesperate pathos--but never could he have meditated self-destruction\r\nwhile writing that note. He said he should write six more\r\nlectures--six more volumes. He said he was painting a new background\r\nto a picture which made him feel as if his soul had wings... and he\r\nrepeated an old phrase of his, which I had heard from him often\r\nbefore, and which now rings hollowly to the ears of my memory--that he\r\n_couldn't and wouldn't die_. Strange and dreadful!'\r\n\r\nDirectly after Haydon's death a public meeting of his friends and\r\npatrons was held, at which a considerable sum was subscribed for the\r\nbenefit of his widow and daughter. Sir Robert Peel, besides sending\r\nimmediate help, recommended the Queen to bestow a small pension on\r\nMrs. Haydon. The dead man's debts amounted to £3000, and his assets\r\nconsisted chiefly of unsaleable pictures, on most of which his\r\ncreditors had liens. In his will was a clause to the effect that 'I\r\nhave manuscripts and memoirs in the possession of Miss Barrett, of 50\r\nWimpole Street, in a chest, which I wish Longman to be consulted\r\nabout. My memoirs are to 1820; my journals will supply the rest. The\r\nstyle, the individuality of Richardson, which I wish not curtailed by\r\nan editor.' Miss Mitford was asked to edit the Life, but felt herself\r\nunequal to the task, which was finally intrusted to Mr. Tom Taylor.\r\n\r\nHaydon's _Memoirs_, compiled from his autobiography, journals,\r\nand correspondence, appeared in 1853, the same year that saw the\r\npublication of Lord John Russell's _Life of Thomas Moore_. To the\r\ngreat astonishment of both critics and public, Haydon's story proved\r\nthe more interesting of the two. 'Haydon's book is the work of the\r\nyear,' writes Miss Mitford. 'It has entirely stopped the sale of\r\nMoore's, which really might have been written by a Court newspaper or\r\na Court milliner.' Again, the _Athenæum_, a more impartial\r\nwitness, asks, 'Who would have thought that the Life of Haydon would\r\nturn out a more sterling and interesting addition to English biography\r\nthan the Life of Moore?' But the highest testimony to the merits of\r\nthe book as a human document comes from Mrs. Browning, who wrote to\r\nMiss Mitford on March 19, 1854, 'Oh, I have just been reading poor\r\nHaydon's biography. There is tragedy! The pain of it one can hardly\r\nshake off. Surely, surely, wrong was done somewhere, when the worst is\r\nadmitted of Haydon. For himself, looking forward beyond the grave, I\r\nseem to understand that all things, when most bitter, worked ultimate\r\ngood to him, for that sublime arrogance of his would have been fatal\r\nperhaps to the moral nature, if further developed by success. But for\r\nthe nation we had our duties, and we should not suffer our teachers\r\nand originators to sink thus. It is a book written in blood of the\r\nheart. Poor Haydon!' Mr. Taylor's Life was supplemented in 1874 by\r\nHaydon's _Correspondence and Table-talk_, together with a\r\n_Memoir_ written in a tone of querulous complaint, by his second\r\nson, Frederick, who, it may be noted, had been dismissed from the\r\npublic service for publishing a letter to Mr. Gladstone, entitled\r\n_Our Officials at the Home Office_, and who died in the Bethlehem\r\nHospital in 1886. His elder brother, Frank, committed suicide in 1887.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Haydon's merits as a painter the opinion of his\r\ncontemporaries swung from one extreme to another, while that of\r\nposterity perhaps has scarcely allowed him such credit as was his due.\r\nIt is certain that he was considered a youth of extraordinary promise\r\nby his colleagues, Wilkie, Jackson, and Sir George Beaumont, yet there\r\nwere not wanting critics who declared that his early picture,\r\n'Dentatus,' was an absurd mass of vulgarity and distortion. Foreign\r\nartists who visited his studio urged him to go to Rome, where he was\r\nassured that patrons and pupils would flock round him; while, on the\r\nother hand, he was described by a native critic (in the _Quarterly\r\nReview_) as one of the most defective painters of the day, who had\r\nreceived more pecuniary assistance, more indulgence, more liberality,\r\nand more charity than any other artist ever heard of. But the best\r\ncriticism of his powers, though it scarcely takes into account the\r\ngift of imagination which received so many tributes from the poets, is\r\nthat contributed to Mr. Taylor's biography by Mr. Watts, R.A.\r\n\r\n'The characteristics of Haydon's art,' he writes, 'appear to me to be\r\ngreat determination and power, knowledge, and effrontery... Haydon\r\nappears to have succeeded as often as he displays any real anxiety to\r\ndo so; but one is struck with the extraordinary discrepancy of\r\ndifferent parts of the work, as though, bored by a fixed attention\r\nthat had taken him out of himself, yet highly applauding the result,\r\nhe had scrawled and daubed his brush about in a sort of intoxication\r\nof self-glory... In Haydon's work there is not sufficient\r\nforgetfulness of self to disarm criticism of personality. His pictures\r\nare themselves autobiographical notes of the most interesting kind;\r\nbut their want of beauty repels, and their want of modesty\r\nexasperates. Perhaps their principal characteristic is lack of\r\ndelicacy and refinement of execution.' While describing Haydon's touch\r\nas woolly, his surfaces as disagreeable, and his draperies as\r\ndeficient in dignity, Mr. Watts admits that his expression of anatomy\r\nand general perception of form are the best by far that can be found\r\nin the English school. Haydon had looked forward in full confidence to\r\nthe favourable verdict of posterity, and to an honourable position in\r\nthe National Gallery for the big canvases that had been neglected by\r\nhis contemporaries. It is not the least of life's little ironies that\r\nwhile not a single work of his now hangs in the National Gallery, his\r\nlarge picture of Curtius leaping into the Gulf occupies a prominent\r\nposition in one of Gatti's restaurants. [Footnote: Three of Haydon's\r\npictures, however, are the property of the nation. Two, the 'Lazarus'\r\nand 'May-day,' belong to the National Gallery, but have been lent to\r\nprovincial galleries. One, the 'Christ in the Garden,' belongs to the\r\nSouth Kensington Museum, but has been stored away.]\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer, a theoriser, and a populariser of his art, Haydon has\r\njust claims to grateful remembrance. Though driven to paint\r\npot-boilers for the support of his family, he never ceased to preach\r\nthe gospel of high art; he was among the first to recognise and\r\nacclaim the transcendent merits of the Elgin Marbles; he rejoiced with\r\na personal joy in the purchase of the Angerstein collection as the\r\nnucleus of a National Gallery; he scorned the ignoble fears of some of\r\nhis colleagues lest the newly-started winter exhibitions of old\r\nmasters should injure their professional prospects; he used his\r\ninterest at Court to have Raphael's cartoons brought up to London for\r\nthe benefit of students and public; he advocated the establishment of\r\nlocal schools of design, and, through his lectures and writings,\r\nhelped to raise and educate the taste of his country.\r\n\r\nHaydon has painted his own character and temperament in such vivid\r\ncolours, that scarcely a touch need be added to the portrait. He was\r\nan original thinker, a vigorous writer, a keen observer, but from his\r\nyouth up a disproportion was evident in the structure of his mind,\r\nthat pointed only too clearly to insanity. His judgment, as Mr. Taylor\r\nobserves, was essentially unsound in all matters where he himself was\r\npersonally interested. His vanity blinded him throughout to the\r\nquality of his own work, the amount of influence he could wield, and\r\nthe extent of the public sympathy that he excited. He was essentially\r\nreligious in temperament, though his religion was so assertive and\r\negotistical in type that those who hold with Rosalba that where there\r\nis no modesty there can be no religion, [Footnote: Rosalba said of Sir\r\nGodfrey Kneller, 'This man can have no religion, for he has no\r\nmodesty.'] might be inclined to deny its existence. From the very\r\noutset of his career Haydon took up the attitude of a missionary of\r\nhigh art in England--and therewith the expectation of being crowned\r\nand enriched as its Priest and King. He clung to the belief that a man\r\nwho devoted himself to the practice of a high and ennobling art ought\r\nto be supported by a grateful country, or at least by generous\r\npatrons, and he could never be made to realise that Art is a stern and\r\njealous mistress, who demands material sacrifices from her votaries in\r\nexchange for spiritual compensations. If a man desires to create a new\r\nera in the art of his country, he must be prepared to lead a monastic\r\nlife in a garret; but if, like Haydon, he allows himself a wife and\r\neight children, and professes to be unable to live on five hundred a\r\nyear, he must condescend to the painting of portraits and pot-boilers.\r\nThe public cannot be forced to support what it neither understands nor\r\nadmires, and, in a democratic state, the Government is bound to\r\nconsult the taste of its masters.\r\n\r\nHaydon's financial embarrassments were perhaps the least of his\r\ntrials. As has been seen, he had fallen into the hands of the\r\nmoney-lenders in early youth, and he had never been able to extricate\r\nhimself from their clutches. But so many of his friends and\r\ncolleagues--Godwin, Leigh Hunt, and Sir Thomas Lawrence among\r\nothers--were in the same position, that Haydon must have felt he was\r\ninsolvent in excellent company. As long as he was able to keep himself\r\nout of prison and the bailiffs out of his house, he seems to have\r\nconsidered that his affairs were positively nourishing, and at their\r\nworst his financial difficulties alone would never have driven him to\r\nself-destruction. Mrs. Browning was surely right when she wrote:--'The\r\nmore I think the more I am inclined to conclude that the money\r\nirritation was merely an additional irritation, and that the despair,\r\nleading to revolt against life, had its root in disappointed ambition.\r\nThe world did not recognise his genius, and he punished the world by\r\nwithdrawing the light... All the audacity and bravery and\r\nself-calculation, which drew on him so much ridicule, were an agony in\r\ndisguise--he could not live without reputation, and he wrestled for\r\nit, struggled for it, _kicked_ for it, forgetting grace of\r\nattitude in the pang. When all was vain he went mad and died... Poor\r\nHaydon! Think what an agony life was to him, so constituted!--his own\r\ngenius a clinging curse! the fire and the clay in him seething and\r\nquenching one another!--the man seeing maniacally in all men the\r\nassassins of his fame! and with the whole world against him,\r\nstruggling for the thing that was his life, through day and night, in\r\nthoughts and in dreams ... struggling, stifling, breaking the hearts\r\nof the creatures dearest to him, in the conflict for which there was\r\nno victory, though he could not choose but fight it. Tell me if\r\nLaocoön's anguish was not as an infant's sleep compared to this.'\r\n\r\nHaydon wrote his own epitaph, and this, which he, at least, believed\r\nto be an accurate summary of his misfortunes and their cause, may\r\nfitly close this brief outline of his troubled life:--\r\n\r\n'HERE LIETH THE BODY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON,\r\n\r\nAn English Historical Painter, who, in a struggle to make the People,\r\nthe Legislature, the Nobility, and the Sovereign of England give due\r\ndignity and rank to the highest Art, which has ever languished, and,\r\nuntil the Government interferes, ever will languish in England, fell a\r\nVictim to his ardour and his love of country, an evidence that to seek\r\nthe benefit of your country by telling the Truth to Power, is a crime\r\nthat can only be expiated by the ruin and destruction of the Man who\r\nis so patriotic and so imprudent.\r\n\r\n'He was born at Plymouth, 26th of January 1786, and died on the [22nd\r\nof June] 18[46], believing in Christ as the Mediator and Advocate of\r\nMankind:--\r\n\r\n'\"What various ills the Painter's life assail, Pride, Envy, Want, the\r\nPatron and the Jail.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY MORGAN (SYDNEY OWENSON)\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sydney Owenson, afterwards Lady Morgan, From a drawing\r\nby Sir Thomas Lawrence.]\r\n\r\n'What,' asks Lady Morgan in her fragment of autobiography, 'what has a\r\nwoman to do with dates? Cold, false, erroneous dates! Her poetical\r\nidiosyncrasy, calculated by epochs, would make the most natural points\r\nof reference in a woman's autobiography.' The matter-of-fact Saxon\r\nwould hardly know how to set about calculating a poetical idiosyncrasy\r\nby epochs, but our Celtic heroine was equal to the task; at any rate,\r\nshe abstained so carefully throughout her career from all unnecessary\r\nallusion to what she called 'vulgar eras,' that the date of her birth\r\nremained a secret, even from her bitterest enemies. Her untiring\r\npersecutor, John Wilson Croker, declared that Sydney Owenson was born\r\nin 1775, while the _Dictionary of National Biography_ more\r\ngallantly gives the date as 1783, with a query. But as Sir Charles\r\nMorgan was born in the latter year, and as his wife owned to a few\r\nyears' seniority, we shall probably be doing her no injustice if we\r\nplace the important event between 1778 and 1780.\r\n\r\nLady Morgan's detestation for dates was accompanied by a vivid\r\nimagination, an inaccurate memory, and a constitutional inability to\r\ndeal with hard facts. Hence, her biographers have found it no easy\r\ntask to grapple with the details of her career, her own picturesque,\r\nhigh-coloured narrative being not invariably in accord with the\r\nprosaic records gathered from contemporary sources. For example,\r\naccording to the plain, unvarnished statement of a Saxon chronicler,\r\nLady Morgan's father was one Robert MacOwen, who was born in 1744, the\r\nson of poor parents in Connaught. He was educated at a hedge-school,\r\nand on coming to man's estate, obtained a situation as steward to a\r\nneighbouring landowner. But, having been inspired with an unquenchable\r\npassion for the theatre, he presently threw up his post, and through\r\nthe influence of Goldsmith, a 'Connaught cousin,' he obtained a\r\nfooting on the English stage.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic version of this story, as dictated by Lady Morgan in her\r\nold age, is immeasurably superior, and at any rate deserves to be\r\ntrue. Early in the eighteenth century, so runs the tale, a\r\nhurling-match was held in Connaught, which was attended by all the\r\ngentry of the neighbourhood. The Queen of Beauty, who gave away the\r\nprizes, was Sydney Crofton Bell, granddaughter of Sir Malby Crofton of\r\nLongford House. The victor of the hurling-match was Walter MacOwen, a\r\ngentleman according to the genealogy of Connaught, but a farmer by\r\nposition. Young, strong, and handsome, MacOwen, like Orlando,\r\noverthrew more than his enemies, with the result that presently there\r\nwas an elopement in the neighbourhood, and an unpardonable\r\n_mésalliance_ in the Crofton family. The marriage does not appear\r\nto have been a very happy one, since MacOwen continued to frequent all\r\nthe fairs and hurling-matches of the country-side, but his wife\r\nconsoled herself for his neglect by cultivating her musical and\r\npoetical gifts. She composed Irish songs and melodies, and gained the\r\ntitle of Clasagh-na-Vallagh, or Harp of the Valley. Her only son\r\nRobert inherited his father's good looks and his mother's artistic\r\ntalents, and was educated by the joint efforts of the Protestant\r\nclergyman and the Roman Catholic priest.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was about seventeen, a rich, eccentric stranger named\r\nBlake arrived to take possession of the Castle of Ardfry. The\r\nnew-comer, who was a musical amateur, presently discovered that there\r\nwas a young genius in the neighbourhood. Struck by the beauty of\r\nRobert MacOwen's voice, Mr. Blake offered to take the youth into his\r\nown household, and educate him for a liberal profession, an offer that\r\nwas joyfully accepted by Clasagh-na-Vallagh. The patron soon tired of\r\nConnaught, and carried off his _protégé_ to London, where he\r\nplaced him under Dr. Worgan, the famous blind organist of Westminster\r\nAbbey. At home, young MacOwen's duties were to keep his employer's\r\naccounts, to carve at table, and to sing Irish melodies to his guests.\r\nHe was taken up by his distant kinsman, Goldsmith, who introduced him\r\nto the world behind the scenes, and encouraged him in his aspirations\r\nafter a theatrical career.\r\n\r\nAmong the young Irishman's new acquaintances was Madame\r\nWeichsel, _prima donna_ of His Majesty's Theatre, and mother of\r\nthe more celebrated Mrs. Billington. The lady occasionally studied her\r\nroles under Dr. Worgan, when MacOwen played the part of stage-lover,\r\nand, being of an inflammable disposition, speedily developed into a\r\nreal one. This love-affair was the cause of a sudden reverse of\r\nfortune. During Mr. Blake's absence from town, Robert accompanied\r\nMadame Weichsel to Vauxhall, where she was engaged to sing a duet. Her\r\nprofessional colleague failing to appear, young MacOwen was persuaded\r\nto undertake the tenor part, which he did with pronounced success. But\r\nunfortunately Mr. Blake, who had returned unexpectedly from Ireland,\r\nwas among the audience, and was angered beyond all forgiveness by this\r\npremature _début_. When Robert went home, he found his trunks\r\nready packed, and a letter of dismissal from his patron awaiting him.\r\nA note for £300, which accompanied the letter, was returned, and the\r\nprodigal drove off to his cousin Goldsmith, who, with characteristic\r\ngood-nature, took him in, and promised him his interest with the\r\ntheatrical managers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lady Morgan's account, Robert Owenson, as he now called\r\nhimself in deference to the prevailing prejudice against both the\r\nIrish and the Scotch, was at once introduced to Garrick, and\r\nallowed to make his _début_ in the part of Tamerlane. But, from\r\ncontemporary evidence, it is clear that he had gained some experience\r\nin the provinces before he made his first appearance on the London\r\nboards, when his Tamerlane was a decided failure. Garrick refused to\r\nallow him a second chance, but after further provincial touring, he\r\nobtained another London engagement, and appeared with success in such\r\nparts as Captain Macheath, Sir Lucius O'Trigger, and Major O'Flaherty.\r\n\r\nOwenson had been on the stage some years when he fell in love with\r\nMiss Jane Hill, the daughter of a respectable burgess of Shrewsbury.\r\nThe worthy Mr. Hill refused his consent to his daughter's marriage\r\nwith an actor, but the dashing _jeune premier_, like his father\r\nbefore him, carried off his bride by night, and married her at\r\nLichfield before her irate parent could overtake them. Miss Hill was a\r\nMethodist by persuasion, and hated the theatre, though she loved her\r\nplayer. She induced her husband to renounce his profession for a time,\r\nand to appear only at concerts and oratorios. But the stage-fever was\r\nin his blood, and after a short retirement, we find him, in 1771,\r\ninvesting a part of his wife's fortune in a share in the Crow Street\r\nTheatre, Dublin, where he made his first appearance with great success\r\nin his favourite part of Major O'Flaherty, one of the characters in\r\nCumberland's comedy, _The West Indian_. He remained one of the\r\npillars of this theatre until 1782, when Ryder, the patentee, became a\r\nbankrupt. Owenson was then engaged by Richard Daly to perform at the\r\nSmock Alley Theatre, and also to fill the post of assistant-manager.\r\n\r\nBy this time Sydney had made her appearance in the world, arriving on\r\nChristmas Day in some unspecified year. According to one authority she\r\nwas born on ship-board during the passage from Holyhead to Dublin, but\r\nshe tells us herself that she was born at her father's house in Dublin\r\nduring a Christmas banquet, at which most of the leading wits and\r\nliterary celebrities of the capital were present. The whole party was\r\nbidden to her christening a month later, and Edward Lysaght, equally\r\nfamous as a lawyer and an improvisatore, undertook to make the\r\nnecessary vows in her name. In spite of this brilliant send-off,\r\nSydney was not destined to bring good fortune to her father's house. A\r\nfew years after her birth Owenson, having quarrelled with Daly,\r\ninvested his savings in a tumble-down building known as the Old Music\r\nHall, which he restored, and re-named the National Theatre. The season\r\nopened with a grand national performance, and everything promised\r\nwell, when, like a bomb-shell, came the announcement that the\r\nGovernment had granted to Richard Daly an exclusive patent for the\r\nperformance of legitimate drama in Dublin. Mr. Owenson was thus\r\nobliged to close his theatre at the end of his first season, but he\r\nreceived some compensation for his losses, and was offered a\r\nre-engagement under Daly on favourable terms, an offer which he had\r\nthe sense to accept.\r\n\r\nA short period of comparative calm and freedom from embarrassment now\r\nset in for the Owenson family. Mrs. Owenson was a careful mother, and\r\nextremely anxious about the education of her two little girls, Sydney\r\nand Olivia. There is a touch of pathos in the picture of the prim,\r\nmethodistical English lady, who hated the dirt and slovenliness of her\r\nhusband's people, was shocked at their jovial ways and free talk,\r\nlooked upon all Papists as connections of Antichrist, and hoped for\r\nthe salvation of mankind through the form of religion patronised by\r\nLady Huntington. She was accustomed to hold up as an example to her\r\nlittle girls the career of a certain model child, the daughter of a\r\ndistant kinsman, Sir Rowland Hill of Shropshire. This appalling infant\r\nhad read the Bible twice through before she was five, and knitted all\r\nthe stockings worn by her father's coachman. The lively Sydney\r\ndetested the memory of her virtuous young kinswoman, for she had great\r\ndifficulty in mastering the art of reading, though she learned easily\r\nby heart, and could imitate almost anything she saw. At a very early\r\nage she could go through the whole elaborate process of hair-dressing,\r\nfrom the first papillote to the last puff of the powder-machine, and\r\namused herself by arranging her father's old wigs in one of the\r\nwindows, under the inscription, 'Sydney Owenson, System, Tête, and\r\nPeruke Maker.'\r\n\r\nMr. Owenson found his friends among all the wildest wits of Dublin,\r\nbut his wife's society was strictly limited, both at the Old Music\r\nHall, part of which had been utilised as a dwelling, and at the\r\ncountry villa that her husband had taken for her at Drumcondra. Yet\r\nshe does not appear to have permitted her religious prejudices to\r\ninterfere with her social relaxations, since her three chief intimates\r\nat this time were the Rev. Charles Macklin (nephew of the actor), a\r\ngreat performer on the Irish pipes, who had been dismissed from his\r\ncuracy for playing out the congregation on his favourite instrument; a\r\nMethodist preacher who had come over on one of Lady Huntingdon's\r\nmissions; and a Jesuit priest, who, his order being proscribed in\r\nIreland, was living in concealment, and in want, it was believed, of\r\nthe necessaries of life. These three regularly frequented the Old\r\nMusic Hall, where points of faith were freely discussed, Mrs. Owenson\r\nholding the position of Protestant Pope in the little circle. In order\r\nthat the discussions might not be unprofitable, the Catholic servants\r\nwere sometimes permitted to stand at the door, and gather up the\r\ncrumbs of theological wisdom.\r\n\r\nFemale visitors were few, one of the most regular being a younger\r\nsister of Oliver Goldsmith, who lived with a grocer brother in a\r\nlittle shop which was afterwards occupied by the father of Thomas\r\nMoore. Miss Goldsmith was a plain, little old lady, who always carried\r\na long tin case, containing a rouleaux of Dr. Goldsmith's portraits,\r\nwhich she offered for sale. Sydney much preferred her father's\r\nfriends, more especially his musical associates, such as Giordani the\r\ncomposer, and Fisher the violinist, who spent most of their time at\r\nhis house during their visits to Dublin. The children used to hide\r\nunder the table to hear them make music, and picked up many melodies\r\nby ear. When Mr. Owenson was asked why he did not cultivate his\r\ndaughter's talent, he replied, 'If I were to cultivate their talent\r\nfor music, it might induce them some day to go upon the stage, and I\r\nwould rather buy them a sieve of black cockles to cry about the\r\nstreets of Dublin than see them the first _prima donnas_ of\r\nEurope.'\r\n\r\nThe little Owensons possessed one remarkable playfellow in the shape\r\nof Thomas Dermody, the 'wonderful boy,' who was regarded in Dublin as\r\na second Chatterton. A poor scholar, the son of a drunken country\r\nschoolmaster, who turned him adrift at fourteen, Dermody had wandered\r\nup to Dublin, paying his way by reciting poetry and telling stories to\r\nhis humble entertainers, with a few tattered books, one shirt, and two\r\nshillings for all his worldly goods. He first found employment as\r\n'librarian' at a cobbler's stall, on which a few cheap books were\r\nexposed for sale. Later, he got employment as assistant to the\r\nscene-painter at the Theatre Royal, and here he wrote a clever poem on\r\nthe leading performers, which found its way into the green-room.\r\nAnxious to see the author, the company, Owenson amongst them, invaded\r\nthe painting-room, where they found the boy-poet, clad in rags, his\r\nhair clotted with glue, his face smeared with paint, a pot of size in\r\none hand and a brush in the other. The sympathy of the kind-hearted\r\nplayers was aroused, and it was decided that something must be done\r\nfor youthful genius in distress. Owenson invited the boy to his house,\r\nand, by way of testing his powers, set him to write a poetical theme\r\non the subject of Dublin University. In less than three-quarters of an\r\nhour the prodigy returned with a poem of fifty lines, which showed an\r\nintimate acquaintance with the history of the university from its\r\nfoundation. A second test having been followed by equally satisfactory\r\nresults, it was decided that a sum of money should be raised by\r\nsubscriptions, and that Dermody should be assisted to enter the\r\nuniversity. Owenson, with his wife's cordial consent, took the young\r\npoet into his house, and treated him like his own son. Unfortunately,\r\nDermody's genius was weighted by the artistic temperament; he was\r\nlazy, irregular in his attendance at college, and not particularly\r\ngrateful to his benefactors. By his own acts he fell out of favour,\r\nthe subscriptions that had been collected were returned to the donors,\r\nand his career would have come to an abrupt conclusion, if it had not\r\nbeen that Owenson made interest for him with Lady Moira, a\r\ndistinguished patron of literature, who placed him in the charge of\r\nDr. Boyd, the translator of Dante. Dermody must have had his good\r\npoints, for he was a favourite with Mrs. Owenson, and the dear friend\r\nof Sydney and Olivia, whom he succeeded in teaching to read and write,\r\na task in which all other preceptors had failed.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Mrs. Owenson died rather suddenly, and the home was broken up.\r\nSydney and Olivia were at once placed at a famous Huguenot school,\r\nwhich had originally been established at Portarlington, but was now\r\nremoved to Clontarf, near Dublin. For the next three years the\r\nchildren had the benefit of the best teaching that could then be\r\nobtained, and were subjected to a discipline which Lady Morgan always\r\ndeclared was the most admirable ever introduced into a 'female\r\nseminary' in any country. Sydney soon became popular among her\r\nfellows, thanks to her knowledge of Irish songs and dances, and it is\r\nevident that her schooldays were among the happiest and most healthful\r\nof her early life. The school was an expensive one, and poor Owenson,\r\nwho, with all his faults, seems to have been a careful and\r\naffectionate father, found it no easy matter to pay for the many\r\n'extras.'\r\n\r\n'I remember once,' writes Lady Morgan,' our music-teacher complained\r\nto my father of our idleness as he sat beside us at the piano, and we\r\nstumbled through the overture to _Artaxerxes_. His answer to her\r\ncomplaint was simple and graphic--for, drawing up the sleeve of a\r\nhandsome surtout, he showed the threadbare sleeve of the black coat\r\nbeneath, and said, touching the whitened seams, \"I should not be\r\ndriven to the subterfuge of wearing a greatcoat this hot weather to\r\nconceal the poverty of my dress beneath, if it were not that I wish to\r\ngive you the advantage of such instruction as you are now\r\nneglecting.\"' The shaft went home, and the music-mistress had no\r\noccasion to complain again. After three years the headmistress retired\r\non her fortune, the school was given up, and the two girls were placed\r\nat what they considered a very inferior establishment in Dublin. Here,\r\nhowever, they had the delight of seeing their father every Sunday,\r\nwhen the widower, leaving the attractions of the city behind, took his\r\nlittle daughters out walking with him. To this time belong memories of\r\nearly visits to the theatre, where Sydney saw Mrs. Siddons for the\r\nfirst and last time, and Miss Farren as Susan in the _Marriage of\r\nFigaro_, just before her own marriage to Lord Derby. During the\r\nsummer seasons Mr. Owenson toured round the provinces, and generally\r\ntook his daughters with him, who seem to have been made much of by the\r\nneighbouring county families.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the too optimistic Owenson unfortunately took it into his head\r\nthat it would be an excellent speculation to build a summer theatre at\r\nKilkenny. Lord Ormond, who took an interest in the project, gave a\r\npiece of land opposite the castle gates, money was borrowed, the\r\ntheatre quickly built, and performers brought at great expense from\r\nDublin. During the summer the house was filled nightly by overflowing\r\naudiences, and everything promised well, when the attorney who held a\r\nmortgage on the building, foreclosed, and bills to an enormous amount\r\nwere presented. Mr. Owenson suddenly departed for the south of\r\nIreland, having been advised to keep out of the way until after the\r\nfinal meeting of his creditors. His two daughters were placed in\r\nDublin lodgings under the care of their faithful old servant, Molly\r\nAtkins, until their school should reopen.\r\n\r\nSydney had been requested to write to her father every day, and as she\r\nwas passionately fond, to quote her own words, of writing about\r\nanything to any one, she willingly obeyed, trusting to chance for\r\nfranks. Some of these youthful epistles were preserved by old Molly,\r\nthe packet being indorsed on the cover, 'Letters from Miss Sydney\r\nOwenson to her father, God pity her!' But the young lady evidently did\r\nnot consider herself an object of pity, for she writes in the best of\r\nspirits about the books she is reading, the people she is meeting, and\r\nall the little gaieties and excitements of her life. Somebody lends\r\nher an _Essay on the Human Understanding_, by Mr. Locke, Gent.,\r\nwhose theories she has no difficulty in understanding; and somebody\r\nelse talks to her about chemistry (a word she has never heard at\r\nschool), and declares that her questions are so _suggestive_\r\n(another new word) that she might become a second Pauline Lavosier.\r\nShe puts her new knowledge to practical effect by writing with a piece\r\nof phosphorus on her bedroom wall, 'Molly, beware!' with the result\r\nthat Molly is frightened out of her wits, the young experimenter burns\r\nher hand, and the house is nearly set on fire. The eccentric Dermody\r\nturns up again, now a smart young ensign, having temporarily forsaken\r\nletters, and obtained a commission through the interest of Lord Moira.\r\nHe addresses a flattering poem to Sydney, and passes on to rejoin his\r\nregiment at Cork, whence he is to sail for Flanders.\r\n\r\nMr. Owenson's affairs did not improve. He tried his fortune in various\r\nprovincial theatres, but the political ferment of the years\r\nimmediately preceding the Union, the disturbed state of the country,\r\nand the persecution of the Catholics, all spelt ruin for theatrical\r\nenterprises. As soon as Sydney realised her true position she rose to\r\nthe occasion, and the letter that she wrote to her father, proposing\r\nto relieve him of the burden of her maintenance, is full of affection\r\nand spirit. It will be observed that as yet she is contented to\r\nexpress herself simply and naturally, without the fine language, the\r\nincessant quotations, and the mangled French that disfigured so much\r\nof her published work. The girl, who must now have been seventeen or\r\neighteen, had seen her father's name on the list of bankrupts, but it\r\nhad been explained to her that, with time and economy, he would come\r\nout of his difficulties as much respected as ever. Having informed him\r\nof her determination not to return to school, but to support herself\r\nin future, she continues:--\r\n\r\n'Now, dear papa, I have two novels nearly finished. The first is\r\n_St. Clair_; I think I wrote it in imitation of _Werther_, which\r\nI read last Christmas. The second is a French novel, suggested\r\nby my reading the _Memoirs of the Duc de Sully_, and falling in\r\nlove with Henri IV. Now, if I had time and quiet to finish them, I am\r\nsure I could sell them; and observe, sir, Miss Burney got £3000 for\r\n_Camilla_, and brought out _Evelina_ unknown to her father;\r\nbut all this takes time.' Sydney goes on to suggest that Olivia shall\r\nbe placed at a school, where Molly could be taken as children's maid,\r\nand that she herself should seek a situation as governess or companion\r\nto young ladies.\r\n\r\nThrough the good offices of her old dancing-master, M. Fontaine, who\r\nhad been appointed master of ceremonies at the castle, Sydney was\r\nintroduced to Mrs. Featherstone, or Featherstonehaugh, of Bracklin\r\nCastle, who required a governess-companion to her young daughters, and\r\napparently did not object to youth and inexperience. The girl's\r\n_début_ in her employer's family would scarcely have made a\r\nfavourable impression in any country less genial and tolerant than the\r\nIreland of that period. On the night of her departure M. Fontaine gave\r\na little _bal d'adieu_ in her honour, and as the mail passed the\r\nend of his street at midnight, it was arranged that Sydney should take\r\nher travelling-dress with her to the ball, and change before starting\r\non her journey. Of course she took no count of the time, and was gaily\r\ndancing to the tune of 'Money in Both Pockets,' with an agreeable\r\npartner, when the horn sounded at the end of the street. Like an Irish\r\nCinderella, away flew Sydney in her muslin gown and pink shoes and\r\nstockings, followed by her admirers, laden with her portmanteau and\r\nbundle of clothes. There was just time for Molly to throw an old cloak\r\nover her charge, and then the coach door was banged-to, and the little\r\ngoverness travelled away through the winter's night. In the excitement\r\nof an adventure with an officer _en route_, she allowed her\r\nluggage to be carried on in the coach, and arrived at Bracklin, a\r\nshivering little object, in her muslin frock and pink satin shoes. Her\r\nstammered explanations were received with amusement and sympathy by\r\nher kind-hearted hosts, and she was carried off to her own rooms, 'the\r\nprettiest suite you ever saw,' she tells her father, 'a study,\r\nbedroom, and bath-room, a roaring turf fire in the rooms, an open\r\npiano, and lots of books scattered about. Betty, the old nurse,\r\nbrought me a bowl of laughing potatoes, and gave me a hearty \"Much\r\ngood may it do you, miss\"; and didn't I tip her a word of Irish, which\r\ndelighted her.... Our dinner-party were mamma and the two young\r\nladies, two itinerant preceptors, a writing and elocution master, and\r\na dancing-master, and Father Murphy, the P.P.--such fun!--and the Rev.\r\nMr. Beaufort, the curate of Castletown.'\r\n\r\nMiss Sydney was quite at her ease with all these new acquaintances,\r\nand so brilliant were her sallies at dinner that, according to her own\r\naccount, the men-servants were obliged to stuff their napkins down\r\ntheir throats till they were nearly suffocated. The priest proposed\r\nher health in a comic speech, and a piper having come up on purpose to\r\n'play in Miss Owenson,' the evening wound up with the dancing of Irish\r\njigs, and the singing of Irish songs. One is inclined to doubt whether\r\nSydney's instructions were of much scientific value, but it is evident\r\nthat she enjoyed her occupation, was the very good friend of both\r\nemployers and pupils, and knew nothing of the snubs and neglect\r\nexperienced by so many of our modern Jane Eyres.\r\n\r\nThe death of Mrs. Featherstone's mother, Lady Steele, who had been one\r\nof the belles of Lord Chesterfield's court, placed a fine old house in\r\nDominic Street, Dublin, at the disposal of the family. At the head of\r\nthe musical society of Dublin at that date was Sir John Stevenson, who\r\nis now chiefly remembered for his arrangement of the airs to Moore's\r\nMelodies. One day, while giving a lesson to the Miss Featherstones,\r\nSir John sung a song by Moore, of whom Sydney had then never heard.\r\nPleased at her evident appreciation, Stevenson asked if she would like\r\nto meet the poet, and promised to take her and Olivia to a little\r\nmusical party at his mother's house. Moore had already made a success\r\nin London society, which he followed up in the less exclusive circles\r\nof Dublin, and it was only between a party at the Provost's and\r\nanother at Lady Antrim's that he could dash into the paternal shop for\r\na few minutes to sing a couple of songs for his mother's guests. But\r\nthe effect of his performance upon the Owenson sisters was electrical.\r\nThey went home in such a state of spiritual exaltation, that they\r\nforgot to undress before getting into bed, and awoke to plan, the one\r\na new romance, the other a portrait of the poet.\r\n\r\nSydney had already finished her first novel, _St. Clair_, which\r\nshe determined to take secretly to a publisher. We are given to\r\nunderstand that this was her first independent literary attempt,\r\nthough she tells us that her father had printed a little volume of her\r\npoems, written between the ages of twelve and fourteen. This book\r\nseems to have been published, however, in 1801, when the author must\r\nhave been at least one-and-twenty. It was dedicated to Lady Moira,\r\nthrough whose influence it found its way into the most fashionable\r\nboudoirs of Dublin. Be this as it may, Sydney gives a picturesque\r\ndescription of her early morning's ramble in search of a publisher.\r\nShe eventually left her manuscript in the reluctant hands of a Mr.\r\nBrown, who promised to submit it to his reader, and returned to her\r\nemployer's house before her absence had been remarked. The next day\r\nthe family left Dublin for Bracklin, and as Sydney had forgotten to\r\ngive her address to the publisher, it is not surprising that, for the\r\ntime being, she heard no more of her bantling. Some months later, when\r\nshe was in Dublin again, she picked up a novel in a friend's house,\r\nand found that it was her own _St. Clair_. On recalling herself\r\nto the publisher's memory, she received the handsome remuneration\r\nof--four copies of her own work! The book, a foolish, high-flown\r\nstory, a long way after _Werther_, had some success in Dublin,\r\nand brought its author--literary ladies being comparatively few at\r\nthat period--a certain meed of social fame.\r\n\r\nMr. Owenson, who had left the stage in 1798, was settled at Coleraine\r\nat this time, and desired to have both his daughters with him.\r\nAccordingly, Sydney gave up her employment, and tried to make herself\r\ncontented at home. But the dulness and discomfort of the life were too\r\nmuch for her, and after a few months she took another situation as\r\ngoverness, this time with a Mrs. Crawford at Fort William, where she\r\nseems to have been as much petted and admired as at Bracklin. There is\r\nno doubt that Sydney Owenson was a flirt, a sentimental flirt, who\r\nloved playing with fire, but it has been hinted that she was inclined\r\nto represent the polite attentions of her gallant countrymen as\r\nserious affairs of the heart. She left behind her a packet of\r\nlove-letters (presented to her husband after her marriage), and some\r\nof these are quoted in her _Memoirs_. The majority, however,\r\npoint to no very definite 'intentions' on the part of the writers, but\r\nare composed in the artificially romantic vein which Rousseau had\r\nbrought into fashion. Among the letters are one or two from the\r\nunfortunate Dermody, who had retired on half-pay, and was now living\r\nin London, engaged in writing his Memoirs (he was in the early\r\ntwenties) and preparing his poems for the press.\r\n\r\n'Were you a Venus I should forget you,' he writes to Sydney, 'but you\r\nare a Laura, a Leonora, and an Eloisa, all in one delightful\r\nassemblage.' He is evidently a little piqued by Sydney's admiration of\r\nMoore, for in a letter to Mr. Owenson he asks, 'Who is the Mr. Moore\r\nSydney mentions? He is nobody here, I assure you, of eminence.' A\r\nlittle later, however, he writes to Sydney: 'You are mistaken if you\r\nimagine I have not the highest respect for your friend Moore. I have\r\nwritten the review of his poems in a strain of panegyric to which I am\r\nnot frequently accustomed. I am told he is a most worthy young man,\r\nand I am certain myself of his genius and erudition.' Dermody's own\r\ncareer was nearly at an end. He died of consumption in 1802, aged only\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nIf Sydney scandalised even the easy-going society of the period by her\r\naudacious flirtations, she seems to have had the peculiarly Irish\r\nfaculty of keeping her head in affairs of the heart, and dancing in\r\nperfect security on the edge of a gulf of sentiment. Her work helped\r\nto steady her, and the love-scenes in her novels served as a\r\nsafety-valve for her ardent imagination. Her father, notoriously\r\nhappy-go-lucky about his own affairs, was a careful guardian of his\r\ndaughters' reputation, while old Molly was a dragon of propriety.\r\nSydney, moreover, had acquired one or two women friends, much older\r\nthan herself, such as the literary Lady Charleville, and Mrs. Lefanu,\r\nsister of Sheridan, who were always ready with advice and sympathy.\r\nWith Mrs. Lefanu Sydney corresponded regularly for many years, and in\r\nher letters discusses the debatable points in her books, and enlarges\r\nupon her own character and temperament. Chief among her ambitions at\r\nthis time was that of being 'every inch a woman,' and she was a firm\r\nbeliever in the fashionable theory that true womanliness was\r\nincompatible with learning. 'I dropped the study of chemistry,' she\r\ntells her friend, 'though urged to it by, a favourite preceptor, lest\r\nI should be less the _woman_. Seduced by taste and a thousand\r\narguments to Greek and Latin, I resisted, lest I should not be a\r\n_very woman_. And I have studied music as a sentiment rather than\r\nas a science, and drawing as an amusement rather than as an art, lest\r\nI should become a musical pedant, or a masculine artist.'\r\n\r\nIn 1803, the Crawfords having decided to leave Fort William and live\r\nentirely in the country, Sydney, who had a mortal dread of boredom,\r\ngave up her situation, and returned to her father, who was now settled\r\nnear Strabane. Here she occupied her leisure in writing a second\r\nnovel, _The Novice of St. Dominic_, in six volumes. When this was\r\ncompleted, Mrs. Lefanu advised her to take it to London herself, and\r\narrange for its publication. Quite alone, and with very little money\r\nin her pocket, the girl travelled to London, and presented herself\r\nbefore Sir Richard Phillips, a well-known publisher, with whom she had\r\nalready had some correspondence. If we may believe her own testimony,\r\nSir Richard fell an easy victim to her fascinations, and there is no\r\ndoubt that he was very kind to her, introduced her to his wife, and\r\nfound her a lodging. Better still, he bought her book (we are not told\r\nthe price), and paid her for it at once. The first purchases that she\r\nmade with her own earnings were a small Irish harp, which accompanied\r\nher thereafter wherever she went, and a black 'mode cloak.' After her\r\nreturn to Ireland, Phillips corresponded with her, and gave her\r\nliterary advice, which is interesting in so far as it shows what the\r\nreading public of that day wanted, or was supposed to want.\r\n\r\n'The world is not informed about Ireland,' wrote the publisher, 'and I\r\nam in a condition to command the light to shine. I am sorry you have\r\nassumed the novel form. A series of letters addressed to a friend in\r\nLondon, taking for your model the letters of Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu, would have secured you the most extensive reading. A\r\nmatter-of-fact and didactic novel is neither one thing nor the other,\r\nand suits no class of readers. Certainly, however, _Paul and\r\nVirginia_ would suggest a local plan; and it will be possible by\r\nwriting three or four times over in six or eight months to produce\r\nwhat would _command_ attention.' Sir Richard concluded his advice\r\nwith the assurance that his correspondent had it in her to write an\r\nimmortal work, if she would only labour it sufficiently, and that her\r\n_third_ copy was certain to be a monument of Irish genius. Miss\r\nOwenson was the last person to act upon the above directions; her\r\nbooks read as if they were dashed off in a fine frenzy of composition.\r\nPerhaps she feared that her cherished womanliness would be endangered\r\nby too close an attention to accuracy and style.\r\n\r\nThe _Novice_, which appeared in 1804, was better than _St.\r\nClair_, but such success as it enjoyed must have been due to the\r\nprevailing scarcity of first-rate, or even second-rate novelists,\r\nrather than to its own intrinsic merits. The public taste in fiction\r\nwas not fastidious, and could swallow long-winded discussions and\r\nsentimental rhodomontade with an appetite that now seems almost\r\nincredible. The _Novice_ is said to have been a favourite with\r\nPitt in his last illness, but if this be true, the fact points rather\r\nto the decay of the statesman's intellect than to the literary value\r\nof the book. Still the author was tasting all the sweets of fame. She\r\nwas much in request as a literary celebrity, and somebody had actually\r\nwritten for permission to select the best passages from her two books\r\nfor publication in a work called _The Morality of English\r\nNovels_.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1804, an anonymous attack upon the Irish stage in\r\nsix _Familiar Epistles_ was published in Dublin. So cruel and\r\nvenomous were these epistles that one actor, Edwin, is believed to\r\nhave died of chagrin at the attack upon his reputation. An answer to\r\nthe libel presently appeared, which was signed S. O., and has been\r\ngenerally attributed to Sydney Owenson. The _Familiar Epistles_\r\nwere believed to be the work of John Wilson Croker, then young and\r\nunknown, and it may be that the lifelong malignity with which that\r\ncritic pursued Lady Morgan was due to this early crossing of swords.\r\nSydney herself was fond of hinting that Croker, in his obscure days,\r\nhad paid her attentions which she, as a successful author, had not\r\ncared to encourage, and that wounded vanity was at the bottom of his\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nThe next book on which Miss Owenson engaged was, if not her best, the\r\none by which she is best known, namely, _The Wild Irish Girl_.\r\nThe greater part of this was written while she was staying with Sir\r\nMalby Crofton at Longford House, from whose family, as has been seen,\r\nshe claimed to be descended. Miss Crofton sat for the portrait of the\r\nheroine, and much of the scenery was sketched in the wild romantic\r\nneighbourhood. About the same time she collected and translated a\r\nnumber of Irish songs which were published under the title of _The\r\nLay of the Irish Harp_. She thus anticipated Moore, and other\r\nexplorers in this field, for which fact Moore at least gives her\r\ncredit in the preface to his own collection. She was not a poet, but\r\nshe wrote one ballad, 'Kate Kearney,' which became a popular song, and\r\nis not yet forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe story of _The Wild Irish Girl_ is said to have been founded\r\nupon an incident in the author's own life. A young man named Everard\r\nhad fallen in love with her, but as he was wild, idle, and penniless,\r\nhis father called upon her to beg her not to encourage him, but to use\r\nher influence to make him stick to his work. Sydney behaved so well in\r\nthe matter that the elder Mr. Everard desired to marry her himself,\r\nand though his offer was not accepted, he remained her staunch friend\r\nand admirer. The 'local colour' in the book is carefully worked up;\r\nindeed, in the present day it would probably be thought that the story\r\nwas overweighted by the account of local manners and customs.\r\nPhillips, alarmed at the liberal principles displayed in the work,\r\nwhich he thought would be distasteful to English patriots, refused at\r\nfirst to give the author her price. To his horror and indignation Miss\r\nOwenson, whom he regarded as his own particular property, instantly\r\nsent the manuscript to a rival bookseller, Johnson, who published for\r\nMiss Edgeworth. Johnson offered £300 for the book, while Phillips had\r\nonly offered £200 down, and £50 on the publication of the second and\r\nthird editions respectively. The latter, however, was unable to make\r\nup his mind to lose the treasure, and after much hesitation and many\r\nheart-burnings, he finally wrote to Miss Owenson:--\r\n\r\n\r\n'DEAR BEWITCHING AND DELUDING SYKEN,--Not being able to part from you,\r\nI have promised your noble and magnanimous friend, Atkinson [who was\r\nconducting the negotiations], the £300.... It will be long before I\r\nforgive you! At least not till I have got back the £300 and another\r\n£100 along with it.' Then follows a passage which proves that the\r\nliterary market, in those days at any rate, was not overstocked: 'If\r\nyou know any poor bard--a real one, no pretender--I will give him a\r\nguinea a page for his rhymes in the _Monthly Magazine_. I will\r\nalso give for prose communications at the rate of six guineas a\r\nsheet.'\r\n\r\n_The Wild Irish Girl_, whose title was suggested by Peter Pindar,\r\nmade a hit, more especially in Ireland, and the author woke to find\r\nherself famous. She became known to all her friends as 'Glorvina,' the\r\nname of the heroine, while the Glorvina ornament, a golden bodkin, and\r\nthe Glorvina mantle became fashionable in Dublin. The book was\r\nbitterly attacked, probably by Croker, in the _Freeman's\r\nJournal_, but the best bit of criticism upon it is contained in a\r\nletter from Mr. Edgeworth to Miss Owenson. 'Maria,' he says, 'who\r\nreads as well as she writes, has entertained us with several passages\r\nfrom _The Wild Irish Girl_, which I thought superior to any parts\r\nof the book I had read. Upon looking over her shoulder, I found she\r\nhad omitted some superfluous epithets. Dared she have done this if you\r\nhad been by? I think she would; because your good sense and good taste\r\nwould have been instantly her defenders.' It must be admitted that all\r\nLady Morgan's works would have gained by the like treatment.\r\n\r\nIn an article called 'My First Rout,' which appeared in _The Book of\r\nthe Boudoir_ (published in 1829), Lady Morgan describes a party at\r\nLady Cork's, where she was lionised by her hostess, the other guests\r\nhaving been invited to meet the Wild Irish Girl. The celebrities\r\npresent were brought up and introduced to Miss Owenson with a running\r\ncomment from Lady Cork, which, though it must be taken with a grain of\r\nsalt, is worth transcribing:--\r\n\r\n'Lord Erskine, this is the Wild Irish Girl you were so anxious to\r\nmeet. I assure you she talks quite as well as she writes. Now, my\r\ndear, do tell Lord Erskine some of those Irish stories you told us at\r\nLord Charleville's. Mrs. Abington says you would make a famous\r\nactress, she does indeed. This is the Duchess of St. Albans--she has\r\nyour _Wild Irish Girl_ by heart. Where is Sheridan? Oh, here he\r\nis; what, you know each other already? _Tant mieux._ Mr. Lewis,\r\ndo come forward; this is Monk Lewis, of whom you have heard so\r\nmuch--but you must not read his works, they are very naughty.... You\r\nknow Mr. Gell; he calls you the Irish Corinne. Your friend, Mr. Moore,\r\nwill be here by-and-by. Do see, somebody, if Mrs. Siddons and Mr.\r\nKemble are come yet. Now pray tell us the scene at the Irish baronet's\r\nin the Rebellion that you told to the ladies of Llangollen; and then\r\ngive us your blue-stocking dinner at Sir Richard Phillips'; and\r\ndescribe the Irish priests.'\r\n\r\nAt supper Sydney was placed between Lord Erskine and Lord Carysfort,\r\nand was just beginning to feel at her ease when Mr. Kemble was\r\nannounced. Mr. Kemble, it soon became apparent, had been dining, and\r\nhad paid too much attention to the claret. Sitting down opposite Miss\r\nOwenson, he fixed her with an intense and glassy stare. Unfortunately,\r\nher hair, which she wore in the fashionable curly 'crop,' aroused his\r\ncuriosity. Stretching unsteadily across the table, he suddenly, to\r\nquote her own words, 'struck his claws into my locks, and addressing\r\nme in his deepest tones, asked, \"Little girl, where did you buy your\r\nwig?\"' Lord Erskine hastily came to the rescue, but Kemble, rendered\r\npeevish by his interference, took a volume of _The Wild Irish\r\nGirl_ out of his pocket, and after reading aloud one of the most\r\nhigh-flown passages, asked, 'Little girl, why did you write such\r\nnonsense, and where did you get all those hard words?' Sydney\r\ndelighted the company by blurting out the truth: 'Sir, I wrote as well\r\nas I could, and I got the hard words out of Johnson's Dictionary.'\r\nThat Kemble spoke the truth in his cups may be proved by the following\r\nsentence, which is a fair sample of the general style of the book:\r\n'With a character tinctured with the brightest colouring of romantic\r\neccentricity [a father is describing his son, the hero], but marked by\r\nindelible traces of innate rectitude, and ennobled by the purest\r\nprinciples of native generosity, the proudest sense of inviolable\r\nhonour, I beheld him rush eagerly on life, enamoured of its seeming\r\ngood, incredulous of its latent evils, till, fatally entangled in the\r\nspells of the latter, he fell an early victim to their successful\r\nallurements.'\r\n\r\n_The Wild Irish Girl_ was followed by _Patriotic Sketches_\r\nand a volume of poems, for which Sir Richard Phillips offered £100\r\nbefore he read them. A little later, in 1807, an operetta called\r\n_The First Attempt_, or the _Whim of the Moment_, the libretto\r\nby Miss Owenson and the music by T. Cooke, was performed at\r\nthe Dublin Theatre. The Duke of Bedford, then Lord-Lieutenant,\r\nattended in state, the Duchess wore a Glorvina bodkin, and the\r\nentertainment was also patronised by the officers of the garrison and\r\nall the liberal members of the Irish bar. The little piece, in which\r\nMr. Owenson acted an Irish character, was played for several nights,\r\nand brought its author the handsome sum of £400. This, however, seems\r\nto have been Sydney's first and last attempt at dramatic composition.\r\n\r\nThe family fortunes had improved somewhat at this time, for Olivia,\r\nwho had gone out as a governess, became engaged to Dr., afterwards Sir\r\nArthur Clarke, a plain, elderly little gentleman, who, however, made\r\nher an excellent husband. Having a good house and a comfortable\r\nincome, he was able to offer a home to Mr. Owenson and to the faithful\r\nMolly. For the present, Sydney, though always on excellent terms with\r\nher brother-in-law, preferred her independence. She established\r\nherself in lodgings in Dublin, and made the most of the position that\r\nher works had won for her. Her flirtations and indiscretions provided\r\nthe town with plenty of occasion for scandal, and there is a tradition\r\nthat one strictly proper old lady, on being asked to chaperon Miss\r\nOwenson to the Castle, replied that when Miss Owenson wore more\r\npetticoats and less paint she would be happy to do so. Yet another\r\ntradition has been handed down to the effect that Miss Owenson\r\nappeared at one of the Viceregal balls in a dress, the bodice of which\r\nwas trimmed with the portraits of her rejected lovers!\r\n\r\nForemost among our heroine's admirers at this time was Sir Charles\r\nOrmsby, K.C., then member for Munster, He was a widower, deeply in\r\ndebt, and a good deal older than Sydney, but if there was no actual\r\nengagement, there was certainly an 'understanding' between the pair.\r\nIn May, 1808, Miss Owenson was on a visit to the Dowager Lady Stanley\r\nof Alderley at Penrhôs (one of the new friends her celebrity had\r\ngained for her), whence she wrote a sentimental epistle to Sir Charles\r\nOrmsby. The Sir John Stanley mentioned in the letter was the husband\r\nof Maria Josepha Holroyd, to whom he had been married in 1796.\r\n\r\n'The figure and person of Lady Stanley are inimitable,' writes Sydney.\r\n'Vandyck would have estimated her at millions. Though old, her\r\nmanners, her mind, and her conversation are all of the best school....\r\nSir John Stanley is a man _comme il y en a peu_. Something at\r\nfirst of English reserve; but when worn off, I never met a mind more\r\ndaring, more independent in its reflections, more profound or more\r\nrefined in its ideas. He said a thousand things like you; I am\r\nconvinced he has loved as you love. We sat up till two this morning\r\ntalking of Corinne.... I have been obliged to sing \"Deep in Love\" so\r\noften for my handsome host, and every time it is _as for you_ I\r\nsing it.' The letter concludes with the words, '_Aimons toujours\r\ncomme à l'ordinaire_.' The pair may have loved, but they were\r\ncontinually quarrelling, and their intimacy was finally broken a year\r\nor two later. Lady Morgan preserved to the end of her days a packet of\r\nlove-letters indorsed, 'Sir Charles Montague Ormsby, Bart., one of the\r\nmost brilliant wits, determined _roués_, agreeable persons, and\r\nugliest men of his day.'\r\n\r\nThe summer of this year, 1808, Miss Owenson spent in a round of visits\r\nto country-houses, and in working, amid many distractions, at her\r\nGrecian novel, _Ida of Athens_. After the first volume had gone\r\nto press, Phillips took fright at some of the opinions therein\r\nexpressed, and refused to proceed further with the work. It was then\r\naccepted by Longmans, who, however, were somewhat alarmed at what they\r\nconsidered the Deistical principles and the taint of French philosophy\r\nthat ran through the book. Ida is a houri and a woman of genius, who\r\ndresses in a tissue of woven air, has a taste for philosophical\r\ndiscussions, and a talent for getting into perilous situations, from\r\nwhich her strong sense of propriety invariably delivers her. This book\r\nwas the subject of adverse criticism in the first number of the\r\n_Quarterly Review_, the critic being, it is believed, Miss\r\nOwenson's old enemy, Croker. As a work of art, the novel was certainly\r\na just object of ridicule, but the personalities by which the review\r\nis disfigured were unworthy of a responsible critic.\r\n\r\n'The language,' observes the reviewer, 'is an inflated jargon,\r\ncomposed of terms picked up in all countries, and wholly irreducible\r\nto any ordinary rules of grammar and sense. The sentiments are\r\nmischievous in tendency, profligate in principle, licentious and\r\nirreverent in the highest degree.' The first part of this accusation\r\nwas only too well founded, but the licentiousness of which Lady\r\nMorgan's works were invariably accused in the _Quarterly Review_,\r\ncan only have existed in the mind of the reviewer. One cannot but\r\nsmile to think how many persons with a taste for highly-spiced fiction\r\nmust have been set searching through Lady Morgan's novels by these\r\nnotices, and how bitterly they must have been disappointed. The review\r\nin question concludes with the remark that if the author would buy a\r\nspelling-book, a pocket-dictionary, exchange her raptures for common\r\nsense, and gather a few precepts of humility from the Bible, 'she\r\nmight hope to prove, not indeed a good writer of novels, but a useful\r\nfriend, a faithful wife, a tender mother, and a respectable and happy\r\nmistress of a family.' This impertinence is thoroughly characteristic\r\nof the days when the _Quarterly_ was regarded as an amusing but\r\nfrivolous, not to say flippant, publication.\r\n\r\n_Ida of Athens_ received the honour of mention in a note to\r\n_Childe Harold_. 'I will request Miss Owenson,' writes Byron,\r\n'when she next chooses an Athenian heroine for her four volumes, to\r\nhave the goodness to marry her to somebody more of a gentleman than a\r\n\"Disdar Aga\" (who, by the way, is not an Aga), the most impolite of\r\npetty officers, the greatest patron of larceny Athens ever saw (except\r\nLord E[lgin]), and the unworthy occupant of the Acropolis, on a\r\nhandsome stipend of 150 piastres (£8 sterling), out of which he has to\r\npay his garrison, the most ill-regulated corps in the ill-regulated\r\nOttoman Empire. I speak it tenderly, seeing I was once the cause of\r\nthe husband of Ida nearly suffering the bastinado; and because the\r\nsaid Disdar is a turbulent fellow who beats his wife, so that I exhort\r\nand beseech Miss Owenson to sue for a separate maintenance on behalf\r\nof Ida.'\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Lady Abercorn, the third wife of the first Marquis, having\r\ntaken a sudden fancy to Miss Owenson, proposed that she should come to\r\nStanmore Priory, and afterwards to Baron's Court, as a kind of\r\npermanent visitor. A fine lady of the old-fashioned, languid, idle,\r\neasily bored type, Lady Abercorn desired a lively, amusing companion,\r\nwho would deliver her from the terrors of a solitude _à deux,_\r\nmake music in the evenings, and help to entertain her guests. It was\r\nrepresented to Sydney that such an invitation was not lightly to be\r\nrefused, but as acceptance involved an almost total separation from\r\nher friends, she hesitated to enter into any actual engagement, and\r\nwent to the Abercorns for two or three months as an ordinary visitor.\r\nLord Abercorn, who was then between fifty and sixty, had been married\r\nthree times, and divorced once. So fastidious a fine gentleman was he\r\nthat the maids were not allowed to make his bed except in white kid\r\ngloves, and his groom of his chambers had orders to fumigate his rooms\r\nafter liveried servants had been in them. He is described as handsome,\r\nwitty, and blasé, a _roué_ in principles and a Tory in politics.\r\nNothing pleased Lady Morgan better in her old age, we are told, than\r\nto have it insinuated that there had been 'something wrong' between\r\nherself and Lord Abercorn.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1810, Sydney writes to Mrs. Lefanu from Stanmore Priory to\r\nthe effect that she is the best-lodged, best-fed, dullest author in\r\nhis Majesty's dominions, and that the sound of a commoner's name is\r\nrefreshment to her ears. She is surrounded by ex-lord-lieutenants,\r\nunpopular princesses (including her of Wales) deposed potentates\r\n(including him of Sweden), half the nobility of England, and many of\r\nthe best wits and writers. She had sat to Sir Thomas Lawrence for her\r\nportrait, and sold her Indian novel, _The Missionary,_ for a\r\nfamous price. Lord Castlereagh, while staying at Stanmore, heard\r\nportions of the work read aloud, and admired it so much that he\r\noffered to take the author to London, and give her a rendezvous with\r\nher publisher in his own study. Stockdale, the publisher, was so much\r\nimpressed by his surroundings that he bid £400 for the book, and the\r\nagreement was signed and sealed under Lord Castlereagh's eye. _The\r\nMissionary_ was not so successful as _The Wild Irish Girl,_\r\nand added nothing to the author's reputation.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of 1810 that Miss Owenson decided to become a\r\npermanent member of the Abercorn household. About this time, or a\r\nlittle later, she wrote a short description of her temperament and\r\nfeelings, from which a sentence or two may be quoted. 'Inconsiderate\r\nand indiscreet, never saved by prudence, but often rescued by pride;\r\noften on the verge of error, but never passing the line. Committing\r\nmyself in every way _except in my own esteem_--without any\r\ncommand over my feelings, my words, or writings--yet full of\r\nself-possession as to action and conduct.' After describing her\r\nsufferings from nervous susceptibility and mental depression, she\r\ncontinues: 'But the hand that writes this has lost nothing of the\r\ncontour of health or the symmetry of youth. I am in possession of all\r\nthe fame I ever hoped or ambitioned. I wear not the appearance of\r\ntwenty years; I am now, as I generally am, sad and miserable.'\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Dr. Morgan, a good-looking widower of about eight-and-twenty,\r\naccepted the post of private physician to Lord Abercorn. He was a\r\nCambridge man, an intimate friend of Dr. Jenner's, and possessed a\r\nsmall fortune of his own. When he first arrived at Baron's Court, Miss\r\nOwenson was absent, and he heard so much of her praises that he\r\nconceived a violent prejudice against her. On her return she set to\r\nwork systematically to fascinate him, and succeeded even better than\r\nshe had hoped or desired. In Lady Abercorn he had a warm partisan, but\r\nit may be suspected that the ambitious Miss Owenson found it hard to\r\nrenounce all hopes of a more brilliant match. The Abercorns having\r\nvowed that Dr. Morgan should be made Sir Charles, and that they would\r\npush his fortunes, Sydney yielded to their importunities so far as to\r\nwrite to her father, and ask his consent to her engagement.\r\n\r\n'I dare say you will be amazingly astonished,' she observes, 'but not\r\nhalf so much as I am, for Lord and Lady Abercorn have hurried on the\r\nbusiness in such a manner that I really don't know what I am about.\r\nThey called me in last night, and, more like parents than friends,\r\nbegged me to be guided by them--that it was their wish not to lose\r\nsight of me ... and that if I accepted Morgan, the man upon earth they\r\nmost esteemed and approved, they would be friends to both for\r\nlife--that we should reside with them one year after our marriage, so\r\nthat we might lay up our income to begin the world. He is also to\r\ncontinue their physician. He has now £500 a year, independent of his\r\npractice. I don't myself see the thing quite in the light they do; but\r\nthey think him a man of such great abilities, such great worth and\r\nhonour, that I am the most fortunate person in the world.'\r\n\r\nTo her old friend, Mrs. Lefanu, she writes in much the same strain.\r\n'The licence and ring have been in the house these ten days, and all\r\nthe settlements made; yet I have been battling off from day to day,\r\nand have only ten minutes back procured a little breathing time. The\r\nstruggle is almost too great for me. On one side engaged, beyond\r\nretrieval, to a man who has frequently declared to my friends that if\r\nI break off he will not survive it! On the other, the dreadful\r\ncertainty of being parted for ever from a country and friends I love,\r\nand a family I adore.'\r\n\r\nThe 'breathing time' was to consist of a fortnight's visit to her\r\nsister, Lady Clarke, in Dublin, in order to be near her father, who\r\nwas in failing health. The fortnight, however, proved an exceedingly\r\nelastic period. Mr. Owenson was not dangerously ill, the winter season\r\nwas just beginning, and Miss Owenson was more popular than ever. Her\r\nunfortunate lover, as jealous as he was enamoured, being detained by\r\nhis duties at Baron's Court, could only write long letters of\r\ncomplaint, reproach, and appeal to his hard-hearted lady. Sydney was\r\nthoroughly enjoying herself, and was determined to make the most of\r\nher last days of liberty. She admitted afterwards that she had behaved\r\nvery badly at this time, and deserved to have lost the best husband\r\nwoman ever had.\r\n\r\n'I picture to myself,' writes poor Dr. Morgan, 'the thoughtless and\r\nheartless Glorvina trifling with her friend, jesting at his\r\nsufferings, and flirting with every man she meets.' He sends her some\r\ncommissions, but declares that there is only one about which he is\r\nreally anxious, 'and that is to love me _exclusively_; to prefer\r\nme to every other good; to think of me, speak of me, write to me, and\r\nlook forward to our union as to the completion of every wish, as I do\r\nby you. Do this, and though you grow as ugly as Sycorax, you will\r\nnever lose in me the fondest, most doating, affectionate of husbands.\r\nGlorvina, I was born for tenderness; my business in life is _to\r\nlove_.... I read part of _The Way to Keep Him_ this morning,\r\nand I see now you take the widow for your model; but it won't do, for\r\nthough I love you in _every_ mood, it is only when you are true\r\nto nature, passionate and tender, that I adore you. You are never less\r\ninteresting to me than when you _brillez_ in a large party.'\r\n\r\nThe fortnight's leave of absence had been granted in September, and by\r\nthe end of November Dr. Morgan is thoroughly displeased with his\r\ntruant _fiancée_, and asks why she could not have told him when\r\nshe went away, that she intended to stay till Christmas. 'I know, he\r\nwrites, 'this is but a specimen of the roundabout policy of all your\r\ncountrywomen. How strange it is that you, who are in general\r\n_great_ beyond every woman I know, philosophical and magnanimous,\r\nshould _in detail_ be so often ill-judging, wrong, and (shall I\r\nsay) little?' In December Sydney writes to say that she will return\r\ndirectly after Christmas, and declares that the terrible struggle of\r\nfeeling, which she had tried to forget in every species of mental\r\ndissipation, is now over; friends, relatives, country, all are\r\nresigned, and she is his for ever! A little later she shows signs of\r\nwavering again; she cannot make up her mind to part from her invalid\r\nfather just yet; but this time Dr. Morgan puts his foot down, and\r\nissues his ultimatum in a stern and manly letter. He will be trifled\r\nwith no longer. Sydney must either keep her promise and return at\r\nChristmas, or they had better part, never to meet again. 'The love I\r\nrequire,' he writes, 'is no ordinary affection. The woman who marries\r\nme must be _identified_ with me. I must have a large bank of\r\ntenderness to draw upon. I must have frequent profession and frequent\r\ndemonstration of it. Woman's love is all in all to me; it stands in\r\nplace of honours and riches, and what is yet more, in place of\r\ntranquillity of mind.'\r\n\r\nThis letter, backed by one from Lady Abercorn, brought Sydney to her\r\nsenses. In the first days of the new year (1812) she arrived at\r\nBaron's Court, a little shamefaced, and more than a little doubtful of\r\nher reception. The marquis was stiff, and the marchioness stately, but\r\nSir Charles, who had just been knighted by the Lord Lieutenant, was\r\ntoo pleased to get his lady-love back, to harbour any resentment\r\nagainst her. A few days after her return, as she was sitting over the\r\nfire in a morning wrapper, Lady Abercorn came in and said:\r\n\r\n'Glorvina, come upstairs directly and be married; there must be no\r\nmore trifling.'\r\n\r\nThe bride was led into her ladyship's dressing-room, where the\r\nbridegroom was awaiting her in company with the chaplain, and the\r\nceremony took place. The marriage was kept a secret from the other\r\nguests at the time, but a few nights later Lord Abercorn filled his\r\nglass after dinner, and drank to the health of 'Sir Charles and Lady\r\nMorgan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marriage, unpromising as it appeared at the outset, proved an\r\nexceptionally happy one. Sir Charles was a straightforward, worthy, if\r\nsomewhat dull gentleman, with no ambition, a nervous distaste for\r\nsociety, and a natural indolence of temperament. To his wife he gave\r\nthe unstinted sympathy and admiration that her restless vanity craved,\r\nwhile she invariably maintained that he was the wisest, brightest, and\r\nhandsomest of his sex. She seems to have given him no occasion for\r\njealousy after marriage, though to the last she preserved her passion\r\nfor society, and her ambition for social recognition and success. The\r\nfirst year of married life, which she described as a period of storm,\r\ninterspersed with brilliant sunshine, was spent with the Abercorns at\r\nBaron's Court.\r\n\r\n'Though living in a palace,' wrote Sydney to Mrs. Lefanu, early in\r\n1812, 'we have all the comfort and independence of a home.... As to\r\nme, I am _every inch a wife_, and so ends that brilliant thing\r\nthat was Glorvina. _N.B._--I intend to write a book to explode\r\nthe vulgar idea of matrimony being the tomb of love. Matrimony is the\r\nreal thing, and all before but leather and prunella.' In a letter to\r\nLady Stanley she paints Sir Charles in the romantic colours\r\nappropriate to a novelist's husband. 'In _love_ he is Sheridan's\r\nFalkland, and in his view of things there is a _mélange_ of\r\ncynicism and sentiment that will never suffer him to be as happy as\r\nthe inferior million that move about him. Marriage has taken nothing\r\nfrom the _romance_ of his passion for me; and by bringing a sense\r\nof _property_ with it, has rendered him more exigent and nervous\r\nabout me than before.'\r\n\r\nThe luxury of Baron's Court was probably more than counterbalanced by\r\nthe inevitable drawbacks of married life in a patron's household,\r\nwhere the husband, at least, was at that patron's beck and call.\r\nBefore the end of the year, the Morgans were contemplating a modest\r\nestablishment of their own, and Sydney had set to work upon a novel,\r\nthe price of which was to furnish the new house. Mr. Owenson had died\r\nshortly after his daughter's marriage, and Lady Morgan persuaded her\r\nhusband to settle in Dublin, in order that she might be near her\r\nsister and her many friends. A house was presently taken in Kildare\r\nStreet, and Sir Charles, who had obtained the post of physician to the\r\nMarshalsea, set himself to establish a practice. Lady Morgan prided\r\nherself upon her housewifely talents, and in a letter dated May, 1813,\r\nshe describes how she has made their old house clean and comfortable,\r\nall that their means would permit, 'except for one little bit of a\r\nroom, four inches by three, which is fitted up in the _Gothic_,\r\nand I have collected into it the best part of a very good cabinet of\r\nnatural history of Sir Charles's, eight or nine hundred volumes of\r\nchoice books in French, English, Italian, and German, some little\r\ncuriosities, and a few scraps of old china, so that, with muslin\r\ndraperies, etc., I have made no contemptible set-out.... With respect\r\nto authorship, I fear it is over; I have been making chair-covers\r\ninstead of systems, and cheapening pots and pans instead of selling\r\nsentiment and philosophy.'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all her domestic labours, however, Lady Morgan\r\ncontrived to finish a novel, _O'Donnel_, which Colburn published\r\nin 1814, and for which she received £550. The book was ill-reviewed,\r\nbut it was an even greater popular success than _The Wild Irish\r\nGirl_. The heroine, like most of Lady Morgan's heroines, is\r\nevidently meant for an idealised portrait of herself, and the great\r\nladies by whom she is surrounded are sketched from Lady Abercorn and\r\ncertain of the guests at Baron's Court. The Liberal, or as they would\r\nnow be called, Radical principles inculcated in the book gave bitter\r\noffence to the author's old-fashioned friends, and increased the\r\nrancour of her Tory reviewers. But _O'Donnel_ found numerous\r\nadmirers, among them no less a person than Sir Walter Scott, who notes\r\nin his diary for March 14, 1826: 'I have amused myself occasionally\r\nvery pleasantly during the last few days by reading over Lady Morgan's\r\nnovel of _O'Donnel_, which has some striking and beautiful\r\npassages of situation and description, and in the comic part is very\r\nrich and entertaining. I do not remember being so pleased with it at\r\nfirst. There is a want of story, always fatal to a book on the first\r\nreading--and it is well if it gets the chance of a second.'\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1815, France being once again open to English\r\ntravellers, the Morgans paid a visit to Paris, Lady Morgan having\r\nundertaken to write a book about what was then a strange people and a\r\nstrange country. The pair went a good deal into society, and made many\r\nfriends, among them Lafayette, Cuvier, the Comte de Ségur, Madame de\r\nGenlis, and Madame Jerome Bonaparte. Sydney, whose Celtic manners were\r\nprobably more congenial to the French than Anglo-Saxon reserve, seems\r\nto have received a great deal of attention, and her not over-strong\r\nhead was slightly turned in consequence.\r\n\r\n'The French admire you more than any Englishwoman who has appeared\r\nhere since the Battle of Waterloo,' wrote Madame Jerome Bonaparte to\r\nLady Morgan, after the latter had returned to Ireland. 'France is the\r\ncountry you should reside in, because you are so much admired, and\r\nhere no Englishwoman has received the same attentions since you. I am\r\ndying to see your last publication. Public expectation is as high as\r\npossible. How happy you must be at filling the world with your name as\r\nyou do! Madame de Staël and Madame de Genlis are forgotten; and if the\r\nlove of fame be of any weight with you, your excursion to Paris was\r\nattended with brilliant success.'\r\n\r\nMadame de Genlis, in her _Memoirs_, gives a more soberly-worded\r\naccount of the impression produced by Lady Morgan on Parisian society.\r\nThe author of _France_ is described as 'not beautiful, but with\r\nsomething lively and agreeable in her whole person. She is very\r\nclever, and seems to have a good heart; it is a pity that for the sake\r\nof popularity she should have the mania of meddling in politics....\r\nHer vivacity and rather springing carriage seemed very strange in\r\nParisian circles. She soon learned that good taste of itself condemned\r\nthat kind of demeanour; in fact, gesticulation and noisy manners have\r\nnever been popular in France.' The spoilt little lady was by no means\r\nsatisfied with this portrait, and Sir Charles, who was away from home\r\nat the time the _Memoirs_ appeared, writes to console her. 'You\r\nmust not mind that lying old witch Madame de Genlis' attack upon you,'\r\nsays the admiring husband. 'I thought she would not let you off\r\neasily; you were not only a better and younger (and _I_ may say\r\n_prettier_) author than herself, but also a more popular one.'\r\n\r\nOver the price to be paid for _France_, to which Sir Charles\r\ncontributed some rather heavy chapters on medical science, political\r\neconomy, and jurisprudence, there was the usual battle between the\r\nkeen little woman and her publisher. Colburn, having done well with\r\n_O'Donnel_, felt justified in offering £750 for the new work, but\r\nLady Morgan demanded £1000, and got it. The sum must have been a\r\nsubstantial compensation for the wounds that her vanity received at\r\nthe hands of the reviewers. _France_, which made its appearance\r\nin 1817, in two volumes quarto, was eagerly read and loudly abused.\r\nCroker, in the _Quarterly Review_, attacked the book, or rather\r\nthe author, in an article which has become almost historic for its\r\nvirulence. Poor Lady Morgan was accused of bad taste, bombast and\r\nnonsense, blunders, ignorance of the French language and manners,\r\ngeneral ignorance, Jacobinism, falsehood, licentiousness, and impiety!\r\nThe first four or five charges might have been proved with little\r\ndifficulty, if it were worth while to break a butterfly on a wheel,\r\nbut it was necessary to distort the meaning and even the text of the\r\noriginal in order to give any colour to the graver accusations.\r\n\r\nCroker had discovered, much to his delight, that the translator of the\r\nwork (which was also published in Paris) had subjoined a note to some\r\nof Lady Morgan's scraps of French, in which he confessed that though\r\nthe words were printed to look like French, he could not understand\r\nthem. The critic observes, _à propos_ of this fact, 'It is, we\r\nbelieve, peculiar to Lady Morgan's works, that her English readers\r\nrequire an English translation of her English, and her French readers\r\na French translation of her French.' This was a fair hit, as also was\r\nthe ridicule thrown upon such sentences as 'Cider is not held in any\r\nestimation by the _véritables Amphitryons_ of rural _savoir\r\nfaire_.' Croker professes to be shocked at Lady Morgan's mention of\r\n_Les Liaisons Dangereuses_, having hitherto cherished the hope\r\nthat 'no British female had ever seen this detestable book'; while his\r\noutburst of virtuous indignation at her mention of the 'superior\r\neffusions' of Parny, which some Frenchman had recommended to her, is\r\nreally superb. 'Parny,' he exclaims, 'is the most beastly, the most\r\ndetestably wicked and blasphemous of all the writers who have ever\r\ndisgraced literature. _Les Guerres des Dieux_ is the most\r\ndreadful tissue of obscenity and depravity that the devil ever\r\ninspired to the depraved heart of man, and we tremble with horror at\r\nthe guilt of having read unwittingly even so much of the work as\r\nenables us to pronounce this character of it.'\r\n\r\nCroker concludes with the hope that he has given such an idea of this\r\nbook as might prevent, in some degree, the circulation of trash which,\r\nunder the name of a '_Lady_ author,' might otherwise have found\r\nits way into the hands of young persons of both sexes, for whose\r\nperusal it was, on the score both of morals and politics, utterly\r\nunfit. Such a notice naturally defeated its own object, and\r\n_France_ went triumphantly through several editions. The review\r\nattracted almost as much attention as the book, and many protests were\r\nraised against it. 'What cruel work you make with Lady Morgan,' wrote\r\nByron to Murray. 'You should recollect that she is a woman; though, to\r\nbe sure, they are now and then very provoking, still as authoresses\r\nthey can do no great harm; and I think it a pity so much good\r\ninvective should have been laid out upon her, when there is such a\r\nfine field of us Jacobin gentlemen for you to work upon.' The Regent\r\nhimself, according to Lady Charleville's report, had said of Croker:\r\n'D----d blackguard to abuse a woman; couldn't he let her _France_\r\nalone, if it be all lies, and read her novels, and thank her, by\r\nJasus, for being a good Irishwoman?'\r\n\r\nLady Morgan, as presently appeared, was not only quite able to defend\r\nherself, but to give as good as she got. Peel, in a letter to Croker,\r\nsays: 'Lady Morgan vows vengeance against you as the supposed author\r\nof the article in the _Quarterly_, in which her atheism, profanity,\r\nindecency, and ignorance are exposed. You are to be the\r\nhero of some novel of which she is about to be delivered. I hope she\r\nhas not heard of your predilection for angling, and that she will not\r\ndescribe you as she describes one of her heroes, as \"seated in his\r\n_piscatory_ corner, intent on the destruction of the finny\r\ntribe.\"' 'Lady Morgan,' it seems, replies Croker, 'is resolved to make\r\nme read one of her novels. I hope I shall feel interested enough to\r\nlearn the language. I wrote the first part of the article in question,\r\nbut was called away to Ireland when it was in the press; and I am\r\nsorry to say that some blunders crept in accidentally, and one or two\r\nwere premeditatedly added, which, however, I do not think Lady Morgan\r\nknows enough of either English, French, or Latin to find out. If she\r\ngoes on, we shall have sport.'\r\n\r\nEarly in 1818 Colburn wrote to suggest that the Morgans should proceed\r\nto Italy with a view to collaborating in a book on that country, and\r\noffered them the handsome sum of £2000 for the copyright. By this time\r\nSir Charles had lost most of his practice, owing to his publication of\r\na scientific work, _The Outlines of the Physiology of Life_,\r\nwhich was considered objectionably heterodox by the Dublin public.\r\nThere was no obstacle, therefore, to his leaving home for a lengthened\r\nperiod, and joining his wife in her literary labours. In May, the pair\r\njourneyed to London _en route_ for the South, Lady Morgan taking\r\nwith her the nearly finished manuscript of a new novel, _Florence\r\nMacarthy_. With his first reading of this book Colburn was so\r\ncharmed, that he presented the author with a fine parure of amethysts\r\nas a tribute of admiration.\r\n\r\nAccording to the testimony of impartial witnesses, Lady Morgan made as\r\ndecided a social success in Italy as she had done a couple of years\r\nearlier in France. Moore, who met the couple in Florence, notes in his\r\ndiary for October 1819: 'Went to see Sir Charles and Lady Morgan; her\r\nsuccess everywhere astonishing. Camac was last night at the Countess\r\nof Albany's (the Pretender's wife and Alfieri's), and saw Lady Morgan\r\nthere in the seat of honour, quite the queen of the room.' In Rome the\r\nsame appreciation awaited her. 'The Duchess of Devonshire,' writes her\r\nladyship, 'is unceasing in her attentions. Cardinal Fesche\r\n(Bonaparte's uncle) is quite my beau.... Madame Mère (Napoleon's\r\nmother) sent to say she would be glad to see me; we were received\r\nquite in an imperial style. I never saw so fine an old lady--still\r\nquite handsome. The pictures of her sons hung round the room, all in\r\nroyal robes, and her daughters and grandchildren, and at the head of\r\nthem all, _old Mr. Bonaparte_. She is full of sense, feeling, and\r\nspirit, and not the least what I expected--vulgar.'\r\n\r\n_Florence Macarthy_ was published during its author's absence\r\nabroad. The heroine, Lady Clancare, a novelist and politician, a\r\nbeauty and a wit, is obviously intended for Lady Morgan herself, while\r\nLady Abercorn figures again under the title of Lady Dunore. But the\r\nmost striking of all the character-portraits is Counsellor Con\r\nCrawley, who was sketched from Lady Morgan's old enemy, John Wilson\r\nCroker. According to Moore, Croker winced more under this caricature\r\nthan under any of the direct attacks which were made upon him. Con\r\nCrawley, we are told, was of a bilious, saturnine constitution, even\r\nhis talent being but the result of disease. These physical\r\ndisadvantages, combined with an education 'whose object was\r\npretension, and whose principle was arrogance, made him at once a\r\nthing fearful and pitiable, at war with its species and itself, ready\r\nto crush in manhood as to sting in the cradle, and leading his\r\noverweening ambition to pursue its object by ways dark and\r\nhidden--safe from the penalty of crime, and exposed only to the\r\nobloquy which he laughed to scorn. If ever there was a man formed\r\nalike by nature and education to betray the land which gave him birth,\r\nand to act openly as the pander of political corruption, or secretly\r\nas the agent of defamation; who would stoop to seek his fortune by\r\neffecting the fall of a frail woman, or would strive to advance it by\r\nstabbing the character of an honest one; who could crush aspiring\r\nmerit behind the ambuscade of anonymous security, while he came\r\nforward openly in defence of the vileness which rank sanctified and\r\ninfluence protected--that man was Conway Crawley.'\r\n\r\nThe truth of the portraiture of the whole Crawley family--exaggerated\r\nas it may seem in modern eyes--was at once recognised by Lady Morgan's\r\ncountrymen. Sir Jonah Barrington, an undisputed authority on Irish\r\nmanners and character, writes: 'The Crawleys are superlative, and\r\nsuffice to bring before my vision, in their full colouring, and almost\r\nwithout a variation, persons and incidents whom and which I have many\r\na time encountered.' Again, Owen Maddyn, who was by no means\r\nprejudiced in Lady Morgan's favour, admits that her attack on Croker\r\nhad much effect in its day, and was written on the model of the Irish\r\nschool of invective furnished by Flood and Grattan. As a novelist, he\r\nheld that she pointed the way to Lever, and adds: 'The rattling\r\nvivacity of the Irish character, its ebullient spirit, and its\r\nwrathful eloquence of sentiment and language, she well portrayed; one\r\ncan smell the potheen and turf smoke even in her pictures of a\r\nboudoir.' In this sentence are summed up the leading characteristics,\r\nnot only of _Florence Macarthy_, but of all Lady Morgan's\r\nnational romances.\r\n\r\n_Italy_ was published simultaneously in London and Paris in June,\r\n1821, and produced an even greater sensation than the work on France,\r\nthough Croker declared that it fell dead from the press, and devoted\r\nthe greater part of his 'review' in the _Quarterly_ to an\r\nanalysis of Colburn's methods of advertisement. Criticism of a penal\r\nkind, he explained, was not called for, because, 'in the first place,\r\nwe are convinced that this woman is wholly _incorrigible_;\r\nsecondly, we hope that her indelicacy, vanity, and malignity are\r\ninimitable, and that, therefore, her example is very little dangerous;\r\nand thirdly, though every page teems with errors of all kinds, from\r\nthe most disgusting to the most ludicrous, they are smothered in such\r\nBoeotian dulness that they can do no harm.' In curious contrast to\r\nthis professional criticism is a passage in one of Byron's letters to\r\nMoore. 'Lady Morgan,' writes the poet, 'in a _really excellent_\r\nbook, I assure you, on Italy, calls Venice an ocean Rome; I have the\r\nvery same expression in _Foscari_, and yet you know that the play\r\nwas written months ago, and sent to England; the _Italy_ I\r\nreceived only on the 16th.... When you write to Lady Morgan, will you\r\nthank her for her handsome speeches in her book about _my_ books?\r\nHer work is fearless and excellent on the subject of Italy--pray tell\r\nher so--and I know the country. I wish she had fallen in with\r\n_me_; I could have told her a thing or two that would have\r\nconfirmed her positions.'\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the appearance of _Italy_, Colburn\r\nprinted in his _New Monthly Magazine_ a long, vehement, and\r\nrather incoherent attack by Lady Morgan upon her critics. The editor,\r\nThomas Campbell, explained in an indignant letter to the _Times_,\r\nthat the article had been inserted by the proprietor without being\r\nfirst submitted to the editorial eye, and that he was in no way\r\nresponsible for its contents. Colburn also wrote to the _Times_\r\nto refute the _Quarterly_ reviewer's statements regarding the\r\nsales of _Italy_, and publicly to declare his entire satisfaction\r\nat the result of the undertaking, and his willingness to receive from\r\nthe author another work of equal interest on the same terms. In short,\r\nnever was a book worse reviewed or better advertised.\r\n\r\nThe next venture of the indefatigable Lady Morgan, who felt herself\r\ncapable of dealing with any subject, no matter how little she might\r\nknow of it, was a _Life of Salvator Rosa_. This, which was her\r\nown favourite among all her books, is a rather imaginative work, which\r\nhardly comes up to modern biographical standards. The author seems to\r\nhave been influenced in her choice of a subject rather by the\r\npatriotic character of Salvator Rosa than by his artistic attainments.\r\nLady Morgan was once asked by a fellow-writer where she got her facts,\r\nto which she replied, 'We all imagine our facts, you know--and then\r\nhappily forget them; it is to be hoped our readers do the same.'\r\nNevertheless, she seems to have taken a good deal of trouble to 'get\r\nup' the material for her biography; it was in her treatment of it that\r\nshe sometimes allowed her ardent Celtic imagination to run away with\r\nher. About this time Colburn proposed that Sir Charles and Lady Morgan\r\nshould contribute to his magazine, _The New Monthly_, and offered\r\nthem half as much again as his other writers, who were paid at the\r\nrate of sixteen guineas a sheet. For this periodical Lady Morgan wrote\r\na long essay on _Absenteeism_ and other articles, some of which\r\nwere afterwards republished.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1824 the Morgans came to London for the season, and\r\nwent much into the literary society that was dear to both their\r\nhearts. Lady Caroline Lamb took a violent fancy to Lady Morgan, to\r\nwhom she confided her Byronic love-troubles, while Lady Cork, who\r\nstill maintained a salon, did not neglect her old _protégée_. The\r\nrough notes kept by Lady Morgan of her social adventures are not\r\nusually of much interest or importance, as she had little faculty or\r\ninclination for Boswellising, but the following entry is worth\r\nquoting:--\r\n\r\n'Lady Cork said to me this morning when I called Miss ---- a nice\r\nperson, \"Don't say nice, child, 'tis a bad word.\" Once I said to Dr.\r\nJohnson, \"Sir, that is a very nice person.\" \"A _nice_ person,\" he\r\nreplied; \"what does that mean? Elegant is now the fashionable term,\r\nbut it will go out, and I see this stupid _nice_ is to succeed to\r\nit. What does nice mean? Look in my Dictionary; you will see it means\r\ncorrect, precise.\"'\r\n\r\nAt Lydia White's famous _soirées_ Lady Morgan met Sydney Smith,\r\nWashington Irving, Hallam, Miss Jane Porter, Anacreon Moore, and many\r\nother literary celebrities. Her own rooms were thronged with a band of\r\nyoung Italian revolutionaries, whose country had grown too hot to hold\r\nthem, and who talked of erecting a statue to the liberty-loving\r\nIrishwoman when Italy should be free. Dublin naturally seemed rather\r\ndull after all the excitement and delights of a London season, but\r\nLady Morgan, though she loved to grumble at her native city, had not\r\nyet thought of turning absentee herself. Her popularity with her\r\ncountrymen (those of her own way of thinking) had suffered no\r\ndiminution, and her national celebrity was proved by the following\r\nverse from a ballad which was sung in the Dublin streets:--\r\n\r\n   'Och, Dublin's city, there's no doubtin',\r\n     Bates every city on the say;\r\n   'Tis there you'll hear O'Connell spoutin',\r\n     And Lady Morgan making tay;\r\n   For 'tis the capital of the finest nation,\r\n     Wid charmin' peasantry on a fruitful sod,\r\n   Fightin' like divils for conciliation,\r\n     An' hatin' each other for the love of God.'\r\n\r\nOur heroine was hard at work at this time upon the last of her Irish\r\nnovels, _The O'Briens and the O'Flaherties_, which was published\r\nearly in 1827, and for the copyright of which Colburn paid her £1350.\r\nIt was the most popular of all her works, especially with her own\r\ncountry-folk, and is distinguished by her favourite blend of politics,\r\nmelodrama, local colour, and rough satire on the ruling classes. The\r\nreviews as usual accused her of blasphemy and indecency, and so severe\r\nwas the criticism in the _Literary Gazette_, then edited by\r\nJerdan, that Colburn was stirred up to found a new literary weekly of\r\nhis own, and, in conjunction with James Silk Buckingham, started the\r\n_Athenaeum_. Jerdan had asserted in the course of his review that 'In\r\nall our reading we never met with a description which tended so\r\nthoroughly to lower the female character.... Mrs. Behn and Mrs.\r\nCentlivre might be more unguarded; but the gauze veil cannot hide the\r\ndeformities, and Lady Morgan's taste has not been of efficient power\r\nto filter into cleanliness the original pollution of her infected\r\nfountain.' Lady Morgan observes in her diary that she has a right to\r\nbe judged by her peers, and threatens to summon a jury of matrons to\r\nsay if they can detect one line in her pages that would tend to make\r\nany honest man her foe.\r\n\r\nThere were other disadvantages attendant upon celebrity than those\r\ncaused by inimical reviewers. No foreigner of distinction thought a\r\nvisit to Dublin complete without an introduction to our author, who\r\nfigures in several contemporary memoirs, not always in a flattering\r\nlight. That curious personage, Prince Pückler Muskau, was travelling\r\nthrough England and Ireland in 1828, and has left a little vignette of\r\nLady Morgan in the published record of his journey. 'I was very\r\neager,' he explains, 'to make the acquaintance of a lady whom I rate\r\nso highly as an authoress. I found her, however, very different from\r\nwhat I had pictured to myself. She is a little, frivolous, lively\r\nwoman, apparently between thirty and forty, neither pretty nor ugly,\r\nbut by no means inclined to resign all claims to the former, and with\r\nreally fine expressive eyes. She has no idea of _mauvaise honte_\r\nor embarrassment; her manners are not the most refined, and affect the\r\n_aisance_ and levity of the fashionable world, which, however, do\r\nnot sit calmly or naturally upon her. She has the English weakness of\r\ntalking incessantly of fashionable acquaintances, and trying to pose\r\nfor very _recherché_, to a degree quite unworthy of a woman of\r\nsuch distinguished talents; she is not at all aware how she thus\r\nunderrates herself.' The _Quarterly Review_ seized upon this\r\npassage with malicious delight. The prince, as the reviewer points\r\nout, had dropped one lump of sugar into his bowl of gall; he had\r\nguessed Lady Morgan's age at between thirty and forty.' Miss Owenson,'\r\ncomments the writer, who was probably Croker, 'was an established\r\nauthoress six-and-twenty years ago; and if any lady, player's daughter\r\nor not, knew what _she_ knew when she published her first work at\r\neight or nine years of age (which Miss Owenson must have been at that\r\ntime according to the prince's calculation), she was undoubtedly such\r\na juvenile prodigy as would be quite worthy to make a _case_ for\r\nthe _Gentleman's Magazine_.'\r\n\r\nAnother observer, who was present at some of the Castle festivities,\r\nand who had long pictured Lady Morgan in imagination as a sylphlike\r\nand romantic person, has left on record his amazement when the\r\ncelebrated lady stood before him. 'She certainly formed a strange\r\nfigure in the midst of that dazzling scene of beauty and splendour.\r\nEvery female present wore feathers and trains; but Lady Morgan scorned\r\nboth appendages. Hardly more than four feet high, with a spine not\r\nquite straight, slightly uneven shoulders and eyes, Lady Morgan glided\r\nabout in a close-cropped wig, bound with a fillet of gold, her large\r\nface all animation, and with a witty word for everybody. I afterwards\r\nsaw her at the theatre, where she was cheered enthusiastically. Her\r\ndress was different from the former occasion, but not less original. A\r\nred Celtic cloak, fastened by a rich gold fibula, or Irish Tara\r\nbrooch, imparted to her little ladyship a gorgeous and withal a\r\npicturesque appearance, which antecedent associations considerably\r\nstrengthened.'\r\n\r\nIn 1829 _The Book of the Boudoir_ was published, with a preface\r\nin which Lady Morgan gives the following naïve account of its genesis:\r\n'I was just setting off to Ireland--the horses literally\r\nputting-to--when Mr. Colburn arrived with his flattering proposition\r\n[for a new book]. Taking up a scrubby manuscript volume which the\r\nservant was about to thrust into the pocket of the carriage, he asked\r\nwhat was that. I said it was one of my volumes of odds and ends, and\r\nread him my last entry. \"This is the very thing,\" he said, and carried\r\nit off with him.' The book was correctly described as a volume of odds\r\nand ends, and was hardly worth preserving in a permanent shape, though\r\nit contains one or two interesting autobiographical scraps, such as\r\nthe account of _My First Rout_, from which a quotation has\r\nalready been given. A writer in _Blackwood_ reviewed the work in\r\na vein of ironical admiration, professing to be much impressed by the\r\nauthor's knowledge of metaphysics as exemplified in such a sentence\r\nas: 'The idea of cause is a consequence of our consciousness of the\r\nforce we exert in subjecting externals to the changes dictated by our\r\nvolition.' Unable to keep up the laudatory strain, even in joke, the\r\nreviewer (his style points to Christopher North) calls a literary\r\nfriend to his assistance, who takes the opposite view, and declares\r\nthat the book is 'a tawdry tissue of tedious trumpery; a tessellated\r\ntexture of threadbare thievery; a trifling transcript of trite twaddle\r\nand trapessing tittle-tattle.... Like everything that falls from her\r\npen, it is pert, shallow, and conceited, a farrago of ignorance,\r\nindecency, and blasphemy, a tag-rag and bob-tail style of\r\nwriting--like a harlequin's jacket.'\r\n\r\nLady Morgan bobbed up as irrepressibly as ever from under this torrent\r\nof (so-called) criticism, made a tour in France and Belgium for the\r\npurpose of writing more 'trapessing tittle-tattle,' and on her return\r\nto London, such were the profits on blasphemy and indecency, bought\r\nher first carriage. This equipage was a source of much amusement to\r\nher friends in Dublin, 'Neither she nor Sir Charles,' we are told,\r\n'knew the difference between a good carriage and a bad one--a carriage\r\nwas a carriage to them. It was never known where this vehicle was\r\nbought, except that Lady Morgan declared it came from the first\r\ncarriage-builder in London. In shape it was like a grasshopper, as\r\nwell as in colour. Very high and very springy, with enormous wheels,\r\nit was difficult to get into, and dangerous to get out of. Sir\r\nCharles, who never in his life before had mounted a coach-box, was\r\npersuaded by his wife to drive his own carriage. He was extremely\r\nshort-sighted, and wore large green spectacles out of doors. His\r\ncostume was a coat much trimmed with fur, and heavily braided. James\r\nGrant, the tall Irish footman, in the brightest of red plush, sat\r\nbeside him, his office being to jump down whenever anybody was knocked\r\ndown, or run over, for Sir Charles drove as it pleased God. The horse\r\nwas mercifully a very quiet animal, and much too small for the\r\ncarriage, or the mischief would have been worse. Lady Morgan, in the\r\nlarge bonnet of the period, and a cloak lined with fur hanging over\r\nthe back of the carriage, gave, as she conceived, the crowning grace\r\nto a neat and elegant turn-out. The only drawback to her satisfaction\r\nwas the alarm caused by Sir Charles's driving; and she was incessantly\r\nspringing up to adjure him to take care, to which he would reply with\r\nwarmth, after the manner of husbands.'\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Lady Morgan published her _France_ (1829-30). This book\r\nwas not a commission, but she had told Colburn that she was writing\r\nit, and as he made her no definite offer, she opened negotiations with\r\nthe firm of Saunders and Otley. Colburn, who looked upon her as his\r\nspecial property, was furious at her desertion, and informed her that\r\nif she did not at once break off with Saunders and Otley, it would be\r\nno less detrimental to her literary than to her pecuniary interest.\r\nUndismayed by this threat, Lady Morgan accepted the offer of a\r\nthousand pounds made her by the rival firm. Colburn, who was a power\r\nin the literary market, kept his word. He advertised in his own\r\nperiodicals 'LADY MORGAN AT HALF-PRICE,' and stated publicly that in\r\nconsequence of the losses he had sustained by her former works, he had\r\ndeclined her new book, and that copies of all her publications might\r\nbe had at half-price. In consequence of these and other machinations,\r\nthe new _France_, which was at least as good a book as the old\r\none, fell flat, and the unfortunate publishers were only able to make\r\none payment of £500. They tried to get their contract cancelled in\r\ncourt, and Colburn, who was called as a witness, admitted that he had\r\ndone his best to injure Lady Morgan's literary reputation. Eventually,\r\nthe matter was compromised, Saunders and Otley being allowed to\r\npublish Lady Morgan's next book, _Dramatic Scenes and Sketches_,\r\nas some compensation for their loss; but of this, too, they failed to\r\nmake a success.\r\n\r\nThe reviews of _France_ were few and slighting, the wickedest and\r\nmost amusing being by Theodore Hook. He quotes with glee the author's\r\ncomplacent record that she was compared to Molière by the Parisians,\r\nand that she had seen in a 'poetry-book' the following lines:--\r\n\r\n   'Slendal (_sic_), Morgan, Schlegel-ne vous effrayez pas--\r\n   Muses! ce sont des noms fameux dans nos climats.'\r\n\r\n'Her ladyship,' continues Theodore, 'went to dine with one of those\r\nspectacle and sealing-wax barons, Rothschild, at Paris; where never\r\nwas such a dinner, \"no catsup and walnut pickle, but a mayonese fried\r\nin ice, like Ninon's description of Seveigne's (_sic_) heart,\"\r\nand to all this fine show she was led out by Rothschild himself. After\r\nthe soup she took an opportunity of praising the cook, of whom she had\r\nheard much. \"Eh bien,\" says Rothschild, laughing, as well he might,\r\n\"he on his side has also relished your works, and here is a proof of\r\nit.\" \"I really blush,\" says Miladi, \"like Sterne's accusing spirit, as\r\nI give in the fact--but--he pointed to a column of the most ingenious\r\nconfectionery architecture, on which my name was inscribed in spun\r\nsugar.\" There was a thing--Lady Morgan in spun sugar! And what does\r\nthe reader think her ladyship did? She shall tell in her own dear\r\nwords. \"All I could do under my triumphant emotion I did. I begged to\r\nbe introduced to the celebrated and flattering artist.\" It is a\r\nfact--to the cook; and another fact, which only shows that the Hebrew\r\nbaron is a Jew _d'esprit_, is that after coffee, the cook\r\nactually came up, and was presented to her. \"He,\" says her ladyship,\r\n\"was a well-bred gentleman, perfectly free from pedantry, and when we\r\nhad mutually complimented each other on our respective works, he bowed\r\nhimself out.\"'\r\n\r\nIn spite of her egoism and her many absurdities, it seems clear from\r\ncontemporary evidence that in London, where she usually appeared\r\nduring the season, Lady Morgan had a following. The names of most of\r\nthe literary celebrities of the day appear amid the disjointed\r\njottings of her diary. We hear of 'that egregious coxcomb D'Israeli,\r\noutraging the privilege a young man has of being absurd'; and Sydney\r\nSmith 'so natural, so _bon enfant_, so little of a wit _titré_';\r\nand Mrs. Bulwer-Lytton, handsome, insolent, and unamiable; and\r\nAllan Cunningham, 'immense fun'; and Thomas Hood, 'a grave-looking\r\npersonage, the picture of ill-health'; and her old critical enemy,\r\nLord Jeffrey, with whom Lady Morgan started a violent flirtation.\r\n'When he comes to Ireland,' she writes, 'we are to go to Donnybrook\r\nFair together; in short, having cut me down with his tomahawk as\r\na reviewer, he smothers me with roses as a man. I always say of\r\nmy enemies before we meet, \"Let me at them.\"'\r\n\r\nThe other literary women were naturally the chief object of interest\r\nto her. Lady Morgan seems to have been fairly free from professional\r\njealousy, though she hated her countrywoman, Lady Blessington, with a\r\ndeadly hatred. Mrs. Gore, then one of the most fashionable novelists,\r\nshe finds 'a pleasant little _rondelette_ of a woman, something\r\nof my own style. We talked and laughed together, as good-natured women\r\ndo, and agreed upon many points.' The learned Mrs. Somerville is\r\ndescribed as 'a simple, little, middle-aged woman. Had she not been\r\npresented to me by name and reputation, I should have said she was one\r\nof the respectable twaddling matrons one meets at every ball, dressed\r\nin a snug mulberry velvet gown, and a little cap with a red flower. I\r\nasked her how she could descend from the stars to mix among us. She\r\nsaid she was obliged to go out with a daughter. From the glimpse of\r\nher last night, I should say there was no imagination, no deep moral\r\nphilosophy, though a great deal of scientific lore, and a great deal\r\nof _bonhomie_.' For 'poor dear Jane Porter,' the author of\r\n_Scottish Chiefs_, Lady Morgan felt the natural contempt of a\r\n'showy woman' for one who looks like a 'shabby canoness.' 'Miss\r\nPorter,' she records, 'told me she was taken for me the other night,\r\nand talked to _as such_ by a party of Americans. She is tall,\r\nlank, lean, and lackadaisical, dressed in the deepest black, with a\r\nbattered black gauze hat, and the air of a regular Melpomene. I am the\r\nreverse of all this, and _sans vanité_, the best-dressed woman\r\nwherever I go. Last night I wore a blue satin, trimmed fully with\r\nmagnificent point-lace, and stomacher _à la Sévigné_, light blue\r\nvelvet hat and feathers, with an aigrette of sapphires and diamonds.'\r\nAs Lady Morgan at this time was nearer sixty than fifty, rouged\r\nliberally, and made all her own dresses, her appearance in the costume\r\nabove described must at least have been remarkable.\r\n\r\nLady Morgan's last novel, a Belgian story called _The Princess, or\r\nthe Béguine_, was published by Bentley in 1834, and for the first\r\nedition she received, £350, a sad falling-off from the prices received\r\nin former days. As her popularity waned, she grew discontented with\r\nlife in Dublin, 'the wretched capital of wretched Ireland,' as she\r\ncalls it, and in a moment of mental depression she entered the\r\ncharacteristic query,'_Cui bono?_' in her diary. To the same\r\nfaithful volume she confided complaints even of her beloved Morgan,\r\nbut the fact that she could find nothing worse to reproach him with\r\nthan a disinclination for fresh air and exercise, speaks volumes for\r\nhis marital virtue. A more serious trouble came from failing eyesight,\r\nwhich in 1837 threatened to develop into total blindness. It was in\r\nthis year, when things seemed at their darkest, that a pension of £300\r\na year was conferred on her by Lord Melbourne, 'in recognition of her\r\nmerits, literary and patriotic.' It was probably this unexpected\r\naccession of income that decided the Morgans to leave Dublin, and\r\nspend the remainder of their days in London. They found a pleasant\r\nlittle house in William Street, Knightsbridge, a new residential\r\nquarter which was just growing up under the fostering care of Mr.\r\nCubitt. Lady Morgan went 'into raptures over the pretty new quarter,'\r\nand wrote some articles on Pimlico in the _Athenæum_. She also\r\ngot up a successful agitation for an entrance into Hyde Park at what\r\nis now known as Albert Gate. For deserting Ireland, after receiving a\r\npension for patriotism, and writing against the evils of Absenteeism,\r\nLady Morgan was subjected to a good deal of sarcasm by her countrymen.\r\nBut, as she pointed out, her property in Ireland was personal, not\r\nreal, the tenant-farm of a drawing-room balcony, on which annual crops\r\nof mignonette were raised for home consumption, being the only\r\nterritorial possession that she had ever enjoyed.\r\n\r\nLady Morgan's eyesight must have temporarily improved with her change\r\nof dwelling, for in 1839 the first part of her last work of any\r\nimportance, _Woman and her Master_, was published by Colburn, to\r\nwhom she had at last become reconciled. This book, which was never\r\nfinished, was designed to prove, among other things, that in spite of\r\nthe subordination in which women have been kept, and in spite of all\r\nthe artificial difficulties that have been put in their way, not only\r\nhave they never been conquered in spirit, but that they have always\r\nbeen the depositaries of the vital and leading ideas of the time. The\r\nbook is more soberly written than most of Lady Morgan's works, but it\r\nwould probably be regarded by the modern reader as dull and\r\nsuperficial. It was generally believed that Sir Charles had assisted\r\nin its composition, and few men have ever wielded a heavier pen. The\r\npair only issued one more joint work, _The Book Without a Name_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1842, and consisted chiefly of articles and sketches\r\nthat had already been published in the magazines.\r\n\r\nThe Morgans now found their chief occupation and amusement in the\r\nsociety which they attracted to their cheerful little house. One or\r\ntwo sketches of the pair, as they appeared in their later days, have\r\nbeen left by contemporaries. Chorley, an intimate friend, observes\r\nthat, like all the sceptics he ever approached, they were absurdly\r\nprejudiced, and proof against all new impressions. 'Neither of them,\r\nthough both were literary and musical, could endure German literature\r\nand music, had got beyond the stale sarcasms of the _Anti-Jacobin_,\r\nor could admit that there is glory for such men as Weber, Beethoven,\r\nand Mendelssohn, as well as for Cimarosa and Paisiello....\r\nHer familiar conversation was a series of brilliant, egotistic,\r\nshrewd, and genial sallies, and she could be either caressing\r\nor impudent. In the matter of self-approbation she had no\r\nStatute of Limitation, but boasted of having taught Taglioni to dance\r\nan Irish jig, and declared that she had created the Irish novel,\r\nthough in the next breath she would say that she was a child when Miss\r\nEdgeworth was a grown woman.' Her blunders were proverbial, as when\r\nshe asked in all simplicity, 'Who was Jeremy Taylor?' and on being\r\npresented to Mrs. Sarah Austin, complimented her on having written\r\n_Pride and Prejudice_.\r\n\r\nAnother friend, Abraham Hayward, used to say that Lady Morgan had been\r\ntransplanted to London too late, and that she was never free of the\r\ncorporation of fine ladies, though she saw a good deal of them. 'She\r\nerroneously fancied that she was expected to entertain the company, be\r\nit what it might, and she was fond of telling stories in which she\r\nfigured as the companion of the great, instead of confining herself to\r\nscenes of low Irish life, which she described inimitably. Lady Cork\r\nwas accustomed to say, \"I like Lady Morgan very much as an Irish\r\nblackguard, but I can't endure her as an English fine lady.\"'\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Sir Charles died rather suddenly from heart disease. His wife\r\nmourned him sincerely, but not for long in solitude. She found the\r\nanaesthetic for her grief in society, and after a few months of\r\nwidowhood writes: 'Everybody makes a point of having me out, and I am\r\nbeginning to be familiarised with my great loss. London is the best\r\nplace in the world for the happy and the unhappy; there is a floating\r\ncapital of sympathy for every human good or evil. I am a nobody, and\r\nyet what kindness I am daily receiving.' Again, in 1845, after her\r\nsister's death, she notes in her diary: 'The world is my gin or opium;\r\nI take it for a few hours _per diem_--excitement, intoxication,\r\nabsence. I return to my desolate home, and wake to all the horrors of\r\nsobriety.... Yet I am accounted the agreeable rattle of the great\r\nladies' coterie, and I talk _pas mal_ to many clever men all\r\nday.... That Park near me, of which my beloved Morgan used to say, \"It\r\nis ours more than the Queen's, we use it daily and enjoy it\r\nnightly\"--that Park that I worked so hard to get an entrance into, I\r\nnever walk in it; it seems to me covered with crape.'\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of Lady Morgan's old age were the Carter Halls,\r\nHepworth Dixon, Miss Jewsbury, Hayward, and Douglas Jerrold. Lord\r\nCampbell, old Rogers, and Cardinal Wiseman frequented her\r\n_soirées_, though with the last-named she had waged a pamphlet\r\nwar over the authenticity of St. Peter's chair at Rome. Rogers was\r\nreported to be engaged to one of Lady Morgan's attractive nieces, the\r\nMiss Clarkes, who often stayed with her. It was in allusion to this\r\nrumour that he said, 'Whenever my name is coupled with that of a young\r\nlady in this manner, I make it a point of honour to say I have been\r\nrefused.' To the last, we are told, Lady Morgan preserved the natural\r\nvivacity and aptness of repartee that had made her the delight of\r\nDublin society half a century before. 'I know I am vain,' she said\r\nonce to Mrs. Hall, 'but I have a right to be. It is not put on and off\r\nlike my rouge; it is always with me.... I wrote books when your\r\nmothers worked samplers, and demanded freedom for Ireland when Dan\r\nO'Connell scrambled for gulls' eggs in the crags of Derrynane.... Look\r\nat the number of books I have written. Did ever woman move in a\r\nbrighter sphere than I do? I have three invitations to dinner to-day,\r\none from a duchess, one from a countess, and the third from a\r\ndiplomatist, a very witty man, who keeps the best society in London.'\r\n\r\nLady Morgan was fond of boasting that she had supported herself since\r\nshe was fourteen (for which read seventeen or eighteen), and insisted\r\non the advantage of giving every girl a profession by which she could\r\nearn her living, if the need arose. Speaking to Mrs. Hall on the\r\nsubject of some girls who had been suddenly bereft of fortune, she\r\nexclaimed: 'They do everything that is fashionable imperfectly; their\r\ndrawing, singing, dancing, and languages amount to nothing. They were\r\neducated to marry, and had they had time, they might have gone off\r\nwith, and hereafter _from_, husbands. I desire to give every\r\ngirl, no matter her rank, a trade or profession. Cultivate what is\r\nnecessary to the position she is born to; cultivate all things in\r\nmoderation, but one thing to perfection, no matter what it is, for\r\nwhich she has a talent: give her a staff to lay hold of; let her feel,\r\n\"This will carry me through life without dependence.\"'\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of Miss Jewsbury Lady Morgan, in the last years of\r\nher life, prepared a volume of reminiscences, which she called _The\r\nOdd Volume_. This, which was published in 1859, only deals with a\r\nshort period of her career, and is of little literary interest. The\r\n_Athenæum_, in the course of a laudatory review, observed that\r\n'Lady Morgan had lived through the love, admiration, and malignity of\r\nthree generations of men, and was, in short, a literary Ninon, who\r\nseemed as brisk and captivating in the year 1859 as when George was\r\nPrince, and the author of \"Kate Kearney\" divided the laureateship of\r\nsociety and song with Tom Moore.'\r\n\r\nLady Morgan, though now an octogenarian, was by no means pleased at\r\nthese remarks. She still prided herself on her fascinations, was never\r\ntired and never bored, and looked upon any one who died under a\r\nhundred years of age as a suicide. 'You have more strength and spirit,\r\nas well as more genius, than any of us,' wrote Abraham Hayward to her.\r\n'We must go back to the brilliant women of the eighteenth century to\r\nfind anything like a parallel to you and your _soirées_.' But\r\nbronchitis was an enemy with which even her high spirit was powerless\r\nto cope. She had an attack in 1858, but threw it off, and on Christmas\r\nDay gave a dinner, at which she told Irish stories with all her old\r\nvivacity, and sang 'The Night before Larry was Stretched.' On St.\r\nPatrick's Day, 1859, she gave a musical matinée, but caught cold the\r\nfollowing week, and after a short illness, died on April 16th.\r\n\r\nThus ended the career of one of the most flattered and best abused\r\nwomen of the century. Held up as the Irish Madame de Staël by her\r\nadmirers, and run down as a monster of impudence and iniquity by her\r\nenemies, it is no wonder that her character, by no means innately\r\nrefined, became hardened, if not coarsened, by so unenviable a\r\nnotoriety. Still, to her credit be it remembered that she never lost a\r\nfriend, and that she converted more than one impersonal enmity (as in\r\nthe case of Jeffrey and Lockhart) into a personal friendship. In spite\r\nof her passion for the society of the great, she wrote and worked\r\nthroughout her whole career for the cause of liberty, and she was ever\r\non the side of the oppressed. An incorrigible flirt before marriage,\r\nshe developed into an irreproachable matron, while her natural\r\nfrivolity and feather-headedness never tempted her to neglect her\r\nwork, nor interfered with her faculty for making most advantageous\r\nbusiness arrangements. 'With all her frank vanity,' we are told, 'she\r\nhad shrewd good sense, and she valued herself much more on her\r\nindustry than on her genius, because the one, she said, she owed to\r\nher organisation, but the other was a virtue of her own rearing.' It\r\nwould be impossible to conclude a sketch of Lady Morgan more\r\nappropriately than by the following lines of Leigh Hunt, which she\r\nherself was fond of quoting, and in which her personal idiosyncrasies\r\nare pleasantly touched off:--\r\n\r\n     'And dear Lady Morgan, see, see, when she comes,\r\n     With her pulses all beating for freedom like drums,\r\n     So Irish, so modish, so mixtish, so wild;\r\n     So committing herself as she talks--like a child.\r\n     So trim, yet so easy--polite, yet high-hearted,\r\n     That truth and she, try all she can, won't be parted;\r\n     She'll put you your fashions, your latest new air,\r\n     And then talk so frankly, she'll make you all stare.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nathaniel Parker Willis]\r\n\r\nAny fool, said a wise man, can write an interesting book if he will\r\nonly take the trouble to set down exactly what he has seen and heard.\r\nUnfortunately, it is only a very special kind of fool who is capable\r\nof recording exactly what he sees and hears--a rare bird who\r\nflourishes perhaps once in a century, and is remembered long after\r\nwiser men are forgotten. It is not contended that the subject of this\r\nmemoir was a fool in the crude sense of the word, though he was\r\nresponsible for a good deal of folly; but he was inspired by that\r\nimpertinent curiosity, that happy lack of dignity, and that passion\r\nfor the trivial and the intimate, which, when joined to a natural\r\ntalent for observation and a picturesque narrative style, enable the\r\npossessor to illuminate a circle and a period in a fashion never\r\nachieved by the most learned lucubrations of the profoundest scholars.\r\nThanks to his Boswellising powers, 'Namby-Pamby Willis,' as he was\r\ncalled by his numerous enemies, has left an admirably vivid picture of\r\nthe literary society of London in the 'thirties,' a picture that\r\nsteadily increases in value as the period at which it was painted\r\nrecedes into the past.\r\n\r\nWillis came of a family that had contrived, not unsuccessfully, to\r\ncombine religion with journalism. His immediate forebears seem to have\r\nbeen persons of marked individuality, and his pedigree was, for the\r\nNew World, of quite respectable antiquity. The founder of the family,\r\nGeorge Willis, was born early in the seventeenth century, and\r\nemigrated to New England about 1730, where he worked at his trade of\r\nbrickmaking and building. Our hero's great-grandfather was a patriotic\r\nsailmaker, who assisted at a certain historic entertainment, when tar,\r\nfeathers, and hot tea were administered gratis to his Majesty's\r\ntax-collector at Boston. His wife, Abigail, was a lady of character\r\nand maxims, who saved some tea for her private use when three hundred\r\ncases were emptied into Boston Harbour, and exhorted her family never\r\nto eat brown bread when they could get white, and never to go in at\r\nthe back door when they might go in at the front. The son of this\r\nworthy couple conducted a Whig newspaper in Boston during the\r\nRebellion, and became one of the pioneer journalists of the West. His\r\nson, Nathaniel's sire, was invited, in 1803, to start a newspaper at\r\nPortland, Maine, where the future Penciller was born in 1806, one year\r\nbefore his fellow-townsman Longfellow.\r\n\r\nA few years later, Mr. Willis returned to Boston, where, in 1816, he\r\nstarted the _Boston Recorder_, the first newspaper, he was\r\naccustomed to say, that had ever been run on religious lines. He seems\r\nto have been a respectable, but narrow-minded man, who loved long\r\ndevotions and many services, and looked upon dancing, card-playing and\r\nstage-plays as works of the Evil One. His redeeming points were a\r\nsense of humour and a keen appreciation of female beauty, which last\r\ncharacteristic he certainly bequeathed to his son. It was his custom\r\nto sit round the fire with his nine children on winter evenings, and\r\ntell them stories about the old Dutch tiles, representing New\r\nTestament scenes, with which the chimney-corner was lined. The success\r\nof these informal Scripture lessons led him to establish a religious\r\npaper for young people called _The Youth's Companion_, in which\r\nsome of our hero's early verses appeared. His wife, Hannah Parker, is\r\ndescribed as a charming woman, lively, impulsive, and emotional. Her\r\nson, Nathaniel, whose devotion to her never wavered, used to say, 'My\r\nveins are teeming with the quicksilver spirit my mother gave me.'\r\n\r\nWillis the younger was sent to school at Boston, where he had Emerson\r\nfor a schoolfellow, and afterwards to the university of Yale, where he\r\nwrote much poetry, and was well received in the society of the place\r\non account of his good looks, easy manners, and precocious literary\r\nreputation. On leaving Yale, he was delivered of a volume of juvenile\r\npoems, and then settled down in Boston to four years' journalistic\r\nwork. Samuel Goodrich, better known in England under his pseudonym of\r\n'Peter Parley,' engaged him to edit some annuals and gift-books, an\r\nemployment which the young man found particularly congenial. In his\r\n_Recollections_ Peter Parley draws a comparison between his two\r\ncontributors, Hawthorne and Willis, and records that everything Willis\r\nwrote attracted immediate attention, while the early productions of\r\nHawthorne passed almost unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Willis started on his own account with the _American Monthly\r\nMagazine_, which had an existence of little more than two years. He\r\nannounced that he could not afford to pay for contributions, as he\r\nexpected only a small circulation, and he wrote most of the copy\r\nhimself. Every month there were discursive, gossiping editorial\r\narticles in that 'personal' vein which has been worked with so much\r\nindustry in our own day. He took his readers into his confidence,\r\nprattled about his japonica and his pastilles, and described his\r\nfavourite bird, a scarlet trulian, and his dogs, Ugolino and L. E. L.,\r\nwho slept in the waste-paper basket. He professed to write with a\r\nbottle of Rudesheimer and a plate of olives at his elbow, and it was\r\nhinted that he ate fruit in summer with an amber-handled fork to keep\r\nhis palm cool!\r\n\r\nThese youthful affectations had a peculiarly exasperating effect upon\r\nmen of a different type; and Willis became the butt of the more\r\nold-fashioned critics, who vied with each other in inventing\r\nopprobrious epithets to shower upon the head of this young puppy of\r\njournalism. However, Nathaniel was not a person who could easily\r\nbe suppressed, and he soon became one of the most popular\r\nmagazine-writers of his time, his prose being described by an admirer\r\nas 'delicate and brief like a white jacket--transparent like a lump of\r\nsugar in champagne--soft-tempered like the sea-breeze at night.'\r\nUnfortunately, the magazines paid but little, even for prose of the\r\nabove description, and Willis presently found himself in financial\r\ndifficulties; while, with all his acknowledged fascinations, he was\r\nunlucky in his first love-affair. He became engaged to a beautiful\r\ngirl called Mary Benham, but her guardian broke off the match, and the\r\nlady, who seems to have had an inclination for literary men,\r\nafterwards married Motley, the historian of the Dutch Republic.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the _American Monthly Magazine_ ceased to appear, and\r\nWillis, leaving Boston and his creditors without regret, obtained the\r\npost of assistant-editor on the _New York Mirror_, a weekly paper\r\ndevoted to literature, light fiction, and the fine arts. It was the\r\nproperty of Morris, author of the once world-famous song, 'Woodman,\r\nspare that Tree,' and the editor-in-chief was Theodore Fay, a novelist\r\nof some distinction. Soon after his appointment it was decided that\r\nWillis should be sent to Europe as foreign correspondent of his paper.\r\nA sum of about a hundred pounds was scraped together for his expenses,\r\nand it was arranged that he should write weekly letters at the rate of\r\ntwo guineas a letter. In the autumn of 1831 he sailed in a\r\nmerchant-vessel for Havre, whence he journeyed to Paris in November.\r\nHere he spent the first five or six months of his tour, and here began\r\nthe series of 'Pencillings by the Way,' a portion of which gained him\r\nrather an unwelcome notoriety in English society by reason of the\r\n'personalities' it contained. When published in book form the\r\nPencillings were considerably toned down, and the proper names were\r\nrepresented by initials, so that people who read them then for the\r\nfirst time wondered what all the excitement had been about. As the\r\nchapters which relate to England are of most interest to English\r\nreaders, Willis's continental adventures need only be briefly noticed.\r\nThe extracts here quoted are taken from the original letters as they\r\nappeared in the _New York Mirror_, which differ in many respects\r\nfrom the version that was published in London after the attack by the\r\n_Quarterly Review_.\r\n\r\nIn Paris Willis found himself in his element, and was made much of by\r\nthe Anglo-French community, which was then under the special patronage\r\nof Lafayette. One of the most interesting of his new acquaintances was\r\nthe Countess Guiccioli, upon whose appearance and manners he comments\r\nwith characteristic frankness.\r\n\r\n'I met the Guiccioli yesterday in the Tuileries,' he writes shortly\r\nafter his arrival. 'She looks much younger than I anticipated, and is\r\na handsome blonde, apparently about thirty. I am told by a gentleman\r\nwho knows her that she has become a great flirt, and is quite spoiled\r\nby admiration. The celebrity of Lord Byron's attachment would\r\ncertainly make her a very desirable acquaintance were she much less\r\npretty than she really is, and I am told her drawing-room is thronged\r\nwith lovers of all nations contending for a preference which, having\r\nonce been given, should be buried, I think, for ever.' A little later\r\nhe has himself been introduced to the Guiccioli, and he describes an\r\ninterview which he has had with her, when the conversation turned upon\r\nher friendship with Shelley.\r\n\r\n'She gave me one of his letters to herself as an autograph,' he\r\nnarrates. 'She says he was at times a little crazy--_fou_, as she\r\nexpressed it--but there never was a nobler or a better man. Lord\r\nByron, she says, loved him as a brother.... There were several\r\nminiatures of Byron hanging up in the room; I asked her if any of them\r\nwere perfect in the resemblance. \"No,\" she said, \"that is the most\r\nlike him,\" taking down a miniature by an Italian artist, \"_mais il\r\nétait beaucoup plus beau--beaucoup--beaucoup_.\" She reiterated the\r\nword with a very touching tenderness, and continued to look at the\r\nportrait for some time.... She went on talking of the painters who had\r\ndrawn Byron, and said the American, West's, was the best likeness. I\r\ndid not tell her that West's portrait of herself was excessively\r\nflattered. I am sure no one would know her, from the engraving at\r\nleast. Her cheek-bones are high, her forehead is badly shaped, and\r\naltogether the frame of her features is decidedly ugly. She dresses in\r\nthe worst taste too, and yet for all this, and poetry and celebrity\r\naside, the countess is both a lovely and a fascinating woman, and one\r\nwhom a man of sentiment would admire at this age very sincerely, but\r\nnot for beauty.'\r\n\r\nThe cholera frightened Willis away from Paris in April, but before he\r\nleft, the United States minister, Mr. Rives, appointed him honorary\r\nattaché to his own embassy, a great social advantage to the young man,\r\nwho was thereby enabled to obtain the _entrée_ into court circles\r\nin every country that he visited. At the same time the appointment\r\nsomewhat misled his numerous new acquaintances on the subject of his\r\nsocial position, while the 'spurious' attachéship afterwards became a\r\nweapon in the hands of his enemies. However, for the time being, the\r\nyoung correspondent thoroughly enjoyed his novel experiences, and\r\ncontrived to communicate his enjoyment to his readers. His letters\r\nwere eagerly read by his countrymen, and are said to have been copied\r\ninto no less than five hundred newspapers. He eschewed useful\r\ninformation, gave impressions rather than statistics, and was fairly\r\nsuccessful in avoiding the style of the guide-book. The summer and\r\nautumn of 1832 were spent in northern Italy, Florence being the\r\ntraveller's headquarters. He had letters of introduction to half the\r\nItalian nobility, and was made welcome in the court circles of\r\nTuscany. In the autumn he was flirting at the Baths of Lucca, and at\r\nthis time he had formed a project of travelling to London by way of\r\nSwitzerland. 'In London,' he writes to his sister, 'I mean to make\r\narrangements with the magazines, and then live abroad altogether. It\r\ncosts so little here, and one lives so luxuriously too, and there is\r\nso much to fill one's mind and eye, that I think of returning to naked\r\nAmerica with ever-increasing repugnance. I love my country, but the\r\n_ornamental_ is my vocation, and of this she has none.' This\r\nprogramme was changed, and Willis spent the winter between Rome,\r\nFlorence, and Venice. Wherever he went he made friends, but his\r\nprogress was in itself a feat of diplomacy, and few people dreamt that\r\nthe dashing young attaché depended for his living upon his\r\ncontributions to a newspaper, payment for which did not always arrive\r\nwith desirable punctuality. 'I have dined,' he writes to his mother,\r\n'with a prince one day, and alone in a cook-shop the next.' He\r\nexplains that he can live on about sixty pounds a year at Florence,\r\npaying four or five shillings a week for his rooms, breakfasting for\r\nfourpence, and dining quite magnificently for a shilling.\r\n\r\nIn June 1833, Willis was invited by the officers of an American\r\nfrigate to accompany them on a six months' cruise in the\r\nMediterranean. This was far too good an offer to be refused, since it\r\nwould have been impossible to get a peep at the East under more ideal\r\nconditions of travel. Willis's letters from Greece and Turkey are\r\namong the best and happiest that he wrote, for the weather was\r\nperfect, the company was pleasant (there were ladies on board), and\r\nthe reception they met with wherever they weighed anchor was most\r\nhospitable; while the Oriental mode of life appealed to our hero's\r\nhighly-coloured, romantic taste. In the island of Ægina he was\r\nintroduced to Byron's Maid of Athens, once the beautiful Teresa Makri,\r\nnow plain Mrs. Black, with an ugly little boy, and a Scotch terrier\r\nthat snapped at the traveller's heels. He describes the\r\n_ci-devant_ Maid of Athens as a handsome woman, with a clear dark\r\nskin, and a nose and forehead that formed the straight line of the\r\nGreek model.\r\n\r\n'Her eyes are large,' he continues, 'and of a soft, liquid hazel, and\r\nthis is her chief beauty. There is that looking out of the soul\r\nthrough them which Byron always described as constituting the\r\nloveliness that most moved him.... We met her as simple Mrs. Black,\r\nwhose husband's terrier had worried us at the door, and we left her\r\nfeeling that the poetry she called forth from the heart of Byron was\r\nher due by every law of loveliness.'\r\n\r\nBy this time the fame of the _Pencillings_ had reached London;\r\nand at Smyrna Willis found a letter awaiting him from the _Morning\r\nHerald_, which contained an offer of the post of foreign\r\ncorrespondent at a salary of £200 a year. But as his letters would\r\nhave to be mainly political, and as he might be expected to act as\r\nwar-correspondent, which was scarcely in his line, he decided to\r\nrefuse the offer. On leaving the frigate he loitered through Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, and France to England, arriving at Dover on June 1, 1834.\r\nWhile at Florence he had made the acquaintance of Walter Savage\r\nLandor, who had given him some valuable letters of introduction to\r\npeople in England, among them one to Lady Blessington. Landor also put\r\ninto Willis's hands a package of books, whose temporary disappearance\r\nthrough some mismanagement roused the formidable wrath of the old\r\npoet. In his _Letter to an Author_, printed at the end of\r\n_Pericles and Aspasia_, Landor describes the transaction (which\r\nrelated to an American edition of the _Imaginary Conversations_),\r\nand continues:--\r\n\r\n'I regret the appearance of his book (the _Pencillings by the\r\nWay_) more than the disappearance of mine.... My letter of\r\npresentation to Lady Blessington threw open (I am afraid) too many\r\nfolding-doors, some of which have been left rather uncomfortably ajar.\r\nNo doubt his celebrity as a poet, and his dignity as a diplomatist,\r\nwould have procured him all those distinctions in society which he\r\nallowed so humble a person as myself the instrumentality of\r\nconferring. Greatly as I have been flattered by the visits of American\r\ngentlemen, I hope that for the future no penciller of similar\r\ncomposition will deviate in my favour to the right hand of the road\r\nfrom Florence to Fiesole.'\r\n\r\nThe end of this storm in a teacup was that the books, which had safely\r\narrived in New York, returned as safely to London, where they were\r\nhanded over to their rightful owner, but not in time, as Willis\r\ncomplained, to keep him from going down to posterity astride the finis\r\nto _Pericles and Aspasia_. Long afterwards he expressed his hope\r\nthat Landor's biographers would either let him slip off at Lethe's\r\nwharf, or else do him justice in a note. Before this unfortunate\r\nincident, Landor and Willis had corresponded on cordial terms. The old\r\npoet wrote to say how much he envied his correspondent the evenings he\r\npassed in the society of 'the most accomplished and graceful of all\r\nour fashionable world, my excellent friend, Lady Blessington,' while\r\nthe American could not sufficiently express his gratitude for the\r\nintroduction to that lady, 'my lodestar and most valued friend,' as he\r\ncalled her, 'for whose acquaintance I am so much indebted to you, that\r\nyou will find it difficult in your lifetime to diminish my\r\nobligations.'\r\n\r\nWillis seems to have arrived in England prepared to like everything\r\nEnglish, and he began by falling in love with the Ship Hotel at Dover,\r\n'with its bells that _would_ ring, doors that _would_ shut,\r\nblazing coal fires [on June 1], and its landlady who spoke English,\r\nand was civil--a greater contrast to the Continent could hardly he\r\nimagined.' The next morning he was in raptures over the coach that\r\ntook him to London, with its light harness, four beautiful bays, and\r\ndashing coachman, who discussed the Opera, and hummed airs from the\r\n_Puritani_. He saw a hundred charming spots on the road that he\r\ncoveted with quite a heartache, and even the little houses and gardens\r\nin the suburbs pleased his taste--there was such an _affectionateness_\r\nin the outside of every one of them. Regent Street he declares to be\r\nthe finest street he has ever seen, and he exclaims, 'The Toledo of\r\nNaples, the Corso of Rome, the Rue de la Paix, and the Boulevards\r\nof Paris are really nothing to Regent Street.'\r\n\r\nWillis called on Lady Blessington in the afternoon of the day after\r\nhis arrival, but was informed that her ladyship was not yet down to\r\nbreakfast. An hour later, however, he received a note from her\r\ninviting him to call the same evening at ten o'clock. She was then\r\nliving at Seamore House, while D'Orsay had lodgings in Curzon Street.\r\nWillis tells us that he found a very beautiful woman exquisitely\r\ndressed, who looked on the sunny side of thirty, though she frankly\r\nowned to forty, and was, in fact, forty-five. Lady Blessington\r\nreceived the young American very cordially, introduced him to the\r\nmagnificent D'Orsay, and plunged at once into literary talk. She was\r\ncurious to know the degree of popularity enjoyed by English authors in\r\nAmerica, more especially by Bulwer and D'Israeli, both of whom she\r\npromised that he should meet at her house.\r\n\r\n'D'Israeli the elder,' she said, 'came here with his son the other\r\nnight. It would have delighted you to see the old man's pride in him.\r\nAs he was going away, he patted him on the head, and said, \"Take care\r\nof him, Lady Blessington, for my sake. He is a clever lad, but wants\r\nballast. I am glad he has the honour to know you, for you will check\r\nhim sometimes when I am away....\" D'Israeli the younger is quite his\r\nown character of Vivian Grey, crowded with talent, but very\r\n_soigné_ of his curls, and a bit of a coxcomb. There is no\r\nreverse about him, however, and he is the only _joyous_ dandy I\r\never saw.' Then the conversation turned upon Byron, and Willis asked\r\nif Lady Blessington had known La Guiccioli. 'No; we were at Pisa when\r\nthey were together,' she replied. 'But though Lord Blessington had the\r\ngreatest curiosity to see her, Lord Byron would never permit it. \"She\r\nhas a red head of her own,\" said he, \"and don't like to show it.\"\r\nByron treated the poor creature dreadfully ill. She feared more than\r\nshe loved him.'\r\n\r\nOn concluding this account of his visit, Willis observes that there\r\ncan be no objection to his publishing such personal descriptions and\r\nanecdotes in an American periodical, since 'the English just know of\r\nour existence, and if they get an idea twice a year of our progress in\r\npolitics, they are comparatively well informed. Our periodical\r\nliterature is never even heard of. I mention this fact lest, at first\r\nthought, I might seem to have abused the hospitality or the frankness\r\nof those on whom letters of introduction have given me claims for\r\ncivility.' Alas, poor Willis! He little thought that one of the most\r\ndistinguished and most venomous of British critics would make a long\r\narm across the Atlantic, and hold up his prattlings to ridicule and\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nThe following evening our Penciller met a distinguished company at\r\nSeamore House, the two Bulwers, Edward and Henry; James Smith of\r\n'Rejected Addresses' fame; Fonblanque, the editor of the\r\n_Examiner_; and the young Duc de Richelieu. Of Fonblanque, Willis\r\nobserves: 'I never saw a worse face, sallow, seamed, and hollow, his\r\nteeth irregular, his skin livid, his straight black hair uncombed. A\r\nhollow, croaking voice, and a small, fiery black eye, with a smile\r\nlike a skeleton's, certainly did not improve his physiognomy.'\r\nFonblanque, as might have been anticipated, did not at all appreciate\r\nthis description of his personal defects, when it afterwards appeared\r\nin print. Edward Bulwer was quite unlike what Willis had expected. 'He\r\nis short,' he writes, 'very much bent, slightly knock-kneed, and as\r\nill-dressed a man for a gentleman as you will find in London.... He\r\nhas a retreating forehead, large aquiline nose, immense red whiskers,\r\nand a mouth contradictory of all talent. A more good-natured,\r\nhabitually smiling, nerveless expression could hardly be imagined.'\r\nBulwer seems to have made up for his appearance by his high spirits,\r\nlover-like voice, and delightful conversation, some of which our\r\nBoswell has reported.\r\n\r\n'Smith asked Bulwer if he kept an amanuensis. \"No,\" he said, \"I\r\nscribble it all out myself, and send it to the press in a most\r\nungentlemanlike hand, half print, half hieroglyphics, with all its\r\nimperfections on its head, and correct in the proof--very much to the\r\ndissatisfaction of the publisher, who sends me in a bill of £16, 6s.\r\n4d. for extra corrections. Then I am free to confess I don't know\r\ngrammar. Lady Blessington, do you know grammar? There never was such a\r\nthing heard of before Lindley Murray. I wonder what they did for\r\ngrammar before his day! Oh, the delicious blunders one sees when they\r\nare irretrievable! And the best of it is the critics never get hold of\r\nthem. Thank Heaven for second editions, that one may scratch out one's\r\nblots, and go down clean and gentlemanlike to posterity.\" Smith asked\r\nhim if he had ever reviewed one of his own books. \"No, but I could!\r\nAnd then how I should like to recriminate, and defend myself\r\nindignantly! I think I could be preciously severe. Depend upon it,\r\nnobody knows a book's faults so well as its author. I have a great\r\nidea of criticising my books for my posthumous memoirs. Shall I,\r\nSmith? Shall I, Lady Blessington?\"'\r\n\r\nWillis fell into conversation with the good-natured, though gouty\r\nJames Smith, who talked to him of America, and declared that there\r\nnever was so delightful a fellow as Washington Irving. 'I was once,'\r\nhe said, 'taken down with him into the country by a merchant to\r\ndinner. Our friend stopped his carriage at the gate of his park, and\r\nasked if we would walk through the grounds to the house. Irving\r\nrefused, and held me down by the coat-tails, so that we drove on to\r\nthe house together, leaving our host to follow on foot. \"I make it a\r\nprinciple,\" said Irving, \"never to walk with a man through his own\r\ngrounds. I have no idea of praising a thing whether I like it or not.\r\nYou and I will do them to-morrow by ourselves.\"' 'The Rejected\r\nAddresses,' continues Willis, 'got on his crutches about three o'clock\r\nin the morning, and I made my exit with the rest, thanking Heaven\r\nthat, though in a strange country, my mother-tongue was the language\r\nof its men of genius.'\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting passages in the _Pencillings_ is that\r\nin which Willis describes a breakfast at Crabb Robinson's chambers in\r\nthe Temple, where he met Charles and Mary Lamb, a privilege which he\r\nseems thoroughly to have appreciated. 'I never in my life,' he\r\ndeclares, 'had an invitation more to my taste. The _Essays of\r\nElia_ are certainly the most charming things in the world, and it\r\nhas been, for the last ten years, my highest compliment to the\r\nliterary taste of a friend to present him with a copy.... I arrived\r\nhalf an hour before Lamb, and had time to learn something of his\r\npeculiarities. Some family circumstances have tended to depress him of\r\nlate years, and unless excited by convivial intercourse, he never\r\nshows a trace of what he once was. He is excessively given to\r\nmystifying his friends, and is never so delighted as when he has\r\npersuaded some one into a belief in one of his grave inventions....\r\nThere was a rap at the door at last, and enter a gentleman in black\r\nsmall clothes and gaiters, short and very slight in his person, his\r\nhair just sprinkled with grey, a beautiful, deep-set, grey eye,\r\naquiline nose, and a very indescribable mouth. His sister, whose\r\nliterary reputation is very closely associated with her brother's,\r\ncame in after him. She is a small, bent figure, evidently a victim to\r\nill-health, and hears with difficulty. Her face has been, I should\r\nthink, a fine, handsome one, and her bright grey eye is still full of\r\nintelligence and fire....\r\n\r\n'I had set a large arm-chair for Miss Lamb. \"Don't take it, Mary,\"\r\nsaid Lamb, pulling it away from her very gravely. \"It looks as if you\r\nwere going to have a tooth drawn.\" The conversation was very local,\r\nbut perhaps in this way I saw more of the author, for his manner of\r\nspeaking of their mutual friends, and the quaint humour with which he\r\ncomplained of one, and spoke well of another, was so completely in the\r\nvein of his inimitable writings, that I could have fancied myself\r\nlistening to an audible composition of new Elia. Nothing could be more\r\ndelightful than the kindness and affection between the brother and\r\nsister, though Lamb was continually taking advantage of her deafness\r\nto mystify her on every topic that was started. \"Poor Mary,\" he said,\r\n\"she hears all of an epigram but the point.\" \"What are you saying of\r\nme, Charles?\" she asked. \"Mr. Willis,\" said he, raising his voice,\r\n\"admires your _Confessions of a Drunkard_ very much, and I was\r\nsaying that it was no merit of yours that you understood the subject.\"\r\n\r\n'The conversation presently turned upon literary topics, and Lamb\r\nobserved: \"I don't know much of your American authors. Mary, there,\r\ndevours Cooper's novels with a ravenous appetite with which I have no\r\nsympathy. The only American book I ever read twice was the _Journal\r\nof Edward Woolman_, a Quaker preacher and tinker, whose character\r\nis one of the finest I ever met. He tells a story or two about negro\r\nslaves that brought the tears into my eyes. I can read no prose now,\r\nthough Hazlitt sometimes, to be sure--but then Hazlitt is worth all\r\nthe modern prose-writers put together.\" I mentioned having bought a\r\ncopy of _Elia_ the last day I was in America, to send as a\r\nparting gift to one of the most lovely and talented women in the\r\ncountry. \"What did you give for it?\" asked Lamb. \"About\r\nseven-and-six.\" \"Permit me to pay you that,\" said he, and with the\r\nutmost earnestness he counted the money out on the table. \"I never yet\r\nwrote anything that would sell,\" he continued. \"I am the publisher's\r\nruin. My last poem won't sell a copy. Have you seen it, Mr. Willis?\" I\r\nhad not. \"It is only eighteenpence, and I'll give you sixpence towards\r\nit,\" and he described to me where I should find it sticking up in a\r\nshop-window in the Strand.\r\n\r\n'Lamb ate nothing, and complained in a querulous tone of the veal pie.\r\nThere was a kind of potted fish, which he had expected that our friend\r\nwould procure for him. He inquired whether there was not a morsel left\r\nin the bottom of the last pot. Mr. Robinson was not sure. \"Send and\r\nsee,\" said Lamb, \"and if the pot has been cleaned, bring me the lid. I\r\nthink the sight of it would do me good.\" The cover was brought, upon\r\nwhich there was a picture of the fish. Lamb kissed it with a\r\nreproachful look at his friend, and then left the table and began to\r\nwander round the room with a broken, uncertain step, as if he almost\r\nforgot to put one leg before the other. His sister rose after a while,\r\nand commenced walking up and down in the same manner on the opposite\r\nside of the table, and in the course of half an hour they took their\r\nleave.' Landor, in commenting on this passage, says it is evident that\r\nWillis 'fidgeted the Lambs,' and seems rather unaccountably annoyed at\r\nhis having alluded to Crabb Robinson simply as 'a barrister.'\r\n\r\nIn London Willis appears to have fallen upon his feet from the very\r\nfirst. To the end of his life he looked back upon his first two years\r\nin England as the happiest and most successful period in his whole\r\ncareer. It was small wonder that he became a little dazzled and\r\nintoxicated by the brilliancy of his surroundings, which spoilt him\r\nfor the homelier conditions of American life. 'What a star is mine,'\r\nhe wrote to his sister Julia, three days after landing at Dover. 'All\r\nthe best society of London exclusives is now open to me--_me!_\r\nwithout a sou in my pocket beyond what my pen brings me, and with not\r\nonly no influence from friends at home, but with a world of envy and\r\nslander at my back.... In a literary way I have already had offers\r\nfrom the _Court Magazine_, the _Metropolitan_, and the _New\r\nMonthly_, of the first price for my articles. I sent a short\r\ntale, written in one day, to the _Court Magazine_, and they gave\r\nme eight guineas for it at once. I lodge in Cavendish Square, the most\r\nfashionable part of the town, paying a guinea a week for my lodgings,\r\nand am as well off as if I had been the son of the President.'\r\n\r\nWillis was constantly at Lady Blessington's house, where he met some\r\nof the best masculine society of the day. At one dinner-party among\r\nhis fellow-guests were D'Israeli, Bulwer, Procter (Barry Cornwall),\r\nLord Durham, and Sir Martin Shee. It was his first sight of Dizzy,\r\nwhom he found looking out of the window with the last rays of sunlight\r\nreflected on the gorgeous gold flowers of an embroidered waistcoat. A\r\nwhite stick with a black cord and tassel, and a quantity of chains\r\nabout his neck and pocket, rendered him rather a conspicuous object.\r\n'D'Israeli,' says our chronicler, 'has one of the most remarkable\r\nfaces I ever saw. He is vividly pale, and but for the energy of his\r\naction and the strength of his lungs, would seem a victim to\r\nconsumption. His eye is as black as Erebus, and has the most mocking,\r\nlying-in-wait expression conceivable. His mouth is alive with a kind\r\nof impatient nervousness, and when he has burst forth with a\r\nparticularly successful cataract of expression, it assumes a curl of\r\ntriumphant scorn that would be worthy of Mephistopheles. A thick,\r\nheavy mass of jet-black ringlets falls over his left cheek almost to\r\nhis collarless stock, while on the right temple it is parted and put\r\naway with the smooth carefulness of a girl's, and shines most\r\nunctuously with \"thy incomparable oil, Macassar.\"' Willis was always\r\ninterested in dress, being himself a born dandy, and he was inclined\r\nto judge a man by the cut of his coat and the set of his hat. On this\r\noccasion he remarks that Bulwer was very badly dressed as usual, while\r\nCount D'Orsay was very splendid, but quite indefinable. 'He seemed\r\nshowily dressed till you looked to particulars, and then it seemed\r\nonly a simple thing well fitted to a very magnificent person.'\r\n\r\nThe conversation ran at first on Sir Henry Taylor's new play,\r\n_Philip van Artevelde_, which the company thought overrated, and\r\nthen passed to Beckford, of _Vathek_ fame, who had already\r\nretired from the world, and was living at Bath in his usual eccentric\r\nfashion. Dizzy was the only person present who had met him, and,\r\ndeclares Willis, 'I might as well attempt to gather up the foam of the\r\nsea as to convey an idea of the extraordinary language in which he\r\nclothed his description. There were at least five words in every\r\nsentence which must have been very much astonished at the use to which\r\nthey were put, and yet no others apparently could so well have\r\nconveyed his idea. He talked like a racehorse approaching the\r\nwinning-post, every muscle in action, and the utmost energy of\r\nexpression flowing out in every burst. It is a great pity he is not in\r\nParliament.'\r\n\r\nAt midnight Lady Blessington left the table, when the conversation\r\ntook a political turn, but D'Israeli soon dashed off again with a\r\nstory of an Irish dragoon who was killed in the Peninsular. 'His arm\r\nwas shot off, and he was bleeding to death. When told he could not\r\nlive, he called for a large silver goblet, out of which he usually\r\ndrank his claret. He held it to the gushing artery, and filled it to\r\nthe brim, then poured it slowly out upon the ground, saying, \"If that\r\nhad been shed for old Ireland.\" You can have no idea how thrillingly\r\nthis little story was told. Fonblanque, however, who is a cold\r\npolitical satirist, could see nothing in a man's \"decanting his\r\nclaret\" that was in the least sublime, so \"Vivian Grey\" got into a\r\npassion, and for a while was silent.'\r\n\r\nWillis was now fairly launched in London society, literary and\r\nfashionable. He went to the Opera to hear Grisi, then young and\r\npretty, and Lady Blessington pointed out the beautiful Mrs. Norton,\r\nlooking like a queen, and Lord Brougham flirting desperately with a\r\nlovely woman, 'his mouth going with the convulsive twitch that so\r\ndisfigures him, and his most unsightly of pug-noses in the strongest\r\nrelief against the red lining of the box.' He breakfasted with 'Barry\r\nCornwall,' whose poetry he greatly admired, and was introduced to the\r\ncharming Mrs. Procter and the 'yellow-tressed Adelaide,' then only\r\neight or nine years old. Procter gave his visitor a volume of his own\r\npoems, and told him anecdotes of the various authors he had known,\r\nHazlitt, Lamb, Keats, and Shelley. Another interesting entertainment\r\nwas an evening party at Edward Bulwer's house. Willis arrived at\r\neleven, and found his hostess alone, playing with a King Charles'\r\nspaniel, while she awaited her guests.\r\n\r\n'The author of _Pelham_,' he writes, 'is a younger son, and\r\ndepends on his writings for a livelihood; and truly, measuring works\r\nof fancy by what they will bring, a glance round his luxurious rooms\r\nis worth reams of puffs in the Quarterlies. He lives in the heart of\r\nfashionable London, entertains a great deal, and is expensive in all\r\nhis habits, and for this pay Messrs. Clifford, Pelham, and Aram--most\r\nexcellent bankers. As I looked at the beautiful woman before me,\r\nwaiting to receive the rank and fashion of London, I thought that\r\nclose-fisted old literature never had better reason for his partial\r\nlargess.'\r\n\r\nWillis was astonished at the neglect with which the female portion of\r\nthe assemblage was treated, no young man ever speaking to a young lady\r\nexcept to ask her to dance. 'There they sit with their mammas,' he\r\nobserves, 'their hands before them in the received attitude; and if\r\nthere happens to be no dancing, looking at a print, or eating an ice,\r\nis for them the most entertaining circumstance of the evening. Late in\r\nthe evening a charming girl, who is the reigning belle of Naples, came\r\nin with her mother from the Opera, and I made this same remark to her.\r\n\"I detest England for that very reason,\" she said frankly. \"It is the\r\nfashion in London for young men to prefer everything to the society of\r\nwomen. They have their clubs, their horses, their rowing matches,\r\ntheir hunting, and everything else is a _bore_! How different are\r\nthe same men at Naples! They can never get enough of one there.\"...\r\nShe mentioned several of the beaux of last winter who had returned to\r\nEngland. \"Here have I been in London a month, and these very men who\r\nwere at my side all day on the Strada Nuova, and all but fighting to\r\ndance three times with me of an evening, have only left their cards.\r\nNot because they care less about me, but because it is not the\r\nfashion--it would be talked about at the clubs; it is _knowing_\r\nto let us alone.\"'\r\n\r\nThere were only three men at the party, according to Willis, who could\r\ncome under the head of _beaux_, but there were many distinguished\r\npersons. There was Byron's sister, Mrs. Leigh, a thin, plain,\r\nmiddle-aged woman, of a serious countenance, but with very cordial,\r\npleasing manners. Sheil, the famous Irish orator, small, dark,\r\ndeceitful, and talented-looking, with a squeaky voice, was to be seen\r\nin earnest conversation with the courtly old Lord Clarendon.\r\nFonblanque, with his pale, dislocated-looking face, was making the\r\namiable, with a ghastly smile, to Lady Stepney, author of _The Road\r\nto Ruin_ and other fashionable novels. The bilious Lord Durham,\r\nwith his Brutus head and severe countenance, high-bred in appearance\r\nin spite of the worst possible coat and trousers, was talking politics\r\nwith Bowring. Prince Moscowa, son of Marshal Ney, a plain,\r\ndetermined-looking young man, was unconscious of everything but the\r\npresence of the lovely Mrs. Leicester Stanhope. Her husband,\r\nafterwards Sir Leicester, who had been Byron's companion in Greece,\r\nwas introduced to Willis, and the two soon became on intimate terms.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the season Willis made the acquaintance of Miss\r\nMitford, who invited him to spend a week with her at her cottage near\r\nReading. In a letter to her friend, Miss Jephson, Miss Mitford says:\r\n'I also like very much Mr. Willis, an American author, who is now\r\nunderstood to be here to publish his account of England. He is a very\r\nelegant young man, more like one of the best of our peers' sons than a\r\nrough republican.' The admiration was apparently mutual, for Willis,\r\nin a letter to the author of _Our Village_, says: 'You are\r\ndistinguished in the world as the \"gentlewoman\" among authoresses, as\r\nyou are for your rank merely in literature. I have often thought you\r\nvery enviable for the universality of that opinion about you. You\r\nshare it with Sir Philip Sidney, who was in his day the\r\n_gentleman_ among authors. I look with great interest for your\r\nnew tragedy. I think your mind is essentially dramatic; and in that,\r\nin our time, you are alone. I know no one else who could have written\r\n_Rienzi_, and I felt _Charles I._ to my fingers' ends, as one\r\nfeels no other modern play.'\r\n\r\nWillis was less happy in his relations with Harriet Martineau, to whom\r\nhe was introduced just before her departure for America. 'While I was\r\npreparing for my travels,' she writes, in her own account of the\r\ninterview, 'an acquaintance brought a buxom gentleman, whom he\r\nintroduced under the name of Willis. There was something rather\r\nengaging in the round face, brisk air, and _enjouement_ of\r\nthe young man; but his conscious dandyism and unparalleled\r\nself-complacency spoiled the satisfaction, though they increased the\r\ninclination to laugh.... He whipped his bright little boot with his\r\nbright little cane, while he ran over the names of all his\r\ndistinguished fellow-countrymen, and declared that he would send me\r\nletters to them all.' Miss Martineau further relates that the few\r\nletters she presented met with a very indifferent reception. Her\r\nindignation increased when she found that in his private\r\ncorrespondence Willis had given the impression that she was one of his\r\nmost intimate friends. In his own account of the interview he merely\r\nsays: 'I was taken by the clever translator of Faust to see the\r\ncelebrated Miss Martineau. She has perhaps at this moment the most\r\ngeneral and enviable reputation in England, and is the only one of the\r\nliterary clique whose name is mentioned without some envious\r\nqualification.'\r\n\r\nA budget of literary news sent to the _Mirror_ includes such\r\nitems as that 'D'Israeli is driving about in an open carriage with\r\nLady S., looking more melancholy than usual. The absent baronet, whose\r\nplace he fills, is about to bring an action against him, which will\r\nfinish his career, unless he can coin the damages in his brain. Mrs.\r\nHemans is dying of consumption in Ireland. I have been passing a week\r\nat a country-house, where Miss Jane Porter [author of _Scottish\r\nChiefs_] and Miss Pardoe [author of _Beauties of the Bosphorus_]\r\nwere staying. Miss Porter is one of her own heroines grown old,\r\na still noble wreck of beauty.... Dined last week with Joanna\r\nBaillie at Hampstead--the most charming old lady I ever saw.\r\nTo-day I dine with Longman, to meet Tom Moore, who is living\r\n_incog._ near this Nestor of publishers, and pegging hard at his\r\n_History of Ireland_.... Lady Blessington's new book makes a\r\ngreat noise. Living as she does twelve hours out of the twenty-four in\r\nthe midst of the most brilliant and intellectually exhausting circle\r\nin London, I only wonder how she found time to write it. Yet it was\r\nwritten in six weeks! Her novels sell for a hundred pounds more than\r\nany other author's, except Bulwer's. Bulwer gets £1400; Lady\r\nBlessington, £400; Mrs. Norton, £250; Lady Charlotte Bury, £200;\r\nGrattan, £300; and most other authors below this. Captain Marryat's\r\ngross trash sells immensely about Wapping and Portsmouth, and brings\r\nhim in £500 or £600 the book--but that can scarce be called\r\nliterature. D'Israeli cannot sell a book _at all_, I hear. Is not\r\nthat odd? I would give more for one of his books than for forty of the\r\ncommon saleable things about town.'\r\n\r\nOne more description of a literary dinner at Lady Blessington's may be\r\nquoted before Willis's account of this, his first and most memorable\r\nLondon season, is brought to an end. Among the company on this\r\noccasion were Moore, D'Israeli, and Dr. Beattie, the King's physician,\r\nwho was himself a poet. Moore had been ruralising for a year at\r\nSlopperton Cottage, and, before his arrival, D'Israeli expressed his\r\nregret that he should have been met on his return to town with a\r\nsavage article in _Fraser_ on his supposed plagiarisms. Lady\r\nBlessington declared that he would never see it, since he guarded\r\nhimself against the sight and knowledge of criticism as other people\r\nguarded against the plague. Some one remarked on Moore's passion for\r\nrank. 'He was sure to have five or six invitations to dine on the same\r\nday,' it was said, 'and he tormented himself with the idea that he had\r\nperhaps not accepted the most exclusive. He would get off from an\r\nengagement with a countess to dine with a marchioness, and from a\r\nmarchioness to accept the invitation of a duchess. As he cared little\r\nfor the society of men, and would sing and be delightful only for the\r\napplause of women, it mattered little whether one circle was more\r\ntalented than another.' At length Mr. Moore was announced, and the\r\npoet, 'sliding his little feet up to Lady Blessington, made his\r\ncompliments with an ease and gaiety, combined with a kind of\r\nworshipping deference, that were worthy of a prime minister at the\r\nCourt of Love.... His eyes still sparkle like a champagne bubble,\r\nthough the invader has drawn his pencillings about the corners; and\r\nthere is a kind of wintry red that seems enamelled on his cheek, the\r\neloquent record of the claret his wit has brightened. His mouth is the\r\nmost characteristic feature of all. The lips are delicately cut, and\r\nas changeable as an aspen; but there is a set-up look about the lower\r\nlip--a determination of the muscle to a particular expression, and you\r\nfancy that you can see wit astride upon it. It is arch, confident, and\r\nhalf diffident, as if he were disguising his pleasure at applause,\r\nwhile another bright gleam of fancy was breaking upon him. The\r\nslightly tossed nose confirms the fun of his expression, and\r\naltogether it is a face that sparkles, beams, and radiates.'\r\n\r\nThe conversation at dinner that night was the most brilliant that the\r\nAmerican had yet heard in London. Sir Walter Scott was the first\r\nsubject of discussion, Lady Blessington having just received from Sir\r\nWilliam Gell the manuscript of a volume on the last days of Sir Walter\r\nScott, a melancholy chronicle of ruined health and weakened intellect,\r\nwhich was afterwards suppressed. Moore then described a visit he had\r\npaid to Abbotsford, when his host was in his prime. 'Scott,' he said,\r\n'was the most manly and natural character in the world. His\r\nhospitality was free and open as the day; he lived freely himself, and\r\nexpected his guests to do the same.... He never ate or drank to\r\nexcess, but he had no system; his constitution was Herculean, and he\r\ndenied himself nothing. I went once from a dinner-party at Sir Thomas\r\nLawrence's to meet Scott at another house. We had hardly entered the\r\nroom when we were set down to a hot supper of roast chicken, salmon,\r\npunch, etc., and Sir Walter ate immensely of everything. What a\r\ncontrast between this and the last time I saw him in London! He had\r\ncome to embark for Italy, quite broken down both in mind and body. He\r\ngave Mrs. Moore a book, and I asked him if he would make it more\r\nvaluable by writing in it. He thought I meant that he should write\r\nsome verses, and said, \"I never write poetry now.\" I asked him to\r\nwrite only his name and hers, and he attempted it, but it was quite\r\nillegible.'\r\n\r\nO'Connell next became the topic of conversation, and Moore declared\r\nthat he would be irresistible if it were not for two blots on his\r\ncharacter, viz. the contributions in Ireland for his support, and his\r\nrefusal to give satisfaction to the man he was willing to attack.\r\n'They may say what they will of duelling,' he continued, 'but it is\r\nthe great preserver of the decencies of society. The old school which\r\nmade a man responsible for his words was the better.' Moore related\r\nhow O'Connell had accepted Peel's challenge, and then delayed a\r\nmeeting on the ground of his wife's illness, till the law interfered.\r\nAnother Irish patriot refused a meeting on account of the illness of\r\nhis daughter, whereupon a Dublin wit composed the following epigram\r\nupon the two:--\r\n\r\n   'Some men with a horror of slaughter,\r\n      Improve on the Scripture command.\r\n   And honour their--wife and their daughter--\r\n      That their days may be long in the land.'\r\n\r\nAlluding to Grattan's dying advice to his son, 'Always be ready with\r\nthe pistol,' Moore asked, 'Is it not wonderful that, with all the\r\nagitation in Ireland, we have had no such men since his time? The\r\nwhole country in convulsion--people's lives, fortune, religion at\r\nstake, and not a gleam of talent from one's year's end to another. It\r\nis natural for sparks to be struck out in a time of violence like\r\nthis--but Ireland, for all that is worth living for, _is dead_!\r\nYou can scarcely reckon Sheil of the calibre of the spirits of old,\r\nand O'Connell, with all his faults, stands alone in his glory.'\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room, after dinner, some allusion to the later\r\nPlatonists caused D'Israeli to flare up. His wild black eyes\r\nglistened, and his nervous lips poured out eloquence, while a whole\r\nottomanful of noble exquisites listened in amazement. He gave an\r\naccount of Thomas Taylor, one of the last of the Platonists, who had\r\nworshipped Jupiter in a back-parlour in London a few years before. In\r\nhis old age he was turned out of his lodgings, for attempting, as he\r\nsaid, to worship his gods according to the dictates of his conscience,\r\nhis landlady having objected to his sacrificing a bull to Jupiter in\r\nher parlour. The company laughed at this story as a good invention,\r\nbut Dizzy assured them it was literally true, and gave his father as\r\nhis authority. Meanwhile Moore 'went glittering on' with criticisms\r\nupon Grisi and the Opera, and the subject of music being thus\r\nintroduced, he was led, with great difficulty, to the piano. Willis\r\ndescribes his singing as 'a kind of admirable recitative, in which\r\nevery shade of thought is syllabled and dwelt upon, and the sentiment\r\nof the song goes through your blood, warming you to the very eyelids,\r\nand starting your tears if you have a soul or sense in you. I have\r\nheard of women fainting at a song of Moore's; and if the burden of it\r\nanswered by chance to a secret in the bosom of the listener, I should\r\nthink that the heart would break with it. After two or three songs of\r\nLady Blessington's choice, he rambled over the keys a while, and then\r\nsang 'When first I met thee' with a pathos that beggars description.\r\nWhen the last word had faltered out, he rose and took Lady\r\nBlessington's hand, said Good-night, and was gone before a word was\r\nuttered. For a full minute after he closed the door no one spoke. I\r\ncould have wished for myself to drop silently asleep where I sat, with\r\nthe tears in my eyes and the softness upon my heart.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving received invitations to stay with Lord Dalhousie and the Duke\r\nof Gordon, Willis went north at the beginning of September, 1834. The\r\nnominal attraction of Scotland he found, rather to his dismay, was the\r\nshooting. The guest, he observes, on arriving at a country-house, is\r\nasked whether he prefers a flint or a percussion lock, and a\r\ndouble-barrelled Manton is put into his hands; while after breakfast\r\nthe ladies leave the table, wishing him good sport. 'I would rather\r\nhave gone to the library,' says the Penciller. 'An aversion to\r\nwalking, except upon smooth flag-stones, a poetical tenderness on the\r\nsubject of putting birds \"out of their misery,\" and hands much more at\r\nhome with the goose-quill than the gun, were some of my private\r\nobjections to the order of the day.' At Dalhousie, the son of the\r\nhouse, Lord Ramsay, and his American visitor were mutually astonished\r\nat each other's appearance when they met in the park, prepared for a\r\nmorning's sport.\r\n\r\n'From the elegant Oxonian I had seen at breakfast,' writes Willis, 'he\r\n(Lord Ramsay) was transformed into a figure something rougher than his\r\nHighland dependant, in a woollen shooting-jacket, pockets of any\r\nnumber and capacity, trousers of the coarsest plaid, hobnailed shoes\r\nand leather gaiters, and a habit of handling his gun that would have\r\nbeen respected on the Mississippi. My own appearance in high-heeled\r\nFrench boots and other corresponding gear, for a tramp over stubble\r\nand marsh, amused him equally; but my wardrobe was exclusively\r\nmetropolitan, and there was no alternative.' It was hard and exciting\r\nwork, the novice discovered, to trudge through peas, beans, turnips,\r\nand corn, soaked with showers, and muddied to the knees till his\r\nParisian boots were reduced to the consistency of brown paper. He came\r\nhome, much to his own relief, without having brought the blood of his\r\nhost's son and heir on his head, and he made a mental note never to go\r\nto Scotland again without hobnailed boots and a shooting-jacket.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Dalhousie Willis spent a few days in Edinburgh, where he\r\nbreakfasted with Professor Wilson, _alias_ Christopher North. The\r\nProfessor, he says, talked away famously, quite oblivious of the fact\r\nthat the tea was made, and the breakfast-dishes were smoking on the\r\ntable. He spoke much of Blackwood, who then lay dying, and described\r\nhim as a man of the most refined literary taste, whose opinion of a\r\nbook he would trust before that of any one he knew. Wilson inquired if\r\nhis guest had made the acquaintance of Lockhart. 'I have not,' replied\r\nWillis. 'He is almost the only literary man in London I have not met;\r\nand I must say, as the editor of the _Quarterly Review_, and the\r\nmost unfair and unprincipled critic of the day, I have no wish to know\r\nhim. I never heard him well spoken of. I have probably met a hundred\r\nof his acquaintances, but I have not yet seen one who pretended to be\r\nhis friend.' Wilson defended the absent one, who, he said, was the\r\nmildest and most unassuming of men, and dissected a book for pleasure,\r\nwithout thinking of the feelings of the author.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast had been cooling for an hour when the Professor leant\r\nback, with his chair still towards the fire, and 'seizing the teapot\r\nas if it were a sledge-hammer, he poured from one cup to the other\r\nwithout interrupting the stream, overrunning both cup and saucer, and\r\npartly flooding the tea-tray. He then set the cream towards me with a\r\ncarelessness that nearly overset it, and in trying to reach an egg\r\nfrom the centre of the table, broke two. He took no notice of his own\r\nawkwardness, but drank his cup of tea at a single draught, ate his egg\r\nin the same expeditious manner, and went on talking of the \"Noctes,\"\r\nand Lockhart, and Blackwood, as if eating his breakfast were rather a\r\ntroublesome parenthesis in his conversation.' Wilson offered to give\r\nhis guest letters to Wordsworth and Southey, if he intended to return\r\nby the Lakes. 'I lived a long time in their neighbourhood,' he said,\r\n'and know Wordsworth perhaps as well as any one. Many a day I have\r\nwalked over the hills with him, and listened to his repetition of his\r\nown poetry, which, of course, filled my mind completely at the time,\r\nand perhaps started the poetical vein in me, though I cannot agree\r\nwith the critics that my poetry is an imitation of Wordsworth's.'\r\n\r\n'Did Wordsworth repeat any other poetry than his own?'\r\n\r\n'Never in a single instance, to my knowledge. He is remarkable for the\r\nmanner in which he is wrapped up in his own poetical life. Everything\r\nministers to it. Everything is done with reference to it. He is all\r\nand only a poet.'\r\n\r\n'What is Southey's manner of life?'\r\n\r\n'Walter Scott said of him that he lived too much with women. He is\r\nsecluded in the country, and surrounded by a circle of admiring\r\nfriends, who glorify every literary project he undertakes, and\r\npersuade him, in spite of his natural modesty, that he can do nothing\r\nwrong. He has great genius, and is a most estimable man.'\r\n\r\nOn the same day that he breakfasted with Wilson, this fortunate\r\ntourist dined with Jeffrey, with whom Lord Brougham was staying.\r\nUnluckily, Brougham was absent, at a public dinner given to Lord Grey,\r\nwho also happened to be in Edinburgh at the time. Willis was charmed\r\nwith Jeffrey, with his frank smile, hearty manner, and graceful style\r\nof putting a guest at his ease. But he cared less for the political\r\nconversation at table. 'It had been my lot,' he says, 'to be thrown\r\nprincipally among Tories (_Conservatives_ is the new name) since\r\nmy arrival in England, and it was difficult to rid myself at once of\r\nthe impressions of a fortnight passed in the castle of a Tory earl. My\r\nsympathies on the great and glorious occasion [the Whig dinner to Lord\r\nGrey] were slower than those of the rest of the company, and much of\r\ntheir enthusiasm seemed to me overstrained. Altogether, I entered less\r\ninto the spirit of the hour than I could have wished. Politics are\r\nseldom witty or amusing; and though I was charmed with the good sense\r\nand occasional eloquence of Lord Jeffrey, I was glad to get upstairs\r\nto _chasse-café_ and the ladies.'\r\n\r\nWillis aggravated a temporary lameness by dancing at the ball that\r\nfollowed the Whig banquet, and was compelled to abandon a charming\r\nland-route north that he had mapped out, and allow himself to be taken\r\n'this side up' on a steamer to Aberdeen. Here he took coach for\r\nFochabers, and thence posted to Gordon Castle. At the castle he found\r\nhimself in the midst of a most distinguished company; the page who\r\nshowed him to his room running over the names of Lord Aberdeen and\r\nLord Claude Hamilton, the Duchess of Richmond and her daughter, Lady\r\nSophia Lennox, Lord and Lady Stormont, Lord and Lady Mandeville, Lord\r\nand Lady Morton, Lord Aboyne, Lady Keith, and twenty other lesser\r\nlights. The duke himself came to fetch his guest before dinner, and\r\npresented him to the duchess and the rest of the party. In a letter to\r\nLady Blessington Willis says: 'I am delighted with the duke and\r\nduchess. He is a delightful, hearty old fellow, full of fun and\r\nconversation, and she is an uncommonly fine woman, and, without\r\nbeauty, has something agreeable in her countenance. _Pour\r\nmoi-méme_, I get on better everywhere than in your presence. I only\r\nfear I talk too much; but all the world is particularly civil to me,\r\nand among a score of people, no one of whom I had ever seen yesterday,\r\nI find myself quite at home to-day.'\r\n\r\nThe ten days at Gordon Castle Willis afterwards set apart in his\r\nmemory as 'a bright ellipse in the usual procession of joys and\r\nsorrows.' He certainly made the most of this unique opportunity of\r\nobserving the manners and customs of the great. The routine of life at\r\nthe castle was what each guest chose to make it. 'Between breakfast\r\nand lunch,' he writes, 'the ladies were usually invisible, and the\r\ngentlemen rode, or shot, or played billiards. At two o'clock a dish or\r\ntwo of hot game and a profusion of cold meats were set on small\r\ntables, and everybody came in for a kind of lounging half meal, which\r\noccupied perhaps an hour. Thence all adjourned to the drawing-room,\r\nunder the windows of which were drawn up carriages of all\r\ndescriptions, with grooms, outriders, footmen, and saddle-horses for\r\ngentlemen and ladies. Parties were then made up for driving or riding,\r\nand from a pony-chaise to a phaeton and four, there was no class of\r\nvehicle that was not at your disposal. In ten minutes the carriages\r\nwere all filled, and away they flew, some to the banks of the Spey or\r\nthe seaside, some to the drives in the park, and all with the\r\ndelightful consciousness that speed where you would, the horizon\r\nscarce limited the possessions of your host, and you were everywhere\r\nat home. The ornamental gates flying open at your approach; the herds\r\nof red deer trooping away from the sound of your wheels; the stately\r\npheasants feeding tamely in the immense preserves; the stalking\r\ngamekeepers lifting their hats in the dark recesses of the\r\nforest--there was something in this perpetual reminder of your\r\nprivileges which, as a novelty, was far from disagreeable. I could\r\nnot, at the time, bring myself to feel, what perhaps would be more\r\npoetical and republican, that a ride in the wild and unfenced forest\r\nof my own country would have been more to my taste.'\r\n\r\nWillis came to the conclusion that a North American Indian, in his\r\nmore dignified phase, closely resembled an English nobleman in manner,\r\nsince it was impossible to astonish either. All violent sensations, he\r\nobserves, are avoided in high life. 'In conversation nothing is so\r\n\"odd\" (a word that in English means everything disagreeable) as\r\nemphasis, or a startling epithet, or gesture, and in common\r\nintercourse nothing is so vulgar as any approach to \"a scene.\" For all\r\nextraordinary admiration, the word \"capital\" suffices; for all\r\nordinary praise, the word \"nice\"; for all condemnation in morals,\r\nmanners, or religion, the word \"odd.\".... What is called an\r\noverpowering person is immediately shunned, for he talks too much, and\r\nexcites too much attention. In any other country he would be\r\nconsidered amusing. He is regarded here as a monopoliser of the\r\ngeneral interest, and his laurels, talk he never so well, overshadow\r\nthe rest of the company.'\r\n\r\nOn leaving Gordon Castle, Willis crossed Scotland by the Caledonian\r\nCanal, and from Fort William jolted in a Highland cart through Glencoe\r\nto Tarbet on Lomond. Thence the regulation visits were paid to Loch\r\nKatrine, the Trossachs and Callander. Another stay at Dalhousie Castle\r\ngave the tourist an opportunity of seeing Abbotsford, where he heard\r\nmuch talk of Sir Walter Scott. Lord Dalhousie had many anecdotes to\r\ntell of Scott's school-days, and Willis recalled some reminiscences of\r\nthe Wizard that he had heard from Moore in London. 'Scott was the soul\r\nof honesty,' Moore had said. 'When I was on a visit to him, we were\r\ncoming up from Kelso at sunset, and as there was to be a fine moon, I\r\nquoted to him his own rule for seeing \"fair Melrose aright,\" and\r\nproposed to stay an hour and enjoy it. \"Bah,\" said Scott. \"I never saw\r\nit by moonlight.\" We went, however, and Scott, who seemed to be on the\r\nmost familiar terms with the cicerone, pointed to an empty niche, and\r\nsaid to him: \"I think I have a Virgin and Child that will just do for\r\nyour niche. I'll send it to you.\" \"How happy you have made that man,\"\r\nI said. \"Oh,\" said Scott, \"it was always in the way, and Madam Scott\r\nis constantly grudging it house-room. We're well rid of it.\" Any other\r\nman would have allowed himself at least the credit of a kind action.'\r\n\r\nAfter a stay at a Lancashire country-house, Willis arrived at\r\nLiverpool, where he got his first sight of the newly-opened railway to\r\nManchester. In the letters and journals of the period, it is rather\r\nunusual to come upon any allusion to the great revolution in\r\nland-travelling. We often read of our grandfathers' astonishment at\r\nthe steam-packets that crossed the Atlantic in a fortnight, but they\r\nseem to have slid into the habit of travelling by rail almost as a\r\nmatter of course, much as their descendants have taken to touring in\r\nmotor-cars. Willis the observant, however, has left on record his\r\nsensations during his first journey by rail.\r\n\r\n'Down we dived into the long tunnel,' he relates, 'emerging from the\r\ndarkness at a pace that made my hair sensibly tighten, and hold on\r\nwith apprehension. Thirty miles in the hour is pleasant going when one\r\nis a little accustomed to it, it gives one such a pleasant contempt\r\nfor time and distance. The whizzing past of the return trains, going\r\nin the opposite direction with the same degree of velocity--making you\r\nrecoil in one second, and a mile off the next--was the only thing\r\nwhich, after a few minutes, I did not take to very kindly.'\r\n\r\nWillis adds to our obligations by reporting the cries of the newsboys\r\nat the Elephant and Castle, where all the coaches to and from the\r\nSouth stopped for twenty minutes. On the occasion that our traveller\r\npassed through, the boys were crying 'Noospipper, sir! Buy the morning\r\npippers, sir! _Times, Herald, Chrinnicle,_ and _Munning Post_,\r\nsir--contains Lud Brum's entire innihalation of Lud Nummanby--Ledy\r\nFlor 'Estings' murder by Lud Melbun and the Maids of Honour--debate\r\non the Croolty-Hannimals Bill, and a fatil catstrophy in conskens\r\nof loosfer matches! Sixpence, only sixpence!'\r\n\r\nIn November Willis returned to London, and took lodgings in Vigo\r\nStreet. During the next ten months he seems to have done a good deal\r\nof work for the magazines, and to have been made much of in society as\r\na literary celebrity. His stories and articles, which appeared in the\r\n_New Monthly Magazine_ under the pseudonym of Philip Slingsby,\r\nwere eagerly read by the public of that day. He was presented at\r\ncourt, admitted to the Athenacum and Travellers' Clubs, and patronised\r\nby Lady Charlotte Bury and Lady Stepney, ladies who were in the habit\r\nof writing bad novels, and giving excellent dinners. Madden, Lady\r\nBlessington's biographer, who saw a good deal of Willis at this time,\r\nsays that he was an extremely agreeable young man, somewhat\r\nover-dressed, and a little too _démonstratif_, but abounding in\r\ngood spirits. 'He was observant and communicative, lively and clever\r\nin conversation, having the peculiar art of making himself agreeable\r\nto ladies, old and young, _dégagé_ in his manner, and on exceedingly\r\ngood terms with himself.'\r\n\r\nNot only had Willis the _entrée_ into fashionable Bohemia, but he\r\nwas well received in many families of unquestionable respectability.\r\nElderly and middle-aged ladies were especially attracted by his\r\nflattering attentions and deferential manners, and at this time two of\r\nhis most devoted friends were Mrs. Shaw of the Manor House, Lee, a\r\ndaughter of Lord Erskine, and Mrs. Skinner of Shirley Park, the wife\r\nof an Indian nabob. Their houses were always open to him, and he says\r\nin a letter to his mother: 'I have two homes in England where I am\r\nloved like a child. I had a letter from Mrs. Shaw, who thought I\r\nlooked low-spirited at the opera the other night. \"Young men have but\r\ntwo causes of unhappiness,\" she writes, \"love and money. If it is\r\n_money_, Mr. Shaw wishes me to say you shall have as much as you\r\nwant; if it is _love_, tell us the lady, and perhaps we can help\r\nyou.\" I spend my Sundays alternately at their splendid country-house,\r\nand at Mrs. Skinner's, and they can never get enough of me. I am often\r\nasked if I carry a love-philter with me.'\r\n\r\nAt Shirley Park, Willis struck up a friendship with Jane Porter, and\r\nmade the acquaintance of Lady Morgan, Praed, John Leech, and Martin\r\nTupper. Mrs. Skinner professed to be extremely anxious to find him a\r\nsuitable wife, and in a confidential letter to her, he writes: 'You\r\nsay if you had a daughter you would give her to me. If you _had_\r\none, I should certainly take you at your word, provided this\r\n_exposé_ of my poverty did not change your fancy. I should like\r\nto marry in England, and I feel every day that my best years and best\r\naffections are running to waste. I am proud to _be_ an American,\r\nbut as a literary man, I would rather _live_ in England. So if\r\nyou know of any affectionate and _good_ girl who would be content\r\nto live a quiet life, and could love your humble servant, you have\r\nfull power to dispose of me, _provided_ she has five hundred a\r\nyear, or as much more as she likes. I know enough of the world to cut\r\nmy throat, rather than bring a delicate woman down to a dependence on\r\nmy brains for support.'\r\n\r\nIn March of this year, 1835, Willis produced his _Melanie, and other\r\nPoems_, which was 'edited' by Barry Cornwall. He received the\r\nhonour of a parody in the _Bon Gaultier Ballads_, entitled 'The\r\nFight with the Snapping Turtle, or the American St. George.' In this\r\nballad Willis and Bryant are represented as setting out to kill the\r\nSnapping Turtle, spurred on by the offer of a hundred dollars reward.\r\nThe turtle swallows Willis, but is thereupon taken ill, and having\r\nreturned him to earth again, dies in great agony. When he claims the\r\nreward, he is informed that:--\r\n\r\n   'Since you dragged the tarnal crittur\r\n    From the bottom of the ponds,\r\n    Here's the hundred dollars due you\r\n    _All in Pennsylvanian bonds._'\r\n\r\nAt the end of the poem is a drawing of a pair of stocks, labelled 'The\r\nonly good American securities,' Willis seems to have been too busy to\r\nBoswellise this season, but we get a glimpse of him in his letters to\r\nMiss Mitford, and one or two of the notes in his diary are worth\r\nquoting. On April 22 he writes to the author of _Our Village_ in\r\nhis usual flattering style: 'I am anxious to see your play and your\r\nnext book, and I quite agree with you that the drama is your\r\n_pied_, though I think laurels, and spreading ones, are sown for\r\nyou in every department of writing. Nobody ever wrote better prose,\r\nand what could not the author of _Rienzi_ do in verse. For\r\nmyself, I am far from considering myself regularly embarked in\r\nliterature, and if I can live without it, or ply any other vocation,\r\nshall vote it a thankless trade, and save my \"entusymussy\" for my wife\r\nand children--when I get them. I am at present steeped to the lips in\r\nLondon society, going to everything, from Devonshire House to a\r\npublisher's dinner in Paternoster Row, and it is not a bad _olla\r\npodrida_ of life and manners. I dote on \"England and true English,\"\r\nand was never so happy, or so at a loss to find a minute for care or\r\nforethought.'\r\n\r\nIn his diary for June 30, Willis notes: 'Breakfasted with Samuel\r\nRogers. Talked of Mrs. Butler's book, and Rogers gave us suppressed\r\npassages. Talked critics, and said that as long as you cast a shadow,\r\nyou were sure that you possessed substance. Coleridge said of Southey,\r\n\"I never think of him but as mending a pen.\" Southey said of\r\nColeridge, \"Whenever anything presents itself to him in the form of a\r\nduty, that moment he finds himself incapable of looking at it.\"' On\r\nJuly 9 we have the entry: 'Dined with Dr. Beattie, and met Thomas\r\nCampbell.... He spoke of Scott's slavishness to men of rank, but said\r\nit did not interfere with his genius. Said it sunk a man's heart to\r\nthink that he and Byron were dead, and there was nobody left to praise\r\nor approve.... He told a story of dining with Burns and a Bozzy\r\nfriend, who, when Campbell proposed the health of _Mr_. Burns,\r\nsaid, \"Sir, you will always be known as _Mr_. Campbell, but\r\nposterity will talk of _Burns_.\" He was playful and amusing, and\r\ndrank gin and water.'\r\n\r\nWhile staying with the Skinners in August, Willis met his fate in the\r\nperson of Miss Mary Stace, daughter of a General Stace. After a week's\r\nacquaintance he proposed to her, and was accepted. She was, we are\r\ntold, a beauty of the purest Saxon type, with a bright complexion,\r\nblue eyes, light-brown hair, and delicate, regular features. Her\r\ndisposition was clinging and affectionate, and she had enjoyed the\r\nreligious bringing up that her lover thought of supreme importance to\r\na woman. General Stace agreed to allow his daughter £300 a year, which\r\nwith the £400 that Willis made by his pen, was considered a sufficient\r\nincome for the young couple to start housekeeping upon.\r\n\r\nWillis, who had promised to pay Miss Mitford a visit in the autumn,\r\nwrites to her on September 22, to explain that all his plans were\r\naltered. 'Just before starting with Miss Jane Porter on a tour that\r\nwas to include Reading,' he says, 'I went to a picnic, fell in love\r\nwith a blue-eyed girl, and (after running the gauntlet successfully\r\nthrough France, Italy, Greece, Germany, Asia Minor, and Turkey) I\r\nrenewed my youth, and became \"a suitor for love.\" I am to be married\r\n(_sequitur_) on Thursday week.... The lady who is to take me, as\r\nthe Irish say, \"in a present,\" is some six years younger than myself,\r\ngentle, religious, relying, and unambitious. She has never been\r\nwhirled through the gay society of London, so is not giddy or vain.\r\nShe has never swum in a gondola, or written a sonnet, so has a proper\r\nrespect for those who have. She is called pretty, but is more than\r\nthat in _my_ eyes; sings as if her heart were hid in her lips,\r\nand _loves_ me.... We are bound to Paris for a month (because I\r\nthink amusement better than reflection when a woman makes a doubtful\r\nbargain), and by November we return to London for the winter, and in\r\nthe spring sail for America to see my mother. I have promised to live\r\nmainly on this side of the water, and shall return in the course of a\r\nyear to try what contentment may be sown and reaped in a green lane in\r\nKent.'\r\n\r\nWhile the happy pair were on their honeymoon, Lady Blessington had\r\nundertaken to see the _Pencillings by the Way_ through the press.\r\nFor the first edition Willis received £250, but he made, from first to\r\nlast, about a thousand pounds by the book. Its appearance in volume\r\nform had been anticipated by Lockhart's scathing review in the\r\n_Quarterly_ for September 1835. The critic, annoyed at Willis's\r\nstrictures on himself in the interview with Professor Wilson, attacked\r\nthe _Pencillings_, as they had appeared in the _New York Mirror_,\r\nwith all proper names printed in full, and many personal\r\ndetails that were left out in the English edition. Lockhart always\r\nknew how to stab a man in the tenderest place, and he stabbed Willis\r\nin his gentility. After pointing out that while visiting in London and\r\nthe provinces as a young American sonneteer of the most\r\nultra-sentimental delicacy, the Penciller was all the time the regular\r\npaid correspondent of a New York Journal, he observes that the letters\r\nderive their powers of entertainment chiefly from the light that they\r\nreflect upon the manners and customs of the author's own countrymen,\r\nsince, from his sketches of English interiors, the reader may learn\r\nwhat American breakfast, dinners, and table-talk are _not_; or at\r\nall events what they were not in those circles of American society\r\nwith which the writer happened to be familiar.\r\n\r\n'Many of _this person's_ discoveries,' continues Lockhart,\r\nwarming to his work, 'will be received with ridicule in his own\r\ncountry, where the doors of the best houses were probably not opened\r\nto him as liberally as those of the English nobility. In short, we are\r\napt to consider him as a just representative--not of the American mind\r\nand manners generally--but only of the young men of fair education\r\namong the busy, middling orders of mercantile cities. In his letters\r\nfrom Gordon Castle there are bits of solid, full-grown impudence and\r\nimpertinence; while over not a few of the paragraphs is a varnish of\r\nconceited vulgarity which is too ludicrous to be seriously\r\noffensive.... We can well believe that Mr. Willis depicted the sort of\r\nsociety that most interests his countrymen, \"born to be slaves and\r\nstruggling to be lords,\" their servile adulation of rank and talent;\r\ntheir stupid admiration of processions and levees, are leading\r\nfeatures of all the American books of travel.... We much doubt if all\r\nthe pretty things we have quoted will so far propitiate Lady\r\nBlessington as to make her again admit to her table the animal who has\r\nprinted what ensues. [Here follows the report of Moore's conversation\r\non the subject of O'Connell.] As far as we are acquainted with English\r\nor American literature, this is the first example of a man creeping\r\ninto your home, and forthwith, before your claret is dry on his lips,\r\nprinting _table-talk on delicate subjects, and capable of\r\ncompromising individuals_.'\r\n\r\nThe _Quarterly_ having thus given the lead, the rest of the Tory\r\nmagazines gaily followed suit. Maginn flourished his shillelagh, and\r\nbelaboured his victim with a brutality that has hardly ever been\r\nequalled, even by the pioneer journals of the Wild West. 'This is a\r\ngoose of a book,' he begins, 'or if anybody wishes the idiom changed,\r\nthe book of a goose. There is not an idea in it beyond what might\r\ngerminate in the brain of a washerwoman.' He then proceeds to call the\r\nauthor by such elegant names as 'lickspittle,' 'beggarly skittler,'\r\njackass, ninny, haberdasher, 'fifty-fifth rate scribbler of\r\ngripe-visited sonnets,' and 'namby-pamby writer in twaddling albums\r\nkept by the mustachioed widows or bony matrons of Portland Place.'\r\n\r\nThe people whose hospitality Willis was accused of violating wrote to\r\nassure him of the pleasure his book had given them. Lord Dalhousie\r\nwrites: 'We all agree in one sentiment, that a more amusing and\r\ndelightful production was never issued by the press. The Duke and\r\nDuchess of Gordon were here lately, and expressed themselves in\r\nsimilar terms.' Lady Blessington did not withdraw her friendship, but\r\nWillis admits, in one of his letters, that he had no deeper regret\r\nthan that his indiscretion should have checked the freedom of his\r\napproach to her. As a result of the slashing reviews, the book sold\r\nwith the readiness of a _succés de scandale_, though it had been\r\nso rigorously edited for the English market, that very few\r\nindiscretions were left.\r\n\r\nThe unexpurgated version of the _Pencillings_ was, however,\r\ncopied into the English papers and eagerly read by the persons most\r\nconcerned, such as Fonblanque, who bitterly complained of the libel\r\nupon his personal appearance, O'Connell, who broke off his lifelong\r\nfriendship with Moore, and Captain Marryat, who was furious at the\r\nremark that his 'gross trash' sold immensely in Wapping. Like\r\nLockhart, he revenged himself by an article in his own magazine, the\r\n_Metropolitan_, in which he denounced Willis as a 'spurious\r\nattaché,' and made dark insinuations against his birth and parentage.\r\nThis attack was too personal to be ignored. Willis demanded an\r\napology, to which Marryat replied with a challenge, and after a long\r\ncorrespondence, most of which found its way into the _Times_, a\r\nduel was fixed to take place at Chatham. At the last moment the\r\nseconds managed to arrange matters between their principals, and the\r\naffair ended without bloodshed. This was fortunate for Willis, who was\r\nlittle used to fire-arms, whilst Marryat was a crack shot.\r\n\r\nIn his preface to the first edition of the _Pencillings_ Willis\r\nexplains that the ephemeral nature and usual obscurity of periodical\r\ncorrespondence gave a sufficient warrant to his mind that his\r\ndescriptions would die where they first saw the light, and that\r\ntherefore he had indulged himself in a freedom of detail and topic\r\nonly customary in posthumous memoirs. He expresses his astonishment\r\nthat this particular sin should have been visited upon him at a\r\ndistance of three thousand miles, when the _Quarterly_ reviewer's\r\nown fame rested on the more aggravated instance of a book of\r\npersonalities published under the very noses of the persons described\r\n(_Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk_). After observing that he was\r\nlittle disposed to find fault, since everything in England pleased\r\nhim, he proceeds: 'In one single instance I indulged myself in\r\nstrictures upon individual character.... I but repeated what I had\r\nsaid a thousand times, and never without an indignant echo to its\r\ntruth, that the editor of that Review was the most unprincipled critic\r\nof the age. Aside from its flagrant literary injustice, we owe to the\r\n_Quarterly_ every spark of ill-feeling that has been kept alive\r\nbetween England and America for the last twenty years. The sneers, the\r\nopprobrious epithets of this bravo of literature have been received in\r\na country where the machinery of reviewing was not understood, as the\r\nvoice of the English people, and animosity for which there was no\r\nother reason has been thus periodically fed and exasperated. I\r\nconceive it to be my duty as a literary man--I _know_ it is my\r\nduty as an American--to lose no opportunity of setting my heel on this\r\nreptile of criticism. He has turned and stung me. Thank God, I have\r\nescaped the slime of his approbation.'\r\n\r\nThe winter was spent in London, and in the following March Willis\r\nbrought out his _Inklings of Adventure_, a reprint of the stories\r\nthat had appeared in various magazines over the signature of Philip\r\nSlingsby. These were supposed to be real adventures under a thin\r\ndisguise of fiction, and the public eagerly read the tawdry little\r\ntales in the hope of discovering the identities of the _dramatis\r\npersonæ_. The majority of the 'Inklings' deal with the romantic\r\nadventures of a young literary man who wins the affection of high-born\r\nladies, and is made much of in aristrocratic circles. The author\r\nrevels in descriptions of luxurious boudoirs in which recline\r\nvoluptuous blondes or exquisite brunettes, with hearts always at the\r\ndisposal of the all-conquering Philip Slingsby. Fashionable fiction,\r\nhowever, was unable to support the expense of a fashionable\r\nestablishment, and in May 1836 the couple sailed for America. Willis\r\nhoped to obtain a diplomatic appointment, and return to Europe for\r\ngood, but all his efforts were vain, and he was obliged to rely on his\r\npen for a livelihood. His first undertaking was the letterpress for an\r\nillustrated volume on American scenery; and for some months he\r\ntravelled about the country with the artist who was responsible for\r\nthe illustrations. On one of his journeys he fell in love with a\r\npretty spot on the banks of the Owego Creek, near the junction with\r\nthe Susquehanna, and bought a couple of hundred acres and a house,\r\nwhich he named Glenmary after his wife.\r\n\r\nHere the pair settled down happily for some five years, and here\r\nWillis wrote his pleasant, gossiping _Letters from Under a\r\nBridge_ for the _New York Mirror_. In these he prattled of his\r\ngarden, his farm, his horses and dogs, and the strangers within his\r\ngates. Unfortunately, he was unable to devote much attention to his\r\nfarm, which was said to grow nothing but flowers of speed, but was\r\nforced to spend more and more time in the editorial office, and to\r\nwrite hastily and incessantly for a livelihood. In 1839, owing to a\r\ntemporary coolness with the proprietor of the _Mirror_, Willis\r\naccepted the proposal of his friend, Dr. Porter, that he should start\r\na new weekly paper called the _Corsair_, one of a whole crop of\r\npirate weeklies that started up with the establishment of the first\r\nservice of Atlantic liners. In May 1839 the first steam-vessel that\r\nhad crossed the ocean anchored in New York Harbour, and thenceforward\r\nit was possible to obtain supplies from the European literary markets\r\nwithin a fortnight of publication. It was arranged between Dr. Parker\r\nand Willis that the cream of the contemporary literature of England,\r\nFrance, and Germany should be conveyed to the readers of the\r\n_Corsair_, and of course there was no question of payment to the\r\nauthors whose wares were thus appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe first number of the _Corsair_ appeared in January 1839, but\r\napparently piracy was not always a lucrative trade, for the paper had\r\nan existence of little more than a year. In the course of its brief\r\ncareer, however, Willis paid a flying visit to England, where he\r\naccomplished a great deal of literary business. He had written a play\r\ncalled _The Usurer Matched_, which was brought out by Wallack at\r\nthe Surrey Theatre, and is said to have been played to crowded houses\r\nduring a fairly long run, but neither this nor any of his other plays\r\nbrought the author fame or fortune. During this season he published\r\nhis _Loiterings of Travel_, a collection of stories and sketches,\r\na fourth edition of the _Pencillings_, an English edition of\r\n_Letters from Under a Bridge_, and arranged with Virtue for works\r\non Irish and Canadian scenery. In addition to all this, he was\r\ncontributing jottings in London to the _Corsair_. As might be\r\nsupposed, he had not much time for society, but he met a few old\r\nfriends, made acquaintance with Kemble and Kean, went to a ball at\r\nAlmack's, and was present at the famous Eglinton Tournament, which\r\nwatery catastrophe he described for his paper. One of the most\r\ninteresting of his new acquaintances was Thackeray, then chiefly\r\nrenowned as a writer for the magazines. On July 26 Willis writes to\r\nDr. Porter:--\r\n\r\n'I have engaged a new contributor to the _Corsair_. Who do you\r\nthink? The author of _Yellowplush_ and _Major Gahagan_. He has\r\ngone to Paris, and will write letters from there, and afterwards\r\nfrom London for a guinea a _close_ column of the _Corsair_--cheaper\r\nthan I ever did anything in my life. For myself, I think him the\r\nvery best periodical writer alive. He is a royal, daring, fine\r\ncreature too.' In his published _Jottings_, Willis told his readers\r\nthat 'Mr. Thackeray, the author, breakfasted with me yesterday,\r\nand the _Corsair_ will be delighted to hear that I have  engaged\r\nthis cleverest and most gifted of all the magazine-writers of\r\nLondon to become _a regular correspondent of the Corsair_....\r\nThackeray is a tall, athletic-looking man of about forty-five\r\n[he was actually only eight-and-twenty], with a look of talent that\r\ncould never be mistaken. He is one of the most accomplished\r\ndraughtsmen in England, as well as the most brilliant of\r\nperiodical writers.' Thackeray only wrote eight letters for the\r\n_Corsair_, which were afterwards republished in his _Paris\r\nSketch-book_. There is an allusion to this episode in _The\r\nAdventures of Philip_, the hero being invited to contribute to a\r\nNew York journal called _The Upper Ten Thousand_, a phrase\r\ninvented by Willis.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Corsair_ came to an untimely end, Willis had no\r\ndifficulty in finding employment on other papers. He is said to have\r\nbeen the first American magazine-writer who was tolerably well paid,\r\nand at one time he was making about a thousand a year by periodical\r\nwork. That his name was already celebrated among his own countrymen\r\nseems to be proved by the story of a commercial gentleman at a Boston\r\ntea-party who 'guessed that Goethe was the N.P. Willis of Germany.'\r\nThe tales written about this time were afterwards collected into a\r\nvolume called _Dashes at Life with a Free Pencil_. Thackeray made\r\ngreat fun of this work in the _Edinburgh Review_ for October\r\n1845, more especially of that portion called 'The Heart-book of Ernest\r\nClay.' 'Like Caesar,' observed Thackeray, 'Ernest Clay is always\r\nwriting of his own victories. Duchesses pine for him, modest virgins\r\ngo into consumption and die for him, old grandmothers of sixty forget\r\ntheir families and their propriety, and fall on the neck of this \"Free\r\nPencil.\"' He quotes with delight the description of a certain Lady\r\nMildred, one of Ernest Clay's numerous loves, who glides into the room\r\nat a London tea-party, 'with a step as elastic as the nod of a\r\nwater-lily. A snowy turban, from which hung on either temple a cluster\r\nof crimson camellias still wet with the night-dew; long raven curls of\r\nundisturbed grace falling on shoulders of that indescribable and dewy\r\ncoolness which follows a morning bath.' How naively, comments the\r\ncritic, does this nobleman of nature recommend the use of this rare\r\ncosmetic!\r\n\r\nIn spite of his popularity, Willis's affairs were not prospering at\r\nthis time. He had received nothing from the estate of his\r\nfather-in-law, who died in 1839, his publisher failed in 1842, and he\r\nwas obliged to sell Glenmary and remove to New York, whence he had\r\nundertaken to send a fortnightly letter to a paper at Washington. This\r\nwas the year of Dickens's visit to America, and Willis was present at\r\nthe 'Boz Ball,' where he danced with Mrs. Dickens, to whom he\r\nafterwards did the honours of Broadway. In 1843 Willis made up his\r\ndifference with Morris, and again became joint-editor of the\r\n_Mirror_, which, a year later, was changed from a weekly to a\r\ndaily paper. His contributions to the journal consisted of stories,\r\npoems, letters, book-notices, answers to correspondents, and editorial\r\ngossip of all kinds.\r\n\r\nIn March 1845 Mrs. Willis died in her confinement, leaving her\r\n(temporarily) broken-hearted husband with one little girl. 'An angel\r\nwithout fault or foible' was his epitaph upon the woman to whom, in\r\nspite of his many fictitious _bonnes fortunes_, he is said to\r\nhave been faithfully attached. But Willis was not born to live alone,\r\nand in the following summer he fell in love with a Miss Cornelia\r\nGrinnell at Washington, and was married to her in October, 1846. The\r\nsecond Mrs. Willis was nearly twenty years younger than her husband,\r\nbut she was a sensible, energetic young woman, who made him an\r\nexcellent wife.\r\n\r\nThe title of the _Mirror_ had been changed to that of _The Home\r\nJournal_, and under its new name it became a prosperous paper.\r\nWillis, who was the leading spirit of the enterprise, set himself to\r\nportray the town, chronicling plays, dances, picture-exhibitions,\r\nsights and entertainments of all kinds in the airy manner that was so\r\nkeenly appreciated by his countrymen. He was recognised as an\r\nauthority on fashion, and his correspondence columns were crowded with\r\nappeals for guidance in questions of dress and etiquette. He was also\r\na favourite in general society, though he is said to have been, next\r\nto Fenimore Cooper, the best-abused man of letters in America. One of\r\nhis most pleasing characteristics was his ready appreciation and\r\nencouragement of young writers, for he was totally free from\r\nprofessional jealousy. He was the literary sponsor of Aldrich, Bayard\r\nTaylor, and Lowell, among others, and the last-named alludes to Willis\r\nin his _Fable for Critics_ (1848) in the following flattering\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n   'His nature's a glass of champagne with the foam on't,\r\n   As tender as Fletcher, as witty as Beaumont;\r\n   So his best things are done in the heat of the moment.\r\n     *       *        *        *       *\r\n   He'd have been just the fellow to sup at the 'Mermaid,'\r\n   Cracking jokes at rare Ben, with an eye to the barmaid,\r\n   His wit running up as Canary ran down,--\r\n   The topmost bright bubble on the wave of the town.'\r\n\r\nAfter 1846 Willis wrote little except gossiping paragraphs and other\r\nephemera. In answer to remonstrances against this method of frittering\r\naway his talents, he was accustomed to reply that the public liked\r\ntrifles, and that he was bound to go on 'buttering curiosity with the\r\nooze of his brains.' He read but little in later life, nor associated\r\nwith men of high intellect or serious aims, but showed an\r\never-increasing preference for the frivolous and the feminine. In 1850\r\nhe published another volume of little magazine stories called\r\n_People I have Met_. This appeared in London as well as in New\r\nYork, and Thackeray again revenged himself for that close column which\r\nhad been rewarded by an uncertain guinea, by holding up his former\r\neditor to ridicule. With mischievous delight he describes the\r\namusement that is to be found in N.P. Willis's society, 'amusement at\r\nthe immensity of N.P.'s blunders; amusement at the prodigiousness of\r\nhis self-esteem; amusement always with or at Willis the poet, Willis\r\nthe man, Willis the dandy, Willis the lover--now the Broadway\r\nCrichton--once the ruler of fashion and heart-enslaver of Bond Street,\r\nand the Boulevard, and the Corso, and the Chiaja, and the\r\nConstantinople Bazaars. It is well for the general peace of families\r\nthat the world does not produce many such men; there would be no\r\nkeeping our wives and daughters in their senses were such fascinators\r\nto make frequent apparitions among us; but it is comfortable that\r\nthere should have been a Willis; and as a literary man myself, and\r\nanxious for the honour of that profession, I am proud to think that a\r\nman of our calling should have come, should have seen, should have\r\nconquered as Willis has done.... There is more or less of truth, he\r\nnobly says, in these stories--more or less truth, to be sure there\r\nis--and it is on account of this more or less truth that I for my part\r\nlove and applaud this hero and poet. We live in our own country, and\r\ndon't know it; Willis walks into it, and dominates it at once. To know\r\na duchess, for instance, is given to very few of us. He sees things\r\nthat are not given to us to see. We see the duchess in her carriage,\r\nand gaze with much reverence on the strawberry-leaves on the panels,\r\nand her grace within; whereas the odds are that that lovely duchess\r\nhas had, one time or the other, a desperate flirtation with Willis the\r\nConqueror. Perhaps she is thinking of him at this very moment, as her\r\njewelled hand presses her perfumed handkerchief to her fair and\r\ncoroneted brow, and she languidly stops to purchase a ruby bracelet at\r\nGunter's, or to sip an ice at Howell and James's. He must have whole\r\nmattresses stuffed with the blonde or raven or auburn tresses of\r\nEngland's fairest daughters. When the female English aristocracy read\r\nthe title of _People I have Met_, I can fancy the whole female\r\npeerage of Willis's time in a shudder; and the melancholy marchioness,\r\nand the abandoned countess, and the heart-stricken baroness trembling\r\nas each gets the volume, and asks of her guilty conscience, \"Gracious\r\ngoodness, is the monster going to show up me?\"'\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Willis, who had been obliged to travel for the benefit of his\r\ndeclining health, took a fancy to the neighbourhood of the Hudson, and\r\nbought fifty acres of waste land, upon which he built himself a house,\r\nand called the place Idlewild. Here he settled down once more to a\r\nquiet country life, took care of his health, cultivated his garden,\r\nand wrote long weekly letters to the _Home Journal_. He had by\r\nthis time five children, middle age had stolen upon him, and now that\r\nhe could no longer pose as his own allconquering hero, his hand seems\r\nto have lost its cunning. His editorial articles, afterwards published\r\nunder the appropriate title of _Ephemera_, grew thinner and\r\nflatter with the passing of the years; yet slight and superficial as\r\nthe best of them are, they were the result of very hard writing. His\r\nmanuscripts were a mass of erasures and interlineations, but his copy\r\nwas so neatly prepared that even the erasures had a sort of 'wavy\r\nelegance' which the compositors actually preferred to print. His\r\nmannerisms and affectations grew upon him in his later years, and he\r\nbecame more and more addicted to the coining of new words and phrases,\r\nonly a few of which proved effective. Besides the now well-worn term,\r\nthe 'upper ten thousand,' he is credited with the invention of\r\n'Japonicadom,' 'come-at-able,' and 'stay-at-home-ativeness.' One or\r\ntwo of his sayings may be worth quoting, such as his request for\r\nWashington Irving's blotting-book, because it was the door-mat on\r\nwhich the thoughts of his last book had wiped their sandals before\r\nthey went in; and his remark that to ask a literary man to write a\r\nletter after his day's work was like asking a penny-postman to take a\r\nwalk in the evening for the pleasure of it.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Willis went to Washington as\r\nwar-correspondent of his paper. It does not appear that he saw any\r\nharder service than the dinners and receptions of the capitol, since\r\nan opportune fit of illness prevented his following the army to Bull's\r\nRun. The correspondent who took his place on the march had his career\r\ncut short by a Southern bullet. Willis, meanwhile, was driving about\r\nwith Mrs. Lincoln, with whom he became a favourite, although she\r\nreproached him for his want of tact in speaking of her 'motherly\r\nexpression' in one of his published letters, she being at that time\r\nonly thirty-six. He met Hawthorne at Washington, and describes him as\r\nvery shy and reserved in manner, but adds, 'I found he was a lover of\r\nmine, and we enjoyed our acquaintance very much.' One of the minor\r\nresults of the great Civil War was the extinguishing of Willis's\r\nliterary reputation; his frothy trifling suddenly became obsolete when\r\nmen had sterner things to think about than the cut of a coat, or the\r\netiquette of a morning call. The nation began to demand realities,\r\neven in its fiction, the circulation of the _Home Journal_ fell\r\noff, and Willis, who had always affected a horror of figures and\r\nbusiness matters generally, found himself in financial difficulties.\r\nHe was obliged to let Idlewild, and return, in spite of his rapidly\r\nfailing health, to the editorial office at New York.\r\n\r\nThe last few years of Willis's career afford a melancholy contrast to\r\nits brilliant opening. Health, success, prosperity--all had deserted\r\nhim, and nothing remained but the editorial chair, to which he clung\r\neven after epileptic attacks had resulted in paralysis and gradual\r\nsoftening of the brain. The failure of his mental powers was kept\r\nsecret as long as possible, but in November, 1866, he yielded to the\r\nentreaties of his wife and children, knocked off work for ever, and\r\nwent home to die. His last few months were passed in helpless\r\nweakness, and he only occasionally recognised those around him. The\r\nend came on January 20, 1867, his sixty-first birthday.\r\n\r\nSelections from Willis's prose works have been published within recent\r\nyears in America, and a new edition of his poems has appeared in\r\nEngland, while a carefully written Life by Mr. De Beers is included in\r\nthe series of 'American Men of Letters.' But in this country at least\r\nhis fame, such as it is, will rest upon his sketches of such\r\ncelebrities as Lamb, Moore, Bulwer, D'Orsay, and D'Israeli. As long as\r\nwe retain any interest in them and their works, we shall like to know\r\nhow they looked and dressed, and what they talked about in private\r\nlife. It is impossible altogether to approve of the Penciller--his\r\nabsurdities were too marked, and his indiscretions too many--yet it is\r\nprobable that few who have followed his meteor-like career will be\r\nable to refrain from echoing Thackeray's dictum: 'It is comfortable\r\nthat there should have been a Willis!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY HESTER STANHOPE\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady Hester Stanhope from a drawing by R. J. Hamerton]\r\n\r\nThere are few true stories that are distinguished by a well-marked\r\nmoral. If we study human chronicles we generally find the ungodly\r\nflourishing permanently like a green bay-tree, and the righteous\r\napparently forsaken and begging his bread. But it occasionally happens\r\nthat a human life illustrates some moral lesson with the triteness and\r\ncrudity of a Sunday-school book, and of such is the career of Lady\r\nHester Stanhope, a Pitt on the mother's side, and more of a Pitt in\r\ntemper and disposition than her grandfather, the great Commoner\r\nhimself. Her story contains the useful but conventional lesson that\r\npride goeth before a fall, and that all earthly glory is but vanity,\r\ntogether with a warning against the ambition that o'erleaps itself,\r\nand ends in failure and humiliation. That humanity will profit by such\r\na lesson, whether true or invented for didactic purposes, is doubtful,\r\nbut at least Nature has done her best for once to usurp the seat of\r\nthe preacher, 'to point a moral and adorn a tale.' Lady Hester, who\r\nwas born on March 12,1776, was the eldest daughter of Charles, third\r\nEarl of Stanhope, by his first wife Hester, daughter of the great Lord\r\nChatham. Lord Stanhope seems to have been an uncomfortable person, who\r\ncombined scientific research with democratic principles, and contrived\r\nto quarrel with most of his family. In order to live up to his\r\ntheories he laid down his carriage and horses, effaced the armorial\r\nbearings from his plate, and removed from his walls some famous\r\ntapestry, because it was 'so d----d aristocratical.' If one of his\r\ndaughters happened to look better than usual in a becoming hat or\r\nfrock, he had the garment laid away, and something coarse put in its\r\nplace. The children were left almost entirely to the care of\r\ngovernesses and tutors, their step-mother, the second Lady Stanhope (a\r\nGrenville by birth) being a fashionable fine lady, who devoted her\r\nwhole time to her social duties, while Lord Stanhope was absorbed by\r\nhis scientific pursuits. The home was not a happy one, either for the\r\nthree girls of the first marriage, or for the three sons of the\r\nsecond. In 1796 Rachel, the youngest daughter, eloped with a Sevenoaks\r\napothecary named Taylor, and was cast off by her family; and in 1800\r\nGriselda, the second daughter, married a Mr. Tekell, of Hampshire. In\r\nthis year Hester left her home, which George III used to call\r\nDemocracy Hall, and went to live with her grandmother, the Dowager\r\nLady Stanhope.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Lady Stanhope in 1803, Lady Hester was offered a home\r\nby her uncle, William Pitt, with whom she remained until his death in\r\n1806. Pitt became deeply attached to his handsome, high-spirited\r\nniece. He believed in her sincerity and affection for himself, admired\r\nher courage and cleverness, laughed at her temper, and encouraged her\r\npride. She seems to have gained a considerable influence over her\r\nuncle, and contrived to have a finger in most of the ministerial pies.\r\nWhen reproached for allowing her such unreserved liberty of action in\r\nstate affairs, Pitt was accustomed to reply, 'I let her do as she\r\npleases; for if she were resolved to cheat the devil himself, she\r\nwould do it.' 'And so I would,' Lady Hester used to add, when she told\r\nthe story. If we may believe her own account, Pitt told her that she\r\nwas fit to sit between Augustus and Mæcenas, and assured her that 'I\r\nhave plenty of good diplomatists, but they are none of them military\r\nmen; and I have plenty of good officers, but not one of them is worth\r\nsixpence in the cabinet. If you were a man, Hester, I would send you\r\non the Continent with 60,000 men, and give you _carte blanche_,\r\nand I am sure that not one of my plans would fail, and not one soldier\r\nwould go with his boots unblacked.' This admiration, according to the\r\nsame authority, was shared by George III, who one day on the Terrace\r\nat Windsor informed Mr. Pitt that he had got a new and superior\r\nminister in his room, and one, moreover, who was a good general.\r\n'There is my new minister,' he added, pointing at Lady Hester. 'There\r\nis not a man in my kingdom who is a better politician, and there is\r\nnot a woman who better adorns her sex. And let me say, Mr. Pitt, you\r\nhave not reason to be proud you are a minister, for there have been\r\nmany before you, and will be many after you; but you have reason to be\r\nproud of her, who unites everything that is great in man and woman.'\r\n\r\nAll this must, of course, be taken with grains of salt, but it is\r\ncertain that Lady Hester occupied a position of almost unparalleled\r\nsupremacy for a woman, that she dispensed patronage, lectured\r\nministers, and snubbed princes. On one occasion Lord Mulgrave, who had\r\njust been appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, found a\r\nbroken egg-spoon on the breakfast-table at Walmer, and asked, 'How can\r\nMr. Pitt have such a spoon as this?' 'Don't you know,' retorted Lady\r\nHester, 'that Mr. Pitt sometimes uses very slight and weak instruments\r\nwherewith to effect his ends?' Again, when Mr. Addington wished to\r\ntake the title of Lord Raleigh, Lady Hester determined to prevent what\r\nshe regarded as a desecration of a great name. She professed to have\r\nseen a caricature, which she minutely described, representing Mr.\r\nAddington as Sir Walter Raleigh, and the King as Queen Elizabeth. Mr.\r\nPitt, believing the story, repeated it to Addington and others, with\r\nthe result that messengers were despatched to all the print-shops to\r\nbuy up the whole impression. Of course no such caricature was to be\r\nfound, but the prospective peer had received a fright, and chose the\r\ninoffensive title of Lord Sidmouth. Lady Hester despised Lord\r\nLiverpool for a well-meaning blunderer, but she hated and distrusted\r\nCanning, whom she was accustomed to describe as a fiery, red-headed\r\nIrish politician, who was never staunch to any person or any party;\r\nand she declared that by her scoldings she had often made him blubber\r\nlike a schoolboy. It cannot be supposed that her ladyship was popular\r\nwith the numerous persons, high and low, who came under the ban of her\r\ndispleasure, or suffered from her pride; but she was young, handsome,\r\nand witty, her position was unassailable, and as long as her uncle\r\nchose to laugh at her insolence and her eccentricities, no lesser\r\npower presumed to frown.\r\n\r\nFor her beauty in youth we must again take her own account on trust,\r\nsince she never consented to sit for her portrait, and in old age her\r\nrecollection of her vanished charms may have been coloured by some\r\npardonable exaggeration. 'At twenty,' she told a chronicler, 'my\r\ncomplexion was like alabaster, and at five paces distant the sharpest\r\neyes could not discover my pearl necklace from my skin. My lips were\r\nof such a beautiful carnation that, without vanity, I can assure you,\r\nvery few women had the like. A dark-blue shade under the eyes, and the\r\nblue veins that were observable through the transparent skin,\r\nheightened the brilliancy of my features. Nor were the roses wanting\r\nin my cheeks; and to all this was added a permanency in my looks that\r\nno sort of fatigue could impair.' She was fond of relating an anecdote\r\nof a flattering impertinence on the part of Beau Brummell, who,\r\nmeeting her at a ball, coolly took the earrings out of her ears,\r\ntelling her that she should not wear such things, as they hid the fine\r\nturn of her cheek, and the set of head upon her neck. Lady Hester\r\nfrankly admitted, however, that it was her brilliant colouring that\r\nmade her beauty, and once observed, in reply to a compliment on her\r\nappearance: 'If you were to take every feature in my face, and lay\r\nthem one by one on the table, there is not a single one that would\r\nbear examination. The only thing is that, put together and lighted up,\r\nthey look well enough. It is homogeneous ugliness, and nothing more.'\r\n\r\nWith Pitt's death in January, 1806, as by the stroke of a magic wand,\r\nall the power, all the glory, and all the grandeur came to a sudden\r\nend, and the great minister's favourite niece fell to the level of a\r\nprivate lady, with a moderate income, no influence, and a host of\r\nenemies. On his deathbed, Pitt had asked that an annuity of £1500\r\nmight be granted to Lady Hester, but in the end only £1200 was awarded\r\nto her, a trifling income for one with such exalted ideas of her own\r\nimportance. A house was taken in Montagu Square, where Lady Hester\r\nentertained her half-brothers, Charles and James Stanhope, when their\r\nmilitary duties allowed of their being in town. Here she led but a\r\nmelancholy life, for her means would not allow of her keeping a\r\ncarriage, and she fancied that it was incompatible with her dignity to\r\ndrive in a hackney-coach, or to walk out attended by a servant. In\r\n1809 Charles Stanhope, like his chief, Sir John Moore, fell at\r\nCorunna. Charles was Lady Hester's favourite brother, and tradition\r\nsays that Sir John Moore was her lover. Be that as it may, she broke\r\nup her establishment in town at this time, and retired to a lonely\r\ncottage in Wales, where she amused herself in superintending her dairy\r\nand physicking the poor. But she suffered in health and spirits, the\r\ncontrast of the present with the past was too bitter to be endured in\r\nsolitude, and in 1810 she decided to go abroad, and spend a year or\r\ntwo in the south. A young medical man, Dr. Meryon, [Footnote:\r\nAfterwards Lady Hester's chronicler.] was engaged to accompany her as\r\nher travelling physician, and the party further consisted of her\r\nbrother, James Stanhope, and a friend, Mr. Nassau Sutton, together\r\nwith two or three servants. Lady Hester was only thirty when her uncle\r\ndied, but it does not seem to have been considered that she required\r\nany chaperonage, either at home or on her travels, nor does it appear\r\nthat Lord Stanhope (who lived till 1816) took any further interest in\r\nher proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, 1810, the travellers sailed for the Mediterranean on\r\nboard the frigate _Jason_. It is not necessary to follow them\r\nover the now familiar ground of the early part of their tour.\r\nGibraltar (whence Captain Stanhope left to join his regiment at\r\nCadiz), Malta, Athens, Constantinople, these were the first\r\nstopping-places, and in each Lady Hester was treated with great\r\nrespect by the authorities, and went her own way in defiance of all\r\nnative customs and prejudices. At Athens her party was joined by Lord\r\nSligo, who was making some excavations in the neighbourhood, and by\r\nLord Byron, who had just won fresh laurels by swimming the Hellespont.\r\nLady Hester formed but a poor opinion of the poet, whose affectations\r\nshe used to mimic with considerable effect. 'I think Lord Byron was a\r\nstrange character,' she said, many years later. 'His generosity was\r\nfor a motive, his avarice was for a motive; one time he was mopish,\r\nand nobody was to speak to him; another, he was for being jocular with\r\neverybody.... At Athens I saw nothing in him but a well-bred man, like\r\nmany others: for as for poetry, it is easy enough to write verses; and\r\nas for the thoughts, who knows where he got them? Many a one picks up\r\nsome old book that nobody knows anything about, and gets his ideas out\r\nof it. He had a great deal of vice in his looks--his eyes set close\r\ntogether, and a contracted brow. O Lord! I am sure he was not a\r\nliberal man, whatever else he might be. The only good thing about his\r\nlooks was this part [drawing her hand under her cheek, and down the\r\nfront of her neck], and the curl on his forehead.'\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1810 was passed at Constantinople, and the early part of\r\n1811 at the Baths of Brusa. As Lady Hester had decided to spend the\r\nfollowing winter in Egypt, a Greek vessel was hired for herself and\r\nher party, which now consisted of two gentlemen, Mr. Bruce and Mr.\r\nPearce, besides her usual retinue, and on October 23 the travellers\r\nset sail for Alexandria. After experiencing contrary winds for two or\r\nthree weeks, the ship sprang a leak, and the cry of 'All hands to the\r\npumps' showed that danger was imminent. Lady Hester took the\r\nannouncement of the misfortune with the greatest calmness, dressed\r\nherself, and ordered her maid to pack a small box with a few\r\nnecessaries. It soon became evident that the ship could not keep\r\nafloat much longer, and that the passengers and crew must take to the\r\nlong-boat if they wished to escape with their lives. They contrived,\r\nin spite of the high sea that was running, to steer their boat into a\r\nlittle creek on a rock off the island of Rhodes, and here, without\r\neither food or water, they remained for thirty hours before they were\r\nrescued, and taken ashore. Even then their state was hardly less\r\npitiable, for they were wet through, had no change of clothes, and\r\npossessed hardly enough money for their immediate necessities. Lady\r\nHester described her adventure in the following letter, dated Rhodes,\r\nDecember, 1811:--\r\n\r\n'I write one line by a ship which came in here for a few hours, just\r\nto tell you we are safe and well. Starving thirty hours on a bare\r\nrock, without even fresh water, being half naked and drenched with\r\nwet, having traversed an almost trackless country over dreadful rocks\r\nand mountains, laid me up at a village for a few days, but I have\r\nsince crossed the island on an ass, going for six hours a day, which\r\nproves I am pretty well, now, at least.... My locket, and the valuable\r\nsnuff-box Lord Sligo gave me, and two pelisses, are all I have\r\nsaved--all the travelling-equipage for Smyrna is gone; the servants\r\nnaked and unarmed; but the great loss of all is the medicine-chest,\r\nwhich saved the lives of so many travellers in Greece.'\r\n\r\nAs they had lost nearly all their clothes, and knew that it would be\r\nimpossible to procure a European refit in these regions, the\r\ntravellers decided to adopt Turkish costumes. Dr. Meryon made a\r\njourney to Smyrna, where he raised money, and bought necessary\r\narticles for the shipwrecked party at Rhodes. On his return, laden\r\nwith purchases, after an absence of five weeks, 'the packing-cases\r\nwere opened [to quote his own description], and we assumed our new\r\ndresses. Ignorant at that time of the distinctions of dress which\r\nprevail in Turkey, every one flattered himself that he was habited\r\nbecomingly. Lady Hester and Mr. Bruce little suspected, what proved to\r\nbe the case, that their exterior was that of small gentry, and Mr.\r\nPearce and myself thought we were far from looking like\r\n_Chaôoshes_ with our yatagans stuck in our girdles.' Lady Hester,\r\nit may be noted, had determined to adopt the dress of a Turkish\r\ngentleman, in order that she might travel unveiled, a proceeding that\r\nwould have been impossible in female costume.\r\n\r\nThe offer of a passage on a British frigate from Rhodes to Alexandria\r\nwas gladly accepted by Lady Hester and her friends, and on February\r\n14, 1812, they got their first glimpse of the Egyptian coast. After a\r\nfortnight spent in Alexandria, they proceeded to Cairo, where the\r\npasha, who had never seen an Englishwoman of rank before, desired the\r\nhonour of a visit from Lady Hester. In order to dazzle the eyes of her\r\nhost, she arrayed herself in a magnificent Tunisian costume of purple\r\nvelvet, elaborately embroidered in gold. For her turban and girdle she\r\nbought two cashmere shawls that cost £50 each, her pantaloons cost\r\n£40, her pelisse and waistcoat £50, her sabre £20, and her saddle £35,\r\nwhile other articles necessary for the completion of the costume cost\r\na hundred pounds more. The pasha sent five horses to convey herself\r\nand her friends to the palace, and much honour was shown her in the\r\nnumber of silver sticks that walked before her, and in the privilege\r\naccorded to her of dismounting at the inner gate. After the interview,\r\nthe pasha reviewed his troops before his distinguished visitor, and\r\npresented her with a charger, magnificently caparisoned, which she\r\nsent to England as a present to the Duke of York, her favourite among\r\nall the royal princes.\r\n\r\nThe next move was to Jaffa, where preparations were made for the\r\nregulation pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In her youth Lady Hester had been\r\ntold by Samuel Brothers, the Prophet, that she was to visit Jerusalem,\r\nto pass seven years in the desert, to become the Queen of the Jews,\r\nand to lead forth a chosen people. Now, as she journeyed towards the\r\nHoly City with her cavalcade of eleven camels and thirteen horses, she\r\nsaw the first part of the prophecy fulfilled, and laughingly avowed\r\nthat she expected to see its final accomplishment. Lady Hester had now\r\nreplaced her gorgeous Tunisian dress by a travelling Mameluke's\r\ncostume, consisting of a satin vest, a red cloth jacket shaped like a\r\nspencer, and trimmed with gold lace, and loose, full trousers of the\r\nsame cloth. Over this she wore a flowing white burnous, whose folds\r\nformed a becoming drapery to her majestic figure. In this costume she\r\nwas generally mistaken by the natives for a young Bey with his\r\nmoustaches not yet grown, but we are told that her assumption of male\r\ndress was severely criticised by the English residents in the Levant.\r\n\r\nFrom Jerusalem the party made a leisurely tour through Syria, visiting\r\nCæsarea, Acre, Nazareth, Sayda, where Lady Hester was entertained by\r\nher future enemy, the Emir Beshyr, prince of the Drûzes, and on\r\nSeptember 1, 1812, arrived at Damascus, where a lengthened stay was\r\nmade. Lady Hester had been warned that it would be dangerous for a\r\nwoman, unveiled and in man's dress, to enter Damascus, which was then\r\none of the most fanatical towns in all the Turkish dominions. But the\r\ngranddaughter of Pitt feared neither Turk nor Christian, and rode\r\nthrough the streets daily with uncovered face, and though crowds\r\nassembled to see her start, she received honours instead of the\r\nexpected insults. 'A grave yet pleasing look,' writes her chronicler,\r\n'an unembarrassed yet commanding demeanour, met the ideas of the\r\nTurks, whose manners are of this caste.... When it is considered how\r\nfanatical the people of Damascus were, and in what great abhorrence\r\nthey held infidels; that native Christians could only inhabit a\r\nparticular quarter of the town; and that no one of these could ride on\r\nhorseback within the walls, or wear as part of his dress any coloured\r\ncloth or showy turban, it will be a matter for surprise how completely\r\nthese prejudices were set aside in favour of Lady Hester, and of those\r\npersons who were with her. She rode out every day, and according to\r\nthe custom of the country, coffee was poured on the ground before her\r\nhorse to do her honour. It was said that, in going through a bazaar,\r\nall the people rose up as she passed, an honour never paid but to a\r\npasha, or to the mufti.'\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of her arrival at Damascus, Lady Hester had busied\r\nherself in arranging for a journey to the ruins of Palmyra. The\r\nexpedition was considered not only difficult but dangerous, and she\r\nwas assured that a large body of troops would be necessary to protect\r\nher from the robber tribes of the desert. While the practicability of\r\nthe enterprise was still being anxiously discussed by her Turkish\r\nadvisers, Lady Hester received a visit from a certain Nasar, son of\r\nMahannah, Emir of the Anizys [Footnote: Dr. Meryon's somewhat erratic\r\nspelling of Oriental names is followed throughout this memoir.] (the\r\ncollective name given to several of the Bedouin tribes ranging that\r\npart of the desert), who told her that he had heard of her proposed\r\nexpedition, and that he came to warn her against attempting to cross\r\nthe desert under military escort, since in that case she would be\r\ntreated as an enemy by the tribes. But, he added, if she would place\r\nherself under the protection of the Arabs, and rely upon their honour,\r\nthey would pledge themselves to conduct her from Hamah to Palmyra and\r\nback again in safety. The result of this interview was that Lady\r\nHester declined the pasha's offer of troops, and leaving the doctor to\r\nwind up affairs at Damascus she departed alone, ostensibly for Hamah,\r\na city on the highroad to Aleppo. But having secretly arranged a\r\nmeeting with the Emir Mahannah in the desert, she rode straight to his\r\ncamp, accompanied by Monsieur and Madame Lascaris, who were living in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and by a Bedouin guide. In a letter to General\r\nOakes, dated January 25, 1813, she gives the following account of her\r\nfirst experiment upon the good faith of the Arabs:--\r\n\r\n'I went with the great chief, Mahannah el Fadel (who commands 40,000\r\nmen), into the desert for a week, and marched for three days with\r\ntheir camp. I was treated with the greatest respect and hospitality,\r\nand it was the most curious sight I ever saw; horses and mares fed\r\nupon camel's milk; Arabs living upon little else except rice; the\r\nspace around me covered with living things; 1600 camels coming to\r\nwater from one tribe only; the old poets from the banks of the\r\nEuphrates singing the praises of the ancient heroes; women with lips\r\ndyed bright blue, and nails red, and hands all over flowers and\r\ndifferent designs; a chief who is obeyed like a great king; starvation\r\nand pride so mixed that really I could not have had an idea of it....\r\nHowever, I have every reason to be perfectly contented with their\r\nconduct towards me, and I am the Queen with them all.'\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the journey occupied nearly two months, the\r\ncavalcade being on a magnificent scale. Twenty-two camels were to\r\ncarry the baggage, twenty-five horsemen formed the retinue, in\r\naddition to the Bedouin escort, led by Nasar, the Emir's son. Still\r\nthe risk was great, for Lady Hester carried with her many articles of\r\nvalue, and of course was wholly at the mercy of her conductors, who\r\ngot their living by plunder. But she sought the remains of Zenobia as\r\nwell as the ruins of Palmyra, and had set her heart upon seeing the\r\ncity which had been governed by one of her own sex, and owed its chief\r\nmagnificence to her genius. Mr. Bruce, writing to General Oakes just\r\nbefore the start, observes: 'If Lady Hester succeeds in this\r\nundertaking, she will at least have the merit of being the first\r\nEuropean female who has ever visited this once celebrated city. Who\r\nknows but she may prove another Zenobia, and be destined to restore it\r\nto its ancient splendour?'\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade set out on March 20, a sum of about £50 being paid over\r\nto the Emir for his escort, with the promise of twice as much more on\r\nthe safe return of the party. The journey seems to have been\r\nuneventful save for the occasional sulks of the Bedouin leader, and\r\nthe petty thefts of his followers. The inhabitants of Palmyra had been\r\nwarned of the approach of the 'great white queen,' who rode a mare\r\nworth forty purses, and had in her possession a book which instructed\r\nher where to find treasure, and a bag of herbs with which she could\r\ntransmute stones into gold. By way of welcome a body of about two\r\nhundred men, armed with matchlocks, went out to meet her, and\r\ndisplayed for her amusement a mock attack on, and defence of, a\r\ncaravan. The guides led the cavalcade up through the long colonnade,\r\nwhich is terminated by a triumphal arch, the shaft of each of the\r\npillars having a projecting pedestal, or console, on which a statue\r\nonce stood. 'What was our surprise,' writes Dr. Meryon, 'to see, as we\r\nrode up the avenue, that several beautiful girls had been placed on\r\nthese pedestals in the most graceful postures, and with garlands in\r\ntheir hands.... On each side of the arch other girls stood by threes,\r\nwhile a row of six was arranged across the gate of the arch with\r\nthyrsi in their hands. While Lady Hester advanced, these living\r\nstatues remained immovable on their pedestals; but when she had\r\npassed, they leaped to the ground, and joined in a dance by her side.\r\nOn reaching the triumphal arch, the whole in groups, both men and\r\ngirls, danced round her. Here some bearded elders chanted verses in\r\nher praise, and all the spectators joined in the chorus. Lady Hester\r\nherself seemed to partake of the emotions to which her presence in\r\nthis remote spot had given rise. Nor was the wonder of the Palmyrenes\r\nless than our own. They beheld with amazement a woman who had ventured\r\nthousands of miles from her own country, and crossed a waste where\r\nhunger and thirst were the least of the perils to be dreaded.' It may\r\nbe observed that the people of Syria, excited by the achievements of\r\nSir Sydney Smith, had begun to imagine that their land might be\r\noccupied by the English, and perhaps regarded Lady Hester as an\r\nEnglish princess who had come to prepare the way, if not to take\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe travellers were only allowed a week in which to examine the ruins\r\nof Palmyra, being hurried away by Prince Nasar on the plea that an\r\nattack was expected from a hostile tribe. After resting for a time at\r\nHamah, and taking an affectionate farewell of their friendly Bedouins\r\n(Lady Hester was enrolled as an Anizy Arab of the tribe of Melken),\r\nthey journeyed to Laodicea, which was believed to be free from the\r\nplague that was raging in other parts of Syria, and here the summer\r\nmonths were spent. In October Mr. Bruce received letters which obliged\r\nhim to return at once to England, and, as Dr. Meryon observes, 'he\r\ntherefore reluctantly prepared to quit a lady in whose society he had\r\nso long travelled, and from whose conversation and experience of the\r\nworld so much useful knowledge was to be acquired.' Lady Hester had\r\nnow renounced the idea of returning to Europe, at any rate for the\r\npresent. She had some thoughts of taking a journey overland to\r\nBussora, and had also entered into a correspondence with the chief of\r\nthe Wahabys, with a view to travelling across the desert to visit him\r\nin his capital of Deráych; but she finally decided on remaining for\r\nsome months longer in Syria. She had heard of a house, once a\r\nmonastery, at Mar Elias, near Sayda (the ancient Sidon), which could\r\nbe hired for a small rent. The house was taken, the luggage shipped to\r\nSayda, and Lady Hester and her doctor were preparing to follow, when\r\nboth fell ill of a malignant fever, which they believed to be a\r\nspecies of plague. For some time Lady Hester's life was despaired of,\r\nbut thanks to her splendid constitution, she pulled through, though\r\nshe was not strong enough to leave Laodicea until January, 1814.\r\n\r\nLady Hester had now become a sojourner instead of a traveller in the\r\nEast, and, abandoning European customs altogether, she conformed\r\nentirely to the mode of life of the Orientals. Mar Elias, which was\r\nsituated on a spur of Mount Lebanon, in a barren and rocky region,\r\nconsisted of a one-storied stone building with flat roofs, enclosing a\r\nsmall paved court. 'Since her illness,' writes Dr. Meryon, 'Lady\r\nHester's character seemed to have changed. She became simple in her\r\nhabits, almost to cynicism. Scanning men and things with a wonderful\r\nintelligence, she commented upon them as if the motives of human\r\naction were laid open to her inspection.' The plague having again\r\nbroken out in the neighbourhood, the party at Mar Elias were insulated\r\nupon their rock, and during the early days of their tenancy were in\r\nmuch the same position as the crew of a well-victualled ship at sea,\r\nhaving abundance of fresh provisions, but no books, no newspapers, and\r\nno intercourse with the outer world.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn an expedition to the ruins of Baalbec was undertaken,\r\nand at Beyrout, on the way home, a servant brought the news that a\r\nZâym, or Capugi Bashi, [Footnote: Nominally a door-keeper, according\r\nto Dr. Meryon, but actually a Turkish official of high rank.] was at\r\nthat town on his road to Sayda, and was reported to be going to\r\ncapture Lady Hester, and carry her to Constantinople. Her ladyship\r\nreceived the announcement with her usual composure, and it turned out\r\nthat she had long expected the Capugi Bashi, and knew the object of\r\nhis visit. Scarcely had the travellers arrived at Mar Elias than a\r\nmessage came to Lady Hester, requesting her to meet the Zâym at the\r\nhouse of the governor of Sayda, since it was not customary for a\r\nTurkish official to go to a Christian's house. But in this case the\r\nhaughty Moslem had reckoned without his host. Lady Hester returned so\r\nspirited an answer that the Zâym at once ordered his horses, and\r\ngalloped over to Mar Elias. The doctor and the secretary, knowing\r\nnothing of the mission, felt considerable doubt of his intentions, and\r\nput loaded pistols in their girdles, determined that if he had a\r\nbowstring under his robes, no use should be made of it while they had\r\na bullet at his disposal. In the Turkish dominions, it must be\r\nunderstood, a Capugi Bashi seldom comes into the provinces unless for\r\nsome affair of strangling, beheading, confiscation, or imprisonment,\r\nand his presence is the more dreaded, as it is never known on whose\r\nhead the blow will fall.\r\n\r\nIn this case, fortunately, the Capugi's visit had no sinister motive.\r\nThe fact was now divulged that Lady Hester had been given a\r\nmanuscript, said to have been copied by a monk from the records of a\r\nFrank monastery in Syria, which disclosed the hiding-places of immense\r\nhoards of money buried in certain specified spots in the cities of\r\nAscalon and Sayda. Lady Hester, having convinced herself of the\r\ngenuineness of the manuscript, had written to the Sultan through Mr.,\r\nafterwards Sir Robert, Liston, for permission to make the necessary\r\nexcavations, at the same time offering to forego all pecuniary benefit\r\nthat might accrue from her labours. The custom of burying money in\r\ntimes of danger is so common in the East that credence was easily lent\r\nto the story, while the fact that treasure might lie for centuries\r\nuntouched, even though the secret of its existence was known to\r\nseveral persons, was possible in a country where digging among ruins\r\nalways excites dangerous suspicions in the minds of the authorities,\r\nand where the discovery of a jar of coins almost invariably leads to\r\nthe ruin of the finder, who is supposed to keep back more than he\r\nreveals.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan evidently believed that the matter was worth examination,\r\nfor he had sent the Capugi from Constantinople to invest Lady Hester\r\nwith greater authority over the Turks than had ever been granted even\r\nto a European ambassador. It was arranged that the first excavations\r\nshould be made at Ascalon, and though Lady Hester, having only just\r\nreturned from Baalbec, felt disinclined to set out at once on another\r\nlong journey, the Zâym urged her to lose no time, and himself went on\r\nto Acre to make the necessary preparations. As her income barely\r\nsufficed for her own expenditure, she resolved to ask the English\r\nGovernment to pay the cost of her search, holding that the honour\r\nwhich would thereby accrue to the English name was a sufficient\r\njustification for her demand.\r\n\r\n'I shall beg of you,' she said to Dr. Meryon, 'to keep a regular\r\naccount of every article, and will then send in my bill to Government\r\nby Mr. Liston; when, if they refuse to pay me, I shall put it in the\r\nnewspapers, and expose them. And this I shall let them know very\r\nplainly, as I consider it my right, and not as a favour; for if Sir A.\r\nPaget put down the cost of his servants' liveries after his embassy to\r\nVienna, and made Mr. Pitt pay him, £70,000 for four years, I cannot\r\nsee why I should not do the same.'\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1815, Lady Hester left Mar Elias on horseback,\r\nfollowed by her usual retinue, and on arriving at Acre spent about\r\nthree weeks in preparing for the work at Ascalon. In compliance with\r\nthe firmans sent by the Porte to all the governors of Syria, she was\r\ntreated with distinctions usually paid to no one under princely rank.\r\n'Whenever she went out,' writes Dr. Meryon, 'she was followed by a\r\ncrowd of spectators; and the curiosity and admiration which she had\r\nvery generally excited throughout Syria were now increased by her\r\nsupposed influence in the affairs of Government, in having a Capugi\r\nBashi at her command.... No Turk now paid her a visit without wearing\r\nhis mantle of ceremony, and every circumstance showed the ascendency\r\nshe had gained in public opinion.' In addition to her own six tents,\r\ntwenty more were furnished for her suite, besides twenty-two\r\ntent-pitchers, twelve mules to carry the baggage, and twelve camels to\r\ncarry the tents. To Lady Hester's use was appropriated a gorgeous\r\ntilted palanquin or litter, covered with crimson cloth, and ornamented\r\nwith gilded balls. In case she preferred riding, her mare and her\r\nfavourite black ass were led in front of the litter. A hundred men of\r\nthe Hawàry cavalry escorted the procession, which left Acre on March\r\n18, and arrived at Jaffa ten days later. Here a short halt was made,\r\nand on the last day of March they set off for Ascalon, their animals\r\nladen with shovels, pickaxes, and baskets. On arriving at their\r\ndestination the tents were pitched in the midst of the ruins, while a\r\ncottage was fitted up for Lady Hester without the walls. Orders were\r\nat once despatched to the neighbouring villages for relays of\r\nlabourers to work at the excavations. These men received no pay, being\r\nrequisitioned by Government, but they were well fed and humanely\r\ntreated by their English employer. The excavations were carried on for\r\nabout a fortnight on the site indicated in the mysterious paper.\r\nDuring the first three days nothing was found except bones, fragments\r\nof pillars, and a few vases and bottles; but on the fourth day a fine,\r\nthough mutilated, colossal statue was discovered, which apparently\r\nrepresented a deified king. Dr. Meryon made a sketch of the marble,\r\nand pointed out to Lady Hester that her labours had at least brought\r\nto light a treasure that would be valuable in the eyes of lovers of\r\nart, and that the ruins would be memorable for the enterprise of a\r\nwoman who had rescued the remains of antiquity from oblivion. To his\r\nastonishment and dismay she replied, 'It is my intention to break up\r\nthe statue, and have it thrown into the sea, precisely in order that\r\nsuch a report may not get abroad, and I lose with the Porte all the\r\nmerit of my disinterestedness.' In vain Dr. Meryon represented that\r\nsuch an act would be an unpardonable vandalism, and was the less\r\nexcusable since the Turks had neither claimed the statue, nor\r\nprotested against its preservation. Her only answer was: 'Malicious\r\npeople may say I came to search for antiquities for my country, and\r\nnot for treasures for the Porte. So, go this instant, take with you\r\nhalf-a-dozen stout fellows, and break it into a thousand pieces.'\r\nMichaud, in his account of the affair, says that the Turks clamoured\r\nfor the destruction of the statue, believing that the trunk was full\r\nof gold, and that Lady Hester had it broken up in order to prove to\r\nthem their error. Be this as it may, reports were afterwards\r\ncirculated in Ascalon that the statue had actually contained treasure,\r\nhalf of which was handed over to the Porte, and half kept by Lady\r\nHester.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day two large stone troughs were discovered, upon which\r\nlay four granite pillars. This sight revived the hopes of the\r\nsearchers, for it was thought that the mass of granite could not have\r\nfallen into such a position accidentally, but must have been placed\r\nthere to conceal something of value. Great was the disappointment of\r\nall concerned when, on removing the pillars, the troughs were found to\r\nbe empty. The excavations of the next four days having produced\r\nnothing of any value, the work was brought to an end, by Lady Hester's\r\ndesire, on April 14. She had come to the conclusion that when Gezzar\r\nPasha embellished the city of Acre by digging for marble among the\r\nruins of Ascalon, he had been fortunate enough to discover the\r\ntreasure, and she believed that his apparent mania for building was\r\nonly a cloak to conceal his real motives for excavating. The officials\r\nand soldiers were handsomely rewarded for their trouble, and Lady\r\nHester set out on her homeward journey, minus her tents, palanquin,\r\nmilitary escort, and other emblems of grandeur, but with no loss of\r\ndignity or serenity.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Mar Elias, she caused some excavations to be made near\r\nSayda, but with no better success, and after a few days the work was\r\nabandoned. Lady Hester had been obliged to borrow a sum of money for\r\nher expenses from Mr. Barker, the British consul at Aleppo, and now,\r\nobserves Dr. Meryon, 'as she had throughout proposed to herself no\r\nadvantage but the celebrity which success would bring on her own name\r\nand that of the English nation, and as she had acted with the\r\ncognisance of our minister at Constantinople, she fancied that she had\r\na claim upon the English Government for her expenses. Accordingly, she\r\nsent our ambassador an account of her proceedings, and after showing\r\nthat all she had done was for the credit of her country, she asserted\r\nher right to be reimbursed. She was unsuccessful, however, in her\r\napplication, and the expenses weighed heavily upon her means. Yet\r\nhitherto she had never been in debt, and by great care and economy she\r\nstill contrived to keep out of it.'\r\n\r\nLady Hester having apparently decided to spend the remainder of her\r\ndays in Syria, Dr. Meryon informed her that he was anxious to return\r\nto his own country, but that he would not leave her until a substitute\r\nhad been engaged. Accordingly, Giorgio, the Greek interpreter, was\r\ndespatched to England to engage the doctor's successor, and to execute\r\na number of commissions for his mistress. During the autumn Lady\r\nHester was actively employed in stirring up the authorities to avenge\r\nthe death of a French traveller, Colonel Boutin, who had been murdered\r\nby the Ansarys on the road between Hamah and Laodicea. As the pasha of\r\nthe district had made no effort to trace or punish the murderers, she\r\nhad taken the matter into her own hands, holding that the common cause\r\nof travellers demanded that such a crime should not go unpunished. Dr.\r\nMeryon vainly tried to dissuade her from this course of action, urging\r\nthat the French consuls were bound to sift the affair, and that she,\r\nin taking so active a part, was exposing herself to the vengeance of\r\nthe mountain tribes. As usual, the only effect of remonstrance was to\r\nmake her more determined to persevere in the course she had marked out\r\nfor herself. In the result, she succeeded in inducing the pasha to\r\nsend a punitive expedition into the mountains, and herself directed\r\nthe commandant, by information secretly obtained, where the criminals\r\nwere to be found. Mustafa Aga Berber, governor of the district, led\r\nthe expedition, and carried fire and sword into the Ansary country. It\r\nwas reported that he burnt the villages of the assassins, and sent\r\nseveral heads to the pasha as tokens of his victories. Lady Hester\r\nreceived a vote of thanks from the French Chamber of Deputies, after a\r\nspeech by Comte Delaborde, explaining the services she had rendered.\r\n\r\nNews of the great events that were taking place in France had now\r\nreached Sayda, and Lady Hester, whose foible it was to think that the\r\nsuccessors of Pitt could do no right, was highly displeased at the\r\naction of the British Government. She gave vent to her sentiments in\r\nthe following letter, dated April 1816, to her cousin the Marquis\r\n(afterwards Duke) of Buckingham:--\r\n\r\n'You cannot doubt that a woman of my character and (I presume to say)\r\nunderstanding must have held in contempt and aversion all the\r\nstatesmen of the present day, whose unbounded ignorance and duplicity\r\nhave brought ruin on France, have spread their own shame through all\r\nEurope, and have exposed themselves not only to ridicule, but to the\r\ncurses of present and future generations. One great mind, one single,\r\nenlightened statesman, whose virtues had equalled his talents, was all\r\nthat was wanting to effect, at this unexampled period, the welfare of\r\nall Europe, by taking advantage of events the most extraordinary that\r\nhave occurred in any era.... Cease therefore to torment me. I will not\r\nlive in Europe, even were I, in flying from it, compelled to beg my\r\nbread. Once only will I go to France, to see you and James, but only\r\nthat once. I will not be a martyr for nothing. The granddaughter of\r\nChatham, the niece of the illustrious Pitt, feels herself blush that\r\nshe was born in England--that England who has made her accursed gold\r\nthe counterpoise to justice; that England who puts weeping humanity in\r\nirons, who has employed the valour of her troops, destined for the\r\ndefence of her national honour, as the instrument to enslave a\r\nfreeborn people; and who has exposed to ridicule and humiliation a\r\nmonarch [Louis XVIII.] who might have gained the goodwill of his\r\nsubjects if those intriguing English had left him to stand or fall\r\nupon his own merits.'\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the arrival of the Princess of Wales at Acre, and\r\nthe possibility that she might extend her journey to Sayda, induced\r\nLady Hester to embark for Antioch, where she professed to have\r\nbusiness with the British consul. It was considered an act of great\r\ndaring on her part to go into a district inhabited entirely by the\r\nAnsárys, on whom she had lately wrought so signal a vengeance. But the\r\nAnsárys had apparently no desire to bring upon themselves a second\r\npunitive expedition, and though Lady Hester spent most of her time in\r\na retired cottage outside the town, in defiance of the warning that\r\nher life was in danger, the tribes forbore to molest her. In September\r\nshe returned to Mar Elias; and, a few weeks later, Giorgio returned\r\nfrom England, bringing with him an English surgeon and twenty-seven\r\npacking-cases filled with presents, to be distributed among Lady\r\nHester's Turkish friends and acquaintances. On January 18, 1817, Dr.\r\nMeryon, having initiated his successor into Eastern manners and\r\ncustoms, took leave of his employer, and sailed for Europe, little\r\nthinking that he would ever set foot in Syria again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next ten or twelve years, we get but a few scanty glimpses\r\nof the white Queen of the Desert. After Dr. Meryon's departure, Lady\r\nHester removed to a house in the village of Dar Jôon, or Djoun, a few\r\nmiles from Mar Elias. To this house she added considerably, laid out\r\nsome magnificent gardens, and enclosed the whole within high walls,\r\nafter the manner of a mediaeval fortress. Here she seems to have\r\npassed her time in encouraging the Drûzes to rise against Ibrahim\r\nPasha, intriguing against the British consuls, and attempting to\r\nbolster up the declining authority of the Sultan. In the intervals of\r\npolitical business she occupied herself with superintending her\r\nbuilding and gardening operations, physicking the sick, and\r\ntyrannising over her numerous servants. At Mar Elias, which she still\r\nkept in her own hands, she maintained an eccentric old Frenchman,\r\nGeneral Loustaunau,[Footnote: Dr. Meryon's spelling.] who had formerly\r\nbeen in the service of a Hindu rajah, but who, in his forlorn old age,\r\nhad wandered to Syria, and there, by dint of applying scriptural texts\r\nto contemporary events, had earned the title of a prophet. Like Samuel\r\nBrothers, he prophesied marvellous things of Lady Hester's future,\r\nwhich she, rendered credulous by her solitary life in a mystic land,\r\nwhere her own power and importance were the chief facts in her mental\r\nhorizon, came at length to believe.\r\n\r\nIn the _Memoirs of a Babylonian Princess_ by the Emira Asmar,\r\ndaughter of the Emir Abdallah Asmar, the author tells us that as a\r\ngirl she paid a long visit to the Emir Beshyr, prince of the Drûzes.\r\nDuring this visit, which apparently took place in the early\r\n'twenties,' she was sent with a present of fruit to a neighbour's\r\nhouse, and there found a guest, a tall and splendid figure, arrayed in\r\nmasculine costume, and engaged in smoking a narghila. The stranger,\r\nwho talked Arabic with elegance and fluency, discoursed on the subject\r\nof astrology, and tried to dissuade the Emira from taking a projected\r\njourney to the west, where she declared the sun had set, and the\r\nhearts of the people retained not a spark of the virtues of their\r\nforefathers. 'Soon afterwards,' continues the author, 'she rose, and\r\ntook her departure, attended by a large retinue. A spirited charger\r\nstood at the gate, champing the bit with fiery impatience. She put her\r\nfoot in the stirrup, and vaulting nimbly into the saddle, which she\r\nbestrode like a man, started off at a rapid pace, galloping over rocks\r\nand mountains in advance of her suite, with a fearlessness and address\r\nthat would have done honour to a Mameluke.' The stranger was, of\r\ncourse, none other than Lady Hester Stanhope, who, at that time, was\r\non friendly terms with the Emir Beshyr, afterwards her bitterest\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Lady Hester wrote to invite Dr. Meryon to return to her\r\nservice for a time, and he, who seems all his life to have 'heard the\r\nEast a-calling,' could not resist the invitation, though his movements\r\nwere now hampered by a wife and children. He began at once to make\r\npreparations for his departure, but was unable to start before\r\nSeptember 1827. Meanwhile, Lady Hester had been gulled by an English\r\ntraveller, designated as 'X.' in her letters, who had induced her to\r\nbelieve that he was empowered by the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of\r\nBedford, and a committee of Freemasons, to offer her such sums as\r\nwould extricate her out of her embarrassments, and to settle an income\r\nupon her for life. How a woman who professed to have an almost\r\nsupernatural insight into the characters and thoughts of men, could\r\nhave been deceived by this story, it is hard to understand; but\r\napparently the difficulties of her situation, occasioned by her custom\r\nof making large presents to the pashas in order to keep up her\r\nauthority, as well as by her benevolence to the poor in her\r\nneighbourhood, rendered her willing to catch at any straw for help.\r\nThis 'X' had promised to send her a hundred purses for her current\r\nexpenses, and to bring out from England masons and carpenters to\r\nenlarge her dwelling, in order that she might entertain the many\r\ndistinguished people who desired to come and see her. In a letter to\r\nDr. Meryon on this subject, Lady Hester writes:--\r\n\r\n'If X.'s story is true, and my debts, amounting to nearly 10,000\r\npounds, are to be paid, then I shall go on making sublime and\r\nphilosophical discoveries, and employing myself in deep, abstract\r\nstudies. In that case I shall want a mason, carpenter, etc., income\r\nmade out 4000 pounds a year, and 1000 pounds more for people like you,\r\nand 500 pounds ready money that I may stand clear. In the event that\r\nall that has been told me is a lie.... I shall give up everything for\r\nlife to my creditors, and throw myself as a beggar on Asiatic charity,\r\nand wander far without one parra in my pocket, with the mare from the\r\nstable of Solomon in one hand, and a sheaf of the corn of Beni-Israel\r\nin the other. I shall meet death, or that which I believe to be\r\nwritten, which no mortal can efface. On September 7, Dr. Meryon and\r\nhis family embarked at Leghorn for Cyprus, but on nearing Candia their\r\nmerchant brig, which was taking out stores to the Turks, was attacked\r\nby a Greek vessel, whose officers took possession of the cargo, and\r\nalso of all the passengers' property, except that belonging to the\r\nEnglish party, which they left unmolested. The Italian captain was\r\nobliged to put back to Leghorn, and here Dr. Meryon heard the news of\r\nthe battle of Navarino, and of the shelter afforded by Lady Hester\r\nStanhope to two hundred refugee Europeans from Sayda. By this time she\r\nwas at daggers-drawn with the Emir Beshyr, whose rival she had helped\r\nand protected. The Emir revenged himself by publishing in the village\r\nan order that all her native servants were to return to their homes,\r\nupon pain of losing their property and their lives. 'I gave them all\r\ntheir option,' she writes. 'And most of them remained firm. Since\r\nthat, he has threatened to seize and murder them here, which he shall\r\nnot do without taking my life too. Besides this, he has given orders\r\nin all the villages that men, women, and children who render me the\r\nsmallest service shall be cut in a thousand pieces. My servants cannot\r\ngo out, and the peasants cannot approach the house. Therefore, I am in\r\nno very pleasant situation, being deprived of the necessary supplies\r\nof food, and what is worse, of water; for all the water here is\r\nbrought on mules' backs up a great steep.'\r\n\r\nDr. Meryon was unable to resume his voyage at this time, but in 1828,\r\nthe news that a malignant fever had attacked the household at Jôon,\r\nand carried off Lady Hester's companion, Miss Williams, gave rise to\r\nfresh plans for a visit to Syria. The doctor had, however, so much\r\ndifficulty in overcoming his wife's fears of the voyage, that it was\r\nnot until November, 1830, that he could induce her to embark at\r\nMarseilles on a vessel bound for the East. The party arrived at\r\nBeyrout on December 8, and found that Lady Hester had sent camels and\r\nasses to bring them on their way, together with a characteristic note\r\nto the effect that it would give her much pleasure to see the doctor,\r\nbut that, as for his family, they must not expect any other attentions\r\nthan such as would make them comfortable in their new home. She hoped\r\nthat Dr. Meryon would not take this ill, as she had warned him that\r\nshe did not think English ladies could make themselves happy in Syria,\r\nand, therefore, he who had chosen to bring them must take the\r\nconsequences. This letter was but the first of a long series of\r\naffronts put upon Mrs. Meryon, the result of Lady Hester's dislike of\r\nher own sex, and probably also of her objection to the presence of\r\nanother Englishwoman in a spot where she had reigned so long as the\r\nonly specimen of her race.\r\n\r\nA cottage had been provided in the village of Jôon for the travellers,\r\nand the ladies were escorted thither by the French secretary, while\r\nthe doctor hastened to report himself to Lady Hester, who received him\r\nwith the greatest cordiality, kissing him on both cheeks, and placing\r\nhim beside her on the sofa. Remembering her overweening pride of\r\nbirth, he was astonished at his reception, more especially as, in the\r\nearly part of her travels, she had never even condescended to take his\r\narm, that honour being reserved exclusively for members of the\r\naristocracy. He found her ladyship in good health and spirits, but\r\nbarely provided with the necessaries of life, having been robbed of\r\nnearly all her articles of value by the native servants during her\r\nlast illness. A rush-bottomed chair, a deal table, dishes of common\r\nyellow earthenware, bone-handled knives and forks, and two or three\r\nsilver spoons, were all that remained of her former grandeur, and the\r\ndinner was on a par with the furniture.\r\n\r\nThe house, which had been hired at a rental of £20 from a Turkish\r\nmerchant, had been greatly enlarged, and the gardens, with their\r\nsummer-houses, covered alleys, and serpentine walks, were superior to\r\nmost English gardens of the same size. Lady Hester's constant outlay\r\nin building arose from her idea that people would fly to her for\r\nsuccour and protection during the revolutions that she believed to be\r\nimpending all over the world; her camels, asses, and mules were kept\r\nwith the same view, and her servants were taught to look forward with\r\nawe to events of a supernatural nature, when their services and\r\nenergies would be taxed to the utmost. In choosing a solitary life in\r\nthe wilderness, far removed from all the comforts and pleasures of\r\ncivilisation, Lady Hester seems to have been actuated by her craving\r\nfor absolute power, which could not be gratified in any European\r\ncommunity. It was her pleasure to dwell apart, surrounded by\r\ndependants and slaves, and out of reach of that influence and\r\nrestraint which are necessarily endured by each member of a civilised\r\nsociety. She had become more violent in her temper than formerly, and\r\ntreated her servants with great severity when they were negligent of\r\ntheir duties. Her maids and female slaves she punished summarily, and\r\nboasted that there was nobody who could give such a slap in the face,\r\nwhen required, as she could. At Mar Elias her servants, when tired of\r\nher tyranny, frequently absconded by night, and took refuge in Sayda,\r\nonly two miles away; but at Dar Joon their retreat was cut off by\r\nmountain tracts, inhabited only by wolves and jackals, and they were\r\nconsequently almost helpless in the hands of their stern mistress. The\r\nestablishment at this time consisted of between thirty and forty\r\nservants, labourers, and slaves, most of whom are described as dirty,\r\nlazy, and dishonest. Between them they did badly the work that\r\nhalf-a-dozen Europeans would have done respectably, but then the\r\nEuropeans would not have stood the slaps and scoldings that the\r\nnatives took as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nFor the last fifteen years Lady Hester had seldom left her bed till\r\nbetween two and five o'clock in the afternoon, nor returned to it\r\nbefore the same hour next morning; while for four years she had never\r\nstirred beyond the precincts of her own domain, though she took some\r\nair and exercise in the garden. Except when she was asleep, her bell\r\nwas incessantly ringing, her servants were running to and fro, and the\r\nwhole house was kept in commotion. During the greater part of the day\r\nshe sat up in bed, writing, talking, scolding, and interviewing her\r\nwork-people. Few of her _employés_ escaped from her presence\r\nwithout reproof, and as no one was allowed to exercise his own\r\ndiscretion in his work, her directing spirit was always in the full\r\nflow of activity. 'On one and the same day,' says Dr. Meryon,' I have\r\nknown her to dictate papers that concerned the political welfare of a\r\npashalik, and descend to trivial details about the composition of a\r\nhouse-paint, the making of butter, drenching a sick horse, choosing\r\nlambs, or cutting out a maid's apron. The marked characteristic of her\r\nmind was the necessity that she laboured under of incessantly\r\ntalking.' Her conversations, we are told, frequently lasted for seven\r\nor eight hours at a stretch, and at least one of her visitors was kept\r\nso long in discourse that he fainted away with fatigue. Dr. Meryon\r\nbears witness to her marvellous colloquial powers, her fund of\r\nanecdote, and her talent for mimicry, but observes that every one who\r\nconversed with her retired humbled from her presence, since her\r\nlanguage was always calculated to bring men down to their proper\r\nlevel, to strip off affectation, and to expose conceit.\r\n\r\nAt this time her political influence was on the wane, but a few years\r\npreviously, when her financial affairs were in a more flourishing\r\ncondition, and when it was observed that the pashas valued her opinion\r\nand feared her censure, she had obtained an almost despotic power over\r\nthe neighbouring tribes. A remarkable proof of her personal courage,\r\nand also of the supernatural awe with which she was regarded, was\r\nshown by her open defiance of the Emir Beshyr, in whose principality\r\nshe lived, but who was unable to reduce her, either by threats or\r\npersecution, to even a nominal submission to his rule. Not only did\r\nshe give public utterance to her contemptuous opinion of the Emir, but\r\nshe openly assisted his relation and rival, the Sheikh Beshyr; yet no\r\nvengeance either of the bowstring or the poisoned cup rewarded her\r\nrebellion or her intrigues.\r\n\r\nHer religious views, at this time, were decidedly complicated in\r\ncharacter. She firmly believed in astrology, of which she had made a\r\nspecial study, and to some extent in demonology. But more remarkable\r\nwas her faith in the early coming of a Messiah, or Mahedi, on which\r\noccasion she expected to play a glorious part. The prophecies of\r\nSamuel Brothers and of General Loustaunau had taken firm possession of\r\nher mind, more especially since their words had been corroborated by a\r\nnative soothsayer, Metta by name, who brought her an Arabic book\r\nwhich, he said, contained allusions to herself. Finding a credulous\r\nlistener, he read and expounded a passage relating to a European woman\r\nwho was to come and live on Mount Lebanon at a certain epoch, and\r\nobtain power and influence greater than a sultan's. A boy without a\r\nfather was to join her there, whose destiny was to be fulfilled under\r\nher wing; while the coming of the Mahedi, who was to ride into\r\nJerusalem on a horse born saddled, would be preceded by famine,\r\npestilence, and other calamities. For a long time Lady Hester was\r\npersuaded that the Due de Reichstadt was the boy in question, but\r\nafter his death she fixed upon another youth. In expectation of the\r\ncoming of the Mahedi she kept two thoroughbred mares, which no one was\r\nsuffered to mount. One of these animals, named Laila, had a curious\r\nmalformation of the back, not unlike a Turkish saddle in shape, and\r\nwas destined by its mistress to bear the Mahedi into Jerusalem, while\r\non the other, Lulu, Lady Hester expected to ride by his side on the\r\ngreat day. 'Hundreds and thousands of distressed persons,' she was\r\naccustomed to say, 'will come to me for assistance and shelter. I\r\nshall have to wade in blood, but it is the will of God, and I shall\r\nnot be afraid.' Borne up by these glorious expectations, she never\r\ndiscussed her debts, her illnesses, and her other trials, without at\r\nthe same time picturing to herself a brighter future, when the neglect\r\nwith which she had been treated by her family would meet with its just\r\npunishment, and her star would rise again to gladden the world, and\r\nmore especially those who had been faithful to her in the time of\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mrs. Meryon was settled in her new home, and had recovered\r\nfrom the fatigue of the journey, Lady Hester appointed a day for her\r\nreception. What happened at the momentous interview we are not told,\r\nexcept that at the close Lady Hester attired her visitor in a handsome\r\nTurkish spencer of gold brocade, and wound an embroidered muslin\r\nturban round her head. Unfortunately, Mrs. Meryon, not understanding\r\nthe Eastern custom of robing honoured guests, took off the garments\r\nbefore she went away, and laid them on a table, a grievous breach of\r\netiquette in her hostess's eyes. Still, matters went on fairly\r\nsmoothly until, about the end of January, a messenger came from\r\nDamascus to ask that Dr. Meryon might be allowed to go thither to cure\r\na friend of the pasha's, who had an affection of the mouth. Lady\r\nHester was anxious that the doctor should obey the call, but, greatly\r\nto her annoyance, he entirely declined to leave his wife and children\r\nalone for three or four weeks in a strange land, where they could not\r\nmake themselves understood by the people about them. In vain Lady\r\nHester tried to frighten Mrs. Meryon into consenting to her husband's\r\ndeparture by assuring her that there were Dervishes who could inflict\r\nall sorts of evil on her by means of charms, if she persisted in her\r\nrefusal. Mrs. Meryon quietly replied that her husband could go if he\r\nchose, but that it would not be with her goodwill. From that hour was\r\nbegun a system of hostility towards the doctor's wife, which never\r\nceased until her departure from the country.\r\n\r\nLady Hester was not above taking a leaf out of the book of her own\r\nenemy, the Emir Beshyr, for she used her influence to prevent the\r\nvillagers from supplying the wants of the recalcitrant family, who now\r\nbegan to make preparations for their departure. They were obliged,\r\nhowever, to wait for remittances from England, and also for Lady\r\nHester's consent to their leaving Jôon, since none of the natives\r\nwould have dared lend their camels or mules for such a purpose, and\r\neven the consular agents at Sayda would have declined to mix\r\nthemselves up in any business which might bring upon them the\r\nvengeance of the Queen of the Desert. Meanwhile, a truce seems to have\r\nbeen concluded between the principals, and Lady Hester again invited\r\nthe doctor's visits, contenting herself with sarcastic remarks about\r\nhenpecked husbands, and the caprices of foolish women. She graciously\r\nconsented to dispense with his services about the beginning of April,\r\nand promised to engage a vessel at Sayda to convey him and his family\r\nto Cyprus. Before his departure she produced a list of her debts,\r\nwhich then amounted to £14,000. The greater part of this sum, which\r\nhad been borrowed at a high rate of interest from native usurers, had\r\nbeen spent in assisting Abdallah Pasha, the family of the Sheikh\r\nBeshyr, and many other victims of political malignity.\r\n\r\nThe unwonted luxury of an admiring and submissive listener led the\r\nlonely woman to discourse of the glories of her youth, and the virtues\r\nof her hero-in-chief, William Pitt. She spoke of his passion for Miss\r\nEden, daughter of Lord Auckland, who, she said, was the only woman she\r\ncould have wished him to marry. 'Poor Mr. Pitt almost broke his heart,\r\nwhen he gave her up,' she declared. 'But he considered that she was\r\nnot a woman to be left at will when business might require it, and he\r\nsacrificed his feelings to his sense of public duty.... \"There were\r\nalso other reasons,\" Mr. Pitt would say; \"there is her mother, such a\r\nchatterer!--and then the family intrigues. I can't keep them out of my\r\nhouse; and, for my king and country's sake, I must remain a free man.\"\r\nYet Mr. Pitt was a man just made for domestic life, who would have\r\nenjoyed retirement, digging his own garden, and doing it cleverly\r\ntoo.... He had so much urbanity too! I recollect returning late from a\r\nball, when he was gone to bed fatigued; there were others besides\r\nmyself, and we made a good deal of noise. I said to him next morning,\r\n\"I am afraid we disturbed you last night.\" \"Not at all,\" he replied;\r\n\"I was dreaming of the masque of _Comus_, and when I heard you\r\nall so gay, it seemed a pleasant reality....\" Nobody would have\r\nsuspected how much feeling he had for people's comforts, who came to\r\nsee him. Sometimes he would say to me, \"Hester, you know we have got\r\nsuch a one coming down. I believe his wound is hardly well yet, and I\r\nheard him say that he felt much relieved by fomentations of such an\r\nherb; perhaps you will see that he finds in his chamber all that he\r\nwants.\" Of another he would say, \"I think he drinks asses' milk; I\r\nshould like him to have his morning draught.\" And I, who was born with\r\nsuch sensibility that I must fidget myself about everybody, was sure\r\nto exceed his wishes.'\r\n\r\nAfter describing Mr. Pitt's kindness and consideration towards his\r\nhousehold, Lady Hester related a pathetic history of a faithful\r\nservant, who, in the pecuniary distress of his master, had served him\r\nfor several years with the purest disinterestedness. 'I was so touched\r\nby her eloquent and forcible manner of recounting the story,' writes\r\nthe soft-hearted doctor, 'and with the application I made of it to my\r\nown tardiness in going to her in her distress, together with my\r\npresent intention of leaving her, that I burst into tears, and wept\r\nbitterly. She soothed my feelings, endeavoured to calm my emotions,\r\nand disclaimed all intention of conveying any allusion to me. This led\r\nher to say how little malice she ever entertained towards any one,\r\neven those who had done her injury, much less towards me, who had\r\nalways shown my attachment to her; and she added that, even now,\r\nalthough she was going to lose me, her thoughts did not run so much on\r\nher own situation as on what would become of me; and I firmly believed\r\nher.'\r\n\r\nDr. Meryon sailed from Sayda on April 7, 1831, and for the next six\r\nyears we only hear of the strange household on Mount Lebanon through\r\nthe reports of chance visitors. After the siege of Acre by Ibrahim\r\nPasha in the winter of 1831-32, the remnant of the population fled to\r\nthe mountains, and Lady Hester, whose hospitality was always open to\r\nthe distressed, declares that for three years her house was like the\r\nTower of Babel. In 1832 Lamartine paid a visit to Jôon, which he has\r\ndescribed in his _Voyage en Orient_. He seems to have been\r\ngraciously received, though his hostess candidly informed him that she\r\nhad never heard his name before. He explained, rather to her\r\namusement, that he had written verses which were in the mouths of\r\nthousands of his countrymen, and she having read his character and\r\ndestiny, assured him that his Arabian descent was proved by the high\r\narch of his instep, and that, like every Arab, he was a poet by\r\nnature. Lamartine, in return, represents himself as profoundly\r\nimpressed by his interview with this 'Circe of the East,' denies that\r\nhe perceived in her any traces of insanity, and declares that he\r\nshould not be surprised if a part of the destiny she prophesied for\r\nherself were realised--at least to the extent of an empire in Arabia,\r\nor a throne in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nLady Hester formed a less favourable opinion of M. Lamartine than she\r\nallowed him to perceive, and she was greatly annoyed at the passages\r\nreferring to herself that appeared in his book. Speaking of him and\r\nhis visit some years later, she observed: 'The people of Europe are\r\nall, or at least the greater part of them, fools, with their\r\nridiculous grins, their affected ways, and their senseless habits....\r\nLook at M. Lamartine getting off his horse half-a-dozen times to kiss\r\nhis dog, and take him out of his bandbox to feed him, on the route\r\nfrom Beyrout; the very muleteers thought him a fool. And then that way\r\nof thrusting his hands into his pockets, and sticking out his legs as\r\nfar as he could--what is that like? M. Lamartine is no poet, in my\r\nestimation, though he may be an elegant versifier; he has no sublime\r\nideas. Compare his ideas with Shakespeare's--that was indeed a real\r\npoet.... M. Lamartine, with his straight body and straight fingers,\r\npointed his toes in my face, and then turned to his dog, and held long\r\nconversations with him. He thought to make a great effect when he was\r\nhere, but he was grievously mistaken.' It may be noted that all Lady\r\nHester's male visitors 'pointed their toes in her face,' in the hope\r\nof being accredited with the arched instep that she held to be the\r\nmost striking proof of long descent. Her own instep, she was\r\naccustomed to boast, was so high that a little kitten could run\r\nunderneath it.\r\n\r\nA far more lifelike and picturesque portrait of Lady Hester than that\r\nby Lamartine has been sketched for us by Kinglake in his\r\n_Eothen_. In a charming passage which will be familiar to most\r\nreaders, he relates how the name of Lady Hester Stanhope was as\r\ndelightful to his childish ears as that of Robinson Crusoe. Chief\r\namong the excitements of his early days were the letters and presents\r\nof the Queen of the Desert, who as a girl had been much with her\r\ngrandmother, Lady Chatham, at Burton Pynsent, and there had made the\r\nacquaintance of Miss Woodforde of Taunton, afterwards Mrs. Kinglake.\r\nThe tradition of her high spirit and fine horsemanship still lingered\r\nin Somersetshire memories, but Kinglake had heard nothing of her for\r\nmany years, when, on arriving at Beyrout in 1835, he found that her\r\nname was in every mouth. Anxious to see this romantic vision of his\r\nchildhood, he wrote to Lady Hester, and asked if she would receive his\r\nmother's son. A few days later, in response to a gracious letter of\r\ninvitation, Kinglake made his pilgrimage to Jôon.\r\n\r\nThe house at this time, after the storm and stress of the Egyptian\r\ninvasion, had the appearance of a deserted fortress, and\r\nfierce-looking Albanian soldiers were hanging about the gates.\r\nKinglake was conducted to an inner apartment where, in the dim light,\r\nhe perceived an Oriental figure, clad in masculine costume, which\r\nadvanced to meet him with many and profound bows. The visitor began a\r\npolite speech which he had prepared for his hostess, but presently\r\ndiscovered that the stranger was only her Italian attendant, Lunardi,\r\nwho had conferred on himself a medical title and degree. Lady Hester\r\nhad given orders that her guest should rest and dine before being\r\nintroduced to her, and he tells us that, in spite of the homeliness of\r\nher domestic arrangements, he found both the wine and the cuisine very\r\ngood. After dinner he was ushered into the presence of his hostess,\r\nwho welcomed him cordially, and had exactly the appearance of a\r\nprophetess, 'not the divine Sibyl of Domenichino, but a good,\r\nbusiness-like, practical prophetess.' Her face was of astonishing\r\nwhiteness, her dress a mass of white linen loosely folded round her\r\nlike a surplice. As he gazed upon her, he recalled the stories that he\r\nhad heard of her early days, of the capable manner in which she had\r\narranged the political banquets and receptions of Pitt, and the awe\r\nwith which the Tory country gentlemen had regarded her. That awe had\r\nbeen transferred to the sheikhs and pashas of the East, but now that,\r\nwith age and poverty, her earthly power was fading away, she had\r\ncreated for herself a spiritual kingdom.\r\n\r\nAfter a few inquiries about her Somersetshire friends, the prophetess\r\nsoared into loftier spheres, and discoursed of astrology and other\r\noccult sciences. 'For hours and hours this wonderful white woman\r\npoured forth her speech, for the most part concerning sacred and\r\nprofane mysteries.' From time to time she would swoop down to worldly\r\ntopics, 'and then,' as her auditor frankly observes, 'I was\r\ninterested.' She described her life in the Arab camps, and explained\r\nthat her influence over the tribes was partly due to her long sight, a\r\nquality held in high esteem in the desert, and partly to a brusque,\r\ndownright manner, which is always effective with Orientals. She\r\nprofessed to have fasted physically and mentally for years, living\r\nonly on milk, and reading neither books nor newspapers. Her unholy\r\nclaim to supremacy in the spiritual kingdom was based, in Kinglake's\r\nopinion, on her fierce, inordinate pride, perilously akin to madness,\r\nthough her mind was too strong to be entirely overcome. As a proof of\r\nLady Hester's high courage, he notes the fact that, after the fall of\r\nAcre, her house was the only spot in Syria and Palestine where the\r\nwill of Mehemet Ali and his fierce lieutenant was not law. Ibrahim\r\nPasha had demanded that the Albanian soldiers should be given up, and\r\ntheir protectress had challenged him to come and take them. This\r\nhillock of Dar Jôon always kept its freedom as long as Chatham's\r\ngranddaughter lived, and Mehemet Ali confessed that the Englishwoman\r\nhad given him more trouble than all the insurgents of Syria. Kinglake\r\ndid not see the famous sacred mares, but before his departure he was\r\nshown the gardens by the Italian secretary, who was in great distress\r\nof mind because he could not bring himself to believe implicitly in\r\nhis employer's divine attributes. He said that Lady Hester was\r\nregarded with mingled respect and dislike by the neighbours, whom she\r\noppressed by her exactions. The few 'respected' inhabitants of Mount\r\nLebanon apparently claimed the right to avail themselves of their\r\nneighbours' goods; and the White Queen's establishment was supported\r\nby contributions from the surrounding villages. This is quite a\r\ndifferent account from that given by Dr. Meryon, who always represents\r\nLady Hester as a generous benefactress, admired and adored in all the\r\ncountry-side.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Lady Hester discovered another mare's nest in the shape of a\r\nlegacy which she chose to believe was being kept from her by her\r\nenemies. In August of this year she wrote to Dr. Meryon, who was then\r\nliving at Nice, and invited him to come and assist her in settling her\r\ndebts, and getting possession of this supposititious property. 'A\r\nwoman of high rank and good fortune,' she continues, 'who has built\r\nherself a _palais_ in a remote part of America, has announced her\r\nintention of passing the rest of her life with me, so much has she\r\nbeen struck with my situation and conduct. [Footnote: This was the\r\nBaroness de Feriat, who did not carry out her intention.] She is\r\nnearly of my age, and thirty-seven years ago--I being personally\r\nunknown to her--was so taken with my general appearance, that she\r\nnever could divest herself of the thoughts of me, which have ever\r\nsince pursued her. At last, informed by M. Lamartine's book where I\r\nwas to be found, she took this extraordinary determination, and in the\r\nspring I expect her. She is now selling her large landed estate,\r\npreparatory to her coming. She, as well as Leila the mare, is in the\r\nprophecy. The beautiful boy has also written, and is wandering over\r\nthe face of the globe till destiny marks the period of our meeting....\r\nI am reckoned here the first politician in the world, and by some a\r\nsort of prophet. Even the Emir wonders, and is astonished, for he was\r\nnot aware of this extraordinary gift; but yet all say--I mean\r\nenemies--that I am worse than a lion when in a passion, and that they\r\ncannot deny I have justice on my side.'\r\n\r\nAfter his former experience of Lady Hester's hospitality it is\r\nsurprising that the doctor should have been willing to accept this\r\ninvitation, and still more surprising that his wife should have\r\nconsented to accompany him to Syria. But the East was still\r\n'a-calling,' and the almost hypnotic influence which her ladyship\r\nexercised over her dependants seems to have lost none of its efficacy.\r\nAccordingly, as soon as the Meryons could arrange their affairs, they\r\nembarked at Marseilles, landing at Beyrout on July 1, 1837. Here the\r\ndoctor received a letter from Lady Hester, recommending him to leave\r\nhis family at Beyrout till he could find a house for them at Sayda.\r\n'For your sake,' she continued, 'I should ever wish to show civility\r\nto all who belong to you, but caprice I will never interfere with, for\r\nfrom my early youth I have been taught to despise it.' Here was signal\r\nproof that the past had not been forgotten, and that war was still to\r\nbe waged against the unfortunate Mrs. Meryon. In defiance of Lady\r\nHester's orders, the whole family proceeded to Sayda, whence Dr.\r\nMeryon rode over to Dar Jôon. He received a warm personal welcome, but\r\nhis hostess persisted in her statement that there was no house in the\r\nvillage fit for the reception of his womenkind, as nearly all had been\r\ndamaged by recent earthquakes. It was finally arranged that Mrs.\r\nMeryon and her children should go for the present to Mar Elias, which\r\nwas then only occupied by the Prophet Loustaunau.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lady Hester's financial affairs were becoming desperate,\r\nand she had even been reduced to selling some of her handsome\r\npelisses. Yet she still maintained between thirty and forty servants,\r\nand when it was suggested to her that she might reduce her\r\nestablishment, she was accustomed to reply, 'But my rank!' Her\r\nlive-stock included the two sacred mares, three 'amblers,' five asses,\r\na flock of sheep, and a few cows. A herd of a hundred goats had\r\nrecently been slaughtered in one day, because their owner fancied that\r\nshe was being cheated by her goatherd. Now she decided to have the\r\nthree 'amblers' shot, because the grooms treated them improperly. The\r\nunder-bailiff received orders to whisper into the ear of each horse\r\nbefore his execution, 'You have worked enough upon the earth; your\r\nmistress fears you might fall, in your old age, into the hands of\r\ncruel men, and she therefore dismisses you from her service.' This\r\norder was carried out to the letter, with imperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\nAfter a short experience of the inconvenience of riding to and fro\r\nbetween Jôon and Mar Elias, Dr. Meryon persuaded his employer to allow\r\nhim to bring his family to a cottage in the village; but the nearer\r\nthe time approached for their arrival, the more she seemed to regret\r\nhaving assented to the arrangement. Frequent and scathing were her\r\nlectures upon the exigent ways of women, who, she argued, should be\r\nsimple automata, moved only by the will and guidance of their masters.\r\nShe lost no opportunity of throwing ridicule on Dr. Meryon's desire to\r\nhave his family near him, in order that he might pass his evenings\r\nwith them, pointing out that 'all sensible men take their meals with\r\ntheir wives, and then retire to their own rooms to read, write, or do\r\nwhat best pleases them. Nobody is such a fool as to moider away his\r\ntime in the slipslop conversation of a pack of women.' Petty\r\njealousies, quite inconsistent with her boasted philosophy, were\r\nperpetually tormenting her. One of the many monopolies claimed by her\r\nwas that of the privilege of bell-ringing. The Mahometans, as is well\r\nknown, never use bells in private houses, the usual summons for\r\nservants being three claps of the hands. But Lady Hester was a\r\nconstant and vehement bell-ringer, and as no one else in the\r\ncountry-side possessed house-bells, it was generally believed that the\r\nuse of them was a special privilege granted her by the Porte. She was\r\ntherefore secretly much annoyed when the Meryons presumed to hang up\r\nbells in their new home. She made no sign of displeasure, but one\r\nmorning it was discovered that the ropes had been cut and the bells\r\ncarried off. Cross-examination of the servants elicited the fact that\r\none of Lady Hester's emissaries had arrived late at night, wrenched\r\noff the bells, and taken them away. Some weeks later the Lady of Jôon\r\nconfessed that she had instigated the act, and declared that if the\r\nMeryons' bells had hung much longer her own would not have been\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nSoon after the doctor's arrival, Lady Hester had dictated a letter to\r\nSir Francis Burdett, in whom she placed great confidence, informing\r\nhim of the property that she believed was being withheld from her, and\r\nrequesting him to make inquiries into the matter. When not engaged in\r\ncorrespondence, discussing her debts, and scolding her servants, she\r\nwas pouring out floods of conversation, chiefly reminiscences of her\r\nyouth and diatribes against the men and manners of the present day,\r\ninto the ears of the long-suffering doctor. 'From her manner towards\r\nother people,' he observes, 'it would have seemed that she was the\r\nonly person in creation privileged to abuse and to command; others had\r\nnothing to do but to obey. She was haughty and overbearing, born to\r\nrule, impatient of control, and more at her ease when she had a\r\nhundred persons to govern than when she had only ten. Had she been a\r\nman and a soldier, she would have been what the French call a _beau\r\nsabreur_, for never was any one so fond of wielding weapons, and\r\nboasting of her capacity for using them, as she was. In her bedroom\r\nshe always had a mace, which was spiked round the head, a steel\r\nbattle-axe, and a dagger, but her favourite weapon was the mace.'\r\nAbsurd as it may sound, it was probably her military vanity that led\r\nher to belittle the Duke of Wellington, of whose reputation she seems\r\nto have felt some personal jealousy. Yet she bears testimony to the\r\nesteem in which 'Arthur Wellesley' was held by William Pitt.\r\n\r\n'I recollect, one day,' she told the doctor, 'Mr. Pitt came into the\r\ndrawing-room to me, and said, \"Oh, how I have been bored by Sir Sydney\r\nSmith coming with his box full of papers, and keeping me for a couple\r\nof hours, when I had so much to do.\" I observed to him that heroes\r\nwere generally vain, and that Lord Nelson was so. \"So he is,\" replied\r\nMr. Pitt, \"but not like Sir Sydney. And how different is Arthur\r\nWellesley, who has just quitted me! He has given me such clear details\r\nupon affairs in India; and he talked of them, too, as if he had been a\r\nsurgeon of a regiment, and had nothing to do with them; so that I know\r\nnot which to admire most, his modesty or his talents, and yet the fate\r\nof India depends upon them.\" Then, doctor, when I recollect the letter\r\nhe wrote to Edward Bouverie, in which he said he could not come down\r\nto a ball because his only corbeau coat was so bad he was ashamed to\r\nappear in it, I reflect what a rise he has had in the world. He was at\r\nfirst nothing but what hundreds of others are in a country town--he\r\ndanced hard and drank hard. His star has done everything for him, for\r\nhe is not a great general. He is no tactician, nor has he any of those\r\ngreat qualities that make a Caesar, a Pompey, or even a Bonaparte. As\r\nfor the battle of Waterloo, both French and English have told me that\r\nit was a lucky battle for him, but nothing more. I don't think he\r\nacted well at Paris, nor did the soldiers like him.'\r\n\r\nAbout the end of October Lady Hester took to her bed, and did not\r\nleave it till the following March. She had suffered from pulmonary\r\ncatarrh for several years, which disappeared in the summer, but\r\nreturned every winter with increased violence. Her practice of\r\nfrequent bleeding had brought on a state of complete emaciation, and\r\nleft very little blood in her body. If she had lived like other\r\npeople, and trusted to the balmy air of Syria, Dr. Meryon was of\r\nopinion that nothing serious need have been apprehended from her\r\nillness. But she seldom breathed the outer air, and took no exercise\r\nexcept an occasional turn in the garden. She was always complaining\r\nthat she could get nothing to eat; yet, in spite of her profession (to\r\nKinglake) that she lived entirely on milk, we are told that her diet\r\nconsisted of forcemeat balls, meat-pies, and other heavy viands, and\r\nthat she seldom remained half an hour without taking nourishment of\r\nsome kind. 'I never knew a human being who took nourishment so\r\nfrequently,' writes Dr. Meryon, 'and may not this in some measure\r\naccount for her frequent ill-humour?'\r\n\r\nDuring her illness the doctor read aloud Sir Nathaniel Wraxall's\r\n_Memoirs_ and the _Memoirs of a Peeress_, edited by Lady Charlotte\r\nBury, both of which books dealt with persons whom Lady Hester\r\nhad known in her youth. In return she regaled him with stories\r\nof her own glory, of Mr. Pitt's virtues, of the objectionable habits\r\nof the Princess of Wales, and of the meanness of the Regent in\r\ninviting himself to dinner with gentlemen who could not afford to\r\nentertain him, the whole pleasantly flavoured by animadversions on the\r\nsocial presumption of medical men, and descriptions of the methods by\r\nwhich formerly they were kept in their proper place by aristocratic\r\npatients. At this time, the beginning of 1838, Lady Hester was\r\nanxiously expecting an answer from Sir Francis Burdett about her\r\nproperty, and, hearing from the English consul at Sayda that a packet\r\nhad arrived for her from Beyrout, which was to be delivered into her\r\nown hands, her sanguine mind was filled with the hope of coming\r\nprosperity. But when the packet was opened, instead of the\r\nlong-expected missive from Sir Francis, it proved to be an official\r\nstatement from Colonel Campbell, Consul-General for Egypt, that in\r\nconsequence of an application made to the British Government by one of\r\nLady Hester's chief creditors, an order had come from Lord Palmerston\r\nthat her pension was to be stopped unless the debt was paid. When she\r\nread the letter Dr. Meryon feared an outburst of fury, but Lady\r\nHester, who, for once, was beyond violence, began calmly to discuss\r\nthe enormity of the conduct both of Queen and Minister.\r\n\r\n'My grandfather and Mr. Pitt,' she said, 'did something to keep the\r\nBrunswick family on the throne, and yet the granddaughter of the old\r\nking, without hearing the circumstances of my getting into debt, or\r\nwhether the story is true, sends to deprive me of my pension in a\r\nstrange land, where I may remain and starve.... I should like to ask\r\nfor a public inquiry into my debts, and for what I have contracted\r\nthem. Let them compare the good I have done in the cause of humanity\r\nand science with the Duke of Kent's debts. I wonder if Lord Palmerston\r\nis the man I recollect--a young man from college, who was always\r\nhanging about waiting to be introduced to Mr. Pitt. Mr. Pitt used to\r\nsay, \"Ah, very well; we will ask him to dinner some day.\" Perhaps it\r\nis an old grudge that makes him vent his spite.' Colonel Campbell's\r\nletter had given the poor lady's heart, or rather her pride, a fatal\r\nstab, and the indignity with which she had been treated preyed upon\r\nher health and spirits. She now determined to send an ultimatum to the\r\nQueen, which was to be published in the newspapers if ministers\r\nrefused to lay it before her Majesty. This document, which was dated\r\nFebruary 12, 1838, ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty will allow me to say that few things are more\r\ndisgraceful and inimical to royalty than giving commands without\r\nexamining all their different bearings, and casting, without reason,\r\nan aspersion upon the integrity of any branch of a family that had\r\nfaithfully served their country and the House of Hanover. As no\r\ninquiries have been made of me of what circumstances induced me to\r\nincur the debts alluded to, I deem it unnecessary to enter into any\r\ndetails on the subject. I shall not allow the pension given by your\r\nroyal grandfather to be stopped by force; but I shall resign it for\r\nthe payment of my debts, and with it the name of British subject, and\r\nthe slavery that is at present annexed to it; and as your Majesty has\r\ngiven publicity to the business by your orders to your consular\r\nagents, I surely cannot be blamed for following your royal example.\r\n\r\n'HESTER LUCY STANHOPE.'\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied by a long letter to the Duke of Wellington, in\r\nwhich Lady Hester detailed her services in the East, and expressed her\r\nindignation at the treatment she had received. She was now left with\r\nonly a few pounds upon which to maintain her house-hold until March,\r\nwhen she could draw for £300, apparently the quarter's income from a\r\nlegacy left her by her brother, but of this sum £200 was due to a\r\nGreek merchant at Beyrout. The faithful doctor collected all the money\r\nhe had in his house, about eleven pounds, and brought it to her for\r\nher current expenses, but with her usual impracticability she gave\r\nmost of it away in charity. Still no letter came from Sir Francis\r\nBurdett, and the unfortunate lady, old, sick, and wasted to a\r\nskeleton, lay on her sofa and lamented over her troubles in a fierce,\r\ninhuman fashion, like a wounded animal at bay. In the course of time a\r\nreply came from Lord Palmerston, in which he stated that he had laid\r\nLady Hester's letter before the Queen, and explained to her Majesty\r\nthe circumstances that might be supposed to have led to her writing\r\nit. The communications to which she referred were, he continued,\r\nsuggested by nothing but a desire to save her from the embarrassments\r\nthat might arise if her creditors were to call upon the Consul-General\r\nto act according to the strict line of his duty. This letter did\r\nnothing towards assuaging Lady Hester's wrath. In her reply she\r\nsarcastically observed:--\r\n\r\n'If your diplomatic despatches are all as obscure as the one that now\r\nlies before me, it is no wonder that England should cease to have that\r\nproud preponderance in her foreign relations which she once could\r\nboast of.... It is but fair to make your lordship aware that, if by\r\nthe next packet there is nothing definitely settled respecting my\r\naffairs, and I am not cleared in the eyes of the world of aspersions,\r\nintentionally or unintentionally thrown upon me, I shall break up my\r\nhousehold, and build up the entrance-gate to my premises; there\r\nremaining as if I was in a tomb till my character has been done\r\njustice to, and a public acknowledgment put in the papers, signed and\r\nsealed by those who have aspersed me. There is no trifling with those\r\nwho have Pitt blood in their veins upon the subject of integrity, nor\r\nexpecting that their spirit would ever yield to the impertinent\r\ninterference of consular authority, etc., etc.' It must be owned that\r\nthere is a touch of unconscious humour in Lady Hester's terrible\r\nthreat of walling herself up, a proceeding which would only make\r\nherself uncomfortable and leave her enemies at peace. For the present\r\nmatters went on much as usual at Dar Jôon. No household expenses were\r\ncurtailed, and thirty native servants continued to cheat their\r\nmistress and idle over their work. In March, that perambulating\r\nprinceling, his Highness of Pückler-Muskau, arrived at Sayda, whence\r\nhe wrote a letter to Lady Hester, begging to be allowed to pay his\r\nhomage to the Queen of Palmyra and the niece of the great Pitt. 'I\r\nhave the presumption to believe, madam,' he continued, 'that there\r\nmust be some affinity of character between us. For, like you, my lady,\r\nI look for our future salvation from the East, where nations still\r\nnearer to God and to nature can alone, some day, purify the rotten\r\ncivilisation of decrepid Europe, in which everything is artificial,\r\nand where we are menaced with a new kind of barbarism--not that with\r\nwhich states begin, but with which they end. Like you, madam, I\r\nbelieve that astrology is not an empty science, but a lost one. Like\r\nyou, I am an aristocrat by birth and by principle; because I find a\r\nmarked aristocracy in nature. In a word, madam, like you, I love to\r\nsleep by day and be stirring by night. There I stop; for in mind,\r\nenergy of character, and in the mode of life, so singular and so\r\ndignified, which you lead, not every one who would can resemble Lady\r\nHester Stanhope.'\r\n\r\nLady Hester was flattered by this letter, and told the doctor that he\r\nmust ride into Sayda to see the prince, and tell him that she was too\r\nill to receive him at present, but would endeavour to do so a few\r\nweeks later. The prince was established with his numerous suite in the\r\nhouse of a merchant of Sayda. Mehemet Ali had given him a special\r\nfirman, requiring all official persons to treat him in a manner\r\nsuitable to his rank, his whole expenditure being defrayed by cheques\r\non the Viceroy's treasury. The prince, unlike most other distinguished\r\ntravellers who were treated with the same honour, took the firman\r\nstrictly according to the letter, and could boast of having traversed\r\nthe whole of Egypt and Syria with all the pomp of royalty, and without\r\nhaving expended a single farthing. Dr. Meryon describes his Highness\r\nas a tall man of about fifty years of age, distinguished by an\r\nunmistakable air of birth and breeding. He wore a curious mixture of\r\nEastern and Western costume, and had a tame chameleon crawling about\r\nhis pipe, with which he was almost as much occupied as M. Lamartine\r\nwith his lapdog. The prince stated that he had almost made up his mind\r\nto settle in the East, since Europe was no longer the land of liberty.\r\n'I will build myself a house,' he said, 'get what I want from Europe,\r\nmake arrangements for newspapers, books, etc., and choose some\r\ndelightful situation; but I think it will be on Mount Lebanon.'\r\n\r\nIn his volume of travels in the East called _Die Rückkehr_,\r\nPrince Pückler-Muksau has given an amusing account of the negotiations\r\nthat passed between himself and Lady Hester on the subject of his\r\nvisit. For once the niece of Pitt had found her match in vanity and\r\narrogance; and if the prince's book had appeared in her lifetime, it\r\nis certain that she would not long have survived it. His Highness\r\ndescribes how he bided his time, as though he were laying siege to a\r\ncourted beauty, and almost daily bombarded the Lady of Jôon with\r\nletters calculated to pique her curiosity by their frank and original\r\nstyle. At last, 'in order to be rid of him,' as she jokingly said,\r\nLady Hester consented to receive him on a certain day, which, from his\r\nstar, she deemed propitious to their meeting. Thereupon the prince,\r\nwho intended that his visit should be desired, not suffered, wrote to\r\nsay that he was setting out for an expedition into the desert, but\r\nthat on his return he would come to Jôon, not for one day, but for a\r\nweek. This impertinence was rewarded by permission to come at his own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGreat preparations were made for the entertainment of this\r\ndistinguished visitor. The scanty contents of the store and china\r\ncupboards were spread out before the lady of the house, who infused\r\nactivity into the most sluggish by smart strokes from her stick. The\r\nepithets of beast, rascal, and the like, were dealt out with such\r\nfreedom and readiness, as to make the European part of her audience\r\nsensible of the richness and variety of the Arabian language. On\r\nEaster Monday, April 15, the prince, followed by a part of his suite,\r\nand five mule-loads of baggage, rode into the courtyard. He wore an\r\nimmense Leghorn hat lined with green taffetas, a Turkish scarf over\r\nhis shoulders, and blue pantaloons of ample dimensions. From the\r\nexcellent fit of his Parisian boots, it was evident that he felt his\r\npretensions to a thoroughbred foot were now to be magisterially\r\ndecided. The prince has given his own impression of his hostess, whom\r\nhe describes as a thorough woman of the world, with manners of\r\nOriental dignity and calm. With her pale, regular features, dark,\r\nfiery eyes, great height, and sonorous voice, she had the appearance\r\nof an ancient Sibyl; yet no one, he declares, could have been more\r\nnatural and unaffected in manner. She told him that since she had lost\r\nher money, she had lived like a dervish, and assimilated herself to\r\nthe ways of nature. 'My roses are my jewels,' she said, 'the sun and\r\nmoon my clocks, fruit and water my food and drink. I see in your face\r\nthat you are a thorough epicure; how will you endure to spend a week\r\nwith me?' The prince, who had already dined, replied that he found she\r\ndid not keep her guests on fruit and water, and assured her that\r\nEnglish poverty was equivalent to German riches. He spent six or seven\r\nhours _tête-a-tête_ with his hostess each evening of his stay,\r\nand declares that he was astonished at the originality and variety of\r\nher conversation. He had the audacity to ask her if the Arab chief who\r\naccompanied her to Palmyra had been her lover, but she, not\r\nill-pleased, assured him that there was no truth in the report, which\r\nat one time had been generally believed. She said that the Arabs\r\nregarded her neither as man or woman, but as a being apart.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, the prince introduced his 'harem,' consisting of two\r\nAbyssinian slaves, to Lady Hester, and was presented, in his turn, to\r\nthe sacred mares, which had lost their beauty, and grown gross and\r\nunwieldy under their _régime_ of gentle exercise and unlimited\r\nfood. Leila licked the prince's hand when he caressed her, and Leila's\r\nmistress was thereby convinced that her guest was a 'chosen vessel.'\r\nShe confided to him all her woes, the neglect of her relations and the\r\nill-treatment of the Government, and gave him copies of the\r\ncorrespondence about her pension, which he promised to publish in a\r\nGerman newspaper. To Dr. Meryon she waxed quite enthusiastic over his\r\nHighness's personal attractions, the excellent cut of his coat, and\r\nthe handiness with which he performed small services. 'I could\r\nobserve,' writes the doctor, towards the end of the visit, 'that she\r\nhad already begun to obtain an ascendency over the prince, such as she\r\nnever failed to do over those who came within the sphere of her\r\nattraction; for he was less lofty in his manner than he had been at\r\nfirst, and she seemed to have gained in height, and to be more\r\ndisposed to play the queen than ever.'\r\n\r\nThis, alas, was the last time that Lady Hester had the opportunity of\r\nplaying the queen, or entertaining a distinguished guest at Dar Jôon.\r\nIn June, when the packet brought no news of her imaginary property,\r\nand no apology from Queen or Premier, she began at last to despair.\r\n'The die is cast,' she told Dr. Meryon, 'and the sooner you take\r\nyourself off the better. I have no money; you can be of no use to\r\nme--I shall write no more letters, and shall break up my\r\nestablishment, wall up my gate, and, with a boy and girl to wait upon\r\nme, resign myself to my fate. Tell your family they may make their\r\npreparations, and be gone in a month's time.' Early in July Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett's long-expected letter arrived, but brought with it no\r\nconsolation. He could tell nothing of the legacy, but wrote in the\r\nsoothing, evasive terms that might be supposed suitable to an elderly\r\nlady who was not quite accountable for her ideas or actions. As there\r\nwas now no hope of any improvement in her affairs, Lady Hester decided\r\nto execute her threat of walling up her gateway, a proceeding which,\r\nshe was unable to perceive, injured nobody but herself. She directed\r\nthe doctor to pay and dismiss her servants, with the exception of two\r\nmaids and two men, and then sent him to Beyrout to inform the French\r\nconsul of her intention. On his return to Jôon he found that Lady\r\nHester had already hired a vessel to take himself and his family from\r\nSayda to Cyprus. He was reluctant to leave her in solitude and\r\nwretchedness, but knowing that when once her mind was made up, nothing\r\ncould shake her resolution, he employed the time that remained to him\r\nin writing her letters, setting her house in order, and taking her\r\ninstructions for commissions in Europe. He also begged to be allowed\r\nto lend her as much money as he could spare, and she consented to\r\nborrow a sum of 2000 piastres (about £80), which she afterwards\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nOn July 30, 1838, the masons arrived, and the entrance-gate was walled\r\nup with a kind of stone screen, leaving, however, a side-opening just\r\nlarge enough for an ass or cow to enter, so that this much-talked-of\r\nact of self-immurement was more an appearance than a reality. On\r\nAugust 6, the faithful doctor took an affectionate leave of the\r\nemployer, who, as Prince Pückler-Muskau bears witness, was accustomed\r\nto treat him with icy coldness, and sailed for western climes. To the\r\nlast, he tells us, Lady Hester dwelt with apparent confidence on the\r\napproaching advent of the Mahedi, and still regarded her mare Leila as\r\ndestined to bear him into Jerusalem, with herself upon Lulu at his\r\nside. It is to be hoped that the poor lady was able to buoy herself up\r\nwith this belief during the last and most solitary year of her\r\ndisappointed life. About once a month, up to the date of her death,\r\nshe corresponded with Dr. Meryon, who was again settled at Nice. Her\r\nletters were chiefly taken up with commissions, and with shrewd\r\ncomments upon the new books that were sent out to her.\r\n\r\n'I should like to have Miss Pardoe's book on Constantinople,' she\r\nwrites in October, 1838, 'if it is come out for strangers (_i.e._\r\nin a French translation); for I fear I should never get through with\r\nit myself. This just puts me in mind that one of the books I should\r\nlike to have would be Graham's _Domestic Medicine_; a good Red\r\nBook (_Peerage_, I mean); and the book about the Prince of Wales.\r\nI have found out a person who can occasionally read French to me; so\r\nif there was any very pleasing French book, you might send it--but no\r\nBonapartes or \"present times\"--and a little _brochure_ or two\r\nupon baking, pastry, gardening, etc....\r\n\r\n'_Feb._ 9, 1839.--The book you sent me (_Diary of the Times of\r\nGeorge IV_., by Lady Charlotte Bury) is interesting only to those\r\nwho were acquainted with the persons named: all mock taste, mock\r\nfeeling, etc., but that is the fashion. \"I am this, I am that\"; who\r\never talked such empty stuff formerly? I was never named by a\r\nwell-bred person.... Miss Pardoe is very excellent upon many subjects;\r\nonly there is too much of what the English like--stars, winds, black\r\nshades, soft sounds, etc....\r\n\r\n'_May_ 6.--Some one--I suppose you--sent me the _Life of Lord\r\nEdward Fitzgerald_. It is _I_ who could give a true and most\r\nextraordinary history of all those transactions. The book is all\r\nstuff. The duchess (Lord Edward's mother) was my particular friend, as\r\nwas also his aunt; I was intimate with all the family, and knew that\r\nnoted Pamela. All the books I see make me sick--only catchpenny\r\nnonsense. A thousand thanks for the promise of my grandfather's\r\nletters; but the book will be all spoilt by being edited by young men.\r\nFirst, they are totally ignorant of the politics of my grandfather's\r\nage; secondly, of the style of the language used at that period; and\r\nabsolutely ignorant of his secret reasons and intentions, and the\r\n_real_ or apparent footing he was upon with many people, friends\r\nor foes. I know all that from my grandmother, who was his secretary,\r\nand, Coutts used to say, the cleverest _man_ of her time in\r\npolitics and business.'\r\n\r\nThis was the last letter that Dr. Meryon received from his old friend\r\nand patroness. She slowly wasted away, and died in June 1839, no one\r\nbeing aware of her approaching end except the servants about her. The\r\nnews of her death reached Beyrout in a few hours, and the English\r\nconsul, Mr. Moore, and an American missionary (Mr. Thomson, author of\r\n_The Land and the Book_) rode over to Jôon to bury her. By her\r\nown desire she was interred in a grave in her garden, where a son of\r\nthe Prophet Loustaunau had been buried some years before. Mr. Thomson\r\nhas described how he performed the last rites at midnight by the light\r\nof lanterns and torches, and notes the curious resemblance between\r\nLady Hester's funeral service and that of the man she loved, Sir John\r\nMoore. Together with the consul, he examined the contents of\r\nthirty-five rooms, but found nothing but old saddles, pipes, and empty\r\noil-jars, everything of value having been long since plundered by the\r\nservants. The sacred mares, now grown old and almost useless, were\r\nsold for a small sum by public auction, and only survived for a short\r\ntime their return to an active life.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Dr. Meryon published his so-called _Memoirs of Lady Hester\r\nStanhope_, which are merely an account of her later years, and a\r\nreport of her table-talk at Dar Jôon. In 1846 he brought out her\r\n_Travels_, which were advertised as the supplement and completion\r\nof the _Memoirs_. From these works, and from passing notices of\r\nour heroine, we gain a general impression of wasted talents and a\r\ndisappointed life. That she was more unhappy in her solitude than, in\r\nher unbending nature, she would avow, observes her faithful friend and\r\nchronicler, the record of the last years of her existence too plainly\r\ndemonstrates. Although she derived consolation in retirement from the\r\nretrospect of the part she had played in her prosperity, still there\r\nwere moments of poignant grief when her very soul groaned within her.\r\nShe was ambitious, and her ambition had been foiled; she loved\r\nirresponsible command, but the time had come when those over whom she\r\nruled defied her; she was dictatorial and exacting, but she had lost\r\nthe influence which alone makes people tolerate control. She incurred\r\ndebts, and was doomed to feel the degradation consequent upon them.\r\nShe thought to defy her own nation, and they hurled the defiance back\r\nupon her. She entertained visionary projects of aggrandisement, and\r\nwas met by the derision of the world. In a word, Lady Hester died as\r\nshe had lived, alone and miserable in a strange land, bankrupt in\r\naffection and credit, because, in spite of her great gifts and innate\r\nbenevolence, her overbearing temper had alienated friends and kinsfolk\r\nalike, and her pride could endure neither the society of equals, nor\r\nthe restraints and conventions of civilised life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE PÜCKLER-MUSKAU IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE PÜCKLER-MUSKAU]\r\n\r\nDuring the early and middle decades of the nineteenth century there\r\nwas no more original and picturesque figure among the minor\r\ncelebrities of Germany--one might almost say of Europe--than that of\r\nhis Highness, Hermann Ludwig Heinrich, Prince Pückler-Muskau.\r\nThroughout his long career we find this princeling playing many\r\nparts--at once an imitation Werter, a sentimental Don Juan, a dandy\r\nwho out-dressed D'Orsay, a sportsman and traveller of Münchhausen\r\ntype, a fashionable author who wrote German with a French accent and a\r\nwarrior who seems to have wandered out of the pages of mediæval\r\nromance. Yet with all his mock-heroic notoriety, the _toller\r\nPückler_ was by no means destitute of those practical qualities\r\nwhich tempered the Teutonic Romanticism, even in its earliest and most\r\nextravagant developments. He was skilled in all manly exercises, a\r\nbrave soldier, an intelligent observer, and--his most substantial\r\nclaim to remembrance--the father of landscape-gardening in Germany, a\r\nveritable magician who transformed level wastes into wooded landscapes\r\nand made the sandy wildernesses blossom like the rose.\r\n\r\nTo English readers the prince's name was once familiar as the author\r\nof _Briefe eines Verstorbenen_ (Letters of a Dead Man), which\r\ncontain a lively account of his Highness' sojourn in England and\r\nIreland between the years 1826 and 1828. These letters, which were\r\ntranslated into English under the title of _The Tour of a German\r\nPrince_, made a sensation, favourable and otherwise, in the early\r\n'thirties,' owing to the candid fashion in which they dealt with our\r\ncustoms and our countrymen. The book received the high honour of a\r\ncomplimentary review from the pen of the aged Goethe. 'The writer\r\nappears to be a perfect and experienced man of the world,' observes\r\nthis distinguished critic; 'endowed with talents and a quick\r\napprehension; formed by a varied social existence, by travel and\r\nextensive connections. His journey was undertaken very recently, and\r\nbrings us the latest intelligence from the countries which he has\r\nviewed with an acute, clear, and comprehensive eye. We see before us a\r\nfinely-constituted being, born to great external advantages and\r\nfelicities, but in whom a lively spirit of enterprise is not united to\r\nconstancy and perseverance; whence he experiences frequent failure and\r\ndisappointment.... The peculiarities of English manners and habits are\r\ndrawn vividly and distinctly, and without exaggeration. We acquire a\r\nlively idea of that wonderful combination, that luxuriant growth--of\r\nthat insular life which is based in boundless wealth and civil\r\nfreedom, in universal monotony and manifold diversity; formal and\r\ncapricious, active and torpid, energetic and dull, comfortable and\r\ntedious, the envy and derision of the world. Like other unprejudiced\r\ntravellers of modern times, our author is not very much enchanted with\r\nthe English form of existence: his cordial and sincere admiration is\r\noften accompanied by unsparing censure. He is by no means inclined to\r\nfavour the faults and weaknesses of the English; and in this he has\r\nthe greatest and best among themselves upon his side.'\r\n\r\nAs these Letters were not written until the prince had passed his\r\nfortieth year, it will be necessary, before considering them in\r\ndetail, to give a brief sketch of his previous career. Hermann Ludwig\r\nwas the only son of Graf von Pückler of Schloss Branitz, and of his\r\nwife, Clementine, born a Gräfin von Gallenberg, and heiress to the\r\nvast estate of Muskau in Silesia. Both families were of immense\r\nantiquity, the Pücklers claiming to trace their descent from Rüdiger\r\nvon Bechlarn, who figures in the _Nibelungenlied_. Our hero was\r\nborn at Muskau in October 1785, and spent, according to his own\r\naccount, a wretched and neglected childhood. His father was harsh,\r\nmiserly, and suspicious; his mother, who was only fifteen when her son\r\nwas born, is described as a frivolous little flirt. The couple, after\r\nperpetually quarrelling for ten or twelve years, were divorced, by\r\nmutual consent, in 1797, and the Gräfin shortly afterwards married one\r\nof her numerous admirers, Graf von Seydewitz, with whom she lived as\r\nunhappily as with her first husband. Her little son was educated at a\r\nMoravian school, and in the holidays was left entirely to the care of\r\nthe servants. After a couple of years at the university of Leipzig, he\r\nentered the Saxon army, and soon became notorious for his good looks,\r\nhis fine horsemanship, his extravagance, and his mischievous pranks.\r\nMilitary discipline in time of peace proved too burdensome for the\r\nyoung lieutenant, who, after quarrelling with his father, getting\r\ndeeply into debt, and embroiling himself with the authorities, threw\r\nup his commission in 1804. Muskau having become much too hot to hold\r\nhim, he spent the next years in travelling about the Continent, always\r\nin pecuniary difficulties, and seldom free from some sentimental\r\nentanglement.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Graf Pückler died, and his son stepped into a splendid\r\ninheritance. Like Prince Hal, the young Graf seems to have taken his\r\nnew responsibilities seriously, and to have devoted himself, with only\r\ntoo much enthusiasm, to the development and improvement of his\r\nestates. In the intervals of business he amused himself with an\r\nendless series of love-affairs, his achievements in this respect, if\r\nhis biographer may be believed, more than equalling those of Jupiter\r\nand Don Giovanni put together. Old and young, pretty and plain, noble\r\nand humble, native and foreign, all were fish that came to the net of\r\nthis lady-killer, who not only vowed allegiance to nearly every\r\npetticoat that crossed his path, but--a much more remarkable\r\nfeat--kept up an impassioned correspondence with a large selection of\r\nhis charmers. After his death, a whole library of love-letters was\r\ndiscovered among his papers, all breathing forth adoration, ecstasy or\r\ndespair, and addressed to the Julies, Jeannettes, or Amalies who\r\nsucceeded one another so rapidly in his facile affections. These\r\ndocuments, for the most part carefully-corrected drafts of the\r\noriginals, were indorsed, 'Old love-letters, to be used again if\r\nrequired!'\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the trumpet of war sounded the call to arms, and the young\r\nGraf entered the military service of Prussia, and was appointed\r\naide-de-camp to the Duke of Saxe-Weimar. He distinguished himself in\r\nthe Netherlands, was present at the taking of Cassel, and in the\r\ncourse of the campaign played a part in a new species of duel. A\r\nFrench colonel of Hussars, so the story goes, rode out of the enemy's\r\nlines, and challenged any officer in the opposing army to single\r\ncombat. Pückler accepted the challenge, and the duel was fought on\r\nhorseback--presumably with sabres--between the ranks of the two\r\narmies, the soldiers on either side applauding their chosen champion.\r\nAt length, after a fierce struggle, Germany triumphed, and the brave\r\nFrenchman bit the dust. Whether the tale be true or apocryphal, it is\r\ncertain that numerous decorations were conferred upon the young\r\nofficer for his brilliant services, that he was promoted to the rank\r\nof colonel, and appointed civil and military governor of Brüges.\r\nPückler took part in the triumphal entry of the Allies into Paris, and\r\nafterwards accompanied the Duke of Saxe-Weimar to London, where he\r\nshared in all the festivities of the wonderful season of 1815, studied\r\nthe English methods of landscape-gardening, and made an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to marry a lady of rank and fortune.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Muskau the Graf continued his work on his estate,\r\nwhich, in spite of a sandy soil and other disadvantages, soon became\r\none of the show-places of Germany. Having discovered a spring of\r\nmineral water, he built a pump-room, a theatre, and a gaming-saloon,\r\nand named the establishment Hermannsbad. The invalids who frequented\r\nthe Baths must have enjoyed a lively 'cure,' for besides theatrical\r\nperformances, illuminations, fireworks and steeplechases, the Graf was\r\nalways ready to oblige with some sensational achievement. On one\r\noccasion he leapt his horse over the parapet of a bridge into the\r\nriver, and swam triumphantly ashore; while on another he galloped up\r\nthe steps of the Casino, played and won a _coup_ at the tables\r\nwithout dismounting, and then galloped down again, arriving at the\r\nbottom with a whole neck, but considerable damage to his horse's legs.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 Pückler became acquainted with Lucie, Gräfin von Pappenheim, a\r\ndaughter of Prince Hardenberg, Chancellor of Prussia. The Gräfin, a\r\nwell-preserved woman of forty, having parted from her husband, was\r\nliving at Berlin with her daughter, Adelheid, afterwards Princess\r\nCarolath, and her adopted daughter, Herminie Lanzendorf. The Graf\r\ndivided his attentions equally between the three ladies for some time,\r\nbut on inquiring of a friend which would make the greatest sensation\r\nin Berlin, his marriage to the mother or to one of the daughters, and\r\nbeing told his marriage to the mother, at once proposed to the\r\nmiddle-aged Gräfin, and was joyfully accepted. The reason for this\r\ninappropriate match probably lay deeper than the desire to astonish\r\nthe people of Berlin, for Pückler, with all his surface romanticism,\r\nhad a keen eye to the main chance. His Lucie had only a moderate\r\ndower, but the advantage of being son-in-law to the Chancellor of\r\nPrussia could hardly be overestimated. Again, the Graf seems to have\r\nimagined that in a marriage of convenience with a woman nine years\r\nolder than himself, he would be able to preserve the liberty of his\r\nbachelor days, while presenting the appearance of domestic\r\nrespectability.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the trifling formality of a divorce from Count Pappenheim\r\nhad been gone through, the marriage took place at Muskau, to the\r\naccompaniment of the most splendid festivities. As may be supposed,\r\nthe early married life of the ill-assorted couple was a period of\r\nanything but unbroken calm. Scarcely had the Graf surrendered his\r\nliberty than he fell passionately in love with his wife's adopted\r\ndaughter, Helmine, a beautiful girl of eighteen, the child, it was\r\nbelieved, of humble parents. Frederick William III. of Prussia was one\r\nof her admirers, and had offered to marry her morganatically, and\r\ncreate her Herzogin von Breslau. But Helmine gave her royal suitor no\r\nencouragement, and he soon consoled himself with the Princess\r\nLiegnitz. Lucie spared no pains to marry off the inconvenient beauty,\r\nbut Pückler frustrated all her efforts, implored her not to separate\r\nhim from Helmine, and suggested an arrangement based upon the domestic\r\npolicy of Goethe's _Wahlverwandschaften_. But Lucie was unreasonable\r\nenough to object to a _ménage à trois_, and at length succeeded\r\nin marrying Helmine to a Lieutenant von Blucher.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 the Graf accompanied his father-in-law to the Congress of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, and shortly afterwards was raised to princely rank,\r\nin compensation for the losses he had sustained through the annexation\r\nof Silesia by Prussia. By this time the prince's financial affairs\r\nwere in so desperate a condition, thanks to the follies of his youth\r\nand the building mania of his manhood, that a desperate remedy was\r\nrequired to put them straight again. Only one expedient presented\r\nitself, and this Lucie, with a woman's self-sacrifice, was the first\r\nto propose. During a short absence from Muskau she wrote to her\r\nhusband to offer him his freedom, in order that he might be enabled to\r\nmarry a rich heiress, whose fortune could be used to clear off the\r\nliabilities that pressed so heavily on the estate. The prince at first\r\nrefused to take advantage of this generous offer. He had become\r\naccustomed to his elderly wife, who acted as his colleague and helper\r\nin all that concerned his idolised Muskau, and upon whose sympathy and\r\nadvice he had learned to depend. But as time went on he grew\r\naccustomed to the idea of an amicable divorce, and at length persuaded\r\nhimself that such a proceeding need make no real difference to Lucie's\r\nposition; in fact, that it would be an advantage to her as well as to\r\nhimself. For years past he had regarded her rather in the light of a\r\nmaternal friend than of a wife, and the close _camaraderie_ that\r\nexisted between them would remain unbroken by the advent of a young\r\nbride whom Lucie would love as her own child. A divorce, it must be\r\nremembered, was a common incident of everyday life in the Germany of\r\nthat epoch. As we have seen, Pückler's father and mother had dissolved\r\ntheir marriage, and Lucie had been divorced from her first husband,\r\nwhile her father had been married three times, and had separated from\r\neach of his wives.\r\n\r\nThe matter remained in abeyance for a year or two, and it was not\r\nuntil 1826, when the prince probably felt that he had no time to lose,\r\nthat the long-talked-of divorce actually took place. This curious\r\ncouple, who appeared to be more tenderly attached to each other now\r\nthan they had ever been before, took a touching farewell in Berlin.\r\nThe princess then returned to Muskau, where she remained during her\r\nex-husband's absence as his agent and representative, while the prince\r\nset out for England, which country was supposed to offer the best\r\nhunting-ground for heiresses. Week by week during his tour, Pückler\r\naddressed to his faithful Lucie long, confidential letters, filled\r\nwith observations of the manners and customs of the British\r\nbarbarians, together with minute descriptions of his adventures in\r\nlove and landscape-gardening.\r\n\r\nThe prince, though at this time in his forty-first year, was still, to\r\nall appearance, in the prime of life, still an adept in feats of skill\r\nand strength, and not less romantic and susceptible than in the days\r\nof his youth. With his high rank, his vast though encumbered estates,\r\nhis picturesque appearance, and his wide experience in affairs of the\r\nheart, he anticipated little difficulty in carrying off one of the\r\nmost eligible of British heiresses; but he quite forgot to include the\r\nhard-hearted, level-headed British parent in his reckoning. The\r\nprince's first letter to Lucie, who figures in the published version\r\nas Julie, is dated Dresden, September 7, 1826, and begins in right\r\nWerterian strain:--\r\n\r\n'My dear friend--The love you showed me at our parting made me so\r\nhappy and so miserable that I cannot yet recover from it. Your sad\r\nimage is ever before me; I still read deep sorrow in your looks and in\r\nyour tears, and my own heart tells me too well what yours suffered.\r\nMay God grant us a meeting as joyful as our parting was sorrowful! I\r\ncan only repeat what I have so often told you, that if I felt myself\r\nwithout you, my dearest friend, in the world, I could enjoy none of\r\nits pleasures without an alloy of sadness; that if you love me, you\r\nwill above all things watch over your health, and amuse yourself as\r\nmuch as you can by varied occupation.' There are protestations of this\r\nkind in nearly every letter, for the prince's pen was always tipped\r\nwith fine sentiment and vows of eternal devotion came more easily to\r\nhim than the ordinary civilities of everyday life to the average man.\r\n\r\nA visit to Goethe at Weimar, on the traveller's leisurely journey\r\ntowards England, furnished his notebook with some interesting\r\nspecimens of the old poet's conversation. 'He received me,' writes the\r\nprince, 'in a dimly-lighted room, whose _clair obscure_ was\r\narranged with some _coquetterie_; and truly the aspect of the\r\nbeautiful old man, with his Jovelike countenance, was most stately....\r\nIn the course of conversation we came to Walter Scott. Goethe was not\r\nvery enthusiastic about the Great Unknown. He said he doubted not that\r\nhe wrote his novels in the same sort of partnership as existed between\r\nthe old painters and their pupils; that he furnished the plot, the\r\nleading thoughts, the skeleton of the scenes, that he then let his\r\npupils fill them up, and retouched them at the last. It seemed almost\r\nto be his opinion that it was not worth the while of a man of Scott's\r\neminence to give himself up to such a number of minute and tedious\r\ndetails. \"Had I,\" he said, \"been able to lend myself to the idea of\r\nmere gain, I could formerly have sent such things anonymously into the\r\nworld, with the aid of Lenz and others--nay, I could still, as would\r\nastonish people not a little, and make them puzzle their brains to\r\nfind out the author; but after all, they would be but manufactured\r\nwares....\"\r\n\r\n'He afterwards spoke of Lord Byron with great affection, almost as a\r\nfather would of a son, which was extremely grateful to my enthusiastic\r\nfeelings for this great poet. He contradicted the silly assertion\r\nthat _Manfred_ was only an echo of his _Faust_. He extremely\r\nregretted that he had never become personally acquainted with Lord\r\nByron, and severely and justly reproached the English nation for\r\nhaving judged their illustrious countryman so pettily, and understood\r\nhim so ill.' The conversation next turned on politics, and Goethe\r\nreverted to his favourite theory that if every man laboured\r\nfaithfully, honestly, and lovingly in this sphere, were it great or\r\nsmall, universal well-being and happiness would not long be wanting,\r\nwhatever the form of government. The prince urged in reply that a\r\nconstitutional government was first necessary to call such a principle\r\ninto life, and adduced the example of England in support of his\r\nargument. 'Goethe immediately replied that the choice of the example\r\nwas not happy, for that in no country was selfishness more omnipotent;\r\nthat no people were perhaps essentially less humane in their political\r\nor their private relations; that salvation came, not from without, by\r\nmeans of forms of government, but from within, by the wise moderation\r\nand humble activity of each man in his own circle; and that this must\r\never be the chief source of human felicity, while it was the easiest\r\nand the simplest to attain.'\r\n\r\nThe prince seems always to have played the part of Jonah on board\r\nship, and on the occasion of his journey to England, he had a terrible\r\npassage of forty hours, from Rotterdam to the London Docks. As soon as\r\nhe could get his carriage, horses, and luggage clear of the customs,\r\nhe hastened to the Clarendon Hotel, where he had stayed during his\r\nfirst visit to London. Unlike the American, N. P. Willis, he had come\r\narmed with many prejudices against England and the English, few of\r\nwhich he succeeded in losing during the two years of his sojourn among\r\nus. In his first letter from London, dated October 5, 1826, he writes:\r\n'London is now so utterly dead to elegance and fashion that one hardly\r\nmeets a single equipage, and nothing remains of the _beau monde_\r\nbut a few ambassadors. The huge city is at the same time full of fog\r\nand dirt, and the macadamised streets are like well-worn roads. The\r\nold pavement has been torn up, and replaced by small pieces of\r\ngranite, the interstices between which are filled up with gravel; this\r\nrenders the riding more easy, and diminishes the noise, but on the\r\nother hand changes the town into a sort of quagmire.' The prince\r\ncomments favourably on the improvements that had recently been carried\r\nout by Nash the architect, more especially as regards Regent Street\r\nand Portland Place, and declares that the laying out of the Regent's\r\nPark is 'faultless,' particularly in the disposition of the water.\r\n\r\nThe comfort and luxury of English hotels, as well as of private\r\nhouses, is a subject on which the traveller frequently enlarges, and\r\nin this first letter he assures his Lucie that she would be delighted\r\nwith the extreme cleanliness of the interiors, the great convenience\r\nof the furniture, and the good manners of the serving-people, though\r\nhe admits that, for all that pertains to luxury, the tourist pays\r\nabout six times as much as in Germany. 'The comfort of the inns,' he\r\ncontinues, 'is unknown on the Continent; on your washing-table you\r\nfind, not one miserable water-bottle with a single earthenware jug and\r\nbasin, and a long strip of towel, but positive tubs of porcelain in\r\nwhich you may plunge half your body; taps which instantly supply you\r\nwith streams of water at pleasure; half-a-dozen wide towels, a large\r\nstanding mirror, foot-baths and other conveniences of the toilet, all\r\nof equal elegance.'\r\n\r\nThe prince took advantage of the dead season to explore the city and\r\nother unfashionable quarters of the town. He was delighted with the\r\nexcellent side-pavements, the splendid shops, the brilliant gas-lamps,\r\nand above all (like Miss Edgeworth's Rosamund) with 'the great glass\r\nglobes in the chemists' windows, filled with liquid of a deep red,\r\nblue or green, the light of which is visible for miles(!)' Visits to\r\nthe Exchange, the Bank, and the Guildhall were followed by a call on\r\nRothschild, 'the Grand Ally of the Grand Alliance,' at his house of\r\nbusiness. 'On my presenting my card,' says our hero, 'he remarked\r\nironically that we were lucky people who could afford to travel about,\r\nand take our pleasure, while he, poor man, had such a heavy burden to\r\nbear. He then broke out into bitter complaints that every poor devil\r\nwho came to England had something to ask of him.... After this the\r\nconversation took a political turn, and we of course agreed that\r\nEurope could not subsist without him; he modestly declined our\r\ncompliments, and said, smiling, 'Oh no, you are only jesting; I am but\r\na servant, with whom people are pleased because he manages their\r\naffairs well, and to whom they allow some crumbs to fall as an\r\nacknowledgment.'\r\n\r\nOn October 19 the prince went to Newmarket for the races. During his\r\nstay he was introduced to a rich merchant of the neighbourhood, who\r\ninvited him to spend a couple of days at his country-house. He gives\r\nLucie a minute account of the manners and customs of an English\r\n_ménage_, but these are only interesting to the modern reader in\r\nso far as they have become obsolete. For example: 'When you enter the\r\ndining-room, you find the whole of the first course on the table, as\r\nin France. After the soup is removed, and the covers are taken off,\r\nevery man helps the dish before him, and offers some to his neighbour;\r\nif he wishes for anything else, he must ask across the table, or send\r\na servant for it, a very troublesome custom.... It is not usual to\r\ntake wine without drinking to another person. If the company is small,\r\nand a man has drunk with everybody, but happens to wish for more wine,\r\nhe must wait for the dessert, if he does not find in himself courage\r\nto brave custom.'\r\n\r\nOn his return to town the prince, who had been elected a member of the\r\nTravellers' Club, gives a long dissertation on English club life, not\r\nforgetting to dwell on the luxury of all the arrangements, the\r\nexcellent service, and the methodical fashion in which the\r\ngaming-tables were conducted. 'In no other country,' he declares, 'are\r\nwhat are here emphatically called \"business habits\" carried so\r\nextensively into social and domestic life; the value of time, of\r\norder, of despatch, of routine, are nowhere so well understood. This\r\nis the great key to the most striking, national characteristics. The\r\nquantity of material objects produced and accomplished--_the work\r\ndone_--in England exceeds all that man ever effected. The causes\r\nthat have produced these results have as certainly given birth to the\r\ndulness, the contracted views, the inveterate prejudices, the\r\nunbounded desire for, and deference to wealth which characterise the\r\ngreat mass of Englishmen.'\r\n\r\nDuring this first winter in London the prince was a regular attendant\r\nat the theatres, and many were the dramatic criticisms that he sent to\r\nhis 'friend' at Muskau. He saw Liston in the hundred and second\r\nrepresentation of Paul Pry, and at Drury Lane found, to his amazement\r\nthat Braham, whom he remembered as an elderly man in 1814, was still\r\nfirst favourite. 'He is the genuine representative of the English\r\nstyle of singing,' writes our critic, 'and in popular songs is the\r\nadored idol of the public. One cannot deny him great power of voice\r\nand rapidity of execution, but a more abominable style it is difficult\r\nto conceive.... The most striking feature to a foreigner in English\r\ntheatres is the natural coarseness and brutality of the audiences. The\r\nconsequence is that the higher and more civilised classes go only to\r\nthe Italian Opera, and very rarely visit their national theatre.\r\nEnglish freedom has degenerated into the rudest licence, and it is not\r\nuncommon in the midst of the most affecting part of a tragedy, or the\r\nmost charming cadenza of a singer, to hear some coarse expression\r\nshouted from the gallery in a stentor voice. This is followed, either\r\nby loud laughter and applause, or by the castigation and expulsion of\r\nthe offender.'\r\n\r\nThe poor prince saw Mozart's _Figaro_ announced for performance\r\nat Drury Lane, and looked forward to hearing once more the sweet\r\nharmonies of his Vaterland. 'What, then, was my astonishment,' he\r\nexclaims, in justifiable indignation, 'at the unheard-of treatment\r\nwhich the masterpiece of the immortal composer has received at English\r\nhands! You will hardly believe me when I tell you that neither the\r\ncount, the countess, nor Figaro sang; these parts were given to mere\r\nactors, and their principal airs were sung by other singers. To add to\r\nthis the gardener roared out some interpolated English popular songs,\r\nwhich suited Mozart's music just as a pitch-plaster would suit the\r\nface of the Venus de' Medici. The whole opera was, moreover, arranged\r\nby a certain Mr. Bishop; that is, adapted to English ears by means of\r\nthe most tasteless and shocking alterations. The English national\r\nmusic, the coarse, heavy melodies of which can never be mistaken for\r\nan instant, has to me, at least, something singularly offensive, an\r\nexpression of brutal feeling both in pain and pleasure that smacks of\r\n\"roast-beef, plum-pudding, and porter.\"'\r\n\r\nAnother entertainment attended by our hero about this time was the\r\nopening of Parliament by George IV., who had not performed this\r\nceremony for several years. 'The king,' we are told, 'looked pale and\r\nbloated, and was obliged to sit on the throne for a considerable time\r\nbefore he could get breath enough to read his speech. During this time\r\nhe turned friendly glances and condescending bows towards some\r\nfavoured ladies. On his right stood Lord Liverpool, with the sword of\r\nstate and the speech in his hand, and the Duke of Wellington on his\r\nleft. All three looked so miserable, so ashy-grey and worn out, that\r\nnever did human greatness appear to me so little worth.... In spite of\r\nhis feebleness, George IV. read his _banale_ speech with great\r\ndignity and a fine voice, but with that royal nonchalance which does\r\nnot concern itself with what his Majesty promises, or whether he is\r\nsometimes unable to decipher a word. It was very evident that the\r\nmonarch was heartily glad when the _corvée_ was over.'\r\n\r\nIn one of his early letters the traveller gives his friend the\r\nfollowing account of the manner in which he passes his day: 'I rise\r\nlate, read three or four newspapers at breakfast, look in my\r\nvisiting-book to see what visits I have to pay, and either drive to\r\npay them in my cabriolet, or ride. In the course of these excursions,\r\nI sometimes catch the enjoyment of the picturesque; the struggle of\r\nthe blood-red sun with the winter fogs often produces wild and\r\nsingular effects of light. After my visits I ride for several hours\r\nabout the beautiful environs of London, return when it grows dark,\r\ndress for dinner, which is at seven or eight, and spend the evening\r\neither at the theatre or some small party. The ludicrous routs--at\r\nwhich one hardly finds standing-room on the staircase--have not yet\r\ncommenced. In England, however, except in a few diplomatic houses, you\r\ncan go nowhere in the evening without a special invitation.'\r\n\r\nThe prince seems to have been bored at most of the parties he\r\nattended; partly, perhaps, out of pique at finding himself, so long\r\naccustomed to be the principal personage in his little kingdom of\r\nMuskau, eclipsed in influence and wealth by many a British commoner.\r\nFew persons that he met in the London of that day amused him more than\r\nthe great Rothschild, with whom he dined more than once at the\r\nbanker's suburban villa. Of one of these entertainments he writes:\r\n'Mr. Rothschild was in high good-humour, amusing and talkative. It was\r\ndiverting to hear him explain to us the pictures round his room (all\r\nportraits of the sovereigns of Europe, presented through their\r\nambassadors), and talk of the originals as his very good friends, and\r\nin a certain sense his equals. \"Yes,\" said he, \"the Prince of -----\r\nonce pressed me for a loan, and in the same week on which I received\r\nhis autograph letter, his father wrote to me also from Rome, to beg\r\nme, for Heaven's sake, not to have any concern in it, for that I could\r\nnot have to do with a more dishonest man than his son....\" He\r\nconcluded by modestly calling himself the dutiful and generously paid\r\nagent and servant of these high potentates, all of whom he honoured\r\nequally, let the state of politics be what it might; for, said he,\r\nlaughing, \"I never like to quarrel with my bread and butter.\" It shows\r\ngreat prudence in Mr. Rothschild to have accepted neither title nor\r\norder, and thus to have preserved a far more respectable independence.\r\nHe doubtless owes much to the good advice of his extremely amiable and\r\njudicious wife, who excels him in tact and knowledge of the world,\r\nthough not, perhaps, in acuteness and talents for business.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the prince had not as yet entered the ranks of authors, he\r\nwas always interested in meeting literary people, such as Mr. Hope,\r\nauthor of _Anastasius_, Mr. Morier of _Hadji Baba_ fame, and\r\nLady Charlotte Bury, who had exchanged the celebrity of a beauty for\r\nthat of a fashionable novelist. 'I called on Lady Charlotte,' he says,\r\n'the morning after meeting her, and found everything in her house\r\nbrown, in every possible shade; furniture, curtains, carpets, her own\r\nand her children's dresses, presented no other colour. The room was\r\nwithout looking-glasses or pictures, and its only ornaments were casts\r\nfrom the antique.... After I had been there some time, the celebrated\r\npublisher, Constable, entered. This man has made a fortune by Walter\r\nScott's novels, though, as I was told, he refused his first and best,\r\n_Waverley_, and at last gave but a small sum for it. I hope the\r\ncharming Lady Charlotte had better cause to be satisfied with him.'\r\nTowards the end of December, his Highness's head-gardener, Rehde, a\r\nvery important functionary at Muskau, arrived in London to be\r\ninitiated into the mysteries of English landscape-gardening. Together\r\nthe two enthusiasts, master and man, made a tour of some of the\r\nprincipal show-places of England, including Stanmore Priory, Woburn\r\nAbbey, Cashiobury, Blenheim, Stowe, Eaton, Warwick, and Kenilworth,\r\nbesides many of lesser note. At the end of the excursion, which lasted\r\nthree weeks, the prince declared that even he was beginning to feel\r\nsatiated with the charms of English parks. On his return to London he\r\nwas invited to spend a few days with Lord Darnley at Cobham, and\r\nwrites thence some further impressions of English country-house life.\r\nHe was a little perturbed at being publicly reminded by his elderly\r\nhost that they had made each other's acquaintance thirty years before.\r\n\r\n'Now, as I was in frocks at the time he spoke of,' observes the\r\nprince, 'I was obliged to beg for a further explanation, though I\r\ncannot say I was much delighted at having my age so fully discussed\r\nbefore all the company, for you know I claim to look not more than\r\nthirty. However, I could not but admire Lord Darnley's memory. He\r\nrecollected every circumstance of his visit to my parents with the\r\nDuke of Portland, and recalled to me many a little forgotten\r\nincident.'\r\n\r\nThe _vie de château_ the traveller considered the most agreeable\r\nside of English life, by reason of its freedom, and the absence of\r\nthose wearisome ceremonies which in Germany oppressed both host and\r\nguests. The English custom of being always _en évidence_,\r\nhowever, occasioned him considerable surprise. 'Strangers,' he\r\nobserves, 'have generally only one room allotted to them, and\r\nEnglishmen seldom go into this room except to sleep, and to dress\r\ntwice a day, which, even without company, is always _de rigueur_;\r\nfor all meals are usually taken in public, and any one who wants to\r\nwrite does it in the library. There, also, those who wish to converse,\r\ngive each other _rendezvous_, to avoid the rest of the society.\r\nHere you have an opportunity of gossiping for hours with the young\r\nladies, who are always very literarily inclined. Many a marriage is\r\nthus concocted or destroyed between the _corpus juris_ on the one\r\nside, and Bouffler's works on the other, while fashionable novels, as\r\na sort of intermediate link, lie on the tables in the middle.\r\n\r\nEarly in February the prince paid a visit to Brighton, where he made\r\nthe acquaintance of Count D'Orsay, and was entertained by Mrs.\r\nFitzherbert. He gives a jaundiced account of two entertainments, a\r\npublic ball and a musical _soirée_, which he attended while at\r\nBrighton, declaring--probably with some truth--that the latter is one\r\nof the greatest trials to which a foreigner can be exposed in England.\r\n'Every mother,' he explains, 'who has grown-up daughters, for whom she\r\nhas had to pay large sums to the music-master, chooses to enjoy the\r\nsatisfaction of having the youthful talent admired. There is nothing,\r\ntherefore, but quavering and strumming right and left, so that one is\r\nreally overpowered and unhappy; and even if an Englishwoman has a\r\nnatural capacity for singing, she seldom acquires either style or\r\nscience. The men are much more agreeable _dilettanti_, for they\r\nat least give one the diversion of a comical farce. That a man should\r\nadvance to the piano with far greater confidence than a David, strike\r\nwith his forefinger the note which he thinks his song should begin\r\nwith, and then _entonner_ like a thunder-clap (generally a tone\r\nor two lower than the pitch), and sing through a long aria without an\r\naccompaniment of any kind, except the most wonderful distortions of\r\nface, is a thing one must have seen to believe it possible, especially\r\nin the presence of at least fifty people.'\r\n\r\nBy the middle of April the season had begun in town, and the prince\r\nsoon found himself up to the eyes in invitations for balls, dinners,\r\nbreakfasts, and _soirées_. We hear of him dining with the Duke of\r\nClarence, to meet the Duchess of Kent and her daughter; assisting at\r\nthe Lord Mayor's banquet, which lasted six hours, and at which the\r\nchief magistrate made six-and-twenty speeches, long and short;\r\nbreakfasting with the Duke of Devonshire at Chiswick, being nearly\r\nsuffocated at the routs of Lady Cowper and Lady Jersey, and attending\r\nhis first ball at Almack's, in which famous assemblage his\r\nexpectations were woefully disappointed. 'A large, bare room,' so runs\r\nhis description, 'with a bad floor, and ropes round it, like the space\r\nin an Arab camp parted off for horses; two or three badly-furnished\r\nrooms at the side, in which the most wretched refreshments are served,\r\nand a company into which, in spite of all the immense difficulty of\r\ngetting tickets, a great many nobodies had wriggled; in which the\r\ndress was as tasteless as the _tournure_ was bad--this was all.\r\nIn a word, a sort of inn-entertainment--the music and lighting the\r\nonly good things. And yet Almack's is the culminating point of the\r\nEnglish world of fashion.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his readers, the prince was rather an observer than\r\nan auditor; for he describes what he sees vividly enough, but seldom\r\ntakes the trouble to set down the conversation that he hears. Perhaps\r\nhe thought it hardly worth recording, for he complains that in England\r\npolitics had become the main ingredient in social intercourse, that\r\nthe lighter and more frivolous pleasures suffered by the change, and\r\nthat the art of conversation would soon be entirely lost. 'In this\r\ncountry,' he unkindly adds, 'I should think it [the art of\r\nconversation] never existed, unless, perhaps, in Charles II.'s time.\r\nAnd, indeed, people here are too slavishly subject to established\r\nusages, too systematic in all their enjoyments, too incredibly kneaded\r\nup with prejudices; in a word, too little vivacious to attain to that\r\nunfettered spring and freedom of spirit, which must ever be the sole\r\nbasis of agreeable society. I must confess that I know none more\r\nmonotonous, nor more persuaded of its own pre-eminence than the\r\nhighest society of this country. A stony, marble-cold spirit of caste\r\nand fashion rules all classes, and makes the highest tedious, the\r\nlowest ridiculous.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of his dislike to politics as a subject of conversation, his\r\nHighness attended debates at the House of Lords and the House of\r\nCommons, and was so keenly interested in what he heard that he\r\ndeclared the hours passed like minutes. Canning had just been\r\nintrusted by George IV. with the task of forming a government, but had\r\npromptly been deserted by six members of the former Ministry,\r\nincluding Wellington, Lord Eldon, and Peel, who were now accused of\r\nhaving resigned in consequence of a cabal or conspiracy against the\r\nconstitutional prerogative of the king to change his ministers at his\r\nown pleasure. In the House of Commons the prince heard Peel's attack\r\non Canning and the new government, which was parried by Brougham. 'In\r\na magnificent speech, which flowed on like a clear stream, Brougham,'\r\nwe are told, 'tried to disarm his opponent; now tortured him with\r\nsarcasms; now wrought upon the sensibility, or convinced the reason,\r\nof his hearers. The orator closed with the solemn declaration that he\r\nwas perfectly impartial; that he _could_ be impartial, because it\r\nwas his fixed determination never, and on no terms, to accept a place\r\nin the administration of the kingdom.... [Footnote: In 1831 Brougham\r\naccepted office as Lord Chancellor.] Canning, the hero of the day, now\r\nrose. If his predecessor might be compared to a dexterous and elegant\r\nboxer, Canning presented the image of a finished antique gladiator.\r\nAll was noble, simple, refined; then suddenly his eloquence burst\r\nforth like lightning-grand and all-subduing. His speech was, from\r\nevery point of view, the most complete, as well as the most\r\nirresistibly persuasive--the crown and glory of the debate.'\r\n\r\nOn the following day the prince heard some of the late ministers on\r\ntheir defence in the House of Lords. 'Here,' he observes, 'I saw the\r\ngreat Wellington in terrible straits. He is no orator, and was obliged\r\nto enter upon his defence like an accused person. He was considerably\r\nagitated; and this senate of his country, though composed of men whom\r\nindividually, perhaps, he did not care for, appeared more imposing to\r\nhim _en masse_ than Napoleon and his hundred thousands. He\r\nstammered much, interrupted and involved himself, but at length he\r\nbrought the matter tolerably to this conclusion, that there was no\r\n\"conspiracy.\" He occasionally said strong things--probably stronger\r\nthan he meant, for he was evidently not master of his material. Among\r\nother things, the following words pleased me extremely: \"I am a\r\nsoldier and no orator. I am utterly deficient in the talents requisite\r\nto play a part in this great assembly. I must be more than insane if I\r\never entertained the thought, of which I am accused, of becoming Prime\r\nMinister.\"... [Footnote: In January 1828 the duke became Prime\r\nMinister.] When I question myself as to the total impression of this\r\nday, I must confess that it was at once elevating and melancholy--the\r\nformer when I fancied myself an Englishman, the latter when I felt\r\nmyself a German. This twofold senate of the people of England, in\r\nspite of all the defects and blemishes common to human institutions,\r\nis yet grand in the highest degree; and in contemplating its power and\r\noperation thus near at hand, one begins to understand why it is that\r\nthe English nation is, as yet, the first on the face of the earth.'\r\n\r\nThe traveller was by no means exclusively occupied in hearing and\r\nseeing new things. With that strain of practicality which contrasted\r\nso oddly with his sentimental and romantic temperament, he kept firmly\r\nbefore his eyes the main object of his visit to England. He had\r\ndetermined at the outset not to sell himself and his title for less\r\nthan £50,000, but he confesses that, as time passed on, his demands\r\nbecame much more modest. His matrimonial ventures were all faithfully\r\ndetailed to the presumably sympathising Lucie, for whose sake, the\r\nprince persuaded himself, he was far more anxious for success than for\r\nhis own. But he had not counted on the many obstacles with which he\r\nfound himself confronted, chief among them being his relations with\r\nhis former wife. It was known that the ex-princess was still living at\r\nMuskau with all the rights and privileges of a _chátelaine_,\r\nwhile the prince never disguised his attachment to her, and openly\r\nkept her portrait on his table. English mothers who would have\r\nwelcomed him as a son-in-law were led to believe that the divorce was\r\nonly a blind, and that the prince's marriage would be actually, if not\r\nlegally, a bigamous union. The satirical papers represented him as a\r\nfortune-hunter, a Bluebeard who had ill-treated his first wife, and\r\ndeclared that he had proposed for the hand of the dusky Empress of\r\nHayti, then on a visit to Europe.\r\n\r\nStill our hero obstinately pursued his quest, laying siege to the\r\nheart of every presentable-looking heiress to whom he was introduced,\r\nand if attention to the art of the toilet could have gained him a rich\r\nbride, he would not long have been unsuccessful. In dress he took the\r\ngenuine interest and delight of the dandy of the period, and\r\nmarvellous are the descriptions of his costume that he sends to Lucie.\r\nFor morning visits, of which he sometimes paid fifty in one day, he\r\nwore his hair dyed a beautiful black, a new hat, a green neckerchief\r\nwith gaily coloured stripes, a yellow cashmere waistcoat with metal\r\nbuttons, an olive-green frock-coat and iron-grey pantaloons. On other\r\noccasions he is attired in a dark-brown coat, with a velvet collar, a\r\nwhite neckerchief, in which a thin gold watch-chain is entwined, a\r\nwaistcoat with a collar of _cramoisie_ and gold stars, an\r\nunder-waistcoat of white satin, embroidered with gold flowers, full\r\nblack pantaloons, spun silk stockings, and short square shoes. Style\r\nsuch as this could only be maintained at a vast outlay, from the\r\nGerman point of view, the week's washing-bill alone amounting to an\r\nimportant sum. According to the prince's calculation, a London\r\nexquisite, during the season of 1827, required every week twenty\r\nshirts, twenty-four pocket-handkerchiefs, nine or ten pairs of summer\r\ntrousers, thirty neckerchiefs, a dozen waistcoats and stockings _à\r\ndiscértion_. 'I see your housewifely ears aghast, my good Lucie,'\r\nhe writes, 'but as a dandy cannot get on without dressing three or\r\nfour times a day, the affair is quite simple.'\r\n\r\nHowever much the prince may have enjoyed the ceremony of the toilet,\r\nhe strongly objected to the process of hair-dyeing, and his letters\r\nare full of complaints of his sufferings and humiliation while\r\nundergoing the operation, which, he declares, is a form of slow\r\npoison, and also an unpleasant reminder that he is really old, but\r\nobliged to play the part of youth in order to attain an object that\r\nmay bring him more misery than happiness. As soon as he is safely\r\nmarried to his heiress, he expresses his determination of looking his\r\nfull age, so that people might say 'What a well-preserved old man!'\r\ninstead of '_Voilà, le ci-devant jeune homme_!' Still, with all\r\nthis care and thought, heiresses remained coy, or more probably their\r\nparents were 'difficult.' The prince's highly-developed personal\r\nvanity was wounded by many a refusal, and so weary did he become of\r\nthis woman-hunt, that in one letter to Lucie, dated March 5, 1827, he\r\nexclaims, 'Ah, my dearest, if you only had 150,000 thalers, I would\r\nmarry you again to-morrow!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer months were spent in visits to Windsor and other parks near\r\nLondon, and in a tour through Yorkshire. In October his Highness was\r\nback in town, and engaged in a new matrimonial venture. He writes to\r\nLucie that 'the fortune in question is immense, and if I obtain it, I\r\nshall end gloriously.' In the correspondence published after the\r\nprince's death is the draft of a letter to Mr. Bonham of Titness Park,\r\ncontaining a formal proposal for the hand of his daughter, 'Miss\r\nHarriet,' and detailing (with considerable reservations) the position\r\nof his financial affairs. Muskau, he explains, is worth £4,000 a year,\r\nan income which in Germany is equivalent to three times as much in\r\nEngland. 'Everything belonging to me,' he continues, 'is in the best\r\npossible order; a noble residence at Muskau, and two smaller chateaux,\r\nsurrounded with large parks and gardens, in fact, all that make enjoy\r\nlife (sic) in the country is amply provided for, and a numerous train\r\nof officious (sic) of my household are always ready to receive their\r\nyoung princess at her own seat, or if she should prefer town, the\r\ncourt of Prussia will offer her every satisfaction.' Owing to the fact\r\nthat Muskau was mortgaged for £50,000, he was forced, he confesses, to\r\nexpect an adequate fortune with his wife, a circumstance to which, if\r\nhe had been otherwise situated, he should have paid little attention.\r\n\r\nThis missive was accompanied by a long letter, dated Nov. 1, 1827, to\r\n'Miss Harriet,' in which the suitor explains the circumstances of his\r\nformer marriage, and of his divorce, the knowledge of which has\r\nrendered her uneasy. 'It is rather singular,' he proceeds, 'that in\r\nthe very first days after my arrival, you, Miss Harriet, were named to\r\nme, together with some other young ladies, as heiresses. Now I must\r\nconfess, at the risk of the fact being doubted in our industrious\r\ntimes, that I myself had a prejudice against, and even some dread of\r\nheiresses. I may say that I proved in some way these feelings to exist\r\nby marrying a lady with a very small fortune, and afterwards in\r\nEngland by never courting any heiresses further as common civility\r\nrequired. My reasons for so doing are not without foundation. In the\r\nfirst instance, I am a little proud; in the second, I don't want any\r\nmore than I possess, though I should not reject it, finding it in my\r\nway, and besides all this, rich young maidens are not always very\r\namiable.' The prince continues that he had gone, out of principle,\r\ninto all kinds of society, and seen many charming and handsome girls,\r\nbut had not been able to discover his affinity. At last, after\r\nrenouncing the idea of marriage, he heard again of Miss Harriet\r\nBonham, not of her fortune this time, but of her many excellent\r\nqualities, and the fact that she had refused several splendid offers.\r\nHis curiosity was now at last aroused; he sought an opportunity of\r\nbeing introduced to her, and--'Dearest Miss Harriet, you know the\r\nrest. I thought--and I protest it by all that is sacred--I thought\r\nwhen I left you again, that here at last I had found united all and\r\neverything I could wish in a future companion through life. An\r\nexterior the most pleasing, a mind and person equally fit for the\r\nrepresentation of a court and the delight of a cottage, and above all,\r\nthat sensibility, that goodness of heart, and that perfect absence of\r\nconceitedness which I value more than every other accomplishment.... I\r\nbeheld you, besides all your more essential qualities, so quick as\r\nlively, so playful as whitty (_sic_), and nothing really seemed\r\nmore bewitching to me as when a hearty, joyful laugh changed your\r\nthoughtful, noble features to the cheerful appearance of a happy\r\nchild! And still through every change your and your friends'\r\nconversation and behaviour always remained distinguished by that\r\nperfect breeding and fine tact which, indeed, is to private life what\r\na clear sky is to a landscape....'\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal mere to the same effect, and it is sad to think\r\nthat all this trouble, all this expenditure of ink and English\r\ngrammar, was thrown away. Papa Bonham could not pay down the fortune\r\ndemanded by the prince without injuring the other members of his\r\nfamily; [Footnote: Mr. Bonham's eldest daughter was the second wife of\r\nthe first Lord Garvagh.] and although Miss Harriet deplores 'the cruel\r\nend of all our hopes,' the negotiations fell through.\r\n\r\nThe prince consoled himself for his disappointment with a fresh round\r\nof sight-seeing. He became deeply enamoured of a steam-engine, of\r\nwhich newly-invented animal he sends the following picturesque\r\ndescription to Lucie: 'We must now be living in the days of\r\nthe _Arabian Nights_, for I have seen a creature to-day far\r\nsurpassing all the fantastic beings of that time. Listen to the\r\nmonster's characteristics. In the first place, its food is the\r\ncheapest possible, for it eats nothing but wood or coals, and when not\r\nactually at work, it requires none. It never sleeps, nor is weary; it\r\nis subject to no diseases, if well organised at first; and never\r\nrefuses its work till worn out by great length of service. It is\r\nequally active in all climates, and undertakes all kinds of labour\r\nwithout a murmur. Here it is a miner, there a sailor, a\r\ncotton-spinner, a weaver, or a miller; and though a small creature, it\r\ndraws ninety tons of goods, or a whole regiment of soldiers, with a\r\nswiftness exceeding that of the fleetest mail-coaches. At the same\r\ntime, it marks its own measured steps on a tablet fixed in front of\r\nit. It regulates, too, the degree of warmth necessary to its\r\nwell-being; it has a strange power of oiling its inmost joints when\r\nthey are stiff, and of removing at pleasure all injurious air that\r\nmight find the way into its system; but should anything become\r\nderanged in it, it warns its master by the loud ringing of a bell.\r\nLastly, it is so docile, in spite of its enormous strength (nearly\r\nequal to that of six hundred horses), that a child of four years old\r\nis able in a moment to arrest its mighty labours by the pressure of\r\nhis little finger. Did ever a witch burnt for sorcery produce its\r\nequal?'\r\n\r\nA few weeks later we hear of one manifestation of the new power, which\r\ndid not quite come up to the expectations of its admirers. On January\r\n16, 1828, the prince writes: 'The new steam-carriage is completed, and\r\ngoes five miles in half an hour on trial in the Regent's Park. But\r\nthere was something to repair every moment. I was one of the first of\r\nthe curious who tried it; but found the smell of oiled iron, which\r\nmakes steamboats so unpleasant, far more insufferable here. Stranger\r\nstill is another vehicle to which I yesterday intrusted my person. It\r\nis nothing less than a carriage drawn by a paper kite, very like those\r\nthe children fly. This is the invention of a schoolmaster, who is so\r\nskilful in the guidance of his vehicle, that he can get on very fairly\r\nwith half a wind, but with a completely fair one, and good roads, he\r\ngoes a mile in three-quarters of a minute. The inventor proposes to\r\ntraverse the African deserts in this manner, and has contrived a place\r\nbehind, in which a pony stands like a footman, and in case of a calm,\r\ncan he harnessed to the carriage.'\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1828 Henriette Sontag arrived in London, and the\r\nprince at once fell a victim to her charms. The fascinating singer,\r\nthen barely three-and-twenty, was already the idol of the public, at\r\nthe very summit of her renown. Amazing prices were paid for seats when\r\nshe was announced to appear. Among his Highness's papers was found a\r\nticket for a box at the opera on 'Madame Sontag's night,' on which he\r\nnotes that he had sold a diamond clasp to pay the eighty guineas\r\ndemanded for the bit of cardboard. He was in love once again with all\r\nthe ardour of youth, and for the moment all thoughts of a marriage of\r\nconvenience were dismissed from his mind. He was now eager for a\r\nlove-match with the fair Henriette, whose attractions had rendered him\r\ntemporarily forgetful of those of Muskau. But Mademoiselle Sontag,\r\nthough carried away by the passionate wooing of the prince, actually\r\nremembered that she had other ties, probably her engagement to Rossi,\r\nto which it was her duty to remain true. She told her lover that he\r\nmust learn to forget her, and that when they parted at the conclusion\r\nof the London season, they must never meet again. The prince was\r\nheart-broken at the necessity for separation, and we are assured that\r\nhe never forgot Henriette Sontag (though she had many successors in\r\nhis affections), and that after his return to Germany he placed a\r\ngilded bust of the singer in his park, in order that he might have her\r\nimage ever before his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of distracting his thoughts from his disappointment,\r\nPrince Pückler decided to make a lengthened tour through Wales and\r\nIreland, and with this object in view he set out in July 1828. Before\r\nhis departure, however, he had an interesting rencontre at a\r\ndinner-party given by the Duchess of St. Albans-the _ci-devant_\r\nHarriet Melton. 'I arrived late,' says the prince, in his account of\r\nthe incident, 'and was placed between my hostess and a tall, very\r\nsimple, but benevolent-looking man of middle age, who spoke broad\r\nScotch--a dialect anything but agreeable; and would probably have\r\nstruck me by nothing else, if I had not discovered that I was sitting\r\nnext to ----, the Great Unknown! It was not long ere many a sally of\r\ndry, poignant wit fell from his lips, and many an anecdote told in the\r\nmost unpretending manner. His eye, too, glanced whenever he was\r\nanimated, with such a clear, good-natured lustre, and such an\r\nexpression of true-hearted kindness, that it was impossible not to\r\nconceive a sort of affection for him. Towards the end of the dinner he\r\nand Sir Francis Burdett told ghost-stories, half terrible, half\r\nhumorous, one against the other.... A little concert concluded the\r\nevening, in which the very pretty daughter of the great bard--a\r\nhealthy-looking Highland beauty--took part, and Miss Stephens sang\r\nnothing but Scottish ballads.'\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon a new field of observation, the prince summed up\r\nhis general impressions of London society with a candour that cannot\r\nhave been very agreeable to his English readers. The goddess of\r\nFashion, he observes, reigns in England alone with a despotic and\r\ninexorable sway; while the spirit of caste here receives a power,\r\nconsistency, and completeness of development unexampled in any other\r\ncountry. 'Every class of society in England, as well as every field,\r\nis separated from every other by a hedge of thorns. Each has its own\r\nmanners and turns of expression, and, above all, a supreme and\r\nabsolute contempt for all below it.... Now although the aristocracy\r\ndoes not stand _as such_ upon the pinnacle of this strange social\r\nedifice, it yet exercises great influence over it. It is, indeed,\r\ndifficult to become fashionable without being of good descent; but it\r\nby no means follows that a man is so in virtue of being\r\nwell-born--still less of being rich. Ludicrous as it may sound, it is\r\na fact that while the present king is a very fashionable man, his\r\nfather was not so in the smallest degree, and that none of his\r\nbrothers have any pretensions to fashion; which unquestionably is\r\nhighly to their honour.' The truth of this observation is borne out by\r\nthe story of Beau Brummell, who, when offended by some action of the\r\nRegent's, exclaimed, 'If this sort of thing goes on, I shall cut\r\nWales, and bring old George into fashion!'\r\n\r\n'A London exclusive of the present day,' continues our censor, 'is\r\nnothing more than a bad, flat, dull imitation of a French _roué_\r\nof the Regency, Both have in common selfishness, levity, boundless\r\nvanity, and an utter want of heart. But what a contrast if we look\r\nfurther! In France the absence of all morality and honesty was in some\r\ndegree atoned for by the most refined courtesy, the poverty of soul by\r\nagreeableness and wit. What of all this has the English dandy to\r\noffer? His highest triumph is to appear with the most wooden manners,\r\nas little polished as will suffice to avoid castigation; nay, to\r\ncontrive even his civilities so that they are as near as may be to\r\naffronts--this is the style of deportment that confers on him the\r\ngreatest celebrity. Instead of a noble, high-bred ease, to have the\r\ncourage to offend against every restraint of decorum; to invert the\r\nrelation in which his sex stands to women, so that they appear the\r\nattacking, and he the passive or defensive party; to cut his best\r\nfriends if they cease to have the strength and authority of fashion;\r\nto delight in the ineffably _fade_ jargon and affectations of his\r\nset, and always to know what is \"the thing\"--these are the\r\naccomplishments that distinguish a young \"lion\" of fashion. Whoever\r\nreads the best of the recent English novels--those by the author of\r\n_Pelham_--may be able to abstract from them a tolerably just idea\r\nof English fashionable society, provided he does not forget to deduct\r\nqualities which the national self-love has erroneously claimed\r\n--namely, grace for its _roués_, seductive manners and witty\r\nconversation for its dandies.'\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a summary of the prince's lengthy indictment against\r\nLondon society. 'I saw in the fashionable world,' he observes in\r\nconclusion, 'only too frequently, and with few exceptions, a profound\r\nvulgarity of thought; an immorality little veiled or adorned; the most\r\nundisguised arrogance; and the coarsest neglect of all kindly feelings\r\nand attentions haughtily assumed for the sake of shining in a false\r\nand despicable refinement; even more inane and intolerable to a\r\nhealthy mind than the awkward stiffness of the declared Nobodies. It\r\nhas been said that vice and poverty form the most revolting\r\ncombination; since I have been in England, vice and boorish rudeness\r\nseem to me to form a still more disgusting union.'\r\n\r\nThe prince's adventures in Wales and Ireland, with the recital of\r\nwhich he has filled up the best part of two volumes, must here be\r\ndismissed in as many paragraphs. On his tour through Wales, he left\r\nhis card on the Ladies of Llangollen, who promptly invited him to\r\nlunch. Fortunately, he had previously been warned of his hostesses'\r\npeculiarities of dress and appearance. 'Imagine,' he writes, 'two\r\nladies, the elder of whom, Lady Eleanor Butler, a short, robust woman,\r\nbegins to feel her years a little, being nearly eighty-three; the\r\nother, a tall and imposing person, esteems herself still youthful,\r\nbeing only seventy-four. Both wore their still abundant hair combed\r\nstraight back and powdered, a round man's hat, a man's cravat and\r\nwaistcoat, but in the place of \"inexpressibles,\" a short petticoat and\r\nboots: the whole covered by a coat of blue cloth, of quite a peculiar\r\ncut. Over this Lady Eleanor wore, first the grand cordon of the order\r\nof St. Louis across her shoulders; secondly, the same order round her\r\nneck; thirdly, the small cross of the same in her buttonhole; and,\r\n_pour comble de gloire_, a golden lily of nearly the natural size\r\nas a star. So far the effect was somewhat ludicrous. But now you must\r\nimagine both ladies with that agreeable _aisance_, that air of\r\nthe world of the _ancien régime_, courteous, entertaining,\r\nwithout the slightest affectation, speaking French as well as any\r\nEnglishwoman of my acquaintance; and, above all, with that essentially\r\npolite, unconstrained, simply cheerful manner of the good society of\r\nthat day, which in our hard-working, business age appears to be going\r\nto utter decay.'\r\n\r\nThanks to his letters of introduction and the friendships that he\r\nstruck up on the road, the prince was able occasionally to step out of\r\nthe beaten tourist tracks, and to see something of the more intimate\r\nside of Irish social life. He has given a lively and picturesque\r\naccount of his experiences, which included an introduction to Lady\r\nMorgan, [Footnote: See page 142.] and to her charming nieces, the Miss\r\nClarkes (who made a profound impression on his susceptible heart), a\r\nsentimental journey through Wicklow, a glance at the humours of\r\nDonnybrook Fair, a visit to O'Connell at Derrinane Abbey, a peep into\r\nthe wilds of Connaught, an Emancipation dinner at Cashel, where he\r\nmade his _début_ as an English orator, and an expedition to the\r\nlakes of Killarney. All this, which was probably novel and interesting\r\nto the German public, contains little that is not familiar to the\r\nmodern English reader. The sketch of O'Connell is sufficiently vivid\r\nto bear quotation.\r\n\r\n'Daniel O'Connell,' observes the prince, after his visit to Derrinane,\r\n'is no common man--though the man of the commonalty. His power is so\r\ngreat that at this moment it only depends on him to raise the standard\r\nof rebellion from one end of the island to the other. He is, however,\r\ntoo sharp-sighted, and much too sure of attaining his ends by safer\r\nmeans, to wish to bring on any such violent crisis. He has certainly\r\nshown great dexterity in availing himself of the temper of the country\r\nat this moment, legally, openly, and in the face of Government, to\r\nacquire a power scarcely inferior to that of the sovereign; indeed,\r\nthough without arms or armies, in some instances far surpassing it.\r\nFor how would it have been possible for his Majesty George IV. to\r\nwithhold 40,000 of his faithful Irishmen for three days from whisky\r\ndrinking? which O'Connell actually accomplished in the memorable Clare\r\nelection. The enthusiasm of the people rose to such a height that they\r\nthemselves decreed and inflicted a punishment for drunkenness. The\r\ndelinquent was thrown into the river, and held there for two hours,\r\nduring which time he was made to undergo frequent submersions.... On\r\nthe whole, O'Connell exceeded my expectations. His exterior is\r\nattractive, and the expression of intelligent good-humour, united with\r\ndetermination and prudence, which marks his countenance, is extremely\r\nwinning. He has perhaps more of persuasiveness than of large and lofty\r\neloquence; and one frequently perceives too much design and manner in\r\nhis words. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to follow his powerful\r\narguments with interest, to view the martial dignity of his carriage\r\nwithout pleasure, or to refrain from laughing at his wit.... He has\r\nreceived from Nature an invaluable gift for a party-leader, a\r\nmagnificent voice, united to good lungs and a strong constitution. His\r\nunderstanding is sharp and quick, and his acquirements out of his\r\nprofession not inconsiderable. With all this his manners are, as I\r\nhave said, winning and popular, though somewhat of the actor is\r\nnoticeable in them; they do not conceal his very high opinion of\r\nhimself, and are occasionally tinged by what an Englishman would call\r\n_vulgarity_. But where is there a picture without shade?'\r\n\r\nThe prince's matrimonial projects had been pursued only in\r\nhalf-hearted fashion during this year, and on his return to England in\r\nDecember, he seems to have thrown up the game in despair. On January\r\n2, 1829, he turned his back on our perfidious shores, and made a short\r\ntour in France before proceeding to Muskau. In one of his letters to\r\nLucie he admits that on his return journey he had plenty of material\r\nfor reflection. Two precious years had been wasted, absence from his\r\ndearest friend had been endured, a large sum of money had been spent\r\nin keeping up a dashing appearance--and all in vain. He consoles\r\nhimself with the amazing reflection that Parry had failed in three\r\nattempts to reach the North Pole, and Bonaparte, after heaping victory\r\non victory for twenty years, had perished miserably in St. Helena!\r\n\r\nBut if the prince had not accomplished his design of carrying off a\r\nBritish heiress, his sojourn in England brought him a prize of a\r\ndifferent kind--namely, the laurel crown of fame. His _Briefe eines\r\nVerstorbenen_, the first volumes of which were published\r\nanonymously in 1830, was greeted with an almost unanimous outburst of\r\nadmiration and applause. The critics vied with each other in praising\r\na work in which, according to their verdict, the grace and piquancy of\r\nFrance were combined with the analytical methods and the profound\r\nphilosophy of Germany. In England, as was only to be expected, the\r\nchorus of applause was not unmixed with hisses and catcalls. The\r\nauthor had, however, been exceptionally fortunate in his translator,\r\nSarah Austin, whose version of the Letters, entitled _The Tour of a\r\nGerman Prince_, was described by the _Westminster Review_ as\r\n'the best modern translation of a prose work that has ever appeared,\r\nand perhaps our only translation from the German. As an original work,\r\nthe ease and facility of the style would be admired; as a translation,\r\nit is unrivalled.' Croker reviewed the book in the _Quarterly_ in\r\nhis accustomed strain of playful brutality, rejoiced savagely over the\r\nnumerous blunders, [Footnote: The most amusing of these is the\r\nderivation of the Prince of Wales' motto 'Ich dien' from two Welsh\r\nwords, 'Eich deyn,' said to signify 'This is your man!'] and credited\r\nthe author with almost as many blasphemies as Lady Morgan herself. The\r\n_Edinburgh_, in a more impartial notice, observed that a great\r\npart of the work had no other merit than that of being an act of\r\nindividual treachery against the hospitalities of private life, and\r\ncommented on the fact that while the masterpieces of Goethe\r\nand Schiller were still untranslated, the _Tour of Prince\r\nPückler-Muskau_ had been bought up in a month.\r\n\r\nThe prince was far too vain of his unexpected literary success to\r\npreserve his anonymity, and the ink-craving having laid hold upon him,\r\nhe lost no time in setting to work upon another book. The semblance of\r\na separation between himself and Lucie had now been thrown aside.\r\nDuring the summer months they lived at Muskau, where they laboured\r\ntogether over plans for the embellishment of the gardens, while in the\r\nwinter they kept up a splendid establishment in Berlin. The sight of a\r\ndivorced couple living together seems to have shocked the Berliners\r\nfar more than that of a married couple living apart, but to Pückler,\r\nas a chartered 'original,' much was forgiven. At this time he went a\r\ngood deal into literary society, and became intimate with several\r\nwomen-writers, among them the Gräfin Hahn-Hahn, Rahel, and that\r\namazing lady, Bettine von Arnim. With the last-named he struck up an\r\nintellectual friendship which roused the jealousy of Lucie, and was\r\nfinally wrecked by Bettine's attempts to obtain a spiritual empire\r\nover the lord of Muskau.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the prince's debts amounted to 500,000 thalers, and he was\r\nobliged once again to face the fact that he could only save himself\r\nfrom ruin by a wealthy marriage, or by the sale of his estate. In a\r\nlong letter he laid the state of the case before his faithful\r\ncompanion, pointing out that even at forty-seven, he, with his title\r\nand his youthful appearance, might hope to secure a bride worth\r\n300,000 thalers, but that as long as his ex-wife remained at Muskau he\r\nwas hardly likely to be successful in his matrimonial speculations.\r\nLucie again consented to sacrifice herself in the good cause; but the\r\nprince, a man of innumerable _bonnes fortunes_ according to his\r\nown account, was curiously unfortunate as a would-be Benedick. The\r\nGerman heiresses were no more propitious to his suit than the English\r\nones had been; and though, as he plaintively observes, he would have\r\nliked nothing better than to be a Turkish pasha with a hundred and\r\nfifty sultanas, he was unable to obtain a single Christian wife.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the prince published two books, _Tutti Frutti_, a\r\ncollection of stories and sketches, and _Observations on\r\nLandscape-Gardening_. _Tutti Frutti_ was by no means so\r\npopular as the _Briefe eines Verstorbenen_, but the\r\n_Observations_ took rank as a standard work. The project of a\r\njourney to America having been abandoned, the prince now determined to\r\nspend the winter in Algiers, leaving Lucie in charge at Muskau. This\r\nmodest programme enlarged itself into a tour in the East, which lasted\r\nfor more than five years. The travellers adventures during this period\r\nhave been described in his _Semilasso in Africa, Aus Mehemet's\r\nReich, Die Rückkehr_, and other works, which added to their\r\nauthor's fame, and nearly sufficed to pay his expenses. We hear of him\r\nbreaking hearts at Tunis and Athens, shooting big game in the Soudan,\r\nastonishing the Arabs by his horsemanship, and meddling in Egyptian\r\npolitics. It was not until 1838 that, moved by Lucie's complaints of\r\nher loneliness, he reluctantly abandoned his plan of settling in the\r\nEast, and turned his face towards Europe. On the homeward journey he\r\nmade a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and turned out of his course for the\r\nvisit to Lady Hester Stanhope that has already been described.\r\n\r\nHis Highness arrived at Vienna in the autumn of 1839, bringing in his\r\nsuite an Abyssinian slave-girl, Machbuba, whom he had bought a couple\r\nof years before, and who had developed such wonderful qualities of\r\nhead and heart, that he could not bring himself to part from her. But\r\nLucie obstinately refused to receive Machbuba at Muskau, and declared\r\nthat the prince's reputation would be destroyed for ever, if he\r\nbrought a favourite slave under the same roof as his 'wife,' and thus\r\nsinned against the laws of outward seemliness. So Machbuba and the\r\nmaster who, like another Pygmalion, seems to have endowed this dusky\r\nGalatea with a mind and soul, remained at Vienna, where the\r\nAbyssinian, clad in a picturesque Mameluke's costume, accompanied the\r\nprince to all the public spectacles, and became a nine days' wonder to\r\nthe novelty-loving Viennese. But the severity of a European winter\r\nproved fatal to poor Machbuba, consumption laid its grip upon her, and\r\nit was as a dying girl that at last she was taken to the Baths of\r\nMuskau. Lucie received this once-dreaded rival kindly, but at once\r\ncarried off the prince for a visit to Berlin, and in the absence of\r\nthe master whom she worshipped with a spaniel-like devotion, Machbuba\r\nbreathed her last. The slave-girl was laid to rest amid all the pomp\r\nand ceremony of a state funeral, the principal inhabitants of Muskau\r\nand the neighbourhood followed her to her grave, and on the Sunday\r\nfollowing her death the chaplain delivered a eulogy on Machbuba's\r\nvirtues, and the fatherly benevolence of her master.\r\n\r\nThe prince was temporarily broken-hearted at the death of his\r\nfavourite, but his mercurial spirits soon reasserted themselves, and a\r\nround of visits to the various German courts restored him to his\r\naccustomed self-complacency. The idea of selling Muskau, and thus\r\nridding himself of the burden of his debts, once more occupied his\r\nmind. A handsome offer for the estate had been refused a few years\r\nbefore, in compliance with the wishes of Lucie, who loved Muskau even\r\nbetter than its master, and had appealed to the king to prevent the\r\nsale. But in 1845 came another offer from Count Hatzfeld of 1,700,000\r\nthalers, which, in spite of Lucie's tears and entreaties, the prince\r\ndecided to accept. Although it cost him a sharp pang to give up to\r\nanother the spot of earth on which he had lavished so much time, so\r\nmuch labour, and so much money, he fully appreciated the advantage of\r\nan unembarrassed income and complete freedom of movement.\r\n\r\nFor a year or two after the sale, he led a wandering life, with Berlin\r\nor Weimar for his headquarters. In 1846, shortly before his sixtieth\r\nbirthday, he met, so he confided to the long-suffering Lucie, the only\r\nwoman he had ever loved, or at least the only woman he had ever\r\ndesired to marry. Unfortunately, the lady, who was young, beautiful,\r\nclever, of high rank, large fortune, and angelic disposition, had been\r\nmarried for some years to a husband who is described as ugly,\r\nill-tempered, jealous, and incredibly selfish. The prince's letters at\r\nthis period are filled with raptures over the virtues of his new\r\n_inamorata_, and lamentations that he had met her too late. For\r\nthough his passion was returned the lady was a strict Catholic, for\r\nwhom a divorce was out of the question, and for once this hardened\r\nLothario shrank from an elopement, with the resultant stain upon the\r\nreputation of the woman he loved. In 1846 he parted from his affinity,\r\nwho survived the separation little more than a year, and retired with\r\na heavy heart to his paternal castle of Branitz, near Kottbus, where\r\nhe occupied himself in planting a park and laying out gardens. Branitz\r\nwas only about a tenth part the size of Muskau, and stood in the midst\r\nof a sandy waste, but at more than sixty years of age the prince set\r\nhimself, with all the ardour of youth, to conjure a paradise out of\r\nthe wilderness. Forest trees were transplanted, lakes and canals dug,\r\nhills appeared out of the level fields, and, in short, this\r\n'earth-tamer,' as Rahel called him, created not only a park, but a\r\ncomplete landscape.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our hero's eventful career must be briefly\r\nsummarised. In 1851 he made a flight to England to see the Great\r\nExhibition. Here he renewed his acquaintance with many old friends,\r\namong them the Duchess of Somerset, who told him that she had known\r\nhis father well twenty-five years before. The prince, who has been\r\ndescribed as a male Ninon de L'Enclos, was naturally delighted at\r\nbeing mistaken for his own son. In 1852 the work at Branitz was so far\r\nadvanced that its lord invited Lucie to come and take up her abode at\r\nthe Schloss. But the poor lady's troubled life was nearing its close.\r\nShe had a paralytic stroke in the autumn of this year, and remained an\r\ninvalid until her death, which took place at Branitz in May, 1854.\r\n\r\nIn the loneliness that followed, the prince amused himself by keeping\r\nup a lively correspondence with his feminine acquaintance, for whom,\r\neven at seventy, he had not lost his fascinations. His celebrity as an\r\nauthor and a traveller brought him many anonymous correspondents, and\r\nhe never wearied of reading and answering the sentimental effusions of\r\nhis unknown admirers. In 1863 he paid a visit incognito to Muskau, the\r\nfirst since he had left it eighteen years before, though Branitz was\r\nbut a few leagues away. He was recognised at once, and great was the\r\njoy in the little town over the return of its old ruler, who was\r\nhonoured with illuminations, the discharge of cannon, and torchlight\r\nprocessions. The estate had passed into the hands of Prince Frederick\r\nof the Netherlands, who had carried out all its former master's plans,\r\nand added many improvements of his own. Pückler generously admired the\r\nsplendour that he had had so large a share in creating, and then went\r\ncontentedly back to his _kleine Branitz_, his only regret being\r\nthat he could not live to see it, like Muskau, in the fulness of its\r\nmatured beauty. In 1866, when war broke out between Prussia and\r\nAustria, this grand old man of eighty-one volunteered for active\r\nservice, and begged to be attached to the headquarters' staff. His\r\nrequest was granted, and he went gallantly through the brief campaign,\r\nbut was bitterly disappointed because he was not able to be present at\r\nthe battle of Koniggrätz, owing to the indisposition of the king, upon\r\nwhom he was in attendance.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, when France declared war against Prussia, he again\r\nvolunteered, and was deeply mortified when the king declined his\r\nservices on account of his advanced age. For the first time he seems\r\nto have realised that he was old, and it is probable that the\r\ndisappointment preyed upon his spirits, for his strength rapidly\r\ndeclined, his memory failed, and on February 4,1871, after a brief\r\nillness, he sank peacefully to rest. He was buried in a tomb that he\r\nhad built for himself many years before, a pyramid sixty feet high,\r\nwhich stood upon an acre of ground in the centre of an artificial\r\nlake. The two inscriptions that the prince chose for his sepulchre\r\nillustrate, appropriately enough, the sharply contrasting qualities of\r\nhis strange individuality--his romantic sentimentality, and his\r\ncallous cynicism. The first inscription was a line from the Koran:\r\n\r\n   'Graves are the mountain summits of a far-off, fairer world.'\r\n\r\nThe second, chosen presumably for the sake of the paradox, was the\r\nFrench apothegm:\r\n\r\n      'Allons\r\n       Chez\r\n   Pluto plutôt plus tard.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AND MARY HOWITT\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary Howitt From a portrait by Margaret Gillies]\r\n\r\nThe names of William and Mary Howitt are inextricably associated with\r\nthe England of the early nineteenth century, with the re-discovery of\r\nthe beauty and interest of their native land, with the renaissance of\r\nthe national passion for country pleasures and country pursuits, and\r\nwith the slow, painful struggle for a wider freedom, a truer humanity,\r\na fuller, more gracious life. The Howitts had no genius, nor were they\r\npioneers, but, where the unfamiliar was concerned, they were\r\nopen-minded and receptive to a degree that is unfortunately rare in\r\npersons of their perfect uprightness and strong natural piety. If they\r\nflashed no new radiance upon the world, they were always among the\r\nfirst to kindle their little torches at the new lamps; and they did\r\ngood service in handing back the light to those who, but for them,\r\nwould have had sat in the shadow, and flung stones at the\r\nincomprehensible illuminations.\r\n\r\nOf the two minds, Mary's was the finer and the more original. It was\r\none of those everyday miracles--the miracles that do happen--that in\r\nspite of the severity, the narrowness, the repression of her early\r\ntraining, she should have forced her way through the shell of rigid\r\nsectarianism, repudiated her heritage of drab denials, and opened both\r\nheart and mind to the new poetry, the new art, and the new knowledge.\r\nIn her husband she found a kindred spirit, and during the more than\r\nfifty years of their pilgrimage together their eyes were ever turned\r\ntowards the same goal. Though not equally gifted, they were equally\r\ndisinterested, equally enlightened, and equally anxious for the\r\nadvancement of humanity. They took themselves and their vocation\r\nseriously, and produced an immense quantity of careful, conscientious\r\nwork, the work of honest craftsmen rather than artists, with the\r\nquality of a finished piece of cabinet-making, or a strip of fine\r\nembroidery.\r\n\r\nMary Howitt was the daughter of Samuel Botham, a land-surveyor at\r\nUttoxeter. His father, the descendant of a long line of Staffordshire\r\nyeomen, Quakers by persuasion, loved a roaming life, and having\r\nmarried a maltster's widow with a talent for business management, was\r\nleft free to indulge his own propensities. He seems to have had a\r\ntalent for medical science of an empirical kind, for he dabbled in\r\nmagnetism and electricity, and wandered about the country collecting\r\nherbs for headache--snuffs, and healing ointments. Samuel, as soon as\r\nhe had served his apprenticeship, found plenty of employment in the\r\nneighbourhood, the country gentlemen, who had taken alarm at the\r\nrevolutionary ideas newly introduced from France, being anxious to\r\nhave their acres measured, and their boundaries accurately defined.\r\nWhile at work upon Lord Talbot's Welsh estates in 1795, he became\r\nattracted by a 'convinced' Friend, named Ann Wood. The interesting\r\ndiscovery that both had a passion for nuts, together with the gentle\r\nmatch-making of a Quaker patriarch, led to an engagement, and the\r\ncouple were married in December, 1796.\r\n\r\nAnn Wood was the granddaughter of William Wood, whose contract for\r\nsupplying Ireland with copper coin (obtained by bribing the Duchess of\r\nKendal) was turned into a national grievance by Swift, and led to the\r\npublication of the _Drapier Letters_. Although Wood's half-pence\r\nwere admitted to be excellent coin, and Ireland was short of copper,\r\nthe feeling against their circulation was so intense, that Ministers\r\nwere obliged to withdraw the patent, Wood being compensated for his\r\nlosses with a grant of £3000 a year for a term of years, and 'places'\r\nfor some of his fifteen children. Ann's father, Charles, when very\r\nyoung, was appointed assay-master to Jamaica. After his return to\r\nEngland in middle life he married a lively widow, went into business\r\nas an iron-master near Merthyr Tydvil, and distinguished himself by\r\nintroducing platinum into Europe, having first met with the semi-metal\r\nin Jamaica, whither it had been brought from Carthagena in New Spain.\r\nAfter his death, Ann, the only serious member of a 'worldly' family,\r\nfound it impossible to remain in the frivolous atmosphere of her home,\r\nand determined, in modern fashion, to 'live her own life.' After\r\nspending some years as governess or companion in various families, she\r\nbecame converted to Quaker doctrines, and was received into the\r\nSociety of Friends.\r\n\r\nSamuel Botham took his bride to live in the paternal home at\r\nUttoxeter, where the preparation of the old quack doctor's herbal\r\nmedicines caused her a great deal of discomfort. In the course of the\r\nnext three years two daughters were born to the couple; Anna in 1797,\r\nand Mary on March 12, 1799. At the time of Mary's birth her parents\r\nwere passing through a period of pecuniary distress, owing to a\r\ndisastrous speculation; but with the opening of the new century a\r\npiece of great good fortune befell Samuel Botham. He was one of the\r\ntwo surveyors chosen to enclose and divide the Chase of Needwood in\r\nthe county of Stafford. In the early years of the nineteenth century\r\nthere was, unfortunately for England, a mania for enclosing commons,\r\nand felling ancient forests. Needwood, which extended for many miles,\r\ncontained great numbers of magnificent old oaks, limes, and hollies,\r\nand no less than twenty thousand head of deer. In after years, Mary\r\nHowitt often regretted that her family should have had a hand in the\r\ndestruction of so vast an extent of solitude and beauty, in a country\r\nthat was already thickly populated and trimly cultivated. Still, for\r\nthe nine years that the work of 'disafforesting' lasted, the two\r\nlittle girls got a great deal of enjoyment out of the ruined Chase,\r\nspending long summer days in its grassy glades, while their father\r\nparcelled out the land and marked trees for the axe.\r\n\r\nIn her _Autobiography_ [Footnote: Edited by her daughter\r\nMargaret, and published by Messrs. Isbister in 1889.] Mary declares\r\nthat it is impossible for her to give an adequate idea of the\r\nstillness and isolation of her childish life. So intense was the\r\nsilence of the Quaker household, that, at four years old, Anna had to\r\nbe sent to a dame's school in order that she might learn to talk;\r\nwhile even after both children had attained the use of speech, their\r\nignorance of the right names for the most ordinary feelings and\r\nactions obliged them to coin words of their own. 'My childhood was\r\nhappy in many respects,' she writes. 'It was so, as far as physical\r\nhealth, the enjoyment of a beautiful country, and the companionship of\r\na dearly loved sister could make it--but oh, there was such a cloud\r\nover all from the extreme severity of a so-called religious education,\r\nit almost made cowards and hypocrites of us, and made us feel that, if\r\nthis were religion, it was a thing to be feared and hated.' The family\r\nreading consisted chiefly of the writings of Madame Guyon, Thomas à\r\nKempis, and St. Francis de Sales, while for light literature there\r\nwere Telemachus, Fox's _Book of Martyrs_, and a work on the\r\n_Persecution of the Friends_. But it is impossible for even the\r\nmost pious of Quakers to guard against all the stratagems by which the\r\nspirit of evil--or human nature--contrives to gain an entrance into a\r\ngodly household. In the case of the Botham children an early knowledge\r\nof good and evil was learnt from an apparently respectable nurse, who\r\nmade her little charges acquainted with most of the scandals of the\r\nneighbourhood, accustomed their infant ears to oaths, and--most\r\nterrible of all--taught them to play whist, she herself taking dummy,\r\nand transforming the nursery tea-tray into a card-table. In that\r\nsilent household it was easy to keep a secret, and though the little\r\ngirls often trembled at their nurse's language, they never betrayed\r\nher confidence.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 another daughter, Emma, was born to the Bothams, and in 1808 a\r\nson, Charles. In the midst of their joy and amazement at the news that\r\nthey had a brother, the little girls asked each other anxiously: 'Will\r\nour parents like it?' Only a short time before a stranger had inquired\r\nif they had any brothers, and they had replied in all seriousness: 'Oh\r\nno, our parents do not approve of boys.' Now, much to their relief,\r\nthey found that their father and mother highly approved of their own\r\nboy, who became the spoilt darling of the austere household. A new\r\nnurse was engaged for the son and heir, a lady of many love-affairs,\r\nwho made Mary her confidante, and induced the child, then nine years\r\nold, to write an imaginary love-letter. The unlucky letter was laid\r\nbetween the pages of the worthy Madame Guyon, and there discovered by\r\nMr. Botham. Not much was said on the subject of the document, which\r\nseems to have been considered too awful to bear discussion; but the\r\nchildren were removed from the influence of the nurse, and allowed to\r\nattend a day-school in the neighbourhood, though only on condition\r\nthat they sat apart from the other children in order to avoid\r\ncontamination with possible worldlings.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 the two elder sisters were sent to a Quaker school at Croydon,\r\nwhere they found themselves the youngest, the most provincial, and the\r\nworst dressed of the little community. Even in advanced old age, Mary\r\nhad a keen memory for the costumes of her childhood, and the\r\nmortification that these had caused her. On their arrival at school\r\nthe little girls were attired in brown pelisses, cut plain and\r\nstraight, without plait or fold, and hooked down the front to obviate\r\nthe necessity for buttons, which, being in the nature of trimmings,\r\nwere regarded as an indulgence of the lust of the eye. On their heads\r\nthey wore little drab beaver bonnets, also destitute of trimmings, and\r\nso plain in shape that even the Quaker hatter had to order special\r\nblocks for their manufacture. The other girls were busy over various\r\nkinds of fashionable fancy-work, but the little Bothams were expected,\r\nin their leisure moments, to make half-a-dozen linen shirts for their\r\nfather, button-holes and all. They had never learnt to net, to weave\r\ncoloured paper into baskets, to plait split straw into patterns, nor\r\nany of the other amateur handicrafts of the day. But they were clever\r\nwith their fingers, and could copy almost anything that they had seen\r\ndone. 'We could buckle flax or spin a rope,' writes Mary. 'We could\r\ndrive a nail, put in a screw or draw it out. We knew the use of a\r\nglue-pot, and how to paper a room. We soon furnished ourselves with\r\ncoloured paper for plaiting, and straw to split and weave into net;\r\nand I shall never forget my admiration of a pattern of diamonds woven\r\nwith strips of gold paper on a black ground. It was my first attempt\r\nat artistic handiwork.'\r\n\r\nAfter a few months at Croydon the girls were recalled to Uttoxeter on\r\naccount of their mother's illness; and as soon as she recovered they\r\nwere despatched to another Friends' school at Sheffield. In 1812, when\r\nMary was only thirteen and Anna fifteen, their education was supposed\r\nto be completed, and they returned home for good. But Mr. Botham was\r\ndissatisfied with his daughters' attainments, and engaged the master\r\nof the boys' school to teach them Latin, mathematics, and the use of\r\nthe globes. The death of this instructor obliged them thenceforward to\r\nrely on a system of self-education. 'We retained and perfected our\r\nrudimentary knowledge,' Mary writes, 'by instructing others. Our\r\nfather fitted up a school-room for us in the stable-loft, where, twice\r\na week, we were allowed to teach poor children. In this room, also, we\r\ninstructed our dear little brother and sister. Our father, in his\r\nbeautiful handwriting, used to set them copies, texts of Scripture,\r\nsuch as he no doubt had found of a consolatory nature. On one\r\noccasion, however, I set the copies, and well remember the tribulation\r\nI experienced in consequence. I always warred in my mind against the\r\nenforced gloom of our home, and having for my private reading at that\r\ntime Young's _Night Thoughts_, came upon what seemed to me the\r\nvery spirit of true religion, a cheerful heart gathering up the\r\njoyfulness of surrounding nature; on which the poet says: \"'Tis\r\nimpious in a good man to be sad.\" How I rejoiced in this!--and\r\nthinking it a great fact which ought to be noised abroad, wrote it\r\ndown in my best hand as a copy. It fell under our father's eye, and\r\nsorely grieved he was at such a sentiment, and extremely angry with me\r\nas its promulgator.'\r\n\r\nThe sisters can never have found the time hang heavy on their hands,\r\nfor in addition to their educational duties, their mother required\r\nthem to be expert in all household matters; while, in their scanty\r\nhours of leisure, they attempted, in the face of every kind of\r\ndiscouragement, to satisfy their strong natural craving for beauty and\r\nknowledge. 'We studied poetry, botany, and flower-painting,' Mary\r\nwrites. 'These pursuits were almost out of the pale of permitted\r\nQuaker pleasures, but we pursued them with a perfect passion, doing in\r\nsecret that which we dared not do openly, such as reading Shakespeare,\r\nthe elder novelists, and translations of the classics. We studied\r\nFrench and chemistry, and enabled ourselves to read Latin, storing our\r\nminds with a whole mass of heterogeneous knowledge. This was good as\r\nfar as it went, but I now deplore the secrecy, the subterfuge, and the\r\nfear under which this ill-digested, ill-arranged knowledge was\r\nobtained.'\r\n\r\nThe young Quakeresses picked up ideas and models for their artistic\r\nhandicraft from the most unlikely sources. A shop-window, full of\r\ndusty plaster medallions for mantelpiece decorations, gave them their\r\nfirst notions of classic design. The black Wedgwood ware was to be\r\nseen in nearly every house in Uttoxeter, while a few of the more\r\nprosperous inhabitants possessed vases and jugs in the pale blue ware,\r\nornamented with graceful figures. These precious specimens the Botham\r\nsisters used to borrow, and contrived to reproduce the figures by\r\nmeans of moulds made of paper pulp. They also etched flowers and\r\nlandscapes on panes of glass, and manufactured 'transparencies' out of\r\ndifferent thicknesses of cap-paper. 'I feel a sort of tender pity for\r\nAnna and myself,' wrote Mary long afterwards, 'when I remember how we\r\nwere always seeking and struggling after the beautiful, and after\r\nartistic production, though we knew nothing of art. I am thankful that\r\nwe made no alms-baskets, or hideous abortions of that kind. What we\r\ndid was from the innate yearnings of our souls for perfection in form\r\nand colour; and our accomplished work, though crude and poor, was the\r\ngenuine outcome of our own individuality.'\r\n\r\nIt was one of the heaviest crosses of Mary's girlish days that she and\r\nAnna were not permitted to exercise their clever fingers, and indulge\r\ntheir taste for the beautiful, in their own dress. But they found a\r\nfaint vicarious pleasure in making pretty summer gowns, and\r\nembroidering elaborate muslin collars for a girl-friend who was\r\nallowed to wear fashionable clothes, and even to go to balls. Even\r\ntheir ultra-plain costumes, however, could not disguise the fact that\r\nAnna and Mary Botham were comely damsels, and they had several suitors\r\namong the young men-Friends of Uttoxeter. But the sisters held a low\r\nopinion of the mental endowments of the average Quaker, an opinion\r\nthat was only shaken by a report of the marvellous attainments of\r\nyoung William Howitt of Heanor, who was said to be not only a scholar,\r\nbut a born genius. William's mother, Phoebe, herself a noted amateur\r\nhealer, was an old friend of Mary's grandfather, the herbal doctor,\r\nbut the young people had never met. However, in the autumn of 1818,\r\nWilliam paid a visit to some relations at Uttoxeter, and there made\r\nthe acquaintance of the Botham girls, who discovered that this young\r\nman-Friend shared nearly all their interests, and was full of sympathy\r\nwith their studies and pursuits.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year Mary Botham was engaged to William Howitt,\r\nhe being then six-and-twenty and she nineteen. 'The tastes of my\r\nfuture husband and my own were strongly similar,' she observes, 'so\r\nalso was our mental culture; but he was in every direction so far in\r\nadvance of me as to become my teacher and guide. Knowledge in the\r\nbroadest sense was the aim of our intellectual efforts; poetry and\r\nnature were the paths that led to it. Of ballad poetry I was already\r\nenamoured, William made me acquainted with the realistic life-pictures\r\nof Crabbe; the bits of nature and poetry in the vignettes of Bewick;\r\nwith the earliest works of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, and the\r\nfirst marvellous prose productions of the author of _Waverley_.'\r\n\r\nAfter an engagement lasting a little more than two years, William and\r\nMary were married on April 16, 1821, the bride wearing her first silk\r\ngown--a pretty dove-colour--and a white silk shawl, finery which\r\nfilled her soul with rapture. The couple spent the honeymoon in the\r\nbridegroom's native Derbyshire, visiting every spot of beauty or haunt\r\nof old tradition in that country of the romantic and the picturesque.\r\nIncorporated in his wife's _Autobiography _is William Howitt's\r\nnarrative of his parentage and youthful days, which is supplemented by\r\nhis _Boys' Country Book_, the true story of his early adventures\r\nand experiences. The Howitts, he tells us, were descended from a\r\nfamily named Hewitt, the younger branch of which obtained Wansley\r\nHall, near Nottingham, through marriage with an heiress, and changed\r\nthe spelling of their name. His ancestors had been, for generations, a\r\nrollicking set, all wofully lacking in prudence and sobriety.\r\nAbout the end of the seventeenth century, one Thomas Howitt,\r\ngreat-great-grandfather of William, married Catherine, heiress of the\r\nCharltons of Chilwell. But Thomas so disgusted his father-in-law by\r\nhis drunken habits that Mr. Charlton disinherited his daughter, who\r\nloyally refused to leave her husband, and left his property to a\r\nstranger who chanced to bear his name. After this misfortune the\r\nHowitts descended somewhat in the social scale, and, having no more\r\nsubstance to waste, reformed their ways and forsook all riotous\r\nliving. William's father, who held a post as manager of a Derbyshire\r\ncolliery, married a Quaker lady, Phoebe Tantum of the Fall, Heanor,\r\nand was himself received into the Society of Friends in 1783.\r\n\r\nWilliam received a good plain education at a Quaker school at\r\nAckworth, and grew up a genuine country lad, scouring the lanes on his\r\nfamous grey pony, Peter Scroggins, the acknowledged leader of the\r\nvillage lads in bird-nesting and rat-hunting expeditions, and taking\r\nhis full share of the work on his father's little farm. Long\r\nafterwards he used to say that every scene in and about Heanor was\r\nphotographed with absolute distinctness on his brain, and he loved to\r\nrecall the long days that he had spent in following the plough,\r\nchopping turnips for the cattle, tramping over the snow-covered fields\r\nafter red-wing and fieldfare, collecting acorns for the swine, or\r\nhunting through the barns for eggs. The Howitt family was much less\r\nstrict than that of the Bothams, for in the winter evenings the boys\r\nwere allowed to play draughts and dominoes, while at Christmas there\r\nwere games of forfeits, blind-man's buff, and fishing for the ring in\r\nthe great posset-pot.\r\n\r\nOn leaving school at fifteen, William amused himself for a couple of\r\nyears on the farm, though, curiously enough, he never thought of\r\nbecoming a farmer in good earnest; indeed, at this time he seems to\r\nhave had no distinct bias towards any profession. Mr. Howitt had\r\nsomehow become imbued with Rousseau's doctrine that every boy,\r\nwhatever his position in life, should learn a mechanical handicraft,\r\nin order that, if all else failed, he might be able to earn his own\r\nliving by the labour of his hands. Having decided that William should\r\nlearn carpentering, the boy was apprenticed for four years to a\r\ncarpenter and builder at Mansfield, on the outskirts of Sherwood\r\nForest. The four precious years were practically thrown away, except\r\nfor the enjoyment obtained from long solitary rambles amid the\r\npicturesque associations of the Forest, and the knowledge of natural\r\nhistory gained from close observation of the wild life of that\r\nromantic district.\r\n\r\nIt was not until his twenty-first birthday that William's indentures\r\nwere out, and as he was still unable to make up his mind about a\r\nprofession--it must be remembered that the law, the church, the army\r\nand navy were all closed to a Quaker--he spent the next seven years at\r\nhome, angling in the streams like his favourite hero, Isaac Walton,\r\nand striving, by dint of hard study, to make up the many deficiencies\r\nin his education. He taught himself Latin, French, and Italian,\r\nbesides working at botany, chemistry, and the dispensing of medicines.\r\nIt was during these seven years of uncertainty and experiment that\r\nWilliam read Washington Irving's _Sketches of Geoffrey Crayon_,\r\nwhich produced a strong impression on his mind. With the inspiration\r\nof this book hot upon him, he made a tour on foot through the Peak\r\ncountry, and afterwards wrote an account of his adventures in what he\r\nfondly believed to be the style of Geoffrey Crayon. The paper was\r\nprinted in a local journal under the title of _A Pedestrian\r\nPilgrimage through the Peak_, by Wilfrid Wendle. This was not\r\nWilliam Howitt's first literary essay, some stanzas of his on Spring,\r\nwritten when he was only thirteen, having been printed in the\r\n_Monthly Magazine_, with his name and age attached.\r\n\r\nWith the prospect of marriage it was thought desirable that William\r\nshould have some regular calling. Without, so far as appears, passing\r\nany examinations or obtaining any certificates, he bought the business\r\nof a chemist and druggist in Hanley, and thither, though with no\r\nintention of settling permanently in the Potteries, he took his bride\r\nas soon as the honeymoon was over. Only seven months were spent at\r\nHanley, and in December, 1821, the couple were preparing to move to\r\nNottingham, where William had bought the good-will of another\r\nchemist's business. But before settling down in their new home, the\r\nHowitts undertook a long pedestrian tour through Scotland and the\r\nnorth of England, in the course of which they explored the Rob Roy\r\ncountry, rambled through Fife, made acquaintance with the beauties of\r\nEdinburgh, looked in upon Robert Owen's model factories at New Lanark,\r\ngot a glimpse of Walter Scott at Melrose, were mistaken for a runaway\r\ncouple at Gretna Green, gazed reverently on Rydal Mount, and tramped\r\nin all no less than five hundred miles. An account of the tour was\r\ncontributed to a Staffordshire paper under the title of _A Scottish\r\nRamble in the Spring of 1822_, by Wilfrid and Wilfreda Wendle.\r\n\r\nIt was not until August, 1822, that the pair established themselves in\r\na little house at Nottingham. Of the chemist's business we hear\r\npractically nothing in Mary's narrative, but a great deal about the\r\nliterary enterprises in which husband and wife collaborated. They\r\nbegan by collecting the poems, of which each had a large number ready\r\nwritten, and, in fear and trembling, prepared to submit them to the\r\nverdict of critics and public. 'It seems strange to me,' wrote Mary,\r\nwhen she informed her sister of this modest venture, 'and I cannot\r\nreconcile myself to the thought of seeing my own name staring me in\r\nthe face in every bookseller's window, or being pointed at and peeped\r\nafter as a writer of verses.' In April, 1823, _The Forest Minstrel\r\nand other Poems_, by William and Mary Howitt, made its appearance\r\nin a not particularly appreciative world. The verses were chiefly\r\ndescriptive of country sights and sounds, and had been produced, as\r\nstated in the Preface, 'not for the sake of writing, but for the\r\nindulgence of our own overflowing feelings.' The little book created\r\nno sensation, but it was kindly noticed, and seems to have attracted a\r\nfew quiet readers who, like the writers, were lovers of nature and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nDuring these early years at Nottingham the Howitts kept up, as far as\r\ntheir opportunities allowed, with the thought and literature of their\r\nday, and never relaxed their anxious efforts after 'mental\r\nimprovement.' William's brother, Richard, himself a budding poet, was\r\nat this time an inmate of the little household, which was increased in\r\n1824 by the birth of a daughter, Anna Mary. Although the couple still\r\nremained in the Quaker fold, they were gradually discarding the\r\npeculiar dress and speech of the 'plain' Friends. They were evidently\r\nregarded as terribly 'advanced' young people in their own circle, and\r\nshocked many of their old acquaintances by the catholicity of their\r\nviews, by their admiration of Byron and Shelley, and by the liberal\r\ntone of their own productions. Like most of the lesser writers of that\r\nday, they found their way into the popular Keepsakes and Annuals,\r\nwhich Mary accurately describes as 'a chaffy, frivolous, and\r\nunsatisfactory style of publication, that only serves to keep a young\r\nauthor in the mind of the public, and to bring in a little cash.' In\r\n1826 Mrs. Howitt was preparing for the press a new volume of poems by\r\nherself and her husband, _The Desolation of Eyam_, and in a\r\nletter to her sister, now transformed into Mrs. Daniel Wilson, she\r\ndescribes her sensations while awaiting the ordeal of critical\r\njudgment, and expresses her not very flattering opinion of the\r\ncontemporary reviewer.\r\n\r\n'Nobody that has not published,' she observes, 'can tell the almost\r\npainful excitement which the first opinions occasion. Really, for some\r\ndays I was quite nervous. William boasted of possessing his mind in\r\nwise passivity, and truly his imperturbable patience was quite an\r\nannoyance; I therefore got Rogers's beautiful poem on Italy to read,\r\nand so diverted my thoughts. Everything in the literary world is done\r\nby favour and connections. It is a miracle to me how our former\r\nvolume, when we were quite unknown, got favourably noticed. In many\r\ncases a book is reviewed which has never been read, or even seen\r\nexternally.'\r\n\r\nBy this time the young authors who, to use Mary's own phrase, hungered\r\nand thirsted after acquaintances who were highly gifted in mind or\r\nprofound in knowledge, had acquired one or two literary friends and\r\ncorrespondents, among them Mrs. Hemans, Bernard Barton, the Quaker\r\npoet, and the Alaric Watts's of Keepsake fame. An occasional notice of\r\nthe Howitts and their little household may be found in contemporary\r\nworks by forgotten writers. For example, Sir Richard Phillips, in the\r\nsection devoted to Nottingham of his quaintly-worded _Personal Tour\r\nthrough the United Kingdom _(1828), observes: 'Of Messrs. Howitt,\r\nhusband and wife, conjugal in love and poetry, it would be vain for me\r\nto speak. Their tasteful productions belong to the nation as well as\r\nto Nottingham. As a man of taste Mr. Howitt married a lady of taste;\r\nand with rare amiability they have jointly cultivated the Muses, and\r\nproduced some volumes of poetry, consisting of pieces under their\r\nseparate names. The circumstance afforded a topic for ridicule to some\r\nof those anonymous critics who abuse the press and disgrace\r\nliterature; but no one ventured to assail their productions.' Spencer\r\nHall, a fellow-townsman, became acquainted with the Howitts in 1829,\r\nand in his _Reminiscences_ describes William as a bright, neat,\r\nquick, dapper man of medium height, with a light complexion, blue\r\neyes, and brisk, cheery speech. Mary, he tells us; was always neatly\r\ndressed, but with nothing prim or sectarian in her style. 'Her\r\nexpression was frank and free, yet very modest, and she was blessed\r\nwith an affectionate, sociable spirit.'\r\n\r\nA presentation copy of _The Desolation of Eyam_ was sent to the\r\nHowitts' favourite poet, Wordsworth, who, in acknowledging their\r\n'elegant volume,' declared that, though he had only had time to turn\r\nover the leaves, he had found several poems which had already afforded\r\nhim no small gratification. The harmless little book was denounced by\r\nthe _Eclectic Review_ as 'anti-Quakerish, atheistical, and\r\nlicentious in style and sentiment, 'but the authors were consoled by a\r\ncharming little notice of their contributions to the Annuals in the\r\n_Noctes Ambrosianae_ for November, 1828. 'Who are these three\r\nbrothers and sisters, the Howitts, sir?' asks the Shepherd of\r\nChristopher North, in the course of a discussion of the Christmas\r\ngift-books, 'whose names I see in the adverteesements?'\r\n\r\n_North_. I don't know, James. It runs in my head that they are\r\nQuakers. Richard and William seem amiable and ingenious men, and\r\nSister Mary writes beautifully.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd_. What do you mean by beautifully? That's vague.\r\n\r\n_North_. Her language is chaste and simple, her feelings tender\r\nand pure, and her observation of nature accurate and intense. Her\r\n'Sketches from Natural History' in the _Christmas Box_ have much\r\nof the moral--nay, rather the religious spirit--that permeates all\r\nWordsworth's smaller poems, however light and slight the subject, and\r\nshow that Mary Howitt is not only well-read in the book of Bewick, but\r\nalso in the book from which Bewick has borrowed all--glorious\r\nplagiarist--and every other inspired zoologist--\r\n\r\n_Shepherd_. The Book o' Natur'.'\r\n\r\nThe great event of 1829 for the Howitts was a visit to London, where\r\nthey were the guests of Alaric and Zillah Watts, with whom they had\r\nlong maintained a paper friendship. 'What wilt thou say, dear Anna,'\r\nwrites Mary in December, 'when I tell thee that William and I set out\r\nfor London the day after to-morrow. I half dread it. I shall wish\r\ntwenty times for our quiet fireside, where day by day we read and talk\r\nby ourselves, and nobody looks in upon us. I keep reasoning with\r\nmyself that the people we shall see in London are but men and women,\r\nand perhaps, after all, no better than ourselves. If we could but\r\ndivest our minds of _self_, as our dear father used to say we\r\nshould do, it would be better and more comfortable for us. Yet it is\r\none of the faults peculiar to us Bothams that, with all the desire\r\nthere was to make us regardless of self, we never had confidence and\r\nproper self-respect instilled into us, and the want of this gives us a\r\ndepressing feeling, though I hope it is less seen by others than by\r\nourselves.... We do not intend to stay more than a week, and thou may\r\nbelieve we shall have enough to do. We have to make special calls on\r\nthe Carter Halls, Dr. Bowring, and the Pringles, and are to be\r\nintroduced to their ramifications of acquaintance. Allan Cunningham,\r\nL. E. L., and Thomas Roscoe we are sure to see.'\r\n\r\nIn Miss Landon's now forgotten novel, _Romance and Reality_,\r\nthere is a little sketch of Mary Howitt as she appeared at a literary\r\n_soirée_, during her brief visit to London. The heroine, Miss\r\nArundel, is being initiated into the mysteries of the writing world by\r\nher friend, Mrs. Sullivan, when her attention is arrested by the sight\r\nof 'a female in a Quaker's dress--the quiet, dark silk dress--the hair\r\nsimply parted on the forehead--the small, close cap--the placid,\r\nsubdued expression of the face, were all in strong contrast to the\r\ncrimsons, yellows, and blues around. The general character of the\r\nlarge, soft eyes seemed sweetness; but they were now lighted up with\r\nan expression of intelligent observation--that clear, animated, and\r\ncomprehensive glance which shows it analyses what it observes. You\r\nlooked at her with something of the sensation with which, while\r\ntravelling along a dusty road, the eye fixes on some green field,\r\nwhere the hour flings its sunshine and the tree its shadow, as if its\r\npure fresh beauty was a thing apart from the soil and tumult of the\r\nhighway. \"You see,\" said Mrs. Sullivan, \"one who, in a brief\r\ninterview, gave me more the idea of a poet than most of our modern\r\nvotaries of the lute.... She is as creative in her imaginary poems as\r\nshe is touching and true in her simpler ones.\"'\r\n\r\nThough there were still giants upon the earth in those far-off days,\r\nthe general standard of literary taste was by no means exalted, a fact\r\nwhich Mary Howitt could hardly be expected to realise. She seems to\r\nhave taken the praises lavished on her simple verses over-seriously,\r\nand to have imagined herself in very truth a poet. She was more\r\nclear-sighted where the work of her fellow-scribes was concerned, and\r\nin a letter written about this time, she descants upon the dearth of\r\ngood literature in a somewhat disillusioned vein. After expressing her\r\ndesire that some mighty spirit would rise up and give an impulse to\r\npoetry, she continues: 'I am tired of Sir Walter Scott and his\r\nimitators, and I am sickened of Mrs. Hemans's luscious poetry, and all\r\nher tribe of copyists. The libraries set in array one school against\r\nanother, and hurry out the trashy volumes before the ink of the\r\nmanuscript is fairly dry. Dost thou remember the days when Byron's\r\npoems first came out, now one and then another, at sufficient\r\nintervals to allow of digesting them? And dost thou remember our first\r\nreading of _Lalla Rookh_? It was on a washing-day. We read and\r\nclapped our clear-starching, read and clapped, and read again, and all\r\nthe time our souls were not on this earth.'\r\n\r\nThere was one book then in course of preparation which Mary thought\r\nworthy to have been read, even in those literary clear-starching days.\r\n'Thou hast no idea,' she assures her sister, 'how very interesting\r\nWilliam's work, now called _A Book of the Seasons_, has become.\r\nIt contains original sketches on every month, with every\r\ncharacteristic of the season, and a garden department which will fill\r\nthy heart brimful of all garden delights, greenness, and boweriness.\r\nMountain scenery and lake scenery, meadows and woods, hamlets, farms,\r\nhalls, storm and sunshine--all are in this most delicious book,\r\ngrouped into a most harmonious whole.' Unfortunately, publishers were\r\nhard to convince of the merits of the new work, the first of William\r\nHowitt's rural series, and it was declined by four houses in turn. The\r\nauthor at last suggested that a stone should be tied to the unlucky\r\nmanuscript, and that it should be flung over London Bridge; but his\r\nwife was not so easily disheartened. She was certain that the book was\r\na worthy book, and only needed to be made a little more 'personable'\r\nto find favour in the eyes of a publisher. Accordingly, blotted sheets\r\nwere hastily re-copied, new articles introduced, and passages of\r\ndubious interest omitted, husband and wife working together at this\r\nremodelling until their fingers ached and their eyes were as dim as an\r\nowl's in sunshine. Their labours were rewarded by the acceptance of\r\nthe work by Bentley and Colburn, and its triumphant success with both\r\ncritics and public, seven editions being called for in the first few\r\nmonths of its career.\r\n\r\n'Prig it and pocket it,' says Christopher North, alluding to the\r\n_Book of the Seasons_ in the _Noctes_ for April, 1831. ''Tis\r\na jewel.'\r\n\r\n'Is Nottingham far intil England, sir?' asks the simple Shepherd, to\r\nwhom the above advice is given. 'For I would really like to pay the\r\nHooits a visit this simmer. Thae Quakers are what we micht scarcely\r\nopine frae first principles, a maist poetical Christian seck.... The\r\ntwa married Hooits I love just excessively, sir. What they write canna\r\nfail o' being poetry, even the most middlin' o't, for it's aye wi'\r\nthem the ebullition o' their ain feeling and their ain fancy, and\r\nwhenever that's the case, a bonny word or twa will drap itself intil\r\nilka stanzy, and a sweet stanzy or twa intil ilka pome, and sae they\r\ntouch, and sae they win a body's heart.'\r\n\r\nThe year 1831 was rendered memorable to the Howitts, not only by their\r\nfirst literary success, but also by an unexpected visit from their\r\npoetical idol, Mr. Wordsworth. The poet, his wife and daughter, were\r\non their way home from London when Mrs. Wordsworth was suddenly taken\r\nill, and was unable to proceed farther than Nottingham. Her husband,\r\nin great perplexity, came to ask advice of the Howitts, who insisted\r\nthat the invalid should be removed to their house, where she remained\r\nfor ten days before she was able to continue her journey. Wordsworth\r\nhimself was only able to stay one night, but in that short time he\r\nmade a very favourable impression upon his host and hostess.\r\n'He is worthy of being the author of _The Excursion_, _Ruth_, and\r\nthose sweet poems so full of human sympathy,' writes Mary. 'He is a\r\nkind man, full of strong feeling and sound judgment. My greatest\r\ndelight was that he seemed so pleased with William's conversation.\r\nThey seemed quite in their element, pouring out their eloquent\r\nsentiments on the future prospects of society, and on all subjects\r\nconnected with poetry and the interests of man. Nor are we less\r\npleased with Mrs. Wordsworth and her lovely daughter, Dora. They are\r\nthe most grateful people; everything that we do for them is right, and\r\nthe very best it can be.'\r\n\r\nDuring the next two or three years Mary produced a volume of dramatic\r\nsketches, called _The Seven Temptations_, which she always\r\nregarded as her best and most original work, but which was damned by\r\nthe critics and neglected by the public; a little book of natural\r\nhistory for children; and a novel in three volumes, called _Wood\r\nLeighton_, which seems to have had some success. _The Seven\r\nTemptations_, it must be owned, is a rather lugubrious production,\r\nprobably inspired by Joanna Baillie's _Plays on the Passions_.\r\nThe scene of _Wood Leighton_ is laid at Uttoxeter, and the book\r\nis not so much a connected tale as a series of sketches descriptive of\r\nscenes and characters in and about the author's early home. It is\r\nevident that Mrs. Botham and Sister Anna looked somewhat\r\ndisapprovingly upon so much literary work for the mistress of a\r\nhousehold, since we find Mary writing in eager defence of her chosen\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\n'I want to make thee, and more particularly dear mother, see,' she\r\nexplains, 'that I am not out of my line of duty in devoting myself so\r\nmuch to literary occupation. Just lately things were sadly against us.\r\nDear William could not sleep at night, and the days were dark and\r\ngloomy. Altogether, I was at my wits' end. I turned over in my mind\r\nwhat I could do next, for till William's _Rural Life_ was\r\nfinished we had nothing available. Then I bethought myself of all\r\nthose little verses and prose tales that for years I had written for\r\nthe juvenile Annuals. It seemed probable I might turn them to some\r\naccount. In about a week I had nearly all the poetry copied; and then\r\nwho should come to Nottingham but John Darton [a Quaker publisher]. He\r\nfell into the idea immediately, took what I had copied up to London\r\nwith him, and I am to have a hundred and fifty guineas for them. Have\r\nI not reason to feel that in thus writing I was fulfilling a duty?'\r\n\r\nIn 1833 William Hewitt's _History of Priestcraft_ appeared, a\r\nwork which was publicly denounced at the Friends' yearly meeting, all\r\ngood Quakers being cautioned not to read it. William hitherto had\r\nlived in great retirement at Nottingham, but he was now claimed by the\r\nRadical and Nonconformist members of the community as their spokesman\r\nand champion. In January, 1834, he and Joseph Gilbert (husband of Ann\r\nGilbert of _Original Poems_ fame) were deputed to present to the\r\nPrime Minister, Lord Grey, a petition from Nottingham for the\r\ndisestablishment of the Church of England. The Premier regretted that\r\nhe could not give his support to such a sweeping measure, which would\r\nembarrass the Ministry, alarm both Houses of Parliament, and startle\r\nthe nation. He declared his intention of standing by the Church to the\r\nbest of his ability, believing it to be the sacred duty of Government\r\nto maintain an establishment of religion. To which sturdy William\r\nHowitt replied that to establish one sect in preference to another was\r\nto establish a party and not a religion.\r\n\r\nCivic duties, together with the excitements of local politics, proved\r\na sad hindrance to literary work, and in 1836 the Howitts, who had\r\nlong been yearning for a wider intellectual sphere, decided to give up\r\nthe chemist's business, and settle in the neighbourhood of London.\r\nTheir friends, the Alaric Watts's, who were living at Thames Ditton,\r\nfound them a pretty little house at Esher, where they would be able to\r\nenjoy the woods and heaths of rural Surrey, and yet be within easy\r\nreach of publishers and editors in town. Before settling down in their\r\nnew home, the Howitts made a three months' tour in the north, with a\r\nview to gathering materials for William's book on _Rural\r\nEngland_. They explored the Yorkshire dales, stayed with the\r\nWordsworths at Rydal, and made a pilgrimage to the haunts of their\r\nfavourite, Thomas Bewick, in Northumberland. Crossing the Border they\r\npaid a delightful visit to Edinburgh, where they were made much of by\r\nthe three literary cliques of the city, the Blackwood and Wilson set,\r\nthe Tait set, and the Chambers set.\r\n\r\n'Immediately after our arrival,' relates Mary, 'a public dinner was\r\ngiven to Campbell the poet, at which the committee requested my\r\nhusband's attendance, and that he would take a share in the\r\nproceedings of the evening by proposing as a toast, \"Wordsworth,\r\nSouthey, and Moore.\" This was our first introduction to Professor\r\nWilson (Christopher North) and his family. I sat in the gallery with\r\nMrs. Wilson and her daughters, one of whom was engaged to Professor\r\nFerrier. We could not but remark the wonderful difference, not only in\r\nthe outer man, but in the whole character of mind and manner, between\r\nProfessor Wilson and Campbell--the one so hearty, outspoken, and\r\njoyous, the other so petty and trivial.'\r\n\r\nRobert Chambers constituted himself the Hewitts' cicerone in\r\nEdinburgh, showing them every place of interest, and presenting them\r\nto every person of note, including Mrs. Maclehose (the Clarinda of\r\nBurns), and William Miller, the Quaker artist and engraver, as intense\r\na nature-worshipper as themselves. From Edinburgh they went to\r\nGlasgow, where they took ship for the Western Isles. Their adventures\r\nat Staffa and Iona, their voyage up the Caledonian Canal, and the\r\nremainder of their experiences on this tour, were afterwards described\r\nby William Howitt in his _Visits to Remarkable Places_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1836, the Howitts took possession of their Surrey home,\r\nWest End Cottage, an old-fashioned dwelling, with a large garden, an\r\norchard, a meadow by the river Mole, and the right of boating and\r\nfishing to the extent of seven miles. The new life opened with good\r\nprospects of literary and journalistic employment, William Howitt's\r\npolitical writings having already attracted attention from several\r\npersons of power and influence in the newspaper world. On December 3\r\nof this year, Mary wrote to inform her sister that, 'In consequence of\r\nan article that William wrote on Dymond's _Christian Morality_,\r\nJoseph Hume, the member for Middlesex, wrote to him, and has opened a\r\nmost promising connection for him with a new Radical newspaper, _The\r\nConstitutional_. O'Connell seems determined to make him the editor\r\nof the _Dublin Review_, and wrote him a most kind letter, which\r\nhas naturally promoted his interest with the party. I cannot but see\r\nthe hand of Providence in our leaving Nottingham. All has turned out\r\nadmirably.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for these sanguine anticipations, the newspaper\r\nconnections on which the Howitts depended for a livelihood, now that\r\nthe despised chemist's business had been given up, proved but hollow\r\nsupports. O'Connell had overlooked the trifling fact that a Quaker\r\neditor was hardly fitted to conduct a journal that was emphatically\r\nand polemically Catholic; and though he considered that William Howitt\r\nwas admirably adapted to deal with literary and political topics, he\r\nwas obliged to withdraw his offer of the editorship. A more crushing\r\ndisappointment arose out of the engagement on _The Constitutional_.\r\nMr. Howitt, according to his wife, did more for the paper than any\r\nother member of the staff. 'He worked and wrote like any slave,'\r\nshe tells her sister. 'In the end, after a series of the most\r\nharassing and vexatious conduct on the part of the newspaper\r\ncompany, he was swindled out of every farthing. Oh, it was a most\r\nmortifying and humiliating thing to see men professing liberal and\r\nhonest principles act so badly. A month ago, when in the very depths\r\nof discouragement and low spirits, I set about a little volume for\r\nDarton, to be called _Birds and Flowers_, and have pretty nearly\r\nfinished it. William, in the mean time, has finished his _Rural\r\nLife_, and sold the first edition to Longman's.'\r\n\r\nThe manager of the unlucky paper was Major Carmichael Smith, who, when\r\nmatters grew desperate, sent for his step-son, Thackeray, then acting\r\nas Paris correspondent for a London daily. 'Just as I was going out of\r\nthe office one day,' writes William, 'I met on the stairs a tall, thin\r\nyoung man, in a dark blue coat, and with a nose that seemed to have\r\nhad a blow that had flattened the bridge. I turned back, and had some\r\nconversation with him, being anxious to know how he proposed to carry\r\non a paper which was without any funds, and already deeply in debt. He\r\ndid not seem to know any more than I did. I thought to myself that his\r\nstep-father had not done him much service in taking him from a\r\nprofitable post for the vain business of endeavouring to buoy up a\r\ndesperate speculation. How much longer _The Constitutional_\r\nstruggled on, I know not. That was the first time I ever saw or heard\r\nof William Makepeace Thackeray.'\r\n\r\nThe Howitts were somewhat consoled for their journalistic losses by\r\nthe triumphant success of _Rural Life in England_. The reading\r\npublic which, during the previous century, had swallowed mock\r\npastorals, made in Fleet Street, with perfect serenity, was now,\r\nthanks to the slowly-working influence of Wordsworth and the other\r\nLake poets, prepared for a renaissance of nature and simplicity in\r\nprose. Miss Mitford's exquisite work had given them a distaste for the\r\n'jewelled turf,' the 'silver streams,' and 'smiling valleys' which\r\nconstituted the rustic stock-in-trade of the average novelist; and\r\nthey eagerly welcomed a book that treated with accuracy and\r\nobservation of the real country. William Howitt's straightforward,\r\nundistinguished style was acceptable enough in an age when even men of\r\ngenius seem to have written fine prose without knowing it, and tripped\r\nup not infrequently over the subtleties of English grammar. His lack\r\nof imagination and humour was more than atoned for, in the uncritical\r\neyes of the 'thirties,' by the easy loquacity of his rural gossip, and\r\nthe varied information with which he crammed his pages. The Nature of\r\nthose days was a simple, transparent creature, with but small\r\nresemblance to the lady of moods, mystery, and passion who is so\r\noverworked in our modern literature. No one dreamt of going into\r\nhysterics over the veining of a leaf, or penning a rhapsody on the\r\noutline of a rain-cloud; nor could it yet be said that, 'if everybody\r\nmust needs blab of the favours that have been done him by roadside,\r\nand river-brink, and woodland walk, as if to kiss and tell were no\r\nlonger treachery, it will soon be a positive refreshment to meet a man\r\nwho is as superbly indifferent to Nature as she is to him.' [Footnote:\r\nLowell]\r\n\r\nThe Howitts took great delight in the pleasant Surrey country, so\r\ndifferent from the dreary scenery around Nottingham, and Mary's\r\nletters contain many descriptions of the woods and commons and shady\r\nlanes through which the family made long expeditions in a little\r\ncarriage drawn by Peg, their venerable pony. Driving one day to Hook,\r\nthey met Charles Dickens, then best known as 'Boz,' in one of his long\r\ntramps, with Harrison Ainsworth as his companion. When Dickens's next\r\nwork, _Master Humphrey's Clock_, appeared, the Howitts were\r\namused to see that their stout and wilful Peg had not escaped the\r\nnovelist's keen eye, but had been pressed into service for Mr.\r\nGarland's chaise.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, in July 1841, William, while driving with a\r\nfriend, was attacked by two handsome, dark-eyed girls, dressed in\r\ngipsy costume, who ran one on each side of the carriage, begging that\r\nthe kind gentleman would give them sixpence, as they were poor\r\nstrangers who had taken nothing all day. Mr. Howitt, who had made a\r\nspecial study of the gipsy tribe, perceived in an instant that these\r\nwere only sham Romanys. He paid no attention to their pleading, but\r\nobserved that he hoped they would enjoy their frolic, and only wished\r\nthat he were as rich as they. Subsequently, he discovered that the\r\nmock-gipsies, who had been unable to coax a sixpence out of him, were\r\nnone other than the beautiful Sheridan sisters, the Duchess of\r\nSomerset, and Mrs. Blackwood (afterwards Lady Dufferin), whose husband\r\nhad lately taken Bookham Lodge.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years spent at Esher, Mary seems to have been too much\r\noccupied with the cares of a young family to use her pen to much\r\npurpose. She produced little, except a volume of _Hymns and Fireside\r\nVerses_, but she frequently assisted her husband in his work.\r\nWilliam, industrious as ever, published, besides a large number of\r\nnewspaper articles, his _Boys' Country Book_, the best work of\r\nthe kind ever written, according to the _Quarterly Review_; and\r\nhis _History of Colonisation and Christianity_, in which he took\r\na rapid survey of the behaviour of the Christian nations of Europe to\r\nthe inhabitants of the countries they conquered in all parts of the\r\nworld. It was the reading of this book that led Mr. Joseph Pease to\r\nestablish the British India Society, which issued, in a separate form,\r\nthe portion of the work that related to India. Mr. Howitt next set to\r\nwork upon another topographical volume, his _Visits to Remarkable\r\nPlaces_, in which he turned to good account the materials collected\r\nin his pedestrian rambles about the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the question of education for the elder children became\r\nurgent, and the Howitts, who had heard much of the advantages of a\r\nresidence in Germany from their friends, Mrs. Hemans, Mrs. Jameson,\r\nand Henry Chorley, decided to give up their cottage at Esher, and\r\nspend two or three years at Heidelberg. Letters of introduction from\r\nMrs. Jameson gave them the _entrée_ into German society, which\r\nthey found more to their taste than that of their native land. 'For\r\nthe sake of our children,' writes Mary, 'we sought German\r\nacquaintances, we read German, we followed German customs. The life\r\nseemed to me easier, the customs simpler and less expensive than in\r\nEngland. There was not the same feverish thirst after wealth as with\r\nus; there was more calm appreciation of nature, of music, of social\r\nenjoyment.' In their home on the Neckar, the Howitts, most adaptable\r\nof couples, found new pleasures and new amusements with each season of\r\nthe year. In the spring and summer they explored the surrounding\r\ncountry, wandered through the deep valleys and woods, where the grass\r\nwas purple with bilberries, visited quaint, half-timbered homesteads,\r\nstanding in the midst of ancient orchards, or followed the\r\nswift-flowing streams, on whose banks the peasant girls in their\r\npicturesque costumes were washing and drying linen. In the autumn the\r\nwhole family turned out on the first day of the vintage, and worked\r\nlike their neighbours. 'It was like something Arcadian,' wrote Mary\r\nwhen recalling the scene. 'The tubs and baskets piled up with enormous\r\nclusters, the men and women carrying them away on their heads to the\r\nplace where they were being crushed; the laughter, the merriment, the\r\nfeasting, the firing--for they make as much noise as they can--all was\r\ndelightful, to say nothing of the masquerading and dancing in the\r\nevening, which we saw, though we did not take part in it.' In the\r\nwinter the strangers were introduced to the Christmas Tree, which had\r\nnot yet become a British institution: while with the first snow came\r\nthe joys of sleighing, when wheel-barrows, tubs, baskets, everything\r\nthat could be put on runners, were turned into sledges, and the boys\r\nwere in their glory.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years that were spent at Heidelberg, William\r\nHowitt wrote his _Student Life in Germany_, _German Experiences_,\r\nand _Rural and Domestic Life in Germany_, works which contain a\r\ngreat deal of more or less valuable information about the country and\r\nthe people, presented in a homely, unpretentious style. Mary was no\r\nless industrious, having struck a new literary vein, the success of\r\nwhich was far to surpass her modest anticipations. 'I have been very\r\nbusy,' she writes in 1842, 'translating the first volume of a charming\r\nwork by Frederica Bremer, a Swedish writer; and if any publisher will\r\ngive me encouragement to go on with it, I will soon complete the work.\r\nIt is one of a series of stories of everyday life in Sweden--a\r\nbeautiful book, full of the noblest moral lessons for every man and\r\nwoman.' In the summer of 1841 the Howitts, accompanied by their elder\r\ndaughter, Anna, made a long tour through Germany and Austria, in the\r\ncourse of which they collected materials for fresh works, and visited\r\nthe celebrities, literary and artistic, of the various cities that lay\r\nin their route. At Stuttgart they called on Gustav Schwab, the poet,\r\nand visited Dannecker's studio; at Tübingen they made the acquaintance\r\nof Uhland, and at Munich that of Kaulbach, then at the height of his\r\nfame. By way of Vienna and Prague they travelled to Dresden, where,\r\nthrough the good offices of Mrs. Jameson, they were received by Moritz\r\nRetzsch, whose _Outlines_ they had long admired. At Berlin they\r\nmade friends with Tieck, on whom the king had bestowed a pension and a\r\nhouse at Potsdam; while at Weimar they were entertained by Frau von\r\nGoethe, whose son, Wolfgang, had been one of their earliest\r\nacquaintances at Heidelberg. This interesting tour is described at\r\nlength in the _Rural and Domestic Life of Germany_.\r\n\r\nAnother year was spent at Heidelberg, but the difficulties of\r\narranging the business details of their work at such a distance from\r\npublishers and editors, brought the industrious couple back to London\r\nin the spring of 1843. 'On our return to England,' writes Mary, 'I was\r\nfull of energy and hope. Glowing with aspiration, and in enjoyment of\r\ngreat domestic happiness, I was anticipating a busy, perhaps\r\noverburdened, but, nevertheless, congenial life. It was to be one of\r\ndarkness, perplexity, discouragement.' The Howitts had scarcely\r\nentered into possession of a new house that they had taken at Clapton,\r\nwhen news came from Heidelberg, where the elder children had been left\r\nat school, that their second son, Claude, had developed alarming\r\nsymptoms of disease in the knee-joint. It was known that he had been\r\nslightly injured in play a few weeks before, but no danger had been\r\nanticipated. Mr. Howitt at once set out for Heidelberg, and returned\r\nwith the invalid, on whose case Liston was consulted. The great\r\nsurgeon counselled amputation, but to this the parents refused their\r\nconsent, except as a last resource. Various less heroic modes of\r\ntreatment were tried, but poor Claude faded away, and died in March,\r\n1844, aged only ten years and a half. This was the heaviest trial that\r\nthe husband and wife had yet experienced, for Claude had been a boy of\r\nbrilliant promise, whom they regarded as the flower of their flock.\r\nOnly a few months before his accident his mother had written in the\r\npride of her heart: 'Claude is the naughtiest of all the children, and\r\nyet the most gifted. He learns anything at a glance. Claude is born to\r\nbe fortunate; he is one that will make the family distinguished in the\r\nnext generation. He has an extraordinary faculty for telling stories,\r\neither of his own invention or of what he reads.'\r\n\r\nA lesser cause of trouble and anxiety arose out of the translation of\r\nMiss Bremer's novels. 'When we first translated _The Neighbours_,'\r\nwrites Mary, 'there was not a house in London that would undertake\r\nits publication. We published it and the other Bremer novels at our\r\nown risk, but such became the rage for them that our translations\r\nwere seized by a publisher, altered, and reissued as new ones.'\r\nThe success of these books was said to be greater than that of\r\nany series since the first appearance of the Waverley novels. Cheap\r\neditions were multiplied in the United States, and even the boys who\r\nhawked the books about the streets were to be seen deep in _The\r\nHome_ or _The H. Family_. In a letter to her sister written\r\nabout this time, Mary expatiates on the annoyance and loss caused by\r\nthese piracies. 'It is very mortifying,' she observes, 'because no one\r\nknew of these Swedish novels till we introduced them. It obliges us to\r\nhurry in all we do, and we must work almost day and night to get ours\r\nout in order that we may have some little chance.... We have embarked\r\na great deal of money in the publication, and the interference of the\r\nupstart London publisher is most annoying. Mlle. Bremer, however, has\r\nwritten a new novel, and sends it to us before publication. We began\r\nits translation this week, and hope to be able to publish it about the\r\ntime it will appear in Sweden and Germany.'\r\n\r\nIn addition to her translating work, Mrs. Howitt was engaged at this\r\ntime upon a series of little books, called _Tales for the People and\r\ntheir Children_, which had been commissioned by a cheap publisher.\r\nThese stories, each of which illustrated a domestic virtue, were\r\npunctually paid for: and though they were never advertised, they\r\npassed swiftly through innumerable editions, and have been popular\r\nwith a certain public down to quite recent times. Perhaps the most\r\nattractive is the _Autobiography of a Child_, in which Mary told\r\nthe story of her own early days in her pretty, simple style, with the\r\nmany little quaint touches that gave all her juvenile stories an\r\natmosphere of truth and reality. Her quick sympathy with young people,\r\nand her knowledge of what most appealed to the childish mind, was\r\nprobably due to her vivid remembrance of her own youthful days, and to\r\nher affectionate study of the 'little ways' of her own children. Many\r\nare the original traits and sayings that she reports to her sister,\r\nmore especially those of her youngest boy, Charlton, who had inherited\r\nhis parents' naturalistic tastes in a pronounced form, and preferred\r\nthe Quakers' meeting-house to any other church or chapel, because\r\nthere was a dog-kennel on the premises!\r\n\r\nAbout a year after her return to England, Mrs. Howitt turned her\r\nattention to Danish literature, finding that, with her knowledge of\r\nSwedish and German, the language presented few difficulties. In 1845\r\nshe translated Hans Andersen's _Impromsatore_, greatly to the\r\nsatisfaction of the author, who begged that she would continue to\r\ntranslate his works, till he was as well known and loved in England as\r\nhe was on the Continent. Appreciation, fame, and joy, declared the\r\ncomplacent poet, followed his footsteps wherever he went, and his\r\nwhole life was full of sunshine, like a beautiful fairy-tale. Mary\r\ntranslated his _Only a Fiddler_; _O. T., or Life in Denmark_;\r\n_The True Story of My Life_; and several of the _Wonderful Stories\r\nfor Children_. The _Improvisatore_ was the only one that went\r\ninto a second edition, the other works scarcely paying the cost\r\nof publication. Hans Andersen, however, being assured that Mrs.\r\nHowitt was making a fortune of the translations, came to England\r\nin 1847 to arrange for a share of the profits. Though disappointed\r\nin his hope of gain, he begged Mrs. Howitt to translate the whole\r\nof his fairy-tales, which had just been brought out in a\r\nbeautifully-illustrated German edition. Much to her after regret, she\r\nwas then too much engrossed by other work to be able to accede to his\r\nproposal. The relations between Hans Andersen and his translator were\r\nmarred, we are told, by the extreme sensitiveness and egoism of the\r\nDane. Mrs. Howitt narrates, as an example of his childish vanity, the\r\nfollowing little incident which occurred during his visit to England\r\nin the summer of 1847:--\r\n\r\n'We had taken him, as a pleasant rural experience, to the annual\r\nhay-making at Hillside, Highgate, thus introducing him to an English\r\nhome, full of poetry and art, sincerity, and affection. The ladies of\r\nHillside--Miss Mary and Margaret Gillies, the one an embodiment of\r\npeace and an admirable writer, whose talent, like the violet, kept in\r\nthe shade; the other, the warm-hearted painter--made him welcome....\r\nImmediately after our arrival, the assembled children, loving his\r\ndelightful fairy-tales, clustered round him in the hay-field, and\r\nwatched him make them a pretty device of flowers; then, feeling\r\nsomehow that the stiff, silent foreigner was not kindred to\r\nthemselves, stole off to an American, Henry Clarke Wright, whose\r\nadmirable little book, _A Kiss for a Blow_, some of them knew.\r\nHe, without any suggestion of condescension or difference of age,\r\nentered heart and soul into their glee, laughed, shouted, and played\r\nwith them, thus unconsciously evincing the gift which had made him\r\nearlier the exclusive pastor of six hundred children in Boston. Soon\r\npoor Andersen, perceiving himself neglected, complained of headache,\r\nand insisted on going indoors, whither Mary Gillies and I, both\r\nanxious to efface any disagreeable impression, accompanied him; but he\r\nremained irritable and out of sorts.'\r\n\r\nIt was in 1845 or 1846 that the Howitts made the acquaintance of\r\nTennyson, whose poetry they had long admired. 'The retiring and\r\nmeditative young poet, Alfred Tennyson, visited us,' relates Mary,\r\n'and cheered our seclusion by the recitation of his exquisite poetry.\r\nHe spent a Sunday night at our house, when we sat talking together\r\ntill three in the morning. All the next day he remained with us in\r\nconstant converse. We seemed to have known him for years. So in fact\r\nwe had, for his poetry was himself. He hailed all attempts at\r\nheralding a grander, more liberal state of public opinion, and\r\nconsequently sweeter, nobler modes of living. He wished that we\r\nEnglanders could dress up our affections in more poetical costume;\r\nreal warmth of heart would gain rather than lose by it. As it was, our\r\nmanners were as cold as the walls of our churches.' Another new friend\r\nwas gained through William Howitt's book, _Visits to Remarkable\r\nPlaces_. When the work was announced as 'in preparation,' the\r\nauthor received a letter, signed E. C. Gaskell, drawing his attention\r\nto a beautiful old house, Clopton Hall, near Stratford-on-Avon. The\r\nletter described in such admirable style the writer's visit to the\r\nhouse as a schoolgirl, that William wrote to suggest that she ought to\r\nuse her pen for the public benefit. This timely encouragement led to\r\nthe production of _Mary Barton_, the first volume of which was\r\nsent in manuscript for Mr. Howitt's verdict. A few months later Mrs.\r\nGaskell came as a guest to the little house at Clopton, bringing with\r\nher the completed work.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 William Howitt took part in a new journalistic venture, his\r\nwife, as usual, sharing his labours and anxieties. He became first\r\ncontributor, and afterwards editor and part-proprietor of the\r\n_People's Journal_, a cheap weekly, through the medium of which\r\nhe hoped to improve the moral and intellectual condition of the\r\nworking classes. 'The bearing of its contents,' wrote Mary, in answer\r\nto some adverse criticism of the new paper, 'is love to God and man.\r\nThere is no attempt to set the poor against the rich, but, on the\r\ncontrary, to induce them to be careful, prudent, sober and\r\nindependent; above all, to be satisfied to be workers, and to regard\r\nlabour as a privilege rather than as a penalty, which is quite our\r\nview of the matter.' The combination of business and philanthropy\r\nseldom answers, and the Howitts, despite the excellence of their\r\nintentions, were unlucky in their newspaper speculations. At the end\r\nof a few months it was discovered that the manager of the _People's\r\nJournal_ kept no books, and that the affairs of the paper were in\r\nhopeless confusion. William Howitt, finding himself responsible for\r\nthe losses on the venture, tried to cure the evil by a hair of the dog\r\nthat had bitten him. He withdrew from the _People's Journal_,\r\nand, with Samuel Smiles as his assistant, started a rival paper on the\r\nsame lines, called _Howitts Journal_. But, as Ebenezer Elliott,\r\nthe shrewd old Quaker, remarked, apropos of the apathy of the\r\nworking-class public: 'Men engaged in a death struggle for bread will\r\npay for amusement when they will not for instruction. They woo\r\nlaughter to unscare them, that they may forget their perils, their\r\nwrongs, and their oppressors. If you were able and willing to fill the\r\njournal with fun, it would pay.' The failure of his paper spelt ruin\r\nto its promoter; his copyrights, as well as those of his wife, were\r\nsacrificed, and he was obliged to begin the world anew.\r\n\r\nThe Howitts seem to have kept up their spirits bravely under this\r\nreverse, and never for a moment relaxed in their untiring industry.\r\nThey moved into a small house in Avenue Road, St. John's Wood, and\r\nlooked around them for new subjects upon which to exercise their\r\nwell-worn pens. Mary hoped to get employment from the Religious Tract\r\nSociety, which had invited her to send in a specimen story, but she\r\nfeared that her work would hardly be considered sufficiently orthodox,\r\nthough she had introduced one of the 'death-bed scenes,' which were\r\nthen in so much request. As she anticipated, the story was returned as\r\nquite unsuitable, and thereupon she writes to her sister in some\r\ndepression: 'Times are so bad that publishers will not speculate in\r\nbooks; and when I have finished the work I am now engaged on, I have\r\nnothing else certain to go on with.' However, writers so popular with\r\nthe public as the Howitts were not likely to be left long without\r\nemployment. Mary seems to have been the greater favourite of the two,\r\nand the vogue of her volume of collected _Poems and Ballads_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1847, strikes the modern reader with amazement. Some\r\nidea of the estimation in which she was then held is proved by Allan\r\nCunningham's dictum that 'Mary Howitt has shown herself mistress of\r\nevery string of the minstrel's lyre, save that which sounds of broil\r\nand bloodshed. There is more of the old ballad simplicity in her\r\ncomposition than can be found in the strains of any living poet\r\nbesides.' Another critic compared Mrs. Hewitt's ballads to those of\r\nLord Macaulay, while Mrs. Alaric Watts, in her capacity of Annual\r\neditor, wrote to assure her old friend and contributor that, 'In thy\r\nsimplest poetry there are sometimes turns so exquisite as to bring the\r\ntears to my eyes. Thou hast as much poetry in thee as would set up\r\nhalf-a-dozen writers.' The one dissentient voice among admiring\r\ncontemporaries is that of Miss Mitford, who writes in 1852: 'I am for\r\nmy sins so fidgety respecting style that I have the bad habit of\r\nexpecting a book that pretends to be written in our language to be\r\nEnglish; therefore I cannot read Miss Strickland, or the Howitts, or\r\nCarlyle, or Emerson, or the serious parts of Dickens.' It must be\r\nowned that the Howitts are condemned in fairly good company.\r\n\r\nThe work of both husband and wife suffered from the inevitable defects\r\nof self-education, and also from the narrowness and seclusion of their\r\nearly lives. Mary possessed more imagination and a lighter touch than\r\nher husband, but her attempts at adult fiction were hampered by her\r\nignorance of the world, while her technique, both in prose and verse,\r\nleft something to be desired. It is evident that the publishers and\r\neditors of the period were less critical than Miss Mitford, for, in\r\n1848, we find that Mrs. Howitt was invited to write the opening volume\r\nof Bradshaw's series of Railway novels, while in February 1850, came a\r\nrequest from Charles Dickens for contributions to _Household\r\nWords_. 'You may have seen,' he writes, 'the first dim announcements\r\nof the new, cheap literary journal I am about to start. Frankly, I\r\nwant to say to you that if you would write for it, you would delight\r\nme, and I should consider myself very fortunate indeed in enlisting\r\nyour services.... I hope any connection with the enterprise would\r\nbe satisfactory and agreeable to you in all respects, as I should\r\nmost earnestly endeavour to make it. If I wrote a book I could\r\nsay no more than I mean to suggest to you in these few lines.\r\nAll that I leave unsaid, I leave to your generous understanding.'\r\n\r\nThe Howitts were keenly interested in the gradual awakening of the\r\nlong-dormant, artistic instincts of the nation, the first signs of\r\nwhich became faintly visible about the end of the forties. 'Down to\r\nthat time,' observes Mary, 'the taste of the English people had been\r\nfor what appealed to the mind rather than to the eye, and the general\r\npublic were almost wholly uneducated in art. By 1849 the improvement\r\ndue to the exertions of the Prince Consort, the Society of Arts, and\r\nother powers began to be felt; while a wonderful impulse to human\r\ntaste and ingenuity was being given in the preparation of exhibits for\r\nthe World's Fair.' The gentle Quakeress who, in her youth, had\r\nmodelled Wedgwood figures in paper pulp, and clapped her\r\nclear-starching to the rhythm of _Lalla Rookh_, was, in middle\r\nlife, one of the staunchest supporters of the Pre-Raphaelite Brethren,\r\nand that at a time when the President of the Royal Academy had\r\nannounced his intention of hanging no more of their 'outrageous\r\nproductions.' Through their friend, Edward La Trobe Bateman, the\r\nHowitts had been introduced into the Pre-Raphaelite circle, and\r\nfamiliarised with the then new and startling idea that artistic\r\nprinciples might be carried out in furniture and house-decoration.\r\nLess than three-quarters of a century before, Mary's father had been\r\nsternly rebuked by her grandfather for painting a series of lines in\r\nblack and grey above the parlour fireplace to represent a cornice.\r\nThis primitive attempt at decoration was regarded as a sinful\r\nindulgence of the lust of the eye! With the simple charity that was\r\ncharacteristic of them, William and Mary saw only the best side of\r\ntheir new friends, the shadows of Bohemian life being entirely hidden\r\nfrom them. 'Earnest and severe in their principles of art,' observes\r\nMrs. Howitt naively, 'the young reformers indulged in much jocundity\r\nwhen the day's work was done. They were wont to meet at ten, cut\r\njokes, talk slang, smoke, read poetry, and discuss art till three\r\nA.M.'\r\n\r\nThe couple had by this time renounced their membership of the Society\r\nof Friends, but they had not joined any other religious sect, though\r\nthey seem to have been attracted by Unitarian doctrines. 'Mere\r\ncreeds,' wrote Mary to her sister, 'matter nothing to me. I could go\r\none Sunday to the Church of England, another to a Catholic chapel, a\r\nthird to the Unitarian, and so on; and in each of them find my heart\r\nwarmed with Christian love to my fellow-creatures, and lifted up with\r\ngratitude and praise to God.' For many years the house in Avenue Road\r\nwas, we are told, a meeting-place for all that was best and brightest\r\nin the world of modern thought and art. William Howitt was always\r\nready to lend an attentive and unbiassed ear to the newest theory, or\r\neven the newest fad, while Mary possessed in the fullest degree the\r\ngift of companionableness, and her inexhaustible sympathy drew from\r\nothers an instant confidence. Her arduous literary labours never\r\nimpaired her vigorous powers of mind or body, and she often wrote till\r\nlate into the night without appearing to suffer in either health or\r\nspirits. She is described as a careful and energetic housewife;\r\nindeed, her husband was accustomed to say that he would challenge any\r\nwoman who never wrote a line, to match his own good woman in the\r\nmanagement of a large household.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 came the first tidings of the discovery of gold in Australia,\r\nand nothing was talked of but this new Eldorado and the wonderful\r\ninducements held out to emigrants. William Howitt, who felt that he\r\nneeded a change from brain-work, suddenly resolved on a trip with his\r\ntwo sons to this new world, where he would see his youngest brother,\r\nDr. Godfrey Howitt, who had settled at Melbourne. He was also anxious\r\nto ascertain what openings in the country there might be for his boys,\r\nboth of whom had active, outdoor tastes, which there seemed little\r\nchance of their being able to gratify in England. In June, 1852, the\r\nthree male members of the family, accompanied by La Trobe Bateman,\r\nsailed for Australia, while Mary and her two daughters, the elder of\r\nwhom had just returned from a year in Kaulbach's studio at Munich,\r\nmoved into a cottage called the Hermitage, at Highgate, which belonged\r\nto Mr. Bateman, and had formerly been occupied by Rossetti. Here they\r\nlived quietly for upwards of two years, working at their literary or\r\nartistic occupations, and seeing a few intimate friends. Mary kept her\r\nhusband posted up in the events that were taking place in England, and\r\nwe learn from her letters what were the chief topics of town talk in\r\nthe early fifties.\r\n\r\n'Now, I must think over what news there is,' she writes in April,\r\n1853. 'In the political world, the proposed new scheme of Property and\r\nIncome Tax, which would make everybody pay something; and the proposal\r\nfor paying off a portion of the National Debt with Australian gold. In\r\nthe literary world, the International Copyright, which some expect\r\nwill be in force in three months. In society in general, the strange\r\ncircumstantial rumour of the Queen's death, which, being set afloat on\r\nEaster Monday, when no business was doing, was not the offspring of\r\nthe money market. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean, who were here the other\r\nday, spoke of it, saying truly that for the moment it seemed to\r\nparalyse the very heart of England.... [May 4th.] The great talk now\r\nis Mrs. Beecher Stowe and spirit-rapping, both of which have arrived\r\nin England. The universality of the latter phenomena renders it a\r\ncurious study. A feeling seems pervading all classes and all sects\r\nthat the world stands on the brink of some great spiritual revelation.\r\nIt meets one in books, in newspapers, on the lips of members of the\r\nChurch of England, Unitarians, and even Freethinkers. Poor old Robert\r\nOwen, the philanthropist, has been converted, and made a confession of\r\nfaith in public. One cannot but respect a man who, in his old age, has\r\nthe boldness to declare himself as having been blinded and mistaken\r\nthrough life.'\r\n\r\nIn December, 1854, William Howitt returned from his travels without\r\nany gold in his pockets, but with the materials for his _History of\r\nDiscovery in Australia and New Zealand._ Thanks to what he used to\r\ncall his four great doctors, Temperance, Exercise, Good Air, and Good\r\nHours, he had displayed wonderful powers of activity and endurance\r\nduring his exploration of some almost untracked regions of the new\r\nworld. At sixty years of age he had marched twenty miles a day under a\r\nblazing sun for weeks at a time, worked at digging gold for twelve\r\nhours a day, waded through rivers, slept under trees, baked his own\r\nbread, washed his own clothes, and now returned in the pink of\r\ncondition, with his passion for wandering only intensified by his\r\nthree years of an adventurous life. The family experiences were\r\ndiversified thenceforward by frequent change of scene, for William was\r\nalways ready and willing to start off at a moment's notice to the\r\nmountains, the seaside, or the Continent. But whether the Howitts were\r\nat home or abroad, they continued their making of many books, so that\r\nit becomes difficult for the biographer to keep pace with their\r\nliterary output. Together or separately they produced a _History of\r\nScandinavian Literature, The Homes and Haunts of the Poets, a Popular\r\nHistory of England_, which was published in weekly parts, a\r\n_Year-Book of the Country_, a _Popular History of the United\r\nStates_, a _History of the Supernatural_, the _Northern Heights\r\nof London_, and an abridged edition of _Sir Charles Grandison_,\r\nbesides several tales for young people, and contributions to\r\nmagazines and newspapers.\r\n\r\nEven increasing age had no power to narrow their point of view, or to\r\nblunt their sympathy with every movement that seemed to make for the\r\nrelief of the oppressed, the welfare of the nation, or the advancement\r\nof the human race. Just as in youth they had championed the cause of\r\nCatholic Emancipation and of political Reform, so in later years we\r\nfind them advocating the Repeal of the Corn Laws, taking part in the\r\nAnti-Slavery agitation, working for improvement in the laws that\r\naffected women and children, and supporting the Bill for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals. A more debatable subject--that of\r\nspiritualism--was investigated by them in a friendly but impartial\r\nspirit. 'In the spring of 1856, 'writes Mrs. Howitt, 'we had become\r\nacquainted with several most ardent and honest spirit mediums. It\r\nseemed right to my husband and myself to try and understand the nature\r\nof these phenomena in which our new acquaintance so firmly believed.\r\nIn the month of April I was invited to attend a _séance_ at\r\nProfessor de Morgan's, and was much astonished and affected by\r\ncommunications purporting to come to me from my dear son Claude. With\r\nconstant prayer for enlightenment and guidance, we experimented at\r\nhome. The teachings that seemed given us from the spirit-world were\r\noften akin to those of the gospel; at other times they were more\r\nobviously emanations of evil. I felt thankful for the assurance thus\r\ngained of an invisible world, but resolved to neglect none of my\r\ncommon duties for spiritualism.' Among the Hewitts' fellow-converts\r\nwere Robert Chambers, Robert Owen, the Carter Halls and the Alaric\r\nWatts's; while Sir David Brewster and Lord Brougham were earnest\r\ninquirers into these forms of psychical phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 William Howitt was granted a pension by Government, and a year\r\nlater the couple moved from Highgate to a cottage called the Orchard,\r\nnear their former residence at Esher. Of their four surviving\r\nchildren, only Margaret, the youngest, was left at home. Anna, already\r\nthe author of a very interesting book, _An Art Student at\r\nMunich_, had, as her mother observes, taken her place among the\r\nsuccessful artists and writers of her day, 'when, in the spring of\r\n1856, a severe private censure of one of her oil-paintings by a king\r\namong critics so crushed her sensitive nature, as to make her yield to\r\nher bias for the supernatural, and withdraw from the arena of the fine\r\narts.' In 1857 Anna became the wife of Alfred Watts, the son of her\r\nparents' old friends, Alaric and Zillah Watts. The two boys, Alfred\r\nand Charlton, born explorers and naturalists, both settled in\r\nAustralia. Alfred, early in the sixties, had explored the district of\r\nLake Torrens, a land of parched deserts, dry-water-courses, and\r\nsoda-springs, whose waters effervesced tartaric acid; and had opened\r\nup for the Victorian Government the mountainous district of Gippsland,\r\nwith the famous gold-field of the Crooked River. In 1861 he had been\r\nemployed to head the relief-party that went in search of the\r\ndiscoverer, Robert O'Hara Burke, and his companions, and a year later\r\nhe brought back the remains of the ill-fated explorers to Melbourne\r\nfor public burial. Later in life he was successfully employed in\r\nvarious Government enterprises, and published, in collaboration with a\r\nfriend, a learned work on the aborigines of Australia.\r\n\r\nCharlton Howitt, the younger son, after five years' uncongenial work\r\nin a London office, emigrated to Australia in 1860. His quality was\r\nquickly recognised by the Provincial Government, which, in 1862,\r\nappointed him to command an expedition to examine the rivers in the\r\nprovince of Canterbury, with a view to ascertaining whether they\r\ncontained gold. So admirably was the work accomplished that, on his\r\nreturn to Christchurch, he was intrusted with the task of opening up\r\ncommunications between the Canterbury plains and the newly-discovered\r\ngold and coal district on the west coast. 'This duty was faithfully\r\nperformed, under constant hardships and discouragement,' relates his\r\nmother. 'But a few miles of road remained to be cut, when, at the end\r\nof June, 1863, after personally rescuing other pioneers and wanderers\r\nfrom drowning and starvation in that watery, inhospitable forest\r\nregion, Charlton, with two of his men, went down in the deep waters of\r\nLake Brunner; a fatal accident which deprived the Government of a\r\nvalued servant, and saddened the hearts of all who knew him.'\r\n\r\nAfter four peaceful years at Esher, the _Wanderlust_, that gipsy\r\nspirit, which not even the burden of years could tame, took possession\r\nof William and Mary once more, and they suddenly decided that they\r\nmust see Italy before they died. In May, 1870, they let the Orchard,\r\nand, aged seventy-seven and seventy-one respectively, set out on their\r\nlast long flight into the world. The summer was spent on the Lake of\r\nLucerne, where the old-world couple came across that modern of the\r\nmoderns, Richard Wagner, and his family. By way of the Italian Lakes\r\nand Venice they travelled, in leisurely fashion, to Rome, where they\r\ncelebrated their golden wedding in April, 1871. The Eternal City threw\r\nits glamour around these ancient pilgrims, who found both life and\r\nclimate exactly suited to the needs of old age. 'I prized in Rome,'\r\nwrites Mrs. Howitt, 'the many kind and sympathetic friends that were\r\ngiven to us, the ease of social existence, the poetry, the classic\r\ngrace, the peculiar and deep pathos diffused around; above all, the\r\nstirring and affecting historic memories.... From the period of\r\narrival in Rome, I may truly say that the promise in Scripture, \"At\r\nevening time there shall be light,\" was, in our case, fulfilled.'\r\n\r\nThe simple, homely life of the aged couple continued unbroken amid\r\ntheir new surroundings. William interested himself in the planting of\r\nEucalyptus in the Campagna, as a preventive against malaria, and had\r\nseeds of different varieties sent over from Australia, which he\r\npresented to the Trappist monks of the Tre Fontani. He helped to\r\nestablish a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, and\r\nstruck up a friendship with the gardeners and custodians of the\r\nPincio, to whom he gave expert advice on the subject of the creatures\r\nunder their charge. The summer months were always spent in the Tyrol,\r\nwhere the Howitts had permanent quarters in an old mansion near\r\nBruneck, called Mayr-am-Hof. Here William was able to indulge in his\r\nfavourite occupation of gardening. He dug indefatigably in a field\r\nallotment with his English spade, a unique instrument in that land of\r\nclumsy husbandry, and was amazed at the growth of the New Zealand\r\nspinach, the widespread rhubarb, the exuberant tomatoes, and towering\r\nspikes of Indian corn. Thanks to the four great doctors before\r\nmentioned, he remained hale and hearty up to December, 1878, in which\r\nmonth he celebrated his eighty-seventh birthday. A few weeks later he\r\nwas attacked by bronchitis, which, owing to an unsuspected weakness of\r\nthe heart, he was unable to throw off. He died in his house on the Via\r\nSistina, close to his favourite Pincio, on March 3, 1879.\r\n\r\nMrs. Howitt now finally gave up the idea of returning to end her days\r\nin England. Her husband and companion of more than fifty years was\r\nburied in the Protestant Cemetery at Home, and when her time came, she\r\ndesired to be laid by his side. The grant of a small pension added to\r\nthe comfort of her last years, and was a source of much innocent pride\r\nand gratification, for, as she tells her daughter Anna, 'It was so\r\nreadily given, so kindly, so graciously, for my literary merits, by\r\nLord Beaconsfield, without the solicitation or interference of any\r\nfriend or well-wisher.' In May, 1880, she writes to a friend from\r\nMeran about 'a project, which seems to have grown up in a wonderful\r\nway by itself, or as if invisible hands had been arranging it; that we\r\nshould have a little home of our own _im heiligen Land Tirol_.\r\nThis really is a very great mercy, seeing that the Tyrol is so\r\nbeautiful, the climate so beneficial to health, and the people, taken\r\nas a whole, so very honest and devout. Our little nest of love, which\r\nwe shall call \"Marienruhe,\" will be perched on a hill with beautiful\r\nviews, surrounded by a small garden.' On September 29, 1881, Mrs.\r\nHowitt and her daughter, Margaret, slept, for the first time, in their\r\nromantically-situated new home near Meran.\r\n\r\nAt Marienruhe, the greater portion of the last seven years of Mary\r\nHowitt's life was spent in peace and contentment. Here she amused\r\nherself with writing her 'Reminiscences' for _Good Words_, which\r\nwere afterwards incorporated in her _Autobiography_. Age had no\r\npower to blunt her interest in the events of the day, political or\r\nliterary, and at eighty-seven we find her reading with keen enjoyment\r\nFroude's _Oceana_ and Besant's _All Sorts and Conditions of\r\nMen_, books that dealt with questions which she and her husband had\r\nhad at heart for the best part of a lifetime, and for which they had\r\nworked with untiring zeal. Of the first she writes to a friend: 'We\r\nmuch approve of his (Froude's) very strong desire that our colonies\r\nshould, like good, faithful, well-trained children, be staunch in love\r\nand service to old Mother England. How deeply we feel on this subject\r\nI cannot tell you; and I hope and trust that you join strongly in this\r\ntruly English sentiment.' Of the second she writes to Mrs. Leigh\r\nSmith: 'I am more interested than I can tell you in _All Sorts and\r\nConditions of Men_. It affects me like the perfected fruit of some\r\nglorious tree which my dear husband and I had a dim dream of planting\r\nmore than thirty years ago, and which we did, in our ignorance and\r\nincapacity, attempt to plant in soil not properly prepared, and far\r\ntoo early in the season. I cannot tell you how it has recalled the\r\nhopes and dreams of a time which, by the overruling Providence of God,\r\nwas so disastrous to us. It is a beautiful essay on the dignity of\r\nlabour.'\r\n\r\nThe last few years of Mary Howitt's life were saddened by the deaths\r\nof her beloved sister, Anna, and her elder daughter, Mrs. Watts, but\r\nsuch blows are softened for aged persons by the consciousness that\r\ntheir own race is nearly run. Mary had, moreover, one great spiritual\r\nconsolation in her conversion, at the age of eighty-three, to the\r\ndoctrines of Roman Catholicism In spite of her oft-repeated\r\nprotestations against the likelihood of her 'going over,' in spite of\r\nher declaration, openly expressed as late as 1871, that she firmly\r\nbelieved in the anti-Christianity of the Papacy, and that she and her\r\nhusband were watching with interest the progress of events which, they\r\ntrusted, would bring about its downfall, Mrs. Howitt was baptized into\r\nthe Roman Church in May, 1882. Her new faith was a source of intense\r\nhappiness to the naturally religious woman, who had found no refuge in\r\nany sectarian fold since her renunciation of her childish creed. In\r\n1888, the year of the Papal Jubilee, though her strength was already\r\nfailing, she was well enough to join the deputation of English\r\npilgrims, who, on January 10, were presented to the Pope by the Duke\r\nof Norfolk. In describing the scene, the last public ceremony in which\r\nshe took part, she writes: 'A serene happiness, almost joy, filled my\r\nwhole being as I found myself on my knees before the Vicar of Christ.\r\nMy wish was to kiss his foot, but it was withdrawn, and his hand given\r\nto me. You may think with what fervour I kissed the ring. In the\r\nmeantime he had been told my age and my late conversion. His hands\r\nwere laid on my shoulders, and, again and again, his right hand in\r\nblessing on my head, whilst he spoke to me of Paradise.'\r\n\r\nHaving thus achieved her heart's desire, it seemed as if the last tie\r\nwhich bound the aged convert to earth was broken. A few days later she\r\nwas attacked by bronchitis, and, after a short illness, passed away in\r\nher sleep on January 30, 1888, having nearly completed her\r\neighty-ninth year. To the last, we are told, Mary Howitt's sympathy\r\nwas as warm, her intelligence as keen as in the full vigour of life,\r\nwhile her rare physical strength and pliant temper preserved her in\r\nunabated enjoyment of existence to the verge of ninety. Although many\r\nof her books were out of print at the time of her death, it was said\r\nthat if every copy had been destroyed, most of her ballads and minor\r\npoems could have been collected from the memories of her admirers, who\r\nhad them--very literally--by heart.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Mary Howitt, it may be observed in conclusion, though not\r\nleaders, were brave soldiers in the army of workers for humanity, and\r\nif now they seem likely to share the common lot of the rank and\r\nfile--oblivion--it must be remembered that they were among those\r\nfavoured of the gods who are crowned with gratitude, love, and\r\nadmiration by their contemporaries. To them, asleep in their Roman\r\ngrave, the neglect of posterity brings no more pain than the homage of\r\nmodern critics brings triumph to the slighted poet who shares their\r\nlast resting-place.",
