OF PUBLIC DEBTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND PLAN OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it\r\n      with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it annually\r\n      consumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that\r\n      labour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations.\r\n\r\n      According, therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it, bears\r\n      a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume\r\n      it, the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries\r\n      and conveniencies for which it has occasion.\r\n\r\n      But this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different\r\n      circumstances: first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its\r\n      labour is generally applied; and, secondly, by the proportion between the\r\n      number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who\r\n      are not so employed. Whatever be the soil, climate, or extent of territory\r\n      of any particular nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply\r\n      must, in that particular situation, depend upon those two circumstances.\r\n\r\n      The abundance or scantiness of this supply, too, seems to depend more upon\r\n      the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter. Among the\r\n      savage nations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to\r\n      work is more or less employed in useful labour, and endeavours to provide,\r\n      as well as he can, the necessaries and conveniencies of life, for himself,\r\n      and such of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or\r\n      too infirm, to go a-hunting and fishing. Such nations, however, are so\r\n      miserably poor, that, from mere want, they are frequently reduced, or at\r\n      least think themselves reduced, to the necessity sometimes of directly\r\n      destroying, and sometimes of abandoning their infants, their old people,\r\n      and those afflicted with lingering diseases, to perish with hunger, or to\r\n      be devoured by wild beasts. Among civilized and thriving nations, on the\r\n      contrary, though a great number of people do not labour at all, many of\r\n      whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times, more\r\n      labour than the greater part of those who work; yet the produce of the\r\n      whole labour of the society is so great, that all are often abundantly\r\n      supplied; and a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order, if he is\r\n      frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and\r\n      conveniencies of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\r\n\r\n      The causes of this improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the\r\n      order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the\r\n      different ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject of\r\n      the first book of this Inquiry.\r\n\r\n      Whatever be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with\r\n      which labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its\r\n      annual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon the\r\n      proportion between the number of those who are annually employed in useful\r\n      labour, and that of those who are not so employed. The number of useful\r\n      and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in\r\n      proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting\r\n      them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The\r\n      second book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the\r\n      manner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different\r\n      quantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different\r\n      ways in which it is employed.\r\n\r\n      Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in\r\n      the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the\r\n      general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been\r\n      equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some\r\n      nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the\r\n      country; that of others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has\r\n      dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the\r\n      down-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more\r\n      favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns,\r\n      than to agriculture, the Industry of the country. The circumstances which\r\n      seem to have introduced and established this policy are explained in the\r\n      third book.\r\n\r\n      Though those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the\r\n      private interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any\r\n      regard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare of\r\n      the society; yet they have given occasion to very different theories of\r\n      political economy; of which some magnify the importance of that industry\r\n      which is carried on in towns, others of that which is carried on in the\r\n      country. Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon\r\n      the opinions of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of princes\r\n      and sovereign states. I have endeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain\r\n      as fully and distinctly as I can those different theories, and the\r\n      principal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations.\r\n\r\n      To explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the\r\n      people, or what has been the nature of those funds, which, in different\r\n      ages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of\r\n      these four first books. The fifth and last book treats of the revenue of\r\n      the sovereign, or commonwealth. In this book I have endeavoured to shew,\r\n      first, what are the necessary expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth;\r\n      which of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution\r\n      of the whole society, and which of them, by that of some particular part\r\n      only, or of some particular members of it: secondly, what are the\r\n      different methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute\r\n      towards defraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society, and what\r\n      are the principal advantages and inconveniencies of each of those methods;\r\n      and, thirdly and lastly, what are the reasons and causes which have\r\n      induced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this\r\n      revenue, or to contract debts; and what have been the effects of those\r\n      debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of\r\n      the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\nOF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE\r\nPRODUCTIVE POWERS OF LABOUR, AND OF THE ORDER ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS\r\nNATURALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the\r\n      greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is\r\n      anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the\r\n      division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general\r\n      business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in\r\n      what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly\r\n      supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps\r\n      that it really is carried further in them than in others of more\r\n      importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to\r\n      supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number\r\n      of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\r\n      different branch of the work can often be collected into the same\r\n      workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.\r\n\r\n      In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply\r\n      the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of\r\n      the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to\r\n      collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one\r\n      time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such\r\n      manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much\r\n      greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the\r\n      division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less\r\n      observed.\r\n\r\n      To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one\r\n      in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the\r\n      trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the\r\n      division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the\r\n      use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same\r\n      division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps,\r\n      with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not\r\n      make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not\r\n      only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number\r\n      of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One\r\n      man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth\r\n      points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make\r\n      the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a\r\n      peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\r\n      itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a\r\n      pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,\r\n      which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though\r\n      in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have\r\n      seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,\r\n      and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct\r\n      operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but\r\n      indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when\r\n      they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a\r\n      day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling\r\n      size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of\r\n      forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth\r\n      part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\r\n      thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought\r\n      separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated\r\n      to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made\r\n      twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two\r\n      hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part\r\n      of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a\r\n      proper division and combination of their different operations.\r\n\r\n      In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour\r\n      are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of\r\n      them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so\r\n      great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far\r\n      as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable\r\n      increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different\r\n      trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in\r\n      consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried\r\n      furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\r\n      improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,\r\n      being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved\r\n      society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,\r\n      nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce\r\n      any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great\r\n      number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of\r\n      the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the\r\n      wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\r\n      dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit\r\n      of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one\r\n      business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so\r\n      entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the\r\n      trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The\r\n      spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the\r\n      ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the\r\n      corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of\r\n      labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible\r\n      that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This\r\n      impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the\r\n      different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the\r\n      reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this\r\n      art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The\r\n      most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in\r\n      agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more\r\n      distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\r\n      lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\r\n      bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\r\n      fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much\r\n      more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In\r\n      agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more\r\n      productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more\r\n      productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich\r\n      country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come\r\n      cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same\r\n      degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the\r\n      superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of\r\n      France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly\r\n      about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\r\n      improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of\r\n      England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the\r\n      corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of\r\n      Poland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of\r\n      its cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and\r\n      goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its\r\n      manufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and\r\n      situation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper\r\n      than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the\r\n      present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well\r\n      suit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the\r\n      coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of\r\n      France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In Poland\r\n      there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\r\n      coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\r\n      subsist.\r\n\r\n      This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the\r\n      division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,\r\n      is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of\r\n      dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time\r\n      which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another;\r\n      and, lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which\r\n      facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.\r\n\r\n      First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily\r\n      increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of\r\n      labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and\r\n      by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily\r\n      increases very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who,\r\n      though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails,\r\n      if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will\r\n      scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in\r\n      a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to\r\n      make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a\r\n      nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight\r\n      hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under\r\n      twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of\r\n      making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of\r\n      them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of\r\n      a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same\r\n      person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion,\r\n      heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head,\r\n      too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into\r\n      which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of\r\n      them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it\r\n      has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The\r\n      rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are\r\n      performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen\r\n      them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost\r\n      in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we\r\n      should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very\r\n      quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a\r\n      different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who\r\n      cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from\r\n      his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades\r\n      can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt,\r\n      much less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man\r\n      commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment\r\n      to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and\r\n      hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he\r\n      rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and\r\n      of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\r\n      necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change\r\n      his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty\r\n      different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always\r\n      slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the\r\n      most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in\r\n      point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the\r\n      quantity of work which he is capable of performing.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is\r\n      facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is\r\n      unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the\r\n      invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and\r\n      abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.\r\n      Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of\r\n      attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed\r\n      towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great\r\n      variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the\r\n      whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some\r\n      one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that\r\n      some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of\r\n      labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their\r\n      own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement.\r\n      A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which\r\n      labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\r\n      workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\r\n      naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier\r\n      methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such\r\n      manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which\r\n      were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken\r\n      their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was\r\n      the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed\r\n      to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the\r\n      cylinder, according as the piston either ascended or descended. One of\r\n      those boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying\r\n      a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to\r\n      another part of the machine, the valve would open and shut without his\r\n      assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his\r\n      play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\r\n      this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the\r\n      discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour.\r\n\r\n      All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the\r\n      inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many\r\n      improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the\r\n      machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and\r\n      some by that of those who are called philosophers, or men of speculation,\r\n      whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, and\r\n      who, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers\r\n      of the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society,\r\n      philosophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the\r\n      principal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens.\r\n      Like every other employment, too, it is subdivided into a great number of\r\n      different branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe\r\n      or class of philosophers; and this subdivision of employment in\r\n      philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves dexterity, and\r\n      saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own peculiar\r\n      branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science is\r\n      considerably increased by it.\r\n\r\n      It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different\r\n      arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a\r\n      well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the\r\n      lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own\r\n      work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every\r\n      other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to\r\n      exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or, what\r\n      comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He\r\n      supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they\r\n      accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general\r\n      plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society.\r\n\r\n      Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a\r\n      civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of\r\n      people, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been\r\n      employed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The\r\n      woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and\r\n      rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great\r\n      multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the\r\n      wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver,\r\n      the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different\r\n      arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants\r\n      and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the\r\n      materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very\r\n      distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in\r\n      particular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers,\r\n      must have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs\r\n      made use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the\r\n      world? What a variety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the\r\n      tools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated\r\n      machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the\r\n      loom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labour is\r\n      requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which\r\n      the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for\r\n      smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to\r\n      be made use of in the smelting-house, the brickmaker, the bricklayer, the\r\n      workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith,\r\n      must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were\r\n      we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress\r\n      and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his\r\n      skin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all\r\n      the different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he\r\n      prepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose,\r\n      dug from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long\r\n      sea and a long land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all\r\n      the furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter\r\n      plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different\r\n      hands employed in preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window which\r\n      lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with\r\n      all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy\r\n      invention, without which these northern parts of the world could scarce\r\n      have afforded a very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of\r\n      all the different workmen employed in producing those different\r\n      conveniencies; if we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a\r\n      variety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be sensible\r\n      that, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very\r\n      meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even\r\n      according to, what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in\r\n      which he is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more\r\n      extravagant luxury of the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear\r\n      extremely simple and easy; and yet it may be true, perhaps, that the\r\n      accommodation of an European prince does not always so much exceed that of\r\n      an industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter\r\n      exceeds that of many an African king, the absolute masters of the lives\r\n      and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nOF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION\r\nTO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      This division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not\r\n      originally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that\r\n      general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though\r\n      very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human\r\n      nature, which has in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to\r\n      truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.\r\n\r\n      Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human\r\n      nature, of which no further account can be given, or whether, as seems\r\n      more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason\r\n      and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire. It is common\r\n      to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which seem to\r\n      know neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two greyhounds, in\r\n      running down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance of acting in\r\n      some sort of concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavours\r\n      to intercept her when his companion turns her towards himself. This,\r\n      however, is not the effect of any contract, but of the accidental\r\n      concurrence of their passions in the same object at that particular time.\r\n      Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for\r\n      another with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal, by its gestures and\r\n      natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing\r\n      to give this for that. When an animal wants to obtain something either of\r\n      a man, or of another animal, it has no other means of persuasion, but to\r\n      gain the favour of those whose service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its\r\n      dam, and a spaniel endeavours, by a thousand attractions, to engage the\r\n      attention of its master who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by him.\r\n      Man sometimes uses the same arts with his brethren, and when he has no\r\n      other means of engaging them to act according to his inclinations,\r\n      endeavours by every servile and fawning attention to obtain their good\r\n      will. He has not time, however, to do this upon every occasion. In\r\n      civilized society he stands at all times in need of the co-operation and\r\n      assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce sufficient\r\n      to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every other race of\r\n      animals, each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely\r\n      independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of\r\n      no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the\r\n      help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their\r\n      benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest\r\n      their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own\r\n      advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to\r\n      another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I\r\n      want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such\r\n      offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far\r\n      greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not\r\n      from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we\r\n      expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address\r\n      ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk\r\n      to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a\r\n      beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his\r\n      fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The\r\n      charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with the whole fund\r\n      of his subsistence. But though this principle ultimately provides him with\r\n      all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it neither does nor\r\n      can provide him with them as he has occasion for them. The greater part of\r\n      his occasional wants are supplied in the same manner as those of other\r\n      people, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase. With the money which one\r\n      man gives him he purchases food. The old clothes which another bestows\r\n      upon him he exchanges for other clothes which suit him better, or for\r\n      lodging, or for food, or for money, with which he can buy either food,\r\n      clothes, or lodging, as he has occasion.\r\n\r\n      As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one\r\n      another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in\r\n      need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives\r\n      occasion to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a\r\n      particular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness\r\n      and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or\r\n      for venison, with his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in\r\n      this manner, get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the\r\n      field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the\r\n      making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a\r\n      sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their\r\n      little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way\r\n      to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with\r\n      venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself\r\n      entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In\r\n      the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner\r\n      or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of\r\n      savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus\r\n      part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own\r\n      consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may\r\n      have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular\r\n      occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or\r\n      genius he may possess for that particular species of business.\r\n\r\n      The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much\r\n      less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to\r\n      distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is\r\n      not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division\r\n      of labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between\r\n      a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not\r\n      so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came\r\n      in to the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence,\r\n      they were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor\r\n      play-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or\r\n      soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The\r\n      difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by\r\n      degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to\r\n      acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to truck,\r\n      barter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every\r\n      necessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must have had the\r\n      same duties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been\r\n      no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great\r\n      difference of talents.\r\n\r\n      As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so\r\n      remarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same\r\n      disposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals,\r\n      acknowledged to be all of the same species, derive from nature a much more\r\n      remarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom and\r\n      education, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher is not\r\n      in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a\r\n      mastiff is from a grey-hound, or a grey-hound from a spaniel, or this last\r\n      from a shepherd’s dog. Those different tribes of animals, however, though\r\n      all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength\r\n      of the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of\r\n      the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the spaniel, or by the docility of\r\n      the shepherd’s dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents,\r\n      for want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be\r\n      brought into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the\r\n      better accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still\r\n      obliged to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and\r\n      derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which\r\n      nature has distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary, the most\r\n      dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another; the different produces of\r\n      their respective talents, by the general disposition to truck, barter, and\r\n      exchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where every man\r\n      may purchase whatever part of the produce of other men’s talents he has\r\n      occasion for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS\r\nLIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of\r\n      labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the\r\n      extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.\r\n      When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to\r\n      dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to\r\n      exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is\r\n      over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other\r\n      men’s labour as he has occasion for.\r\n\r\n      There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be\r\n      carried on nowhere but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find\r\n      employment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much too\r\n      narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market-town is scarce large\r\n      enough to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very\r\n      small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the\r\n      highlands of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker, and brewer,\r\n      for his own family. In such situations we can scarce expect to find even a\r\n      smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles of another\r\n      of the same trade. The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles\r\n      distance from the nearest of them, must learn to perform themselves a\r\n      great number of little pieces of work, for which, in more populous\r\n      countries, they would call in the assistance of those workmen. Country\r\n      workmen are almost everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the\r\n      different branches of industry that have so much affinity to one another\r\n      as to be employed about the same sort of materials. A country carpenter\r\n      deals in every sort of work that is made of wood; a country smith in every\r\n      sort of work that is made of iron. The former is not only a carpenter, but\r\n      a joiner, a cabinet-maker, and even a carver in wood, as well as a\r\n      wheel-wright, a plough-wright, a cart and waggon-maker. The employments of\r\n      the latter are still more various. It is impossible there should be such a\r\n      trade as even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the\r\n      highlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails\r\n      a-day, and three hundred working days in the year, will make three hundred\r\n      thousand nails in the year. But in such a situation it would be impossible\r\n      to dispose of one thousand, that is, of one day’s work in the year. As by\r\n      means of water-carriage, a more extensive market is opened to every sort\r\n      of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon the\r\n      sea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every\r\n      kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is\r\n      frequently not till a long time after that those improvements extend\r\n      themselves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled waggon,\r\n      attended by two men, and drawn by eight horses, in about six weeks time,\r\n      carries and brings back between London and Edinburgh near four ton weight\r\n      of goods. In about the same time a ship navigated by six or eight men, and\r\n      sailing between the ports of London and Leith, frequently carries and\r\n      brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six or eight men, therefore,\r\n      by the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring back, in the same time,\r\n      the same quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh as fifty\r\n      broad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred men, and drawn by four\r\n      hundred horses. Upon two hundred tons of goods, therefore, carried by the\r\n      cheapest land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there must be charged the\r\n      maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance and\r\n      what is nearly equal to maintenance the wear and tear of four hundred\r\n      horses, as well as of fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the same quantity\r\n      of goods carried by water, there is to be charged only the maintenance of\r\n      six or eight men, and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundred tons\r\n      burthen, together with the value of the superior risk, or the difference\r\n      of the insurance between land and water-carriage. Were there no other\r\n      communication between those two places, therefore, but by land-carriage,\r\n      as no goods could be transported from the one to the other, except such\r\n      whose price was very considerable in proportion to their weight, they\r\n      could carry on but a small part of that commerce which at present subsists\r\n      between them, and consequently could give but a small part of that\r\n      encouragement which they at present mutually afford to each other’s\r\n      industry. There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the\r\n      distant parts of the world. What goods could bear the expense of\r\n      land-carriage between London and Calcutta? Or if there were any so\r\n      precious as to be able to support this expense, with what safety could\r\n      they be transported through the territories of so many barbarous nations?\r\n      Those two cities, however, at present carry on a very considerable\r\n      commerce with each other, and by mutually affording a market, give a good\r\n      deal of encouragement to each other’s industry.\r\n\r\n      Since such, therefore, are the advantages of water-carriage, it is natural\r\n      that the first improvements of art and industry should be made where this\r\n      conveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every\r\n      sort of labour, and that they should always be much later in extending\r\n      themselves into the inland parts of the country. The inland parts of the\r\n      country can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of\r\n      their goods, but the country which lies round about them, and separates\r\n      them from the sea-coast, and the great navigable rivers. The extent of the\r\n      market, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to the riches and\r\n      populousness of that country, and consequently their improvement must\r\n      always be posterior to the improvement of that country. In our North\r\n      American colonies, the plantations have constantly followed either the\r\n      sea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have scarce anywhere\r\n      extended themselves to any considerable distance from both.\r\n\r\n      The nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear to\r\n      have been first civilized, were those that dwelt round the coast of the\r\n      Mediterranean sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known in\r\n      the world, having no tides, nor consequently any waves, except such as are\r\n      caused by the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well as\r\n      by the multitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring\r\n      shores, extremely favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when,\r\n      from their ignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of\r\n      the coast, and from the imperfection of the art of ship-building, to\r\n      abandon themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond\r\n      the pillars of Hercules, that is, to sail out of the straits of Gibraltar,\r\n      was, in the ancient world, long considered as a most wonderful and\r\n      dangerous exploit of navigation. It was late before even the Phoenicians\r\n      and Carthaginians, the most skilful navigators and ship-builders of those\r\n      old times, attempted it; and they were, for a long time, the only nations\r\n      that did attempt it.\r\n\r\n      Of all the countries on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt seems to\r\n      have been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were\r\n      cultivated and improved to any considerable degree. Upper Egypt extends\r\n      itself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile; and in Lower Egypt, that\r\n      great river breaks itself into many different canals, which, with the\r\n      assistance of a little art, seem to have afforded a communication by\r\n      water-carriage, not only between all the great towns, but between all the\r\n      considerable villages, and even to many farm-houses in the country, nearly\r\n      in the same manner as the Rhine and the Maese do in Holland at present.\r\n      The extent and easiness of this inland navigation was probably one of the\r\n      principal causes of the early improvement of Egypt.\r\n\r\n      The improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have\r\n      been of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East\r\n      Indies, and in some of the eastern provinces of China, though the great\r\n      extent of this antiquity is not authenticated by any histories of whose\r\n      authority we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal, the\r\n      Ganges, and several other great rivers, form a great number of navigable\r\n      canals, in the same manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the eastern\r\n      provinces of China, too, several great rivers form, by their different\r\n      branches, a multitude of canals, and, by communicating with one another,\r\n      afford an inland navigation much more extensive than that either of the\r\n      Nile or the Ganges, or, perhaps, than both of them put together. It is\r\n      remarkable, that neither the ancient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the\r\n      Chinese, encouraged foreign commerce, but seem all to have derived their\r\n      great opulence from this inland navigation.\r\n\r\n      All the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies any\r\n      considerable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient\r\n      Scythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem, in all ages of the world,\r\n      to have been in the same barbarous and uncivilized state in which we find\r\n      them at present. The sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean, which admits of\r\n      no navigation; and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run\r\n      through that country, they are at too great a distance from one another to\r\n      carry commerce and communication through the greater part of it. There are\r\n      in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic seas\r\n      in Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in both Europe and Asia, and\r\n      the gulfs of Arabia, Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to carry\r\n      maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent; and the\r\n      great rivers of Africa are at too great a distance from one another to\r\n      give occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce,\r\n      besides, which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not\r\n      break itself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs\r\n      into another territory before it reaches the sea, can never be very\r\n      considerable, because it is always in the power of the nations who possess\r\n      that other territory to obstruct the communication between the upper\r\n      country and the sea. The navigation of the Danube is of very little use to\r\n      the different states of Bavaria, Austria, and Hungary, in comparison of\r\n      what it would be, if any of them possessed the whole of its course, till\r\n      it falls into the Black sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      When the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is\r\n      but a very small part of a man’s wants which the produce of his own labour\r\n      can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that\r\n      surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his\r\n      own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he\r\n      has occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some\r\n      measure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a\r\n      commercial society.\r\n\r\n      But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of\r\n      exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in\r\n      its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity\r\n      than he himself has occasion for, while another has less. The former,\r\n      consequently, would be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a\r\n      part of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance to have nothing\r\n      that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them.\r\n      The butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the\r\n      brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purchase a part of\r\n      it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the different\r\n      productions of their respective trades, and the butcher is already\r\n      provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate occasion for.\r\n      No exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He cannot be their\r\n      merchant, nor they his customers; and they are all of them thus mutually\r\n      less serviceable to one another. In order to avoid the inconveniency of\r\n      such situations, every prudent man in every period of society, after the\r\n      first establishment of the division of labour, must naturally have\r\n      endeavoured to manage his affairs in such a manner, as to have at all\r\n      times by him, besides the peculiar produce of his own industry, a certain\r\n      quantity of some one commodity or other, such as he imagined few people\r\n      would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of their industry.\r\n      Many different commodities, it is probable, were successively both thought\r\n      of and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages of society, cattle are\r\n      said to have been the common instrument of commerce; and, though they must\r\n      have been a most inconvenient one, yet, in old times, we find things were\r\n      frequently valued according to the number of cattle which had been given\r\n      in exchange for them. The armour of Diomede, says Homer, cost only nine\r\n      oxen; but that of Glaucus cost a hundred oxen. Salt is said to be the\r\n      common instrument of commerce and exchanges in Abyssinia; a species of\r\n      shells in some parts of the coast of India; dried cod at Newfoundland;\r\n      tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our West India colonies; hides or\r\n      dressed leather in some other countries; and there is at this day a\r\n      village in Scotland, where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to\r\n      carry nails instead of money to the baker’s shop or the ale-house.\r\n\r\n      In all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by\r\n      irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to\r\n      metals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as\r\n      little loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable\r\n      than they are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into\r\n      any number of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be re-united\r\n      again; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and\r\n      which, more than any other quality, renders them fit to be the instruments\r\n      of commerce and circulation. The man who wanted to buy salt, for example,\r\n      and had nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it, must have been\r\n      obliged to buy salt to the value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep, at a\r\n      time. He could seldom buy less than this, because what he was to give for\r\n      it could seldom be divided without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more,\r\n      he must, for the same reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple\r\n      the quantity, the value, to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three\r\n      sheep. If, on the contrary, instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to\r\n      give in exchange for it, he could easily proportion the quantity of the\r\n      metal to the precise quantity of the commodity which he had immediate\r\n      occasion for.\r\n\r\n      Different metals have been made use of by different nations for this\r\n      purpose. Iron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient\r\n      Spartans, copper among the ancient Romans, and gold and silver among all\r\n      rich and commercial nations.\r\n\r\n      Those metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in\r\n      rude bars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny (Plin.\r\n      Hist Nat. lib. 33, cap. 3), upon the authority of Timaeus, an ancient\r\n      historian, that, till the time of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no\r\n      coined money, but made use of unstamped bars of copper, to purchase\r\n      whatever they had occasion for. These rude bars, therefore, performed at\r\n      this time the function of money.\r\n\r\n      The use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very\r\n      considerable inconveniences; first, with the trouble of weighing, and\r\n      secondly, with that of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a\r\n      small difference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value,\r\n      even the business of weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least\r\n      very accurate weights and scales. The weighing of gold, in particular, is\r\n      an operation of some nicety in the coarser metals, indeed, where a small\r\n      error would be of little consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be\r\n      necessary. Yet we should find it excessively troublesome if every time a\r\n      poor man had occasion either to buy or sell a farthing’s worth of goods,\r\n      he was obliged to weigh the farthing. The operation of assaying is still\r\n      more difficult, still more tedious; and, unless a part of the metal is\r\n      fairly melted in the crucible, with proper dissolvents, any conclusion\r\n      that can be drawn from it is extremely uncertain. Before the institution\r\n      of coined money, however, unless they went through this tedious and\r\n      difficult operation, people must always have been liable to the grossest\r\n      frauds and impositions; and instead of a pound weight of pure silver, or\r\n      pure copper, might receive, in exchange for their goods, an adulterated\r\n      composition of the coarsest and cheapest materials, which had, however, in\r\n      their outward appearance, been made to resemble those metals. To prevent\r\n      such abuses, to facilitate exchanges, and thereby to encourage all sorts\r\n      of industry and commerce, it has been found necessary, in all countries\r\n      that have made any considerable advances towards improvement, to affix a\r\n      public stamp upon certain quantities of such particular metals, as were in\r\n      those countries commonly made use of to purchase goods. Hence the origin\r\n      of coined money, and of those public offices called mints; institutions\r\n      exactly of the same nature with those of the aulnagers and stamp-masters\r\n      of woollen and linen cloth. All of them are equally meant to ascertain, by\r\n      means of a public stamp, the quantity and uniform goodness of those\r\n      different commodities when brought to market.\r\n\r\n      The first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current\r\n      metals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it was\r\n      both most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or\r\n      fineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is at\r\n      present affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which is\r\n      sometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which, being struck only upon one\r\n      side of the piece, and not covering the whole surface, ascertains the\r\n      fineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the\r\n      four hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of\r\n      Machpelah. They are said, however, to be the current money of the\r\n      merchant, and yet are received by weight, and not by tale, in the same\r\n      manner as ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues\r\n      of the ancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in\r\n      money, but in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts.\r\n      William the Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This\r\n      money, however, was for a long time, received at the exchequer, by weight,\r\n      and not by tale.\r\n\r\n      The inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness,\r\n      gave occasion to the institution of coins, of which the stamp, covering\r\n      entirely both sides of the piece, and sometimes the edges too, was\r\n      supposed to ascertain not only the fineness, but the weight of the metal.\r\n      Such coins, therefore, were received by tale, as at present, without the\r\n      trouble of weighing.\r\n\r\n      The denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the\r\n      weight or quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius\r\n      Tullius, who first coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a\r\n      Roman pound of good copper. It was divided, in the same manner as our\r\n      Troyes pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce of\r\n      good copper. The English pound sterling, in the time of Edward I.\r\n      contained a pound, Tower weight, of silver of a known fineness. The Tower\r\n      pound seems to have been something more than the Roman pound, and\r\n      something less than the Troyes pound. This last was not introduced into\r\n      the mint of England till the 18th of Henry the VIII. The French livre\r\n      contained, in the time of Charlemagne, a pound, Troyes weight, of silver\r\n      of a known fineness. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time\r\n      frequented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and measures of\r\n      so famous a market were generally known and esteemed. The Scots money\r\n      pound contained, from the time of Alexander the First to that of Robert\r\n      Bruce, a pound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the English\r\n      pound sterling. English, French, and Scots pennies, too, contained all of\r\n      them originally a real penny-weight of silver, the twentieth part of an\r\n      ounce, and the two hundred-and-fortieth part of a pound. The shilling,\r\n      too, seems originally to have been the denomination of a weight. “When\r\n      wheat is at twelve shillings the quarter,” says an ancient statute of\r\n      Henry III. “then wastel bread of a farthing shall weigh eleven shillings\r\n      and fourpence”. The proportion, however, between the shilling, and either\r\n      the penny on the one hand, or the pound on the other, seems not to have\r\n      been so constant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound.\r\n      During the first race of the kings of France, the French sou or shilling\r\n      appears upon different occasions to have contained five, twelve, twenty,\r\n      and forty pennies. Among the ancient Saxons, a shilling appears at one\r\n      time to have contained only five pennies, and it is not improbable that it\r\n      may have been as variable among them as among their neighbours, the\r\n      ancient Franks. From the time of Charlemagne among the French, and from\r\n      that of William the Conqueror among the English, the proportion between\r\n      the pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to have been uniformly the\r\n      same as at present, though the value of each has been very different; for\r\n      in every country of the world, I believe, the avarice and injustice of\r\n      princes and sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their subjects,\r\n      have by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been\r\n      originally contained in their coins. The Roman as, in the latter ages of\r\n      the republic, was reduced to the twenty-fourth part of its original value,\r\n      and, instead of weighing a pound, came to weigh only half an ounce. The\r\n      English pound and penny contain at present about a third only; the Scots\r\n      pound and penny about a thirty-sixth; and the French pound and penny about\r\n      a sixty-sixth part of their original value. By means of those operations,\r\n      the princes and sovereign states which performed them were enabled, in\r\n      appearance, to pay their debts and fulfil their engagements with a smaller\r\n      quantity of silver than would otherwise have been requisite. It was indeed\r\n      in appearance only; for their creditors were really defrauded of a part of\r\n      what was due to them. All other debtors in the state were allowed the same\r\n      privilege, and might pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased\r\n      coin whatever they had borrowed in the old. Such operations, therefore,\r\n      have always proved favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor,\r\n      and have sometimes produced a greater and more universal revolution in the\r\n      fortunes of private persons, than could have been occasioned by a very\r\n      great public calamity.\r\n\r\n      It is in this manner that money has become, in all civilized nations, the\r\n      universal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of\r\n      all kinds are bought and sold, or exchanged for one another.\r\n\r\n      What are the rules which men naturally observe, in exchanging them either\r\n      for money, or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These rules\r\n      determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods.\r\n\r\n      The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and\r\n      sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes\r\n      the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object\r\n      conveys. The one may be called ‘value in use;’ the other, ‘value in\r\n      exchange.’ The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently\r\n      little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the\r\n      greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.\r\n      Nothing is more useful than water; but it will purchase scarce any thing;\r\n      scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the\r\n      contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other\r\n      goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.\r\n\r\n      In order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable\r\n      value of commodities, I shall endeavour to shew,\r\n\r\n      First, what is the real measure of this exchangeable value; or wherein\r\n      consists the real price of all commodities.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is\r\n      composed or made up.\r\n\r\n      And, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise\r\n      some or all of these different parts of price above, and sometimes sink\r\n      them below, their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the causes which\r\n      sometimes hinder the market price, that is, the actual price of\r\n      commodities, from coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural\r\n      price.\r\n\r\n      I shall endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly as I can, those\r\n      three subjects in the three following chapters, for which I must very\r\n      earnestly entreat both the patience and attention of the reader: his\r\n      patience, in order to examine a detail which may, perhaps, in some places,\r\n      appear unnecessarily tedious; and his attention, in order to understand\r\n      what may perhaps, after the fullest explication which I am capable of\r\n      giving it, appear still in some degree obscure. I am always willing to run\r\n      some hazard of being tedious, in order to be sure that I am perspicuous;\r\n      and, after taking the utmost pains that I can to be perspicuous, some\r\n      obscurity may still appear to remain upon a subject, in its own nature\r\n      extremely abstracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF\r\nCOMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford\r\n      to enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But\r\n      after the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a\r\n      very small part of these with which a man’s own labour can supply him. The\r\n      far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people,\r\n      and he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which\r\n      he can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any\r\n      commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to\r\n      use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is\r\n      equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or\r\n      command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value\r\n      of all commodities.\r\n\r\n      The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man\r\n      who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What\r\n      every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants\r\n      to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and\r\n      trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other\r\n      people. What is bought with money, or with goods, is purchased by labour,\r\n      as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money, or\r\n      those goods, indeed, save us this toil. They contain the value of a\r\n      certain quantity of labour, which we exchange for what is supposed at the\r\n      time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first\r\n      price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things. It was\r\n      not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world\r\n      was originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who\r\n      want to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the\r\n      quantity of labour which it can enable them to purchase or command.\r\n\r\n      Wealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires,\r\n      or succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire or succeed to\r\n      any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps,\r\n      afford him the means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that\r\n      fortune does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which that\r\n      possession immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of\r\n      purchasing a certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce\r\n      of labour which is then in the market. His fortune is greater or less,\r\n      precisely in proportion to the extent of this power, or to the quantity\r\n      either of other men’s labour, or, what is the same thing, of the produce\r\n      of other men’s labour, which it enables him to purchase or command. The\r\n      exchangeable value of every thing must always be precisely equal to the\r\n      extent of this power which it conveys to its owner.\r\n\r\n      But though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all\r\n      commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated. It\r\n      is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different\r\n      quantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts of work will\r\n      not always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of\r\n      hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken into\r\n      account. There may be more labour in an hour’s hard work, than in two\r\n      hours easy business; or in an hour’s application to a trade which it cost\r\n      ten years labour to learn, than in a month’s industry, at an ordinary and\r\n      obvious employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure either\r\n      of hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the different productions\r\n      of different sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is commonly\r\n      made for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but\r\n      by the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of\r\n      rough equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on the\r\n      business of common life.\r\n\r\n      Every commodity, besides, is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby\r\n      compared with, other commodities, than with labour. It is more natural,\r\n      therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of some\r\n      other commodity, than by that of the labour which it can produce. The\r\n      greater part of people, too, understand better what is meant by a quantity\r\n      of a particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The one is a\r\n      plain palpable object; the other an abstract notion, which though it can\r\n      be made sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so natural and\r\n      obvious.\r\n\r\n      But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of\r\n      commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for\r\n      money than for any other commodity. The butcher seldom carries his beef or\r\n      his mutton to the baker or the brewer, in order to exchange them for bread\r\n      or for beer; but he carries them to the market, where he exchanges them\r\n      for money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread and for beer. The\r\n      quantity of money which he gets for them regulates, too, the quantity of\r\n      bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is more natural and\r\n      obvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value by the quantity of\r\n      money, the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them, than by that\r\n      of bread and beer, the commodities for which he can exchange them only by\r\n      the intervention of another commodity; and rather to say that his\r\n      butcher’s meat is worth three-pence or fourpence a-pound, than that it is\r\n      worth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four quarts of small\r\n      beer. Hence it comes to pass, that the exchangeable value of every\r\n      commodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of money, than by\r\n      the quantity either of labour or of any other commodity which can be had\r\n      in exchange for it.\r\n\r\n      Gold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value;\r\n      are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier and\r\n      sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which any\r\n      particular quantity of them can purchase or command, or the quantity of\r\n      other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertility\r\n      or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time when\r\n      such exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of America,\r\n      reduced, in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in Europe\r\n      to about a third of what it had been before. As it cost less labour to\r\n      bring those metals from the mine to the market, so, when they were brought\r\n      thither, they could purchase or command less labour; and this revolution\r\n      in their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the only one\r\n      of which history gives some account. But as a measure of quantity, such as\r\n      the natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying in its\r\n      own quantity, can never be an accurate measure of the quantity of other\r\n      things; so a commodity which is itself continually varying in its own\r\n      value, can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodities.\r\n      Equal quantities of labour, at all times and places, may be said to be of\r\n      equal value to the labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength,\r\n      and spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must\r\n      always lay down the same portion of his ease, his liberty, and his\r\n      happiness. The price which he pays must always be the same, whatever may\r\n      be the quantity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of these,\r\n      indeed, it may sometimes purchase a greater and sometimes a smaller\r\n      quantity; but it is their value which varies, not that of the labour which\r\n      purchases them. At all times and places, that is dear which it is\r\n      difficult to come at, or which it costs much labour to acquire; and that\r\n      cheap which is to be had easily, or with very little labour. Labour alone,\r\n      therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real\r\n      standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places\r\n      be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal\r\n      price only.\r\n\r\n      But though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the\r\n      labourer, yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes to be of\r\n      greater, and sometimes of smaller value. He purchases them sometimes with\r\n      a greater, and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods, and to him the\r\n      price of labour seems to vary like that of all other things. It appears to\r\n      him dear in the one case, and cheap in the other. In reality, however, it\r\n      is the goods which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other.\r\n\r\n      In this popular sense, therefore, labour, like commodities, may be said to\r\n      have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be said to consist in\r\n      the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are given\r\n      for it; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The labourer is rich\r\n      or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in proportion to the real, not to the\r\n      nominal price of his labour.\r\n\r\n      The distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities and\r\n      labour is not a matter of mere speculation, but may sometimes be of\r\n      considerable use in practice. The same real price is always of the same\r\n      value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver,\r\n      the same nominal price is sometimes of very different values. When a\r\n      landed estate, therefore, is sold with a reservation of a perpetual rent,\r\n      if it is intended that this rent should always be of the same value, it is\r\n      of importance to the family in whose favour it is reserved, that it should\r\n      not consist in a particular sum of money. Its value would in this case be\r\n      liable to variations of two different kinds: first, to those which arise\r\n      from the different quantities of gold and silver which are contained at\r\n      different times in coin of the same denomination; and, secondly, to those\r\n      which arise from the different values of equal quantities of gold and\r\n      silver at different times.\r\n\r\n      Princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a\r\n      temporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in\r\n      their coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it.\r\n      The quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations,\r\n      has accordingly been almost continually diminishing, and hardly ever\r\n      augmenting. Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to diminish the\r\n      value of a money rent.\r\n\r\n      The discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold and\r\n      silver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though I\r\n      apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is\r\n      likely to continue to do so for a long time. Upon this supposition,\r\n      therefore, such variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the\r\n      value of a money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not\r\n      in such a quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many\r\n      pounds sterling, for example), but in so many ounces, either of pure\r\n      silver, or of silver of a certain standard.\r\n\r\n      The rents which have been reserved in corn, have preserved their value\r\n      much better than those which have been reserved in money, even where the\r\n      denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Elizabeth,\r\n      it was enacted, that a third of the rent of all college leases should be\r\n      reserved in corn, to be paid either in kind, or according to the current\r\n      prices at the nearest public market. The money arising from this corn\r\n      rent, though originally but a third of the whole, is, in the present\r\n      times, according to Dr Blackstone, commonly near double of what arises\r\n      from the other two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges must, according\r\n      to this account, have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value,\r\n      or are worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were\r\n      formerly worth. But since the reign of Philip and Mary, the denomination\r\n      of the English coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the same\r\n      number of pounds, shillings, and pence, have contained very nearly the\r\n      same quantity of pure silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of\r\n      the money rents of colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in\r\n      the price of silver.\r\n\r\n      When the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the\r\n      diminution of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the same\r\n      denomination, the loss is frequently still greater. In Scotland, where the\r\n      denomination of the coin has undergone much greater alterations than it\r\n      ever did in England, and in France, where it has undergone still greater\r\n      than it ever did in Scotland, some ancient rents, originally of\r\n      considerable value, have, in this manner, been reduced almost to nothing.\r\n\r\n      Equal quantities of labour will, at distant times, be purchased more\r\n      nearly with equal quantities of corn, the subsistence of the labourer,\r\n      than with equal quantities of gold and silver, or, perhaps, of any other\r\n      commodity. Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at distant times, be\r\n      more nearly of the same real value, or enable the possessor to purchase or\r\n      command more nearly the same quantity of the labour of other people. They\r\n      will do this, I say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other\r\n      commodity; for even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The\r\n      subsistence of the labourer, or the real price of labour, as I shall\r\n      endeavour to shew hereafter, is very different upon different occasions;\r\n      more liberal in a society advancing to opulence, than in one that is\r\n      standing still, and in one that is standing still, than in one that is\r\n      going backwards. Every other commodity, however, will, at any particular\r\n      time, purchase a greater or smaller quantity of labour, in proportion to\r\n      the quantity of subsistence which it can purchase at that time. A rent,\r\n      therefore, reserved in corn, is liable only to the variations in the\r\n      quantity of labour which a certain quantity of corn can purchase. But a\r\n      rent reserved in any other commodity is liable, not only to the variations\r\n      in the quantity of labour which any particular quantity of corn can\r\n      purchase, but to the variations in the quantity of corn which can be\r\n      purchased by any particular quantity of that commodity.\r\n\r\n      Though the real value of a corn rent, it is to be observed, however,\r\n      varies much less from century to century than that of a money rent, it\r\n      varies much more from year to year. The money price of labour, as I shall\r\n      endeavour to shew hereafter, does not fluctuate from year to year with the\r\n      money price of corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the\r\n      temporary or occasional, but to the average or ordinary price of that\r\n      necessary of life. The average or ordinary price of corn, again is\r\n      regulated, as I shall likewise endeavour to shew hereafter, by the value\r\n      of silver, by the richness or barrenness of the mines which supply the\r\n      market with that metal, or by the quantity of labour which must be\r\n      employed, and consequently of corn which must be consumed, in order to\r\n      bring any particular quantity of silver from the mine to the market. But\r\n      the value of silver, though it sometimes varies greatly from century to\r\n      century, seldom varies much from year to year, but frequently continues\r\n      the same, or very nearly the same, for half a century or a century\r\n      together. The ordinary or average money price of corn, therefore, may,\r\n      during so long a period, continue the same, or very nearly the same, too,\r\n      and along with it the money price of labour, provided, at least, the\r\n      society continues, in other respects, in the same, or nearly in the same,\r\n      condition. In the mean time, the temporary and occasional price of corn\r\n      may frequently be double one year of what it had been the year before, or\r\n      fluctuate, for example, from five-and-twenty to fifty shillings the\r\n      quarter. But when corn is at the latter price, not only the nominal, but\r\n      the real value of a corn rent, will be double of what it is when at the\r\n      former, or will command double the quantity either of labour, or of the\r\n      greater part of other commodities; the money price of labour, and along\r\n      with it that of most other things, continuing the same during all these\r\n      fluctuations.\r\n\r\n      Labour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as\r\n      the only accurate, measure of value, or the only standard by which we can\r\n      compare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all\r\n      places. We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different\r\n      commodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which were\r\n      given for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities\r\n      of corn. By the quantities of labour, we can, with the greatest accuracy,\r\n      estimate it, both from century to century, and from year to year. From\r\n      century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from\r\n      century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same\r\n      quantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year\r\n      to year, on the contrary, silver is a better measure than corn, because\r\n      equal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of\r\n      labour.\r\n\r\n      But though, in establishing perpetual rents, or even in letting very long\r\n      leases, it may be of use to distinguish between real and nominal price; it\r\n      is of none in buying and selling, the more common and ordinary\r\n      transactions of human life.\r\n\r\n      At the same time and place, the real and the nominal price of all\r\n      commodities are exactly in proportion to one another. The more or less\r\n      money you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the\r\n      more or less labour it will at that time and place enable you to purchase\r\n      or command. At the same time and place, therefore, money is the exact\r\n      measure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is so,\r\n      however, at the same time and place only.\r\n\r\n      Though at distant places there is no regular proportion between the real\r\n      and the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries goods\r\n      from the one to the other, has nothing to consider but the money price, or\r\n      the difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys them, and\r\n      that for which he is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver at\r\n      Canton in China may command a greater quantity both of labour and of the\r\n      necessaries and conveniencies of life, than an ounce at London. A\r\n      commodity, therefore, which sells for half an ounce of silver at Canton,\r\n      may there be really dearer, of more real importance to the man who\r\n      possesses it there, than a commodity which sells for an ounce at London is\r\n      to the man who possesses it at London. If a London merchant, however, can\r\n      buy at Canton, for half an ounce of silver, a commodity which he can\r\n      afterwards sell at London for an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent. by\r\n      the bargain, just as much as if an ounce of silver was at London exactly\r\n      of the same value as at Canton. It is of no importance to him that half an\r\n      ounce of silver at Canton would have given him the command of more labour,\r\n      and of a greater quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life\r\n      than an ounce can do at London. An ounce at London will always give him\r\n      the command of double the quantity of all these, which half an ounce could\r\n      have done there, and this is precisely what he wants.\r\n\r\n      As it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally\r\n      determines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and\r\n      thereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in which price\r\n      is concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more\r\n      attended to than the real price.\r\n\r\n      In such a work as this, however, it may sometimes be of use to compare the\r\n      different real values of a particular commodity at different times and\r\n      places, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other people\r\n      which it may, upon different occasions, have given to those who possessed\r\n      it. We must in this case compare, not so much the different quantities of\r\n      silver for which it was commonly sold, as the different quantities or\r\n      labour which those different quantities of silver could have purchased.\r\n      But the current prices of labour, at distant times and places, can scarce\r\n      ever be known with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though they\r\n      have in few places been regularly recorded, are in general better known,\r\n      and have been more frequently taken notice of by historians and other\r\n      writers. We must generally, therefore, content ourselves with them, not as\r\n      being always exactly in the same proportion as the current prices of\r\n      labour, but as being the nearest approximation which can commonly be had\r\n      to that proportion. I shall hereafter have occasion to make several\r\n      comparisons of this kind.\r\n\r\n      In the progress of industry, commercial nations have found it convenient\r\n      to coin several different metals into money; gold for larger payments,\r\n      silver for purchases of moderate value, and copper, or some other coarse\r\n      metal, for those of still smaller consideration, They have always,\r\n      however, considered one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure of\r\n      value than any of the other two; and this preference seems generally to\r\n      have been given to the metal which they happen first to make use of as the\r\n      instrument of commerce. Having once begun to use it as their standard,\r\n      which they must have done when they had no other money, they have\r\n      generally continued to do so even when the necessity was not the same.\r\n\r\n      The Romans are said to have had nothing but copper money till within five\r\n      years before the first Punic war (Pliny, lib. xxxiii. cap. 3), when they\r\n      first began to coin silver. Copper, therefore, appears to have continued\r\n      always the measure of value in that republic. At Rome all accounts appear\r\n      to have been kept, and the value of all estates to have been computed,\r\n      either in asses or in sestertii. The as was always the denomination of a\r\n      copper coin. The word sestertius signifies two asses and a half. Though\r\n      the sestertius, therefore, was originally a silver coin, its value was\r\n      estimated in copper. At Rome, one who owed a great deal of money was said\r\n      to have a great deal of other people’s copper.\r\n\r\n      The northern nations who established themselves upon the ruins of the\r\n      Roman empire, seem to have had silver money from the first beginning of\r\n      their settlements, and not to have known either gold or copper coins for\r\n      several ages thereafter. There were silver coins in England in the time of\r\n      the Saxons; but there was little gold coined till the time of Edward III\r\n      nor any copper till that of James I. of Great Britain. In England,\r\n      therefore, and for the same reason, I believe, in all other modern nations\r\n      of Europe, all accounts are kept, and the value of all goods and of all\r\n      estates is generally computed, in silver: and when we mean to express the\r\n      amount of a person’s fortune, we seldom mention the number of guineas, but\r\n      the number of pounds sterling which we suppose would be given for it.\r\n\r\n      Originally, in all countries, I believe, a legal tender of payment could\r\n      be made only in the coin of that metal which was peculiarly considered as\r\n      the standard or measure of value. In England, gold was not considered as a\r\n      legal tender for a long time after it was coined into money. The\r\n      proportion between the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by\r\n      any public law or proclamation, but was left to be settled by the market.\r\n      If a debtor offered payment in gold, the creditor might either reject such\r\n      payment altogether, or accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he\r\n      and his debtor could agree upon. Copper is not at present a legal tender,\r\n      except in the change of the smaller silver coins.\r\n\r\n      In this state of things, the distinction between the metal which was the\r\n      standard, and that which was not the standard, was something more than a\r\n      nominal distinction.\r\n\r\n      In process of time, and as people became gradually more familiar with the\r\n      use of the different metals in coin, and consequently better acquainted\r\n      with the proportion between their respective values, it has, in most\r\n      countries, I believe, been found convenient to ascertain this proportion,\r\n      and to declare by a public law, that a guinea, for example, of such a\r\n      weight and fineness, should exchange for one-and-twenty shillings, or be a\r\n      legal tender for a debt of that amount. In this state of things, and\r\n      during the continuance of any one regulated proportion of this kind, the\r\n      distinction between the metal, which is the standard, and that which is\r\n      not the standard, becomes little more than a nominal distinction.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of any change, however, in this regulated proportion, this\r\n      distinction becomes, or at least seems to become, something more than\r\n      nominal again. If the regulated value of a guinea, for example, was either\r\n      reduced to twenty, or raised to two-and-twenty shillings, all accounts\r\n      being kept, and almost all obligations for debt being expressed, in silver\r\n      money, the greater part of payments could in either case be made with the\r\n      same quantity of silver money as before; but would require very different\r\n      quantities of gold money; a greater in the one case, and a smaller in the\r\n      other. Silver would appear to be more invariable in its value than gold.\r\n      Silver would appear to measure the value of gold, and gold would not\r\n      appear to measure the value of silver. The value of gold would seem to\r\n      depend upon the quantity of silver which it would exchange for, and the\r\n      value of silver would not seem to depend upon the quantity of gold which\r\n      it would exchange for. This difference, however, would be altogether owing\r\n      to the custom of keeping accounts, and of expressing the amount of all\r\n      great and small sums rather in silver than in gold money. One of Mr\r\n      Drummond’s notes for five-and-twenty or fifty guineas would, after an\r\n      alteration of this kind, be still payable with five-and-twenty or fifty\r\n      guineas, in the same manner as before. It would, after such an alteration,\r\n      be payable with the same quantity of gold as before, but with very\r\n      different quantities of silver. In the payment of such a note, gold would\r\n      appear to be more invariable in its value than silver. Gold would appear\r\n      to measure the value of silver, and silver would not appear to measure the\r\n      value of gold. If the custom of keeping accounts, and of expressing\r\n      promissory-notes and other obligations for money, in this manner should\r\n      ever become general, gold, and not silver, would be considered as the\r\n      metal which was peculiarly the standard or measure of value.\r\n\r\n      In reality, during the continuance of any one regulated proportion between\r\n      the respective values of the different metals in coin, the value of the\r\n      most precious metal regulates the value of the whole coin. Twelve copper\r\n      pence contain half a pound avoirdupois of copper, of not the best quality,\r\n      which, before it is coined, is seldom worth seven-pence in silver. But as,\r\n      by the regulation, twelve such pence are ordered to exchange for a\r\n      shilling, they are in the market considered as worth a shilling, and a\r\n      shilling can at any time be had for them. Even before the late reformation\r\n      of the gold coin of Great Britain, the gold, that part of it at least\r\n      which circulated in London and its neighbourhood, was in general less\r\n      degraded below its standard weight than the greater part of the silver.\r\n      One-and-twenty worn and defaced shillings, however, were considered as\r\n      equivalent to a guinea, which, perhaps, indeed, was worn and defaced too,\r\n      but seldom so much so. The late regulations have brought the gold coin as\r\n      near, perhaps, to its standard weight as it is possible to bring the\r\n      current coin of any nation; and the order to receive no gold at the public\r\n      offices but by weight, is likely to preserve it so, as long as that order\r\n      is enforced. The silver coin still continues in the same worn and degraded\r\n      state as before the reformation of the cold coin. In the market, however,\r\n      one-and-twenty shillings of this degraded silver coin are still considered\r\n      as worth a guinea of this excellent gold coin.\r\n\r\n      The reformation of the gold coin has evidently raised the value of the\r\n      silver coin which can be exchanged for it.\r\n\r\n      In the English mint, a pound weight of gold is coined into forty-four\r\n      guineas and a half, which at one-and-twenty shillings the guinea, is equal\r\n      to forty-six pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence. An ounce of such gold\r\n      coin, therefore, is worth £ 3:17:10½ in silver. In England, no duty or\r\n      seignorage is paid upon the coinage, and he who carries a pound weight or\r\n      an ounce weight of standard gold bullion to the mint, gets back a pound\r\n      weight or an ounce weight of gold in coin, without any deduction. Three\r\n      pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny an ounce, therefore, is\r\n      said to be the mint price of gold in England, or the quantity of gold coin\r\n      which the mint gives in return for standard gold bullion.\r\n\r\n      Before the reformation of the gold coin, the price of standard gold\r\n      bullion in the market had, for many years, been upwards of £3:18s.\r\n      sometimes £ 3:19s, and very frequently £4 an ounce; that sum, it is\r\n      probable, in the worn and degraded gold coin, seldom containing more than\r\n      an ounce of standard gold. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the\r\n      market price of standard gold bullion seldom exceeds £ 3:17:7 an ounce.\r\n      Before the reformation of the gold coin, the market price was always more\r\n      or less above the mint price. Since that reformation, the market price has\r\n      been constantly below the mint price. But that market price is the same\r\n      whether it is paid in gold or in silver coin. The late reformation of the\r\n      gold coin, therefore, has raised not only the value of the gold coin, but\r\n      likewise that of the silver coin in proportion to gold bullion, and\r\n      probably, too, in proportion to all other commodities; though the price of\r\n      the greater part of other commodities being influenced by so many other\r\n      causes, the rise in the value of either gold or silver coin in proportion\r\n      to them may not be so distinct and sensible.\r\n\r\n      In the English mint, a pound weight of standard silver bullion is coined\r\n      into sixty-two shillings, containing, in the same manner, a pound weight\r\n      of standard silver. Five shillings and twopence an ounce, therefore, is\r\n      said to be the mint price of silver in England, or the quantity of silver\r\n      coin which the mint gives in return for standard silver bullion. Before\r\n      the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard silver\r\n      bullion was, upon different occasions, five shillings and fourpence, five\r\n      shillings and fivepence, five shillings and sixpence, five shillings and\r\n      sevenpence, and very often five shillings and eightpence an ounce. Five\r\n      shillings and sevenpence, however, seems to have been the most common\r\n      price. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of\r\n      standard silver bullion has fallen occasionally to five shillings and\r\n      threepence, five shillings and fourpence, and five shillings and fivepence\r\n      an ounce, which last price it has scarce ever exceeded. Though the market\r\n      price of silver bullion has fallen considerably since the reformation of\r\n      the gold coin, it has not fallen so low as the mint price.\r\n\r\n      In the proportion between the different metals in the English coin, as\r\n      copper is rated very much above its real value, so silver is rated\r\n      somewhat below it. In the market of Europe, in the French coin and in the\r\n      Dutch coin, an ounce of fine gold exchanges for about fourteen ounces of\r\n      fine silver. In the English coin, it exchanges for about fifteen ounces,\r\n      that is, for more silver than it is worth, according to the common\r\n      estimation of Europe. But as the price of copper in bars is not, even in\r\n      England, raised by the high price of copper in English coin, so the price\r\n      of silver in bullion is not sunk by the low rate of silver in English\r\n      coin. Silver in bullion still preserves its proper proportion to gold, for\r\n      the same reason that copper in bars preserves its proper proportion to\r\n      silver.\r\n\r\n      Upon the reformation of the silver coin, in the reign of William III., the\r\n      price of silver bullion still continued to be somewhat above the mint\r\n      price. Mr Locke imputed this high price to the permission of exporting\r\n      silver bullion, and to the prohibition of exporting silver coin. This\r\n      permission of exporting, he said, rendered the demand for silver bullion\r\n      greater than the demand for silver coin. But the number of people who want\r\n      silver coin for the common uses of buying and selling at home, is surely\r\n      much greater than that of those who want silver bullion either for the use\r\n      of exportation or for any other use. There subsists at present a like\r\n      permission of exporting gold bullion, and a like prohibition of exporting\r\n      gold coin; and yet the price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint\r\n      price. But in the English coin, silver was then, in the same manner as\r\n      now, under-rated in proportion to gold; and the gold coin (which at that\r\n      time, too, was not supposed to require any reformation) regulated then, as\r\n      well as now, the real value of the whole coin. As the reformation of the\r\n      silver coin did not then reduce the price of silver bullion to the mint\r\n      price, it is not very probable that a like reformation will do so now.\r\n\r\n      Were the silver coin brought back as near to its standard weight as the\r\n      gold, a guinea, it is probable, would, according to the present\r\n      proportion, exchange for more silver in coin than it would purchase in\r\n      bullion. The silver coin containing its full standard weight, there would\r\n      in this case, be a profit in melting it down, in order, first to sell the\r\n      bullion for gold coin, and afterwards to exchange this gold coin for\r\n      silver coin, to be melted down in the same manner. Some alteration in the\r\n      present proportion seems to be the only method of preventing this\r\n      inconveniency.\r\n\r\n      The inconveniency, perhaps, would be less, if silver was rated in the coin\r\n      as much above its proper proportion to gold as it is at present rated\r\n      below it, provided it was at the same time enacted, that silver should not\r\n      be a legal tender for more than the change of a guinea, in the same manner\r\n      as copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a shilling. No\r\n      creditor could, in this case, be cheated in consequence of the high\r\n      valuation of silver in coin; as no creditor can at present be cheated in\r\n      consequence of the high valuation of copper. The bankers only would suffer\r\n      by this regulation. When a run comes upon them, they sometimes endeavour\r\n      to gain time, by paying in sixpences, and they would be precluded by this\r\n      regulation from this discreditable method of evading immediate payment.\r\n      They would be obliged, in consequence, to keep at all times in their\r\n      coffers a greater quantity of cash than at present; and though this might,\r\n      no doubt, be a considerable inconveniency to them, it would, at the same\r\n      time, be a considerable security to their creditors.\r\n\r\n      Three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny (the mint price of\r\n      gold) certainly does not contain, even in our present excellent gold coin,\r\n      more than an ounce of standard gold, and it may be thought, therefore,\r\n      should not purchase more standard bullion. But gold in coin is more\r\n      convenient than gold in bullion; and though, in England, the coinage is\r\n      free, yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint, can seldom be\r\n      returned in coin to the owner till after a delay of several weeks. In the\r\n      present hurry of the mint, it could not be returned till after a delay of\r\n      several months. This delay is equivalent to a small duty, and renders gold\r\n      in coin somewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bullion.\r\n      If, in the English coin, silver was rated according to its proper\r\n      proportion to gold, the price of silver bullion would probably fall below\r\n      the mint price, even without any reformation of the silver coin; the value\r\n      even of the present worn and defaced silver coin being regulated by the\r\n      value of the excellent gold coin for which it can be changed.\r\n\r\n      A small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver, would\r\n      probably increase still more the superiority of those metals in coin above\r\n      an equal quantity of either of them in bullion. The coinage would, in this\r\n      case, increase the value of the metal coined in proportion to the extent\r\n      of this small duty, for the same reason that the fashion increases the\r\n      value of plate in proportion to the price of that fashion. The superiority\r\n      of coin above bullion would prevent the melting down of the coin, and\r\n      would discourage its exportation. If, upon any public exigency, it should\r\n      become necessary to export the coin, the greater part of it would soon\r\n      return again, of its own accord. Abroad, it could sell only for its weight\r\n      in bullion. At home, it would buy more than that weight. There would be a\r\n      profit, therefore, in bringing it home again. In France, a seignorage of\r\n      about eight per cent. is imposed upon the coinage, and the French coin,\r\n      when exported, is said to return home again, of its own accord.\r\n\r\n      The occasional fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver bullion\r\n      arise from the same causes as the like fluctuations in that of all other\r\n      commodities. The frequent loss of those metals from various accidents by\r\n      sea and by land, the continual waste of them in gilding and plating, in\r\n      lace and embroidery, in the wear and tear of coin, and in that of plate,\r\n      require, in all countries which possess no mines of their own, a continual\r\n      importation, in order to repair this loss and this waste. The merchant\r\n      importers, like all other merchants, we may believe, endeavour, as well as\r\n      they can, to suit their occasional importations to what they judge is\r\n      likely to be the immediate demand. With all their attention, however, they\r\n      sometimes overdo the business, and sometimes underdo it. When they import\r\n      more bullion than is wanted, rather than incur the risk and trouble of\r\n      exporting it again, they are sometimes willing to sell a part of it for\r\n      something less than the ordinary or average price. When, on the other\r\n      hand, they import less than is wanted, they get something more than this\r\n      price. But when, under all those occasional fluctuations, the market price\r\n      either of gold or silver bullion continues for several years together\r\n      steadily and constantly, either more or less above, or more or less below\r\n      the mint price, we may be assured that this steady and constant, either\r\n      superiority or inferiority of price, is the effect of something in the\r\n      state of the coin, which, at that time, renders a certain quantity of coin\r\n      either of more value or of less value than the precise quantity of bullion\r\n      which it ought to contain. The constancy and steadiness of the effect\r\n      supposes a proportionable constancy and steadiness in the cause.\r\n\r\n      The money of any particular country is, at any particular time and place,\r\n      more or less an accurate measure or value, according as the current coin\r\n      is more or less exactly agreeable to its standard, or contains more or\r\n      less exactly the precise quantity of pure gold or pure silver which it\r\n      ought to contain. If in England, for example, forty-four guineas and a\r\n      half contained exactly a pound weight of standard gold, or eleven ounces\r\n      of fine gold, and one ounce of alloy, the gold coin of England would be as\r\n      accurate a measure of the actual value of goods at any particular time and\r\n      place as the nature of the thing would admit. But if, by rubbing and\r\n      wearing, forty-four guineas and a half generally contain less than a pound\r\n      weight of standard gold, the diminution, however, being greater in some\r\n      pieces than in others, the measure of value comes to be liable to the same\r\n      sort of uncertainty to which all other weights and measures are commonly\r\n      exposed. As it rarely happens that these are exactly agreeable to their\r\n      standard, the merchant adjusts the price of his goods as well as he can,\r\n      not to what those weights and measures ought to be, but to what, upon an\r\n      average, he finds, by experience, they actually are. In consequence of a\r\n      like disorder in the coin, the price of goods comes, in the same manner,\r\n      to be adjusted, not to the quantity of pure gold or silver which the coin\r\n      ought to contain, but to that which, upon an average, it is found, by\r\n      experience, it actually does contain.\r\n\r\n      By the money price of goods, it is to be observed, I understand always the\r\n      quantity of pure gold or silver for which they are sold, without any\r\n      regard to the denomination of the coin. Six shillings and eight pence, for\r\n      example, in the time of Edward I., I consider as the same money price with\r\n      a pound sterling in the present times, because it contained, as nearly as\r\n      we can judge, the same quantity of pure silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nOF THE COMPONENT PART OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In that early and rude state of society which precedes both the\r\n      accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion\r\n      between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different\r\n      objects, seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for\r\n      exchanging them for one another. If among a nation of hunters, for\r\n      example, it usually costs twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does\r\n      to kill a deer, one beaver should naturally exchange for or be worth two\r\n      deer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days or two\r\n      hours labour, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one\r\n      day’s or one hour’s labour.\r\n\r\n      If the one species of labour should be more severe than the other, some\r\n      allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship; and the\r\n      produce of one hour’s labour in the one way may frequently exchange for\r\n      that of two hour’s labour in the other.\r\n\r\n      Or if the one species of labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity\r\n      and ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents, will naturally\r\n      give a value to their produce, superior to what would be due to the time\r\n      employed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired but in consequence\r\n      of long application, and the superior value of their produce may\r\n      frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and\r\n      labour which must be spent in acquiring them. In the advanced state of\r\n      society, allowances of this kind, for superior hardship and superior\r\n      skill, are commonly made in the wages of labour; and something of the same\r\n      kind must probably have taken place in its earliest and rudest period.\r\n\r\n      In this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the\r\n      labourer; and the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or\r\n      producing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can regulate the\r\n      quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or\r\n      exchange for.\r\n\r\n      As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some\r\n      of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people,\r\n      whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a\r\n      profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the\r\n      value of the materials. In exchanging the complete manufacture either for\r\n      money, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be\r\n      sufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the\r\n      workmen, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of the\r\n      work, who hazards his stock in this adventure. The value which the workmen\r\n      add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two\r\n      parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their\r\n      employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced. He\r\n      could have no interest to employ them, unless he expected from the sale of\r\n      their work something more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to\r\n      him; and he could have no interest to employ a great stock rather than a\r\n      small one, unless his profits were to bear some proportion to the extent\r\n      of his stock.\r\n\r\n      The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name\r\n      for the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspection and\r\n      direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by quite\r\n      different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the\r\n      hardship, or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and\r\n      direction. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock\r\n      employed, and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this\r\n      stock. Let us suppose, for example, that in some particular place, where\r\n      the common annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent. there\r\n      are two different manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are\r\n      employed, at the rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the expense of\r\n      three hundred a-year in each manufactory. Let us suppose, too, that the\r\n      coarse materials annually wrought up in the one cost only seven hundred\r\n      pounds, while the finer materials in the other cost seven thousand. The\r\n      capital annually employed in the one will, in this case, amount only to\r\n      one thousand pounds; whereas that employed in the other will amount to\r\n      seven thousand three hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent.\r\n      therefore, the undertaker of the one will expect a yearly profit of about\r\n      one hundred pounds only; while that of the other will expect about seven\r\n      hundred and thirty pounds. But though their profits are so very different,\r\n      their labour of inspection and direction may be either altogether or very\r\n      nearly the same. In many great works, almost the whole labour of this kind\r\n      is committed to some principal clerk. His wages properly express the value\r\n      of this labour of inspection and direction. Though in settling them some\r\n      regard is had commonly, not only to his labour and skill, but to the trust\r\n      which is reposed in him, yet they never bear any regular proportion to the\r\n      capital of which he oversees the management; and the owner of this\r\n      capital, though he is thus discharged of almost all labour, still expects\r\n      that his profit should bear a regular proportion to his capital. In the\r\n      price of commodities, therefore, the profits of stock constitute a\r\n      component part altogether different from the wages of labour, and\r\n      regulated by quite different principles.\r\n\r\n      In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always\r\n      belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of\r\n      the stock which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour commonly\r\n      employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance\r\n      which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase,\r\n      command or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be\r\n      due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished\r\n      the materials of that labour.\r\n\r\n      As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the\r\n      landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and\r\n      demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the\r\n      grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when\r\n      land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them,\r\n      come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must\r\n      then pay for the licence to gather them, and must give up to the landlord\r\n      a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion,\r\n      or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes\r\n      the rent of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities,\r\n      makes a third component part.\r\n\r\n      The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be\r\n      observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of\r\n      them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value, not only of that\r\n      part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which\r\n      resolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.\r\n\r\n      In every society, the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\r\n      into some one or other, or all of those three parts; and in every improved\r\n      society, all the three enter, more or less, as component parts, into the\r\n      price of the far greater part of commodities.\r\n\r\n      In the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord,\r\n      another pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring\r\n      cattle employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of the\r\n      farmer. These three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up\r\n      the whole price of corn. A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought is\r\n      necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the\r\n      wear and tear of his labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry.\r\n      But it must be considered, that the price of any instrument of husbandry,\r\n      such as a labouring horse, is itself made up of the same time parts; the\r\n      rent of the land upon which he is reared, the labour of tending and\r\n      rearing him, and the profits of the farmer, who advances both the rent of\r\n      this land, and the wages of this labour. Though the price of the corn,\r\n      therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the\r\n      whole price still resolves itself, either immediately or ultimately, into\r\n      the same three parts of rent, labour, and profit.\r\n\r\n      In the price of flour or meal, we must add to the price of the corn, the\r\n      profits of the miller, and the wages of his servants; in the price of\r\n      bread, the profits of the baker, and the wages of his servants; and in the\r\n      price of both, the labour of transporting the corn from the house of the\r\n      farmer to that of the miller, and from that of the miller to that of the\r\n      baker, together with the profits of those who advance the wages of that\r\n      labour.\r\n\r\n      The price of flax resolves itself into the same three parts as that of\r\n      corn. In the price of linen we must add to this price the wages of the\r\n      flax-dresser, of the spinner, of the weaver, of the bleacher, etc.\r\n      together with the profits of their respective employers.\r\n\r\n      As any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured, that part of\r\n      the price which resolves itself into wages and profit, comes to be greater\r\n      in proportion to that which resolves itself into rent. In the progress of\r\n      the manufacture, not only the number of profits increase, but every\r\n      subsequent profit is greater than the foregoing; because the capital from\r\n      which it is derived must always be greater. The capital which employs the\r\n      weavers, for example, must be greater than that which employs the\r\n      spinners; because it not only replaces that capital with its profits, but\r\n      pays, besides, the wages of the weavers: and the profits must always bear\r\n      some proportion to the capital.\r\n\r\n      In the most improved societies, however, there are always a few\r\n      commodities of which the price resolves itself into two parts only: the\r\n      wages of labour, and the profits of stock; and a still smaller number, in\r\n      which it consists altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of\r\n      sea-fish, for example, one part pays the labour of the fisherman, and the\r\n      other the profits of the capital employed in the fishery. Rent very seldom\r\n      makes any part of it, though it does sometimes, as I shall shew hereafter.\r\n      It is otherwise, at least through the greater part of Europe, in river\r\n      fisheries. A salmon fishery pays a rent; and rent, though it cannot well\r\n      be called the rent of land, makes a part of the price of a salmon, as well\r\n      as wares and profit. In some parts of Scotland, a few poor people make a\r\n      trade of gathering, along the sea-shore, those little variegated stones\r\n      commonly known by the name of Scotch pebbles. The price which is paid to\r\n      them by the stone-cutter, is altogether the wages of their labour; neither\r\n      rent nor profit makes any part of it.\r\n\r\n      But the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself\r\n      into some one or other or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it\r\n      remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole\r\n      labour employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market, must\r\n      necessarily be profit to somebody.\r\n\r\n      As the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity, taken\r\n      separately, resolves itself into some one or other, or all of those three\r\n      parts; so that of all the commodities which compose the whole annual\r\n      produce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, must resolve\r\n      itself into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among different\r\n      inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the\r\n      profits of their stock, or the rent of their land. The whole of what is\r\n      annually either collected or produced by the labour of every society, or,\r\n      what comes to the same thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner\r\n      originally distributed among some of its different members. Wages, profit,\r\n      and rent, are the three original sources of all revenue, as well as of all\r\n      exchangeable value. All other revenue is ultimately derived from some one\r\n      or other of these.\r\n\r\n      Whoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it\r\n      either from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue\r\n      derived from labour is called wages; that derived from stock, by the\r\n      person who manages or employs it, is called profit; that derived from it\r\n      by the person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is\r\n      called the interest or the use of money. It is the compensation which the\r\n      borrower pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an opportunity of\r\n      making by the use of the money. Part of that profit naturally belongs to\r\n      the borrower, who runs the risk and takes the trouble of employing it, and\r\n      part to the lender, who affords him the opportunity of making this profit.\r\n      The interest of money is always a derivative revenue, which, if it is not\r\n      paid from the profit which is made by the use of the money, must be paid\r\n      from some other source of revenue, unless perhaps the borrower is a\r\n      spendthrift, who contracts a second debt in order to pay the interest of\r\n      the first. The revenue which proceeds altogether from land, is called\r\n      rent, and belongs to the landlord. The revenue of the farmer is derived\r\n      partly from his labour, and partly from his stock. To him, land is only\r\n      the instrument which enables him to earn the wages of this labour, and to\r\n      make the profits of this stock. All taxes, and all the revenue which is\r\n      founded upon them, all salaries, pensions, and annuities of every kind,\r\n      are ultimately derived from some one or other of those three original\r\n      sources of revenue, and are paid either immediately or mediately from the\r\n      wages of labour, the profits of stock, or the rent of land.\r\n\r\n      When those three different sorts of revenue belong to different persons,\r\n      they are readily distinguished; but when they belong to the same, they are\r\n      sometimes confounded with one another, at least in common language.\r\n\r\n      A gentleman who farms a part of his own estate, after paying the expense\r\n      of cultivation, should gain both the rent of the landlord and the profit\r\n      of the farmer. He is apt to denominate, however, his whole gain, profit,\r\n      and thus confounds rent with profit, at least in common language. The\r\n      greater part of our North American and West Indian planters are in this\r\n      situation. They farm, the greater part of them, their own estates: and\r\n      accordingly we seldom hear of the rent of a plantation, but frequently of\r\n      its profit.\r\n\r\n      Common farmers seldom employ any overseer to direct the general operations\r\n      of the farm. They generally, too, work a good deal with their own hands,\r\n      as ploughmen, harrowers, etc. What remains of the crop, after paying the\r\n      rent, therefore, should not only replace to them their stock employed in\r\n      cultivation, together with its ordinary profits, but pay them the wages\r\n      which are due to them, both as labourers and overseers. Whatever remains,\r\n      however, after paying the rent and keeping up the stock, is called profit.\r\n      But wages evidently make a part of it. The farmer, by saving these wages,\r\n      must necessarily gain them. Wages, therefore, are in this case confounded\r\n      with profit.\r\n\r\n      An independent manufacturer, who has stock enough both to purchase\r\n      materials, and to maintain himself till he can carry his work to market,\r\n      should gain both the wages of a journeyman who works under a master, and\r\n      the profit which that master makes by the sale of that journeyman’s work.\r\n      His whole gains, however, are commonly called profit, and wages are, in\r\n      this case, too, confounded with profit.\r\n\r\n      A gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands, unites in his\r\n      own person the three different characters, of landlord, farmer, and\r\n      labourer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first,\r\n      the profit of the second, and the wages of the third. The whole, however,\r\n      is commonly considered as the earnings of his labour. Both rent and profit\r\n      are, in this case, confounded with wages.\r\n\r\n      As in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the\r\n      exchangeable value arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing\r\n      largely to that of the far greater part of them, so the annual produce of\r\n      its labour will always be sufficient to purchase or command a much greater\r\n      quantity of labour than what was employed in raising, preparing, and\r\n      bringing that produce to market. If the society were annually to employ\r\n      all the labour which it can annually purchase, as the quantity of labour\r\n      would increase greatly every year, so the produce of every succeeding year\r\n      would be of vastly greater value than that of the foregoing. But there is\r\n      no country in which the whole annual produce is employed in maintaining\r\n      the industrious. The idle everywhere consume a great part of it; and,\r\n      according to the different proportions in which it is annually divided\r\n      between those two different orders of people, its ordinary or average\r\n      value must either annually increase or diminish, or continue the same from\r\n      one year to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nOF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE OF COMMODITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      There is in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate,\r\n      both of wages and profit, in every different employment of labour and\r\n      stock. This rate is naturally regulated, as I shall shew hereafter, partly\r\n      by the general circumstances of the society, their riches or poverty,\r\n      their advancing, stationary, or declining condition, and partly by the\r\n      particular nature of each employment.\r\n\r\n      There is likewise in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average\r\n      rate of rent, which is regulated, too, as I shall shew hereafter, partly\r\n      by the general circumstances of the society or neighbourhood in which the\r\n      land is situated, and partly by the natural or improved fertility of the\r\n      land.\r\n\r\n      These ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of wages,\r\n      profit and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail.\r\n\r\n      When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is\r\n      sufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the labour, and the\r\n      profits of the stock employed in raising, preparing, and bringing it to\r\n      market, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then sold for\r\n      what may be called its natural price.\r\n\r\n      The commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth, or for what it\r\n      really costs the person who brings it to market; for though, in common\r\n      language, what is called the prime cost of any commodity does not\r\n      comprehend the profit of the person who is to sell it again, yet, if he\r\n      sells it at a price which does not allow him the ordinary rate of profit\r\n      in his neighbourhood, he is evidently a loser by the trade; since, by\r\n      employing his stock in some other way, he might have made that profit. His\r\n      profit, besides, is his revenue, the proper fund of his subsistence. As,\r\n      while he is preparing and bringing the goods to market, he advances to his\r\n      workmen their wages, or their subsistence; so he advances to himself, in\r\n      the same manner, his own subsistence, which is generally suitable to the\r\n      profit which he may reasonably expect from the sale of his goods. Unless\r\n      they yield him this profit, therefore, they do not repay him what they may\r\n      very properly be said to have really cost him.\r\n\r\n      Though the price, therefore, which leaves him this profit, is not always\r\n      the lowest at which a dealer may sometimes sell his goods, it is the\r\n      lowest at which he is likely to sell them for any considerable time; at\r\n      least where there is perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as\r\n      often as he pleases.\r\n\r\n      The actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold, is called its\r\n      market price. It may either be above, or below, or exactly the same with\r\n      its natural price.\r\n\r\n      The market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the\r\n      proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market, and\r\n      the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the\r\n      commodity, or the whole value of the rent, labour, and profit, which must\r\n      be paid in order to bring it thither. Such people may be called the\r\n      effectual demanders, and their demand the effectual demand; since it maybe\r\n      sufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market. It is\r\n      different from the absolute demand. A very poor man may be said, in some\r\n      sense, to have a demand for a coach and six; he might like to have it; but\r\n      his demand is not an effectual demand, as the commodity can never be\r\n      brought to market in order to satisfy it.\r\n\r\n      When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short\r\n      of the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the whole value\r\n      of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it\r\n      thither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather than\r\n      want it altogether, some of them will be willing to give more. A\r\n      competition will immediately begin among them, and the market price will\r\n      rise more or less above the natural price, according as either the\r\n      greatness of the deficiency, or the wealth and wanton luxury of the\r\n      competitors, happen to animate more or less the eagerness of the\r\n      competition. Among competitors of equal wealth and luxury, the same\r\n      deficiency will generally occasion a more or less eager competition,\r\n      according as the acquisition of the commodity happens to be of more or\r\n      less importance to them. Hence the exorbitant price of the necessaries of\r\n      life during the blockade of a town, or in a famine.\r\n\r\n      When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it\r\n      cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the\r\n      rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither.\r\n      Some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low\r\n      price which they give for it must reduce the price of the whole. The\r\n      market price will sink more or less below the natural price, according as\r\n      the greatness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the\r\n      sellers, or according as it happens to be more or less important to them\r\n      to get immediately rid of the commodity. The same excess in the\r\n      importation of perishable, will occasion a much greater competition than\r\n      in that of durable commodities; in the importation of oranges, for\r\n      example, than in that of old iron.\r\n\r\n      When the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the\r\n      effectual demand, and no more, the market price naturally comes to be\r\n      either exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the\r\n      natural price. The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this\r\n      price, and can not be disposed of for more. The competition of the\r\n      different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not\r\n      oblige them to accept of less.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself\r\n      to the effectual demand. It is the interest of all those who employ their\r\n      land, labour, or stock, in bringing any commodity to market, that the\r\n      quantity never should exceed the effectual demand; and it is the interest\r\n      of all other people that it never should fall short of that demand.\r\n\r\n      If at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of the component\r\n      parts of its price must be paid below their natural rate. If it is rent,\r\n      the interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a\r\n      part of their land; and if it is wages or profit, the interest of the\r\n      labourers in the one case, and of their employers in the other, will\r\n      prompt them to withdraw a part of their labour or stock, from this\r\n      employment. The quantity brought to market will soon be no more than\r\n      sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its\r\n      price will rise to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural\r\n      price.\r\n\r\n      If, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time\r\n      fall short of the effectual demand, some of the component parts of its\r\n      price must rise above their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of\r\n      all other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for\r\n      the raising of this commodity; if it is wages or profit, the interest of\r\n      all other labourers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more\r\n      labour and stock in preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity\r\n      brought thither will soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand.\r\n      All the different parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate,\r\n      and the whole price to its natural price.\r\n\r\n      The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which\r\n      the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different\r\n      accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and\r\n      sometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be the\r\n      obstacles which hinder them from settling in this centre of repose and\r\n      continuance, they are constantly tending towards it.\r\n\r\n      The whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any\r\n      commodity to market, naturally suits itself in this manner to the\r\n      effectual demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that precise\r\n      quantity thither which may be sufficient to supply, and no more than\r\n      supply, that demand.\r\n\r\n      But, in some employments, the same quantity of industry will, in different\r\n      years, produce very different quantities of commodities; while, in others,\r\n      it will produce always the same, or very nearly the same. The same number\r\n      of labourers in husbandry will, in different years, produce very different\r\n      quantities of corn, wine, oil, hops, etc. But the same number of spinners\r\n      or weavers will every year produce the same, or very nearly the same,\r\n      quantity of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce of the\r\n      one species of industry which can be suited, in any respect, to the\r\n      effectual demand; and as its actual produce is frequently much greater,\r\n      and frequently much less, than its average produce, the quantity of the\r\n      commodities brought to market will sometimes exceed a good deal, and\r\n      sometimes fall short a good deal, of the effectual demand. Even though\r\n      that demand, therefore, should continue always the same, their market\r\n      price will be liable to great fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good\r\n      deal below, and sometimes rise a good deal above, their natural price. In\r\n      the other species of industry, the produce of equal quantities of labour\r\n      being always the same, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly\r\n      suited to the effectual demand. While that demand continues the same,\r\n      therefore, the market price of the commodities is likely to do so too, and\r\n      to be either altogether, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with\r\n      the natural price. That the price of linen and woollen cloth is liable\r\n      neither to such frequent, nor to such great variations, as the price of\r\n      corn, every man’s experience will inform him. The price of the one species\r\n      of commodities varies only with the variations in the demand; that of the\r\n      other varies not only with the variations in the demand, but with the much\r\n      greater, and more frequent, variations in the quantity of what is brought\r\n      to market, in order to supply that demand.\r\n\r\n      The occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any\r\n      commodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve\r\n      themselves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into\r\n      rent is less affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the least\r\n      affected by them, either in its rate or in its value. A rent which\r\n      consists either in a certain proportion, or in a certain quantity, of the\r\n      rude produce, is no doubt affected in its yearly value by all the\r\n      occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of that rude\r\n      produce; but it is seldom affected by them in its yearly rate. In settling\r\n      the terms of the lease, the landlord and farmer endeavour, according to\r\n      their best judgment, to adjust that rate, not to the temporary and\r\n      occasional, but to the average and ordinary price of the produce.\r\n\r\n      Such fluctuations affect both the value and the rate, either of wages or\r\n      of profit, according as the market happens to be either overstocked or\r\n      understocked with commodities or with labour, with work done, or with work\r\n      to be done. A public mourning raises the price of black cloth (with which\r\n      the market is almost always understocked upon such occasions), and\r\n      augments the profits of the merchants who possess any considerable\r\n      quantity of it. It has no effect upon the wages of the weavers. The market\r\n      is understocked with commodities, not with labour, with work done, not\r\n      with work to be done. It raises the wages of journeymen tailors. The\r\n      market is here understocked with labour. There is an effectual demand for\r\n      more labour, for more work to be done, than can be had. It sinks the price\r\n      of coloured silks and cloths, and thereby reduces the profits of the\r\n      merchants who have any considerable quantity of them upon hand. It sinks,\r\n      too, the wages of the workmen employed in preparing such commodities, for\r\n      which all demand is stopped for six months, perhaps for a twelvemonth. The\r\n      market is here overstocked both with commodities and with labour.\r\n\r\n      But though the market price of every particular commodity is in this\r\n      manner continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards the natural\r\n      price; yet sometimes particular accidents, sometimes natural causes, and\r\n      sometimes particular regulations of policy, may, in many commodities, keep\r\n      up the market price, for a long time together, a good deal above the\r\n      natural price.\r\n\r\n      When, by an increase in the effectual demand, the market price of some\r\n      particular commodity happens to rise a good deal above the natural price,\r\n      those who employ their stocks in supplying that market, are generally\r\n      careful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known, their great\r\n      profit would tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks in the same\r\n      way, that, the effectual demand being fully supplied, the market price\r\n      would soon be reduced to the natural price, and, perhaps, for some time\r\n      even below it. If the market is at a great distance from the residence of\r\n      those who supply it, they may sometimes be able to keep the secret for\r\n      several years together, and may so long enjoy their extraordinary profits\r\n      without any new rivals. Secrets of this kind, however, it must be\r\n      acknowledged, can seldom be long kept; and the extraordinary profit can\r\n      last very little longer than they are kept.\r\n\r\n      Secrets in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets in\r\n      trade. A dyer who has found the means of producing a particular colour\r\n      with materials which cost only half the price of those commonly made use\r\n      of, may, with good management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery as\r\n      long as he lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity. His\r\n      extraordinary gains arise from the high price which is paid for his\r\n      private labour. They properly consist in the high wages of that labour.\r\n      But as they are repeated upon every part of his stock, and as their whole\r\n      amount bears, upon that account, a regular proportion to it, they are\r\n      commonly considered as extraordinary profits of stock.\r\n\r\n      Such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effects of\r\n      particular accidents, of which, however, the operation may sometimes last\r\n      for many years together.\r\n\r\n      Some natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situation,\r\n      that all the land in a great country, which is fit for producing them, may\r\n      not be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. The whole quantity\r\n      brought to market, therefore, may be disposed of to those who are willing\r\n      to give more than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land which\r\n      produced them, together with the wages of the labour and the profits of\r\n      the stock which were employed in preparing and bringing them to market,\r\n      according to their natural rates. Such commodities may continue for whole\r\n      centuries together to be sold at this high price; and that part of it\r\n      which resolves itself into the rent of land, is in this case the part\r\n      which is generally paid above its natural rate. The rent of the land which\r\n      affords such singular and esteemed productions, like the rent of some\r\n      vineyards in France of a peculiarly happy soil and situation, bears no\r\n      regular proportion to the rent of other equally fertile and equally well\r\n      cultivated land in its neighbourhood. The wages of the labour, and the\r\n      profits of the stock employed in bringing such commodities to market, on\r\n      the contrary, are seldom out of their natural proportion to those of the\r\n      other employments of labour and stock in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n      Such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of natural\r\n      causes, which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being fully\r\n      supplied, and which may continue, therefore, to operate for ever.\r\n\r\n      A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company, has\r\n      the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by\r\n      keeping the market constantly understocked by never fully supplying the\r\n      effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and\r\n      raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly\r\n      above their natural rate.\r\n\r\n      The price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be got.\r\n      The natural price, or the price of free competition, on the contrary, is\r\n      the lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion indeed, but for any\r\n      considerable time together. The one is upon every occasion the highest\r\n      which can be squeezed out of the buyers, or which it is supposed they will\r\n      consent to give; the other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly\r\n      afford to take, and at the same time continue their business.\r\n\r\n      The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and\r\n      all those laws which restrain in particular employments, the competition\r\n      to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same\r\n      tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies,\r\n      and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of\r\n      employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the\r\n      natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits\r\n      of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate.\r\n\r\n      Such enhancements of the market price may last as long as the regulations\r\n      of policy which give occasion to them.\r\n\r\n      The market price of any particular commodity, though it may continue long\r\n      above, can seldom continue long below, its natural price. Whatever part of\r\n      it was paid below the natural rate, the persons whose interest it affected\r\n      would immediately feel the loss, and would immediately withdraw either so\r\n      much land or so much labour, or so much stock, from being employed about\r\n      it, that the quantity brought to market would soon be no more than\r\n      sufficient to supply the effectual demand. Its market price, therefore,\r\n      would soon rise to the natural price; this at least would be the case\r\n      where there was perfect liberty.\r\n\r\n      The same statutes of apprenticeship and other corporation laws, indeed,\r\n      which, when a manufacture is in prosperity, enable the workman to raise\r\n      his wages a good deal above their natural rate, sometimes oblige him, when\r\n      it decays, to let them down a good deal below it. As in the one case they\r\n      exclude many people from his employment, so in the other they exclude him\r\n      from many employments. The effect of such regulations, however, is not\r\n      near so durable in sinking the workman’s wages below, as in raising them\r\n      above their natural rate. Their operation in the one way may endure for\r\n      many centuries, but in the other it can last no longer than the lives of\r\n      some of the workmen who were bred to the business in the time of its\r\n      prosperity. When they are gone, the number of those who are afterwards\r\n      educated to the trade will naturally suit itself to the effectual demand.\r\n      The policy must be as violent as that of Indostan or ancient Egypt (where\r\n      every man was bound by a principle of religion to follow the occupation of\r\n      his father, and was supposed to commit the most horrid sacrilege if he\r\n      changed it for another), which can in any particular employment, and for\r\n      several generations together, sink either the wages of labour or the\r\n      profits of stock below their natural rate.\r\n\r\n      This is all that I think necessary to be observed at present concerning\r\n      the deviations, whether occasional or permanent, of the market price of\r\n      commodities from the natural price.\r\n\r\n      The natural price itself varies with the natural rate of each of its\r\n      component parts, of wages, profit, and rent; and in every society this\r\n      rate varies according to their circumstances, according to their riches or\r\n      poverty, their advancing, stationary, or declining condition. I shall, in\r\n      the four following chapters, endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly\r\n      as I can, the causes of those different variations.\r\n\r\n      First, I shall endeavour to explain what are the circumstances which\r\n      naturally determine the rate of wages, and in what manner those\r\n      circumstances are affected by the riches or poverty, by the advancing,\r\n      stationary, or declining state of the society.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, I shall endeavour to shew what are the circumstances which\r\n      naturally determine the rate of profit; and in what manner, too, those\r\n      circumstances are affected by the like variations in the state of the\r\n      society.\r\n\r\n      Though pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different\r\n      employments of labour and stock; yet a certain proportion seems commonly\r\n      to take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different\r\n      employments of labour, and the pecuniary profits in all the different\r\n      employments of stock. This proportion, it will appear hereafter, depends\r\n      partly upon the nature of the different employments, and partly upon the\r\n      different laws and policy of the society in which they are carried on. But\r\n      though in many respects dependent upon the laws and policy, this\r\n      proportion seems to be little affected by the riches or poverty of that\r\n      society, by its advancing, stationary, or declining condition, but to\r\n      remain the same, or very nearly the same, in all those different states. I\r\n      shall, in the third place, endeavour to explain all the different\r\n      circumstances which regulate this proportion.\r\n\r\n      In the fourth and last place, I shall endeavour to shew what are the\r\n      circumstances which regulate the rent of land, and which either raise or\r\n      lower the real price of all the different substances which it produces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nOF THE WAGES OF LABOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The produce of labour constitutes the natural recompence or wages of\r\n      labour. In that original state of things which precedes both the\r\n      appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of\r\n      labour belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to\r\n      share with him.\r\n\r\n      Had this state continued, the wages of labour would have augmented with\r\n      all those improvements in its productive powers, to which the division of\r\n      labour gives occasion. All things would gradually have become cheaper.\r\n      They would have been produced by a smaller quantity of labour; and as the\r\n      commodities produced by equal quantities of labour would naturally in this\r\n      state of things be exchanged for one another, they would have been\r\n      purchased likewise with the produce of a smaller quantity.\r\n\r\n      But though all things would have become cheaper in reality, in appearance\r\n      many things might have become dearer, than before, or have been exchanged\r\n      for a greater quantity of other goods. Let us suppose, for example, that\r\n      in the greater part of employments the productive powers of labour had\r\n      been improved to tenfold, or that a day’s labour could produce ten times\r\n      the quantity of work which it had done originally; but that in a\r\n      particular employment they had been improved only to double, or that a\r\n      day’s labour could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had\r\n      done before. In exchanging the produce of a day’s labour in the greater\r\n      part of employments for that of a day’s labour in this particular one, ten\r\n      times the original quantity of work in them would purchase only twice the\r\n      original quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound\r\n      weight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In\r\n      reality, however, it would be twice as cheap. Though it required five\r\n      times the quantity of other goods to purchase it, it would require only\r\n      half the quantity of labour either to purchase or to produce it. The\r\n      acquisition, therefore, would be twice as easy as before.\r\n\r\n      But this original state of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the whole\r\n      produce of his own labour, could not last beyond the first introduction of\r\n      the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock. It was at an end,\r\n      therefore, long before the most considerable improvements were made in the\r\n      productive powers of labour; and it would be to no purpose to trace\r\n      further what might have been its effects upon the recompence or wages of\r\n      labour.\r\n\r\n      As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a share of\r\n      almost all the produce which the labourer can either raise or collect from\r\n      it. His rent makes the first deduction from the produce of the labour\r\n      which is employed upon land.\r\n\r\n      It seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has wherewithal to\r\n      maintain himself till he reaps the harvest. His maintenance is generally\r\n      advanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who employs him,\r\n      and who would have no interest to employ him, unless he was to share in\r\n      the produce of his labour, or unless his stock was to be replaced to him\r\n      with a profit. This profit makes a second deduction from the produce of\r\n      the labour which is employed upon land.\r\n\r\n      The produce of almost all other labour is liable to the like deduction of\r\n      profit. In all arts and manufactures, the greater part of the workmen\r\n      stand in need of a master, to advance them the materials of their work,\r\n      and their wages and maintenance, till it be completed. He shares in the\r\n      produce of their labour, or in the value which it adds to the materials\r\n      upon which it is bestowed; and in this share consists his profit.\r\n\r\n      It sometimes happens, indeed, that a single independent workman has stock\r\n      sufficient both to purchase the materials of his work, and to maintain\r\n      himself till it be completed. He is both master and workman, and enjoys\r\n      the whole produce of his own labour, or the whole value which it adds to\r\n      the materials upon which it is bestowed. It includes what are usually two\r\n      distinct revenues, belonging to two distinct persons, the profits of\r\n      stock, and the wages of labour.\r\n\r\n      Such cases, however, are not very frequent; and in every part of Europe\r\n      twenty workmen serve under a master for one that is independent, and the\r\n      wages of labour are everywhere understood to be, what they usually are,\r\n      when the labourer is one person, and the owner of the stock which employs\r\n      him another.\r\n\r\n      What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract\r\n      usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means\r\n      the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as\r\n      little, as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise,\r\n      the latter in order to lower, the wages of labour.\r\n\r\n      It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must,\r\n      upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force\r\n      the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in\r\n      number, can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or\r\n      at least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those\r\n      of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower\r\n      the price of work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such\r\n      disputes, the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a\r\n      master manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single\r\n      workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, which they\r\n      have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could\r\n      subsist a month, and scarce any a year, without employment. In the long\r\n      run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to\r\n      him; but the necessity is not so immediate.\r\n\r\n      We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though\r\n      frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account,\r\n      that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the\r\n      subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but\r\n      constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above\r\n      their actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most\r\n      unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours\r\n      and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the\r\n      usual, and, one may say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever\r\n      hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to\r\n      sink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted\r\n      with the utmost silence and secrecy till the moment of execution; and when\r\n      the workmen yield, as they sometimes do without resistance, though\r\n      severely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people. Such\r\n      combinations, however, are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive\r\n      combination of the workmen, who sometimes, too, without any provocation of\r\n      this kind, combine, of their own accord, to raise the price of their\r\n      labour. Their usual pretences are, sometimes the high price of provisions,\r\n      sometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work. But\r\n      whether their combinations be offensive or defensive, they are always\r\n      abundantly heard of. In order to bring the point to a speedy decision,\r\n      they have always recourse to the loudest clamour, and sometimes to the\r\n      most shocking violence and outrage. They are desperate, and act with the\r\n      folly and extravagance of desperate men, who must either starve, or\r\n      frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands.\r\n      The masters, upon these occasions, are just as clamorous upon the other\r\n      side, and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil\r\n      magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been\r\n      enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants,\r\n      labourers, and journeymen. The workmen, accordingly, very seldom derive\r\n      any advantage from the violence of those tumultuous combinations, which,\r\n      partly from the interposition of the civil magistrate, partly from the\r\n      superior steadiness of the masters, partly from the necessity which the\r\n      greater part of the workmen are under of submitting for the sake of\r\n      present subsistence, generally end in nothing but the punishment or ruin\r\n      of the ringleaders.\r\n\r\n      But though, in disputes with their workmen, masters must generally have\r\n      the advantage, there is, however, a certain rate, below which it seems\r\n      impossible to reduce, for any considerable time, the ordinary wages even\r\n      of the lowest species of labour.\r\n\r\n      A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be\r\n      sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat\r\n      more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and\r\n      the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation. Mr\r\n      Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest species of\r\n      common labourers must everywhere earn at least double their own\r\n      maintenance, in order that, one with another, they may be enabled to bring\r\n      up two children; the labour of the wife, on account of her necessary\r\n      attendance on the children, being supposed no more than sufficient to\r\n      provide for herself: But one half the children born, it is computed, die\r\n      before the age of manhood. The poorest labourers, therefore, according to\r\n      this account, must, one with another, attempt to rear at least four\r\n      children, in order that two may have an equal chance of living to that\r\n      age. But the necessary maintenance of four children, it is supposed, may\r\n      be nearly equal to that of one man. The labour of an able-bodied slave,\r\n      the same author adds, is computed to be worth double his maintenance; and\r\n      that of the meanest labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth less than that of\r\n      an able-bodied slave. Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to\r\n      bring up a family, the labour of the husband and wife together must, even\r\n      in the lowest species of common labour, be able to earn something more\r\n      than what is precisely necessary for their own maintenance; but in what\r\n      proportion, whether in that above-mentioned, or any other, I shall not\r\n      take upon me to determine.\r\n\r\n      There are certain circumstances, however, which sometimes give the\r\n      labourers an advantage, and enable them to raise their wages considerably\r\n      above this rate, evidently the lowest which is consistent with common\r\n      humanity.\r\n\r\n      When in any country the demand for those who live by wages, labourers,\r\n      journeymen, servants of every kind, is continually increasing; when every\r\n      year furnishes employment for a greater number than had been employed the\r\n      year before, the workmen have no occasion to combine in order to raise\r\n      their wages. The scarcity of hands occasions a competition among masters,\r\n      who bid against one another in order to get workmen, and thus voluntarily\r\n      break through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages. The\r\n      demand for those who live by wages, it is evident, cannot increase but in\r\n      proportion to the increase of the funds which are destined to the payment\r\n      of wages. These funds are of two kinds, first, the revenue which is over\r\n      and above what is necessary for the maintenance; and, secondly, the stock\r\n      which is over and above what is necessary for the employment of their\r\n      masters.\r\n\r\n      When the landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue than\r\n      what he judges sufficient to maintain his own family, he employs either\r\n      the whole or a part of the surplus in maintaining one or more menial\r\n      servants. Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the number\r\n      of those servants.\r\n\r\n      When an independent workman, such as a weaver or shoemaker, has got more\r\n      stock than what is sufficient to purchase the materials of his own work,\r\n      and to maintain himself till he can dispose of it, he naturally employs\r\n      one or more journeymen with the surplus, in order to make a profit by\r\n      their work. Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the\r\n      number of his journeymen.\r\n\r\n      The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, necessarily increases\r\n      with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and cannot\r\n      possibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is the\r\n      increase of national wealth. The demand for those who live by wages,\r\n      therefore, naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and\r\n      cannot possibly increase without it.\r\n\r\n      It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual\r\n      increase, which occasions a rise in the wages of labour. It is not,\r\n      accordingly, in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in\r\n      those which are growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are\r\n      highest. England is certainly, in the present times, a much richer country\r\n      than any part of North America. The wages of labour, however, are much\r\n      higher in North America than in any part of England. In the province of\r\n      New York, common labourers earned in 1773, before the commencement of the\r\n      late disturbances, three shillings and sixpence currency, equal to two\r\n      shillings sterling, a-day; ship-carpenters, ten shillings and sixpence\r\n      currency, with a pint of rum, worth sixpence sterling, equal in all to six\r\n      shillings and sixpence sterling; house-carpenters and bricklayers, eight\r\n      shillings currency, equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling;\r\n      journeymen tailors, five shillings currency, equal to about two shillings\r\n      and tenpence sterling. These prices are all above the London price; and\r\n      wages are said to be as high in the other colonies as in New York. The\r\n      price of provisions is everywhere in North America much lower than in\r\n      England. A dearth has never been known there. In the worst seasons they\r\n      have always had a sufficiency for themselves, though less for exportation.\r\n      If the money price of labour, therefore, be higher than it is anywhere in\r\n      the mother-country, its real price, the real command of the necessaries\r\n      and conveniencies of life which it conveys to the labourer, must be higher\r\n      in a still greater proportion.\r\n\r\n      But though North America is not yet so rich as England, it is much more\r\n      thriving, and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further\r\n      acquisition of riches. The most decisive mark of the prosperity of any\r\n      country is the increase of the number of its inhabitants. In Great\r\n      Britain, and most other European countries, they are not supposed to\r\n      double in less than five hundred years. In the British colonies in North\r\n      America, it has been found that they double in twenty or five-and-twenty\r\n      years. Nor in the present times is this increase principally owing to the\r\n      continual importation of new inhabitants, but to the great multiplication\r\n      of the species. Those who live to old age, it is said, frequently see\r\n      there from fifty to a hundred, and sometimes many more, descendants from\r\n      their own body. Labour is there so well rewarded, that a numerous family\r\n      of children, instead of being a burden, is a source of opulence and\r\n      prosperity to the parents. The labour of each child, before it can leave\r\n      their house, is computed to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them.\r\n      A young widow with four or five young children, who, among the middling or\r\n      inferior ranks of people in Europe, would have so little chance for a\r\n      second husband, is there frequently courted as a sort of fortune. The\r\n      value of children is the greatest of all encouragements to marriage. We\r\n      cannot, therefore, wonder that the people in North America should\r\n      generally marry very young. Notwithstanding the great increase occasioned\r\n      by such early marriages, there is a continual complaint of the scarcity of\r\n      hands in North America. The demand for labourers, the funds destined for\r\n      maintaining them increase, it seems, still faster than they can find\r\n      labourers to employ.\r\n\r\n      Though the wealth of a country should be very great, yet if it has been\r\n      long stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour very high\r\n      in it. The funds destined for the payment of wages, the revenue and stock\r\n      of its inhabitants, may be of the greatest extent; but if they have\r\n      continued for several centuries of the same, or very nearly of the same\r\n      extent, the number of labourers employed every year could easily supply,\r\n      and even more than supply, the number wanted the following year. There\r\n      could seldom be any scarcity of hands, nor could the masters be obliged to\r\n      bid against one another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary,\r\n      would, in this case, naturally multiply beyond their employment. There\r\n      would be a constant scarcity of employment, and the labourers would be\r\n      obliged to bid against one another in order to get it. If in such a\r\n      country the wages of labour had ever been more than sufficient to\r\n      maintain the labourer, and to enable him to bring up a family, the\r\n      competition of the labourers and the interest of the masters would soon\r\n      reduce them to the lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity.\r\n      China has been long one of the richest, that is, one of the most fertile,\r\n      best cultivated, most industrious, and most populous, countries in the\r\n      world. It seems, however, to have been long stationary. Marco Polo, who\r\n      visited it more than five hundred years ago, describes its cultivation,\r\n      industry, and populousness, almost in the same terms in which they are\r\n      described by travellers in the present times. It had, perhaps, even long\r\n      before his time, acquired that full complement of riches which the nature\r\n      of its laws and institutions permits it to acquire. The accounts of all\r\n      travellers, inconsistent in many other respects, agree in the low wages of\r\n      labour, and in the difficulty which a labourer finds in bringing up a\r\n      family in China. If by digging the ground a whole day he can get what will\r\n      purchase a small quantity of rice in the evening, he is contented. The\r\n      condition of artificers is, if possible, still worse. Instead of waiting\r\n      indolently in their work-houses for the calls of their customers, as in\r\n      Europe, they are continually running about the streets with the tools of\r\n      their respective trades, offering their services, and, as it were, begging\r\n      employment. The poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far\r\n      surpasses that of the most beggarly nations in Europe. In the\r\n      neighbourhood of Canton, many hundred, it is commonly said, many thousand\r\n      families have no habitation on the land, but live constantly in little\r\n      fishing-boats upon the rivers and canals. The subsistence which they find\r\n      there is so scanty, that they are eager to fish up the nastiest garbage\r\n      thrown overboard from any European ship. Any carrion, the carcase of a\r\n      dead dog or cat, for example, though half putrid and stinking, is as\r\n      welcome to them as the most wholesome food to the people of other\r\n      countries. Marriage is encouraged in China, not by the profitableness of\r\n      children, but by the liberty of destroying them. In all great towns,\r\n      several are every night exposed in the street, or drowned like puppies in\r\n      the water. The performance of this horrid office is even said to be the\r\n      avowed business by which some people earn their subsistence.\r\n\r\n      China, however, though it may, perhaps, stand still, does not seem to go\r\n      backwards. Its towns are nowhere deserted by their inhabitants. The lands\r\n      which had once been cultivated, are nowhere neglected. The same, or very\r\n      nearly the same, annual labour, must, therefore, continue to be performed,\r\n      and the funds destined for maintaining it must not, consequently, be\r\n      sensibly diminished. The lowest class of labourers, therefore,\r\n      notwithstanding their scanty subsistence, must some way or another make\r\n      shift to continue their race so far as to keep up their usual numbers.\r\n\r\n      But it would be otherwise in a country where the funds destined for the\r\n      maintenance of labour were sensibly decaying. Every year the demand for\r\n      servants and labourers would, in all the different classes of employments,\r\n      be less than it had been the year before. Many who had been bred in the\r\n      superior classes, not being able to find employment in their own business,\r\n      would be glad to seek it in the lowest. The lowest class being not only\r\n      overstocked with its own workmen, but with the overflowings of all the\r\n      other classes, the competition for employment would be so great in it, as\r\n      to reduce the wages of labour to the most miserable and scanty subsistence\r\n      of the labourer. Many would not be able to find employment even upon these\r\n      hard terms, but would either starve, or be driven to seek a subsistence,\r\n      either by begging, or by the perpetration perhaps, of the greatest\r\n      enormities. Want, famine, and mortality, would immediately prevail in that\r\n      class, and from thence extend themselves to all the superior classes, till\r\n      the number of inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could easily\r\n      be maintained by the revenue and stock which remained in it, and which had\r\n      escaped either the tyranny or calamity which had destroyed the rest. This,\r\n      perhaps, is nearly the present state of Bengal, and of some other of the\r\n      English settlements in the East Indies. In a fertile country, which had\r\n      before been much depopulated, where subsistence, consequently, should not\r\n      be very difficult, and where, notwithstanding, three or four hundred\r\n      thousand people die of hunger in one year, we may be assured that the funds\r\n      destined for the maintenance of the labouring poor are fast decaying. The\r\n      difference between the genius of the British constitution, which protects\r\n      and governs North America, and that of the mercantile company which\r\n      oppresses and domineers in the East Indies, cannot, perhaps, be better\r\n      illustrated than by the different state of those countries.\r\n\r\n      The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the necessary effect, so\r\n      it is the natural symptom of increasing national wealth. The scanty\r\n      maintenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural\r\n      symptom that things are at a stand, and their starving condition, that\r\n      they are going fast backwards.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, the wages of labour seem, in the present times, to be\r\n      evidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the labourer to\r\n      bring up a family. In order to satisfy ourselves upon this point, it will\r\n      not be necessary to enter into any tedious or doubtful calculation of what\r\n      may be the lowest sum upon which it is possible to do this. There are many\r\n      plain symptoms, that the wages of labour are nowhere in this country\r\n      regulated by this lowest rate, which is consistent with common humanity.\r\n\r\n      First, in almost every part of Great Britain there is a distinction, even\r\n      in the lowest species of labour, between summer and winter wages. Summer\r\n      wages are always highest. But, on account of the extraordinary expense of\r\n      fuel, the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter. Wages,\r\n      therefore, being highest when this expense is lowest, it seems evident\r\n      that they are not regulated by what is necessary for this expense, but by\r\n      the quantity and supposed value of the work. A labourer, it may be said,\r\n      indeed, ought to save part of his summer wages, in order to defray his\r\n      winter expense; and that, through the whole year, they do not exceed what\r\n      is necessary to maintain his family through the whole year. A slave,\r\n      however, or one absolutely dependent on us for immediate subsistence,\r\n      would not be treated in this manner. His daily subsistence would be\r\n      proportioned to his daily necessities.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, the wages of labour do not, in Great Britain, fluctuate with the\r\n      price of provisions. These vary everywhere from year to year, frequently\r\n      from month to month. But in many places, the money price of labour remains\r\n      uniformly the same, sometimes for half a century together. If, in these\r\n      places, therefore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in dear\r\n      years, they must be at their ease in times of moderate plenty, and in\r\n      affluence in those of extraordinary cheapness. The high price of\r\n      provisions during these ten years past, has not, in many parts of the\r\n      kingdom, been accompanied with any sensible rise in the money price of\r\n      labour. It has, indeed, in some; owing, probably, more to the increase of\r\n      the demand for labour, than to that of the price of provisions.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than the\r\n      wages of labour, so, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more from\r\n      place to place than the price of provisions. The prices of bread and\r\n      butchers’ meat are generally the same, or very nearly the same, through\r\n      the greater part of the united kingdom. These, and most other things which\r\n      are sold by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all things,\r\n      are generally fully as cheap, or cheaper, in great towns than in the\r\n      remoter parts of the country, for reasons which I shall have occasion to\r\n      explain hereafter. But the wages of labour in a great town and its\r\n      neighbourhood are frequently a fourth or a fifth part, twenty or five-and—twenty\r\n      per cent. higher than at a few miles distance. Eighteen pence a day may be\r\n      reckoned the common price of labour in London and its neighbourhood. At a\r\n      few miles distance, it falls to fourteen and fifteen pence. Tenpence may\r\n      be reckoned its price in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood. At a few miles\r\n      distance, it falls to eightpence, the usual price of common labour through\r\n      the greater part of the low country of Scotland, where it varies a good\r\n      deal less than in England. Such a difference of prices, which, it seems,\r\n      is not always sufficient to transport a man from one parish to another,\r\n      would necessarily occasion so great a transportation of the most bulky\r\n      commodities, not only from one parish to another, but from one end of the\r\n      kingdom, almost from one end of the world to the other, as would soon\r\n      reduce them more nearly to a level. After all that has been said of the\r\n      levity and inconstancy of human nature, it appears evidently from\r\n      experience, that man is, of all sorts of luggage, the most difficult to be\r\n      transported. If the labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families\r\n      in those parts of the kingdom where the price of labour is lowest, they\r\n      must be in affluence where it is highest.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, the variations in the price of labour not only do not\r\n      correspond, either in place or time, with those in the price of\r\n      provisions, but they are frequently quite opposite.\r\n\r\n      Grain, the food of the common people, is dearer in Scotland than in\r\n      England, whence Scotland receives almost every year very large supplies.\r\n      But English corn must be sold dearer in Scotland, the country to which it\r\n      is brought, than in England, the country from which it comes; and in\r\n      proportion to its quality it cannot be sold dearer in Scotland than the\r\n      Scotch corn that comes to the same market in competition with it. The\r\n      quality of grain depends chiefly upon the quantity of flour or meal which\r\n      it yields at the mill; and, in this respect, English grain is so much\r\n      superior to the Scotch, that though often dearer in appearance, or in\r\n      proportion to the measure of its bulk, it is generally cheaper in reality,\r\n      or in proportion to its quality, or even to the measure of its weight. The\r\n      price of labour, on the contrary, is dearer in England than in Scotland.\r\n      If the labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families in the one\r\n      part of the united kingdom, they must be in affluence in the other.\r\n      Oatmeal, indeed, supplies the common people in Scotland with the greatest\r\n      and the best part of their food, which is, in general, much inferior to\r\n      that of their neighbours of the same rank in England. This difference,\r\n      however, in the mode of their subsistence, is not the cause, but the\r\n      effect, of the difference in their wages; though, by a strange\r\n      misapprehension, I have frequently heard it represented as the cause. It\r\n      is not because one man keeps a coach, while his neighbour walks a-foot,\r\n      that the one is rich, and the other poor; but because the one is rich, he\r\n      keeps a coach, and because the other is poor, he walks a-foot.\r\n\r\n      During the course of the last century, taking one year with another, grain\r\n      was dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the\r\n      present. This is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of any reasonable\r\n      doubt; and the proof of it is, if possible, still more decisive with\r\n      regard to Scotland than with regard to England. It is in Scotland\r\n      supported by the evidence of the public fiars, annual valuations made upon\r\n      oath, according to the actual state of the markets, of all the different\r\n      sorts of grain in every different county of Scotland. If such direct proof\r\n      could require any collateral evidence to confirm it, I would observe, that\r\n      this has likewise been the case in France, and probably in most other\r\n      parts of Europe. With regard to France, there is the clearest proof. But\r\n      though it is certain, that in both parts of the united kingdom grain was\r\n      somewhat dearer in the last century than in the present, it is equally\r\n      certain that labour was much cheaper. If the labouring poor, therefore,\r\n      could bring up their families then, they must be much more at their ease\r\n      now. In the last century, the most usual day-wages of common labour\r\n      through the greater part of Scotland were sixpence in summer, and\r\n      fivepence in winter. Three shillings a-week, the same price, very nearly\r\n      still continues to be paid in some parts of the Highlands and Western\r\n      islands. Through the greater part of the Low country, the most usual wages\r\n      of common labour are now eight pence a-day; tenpence, sometimes a\r\n      shilling, about Edinburgh, in the counties which border upon England,\r\n      probably on account of that neighbourhood, and in a few other places where\r\n      there has lately been a considerable rise in the demand for labour, about\r\n      Glasgow, Carron, Ayrshire, etc. In England, the improvements of\r\n      agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, began much earlier than in\r\n      Scotland. The demand for labour, and consequently its price, must\r\n      necessarily have increased with those improvements. In the last century,\r\n      accordingly, as well as in the present, the wages of labour were higher in\r\n      England than in Scotland. They have risen, too, considerably since that\r\n      time, though, on account of the greater variety of wages paid there in\r\n      different places, it is more difficult to ascertain how much. In 1614, the\r\n      pay of a foot soldier was the same as in the present times, eightpence\r\n      a-day. When it was first established, it would naturally be regulated by\r\n      the usual wages of common labourers, the rank of people from which foot\r\n      soldiers are commonly drawn. Lord-chief-justice Hales, who wrote in the\r\n      time of Charles II. computes the necessary expense of a labourer’s family,\r\n      consisting of six persons, the father and mother, two children able to do\r\n      something, and two not able, at ten shillings a-week, or twenty-six pounds\r\n      a-year. If they cannot earn this by their labour, they must make it up, he\r\n      supposes, either by begging or stealing. He appears to have enquired very\r\n      carefully into this subject {See his scheme for the maintenance of the\r\n      poor, in Burn’s History of the Poor Laws.}. In 1688, Mr Gregory King,\r\n      whose skill in political arithmetic is so much extolled by Dr Davenant,\r\n      computed the ordinary income of labourers and out-servants to be fifteen\r\n      pounds a-year to a family, which he supposed to consist, one with another,\r\n      of three and a half persons. His calculation, therefore, though different\r\n      in appearance, corresponds very nearly at bottom with that of Judge Hales.\r\n      Both suppose the weekly expense of such families to be about twenty-pence\r\n      a-head. Both the pecuniary income and expense of such families have\r\n      increased considerably since that time through the greater part of the\r\n      kingdom, in some places more, and in some less, though perhaps scarce\r\n      anywhere so much as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of\r\n      labour have lately represented them to the public. The price of labour, it\r\n      must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere,\r\n      different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort\r\n      of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workman,\r\n      but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are\r\n      not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is, what are\r\n      the most usual; and experience seems to shew that law can never regulate\r\n      them properly, though it has often pretended to do so.\r\n\r\n      The real recompence of labour, the real quantity of the necessaries and\r\n      conveniencies of life which it can procure to the labourer, has, during\r\n      the course of the present century, increased perhaps in a still greater\r\n      proportion than its money price. Not only grain has become somewhat\r\n      cheaper, but many other things, from which the industrious poor derive an\r\n      agreeable and wholesome variety of food, have become a great deal cheaper.\r\n      Potatoes, for example, do not at present, through the greater part of the\r\n      kingdom, cost half the price which they used to do thirty or forty years\r\n      ago. The same thing may be said of turnips, carrots, cabbages; things\r\n      which were formerly never raised but by the spade, but which are now\r\n      commonly raised by the plough. All sort of garden stuff, too, has become\r\n      cheaper. The greater part of the apples, and even of the onions, consumed\r\n      in Great Britain, were, in the last century, imported from Flanders. The\r\n      great improvements in the coarser manufactories of both linen and woollen\r\n      cloth furnish the labourers with cheaper and better clothing; and those in\r\n      the manufactories of the coarser metals, with cheaper and better\r\n      instruments of trade, as well as with many agreeable and convenient pieces\r\n      of household furniture. Soap, salt, candles, leather, and fermented\r\n      liquors, have, indeed, become a good deal dearer, chiefly from the taxes\r\n      which have been laid upon them. The quantity of these, however, which the\r\n      labouring poor are under any necessity of consuming, is so very small, that\r\n      the increase in their price does not compensate the diminution in that of\r\n      so many other things. The common complaint, that luxury extends itself\r\n      even to the lowest ranks of the people, and that the labouring poor will\r\n      not now be contented with the same food, clothing, and lodging, which\r\n      satisfied them in former times, may convince us that it is not the money\r\n      price of labour only, but its real recompence, which has augmented.\r\n\r\n      Is this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the people\r\n      to be regarded as an advantage, or as an inconveniency, to the society?\r\n      The answer seems at first abundantly plain. Servants, labourers, and\r\n      workmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every great\r\n      political society. But what improves the circumstances of the greater\r\n      part, can never be regarded as any inconveniency to the whole. No society\r\n      can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the\r\n      members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who\r\n      feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a\r\n      share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably\r\n      well fed, clothed, and lodged.\r\n\r\n      Poverty, though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent,\r\n      marriage. It seems even to be favourable to generation. A half-starved\r\n      Highland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a\r\n      pampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is generally\r\n      exhausted by two or three. Barrenness, so frequent among women of fashion,\r\n      is very rare among those of inferior station. Luxury, in the fair sex,\r\n      while it inflames, perhaps, the passion for enjoyment, seems always to\r\n      weaken, and frequently to destroy altogether, the powers of generation.\r\n\r\n      But poverty, though it does not prevent the generation, is extremely\r\n      unfavourable to the rearing of children. The tender plant is produced; but\r\n      in so cold a soil, and so severe a climate, soon withers and dies. It is\r\n      not uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of Scotland,\r\n      for a mother who has born twenty children not to have two alive. Several\r\n      officers of great experience have assured me, that, so far from recruiting\r\n      their regiment, they have never been able to supply it with drums and\r\n      fifes, from all the soldiers’ children that were born in it. A greater\r\n      number of fine children, however, is seldom seen anywhere than about a\r\n      barrack of soldiers. Very few of them, it seems, arrive at the age of\r\n      thirteen or fourteen. In some places, one half the children die before\r\n      they are four years of age, in many places before they are seven, and in\r\n      almost all places before they are nine or ten. This great mortality,\r\n      however will everywhere be found chiefly among the children of the common\r\n      people, who cannot afford to tend them with the same care as those of\r\n      better station. Though their marriages are generally more fruitful than\r\n      those of people of fashion, a smaller proportion of their children arrive\r\n      at maturity. In foundling hospitals, and among the children brought up by\r\n      parish charities, the mortality is still greater than among those of the\r\n      common people.\r\n\r\n      Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the means\r\n      of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply beyond it. But in\r\n      civilized society, it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the\r\n      scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of\r\n      the human species; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a\r\n      great part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce.\r\n\r\n      The liberal reward of labour, by enabling them to provide better for their\r\n      children, and consequently to bring up a greater number, naturally tends\r\n      to widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be remarked, too, that it\r\n      necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which the\r\n      demand for labour requires. If this demand is continually increasing, the\r\n      reward of labour must necessarily encourage in such a manner the marriage\r\n      and multiplication of labourers, as may enable them to supply that\r\n      continually increasing demand by a continually increasing population. If\r\n      the reward should at any time be less than what was requisite for this\r\n      purpose, the deficiency of hands would soon raise it; and if it should at\r\n      any time be more, their excessive multiplication would soon lower it to\r\n      this necessary rate. The market would be so much understocked with labour\r\n      in the one case, and so much overstocked in the other, as would soon force\r\n      back its price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the society\r\n      required. It is in this manner that the demand for men, like that for any\r\n      other commodity, necessarily regulates the production of men, quickens it\r\n      when it goes on too slowly, and stops it when it advances too fast. It is\r\n      this demand which regulates and determines the state of propagation in all\r\n      the different countries of the world; in North America, in Europe, and in\r\n      China; which renders it rapidly progressive in the first, slow and gradual\r\n      in the second, and altogether stationary in the last.\r\n\r\n      The wear and tear of a slave, it has been said, is at the expense of his\r\n      master; but that of a free servant is at his own expense. The wear and\r\n      tear of the latter, however, is, in reality, as much at the expense of his\r\n      master as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of\r\n      every kind must be such as may enable them, one with another to continue\r\n      the race of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing,\r\n      diminishing, or stationary demand of the society, may happen to require.\r\n      But though the wear and tear of a free servant be equally at the expense\r\n      of his master, it generally costs him much less than that of a slave. The\r\n      fund destined for replacing or repairing, if I may say so, the wear and\r\n      tear of the slave, is commonly managed by a negligent master or careless\r\n      overseer. That destined for performing the same office with regard to the\r\n      freeman is managed by the freeman himself. The disorders which generally\r\n      prevail in the economy of the rich, naturally introduce themselves into\r\n      the management of the former; the strict frugality and parsimonious\r\n      attention of the poor as naturally establish themselves in that of the\r\n      latter. Under such different management, the same purpose must require\r\n      very different degrees of expense to execute it. It appears, accordingly,\r\n      from the experience of all ages and nations, I believe, that the work done\r\n      by freemen comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves. It is\r\n      found to do so even at Boston, New-York, and Philadelphia, where the wages\r\n      of common labour are so very high.\r\n\r\n      The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing\r\n      wealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it, is\r\n      to lament over the necessary cause and effect of the greatest public\r\n      prosperity.\r\n\r\n      It deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive state,\r\n      while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than\r\n      when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of\r\n      the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the\r\n      happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and\r\n      miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is, in reality,\r\n      the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the\r\n      society; the stationary is dull; the declining melancholy.\r\n\r\n      The liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it\r\n      increases the industry of the common people. The wages of labour are the\r\n      encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves\r\n      in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful subsistence\r\n      increases the bodily strength of the labourer, and the comfortable hope of\r\n      bettering his condition, and of ending his days, perhaps, in ease and\r\n      plenty, animates him to exert that strength to the utmost. Where wages are\r\n      high, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent,\r\n      and expeditious, than where they are low; in England, for example, than in\r\n      Scotland; in the neighbourhood of great towns, than in remote country\r\n      places. Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will\r\n      maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This,\r\n      however, is by no means the case with the greater part. Workmen, on the\r\n      contrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to\r\n      overwork themselves, and to ruin their health and constitution in a few\r\n      years. A carpenter in London, and in some other places, is not supposed to\r\n      last in his utmost vigour above eight years. Something of the same kind\r\n      happens in many other trades, in which the workmen are paid by the piece;\r\n      as they generally are in manufactures, and even in country labour,\r\n      wherever wages are higher than ordinary. Almost every class of artificers\r\n      is subject to some peculiar infirmity occasioned by excessive application\r\n      to their peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian\r\n      physician, has written a particular book concerning such diseases. We do\r\n      not reckon our soldiers the most industrious set of people among us; yet\r\n      when soldiers have been employed in some particular sorts of work, and\r\n      liberally paid by the piece, their officers have frequently been obliged\r\n      to stipulate with the undertaker, that they should not be allowed to earn\r\n      above a certain sum every day, according to the rate at which they were\r\n      paid. Till this stipulation was made, mutual emulation, and the desire of\r\n      greater gain, frequently prompted them to overwork themselves, and to hurt\r\n      their health by excessive labour. Excessive application, during four days\r\n      of the week, is frequently the real cause of the idleness of the other\r\n      three, so much and so loudly complained of. Great labour, either of mind\r\n      or body, continued for several days together is, in most men, naturally\r\n      followed by a great desire of relaxation, which, if not restrained by\r\n      force, or by some strong necessity, is almost irresistible. It is the call\r\n      of nature, which requires to be relieved by some indulgence, sometimes of\r\n      ease only, but sometimes too of dissipation and diversion. If it is not\r\n      complied with, the consequences are often dangerous and sometimes fatal,\r\n      and such as almost always, sooner or later, bring on the peculiar\r\n      infirmity of the trade. If masters would always listen to the dictates of\r\n      reason and humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to moderate,\r\n      than to animate the application of many of their workmen. It will be\r\n      found, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so\r\n      moderately, as to be able to work constantly, not only preserves his\r\n      health the longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest\r\n      quantity of work.\r\n\r\n      In cheap years it is pretended, workmen are generally more idle, and in\r\n      dear times more industrious than ordinary. A plentiful subsistence,\r\n      therefore, it has been concluded, relaxes, and a scanty one quickens their\r\n      industry. That a little more plenty than ordinary may render some workmen\r\n      idle, cannot be well doubted; but that it should have this effect upon the\r\n      greater part, or that men in general should work better when they are ill\r\n      fed, than when they are well fed, when they are disheartened than when\r\n      they are in good spirits, when they are frequently sick than when they are\r\n      generally in good health, seems not very probable. Years of dearth, it is\r\n      to be observed, are generally among the common people years of sickness\r\n      and mortality, which cannot fail to diminish the produce of their\r\n      industry.\r\n\r\n      In years of plenty, servants frequently leave their masters, and trust\r\n      their subsistence to what they can make by their own industry. But the\r\n      same cheapness of provisions, by increasing the fund which is destined for\r\n      the maintenance of servants, encourages masters, farmers especially, to\r\n      employ a greater number. Farmers, upon such occasions, expect more profit\r\n      from their corn by maintaining a few more labouring servants, than by\r\n      selling it at a low price in the market. The demand for servants\r\n      increases, while the number of those who offer to supply that demand\r\n      diminishes. The price of labour, therefore, frequently rises in cheap\r\n      years.\r\n\r\n      In years of scarcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make\r\n      all such people eager to return to service. But the high price of\r\n      provisions, by diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of\r\n      servants, disposes masters rather to diminish than to increase the number\r\n      of those they have. In dear years, too, poor independent workmen\r\n      frequently consume the little stock with which they had used to supply\r\n      themselves with the materials of their work, and are obliged to become\r\n      journeymen for subsistence. More people want employment than easily get\r\n      it; many are willing to take it upon lower terms than ordinary; and the\r\n      wages of both servants and journeymen frequently sink in dear years.\r\n\r\n      Masters of all sorts, therefore, frequently make better bargains with\r\n      their servants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble and\r\n      dependent in the former than in the latter. They naturally, therefore,\r\n      commend the former as more favourable to industry. Landlords and farmers,\r\n      besides, two of the largest classes of masters, have another reason for\r\n      being pleased with dear years. The rents of the one, and the profits of\r\n      the other, depend very much upon the price of provisions. Nothing can be\r\n      more absurd, however, than to imagine that men in general should work less\r\n      when they work for themselves, than when they work for other people. A\r\n      poor independent workman will generally be more industrious than even a\r\n      journeyman who works by the piece. The one enjoys the whole produce of his\r\n      own industry, the other shares it with his master. The one, in his\r\n      separate independent state, is less liable to the temptations of bad\r\n      company, which, in large manufactories, so frequently ruin the morals of\r\n      the other. The superiority of the independent workman over those servants\r\n      who are hired by the month or by the year, and whose wages and maintenance\r\n      are the same, whether they do much or do little, is likely to be still\r\n      greater. Cheap years tend to increase the proportion of independent\r\n      workmen to journeymen and servants of all kinds, and dear years to\r\n      diminish it.\r\n\r\n      A French author of great knowledge and ingenuity, Mr Messance, receiver of\r\n      the tallies in the election of St Etienne, endeavours to shew that the\r\n      poor do more work in cheap than in dear years, by comparing the quantity\r\n      and value of the goods made upon those different occasions in three\r\n      different manufactures; one of coarse woollens, carried on at Elbeuf; one\r\n      of linen, and another of silk, both which extend through the whole\r\n      generality of Rouen. It appears from his account, which is copied from the\r\n      registers of the public offices, that the quantity and value of the goods\r\n      made in all those three manufactories has generally been greater in cheap\r\n      than in dear years, and that it has always been greatest in the cheapest,\r\n      and least in the dearest years. All the three seem to be stationary\r\n      manufactures, or which, though their produce may vary somewhat from year\r\n      to year, are, upon the whole, neither going backwards nor forwards.\r\n\r\n      The manufacture of linen in Scotland, and that of coarse woollens in the\r\n      West Riding of Yorkshire, are growing manufactures, of which the produce\r\n      is generally, though with some variations, increasing both in quantity and\r\n      value. Upon examining, however, the accounts which have been published of\r\n      their annual produce, I have not been able to observe that its variations\r\n      have had any sensible connection with the dearness or cheapness of the\r\n      seasons. In 1740, a year of great scarcity, both manufactures, indeed,\r\n      appear to have declined very considerably. But in 1756, another year of\r\n      great scarcity, the Scotch manufactures made more than ordinary advances.\r\n      The Yorkshire manufacture, indeed, declined, and its produce did not rise\r\n      to what it had been in 1755, till 1766, after the repeal of the American\r\n      stamp act. In that and the following year, it greatly exceeded what it had\r\n      ever been before, and it has continued to advance ever since.\r\n\r\n      The produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessarily\r\n      depend, not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in the\r\n      countries where they are carried on, as upon the circumstances which\r\n      affect the demand in the countries where they are consumed; upon peace or\r\n      war, upon the prosperity or declension of other rival manufactures and\r\n      upon the good or bad humour of their principal customers. A great part of\r\n      the extraordinary work, besides, which is probably done in cheap years,\r\n      never enters the public registers of manufactures. The men-servants, who\r\n      leave their masters, become independent labourers. The women return to\r\n      their parents, and commonly spin, in order to make clothes for themselves\r\n      and their families. Even the independent workmen do not always work for\r\n      public sale, but are employed by some of their neighbours in manufactures\r\n      for family use. The produce of their labour, therefore, frequently makes\r\n      no figure in those public registers, of which the records are sometimes\r\n      published with so much parade, and from which our merchants and\r\n      manufacturers would often vainly pretend to announce the prosperity or\r\n      declension of the greatest empires.\r\n\r\n      Though the variations in the price of labour not only do not always\r\n      correspond with those in the price of provisions, but are frequently quite\r\n      opposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price of\r\n      provisions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of labour\r\n      is necessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for labour, and\r\n      the price of the necessaries and conveniencies of life. The demand for\r\n      labour, according as it happens to be increasing, stationary, or\r\n      declining, or to require an increasing, stationary, or declining\r\n      population, determines the quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies\r\n      of life which must be given to the labourer; and the money price of labour\r\n      is determined by what is requisite for purchasing this quantity. Though\r\n      the money price of labour, therefore, is sometimes high where the price of\r\n      provisions is low, it would be still higher, the demand continuing the\r\n      same, if the price of provisions was high.\r\n\r\n      It is because the demand for labour increases in years of sudden and\r\n      extraordinary plenty, and diminishes in those of sudden and extraordinary\r\n      scarcity, that the money price of labour sometimes rises in the one, and\r\n      sinks in the other.\r\n\r\n      In a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the hands\r\n      of many of the employers of industry, sufficient to maintain and employ a\r\n      greater number of industrious people than had been employed the year\r\n      before; and this extraordinary number cannot always be had. Those masters,\r\n      therefore, who want more workmen, bid against one another, in order to get\r\n      them, which sometimes raises both the real and the money price of their\r\n      labour.\r\n\r\n      The contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary\r\n      scarcity. The funds destined for employing industry are less than they had\r\n      been the year before. A considerable number of people are thrown out of\r\n      employment, who bid one against another, in order to get it, which\r\n      sometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a\r\n      year of extraordinary scarcity, many people were willing to work for bare\r\n      subsistence. In the succeeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to\r\n      get labourers and servants. The scarcity of a dear year, by diminishing\r\n      the demand for labour, tends to lower its price, as the high price of\r\n      provisions tends to raise it. The plenty of a cheap year, on the contrary,\r\n      by increasing the demand, tends to raise the price of labour, as the\r\n      cheapness of provisions tends to lower it. In the ordinary variations of\r\n      the prices of provisions, those two opposite causes seem to counterbalance\r\n      one another, which is probably, in part, the reason why the wages of\r\n      labour are everywhere so much more steady and permanent than the price of\r\n      provisions.\r\n\r\n      The increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the price of\r\n      many commodities, by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into\r\n      wages, and so far tends to diminish their consumption, both at home and\r\n      abroad. The same cause, however, which raises the wages of labour, the\r\n      increase of stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a\r\n      smaller quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work. The owner\r\n      of the stock which employs a great number of labourers necessarily\r\n      endeavours, for his own advantage, to make such a proper division and\r\n      distribution of employment, that they may be enabled to produce the\r\n      greatest quantity of work possible. For the same reason, he endeavours to\r\n      supply them with the best machinery which either he or they can think of.\r\n      What takes place among the labourers in a particular workhouse, takes\r\n      place, for the same reason, among those of a great society. The greater\r\n      their number, the more they naturally divide themselves into different\r\n      classes and subdivisions of employments. More heads are occupied in\r\n      inventing the most proper machinery for executing the work of each, and it\r\n      is, therefore, more likely to be invented. There are many commodities,\r\n      therefore, which, in consequence of these improvements, come to be\r\n      produced by so much less labour than before, that the increase of its\r\n      price is more than compensated by the diminution of its quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nOF THE PROFITS OF STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same causes with\r\n      the rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or declining\r\n      state of the wealth of the society; but those causes affect the one and\r\n      the other very differently.\r\n\r\n      The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the\r\n      stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual\r\n      competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is a like\r\n      increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same\r\n      society, the same competition must produce the same effect in them all.\r\n\r\n      It is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the\r\n      average wages of labour, even in a particular place, and at a particular\r\n      time. We can, even in this case, seldom determine more than what are the\r\n      most usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to the\r\n      profits of stock. Profit is so very fluctuating, that the person who\r\n      carries on a particular trade, cannot always tell you himself what is the\r\n      average of his annual profit. It is affected, not only by every variation\r\n      of price in the commodities which he deals in, but by the good or bad\r\n      fortune both of his rivals and of his customers, and by a thousand other\r\n      accidents, to which goods, when carried either by sea or by land, or even\r\n      when stored in a warehouse, are liable. It varies, therefore, not only\r\n      from year to year, but from day to day, and almost from hour to hour. To\r\n      ascertain what is the average profit of all the different trades carried\r\n      on in a great kingdom, must be much more difficult; and to judge of what\r\n      it may have been formerly, or in remote periods of time, with any degree\r\n      of precision, must be altogether impossible.\r\n\r\n      But though it may be impossible to determine, with any degree of\r\n      precision, what are or were the average profits of stock, either in the\r\n      present or in ancient times, some notion may be formed of them from the\r\n      interest of money. It may be laid down as a maxim, that wherever a great\r\n      deal can be made by the use of money, a great deal will commonly be given\r\n      for the use of it; and that, wherever little can be made by it, less will\r\n      commonly he given for it. Accordingly, therefore, as the usual market rate\r\n      of interest varies in any country, we may be assured that the ordinary\r\n      profits of stock must vary with it, must sink as it sinks, and rise as it\r\n      rises. The progress of interest, therefore, may lead us to form some\r\n      notion of the progress of profit.\r\n\r\n      By the 37th of Henry VIII. all interest above ten per cent. was declared\r\n      unlawful. More, it seems, had sometimes been taken before that. In the\r\n      reign of Edward VI. religious zeal prohibited all interest. This\r\n      prohibition, however, like all others of the same kind, is said to have\r\n      produced no effect, and probably rather increased than diminished the evil\r\n      of usury. The statute of Henry VIII. was revived by the 13th of Elizabeth,\r\n      cap. 8. and ten per cent. continued to be the legal rate of interest till\r\n      the 21st of James I. when it was restricted to eight per cent. It was\r\n      reduced to six per cent. soon after the Restoration, and by the 12th of\r\n      Queen Anne, to five per cent. All these different statutory regulations\r\n      seem to have been made with great propriety. They seem to have followed,\r\n      and not to have gone before, the market rate of interest, or the rate at\r\n      which people of good credit usually borrowed. Since the time of Queen\r\n      Anne, five per cent. seems to have been rather above than below the market\r\n      rate. Before the late war, the government borrowed at three per cent.; and\r\n      people of good credit in the capital, and in many other parts of the\r\n      kingdom, at three and a-half, four, and four and a-half per cent.\r\n\r\n      Since the time of Henry VIII. the wealth and revenue of the country have\r\n      been continually advancing, and in the course of their progress, their\r\n      pace seems rather to have been gradually accelerated than retarded. They\r\n      seem not only to have been going on, but to have been going on faster and\r\n      faster. The wages of labour have been continually increasing during the\r\n      same period, and, in the greater part of the different branches of trade\r\n      and manufactures, the profits of stock have been diminishing.\r\n\r\n      It generally requires a greater stock to carry on any sort of trade in a\r\n      great town than in a country village. The great stocks employed in every\r\n      branch of trade, and the number of rich competitors, generally reduce the\r\n      rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter. But the wages\r\n      of labour are generally higher in a great town than in a country village.\r\n      In a thriving town, the people who have great stocks to employ, frequently\r\n      cannot get the number of workmen they want, and therefore bid against one\r\n      another, in order to get as many as they can, which raises the wages of\r\n      labour, and lowers the profits of stock. In the remote parts of the\r\n      country, there is frequently not stock sufficient to employ all the\r\n      people, who therefore bid against one another, in order to get employment,\r\n      which lowers the wages of labour, and raises the profits of stock.\r\n\r\n      In Scotland, though the legal rate of interest is the same as in England,\r\n      the market rate is rather higher. People of the best credit there seldom\r\n      borrow under five per cent. Even private bankers in Edinburgh give four\r\n      per cent. upon their promissory-notes, of which payment, either in whole\r\n      or in part may be demanded at pleasure. Private bankers in London give no\r\n      interest for the money which is deposited with them. There are few trades\r\n      which cannot be carried on with a smaller stock in Scotland than in\r\n      England. The common rate of profit, therefore, must be somewhat greater.\r\n      The wages of labour, it has already been observed, are lower in Scotland\r\n      than in England. The country, too, is not only much poorer, but the steps\r\n      by which it advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing,\r\n      seem to be much slower and more tardy. The legal rate of interest in\r\n      France has not during the course of the present century, been always\r\n      regulated by the market rate {See Denisart, Article Taux des Interests,\r\n      tom. iii, p.13}. In 1720, interest was reduced from the twentieth to the\r\n      fiftieth penny, or from five to two per cent. In 1724, it was raised to\r\n      the thirtieth penny, or to three and a third per cent. In 1725, it was\r\n      again raised to the twentieth penny, or to five per cent. In 1766, during\r\n      the administration of Mr Laverdy, it was reduced to the twenty-fifth\r\n      penny, or to four per cent. The Abbé Terray raised it afterwards to the\r\n      old rate of five per cent. The supposed purpose of many of those violent\r\n      reductions of interest was to prepare the way for reducing that of the\r\n      public debts; a purpose which has sometimes been executed. France is,\r\n      perhaps, in the present times, not so rich a country as England; and\r\n      though the legal rate of interest has in France frequently been lower than\r\n      in England, the market rate has generally been higher; for there, as in\r\n      other countries, they have several very safe and easy methods of evading\r\n      the law. The profits of trade, I have been assured by British merchants\r\n      who had traded in both countries, are higher in France than in England;\r\n      and it is no doubt upon this account, that many British subjects chuse\r\n      rather to employ their capitals in a country where trade is in disgrace,\r\n      than in one where it is highly respected. The wages of labour are lower in\r\n      France than in England. When you go from Scotland to England, the\r\n      difference which you may remark between the dress and countenance of the\r\n      common people in the one country and in the other, sufficiently indicates\r\n      the difference in their condition. The contrast is still greater when you\r\n      return from France. France, though no doubt a richer country than\r\n      Scotland, seems not to be going forward so fast. It is a common and even a\r\n      popular opinion in the country, that it is going backwards; an opinion\r\n      which I apprehend, is ill-founded, even with regard to France, but which\r\n      nobody can possibly entertain with regard to Scotland, who sees the\r\n      country now, and who saw it twenty or thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n      The province of Holland, on the other hand, in proportion to the extent of\r\n      its territory and the number of its people, is a richer country than\r\n      England. The government there borrow at two per cent. and private people\r\n      of good credit at three. The wages of labour are said to be higher in\r\n      Holland than in England, and the Dutch, it is well known, trade upon lower\r\n      profits than any people in Europe. The trade of Holland, it has been\r\n      pretended by some people, is decaying, and it may perhaps be true that\r\n      some particular branches of it are so; but these symptoms seem to indicate\r\n      sufficiently that there is no general decay. When profit diminishes,\r\n      merchants are very apt to complain that trade decays, though the\r\n      diminution of profit is the natural effect of its prosperity, or of a\r\n      greater stock being employed in it than before. During the late war, the\r\n      Dutch gained the whole carrying trade of France, of which they still\r\n      retain a very large share. The great property which they possess both in\r\n      French and English funds, about forty millions, it is said in the latter\r\n      (in which, I suspect, however, there is a considerable exaggeration ), the\r\n      great sums which they lend to private people, in countries where the rate\r\n      of interest is higher than in their own, are circumstances which no doubt\r\n      demonstrate the redundancy of their stock, or that it has increased beyond\r\n      what they can employ with tolerable profit in the proper business of their\r\n      own country; but they do not demonstrate that that business has decreased.\r\n      As the capital of a private man, though acquired by a particular trade,\r\n      may increase beyond what he can employ in it, and yet that trade continue\r\n      to increase too, so may likewise the capital of a great nation.\r\n\r\n      In our North American and West Indian colonies, not only the wages of\r\n      labour, but the interest of money, and consequently the profits of stock,\r\n      are higher than in England. In the different colonies, both the legal and\r\n      the market rate of interest run from six to eight percent. High wages of\r\n      labour and high profits of stock, however, are things, perhaps, which\r\n      scarce ever go together, except in the peculiar circumstances of new\r\n      colonies. A new colony must always, for some time, be more understocked in\r\n      proportion to the extent of its territory, and more underpeopled in\r\n      proportion to the extent of its stock, than the greater part of other\r\n      countries. They have more land than they have stock to cultivate. What\r\n      they have, therefore, is applied to the cultivation only of what is most\r\n      fertile and most favourably situated, the land near the sea-shore, and\r\n      along the banks of navigable rivers. Such land, too, is frequently\r\n      purchased at a price below the value even of its natural produce. Stock\r\n      employed in the purchase and improvement of such lands, must yield a very\r\n      large profit, and, consequently, afford to pay a very large interest. Its\r\n      rapid accumulation in so profitable an employment enables the planter to\r\n      increase the number of his hands faster than he can find them in a new\r\n      settlement. Those whom he can find, therefore, are very liberally\r\n      rewarded. As the colony increases, the profits of stock gradually\r\n      diminish. When the most fertile and best situated lands have been all\r\n      occupied, less profit can be made by the cultivation of what is inferior\r\n      both in soil and situation, and less interest can be afforded for the\r\n      stock which is so employed. In the greater part of our colonies,\r\n      accordingly, both the legal and the market rate of interest have been\r\n      considerably reduced during the course of the present century. As riches,\r\n      improvement, and population, have increased, interest has declined. The\r\n      wages of labour do not sink with the profits of stock. The demand for\r\n      labour increases with the increase of stock, whatever be its profits; and\r\n      after these are diminished, stock may not only continue to increase, but\r\n      to increase much faster than before. It is with industrious nations, who\r\n      are advancing in the acquisition of riches, as with industrious\r\n      individuals. A great stock, though with small profits, generally increases\r\n      faster than a small stock with great profits. Money, says the proverb,\r\n      makes money. When you have got a little, it is often easy to get more. The\r\n      great difficulty is to get that little. The connection between the\r\n      increase of stock and that of industry, or of the demand for useful\r\n      labour, has partly been explained already, but will be explained more\r\n      fully hereafter, in treating of the accumulation of stock.\r\n\r\n      The acquisition of new territory, or of new branches of trade, may\r\n      sometimes raise the profits of stock, and with them the interest of money,\r\n      even in a country which is fast advancing in the acquisition of riches.\r\n      The stock of the country, not being sufficient for the whole accession of\r\n      business which such acquisitions present to the different people among\r\n      whom it is divided, is applied to those particular branches only which\r\n      afford the greatest profit. Part of what had before been employed in other\r\n      trades, is necessarily withdrawn from them, and turned into some of the\r\n      new and more profitable ones. In all those old trades, therefore, the\r\n      competition comes to be less than before. The market comes to be less\r\n      fully supplied with many different sorts of goods. Their price necessarily\r\n      rises more or less, and yields a greater profit to those who deal in them,\r\n      who can, therefore, afford to borrow at a higher interest. For some time\r\n      after the conclusion of the late war, not only private people of the best\r\n      credit, but some of the greatest companies in London, commonly borrowed at\r\n      five per cent. who, before that, had not been used to pay more than four,\r\n      and four and a half per cent. The great accession both of territory and\r\n      trade by our acquisitions in North America and the West Indies, will\r\n      sufficiently account for this, without supposing any diminution in the\r\n      capital stock of the society. So great an accession of new business to be\r\n      carried on by the old stock, must necessarily have diminished the quantity\r\n      employed in a great number of particular branches, in which the\r\n      competition being less, the profits must have been greater. I shall\r\n      hereafter have occasion to mention the reasons which dispose me to believe\r\n      that the capital stock of Great Britain was not diminished, even by the\r\n      enormous expense of the late war.\r\n\r\n      The diminution of the capital stock of the society, or of the funds\r\n      destined for the maintenance of industry, however, as it lowers the wages\r\n      of labour, so it raises the profits of stock, and consequently the\r\n      interest of money. By the wages of labour being lowered, the owners of\r\n      what stock remains in the society can bring their goods at less expense to\r\n      market than before; and less stock being employed in supplying the market\r\n      than before, they can sell them dearer. Their goods cost them less, and\r\n      they get more for them. Their profits, therefore, being augmented at both\r\n      ends, can well afford a large interest. The great fortunes so suddenly and\r\n      so easily acquired in Bengal and the other British settlements in the East\r\n      Indies, may satisfy us, that as the wages of labour are very low, so the\r\n      profits of stock are very high in those ruined countries. The interest of\r\n      money is proportionably so. In Bengal, money is frequently lent to the\r\n      farmers at forty, fifty, and sixty per cent. and the succeeding crop is\r\n      mortgaged for the payment. As the profits which can afford such an\r\n      interest must eat up almost the whole rent of the landlord, so such\r\n      enormous usury must in its turn eat up the greater part of those profits.\r\n      Before the fall of the Roman republic, a usury of the same kind seems to\r\n      have been common in the provinces, under the ruinous administration of\r\n      their proconsuls. The virtuous Brutus lent money in Cyprus at\r\n      eight-and-forty per cent. as we learn from the letters of Cicero.\r\n\r\n      In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the\r\n      nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other\r\n      countries, allowed it to acquire, which could, therefore, advance no\r\n      further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and\r\n      the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully\r\n      peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain, or its\r\n      stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great\r\n      as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up\r\n      the number of labourers, and the country being already fully peopled, that\r\n      number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion\r\n      to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would\r\n      be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the\r\n      trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as\r\n      great, and, consequently, the ordinary profit as low as possible.\r\n\r\n      But, perhaps, no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\r\n      China seems to have been long stationary, and had, probably, long ago\r\n      acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the\r\n      nature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much\r\n      inferior to what, with other laws and institutions, the nature of its\r\n      soil, climate, and situation, might admit of. A country which neglects or\r\n      despises foreign commerce, and which admits the vessel of foreign nations\r\n      into one or two of its ports only, cannot transact the same quantity of\r\n      business which it might do with different laws and institutions. In a\r\n      country, too, where, though the rich, or the owners of large capitals,\r\n      enjoy a good deal of security, the poor, or the owners of small capitals,\r\n      enjoy scarce any, but are liable, under the pretence of justice, to be\r\n      pillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior mandarins, the quantity\r\n      of stock employed in all the different branches of business transacted\r\n      within it, can never be equal to what the nature and extent of that\r\n      business might admit. In every different branch, the oppression of the\r\n      poor must establish the monopoly of the rich, who, by engrossing the whole\r\n      trade to themselves, will be able to make very large profits. Twelve per\r\n      cent. accordingly, is said to be the common interest of money in China,\r\n      and the ordinary profits of stock must be sufficient to afford this large\r\n      interest.\r\n\r\n      A defect in the law may sometimes raise the rate of interest considerably\r\n      above what the condition of the country, as to wealth or poverty, would\r\n      require. When the law does not enforce the performance of contracts, it\r\n      puts all borrowers nearly upon the same footing with bankrupts, or people\r\n      of doubtful credit, in better regulated countries. The uncertainty of\r\n      recovering his money makes the lender exact the same usurious interest\r\n      which is usually required from bankrupts. Among the barbarous nations who\r\n      overran the western provinces of the Roman empire, the performance of\r\n      contracts was left for many ages to the faith of the contracting parties.\r\n      The courts of justice of their kings seldom intermeddled in it. The high\r\n      rate of interest which took place in those ancient times, may, perhaps, be\r\n      partly accounted for from this cause.\r\n\r\n      When the law prohibits interest altogether, it does not prevent it. Many\r\n      people must borrow, and nobody will lend without such a consideration for\r\n      the use of their money as is suitable, not only to what can be made by the\r\n      use of it, but to the difficulty and danger of evading the law. The high\r\n      rate of interest among all Mahometan nations is accounted for by M.\r\n      Montesquieu, not from their poverty, but partly from this, and partly from\r\n      the difficulty of recovering the money.\r\n\r\n      The lowest ordinary rate of profit must always be something more than what\r\n      is sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to which every\r\n      employment of stock is exposed. It is this surplus only which is neat or\r\n      clear profit. What is called gross profit, comprehends frequently not only\r\n      this surplus, but what is retained for compensating such extraordinary\r\n      losses. The interest which the borrower can afford to pay is in proportion\r\n      to the clear profit only. The lowest ordinary rate of interest must, in\r\n      the same manner, be something more than sufficient to compensate the\r\n      occasional losses to which lending, even with tolerable prudence, is\r\n      exposed. Were it not, mere charity or friendship could be the only motives\r\n      for lending.\r\n\r\n      In a country which had acquired its full complement of riches, where, in\r\n      every particular branch of business, there was the greatest quantity of\r\n      stock that could be employed in it, as the ordinary rate of clear profit\r\n      would be very small, so the usual market rate of interest which could be\r\n      afforded out of it would be so low as to render it impossible for any but\r\n      the very wealthiest people to live upon the interest of their money. All\r\n      people of small or middling fortunes would be obliged to superintend\r\n      themselves the employment of their own stocks. It would be necessary that\r\n      almost every man should be a man of business, or engage in some sort of\r\n      trade. The province of Holland seems to be approaching near to this state.\r\n      It is there unfashionable not to be a man of business. Necessity makes it\r\n      usual for almost every man to be so, and custom everywhere regulates\r\n      fashion. As it is ridiculous not to dress, so is it, in some measure, not\r\n      to be employed like other people. As a man of a civil profession seems\r\n      awkward in a camp or a garrison, and is even in some danger of being\r\n      despised there, so does an idle man among men of business.\r\n\r\n      The highest ordinary rate of profit may be such as, in the price of the\r\n      greater part of commodities, eats up the whole of what should go to the\r\n      rent of the land, and leaves only what is sufficient to pay the labour of\r\n      preparing and bringing them to market, according to the lowest rate at\r\n      which labour can anywhere be paid, the bare subsistence of the labourer.\r\n      The workman must always have been fed in some way or other while he was\r\n      about the work, but the landlord may not always have been paid. The\r\n      profits of the trade which the servants of the East India Company carry on\r\n      in Bengal may not, perhaps, be very far from this rate.\r\n\r\n      The proportion which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to\r\n      the ordinary rate of clear profit, necessarily varies as profit rises or\r\n      falls. Double interest is in Great Britain reckoned what the merchants\r\n      call a good, moderate, reasonable profit; terms which, I apprehend, mean\r\n      no more than a common and usual profit. In a country where the ordinary\r\n      rate of clear profit is eight or ten per cent. it may be reasonable that\r\n      one half of it should go to interest, wherever business is carried on with\r\n      borrowed money. The stock is at the risk of the borrower, who, as it were,\r\n      insures it to the lender; and four or five per cent. may, in the greater\r\n      part of trades, be both a sufficient profit upon the risk of this\r\n      insurance, and a sufficient recompence for the trouble of employing the\r\n      stock. But the proportion between interest and clear profit might not be\r\n      the same in countries where the ordinary rate of profit was either a good\r\n      deal lower, or a good deal higher. If it were a good deal lower, one half\r\n      of it, perhaps, could not be afforded for interest; and more might be\r\n      afforded if it were a good deal higher.\r\n\r\n      In countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit\r\n      may, in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of\r\n      labour, and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving\r\n      neighbours, among whom the wages of labour may be lower.\r\n\r\n      In reality, high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than\r\n      high wages. If, in the linen manufacture, for example, the wages of the\r\n      different working people, the flax-dressers, the spinners, the weavers,\r\n      etc. should all of them be advanced twopence a-day, it would be necessary\r\n      to heighten the price of a piece of linen only by a number of twopences\r\n      equal to the number of people that had been employed about it, multiplied\r\n      by the number of days during which they had been so employed. That part of\r\n      the price of the commodity which resolved itself into the wages, would,\r\n      through all the different stages of the manufacture, rise only in\r\n      arithmetical proportion to this rise of wages. But if the profits of all\r\n      the different employers of those working people should be raised five per\r\n      cent. that part of the price of the commodity which resolved itself into\r\n      profit would, through all the different stages of the manufacture, rise in\r\n      geometrical proportion to this rise of profit. The employer of the flax\r\n      dressers would, in selling his flax, require an additional five per cent.\r\n      upon the whole value of the materials and wages which he advanced to his\r\n      workmen. The employer of the spinners would require an additional five per\r\n      cent. both upon the advanced price of the flax, and upon the wages of the\r\n      spinners. And the employer of the weavers would require alike five per\r\n      cent. both upon the advanced price of the linen-yarn, and upon the wages\r\n      of the weavers. In raising the price of commodities, the rise of wages\r\n      operates in the same manner as simple interest does in the accumulation of\r\n      debt. The rise of profit operates like compound interest. Our merchants\r\n      and master manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in\r\n      raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods, both at\r\n      home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high\r\n      profits; they are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their\r\n      own gains; they complain only of those of other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nOF WAGES AND PROFIT IN THE DIFFERENT\r\nEMPLOYMENTS OF LABOUR AND STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments\r\n      of labour and stock, must, in the same neighbourhood, be either perfectly\r\n      equal, or continually tending to equality. If, in the same neighbourhood,\r\n      there was any employment evidently either more or less advantageous than\r\n      the rest, so many people would crowd into it in the one case, and so many\r\n      would desert it in the other, that its advantages would soon return to the\r\n      level of other employments. This, at least, would be the case in a society\r\n      where things were left to follow their natural course, where there was\r\n      perfect liberty, and where every man was perfectly free both to choose\r\n      what occupation he thought proper, and to change it as often as he thought\r\n      proper. Every man’s interest would prompt him to seek the advantageous,\r\n      and to shun the disadvantageous employment.\r\n\r\n      Pecuniary wages and profit, indeed, are everywhere in Europe extremely\r\n      different, according to the different employments of labour and stock. But\r\n      this difference arises, partly from certain circumstances in the\r\n      employments themselves, which, either really, or at least in the\r\n      imagination of men, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and\r\n      counterbalance a great one in others, and partly from the policy of\r\n      Europe, which nowhere leaves things at perfect liberty.\r\n\r\n      The particular consideration of those circumstances, and of that policy,\r\n      will divide this Chapter into two parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART I. Inequalities arising from the nature of the employments\r\n      themselves.\r\n\r\n      The five following are the principal circumstances which, so far as I have\r\n      been able to observe, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some\r\n      employments, and counterbalance a great one in others. First, the\r\n      agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves; secondly,\r\n      the easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning\r\n      them; thirdly, the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them;\r\n      fourthly, the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who\r\n      exercise them; and, fifthly, the probability or improbability of success\r\n      in them.\r\n\r\n      First, the wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness\r\n      or dirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness, of the employment.\r\n      Thus in most places, take the year round, a journeyman tailor earns less\r\n      than a journeyman weaver. His work is much easier. A journeyman weaver\r\n      earns less than a journeyman smith. His work is not always easier, but it\r\n      is much cleanlier. A journeyman blacksmith, though an artificer, seldom\r\n      earns so much in twelve hours, as a collier, who is only a labourer, does\r\n      in eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less dangerous, and is\r\n      carried on in day-light, and above ground. Honour makes a great part of\r\n      the reward of all honourable professions. In point of pecuniary gain, all\r\n      things considered, they are generally under-recompensed, as I shall\r\n      endeavour to shew by and by. Disgrace has the contrary effect. The trade\r\n      of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business; but it is in most places\r\n      more profitable than the greater part of common trades. The most\r\n      detestable of all employments, that of public executioner, is, in\r\n      proportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any common trade\r\n      whatever.\r\n\r\n      Hunting and fishing, the most important employments of mankind in the rude\r\n      state of society, become, in its advanced state, their most agreeable\r\n      amusements, and they pursue for pleasure what they once followed from\r\n      necessity. In the advanced state of society, therefore, they are all very\r\n      poor people who follow as a trade, what other people pursue as a pastime.\r\n      Fishermen have been so since the time of Theocritus. {See Idyllium xxi.}.\r\n      A poacher is everywhere a very poor man in Great Britain. In countries\r\n      where the rigour of the law suffers no poachers, the licensed hunter is\r\n      not in a much better condition. The natural taste for those employments\r\n      makes more people follow them, than can live comfortably by them; and the\r\n      produce of their labour, in proportion to its quantity, comes always too\r\n      cheap to market, to afford any thing but the most scanty subsistence to\r\n      the labourers.\r\n\r\n      Disagreeableness and disgrace affect the profits of stock in the same\r\n      manner as the wages of labour. The keeper of an inn or tavern, who is\r\n      never master of his own house, and who is exposed to the brutality of\r\n      every drunkard, exercises neither a very agreeable nor a very creditable\r\n      business. But there is scarce any common trade in which a small stock\r\n      yields so great a profit.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, the wages of labour vary with the easiness and cheapness, or the\r\n      difficulty and expense, of learning the business.\r\n\r\n      When any expensive machine is erected, the extraordinary work to be\r\n      performed by it before it is worn out, it must be expected, will replace\r\n      the capital laid out upon it, with at least the ordinary profits. A man\r\n      educated at the expense of much labour and time to any of those\r\n      employments which require extraordinary dexterity and skill, may be\r\n      compared to one of those expensive machines. The work which he learns to\r\n      perform, it must be expected, over and above the usual wages of common\r\n      labour, will replace to him the whole expense of his education, with at\r\n      least the ordinary profits of an equally valuable capital. It must do this\r\n      too in a reasonable time, regard being had to the very uncertain duration\r\n      of human life, in the same manner as to the more certain duration of the\r\n      machine.\r\n\r\n      The difference between the wages of skilled labour and those of common\r\n      labour, is founded upon this principle.\r\n\r\n      The policy of Europe considers the labour of all mechanics, artificers,\r\n      and manufacturers, as skilled labour; and that of all country labourers as\r\n      common labour. It seems to suppose that of the former to be of a more nice\r\n      and delicate nature than that of the latter. It is so perhaps in some\r\n      cases; but in the greater part it is quite otherwise, as I shall endeavour\r\n      to shew by and by. The laws and customs of Europe, therefore, in order to\r\n      qualify any person for exercising the one species of labour, impose the\r\n      necessity of an apprenticeship, though with different degrees of rigour in\r\n      different places. They leave the other free and open to every body. During\r\n      the continuance of the apprenticeship, the whole labour of the apprentice\r\n      belongs to his master. In the meantime he must, in many cases, be\r\n      maintained by his parents or relations, and, in almost all cases, must be\r\n      clothed by them. Some money, too, is commonly given to the master for\r\n      teaching him his trade. They who cannot give money, give time, or become\r\n      bound for more than the usual number of years; a consideration which,\r\n      though it is not always advantageous to the master, on account of the\r\n      usual idleness of apprentices, is always disadvantageous to the\r\n      apprentice. In country labour, on the contrary, the labourer, while he is\r\n      employed about the easier, learns the more difficult parts of his\r\n      business, and his own labour maintains him through all the different\r\n      stages of his employment. It is reasonable, therefore, that in Europe the\r\n      wages of mechanics, artificers, and manufacturers, should be somewhat\r\n      higher than those of common labourers. They are so accordingly, and their\r\n      superior gains make them, in most places, be considered as a superior rank\r\n      of people. This superiority, however, is generally very small: the daily\r\n      or weekly earnings of journeymen in the more common sorts of manufactures,\r\n      such as those of plain linen and woollen cloth, computed at an average,\r\n      are, in most places, very little more than the day-wages of common\r\n      labourers. Their employment, indeed, is more steady and uniform, and the\r\n      superiority of their earnings, taking the whole year together, may be\r\n      somewhat greater. It seems evidently, however, to be no greater than what\r\n      is sufficient to compensate the superior expense of their education.\r\n      Education in the ingenious arts, and in the liberal professions, is still\r\n      more tedious and expensive. The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of\r\n      painters and sculptors, of lawyers and physicians, ought to be much more\r\n      liberal; and it is so accordingly.\r\n\r\n      The profits of stock seem to be very little affected by the easiness or\r\n      difficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed. All the\r\n      different ways in which stock is commonly employed in great towns seem, in\r\n      reality, to be almost equally easy and equally difficult to learn. One\r\n      branch, either of foreign or domestic trade, cannot well be a much more\r\n      intricate business than another.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, the wages of labour in different occupations vary with the\r\n      constancy or inconstancy of employment.\r\n\r\n      Employment is much more constant in some trades than in others. In the\r\n      greater part of manufactures, a journeyman maybe pretty sure of employment\r\n      almost every day in the year that he is able to work. A mason or\r\n      bricklayer, on the contrary, can work neither in hard frost nor in foul\r\n      weather, and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional\r\n      calls of his customers. He is liable, in consequence, to be frequently\r\n      without any. What he earns, therefore, while he is employed, must not only\r\n      maintain him while he is idle, but make him some compensation for those\r\n      anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a\r\n      situation must sometimes occasion. Where the computed earnings of the\r\n      greater part of manufacturers, accordingly, are nearly upon a level with\r\n      the day-wages of common labourers, those of masons and bricklayers are\r\n      generally from one-half more to double those wages. Where common labourers\r\n      earn four or five shillings a-week, masons and bricklayers frequently earn\r\n      seven and eight; where the former earn six, the latter often earn nine and\r\n      ten; and where the former earn nine and ten, as in London, the latter\r\n      commonly earn fifteen and eighteen. No species of skilled labour, however,\r\n      seems more easy to learn than that of masons and bricklayers. Chairmen in\r\n      London, during the summer season, are said sometimes to be employed as\r\n      bricklayers. The high wages of those workmen, therefore, are not so much\r\n      the recompence of their skill, as the compensation for the inconstancy of\r\n      their employment.\r\n\r\n      A house-carpenter seems to exercise rather a nicer and a more ingenious\r\n      trade than a mason. In most places, however, for it is not universally so,\r\n      his day-wages are somewhat lower. His employment, though it depends much,\r\n      does not depend so entirely upon the occasional calls of his customers;\r\n      and it is not liable to be interrupted by the weather.\r\n\r\n      When the trades which generally afford constant employment, happen in a\r\n      particular place not to do so, the wages of the workmen always rise a good\r\n      deal above their ordinary proportion to those of common labour. In London,\r\n      almost all journeymen artificers are liable to be called upon and\r\n      dismissed by their masters from day to day, and from week to week, in the\r\n      same manner as day-labourers in other places. The lowest order of\r\n      artificers, journeymen tailors, accordingly, earn their half-a-crown\r\n      a-day, though eighteen pence may be reckoned the wages of common labour.\r\n      In small towns and country villages, the wages of journeymen tailors\r\n      frequently scarce equal those of common labour; but in London they are\r\n      often many weeks without employment, particularly during the summer.\r\n\r\n      When the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship,\r\n      disagreeableness, and dirtiness of the work, it sometimes raises the wages\r\n      of the most common labour above those of the most skilful artificers. A\r\n      collier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly\r\n      about double, and, in many parts of Scotland, about three times, the wages\r\n      of common labour. His high wages arise altogether from the hardship,\r\n      disagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work. His employment may, upon most\r\n      occasions, be as constant as he pleases. The coal-heavers in London\r\n      exercise a trade which, in hardship, dirtiness, and disagreeableness,\r\n      almost equals that of colliers; and, from the unavoidable irregularity in\r\n      the arrivals of coal-ships, the employment of the greater part of them is\r\n      necessarily very inconstant. If colliers, therefore, commonly earn double\r\n      and triple the wages of common labour, it ought not to seem unreasonable\r\n      that coal-heavers should sometimes earn four and five times those wages.\r\n      In the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago, it was found\r\n      that, at the rate at which they were then paid, they could earn from six\r\n      to ten shillings a-day. Six shillings are about four times the wages of\r\n      common labour in London; and, in every particular trade, the lowest common\r\n      earnings may always be considered as those of the far greater number. How\r\n      extravagant soever those earnings may appear, if they were more than\r\n      sufficient to compensate all the disagreeable circumstances of the\r\n      business, there would soon be so great a number of competitors, as, in a\r\n      trade which has no exclusive privilege, would quickly reduce them to a\r\n      lower rate.\r\n\r\n      The constancy or inconstancy of employment cannot affect the ordinary\r\n      profits of stock in any particular trade. Whether the stock is or is not\r\n      constantly employed, depends, not upon the trade, but the trader.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, the wages of labour vary according to the small or great trust\r\n      which must be reposed in the workmen.\r\n\r\n      The wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are everywhere superior to those of\r\n      many other workmen, not only of equal, but of much superior ingenuity, on\r\n      account of the precious materials with which they are entrusted. We trust\r\n      our health to the physician, our fortune, and sometimes our life and\r\n      reputation, to the lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely\r\n      be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward must be\r\n      such, therefore, as may give them that rank in the society which so\r\n      important a trust requires. The long time and the great expense which must\r\n      be laid out in their education, when combined with this circumstance,\r\n      necessarily enhance still further the price of their labour.\r\n\r\n      When a person employs only his own stock in trade, there is no trust; and\r\n      the credit which he may get from other people, depends, not upon the\r\n      nature of the trade, but upon their opinion of his fortune, probity and\r\n      prudence. The different rates of profit, therefore, in the different\r\n      branches of trade, cannot arise from the different degrees of trust\r\n      reposed in the traders.\r\n\r\n      Fifthly, the wages of labour in different employments vary according to\r\n      the probability or improbability of success in them.\r\n\r\n      The probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the\r\n      employments to which he is educated, is very different in different\r\n      occupations. In the greatest part of mechanic trades success is almost\r\n      certain; but very uncertain in the liberal professions. Put your son\r\n      apprentice to a shoemaker, there is little doubt of his learning to make a\r\n      pair of shoes; but send him to study the law, it as at least twenty to one\r\n      if he ever makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the\r\n      business. In a perfectly fair lottery, those who draw the prizes ought to\r\n      gain all that is lost by those who draw the blanks. In a profession, where\r\n      twenty fail for one that succeeds, that one ought to gain all that should\r\n      have been gained by the unsuccessful twenty. The counsellor at law, who,\r\n      perhaps, at near forty years of age, begins to make something by his\r\n      profession, ought to receive the retribution, not only of his own so\r\n      tedious and expensive education, but of that of more than twenty others,\r\n      who are never likely to make any thing by it. How extravagant soever the\r\n      fees of counsellors at law may sometimes appear, their real retribution is\r\n      never equal to this. Compute, in any particular place, what is likely to\r\n      be annually gained, and what is likely to be annually spent, by all the\r\n      different workmen in any common trade, such as that of shoemakers or\r\n      weavers, and you will find that the former sum will generally exceed the\r\n      latter. But make the same computation with regard to all the counsellors\r\n      and students of law, in all the different Inns of Court, and you will find\r\n      that their annual gains bear but a very small proportion to their annual\r\n      expense, even though you rate the former as high, and the latter as low,\r\n      as can well be done. The lottery of the law, therefore, is very far from\r\n      being a perfectly fair lottery; and that as well as many other liberal and\r\n      honourable professions, is, in point of pecuniary gain, evidently\r\n      under-recompensed.\r\n\r\n      Those professions keep their level, however, with other occupations; and,\r\n      notwithstanding these discouragements, all the most generous and liberal\r\n      spirits are eager to crowd into them. Two different causes contribute to\r\n      recommend them. First, the desire of the reputation which attends upon\r\n      superior excellence in any of them; and, secondly, the natural confidence\r\n      which every man has, more or less, not only in his own abilities, but in\r\n      his own good fortune.\r\n\r\n      To excel in any profession, in which but few arrive at mediocrity, is the\r\n      most decisive mark of what is called genius, or superior talents. The\r\n      public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities makes\r\n      always a part of their reward; a greater or smaller, in proportion as it\r\n      is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward\r\n      in the profession of physic; a still greater, perhaps, in that of law; in\r\n      poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\r\n\r\n      There are some very agreeable and beautiful talents, of which the\r\n      possession commands a certain sort of admiration, but of which the\r\n      exercise, for the sake of gain, is considered, whether from reason or\r\n      prejudice, as a sort of public prostitution. The pecuniary recompence,\r\n      therefore, of those who exercise them in this manner, must be sufficient,\r\n      not only to pay for the time, labour, and expense of acquiring the\r\n      talents, but for the discredit which attends the employment of them as the\r\n      means of subsistence. The exorbitant rewards of players, opera-singers,\r\n      opera-dancers, etc. are founded upon those two principles; the rarity and\r\n      beauty of the talents, and the discredit of employing them in this manner.\r\n      It seems absurd at first sight, that we should despise their persons, and\r\n      yet reward their talents with the most profuse liberality. While we do the\r\n      one, however, we must of necessity do the other, Should the public opinion\r\n      or prejudice ever alter with regard to such occupations, their pecuniary\r\n      recompence would quickly diminish. More people would apply to them, and\r\n      the competition would quickly reduce the price of their labour. Such\r\n      talents, though far from being common, are by no means so rare as\r\n      imagined. Many people possess them in great perfection, who disdain to\r\n      make this use of them; and many more are capable of acquiring them, if any\r\n      thing could be made honourably by them.\r\n\r\n      The over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own\r\n      abilities, is an ancient evil remarked by the philosophers and moralists\r\n      of all ages. Their absurd presumption in their own good fortune has been\r\n      less taken notice of. It is, however, if possible, still more universal.\r\n      There is no man living, who, when in tolerable health and spirits, has not\r\n      some share of it. The chance of gain is by every man more or less\r\n      over-valued, and the chance of loss is by most men under-valued, and by\r\n      scarce any man, who is in tolerable health and spirits, valued more than\r\n      it is worth.\r\n\r\n      That the chance of gain is naturally overvalued, we may learn from the\r\n      universal success of lotteries. The world neither ever saw, nor ever will\r\n      see, a perfectly fair lottery, or one in which the whole gain compensated\r\n      the whole loss; because the undertaker could make nothing by it. In the\r\n      state lotteries, the tickets are really not worth the price which is paid\r\n      by the original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the market for\r\n      twenty, thirty, and sometimes forty per cent. advance. The vain hopes of\r\n      gaining some of the great prizes is the sole cause of this demand. The\r\n      soberest people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a small sum for the\r\n      chance of gaining ten or twenty thousand pounds, though they know that\r\n      even that small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty per cent. more than the\r\n      chance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds,\r\n      though in other respects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one\r\n      than the common state lotteries, there would not be the same demand for\r\n      tickets. In order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes,\r\n      some people purchase several tickets; and others, small shares in a still\r\n      greater number. There is not, however, a more certain proposition in\r\n      mathematics, than that the more tickets you adventure upon, the more\r\n      likely you are to be a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the\r\n      lottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater the number of your\r\n      tickets, the nearer you approach to this certainty.\r\n\r\n      That the chance of loss is frequently undervalued, and scarce ever valued\r\n      more than it is worth, we may learn from the very moderate profit of\r\n      insurers. In order to make insurance, either from fire or sea-risk, a\r\n      trade at all, the common premium must be sufficient to compensate the\r\n      common losses, to pay the expense of management, and to afford such a\r\n      profit as might have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any\r\n      common trade. The person who pays no more than this, evidently pays no\r\n      more than the real value of the risk, or the lowest price at which he can\r\n      reasonably expect to insure it. But though many people have made a little\r\n      money by insurance, very few have made a great fortune; and, from this\r\n      consideration alone, it seems evident enough that the ordinary balance of\r\n      profit and loss is not more advantageous in this than in other common\r\n      trades, by which so many people make fortunes. Moderate, however, as the\r\n      premium of insurance commonly is, many people despise the risk too much to\r\n      care to pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, nineteen houses in\r\n      twenty, or rather, perhaps, ninety-nine in a hundred, are not insured from\r\n      fire. Sea-risk is more alarming to the greater part of people; and the\r\n      proportion of ships insured to those not insured is much greater. Many\r\n      sail, however, at all seasons, and even in time of war, without any\r\n      insurance. This may sometimes, perhaps, be done without any imprudence.\r\n      When a great company, or even a great merchant, has twenty or thirty ships\r\n      at sea, they may, as it were, insure one another. The premium saved up on\r\n      them all may more than compensate such losses as they are likely to meet\r\n      with in the common course of chances. The neglect of insurance upon\r\n      shipping, however, in the same manner as upon houses, is, in most cases,\r\n      the effect of no such nice calculation, but of mere thoughtless rashness,\r\n      and presumptuous contempt of the risk.\r\n\r\n      The contempt of risk, and the presumptuous hope of success, are in no\r\n      period of life more active than at the age at which young people choose\r\n      their professions. How little the fear of misfortune is then capable of\r\n      balancing the hope of good luck, appears still more evidently in the\r\n      readiness of the common people to enlist as soldiers, or to go to sea,\r\n      than in the eagerness of those of better fashion to enter into what are\r\n      called the liberal professions.\r\n\r\n      What a common soldier may lose is obvious enough. Without regarding the\r\n      danger, however, young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the\r\n      beginning of a new war; and though they have scarce any chance of\r\n      preferment, they figure to themselves, in their youthful fancies, a\r\n      thousand occasions of acquiring honour and distinction which never occur.\r\n      These romantic hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their pay is\r\n      less than that of common labourers, and, in actual service, their fatigues\r\n      are much greater.\r\n\r\n      The lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that of the\r\n      army. The son of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go to\r\n      sea with his father’s consent; but if he enlists as a soldier, it is\r\n      always without it. Other people see some chance of his making something by\r\n      the one trade; nobody but himself sees any of his making any thing by the\r\n      other. The great admiral is less the object of public admiration than the\r\n      great general; and the highest success in the sea service promises a less\r\n      brilliant fortune and reputation than equal success in the land. The same\r\n      difference runs through all the inferior degrees of preferment in both. By\r\n      the rules of precedency, a captain in the navy ranks with a colonel in the\r\n      army; but he does not rank with him in the common estimation. As the great\r\n      prizes in the lottery are less, the smaller ones must be more numerous.\r\n      Common sailors, therefore, more frequently get some fortune and preferment\r\n      than common soldiers; and the hope of those prizes is what principally\r\n      recommends the trade. Though their skill and dexterity are much superior\r\n      to that of almost any artificers; and though their whole life is one\r\n      continual scene of hardship and danger; yet for all this dexterity and\r\n      skill, for all those hardships and dangers, while they remain in the\r\n      condition of common sailors, they receive scarce any other recompence but\r\n      the pleasure of exercising the one and of surmounting the other. Their\r\n      wages are not greater than those of common labourers at the port which\r\n      regulates the rate of seamen’s wages. As they are continually going from\r\n      port to port, the monthly pay of those who sail from all the different\r\n      ports of Great Britain, is more nearly upon a level than that of any other\r\n      workmen in those different places; and the rate of the port to and from\r\n      which the greatest number sail, that is, the port of London, regulates\r\n      that of all the rest. At London, the wages of the greater part of the\r\n      different classes of workmen are about double those of the same classes at\r\n      Edinburgh. But the sailors who sail from the port of London, seldom earn\r\n      above three or four shillings a month more than those who sail from the\r\n      port of Leith, and the difference is frequently not so great. In time of\r\n      peace, and in the merchant-service, the London price is from a guinea to\r\n      about seven-and-twenty shillings the calendar month. A common labourer in\r\n      London, at the rate of nine or ten shillings a week, may earn in the\r\n      calendar month from forty to five-and-forty shillings. The sailor, indeed,\r\n      over and above his pay, is supplied with provisions. Their value, however,\r\n      may not perhaps always exceed the difference between his pay and that of\r\n      the common labourer; and though it sometimes should, the excess will not\r\n      be clear gain to the sailor, because he cannot share it with his wife and\r\n      family, whom he must maintain out of his wages at home.\r\n\r\n      The dangers and hair-breadth escapes of a life of adventures, instead of\r\n      disheartening young people, seem frequently to recommend a trade to them.\r\n      A tender mother, among the inferior ranks of people, is often afraid to\r\n      send her son to school at a sea-port town, lest the sight of the ships,\r\n      and the conversation and adventures of the sailors, should entice him to\r\n      go to sea. The distant prospect of hazards, from which we can hope to\r\n      extricate ourselves by courage and address, is not disagreeable to us, and\r\n      does not raise the wages of labour in any employment. It is otherwise with\r\n      those in which courage and address can be of no avail. In trades which are\r\n      known to be very unwholesome, the wages of labour are always remarkably\r\n      high. Unwholesomeness is a species of disagreeableness, and its effects\r\n      upon the wages of labour are to be ranked under that general head.\r\n\r\n      In all the different employments of stock, the ordinary rate of profit\r\n      varies more or less with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns.\r\n      These are, in general, less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign\r\n      trade, and in some branches of foreign trade than in others; in the trade\r\n      to North America, for example, than in that to Jamaica. The ordinary rate\r\n      of profit always rises more or less with the risk. It does not, however,\r\n      seem to rise in proportion to it, or so as to compensate it completely.\r\n      Bankruptcies are most frequent in the most hazardous trades. The most\r\n      hazardous of all trades, that of a smuggler, though, when the adventure\r\n      succeeds, it is likewise the most profitable, is the infallible road to\r\n      bankruptcy. The presumptuous hope of success seems to act here as upon all\r\n      other occasions, and to entice so many adventurers into those hazardous\r\n      trades, that their competition reduces the profit below what is sufficient\r\n      to compensate the risk. To compensate it completely, the common returns\r\n      ought, over and above the ordinary profits of stock, not only to make up\r\n      for all occasional losses, but to afford a surplus profit to the\r\n      adventurers, of the same nature with the profit of insurers. But if the\r\n      common returns were sufficient for all this, bankruptcies would not be\r\n      more frequent in these than in other trades.\r\n\r\n      Of the five circumstances, therefore, which vary the wages of labour, two\r\n      only affect the profits of stock; the agreeableness or disagreeableness of\r\n      the business, and the risk or security with which it is attended. In point\r\n      of agreeableness or disagreeableness, there is little or no difference in\r\n      the far greater part of the different employments of stock, but a great\r\n      deal in those of labour; and the ordinary profit of stock, though it rises\r\n      with the risk, does not always seem to rise in proportion to it. It should\r\n      follow from all this, that, in the same society or neighbourhood, the\r\n      average and ordinary rates of profit in the different employments of stock\r\n      should be more nearly upon a level than the pecuniary wages of the\r\n      different sorts of labour.\r\n\r\n      They are so accordingly. The difference between the earnings of a common\r\n      labourer and those of a well employed lawyer or physician, is evidently\r\n      much greater than that between the ordinary profits in any two different\r\n      branches of trade. The apparent difference, besides, in the profits of\r\n      different trades, is generally a deception arising from our not always\r\n      distinguishing what ought to be considered as wages, from what ought to be\r\n      considered as profit.\r\n\r\n      Apothecaries’ profit is become a bye-word, denoting something uncommonly\r\n      extravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no more\r\n      than the reasonable wages of labour. The skill of an apothecary is a much\r\n      nicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever; and\r\n      the trust which is reposed in him is of much greater importance. He is the\r\n      physician of the poor in all cases, and of the rich when the distress or\r\n      danger is not very great. His reward, therefore, ought to be suitable to\r\n      his skill and his trust; and it arises generally from the price at which\r\n      he sells his drugs. But the whole drugs which the best employed apothecary\r\n      in a large market-town, will sell in a year, may not perhaps cost him\r\n      above thirty or forty pounds. Though he should sell them, therefore, for\r\n      three or four hundred, or at a thousand per cent. profit, this may\r\n      frequently be no more than the reasonable wages of his labour, charged, in\r\n      the only way in which he can charge them, upon the price of his drugs. The\r\n      greater part of the apparent profit is real wages disguised in the garb of\r\n      profit.\r\n\r\n      In a small sea-port town, a little grocer will make forty or fifty per\r\n      cent. upon a stock of a single hundred pounds, while a considerable\r\n      wholesale merchant in the same place will scarce make eight or ten per\r\n      cent. upon a stock of ten thousand. The trade of the grocer may be\r\n      necessary for the conveniency of the inhabitants, and the narrowness of\r\n      the market may not admit the employment of a larger capital in the\r\n      business. The man, however, must not only live by his trade, but live by\r\n      it suitably to the qualifications which it requires. Besides possessing a\r\n      little capital, he must be able to read, write, and account and must be a\r\n      tolerable judge, too, of perhaps fifty or sixty different sorts of goods,\r\n      their prices, qualities, and the markets where they are to be had\r\n      cheapest. He must have all the knowledge, in short, that is necessary for\r\n      a great merchant, which nothing hinders him from becoming but the want of\r\n      a sufficient capital. Thirty or forty pounds a year cannot be considered\r\n      as too great a recompence for the labour of a person so accomplished.\r\n      Deduct this from the seemingly great profits of his capital, and little\r\n      more will remain, perhaps, than the ordinary profits of stock. The greater\r\n      part of the apparent profit is, in this case too, real wages.\r\n\r\n      The difference between the apparent profit of the retail and that of the\r\n      wholesale trade, is much less in the capital than in small towns and\r\n      country villages. Where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the grocery\r\n      trade, the wages of the grocer’s labour must be a very trifling addition\r\n      to the real profits of so great a stock. The apparent profits of the\r\n      wealthy retailer, therefore, are there more nearly upon a level with those\r\n      of the wholesale merchant. It is upon this account that goods sold by\r\n      retail are generally as cheap, and frequently much cheaper, in the capital\r\n      than in small towns and country villages. Grocery goods, for example, are\r\n      generally much cheaper; bread and butchers’ meat frequently as cheap. It\r\n      costs no more to bring grocery goods to the great town than to the country\r\n      village; but it costs a great deal more to bring corn and cattle, as the\r\n      greater part of them must be brought from a much greater distance. The\r\n      prime cost of grocery goods, therefore, being the same in both places,\r\n      they are cheapest where the least profit is charged upon them. The prime\r\n      cost of bread and butchers’ meat is greater in the great town than in the\r\n      country village; and though the profit is less, therefore they are not\r\n      always cheaper there, but often equally cheap. In such articles as bread\r\n      and butchers’ meat, the same cause which diminishes apparent profit,\r\n      increases prime cost. The extent of the market, by giving employment to\r\n      greater stocks, diminishes apparent profit; but by requiring supplies from\r\n      a greater distance, it increases prime cost. This diminution of the one\r\n      and increase of the other, seem, in most cases, nearly to counterbalance\r\n      one another; which is probably the reason that, though the prices of corn\r\n      and cattle are commonly very different in different parts of the kingdom,\r\n      those of bread and butchers’ meat are generally very nearly the same\r\n      through the greater part of it.\r\n\r\n      Though the profits of stock, both in the wholesale and retail trade, are\r\n      generally less in the capital than in small towns and country villages,\r\n      yet great fortunes are frequently acquired from small beginnings in the\r\n      former, and scarce ever in the latter. In small towns and country\r\n      villages, on account of the narrowness of the market, trade cannot always\r\n      be extended as stock extends. In such places, therefore, though the rate\r\n      of a particular person’s profits may be very high, the sum or amount of\r\n      them can never be very great, nor consequently that of his annual\r\n      accumulation. In great towns, on the contrary, trade can be extended as\r\n      stock increases, and the credit of a frugal and thriving man increases\r\n      much faster than his stock. His trade is extended in proportion to the\r\n      amount of both; and the sum or amount of his profits is in proportion to\r\n      the extent of his trade, and his annual accumulation in proportion to the\r\n      amount of his profits. It seldom happens, however, that great fortunes are\r\n      made, even in great towns, by any one regular, established, and well-known\r\n      branch of business, but in consequence of a long life of industry,\r\n      frugality, and attention. Sudden fortunes, indeed, are sometimes made in\r\n      such places, by what is called the trade of speculation. The speculative\r\n      merchant exercises no one regular, established, or well-known branch of\r\n      business. He is a corn merchant this year, and a wine merchant the next,\r\n      and a sugar, tobacco, or tea merchant the year after. He enters into every\r\n      trade, when he foresees that it is likely to be more than commonly\r\n      profitable, and he quits it when he foresees that its profits are likely\r\n      to return to the level of other trades. His profits and losses, therefore,\r\n      can bear no regular proportion to those of any one established and\r\n      well-known branch of business. A bold adventurer may sometimes acquire a\r\n      considerable fortune by two or three successful speculations, but is just\r\n      as likely to lose one by two or three unsuccessful ones. This trade can be\r\n      carried on nowhere but in great towns. It is only in places of the most\r\n      extensive commerce and correspondence that the intelligence requisite for\r\n      it can be had.\r\n\r\n      The five circumstances above mentioned, though they occasion considerable\r\n      inequalities in the wages of labour and profits of stock, occasion none in\r\n      the whole of the advantages and disadvantages, real or imaginary, of the\r\n      different employments of either. The nature of those circumstances is\r\n      such, that they make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and\r\n      counterbalance a great one in others.\r\n\r\n      In order, however, that this equality may take place in the whole of their\r\n      advantages or disadvantages, three things are requisite, even where there\r\n      is the most perfect freedom. First the employments must be well known and\r\n      long established in the neighbourhood; secondly, they must be in their\r\n      ordinary, or what may be called their natural state; and, thirdly, they\r\n      must be the sole or principal employments of those who occupy them.\r\n\r\n      First, this equality can take place only in those employments which are\r\n      well known, and have been long established in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n      Where all other circumstances are equal, wages are generally higher in new\r\n      than in old trades. When a projector attempts to establish a new\r\n      manufacture, he must at first entice his workmen from other employments,\r\n      by higher wages than they can either earn in their own trades, or than the\r\n      nature of his work would otherwise require; and a considerable time must\r\n      pass away before he can venture to reduce them to the common level.\r\n      Manufactures for which the demand arises altogether from fashion and\r\n      fancy, are continually changing, and seldom last long enough to be\r\n      considered as old established manufactures. Those, on the contrary, for\r\n      which the demand arises chiefly from use or necessity, are less liable to\r\n      change, and the same form or fabric may continue in demand for whole\r\n      centuries together. The wages of labour, therefore, are likely to be\r\n      higher in manufactures of the former, than in those of the latter kind.\r\n      Birmingham deals chiefly in manufactures of the former kind; Sheffield in\r\n      those of the latter; and the wages of labour in those two different places\r\n      are said to be suitable to this difference in the nature of their\r\n      manufactures.\r\n\r\n      The establishment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce,\r\n      or of any new practice in agriculture, is always a speculation from which\r\n      the projector promises himself extraordinary profits. These profits\r\n      sometimes are very great, and sometimes, more frequently, perhaps, they\r\n      are quite otherwise; but, in general, they bear no regular proportion to\r\n      those of other old trades in the neighbourhood. If the project succeeds,\r\n      they are commonly at first very high. When the trade or practice becomes\r\n      thoroughly established and well known, the competition reduces them to the\r\n      level of other trades.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages\r\n      of the different employments of labour and stock, can take place only in\r\n      the ordinary, or what may be called the natural state of those\r\n      employments.\r\n\r\n      The demand for almost every different species of labour is sometimes\r\n      greater, and sometimes less than usual. In the one case, the advantages of\r\n      the employment rise above, in the other they fall below the common level.\r\n      The demand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harvest than\r\n      during the greater part of the year; and wages rise with the demand. In\r\n      time of war, when forty or fifty thousand sailors are forced from the\r\n      merchant service into that of the king, the demand for sailors to merchant\r\n      ships necessarily rises with their scarcity; and their wages, upon such\r\n      occasions, commonly rise from a guinea and seven-and-twenty shillings to\r\n      forty shillings and three pounds a-month. In a decaying manufacture, on\r\n      the contrary, many workmen, rather than quit their own trade, are\r\n      contented with smaller wages than would otherwise be suitable to the\r\n      nature of their employment.\r\n\r\n      The profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which it is\r\n      employed. As the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary or\r\n      average rate, the profits of at least some part of the stock that is\r\n      employed in bringing it to market, rise above their proper level, and as\r\n      it falls they sink below it. All commodities are more or less liable to\r\n      variations of price, but some are much more so than others. In all\r\n      commodities which are produced by human industry, the quantity of industry\r\n      annually employed is necessarily regulated by the annual demand, in such a\r\n      manner that the average annual produce may, as nearly as possible, be\r\n      equal to the average annual consumption. In some employments, it has\r\n      already been observed, the same quantity of industry will always produce\r\n      the same, or very nearly the same quantity of commodities. In the linen or\r\n      woollen manufactures, for example, the same number of hands will annually\r\n      work up very nearly the same quantity of linen and woollen cloth. The\r\n      variations in the market price of such commodities, therefore, can arise\r\n      only from some accidental variation in the demand. A public mourning\r\n      raises the price of black cloth. But as the demand for most sorts of plain\r\n      linen and woollen cloth is pretty uniform, so is likewise the price. But\r\n      there are other employments in which the same quantity of industry will\r\n      not always produce the same quantity of commodities. The same quantity of\r\n      industry, for example, will, in different years, produce very different\r\n      quantities of corn, wine, hops, sugar, tobacco, etc. The price of such\r\n      commodities, therefore, varies not only with the variations of demand, but\r\n      with the much greater and more frequent variations of quantity, and is\r\n      consequently extremely fluctuating; but the profit of some of the dealers\r\n      must necessarily fluctuate with the price of the commodities. The\r\n      operations of the speculative merchant are principally employed about such\r\n      commodities. He endeavours to buy them up when he foresees that their\r\n      price is likely to rise, and to sell them when it is likely to fall.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of\r\n      the different employments of labour and stock, can take place only in such\r\n      as are the sole or principal employments of those who occupy them.\r\n\r\n      When a person derives his subsistence from one employment, which does not\r\n      occupy the greater part of his time, in the intervals of his leisure he is\r\n      often willing to work at another for less wages than would otherwise suit\r\n      the nature of the employment.\r\n\r\n      There still subsists, in many parts of Scotland, a set of people called\r\n      cottars or cottagers, though they were more frequent some years ago than\r\n      they are now. They are a sort of out-servants of the landlords and\r\n      farmers. The usual reward which they receive from their master is a house,\r\n      a small garden for pot-herbs, as much grass as will feed a cow, and,\r\n      perhaps, an acre or two of bad arable land. When their master has occasion\r\n      for their labour, he gives them, besides, two pecks of oatmeal a-week,\r\n      worth about sixteen pence sterling. During a great part of the year, he\r\n      has little or no occasion for their labour, and the cultivation of their\r\n      own little possession is not sufficient to occupy the time which is left\r\n      at their own disposal. When such occupiers were more numerous than they\r\n      are at present, they are said to have been willing to give their spare\r\n      time for a very small recompence to any body, and to have wrought for less\r\n      wages than other labourers. In ancient times, they seem to have been\r\n      common all over Europe. In countries ill cultivated, and worse inhabited,\r\n      the greater part of landlords and farmers could not otherwise provide\r\n      themselves with the extraordinary number of hands which country labour\r\n      requires at certain seasons. The daily or weekly recompence which such\r\n      labourers occasionally received from their masters, was evidently not the\r\n      whole price of their labour. Their small tenement made a considerable part\r\n      of it. This daily or weekly recompence, however, seems to have been\r\n      considered as the whole of it, by many writers who have collected the\r\n      prices of labour and provisions in ancient times, and who have taken\r\n      pleasure in representing both as wonderfully low.\r\n\r\n      The produce of such labour comes frequently cheaper to market than would\r\n      otherwise be suitable to its nature. Stockings, in many parts of Scotland,\r\n      are knit much cheaper than they can anywhere be wrought upon the loom.\r\n      They are the work of servants and labourers who derive the principal part\r\n      of their subsistence from some other employment. More than a thousand pair\r\n      of Shetland stockings are annually imported into Leith, of which the price\r\n      is from fivepence to seven-pence a pair. At Lerwick, the small capital of\r\n      the Shetland islands, tenpence a-day, I have been assured, is a common\r\n      price of common labour. In the same islands, they knit worsted stockings\r\n      to the value of a guinea a pair and upwards.\r\n\r\n      The spinning of linen yarn is carried on in Scotland nearly in the same\r\n      way as the knitting of stockings, by servants, who are chiefly hired for\r\n      other purposes. They earn but a very scanty subsistence, who endeavour to\r\n      get their livelihood by either of those trades. In most parts of Scotland,\r\n      she is a good spinner who can earn twentypence a-week.\r\n\r\n      In opulent countries, the market is generally so extensive, that any one\r\n      trade is sufficient to employ the whole labour and stock of those who\r\n      occupy it. Instances of people living by one employment, and, at the same\r\n      time, deriving some little advantage from another, occur chiefly in poor\r\n      countries. The following instance, however, of something of the same kind,\r\n      is to be found in the capital of a very rich one. There is no city in\r\n      Europe, I believe, in which house-rent is dearer than in London, and yet I\r\n      know no capital in which a furnished apartment can be hired so cheap.\r\n      Lodging is not only much cheaper in London than in Paris; it is much\r\n      cheaper than in Edinburgh, of the same degree of goodness; and, what may\r\n      seem extraordinary, the dearness of house-rent is the cause of the\r\n      cheapness of lodging. The dearness of house-rent in London arises, not\r\n      only from those causes which render it dear in all great capitals, the\r\n      dearness of labour, the dearness of all the materials of building, which\r\n      must generally be brought from a great distance, and, above all, the\r\n      dearness of ground-rent, every landlord acting the part of a monopolist,\r\n      and frequently exacting a higher rent for a single acre of bad land in a\r\n      town, than can be had for a hundred of the best in the country; but it\r\n      arises in part from the peculiar manners and customs of the people, which\r\n      oblige every master of a family to hire a whole house from top to bottom.\r\n      A dwelling-house in England means every thing that is contained under the\r\n      same roof. In France, Scotland, and many other parts of Europe, it\r\n      frequently means no more than a single storey. A tradesman in London is\r\n      obliged to hire a whole house in that part of the town where his customers\r\n      live. His shop is upon the ground floor, and he and his family sleep in\r\n      the garret; and he endeavours to pay a part of his house-rent by letting\r\n      the two middle storeys to lodgers. He expects to maintain his family by\r\n      his trade, and not by his lodgers. Whereas at Paris and Edinburgh, people\r\n      who let lodgings have commonly no other means of subsistence; and the\r\n      price of the lodging must pay, not only the rent of the house, but the\r\n      whole expense of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART II.—Inequalities occasioned by the Policy of Europe.\r\n\r\n      Such are the inequalities in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages\r\n      of the different employments of labour and stock, which the defect of any\r\n      of the three requisites above mentioned must occasion, even where there is\r\n      the most perfect liberty. But the policy of Europe, by not leaving things\r\n      at perfect liberty, occasions other inequalities of much greater\r\n      importance.\r\n\r\n      It does this chiefly in the three following ways. First, by restraining\r\n      the competition in some employments to a smaller number than would\r\n      otherwise be disposed to enter into them; secondly, by increasing it in\r\n      others beyond what it naturally would be; and, thirdly, by obstructing the\r\n      free circulation of labour and stock, both from employment to employment,\r\n      and from place to place.\r\n\r\n      First, The policy of Europe occasions a very important inequality in the\r\n      whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of\r\n      labour and stock, by restraining the competition in some employments to a\r\n      smaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into them.\r\n\r\n      The exclusive privileges of corporations are the principal means it makes\r\n      use of for this purpose.\r\n\r\n      The exclusive privilege of an incorporated trade necessarily restrains the\r\n      competition, in the town where it is established, to those who are free of\r\n      the trade. To have served an apprenticeship in the town, under a master\r\n      properly qualified, is commonly the necessary requisite for obtaining this\r\n      freedom. The bye-laws of the corporation regulate sometimes the number of\r\n      apprentices which any master is allowed to have, and almost always the\r\n      number of years which each apprentice is obliged to serve. The intention\r\n      of both regulations is to restrain the competition to a much smaller\r\n      number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade. The\r\n      limitation of the number of apprentices restrains it directly. A long term\r\n      of apprenticeship restrains it more indirectly, but as effectually, by\r\n      increasing the expense of education.\r\n\r\n      In Sheffield, no master cutler can have more than one apprentice at a\r\n      time, by a bye-law of the corporation. In Norfolk and Norwich, no master\r\n      weaver can have more than two apprentices, under pain of forfeiting five\r\n      pounds a-month to the king. No master hatter can have more than two\r\n      apprentices anywhere in England, or in the English plantations, under pain\r\n      of forfeiting; five pounds a-month, half to the king, and half to him who\r\n      shall sue in any court of record. Both these regulations, though they have\r\n      been confirmed by a public law of the kingdom, are evidently dictated by\r\n      the same corporation-spirit which enacted the bye-law of Sheffield. The\r\n      silk-weavers in London had scarce been incorporated a year, when they\r\n      enacted a bye-law, restraining any master from having more than two\r\n      apprentices at a time. It required a particular act of parliament to\r\n      rescind this bye-law.\r\n\r\n      Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual term\r\n      established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of\r\n      incorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called\r\n      universities, which, indeed, is the proper Latin name for any\r\n      incorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of\r\n      tailors, etc. are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old\r\n      charters of ancient towns. When those particular incorporations, which are\r\n      now peculiarly called universities, were first established, the term of\r\n      years which it was necessary to study, in order to obtain the degree of\r\n      master of arts, appears evidently to have been copied from the term of\r\n      apprenticeship in common trades, of which the incorporations were much\r\n      more ancient. As to have wrought seven years under a master properly\r\n      qualified, was necessary, in order to entitle any person to become a\r\n      master, and to have himself apprentices in a common trade; so to have\r\n      studied seven years under a master properly qualified, was necessary to\r\n      entitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words anciently\r\n      synonymous), in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or apprentices\r\n      (words likewise originally synonymous) to study under him.\r\n\r\n      By the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statute of Apprenticeship, it\r\n      was enacted, that no person should, for the future, exercise any trade,\r\n      craft, or mystery, at that time exercised in England, unless he had\r\n      previously served to it an apprenticeship of seven years at least; and\r\n      what before had been the bye-law of many particular corporations, became\r\n      in England the general and public law of all trades carried on in market\r\n      towns. For though the words of the statute are very general, and seem\r\n      plainly to include the whole kingdom, by interpretation its operation has\r\n      been limited to market towns; it having been held that, in country\r\n      villages, a person may exercise several different trades, though he has\r\n      not served a seven years apprenticeship to each, they being necessary for\r\n      the conveniency of the inhabitants, and the number of people frequently\r\n      not being sufficient to supply each with a particular set of hands. By a\r\n      strict interpretation of the words, too, the operation of this statute has\r\n      been limited to those trades which were established in England before the\r\n      5th of Elizabeth, and has never been extended to such as have been\r\n      introduced since that time. This limitation has given occasion to several\r\n      distinctions, which, considered as rules of police, appear as foolish as\r\n      can well be imagined. It has been adjudged, for example, that a\r\n      coach-maker can neither himself make nor employ journeymen to make his\r\n      coach-wheels, but must buy them of a master wheel-wright; this latter\r\n      trade having been exercised in England before the 5th of Elizabeth. But a\r\n      wheel-wright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a\r\n      coachmaker, may either himself make or employ journeymen to make coaches;\r\n      the trade of a coachmaker not being within the statute, because not\r\n      exercised in England at the time when it was made. The manufactures of\r\n      Manchester, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, are many of them, upon this\r\n      account, not within the statute, not having been exercised in England\r\n      before the 5th of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n      In France, the duration of apprenticeships is different in different towns\r\n      and in different trades. In Paris, five years is the term required in a\r\n      great number; but, before any person can be qualified to exercise the\r\n      trade as a master, he must, in many of them, serve five years more as a\r\n      journeyman. During this latter term, he is called the companion of his\r\n      master, and the term itself is called his companionship.\r\n\r\n      In Scotland, there is no general law which regulates universally the\r\n      duration of apprenticeships. The term is different in different\r\n      corporations. Where it is long, a part of it may generally be redeemed by\r\n      paying a small fine. In most towns, too, a very small fine is sufficient\r\n      to purchase the freedom of any corporation. The weavers of linen and\r\n      hempen cloth, the principal manufactures of the country, as well as all\r\n      other artificers subservient to them, wheel-makers, reel-makers, etc. may\r\n      exercise their trades in any town-corporate without paying any fine. In\r\n      all towns-corporate, all persons are free to sell butchers’ meat upon any\r\n      lawful day of the week. Three years is, in Scotland, a common term of\r\n      apprenticeship, even in some very nice trades; and, in general, I know of\r\n      no country in Europe, in which corporation laws are so little oppressive.\r\n\r\n      The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original\r\n      foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable.\r\n      The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his\r\n      hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in\r\n      what manner he thinks proper, without injury to his neighbour, is a plain\r\n      violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon\r\n      the just liberty, both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed\r\n      to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks\r\n      proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To\r\n      judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the\r\n      discretion of the employers, whose interest it so much concerns. The\r\n      affected anxiety of the lawgiver, lest they should employ an improper\r\n      person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive.\r\n\r\n      The institution of long apprenticeships can give no security that\r\n      insufficient workmanship shall not frequently be exposed to public sale.\r\n      When this is done, it is generally the effect of fraud, and not of\r\n      inability; and the longest apprenticeship can give no security against\r\n      fraud. Quite different regulations are necessary to prevent this abuse.\r\n      The sterling mark upon plate, and the stamps upon linen and woollen cloth,\r\n      give the purchaser much greater security than any statute of\r\n      apprenticeship. He generally looks at these, but never thinks it worth\r\n      while to enquire whether the workman had served a seven years\r\n      apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n      The institution of long apprenticeships has no tendency to form young\r\n      people to industry. A journeyman who works by the piece is likely to be\r\n      industrious, because he derives a benefit from every exertion of his\r\n      industry. An apprentice is likely to be idle, and almost always is so,\r\n      because he has no immediate interest to be otherwise. In the inferior\r\n      employments, the sweets of labour consist altogether in the recompence of\r\n      labour. They who are soonest in a condition to enjoy the sweets of it, are\r\n      likely soonest to conceive a relish for it, and to acquire the early habit\r\n      of industry. A young man naturally conceives an aversion to labour, when\r\n      for a long time he receives no benefit from it. The boys who are put out\r\n      apprentices from public charities are generally bound for more than the\r\n      usual number of years, and they generally turn out very idle and\r\n      worthless.\r\n\r\n      Apprenticeships were altogether unknown to the ancients. The reciprocal\r\n      duties of master and apprentice make a considerable article in every\r\n      modern code. The Roman law is perfectly silent with regard to them. I know\r\n      no Greek or Latin word (I might venture, I believe, to assert that there\r\n      is none) which expresses the idea we now annex to the word apprentice, a\r\n      servant bound to work at a particular trade for the benefit of a master,\r\n      during a term of years, upon condition that the master shall teach him\r\n      that trade.\r\n\r\n      Long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary. The arts, which are much\r\n      superior to common trades, such as those of making clocks and watches,\r\n      contain no such mystery as to require a long course of instruction. The\r\n      first invention of such beautiful machines, indeed, and even that of some\r\n      of the instruments employed in making them, must no doubt have been the\r\n      work of deep thought and long time, and may justly be considered as among\r\n      the happiest efforts of human ingenuity. But when both have been fairly\r\n      invented, and are well understood, to explain to any young man, in the\r\n      completest manner, how to apply the instruments, and how to construct the\r\n      machines, cannot well require more than the lessons of a few weeks;\r\n      perhaps those of a few days might be sufficient. In the common mechanic\r\n      trades, those of a few days might certainly be sufficient. The dexterity\r\n      of hand, indeed, even in common trades, cannot be acquired without much\r\n      practice and experience. But a young man would practice with much more\r\n      diligence and attention, if from the beginning he wrought as a journeyman,\r\n      being paid in proportion to the little work which he could execute, and\r\n      paying in his turn for the materials which he might sometimes spoil\r\n      through awkwardness and inexperience. His education would generally in\r\n      this way be more effectual, and always less tedious and expensive. The\r\n      master, indeed, would be a loser. He would lose all the wages of the\r\n      apprentice, which he now saves, for seven years together. In the end,\r\n      perhaps, the apprentice himself would be a loser. In a trade so easily\r\n      learnt he would have more competitors, and his wages, when he came to be a\r\n      complete workman, would be much less than at present. The same increase of\r\n      competition would reduce the profits of the masters, as well as the wages\r\n      of workmen. The trades, the crafts, the mysteries, would all be losers.\r\n      But the public would be a gainer, the work of all artificers coming in\r\n      this way much cheaper to market.\r\n\r\n      It is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages and\r\n      profit, by restraining that free competition which would most certainly\r\n      occasion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation\r\n      laws have been established. In order to erect a corporation, no other\r\n      authority in ancient times was requisite, in many parts of Europe, but\r\n      that of the town-corporate in which it was established. In England,\r\n      indeed, a charter from the king was likewise necessary. But this\r\n      prerogative of the crown seems to have been reserved rather for extorting\r\n      money from the subject, than for the defence of the common liberty against\r\n      such oppressive monopolies. Upon paying a fine to the king, the charter\r\n      seems generally to have been readily granted; and when any particular\r\n      class of artificers or traders thought proper to act as a corporation,\r\n      without a charter, such adulterine guilds, as they were called, were not\r\n      always disfranchised upon that account, but obliged to fine annually to\r\n      the king, for permission to exercise their usurped privileges {See Madox\r\n      Firma Burgi p. 26 etc.}. The immediate inspection of all corporations, and\r\n      of the bye-laws which they might think proper to enact for their own\r\n      government, belonged to the town-corporate in which they were established;\r\n      and whatever discipline was exercised over them, proceeded commonly, not\r\n      from the king, but from that greater incorporation of which those\r\n      subordinate ones were only parts or members.\r\n\r\n      The government of towns-corporate was altogether in the hands of traders\r\n      and artificers, and it was the manifest interest of every particular class\r\n      of them, to prevent the market from being overstocked, as they commonly\r\n      express it, with their own particular species of industry; which is in\r\n      reality to keep it always understocked. Each class was eager to establish\r\n      regulations proper for this purpose, and, provided it was allowed to do\r\n      so, was willing to consent that every other class should do the same. In\r\n      consequence of such regulations, indeed, each class was obliged to buy the\r\n      goods they had occasion for from every other within the town, somewhat\r\n      dearer than they otherwise might have done. But, in recompence, they were\r\n      enabled to sell their own just as much dearer; so that, so far it was as\r\n      broad as long, as they say; and in the dealings of the different classes\r\n      within the town with one another, none of them were losers by these\r\n      regulations. But in their dealings with the country they were all great\r\n      gainers; and in these latter dealings consist the whole trade which\r\n      supports and enriches every town.\r\n\r\n      Every town draws its whole subsistence, and all the materials of its\r\n      industry, from the country. It pays for these chiefly in two ways. First,\r\n      by sending back to the country a part of those materials wrought up and\r\n      manufactured; in which case, their price is augmented by the wages of the\r\n      workmen, and the profits of their masters or immediate employers;\r\n      secondly, by sending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured\r\n      produce, either of other countries, or of distant parts of the same\r\n      country, imported into the town; in which case, too, the original price of\r\n      those goods is augmented by the wages of the carriers or sailors, and by\r\n      the profits of the merchants who employ them. In what is gained upon the\r\n      first of those branches of commerce, consists the advantage which the town\r\n      makes by its manufactures; in what is gained upon the second, the\r\n      advantage of its inland and foreign trade. The wages of the workmen, and\r\n      the profits of their different employers, make up the whole of what is\r\n      gained upon both. Whatever regulations, therefore, tend to increase those\r\n      wages and profits beyond what they otherwise: would be, tend to enable the\r\n      town to purchase, with a smaller quantity of its labour, the produce of a\r\n      greater quantity of the labour of the country. They give the traders and\r\n      artificers in the town an advantage over the landlords, farmers, and\r\n      labourers, in the country, and break down that natural equality which\r\n      would otherwise take place in the commerce which is carried on between\r\n      them. The whole annual produce of the labour of the society is annually\r\n      divided between those two different sets of people. By means of those\r\n      regulations, a greater share of it is given to the inhabitants of the town\r\n      than would otherwise fall to them, and a less to those of the country.\r\n\r\n      The price which the town really pays for the provisions and materials\r\n      annually imported into it, is the quantity of manufactures and other goods\r\n      annually exported from it. The dearer the latter are sold, the cheaper the\r\n      former are bought. The industry of the town becomes more, and that of the\r\n      country less advantageous.\r\n\r\n      That the industry which is carried on in towns is, everywhere in Europe,\r\n      more advantageous than that which is carried on in the country, without\r\n      entering into any very nice computations, we may satisfy ourselves by one\r\n      very simple and obvious observation. In every country of Europe, we find\r\n      at least a hundred people who have acquired great fortunes, from small\r\n      beginnings, by trade and manufactures, the industry which properly belongs\r\n      to towns, for one who has done so by that which properly belongs to the\r\n      country, the raising of rude produce by the improvement and cultivation of\r\n      land. Industry, therefore, must be better rewarded, the wages of labour\r\n      and the profits of stock must evidently be greater, in the one situation\r\n      than in the other. But stock and labour naturally seek the most\r\n      advantageous employment. They naturally, therefore, resort as much as they\r\n      can to the town, and desert the country.\r\n\r\n      The inhabitants of a town being collected into one place, can easily\r\n      combine together. The most insignificant trades carried on in towns have,\r\n      accordingly, in some place or other, been incorporated; and even where\r\n      they have never been incorporated, yet the corporation-spirit, the\r\n      jealousy of strangers, the aversion to take apprentices, or to communicate\r\n      the secret of their trade, generally prevail in them, and often teach\r\n      them, by voluntary associations and agreements, to prevent that free\r\n      competition which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws. The trades which\r\n      employ but a small number of hands, run most easily into such\r\n      combinations. Half-a-dozen wool-combers, perhaps, are necessary to keep a\r\n      thousand spinners and weavers at work. By combining not to take\r\n      apprentices, they can not only engross the employment, but reduce the\r\n      whole manufacture into a sort of slavery to themselves, and raise the\r\n      price of their labour much above what is due to the nature of their work.\r\n\r\n      The inhabitants of the country, dispersed in distant places, cannot easily\r\n      combine together. They have not only never been incorporated, but the\r\n      incorporation spirit never has prevailed among them. No apprenticeship has\r\n      ever been thought necessary to qualify for husbandry, the great trade of\r\n      the country. After what are called the fine arts, and the liberal\r\n      professions, however, there is perhaps no trade which requires so great a\r\n      variety of knowledge and experience. The innumerable volumes which have\r\n      been written upon it in all languages, may satisfy us, that among the\r\n      wisest and most learned nations, it has never been regarded as a matter\r\n      very easily understood. And from all those volumes we shall in vain\r\n      attempt to collect that knowledge of its various and complicated\r\n      operations which is commonly possessed even by the common farmer; how\r\n      contemptuously soever the very contemptible authors of some of them may\r\n      sometimes affect to speak of him. There is scarce any common mechanic\r\n      trade, on the contrary, of which all the operations may not be as\r\n      completely and distinctly explained in a pamphlet of a very few pages, as\r\n      it is possible for words illustrated by figures to explain them. In the\r\n      history of the arts, now publishing by the French Academy of Sciences,\r\n      several of them are actually explained in this manner. The direction of\r\n      operations, besides, which must be varied with every change of the\r\n      weather, as well as with many other accidents, requires much more judgment\r\n      and discretion, than that of those which are always the same, or very\r\n      nearly the same.\r\n\r\n      Not only the art of the farmer, the general direction of the operations of\r\n      husbandry, but many inferior branches of country labour require much more\r\n      skill and experience than the greater part of mechanic trades. The man who\r\n      works upon brass and iron, works with instruments, and upon materials of\r\n      which the temper is always the same, or very nearly the same. But the man\r\n      who ploughs the ground with a team of horses or oxen, works with\r\n      instruments of which the health, strength, and temper, are very different\r\n      upon different occasions. The condition of the materials which he works\r\n      upon, too, is as variable as that of the instruments which he works with,\r\n      and both require to be managed with much judgment and discretion. The\r\n      common ploughman, though generally regarded as the pattern of stupidity\r\n      and ignorance, is seldom defective in this judgment and discretion. He is\r\n      less accustomed, indeed, to social intercourse, than the mechanic who\r\n      lives in a town. His voice and language are more uncouth, and more\r\n      difficult to be understood by those who are not used to them. His\r\n      understanding, however, being accustomed to consider a greater variety of\r\n      objects, is generally much superior to that of the other, whose whole\r\n      attention, from morning till night, is commonly occupied in performing one\r\n      or two very simple operations. How much the lower ranks of people in the\r\n      country are really superior to those of the town, is well known to every\r\n      man whom either business or curiosity has led to converse much with both.\r\n      In China and Indostan, accordingly, both the rank and the wages of country\r\n      labourers are said to be superior to those of the greater part of\r\n      artificers and manufacturers. They would probably be so everywhere, if\r\n      corporation laws and the corporation spirit did not prevent it.\r\n\r\n      The superiority which the industry of the towns has everywhere in Europe\r\n      over that of the country, is not altogether owing to corporations and\r\n      corporation laws. It is supported by many other regulations. The high\r\n      duties upon foreign manufactures, and upon all goods imported by alien\r\n      merchants, all tend to the same purpose. Corporation laws enable the\r\n      inhabitants of towns to raise their prices, without fearing to be\r\n      undersold by the free competition of their own countrymen. Those other\r\n      regulations secure them equally against that of foreigners. The\r\n      enhancement of price occasioned by both is everywhere finally paid by the\r\n      landlords, farmers, and labourers, of the country, who have seldom opposed\r\n      the establishment of such monopolies. They have commonly neither\r\n      inclination nor fitness to enter into combinations; and the clamour and\r\n      sophistry of merchants and manufacturers easily persuade them, that the\r\n      private interest of a part, and of a subordinate part, of the society, is\r\n      the general interest of the whole.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, the superiority of the industry of the towns over that\r\n      of the country seems to have been greater formerly than in the present\r\n      times. The wages of country labour approach nearer to those of\r\n      manufacturing labour, and the profits of stock employed in agriculture to\r\n      those of trading and manufacturing stock, than they are said to have done\r\n      in the last century, or in the beginning of the present. This change may\r\n      be regarded as the necessary, though very late consequence of the\r\n      extraordinary encouragement given to the industry of the towns. The stocks\r\n      accumulated in them come in time to be so great, that it can no longer be\r\n      employed with the ancient profit in that species of industry which is\r\n      peculiar to them. That industry has its limits like every other; and the\r\n      increase of stock, by increasing the competition, necessarily reduces the\r\n      profit. The lowering of profit in the town forces out stock to the\r\n      country, where, by creating a new demand for country labour, it\r\n      necessarily raises its wages. It then spreads itself, if I my say so, over\r\n      the face of the land, and, by being employed in agriculture, is in part\r\n      restored to the country, at the expense of which, in a great measure, it\r\n      had originally been accumulated in the town. That everywhere in Europe the\r\n      greatest improvements of the country have been owing to such over flowings\r\n      of the stock originally accumulated in the towns, I shall endeavour to\r\n      shew hereafter, and at the same time to demonstrate, that though some\r\n      countries have, by this course, attained to a considerable degree of\r\n      opulence, it is in itself necessarily slow, uncertain, liable to be\r\n      disturbed and interrupted by innumerable accidents, and, in every respect,\r\n      contrary to the order of nature and of reason. The interests, prejudices,\r\n      laws, and customs, which have given occasion to it, I shall endeavour to\r\n      explain as fully and distinctly as I can in the third and fourth books of\r\n      this Inquiry.\r\n\r\n      People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and\r\n      diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public,\r\n      or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible, indeed, to\r\n      prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would\r\n      be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder\r\n      people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to\r\n      do nothing to facilitate such assemblies, much less to render them\r\n      necessary.\r\n\r\n      A regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular\r\n      town to enter their names and places of abode in a public register,\r\n      facilitates such assemblies. It connects individuals who might never\r\n      otherwise be known to one another, and gives every man of the trade a\r\n      direction where to find every other man of it.\r\n\r\n      A regulation which enables those of the same trade to tax themselves, in\r\n      order to provide for their poor, their sick, their widows and orphans, by\r\n      giving them a common interest to manage, renders such assemblies\r\n      necessary.\r\n\r\n      An incorporation not only renders them necessary, but makes the act of the\r\n      majority binding upon the whole. In a free trade, an effectual combination\r\n      cannot be established but by the unanimous consent of every single trader,\r\n      and it cannot last longer than every single trader continues of the same\r\n      mind. The majority of a corporation can enact a bye-law, with proper\r\n      penalties, which will limit the competition more effectually and more\r\n      durably than any voluntary combination whatever.\r\n\r\n      The pretence that corporations are necessary for the better government of\r\n      the trade, is without any foundation. The real and effectual discipline\r\n      which is exercised over a workman, is not that of his corporation, but\r\n      that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which\r\n      restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence. An exclusive corporation\r\n      necessarily weakens the force of this discipline. A particular set of\r\n      workmen must then be employed, let them behave well or ill. It is upon\r\n      this account that, in many large incorporated towns, no tolerable workmen\r\n      are to be found, even in some of the most necessary trades. If you would\r\n      have your work tolerably executed, it must be done in the suburbs, where\r\n      the workmen, having no exclusive privilege, have nothing but their\r\n      character to depend upon, and you must then smuggle it into the town as\r\n      well as you can.\r\n\r\n      It is in this manner that the policy of Europe, by restraining the\r\n      competition in some employments to a smaller number than would otherwise\r\n      be disposed to enter into them, occasions a very important inequality in\r\n      the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments\r\n      of labour and stock.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, the policy of Europe, by increasing the competition in some\r\n      employments beyond what it naturally would be, occasions another\r\n      inequality, of an opposite kind, in the whole of the advantages and\r\n      disadvantages of the different employments of labour and stock.\r\n\r\n      It has been considered as of so much importance that a proper number of\r\n      young people should be educated for certain professions, that sometimes\r\n      the public, and sometimes the piety of private founders, have established\r\n      many pensions, scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries, etc. for this\r\n      purpose, which draw many more people into those trades than could\r\n      otherwise pretend to follow them. In all Christian countries, I believe,\r\n      the education of the greater part of churchmen is paid for in this\r\n      manner. Very few of them are educated altogether at their own expense.\r\n      The long, tedious, and expensive education, therefore, of those who are,\r\n      will not always procure them a suitable reward, the church being crowded\r\n      with people, who, in order to get employment, are willing to accept of a\r\n      much smaller recompence than what such an education would otherwise have\r\n      entitled them to; and in this manner the competition of the poor takes\r\n      away the reward of the rich. It would be indecent, no doubt, to compare\r\n      either a curate or a chaplain with a journeyman in any common trade. The\r\n      pay of a curate or chaplain, however, may very properly be considered as\r\n      of the same nature with the wages of a journeyman. They are all three\r\n      paid for their work according to the contract which they may happen to\r\n      make with their respective superiors. Till after the middle of the\r\n      fourteenth century, five merks, containing about as much silver as ten\r\n      pounds of our present money, was in England the usual pay of a curate or\r\n      a stipendiary parish priest, as we find it regulated by the decrees of\r\n      several different national councils. At the same period, fourpence a-day,\r\n      containing the same quantity of silver as a shilling of our present\r\n      money, was declared to be the pay of a master mason; and threepence\r\n      a-day, equal to ninepence of our present money, that of a journeyman\r\n      mason. {See the Statute of Labourers, 25, Ed. III.} The wages of both\r\n      these labourers, therefore, supposing them to have been constantly\r\n      employed, were much superior to those of the curate. The wages of the\r\n      master mason, supposing him to have been without employment one-third of\r\n      the year, would have fully equalled them. By the 12th of Queen Anne, c.\r\n      12. it is declared, “That whereas, for want of sufficient\r\n      maintenance and encouragement to curates, the cures have, in several\r\n      places, been meanly supplied, the bishop is, therefore, empowered to\r\n      appoint, by writing under his hand and seal, a sufficient certain stipend\r\n      or allowance, not exceeding fifty, and not less than twenty pounds\r\n      a-year”. Forty pounds a-year is reckoned at present very good pay\r\n      for a curate; and, notwithstanding this act of parliament, there are many\r\n      curacies under twenty pounds a-year. There are journeymen shoemakers in\r\n      London who earn forty pounds a-year, and there is scarce an industrious\r\n      workman of any kind in that metropolis who does not earn more than\r\n      twenty. This last sum, indeed, does not exceed what is frequently earned\r\n      by common labourers in many country parishes. Whenever the law has\r\n      attempted to regulate the wages of workmen, it has always been rather to\r\n      lower them than to raise them. But the law has, upon many occasions,\r\n      attempted to raise the wages of curates, and, for the dignity of the\r\n      church, to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the\r\n      wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of.\r\n      And, in both cases, the law seems to have been equally ineffectual, and\r\n      has never either been able to raise the wages of curates, or to sink\r\n      those of labourers to the degree that was intended; because it has never\r\n      been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less\r\n      than the legal allowance, on account of the indigence of their situation\r\n      and the multitude of their competitors, or the other from receiving more,\r\n      on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive\r\n      either profit or pleasure from employing them.\r\n\r\n      The great benefices and other ecclesiastical dignities support the honour\r\n      of the church, notwithstanding the mean circumstances of some of its\r\n      inferior members. The respect paid to the profession, too, makes some\r\n      compensation even to them for the meanness of their pecuniary recompence.\r\n      In England, and in all Roman catholic countries, the lottery of the church\r\n      is in reality much more advantageous than is necessary. The example of the\r\n      churches of Scotland, of Geneva, and of several other protestant churches,\r\n      may satisfy us, that in so creditable a profession, in which education is\r\n      so easily procured, the hopes of much more moderate benefices will draw a\r\n      sufficient number of learned, decent, and respectable men into holy\r\n      orders.\r\n\r\n      In professions in which there are no benefices, such as law and physic, if\r\n      an equal proportion of people were educated at the public expense, the\r\n      competition would soon be so great as to sink very much their pecuniary\r\n      reward. It might then not be worth any man’s while to educate his son to\r\n      either of those professions at his own expense. They would be entirely\r\n      abandoned to such as had been educated by those public charities, whose\r\n      numbers and necessities would oblige them in general to content themselves\r\n      with a very miserable recompence, to the entire degradation of the now\r\n      respectable professions of law and physic.\r\n\r\n      That unprosperous race of men, commonly called men of letters, are pretty\r\n      much in the situation which lawyers and physicians probably would be in,\r\n      upon the foregoing supposition. In every part of Europe, the greater part\r\n      of them have been educated for the church, but have been hindered by\r\n      different reasons from entering into holy orders. They have generally,\r\n      therefore, been educated at the public expense; and their numbers are\r\n      everywhere so great, as commonly to reduce the price of their labour to a\r\n      very paltry recompence.\r\n\r\n      Before the invention of the art of printing, the only employment by which\r\n      a man of letters could make any thing by his talents, was that of a public\r\n      or private teacher, or by communicating to other people the curious and\r\n      useful knowledge which he had acquired himself; and this is still surely a\r\n      more honourable, a more useful, and, in general, even a more profitable\r\n      employment than that other of writing for a bookseller, to which the art\r\n      of printing has given occasion. The time and study, the genius, knowledge,\r\n      and application requisite to qualify an eminent teacher of the sciences,\r\n      are at least equal to what is necessary for the greatest practitioners in\r\n      law and physic. But the usual reward of the eminent teacher bears no\r\n      proportion to that of the lawyer or physician, because the trade of the\r\n      one is crowded with indigent people, who have been brought up to it at the\r\n      public expense; whereas those of the other two are encumbered with very\r\n      few who have not been educated at their own. The usual recompence,\r\n      however, of public and private teachers, small as it may appear, would\r\n      undoubtedly be less than it is, if the competition of those yet more\r\n      indigent men of letters, who write for bread, was not taken out of the\r\n      market. Before the invention of the art of printing, a scholar and a\r\n      beggar seem to have been terms very nearly synonymous. The different\r\n      governors of the universities, before that time, appear to have often\r\n      granted licences to their scholars to beg.\r\n\r\n      In ancient times, before any charities of this kind had been established\r\n      for the education of indigent people to the learned professions, the\r\n      rewards of eminent teachers appear to have been much more considerable.\r\n      Isocrates, in what is called his discourse against the sophists,\r\n      reproaches the teachers of his own times with inconsistency. “They make\r\n      the most magnificent promises to their scholars,” says he, “and undertake\r\n      to teach them to be wise, to be happy, and to be just; and, in return for\r\n      so important a service, they stipulate the paltry reward of four or five\r\n      minae.” “They who teach wisdom,” continues he, “ought certainly to be wise\r\n      themselves; but if any man were to sell such a bargain for such a price,\r\n      he would be convicted of the most evident folly.” He certainly does not\r\n      mean here to exaggerate the reward, and we may be assured that it was not\r\n      less than he represents it. Four minae were equal to thirteen pounds six\r\n      shillings and eightpence; five minae to sixteen pounds thirteen shillings\r\n      and fourpence. Something not less than the largest of those two sums,\r\n      therefore, must at that time have been usually paid to the most eminent\r\n      teachers at Athens. Isocrates himself demanded ten minae, or £ 33:6:8 from\r\n      each scholar. When he taught at Athens, he is said to have had a hundred\r\n      scholars. I understand this to be the number whom he taught at one time,\r\n      or who attended what we would call one course of lectures; a number which\r\n      will not appear extraordinary from so great a city to so famous a teacher,\r\n      who taught, too, what was at that time the most fashionable of all\r\n      sciences, rhetoric. He must have made, therefore, by each course of\r\n      lectures, a thousand minae, or £ 3335:6:8. A thousand minae, accordingly,\r\n      is said by Plutarch, in another place, to have been his didactron, or\r\n      usual price of teaching. Many other eminent teachers in those times appear\r\n      to have acquired great fortunes. Georgias made a present to the temple of\r\n      Delphi of his own statue in solid gold. We must not, I presume, suppose\r\n      that it was as large as the life. His way of living, as well as that of\r\n      Hippias and Protagoras, two other eminent teachers of those times, is\r\n      represented by Plato as splendid, even to ostentation. Plato himself is\r\n      said to have lived with a good deal of magnificence. Aristotle, after\r\n      having been tutor to Alexander, and most munificently rewarded, as it is\r\n      universally agreed, both by him and his father, Philip, thought it worth\r\n      while, notwithstanding, to return to Athens, in order to resume the\r\n      teaching of his school. Teachers of the sciences were probably in those\r\n      times less common than they came to be in an age or two afterwards, when\r\n      the competition had probably somewhat reduced both the price of their\r\n      labour and the admiration for their persons. The most eminent of them,\r\n      however, appear always to have enjoyed a degree of consideration much\r\n      superior to any of the like profession in the present times. The Athenians\r\n      sent Carneades the academic, and Diogenes the stoic, upon a solemn embassy\r\n      to Rome; and though their city had then declined from its former grandeur,\r\n      it was still an independent and considerable republic.\r\n\r\n      Carneades, too, was a Babylonian by birth; and as there never was a people\r\n      more jealous of admitting foreigners to public offices than the Athenians,\r\n      their consideration for him must have been very great.\r\n\r\n      This inequality is, upon the whole, perhaps rather advantageous than\r\n      hurtful to the public. It may somewhat degrade the profession of a public\r\n      teacher; but the cheapness of literary education is surely an advantage\r\n      which greatly overbalances this trifling inconveniency. The public, too,\r\n      might derive still greater benefit from it, if the constitution of those\r\n      schools and colleges, in which education is carried on, was more\r\n      reasonable than it is at present through the greater part of Europe.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, the policy of Europe, by obstructing the free circulation of\r\n      labour and stock, both from employment to employment, and from place to\r\n      place, occasions, in some cases, a very inconvenient inequality in the\r\n      whole of the advantages and disadvantages of their different employments.\r\n\r\n      The statute of apprenticeship obstructs the free circulation of labour\r\n      from one employment to another, even in the same place. The exclusive\r\n      privileges of corporations obstruct it from one place to another, even in\r\n      the same employment.\r\n\r\n      It frequently happens, that while high wages are given to the workmen in\r\n      one manufacture, those in another are obliged to content themselves with\r\n      bare subsistence. The one is in an advancing state, and has therefore a\r\n      continual demand for new hands; the other is in a declining state, and the\r\n      superabundance of hands is continually increasing. Those two manufactures\r\n      may sometimes be in the same town, and sometimes in the same\r\n      neighbourhood, without being able to lend the least assistance to one\r\n      another. The statute of apprenticeship may oppose it in the one case, and\r\n      both that and an exclusive corporation in the other. In many different\r\n      manufactures, however, the operations are so much alike, that the workmen\r\n      could easily change trades with one another, if those absurd laws did not\r\n      hinder them. The arts of weaving plain linen and plain silk, for example,\r\n      are almost entirely the same. That of weaving plain woollen is somewhat\r\n      different; but the difference is so insignificant, that either a linen or\r\n      a silk weaver might become a tolerable workman in a very few days. If any\r\n      of those three capital manufactures, therefore, were decaying, the workmen\r\n      might find a resource in one of the other two which was in a more\r\n      prosperous condition; and their wages would neither rise too high in the\r\n      thriving, nor sink too low in the decaying manufacture. The linen\r\n      manufacture, indeed, is in England, by a particular statute, open to every\r\n      body; but as it is not much cultivated through the greater part of the\r\n      country, it can afford no general resource to the work men of other\r\n      decaying manufactures, who, wherever the statute of apprenticeship takes\r\n      place, have no other choice, but either to come upon the parish, or to\r\n      work as common labourers; for which, by their habits, they are much worse\r\n      qualified than for any sort of manufacture that bears any resemblance to\r\n      their own. They generally, therefore, chuse to come upon the parish.\r\n\r\n      Whatever obstructs the free circulation of labour from one employment to\r\n      another, obstructs that of stock likewise; the quantity of stock which can\r\n      be employed in any branch of business depending very much upon that of the\r\n      labour which can be employed in it. Corporation laws, however, give less\r\n      obstruction to the free circulation of stock from one place to another,\r\n      than to that of labour. It is everywhere much easier for a wealthy\r\n      merchant to obtain the privilege of trading in a town-corporate, than for\r\n      a poor artificer to obtain that of working in it.\r\n\r\n      The obstruction which corporation laws give to the free circulation of\r\n      labour is common, I believe, to every part of Europe. That which is given\r\n      to it by the poor laws is, so far as I know, peculiar to England. It\r\n      consists in the difficulty which a poor man finds in obtaining a\r\n      settlement, or even in being allowed to exercise his industry in any\r\n      parish but that to which he belongs. It is the labour of artificers and\r\n      manufacturers only of which the free circulation is obstructed by\r\n      corporation laws. The difficulty of obtaining settlements obstructs even\r\n      that of common labour. It may be worth while to give some account of the\r\n      rise, progress, and present state of this disorder, the greatest, perhaps,\r\n      of any in the police of England.\r\n\r\n      When, by the destruction of monasteries, the poor had been deprived of the\r\n      charity of those religious houses, after some other ineffectual attempts\r\n      for their relief, it was enacted, by the 43d of Elizabeth, c. 2. that\r\n      every parish should be bound to provide for its own poor, and that\r\n      overseers of the poor should be annually appointed, who, with the\r\n      church-wardens, should raise, by a parish rate, competent sums for this\r\n      purpose.\r\n\r\n      By this statute, the necessity of providing for their own poor was\r\n      indispensably imposed upon every parish. Who were to be considered as the\r\n      poor of each parish became, therefore, a question of some importance. This\r\n      question, after some variation, was at last determined by the 13th and\r\n      14th of Charles II. when it was enacted, that forty days undisturbed\r\n      residence should gain any person a settlement in any parish; but that\r\n      within that time it should be lawful for two justices of the peace, upon\r\n      complaint made by the church-wardens or overseers of the poor, to remove\r\n      any new inhabitant to the parish where he was last legally settled; unless\r\n      he either rented a tenement of ten pounds a-year, or could give such\r\n      security for the discharge of the parish where he was then living, as\r\n      those justices should judge sufficient.\r\n\r\n      Some frauds, it is said, were committed in consequence of this statute;\r\n      parish officers sometimes bribing their own poor to go clandestinely to\r\n      another parish, and, by keeping themselves concealed for forty days, to\r\n      gain a settlement there, to the discharge of that to which they properly\r\n      belonged. It was enacted, therefore, by the 1st of James II. that the\r\n      forty days undisturbed residence of any person necessary to gain a\r\n      settlement, should be accounted only from the time of his delivering\r\n      notice, in writing, of the place of his abode and the number of his\r\n      family, to one of the church-wardens or overseers of the parish where he\r\n      came to dwell.\r\n\r\n      But parish officers, it seems, were not always more honest with regard to\r\n      their own than they had been with regard to other parishes, and sometimes\r\n      connived at such intrusions, receiving the notice, and taking no proper\r\n      steps in consequence of it. As every person in a parish, therefore, was\r\n      supposed to have an interest to prevent as much as possible their being\r\n      burdened by such intruders, it was further enacted by the 3rd of William\r\n      III. that the forty days residence should be accounted only from the\r\n      publication of such notice in writing on Sunday in the church, immediately\r\n      after divine service.\r\n\r\n      “After all,” says Doctor Burn, “this kind of settlement, by continuing\r\n      forty days after publication of notice in writing, is very seldom\r\n      obtained; and the design of the acts is not so much for gaining of\r\n      settlements, as for the avoiding of them by persons coming into a parish\r\n      clandestinely, for the giving of notice is only putting a force upon the\r\n      parish to remove. But if a person’s situation is such, that it is doubtful\r\n      whether he is actually removable or not, he shall, by giving of notice,\r\n      compel the parish either to allow him a settlement uncontested, by\r\n      suffering him to continue forty days, or by removing him to try the\r\n      right.”\r\n\r\n      This statute, therefore, rendered it almost impracticable for a poor man\r\n      to gain a new settlement in the old way, by forty days inhabitancy. But\r\n      that it might not appear to preclude altogether the common people of one\r\n      parish from ever establishing themselves with security in another, it\r\n      appointed four other ways by which a settlement might be gained without\r\n      any notice delivered or published. The first was, by being taxed to parish\r\n      rates and paying them; the second, by being elected into an annual parish\r\n      office, and serving in it a year; the third, by serving an apprenticeship\r\n      in the parish; the fourth, by being hired into service there for a year,\r\n      and continuing in the same service during the whole of it. Nobody can gain\r\n      a settlement by either of the two first ways, but by the public deed of\r\n      the whole parish, who are too well aware of the consequences to adopt any\r\n      new-comer, who has nothing but his labour to support him, either by taxing\r\n      him to parish rates, or by electing him into a parish office.\r\n\r\n      No married man can well gain any settlement in either of the two last\r\n      ways. An apprentice is scarce ever married; and it is expressly enacted,\r\n      that no married servant shall gain any settlement by being hired for a\r\n      year. The principal effect of introducing settlement by service, has been\r\n      to put out in a great measure the old fashion of hiring for a year; which\r\n      before had been so customary in England, that even at this day, if no\r\n      particular term is agreed upon, the law intends that every servant is\r\n      hired for a year. But masters are not always willing to give their\r\n      servants a settlement by hiring them in this manner; and servants are not\r\n      always willing to be so hired, because, as every last settlement\r\n      discharges all the foregoing, they might thereby lose their original\r\n      settlement in the places of their nativity, the habitation of their\r\n      parents and relations.\r\n\r\n      No independent workman, it is evident, whether labourer or artificer, is\r\n      likely to gain any new settlement, either by apprenticeship or by service.\r\n      When such a person, therefore, carried his industry to a new parish, he\r\n      was liable to be removed, how healthy and industrious soever, at the\r\n      caprice of any churchwarden or overseer, unless he either rented a\r\n      tenement of ten pounds a-year, a thing impossible for one who has nothing\r\n      but his labour to live by, or could give such security for the discharge\r\n      of the parish as two justices of the peace should judge sufficient.\r\n\r\n      What security they shall require, indeed, is left altogether to their\r\n      discretion; but they cannot well require less than thirty pounds, it\r\n      having been enacted, that the purchase even of a freehold estate of less\r\n      than thirty pounds value, shall not gain any person a settlement, as not\r\n      being sufficient for the discharge of the parish. But this is a security\r\n      which scarce any man who lives by labour can give; and much greater\r\n      security is frequently demanded.\r\n\r\n      In order to restore, in some measure, that free circulation of labour\r\n      which those different statutes had almost entirely taken away, the\r\n      invention of certificates was fallen upon. By the 8th and 9th of William\r\n      III. it was enacted that if any person should bring a certificate from the\r\n      parish where he was last legally settled, subscribed by the church-wardens\r\n      and overseers of the poor, and allowed by two justices of the peace, that\r\n      every other parish should be obliged to receive him; that he should not be\r\n      removable merely upon account of his being likely to become chargeable,\r\n      but only upon his becoming actually chargeable; and that then the parish\r\n      which granted the certificate should be obliged to pay the expense both of\r\n      his maintenance and of his removal. And in order to give the most perfect\r\n      security to the parish where such certificated man should come to reside,\r\n      it was further enacted by the same statute, that he should gain no\r\n      settlement there by any means whatever, except either by renting a\r\n      tenement of ten pounds a-year, or by serving upon his own account in an\r\n      annual parish office for one whole year; and consequently neither by\r\n      notice nor by service, nor by apprenticeship, nor by paying parish rates.\r\n      By the 12th of Queen Anne, too, stat. 1, c.18, it was further enacted,\r\n      that neither the servants nor apprentices of such certificated man should\r\n      gain any settlement in the parish where he resided under such certificate.\r\n\r\n      How far this invention has restored that free circulation of labour, which\r\n      the preceding statutes had almost entirely taken away, we may learn from\r\n      the following very judicious observation of Doctor Burn. “It is obvious,”\r\n      says he, “that there are divers good reasons for requiring certificates\r\n      with persons coming to settle in any place; namely, that persons residing\r\n      under them can gain no settlement, neither by apprenticeship, nor by\r\n      service, nor by giving notice, nor by paying parish rates; that they can\r\n      settle neither apprentices nor servants; that if they become chargeable,\r\n      it is certainly known whither to remove them, and the parish shall be paid\r\n      for the removal, and for their maintenance in the mean time; and that, if\r\n      they fall sick, and cannot be removed, the parish which gave the\r\n      certificate must maintain them; none of all which can be without a\r\n      certificate. Which reasons will hold proportionably for parishes not\r\n      granting certificates in ordinary cases; for it is far more than an equal\r\n      chance, but that they will have the certificated persons again, and in a\r\n      worse condition.” The moral of this observation seems to be, that\r\n      certificates ought always to be required by the parish where any poor man\r\n      comes to reside, and that they ought very seldom to be granted by that\r\n      which he purposes to leave. “There is somewhat of hardship in this matter\r\n      of certificates,” says the same very intelligent author, in his History of\r\n      the Poor Laws, “by putting it in the power of a parish officer to imprison\r\n      a man as it were for life, however inconvenient it may be for him to\r\n      continue at that place where he has had the misfortune to acquire what is\r\n      called a settlement, or whatever advantage he may propose himself by\r\n      living elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n      Though a certificate carries along with it no testimonial of good\r\n      behaviour, and certifies nothing but that the person belongs to the parish\r\n      to which he really does belong, it is altogether discretionary in the\r\n      parish officers either to grant or to refuse it. A mandamus was once moved\r\n      for, says Doctor Burn, to compel the church-wardens and overseers to sign\r\n      a certificate; but the Court of King’s Bench rejected the motion as a very\r\n      strange attempt.\r\n\r\n      The very unequal price of labour which we frequently find in England, in\r\n      places at no great distance from one another, is probably owing to the\r\n      obstruction which the law of settlements gives to a poor man who would\r\n      carry his industry from one parish to another without a certificate. A\r\n      single man, indeed who is healthy and industrious, may sometimes reside by\r\n      sufferance without one; but a man with a wife and family who should\r\n      attempt to do so, would, in most parishes, be sure of being removed; and,\r\n      if the single man should afterwards marry, he would generally be removed\r\n      likewise. The scarcity of hands in one parish, therefore, cannot always be\r\n      relieved by their superabundance in another, as it is constantly in\r\n      Scotland, and I believe, in all other countries where there is no\r\n      difficulty of settlement. In such countries, though wages may sometimes\r\n      rise a little in the neighbourhood of a great town, or wherever else there\r\n      is an extraordinary demand for labour, and sink gradually as the distance\r\n      from such places increases, till they fall back to the common rate of the\r\n      country; yet we never meet with those sudden and unaccountable differences\r\n      in the wages of neighbouring places which we sometimes find in England,\r\n      where it is often more difficult for a poor man to pass the artificial\r\n      boundary of a parish, than an arm of the sea, or a ridge of high\r\n      mountains, natural boundaries which sometimes separate very distinctly\r\n      different rates of wages in other countries.\r\n\r\n      To remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour, from the parish where\r\n      he chooses to reside, is an evident violation of natural liberty and\r\n      justice. The common people of England, however, so jealous of their\r\n      liberty, but like the common people of most other countries, never rightly\r\n      understanding wherein it consists, have now, for more than a century\r\n      together, suffered themselves to be exposed to this oppression without a\r\n      remedy. Though men of reflection, too, have sometimes complained of the\r\n      law of settlements as a public grievance; yet it has never been the object\r\n      of any general popular clamour, such as that against general warrants, an\r\n      abusive practice undoubtedly, but such a one as was not likely to occasion\r\n      any general oppression. There is scarce a poor man in England, of forty\r\n      years of age, I will venture to say, who has not, in some part of his\r\n      life, felt himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill-contrived law of\r\n      settlements.\r\n\r\n      I shall conclude this long chapter with observing, that though anciently\r\n      it was usual to rate wages, first by general laws extending over the whole\r\n      kingdom, and afterwards by particular orders of the justices of peace in\r\n      every particular county, both these practices have now gone entirely into\r\n      disuse. “By the experience of above four hundred years,” says Doctor Burn,\r\n      “it seems time to lay aside all endeavours to bring under strict\r\n      regulations, what in its own nature seems incapable of minute limitation;\r\n      for if all persons in the same kind of work were to receive equal wages,\r\n      there would be no emulation, and no room left for industry or ingenuity.”\r\n\r\n      Particular acts of parliament, however, still attempt sometimes to\r\n      regulate wages in particular trades, and in particular places. Thus the\r\n      8th of George III. prohibits, under heavy penalties, all master tailors in\r\n      London, and five miles round it, from giving, and their workmen from\r\n      accepting, more than two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny a-day, except\r\n      in the case of a general mourning. Whenever the legislature attempts to\r\n      regulate the differences between masters and their workmen, its\r\n      counsellors are always the masters. When the regulation, therefore, is in\r\n      favour of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is\r\n      sometimes otherwise when in favour of the masters. Thus the law which\r\n      obliges the masters in several different trades to pay their workmen in\r\n      money, and not in goods, is quite just and equitable. It imposes no real\r\n      hardship upon the masters. It only obliges them to pay that value in\r\n      money, which they pretended to pay, but did not always really pay, in\r\n      goods. This law is in favour of the workmen; but the 8th of George III. is\r\n      in favour of the masters. When masters combine together, in order to\r\n      reduce the wages of their workmen, they commonly enter into a private bond\r\n      or agreement, not to give more than a certain wage, under a certain\r\n      penalty. Were the workmen to enter into a contrary combination of the same\r\n      kind, not to accept of a certain wage, under a certain penalty, the law\r\n      would punish them very severely; and, if it dealt impartially, it would\r\n      treat the masters in the same manner. But the 8th of George III. enforces\r\n      by law that very regulation which masters sometimes attempt to establish\r\n      by such combinations. The complaint of the workmen, that it puts the\r\n      ablest and most industrious upon the same footing with an ordinary\r\n      workman, seems perfectly well founded.\r\n\r\n      In ancient times, too, it was usual to attempt to regulate the profits of\r\n      merchants and other dealers, by regulating the price of provisions and\r\n      ether goods. The assize of bread is, so far as I know, the only remnant of\r\n      this ancient usage. Where there is an exclusive corporation, it may,\r\n      perhaps, be proper to regulate the price of the first necessary of life;\r\n      but, where there is none, the competition will regulate it much better\r\n      than any assize. The method of fixing the assize of bread, established by\r\n      the 31st of George II. could not be put in practice in Scotland, on\r\n      account of a defect in the law, its execution depending upon the office of\r\n      clerk of the market, which does not exist there. This defect was not\r\n      remedied till the third of George III. The want of an assize occasioned no\r\n      sensible inconveniency; and the establishment of one in the few places\r\n      where it has yet taken place has produced no sensible advantage. In the\r\n      greater part of the towns in Scotland, however, there is an incorporation\r\n      of bakers, who claim exclusive privileges, though they are not very\r\n      strictly guarded. The proportion between the different rates, both of\r\n      wages and profit, in the different employments of labour and stock, seems\r\n      not to be much affected, as has already been observed, by the riches or\r\n      poverty, the advancing, stationary, or declining state of the society.\r\n      Such revolutions in the public welfare, though they affect the general\r\n      rates both of wages and profit, must, in the end, affect them equally in\r\n      all different employments. The proportion between them, therefore, must\r\n      remain the same, and cannot well be altered, at least for any considerable\r\n      time, by any such revolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nOF THE RENT OF LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Rent, considered as the price paid for the use of land, is naturally the\r\n      highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of\r\n      the land. In adjusting the terms of the lease, the landlord endeavours to\r\n      leave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to keep\r\n      up the stock from which he furnishes the seed, pays the labour, and\r\n      purchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry,\r\n      together with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood.\r\n      This is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content\r\n      himself, without being a loser, and the landlord seldom means to leave him\r\n      any more. Whatever part of the produce, or, what is the same thing,\r\n      whatever part of its price, is over and above this share, he naturally\r\n      endeavours to reserve to himself as the rent of his land, which is\r\n      evidently the highest the tenant can afford to pay in the actual\r\n      circumstances of the land. Sometimes, indeed, the liberality, more\r\n      frequently the ignorance, of the landlord, makes him accept of somewhat\r\n      less than this portion; and sometimes, too, though more rarely, the\r\n      ignorance of the tenant makes him undertake to pay somewhat more, or to\r\n      content himself with somewhat less, than the ordinary profits of farming\r\n      stock in the neighbourhood. This portion, however, may still be considered\r\n      as the natural rent of land, or the rent at which it is naturally meant\r\n      that land should, for the most part, be let.\r\n\r\n      The rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a\r\n      reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon\r\n      its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some\r\n      occasions; for it can scarce ever be more than partly the case. The\r\n      landlord demands a rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed\r\n      interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an\r\n      addition to this original rent. Those improvements, besides, are not\r\n      always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the\r\n      tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly\r\n      demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his\r\n      own.\r\n\r\n      He sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human\r\n      improvements. Kelp is a species of sea-weed, which, when burnt, yields an\r\n      alkaline salt, useful for making glass, soap, and for several other\r\n      purposes. It grows in several parts of Great Britain, particularly in\r\n      Scotland, upon such rocks only as lie within the high-water mark, which\r\n      are twice every day covered with the sea, and of which the produce,\r\n      therefore, was never augmented by human industry. The landlord, however,\r\n      whose estate is bounded by a kelp shore of this kind, demands a rent for\r\n      it as much as for his corn-fields.\r\n\r\n      The sea in the neighbourhood of the islands of Shetland is more than\r\n      commonly abundant in fish, which makes a great part of the subsistence of\r\n      their inhabitants. But, in order to profit by the produce of the water,\r\n      they must have a habitation upon the neighbouring land. The rent of the\r\n      landlord is in proportion, not to what the farmer can make by the land,\r\n      but to what he can make both by the land and the water. It is partly paid\r\n      in sea-fish; and one of the very few instances in which rent makes a part\r\n      of the price of that commodity, is to be found in that country.\r\n\r\n      The rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of\r\n      the land, is naturally a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned to\r\n      what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land, or\r\n      to what he can afford to take, but to what the farmer can afford to give.\r\n\r\n      Such parts only of the produce of land can commonly be brought to market,\r\n      of which the ordinary price is sufficient to replace the stock which must\r\n      be employed in bringing them thither, together with its ordinary profits.\r\n      If the ordinary price is more than this, the surplus part of it will\r\n      naturally go to the rent of the land. If it is not more, though the\r\n      commodity may be brought to market, it can afford no rent to the landlord.\r\n      Whether the price is, or is not more, depends upon the demand.\r\n\r\n      There are some parts of the produce of land, for which the demand must\r\n      always be such as to afford a greater price than what is sufficient to\r\n      bring them to market; and there are others for which it either may or may\r\n      not be such as to afford this greater price. The former must always afford\r\n      a rent to the landlord. The latter sometimes may and sometimes may not,\r\n      according to different circumstances.\r\n\r\n      Rent, it is to be observed, therefore, enters into the composition of the\r\n      price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit. High or low\r\n      wages and profit are the causes of high or low price; high or low rent is\r\n      the effect of it. It is because high or low wages and profit must be paid,\r\n      in order to bring a particular commodity to market, that its price is high\r\n      or low. But it is because its price is high or low, a great deal more, or\r\n      very little more, or no more, than what is sufficient to pay those wages\r\n      and profit, that it affords a high rent, or a low rent, or no rent at all.\r\n\r\n      The particular consideration, first, of those parts of the produce of land\r\n      which always afford some rent; secondly, of those which sometimes may and\r\n      sometimes may not afford rent; and, thirdly, of the variations which, in\r\n      the different periods of improvement, naturally take place in the relative\r\n      value of those two different sorts of rude produce, when compared both\r\n      with one another and with manufactured commodities, will divide this\r\n      chapter into three parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART I.—Of the Produce of Land which always affords Rent.\r\n\r\n      As men, like all other animals, naturally multiply in proportion to the\r\n      means of their subsistence, food is always more or less in demand. It can\r\n      always purchase or command a greater or smaller quantity of labour, and\r\n      somebody can always be found who is willing to do something in order to\r\n      obtain it. The quantity of labour, indeed, which it can purchase, is not\r\n      always equal to what it could maintain, if managed in the most economical\r\n      manner, on account of the high wages which are sometimes given to labour;\r\n      but it can always purchase such a quantity of labour as it can maintain,\r\n      according to the rate at which that sort of labour is commonly maintained\r\n      in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n      But land, in almost any situation, produces a greater quantity of food\r\n      than what is sufficient to maintain all the labour necessary for bringing\r\n      it to market, in the most liberal way in which that labour is ever\r\n      maintained. The surplus, too, is always more than sufficient to replace\r\n      the stock which employed that labour, together with its profits.\r\n      Something, therefore, always remains for a rent to the landlord.\r\n\r\n      The most desert moors in Norway and Scotland produce some sort of pasture\r\n      for cattle, of which the milk and the increase are always more than\r\n      sufficient, not only to maintain all the labour necessary for tending\r\n      them, and to pay the ordinary profit to the farmer or the owner of the\r\n      herd or flock, but to afford some small rent to the landlord. The rent\r\n      increases in proportion to the goodness of the pasture. The same extent of\r\n      ground not only maintains a greater number of cattle, but as they are\r\n      brought within a smaller compass, less labour becomes requisite to tend\r\n      them, and to collect their produce. The landlord gains both ways; by the\r\n      increase of the produce, and by the diminution of the labour which must be\r\n      maintained out of it.\r\n\r\n      The rent of land not only varies with its fertility, whatever be its\r\n      produce, but with its situation, whatever be its fertility. Land in the\r\n      neighbourhood of a town gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in\r\n      a distant part of the country. Though it may cost no more labour to\r\n      cultivate the one than the other, it must always cost more to bring the\r\n      produce of the distant land to market. A greater quantity of labour,\r\n      therefore, must be maintained out of it; and the surplus, from which are\r\n      drawn both the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord, must be\r\n      diminished. But in remote parts of the country, the rate of profit, as has\r\n      already been shewn, is generally higher than in the neighbourhood of a\r\n      large town. A smaller proportion of this diminished surplus, therefore,\r\n      must belong to the landlord.\r\n\r\n      Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense of\r\n      carriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level\r\n      with those in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account\r\n      the greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the\r\n      remote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country.\r\n      They are advantageous to the town by breaking down the monopoly of the\r\n      country in its neighbourhood. They are advantageous even to that part of\r\n      the country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old\r\n      market, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly, besides, is a\r\n      great enemy to good management, which can never be universally\r\n      established, but in consequence of that free and universal competition\r\n      which forces every body to have recourse to it for the sake of self\r\n      defence. It is not more than fifty years ago, that some of the counties in\r\n      the neighbourhood of London petitioned the parliament against the\r\n      extension of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter\r\n      counties, they pretended, from the cheapness of labour, would be able to\r\n      sell their grass and corn cheaper in the London market than themselves,\r\n      and would thereby reduce their rents, and ruin their cultivation. Their\r\n      rents, however, have risen, and their cultivation has been improved since\r\n      that time.\r\n\r\n      A corn field of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity of\r\n      food for man, than the best pasture of equal extent. Though its\r\n      cultivation requires much more labour, yet the surplus which remains after\r\n      replacing the seed and maintaining all that labour, is likewise much\r\n      greater. If a pound of butcher’s meat, therefore, was never supposed to be\r\n      worth more than a pound of bread, this greater surplus would everywhere be\r\n      of greater value and constitute a greater fund, both for the profit of the\r\n      farmer and the rent of the landlord. It seems to have done so universally\r\n      in the rude beginnings of agriculture.\r\n\r\n      But the relative values of those two different species of food, bread and\r\n      butcher’s meat, are very different in the different periods of\r\n      agriculture. In its rude beginnings, the unimproved wilds, which then\r\n      occupy the far greater part of the country, are all abandoned to cattle.\r\n      There is more butcher’s meat than bread; and bread, therefore, is the food\r\n      for which there is the greatest competition, and which consequently brings\r\n      the greatest price. At Buenos Ayres, we are told by Ulloa, four reals,\r\n      one-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, was, forty or fifty years ago,\r\n      the ordinary price of an ox, chosen from a herd of two or three hundred.\r\n      He says nothing of the price of bread, probably because he found nothing\r\n      remarkable about it. An ox there, he says, costs little more than the\r\n      labour of catching him. But corn can nowhere be raised without a great\r\n      deal of labour; and in a country which lies upon the river Plate, at that\r\n      time the direct road from Europe to the silver mines of Potosi, the\r\n      money-price of labour could be very cheap. It is otherwise when\r\n      cultivation is extended over the greater part of the country. There is\r\n      then more bread than butcher’s meat. The competition changes its\r\n      direction, and the price of butcher’s meat becomes greater than the price\r\n      of bread.\r\n\r\n      By the extension, besides, of cultivation, the unimproved wilds become\r\n      insufficient to supply the demand for butcher’s meat. A great part of the\r\n      cultivated lands must be employed in rearing and fattening cattle; of\r\n      which the price, therefore, must be sufficient to pay, not only the labour\r\n      necessary for tending them, but the rent which the landlord, and the\r\n      profit which the farmer, could have drawn from such land employed in\r\n      tillage. The cattle bred upon the most uncultivated moors, when brought to\r\n      the same market, are, in proportion to their weight or goodness, sold at\r\n      the same price as those which are reared upon the most improved land. The\r\n      proprietors of those moors profit by it, and raise the rent of their land\r\n      in proportion to the price of their cattle. It is not more than a century\r\n      ago, that in many parts of the Highlands of Scotland, butcher’s meat was\r\n      as cheap or cheaper than even bread made of oatmeal. The Union opened the\r\n      market of England to the Highland cattle. Their ordinary price, at\r\n      present, is about three times greater than at the beginning of the\r\n      century, and the rents of many Highland estates have been tripled and\r\n      quadrupled in the same time. In almost every part of Great Britain, a\r\n      pound of the best butcher’s meat is, in the present times, generally worth\r\n      more than two pounds of the best white bread; and in plentiful years it is\r\n      sometimes worth three or four pounds.\r\n\r\n      It is thus that, in the progress of improvement, the rent and profit of\r\n      unimproved pasture come to be regulated in some measure by the rent and\r\n      profit of what is improved, and these again by the rent and profit of\r\n      corn. Corn is an annual crop; butcher’s meat, a crop which requires four\r\n      or five years to grow. As an acre of land, therefore, will produce a much\r\n      smaller quantity of the one species of food than of the other, the\r\n      inferiority of the quantity must be compensated by the superiority of the\r\n      price. If it was more than compensated, more corn-land would be turned\r\n      into pasture; and if it was not compensated, part of what was in pasture\r\n      would be brought back into corn.\r\n\r\n      This equality, however, between the rent and profit of grass and those of\r\n      corn; of the land of which the immediate produce is food for cattle, and\r\n      of that of which the immediate produce is food for men, must be understood\r\n      to take place only through the greater part of the improved lands of a\r\n      great country. In some particular local situations it is quite otherwise,\r\n      and the rent and profit of grass are much superior to what can be made by\r\n      corn.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in the neighbourhood of a great town, the demand for milk, and for\r\n      forage to horses, frequently contribute, together with the high price of\r\n      butcher’s meat, to raise the value of grass above what may be called its\r\n      natural proportion to that of corn. This local advantage, it is evident,\r\n      cannot be communicated to the lands at a distance.\r\n\r\n      Particular circumstances have sometimes rendered some countries so\r\n      populous, that the whole territory, like the lands in the neighbourhood of\r\n      a great town, has not been sufficient to produce both the grass and the\r\n      corn necessary for the subsistence of their inhabitants. Their lands,\r\n      therefore, have been principally employed in the production of grass, the\r\n      more bulky commodity, and which cannot be so easily brought from a great\r\n      distance; and corn, the food of the great body of the people, has been\r\n      chiefly imported from foreign countries. Holland is at present in this\r\n      situation; and a considerable part of ancient Italy seems to have been so\r\n      during the prosperity of the Romans. To feed well, old Cato said, as we\r\n      are told by Cicero, was the first and most profitable thing in the\r\n      management of a private estate; to feed tolerably well, the second; and to\r\n      feed ill, the third. To plough, he ranked only in the fourth place of\r\n      profit and advantage. Tillage, indeed, in that part of ancient Italy which\r\n      lay in the neighbour hood of Rome, must have been very much discouraged by\r\n      the distributions of corn which were frequently made to the people, either\r\n      gratuitously, or at a very low price. This corn was brought from the\r\n      conquered provinces, of which several, instead of taxes, were obliged to\r\n      furnish a tenth part of their produce at a stated price, about sixpence\r\n      a-peck, to the republic. The low price at which this corn was distributed\r\n      to the people, must necessarily have sunk the price of what could be\r\n      brought to the Roman market from Latium, or the ancient territory of Rome,\r\n      and must have discouraged its cultivation in that country.\r\n\r\n      In an open country, too, of which the principal produce is corn, a\r\n      well-inclosed piece of grass will frequently rent higher than any corn\r\n      field in its neighbourhood. It is convenient for the maintenance of the\r\n      cattle employed in the cultivation of the corn; and its high rent is, in\r\n      this case, not so properly paid from the value of its own produce, as from\r\n      that of the corn lands which are cultivated by means of it. It is likely\r\n      to fall, if ever the neighbouring lands are completely inclosed. The\r\n      present high rent of inclosed land in Scotland seems owing to the scarcity\r\n      of inclosure, and will probably last no longer than that scarcity. The\r\n      advantage of inclosure is greater for pasture than for corn. It saves the\r\n      labour of guarding the cattle, which feed better, too, when they are not\r\n      liable to be disturbed by their keeper or his dog.\r\n\r\n      But where there is no local advantage of this kind, the rent and profit of\r\n      corn, or whatever else is the common vegetable food of the people, must\r\n      naturally regulate upon the land which is fit for producing it, the rent\r\n      and profit of pasture.\r\n\r\n      The use of the artificial grasses, of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the\r\n      other expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quantity of\r\n      land feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural grass, should\r\n      somewhat reduce, it might be expected, the superiority which, in an\r\n      improved country, the price of butcher’s meat naturally has over that of\r\n      bread. It seems accordingly to have done so; and there is some reason for\r\n      believing that, at least in the London market, the price of butcher’s\r\n      meat, in proportion to the price of bread, is a good deal lower in the\r\n      present times than it was in the beginning of the last century.\r\n\r\n      In the Appendix to the life of Prince Henry, Doctor Birch has given us an\r\n      account of the prices of butcher’s meat as commonly paid by that prince.\r\n      It is there said, that the four quarters of an ox, weighing six hundred\r\n      pounds, usually cost him nine pounds ten shillings, or thereabouts; that\r\n      is thirty-one shillings and eight-pence per hundred pounds weight. Prince\r\n      Henry died on the 6th of November 1612, in the nineteenth year of his age.\r\n\r\n      In March 1764, there was a parliamentary inquiry into the causes of the\r\n      high price of provisions at that time. It was then, among other proof to\r\n      the same purpose, given in evidence by a Virginia merchant, that in March\r\n      1763, he had victualled his ships for twentyfour or twenty-five shillings\r\n      the hundred weight of beef, which he considered as the ordinary price;\r\n      whereas, in that dear year, he had paid twenty-seven shillings for the\r\n      same weight and sort. This high price in 1764 is, however, four shillings\r\n      and eight-pence cheaper than the ordinary price paid by Prince Henry; and\r\n      it is the best beef only, it must be observed, which is fit to be salted\r\n      for those distant voyages.\r\n\r\n      The price paid by Prince Henry amounts to 3d. ⅘ths per pound weight of\r\n      the whole carcase, coarse and choice pieces taken together; and at that\r\n      rate the choice pieces could not have been sold by retail for less than\r\n      4½d. or 5d. the pound.\r\n\r\n      In the parliamentary inquiry in 1764, the witnesses stated the price of\r\n      the choice pieces of the best beef to be to the consumer 4d. and 4½d. the\r\n      pound; and the coarse pieces in general to be from seven farthings to 2½d.\r\n      and 2¾d.; and this, they said, was in general one halfpenny dearer than\r\n      the same sort of pieces had usually been sold in the month of March. But\r\n      even this high price is still a good deal cheaper than what we can well\r\n      suppose the ordinary retail price to have been in the time of Prince\r\n      Henry.\r\n\r\n      During the first twelve years of the last century, the average price of\r\n      the best wheat at the Windsor market was £ 1:18:3½d. the quarter of nine\r\n      Winchester bushels.\r\n\r\n      But in the twelve years preceding 1764 including that year, the average\r\n      price of the same measure of the best wheat at the same market was £\r\n      2:1:9½d.\r\n\r\n      In the first twelve years of the last century, therefore, wheat appears to\r\n      have been a good deal cheaper, and butcher’s meat a good deal dearer, than\r\n      in the twelve years preceding 1764, including that year.\r\n\r\n      In all great countries, the greater part of the cultivated lands are\r\n      employed in producing either food for men or food for cattle. The rent and\r\n      profit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated land.\r\n      If any particular produce afforded less, the land would soon be turned\r\n      into corn or pasture; and if any afforded more, some part of the lands in\r\n      corn or pasture would soon be turned to that produce.\r\n\r\n      Those productions, indeed, which require either a greater original expense\r\n      of improvement, or a greater annual expense of cultivation in order to fit\r\n      the land for them, appear commonly to afford, the one a greater rent, the\r\n      other a greater profit, than corn or pasture. This superiority, however,\r\n      will seldom be found to amount to more than a reasonable interest or\r\n      compensation for this superior expense.\r\n\r\n      In a hop garden, a fruit garden, a kitchen garden, both the rent of the\r\n      landlord, and the profit of the farmer, are generally greater than in\r\n      acorn or grass field. But to bring the ground into this condition requires\r\n      more expense. Hence a greater rent becomes due to the landlord. It\r\n      requires, too, a more attentive and skilful management. Hence a greater\r\n      profit becomes due to the farmer. The crop, too, at least in the hop and\r\n      fruit garden, is more precarious. Its price, therefore, besides\r\n      compensating all occasional losses, must afford something like the profit\r\n      of insurance. The circumstances of gardeners, generally mean, and always\r\n      moderate, may satisfy us that their great ingenuity is not commonly\r\n      over-recompensed. Their delightful art is practised by so many rich people\r\n      for amusement, that little advantage is to be made by those who practise\r\n      it for profit; because the persons who should naturally be their best\r\n      customers, supply themselves with all their most precious productions.\r\n\r\n      The advantage which the landlord derives from such improvements, seems at\r\n      no time to have been greater than what was sufficient to compensate the\r\n      original expense of making them. In the ancient husbandry, after the\r\n      vineyard, a well-watered kitchen garden seems to have been the part of the\r\n      farm which was supposed to yield the most valuable produce. But\r\n      Democritus, who wrote upon husbandry about two thousand years ago, and who\r\n      was regarded by the ancients as one of the fathers of the art, thought\r\n      they did not act wisely who inclosed a kitchen garden. The profit, he\r\n      said, would not compensate the expense of a stone-wall: and bricks (he\r\n      meant, I suppose, bricks baked in the sun) mouldered with the rain and the\r\n      winter-storm, and required continual repairs. Columella, who reports this\r\n      judgment of Democritus, does not controvert it, but proposes a very frugal\r\n      method of inclosing with a hedge of brambles and briars, which he says he\r\n      had found by experience to be both a lasting and an impenetrable fence;\r\n      but which, it seems, was not commonly known in the time of Democritus.\r\n      Palladius adopts the opinion of Columella, which had before been\r\n      recommended by Varro. In the judgment of those ancient improvers, the\r\n      produce of a kitchen garden had, it seems, been little more than\r\n      sufficient to pay the extraordinary culture and the expense of watering;\r\n      for in countries so near the sun, it was thought proper, in those times as\r\n      in the present, to have the command of a stream of water, which could be\r\n      conducted to every bed in the garden. Through the greater part of Europe,\r\n      a kitchen garden is not at present supposed to deserve a better inclosure\r\n      than that recommended by Columella. In Great Britain, and some other\r\n      northern countries, the finer fruits cannot be brought to perfection but\r\n      by the assistance of a wall. Their price, therefore, in such countries,\r\n      must be sufficient to pay the expense of building and maintaining what\r\n      they cannot be had without. The fruit-wall frequently surrounds the\r\n      kitchen garden, which thus enjoys the benefit of an inclosure which its\r\n      own produce could seldom pay for.\r\n\r\n      That the vineyard, when properly planted and brought to perfection, was\r\n      the most valuable part of the farm, seems to have been an undoubted maxim\r\n      in the ancient agriculture, as it is in the modern, through all the wine\r\n      countries. But whether it was advantageous to plant a new vineyard, was a\r\n      matter of dispute among the ancient Italian husbandmen, as we learn from\r\n      Columella. He decides, like a true lover of all curious cultivation, in\r\n      favour of the vineyard; and endeavours to shew, by a comparison of the\r\n      profit and expense, that it was a most advantageous improvement. Such\r\n      comparisons, however, between the profit and expense of new projects are\r\n      commonly very fallacious; and in nothing more so than in agriculture. Had\r\n      the gain actually made by such plantations been commonly as great as he\r\n      imagined it might have been, there could have been no dispute about it.\r\n      The same point is frequently at this day a matter of controversy in the\r\n      wine countries. Their writers on agriculture, indeed, the lovers and\r\n      promoters of high cultivation, seem generally disposed to decide with\r\n      Columella in favour of the vineyard. In France, the anxiety of the\r\n      proprietors of the old vineyards to prevent the planting of any new ones,\r\n      seems to favour their opinion, and to indicate a consciousness in those\r\n      who must have the experience, that this species of cultivation is at\r\n      present in that country more profitable than any other. It seems, at the\r\n      same time, however, to indicate another opinion, that this superior profit\r\n      can last no longer than the laws which at present restrain the free\r\n      cultivation of the vine. In 1731, they obtained an order of council,\r\n      prohibiting both the planting of new vineyards, and the renewal of these\r\n      old ones, of which the cultivation had been interrupted for two years,\r\n      without a particular permission from the king, to be granted only in\r\n      consequence of an information from the intendant of the province,\r\n      certifying that he had examined the land, and that it was incapable of any\r\n      other culture. The pretence of this order was the scarcity of corn and\r\n      pasture, and the superabundance of wine. But had this superabundance been\r\n      real, it would, without any order of council, have effectually prevented\r\n      the plantation of new vineyards, by reducing the profits of this species\r\n      of cultivation below their natural proportion to those of corn and\r\n      pasture. With regard to the supposed scarcity of corn occasioned by the\r\n      multiplication of vineyards, corn is nowhere in France more carefully\r\n      cultivated than in the wine provinces, where the land is fit for producing\r\n      it: as in Burgundy, Guienne, and the Upper Languedoc. The numerous hands\r\n      employed in the one species of cultivation necessarily encourage the\r\n      other, by affording a ready market for its produce. To diminish the number\r\n      of those who are capable of paying it, is surely a most unpromising\r\n      expedient for encouraging the cultivation of corn. It is like the policy\r\n      which would promote agriculture, by discouraging manufactures.\r\n\r\n      The rent and profit of those productions, therefore, which require either\r\n      a greater original expense of improvement in order to fit the land for\r\n      them, or a greater annual expense of cultivation, though often much\r\n      superior to those of corn and pasture, yet when they do no more than\r\n      compensate such extraordinary expense, are in reality regulated by the\r\n      rent and profit of those common crops.\r\n\r\n      It sometimes happens, indeed, that the quantity of land which can be\r\n      fitted for some particular produce, is too small to supply the effectual\r\n      demand. The whole produce can be disposed of to those who are willing to\r\n      give somewhat more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent, wages,\r\n      and profit, necessary for raising and bringing it to market, according to\r\n      their natural rates, or according to the rates at which they are paid in\r\n      the greater part of other cultivated land. The surplus part of the price\r\n      which remains after defraying the whole expense of improvement and\r\n      cultivation, may commonly, in this case, and in this case only, bear no\r\n      regular proportion to the like surplus in corn or pasture, but may exceed\r\n      it in almost any degree; and the greater part of this excess naturally\r\n      goes to the rent of the landlord.\r\n\r\n      The usual and natural proportion, for example, between the rent and profit\r\n      of wine, and those of corn and pasture, must be understood to take place\r\n      only with regard to those vineyards which produce nothing but good common\r\n      wine, such as can be raised almost anywhere, upon any light, gravelly, or\r\n      sandy soil, and which has nothing to recommend it but its strength and\r\n      wholesomeness. It is with such vineyards only, that the common land of the\r\n      country can be brought into competition; for with those of a peculiar\r\n      quality it is evident that it cannot.\r\n\r\n      The vine is more affected by the difference of soils than any other\r\n      fruit-tree. From some it derives a flavour which no culture or management\r\n      can equal, it is supposed, upon any other. This flavour, real or\r\n      imaginary, is sometimes peculiar to the produce of a few vineyards;\r\n      sometimes it extends through the greater part of a small district, and\r\n      sometimes through a considerable part of a large province. The whole\r\n      quantity of such wines that is brought to market falls short of the\r\n      effectual demand, or the demand of those who would be willing to pay the\r\n      whole rent, profit, and wages, necessary for preparing and bringing them\r\n      thither, according to the ordinary rate, or according to the rate at which\r\n      they are paid in common vineyards. The whole quantity, therefore, can be\r\n      disposed of to those who are willing to pay more, which necessarily raises\r\n      their price above that of common wine. The difference is greater or less,\r\n      according as the fashionableness and scarcity of the wine render the\r\n      competition of the buyers more or less eager. Whatever it be, the greater\r\n      part of it goes to the rent of the landlord. For though such vineyards are\r\n      in general more carefully cultivated than most others, the high price of\r\n      the wine seems to be, not so much the effect, as the cause of this careful\r\n      cultivation. In so valuable a produce, the loss occasioned by negligence\r\n      is so great, as to force even the most careless to attention. A small part\r\n      of this high price, therefore, is sufficient to pay the wages of the\r\n      extraordinary labour bestowed upon their cultivation, and the profits of\r\n      the extraordinary stock which puts that labour into motion.\r\n\r\n      The sugar colonies possessed by the European nations in the West Indies\r\n      may be compared to those precious vineyards. Their whole produce falls\r\n      short of the effectual demand of Europe, and can be disposed of to those\r\n      who are willing to give more than what is sufficient to pay the whole\r\n      rent, profit, and wages, necessary for preparing and bringing it to\r\n      market, according to the rate at which they are commonly paid by any other\r\n      produce. In Cochin China, the finest white sugar generally sells for three\r\n      piastres the quintal, about thirteen shillings and sixpence of our money,\r\n      as we are told by Mr Poivre {Voyages d’un Philosophe.}, a very careful\r\n      observer of the agriculture of that country. What is there called the\r\n      quintal, weighs from a hundred and fifty to two hundred Paris pounds, or a\r\n      hundred and seventy-five Paris pounds at a medium, which reduces the price\r\n      of the hundred weight English to about eight shillings sterling; not a\r\n      fourth part of what is commonly paid for the brown or muscovada sugars\r\n      imported from our colonies, and not a sixth part of what is paid for the\r\n      finest white sugar. The greater part of the cultivated lands in Cochin\r\n      China are employed in producing corn and rice, the food of the great body\r\n      of the people. The respective prices of corn, rice, and sugar, are there\r\n      probably in the natural proportion, or in that which naturally takes place\r\n      in the different crops of the greater part of cultivated land, and which\r\n      recompenses the landlord and farmer, as nearly as can be computed,\r\n      according to what is usually the original expense of improvement, and the\r\n      annual expense of cultivation. But in our sugar colonies, the price of\r\n      sugar bears no such proportion to that of the produce of a rice or corn\r\n      field either in Europe or America. It is commonly said that a sugar\r\n      planter expects that the rum and the molasses should defray the whole\r\n      expense of his cultivation, and that his sugar should be all clear profit.\r\n      If this be true, for I pretend not to affirm it, it is as if a corn farmer\r\n      expected to defray the expense of his cultivation with the chaff and the\r\n      straw, and that the grain should be all clear profit. We see frequently\r\n      societies of merchants in London, and other trading towns, purchase waste\r\n      lands in our sugar colonies, which they expect to improve and cultivate\r\n      with profit, by means of factors and agents, notwithstanding the great\r\n      distance and the uncertain returns, from the defective administration of\r\n      justice in those countries. Nobody will attempt to improve and cultivate\r\n      in the same manner the most fertile lands of Scotland, Ireland, or the\r\n      corn provinces of North America, though, from the more exact\r\n      administration of justice in these countries, more regular returns might\r\n      be expected.\r\n\r\n      In Virginia and Maryland, the cultivation of tobacco is preferred, as most\r\n      profitable, to that of corn. Tobacco might be cultivated with advantage\r\n      through the greater part of Europe; but, in almost every part of Europe,\r\n      it has become a principal subject of taxation; and to collect a tax from\r\n      every different farm in the country where this plant might happen to be\r\n      cultivated, would be more difficult, it has been supposed, than to levy\r\n      one upon its importation at the custom-house. The cultivation of tobacco\r\n      has, upon this account, been most absurdly prohibited through the greater\r\n      part of Europe, which necessarily gives a sort of monopoly to the\r\n      countries where it is allowed; and as Virginia and Maryland produce the\r\n      greatest quantity of it, they share largely, though with some competitors,\r\n      in the advantage of this monopoly. The cultivation of tobacco, however,\r\n      seems not to be so advantageous as that of sugar. I have never even heard\r\n      of any tobacco plantation that was improved and cultivated by the capital\r\n      of merchants who resided in Great Britain; and our tobacco colonies send\r\n      us home no such wealthy planters as we see frequently arrive from our\r\n      sugar islands. Though, from the preference given in those colonies to the\r\n      cultivation of tobacco above that of corn, it would appear that the\r\n      effectual demand of Europe for tobacco is not completely supplied, it\r\n      probably is more nearly so than that for sugar; and though the present\r\n      price of tobacco is probably more than sufficient to pay the whole rent,\r\n      wages, and profit, necessary for preparing and bringing it to market,\r\n      according to the rate at which they are commonly paid in corn land, it\r\n      must not be so much more as the present price of sugar. Our tobacco\r\n      planters, accordingly, have shewn the same fear of the superabundance of\r\n      tobacco, which the proprietors of the old vineyards in France have of the\r\n      superabundance of wine. By act of assembly, they have restrained its\r\n      cultivation to six thousand plants, supposed to yield a thousand weight of\r\n      tobacco, for every negro between sixteen and sixty years of age. Such a\r\n      negro, over and above this quantity of tobacco, can manage, they reckon,\r\n      four acres of Indian corn. To prevent the market from being overstocked,\r\n      too, they have sometimes, in plentiful years, we are told by Dr Douglas\r\n      {Douglas’s Summary, vol. ii. p. 379, 373.} (I suspect he has been ill\r\n      informed), burnt a certain quantity of tobacco for every negro, in the\r\n      same manner as the Dutch are said to do of spices. If such violent methods\r\n      are necessary to keep up the present price of tobacco, the superior\r\n      advantage of its culture over that of corn, if it still has any, will not\r\n      probably be of long continuance.\r\n\r\n      It is in this manner that the rent of the cultivated land, of which the\r\n      produce is human food, regulates the rent of the greater part of other\r\n      cultivated land. No particular produce can long afford less, because the\r\n      land would immediately be turned to another use; and if any particular\r\n      produce commonly affords more, it is because the quantity of land which\r\n      can be fitted for it is too small to supply the effectual demand.\r\n\r\n      In Europe, corn is the principal produce of land, which serves immediately\r\n      for human food. Except in particular situations, therefore, the rent of\r\n      corn land regulates in Europe that of all other cultivated land. Britain\r\n      need envy neither the vineyards of France, nor the olive plantations of\r\n      Italy. Except in particular situations, the value of these is regulated by\r\n      that of corn, in which the fertility of Britain is not much inferior to\r\n      that of either of those two countries.\r\n\r\n      If, in any country, the common and favourite vegetable food of the people\r\n      should be drawn from a plant of which the most common land, with the same,\r\n      or nearly the same culture, produced a much greater quantity than the most\r\n      fertile does of corn; the rent of the landlord, or the surplus quantity of\r\n      food which would remain to him, after paying the labour, and replacing the\r\n      stock of the farmer, together with its ordinary profits, would necessarily\r\n      be much greater. Whatever was the rate at which labour was commonly\r\n      maintained in that country, this greater surplus could always maintain a\r\n      greater quantity of it, and, consequently, enable the landlord to purchase\r\n      or command a greater quantity of it. The real value of his rent, his real\r\n      power and authority, his command of the necessaries and conveniencies of\r\n      life with which the labour of other people could supply him, would\r\n      necessarily be much greater.\r\n\r\n      A rice field produces a much greater quantity of food than the most\r\n      fertile corn field. Two crops in the year, from thirty to sixty bushels\r\n      each, are said to be the ordinary produce of an acre. Though its\r\n      cultivation, therefore, requires more labour, a much greater surplus\r\n      remains after maintaining all that labour. In those rice countries,\r\n      therefore, where rice is the common and favourite vegetable food of the\r\n      people, and where the cultivators are chiefly maintained with it, a\r\n      greater share of this greater surplus should belong to the landlord than\r\n      in corn countries. In Carolina, where the planters, as in other British\r\n      colonies, are generally both farmers and landlords, and where rent,\r\n      consequently, is confounded with profit, the cultivation of rice is found\r\n      to be more profitable than that of corn, though their fields produce only\r\n      one crop in the year, and though, from the prevalence of the customs of\r\n      Europe, rice is not there the common and favourite vegetable food of the\r\n      people.\r\n\r\n      A good rice field is a bog at all seasons, and at one season a bog covered\r\n      with water. It is unfit either for corn, or pasture, or vineyard, or,\r\n      indeed, for any other vegetable produce that is very useful to men; and\r\n      the lands which are fit for those purposes are not fit for rice. Even in\r\n      the rice countries, therefore, the rent of rice lands cannot regulate the\r\n      rent of the other cultivated land which can never be turned to that\r\n      produce.\r\n\r\n      The food produced by a field of potatoes is not inferior in quantity to\r\n      that produced by a field of rice, and much superior to what is produced by\r\n      a field of wheat. Twelve thousand weight of potatoes from an acre of land\r\n      is not a greater produce than two thousand weight of wheat. The food or\r\n      solid nourishment, indeed, which can be drawn from each of those two\r\n      plants, is not altogether in proportion to their weight, on account of the\r\n      watery nature of potatoes. Allowing, however, half the weight of this root\r\n      to go to water, a very large allowance, such an acre of potatoes will\r\n      still produce six thousand weight of solid nourishment, three times the\r\n      quantity produced by the acre of wheat. An acre of potatoes is cultivated\r\n      with less expense than an acre of wheat; the fallow, which generally\r\n      precedes the sowing of wheat, more than compensating the hoeing and other\r\n      extraordinary culture which is always given to potatoes. Should this root\r\n      ever become in any part of Europe, like rice in some rice countries, the\r\n      common and favourite vegetable food of the people, so as to occupy the\r\n      same proportion of the lands in tillage, which wheat and other sorts of\r\n      grain for human food do at present, the same quantity of cultivated land\r\n      would maintain a much greater number of people; and the labourers being\r\n      generally fed with potatoes, a greater surplus would remain after\r\n      replacing all the stock, and maintaining all the labour employed in\r\n      cultivation. A greater share of this surplus, too, would belong to the\r\n      landlord. Population would increase, and rents would rise much beyond what\r\n      they are at present.\r\n\r\n      The land which is fit for potatoes, is fit for almost every other useful\r\n      vegetable. If they occupied the same proportion of cultivated land which\r\n      corn does at present, they would regulate, in the same manner, the rent of\r\n      the greater part of other cultivated land.\r\n\r\n      In some parts of Lancashire, it is pretended, I have been told, that bread\r\n      of oatmeal is a heartier food for labouring people than wheaten bread, and\r\n      I have frequently heard the same doctrine held in Scotland. I am, however,\r\n      somewhat doubtful of the truth of it. The common people in Scotland, who\r\n      are fed with oatmeal, are in general neither so strong nor so handsome as\r\n      the same rank of people in England, who are fed with wheaten bread. They\r\n      neither work so well, nor look so well; and as there is not the same\r\n      difference between the people of fashion in the two countries, experience\r\n      would seem to shew, that the food of the common people in Scotland is not\r\n      so suitable to the human constitution as that of their neighbours of the\r\n      same rank in England. But it seems to be otherwise with potatoes. The\r\n      chairmen, porters, and coal-heavers in London, and those unfortunate women\r\n      who live by prostitution, the strongest men and the most beautiful women\r\n      perhaps in the British dominions, are said to be, the greater part of\r\n      them, from the lowest rank of people in Ireland, who are generally fed\r\n      with this root. No food can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing\r\n      quality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human\r\n      constitution.\r\n\r\n      It is difficult to preserve potatoes through the year, and impossible to\r\n      store them like corn, for two or three years together. The fear of not\r\n      being able to sell them before they rot, discourages their cultivation,\r\n      and is, perhaps, the chief obstacle to their ever becoming in any great\r\n      country, like bread, the principal vegetable food of all the different\r\n      ranks of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART II.—Of the Produce of Land, which sometimes does, and sometimes\r\n      does not, afford Rent.\r\n\r\n      Human food seems to be the only produce of land, which always and\r\n      necessarily affords some rent to the landlord. Other sorts of produce\r\n      sometimes may, and sometimes may not, according to different\r\n      circumstances.\r\n\r\n      After food, clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind.\r\n\r\n      Land, in its original rude state, can afford the materials of clothing and\r\n      lodging to a much greater number of people than it can feed. In its\r\n      improved state, it can sometimes feed a greater number of people than it\r\n      can supply with those materials; at least in the way in which they require\r\n      them, and are willing to pay for them. In the one state, therefore, there\r\n      is always a superabundance of these materials, which are frequently, upon\r\n      that account, of little or no value. In the other, there is often a\r\n      scarcity, which necessarily augments their value. In the one state, a\r\n      great part of them is thrown away as useless and the price of what is used\r\n      is considered as equal only to the labour and expense of fitting it for\r\n      use, and can, therefore, afford no rent to the landlord. In the other,\r\n      they are all made use of, and there is frequently a demand for more than\r\n      can be had. Somebody is always willing to give more for every part of\r\n      them, than what is sufficient to pay the expense of bringing them to\r\n      market. Their price, therefore, can always afford some rent to the\r\n      landlord.\r\n\r\n      The skins of the larger animals were the original materials of clothing.\r\n      Among nations of hunters and shepherds, therefore, whose food consists\r\n      chiefly in the flesh of those animals, everyman, by providing himself with\r\n      food, provides himself with the materials of more clothing than he can\r\n      wear. If there was no foreign commerce, the greater part of them would be\r\n      thrown away as things of no value. This was probably the case among the\r\n      hunting nations of North America, before their country was discovered by\r\n      the Europeans, with whom they now exchange their surplus peltry, for\r\n      blankets, fire-arms, and brandy, which gives it some value. In the present\r\n      commercial state of the known world, the most barbarous nations, I\r\n      believe, among whom land property is established, have some foreign\r\n      commerce of this kind, and find among their wealthier neighbours such a\r\n      demand for all the materials of clothing, which their land produces, and\r\n      which can neither be wrought up nor consumed at home, as raises their\r\n      price above what it costs to send them to those wealthier neighbours. It\r\n      affords, therefore, some rent to the landlord. When the greater part of\r\n      the Highland cattle were consumed on their own hills, the exportation of\r\n      their hides made the most considerable article of the commerce of that\r\n      country, and what they were exchanged for afforded some addition to the\r\n      rent of the Highland estates. The wool of England, which in old times,\r\n      could neither be consumed nor wrought up at home, found a market in the\r\n      then wealthier and more industrious country of Flanders, and its price\r\n      afforded something to the rent of the land which produced it. In countries\r\n      not better cultivated than England was then, or than the Highlands of\r\n      Scotland are now, and which had no foreign commerce, the materials of\r\n      clothing would evidently be so superabundant, that a great part of them\r\n      would be thrown away as useless, and no part could afford any rent to the\r\n      landlord.\r\n\r\n      The materials of lodging cannot always be transported to so great a\r\n      distance as those of clothing, and do not so readily become an object of\r\n      foreign commerce. When they are superabundant in the country which\r\n      produces them, it frequently happens, even in the present commercial state\r\n      of the world, that they are of no value to the landlord. A good stone\r\n      quarry in the neighbourhood of London would afford a considerable rent. In\r\n      many parts of Scotland and Wales it affords none. Barren timber for\r\n      building is of great value in a populous and well-cultivated country, and\r\n      the land which produces it affords a considerable rent. But in many parts\r\n      of North America, the landlord would be much obliged to any body who would\r\n      carry away the greater part of his large trees. In some parts of the\r\n      Highlands of Scotland, the bark is the only part of the wood which, for\r\n      want of roads and water-carriage, can be sent to market; the timber is\r\n      left to rot upon the ground. When the materials of lodging are so\r\n      superabundant, the part made use of is worth only the labour and expense\r\n      of fitting it for that use. It affords no rent to the landlord, who\r\n      generally grants the use of it to whoever takes the trouble of asking it.\r\n      The demand of wealthier nations, however, sometimes enables him to get a\r\n      rent for it. The paving of the streets of London has enabled the owners of\r\n      some barren rocks on the coast of Scotland to draw a rent from what never\r\n      afforded any before. The woods of Norway, and of the coasts of the Baltic,\r\n      find a market in many parts of Great Britain, which they could not find at\r\n      home, and thereby afford some rent to their proprietors.\r\n\r\n      Countries are populous, not in proportion to the number of people whom\r\n      their produce can clothe and lodge, but in proportion to that of those\r\n      whom it can feed. When food is provided, it is easy to find the necessary\r\n      clothing and lodging. But though these are at hand, it may often be\r\n      difficult to find food. In some parts of the British dominions, what is\r\n      called a house may be built by one day’s labour of one man. The simplest\r\n      species of clothing, the skins of animals, require somewhat more labour to\r\n      dress and prepare them for use. They do not, however, require a great\r\n      deal. Among savage or barbarous nations, a hundredth, or little more than\r\n      a hundredth part of the labour of the whole year, will be sufficient to\r\n      provide them with such clothing and lodging as satisfy the greater part of\r\n      the people. All the other ninety-nine parts are frequently no more than\r\n      enough to provide them with food.\r\n\r\n      But when, by the improvement and cultivation of land, the labour of one\r\n      family can provide food for two, the labour of half the society becomes\r\n      sufficient to provide food for the whole. The other half, therefore, or at\r\n      least the greater part of them, can be employed in providing other things,\r\n      or in satisfying the other wants and fancies of mankind. Clothing and\r\n      lodging, household furniture, and what is called equipage, are the\r\n      principal objects of the greater part of those wants and fancies. The rich\r\n      man consumes no more food than his poor neighbour. In quality it may be\r\n      very different, and to select and prepare it may require more labour and\r\n      art; but in quantity it is very nearly the same. But compare the spacious\r\n      palace and great wardrobe of the one, with the hovel and the few rags of\r\n      the other, and you will be sensible that the difference between their\r\n      clothing, lodging, and household furniture, is almost as great in quantity\r\n      as it is in quality. The desire of food is limited in every man by the\r\n      narrow capacity of the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniencies\r\n      and ornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems\r\n      to have no limit or certain boundary. Those, therefore, who have the\r\n      command of more food than they themselves can consume, are always willing\r\n      to exchange the surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for\r\n      gratifications of this other kind. What is over and above satisfying the\r\n      limited desire, is given for the amusement of those desires which cannot\r\n      be satisfied, but seem to be altogether endless. The poor, in order to\r\n      obtain food, exert themselves to gratify those fancies of the rich; and to\r\n      obtain it more certainly, they vie with one another in the cheapness and\r\n      perfection of their work. The number of workmen increases with the\r\n      increasing quantity of food, or with the growing improvement and\r\n      cultivation of the lands; and as the nature of their business admits of\r\n      the utmost subdivisions of labour, the quantity of materials which they\r\n      can work up, increases in a much greater proportion than their numbers.\r\n      Hence arises a demand for every sort of material which human invention can\r\n      employ, either usefully or ornamentally, in building, dress, equipage, or\r\n      household furniture; for the fossils and minerals contained in the bowels\r\n      of the earth, the precious metals, and the precious stones.\r\n\r\n      Food is, in this manner, not only the original source of rent, but every\r\n      other part of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent, derives\r\n      that part of its value from the improvement of the powers of labour in\r\n      producing food, by means of the improvement and cultivation of land.\r\n\r\n      Those other parts of the produce of land, however, which afterwards afford\r\n      rent, do not afford it always. Even in improved and cultivated countries,\r\n      the demand for them is not always such as to afford a greater price than\r\n      what is sufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with its\r\n      ordinary profits, the stock which must be employed in bringing them to\r\n      market. Whether it is or is not such, depends upon different\r\n      circumstances.\r\n\r\n      Whether a coal mine, for example, can afford any rent, depends partly upon\r\n      its fertility, and partly upon its situation.\r\n\r\n      A mine of any kind may be said to be either fertile or barren, according\r\n      as the quantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain\r\n      quantity of labour, is greater or less than what can be brought by an\r\n      equal quantity from the greater part of other mines of the same kind.\r\n\r\n      Some coal mines, advantageously situated, cannot be wrought on account of\r\n      their barrenness. The produce does not pay the expense. They can afford\r\n      neither profit nor rent.\r\n\r\n      There are some, of which the produce is barely sufficient to pay the\r\n      labour, and replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock\r\n      employed in working them. They afford some profit to the undertaker of the\r\n      work, but no rent to the landlord. They can be wrought advantageously by\r\n      nobody but the landlord, who, being himself the undertaker of the work,\r\n      gets the ordinary profit of the capital which he employs in it. Many coal\r\n      mines in Scotland are wrought in this manner, and can be wrought in no\r\n      other. The landlord will allow nobody else to work them without paying\r\n      some rent, and nobody can afford to pay any.\r\n\r\n      Other coal mines in the same country, sufficiently fertile, cannot be\r\n      wrought on account of their situation. A quantity of mineral, sufficient\r\n      to defray the expense of working, could be brought from the mine by the\r\n      ordinary, or even less than the ordinary quantity of labour: but in an\r\n      inland country, thinly inhabited, and without either good roads or\r\n      water-carriage, this quantity could not be sold.\r\n\r\n      Coals are a less agreeable fuel than wood: they are said too to be less\r\n      wholesome. The expense of coals, therefore, at the place where they are\r\n      consumed, must generally be somewhat less than that of wood.\r\n\r\n      The price of wood, again, varies with the state of agriculture, nearly in\r\n      the same manner, and exactly for the same reason, as the price of cattle.\r\n      In its rude beginnings, the greater part of every country is covered with\r\n      wood, which is then a mere incumbrance, of no value to the landlord, who\r\n      would gladly give it to any body for the cutting. As agriculture advances,\r\n      the woods are partly cleared by the progress of tillage, and partly go to\r\n      decay in consequence of the increased number of cattle. These, though they\r\n      do not increase in the same proportion as corn, which is altogether the\r\n      acquisition of human industry, yet multiply under the care and protection\r\n      of men, who store up in the season of plenty what may maintain them in\r\n      that of scarcity; who, through the whole year, furnish them with a greater\r\n      quantity of food than uncultivated nature provides for them; and who, by\r\n      destroying and extirpating their enemies, secure them in the free\r\n      enjoyment of all that she provides. Numerous herds of cattle, when allowed\r\n      to wander through the woods, though they do not destroy the old trees,\r\n      hinder any young ones from coming up; so that, in the course of a century\r\n      or two, the whole forest goes to ruin. The scarcity of wood then raises\r\n      its price. It affords a good rent; and the landlord sometimes finds that\r\n      he can scarce employ his best lands more advantageously than in growing\r\n      barren timber, of which the greatness of the profit often compensates the\r\n      lateness of the returns. This seems, in the present times, to be nearly\r\n      the state of things in several parts of Great Britain, where the profit of\r\n      planting is found to be equal to that of either corn or pasture. The\r\n      advantage which the landlord derives from planting can nowhere exceed, at\r\n      least for any considerable time, the rent which these could afford him;\r\n      and in an inland country, which is highly cultivated, it will frequently\r\n      not fall much short of this rent. Upon the sea-coast of a well-improved\r\n      country, indeed, if coals can conveniently be had for fuel, it may\r\n      sometimes be cheaper to bring barren timber for building from less\r\n      cultivated foreign countries than to raise it at home. In the new town of\r\n      Edinburgh, built within these few years, there is not, perhaps, a single\r\n      stick of Scotch timber.\r\n\r\n      Whatever may be the price of wood, if that of coals is such that the\r\n      expense of a coal fire is nearly equal to that of a wood one we may be\r\n      assured, that at that place, and in these circumstances, the price of\r\n      coals is as high as it can be. It seems to be so in some of the inland\r\n      parts of England, particularly in Oxfordshire, where it is usual, even in\r\n      the fires of the common people, to mix coals and wood together, and where\r\n      the difference in the expense of those two sorts of fuel cannot,\r\n      therefore, be very great. Coals, in the coal countries, are everywhere\r\n      much below this highest price. If they were not, they could not bear the\r\n      expense of a distant carriage, either by land or by water. A small\r\n      quantity only could be sold; and the coal masters and the coal proprietors\r\n      find it more for their interest to sell a great quantity at a price\r\n      somewhat above the lowest, than a small quantity at the highest. The most\r\n      fertile coal mine, too, regulates the price of coals at all the other\r\n      mines in its neighbourhood. Both the proprietor and the undertaker of the\r\n      work find, the one that he can get a greater rent, the other that he can\r\n      get a greater profit, by somewhat underselling all their neighbours. Their\r\n      neighbours are soon obliged to sell at the same price, though they cannot\r\n      so well afford it, and though it always diminishes, and sometimes takes\r\n      away altogether, both their rent and their profit. Some works are\r\n      abandoned altogether; others can afford no rent, and can be wrought only\r\n      by the proprietor.\r\n\r\n      The lowest price at which coals can be sold for any considerable time, is,\r\n      like that of all other commodities, the price which is barely sufficient\r\n      to replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock which must be\r\n      employed in bringing them to market. At a coal mine for which the landlord\r\n      can get no rent, but, which he must either work himself or let it alone\r\n      altogether, the price of coals must generally be nearly about this price.\r\n\r\n      Rent, even where coals afford one, has generally a smaller share in their\r\n      price than in that of most other parts of the rude produce of land. The\r\n      rent of an estate above ground, commonly amounts to what is supposed to be\r\n      a third of the gross produce; and it is generally a rent certain and\r\n      independent of the occasional variations in the crop. In coal mines, a\r\n      fifth of the gross produce is a very great rent, a tenth the common rent;\r\n      and it is seldom a rent certain, but depends upon the occasional\r\n      variations in the produce. These are so great, that in a country where\r\n      thirty years purchase is considered as a moderate price for the property\r\n      of a landed estate, ten years purchase is regarded as a good price for\r\n      that of a coal mine.\r\n\r\n      The value of a coal mine to the proprietor, frequently depends as much\r\n      upon its situation as upon its fertility. That of a metallic mine depends\r\n      more upon its fertility, and less upon its situation. The coarse, and\r\n      still more the precious metals, when separated from the ore, are so\r\n      valuable, that they can generally bear the expense of a very long land,\r\n      and of the most distant sea carriage. Their market is not confined to the\r\n      countries in the neighbourhood of the mine, but extends to the whole\r\n      world. The copper of Japan makes an article of commerce in Europe; the\r\n      iron of Spain in that of Chili and Peru. The silver of Peru finds its way,\r\n      not only to Europe, but from Europe to China.\r\n\r\n      The price of coals in Westmoreland or Shropshire can have little effect on\r\n      their price at Newcastle; and their price in the Lionnois can have none at\r\n      all. The productions of such distant coal mines can never be brought into\r\n      competition with one another. But the productions of the most distant\r\n      metallic mines frequently may, and in fact commonly are.\r\n\r\n      The price, therefore, of the coarse, and still more that of the precious\r\n      metals, at the most fertile mines in the world, must necessarily more or\r\n      less affect their price at every other in it. The price of copper in Japan\r\n      must have some influence upon its price at the copper mines in Europe. The\r\n      price of silver in Peru, or the quantity either of labour or of other\r\n      goods which it will purchase there, must have some influence on its price,\r\n      not only at the silver mines of Europe, but at those of China. After the\r\n      discovery of the mines of Peru, the silver mines of Europe were, the\r\n      greater part of them, abandoned. The value of silver was so much reduced,\r\n      that their produce could no longer pay the expense of working them, or\r\n      replace, with a profit, the food, clothes, lodging, and other necessaries\r\n      which were consumed in that operation. This was the case, too, with the\r\n      mines of Cuba and St. Domingo, and even with the ancient mines of Peru,\r\n      after the discovery of those of Potosi. The price of every metal, at every\r\n      mine, therefore, being regulated in some measure by its price at the most\r\n      fertile mine in the world that is actually wrought, it can, at the greater\r\n      part of mines, do very little more than pay the expense of working, and\r\n      can seldom afford a very high rent to the landlord. Rent accordingly,\r\n      seems at the greater part of mines to have but a small share in the price\r\n      of the coarse, and a still smaller in that of the precious metals. Labour\r\n      and profit make up the greater part of both.\r\n\r\n      A sixth part of the gross produce may be reckoned the average rent of the\r\n      tin mines of Cornwall, the most fertile that are known in the world, as we\r\n      are told by the Rev. Mr Borlace, vice-warden of the stannaries. Some, he\r\n      says, afford more, and some do not afford so much. A sixth part of the\r\n      gross produce is the rent, too, of several very fertile lead mines in\r\n      Scotland.\r\n\r\n      In the silver mines of Peru, we are told by Frezier and Ulloa, the\r\n      proprietor frequently exacts no other acknowledgment from the undertaker\r\n      of the mine, but that he will grind the ore at his mill, paying him the\r\n      ordinary multure or price of grinding. Till 1736, indeed, the tax of the\r\n      king of Spain amounted to one fifth of the standard silver, which till\r\n      then might be considered as the real rent of the greater part of the\r\n      silver mines of Peru, the richest which have been known in the world. If\r\n      there had been no tax, this fifth would naturally have belonged to the\r\n      landlord, and many mines might have been wrought which could not then be\r\n      wrought, because they could not afford this tax. The tax of the duke of\r\n      Cornwall upon tin is supposed to amount to more than five per cent. or one\r\n      twentieth part of the value; and whatever may be his proportion, it would\r\n      naturally, too, belong to the proprietor of the mine, if tin was duty\r\n      free. But if you add one twentieth to one sixth, you will find that the\r\n      whole average rent of the tin mines of Cornwall, was to the whole average\r\n      rent of the silver mines of Peru, as thirteen to twelve. But the silver\r\n      mines of Peru are not now able to pay even this low rent; and the tax upon\r\n      silver was, in 1736, reduced from one fifth to one tenth. Even this tax\r\n      upon silver, too, gives more temptation to smuggling than the tax of one\r\n      twentieth upon tin; and smuggling must be much easier in the precious than\r\n      in the bulky commodity. The tax of the king of Spain, accordingly, is said\r\n      to be very ill paid, and that of the duke of Cornwall very well. Rent,\r\n      therefore, it is probable, makes a greater part of the price of tin at the\r\n      most fertile tin mines than it does of silver at the most fertile silver\r\n      mines in the world. After replacing the stock employed in working those\r\n      different mines, together with its ordinary profits, the residue which\r\n      remains to the proprietor is greater, it seems, in the coarse, than in the\r\n      precious metal.\r\n\r\n      Neither are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly very\r\n      great in Peru. The same most respectable and well-informed authors\r\n      acquaint us, that when any person undertakes to work a new mine in Peru,\r\n      he is universally looked upon as a man destined to bankruptcy and ruin,\r\n      and is upon that account shunned and avoided by every body. Mining, it\r\n      seems, is considered there in the same light as here, as a lottery, in\r\n      which the prizes do not compensate the blanks, though the greatness of\r\n      some tempts many adventurers to throw away their fortunes in such\r\n      unprosperous projects.\r\n\r\n      As the sovereign, however, derives a considerable part of his revenue from\r\n      the produce of silver mines, the law in Peru gives every possible\r\n      encouragement to the discovery and working of new ones. Whoever discovers\r\n      a new mine, is entitled to measure off two hundred and forty-six feet in\r\n      length, according to what he supposes to be the direction of the vein, and\r\n      half as much in breadth. He becomes proprietor of this portion of the\r\n      mine, and can work it without paving any acknowledgment to the landlord.\r\n      The interest of the duke of Cornwall has given occasion to a regulation\r\n      nearly of the same kind in that ancient dutchy. In waste and uninclosed\r\n      lands, any person who discovers a tin mine may mark out its limits to a\r\n      certain extent, which is called bounding a mine. The bounder becomes the\r\n      real proprietor of the mine, and may either work it himself, or give it in\r\n      lease to another, without the consent of the owner of the land, to whom,\r\n      however, a very small acknowledgment must be paid upon working it. In both\r\n      regulations, the sacred rights of private property are sacrificed to the\r\n      supposed interests of public revenue.\r\n\r\n      The same encouragement is given in Peru to the discovery and working of\r\n      new gold mines; and in gold the king’s tax amounts only to a twentieth\r\n      part of the standard rental. It was once a fifth, and afterwards a tenth,\r\n      as in silver; but it was found that the work could not bear even the\r\n      lowest of these two taxes. If it is rare, however, say the same authors,\r\n      Frezier and Ulloa, to find a person who has made his fortune by a silver,\r\n      it is still much rarer to find one who has done so by a gold mine. This\r\n      twentieth part seems to be the whole rent which is paid by the greater\r\n      part of the gold mines of Chili and Peru. Gold, too, is much more liable\r\n      to be smuggled than even silver; not only on account of the superior value\r\n      of the metal in proportion to its bulk, but on account of the peculiar way\r\n      in which nature produces it. Silver is very seldom found virgin, but, like\r\n      most other metals, is generally mineralized with some other body, from\r\n      which it is impossible to separate it in such quantities as will pay for\r\n      the expense, but by a very laborious and tedious operation, which cannot\r\n      well be carried on but in work-houses erected for the purpose, and,\r\n      therefore, exposed to the inspection of the king’s officers. Gold, on the\r\n      contrary, is almost always found virgin. It is sometimes found in pieces\r\n      of some bulk; and, even when mixed, in small and almost insensible\r\n      particles, with sand, earth, and other extraneous bodies, it can be\r\n      separated from them by a very short and simple operation, which can be\r\n      carried on in any private house by any body who is possessed of a small\r\n      quantity of mercury. If the king’s tax, therefore, is but ill paid upon\r\n      silver, it is likely to be much worse paid upon gold; and rent must make a\r\n      much smaller part of the price of gold than that of silver.\r\n\r\n      The lowest price at which the precious metals can be sold, or the smallest\r\n      quantity of other goods for which they can be exchanged, during any\r\n      considerable time, is regulated by the same principles which fix the\r\n      lowest ordinary price of all other goods. The stock which must commonly be\r\n      employed, the food, clothes, and lodging, which must commonly be consumed\r\n      in bringing them from the mine to the market, determine it. It must at\r\n      least be sufficient to replace that stock, with the ordinary profits.\r\n\r\n      Their highest price, however, seems not to be necessarily determined by\r\n      any thing but the actual scarcity or plenty of these metals themselves. It\r\n      is not determined by that of any other commodity, in the same manner as\r\n      the price of coals is by that of wood, beyond which no scarcity can ever\r\n      raise it. Increase the scarcity of gold to a certain degree, and the\r\n      smallest bit of it may become more precious than a diamond, and exchange\r\n      for a greater quantity of other goods.\r\n\r\n      The demand for those metals arises partly from their utility, and partly\r\n      from their beauty. If you except iron, they are more useful than, perhaps,\r\n      any other metal. As they are less liable to rust and impurity, they can\r\n      more easily be kept clean; and the utensils, either of the table or the\r\n      kitchen, are often, upon that account, more agreeable when made of them. A\r\n      silver boiler is more cleanly than a lead, copper, or tin one; and the\r\n      same quality would render a gold boiler still better than a silver one.\r\n      Their principal merit, however, arises from their beauty, which renders\r\n      them peculiarly fit for the ornaments of dress and furniture. No paint or\r\n      dye can give so splendid a colour as gilding. The merit of their beauty is\r\n      greatly enhanced by their scarcity. With the greater part of rich people,\r\n      the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches; which, in\r\n      their eye, is never so complete as when they appear to possess those\r\n      decisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but themselves. In\r\n      their eyes, the merit of an object, which is in any degree either useful\r\n      or beautiful, is greatly enhanced by its scarcity, or by the great labour\r\n      which it requires to collect any considerable quantity of it; a labour\r\n      which nobody can afford to pay but themselves. Such objects they are\r\n      willing to purchase at a higher price than things much more beautiful and\r\n      useful, but more common. These qualities of utility, beauty, and scarcity,\r\n      are the original foundation of the high price of those metals, or of the\r\n      great quantity of other goods for which they can everywhere be exchanged.\r\n      This value was antecedent to, and independent of their being employed as\r\n      coin, and was the quality which fitted them for that employment. That\r\n      employment, however, by occasioning a new demand, and by diminishing the\r\n      quantity which could be employed in any other way, may have afterwards\r\n      contributed to keep up or increase their value.\r\n\r\n      The demand for the precious stones arises altogether from their beauty.\r\n      They are of no use but as ornaments; and the merit of their beauty is\r\n      greatly enhanced by their scarcity, or by the difficulty and expense of\r\n      getting them from the mine. Wages and profit accordingly make up, upon\r\n      most occasions, almost the whole of the high price. Rent comes in but for\r\n      a very small share, frequently for no share; and the most fertile mines\r\n      only afford any considerable rent. When Tavernier, a jeweller, visited the\r\n      diamond mines of Golconda and Visiapour, he was informed that the\r\n      sovereign of the country, for whose benefit they were wrought, had ordered\r\n      all of them to be shut up except those which yielded the largest and\r\n      finest stones. The other, it seems, were to the proprietor not worth the\r\n      working.\r\n\r\n      As the prices, both of the precious metals and of the precious stones, is\r\n      regulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine in\r\n      it, the rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in\r\n      proportion, not to its absolute, but to what may be called its relative\r\n      fertility, or to its superiority over other mines of the same kind. If new\r\n      mines were discovered, as much superior to those of Potosi, as they were\r\n      superior to those of Europe, the value of silver might be so much degraded\r\n      as to render even the mines of Potosi not worth the working. Before the\r\n      discovery of the Spanish West Indies, the most fertile mines in Europe may\r\n      have afforded as great a rent to their proprietors as the richest mines in\r\n      Peru do at present. Though the quantity of silver was much less, it might\r\n      have exchanged for an equal quantity of other goods, and the proprietor’s\r\n      share might have enabled him to purchase or command an equal quantity\r\n      either of labour or of commodities.\r\n\r\n      The value, both of the produce and of the rent, the real revenue which\r\n      they afforded, both to the public and to the proprietor, might have been\r\n      the same.\r\n\r\n      The most abundant mines, either of the precious metals, or of the precious\r\n      stones, could add little to the wealth of the world. A produce, of which\r\n      the value is principally derived from its scarcity, is necessarily\r\n      degraded by its abundance. A service of plate, and the other frivolous\r\n      ornaments of dress and furniture, could be purchased for a smaller\r\n      quantity of commodities; and in this would consist the sole advantage\r\n      which the world could derive from that abundance.\r\n\r\n      It is otherwise in estates above ground. The value, both of their produce\r\n      and of their rent, is in proportion to their absolute, and not to their\r\n      relative fertility. The land which produces a certain quantity of food,\r\n      clothes, and lodging, can always feed, clothe, and lodge, a certain number\r\n      of people; and whatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it will\r\n      always give him a proportionable command of the labour of those people,\r\n      and of the commodities with which that labour can supply him. The value of\r\n      the most barren land is not diminished by the neighbourhood of the most\r\n      fertile. On the contrary, it is generally increased by it. The great\r\n      number of people maintained by the fertile lands afford a market to many\r\n      parts of the produce of the barren, which they could never have found\r\n      among those whom their own produce could maintain.\r\n\r\n      Whatever increases the fertility of land in producing food, increases not\r\n      only the value of the lands upon which the improvement is bestowed, but\r\n      contributes likewise to increase that of many other lands, by creating a\r\n      new demand for their produce. That abundance of food, of which, in\r\n      consequence of the improvement of land, many people have the disposal\r\n      beyond what they themselves can consume, is the great cause of the demand,\r\n      both for the precious metals and the precious stones, as well as for every\r\n      other conveniency and ornament of dress, lodging, household furniture, and\r\n      equipage. Food not only constitutes the principal part of the riches of\r\n      the world, but it is the abundance of food which gives the principal part\r\n      of their value to many other sorts of riches. The poor inhabitants of Cuba\r\n      and St. Domingo, when they were first discovered by the Spaniards, used to\r\n      wear little bits of gold as ornaments in their hair and other parts of\r\n      their dress. They seemed to value them as we would do any little pebbles\r\n      of somewhat more than ordinary beauty, and to consider them as just worth\r\n      the picking up, but not worth the refusing to any body who asked them,\r\n      They gave them to their new guests at the first request, without seeming\r\n      to think that they had made them any very valuable present. They were\r\n      astonished to observe the rage of the Spaniards to obtain them; and had no\r\n      notion that there could anywhere be a country in which many people had the\r\n      disposal of so great a superfluity of food; so scanty always among\r\n      themselves, that, for a very small quantity of those glittering baubles,\r\n      they would willingly give as much as might maintain a whole family for\r\n      many years. Could they have been made to understand this, the passion of\r\n      the Spaniards would not have surprised them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART III.—Of the variations in the Proportion between the respective\r\n      Values of that sort of Produce which always affords Rent, and of that\r\n      which sometimes does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent.\r\n\r\n      The increasing abundance of food, in consequence of the increasing\r\n      improvement and cultivation, must necessarily increase the demand for\r\n      every part of the produce of land which is not food, and which can be\r\n      applied either to use or to ornament. In the whole progress of\r\n      improvement, it might, therefore, be expected there should be only one\r\n      variation in the comparative values of those two different sorts of\r\n      produce. The value of that sort which sometimes does, and sometimes does\r\n      not afford rent, should constantly rise in proportion to that which always\r\n      affords some rent. As art and industry advance, the materials of clothing\r\n      and lodging, the useful fossils and materials of the earth, the precious\r\n      metals and the precious stones, should gradually come to be more and more\r\n      in demand, should gradually exchange for a greater and a greater quantity\r\n      of food; or, in other words, should gradually become dearer and dearer.\r\n      This, accordingly, has been the case with most of these things upon most\r\n      occasions, and would have been the case with all of them upon all\r\n      occasions, if particular accidents had not, upon some occasions, increased\r\n      the supply of some of them in a still greater proportion than the demand.\r\n\r\n      The value of a free-stone quarry, for example, will necessarily increase\r\n      with the increasing improvement and population of the country round about\r\n      it, especially if it should be the only one in the neighbourhood. But the\r\n      value of a silver mine, even though there should not be another within a\r\n      thousand miles of it, will not necessarily increase with the improvement\r\n      of the country in which it is situated. The market for the produce of a\r\n      free-stone quarry can seldom extend more than a few miles round about it,\r\n      and the demand must generally be in proportion to the improvement and\r\n      population of that small district; but the market for the produce of a\r\n      silver mine may extend over the whole known world. Unless the world in\r\n      general, therefore, be advancing in improvement and population, the demand\r\n      for silver might not be at all increased by the improvement even of a\r\n      large country in the neighbourhood of the mine. Even though the world in\r\n      general were improving, yet if, in the course of its improvements, new\r\n      mines should be discovered, much more fertile than any which had been\r\n      known before, though the demand for silver would necessarily increase, yet\r\n      the supply might increase in so much a greater proportion, that the real\r\n      price of that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given quantity, a\r\n      pound weight of it, for example, might gradually purchase or command a\r\n      smaller and a smaller quantity of labour, or exchange for a smaller and a\r\n      smaller quantity of corn, the principal part of the subsistence of the\r\n      labourer.\r\n\r\n      The great market for silver is the commercial and civilized part of the\r\n      world.\r\n\r\n      If, by the general progress of improvement, the demand of this market\r\n      should increase, while, at the same time, the supply did not increase in\r\n      the same proportion, the value of silver would gradually rise in\r\n      proportion to that of corn. Any given quantity of silver would exchange\r\n      for a greater and a greater quantity of corn; or, in other words, the\r\n      average money price of corn would gradually become cheaper and cheaper.\r\n\r\n      If, on the contrary, the supply, by some accident, should increase, for\r\n      many years together, in a greater proportion than the demand, that metal\r\n      would gradually become cheaper and cheaper; or, in other words, the\r\n      average money price of corn would, in spite of all improvements, gradually\r\n      become dearer and dearer.\r\n\r\n      But if, on the other hand, the supply of that metal should increase nearly\r\n      in the same proportion as the demand, it would continue to purchase or\r\n      exchange for nearly the same quantity of corn; and the average money price\r\n      of corn would, in spite of all improvements. continue very nearly the\r\n      same.\r\n\r\n      These three seem to exhaust all the possible combinations of events which\r\n      can happen in the progress of improvement; and during the course of the\r\n      four centuries preceding the present, if we may judge by what has happened\r\n      both in France and Great Britain, each of those three different\r\n      combinations seems to have taken place in the European market, and nearly\r\n      in the same order, too, in which I have here set them down.\r\n\r\n      _Digression concerning the Variations in the value of Silver during the\r\n      Course of the Four last Centuries._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      First Period.—In 1350, and for some time before, the average price\r\n      of the quarter of wheat in England seems not to have been estimated lower\r\n      than four ounces of silver, Tower weight, equal to about twenty shillings\r\n      of our present money. From this price it seems to have fallen gradually to\r\n      two ounces of silver, equal to about ten shillings of our present money,\r\n      the price at which we find it estimated in the beginning of the sixteenth\r\n      century, and at which it seems to have continued to be estimated till\r\n      about 1570.\r\n\r\n      In 1350, being the 25th of Edward III. was enacted what is called the\r\n      Statute of Labourers. In the preamble, it complains much of the insolence\r\n      of servants, who endeavoured to raise their wages upon their masters. It\r\n      therefore ordains, that all servants and labourers should, for the future,\r\n      be contented with the same wages and liveries (liveries in those times\r\n      signified not only clothes, but provisions) which they had been accustomed\r\n      to receive in the 20th year of the king, and the four preceding years;\r\n      that, upon this account, their livery-wheat should nowhere be estimated\r\n      higher than tenpence a-bushel, and that it should always be in the option\r\n      of the master to deliver them either the wheat or the money. Tenpence:\r\n      a-bushel, therefore, had, in the 25th of Edward III. been reckoned a very\r\n      moderate price of wheat, since it required a particular statute to oblige\r\n      servants to accept of it in exchange for their usual livery of provisions;\r\n      and it had been reckoned a reasonable price ten years before that, or in\r\n      the 16th year of the king, the term to which the statute refers. But in\r\n      the 16th year of Edward III. tenpence contained about half an ounce of\r\n      silver, Tower weight, and was nearly equal to half-a-crown of our present\r\n      money. Four ounces of silver, Tower weight, therefore, equal to six\r\n      shillings and eightpence of the money of those times, and to near twenty\r\n      shillings of that of the present, must have been reckoned a moderate price\r\n      for the quarter of eight bushels.\r\n\r\n      This statute is surely a better evidence of what was reckoned, in those\r\n      times, a moderate price of grain, than the prices of some particular\r\n      years, which have generally been recorded by historians and other writers,\r\n      on account of their extraordinary dearness or cheapness, and from which,\r\n      therefore, it is difficult to form any judgment concerning what may have\r\n      been the ordinary price. There are, besides, other reasons for believing\r\n      that, in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and for some time\r\n      before, the common price of wheat was not less than four ounces of silver\r\n      the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion.\r\n\r\n      In 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St Augustine’s, Canterbury, gave a feast\r\n      upon his installation-day, of which William Thorn has preserved, not only\r\n      the bill of fare, but the prices of many particulars. In that feast were\r\n      consumed, 1st, fifty-three quarters of wheat, which cost nineteen pounds,\r\n      or seven shillings, and twopence a-quarter, equal to about one-and-twenty\r\n      shillings and sixpence of our present money; 2dly, fifty-eight quarters of\r\n      malt, which cost seventeen pounds ten shillings, or six shillings\r\n      a-quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money; 3dly,\r\n      twenty quarters of oats, which cost four pounds, or four shillings\r\n      a-quarter, equal to about twelve shillings of our present money. The\r\n      prices of malt and oats seem here to be higher than their ordinary\r\n      proportion to the price of wheat.\r\n\r\n      These prices are not recorded, on account of their extraordinary dearness\r\n      or cheapness, but are mentioned accidentally, as the prices actually paid\r\n      for large quantities of grain consumed at a feast, which was famous for\r\n      its magnificence.\r\n\r\n      In 1262, being the 51st of Henry III. was revived an ancient statute,\r\n      called the assize of bread and ale, which, the king says in the preamble,\r\n      had been made in the times of his progenitors, some time kings of England.\r\n      It is probably, therefore, as old at least as the time of his grandfather,\r\n      Henry II. and may have been as old as the Conquest. It regulates the price\r\n      of bread according as the prices of wheat may happen to be, from one\r\n      shilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times. But\r\n      statutes of this kind are generally presumed to provide with equal care\r\n      for all deviations from the middle price, for those below it, as well as\r\n      for those above it. Ten shillings, therefore, containing six ounces of\r\n      silver, Tower weight, and equal to about thirty shillings of our present\r\n      money, must, upon this supposition, have been reckoned the middle price of\r\n      the quarter of wheat when this statute was first enacted, and must have\r\n      continued to be so in the 51st of Henry III. We cannot, therefore, be very\r\n      wrong in supposing that the middle price was not less than one-third of\r\n      the highest price at which this statute regulates the price of bread, or\r\n      than six shillings and eightpence of the money of those times, containing\r\n      four ounces of silver, Tower weight.\r\n\r\n      From these different facts, therefore, we seem to have some reason to\r\n      conclude that, about the middle of the fourteenth century, and for a\r\n      considerable time before, the average or ordinary price of the quarter of\r\n      wheat was not supposed to be less than four ounces of silver, Tower\r\n      weight.\r\n\r\n      From about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth\r\n      century, what was reckoned the reasonable and moderate, that is, the\r\n      ordinary or average price of wheat, seems to have sunk gradually to about\r\n      one half of this price; so as at last to have fallen to about two ounces\r\n      of silver, Tower weight, equal to about ten shillings of our present\r\n      money. It continued to be estimated at this price till about 1570.\r\n\r\n      In the household book of Henry, the fifth earl of Northumberland, drawn up\r\n      in 1512 there are two different estimations of wheat. In one of them it is\r\n      computed at six shilling and eightpence the quarter, in the other at five\r\n      shillings and eightpence only. In 1512, six shillings and eightpence\r\n      contained only two ounces of silver, Tower weight, and were equal to about\r\n      ten shillings of our present money.\r\n\r\n      From the 25th of Edward III. to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth,\r\n      during the space of more than two hundred years, six shillings and\r\n      eightpence, it appears from several different statutes, had continued to\r\n      be considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable, that is, the\r\n      ordinary or average price of wheat. The quantity of silver, however,\r\n      contained in that nominal sum was, during the course of this period,\r\n      continually diminishing in consequence of some alterations which were made\r\n      in the coin. But the increase of the value of silver had, it seems, so far\r\n      compensated the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the same\r\n      nominal sum, that the legislature did not think it worth while to attend\r\n      to this circumstance.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in 1436, it was enacted, that wheat might be exported without a\r\n      licence when the price was so low as six shillings and eightpence: and in\r\n      1463, it was enacted, that no wheat should be imported if the price was\r\n      not above six shillings and eightpence the quarter: The legislature had\r\n      imagined, that when the price was so low, there could be no inconveniency\r\n      in exportation, but that when it rose higher, it became prudent to allow\r\n      of importation. Six shillings and eightpence, therefore, containing about\r\n      the same quantity of silver as thirteen shillings and fourpence of our\r\n      present money (one-third part less than the same nominal sum contained in\r\n      the time of Edward III), had, in those times, been considered as what is\r\n      called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat.\r\n\r\n      In 1554, by the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary, and in 1558, by the 1st of\r\n      Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was in the same manner prohibited,\r\n      whenever the price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and\r\n      eightpence, which did not then contain two penny worth more silver than\r\n      the same nominal sum does at present. But it had soon been found, that to\r\n      restrain the exportation of wheat till the price was so very low, was, in\r\n      reality, to prohibit it altogether. In 1562, therefore, by the 5th of\r\n      Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was allowed from certain ports,\r\n      whenever the price of the quarter should not exceed ten shillings,\r\n      containing nearly the same quantity of silver as the like nominal sum does\r\n      at present. This price had at this time, therefore, been considered as\r\n      what is called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat. It agrees\r\n      nearly with the estimation of the Northumberland book in 1512.\r\n\r\n      That in France the average price of grain was, in the same manner, much\r\n      lower in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\n      than in the two centuries preceding, has been observed both by Mr Dupré de\r\n      St Maur, and by the elegant author of the Essay on the Policy of Grain.\r\n      Its price, during the same period, had probably sunk in the same manner\r\n      through the greater part of Europe.\r\n\r\n      This rise in the value of silver, in proportion to that of corn, may\r\n      either have been owing altogether to the increase of the demand for that\r\n      metal, in consequence of increasing improvement and cultivation, the\r\n      supply, in the mean time, continuing the same as before; or, the demand\r\n      continuing the same as before, it may have been owing altogether to the\r\n      gradual diminution of the supply: the greater part of the mines which were\r\n      then known in the world being much exhausted, and, consequently, the\r\n      expense of working them much increased; or it may have been owing partly\r\n      to the one, and partly to the other of those two circumstances. In the end\r\n      of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, the greater\r\n      part of Europe was approaching towards a more settled form of government\r\n      than it had enjoyed for several ages before. The increase of security\r\n      would naturally increase industry and improvement; and the demand for the\r\n      precious metals, as well as for every other luxury and ornament, would\r\n      naturally increase with the increase of riches. A greater annual produce\r\n      would require a greater quantity of coin to circulate it; and a greater\r\n      number of rich people would require a greater quantity of plate and other\r\n      ornaments of silver. It is natural to suppose, too, that the greater part\r\n      of the mines which then supplied the European market with silver might be\r\n      a good deal exhausted, and have become more expensive in the working. They\r\n      had been wrought, many of them, from the time of the Romans.\r\n\r\n      It has been the opinion, however, of the greater part of those who have\r\n      written upon the prices of commodities in ancient times, that, from the\r\n      Conquest, perhaps from the invasion of Julius Caesar, till the discovery\r\n      of the mines of America, the value of silver was continually diminishing.\r\n      This opinion they seem to have been led into, partly by the observations\r\n      which they had occasion to make upon the prices both of corn and of some\r\n      other parts of the rude produce of land, and partly by the popular notion,\r\n      that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country with\r\n      the increase of wealth, so its value diminishes as it quantity increases.\r\n\r\n      In their observations upon the prices of corn, three different\r\n      circumstances seem frequently to have misled them.\r\n\r\n      First, in ancient times, almost all rents were paid in kind; in a certain\r\n      quantity of corn, cattle, poultry, etc. It sometimes happened, however,\r\n      that the landlord would stipulate, that he should be at liberty to demand\r\n      of the tenant, either the annual payment in kind or a certain sum of money\r\n      instead of it. The price at which the payment in kind was in this manner\r\n      exchanged for a certain sum of money, is in Scotland called the conversion\r\n      price. As the option is always in the landlord to take either the\r\n      substance or the price, it is necessary, for the safety of the tenant,\r\n      that the conversion price should rather be below than above the average\r\n      market price. In many places, accordingly, it is not much above one half\r\n      of this price. Through the greater part of Scotland this custom still\r\n      continues with regard to poultry, and in some places with regard to\r\n      cattle. It might probably have continued to take place, too, with regard\r\n      to corn, had not the institution of the public fiars put an end to it.\r\n      These are annual valuations, according to the judgment of an assize, of\r\n      the average price of all the different sorts of grain, and of all the\r\n      different qualities of each, according to the actual market price in every\r\n      different county. This institution rendered it sufficiently safe for the\r\n      tenant, and much more convenient for the landlord, to convert, as they\r\n      call it, the corn rent, rather at what should happen to be the price of\r\n      the fiars of each year, than at any certain fixed price. But the writers\r\n      who have collected the prices of corn in ancient times seem frequently to\r\n      have mistaken what is called in Scotland the conversion price for the\r\n      actual market price. Fleetwood acknowledges, upon one occasion, that he\r\n      had made this mistake. As he wrote his book, however, for a particular\r\n      purpose, he does not think proper to make this acknowledgment till after\r\n      transcribing this conversion price fifteen times. The price is eight\r\n      shillings the quarter of wheat. This sum in 1423, the year at which he\r\n      begins with it, contained the same quantity of silver as sixteen shillings\r\n      of our present money. But in 1562, the year at which he ends with it, it\r\n      contained no more than the same nominal sum does at present.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, they have been misled by the slovenly manner in which some\r\n      ancient statutes of assize had been sometimes transcribed by lazy copiers,\r\n      and sometimes, perhaps, actually composed by the legislature.\r\n\r\n      The ancient statutes of assize seem to have begun always with determining\r\n      what ought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat and\r\n      barley were at the lowest; and to have proceeded gradually to determine\r\n      what it ought to be, according as the prices of those two sorts of grain\r\n      should gradually rise above this lowest price. But the transcribers of\r\n      those statutes seem frequently to have thought it sufficient to copy the\r\n      regulation as far as the three or four first and lowest prices; saving in\r\n      this manner their own labour, and judging, I suppose, that this was enough\r\n      to show what proportion ought to be observed in all higher prices.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in the assize of bread and ale, of the 51st of Henry III. the price\r\n      of bread was regulated according to the different prices of wheat, from\r\n      one shilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times.\r\n      But in the manuscripts from which all the different editions of the\r\n      statutes, preceding that of Mr Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had\r\n      never transcribed this regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings.\r\n      Several writers, therefore, being misled by this faulty transcription,\r\n      very naturally conclude that the middle price, or six shillings the\r\n      quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money, was the\r\n      ordinary or average price of wheat at that time.\r\n\r\n      In the statute of Tumbrel and Pillory, enacted nearly about the same time,\r\n      the price of ale is regulated according to every sixpence rise in the\r\n      price of barley, from two shillings, to four shillings the quarter. That\r\n      four shillings, however, was not considered as the highest price to which\r\n      barley might frequently rise in those times, and that these prices were\r\n      only given as an example of the proportion which ought to be observed in\r\n      all other prices, whether higher or lower, we may infer from the last\r\n      words of the statute: “Et sic deinceps crescetur vel diminuetur per sex\r\n      denarios.” The expression is very slovenly, but the meaning is plain\r\n      enough, “that the price of ale is in this manner to be increased or\r\n      diminished according to every sixpence rise or fall in the price of\r\n      barley.” In the composition of this statute, the legislature itself seems\r\n      to have been as negligent as the copiers were in the transcription of the\r\n      other.\r\n\r\n      In an ancient manuscript of the Regiam Majestatem, an old Scotch law book,\r\n      there is a statute of assize, in which the price of bread is regulated\r\n      according to all the different prices of wheat, from tenpence to three\r\n      shillings the Scotch boll, equal to about half an English quarter. Three\r\n      shillings Scotch, at the time when this assize is supposed to have been\r\n      enacted, were equal to about nine shillings sterling of our present money.\r\n      Mr Ruddiman seems {See his Preface to Anderson’s Diplomata Scotiae.} to\r\n      conclude from this, that three shillings was the highest price to which\r\n      wheat ever rose in those times, and that tenpence, a shilling, or at most\r\n      two shillings, were the ordinary prices. Upon consulting the manuscript,\r\n      however, it appears evidently, that all these prices are only set down as\r\n      examples of the proportion which ought to be observed between the\r\n      respective prices of wheat and bread. The last words of the statute are\r\n      “reliqua judicabis secundum praescripta, habendo respectum ad pretium\r\n      bladi.”—“You shall judge of the remaining cases, according to what\r\n      is above written, having respect to the price of corn.”\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, they seem to have been misled too, by the very low price at which\r\n      wheat was sometimes sold in very ancient times; and to have imagined, that\r\n      as its lowest price was then much lower than in later times its ordinary\r\n      price must likewise have been much lower. They might have found, however,\r\n      that in those ancient times its highest price was fully as much above, as\r\n      its lowest price was below any thing that had ever been known in later\r\n      times. Thus, in 1270, Fleetwood gives us two prices of the quarter of\r\n      wheat. The one is four pounds sixteen shillings of the money of those\r\n      times, equal to fourteen pounds eight shillings of that of the present;\r\n      the other is six pounds eight shillings, equal to nineteen pounds four\r\n      shillings of our present money. No price can be found in the end of the\r\n      fifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth century, which approaches to the\r\n      extravagance of these. The price of corn, though at all times liable to\r\n      variation varies most in those turbulent and disorderly societies, in\r\n      which the interruption of all commerce and communication hinders the\r\n      plenty of one part of the country from relieving the scarcity of another.\r\n      In the disorderly state of England under the Plantagenets, who governed it\r\n      from about the middle of the twelfth till towards the end of the fifteenth\r\n      century, one district might be in plenty, while another, at no great\r\n      distance, by having its crop destroyed, either by some accident of the\r\n      seasons, or by the incursion of some neighbouring baron, might be\r\n      suffering all the horrors of a famine; and yet if the lands of some\r\n      hostile lord were interposed between them, the one might not be able to\r\n      give the least assistance to the other. Under the vigorous administration\r\n      of the Tudors, who governed England during the latter part of the\r\n      fifteenth, and through the whole of the sixteenth century, no baron was\r\n      powerful enough to dare to disturb the public security.\r\n\r\n      The reader will find at the end of this chapter all the prices of wheat\r\n      which have been collected by Fleetwood, from 1202 to 1597, both inclusive,\r\n      reduced to the money of the present times, and digested, according to the\r\n      order of time, into seven divisions of twelve years each. At the end of\r\n      each division, too, he will find the average price of the twelve years of\r\n      which it consists. In that long period of time, Fleetwood has been able to\r\n      collect the prices of no more than eighty years; so that four years are\r\n      wanting to make out the last twelve years. I have added, therefore, from\r\n      the accounts of Eton college, the prices of 1598, 1599, 1600, and 1601. It\r\n      is the only addition which I have made. The reader will see, that from the\r\n      beginning of the thirteenth till after the middle of the sixteenth\r\n      century, the average price of each twelve years grows gradually lower and\r\n      lower; and that towards the end of the sixteenth century it begins to rise\r\n      again. The prices, indeed, which Fleetwood has been able to collect, seem\r\n      to have been those chiefly which were remarkable for extraordinary\r\n      dearness or cheapness; and I do not pretend that any very certain\r\n      conclusion can be drawn from them. So far, however, as they prove any\r\n      thing at all, they confirm the account which I have been endeavouring to\r\n      give. Fleetwood himself, however, seems, with most other writers, to have\r\n      believed, that, during all this period, the value of silver, in\r\n      consequence of its increasing abundance, was continually diminishing. The\r\n      prices of corn, which he himself has collected, certainly do not agree\r\n      with this opinion. They agree perfectly with that of Mr Dupré de St Maur,\r\n      and with that which I have been endeavouring to explain. Bishop Fleetwood\r\n      and Mr Dupré de St Maur are the two authors who seem to have collected,\r\n      with the greatest diligence and fidelity, the prices of things in ancient\r\n      times. It is somewhat curious that, though their opinions are so very\r\n      different, their facts, so far as they relate to the price of corn at\r\n      least, should coincide so very exactly.\r\n\r\n      It is not, however, so much from the low price of corn, as from that of\r\n      some other parts of the rude produce of land, that the most judicious\r\n      writers have inferred the great value of silver in those very ancient\r\n      times. Corn, it has been said, being a sort of manufacture, was, in those\r\n      rude ages, much dearer in proportion than the greater part of other\r\n      commodities; it is meant, I suppose, than the greater part of\r\n      unmanufactured commodities, such as cattle, poultry, game of all kinds,\r\n      etc. That in those times of poverty and barbarism these were\r\n      proportionably much cheaper than corn, is undoubtedly true. But this\r\n      cheapness was not the effect of the high value of silver, but of the low\r\n      value of those commodities. It was not because silver would in such times\r\n      purchase or represent a greater quantity of labour, but because such\r\n      commodities would purchase or represent a much smaller quantity than in\r\n      times of more opulence and improvement. Silver must certainly be cheaper\r\n      in Spanish America than in Europe; in the country where it is produced,\r\n      than in the country to which it is brought, at the expense of a long\r\n      carriage both by land and by sea, of a freight, and an insurance.\r\n      One-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, however, we are told by Ulloa,\r\n      was, not many years ago, at Buenos Ayres, the price of an ox chosen from a\r\n      herd of three or four hundred. Sixteen shillings sterling, we are told by\r\n      Mr Byron, was the price of a good horse in the capital of Chili. In a\r\n      country naturally fertile, but of which the far greater part is altogether\r\n      uncultivated, cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, etc. as they can be\r\n      acquired with a very small quantity of labour, so they will purchase or\r\n      command but a very small quantity. The low money price for which they may\r\n      be sold, is no proof that the real value of silver is there very high, but\r\n      that the real value of those commodities is very low.\r\n\r\n      Labour, it must always be remembered, and not any particular commodity, or\r\n      set of commodities, is the real measure of the value both of silver and of\r\n      all other commodities.\r\n\r\n      But in countries almost waste, or but thinly inhabited, cattle, poultry,\r\n      game of all kinds, etc. as they are the spontaneous productions of Nature,\r\n      so she frequently produces them in much greater quantities than the\r\n      consumption of the inhabitants requires. In such a state of things, the\r\n      supply commonly exceeds the demand. In different states of society, in\r\n      different states of improvement, therefore, such commodities will\r\n      represent, or be equivalent, to very different quantities of labour.\r\n\r\n      In every state of society, in every stage of improvement, corn is the\r\n      production of human industry. But the average produce of every sort of\r\n      industry is always suited, more or less exactly, to the average\r\n      consumption; the average supply to the average demand. In every different\r\n      stage of improvement, besides, the raising of equal quantities of corn in\r\n      the same soil and climate, will, at an average, require nearly equal\r\n      quantities of labour; or, what comes to the same thing, the price of\r\n      nearly equal quantities; the continual increase of the productive powers\r\n      of labour, in an improved state of cultivation, being more or less\r\n      counterbalanced by the continual increasing price of cattle, the principal\r\n      instruments of agriculture. Upon all these accounts, therefore, we may\r\n      rest assured, that equal quantities of corn will, in every state of\r\n      society, in every stage of improvement, more nearly represent, or be\r\n      equivalent to, equal quantities of labour, than equal quantities of any\r\n      other part of the rude produce of land. Corn, accordingly, it has already\r\n      been observed, is, in all the different stages of wealth and improvement,\r\n      a more accurate measure of value than any other commodity or set of\r\n      commodities. In all those different stages, therefore, we can judge better\r\n      of the real value of silver, by comparing it with corn, than by comparing\r\n      it with any other commodity or set of commodities.\r\n\r\n      Corn, besides, or whatever else is the common and favourite vegetable food\r\n      of the people, constitutes, in every civilized country, the principal part\r\n      of the subsistence of the labourer. In consequence of the extension of\r\n      agriculture, the land of every country produces a much greater quantity of\r\n      vegetable than of animal food, and the labourer everywhere lives chiefly\r\n      upon the wholesome food that is cheapest and most abundant. Butcher’s\r\n      meat, except in the most thriving countries, or where labour is most\r\n      highly rewarded, makes but an insignificant part of his subsistence;\r\n      poultry makes a still smaller part of it, and game no part of it. In\r\n      France, and even in Scotland, where labour is somewhat better rewarded\r\n      than in France, the labouring poor seldom eat butcher’s meat, except upon\r\n      holidays, and other extraordinary occasions. The money price of labour,\r\n      therefore, depends much more upon the average money price of corn, the\r\n      subsistence of the labourer, than upon that of butcher’s meat, or of any\r\n      other part of the rude produce of land. The real value of gold and silver,\r\n      therefore, the real quantity of labour which they can purchase or command,\r\n      depends much more upon the quantity of corn which they can purchase or\r\n      command, than upon that of butcher’s meat, or any other part of the rude\r\n      produce of land.\r\n\r\n      Such slight observations, however, upon the prices either of corn or of\r\n      other commodities, would not probably have misled so many intelligent\r\n      authors, had they not been influenced at the same time by the popular\r\n      notion, that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every\r\n      country with the increase of wealth, so its value diminishes as its\r\n      quantity increases. This notion, however, seems to be altogether\r\n      groundless.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of the precious metals may increase in any country from two\r\n      different causes; either, first, from the increased abundance of the mines\r\n      which supply it; or, secondly, from the increased wealth of the people,\r\n      from the increased produce of their annual labour. The first of these\r\n      causes is no doubt necessarily connected with the diminution of the value\r\n      of the precious metals; but the second is not.\r\n\r\n      When more abundant mines are discovered, a greater quantity of the\r\n      precious metals is brought to market; and the quantity of the necessaries\r\n      and conveniencies of life for which they must be exchanged being the same\r\n      as before, equal quantities of the metals must be exchanged for smaller\r\n      quantities of commodities. So far, therefore, as the increase of the\r\n      quantity of the precious metals in any country arises from the increased\r\n      abundance of the mines, it is necessarily connected with some diminution\r\n      of their value.\r\n\r\n      When, on the contrary, the wealth of any country increases, when the\r\n      annual produce of its labour becomes gradually greater and greater, a\r\n      greater quantity of coin becomes necessary in order to circulate a greater\r\n      quantity of commodities: and the people, as they can afford it, as they\r\n      have more commodities to give for it, will naturally purchase a greater\r\n      and a greater quantity of plate. The quantity of their coin will increase\r\n      from necessity; the quantity of their plate from vanity and ostentation,\r\n      or from the same reason that the quantity of fine statues, pictures, and\r\n      of every other luxury and curiosity, is likely to increase among them. But\r\n      as statuaries and painters are not likely to be worse rewarded in times of\r\n      wealth and prosperity, than in times of poverty and depression, so gold\r\n      and silver are not likely to be worse paid for.\r\n\r\n      The price of gold and silver, when the accidental discovery of more\r\n      abundant mines does not keep it down, as it naturally rises with the\r\n      wealth of every country, so, whatever be the state of the mines, it is at\r\n      all times naturally higher in a rich than in a poor country. Gold and\r\n      silver, like all other commodities, naturally seek the market where the\r\n      best price is given for them, and the best price is commonly given for\r\n      every thing in the country which can best afford it. Labour, it must be\r\n      remembered, is the ultimate price which is paid for every thing; and in\r\n      countries where labour is equally well rewarded, the money price of labour\r\n      will be in proportion to that of the subsistence of the labourer. But gold\r\n      and silver will naturally exchange for a greater quantity of subsistence\r\n      in a rich than in a poor country; in a country which abounds with\r\n      subsistence, than in one which is but indifferently supplied with it. If\r\n      the two countries are at a great distance, the difference may be very\r\n      great; because, though the metals naturally fly from the worse to the\r\n      better market, yet it may be difficult to transport them in such\r\n      quantities as to bring their price nearly to a level in both. If the\r\n      countries are near, the difference will be smaller, and may sometimes be\r\n      scarce perceptible; because in this case the transportation will be easy.\r\n      China is a much richer country than any part of Europe, and the difference\r\n      between the price of subsistence in China and in Europe is very great.\r\n      Rice in China is much cheaper than wheat is any where in Europe. England\r\n      is a much richer country than Scotland, but the difference between the\r\n      money price of corn in those two countries is much smaller, and is but\r\n      just perceptible. In proportion to the quantity or measure, Scotch corn\r\n      generally appears to be a good deal cheaper than English; but, in\r\n      proportion to its quality, it is certainly somewhat dearer. Scotland\r\n      receives almost every year very large supplies from England, and every\r\n      commodity must commonly be somewhat dearer in the country to which it is\r\n      brought than in that from which it comes. English corn, therefore, must be\r\n      dearer in Scotland than in England; and yet in proportion to its quality,\r\n      or to the quantity and goodness of the flour or meal which can be made\r\n      from it, it cannot commonly be sold higher there than the Scotch corn\r\n      which comes to market in competition with it.\r\n\r\n      The difference between the money price of labour in China and in Europe,\r\n      is still greater than that between the money price of subsistence; because\r\n      the real recompence of labour is higher in Europe than in China, the\r\n      greater part of Europe being in an improving state, while China seems to\r\n      be standing still. The money price of labour is lower in Scotland than in\r\n      England, because the real recompence of labour is much lower: Scotland,\r\n      though advancing to greater wealth, advances much more slowly than\r\n      England. The frequency of emigration from Scotland, and the rarity of it\r\n      from England, sufficiently prove that the demand for labour is very\r\n      different in the two countries. The proportion between the real recompence\r\n      of labour in different countries, it must be remembered, is naturally\r\n      regulated, not by their actual wealth or poverty, but by their advancing,\r\n      stationary, or declining condition.\r\n\r\n      Gold and silver, as they are naturally of the greatest value among the\r\n      richest, so they are naturally of the least value among the poorest\r\n      nations. Among savages, the poorest of all nations, they are scarce of any\r\n      value.\r\n\r\n      In great towns, corn is always dearer than in remote parts of the country.\r\n      This, however, is the effect, not of the real cheapness of silver, but of\r\n      the real dearness of corn. It does not cost less labour to bring silver to\r\n      the great town than to the remote parts of the country; but it costs a\r\n      great deal more to bring corn.\r\n\r\n      In some very rich and commercial countries, such as Holland and the\r\n      territory of Genoa, corn is dear for the same reason that it is dear in\r\n      great towns. They do not produce enough to maintain their inhabitants.\r\n      They are rich in the industry and skill of their artificers and\r\n      manufacturers, in every sort of machinery which can facilitate and abridge\r\n      labour; in shipping, and in all the other instruments and means of\r\n      carriage and commerce: but they are poor in corn, which, as it must be\r\n      brought to them from distant countries, must, by an addition to its price,\r\n      pay for the carriage from those countries. It does not cost less labour to\r\n      bring silver to Amsterdam than to Dantzic; but it costs a great deal more\r\n      to bring corn. The real cost of silver must be nearly the same in both\r\n      places; but that of corn must be very different. Diminish the real\r\n      opulence either of Holland or of the territory of Genoa, while the number\r\n      of their inhabitants remains the same; diminish their power of supplying\r\n      themselves from distant countries; and the price of corn, instead of\r\n      sinking with that diminution in the quantity of their silver, which must\r\n      necessarily accompany this declension, either as its cause or as its\r\n      effect, will rise to the price of a famine. When we are in want of\r\n      necessaries, we must part with all superfluities, of which the value, as\r\n      it rises in times of opulence and prosperity, so it sinks in times of\r\n      poverty and distress. It is otherwise with necessaries. Their real price,\r\n      the quantity of labour which they can purchase or command, rises in times\r\n      of poverty and distress, and sinks in times of opulence and prosperity,\r\n      which are always times of great abundance; for they could not otherwise be\r\n      times of opulence and prosperity. Corn is a necessary, silver is only a\r\n      superfluity.\r\n\r\n      Whatever, therefore, may have been the increase in the quantity of the\r\n      precious metals, which, during the period between the middle of the\r\n      fourteenth and that of the sixteenth century, arose from the increase of\r\n      wealth and improvement, it could have no tendency to diminish their value,\r\n      either in Great Britain, or in my other part of Europe. If those who have\r\n      collected the prices of things in ancient times, therefore, had, during\r\n      this period, no reason to infer the diminution of the value of silver from\r\n      any observations which they had made upon the prices either of corn, or of\r\n      other commodities, they had still less reason to infer it from any\r\n      supposed increase of wealth and improvement.\r\n\r\n      Second Period.—But how various soever may have been the opinions of\r\n      the learned concerning the progress of the value of silver during the\r\n      first period, they are unanimous concerning it during the second.\r\n\r\n      From about 1570 to about 1640, during a period of about seventy years, the\r\n      variation in the proportion between the value of silver and that of corn\r\n      held a quite opposite course. Silver sunk in its real value, or would\r\n      exchange for a smaller quantity of labour than before; and corn rose in\r\n      its nominal price, and, instead of being commonly sold for about two\r\n      ounces of silver the quarter, or about ten shillings of our present money,\r\n      came to be sold for six and eight ounces of silver the quarter, or about\r\n      thirty and forty shillings of our present money.\r\n\r\n      The discovery of the abundant mines of America seems to have been the sole\r\n      cause of this diminution in the value of silver, in proportion to that of\r\n      corn. It is accounted for, accordingly, in the same manner by every body;\r\n      and there never has been any dispute, either about the fact, or about the\r\n      cause of it. The greater part of Europe was, during this period, advancing\r\n      in industry and improvement, and the demand for silver must consequently\r\n      have been increasing; but the increase of the supply had, it seems, so far\r\n      exceeded that of the demand, that the value of that metal sunk\r\n      considerably. The discovery of the mines of America, it is to be observed,\r\n      does not seem to have had any very sensible effect upon the prices of\r\n      things in England till after 1570; though even the mines of Potosi had\r\n      been discovered more than twenty years before.\r\n\r\n      From 1595 to 1620, both inclusive, the average price of the quarter of\r\n      nine bushels of the best wheat, at Windsor market, appears, from the\r\n      accounts of Eton college, to have been £ 2:1:6 ⁹⁄₁₃. From which sum,\r\n      neglecting the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or 4s. 7 ⅓d., the price\r\n      of the quarter of eight bushels comes out to have been £ 1:16:10 ⅔. And\r\n      from this sum, neglecting likewise the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or\r\n      4s. 1 ⅑d., for the difference between the price of the best wheat and\r\n      that of the middle wheat, the price of the middle wheat comes out to have\r\n      been about £ 1:12:8 ⁸⁄₉, or about six ounces and one-third of an ounce of\r\n      silver.\r\n\r\n      From 1621 to 1636, both inclusive, the average price of the same measure\r\n      of the best wheat, at the same market, appears, from the same accounts, to\r\n      have been £ 2:10s.; from which, making the like deductions as in the\r\n      foregoing case, the average price of the quarter of eight bushels of\r\n      middle wheat comes out to have been £ 1:19:6, or about seven ounces and\r\n      two-thirds of an ounce of silver.\r\n\r\n      Third Period.—Between 1630 and 1640, or about 1636, the effect of\r\n      the discovery of the mines of America, in reducing the value of silver,\r\n      appears to have been completed, and the value of that metal seems never to\r\n      have sunk lower in proportion to that of corn than it was about that time.\r\n      It seems to have risen somewhat in the course of the present century, and\r\n      it had probably begun to do so, even some time before the end of the last.\r\n\r\n      From 1637 to 1700, both inclusive, being the sixty-four last years of the\r\n      last century the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best\r\n      wheat, at Windsor market, appears, from the same accounts, to have been £\r\n      2:11:0 ⅓, which is only 1s. 0 ⅓d. dearer than it had been during the\r\n      sixteen years before. But, in the course of these sixty-four years, there\r\n      happened two events, which must have produced a much greater scarcity of\r\n      corn than what the course of the seasons would otherwise have occasioned,\r\n      and which, therefore, without supposing any further reduction in the\r\n      value of silver, will much more than account for this very small\r\n      enhancement of price.\r\n\r\n      The first of these events was the civil war, which, by discouraging\r\n      tillage and interrupting commerce, must have raised the price of corn much\r\n      above what the course of the seasons would otherwise have occasioned. It\r\n      must have had this effect, more or less, at all the different markets in\r\n      the kingdom, but particularly at those in the neighbourhood of London,\r\n      which require to be supplied from the greatest distance. In 1648,\r\n      accordingly, the price of the best wheat, at Windsor market, appears, from\r\n      the same accounts, to have been £ 4:5s., and, in 1649, to have been £ 4,\r\n      the quarter of nine bushels. The excess of those two years above £ 2:10s.\r\n      (the average price of the sixteen years preceding 1637) is £ 3:5s., which,\r\n      divided among the sixty four last years of the last century, will alone\r\n      very nearly account for that small enhancement of price which seems to\r\n      have taken place in them. These, however, though the highest, are by no\r\n      means the only high prices which seem to have been occasioned by the civil\r\n      wars.\r\n\r\n      The second event was the bounty upon the exportation of corn, granted in\r\n      1688. The bounty, it has been thought by many people, by encouraging\r\n      tillage, may, in a long course of years, have occasioned a greater\r\n      abundance, and, consequently, a greater cheapness of corn in the home\r\n      market, than what would otherwise have taken place there. How far the\r\n      bounty could produce this effect at any time I shall examine hereafter: I\r\n      shall only observe at present, that between 1688 and 1700, it had not time\r\n      to produce any such effect. During this short period, its only effect must\r\n      have been, by encouraging the exportation of the surplus produce of every\r\n      year, and thereby hindering the abundance of one year from compensating\r\n      the scarcity of another, to raise the price in the home market. The\r\n      scarcity which prevailed in England, from 1693 to 1699, both inclusive,\r\n      though no doubt principally owing to the badness of the seasons, and,\r\n      therefore, extending through a considerable part of Europe, must have been\r\n      somewhat enhanced by the bounty. In 1699, accordingly, the further\r\n      exportation of corn was prohibited for nine months.\r\n\r\n      There was a third event which occurred in the course of the same period,\r\n      and which, though it could not occasion any scarcity of corn, nor,\r\n      perhaps, any augmentation in the real quantity of silver which was usually\r\n      paid for it, must necessarily have occasioned some augmentation in the\r\n      nominal sum. This event was the great debasement of the silver coin, by\r\n      clipping and wearing. This evil had begun in the reign of Charles II. and\r\n      had gone on continually increasing till 1695; at which time, as we may\r\n      learn from Mr Lowndes, the current silver coin was, at an average, near\r\n      five-and-twenty per cent. below its standard value. But the nominal sum\r\n      which constitutes the market price of every commodity is necessarily\r\n      regulated, not so much by the quantity of silver, which, according to the\r\n      standard, ought to be contained in it, as by that which, it is found by\r\n      experience, actually is contained in it. This nominal sum, therefore, is\r\n      necessarily higher when the coin is much debased by clipping and wearing,\r\n      than when near to its standard value.\r\n\r\n      In the course of the present century, the silver coin has not at any time\r\n      been more below its standard weight than it is at present. But though very\r\n      much defaced, its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin, for\r\n      which it is exchanged. For though, before the late recoinage, the gold\r\n      coin was a good deal defaced too, it was less so than the silver. In 1695,\r\n      on the contrary, the value of the silver coin was not kept up by the gold\r\n      coin; a guinea then commonly exchanging for thirty shillings of the worn\r\n      and clipt silver. Before the late recoinage of the gold, the price of\r\n      silver bullion was seldom higher than five shillings and sevenpence an\r\n      ounce, which is but fivepence above the mint price. But in 1695, the\r\n      common price of silver bullion was six shillings and fivepence an ounce,\r\n      {Lowndes’s Essay on the Silver Coin, 68.} which is fifteen pence above the\r\n      mint price. Even before the late recoinage of the gold, therefore, the\r\n      coin, gold and silver together, when compared with silver bullion, was not\r\n      supposed to be more than eight per cent. below its standard value, In\r\n      1695, on the contrary, it had been supposed to be near five-and-twenty per\r\n      cent. below that value. But in the beginning of the present century, that\r\n      is, immediately after the great recoinage in King William’s time, the\r\n      greater part of the current silver coin must have been still nearer to its\r\n      standard weight than it is at present. In the course of the present\r\n      century, too, there has been no great public calamity, such as a civil\r\n      war, which could either discourage tillage, or interrupt the interior\r\n      commerce of the country. And though the bounty which has taken place\r\n      through the greater part of this century, must always raise the price of\r\n      corn somewhat higher than it otherwise would be in the actual state of\r\n      tillage; yet, as in the course of this century, the bounty has had full\r\n      time to produce all the good effects commonly imputed to it to encourage\r\n      tillage, and thereby to increase the quantity of corn in the home market,\r\n      it may, upon the principles of a system which I shall explain and examine\r\n      hereafter, be supposed to have done something to lower the price of that\r\n      commodity the one way, as well as to raise it the other. It is by many\r\n      people supposed to have done more. In the sixty-four years of the present\r\n      century, accordingly, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of\r\n      the best wheat, at Windsor market, appears, by the accounts of Eton\r\n      college, to have been £ 2:0:6 ¹⁰⁄₃₂, which is about ten shillings and\r\n      sixpence, or more than five-and-twenty percent. cheaper than it had been\r\n      during the sixty-four last years of the last century; and about nine\r\n      shillings and sixpence cheaper than it had been during the sixteen years\r\n      preceding 1636, when the discovery of the abundant mines of America may be\r\n      supposed to have produced its full effect; and about one shilling cheaper\r\n      than it had been in the twenty-six years preceding 1620, before that\r\n      discovery can well be supposed to have produced its full effect. According\r\n      to this account, the average price of middle wheat, during these\r\n      sixty-four first years of the present century, comes out to have been\r\n      about thirty-two shillings the quarter of eight bushels.\r\n\r\n      The value of silver, therefore, seems to have risen somewhat in proportion\r\n      to that of corn during the course of the present century, and it had\r\n      probably begun to do so even some time before the end of the last.\r\n\r\n      In 1687, the price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat, at\r\n      Windsor market, was £ 1:5:2, the lowest price at which it had ever been\r\n      from 1595.\r\n\r\n      In 1688, Mr Gregory King, a man famous for his knowledge in matters of\r\n      this kind, estimated the average price of wheat, in years of moderate\r\n      plenty, to be to the grower 3s. 6d. the bushel, or eight-and-twenty\r\n      shillings the quarter. The grower’s price I understand to be the same with\r\n      what is sometimes called the contract price, or the price at which a\r\n      farmer contracts for a certain number of years to deliver a certain\r\n      quantity of corn to a dealer. As a contract of this kind saves the farmer\r\n      the expense and trouble of marketing, the contract price is generally\r\n      lower than what is supposed to be the average market price. Mr King had\r\n      judged eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter to be at that time the\r\n      ordinary contract price in years of moderate plenty. Before the scarcity\r\n      occasioned by the late extraordinary course of bad seasons, it was, I have\r\n      been assured, the ordinary contract price in all common years.\r\n\r\n      In 1688 was granted the parliamentary bounty upon the exportation of corn.\r\n      The country gentlemen, who then composed a still greater proportion of the\r\n      legislature than they do at present, had felt that the money price of corn\r\n      was falling. The bounty was an expedient to raise it artificially to the\r\n      high price at which it had frequently been sold in the times of Charles I.\r\n      and II. It was to take place, therefore, till wheat was so high as\r\n      fortyeight shillings the quarter; that is, twenty shillings, or 5-7ths\r\n      dearer than Mr King had, in that very year, estimated the grower’s price\r\n      to be in times of moderate plenty. If his calculations deserve any part of\r\n      the reputation which they have obtained very universally, eight-and-forty\r\n      shillings the quarter was a price which, without some such expedient as\r\n      the bounty, could not at that time be expected, except in years of\r\n      extraordinary scarcity. But the government of King William was not then\r\n      fully settled. It was in no condition to refuse anything to the country\r\n      gentlemen, from whom it was, at that very time, soliciting the first\r\n      establishment of the annual land-tax.\r\n\r\n      The value of silver, therefore, in proportion to that of corn, had\r\n      probably risen somewhat before the end of the last century; and it seems\r\n      to have continued to do so during the course of the greater part of the\r\n      present, though the necessary operation of the bounty must have hindered\r\n      that rise from being so sensible as it otherwise would have been in the\r\n      actual state of tillage.\r\n\r\n      In plentiful years, the bounty, by occasioning an extraordinary\r\n      exportation, necessarily raises the price of corn above what it otherwise\r\n      would be in those years. To encourage tillage, by keeping up the price of\r\n      corn, even in the most plentiful years, was the avowed end of the\r\n      institution.\r\n\r\n      In years of great scarcity, indeed, the bounty has generally been\r\n      suspended. It must, however, have had some effect upon the prices of many\r\n      of those years. By the extraordinary exportation which it occasions in\r\n      years of plenty, it must frequently hinder the plenty of one year from\r\n      compensating the scarcity of another.\r\n\r\n      Both in years of plenty and in years of scarcity, therefore, the bounty\r\n      raises the price of corn above what it naturally would be in the actual\r\n      state of tillage. If during the sixty-four first years of the present\r\n      century, therefore, the average price has been lower than during the\r\n      sixty-four last years of the last century, it must, in the same state of\r\n      tillage, have been much more so, had it not been for this operation of the\r\n      bounty.\r\n\r\n      But, without the bounty, it may be said the state of tillage would not\r\n      have been the same. What may have been the effects of this institution\r\n      upon the agriculture of the country, I shall endeavour to explain\r\n      hereafter, when I come to treat particularly of bounties. I shall only\r\n      observe at present, that this rise in the value of silver, in proportion\r\n      to that of corn, has not been peculiar to England. It has been observed to\r\n      have taken place in France during the same period, and nearly in the same\r\n      proportion, too, by three very faithful, diligent, and laborious\r\n      collectors of the prices of corn, Mr Dupré de St Maur, Mr Messance, and\r\n      the author of the Essay on the Police of Grain. But in France, till 1764,\r\n      the exportation of grain was by law prohibited; and it is somewhat\r\n      difficult to suppose, that nearly the same diminution of price which took\r\n      place in one country, notwithstanding this prohibition, should, in\r\n      another, be owing to the extraordinary encouragement given to exportation.\r\n\r\n      It would be more proper, perhaps, to consider this variation in the\r\n      average money price of corn as the effect rather of some gradual rise in\r\n      the real value of silver in the European market, than of any fall in the\r\n      real average value of corn. Corn, it has already been observed, is, at\r\n      distant periods of time, a more accurate measure of value than either\r\n      silver or, perhaps, any other commodity. When, after the discovery of the\r\n      abundant mines of America, corn rose to three and four times its former\r\n      money price, this change was universally ascribed, not to any rise in the\r\n      real value of corn, but to a fall in the real value of silver. If, during\r\n      the sixty-four first years of the present century, therefore, the average\r\n      money price of corn has fallen somewhat below what it had been during the\r\n      greater part of the last century, we should, in the same manner, impute\r\n      this change, not to any fall in the real value of corn, but to some rise\r\n      in the real value of silver in the European market.\r\n\r\n      The high price of corn during these ten or twelve years past, indeed, has\r\n      occasioned a suspicion that the real value of silver still continues to\r\n      fall in the European market. This high price of corn, however, seems\r\n      evidently to have been the effect of the extraordinary unfavourableness of\r\n      the seasons, and ought, therefore, to be regarded, not as a permanent, but\r\n      as a transitory and occasional event. The seasons, for these ten or twelve\r\n      years past, have been unfavourable through the greater part of Europe; and\r\n      the disorders of Poland have very much increased the scarcity in all those\r\n      countries, which, in dear years, used to be supplied from that market. So\r\n      long a course of bad seasons, though not a very common event, is by no\r\n      means a singular one; and whoever has inquired much into the history of\r\n      the prices of corn in former times, will be at no loss to recollect\r\n      several other examples of the same kind. Ten years of extraordinary\r\n      scarcity, besides, are not more wonderful than ten years of extraordinary\r\n      plenty. The low price of corn, from 1741 to 1750, both inclusive, may very\r\n      well be set in opposition to its high price during these last eight or ten\r\n      years. From 1741 to 1750, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels\r\n      of the best wheat, at Windsor market, it appears from the accounts of Eton\r\n      college, was only £ 1:13:9 ⅘, which is nearly 6s.3d. below the average\r\n      price of the sixty-four first years of the present century. The average\r\n      price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat comes out, according\r\n      to this account, to have been, during these ten years, only £ 1:6:8.\r\n\r\n      Between 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty must have hindered the price of\r\n      corn from falling so low in the home market as it naturally would have\r\n      done. During these ten years, the quantity of all sorts of grain exported,\r\n      it appears from the custom-house books, amounted to no less than 8,029,156\r\n      quarters, one bushel. The bounty paid for this amounted to £\r\n      1,514,962:17:4 ½. In 1749, accordingly, Mr Pelham, at that time prime\r\n      minister, observed to the house of commons, that, for the three years\r\n      preceding, a very extraordinary sum had been paid as bounty for the\r\n      exportation of corn. He had good reason to make this observation, and in\r\n      the following year he might have had still better. In that single year,\r\n      the bounty paid amounted to no less than £ 324,176:10:6. {See Tracts on\r\n      the Corn Trade, Tract 3,} It is unnecessary to observe how much this\r\n      forced exportation must have raised the price of corn above what it\r\n      otherwise would have been in the home market.\r\n\r\n      At the end of the accounts annexed to this chapter the reader will find\r\n      the particular account of those ten years separated from the rest. He will\r\n      find there, too, the particular account of the preceding ten years, of\r\n      which the average is likewise below, though not so much below, the general\r\n      average of the sixty-four first years of the century. The year 1740,\r\n      however, was a year of extraordinary scarcity. These twenty years\r\n      preceding 1750 may very well be set in opposition to the twenty preceding\r\n      1770. As the former were a good deal below the general average of the\r\n      century, notwithstanding the intervention of one or two dear years; so the\r\n      latter have been a good deal above it, notwithstanding the intervention of\r\n      one or two cheap ones, of 1759, for example. If the former have not been\r\n      as much below the general average as the latter have been above it, we\r\n      ought probably to impute it to the bounty. The change has evidently been\r\n      too sudden to be ascribed to any change in the value of silver, which is\r\n      always slow and gradual. The suddenness of the effect can be accounted for\r\n      only by a cause which can operate suddenly, the accidental variations of\r\n      the seasons.\r\n\r\n      The money price of labour in Great Britain has, indeed, risen during the\r\n      course of the present century. This, however, seems to be the effect, not\r\n      so much of any diminution in the value of silver in the European market,\r\n      as of an increase in the demand for labour in Great Britain, arising from\r\n      the great, and almost universal prosperity of the country. In France, a\r\n      country not altogether so prosperous, the money price of labour has, since\r\n      the middle of the last century, been observed to sink gradually with the\r\n      average money price of corn. Both in the last century and in the present,\r\n      the day wages of common labour are there said to have been pretty\r\n      uniformly about the twentieth part of the average price of the septier of\r\n      wheat; a measure which contains a little more than four Winchester\r\n      bushels. In Great Britain, the real recompence of labour, it has already\r\n      been shewn, the real quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies of\r\n      life which are given to the labourer, has increased considerably during\r\n      the course of the present century. The rise in its money price seems to\r\n      have been the effect, not of any diminution of the value of silver in the\r\n      general market of Europe, but of a rise in the real price of labour, in\r\n      the particular market of Great Britain, owing to the peculiarly happy\r\n      circumstances of the country.\r\n\r\n      For some time after the first discovery of America, silver would continue\r\n      to sell at its former, or not much below its former price. The profits of\r\n      mining would for some time be very great, and much above their natural\r\n      rate. Those who imported that metal into Europe, however, would soon find\r\n      that the whole annual importation could not be disposed of at this high\r\n      price. Silver would gradually exchange for a smaller and a smaller\r\n      quantity of goods. Its price would sink gradually lower and lower, till it\r\n      fell to its natural price; or to what was just sufficient to pay,\r\n      according to their natural rates, the wages of the labour, the profits of\r\n      the stock, and the rent of the land, which must be paid in order to bring\r\n      it from the mine to the market. In the greater part of the silver mines of\r\n      Peru, the tax of the king of Spain, amounting to a tenth of the gross\r\n      produce, eats up, it has already been observed, the whole rent of the\r\n      land. This tax was originally a half; it soon afterwards fell to a third,\r\n      then to a fifth, and at last to a tenth, at which late it still continues.\r\n      In the greater part of the silver mines of Peru, this, it seems, is all\r\n      that remains, after replacing the stock of the undertaker of the work,\r\n      together with its ordinary profits; and it seems to be universally\r\n      acknowledged that these profits, which were once very high, are now as low\r\n      as they can well be, consistently with carrying on the works.\r\n\r\n      The tax of the king of Spain was reduced to a fifth of the registered\r\n      silver in 1504 {Solorzano, vol, ii.}, one-and-forty years before 1545, the\r\n      date of the discovery of the mines of Potosi. In the course of ninety\r\n      years, or before 1636, these mines, the most fertile in all America, had\r\n      time sufficient to produce their full effect, or to reduce the value of\r\n      silver in the European market as low as it could well fall, while it\r\n      continued to pay this tax to the king of Spain. Ninety years is time\r\n      sufficient to reduce any commodity, of which there is no monopoly, to its\r\n      natural price, or to the lowest price at which, while it pays a particular\r\n      tax, it can continue to be sold for any considerable time together.\r\n\r\n      The price of silver in the European market might, perhaps, have fallen\r\n      still lower, and it might have become necessary either to reduce the tax\r\n      upon it, not only to one-tenth, as in 1736, but to one twentieth, in the\r\n      same manner as that upon gold, or to give up working the greater part of\r\n      the American mines which are now wrought. The gradual increase of the\r\n      demand for silver, or the gradual enlargement of the market for the\r\n      produce of the silver mines of America, is probably the cause which has\r\n      prevented this from happening, and which has not only kept up the value of\r\n      silver in the European market, but has perhaps even raised it somewhat\r\n      higher than it was about the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\n      Since the first discovery of America, the market for the produce of its\r\n      silver mines has been growing gradually more and more extensive.\r\n\r\n      First, the market of Europe has become gradually more and more extensive.\r\n      Since the discovery of America, the greater part of Europe has been much\r\n      improved. England, Holland, France, and Germany; even Sweden, Denmark, and\r\n      Russia, have all advanced considerably, both in agriculture and in\r\n      manufactures. Italy seems not to have gone backwards. The fall of Italy\r\n      preceded the conquest of Peru. Since that time it seems rather to have\r\n      recovered a little. Spain and Portugal, indeed, are supposed to have gone\r\n      backwards. Portugal, however, is but a very small part of Europe, and the\r\n      declension of Spain is not, perhaps, so great as is commonly imagined. In\r\n      the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain was a very poor country,\r\n      even in comparison with France, which has been so much improved since that\r\n      time. It was the well known remark of the emperor Charles V. who had\r\n      travelled so frequently through both countries, that every thing abounded\r\n      in France, but that every thing was wanting in Spain. The increasing\r\n      produce of the agriculture and manufactures of Europe must necessarily\r\n      have required a gradual increase in the quantity of silver coin to\r\n      circulate it; and the increasing number of wealthy individuals must have\r\n      required the like increase in the quantity of their plate and other\r\n      ornaments of silver.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, America is itself a new market, for the produce of its own\r\n      silver mines; and as its advances in agriculture, industry, and\r\n      population, are much more rapid than those of the most thriving countries\r\n      in Europe, its demand must increase much more rapidly. The English\r\n      colonies are altogether a new market, which, partly for coin, and partly\r\n      for plate, requires a continual augmenting supply of silver through a\r\n      great continent where there never was any demand before. The greater part,\r\n      too, of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, are altogether new markets.\r\n      New Granada, the Yucatan, Paraguay, and the Brazils, were, before\r\n      discovered by the Europeans, inhabited by savage nations, who had neither\r\n      arts nor agriculture. A considerable degree of both has now been\r\n      introduced into all of them. Even Mexico and Peru, though they cannot be\r\n      considered as altogether new markets, are certainly much more extensive\r\n      ones than they ever were before. After all the wonderful tales which have\r\n      been published concerning the splendid state of those countries in ancient\r\n      times, whoever reads, with any degree of sober judgment, the history of\r\n      their first discovery and conquest, will evidently discern that, in arts,\r\n      agriculture, and commerce, their inhabitants were much more ignorant than\r\n      the Tartars of the Ukraine are at present. Even the Peruvians, the more\r\n      civilized nation of the two, though they made use of gold and silver as\r\n      ornaments, had no coined money of any kind. Their whole commerce was\r\n      carried on by barter, and there was accordingly scarce any division of\r\n      labour among them. Those who cultivated the ground, were obliged to build\r\n      their own houses, to make their own household furniture, their own\r\n      clothes, shoes, and instruments of agriculture. The few artificers among\r\n      them are said to have been all maintained by the sovereign, the nobles,\r\n      and the priests, and were probably their servants or slaves. All the\r\n      ancient arts of Mexico and Peru have never furnished one single\r\n      manufacture to Europe. The Spanish armies, though they scarce ever\r\n      exceeded five hundred men, and frequently did not amount to half that\r\n      number, found almost everywhere great difficulty in procuring subsistence.\r\n      The famines which they are said to have occasioned almost wherever they\r\n      went, in countries, too, which at the same time are represented as very\r\n      populous and well cultivated, sufficiently demonstrate that the story of\r\n      this populousness and high cultivation is in a great measure fabulous. The\r\n      Spanish colonies are under a government in many respects less favourable\r\n      to agriculture, improvement, and population, than that of the English\r\n      colonies. They seem, however, to be advancing in all those much more\r\n      rapidly than any country in Europe. In a fertile soil and happy climate,\r\n      the great abundance and cheapness of land, a circumstance common to all\r\n      new colonies, is, it seems, so great an advantage, as to compensate many\r\n      defects in civil government. Frezier, who visited Peru in 1713, represents\r\n      Lima as containing between twenty-five and twenty-eight thousand\r\n      inhabitants. Ulloa, who resided in the same country between 1740 and 1746,\r\n      represents it as containing more than fifty thousand. The difference in\r\n      their accounts of the populousness of several other principal towns of\r\n      Chili and Peru is nearly the same; and as there seems to be no reason to\r\n      doubt of the good information of either, it marks an increase which is\r\n      scarce inferior to that of the English colonies. America, therefore, is a\r\n      new market for the produce of its own silver mines, of which the demand\r\n      must increase much more rapidly than that of the most thriving country in\r\n      Europe.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, the East Indies is another market for the produce of the silver\r\n      mines of America, and a market which, from the time of the first discovery\r\n      of those mines, has been continually taking off a greater and a greater\r\n      quantity of silver. Since that time, the direct trade between America and\r\n      the East Indies, which is carried on by means of the Acapulco ships, has\r\n      been continually augmenting, and the indirect intercourse by the way of\r\n      Europe has been augmenting in a still greater proportion. During the\r\n      sixteenth century, the Portuguese were the only European nation who\r\n      carried on any regular trade to the East Indies. In the last years of that\r\n      century, the Dutch began to encroach upon this monopoly, and in a few\r\n      years expelled them from their principal settlements in India. During the\r\n      greater part of the last century, those two nations divided the most\r\n      considerable part of the East India trade between them; the trade of the\r\n      Dutch continually augmenting in a still greater proportion than that of\r\n      the Portuguese declined. The English and French carried on some trade with\r\n      India in the last century, but it has been greatly augmented in the course\r\n      of the present. The East India trade of the Swedes and Danes began in the\r\n      course of the present century. Even the Muscovites now trade regularly\r\n      with China, by a sort of caravans which go over land through Siberia and\r\n      Tartary to Pekin. The East India trade of all these nations, if we except\r\n      that of the French, which the last war had well nigh annihilated, has been\r\n      almost continually augmenting. The increasing consumptions of East India\r\n      goods in Europe is, it seems, so great, as to afford a gradual increase of\r\n      employment to them all. Tea, for example, was a drug very little used in\r\n      Europe, before the middle of the last century. At present, the value of\r\n      the tea annually imported by the English East India company, for the use\r\n      of their own countrymen, amounts to more than a million and a half a year;\r\n      and even this is not enough; a great deal more being constantly smuggled\r\n      into the country from the ports of Holland, from Gottenburgh in Sweden,\r\n      and from the coast of France, too, as long as the French East India\r\n      company was in prosperity. The consumption of the porcelain of China, of\r\n      the spiceries of the Moluccas, of the piece goods of Bengal, and of\r\n      innumerable other articles, has increased very nearly in a like\r\n      proportion. The tonnage, accordingly, of all the European shipping\r\n      employed in the East India trade, at any one time during the last century,\r\n      was not, perhaps, much greater than that of the English East India company\r\n      before the late reduction of their shipping.\r\n\r\n      But in the East Indies, particularly in China and Indostan, the value of\r\n      the precious metals, when the Europeans first began to trade to those\r\n      countries, was much higher than in Europe; and it still continues to be\r\n      so. In rice countries, which generally yield two, sometimes three crops in\r\n      the year, each of them more plentiful than any common crop of corn, the\r\n      abundance of food must be much greater than in any corn country of equal\r\n      extent. Such countries are accordingly much more populous. In them, too,\r\n      the rich, having a greater superabundance of food to dispose of beyond\r\n      what they themselves can consume, have the means of purchasing a much\r\n      greater quantity of the labour of other people. The retinue of a grandee\r\n      in China or Indostan accordingly is, by all accounts, much more numerous\r\n      and splendid than that of the richest subjects in Europe. The same\r\n      superabundance of food, of which they have the disposal, enables them to\r\n      give a greater quantity of it for all those singular and rare productions\r\n      which nature furnishes but in very small quantities; such as the precious\r\n      metals and the precious stones, the great objects of the competition of\r\n      the rich. Though the mines, therefore, which supplied the Indian market,\r\n      had been as abundant as those which supplied the European, such\r\n      commodities would naturally exchange for a greater quantity of food in\r\n      India than in Europe. But the mines which supplied the Indian market with\r\n      the precious metals seem to have been a good deal less abundant, and those\r\n      which supplied it with the precious stones a good deal more so, than the\r\n      mines which supplied the European. The precious metals, therefore, would\r\n      naturally exchange in India for a somewhat greater quantity of the\r\n      precious stones, and for a much greater quantity of food than in Europe.\r\n      The money price of diamonds, the greatest of all superfluities, would be\r\n      somewhat lower, and that of food, the first of all necessaries, a great\r\n      deal lower in the one country than in the other. But the real price of\r\n      labour, the real quantity of the necessaries of life which is given to the\r\n      labourer, it has already been observed, is lower both in China and\r\n      Indostan, the two great markets of India, than it is through the greater\r\n      part of Europe. The wages of the labourer will there purchase a smaller\r\n      quantity of food: and as the money price of food is much lower in India\r\n      than in Europe, the money price of labour is there lower upon a double\r\n      account; upon account both of the small quantity of food which it will\r\n      purchase, and of the low price of that food. But in countries of equal art\r\n      and industry, the money price of the greater part of manufactures will be\r\n      in proportion to the money price of labour; and in manufacturing art and\r\n      industry, China and Indostan, though inferior, seem not to be much\r\n      inferior to any part of Europe. The money price of the greater part of\r\n      manufactures, therefore, will naturally be much lower in those great\r\n      empires than it is anywhere in Europe. Through the greater part of Europe,\r\n      too, the expense of land-carriage increases very much both the real and\r\n      nominal price of most manufactures. It costs more labour, and therefore\r\n      more money, to bring first the materials, and afterwards the complete\r\n      manufacture to market. In China and Indostan, the extent and variety of\r\n      inland navigations save the greater part of this labour, and consequently\r\n      of this money, and thereby reduce still lower both the real and the\r\n      nominal price of the greater part of their manufactures. Upon all these\r\n      accounts, the precious metals are a commodity which it always has been,\r\n      and still continues to be, extremely advantageous to carry from Europe to\r\n      India. There is scarce any commodity which brings a better price there; or\r\n      which, in proportion to the quantity of labour and commodities which it\r\n      costs in Europe, will purchase or command a greater quantity of labour and\r\n      commodities in India. It is more advantageous, too, to carry silver\r\n      thither than gold; because in China, and the greater part of the other\r\n      markets of India, the proportion between fine silver and fine gold is but\r\n      as ten, or at most as twelve to one; whereas in Europe it is as fourteen\r\n      or fifteen to one. In China, and the greater part of the other markets of\r\n      India, ten, or at most twelve ounces of silver, will purchase an ounce of\r\n      gold; in Europe, it requires from fourteen to fifteen ounces. In the\r\n      cargoes, therefore, of the greater part of European ships which sail to\r\n      India, silver has generally been one of the most valuable articles. It is\r\n      the most valuable article in the Acapulco ships which sail to Manilla. The\r\n      silver of the new continent seems, in this manner, to be one of the\r\n      principal commodities by which the commerce between the two extremities of\r\n      the old one is carried on; and it is by means of it, in a great measure,\r\n      that those distant parts of the world are connected with one another.\r\n\r\n      In order to supply so very widely extended a market, the quantity of\r\n      silver annually brought from the mines must not only be sufficient to\r\n      support that continued increase, both of coin and of plate, which is\r\n      required in all thriving countries; but to repair that continual waste and\r\n      consumption of silver which takes place in all countries where that metal\r\n      is used.\r\n\r\n      The continual consumption of the precious metals in coin by wearing, and\r\n      in plate both by wearing and cleaning, is very sensible; and in\r\n      commodities of which the use is so very widely extended, would alone\r\n      require a very great annual supply. The consumption of those metals in\r\n      some particular manufactures, though it may not perhaps be greater upon\r\n      the whole than this gradual consumption, is, however, much more sensible,\r\n      as it is much more rapid. In the manufactures of Birmingham alone, the\r\n      quantity of gold and silver annually employed in gilding and plating, and\r\n      thereby disqualified from ever afterwards appearing in the shape of those\r\n      metals, is said to amount to more than fifty thousand pounds sterling. We\r\n      may from thence form some notion how great must be the annual consumption\r\n      in all the different parts of the world, either in manufactures of the\r\n      same kind with those of Birmingham, or in laces, embroideries, gold and\r\n      silver stuffs, the gilding of books, furniture, etc. A considerable\r\n      quantity, too, must be annually lost in transporting those metals from one\r\n      place to another both by sea and by land. In the greater part of the\r\n      governments of Asia, besides, the almost universal custom of concealing\r\n      treasures in the bowels of the earth, of which the knowledge frequently\r\n      dies with the person who makes the concealment, must occasion the loss of\r\n      a still greater quantity.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of gold and silver imported at both Cadiz and Lisbon\r\n      (including not only what comes under register, but what may be supposed to\r\n      be smuggled) amounts, according to the best accounts, to about six\r\n      millions sterling a-year.\r\n\r\n      According to Mr Meggens {Postscript to the Universal Merchant p. 15 and\r\n      16. This postscript was not printed till 1756, three years after the\r\n      publication of the book, which has never had a second edition. The\r\n      postscript is, therefore, to be found in few copies; it corrects several\r\n      errors in the book.}, the annual importation of the precious metals into\r\n      Spain, at an average of six years, viz. from 1748 to 1753, both inclusive,\r\n      and into Portugal, at an average of seven years, viz. from 1747 to 1753,\r\n      both inclusive, amounted in silver to 1,101,107 pounds weight, and in gold\r\n      to 49,940 pounds weight. The silver, at sixty two shillings the pound\r\n      troy, amounts to £ 3,413,431:10s. sterling. The gold, at forty-four\r\n      guineas and a half the pound troy, amounts to £ 2,333,446:14s. sterling.\r\n      Both together amount to £ 5,746,878:4s. sterling. The account of what was\r\n      imported under register, he assures us, is exact. He gives us the detail\r\n      of the particular places from which the gold and silver were brought, and\r\n      of the particular quantity of each metal, which, according to the\r\n      register, each of them afforded. He makes an allowance, too, for the\r\n      quantity of each metal which, he supposes, may have been smuggled. The\r\n      great experience of this judicious merchant renders his opinion of\r\n      considerable weight.\r\n\r\n      According to the eloquent, and sometimes well-informed, author of the\r\n      Philosophical and Political History of the Establishment of the Europeans\r\n      in the two Indies, the annual importation of registered gold and silver\r\n      into Spain, at an average of eleven years, viz. from 1754 to 1764, both\r\n      inclusive, amounted to 13,984,185 ⅗ piastres of ten reals. On account of\r\n      what may have been smuggled, however, the whole annual importation, he\r\n      supposes, may have amounted to seventeen millions of piastres, which, at\r\n      4s. 6d. the piastre, is equal to £ 3,825,000 sterling. He gives the\r\n      detail, too, of the particular places from which the gold and silver were\r\n      brought, and of the particular quantities of each metal, which according\r\n      to the register, each of them afforded. He informs us, too, that if we\r\n      were to judge of the quantity of gold annually imported from the Brazils\r\n      to Lisbon, by the amount of the tax paid to the king of Portugal, which it\r\n      seems, is one-fifth of the standard metal, we might value it at eighteen\r\n      millions of cruzadoes, or forty-five millions of French livres, equal to\r\n      about twenty millions sterling. On account of what may have been smuggled,\r\n      however, we may safely, he says, add to this sum an eighth more, or £\r\n      250,000 sterling, so that the whole will amount to £ 2,250,000 sterling.\r\n      According to this account, therefore, the whole annual importation of the\r\n      precious metals into both Spain and Portugal, mounts to about £ 6,075,000\r\n      sterling.\r\n\r\n      Several other very well authenticated, though manuscript accounts, I have\r\n      been assured, agree in making this whole annual importation amount, at an\r\n      average, to about six millions sterling; sometimes a little more,\r\n      sometimes a little less.\r\n\r\n      The annual importation of the precious metals into Cadiz and Lisbon,\r\n      indeed, is not equal to the whole annual produce of the mines of America.\r\n      Some part is sent annually by the Acapulco ships to Manilla; some part is\r\n      employed in a contraband trade, which the Spanish colonies carry on with\r\n      those of other European nations; and some part, no doubt, remains in the\r\n      country. The mines of America, besides, are by no means the only gold and\r\n      silver mines in the world. They, are, however, by far the most abundant.\r\n      The produce of all the other mines which are known is insignificant, it is\r\n      acknowledged, in comparison with theirs; and the far greater part of\r\n      their produce, it is likewise acknowledged, is annually imported into\r\n      Cadiz and Lisbon. But the consumption of Birmingham alone, at the rate of\r\n      fifty thousand pounds a-year, is equal to the hundred-and-twentieth part\r\n      of this annual importation, at the rate of six millions a-year. The whole\r\n      annual consumption of gold and silver, therefore, in all the different\r\n      countries of the world where those metals are used, may, perhaps, be\r\n      nearly equal to the whole annual produce. The remainder may be no more\r\n      than sufficient to supply the increasing demand of all thriving countries.\r\n      It may even have fallen so far short of this demand, as somewhat to raise\r\n      the price of those metals in the European market.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of brass and iron annually brought from the mine to the\r\n      market, is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and silver. We\r\n      do not, however, upon this account, imagine that those coarse metals are\r\n      likely to multiply beyond the demand, or to become gradually cheaper and\r\n      cheaper. Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do\r\n      so? The coarse metals, indeed, though harder, are put to much harder uses,\r\n      and, as they are of less value, less care is employed in their\r\n      preservation. The precious metals, however, are not necessarily immortal\r\n      any more than they, but are liable, too, to be lost, wasted, and consumed,\r\n      in a great variety of ways.\r\n\r\n      The price of all metals, though liable to slow and gradual variations,\r\n      varies less from year to year than that of almost any other part of the\r\n      rude produce of land: and the price of the precious metals is even less\r\n      liable to sudden variations than that of the coarse ones. The durableness\r\n      of metals is the foundation of this extraordinary steadiness of price. The\r\n      corn which was brought to market last year will be all, or almost all,\r\n      consumed, long before the end of this year. But some part of the iron\r\n      which was brought from the mine two or three hundred years ago, may be\r\n      still in use, and, perhaps, some part of the gold which was brought from\r\n      it two or three thousand years ago. The different masses of corn, which,\r\n      in different years, must supply the consumption of the world, will always\r\n      be nearly in proportion to the respective produce of those different\r\n      years. But the proportion between the different masses of iron which may\r\n      be in use in two different years, will be very little affected by any\r\n      accidental difference in the produce of the iron mines of those two years;\r\n      and the proportion between the masses of gold will be still less affected\r\n      by any such difference in the produce of the gold mines. Though the\r\n      produce of the greater part of metallic mines, therefore, varies, perhaps,\r\n      still more from year to year than that of the greater part of corn fields,\r\n      those variations have not the same effect upon the price of the one\r\n      species of commodities as upon that of the other.\r\n\r\n      _Variations in the Proportion between the respective Values of Gold and\r\n      Silver._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Before the discovery of the mines of America, the value of fine gold to\r\n      fine silver was regulated in the different mines of Europe, between the\r\n      proportions of one to ten and one to twelve; that is, an ounce of fine\r\n      gold was supposed to be worth from ten to twelve ounces of fine silver.\r\n      About the middle of the last century, it came to be regulated, between the\r\n      proportions of one to fourteen and one to fifteen; that is, an ounce of\r\n      fine gold came to be supposed worth between fourteen and fifteen ounces of\r\n      fine silver. Gold rose in its nominal value, or in the quantity of silver\r\n      which was given for it. Both metals sunk in their real value, or in the\r\n      quantity of labour which they could purchase; but silver sunk more than\r\n      gold. Though both the gold and silver mines of America exceeded in\r\n      fertility all those which had ever been known before, the fertility of the\r\n      silver mines had, it seems, been proportionally still greater than that of\r\n      the gold ones.\r\n\r\n      The great quantities of silver carried annually from Europe to India,\r\n      have, in some of the English settlements, gradually reduced the value of\r\n      that metal in proportion to gold. In the mint of Calcutta, an ounce of\r\n      fine gold is supposed to be worth fifteen ounces of fine silver, in the\r\n      same manner as in Europe. It is in the mint, perhaps, rated too high for\r\n      the value which it bears in the market of Bengal. In China, the proportion\r\n      of gold to silver still continues as one to ten, or one to twelve. In\r\n      Japan, it is said to be as one to eight.\r\n\r\n      The proportion between the quantities of gold and silver annually imported\r\n      into Europe, according to Mr Meggens’ account, is as one to twenty-two\r\n      nearly; that is, for one ounce of gold there are imported a little more\r\n      than twenty-two ounces of silver. The great quantity of silver sent\r\n      annually to the East Indies reduces, he supposes, the quantities of those\r\n      metals which remain in Europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or\r\n      fifteen, the proportion of their values. The proportion between their\r\n      values, he seems to think, must necessarily be the same as that between\r\n      their quantities, and would therefore be as one to twenty-two, were it not\r\n      for this greater exportation of silver.\r\n\r\n      But the ordinary proportion between the respective values of two\r\n      commodities is not necessarily the same as that between the quantities of\r\n      them which are commonly in the market. The price of an ox, reckoned at ten\r\n      guineas, is about three score times the price of a lamb, reckoned at 3s.\r\n      6d. It would be absurd, however, to infer from thence, that there are\r\n      commonly in the market three score lambs for one ox; and it would be just\r\n      as absurd to infer, because an ounce of gold will commonly purchase from\r\n      fourteen or fifteen ounces of silver, that there are commonly in the\r\n      market only fourteen or fifteen ounces of silver for one ounce of gold.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of silver commonly in the market, it is probable, is much\r\n      greater in proportion to that of gold, than the value of a certain\r\n      quantity of gold is to that of an equal quantity of silver. The whole\r\n      quantity of a cheap commodity brought to market is commonly not only\r\n      greater, but of greater value, than the whole quantity of a dear one. The\r\n      whole quantity of bread annually brought to market, is not only greater,\r\n      but of greater value, than the whole quantity of butcher’s meat; the whole\r\n      quantity of butcher’s meat, than the whole quantity of poultry; and the\r\n      whole quantity of poultry, than the whole quantity of wild fowl. There are\r\n      so many more purchasers for the cheap than for the dear commodity, that,\r\n      not only a greater quantity of it, but a greater value can commonly be\r\n      disposed of. The whole quantity, therefore, of the cheap commodity, must\r\n      commonly be greater in proportion to the whole quantity of the dear one,\r\n      than the value of a certain quantity of the dear one, is to the value of\r\n      an equal quantity of the cheap one. When we compare the precious metals\r\n      with one another, silver is a cheap, and gold a dear commodity. We ought\r\n      naturally to expect, therefore, that there should always be in the market,\r\n      not only a greater quantity, but a greater value of silver than of gold.\r\n      Let any man, who has a little of both, compare his own silver with his\r\n      gold plate, and he will probably find, that not only the quantity, but the\r\n      value of the former, greatly exceeds that of the latter. Many people,\r\n      besides, have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate, which, even\r\n      with those who have it, is generally confined to watch-cases, snuff-boxes,\r\n      and such like trinkets, of which the whole amount is seldom of great\r\n      value. In the British coin, indeed, the value of the gold preponderates\r\n      greatly, but it is not so in that of all countries. In the coin of some\r\n      countries, the value of the two metals is nearly equal. In the Scotch\r\n      coin, before the union with England, the gold preponderated very little,\r\n      though it did somewhat {See Ruddiman’s Preface to Anderson’s Diplomata,\r\n      etc. Scotiae.}, as it appears by the accounts of the mint. In the coin of\r\n      many countries the silver preponderates. In France, the largest sums are\r\n      commonly paid in that metal, and it is there difficult to get more gold\r\n      than what is necessary to carry about in your pocket. The superior value,\r\n      however, of the silver plate above that of the gold, which takes place in\r\n      all countries, will much more than compensate the preponderancy of the\r\n      gold coin above the silver, which takes place only in some countries.\r\n\r\n      Though, in one sense of the word, silver always has been, and probably\r\n      always will be, much cheaper than gold; yet, in another sense, gold may\r\n      perhaps, in the present state of the Spanish market, be said to be\r\n      somewhat cheaper than silver. A commodity may be said to be dear or cheap\r\n      not only according to the absolute greatness or smallness of its usual\r\n      price, but according as that price is more or less above the lowest for\r\n      which it is possible to bring it to market for any considerable time\r\n      together. This lowest price is that which barely replaces, with a moderate\r\n      profit, the stock which must be employed in bringing the commodity\r\n      thither. It is the price which affords nothing to the landlord, of which\r\n      rent makes not any component part, but which resolves itself altogether\r\n      into wages and profit. But, in the present state of the Spanish market,\r\n      gold is certainly somewhat nearer to this lowest price than silver. The\r\n      tax of the king of Spain upon gold is only one-twentieth part of the\r\n      standard metal, or five per cent.; whereas his tax upon silver amounts to\r\n      one-tenth part of it, or to ten per cent. In these taxes, too, it has\r\n      already been observed, consists the whole rent of the greater part of the\r\n      gold and silver mines of Spanish America; and that upon gold is still\r\n      worse paid than that upon silver. The profits of the undertakers of gold\r\n      mines, too, as they more rarely make a fortune, must, in general, be still\r\n      more moderate than those of the undertakers of silver mines. The price of\r\n      Spanish gold, therefore, as it affords both less rent and less profit,\r\n      must, in the Spanish market, be somewhat nearer to the lowest price for\r\n      which it is possible to bring it thither, than the price of Spanish\r\n      silver. When all expenses are computed, the whole quantity of the one\r\n      metal, it would seem, cannot, in the Spanish market, be disposed of so\r\n      advantageously as the whole quantity of the other. The tax, indeed, of the\r\n      king of Portugal upon the gold of the Brazils, is the same with the\r\n      ancient tax of the king of Spain upon the silver of Mexico and Peru; or\r\n      one-fifth part of the standard metal. It may therefore be uncertain,\r\n      whether, to the general market of Europe, the whole mass of American gold\r\n      comes at a price nearer to the lowest for which it is possible to bring it\r\n      thither, than the whole mass of American silver.\r\n\r\n      The price of diamonds and other precious stones may, perhaps, be still\r\n      nearer to the lowest price at which it is possible to bring them to\r\n      market, than even the price of gold.\r\n\r\n      Though it is not very probable that any part of a tax, which is not only\r\n      imposed upon one of the most proper subjects of taxation, a mere luxury\r\n      and superfluity, but which affords so very important a revenue as the tax\r\n      upon silver, will ever be given up as long as it is possible to pay it;\r\n      yet the same impossibility of paying it, which, in 1736. made it necessary\r\n      to reduce it from one-fifth to one-tenth, may in time make it necessary to\r\n      reduce it still further; in the same manner as it made it necessary to\r\n      reduce the tax upon gold to one-twentieth. That the silver mines of\r\n      Spanish America, like all other mines, become gradually more expensive in\r\n      the working, on account of the greater depths at which it is necessary to\r\n      carry on the works, and of the greater expense of drawing out the water,\r\n      and of supplying them with fresh air at those depths, is acknowledged by\r\n      everybody who has inquired into the state of those mines.\r\n\r\n      These causes, which are equivalent to a growing scarcity of silver (for a\r\n      commodity may be said to grow scarcer when it becomes more difficult and\r\n      expensive to collect a certain quantity of it), must, in time, produce one\r\n      or other of the three following events: The increase of the expense must\r\n      either, first, be compensated altogether by a proportionable increase in\r\n      the price of the metal; or, secondly, it must be compensated altogether by\r\n      a proportionable diminution of the tax upon silver; or, thirdly, it must\r\n      be compensated partly by the one and partly by the other of those two\r\n      expedients. This third event is very possible. As gold rose in its price\r\n      in proportion to silver, notwithstanding a great diminution of the tax\r\n      upon gold, so silver might rise in its price in proportion to labour and\r\n      commodities, notwithstanding an equal diminution of the tax upon silver.\r\n\r\n      Such successive reductions of the tax, however, though they may not\r\n      prevent altogether, must certainly retard, more or less, the rise of the\r\n      value of silver in the European market. In consequence of such reductions,\r\n      many mines may be wrought which could not be wrought before, because they\r\n      could not afford to pay the old tax; and the quantity of silver annually\r\n      brought to market, must always be somewhat greater, and, therefore, the\r\n      value of any given quantity somewhat less, than it otherwise would have\r\n      been. In consequence of the reduction in 1736, the value of silver in the\r\n      European market, though it may not at this day be lower than before that\r\n      reduction, is, probably, at least ten per cent. lower than it would have\r\n      been, had the court of Spain continued to exact the old tax. That,\r\n      notwithstanding this reduction, the value of silver has, during the course\r\n      of the present century, begun to rise somewhat in the European market, the\r\n      facts and arguments which have been alleged above, dispose me to believe,\r\n      or more properly to suspect and conjecture; for the best opinion which I\r\n      can form upon this subject, scarce, perhaps, deserves the name of belief.\r\n      The rise, indeed, supposing there has been any, has hitherto been so very\r\n      small, that after all that has been said, it may, perhaps, appear to many\r\n      people uncertain, not only whether this event has actually taken place,\r\n      but whether the contrary may not have taken place, or whether the value of\r\n      silver may not still continue to fall in the European market.\r\n\r\n      It must be observed, however, that whatever may be the supposed annual\r\n      importation of gold and silver, there must be a certain period at which\r\n      the annual consumption of those metals will be equal to that annual\r\n      importation. Their consumption must increase as their mass increases, or\r\n      rather in a much greater proportion. As their mass increases, their value\r\n      diminishes. They are more used, and less cared for, and their consumption\r\n      consequently increases in a greater proportion than their mass. After a\r\n      certain period, therefore, the annual consumption of those metals must, in\r\n      this manner, become equal to their annual importation, provided that\r\n      importation is not continually increasing; which, in the present times, is\r\n      not supposed to be the case.\r\n\r\n      If, when the annual consumption has become equal to the annual\r\n      importation, the annual importation should gradually diminish, the annual\r\n      consumption may, for some time, exceed the annual importation. The mass of\r\n      those metals may gradually and insensibly diminish, and their value\r\n      gradually and insensibly rise, till the annual importation becoming again\r\n      stationary, the annual consumption will gradually and insensibly\r\n      accommodate itself to what that annual importation can maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Grounds of the suspicion that the Value of Silver still continues to\r\n      decrease._\r\n\r\n\r\n      The increase of the wealth of Europe, and the popular notion, that as the\r\n      quantity of the precious metals naturally increases with the increase of\r\n      wealth, so their value diminishes as their quantity increases, may,\r\n      perhaps, dispose many people to believe that their value still continues\r\n      to fall in the European market; and the still gradually increasing price\r\n      of many parts of the rude produce of land may confirm them still farther\r\n      in this opinion.\r\n\r\n      That that increase in the quantity of the precious metals, which arises in\r\n      any country from the increase of wealth, has no tendency to diminish their\r\n      value, I have endeavoured to shew already. Gold and silver naturally\r\n      resort to a rich country, for the same reason that all sorts of luxuries\r\n      and curiosities resort to it; not because they are cheaper there than in\r\n      poorer countries, but because they are dearer, or because a better price\r\n      is given for them. It is the superiority of price which attracts them; and\r\n      as soon as that superiority ceases, they necessarily cease to go thither.\r\n\r\n      If you except corn, and such other vegetables as are raised altogether by\r\n      human industry, that all other sorts of rude produce, cattle, poultry,\r\n      game of all kinds, the useful fossils and minerals of the earth, etc.\r\n      naturally grow dearer, as the society advances in wealth and improvement,\r\n      I have endeavoured to shew already. Though such commodities, therefore,\r\n      come to exchange for a greater quantity of silver than before, it will not\r\n      from thence follow that silver has become really cheaper, or will purchase\r\n      less labour than before; but that such commodities have become really\r\n      dearer, or will purchase more labour than before. It is not their nominal\r\n      price only, but their real price, which rises in the progress of\r\n      improvement. The rise of their nominal price is the effect, not of any\r\n      degradation of the value of silver, but of the rise in their real price.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Different Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon three different\r\n      sorts of rude Produce._\r\n\r\n\r\n      These different sorts of rude produce may be divided into three classes.\r\n      The first comprehends those which it is scarce in the power of human\r\n      industry to multiply at all. The second, those which it can multiply in\r\n      proportion to the demand. The third, those in which the efficacy of\r\n      industry is either limited or uncertain. In the progress of wealth and\r\n      improvement, the real price of the first may rise to any degree of\r\n      extravagance, and seems not to be limited by any certain boundary. That of\r\n      the second, though it may rise greatly, has, however, a certain boundary,\r\n      beyond which it cannot well pass for any considerable time together. That\r\n      of the third, though its natural tendency is to rise in the progress of\r\n      improvement, yet in the same degree of improvement it may sometimes happen\r\n      even to fall, sometimes to continue the same, and sometimes to rise more\r\n      or less, according as different accidents render the efforts of human\r\n      industry, in multiplying this sort of rude produce, more or less\r\n      successful.\r\n\r\n      First Sort.—The first sort of rude produce, of which the price rises\r\n      in the progress of improvement, is that which it is scarce in the power of\r\n      human industry to multiply at all. It consists in those things which\r\n      nature produces only in certain quantities, and which being of a very\r\n      perishable nature, it is impossible to accumulate together the produce of\r\n      many different seasons. Such are the greater part of rare and singular\r\n      birds and fishes, many different sorts of game, almost all wild-fowl, all\r\n      birds of passage in particular, as well as many other things. When wealth,\r\n      and the luxury which accompanies it, increase, the demand for these is\r\n      likely to increase with them, and no effort of human industry may be able\r\n      to increase the supply much beyond what it was before this increase of the\r\n      demand. The quantity of such commodities, therefore, remaining the same,\r\n      or nearly the same, while the competition to purchase them is continually\r\n      increasing, their price may rise to any degree of extravagance, and seems\r\n      not to be limited by any certain boundary. If woodcocks should become so\r\n      fashionable as to sell for twenty guineas a-piece, no effort of human\r\n      industry could increase the number of those brought to market, much beyond\r\n      what it is at present. The high price paid by the Romans, in the time of\r\n      their greatest grandeur, for rare birds and fishes, may in this manner\r\n      easily be accounted for. These prices were not the effects of the low\r\n      value of silver in those times, but of the high value of such rarities and\r\n      curiosities as human industry could not multiply at pleasure. The real\r\n      value of silver was higher at Rome, for sometime before, and after the\r\n      fall of the republic, than it is through the greater part of Europe at\r\n      present. Three sestertii equal to about sixpence sterling, was the price\r\n      which the republic paid for the modius or peck of the tithe wheat of\r\n      Sicily. This price, however, was probably below the average market price,\r\n      the obligation to deliver their wheat at this rate being considered as a\r\n      tax upon the Sicilian farmers. When the Romans, therefore, had occasion to\r\n      order more corn than the tithe of wheat amounted to, they were bound by\r\n      capitulation to pay for the surplus at the rate of four sestertii, or\r\n      eightpence sterling the peck; and this had probably been reckoned the\r\n      moderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or average contract price\r\n      of those times; it is equal to about one-and-twenty shillings the quarter.\r\n      Eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter was, before the late years of\r\n      scarcity, the ordinary contract price of English wheat, which in quality\r\n      is inferior to the Sicilian, and generally sells for a lower price in the\r\n      European market. The value of silver, therefore, in those ancient times,\r\n      must have been to its value in the present, as three to four inversely;\r\n      that is, three ounces of silver would then have purchased the same\r\n      quantity of labour and commodities which four ounces will do at present.\r\n      When we read in Pliny, therefore, that Seius {Lib. X, c. 29.} bought a\r\n      white nightingale, as a present for the empress Agrippina, at the price of\r\n      six thousand sestertii, equal to about fifty pounds of our present money;\r\n      and that Asinius Celer {Lib. IX, c. 17.} purchased a surmullet at the\r\n      price of eight thousand sestertii, equal to about sixty-six pounds\r\n      thirteen shillings and fourpence of our present money; the extravagance of\r\n      those prices, how much soever it may surprise us, is apt, notwithstanding,\r\n      to appear to us about one third less than it really was. Their real price,\r\n      the quantity of labour and subsistence which was given away for them, was\r\n      about one-third more than their nominal price is apt to express to us in\r\n      the present times. Seius gave for the nightingale the command of a\r\n      quantity of labour and subsistence, equal to what £ 66:13: 4d. would\r\n      purchase in the present times; and Asinius Celer gave for a surmullet the\r\n      command of a quantity equal to what £ 88:17: 9d. would purchase. What\r\n      occasioned the extravagance of those high prices was, not so much the\r\n      abundance of silver, as the abundance of labour and subsistence, of which\r\n      those Romans had the disposal, beyond what was necessary for their own\r\n      use. The quantity of silver, of which they had the disposal, was a good\r\n      deal less than what the command of the same quantity of labour and\r\n      subsistence would have procured to them in the present times.\r\n\r\n      Second sort.—The second sort of rude produce, of which the price\r\n      rises in the progress of improvement, is that which human industry can\r\n      multiply in proportion to the demand. It consists in those useful plants\r\n      and animals, which, in uncultivated countries, nature produces with such\r\n      profuse abundance, that they are of little or no value, and which, as\r\n      cultivation advances, are therefore forced to give place to some more\r\n      profitable produce. During a long period in the progress of improvement,\r\n      the quantity of these is continually diminishing, while, at the same time,\r\n      the demand for them is continually increasing. Their real value,\r\n      therefore, the real quantity of labour which they will purchase or\r\n      command, gradually rises, till at last it gets so high as to render them\r\n      as profitable a produce as any thing else which human industry can raise\r\n      upon the most fertile and best cultivated land. When it has got so high,\r\n      it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land and more industry would\r\n      soon be employed to increase their quantity.\r\n\r\n      When the price of cattle, for example, rises so high, that it is as\r\n      profitable to cultivate land in order to raise food for them as in order\r\n      to raise food for man, it cannot well go higher. If it did, more corn land\r\n      would soon be turned into pasture. The extension of tillage, by\r\n      diminishing the quantity of wild pasture, diminishes the quantity of\r\n      butcher’s meat, which the country naturally produces without labour or\r\n      cultivation; and, by increasing the number of those who have either corn,\r\n      or, what comes to the same thing, the price of corn, to give in exchange\r\n      for it, increases the demand. The price of butcher’s meat, therefore, and,\r\n      consequently, of cattle, must gradually rise, till it gets so high, that\r\n      it becomes as profitable to employ the most fertile and best cultivated\r\n      lands in raising food for them as in raising corn. But it must always be\r\n      late in the progress of improvement before tillage can be so far extended\r\n      as to raise the price of cattle to this height; and, till it has got to\r\n      this height, if the country is advancing at all, their price must be\r\n      continually rising. There are, perhaps, some parts of Europe in which the\r\n      price of cattle has not yet got to this height. It had not got to this\r\n      height in any part of Scotland before the Union. Had the Scotch cattle\r\n      been always confined to the market of Scotland, in a country in which the\r\n      quantity of land, which can be applied to no other purpose but the feeding\r\n      of cattle, is so great in proportion to what can be applied to other\r\n      purposes, it is scarce possible, perhaps, that their price could ever have\r\n      risen so high as to render it profitable to cultivate land for the sake of\r\n      feeding them. In England, the price of cattle, it has already been\r\n      observed, seems, in the neighbourhood of London, to have got to this\r\n      height about the beginning of the last century; but it was much later,\r\n      probably, before it got through the greater part of the remoter counties,\r\n      in some of which, perhaps, it may scarce yet have got to it. Of all the\r\n      different substances, however, which compose this second sort of rude\r\n      produce, cattle is, perhaps, that of which the price, in the progress of\r\n      improvement, rises first to this height.\r\n\r\n      Till the price of cattle, indeed, has got to this height, it seems scarce\r\n      possible that the greater part, even of those lands which are capable of\r\n      the highest cultivation, can be completely cultivated. In all farms too\r\n      distant from any town to carry manure from it, that is, in the far greater\r\n      part of those of every extensive country, the quantity of well cultivated\r\n      land must be in proportion to the quantity of manure which the farm itself\r\n      produces; and this, again, must be in proportion to the stock of cattle\r\n      which are maintained upon it. The land is manured, either by pasturing the\r\n      cattle upon it, or by feeding them in the stable, and from thence carrying\r\n      out their dung to it. But unless the price of the cattle be sufficient to\r\n      pay both the rent and profit of cultivated land, the farmer cannot afford\r\n      to pasture them upon it; and he can still less afford to feed them in the\r\n      stable. It is with the produce of improved and cultivated land only that\r\n      cattle can be fed in the stable; because, to collect the scanty and\r\n      scattered produce of waste and unimproved lands, would require too much\r\n      labour, and be too expensive. If the price of the cattle, therefore, is\r\n      not sufficient to pay for the produce of improved and cultivated land,\r\n      when they are allowed to pasture it, that price will be still less\r\n      sufficient to pay for that produce, when it must be collected with a good\r\n      deal of additional labour, and brought into the stable to them. In these\r\n      circumstances, therefore, no more cattle can with profit be fed in the\r\n      stable than what are necessary for tillage. But these can never afford\r\n      manure enough for keeping constantly in good condition all the lands which\r\n      they are capable of cultivating. What they afford, being insufficient for\r\n      the whole farm, will naturally be reserved for the lands to which it can\r\n      be most advantageously or conveniently applied; the most fertile, or\r\n      those, perhaps, in the neighbourhood of the farm-yard. These, therefore,\r\n      will be kept constantly in good condition, and fit for tillage. The rest\r\n      will, the greater part of them, be allowed to lie waste, producing scarce\r\n      any thing but some miserable pasture, just sufficient to keep alive a few\r\n      straggling, half-starved cattle; the farm, though much overstocked in\r\n      proportion to what would be necessary for its complete cultivation, being\r\n      very frequently overstocked in proportion to its actual produce. A portion\r\n      of this waste land, however, after having been pastured in this wretched\r\n      manner for six or seven years together, may be ploughed up, when it will\r\n      yield, perhaps, a poor crop or two of bad oats, or of some other coarse\r\n      grain; and then, being entirely exhausted, it must be rested and pastured\r\n      again as before, and another portion ploughed up, to be in the same manner\r\n      exhausted and rested again in its turn. Such, accordingly, was the general\r\n      system of management all over the low country of Scotland before the\r\n      Union. The lands which were kept constantly well manured and in good\r\n      condition seldom exceeded a third or fourth part of the whole farm, and\r\n      sometimes did not amount to a fifth or a sixth part of it. The rest were\r\n      never manured, but a certain portion of them was in its turn,\r\n      notwithstanding, regularly cultivated and exhausted. Under this system of\r\n      management, it is evident, even that part of the lands of Scotland which\r\n      is capable of good cultivation, could produce but little in comparison of\r\n      what it may be capable of producing. But how disadvantageous soever this\r\n      system may appear, yet, before the Union, the low price of cattle seems to\r\n      have rendered it almost unavoidable. If, notwithstanding a great rise in\r\n      the price, it still continues to prevail through a considerable part of\r\n      the country, it is owing in many places, no doubt, to ignorance and\r\n      attachment to old customs, but, in most places, to the unavoidable\r\n      obstructions which the natural course of things opposes to the immediate\r\n      or speedy establishment of a better system: first, to the poverty of the\r\n      tenants, to their not having yet had time to acquire a stock of cattle\r\n      sufficient to cultivate their lands more completely, the same rise of\r\n      price, which would render it advantageous for them to maintain a greater\r\n      stock, rendering it more difficult for them to acquire it; and, secondly,\r\n      to their not having yet had time to put their lands in condition to\r\n      maintain this greater stock properly, supposing they were capable of\r\n      acquiring it. The increase of stock and the improvement of land are two\r\n      events which must go hand in hand, and of which the one can nowhere much\r\n      outrun the other. Without some increase of stock, there can be scarce any\r\n      improvement of land, but there can be no considerable increase of stock,\r\n      but in consequence of a considerable improvement of land; because\r\n      otherwise the land could not maintain it. These natural obstructions to\r\n      the establishment of a better system, cannot be removed but by a long\r\n      course of frugality and industry; and half a century or a century more,\r\n      perhaps, must pass away before the old system, which is wearing out\r\n      gradually, can be completely abolished through all the different parts of\r\n      the country. Of all the commercial advantages, however, which Scotland has\r\n      derived from the Union with England, this rise in the price of cattle is,\r\n      perhaps, the greatest. It has not only raised the value of all highland\r\n      estates, but it has, perhaps, been the principal cause of the improvement\r\n      of the low country.\r\n\r\n      In all new colonies, the great quantity of waste land, which can for many\r\n      years be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle, soon\r\n      renders them extremely abundant; and in every thing great cheapness is the\r\n      necessary consequence of great abundance. Though all the cattle of the\r\n      European colonies in America were originally carried from Europe, they\r\n      soon multiplied so much there, and became of so little value, that even\r\n      horses were allowed to run wild in the woods, without any owner thinking\r\n      it worth while to claim them. It must be a long time after the first\r\n      establishment of such colonies, before it can become profitable to feed\r\n      cattle upon the produce of cultivated land. The same causes, therefore,\r\n      the want of manure, and the disproportion between the stock employed in\r\n      cultivation and the land which it is destined to cultivate, are likely to\r\n      introduce there a system of husbandry, not unlike that which still\r\n      continues to take place in so many parts of Scotland. Mr Kalm, the Swedish\r\n      traveller, when he gives an account of the husbandry of some of the\r\n      English colonies in North America, as he found it in 1749, observes,\r\n      accordingly, that he can with difficulty discover there the character of\r\n      the English nation, so well skilled in all the different branches of\r\n      agriculture. They make scarce any manure for their corn fields, he says;\r\n      but when one piece of ground has been exhausted by continual cropping,\r\n      they clear and cultivate another piece of fresh land; and when that is\r\n      exhausted, proceed to a third. Their cattle are allowed to wander through\r\n      the woods and other uncultivated grounds, where they are half-starved;\r\n      having long ago extirpated almost all the annual grasses, by cropping them\r\n      too early in the spring, before they had time to form their flowers, or to\r\n      shed their seeds. {Kalm’s Travels, vol 1, pp. 343, 344.} The annual\r\n      grasses were, it seems, the best natural grasses in that part of North\r\n      America; and when the Europeans first settled there, they used to grow\r\n      very thick, and to rise three or four feet high. A piece of ground which,\r\n      when he wrote, could not maintain one cow, would in former times, he was\r\n      assured, have maintained four, each of which would have given four times\r\n      the quantity of milk which that one was capable of giving. The poorness of\r\n      the pasture had, in his opinion, occasioned the degradation of their\r\n      cattle, which degenerated sensibly from one generation to another. They\r\n      were probably not unlike that stunted breed which was common all over\r\n      Scotland thirty or forty years ago, and which is now so much mended\r\n      through the greater part of the low country, not so much by a change of\r\n      the breed, though that expedient has been employed in some places, as by a\r\n      more plentiful method of feeding them.\r\n\r\n      Though it is late, therefore, in the progress of improvement, before\r\n      cattle can bring such a price as to render it profitable to cultivate land\r\n      for the sake of feeding them; yet of all the different parts which compose\r\n      this second sort of rude produce, they are perhaps the first which bring\r\n      this price; because, till they bring it, it seems impossible that\r\n      improvement can be brought near even to that degree of perfection to which\r\n      it has arrived in many parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n      As cattle are among the first, so perhaps venison is among the last parts\r\n      of this sort of rude produce which bring this price. The price of venison\r\n      in Great Britain, how extravagant soever it may appear, is not near\r\n      sufficient to compensate the expense of a deer park, as is well known to\r\n      all those who have had any experience in the feeding of deer. If it was\r\n      otherwise, the feeding of deer would soon become an article of common\r\n      farming, in the same manner as the feeding of those small birds, called\r\n      turdi, was among the ancient Romans. Varro and Columella assure us, that\r\n      it was a most profitable article. The fattening of ortolans, birds of\r\n      passage which arrive lean in the country, is said to be so in some parts\r\n      of France. If venison continues in fashion, and the wealth and luxury of\r\n      Great Britain increase as they have done for some time past, its price may\r\n      very probably rise still higher than it is at present.\r\n\r\n      Between that period in the progress of improvement, which brings to its\r\n      height the price of so necessary an article as cattle, and that which\r\n      brings to it the price of such a superfluity as venison, there is a very\r\n      long interval, in the course of which many other sorts of rude produce\r\n      gradually arrive at their highest price, some sooner and some later,\r\n      according to different circumstances.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in every farm, the offals of the barn and stable will maintain a\r\n      certain number of poultry. These, as they are fed with what would\r\n      otherwise be lost, are a mere save-all; and as they cost the farmer scarce\r\n      any thing, so he can afford to sell them for very little. Almost all that\r\n      he gets is pure gain, and their price can scarce be so low as to\r\n      discourage him from feeding this number. But in countries ill cultivated,\r\n      and therefore but thinly inhabited, the poultry, which are thus raised\r\n      without expense, are often fully sufficient to supply the whole demand. In\r\n      this state of things, therefore, they are often as cheap as butcher’s\r\n      meat, or any other sort of animal food. But the whole quantity of poultry\r\n      which the farm in this manner produces without expense, must always be\r\n      much smaller than the whole quantity of butcher’s meat which is reared\r\n      upon it; and in times of wealth and luxury, what is rare, with only nearly\r\n      equal merit, is always preferred to what is common. As wealth and luxury\r\n      increase, therefore, in consequence of improvement and cultivation, the\r\n      price of poultry gradually rises above that of butcher’s meat, till at\r\n      last it gets so high, that it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the\r\n      sake of feeding them. When it has got to this height, it cannot well go\r\n      higher. If it did, more land would soon be turned to this purpose. In\r\n      several provinces of France, the feeding of poultry is considered as a\r\n      very important article in rural economy, and sufficiently profitable to\r\n      encourage the farmer to raise a considerable quantity of Indian corn and\r\n      buckwheat for this purpose. A middling farmer will there sometimes have\r\n      four hundred fowls in his yard. The feeding of poultry seems scarce yet to\r\n      be generally considered as a matter of so much importance in England. They\r\n      are certainly, however, dearer in England than in France, as England\r\n      receives considerable supplies from France. In the progress of\r\n      improvements, the period at which every particular sort of animal food is\r\n      dearest, must naturally be that which immediately precedes the general\r\n      practice of cultivating land for the sake of raising it. For some time\r\n      before this practice becomes general, the scarcity must necessarily raise\r\n      the price. After it has become general, new methods of feeding are\r\n      commonly fallen upon, which enable the farmer to raise upon the same\r\n      quantity of ground a much greater quantity of that particular sort of\r\n      animal food. The plenty not only obliges him to sell cheaper, but, in\r\n      consequence of these improvements, he can afford to sell cheaper; for if\r\n      he could not afford it, the plenty would not be of long continuance. It\r\n      has been probably in this manner that the introduction of clover, turnips,\r\n      carrots, cabbages, etc. has contributed to sink the common price of\r\n      butcher’s meat in the London market, somewhat below what it was about the\r\n      beginning of the last century.\r\n\r\n      The hog, that finds his food among ordure, and greedily devours many\r\n      things rejected by every other useful animal, is, like poultry, originally\r\n      kept as a save-all. As long as the number of such animals, which can thus\r\n      be reared at little or no expense, is fully sufficient to supply the\r\n      demand, this sort of butcher’s meat comes to market at a much lower price\r\n      than any other. But when the demand rises beyond what this quantity can\r\n      supply, when it becomes necessary to raise food on purpose for feeding and\r\n      fattening hogs, in the same manner as for feeding and fattening other\r\n      cattle, the price necessarily rises, and becomes proportionably either\r\n      higher or lower than that of other butcher’s meat, according as the nature\r\n      of the country, and the state of its agriculture, happen to render the\r\n      feeding of hogs more or less expensive than that of other cattle. In\r\n      France, according to Mr Buffon, the price of pork is nearly equal to that\r\n      of beef. In most parts of Great Britain it is at present somewhat higher.\r\n\r\n      The great rise in the price both of hogs and poultry, has, in Great\r\n      Britain, been frequently imputed to the diminution of the number of\r\n      cottagers and other small occupiers of land; an event which has in every\r\n      part of Europe been the immediate forerunner of improvement and better\r\n      cultivation, but which at the same time may have contributed to raise the\r\n      price of those articles, both somewhat sooner and somewhat faster than it\r\n      would otherwise have risen. As the poorest family can often maintain a cat\r\n      or a dog without any expense, so the poorest occupiers of land can\r\n      commonly maintain a few poultry, or a sow and a few pigs, at very little.\r\n      The little offals of their own table, their whey, skimmed milk, and butter\r\n      milk, supply those animals with a part of their food, and they find the\r\n      rest in the neighbouring fields, without doing any sensible damage to any\r\n      body. By diminishing the number of those small occupiers, therefore, the\r\n      quantity of this sort of provisions, which is thus produced at little or\r\n      no expense, must certainly have been a good deal diminished, and their\r\n      price must consequently have been raised both sooner and faster than it\r\n      would otherwise have risen. Sooner or later, however, in the progress of\r\n      improvement, it must at any rate have risen to the utmost height to which\r\n      it is capable of rising; or to the price which pays the labour and expense\r\n      of cultivating the land which furnishes them with food, as well as these\r\n      are paid upon the greater part of other cultivated land.\r\n\r\n      The business of the dairy, like the feeding of hogs and poultry, is\r\n      originally carried on as a save-all. The cattle necessarily kept upon the\r\n      farm produce more milk than either the rearing of their own young, or the\r\n      consumption of the farmer’s family requires; and they produce most at one\r\n      particular season. But of all the productions of land, milk is perhaps the\r\n      most perishable. In the warm season, when it is most abundant, it will\r\n      scarce keep four-and-twenty hours. The farmer, by making it into fresh\r\n      butter, stores a small part of it for a week; by making it into salt\r\n      butter, for a year; and by making it into cheese, he stores a much greater\r\n      part of it for several years. Part of all these is reserved for the use of\r\n      his own family; the rest goes to market, in order to find the best price\r\n      which is to be had, and which can scarce be so low is to discourage him\r\n      from sending thither whatever is over and above the use of his own family.\r\n      If it is very low indeed, he will be likely to manage his dairy in a very\r\n      slovenly and dirty manner, and will scarce, perhaps, think it worth while\r\n      to have a particular room or building on purpose for it, but will suffer\r\n      the business to be carried on amidst the smoke, filth, and nastiness of\r\n      his own kitchen, as was the case of almost all the farmers’ dairies in\r\n      Scotland thirty or forty years ago, and as is the case of many of them\r\n      still. The same causes which gradually raise the price of butcher’s meat,\r\n      the increase of the demand, and, in consequence of the improvement of the\r\n      country, the diminution of the quantity which can be fed at little or no\r\n      expense, raise, in the same manner, that of the produce of the dairy, of\r\n      which the price naturally connects with that of butcher’s meat, or with\r\n      the expense of feeding cattle. The increase of price pays for more labour,\r\n      care, and cleanliness. The dairy becomes more worthy of the farmer’s\r\n      attention, and the quality of its produce gradually improves. The price at\r\n      last gets so high, that it becomes worth while to employ some of the most\r\n      fertile and best cultivated lands in feeding cattle merely for the purpose\r\n      of the dairy; and when it has got to this height, it cannot well go\r\n      higher. If it did, more land would soon be turned to this purpose. It\r\n      seems to have got to this height through the greater part of England,\r\n      where much good land is commonly employed in this manner. If you except\r\n      the neighbourhood of a few considerable towns, it seems not yet to have\r\n      got to this height anywhere in Scotland, where common farmers seldom\r\n      employ much good land in raising food for cattle, merely for the purpose\r\n      of the dairy. The price of the produce, though it has risen very\r\n      considerably within these few years, is probably still too low to admit of\r\n      it. The inferiority of the quality, indeed, compared with that of the\r\n      produce of English dairies, is fully equal to that of the price. But this\r\n      inferiority of quality is, perhaps, rather the effect of this lowness of\r\n      price, than the cause of it. Though the quality was much better, the\r\n      greater part of what is brought to market could not, I apprehend, in the\r\n      present circumstances of the country, be disposed of at a much better\r\n      price; and the present price, it is probable, would not pay the expense of\r\n      the land and labour necessary for producing a much better quality. Through\r\n      the greater part of England, notwithstanding the superiority of price, the\r\n      dairy is not reckoned a more profitable employment of land than the\r\n      raising of corn, or the fattening of cattle, the two great objects of\r\n      agriculture. Through the greater part of Scotland, therefore, it cannot\r\n      yet be even so profitable.\r\n\r\n      The lands of no country, it is evident, can ever be completely cultivated\r\n      and improved, till once the price of every produce, which human industry\r\n      is obliged to raise upon them, has got so high as to pay for the expense\r\n      of complete improvement and cultivation. In order to do this, the price of\r\n      each particular produce must be sufficient, first, to pay the rent of good\r\n      corn land, as it is that which regulates the rent of the greater part of\r\n      other cultivated land; and, secondly, to pay the labour and expense of the\r\n      farmer, as well as they are commonly paid upon good corn land; or, in\r\n      other words, to replace with the ordinary profits the stock which he\r\n      employs about it. This rise in the price of each particular produce; must\r\n      evidently be previous to the improvement and cultivation of the land which\r\n      is destined for raising it. Gain is the end of all improvement; and\r\n      nothing could deserve that name, of which loss was to be the necessary\r\n      consequence. But loss must be the necessary consequence of improving land\r\n      for the sake of a produce of which the price could never bring back the\r\n      expense. If the complete improvement and cultivation of the country be, as\r\n      it most certainly is, the greatest of all public advantages, this rise in\r\n      the price of all those different sorts of rude produce, instead of being\r\n      considered as a public calamity, ought to be regarded as the necessary\r\n      forerunner and attendant of the greatest of all public advantages.\r\n\r\n      This rise, too, in the nominal or money price of all those different sorts\r\n      of rude produce, has been the effect, not of any degradation in the value\r\n      of silver, but of a rise in their real price. They have become worth, not\r\n      only a greater quantity of silver, but a greater quantity of labour and\r\n      subsistence than before. As it costs a greater quantity of labour and\r\n      subsistence to bring them to market, so, when they are brought thither\r\n      they represent, or are equivalent to a greater quantity.\r\n\r\n      Third Sort.—The third and last sort of rude produce, of which the\r\n      price naturally rises in the progress of improvement, is that in which the\r\n      efficacy of human industry, in augmenting the quantity, is either limited\r\n      or uncertain. Though the real price of this sort of rude produce,\r\n      therefore, naturally tends to rise in the progress of improvement, yet,\r\n      according as different accidents happen to render the efforts of human\r\n      industry more or less successful in augmenting the quantity, it may happen\r\n      sometimes even to fall, sometimes to continue the same, in very different\r\n      periods of improvement, and sometimes to rise more or less in the same\r\n      period.\r\n\r\n      There are some sorts of rude produce which nature has rendered a kind of\r\n      appendages to other sorts; so that the quantity of the one which any\r\n      country can afford, is necessarily limited by that of the other. The\r\n      quantity of wool or of raw hides, for example, which any country can\r\n      afford, is necessarily limited by the number of great and small cattle\r\n      that are kept in it. The state of its improvement, and the nature of its\r\n      agriculture, again necessarily determine this number.\r\n\r\n      The same causes which, in the progress of improvement, gradually raise the\r\n      price of butcher’s meat, should have the same effect, it may be thought,\r\n      upon the prices of wool and raw hides, and raise them, too, nearly in the\r\n      same proportion. It probably would be so, if, in the rude beginnings of\r\n      improvement, the market for the latter commodities was confined within as\r\n      narrow bounds as that for the former. But the extent of their respective\r\n      markets is commonly extremely different.\r\n\r\n      The market for butcher’s meat is almost everywhere confined to the country\r\n      which produces it. Ireland, and some part of British America, indeed,\r\n      carry on a considerable trade in salt provisions; but they are, I believe,\r\n      the only countries in the commercial world which do so, or which export to\r\n      other countries any considerable part of their butcher’s meat.\r\n\r\n      The market for wool and raw hides, on the contrary, is, in the rude\r\n      beginnings of improvement, very seldom confined to the country which\r\n      produces them. They can easily be transported to distant countries; wool\r\n      without any preparation, and raw hides with very little; and as they are\r\n      the materials of many manufactures, the industry of other countries may\r\n      occasion a demand for them, though that of the country which produces them\r\n      might not occasion any.\r\n\r\n      In countries ill cultivated, and therefore but thinly inhabited, the price\r\n      of the wool and the hide bears always a much greater proportion to that of\r\n      the whole beast, than in countries where, improvement and population being\r\n      further advanced, there is more demand for butcher’s meat. Mr Hume\r\n      observes, that in the Saxon times, the fleece was estimated at two-fifths\r\n      of the value of the whole sheep and that this was much above the\r\n      proportion of its present estimation. In some provinces of Spain, I have\r\n      been assured, the sheep is frequently killed merely for the sake of the\r\n      fleece and the tallow. The carcase is often left to rot upon the ground,\r\n      or to be devoured by beasts and birds of prey. If this sometimes happens\r\n      even in Spain, it happens almost constantly in Chili, at Buenos Ayres, and\r\n      in many other parts of Spanish America, where the horned cattle are almost\r\n      constantly killed merely for the sake of the hide and the tallow. This,\r\n      too, used to happen almost constantly in Hispaniola, while it was infested\r\n      by the buccaneers, and before the settlement, improvement, and\r\n      populousness of the French plantations ( which now extend round the coast\r\n      of almost the whole western half of the island) had given some value to\r\n      the cattle of the Spaniards, who still continue to possess, not only the\r\n      eastern part of the coast, but the whole inland mountainous part of the\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      Though, in the progress of improvement and population, the price of the\r\n      whole beast necessarily rises, yet the price of the carcase is likely to\r\n      be much more affected by this rise than that of the wool and the hide. The\r\n      market for the carcase being in the rude state of society confined always\r\n      to the country which produces it, must necessarily be extended in\r\n      proportion to the improvement and population of that country. But the\r\n      market for the wool and the hides, even of a barbarous country, often\r\n      extending to the whole commercial world, it can very seldom be enlarged in\r\n      the same proportion. The state of the whole commercial world can seldom be\r\n      much affected by the improvement of any particular country; and the market\r\n      for such commodities may remain the same, or very nearly the same, after\r\n      such improvements, as before. It should, however, in the natural course of\r\n      things, rather, upon the whole, be somewhat extended in consequence of\r\n      them. If the manufactures, especially, of which those commodities are the\r\n      materials, should ever come to flourish in the country, the market, though\r\n      it might not be much enlarged, would at least be brought much nearer to\r\n      the place of growth than before; and the price of those materials might at\r\n      least be increased by what had usually been the expense of transporting\r\n      them to distant countries. Though it might not rise, therefore, in the\r\n      same proportion as that of butcher’s meat, it ought naturally to rise\r\n      somewhat, and it ought certainly not to fall.\r\n\r\n      In England, however, notwithstanding the flourishing state of its woollen\r\n      manufacture, the price of English wool has fallen very considerably since\r\n      the time of Edward III. There are many authentic records which demonstrate\r\n      that, during the reign of that prince (towards the middle of the\r\n      fourteenth century, or about 1339), what was reckoned the moderate and\r\n      reasonable price of the tod, or twenty-eight pounds of English wool, was\r\n      not less than ten shillings of the money of those times {See Smith’s\r\n      Memoirs of Wool, vol. i c. 5, 6, 7. also vol. ii.}, containing, at the\r\n      rate of twenty-pence the ounce, six ounces of silver, Tower weight, equal\r\n      to about thirty shillings of our present money. In the present times,\r\n      one-and-twenty shillings the tod may be reckoned a good price for very\r\n      good English wool. The money price of wool, therefore, in the time of\r\n      Edward III. was to its money price in the present times as ten to seven.\r\n      The superiority of its real price was still greater. At the rate of six\r\n      shillings and eightpence the quarter, ten shillings was in those ancient\r\n      times the price of twelve bushels of wheat. At the rate of twenty-eight\r\n      shillings the quarter, one-and-twenty shillings is in the present times\r\n      the price of six bushels only. The proportion between the real price of\r\n      ancient and modern times, therefore, is as twelve to six, or as two to\r\n      one. In those ancient times, a tod of wool would have purchased twice the\r\n      quantity of subsistence which it will purchase at present, and\r\n      consequently twice the quantity of labour, if the real recompence of\r\n      labour had been the same in both periods.\r\n\r\n      This degradation, both in the real and nominal value of wool, could never\r\n      have happened in consequence of the natural course of things. It has\r\n      accordingly been the effect of violence and artifice. First, of the\r\n      absolute prohibition of exporting wool from England: secondly, of the\r\n      permission of importing it from Spain, duty free: thirdly, of the\r\n      prohibition of exporting it from Ireland to another country but England.\r\n      In consequence of these regulations, the market for English wool, instead\r\n      of being somewhat extended, in consequence of the improvement of England,\r\n      has been confined to the home market, where the wool of several other\r\n      countries is allowed to come into competition with it, and where that of\r\n      Ireland is forced into competition with it. As the woollen manufactures,\r\n      too, of Ireland, are fully as much discouraged as is consistent with\r\n      justice and fair dealing, the Irish can work up but a smaller part of\r\n      their own wool at home, and are therefore obliged to send a greater\r\n      proportion of it to Great Britain, the only market they are allowed.\r\n\r\n      I have not been able to find any such authentic records concerning the\r\n      price of raw hides in ancient times. Wool was commonly paid as a subsidy\r\n      to the king, and its valuation in that subsidy ascertains, at least in\r\n      some degree, what was its ordinary price. But this seems not to have been\r\n      the case with raw hides. Fleetwood, however, from an account in 1425,\r\n      between the prior of Burcester Oxford and one of his canons, gives us\r\n      their price, at least as it was stated upon that particular occasion, viz.\r\n      five ox hides at twelve shillings; five cow hides at seven shillings and\r\n      threepence; thirtysix sheep skins of two years old at nine shillings;\r\n      sixteen calf skins at two shillings. In 1425, twelve shillings contained\r\n      about the same quantity of silver as four-and-twenty shillings of our\r\n      present money. An ox hide, therefore, was in this account valued at the\r\n      same quantity of silver as 4s. ⅘ths of our present money. Its nominal\r\n      price was a good deal lower than at present. But at the rate of six\r\n      shillings and eightpence the quarter, twelve shillings would in those\r\n      times have purchased fourteen bushels and four-fifths of a bushel of\r\n      wheat, which, at three and sixpence the bushel, would in the present times\r\n      cost 51s. 4d. An ox hide, therefore, would in those times have purchased\r\n      as much corn as ten shillings and threepence would purchase at present.\r\n      Its real value was equal to ten shillings and threepence of our present\r\n      money. In those ancient times, when the cattle were half starved during\r\n      the greater part of the winter, we cannot suppose that they were of a very\r\n      large size. An ox hide which weighs four stone of sixteen pounds of\r\n      avoirdupois, is not in the present times reckoned a bad one; and in those\r\n      ancient times would probably have been reckoned a very good one. But at\r\n      half-a-crown the stone, which at this moment (February 1773) I understand\r\n      to be the common price, such a hide would at present cost only ten\r\n      shillings. Through its nominal price, therefore, is higher in the present\r\n      than it was in those ancient times, its real price, the real quantity of\r\n      subsistence which it will purchase or command, is rather somewhat lower.\r\n      The price of cow hides, as stated in the above account, is nearly in the\r\n      common proportion to that of ox hides. That of sheep skins is a good deal\r\n      above it. They had probably been sold with the wool. That of calves skins,\r\n      on the contrary, is greatly below it. In countries where the price of\r\n      cattle is very low, the calves, which are not intended to be reared in\r\n      order to keep up the stock, are generally killed very young, as was the\r\n      case in Scotland twenty or thirty years ago. It saves the milk, which\r\n      their price would not pay for. Their skins, therefore, are commonly good\r\n      for little.\r\n\r\n      The price of raw hides is a good deal lower at present than it was a few\r\n      years ago; owing probably to the taking off the duty upon seal skins, and\r\n      to the allowing, for a limited time, the importation of raw hides from\r\n      Ireland, and from the plantations, duty free, which was done in 1769. Take\r\n      the whole of the present century at an average, their real price has\r\n      probably been somewhat higher than it was in those ancient times. The\r\n      nature of the commodity renders it not quite so proper for being\r\n      transported to distant markets as wool. It suffers more by keeping. A\r\n      salted hide is reckoned inferior to a fresh one, and sells for a lower\r\n      price. This circumstance must necessarily have some tendency to sink the\r\n      price of raw hides produced in a country which does not manufacture them,\r\n      but is obliged to export them, and comparatively to raise that of those\r\n      produced in a country which does manufacture them. It must have some\r\n      tendency to sink their price in a barbarous, and to raise it in an\r\n      improved and manufacturing country. It must have had some tendency,\r\n      therefore, to sink it in ancient, and to raise it in modern times. Our\r\n      tanners, besides, have not been quite so successful as our clothiers, in\r\n      convincing the wisdom of the nation, that the safety of the commonwealth\r\n      depends upon the prosperity of their particular manufacture. They have\r\n      accordingly been much less favoured. The exportation of raw hides has,\r\n      indeed, been prohibited, and declared a nuisance; but their importation\r\n      from foreign countries has been subjected to a duty; and though this duty\r\n      has been taken off from those of Ireland and the plantations (for the\r\n      limited time of five years only), yet Ireland has not been confined to the\r\n      market of Great Britain for the sale of its surplus hides, or of those\r\n      which are not manufactured at home. The hides of common cattle have, but\r\n      within these few years, been put among the enumerated commodities which\r\n      the plantations can send nowhere but to the mother country; neither has\r\n      the commerce of Ireland been in this case oppressed hitherto, in order to\r\n      support the manufactures of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      Whatever regulations tend to sink the price, either of wool or of raw\r\n      hides, below what it naturally would be, must, in an improved and\r\n      cultivated country, have some tendency to raise the price of butcher’s\r\n      meat. The price both of the great and small cattle, which are fed on\r\n      improved and cultivated land, must be sufficient to pay the rent which the\r\n      landlord, and the profit which the farmer, has reason to expect from\r\n      improved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will soon cease to feed\r\n      them. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and\r\n      the hide, must be paid by the carcase. The less there is paid for the one,\r\n      the more must be paid for the other. In what manner this price is to be\r\n      divided upon the different parts of the beast, is indifferent to the\r\n      landlords and farmers, provided it is all paid to them. In an improved and\r\n      cultivated country, therefore, their interest as landlords and farmers\r\n      cannot be much affected by such regulations, though their interest as\r\n      consumers may, by the rise in the price of provisions. It would be quite\r\n      otherwise, however, in an unimproved and uncultivated country, where the\r\n      greater part of the lands could be applied to no other purpose but the\r\n      feeding of cattle, and where the wool and the hide made the principal part\r\n      of the value of those cattle. Their interest as landlords and farmers\r\n      would in this case be very deeply affected by such regulations, and their\r\n      interest as consumers very little. The fall in the price of the wool and\r\n      the hide would not in this case raise the price of the carcase; because\r\n      the greater part of the lands of the country being applicable to no other\r\n      purpose but the feeding of cattle, the same number would still continue to\r\n      be fed. The same quantity of butcher’s meat would still come to market.\r\n      The demand for it would be no greater than before. Its price, therefore,\r\n      would be the same as before. The whole price of cattle would fall, and\r\n      along with it both the rent and the profit of all those lands of which\r\n      cattle was the principal produce, that is, of the greater part of the\r\n      lands of the country. The perpetual prohibition of the exportation of\r\n      wool, which is commonly, but very falsely, ascribed to Edward III., would,\r\n      in the then circumstances of the country, have been the most destructive\r\n      regulation which could well have been thought of. It would not only have\r\n      reduced the actual value of the greater part of the lands in the kingdom,\r\n      but by reducing the price of the most important species of small cattle,\r\n      it would have retarded very much its subsequent improvement.\r\n\r\n      The wool of Scotland fell very considerably in its price in consequence of\r\n      the union with England, by which it was excluded from the great market of\r\n      Europe, and confined to the narrow one of Great Britain. The value of the\r\n      greater part of the lands in the southern counties of Scotland, which are\r\n      chiefly a sheep country, would have been very deeply affected by this\r\n      event, had not the rise in the price of butcher’s meat fully compensated\r\n      the fall in the price of wool.\r\n\r\n      As the efficacy of human industry, in increasing the quantity either of\r\n      wool or of raw hides, is limited, so far as it depends upon the produce of\r\n      the country where it is exerted; so it is uncertain so far as it depends\r\n      upon the produce of other countries. It so far depends not so much upon\r\n      the quantity which they produce, as upon that which they do not\r\n      manufacture; and upon the restraints which they may or may not think\r\n      proper to impose upon the exportation of this sort of rude produce. These\r\n      circumstances, as they are altogether independent of domestic industry, so\r\n      they necessarily render the efficacy of its efforts more or less\r\n      uncertain. In multiplying this sort of rude produce, therefore, the\r\n      efficacy of human industry is not only limited, but uncertain.\r\n\r\n      In multiplying another very important sort of rude produce, the quantity\r\n      of fish that is brought to market, it is likewise both limited and\r\n      uncertain. It is limited by the local situation of the country, by the\r\n      proximity or distance of its different provinces from the sea, by the\r\n      number of its lakes and rivers, and by what may be called the fertility or\r\n      barrenness of those seas, lakes, and rivers, as to this sort of rude\r\n      produce. As population increases, as the annual produce of the land and\r\n      labour of the country grows greater and greater, there come to be more\r\n      buyers of fish; and those buyers, too, have a greater quantity and variety\r\n      of other goods, or, what is the same thing, the price of a greater\r\n      quantity and variety of other goods, to buy with. But it will generally be\r\n      impossible to supply the great and extended market, without employing a\r\n      quantity of labour greater than in proportion to what had been requisite\r\n      for supplying the narrow and confined one. A market which, from requiring\r\n      only one thousand, comes to require annually ten thousand ton of fish, can\r\n      seldom be supplied, without employing more than ten times the quantity of\r\n      labour which had before been sufficient to supply it. The fish must\r\n      generally be sought for at a greater distance, larger vessels must be\r\n      employed, and more expensive machinery of every kind made use of. The real\r\n      price of this commodity, therefore, naturally rises in the progress of\r\n      improvement. It has accordingly done so, I believe, more or less in every\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      Though the success of a particular day’s fishing may be a very uncertain\r\n      matter, yet the local situation of the country being supposed, the general\r\n      efficacy of industry in bringing a certain quantity of fish to market,\r\n      taking the course of a year, or of several years together, it may,\r\n      perhaps, be thought is certain enough; and it, no doubt, is so. As it\r\n      depends more, however, upon the local situation of the country, than upon\r\n      the state of its wealth and industry; as upon this account it may in\r\n      different countries be the same in very different periods of improvement,\r\n      and very different in the same period; its connection with the state of\r\n      improvement is uncertain; and it is of this sort of uncertainty that I am\r\n      here speaking.\r\n\r\n      In increasing the quantity of the different minerals and metals which are\r\n      drawn from the bowels of the earth, that of the more precious ones\r\n      particularly, the efficacy of human industry seems not to be limited, but\r\n      to be altogether uncertain.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of the precious metals which is to be found in any country,\r\n      is not limited by any thing in its local situation, such as the fertility\r\n      or barrenness of its own mines. Those metals frequently abound in\r\n      countries which possess no mines. Their quantity, in every particular\r\n      country, seems to depend upon two different circumstances; first, upon its\r\n      power of purchasing, upon the state of its industry, upon the annual\r\n      produce of its land and labour, in consequence of which it can afford to\r\n      employ a greater or a smaller quantity of labour and subsistence, in\r\n      bringing or purchasing such superfluities as gold and silver, either from\r\n      its own mines, or from those of other countries; and, secondly, upon the\r\n      fertility or barrenness of the mines which may happen at any particular\r\n      time to supply the commercial world with those metals. The quantity of\r\n      those metals in the countries most remote from the mines, must be more or\r\n      less affected by this fertility or barrenness, on account of the easy and\r\n      cheap transportation of those metals, of their small bulk and great value.\r\n      Their quantity in China and Indostan must have been more or less affected\r\n      by the abundance of the mines of America.\r\n\r\n      So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the former\r\n      of those two circumstances (the power of purchasing), their real price,\r\n      like that of all other luxuries and superfluities, is likely to rise with\r\n      the wealth and improvement of the country, and to fall with its poverty\r\n      and depression. Countries which have a great quantity of labour and\r\n      subsistence to spare, can afford to purchase any particular quantity of\r\n      those metals at the expense of a greater quantity of labour and\r\n      subsistence, than countries which have less to spare.\r\n\r\n      So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the latter\r\n      of those two circumstances (the fertility or barrenness of the mines which\r\n      happen to supply the commercial world), their real price, the real\r\n      quantity of labour and subsistence which they will purchase or exchange\r\n      for, will, no doubt, sink more or less in proportion to the fertility, and\r\n      rise in proportion to the barrenness of those mines.\r\n\r\n      The fertility or barrenness of the mines, however, which may happen at any\r\n      particular time to supply the commercial world, is a circumstance which,\r\n      it is evident, may have no sort of connection with the state of industry\r\n      in a particular country. It seems even to have no very necessary\r\n      connection with that of the world in general. As arts and commerce,\r\n      indeed, gradually spread themselves over a greater and a greater part of\r\n      the earth, the search for new mines, being extended over a wider surface,\r\n      may have somewhat a better chance for being successful than when confined\r\n      within narrower bounds. The discovery of new mines, however, as the old\r\n      ones come to be gradually exhausted, is a matter of the greatest\r\n      uncertainty, and such as no human skill or industry can insure. All\r\n      indications, it is acknowledged, are doubtful; and the actual discovery\r\n      and successful working of a new mine can alone ascertain the reality of\r\n      its value, or even of its existence. In this search there seem to be no\r\n      certain limits, either to the possible success, or to the possible\r\n      disappointment of human industry. In the course of a century or two, it is\r\n      possible that new mines may be discovered, more fertile than any that have\r\n      ever yet been known; and it is just equally possible, that the most\r\n      fertile mine then known may be more barren than any that was wrought\r\n      before the discovery of the mines of America. Whether the one or the other\r\n      of those two events may happen to take place, is of very little importance\r\n      to the real wealth and prosperity of the world, to the real value of the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of mankind. Its nominal value, the\r\n      quantity of gold and silver by which this annual produce could be\r\n      expressed or represented, would, no doubt, be very different; but its real\r\n      value, the real quantity of labour which it could purchase or command,\r\n      would be precisely the same. A shilling might, in the one case, represent\r\n      no more labour than a penny does at present; and a penny, in the other,\r\n      might represent as much as a shilling does now. But in the one case, he\r\n      who had a shilling in his pocket would be no richer than he who has a\r\n      penny at present; and in the other, he who had a penny would be just as\r\n      rich as he who has a shilling now. The cheapness and abundance of gold and\r\n      silver plate would be the sole advantage which the world could derive from\r\n      the one event; and the dearness and scarcity of those trifling\r\n      superfluities, the only inconveniency it could suffer from the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Conclusion of the Digression concerning the Variations in the Value of\r\n      Silver.\r\n\r\n      The greater part of the writers who have collected the money price of\r\n      things in ancient times, seem to have considered the low money price of\r\n      corn, and of goods in general, or, in other words, the high value of gold\r\n      and silver, as a proof, not only of the scarcity of those metals, but of\r\n      the poverty and barbarism of the country at the time when it took place.\r\n      This notion is connected with the system of political economy, which\r\n      represents national wealth as consisting in the abundance and national\r\n      poverty in the scarcity, of gold and silver; a system which I shall\r\n      endeavour to explain and examine at great length in the fourth book of\r\n      this Inquiry. I shall only observe at present, that the high value of the\r\n      precious metals can be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of any\r\n      particular country at the time when it took place. It is a proof only of\r\n      the barrenness of the mines which happened at that time to supply the\r\n      commercial world. A poor country, as it cannot afford to buy more, so it\r\n      can as little afford to pay dearer for gold and silver than a rich one;\r\n      and the value of those metals, therefore, is not likely to be higher in\r\n      the former than in the latter. In China, a country much richer than any\r\n      part of Europe, the value of the precious metals is much higher than in\r\n      any part of Europe. As the wealth of Europe, indeed, has increased greatly\r\n      since the discovery of the mines of America, so the value of gold and\r\n      silver has gradually diminished. This diminution of their value, however,\r\n      has not been owing to the increase of the real wealth of Europe, of the\r\n      annual produce of its land and labour, but to the accidental discovery of\r\n      more abundant mines than any that were known before. The increase of the\r\n      quantity of gold and silver in Europe, and the increase of its\r\n      manufactures and agriculture, are two events which, though they have\r\n      happened nearly about the same time, yet have arisen from very different\r\n      causes, and have scarce any natural connection with one another. The one\r\n      has arisen from a mere accident, in which neither prudence nor policy\r\n      either had or could have any share; the other, from the fall of the feudal\r\n      system, and from the establishment of a government which afforded to\r\n      industry the only encouragement which it requires, some tolerable security\r\n      that it shall enjoy the fruits of its own labour. Poland, where the feudal\r\n      system still continues to take place, is at this day as beggarly a country\r\n      as it was before the discovery of America. The money price of corn,\r\n      however, has risen; the real value of the precious metals has fallen in\r\n      Poland, in the same manner as in other parts of Europe. Their quantity,\r\n      therefore, must have increased there as in other places, and nearly in the\r\n      same proportion to the annual produce of its land and labour. This\r\n      increase of the quantity of those metals, however, has not, it seems,\r\n      increased that annual produce, has neither improved the manufactures and\r\n      agriculture of the country, nor mended the circumstances of its\r\n      inhabitants. Spain and Portugal, the countries which possess the mines,\r\n      are, after Poland, perhaps the two most beggarly countries in Europe. The\r\n      value of the precious metals, however, must be lower in Spain and Portugal\r\n      than in any other part of Europe, as they come from those countries to all\r\n      other parts of Europe, loaded, not only with a freight and an insurance,\r\n      but with the expense of smuggling, their exportation being either\r\n      prohibited or subjected to a duty. In proportion to the annual produce of\r\n      the land and labour, therefore, their quantity must be greater in those\r\n      countries than in any other part of Europe; those countries, however, are\r\n      poorer than the greater part of Europe. Though the feudal system has been\r\n      abolished in Spain and Portugal, it has not been succeeded by a much\r\n      better.\r\n\r\n      As the low value of gold and silver, therefore, is no proof of the wealth\r\n      and flourishing state of the country where it takes place; so neither is\r\n      their high value, or the low money price either of goods in general, or of\r\n      corn in particular, any proof of its poverty and barbarism.\r\n\r\n      But though the low money price, either of goods in general, or of corn in\r\n      particular, be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of the times, the low\r\n      money price of some particular sorts of goods, such as cattle, poultry,\r\n      game of all kinds, etc. in proportion to that of corn, is a most decisive\r\n      one. It clearly demonstrates, first, their great abundance in proportion\r\n      to that of corn, and, consequently, the great extent of the land which\r\n      they occupied in proportion to what was occupied by corn; and, secondly,\r\n      the low value of this land in proportion to that of corn land, and,\r\n      consequently, the uncultivated and unimproved state of the far greater\r\n      part of the lands of the country. It clearly demonstrates, that the stock\r\n      and population of the country did not bear the same proportion to the\r\n      extent of its territory, which they commonly do in civilized countries;\r\n      and that society was at that time, and in that country, but in its\r\n      infancy. From the high or low money price, either of goods in general, or\r\n      of corn in particular, we can infer only, that the mines, which at that\r\n      time happened to supply the commercial world with gold and silver, were\r\n      fertile or barren, not that the country was rich or poor. But from the\r\n      high or low money price of some sorts of goods in proportion to that of\r\n      others, we can infer, with a degree of probability that approaches almost\r\n      to certainty, that it was rich or poor, that the greater part of its lands\r\n      were improved or unimproved, and that it was either in a more or less\r\n      barbarous state, or in a more or less civilized one.\r\n\r\n      Any rise in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether from the\r\n      degradation of the value of silver, would affect all sorts of goods\r\n      equally, and raise their price universally, a third, or a fourth, or a\r\n      fifth part higher, according as silver happened to lose a third, or a\r\n      fourth, or a fifth part of its former value. But the rise in the price of\r\n      provisions, which has been the subject of so much reasoning and\r\n      conversation, does not affect all sorts of provisions equally. Taking the\r\n      course of the present century at an average, the price of corn, it is\r\n      acknowledged, even by those who account for this rise by the degradation\r\n      of the value of silver, has risen much less than that of some other sorts\r\n      of provisions. The rise in the price of those other sorts of provisions,\r\n      therefore, cannot be owing altogether to the degradation of the value of\r\n      silver. Some other causes must be taken into the account; and those which\r\n      have been above assigned, will, perhaps, without having recourse to the\r\n      supposed degradation of the value of silver, sufficiently explain this\r\n      rise in those particular sorts of provisions, of which the price has\r\n      actually risen in proportion to that of corn.\r\n\r\n      As to the price of corn itself, it has, during the sixty-four first years\r\n      of the present century, and before the late extraordinary course of bad\r\n      seasons, been somewhat lower than it was during the sixty-four last years\r\n      of the preceding century. This fact is attested, not only by the accounts\r\n      of Windsor market, but by the public fiars of all the different counties\r\n      of Scotland, and by the accounts of several different markets in France,\r\n      which have been collected with great diligence and fidelity by Mr\r\n      Messance, and by Mr Dupré de St Maur. The evidence is more complete than\r\n      could well have been expected in a matter which is naturally so very\r\n      difficult to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n      As to the high price of corn during these last ten or twelve years, it can\r\n      be sufficiently accounted for from the badness of the seasons, without\r\n      supposing any degradation in the value of silver.\r\n\r\n      The opinion, therefore, that silver is continually sinking in its value,\r\n      seems not to be founded upon any good observations, either upon the prices\r\n      of corn, or upon those of other provisions.\r\n\r\n      The same quantity of silver, it may perhaps be said, will, in the present\r\n      times, even according to the account which has been here given, purchase a\r\n      much smaller quantity of several sorts of provisions than it would have\r\n      done during some part of the last century; and to ascertain whether this\r\n      change be owing to a rise in the value of those goods, or to a fall in the\r\n      value of silver, is only to establish a vain and useless distinction,\r\n      which can be of no sort of service to the man who has only a certain\r\n      quantity of silver to go to market with, or a certain fixed revenue in\r\n      money. I certainly do not pretend that the knowledge of this distinction\r\n      will enable him to buy cheaper. It may not, however, upon that account be\r\n      altogether useless.\r\n\r\n      It may be of some use to the public, by affording an easy proof of the\r\n      prosperous condition of the country. If the rise in the price of some\r\n      sorts of provisions be owing altogether to a fall in the value of silver,\r\n      it is owing to a circumstance, from which nothing can be inferred but the\r\n      fertility of the American mines. The real wealth of the country, the\r\n      annual produce of its land and labour, may, notwithstanding this\r\n      circumstance, be either gradually declining, as in Portugal and Poland; or\r\n      gradually advancing, as in most other parts of Europe. But if this rise in\r\n      the price of some sorts of provisions be owing to a rise in the real value\r\n      of the land which produces them, to its increased fertility, or, in\r\n      consequence of more extended improvement and good cultivation, to its\r\n      having been rendered fit for producing corn; it is owing to a circumstance\r\n      which indicates, in the clearest manner, the prosperous and advancing\r\n      state of the country. The land constitutes by far the greatest, the most\r\n      important, and the most durable part of the wealth of every extensive\r\n      country. It may surely be of some use, or, at least, it may give some\r\n      satisfaction to the public, to have so decisive a proof of the increasing\r\n      value of by far the greatest, the most important, and the most durable\r\n      part of its wealth.\r\n\r\n      It may, too, be of some use to the public, in regulating the pecuniary\r\n      reward of some of its inferior servants. If this rise in the price of some\r\n      sorts of provisions be owing to a fall in the value of silver, their\r\n      pecuniary reward, provided it was not too large before, ought certainly to\r\n      be augmented in proportion to the extent of this fall. If it is not\r\n      augmented, their real recompence will evidently be so much diminished. But\r\n      if this rise of price is owing to the increased value, in consequence of\r\n      the improved fertility of the land which produces such provisions, it\r\n      becomes a much nicer matter to judge, either in what proportion any\r\n      pecuniary reward ought to be augmented, or whether it ought to be\r\n      augmented at all. The extension of improvement and cultivation, as it\r\n      necessarily raises more or less, in proportion to the price of corn, that\r\n      of every sort of animal food, so it as necessarily lowers that of, I\r\n      believe, every sort of vegetable food. It raises the price of animal food;\r\n      because a great part of the land which produces it, being rendered fit for\r\n      producing corn, must afford to the landlord and farmer the rent and\r\n      profit of corn land. It lowers the price of vegetable food; because, by\r\n      increasing the fertility of the land, it increases its abundance. The\r\n      improvements of agriculture, too, introduce many sorts of vegetable food,\r\n      which requiring less land, and not more labour than corn, come much\r\n      cheaper to market. Such are potatoes and maize, or what is called Indian\r\n      corn, the two most important improvements which the agriculture of Europe,\r\n      perhaps, which Europe itself, has received from the great extension of its\r\n      commerce and navigation. Many sorts of vegetable food, besides, which in\r\n      the rude state of agriculture are confined to the kitchen-garden, and\r\n      raised only by the spade, come, in its improved state, to be introduced\r\n      into common fields, and to be raised by the plough; such as turnips,\r\n      carrots, cabbages, etc. If, in the progress of improvement, therefore, the\r\n      real price of one species of food necessarily rises, that of another as\r\n      necessarily falls; and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how far\r\n      the rise in the one may be compensated by the fall in the other. When the\r\n      real price of butcher’s meat has once got to its height (which, with\r\n      regard to every sort, except perhaps that of hogs flesh, it seems to have\r\n      done through a great part of England more than a century ago), any rise\r\n      which can afterwards happen in that of any other sort of animal food,\r\n      cannot much affect the circumstances of the inferior ranks of people. The\r\n      circumstances of the poor, through a great part of England, cannot surely\r\n      be so much distressed by any rise in the price of poultry, fish,\r\n      wild-fowl, or venison, as they must be relieved by the fall in that of\r\n      potatoes.\r\n\r\n      In the present season of scarcity, the high price of corn no doubt\r\n      distresses the poor. But in times of moderate plenty, when corn is at its\r\n      ordinary or average price, the natural rise in the price of any other sort\r\n      of rude produce cannot much affect them. They suffer more, perhaps, by the\r\n      artificial rise which has been occasioned by taxes in the price of some\r\n      manufactured commodities, as of salt, soap, leather, candles, malt, beer,\r\n      ale, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon the real Price of\r\n      Manufactures._\r\n\r\n\r\n      It is the natural effect of improvement, however, to diminish gradually\r\n      the real price of almost all manufactures. That of the manufacturing\r\n      workmanship diminishes, perhaps, in all of them without exception. In\r\n      consequence of better machinery, of greater dexterity, and of a more\r\n      proper division and distribution of work, all of which are the natural\r\n      effects of improvement, a much smaller quantity of labour becomes\r\n      requisite for executing any particular piece of work; and though, in\r\n      consequence of the flourishing circumstances of the society, the real\r\n      price of labour should rise very considerably, yet the great diminution of\r\n      the quantity will generally much more than compensate the greatest rise\r\n      which can happen in the price.\r\n\r\n      There are, indeed, a few manufactures, in which the necessary rise in the\r\n      real price of the rude materials will more than compensate all the\r\n      advantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the work.\r\n      In carpenters’ and joiners’ work, and in the coarser sort of cabinet work,\r\n      the necessary rise in the real price of barren timber, in consequence of\r\n      the improvement of land, will more than compensate all the advantages\r\n      which can be derived from the best machinery, the greatest dexterity, and\r\n      the most proper division and distribution of work.\r\n\r\n      But in all cases in which the real price of the rude material either does\r\n      not rise at all, or does not rise very much, that of the manufactured\r\n      commodity sinks very considerably.\r\n\r\n      This diminution of price has, in the course of the present and preceding\r\n      century, been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the materials\r\n      are the coarser metals. A better movement of a watch, than about the\r\n      middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds, may\r\n      now perhaps be had for twenty shillings. In the work of cutlers and\r\n      locksmiths, in all the toys which are made of the coarser metals, and in\r\n      all those goods which are commonly known by the name of Birmingham and\r\n      Sheffield ware, there has been, during the same period, a very great\r\n      reduction of price, though not altogether so great as in watch-work. It\r\n      has, however, been sufficient to astonish the workmen of every other part\r\n      of Europe, who in many cases acknowledge that they can produce no work of\r\n      equal goodness for double or even for triple the price. There are perhaps\r\n      no manufactures, in which the division of labour can be carried further,\r\n      or in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of\r\n      improvements, than those of which the materials are the coarser metals.\r\n\r\n      In the clothing manufacture there has, during the same period, been no\r\n      such sensible reduction of price. The price of superfine cloth, I have\r\n      been assured, on the contrary, has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty\r\n      years, risen somewhat in proportion to its quality, owing, it was said, to\r\n      a considerable rise in the price of the material, which consists\r\n      altogether of Spanish wool. That of the Yorkshire cloth, which is made\r\n      altogether of English wool, is said, indeed, during the course of the\r\n      present century, to have fallen a good deal in proportion to its quality.\r\n      Quality, however, is so very disputable a matter, that I look upon all\r\n      information of this kind as somewhat uncertain. In the clothing\r\n      manufacture, the division of labour is nearly the same now as it was a\r\n      century ago, and the machinery employed is not very different. There may,\r\n      however, have been some small improvements in both, which may have\r\n      occasioned some reduction of price.\r\n\r\n      But the reduction will appear much more sensible and undeniable, if we\r\n      compare the price of this manufacture in the present times with what it\r\n      was in a much remoter period, towards the end of the fifteenth century,\r\n      when the labour was probably much less subdivided, and the machinery\r\n      employed much more imperfect, than it is at present.\r\n\r\n      In 1487, being the 4th of Henry VII., it was enacted, that “whosoever\r\n      shall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grained, or of\r\n      other grained cloth of the finest making, above sixteen shillings, shall\r\n      forfeit forty shillings for every yard so sold.” Sixteen shillings,\r\n      therefore, containing about the same quantity of silver as four-and-twenty\r\n      shillings of our present money, was, at that time, reckoned not an\r\n      unreasonable price for a yard of the finest cloth; and as this is a\r\n      sumptuary law, such cloth, it is probable, had usually been sold somewhat\r\n      dearer. A guinea may be reckoned the highest price in the present times.\r\n      Even though the quality of the cloths, therefore, should be supposed\r\n      equal, and that of the present times is most probably much superior, yet,\r\n      even upon this supposition, the money price of the finest cloth appears to\r\n      have been considerably reduced since the end of the fifteenth century. But\r\n      its real price has been much more reduced. Six shillings and eightpence\r\n      was then, and long afterwards, reckoned the average price of a quarter of\r\n      wheat. Sixteen shillings, therefore, was the price of two quarters and\r\n      more than three bushels of wheat. Valuing a quarter of wheat in the\r\n      present times at eight-and-twenty shillings, the real price of a yard of\r\n      fine cloth must, in those times, have been equal to at least three pounds\r\n      six shillings and sixpence of our present money. The man who bought it\r\n      must have parted with the command of a quantity of labour and subsistence\r\n      equal to what that sum would purchase in the present times.\r\n\r\n      The reduction in the real price of the coarse manufacture, though\r\n      considerable, has not been so great as in that of the fine.\r\n\r\n      In 1463, being the 3rd of Edward IV. it was enacted, that “no servant in\r\n      husbandry nor common labourer, nor servant to any artificer inhabiting out\r\n      of a city or burgh, shall use or wear in their clothing any cloth above\r\n      two shillings the broad yard.” In the 3rd of Edward IV., two shillings\r\n      contained very nearly the same quantity of silver as four of our present\r\n      money. But the Yorkshire cloth which is now sold at four shillings the\r\n      yard, is probably much superior to any that was then made for the wearing\r\n      of the very poorest order of common servants. Even the money price of\r\n      their clothing, therefore, may, in proportion to the quality, be somewhat\r\n      cheaper in the present than it was in those ancient times. The real price\r\n      is certainly a good deal cheaper. Tenpence was then reckoned what is\r\n      called the moderate and reasonable price of a bushel of wheat. Two\r\n      shillings, therefore, was the price of two bushels and near two pecks of\r\n      wheat, which in the present times, at three shillings and sixpence the\r\n      bushel, would be worth eight shillings and ninepence. For a yard of this\r\n      cloth the poor servant must have parted with the power of purchasing a\r\n      quantity of subsistence equal to what eight shillings and ninepence would\r\n      purchase in the present times. This is a sumptuary law, too, restraining\r\n      the luxury and extravagance of the poor. Their clothing, therefore, had\r\n      commonly been much more expensive.\r\n\r\n      The same order of people are, by the same law, prohibited from wearing\r\n      hose, of which the price should exceed fourteen-pence the pair, equal to\r\n      about eight-and-twenty pence of our present money. But fourteen-pence was\r\n      in those times the price of a bushel and near two pecks of wheat; which in\r\n      the present times, at three and sixpence the bushel, would cost five\r\n      shillings and threepence. We should in the present times consider this as\r\n      a very high price for a pair of stockings to a servant of the poorest and\r\n      lowest order. He must however, in those times, have paid what was really\r\n      equivalent to this price for them.\r\n\r\n      In the time of Edward IV. the art of knitting stockings was probably not\r\n      known in any part of Europe. Their hose were made of common cloth, which\r\n      may have been one of the causes of their dearness. The first person that\r\n      wore stockings in England is said to have been Queen Elizabeth. She\r\n      received them as a present from the Spanish ambassador.\r\n\r\n      Both in the coarse and in the fine woollen manufacture, the machinery\r\n      employed was much more imperfect in those ancient, than it is in the\r\n      present times. It has since received three very capital improvements,\r\n      besides, probably, many smaller ones, of which it may be difficult to\r\n      ascertain either the number or the importance. The three capital\r\n      improvements are, first, the exchange of the rock and spindle for the\r\n      spinning-wheel, which, with the same quantity of labour, will perform more\r\n      than double the quantity of work. Secondly, the use of several very\r\n      ingenious machines, which facilitate and abridge, in a still greater\r\n      proportion, the winding of the worsted and woollen yarn, or the proper\r\n      arrangement of the warp and woof before they are put into the loom; an\r\n      operation which, previous to the invention of those machines, must have\r\n      been extremely tedious and troublesome. Thirdly, the employment of the\r\n      fulling-mill for thickening the cloth, instead of treading it in water.\r\n      Neither wind nor water mills of any kind were known in England so early as\r\n      the beginning of the sixteenth century, nor, so far as I know, in any\r\n      other part of Europe north of the Alps. They had been introduced into\r\n      Italy some time before.\r\n\r\n      The consideration of these circumstances may, perhaps, in some measure,\r\n      explain to us why the real price both of the coarse and of the fine\r\n      manufacture was so much higher in those ancient than it is in the present\r\n      times. It cost a greater quantity of labour to bring the goods to market.\r\n      When they were brought thither, therefore, they must have purchased, or\r\n      exchanged for the price of, a greater quantity.\r\n\r\n      The coarse manufacture probably was, in those ancient times, carried on in\r\n      England in the same manner as it always has been in countries where arts\r\n      and manufactures are in their infancy. It was probably a household\r\n      manufacture, in which every different part of the work was occasionally\r\n      performed by all the different members of almost every private family, but\r\n      so as to be their work only when they had nothing else to do, and not to\r\n      be the principal business from which any of them derived the greater part\r\n      of their subsistence. The work which is performed in this manner, it has\r\n      already been observed, comes always much cheaper to market than that which\r\n      is the principal or sole fund of the workman’s subsistence. The fine\r\n      manufacture, on the other hand, was not, in those times, carried on in\r\n      England, but in the rich and commercial country of Flanders; and it was\r\n      probably conducted then, in the same manner as now, by people who derived\r\n      the whole, or the principal part of their subsistence from it. It was,\r\n      besides, a foreign manufacture, and must have paid some duty, the ancient\r\n      custom of tonnage and poundage at least, to the king. This duty, indeed,\r\n      would not probably be very great. It was not then the policy of Europe to\r\n      restrain, by high duties, the importation of foreign manufactures, but\r\n      rather to encourage it, in order that merchants might be enabled to\r\n      supply, at as easy a rate as possible, the great men with the\r\n      conveniencies and luxuries which they wanted, and which the industry of\r\n      their own country could not afford them.\r\n\r\n      The consideration of these circumstances may, perhaps, in some measure\r\n      explain to us why, in those ancient times, the real price of the coarse\r\n      manufacture was, in proportion to that of the fine, so much lower than in\r\n      the present times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Conclusion of the Chapter.\r\n\r\n      I shall conclude this very long chapter with observing, that every\r\n      improvement in the circumstances of the society tends, either directly or\r\n      indirectly, to raise the real rent of land to increase the real wealth of\r\n      the landlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the produce of the\r\n      labour of other people.\r\n\r\n      The extension of improvement and cultivation tends to raise it directly.\r\n      The landlord’s share of the produce necessarily increases with the\r\n      increase of the produce.\r\n\r\n      That rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land,\r\n      which is first the effect of the extended improvement and cultivation, and\r\n      afterwards the cause of their being still further extended, the rise in\r\n      the price of cattle, for example, tends, too, to raise the rent of land\r\n      directly, and in a still greater proportion. The real value of the\r\n      landlord’s share, his real command of the labour of other people, not only\r\n      rises with the real value of the produce, but the proportion of his share\r\n      to the whole produce rises with it.\r\n\r\n      That produce, after the rise in its real price, requires no more labour to\r\n      collect it than before. A smaller proportion of it will, therefore, be\r\n      sufficient to replace, with the ordinary profit, the stock which employs\r\n      that labour. A greater proportion of it must consequently belong to the\r\n      landlord.\r\n\r\n      All those improvements in the productive powers of labour, which tend\r\n      directly to reduce the rent price of manufactures, tend indirectly to\r\n      raise the real rent of land. The landlord exchanges that part of his rude\r\n      produce, which is over and above his own consumption, or, what comes to\r\n      the same thing, the price of that part of it, for manufactured produce.\r\n      Whatever reduces the real price of the latter, raises that of the former.\r\n      An equal quantity of the former becomes thereby equivalent to a greater\r\n      quantity of the latter; and the landlord is enabled to purchase a greater\r\n      quantity of the conveniencies, ornaments, or luxuries which he has\r\n      occasion for.\r\n\r\n      Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the\r\n      quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise\r\n      the real rent of land. A certain proportion of this labour naturally goes\r\n      to the land. A greater number of men and cattle are employed in its\r\n      cultivation, the produce increases with the increase of the stock which is\r\n      thus employed in raising it, and the rent increases with the produce.\r\n\r\n      The contrary circumstances, the neglect of cultivation and improvement,\r\n      the fall in the real price of any part of the rude produce of land, the\r\n      rise in the real price of manufactures from the decay of manufacturing art\r\n      and industry, the declension of the real wealth of the society, all tend,\r\n      on the other hand, to lower the real rent of land, to reduce the real\r\n      wealth of the landlord, to diminish his power of purchasing either the\r\n      labour, or the produce of the labour, of other people.\r\n\r\n      The whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, or, what\r\n      comes to the same thing, the whole price of that annual produce, naturally\r\n      divides itself, it has already been observed, into three parts; the rent\r\n      of land, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock; and constitutes a\r\n      revenue to three different orders of people; to those who live by rent, to\r\n      those who live by wages, and to those who live by profit. These are the\r\n      three great, original, and constituent, orders of every civilized society,\r\n      from whose revenue that of every other order is ultimately derived.\r\n\r\n      The interest of the first of those three great orders, it appears from\r\n      what has been just now said, is strictly and inseparably connected with\r\n      the general interest of the society. Whatever either promotes or obstructs\r\n      the one, necessarily promotes or obstructs the other. When the public\r\n      deliberates concerning any regulation of commerce or police, the\r\n      proprietors of land never can mislead it, with a view to promote the\r\n      interest of their own particular order; at least, if they have any\r\n      tolerable knowledge of that interest. They are, indeed, too often\r\n      defective in this tolerable knowledge. They are the only one of the three\r\n      orders whose revenue costs them neither labour nor care, but comes to\r\n      them, as it were, of its own accord, and independent of any plan or\r\n      project of their own. That indolence which is the natural effect of the\r\n      ease and security of their situation, renders them too often, not only\r\n      ignorant, but incapable of that application of mind, which is necessary in\r\n      order to foresee and understand the consequence of any public regulation.\r\n\r\n      The interest of the second order, that of those who live by wages, is as\r\n      strictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the first.\r\n      The wages of the labourer, it has already been shewn, are never so high as\r\n      when the demand for labour is continually rising, or when the quantity\r\n      employed is every year increasing considerably. When this real wealth of\r\n      the society becomes stationary, his wages are soon reduced to what is\r\n      barely enough to enable him to bring up a family, or to continue the race\r\n      of labourers. When the society declines, they fall even below this. The\r\n      order of proprietors may perhaps gain more by the prosperity of the\r\n      society than that of labourers; but there is no order that suffers so\r\n      cruelly from its decline. But though the interest of the labourer is\r\n      strictly connected with that of the society, he is incapable either of\r\n      comprehending that interest, or of understanding its connexion with his\r\n      own. His condition leaves him no time to receive the necessary\r\n      information, and his education and habits are commonly such as to render\r\n      him unfit to judge, even though he was fully informed. In the public\r\n      deliberations, therefore, his voice is little heard, and less regarded;\r\n      except upon particular occasions, when his clamour is animated, set on,\r\n      and supported by his employers, not for his, but their own particular\r\n      purposes.\r\n\r\n      His employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by\r\n      profit. It is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit, which\r\n      puts into motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society.\r\n      The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all\r\n      the most important operation of labour, and profit is the end proposed by\r\n      all those plans and projects. But the rate of profit does not, like rent\r\n      and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension of the\r\n      society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor\r\n      countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going\r\n      fastest to ruin. The interest of this third order, therefore, has not the\r\n      same connexion with the general interest of the society, as that of the\r\n      other two. Merchants and master manufacturers are, in this order, the two\r\n      classes of people who commonly employ the largest capitals, and who by\r\n      their wealth draw to themselves the greatest share of the public\r\n      consideration. As during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and\r\n      projects, they have frequently more acuteness of understanding than the\r\n      greater part of country gentlemen. As their thoughts, however, are\r\n      commonly exercised rather about the interest of their own particular\r\n      branch of business. than about that of the society, their judgment, even\r\n      when given with the greatest candour (which it has not been upon every\r\n      occasion), is much more to be depended upon with regard to the former of\r\n      those two objects, than with regard to the latter. Their superiority over\r\n      the country gentleman is, not so much in their knowledge of the public\r\n      interest, as in their having a better knowledge of their own interest than\r\n      he has of his. It is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that\r\n      they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to\r\n      give up both his own interest and that of the public, from a very simple\r\n      but honest conviction, that their interest, and not his, was the interest\r\n      of the public. The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular\r\n      branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different\r\n      from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market, and\r\n      to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen\r\n      the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the\r\n      public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can\r\n      only serve to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they\r\n      naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the\r\n      rest of their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation\r\n      of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to\r\n      with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having\r\n      been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but\r\n      with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men, whose\r\n      interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have\r\n      generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who\r\n      accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.\r\n\r\n      # PRICES OF WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\n  Year    Prices/Quarter  Average of different   Average prices of\r\n          in

THE NATURE, ACCUMULATION, AND EMPLOYMENT OF STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n      In that rude state of society, in which there is no division of labour, in\r\n      which exchanges are seldom made, and in which every man provides every\r\n      thing for himself, it is not necessary that any stock should be\r\n      accumulated, or stored up before-hand, in order to carry on the business\r\n      of the society. Every man endeavours to supply, by his own industry, his\r\n      own occasional wants, as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the\r\n      forest to hunt; when his coat is worn out, he clothes himself with the\r\n      skin of the first large animal he kills: and when his hut begins to go to\r\n      ruin, he repairs it, as well as he can, with the trees and the turf that\r\n      are nearest it.\r\n\r\n      But when the division of labour has once been thoroughly introduced, the\r\n      produce of a man’s own labour can supply but a very small part of his\r\n      occasional wants. The far greater part of them are supplied by the produce\r\n      of other men’s labour, which he purchases with the produce, or, what is\r\n      the same thing, with the price of the produce, of his own. But this\r\n      purchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own labour\r\n      has not only been completed, but sold. A stock of goods of different\r\n      kinds, therefore, must be stored up somewhere, sufficient to maintain him,\r\n      and to supply him with the materials and tools of his work, till such time\r\n      at least as both these events can be brought about. A weaver cannot apply\r\n      himself entirely to his peculiar business, unless there is before-hand\r\n      stored up somewhere, either in his own possession, or in that of some\r\n      other person, a stock sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with\r\n      the materials and tools of his work, till he has not only completed, but\r\n      sold his web. This accumulation must evidently be previous to his applying\r\n      his industry for so long a time to such a peculiar business.\r\n\r\n      As the accumulation of stock must, in the nature of things, be previous to\r\n      the division of labour, so labour can be more and more subdivided in\r\n      proportion only as stock is previously more and more accumulated. The\r\n      quantity of materials which the same number of people can work up,\r\n      increases in a great proportion as labour comes to be more and more\r\n      subdivided; and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to\r\n      a greater degree of simplicity, a variety of new machines come to be\r\n      invented for facilitating and abridging those operations. As the division\r\n      of labour advances, therefore, in order to give constant employment to an\r\n      equal number of workmen, an equal stock of provisions, and a greater stock\r\n      of materials and tools than what would have been necessary in a ruder\r\n      state of things, must be accumulated before-hand. But the number of\r\n      workmen in every branch of business generally increases with the division\r\n      of labour in that branch; or rather it is the increase of their number\r\n      which enables them to class and subdivide themselves in this manner.\r\n\r\n      As the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on this\r\n      great improvement in the productive powers of labour, so that accumulation\r\n      naturally leads to this improvement. The person who employs his stock in\r\n      maintaining labour, necessarily wishes to employ it in such a manner as to\r\n      produce as great a quantity of work as possible. He endeavours, therefore,\r\n      both to make among his workmen the most proper distribution of employment,\r\n      and to furnish them with the best machines which he can either invent or\r\n      afford to purchase. His abilities, in both these respects, are generally\r\n      in proportion to the extent of his stock, or to the number of people whom\r\n      it can employ. The quantity of industry, therefore, not only increases in\r\n      every country with the increase of the stock which employs it, but, in\r\n      consequence of that increase, the same quantity of industry produces a\r\n      much greater quantity of work.\r\n\r\n      Such are in general the effects of the increase of stock upon industry and\r\n      its productive powers.\r\n\r\n      In the following book, I have endeavoured to explain the nature of stock,\r\n      the effects of its accumulation into capital of different kinds, and the\r\n      effects of the different employments of those capitals. This book is\r\n      divided into five chapters. In the first chapter, I have endeavoured to\r\n      shew what are the different parts or branches into which the stock, either\r\n      of an individual, or of a great society, naturally divides itself. In the\r\n      second, I have endeavoured to explain the nature and operation of money,\r\n      considered as a particular branch of the general stock of the society. The\r\n      stock which is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the\r\n      person to whom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person. In the\r\n      third and fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the manner in\r\n      which it operates in both these situations. The fifth and last chapter\r\n      treats of the different effects which the different employments of capital\r\n      immediately produce upon the quantity, both of national industry, and of\r\n      the annual produce of land and labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOF THE DIVISION OF STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      When the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient to\r\n      maintain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving\r\n      any revenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and\r\n      endeavours, by his labour, to acquire something which may supply its place\r\n      before it be consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case, derived\r\n      from his labour only. This is the state of the greater part of the\r\n      labouring poor in all countries.\r\n\r\n      But when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or\r\n      years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part\r\n      of it, reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may\r\n      maintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock,\r\n      therefore, is distinguished into two parts. That part which he expects is\r\n      to afford him this revenue is called his capital. The other is that which\r\n      supplies his immediate consumption, and which consists either, first, in\r\n      that portion of his whole stock which was originally reserved for this\r\n      purpose; or, secondly, in his revenue, from whatever source derived, as it\r\n      gradually comes in; or, thirdly, in such things as had been purchased by\r\n      either of these in former years, and which are not yet entirely consumed,\r\n      such as a stock of clothes, household furniture, and the like. In one or\r\n      other, or all of these three articles, consists the stock which men\r\n      commonly reserve for their own immediate consumption.\r\n\r\n      There are two different ways in which a capital may be employed so as to\r\n      yield a revenue or profit to its employer.\r\n\r\n      First, it may be employed in raising, manufacturing, or purchasing goods,\r\n      and selling them again with a profit. The capital employed in this manner\r\n      yields no revenue or profit to its employer, while it either remains in\r\n      his possession, or continues in the same shape. The goods of the merchant\r\n      yield him no revenue or profit till he sells them for money, and the money\r\n      yields him as little till it is again exchanged for goods. His capital is\r\n      continually going from him in one shape, and returning to him in another;\r\n      and it is only by means of such circulation, or successive changes, that\r\n      it can yield him any profit. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly\r\n      be called circulating capitals.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, it may be employed in the improvement of land, in the purchase\r\n      of useful machines and instruments of trade, or in such like things as\r\n      yield a revenue or profit without changing masters, or circulating any\r\n      further. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called fixed\r\n      capitals.\r\n\r\n      Different occupations require very different proportions between the fixed\r\n      and circulating capitals employed in them.\r\n\r\n      The capital of a merchant, for example, is altogether a circulating\r\n      capital. He has occasion for no machines or instruments of trade, unless\r\n      his shop or warehouse be considered as such.\r\n\r\n      Some part of the capital of every master artificer or manufacturer must be\r\n      fixed in the instruments of his trade. This part, however, is very small\r\n      in some, and very great in others, A master tailor requires no other\r\n      instruments of trade but a parcel of needles. Those of the master\r\n      shoemaker are a little, though but a very little, more expensive. Those of\r\n      the weaver rise a good deal above those of the shoemaker. The far greater\r\n      part of the capital of all such master artificers, however, is circulated\r\n      either in the wages of their workmen, or in the price of their materials,\r\n      and repaid, with a profit, by the price of the work.\r\n\r\n      In other works a much greater fixed capital is required. In a great\r\n      iron-work, for example, the furnace for melting the ore, the forge, the\r\n      slit-mill, are instruments of trade which cannot be erected without a very\r\n      great expense. In coal works, and mines of every kind, the machinery\r\n      necessary, both for drawing out the water, and for other purposes, is\r\n      frequently still more expensive.\r\n\r\n      That part of the capital of the farmer which is employed in the\r\n      instruments of agriculture is a fixed, that which is employed in the wages\r\n      and maintenance of his labouring servants is a circulating capital. He\r\n      makes a profit of the one by keeping it in his own possession, and of the\r\n      other by parting with it. The price or value of his labouring cattle is a\r\n      fixed capital, in the same manner as that of the instruments of husbandry;\r\n      their maintenance is a circulating capital, in the same manner as that of\r\n      the labouring servants. The farmer makes his profit by keeping the\r\n      labouring cattle, and by parting with their maintenance. Both the price\r\n      and the maintenance of the cattle which are bought in and fattened, not\r\n      for labour, but for sale, are a circulating capital. The farmer makes his\r\n      profit by parting with them. A flock of sheep or a herd of cattle, that,\r\n      in a breeding country, is brought in neither for labour nor for sale, but\r\n      in order to make a profit by their wool, by their milk, and by their\r\n      increase, is a fixed capital. The profit is made by keeping them. Their\r\n      maintenance is a circulating capital. The profit is made by parting with\r\n      it; and it comes back with both its own profit and the profit upon the\r\n      whole price of the cattle, in the price of the wool, the milk, and the\r\n      increase. The whole value of the seed, too, is properly a fixed capital.\r\n      Though it goes backwards and forwards between the ground and the granary,\r\n      it never changes masters, and therefore does not properly circulate. The\r\n      farmer makes his profit, not by its sale, but by its increase.\r\n\r\n      The general stock of any country or society is the same with that of all\r\n      its inhabitants or members; and, therefore, naturally divides itself into\r\n      the same three portions, each of which has a distinct function or office.\r\n\r\n      The first is that portion which is reserved for immediate consumption, and\r\n      of which the characteristic is, that it affords no revenue or profit. It\r\n      consists in the stock of food, clothes, household furniture, etc. which\r\n      have been purchased by their proper consumers, but which are not yet\r\n      entirely consumed. The whole stock of mere dwelling-houses, too,\r\n      subsisting at any one time in the country, make a part of this first\r\n      portion. The stock that is laid out in a house, if it is to be the\r\n      dwelling-house of the proprietor, ceases from that moment to serve in the\r\n      function of a capital, or to afford any revenue to its owner. A\r\n      dwelling-house, as such, contributes nothing to the revenue of its\r\n      inhabitant; and though it is, no doubt, extremely useful to him, it is as\r\n      his clothes and household furniture are useful to him, which, however,\r\n      make a part of his expense, and not of his revenue. If it is to be let to\r\n      a tenant for rent, as the house itself can produce nothing, the tenant\r\n      must always pay the rent out of some other revenue, which he derives,\r\n      either from labour, or stock, or land. Though a house, therefore, may\r\n      yield a revenue to its proprietor, and thereby serve in the function of a\r\n      capital to him, it cannot yield any to the public, nor serve in the\r\n      function of a capital to it, and the revenue of the whole body of the\r\n      people can never be in the smallest degree increased by it. Clothes and\r\n      household furniture, in the same manner, sometimes yield a revenue, and\r\n      thereby serve in the function of a capital to particular persons. In\r\n      countries where masquerades are common, it is a trade to let out\r\n      masquerade dresses for a night. Upholsterers frequently let furniture by\r\n      the month or by the year. Undertakers let the furniture of funerals by the\r\n      day and by the week. Many people let furnished houses, and get a rent, not\r\n      only for the use of the house, but for that of the furniture. The revenue,\r\n      however, which is derived from such things, must always be ultimately\r\n      drawn from some other source of revenue. Of all parts of the stock, either\r\n      of an individual or of a society, reserved for immediate consumption, what\r\n      is laid out in houses is most slowly consumed. A stock of clothes may last\r\n      several years; a stock of furniture half a century or a century; but a\r\n      stock of houses, well built and properly taken care of, may last many\r\n      centuries. Though the period of their total consumption, however, is more\r\n      distant, they are still as really a stock reserved for immediate\r\n      consumption as either clothes or household furniture.\r\n\r\n      The second of the three portions into which the general stock of the\r\n      society divides itself, is the fixed capital; of which the characteristic\r\n      is, that it affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing\r\n      masters. It consists chiefly of the four following articles.\r\n\r\n      First, of all useful machines and instruments of trade, which facilitate\r\n      and abridge labour.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, of all those profitable buildings which are the means of\r\n      procuring a revenue, not only to the proprietor who lets them for a rent,\r\n      but to the person who possesses them, and pays that rent for them; such as\r\n      shops, warehouses, work-houses, farm-houses, with all their necessary\r\n      buildings, stables, granaries, etc. These are very different from mere\r\n      dwelling-houses. They are a sort of instruments of trade, and may be\r\n      considered in the same light.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, of the improvements of land, of what has been profitably laid out\r\n      in clearing, draining, inclosing, manuring, and reducing it into the\r\n      condition most proper for tillage and culture. An improved farm may very\r\n      justly be regarded in the same light as those useful machines which\r\n      facilitate and abridge labour, and by means of which an equal circulating\r\n      capital can afford a much greater revenue to its employer. An improved\r\n      farm is equally advantageous and more durable than any of those machines,\r\n      frequently requiring no other repairs than the most profitable application\r\n      of the farmer’s capital employed in cultivating it.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants and\r\n      members of the society. The acquisition of such talents, by the\r\n      maintenance of the acquirer during his education, study, or\r\n      apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a capital fixed and\r\n      realized, as it were, in his person. Those talents, as they make a part of\r\n      his fortune, so do they likewise that of the society to which he belongs.\r\n      The improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as\r\n      a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labour,\r\n      and which, though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with a\r\n      profit.\r\n\r\n      The third and last of the three portions into which the general stock of\r\n      the society naturally divides itself, is the circulating capital, of which\r\n      the characteristic is, that it affords a revenue only by circulating or\r\n      changing masters. It is composed likewise of four parts.\r\n\r\n      First, of the money, by means of which all the other three are circulated\r\n      and distributed to their proper consumers.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, of the stock of provisions which are in the possession of the\r\n      butcher, the grazier, the farmer, the corn-merchant, the brewer, etc. and\r\n      from the sale of which they expect to derive a profit.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, of the materials, whether altogether rude, or more or less\r\n      manufactured, of clothes, furniture, and building which are not yet made\r\n      up into any of those three shapes, but which remain in the hands of the\r\n      growers, the manufacturers, the mercers, and drapers, the\r\n      timber-merchants, the carpenters and joiners, the brick-makers, etc.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, and lastly, of the work which is made up and completed, but\r\n      which is still in the hands of the merchant and manufacturer, and not yet\r\n      disposed of or distributed to the proper consumers; such as the finished\r\n      work which we frequently find ready made in the shops of the smith, the\r\n      cabinet-maker, the goldsmith, the jeweller, the china-merchant, etc. The\r\n      circulating capital consists, in this manner, of the provisions,\r\n      materials, and finished work of all kinds that are in the hands of their\r\n      respective dealers, and of the money that is necessary for circulating and\r\n      distributing them to those who are finally to use or to consume them.\r\n\r\n      Of these four parts, three—provisions, materials, and finished work,\r\n      are either annually or in a longer or shorter period, regularly withdrawn\r\n      from it, and placed either in the fixed capital, or in the stock reserved\r\n      for immediate consumption.\r\n\r\n      Every fixed capital is both originally derived from, and requires to be\r\n      continually supported by, a circulating capital. All useful machines and\r\n      instruments of trade are originally derived from a circulating capital,\r\n      which furnishes the materials of which they are made, and the maintenance\r\n      of the workmen who make them. They require, too, a capital of the same\r\n      kind to keep them in constant repair.\r\n\r\n      No fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating\r\n      capital. The most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce\r\n      nothing, without the circulating capital, which affords the materials they\r\n      are employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ them.\r\n      Land, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circulating\r\n      capital, which maintains the labourers who cultivate and collect its\r\n      produce.\r\n\r\n      To maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for immediate\r\n      consumption, is the sole end and purpose both of the fixed and circulating\r\n      capitals. It is this stock which feeds, clothes, and lodges the people.\r\n      Their riches or poverty depend upon the abundant or sparing supplies which\r\n      those two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for immediate\r\n      consumption.\r\n\r\n      So great a part of the circulating capital being continually withdrawn\r\n      from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general\r\n      stock of the society, it must in its turn require continual supplies\r\n      without which it would soon cease to exist. These supplies are principally\r\n      drawn from three sources; the produce of land, of mines, and of fisheries.\r\n      These afford continual supplies of provisions and materials, of which part\r\n      is afterwards wrought up into finished work and by which are replaced the\r\n      provisions, materials, and finished work, continually withdrawn from the\r\n      circulating capital. From mines, too, is drawn what is necessary for\r\n      maintaining and augmenting that part of it which consists in money. For\r\n      though, in the ordinary course of business, this part is not, like the\r\n      other three, necessarily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the\r\n      other two branches of the general stock of the society, it must, however,\r\n      like all other things, be wasted and worn out at last, and sometimes, too,\r\n      be either lost or sent abroad, and must, therefore, require continual,\r\n      though no doubt much smaller supplies.\r\n\r\n      Land, mines, and fisheries, require all both a fixed and circulating\r\n      capital to cultivate them; and their produce replaces, with a profit not\r\n      only those capitals, but all the others in the society. Thus the farmer\r\n      annually replaces to the manufacturer the provisions which he had\r\n      consumed, and the materials which he had wrought up the year before; and\r\n      the manufacturer replaces to the farmer the finished work which he had\r\n      wasted and worn out in the same time. This is the real exchange that is\r\n      annually made between those two orders of people, though it seldom happens\r\n      that the rude produce of the one, and the manufactured produce of the\r\n      other, are directly bartered for one another; because it seldom happens\r\n      that the farmer sells his corn and his cattle, his flax and his wool, to\r\n      the very same person of whom he chuses to purchase the clothes, furniture,\r\n      and instruments of trade, which he wants. He sells, therefore, his rude\r\n      produce for money, with which he can purchase, wherever it is to be had,\r\n      the manufactured produce he has occasion for. Land even replaces, in part\r\n      at least, the capitals with which fisheries and mines are cultivated. It\r\n      is the produce of land which draws the fish from the waters; and it is the\r\n      produce of the surface of the earth which extracts the minerals from its\r\n      bowels.\r\n\r\n      The produce of land, mines, and fisheries, when their natural fertility is\r\n      equal, is in proportion to the extent and proper application of the\r\n      capitals employed about them. When the capitals are equal, and equally\r\n      well applied, it is in proportion to their natural fertility.\r\n\r\n      In all countries where there is a tolerable security, every man of common\r\n      understanding will endeavour to employ whatever stock he can command, in\r\n      procuring either present enjoyment or future profit. If it is employed in\r\n      procuring present enjoyment, it is a stock reserved for immediate\r\n      consumption. If it is employed in procuring future profit, it must procure\r\n      this profit either by staying with him, or by going from him. In the one\r\n      case it is a fixed, in the other it is a circulating capital. A man must\r\n      be perfectly crazy, who, where there is a tolerable security, does not\r\n      employ all the stock which he commands, whether it be his own, or borrowed\r\n      of other people, in some one or other of those three ways.\r\n\r\n      In those unfortunate countries, indeed, where men are continually afraid\r\n      of the violence of their superiors, they frequently bury or conceal a\r\n      great part of their stock, in order to have it always at hand to carry\r\n      with them to some place of safety, in case of their being threatened with\r\n      any of those disasters to which they consider themselves at all times\r\n      exposed. This is said to be a common practice in Turkey, in Indostan, and,\r\n      I believe, in most other governments of Asia. It seems to have been a\r\n      common practice among our ancestors during the violence of the feudal\r\n      government. Treasure-trove was, in those times, considered as no\r\n      contemptible part of the revenue of the greatest sovereigns in Europe. It\r\n      consisted in such treasure as was found concealed in the earth, and to\r\n      which no particular person could prove any right. This was regarded, in\r\n      those times, as so important an object, that it was always considered as\r\n      belonging to the sovereign, and neither to the finder nor to the\r\n      proprietor of the land, unless the right to it had been conveyed to the\r\n      latter by an express clause in his charter. It was put upon the same\r\n      footing with gold and silver mines, which, without a special clause in the\r\n      charter, were never supposed to be comprehended in the general grant of\r\n      the lands, though mines of lead, copper, tin, and coal were, as things of\r\n      smaller consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nOF MONEY, CONSIDERED AS A PARTICULAR\r\nBRANCH OF THE GENERAL STOCK OF THE SOCIETY, OR OF THE EXPENSE OF MAINTAINING\r\nTHE NATIONAL CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      It has been shown in the First Book, that the price of the greater part of\r\n      commodities resolves itself into three parts, of which one pays the wages\r\n      of the labour, another the profits of the stock, and a third the rent of\r\n      the land which had been employed in producing and bringing them to market:\r\n      that there are, indeed, some commodities of which the price is made up of\r\n      two of those parts only, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock;\r\n      and a very few in which it consists altogether in one, the wages of\r\n      labour; but that the price of every commodity necessarily resolves itself\r\n      into some one or other, or all, of those three parts; every part of it\r\n      which goes neither to rent nor to wages, being necessarily profit to some\r\n      body.\r\n\r\n      Since this is the case, it has been observed, with regard to every\r\n      particular commodity, taken separately, it must be so with regard to all\r\n      the commodities which compose the whole annual produce of the land and\r\n      labour of every country, taken complexly. The whole price or exchangeable\r\n      value of that annual produce must resolve itself into the same three\r\n      parts, and be parcelled out among the different inhabitants of the\r\n      country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their stock,\r\n      or the rent of their land.\r\n\r\n      But though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and labour of\r\n      every country, is thus divided among, and constitutes a revenue to, its\r\n      different inhabitants; yet, as in the rent of a private estate, we\r\n      distinguish between the gross rent and the neat rent, so may we likewise\r\n      in the revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country.\r\n\r\n      The gross rent of a private estate comprehends whatever is paid by the\r\n      farmer; the neat rent, what remains free to the landlord, after deducting\r\n      the expense of management, of repairs, and all other necessary charges; or\r\n      what, without hurting his estate, he can afford to place in his stock\r\n      reserved for immediate consumption, or to spend upon his table, equipage,\r\n      the ornaments of his house and furniture, his private enjoyments and\r\n      amusements. His real wealth is in proportion, not to his gross, but to his\r\n      neat rent.\r\n\r\n      The gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country comprehends\r\n      the whole annual produce of their land and labour; the neat revenue, what\r\n      remains free to them, after deducting the expense of maintaining first,\r\n      their fixed, and, secondly, their circulating capital, or what, without\r\n      encroaching upon their capital, they can place in their stock reserved for\r\n      immediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniencies, and\r\n      amusements. Their real wealth, too, is in proportion, not to their gross,\r\n      but to their neat revenue.\r\n\r\n      The whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital must evidently be\r\n      excluded from the neat revenue of the society. Neither the materials\r\n      necessary for supporting their useful machines and instruments of trade,\r\n      their profitable buildings, etc. nor the produce of the labour necessary\r\n      for fashioning those materials into the proper form, can ever make any\r\n      part of it. The price of that labour may indeed make a part of it; as the\r\n      workmen so employed may place the whole value of their wages in their\r\n      stock reserved for immediate consumption. But in other sorts of labour,\r\n      both the price and the produce go to this stock; the price to that of the\r\n      workmen, the produce to that of other people, whose subsistence,\r\n      conveniencies, and amusements, are augmented by the labour of those\r\n      workmen.\r\n\r\n      The intention of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers of\r\n      labour, or to enable the same number of labourers to perform a much\r\n      greater quantity of work. In a farm where all the necessary buildings,\r\n      fences, drains, communications, etc. are in the most perfect good order,\r\n      the same number of labourers and labouring cattle will raise a much\r\n      greater produce, than in one of equal extent and equally good ground, but\r\n      not furnished with equal conveniencies. In manufactures, the same number\r\n      of hands, assisted with the best machinery, will work up a much greater\r\n      quantity of goods than with more imperfect instruments of trade. The\r\n      expense which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of any kind, is\r\n      always repaid with great profit, and increases the annual produce by a\r\n      much greater value than that of the support which such improvements\r\n      require. This support, however, still requires a certain portion of that\r\n      produce. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour of a certain\r\n      number of workmen, both of which might have been immediately employed to\r\n      augment the food, clothing, and lodging, the subsistence and conveniencies\r\n      of the society, are thus diverted to another employment, highly\r\n      advantageous indeed, but still different from this one. It is upon this\r\n      account that all such improvements in mechanics, as enable the same number\r\n      of workmen to perform an equal quantity of work with cheaper and simpler\r\n      machinery than had been usual before, are always regarded as advantageous\r\n      to every society. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour of a\r\n      certain number of workmen, which had before been employed in supporting a\r\n      more complex and expensive machinery, can afterwards be applied to augment\r\n      the quantity of work which that or any other machinery is useful only for\r\n      performing. The undertaker of some great manufactory, who employs a\r\n      thousand a-year in the maintenance of his machinery, if he can reduce this\r\n      expense to five hundred, will naturally employ the other five hundred in\r\n      purchasing an additional quantity of materials, to be wrought up by an\r\n      additional number of workmen. The quantity of that work, therefore, which\r\n      his machinery was useful only for performing, will naturally be augmented,\r\n      and with it all the advantage and conveniency which the society can derive\r\n      from that work.\r\n\r\n      The expense of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country, may very\r\n      properly be compared to that of repairs in a private estate. The expense\r\n      of repairs may frequently be necessary for supporting the produce of the\r\n      estate, and consequently both the gross and the neat rent of the landlord.\r\n      When by a more proper direction, however, it can be diminished without\r\n      occasioning any diminution of produce, the gross rent remains at least the\r\n      same as before, and the neat rent is necessarily augmented.\r\n\r\n      But though the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital is thus\r\n      necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society, it is not the\r\n      same case with that of maintaining the circulating capital. Of the four\r\n      parts of which this latter capital is composed, money, provisions,\r\n      materials, and finished work, the three last, it has already been\r\n      observed, are regularly withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed\r\n      capital of the society, or in their stock reserved for immediate\r\n      consumption. Whatever portion of those consumable goods is not employed in\r\n      maintaining the former, goes all to the latter, and makes a part of the\r\n      neat revenue of the society. The maintenance of those three parts of the\r\n      circulating capital, therefore, withdraws no portion of the annual produce\r\n      from the neat revenue of the society, besides what is necessary for\r\n      maintaining the fixed capital.\r\n\r\n      The circulating capital of a society is in this respect different from\r\n      that of an individual. That of an individual is totally excluded from\r\n      making any part of his neat revenue, which must consist altogether in his\r\n      profits. But though the circulating capital of every individual makes a\r\n      part of that of the society to which he belongs, it is not upon that\r\n      account totally excluded from making a part likewise of their neat\r\n      revenue. Though the whole goods in a merchant’s shop must by no means be\r\n      placed in his own stock reserved for immediate consumption, they may in\r\n      that of other people, who, from a revenue derived from other funds, may\r\n      regularly replace their value to him, together with its profits, without\r\n      occasioning any diminution either of his capital or of theirs.\r\n\r\n      Money, therefore, is the only part of the circulating capital of a\r\n      society, of which the maintenance can occasion any diminution in their\r\n      neat revenue.\r\n\r\n      The fixed capital, and that part of the circulating capital which consists\r\n      in money, so far as they affect the revenue of the society, bear a very\r\n      great resemblance to one another.\r\n\r\n      First, as those machines and instruments of trade, etc. require a certain\r\n      expense, first to erect them, and afterwards to support them, both which\r\n      expenses, though they make a part of the gross, are deductions from the\r\n      neat revenue of the society; so the stock of money which circulates in any\r\n      country must require a certain expense, first to collect it, and\r\n      afterwards to support it; both which expenses, though they make a part of\r\n      the gross, are, in the same manner, deductions from the neat revenue of\r\n      the society. A certain quantity of very valuable materials, gold and\r\n      silver, and of very curious labour, instead of augmenting the stock\r\n      reserved for immediate consumption, the subsistence, conveniencies, and\r\n      amusements of individuals, is employed in supporting that great but\r\n      expensive instrument of commerce, by means of which every individual in\r\n      the society has his subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements, regularly\r\n      distributed to him in their proper proportions.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, as the machines and instruments of trade, etc. which compose the\r\n      fixed capital either of an individual or of a society, make no part either\r\n      of the gross or of the neat revenue of either; so money, by means of which\r\n      the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among all its\r\n      different members, makes itself no part of that revenue. The great wheel\r\n      of circulation is altogether different from the goods which are circulated\r\n      by means of it. The revenue of the society consists altogether in those\r\n      goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them. In computing either the\r\n      gross or the neat revenue of any society, we must always, from the whole\r\n      annual circulation of money and goods, deduct the whole value of the\r\n      money, of which not a single farthing can ever make any part of either.\r\n\r\n      It is the ambiguity of language only which can make this proposition\r\n      appear either doubtful or paradoxical. When properly explained and\r\n      understood, it is almost self-evident.\r\n\r\n      When we talk of any particular sum of money, we sometimes mean nothing but\r\n      the metal pieces of which it is composed, and sometimes we include in our\r\n      meaning some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in exchange\r\n      for it, or to the power of purchasing which the possession of it conveys.\r\n      Thus, when we say that the circulating money of England has been computed\r\n      at eighteen millions, we mean only to express the amount of the metal\r\n      pieces, which some writers have computed, or rather have supposed, to\r\n      circulate in that country. But when we say that a man is worth fifty or a\r\n      hundred pounds a-year, we mean commonly to express, not only the amount of\r\n      the metal pieces which are annually paid to him, but the value of the\r\n      goods which he can annually purchase or consume; we mean commonly to\r\n      ascertain what is or ought to be his way of living, or the quantity and\r\n      quality of the necessaries and conveniencies of life in which he can with\r\n      propriety indulge himself.\r\n\r\n      When, by any particular sum of money, we mean not only to express the\r\n      amount of the metal pieces of which it is composed, but to include in its\r\n      signification some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in\r\n      exchange for them, the wealth or revenue which it in this case denotes, is\r\n      equal only to one of the two values which are thus intimated somewhat\r\n      ambiguously by the same word, and to the latter more properly than to the\r\n      former, to the money’s worth more properly than to the money.\r\n\r\n      Thus, if a guinea be the weekly pension of a particular person, he can in\r\n      the course of the week purchase with it a certain quantity of subsistence,\r\n      conveniencies, and amusements. In proportion as this quantity is great or\r\n      small, so are his real riches, his real weekly revenue. His weekly revenue\r\n      is certainly not equal both to the guinea and to what can be purchased\r\n      with it, but only to one or other of those two equal values, and to the\r\n      latter more properly than to the former, to the guinea’s worth rather than\r\n      to the guinea.\r\n\r\n      If the pension of such a person was paid to him, not in gold, but in a\r\n      weekly bill for a guinea, his revenue surely would not so properly consist\r\n      in the piece of paper, as in what he could get for it. A guinea may be\r\n      considered as a bill for a certain quantity of necessaries and\r\n      conveniencies upon all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood. The revenue of\r\n      the person to whom it is paid, does not so properly consist in the piece\r\n      of gold, as in what he can get for it, or in what he can exchange it for.\r\n      If it could be exchanged for nothing, it would, like a bill upon a\r\n      bankrupt, be of no more value than the most useless piece of paper.\r\n\r\n      Though the weekly or yearly revenue of all the different inhabitants of\r\n      any country, in the same manner, may be, and in reality frequently is,\r\n      paid to them in money, their real riches, however, the real weekly or\r\n      yearly revenue of all of them taken together, must always be great or\r\n      small, in proportion to the quantity of consumable goods which they can\r\n      all of them purchase with this money. The whole revenue of all of them\r\n      taken together is evidently not equal to both the money and the consumable\r\n      goods, but only to one or other of those two values, and to the latter\r\n      more properly than to the former.\r\n\r\n      Though we frequently, therefore, express a person’s revenue by the metal\r\n      pieces which are annually paid to him, it is because the amount of those\r\n      pieces regulates the extent of his power of purchasing, or the value of\r\n      the goods which he can annually afford to consume. We still consider his\r\n      revenue as consisting in this power of purchasing or consuming, and not in\r\n      the pieces which convey it.\r\n\r\n      But if this is sufficiently evident, even with regard to an individual, it\r\n      is still more so with regard to a society. The amount of the metal pieces\r\n      which are annually paid to an individual, is often precisely equal to his\r\n      revenue, and is upon that account the shortest and best expression of its\r\n      value. But the amount of the metal pieces which circulate in a society,\r\n      can never be equal to the revenue of all its members. As the same guinea\r\n      which pays the weekly pension of one man to-day, may pay that of another\r\n      to-morrow, and that of a third the day thereafter, the amount of the metal\r\n      pieces which annually circulate in any country, must always be of much\r\n      less value than the whole money pensions annually paid with them. But the\r\n      power of purchasing, or the goods which can successively be bought with\r\n      the whole of those money pensions, as they are successively paid, must\r\n      always be precisely of the same value with those pensions; as must\r\n      likewise be the revenue of the different persons to whom they are paid.\r\n      That revenue, therefore, cannot consist in those metal pieces, of which\r\n      the amount is so much inferior to its value, but in the power of\r\n      purchasing, in the goods which can successively be bought with them as\r\n      they circulate from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n      Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great instrument of\r\n      commerce, like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a part, and\r\n      a very valuable part, of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of the\r\n      society to which it belongs; and though the metal pieces of which it is\r\n      composed, in the course of their annual circulation, distribute to every\r\n      man the revenue which properly belongs to him, they make themselves no\r\n      part of that revenue.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, and lastly, the machines and instruments of trade, etc. which\r\n      compose the fixed capital, bear this further resemblance to that part of\r\n      the circulating capital which consists in money; that as every saving in\r\n      the expense of erecting and supporting those machines, which does not\r\n      diminish the introductive powers of labour, is an improvement of the neat\r\n      revenue of the society; so every saving in the expense of collecting and\r\n      supporting that part of the circulating capital which consists in money is\r\n      an improvement of exactly the same kind.\r\n\r\n      It is sufficiently obvious, and it has partly, too, been explained\r\n      already, in what manner every saving in the expense of supporting the\r\n      fixed capital is an improvement of the neat revenue of the society. The\r\n      whole capital of the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided\r\n      between his fixed and his circulating capital. While his whole capital\r\n      remains the same, the smaller the one part, the greater must necessarily\r\n      be the other. It is the circulating capital which furnishes the materials\r\n      and wages of labour, and puts industry into motion. Every saving,\r\n      therefore, in the expense of maintaining the fixed capital, which does not\r\n      diminish the productive powers of labour, must increase the fund which\r\n      puts industry into motion, and consequently the annual produce of land and\r\n      labour, the real revenue of every society.\r\n\r\n      The substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money, replaces a\r\n      very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and\r\n      sometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be carried on by a new\r\n      wheel, which it costs less both to erect and to maintain than the old one.\r\n      But in what manner this operation is performed, and in what manner it\r\n      tends to increase either the gross or the neat revenue of the society, is\r\n      not altogether so obvious, and may therefore require some further\r\n      explication.\r\n\r\n      There are several different sorts of paper money; but the circulating\r\n      notes of banks and bankers are the species which is best known, and which\r\n      seems best adapted for this purpose.\r\n\r\n      When the people of any particular country have such confidence in the\r\n      fortune, probity and prudence of a particular banker, as to believe that\r\n      he is always ready to pay upon demand such of his promissory notes as are\r\n      likely to be at any time presented to him, those notes come to have the\r\n      same currency as gold and silver money, from the confidence that such\r\n      money can at any time be had for them.\r\n\r\n      A particular banker lends among his customers his own promissory notes,\r\n      to the extent, we shall suppose, of a hundred thousand pounds. As those\r\n      notes serve all the purposes of money, his debtors pay him the same\r\n      interest as if he had lent them so much money. This interest is the\r\n      source of his gain. Though some of those notes are continually coming\r\n      back upon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months\r\n      and years together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore,\r\n      notes to the extent of a hundred thousand pounds, twenty thousand pounds\r\n      in gold and silver may, frequently, be a sufficient provision for\r\n      answering occasional demands. By this operation, therefore, twenty\r\n      thousand pounds in gold and silver perform all the functions which a\r\n      hundred thousand could otherwise have performed. The same exchanges may\r\n      be made, the same quantity of consumable goods may be circulated and\r\n      distributed to their proper consumers, by means of his promissory notes,\r\n      to the value of a hundred thousand pounds, as by an equal value of gold\r\n      and silver money. Eighty thousand pounds of gold and silver, therefore,\r\n      can in this manner be spared from the circulation of the country; and if\r\n      different operations of the same kind should, at the same time, be\r\n      carried on by many different banks and bankers, the whole circulation may\r\n      thus be conducted with a fifth part only of the gold and silver which\r\n      would otherwise have been requisite.\r\n\r\n      Let us suppose, for example, that the whole circulating money of some\r\n      particular country amounted, at a particular time, to one million\r\n      sterling, that sum being then sufficient for circulating the whole annual\r\n      produce of their land and labour; let us suppose, too, that some time\r\n      thereafter, different banks and bankers issued promissory notes payable to\r\n      the bearer, to the extent of one million, reserving in their different\r\n      coffers two hundred thousand pounds for answering occasional demands;\r\n      there would remain, therefore, in circulation, eight hundred thousand\r\n      pounds in gold and silver, and a million of bank notes, or eighteen\r\n      hundred thousand pounds of paper and money together. But the annual\r\n      produce of the land and labour of the country had before required only one\r\n      million to circulate and distribute it to its proper consumers, and that\r\n      annual produce cannot be immediately augmented by those operations of\r\n      banking. One million, therefore, will be sufficient to circulate it after\r\n      them. The goods to be bought and sold being precisely the same as before,\r\n      the same quantity of money will be sufficient for buying and selling them.\r\n      The channel of circulation, if I may be allowed such an expression, will\r\n      remain precisely the same as before. One million we have supposed\r\n      sufficient to fill that channel. Whatever, therefore, is poured into it\r\n      beyond this sum, cannot run into it, but must overflow. One million eight\r\n      hundred thousand pounds are poured into it. Eight hundred thousand pounds,\r\n      therefore, must overflow, that sum being over and above what can be\r\n      employed in the circulation of the country. But though this sum cannot be\r\n      employed at home, it is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle. It will,\r\n      therefore, be sent abroad, in order to seek that profitable employment\r\n      which it cannot find at home. But the paper cannot go abroad; because at a\r\n      distance from the banks which issue it, and from the country in which\r\n      payment of it can be exacted by law, it will not be received in common\r\n      payments. Gold and silver, therefore, to the amount of eight hundred\r\n      thousand pounds, will be sent abroad, and the channel of home circulation\r\n      will remain filled with a million of paper instead of a million of those\r\n      metals which filled it before.\r\n\r\n      But though so great a quantity of gold and silver is thus sent abroad, we\r\n      must not imagine that it is sent abroad for nothing, or that its\r\n      proprietors make a present of it to foreign nations. They will exchange it\r\n      for foreign goods of some kind or another, in order to supply the\r\n      consumption either of some other foreign country, or of their own.\r\n\r\n      If they employ it in purchasing goods in one foreign country, in order to\r\n      supply the consumption of another, or in what is called the carrying\r\n      trade, whatever profit they make will be in addition to the neat revenue\r\n      of their own country. It is like a new fund, created for carrying on a new\r\n      trade; domestic business being now transacted by paper, and the gold and\r\n      silver being converted into a fund for this new trade.\r\n\r\n      If they employ it in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, they\r\n      may either, first, purchase such goods as are likely to be consumed by\r\n      idle people, who produce nothing, such as foreign wines, foreign silks,\r\n      etc.; or, secondly, they may purchase an additional stock of materials,\r\n      tools, and provisions, in order to maintain and employ an additional\r\n      number of industrious people, who reproduce, with a profit, the value of\r\n      their annual consumption.\r\n\r\n      So far as it is employed in the first way, it promotes prodigality,\r\n      increases expense and consumption, without increasing production, or\r\n      establishing any permanent fund for supporting that expense, and is in\r\n      every respect hurtful to the society.\r\n\r\n      So far as it is employed in the second way, it promotes industry; and\r\n      though it increases the consumption of the society, it provides a\r\n      permanent fund for supporting that consumption; the people who consume\r\n      reproducing, with a profit, the whole value of their annual consumption.\r\n      The gross revenue of the society, the annual produce of their land and\r\n      labour, is increased by the whole value which the labour of those workmen\r\n      adds to the materials upon which they are employed, and their neat revenue\r\n      by what remains of this value, after deducting what is necessary for\r\n      supporting the tools and instruments of their trade.\r\n\r\n      That the greater part of the gold and silver which being forced abroad by\r\n      those operations of banking, is employed in purchasing foreign goods for\r\n      home consumption, is, and must be, employed in purchasing those of this\r\n      second kind, seems not only probable, but almost unavoidable. Though some\r\n      particular men may sometimes increase their expense very considerably,\r\n      though their revenue does not increase at all, we maybe assured that no\r\n      class or order of men ever does so; because, though the principles of\r\n      common prudence do not always govern the conduct of every individual, they\r\n      always influence that of the majority of every class or order. But the\r\n      revenue of idle people, considered as a class or order, cannot, in the\r\n      smallest degree, be increased by those operations of banking. Their\r\n      expense in general, therefore, cannot be much increased by them, though\r\n      that of a few individuals among them may, and in reality sometimes is. The\r\n      demand of idle people, therefore, for foreign goods, being the same, or\r\n      very nearly the same as before, a very small part of the money which,\r\n      being forced abroad by those operations of banking, is employed in\r\n      purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, is likely to be employed in\r\n      purchasing those for their use. The greater part of it will naturally be\r\n      destined for the employment of industry, and not for the maintenance of\r\n      idleness.\r\n\r\n      When we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating capital of\r\n      any society can employ, we must always have regard to those parts of it\r\n      only which consist in provisions, materials, and finished work; the other,\r\n      which consists in money, and which serves only to circulate those three,\r\n      must always be deducted. In order to put industry into motion, three\r\n      things are requisite; materials to work upon, tools to work with, and the\r\n      wages or recompence for the sake of which the work is done. Money is\r\n      neither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with; and though the\r\n      wages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money, his real revenue,\r\n      like that of all other men, consists, not in the money, but in the money’s\r\n      worth; not in the metal pieces, but in what can be got for them.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of industry which any capital can employ, must evidently be\r\n      equal to the number of workmen whom it can supply with materials, tools,\r\n      and a maintenance suitable to the nature of the work. Money may be\r\n      requisite for purchasing the materials and tools of the work, as well as\r\n      the maintenance of the workmen; but the quantity of industry which the\r\n      whole capital can employ, is certainly not equal both to the money which\r\n      purchases, and to the materials, tools, and maintenance, which are\r\n      purchased with it, but only to one or other of those two values, and to\r\n      the latter more properly than to the former.\r\n\r\n      When paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money, the\r\n      quantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole\r\n      circulating capital can supply, may be increased by the whole value of\r\n      gold and silver which used to be employed in purchasing them. The whole\r\n      value of the great wheel of circulation and distribution is added to the\r\n      goods which are circulated and distributed by means of it. The operation,\r\n      in some measure, resembles that of the undertaker of some great work, who,\r\n      in consequence of some improvement in mechanics, takes down his old\r\n      machinery, and adds the difference between its price and that of the new\r\n      to his circulating capital, to the fund from which he furnishes materials\r\n      and wages to his workmen.\r\n\r\n      What is the proportion which the circulating money of any country bears to\r\n      the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it, it is\r\n      perhaps impossible to determine. It has been computed by different authors\r\n      at a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a thirtieth, part of that\r\n      value. But how small soever the proportion which the circulating money may\r\n      bear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and\r\n      frequently but a small part, of that produce, is ever destined for the\r\n      maintenance of industry, it must always bear a very considerable\r\n      proportion to that part. When, therefore, by the substitution of paper,\r\n      the gold and silver necessary for circulation is reduced to, perhaps, a\r\n      fifth part of the former quantity, if the value of only the greater part\r\n      of the other four-fifths be added to the funds which are destined for the\r\n      maintenance of industry, it must make a very considerable addition to the\r\n      quantity of that industry, and, consequently, to the value of the annual\r\n      produce of land and labour.\r\n\r\n      An operation of this kind has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty\r\n      years, been performed in Scotland, by the erection of new banking\r\n      companies in almost every considerable town, and even in some country\r\n      villages. The effects of it have been precisely those above described. The\r\n      business of the country is almost entirely carried on by means of the\r\n      paper of those different banking companies, with which purchases and\r\n      payments of all kinds are commonly made. Silver very seldom appears,\r\n      except in the change of a twenty shilling bank note, and gold still\r\n      seldomer. But though the conduct of all those different companies has not\r\n      been unexceptionable, and has accordingly required an act of parliament to\r\n      regulate it, the country, notwithstanding, has evidently derived great\r\n      benefit from their trade. I have heard it asserted, that the trade of the\r\n      city of Glasgow doubled in about fifteen years after the first erection of\r\n      the banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled\r\n      since the first erection of the two public banks at Edinburgh; of which\r\n      the one, called the Bank of Scotland, was established by act of parliament\r\n      in 1695, and the other, called the Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727.\r\n      Whether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or of the city of\r\n      Glasgow in particular, has really increased in so great a proportion,\r\n      during so short a period, I do not pretend to know. If either of them has\r\n      increased in this proportion, it seems to be an effect too great to be\r\n      accounted for by the sole operation of this cause. That the trade and\r\n      industry of Scotland, however, have increased very considerably during\r\n      this period, and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this\r\n      increase, cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\n      The value of the silver money which circulated in Scotland before the\r\n      Union in 1707, and which, immediately after it, was brought into the Bank\r\n      of Scotland, in order to be recoined, amounted to £411,117: 10: 9\r\n      sterling. No account has been got of the gold coin; but it appears from\r\n      the ancient accounts of the mint of Scotland, that the value of the gold\r\n      annually coined somewhat exceeded that of the silver. There were a good\r\n      many people, too, upon this occasion, who, from a diffidence of repayment,\r\n      did not bring their silver into the Bank of Scotland; and there was,\r\n      besides, some English coin, which was not called in. The whole value of\r\n      the gold and silver, therefore, which circulated in Scotland before the\r\n      Union, cannot be estimated at less than a million sterling. It seems to\r\n      have constituted almost the whole circulation of that country; for though\r\n      the circulation of the Bank of Scotland, which had then no rival, was\r\n      considerable, it seems to have made but a very small part of the whole. In\r\n      the present times, the whole circulation of Scotland cannot be estimated\r\n      at less than two millions, of which that part which consists in gold and\r\n      silver, most probably, does not amount to half a million. But though the\r\n      circulating gold and silver of Scotland have suffered so great a\r\n      diminution during this period, its real riches and prosperity do not\r\n      appear to have suffered any. Its agriculture, manufactures, and trade, on\r\n      the contrary, the annual produce of its land and labour, have evidently\r\n      been augmented.\r\n\r\n      It is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange, that is, by advancing\r\n      money upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and\r\n      bankers issue their promissory notes. They deduct always, upon whatever\r\n      sum they advance, the legal interest till the bill shall become due. The\r\n      payment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value\r\n      of what had been advanced, together with a clear profit of the interest.\r\n      The banker, who advances to the merchant whose bill he discounts, not gold\r\n      and silver, but his own promissory notes, has the advantage of being able\r\n      to discount to a greater amount by the whole value of his promissory\r\n      notes, which he finds, by experience, are commonly in circulation. He is\r\n      thereby enabled to make his clear gain of interest on so much a larger\r\n      sum.\r\n\r\n      The commerce of Scotland, which at present is not very great, was still\r\n      more inconsiderable when the two first banking companies were established;\r\n      and those companies would have had but little trade, had they confined\r\n      their business to the discounting of bills of exchange. They invented,\r\n      therefore, another method of issuing their promissory notes; by granting\r\n      what they call cash accounts, that is, by giving credit, to the extent of\r\n      a certain sum (two or three thousand pounds for example), to any\r\n      individual who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good\r\n      landed estate to become surety for him, that whatever money should be\r\n      advanced to him, within the sum for which the credit had been given,\r\n      should be repaid upon demand, together with the legal interest. Credits of\r\n      this kind are, I believe, commonly granted by banks and bankers in all\r\n      different parts of the world. But the easy terms upon which the Scotch\r\n      banking companies accept of repayment are, so far as I know, peculiar to\r\n      them, and have perhaps been the principal cause, both of the great trade\r\n      of those companies, and of the benefit which the country has received from\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      Whoever has a credit of this kind with one of those companies, and borrows\r\n      a thousand pounds upon it, for example, may repay this sum piece-meal, by\r\n      twenty and thirty pounds at a time, the company discounting a\r\n      proportionable part of the interest of the great sum, from the day on\r\n      which each of those small sums is paid in, till the whole be in this\r\n      manner repaid. All merchants, therefore, and almost all men of business,\r\n      find it convenient to keep such cash accounts with them, and are thereby\r\n      interested to promote the trade of those companies, by readily receiving\r\n      their notes in all payments, and by encouraging all those with whom they\r\n      have any influence to do the same. The banks, when their customers apply\r\n      to them for money, generally advance it to them in their own promissory\r\n      notes. These the merchants pay away to the manufacturers for goods, the\r\n      manufacturers to the farmers for materials and provisions, the farmers to\r\n      their landlords for rent; the landlords repay them to the merchants for\r\n      the conveniencies and luxuries with which they supply them, and the\r\n      merchants again return them to the banks, in order to balance their cash\r\n      accounts, or to replace what they may have borrowed of them; and thus\r\n      almost the whole money business of the country is transacted by means of\r\n      them. Hence the great trade of those companies.\r\n\r\n      By means of those cash accounts, every merchant can, without imprudence,\r\n      carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could do. If there are two\r\n      merchants, one in London and the other in Edinburgh, who employ equal\r\n      stocks in the same branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant can, without\r\n      imprudence, carry on a greater trade, and give employment to a greater\r\n      number of people, than the London merchant. The London merchant must\r\n      always keep by him a considerable sum of money, either in his own coffers,\r\n      or in those of his banker, who gives him no interest for it, in order to\r\n      answer the demands continually coming upon him for payment of the goods\r\n      which he purchases upon credit. Let the ordinary amount of this sum be\r\n      supposed five hundred pounds; the value of the goods in his warehouse must\r\n      always be less, by five hundred pounds, than it would have been, had he\r\n      not been obliged to keep such a sum unemployed. Let us suppose that he\r\n      generally disposes of his whole stock upon hand, or of goods to the value\r\n      of his whole stock upon hand, once in the year. By being obliged to keep\r\n      so great a sum unemployed, he must sell in a year five hundred pounds\r\n      worth less goods than he might otherwise have done. His annual profits\r\n      must be less by all that he could have made by the sale of five hundred\r\n      pounds worth more goods; and the number of people employed in preparing\r\n      his goods for the market must be less by all those that five hundred\r\n      pounds more stock could have employed. The merchant in Edinburgh, on the\r\n      other hand, keeps no money unemployed for answering such occasional\r\n      demands. When they actually come upon him, he satisfies them from his cash\r\n      account with the bank, and gradually replaces the sum borrowed with the\r\n      money or paper which comes in from the occasional sales of his goods. With\r\n      the same stock, therefore, he can, without imprudence, have at all times\r\n      in his warehouse a larger quantity of goods than the London merchant; and\r\n      can thereby both make a greater profit himself, and give constant\r\n      employment to a greater number of industrious people who prepare those\r\n      goods for the market. Hence the great benefit which the country has\r\n      derived from this trade.\r\n\r\n      The facility of discounting bills of exchange, it may be thought, indeed,\r\n      gives the English merchants a conveniency equivalent to the cash accounts\r\n      of the Scotch merchants. But the Scotch merchants, it must be remembered,\r\n      can discount their bills of exchange as easily as the English merchants;\r\n      and have, besides, the additional conveniency of their cash accounts.\r\n\r\n      The whole paper money of every kind which can easily circulate in any\r\n      country, never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which it\r\n      supplies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same) would\r\n      circulate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling notes,\r\n      for example, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the whole of\r\n      that currency which can easily circulate there, cannot exceed the sum of\r\n      gold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual\r\n      exchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards usually transacted within\r\n      that country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum, as\r\n      the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be employed in the circulation\r\n      of the country, it must immediately return upon the banks, to be exchanged\r\n      for gold and silver. Many people would immediately perceive that they had\r\n      more of this paper than was necessary for transacting their business at\r\n      home; and as they could not send it abroad, they would immediately demand\r\n      payment for it from the banks. When this superfluous paper was converted\r\n      into gold and silver, they could easily find a use for it, by sending it\r\n      abroad; but they could find none while it remained in the shape of paper.\r\n      There would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the banks to the whole\r\n      extent of this superfluous paper, and if they showed any difficulty or\r\n      backwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the alarm which this\r\n      would occasion necessarily increasing the run.\r\n\r\n      Over and above the expenses which are common to every branch of trade,\r\n      such as the expense of house-rent, the wages of servants, clerks,\r\n      accountants, etc. the expenses peculiar to a bank consist chiefly in two\r\n      articles: first, in the expense of keeping at all times in its coffers,\r\n      for answering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes, a large\r\n      sum of money, of which it loses the interest; and, secondly, in the\r\n      expense of replenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied by\r\n      answering such occasional demands.\r\n\r\n      A banking company which issues more paper than can be employed in the\r\n      circulation of the country, and of which the excess is continually\r\n      returning upon them for payment, ought to increase the quantity of gold\r\n      and silver which they keep at all times in their coffers, not only in\r\n      proportion to this excessive increase of their circulation, but in a much\r\n      greater proportion; their notes returning upon them much faster than in\r\n      proportion to the excess of their quantity. Such a company, therefore,\r\n      ought to increase the first article of their expense, not only in\r\n      proportion to this forced increase of their business, but in a much\r\n      greater proportion.\r\n\r\n      The coffers of such a company, too, though they ought to be filled much\r\n      fuller, yet must empty themselves much faster than if their business was\r\n      confined within more reasonable bounds, and must require not only a more\r\n      violent, but a more constant and uninterrupted exertion of expense, in\r\n      order to replenish them, The coin, too, which is thus continually drawn in\r\n      such large quantities from their coffers, cannot be employed in the\r\n      circulation of the country. It comes in place of a paper which is over and\r\n      above what can be employed in that circulation, and is, therefore, over\r\n      and above what can be employed in it too. But as that coin will not be\r\n      allowed to lie idle, it must, in one shape or another, be sent abroad, in\r\n      order to find that profitable employment which it cannot find at home; and\r\n      this continual exportation of gold and silver, by enhancing the\r\n      difficulty, must necessarily enhance still farther the expense of the\r\n      bank, in finding new gold and silver in order to replenish those coffers,\r\n      which empty themselves so very rapidly. Such a company, therefore, must in\r\n      proportion to this forced increase of their business, increase the second\r\n      article of their expense still more than the first.\r\n\r\n      Let us suppose that all the paper of a particular bank, which the\r\n      circulation of the country can easily absorb and employ, amounts exactly\r\n      to forty thousand pounds, and that, for answering occasional demands, this\r\n      bank is obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thousand pounds in\r\n      gold and silver. Should this bank attempt to circulate forty-four thousand\r\n      pounds, the four thousand pounds which are over and above what the\r\n      circulation can easily absorb and employ, will return upon it almost as\r\n      fast as they are issued. For answering occasional demands, therefore, this\r\n      bank ought to keep at all times in its coffers, not eleven thousand pounds\r\n      only, but fourteen thousand pounds. It will thus gain nothing by the\r\n      interest of the four thousand pounds excessive circulation; and it will\r\n      lose the whole expense of continually collecting four thousand pounds in\r\n      gold and silver, which will be continually going out of its coffers as\r\n      fast as they are brought into them.\r\n\r\n      Had every particular banking company always understood and attended to its\r\n      own particular interest, the circulation never could have been overstocked\r\n      with paper money. But every particular banking company has not always\r\n      understood or attended to its own particular interest, and the circulation\r\n      has frequently been overstocked with paper money.\r\n\r\n      By issuing too great a quantity of paper, of which the excess was\r\n      continually returning, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, the\r\n      Bank of England was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the\r\n      extent of between eight hundred thousand pounds and a million a-year; or,\r\n      at an average, about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds. For this\r\n      great coinage, the bank (in consequence of the worn and degraded state into\r\n      which the gold coin had fallen a few years ago) was frequently obliged to\r\n      purchase gold bullion at the high price of four pounds an ounce, which it\r\n      soon after issued in coin at £3:17:10 ½ an ounce, losing in this manner\r\n      between two and a half and three per cent. upon the coinage of so very\r\n      large a sum. Though the bank, therefore, paid no seignorage, though the\r\n      government was properly at the expense of this coinage, this liberality of\r\n      government did not prevent altogether the expense of the bank.\r\n\r\n      The Scotch banks, in consequence of an excess of the same kind, were all\r\n      obliged to employ constantly agents at London to collect money for them,\r\n      at an expense which was seldom below one and a half or two per cent. This\r\n      money was sent down by the waggon, and insured by the carriers at an\r\n      additional expense of three quarters per cent. or fifteen shillings on the\r\n      hundred pounds. Those agents were not always able to replenish the coffers\r\n      of their employers so fast as they were emptied. In this case, the\r\n      resource of the banks was, to draw upon their correspondents in London\r\n      bills of exchange, to the extent of the sum which they wanted. When those\r\n      correspondents afterwards drew upon them for the payment of this sum,\r\n      together with the interest and commission, some of those banks, from the\r\n      distress into which their excessive circulation had thrown them, had\r\n      sometimes no other means of satisfying this draught, but by drawing a\r\n      second set of bills, either upon the same, or upon some other\r\n      correspondents in London; and the same sum, or rather bills for the same\r\n      sum, would in this manner make sometimes more than two or three journeys;\r\n      the debtor bank paying always the interest and commission upon the whole\r\n      accumulated sum. Even those Scotch banks which never distinguished\r\n      themselves by their extreme imprudence, were sometimes obliged to employ\r\n      this ruinous resource.\r\n\r\n      The gold coin which was paid out, either by the Bank of England or by the\r\n      Scotch banks, in exchange for that part of their paper which was over and\r\n      above what could be employed in the circulation of the country, being\r\n      likewise over and above what could be employed in that circulation, was\r\n      sometimes sent abroad in the shape of coin, sometimes melted down and sent\r\n      abroad in the shape of bullion, and sometimes melted down and sold to the\r\n      Bank of England at the high price of four pounds an ounce. It was the\r\n      newest, the heaviest, and the best pieces only, which were carefully\r\n      picked out of the whole coin, and either sent abroad or melted down. At\r\n      home, and while they remained in the shape of coin, those heavy pieces\r\n      were of no more value than the light; but they were of more value abroad,\r\n      or when melted down into bullion at home. The Bank of England,\r\n      notwithstanding their great annual coinage, found, to their astonishment,\r\n      that there was every year the same scarcity of coin as there had been the\r\n      year before; and that, notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new\r\n      coin which was every year issued from the bank, the state of the coin,\r\n      instead of growing better and better, became every year worse and worse.\r\n      Every year they found themselves under the necessity of coining nearly the\r\n      same quantity of gold as they had coined the year before; and from the\r\n      continual rise in the price of gold bullion, in consequence of the\r\n      continual wearing and clipping of the coin, the expense of this great\r\n      annual coinage became, every year, greater and greater. The Bank of\r\n      England, it is to be observed, by supplying its own coffers with coin, is\r\n      indirectly obliged to supply the whole kingdom, into which coin is\r\n      continually flowing from those coffers in a great variety of ways.\r\n      Whatever coin, therefore, was wanted to support this excessive circulation\r\n      both of Scotch and English paper money, whatever vacuities this excessive\r\n      circulation occasioned in the necessary coin of the kingdom, the Bank of\r\n      England was obliged to supply them. The Scotch banks, no doubt, paid all\r\n      of them very dearly for their own imprudence and inattention: but the Bank\r\n      of England paid very dearly, not only for its own imprudence, but for the\r\n      much greater imprudence of almost all the Scotch banks.\r\n\r\n      The over-trading of some bold projectors in both parts of the united\r\n      kingdom, was the original cause of this excessive circulation of paper\r\n      money.\r\n\r\n      What a bank can with propriety advance to a merchant or undertaker of any\r\n      kind, is not either the whole capital with which he trades, or even any\r\n      considerable part of that capital; but that part of it only which he would\r\n      otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money, for\r\n      answering occasional demands. If the paper money which the bank advances\r\n      never exceeds this value, it can never exceed the value of the gold and\r\n      silver which would necessarily circulate in the country if there was no\r\n      paper money; it can never exceed the quantity which the circulation of the\r\n      country can easily absorb and employ.\r\n\r\n      When a bank discounts to a merchant a real bill of exchange, drawn by a\r\n      real creditor upon a real debtor, and which, as soon as it becomes due, is\r\n      really paid by that debtor; it only advances to him a part of the value\r\n      which he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready\r\n      money, for answering occasional demands. The payment of the bill, when it\r\n      becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what it had advanced,\r\n      together with the interest. The coffers of the bank, so far as its\r\n      dealings are confined to such customers, resemble a water-pond, from\r\n      which, though a stream is continually running out, yet another is\r\n      continually running in, fully equal to that which runs out; so that,\r\n      without any further care or attention, the pond keeps always equally, or\r\n      very near equally full. Little or no expense can ever be necessary for\r\n      replenishing the coffers of such a bank.\r\n\r\n      A merchant, without over-trading, may frequently have occasion for a sum\r\n      of ready money, even when he has no bills to discount. When a bank,\r\n      besides discounting his bills, advances him likewise, upon such occasions,\r\n      such sums upon his cash account, and accepts of a piece-meal repayment, as\r\n      the money comes in from the occasional sale of his goods, upon the easy\r\n      terms of the banking companies of Scotland; it dispenses him entirely from\r\n      the necessity of keeping any part of his stock by him unemployed and in\r\n      ready money for answering occasional demands. When such demands actually\r\n      come upon him, he can answer them sufficiently from his cash account. The\r\n      bank, however, in dealing with such customers, ought to observe with great\r\n      attention, whether, in the course of some short period (of four, five,\r\n      six, or eight months, for example), the sum of the repayments which it\r\n      commonly receives from them, is, or is not, fully equal to that of the\r\n      advances which it commonly makes to them. If, within the course of such\r\n      short periods, the sum of the repayments from certain customers is, upon\r\n      most occasions, fully equal to that of the advances, it may safely\r\n      continue to deal with such customers. Though the stream which is in this\r\n      case continually running out from its coffers may be very large, that\r\n      which is continually running into them must be at least equally large, so\r\n      that, without any further care or attention, those coffers are likely to\r\n      be always equally or very near equally full, and scarce ever to require\r\n      any extraordinary expense to replenish them. If, on the contrary, the sum\r\n      of the repayments from certain other customers, falls commonly very much\r\n      short of the advances which it makes to them, it cannot with any safety\r\n      continue to deal with such customers, at least if they continue to deal\r\n      with it in this manner. The stream which is in this case continually\r\n      running out from its coffers, is necessarily much larger than that which\r\n      is continually running in; so that, unless they are replenished by some\r\n      great and continual effort of expense, those coffers must soon be\r\n      exhausted altogether.\r\n\r\n      The banking companies of Scotland, accordingly, were for a long time very\r\n      careful to require frequent and regular repayments from all their\r\n      customers, and did not care to deal with any person, whatever might be his\r\n      fortune or credit, who did not make, what they called, frequent and\r\n      regular operations with them. By this attention, besides saving almost\r\n      entirely the extraordinary expense of replenishing their coffers, they\r\n      gained two other very considerable advantages.\r\n\r\n      First, by this attention they were enabled to make some tolerable judgment\r\n      concerning the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors,\r\n      without being obliged to look out for any other evidence besides what\r\n      their own books afforded them; men being, for the most part, either\r\n      regular or irregular in their repayments, according as their circumstances\r\n      are either thriving or declining. A private man who lends out his money to\r\n      perhaps half a dozen or a dozen of debtors, may, either by himself or his\r\n      agents, observe and inquire both constantly and carefully into the conduct\r\n      and situation of each of them. But a banking company, which lends money to\r\n      perhaps five hundred different people, and of which the attention is\r\n      continually occupied by objects of a very different kind, can have no\r\n      regular information concerning the conduct and circumstances of the\r\n      greater part of its debtors, beyond what its own books afford it. In\r\n      requiring frequent and regular repayments from all their customers, the\r\n      banking companies of Scotland had probably this advantage in view.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, by this attention they secured themselves from the possibility\r\n      of issuing more paper money than what the circulation of the country could\r\n      easily absorb and employ. When they observed, that within moderate periods\r\n      of time, the repayments of a particular customer were, upon most\r\n      occasions, fully equal to the advances which they had made to him, they\r\n      might be assured that the paper money which they had advanced to him had\r\n      not, at any time, exceeded the quantity of gold and silver which he would\r\n      otherwise have been obliged to keep by him for answering occasional\r\n      demands; and that, consequently, the paper money, which they had\r\n      circulated by his means, had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold\r\n      and silver which would have circulated in the country, had there been no\r\n      paper money. The frequency, regularity, and amount of his repayments,\r\n      would sufficiently demonstrate that the amount of their advances had at no\r\n      time exceeded that part of his capital which he would otherwise have been\r\n      obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money, for answering\r\n      occasional demands; that is, for the purpose of keeping the rest of his\r\n      capital in constant employment. It is this part of his capital only which,\r\n      within moderate periods of time, is continually returning to every dealer\r\n      in the shape of money, whether paper or coin, and continually going from\r\n      him in the same shape. If the advances of the bank had commonly exceeded\r\n      this part of his capital, the ordinary amount of his repayments could not,\r\n      within moderate periods of time, have equalled the ordinary amount of its\r\n      advances. The stream which, by means of his dealings, was continually\r\n      running into the coffers of the bank, could not have been equal to the\r\n      stream which, by means of the same dealings was continually running out.\r\n      The advances of the bank paper, by exceeding the quantity of gold and\r\n      silver which, had there been no such advances, he would have been obliged\r\n      to keep by him for answering occasional demands, might soon come to exceed\r\n      the whole quantity of gold and silver which ( the commerce being supposed\r\n      the same ) would have circulated in the country, had there been no paper\r\n      money; and, consequently, to exceed the quantity which the circulation of\r\n      the country could easily absorb and employ; and the excess of this paper\r\n      money would immediately have returned upon the bank, in order to be\r\n      exchanged for gold and silver. This second advantage, though equally real,\r\n      was not, perhaps, so well understood by all the different banking\r\n      companies in Scotland as the first.\r\n\r\n      When, partly by the conveniency of discounting bills, and partly by that\r\n      of cash accounts, the creditable traders of any country can be dispensed\r\n      from the necessity of keeping any part of their stock by them unemployed,\r\n      and in ready money, for answering occasional demands, they can reasonably\r\n      expect no farther assistance from hanks and bankers, who, when they have\r\n      gone thus far, cannot, consistently with their own interest and safety, go\r\n      farther. A bank cannot, consistently with its own interest, advance to a\r\n      trader the whole, or even the greater part of the circulating capital with\r\n      which he trades; because, though that capital is continually returning to\r\n      him in the shape of money, and going from him in the same shape, yet the\r\n      whole of the returns is too distant from the whole of the outgoings, and\r\n      the sum of his repayments could not equal the sum of his advances within\r\n      such moderate periods of time as suit the conveniency of a bank. Still\r\n      less could a bank afford to advance him any considerable part of his fixed\r\n      capital; of the capital which the undertaker of an iron forge, for\r\n      example, employs in erecting his forge and smelting-houses, his\r\n      work-houses, and warehouses, the dwelling-houses of his workmen, etc.; of\r\n      the capital which the undertaker of a mine employs in sinking his shafts,\r\n      in erecting engines for drawing out the water, in making roads and\r\n      waggon-ways, etc.; of the capital which the person who undertakes to\r\n      improve land employs in clearing, draining, inclosing, manuring, and\r\n      ploughing waste and uncultivated fields; in building farmhouses, with all\r\n      their necessary appendages of stables, granaries, etc. The returns of the\r\n      fixed capital are, in almost all cases, much slower than those of the\r\n      circulating capital: and such expenses, even when laid out with the\r\n      greatest prudence and judgment, very seldom return to the undertaker till\r\n      after a period of many years, a period by far too distant to suit the\r\n      conveniency of a bank. Traders and other undertakers may, no doubt with\r\n      great propriety, carry on a very considerable part of their projects with\r\n      borrowed money. In justice to their creditors, however, their own capital\r\n      ought in this case to be sufficient to insure, if I may say so, the\r\n      capital of those creditors; or to render it extremely improbable that\r\n      those creditors should incur any loss, even though the success of the\r\n      project should fall very much short of the expectation of the projectors.\r\n      Even with this precaution, too, the money which is borrowed, and which it\r\n      is meant should not be repaid till after a period of several years, ought\r\n      not to be borrowed of a bank, but ought to be borrowed upon bond or\r\n      mortgage, of such private people as propose to live upon the interest of\r\n      their money, without taking the trouble themselves to employ the capital,\r\n      and who are, upon that account, willing to lend that capital to such\r\n      people of good credit as are likely to keep it for several years. A bank,\r\n      indeed, which lends its money without the expense of stamped paper, or of\r\n      attorneys’ fees for drawing bonds and mortgages, and which accepts of\r\n      repayment upon the easy terms of the banking companies of Scotland, would,\r\n      no doubt, be a very convenient creditor to such traders and undertakers.\r\n      But such traders and undertakers would surely be most inconvenient debtors\r\n      to such a bank.\r\n\r\n      It is now more than five and twenty years since the paper money issued by\r\n      the different banking companies of Scotland was fully equal, or rather was\r\n      somewhat more than fully equal, to what the circulation of the country\r\n      could easily absorb and employ. Those companies, therefore, had so long\r\n      ago given all the assistance to the traders and other undertakers of\r\n      Scotland which it is possible for banks and bankers, consistently with\r\n      their own interest, to give. They had even done somewhat more. They had\r\n      over-traded a little, and had brought upon themselves that loss, or at\r\n      least that diminution of profit, which, in this particular business, never\r\n      fails to attend the smallest degree of over-trading. Those traders and\r\n      other undertakers, having got so much assistance from banks and bankers,\r\n      wished to get still more. The banks, they seem to have thought, could\r\n      extend their credits to whatever sum might be wanted, without incurring\r\n      any other expense besides that of a few reams of paper. They complained of\r\n      the contracted views and dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks,\r\n      which did not, they said, extend their credits in proportion to the\r\n      extension of the trade of the country; meaning, no doubt, by the extension\r\n      of that trade, the extension of their own projects beyond what they could\r\n      carry on either with their own capital, or with what they had credit to\r\n      borrow of private people in the usual way of bond or mortgage. The banks,\r\n      they seem to have thought, were in honour bound to supply the deficiency,\r\n      and to provide them with all the capital which they wanted to trade with.\r\n      The banks, however, were of a different opinion; and upon their refusing\r\n      to extend their credits, some of those traders had recourse to an\r\n      expedient which, for a time, served their purpose, though at a much\r\n      greater expense, yet as effectually as the utmost extension of bank\r\n      credits could have done. This expedient was no other than the well known\r\n      shift of drawing and redrawing; the shift to which unfortunate traders\r\n      have sometimes recourse, when they are upon the brink of bankruptcy. The\r\n      practice of raising money in this manner had been long known in England;\r\n      and, during the course of the late war, when the high profits of trade\r\n      afforded a great temptation to over-trading, is said to have been carried\r\n      on to a very great extent. From England it was brought into Scotland,\r\n      where, in proportion to the very limited commerce, and to the very\r\n      moderate capital of the country, it was soon carried on to a much greater\r\n      extent than it ever had been in England.\r\n\r\n      The practice of drawing and redrawing is so well known to all men of\r\n      business, that it may, perhaps, be thought unnecessary to give any account\r\n      of it. But as this book may come into the hands of many people who are not\r\n      men of business, and as the effects of this practice upon the banking\r\n      trade are not, perhaps, generally understood, even by men of business\r\n      themselves, I shall endeavour to explain it as distinctly as I can.\r\n\r\n      The customs of merchants, which were established when the barbarous laws\r\n      of Europe did not enforce the performance of their contracts, and which,\r\n      during the course of the two last centuries, have been adopted into the\r\n      laws of all European nations, have given such extraordinary privileges to\r\n      bills of exchange, that money is more readily advanced upon them than upon\r\n      any other species of obligation; especially when they are made payable\r\n      within so short a period as two or three months after their date. If, when\r\n      the bill becomes due, the acceptor does not pay it as soon as it is\r\n      presented, he becomes from that moment a bankrupt. The bill is protested,\r\n      and returns upon the drawer, who, if he does not immediately pay it,\r\n      becomes likewise a bankrupt. If, before it came to the person who presents\r\n      it to the acceptor for payment, it had passed through the hands of several\r\n      other persons, who had successively advanced to one another the contents\r\n      of it, either in money or goods, and who, to express that each of them had\r\n      in his turn received those contents, had all of them in their order\r\n      indorsed, that is, written their names upon the back of the bill; each\r\n      indorser becomes in his turn liable to the owner of the bill for those\r\n      contents, and, if he fails to pay, he becomes too, from that moment, a\r\n      bankrupt. Though the drawer, acceptor, and indorsers of the bill, should\r\n      all of them be persons of doubtful credit; yet, still the shortness of the\r\n      date gives some security to the owner of the bill. Though all of them may\r\n      be very likely to become bankrupts, it is a chance if they all become so\r\n      in so short a time. The house is crazy, says a weary traveller to himself,\r\n      and will not stand very long; but it is a chance if it falls to-night, and\r\n      I will venture, therefore, to sleep in it to-night.\r\n\r\n      The trader A in Edinburgh, we shall suppose, draws a bill upon B in\r\n      London, payable two months after date. In reality B in London owes nothing\r\n      to A in Edinburgh; but he agrees to accept of A’s bill, upon condition,\r\n      that before the term of payment he shall redraw upon A in Edinburgh for\r\n      the same sum, together with the interest and a commission, another bill,\r\n      payable likewise two months after date. B accordingly, before the\r\n      expiration of the first two months, redraws this bill upon A in Edinburgh;\r\n      who, again before the expiration of the second two months, draws a second\r\n      bill upon B in London, payable likewise two months after date; and before\r\n      the expiration of the third two months, B in London redraws upon A in\r\n      Edinburgh another bill payable also two months after date. This practice\r\n      has sometimes gone on, not only for several months, but for several years\r\n      together, the bill always returning upon A in Edinburgh with the\r\n      accumulated interest and commission of all the former bills. The interest\r\n      was five per cent. in the year, and the commission was never less than one\r\n      half per cent. on each draught. This commission being repeated more than\r\n      six times in the year, whatever money A might raise by this expedient\r\n      might necessarily have cost him something more than eight per cent. in the\r\n      year and sometimes a great deal more, when either the price of the\r\n      commission happened to rise, or when he was obliged to pay compound\r\n      interest upon the interest and commission of former bills. This practice\r\n      was called raising money by circulation.\r\n\r\n      In a country where the ordinary profits of stock, in the greater part of\r\n      mercantile projects, are supposed to run between six and ten per cent. it\r\n      must have been a very fortunate speculation, of which the returns could\r\n      not only repay the enormous expense at which the money was thus borrowed\r\n      for carrying it on, but afford, besides, a good surplus profit to the\r\n      projector. Many vast and extensive projects, however, were undertaken, and\r\n      for several years carried on, without any other fund to support them\r\n      besides what was raised at this enormous expense. The projectors, no\r\n      doubt, had in their golden dreams the most distinct vision of this great\r\n      profit. Upon their awakening, however, either at the end of their\r\n      projects, or when they were no longer able to carry them on, they very\r\n      seldom, I believe, had the good fortune to find it.\r\n\r\n      {The method described in the text was by no means either the most common\r\n      or the most expensive one in which those adventurers sometimes raised\r\n      money by circulation. It frequently happened, that A in Edinburgh would\r\n      enable B in London to pay the first bill of exchange, by drawing, a few\r\n      days before it became due, a second bill at three months date upon the\r\n      same B in London. This bill, being payable to his own order, A sold in\r\n      Edinburgh at par; and with its contents purchased bills upon London,\r\n      payable at sight to the order of B, to whom he sent them by the post.\r\n      Towards the end of the late war, the exchange between Edinburgh and London\r\n      was frequently three per cent. against Edinburgh, and those bills at sight\r\n      must frequently have cost A that premium. This transaction, therefore,\r\n      being repeated at least four times in the year, and being loaded with a\r\n      commission of at least one half per cent. upon each repetition, must at\r\n      that period have cost A, at least, fourteen per cent. in the year. At\r\n      other times A would enable to discharge the first bill of exchange, by\r\n      drawing, a few days before it became due, a second bill at two months\r\n      date, not upon B, but upon some third person, C, for example, in London.\r\n      This other bill was made payable to the order of B, who, upon its being\r\n      accepted by C, discounted it with some banker in London; and A enabled C\r\n      to discharge it, by drawing, a few day’s before it became due, a third\r\n      bill likewise at two months date, sometimes upon his first correspondent\r\n      B, and sometimes upon some fourth or fifth person, D or E, for example.\r\n      This third bill was made payable to the order of C, who, as soon as it was\r\n      accepted, discounted it in the same manner with some banker in London.\r\n      Such operations being repeated at least six times in the year, and being\r\n      loaded with a commission of at least one half per cent. upon each\r\n      repetition, together with the legal interest of five per cent. this method\r\n      of raising money, in the same manner as that described in the text, must\r\n      have cost A something more than eight per cent. By saving, however, the\r\n      exchange between Edinburgh and London, it was less expensive than that\r\n      mentioned in the foregoing part of this note; but then it required an\r\n      established credit with more houses than one in London, an advantage which\r\n      many of these adventurers could not always find it easy to procure.}\r\n\r\n      The bills which A in Edinburgh drew upon B in London, he regularly\r\n      discounted two months before they were due, with some bank or banker in\r\n      Edinburgh; and the bills which B in London redrew upon A in Edinburgh, he\r\n      as regularly discounted, either with the Bank of England, or with some\r\n      other banker in London. Whatever was advanced upon such circulating bills\r\n      was in Edinburgh advanced in the paper of the Scotch banks; and in London,\r\n      when they were discounted at the Bank of England in the paper of that\r\n      bank. Though the bills upon which this paper had been advanced were all of\r\n      them repaid in their turn as soon as they became due, yet the value which\r\n      had been really advanced upon the first bill was never really returned to\r\n      the banks which advanced it; because, before each bill became due, another\r\n      bill was always drawn to somewhat a greater amount than the bill which was\r\n      soon to be paid: and the discounting of this other bill was essentially\r\n      necessary towards the payment of that which was soon to be due. This\r\n      payment, therefore, was altogether fictitious. The stream which, by means\r\n      of those circulating bills of exchange, had once been made to run out from\r\n      the coffers of the banks, was never replaced by any stream which really\r\n      ran into them.\r\n\r\n      The paper which was issued upon those circulating bills of exchange\r\n      amounted, upon many occasions, to the whole fund destined for carrying on\r\n      some vast and extensive project of agriculture, commerce, or manufactures;\r\n      and not merely to that part of it which, had there been no paper money,\r\n      the projector would have been obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in\r\n      ready money, for answering occasional demands. The greater part of this\r\n      paper was, consequently, over and above the value of the gold and silver\r\n      which would have circulated in the country, had there been no paper money.\r\n      It was over and above, therefore, what the circulation of the country\r\n      could easily absorb and employ, and upon that account, immediately\r\n      returned upon the banks, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver,\r\n      which they were to find as they could. It was a capital which those\r\n      projectors had very artfully contrived to draw from those banks, not only\r\n      without their knowledge or deliberate consent, but for some time, perhaps,\r\n      without their having the most distant suspicion that they had really\r\n      advanced it.\r\n\r\n      When two people, who are continually drawing and redrawing upon one\r\n      another, discount their bills always with the same banker, he must\r\n      immediately discover what they are about, and see clearly that they are\r\n      trading, not with any capital of their own, but with the capital which he\r\n      advances to them. But this discovery is not altogether so easy when they\r\n      discount their bills sometimes with one banker, and sometimes with\r\n      another, and when the two same persons do not constantly draw and redraw\r\n      upon one another, but occasionally run the round of a great circle of\r\n      projectors, who find it for their interest to assist one another in this\r\n      method of raising money and to render it, upon that account, as difficult\r\n      as possible to distinguish between a real and a fictitious bill of\r\n      exchange, between a bill drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor, and\r\n      a bill for which there was properly no real creditor but the bank which\r\n      discounted it, nor any real debtor but the projector who made use of the\r\n      money. When a banker had even made this discovery, he might sometimes make\r\n      it too late, and might find that he had already discounted the bills of\r\n      those projectors to so great an extent, that, by refusing to discount any\r\n      more, he would necessarily make them all bankrupts; and thus by ruining\r\n      them, might perhaps ruin himself. For his own interest and safety,\r\n      therefore, he might find it necessary, in this very perilous situation, to\r\n      go on for some time, endeavouring, however, to withdraw gradually, and,\r\n      upon that account, making every day greater and greater difficulties about\r\n      discounting, in order to force these projectors by degrees to have\r\n      recourse, either to other bankers, or to other methods of raising money:\r\n      so as that he himself might, as soon as possible, get out of the circle.\r\n      The difficulties, accordingly, which the Bank of England, which the\r\n      principal bankers in London, and which even the more prudent Scotch banks\r\n      began, after a certain time, and when all of them had already gone too\r\n      far, to make about discounting, not only alarmed, but enraged, in the\r\n      highest degree, those projectors. Their own distress, of which this\r\n      prudent and necessary reserve of the banks was, no doubt, the immediate\r\n      occasion, they called the distress of the country; and this distress of\r\n      the country, they said, was altogether owing to the ignorance,\r\n      pusillanimity, and bad conduct of the banks, which did not give a\r\n      sufficiently liberal aid to the spirited undertakings of those who exerted\r\n      themselves in order to beautify, improve, and enrich the country. It was\r\n      the duty of the banks, they seemed to think, to lend for as long a time,\r\n      and to as great an extent, as they might wish to borrow. The banks,\r\n      however, by refusing in this manner to give more credit to those to whom\r\n      they had already given a great deal too much, took the only method by\r\n      which it was now possible to save either their own credit, or the public\r\n      credit of the country.\r\n\r\n      In the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank was established in\r\n      Scotland, for the express purpose of relieving the distress of the\r\n      country. The design was generous; but the execution was imprudent, and the\r\n      nature and causes of the distress which it meant to relieve, were not,\r\n      perhaps, well understood. This bank was more liberal than any other had\r\n      ever been, both in granting cash-accounts, and in discounting bills of\r\n      exchange. With regard to the latter, it seems to have made scarce any\r\n      distinction between real and circulating bills, but to have discounted all\r\n      equally. It was the avowed principle of this bank to advance upon any\r\n      reasonable security, the whole capital which was to be employed in those\r\n      improvements of which the returns are the most slow and distant, such as\r\n      the improvements of land. To promote such improvements was even said to be\r\n      the chief of the public-spirited purposes for which it was instituted. By\r\n      its liberality in granting cash-accounts, and in discounting bills of\r\n      exchange, it, no doubt, issued great quantities of its bank notes. But\r\n      those bank notes being, the greater part of them, over and above what the\r\n      circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ, returned upon\r\n      it, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, as fast as they were\r\n      issued. Its coffers were never well filled. The capital which had been\r\n      subscribed to this bank, at two different subscriptions, amounted to one\r\n      hundred and sixty thousand pounds, of which eighty per cent. only was paid\r\n      up. This sum ought to have been paid in at several different instalments.\r\n      A great part of the proprietors, when they paid in their first instalment,\r\n      opened a cash-account with the bank; and the directors, thinking\r\n      themselves obliged to treat their own proprietors with the same liberality\r\n      with which they treated all other men, allowed many of them to borrow upon\r\n      this cash-account what they paid in upon all their subsequent instalments.\r\n      Such payments, therefore, only put into one coffer what had the moment\r\n      before been taken out of another. But had the coffers of this bank been\r\n      filled ever so well, its excessive circulation must have emptied them\r\n      faster than they could have been replenished by any other expedient but\r\n      the ruinous one of drawing upon London; and when the bill became due,\r\n      paying it, together with interest and commission, by another draught upon\r\n      the same place. Its coffers having been filled so very ill, it is said to\r\n      have been driven to this resource within a very few months after it began\r\n      to do business. The estates of the proprietors of this bank were worth\r\n      several millions, and, by their subscription to the original bond or\r\n      contract of the bank, were really pledged for answering all its\r\n      engagements. By means of the great credit which so great a pledge\r\n      necessarily gave it, it was, notwithstanding its too liberal conduct,\r\n      enabled to carry on business for more than two years. When it was obliged\r\n      to stop, it had in the circulation about two hundred thousand pounds in\r\n      bank notes. In order to support the circulation of those notes, which were\r\n      continually returning upon it as fast as they were issued, it had been\r\n      constantly in the practice of drawing bills of exchange upon London, of\r\n      which the number and value were continually increasing, and, when it\r\n      stopt, amounted to upwards of six hundred thousand pounds. This bank,\r\n      therefore, had, in little more than the course of two years, advanced to\r\n      different people upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds at five per\r\n      cent. Upon the two hundred thousand pounds which it circulated in bank\r\n      notes, this five per cent. might perhaps be considered as a clear gain,\r\n      without any other deduction besides the expense of management. But upon\r\n      upwards of six hundred thousand pounds, for which it was continually\r\n      drawing bills of exchange upon London, it was paying, in the way of\r\n      interest and commission, upwards of eight per cent. and was consequently\r\n      losing more than three per cent. upon more than three fourths of all its\r\n      dealings.\r\n\r\n      The operations of this bank seem to have produced effects quite opposite\r\n      to those which were intended by the particular persons who planned and\r\n      directed it. They seem to have intended to support the spirited\r\n      undertakings, for as such they considered them, which were at that time\r\n      carrying on in different parts of the country; and, at the same time, by\r\n      drawing the whole banking business to themselves, to supplant all the\r\n      other Scotch banks, particularly those established at Edinburgh, whose\r\n      backwardness in discounting bills of exchange had given some offence. This\r\n      bank, no doubt, gave some temporary relief to those projectors, and\r\n      enabled them to carry on their projects for about two years longer than\r\n      they could otherwise have done. But it thereby only enabled them to get so\r\n      much deeper into debt; so that, when ruin came, it fell so much the\r\n      heavier both upon them and upon their creditors. The operations of this\r\n      bank, therefore, instead of relieving, in reality aggravated in the\r\n      long-run the distress which those projectors had brought both upon\r\n      themselves and upon their country. It would have been much better for\r\n      themselves, their creditors, and their country, had the greater part of\r\n      them been obliged to stop two years sooner than they actually did. The\r\n      temporary relief, however, which this bank afforded to those projectors,\r\n      proved a real and permanent relief to the other Scotch banks. All the\r\n      dealers in circulating bills of exchange, which those other banks had\r\n      become so backward in discounting, had recourse to this new bank, where\r\n      they were received with open arms. Those other banks, therefore, were\r\n      enabled to get very easily out of that fatal circle, from which they could\r\n      not otherwise have disengaged themselves without incurring a considerable\r\n      loss, and perhaps, too, even some degree of discredit.\r\n\r\n      In the long-run, therefore, the operations of this bank increased the real\r\n      distress of the country, which it meant to relieve; and effectually\r\n      relieved, from a very great distress, those rivals whom it meant to\r\n      supplant.\r\n\r\n      At the first setting out of this bank, it was the opinion of some people,\r\n      that how fast soever its coffers might be emptied, it might easily\r\n      replenish them, by raising money upon the securities of those to whom it\r\n      had advanced its paper. Experience, I believe, soon convinced them that\r\n      this method of raising money was by much too slow to answer their purpose;\r\n      and that coffers which originally were so ill filled, and which emptied\r\n      themselves so very fast, could be replenished by no other expedient but\r\n      the ruinous one of drawing bills upon London, and when they became due,\r\n      paying them by other draughts on the same place, with accumulated interest\r\n      and commission. But though they had been able by this method to raise\r\n      money as fast as they wanted it, yet, instead of making a profit, they\r\n      must have suffered a loss of every such operation; so that in the long-run\r\n      they must have ruined themselves as a mercantile company, though perhaps\r\n      not so soon as by the more expensive practice of drawing and redrawing.\r\n      They could still have made nothing by the interest of the paper, which,\r\n      being over and above what the circulation of the country could absorb and\r\n      employ, returned upon them in order to be exchanged for gold and silver,\r\n      as fast as they issued it; and for the payment of which they were\r\n      themselves continually obliged to borrow money. On the contrary, the whole\r\n      expense of this borrowing, of employing agents to look out for people who\r\n      had money to lend, of negotiating with those people, and of drawing the\r\n      proper bond or assignment, must have fallen upon them, and have been so\r\n      much clear loss upon the balance of their accounts. The project of\r\n      replenishing their coffers in this manner may be compared to that of a man\r\n      who had a water-pond from which a stream was continually running out, and\r\n      into which no stream was continually running, but who proposed to keep it\r\n      always equally full, by employing a number of people to go continually\r\n      with buckets to a well at some miles distance, in order to bring water to\r\n      replenish it.\r\n\r\n      But though this operation had proved not only practicable, but profitable\r\n      to the bank, as a mercantile company; yet the country could have derived\r\n      no benefit front it, but, on the contrary, must have suffered a very\r\n      considerable loss by it. This operation could not augment, in the smallest\r\n      degree, the quantity of money to be lent. It could only have erected this\r\n      bank into a sort of general loan office for the whole country. Those who\r\n      wanted to borrow must have applied to this bank, instead of applying to\r\n      the private persons who had lent it their money. But a bank which lends\r\n      money, perhaps to five hundred different people, the greater part of whom\r\n      its directors can know very little about, is not likely to be more\r\n      judicious in the choice of its debtors than a private person who lends out\r\n      his money among a few people whom he knows, and in whose sober and frugal\r\n      conduct he thinks he has good reason to confide. The debtors of such a\r\n      bank as that whose conduct I have been giving some account of were likely,\r\n      the greater part of them, to be chimerical projectors, the drawers and\r\n      redrawers of circulating bills of exchange, who would employ the money in\r\n      extravagant undertakings, which, with all the assistance that could be\r\n      given them, they would probably never be able to complete, and which, if\r\n      they should be completed, would never repay the expense which they had\r\n      really cost, would never afford a fund capable of maintaining a quantity\r\n      of labour equal to that which had been employed about them. The sober and\r\n      frugal debtors of private persons, on the contrary, would be more likely\r\n      to employ the money borrowed in sober undertakings which were proportioned\r\n      to their capitals, and which, though they might have less of the grand and\r\n      the marvellous, would have more of the solid and the profitable; which\r\n      would repay with a large profit whatever had been laid out upon them, and\r\n      which would thus afford a fund capable of maintaining a much greater\r\n      quantity of labour than that which had been employed about them. The\r\n      success of this operation, therefore, without increasing in the smallest\r\n      degree the capital of the country, would only have transferred a great\r\n      part of it from prudent and profitable to imprudent and unprofitable\r\n      undertakings.\r\n\r\n      That the industry of Scotland languished for want of money to employ it,\r\n      was the opinion of the famous Mr Law. By establishing a bank of a\r\n      particular kind, which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to the\r\n      amount of the whole value of all the lands in the country, he proposed to\r\n      remedy this want of money. The parliament of Scotland, when he first\r\n      proposed his project, did not think proper to adopt it. It was afterwards\r\n      adopted, with some variations, by the Duke of Orleans, at that time regent\r\n      of France. The idea of the possibility of multiplying paper money to\r\n      almost any extent was the real foundation of what is called the\r\n      Mississippi scheme, the most extravagant project, both of banking and\r\n      stock-jobbing, that perhaps the world ever saw. The different operations\r\n      of this scheme are explained so fully, so clearly, and with so much order\r\n      and distinctness, by Mr Du Verney, in his Examination of the Political\r\n      Reflections upon commerce and finances of Mr Du Tot, that I shall not give\r\n      any account of them. The principles upon which it was founded are\r\n      explained by Mr Law himself, in a discourse concerning money and trade,\r\n      which he published in Scotland when he first proposed his project. The\r\n      splendid but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some other\r\n      works upon the same principles, still continue to make an impression upon\r\n      many people, and have, perhaps, in part, contributed to that excess of\r\n      banking, which has of late been complained of, both in Scotland and in\r\n      other places.\r\n\r\n      The Bank of England is the greatest bank of circulation in Europe. It was\r\n      incorporated, in pursuance of an act of parliament, by a charter under the\r\n      great seal, dated the 27th of July 1694. It at that time advanced to\r\n      government the sum of £1,200,000 for an annuity of £100,000, or for £\r\n      96,000 a-year, interest at the rate of eight per cent. and £4,000 a-year for\r\n      the expense of management. The credit of the new government, established\r\n      by the Revolution, we may believe, must have been very low, when it was\r\n      obliged to borrow at so high an interest.\r\n\r\n      In 1697, the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock, by an\r\n      ingraftment of £1,001,171:10s. Its whole capital stock, therefore,\r\n      amounted at this time to £2,201,171: 10s. This ingraftment is said to have\r\n      been for the support of public credit. In 1696, tallies had been at forty,\r\n      and fifty, and sixty, per cent. discount, and bank notes at twenty per\r\n      cent. {James Postlethwaite’s History of the Public Revenue, p.301.} During\r\n      the great re-coinage of the silver, which was going on at this time, the\r\n      bank had thought proper to discontinue the payment of its notes, which\r\n      necessarily occasioned their discredit.\r\n\r\n      In pursuance of the 7th Anne, c. 7, the bank advanced and paid into the\r\n      exchequer the sum of £400,000; making in all the sum of £1,600,000, which\r\n      it had advanced upon its original annuity of £96,000 interest, and £4,000\r\n      for expense of management. In 1708, therefore, the credit of government\r\n      was as good as that of private persons, since it could borrow at six per\r\n      cent. interest, the common legal and market rate of those times. In\r\n      pursuance of the same act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the\r\n      amount of £ 1,775,027: 17s: 10½d. at six per cent. interest, and was at\r\n      the same time allowed to take in subscriptions for doubling its capital.\r\n      In 1703, therefore, the capital of the bank amounted to £4,402,343; and it\r\n      had advanced to government the sum of £3,375,027:17:10½d.\r\n\r\n      By a call of fifteen per cent. in 1709, there was paid in, and made stock,\r\n      £ 656,204:1:9d.; and by another of ten per cent. in 1710, £501,448:12:11d.\r\n      In consequence of those two calls, therefore, the bank capital amounted to\r\n      £ 5,559,995:14:8d.\r\n\r\n      In pursuance of the 3rd George I. c.8, the bank delivered up two millions\r\n      of exchequer Bills to be cancelled. It had at this time, therefore,\r\n      advanced to government £5,375,027:17 10d. In pursuance of the 8th George\r\n      I. c.21, the bank purchased of the South-sea company, stock to the amount\r\n      of £4,000,000: and in 1722, in consequence of the subscriptions which it\r\n      had taken in for enabling it to make this purchase, its capital stock was\r\n      increased by £ 3,400,000. At this time, therefore, the bank had advanced\r\n      to the public £ 9,375,027 17s. 10½d.; and its capital stock amounted only\r\n      to £ 8,959,995:14:8d. It was upon this occasion that the sum which the\r\n      bank had advanced to the public, and for which it received interest, began\r\n      first to exceed its capital stock, or the sum for which it paid a dividend\r\n      to the proprietors of bank stock; or, in other words, that the bank began\r\n      to have an undivided capital, over and above its divided one. It has\r\n      continued to have an undivided capital of the same kind ever since. In\r\n      1746, the bank had, upon different occasions, advanced to the public\r\n      £11,686,800, and its divided capital had been raised by different calls\r\n      and subscriptions to £ 10,780,000. The state of those two sums has\r\n      continued to be the same ever since. In pursuance of the 4th of George\r\n      III. c.25, the bank agreed to pay to government for the renewal of its\r\n      charter £110,000, without interest or re-payment. This sum, therefore did\r\n      not increase either of those two other sums.\r\n\r\n      The dividend of the bank has varied according to the variations in the\r\n      rate of the interest which it has, at different times, received for the\r\n      money it had advanced to the public, as well as according to other\r\n      circumstances. This rate of interest has gradually been reduced from eight\r\n      to three per cent. For some years past, the bank dividend has been at five\r\n      and a half per cent.\r\n\r\n      The stability of the bank of England is equal to that of the British\r\n      government. All that it has advanced to the public must be lost before its\r\n      creditors can sustain any loss. No other banking company in England can be\r\n      established by act of parliament, or can consist of more than six members.\r\n      It acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of state. It\r\n      receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the\r\n      creditors of the public; it circulates exchequer bills; and it advances to\r\n      government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes, which are\r\n      frequently not paid up till some years thereafter. In these different\r\n      operations, its duty to the public may sometimes have obliged it, without\r\n      any fault of its directors, to overstock the circulation with paper money.\r\n      It likewise discounts merchants’ bills, and has, upon several different\r\n      occasions, supported the credit of the principal houses, not only of\r\n      England, but of Hamburgh and Holland. Upon one occasion, in 1763, it is\r\n      said to have advanced for this purpose, in one week, about £1,600,000, a\r\n      great part of it in bullion. I do not, however, pretend to warrant either\r\n      the greatness of the sum, or the shortness of the time. Upon other\r\n      occasions, this great company has been reduced to the necessity of paying\r\n      in sixpences.\r\n\r\n      It is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a\r\n      greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwise be\r\n      so, that the most judicious operations of banking can increase the\r\n      industry of the country. That part of his capital which a dealer is\r\n      obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money, for answering\r\n      occasional demands, is so much dead stock, which, so long as it remains in\r\n      this situation, produces nothing, either to him or to his country. The\r\n      judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into\r\n      active and productive stock; into materials to work upon; into tools to\r\n      work with; and into provisions and subsistence to work for; into stock\r\n      which produces something both to himself and to his country. The gold and\r\n      silver money which circulates in any country, and by means of which, the\r\n      produce of its land and labour is annually circulated and distributed to\r\n      the proper consumers, is, in the same manner as the ready money of the\r\n      dealer, all dead stock. It is a very valuable part of the capital of the\r\n      country, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious operations\r\n      of banking, by substituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold\r\n      and silver, enable the country to convert a great part of this dead stock\r\n      into active and productive stock; into stock which produces something to\r\n      the country. The gold and silver money which circulates in any country may\r\n      very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and\r\n      carries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces itself\r\n      not a single pile of either. The judicious operations of banking, by\r\n      providing, if I may be allowed so violent a metaphor, a sort of waggon-way\r\n      through the air, enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part\r\n      of its highways into good pastures, and corn fields, and thereby to\r\n      increase, very considerably, the annual produce of its land and labour.\r\n      The commerce and industry of the country, however, it must be\r\n      acknowledged, though they may be somewhat augmented, cannot be altogether\r\n      so secure, when they are thus, as it were, suspended upon the Daedalian\r\n      wings of paper money, as when they travel about upon the solid ground of\r\n      gold and silver. Over and above the accidents to which they are exposed\r\n      from the unskilfulness of the conductors of this paper money, they are\r\n      liable to several others, from which no prudence or skill of those\r\n      conductors can guard them.\r\n\r\n      An unsuccessful war, for example, in which the enemy got possession of the\r\n      capital, and consequently of that treasure which supported the credit of\r\n      the paper money, would occasion a much greater confusion in a country\r\n      where the whole circulation was carried on by paper, than in one where the\r\n      greater part of it was carried on by gold and silver. The usual instrument\r\n      of commerce having lost its value, no exchanges could be made but either\r\n      by barter or upon credit. All taxes having been usually paid in paper\r\n      money, the prince would not have wherewithal either to pay his troops, or\r\n      to furnish his magazines; and the state of the country would be much more\r\n      irretrievable than if the greater part of its circulation had consisted in\r\n      gold and silver. A prince, anxious to maintain his dominions at all times\r\n      in the state in which he can most easily defend them, ought upon this\r\n      account to guard not only against that excessive multiplication of paper\r\n      money which ruins the very banks which issue it, but even against that\r\n      multiplication of it which enables them to fill the greater part of the\r\n      circulation of the country with it.\r\n\r\n      The circulation of every country may be considered as divided into two\r\n      different branches; the circulation of the dealers with one another, and\r\n      the circulation between the dealers and the consumers. Though the same\r\n      pieces of money, whether paper or metal, may be employed sometimes in the\r\n      one circulation and sometimes in the other; yet as both are constantly\r\n      going on at the same time, each requires a certain stock of money, of one\r\n      kind or another, to carry it on. The value of the goods circulated between\r\n      the different dealers never can exceed the value of those circulated\r\n      between the dealers and the consumers; whatever is bought by the dealers\r\n      being ultimately destined to be sold to the consumers. The circulation\r\n      between the dealers, as it is carried on by wholesale, requires generally\r\n      a pretty large sum for every particular transaction. That between the\r\n      dealers and the consumers, on the contrary, as it is generally carried on\r\n      by retail, frequently requires but very small ones, a shilling, or even a\r\n      halfpenny, being often sufficient. But small sums circulate much faster\r\n      than large ones. A shilling changes masters more frequently than a guinea,\r\n      and a halfpenny more frequently than a shilling. Though the annual\r\n      purchases of all the consumers, therefore, are at least equal in value to\r\n      those of all the dealers, they can generally be transacted with a much\r\n      smaller quantity of money; the same pieces, by a more rapid circulation,\r\n      serving as the instrument of many more purchases of the one kind than of\r\n      the other.\r\n\r\n      Paper money may be so regulated as either to confine itself very much to\r\n      the circulation between the different dealers, or to extend itself\r\n      likewise to a great part of that between the dealers and the consumers.\r\n      Where no bank notes are circulated under £10 value, as in London, paper\r\n      money confines itself very much to the circulation between the dealers.\r\n      When a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a consumer, he is\r\n      generally obliged to change it at the first shop where he has occasion to\r\n      purchase five shillings worth of goods; so that it often returns into the\r\n      hands of a dealer before the consumer has spent the fortieth part of the\r\n      money. Where bank notes are issued for so small sums as 20s. as in\r\n      Scotland, paper money extends itself to a considerable part of the\r\n      circulation between dealers and consumers. Before the Act of parliament\r\n      which put a stop to the circulation of ten and five shilling notes, it\r\n      filled a still greater part of that circulation. In the currencies of\r\n      North America, paper was commonly issued for so small a sum as a shilling,\r\n      and filled almost the whole of that circulation. In some paper currencies\r\n      of Yorkshire, it was issued even for so small a sum as a sixpence.\r\n\r\n      Where the issuing of bank notes for such very small sums is allowed, and\r\n      commonly practised, many mean people are both enabled and encouraged to\r\n      become bankers. A person whose promissory note for £5, or even for 20s.\r\n      would be rejected by every body, will get it to be received without\r\n      scruple when it is issued for so small a sum as a sixpence. But the\r\n      frequent bankruptcies to which such beggarly bankers must be liable, may\r\n      occasion a very considerable inconveniency, and sometimes even a very\r\n      great calamity, to many poor people who had received their notes in\r\n      payment.\r\n\r\n      It were better, perhaps, that no bank notes were issued in any part of the\r\n      kingdom for a smaller sum than £5. Paper money would then, probably,\r\n      confine itself, in every part of the kingdom, to the circulation between\r\n      the different dealers, as much as it does at present in London, where no\r\n      bank notes are issued under £10 value; £5 being, in most part of the\r\n      kingdom, a sum which, though it will purchase, perhaps, little more than\r\n      half the quantity of goods, is as much considered, and is as seldom spent\r\n      all at once, as £10 are amidst the profuse expense of London.\r\n\r\n      Where paper money, it is to be observed, is pretty much confined to the\r\n      circulation between dealers and dealers, as at London, there is always\r\n      plenty of gold and silver. Where it extends itself to a considerable part\r\n      of the circulation between dealers and consumers, as in Scotland, and\r\n      still more in North America, it banishes gold and silver almost entirely\r\n      from the country; almost all the ordinary transactions of its interior\r\n      commerce being thus carried on by paper. The suppression of ten and five\r\n      shilling bank notes, somewhat relieved the scarcity of gold and silver in\r\n      Scotland; and the suppression of twenty shilling notes will probably\r\n      relieve it still more. Those metals are said to have become more abundant\r\n      in America, since the suppression of some of their paper currencies. They\r\n      are said, likewise, to have been more abundant before the institution of\r\n      those currencies.\r\n\r\n      Though paper money should be pretty much confined to the circulation\r\n      between dealers and dealers, yet banks and bankers might still be able to\r\n      give nearly the same assistance to the industry and commerce of the\r\n      country, as they had done when paper money filled almost the whole\r\n      circulation. The ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him, for\r\n      answering occasional demands, is destined altogether for the circulation\r\n      between himself and other dealers of whom he buys goods. He has no\r\n      occasion to keep any by him for the circulation between himself and the\r\n      consumers, who are his customers, and who bring ready money to him,\r\n      instead of taking any from him. Though no paper money, therefore, was\r\n      allowed to be issued, but for such sums as would confine it pretty much to\r\n      the circulation between dealers and dealers; yet partly by discounting\r\n      real bills of exchange, and partly by lending upon cash-accounts, banks\r\n      and bankers might still be able to relieve the greater part of those\r\n      dealers from the necessity of keeping any considerable part of their stock\r\n      by them unemployed, and in ready money, for answering occasional demands.\r\n      They might still be able to give the utmost assistance which banks and\r\n      bankers can with propriety give to traders of every kind.\r\n\r\n      To restrain private people, it may be said, from receiving in payment the\r\n      promissory notes of a banker for any sum, whether great or small, when\r\n      they themselves are willing to receive them; or, to restrain a banker from\r\n      issuing such notes, when all his neighbours are willing to accept of them,\r\n      is a manifest violation of that natural liberty, which it is the proper\r\n      business of law not to infringe, but to support. Such regulations may, no\r\n      doubt, be considered as in some respect a violation of natural liberty.\r\n      But those exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which\r\n      might endanger the security of the whole society, are, and ought to be,\r\n      restrained by the laws of all governments; of the most free, as well as or\r\n      the most despotical. The obligation of building party walls, in order to\r\n      prevent the communication of fire, is a violation of natural liberty,\r\n      exactly of the same kind with the regulations of the banking trade which\r\n      are here proposed.\r\n\r\n      A paper money, consisting in bank notes, issued by people of undoubted\r\n      credit, payable upon demand, without any condition, and, in fact, always\r\n      readily paid as soon as presented, is, in every respect, equal in value to\r\n      gold and silver money, since gold and silver money can at anytime be had\r\n      for it. Whatever is either bought or sold for such paper, must necessarily\r\n      be bought or sold as cheap as it could have been for gold and silver.\r\n\r\n      The increase of paper money, it has been said, by augmenting the quantity,\r\n      and consequently diminishing the value, of the whole currency, necessarily\r\n      augments the money price of commodities. But as the quantity of gold and\r\n      silver, which is taken from the currency, is always equal to the quantity\r\n      of paper which is added to it, paper money does not necessarily increase\r\n      the quantity of the whole currency. From the beginning of the last century\r\n      to the present time, provisions never were cheaper in Scotland than in\r\n      1759, though, from the circulation of ten and five shilling bank notes,\r\n      there was then more paper money in the country than at present. The\r\n      proportion between the price of provisions in Scotland and that in England\r\n      is the same now as before the great multiplication of banking companies in\r\n      Scotland. Corn is, upon most occasions, fully as cheap in England as in\r\n      France, though there is a great deal of paper money in England, and scarce\r\n      any in France. In 1751 and 1752, when Mr Hume published his Political\r\n      Discourses, and soon after the great multiplication of paper money in\r\n      Scotland, there was a very sensible rise in the price of provisions,\r\n      owing, probably, to the badness of the seasons, and not to the\r\n      multiplication of paper money.\r\n\r\n      It would be otherwise, indeed, with a paper money, consisting in\r\n      promissory notes, of which the immediate payment depended, in any respect,\r\n      either upon the good will of those who issued them, or upon a condition\r\n      which the holder of the notes might not always have it in his power to\r\n      fulfil, or of which the payment was not exigible till after a certain\r\n      number of years, and which, in the mean time, bore no interest. Such a\r\n      paper money would, no doubt, fall more or less below the value of gold and\r\n      silver, according as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate\r\n      payment was supposed to be greater or less, or according to the greater or\r\n      less distance of time at which payment was exigible.\r\n\r\n      Some years ago the different banking companies of Scotland were in the\r\n      practice of inserting into their bank notes, what they called an optional\r\n      clause; by which they promised payment to the bearer, either as soon as\r\n      the note should be presented, or, in the option of the directors, six\r\n      months after such presentment, together with the legal interest for the\r\n      said six months. The directors of some of those banks sometimes took\r\n      advantage of this optional clause, and sometimes threatened those who\r\n      demanded gold and silver in exchange for a considerable number of their\r\n      notes, that they would take advantage of it, unless such demanders would\r\n      content themselves with a part of what they demanded. The promissory notes\r\n      of those banking companies constituted, at that time, the far greater part\r\n      of the currency of Scotland, which this uncertainty of payment necessarily\r\n      degraded below value of gold and silver money. During the continuance of\r\n      this abuse (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763, and 1764), while the\r\n      exchange between London and Carlisle was at par, that between London and\r\n      Dumfries would sometimes be four per cent. against Dumfries, though this\r\n      town is not thirty miles distant from Carlisle. But at Carlisle, bills\r\n      were paid in gold and silver; whereas at Dumfries they were paid in Scotch\r\n      bank notes; and the uncertainty of getting these bank notes exchanged for\r\n      gold and silver coin, had thus degraded them four per cent. below the\r\n      value of that coin. The same act of parliament which suppressed ten and\r\n      five shilling bank notes, suppressed likewise this optional clause, and\r\n      thereby restored the exchange between England and Scotland to its natural\r\n      rate, or to what the course of trade and remittances might happen to make\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      In the paper currencies of Yorkshire, the payment of so small a sum as 6d.\r\n      sometimes depended upon the condition, that the holder of the note should\r\n      bring the change of a guinea to the person who issued it; a condition\r\n      which the holders of such notes might frequently find it very difficult to\r\n      fulfil, and which must have degraded this currency below the value of gold\r\n      and silver money. An act of parliament, accordingly, declared all such\r\n      clauses unlawful, and suppressed, in the same manner as in Scotland, all\r\n      promissory notes, payable to the bearer, under 20s. value.\r\n\r\n      The paper currencies of North America consisted, not in bank notes payable\r\n      to the bearer on demand, but in a government paper, of which the payment\r\n      was not exigible till several years after it was issued; and though the\r\n      colony governments paid no interest to the holders of this paper, they\r\n      declared it to be, and in fact rendered it, a legal tender of payment for\r\n      the full value for which it was issued. But allowing the colony security\r\n      to be perfectly good, £100, payable fifteen years hence, for example, in a\r\n      country where interest is at six per cent., is worth little more than £40\r\n      ready money. To oblige a creditor, therefore, to accept of this as full\r\n      payment for a debt of £100, actually paid down in ready money, was an act\r\n      of such violent injustice, as has scarce, perhaps, been attempted by the\r\n      government of any other country which pretended to be free. It bears the\r\n      evident marks of having originally been, what the honest and downright\r\n      Doctor Douglas assures us it was, a scheme of fraudulent debtors to cheat\r\n      their creditors. The government of Pennsylvania, indeed, pretended, upon\r\n      their first emission of paper money, in 1722, to render their paper of\r\n      equal value with gold and silver, by enacting penalties against all those\r\n      who made any difference in the price of their goods when they sold them\r\n      for a colony paper, and when they sold them for gold and silver, a\r\n      regulation equally tyrannical, but much less, effectual, than that which\r\n      it was meant to support. A positive law may render a shilling a legal\r\n      tender for a guinea, because it may direct the courts of justice to\r\n      discharge the debtor who has made that tender; but no positive law can\r\n      oblige a person who sells goods, and who is at liberty to sell or not to\r\n      sell as he pleases, to accept of a shilling as equivalent to a guinea in\r\n      the price of them. Notwithstanding any regulation of this kind, it\r\n      appeared, by the course of exchange with Great Britain, that £100 sterling\r\n      was occasionally considered as equivalent, in some of the colonies, to\r\n      £130, and in others to so great a sum as £1100 currency; this difference\r\n      in the value arising from the difference in the quantity of paper emitted\r\n      in the different colonies, and in the distance and probability of the term\r\n      of its final discharge and redemption.\r\n\r\n      No law, therefore, could be more equitable than the act of parliament, so\r\n      unjustly complained of in the colonies, which declared, that no paper\r\n      currency to be emitted there in time coming, should be a legal tender of\r\n      payment.\r\n\r\n      Pennsylvania was always more moderate in its emissions of paper money than\r\n      any other of our colonies. Its paper currency, accordingly, is said never\r\n      to have sunk below the value of the gold and silver which was current in\r\n      the colony before the first emission of its paper money. Before that\r\n      emission, the colony had raised the denomination of its coin, and had, by\r\n      act of assembly, ordered 5s. sterling to pass in the colonies for 6s:3d.,\r\n      and afterwards for 6s:8d. A pound, colony currency, therefore, even when\r\n      that currency was gold and silver, was more than thirty per cent. below\r\n      the value of £1 sterling; and when that currency was turned into paper, it\r\n      was seldom much more than thirty per cent. below that value. The pretence\r\n      for raising the denomination of the coin was to prevent the exportation of\r\n      gold and silver, by making equal quantities of those metals pass for\r\n      greater sums in the colony than they did in the mother country. It was\r\n      found, however, that the price of all goods from the mother country rose\r\n      exactly in proportion as they raised the denomination of their coin, so\r\n      that their gold and silver were exported as fast as ever.\r\n\r\n      The paper of each colony being received in the payment of the provincial\r\n      taxes, for the full value for which it had been issued, it necessarily\r\n      derived from this use some additional value, over and above what it would\r\n      have had, from the real or supposed distance of the term of its final\r\n      discharge and redemption. This additional value was greater or less,\r\n      according as the quantity of paper issued was more or less above what\r\n      could be employed in the payment of the taxes of the particular colony\r\n      which issued it. It was in all the colonies very much above what could be\r\n      employed in this manner.\r\n\r\n      A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should\r\n      be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain\r\n      value to this paper money, even though the term of its final discharge and\r\n      redemption should depend altogether upon the will of the prince. If the\r\n      bank which issued this paper was careful to keep the quantity of it always\r\n      somewhat below what could easily be employed in this manner, the demand\r\n      for it might be such as to make it even bear a premium, or sell for\r\n      somewhat more in the market than the quantity of gold or silver currency\r\n      for which it was issued. Some people account in this manner for what is\r\n      called the agio of the bank of Amsterdam, or for the superiority of bank\r\n      money over current money, though this bank money, as they pretend, cannot\r\n      be taken out of the bank at the will of the owner. The greater part of\r\n      foreign bills of exchange must be paid in bank money, that is, by a\r\n      transfer in the books of the bank; and the directors of the bank, they\r\n      allege, are careful to keep the whole quantity of bank money always below\r\n      what this use occasions a demand for. It is upon this account, they say,\r\n      the bank money sells for a premium, or bears an agio of four or five per\r\n      cent. above the same nominal sum of the gold and silver currency of the\r\n      country. This account of the bank of Amsterdam, however, it will appear\r\n      hereafter, is in a great measure chimerical.\r\n\r\n      A paper currency which falls below the value of gold and silver coin, does\r\n      not thereby sink the value of those metals, or occasion equal quantities\r\n      of them to exchange for a smaller quantity of goods of any other kind. The\r\n      proportion between the value of gold and silver and that of goods of any\r\n      other kind, depends in all cases, not upon the nature and quantity of any\r\n      particular paper money, which may be current in any particular country,\r\n      but upon the richness or poverty of the mines, which happen at any\r\n      particular time to supply the great market of the commercial world with\r\n      those metals. It depends upon the proportion between the quantity of\r\n      labour which is necessary in order to bring a certain quantity of gold and\r\n      silver to market, and that which is necessary in order to bring thither a\r\n      certain quantity of any other sort of goods.\r\n\r\n      If bankers are restrained from issuing any circulating bank notes, or\r\n      notes payable to the bearer, for less than a certain sum; and if they are\r\n      subjected to the obligation of an immediate and unconditional payment of\r\n      such bank notes as soon as presented, their trade may, with safety to the\r\n      public, be rendered in all other respects perfectly free. The late\r\n      multiplication of banking companies in both parts of the united kingdom,\r\n      an event by which many people have been much alarmed, instead of\r\n      diminishing, increases the security of the public. It obliges all of them\r\n      to be more circumspect in their conduct, and, by not extending their\r\n      currency beyond its due proportion to their cash, to guard themselves\r\n      against those malicious runs, which the rivalship of so many competitors\r\n      is always ready to bring upon them. It restrains the circulation of each\r\n      particular company within a narrower circle, and reduces their circulating\r\n      notes to a smaller number. By dividing the whole circulation into a\r\n      greater number of parts, the failure of any one company, an accident\r\n      which, in the course of things, must sometimes happen, becomes of less\r\n      consequence to the public. This free competition, too, obliges all bankers\r\n      to be more liberal in their dealings with their customers, lest their\r\n      rivals should carry them away. In general, if any branch of trade, or any\r\n      division of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer and more\r\n      general the competition, it will always be the more so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOF THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL, OR OF\r\nPRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      There is one sort of labour which adds to the value of the subject upon\r\n      which it is bestowed; there is another which has no such effect. The\r\n      former as it produces a value, may be called productive, the latter,\r\n      unproductive labour. {Some French authors of great learning and ingenuity\r\n      have used those words in a different sense. In the last chapter of the\r\n      fourth book, I shall endeavour to shew that their sense is an improper\r\n      one.} Thus the labour of a manufacturer adds generally to the value of the\r\n      materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and of his\r\n      master’s profit. The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary, adds to\r\n      the value of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his wages advanced to\r\n      him by his master, he in reality costs him no expense, the value of those\r\n      wages being generally restored, together with a profit, in the improved\r\n      value of the subject upon which his labour is bestowed. But the\r\n      maintenance of a menial servant never is restored. A man grows rich by\r\n      employing a multitude of manufacturers; he grows poor by maintaining a\r\n      multitude or menial servants. The labour of the latter, however, has its\r\n      value, and deserves its reward as well as that of the former. But the\r\n      labour of the manufacturer fixes and realizes itself in some particular\r\n      subject or vendible commodity, which lasts for some time at least after\r\n      that labour is past. It is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour\r\n      stocked and stored up, to be employed, if necessary, upon some other\r\n      occasion. That subject, or, what is the same thing, the price of that\r\n      subject, can afterwards, if necessary, put into motion a quantity of\r\n      labour equal to that which had originally produced it. The labour of the\r\n      menial servant, on the contrary, does not fix or realize itself in any\r\n      particular subject or vendible commodity. His services generally perish in\r\n      the very instant of their performance, and seldom leave any trace of value\r\n      behind them, for which an equal quantity of service could afterwards be\r\n      procured.\r\n\r\n      The labour of some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like\r\n      that of menial servants, unproductive of any value, and does not fix or\r\n      realize itself in any permanent subject, or vendible commodity, which\r\n      endures after that labour is past, and for which an equal quantity of\r\n      labour could afterwards be procured. The sovereign, for example, with all\r\n      the officers both of justice and war who serve under him, the whole army\r\n      and navy, are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the public,\r\n      and are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the industry of\r\n      other people. Their service, how honourable, how useful, or how necessary\r\n      soever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can\r\n      afterwards be procured. The protection, security, and defence, of the\r\n      commonwealth, the effect of their labour this year, will not purchase its\r\n      protection, security, and defence, for the year to come. In the same class\r\n      must be ranked, some both of the gravest and most important, and some of\r\n      the most frivolous professions; churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of\r\n      letters of all kinds; players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers,\r\n      opera-dancers, etc. The labour of the meanest of these has a certain\r\n      value, regulated by the very same principles which regulate that of every\r\n      other sort of labour; and that of the noblest and most useful, produces\r\n      nothing which could afterwards purchase or procure an equal quantity of\r\n      labour. Like the declamation of the actor, the harangue of the orator, or\r\n      the tune of the musician, the work of all of them perishes in the very\r\n      instant of its production.\r\n\r\n      Both productive and unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at\r\n      all, are all equally maintained by the annual produce of the land and\r\n      labour of the country. This produce, how great soever, can never be\r\n      infinite, but must have certain limits. According, therefore, as a smaller\r\n      or greater proportion of it is in any one year employed in maintaining\r\n      unproductive hands, the more in the one case, and the less in the other,\r\n      will remain for the productive, and the next year’s produce will be\r\n      greater or smaller accordingly; the whole annual produce, if we except the\r\n      spontaneous productions of the earth, being the effect of productive\r\n      labour.\r\n\r\n      Though the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country is\r\n      no doubt ultimately destined for supplying the consumption of its\r\n      inhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to them; yet when it first comes\r\n      either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, it\r\n      naturally divides itself into two parts. One of them, and frequently the\r\n      largest, is, in the first place, destined for replacing a capital, or for\r\n      renewing the provisions, materials, and finished work, which had been\r\n      withdrawn from a capital; the other for constituting a revenue either to\r\n      the owner of this capital, as the profit of his stock, or to some other\r\n      person, as the rent of his land. Thus, of the produce of land, one part\r\n      replaces the capital of the farmer; the other pays his profit and the rent\r\n      of the landlord; and thus constitutes a revenue both to the owner of this\r\n      capital, as the profits of his stock, and to some other person as the rent\r\n      of his land. Of the produce of a great manufactory, in the same manner,\r\n      one part, and that always the largest, replaces the capital of the\r\n      undertaker of the work; the other pays his profit, and thus constitutes a\r\n      revenue to the owner of this capital.\r\n\r\n      That part of the annual produce of the land and labour of any country\r\n      which replaces a capital, never is immediately employed to maintain any\r\n      but productive hands. It pays the wages of productive labour only. That\r\n      which is immediately destined for constituting a revenue, either as profit\r\n      or as rent, may maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive\r\n      hands.\r\n\r\n      Whatever part of his stock a man employs as a capital, he always expects\r\n      it to be replaced to him with a profit. He employs it, therefore, in\r\n      maintaining productive hands only; and after having served in the function\r\n      of a capital to him, it constitutes a revenue to them. Whenever he employs\r\n      any part of it in maintaining unproductive hands of any kind, that part is\r\n      from that moment withdrawn from his capital, and placed in his stock\r\n      reserved for immediate consumption.\r\n\r\n      Unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all\r\n      maintained by revenue; either, first, by that part of the annual produce\r\n      which is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some particular\r\n      persons, either as the rent of land, or as the profits of stock; or,\r\n      secondly, by that part which, though originally destined for replacing a\r\n      capital, and for maintaining productive labourers only, yet when it comes\r\n      into their hands, whatever part of it is over and above their necessary\r\n      subsistence, may be employed in maintaining indifferently either\r\n      productive or unproductive hands. Thus, not only the great landlord or the\r\n      rich merchant, but even the common workman, if his wages are considerable,\r\n      may maintain a menial servant; or he may sometimes go to a play or a\r\n      puppet-show, and so contribute his share towards maintaining one set of\r\n      unproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus help to\r\n      maintain another set, more honourable and useful, indeed, but equally\r\n      unproductive. No part of the annual produce, however, which had been\r\n      originally destined to replace a capital, is ever directed towards\r\n      maintaining unproductive hands, till after it has put into motion its full\r\n      complement of productive labour, or all that it could put into motion in\r\n      the way in which it was employed. The workman must have earned his wages\r\n      by work done, before he can employ any part of them in this manner. That\r\n      part, too, is generally but a small one. It is his spare revenue only, of\r\n      which productive labourers have seldom a great deal. They generally have\r\n      some, however; and in the payment of taxes, the greatness of their number\r\n      may compensate, in some measure, the smallness of their contribution. The\r\n      rent of land and the profits of stock are everywhere, therefore, the\r\n      principal sources from which unproductive hands derive their subsistence.\r\n      These are the two sorts of revenue of which the owners have generally most\r\n      to spare. They might both maintain indifferently, either productive or\r\n      unproductive hands. They seem, however, to have some predilection for the\r\n      latter. The expense of a great lord feeds generally more idle than\r\n      industrious people. The rich merchant, though with his capital he\r\n      maintains industrious people only, yet by his expense, that is, by the\r\n      employment of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very same sort as the\r\n      great lord.\r\n\r\n      The proportion, therefore, between the productive and unproductive hands,\r\n      depends very much in every country upon the proportion between that part\r\n      of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from the ground,\r\n      or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined for replacing a\r\n      capital, and that which is destined for constituting a revenue, either as\r\n      rent or as profit. This proportion is very different in rich from what it\r\n      is in poor countries.\r\n\r\n      Thus, at present, in the opulent countries of Europe, a very large,\r\n      frequently the largest, portion of the produce of the land, is destined\r\n      for replacing the capital of the rich and independent farmer; the other\r\n      for paying his profits, and the rent of the landlord. But anciently,\r\n      during the prevalency of the feudal government, a very small portion of\r\n      the produce was sufficient to replace the capital employed in cultivation.\r\n      It consisted commonly in a few wretched cattle, maintained altogether by\r\n      the spontaneous produce of uncultivated land, and which might, therefore,\r\n      be considered as a part of that spontaneous produce. It generally, too,\r\n      belonged to the landlord, and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the\r\n      land. All the rest of the produce properly belonged to him too, either as\r\n      rent for his land, or as profit upon this paltry capital. The occupiers of\r\n      land were generally bond-men, whose persons and effects were equally his\r\n      property. Those who were not bond-men were tenants at will; and though the\r\n      rent which they paid was often nominally little more than a quit-rent, it\r\n      really amounted to the whole produce of the land. Their lord could at all\r\n      times command their labour in peace and their service in war. Though they\r\n      lived at a distance from his house, they were equally dependent upon him\r\n      as his retainers who lived in it. But the whole produce of the land\r\n      undoubtedly belongs to him, who can dispose of the labour and service of\r\n      all those whom it maintains. In the present state of Europe, the share of\r\n      the landlord seldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a fourth part of the\r\n      whole produce of the land. The rent of land, however, in all the improved\r\n      parts of the country, has been tripled and quadrupled since those ancient\r\n      times; and this third or fourth part of the annual produce is, it seems,\r\n      three or four times greater than the whole had been before. In the\r\n      progress of improvement, rent, though it increases in proportion to the\r\n      extent, diminishes in proportion to the produce of the land.\r\n\r\n      In the opulent countries of Europe, great capitals are at present employed\r\n      in trade and manufactures. In the ancient state, the little trade that was\r\n      stirring, and the few homely and coarse manufactures that were carried on,\r\n      required but very small capitals. These, however, must have yielded very\r\n      large profits. The rate of interest was nowhere less than ten per cent.\r\n      and their profits must have been sufficient to afford this great interest.\r\n      At present, the rate of interest, in the improved parts of Europe, is\r\n      nowhere higher than six per cent.; and in some of the most improved, it is\r\n      so low as four, three, and two per cent. Though that part of the revenue\r\n      of the inhabitants which is derived from the profits of stock, is always\r\n      much greater in rich than in poor countries, it is because the stock is\r\n      much greater; in proportion to the stock, the profits are generally much\r\n      less.\r\n\r\n      That part of the annual produce, therefore, which, as soon as it comes\r\n      either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is\r\n      destined for replacing a capital, is not only much greater in rich than in\r\n      poor countries, but bears a much greater proportion to that which is\r\n      immediately destined for constituting a revenue either as rent or as\r\n      profit. The funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour are\r\n      not only much greater in the former than in the latter, but bear a much\r\n      greater proportion to those which, though they may be employed to maintain\r\n      either productive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for\r\n      the latter.\r\n\r\n      The proportion between those different funds necessarily determines in\r\n      every country the general character of the inhabitants as to industry or\r\n      idleness. We are more industrious than our forefathers, because, in the\r\n      present times, the funds destined for the maintenance of industry are much\r\n      greater in proportion to those which are likely to be employed in the\r\n      maintenance of idleness, than they were two or three centuries ago. Our\r\n      ancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to industry. It\r\n      is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing, than to work for\r\n      nothing. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, where the inferior ranks\r\n      of people are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital, they are in\r\n      general industrious, sober, and thriving; as in many English, and in most\r\n      Dutch towns. In those towns which are principally supported by the\r\n      constant or occasional residence of a court, and in which the inferior\r\n      ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue, they\r\n      are in general idle, dissolute, and poor; as at Rome, Versailles,\r\n      Compeigne, and Fontainbleau. If you except Rouen and Bourdeaux, there is\r\n      little trade or industry in any of the parliament towns of France; and the\r\n      inferior ranks of people, being chiefly maintained by the expense of the\r\n      members of the courts of justice, and of those who come to plead before\r\n      them, are in general idle and poor. The great trade of Rouen and Bourdeaux\r\n      seems to be altogether the effect of their situation. Rouen is necessarily\r\n      the entrepot of almost all the goods which are brought either from foreign\r\n      countries, or from the maritime provinces of France, for the consumption\r\n      of the great city of Paris. Bourdeaux is, in the same manner, the entrepot\r\n      of the wines which grow upon the banks of the Garronne, and of the rivers\r\n      which run into it, one of the richest wine countries in the world, and\r\n      which seems to produce the wine fittest for exportation, or best suited to\r\n      the taste of foreign nations. Such advantageous situations necessarily\r\n      attract a great capital by the great employment which they afford it; and\r\n      the employment of this capital is the cause of the industry of those two\r\n      cities. In the other parliament towns of France, very little more capital\r\n      seems to be employed than what is necessary for supplying their own\r\n      consumption; that is, little more than the smallest capital which can be\r\n      employed in them. The same thing may be said of Paris, Madrid, and Vienna.\r\n      Of those three cities, Paris is by far the most industrious, but Paris\r\n      itself is the principal market of all the manufactures established at\r\n      Paris, and its own consumption is the principal object of all the trade\r\n      which it carries on. London, Lisbon, and Copenhagen, are, perhaps, the\r\n      only three cities in Europe, which are both the constant residence of a\r\n      court, and can at the same time be considered as trading cities, or as\r\n      cities which trade not only for their own consumption, but for that of\r\n      other cities and countries. The situation of all the three is extremely\r\n      advantageous, and naturally fits them to be the entrepots of a great part\r\n      of the goods destined for the consumption of distant places. In a city\r\n      where a great revenue is spent, to employ with advantage a capital for any\r\n      other purpose than for supplying the consumption of that city, is probably\r\n      more difficult than in one in which the inferior ranks of people have no\r\n      other maintenance but what they derive from the employment of such a\r\n      capital. The idleness of the greater part of the people who are maintained\r\n      by the expense of revenue, corrupts, it is probable, the industry of those\r\n      who ought to be maintained by the employment of capital, and renders it\r\n      less advantageous to employ a capital there than in other places. There\r\n      was little trade or industry in Edinburgh before the Union. When the\r\n      Scotch parliament was no longer to be assembled in it, when it ceased to\r\n      be the necessary residence of the principal nobility and gentry of\r\n      Scotland, it became a city of some trade and industry. It still continues,\r\n      however, to be the residence of the principal courts of justice in\r\n      Scotland, of the boards of customs and excise, etc. A considerable\r\n      revenue, therefore, still continues to be spent in it. In trade and\r\n      industry, it is much inferior to Glasgow, of which the inhabitants are\r\n      chiefly maintained by the employment of capital. The inhabitants of a\r\n      large village, it has sometimes been observed, after having made\r\n      considerable progress in manufactures, have become idle and poor, in\r\n      consequence of a great lord’s having taken up his residence in their\r\n      neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n      The proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, seems everywhere to\r\n      regulate the proportion between industry and idleness. Wherever capital\r\n      predominates, industry prevails; wherever revenue, idleness. Every\r\n      increase or diminution of capital, therefore, naturally tends to increase\r\n      or diminish the real quantity of industry, the number of productive hands,\r\n      and consequently the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land\r\n      and labour of the country, the real wealth and revenue of all its\r\n      inhabitants.\r\n\r\n      Capitals are increased by parsimony, and diminished by prodigality and\r\n      misconduct.\r\n\r\n      Whatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital, and\r\n      either employs it himself in maintaining an additional number of\r\n      productive hands, or enables some other person to do so, by lending it to\r\n      him for an interest, that is, for a share of the profits. As the capital\r\n      of an individual can be increased only by what he saves from his annual\r\n      revenue or his annual gains, so the capital of a society, which is the\r\n      same with that of all the individuals who compose it, can be increased\r\n      only in the same manner.\r\n\r\n      Parsimony, and not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase of\r\n      capital. Industry, indeed, provides the subject which parsimony\r\n      accumulates; but whatever industry might acquire, if parsimony did not\r\n      save and store up, the capital would never be the greater.\r\n\r\n      Parsimony, by increasing the fund which is destined for the maintenance of\r\n      productive hands, tends to increase the number of those hands whose labour\r\n      adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed. It tends,\r\n      therefore, to increase the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the\r\n      land and labour of the country. It puts into motion an additional quantity\r\n      of industry, which gives an additional value to the annual produce.\r\n\r\n      What is annually saved, is as regularly consumed as what is annually\r\n      spent, and nearly in the same time too: but it is consumed by a different\r\n      set of people. That portion of his revenue which a rich man annually\r\n      spends, is, in most cases, consumed by idle guests and menial servants,\r\n      who leave nothing behind them in return for their consumption. That\r\n      portion which he annually saves, as, for the sake of the profit, it is\r\n      immediately employed as a capital, is consumed in the same manner, and\r\n      nearly in the same time too, but by a different set of people: by\r\n      labourers, manufacturers, and artificers, who reproduce, with a profit,\r\n      the value of their annual consumption. His revenue, we shall suppose, is\r\n      paid him in money. Had he spent the whole, the food, clothing, and\r\n      lodging, which the whole could have purchased, would have been distributed\r\n      among the former set of people. By saving a part of it, as that part is,\r\n      for the sake of the profit, immediately employed as a capital, either by\r\n      himself or by some other person, the food, clothing, and lodging, which\r\n      may be purchased with it, are necessarily reserved for the latter. The\r\n      consumption is the same, but the consumers are different.\r\n\r\n      By what a frugal man annually saves, he not only affords maintenance to an\r\n      additional number of productive hands, for that of the ensuing year, but\r\n      like the founder of a public work-house he establishes, as it were, a\r\n      perpetual fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all times to\r\n      come. The perpetual allotment and destination of this fund, indeed, is not\r\n      always guarded by any positive law, by any trust-right or deed of\r\n      mortmain. It is always guarded, however, by a very powerful principle, the\r\n      plain and evident interest of every individual to whom any share of it\r\n      shall ever belong. No part of it can ever afterwards be employed to\r\n      maintain any but productive hands, without an evident loss to the person\r\n      who thus perverts it from its proper destination.\r\n\r\n      The prodigal perverts it in this manner: By not confining his expense\r\n      within his income, he encroaches upon his capital. Like him who perverts\r\n      the revenues of some pious foundation to profane purposes, he pays the\r\n      wages of idleness with those funds which the frugality of his forefathers\r\n      had, as it were, consecrated to the maintenance of industry. By\r\n      diminishing the funds destined for the employment of productive labour, he\r\n      necessarily diminishes, so far as it depends upon him, the quantity of\r\n      that labour which adds a value to the subject upon which it is bestowed,\r\n      and, consequently, the value of the annual produce of the land and labour\r\n      of the whole country, the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. If\r\n      the prodigality of some were not compensated by the frugality of others,\r\n      the conduct of every prodigal, by feeding the idle with the bread of the\r\n      industrious, would tend not only to beggar himself, but to impoverish his\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      Though the expense of the prodigal should be altogether in home made, and\r\n      no part of it in foreign commodities, its effect upon the productive funds\r\n      of the society would still be the same. Every year there would still be a\r\n      certain quantity of food and clothing, which ought to have maintained\r\n      productive, employed in maintaining unproductive hands. Every year,\r\n      therefore, there would still be some diminution in what would otherwise\r\n      have been the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      This expense, it may be said, indeed, not being in foreign goods, and not\r\n      occasioning any exportation of gold and silver, the same quantity of money\r\n      would remain in the country as before. But if the quantity of food and\r\n      clothing which were thus consumed by unproductive, had been distributed\r\n      among productive hands, they would have reproduced, together with a\r\n      profit, the full value of their consumption. The same quantity of money\r\n      would, in this case, equally have remained in the country, and there\r\n      would, besides, have been a reproduction of an equal value of consumable\r\n      goods. There would have been two values instead of one.\r\n\r\n      The same quantity of money, besides, can not long remain in any country in\r\n      which the value of the annual produce diminishes. The sole use of money is\r\n      to circulate consumable goods. By means of it, provisions, materials, and\r\n      finished work, are bought and sold, and distributed to their proper\r\n      consumers. The quantity of money, therefore, which can be annually\r\n      employed in any country, must be determined by the value of the consumable\r\n      goods annually circulated within it. These must consist, either in the\r\n      immediate produce of the land and labour of the country itself, or in\r\n      something which had been purchased with some part of that produce. Their\r\n      value, therefore, must diminish as the value of that produce diminishes,\r\n      and along with it the quantity of money which can be employed in\r\n      circulating them. But the money which, by this annual diminution of\r\n      produce, is annually thrown out of domestic circulation, will not be\r\n      allowed to lie idle. The interest of whoever possesses it requires that it\r\n      should be employed; but having no employment at home, it will, in spite of\r\n      all laws and prohibitions, be sent abroad, and employed in purchasing\r\n      consumable goods, which may be of some use at home. Its annual exportation\r\n      will, in this manner, continue for some time to add something to the\r\n      annual consumption of the country beyond the value of its own annual\r\n      produce. What in the days of its prosperity had been saved from that\r\n      annual produce, and employed in purchasing gold and silver, will\r\n      contribute, for some little time, to support its consumption in adversity.\r\n      The exportation of gold and silver is, in this case, not the cause, but\r\n      the effect of its declension, and may even, for some little time,\r\n      alleviate the misery of that declension.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of money, on the contrary, must in every country naturally\r\n      increase as the value of the annual produce increases. The value of the\r\n      consumable goods annually circulated within the society being greater,\r\n      will require a greater quantity of money to circulate them. A part of the\r\n      increased produce, therefore, will naturally be employed in purchasing,\r\n      wherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of gold and silver\r\n      necessary for circulating the rest. The increase of those metals will, in\r\n      this case, be the effect, not the cause, of the public prosperity. Gold\r\n      and silver are purchased everywhere in the same manner. The food,\r\n      clothing, and lodging, the revenue and maintenance, of all those whose\r\n      labour or stock is employed in bringing them from the mine to the market,\r\n      is the price paid for them in Peru as well as in England. The country\r\n      which has this price to pay, will never belong without the quantity of\r\n      those metals which it has occasion for; and no country will ever long\r\n      retain a quantity which it has no occasion for.\r\n\r\n      Whatever, therefore, we may imagine the real wealth and revenue of a\r\n      country to consist in, whether in the value of the annual produce of its\r\n      land and labour, as plain reason seems to dictate, or in the quantity of\r\n      the precious metals which circulate within it, as vulgar prejudices\r\n      suppose; in either view of the matter, every prodigal appears to be a\r\n      public enemy, and every frugal man a public benefactor.\r\n\r\n      The effects of misconduct are often the same as those of prodigality.\r\n      Every injudicious and unsuccessful project in agriculture, mines,\r\n      fisheries, trade, or manufactures, tends in the same manner to diminish\r\n      the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour. In every such\r\n      project, though the capital is consumed by productive hands only, yet as,\r\n      by the injudicious manner in which they are employed, they do not\r\n      reproduce the full value of their consumption, there must always be some\r\n      diminution in what would otherwise have been the productive funds of the\r\n      society.\r\n\r\n      It can seldom happen, indeed, that the circumstances of a great nation can\r\n      be much affected either by the prodigality or misconduct of individuals;\r\n      the profusion or imprudence of some being always more than compensated by\r\n      the frugality and good conduct of others.\r\n\r\n      With regard to profusion, the principle which prompts to expense is the\r\n      passion for present enjoyment; which, though sometimes violent and very\r\n      difficult to be restrained, is in general only momentary and occasional.\r\n      But the principle which prompts to save, is the desire of bettering our\r\n      condition; a desire which, though generally calm and dispassionate, comes\r\n      with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go into the grave. In\r\n      the whole interval which separates those two moments, there is scarce,\r\n      perhaps, a single instance, in which any man is so perfectly and\r\n      completely satisfied with his situation, as to be without any wish of\r\n      alteration or improvement of any kind. An augmentation of fortune is the\r\n      means by which the greater part of men propose and wish to better their\r\n      condition. It is the means the most vulgar and the most obvious; and the\r\n      most likely way of augmenting their fortune, is to save and accumulate\r\n      some part of what they acquire, either regularly and annually, or upon\r\n      some extraordinary occasion. Though the principle of expense, therefore,\r\n      prevails in almost all men upon some occasions, and in some men upon\r\n      almost all occasions; yet in the greater part of men, taking the whole\r\n      course of their life at an average, the principle of frugality seems not\r\n      only to predominate, but to predominate very greatly.\r\n\r\n      With regard to misconduct, the number of prudent and successful\r\n      undertakings is everywhere much greater than that of injudicious and\r\n      unsuccessful ones. After all our complaints of the frequency of\r\n      bankruptcies, the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune, make but a\r\n      very small part of the whole number engaged in trade, and all other sorts\r\n      of business; not much more, perhaps, than one in a thousand. Bankruptcy\r\n      is, perhaps, the greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befal an\r\n      innocent man. The greater part of men, therefore, are sufficiently careful\r\n      to avoid it. Some, indeed, do not avoid it; as some do not avoid the\r\n      gallows.\r\n\r\n      Great nations are never impoverished by private, though they sometimes are\r\n      by public prodigality and misconduct. The whole, or almost the whole\r\n      public revenue is, in most countries, employed in maintaining unproductive\r\n      hands. Such are the people who compose a numerous and splendid court, a\r\n      great ecclesiastical establishment, great fleets and armies, who in time\r\n      of peace produce nothing, and in time of war acquire nothing which can\r\n      compensate the expense of maintaining them, even while the war lasts. Such\r\n      people, as they themselves produce nothing, are all maintained by the\r\n      produce of other men’s labour. When multiplied, therefore, to an\r\n      unnecessary number, they may in a particular year consume so great a share\r\n      of this produce, as not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the\r\n      productive labourers, who should reproduce it next year. The next year’s\r\n      produce, therefore, will be less than that of the foregoing; and if the\r\n      same disorder should continue, that of the third year will be still less\r\n      than that of the second. Those unproductive hands who should be maintained\r\n      by a part only of the spare revenue of the people, may consume so great a\r\n      share of their whole revenue, and thereby oblige so great a number to\r\n      encroach upon their capitals, upon the funds destined for the maintenance\r\n      of productive labour, that all the frugality and good conduct of\r\n      individuals may not be able to compensate the waste and degradation of\r\n      produce occasioned by this violent and forced encroachment.\r\n\r\n      This frugality and good conduct, however, is, upon most occasions, it\r\n      appears from experience, sufficient to compensate, not only the private\r\n      prodigality and misconduct of individuals, but the public extravagance of\r\n      government. The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man\r\n      to better his condition, the principle from which public and national, as\r\n      well as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful\r\n      enough to maintain the natural progress of things towards improvement, in\r\n      spite both of the extravagance of government, and of the greatest errors\r\n      of administration. Like the unknown principle of animal life, it\r\n      frequently restores health and vigour to the constitution, in spite not\r\n      only of the disease, but of the absurd prescriptions of the doctor.\r\n\r\n      The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased\r\n      in its value by no other means, but by increasing either the number of its\r\n      productive labourers, or the productive powers of those labourers who had\r\n      before been employed. The number of its productive labourers, it is\r\n      evident, can never be much increased, but in consequence of an increase of\r\n      capital, or of the funds destined for maintaining them. The productive\r\n      powers of the same number of labourers cannot be increased, but in\r\n      consequence either of some addition and improvement to those machines and\r\n      instruments which facilitate and abridge labour, or of more proper\r\n      division and distribution of employment. In either case, an additional\r\n      capital is almost always required. It is by means of an additional capital\r\n      only, that the undertaker of any work can either provide his workmen with\r\n      better machinery, or make a more proper distribution of employment among\r\n      them. When the work to be done consists of a number of parts, to keep\r\n      every man constantly employed in one way, requires a much greater capital\r\n      than where every man is occasionally employed in every different part of\r\n      the work. When we compare, therefore, the state of a nation at two\r\n      different periods, and find that the annual produce of its land and labour\r\n      is evidently greater at the latter than at the former, that its lands are\r\n      better cultivated, its manufactures more numerous and more flourishing,\r\n      and its trade more extensive; we may be assured that its capital must have\r\n      increased during the interval between those two periods, and that more\r\n      must have been added to it by the good conduct of some, than had been\r\n      taken from it either by the private misconduct of others, or by the public\r\n      extravagance of government. But we shall find this to have been the case\r\n      of almost all nations, in all tolerably quiet and peaceable times, even of\r\n      those who have not enjoyed the most prudent and parsimonious governments.\r\n      To form a right judgment of it, indeed, we must compare the state of the\r\n      country at periods somewhat distant from one another. The progress is\r\n      frequently so gradual, that, at near periods, the improvement is not only\r\n      not sensible, but, from the declension either of certain branches of\r\n      industry, or of certain districts of the country, things which sometimes\r\n      happen, though the country in general is in great prosperity, there\r\n      frequently arises a suspicion, that the riches and industry of the whole\r\n      are decaying.\r\n\r\n      The annual produce of the land and labour of England, for example, is\r\n      certainly much greater than it was a little more than a century ago, at\r\n      the restoration of Charles II. Though at present few people, I believe,\r\n      doubt of this, yet during this period five years have seldom passed away,\r\n      in which some book or pamphlet has not been published, written, too, with\r\n      such abilities as to gain some authority with the public, and pretending\r\n      to demonstrate that the wealth of the nation was fast declining; that the\r\n      country was depopulated, agriculture neglected, manufactures decaying, and\r\n      trade undone. Nor have these publications been all party pamphlets, the\r\n      wretched offspring of falsehood and venality. Many of them have been\r\n      written by very candid and very intelligent people, who wrote nothing but\r\n      what they believed, and for no other reason but because they believed it.\r\n\r\n      The annual produce of the land and labour of England, again, was certainly\r\n      much greater at the Restoration than we can suppose it to have been about\r\n      a hundred years before, at the accession of Elizabeth. At this period,\r\n      too, we have all reason to believe, the country was much more advanced in\r\n      improvement, than it had been about a century before, towards the close of\r\n      the dissensions between the houses of York and Lancaster. Even then it\r\n      was, probably, in a better condition than it had been at the Norman\r\n      conquest: and at the Norman conquest, than during the confusion of the\r\n      Saxon heptarchy. Even at this early period, it was certainly a more\r\n      improved country than at the invasion of Julius Caesar, when its\r\n      inhabitants were nearly in the same state with the savages in North\r\n      America.\r\n\r\n      In each of those periods, however, there was not only much private and\r\n      public profusion, many expensive and unnecessary wars, great perversion of\r\n      the annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain unproductive\r\n      hands; but sometimes, in the confusion of civil discord, such absolute\r\n      waste and destruction of stock, as might be supposed, not only to retard,\r\n      as it certainly did, the natural accumulation of riches, but to have left\r\n      the country, at the end of the period, poorer than at the beginning. Thus,\r\n      in the happiest and most fortunate period of them all, that which has\r\n      passed since the Restoration, how many disorders and misfortunes have\r\n      occurred, which, could they have been foreseen, not only the\r\n      impoverishment, but the total ruin of the country would have been expected\r\n      from them? The fire and the plague of London, the two Dutch wars, the\r\n      disorders of the revolution, the war in Ireland, the four expensive French\r\n      wars of 1688, 1701, 1742, and 1756, together with the two rebellions of\r\n      1715 and 1745. In the course of the four French wars, the nation has\r\n      contracted more than £145,000,000 of debt, over and above all the other\r\n      extraordinary annual expense which they occasioned; so that the whole\r\n      cannot be computed at less than £200,000,000. So great a share of the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of the country, has, since the\r\n      Revolution, been employed upon different occasions, in maintaining an\r\n      extraordinary number of unproductive hands. But had not those wars given\r\n      this particular direction to so large a capital, the greater part of it\r\n      would naturally have been employed in maintaining productive hands, whose\r\n      labour would have replaced, with a profit, the whole value of their\r\n      consumption. The value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the\r\n      country would have been considerably increased by it every year, and every\r\n      years increase would have augmented still more that of the following year.\r\n      More houses would have been built, more lands would have been improved,\r\n      and those which had been improved before would have been better\r\n      cultivated; more manufactures would have been established, and those which\r\n      had been established before would have been more extended; and to what\r\n      height the real wealth and revenue of the country might by this time have\r\n      been raised, it is not perhaps very easy even to imagine.\r\n\r\n      But though the profusion of government must undoubtedly have retarded the\r\n      natural progress of England towards wealth and improvement, it has not\r\n      been able to stop it. The annual produce of its land and labour is\r\n      undoubtedly much greater at present than it was either at the Restoration\r\n      or at the Revolution. The capital, therefore, annually employed in\r\n      cultivating this land, and in maintaining this labour, must likewise be\r\n      much greater. In the midst of all the exactions of government, this\r\n      capital has been silently and gradually accumulated by the private\r\n      frugality and good conduct of individuals, by their universal, continual,\r\n      and uninterrupted effort to better their own condition. It is this effort,\r\n      protected by law, and allowed by liberty to exert itself in the manner\r\n      that is most advantageous, which has maintained the progress of England\r\n      towards opulence and improvement in almost all former times, and which, it\r\n      is to be hoped, will do so in all future times. England, however, as it\r\n      has never been blessed with a very parsimonious government, so parsimony\r\n      has at no time been the characteristic virtue of its inhabitants. It is\r\n      the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and\r\n      ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people, and to\r\n      restrain their expense, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the\r\n      importation of foreign luxuries. They are themselves always, and without\r\n      any exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society. Let them look\r\n      well after their own expense, and they may safely trust private people\r\n      with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the state, that of\r\n      the subject never will.\r\n\r\n      As frugality increases, and prodigality diminishes, the public capital, so\r\n      the conduct of those whose expense just equals their revenue, without\r\n      either accumulating or encroaching, neither increases nor diminishes it.\r\n      Some modes of expense, however, seem to contribute more to the growth of\r\n      public opulence than others.\r\n\r\n      The revenue of an individual may be spent, either in things which are\r\n      consumed immediately, and in which one day’s expense can neither alleviate\r\n      nor support that of another; or it may be spent in things mere durable,\r\n      which can therefore be accumulated, and in which every day’s expense may,\r\n      as he chooses, either alleviate, or support and heighten, the effect of\r\n      that of the following day. A man of fortune, for example, may either spend\r\n      his revenue in a profuse and sumptuous table, and in maintaining a great\r\n      number of menial servants, and a multitude of dogs and horses; or,\r\n      contenting himself with a frugal table, and few attendants, he may lay out\r\n      the greater part of it in adorning his house or his country villa, in\r\n      useful or ornamental buildings, in useful or ornamental furniture, in\r\n      collecting books, statues, pictures; or in things more frivolous, jewels,\r\n      baubles, ingenious trinkets of different kinds; or, what is most trifling\r\n      of all, in amassing a great wardrobe of fine clothes, like the favourite\r\n      and minister of a great prince who died a few years ago. Were two men of\r\n      equal fortune to spend their revenue, the one chiefly in the one way, the\r\n      other in the other, the magnificence of the person whose expense had been\r\n      chiefly in durable commodities, would be continually increasing, every\r\n      day’s expense contributing something to support and heighten the effect of\r\n      that of the following day; that of the other, on the contrary, would be no\r\n      greater at the end of the period than at the beginning. The former too\r\n      would, at the end of the period, be the richer man of the two. He would\r\n      have a stock of goods of some kind or other, which, though it might not be\r\n      worth all that it cost, would always be worth something. No trace or\r\n      vestige of the expense of the latter would remain, and the effects of ten\r\n      or twenty years’ profusion would be as completely annihilated as if they\r\n      had never existed.\r\n\r\n      As the one mode of expense is more favourable than the other to the\r\n      opulence of an individual, so is it likewise to that of a nation. The\r\n      houses, the furniture, the clothing of the rich, in a little time, become\r\n      useful to the inferior and middling ranks of people. They are able to\r\n      purchase them when their superiors grow weary of them; and the general\r\n      accommodation of the whole people is thus gradually improved, when this\r\n      mode of expense becomes universal among men of fortune. In countries which\r\n      have long been rich, you will frequently find the inferior ranks of people\r\n      in possession both of houses and furniture perfectly good and entire, but\r\n      of which neither the one could have been built, nor the other have been\r\n      made for their use. What was formerly a seat of the family of Seymour, is\r\n      now an inn upon the Bath road. The marriage-bed of James I. of Great\r\n      Britain, which his queen brought with her from Denmark, as a present fit\r\n      for a sovereign to make to a sovereign, was, a few years ago, the ornament\r\n      of an alehouse at Dunfermline. In some ancient cities, which either have\r\n      been long stationary, or have gone somewhat to decay, you will sometimes\r\n      scarce find a single house which could have been built for its present\r\n      inhabitants. If you go into those houses, too, you will frequently find\r\n      many excellent, though antiquated pieces of furniture, which are still\r\n      very fit for use, and which could as little have been made for them. Noble\r\n      palaces, magnificent villas, great collections of books, statues,\r\n      pictures, and other curiosities, are frequently both an ornament and an\r\n      honour, not only to the neighbourhood, but to the whole country to which\r\n      they belong. Versailles is an ornament and an honour to France, Stowe and\r\n      Wilton to England. Italy still continues to command some sort of\r\n      veneration, by the number of monuments of this kind which it possesses,\r\n      though the wealth which produced them has decayed, and though the genius\r\n      which planned them seems to be extinguished, perhaps from not having the\r\n      same employment.\r\n\r\n      The expense, too, which is laid out in durable commodities, is favourable\r\n      not only to accumulation, but to frugality. If a person should at any time\r\n      exceed in it, he can easily reform without exposing himself to the censure\r\n      of the public. To reduce very much the number of his servants, to reform\r\n      his table from great profusion to great frugality, to lay down his\r\n      equipage after he has once set it up, are changes which cannot escape the\r\n      observation of his neighbours, and which are supposed to imply some\r\n      acknowledgment of preceding bad conduct. Few, therefore, of those who have\r\n      once been so unfortunate as to launch out too far into this sort of\r\n      expense, have afterwards the courage to reform, till ruin and bankruptcy\r\n      oblige them. But if a person has, at any time, been at too great an\r\n      expense in building, in furniture, in books, or pictures, no imprudence\r\n      can be inferred from his changing his conduct. These are things in which\r\n      further expense is frequently rendered unnecessary by former expense; and\r\n      when a person stops short, he appears to do so, not because he has\r\n      exceeded his fortune, but because he has satisfied his fancy.\r\n\r\n      The expense, besides, that is laid out in durable commodities, gives\r\n      maintenance, commonly, to a greater number of people than that which is\r\n      employed in the most profuse hospitality. Of two or three hundred weight\r\n      of provisions, which may sometimes be served up at a great festival, one\r\n      half, perhaps, is thrown to the dunghill, and there is always a great deal\r\n      wasted and abused. But if the expense of this entertainment had been\r\n      employed in setting to work masons, carpenters, upholsterers, mechanics,\r\n      etc. a quantity of provisions of equal value would have been distributed\r\n      among a still greater number of people, who would have bought them in\r\n      pennyworths and pound weights, and not have lost or thrown away a single\r\n      ounce of them. In the one way, besides, this expense maintains productive,\r\n      in the other unproductive hands. In the one way, therefore, it increases,\r\n      in the other it does not increase the exchangeable value of the annual\r\n      produce of the land and labour of the country.\r\n\r\n      I would not, however, by all this, be understood to mean, that the one\r\n      species of expense always betokens a more liberal or generous spirit than\r\n      the other. When a man of fortune spends his revenue chiefly in\r\n      hospitality, he shares the greater part of it with his friends and\r\n      companions; but when he employs it in purchasing such durable commodities,\r\n      he often spends the whole upon his own person, and gives nothing to any\r\n      body without an equivalent. The latter species of expense, therefore,\r\n      especially when directed towards frivolous objects, the little ornaments\r\n      of dress and furniture, jewels, trinkets, gew-gaws, frequently indicates,\r\n      not only a trifling, but a base and selfish disposition. All that I mean\r\n      is, that the one sort of expense, as it always occasions some accumulation\r\n      of valuable commodities, as it is more favourable to private frugality,\r\n      and, consequently, to the increase of the public capital, and as it\r\n      maintains productive rather than unproductive hands, conduces more than\r\n      the other to the growth of public opulence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOF STOCK LENT AT INTEREST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The stock which is lent at interest is always considered as a capital by\r\n      the lender. He expects that in due time it is to be restored to him, and\r\n      that, in the mean time, the borrower is to pay him a certain annual rent\r\n      for the use of it. The borrower may use it either as a capital, or as a\r\n      stock reserved for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he\r\n      employs it in the maintenance of productive labourers, who reproduce the\r\n      value, with a profit. He can, in this case, both restore the capital, and\r\n      pay the interest, without alienating or encroaching upon any other source\r\n      of revenue. If he uses it as a stock reserved for immediate consumption,\r\n      he acts the part of a prodigal, and dissipates, in the maintenance of the\r\n      idle, what was destined for the support of the industrious. He can, in\r\n      this case, neither restore the capital nor pay the interest, without\r\n      either alienating or encroaching upon some other source of revenue, such\r\n      as the property or the rent of land.\r\n\r\n      The stock which is lent at interest is, no doubt, occasionally employed in\r\n      both these ways, but in the former much more frequently than in the\r\n      latter. The man who borrows in order to spend will soon be ruined, and he\r\n      who lends to him will generally have occasion to repent of his folly. To\r\n      borrow or to lend for such a purpose, therefore, is, in all cases, where\r\n      gross usury is out of the question, contrary to the interest of both\r\n      parties; and though it no doubt happens sometimes, that people do both the\r\n      one and the other, yet, from the regard that all men have for their own\r\n      interest, we may be assured, that it cannot happen so very frequently as\r\n      we are sometimes apt to imagine. Ask any rich man of common prudence, to\r\n      which of the two sorts of people he has lent the greater part of his\r\n      stock, to those who he thinks will employ it profitably, or to those who\r\n      will spend it idly, and he will laugh at you for proposing the question.\r\n      Even among borrowers, therefore, not the people in the world most famous\r\n      for frugality, the number of the frugal and industrious surpasses\r\n      considerably that of the prodigal and idle.\r\n\r\n      The only people to whom stock is commonly lent, without their being\r\n      expected to make any very profitable use of it, are country gentlemen, who\r\n      borrow upon mortgage. Even they scarce ever borrow merely to spend. What\r\n      they borrow, one may say, is commonly spent before they borrow it. They\r\n      have generally consumed so great a quantity of goods, advanced to them\r\n      upon credit by shop-keepers and tradesmen, that they find it necessary to\r\n      borrow at interest, in order to pay the debt. The capital borrowed\r\n      replaces the capitals of those shop-keepers and tradesmen which the\r\n      country gentlemen could not have replaced from the rents of their estates.\r\n      It is not properly borrowed in order to be spent, but in order to replace\r\n      a capital which had been spent before.\r\n\r\n      Almost all loans at interest are made in money, either of paper, or of\r\n      gold and silver; but what the borrower really wants, and what the lender\r\n      readily supplies him with, is not the money, but the money’s worth, or the\r\n      goods which it can purchase. If he wants it as a stock for immediate\r\n      consumption, it is those goods only which he can place in that stock. If\r\n      he wants it as a capital for employing industry, it is from those goods\r\n      only that the industrious can be furnished with the tools, materials, and\r\n      maintenance necessary for carrying on their work. By means of the loan,\r\n      the lender, as it were, assigns to the borrower his right to a certain\r\n      portion of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, to be\r\n      employed as the borrower pleases.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of stock, therefore, or, as it is commonly expressed, of\r\n      money, which can be lent at interest in any country, is not regulated by\r\n      the value of the money, whether paper or coin, which serves as the\r\n      instrument of the different loans made in that country, but by the value\r\n      of that part of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from\r\n      the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined,\r\n      not only for replacing a capital, but such a capital as the owner does not\r\n      care to be at the trouble of employing himself. As such capitals are\r\n      commonly lent out and paid back in money, they constitute what is called\r\n      the monied interest. It is distinct, not only from the landed, but from\r\n      the trading and manufacturing interests, as in these last the owners\r\n      themselves employ their own capitals. Even in the monied interest,\r\n      however, the money is, as it were, but the deed of assignment, which\r\n      conveys from one hand to another those capitals which the owners do not\r\n      care to employ themselves. Those capitals may be greater, in almost any\r\n      proportion, than the amount of the money which serves as the instrument of\r\n      their conveyance; the same pieces of money successively serving for many\r\n      different loans, as well as for many different purchases. A, for example,\r\n      lends to W £1000, with which W immediately purchases of B £1000 worth of\r\n      goods. B having no occasion for the money himself, lends the identical\r\n      pieces to X, with which X immediately purchases of C another £1000 worth\r\n      of goods. C, in the same manner, and for the same reason, lends them to Y,\r\n      who again purchases goods with them of D. In this manner, the same pieces,\r\n      either of coin or of paper, may, in the course of a few days, serve as the\r\n      Instrument of three different loans, and of three different purchases,\r\n      each of which is, in value, equal to the whole amount of those pieces.\r\n      What the three monied men, A, B, and C, assigned to the three borrowers,\r\n      W, X, and Y, is the power of making those purchases. In this power consist\r\n      both the value and the use of the loans. The stock lent by the three\r\n      monied men is equal to the value of the goods which can be purchased with\r\n      it, and is three times greater than that of the money with which the\r\n      purchases are made. Those loans, however, may be all perfectly well\r\n      secured, the goods purchased by the different debtors being so employed\r\n      as, in due time, to bring back, with a profit, an equal value either of\r\n      coin or of paper. And as the same pieces of money can thus serve as the\r\n      instrument of different loans to three, or, for the same reason, to thirty\r\n      times their value, so they may likewise successively serve as the\r\n      instrument of repayment.\r\n\r\n      A capital lent at interest may, in this manner, be considered as an\r\n      assignment, from the lender to the borrower, of a certain considerable\r\n      portion of the annual produce, upon condition that the burrower in return\r\n      shall, during the continuance of the loan, annually assign to the lender a\r\n      small portion, called the interest; and, at the end of it, a portion\r\n      equally considerable with that which had originally been assigned to him,\r\n      called the repayment. Though money, either coin or paper, serves generally\r\n      as the deed of assignment, both to the smaller and to the more\r\n      considerable portion, it is itself altogether different from what is\r\n      assigned by it.\r\n\r\n      In proportion as that share of the annual produce which, as soon as it\r\n      comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive\r\n      labourers, is destined for replacing a capital, increases in any country,\r\n      what is called the monied interest naturally increases with it. The\r\n      increase of those particular capitals from which the owners wish to derive\r\n      a revenue, without being at the trouble of employing them themselves,\r\n      naturally accompanies the general increase of capitals; or, in other\r\n      words, as stock increases, the quantity of stock to be lent at interest\r\n      grows gradually greater and greater.\r\n\r\n      As the quantity of stock to be lent at interest increases, the interest,\r\n      or the price which must be paid for the use of that stock, necessarily\r\n      diminishes, not only from those general causes which make the market price\r\n      of things commonly diminish as their quantity increases, but from other\r\n      causes which are peculiar to this particular case. As capitals increase in\r\n      any country, the profits which can be made by employing them necessarily\r\n      diminish. It becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the\r\n      country a profitable method of employing any new capital. There arises, in\r\n      consequence, a competition between different capitals, the owner of one\r\n      endeavouring to get possession of that employment which is occupied by\r\n      another; but, upon most occasions, he can hope to justle that other out of\r\n      this employment by no other means but by dealing upon more reasonable\r\n      terms. He must not only sell what he deals in somewhat cheaper, but, in\r\n      order to get it to sell, he must sometimes, too, buy it dearer. The demand\r\n      for productive labour, by the increase of the funds which are destined for\r\n      maintaining it, grows every day greater and greater. Labourers easily find\r\n      employment; but the owners of capitals find it difficult to get labourers\r\n      to employ. Their competition raises the wages of labour, and sinks the\r\n      profits of stock. But when the profits which can be made by the use of a\r\n      capital are in this manner diminished, as it were, at both ends, the price\r\n      which can be paid for the use of it, that is, the rate of interest, must\r\n      necessarily be diminished with them.\r\n\r\n      Mr Locke, Mr Lawe, and Mr Montesquieu, as well as many other writers, seem\r\n      to have imagined that the increase of the quantity of gold and silver, in\r\n      consequence of the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, was the real\r\n      cause of the lowering of the rate of interest through the greater part of\r\n      Europe. Those metals, they say, having become of less value themselves,\r\n      the use of any particular portion of them necessarily became of less value\r\n      too, and, consequently, the price which could be paid for it. This notion,\r\n      which at first sight seems so plausible, has been so fully exposed by Mr\r\n      Hume, that it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say any thing more about it. The\r\n      following very short and plain argument, however, may serve to explain\r\n      more distinctly the fallacy which seems to have misled those gentlemen.\r\n\r\n      Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, ten per cent. seems to\r\n      have been the common rate of interest through the greater part of Europe.\r\n      It has since that time, in different countries, sunk to six, five, four,\r\n      and three per cent. Let us suppose, that in every particular country the\r\n      value of silver has sunk precisely in the same proportion as the rate of\r\n      interest; and that in those countries, for example, where interest has\r\n      been reduced from ten to five per cent. the same quantity of silver can\r\n      now purchase just half the quantity of goods which it could have purchased\r\n      before. This supposition will not, I believe, be found anywhere agreeable\r\n      to the truth; but it is the most favourable to the opinion which we are\r\n      going to examine; and, even upon this supposition, it is utterly\r\n      impossible that the lowering of the value of silver could have the\r\n      smallest tendency to lower the rate of interest. If £100 are in those\r\n      countries now of no more value than £50 were then, £10 must now be of no\r\n      more value than £5 were then. Whatever were the causes which lowered the\r\n      value of the capital, the same must necessarily have lowered that of the\r\n      interest, and exactly in the same proportion. The proportion between the\r\n      value of the capital and that of the interest must have remained the same,\r\n      though the rate had never been altered. By altering the rate, on the\r\n      contrary, the proportion between those two values is necessarily altered.\r\n      If £100 now are worth no more than £50 were then, £5 now can be worth no\r\n      more than £2:10s. were then. By reducing the rate of interest, therefore,\r\n      from ten to five per cent. we give for the use of a capital, which is\r\n      supposed to be equal to one half of its former value, an interest which is\r\n      equal to one fourth only of the value of the former interest.\r\n\r\n      An increase in the quantity of silver, while that of the commodities\r\n      circulated by means of it remained the same, could have no other effect\r\n      than to diminish the value of that metal. The nominal value of all sorts\r\n      of goods would be greater, but their real value would be precisely the\r\n      same as before. They would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces of\r\n      silver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the number of\r\n      people whom they could maintain and employ, would be precisely the same.\r\n      The capital of the country would be the same, though a greater number of\r\n      pieces might be requisite for conveying any equal portion of it from one\r\n      hand to another. The deeds of assignment, like the conveyances of a\r\n      verbose attorney, would be more cumbersome; but the thing assigned would\r\n      be precisely the same as before, and could produce only the same effects.\r\n      The funds for maintaining productive labour being the same, the demand for\r\n      it would be the same. Its price or wages, therefore, though nominally\r\n      greater, would really be the same. They would be paid in a greater number\r\n      of pieces of silver, but they would purchase only the same quantity of\r\n      goods. The profits of stock would be the same, both nominally and really.\r\n      The wages of labour are commonly computed by the quantity of silver which\r\n      is paid to the labourer. When that is increased, therefore, his wages\r\n      appear to be increased, though they may sometimes be no greater than\r\n      before. But the profits of stock are not computed by the number of pieces\r\n      of silver with which they are paid, but by the proportion which those\r\n      pieces bear to the whole capital employed. Thus, in a particular country,\r\n      5s. a-week are said to be the common wages of labour, and ten per cent.\r\n      the common profits of stock; but the whole capital of the country being\r\n      the same as before, the competition between the different capitals of\r\n      individuals into which it was divided would likewise be the same. They\r\n      would all trade with the same advantages and disadvantages. The common\r\n      proportion between capital and profit, therefore, would be the same, and\r\n      consequently the common interest of money; what can commonly be given for\r\n      the use of money being necessarily regulated by what can commonly be made\r\n      by the use of it.\r\n\r\n      Any increase in the quantity of commodities annually circulated within the\r\n      country, while that of the money which circulated them remained the same,\r\n      would, on the contrary, produce many other important effects, besides that\r\n      of raising the value of the money. The capital of the country, though it\r\n      might nominally be the same, would really be augmented. It might continue\r\n      to be expressed by the same quantity of money, but it would command a\r\n      greater quantity of labour. The quantity of productive labour which it\r\n      could maintain and employ would be increased, and consequently the demand\r\n      for that labour. Its wages would naturally rise with the demand, and yet\r\n      might appear to sink. They might be paid with a smaller quantity of money,\r\n      but that smaller quantity might purchase a greater quantity of goods than\r\n      a greater had done before. The profits of stock would be diminished, both\r\n      really and in appearance. The whole capital of the country being\r\n      augmented, the competition between the different capitals of which it was\r\n      composed would naturally be augmented along with it. The owners of those\r\n      particular capitals would be obliged to content themselves with a smaller\r\n      proportion of the produce of that labour which their respective capitals\r\n      employed. The interest of money, keeping pace always with the profits of\r\n      stock, might, in this manner, be greatly diminished, though the value of\r\n      money, or the quantity of goods which any particular sum could purchase,\r\n      was greatly augmented.\r\n\r\n      In some countries the interest of money has been prohibited by law. But as\r\n      something can everywhere be made by the use of money, something ought\r\n      everywhere to be paid for the use of it. This regulation, instead of\r\n      preventing, has been found from experience to increase the evil of usury.\r\n      The debtor being obliged to pay, not only for the use of the money, but\r\n      for the risk which his creditor runs by accepting a compensation for that\r\n      use, he is obliged, if one may say so, to insure his creditor from the\r\n      penalties of usury.\r\n\r\n      In countries where interest is permitted, the law in order to prevent the\r\n      extortion of usury, generally fixes the highest rate which can be taken\r\n      without incurring a penalty. This rate ought always to be somewhat above\r\n      the lowest market price, or the price which is commonly paid for the use\r\n      of money by those who can give the most undoubted security. If this legal\r\n      rate should be fixed below the lowest market rate, the effects of this\r\n      fixation must be nearly the same as those of a total prohibition of\r\n      interest. The creditor will not lend his money for less than the use of it\r\n      is worth, and the debtor must pay him for the risk which he runs by\r\n      accepting the full value of that use. If it is fixed precisely at the\r\n      lowest market price, it ruins, with honest people who respect the laws of\r\n      their country, the credit of all those who cannot give the very best\r\n      security, and obliges them to have recourse to exorbitant usurers. In a\r\n      country such as Great Britain, where money is lent to government at three\r\n      per cent. and to private people, upon good security, at four and four and\r\n      a-half, the present legal rate, five per cent. is perhaps as proper as\r\n      any.\r\n\r\n      The legal rate, it is to be observed, though it ought to be somewhat\r\n      above, ought not to be much above the lowest market rate. If the legal\r\n      rate of interest in Great Britain, for example, was fixed so high as eight\r\n      or ten per cent. the greater part of the money which was to be lent, would\r\n      be lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to give\r\n      this high interest. Sober people, who will give for the use of money no\r\n      more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it, would\r\n      not venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the\r\n      country would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make\r\n      a profitable and advantageous use of it, and thrown into those which were\r\n      most likely to waste and destroy it. Where the legal rate of interest, on\r\n      the contrary, is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate,\r\n      sober people are universally preferred, as borrowers, to prodigals and\r\n      projectors. The person who lends money gets nearly as much interest from\r\n      the former as he dares to take from the latter, and his money is much\r\n      safer in the hands of the one set of people than in those of the other. A\r\n      great part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in\r\n      which it is most likely to be employed with advantage.\r\n\r\n      No law can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary\r\n      market rate at the time when that law is made. Notwithstanding the edict\r\n      of 1766, by which the French king attempted to reduce the rate of interest\r\n      from five to four per cent. money continued to be lent in France at five\r\n      per cent. the law being evaded in several different ways.\r\n\r\n      The ordinary market price of land, it is to be observed, depends\r\n      everywhere upon the ordinary market rate of interest. The person who has a\r\n      capital from which he wishes to derive a revenue, without taking the\r\n      trouble to employ it himself, deliberates whether he should buy land with\r\n      it, or lend it out at interest. The superior security of land, together\r\n      with some other advantages which almost everywhere attend upon this\r\n      species of property, will generally dispose him to content himself with a\r\n      smaller revenue from land, than what he might have by lending out his\r\n      money at interest. These advantages are sufficient to compensate a certain\r\n      difference of revenue; but they will compensate a certain difference only;\r\n      and if the rent of land should fall short of the interest of money by a\r\n      greater difference, nobody would buy land, which would soon reduce its\r\n      ordinary price. On the contrary, if the advantages should much more than\r\n      compensate the difference, everybody would buy land, which again would\r\n      soon raise its ordinary price. When interest was at ten per cent. land was\r\n      commonly sold for ten or twelve years purchase. As interest sunk to six,\r\n      five, and four per cent. the price of land rose to twenty,\r\n      five-and-twenty, and thirty years purchase. The market rate of interest is\r\n      higher in France than in England, and the common price of land is lower.\r\n      In England it commonly sells at thirty, in France at twenty years\r\n      purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOF THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS OF CAPITALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Though all capitals are destined for the maintenance of productive labour\r\n      only, yet the quantity of that labour which equal capitals are capable of\r\n      putting into motion, varies extremely according to the diversity of their\r\n      employment; as does likewise the value which that employment adds to the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of the country.\r\n\r\n      A capital may be employed in four different ways; either, first, in\r\n      procuring the rude produce annually required for the use and consumption\r\n      of the society; or, secondly, in manufacturing and preparing that rude\r\n      produce for immediate use and consumption; or, thirdly in transporting\r\n      either the rude or manufactured produce from the places where they abound\r\n      to those where they are wanted; or, lastly, in dividing particular\r\n      portions of either into such small parcels as suit the occasional demands\r\n      of those who want them. In the first way are employed the capitals of all\r\n      those who undertake improvement or cultivation of lands, mines, or\r\n      fisheries; in the second, those of all master manufacturers; in the third,\r\n      those of all wholesale merchants; and in the fourth, those of all\r\n      retailers. It is difficult to conceive that a capital should be employed\r\n      in any way which may not be classed under some one or other of those four.\r\n\r\n      Each of those four methods of employing a capital is essentially\r\n      necessary, either to the existence or extension of the other three, or to\r\n      the general conveniency of the society.\r\n\r\n      Unless a capital was employed in furnishing rude produce to a certain\r\n      degree of abundance, neither manufactures nor trade of any kind could\r\n      exist.\r\n\r\n      Unless a capital was employed in manufacturing that part of the rude\r\n      produce which requires a good deal of preparation before it can be fit for\r\n      use and consumption, it either would never be produced, because there\r\n      could be no demand for it; or if it was produced spontaneously, it would\r\n      be of no value in exchange, and could add nothing to the wealth of the\r\n      society.\r\n\r\n      Unless a capital was employed in transporting either the rude or\r\n      manufactured produce from the places where it abounds to those where it is\r\n      wanted, no more of either could be produced than was necessary for the\r\n      consumption of the neighbourhood. The capital of the merchant exchanges\r\n      the surplus produce of one place for that of another, and thus encourages\r\n      the industry, and increases the enjoyments of both.\r\n\r\n      Unless a capital was employed in breaking and dividing certain portions\r\n      either of the rude or manufactured produce into such small parcels as suit\r\n      the occasional demands of those who want them, every man would be obliged\r\n      to purchase a greater quantity of the goods he wanted than his immediate\r\n      occasions required. If there was no such trade as a butcher, for example,\r\n      every man would be obliged to purchase a whole ox or a whole sheep at a\r\n      time. This would generally be inconvenient to the rich, and much more so\r\n      to the poor. If a poor workman was obliged to purchase a month’s or six\r\n      months’ provisions at a time, a great part of the stock which he employs\r\n      as a capital in the instruments of his trade, or in the furniture of his\r\n      shop, and which yields him a revenue, he would be forced to place in that\r\n      part of his stock which is reserved for immediate consumption, and which\r\n      yields him no revenue. Nothing can be more convenient for such a person\r\n      than to be able to purchase his subsistence from day to day, or even from\r\n      hour to hour, as he wants it. He is thereby enabled to employ almost his\r\n      whole stock as a capital. He is thus enabled to furnish work to a greater\r\n      value; and the profit which he makes by it in this way much more than\r\n      compensates the additional price which the profit of the retailer imposes\r\n      upon the goods. The prejudices of some political writers against\r\n      shopkeepers and tradesmen are altogether without foundation. So far is it\r\n      from being necessary either to tax them, or to restrict their numbers,\r\n      that they can never be multiplied so as to hurt the public, though they\r\n      may so as to hurt one another. The quantity of grocery goods, for example,\r\n      which can be sold in a particular town, is limited by the demand of that\r\n      town and its neighbourhood. The capital, therefore, which can be employed\r\n      in the grocery trade, cannot exceed what is sufficient to purchase that\r\n      quantity. If this capital is divided between two different grocers, their\r\n      competition will tend to make both of them sell cheaper than if it were in\r\n      the hands of one only; and if it were divided among twenty, their\r\n      competition would be just so much the greater, and the chance of their\r\n      combining together, in order to raise the price, just so much the less.\r\n      Their competition might, perhaps, ruin some of themselves; but to take\r\n      care of this, is the business of the parties concerned, and it may safely\r\n      be trusted to their discretion. It can never hurt either the consumer or\r\n      the producer; on the contrary, it must tend to make the retailers both\r\n      sell cheaper and buy dearer, than if the whole trade was monopolised by\r\n      one or two persons. Some of them, perhaps, may sometimes decoy a weak\r\n      customer to buy what he has no occasion for. This evil, however, is of too\r\n      little importance to deserve the public attention, nor would it\r\n      necessarily be prevented by restricting their numbers. It is not the\r\n      multitude of alehouses, to give the must suspicious example, that\r\n      occasions a general disposition to drunkenness among the common people;\r\n      but that disposition, arising from other causes, necessarily gives\r\n      employment to a multitude of alehouses.\r\n\r\n      The persons whose capitals are employed in any of those four ways, are\r\n      themselves productive labourers. Their labour, when properly directed,\r\n      fixes and realizes itself in the subject or vendible commodity upon which\r\n      it is bestowed, and generally adds to its price the value at least of\r\n      their own maintenance and consumption. The profits of the farmer, of the\r\n      manufacturer, of the merchant, and retailer, are all drawn from the price\r\n      of the goods which the two first produce, and the two last buy and sell.\r\n      Equal capitals, however, employed in each of those four different ways,\r\n      will immediately put into motion very different quantities of productive\r\n      labour; and augment, too, in very different proportions, the value of the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of the society to which they belong.\r\n\r\n      The capital of the retailer replaces, together with its profits, that of\r\n      the merchant of whom he purchases goods, and thereby enables him to\r\n      continue his business. The retailer himself is the only productive\r\n      labourer whom it immediately employs. In his profit consists the whole\r\n      value which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and\r\n      labour of the society.\r\n\r\n      The capital of the wholesale merchant replaces, together with their\r\n      profits, the capitals of the farmers and manufacturers of whom he\r\n      purchases the rude and manufactured produce which he deals in, and thereby\r\n      enables them to continue their respective trades. It is by this service\r\n      chiefly that he contributes indirectly to support the productive labour of\r\n      the society, and to increase the value of its annual produce. His capital\r\n      employs, too, the sailors and carriers who transport his goods from one\r\n      place to another; and it augments the price of those goods by the value,\r\n      not only of his profits, but of their wages. This is all the productive\r\n      labour which it immediately puts into motion, and all the value which it\r\n      immediately adds to the annual produce. Its operation in both these\r\n      respects is a good deal superior to that of the capital of the retailer.\r\n\r\n      Part of the capital of the master manufacturer is employed as a fixed\r\n      capital in the instruments of his trade, and replaces, together with its\r\n      profits, that of some other artificer of whom he purchases them. Part of\r\n      his circulating capital is employed in purchasing materials, and replaces,\r\n      with their profits, the capitals of the farmers and miners of whom he\r\n      purchases them. But a great part of it is always, either annually, or in a\r\n      much shorter period, distributed among the different workmen whom he\r\n      employs. It augments the value of those materials by their wages, and by\r\n      their masters’ profits upon the whole stock of wages, materials, and\r\n      instruments of trade employed in the business. It puts immediately into\r\n      motion, therefore, a much greater quantity of productive labour, and adds\r\n      a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the\r\n      society, than an equal capital in the hands of any wholesale merchant.\r\n\r\n      No equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour\r\n      than that of the farmer. Not only his labouring servants, but his\r\n      labouring cattle, are productive labourers. In agriculture, too, Nature\r\n      labours along with man; and though her labour costs no expense, its\r\n      produce has its value, as well as that of the most expensive workmen. The\r\n      most important operations of agriculture seem intended, not so much to\r\n      increase, though they do that too, as to direct the fertility of Nature\r\n      towards the production of the plants most profitable to man. A field\r\n      overgrown with briars and brambles, may frequently produce as great a\r\n      quantity of vegetables as the best cultivated vineyard or corn field.\r\n      Planting and tillage frequently regulate more than they animate the active\r\n      fertility of Nature; and after all their labour, a great part of the work\r\n      always remains to be done by her. The labourers and labouring cattle,\r\n      therefore, employed in agriculture, not only occasion, like the workmen in\r\n      manufactures, the reproduction of a value equal to their own consumption,\r\n      or to the capital which employs them, together with its owner’s profits,\r\n      but of a much greater value. Over and above the capital of the farmer, and\r\n      all its profits, they regularly occasion the reproduction of the rent of\r\n      the landlord. This rent may be considered as the produce of those powers\r\n      of Nature, the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer. It is\r\n      greater or smaller, according to the supposed extent of those powers, or,\r\n      in other words, according to the supposed natural or improved fertility of\r\n      the land. It is the work of Nature which remains, after deducting or\r\n      compensating every thing which can be regarded as the work of man. It is\r\n      seldom less than a fourth, and frequently more than a third, of the whole\r\n      produce. No equal quantity of productive labour employed in manufactures,\r\n      can ever occasion so great reproduction. In them Nature does nothing; man\r\n      does all; and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the\r\n      strength of the agents that occasion it. The capital employed in\r\n      agriculture, therefore, not only puts into motion a greater quantity of\r\n      productive labour than any equal capital employed in manufactures; but in\r\n      proportion, too, to the quantity of productive labour which it employs, it\r\n      adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of\r\n      the country, to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. Of all the\r\n      ways in which a capital can be employed, it is by far the most\r\n      advantageous to society.\r\n\r\n      The capitals employed in the agriculture and in the retail trade of any\r\n      society, must always reside within that society. Their employment is\r\n      confined almost to a precise spot, to the farm, and to the shop of the\r\n      retailer. They must generally, too, though there are some exceptions to\r\n      this, belong to resident members of the society.\r\n\r\n      The capital of a wholesale merchant, on the contrary, seems to have no\r\n      fixed or necessary residence anywhere, but may wander about from place to\r\n      place, according as it can either buy cheap or sell dear.\r\n\r\n      The capital of the manufacturer must, no doubt, reside where the\r\n      manufacture is carried on; but where this shall be, is not always\r\n      necessarily determined. It may frequently be at a great distance, both\r\n      from the place where the materials grow, and from that where the complete\r\n      manufacture is consumed. Lyons is very distant, both from the places which\r\n      afford the materials of its manufactures, and from those which consume\r\n      them. The people of fashion in Sicily are clothed in silks made in other\r\n      countries, from the materials which their own produces. Part of the wool\r\n      of Spain is manufactured in Great Britain, and some part of that cloth is\r\n      afterwards sent back to Spain.\r\n\r\n      Whether the merchant whose capital exports the surplus produce of any\r\n      society, be a native or a foreigner, is of very little importance. If he\r\n      is a foreigner, the number of their productive labourers is necessarily\r\n      less than if he had been a native, by one man only; and the value of their\r\n      annual produce, by the profits of that one man. The sailors or carriers\r\n      whom he employs, may still belong indifferently either to his country, or\r\n      to their country, or to some third country, in the same manner as if he\r\n      had been a native. The capital of a foreigner gives a value to their\r\n      surplus produce equally with that of a native, by exchanging it for\r\n      something for which there is a demand at home. It as effectually replaces\r\n      the capital of the person who produces that surplus, and as effectually\r\n      enables him to continue his business, the service by which the capital of\r\n      a wholesale merchant chiefly contributes to support the productive labour,\r\n      and to augment the value of the annual produce of the society to which he\r\n      belongs.\r\n\r\n      It is of more consequence that the capital of the manufacturer should\r\n      reside within the country. It necessarily puts into motion a greater\r\n      quantity of productive labour, and adds a greater value to the annual\r\n      produce of the land and labour of the society. It may, however, be very\r\n      useful to the country, though it should not reside within it. The capitals\r\n      of the British manufacturers who work up the flax and hemp annually\r\n      imported from the coasts of the Baltic, are surely very useful to the\r\n      countries which produce them. Those materials are a part of the surplus\r\n      produce of those countries, which, unless it was annually exchanged for\r\n      something which is in demand there, would be of no value, and would soon\r\n      cease to be produced. The merchants who export it, replace the capitals of\r\n      the people who produce it, and thereby encourage them to continue the\r\n      production; and the British manufacturers replace the capitals of those\r\n      merchants.\r\n\r\n      A particular country, in the same manner as a particular person, may\r\n      frequently not have capital sufficient both to improve and cultivate all\r\n      its lands, to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for\r\n      immediate use and consumption, and to transport the surplus part either of\r\n      the rude or manufactured produce to those distant markets, where it can be\r\n      exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. The\r\n      inhabitants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital\r\n      sufficient to improve and cultivate all their lands. The wool of the\r\n      southern counties of Scotland is, a great part of it, after a long land\r\n      carriage through very bad roads, manufactured in Yorkshire, for want of a\r\n      capital to manufacture it at home. There are many little manufacturing\r\n      towns in Great Britain, of which the inhabitants have not capital\r\n      sufficient to transport the produce of their own industry to those distant\r\n      markets where there is demand and consumption for it. If there are any\r\n      merchants among them, they are, properly, only the agents of wealthier\r\n      merchants who reside in some of the great commercial cities.\r\n\r\n      When the capital of any country is not sufficient for all those three\r\n      purposes, in proportion as a greater share of it is employed in\r\n      agriculture, the greater will be the quantity of productive labour which\r\n      it puts into motion within the country; as will likewise be the value\r\n      which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labour of\r\n      the society. After agriculture, the capital employed in manufactures puts\r\n      into motion the greatest quantity of productive labour, and adds the\r\n      greatest value to the annual produce. That which is employed in the trade\r\n      of exportation has the least effect of any of the three.\r\n\r\n      The country, indeed, which has not capital sufficient for all those three\r\n      purposes, has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems\r\n      naturally destined. To attempt, however, prematurely, and with an\r\n      insufficient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the shortest\r\n      way for a society, no more than it would be for an individual, to acquire\r\n      a sufficient one. The capital of all the individuals of a nation has its\r\n      limits, in the same manner as that of a single individual, and is capable\r\n      of executing only certain purposes. The capital of all the individuals of\r\n      a nation is increased in the same manner as that of a single individual,\r\n      by their continually accumulating and adding to it whatever they save out\r\n      of their revenue. It is likely to increase the fastest, therefore, when it\r\n      is employed in the way that affords the greatest revenue to all the\r\n      inhabitants or the country, as they will thus be enabled to make the\r\n      greatest savings. But the revenue of all the inhabitants of the country is\r\n      necessarily in proportion to the value of the annual produce of their land\r\n      and labour.\r\n\r\n      It has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American\r\n      colonies towards wealth and greatness, that almost their whole capitals\r\n      have hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures,\r\n      those household and coarser manufactures excepted, which necessarily\r\n      accompany the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the women\r\n      and children in every private family. The greater part, both of the\r\n      exportation and coasting trade of America, is carried on by the capitals\r\n      of merchants who reside in Great Britain. Even the stores and warehouses\r\n      from which goods are retailed in some provinces, particularly in Virginia\r\n      and Maryland, belong many of them to merchants who reside in the mother\r\n      country, and afford one of the few instances of the retail trade of a\r\n      society being carried on by the capitals of those who are not resident\r\n      members of it. Were the Americans, either by combination, or by any other\r\n      sort of violence, to stop the importation of European manufactures, and,\r\n      by thus giving a monopoly to such of their own countrymen as could\r\n      manufacture the like goods, divert any considerable part of their capital\r\n      into this employment, they would retard, instead of accelerating, the\r\n      further increase in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct,\r\n      instead of promoting, the progress of their country towards real wealth\r\n      and greatness. This would be still more the case, were they to attempt, in\r\n      the same manner, to monopolize to themselves their whole exportation\r\n      trade.\r\n\r\n      The course of human prosperity, indeed, seems scarce ever to have been of\r\n      so long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire capital\r\n      sufficient for all those three purposes; unless, perhaps, we give credit\r\n      to the wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of China, of those\r\n      of ancient Egypt, and of the ancient state of Indostan. Even those three\r\n      countries, the wealthiest, according to all accounts, that ever were in\r\n      the world, are chiefly renowned for their superiority in agriculture and\r\n      manufactures. They do not appear to have been eminent for foreign trade.\r\n      The ancient Egyptians had a superstitious antipathy to the sea; a\r\n      superstition nearly of the same kind prevails among the Indians; and the\r\n      Chinese have never excelled in foreign commerce. The greater part of the\r\n      surplus produce of all those three countries seems to have been always\r\n      exported by foreigners, who gave in exchange for it something else, for\r\n      which they found a demand there, frequently gold and silver.\r\n\r\n      It is thus that the same capital will in any country put into motion a\r\n      greater or smaller quantity of productive labour, and add a greater or\r\n      smaller value to the annual produce of its land and labour, according to\r\n      the different proportions in which it is employed in agriculture,\r\n      manufactures, and wholesale trade. The difference, too, is very great,\r\n      according to the different sorts of wholesale trade in which any part of\r\n      it is employed.\r\n\r\n      All wholesale trade, all buying in order to sell again by wholesale, maybe\r\n      reduced to three different sorts: the home trade, the foreign trade of\r\n      consumption, and the carrying trade. The home trade is employed in\r\n      purchasing in one part of the same country, and selling in another, the\r\n      produce of the industry of that country. It comprehends both the inland\r\n      and the coasting trade. The foreign trade of consumption is employed in\r\n      purchasing foreign goods for home consumption. The carrying trade is\r\n      employed in transacting the commerce of foreign countries, or in carrying\r\n      the surplus produce of one to another.\r\n\r\n      The capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the country, in\r\n      order to sell in another, the produce of the industry of that country,\r\n      generally replaces, by every such operation, two distinct capitals, that\r\n      had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country,\r\n      and thereby enables them to continue that employment. When it sends out\r\n      from the residence of the merchant a certain value of commodities, it\r\n      generally brings back in return at least an equal value of other\r\n      commodities. When both are the produce of domestic industry, it\r\n      necessarily replaces, by every such operation, two distinct capitals,\r\n      which had both been employed in supporting productive labour, and thereby\r\n      enables them to continue that support. The capital which sends Scotch\r\n      manufactures to London, and brings back English corn and manufactures to\r\n      Edinburgh, necessarily replaces, by every such operation, two British\r\n      capitals, which had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures\r\n      of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption,\r\n      when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry,\r\n      replaces, too, by every such operation, two distinct capitals; but one of\r\n      them only is employed in supporting domestic industry. The capital which\r\n      sends British goods to Portugal, and brings back Portuguese goods to Great\r\n      Britain, replaces, by every such operation, only one British capital. The\r\n      other is a Portuguese one. Though the returns, therefore, of the foreign\r\n      trade of consumption, should be as quick as those of the home trade, the\r\n      capital employed in it will give but one half of the encouragement to the\r\n      industry or productive labour of the country.\r\n\r\n      But the returns of the foreign trade of consumption are very seldom so\r\n      quick as those of the home trade. The returns of the home trade generally\r\n      come in before the end of the year, and sometimes three or four times in\r\n      the year. The returns of the foreign trade of consumption seldom come in\r\n      before the end of the year, and sometimes not till after two or three\r\n      years. A capital, therefore, employed in the home trade, will sometimes\r\n      make twelve operations, or be sent out and returned twelve times, before a\r\n      capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption has made one. If the\r\n      capitals are equal, therefore, the one will give four-and-twenty times\r\n      more encouragement and support to the industry of the country than the\r\n      other.\r\n\r\n      The foreign goods for home consumption may sometimes be purchased, not\r\n      with the produce of domestic industry but with some other foreign goods.\r\n      These last, however, must have been purchased, either immediately with the\r\n      produce of domestic industry, or with something else that had been\r\n      purchased with it; for, the case of war and conquest excepted, foreign\r\n      goods can never be acquired, but in exchange for something that had been\r\n      produced at home, either immediately, or after two or more different\r\n      exchanges. The effects, therefore, of a capital employed in such a\r\n      round-about foreign trade of consumption, are, in every respect, the same\r\n      as those of one employed in the most direct trade of the same kind, except\r\n      that the final returns are likely to be still more distant, as they must\r\n      depend upon the returns of two or three distinct foreign trades. If the\r\n      hemp and flax of Riga are purchased with the tobacco of Virginia, which\r\n      had been purchased with British manufactures, the merchant must wait for\r\n      the returns of two distinct foreign trades, before he can employ the same\r\n      capital in repurchasing a like quantity of British manufactures. If the\r\n      tobacco of Virginia had been purchased, not with British manufactures, but\r\n      with the sugar and rum of Jamaica, which had been purchased with those\r\n      manufactures, he must wait for the returns of three. If those two or three\r\n      distinct foreign trades should happen to be carried on by two or three\r\n      distinct merchants, of whom the second buys the goods imported by the\r\n      first, and the third buys those imported by the second, in order to export\r\n      them again, each merchant, indeed, will, in this case, receive the returns\r\n      of his own capital more quickly; but the final returns of the whole\r\n      capital employed in the trade will be just as slow as ever. Whether the\r\n      whole capital employed in such a round about trade belong to one merchant\r\n      or to three, can make no difference with regard to the country, though it\r\n      may with regard to the particular merchants. Three times a greater capital\r\n      must in both cases be employed, in order to exchange a certain value of\r\n      British manufactures for a certain quantity of flax and hemp, than would\r\n      have been necessary, had the manufactures and the flax and hemp been\r\n      directly exchanged for one another. The whole capital employed, therefore,\r\n      in such a round-about foreign trade of consumption, will generally give\r\n      less encouragement and support to the productive labour of the country,\r\n      than an equal capital employed in a more direct trade of the same kind.\r\n\r\n      Whatever be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods for home\r\n      consumption are purchased, it can occasion no essential difference, either\r\n      in the nature of the trade, or in the encouragement and support which it\r\n      can give to the productive labour of the country from which it is carried\r\n      on. If they are purchased with the gold of Brazil, for example, or with\r\n      the silver of Peru, this gold and silver, like the tobacco of Virginia,\r\n      must have been purchased with something that either was the produce of the\r\n      industry of the country, or that had been purchased with something else\r\n      that was so. So far, therefore, as the productive labour of the country is\r\n      concerned, the foreign trade of consumption, which is carried on by means\r\n      of gold and silver, has all the advantages and all the inconveniencies of\r\n      any other equally round-about foreign trade of consumption; and will\r\n      replace, just as fast, or just as slow, the capital which is immediately\r\n      employed in supporting that productive labour. It seems even to have one\r\n      advantage over any other equally round-about foreign trade. The\r\n      transportation of those metals from one place to another, on account of\r\n      their small bulk and great value, is less expensive than that of almost\r\n      any other foreign goods of equal value. Their freight is much less, and\r\n      their insurance not greater; and no goods, besides, are less liable to\r\n      suffer by the carriage. An equal quantity of foreign goods, therefore, may\r\n      frequently be purchased with a smaller quantity of the produce of domestic\r\n      industry, by the intervention of gold and silver, than by that of any\r\n      other foreign goods. The demand of the country may frequently, in this\r\n      manner, be supplied more completely, and at a smaller expense, than in any\r\n      other. Whether, by the continual exportation of those metals, a trade of\r\n      this kind is likely to impoverish the country from which it is carried on\r\n      in any other way, I shall have occasion to examine at great length\r\n      hereafter.\r\n\r\n      That part of the capital of any country which is employed in the carrying\r\n      trade, is altogether withdrawn from supporting the productive labour of\r\n      that particular country, to support that of some foreign countries. Though\r\n      it may replace, by every operation, two distinct capitals, yet neither of\r\n      them belongs to that particular country. The capital of the Dutch\r\n      merchant, which carries the corn of Poland to Portugal, and brings back\r\n      the fruits and wines of Portugal to Poland, replaces by every such\r\n      operation two capitals, neither of which had been employed in supporting\r\n      the productive labour of Holland; but one of them in supporting that of\r\n      Poland, and the other that of Portugal. The profits only return regularly\r\n      to Holland, and constitute the whole addition which this trade necessarily\r\n      makes to the annual produce of the land and labour of that country. When,\r\n      indeed, the carrying trade of any particular country is carried on with\r\n      the ships and sailors of that country, that part of the capital employed\r\n      in it which pays the freight is distributed among, and puts into motion, a\r\n      certain number of productive labourers of that country. Almost all nations\r\n      that have had any considerable share of the carrying trade have, in fact,\r\n      carried it on in this manner. The trade itself has probably derived its\r\n      name from it, the people of such countries being the carriers to other\r\n      countries. It does not, however, seem essential to the nature of the trade\r\n      that it should be so. A Dutch merchant may, for example, employ his\r\n      capital in transacting the commerce of Poland and Portugal, by carrying\r\n      part of the surplus produce of the one to the other, not in Dutch, but in\r\n      British bottoms. It maybe presumed, that he actually does so upon some\r\n      particular occasions. It is upon this account, however, that the carrying\r\n      trade has been supposed peculiarly advantageous to such a country as Great\r\n      Britain, of which the defence and security depend upon the number of its\r\n      sailors and shipping. But the same capital may employ as many sailors and\r\n      shipping, either in the foreign trade of consumption, or even in the home\r\n      trade, when carried on by coasting vessels, as it could in the carrying\r\n      trade. The number of sailors and shipping which any particular capital can\r\n      employ, does not depend upon the nature of the trade, but partly upon the\r\n      bulk of the goods, in proportion to their value, and partly upon the\r\n      distance of the ports between which they are to be carried; chiefly upon\r\n      the former of those two circumstances. The coal trade from Newcastle to\r\n      London, for example, employs more shipping than all the carrying trade of\r\n      England, though the ports are at no great distance. To force, therefore,\r\n      by extraordinary encouragements, a larger share of the capital of any\r\n      country into the carrying trade, than what would naturally go to it, will\r\n      not always necessarily increase the shipping of that country.\r\n\r\n      The capital, therefore, employed in the home trade of any country, will\r\n      generally give encouragement and support to a greater quantity of\r\n      productive labour in that country, and increase the value of its annual\r\n      produce, more than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of\r\n      consumption; and the capital employed in this latter trade has, in both\r\n      these respects, a still greater advantage over an equal capital employed\r\n      in the carrying trade. The riches, and so far as power depends upon\r\n      riches, the power of every country must always be in proportion to the\r\n      value of its annual produce, the fund from which all taxes must ultimately\r\n      be paid. But the great object of the political economy of every country,\r\n      is to increase the riches and power of that country. It ought, therefore,\r\n      to give no preference nor superior encouragement to the foreign trade of\r\n      consumption above the home trade, nor to the carrying trade above either\r\n      of the other two. It ought neither to force nor to allure into either of\r\n      those two channels a greater share of the capital of the country, than\r\n      what would naturally flow into them of its own accord.\r\n\r\n      Each of those different branches of trade, however, is not only\r\n      advantageous, but necessary and unavoidable, when the course of things,\r\n      without any constraint or violence, naturally introduces it.\r\n\r\n      When the produce of any particular branch of industry exceeds what the\r\n      demand of the country requires, the surplus must be sent abroad, and\r\n      exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. Without such\r\n      exportation, a part of the productive labour of the country must cease,\r\n      and the value of its annual produce diminish. The land and labour of Great\r\n      Britain produce generally more corn, woollens, and hardware, than the\r\n      demand of the home market requires. The surplus part of them, therefore,\r\n      must be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a\r\n      demand at home. It is only by means of such exportation, that this surplus\r\n      can acquire a value sufficient to compensate the labour and expense of\r\n      producing it. The neighbourhood of the sea-coast, and the banks of all\r\n      navigable rivers, are advantageous situations for industry, only because\r\n      they facilitate the exportation and exchange of such surplus produce for\r\n      something else which is more in demand there.\r\n\r\n      When the foreign goods which are thus purchased with the surplus produce\r\n      of domestic industry exceed the demand of the home market, the surplus\r\n      part of them must be sent abroad again, and exchanged for something more\r\n      in demand at home. About 96,000 hogsheads of tobacco are annually\r\n      purchased in Virginia and Maryland with a part of the surplus produce of\r\n      British industry. But the demand of Great Britain does not require,\r\n      perhaps, more than 14,000. If the remaining 82,000, therefore, could not\r\n      be sent abroad, and exchanged for something more in demand at home, the\r\n      importation of them must cease immediately, and with it the productive\r\n      labour of all those inhabitants of Great Britain who are at present\r\n      employed in preparing the goods with which these 82,000 hogsheads are\r\n      annually purchased. Those goods, which are part of the produce of the land\r\n      and labour of Great Britain, having no market at home, and being deprived\r\n      of that which they had abroad, must cease to be produced. The most\r\n      round-about foreign trade of consumption, therefore, may, upon some\r\n      occasions, be as necessary for supporting the productive labour of the\r\n      country, and the value of its annual produce, as the most direct.\r\n\r\n      When the capital stock of any country is increased to such a degree that\r\n      it cannot be all employed in supplying the consumption, and supporting the\r\n      productive labour of that particular country, the surplus part of it\r\n      naturally disgorges itself into the carrying trade, and is employed in\r\n      performing the same offices to other countries. The carrying trade is the\r\n      natural effect and symptom of great national wealth; but it does not seem\r\n      to be the natural cause of it. Those statesmen who have been disposed to\r\n      favour it with particular encouragement, seem to have mistaken the effect\r\n      and symptom for the cause. Holland, in proportion to the extent of the\r\n      land and the number of its inhabitants, by far the richest country in\r\n      Europe, has accordingly the greatest share of the carrying trade of\r\n      Europe. England, perhaps the second richest country of Europe, is likewise\r\n      supposed to have a considerable share in it; though what commonly passes\r\n      for the carrying trade of England will frequently, perhaps, be found to be\r\n      no more than a round-about foreign trade of consumption. Such are, in a\r\n      great measure, the trades which carry the goods of the East and West\r\n      Indies and of America to the different European markets. Those goods are\r\n      generally purchased, either immediately with the produce of British\r\n      industry, or with something else which had been purchased with that\r\n      produce, and the final returns of those trades are generally used or\r\n      consumed in Great Britain. The trade which is carried on in British\r\n      bottoms between the different ports of the Mediterranean, and some trade\r\n      of the same kind carried on by British merchants between the different\r\n      ports of India, make, perhaps, the principal branches of what is properly\r\n      the carrying trade of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      The extent of the home trade, and of the capital which can be employed in\r\n      it, is necessarily limited by the value of the surplus produce of all\r\n      those distant places within the country which have occasion to exchange\r\n      their respective productions with one another; that of the foreign trade\r\n      of consumption, by the value of the surplus produce of the whole country,\r\n      and of what can be purchased with it; that of the carrying trade, by the\r\n      value of the surplus produce of all the different countries in the world.\r\n      Its possible extent, therefore, is in a manner infinite in comparison of\r\n      that of the other two, and is capable of absorbing the greatest capitals.\r\n\r\n      The consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which\r\n      determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture, in\r\n      manufactures, or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail\r\n      trade. The different quantities of productive labour which it may put into\r\n      motion, and the different values which it may add to the annual produce of\r\n      the land and labour of the society, according as it is employed in one or\r\n      other of those different ways, never enter into his thoughts. In\r\n      countries, therefore, where agriculture is the most profitable of all\r\n      employments, and farming and improving the most direct roads to a splendid\r\n      fortune, the capitals of individuals will naturally be employed in the\r\n      manner most advantageous to the whole society. The profits of agriculture,\r\n      however, seem to have no superiority over those of other employments in\r\n      any part of Europe. Projectors, indeed, in every corner of it, have,\r\n      within these few years, amused the public with most magnificent accounts\r\n      of the profits to be made by the cultivation and improvement of land.\r\n      Without entering into any particular discussion of their calculations, a\r\n      very simple observation may satisfy us that the result of them must be\r\n      false. We see, every day, the most splendid fortunes, that have been\r\n      acquired in the course of a single life, by trade and manufactures,\r\n      frequently from a very small capital, sometimes from no capital. A single\r\n      instance of such a fortune, acquired by agriculture in the same time, and\r\n      from such a capital, has not, perhaps, occurred in Europe, during the\r\n      course of the present century. In all the great countries of Europe,\r\n      however, much good land still remains uncultivated; and the greater part\r\n      of what is cultivated, is far from being improved to the degree of which\r\n      it is capable. Agriculture, therefore, is almost everywhere capable of\r\n      absorbing a much greater capital than has ever yet been employed in it.\r\n      What circumstances in the policy of Europe have given the trades which are\r\n      carried on in towns so great an advantage over that which is carried on in\r\n      the country, that private persons frequently find it more for their\r\n      advantage to employ their capitals in the most distant carrying trades of\r\n      Asia and America than in the improvement and cultivation of the most\r\n      fertile fields in their own neighbourhood, I shall endeavour to explain at\r\n      full length in the two following books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\nOF THE DIFFERENT PROGRESS OF OPULENCE IN\r\nDIFFERENT NATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOF THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF OPULENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on between\r\n      the inhabitants of the town and those of the country. It consists in the\r\n      exchange of rude for manufactured produce, either immediately, or by the\r\n      intervention of money, or of some sort of paper which represents money.\r\n      The country supplies the town with the means of subsistence and the\r\n      materials of manufacture. The town repays this supply, by sending back a\r\n      part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country. The\r\n      town, in which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of substances,\r\n      may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistence from\r\n      the country. We must not, however, upon this account, imagine that the\r\n      gain of the town is the loss of the country. The gains of both are mutual\r\n      and reciprocal, and the division of labour is in this, as in all other\r\n      cases, advantageous to all the different persons employed in the various\r\n      occupations into which it is subdivided. The inhabitants of the country\r\n      purchase of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the\r\n      produce of a much smaller quantity of their own labour, than they must\r\n      have employed had they attempted to prepare them themselves. The town\r\n      affords a market for the surplus produce of the country, or what is over\r\n      and above the maintenance of the cultivators; and it is there that the\r\n      inhabitants of the country exchange it for something else which is in\r\n      demand among them. The greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants\r\n      of the town, the more extensive is the market which it affords to those of\r\n      the country; and the more extensive that market, it is always the more\r\n      advantageous to a great number. The corn which grows within a mile of the\r\n      town, sells there for the same price with that which comes from twenty\r\n      miles distance. But the price of the latter must, generally, not only pay\r\n      the expense of raising it and bringing it to market, but afford, too, the\r\n      ordinary profits of agriculture to the farmer. The proprietors and\r\n      cultivators of the country, therefore, which lies in the neighbourhood of\r\n      the town, over and above the ordinary profits of agriculture, gain, in the\r\n      price of what they sell, the whole value of the carriage of the like\r\n      produce that is brought from more distant parts; and they save, besides,\r\n      the whole value of this carriage in the price of what they buy. Compare\r\n      the cultivation of the lands in the neighbourhood of any considerable\r\n      town, with that of those which lie at some distance from it, and you will\r\n      easily satisfy yourself how much the country is benefited by the commerce\r\n      of the town. Among all the absurd speculations that have been propagated\r\n      concerning the balance of trade, it has never been pretended that either\r\n      the country loses by its commerce with the town, or the town by that with\r\n      the country which maintains it.\r\n\r\n      As subsistence is, in the nature of things, prior to conveniency and\r\n      luxury, so the industry which procures the former, must necessarily be\r\n      prior to that which ministers to the latter. The cultivation and\r\n      improvement of the country, therefore, which affords subsistence, must,\r\n      necessarily, be prior to the increase of the town, which furnishes only\r\n      the means of conveniency and luxury. It is the surplus produce of the\r\n      country only, or what is over and above the maintenance of the\r\n      cultivators, that constitutes the subsistence of the town, which can\r\n      therefore increase only with the increase of the surplus produce. The\r\n      town, indeed, may not always derive its whole subsistence from the country\r\n      in its neighbourhood, or even from the territory to which it belongs, but\r\n      from very distant countries; and this, though it forms no exception from\r\n      the general rule, has occasioned considerable variations in the progress\r\n      of opulence in different ages and nations.\r\n\r\n      That order of things which necessity imposes, in general, though not in\r\n      every particular country, is in every particular country promoted by the\r\n      natural inclinations of man. If human institutions had never thwarted\r\n      those natural inclinations, the towns could nowhere have increased beyond\r\n      what the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which they were\r\n      situated could support; till such time, at least, as the whole of that\r\n      territory was completely cultivated and improved. Upon equal, or nearly\r\n      equal profits, most men will choose to employ their capitals, rather in\r\n      the improvement and cultivation of land, than either in manufactures or in\r\n      foreign trade. The man who employs his capital in land, has it more under\r\n      his view and command; and his fortune is much less liable to accidents\r\n      than that of the trader, who is obliged frequently to commit it, not only\r\n      to the winds and the waves, but to the more uncertain elements of human\r\n      folly and injustice, by giving great credits, in distant countries, to men\r\n      with whose character and situation he can seldom be thoroughly acquainted.\r\n      The capital of the landlord, on the contrary, which is fixed in the\r\n      improvement of his land, seems to be as well secured as the nature of\r\n      human affairs can admit of. The beauty of the country, besides, the\r\n      pleasure of a country life, the tranquillity of mind which it promises,\r\n      and, wherever the injustice of human laws does not disturb it, the\r\n      independency which it really affords, have charms that, more or less,\r\n      attract everybody; and as to cultivate the ground was the original\r\n      destination of man, so, in every stage of his existence, he seems to\r\n      retain a predilection for this primitive employment.\r\n\r\n      Without the assistance of some artificers, indeed, the cultivation of land\r\n      cannot be carried on, but with great inconveniency and continual\r\n      interruption. Smiths, carpenters, wheelwrights and ploughwrights, masons\r\n      and bricklayers, tanners, shoemakers, and tailors, are people whose\r\n      service the farmer has frequent occasion for. Such artificers, too, stand\r\n      occasionally in need of the assistance of one another; and as their\r\n      residence is not, like that of the farmer, necessarily tied down to a\r\n      precise spot, they naturally settle in the neighbourhood of one another,\r\n      and thus form a small town or village. The butcher, the brewer, and the\r\n      baker, soon join them, together with many other artificers and retailers,\r\n      necessary or useful for supplying their occasional wants, and who\r\n      contribute still further to augment the town. The inhabitants of the town,\r\n      and those of the country, are mutually the servants of one another. The\r\n      town is a continual fair or market, to which the inhabitants of the\r\n      country resort, in order to exchange their rude for manufactured produce.\r\n      It is this commerce which supplies the inhabitants of the town, both with\r\n      the materials of their work, and the means of their subsistence. The\r\n      quantity of the finished work which they sell to the inhabitants of the\r\n      country, necessarily regulates the quantity of the materials and\r\n      provisions which they buy. Neither their employment nor subsistence,\r\n      therefore, can augment, but in proportion to the augmentation of the\r\n      demand from the country for finished work; and this demand can augment\r\n      only in proportion to the extension of improvement and cultivation. Had\r\n      human institutions, therefore, never disturbed the natural course of\r\n      things, the progressive wealth and increase of the towns would, in every\r\n      political society, be consequential, and in proportion to the improvement\r\n      and cultivation of the territory of country.\r\n\r\n      In our North American colonies, where uncultivated land is still to be had\r\n      upon easy terms, no manufactures for distant sale have ever yet been\r\n      established in any of their towns. When an artificer has acquired a little\r\n      more stock than is necessary for carrying on his own business in supplying\r\n      the neighbouring country, he does not, in North America, attempt to\r\n      establish with it a manufacture for more distant sale, but employs it in\r\n      the purchase and improvement of uncultivated land. From artificer he\r\n      becomes planter; and neither the large wages nor the easy subsistence\r\n      which that country affords to artificers, can bribe him rather to work for\r\n      other people than for himself. He feels that an artificer is the servant\r\n      of his customers, from whom he derives his subsistence; but that a planter\r\n      who cultivates his own land, and derives his necessary subsistence from\r\n      the labour of his own family, is really a master, and independent of all\r\n      the world.\r\n\r\n      In countries, on the contrary, where there is either no uncultivated land,\r\n      or none that can be had upon easy terms, every artificer who has acquired\r\n      more stock than he can employ in the occasional jobs of the neighbourhood,\r\n      endeavours to prepare work for more distant sale. The smith erects some\r\n      sort of iron, the weaver some sort of linen or woollen manufactory. Those\r\n      different manufactures come, in process of time, to be gradually\r\n      subdivided, and thereby improved and refined in a great variety of ways,\r\n      which may easily be conceived, and which it is therefore unnecessary to\r\n      explain any farther.\r\n\r\n      In seeking for employment to a capital, manufactures are, upon equal or\r\n      nearly equal profits, naturally preferred to foreign commerce, for the\r\n      same reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures. As\r\n      the capital of the landlord or farmer is more secure than that of the\r\n      manufacturer, so the capital of the manufacturer, being at all times more\r\n      within his view and command, is more secure than that of the foreign\r\n      merchant. In every period, indeed, of every society, the surplus part both\r\n      of the rude and manufactured produce, or that for which there is no demand\r\n      at home, must be sent abroad, in order to be exchanged for something for\r\n      which there is some demand at home. But whether the capital which carries\r\n      this surplus produce abroad be a foreign or a domestic one, is of very\r\n      little importance. If the society has not acquired sufficient capital,\r\n      both to cultivate all its lands, and to manufacture in the completest\r\n      manner the whole of its rude produce, there is even a considerable\r\n      advantage that the rude produce should be exported by a foreign capital,\r\n      in order that the whole stock of the society may be employed in more\r\n      useful purposes. The wealth of ancient Egypt, that of China and Indostan,\r\n      sufficiently demonstrate that a nation may attain a very high degree of\r\n      opulence, though the greater part of its exportation trade be carried on\r\n      by foreigners. The progress of our North American and West Indian\r\n      colonies, would have been much less rapid, had no capital but what\r\n      belonged to themselves been employed in exporting their surplus produce.\r\n\r\n      According to the natural course of things, therefore, the greater part of\r\n      the capital of every growing society is, first, directed to agriculture,\r\n      afterwards to manufactures, and, last of all, to foreign commerce. This\r\n      order of things is so very natural, that in every society that had any\r\n      territory, it has always, I believe, been in some degree observed. Some of\r\n      their lands must have been cultivated before any considerable towns could\r\n      be established, and some sort of coarse industry of the manufacturing kind\r\n      must have been carried on in those towns, before they could well think of\r\n      employing themselves in foreign commerce.\r\n\r\n      But though this natural order of things must have taken place in some\r\n      degree in every such society, it has, in all the modern states of Europe,\r\n      been in many respects entirely inverted. The foreign commerce of some of\r\n      their cities has introduced all their finer manufactures, or such as were\r\n      fit for distant sale; and manufactures and foreign commerce together have\r\n      given birth to the principal improvements of agriculture. The manners and\r\n      customs which the nature of their original government introduced, and\r\n      which remained after that government was greatly altered, necessarily\r\n      forced them into this unnatural and retrograde order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nOF THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\nIN THE ANCIENT STATE OF EUROPE, AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      When the German and Scythian nations overran the western provinces of the\r\n      Roman empire, the confusions which followed so great a revolution lasted\r\n      for several centuries. The rapine and violence which the barbarians\r\n      exercised against the ancient inhabitants, interrupted the commerce\r\n      between the towns and the country. The towns were deserted, and the\r\n      country was left uncultivated; and the western provinces of Europe, which\r\n      had enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the Roman empire, sunk\r\n      into the lowest state of poverty and barbarism. During the continuance of\r\n      those confusions, the chiefs and principal leaders of those nations\r\n      acquired, or usurped to themselves, the greater part of the lands of those\r\n      countries. A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of them,\r\n      whether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a proprietor. All of\r\n      them were engrossed, and the greater part by a few great proprietors.\r\n\r\n      This original engrossing of uncultivated lands, though a great, might have\r\n      been but a transitory evil. They might soon have been divided again, and\r\n      broke into small parcels, either by succession or by alienation. The law\r\n      of primogeniture hindered them from being divided by succession; the\r\n      introduction of entails prevented their being broke into small parcels by\r\n      alienation.\r\n\r\n      When land, like moveables, is considered as the means only of subsistence\r\n      and enjoyment, the natural law of succession divides it, like them, among\r\n      all the children of the family; of all of whom the subsistence and\r\n      enjoyment may be supposed equally dear to the father. This natural law of\r\n      succession, accordingly, took place among the Romans who made no more\r\n      distinction between elder and younger, between male and female, in the\r\n      inheritance of lands, than we do in the distribution of moveables. But\r\n      when land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of\r\n      power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend\r\n      undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a\r\n      sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge,\r\n      and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He\r\n      made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his\r\n      neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed\r\n      estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those\r\n      who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it,\r\n      and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the\r\n      incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to\r\n      take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the\r\n      succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally\r\n      taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first\r\n      institution. That the power, and consequently the security of the\r\n      monarchy, may not be weakened by division, it must descend entire to one\r\n      of the children. To which of them so important a preference shall be\r\n      given, must be determined by some general rule, founded not upon the\r\n      doubtful distinctions of personal merit, but upon some plain and evident\r\n      difference which can admit of no dispute. Among the children of the same\r\n      family there can be no indisputable difference but that of sex, and that\r\n      of age. The male sex is universally preferred to the female; and when all\r\n      other things are equal, the elder everywhere takes place of the younger.\r\n      Hence the origin of the right of primogeniture, and of what is called\r\n      lineal succession.\r\n\r\n      Laws frequently continue in force long after the circumstances which first\r\n      gave occasion to them, and which could alone render them reasonable, are\r\n      no more. In the present state of Europe, the proprietor of a single acre\r\n      of land is as perfectly secure in his possession as the proprietor of\r\n      100,000. The right of primogeniture, however, still continues to be\r\n      respected; and as of all institutions it is the fittest to support the\r\n      pride of family distinctions, it is still likely to endure for many\r\n      centuries. In every other respect, nothing can be more contrary to the\r\n      real interest of a numerous family, than a right which, in order to enrich\r\n      one, beggars all the rest of the children.\r\n\r\n      Entails are the natural consequences of the law of primogeniture. They\r\n      were introduced to preserve a certain lineal succession, of which the law\r\n      of primogeniture first gave the idea, and to hinder any part of the\r\n      original estate from being carried out of the proposed line, either by\r\n      gift, or device, or alienation; either by the folly, or by the misfortune\r\n      of any of its successive owners. They were altogether unknown to the\r\n      Romans. Neither their substitutions, nor fidei commisses, bear any\r\n      resemblance to entails, though some French lawyers have thought proper to\r\n      dress the modern institution in the language and garb of those ancient\r\n      ones.\r\n\r\n      When great landed estates were a sort of principalities, entails might not\r\n      be unreasonable. Like what are called the fundamental laws of some\r\n      monarchies, they might frequently hinder the security of thousands from\r\n      being endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man. But in the\r\n      present state of Europe, when small as well as great estates derive their\r\n      security from the laws of their country, nothing can be more completely\r\n      absurd. They are founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions, the\r\n      supposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal\r\n      right to the earth, and to all that it possesses; but that the property of\r\n      the present generation should be restrained and regulated according to the\r\n      fancy of those who died, perhaps five hundred years ago. Entails, however,\r\n      are still respected, through the greater part of Europe; In those\r\n      countries, particularly, in which noble birth is a necessary qualification\r\n      for the enjoyment either of civil or military honours. Entails are thought\r\n      necessary for maintaining this exclusive privilege of the nobility to the\r\n      great offices and honours of their country; and that order having usurped\r\n      one unjust advantage over the rest of their fellow-citizens, lest their\r\n      poverty should render it ridiculous, it is thought reasonable that they\r\n      should have another. The common law of England, indeed, is said to abhor\r\n      perpetuities, and they are accordingly more restricted there than in any\r\n      other European monarchy; though even England is not altogether without\r\n      them. In Scotland, more than one fifth, perhaps more than one third part\r\n      of the whole lands in the country, are at present supposed to be under\r\n      strict entail.\r\n\r\n      Great tracts of uncultivated land were in this manner not only engrossed\r\n      by particular families, but the possibility of their being divided again\r\n      was as much as possible precluded for ever. It seldom happens, however,\r\n      that a great proprietor is a great improver. In the disorderly times which\r\n      gave birth to those barbarous institutions, the great proprietor was\r\n      sufficiently employed in defending his own territories, or in extending\r\n      his jurisdiction and authority over those of his neighbours. He had no\r\n      leisure to attend to the cultivation and improvement of land. When the\r\n      establishment of law and order afforded him this leisure, he often wanted\r\n      the inclination, and almost always the requisite abilities. If the expense\r\n      of his house and person either equalled or exceeded his revenue, as it did\r\n      very frequently, he had no stock to employ in this manner. If he was an\r\n      economist, he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual\r\n      savings in new purchases than in the improvement of his old estate. To\r\n      improve land with profit, like all other commercial projects, requires an\r\n      exact attention to small savings and small gains, of which a man born to a\r\n      great fortune, even though naturally frugal, is very seldom capable. The\r\n      situation of such a person naturally disposes him to attend rather to\r\n      ornament, which pleases his fancy, than to profit, for which he has so\r\n      little occasion. The elegance of his dress, of his equipage, of his house\r\n      and household furniture, are objects which, from his infancy, he has been\r\n      accustomed to have some anxiety about. The turn of mind which this habit\r\n      naturally forms, follows him when he comes to think of the improvement of\r\n      land. He embellishes, perhaps, four or five hundred acres in the\r\n      neighbourhood of his house, at ten times the expense which the land is\r\n      worth after all his improvements; and finds, that if he was to improve his\r\n      whole estate in the same manner, and he has little taste for any other, he\r\n      would be a bankrupt before he had finished the tenth part of it. There\r\n      still remain, in both parts of the united kingdom, some great estates\r\n      which have continued, without interruption, in the hands of the same\r\n      family since the times of feudal anarchy. Compare the present condition of\r\n      those estates with the possessions of the small proprietors in their\r\n      neighbourhood, and you will require no other argument to convince you how\r\n      unfavourable such extensive property is to improvement.\r\n\r\n      If little improvement was to be expected from such great proprietors,\r\n      still less was to be hoped for from those who occupied the land under\r\n      them. In the ancient state of Europe, the occupiers of land were all\r\n      tenants at will. They were all, or almost all, slaves, but their slavery\r\n      was of a milder kind than that known among the ancient Greeks and Romans,\r\n      or even in our West Indian colonies. They were supposed to belong more\r\n      directly to the land than to their master. They could, therefore, be sold\r\n      with it, but not separately. They could marry, provided it was with the\r\n      consent of their master; and he could not afterwards dissolve the marriage\r\n      by selling the man and wife to different persons. If he maimed or murdered\r\n      any of them, he was liable to some penalty, though generally but to a\r\n      small one. They were not, however, capable of acquiring property. Whatever\r\n      they acquired was acquired to their master, and he could take it from them\r\n      at pleasure. Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on by\r\n      means of such slaves, was properly carried on by their master. It was at\r\n      his expense. The seed, the cattle, and the instruments of husbandry, were\r\n      all his. It was for his benefit. Such slaves could acquire nothing but\r\n      their daily maintenance. It was properly the proprietor himself,\r\n      therefore, that in this case occupied his own lands, and cultivated them\r\n      by his own bondmen. This species of slavery still subsists in Russia,\r\n      Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and other parts of Germany. It is only\r\n      in the western and south-western provinces of Europe that it has gradually\r\n      been abolished altogether.\r\n\r\n      But if great improvements are seldom to be expected from great\r\n      proprietors, they are least of all to be expected when they employ slaves\r\n      for their workmen. The experience of all ages and nations, I believe,\r\n      demonstrates that the work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only\r\n      their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any. A person who can\r\n      acquire no property can have no other interest but to eat as much and to\r\n      labour as little as possible. Whatever work he does beyond what is\r\n      sufficient to purchase his own maintenance, can be squeezed out of him by\r\n      violence only, and not by any interest of his own. In ancient Italy, how\r\n      much the cultivation of corn degenerated, how unprofitable it became to\r\n      the master, when it fell under the management of slaves, is remarked both\r\n      by Pliny and Columella. In the time of Aristotle, it had not been much\r\n      better in ancient Greece. Speaking of the ideal republic described in the\r\n      laws of Plato, to maintain 5000 idle men (the number of warriors supposed\r\n      necessary for its defence), together with their women and servants, would\r\n      require, he says, a territory of boundless extent and fertility, like the\r\n      plains of Babylon.\r\n\r\n      The pride of man makes him love to domineer, and nothing mortifies him so\r\n      much as to be obliged to condescend to persuade his inferiors. Wherever\r\n      the law allows it, and the nature of the work can afford it, therefore, he\r\n      will generally prefer the service of slaves to that of freemen. The\r\n      planting of sugar and tobacco can afford the expense of slave cultivation.\r\n      The raising of corn, it seems, in the present times, cannot. In the\r\n      English colonies, of which the principal produce is corn, the far greater\r\n      part of the work is done by freemen. The late resolution of the Quakers in\r\n      Pennsylvania, to set at liberty all their negro slaves, may satisfy us\r\n      that their number cannot be very great. Had they made any considerable\r\n      part of their property, such a resolution could never have been agreed to.\r\n      In our sugar colonies., on the contrary, the whole work is done by slaves,\r\n      and in our tobacco colonies a very great part of it. The profits of a\r\n      sugar plantation in any of our West Indian colonies, are generally much\r\n      greater than those of any other cultivation that is known either in Europe\r\n      or America; and the profits of a tobacco plantation, though inferior to\r\n      those of sugar, are superior to those of corn, as has already been\r\n      observed. Both can afford the expense of slave cultivation but sugar can\r\n      afford it still better than tobacco. The number of negroes, accordingly,\r\n      is much greater, in proportion to that of whites, in our sugar than in our\r\n      tobacco colonies.\r\n\r\n      To the slave cultivators of ancient times gradually succeeded a species of\r\n      farmers, known at present in France by the name of metayers. They are\r\n      called in Latin Coloni Partiarii. They have been so long in disuse in\r\n      England, that at present I know no English name for them. The proprietor\r\n      furnished them with the seed, cattle, and instruments of husbandry, the\r\n      whole stock, in short, necessary for cultivating the farm. The produce was\r\n      divided equally between the proprietor and the farmer, after setting aside\r\n      what was judged necessary for keeping up the stock, which was restored to\r\n      the proprietor, when the farmer either quitted or was turned out of the\r\n      farm.\r\n\r\n      Land occupied by such tenants is properly cultivated at the expense of the\r\n      proprietors, as much as that occupied by slaves. There is, however, one\r\n      very essential difference between them. Such tenants, being freemen, are\r\n      capable of acquiring property; and having a certain proportion of the\r\n      produce of the land, they have a plain interest that the whole produce\r\n      should be as great as possible, in order that their own proportion may be\r\n      so. A slave, on the contrary, who can acquire nothing but his maintenance,\r\n      consults his own ease, by making the land produce as little as possible\r\n      over and above that maintenance. It is probable that it was partly upon\r\n      account of this advantage, and partly upon account of the encroachments\r\n      which the sovereigns, always jealous of the great lords, gradually\r\n      encouraged their villains to make upon their authority, and which seem, at\r\n      least, to have been such as rendered this species of servitude altogether\r\n      inconvenient, that tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the\r\n      greater part of Europe. The time and manner, however, in which so\r\n      important a revolution was brought about, is one of the most obscure\r\n      points in modern history. The church of Rome claims great merit in it; and\r\n      it is certain, that so early as the twelfth century, Alexander III.\r\n      published a bull for the general emancipation of slaves. It seems,\r\n      however, to have been rather a pious exhortation, than a law to which\r\n      exact obedience was required from the faithful. Slavery continued to take\r\n      place almost universally for several centuries afterwards, till it was\r\n      gradually abolished by the joint operation of the two interests above\r\n      mentioned; that of the proprietor on the one hand, and that of the\r\n      sovereign on the other. A villain, enfranchised, and at the same time\r\n      allowed to continue in possession of the land, having no stock of his own,\r\n      could cultivate it only by means of what the landlord advanced to him, and\r\n      must therefore have been what the French call a metayer.\r\n\r\n      It could never, however, be the interest even of this last species of\r\n      cultivators, to lay out, in the further improvement of the land, any part\r\n      of the little stock which they might save from their own share of the\r\n      produce; because the landlord, who laid out nothing, was to get one half\r\n      of whatever it produced. The tithe, which is but a tenth of the produce,\r\n      is found to be a very great hindrance to improvement. A tax, therefore,\r\n      which amounted to one half, must have been an effectual bar to it. It\r\n      might be the interest of a metayer to make the land produce as much as\r\n      could be brought out of it by means of the stock furnished by the\r\n      proprietor; but it could never be his interest to mix any part of his own\r\n      with it. In France, where five parts out of six of the whole kingdom are\r\n      said to be still occupied by this species of cultivators, the proprietors\r\n      complain, that their metayers take every opportunity of employing their\r\n      master’s cattle rather in carriage than in cultivation; because, in the\r\n      one case, they get the whole profits to themselves, in the other they\r\n      share them with their landlord. This species of tenants still subsists in\r\n      some parts of Scotland. They are called steel-bow tenants. Those ancient\r\n      English tenants, who are said by Chief-Baron Gilbert and Dr Blackstone to\r\n      have been rather bailiffs of the landlord than farmers, properly so\r\n      called, were probably of the same kind.\r\n\r\n      To this species of tenantry succeeded, though by very slow degrees,\r\n      farmers, properly so called, who cultivated the land with their own stock,\r\n      paying a rent certain to the landlord. When such farmers have a lease for\r\n      a term of years, they may sometimes find it for their interest to lay out\r\n      part of their capital in the further improvement of the farm; because they\r\n      may sometimes expect to recover it, with a large profit, before the\r\n      expiration of the lease. The possession, even of such farmers, however,\r\n      was long extremely precarious, and still is so in many parts of Europe.\r\n      They could, before the expiration of their term, be legally ousted of\r\n      their leases by a new purchaser; in England, even, by the fictitious\r\n      action of a common recovery. If they were turned out illegally by the\r\n      violence of their master, the action by which they obtained redress was\r\n      extremely imperfect. It did not always reinstate them in the possession of\r\n      the land, but gave them damages, which never amounted to a real loss. Even\r\n      in England, the country, perhaps of Europe, where the yeomanry has always\r\n      been most respected, it was not till about the 14th of Henry VII. that the\r\n      action of ejectment was invented, by which the tenant recovers, not\r\n      damages only, but possession, and in which his claim is not necessarily\r\n      concluded by the uncertain decision of a single assize. This action has\r\n      been found so effectual a remedy, that, in the modern practice, when the\r\n      landlord has occasion to sue for the possession of the land, he seldom\r\n      makes use of the actions which properly belong to him as a landlord, the\r\n      writ of right or the writ of entry, but sues in the name of his tenant, by\r\n      the writ of ejectment. In England, therefore the security of the tenant is\r\n      equal to that of the proprietor. In England, besides, a lease for life of\r\n      forty shillings a-year value is a freehold, and entitles the lessee to a\r\n      vote for a member of parliament; and as a great part of the yeomanry have\r\n      freeholds of this kind, the whole order becomes respectable to their\r\n      landlords, on account of the political consideration which this gives\r\n      them. There is, I believe, nowhere in Europe, except in England, any\r\n      instance of the tenant building upon the land of which he had no lease,\r\n      and trusting that the honour of his landlord would take no advantage of so\r\n      important an improvement. Those laws and customs, so favourable to the\r\n      yeomanry, have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of\r\n      England, than all their boasted regulations of commerce taken together.\r\n\r\n      The law which secures the longest leases against successors of every kind,\r\n      is, so far as I know, peculiar to Great Britain. It was introduced into\r\n      Scotland so early as 1449, by a law of James II. Its beneficial influence,\r\n      however, has been much obstructed by entails; the heirs of entail being\r\n      generally restrained from letting leases for any long term of years,\r\n      frequently for more than one year. A late act of parliament has, in this\r\n      respect, somewhat slackened their fetters, though they are still by much\r\n      too strait. In Scotland, besides, as no leasehold gives a vote for a\r\n      member of parliament, the yeomanry are upon this account less respectable\r\n      to their landlords than in England.\r\n\r\n      In other parts of Europe, after it was found convenient to secure tenants\r\n      both against heirs and purchasers, the term of their security was still\r\n      limited to a very short period; in France, for example, to nine years from\r\n      the commencement of the lease. It has in that country, indeed, been lately\r\n      extended to twentyseven, a period still too short to encourage the tenant\r\n      to make the most important improvements. The proprietors of land were\r\n      anciently the legislators of every part of Europe. The laws relating to\r\n      land, therefore, were all calculated for what they supposed the interest\r\n      of the proprietor. It was for his interest, they had imagined, that no\r\n      lease granted by any of his predecessors should hinder him from enjoying,\r\n      during a long term of years, the full value of his land. Avarice and\r\n      injustice are always short-sighted, and they did not foresee how much this\r\n      regulation must obstruct improvement, and thereby hurt, in the long-run,\r\n      the real interest of the landlord.\r\n\r\n      The farmers, too, besides paying the rent, were anciently, it was\r\n      supposed, bound to perform a great number of services to the landlord,\r\n      which were seldom either specified in the lease, or regulated by any\r\n      precise rule, but by the use and wont of the manor or barony. These\r\n      services, therefore, being almost entirely arbitrary, subjected the tenant\r\n      to many vexations. In Scotland the abolition of all services not precisely\r\n      stipulated in the lease, has, in the course of a few years, very much\r\n      altered for the better the condition of the yeomanry of that country.\r\n\r\n      The public services to which the yeomanry were bound, were not less\r\n      arbitrary than the private ones. To make and maintain the high roads, a\r\n      servitude which still subsists, I believe, everywhere, though with\r\n      different degrees of oppression in different countries, was not the only\r\n      one. When the king’s troops, when his household, or his officers of any\r\n      kind, passed through any part of the country, the yeomanry were bound to\r\n      provide them with horses, carriages, and provisions, at a price regulated\r\n      by the purveyor. Great Britain is, I believe, the only monarchy in Europe\r\n      where the oppression of purveyance has been entirely abolished. It still\r\n      subsists in France and Germany.\r\n\r\n      The public taxes, to which they were subject, were as irregular and\r\n      oppressive as the services. The ancient lords, though extremely unwilling\r\n      to grant, themselves, any pecuniary aid to their sovereign, easily allowed\r\n      him to tallage, as they called it, their tenants, and had not knowledge\r\n      enough to foresee how much this must, in the end, affect their own\r\n      revenue. The taille, as it still subsists in France may serve as an\r\n      example of those ancient tallages. It is a tax upon the supposed profits\r\n      of the farmer, which they estimate by the stock that he has upon the farm.\r\n      It is his interest, therefore, to appear to have as little as possible,\r\n      and consequently to employ as little as possible in its cultivation, and\r\n      none in its improvement. Should any stock happen to accumulate in the\r\n      hands of a French farmer, the taille is almost equal to a prohibition of\r\n      its ever being employed upon the land. This tax, besides, is supposed to\r\n      dishonour whoever is subject to it, and to degrade him below, not only the\r\n      rank of a gentleman, but that of a burgher; and whoever rents the lands of\r\n      another becomes subject to it. No gentleman, nor even any burgher, who has\r\n      stock, will submit to this degradation. This tax, therefore, not only\r\n      hinders the stock which accumulates upon the land from being employed in\r\n      its improvement, but drives away all other stock from it. The ancient\r\n      tenths and fifteenths, so usual in England in former times, seem, so far\r\n      as they affected the land, to have been taxes of the same nature with the\r\n      taille.\r\n\r\n      Under all these discouragements, little improvement could be expected from\r\n      the occupiers of land. That order of people, with all the liberty and\r\n      security which law can give, must always improve under great disadvantage.\r\n      The farmer, compared with the proprietor, is as a merchant who trades with\r\n      burrowed money, compared with one who trades with his own. The stock of\r\n      both may improve; but that of the one, with only equal good conduct, must\r\n      always improve more slowly than that of the other, on account of the large\r\n      share of the profits which is consumed by the interest of the loan. The\r\n      lands cultivated by the farmer must, in the same manner, with only equal\r\n      good conduct, be improved more slowly than those cultivated by the\r\n      proprietor, on account of the large share of the produce which is consumed\r\n      in the rent, and which, had the farmer been proprietor, he might have\r\n      employed in the further improvement of the land. The station of a farmer,\r\n      besides, is, from the nature of things, inferior to that of a proprietor.\r\n      Through the greater part of Europe, the yeomanry are regarded as an\r\n      inferior rank of people, even to the better sort of tradesmen and\r\n      mechanics, and in all parts of Europe to the great merchants and master\r\n      manufacturers. It can seldom happen, therefore, that a man of any\r\n      considerable stock should quit the superior, in order to place himself in\r\n      an inferior station. Even in the present state of Europe, therefore,\r\n      little stock is likely to go from any other profession to the improvement\r\n      of land in the way of farming. More does, perhaps, in Great Britain than\r\n      in any other country, though even there the great stocks which are in some\r\n      places employed in farming, have generally been acquired by fanning, the\r\n      trade, perhaps, in which, of all others, stock is commonly acquired most\r\n      slowly. After small proprietors, however, rich and great farmers are in\r\n      every country the principal improvers. There are more such, perhaps, in\r\n      England than in any other European monarchy. In the republican governments\r\n      of Holland, and of Berne in Switzerland, the farmers are said to be not\r\n      inferior to those of England.\r\n\r\n      The ancient policy of Europe was, over and above all this, unfavourable to\r\n      the improvement and cultivation of land, whether carried on by the\r\n      proprietor or by the farmer; first, by the general prohibition of the\r\n      exportation of corn, without a special licence, which seems to have been a\r\n      very universal regulation; and, secondly, by the restraints which were\r\n      laid upon the inland commerce, not only of corn, but of almost every other\r\n      part of the produce of the farm, by the absurd laws against engrossers,\r\n      regraters, and forestallers, and by the privileges of fairs and markets.\r\n      It has already been observed in what manner the prohibition of the\r\n      exportation of corn, together with some encouragement given to the\r\n      importation of foreign corn, obstructed the cultivation of ancient Italy,\r\n      naturally the most fertile country in Europe, and at that time the seat of\r\n      the greatest empire in the world. To what degree such restraints upon the\r\n      inland commerce of this commodity, joined to the general prohibition of\r\n      exportation, must have discouraged the cultivation of countries less\r\n      fertile, and less favourably circumstanced, it is not, perhaps, very easy\r\n      to imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF CITIES\r\nAND TOWNS, AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The inhabitants of cities and towns were, after the fall of the Roman\r\n      empire, not more favoured than those of the country. They consisted,\r\n      indeed, of a very different order of people from the first inhabitants of\r\n      the ancient republics of Greece and Italy. These last were composed\r\n      chiefly of the proprietors of lands, among whom the public territory was\r\n      originally divided, and who found it convenient to build their houses in\r\n      the neighbourhood of one another, and to surround them with a wall, for\r\n      the sake of common defence. After the fall of the Roman empire, on the\r\n      contrary, the proprietors of land seem generally to have lived in\r\n      fortified castles on their own estates, and in the midst of their own\r\n      tenants and dependants. The towns were chiefly inhabited by tradesmen and\r\n      mechanics, who seem, in those days, to have been of servile, or very\r\n      nearly of servile condition. The privileges which we find granted by\r\n      ancient charters to the inhabitants of some of the principal towns in\r\n      Europe, sufficiently show what they were before those grants. The people\r\n      to whom it is granted as a privilege, that they might give away their own\r\n      daughters in marriage without the consent of their lord, that upon their\r\n      death their own children, and not their lord, should succeed to their\r\n      goods, and that they might dispose of their own effects by will, must,\r\n      before those grants, have been either altogether, or very nearly, in the\r\n      same state of villanage with the occupiers of land in the country.\r\n\r\n      They seem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean set of people, who\r\n      seemed to travel about with their goods from place to place, and from fair\r\n      to fair, like the hawkers and pedlars of the present times. In all the\r\n      different countries of Europe then, in the same manner as in several of\r\n      the Tartar governments of Asia at present, taxes used to be levied upon\r\n      the persons and goods of travellers, when they passed through certain\r\n      manors, when they went over certain bridges, when they carried about their\r\n      goods from place to place in a fair, when they erected in it a booth or\r\n      stall to sell them in. These different taxes were known in England by the\r\n      names of passage, pontage, lastage, and stallage. Sometimes the king,\r\n      sometimes a great lord, who had, it seems, upon some occasions, authority\r\n      to do this, would grant to particular traders, to such particularly as\r\n      lived in their own demesnes, a general exemption from such taxes. Such\r\n      traders, though in other respects of servile, or very nearly of servile\r\n      condition, were upon this account called free traders. They, in return,\r\n      usually paid to their protector a sort of annual poll-tax. In those days\r\n      protection was seldom granted without a valuable consideration, and this\r\n      tax might perhaps be considered as compensation for what their patrons\r\n      might lose by their exemption from other taxes. At first, both those\r\n      poll-taxes and those exemptions seem to have been altogether personal, and\r\n      to have affected only particular individuals, during either their lives,\r\n      or the pleasure of their protectors. In the very imperfect accounts which\r\n      have been published from Doomsday-book, of several of the towns of\r\n      England, mention is frequently made, sometimes of the tax which particular\r\n      burghers paid, each of them, either to the king, or to some other great\r\n      lord, for this sort of protection, and sometimes of the general amount\r\n      only of all those taxes. {see Brady’s Historical Treatise of Cities and\r\n      Boroughs, p. 3. etc.}\r\n\r\n      But how servile soever may have been originally the condition of the\r\n      inhabitants of the towns, it appears evidently, that they arrived at\r\n      liberty and independency much earlier than the occupiers of land in the\r\n      country. That part of the king’s revenue which arose from such poll-taxes\r\n      in any particular town, used commonly to be let in farm, during a term of\r\n      years, for a rent certain, sometimes to the sheriff of the county, and\r\n      sometimes to other persons. The burghers themselves frequently got credit\r\n      enough to be admitted to farm the revenues of this sort which arose out of\r\n      their own town, they becoming jointly and severally answerable for the\r\n      whole rent. {See Madox, Firma Burgi, p. 18; also History of the Exchequer,\r\n      chap. 10, sect. v, p. 223, first edition.} To let a farm in this manner,\r\n      was quite agreeable to the usual economy of, I believe, the sovereigns of\r\n      all the different countries of Europe, who used frequently to let whole\r\n      manors to all the tenants of those manors, they becoming jointly and\r\n      severally answerable for the whole rent; but in return being allowed to\r\n      collect it in their own way, and to pay it into the king’s exchequer by\r\n      the hands of their own bailiff, and being thus altogether freed from the\r\n      insolence of the king’s officers; a circumstance in those days regarded as\r\n      of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n      At first, the farm of the town was probably let to the burghers, in the\r\n      same manner as it had been to other farmers, for a term of years only. In\r\n      process of time, however, it seems to have become the general practice to\r\n      grant it to them in fee, that is for ever, reserving a rent certain, never\r\n      afterwards to be augmented. The payment having thus become perpetual, the\r\n      exemptions, in return, for which it was made, naturally became perpetual\r\n      too. Those exemptions, therefore, ceased to be personal, and could not\r\n      afterwards be considered as belonging to individuals, as individuals, but\r\n      as burghers of a particular burgh, which, upon this account, was called a\r\n      free burgh, for the same reason that they had been called free burghers or\r\n      free traders.\r\n\r\n      Along with this grant, the important privileges, above mentioned, that\r\n      they might give away their own daughters in marriage, that their children\r\n      should succeed to them, and that they might dispose of their own effects\r\n      by will, were generally bestowed upon the burghers of the town to whom it\r\n      was given. Whether such privileges had before been usually granted, along\r\n      with the freedom of trade, to particular burghers, as individuals, I know\r\n      not. I reckon it not improbable that they were, though I cannot produce\r\n      any direct evidence of it. But however this may have been, the principal\r\n      attributes of villanage and slavery being thus taken away from them, they\r\n      now at least became really free, in our present sense of the word freedom.\r\n\r\n      Nor was this all. They were generally at the same time erected into a\r\n      commonalty or corporation, with the privilege of having magistrates and a\r\n      town-council of their own, of making bye-laws for their own government, of\r\n      building walls for their own defence, and of reducing all their\r\n      inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, by obliging them to watch\r\n      and ward; that is, as anciently understood, to guard and defend those\r\n      walls against all attacks and surprises, by night as well as by day. In\r\n      England they were generally exempted from suit to the hundred and county\r\n      courts: and all such pleas as should arise among them, the pleas of the\r\n      crown excepted, were left to the decision of their own magistrates. In\r\n      other countries, much greater and more extensive jurisdictions were\r\n      frequently granted to them. {See Madox, Firma Burgi. See also Pfeffel in\r\n      the Remarkable events under Frederick II. and his Successors of the House\r\n      of Suabia.}\r\n\r\n      It might, probably, be necessary to grant to such towns as were admitted\r\n      to farm their own revenues, some sort of compulsive jurisdiction to oblige\r\n      their own citizens to make payment. In those disorderly times, it might\r\n      have been extremely inconvenient to have left them to seek this sort of\r\n      justice from any other tribunal. But it must seem extraordinary, that the\r\n      sovereigns of all the different countries of Europe should have exchanged\r\n      in this manner for a rent certain, never more to be augmented, that branch\r\n      of their revenue, which was, perhaps, of all others, the most likely to be\r\n      improved by the natural course of things, without either expense or\r\n      attention of their own; and that they should, besides, have in this manner\r\n      voluntarily erected a sort of independent republics in the heart of their\r\n      own dominions.\r\n\r\n      In order to understand this, it must be remembered, that, in those days,\r\n      the sovereign of perhaps no country in Europe was able to protect, through\r\n      the whole extent of his dominions, the weaker part of his subjects from\r\n      the oppression of the great lords. Those whom the law could not protect,\r\n      and who were not strong enough to defend themselves, were obliged either\r\n      to have recourse to the protection of some great lord, and in order to\r\n      obtain it, to become either his slaves or vassals; or to enter into a\r\n      league of mutual defence for the common protection of one another. The\r\n      inhabitants of cities and burghs, considered as single individuals, had no\r\n      power to defend themselves; but by entering into a league of mutual\r\n      defence with their neighbours, they were capable of making no contemptible\r\n      resistance. The lords despised the burghers, whom they considered not only\r\n      as a different order, but as a parcel of emancipated slaves, almost of a\r\n      different species from themselves. The wealth of the burghers never failed\r\n      to provoke their envy and indignation, and they plundered them upon every\r\n      occasion without mercy or remorse. The burghers naturally hated and feared\r\n      the lords. The king hated and feared them too; but though, perhaps, he\r\n      might despise, he had no reason either to hate or fear the burghers.\r\n      Mutual interest, therefore, disposed them to support the king, and the\r\n      king to support them against the lords. They were the enemies of his\r\n      enemies, and it was his interest to render them as secure and independent\r\n      of those enemies as he could. By granting them magistrates of their own,\r\n      the privilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of\r\n      building walls for their own defence, and that of reducing all their\r\n      inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, he gave them all the\r\n      means of security and independency of the barons which it was in his power\r\n      to bestow. Without the establishment of some regular government of this\r\n      kind, without some authority to compel their inhabitants to act according\r\n      to some certain plan or system, no voluntary league of mutual defence\r\n      could either have afforded them any permanent security, or have enabled\r\n      them to give the king any considerable support. By granting them the farm\r\n      of their own town in fee, he took away from those whom he wished to have\r\n      for his friends, and, if one may say so, for his allies, all ground of\r\n      jealousy and suspicion, that he was ever afterwards to oppress them,\r\n      either by raising the farm-rent of their town, or by granting it to some\r\n      other farmer.\r\n\r\n      The princes who lived upon the worst terms with their barons, seem\r\n      accordingly to have been the most liberal in grants of this kind to their\r\n      burghs. King John of England, for example, appears to have been a most\r\n      munificent benefactor to his towns. {See Madox.} Philip I. of France lost\r\n      all authority over his barons. Towards the end of his reign, his son\r\n      Lewis, known afterwards by the name of Lewis the Fat, consulted, according\r\n      to Father Daniel, with the bishops of the royal demesnes, concerning the\r\n      most proper means of restraining the violence of the great lords. Their\r\n      advice consisted of two different proposals. One was to erect a new order\r\n      of jurisdiction, by establishing magistrates and a town-council in every\r\n      considerable town of his demesnes. The other was to form a new militia, by\r\n      making the inhabitants of those towns, under the command of their own\r\n      magistrates, march out upon proper occasions to the assistance of the\r\n      king. It is from this period, according to the French antiquarians, that\r\n      we are to date the institution of the magistrates and councils of cities\r\n      in France. It was during the unprosperous reigns of the princes of the\r\n      house of Suabia, that the greater part of the free towns of Germany\r\n      received the first grants of their privileges, and that the famous\r\n      Hanseatic league first became formidable. {See Pfeffel.}\r\n\r\n      The militia of the cities seems, in those times, not to have been inferior\r\n      to that of the country; and as they could be more readily assembled upon\r\n      any sudden occasion, they frequently had the advantage in their disputes\r\n      with the neighbouring lords. In countries such as Italy or Switzerland, in\r\n      which, on account either of their distance from the principal seat of\r\n      government, of the natural strength of the country itself, or of some\r\n      other reason, the sovereign came to lose the whole of his authority; the\r\n      cities generally became independent republics, and conquered all the\r\n      nobility in their neighbourhood; obliging them to pull down their castles\r\n      in the country, and to live, like other peaceable inhabitants, in the\r\n      city. This is the short history of the republic of Berne, as well as of\r\n      several other cities in Switzerland. If you except Venice, for of that\r\n      city the history is somewhat different, it is the history of all the\r\n      considerable Italian republics, of which so great a number arose and\r\n      perished between the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the sixteenth\r\n      century.\r\n\r\n      In countries such as France and England, where the authority of the\r\n      sovereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether, the\r\n      cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent. They became,\r\n      however, so considerable, that the sovereign could impose no tax upon\r\n      them, besides the stated farm-rent of the town, without their own consent.\r\n      They were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the general assembly\r\n      of the states of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and\r\n      the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some extraordinary aid to\r\n      the king. Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their\r\n      deputies seem sometimes to have been employed by him as a counterbalance\r\n      in those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin\r\n      of the representation of burghs in the states-general of all great\r\n      monarchies in Europe.\r\n\r\n      Order and good government, and along with them the liberty and security of\r\n      individuals, were in this manner established in cities, at a time when the\r\n      occupiers of land in the country, were exposed to every sort of violence.\r\n      But men in this defenceless state naturally content themselves with their\r\n      necessary subsistence; because, to acquire more, might only tempt the\r\n      injustice of their oppressors. On the contrary, when they are secure of\r\n      enjoying the fruits of their industry, they naturally exert it to better\r\n      their condition, and to acquire not only the necessaries, but the\r\n      conveniencies and elegancies of life. That industry, therefore, which aims\r\n      at something more than necessary subsistence, was established in cities\r\n      long before it was commonly practised by the occupiers of land in the\r\n      country. If, in the hands of a poor cultivator, oppressed with the\r\n      servitude of villanage, some little stock should accumulate, he would\r\n      naturally conceal it with great care from his master, to whom it would\r\n      otherwise have belonged, and take the first opportunity of running away to\r\n      a town. The law was at that time so indulgent to the inhabitants of towns,\r\n      and so desirous of diminishing the authority of the lords over those of\r\n      the country, that if he could conceal himself there from the pursuit of\r\n      his lord for a year, he was free for ever. Whatever stock, therefore,\r\n      accumulated in the hands of the industrious part of the inhabitants of the\r\n      country, naturally took refuge in cities, as the only sanctuaries in which\r\n      it could be secure to the person that acquired it.\r\n\r\n      The inhabitants of a city, it is true, must always ultimately derive their\r\n      subsistence, and the whole materials and means of their industry, from the\r\n      country. But those of a city, situated near either the sea-coast or the\r\n      banks of a navigable river, are not necessarily confined to derive them\r\n      from the country in their neighbourhood. They have a much wider range, and\r\n      may draw them from the most remote corners of the world, either in\r\n      exchange for the manufactured produce of their own industry, or by\r\n      performing the office of carriers between distant countries, and\r\n      exchanging the produce of one for that of another. A city might, in this\r\n      manner, grow up to great wealth and splendour, while not only the country\r\n      in its neighbourhood, but all those to which it traded, were in poverty\r\n      and wretchedness. Each of those countries, perhaps, taken singly, could\r\n      afford it but a small part, either of its subsistence or of its\r\n      employment; but all of them taken together, could afford it both a great\r\n      subsistence and a great employment. There were, however, within the narrow\r\n      circle of the commerce of those times, some countries that were opulent\r\n      and industrious. Such was the Greek empire as long as it subsisted, and\r\n      that of the Saracens during the reigns of the Abassides. Such, too, was\r\n      Egypt till it was conquered by the Turks, some part of the coast of\r\n      Barbary, and all those provinces of Spain which were under the government\r\n      of the Moors.\r\n\r\n      The cities of Italy seem to have been the first in Europe which were\r\n      raised by commerce to any considerable degree of opulence. Italy lay in\r\n      the centre of what was at that time the improved and civilized part of the\r\n      world. The crusades, too, though, by the great waste of stock and\r\n      destruction of inhabitants which they occasioned, they must necessarily\r\n      have retarded the progress of the greater part of Europe, were extremely\r\n      favourable to that of some Italian cities. The great armies which marched\r\n      from all parts to the conquest of the Holy Land, gave extraordinary\r\n      encouragement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, sometimes in\r\n      transporting them thither, and always in supplying them with provisions.\r\n      They were the commissaries, if one may say so, of those armies; and the\r\n      most destructive frenzy that ever befel the European nations, was a source\r\n      of opulence to those republics.\r\n\r\n      The inhabitants of trading cities, by importing the improved manufactures\r\n      and expensive luxuries of richer countries, afforded some food to the\r\n      vanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly purchased them with great\r\n      quantities of the rude produce of their own lands. The commerce of a great\r\n      part of Europe in those times, accordingly, consisted chiefly in the\r\n      exchange of their own rude, for the manufactured produce of more civilized\r\n      nations. Thus the wool of England used to be exchanged for the wines of\r\n      France, and the fine cloths of Flanders, in the same manner as the corn in\r\n      Poland is at this day, exchanged for the wines and brandies of France, and\r\n      for the silks and velvets of France and Italy.\r\n\r\n      A taste for the finer and more improved manufactures was, in this manner,\r\n      introduced by foreign commerce into countries where no such works were\r\n      carried on. But when this taste became so general as to occasion a\r\n      considerable demand, the merchants, in order to save the expense of\r\n      carriage, naturally endeavoured to establish some manufactures of the same\r\n      kind in their own country. Hence the origin of the first manufactures for\r\n      distant sale, that seem to have been established in the western provinces\r\n      of Europe, after the fall of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n      No large country, it must be observed, ever did or could subsist without\r\n      some sort of manufactures being carried on in it; and when it is said of\r\n      any such country that it has no manufactures, it must always be understood\r\n      of the finer and more improved, or of such as are fit for distant sale. In\r\n      every large country both the clothing and household furniture or the far\r\n      greater part of the people, are the produce of their own industry. This is\r\n      even more universally the case in those poor countries which are commonly\r\n      said to have no manufactures, than in those rich ones that are said to\r\n      abound in them. In the latter you will generally find, both in the clothes\r\n      and household furniture of the lowest rank of people, a much greater\r\n      proportion of foreign productions than in the former.\r\n\r\n      Those manufactures which are fit for distant sale, seem to have been\r\n      introduced into different countries in two different ways.\r\n\r\n      Sometimes they have been introduced in the manner above mentioned, by the\r\n      violent operation, if one may say so, of the stocks of particular\r\n      merchants and undertakers, who established them in imitation of some\r\n      foreign manufactures of the same kind. Such manufactures, therefore, are\r\n      the offspring of foreign commerce; and such seem to have been the ancient\r\n      manufactures of silks, velvets, and brocades, which flourished in Lucca\r\n      during the thirteenth century. They were banished from thence by the\r\n      tyranny of one of Machiavel’s heroes, Castruccio Castracani. In 1310, nine\r\n      hundred families were driven out of Lucca, of whom thirty-one retired to\r\n      Venice, and offered to introduce there the silk manufacture. {See Sandi\r\n      Istoria civile de Vinezia, part 2 vol. i, page 247 and 256.} Their offer\r\n      was accepted, many privileges were conferred upon them, and they began the\r\n      manufacture with three hundred workmen. Such, too, seem to have been the\r\n      manufactures of fine cloths that anciently flourished in Flanders, and\r\n      which were introduced into England in the beginning of the reign of\r\n      Elizabeth, and such are the present silk manufactures of Lyons and\r\n      Spitalfields. Manufactures introduced in this manner are generally\r\n      employed upon foreign materials, being imitations of foreign manufactures.\r\n      When the Venetian manufacture was first established, the materials were\r\n      all brought from Sicily and the Levant. The more ancient manufacture of\r\n      Lucca was likewise carried on with foreign materials. The cultivation of\r\n      mulberry trees, and the breeding of silk-worms, seem not to have been\r\n      common in the northern parts of Italy before the sixteenth century. Those\r\n      arts were not introduced into France till the reign of Charles IX. The\r\n      manufactures of Flanders were carried on chiefly with Spanish and English\r\n      wool. Spanish wool was the material, not of the first woollen manufacture\r\n      of England, but of the first that was fit for distant sale. More than one\r\n      half the materials of the Lyons manufacture is at this day foreign silk;\r\n      when it was first established, the whole, or very nearly the whole, was\r\n      so. No part of the materials of the Spitalfields manufacture is ever\r\n      likely to be the produce of England. The seat of such manufactures, as\r\n      they are generally introduced by the scheme and project of a few\r\n      individuals, is sometimes established in a maritime city, and sometimes in\r\n      an inland town, according as their interest, judgment, or caprice, happen\r\n      to determine.\r\n\r\n      At other times, manufactures for distant sale grow up naturally, and as it\r\n      were of their own accord, by the gradual refinement of those household and\r\n      coarser manufactures which must at all times be carried on even in the\r\n      poorest and rudest countries. Such manufactures are generally employed\r\n      upon the materials which the country produces, and they seem frequently to\r\n      have been first refined and improved in such inland countries as were not,\r\n      indeed, at a very great, but at a considerable distance from the\r\n      sea-coast, and sometimes even from all water carriage. An inland country,\r\n      naturally fertile and easily cultivated, produces a great surplus of\r\n      provisions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the cultivators; and\r\n      on account of the expense of land carriage, and inconveniency of river\r\n      navigation, it may frequently be difficult to send this surplus abroad.\r\n      Abundance, therefore, renders provisions cheap, and encourages a great\r\n      number of workmen to settle in the neighbourhood, who find that their\r\n      industry can there procure them more of the necessaries and conveniencies\r\n      of life than in other places. They work up the materials of manufacture\r\n      which the land produces, and exchange their finished work, or, what is the\r\n      same thing, the price of it, for more materials and provisions. They give\r\n      a new value to the surplus part of the rude produce, by saving the expense\r\n      of carrying it to the water-side, or to some distant market; and they\r\n      furnish the cultivators with something in exchange for it that is either\r\n      useful or agreeable to them, upon easier terms than they could have\r\n      obtained it before. The cultivators get a better price for their surplus\r\n      produce, and can purchase cheaper other conveniencies which they have\r\n      occasion for. They are thus both encouraged and enabled to increase this\r\n      surplus produce by a further improvement and better cultivation of the\r\n      land; and as the fertility of the land had given birth to the manufacture,\r\n      so the progress of the manufacture re-acts upon the land, and increases\r\n      still further its fertility. The manufacturers first supply the\r\n      neighbourhood, and afterwards, as their work improves and refines, more\r\n      distant markets. For though neither the rude produce, nor even the coarse\r\n      manufacture, could, without the greatest difficulty, support the expense\r\n      of a considerable land-carriage, the refined and improved manufacture\r\n      easily may. In a small bulk it frequently contains the price of a great\r\n      quantity of rude produce. A piece of fine cloth, for example which weighs\r\n      only eighty pounds, contains in it the price, not only of eighty pounds\r\n      weight of wool, but sometimes of several thousand weight of corn, the\r\n      maintenance of the different working people, and of their immediate\r\n      employers. The corn which could with difficulty have been carried abroad\r\n      in its own shape, is in this manner virtually exported in that of the\r\n      complete manufacture, and may easily be sent to the remotest corners of\r\n      the world. In this manner have grown up naturally, and, as it were, of\r\n      their own accord, the manufactures of Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield,\r\n      Birmingham, and Wolverhampton. Such manufactures are the offspring of\r\n      agriculture. In the modern history of Europe, their extension and\r\n      improvement have generally been posterior to those which were the\r\n      offspring of foreign commerce. England was noted for the manufacture of\r\n      fine cloths made of Spanish wool, more than a century before any of those\r\n      which now flourish in the places above mentioned were fit for foreign\r\n      sale. The extension and improvement of these last could not take place but\r\n      in consequence of the extension and improvement of agriculture, the last\r\n      and greatest effect of foreign commerce, and of the manufactures\r\n      immediately introduced by it, and which I shall now proceed to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nHOW THE COMMERCE OF TOWNS CONTRIBUTED\r\nTO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The increase and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns contributed\r\n      to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they\r\n      belonged, in three different ways.\r\n\r\n      First, by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the\r\n      country, they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further\r\n      improvement. This benefit was not even confined to the countries in which\r\n      they were situated, but extended more or less to all those with which they\r\n      had any dealings. To all of them they afforded a market for some part\r\n      either of their rude or manufactured produce, and, consequently, gave some\r\n      encouragement to the industry and improvement of all. Their own country,\r\n      however, on account of its neighbourhood, necessarily derived the greatest\r\n      benefit from this market. Its rude produce being charged with less\r\n      carriage, the traders could pay the growers a better price for it, and yet\r\n      afford it as cheap to the consumers as that of more distant countries.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was frequently\r\n      employed in purchasing such lands as were to be sold, of which a great\r\n      part would frequently be uncultivated. Merchants are commonly ambitious of\r\n      becoming country gentlemen, and, when they do, they are generally the best\r\n      of all improvers. A merchant is accustomed to employ his money chiefly in\r\n      profitable projects; whereas a mere country gentleman is accustomed to\r\n      employ it chiefly in expense. The one often sees his money go from him,\r\n      and return to him again with a profit; the other, when once he parts with\r\n      it, very seldom expects to see any more of it. Those different habits\r\n      naturally affect their temper and disposition in every sort of business.\r\n      The merchant is commonly a bold, a country gentleman a timid undertaker.\r\n      The one is not afraid to lay out at once a large capital upon the\r\n      improvement of his land, when he has a probable prospect of raising the\r\n      value of it in proportion to the expense; the other, if he has any\r\n      capital, which is not always the case, seldom ventures to employ it in\r\n      this manner. If he improves at all, it is commonly not with a capital, but\r\n      with what he can save out or his annual revenue. Whoever has had the\r\n      fortune to live in a mercantile town, situated in an unimproved country,\r\n      must have frequently observed how much more spirited the operations of\r\n      merchants were in this way, than those of mere country gentlemen. The\r\n      habits, besides, of order, economy, and attention, to which mercantile\r\n      business naturally forms a merchant, render him much fitter to execute,\r\n      with profit and success, any project of improvement.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, and lastly, commerce and manufactures gradually introduced order\r\n      and good government, and with them the liberty and security of\r\n      individuals, among the inhabitants of the country, who had before lived\r\n      almost in a continual state of war with their neighbours, and of servile\r\n      dependency upon their superiors. This, though it has been the least\r\n      observed, is by far the most important of all their effects. Mr Hume is\r\n      the only writer who, so far as I know, has hitherto taken notice of it.\r\n\r\n      In a country which has neither foreign commerce nor any of the finer\r\n      manufactures, a great proprietor, having nothing for which he can exchange\r\n      the greater part of the produce of his lands which is over and above the\r\n      maintenance of the cultivators, consumes the whole in rustic hospitality\r\n      at home. If this surplus produce is sufficient to maintain a hundred or a\r\n      thousand men, he can make use of it in no other way than by maintaining a\r\n      hundred or a thousand men. He is at all times, therefore, surrounded with\r\n      a multitude of retainers and dependants, who, having no equivalent to give\r\n      in return for their maintenance, but being fed entirely by his bounty,\r\n      must obey him, for the same reason that soldiers must obey the prince who\r\n      pays them. Before the extension of commerce and manufactures in Europe,\r\n      the hospitality of the rich and the great, from the sovereign down to the\r\n      smallest baron, exceeded every thing which, in the present times, we can\r\n      easily form a notion of Westminster-hall was the dining-room of William\r\n      Rufus, and might frequently, perhaps, not be too large for his company. It\r\n      was reckoned a piece of magnificence in Thomas Becket, that he strewed the\r\n      floor of his hall with clean hay or rushes in the season, in order that\r\n      the knights and squires, who could not get seats, might not spoil their\r\n      fine clothes when they sat down on the floor to eat their dinner. The\r\n      great Earl of Warwick is said to have entertained every day, at his\r\n      different manors, 30,000 people; and though the number here may have been\r\n      exaggerated, it must, however, have been very great to admit of such\r\n      exaggeration. A hospitality nearly of the same kind was exercised not many\r\n      years ago in many different parts of the Highlands of Scotland. It seems\r\n      to be common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little\r\n      known. I have seen, says Doctor Pocock, an Arabian chief dine in the\r\n      streets of a town where he had come to sell his cattle, and invite all\r\n      passengers, even common beggars, to sit down with him and partake of his\r\n      banquet.\r\n\r\n      The occupiers of land were in every respect as dependent upon the great\r\n      proprietor as his retainers. Even such of them as were not in a state of\r\n      villanage, were tenants at will, who paid a rent in no respect equivalent\r\n      to the subsistence which the land afforded them. A crown, half a crown, a\r\n      sheep, a lamb, was some years ago, in the Highlands of Scotland, a common\r\n      rent for lands which maintained a family. In some places it is so at this\r\n      day; nor will money at present purchase a greater quantity of commodities\r\n      there than in other places. In a country where the surplus produce of a\r\n      large estate must be consumed upon the estate itself, it will frequently\r\n      be more convenient for the proprietor, that part of it be consumed at a\r\n      distance from his own house, provided they who consume it are as dependent\r\n      upon him as either his retainers or his menial servants. He is thereby\r\n      saved from the embarrassment of either too large a company, or too large a\r\n      family. A tenant at will, who possesses land sufficient to maintain his\r\n      family for little more than a quit-rent, is as dependent upon the\r\n      proprietor as any servant or retainer whatever, and must obey him with as\r\n      little reserve. Such a proprietor, as he feeds his servants and retainers\r\n      at his own house, so he feeds his tenants at their houses. The subsistence\r\n      of both is derived from his bounty, and its continuance depends upon his\r\n      good pleasure.\r\n\r\n      Upon the authority which the great proprietors necessarily had, in such a\r\n      state of things, over their tenants and retainers, was founded the power\r\n      of the ancient barons. They necessarily became the judges in peace, and\r\n      the leaders in war, of all who dwelt upon their estates. They could\r\n      maintain order, and execute the law, within their respective demesnes,\r\n      because each of them could there turn the whole force of all the\r\n      inhabitants against the injustice of anyone. No other person had\r\n      sufficient authority to do this. The king, in particular, had not. In\r\n      those ancient times, he was little more than the greatest proprietor in\r\n      his dominions, to whom, for the sake of common defence against their\r\n      common enemies, the other great proprietors paid certain respects. To have\r\n      enforced payment of a small debt within the lands of a great proprietor,\r\n      where all the inhabitants were armed, and accustomed to stand by one\r\n      another, would have cost the king, had he attempted it by his own\r\n      authority, almost the same effort as to extinguish a civil war. He was,\r\n      therefore, obliged to abandon the administration of justice, through the\r\n      greater part of the country, to those who were capable of administering\r\n      it; and, for the same reason, to leave the command of the country militia\r\n      to those whom that militia would obey.\r\n\r\n      It is a mistake to imagine that those territorial jurisdictions took their\r\n      origin from the feudal law. Not only the highest jurisdictions, both civil\r\n      and criminal, but the power of levying troops, of coining money, and even\r\n      that of making bye-laws for the government of their own people, were all\r\n      rights possessed allodially by the great proprietors of land, several\r\n      centuries before even the name of the feudal law was known in Europe. The\r\n      authority and jurisdiction of the Saxon lords in England appear to have\r\n      been as great before the Conquest as that of any of the Norman lords after\r\n      it. But the feudal law is not supposed to have become the common law of\r\n      England till after the Conquest. That the most extensive authority and\r\n      jurisdictions were possessed by the great lords in France allodially, long\r\n      before the feudal law was introduced into that country, is a matter of\r\n      fact that admits of no doubt. That authority, and those jurisdictions, all\r\n      necessarily flowed from the state of property and manners just now\r\n      described. Without remounting to the remote antiquities of either the\r\n      French or English monarchies, we may find, in much later times, many\r\n      proofs that such effects must always flow from such causes. It is not\r\n      thirty years ago since Mr Cameron of Lochiel, a gentleman of Lochaber in\r\n      Scotland, without any legal warrant whatever, not being what was then\r\n      called a lord of regality, nor even a tenant in chief, but a vassal of the\r\n      Duke of Argyll, and with out being so much as a justice of peace, used,\r\n      notwithstanding, to exercise the highest criminal jurisdictions over his\r\n      own people. He is said to have done so with great equity, though without\r\n      any of the formalities of justice; and it is not improbable that the state\r\n      of that part of the country at that time made it necessary for him to\r\n      assume this authority, in order to maintain the public peace. That\r\n      gentleman, whose rent never exceeded £500 a-year, carried, in 1745, 800 of\r\n      his own people into the rebellion with him.\r\n\r\n      The introduction of the feudal law, so far from extending, may be regarded\r\n      as an attempt to moderate, the authority of the great allodial lords. It\r\n      established a regular subordination, accompanied with a long train of\r\n      services and duties, from the king down to the smallest proprietor. During\r\n      the minority of the proprietor, the rent, together with the management of\r\n      his lands, fell into the hands of his immediate superior; and,\r\n      consequently, those of all great proprietors into the hands of the king,\r\n      who was charged with the maintenance and education of the pupil, and who,\r\n      from his authority as guardian, was supposed to have a right of disposing\r\n      of him in marriage, provided it was in a manner not unsuitable to his\r\n      rank. But though this institution necessarily tended to strengthen the\r\n      authority of the king, and to weaken that of the great proprietors, it\r\n      could not do either sufficiently for establishing order and good\r\n      government among the inhabitants of the country; because it could not\r\n      alter sufficiently that state of property and manners from which the\r\n      disorders arose. The authority of government still continued to be, as\r\n      before, too weak in the head, and too strong in the inferior members; and\r\n      the excessive strength of the inferior members was the cause of the\r\n      weakness of the head. After the institution of feudal subordination, the\r\n      king was as incapable of restraining the violence of the great lords as\r\n      before. They still continued to make war according to their own\r\n      discretion, almost continually upon one another, and very frequently upon\r\n      the king; and the open country still continued to be a scene of violence,\r\n      rapine, and disorder.\r\n\r\n      But what all the violence of the feudal institutions could never have\r\n      effected, the silent and insensible operation of foreign commerce and\r\n      manufactures gradually brought about. These gradually furnished the great\r\n      proprietors with something for which they could exchange the whole surplus\r\n      produce of their lands, and which they could consume themselves, without\r\n      sharing it either with tenants or retainers. All for ourselves, and\r\n      nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been\r\n      the vile maxim of the masters of mankind. As soon, therefore, as they\r\n      could find a method of consuming the whole value of their rents\r\n      themselves, they had no disposition to share them with any other persons.\r\n      For a pair of diamond buckles, perhaps, or for something as frivolous and\r\n      useless, they exchanged the maintenance, or, what is the same thing, the\r\n      price of the maintenance of 1000 men for a year, and with it the whole\r\n      weight and authority which it could give them. The buckles, however, were\r\n      to be all their own, and no other human creature was to have any share of\r\n      them; whereas, in the more ancient method of expense, they must have\r\n      shared with at least 1000 people. With the judges that were to determine\r\n      the preference, this difference was perfectly decisive; and thus, for the\r\n      gratification of the most childish, the meanest, and the most sordid of\r\n      all vanities they gradually bartered their whole power and authority.\r\n\r\n      In a country where there is no foreign commerce, nor any of the finer\r\n      manufactures, a man of £10,000 a-year cannot well employ his revenue in\r\n      any other way than in maintaining, perhaps, 1000 families, who are all of\r\n      them necessarily at his command. In the present state of Europe, a man of\r\n      £10,000 a-year can spend his whole revenue, and he generally does so,\r\n      without directly maintaining twenty people, or being able to command more\r\n      than ten footmen, not worth the commanding. Indirectly, perhaps, he\r\n      maintains as great, or even a greater number of people, than he could have\r\n      done by the ancient method of expense. For though the quantity of precious\r\n      productions for which he exchanges his whole revenue be very small, the\r\n      number of workmen employed in collecting and preparing it must necessarily\r\n      have been very great. Its great price generally arises from the wages of\r\n      their labour, and the profits of all their immediate employers. By paying\r\n      that price, he indirectly pays all those wages and profits, and thus\r\n      indirectly contributes to the maintenance of all the workmen and their\r\n      employers. He generally contributes, however, but a very small proportion\r\n      to that of each; to a very few, perhaps, not a tenth, to many not a\r\n      hundredth, and to some not a thousandth, or even a ten thousandth part of\r\n      their whole annual maintenance. Though he contributes, therefore, to the\r\n      maintenance of them all, they are all more or less independent of him,\r\n      because generally they can all be maintained without him.\r\n\r\n      When the great proprietors of land spend their rents in maintaining their\r\n      tenants and retainers, each of them maintains entirely all his own tenants\r\n      and all his own retainers. But when they spend them in maintaining\r\n      tradesmen and artificers, they may, all of them taken together, perhaps\r\n      maintain as great, or, on account of the waste which attends rustic\r\n      hospitality, a greater number of people than before. Each of them,\r\n      however, taken singly, contributes often but a very small share to the\r\n      maintenance of any individual of this greater number. Each tradesman or\r\n      artificer derives his subsistence from the employment, not of one, but of\r\n      a hundred or a thousand different customers. Though in some measure\r\n      obliged to them all, therefore, he is not absolutely dependent upon any\r\n      one of them.\r\n\r\n      The personal expense of the great proprietors having in this manner\r\n      gradually increased, it was impossible that the number of their retainers\r\n      should not as gradually diminish, till they were at last dismissed\r\n      altogether. The same cause gradually led them to dismiss the unnecessary\r\n      part of their tenants. Farms were enlarged, and the occupiers of land,\r\n      notwithstanding the complaints of depopulation, reduced to the number\r\n      necessary for cultivating it, according to the imperfect state of\r\n      cultivation and improvement in those times. By the removal of the\r\n      unnecessary mouths, and by exacting from the farmer the full value of the\r\n      farm, a greater surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of a\r\n      greater surplus, was obtained for the proprietor, which the merchants and\r\n      manufacturers soon furnished him with a method of spending upon his own\r\n      person, in the same manner as he had done the rest. The cause continuing\r\n      to operate, he was desirous to raise his rents above what his lands, in\r\n      the actual state of their improvement, could afford. His tenants could\r\n      agree to this upon one condition only, that they should be secured in\r\n      their possession for such a term of years as might give them time to\r\n      recover, with profit, whatever they should lay out in the further\r\n      improvement of the land. The expensive vanity of the landlord made him\r\n      willing to accept of this condition; and hence the origin of long leases.\r\n\r\n      Even a tenant at will, who pays the full value of the land, is not\r\n      altogether dependent upon the landlord. The pecuniary advantages which\r\n      they receive from one another are mutual and equal, and such a tenant will\r\n      expose neither his life nor his fortune in the service of the proprietor.\r\n      But if he has a lease for a long term of years he is altogether\r\n      independent; and his landlord must not expect from him even the most\r\n      trifling service, beyond what is either expressly stipulated in the lease,\r\n      or imposed upon him by the common and known law of the country.\r\n\r\n      The tenants having in this manner become independent, and the retainers\r\n      being dismissed, the great proprietors were no longer capable of\r\n      interrupting the regular execution of justice, or of disturbing the peace\r\n      of the country. Having sold their birth-right, not like Esau, for a mess\r\n      of pottage in time of hunger and necessity, but, in the wantonness of\r\n      plenty, for trinkets and baubles, fitter to be the playthings of children\r\n      than the serious pursuits of men, they became as insignificant as any\r\n      substantial burgher or tradesmen in a city. A regular government was\r\n      established in the country as well as in the city, nobody having\r\n      sufficient power to disturb its operations in the one, any more than in\r\n      the other.\r\n\r\n      It does not, perhaps, relate to the present subject, but I cannot help\r\n      remarking it, that very old families, such as have possessed some\r\n      considerable estate from father to son for many successive generations,\r\n      are very rare in commercial countries. In countries which have little\r\n      commerce, on the contrary, such as Wales, or the Highlands of Scotland,\r\n      they are very common. The Arabian histories seem to be all full of\r\n      genealogies; and there is a history written by a Tartar Khan, which has\r\n      been translated into several European languages, and which contains scarce\r\n      any thing else; a proof that ancient families are very common among those\r\n      nations. In countries where a rich man can spend his revenue in no other\r\n      way than by maintaining as many people as it can maintain, he is apt to\r\n      run out, and his benevolence, it seems, is seldom so violent as to attempt\r\n      to maintain more than he can afford. But where he can spend the greatest\r\n      revenue upon his own person, he frequently has no bounds to his expense,\r\n      because he frequently has no bounds to his vanity, or to his affection for\r\n      his own person. In commercial countries, therefore, riches, in spite of\r\n      the most violent regulations of law to prevent their dissipation, very\r\n      seldom remain long in the same family. Among simple nations, on the\r\n      contrary, they frequently do, without any regulations of law; for among\r\n      nations of shepherds, such as the Tartars and Arabs, the consumable nature\r\n      of their property necessarily renders all such regulations impossible.\r\n\r\n      A revolution of the greatest importance to the public happiness, was in\r\n      this manner brought about by two different orders of people, who had not\r\n      the least intention to serve the public. To gratify the most childish\r\n      vanity was the sole motive of the great proprietors. The merchants and\r\n      artificers, much less ridiculous, acted merely from a view to their own\r\n      interest, and in pursuit of their own pedlar principle of turning a penny\r\n      wherever a penny was to be got. Neither of them had either knowledge or\r\n      foresight of that great revolution which the folly of the one, and the\r\n      industry of the other, was gradually bringing about.\r\n\r\n      It was thus, that, through the greater part of Europe, the commerce and\r\n      manufactures of cities, instead of being the effect, have been the cause\r\n      and occasion of the improvement and cultivation of the country.\r\n\r\n      This order, however, being contrary to the natural course of things, is\r\n      necessarily both slow and uncertain. Compare the slow progress of those\r\n      European countries of which the wealth depends very much upon their\r\n      commerce and manufactures, with the rapid advances of our North American\r\n      colonies, of which the wealth is founded altogether in agriculture.\r\n      Through the greater part of Europe, the number of inhabitants is not\r\n      supposed to double in less than five hundred years. In several of our\r\n      North American colonies, it is found to double in twenty or\r\n      five-and-twenty years. In Europe, the law of primogeniture, and\r\n      perpetuities of different kinds, prevent the division of great estates,\r\n      and thereby hinder the multiplication of small proprietors. A small\r\n      proprietor, however, who knows every part of his little territory, views\r\n      it with all the affection which property, especially small property,\r\n      naturally inspires, and who upon that account takes pleasure, not only in\r\n      cultivating, but in adorning it, is generally of all improvers the most\r\n      industrious, the most intelligent, and the most successful. The same\r\n      regulations, besides, keep so much land out of the market, that there are\r\n      always more capitals to buy than there is land to sell, so that what is\r\n      sold always sells at a monopoly price. The rent never pays the interest of\r\n      the purchase-money, and is, besides, burdened with repairs and other\r\n      occasional charges, to which the interest of money is not liable. To\r\n      purchase land, is, everywhere in Europe, a most unprofitable employment of\r\n      a small capital. For the sake of the superior security, indeed, a man of\r\n      moderate circumstances, when he retires from business, will sometimes\r\n      choose to lay out his little capital in land. A man of profession, too\r\n      whose revenue is derived from another source often loves to secure his\r\n      savings in the same way. But a young man, who, instead of applying to\r\n      trade or to some profession, should employ a capital of two or three\r\n      thousand pounds in the purchase and cultivation of a small piece of land,\r\n      might indeed expect to live very happily and very independently, but must\r\n      bid adieu for ever to all hope of either great fortune or great\r\n      illustration, which, by a different employment of his stock, he might have\r\n      had the same chance of acquiring with other people. Such a person, too,\r\n      though he cannot aspire at being a proprietor, will often disdain to be a\r\n      farmer. The small quantity of land, therefore, which is brought to market,\r\n      and the high price of what is brought thither, prevents a great number of\r\n      capitals from being employed in its cultivation and improvement, which\r\n      would otherwise have taken that direction. In North America, on the\r\n      contrary, fifty or sixty pounds is often found a sufficient stock to begin\r\n      a plantation with. The purchase and improvement of uncultivated land is\r\n      there the most profitable employment of the smallest as well as of the\r\n      greatest capitals, and the most direct road to all the fortune and\r\n      illustration which can be required in that country. Such land, indeed, is\r\n      in North America to be had almost for nothing, or at a price much below\r\n      the value of the natural produce; a thing impossible in Europe, or indeed\r\n      in any country where all lands have long been private property. If landed\r\n      estates, however, were divided equally among all the children, upon the\r\n      death of any proprietor who left a numerous family, the estate would\r\n      generally be sold. So much land would come to market, that it could no\r\n      longer sell at a monopoly price. The free rent of the land would go no\r\n      nearer to pay the interest of the purchase-money, and a small capital\r\n      might be employed in purchasing land as profitable as in any other way.\r\n\r\n      England, on account of the natural fertility of the soil, of the great\r\n      extent of the sea-coast in proportion to that of the whole country, and of\r\n      the many navigable rivers which run through it, and afford the conveniency\r\n      of water carriage to some of the most inland parts of it, is perhaps as\r\n      well fitted by nature as any large country in Europe to be the seat of\r\n      foreign commerce, of manufactures for distant sale, and of all the\r\n      improvements which these can occasion. From the beginning of the reign of\r\n      Elizabeth, too, the English legislature has been peculiarly attentive to\r\n      the interest of commerce and manufactures, and in reality there is no\r\n      country in Europe, Holland itself not excepted, of which the law is, upon\r\n      the whole, more favourable to this sort of industry. Commerce and\r\n      manufactures have accordingly been continually advancing during all this\r\n      period. The cultivation and improvement of the country has, no doubt, been\r\n      gradually advancing too; but it seems to have followed slowly, and at a\r\n      distance, the more rapid progress of commerce and manufactures. The\r\n      greater part of the country must probably have been cultivated before the\r\n      reign of Elizabeth; and a very great part of it still remains\r\n      uncultivated, and the cultivation of the far greater part much inferior to\r\n      what it might be, The law of England, however, favours agriculture, not\r\n      only indirectly, by the protection of commerce, but by several direct\r\n      encouragements. Except in times of scarcity, the exportation of corn is\r\n      not only free, but encouraged by a bounty. In times of moderate plenty,\r\n      the importation of foreign corn is loaded with duties that amount to a\r\n      prohibition. The importation of live cattle, except from Ireland, is\r\n      prohibited at all times; and it is but of late that it was permitted from\r\n      thence. Those who cultivate the land, therefore, have a monopoly against\r\n      their countrymen for the two greatest and most important articles of land\r\n      produce, bread and butcher’s meat. These encouragements, although at\r\n      bottom, perhaps, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter, altogether\r\n      illusory, sufficiently demonstrate at least the good intention of the\r\n      legislature to favour agriculture. But what is of much more importance\r\n      than all of them, the yeomanry of England are rendered as secure, as\r\n      independent, and as respectable, as law can make them. No country,\r\n      therefore, which the right of primogeniture takes place, which pays\r\n      tithes, and where perpetuities, though contrary to the spirit of the law,\r\n      are admitted in some cases, can give more encouragement to agriculture\r\n      than England. Such, however, notwithstanding, is the state of its\r\n      cultivation. What would it have been, had the law given no direct\r\n      encouragement to agriculture besides what arises indirectly from the\r\n      progress of commerce, and had left the yeomanry in the same condition as\r\n      in most other countries of Europe? It is now more than two hundred years\r\n      since the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, a period as long as the\r\n      course of human prosperity usually endures.\r\n\r\n      France seems to have had a considerable share of foreign commerce, near a\r\n      century before England was distinguished as a commercial country. The\r\n      marine of France was considerable, according to the notions of the times,\r\n      before the expedition of Charles VIII. to Naples. The cultivation and\r\n      improvement of France, however, is, upon the whole, inferior to that of\r\n      England. The law of the country has never given the same direct\r\n      encouragement to agriculture.\r\n\r\n      The foreign commerce of Spain and Portugal to the other parts of Europe,\r\n      though chiefly carried on in foreign ships, is very considerable. That to\r\n      their colonies is carried on in their own, and is much greater, on account\r\n      of the great riches and extent of those colonies. But it has never\r\n      introduced any considerable manufactures for distant sale into either of\r\n      those countries, and the greater part of both still remains uncultivated.\r\n      The foreign commerce of Portugal is of older standing than that of any\r\n      great country in Europe, except Italy.\r\n\r\n      Italy is the only great country of Europe which seems to have been\r\n      cultivated and improved in every part, by means of foreign commerce and\r\n      manufactures for distant sale. Before the invasion of Charles VIII.,\r\n      Italy, according to Guicciardini, was cultivated not less in the most\r\n      mountainous and barren parts of the country, than in the plainest and most\r\n      fertile. The advantageous situation of the country, and the great number\r\n      of independent states which at that time subsisted in it, probably\r\n      contributed not a little to this general cultivation. It is not\r\n      impossible, too, notwithstanding this general expression of one of the\r\n      most judicious and reserved of modern historians, that Italy was not at\r\n      that time better cultivated than England is at present.\r\n\r\n      The capital, however, that is acquired to any country by commerce and\r\n      manufactures, is always a very precarious and uncertain possession, till\r\n      some part of it has been secured and realized in the cultivation and\r\n      improvement of its lands. A merchant, it has been said very properly, is\r\n      not necessarily the citizen of any particular country. It is in a great\r\n      measure indifferent to him from what place he carries on his trade; and a\r\n      very trifling disgust will make him remove his capital, and, together with\r\n      it, all the industry which it supports, from one country to another. No\r\n      part of it can be said to belong to any particular country, till it has\r\n      been spread, as it were, over the face of that country, either in\r\n      buildings, or in the lasting improvement of lands. No vestige now remains\r\n      of the great wealth said to have been possessed by the greater part of the\r\n      Hanse Towns, except in the obscure histories of the thirteenth and\r\n      fourteenth centuries. It is even uncertain where some of them were\r\n      situated, or to what towns in Europe the Latin names given to some of them\r\n      belong. But though the misfortunes of Italy, in the end of the fifteenth\r\n      and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, greatly diminished the commerce\r\n      and manufactures of the cities of Lombardy and Tuscany, those countries\r\n      still continue to be among the most populous and best cultivated in\r\n      Europe. The civil wars of Flanders, and the Spanish government which\r\n      succeeded them, chased away the great commerce of Antwerp, Ghent, and\r\n      Bruges. But Flanders still continues to be one of the richest, best\r\n      cultivated, and most populous provinces of Europe. The ordinary\r\n      revolutions of war and government easily dry up the sources of that wealth\r\n      which arises from commerce only. That which arises from the more solid\r\n      improvements of agriculture is much more durable, and cannot be destroyed\r\n      but by those more violent convulsions occasioned by the depredations of\r\n      hostile and barbarous nations continued for a century or two together;\r\n      such as those that happened for some time before and after the fall of the\r\n      Roman empire in the western provinces of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\nOF SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Political economy, considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or\r\n      legislator, proposes two distinct objects; first, to provide a plentiful\r\n      revenue or subsistence for the people, or, more properly, to enable them\r\n      to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and, secondly, to\r\n      supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public\r\n      services. It proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign.\r\n\r\n      The different progress of opulence in different ages and nations, has\r\n      given occasion to two different systems of political economy, with regard\r\n      to enriching the people. The one may be called the system of commerce, the\r\n      other that of agriculture. I shall endeavour to explain both as fully and\r\n      distinctly as I can, and shall begin with the system of commerce. It is\r\n      the modern system, and is best understood in our own country and in our\r\n      own times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMERCIAL OR\r\nMERCANTILE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      That wealth consists in money, or in gold and silver, is a popular notion\r\n      which naturally arises from the double function of money, as the\r\n      instrument of commerce, and as the measure of value. In consequence of its\r\n      being the instrument of commerce, when we have money we can more readily\r\n      obtain whatever else we have occasion for, than by means of any other\r\n      commodity. The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When that is\r\n      obtained, there is no difficulty in making any subsequent purchase. In\r\n      consequence of its being the measure of value, we estimate that of all\r\n      other commodities by the quantity of money which they will exchange for.\r\n      We say of a rich man, that he is worth a great deal, and of a poor man,\r\n      that he is worth very little money. A frugal man, or a man eager to be\r\n      rich, is said to love money; and a careless, a generous, or a profuse man,\r\n      is said to be indifferent about it. To grow rich is to get money; and\r\n      wealth and money, in short, are, in common language, considered as in\r\n      every respect synonymous.\r\n\r\n      A rich country, in the same manner as a rich man, is supposed to be a\r\n      country abounding in money; and to heap up gold and silver in any country\r\n      is supposed to be the readiest way to enrich it. For some time after the\r\n      discovery of America, the first inquiry of the Spaniards, when they\r\n      arrived upon any unknown coast, used to be, if there was any gold or\r\n      silver to be found in the neighbourhood? By the information which they\r\n      received, they judged whether it was worth while to make a settlement\r\n      there, or if the country was worth the conquering. Plano Carpino, a monk\r\n      sent ambassador from the king of France to one of the sons of the famous\r\n      Gengis Khan, says, that the Tartars used frequently to ask him, if there\r\n      was plenty of sheep and oxen in the kingdom of France? Their inquiry had\r\n      the same object with that of the Spaniards. They wanted to know if the\r\n      country was rich enough to be worth the conquering. Among the Tartars, as\r\n      among all other nations of shepherds, who are generally ignorant of the\r\n      use of money, cattle are the instruments of commerce and the measures of\r\n      value. Wealth, therefore, according to them, consisted in cattle, as,\r\n      according to the Spaniards, it consisted in gold and silver. Of the two,\r\n      the Tartar notion, perhaps, was the nearest to the truth.\r\n\r\n      Mr Locke remarks a distinction between money and other moveable goods. All\r\n      other moveable goods, he says, are of so consumable a nature, that the\r\n      wealth which consists in them cannot be much depended on; and a nation\r\n      which abounds in them one year may, without any exportation, but merely by\r\n      their own waste and extravagance, be in great want of them the next.\r\n      Money, on the contrary, is a steady friend, which, though it may travel\r\n      about from hand to hand, yet if it can be kept from going out of the\r\n      country, is not very liable to be wasted and consumed. Gold and silver,\r\n      therefore, are, according to him, the must solid and substantial part of\r\n      the moveable wealth of a nation; and to multiply those metals ought, he\r\n      thinks, upon that account, to be the great object of its political\r\n      economy.\r\n\r\n      Others admit, that if a nation could be separated from all the world, it\r\n      would be of no consequence how much or how little money circulated in it.\r\n      The consumable goods, which were circulated by means of this money, would\r\n      only be exchanged for a greater or a smaller number of pieces; but the\r\n      real wealth or poverty of the country, they allow, would depend altogether\r\n      upon the abundance or scarcity of those consumable goods. But it is\r\n      otherwise, they think, with countries which have connections with foreign\r\n      nations, and which are obliged to carry on foreign wars, and to maintain\r\n      fleets and armies in distant countries. This, they say, cannot be done,\r\n      but by sending abroad money to pay them with; and a nation cannot send\r\n      much money abroad, unless it has a good deal at home. Every such nation,\r\n      therefore, must endeavour, in time of peace, to accumulate gold and\r\n      silver, that when occasion requires, it may have wherewithal to carry on\r\n      foreign wars.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of those popular notions, all the different nations of\r\n      Europe have studied, though to little purpose, every possible means of\r\n      accumulating gold and silver in their respective countries. Spain and\r\n      Portugal, the proprietors of the principal mines which supply Europe with\r\n      those metals, have either prohibited their exportation under the severest\r\n      penalties, or subjected it to a considerable duty. The like prohibition\r\n      seems anciently to have made a part of the policy of most other European\r\n      nations. It is even to be found, where we should least of all expect to\r\n      find it, in some old Scotch acts of Parliament, which forbid, under heavy\r\n      penalties, the carrying gold or silver forth of the kingdom. The like\r\n      policy anciently took place both in France and England.\r\n\r\n      When those countries became commercial, the merchants found this\r\n      prohibition, upon many occasions, extremely inconvenient. They could\r\n      frequently buy more advantageously with gold and silver, than with any\r\n      other commodity, the foreign goods which they wanted, either to import\r\n      into their own, or to carry to some other foreign country. They\r\n      remonstrated, therefore, against this prohibition as hurtful to trade.\r\n\r\n      They represented, first, that the exportation of gold and silver, in order\r\n      to purchase foreign goods, did not always diminish the quantity of those\r\n      metals in the kingdom; that, on the contrary, it might frequently increase\r\n      the quantity; because, if the consumption of foreign goods was not thereby\r\n      increased in the country, those goods might be re-exported to foreign\r\n      countries, and being there sold for a large profit, might bring back much\r\n      more treasure than was originally sent out to purchase them. Mr Mun\r\n      compares this operation of foreign trade to the seed-time and harvest of\r\n      agriculture. “If we only behold,” says he, “the actions of the husbandman\r\n      in the seed time, when he casteth away much good corn into the ground, we\r\n      shall account him rather a madman than a husbandman. But when we consider\r\n      his labours in the harvest, which is the end of his endeavours, we shall\r\n      find the worth and plentiful increase of his actions.”\r\n\r\n      They represented, secondly, that this prohibition could not hinder the\r\n      exportation of gold and silver, which, on account of the smallness of\r\n      their bulk in proportion to their value, could easily be smuggled abroad.\r\n      That this exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to\r\n      what they called the balance of trade. That when the country exported to a\r\n      greater value than it imported, a balance became due to it from foreign\r\n      nations, which was necessarily paid to it in gold and silver, and thereby\r\n      increased the quantity of those metals in the kingdom. But that when it\r\n      imported to a greater value than it exported, a contrary balance became\r\n      due to foreign nations, which was necessarily paid to them in the same\r\n      manner, and thereby diminished that quantity: that in this case, to\r\n      prohibit the exportation of those metals, could not prevent it, but only,\r\n      by making it more dangerous, render it more expensive: that the exchange\r\n      was thereby turned more against the country which owed the balance, than\r\n      it otherwise might have been; the merchant who purchased a bill upon the\r\n      foreign country being obliged to pay the banker who sold it, not only for\r\n      the natural risk, trouble, and expense of sending the money thither, but\r\n      for the extraordinary risk arising from the prohibition; but that the more\r\n      the exchange was against any country, the more the balance of trade became\r\n      necessarily against it; the money of that country becoming necessarily of\r\n      so much less value, in comparison with that of the country to which the\r\n      balance was due. That if the exchange between England and Holland, for\r\n      example, was five per cent. against England, it would require 105 ounces\r\n      of silver in England to purchase a bill for 100 ounces of silver in\r\n      Holland: that 105 ounces of silver in England, therefore, would be worth\r\n      only 100 ounces of silver in Holland, and would purchase only a\r\n      proportionable quantity of Dutch goods; but that 100 ounces of silver in\r\n      Holland, on the contrary, would be worth 105 ounces in England, and would\r\n      purchase a proportionable quantity of English goods; that the English\r\n      goods which were sold to Holland would be sold so much cheaper, and the\r\n      Dutch goods which were sold to England so much dearer, by the difference\r\n      of the exchange: that the one would draw so much less Dutch money to\r\n      England, and the other so much more English money to Holland, as this\r\n      difference amounted to: and that the balance of trade, therefore, would\r\n      necessarily be so much more against England, and would require a greater\r\n      balance of gold and silver to be exported to Holland.\r\n\r\n      Those arguments were partly solid and partly sophistical. They were solid,\r\n      so far as they asserted that the exportation of gold and silver in trade\r\n      might frequently be advantageous to the country. They were solid, too, in\r\n      asserting that no prohibition could prevent their exportation, when\r\n      private people found any advantage in exporting them. But they were\r\n      sophistical, in supposing, that either to preserve or to augment the\r\n      quantity of those metals required more the attention of government, than\r\n      to preserve or to augment the quantity of any other useful commodities,\r\n      which the freedom of trade, without any such attention, never fails to\r\n      supply in the proper quantity. They were sophistical, too, perhaps, in\r\n      asserting that the high price of exchange necessarily increased what they\r\n      called the unfavourable balance of trade, or occasioned the exportation of\r\n      a greater quantity of gold and silver. That high price, indeed, was\r\n      extremely disadvantageous to the merchants who had any money to pay in\r\n      foreign countries. They paid so much dearer for the bills which their\r\n      bankers granted them upon those countries. But though the risk arising\r\n      from the prohibition might occasion some extraordinary expense to the\r\n      bankers, it would not necessarily carry any more money out of the country.\r\n      This expense would generally be all laid out in the country, in smuggling\r\n      the money out of it, and could seldom occasion the exportation of a single\r\n      sixpence beyond the precise sum drawn for. The high price of exchange,\r\n      too, would naturally dispose the merchants to endeavour to make their\r\n      exports nearly balance their imports, in order that they might have this\r\n      high exchange to pay upon as small a sum as possible. The high price of\r\n      exchange, besides, must necessarily have operated as a tax, in raising the\r\n      price of foreign goods, and thereby diminishing their consumption. It\r\n      would tend, therefore, not to increase, but to diminish, what they called\r\n      the unfavourable balance of trade, and consequently the exportation of\r\n      gold and silver.\r\n\r\n      Such as they were, however, those arguments convinced the people to whom\r\n      they were addressed. They were addressed by merchants to parliaments and\r\n      to the councils of princes, to nobles, and to country gentlemen; by those\r\n      who were supposed to understand trade, to those who were conscious to them\r\n      selves that they knew nothing about the matter. That foreign trade\r\n      enriched the country, experience demonstrated to the nobles and country\r\n      gentlemen, as well as to the merchants; but how, or in what manner, none\r\n      of them well knew. The merchants knew perfectly in what manner it enriched\r\n      themselves, it was their business to know it. But to know in what manner\r\n      it enriched the country, was no part of their business. The subject never\r\n      came into their consideration, but when they had occasion to apply to\r\n      their country for some change in the laws relating to foreign trade. It\r\n      then became necessary to say something about the beneficial effects of\r\n      foreign trade, and the manner in which those effects were obstructed by\r\n      the laws as they then stood. To the judges who were to decide the\r\n      business, it appeared a most satisfactory account of the matter, when they\r\n      were told that foreign trade brought money into the country, but that the\r\n      laws in question hindered it from bringing so much as it otherwise would\r\n      do. Those arguments, therefore, produced the wished-for effect. The\r\n      prohibition of exporting gold and silver was, in France and England,\r\n      confined to the coin of those respective countries. The exportation of\r\n      foreign coin and of bullion was made free. In Holland, and in some other\r\n      places, this liberty was extended even to the coin of the country. The\r\n      attention of government was turned away from guarding against the\r\n      exportation of gold and silver, to watch over the balance of trade, as the\r\n      only cause which could occasion any augmentation or diminution of those\r\n      metals. From one fruitless care, it was turned away to another care much\r\n      more intricate, much more embarrassing, and just equally fruitless. The\r\n      title of Mun’s book, England’s Treasure in Foreign Trade, became a\r\n      fundamental maxim in the political economy, not of England only, but of\r\n      all other commercial countries. The inland or home trade, the most\r\n      important of all, the trade in which an equal capital affords the greatest\r\n      revenue, and creates the greatest employment to the people of the country,\r\n      was considered as subsidiary only to foreign trade. It neither brought\r\n      money into the country, it was said, nor carried any out of it. The\r\n      country, therefore, could never become either richer or poorer by means of\r\n      it, except so far as its prosperity or decay might indirectly influence\r\n      the state of foreign trade.\r\n\r\n      A country that has no mines of its own, must undoubtedly draw its gold and\r\n      silver from foreign countries, in the same manner as one that has no\r\n      vineyards of its own must draw its wines. It does not seem necessary,\r\n      however, that the attention of government should be more turned towards\r\n      the one than towards the other object. A country that has wherewithal to\r\n      buy wine, will always get the wine which it has occasion for; and a\r\n      country that has wherewithal to buy gold and silver, will never be in want\r\n      of those metals. They are to be bought for a certain price, like all other\r\n      commodities; and as they are the price of all other commodities, so all\r\n      other commodities are the price of those metals. We trust, with perfect\r\n      security, that the freedom of trade, without any attention of government,\r\n      will always supply us with the wine which we have occasion for; and we may\r\n      trust, with equal security, that it will always supply us with all the\r\n      gold and silver which we can afford to purchase or to employ, either in\r\n      circulating our commodities or in other uses.\r\n\r\n      The quantity of every commodity which human industry can either purchase\r\n      or produce, naturally regulates itself in every country according to the\r\n      effectual demand, or according to the demand of those who are willing to\r\n      pay the whole rent, labour, and profits, which must be paid in order to\r\n      prepare and bring it to market. But no commodities regulate themselves\r\n      more easily or more exactly, according to this effectual demand, than gold\r\n      and silver; because, on account of the small bulk and great value of those\r\n      metals, no commodities can be more easily transported from one place to\r\n      another; from the places where they are cheap, to those where they are\r\n      dear; from the places where they exceed, to those where they fall short of\r\n      this effectual demand. If there were in England, for example, an effectual\r\n      demand for an additional quantity of gold, a packet-boat could bring from\r\n      Lisbon, or from wherever else it was to be had, fifty tons of gold, which\r\n      could be coined into more than five millions of guineas. But if there were\r\n      an effectual demand for grain to the same value, to import it would\r\n      require, at five guineas a-ton, a million of tons of shipping, or a\r\n      thousand ships of a thousand tons each. The navy of England would not be\r\n      sufficient.\r\n\r\n      When the quantity of gold and silver imported into any country exceeds the\r\n      effectual demand, no vigilance of government can prevent their\r\n      exportation. All the sanguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able to\r\n      keep their gold and silver at home. The continual importations from Peru\r\n      and Brazil exceed the effectual demand of those countries, and sink the\r\n      price of those metals there below that in the neighbouring countries. If,\r\n      on the contrary, in any particular country, their quantity fell short of\r\n      the effectual demand, so as to raise their price above that of the\r\n      neighbouring countries, the government would have no occasion to take any\r\n      pains to import them. If it were even to take pains to prevent their\r\n      importation, it would not be able to effectuate it. Those metals, when the\r\n      Spartans had got wherewithal to purchase them, broke through all the\r\n      barriers which the laws of Lycurgus opposed to their entrance into\r\n      Lacedaemon. All the sanguinary laws of the customs are not able to prevent\r\n      the importation of the teas of the Dutch and Gottenburg East India\r\n      companies; because somewhat cheaper than those of the British company. A\r\n      pound of tea, however, is about a hundred times the bulk of one of the\r\n      highest prices, sixteen shillings, that is commonly paid for it in silver,\r\n      and more than two thousand times the bulk of the same price in gold, and,\r\n      consequently, just so many times more difficult to smuggle.\r\n\r\n      It is partly owing to the easy transportation of gold and silver, from the\r\n      places where they abound to those where they are wanted, that the price of\r\n      those metals does not fluctuate continually, like that of the greater part\r\n      of other commodities, which are hindered by their bulk from shifting their\r\n      situation, when the market happens to be either over or under-stocked with\r\n      them. The price of those metals, indeed, is not altogether exempted from\r\n      variation; but the changes to which it is liable are generally slow,\r\n      gradual, and uniform. In Europe, for example, it is supposed, without much\r\n      foundation, perhaps, that during the course of the present and preceding\r\n      century, they have been constantly, but gradually, sinking in their value,\r\n      on account of the continual importations from the Spanish West Indies. But\r\n      to make any sudden change in the price of gold and silver, so as to raise\r\n      or lower at once, sensibly and remarkably, the money price of all other\r\n      commodities, requires such a revolution in commerce as that occasioned by\r\n      the discovery of America.\r\n\r\n      If, not withstanding all this, gold and silver should at any time fall\r\n      short in a country which has wherewithal to purchase them, there are more\r\n      expedients for supplying their place, than that of almost any other\r\n      commodity. If the materials of manufacture are wanted, industry must stop.\r\n      If provisions are wanted, the people must starve. But if money is wanted,\r\n      barter will supply its place, though with a good deal of inconveniency.\r\n      Buying and selling upon credit, and the different dealers compensating\r\n      their credits with one another, once a-month, or once a-year, will supply\r\n      it with less inconveniency. A well-regulated paper-money will supply it\r\n      not only without any inconveniency, but, in some cases, with some\r\n      advantages. Upon every account, therefore, the attention of government\r\n      never was so unnecessarily employed, as when directed to watch over the\r\n      preservation or increase of the quantity of money in any country.\r\n\r\n      No complaint, however, is more common than that of a scarcity of money.\r\n      Money, like wine, must always be scarce with those who have neither\r\n      wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it. Those who have either,\r\n      will seldom be in want either of the money, or of the wine which they have\r\n      occasion for. This complaint, however, of the scarcity of money, is not\r\n      always confined to improvident spendthrifts. It is sometimes general\r\n      through a whole mercantile town and the country in its neighbourhood.\r\n      Over-trading is the common cause of it. Sober men, whose projects have\r\n      been disproportioned to their capitals, are as likely to have neither\r\n      wherewithal to buy money, nor credit to borrow it, as prodigals, whose\r\n      expense has been disproportioned to their revenue. Before their projects\r\n      can be brought to bear, their stock is gone, and their credit with it.\r\n      They run about everywhere to borrow money, and everybody tells them that\r\n      they have none to lend. Even such general complaints of the scarcity of\r\n      money do not always prove that the usual number of gold and silver pieces\r\n      are not circulating in the country, but that many people want those pieces\r\n      who have nothing to give for them. When the profits of trade happen to be\r\n      greater than ordinary over-trading becomes a general error, both among\r\n      great and small dealers. They do not always send more money abroad than\r\n      usual, but they buy upon credit, both at home and abroad, an unusual\r\n      quantity of goods, which they send to some distant market, in hopes that\r\n      the returns will come in before the demand for payment. The demand comes\r\n      before the returns, and they have nothing at hand with which they can\r\n      either purchase money or give solid security for borrowing. It is not any\r\n      scarcity of gold and silver, but the difficulty which such people find in\r\n      borrowing, and which their creditor find in getting payment, that\r\n      occasions the general complaint of the scarcity of money.\r\n\r\n      It would be too ridiculous to go about seriously to prove, that wealth\r\n      does not consist in money, or in gold and silver; but in what money\r\n      purchases, and is valuable only for purchasing. Money, no doubt, makes\r\n      always a part of the national capital; but it has already been shown that\r\n      it generally makes but a small part, and always the most unprofitable part\r\n      of it.\r\n\r\n      It is not because wealth consists more essentially in money than in goods,\r\n      that the merchant finds it generally more easy to buy goods with money,\r\n      than to buy money with goods; but because money is the known and\r\n      established instrument of commerce, for which every thing is readily given\r\n      in exchange, but which is not always with equal readiness to be got in\r\n      exchange for every thing. The greater part of goods, besides, are more\r\n      perishable than money, and he may frequently sustain a much greater loss\r\n      by keeping them. When his goods are upon hand, too, he is more liable to\r\n      such demands for money as he may not be able to answer, than when he has\r\n      got their price in his coffers. Over and above all this, his profit arises\r\n      more directly from selling than from buying; and he is, upon all these\r\n      accounts, generally much more anxious to exchange his goods for money than\r\n      his money for goods. But though a particular merchant, with abundance of\r\n      goods in his warehouse, may sometimes be ruined by not being able to sell\r\n      them in time, a nation or country is not liable to the same accident, The\r\n      whole capital of a merchant frequently consists in perishable goods\r\n      destined for purchasing money. But it is but a very small part of the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of a country, which can ever be\r\n      destined for purchasing gold and silver from their neighbours. The far\r\n      greater part is circulated and consumed among themselves; and even of the\r\n      surplus which is sent abroad, the greater part is generally destined for\r\n      the purchase of other foreign goods. Though gold and silver, therefore,\r\n      could not be had in exchange for the goods destined to purchase them, the\r\n      nation would not be ruined. It might, indeed, suffer some loss and\r\n      inconveniency, and be forced upon some of those expedients which are\r\n      necessary for supplying the place of money. The annual produce of its land\r\n      and labour, however, would be the same, or very nearly the same as usual;\r\n      because the same, or very nearly the same consumable capital would be\r\n      employed in maintaining it. And though goods do not always draw money so\r\n      readily as money draws goods, in the long-run they draw it more\r\n      necessarily than even it draws them. Goods can serve many other purposes\r\n      besides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides\r\n      purchasing goods. Money, therefore, necessarily runs after goods, but\r\n      goods do not always or necessarily run after money. The man who buys, does\r\n      not always mean to sell again, but frequently to use or to consume;\r\n      whereas he who sells always means to buy again. The one may frequently\r\n      have done the whole, but the other can never have done more than the one\r\n      half of his business. It is not for its own sake that men desire money,\r\n      but for the sake of what they can purchase with it.\r\n\r\n      Consumable commodities, it is said, are soon destroyed; whereas gold and\r\n      silver are of a more durable nature, and were it not for this continual\r\n      exportation, might be accumulated for ages together, to the incredible\r\n      augmentation of the real wealth of the country. Nothing, therefore, it is\r\n      pretended, can be more disadvantageous to any country, than the trade\r\n      which consists in the exchange of such lasting for such perishable\r\n      commodities. We do not, however, reckon that trade disadvantageous, which\r\n      consists in the exchange of the hardware of England for the wines of\r\n      France, and yet hardware is a very durable commodity, and were it not for\r\n      this continual exportation, might too be accumulated for ages together, to\r\n      the incredible augmentation of the pots and pans of the country. But it\r\n      readily occurs, that the number of such utensils is in every country\r\n      necessarily limited by the use which there is for them; that it would be\r\n      absurd to have more pots and pans than were necessary for cooking the\r\n      victuals usually consumed there; and that, if the quantity of victuals\r\n      were to increase, the number of pots and pans would readily increase along\r\n      with it; a part of the increased quantity of victuals being employed in\r\n      purchasing them, or in maintaining an additional number of workmen whose\r\n      business it was to make them. It should as readily occur, that the\r\n      quantity of gold and silver is, in every country, limited by the use which\r\n      there is for those metals; that their use consists in circulating\r\n      commodities, as coin, and in affording a species of household furniture,\r\n      as plate; that the quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the\r\n      value of the commodities which are to be circulated by it; increase that\r\n      value, and immediately a part of it will be sent abroad to purchase,\r\n      wherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of coin requisite for\r\n      circulating them: that the quantity of plate is regulated by the number\r\n      and wealth of those private families who choose to indulge themselves in\r\n      that sort of magnificence; increase the number and wealth of such\r\n      families, and a part of this increased wealth will most probably be\r\n      employed in purchasing, wherever it is to be found, an additional quantity\r\n      of plate; that to attempt to increase the wealth of any country, either by\r\n      introducing or by detaining in it an unnecessary quantity of gold and\r\n      silver, is as absurd as it would be to attempt to increase the good cheer\r\n      of private families, by obliging them to keep an unnecessary number of\r\n      kitchen utensils. As the expense of purchasing those unnecessary utensils\r\n      would diminish, instead of increasing, either the quantity or goodness of\r\n      the family provisions; so the expense of purchasing an unnecessary\r\n      quantity of gold and silver must, in every country, as necessarily\r\n      diminish the wealth which feeds, clothes, and lodges, which maintains and\r\n      employs the people. Gold and silver, whether in the shape of coin or of\r\n      plate, are utensils, it must be remembered, as much as the furniture of\r\n      the kitchen. Increase the use of them, increase the consumable commodities\r\n      which are to be circulated, managed, and prepared by means of them, and\r\n      you will infallibly increase the quantity; but if you attempt by\r\n      extraordinary means to increase the quantity, you will as infallibly\r\n      diminish the use, and even the quantity too, which in those metals can\r\n      never be greater than what the use requires. Were they ever to be\r\n      accumulated beyond this quantity, their transportation is so easy, and the\r\n      loss which attends their lying idle and unemployed so great, that no law\r\n      could prevent their being immediately sent out of the country.\r\n\r\n      It is not always necessary to accumulate gold and silver, in order to\r\n      enable a country to carry on foreign wars, and to maintain fleets and\r\n      armies in distant countries. Fleets and armies are maintained, not with\r\n      gold and silver, but with consumable goods. The nation which, from the\r\n      annual produce of its domestic industry, from the annual revenue arising\r\n      out of its lands, and labour, and consumable stock, has wherewithal to\r\n      purchase those consumable goods in distant countries, can maintain foreign\r\n      wars there.\r\n\r\n      A nation may purchase the pay and provisions of an army in a distant\r\n      country three different ways; by sending abroad either, first, some part\r\n      of its accumulated gold and silver; or, secondly, some part of the annual\r\n      produce of its manufactures; or, last of all, some part of its annual rude\r\n      produce.\r\n\r\n      The gold and silver which can properly be considered as accumulated, or\r\n      stored up in any country, may be distinguished into three parts; first,\r\n      the circulating money; secondly, the plate of private families; and, last\r\n      of all, the money which may have been collected by many years parsimony,\r\n      and laid up in the treasury of the prince.\r\n\r\n      It can seldom happen that much can be spared from the circulating money of\r\n      the country; because in that there can seldom be much redundancy. The\r\n      value of goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain\r\n      quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper\r\n      consumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of circulation\r\n      necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never admits\r\n      any more. Something, however, is generally withdrawn from this channel in\r\n      the case of foreign war. By the great number of people who are maintained\r\n      abroad, fewer are maintained at home. Fewer goods are circulated there,\r\n      and less money becomes necessary to circulate them. An extraordinary\r\n      quantity of paper money of some sort or other, too, such as exchequer\r\n      notes, navy bills, and bank bills, in England, is generally issued upon\r\n      such occasions, and, by supplying the place of circulating gold and\r\n      silver, gives an opportunity of sending a greater quantity of it abroad.\r\n      All this, however, could afford but a poor resource for maintaining a\r\n      foreign war, of great expense, and several years duration.\r\n\r\n      The melting down of the plate of private families has, upon every\r\n      occasion, been found a still more insignificant one. The French, in the\r\n      beginning of the last war, did not derive so much advantage from this\r\n      expedient as to compensate the loss of the fashion.\r\n\r\n      The accumulated treasures of the prince have in former times afforded a\r\n      much greater and more lasting resource. In the present times, if you\r\n      except the king of Prussia, to accumulate treasure seems to be no part of\r\n      the policy of European princes.\r\n\r\n      The funds which maintained the foreign wars of the present century, the\r\n      most expensive perhaps which history records, seem to have had little\r\n      dependency upon the exportation either of the circulating money, or of the\r\n      plate of private families, or of the treasure of the prince. The last\r\n      French war cost Great Britain upwards of £90,000,000, including not only\r\n      the £75,000,000 of new debt that was contracted, but the additional 2s. in\r\n      the pound land-tax, and what was annually borrowed of the sinking fund.\r\n      More than two-thirds of this expense were laid out in distant countries;\r\n      in Germany, Portugal, America, in the ports of the Mediterranean, in the\r\n      East and West Indies. The kings of England had no accumulated treasure. We\r\n      never heard of any extraordinary quantity of plate being melted down. The\r\n      circulating gold and silver of the country had not been supposed to exceed\r\n      £18,000,000. Since the late recoinage of the gold, however, it is believed\r\n      to have been a good deal under-rated. Let us suppose, therefore, according\r\n      to the most exaggerated computation which I remember to have either seen\r\n      or heard of, that, gold and silver together, it amounted to £30,000,000.\r\n      Had the war been carried on by means of our money, the whole of it must,\r\n      even according to this computation, have been sent out and returned again,\r\n      at least twice in a period of between six and seven years. Should this be\r\n      supposed, it would afford the most decisive argument, to demonstrate how\r\n      unnecessary it is for government to watch over the preservation of money,\r\n      since, upon this supposition, the whole money of the country must have\r\n      gone from it, and returned to it again, two different times in so short a\r\n      period, without any body’s knowing any thing of the matter. The channel of\r\n      circulation, however, never appeared more empty than usual during any part\r\n      of this period. Few people wanted money who had wherewithal to pay for it.\r\n      The profits of foreign trade, indeed, were greater than usual during the\r\n      whole war, but especially towards the end of it. This occasioned, what it\r\n      always occasions, a general over-trading in all the ports of Great\r\n      Britain; and this again occasioned the usual complaint of the scarcity of\r\n      money, which always follows over-trading. Many people wanted it, who had\r\n      neither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it; and because the\r\n      debtors found it difficult to borrow, the creditors found it difficult to\r\n      get payment. Gold and silver, however, were generally to be had for their\r\n      value, by those who had that value to give for them.\r\n\r\n      The enormous expense of the late war, therefore, must have been chiefly\r\n      defrayed, not by the exportation of gold and silver, but by that of\r\n      British commodities of some kind or other. When the government, or those\r\n      who acted under them, contracted with a merchant for a remittance to some\r\n      foreign country, he would naturally endeavour to pay his foreign\r\n      correspondent, upon whom he granted a bill, by sending abroad rather\r\n      commodities than gold and silver. If the commodities of Great Britain were\r\n      not in demand in that country, he would endeavour to send them to some\r\n      other country in which he could purchase a bill upon that country. The\r\n      transportation of commodities, when properly suited to the market, is\r\n      always attended with a considerable profit; whereas that of gold and\r\n      silver is scarce ever attended with any. When those metals are sent abroad\r\n      in order to purchase foreign commodities, the merchant’s profit arises,\r\n      not from the purchase, but from the sale of the returns. But when they are\r\n      sent abroad merely to pay a debt, he gets no returns, and consequently no\r\n      profit. He naturally, therefore, exerts his invention to find out a way of\r\n      paying his foreign debts, rather by the exportation of commodities, than\r\n      by that of gold and silver. The great quantity of British goods, exported\r\n      during the course of the late war, without bringing back any returns, is\r\n      accordingly remarked by the author of the Present State of the Nation.\r\n\r\n      Besides the three sorts of gold and silver above mentioned, there is in\r\n      all great commercial countries a good deal of bullion alternately imported\r\n      and exported, for the purposes of foreign trade. This bullion, as it\r\n      circulates among different commercial countries, in the same manner as the\r\n      national coin circulates in every country, may be considered as the money\r\n      of the great mercantile republic. The national coin receives its movement\r\n      and direction from the commodities circulated within the precincts of each\r\n      particular country; the money in the mercantile republic, from those\r\n      circulated between different countries. Both are employed in facilitating\r\n      exchanges, the one between different individuals of the same, the other\r\n      between those of different nations. Part of this money of the great\r\n      mercantile republic may have been, and probably was, employed in carrying\r\n      on the late war. In time of a general war, it is natural to suppose that a\r\n      movement and direction should be impressed upon it, different from what it\r\n      usually follows in profound peace, that it should circulate more about the\r\n      seat of the war, and be more employed in purchasing there, and in the\r\n      neighbouring countries, the pay and provisions of the different armies.\r\n      But whatever part of this money of the mercantile republic Great Britain\r\n      may have annually employed in this manner, it must have been annually\r\n      purchased, either with British commodities, or with something else that\r\n      had been purchased with them; which still brings us back to commodities,\r\n      to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, as the\r\n      ultimate resources which enabled us to carry on the war. It is natural,\r\n      indeed, to suppose, that so great an annual expense must have been\r\n      defrayed from a great annual produce. The expense of 1761, for example,\r\n      amounted to more than £19,000,000. No accumulation could have supported so\r\n      great an annual profusion. There is no annual produce, even of gold and\r\n      silver, which could have supported it. The whole gold and silver annually\r\n      imported into both Spain and Portugal, according to the best accounts,\r\n      does not commonly much exceed £6,000,000 sterling, which, in some years,\r\n      would scarce have paid four months expense of the late war.\r\n\r\n      The commodities most proper for being transported to distant countries, in\r\n      order to purchase there either the pay and provisions of an army, or some\r\n      part of the money of the mercantile republic to be employed in purchasing\r\n      them, seem to be the finer and more improved manufactures; such as contain\r\n      a great value in a small bulk, and can therefore be exported to a great\r\n      distance at little expense. A country whose industry produces a great\r\n      annual surplus of such manufactures, which are usually exported to foreign\r\n      countries, may carry on for many years a very expensive foreign war,\r\n      without either exporting any considerable quantity of gold and silver, or\r\n      even having any such quantity to export. A considerable part of the annual\r\n      surplus of its manufactures must, indeed, in this case, be exported\r\n      without bringing back any returns to the country, though it does to the\r\n      merchant; the government purchasing of the merchant his bills upon foreign\r\n      countries, in order to purchase there the pay and provisions of an army.\r\n      Some part of this surplus, however, may still continue to bring back a\r\n      return. The manufacturers during; the war will have a double demand upon\r\n      them, and be called upon first to work up goods to be sent abroad, for\r\n      paying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provisions\r\n      of the army: and, secondly, to work up such as are necessary for\r\n      purchasing the common returns that had usually been consumed in the\r\n      country. In the midst of the most destructive foreign war, therefore, the\r\n      greater part of manufactures may frequently flourish greatly; and, on the\r\n      contrary, they may decline on the return of peace. They may flourish\r\n      amidst the ruin of their country, and begin to decay upon the return of\r\n      its prosperity. The different state of many different branches of the\r\n      British manufactures during the late war, and for some time after the\r\n      peace, may serve as an illustration of what has been just now said.\r\n\r\n      No foreign war, of great expense or duration, could conveniently be\r\n      carried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the soil. The expense\r\n      of sending such a quantity of it into a foreign country as might purchase\r\n      the pay and provisions of an army would be too great. Few countries, too,\r\n      produce much more rude produce than what is sufficient for the subsistence\r\n      of their own inhabitants. To send abroad any great quantity of it,\r\n      therefore, would be to send abroad a part of the necessary subsistence of\r\n      the people. It is otherwise with the exportation of manufactures. The\r\n      maintenance of the people employed in them is kept at home, and only the\r\n      surplus part of their work is exported. Mr Hume frequently takes notice of\r\n      the inability of the ancient kings of England to carry on, without\r\n      interruption, any foreign war of long duration. The English in those days\r\n      had nothing wherewithal to purchase the pay and provisions of their armies\r\n      in foreign countries, but either the rude produce of the soil, of which no\r\n      considerable part could be spared from the home consumption, or a few\r\n      manufactures of the coarsest kind, of which, as well as of the rude\r\n      produce, the transportation was too expensive. This inability did not\r\n      arise from the want of money, but of the finer and more improved\r\n      manufactures. Buying and selling was transacted by means of money in\r\n      England then as well as now. The quantity of circulating money must have\r\n      borne the same proportion, to the number and value of purchases and sales\r\n      usually transacted at that time, which it does to those transacted at\r\n      present; or, rather, it must have borne a greater proportion, because\r\n      there was then no paper, which now occupies a great part of the employment\r\n      of gold and silver. Among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are\r\n      little known, the sovereign, upon extraordinary occasions, can seldom draw\r\n      any considerable aid from his subjects, for reasons which shall be\r\n      explained hereafter. It is in such countries, therefore, that he generally\r\n      endeavours to accumulate a treasure, as the only resource against such\r\n      emergencies. Independent of this necessity, he is, in such a situation,\r\n      naturally disposed to the parsimony requisite for accumulation. In that\r\n      simple state, the expense even of a sovereign is not directed by the\r\n      vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court, but is employed in\r\n      bounty to his tenants, and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and\r\n      hospitality very seldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost always\r\n      does. Every Tartar chief, accordingly, has a treasure. The treasures of\r\n      Mazepa, chief of the Cossacks in the Ukraine, the famous ally of Charles\r\n      XII., are said to have been very great. The French kings of the\r\n      Merovingian race had all treasures. When they divided their kingdom among\r\n      their different children, they divided their treasures too. The Saxon\r\n      princes, and the first kings after the Conquest, seem likewise to have\r\n      accumulated treasures. The first exploit of every new reign was commonly\r\n      to seize the treasure of the preceding king, as the most essential measure\r\n      for securing the succession. The sovereigns of improved and commercial\r\n      countries are not under the same necessity of accumulating treasures,\r\n      because they can generally draw from their subjects extraordinary aids\r\n      upon extraordinary occasions. They are likewise less disposed to do so.\r\n      They naturally, perhaps necessarily, follow the mode of the times; and\r\n      their expense comes to be regulated by the same extravagant vanity which\r\n      directs that of all the other great proprietors in their dominions. The\r\n      insignificant pageantry of their court becomes every day more brilliant;\r\n      and the expense of it not only prevents accumulation, but frequently\r\n      encroaches upon the funds destined for more necessary expenses. What\r\n      Dercyllidas said of the court of Persia, may be applied to that of several\r\n      European princes, that he saw there much splendour, but little strength,\r\n      and many servants, but few soldiers.\r\n\r\n      The importation of gold and silver is not the principal, much less the\r\n      sole benefit, which a nation derives from its foreign trade. Between\r\n      whatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two\r\n      distinct benefits from it. It carries out that surplus part of the produce\r\n      of their land and labour for which there is no demand among them, and\r\n      brings back in return for it something else for which there is a demand.\r\n      It gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them for something\r\n      else, which may satisfy a part of their wants and increase their\r\n      enjoyments. By means of it, the narrowness of the home market does not\r\n      hinder the division of labour in any particular branch of art or\r\n      manufacture from being carried to the highest perfection. By opening a\r\n      more extensive market for whatever part of the produce of their labour may\r\n      exceed the home consumption, it encourages them to improve its productive\r\n      power, and to augment its annual produce to the utmost, and thereby to\r\n      increase the real revenue and wealth of the society. These great and\r\n      important services foreign trade is continually occupied in performing to\r\n      all the different countries between which it is carried on. They all\r\n      derive great benefit from it, though that in which the merchant resides\r\n      generally derives the greatest, as he is generally more employed in\r\n      supplying the wants, and carrying out the superfluities of his own, than\r\n      of any other particular country. To import the gold and silver which may\r\n      be wanted into the countries which have no mines, is, no doubt a part of\r\n      the business of foreign commerce. It is, however, a most insignificant\r\n      part of it. A country which carried on foreign trade merely upon this\r\n      account, could scarce have occasion to freight a ship in a century.\r\n\r\n      It is not by the importation of gold and silver that the discovery of\r\n      America has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines, those\r\n      metals have become cheaper. A service of plate can now be purchased for\r\n      about a third part of the corn, or a third part of the labour, which it\r\n      would have cost in the fifteenth century. With the same annual expense of\r\n      labour and commodities, Europe can annually purchase about three times the\r\n      quantity of plate which it could have purchased at that time. But when a\r\n      commodity comes to be sold for a third part of what bad been its usual\r\n      price, not only those who purchased it before can purchase three times\r\n      their former quantity, but it is brought down to the level of a much\r\n      greater number of purchasers, perhaps to more than ten, perhaps to more\r\n      than twenty times the former number. So that there may be in Europe at\r\n      present, not only more than three times, but more than twenty or thirty\r\n      times the quantity of plate which would have been in it, even in its\r\n      present state of improvement, had the discovery of the American mines\r\n      never been made. So far Europe has, no doubt, gained a real conveniency,\r\n      though surely a very trifling one. The cheapness of gold and silver\r\n      renders those metals rather less fit for the purposes of money than they\r\n      were before. In order to make the same purchases, we must load ourselves\r\n      with a greater quantity of them, and carry about a shilling in our pocket,\r\n      where a groat would have done before. It is difficult to say which is most\r\n      trifling, this inconveniency, or the opposite conveniency. Neither the one\r\n      nor the other could have made any very essential change in the state of\r\n      Europe. The discovery of America, however, certainly made a most essential\r\n      one. By opening a new and inexhaustible market to all the commodities of\r\n      Europe, it gave occasion to new divisions of labour and improvements of\r\n      art, which in the narrow circle of the ancient commerce could never have\r\n      taken place, for want of a market to take off the greater part of their\r\n      produce. The productive powers of labour were improved, and its produce\r\n      increased in all the different countries of Europe, and together with it\r\n      the real revenue and wealth of the inhabitants. The commodities of Europe\r\n      were almost all new to America, and many of those of America were new to\r\n      Europe. A new set of exchanges, therefore, began to take place, which had\r\n      never been thought of before, and which should naturally have proved as\r\n      advantageous to the new, as it certainly did to the old continent. The\r\n      savage injustice of the Europeans rendered an event, which ought to have\r\n      been beneficial to all, ruinous and destructive to several of those\r\n      unfortunate countries.\r\n\r\n      The discovery of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope,\r\n      which happened much about the same time, opened perhaps a still more\r\n      extensive range to foreign commerce, than even that of America,\r\n      notwithstanding the greater distance. There were but two nations in\r\n      America, in any respect, superior to the savages, and these were destroyed\r\n      almost as soon as discovered. The rest were mere savages. But the empires\r\n      of China, Indostan, Japan, as well as several others in the East Indies,\r\n      without having richer mines of gold or silver, were, in every other\r\n      respect, much richer, better cultivated, and more advanced in all arts and\r\n      manufactures, than either Mexico or Peru, even though we should credit,\r\n      what plainly deserves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the Spanish\r\n      writers concerning the ancient state of those empires. But rich and\r\n      civilized nations can always exchange to a much greater value with one\r\n      another, than with savages and barbarians. Europe, however, has hitherto\r\n      derived much less advantage from its commerce with the East Indies, than\r\n      from that with America. The Portuguese monopolised the East India trade to\r\n      themselves for about a century; and it was only indirectly, and through\r\n      them, that the other nations of Europe could either send out or receive\r\n      any goods from that country. When the Dutch, in the beginning of the last\r\n      century, began to encroach upon them, they vested their whole East India\r\n      commerce in an exclusive company. The English, French, Swedes, and Danes,\r\n      have all followed their example; so that no great nation of Europe has\r\n      ever yet had the benefit of a free commerce to the East Indies. No other\r\n      reason need be assigned why it has never been so advantageous as the trade\r\n      to America, which, between almost every nation of Europe and its own\r\n      colonies, is free to all its subjects. The exclusive privileges of those\r\n      East India companies, their great riches, the great favour and protection\r\n      which these have procured them from their respective governments, have\r\n      excited much envy against them. This envy has frequently represented their\r\n      trade as altogether pernicious, on account of the great quantities of\r\n      silver which it every year exports from the countries from which it is\r\n      carried on. The parties concerned have replied, that their trade by this\r\n      continual exportation of silver, might indeed tend to impoverish Europe in\r\n      general, but not the particular country from which it was carried on;\r\n      because, by the exportation of a part of the returns to other European\r\n      countries, it annually brought home a much greater quantity of that metal\r\n      than it carried out. Both the objection and the reply are founded in the\r\n      popular notion which I have been just now examining. It is therefore\r\n      unnecessary to say any thing further about either. By the annual\r\n      exportation of silver to the East Indies, plate is probably somewhat\r\n      dearer in Europe than it otherwise might have been; and coined silver\r\n      probably purchases a larger quantity both of labour and commodities. The\r\n      former of these two effects is a very small loss, the latter a very small\r\n      advantage; both too insignificant to deserve any part of the public\r\n      attention. The trade to the East Indies, by opening a market to the\r\n      commodities of Europe, or, what comes nearly to the same thing, to the\r\n      gold and silver which is purchased with those commodities, must\r\n      necessarily tend to increase the annual production of European\r\n      commodities, and consequently the real wealth and revenue of Europe. That\r\n      it has hitherto increased them so little, is probably owing to the\r\n      restraints which it everywhere labours under.\r\n\r\n      I thought it necessary, though at the hazard of being tedious, to examine\r\n      at full length this popular notion, that wealth consists in money or in\r\n      gold and silver. Money, in common language, as I have already observed,\r\n      frequently signifies wealth; and this ambiguity of expression has rendered\r\n      this popular notion so familiar to us, that even they who are convinced of\r\n      its absurdity, are very apt to forget their own principles, and, in the\r\n      course of their reasonings, to take it for granted as a certain and\r\n      undeniable truth. Some of the best English writers upon commerce set out\r\n      with observing, that the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and\r\n      silver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all\r\n      different kinds. In the course of their reasonings, however, the lands,\r\n      houses, and consumable goods, seem to slip out of their memory; and the\r\n      strain of their argument frequently supposes that all wealth consists in\r\n      gold and silver, and that to multiply those metals is the great object of\r\n      national industry and commerce.\r\n\r\n      The two principles being established, however, that wealth consisted in\r\n      gold and silver, and that those metals could be brought into a country\r\n      which had no mines, only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to a\r\n      greater value than it imported; it necessarily became the great object of\r\n      political economy to diminish as much as possible the importation of\r\n      foreign goods for home consumption, and to increase as much as possible\r\n      the exportation of the produce of domestic industry. Its two great engines\r\n      for enriching the country, therefore, were restraints upon importation,\r\n      and encouragement to exportation.\r\n\r\n      The restraints upon importation were of two kinds.\r\n\r\n      First, restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for home\r\n      consumption as could be produced at home, from whatever country they were\r\n      imported.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds,\r\n      from those particular countries with which the balance of trade was\r\n      supposed to be disadvantageous.\r\n\r\n      Those different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties, and\r\n      sometimes in absolute prohibitions.\r\n\r\n      Exportation was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks, sometimes by bounties,\r\n      sometimes by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign states, and\r\n      sometimes by the establishment of colonies in distant countries.\r\n\r\n      Drawbacks were given upon two different occasions. When the home\r\n      manufactures were subject to any duty or excise, either the whole or a\r\n      part of it was frequently drawn back upon their exportation; and when\r\n      foreign goods liable to a duty were imported, in order to be exported\r\n      again, either the whole or a part of this duty was sometimes given back\r\n      upon such exportation.\r\n\r\n      Bounties were given for the encouragement, either of some beginning\r\n      manufactures, or of such sorts of industry of other kinds as were supposed\r\n      to deserve particular favour.\r\n\r\n      By advantageous treaties of commerce, particular privileges were procured\r\n      in some foreign state for the goods and merchants of the country, beyond\r\n      what were granted to those of other countries.\r\n\r\n      By the establishment of colonies in distant countries, not only particular\r\n      privileges, but a monopoly was frequently procured for the goods and\r\n      merchants of the country which established them.\r\n\r\n      The two sorts of restraints upon importation above mentioned, together\r\n      with these four encouragements to exportation, constitute the six\r\n      principal means by which the commercial system proposes to increase the\r\n      quantity of gold and silver in any country, by turning the balance of\r\n      trade in its favour. I shall consider each of them in a particular\r\n      chapter, and, without taking much farther notice of their supposed\r\n      tendency to bring money into the country, I shall examine chiefly what are\r\n      likely to be the effects of each of them upon the annual produce of its\r\n      industry. According as they tend either to increase or diminish the value\r\n      of this annual produce, they must evidently tend either to increase or\r\n      diminish the real wealth and revenue of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nOF RESTRAINTS UPON IMPORTATION FROM\r\nFOREIGN COUNTRIES OF SUCH GOODS AS CAN BE PRODUCED AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      By restraining, either by high duties, or by absolute prohibitions, the\r\n      importation of such goods from foreign countries as can be produced at\r\n      home, the monopoly of the home market is more or less secured to the\r\n      domestic industry employed in producing them. Thus the prohibition of\r\n      importing either live cattle or salt provisions from foreign countries,\r\n      secures to the graziers of Great Britain the monopoly of the home market\r\n      for butcher’s meat. The high duties upon the importation of corn, which,\r\n      in times of moderate plenty, amount to a prohibition, give a like\r\n      advantage to the growers of that commodity. The prohibition of the\r\n      importation of foreign woollen is equally favourable to the woollen\r\n      manufacturers. The silk manufacture, though altogether employed upon\r\n      foreign materials, has lately obtained the same advantage. The linen\r\n      manufacture has not yet obtained it, but is making great strides towards\r\n      it. Many other sorts of manufactures have, in the same manner obtained in\r\n      Great Britain, either altogether, or very nearly, a monopoly against their\r\n      countrymen. The variety of goods, of which the importation into Great\r\n      Britain is prohibited, either absolutely, or under certain circumstances,\r\n      greatly exceeds what can easily be suspected by those who are not well\r\n      acquainted with the laws of the customs.\r\n\r\n      That this monopoly of the home market frequently gives great encouragement\r\n      to that particular species of industry which enjoys it, and frequently\r\n      turns towards that employment a greater share of both the labour and stock\r\n      of the society than would otherwise have gone to it, cannot be doubted.\r\n      But whether it tends either to increase the general industry of the\r\n      society, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps,\r\n      altogether so evident.\r\n\r\n      The general industry of the society can never exceed what the capital of\r\n      the society can employ. As the number of workmen that can be kept in\r\n      employment by any particular person must bear a certain proportion to his\r\n      capital, so the number of those that can be continually employed by all\r\n      the members of a great society must bear a certain proportion to the whole\r\n      capital of the society, and never can exceed that proportion. No\r\n      regulation of commerce can increase the quantity of industry in any\r\n      society beyond what its capital can maintain. It can only divert a part of\r\n      it into a direction into which it might not otherwise have gone; and it is\r\n      by no means certain that this artificial direction is likely to be more\r\n      advantageous to the society, than that into which it would have gone of\r\n      its own accord.\r\n\r\n      Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most\r\n      advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own\r\n      advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view. But\r\n      the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads him\r\n      to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society.\r\n\r\n      First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as\r\n      he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic\r\n      industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not\r\n      a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock.\r\n\r\n      Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant\r\n      naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and\r\n      the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade,\r\n      his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the\r\n      foreign trade of consumption. He can know better the character and\r\n      situation of the persons whom he trusts; and if he should happen to be\r\n      deceived, he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek\r\n      redress. In the carrying trade, the capital of the merchant is, as it\r\n      were, divided between two foreign countries, and no part of it is ever\r\n      necessarily brought home, or placed under his own immediate view and\r\n      command. The capital which an Amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn\r\n      from Koningsberg to Lisbon, and fruit and wine from Lisbon to Koningsberg,\r\n      must generally be the one half of it at Koningsberg, and the other half at\r\n      Lisbon. No part of it need ever come to Amsterdam. The natural residence\r\n      of such a merchant should either be at Koningsberg or Lisbon; and it can\r\n      only be some very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the\r\n      residence of Amsterdam. The uneasiness, however, which he feels at being\r\n      separated so far from his capital, generally determines him to bring part\r\n      both of the Koningsberg goods which he destines for the market of Lisbon,\r\n      and of the Lisbon goods which he destines for that of Koningsberg, to\r\n      Amsterdam; and though this necessarily subjects him to a double charge of\r\n      loading and unloading as well as to the payment of some duties and\r\n      customs, yet, for the sake of having some part of his capital always under\r\n      his own view and command, he willingly submits to this extraordinary\r\n      charge; and it is in this manner that every country which has any\r\n      considerable share of the carrying trade, becomes always the emporium, or\r\n      general market, for the goods of all the different countries whose trade\r\n      it carries on. The merchant, in order to save a second loading and\r\n      unloading, endeavours always to sell in the home market, as much of the\r\n      goods of all those different countries as he can; and thus, so far as he\r\n      can, to convert his carrying trade into a foreign trade of consumption. A\r\n      merchant, in the same manner, who is engaged in the foreign trade of\r\n      consumption, when he collects goods for foreign markets, will always be\r\n      glad, upon equal or nearly equal profits, to sell as great a part of them\r\n      at home as he can. He saves himself the risk and trouble of exportation,\r\n      when, so far as he can, he thus converts his foreign trade of consumption\r\n      into a home trade. Home is in this manner the centre, if I may say so,\r\n      round which the capitals of the inhabitants of every country are\r\n      continually circulating, and towards which they are always tending,\r\n      though, by particular causes, they may sometimes be driven off and\r\n      repelled from it towards more distant employments. But a capital employed\r\n      in the home trade, it has already been shown, necessarily puts into motion\r\n      a greater quantity of domestic industry, and gives revenue and employment\r\n      to a greater number of the inhabitants of the country, than an equal\r\n      capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption; and one employed in\r\n      the foreign trade of consumption has the same advantage over an equal\r\n      capital employed in the carrying trade. Upon equal, or only nearly equal\r\n      profits, therefore, every individual naturally inclines to employ his\r\n      capital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greatest support\r\n      to domestic industry, and to give revenue and employment to the greatest\r\n      number of people of his own country.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of\r\n      domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that\r\n      its produce may be of the greatest possible value.\r\n\r\n      The produce of industry is what it adds to the subject or materials upon\r\n      which it is employed. In proportion as the value of this produce is great\r\n      or small, so will likewise be the profits of the employer. But it is only\r\n      for the sake of profit that any man employs a capital in the support of\r\n      industry; and he will always, therefore, endeavour to employ it in the\r\n      support of that industry of which the produce is likely to be of the\r\n      greatest value, or to exchange for the greatest quantity either of money\r\n      or of other goods.\r\n\r\n      But the annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the\r\n      exchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry, or rather\r\n      is precisely the same thing with that exchangeable value. As every\r\n      individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his\r\n      capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that\r\n      industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual\r\n      necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great\r\n      as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public\r\n      interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support\r\n      of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security;\r\n      and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of\r\n      the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in\r\n      many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no\r\n      part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it\r\n      was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes\r\n      that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to\r\n      promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to\r\n      trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common\r\n      among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them\r\n      from it.\r\n\r\n      What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and\r\n      of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every\r\n      individual, it is evident, can in his local situation judge much better\r\n      than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. The statesman, who should\r\n      attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their\r\n      capitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention,\r\n      but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no\r\n      single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would\r\n      nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and\r\n      presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.\r\n\r\n      To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic\r\n      industry, in any particular art or manufacture, is in some measure to\r\n      direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals,\r\n      and must in almost all cases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation.\r\n      If the produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of\r\n      foreign industry, the regulation is evidently useless. If it cannot, it\r\n      must generally be hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent master of a\r\n      family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to\r\n      make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but\r\n      buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own\r\n      clothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one\r\n      nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it\r\n      for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they\r\n      have some advantage over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of\r\n      its produce, or, what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it,\r\n      whatever else they have occasion for.\r\n\r\n      What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be\r\n      folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with\r\n      a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them\r\n      with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in\r\n      which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country being\r\n      always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be\r\n      diminished, no more than that of the abovementioned artificers; but only\r\n      left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest\r\n      advantage. It is certainly not employed to the greatest advantage, when it\r\n      is thus directed towards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can\r\n      make. The value of its annual produce is certainly more or less\r\n      diminished, when it is thus turned away from producing commodities\r\n      evidently of more value than the commodity which it is directed to\r\n      produce. According to the supposition, that commodity could be purchased\r\n      from foreign countries cheaper than it can be made at home; it could\r\n      therefore have been purchased with a part only of the commodities, or,\r\n      what is the same thing, with a part only of the price of the commodities,\r\n      which the industry employed by an equal capital would have produced at\r\n      home, had it been left to follow its natural course. The industry of the\r\n      country, therefore, is thus turned away from a more to a less advantageous\r\n      employment; and the exchangeable value of its annual produce, instead of\r\n      being increased, according to the intention of the lawgiver, must\r\n      necessarily be diminished by every such regulation.\r\n\r\n      By means of such regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may\r\n      sometimes be acquired sooner than it could have been otherwise, and after\r\n      a certain time may be made at home as cheap, or cheaper, than in the\r\n      foreign country. But though the industry of the society may be thus\r\n      carried with advantage into a particular channel sooner than it could have\r\n      been otherwise, it will by no means follow that the sum-total, either of\r\n      its industry, or of its revenue, can ever be augmented by any such\r\n      regulation. The industry of the society can augment only in proportion as\r\n      its capital augments, and its capital can augment only in proportion to\r\n      what can be gradually saved out of its revenue. But the immediate effect\r\n      of every such regulation is to diminish its revenue; and what diminishes\r\n      its revenue is certainly not very likely to augment its capital faster\r\n      than it would have augmented of its own accord, had both capital and\r\n      industry been left to find out their natural employments.\r\n\r\n      Though, for want of such regulations, the society should never acquire the\r\n      proposed manufacture, it would not upon that account necessarily be the\r\n      poorer in anyone period of its duration. In every period of its duration\r\n      its whole capital and industry might still have been employed, though upon\r\n      different objects, in the manner that was most advantageous at the time.\r\n      In every period its revenue might have been the greatest which its capital\r\n      could afford, and both capital and revenue might have been augmented with\r\n      the greatest possible rapidity.\r\n\r\n      The natural advantages which one country has over another, in producing\r\n      particular commodities, are sometimes so great, that it is acknowledged by\r\n      all the world to be in vain to struggle with them. By means of glasses,\r\n      hot-beds, and hot-walls, very good grapes can be raised in Scotland, and\r\n      very good wine, too, can be made of them, at about thirty times the\r\n      expense for which at least equally good can be brought from foreign\r\n      countries. Would it be a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all\r\n      foreign wines, merely to encourage the making of claret and Burgundy in\r\n      Scotland? But if there would be a manifest absurdity in turning towards\r\n      any employment thirty times more of the capital and industry of the\r\n      country than would be necessary to purchase from foreign countries an\r\n      equal quantity of the commodities wanted, there must be an absurdity,\r\n      though not altogether so glaring, yet exactly of the same kind, in turning\r\n      towards any such employment a thirtieth, or even a three hundredth part\r\n      more of either. Whether the advantages which one country has over another\r\n      be natural or acquired, is in this respect of no consequence. As long as\r\n      the one country has those advantages, and the other wants them, it will\r\n      always be more advantageous for the latter rather to buy of the former\r\n      than to make. It is an acquired advantage only, which one artificer has\r\n      over his neighbour, who exercises another trade; and yet they both find it\r\n      more advantageous to buy of one another, than to make what does not belong\r\n      to their particular trades.\r\n\r\n      Merchants and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest\r\n      advantage from this monopoly of the home market. The prohibition of the\r\n      importation of foreign cattle and of salt provisions, together with the\r\n      high duties upon foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to\r\n      a prohibition, are not near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of\r\n      Great Britain, as other regulations of the same kind are to its merchants\r\n      and manufacturers. Manufactures, those of the finer kind especially, are\r\n      more easily transported from one country to another than corn or cattle.\r\n      It is in the fetching and carrying manufactures, accordingly, that foreign\r\n      trade is chiefly employed. In manufactures, a very small advantage will\r\n      enable foreigners to undersell our own workmen, even in the home market.\r\n      It will require a very great one to enable them to do so in the rude\r\n      produce of the soil. If the free importation of foreign manufactures were\r\n      permitted, several of the home manufactures would probably suffer, and\r\n      some of them perhaps go to ruin altogether, and a considerable part of the\r\n      stock and industry at present employed in them, would be forced to find\r\n      out some other employment. But the freest importation of the rude produce\r\n      of the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of the country.\r\n\r\n      If the importation of foreign cattle, for example, were made ever so free,\r\n      so few could be imported, that the grazing trade of Great Britain could be\r\n      little affected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity of\r\n      which the transportation is more expensive by sea than by land. By land\r\n      they carry themselves to market. By sea, not only the cattle, but their\r\n      food and their water too, must be carried at no small expense and\r\n      inconveniency. The short sea between Ireland and Great Britain, indeed,\r\n      renders the importation of Irish cattle more easy. But though the free\r\n      importation of them, which was lately permitted only for a limited time,\r\n      were rendered perpetual, it could have no considerable effect upon the\r\n      interest of the graziers of Great Britain. Those parts of Great Britain\r\n      which border upon the Irish sea are all grazing countries. Irish cattle\r\n      could never be imported for their use, but must be drove through those\r\n      very extensive countries, at no small expense and inconveniency, before\r\n      they could arrive at their proper market. Fat cattle could not be drove so\r\n      far. Lean cattle, therefore, could only be imported; and such importation\r\n      could interfere not with the interest of the feeding or fattening\r\n      countries, to which, by reducing the price of lean cattle it would rather\r\n      be advantageous, but with that of the breeding countries only. The small\r\n      number of Irish cattle imported since their importation was permitted,\r\n      together with the good price at which lean cattle still continue to sell,\r\n      seem to demonstrate, that even the breeding countries of Great Britain are\r\n      never likely to be much affected by the free importation of Irish cattle.\r\n      The common people of Ireland, indeed, are said to have sometimes opposed\r\n      with violence the exportation of their cattle. But if the exporters had\r\n      found any great advantage in continuing the trade, they could easily, when\r\n      the law was on their side, have conquered this mobbish opposition.\r\n\r\n      Feeding and fattening countries, besides, must always be highly improved,\r\n      whereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated. The high price of\r\n      lean cattle, by augmenting the value of uncultivated land, is like a\r\n      bounty against improvement. To any country which was highly improved\r\n      throughout, it would be more advantageous to import its lean cattle than\r\n      to breed them. The province of Holland, accordingly, is said to follow\r\n      this maxim at present. The mountains of Scotland, Wales, and\r\n      Northumberland, indeed, are countries not capable of much improvement, and\r\n      seem destined by nature to be the breeding countries of Great Britain. The\r\n      freest importation of foreign cattle could have no other effect than to\r\n      hinder those breeding countries from taking advantage of the increasing\r\n      population and improvement of the rest of the kingdom, from raising their\r\n      price to an exorbitant height, and from laying a real tax upon all the\r\n      more improved and cultivated parts of the country.\r\n\r\n      The freest importation of salt provisions, in the same manner, could have\r\n      as little effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great Britain as\r\n      that of live cattle. Salt provisions are not only a very bulky commodity,\r\n      but when compared with fresh meat they are a commodity both of worse\r\n      quality, and, as they cost more labour and expense, of higher price. They\r\n      could never, therefore, come into competition with the fresh meat, though\r\n      they might with the salt provisions of the country. They might be used for\r\n      victualling ships for distant voyages, and such like uses, but could never\r\n      make any considerable part of the food of the people. The small quantity\r\n      of salt provisions imported from Ireland since their importation was\r\n      rendered free, is an experimental proof that our graziers have nothing to\r\n      apprehend from it. It does not appear that the price of butcher’s meat has\r\n      ever been sensibly affected by it.\r\n\r\n      Even the free importation of foreign corn could very little affect the\r\n      interest of the farmers of Great Britain. Corn is a much more bulky\r\n      commodity than butcher’s meat. A pound of wheat at a penny is as dear as a\r\n      pound of butcher’s meat at fourpence. The small quantity of foreign corn\r\n      imported even in times of the greatest scarcity, may satisfy our farmers\r\n      that they can have nothing to fear from the freest importation. The\r\n      average quantity imported, one year with another, amounts only, according\r\n      to the very well informed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, to\r\n      23,728 quarters of all sorts of grain, and does not exceed the five\r\n      hundredth and seventy-one part of the annual consumption. But as the\r\n      bounty upon corn occasions a greater exportation in years of plenty, so it\r\n      must, of consequence, occasion a greater importation in years of scarcity,\r\n      than in the actual state of tillage would otherwise take place. By means\r\n      of it, the plenty of one year does not compensate the scarcity of another;\r\n      and as the average quantity exported is necessarily augmented by it, so\r\n      must likewise, in the actual state of tillage, the average quantity\r\n      imported. If there were no bounty, as less corn would be exported, so it\r\n      is probable that, one year with another, less would be imported than at\r\n      present. The corn-merchants, the fetchers and carriers of corn between\r\n      Great Britain and foreign countries, would have much less employment, and\r\n      might suffer considerably; but the country gentlemen and farmers could\r\n      suffer very little. It is in the corn-merchants, accordingly, rather than\r\n      the country gentlemen and farmers, that I have observed the greatest\r\n      anxiety for the renewal and continuation of the bounty.\r\n\r\n      Country gentlemen and farmers are, to their great honour, of all people,\r\n      the least subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a\r\n      great manufactory is sometimes alarmed if another work of the same kind is\r\n      established within twenty miles of him; the Dutch undertaker of the\r\n      woollen manufacture at Abbeville, stipulated that no work of the same kind\r\n      should be established within thirty leagues of that city. Farmers and\r\n      country gentlemen, on the contrary, are generally disposed rather to\r\n      promote, than to obstruct, the cultivation and improvement of their\r\n      neighbours farms and estates. They have no secrets, such as those of the\r\n      greater part of manufacturers, but are generally rather fond of\r\n      communicating to their neighbours, and of extending as far as possible any\r\n      new practice which they may have found to be advantageous. “Pius\r\n      quaestus”, says old Cato, “stabilissimusque, minimeque invidiosus;\r\n      minimeque male cogitantes sunt, qui in eo studio occupati sunt.” Country\r\n      gentlemen and farmers, dispersed in different parts of the country, cannot\r\n      so easily combine as merchants and manufacturers, who being collected into\r\n      towns, and accustomed to that exclusive corporation spirit which prevails\r\n      in them, naturally endeavour to obtain, against all their countrymen, the\r\n      same exclusive privilege which they generally possess against the\r\n      inhabitants of their respective towns. They accordingly seem to have been\r\n      the original inventors of those restraints upon the importation of foreign\r\n      goods, which secure to them the monopoly of the home market. It was\r\n      probably in imitation of them, and to put themselves upon a level with\r\n      those who, they found, were disposed to oppress them, that the country\r\n      gentlemen and farmers of Great Britain so far forgot the generosity which\r\n      is natural to their station, as to demand the exclusive privilege of\r\n      supplying their countrymen with corn and butcher’s meat. They did not,\r\n      perhaps, take time to consider how much less their interest could be\r\n      affected by the freedom of trade, than that of the people whose example\r\n      they followed.\r\n\r\n      To prohibit, by a perpetual law, the importation of foreign corn and\r\n      cattle, is in reality to enact, that the population and industry of the\r\n      country shall, at no time, exceed what the rude produce of its own soil\r\n      can maintain.\r\n\r\n      There seem, however, to be two cases, in which it will generally be\r\n      advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of\r\n      domestic industry.\r\n\r\n      The first is, when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the\r\n      defence of the country. The defence of Great Britain, for example, depends\r\n      very much upon the number of its sailors and shipping. The act of\r\n      navigation, therefore, very properly endeavours to give the sailors and\r\n      shipping of Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country,\r\n      in some cases, by absolute prohibitions, and in others, by heavy burdens\r\n      upon the shipping of foreign countries. The following are the principal\r\n      dispositions of this act.\r\n\r\n      First, All ships, of which the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the\r\n      mariners, are not British subjects, are prohibited, upon pain of\r\n      forfeiting ship and cargo, from trading to the British settlements and\r\n      plantations, or from being employed in the coasting trade of Great\r\n      Britain.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, A great variety of the most bulky articles of importation can be\r\n      brought into Great Britain only, either in such ships as are above\r\n      described, or in ships of the country where those goods are produced, and\r\n      of which the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the mariners, are of\r\n      that particular country; and when imported even in ships of this latter\r\n      kind, they are subject to double aliens duty. If imported in ships of any\r\n      other country, the penalty is forfeiture of ship and goods. When this act\r\n      was made, the Dutch were, what they still are, the great carriers of\r\n      Europe; and by this regulation they were entirely excluded from being the\r\n      carriers to Great Britain, or from importing to us the goods of any other\r\n      European country.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, A great variety of the most bulky articles of importation are\r\n      prohibited from being imported, even in British ships, from any country\r\n      but that in which they are produced, under pain of forfeiting ship and\r\n      cargo. This regulation, too, was probably intended against the Dutch.\r\n      Holland was then, as now, the great emporium for all European goods; and\r\n      by this regulation, British ships were hindered from loading in Holland\r\n      the goods of any other European country.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, Salt fish of all kinds, whale fins, whalebone, oil, and blubber,\r\n      not caught by and cured on board British vessels, when imported into Great\r\n      Britain, are subject to double aliens duty. The Dutch, as they are still\r\n      the principal, were then the only fishers in Europe that attempted to\r\n      supply foreign nations with fish. By this regulation, a very heavy burden\r\n      was laid upon their supplying Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      When the act of navigation was made, though England and Holland were not\r\n      actually at war, the most violent animosity subsisted between the two\r\n      nations. It had begun during the government of the long parliament, which\r\n      first framed this act, and it broke out soon after in the Dutch wars,\r\n      during that of the Protector and of Charles II. It is not impossible,\r\n      therefore, that some of the regulations of this famous act may have\r\n      proceeded from national animosity. They are as wise, however, as if they\r\n      had all been dictated by the most deliberate wisdom. National animosity,\r\n      at that particular time, aimed at the very same object which the most\r\n      deliberate wisdom would have recommended, the diminution of the naval\r\n      power of Holland, the only naval power which could endanger the security\r\n      of England.\r\n\r\n      The act of navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to the\r\n      growth of that opulence which can arise from it. The interest of a nation,\r\n      in its commercial relations to foreign nations, is, like that of a\r\n      merchant with regard to the different people with whom he deals, to buy as\r\n      cheap, and to sell as dear as possible. But it will be most likely to buy\r\n      cheap, when, by the most perfect freedom of trade, it encourages all\r\n      nations to bring to it the goods which it has occasion to purchase; and,\r\n      for the same reason, it will be most likely to sell dear, when its markets\r\n      are thus filled with the greatest number of buyers. The act of navigation,\r\n      it is true, lays no burden upon foreign ships that come to export the\r\n      produce of British industry. Even the ancient aliens duty, which used to\r\n      be paid upon all goods, exported as well as imported, has, by several\r\n      subsequent acts, been taken off from the greater part of the articles of\r\n      exportation. But if foreigners, either by prohibitions or high duties, are\r\n      hindered from coming to sell, they cannot always afford to come to buy;\r\n      because, coming without a cargo, they must lose the freight from their own\r\n      country to Great Britain. By diminishing the number of sellers, therefore,\r\n      we necessarily diminish that of buyers, and are thus likely not only to\r\n      buy foreign goods dearer, but to sell our own cheaper, than if there was a\r\n      more perfect freedom of trade. As defence, however, is of much more\r\n      importance than opulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps, the wisest of\r\n      all the commercial regulations of England.\r\n\r\n      The second case, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some\r\n      burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, is when\r\n      some tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter. In this case,\r\n      it seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed upon the like\r\n      produce of the former. This would not give the monopoly of the home\r\n      market to domestic industry, nor turn towards a particular employment a\r\n      greater share of the stock and labour of the country, than what would\r\n      naturally go to it. It would only hinder any part of what would naturally\r\n      go to it from being turned away by the tax into a less natural direction,\r\n      and would leave the competition between foreign and domestic industry,\r\n      after the tax, as nearly as possible upon the same footing as before it.\r\n      In Great Britain, when any such tax is laid upon the produce of domestic\r\n      industry, it is usual, at the same time, in order to stop the clamorous\r\n      complaints of our merchants and manufacturers, that they will be undersold\r\n      at home, to lay a much heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign\r\n      goods of the same kind.\r\n\r\n      This second limitation of the freedom of trade, according to some people,\r\n      should, upon most occasions, be extended much farther than to the precise\r\n      foreign commodities which could come into competition with those which had\r\n      been taxed at home. When the necessaries of life have been taxed in any\r\n      country, it becomes proper, they pretend, to tax not only the like\r\n      necessaries of life imported from other countries, but all sorts of\r\n      foreign goods which can come into competition with any thing that is the\r\n      produce of domestic industry. Subsistence, they say, becomes necessarily\r\n      dearer in consequence of such taxes; and the price of labour must always\r\n      rise with the price of the labourer’s subsistence. Every commodity,\r\n      therefore, which is the produce of domestic industry, though not\r\n      immediately taxed itself, becomes dearer in consequence of such taxes,\r\n      because the labour which produces it becomes so. Such taxes, therefore,\r\n      are really equivalent, they say, to a tax upon every particular commodity\r\n      produced at home. In order to put domestic upon the same footing with\r\n      foreign industry, therefore, it becomes necessary, they think, to lay some\r\n      duty upon every foreign commodity, equal to this enhancement of the price\r\n      of the home commodities with which it can come into competition.\r\n\r\n      Whether taxes upon the necessaries of life, such as those in Great Britain\r\n      upon soap, salt, leather, candles, etc. necessarily raise the price of\r\n      labour, and consequently that of all other commodities, I shall consider\r\n      hereafter, when I come to treat of taxes. Supposing, however, in the mean\r\n      time, that they have this effect, and they have it undoubtedly, this\r\n      general enhancement of the price of all commodities, in consequence of\r\n      that labour, is a case which differs in the two following respects from\r\n      that of a particular commodity, of which the price was enhanced by a\r\n      particular tax immediately imposed upon it.\r\n\r\n      First, It might always be known with great exactness, how far the price of\r\n      such a commodity could be enhanced by such a tax; but how far the general\r\n      enhancement of the price of labour might affect that of every different\r\n      commodity about which labour was employed, could never be known with any\r\n      tolerable exactness. It would be impossible, therefore, to proportion,\r\n      with any tolerable exactness, the tax of every foreign, to the enhancement\r\n      of the price of every home commodity.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, Taxes upon the necessaries of life have nearly the same effect\r\n      upon the circumstances of the people as a poor soil and a bad climate.\r\n      Provisions are thereby rendered dearer, in the same manner as if it\r\n      required extraordinary labour and expense to raise them. As, in the\r\n      natural scarcity arising from soil and climate, it would be absurd to\r\n      direct the people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and\r\n      industry, so is it likewise in the artificial scarcity arising from such\r\n      taxes. To be left to accommodate, as well as they could, their industry to\r\n      their situation, and to find out those employments in which,\r\n      notwithstanding their unfavourable circumstances, they might have some\r\n      advantage either in the home or in the foreign market, is what, in both\r\n      cases, would evidently be most for their advantage. To lay a new-tax upon\r\n      them, because they are already overburdened with taxes, and because they\r\n      already pay too dear for the necessaries of life, to make them likewise\r\n      pay too dear for the greater part of other commodities, is certainly a\r\n      most absurd way of making amends.\r\n\r\n      Such taxes, when they have grown up to a certain height, are a curse equal\r\n      to the barrenness of the earth, and the inclemency of the heavens, and yet\r\n      it is in the richest and most industrious countries that they have been\r\n      most generally imposed. No other countries could support so great a\r\n      disorder. As the strongest bodies only can live and enjoy health under an\r\n      unwholesome regimen, so the nations only, that in every sort of industry\r\n      have the greatest natural and acquired advantages, can subsist and prosper\r\n      under such taxes. Holland is the country in Europe in which they abound\r\n      most, and which, from peculiar circumstances, continues to prosper, not by\r\n      means of them, as has been most absurdly supposed, but in spite of them.\r\n\r\n      As there are two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to lay\r\n      some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, so\r\n      there are two others in which it may sometimes be a matter of\r\n      deliberation, in the one, how far it is proper to continue the free\r\n      importation of certain foreign goods; and, in the other, how far, or in\r\n      what manner, it may be proper to restore that free importation, after it\r\n      has been for some time interrupted.\r\n\r\n      The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how far it\r\n      is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods, is\r\n      when some foreign nation restrains, by high duties or prohibitions, the\r\n      importation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge, in\r\n      this case, naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the\r\n      like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their\r\n      manufactures into ours. Nations, accordingly, seldom fail to retaliate in\r\n      this manner. The French have been particularly forward to favour their own\r\n      manufactures, by restraining the importation of such foreign goods as\r\n      could come into competition with them. In this consisted a great part of\r\n      the policy of Mr Colbert, who, notwithstanding his great abilities, seems\r\n      in this case to have been imposed upon by the sophistry of merchants and\r\n      manufacturers, who are always demanding a monopoly against their\r\n      countrymen. It is at present the opinion of the most intelligent men in\r\n      France, that his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his\r\n      country. That minister, by the tariff of 1667, imposed very high duties\r\n      upon a great number of foreign manufactures. Upon his refusing to moderate\r\n      them in favour of the Dutch, they, in 1671, prohibited the importation of\r\n      the wines, brandies, and manufactures of France. The war of 1672 seems to\r\n      have been in part occasioned by this commercial dispute. The peace of\r\n      Nimeguen put an end to it in 1678, by moderating some of those duties in\r\n      favour of the Dutch, who in consequence took off their prohibition. It was\r\n      about the same time that the French and English began mutually to oppress\r\n      each other’s industry, by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the\r\n      French, however, seem to have set the first example, The spirit of\r\n      hostility which has subsisted between the two nations ever since, has\r\n      hitherto hindered them from being moderated on either side. In 1697, the\r\n      English prohibited the importation of bone lace, the manufacture of\r\n      Flanders. The government of that country, at that time under the dominion\r\n      of Spain, prohibited, in return, the importation of English woollens. In\r\n      1700, the prohibition of importing bone lace into England was taken off\r\n      upon condition that the importation of English woollens into Flanders\r\n      should be put on the same footing as before.\r\n\r\n      There may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a\r\n      probability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or\r\n      prohibitions complained of. The recovery of a great foreign market will\r\n      generally more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying\r\n      dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether such\r\n      retaliations are likely to produce such an effect, does not, perhaps,\r\n      belong so much to the science of a legislator, whose deliberations ought\r\n      to be governed by general principles, which are always the same, as to the\r\n      skill of that insidious and crafty animal vulgarly called a statesman or\r\n      politician, whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of\r\n      affairs. When there is no probability that any such repeal can be\r\n      procured, it seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain\r\n      classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those\r\n      classes, but to almost all the other classes of them. When our neighbours\r\n      prohibit some manufacture of ours, we generally prohibit, not only the\r\n      same, for that alone would seldom affect them considerably, but some other\r\n      manufacture of theirs. This may, no doubt, give encouragement to some\r\n      particular class of workmen among ourselves, and, by excluding some of\r\n      their rivals, may enable them to raise their price in the home market.\r\n      Those workmen however, who suffered by our neighbours prohibition, will\r\n      not be benefited by ours. On the contrary, they, and almost all the other\r\n      classes of our citizens, will thereby be obliged to pay dearer than before\r\n      for certain goods. Every such law, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the\r\n      whole country, not in favour of that particular class of workmen who were\r\n      injured by our neighbours prohibitions, but of some other class.\r\n\r\n      The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, how far,\r\n      or in what manner, it is proper to restore the free importation of foreign\r\n      goods, after it has been for some time interrupted, is when particular\r\n      manufactures, by means of high duties or prohibitions upon all foreign\r\n      goods which can come into competition with them, have been so far extended\r\n      as to employ a great multitude of hands. Humanity may in this case require\r\n      that the freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations, and\r\n      with a good deal of reserve and circumspection. Were those high duties and\r\n      prohibitions taken away all at once, cheaper foreign goods of the same\r\n      kind might be poured so fast into the home market, as to deprive all at\r\n      once many thousands of our people of their ordinary employment and means\r\n      of subsistence. The disorder which this would occasion might no doubt be\r\n      very considerable. It would in all probability, however, be much less than\r\n      is commonly imagined, for the two following reasons.\r\n\r\n      First, All those manufactures of which any part is commonly exported to\r\n      other European countries without a bounty, could be very little affected\r\n      by the freest importation of foreign goods. Such manufactures must be sold\r\n      as cheap abroad as any other foreign goods of the same quality and kind,\r\n      and consequently must be sold cheaper at home. They would still,\r\n      therefore, keep possession of the home market; and though a capricious man\r\n      of fashion might sometimes prefer foreign wares, merely because they were\r\n      foreign, to cheaper and better goods of the same kind that were made at\r\n      home, this folly could, from the nature of things, extend to so few, that\r\n      it could make no sensible impression upon the general employment of the\r\n      people. But a great part of all the different branches of our woollen\r\n      manufacture, of our tanned leather, and of our hardware, are annually\r\n      exported to other European countries without any bounty, and these are the\r\n      manufactures which employ the greatest number of hands. The silk, perhaps,\r\n      is the manufacture which would suffer the most by this freedom of trade,\r\n      and after it the linen, though the latter much less than the former.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, Though a great number of people should, by thus restoring the\r\n      freedom of trade, be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employment\r\n      and common method of subsistence, it would by no means follow that they\r\n      would thereby be deprived either of employment or subsistence. By the\r\n      reduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war, more than\r\n      100,000 soldiers and seamen, a number equal to what is employed in the\r\n      greatest manufactures, were all at once thrown out of their ordinary\r\n      employment: but though they no doubt suffered some inconveniency, they\r\n      were not thereby deprived of all employment and subsistence. The greater\r\n      part of the seamen, it is probable, gradually betook themselves to the\r\n      merchant service as they could find occasion, and in the mean time both\r\n      they and the soldiers were absorbed in the great mass of the people, and\r\n      employed in a great variety of occupations. Not only no great convulsion,\r\n      but no sensible disorder, arose from so great a change in the situation of\r\n      more than 100,000 men, all accustomed to the use of arms, and many of them\r\n      to rapine and plunder. The number of vagrants was scarce anywhere sensibly\r\n      increased by it; even the wages of labour were not reduced by it in any\r\n      occupation, so far as I have been able to learn, except in that of seamen\r\n      in the merchant service. But if we compare together the habits of a\r\n      soldier and of any sort of manufacturer, we shall find that those of the\r\n      latter do not tend so much to disqualify him from being employed in a new\r\n      trade, as those of the former from being employed in any. The manufacturer\r\n      has always been accustomed to look for his subsistence from his labour\r\n      only; the soldier to expect it from his pay. Application and industry have\r\n      been familiar to the one; idleness and dissipation to the other. But it is\r\n      surely much easier to change the direction of industry from one sort of\r\n      labour to another, than to turn idleness and dissipation to any. To the\r\n      greater part of manufactures, besides, it has already been observed, there\r\n      are other collateral manufactures of so similar a nature, that a workman\r\n      can easily transfer his industry from one of them to another. The greater\r\n      part of such workmen, too, are occasionally employed in country labour.\r\n      The stock which employed them in a particular manufacture before, will\r\n      still remain in the country, to employ an equal number of people in some\r\n      other way. The capital of the country remaining the same, the demand for\r\n      labour will likewise be the same, or very nearly the same, though it may\r\n      be exerted in different places, and for different occupations. Soldiers\r\n      and seamen, indeed, when discharged from the king’s service, are at\r\n      liberty to exercise any trade within any town or place of Great Britain or\r\n      Ireland. Let the same natural liberty of exercising what species of\r\n      industry they please, be restored to all his Majesty’s subjects, in the\r\n      same manner as to soldiers and seamen; that is, break down the exclusive\r\n      privileges of corporations, and repeal the statute of apprenticeship, both\r\n      which are really encroachments upon natural Liberty, and add to those the\r\n      repeal of the law of settlements, so that a poor workman, when thrown out\r\n      of employment, either in one trade or in one place, may seek for it in\r\n      another trade or in another place, without the fear either of a\r\n      prosecution or of a removal; and neither the public nor the individuals\r\n      will suffer much more from the occasional disbanding some particular\r\n      classes of manufacturers, than from that of the soldiers. Our\r\n      manufacturers have no doubt great merit with their country, but they\r\n      cannot have more than those who defend it with their blood, nor deserve to\r\n      be treated with more delicacy.\r\n\r\n      To expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely\r\n      restored in Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or\r\n      Utopia should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the\r\n      public, but, what is much more unconquerable, the private interests of\r\n      many individuals, irresistibly oppose it. Were the officers of the army to\r\n      oppose, with the same zeal and unanimity, any reduction in the number of\r\n      forces, with which master manufacturers set themselves against every law\r\n      that is likely to increase the number of their rivals in the home market;\r\n      were the former to animate their soldiers, in the same manner as the\r\n      latter inflame their workmen, to attack with violence and outrage the\r\n      proposers of any such regulation; to attempt to reduce the army would be\r\n      as dangerous as it has now become to attempt to diminish, in any respect,\r\n      the monopoly which our manufacturers have obtained against us. This\r\n      monopoly has so much increased the number of some particular tribes of\r\n      them, that, like an overgrown standing army, they have become formidable\r\n      to the government, and, upon many occasions, intimidate the legislature.\r\n      The member of parliament who supports every proposal for strengthening\r\n      this monopoly, is sure to acquire not only the reputation of understanding\r\n      trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose\r\n      numbers and wealth render them of great importance. If he opposes them, on\r\n      the contrary, and still more, if he has authority enough to be able to\r\n      thwart them, neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank,\r\n      nor the greatest public services, can protect him from the most infamous\r\n      abuse and detraction, from personal insults, nor sometimes from real\r\n      danger, arising from the insolent outrage of furious and disappointed\r\n      monopolists.\r\n\r\n      The undertaker of a great manufacture, who, by the home markets being\r\n      suddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners, should be obliged to\r\n      abandon his trade, would no doubt suffer very considerably. That part of\r\n      his capital which had usually been employed in purchasing materials, and\r\n      in paying his workmen, might, without much difficulty, perhaps, find\r\n      another employment; but that part of it which was fixed in workhouses, and\r\n      in the instruments of trade, could scarce be disposed of without\r\n      considerable loss. The equitable regard, therefore, to his interest,\r\n      requires that changes of this kind should never be introduced suddenly,\r\n      but slowly, gradually, and after a very long warning. The legislature,\r\n      were it possible that its deliberations could be always directed, not by\r\n      the clamorous importunity of partial interests, but by an extensive view\r\n      of the general good, ought, upon this very account, perhaps, to be\r\n      particularly careful, neither to establish any new monopolies of this\r\n      kind, nor to extend further those which are already established. Every\r\n      such regulation introduces some degree of real disorder into the\r\n      constitution of the state, which it will be difficult afterwards to cure\r\n      without occasioning another disorder.\r\n\r\n      How far it may be proper to impose taxes upon the importation of foreign\r\n      goods, in order not to prevent their importation, but to raise a revenue\r\n      for government, I shall consider hereafter when I come to treat of taxes.\r\n      Taxes imposed with a view to prevent, or even to diminish importation, are\r\n      evidently as destructive of the revenue of the customs as of the freedom\r\n      of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESTRAINTS UPON\r\nTHE IMPORTATION OF GOODS OF ALMOST ALL KINDS, FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WITH WHICH\r\nTHE BALANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DISADVANTAGEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Part I—Of the Unreasonableness of those Restraints, even upon the\r\n      Principles of the Commercial System.\r\n\r\n      To lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods of almost\r\n      all kinds, from those particular countries with which the balance of trade\r\n      is supposed to be disadvantageous, is the second expedient by which the\r\n      commercial system proposes to increase the quantity of gold and silver.\r\n      Thus, in Great Britain, Silesia lawns may be imported for home\r\n      consumption, upon paying certain duties; but French cambrics and lawns are\r\n      prohibited to be imported, except into the port of London, there to be\r\n      warehoused for exportation. Higher duties are imposed upon the wines of\r\n      France than upon those of Portugal, or indeed of any other country. By\r\n      what is called the impost 1692, a duty of five and-twenty per cent. of the\r\n      rate or value, was laid upon all French goods; while the goods of other\r\n      nations were, the greater part of them, subjected to much lighter duties,\r\n      seldom exceeding five per cent. The wine, brandy, salt, and vinegar of\r\n      France, were indeed excepted; these commodities being subjected to other\r\n      heavy duties, either by other laws, or by particular clauses of the same\r\n      law. In 1696, a second duty of twenty-five per cent. the first not having\r\n      been thought a sufficient discouragement, was imposed upon all French\r\n      goods, except brandy; together with a new duty of five-and-twenty pounds\r\n      upon the ton of French wine, and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of\r\n      French vinegar. French goods have never been omitted in any of those\r\n      general subsidies or duties of five per cent. which have been imposed upon\r\n      all, or the greater part, of the goods enumerated in the book of rates. If\r\n      we count the one-third and two-third subsidies as making a complete\r\n      subsidy between them, there have been five of these general subsidies; so\r\n      that, before the commencement of the present war, seventy-five per cent.\r\n      may be considered as the lowest duty to which the greater part of the\r\n      goods of the growth, produce, or manufacture of France, were liable. But\r\n      upon the greater part of goods, those duties are equivalent to a\r\n      prohibition. The French, in their turn, have, I believe, treated our goods\r\n      and manufactures just as hardly; though I am not so well acquainted with\r\n      the particular hardships which they have imposed upon them. Those mutual\r\n      restraints have put an end to almost all fair commerce between the two\r\n      nations; and smugglers are now the principal importers, either of British\r\n      goods into France, or of French goods into Great Britain. The principles\r\n      which I have been examining, in the foregoing chapter, took their origin\r\n      from private interest and the spirit of monopoly; those which I am going\r\n      te examine in this, from national prejudice and animosity. They are,\r\n      accordingly, as might well be expected, still more unreasonable. They are\r\n      so, even upon the principles of the commercial system.\r\n\r\n      First, Though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between\r\n      France and England, for example, the balance would be in favour of France,\r\n      it would by no means follow that such a trade would be disadvantageous to\r\n      England, or that the general balance of its whole trade would thereby be\r\n      turned more against it. If the wines of France are better and cheaper than\r\n      those of Portugal, or its linens than those of Germany, it would be more\r\n      advantageous for Great Britain to purchase both the wine and the foreign\r\n      linen which it had occasion for of France, than of Portugal and Germany.\r\n      Though the value of the annual importations from France would thereby be\r\n      greatly augmented, the value of the whole annual importations would be\r\n      diminished, in proportion as the French goods of the same quality were\r\n      cheaper than those of the other two countries. This would be the case,\r\n      even upon the supposition that the whole French goods imported were to be\r\n      consumed in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      But, Secondly, A great part of them might be re-exported to other\r\n      countries, where, being sold with profit, they might bring back a return,\r\n      equal in value, perhaps, to the prime cost of the whole French goods\r\n      imported. What has frequently been said of the East India trade, might\r\n      possibly be true of the French; that though the greater part of East India\r\n      goods were bought with gold and silver, the re-exportation of a part of\r\n      them to other countries brought back more gold and silver to that which\r\n      carried on the trade, than the prime cost of the whole amounted to. One of\r\n      the most important branches of the Dutch trade at present, consists in the\r\n      carriage of French goods to other European countries. Some part even of\r\n      the French wine drank in Great Britain, is clandestinely imported from\r\n      Holland and Zealand. If there was either a free trade between France and\r\n      England, or if French goods could be imported upon paying only the same\r\n      duties as those of other European nations, to be drawn back upon\r\n      exportation, England might have some share of a trade which is found so\r\n      advantageous to Holland.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, and lastly, There is no certain criterion by which we can\r\n      determine on which side what is called the balance between any two\r\n      countries lies, or which of them exports to the greatest value. National\r\n      prejudice and animosity, prompted always by the private interest of\r\n      particular traders, are the principles which generally direct our judgment\r\n      upon all questions concerning it. There are two criterions, however, which\r\n      have frequently been appealed to upon such occasions, the custom-house\r\n      books and the course of exchange. The custom-house books, I think, it is\r\n      now generally acknowledged, are a very uncertain criterion, on account of\r\n      the inaccuracy of the valuation at which the greater part of goods are\r\n      rated in them. The course of exchange is, perhaps, almost equally so.\r\n\r\n      When the exchange between two places, such as London and Paris, is at par,\r\n      it is said to be a sign that the debts due from London to Paris are\r\n      compensated by those due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when a\r\n      premium is paid at London for a bill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign\r\n      that the debts due from London to Paris are not compensated by those due\r\n      from Paris to London, but that a balance in money must be sent out from\r\n      the latter place; for the risk, trouble, and expense, of exporting which,\r\n      the premium is both demanded and given. But the ordinary state of debt and\r\n      credit between those two cities must necessarily be regulated, it is said,\r\n      by the ordinary course of their dealings with one another. When neither of\r\n      them imports from from other to a greater amount than it exports to that\r\n      other, the debts and credits of each may compensate one another. But when\r\n      one of them imports from the other to a greater value than it exports to\r\n      that other, the former necessarily becomes indebted to the latter in a\r\n      greater sum than the latter becomes indebted to it: the debts and credits\r\n      of each do not compensate one another, and money must be sent out from\r\n      that place of which the debts overbalance the credits. The ordinary course\r\n      of exchange, therefore, being an indication of the ordinary state of debt\r\n      and credit between two places, must likewise be an indication of the\r\n      ordinary course of their exports and imports, as these necessarily\r\n      regulate that state.\r\n\r\n      But though the ordinary course of exchange shall be allowed to be a\r\n      sufficient indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between any\r\n      two places, it would not from thence follow, that the balance of trade was\r\n      in favour of that place which had the ordinary state of debt and credit in\r\n      its favour. The ordinary state of debt and credit between any two places\r\n      is not always entirely regulated by the ordinary course of their dealings\r\n      with one another, but is often influenced by that of the dealings of\r\n      either with many other places. If it is usual, for example, for the\r\n      merchants of England to pay for the goods which they buy of Hamburg,\r\n      Dantzic, Riga, etc. by bills upon Holland, the ordinary state of debt and\r\n      credit between England and Holland will not be regulated entirely by the\r\n      ordinary course of the dealings of those two countries with one another,\r\n      but will be influenced by that of the dealings in England with those other\r\n      places. England may be obliged to send out every year money to Holland,\r\n      though its annual exports to that country may exceed very much the annual\r\n      value of its imports from thence, and though what is called the balance of\r\n      trade may be very much in favour of England.\r\n\r\n      In the way, besides, in which the par of exchange has hitherto been\r\n      computed, the ordinary course of exchange can afford no sufficient\r\n      indication that the ordinary state of debt and credit is in favour of that\r\n      country which seems to have, or which is supposed to have, the ordinary\r\n      course of exchange in its favour; or, in other words, the real exchange\r\n      may be, and in fact often is, so very different from the computed one,\r\n      that, from the course of the latter, no certain conclusion can, upon many\r\n      occasions, be drawn concerning that of the former.\r\n\r\n      When for a sum or money paid in England, containing, according to the\r\n      standard of the English mint, a certain number of ounces of pure silver,\r\n      you receive a bill for a sum of money to be paid in France, containing,\r\n      according to the standard of the French mint, an equal number of ounces of\r\n      pure silver, exchange is said to be at par between England and France.\r\n      When you pay more, you are supposed to give a premium, and exchange is\r\n      said to be against England, and in favour of France. When you pay less,\r\n      you are supposed to get a premium, and exchange is said to be against\r\n      France, and in favour of England.\r\n\r\n      But, first, We cannot always judge of the value of the current money of\r\n      different countries by the standard of their respective mints. In some it\r\n      is more, in others it is less worn, clipt, and otherwise degenerated from\r\n      that standard. But the value of the current coin of every country,\r\n      compared with that of any other country, is in proportion, not to the\r\n      quantity of pure silver which it ought to contain, but to that which it\r\n      actually does contain. Before the reformation of the silver coin in King\r\n      William’s time, exchange between England and Holland, computed in the\r\n      usual manner, according to the standard of their respective mints, was\r\n      five-and twenty per cent. against England. But the value of the current\r\n      coin of England, as we learn from Mr Lowndes, was at that time rather more\r\n      than five-and-twenty per cent. below its standard value. The real\r\n      exchange, therefore, may even at that time have been in favour of England,\r\n      notwithstanding the computed exchange was so much against it; a smaller\r\n      number or ounces of pure silver, actually paid in England, may have\r\n      purchased a bill for a greater number of ounces of pure silver to be paid\r\n      in Holland, and the man who was supposed to give, may in reality have got\r\n      the premium. The French coin was, before the late reformation of the\r\n      English gold coin, much less wore than the English, and was perhaps two or\r\n      three per cent. nearer its standard. If the computed exchange with France,\r\n      therefore, was not more than two or three per cent. against England, the\r\n      real exchange might have been in its favour. Since the reformation of the\r\n      gold coin, the exchange has been constantly in favour of England, and\r\n      against France.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, In some countries the expense of coinage is defrayed by the\r\n      government; in others, it is defrayed by the private people, who carry\r\n      their bullion to the mint, and the government even derives some revenue\r\n      from the coinage. In England it is defrayed by the government; and if you\r\n      carry a pound weight of standard silver to the mint, you get back\r\n      sixty-two shillings, containing a pound weight of the like standard\r\n      silver. In France a duty of eight per cent. is deducted for the coinage,\r\n      which not only defrays the expense of it, but affords a small revenue to\r\n      the government. In England, as the coinage costs nothing, the current coin\r\n      can never be much more valuable than the quantity of bullion which it\r\n      actually contains. In France, the workmanship, as you pay for it, adds to\r\n      the value, in the same manner as to that of wrought plate. A sum of French\r\n      money, therefore, containing an equal weight of pure silver, is more\r\n      valuable than a sum of English money containing an equal weight of pure\r\n      silver, and must require more bullion, or other commodities, to purchase\r\n      it. Though the current coin of the two countries, therefore, were equally\r\n      near the standards of their respective mints, a sum of English money could\r\n      not well purchase a sum of French money containing an equal number of\r\n      ounces of pure silver, nor, consequently, a bill upon France for such a\r\n      sum. If, for such a bill, no more additional money was paid than what was\r\n      sufficient to compensate the expense of the French coinage, the real\r\n      exchange might be at par between the two countries; their debts and\r\n      credits might mutually compensate one another, while the computed exchange\r\n      was considerably in favour of France. If less than this was paid, the real\r\n      exchange might be in favour of England, while the computed was in favour\r\n      of France.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, and lastly, In some places, as at Amsterdam, Hamburg, Venice,\r\n      etc. foreign bills of exchange are paid in what they call bank money;\r\n      while in others, as at London, Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, etc. they are\r\n      paid in the common currency of the country. What is called bank money, is\r\n      always of more value than the same nominal sum of common currency. A\r\n      thousand guilders in the bank of Amsterdam, for example, are of more value\r\n      than a thousand guilders of Amsterdam currency. The difference between\r\n      them is called the agio of the bank, which at Amsterdam is generally about\r\n      five per cent. Supposing the current money of the two countries equally\r\n      near to the standard of their respective mints, and that the one pays\r\n      foreign bills in this common currency, while the other pays them in bank\r\n      money, it is evident that the computed exchange may be in favour of that\r\n      which pays in bank money, though the real exchange should be in favour of\r\n      that which pays in current money; for the same reason that the computed\r\n      exchange may be in favour of that which pays in better money, or in money\r\n      nearer to its own standard, though the real exchange should be in favour\r\n      of that which pays in worse. The computed exchange, before the late\r\n      reformation of the gold coin, was generally against London with Amsterdam,\r\n      Hamburg, Venice, and, I believe, with all other places which pay in what\r\n      is called bank money. It will by no means follow, however, that the real\r\n      exchange was against it. Since the reformation of the gold coin, it has\r\n      been in favour of London, even with those places. The computed exchange\r\n      has generally been in favour of London with Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, and,\r\n      if you except France, I believe with most other parts of Europe that pay\r\n      in common currency; and it is not improbable that the real exchange was so\r\n      too.\r\n\r\n      Digression concerning Banks of Deposit, particularly concerning that of\r\n      Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n      The currency of a great state, such as France or England, generally\r\n      consists almost entirely of its own coin. Should this currency, therefore,\r\n      be at any time worn, clipt, or otherwise degraded below its standard\r\n      value, the state, by a reformation of its coin, can effectually\r\n      re-establish its currency. But the currency of a small state, such as\r\n      Genoa or Hamburg, can seldom consist altogether in its own coin, but must\r\n      be made up, in a great measure, of the coins of all the neighbouring\r\n      states with which its inhabitants have a continual intercourse. Such a\r\n      state, therefore, by reforming its coin, will not always be able to reform\r\n      its currency. If foreign bills of exchange are paid in this currency, the\r\n      uncertain value of any sum, of what is in its own nature so uncertain,\r\n      must render the exchange always very much against such a state, its\r\n      currency being in all foreign states necessarily valued even below what it\r\n      is worth.\r\n\r\n      In order to remedy the inconvenience to which this disadvantageous\r\n      exchange must have subjected their merchants, such small states, when they\r\n      began to attend to the interest of trade, have frequently enacted that\r\n      foreign bills of exchange of a certain value should be paid, not in common\r\n      currency, but by an order upon, or by a transfer in the books of a certain\r\n      bank, established upon the credit, and under the protection of the state,\r\n      this bank being always obliged to pay, in good and true money, exactly\r\n      according to the standard of the state. The banks of Venice, Genoa,\r\n      Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, seem to have been all originally\r\n      established with this view, though some of them may have afterwards been\r\n      made subservient to other purposes. The money of such banks, being better\r\n      than the common currency of the country, necessarily bore an agio, which\r\n      was greater or smaller, according as the currency was supposed to be more\r\n      or less degraded below the standard of the state. The agio of the bank of\r\n      Hamburg, for example, which is said to be commonly about fourteen per\r\n      cent. is the supposed difference between the good standard money of the\r\n      state, and the clipt, worn, and diminished currency, poured into it from\r\n      all the neighbouring states.\r\n\r\n      Before 1609, the great quantity of clipt and worn foreign coin which the\r\n      extensive trade of Amsterdam brought from all parts of Europe, reduced the\r\n      value of its currency about nine per cent. below that of good money fresh\r\n      from the mint. Such money no sooner appeared, than it was melted down or\r\n      carried away, as it always is in such circumstances. The merchants, with\r\n      plenty of currency, could not always find a sufficient quantity of good\r\n      money to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of those bills, in\r\n      spite of several regulations which were made to prevent it, became in a\r\n      great measure uncertain.\r\n\r\n      In order to remedy these inconveniencies, a bank was established in 1609,\r\n      under the guarantee of the city. This bank received both foreign coin, and\r\n      the light and worn coin of the country, at its real intrinsic value in the\r\n      good standard money of the country, deducting only so much as was\r\n      necessary for defraying the expense of coinage and the other necessary\r\n      expense of management. For the value which remained after this small\r\n      deduction was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was called\r\n      bank money, which, as it represented money exactly according to the\r\n      standard of the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically\r\n      worth more than current money. It was at the same time enacted, that all\r\n      bills drawn upon or negotiated at Amsterdam, of the value of 600 guilders\r\n      and upwards, should be paid in bank money, which at once took away all\r\n      uncertainty in the value of those bills. Every merchant, in consequence of\r\n      this regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank, in order to\r\n      pay his foreign bills of exchange, which necessarily occasioned a certain\r\n      demand for bank money.\r\n\r\n      Bank money, over and above both its intrinsic superiority to currency, and\r\n      the additional value which this demand necessarily gives it, has likewise\r\n      some other advantages, It is secure from fire, robbery, and other\r\n      accidents; the city of Amsterdam is bound for it; it can be paid away by a\r\n      simple transfer, without the trouble of counting, or the risk of\r\n      transporting it from one place to another. In consequence of those\r\n      different advantages, it seems from the beginning to have borne an agio;\r\n      and it is generally believed that all the money originally deposited in\r\n      the bank, was allowed to remain there, nobody caring to demand payment of\r\n      a debt which he could sell for a premium in the market. By demanding\r\n      payment of the bank, the owner of a bank credit would lose this premium.\r\n      As a shilling fresh from the mint will buy no more goods in the market\r\n      than one of our common worn shillings, so the good and true money which\r\n      might be brought from the coffers of the bank into those of a private\r\n      person, being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the\r\n      country, would be of no more value than that currency, from which it could\r\n      no longer be readily distinguished. While it remained in the coffers of\r\n      the bank, its superiority was known and ascertained. When it had come into\r\n      those of a private person, its superiority could not well be ascertained\r\n      without more trouble than perhaps the difference was worth. By being\r\n      brought from the coffers of the bank, besides, it lost all the other\r\n      advantages of bank money; its security, its easy and safe transferability,\r\n      its use in paying foreign bills of exchange. Over and above all this, it\r\n      could not be brought from those coffers, as will appear by and by, without\r\n      previously paying for the keeping.\r\n\r\n      Those deposits of coin, or those deposits which the bank was bound to\r\n      restore in coin, constituted the original capital of the bank, or the\r\n      whole value of what was represented by what is called bank money. At\r\n      present they are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it. In\r\n      order to facilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for these many\r\n      years in the practice of giving credit in its books, upon deposits of gold\r\n      and silver bullion. This credit is generally about five per cent. below\r\n      the mint price of such bullion. The bank grants at the same time what is\r\n      called a recipice or receipt, entitling the person who makes the deposit,\r\n      or the bearer, to take out the bullion again at any time within six\r\n      months, upon transferring to the bank a quantity of bank money equal to\r\n      that for which credit had been given in its books when the deposit was\r\n      made, and upon paying one-fourth per cent. for the keeping, if the deposit\r\n      was in silver; and one-half per cent. if it was in gold; but at the same\r\n      time declaring, that in default of such payment, and upon the expiration\r\n      of this term, the deposit should belong to the bank, at the price at which\r\n      it had been received, or for which credit had been given in the transfer\r\n      books. What is thus paid for the keeping of the deposit may be considered\r\n      as a sort of warehouse rent; and why this warehouse rent should be so much\r\n      dearer for gold than for silver, several different reasons have been\r\n      assigned. The fineness of gold, it has been said, is more difficult to be\r\n      ascertained than that of silver. Frauds are more easily practised, and\r\n      occasion a greater loss in the most precious metal. Silver, besides, being\r\n      the standard metal, the state, it has been said, wishes to encourage more\r\n      the making of deposits of silver than those of gold.\r\n\r\n      Deposits of bullion are most commonly made when the price is somewhat\r\n      lower than ordinary, and they are taken out again when it happens to rise.\r\n      In Holland the market price of bullion is generally above the mint price,\r\n      for the same reason that it was so in England before the late reformation\r\n      of the gold coin. The difference is said to be commonly from about six to\r\n      sixteen stivers upon the mark, or eight ounces of silver, of eleven parts\r\n      of fine and one part alloy. The bank price, or the credit which the bank\r\n      gives for the deposits of such silver (when made in foreign coin, of which\r\n      the fineness is well known and ascertained, such as Mexico dollars), is\r\n      twenty-two guilders the mark: the mint price is about twenty-three\r\n      guilders, and the market price is from twenty-three guilders six, to\r\n      twenty-three guilders sixteen stivers, or from two to three per cent.\r\n      above the mint price.\r\n\r\n      The following are the prices at which the bank of Amsterdam at present\r\n      {September 1775} receives bullion and coin of different kinds:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SILVER\r\n     Mexico dollars .................  22  Guilders / mark\r\n     French crowns ..................  22\r\n     English silver coin.............  22\r\n     Mexico dollars, new coin........  21  10\r\n     Ducatoons.......................   3   0\r\n     Rix-dollars.....................   2   8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Bar silver, containing 11-12ths fine silver, 21 Guilders / mark, and in\r\n      this proportion down to 1-4th fine, on which 5 guilders are given. Fine\r\n      bars,................. 28 Guilders / mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GOLD\r\n     Portugal coin.................  310  Guilders / mark\r\n     Guineas.......................  310\r\n     Louis d’ors, new..............  310\r\n     Ditto        old..............  300\r\n     New ducats....................    4  19  8  per ducat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Bar or ingot gold is received in proportion to its fineness, compared with\r\n      the above foreign gold coin. Upon fine bars the bank gives 340 per mark.\r\n      In general, however, something more is given upon coin of a known\r\n      fineness, than upon gold and silver bars, of which the fineness cannot be\r\n      ascertained but by a process of melting and assaying.\r\n\r\n      The proportions between the bank price, the mint price, and the market\r\n      price of gold bullion, are nearly the same. A person can generally sell\r\n      his receipt for the difference between the mint price of bullion and the\r\n      market price. A receipt for bullion is almost always worth something, and\r\n      it very seldom happens, therefore, that anybody suffers his receipts to\r\n      expire, or allows his bullion to fall to the bank at the price at which it\r\n      had been received, either by not taking it out before the end of the six\r\n      months, or by neglecting to pay one fourth or one half per cent. in order\r\n      to obtain a new receipt for another six months. This, however, though it\r\n      happens seldom, is said to happen sometimes, and more frequently with\r\n      regard to gold than with regard to silver, on account of the higher\r\n      warehouse rent which is paid for the keeping of the more precious metal.\r\n\r\n      The person who, by making a deposit of bullion, obtains both a bank credit\r\n      and a receipt, pays his bills of exchange as they become due, with his\r\n      bank credit; and either sells or keeps his receipt, according as he judges\r\n      that the price of bullion is likely to rise or to fall. The receipt and\r\n      the bank credit seldom keep long together, and there is no occasion that\r\n      they should. The person who has a receipt, and who wants to take out\r\n      bullion, finds always plenty of bank credits, or bank money, to buy at the\r\n      ordinary price, and the person who has bank money, and wants to take out\r\n      bullion, finds receipts always in equal abundance.\r\n\r\n      The owners of bank credits, and the holders of receipts, constitute two\r\n      different sorts of creditors against the bank. The holder of a receipt\r\n      cannot draw out the bullion for which it is granted, without re-assigning\r\n      to the bank a sum of bank money equal to the price at which the bullion\r\n      had been received. If he has no bank money of his own, he must purchase it\r\n      of those who have it. The owner of bank money cannot draw out bullion,\r\n      without producing to the bank receipts for the quantity which he wants. If\r\n      he has none of his own, he must buy them of those who have them. The\r\n      holder of a receipt, when he purchases bank money, purchases the power of\r\n      taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the mint price is five per\r\n      cent. above the bank price. The agio of five per cent. therefore, which he\r\n      commonly pays for it, is paid, not for an imaginary, but for a real value.\r\n      The owner of bank money, when he purchases a receipt, purchases the power\r\n      of taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the market price is commonly\r\n      from two to three per cent. above the mint price. The price which he pays\r\n      for it, therefore, is paid likewise for a real value. The price of the\r\n      receipt, and the price of the bank money, compound or make up between them\r\n      the full value or price of the bullion.\r\n\r\n      Upon deposits of the coin current in the country, the bank grant receipts\r\n      likewise, as well as bank credits; but those receipts are frequently of no\r\n      value and will bring no price in the market. Upon ducatoons, for example,\r\n      which in the currency pass for three guilders three stivers each, the bank\r\n      gives a credit of three guilders only, or five per cent. below their\r\n      current value. It grants a receipt likewise, entitling the bearer to take\r\n      out the number of ducatoons deposited at any time within six months, upon\r\n      paying one fourth per cent. for the keeping. This receipt will frequently\r\n      bring no price in the market. Three guilders, bank money, generally sell\r\n      in the market for three guilders three stivers, the full value of the\r\n      ducatoons, if they were taken out of the bank; and before they can be\r\n      taken out, one-fourth per cent. must be paid for the keeping, which would\r\n      be mere loss to the holder of the receipt. If the agio of the bank,\r\n      however, should at any time fall to three per cent. such receipts might\r\n      bring some price in the market, and might sell for one and three-fourths\r\n      per cent. But the agio of the bank being now generally about five per\r\n      cent. such receipts are frequently allowed to expire, or, as they express\r\n      it, to fall to the bank. The receipts which are given for deposits of gold\r\n      ducats fall to it yet more frequently, because a higher warehouse rent, or\r\n      one half per cent. must be paid for the keeping of them, before they can\r\n      be taken out again. The five per cent. which the bank gains, when deposits\r\n      either of coin or bullion are allowed to fall to it, maybe considered as\r\n      the warehouse rent for the perpetual keeping of such deposits.\r\n\r\n      The sum of bank money, for which the receipts are expired, must be very\r\n      considerable. It must comprehend the whole original capital of the bank,\r\n      which, it is generally supposed, has been allowed to remain there from the\r\n      time it was first deposited, nobody caring either to renew his receipt, or\r\n      to take out his deposit, as, for the reasons already assigned, neither the\r\n      one nor the other could be done without loss. But whatever may be the\r\n      amount of this sum, the proportion which it bears to the whole mass of\r\n      bank money is supposed to be very small. The bank of Amsterdam has, for\r\n      these many years past, been the great warehouse of Europe for bullion, for\r\n      which the receipts are very seldom allowed to expire, or, as they express\r\n      it, to fall to the bank. The far greater part of the bank money, or of the\r\n      credits upon the books of the bank, is supposed to have been created, for\r\n      these many years past, by such deposits, which the dealers in bullion are\r\n      continually both making and withdrawing.\r\n\r\n      No demand can be made upon the bank, but by means of a recipice or\r\n      receipt. The smaller mass of bank money, for which the receipts are\r\n      expired, is mixed and confounded with the much greater mass for which they\r\n      are still in force; so that, though there may be a considerable sum of\r\n      bank money, for which there are no receipts, there is no specific sum or\r\n      portion of it which may not at any time be demanded by one. The bank\r\n      cannot be debtor to two persons for the same thing; and the owner of bank\r\n      money who has no receipt, cannot demand payment of the bank till he buys\r\n      one. In ordinary and quiet times, he can find no difficulty in getting one\r\n      to buy at the market price, which generally corresponds with the price at\r\n      which he can sell the coin or bullion it entitles him to take out of the\r\n      bank.\r\n\r\n      It might be otherwise during a public calamity; an invasion, for example,\r\n      such as that of the French in 1672. The owners of bank money being then\r\n      all eager to draw it out of the bank, in order to have it in their own\r\n      keeping, the demand for receipts might raise their price to an exorbitant\r\n      height. The holders of them might form extravagant expectations, and,\r\n      instead of two or three per cent. demand half the bank money for which\r\n      credit had been given upon the deposits that the receipts had respectively\r\n      been granted for. The enemy, informed of the constitution of the bank,\r\n      might even buy them up, in order to prevent the carrying away of the\r\n      treasure. In such emergencies, the bank, it is supposed, would break\r\n      through its ordinary rule of making payment only to the holders of\r\n      receipts. The holders of receipts, who had no bank money, must have\r\n      received within two or three per cent. of the value of the deposit for\r\n      which their respective receipts had been granted. The bank, therefore, it\r\n      is said, would in this case make no scruple of paying, either with money\r\n      or bullion, the full value of what the owners of bank money, who could get\r\n      no receipts, were credited for in its books; paying, at the same time, two\r\n      or three per cent. to such holders of receipts as had no bank money, that\r\n      being the whole value which, in this state of things, could justly be\r\n      supposed due to them.\r\n\r\n      Even in ordinary and quiet times, it is the interest of the holders of\r\n      receipts to depress the agio, in order either to buy bank money (and\r\n      consequently the bullion which their receipts would then enable them to\r\n      take out of the bank ) so much cheaper, or to sell their receipts to those\r\n      who have bank money, and who want to take out bullion, so much dearer; the\r\n      price of a receipt being generally equal to the difference between the\r\n      market price of bank money and that of the coin or bullion for which the\r\n      receipt had been granted. It is the interest of the owners of bank money,\r\n      on the contrary, to raise the agio, in order either to sell their bank\r\n      money so much dearer, or to buy a receipt so much cheaper. To prevent the\r\n      stock-jobbing tricks which those opposite interests might sometimes\r\n      occasion, the bank has of late years come to the resolution, to sell at\r\n      all times bank money for currency at five per cent. agio, and to buy it in\r\n      again at four per cent. agio. In consequence of this resolution, the agio\r\n      can never either rise above five, or sink below four per cent.; and the\r\n      proportion between the market price of bank and that of current money is\r\n      kept at all times very near the proportion between their intrinsic values.\r\n      Before this resolution was taken, the market price of bank money used\r\n      sometimes to rise so high as nine per cent. agio, and sometimes to sink so\r\n      low as par, according as opposite interests happened to influence the\r\n      market.\r\n\r\n      The bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited\r\n      with it, but for every guilder for which it gives credit in its books, to\r\n      keep in its repositories the value of a guilder either in money or\r\n      bullion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money or bullion for\r\n      which there are receipts in force for which it is at all times liable to\r\n      be called upon, and which in reality is continually going from it, and\r\n      returning to it again, cannot well be doubted. But whether it does so\r\n      likewise with regard to that part of its capital for which the receipts\r\n      are long ago expired, for which, in ordinary and quiet times, it cannot be\r\n      called upon, and which, in reality, is very likely to remain with it for\r\n      ever, or as long as the states of the United Provinces subsist, may\r\n      perhaps appear more uncertain. At Amsterdam, however, no point of faith is\r\n      better established than that, for every guilder circulated as bank money,\r\n      there is a correspondent guilder in gold or silver to be found in the\r\n      treasures of the bank. The city is guarantee that it should be so. The\r\n      bank is under the direction of the four reigning burgomasters who are\r\n      changed every year. Each new set of burgomasters visits the treasure,\r\n      compares it with the books, receives it upon oath, and delivers it over,\r\n      with the same awful solemnity to the set which succeeds; and in that sober\r\n      and religious country, oaths are not yet disregarded. A rotation of this\r\n      kind seems alone a sufficient security against any practices which cannot\r\n      be avowed. Amidst all the revolutions which faction has ever occasioned in\r\n      the government of Amsterdam, the prevailing party has at no time accused\r\n      their predecessors of infidelity in the administration of the bank. No\r\n      accusation could have affected more deeply the reputation and fortune of\r\n      the disgraced party; and if such an accusation could have been supported,\r\n      we may be assured that it would have been brought. In 1672, when the\r\n      French king was at Utrecht, the bank of Amsterdam paid so readily, as left\r\n      no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its engagements. Some\r\n      of the pieces which were then brought from its repositories, appeared to\r\n      have been scorched with the fire which happened in the town-house soon\r\n      after the bank was established. Those pieces, therefore, must have lain\r\n      there from that time.\r\n\r\n      What may be the amount of the treasure in the bank, is a question which\r\n      has long employed the speculations of the curious. Nothing but conjecture\r\n      can be offered concerning it. It is generally reckoned, that there are\r\n      about 2000 people who keep accounts with the bank; and allowing them to\r\n      have, one with another, the value of £1500 sterling lying upon their\r\n      respective accounts (a very large allowance), the whole quantity of bank\r\n      money, and consequently of treasure in the bank, will amount to about\r\n      £3,000,000 sterling, or, at eleven guilders the pound sterling, 33,000,000\r\n      of guilders; a great sum, and sufficient to carry on a very extensive\r\n      circulation, but vastly below the extravagant ideas which some people have\r\n      formed of this treasure.\r\n\r\n      The city of Amsterdam derives a considerable revenue from the bank.\r\n      Besides what may be called the warehouse rent above mentioned, each\r\n      person, upon first opening an account with the bank, pays a fee of ten\r\n      guilders; and for every new account, three guilders three stivers; for\r\n      every transfer, two stivers; and if the transfer is for less than 300\r\n      guilders, six stivers, in order to discourage the multiplicity of small\r\n      transactions. The person who neglects to balance his account twice in the\r\n      year, forfeits twenty-five guilders. The person who orders a transfer for\r\n      more than is upon his account, is obliged to pay three per cent. for the\r\n      sum overdrawn, and his order is set aside into the bargain. The bank is\r\n      supposed, too, to make a considerable profit by the sale of the foreign\r\n      coin or bullion which sometimes falls to it by the expiring of receipts,\r\n      and which is always kept till it can be sold with advantage. It makes a\r\n      profit, likewise, by selling bank money at five per cent. agio, and buying\r\n      it in at four. These different emoluments amount to a good deal more than\r\n      what is necessary for paying the salaries of officers, and defraying the\r\n      expense of management. What is paid for the keeping of bullion upon\r\n      receipts, is alone supposed to amount to a neat annual revenue of between\r\n      150,000 and 200,000 guilders. Public utility, however, and not revenue,\r\n      was the original object of this institution. Its object was to relieve the\r\n      merchants from the inconvenience of a disadvantageous exchange. The\r\n      revenue which has arisen from it was unforeseen, and may be considered as\r\n      accidental. But it is now time to return from this long digression, into\r\n      which I have been insensibly led, in endeavouring to explain the reasons\r\n      why the exchange between the countries which pay in what is called bank\r\n      money, and those which pay in common currency, should generally appear to\r\n      be in favour of the former, and against the latter. The former pay in a\r\n      species of money, of which the intrinsic value is always the same, and\r\n      exactly agreeable to the standard of their respective mints; the latter is\r\n      a species of money, of which the intrinsic value is continually varying,\r\n      and is almost always more or less below that standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART II.—Of the Unreasonableness of those extraordinary Restraints,\r\n      upon other Principles.\r\n\r\n      In the foregoing part of this chapter, I have endeavoured to show, even\r\n      upon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it is to lay\r\n      extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those\r\n      countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be\r\n      disadvantageous.\r\n\r\n      Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the\r\n      balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all\r\n      the other regulations of commerce, are founded. When two places trade with\r\n      one another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither\r\n      of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side,\r\n      that one of them loses, and the other gains, in proportion to its\r\n      declension from the exact equilibrium. Both suppositions are false. A\r\n      trade, which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies, may be, and\r\n      commonly is, disadvantageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to\r\n      be established, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter. But that trade\r\n      which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on\r\n      between any two places, is always advantageous, though not always equally\r\n      so, to both.\r\n\r\n      By advantage or gain, I understand, not the increase of the quantity of\r\n      gold and silver, but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce\r\n      of the land and labour of the country, or the increase of the annual\r\n      revenue of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n      If the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places consist\r\n      altogether in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon\r\n      most occasions, not only both gain, but they will gain equally, or very\r\n      nearly equally; each will, in this case, afford a market for a part of the\r\n      surplus produce of the other; each will replace a capital which had been\r\n      employed in raising and preparing for the market this part of the surplus\r\n      produce of the other, and which had been distributed among, and given\r\n      revenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants. Some part\r\n      of the inhabitants of each, therefore, will directly derive their revenue\r\n      and maintenance from the other. As the commodities exchanged, too, are\r\n      supposed to be of equal value, so the two capitals employed in the trade\r\n      will, upon most occasions, be equal, or very nearly equal; and both being\r\n      employed in raising the native commodities of the two countries, the\r\n      revenue and maintenance which their distribution will afford to the\r\n      inhabitants of each will be equal, or very nearly equal. This revenue and\r\n      maintenance, thus mutually afforded, will be greater or smaller, in\r\n      proportion to the extent of their dealings. If these should annually\r\n      amount to £100,000, for example, or to £1,000,000, on each side, each of\r\n      them will afford an annual revenue, in the one case, of £100,000, and, in\r\n      the other, of £1,000,000, to the inhabitants of the other.\r\n\r\n      If their trade should be of such a nature, that one of them exported to\r\n      the other nothing but native commodities, while the returns of that other\r\n      consisted altogether in foreign goods; the balance, in this case, would\r\n      still be supposed even, commodities being paid for with commodities. They\r\n      would, in this case too, both gain, but they would not gain equally; and\r\n      the inhabitants of the country which exported nothing but native\r\n      commodities, would derive the greatest revenue from the trade. If England,\r\n      for example, should import from France nothing but the native commodities\r\n      of that country, and not having such commodities of its own as were in\r\n      demand there, should annually repay them by sending thither a large\r\n      quantity of foreign goods, tobacco, we shall suppose, and East India\r\n      goods; this trade, though it would give some revenue to the inhabitants of\r\n      both countries, would give more to those of France than to those of\r\n      England. The whole French capital annually employed in it would annually\r\n      be distributed among the people of France; but that part of the English\r\n      capital only, which was employed in producing the English commodities with\r\n      which those foreign goods were purchased, would be annually distributed\r\n      among the people of England. The greater part of it would replace the\r\n      capitals which had been employed in Virginia, Indostan, and China, and\r\n      which had given revenue and maintenance to the inhabitants of those\r\n      distant countries. If the capitals were equal, or nearly equal, therefore,\r\n      this employment of the French capital would augment much more the revenue\r\n      of the people of France, than that of the English capital would the\r\n      revenue of the people of England. France would, in this case, carry on a\r\n      direct foreign trade of consumption with England; whereas England would\r\n      carry on a round-about trade of the same kind with France. The different\r\n      effects of a capital employed in the direct, and of one employed in the\r\n      round-about foreign trade of consumption, have already been fully\r\n      explained.\r\n\r\n      There is not, probably, between any two countries, a trade which consists\r\n      altogether in the exchange, either of native commodities on both sides, or\r\n      of native commodities on one side, and of foreign goods on the other.\r\n      Almost all countries exchange with one another, partly native and partly\r\n      foreign goods. That country, however, in whose cargoes there is the\r\n      greatest proportion of native, and the least of foreign goods, will always\r\n      be the principal gainer.\r\n\r\n      If it was not with tobacco and East India goods, but with gold and silver,\r\n      that England paid for the commodities annually imported from France, the\r\n      balance, in this case, would be supposed uneven, commodities not being\r\n      paid for with commodities, but with gold and silver. The trade, however,\r\n      would in this case, as in the foregoing, give some revenue to the\r\n      inhabitants of both countries, but more to those of France than to those\r\n      of England. It would give some revenue to those of England. The capital\r\n      which had been employed in producing the English goods that purchased this\r\n      gold and silver, the capital which had been distributed among, and given\r\n      revenue to, certain inhabitants of England, would thereby be replaced, and\r\n      enabled to continue that employment. The whole capital of England would no\r\n      more be diminished by this exportation of gold and silver, than by the\r\n      exportation of an equal value of any other goods. On the contrary, it\r\n      would, in most cases, be augmented. No goods are sent abroad but those for\r\n      which the demand is supposed to be greater abroad than at home, and of\r\n      which the returns, consequently, it is expected, will be of more value at\r\n      home than the commodities exported. If the tobacco which in England is\r\n      worth only £100,000, when sent to France, will purchase wine which is in\r\n      England worth £110,000, the exchange will augment the capital of England\r\n      by £10,000. If £100,000 of English gold, in the same manner, purchase\r\n      French wine, which in England is worth £110,000, this exchange will\r\n      equally augment the capital of England by £10,000. As a merchant, who has\r\n      £110,000 worth of wine in his cellar, is a richer man than he who has only\r\n      £100,000 worth of tobacco in his warehouse, so is he likewise a richer man\r\n      than he who has only £100,000 worth of gold in his coffers. He can put\r\n      into motion a greater quantity of industry, and give revenue, maintenance,\r\n      and employment, to a greater number of people, than either of the other\r\n      two. But the capital of the country is equal to the capital of all its\r\n      different inhabitants; and the quantity of industry which can be annually\r\n      maintained in it is equal to what all those different capitals can\r\n      maintain. Both the capital of the country, therefore, and the quantity of\r\n      industry which can be annually maintained in it, must generally be\r\n      augmented by this exchange. It would, indeed, be more advantageous for\r\n      England that it could purchase the wines of France with its own hardware\r\n      and broad cloth, than with either the tobacco of Virginia, or the gold and\r\n      silver of Brazil and Peru. A direct foreign trade of consumption is always\r\n      more advantageous than a round-about one. But a round-about foreign trade\r\n      of consumption, which is carried on with gold and silver, does not seem to\r\n      be less advantageous than any other equally round-about one. Neither is a\r\n      country which has no mines, more likely to be exhausted of gold and silver\r\n      by this annual exportation of those metals, than one which does not grow\r\n      tobacco by the like annual exportation of that plant. As a country which\r\n      has wherewithal to buy tobacco will never be long in want of it, so\r\n      neither will one be long in want of gold and silver which has wherewithal\r\n      to purchase those metals.\r\n\r\n      It is a losing trade, it is said, which a workman carries on with the\r\n      alehouse; and the trade which a manufacturing nation would naturally carry\r\n      on with a wine country, may be considered as a trade of the same nature. I\r\n      answer, that the trade with the alehouse is not necessarily a losing\r\n      trade. In its own nature it is just as advantageous as any other, though,\r\n      perhaps, somewhat more liable to be abused. The employment of a brewer,\r\n      and even that of a retailer of fermented liquors, are as necessary\r\n      divisions of labour as any other. It will generally be more advantageous\r\n      for a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has occasion for, than\r\n      to brew it himself; and if he is a poor workman, it will generally be more\r\n      advantageous for him to buy it by little and little of the retailer, than\r\n      a large quantity of the brewer. He may no doubt buy too much of either, as\r\n      he may of any other dealers in his neighbourhood; of the butcher, if he is\r\n      a glutton; or of the draper, if he affects to be a beau among his\r\n      companions. It is advantageous to the great body of workmen,\r\n      notwithstanding, that all these trades should be free, though this freedom\r\n      may be abused in all of them, and is more likely to be so, perhaps, in\r\n      some than in others. Though individuals, besides, may sometimes ruin their\r\n      fortunes by an excessive consumption of fermented liquors, there seems to\r\n      be no risk that a nation should do so. Though in every country there are\r\n      many people who spend upon such liquors more than they can afford, there\r\n      are always many more who spend less. It deserves to be remarked, too, that\r\n      if we consult experience, the cheapness of wine seems to be a cause, not\r\n      of drunkenness, but of sobriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries are\r\n      in general the soberest people of Europe; witness the Spaniards, the\r\n      Italians, and the inhabitants of the southern provinces of France. People\r\n      are seldom guilty of excess in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects\r\n      the character of liberality and good fellowship, by being profuse of a\r\n      liquor which is as cheap as small beer. On the contrary, in the countries\r\n      which, either from excessive heat or cold, produce no grapes, and where\r\n      wine consequently is dear and a rarity, drunkenness is a common vice, as\r\n      among the northern nations, and all those who live between the tropics,\r\n      the negroes, for example on the coast of Guinea. When a French regiment\r\n      comes from some of the northern provinces of France, where wine is\r\n      somewhat dear, to be quartered in the southern, where it is very cheap,\r\n      the soldiers, I have frequently heard it observed, are at first debauched\r\n      by the cheapness and novelty of good wine; but after a few months\r\n      residence, the greater part of them become as sober as the rest of the\r\n      inhabitants. Were the duties upon foreign wines, and the excises upon\r\n      malt, beer, and ale, to be taken away all at once, it might, in the same\r\n      manner, occasion in Great Britain a pretty general and temporary\r\n      drunkenness among the middling and inferior ranks of people, which would\r\n      probably be soon followed by a permanent and almost universal sobriety. At\r\n      present, drunkenness is by no means the vice of people of fashion, or of\r\n      those who can easily afford the most expensive liquors. A gentleman drunk\r\n      with ale has scarce ever been seen among us. The restraints upon the wine\r\n      trade in Great Britain, besides, do not so much seem calculated to hinder\r\n      the people from going, if I may say so, to the alehouse, as from going\r\n      where they can buy the best and cheapest liquor. They favour the wine\r\n      trade of Portugal, and discourage that of France. The Portuguese, it is\r\n      said, indeed, are better customers for our manufactures than the French,\r\n      and should therefore be encouraged in preference to them. As they give us\r\n      their custom, it is pretended we should give them ours. The sneaking arts\r\n      of underling tradesmen are thus erected into political maxims for the\r\n      conduct of a great empire; for it is the most underling tradesmen only who\r\n      make it a rule to employ chiefly their own customers. A great trader\r\n      purchases his goods always where they are cheapest and best, without\r\n      regard to any little interest of this kind.\r\n\r\n      By such maxims as these, however, nations have been taught that their\r\n      interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each nation has been\r\n      made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations\r\n      with which it trades, and to consider their gain as its own loss.\r\n      Commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations as among individuals,\r\n      a bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of\r\n      discord and animosity. The capricious ambition of kings and ministers has\r\n      not, during the present and the preceding century, been more fatal to the\r\n      repose of Europe, than the impertinent jealousy of merchants and\r\n      manufacturers. The violence and injustice of the rulers of mankind is an\r\n      ancient evil, for which, I am afraid, the nature of human affairs can\r\n      scarce admit of a remedy: but the mean rapacity, the monopolizing spirit,\r\n      of merchants and manufacturers, who neither are, nor ought to be, the\r\n      rulers of mankind, though it cannot, perhaps, be corrected, may very\r\n      easily be prevented from disturbing the tranquillity of anybody but\r\n      themselves.\r\n\r\n      That it was the spirit of monopoly which originally both invented and\r\n      propagated this doctrine, cannot be doubted and they who first taught it,\r\n      were by no means such fools as they who believed it. In every country it\r\n      always is, and must be, the interest of the great body of the people, to\r\n      buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest. The proposition is\r\n      so very manifest, that it seems ridiculous to take any pains to prove it;\r\n      nor could it ever have been called in question, had not the interested\r\n      sophistry of merchants and manufacturers confounded the common sense of\r\n      mankind. Their interest is, in this respect, directly opposite to that of\r\n      the great body of the people. As it is the interest of the freemen of a\r\n      corporation to hinder the rest of the inhabitants from employing any\r\n      workmen but themselves; so it is the interest of the merchants and\r\n      manufacturers of every country to secure to themselves the monopoly of the\r\n      home market. Hence, in Great Britain, and in most other European\r\n      countries, the extraordinary duties upon almost all goods imported by\r\n      alien merchants. Hence the high duties and prohibitions upon all those\r\n      foreign manufactures which can come into competition with our own. Hence,\r\n      too, the extraordinary restraints upon the importation of almost all sorts\r\n      of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed\r\n      to be disadvantageous; that is, from those against whom national animosity\r\n      happens ta be most violently inflamed.\r\n\r\n      The wealth of neighbouring nations, however, though dangerous in war and\r\n      politics, is certainly advantageous in trade. In a state of hostility, it\r\n      may enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies superior to our own;\r\n      but in a state of peace and commerce it must likewise enable them to\r\n      exchange with us to a greater value, and to afford a better market, either\r\n      for the immediate produce of our own industry, or for whatever is\r\n      purchased with that produce. As a rich man is likely to be a better\r\n      customer to the industrious people in his neighbourhood, than a poor, so\r\n      is likewise a rich nation. A rich man, indeed, who is himself a\r\n      manufacturer, is a very dangerous neighbour to all those who deal in the\r\n      same way. All the rest of the neighbourhood, however, by far the greatest\r\n      number, profit by the good market which his expense affords them. They\r\n      even profit by his underselling the poorer workmen who deal in the same\r\n      way with him. The manufacturers of a rich nation, in the same manner, may\r\n      no doubt be very dangerous rivals to those of their neighbours. This very\r\n      competition, however, is advantageous to the great body of the people, who\r\n      profit greatly, besides, by the good market which the great expense of\r\n      such a nation affords them in every other way. Private people, who want to\r\n      make a fortune, never think of retiring to the remote and poor provinces\r\n      of the country, but resort either to the capital, or to some of the great\r\n      commercial towns. They know, that where little wealth circulates, there is\r\n      little to be got; but that where a great deal is in motion, some share of\r\n      it may fall to them. The same maxim which would in this manner direct the\r\n      common sense of one, or ten, or twenty individuals, should regulate the\r\n      judgment of one, or ten, or twenty millions, and should make a whole\r\n      nation regard the riches of its neighbours, as a probable cause and\r\n      occasion for itself to acquire riches. A nation that would enrich itself\r\n      by foreign trade, is certainly most likely to do so, when its neighbours\r\n      are all rich, industrious and commercial nations. A great nation,\r\n      surrounded on all sides by wandering savages and poor barbarians, might,\r\n      no doubt, acquire riches by the cultivation of its own lands, and by its\r\n      own interior commerce, but not by foreign trade. It seems to have been in\r\n      this manner that the ancient Egyptians and the modern Chinese acquired\r\n      their great wealth. The ancient Egyptians, it is said, neglected foreign\r\n      commerce, and the modern Chinese, it is known, hold it in the utmost\r\n      contempt, and scarce deign to afford it the decent protection of the laws.\r\n      The modern maxims of foreign commerce, by aiming at the impoverishment of\r\n      all our neighbours, so far as they are capable of producing their intended\r\n      effect, tend to render that very commerce insignificant and contemptible.\r\n\r\n      It is in consequence of these maxims, that the commerce between France and\r\n      England has, in both countries, been subjected to so many discouragements\r\n      and restraints. If those two countries, however, were to consider their\r\n      real interest, without either mercantile jealousy or national animosity,\r\n      the commerce of France might be more advantageous to Great Britain than\r\n      that of any other country, and, for the same reason, that of Great Britain\r\n      to France. France is the nearest neighbour to Great Britain. In the trade\r\n      between the southern coast of England and the northern and north-western\r\n      coast of France, the returns might be expected, in the same manner as in\r\n      the inland trade, four, five, or six times in the year. The capital,\r\n      therefore, employed in this trade could, in each of the two countries,\r\n      keep in motion four, five, or six times the quantity of industry, and\r\n      afford employment and subsistence to four, five, or six times the number\r\n      of people, which all equal capital could do in the greater part of the\r\n      other branches of foreign trade. Between the parts of France and Great\r\n      Britain most remote from one another, the returns might be expected, at\r\n      least, once in the year; and even this trade would so far be at least\r\n      equally advantageous, as the greater part of the other branches of our\r\n      foreign European trade. It would be, at least, three times more\r\n      advantageous than the boasted trade with our North American colonies, in\r\n      which the returns were seldom made in less than three years, frequently\r\n      not in less than four or five years. France, besides, is supposed to\r\n      contain 24,000,000 of inhabitants. Our North American colonies were never\r\n      supposed to contain more than 3,000,000; and France is a much richer\r\n      country than North America; though, on account of the more unequal\r\n      distribution of riches, there is much more poverty and beggary in the one\r\n      country than in the other. France, therefore, could afford a market at\r\n      least eight times more extensive, and, on account of the superior\r\n      frequency of the returns, four-and-twenty times more advantageous than\r\n      that which our North American colonies ever afforded. The trade of Great\r\n      Britain would be just as advantageous to France, and, in proportion to the\r\n      wealth, population, and proximity of the respective countries, would have\r\n      the same superiority over that which France carries on with her own\r\n      colonies. Such is the very great difference between that trade which the\r\n      wisdom of both nations has thought proper to discourage, and that which it\r\n      has favoured the most.\r\n\r\n      But the very same circumstances which would have rendered an open and free\r\n      commerce between the two countries so advantageous to both, have\r\n      occasioned the principal obstructions to that commerce. Being neighbours,\r\n      they are necessarily enemies, and the wealth and power of each becomes,\r\n      upon that account, more formidable to the other; and what would increase\r\n      the advantage of national friendship, serves only to inflame the violence\r\n      of national animosity. They are both rich and industrious nations; and the\r\n      merchants and manufacturers of each dread the competition of the skill and\r\n      activity of those of the other. Mercantile jealousy is excited, and both\r\n      inflames, and is itself inflamed, by the violence of national animosity,\r\n      and the traders of both countries have announced, with all the passionate\r\n      confidence of interested falsehood, the certain ruin of each, in\r\n      consequence of that unfavourable balance of trade, which, they pretend,\r\n      would be the infallible effect of an unrestrained commerce with the other.\r\n\r\n      There is no commercial country in Europe, of which the approaching ruin\r\n      has not frequently been foretold by the pretended doctors of this system,\r\n      from all unfavourably balance of trade. After all the anxiety, however,\r\n      which they have excited about this, after all the vain attempts of almost\r\n      all trading nations to turn that balance in their own favour, and against\r\n      their neighbours, it does not appear that any one nation in Europe has\r\n      been, in any respect, impoverished by this cause. Every town and country,\r\n      on the contrary, in proportion as they have opened their ports to all\r\n      nations, instead of being ruined by this free trade, as the principles of\r\n      the commercial system would lead us to expect, have been enriched by it.\r\n      Though there are in Europe indeed, a few towns which, in same respects,\r\n      deserve the name of free ports, there is no country which does so.\r\n      Holland, perhaps, approaches the nearest to this character of any, though\r\n      still very remote from it; and Holland, it is acknowledged, not only\r\n      derives its whole wealth, but a great part of its necessary subsistence,\r\n      from foreign trade.\r\n\r\n      There is another balance, indeed, which has already been explained, very\r\n      different from the balance of trade, and which, according as it happens to\r\n      be either favourable or unfavourable, necessarily occasions the prosperity\r\n      or decay of every nation. This is the balance of the annual produce and\r\n      consumption. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce, it has\r\n      already been observed, exceeds that of the annual consumption, the capital\r\n      of the society must annually increase in proportion to this excess. The\r\n      society in this case lives within its revenue; and what is annually saved\r\n      out of its revenue, is naturally added to its capital, and employed so as\r\n      to increase still further the annual produce. If the exchangeable value of\r\n      the annual produce, on the contrary, fall short of the annual consumption,\r\n      the capital of the society must annually decay in proportion to this\r\n      deficiency. The expense of the society, in this case, exceeds its revenue,\r\n      and necessarily encroaches upon its capital. Its capital, therefore, must\r\n      necessarily decay, and, together with it, the exchangeable value of the\r\n      annual produce of its industry.\r\n\r\n      This balance of produce and consumption is entirely different from what is\r\n      called the balance of trade. It might take place in a nation which had no\r\n      foreign trade, but which was entirely separated from all the world. It may\r\n      take place in the whole globe of the earth, of which the wealth,\r\n      population, and improvement, may be either gradually increasing or\r\n      gradually decaying.\r\n\r\n      The balance of produce and consumption may be constantly in favour of a\r\n      nation, though what is called the balance of trade be generally against\r\n      it. A nation may import to a greater value than it exports for half a\r\n      century, perhaps, together; the gold and silver which comes into it during\r\n      all this time, may be all immediately sent out of it; its circulating coin\r\n      may gradually decay, different sorts of paper money being substituted in\r\n      its place, and even the debts, too, which it contracts in the principal\r\n      nations with whom it deals, may be gradually increasing; and yet its real\r\n      wealth, the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its lands and\r\n      labour, may, during the same period, have been increasing in a much\r\n      greater proportion. The state of our North American colonies, and of the\r\n      trade which they carried on with Great Britain, before the commencement of\r\n      the present disturbances, {This paragraph was written in the year 1775.}\r\n      may serve as a proof that this is by no means an impossible supposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOF DRAWBACKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Merchants and manufacturers are not contented with the monopoly of the\r\n      home market, but desire likewise the most extensive foreign sale for their\r\n      goods. Their country has no jurisdiction in foreign nations, and therefore\r\n      can seldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally obliged,\r\n      therefore, to content themselves with petitioning for certain\r\n      encouragements to exportation.\r\n\r\n      Of these encouragements, what are called drawbacks seem to be the most\r\n      reasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation, either\r\n      the whole, or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed upon\r\n      domestic industry, can never occasion the exportation of a greater\r\n      quantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been\r\n      imposed. Such encouragements do not tend to turn towards any particular\r\n      employment a greater share of the capital of the country, than what would\r\n      go to that employment of its own accord, but only to hinder the duty from\r\n      driving away any part of that share to other employments. They tend not to\r\n      overturn that balance which naturally establishes itself among all the\r\n      various employments of the society, but to hinder it from being overturned\r\n      by the duty. They tend not to destroy, but to preserve, what it is in most\r\n      cases advantageous to preserve, the natural division and distribution of\r\n      labour in the society.\r\n\r\n      The same thing may be said of the drawbacks upon the re-exportation of\r\n      foreign goods imported, which, in Great Britain, generally amount to by\r\n      much the largest part of the duty upon importation. By the second of the\r\n      rules, annexed to the act of parliament, which imposed what is now called\r\n      the old subsidy, every merchant, whether English or alien. was allowed to\r\n      draw back half that duty upon exportation; the English merchant, provided\r\n      the exportation took place within twelve months; the alien, provided it\r\n      took place within nine months. Wines, currants, and wrought silks, were\r\n      the only goods which did not fall within this rule, having other and more\r\n      advantageous allowances. The duties imposed by this act of parliament\r\n      were, at that time, the only duties upon the importation of foreign goods.\r\n      The term within which this, and all other drawbacks could be claimed, was\r\n      afterwards (by 7 Geo. I. chap. 21. sect. 10.) extended to three years.\r\n\r\n      The duties which have been imposed since the old subsidy, are, the greater\r\n      part of them, wholly drawn back upon exportation. This general rule,\r\n      however, is liable to a great number of exceptions; and the doctrine of\r\n      drawbacks has become a much less simple matter than it was at their first\r\n      institution.\r\n\r\n      Upon the exportation of some foreign goods, of which it was expected that\r\n      the importation would greatly exceed what was necessary for the home\r\n      consumption, the whole duties are drawn back, without retaining even half\r\n      the old subsidy. Before the revolt of our North American colonies, we had\r\n      the monopoly of the tobacco of Maryland and Virginia. We imported about\r\n      ninety-six thousand hogsheads, and the home consumption was not supposed\r\n      to exceed fourteen thousand. To facilitate the great exportation which was\r\n      necessary, in order to rid us of the rest, the whole duties were drawn\r\n      back, provided the exportation took place within three years.\r\n\r\n      We still have, though not altogether, yet very nearly, the monopoly of the\r\n      sugars of our West Indian islands. If sugars are exported within a year,\r\n      therefore, all the duties upon importation are drawn back; and if exported\r\n      within three years, all the duties, except half the old subsidy, which\r\n      still continues to be retained upon the exportation of the greater part of\r\n      goods. Though the importation of sugar exceeds a good deal what is\r\n      necessary for the home consumption, the excess is inconsiderable, in\r\n      comparison of what it used to be in tobacco.\r\n\r\n      Some goods, the particular objects of the jealousy of our own\r\n      manufacturers, are prohibited to be imported for home consumption. They\r\n      may, however, upon paying certain duties, be imported and warehoused for\r\n      exportation. But upon such exportation no part of these duties is drawn\r\n      back. Our manufacturers are unwilling, it seems, that even this restricted\r\n      importation should be encouraged, and are afraid lest some part of these\r\n      goods should be stolen out of the warehouse, and thus come into\r\n      competition with their own. It is under these regulations only that we can\r\n      import wrought silks, French cambrics and lawns, calicoes, painted,\r\n      printed, stained, or dyed, etc.\r\n\r\n      We are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choose\r\n      rather to forego a profit to ourselves than to suffer those whom we\r\n      consider as our enemies to make any profit by our means. Not only half the\r\n      old subsidy, but the second twenty-five per cent. is retained upon the\r\n      exportation of all French goods.\r\n\r\n      By the fourth of the rules annexed to the old subsidy, the drawback\r\n      allowed upon the exportation of all wines amounted to a great deal more\r\n      than half the duties which were at that time paid upon their importation;\r\n      and it seems at that time to have been the object of the legislature to\r\n      give somewhat more than ordinary encouragement to the carrying trade in\r\n      wine. Several of the other duties, too which were imposed either at the\r\n      same time or subsequent to the old subsidy, what is called the additional\r\n      duty, the new subsidy, the one-third and two-thirds subsidies, the impost\r\n      1692, the tonnage on wine, were allowed to be wholly drawn back upon\r\n      exportation. All those duties, however, except the additional duty and\r\n      impost 1692, being paid down in ready money upon importation, the interest\r\n      of so large a sum occasioned an expense, which made it unreasonable to\r\n      expect any profitable carrying trade in this article. Only a part,\r\n      therefore of the duty called the impost on wine, and no part of the\r\n      twenty-five pounds the ton upon French wines, or of the duties imposed in\r\n      1745, in 1763, and in 1778, were allowed to be drawn back upon\r\n      exportation. The two imposts of five per cent. imposed in 1779 and 1781,\r\n      upon all the former duties of customs, being allowed to be wholly drawn\r\n      back upon the exportation of all other goods, were likewise allowed to be\r\n      drawn back upon that of wine. The last duty that has been particularly\r\n      imposed upon wine, that of 1780, is allowed to be wholly drawn back; an\r\n      indulgence which, when so many heavy duties are retained, most probably\r\n      could never occasion the exportation of a single ton of wine. These rules\r\n      took place with regard to all places of lawful exportation, except the\r\n      British colonies in America.\r\n\r\n      The 15th Charles II, chap. 7, called an act for the encouragement of\r\n      trade, had given Great Britain the monopoly of supplying the colonies with\r\n      all the commodities of the growth or manufacture of Europe, and\r\n      consequently with wines. In a country of so extensive a coast as our North\r\n      American and West Indian colonies, where our authority was always so very\r\n      slender, and where the inhabitants were allowed to carry out in their own\r\n      ships their non-enumerated commodities, at first to all parts of Europe,\r\n      and afterwards to all parts of Europe south of Cape Finisterre, it is not\r\n      very probable that this monopoly could ever be much respected; and they\r\n      probably at all times found means of bringing back some cargo from the\r\n      countries to which they were allowed to carry out one. They seem, however,\r\n      to have found some difficulty in importing European wines from the places\r\n      of their growth; and they could not well import them from Great Britain,\r\n      where they were loaded with many heavy duties, of which a considerable\r\n      part was not drawn back upon exportation. Madeira wine, not being an\r\n      European commodity, could be imported directly into America and the West\r\n      Indies, countries which, in all their non-enumerated commodities, enjoyed\r\n      a free trade to the island of Madeira. These circumstances had probably\r\n      introduced that general taste for Madeira wine, which our officers found\r\n      established in all our colonies at the commencement of the war which began\r\n      in 1755, and which they brought back with them to the mother country,\r\n      where that wine had not been much in fashion before. Upon the conclusion\r\n      of that war, in 1763 (by the 4th Geo. III, chap. 15, sect. 12), all the\r\n      duties except £3, 10s. were allowed to be drawn back upon the exportation\r\n      to the colonies of all wines, except French wines, to the commerce and\r\n      consumption of which national prejudice would allow no sort of\r\n      encouragement. The period between the granting of this indulgence and the\r\n      revolt of our North American colonies, was probably too short to admit of\r\n      any considerable change in the customs of those countries.\r\n\r\n      The same act which, in the drawbacks upon all wines, except French wines,\r\n      thus favoured the colonies so much more than other countries, in those\r\n      upon the greater part of other commodities, favoured them much less. Upon\r\n      the exportation of the greater part of commodities to other countries,\r\n      half the old subsidy was drawn back. But this law enacted, that no part of\r\n      that duty should be drawn back upon the exportation to the colonies of any\r\n      commodities of the growth or manufacture either of Europe or the East\r\n      Indies, except wines, white calicoes, and muslins.\r\n\r\n      Drawbacks were, perhaps, originally granted for the encouragement of the\r\n      carrying trade, which, as the freight of the ship is frequently paid by\r\n      foreigners in money, was supposed to be peculiarly fitted for bringing\r\n      gold and silver into the country. But though the carrying trade certainly\r\n      deserves no peculiar encouragement, though the motive of the institution\r\n      was, perhaps, abundantly foolish, the institution itself seems reasonable\r\n      enough. Such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a greater share of the\r\n      capital of the country than what would have gone to it of its own accord,\r\n      had there been no duties upon importation; they only prevent its being\r\n      excluded altogether by those duties. The carrying trade, though it\r\n      deserves no preference, ought not to be precluded, but to be left free,\r\n      like all other trades. It is a necessary resource to those capitals which\r\n      cannot find employment, either in the agriculture or in the manufactures\r\n      of the country, either in its home trade, or in its foreign trade of\r\n      consumption.\r\n\r\n      The revenue of the customs, instead of suffering, profits from such\r\n      drawbacks, by that part of the duty which is retained. If the whole duties\r\n      had been retained, the foreign goods upon which they are paid could seldom\r\n      have been exported, nor consequently imported, for want of a market. The\r\n      duties, therefore, of which a part is retained, would never have been\r\n      paid.\r\n\r\n      These reasons seem sufficiently to justify drawbacks, and would justify\r\n      them, though the whole duties, whether upon the produce of domestic\r\n      industry or upon foreign goods, were always drawn back upon exportation.\r\n      The revenue of excise would, in this case indeed, suffer a little, and\r\n      that of the customs a good deal more; but the natural balance of industry,\r\n      the natural division and distribution of labour, which is always more or\r\n      less disturbed by such duties, would be more nearly re-established by such\r\n      a regulation.\r\n\r\n      These reasons, however, will justify drawbacks only upon exporting goods\r\n      to those countries which are altogether foreign and independent, not to\r\n      those in which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy a monopoly. A\r\n      drawback, for example, upon the exportation of European goods to our\r\n      American colonies, will not always occasion a greater exportation than\r\n      what would have taken place without it. By means of the monopoly which our\r\n      merchants and manufacturers enjoy there, the same quantity might\r\n      frequently, perhaps, be sent thither, though the whole duties were\r\n      retained. The drawback, therefore, may frequently be pure loss to the\r\n      revenue of excise and customs, without altering the state of the trade, or\r\n      rendering it in any respect more extensive. How far such drawbacks can be\r\n      justified as a proper encouragement to the industry of our colonies, or\r\n      how far it is advantageous to the mother country that they should be\r\n      exempted from taxes which are paid by all the rest of their\r\n      fellow-subjects, will appear hereafter, when I come to treat of colonies.\r\n\r\n      Drawbacks, however, it must always be understood, are useful only in those\r\n      cases in which the goods, for the exportation of which they are given, are\r\n      really exported to some foreign country, and not clandestinely re-imported\r\n      into our own. That some drawbacks, particularly those upon tobacco, have\r\n      frequently been abused in this manner, and have given occasion to many\r\n      frauds, equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair trader, is\r\n      well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOF BOUNTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Bounties upon exportation are, in Great Britain, frequently petitioned\r\n      for, and sometimes granted, to the produce of particular branches of\r\n      domestic industry. By means of them, our merchants and manufacturers, it\r\n      is pretended, will be enabled to sell their goods as cheap or cheaper than\r\n      their rivals in the foreign market. A greater quantity, it is said, will\r\n      thus be exported, and the balance of trade consequently turned more in\r\n      favour of our own country. We cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the\r\n      foreign, as we have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to\r\n      buy their goods, as we have done our own countrymen. The next best\r\n      expedient, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It\r\n      is in this manner that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole\r\n      country, and to put money into all our pockets, by means of the balance of\r\n      trade.\r\n\r\n      Bounties, it is allowed, ought to be given to those branches of trade only\r\n      which cannot be carried on without them. But every branch of trade in\r\n      which the merchant can sell his goods for a price which replaces to him,\r\n      with the ordinary profits of stock, the whole capital employed in\r\n      preparing and sending them to market, can be carried on without a bounty.\r\n      Every such branch is evidently upon a level with all the other branches of\r\n      trade which are carried on without bounties, and cannot, therefore,\r\n      require one more than they. Those trades only require bounties, in which\r\n      the merchant is obliged to sell his goods for a price which does not\r\n      replace to him his capital, together with the ordinary profit, or in which\r\n      he is obliged to sell them for less than it really cost him to send them\r\n      to market. The bounty is given in order to make up this loss, and to\r\n      encourage him to continue, or, perhaps, to begin a trade, of which the\r\n      expense is supposed to be greater than the returns, of which every\r\n      operation eats up a part of the capital employed in it, and which is of\r\n      such a nature, that if all other trades resembled it, there would soon be\r\n      no capital left in the country.\r\n\r\n      The trades, it is to be observed, which are carried on by means of\r\n      bounties, are the only ones which can be carried on between two nations\r\n      for any considerable time together, in such a manner as that one of them\r\n      shall always and regularly lose, or sell its goods for less than it\r\n      really cost to send them to market. But if the bounty did not repay to the\r\n      merchant what he would otherwise lose upon the price of his goods, his own\r\n      interest would soon oblige him to employ his stock in another way, or to\r\n      find out a trade in which the price of the goods would replace to him,\r\n      with the ordinary profit, the capital employed in sending them to market.\r\n      The effect of bounties, like that of all the other expedients of the\r\n      mercantile system, can only be to force the trade of a country into a\r\n      channel much less advantageous than that in which it would naturally run\r\n      of its own accord.\r\n\r\n      The ingenious and well-informed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade\r\n      has shown very clearly, that since the bounty upon the exportation of corn\r\n      was first established, the price of the corn exported, valued moderately\r\n      enough, has exceeded that of the corn imported, valued very high, by a\r\n      much greater sum than the amount of the whole bounties which have been\r\n      paid during that period. This, he imagines, upon the true principles of\r\n      the mercantile system, is a clear proof that this forced corn trade is\r\n      beneficial to the nation, the value of the exportation exceeding that of\r\n      the importation by a much greater sum than the whole extraordinary expense\r\n      which the public has been at in order to get it exported. He does not\r\n      consider that this extraordinary expense, or the bounty, is the smallest\r\n      part of the expense which the exportation of corn really costs the\r\n      society. The capital which the farmer employed in raising it must likewise\r\n      be taken into the account. Unless the price of the corn, when sold in the\r\n      foreign markets, replaces not only the bounty, but this capital, together\r\n      with the ordinary profits of stock, the society is a loser by the\r\n      difference, or the national stock is so much diminished. But the very\r\n      reason for which it has been thought necessary to grant a bounty, is the\r\n      supposed insufficiency of the price to do this.\r\n\r\n      The average price of corn, it has been said, has fallen considerably since\r\n      the establishment of the bounty. That the average price of corn began to\r\n      fall somewhat towards the end of the last century, and has continued to do\r\n      so during the course of the sixty-four first years of the present, I have\r\n      already endeavoured to show. But this event, supposing it to be real, as I\r\n      believe it to be, must have happened in spite of the bounty, and cannot\r\n      possibly have happened in consequence of it. It has happened in France, as\r\n      well as in England, though in France there was not only no bounty, but,\r\n      till 1764, the exportation of corn was subjected to a general prohibition.\r\n      This gradual fall in the average price of grain, it is probable,\r\n      therefore, is ultimately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the\r\n      other, but to that gradual and insensible rise in the real value of\r\n      silver, which, in the first book of this discourse, I have endeavoured to\r\n      show, has taken place in the general market of Europe during the course of\r\n      the present century. It seems to be altogether impossible that the bounty\r\n      could ever contribute to lower the price of grain.\r\n\r\n      In years of plenty, it has already been observed, the bounty, by\r\n      occasioning an extraordinary exportation, necessarily keeps up the price\r\n      of corn in the home market above what it would naturally fall to. To do so\r\n      was the avowed purpose of the institution. In years of scarcity, though\r\n      the bounty is frequently suspended, yet the great exportation which it\r\n      occasions in years of plenty, must frequently hinder, more or less, the\r\n      plenty of one year from relieving the scarcity of another. Both in years\r\n      of plenty and in years of scarcity, therefore, the bounty necessarily\r\n      tends to raise the money price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwise\r\n      would be in the home market.\r\n\r\n      That in the actual state of tillage the bounty must necessarily have this\r\n      tendency, will not, I apprehend, be disputed by any reasonable person. But\r\n      it has been thought by many people, that it tends to encourage tillage,\r\n      and that in two different ways; first, by opening a more extensive foreign\r\n      market to the corn of the farmer, it tends, they imagine, to increase the\r\n      demand for, and consequently the production of, that commodity; and,\r\n      secondly by securing to him a better price than he could otherwise expect\r\n      in the actual state of tillage, it tends, they suppose, to encourage\r\n      tillage. This double encouragement must they imagine, in a long period of\r\n      years, occasion such an increase in the production of corn, as may lower\r\n      its price in the home market, much more than the bounty can raise it in\r\n      the actual state which tillage may, at the end of that period, happen to\r\n      be in.\r\n\r\n      I answer, that whatever extension of the foreign market can be occasioned\r\n      by the bounty must, in every particular year, be altogether at the expense\r\n      of the home market; as every bushel of corn, which is exported by means of\r\n      the bounty, and which would not have been exported without the bounty,\r\n      would have remained in the home market to increase the consumption, and to\r\n      lower the price of that commodity. The corn bounty, it is to be observed,\r\n      as well as every other bounty upon exportation, imposes two different\r\n      taxes upon the people; first, the tax which they are obliged to\r\n      contribute, in order to pay the bounty; and, secondly, the tax which\r\n      arises from the advanced price of the commodity in the home market, and\r\n      which, as the whole body of the people are purchasers of corn, must, in\r\n      this particular commodity, be paid by the whole body of the people. In\r\n      this particular commodity, therefore, this second tax is by much the\r\n      heaviest of the two. Let us suppose that, taking one year with another,\r\n      the bounty of 5s. upon the exportation of the quarter of wheat raises the\r\n      price of that commodity in the home market only 6d. the bushel, or 4s. the\r\n      quarter higher than it otherwise would have been in the actual state of\r\n      the crop. Even upon this very moderate supposition, the great body of the\r\n      people, over and above contributing the tax which pays the bounty of 5s.\r\n      upon every quarter of wheat exported, must pay another of 4s. upon every\r\n      quarter which they themselves consume. But according to the very well\r\n      informed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, the average proportion\r\n      of the corn exported to that consumed at home, is not more than that of\r\n      one to thirty-one. For every 5s. therefore, which they contribute to the\r\n      payment of the first tax, they must contribute £6:4s. to the payment of\r\n      the second. So very heavy a tax upon the first necessary of life-must\r\n      either reduce the subsistence of the labouring poor, or it must occasion\r\n      some augmentation in their pecuniary wages, proportionable to that in the\r\n      pecuniary price of their subsistence. So far as it operates in the one\r\n      way, it must reduce the ability of the labouring poor to educate and bring\r\n      up their children, and must, so far, tend to restrain the population of\r\n      the country. So far as it operates in the other, it must reduce the\r\n      ability of the employers of the poor, to employ so great a number as they\r\n      otherwise might do, and must so far tend to restrain the industry of the\r\n      country. The extraordinary exportation of corn, therefore occasioned by\r\n      the bounty, not only in every particular year diminishes the home, just as\r\n      much as it extends the foreign market and consumption, but, by restraining\r\n      the population and industry of the country, its final tendency is to stint\r\n      and restrain the gradual extension of the home market; and thereby, in the\r\n      long-run, rather to diminish than to augment the whole market and\r\n      consumption of corn.\r\n\r\n      This enhancement of the money price of corn, however, it has been thought,\r\n      by rendering that commodity more profitable to the farmer, must\r\n      necessarily encourage its production.\r\n\r\n      I answer, that this might be the case, if the effect of the bounty was to\r\n      raise the real price of corn, or to enable the farmer, with an equal\r\n      quantity of it, to maintain a greater number of labourers in the same\r\n      manner, whether liberal, moderate, or scanty, than other labourers are\r\n      commonly maintained in his neighbourhood. But neither the bounty, it is\r\n      evident, nor any other human institution, can have any such effect. It is\r\n      not the real, but the nominal price of corn, which can in any considerable\r\n      degree be affected by the bounty. And though the tax, which that\r\n      institution imposes upon the whole body of the people, may be very\r\n      burdensome to those who pay it, it is of very little advantage to those\r\n      who receive it.\r\n\r\n      The real effect of the bounty is not so much to raise the real value of\r\n      corn, as to degrade the real value of silver; or to make an equal quantity\r\n      of it exchange for a smaller quantity, not only of corn, but of all other\r\n      home made commodities; for the money price of corn regulates that of all\r\n      other home made commodities.\r\n\r\n      It regulates the money price of labour, which must always be such as to\r\n      enable the labourer to purchase a quantity of corn sufficient to maintain\r\n      him and his family, either in the liberal, moderate, or scanty manner, in\r\n      which the advancing, stationary, or declining, circumstances of the\r\n      society, oblige his employers to maintain him.\r\n\r\n      It regulates the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of\r\n      land, which, in every period of improvement, must bear a certain\r\n      proportion to that of corn, though this proportion is different in\r\n      different periods. It regulates, for example, the money price of grass and\r\n      hay, of butcher’s meat, of horses, and the maintenance of horses, of land\r\n      carriage consequently, or of the greater part of the inland commerce of\r\n      the country.\r\n\r\n      By regulating the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce\r\n      of land, it regulates that of the materials of almost all manufactures; by\r\n      regulating the money price of labour, it regulates that of manufacturing\r\n      art and industry; and by regulating both, it regulates that of the\r\n      complete manufacture. The money price of labour, and of every thing that\r\n      is the produce, either of land or labour, must necessarily either rise or\r\n      fall in proportion to the money price of corn.\r\n\r\n      Though in consequence of the bounty, therefore, the farmer should be\r\n      enabled to sell his corn for 4s. the bushel, instead of 3s:6d. and to pay\r\n      his landlord a money rent proportionable to this rise in the money price\r\n      of his produce; yet if, in consequence of this rise in the price of corn,\r\n      4s. will purchase no more home made goods of any other kind than 3s. 6d.\r\n      would have done before, neither the circumstances of the farmer, nor those\r\n      of the landlord, will be much mended by this change. The farmer will not\r\n      be able to cultivate much better; the landlord will not be able to live\r\n      much better. In the purchase of foreign commodities, this enhancement in\r\n      the price of corn may give them some little advantage. In that of home\r\n      made commodities, it can give them none at all. And almost the whole\r\n      expense of the farmer, and the far greater part even of that of the\r\n      landlord, is in home made commodities.\r\n\r\n      That degradation in the value of silver, which is the effect of the\r\n      fertility of the mines, and which operates equally, or very nearly\r\n      equally, through the greater part of the commercial world, is a matter of\r\n      very little consequence to any particular country. The consequent rise of\r\n      all money prices, though it does not make those who receive them really\r\n      richer, does not make them really poorer. A service of plate becomes\r\n      really cheaper, and every thing else remains precisely of the same real\r\n      value as before.\r\n\r\n      But that degradation in the value of silver, which, being the effect\r\n      either of the peculiar situation or of the political institutions of a\r\n      particular country, takes place only in that country, is a matter of very\r\n      great consequence, which, far from tending to make anybody really richer,\r\n      tends to make every body really poorer. The rise in the money price of all\r\n      commodities, which is in this case peculiar to that country, tends to\r\n      discourage more or less every sort of industry which is carried on within\r\n      it, and to enable foreign nations, by furnishing almost all sorts of goods\r\n      for a smaller quantity of silver than its own workmen can afford to do, to\r\n      undersell them, not only in the foreign, but even in the home market.\r\n\r\n      It is the peculiar situation of Spain and Portugal, as proprietors of the\r\n      mines, to be the distributers of gold and silver to all the other\r\n      countries of Europe. Those metals ought naturally, therefore, to be\r\n      somewhat cheaper in Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe.\r\n      The difference, however, should be no more than the amount of the freight\r\n      and insurance; and, on account of the great value and small bulk of those\r\n      metals, their freight is no great matter, and their insurance is the same\r\n      as that of any other goods of equal value. Spain and Portugal, therefore,\r\n      could suffer very little from their peculiar situation, if they did not\r\n      aggravate its disadvantages by their political institutions.\r\n\r\n      Spain by taxing, and Portugal by prohibiting, the exportation of gold and\r\n      silver, load that exportation with the expense of smuggling, and raise the\r\n      value of those metals in other countries so much more above what it is in\r\n      their own, by the whole amount of this expense. When you dam up a stream\r\n      of water, as soon as the dam is full, as much water must run over the\r\n      dam-head as if there was no dam at all. The prohibition of exportation\r\n      cannot detain a greater quantity of gold and silver in Spain and Portugal,\r\n      than what they can afford to employ, than what the annual produce of their\r\n      land and labour will allow them to employ, in coin, plate, gilding, and\r\n      other ornaments of gold and silver. When they have got this quantity, the\r\n      dam is full, and the whole stream which flows in afterwards must run over.\r\n      The annual exportation of gold and silver from Spain and Portugal,\r\n      accordingly, is, by all accounts, notwithstanding these restraints, very\r\n      near equal to the whole annual importation. As the water, however, must\r\n      always be deeper behind the dam-head than before it, so the quantity of\r\n      gold and silver which these restraints detain in Spain and Portugal, must,\r\n      in proportion to the annual produce of their land and labour, be greater\r\n      than what is to be found in other countries. The higher and stronger the\r\n      dam-head, the greater must be the difference in the depth of water behind\r\n      and before it. The higher the tax, the higher the penalties with which the\r\n      prohibition is guarded, the more vigilant and severe the police which\r\n      looks after the execution of the law, the greater must be the difference\r\n      in the proportion of gold and silver to the annual produce of the land and\r\n      labour of Spain and Portugal, and to that of other countries. It is said,\r\n      accordingly, to be very considerable, and that you frequently find there a\r\n      profusion of plate in houses, where there is nothing else which would in\r\n      other countries be thought suitable or correspondent to this sort of\r\n      magnificence. The cheapness of gold and silver, or, what is the same\r\n      thing, the dearness of all commodities, which is the necessary effect of\r\n      this redundancy of the precious metals, discourages both the agriculture\r\n      and manufactures of Spain and Portugal, and enables foreign nations to\r\n      supply them with many sorts of rude, and with almost all sorts of\r\n      manufactured produce, for a smaller quantity of gold and silver than what\r\n      they themselves can either raise or make them for at home. The tax and\r\n      prohibition operate in two different ways. They not only lower very much\r\n      the value of the precious metals in Spain and Portugal, but by detaining\r\n      there a certain quantity of those metals which would otherwise flow over\r\n      other countries, they keep up their value in those other countries\r\n      somewhat above what it otherwise would be, and thereby give those\r\n      countries a double advantage in their commerce with Spain and Portugal.\r\n      Open the flood-gates, and there will presently be less water above, and\r\n      more below the dam-head, and it will soon come to a level in both places.\r\n      Remove the tax and the prohibition, and as the quantity of gold and silver\r\n      will diminish considerably in Spain and Portugal, so it will increase\r\n      somewhat in other countries; and the value of those metals, their\r\n      proportion to the annual produce of land and labour, will soon come to a\r\n      level, or very near to a level, in all. The loss which Spain and Portugal\r\n      could sustain by this exportation of their gold and silver, would be\r\n      altogether nominal and imaginary. The nominal value of their goods, and of\r\n      the annual produce of their land and labour, would fall, and would be\r\n      expressed or represented by a smaller quantity of silver than before; but\r\n      their real value would be the same as before, and would be sufficient to\r\n      maintain, command, and employ the same quantity of labour. As the nominal\r\n      value of their goods would fall, the real value of what remained of their\r\n      gold and silver would rise, and a smaller quantity of those metals would\r\n      answer all the same purposes of commerce and circulation which had\r\n      employed a greater quantity before. The gold and silver which would go\r\n      abroad would not go abroad for nothing, but would bring back an equal\r\n      value of goods of some kind or other. Those goods, too, would not be all\r\n      matters of mere luxury and expense, to be consumed by idle people, who\r\n      produce nothing in return for their consumption. As the real wealth and\r\n      revenue of idle people would not be augmented by this extraordinary\r\n      exportation of gold and silver, so neither would their consumption be much\r\n      augmented by it. Those goods would probably, the greater part of them, and\r\n      certainly some part of them, consist in materials, tools, and provisions,\r\n      for the employment and maintenance of industrious people, who would\r\n      reproduce, with a profit, the full value of their consumption. A part of\r\n      the dead stock of the society would thus be turned into active stock, and\r\n      would put into motion a greater quantity of industry than had been\r\n      employed before. The annual produce of their land and labour would\r\n      immediately be augmented a little, and in a few years would probably be\r\n      augmented a great deal; their industry being thus relieved from one of the\r\n      most oppressive burdens which it at present labours under.\r\n\r\n      The bounty upon the exportation of corn necessarily operates exactly in\r\n      the same way as this absurd policy of Spain and Portugal. Whatever be the\r\n      actual state of tillage, it renders our corn somewhat dearer in the home\r\n      market than it otherwise would be in that state, and somewhat cheaper in\r\n      the foreign; and as the average money price of corn regulates, more or\r\n      less, that of all other commodities, it lowers the value of silver\r\n      considerably in the one, and tends to raise it a little in the other. It\r\n      enables foreigners, the Dutch in particular, not only to eat our corn\r\n      cheaper than they otherwise could do, but sometimes to eat it cheaper than\r\n      even our own people can do upon the same occasions; as we are assured by\r\n      an excellent authority, that of Sir Matthew Decker. It hinders our own\r\n      workmen from furnishing their goods for so small a quantity of silver as\r\n      they otherwise might do, and enables the Dutch to furnish theirs for a\r\n      smaller. It tends to render our manufactures somewhat dearer in every\r\n      market, and theirs somewhat cheaper, than they otherwise would be, and\r\n      consequently to give their industry a double advantage over our own.\r\n\r\n      The bounty, as it raises in the home market, not so much the real, as the\r\n      nominal price of our corn; as it augments, not the quantity of labour\r\n      which a certain quantity of corn can maintain and employ, but only the\r\n      quantity of silver which it will exchange for; it discourages our\r\n      manufactures, without rendering any considerable service, either to our\r\n      farmers or country gentlemen. It puts, indeed, a little more money into\r\n      the pockets of both, and it will perhaps be somewhat difficult to persuade\r\n      the greater part of them that this is not rendering them a very\r\n      considerable service. But if this money sinks in its value, in the\r\n      quantity of labour, provisions, and home-made commodities of all different\r\n      kinds which it is capable of purchasing, as much as it rises in its\r\n      quantity, the service will be little more than nominal and imaginary.\r\n\r\n      There is, perhaps, but one set of men in the whole commonwealth to whom\r\n      the bounty either was or could be essentially serviceable. These were the\r\n      corn merchants, the exporters and importers of corn. In years of plenty,\r\n      the bounty necessarily occasioned a greater exportation than would\r\n      otherwise have taken place; and by hindering the plenty of the one year\r\n      from relieving the scarcity of another, it occasioned in years of scarcity\r\n      a greater importation than would otherwise have been necessary. It\r\n      increased the business of the corn merchant in both; and in the years of\r\n      scarcity, it not only enabled him to import a greater quantity, but to\r\n      sell it for a better price, and consequently with a greater profit, than\r\n      he could otherwise have made, if the plenty of one year had not been more\r\n      or less hindered from relieving the scarcity of another. It is in this set\r\n      of men, accordingly, that I have observed the greatest zeal for the\r\n      continuance or renewal of the bounty.\r\n\r\n      Our country gentlemen, when they imposed the high duties upon the\r\n      exportation of foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a\r\n      prohibition, and when they established the bounty, seem to have imitated\r\n      the conduct of our manufacturers. By the one institution, they secured to\r\n      themselves the monopoly of the home market, and by the other they\r\n      endeavoured to prevent that market from ever being overstocked with their\r\n      commodity. By both they endeavoured to raise its real value, in the same\r\n      manner as our manufacturers had, by the like institutions, raised the real\r\n      value of many different sorts of manufactured goods. They did not,\r\n      perhaps, attend to the great and essential difference which nature has\r\n      established between corn and almost every other sort of goods. When,\r\n      either by the monopoly of the home market, or by a bounty upon\r\n      exportation, you enable our woollen or linen manufacturers to sell their\r\n      goods for somewhat a better price than they otherwise could get for them,\r\n      you raise, not only the nominal, but the real price of those goods; you\r\n      render them equivalent to a greater quantity of labour and subsistence;\r\n      you increase not only the nominal, but the real profit, the real wealth\r\n      and revenue of those manufacturers; and you enable them, either to live\r\n      better themselves, or to employ a greater quantity of labour in those\r\n      particular manufactures. You really encourage those manufactures, and\r\n      direct towards them a greater quantity of the industry of the country than\r\n      what would properly go to them of its own accord. But when, by the like\r\n      institutions, you raise the nominal or money price of corn, you do not\r\n      raise its real value; you do not increase the real wealth, the real\r\n      revenue, either of our farmers or country gentlemen; you do not encourage\r\n      the growth of corn, because you do not enable them to maintain and employ\r\n      more labourers in raising it. The nature of things has stamped upon corn a\r\n      real value, which cannot be altered by merely altering its money price. No\r\n      bounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the home market, can raise that\r\n      value. The freest competition cannot lower it, Through the world in\r\n      general, that value is equal to the quantity of labour which it can\r\n      maintain, and in every particular place it is equal to the quantity of\r\n      labour which it can maintain in the way, whether liberal, moderate, or\r\n      scanty, in which labour is commonly maintained in that place. Woollen or\r\n      linen cloth are not the regulating commodities by which the real value of\r\n      all other commodities must be finally measured and determined; corn is.\r\n      The real value of every other commodity is finally measured and determined\r\n      by the proportion which its average money price bears to the average money\r\n      price of corn. The real value of corn does not vary with those variations\r\n      in its average money price, which sometimes occur from one century to\r\n      another; it is the real value of silver which varies with them.\r\n\r\n      Bounties upon the exportation of any homemade commodity are liable, first,\r\n      to that general objection which may be made to all the different\r\n      expedients of the mercantile system; the objection of forcing some part of\r\n      the industry of the country into a channel less advantageous than that in\r\n      which it would run of its own accord; and, secondly, to the particular\r\n      objection of forcing it not only into a channel that is less advantageous,\r\n      but into one that is actually disadvantageous; the trade which cannot be\r\n      carried on but by means of a bounty being necessarily a losing trade. The\r\n      bounty upon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection,\r\n      that it can in no respect promote the raising of that particular commodity\r\n      of which it was meant to encourage the production. When our country\r\n      gentlemen, therefore, demanded the establishment of the bounty, though\r\n      they acted in imitation of our merchants and manufacturers, they did not\r\n      act with that complete comprehension of their own interest, which commonly\r\n      directs the conduct of those two other orders of people. They loaded the\r\n      public revenue with a very considerable expense: they imposed a very heavy\r\n      tax upon the whole body of the people; but they did not, in any sensible\r\n      degree, increase the real value of their own commodity; and by lowering\r\n      somewhat the real value of silver, they discouraged, in some degree, the\r\n      general industry of the country, and, instead of advancing, retarded more\r\n      or less the improvement of their own lands, which necessarily depend upon\r\n      the general industry of the country.\r\n\r\n      To encourage the production of any commodity, a bounty upon production,\r\n      one should imagine, would have a more direct operation than one upon\r\n      exportation. It would, besides, impose only one tax upon the people, that\r\n      which they must contribute in order to pay the bounty. Instead of raising,\r\n      it would tend to lower the price of the commodity in the home market; and\r\n      thereby, instead of imposing a second tax upon the people, it might, at\r\n      least in part, repay them for what they had contributed to the first.\r\n      Bounties upon production, however, have been very rarely granted. The\r\n      prejudices established by the commercial system have taught us to believe,\r\n      that national wealth arises more immediately from exportation than from\r\n      production. It has been more favoured, accordingly, as the more immediate\r\n      means of bringing money into the country. Bounties upon production, it has\r\n      been said too, have been found by experience more liable to frauds than\r\n      those upon exportation. How far this is true, I know not. That bounties\r\n      upon exportation have been abused, to many fraudulent purposes, is very\r\n      well known. But it is not the interest of merchants and manufacturers, the\r\n      great inventors of all these expedients, that the home market should be\r\n      overstocked with their goods; an event which a bounty upon production\r\n      might sometimes occasion. A bounty upon exportation, by enabling them to\r\n      send abroad their surplus part, and to keep up the price of what remains\r\n      in the home market, effectually prevents this. Of all the expedients of\r\n      the mercantile system, accordingly, it is the one of which they are the\r\n      fondest. I have known the different undertakers of some particular works\r\n      agree privately among themselves to give a bounty out of their own pockets\r\n      upon the exportation of a certain proportion of the goods which they dealt\r\n      in. This expedient succeeded so well, that it more than doubled the price\r\n      of their goods in the home market, notwithstanding a very considerable\r\n      increase in the produce. The operation of the bounty upon corn must have\r\n      been wonderfully different, if it has lowered the money price of that\r\n      commodity.\r\n\r\n      Something like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted upon\r\n      some particular occasions. The tonnage bounties given to the white herring\r\n      and whale fisheries may, perhaps, be considered as somewhat of this\r\n      nature. They tend directly, it may be supposed, to render the goods\r\n      cheaper in the home market than they otherwise would be. In other\r\n      respects, their effects, it must be acknowledged, are the same as those of\r\n      bounties upon exportation. By means of them, a part of the capital of the\r\n      country is employed in bringing goods to market, of which the price does\r\n      not repay the cost, together with the ordinary profits of stock.\r\n\r\n      But though the tonnage bounties to those fisheries do not contribute to\r\n      the opulence of the nation, it may, perhaps, be thought that they\r\n      contribute to its defence, by augmenting the number of its sailors and\r\n      shipping. This, it may be alleged, may sometimes be done by means of such\r\n      bounties, at a much smaller expense than by keeping up a great standing\r\n      navy, if I may use such an expression, in the same way as a standing army.\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding these favourable allegations, however, the following\r\n      considerations dispose me to believe, that in granting at least one of\r\n      these bounties, the legislature has been very grossly imposed upon:\r\n\r\n      First, The herring-buss bounty seems too large.\r\n\r\n      From the commencement of the winter fishing 1771, to the end of the winter\r\n      fishing 1781, the tonnage bounty upon the herring-buss fishery has been at\r\n      thirty shillings the ton. During these eleven years, the whole number of\r\n      barrels caught by the herring-buss fishery of Scotland amounted to\r\n      378,347. The herrings caught and cured at sea are called sea-sticks. In\r\n      order to render them what are called merchantable herrings, it is\r\n      necessary to repack them with an additional quantity of salt; and in this\r\n      case, it is reckoned, that three barrels of sea-sticks are usually\r\n      repacked into two barrels of merchantable herrings. The number of barrels\r\n      of merchantable herrings, therefore, caught during these eleven years,\r\n      will amount only, according to this account, to 252,231¼. During these\r\n      eleven years, the tonnage bounties paid amounted to £155,463:11s. or\r\n      8s:2¼d. upon every barrel of sea-sticks, and to 12s:3¾d. upon every barrel\r\n      of merchantable herrings.\r\n\r\n      The salt with which these herrings are cured is sometimes Scotch, and\r\n      sometimes foreign salt; both which are delivered, free of all excise duty,\r\n      to the fish-curers. The excise duty upon Scotch salt is at present 1s:6d.,\r\n      that upon foreign salt 10s. the bushel. A barrel of herrings is supposed\r\n      to require about one bushel and one-fourth of a bushel foreign salt. Two\r\n      bushels are the supposed average of Scotch salt. If the herrings are\r\n      entered for exportation, no part of this duty is paid up; if entered for\r\n      home consumption, whether the herrings were cured with foreign or with\r\n      Scotch salt, only one shilling the barrel is paid up. It was the old\r\n      Scotch duty upon a bushel of salt, the quantity which, at a low\r\n      estimation, had been supposed necessary for curing a barrel of herrings.\r\n      In Scotland, foreign salt is very little used for any other purpose but\r\n      the curing of fish. But from the 5th April 1771 to the 5th April 1782, the\r\n      quantity of foreign salt imported amounted to 936,974 bushels, at\r\n      eighty-four pounds the bushel; the quantity of Scotch salt delivered from\r\n      the works to the fish-curers, to no more than 168,226, at fifty-six pounds\r\n      the bushel only. It would appear, therefore, that it is principally\r\n      foreign salt that is used in the fisheries. Upon every barrel of herrings\r\n      exported, there is, besides, a bounty of 2s:8d. and more than two-thirds\r\n      of the buss-caught herrings are exported. Put all these things together,\r\n      and you will find that, during these eleven years, every barrel of\r\n      buss-caught herrings, cured with Scotch salt, when exported, has cost\r\n      government 17s:11¾d.; and, when entered for home consumption, 14s:3¾d.;\r\n      and that every barrel cured with foreign salt, when exported, has cost\r\n      government £1:7:5¾d.; and, when entered for home consumption, £1:3:9¾d.\r\n      The price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings runs from seventeen\r\n      and eighteen to four and five-and-twenty shillings; about a guinea at an\r\n      average. {See the accounts at the end of this Book.}\r\n\r\n      Secondly, The bounty to the white-herring fishery is a tonnage bounty, and\r\n      is proportioned to the burden of the ship, not to her diligence or success\r\n      in the fishery; and it has, I am afraid, been too common for the vessels\r\n      to fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish but the bounty.\r\n      In the year 1759, when the bounty was at fifty shillings the ton, the\r\n      whole buss fishery of Scotland brought in only four barrels of sea-sticks.\r\n      In that year, each barrel of sea-sticks cost government, in bounties\r\n      alone, £113:15s.; each barrel of merchantable herrings £159:7:6.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, The mode of fishing, for which this tonnage bounty in the white\r\n      herring fishery has been given (by busses or decked vessels from twenty to\r\n      eighty tons burden ), seems not so well adapted to the situation of\r\n      Scotland, as to that of Holland, from the practice of which country it\r\n      appears to have been borrowed. Holland lies at a great distance from the\r\n      seas to which herrings are known principally to resort, and can,\r\n      therefore, carry on that fishery only in decked vessels, which can carry\r\n      water and provisions sufficient for a voyage to a distant sea; but the\r\n      Hebrides, or Western Islands, the islands of Shetland, and the northern\r\n      and north-western coasts of Scotland, the countries in whose neighbourhood\r\n      the herring fishery is principally carried on, are everywhere intersected\r\n      by arms of the sea, which run up a considerable way into the land, and\r\n      which, in the language of the country, are called sea-lochs. It is to\r\n      these sea-lochs that the herrings principally resort during the seasons in\r\n      which they visit these seas; for the visits of this, and, I am assured, of\r\n      many other sorts of fish, are not quite regular and constant. A\r\n      boat-fishery, therefore, seems to be the mode of fishing best adapted to\r\n      the peculiar situation of Scotland, the fishers carrying the herrings on\r\n      shore as fast as they are taken, to be either cured or consumed fresh. But\r\n      the great encouragement which a bounty of 30s. the ton gives to the\r\n      buss-fishery, is necessarily a discouragement to the boat-fishery, which,\r\n      having no such bounty, cannot bring its cured fish to market upon the same\r\n      terms as the buss-fishery. The boat-fishery; accordingly, which, before\r\n      the establishment of the buss-bounty, was very considerable, and is said\r\n      to have employed a number of seamen, not inferior to what the buss-fishery\r\n      employs at present, is now gone almost entirely to decay. Of the former\r\n      extent, however, of this now ruined and abandoned fishery, I must\r\n      acknowledge that I cannot pretend to speak with much precision. As no\r\n      bounty was-paid upon the outfit of the boat-fishery, no account was taken\r\n      of it by the officers of the customs or salt duties.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, In many parts of Scotland, during certain seasons of the year,\r\n      herrings make no inconsiderable part of the food of the common people. A\r\n      bounty which tended to lower their price in the home market, might\r\n      contribute a good deal to the relief of a great number of our\r\n      fellow-subjects, whose circumstances are by no means affluent. But the\r\n      herring-bus bounty contributes to no such good purpose. It has ruined the\r\n      boat fishery, which is by far the best adapted for the supply of the home\r\n      market; and the additional bounty of 2s:8d. the barrel upon exportation,\r\n      carries the greater part, more than two-thirds, of the produce of the\r\n      buss-fishery abroad. Between thirty and forty years ago, before the\r\n      establishment of the buss-bounty, 16s. the barrel, I have been assured,\r\n      was the common price of white herrings. Between ten and fifteen years ago,\r\n      before the boat-fishery was entirely ruined, the price was said to have\r\n      run from seventeen to twenty shillings the barrel. For these last five\r\n      years, it has, at an average, been at twenty-five shillings the barrel.\r\n      This high price, however, may have been owing to the real scarcity of the\r\n      herrings upon the coast of Scotland. I must observe, too, that the cask or\r\n      barrel, which is usually sold with the herrings, and of which the price is\r\n      included in all the foregoing prices, has, since the commencement of the\r\n      American war, risen to about double its former price, or from about 3s. to\r\n      about 6s. I must likewise observe, that the accounts I have received of\r\n      the prices of former times, have been by no means quite uniform and\r\n      consistent, and an old man of great accuracy and experience has assured\r\n      me, that, more than fifty years ago, a guinea was the usual price of a\r\n      barrel of good merchantable herrings; and this, I imagine, may still be\r\n      looked upon as the average price. All accounts, however, I think, agree\r\n      that the price has not been lowered in the home market in consequence of\r\n      the buss-bounty.\r\n\r\n      When the undertakers of fisheries, after such liberal bounties have been\r\n      bestowed upon them, continue to sell their commodity at the same, or even\r\n      at a higher price than they were accustomed to do before, it might be\r\n      expected that their profits should be very great; and it is not improbable\r\n      that those of some individuals may have been so. In general, however, I\r\n      have every reason to believe they have been quite otherwise. The usual\r\n      effect of such bounties is, to encourage rash undertakers to adventure in\r\n      a business which they do not understand; and what they lose by their own\r\n      negligence and ignorance, more than compensates all that they can gain by\r\n      the utmost liberality of government. In 1750, by the same act which first\r\n      gave the bounty of 30s. the ton for the encouragement of the white herring\r\n      fishery (the 23d Geo. II. chap. 24), a joint stock company was erected,\r\n      with a capital of £500,000, to which the subscribers (over and above all\r\n      other encouragements, the tonnage bounty just now mentioned, the\r\n      exportation bounty of 2s:8d. the barrel, the delivery of both British and\r\n      foreign salt duty free) were, during the space of fourteen years, for\r\n      every hundred pounds which they subscribed and paid into the stock of the\r\n      society, entitled to three pounds a-year, to be paid by the\r\n      receiver-general of the customs in equal half-yearly payments. Besides\r\n      this great company, the residence of whose governor and directors was to\r\n      be in London, it was declared lawful to erect different fishing chambers\r\n      in all the different out-ports of the kingdom, provided a sum not less\r\n      than £10,000 was subscribed into the capital of each, to be managed at its\r\n      own risk, and for its own profit and loss. The same annuity, and the same\r\n      encouragements of all kinds, were given to the trade of those inferior\r\n      chambers as to that of the great company. The subscription of the great\r\n      company was soon filled up, and several different fishing chambers were\r\n      erected in the different out-ports of the kingdom. In spite of all these\r\n      encouragements, almost all those different companies, both great and\r\n      small, lost either the whole or the greater part of their capitals; scarce\r\n      a vestige now remains of any of them, and the white-herring fishery is now\r\n      entirely, or almost entirely, carried on by private adventurers.\r\n\r\n      If any particular manufacture was necessary, indeed, for the defence of\r\n      the society, it might not always be prudent to depend upon our neighbours\r\n      for the supply; and if such manufacture could not otherwise be supported\r\n      at home, it might not be unreasonable that all the other branches of\r\n      industry should be taxed in order to support it. The bounties upon the\r\n      exportation of British made sail-cloth, and British made gunpowder, may,\r\n      perhaps, both be vindicated upon this principle.\r\n\r\n      But though it can very seldom be reasonable to tax the industry of the\r\n      great body of the people, in order to support that of some particular\r\n      class of manufacturers; yet, in the wantonness of great prosperity, when\r\n      the public enjoys a greater revenue than it knows well what to do with, to\r\n      give such bounties to favourite manufactures, may, perhaps, be as natural\r\n      as to incur any other idle expense. In public, as well as in private\r\n      expenses, great wealth, may, perhaps, frequently be admitted as an apology\r\n      for great folly. But there must surely be something more than ordinary\r\n      absurdity in continuing such profusion in times of general difficulty and\r\n      distress.\r\n\r\n      What is called a bounty, is sometimes no more than a drawback, and,\r\n      consequently, is not liable to the same objections as what is properly a\r\n      bounty. The bounty, for example, upon refined sugar exported, may be\r\n      considered as a drawback of the duties upon the brown and Muscovado\r\n      sugars, from which it is made; the bounty upon wrought silk exported, a\r\n      drawback of the duties upon raw and thrown silk imported; the bounty upon\r\n      gunpowder exported, a drawback of the duties upon brimstone and saltpetre\r\n      imported. In the language of the customs, those allowances only are called\r\n      drawbacks which are given upon goods exported in the same form in which\r\n      they are imported. When that form has been so altered by manufacture of\r\n      any kind as to come under a new denomination, they are called bounties.\r\n\r\n      Premiums given by the public to artists and manufacturers, who excel in\r\n      their particular occupations, are not liable to the same objections as\r\n      bounties. By encouraging extraordinary dexterity and ingenuity, they serve\r\n      to keep up the emulation of the workmen actually employed in those\r\n      respective occupations, and are not considerable enough to turn towards\r\n      any one of them a greater share of the capital of the country than what\r\n      would go to it of its own accord. Their tendency is not to overturn the\r\n      natural balance of employments, but to render the work which is done in\r\n      each as perfect and complete as possible. The expense of premiums,\r\n      besides, is very trifling, that of bounties very great. The bounty upon\r\n      corn alone has sometimes cost the public, in one year, more than £300,000.\r\n\r\n      Bounties are sometimes called premiums, as drawbacks are sometimes called\r\n      bounties. But we must, in all cases, attend to the nature of the thing,\r\n      without paying any regard to the word.\r\n\r\n      Digression concerning the Corn Trade and Corn Laws.\r\n\r\n      I cannot conclude this chapter concerning bounties, without observing,\r\n      that the praises which have been bestowed upon the law which establishes\r\n      the bounty upon the exportation of corn, and upon that system of\r\n      regulations which is connected with it, are altogether unmerited. A\r\n      particular examination of the nature of the corn trade, and of the\r\n      principal British laws which relate to it, will sufficiently demonstrate\r\n      the truth of this assertion. The great importance of this subject must\r\n      justify the length of the digression.\r\n\r\n      The trade of the corn merchant is composed of four different branches,\r\n      which, though they may sometimes be all carried on by the same person,\r\n      are, in their own nature, four separate and distinct trades. These are,\r\n      first, the trade of the inland dealer; secondly, that of the\r\n      merchant-importer for home consumption; thirdly, that of the\r\n      merchant-exporter of home produce for foreign consumption; and, fourthly,\r\n      that of the merchant-carrier, or of the importer of corn, in order to\r\n      export it again.\r\n\r\n      I. The interest of the inland dealer, and that of the great body of the\r\n      people, how opposite soever they may at first appear, are, even in years\r\n      of the greatest scarcity, exactly the same. It is his interest to raise\r\n      the price of his corn as high as the real scarcity of the season\r\n      requires, and it can never be his interest to raise it higher. By raising\r\n      the price, he discourages the consumption, and puts every body more or\r\n      less, but particularly the inferior ranks of people, upon thrift and good\r\n      management. If, by raising it too high, he discourages the consumption so\r\n      much that the supply of the season is likely to go beyond the consumption\r\n      of the season, and to last for some time after the next crop begins to\r\n      come in, he runs the hazard, not only of losing a considerable part of\r\n      his corn by natural causes, but of being obliged to sell what remains of\r\n      it for much less than what he might have had for it several months\r\n      before. If, by not raising the price high enough, he discourages the\r\n      consumption so little, that the supply of the season is likely to fall\r\n      short of the consumption of the season, he not only loses a part of the\r\n      profit which he might otherwise have made, but he exposes the people to\r\n      suffer before the end of the season, instead of the hardships of a\r\n      dearth, the dreadful horrors of a famine. It is the interest of the\r\n      people that their daily, weekly, and monthly consumption should be\r\n      proportioned as exactly as possible to the supply of the season. The\r\n      interest of the inland corn dealer is the same. By supplying them, as\r\n      nearly as he can judge, in this proportion, he is likely to sell all his\r\n      corn for the highest price, and with the greatest profit; and his\r\n      knowledge of the state of the crop, and of his daily, weekly, and monthly\r\n      sales, enables him to judge, with more or less accuracy, how far they\r\n      really are supplied in this manner. Without intending the interest of the\r\n      people, he is necessarily led, by a regard to his own interest, to treat\r\n      them, even in years of scarcity, pretty much in the same manner as the\r\n      prudent master of a vessel is sometimes obliged to treat his crew. When\r\n      he foresees that provisions are likely to run short, he puts them upon\r\n      short allowance. Though from excess of caution he should sometimes do\r\n      this without any real necessity, yet all the inconveniencies which his\r\n      crew can thereby suffer are inconsiderable, in comparison of the danger,\r\n      misery, and ruin, to which they might sometimes be exposed by a less\r\n      provident conduct. Though, from excess of avarice, in the same manner,\r\n      the inland corn merchant should sometimes raise the price of his corn\r\n      somewhat higher than the scarcity of the season requires, yet all the\r\n      inconveniencies which the people can suffer from this conduct, which\r\n      effectually secures them from a famine in the end of the season, are\r\n      inconsiderable, in comparison of what they might have been exposed to by\r\n      a more liberal way of dealing in the beginning of it the corn merchant\r\n      himself is likely to suffer the most by this excess of avarice; not only\r\n      from the indignation which it generally excites against him, but, though\r\n      he should escape the effects of this indignation, from the quantity of\r\n      corn which it necessarily leaves upon his hands in the end of the season,\r\n      and which, if the next season happens to prove favourable, he must always\r\n      sell for a much lower price than he might otherwise have had.\r\n\r\n      Were it possible, indeed, for one great company of merchants to possess\r\n      themselves of the whole crop of an extensive country, it might perhaps be\r\n      their interest to deal with it, as the Dutch are said to do with the\r\n      spiceries of the Moluccas, to destroy or throw away a considerable part of\r\n      it, in order to keep up the price of the rest. But it is scarce possible,\r\n      even by the violence of law, to establish such an extensive monopoly with\r\n      regard to corn; and wherever the law leaves the trade free, it is of all\r\n      commodities the least liable to be engrossed or monopolised by the force\r\n      a few large capitals, which buy up the greater part of it. Not only its\r\n      value far exceeds what the capitals of a few private men are capable of\r\n      purchasing; but, supposing they were capable of purchasing it, the manner\r\n      in which it is produced renders this purchase altogether impracticable.\r\n      As, in every civilized country, it is the commodity of which the annual\r\n      consumption is the greatest; so a greater quantity of industry is annually\r\n      employed in producing corn than in producing any other commodity. When it\r\n      first comes from the ground, too, it is necessarily divided among a\r\n      greater number of owners than any other commodity; and these owners can\r\n      never be collected into one place, like a number of independent\r\n      manufacturers, but are necessarily scattered through all the different\r\n      corners of the country. These first owners either immediately supply the\r\n      consumers in their own neighbourhood, or they supply other inland dealers,\r\n      who supply those consumers. The inland dealers in corn, therefore,\r\n      including both the farmer and the baker, are necessarily more numerous\r\n      than the dealers in any other commodity; and their dispersed situation\r\n      renders it altogether impossible for them to enter into any general\r\n      combination. If, in a year of scarcity, therefore, any of them should find\r\n      that he had a good deal more corn upon hand than, at the current price, he\r\n      could hope to dispose of before the end of the season, he would never\r\n      think of keeping up this price to his own loss, and to the sole benefit of\r\n      his rivals and competitors, but would immediately lower it, in order to\r\n      get rid of his corn before the new crop began to come in. The same\r\n      motives, the same interests, which would thus regulate the conduct of any\r\n      one dealer, would regulate that of every other, and oblige them all in\r\n      general to sell their corn at the price which, according to the best of\r\n      their judgment, was most suitable to the scarcity or plenty of the season.\r\n\r\n      Whoever examines, with attention, the history of the dearths and famines\r\n      which have afflicted any part of Europe during either the course of the\r\n      present or that of the two preceding centuries, of several of which we\r\n      have pretty exact accounts, will find, I believe, that a dearth never has\r\n      arisen from any combination among the inland dealers in corn, nor from any\r\n      other cause but a real scarcity, occasioned sometimes, perhaps, and in\r\n      some particular places, by the waste of war, but in by far the greatest\r\n      number of cases by the fault of the seasons; and that a famine has never\r\n      arisen from any other cause but the violence of government attempting, by\r\n      improper means, to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth.\r\n\r\n      In an extensive corn country, between all the different parts of which\r\n      there is a free commerce and communication, the scarcity occasioned by the\r\n      most unfavourable seasons can never be so great as to produce a famine;\r\n      and the scantiest crop, if managed with frugality and economy, will\r\n      maintain, through the year, the same number of people that are commonly\r\n      fed in a more affluent manner by one of moderate plenty. The seasons most\r\n      unfavourable to the crop are those of excessive drought or excessive rain.\r\n      But as corn grows equally upon high and low lands, upon grounds that are\r\n      disposed to be too wet, and upon those that are disposed to be too dry,\r\n      either the drought or the rain, which is hurtful to one part of the\r\n      country, is favourable to another; and though, both in the wet and in the\r\n      dry season, the crop is a good deal less than in one more properly\r\n      tempered; yet, in both, what is lost in one part of the country is in some\r\n      measure compensated by what is gained in the other. In rice countries,\r\n      where the crop not only requires a very moist soil, but where, in a\r\n      certain period of its growing, it must be laid under water, the effects of\r\n      a drought are much more dismal. Even in such countries, however, the\r\n      drought is, perhaps, scarce ever so universal as necessarily to occasion a\r\n      famine, if the government would allow a free trade. The drought in Bengal,\r\n      a few years ago, might probably have occasioned a very great dearth. Some\r\n      improper regulations, some injudicious restraints, imposed by the servants\r\n      of the East India Company upon the rice trade, contributed, perhaps, to\r\n      turn that dearth into a famine.\r\n\r\n      When the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth,\r\n      orders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it supposes a reasonable\r\n      price, it either hinders them from bringing it to market, which may\r\n      sometimes produce a famine even in the beginning of the season; or, if\r\n      they bring it thither, it enables the people, and thereby encourages them\r\n      to consume it so fast as must necessarily produce a famine before the end\r\n      of the season. The unlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade, as\r\n      it is the only effectual preventive of the miseries of a famine, so it is\r\n      the best palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth; for the\r\n      inconveniencies of a real scarcity cannot be remedied; they can only be\r\n      palliated. No trade deserves more the full protection of the law, and no\r\n      trade requires it so much; because no trade is so much exposed to popular\r\n      odium.\r\n\r\n      In years of scarcity, the inferior ranks of people impute their distress\r\n      to the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the object of their\r\n      hatred and indignation. Instead of making profit upon such occasions,\r\n      therefore, he is often in danger of being utterly ruined, and of having\r\n      his magazines plundered and destroyed by their violence. It is in years of\r\n      scarcity, however, when prices are high, that the corn merchant expects to\r\n      make his principal profit. He is generally in contract with some farmers\r\n      to furnish him, for a certain number of years, with a certain quantity of\r\n      corn, at a certain price. This contract price is settled according to what\r\n      is supposed to be the moderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or\r\n      average price, which, before the late years of scarcity, was commonly\r\n      about 28s. for the quarter of wheat, and for that of other grain in\r\n      proportion. In years of scarcity, therefore, the corn merchant buys a\r\n      great part of his corn for the ordinary price, and sells it for a much\r\n      higher. That this extraordinary profit, however, is no more than\r\n      sufficient to put his trade upon a fair level with other trades, and to\r\n      compensate the many losses which he sustains upon other occasions, both\r\n      from the perishable nature of the commodity itself, and from the frequent\r\n      and unforeseen fluctuations of its price, seems evident enough, from this\r\n      single circumstance, that great fortunes are as seldom made in this as in\r\n      any other trade. The popular odium, however, which attends it in years of\r\n      scarcity, the only years in which it can be very profitable, renders\r\n      people of character and fortune averse to enter into it. It is abandoned\r\n      to an inferior set of dealers; and millers, bakers, meal-men, and\r\n      meal-factors, together with a number of wretched hucksters, are almost the\r\n      only middle people that, in the home market, come between the grower and\r\n      the consumer.\r\n\r\n      The ancient policy of Europe, instead of discountenancing this popular\r\n      odium against a trade so beneficial to the public, seems, on the contrary,\r\n      to have authorised and encouraged it.\r\n\r\n      By the 5th and 6th of Edward VI cap. 14, it was enacted, that whoever\r\n      should buy any corn or grain, with intent to sell it again, should be\r\n      reputed an unlawful engrosser, and should, for the first fault, suffer two\r\n      months imprisonment, and forfeit the value of the corn; for the second,\r\n      suffer six months imprisonment, and forfeit double the value; and, for the\r\n      third, be set in the pillory, suffer imprisonment during the king’s\r\n      pleasure, and forfeit all his goods and chattels. The ancient policy of\r\n      most other parts of Europe was no better than that of England.\r\n\r\n      Our ancestors seem to have imagined, that the people would buy their corn\r\n      cheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant, who, they were afraid,\r\n      would require, over and above the price which he paid to the farmer, an\r\n      exorbitant profit to himself. They endeavoured, therefore, to annihilate\r\n      his trade altogether. They even endeavoured to hinder, as much as\r\n      possible, any middle man of any kind from coming in between the grower and\r\n      the consumer; and this was the meaning of the many restraints which they\r\n      imposed upon the trade of those whom they called kidders, or carriers of\r\n      corn; a trade which nobody was allowed to exercise without a licence,\r\n      ascertaining his qualifications as a man of probity and fair dealing. The\r\n      authority of three justices of the peace was, by the statute of Edward VI.\r\n      necessary in order to grant this licence. But even this restraint was\r\n      afterwards thought insufficient, and, by a statute of Elizabeth, the\r\n      privilege of granting it was confined to the quarter-sessions.\r\n\r\n      The ancient policy of Europe endeavoured, in this manner, to regulate\r\n      agriculture, the great trade of the country, by maxims quite different\r\n      from those which it established with regard to manufactures, the great\r\n      trade of the towns. By leaving a farmer no other customers but either the\r\n      consumers or their immediate factors, the kidders and carriers of corn, it\r\n      endeavoured to force him to exercise the trade, not only of a farmer, but\r\n      of a corn merchant, or corn retailer. On the contrary, it, in many cases,\r\n      prohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a shopkeeper, or\r\n      from selling his own goods by retail. It meant, by the one law, to promote\r\n      the general interest of the country, or to render corn cheap, without,\r\n      perhaps, its being well understood how this was to be done. By the other,\r\n      it meant to promote that of a particular order of men, the shopkeepers,\r\n      who would be so much undersold by the manufacturer, it was supposed, that\r\n      their trade would be ruined, if he was allowed to retail at all.\r\n\r\n      The manufacturer, however, though he had been allowed to keep a shop, and\r\n      to sell his own goods by retail, could not have undersold the common\r\n      shopkeeper. Whatever part of his capital he might have placed in his shop,\r\n      he must have withdrawn it from his manufacture. In order to carry on his\r\n      business on a level with that of other people, as he must have had the\r\n      profit of a manufacturer on the one part, so he must have had that of a\r\n      shopkeeper upon the other. Let us suppose, for example, that in the\r\n      particular town where he lived, ten per cent. was the ordinary profit both\r\n      of manufacturing and shopkeeping stock; he must in this case have charged\r\n      upon every piece of his own goods, which he sold in his shop, a profit of\r\n      twenty per cent. When he carried them from his workhouse to his shop, he\r\n      must have valued them at the price for which he could have sold them to a\r\n      dealer or shopkeeper, who would have bought them by wholesale. If he\r\n      valued them lower, he lost a part of the profit of his manufacturing\r\n      capital. When, again, he sold them from his shop, unless he got the same\r\n      price at which a shopkeeper would have sold them, he lost a part of the\r\n      profit of his shop-keeping capital. Though he might appear, therefore, to\r\n      make a double profit upon the same piece of goods, yet, as these goods\r\n      made successively a part of two distinct capitals, he made but a single\r\n      profit upon the whole capital employed about them; and if he made less\r\n      than his profit, he was a loser, and did not employ his whole capital with\r\n      the same advantage as the greater part of his neighbours.\r\n\r\n      What the manufacturer was prohibited to do, the farmer was in some measure\r\n      enjoined to do; to divide his capital between two different employments;\r\n      to keep one part of it in his granaries and stack-yard, for supplying the\r\n      occasional demands of the market, and to employ the other in the\r\n      cultivation of his land. But as he could not afford to employ the latter\r\n      for less than the ordinary profits of farming stock, so he could as little\r\n      afford to employ the former for less than the ordinary profits of\r\n      mercantile stock. Whether the stock which really carried on the business\r\n      of a corn merchant belonged to the person who was called a farmer, or to\r\n      the person who was called a corn merchant, an equal profit was in both\r\n      cases requisite, in order to indemnify its owner for employing it in this\r\n      manner, in order to put his business on a level with other trades, and in\r\n      order to hinder him from having an interest to change it as soon as\r\n      possible for some other. The farmer, therefore, who was thus forced to\r\n      exercise the trade of a corn merchant, could not afford to sell his corn\r\n      cheaper than any other corn merchant would have been obliged to do in the\r\n      case of a free competition.\r\n\r\n      The dealer who can employ his whole stock in one single branch of\r\n      business, has an advantage of the same kind with the workman who can\r\n      employ his whole labour in one single operation. As the latter acquires a\r\n      dexterity which enables him, with the same two hands, to perform a much\r\n      greater quantity of work, so the former acquires so easy and ready a\r\n      method of transacting his business, of buying and disposing of his goods,\r\n      that with the same capital he can transact a much greater quantity of\r\n      business. As the one can commonly afford his work a good deal cheaper, so\r\n      the other can commonly afford his goods somewhat cheaper, than if his\r\n      stock and attention were both employed about a greater variety of objects.\r\n      The greater part of manufacturers could not afford to retail their own\r\n      goods so cheap as a vigilant and active shopkeeper, whose sole business it\r\n      was to buy them by wholesale and to retail them again. The greater part of\r\n      farmers could still less afford to retail their own corn, to supply the\r\n      inhabitants of a town, at perhaps four or five miles distance from the\r\n      greater part of them, so cheap as a vigilant and active corn merchant,\r\n      whose sole business it was to purchase corn by wholesale, to collect it\r\n      into a great magazine, and to retail it again.\r\n\r\n      The law which prohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a\r\n      shopkeeper, endeavoured to force this division in the employment of stock\r\n      to go on faster than it might otherwise have done. The law which obliged\r\n      the farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant, endeavoured to hinder\r\n      it from going on so fast. Both laws were evident violations of natural\r\n      liberty, and therefore unjust; and they were both, too, as impolitic as\r\n      they were unjust. It is the interest of every society, that things of this\r\n      kind should never either he forced or obstructed. The man who employs\r\n      either his labour or his stock in a greater variety of ways than his\r\n      situation renders necessary, can never hurt his neighbour by underselling\r\n      him. He may hurt himself, and he generally does so. Jack-of-all-trades\r\n      will never be rich, says the proverb. But the law ought always to trust\r\n      people with the care of their own interest, as in their local situations\r\n      they must generally be able to judge better of it than the legislature can\r\n      do. The law, however, which obliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a\r\n      corn merchant was by far the most pernicious of the two.\r\n\r\n      It obstructed not only that division in the employment of stock which is\r\n      so advantageous to every society, but it obstructed likewise the\r\n      improvement and cultivation of the land. By obliging the farmer to carry\r\n      on two trades instead of one, it forced him to divide his capital into two\r\n      parts, of which one only could be employed in cultivation. But if he had\r\n      been at liberty to sell his whole crop to a corn merchant as fast as he\r\n      could thresh it out, his whole capital might have returned immediately to\r\n      the land, and have been employed in buying more cattle, and hiring more\r\n      servants, in order to improve and cultivate it better. But by being\r\n      obliged to sell his corn by retail, he was obliged to keep a great part of\r\n      his capital in his granaries and stack-yard through the year, and could\r\n      not therefore cultivate so well as with the same capital he might\r\n      otherwise have done. This law, therefore, necessarily obstructed the\r\n      improvement of the land, and, instead of tending to render corn cheaper,\r\n      must have tended to render it scarcer, and therefore dearer, than it would\r\n      otherwise have been.\r\n\r\n      After the business of the farmer, that of the corn merchant is in reality\r\n      the trade which, if properly protected and encouraged, would contribute\r\n      the most to the raising of corn. It would support the trade of the farmer,\r\n      in the same manner as the trade of the wholesale dealer supports that of\r\n      the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n      The wholesale dealer, by affording a ready market to the manufacturer, by\r\n      taking his goods off his hand as fast as he can make them, and by\r\n      sometimes even advancing their price to him before he has made them,\r\n      enables him to keep his whole capital, and sometimes even more than his\r\n      whole capital, constantly employed in manufacturing, and consequently to\r\n      manufacture a much greater quantity of goods than if he was obliged to\r\n      dispose of them himself to the immediate consumers, or even to the\r\n      retailers. As the capital of the wholesale merchant, too, is generally\r\n      sufficient to replace that of many manufacturers, this intercourse between\r\n      him and them interests the owner of a large capital to support the owners\r\n      of a great number of small ones, and to assist them in those losses and\r\n      misfortunes which might otherwise prove ruinous to them.\r\n\r\n      An intercourse of the same kind universally established between the\r\n      farmers and the corn merchants, would be attended with effects equally\r\n      beneficial to the farmers. They would be enabled to keep their whole\r\n      capitals, and even more than their whole capitals constantly employed in\r\n      cultivation. In case of any of those accidents to which no trade is more\r\n      liable than theirs, they would find in their ordinary customer, the\r\n      wealthy corn merchant, a person who had both an interest to support them,\r\n      and the ability to do it; and they would not, as at present, be entirely\r\n      dependent upon the forbearance of their landlord, or the mercy of his\r\n      steward. Were it possible, as perhaps it is not, to establish this\r\n      intercourse universally, and all at once; were it possible to turn all at\r\n      once the whole farming stock of the kingdom to its proper business, the\r\n      cultivation of land, withdrawing it from every other employment into which\r\n      any part of it may be at present diverted; and were it possible, in order\r\n      to support and assist, upon occasion, the operations of this great stock,\r\n      to provide all at once another stock almost equally great; it is not,\r\n      perhaps, very easy to imagine how great, how extensive, and how sudden,\r\n      would be the improvement which this change of circumstances would alone\r\n      produce upon the whole face of the country.\r\n\r\n      The statute of Edward VI. therefore, by prohibiting as much as possible\r\n      any middle man from coming in between the grower and the consumer,\r\n      endeavoured to annihilate a trade, of which the free exercise is not only\r\n      the best palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth, but the best\r\n      preventive of that calamity; after the trade of the farmer, no trade\r\n      contributing so much to the growing of corn as that of the corn merchant.\r\n\r\n      The rigour of this law was afterwards softened by several subsequent\r\n      statutes, which successively permitted the engrossing of corn when the\r\n      price of wheat should not exceed 20s. and 24s. 32s. and 40s. the quarter.\r\n      At last, by the 15th of Charles II. c.7, the engrossing or buying of corn,\r\n      in order to sell it again, as long as the price of wheat did not exceed\r\n      48s. the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion, was declared\r\n      lawful to all persons not being forestallers, that is, not selling again\r\n      in the same market within three months. All the freedom which the trade of\r\n      the inland corn dealer has ever yet enjoyed was bestowed upon it by this\r\n      statute. The statute of the twelfth of the present king, which repeals\r\n      almost all the other ancient laws against engrossers and forestallers,\r\n      does not repeal the restrictions of this particular statute, which\r\n      therefore still continue in force.\r\n\r\n      This statute, however, authorises in some measure two very absurd popular\r\n      prejudices.\r\n\r\n      First, It supposes, that when the price of wheat has risen so high as 48s.\r\n      the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion, corn is likely to be\r\n      so engrossed as to hurt the people. But, from what has been already said,\r\n      it seems evident enough, that corn can at no price be so engrossed by the\r\n      inland dealers as to hurt the people; and 48s. the quarter, besides,\r\n      though it may be considered as a very high price, yet, in years of\r\n      scarcity, it is a price which frequently takes place immediately after\r\n      harvest, when scarce any part of the new crop can be sold off, and when it\r\n      is impossible even for ignorance to suppose that any part of it can be so\r\n      engrossed as to hurt the people.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, It supposes that there is a certain price at which corn is\r\n      likely to be forestalled, that is, bought up in order to be sold again\r\n      soon after in the same market, so as to hurt the people. But if a merchant\r\n      ever buys up corn, either going to a particular market, or in a particular\r\n      market, in order to sell it again soon after in the same market, it must\r\n      be because he judges that the market cannot be so liberally supplied\r\n      through the whole season as upon that particular occasion, and that the\r\n      price, therefore, must soon rise. If he judges wrong in this, and if the\r\n      price does not rise, he not only loses the whole profit of the stock which\r\n      he employs in this manner, but a part of the stock itself, by the expense\r\n      and loss which necessarily attend the storing and keeping of corn. He\r\n      hurts himself, therefore, much more essentially than he can hurt even the\r\n      particular people whom he may hinder from supplying themselves upon that\r\n      particular market day, because they may afterwards supply themselves just\r\n      as cheap upon any other market day. If he judges right, instead of hurting\r\n      the great body of the people, he renders them a most important service. By\r\n      making them feel the inconveniencies of a dearth somewhat earlier than\r\n      they otherwise might do, he prevents their feeling them afterwards so\r\n      severely as they certainly would do, if the cheapness of price encouraged\r\n      them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season. When\r\n      the scarcity is real, the best thing that can be done for the people is,\r\n      to divide the inconvenience of it as equally as possible, through all the\r\n      different months and weeks and days of the year. The interest of the corn\r\n      merchant makes him study to do this as exactly as he can; and as no other\r\n      person can have either the same interest, or the same knowledge, or the\r\n      same abilities, to do it so exactly as he, this most important operation\r\n      of commerce ought to be trusted entirely to him; or, in other words, the\r\n      corn trade, so far at least as concerns the supply of the home market,\r\n      ought to be left perfectly free.\r\n\r\n      The popular fear of engrossing and forestalling may be compared to the\r\n      popular terrors and suspicions of witchcraft. The unfortunate wretches\r\n      accused of this latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes\r\n      imputed to them, than those who have been accused of the former. The law\r\n      which put an end to all prosecutions against witchcraft, which put it out\r\n      of any man’s power to gratify his own malice by accusing his neighbour of\r\n      that imaginary crime, seems effectually to have put an end to those fears\r\n      and suspicions, by taking away the great cause which encouraged and\r\n      supported them. The law which would restore entire freedom to the inland\r\n      trade of corn, would probably prove as effectual to put an end to the\r\n      popular fears of engrossing and forestalling.\r\n\r\n      The 15th of Charles II. c. 7, however, with all its imperfections, has,\r\n      perhaps, contributed more, both to the plentiful supply of the home\r\n      market, and to the increase of tillage, than any other law in the statute\r\n      book. It is from this law that the inland corn trade has derived all the\r\n      liberty and protection which it has ever yet enjoyed; and both the supply\r\n      of the home market and the interest of tillage are much more effectually\r\n      promoted by the inland, than either by the importation or exportation\r\n      trade.\r\n\r\n      The proportion of the average quantity of all sorts of grain imported into\r\n      Great Britain to that of all sorts of grain consumed, it has been computed\r\n      by the author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, does not exceed that of\r\n      one to five hundred and seventy. For supplying the home market, therefore,\r\n      the importance of the inland trade must be to that of the importation\r\n      trade as five hundred and seventy to one.\r\n\r\n      The average quantity of all sorts of grain exported from Great Britain\r\n      does not, according to the same author, exceed the one-and-thirtieth part\r\n      of the annual produce. For the encouragement of tillage, therefore, by\r\n      providing a market for the home produce, the importance of the inland\r\n      trade must be to that of the exportation trade as thirty to one.\r\n\r\n      I have no great faith in political arithmetic, and I mean not to warrant\r\n      the exactness of either of these computations. I mention them only in\r\n      order to show of how much less consequence, in the opinion of the most\r\n      judicious and experienced persons, the foreign trade of corn is than the\r\n      home trade. The great cheapness of corn in the years immediately preceding\r\n      the establishment of the bounty may, perhaps with reason, he ascribed in\r\n      some measure to the operation of this statute of Charles II. which had\r\n      been enacted about five-and-twenty years before, and which had, therefore,\r\n      full time to produce its effect.\r\n\r\n      A very few words will sufficiently explain all that I have to say\r\n      concerning the other three branches of the corn trade.\r\n\r\n      II. The trade of the merchant-importer of foreign corn for home\r\n      consumption, evidently contributes to the immediate supply of the home\r\n      market, and must so far be immediately beneficial to the great body of the\r\n      people. It tends, indeed, to lower somewhat the average money price of\r\n      corn, but not to diminish its real value, or the quantity of labour which\r\n      it is capable of maintaining. If importation was at all times free, our\r\n      farmers and country gentlemen would probably, one year with another, get\r\n      less money for their corn than they do at present, when importation is at\r\n      most times in effect prohibited; but the money which they got would be of\r\n      more value, would buy more goods of all other kinds, and would employ more\r\n      labour. Their real wealth, their real revenue, therefore, would be the\r\n      same as at present, though it might be expressed by a smaller quantity of\r\n      silver, and they would neither be disabled nor discouraged from\r\n      cultivating corn as much as they do at present. On the contrary, as the\r\n      rise in the real value of silver, in consequence of lowering the money\r\n      price of corn, lowers somewhat the money price of all other commodities,\r\n      it gives the industry of the country where it takes place some advantage\r\n      in all foreign markets and thereby tends to encourage and increase that\r\n      industry. But the extent of the home market for corn must be in proportion\r\n      to the general industry of the country where it grows, or to the number of\r\n      those who produce something else, and therefore, have something else, or,\r\n      what comes to the same thing, the price of something else, to give in\r\n      exchange for corn. But in every country, the home market, as it is the\r\n      nearest and most convenient, so is it likewise the greatest and most\r\n      important market for corn. That rise in the real value of silver,\r\n      therefore, which is the effect of lowering the average money price of\r\n      corn, tends to enlarge the greatest and most important market for corn,\r\n      and thereby to encourage, instead of discouraging its growth.\r\n\r\n      By the 22d of Charles II. c. 13, the importation of wheat, whenever the\r\n      price in the home market did not exceed 53s:4d. the quarter, was subjected\r\n      to a duty of 16s. the quarter; and to a duty of 8s. whenever the price did\r\n      not exceed £4. The former of these two prices has, for more than a century\r\n      past, taken place only in times of very great scarcity; and the latter\r\n      has, so far as I know, not taken place at all. Yet, till wheat has risen\r\n      above this latter price, it was, by this statute, subjected to a very high\r\n      duty; and, till it had risen above the former, to a duty which amounted to\r\n      a prohibition. The importation of other sorts of grain was restrained at\r\n      rates and by duties, in proportion to the value of the grain, almost\r\n      equally high. Before the 13th of the present king, the following were the\r\n      duties payable upon the importation of the different sorts of grain:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Grain.                     Duties.          Duties       Duties.\r\n Beans to 28s. per qr.  19s:10d. after till 40s. 16s:8d. then 12d.\r\n Barley to 28s.   -     19s:10d.         -  32s. 16s.     -   12d.\r\n Malt is prohibited by the annual malt-tax bill.\r\n Oats   to 16s.   -      5s:10d. after   -                    9½d.\r\n Pease   to 40s.  -     16s: 0d. after   -                    9¾d.\r\n Rye     to 36s.  -     19s:10d. till 40s.       16s:8d   -   12d.\r\n Wheat to 44s.    -     21s: 9d. till 53s:4d.    17s.     -    8s.\r\n                          till £4, and after that about       1s:4d.\r\n Buck-wheat to 32s. per qr.     to pay 16s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      These different duties were imposed, partly by the 22d of Charles II. in\r\n      place of the old subsidy, partly by the new subsidy, by the one-third and\r\n      two-thirds subsidy, and by the subsidy 1747. Subsequent laws still further\r\n      increased those duties.\r\n\r\n      The distress which, in years of scarcity, the strict execution of those\r\n      laws might have brought upon the people, would probably have been very\r\n      great; but, upon such occasions, its execution was generally suspended by\r\n      temporary statutes, which permitted, for a limited time, the importation\r\n      of foreign corn. The necessity of these temporary statutes sufficiently\r\n      demonstrates the impropriety of this general one.\r\n\r\n      These restraints upon importation, though prior to the establishment of\r\n      the bounty, were dictated by the same spirit, by the same principles,\r\n      which afterwards enacted that regulation. How hurtful soever in\r\n      themselves, these, or some other restraints upon importation, became\r\n      necessary in consequence of that regulation. If, when wheat was either\r\n      below 48s. the quarter, or not much above it, foreign corn could have been\r\n      imported, either duty free, or upon paying only a small duty, it might\r\n      have been exported again, with the benefit of the bounty, to the great\r\n      loss of the public revenue, and to the entire perversion of the\r\n      institution, of which the object was to extend the market for the home\r\n      growth, not that for the growth of foreign countries.\r\n\r\n      III. The trade of the merchant-exporter of corn for foreign consumption,\r\n      certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful supply of the home\r\n      market. It does so, however, indirectly. From whatever source this supply\r\n      maybe usually drawn, whether from home growth, or from foreign\r\n      importation, unless more corn is either usually grown, or usually imported\r\n      into the country, than what is usually consumed in it, the supply of the\r\n      home market can never be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can, in\r\n      all ordinary cases, be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow\r\n      more, and the importers never to import more, than what the bare\r\n      consumption of the home market requires. That market will very seldom be\r\n      overstocked; but it will generally be understocked; the people, whose\r\n      business it is to supply it, being generally afraid lest their goods\r\n      should be left upon their hands. The prohibition of exportation limits the\r\n      improvement and cultivation of the country to what the supply of its own\r\n      inhabitants require. The freedom of exportation enables it to extend\r\n      cultivation for the supply of foreign nations.\r\n\r\n      By the 12th of Charles II. c.4, the exportation of corn was permitted\r\n      whenever the price of wheat did not exceed 40s. the quarter, and that of\r\n      other grain in proportion. By the 15th of the same prince, this liberty\r\n      was extended till the price of wheat exceeded 48s. the quarter; and by the\r\n      22d, to all higher prices. A poundage, indeed, was to be paid to the king\r\n      upon such exportation; but all grain was rated so low in the book of\r\n      rates, that this poundage amounted only, upon wheat to 1s., upon oats to\r\n      4d., and upon all other grain to 6d. the quarter. By the 1st of William\r\n      and Mary, the act which established this bounty, this small duty was\r\n      virtually taken off whenever the price of wheat did not exceed 48s. the\r\n      quarter; and by the 11th and 12th of William III. c. 20, it was expressly\r\n      taken off at all higher prices.\r\n\r\n      The trade of the merchant-exporter was, in this manner, not only\r\n      encouraged by a bounty, but rendered much more free than that of the\r\n      inland dealer. By the last of these statutes, corn could be engrossed at\r\n      any price for exportation; but it could not be engrossed for inland sale,\r\n      except when the price did not exceed 48s. the quarter. The interest of the\r\n      inland dealer, however, it has already been shown, can never be opposite\r\n      to that of the great body of the people. That of the merchant-exporter\r\n      may, and in fact sometimes is. If, while his own country labours under a\r\n      dearth, a neighbouring country should be afflicted with a famine, it might\r\n      be his interest to carry corn to the latter country, in such quantities as\r\n      might very much aggravate the calamities of the dearth. The plentiful\r\n      supply of the home market was not the direct object of those statutes;\r\n      but, under the pretence of encouraging agriculture, to raise the money\r\n      price of corn as high as possible, and thereby to occasion, as much as\r\n      possible, a constant dearth in the home market. By the discouragement of\r\n      importation, the supply of that market; even in times of great scarcity,\r\n      was confined to the home growth; and by the encouragement of exportation,\r\n      when the price was so high as 48s. the quarter, that market was not, even\r\n      in times of considerable scarcity, allowed to enjoy the whole of that\r\n      growth. The temporary laws, prohibiting, for a limited time, the\r\n      exportation of corn, and taking off, for a limited time, the duties upon\r\n      its importation, expedients to which Great Britain has been obliged so\r\n      frequently to have recourse, sufficiently demonstrate the impropriety of\r\n      her general system. Had that system been good, she would not so frequently\r\n      have been reduced to the necessity of departing from it.\r\n\r\n      Were all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation and free\r\n      importation, the different states into which a great continent was\r\n      divided, would so far resemble the different provinces of a great empire.\r\n      As among the different provinces of a great empire, the freedom of the\r\n      inland trade appears, both from reason and experience, not only the best\r\n      palliative of a dearth, but the most effectual preventive of a famine; so\r\n      would the freedom of the exportation and importation trade be among the\r\n      different states into which a great continent was divided. The larger the\r\n      continent, the easier the communication through all the different parts of\r\n      it, both by land and by water, the less would any one particular part of\r\n      it ever be exposed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any one\r\n      country being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some other. But\r\n      very few countries have entirely adopted this liberal system. The freedom\r\n      of the corn trade is almost everywhere more or less restrained, and in\r\n      many countries is confined by such absurd regulations, as frequently\r\n      aggravate the unavoidable misfortune of a dearth into the dreadful\r\n      calamity of a famine. The demand of such countries for corn may frequently\r\n      become so great and so urgent, that a small state in their neighbourhood,\r\n      which happened at the same time to be labouring under some degree of\r\n      dearth, could not venture to supply them without exposing itself to the\r\n      like dreadful calamity. The very bad policy of one country may thus render\r\n      it, in some measure, dangerous and imprudent to establish what would\r\n      otherwise be the best policy in another. The unlimited freedom of\r\n      exportation, however, would be much less dangerous in great states, in\r\n      which the growth being much greater, the supply could seldom be much\r\n      affected by any quantity or corn that was likely to be exported. In a\r\n      Swiss canton, or in some of the little states in Italy, it may, perhaps,\r\n      sometimes be necessary to restrain the exportation of corn. In such great\r\n      countries as France or England, it scarce ever can. To hinder, besides,\r\n      the farmer from sending his goods at all times to the best market, is\r\n      evidently to sacrifice the ordinary laws of justice to an idea of public\r\n      utility, to a sort of reasons of state; an act or legislative authority\r\n      which ought to be exercised only, which can be pardoned only, in cases of\r\n      the most urgent necessity. The price at which exportation of corn is\r\n      prohibited, if it is ever to be prohibited, ought always to be a very high\r\n      price.\r\n\r\n      The laws concerning corn may everywhere be compared to the laws concerning\r\n      religion. The people feel themselves so much interested in what relates\r\n      either to their subsistence in this life, or to their happiness in a life\r\n      to come, that government must yield to their prejudices, and, in order to\r\n      preserve the public tranquillity, establish that system which they approve\r\n      of. It is upon this account, perhaps, that we so seldom find a reasonable\r\n      system established with regard to either of those two capital objects.\r\n\r\n      IV. The trade of the merchant-carrier, or of the importer of foreign corn,\r\n      in order to export it again, contributes to the plentiful supply of the\r\n      home market. It is not, indeed, the direct purpose of his trade to sell\r\n      his corn there; but he will generally be willing to do so, and even for a\r\n      good deal less money than he might expect in a foreign market; because he\r\n      saves in this manner the expense of loading and unloading, of freight and\r\n      insurance. The inhabitants of the country which, by means of the carrying\r\n      trade, becomes the magazine and storehouse for the supply of other\r\n      countries, can very seldom be in want themselves. Though the carrying\r\n      trade must thus contribute to reduce the average money price of corn in\r\n      the home market, it would not thereby lower its real value; it would only\r\n      raise somewhat the real value of silver.\r\n\r\n      The carrying trade was in effect prohibited in Great Britain, upon all\r\n      ordinary occasions, by the high duties upon the importation of foreign\r\n      corn, of the greater part of which there was no drawback; and upon\r\n      extraordinary occasions, when a scarcity made it necessary to suspend\r\n      those duties by temporary statutes, exportation was always prohibited. By\r\n      this system of laws, therefore, the carrying trade was in effect\r\n      prohibited.\r\n\r\n      That system of laws, therefore, which is connected with the establishment\r\n      of the bounty, seems to deserve no part of the praise which has been\r\n      bestowed upon it. The improvement and prosperity of Great Britain, which\r\n      has been so often ascribed to those laws, may very easily be accounted for\r\n      by other causes. That security which the laws in Great Britain give to\r\n      every man, that he shall enjoy the fruits of his own labour, is alone\r\n      sufficient to make any country flourish, notwithstanding these and twenty\r\n      other absurd regulations of commerce; and this security was perfected by\r\n      the Revolution, much about the same time that the bounty was established.\r\n      The natural effort of every individual to better his own condition, when\r\n      suffered to exert itself with freedom and security, is so powerful a\r\n      principle, that it is alone, and without any assistance, not only capable\r\n      of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a\r\n      hundred impertinent obstructions, with which the folly of human laws too\r\n      often encumbers its operations: though the effect of those obstructions is\r\n      always, more or less, either to encroach upon its freedom, or to diminish\r\n      its security. In Great Britain industry is perfectly secure; and though it\r\n      is far from being perfectly free, it is as free or freer than in any other\r\n      part of Europe.\r\n\r\n      Though the period of the greatest prosperity and improvement of Great\r\n      Britain has been posterior to that system of laws which is connected with\r\n      the bounty, we must not upon that account, impute it to those laws. It has\r\n      been posterior likewise to the national debt; but the national debt has\r\n      most assuredly not been the cause of it.\r\n\r\n      Though the system of laws which is connected with the bounty, has exactly\r\n      the same tendency with the practice of Spain and Portugal, to lower\r\n      somewhat the value of the precious metals in the country where it takes\r\n      place; yet Great Britain is certainly one of the richest countries in\r\n      Europe, while Spain and Portugal are perhaps amongst the most beggarly.\r\n      This difference of situation, however, may easily be accounted for from\r\n      two different causes. First, the tax in Spain, the prohibition in Portugal\r\n      of exporting gold and silver, and the vigilant police which watches over\r\n      the execution of those laws, must, in two very poor countries, which\r\n      between them import annually upwards of six millions sterling, operate not\r\n      only more directly, but much more forcibly, in reducing the value of those\r\n      metals there, than the corn laws can do in Great Britain. And, secondly,\r\n      this bad policy is not in those countries counterbalanced by the general\r\n      liberty and security of the people. Industry is there neither free nor\r\n      secure; and the civil and ecclesiastical governments of both Spain and\r\n      Portugal are such as would alone be sufficient to perpetuate their present\r\n      state of poverty, even though their regulations of commerce were as wise\r\n      as the greatest part of them are absurd and foolish.\r\n\r\n      The 13th of the present king, c. 43, seems to have established a new\r\n      system with regard to the corn laws, in many respects better than the\r\n      ancient one, but in one or two respects perhaps not quite so good.\r\n\r\n      By this statute, the high duties upon importation for home consumption are\r\n      taken off, so soon as the price of middling wheat rises to 48s. the\r\n      quarter; that of middling rye, pease, or beans, to 32s.; that of barley to\r\n      24s.; and that of oats to 16s.; and instead of them, a small duty is\r\n      imposed of only 6d upon the quarter of wheat, and upon that or other grain\r\n      in proportion. With regard to all those different sorts of grain, but\r\n      particularly with regard to wheat, the home market is thus opened to\r\n      foreign supplies, at prices considerably lower than before.\r\n\r\n      By the same statute, the old bounty of 5s. upon the exportation of wheat,\r\n      ceases so soon as the price rises to 44s. the quarter, instead of 48s. the\r\n      price at which it ceased before; that of 2s:6d. upon the exportation of\r\n      barley, ceases so soon as the price rises to 22s. instead of 24s. the\r\n      price at which it ceased before; that of 2s:6d. upon the exportation of\r\n      oatmeal, ceases so soon as the price rises to 14s. instead of 15s. the\r\n      price at which it ceased before. The bounty upon rye is reduced from\r\n      3s:6d. to 3s. and it ceases so soon as the price rises to 28s. instead of\r\n      32s. the price at which it ceased before. If bounties are as improper as I\r\n      have endeavoured to prove them to be, the sooner they cease, and the lower\r\n      they are, so much the better.\r\n\r\n      The same statute permits, at the lowest prices, the importation of corn in\r\n      order to be exported again, duty free, provided it is in the mean time\r\n      lodged in a warehouse under the joint locks of the king and the importer.\r\n      This liberty, indeed, extends to no more than twenty-five of the different\r\n      ports of Great Britain. They are, however, the principal ones; and there\r\n      may not, perhaps, be warehouses proper for this purpose in the greater\r\n      part of the others.\r\n\r\n      So far this law seems evidently an improvement upon the ancient system.\r\n\r\n      But by the same law, a bounty of 2s. the quarter is given for the\r\n      exportation of oats, whenever the price does not exceed fourteen\r\n      shillings. No bounty had ever been given before for the exportation of\r\n      this grain, no more than for that of pease or beans.\r\n\r\n      By the same law, too, the exportation of wheat is prohibited so soon as\r\n      the price rises to forty-four shillings the quarter; that of rye so soon\r\n      as it rises to twenty-eight shillings; that of barley so soon as it rises\r\n      to twenty-two shillings; and that of oats so soon as they rise to fourteen\r\n      shillings. Those several prices seem all of them a good deal too low; and\r\n      there seems to be an impropriety, besides, in prohibiting exportation\r\n      altogether at those precise prices at which that bounty, which was given\r\n      in order to force it, is withdrawn. The bounty ought certainly either to\r\n      have been withdrawn at a much lower price, or exportation ought to have\r\n      been allowed at a much higher.\r\n\r\n      So far, therefore, this law seems to be inferior to the ancient system.\r\n      With all its imperfections, however, we may perhaps say of it what was\r\n      said of the laws of Solon, that though not the best in itself, it is the\r\n      best which the interest, prejudices, and temper of the times, would admit\r\n      of. It may perhaps in due time prepare the way for a better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nOF TREATIES OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      When a nation binds itself by treaty, either to permit the entry of\r\n      certain goods from one foreign country which it prohibits from all others,\r\n      or to exempt the goods of one country from duties to which it subjects\r\n      those of all others, the country, or at least the merchants and\r\n      manufacturers of the country, whose commerce is so favoured, must\r\n      necessarily derive great advantage from the treaty. Those merchants and\r\n      manufacturers enjoy a sort of monopoly in the country which is so\r\n      indulgent to them. That country becomes a market, both more extensive and\r\n      more advantageous for their goods: more extensive, because the goods of\r\n      other nations being either excluded or subjected to heavier duties, it\r\n      takes off a greater quantity of theirs; more advantageous, because the\r\n      merchants of the favoured country, enjoying a sort of monopoly there, will\r\n      often sell their goods for a better price than if exposed to the free\r\n      competition of all other nations.\r\n\r\n      Such treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the merchants\r\n      and manufacturers of the favoured, are necessarily disadvantageous to\r\n      those of the favouring country. A monopoly is thus granted against them to\r\n      a foreign nation; and they must frequently buy the foreign goods they have\r\n      occasion for, dearer than if the free competition of other nations was\r\n      admitted. That part of its own produce with which such a nation purchases\r\n      foreign goods, must consequently be sold cheaper; because, when two things\r\n      are exchanged for one another, the cheapness of the one is a necessary\r\n      consequence, or rather is the same thing, with the dearness of the other.\r\n      The exchangeable value of its annual produce, therefore, is likely to be\r\n      diminished by every such treaty. This diminution, however, can scarce\r\n      amount to any positive loss, but only to a lessening of the gain which it\r\n      might otherwise make. Though it sells its goods cheaper than it otherwise\r\n      might do, it will not probably sell them for less than they cost; nor, as\r\n      in the case of bounties, for a price which will not replace the capital\r\n      employed in bringing them to market, together with the ordinary profits of\r\n      stock. The trade could not go on long if it did. Even the favouring\r\n      country, therefore, may still gain by the trade, though less than if there\r\n      was a free competition.\r\n\r\n      Some treaties of commerce, however, have been supposed advantageous, upon\r\n      principles very different from these; and a commercial country has\r\n      sometimes granted a monopoly of this kind, against itself, to certain\r\n      goods of a foreign nation, because it expected, that in the whole commerce\r\n      between them, it would annually sell more than it would buy, and that a\r\n      balance in gold and silver would be annually returned to it. It is upon\r\n      this principle that the treaty of commerce between England and Portugal,\r\n      concluded in 1703 by Mr Methuen, has been so much commended. The following\r\n      is a literal translation of that treaty, which consists of three articles\r\n      only.\r\n\r\n      ART. I. His sacred royal majesty of Portugal promises, both in his own\r\n      name and that of his successors, to admit for ever hereafter, into\r\n      Portugal, the woollen cloths, and the rest of the woollen manufactures of\r\n      the British, as was accustomed, till they were prohibited by the law;\r\n      nevertheless upon this condition:\r\n\r\n      ART. II. That is to say, that her sacred royal majesty of Great Britain\r\n      shall, in her own name, and that of her successors, be obliged, for ever\r\n      hereafter, to admit the wines of the growth of Portugal into Britain; so\r\n      that at no time, whether there shall be peace or war between the kingdoms\r\n      of Britain and France, any thing more shall be demanded for these wines by\r\n      the name of custom or duty, or by whatsoever other title, directly or\r\n      indirectly, whether they shall be imported into Great Britain in pipes or\r\n      hogsheads, or other casks, than what shall be demanded for the like\r\n      quantity or measure of French wine, deducting or abating a third part of\r\n      the custom or duty. But if, at any time, this deduction or abatement of\r\n      customs, which is to be made as aforesaid, shall in any manner be\r\n      attempted and prejudiced, it shall be just and lawful for his sacred royal\r\n      majesty of Portugal, again to prohibit the woollen cloths, and the rest of\r\n      the British woollen manufactures.\r\n\r\n      ART. III. The most excellent lords the plenipotentiaries promise and take\r\n      upon themselves, that their above named masters shall ratify this treaty;\r\n      and within the space of two months the ratification shall be exchanged.\r\n\r\n      By this treaty, the crown of Portugal becomes bound to admit the English\r\n      woollens upon the same footing as before the prohibition; that is, not to\r\n      raise the duties which had been paid before that time. But it does not\r\n      become bound to admit them upon any better terms than those of any other\r\n      nation, of France or Holland, for example. The crown of Great Britain, on\r\n      the contrary, becomes bound to admit the wines of Portugal, upon paying\r\n      only two-thirds of the duty which is paid for those of France, the wines\r\n      most likely to come into competition with them. So far this treaty,\r\n      therefore, is evidently advantageous to Portugal, and disadvantageous to\r\n      Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      It has been celebrated, however, as a masterpiece of the commercial policy\r\n      of England. Portugal receives annually from the Brazils a greater quantity\r\n      of gold than can be employed in its domestic commerce, whether in the\r\n      shape of coin or of plate. The surplus is too valuable to be allowed to\r\n      lie idle and locked up in coffers; and as it can find no advantageous\r\n      market at home, it must, notwithstanding; any prohibition, be sent abroad,\r\n      and exchanged for something for which there is a more advantageous market\r\n      at home. A large share of it comes annually to England, in return either\r\n      for English goods, or for those of other European nations that receive\r\n      their returns through England. Mr Barretti was informed, that the weekly\r\n      packet-boat from Lisbon brings, one week with another, more than £50,000\r\n      in gold to England. The sum had probably been exaggerated. It would amount\r\n      to more than £2,600,000 a year, which is more than the Brazils are\r\n      supposed to afford.\r\n\r\n      Our merchants were, some years ago, out of humour with the crown of\r\n      Portugal. Some privileges which had been granted them, not by treaty, but\r\n      by the free grace of that crown, at the solicitation, indeed, it is\r\n      probable, and in return for much greater favours, defence and protection\r\n      from the crown of Great Britain, had been either infringed or revoked. The\r\n      people, therefore, usually most interested in celebrating the Portugal\r\n      trade, were then rather disposed to represent it as less advantageous than\r\n      it had commonly been imagined. The far greater part, almost the whole,\r\n      they pretended, of this annual importation of gold, was not on account of\r\n      Great Britain, but of other European nations; the fruits and wines of\r\n      Portugal annually imported into Great Britain nearly compensating the\r\n      value of the British goods sent thither.\r\n\r\n      Let us suppose, however, that the whole was on account of Great Britain,\r\n      and that it amounted to a still greater sum than Mr Barretti seems to\r\n      imagine; this trade would not, upon that account, be more advantageous\r\n      than any other, in which, for the same value sent out, we received an\r\n      equal value of consumable goods in return.\r\n\r\n      It is but a very small part of this importation which, it can be supposed,\r\n      is employed as an annual addition, either to the plate or to the coin of\r\n      the kingdom. The rest must all be sent abroad, and exchanged for\r\n      consumable goods of some kind or other. But if those consumable goods were\r\n      purchased directly with the produce of English industry, it would be more\r\n      for the advantage of England, than first to purchase with that produce the\r\n      gold of Portugal, and afterwards to purchase with that gold those\r\n      consumable goods. A direct foreign trade of consumption is always more\r\n      advantageous than a round-about one; and to bring the same value of\r\n      foreign goods to the home market requires a much smaller capital in the\r\n      one way than in the ether. If a smaller share of its industry, therefore,\r\n      had been employed in producing goods fit for the Portugal market, and a\r\n      greater in producing those lit for the other markets, where those\r\n      consumable goods for which there is a demand in Great Britain are to be\r\n      had, it would have been more for the advantage of England. To procure both\r\n      the gold which it wants for its own use, and the consumable goods, would,\r\n      in this way, employ a much smaller capital than at present. There would be\r\n      a spare capital, therefore, to be employed for other purposes, in exciting\r\n      an additional quantity of industry, and in raising a greater annual\r\n      produce.\r\n\r\n      Though Britain were entirely excluded from the Portugal trade, it could\r\n      find very little difficulty in procuring all the annual supplies of gold\r\n      which it wants, either for the purposes of plate, or of coin, or of\r\n      foreign trade. Gold, like every other commodity, is always somewhere or\r\n      another to be got for its value by those who have that value to give for\r\n      it. The annual surplus of gold in Portugal, besides, would still be sent\r\n      abroad, and though not carried away by Great Britain, would be carried\r\n      away by some other nation, which would be glad to sell it again for its\r\n      price, in the same manner as Great Britain does at present. In buying gold\r\n      of Portugal, indeed, we buy it at the first hand; whereas, in buying it of\r\n      any other nation, except Spain, we should buy it at the second, and might\r\n      pay somewhat dearer. This difference, however, would surely be too\r\n      insignificant to deserve the public attention.\r\n\r\n      Almost all our gold, it is said, comes from Portugal. With other nations,\r\n      the balance of trade is either against as, or not much in our favour. But\r\n      we should remember, that the more gold we import from one country, the\r\n      less we must necessarily import from all others. The effectual demand for\r\n      gold, like that for every other commodity, is in every country limited to\r\n      a certain quantity. If nine-tenths of this quantity are imported from one\r\n      country, there remains a tenth only to be imported from all others. The\r\n      more gold, besides, that is annually imported from some particular\r\n      countries, over and above what is requisite for plate and for coin, the\r\n      more must necessarily be exported to some others: and the more that most\r\n      insignificant object of modern policy, the balance of trade, appears to be\r\n      in our favour with some particular countries, the more it must necessarily\r\n      appear to be against us with many others.\r\n\r\n      It was upon this silly notion, however, that England could not subsist\r\n      without the Portugal trade, that, towards the end of the late war, France\r\n      and Spain, without pretending either offence or provocation, required the\r\n      king of Portugal to exclude all British ships from his ports, and, for the\r\n      security of this exclusion, to receive into them French or Spanish\r\n      garrisons. Had the king of Portugal submitted to those ignominious terms\r\n      which his brother-in-law the king of Spain proposed to him, Britain would\r\n      have been freed from a much greater inconveniency than the loss of the\r\n      Portugal trade, the burden of supporting a very weak ally, so unprovided\r\n      of every thing for his own defence, that the whole power of England, had\r\n      it been directed to that single purpose, could scarce, perhaps, have\r\n      defended him for another campaign. The loss of the Portugal trade would,\r\n      no doubt, have occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at\r\n      that time engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a\r\n      year or two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their\r\n      capitals; and in this would probably have consisted all the inconveniency\r\n      which England could have suffered from this notable piece of commercial\r\n      policy.\r\n\r\n      The great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the purpose\r\n      of plate nor of coin, but of foreign trade. A round-about foreign trade of\r\n      consumption can be carried on more advantageously by means of these metals\r\n      than of almost any other goods. As they are the universal instruments of\r\n      commerce, they are more readily received in return for all commodities\r\n      than any other goods; and, on account of their small bulk and great value,\r\n      it costs less to transport them backward and forward from one place to\r\n      another than almost any other sort of merchandize, and they lose less of\r\n      their value by being so transported. Of all the commodities, therefore,\r\n      which are bought in one foreign country, for no other purpose but to be\r\n      sold or exchanged again for some other goods in another, there are none so\r\n      convenient as gold and silver. In facilitating all the different\r\n      round-about foreign trades of consumption which are carried on in Great\r\n      Britain, consists the principal advantage of the Portugal trade; and\r\n      though it is not a capital advantage, it is, no doubt, a considerable one.\r\n\r\n      That any annual addition which, it can reasonably be supposed, is made\r\n      either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom, could require but a\r\n      very small annual importation of gold and silver, seems evident enough;\r\n      and though we had no direct trade with Portugal, this small quantity could\r\n      always, somewhere or another, be very easily got.\r\n\r\n      Though the goldsmiths trade be very considerable in Great Britain, the far\r\n      greater part of the new plate which they annually sell, is made from other\r\n      old plate melted down; so that the addition annually made to the whole\r\n      plate of the kingdom cannot be very great, and could require but a very\r\n      small annual importation.\r\n\r\n      It is the same case with the coin. Nobody imagines, I believe, that even\r\n      the greater part of the annual coinage, amounting, for ten years together,\r\n      before the late reformation of the gold coin, to upwards of £800,000\r\n      a-year in gold, was an annual addition to the money before current in the\r\n      kingdom. In a country where the expense of the coinage is defrayed by the\r\n      government, the value of the coin, even when it contains its full standard\r\n      weight of gold and silver, can never be much greater than that of an equal\r\n      quantity of those metals uncoined, because it requires only the trouble of\r\n      going to the mint, and the delay, perhaps, of a few weeks, to procure for\r\n      any quantity of uncoined gold and silver an equal quantity of those metals\r\n      in coin; but in every country the greater part of the current coin is\r\n      almost always more or less worn, or otherwise degenerated from its\r\n      standard. In Great Britain it was, before the late reformation, a good\r\n      deal so, the gold being more than two per cent., and the silver more than\r\n      eight per cent. below its standard weight. But if forty-four guineas and\r\n      a-half, containing their full standard weight, a pound weight of gold,\r\n      could purchase very little more than a pound weight of uncoined gold;\r\n      forty-four guineas and a-half, wanting a part of their weight, could not\r\n      purchase a pound weight, and something was to be added, in order to make\r\n      up the deficiency. The current price of gold bullion at market, therefore,\r\n      instead of being the same with the mint price, or £46:14:6, was then about\r\n      £47:14s., and sometimes about £48. When the greater part of the coin,\r\n      however, was in this degenerate condition, forty four guineas and a-half,\r\n      fresh from the mint, would purchase no more goods in the market than any\r\n      other ordinary guineas; because, when they came into the coffers of the\r\n      merchant, being confounded with other money, they could not afterwards be\r\n      distinguished without more trouble than the difference was worth. Like\r\n      other guineas, they were worth no more than £46:14:6. If thrown into the\r\n      melting pot, however, they produced, without any sensible loss, a pound\r\n      weight of standard gold, which could be sold at any time for between\r\n      £47:14s. and £48, either in gold or silver, as fit for all the purposes of\r\n      coin as that which had been melted down. There was an evident profit,\r\n      therefore, in melting down new-coined money; and it was done so\r\n      instantaneously, that no precaution of government could prevent it. The\r\n      operations of the mint were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of\r\n      Penelope; the work that was done in the day was undone in the night. The\r\n      mint was employed, not so much in making daily additions to the coin, as\r\n      in replacing the very best part of it, which was daily melted down.\r\n\r\n      Were the private people who carry their gold and silver to the mint to pay\r\n      themselves for the coinage, it would add to the value of those metals, in\r\n      the same manner as the fashion does to that of plate. Coined gold and\r\n      silver would be more valuable than uncoined. The seignorage, if it was not\r\n      exorbitant, would add to the bullion the whole value of the duty; because,\r\n      the government having everywhere the exclusive privilege of coining, no\r\n      coin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to afford it. If\r\n      the duty was exorbitant, indeed, that is, if it was very much above the\r\n      real value of the labour and expense requisite for coinage, false coiners,\r\n      both at home and abroad, might be encouraged, by the great difference\r\n      between the value of bullion and that of coin, to pour in so great a\r\n      quantity of counterfeit money as might reduce the value of the government\r\n      money. In France, however, though the seignorage is eight per cent., no\r\n      sensible inconveniency of this kind is found to arise from it. The dangers\r\n      to which a false coiner is everywhere exposed, if he lives in the country\r\n      of which he counterfeits the coin, and to which his agents or\r\n      correspondents are exposed, if he lives in a foreign country, are by far\r\n      too great to be incurred for the sake of a profit of six or seven per\r\n      cent.\r\n\r\n      The seignorage in France raises the value of the coin higher than in\r\n      proportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains. Thus, by the\r\n      edict of January 1726, the mint price of fine gold of twenty-four carats\r\n      was fixed at seven hundred and forty livres nine sous and one denier\r\n      one-eleventh the mark of eight Paris ounces. {See Dictionnaire des\r\n      Monnoies, tom. ii. article Seigneurage, p. 439, par 81. Abbot de\r\n      Bazinghen, Conseiller-Commissaire en la Cour des Monnoies à Paris.} The\r\n      gold coin of France, making an allowance for the remedy of the mint,\r\n      contains twenty-one carats and three-fourths of fine gold, and two carats\r\n      one-fourth of alloy. The mark of standard gold, therefore, is worth no\r\n      more than about six hundred and seventy-one livres ten deniers. But in\r\n      France this mark of standard gold is coined into thirty louis d’ors of\r\n      twenty-four livres each, or into seven hundred and twenty livres. The\r\n      coinage, therefore, increases the value of a mark of standard gold\r\n      bullion, by the difference between six hundred and seventy-one livres ten\r\n      deniers and seven hundred and twenty livres, or by forty-eight livres\r\n      nineteen sous and two deniers.\r\n\r\n      A seignorage will, in many cases, take away altogether, and will in all\r\n      cases diminish, the profit of melting down the new coin. This profit\r\n      always arises from the difference between the quantity of bullion which\r\n      the common currency ought to contain and that which it actually does\r\n      contain. If this difference is less than the seignorage, there will be\r\n      loss instead of profit. If it is equal to the seignorage, there will be\r\n      neither profit nor loss. If it is greater than the seignorage, there will,\r\n      indeed, be some profit, but less than if there was no seignorage. If,\r\n      before the late reformation of the gold coin, for example, there had been\r\n      a seignorage of five per cent. upon the coinage, there would have been a\r\n      loss of three per cent. upon the melting down of the gold coin. If the\r\n      seignorage had been two per cent., there would have been neither profit\r\n      nor loss. If the seignorage had been one per cent., there would have been\r\n      a profit but of one per cent. only, instead of two per cent. Wherever\r\n      money is received by tale, therefore, and not by weight, a seignorage is\r\n      the most effectual preventive of the melting down of the coin, and, for\r\n      the same reason, of its exportation. It is the best and heaviest pieces\r\n      that are commonly either melted down or exported, because it is upon such\r\n      that the largest profits are made.\r\n\r\n      The law for the encouragement of the coinage, by rendering it duty-free,\r\n      was first enacted during the reign of Charles II. for a limited time, and\r\n      afterwards continued, by different prolongations, till 1769, when it was\r\n      rendered perpetual. The bank of England, in order to replenish their\r\n      coffers with money, are frequently obliged to carry bullion to the mint;\r\n      and it was more for their interest, they probably imagined, that the\r\n      coinage should be at the expense of the government than at their own. It\r\n      was probably out of complaisance to this great company, that the\r\n      government agreed to render this law perpetual. Should the custom of\r\n      weighing gold, however, come to be disused, as it is very likely to be on\r\n      account of its inconveniency; should the gold coin of England come to be\r\n      received by tale, as it was before the late recoinage this great company\r\n      may, perhaps, find that they have, upon this, as upon some other\r\n      occasions, mistaken their own interest not a little.\r\n\r\n      Before the late recoinage, when the gold currency of England was two per\r\n      cent. below its standard weight, as there was no seignorage, it was two\r\n      per cent. below the value of that quantity of standard gold bullion which\r\n      it ought to have contained. When this great company, therefore, bought\r\n      gold bullion in order to have it coined, they were obliged to pay for it\r\n      two per cent. more than it was worth after the coinage. But if there had\r\n      been a seignorage of two per cent. upon the coinage, the common gold\r\n      currency, though two per cent. below its standard weight, would,\r\n      notwithstanding, have been equal in value to the quantity of standard gold\r\n      which it ought to have contained; the value of the fashion compensating in\r\n      this case the diminution of the weight. They would, indeed, have had the\r\n      seignorage to pay, which being two per cent., their loss upon the whole\r\n      transaction would have been two per cent., exactly the same, but no\r\n      greater than it actually was.\r\n\r\n      If the seignorage had been five per cent. and the gold currency only two\r\n      per cent. below its standard weight, the bank would, in this case, have\r\n      gained three per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they would\r\n      have had a seignorage of five per cent. to pay upon the coinage, their\r\n      loss upon the whole transaction would, in the same manner, have been\r\n      exactly two per cent.\r\n\r\n      If the seignorage had been only one per cent., and the gold currency two\r\n      per cent. below its standard weight, the bank would, in this case, have\r\n      lost only one per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they would\r\n      likewise have had a seignorage of one per cent. to pay, their loss upon\r\n      the whole transaction would have been exactly two per cent., in the same\r\n      manner as in all other cases.\r\n\r\n      If there was a reasonable seignorage, while at the same time the coin\r\n      contained its full standard weight, as it has done very nearly since the\r\n      late recoinage, whatever the bank might lose by the seignorage, they would\r\n      gain upon the price of the bullion; and whatever they might gain upon the\r\n      price of the bullion, they would lose by the seignorage. They would\r\n      neither lose nor gain, therefore, upon the whole transaction, and they\r\n      would in this, as in all the foregoing cases, be exactly in the same\r\n      situation as if there was no seignorage.\r\n\r\n      When the tax upon a commodity is so moderate as not to encourage\r\n      smuggling, the merchant who deals in it, though he advances, does not\r\n      properly pay the tax, as he gets it back in the price of the commodity.\r\n      The tax is finally paid by the last purchaser or consumer. But money is a\r\n      commodity, with regard to which every man is a merchant. Nobody buys it\r\n      but in order to sell it again; and with regard to it there is, in ordinary\r\n      cases, no last purchaser or consumer. When the tax upon coinage,\r\n      therefore, is so moderate as not to encourage false coining, though every\r\n      body advances the tax, nobody finally pays it; because every body gets it\r\n      back in the advanced value of the coin.\r\n\r\n      A moderate seignorage, therefore, would not, in any case, augment the\r\n      expense of the bank, or of any other private persons who carry their\r\n      bullion to the mint in order to be coined; and the want of a moderate\r\n      seignorage does not in any case diminish it. Whether there is or is not a\r\n      seignorage, if the currency contains its full standard weight, the coinage\r\n      costs nothing to anybody; and if it is short of that weight, the coinage\r\n      must always cost the difference between the quantity of bullion which\r\n      ought to be contained in it, and that which actually is contained in it.\r\n\r\n      The government, therefore, when it defrays the expense of coinage, not\r\n      only incurs some small expense, but loses some small revenue which it\r\n      might get by a proper duty; and neither the bank, nor any other private\r\n      persons, are in the smallest degree benefited by this useless piece of\r\n      public generosity.\r\n\r\n      The directors of the bank, however, would probably be unwilling to agree\r\n      to the imposition of a seignorage upon the authority of a speculation\r\n      which promises them no gain, but only pretends to insure them from any\r\n      loss. In the present state of the gold coin, and as long as it continues\r\n      to be received by weight, they certainly would gain nothing by such a\r\n      change. But if the custom of weighing the gold coin should ever go into\r\n      disuse, as it is very likely to do, and if the gold coin should ever fall\r\n      into the same state of degradation in which it was before the late\r\n      recoinage, the gain, or more properly the savings, of the bank,\r\n      in consequence of the imposition of a seignorage, would probably be very\r\n      considerable. The bank of England is the only company which sends any\r\n      considerable quantity of bullion to the mint, and the burden of the annual\r\n      coinage falls entirely, or almost entirely, upon it. If this annual\r\n      coinage had nothing to do but to repair the unavoidable losses and\r\n      necessary wear and tear of the coin, it could seldom exceed fifty\r\n      thousand, or at most a hundred thousand pounds. But when the coin is\r\n      degraded below its standard weight, the annual coinage must, besides this,\r\n      fill up the large vacuities which exportation and the melting pot are\r\n      continually making in the current coin. It was upon this account, that\r\n      during the ten or twelve years immediately preceding the late reformation\r\n      of the gold coin, the annual coinage amounted, at an average, to more than\r\n      £850,000. But if there had been a seignorage of four or five per cent.\r\n      upon the gold coin, it would probably, even in the state in which things\r\n      then were, have put an effectual stop to the business both of exportation\r\n      and of the melting pot. The bank, instead of losing every year about two\r\n      and a half per cent. upon the bullion which was to be coined into more\r\n      than eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds, or incurring an annual loss\r\n      of more than £21,250 pounds, would not probably have incurred the tenth\r\n      part of that loss.\r\n\r\n      The revenue allotted by parliament for defraying the expense of the\r\n      coinage is but fourteen thousand pounds a-year; and the real expense which\r\n      it costs the government, or the fees of the officers of the mint, do not,\r\n      upon ordinary occasions, I am assured, exceed the half of that sum. The\r\n      saving of so very small a sum, or even the gaining of another, which could\r\n      not well be much larger, are objects too inconsiderable, it may be\r\n      thought, to deserve the serious attention of government. But the saving of\r\n      eighteen or twenty thousand pounds a-year, in case of an event which is\r\n      not improbable, which has frequently happened before, and which is very\r\n      likely to happen again, is surely an object which well deserves the\r\n      serious attention, even of so great a company as the bank of England.\r\n\r\n      Some of the foregoing reasonings and observations might, perhaps, have\r\n      been more properly placed in those chapters of the first book which treat\r\n      of the origin and use of money, and of the difference between the real and\r\n      the nominal price of commodities. But as the law for the encouragement of\r\n      coinage derives its origin from those vulgar prejudices which have been\r\n      introduced by the mercantile system, I judged it more proper to reserve\r\n      them for this chapter. Nothing could be more agreeable to the spirit of\r\n      that system than a sort of bounty upon the production of money, the very\r\n      thing which, it supposes, constitutes the wealth of every nation. It is\r\n      one of its many admirable expedients for enriching the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nOF COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART I. Of the Motives for Establishing New Colonies.\r\n\r\n      The interest which occasioned the first settlement of the different\r\n      European colonies in America and the West Indies, was not altogether so\r\n      plain and distinct as that which directed the establishment of those of\r\n      ancient Greece and Rome.\r\n\r\n      All the different states of ancient Greece possessed, each of them, but a\r\n      very small territory; and when the people in anyone of them multiplied\r\n      beyond what that territory could easily maintain, a part of them were sent\r\n      in quest of a new habitation, in some remote and distant part of the\r\n      world; the warlike neighbours who surrounded them on all sides, rendering\r\n      it difficult for any of them to enlarge very much its territory at home.\r\n      The colonies of the Dorians resorted chiefly to Italy and Sicily, which,\r\n      in the times preceding the foundation of Rome, were inhabited by barbarous\r\n      and uncivilized nations; those of the Ionians and Aeolians, the two other\r\n      great tribes of the Greeks, to Asia Minor and the islands of the Aegean\r\n      sea, of which the inhabitants sewn at that time to have been pretty much\r\n      in the same state as those of Sicily and Italy. The mother city, though\r\n      she considered the colony as a child, at all times entitled to great\r\n      favour and assistance, and owing in return much gratitude and respect, yet\r\n      considered it as an emancipated child, over whom she pretended to claim no\r\n      direct authority or jurisdiction. The colony settled its own form of\r\n      government, enacted its own laws, elected its own magistrates, and made\r\n      peace or war with its neighbours, as an independent state, which had no\r\n      occasion to wait for the approbation or consent of the mother city.\r\n      Nothing can be more plain and distinct than the interest which directed\r\n      every such establishment.\r\n\r\n      Rome, like most of the other ancient republics, was originally founded\r\n      upon an agrarian law, which divided the public territory, in a certain\r\n      proportion, among the different citizens who composed the state. The\r\n      course of human affairs, by marriage, by succession, and by alienation,\r\n      necessarily deranged this original division, and frequently threw the\r\n      lands which had been allotted for the maintenance of many different\r\n      families, into the possession of a single person. To remedy this disorder,\r\n      for such it was supposed to be, a law was made, restricting the quantity\r\n      of land which any citizen could possess to five hundred jugera; about 350\r\n      English acres. This law, however, though we read of its having been\r\n      executed upon one or two occasions, was either neglected or evaded, and\r\n      the inequality of fortunes went on continually increasing. The greater\r\n      part of the citizens had no land; and without it the manners and customs\r\n      of those times rendered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his\r\n      independency. In the present times, though a poor man has no land of his\r\n      own, if he has a little stock, he may either farm the lands of another, or\r\n      he may carry on some little retail trade; and if he has no stock, he may\r\n      find employment either as a country labourer, or as an artificer. But\r\n      among the ancient Romans, the lands of the rich were all cultivated by\r\n      slaves, who wrought under an overseer, who was likewise a slave; so that a\r\n      poor freeman had little chance of being employed either as a farmer or as\r\n      a labourer. All trades and manufactures, too, even the retail trade, were\r\n      carried on by the slaves of the rich for the benefit of their masters,\r\n      whose wealth, authority, and protection, made it difficult for a poor\r\n      freeman to maintain the competition against them. The citizens, therefore,\r\n      who had no land, had scarce any other means of subsistence but the\r\n      bounties of the candidates at the annual elections. The tribunes, when\r\n      they had a mind to animate the people against the rich and the great, put\r\n      them in mind of the ancient divisions of lands, and represented that law\r\n      which restricted this sort of private property as the fundamental law of\r\n      the republic. The people became clamorous to get land, and the rich and\r\n      the great, we may believe, were perfectly determined not to give them any\r\n      part of theirs. To satisfy them in some measure, therefore, they\r\n      frequently proposed to send out a new colony. But conquering Rome was,\r\n      even upon such occasions, under no necessity of turning out her citizens\r\n      to seek their fortune, if one may so, through the wide world, without\r\n      knowing where they were to settle. She assigned them lands generally in\r\n      the conquered provinces of Italy, where, being within the dominions of the\r\n      republic, they could never form any independent state, but were at best\r\n      but a sort of corporation, which, though it had the power of enacting\r\n      bye-laws for its own government, was at all times subject to the\r\n      correction, jurisdiction, and legislative authority of the mother city.\r\n      The sending out a colony of this kind not only gave some satisfaction to\r\n      the people, but often established a sort of garrison, too, in a newly\r\n      conquered province, of which the obedience might otherwise have been\r\n      doubtful. A Roman colony, therefore, whether we consider the nature of the\r\n      establishment itself, or the motives for making it, was altogether\r\n      different from a Greek one. The words, accordingly, which in the original\r\n      languages denote those different establishments, have very different\r\n      meanings. The Latin word (colonia) signifies simply a plantation. The\r\n      Greek word (apoixia), on the contrary, signifies a separation of dwelling,\r\n      a departure from home, a going out of the house. But though the Roman\r\n      colonies were, in many respects, different from the Greek ones, the\r\n      interest which prompted to establish them was equally plain and distinct.\r\n      Both institutions derived their origin, either from irresistible\r\n      necessity, or from clear and evident utility.\r\n\r\n      The establishment of the European colonies in America and the West Indies\r\n      arose from no necessity; and though the utility which has resulted from\r\n      them has been very great, it is not altogether so clear and evident. It\r\n      was not understood at their first establishment, and was not the motive,\r\n      either of that establishment, or of the discoveries which gave occasion to\r\n      it; and the nature, extent, and limits of that utility, are not, perhaps,\r\n      well understood at this day.\r\n\r\n      The Venetians, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, carried on a\r\n      very advantageous commerce in spiceries and other East India goods, which\r\n      they distributed among the other nations of Europe. They purchased them\r\n      chiefly in Egypt, at that time under the dominion of the Mamelukes, the\r\n      enemies of the Turks, of whom the Venetians were the enemies; and this\r\n      union of interest, assisted by the money of Venice, formed such a\r\n      connexion as gave the Venetians almost a monopoly of the trade.\r\n\r\n      The great profits of the Venetians tempted the avidity of the Portuguese.\r\n      They had been endeavouring, during the course of the fifteenth century, to\r\n      find out by sea a way to the countries from which the Moors brought them\r\n      ivory and gold dust across the desert. They discovered the Madeiras, the\r\n      Canaries, the Azores, the Cape de Verd islands, the coast of Guinea, that\r\n      of Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela, and, finally, the Cape of Good\r\n      Hope. They had long wished to share in the profitable traffic of the\r\n      Venetians, and this last discovery opened to them a probable prospect of\r\n      doing so. In 1497, Vasco de Gamo sailed from the port of Lisbon with a\r\n      fleet of four ships, and, after a navigation of eleven months, arrived\r\n      upon the coast of Indostan; and thus completed a course of discoveries\r\n      which had been pursued with great steadiness, and with very little\r\n      interruption, for near a century together.\r\n\r\n      Some years before this, while the expectations of Europe were in suspense\r\n      about the projects of the Portuguese, of which the success appeared yet to\r\n      be doubtful, a Genoese pilot formed the yet more daring project of sailing\r\n      to the East Indies by the west. The situation of those countries was at\r\n      that time very imperfectly known in Europe. The few European travellers\r\n      who had been there, had magnified the distance, perhaps through simplicity\r\n      and ignorance; what was really very great, appearing almost infinite to\r\n      those who could not measure it; or, perhaps, in order to increase somewhat\r\n      more the marvellous of their own adventures in visiting regions so\r\n      immensely remote from Europe. The longer the way was by the east, Columbus\r\n      very justly concluded, the shorter it would be by the west. He proposed,\r\n      therefore, to take that way, as both the shortest and the surest, and he\r\n      had the good fortune to convince Isabella of Castile of the probability of\r\n      his project. He sailed from the port of Palos in August 1492, near five\r\n      years before the expedition of Vasco de Gamo set out from Portugal; and,\r\n      after a voyage of between two and three months, discovered first some of\r\n      the small Bahama or Lucyan islands, and afterwards the great island of St.\r\n      Domingo.\r\n\r\n      But the countries which Columbus discovered, either in this or in any of\r\n      his subsequent voyages, had no resemblance to those which he had gone in\r\n      quest of. Instead of the wealth, cultivation, and populousness of China\r\n      and Indostan, he found, in St. Domingo, and in all the other parts of the\r\n      new world which he ever visited, nothing but a country quite covered with\r\n      wood, uncultivated, and inhabited only by some tribes of naked and\r\n      miserable savages. He was not very willing, however, to believe that they\r\n      were not the same with some of the countries described by Marco Polo, the\r\n      first European who had visited, or at least had left behind him any\r\n      description of China or the East Indies; and a very slight resemblance,\r\n      such as that which he found between the name of Cibao, a mountain in St.\r\n      Domingo, and that of Cipange, mentioned by Marco Polo, was frequently\r\n      sufficient to make him return to this favourite prepossession, though\r\n      contrary to the clearest evidence. In his letters to Ferdinand and\r\n      Isabella, he called the countries which he had discovered the Indies. He\r\n      entertained no doubt but that they were the extremity of those which had\r\n      been described by Marco Polo, and that they were not very distant from the\r\n      Ganges, or from the countries which had been conquered by Alexander. Even\r\n      when at last convinced that they were different, he still flattered\r\n      himself that those rich countries were at no great distance; and in a\r\n      subsequent voyage, accordingly, went in quest of them along the coast of\r\n      Terra Firma, and towards the Isthmus of Darien.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of this mistake of Columbus, the name of the Indies has\r\n      stuck to those unfortunate countries ever since; and when it was at last\r\n      clearly discovered that the new were altogether different from the old\r\n      Indies, the former were called the West, in contradistinction to the\r\n      latter, which were called the East Indies.\r\n\r\n      It was of importance to Columbus, however, that the countries which he had\r\n      discovered, whatever they were, should be represented to the court of\r\n      Spain as of very great consequence; and, in what constitutes the real\r\n      riches of every country, the animal and vegetable productions of the soil,\r\n      there was at that time nothing which could well justify such a\r\n      representation of them.\r\n\r\n      The cori, something between a rat and a rabbit, and supposed by Mr Buffon\r\n      to be the same with the aperea of Brazil, was the largest viviparous\r\n      quadruped in St. Domingo. This species seems never to have been very\r\n      numerous; and the dogs and cats of the Spaniards are said to have long ago\r\n      almost entirely extirpated it, as well as some other tribes of a still\r\n      smaller size. These, however, together with a pretty large lizard, called\r\n      the ivana or iguana, constituted the principal part of the animal food\r\n      which the land afforded.\r\n\r\n      The vegetable food of the inhabitants, though, from their want of\r\n      industry, not very abundant, was not altogether so scanty. It consisted in\r\n      Indian corn, yams, potatoes, bananas, etc., plants which were then\r\n      altogether unknown in Europe, and which have never since been very much\r\n      esteemed in it, or supposed to yield a sustenance equal to what is drawn\r\n      from the common sorts of grain and pulse, which have been cultivated in\r\n      this part of the world time out of mind.\r\n\r\n      The cotton plant, indeed, afforded the material of a very important\r\n      manufacture, and was at that time, to Europeans, undoubtedly the most\r\n      valuable of all the vegetable productions of those islands. But though, in\r\n      the end of the fifteenth century, the muslins and other cotton goods of\r\n      the East Indies were much esteemed in every part of Europe, the cotton\r\n      manufacture itself was not cultivated in any part of it. Even this\r\n      production, therefore, could not at that time appear in the eyes of\r\n      Europeans to be of very great consequence.\r\n\r\n      Finding nothing, either in the animals or vegetables of the newly\r\n      discovered countries which could justify a very advantageous\r\n      representation of them, Columbus turned his view towards their minerals;\r\n      and in the richness of their productions of this third kingdom, he\r\n      flattered himself he had found a full compensation for the insignificancy\r\n      of those of the other two. The little bits of gold with which the\r\n      inhabitants ornamented their dress, and which, he was informed, they\r\n      frequently found in the rivulets and torrents which fell from the\r\n      mountains, were sufficient to satisfy him that those mountains abounded\r\n      with the richest gold mines. St. Domingo, therefore, was represented as a\r\n      country abounding with gold, and upon that account (according to the\r\n      prejudices not only of the present times, but of those times), an\r\n      inexhaustible source of real wealth to the crown and kingdom of Spain.\r\n      When Columbus, upon his return from his first voyage, was introduced with\r\n      a sort of triumphal honours to the sovereigns of Castile and Arragon, the\r\n      principal productions of the countries which he had discovered were\r\n      carried in solemn procession before him. The only valuable part of them\r\n      consisted in some little fillets, bracelets, and other ornaments of gold,\r\n      and in some bales of cotton. The rest were mere objects of vulgar wonder\r\n      and curiosity; some reeds of an extraordinary size, some birds of a very\r\n      beautiful plumage, and some stuffed skins of the huge alligator and\r\n      manati; all of which were preceded by six or seven of the wretched\r\n      natives, whose singular colour and appearance added greatly to the novelty\r\n      of the show.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of the representations of Columbus, the council of Castile\r\n      determined to take possession of the countries of which the inhabitants\r\n      were plainly incapable of defending themselves. The pious purpose of\r\n      converting them to Christianity sanctified the injustice of the project.\r\n      But the hope of finding treasures of gold there was the sole motive which\r\n      prompted to undertake it; and to give this motive the greater weight, it\r\n      was proposed by Columbus, that the half of all the gold and silver that\r\n      should be found there, should belong to the crown. This proposal was\r\n      approved of by the council.\r\n\r\n      As long as the whole, or the greater part of the gold which the first\r\n      adventurers imported into Europe was got by so very easy a method as the\r\n      plundering of the defenceless natives, it was not perhaps very difficult\r\n      to pay even this heavy tax; but when the natives were once fairly stript\r\n      of all that they had, which, in St. Domingo, and in all the other\r\n      countries discovered by Columbus, was done completely in six or eight\r\n      years, and when, in order to find more, it had become necessary to dig for\r\n      it in the mines, there was no longer any possibility of paying this tax.\r\n      The rigorous exaction of it, accordingly, first occasioned, it is said,\r\n      the total abandoning of the mines of St. Domingo, which have never been\r\n      wrought since. It was soon reduced, therefore, to a third; then to a\r\n      fifth; afterwards to a tenth; and at last to a twentieth part of the gross\r\n      produce of the gold mines. The tax upon silver continued for a long time\r\n      to be a fifth of the gross produce. It was reduced to a tenth only in the\r\n      course of the present century. But the first adventurers do not appear to\r\n      have been much interested about silver. Nothing less precious than gold\r\n      seemed worthy of their attention.\r\n\r\n      All the other enterprizes of the Spaniards in the New World, subsequent to\r\n      those of Columbus, seem to have been prompted by the same motive. It was\r\n      the sacred thirst of gold that carried Ovieda, Nicuessa, and Vasco Nugnes\r\n      de Balboa, to the Isthmus of Darien; that carried Cortes to Mexico,\r\n      Almagro and Pizarro to Chili and Peru. When those adventurers arrived upon\r\n      any unknown coast, their first inquiry was always if there was any gold to\r\n      be found there; and according to the information which they received\r\n      concerning this particular, they determined either to quit the country or\r\n      to settle in it.\r\n\r\n      Of all those expensive and uncertain projects, however, which bring\r\n      bankruptcy upon the greater part of the people who engage in them, there\r\n      is none, perhaps, more perfectly ruinous than the search after new silver\r\n      and gold mines. It is, perhaps, the most disadvantageous lottery in the\r\n      world, or the one in which the gain of those who draw the prizes bears the\r\n      least proportion to the loss of those who draw the blanks; for though the\r\n      prizes are few, and the blanks many, the common price of a ticket is the\r\n      whole fortune of a very rich man. Projects of mining, instead of replacing\r\n      the capital employed in them, together with the ordinary profits of stock,\r\n      commonly absorb both capital and profit. They are the projects, therefore,\r\n      to which, of all others, a prudent lawgiver, who desired to increase the\r\n      capital of his nation, would least choose to give any extraordinary\r\n      encouragement, or to turn towards them a greater share of that capital\r\n      than what would go to them of its own accord. Such, in reality, is the\r\n      absurd confidence which almost all men have in their own good fortune,\r\n      that wherever there is the least probability of success, too great a share\r\n      of it is apt to go to them of its own accord.\r\n\r\n      But though the judgment of sober reason and experience concerning such\r\n      projects has always been extremely unfavourable, that of human avidity has\r\n      commonly been quite otherwise. The same passion which has suggested to so\r\n      many people the absurd idea of the philosopher’s stone, has suggested to\r\n      others the equally absurd one of immense rich mines of gold and silver.\r\n      They did not consider that the value of those metals has, in all ages and\r\n      nations, arisen chiefly from their scarcity, and that their scarcity has\r\n      arisen from the very small quantities of them which nature has anywhere\r\n      deposited in one place, from the hard and intractable substances with\r\n      which she has almost everywhere surrounded those small quantities, and\r\n      consequently from the labour and expense which are everywhere necessary in\r\n      order to penetrate, and get at them. They flattered themselves that veins\r\n      of those metals might in many places be found, as large and as abundant as\r\n      those which are commonly found of lead, or copper, or tin, or iron. The\r\n      dream of Sir Waiter Raleigh, concerning the golden city and country of El\r\n      Dorado, may satisfy us, that even wise men are not always exempt from such\r\n      strange delusions. More than a hundred years after the death of that great\r\n      man, the Jesuit Gumila was still convinced of the reality of that\r\n      wonderful country, and expressed, with great warmth, and, I dare say, with\r\n      great sincerity, how happy he should be to carry the light of the gospel\r\n      to a people who could so well reward the pious labours of their\r\n      missionary.\r\n\r\n      In the countries first discovered by the Spaniards, no gold and silver\r\n      mines are at present known which are supposed to be worth the working. The\r\n      quantities of those metals which the first adventurers are said to have\r\n      found there, had probably been very much magnified, as well as the\r\n      fertility of the mines which were wrought immediately after the first\r\n      discovery. What those adventurers were reported to have found, however,\r\n      was sufficient to inflame the avidity of all their countrymen. Every\r\n      Spaniard who sailed to America expected to find an El Dorado. Fortune,\r\n      too, did upon this what she has done upon very few other occasions. She\r\n      realized in some measure the extravagant hopes of her votaries; and in the\r\n      discovery and conquest of Mexico and Peru (of which the one happened about\r\n      thirty, and the other about forty, years after the first expedition of\r\n      Columbus), she presented them with something not very unlike that\r\n      profusion of the precious metals which they sought for.\r\n\r\n      A project of commerce to the East Indies, therefore, gave occasion to the\r\n      first discovery of the West. A project of conquest gave occasion to all\r\n      the establishments of the Spaniards in those newly discovered countries.\r\n      The motive which excited them to this conquest was a project of gold and\r\n      silver mines; and a course of accidents which no human wisdom could\r\n      foresee, rendered this project much more successful than the undertakers\r\n      had any reasonable grounds for expecting.\r\n\r\n      The first adventurers of all the other nations of Europe who attempted to\r\n      make settlements in America, were animated by the like chimerical views;\r\n      but they were not equally successful. It was more than a hundred years\r\n      after the first settlement of the Brazils, before any silver, gold, or\r\n      diamond mines, were discovered there. In the English, French, Dutch, and\r\n      Danish colonies, none have ever yet been discovered, at least none that\r\n      are at present supposed to be worth the working. The first English\r\n      settlers in North America, however, offered a fifth of all the gold and\r\n      silver which should be found there to the king, as a motive for granting\r\n      them their patents. In the patents of Sir Waiter Raleigh, to the London\r\n      and Plymouth companies, to the council of Plymouth, etc. this fifth was\r\n      accordingly reserved to the crown. To the expectation of finding gold and\r\n      silver mines, those first settlers, too, joined that of discovering a\r\n      north-west passage to the East Indies. They have hitherto been\r\n      disappointed in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART II. Causes of the Prosperity of New Colonies.\r\n\r\n      The colony of a civilized nation which takes possession either of a waste\r\n      country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily give place\r\n      to the new settlers, advances more rapidly to wealth and greatness than\r\n      any other human society.\r\n\r\n      The colonies carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and of other\r\n      useful arts, superior to what can grow up of its own accord, in the course\r\n      of many centuries, among savage and barbarous nations. They carry out with\r\n      them, too, the habit of subordination, some notion of the regular\r\n      government which takes place in their own country, of the system of laws\r\n      which support it, and of a regular administration of justice; and they\r\n      naturally establish something of the same kind in the new settlement. But\r\n      among savage and barbarous nations, the natural progress of law and\r\n      government is still slower than the natural progress of arts, after law\r\n      and government have been so far established as is necessary for their\r\n      protection. Every colonist gets more land than he can possibly cultivate.\r\n      He has no rent, and scarce any taxes, to pay. No landlord shares with him\r\n      in its produce, and, the share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle.\r\n      He has every motive to render as great as possible a produce which is thus\r\n      to be almost entirely his own. But his land is commonly so extensive,\r\n      that, with all his own industry, and with all the industry of other people\r\n      whom he can get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of\r\n      what it is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect\r\n      labourers from all quarters, and to reward them with the most liberal\r\n      wages. But those liberal wages, joined to the plenty and cheapness of\r\n      land, soon make those labourers leave him, in order to become landlords\r\n      themselves, and to reward with equal liberality other labourers, who soon\r\n      leave them for the same reason that they left their first master. The\r\n      liberal reward of labour encourages marriage. The children, during the\r\n      tender years of infancy, are well fed and properly taken care of; and when\r\n      they are grown up, the value of their labour greatly overpays their\r\n      maintenance. When arrived at maturity, the high price of labour, and the\r\n      low price of land, enable them to establish themselves in the same manner\r\n      as their fathers did before them.\r\n\r\n      In other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior\r\n      orders of people oppress the inferior one; but in new colonies, the\r\n      interest of the two superior orders obliges them to treat the inferior one\r\n      with more generosity and humanity, at least where that inferior one is not\r\n      in a state of slavery. Waste lands, of the greatest natural fertility, are\r\n      to be had for a trifle. The increase of revenue which the proprietor, who\r\n      is always the undertaker, expects from their improvement, constitutes his\r\n      profit, which, in these circumstances, is commonly very great; but this\r\n      great profit cannot be made, without employing the labour of other people\r\n      in clearing and cultivating the land; and the disproportion between the\r\n      great extent of the land and the small number of the people, which\r\n      commonly takes place in new colonies, makes it difficult for him to get\r\n      this labour. He does not, therefore, dispute about wages, but is willing\r\n      to employ labour at any price. The high wages of labour encourage\r\n      population. The cheapness and plenty of good land encourage improvement,\r\n      and enable the proprietor to pay those high wages. In those wages consists\r\n      almost the whole price of the land; and though they are high, considered\r\n      as the wages of labour, they are low, considered as the price of what is\r\n      so very valuable. What encourages the progress of population and\r\n      improvement, encourages that of real wealth and greatness.\r\n\r\n      The progress of many of the ancient Greek colonies towards wealth and\r\n      greatness seems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the course of a\r\n      century or two, several of them appear to have rivalled, and even to have\r\n      surpassed, their mother cities. Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily,\r\n      Tarentum and Locri in Italy, Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia, appear,\r\n      by all accounts, to have been at least equal to any of the cities of\r\n      ancient Greece. Though posterior in their establishment, yet all the arts\r\n      of refinement, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, seem to have been\r\n      cultivated as early, and to have been improved as highly in them as in any\r\n      part of the mother country. The schools of the two oldest Greek\r\n      philosophers, those of Thales and Pythagoras, were established, it is\r\n      remarkable, not in ancient Greece, but the one in an Asiatic, the other in\r\n      an Italian colony. All those colonies had established themselves in\r\n      countries inhabited by savage and barbarous nations, who easily gave place\r\n      to the new settlers. They had plenty of good land; and as they were\r\n      altogether independent of the mother city, they were at liberty to manage\r\n      their own affairs in the way that they judged was most suitable to their\r\n      own interest.\r\n\r\n      The history of the Roman colonies is by no means so brilliant. Some of\r\n      them, indeed, such as Florence, have, in the course of many ages, and\r\n      after the fall of the mother city, grown up to be considerable states. But\r\n      the progress of no one of them seems ever to have been very rapid. They\r\n      were all established in conquered provinces, which in most cases had been\r\n      fully inhabited before. The quantity of land assigned to each colonist was\r\n      seldom very considerable, and, as the colony was not independent, they\r\n      were not always at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way that\r\n      they judged was most suitable to their own interest.\r\n\r\n      In the plenty of good land, the European colonies established in America\r\n      and the West Indies resemble, and even greatly surpass, those of ancient\r\n      Greece. In their dependency upon the mother state, they resemble those of\r\n      ancient Rome; but their great distance from Europe has in all of them\r\n      alleviated more or less the effects of this dependency. Their situation\r\n      has placed them less in the view, and less in the power of their mother\r\n      country. In pursuing their interest their own way, their conduct has upon\r\n      many occasions been overlooked, either because not known or not understood\r\n      in Europe; and upon some occasions it has been fairly suffered and\r\n      submitted to, because their distance rendered it difficult to restrain it.\r\n      Even the violent and arbitrary government of Spain has, upon many\r\n      occasions, been obliged to recall or soften the orders which had been\r\n      given for the government of her colonies, for fear of a general\r\n      insurrection. The progress of all the European colonies in wealth,\r\n      population, and improvement, has accordingly been very great.\r\n\r\n      The crown of Spain, by its share of the gold and silver, derived some\r\n      revenue from its colonies from the moment of their first establishment. It\r\n      was a revenue, too, of a nature to excite in human avidity the most\r\n      extravagant expectation of still greater riches. The Spanish colonies,\r\n      therefore, from the moment of their first establishment, attracted very\r\n      much the attention of their mother country; while those of the other\r\n      European nations were for a long time in a great measure neglected. The\r\n      former did not, perhaps, thrive the better in consequence of this\r\n      attention, nor the latter the worse in consequence of this neglect. In\r\n      proportion to the extent of the country which they in some measure\r\n      possess, the Spanish colonies are considered as less populous and thriving\r\n      than those of almost any other European nation. The progress even of the\r\n      Spanish colonies, however, in population and improvement, has certainly\r\n      been very rapid and very great. The city of Lima, founded since the\r\n      conquest, is represented by Ulloa as containing fifty thousand inhabitants\r\n      near thirty years ago. Quito, which had been but a miserable hamlet of\r\n      Indians, is represented by the same author as in his time equally\r\n      populous. Gemel i Carreri, a pretended traveller, it is said, indeed, but\r\n      who seems everywhere to have written upon extreme good information,\r\n      represents the city of Mexico as containing a hundred thousand\r\n      inhabitants; a number which, in spite of all the exaggerations of the\r\n      Spanish writers, is probably more than five times greater than what it\r\n      contained in the time of Montezuma. These numbers exceed greatly those of\r\n      Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, the three greatest cities of the\r\n      English colonies. Before the conquest of the Spaniards, there were no\r\n      cattle fit for draught, either in Mexico or Peru. The lama was their only\r\n      beast of burden, and its strength seems to have been a good deal inferior\r\n      to that of a common ass. The plough was unknown among them. They were\r\n      ignorant of the use of iron. They had no coined money, nor any established\r\n      instrument of commerce of any kind. Their commerce was carried on by\r\n      barter. A sort of wooden spade was their principal instrument of\r\n      agriculture. Sharp stones served them for knives and hatchets to cut with;\r\n      fish bones, and the hard sinews of certain animals, served them with\r\n      needles to sew with; and these seem to have been their principal\r\n      instruments of trade. In this state of things, it seems impossible that\r\n      either of those empires could have been so much improved or so well\r\n      cultivated as at present, when they are plentifully furnished with all\r\n      sorts of European cattle, and when the use of iron, of the plough, and of\r\n      many of the arts of Europe, have been introduced among them. But the\r\n      populousness of every country must be in proportion to the degree of its\r\n      improvement and cultivation. In spite of the cruel destruction of the\r\n      natives which followed the conquest, these two great empires are probably\r\n      more populous now than they ever were before; and the people are surely\r\n      very different; for we must acknowledge, I apprehend, that the Spanish\r\n      creoles are in many respects superior to the ancient Indians.\r\n\r\n      After the settlements of the Spaniards, that of the Portuguese in Brazil\r\n      is the oldest of any European nation in America. But as for a long time\r\n      after the first discovery neither gold nor silver mines were found in it,\r\n      and as it afforded upon that account little or no revenue to the crown, it\r\n      was for a long time in a great measure neglected; and during this state of\r\n      neglect, it grew up to be a great and powerful colony. While Portugal was\r\n      under the dominion of Spain, Brazil was attacked by the Dutch, who got\r\n      possession of seven of the fourteen provinces into which it is divided.\r\n      They expected soon to conquer the other seven, when Portugal recovered its\r\n      independency by the elevation of the family of Braganza to the throne. The\r\n      Dutch, then, as enemies to the Spaniards, became friends to the\r\n      Portuguese, who were likewise the enemies of the Spaniards. They agreed,\r\n      therefore, to leave that part of Brazil which they had not conquered to\r\n      the king of Portugal, who agreed to leave that part which they had\r\n      conquered to them, as a matter not worth disputing about, with such good\r\n      allies. But the Dutch government soon began to oppress the Portuguese\r\n      colonists, who, instead of amusing themselves with complaints, took arms\r\n      against their new masters, and by their own valour and resolution, with\r\n      the connivance, indeed, but without any avowed assistance from the mother\r\n      country, drove them out of Brazil. The Dutch, therefore, finding it\r\n      impossible to keep any part of the country to themselves, were contented\r\n      that it should be entirely restored to the crown of Portugal. In this\r\n      colony there are said to be more than six hundred thousand people, either\r\n      Portuguese or descended from Portuguese, creoles, mulattoes, and a mixed\r\n      race between Portuguese and Brazilians. No one colony in America is\r\n      supposed to contain so great a number of people of European extraction.\r\n\r\n      Towards the end of the fifteenth, and during the greater part of the\r\n      sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal were the two great naval powers upon\r\n      the ocean; for though the commerce of Venice extended to every part of\r\n      Europe, its fleet had scarce ever sailed beyond the Mediterranean. The\r\n      Spaniards, in virtue of the first discovery, claimed all America as their\r\n      own; and though they could not hinder so great a naval power as that of\r\n      Portugal from settling in Brazil, such was at that time the terror of\r\n      their name, that the greater part of the other nations of Europe were\r\n      afraid to establish themselves in any other part of that great continent.\r\n      The French, who attempted to settle in Florida, were all murdered by the\r\n      Spaniards. But the declension of the naval power of this latter nation, in\r\n      consequence of the defeat or miscarriage of what they called their\r\n      invincible armada, which happened towards the end of the sixteenth\r\n      century, put it out of their power to obstruct any longer the settlements\r\n      of the other European nations. In the course of the seventeenth century,\r\n      therefore, the English, French, Dutch, Danes, and Swedes, all the great\r\n      nations who had any ports upon the ocean, attempted to make some\r\n      settlements in the new world.\r\n\r\n      The Swedes established themselves in New Jersey; and the number of Swedish\r\n      families still to be found there sufficiently demonstrates, that this\r\n      colony was very likely to prosper, had it been protected by the mother\r\n      country. But being neglected by Sweden, it was soon swallowed up by the\r\n      Dutch colony of New York, which again, in 1674, fell under the dominion of\r\n      the English.\r\n\r\n      The small islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz, are the only countries in\r\n      the new world that have ever been possessed by the Danes. These little\r\n      settlements, too, were under the government of an exclusive company, which\r\n      had the sole right, both of purchasing the surplus produce of the\r\n      colonies, and of supplying them with such goods of other countries as they\r\n      wanted, and which, therefore, both in its purchases and sales, had not\r\n      only the power of oppressing them, but the greatest temptation to do so.\r\n      The government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst\r\n      of all governments for any country whatever. It was not, however, able to\r\n      stop altogether the progress of these colonies, though it rendered it more\r\n      slow and languid. The late king of Denmark dissolved this company, and\r\n      since that time the prosperity of these colonies has been very great.\r\n\r\n      The Dutch settlements in the West, as well as those in the East Indies,\r\n      were originally put under the government of an exclusive company. The\r\n      progress of some of them, therefore, though it has been considerable in\r\n      comparison with that of almost any country that has been long peopled and\r\n      established, has been languid and slow in comparison with that of the\r\n      greater part of new colonies. The colony of Surinam, though very\r\n      considerable, is still inferior to the greater part of the sugar colonies\r\n      of the other European nations. The colony of Nova Belgia, now divided into\r\n      the two provinces of New York and New Jersey, would probably have soon\r\n      become considerable too, even though it had remained under the government\r\n      of the Dutch. The plenty and cheapness of good land are such powerful\r\n      causes of prosperity, that the very worst government is scarce capable of\r\n      checking altogether the efficacy of their operation. The great distance,\r\n      too, from the mother country, would enable the colonists to evade more or\r\n      less, by smuggling, the monopoly which the company enjoyed against them.\r\n      At present, the company allows all Dutch ships to trade to Surinam, upon\r\n      paying two and a-half per cent. upon the value of their cargo for a\r\n      license; and only reserves to itself exclusively, the direct trade from\r\n      Africa to America, which consists almost entirely in the slave trade. This\r\n      relaxation in the exclusive privileges of the company, is probably the\r\n      principal cause of that degree of prosperity which that colony at present\r\n      enjoys. Curacoa and Eustatia, the two principal islands belonging to the\r\n      Dutch, are free ports, open to the ships of all nations; and this freedom,\r\n      in the midst of better colonies, whose ports are open to those of one\r\n      nation only, has been the great cause of the prosperity of those two\r\n      barren islands.\r\n\r\n      The French colony of Canada was, during the greater part of the last\r\n      century, and some part of the present, under the government of an\r\n      exclusive company. Under so unfavourable an administration, its progress\r\n      was necessarily very slow, in comparison with that of other new colonies;\r\n      but it became much more rapid when this company was dissolved, after the\r\n      fall of what is called the Mississippi scheme. When the English got\r\n      possession of this country, they found in it near double the number of\r\n      inhabitants which father Charlevoix had assigned to it between twenty and\r\n      thirty years before. That jesuit had travelled over the whole country, and\r\n      had no inclination to represent it as less inconsiderable than it really\r\n      was.\r\n\r\n      The French colony of St. Domingo was established by pirates and\r\n      freebooters, who, for a long time, neither required the protection, nor\r\n      acknowledged the authority of France; and when that race of banditti\r\n      became so far citizens as to acknowledge this authority, it was for a long\r\n      time necessary to exercise it with very great gentleness. During this\r\n      period, the population and improvement of this colony increased very fast.\r\n      Even the oppression of the exclusive company, to which it was for some\r\n      time subjected with all the other colonies of France, though it no doubt\r\n      retarded, had not been able to stop its progress altogether. The course of\r\n      its prosperity returned as soon as it was relieved from that oppression.\r\n      It is now the most important of the sugar colonies of the West Indies, and\r\n      its produce is said to be greater than that of all the English sugar\r\n      colonies put together. The other sugar colonies of France are in general\r\n      all very thriving.\r\n\r\n      But there are no colonies of which the progress has been more rapid than\r\n      that of the English in North America.\r\n\r\n      Plenty of good land, and liberty to manage their own affairs their own\r\n      way, seem to be the two great causes of the prosperity of all new\r\n      colonies.\r\n\r\n      In the plenty of good land, the English colonies of North America, though\r\n      no doubt very abundantly provided, are, however, inferior to those of the\r\n      Spaniards and Portuguese, and not superior to some of those possessed by\r\n      the French before the late war. But the political institutions of the\r\n      English colonies have been more favourable to the improvement and\r\n      cultivation of this land, than those of the other three nations.\r\n\r\n      First, The engrossing of uncultivated land, though it has by no means been\r\n      prevented altogether, has been more restrained in the English colonies\r\n      than in any other. The colony law, which imposes upon every proprietor the\r\n      obligation of improving and cultivating, within a limited time, a certain\r\n      proportion of his lands, and which, in case of failure, declares those\r\n      neglected lands grantable to any other person; though it has not perhaps\r\n      been very strictly executed, has, however, had some effect.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, In Pennsylvania there is no right of primogeniture, and lands,\r\n      like moveables, are divided equally among all the children of the family.\r\n      In three of the provinces of New England, the oldest has only a double\r\n      share, as in the Mosaical law. Though in those provinces, therefore, too\r\n      great a quantity of land should sometimes be engrossed by a particular\r\n      individual, it is likely, in the course of a generation or two, to be\r\n      sufficiently divided again. In the other English colonies, indeed, the\r\n      right of primogeniture takes place, as in the law of England: But in all\r\n      the English colonies, the tenure of the lands, which are all held by free\r\n      soccage, facilitates alienation; and the grantee of an extensive tract of\r\n      land generally finds it for his interest to alienate, as fast as he can,\r\n      the greater part of it, reserving only a small quit-rent. In the Spanish\r\n      and Portuguese colonies, what is called the right of majorazzo takes place\r\n      in the succession of all those great estates to which any title of honour\r\n      is annexed. Such estates go all to one person, and are in effect entailed\r\n      and unalienable. The French colonies, indeed, are subject to the custom of\r\n      Paris, which, in the inheritance of land, is much more favourable to the\r\n      younger children than the law of England. But, in the French colonies, if\r\n      any part of an estate, held by the noble tenure of chivalry and homage, is\r\n      alienated, it is, for a limited time, subject to the right of redemption,\r\n      either by the heir of the superior, or by the heir of the family; and all\r\n      the largest estates of the country are held by such noble tenures, which\r\n      necessarily embarrass alienation. But, in a new colony, a great\r\n      uncultivated estate is likely to be much more speedily divided by\r\n      alienation than by succession. The plenty and cheapness of good land, it\r\n      has already been observed, are the principal causes of the rapid\r\n      prosperity of new colonies. The engrossing of land, in effect, destroys\r\n      this plenty and cheapness. The engrossing of uncultivated land, besides,\r\n      is the greatest obstruction to its improvement; but the labour that is\r\n      employed in the improvement and cultivation of land affords the greatest\r\n      and most valuable produce to the society. The produce of labour, in this\r\n      case, pays not only its own wages and the profit of the stock which\r\n      employs it, but the rent of the land too upon which it is employed. The\r\n      labour of the English colonies, therefore, being more employed in the\r\n      improvement and cultivation of land, is likely to afford a greater and\r\n      more valuable produce than that of any of the other three nations, which,\r\n      by the engrossing of land, is more or less diverted towards other\r\n      employments.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, The labour of the English colonists is not only likely to afford\r\n      a greater and more valuable produce, but, in consequence of the moderation\r\n      of their taxes, a greater proportion of this produce belongs to\r\n      themselves, which they may store up and employ in putting into motion a\r\n      still greater quantity of labour. The English colonists have never yet\r\n      contributed any thing towards the defence of the mother country, or\r\n      towards the support of its civil government. They themselves, on the\r\n      contrary, have hitherto been defended almost entirely at the expense of\r\n      the mother country; but the expense of fleets and armies is out of all\r\n      proportion greater than the necessary expense of civil government. The\r\n      expense of their own civil government has always been very moderate. It\r\n      has generally been confined to what was necessary for paying competent\r\n      salaries to the governor, to the judges, and to some other officers of\r\n      police, and for maintaining a few of the most useful public works. The\r\n      expense of the civil establishment of Massachusetts Bay, before the\r\n      commencement of the present disturbances, used to be but about £18;000\r\n      a-year; that of New Hampshire and Rhode Island, £3500 each; that of\r\n      Connecticut, £4000; that of New York and Pennsylvania, £4500 each; that of\r\n      New Jersey, £1200; that of Virginia and South Carolina, £8000 each. The\r\n      civil establishments of Nova Scotia and Georgia are partly supported by an\r\n      annual grant of parliament; but Nova Scotia pays, besides, about £7000\r\n      a-year towards the public expenses of the colony, and Georgia about £2500\r\n      a-year. All the different civil establishments in North America, in short,\r\n      exclusive of those of Maryland and North Carolina, of which no exact\r\n      account has been got, did not, before the commencement of the present\r\n      disturbances, cost the inhabitants above £64,700 a-year; an ever memorable\r\n      example, at how small an expense three millions of people may not only be\r\n      governed but well governed. The most important part of the expense of\r\n      government, indeed, that of defence and protection, has constantly fallen\r\n      upon the mother country. The ceremonial, too, of the civil government in\r\n      the colonies, upon the reception of a new governor, upon the opening of a\r\n      new assembly, etc. though sufficiently decent, is not accompanied with any\r\n      expensive pomp or parade. Their ecclesiastical government is conducted\r\n      upon a plan equally frugal. Tithes are unknown among them; and their\r\n      clergy, who are far from being numerous, are maintained either by moderate\r\n      stipends, or by the voluntary contributions of the people. The power of\r\n      Spain and Portugal, on the contrary, derives some support from the taxes\r\n      levied upon their colonies. France, indeed, has never drawn any\r\n      considerable revenue from its colonies, the taxes which it levies upon\r\n      them being generally spent among them. But the colony government of all\r\n      these three nations is conducted upon a much more extensive plan, and is\r\n      accompanied with a much more expensive ceremonial. The sums spent upon the\r\n      reception of a new viceroy of Peru, for example, have frequently been\r\n      enormous. Such ceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich\r\n      colonists upon those particular occasions, but they serve to introduce\r\n      among them the habit of vanity and expense upon all other occasions. They\r\n      are not only very grievous occasional taxes, but they contribute to\r\n      establish perpetual taxes, of the same kind, still more grievous; the\r\n      ruinous taxes of private luxury and extravagance. In the colonies of all\r\n      those three nations, too, the ecclesiastical government is extremely\r\n      oppressive. Tithes take place in all of them, and are levied with the\r\n      utmost rigour in those of Spain and Portugal. All of them, besides, are\r\n      oppressed with a numerous race of mendicant friars, whose beggary being\r\n      not only licensed but consecrated by religion, is a most grievous tax upon\r\n      the poor people, who are most carefully taught that it is a duty to give,\r\n      and a very great sin to refuse them their charity. Over and above all\r\n      this, the clergy are, in all of them, the greatest engrossers of land.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, In the disposal of their surplus produce, or of what is over and\r\n      above their own consumption, the English colonies have been more favoured,\r\n      and have been allowed a more extensive market, than those of any other\r\n      European nation. Every European nation has endeavoured, more or less, to\r\n      monopolize to itself the commerce of its colonies, and, upon that account,\r\n      has prohibited the ships of foreign nations from trading to them, and has\r\n      prohibited them from importing European goods from any foreign nation. But\r\n      the manner in which this monopoly has been exercised in different nations,\r\n      has been very different.\r\n\r\n      Some nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to an\r\n      exclusive company, of whom the colonists were obliged to buy all such\r\n      European goods as they wanted, and to whom they were obliged to sell the\r\n      whole of their surplus produce. It was the interest of the company,\r\n      therefore, not only to sell the former as dear, and to buy the latter as\r\n      cheap as possible, but to buy no more of the latter, even at this low\r\n      price, than what they could dispose of for a very high price in Europe. It\r\n      was their interest not only to degrade in all cases the value of the\r\n      surplus produce of the colony, but in many cases to discourage and keep\r\n      down the natural increase of its quantity. Of all the expedients that can\r\n      well be contrived to stunt the natural growth of a new colony, that of an\r\n      exclusive company is undoubtedly the most effectual. This, however, has\r\n      been the policy of Holland, though their company, in the course of the\r\n      present century, has given up in many respects the exertion of their\r\n      exclusive privilege. This, too, was the policy of Denmark, till the reign\r\n      of the late king. It has occasionally been the policy of France; and of\r\n      late, since 1755, after it had been abandoned by all other nations on\r\n      account of its absurdity, it has become the policy of Portugal, with\r\n      regard at least to two of the principal provinces of Brazil, Pernambucco,\r\n      and Marannon.\r\n\r\n      Other nations, without establishing an exclusive company, have confined\r\n      the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular port of the mother\r\n      country, from whence no ship was allowed to sail, but either in a fleet\r\n      and at a particular season, or, if single, in consequence of a particular\r\n      license, which in most cases was very well paid for. This policy opened,\r\n      indeed, the trade of the colonies to all the natives of the mother\r\n      country, provided they traded from the proper port, at the proper season,\r\n      and in the proper vessels. But as all the different merchants, who joined\r\n      their stocks in order to fit out those licensed vessels, would find it for\r\n      their interest to act in concert, the trade which was carried on in this\r\n      manner would necessarily be conducted very nearly upon the same principles\r\n      as that of an exclusive company. The profit of those merchants would be\r\n      almost equally exorbitant and oppressive. The colonies would be ill\r\n      supplied, and would be obliged both to buy very dear, and to sell very\r\n      cheap. This, however, till within these few years, had always been the\r\n      policy of Spain; and the price of all European goods, accordingly, is said\r\n      to have been enormous in the Spanish West Indies. At Quito, we are told by\r\n      Ulloa, a pound of iron sold for about 4s:6d., and a pound of steel for\r\n      about 6s:9d. sterling. But it is chiefly in order to purchase European\r\n      goods that the colonies part with their own produce. The more, therefore,\r\n      they pay for the one, the less they really get for the other, and the\r\n      dearness of the one is the same thing with the cheapness of the other. The\r\n      policy of Portugal is, in this respect, the same as the ancient policy of\r\n      Spain, with regard to all its colonies, except Pernambucco and Marannon;\r\n      and with regard to these it has lately adopted a still worse.\r\n\r\n      Other nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their\r\n      subjects, who may carry it on from all the different ports of the mother\r\n      country, and who have occasion for no other license than the common\r\n      despatches of the custom-house. In this case the number and dispersed\r\n      situation of the different traders renders it impossible for them to enter\r\n      into any general combination, and their competition is sufficient to\r\n      hinder them from making very exorbitant profits. Under so liberal a\r\n      policy, the colonies are enabled both to sell their own produce, and to\r\n      buy the goods of Europe at a reasonable price; but since the dissolution\r\n      of the Plymouth company, when our colonies were but in their infancy, this\r\n      has always been the policy of England. It has generally, too, been that of\r\n      France, and has been uniformly so since the dissolution of what in England\r\n      is commonly called their Mississippi company. The profits of the trade,\r\n      therefore, which France and England carry on with their colonies, though\r\n      no doubt somewhat higher than if the competition were free to all other\r\n      nations, are, however, by no means exorbitant; and the price of European\r\n      goods, accordingly, is not extravagantly high in the greater past of the\r\n      colonies of either of those nations.\r\n\r\n      In the exportation of their own surplus produce, too, it is only with\r\n      regard to certain commodities that the colonies of Great Britain are\r\n      confined to the market of the mother country. These commodities having\r\n      been enumerated in the act of navigation, and in some other subsequent\r\n      acts, have upon that account been called enumerated commodities. The rest\r\n      are called non-enumerated, and may be exported directly to other\r\n      countries, provided it is in British or plantation ships, of which the\r\n      owners and three fourths of the mariners are British subjects.\r\n\r\n      Among the non-enumerated commodities are some of the most important\r\n      productions of America and the West Indies, grain of all sorts, lumber,\r\n      salt provisions, fish, sugar, and rum.\r\n\r\n      Grain is naturally the first and principal object of the culture of all\r\n      new colonies. By allowing them a very extensive market for it, the law\r\n      encourages them to extend this culture much beyond the consumption of a\r\n      thinly inhabited country, and thus to provide beforehand an ample\r\n      subsistence for a continually increasing population.\r\n\r\n      In a country quite covered with wood, where timber consequently is of\r\n      little or no value, the expense of clearing the ground is the principal\r\n      obstacle to improvement. By allowing the colonies a very extensive market\r\n      for their lumber, the law endeavours to facilitate improvement by raising\r\n      the price of a commodity which would otherwise be of little value, and\r\n      thereby enabling them to make some profit of what would otherwise be mere\r\n      expense.\r\n\r\n      In a country neither half peopled nor half cultivated, cattle naturally\r\n      multiply beyond the consumption of the inhabitants, and are often, upon\r\n      that account, of little or no value. But it is necessary, it has already\r\n      been shown, that the price of cattle should bear a certain proportion to\r\n      that of corn, before the greater part of the lands of any country can be\r\n      improved. By allowing to American cattle, in all shapes, dead and alive, a\r\n      very extensive market, the law endeavours to raise the value of a\r\n      commodity, of which the high price is so very essential to improvement.\r\n      The good effects of this liberty, however, must be somewhat diminished by\r\n      the 4th of Geo. III. c. 15, which puts hides and skins among the\r\n      enumerated commodities, and thereby tends to reduce the value of American\r\n      cattle.\r\n\r\n      To increase the shipping and naval power of Great Britain by the extension\r\n      of the fisheries of our colonies, is an object which the legislature seems\r\n      to have had almost constantly in view. Those fisheries, upon this account,\r\n      have had all the encouragement which freedom can give them, and they have\r\n      flourished accordingly. The New England fishery, in particular, was,\r\n      before the late disturbances, one of the most important, perhaps, in the\r\n      world. The whale fishery which, notwithstanding an extravagant bounty, is\r\n      in Great Britain carried on to so little purpose, that in the opinion of\r\n      many people ( which I do not, however, pretend to warrant), the whole\r\n      produce does not much exceed the value of the bounties which are annually\r\n      paid for it, is in New England carried on, without any bounty, to a very\r\n      great extent. Fish is one of the principal articles with which the North\r\n      Americans trade to Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n      Sugar was originally an enumerated commodity, which could only be exported\r\n      to Great Britain; but in 1751, upon a representation of the\r\n      sugar-planters, its exportation was permitted to all parts of the world.\r\n      The restrictions, however, with which this liberty was granted, joined to\r\n      the high price of sugar in Great Britain, have rendered it in a great\r\n      measure ineffectual. Great Britain and her colonies still continue to be\r\n      almost the sole market for all sugar produced in the British plantations.\r\n      Their consumption increases so fast, that, though in consequence of the\r\n      increasing improvement of Jamaica, as well as of the ceded islands, the\r\n      importation of sugar has increased very greatly within these twenty years,\r\n      the exportation to foreign countries is said to be not much greater than\r\n      before.\r\n\r\n      Rum is a very important article in the trade which the Americans carry on\r\n      to the coast of Africa, from which they bring back negro slaves in return.\r\n\r\n      If the whole surplus produce of America, in grain of all sorts, in salt\r\n      provisions, and in fish, had been put into the enumeration, and thereby\r\n      forced into the market of Great Britain, it would have interfered too much\r\n      with the produce of the industry of our own people. It was probably not so\r\n      much from any regard to the interest of America, as from a jealousy of\r\n      this interference, that those important commodities have not only been\r\n      kept out of the enumeration, but that the importation into Great Britain\r\n      of all grain, except rice, and of all salt provisions, has, in the\r\n      ordinary state of the law, been prohibited.\r\n\r\n      The non-enumerated commodities could originally be exported to all parts\r\n      of the world. Lumber and rice having been once put into the enumeration,\r\n      when they were afterwards taken out of it, were confined, as to the\r\n      European market, to the countries that lie south of Cape Finisterre. By\r\n      the 6th of George III. c. 52, all non-enumerated commodities were\r\n      subjected to the like restriction. The parts of Europe which lie south of\r\n      Cape Finisterre are not manufacturing countries, and we are less jealous\r\n      of the colony ships carrying home from them any manufactures which could\r\n      interfere with our own.\r\n\r\n      The enumerated commodities are of two sorts; first, such as are either the\r\n      peculiar produce of America, or as cannot be produced, or at least are not\r\n      produced in the mother country. Of this kind are molasses, coffee,\r\n      cocoa-nuts, tobacco, pimento, ginger, whalefins, raw silk, cotton, wool,\r\n      beaver, and other peltry of America, indigo, fustick, and other dyeing\r\n      woods; secondly, such as are not the peculiar produce of America, but\r\n      which are, and may be produced in the mother country, though not in such\r\n      quantities as to supply the greater part of her demand, which is\r\n      principally supplied from foreign countries. Of this kind are all naval\r\n      stores, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpentine, pig and\r\n      bar iron, copper ore, hides and skins, pot and pearl ashes. The largest\r\n      importation of commodities of the first kind could not discourage the\r\n      growth, or interfere with the sale, of any part of the produce of the\r\n      mother country. By confining them to the home market, our merchants, it\r\n      was expected, would not only be enabled to buy them cheaper in the\r\n      plantations, and consequently to sell them with a better profit at home,\r\n      but to establish between the plantations and foreign countries an\r\n      advantageous carrying trade, of which Great Britain was necessarily to be\r\n      the centre or emporium, as the European country into which those\r\n      commodities were first to be imported. The importation of commodities of\r\n      the second kind might be so managed too, it was supposed, as to interfere,\r\n      not with the sale of those of the same kind which were produced at home,\r\n      but with that of those which were imported from foreign countries;\r\n      because, by means of proper duties, they might be rendered always somewhat\r\n      dearer than the former, and yet a good deal cheaper than the latter. By\r\n      confining such commodities to the home market, therefore, it was proposed\r\n      to discourage the produce, not of Great Britain, but of some foreign\r\n      countries with which the balance of trade was believed to be unfavourable\r\n      to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      The prohibition of exporting from the colonies to any other country but\r\n      Great Britain, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpentine,\r\n      naturally tended to lower the price of timber in the colonies, and\r\n      consequently to increase the expense of clearing their lands, the\r\n      principal obstacle to their improvement. But about the beginning of the\r\n      present century, in 1703, the pitch and tar company of Sweden endeavoured\r\n      to raise the price of their commodities to Great Britain, by prohibiting\r\n      their exportation, except in their own ships, at their own price, and in\r\n      such quantities as they thought proper. In order to counteract this\r\n      notable piece of mercantile policy, and to render herself as much as\r\n      possible independent, not only of Sweden, but of all the other northern\r\n      powers, Great Britain gave a bounty upon the importation of naval stores\r\n      from America; and the effect of this bounty was to raise the price of\r\n      timber in America much more than the confinement to the home market could\r\n      lower it; and as both regulations were enacted at the same time, their\r\n      joint effect was rather to encourage than to discourage the clearing of\r\n      land in America.\r\n\r\n      Though pig and bar iron, too, have been put among the enumerated\r\n      commodities, yet as, when imported from America, they are exempted from\r\n      considerable duties to which they are subject when imported front any\r\n      other country, the one part of the regulation contributes more to\r\n      encourage the erection of furnaces in America than the other to discourage\r\n      it. There is no manufacture which occasions so great a consumption of wood\r\n      as a furnace, or which can contribute so much to the clearing of a country\r\n      overgrown with it.\r\n\r\n      The tendency of some of these regulations to raise the value of timber in\r\n      America, and thereby to facilitate the clearing of the land, was neither,\r\n      perhaps, intended nor understood by the legislature. Though their\r\n      beneficial effects, however, have been in this respect accidental, they\r\n      have not upon that account been less real.\r\n\r\n      The most perfect freedom of trade is permitted between the British\r\n      colonies of America and the West Indies, both in the enumerated and in the\r\n      non-enumerated commodities Those colonies are now become so populous and\r\n      thriving, that each of them finds in some of the others a great and\r\n      extensive market for every part of its produce. All of them taken\r\n      together, they make a great internal market for the produce of one\r\n      another.\r\n\r\n      The liberality of England, however, towards the trade of her colonies, has\r\n      been confined chiefly to what concerns the market for their produce,\r\n      either in its rude state, or in what may be called the very first stage of\r\n      manufacture. The more advanced or more refined manufactures, even of the\r\n      colony produce, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain chuse to\r\n      reserve to themselves, and have prevailed upon the legislature to prevent\r\n      their establishment in the colonies, sometimes by high duties, and\r\n      sometimes by absolute prohibitions.\r\n\r\n      While, for example, Muscovado sugars from the British plantations pay,\r\n      upon importation, only 6s:4d. the hundred weight, white sugars pay £1:1:1;\r\n      and refined, either double or single, in loaves, £4:2:5 ⁸⁄₂₀ths. When\r\n      those high duties were imposed, Great Britain was the sole, and she still\r\n      continues to be, the principal market, to which the sugars of the British\r\n      colonies could be exported. They amounted, therefore, to a prohibition, at\r\n      first of claying or refining sugar for any foreign market, and at present\r\n      of claying or refining it for the market which takes off, perhaps, more\r\n      than nine-tenths of the whole produce. The manufacture of claying or\r\n      refining sugar, accordingly, though it has flourished in all the sugar\r\n      colonies of France, has been little cultivated in any of those of England,\r\n      except for the market of the colonies themselves. While Grenada was in the\r\n      hands of the French, there was a refinery of sugar, by claying, at least\r\n      upon almost every plantation. Since it fell into those of the English,\r\n      almost all works of this kind have been given up; and there are at present\r\n      (October 1773), I am assured, not above two or three remaining in the\r\n      island. At present, however, by an indulgence of the custom-house, clayed\r\n      or refined sugar, if reduced from loaves into powder, is commonly imported\r\n      as Muscovado.\r\n\r\n      While Great Britain encourages in America the manufacturing of pig and bar\r\n      iron, by exempting them from duties to which the like commodities are\r\n      subject when imported from any other country, she imposes an absolute\r\n      prohibition upon the erection of steel furnaces and slit-mills in any of\r\n      her American plantations. She will not suffer her colonies to work in\r\n      those more refined manufactures, even for their own consumption; but\r\n      insists upon their purchasing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods\r\n      of this kind which they have occasion for.\r\n\r\n      She prohibits the exportation from one province to another by water, and\r\n      even the carriage by land upon horseback, or in a cart, of hats, of wools,\r\n      and woollen goods, of the produce of America; a regulation which\r\n      effectually prevents the establishment of any manufacture of such\r\n      commodities for distant sale, and confines the industry of her colonists\r\n      in this way to such coarse and household manufactures as a private family\r\n      commonly makes for its own use, or for that of some of its neighbours in\r\n      the same province.\r\n\r\n      To prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can of\r\n      every part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and\r\n      industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a\r\n      manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind. Unjust, however,\r\n      as such prohibitions may be, they have not hitherto been very hurtful to\r\n      the colonies. Land is still so cheap, and, consequently, labour so dear\r\n      among them, that they can import from the mother country almost all the\r\n      more refined or more advanced manufactures cheaper than they could make\r\n      them for themselves. Though they had not, therefore, been prohibited from\r\n      establishing such manufactures, yet, in their present state of\r\n      improvement, a regard to their own interest would probably have prevented\r\n      them from doing so. In their present state of improvement, those\r\n      prohibitions, perhaps, without cramping their industry, or restraining it\r\n      from any employment to which it would have gone of its own accord, are\r\n      only impertinent badges of slavery imposed upon them, without any\r\n      sufficient reason, by the groundless jealousy of the merchants and\r\n      manufacturers of the mother country. In a more advanced state, they might\r\n      be really oppressive and insupportable.\r\n\r\n      Great Britain, too, as she confines to her own market some of the most\r\n      important productions of the colonies, so, in compensation, she gives to\r\n      some of them an advantage in that market, sometimes by imposing higher\r\n      duties upon the like productions when imported from other countries, and\r\n      sometimes by giving bounties upon their importation from the colonies. In\r\n      the first way, she gives an advantage in the home market to the sugar,\r\n      tobacco, and iron of her own colonies; and, in the second, to their raw\r\n      silk, to their hemp and flax, to their indigo, to their naval stores, and\r\n      to their building timber. This second way of encouraging the colony\r\n      produce, by bounties upon importation, is, so far as I have been able to\r\n      learn, peculiar to Great Britain: the first is not. Portugal does not\r\n      content herself with imposing higher duties upon the importation of\r\n      tobacco from any other country, but prohibits it under the severest\r\n      penalties.\r\n\r\n      With regard to the importation of goods from Europe, England has likewise\r\n      dealt more liberally with her colonies than any other nation.\r\n\r\n      Great Britain allows a part, almost always the half, generally a larger\r\n      portion, and sometimes the whole, of the duty which is paid upon the\r\n      importation of foreign goods, to be drawn back upon their exportation to\r\n      any foreign country. No independent foreign country, it was easy to\r\n      foresee, would receive them, if they came to it loaded with the heavy\r\n      duties to which almost all foreign goods are subjected on their\r\n      importation into Great Britain. Unless, therefore, some part of those\r\n      duties was drawn back upon exportation, there was an end of the carrying\r\n      trade; a trade so much favoured by the mercantile system.\r\n\r\n      Our colonies, however, are by no means independent foreign countries; and\r\n      Great Britain having assumed to herself the exclusive right of supplying\r\n      them with all goods from Europe, might have forced them (in the same\r\n      manner as other countries have done their colonies) to receive such goods\r\n      loaded with all the same duties which they paid in the mother country.\r\n      But, on the contrary, till 1763, the same drawbacks were paid upon the\r\n      exportation of the greater part of foreign goods to our colonies, as to\r\n      any independent foreign country. In 1763, indeed, by the 4th of Geo. III.\r\n      c. 15, this indulgence was a good deal abated, and it was enacted, “That\r\n      no part of the duty called the old subsidy should be drawn back for any\r\n      goods of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe or the East\r\n      Indies, which should be exported from this kingdom to any British colony\r\n      or plantation in America; wines, white calicoes, and muslins, excepted.”\r\n      Before this law, many different sorts of foreign goods might have been\r\n      bought cheaper in the plantations than in the mother country, and some may\r\n      still.\r\n\r\n      Of the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade, the\r\n      merchants who carry it on, it must be observed, have been the principal\r\n      advisers. We must not wonder, therefore, if, in a great part of them,\r\n      their interest has been more considered than either that of the colonies\r\n      or that of the mother country. In their exclusive privilege of supplying\r\n      the colonies with all the goods which they wanted from Europe, and of\r\n      purchasing all such parts of their surplus produce as could not interfere\r\n      with any of the trades which they themselves carried on at home, the\r\n      interest of the colonies was sacrificed to the interest of those\r\n      merchants. In allowing the same drawbacks upon the re-exportation of the\r\n      greater part of European and East India goods to the colonies, as upon\r\n      their re-exportation to any independent country, the interest of the\r\n      mother country was sacrificed to it, even according to the mercantile\r\n      ideas of that interest. It was for the interest of the merchants to pay as\r\n      little as possible for the foreign goods which they sent to the colonies,\r\n      and, consequently, to get back as much as possible of the duties which\r\n      they advanced upon their importation into Great Britain. They might\r\n      thereby be enabled to sell in the colonies, either the same quantity of\r\n      goods with a greater profit, or a greater quantity with the same profit,\r\n      and, consequently, to gain something either in the one way or the other.\r\n      It was likewise for the interest of the colonies to get all such goods as\r\n      cheap, and in as great abundance as possible. But this might not always be\r\n      for the interest of the mother country. She might frequently suffer, both\r\n      in her revenue, by giving back a great part of the duties which had been\r\n      paid upon the importation of such goods; and in her manufactures, by being\r\n      undersold in the colony market, in consequence of the easy terms upon\r\n      which foreign manufactures could be carried thither by means of those\r\n      drawbacks. The progress of the linen manufacture of Great Britain, it is\r\n      commonly said, has been a good deal retarded by the drawbacks upon the\r\n      re-exportation of German linen to the American colonies.\r\n\r\n      But though the policy of Great Britain, with regard to the trade of her\r\n      colonies, has been dictated by the same mercantile spirit as that of other\r\n      nations, it has, however, upon the whole, been less illiberal and\r\n      oppressive than that of any of them.\r\n\r\n      In every thing except their foreign trade, the liberty of the English\r\n      colonists to manage their own affairs their own way, is complete. It is in\r\n      every respect equal to that of their fellow-citizens at home, and is\r\n      secured in the same manner, by an assembly of the representatives of the\r\n      people, who claim the sole right of imposing taxes for the support of the\r\n      colony government. The authority of this assembly overawes the executive\r\n      power; and neither the meanest nor the most obnoxious colonist, as long as\r\n      he obeys the law, has any thing to fear from the resentment, either of the\r\n      governor, or of any other civil or military officer in the province. The\r\n      colony assemblies, though, like the house of commons in England, they are\r\n      not always a very equal representation of the people, yet they approach\r\n      more nearly to that character; and as the executive power either has not\r\n      the means to corrupt them, or, on account of the support which it receives\r\n      from the mother country, is not under the necessity of doing so, they are,\r\n      perhaps, in general more influenced by the inclinations of their\r\n      constituents. The councils, which, in the colony legislatures, correspond\r\n      to the house of lords in Great Britain, are not composed of a hereditary\r\n      nobility. In some of the colonies, as in three of the governments of New\r\n      England, those councils are not appointed by the king, but chosen by the\r\n      representatives of the people. In none of the English colonies is there\r\n      any hereditary nobility. In all of them, indeed, as in all other free\r\n      countries, the descendant of an old colony family is more respected than\r\n      an upstart of equal merit and fortune; but he is only more respected, and\r\n      he has no privileges by which he can be troublesome to his neighbours.\r\n      Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the colony assemblies\r\n      had not only the legislative, but a part of the executive power. In\r\n      Connecticut and Rhode Island, they elected the governor. In the other\r\n      colonies, they appointed the revenue officers, who collected the taxes\r\n      imposed by those respective assemblies, to whom those officers were\r\n      immediately responsible. There is more equality, therefore, among the\r\n      English colonists than among the inhabitants of the mother country. Their\r\n      manners are more re publican; and their governments, those of three of the\r\n      provinces of New England in particular, have hitherto been more republican\r\n      too.\r\n\r\n      The absolute governments of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the contrary,\r\n      take place in their colonies; and the discretionary powers which such\r\n      governments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are, on\r\n      account of the great distance, naturally exercised there with more than\r\n      ordinary violence. Under all absolute governments, there is more liberty\r\n      in the capital than in any other part of the country. The sovereign\r\n      himself can never have either interest or inclination to pervert the order\r\n      of justice, or to oppress the great body of the people. In the capital,\r\n      his presence overawes, more or less, all his inferior officers, who, in\r\n      the remoter provinces, from whence the complaints of the people are less\r\n      likely to reach him, can exercise their tyranny with much more safety. But\r\n      the European colonies in America are more remote than the most distant\r\n      provinces of the greatest empires which had ever been known before. The\r\n      government of the English colonies is, perhaps, the only one which, since\r\n      the world began, could give perfect security to the inhabitants of so very\r\n      distant a province. The administration of the French colonies, however,\r\n      has always been conducted with much more gentleness and moderation than\r\n      that of the Spanish and Portuguese. This superiority of conduct is\r\n      suitable both to the character of the French nation, and to what forms the\r\n      character of every nation, the nature of their government, which, though\r\n      arbitrary and violent in comparison with that of Great Britain, is legal\r\n      and free in comparison with those of Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\n      It is in the progress of the North American colonies, however, that the\r\n      superiority of the English policy chiefly appears. The progress of the\r\n      sugar colonies of France has been at least equal, perhaps superior, to\r\n      that of the greater part of those of England; and yet the sugar colonies\r\n      of England enjoy a free government, nearly of the same kind with that\r\n      which takes place in her colonies of North America. But the sugar colonies\r\n      of France are not discouraged, like those of England, from refining their\r\n      own sugar; and what is still of greater importance, the genius of their\r\n      government naturally introduces a better management of their negro slaves.\r\n\r\n      In all European colonies, the culture of the sugar-cane is carried on by\r\n      negro slaves. The constitution of those who have been born in the\r\n      temperate climate of Europe could not, it is supposed, support the labour\r\n      of digging the ground under the burning sun of the West Indies; and the\r\n      culture of the sugar-cane, as it is managed at present, is all hand\r\n      labour; though, in the opinion of many, the drill plough might be\r\n      introduced into it with great advantage. But, as the profit and success of\r\n      the cultivation which is carried on by means of cattle, depend very much\r\n      upon the good management of those cattle; so the profit and success of\r\n      that which is carried on by slaves must depend equally upon the good\r\n      management of those slaves; and in the good management of their slaves the\r\n      French planters, I think it is generally allowed, are superior to the\r\n      English. The law, so far as it gives some weak protection to the slave\r\n      against the violence of his master, is likely to be better executed in a\r\n      colony where the government is in a great measure arbitrary, than in one\r\n      where it is altogether free. In every country where the unfortunate law\r\n      of slavery is established, the magistrate, when he protects the slave,\r\n      intermeddles in some measure in the management of the private property of\r\n      the master; and, in a free country, where the master is, perhaps, either a\r\n      member of the colony assembly, or an elector of such a member, he dares\r\n      not do this but with the greatest caution and circumspection. The respect\r\n      which he is obliged to pay to the master, renders it more difficult for\r\n      him to protect the slave. But in a country where the government is in a\r\n      great measure arbitrary, where it is usual for the magistrate to\r\n      intermeddle even in the management of the private property of individuals,\r\n      and to send them, perhaps, a lettre de cachet, if they do not manage it\r\n      according to his liking, it is much easier for him to give some protection\r\n      to the slave; and common humanity naturally disposes him to do so. The\r\n      protection of the magistrate renders the slave less contemptible in the\r\n      eyes of his master, who is thereby induced to consider him with more\r\n      regard, and to treat him with more gentleness. Gentle usage renders the\r\n      slave not only more faithful, but more intelligent, and, therefore, upon a\r\n      double account, more useful. He approaches more to the condition of a free\r\n      servant, and may possess some degree of integrity and attachment to his\r\n      master’s interest; virtues which frequently belong to free servants, but\r\n      which never can belong to a slave, who is treated as slaves commonly are\r\n      in countries where the master is perfectly free and secure.\r\n\r\n      That the condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary than under a\r\n      free government, is, I believe, supported by the history of all ages and\r\n      nations. In the Roman history, the first time we read of the magistrate\r\n      interposing to protect the slave from the violence of his master, is under\r\n      the emperors. When Vidius Pollio, in the presence of Augustus, ordered one\r\n      of his slaves, who had committed a slight fault, to be cut into pieces and\r\n      thrown into his fish-pond, in order to feed his fishes, the emperor\r\n      commanded him, with indignation, to emancipate immediately, not only that\r\n      slave, but all the others that belonged to him. Under the republic no\r\n      magistrate could have had authority enough to protect the slave, much less\r\n      to punish the master.\r\n\r\n      The stock, it is to be observed, which has improved the sugar colonies of\r\n      France, particularly the great colony of St Domingo, has been raised\r\n      almost entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation of those\r\n      colonies. It has been almost altogether the produce of the soil and of the\r\n      industry of the colonists, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of\r\n      that produce, gradually accumulated by good management, and employed in\r\n      raising a still greater produce. But the stock which has improved and\r\n      cultivated the sugar colonies of England, has, a great part of it, been\r\n      sent out from England, and has by no means been altogether the produce of\r\n      the soil and industry of the colonists. The prosperity of the English\r\n      sugar colonies has been in a great measure owing to the great riches of\r\n      England, of which a part has overflowed, if one may say so, upon these\r\n      colonies. But the prosperity of the sugar colonies of France has been\r\n      entirely owing to the good conduct of the colonists, which must therefore\r\n      have had some superiority over that of the English; and this superiority\r\n      has been remarked in nothing so much as in the good management of their\r\n      slaves.\r\n\r\n      Such have been the general outlines of the policy of the different\r\n      European nations with regard to their colonies.\r\n\r\n      The policy of Europe, therefore, has very little to boast of, either in\r\n      the original establishment, or, so far as concerns their internal\r\n      government, in the subsequent prosperity of the colonies of America.\r\n\r\n      Folly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided over\r\n      and directed the first project of establishing those colonies; the folly\r\n      of hunting after gold and silver mines, and the injustice of coveting the\r\n      possession of a country whose harmless natives, far from having ever\r\n      injured the people of Europe, had received the first adventurers with\r\n      every mark of kindness and hospitality.\r\n\r\n      The adventurers, indeed, who formed some of the latter establishments,\r\n      joined to the chimerical project of finding gold and silver mines, other\r\n      motives more reasonable and more laudable; but even these motives do very\r\n      little honour to the policy of Europe.\r\n\r\n      The English puritans, restrained at home, fled for freedom to America, and\r\n      established there the four governments of New England. The English\r\n      catholics, treated with much greater injustice, established that of\r\n      Maryland; the quakers, that of Pennsylvania. The Portuguese Jews,\r\n      persecuted by the inquisition, stript of their fortunes, and banished to\r\n      Brazil, introduced, by their example, some sort of order and industry\r\n      among the transported felons and strumpets by whom that colony was\r\n      originally peopled, and taught them the culture of the sugar-cane. Upon\r\n      all these different occasions, it was not the wisdom and policy, but the\r\n      disorder and injustice of the European governments, which peopled and\r\n      cultivated America.\r\n\r\n      In effectuation some of the most important of these establishments, the\r\n      different governments of Europe had as little merit as in projecting them.\r\n      The conquest of Mexico was the project, not of the council of Spain, but\r\n      of a governor of Cuba; and it was effectuated by the spirit of the bold\r\n      adventurer to whom it was entrusted, in spite of every thing which that\r\n      governor, who soon repented of having trusted such a person, could do to\r\n      thwart it. The conquerors of Chili and Peru, and of almost all the other\r\n      Spanish settlements upon the continent of America, carried out with them\r\n      no other public encouragement, but a general permission to make\r\n      settlements and conquests in the name of the king of Spain. Those\r\n      adventures were all at the private risk and expense of the adventurers.\r\n      The government of Spain contributed scarce any thing to any of them. That\r\n      of England contributed as little towards effectuating the establishment of\r\n      some of its most important colonies in North America.\r\n\r\n      When those establishments were effectuated, and had become so considerable\r\n      as to attract the attention of the mother country, the first regulations\r\n      which she made with regard to them, had always in view to secure to\r\n      herself the monopoly of their commerce; to confine their market, and to\r\n      enlarge her own at their expense, and, consequently, rather to damp and\r\n      discourage, than to quicken and forward the course of their prosperity. In\r\n      the different ways in which this monopoly has been exercised, consists one\r\n      of the most essential differences in the policy of the different European\r\n      nations with regard to their colonies. The best of them all, that of\r\n      England, is only somewhat less illiberal and oppressive than that of any\r\n      of the rest.\r\n\r\n      In what way, therefore, has the policy of Europe contributed either to the\r\n      first establishment, or to the present grandeur of the colonies of\r\n      America? In one way, and in one way only, it has contributed a good deal.\r\n      Magna virum mater! It bred and formed the men who were capable of\r\n      achieving such great actions, and of laying the foundation of so great an\r\n      empire; and there is no other quarter of the world; of which the policy is\r\n      capable of forming, or has ever actually, and in fact, formed such men.\r\n      The colonies owe to the policy of Europe the education and great views of\r\n      their active and enterprizing founders; and some of the greatest and most\r\n      important of them, so far as concerns their internal government, owe to it\r\n      scarce anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART III. Of the Advantages which Europe has derived From the Discovery of\r\n      America, and from that of a Passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good\r\n      Hope.\r\n\r\n      Such are the advantages which the colonies of America have derived from\r\n      the policy of Europe.\r\n\r\n      What are those which Europe has derived from the discovery and\r\n      colonization of America?\r\n\r\n      Those advantages may be divided, first, into the general advantages which\r\n      Europe, considered as one great country, has derived from those great\r\n      events; and, secondly, into the particular advantages which each\r\n      colonizing country has derived from the colonies which particularly belong\r\n      to it, in consequence of the authority or dominion which it exercises over\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      The general advantages which Europe, considered as one great country, has\r\n      derived from the discovery and colonization of America, consist, first, in\r\n      the increase of its enjoyments; and, secondly, in the augmentation of its\r\n      industry.\r\n\r\n      The surplus produce of America imported into Europe, furnishes the\r\n      inhabitants of this great continent with a variety of commodities which\r\n      they could not otherwise have possessed; some for conveniency and use,\r\n      some for pleasure, and some for ornament; and thereby contributes to\r\n      increase their enjoyments.\r\n\r\n      The discovery and colonization of America, it will readily be allowed,\r\n      have contributed to augment the industry, first, of all the countries\r\n      which trade to it directly, such as Spain, Portugal, France, and England;\r\n      and, secondly, of all those which, without trading to it directly, send,\r\n      through the medium of other countries, goods to it of their own produce,\r\n      such as Austrian Flanders, and some provinces of Germany, which, through\r\n      the medium of the countries before mentioned, send to it a considerable\r\n      quantity of linen and other goods. All such countries have evidently\r\n      gained a more extensive market for their surplus produce, and must\r\n      consequently have been encouraged to increase its quantity.\r\n\r\n      But that those great events should likewise have contributed to encourage\r\n      the industry of countries such as Hungary and Poland, which may never,\r\n      perhaps, have sent a single commodity of their own produce to America, is\r\n      not, perhaps, altogether so evident. That those events have done so,\r\n      however, cannot be doubted. Some part of the produce of America is\r\n      consumed in Hungary and Poland, and there is some demand there for the\r\n      sugar, chocolate, and tobacco, of that new quarter of the world. But those\r\n      commodities must be purchased with something which is either the produce\r\n      of the industry of Hungary and Poland, or with something which had been\r\n      purchased with some part of that produce. Those commodities of America are\r\n      new values, new equivalents, introduced into Hungary and Poland, to be\r\n      exchanged there for the surplus produce of these countries. By being\r\n      carried thither, they create a new and more extensive market for that\r\n      surplus produce. They raise its value, and thereby contribute to encourage\r\n      its increase. Though no part of it may ever be carried to America, it may\r\n      be carried to other countries, which purchase it with a part of their\r\n      share of the surplus produce of America, and it may find a market by means\r\n      of the circulation of that trade which was originally put into motion by\r\n      the surplus produce of America.\r\n\r\n      Those great events may even have contributed to increase the enjoyments,\r\n      and to augment the industry, of countries which not only never sent any\r\n      commodities to America, but never received any from it. Even such\r\n      countries may have received a greater abundance of other commodities from\r\n      countries, of which the surplus produce had been augmented by means of the\r\n      American trade. This greater abundance, as it must necessarily have\r\n      increased their enjoyments, so it must likewise have augmented their\r\n      industry. A greater number of new equivalents, of some kind or other, must\r\n      have been presented to them to be exchanged for the surplus produce of\r\n      that industry. A more extensive market must have been created for that\r\n      surplus produce, so as to raise its value, and thereby encourage its\r\n      increase. The mass of commodities annually thrown into the great circle of\r\n      European commerce, and by its various revolutions annually distributed\r\n      among all the different nations comprehended within it, must have been\r\n      augmented by the whole surplus produce of America. A greater share of this\r\n      greater mass, therefore, is likely to have fallen to each of those\r\n      nations, to have increased their enjoyments, and augmented their industry.\r\n\r\n      The exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish, or at least\r\n      to keep down below what they would otherwise rise to, both the enjoyments\r\n      and industry of all those nations in general, and of the American colonies\r\n      in particular. It is a dead weight upon the action of one of the great\r\n      springs which puts into motion a great part of the business of mankind. By\r\n      rendering the colony produce dearer in all other countries, it lessens its\r\n      consumption, and thereby cramps the industry of the colonies, and both the\r\n      enjoyments and the industry of all other countries, which both enjoy less\r\n      when they pay more for what they enjoy, and produce less when they get\r\n      less for what they produce. By rendering the produce of all other\r\n      countries dearer in the colonies, it cramps in the same manner the\r\n      industry of all other colonies, and both the enjoyments and the industry\r\n      of the colonies. It is a clog which, for the supposed benefit of some\r\n      particular countries, embarrasses the pleasures and encumbers the industry\r\n      of all other countries, but of the colonies more than of any other. It not\r\n      only excludes as much as possible all other countries from one particular\r\n      market, but it confines as much as possible the colonies to one particular\r\n      market; and the difference is very great between being excluded from one\r\n      particular market when all others are open, and being confined to one\r\n      particular market when all others are shut up. The surplus produce of the\r\n      colonies, however, is the original source of all that increase of\r\n      enjoyments and industry which Europe derives from the discovery and\r\n      colonization of America, and the exclusive trade of the mother countries\r\n      tends to render this source much less abundant than it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\n      The particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from the\r\n      colonies which particularly belong to it, are of two different kinds;\r\n      first, those common advantages which every empire derives from the\r\n      provinces subject to its dominion; and, secondly, those peculiar\r\n      advantages which are supposed to result from provinces of so very peculiar\r\n      a nature as the European colonies of America.\r\n\r\n      The common advantages which every empire derives from the provinces\r\n      subject to its dominion consist, first, in the military force which they\r\n      furnish for its defence; and, secondly, in the revenue which they furnish\r\n      for the support of its civil government. The Roman colonies furnished\r\n      occasionally both the one and the other. The Greek colonies sometimes\r\n      furnished a military force, but seldom any revenue. They seldom\r\n      acknowledged themselves subject to the dominion of the mother city. They\r\n      were generally her allies in war, but very seldom her subjects in peace.\r\n\r\n      The European colonies of America have never yet furnished any military\r\n      force for the defence of the mother country. The military force has never\r\n      yet been sufficient for their own defence; and in the different wars in\r\n      which the mother countries have been engaged, the defence of their\r\n      colonies has generally occasioned a very considerable distraction of the\r\n      military force of those countries. In this respect, therefore, all the\r\n      European colonies have, without exception, been a cause rather of weakness\r\n      than of strength to their respective mother countries.\r\n\r\n      The colonies of Spain and Portugal only have contributed any revenue\r\n      towards the defence of the mother country, or the support of her civil\r\n      government. The taxes which have been levied upon those of other European\r\n      nations, upon those of England in particular, have seldom been equal to\r\n      the expense laid out upon them in time of peace, and never sufficient to\r\n      defray that which they occasioned in time of war. Such colonies,\r\n      therefore, have been a source of expense, and not of revenue, to their\r\n      respective mother countries.\r\n\r\n      The advantages of such colonies to their respective mother countries,\r\n      consist altogether in those peculiar advantages which are supposed to\r\n      result from provinces of so very peculiar a nature as the European\r\n      colonies of America; and the exclusive trade, it is acknowledged, is the\r\n      sole source of all those peculiar advantages.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of this exclusive trade, all that part of the surplus\r\n      produce of the English colonies, for example, which consists in what are\r\n      called enumerated commodities, can be sent to no other country but\r\n      England. Other countries must afterwards buy it of her. It must be\r\n      cheaper, therefore, in England than it can be in any other country, and\r\n      must contribute more to increase the enjoyments of England than those of\r\n      any other country. It must likewise contribute more to encourage her\r\n      industry. For all those parts of her own surplus produce which England\r\n      exchanges for those enumerated commodities, she must get a better price\r\n      than any other countries can get for the like parts of theirs, when they\r\n      exchange them for the same commodities. The manufactures of England, for\r\n      example, will purchase a greater quantity of the sugar and tobacco of her\r\n      own colonies than the like manufactures of other countries can purchase of\r\n      that sugar and tobacco. So far, therefore, as the manufactures of England\r\n      and those of other countries are both to be exchanged for the sugar and\r\n      tobacco of the English colonies, this superiority of price gives an\r\n      encouragement to the former beyond what the latter can, in these\r\n      circumstances, enjoy. The exclusive trade of the colonies, therefore, as\r\n      it diminishes, or at least keeps down below what they would otherwise rise\r\n      to, both the enjoyments and the industry of the countries which do not\r\n      possess it, so it gives an evident advantage to the countries which do\r\n      possess it over those other countries.\r\n\r\n      This advantage, however, will, perhaps, be found to be rather what may be\r\n      called a relative than an absolute advantage, and to give a superiority to\r\n      the country which enjoys it, rather by depressing the industry and produce\r\n      of other countries, than by raising those of that particular country above\r\n      what they would naturally rise to in the case of a free trade.\r\n\r\n      The tobacco of Maryland and Virginia, for example, by means of the\r\n      monopoly which England enjoys of it, certainly comes cheaper to England\r\n      than it can do to France to whom England commonly sells a considerable\r\n      part of it. But had France and all other European countries been at all\r\n      times allowed a free trade to Maryland and Virginia, the tobacco of those\r\n      colonies might by this time have come cheaper than it actually does, not\r\n      only to all those other countries, but likewise to England. The produce of\r\n      tobacco, in consequence of a market so much more extensive than any which\r\n      it has hitherto enjoyed, might, and probably would, by this time have been\r\n      so much increased as to reduce the profits of a tobacco plantation to\r\n      their natural level with those of a corn plantation, which it is supposed\r\n      they are still somewhat above. The price of tobacco might, and probably\r\n      would, by this time have fallen somewhat lower than it is at present. An\r\n      equal quantity of the commodities, either of England or of those other\r\n      countries, might have purchased in Maryland and Virginia a greater\r\n      quantity of tobacco than it can do at present, and consequently have been\r\n      sold there for so much a better price. So far as that weed, therefore,\r\n      can, by its cheapness and abundance, increase the enjoyments, or augment\r\n      the industry, either of England or of any other country, it would\r\n      probably, in the case of a free trade, have produced both these effects in\r\n      somewhat a greater degree than it can do at present. England, indeed,\r\n      would not, in this case, have had any advantage over other countries. She\r\n      might have bought the tobacco of her colonies somewhat cheaper, and\r\n      consequently have sold some of her own commodities somewhat dearer, than\r\n      she actually does; but she could neither have bought the one cheaper, nor\r\n      sold the other dearer, than any other country might have done. She might,\r\n      perhaps, have gained an absolute, but she would certainly have lost a\r\n      relative advantage.\r\n\r\n      In order, however, to obtain this relative advantage in the colony trade,\r\n      in order to execute the invidious and malignant project of excluding, as\r\n      much as possible, other nations from any share in it, England, there are\r\n      very probable reasons for believing, has not only sacrificed a part of the\r\n      absolute advantage which she, as well as every other nation, might have\r\n      derived from that trade, but has subjected herself both to an absolute and\r\n      to a relative disadvantage in almost every other branch of trade.\r\n\r\n      When, by the act of navigation, England assumed to herself the monopoly of\r\n      the colony trade, the foreign capitals which had before been employed in\r\n      it, were necessarily withdrawn from it. The English capital, which had\r\n      before carried on but a part of it, was now to carry on the whole. The\r\n      capital which had before supplied the colonies with but a part of the\r\n      goods which they wanted from Europe, was now all that was employed to\r\n      supply them with the whole. But it could not supply them with the whole;\r\n      and the goods with which it did supply them were necessarily sold very\r\n      dear. The capital which had before bought but a part of the surplus\r\n      produce of the colonies, was now all that was employed to buy the whole.\r\n      But it could not buy the whole at any thing near the old price; and\r\n      therefore, whatever it did buy, it necessarily bought very cheap. But in\r\n      an employment of capital, in which the merchant sold very dear, and bought\r\n      very cheap, the profit must have been very great, and much above the\r\n      ordinary level of profit in other branches of trade. This superiority of\r\n      profit in the colony trade could not fail to draw from other branches of\r\n      trade a part of the capital which had before been employed in them. But\r\n      this revulsion of capital, as it must have gradually increased the\r\n      competition of capitals in the colony trade, so it must have gradually\r\n      diminished that competition in all those other branches of trade; as it\r\n      must have gradually lowered the profits of the one, so it must have\r\n      gradually raised those of the other, till the profits of all came to a new\r\n      level, different from, and somewhat higher, than that at which they had\r\n      been before.\r\n\r\n      This double effect of drawing capital from all other trades, and of\r\n      raising the rate of profit somewhat higher than it otherwise would have\r\n      been in all trades, was not only produced by this monopoly upon its first\r\n      establishment, but has continued to be produced by it ever since.\r\n\r\n      First, This monopoly has been continually drawing capital from all other\r\n      trades, to be employed in that of the colonies.\r\n\r\n      Though the wealth of Great Britain has increased very much since the\r\n      establishment of the act of navigation, it certainly has not increased in\r\n      the same proportion as that or the colonies. But the foreign trade of\r\n      every country naturally increases in proportion to its wealth, its surplus\r\n      produce in proportion to its whole produce; and Great Britain having\r\n      engrossed to herself almost the whole of what may be called the foreign\r\n      trade of the colonies, and her capital not having increased in the same\r\n      proportion as the extent of that trade, she could not carry it on without\r\n      continually withdrawing from other branches of trade some part of the\r\n      capital which had before been employed in them, as well as withholding\r\n      from them a great deal more which would otherwise have gone to them. Since\r\n      the establishment of the act of navigation, accordingly, the colony trade\r\n      has been continually increasing, while many other branches of foreign\r\n      trade, particularly of that to other parts of Europe, have been\r\n      continually decaying. Our manufactures for foreign sale, instead of being\r\n      suited, as before the act of navigation, to the neighbouring market of\r\n      Europe, or to the more distant one of the countries which lie round the\r\n      Mediterranean sea, have the greater part of them, been accommodated to the\r\n      still more distant one of the colonies; to the market in which they have\r\n      the monopoly, rather than to that in which they have many competitors. The\r\n      causes of decay in other branches of foreign trade, which, by Sir Matthew\r\n      Decker and other writers, have been sought for in the excess and improper\r\n      mode of taxation, in the high price of labour, in the increase of luxury,\r\n      etc. may all be found in the overgrowth of the colony trade. The\r\n      mercantile capital of Great Britain, though very great, yet not being\r\n      infinite, and though greatly increased since the act of navigation, yet\r\n      not being increased in the same proportion as the colony trade, that trade\r\n      could not possibly be carried on without withdrawing some part of that\r\n      capital from other branches of trade, nor consequently without some decay\r\n      of those other branches.\r\n\r\n      England, it must be observed, was a great trading country, her mercantile\r\n      capital was very great, and likely to become still greater and greater\r\n      every day, not only before the act of navigation had established the\r\n      monopoly of the corn trade, but before that trade was very considerable.\r\n      In the Dutch war, during the government of Cromwell, her navy was superior\r\n      to that of Holland; and in that which broke out in the beginning of the\r\n      reign of Charles II., it was at least equal, perhaps superior to the\r\n      united navies of France and Holland. Its superiority, perhaps, would\r\n      scarce appear greater in the present times, at least if the Dutch navy\r\n      were to bear the same proportion to the Dutch commerce now which it did\r\n      then. But this great naval power could not, in either of those wars, be\r\n      owing to the act of navigation. During the first of them, the plan of that\r\n      act had been but just formed; and though, before the breaking out of the\r\n      second, it had been fully enacted by legal authority, yet no part of it\r\n      could have had time to produce any considerable effect, and least of all\r\n      that part which established the exclusive trade to the colonies. Both the\r\n      colonies and their trade were inconsiderable then, in comparison of what\r\n      they are how. The island of Jamaica was an unwholesome desert, little\r\n      inhabited, and less cultivated. New York and New Jersey were in the\r\n      possession of the Dutch, the half of St. Christopher’s in that of the\r\n      French. The island of Antigua, the two Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Georgia,\r\n      and Nova Scotia, were not planted. Virginia, Maryland, and New England\r\n      were planted; and though they were very thriving colonies, yet there was\r\n      not perhaps at that time, either in Europe or America, a single person who\r\n      foresaw, or even suspected, the rapid progress which they have since made\r\n      in wealth, population, and improvement. The island of Barbadoes, in short,\r\n      was the only British colony of any consequence, of which the condition at\r\n      that time bore any resemblance to what it is at present. The trade of the\r\n      colonies, of which England, even for some time after the act of\r\n      navigation, enjoyed but a part (for the act of navigation was not very\r\n      strictly executed till several years after it was enacted), could not at\r\n      that time be the cause of the great trade of England, nor of the great\r\n      naval power which was supported by that trade. The trade which at that\r\n      time supported that great naval power was the trade of Europe, and of the\r\n      countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea. But the share which Great\r\n      Britain at present enjoys of that trade could not support any such great\r\n      naval power. Had the growing trade of the colonies been left free to all\r\n      nations, whatever share of it might have fallen to Great Britain, and a\r\n      very considerable share would probably have fallen to her, must have been\r\n      all an addition to this great trade of which she was before in possession.\r\n      In consequence of the monopoly, the increase of the colony trade has not\r\n      so much occasioned an addition to the trade which Great Britain had\r\n      before, as a total change in its direction.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, This monopoly has necessarily contributed to keep up the rate of\r\n      profit, in all the different branches of British trade, higher than it\r\n      naturally would have been, had all nations been allowed a free trade to\r\n      the British colonies.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly of the colony trade, as it necessarily drew towards that\r\n      trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would\r\n      have gone to it of its own accord, so, by the expulsion of all foreign\r\n      capitals, it necessarily reduced the whole quantity of capital employed in\r\n      that trade below what it naturally would have been in the case of a free\r\n      trade. But, by lessening the competition of capitals in that branch of\r\n      trade, it necessarily raised the rate of profit in that branch. By\r\n      lessening, too, the competition of British capitals in all other branches\r\n      of trade, it necessarily raised the rate of British profit in all those\r\n      other branches. Whatever may have been, at any particular period since the\r\n      establishment of the act of navigation, the state or extent of the\r\n      mercantile capital of Great Britain, the monopoly of the colony trade\r\n      must, during the continuance of that state, have raised the ordinary rate\r\n      of British profit higher than it otherwise would have been, both in that\r\n      and in all the other branches of British trade. If, since the\r\n      establishment of the act of navigation, the ordinary rate of British\r\n      profit has fallen considerably, as it certainly has, it must have fallen\r\n      still lower, had not the monopoly established by that act contributed to\r\n      keep it up.\r\n\r\n      But whatever raises, in any country, the ordinary rate of profit higher\r\n      than it otherwise would be, necessarily subjects that country both to an\r\n      absolute, and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which\r\n      she has not the monopoly.\r\n\r\n      It subjects her to an absolute disadvantage; because, in such branches of\r\n      trade, her merchants cannot get this greater profit without selling dearer\r\n      than they otherwise would do, both the goods of foreign countries which\r\n      they import into their own, and the goods of their own country which they\r\n      export to foreign countries. Their own country must both buy dearer and\r\n      sell dearer; must both buy less, and sell less; must both enjoy less and\r\n      produce less, than she otherwise would do.\r\n\r\n      It subjects her to a relative disadvantage; because, in such branches of\r\n      trade, it sets other countries, which are not subject to the same absolute\r\n      disadvantage, either more above her or less below her, than they otherwise\r\n      would be. It enables them both to enjoy more and to produce more, in\r\n      proportion to what she enjoys and produces. It renders their superiority\r\n      greater, or their inferiority less, than it otherwise would be. By raising\r\n      the price of her produce above what it otherwise would be, it enables the\r\n      merchants of other countries to undersell her in foreign markets, and\r\n      thereby to justle her out of almost all those branches of trade, of which\r\n      she has not the monopoly.\r\n\r\n      Our merchants frequently complain of the high wages of British labour, as\r\n      the cause of their manufactures being undersold in foreign markets; but\r\n      they are silent about the high profits of stock. They complain of the\r\n      extravagant gain of other people; but they say nothing of their own. The\r\n      high profits of British stock, however, may contribute towards raising the\r\n      price of British manufactures, in many cases, as much, and in some perhaps\r\n      more, than the high wages of British labour.\r\n\r\n      It is in this manner that the capital of Great Britain, one may justly\r\n      say, has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part of\r\n      the different branches of trade of which she has not the monopoly; from\r\n      the trade of Europe, in particular, and from that of the countries which\r\n      lie round the Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\n      It has partly been drawn from those branches of trade, by the attraction\r\n      of superior profit in the colony trade, in consequence of the continual\r\n      increase of that trade, and of the continual insufficiency of the capital\r\n      which had carried it on one year to carry it on the next.\r\n\r\n      It has partly been driven from them, by the advantage which the high rate\r\n      of profit established in Great Britain gives to other countries, in all\r\n      the different branches of trade of which Great Britain has not the\r\n      monopoly.\r\n\r\n      As the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from those other branches a\r\n      part of the British capital, which would otherwise have been employed in\r\n      them, so it has forced into them many foreign capitals which would never\r\n      have gone to them, had they not been expelled from the colony trade. In\r\n      those other branches of trade, it has diminished the competition of\r\n      British capitals, and thereby raised the rate of British profit higher\r\n      than it otherwise would have been. On the contrary, it has increased the\r\n      competition of foreign capitals, and thereby sunk the rate of foreign\r\n      profit lower than it otherwise would have been. Both in the one way and in\r\n      the other, it must evidently have subjected Great Britain to a relative\r\n      disadvantage in all those other branches of trade.\r\n\r\n      The colony trade, however, it may perhaps be said, is more advantageous to\r\n      Great Britain than any other; and the monopoly, by forcing into that trade\r\n      a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would\r\n      otherwise have gone to it, has turned that capital into an employment,\r\n      more advantageous to the country than any other which it could have found.\r\n\r\n      The most advantageous employment of any capital to the country to which it\r\n      belongs, is that which maintains there the greatest quantity of productive\r\n      labour, and increases the most the annual produce of the land and labour\r\n      of that country. But the quantity of productive labour which any capital\r\n      employed in the foreign trade of consumption can maintain, is exactly in\r\n      proportion, it has been shown in the second book, to the frequency of its\r\n      returns. A capital of a thousand pounds, for example, employed in a\r\n      foreign trade of consumption, of which the returns are made regularly once\r\n      in the year, can keep in constant employment, in the country to which it\r\n      belongs, a quantity of productive labour, equal to what a thousand pounds\r\n      can maintain there for a year. If the returns are made twice or thrice in\r\n      the year, it can keep in constant employment a quantity of productive\r\n      labour, equal to what two or three thousand pounds can maintain there for\r\n      a year. A foreign trade of consumption carried on with a neighbouring, is,\r\n      upon that account, in general, more advantageous than one carried on with\r\n      a distant country; and, for the same reason, a direct foreign trade of\r\n      consumption, as it has likewise been shown in the second book, is in\r\n      general more advantageous than a round-about one.\r\n\r\n      But the monopoly of the colony trade, so far as it has operated upon the\r\n      employment of the capital of Great Britain, has, in all cases, forced some\r\n      part of it from a foreign trade of consumption carried on with a\r\n      neighbouring, to one carried on with a more distant country, and in many\r\n      cases from a direct foreign trade of consumption to a round-about one.\r\n\r\n      First, The monopoly of the colony trade has, in all cases, forced some\r\n      part of the capital of Great Britain from a foreign trade of consumption\r\n      carried on with a neighbouring, to one carried on with a more distant\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      It has, in all cases, forced some part of that capital from the trade with\r\n      Europe, and with the countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea, to\r\n      that with the more distant regions of America and the West Indies; from\r\n      which the returns are necessarily less frequent, not only on account of\r\n      the greater distance, but on account of the peculiar circumstances of\r\n      those countries. New colonies, it has already been observed, are always\r\n      understocked. Their capital is always much less than what they could\r\n      employ with great profit and advantage in the improvement and cultivation\r\n      of their land. They have a constant demand, therefore, for more capital\r\n      than they have of their own; and, in order to supply the deficiency of\r\n      their own, they endeavour to borrow as much as they can of the mother\r\n      country, to whom they are, therefore, always in debt. The most common way\r\n      in which the colonies contract this debt, is not by borrowing upon bond of\r\n      the rich people of the mother country, though they sometimes do this too,\r\n      but by running as much in arrear to their correspondents, who supply them\r\n      with goods from Europe, as those correspondents will allow them. Their\r\n      annual returns frequently do not amount to more than a third, and\r\n      sometimes not to so great a proportion of what they owe. The whole\r\n      capital, therefore, which their correspondents advance to them, is seldom\r\n      returned to Britain in less than three, and sometimes not in less than\r\n      four or five years. But a British capital of a thousand pounds, for\r\n      example, which is returned to Great Britain only once in five years, can\r\n      keep in constant employment only one-fifth part of the British industry\r\n      which it could maintain, if the whole was returned once in the year; and,\r\n      instead of the quantity of industry which a thousand pounds could maintain\r\n      for a year, can keep in constant employment the quantity only which two\r\n      hundred pounds can maintain for a year. The planter, no doubt, by the high\r\n      price which he pays for the goods from Europe, by the interest upon the\r\n      bills which he grants at distant dates, and by the commission upon the\r\n      renewal of those which he grants at near dates, makes up, and probably\r\n      more than makes up, all the loss which his correspondent can sustain by\r\n      this delay. But, though he make up the loss of his correspondent, he\r\n      cannot make up that of Great Britain. In a trade of which the returns are\r\n      very distant, the profit of the merchant may be as great or greater than\r\n      in one in which they are very frequent and near; but the advantage of the\r\n      country in which he resides, the quantity of productive labour constantly\r\n      maintained there, the annual produce of the land and labour, must always\r\n      be much less. That the returns of the trade to America, and still more\r\n      those of that to the West Indies, are, in general, not only more distant,\r\n      but more irregular and more uncertain, too, than those of the trade to any\r\n      part of Europe, or even of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean\r\n      sea, will readily be allowed, I imagine, by everybody who has any\r\n      experience of those different branches of trade.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, The monopoly of the colony trade, has, in many cases, forced\r\n      some part of the capital of Great Britain from a direct foreign trade of\r\n      consumption, into a round-about one.\r\n\r\n      Among the enumerated commodities which can be sent to no other market but\r\n      Great Britain, there are several of which the quantity exceeds very much\r\n      the consumption of Great Britain, and of which, a part, therefore, must be\r\n      exported to other countries. But this cannot be done without forcing some\r\n      part of the capital of Great Britain into a round-about foreign trade of\r\n      consumption. Maryland, and Virginia, for example, send annually to Great\r\n      Britain upwards of ninety-six thousand hogsheads of tobacco, and the\r\n      consumption of Great Britain is said not to exceed fourteen thousand.\r\n      Upwards of eighty-two thousand hogsheads, therefore, must be exported to\r\n      other countries, to France, to Holland, and, to the countries which lie\r\n      round the Baltic and Mediterranean seas. But that part of the capital of\r\n      Great Britain which brings those eighty-two thousand hogsheads to Great\r\n      Britain, which re-exports them from thence to those other countries, and\r\n      which brings back from those other countries to Great Britain either goods\r\n      or money in return, is employed in a round-about foreign trade of\r\n      consumption; and is necessarily forced into this employment, in order to\r\n      dispose of this great surplus. If we would compute in how many years the\r\n      whole of this capital is likely to come back to Great Britain, we must add\r\n      to the distance of the American returns that of the returns from those\r\n      other countries. If, in the direct foreign trade of consumption which we\r\n      carry on with America, the whole capital employed frequently does not come\r\n      back in less than three or four years, the whole capital employed in this\r\n      round-about one is not likely to come back in less than four or five. If\r\n      the one can keep in constant employment but a third or a fourth part of\r\n      the domestic industry which could be maintained by a capital returned once\r\n      in the year, the other can keep in constant employment but a fourth or a\r\n      fifth part of that industry. At some of the outports a credit is commonly\r\n      given to those foreign correspondents to whom they export them tobacco. At\r\n      the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money: the rule\r\n      is Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of\r\n      the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from\r\n      America, by the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse;\r\n      where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough. But, had not the\r\n      colonies been confined to the market of Great Britain for the sale of\r\n      their tobacco, very little more of it would probably have come to us than\r\n      what was necessary for the home consumption. The goods which Great Britain\r\n      purchases at present for her own consumption with the great surplus of\r\n      tobacco which she exports to other countries, she would, in this case,\r\n      probably have purchased with the immediate produce of her own industry, or\r\n      with some part of her own manufactures. That produce, those manufactures,\r\n      instead of being almost entirely suited to one great market, as at\r\n      present, would probably have been fitted to a great number of smaller\r\n      markets. Instead of one great round-about foreign trade of consumption,\r\n      Great Britain would probably have carried on a great number of small\r\n      direct foreign trades of the same kind. On account of the frequency of the\r\n      returns, a part, and probably but a small part, perhaps not above a third\r\n      or a fourth of the capital which at present carries on this great\r\n      round-about trade, might have been sufficient to carry on all those small\r\n      direct ones; might have kept in constant employment an equal quantity of\r\n      British industry; and have equally supported the annual produce of the\r\n      land and labour of Great Britain. All the purposes of this trade being, in\r\n      this manner, answered by a much smaller capital, there would have been a\r\n      large spare capital to apply to other purposes; to improve the lands, to\r\n      increase the manufactures, and to extend the commerce of Great Britain; to\r\n      come into competition at least with the other British capitals employed in\r\n      all those different ways, to reduce the rate of profit in them all, and\r\n      thereby to give to Great Britain, in all of them, a superiority over other\r\n      countries, still greater than what she at present enjoys.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly of the colony trade, too, has forced some part of the capital\r\n      of Great Britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a carrying\r\n      trade; and, consequently from supporting more or less the industry of\r\n      Great Britain, to be employed altogether in supporting partly that of the\r\n      colonies, and partly that of some other countries.\r\n\r\n      The goods, for example, which are annually purchased with the great\r\n      surplus of eighty-two thousand hogsheads of tobacco annually re-exported\r\n      from Great Britain, are not all consumed in Great Britain. Part of them,\r\n      linen from Germany and Holland, for example, is returned to the colonies\r\n      for their particular consumption. But that part of the capital of Great\r\n      Britain which buys the tobacco with which this linen is afterwards bought,\r\n      is necessarily withdrawn from supporting the industry of Great Britain, to\r\n      be employed altogether in supporting, partly that of the colonies, and\r\n      partly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the\r\n      produce of their own industry.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly of the colony trade, besides, by forcing towards it a much\r\n      greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would\r\n      naturally have gone to it, seems to have broken altogether that natural\r\n      balance which would otherwise have taken place among all the different\r\n      branches of British industry. The industry of Great Britain, instead of\r\n      being accommodated to a great number of small markets, has been\r\n      principally suited to one great market. Her commerce, instead of running\r\n      in a great number of small channels, has been taught to run principally in\r\n      one great channel. But the whole system of her industry and commerce has\r\n      thereby been rendered less secure; the whole state of her body politic\r\n      less healthful than it otherwise would have been. In her present\r\n      condition, Great Britain resembles one of those unwholesome bodies in\r\n      which some of the vital parts are overgrown, and which, upon that account,\r\n      are liable to many dangerous disorders, scarce incident to those in which\r\n      all the parts are more properly proportioned. A small stop in that great\r\n      blood-vessel, which has been artificially swelled beyond its natural\r\n      dimensions, and through which an unnatural proportion of the industry and\r\n      commerce of the country has been forced to circulate, is very likely to\r\n      bring on the most dangerous disorders upon the whole body politic. The\r\n      expectation of a rupture with the colonies, accordingly, has struck the\r\n      people of Great Britain with more terror than they ever felt for a Spanish\r\n      armada, or a French invasion. It was this terror, whether well or ill\r\n      grounded, which rendered the repeal of the stamp act, among the merchants\r\n      at least, a popular measure. In the total exclusion from the colony\r\n      market, was it to last only for a few years, the greater part of our\r\n      merchants used to fancy that they foresaw an entire stop to their trade;\r\n      the greater part of our master manufacturers, the entire ruin of their\r\n      business; and the greater part of our workmen, an end of their employment.\r\n      A rupture with any of our neighbours upon the continent, though likely,\r\n      too, to occasion some stop or interruption in the employments of some of\r\n      all these different orders of people, is foreseen, however, without any\r\n      such general emotion. The blood, of which the circulation is stopt in some\r\n      of the smaller vessels, easily disgorges itself into the greater, without\r\n      occasioning any dangerous disorder; but, when it is stopt in any of the\r\n      greater vessels, convulsions, apoplexy, or death, are the immediate and\r\n      unavoidable consequences. If but one of those overgrown manufactures,\r\n      which, by means either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and\r\n      colony markets, have been artificially raised up to any unnatural height,\r\n      finds some small stop or interruption in its employment, it frequently\r\n      occasions a mutiny and disorder alarming to government, and embarrassing\r\n      even to the deliberations of the legislature. How great, therefore, would\r\n      be the disorder and confusion, it was thought, which must necessarily be\r\n      occasioned by a sudden and entire stop in the employment of so great a\r\n      proportion of our principal manufacturers?\r\n\r\n      Some moderate and gradual relaxation of the laws which give to Great\r\n      Britain the exclusive trade to the colonies, till it is rendered in a\r\n      great measure free, seems to be the only expedient which can, in all\r\n      future times, deliver her from this danger; which can enable her, or even\r\n      force her, to withdraw some part of her capital from this overgrown\r\n      employment, and to turn it, though with less profit, towards other\r\n      employments; and which, by gradually diminishing one branch of her\r\n      industry, and gradually increasing all the rest, can, by degrees, restore\r\n      all the different branches of it to that natural, healthful, and proper\r\n      proportion, which perfect liberty necessarily establishes, and which\r\n      perfect liberty can alone preserve. To open the colony trade all at once\r\n      to all nations, might not only occasion some transitory inconveniency, but\r\n      a great permanent loss, to the greater part of those whose industry or\r\n      capital is at present engaged in it. The sudden loss of the employment,\r\n      even of the ships which import the eighty-two thousand hogsheads of\r\n      tobacco, which are over and above the consumption of Great Britain, might\r\n      alone be felt very sensibly. Such are the unfortunate effects of all the\r\n      regulations of the mercantile system. They not only introduce very\r\n      dangerous disorders into the state of the body politic, but disorders\r\n      which it is often difficult to remedy, without occasioning, for a time at\r\n      least, still greater disorders. In what manner, therefore, the colony\r\n      trade ought gradually to be opened; what are the restraints which ought\r\n      first, and what are those which ought last, to be taken away; or in what\r\n      manner the natural system of perfect liberty and justice ought gradually\r\n      to be restored, we must leave to the wisdom of future statesmen and\r\n      legislators to determine.\r\n\r\n      Five different events, unforeseen and unthought of, have very fortunately\r\n      concurred to hinder Great Britain from feeling, so sensibly as it was\r\n      generally expected she would, the total exclusion which has now taken\r\n      place for more than a year (from the first of December 1774) from a very\r\n      important branch of the colony trade, that of the twelve associated\r\n      provinces of North America. First, those colonies, in preparing themselves\r\n      for their non-importation agreement, drained Great Britain completely of\r\n      all the commodities which were fit for their market; secondly, the extra\r\n      ordinary demand of the Spanish flota has, this year, drained Germany and\r\n      the north of many commodities, linen in particular, which used to come\r\n      into competition, even in the British market, with the manufactures of\r\n      Great Britain; thirdly, the peace between Russia and Turkey has occasioned\r\n      an extraordinary demand from the Turkey market, which, during the distress\r\n      of the country, and while a Russian fleet was cruizing in the Archipelago,\r\n      had been very poorly supplied; fourthly, the demand of the north of Europe\r\n      for the manufactures of Great Britain has been increasing from year to\r\n      year, for some time past; and, fifthly, the late partition, and\r\n      consequential pacification of Poland, by opening the market of that great\r\n      country, have, this year, added an extraordinary demand from thence to the\r\n      increasing demand of the north. These events are all, except the fourth,\r\n      in their nature transitory and accidental; and the exclusion from so\r\n      important a branch of the colony trade, if unfortunately it should\r\n      continue much longer, may still occasion some degree of distress. This\r\n      distress, however, as it will come on gradually, will be felt much less\r\n      severely than if it had come on all at once; and, in the mean time, the\r\n      industry and capital of the country may find a new employment and\r\n      direction, so as to prevent this distress from ever rising to any\r\n      considerable height.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, so far as it has turned\r\n      towards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain\r\n      than what would otherwise have gone to it, has in all cases turned it,\r\n      from a foreign trade of consumption with a neighbouring, into one with a\r\n      more distant country; in many cases from a direct foreign trade of\r\n      consumption into a round-about one; and, in some cases, from all foreign\r\n      trade of consumption into a carrying trade. It has, in all cases,\r\n      therefore, turned it from a direction in which it would have maintained a\r\n      greater quantity of productive labour, into one in which it can maintain a\r\n      much smaller quantity. By suiting, besides, to one particular market only,\r\n      so great a part of the industry and commerce of Great Britain, it has\r\n      rendered the whole state of that industry and commerce more precarious and\r\n      less secure, than if their produce had been accommodated to a greater\r\n      variety of markets.\r\n\r\n      We must carefully distinguish between the effects of the colony trade and\r\n      those of the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and necessarily\r\n      beneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful. But the former are\r\n      so beneficial, that the colony trade, though subject to a monopoly, and,\r\n      notwithstanding the hurtful effects of that monopoly, is still, upon the\r\n      whole, beneficial, and greatly beneficial, though a good deal less so than\r\n      it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\n      The effect of the colony trade, in its natural and free state, is to open\r\n      a great though distant market, for such parts of the produce of British\r\n      industry as may exceed the demand of the markets nearer home, of those of\r\n      Europe, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea. In its\r\n      natural and free state, the colony trade, without drawing from those\r\n      markets any part of the produce which had ever been sent to them,\r\n      encourages Great Britain to increase the surplus continually, by\r\n      continually presenting new equivalents to be exchanged for it. In its\r\n      natural and free state, the colony trade tends to increase the quantity of\r\n      productive labour in Great Britain, but without altering in any respect\r\n      the direction of that which had been employed there before. In the natural\r\n      and free state of the colony trade, the competition of all other nations\r\n      would hinder the rate of profit from rising above the common level, either\r\n      in the new market, or in the new employment. The new market, without\r\n      drawing any thing from the old one, would create, if one may say so, a new\r\n      produce for its own supply; and that new produce would constitute a new\r\n      capital for carrying on the new employment, which, in the same manner,\r\n      would draw nothing from the old one.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly of the colony trade, on the contrary, by excluding the\r\n      competition of other nations, and thereby raising the rate of profit, both\r\n      in the new market and in the new employment, draws produce from the old\r\n      market, and capital from the old employment. To augment our share of the\r\n      colony trade beyond what it otherwise would be, is the avowed purpose of\r\n      the monopoly. If our share of that trade were to be no greater with, than\r\n      it would have been without the monopoly, there could have been no reason\r\n      for establishing the monopoly. But whatever forces into a branch of trade,\r\n      of which the returns are slower and more distant than those of the greater\r\n      part of other trades, a greater proportion of the capital of any country,\r\n      than what of its own accord would go to that branch, necessarily renders\r\n      the whole quantity of productive labour annually maintained there, the\r\n      whole annual produce of the land and labour of that country, less than\r\n      they otherwise would be. It keeps down the revenue of the inhabitants of\r\n      that country below what it would naturally rise to, and thereby diminishes\r\n      their power of accumulation. It not only hinders, at all times, their\r\n      capital from maintaining so great a quantity of productive labour as it\r\n      would otherwise maintain, but it hinders it from increasing so fast as it\r\n      would otherwise increase, and, consequently, from maintaining a still\r\n      greater quantity of productive labour.\r\n\r\n      The natural good effects of the colony trade, however, more than\r\n      counterbalance to Great Britain the bad effects of the monopoly; so that,\r\n      monopoly and altogether, that trade, even as it is carried on at present,\r\n      is not only advantageous, but greatly advantageous. The new market and the\r\n      new employment which are opened by the colony trade, are of much greater\r\n      extent than that portion of the old market and of the old employment which\r\n      is lost by the monopoly. The new produce and the new capital which has\r\n      been created, if one may say so, by the colony trade, maintain in Great\r\n      Britain a greater quantity of productive labour than what can have been\r\n      thrown out of employment by the revulsion of capital from other trades of\r\n      which the returns are more frequent. If the colony trade, however, even as\r\n      it is carried on at present, is advantageous to Great Britain, it is not\r\n      by means of the monopoly, but in spite of the monopoly.\r\n\r\n      It is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of Europe,\r\n      that the colony trade opens a new market. Agriculture is the proper\r\n      business of all new colonies; a business which the cheapness of land\r\n      renders more advantageous than any other. They abound, therefore, in the\r\n      rude produce of land; and instead of importing it from other countries,\r\n      they have generally a large surplus to export. In new colonies,\r\n      agriculture either draws hands from all other employments, or keeps them\r\n      from going to any other employment. There are few hands to spare for the\r\n      necessary, and none for the ornamental manufactures. The greater part of\r\n      the manufactures of both kinds they find it cheaper to purchase of other\r\n      countries than to make for themselves. It is chiefly by encouraging the\r\n      manufactures of Europe, that the colony trade indirectly encourages its\r\n      agriculture. The manufacturers of Europe, to whom that trade gives\r\n      employment, constitute a new market for the produce of the land, and the\r\n      most advantageous of all markets; the home market for the corn and cattle,\r\n      for the bread and butcher’s meat of Europe, is thus greatly extended by\r\n      means of the trade to America.\r\n\r\n      But that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies is\r\n      not alone sufficient to establish, or even to maintain, manufactures in\r\n      any country, the examples of Spain and Portugal sufficiently demonstrate.\r\n      Spain and Portugal were manufacturing countries before they had any\r\n      considerable colonies. Since they had the richest and most fertile in the\r\n      world, they have both ceased to be so.\r\n\r\n      In Spain and Portugal, the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by\r\n      other causes, have, perhaps, nearly overbalanced the natural good effects\r\n      of the colony trade. These causes seem to be other monopolies of different\r\n      kinds: the degradation of the value of gold and silver below what it is in\r\n      most other countries; the exclusion from foreign markets by improper taxes\r\n      upon exportation, and the narrowing of the home market, by still more\r\n      improper taxes upon the transportation of goods from one part of the\r\n      country to another; but above all, that irregular and partial\r\n      administration of justice which often protects the rich and powerful\r\n      debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the\r\n      industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for the consumption\r\n      of those haughty and great men, to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon\r\n      credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\r\n\r\n      In England, on the contrary, the natural good effects of the colony trade,\r\n      assisted by other causes, have in a great measure conquered the bad\r\n      effects of the monopoly. These causes seem to be, the general liberty of\r\n      trade, which, notwithstanding some restraints, is at least equal, perhaps\r\n      superior, to what it is in any other country; the liberty of exporting,\r\n      duty free, almost all sorts of goods which are the produce of domestic\r\n      industry, to almost any foreign country; and what, perhaps, is of still\r\n      greater importance, the unbounded liberty of transporting them from one\r\n      part of our own country to any other, without being obliged to give any\r\n      account to any public office, without being liable to question or\r\n      examination of any kind; but, above all, that equal and impartial\r\n      administration of justice, which renders the rights of the meanest British\r\n      subject respectable to the greatest, and which, by securing to every man\r\n      the fruits of his own industry, gives the greatest and most effectual\r\n      encouragement to every sort of industry.\r\n\r\n      If the manufactures of Great Britain, however, have been advanced, as they\r\n      certainly have, by the colony trade, it has not been by means of the\r\n      monopoly of that trade, but in spite of the monopoly. The effect of the\r\n      monopoly has been, not to augment the quantity, but to alter the quality\r\n      and shape of a part of the manufactures of Great Britain, and to\r\n      accommodate to a market, from which the returns are slow and distant, what\r\n      would otherwise have been accommodated to one from which the returns are\r\n      frequent and near. Its effect has consequently been, to turn a part of the\r\n      capital of Great Britain from an employment in which it would have\r\n      maintained a greater quantity of manufacturing industry, to one in which\r\n      it maintains a much smaller, and thereby to diminish, instead of\r\n      increasing, the whole quantity of manufacturing industry maintained in\r\n      Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, like all the other mean and\r\n      malignant expedients of the mercantile system, depresses the industry of\r\n      all other countries, but chiefly that of the colonies, without in the\r\n      least increasing, but on the contrary diminishing, that of the country in\r\n      whose favour it is established.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly hinders the capital of that country, whatever may, at any\r\n      particular time, be the extent of that capital, from maintaining so great\r\n      a quantity of productive labour as it would otherwise maintain, and from\r\n      affording so great a revenue to the industrious inhabitants as it would\r\n      otherwise afford. But as capital can be increased only by savings from\r\n      revenue, the monopoly, by hindering it from affording so great a revenue\r\n      as it would otherwise afford, necessarily hinders it from increasing so\r\n      fast as it would otherwise increase, and consequently from maintaining a\r\n      still greater quantity of productive labour, and affording a still greater\r\n      revenue to the industrious inhabitants of that country. One great original\r\n      source of revenue, therefore, the wages of labour, the monopoly must\r\n      necessarily have rendered, at all times, less abundant than it otherwise\r\n      would have been.\r\n\r\n      By raising the rate of mercantile profit, the monopoly discourages the\r\n      improvement of land. The profit of improvement depends upon the difference\r\n      between what the land actually produces, and what, by the application of a\r\n      certain capital, it can be made to produce. If this difference affords a\r\n      greater profit than what can be drawn from an equal capital in any\r\n      mercantile employment, the improvement of land will draw capital from all\r\n      mercantile employments. If the profit is less, mercantile employments will\r\n      draw capital from the improvement of land. Whatever, therefore, raises the\r\n      rate of mercantile profit, either lessens the superiority, or increases\r\n      the inferiority of the profit of improvement: and, in the one case,\r\n      hinders capital from going to improvement, and in the other draws capital\r\n      from it; but by discouraging improvement, the monopoly necessarily retards\r\n      the natural increase of another great original source of revenue, the rent\r\n      of land. By raising the rate of profit, too, the monopoly necessarily\r\n      keeps up the market rate of interest higher than it otherwise would be.\r\n      But the price of land, in proportion to the rent which it affords, the\r\n      number of years purchase which is commonly paid for it, necessarily falls\r\n      as the rate of interest rises, and rises as the rate of interest falls.\r\n      The monopoly, therefore, hurts the interest of the landlord two different\r\n      ways, by retarding the natural increase, first, of his rent, and,\r\n      secondly, of the price which he would get for his land, in proportion to\r\n      the rent which it affords.\r\n\r\n      The monopoly, indeed, raises the rate of mercantile profit and thereby\r\n      augments somewhat the gain of our merchants. But as it obstructs the\r\n      natural increase of capital, it tends rather to diminish than to increase\r\n      the sum total of the revenue which the inhabitants of the country derive\r\n      from the profits of stock; a small profit upon a great capital generally\r\n      affording a greater revenue than a great profit upon a small one. The\r\n      monopoly raises the rate of profit, but it hinders the sum of profit from\r\n      rising so high as it otherwise would do.\r\n\r\n      All the original sources of revenue, the wages of labour, the rent of\r\n      land, and the profits of stock, the monopoly renders much less abundant\r\n      than they otherwise would be. To promote the little interest of one little\r\n      order of men in one country, it hurts the interest of all other orders of\r\n      men in that country, and of all the men in all other countries.\r\n\r\n      It is solely by raising the ordinary rate of profit, that the monopoly\r\n      either has proved, or could prove, advantageous to any one particular\r\n      order of men. But besides all the bad effects to the country in general,\r\n      which have already been mentioned as necessarily resulting from a higher\r\n      rate of profit, there is one more fatal, perhaps, than all these put\r\n      together, but which, if we may judge from experience, is inseparably\r\n      connected with it. The high rate of profit seems everywhere to destroy\r\n      that parsimony which, in other circumstances, is natural to the character\r\n      of the merchant. When profits are high, that sober virtue seems to be\r\n      superfluous, and expensive luxury to suit better the affluence of his\r\n      situation. But the owners of the great mercantile capitals are necessarily\r\n      the leaders and conductors of the whole industry of every nation; and\r\n      their example has a much greater influence upon the manners of the whole\r\n      industrious part of it than that of any other order of men. If his\r\n      employer is attentive and parsimonious, the workman is very likely to be\r\n      so too; but if the master is dissolute and disorderly, the servant, who\r\n      shapes his work according to the pattern which his master prescribes to\r\n      him, will shape his life, too, according to the example which he sets him.\r\n      Accumulation is thus prevented in the hands of all those who are naturally\r\n      the most disposed to accumulate; and the funds destined for the\r\n      maintenance of productive labour, receive no augmentation from the revenue\r\n      of those who ought naturally to augment them the most. The capital of the\r\n      country, instead of increasing, gradually dwindles away, and the quantity\r\n      of productive labour maintained in it grows every day less and less. Have\r\n      the exorbitant profits of the merchants of Cadiz and Lisbon augmented the\r\n      capital of Spain and Portugal? Have they alleviated the poverty, have they\r\n      promoted the industry, of those two beggarly countries? Such has been the\r\n      tone of mercantile expense in those two trading cities, that those\r\n      exorbitant profits, far from augmenting the general capital of the\r\n      country, seem scarce to have been sufficient to keep up the capitals upon\r\n      which they were made. Foreign capitals are every day intruding themselves,\r\n      if I may say so, more and more into the trade of Cadiz and Lisbon. It is\r\n      to expel those foreign capitals from a trade which their own grows every\r\n      day more and more insufficient for carrying on, that the Spaniards and\r\n      Portuguese endeavour every day to straiten more and more the galling bands\r\n      of their absurd monopoly. Compare the mercantile manners of Cadiz and\r\n      Lisbon with those of Amsterdam, and you will be sensible how differently\r\n      the conduct and character of merchants are affected by the high and by the\r\n      low profits of stock. The merchants of London, indeed, have not yet\r\n      generally become such magnificent lords as those of Cadiz and Lisbon; but\r\n      neither are they in general such attetitive and parsimonious burghers as\r\n      those of Amsterdam. They are supposed, however, many of them, to be a good\r\n      deal richer than the greater part of the former, and not quire so rich as\r\n      many of the latter: but the rate of their profit is commonly much lower\r\n      than that of the former, and a good deal higher than that of the latter.\r\n      Light come, light go, says the proverb; and the ordinary tone of expense\r\n      seems everywhere to be regulated, not so much according to the real\r\n      ability of spending, as to the supposed facility of getting money to\r\n      spend.\r\n\r\n      It is thus that the single advantage which the monopoly procures to a\r\n      single order of men, is in many different ways hurtful to the general\r\n      interest of the country.\r\n\r\n      To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of\r\n      customers, may at first sight, appear a project fit only for a nation of\r\n      shopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of\r\n      shopkeepers, but extremely fit for a nation whose government is influenced\r\n      by shopkeepers. Such statesmen, and such statesmen only, are capable of\r\n      fancying that they will find some advantage in employing the blood and\r\n      treasure of their fellow-citizens, to found and maintain such an empire.\r\n      Say to a shopkeeper, Buy me a good estate, and I shall always buy my\r\n      clothes at your shop, even though I should pay somewhat dearer than what I\r\n      can have them for at other shops; and you will not find him very forward\r\n      to embrace your proposal. But should any other person buy you such an\r\n      estate, the shopkeeper will be much obliged to your benefactor if he would\r\n      enjoin you to buy all your clothes at his shop. England purchased for some\r\n      of her subjects, who found themselves uneasy at home, a great estate in a\r\n      distant country. The price, indeed, was very small, and instead of thirty\r\n      years purchase, the ordinary price of land in the present times, it\r\n      amounted to little more than the expense of the different equipments which\r\n      made the first discovery, reconnoitered the coast, and took a fictitious\r\n      possession of the country. The land was good, and of great extent; and the\r\n      cultivators having plenty of good ground to work upon, and being for some\r\n      time at liberty to sell their produce where they pleased, became, in the\r\n      course of little more than thirty or forty years (between 1620 and 1660),\r\n      so numerous and thriving a people, that the shopkeepers and other traders\r\n      of England wished to secure to themselves the monopoly of their custom.\r\n      Without pretending, therefore, that they had paid any part, either of the\r\n      original purchase money, or of the subsequent expense of improvement, they\r\n      petitioned the parliament, that the cultivators of America might for the\r\n      future be confined to their shop; first, for buying all the goods which\r\n      they wanted from Europe; and, secondly, for selling all such parts of\r\n      their own produce as those traders might find it convenient to buy. For\r\n      they did not find it convenient to buy every part of it. Some parts of it\r\n      imported into England, might have interfered with some of the trades which\r\n      they themselves carried on at home. Those particular parts of it,\r\n      therefore, they were willing that the colonists should sell where they\r\n      could; the farther off the better; and upon that account proposed that\r\n      their market should be confined to the countries south of Cape Finisterre.\r\n      A clause in the famous act of navigation established this truly shopkeeper\r\n      proposal into a law.\r\n\r\n      The maintenance of this monopoly has hitherto been the principal, or more\r\n      properly, perhaps, the sole end and purpose of the dominion which Great\r\n      Britain assumes over her colonies. In the exclusive trade, it is supposed,\r\n      consists the great advantage of provinces, which have never yet afforded\r\n      either revenue or military force for the support of the civil government,\r\n      or the defence of the mother country. The monopoly is the principal badge\r\n      of their dependency, and it is the sole fruit which has hitherto been\r\n      gathered from that dependency. Whatever expense Great Britain has hitherto\r\n      laid out in maintaining this dependency, has really been laid out in order\r\n      to support this monopoly. The expense of the ordinary peace establishment\r\n      of the colonies amounted, before the commencement of the present\r\n      disturbances to the pay of twenty regiments of foot; to the expense of the\r\n      artillery, stores, and extraordinary provisions, with which it was\r\n      necessary to supply them; and to the expense of a very considerable naval\r\n      force, which was constantly kept up, in order to guard from the smuggling\r\n      vessels of other nations, the immense coast of North America, and that of\r\n      our West Indian islands. The whole expense of this peace establishment was\r\n      a charge upon the revenue of Great Britain, and was, at the same time, the\r\n      smallest part of what the dominion of the colonies has cost the mother\r\n      country. If we would know the amount of the whole, we must add to the\r\n      annual expense of this peace establishment, the interest of the sums\r\n      which, in consequence of their considering her colonies as provinces\r\n      subject to her dominion, Great Britain has, upon different occasions, laid\r\n      out upon their defence. We must add to it, in particular, the whole\r\n      expense of the late war, and a great part of that of the war which\r\n      preceded it. The late war was altogether a colony quarrel; and the whole\r\n      expense of it, in whatever part of the world it might have been laid out,\r\n      whether in Germany or the East Indies, ought justly to be stated to the\r\n      account of the colonies. It amounted to more than ninety millions\r\n      sterling, including not only the new debt which was contracted, but the\r\n      two shillings in the pound additional land tax, and the sums which were\r\n      every year borrowed from the sinking fund. The Spanish war which began in\r\n      1739 was principally a colony quarrel. Its principal object was to prevent\r\n      the search of the colony ships, which carried on a contraband trade with\r\n      the Spanish Main. This whole expense is, in reality, a bounty which has\r\n      been given in order to support a monopoly. The pretended purpose of it was\r\n      to encourage the manufactures, and to increase the commerce of Great\r\n      Britain. But its real effect has been to raise the rate of mercantile\r\n      profit, and to enable our merchants to turn into a branch of trade, of\r\n      which the returns are more slow and distant than those of the greater part\r\n      of other trades, a greater proportion of their capital than they otherwise\r\n      would have done; two events which, if a bounty could have prevented, it\r\n      might perhaps have been very well worth while to give such a bounty.\r\n\r\n      Under the present system of management, therefore, Great Britain derives\r\n      nothing but loss from the dominion which she assumes over her colonies.\r\n\r\n      To propose that Great Britain should voluntarily give up all authority\r\n      over her colonies, and leave them to elect their own magistrates, to enact\r\n      their own laws, and to make peace and war, as they might think proper,\r\n      would be to propose such a measure as never was, and never will be,\r\n      adopted by any nation in the world. No nation ever voluntarily gave up the\r\n      dominion of any province, how troublesome soever it might be to govern it,\r\n      and how small soever the revenue which it afforded might be in proportion\r\n      to the expense which it occasioned. Such sacrifices, though they might\r\n      frequently be agreeable to the interest, are always mortifying to the\r\n      pride of every nation; and, what is perhaps of still greater consequence,\r\n      they are always contrary to the private interest of the governing part of\r\n      it, who would thereby be deprived of the disposal of many places of trust\r\n      and profit, of many opportunities of acquiring wealth and distinction,\r\n      which the possession of the most turbulent, and, to the great body of the\r\n      people, the most unprofitable province, seldom fails to afford. The most\r\n      visionary enthusiasts would scarce be capable of proposing such a measure,\r\n      with any serious hopes at least of its ever being adopted. If it was\r\n      adopted, however, Great Britain would not only be immediately freed from\r\n      the whole annual expense of the peace establishment of the colonies, but\r\n      might settle with them such a treaty of commerce as would effectually\r\n      secure to her a free trade, more advantageous to the great body of the\r\n      people, though less so to the merchants, than the monopoly which she at\r\n      present enjoys. By thus parting good friends, the natural affection of the\r\n      colonies to the mother country, which, perhaps, our late dissensions have\r\n      well nigh extinguished, would quickly revive. It might dispose them not\r\n      only to respect, for whole centuries together, that treaty of commerce\r\n      which they had concluded with us at parting, but to favour us in war as\r\n      well as in trade, and instead of turbulent and factious subjects, to\r\n      become our most faithful, affectionate, and generous allies; and the same\r\n      sort of parental affection on the one side, and filial respect on the\r\n      other, might revive between Great Britain and her colonies, which used to\r\n      subsist between those of ancient Greece and the mother city from which\r\n      they descended.\r\n\r\n      In order to render any province advantageous to the empire to which it\r\n      belongs, it ought to afford, in time of peace, a revenue to the public,\r\n      sufficient not only for defraying the whole expense of its own peace\r\n      establishment, but for contributing its proportion to the support of the\r\n      general government of the empire. Every province necessarily contributes,\r\n      more or less, to increase the expense of that general government. If any\r\n      particular province, therefore, does not contribute its share towards\r\n      defraying this expense, an unequal burden must be thrown upon some other\r\n      part of the empire. The extraordinary revenue, too, which every province\r\n      affords to the public in time of war, ought, from parity of reason, to\r\n      bear the same proportion to the extraordinary revenue of the whole empire,\r\n      which its ordinary revenue does in time of peace. That neither the\r\n      ordinary nor extraordinary revenue which Great Britain derives from her\r\n      colonies, bears this proportion to the whole revenue of the British\r\n      empire, will readily be allowed. The monopoly, it has been supposed,\r\n      indeed, by increasing the private revenue of the people of Great Britain,\r\n      and thereby enabling them to pay greater taxes, compensates the deficiency\r\n      of the public revenue of the colonies. But this monopoly, I have\r\n      endeavoured to show, though a very grievous tax upon the colonies, and\r\n      though it may increase the revenue of a particular order of men in Great\r\n      Britain, diminishes, instead of increasing, that of the great body of the\r\n      people, and consequently diminishes, instead of increasing, the ability of\r\n      the great body of the people to pay taxes. The men, too, whose revenue the\r\n      monopoly increases, constitute a particular order, which it is both\r\n      absolutely impossible to tax beyond the proportion of other orders, and\r\n      extremely impolitic even to attempt to tax beyond that proportion, as I\r\n      shall endeavour to show in the following book. No particular resource,\r\n      therefore, can be drawn from this particular order.\r\n\r\n      The colonies may be taxed either by their own assemblies, or by the\r\n      parliament of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      That the colony assemblies can never be so managed as to levy upon their\r\n      constituents a public revenue, sufficient, not only to maintain at all\r\n      times their own civil and military establishment, but to pay their proper\r\n      proportion of the expense of the general government of the British empire,\r\n      seems not very probable. It was a long time before even the parliament of\r\n      England, though placed immediately under the eye of the sovereign, could\r\n      be brought under such a system of management, or could be rendered\r\n      sufficiently liberal in their grants for supporting the civil and military\r\n      establishments even of their own country. It was only by distributing\r\n      among the particular members of parliament a great part either of the\r\n      offices, or of the disposal of the offices arising from this civil and\r\n      military establishment, that such a system of management could be\r\n      established, even with regard to the parliament of England. But the\r\n      distance of the colony assemblies from the eye of the sovereign, their\r\n      number, their dispersed situation, and their various constitutions, would\r\n      render it very difficult to manage them in the same manner, even though\r\n      the sovereign had the same means of doing it; and those means are wanting.\r\n      It would be absolutely impossible to distribute among all the leading\r\n      members of all the colony assemblies such a share, either of the offices,\r\n      or of the disposal of the offices, arising from the general government of\r\n      the British empire, as to dispose them to give up their popularity at\r\n      home, and to tax their constituents for the support of that general\r\n      government, of which almost the whole emoluments were to be divided among\r\n      people who were strangers to them. The unavoidable ignorance of\r\n      administration, besides, concerning the relative importance of the\r\n      different members of those different assemblies, the offences which must\r\n      frequently be given, the blunders which must constantly be committed, in\r\n      attempting to manage them in this manner, seems to render such a system of\r\n      management altogether impracticable with regard to them.\r\n\r\n      The colony assemblies, besides, cannot be supposed the proper judges of\r\n      what is necessary for the defence and support of the whole empire. The\r\n      care of that defence and support is not entrusted to them. It is not their\r\n      business, and they have no regular means of information concerning it. The\r\n      assembly of a province, like the vestry of a parish, may judge very\r\n      properly concerning the affairs of its own particular district, but can\r\n      have no proper means of judging concerning those of the whole empire. It\r\n      cannot even judge properly concerning the proportion which its own\r\n      province bears to the whole empire, or concerning the relative degree of\r\n      its wealth and importance, compared with the other provinces; because\r\n      those other provinces are not under the inspection and superintendency of\r\n      the assembly of a particular province. What is necessary for the defence\r\n      and support of the whole empire, and in what proportion each part ought to\r\n      contribute, can be judged of only by that assembly which inspects and\r\n      super-intends the affairs of the whole empire.\r\n\r\n      It has been proposed, accordingly, that the colonies should be taxed by\r\n      requisition, the parliament of Great Britain determining the sum which\r\n      each colony ought to pay, and the provincial assembly assessing and\r\n      levying it in the way that suited best the circumstances of the province.\r\n      What concerned the whole empire would in this way be determined by the\r\n      assembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire;\r\n      and the provincial affairs of each colony might still be regulated by its\r\n      own assembly. Though the colonies should, in this case, have no\r\n      representatives in the British parliament, yet, if we may judge by\r\n      experience, there is no probability that the parliamentary requisition\r\n      would be unreasonable. The parliament of England has not, upon any\r\n      occasion, shewn the smallest disposition to overburden those parts of the\r\n      empire which are not represented in parliament. The islands of Guernsey\r\n      and Jersey, without any means of resisting the authority of parliament,\r\n      are more lightly taxed than any part of Great Britain. Parliament, in\r\n      attempting to exercise its supposed right, whether well or ill grounded,\r\n      of taxing the colonies, has never hitherto demanded of them anything which\r\n      even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow\r\n      subjects at home. If the contribution of the colonies, besides, was to\r\n      rise or fall in proportion to the rise or fall of the land-tax, parliament\r\n      could not tax them without taxing, at the same time, its own constituents,\r\n      and the colonies might, in this case, be considered as virtually\r\n      represented in parliament.\r\n\r\n      Examples are not wanting of empires in which all the different provinces\r\n      are not taxed, if I may be allowed the expression, in one mass; but in\r\n      which the sovereign regulates the sum which each province ought to pay,\r\n      and in some provinces assesses and levies it as he thinks proper; while in\r\n      others he leaves it to be assessed and levied as the respective states of\r\n      each province shall determine. In some provinces of France, the king not\r\n      only imposes what taxes he thinks proper, but assesses and levies them in\r\n      the way he thinks proper. From others he demands a certain sum, but leaves\r\n      it to the states of each province to assess and levy that sum as they\r\n      think proper. According to the scheme of taxing by requisition, the\r\n      parliament of Great Britain would stand nearly in the same situation\r\n      towards the colony assemblies, as the king of France does towards the\r\n      states of those provinces which still enjoy the privilege of having states\r\n      of their own, the provinces of France which are supposed to be the best\r\n      governed.\r\n\r\n      But though, according to this scheme, the colonies could have no just\r\n      reason to fear that their share of the public burdens should ever exceed\r\n      the proper proportion to that of their fellow-citizens at home, Great\r\n      Britain might have just reason to fear that it never would amount to that\r\n      proper proportion. The parliament of Great Britain has not, for some time\r\n      past, had the same established authority in the colonies, which the French\r\n      king has in those provinces of France which still enjoy the privilege of\r\n      having states of their own. The colony assemblies, if they were not very\r\n      favourably disposed (and unless more skilfully managed than they ever have\r\n      been hitherto, they are not very likely to be so), might still find many\r\n      pretences for evading or rejecting the most reasonable requisitions of\r\n      parliament. A French war breaks out, we shall suppose; ten millions must\r\n      immediately be raised, in order to defend the seat of the empire. This sum\r\n      must be borrowed upon the credit of some parliamentary fund mortgaged for\r\n      paying the interest. Part of this fund parliament proposes to raise by a\r\n      tax to be levied in Great Britain; and part of it by a requisition to all\r\n      the different colony assemblies of America and the West Indies. Would\r\n      people readily advance their money upon the credit of a fund which partly\r\n      depended upon the good humour of all those assemblies, far distant from\r\n      the seat of the war, and sometimes, perhaps, thinking themselves not much\r\n      concerned in the event of it? Upon such a fund, no more money would\r\n      probably be advanced than what the tax to be levied in Great Britain might\r\n      be supposed to answer for. The whole burden of the debt contracted on\r\n      account of the war would in this manner fall, as it always has done\r\n      hitherto, upon Great Britain; upon a part of the empire, and not upon the\r\n      whole empire. Great Britain is, perhaps, since the world began, the only\r\n      state which, as it has extended its empire, has only increased its\r\n      expense, without once augmenting its resources. Other states have\r\n      generally disburdened themselves, upon their subject and subordinate\r\n      provinces, of the most considerable part of the expense of defending the\r\n      empire. Great Britain has hitherto suffered her subject and subordinate\r\n      provinces to disburden themselves upon her of almost this whole expense.\r\n      In order to put Great Britain upon a footing of equality with her own\r\n      colonies, which the law has hitherto supposed to be subject and\r\n      subordinate, it seems necessary, upon the scheme of taxing them by\r\n      parliamentary requisition, that parliament should have some means of\r\n      rendering its requisitions immediately effectual, in case the colony\r\n      assemblies should attempt to evade or reject them; and what those means\r\n      are, it is not very easy to conceive, and it has not yet been explained.\r\n\r\n      Should the parliament of Great Britain, at the same time, be ever fully\r\n      established in the right of taxing the colonies, even independent of the\r\n      consent of their own assemblies, the importance of those assemblies would,\r\n      from that moment, be at an end, and with it, that of all the leading men\r\n      of British America. Men desire to have some share in the management of\r\n      public affairs, chiefly on account of the importance which it gives them.\r\n      Upon the power which the greater part of the leading men, the natural\r\n      aristocracy of every country, have of preserving or defending their\r\n      respective importance, depends the stability and duration of every system\r\n      of free government. In the attacks which those leading men are continually\r\n      making upon the importance of one another, and in the defence of their\r\n      own, consists the whole play of domestic faction and ambition. The leading\r\n      men of America, like those of all other countries, desire to preserve\r\n      their own importance. They feel, or imagine, that if their assemblies,\r\n      which they are fond of calling parliaments, and of considering as equal in\r\n      authority to the parliament of Great Britain, should be so far degraded as\r\n      to become the humble ministers and executive officers of that parliament,\r\n      the greater part of their own importance would be at an end. They have\r\n      rejected, therefore, the proposal of being taxed by parliamentary\r\n      requisition, and, like other ambitious and high-spirited men, have rather\r\n      chosen to draw the sword in defence of their own importance.\r\n\r\n      Towards the declension of the Roman republic, the allies of Rome, who had\r\n      borne the principal burden of defending the state and extending the\r\n      empire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens.\r\n      Upon being refused, the social war broke out. During the course of that\r\n      war, Rome granted those privileges to the greater part of them, one by\r\n      one, and in proportion as they detached themselves from the general\r\n      confederacy. The parliament of Great Britain insists upon taxing the\r\n      colonies; and they refuse to be taxed by a parliament in which they are\r\n      not represented. If to each colony which should detach itself from the\r\n      general confederacy, Great Britain should allow such a number of\r\n      representatives as suited the proportion of what it contributed to the\r\n      public revenue of the empire, in consequence of its being subjected to the\r\n      same taxes, and in compensation admitted to the same freedom of trade with\r\n      its fellow-subjects at home; the number of its representatives to be\r\n      augmented as the proportion of its contribution might afterwards augment;\r\n      a new method of acquiring importance, a new and more dazzling object of\r\n      ambition, would be presented to the leading men of each colony. Instead of\r\n      piddling for the little prizes which are to be found in what may be called\r\n      the paltry raffle of colony faction, they might then hope, from the\r\n      presumption which men naturally have in their own ability and good\r\n      fortune, to draw some of the great prizes which sometimes come from the\r\n      wheel of the great state lottery of British politics. Unless this or some\r\n      other method is fallen upon, and there seems to be none more obvious than\r\n      this, of preserving the importance and of gratifying the ambition of the\r\n      leading men of America, it is not very probable that they will ever\r\n      voluntarily submit to us; and we ought to consider, that the blood which\r\n      must be shed in forcing them to do so, is, every drop of it, the blood\r\n      either of those who are, or of those whom we wish to have for our fellow\r\n      citizens. They are very weak who flatter themselves that, in the state to\r\n      which things have come, our colonies will be easily conquered by force\r\n      alone. The persons who now govern the resolutions of what they call their\r\n      continental congress, feel in themselves at this moment a degree of\r\n      importance which, perhaps, the greatest subjects in Europe scarce feel.\r\n      From shopkeepers, trades men, and attorneys, they are become statesmen and\r\n      legislators, and are employed in contriving a new form of government for\r\n      an extensive empire, which, they flatter themselves, will become, and\r\n      which, indeed, seems very likely to become, one of the greatest and most\r\n      formidable that ever was in the world. Five hundred different people,\r\n      perhaps, who, in different ways, act immediately under the continental\r\n      congress, and five hundred thousand, perhaps, who act under those five\r\n      hundred, all feel, in the same manner, a proportionable rise in their own\r\n      importance. Almost every individual of the governing party in America\r\n      fills, at present, in his own fancy, a station superior, not only to what\r\n      he had ever filled before, but to what he had ever expected to fill; and\r\n      unless some new object of ambition is presented either to him or to his\r\n      leaders, if he has the ordinary spirit of a man, he will die in defence of\r\n      that station.\r\n\r\n      It is a remark of the President Heynaut, that we now read with pleasure\r\n      the account of many little transactions of the Ligue, which, when they\r\n      happened, were not, perhaps, considered as very important pieces of news.\r\n      But everyman then, says he, fancied himself of some importance; and the\r\n      innumerable memoirs which have come down to us from those times, were the\r\n      greater part of them written by people who took pleasure in recording and\r\n      magnifying events, in which they flattered themselves they had been\r\n      considerable actors. How obstinately the city of Paris, upon that\r\n      occasion, defended itself, what a dreadful famine it supported, rather\r\n      than submit to the best, and afterwards the most beloved of all the French\r\n      kings, is well known. The greater part of the citizens, or those who\r\n      governed the greater part of them, fought in defence of their own\r\n      importance, which, they foresaw, was to be at an end whenever the ancient\r\n      government should be re-established. Our colonies, unless they can be\r\n      induced to consent to a union, are very likely to defend themselves,\r\n      against the best of all mother countries, as obstinately as the city of\r\n      Paris did against one of the best of kings.\r\n\r\n      The idea of representation was unknown in ancient times. When the people\r\n      of one state were admitted to the right of citizenship in another, they\r\n      had no other means of exercising that right, but by coming in a body to\r\n      vote and deliberate with the people of that other state. The admission of\r\n      the greater part of the inhabitants of Italy to the privileges of Roman\r\n      citizens, completely ruined the Roman republic. It was no longer possible\r\n      to distinguish between who was, and who was not, a Roman citizen. No tribe\r\n      could know its own members. A rabble of any kind could be introduced into\r\n      the assemblies of the people, could drive out the real citizens, and\r\n      decide upon the affairs of the republic, as if they themselves had been\r\n      such. But though America were to send fifty or sixty new representatives\r\n      to parliament, the door-keeper of the house of commons could not find any\r\n      great difficulty in distinguishing between who was and who was not a\r\n      member. Though the Roman constitution, therefore, was necessarily ruined\r\n      by the union of Rome with the allied states of Italy, there is not the\r\n      least probability that the British constitution would be hurt by the union\r\n      of Great Britain with her colonies. That constitution, on the contrary,\r\n      would be completed by it, and seems to be imperfect without it. The\r\n      assembly which deliberates and decides concerning the affairs of every\r\n      part of the empire, in order to be properly informed, ought certainly to\r\n      have representatives from every part of it. That this union, however,\r\n      could be easily effectuated, or that difficulties, and great difficulties,\r\n      might not occur in the execution, I do not pretend. I have yet heard of\r\n      none, however, which appear insurmountable. The principal, perhaps, arise,\r\n      not from the nature of things, but from the prejudices and opinions of the\r\n      people, both on this and on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n      We on this side the water are afraid lest the multitude of American\r\n      representatives should overturn the balance of the constitution, and\r\n      increase too much either the influence of the crown on the one hand, or\r\n      the force of the democracy on the other. But if the number of American\r\n      representatives were to be in proportion to the produce of American\r\n      taxation, the number of people to be managed would increase exactly in\r\n      proportion to the means of managing them, and the means of managing to the\r\n      number of people to be managed. The monarchical and democratical parts of\r\n      the constitution would, after the union, stand exactly in the same degree\r\n      of relative force with regard to one another as they had done before.\r\n\r\n      The people on the other side of the water are afraid lest their distance\r\n      from the seat of government might expose them to many oppressions; but\r\n      their representatives in parliament, of which the number ought from the\r\n      first to be considerable, would easily be able to protect them from all\r\n      oppression. The distance could not much weaken the dependency of the\r\n      representative upon the constituent, and the former would still feel that\r\n      he owed his seat in parliament, and all the consequence which he derived\r\n      from it, to the good-will of the latter. It would be the interest of the\r\n      former, therefore, to cultivate that good-will, by complaining, with all\r\n      the authority of a member of the legislature, of every outrage which any\r\n      civil or military officer might be guilty of in those remote parts of the\r\n      empire. The distance of America from the seat of government, besides, the\r\n      natives of that country might flatter themselves, with some appearance of\r\n      reason too, would not be of very long continuance. Such has hitherto been\r\n      the rapid progress of that country in wealth, population, and improvement,\r\n      that in the course of little more than a century, perhaps, the produce of\r\n      the American might exceed that of the British taxation. The seat of the\r\n      empire would then naturally remove itself to that part of the empire which\r\n      contributed most to the general defence and support of the whole.\r\n\r\n      The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the\r\n      Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events recorded\r\n      in the history of mankind. Their consequences have already been great;\r\n      but, in the short period of between two and three centuries which has\r\n      elapsed since these discoveries were made, it is impossible that the whole\r\n      extent of their consequences can have been seen. What benefits or what\r\n      misfortunes to mankind may hereafter result from those great events, no\r\n      human wisdom can foresee. By uniting in some measure the most distant\r\n      parts of the world, by enabling them to relieve one another’s wants, to\r\n      increase one another’s enjoyments, and to encourage one another’s\r\n      industry, their general tendency would seem to be beneficial. To the\r\n      natives, however, both of the East and West Indies, all the commercial\r\n      benefits which can have resulted from those events have been sunk and lost\r\n      in the dreadful misfortunes which they have occasioned. These misfortunes,\r\n      however, seem to have arisen rather from accident than from any thing in\r\n      the nature of those events themselves. At the particular time when these\r\n      discoveries were made, the superiority of force happened to be so great on\r\n      the side of the Europeans, that they were enabled to commit with impunity\r\n      every sort of injustice in those remote countries. Hereafter, perhaps, the\r\n      natives of those countries may grow stronger, or those of Europe may grow\r\n      weaker; and the inhabitants of all the different quarters of the world may\r\n      arrive at that equality of courage and force which, by inspiring mutual\r\n      fear, can alone overawe the injustice of independent nations into some\r\n      sort of respect for the rights of one another. But nothing seems more\r\n      likely to establish this equality of force, than that mutual communication\r\n      of knowledge, and of all sorts of improvements, which an extensive\r\n      commerce from all countries to all countries naturally, or rather\r\n      necessarily, carries along with it.\r\n\r\n      In the mean time, one of the principal effects of those discoveries has\r\n      been, to raise the mercantile system to a degree of splendour and glory\r\n      which it could never otherwise have attained to. It is the object of that\r\n      system to enrich a great nation, rather by trade and manufactures than by\r\n      the improvement and cultivation of land, rather by the industry of the\r\n      towns than by that of the country. But in consequence of those\r\n      discoveries, the commercial towns of Europe, instead of being the\r\n      manufacturers and carriers for but a very small part of the world (that\r\n      part of Europe which is washed by the Atlantic ocean, and the countries\r\n      which lie round the Baltic and Mediterranean seas), have now become the\r\n      manufacturers for the numerous and thriving cultivators of America, and\r\n      the carriers, and in some respects the manufacturers too, for almost all\r\n      the different nations of Asia, Africa, and America. Two new worlds have\r\n      been opened to their industry, each of them much greater and more\r\n      extensive than the old one, and the market of one of them growing still\r\n      greater and greater every day.\r\n\r\n      The countries which possess the colonies of America, and which trade\r\n      directly to the East Indies, enjoy indeed the whole show and splendour of\r\n      this great commerce. Other countries, however, notwithstanding all the\r\n      invidious restraints by which it is meant to exclude them, frequently\r\n      enjoy a greater share of the real benefit of it. The colonies of Spain and\r\n      Portugal, for example, give more real encouragement to the industry of\r\n      other countries than to that of Spain and Portugal. In the single article\r\n      of linen alone, the consumption of those colonies amounts, it is said (but\r\n      I do not pretend to warrant the quantity ), to more than three millions\r\n      sterling a-year. But this great consumption is almost entirely supplied by\r\n      France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Spain and Portugal furnish but a\r\n      small part of it. The capital which supplies the colonies with this great\r\n      quantity of linen, is annually distributed among, and furnishes a revenue\r\n      to, the inhabitants of those other countries. The profits of it only are\r\n      spent in Spain and Portugal, where they help to support the sumptuous\r\n      profusion of the merchants of Cadiz and Lisbon.\r\n\r\n      Even the regulations by which each nation endeavours to secure to itself\r\n      the exclusive trade of its own colonies, are frequently more hurtful to\r\n      the countries in favour of which they are established, than to those\r\n      against which they are established. The unjust oppression of the industry\r\n      of other countries falls back, if I may say so, upon the heads of the\r\n      oppressors, and crushes their industry more than it does that of those\r\n      other countries. By those regulations, for example, the merchant of\r\n      Hamburg must send the linen which he destines for the American market to\r\n      London, and he must bring back from thence the tobacco which he destines\r\n      for the German market; because he can neither send the one directly to\r\n      America, nor bring the other directly from thence. By this restraint he is\r\n      probably obliged to sell the one somewhat cheaper, and to buy the other\r\n      somewhat dearer, than he otherwise might have done; and his profits are\r\n      probably somewhat abridged by means of it. In this trade, however, between\r\n      Hamburg and London, he certainly receives the returns of his capital much\r\n      more quickly than he could possibly have done in the direct trade to\r\n      America, even though we should suppose, what is by no means the case, that\r\n      the payments of America were as punctual as those of London. In the trade,\r\n      therefore, to which those regulations confine the merchant of Hamburg, his\r\n      capital can keep in constant employment a much greater quantity of German\r\n      industry than he possibly could have done in the trade from which he is\r\n      excluded. Though the one employment, therefore, may to him perhaps be less\r\n      profitable than the other, it cannot be less advantageous to his country.\r\n      It is quite otherwise with the employment into which the monopoly\r\n      naturally attracts, if I may say so, the capital of the London merchant.\r\n      That employment may, perhaps, be more profitable to him than the greater\r\n      part of other employments; but on account of the slowness of the returns,\r\n      it cannot be more advantageous to his country.\r\n\r\n      After all the unjust attempts, therefore, of every country in Europe to\r\n      engross to itself the whole advantage of the trade of its own colonies, no\r\n      country has yet been able to engross to itself any thing but the expense\r\n      of supporting in time of peace, and of defending in time of war, the\r\n      oppressive authority which it assumes over them. The inconveniencies\r\n      resulting from the possession of its colonies, every country has engrossed\r\n      to itself completely. The advantages resulting from their trade, it has\r\n      been obliged to share with many other countries.\r\n\r\n      At first sight, no doubt, the monopoly of the great commerce of America\r\n      naturally seems to be an acquisition of the highest value. To the\r\n      undiscerning eye of giddy ambition it naturally presents itself, amidst\r\n      the confused scramble of politics and war, as a very dazzling object to\r\n      fight for. The dazzling splendour of the object, however, the immense\r\n      greatness of the commerce, is the very quality which renders the monopoly\r\n      of it hurtful, or which makes one employment, in its own nature\r\n      necessarily less advantageous to the country than the greater part of\r\n      other employments, absorb a much greater proportion of the capital of the\r\n      country than what would otherwise have gone to it.\r\n\r\n      The mercantile stock of every country, it has been shown in the second\r\n      book, naturally seeks, if one may say so, the employment most advantageous\r\n      to that country. If it is employed in the carrying trade, the country to\r\n      which it belongs becomes the emporium of the goods of all the countries\r\n      whose trade that stock carries on. But the owner of that stock necessarily\r\n      wishes to dispose of as great a part of those goods as he can at home. He\r\n      thereby saves himself the trouble, risk, and expense of exportation; and\r\n      he will upon that account be glad to sell them at home, not only for a\r\n      much smaller price, but with somewhat a smaller profit, than he might\r\n      expect to make by sending them abroad. He naturally, therefore, endeavours\r\n      as much as he can to turn his carrying trade into a foreign trade of\r\n      consumption, If his stock, again, is employed in a foreign trade of\r\n      consumption, he will, for the same reason, be glad to dispose of, at home,\r\n      as great a part as he can of the home goods which he collects in order to\r\n      export to some foreign market, and he will thus endeavour, as much as he\r\n      can, to turn his foreign trade of consumption into a home trade. The\r\n      mercantile stock of every country naturally courts in this manner the\r\n      near, and shuns the distant employment: naturally courts the employment in\r\n      which the returns are frequent, and shuns that in which they are distant\r\n      and slow; naturally courts the employment in which it can maintain the\r\n      greatest quantity of productive labour in the country to which it belongs,\r\n      or in which its owner resides, and shuns that in which it can maintain\r\n      there the smallest quantity. It naturally courts the employment which in\r\n      ordinary cases is most advantageous, and shuns that which in ordinary\r\n      cases is least advantageous to that country.\r\n\r\n      But if, in any one of those distant employments, which in ordinary cases\r\n      are less advantageous to the country, the profit should happen to rise\r\n      somewhat higher than what is sufficient to balance the natural preference\r\n      which is given to nearer employments, this superiority of profit will draw\r\n      stock from those nearer employments, till the profits of all return to\r\n      their proper level. This superiority of profit, however, is a proof that,\r\n      in the actual circumstances of the society, those distant employments are\r\n      somewhat understocked in proportion to other employments, and that the\r\n      stock of the society is not distributed in the properest manner among all\r\n      the different employments carried on in it. It is a proof that something\r\n      is either bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be, and that some\r\n      particular class of citizens is more or less oppressed, either by paying\r\n      more, or by getting less than what is suitable to that equality which\r\n      ought to take place, and which naturally does take place, among all the\r\n      different classes of them. Though the same capital never will maintain the\r\n      same quantity of productive labour in a distant as in a near employment,\r\n      yet a distant employment maybe as necessary for the welfare of the society\r\n      as a near one; the goods which the distant employment deals in being\r\n      necessary, perhaps, for carrying on many of the nearer employments. But if\r\n      the profits of those who deal in such goods are above their proper level,\r\n      those goods will be sold dearer than they ought to be, or somewhat above\r\n      their natural price, and all those engaged in the nearer employments will\r\n      be more or less oppressed by this high price. Their interest, therefore,\r\n      in this case, requires, that some stock should be withdrawn from those\r\n      nearer employments, and turned towards that distant one, in order to\r\n      reduce its profits to their proper level, and the price of the goods which\r\n      it deals in to their natural price. In this extraordinary case, the public\r\n      interest requires that some stock should be withdrawn from those\r\n      employments which, in ordinary cases, are more advantageous, and turned\r\n      towards one which, in ordinary cases, is less advantageous to the public;\r\n      and, in this extraordinary case, the natural interests and inclinations of\r\n      men coincide as exactly with the public interests as in all other ordinary\r\n      cases, and lead them to withdraw stock from the near, and to turn it\r\n      towards the distant employments.\r\n\r\n      It is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals\r\n      naturally dispose them to turn their stock towards the employments which\r\n      in ordinary cases, are most advantageous to the society. But if from this\r\n      natural preference they should turn too much of it towards those\r\n      employments, the fall of profit in them, and the rise of it in all others,\r\n      immediately dispose them to alter this faulty distribution. Without any\r\n      intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men\r\n      naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society\r\n      among all the different employments carried on in it; as nearly as\r\n      possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the\r\n      whole society.\r\n\r\n      All the different regulations of the mercantile system necessarily derange\r\n      more or less this natural and most advantageous distribution of stock. But\r\n      those which concern the trade to America and the East Indies derange it,\r\n      perhaps, more than any other; because the trade to those two great\r\n      continents absorbs a greater quantity of stock than any two other branches\r\n      of trade. The regulations, however, by which this derangement is effected\r\n      in those two different branches of trade, are not altogether the same.\r\n      Monopoly is the great engine of both; but it is a different sort of\r\n      monopoly. Monopoly of one kind or another, indeed, seems to be the sole\r\n      engine of the mercantile system.\r\n\r\n      In the trade to America, every nation endeavours to engross as much as\r\n      possible the whole market of its own colonies, by fairly excluding all\r\n      other nations from any direct trade to them. During the greater part of\r\n      the sixteenth century, the Portuguese endeavoured to manage the trade to\r\n      the East Indies in the same manner, by claiming the sole right of sailing\r\n      in the Indian seas, on account of the merit of having first found out the\r\n      road to them. The Dutch still continue to exclude all other European\r\n      nations from any direct trade to their spice islands. Monopolies of this\r\n      kind are evidently established against all other European nations, who are\r\n      thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient for\r\n      them to turn some part of their stock, but are obliged to buy the goods\r\n      which that trade deals in, somewhat dearer than if they could import them\r\n      themselves directly from the countries which produced them.\r\n\r\n      But since the fall of the power of Portugal, no European nation has\r\n      claimed the exclusive right of sailing in the Indian seas, of which the\r\n      principal ports are now open to the ships of all European nations. Except\r\n      in Portugal, however, and within these few years in France, the trade to\r\n      the East Indies has, in every European country, been subjected to an\r\n      exclusive company. Monopolies of this kind are properly established\r\n      against the very nation which erects them. The greater part of that nation\r\n      are thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient\r\n      for them to turn some part of their stock, but are obliged to buy the\r\n      goods which that trade deals in somewhat dearer than if it was open and\r\n      free to all their countrymen. Since the establishment of the English East\r\n      India company, for example, the other inhabitants of England, over and\r\n      above being excluded from the trade, must have paid, in the price of the\r\n      East India goods which they have consumed, not only for all the\r\n      extraordinary profits which the company may have made upon those goods in\r\n      consequence of their monopoly, but for all the extraordinary waste which\r\n      the fraud and abuse inseparable from the management of the affairs of so\r\n      great a company must necessarily have occasioned. The absurdity of this\r\n      second kind of monopoly, therefore, is much more manifest than that of the\r\n      first.\r\n\r\n      Both these kinds of monopolies derange more or less the natural\r\n      distribution of the stock of the society; but they do not always derange\r\n      it in the same way.\r\n\r\n      Monopolies of the first kind always attract to the particular trade in\r\n      which they are established a greater proportion of the stock of the\r\n      society than what would go to that trade of its own accord.\r\n\r\n      Monopolies of the second kind may sometimes attract stock towards the\r\n      particular trade in which they are established, and sometimes repel it\r\n      from that trade, according to different circumstances. In poor countries,\r\n      they naturally attract towards that trade more stock than would otherwise\r\n      go to it. In rich countries, they naturally repel from it a good deal of\r\n      stock which would otherwise go to it.\r\n\r\n      Such poor countries as Sweden and Denmark, for example, would probably\r\n      have never sent a single ship to the East Indies, had not the trade been\r\n      subjected to an exclusive company. The establishment of such a company\r\n      necessarily encourages adventurers. Their monopoly secures them against\r\n      all competitors in the home market, and they have the same chance for\r\n      foreign markets with the traders of other nations. Their monopoly shows\r\n      them the certainty of a great profit upon a considerable quantity of\r\n      goods, and the chance of a considerable profit upon a great quantity.\r\n      Without such extraordinary encouragement, the poor traders of such poor\r\n      countries would probably never have thought of hazarding their small\r\n      capitals in so very distant and uncertain an adventure as the trade to the\r\n      East Indies must naturally have appeared to them.\r\n\r\n      Such a rich country as Holland, on the contrary, would probably, in the\r\n      case of a free trade, send many more ships to the East Indies than it\r\n      actually does. The limited stock of the Dutch East India company probably\r\n      repels from that trade many great mercantile capitals which would\r\n      otherwise go to it. The mercantile capital of Holland is so great, that it\r\n      is, as it were, continually overflowing, sometimes into the public funds\r\n      of foreign countries, sometimes into loans to private traders and\r\n      adventurers of foreign countries, sometimes into the most round-about\r\n      foreign trades of consumption, and sometimes into the carrying trade. All\r\n      near employments being completely filled up, all the capital which can be\r\n      placed in them with any tolerable profit being already placed in them, the\r\n      capital of Holland necessarily flows towards the most distant employments.\r\n      The trade to the East Indies, if it were altogether free, would probably\r\n      absorb the greater part of this redundant capital. The East Indies offer a\r\n      market both for the manufactures of Europe, and for the gold and silver,\r\n      as well as for the several other productions of America, greater and more\r\n      extensive than both Europe and America put together.\r\n\r\n      Every derangement of the natural distribution of stock is necessarily\r\n      hurtful to the society in which it takes place; whether it be by repelling\r\n      from a particular trade the stock which would otherwise go to it, or by\r\n      attracting towards a particular trade that which would not otherwise come\r\n      to it. If, without any exclusive company, the trade of Holland to the East\r\n      Indies would be greater than it actually is, that country must suffer a\r\n      considerable loss, by part of its capital being excluded from the\r\n      employment most convenient for that port. And, in the same manner, if,\r\n      without an exclusive company, the trade of Sweden and Denmark to the East\r\n      Indies would be less than it actually is, or, what perhaps is more\r\n      probable, would not exist at all, those two countries must likewise suffer\r\n      a considerable loss, by part of their capital being drawn into an\r\n      employment which must be more or less unsuitable to their present\r\n      circumstances. Better for them, perhaps, in the present circumstances, to\r\n      buy East India goods of other nations, even though they should pay\r\n      somewhat dearer, than to turn so great a part of their small capital to so\r\n      very distant a trade, in which the returns are so very slow, in which that\r\n      capital can maintain so small a quantity of productive labour at home,\r\n      where productive labour is so much wanted, where so little is done, and\r\n      where so much is to do.\r\n\r\n      Though without an exclusive company, therefore, a particular country\r\n      should not be able to carry on any direct trade to the East Indies, it\r\n      will not from thence follow, that such a company ought to be established\r\n      there, but only that such a country ought not, in these circumstances, to\r\n      trade directly to the East Indies. That such companies are not in general\r\n      necessary for carrying on the East India trade, is sufficiently\r\n      demonstrated by the experience of the Portuguese, who enjoyed almost the\r\n      whole of it for more than a century together, without any exclusive\r\n      company.\r\n\r\n      No private merchant, it has been said, could well have capital sufficient\r\n      to maintain factors and agents in the different ports of the East Indies,\r\n      in order to provide goods for the ships which he might occasionally send\r\n      thither; and yet, unless he was able to do this, the difficulty of finding\r\n      a cargo might frequently make his ships lose the season for returning; and\r\n      the expense of so long a delay would not only eat up the whole profit of\r\n      the adventure, but frequently occasion a very considerable loss. This\r\n      argument, however, if it proved any thing at all, would prove that no one\r\n      great branch of trade could be carried on without an exclusive company,\r\n      which is contrary to the experience of all nations. There is no great\r\n      branch of trade, in which the capital of any one private merchant is\r\n      sufficient for carrying on all the subordinate branches which must be\r\n      carried on, in order to carry on the principal one. But when a nation is\r\n      ripe for any great branch of trade, some merchants naturally turn their\r\n      capitals towards the principal, and some towards the subordinate branches\r\n      of it; and though all the different branches of it are in this manner\r\n      carried on, yet it very seldom happens that they are all carried on by the\r\n      capital of one private merchant. If a nation, therefore, is ripe for the\r\n      East India trade, a certain portion of its capital will naturally divide\r\n      itself among all the different branches of that trade. Some of its\r\n      merchants will find it for their interest to reside in the East Indies,\r\n      and to employ their capitals there in providing goods for the ships which\r\n      are to be sent out by other merchants who reside in Europe. The\r\n      settlements which different European nations have obtained in the East\r\n      Indies, if they were taken from the exclusive companies to which they at\r\n      present belong, and put under the immediate protection of the sovereign,\r\n      would render this residence both safe and easy, at least to the merchants\r\n      of the particular nations to whom those settlements belong. If, at any\r\n      particular time, that part of the capital of any country which of its own\r\n      accord tended and inclined, if I may say so, towards the East India trade,\r\n      was not sufficient for carrying on all those different branches of it, it\r\n      would be a proof that, at that particular time, that country was not ripe\r\n      for that trade, and that it would do better to buy for some time, even at\r\n      a higher price, from other European nations, the East India goods it had\r\n      occasion for, than to import them itself directly from the East Indies.\r\n      What it might lose by the high price of those goods, could seldom be equal\r\n      to the loss which it would sustain by the distraction of a large portion\r\n      of its capital from other employments more necessary, or more useful, or\r\n      more suitable to its circumstances and situation, than a direct trade to\r\n      the East Indies.\r\n\r\n      Though the Europeans possess many considerable settlements both upon the\r\n      coast of Africa and in the East Indies, they have not yet established, in\r\n      either of those countries, such numerous and thriving colonies as those in\r\n      the islands and continent of America. Africa, however, as well as several\r\n      of the countries comprehended under the general name of the East Indies,\r\n      is inhabited by barbarous nations. But those nations were by no means so\r\n      weak and defenceless as the miserable and helpless Americans; and in\r\n      proportion to the natural fertility of the countries which they inhabited,\r\n      they were, besides, much more populous. The most barbarous nations either\r\n      of Africa or of the East Indies, were shepherds; even the Hottentots were\r\n      so. But the natives of every part of America, except Mexico and Peru, were\r\n      only hunters and the difference is very great between the number of\r\n      shepherds and that of hunters whom the same extent of equally fertile\r\n      territory can maintain. In Africa and the East Indies, therefore, it was\r\n      more difficult to displace the natives, and to extend the European\r\n      plantations over the greater part of the lands of the original\r\n      inhabitants. The genius of exclusive companies, besides, is unfavourable,\r\n      it has already been observed, to the growth of new colonies, and has\r\n      probably been the principal cause of the little progress which they have\r\n      made in the East Indies. The Portuguese carried on the trade both to\r\n      Africa and the East Indies, without any exclusive companies; and their\r\n      settlements at Congo, Angola, and Benguela, on the coast of Africa, and at\r\n      Goa in the East Indies though much depressed by superstition and every\r\n      sort of bad government, yet bear some resemblance to the colonies of\r\n      America, and are partly inhabited by Portuguese who have been established\r\n      there for several generations. The Dutch settlements at the Cape of Good\r\n      Hope and at Batavia, are at present the most considerable colonies which\r\n      the Europeans have established, either in Africa or in the East Indies;\r\n      and both those settlements are peculiarly fortunate in their situation. The\r\n      Cape of Good Hope was inhabited by a race of people almost as barbarous,\r\n      and quite as incapable of defending themselves, as the natives of America.\r\n      It is, besides, the half-way house, if one may say so, between Europe and\r\n      the East Indies, at which almost every European ship makes some stay, both\r\n      in going and returning. The supplying of those ships with every sort of\r\n      fresh provisions, with fruit, and sometimes with wine, affords alone a\r\n      very extensive market for the surplus produce of the colonies. What the\r\n      Cape of Good Hope is between Europe and every part of the East Indies,\r\n      Batavia is between the principal countries of the East Indies. It lies\r\n      upon the most frequented road from Indostan to China and Japan, and is\r\n      nearly about mid-way upon that road. Almost all the ships too, that sail\r\n      between Europe and China, touch at Batavia; and it is, over and above all\r\n      this, the centre and principal mart of what is called the country trade of\r\n      the East Indies; not only of that part of it which is carried on by\r\n      Europeans, but of that which is carried on by the native Indians; and\r\n      vessels navigated by the inhabitants of China and Japan, of Tonquin,\r\n      Malacca, Cochin-China, and the island of Celebes, are frequently to be\r\n      seen in its port. Such advantageous situations have enabled those two\r\n      colonies to surmount all the obstacles which the oppressive genius of an\r\n      exclusive company may have occasionally opposed to their growth. They have\r\n      enabled Batavia to surmount the additional disadvantage of perhaps the\r\n      most unwholesome climate in the world.\r\n\r\n      The English and Dutch companies, though they have established no\r\n      considerable colonies, except the two above mentioned, have both made\r\n      considerable conquests in the East Indies. But in the manner in which they\r\n      both govern their new subjects, the natural genius of an exclusive company\r\n      has shewn itself most distinctly. In the spice islands, the Dutch are said\r\n      to burn all the spiceries which a fertile season produces, beyond what\r\n      they expect to dispose of in Europe with such a profit as they think\r\n      sufficient. In the islands where they have no settlements, they give a\r\n      premium to those who collect the young blossoms and green leaves of the\r\n      clove and nutmeg trees, which naturally grow there, but which this savage\r\n      policy has now, it is said, almost completely extirpated. Even in the\r\n      islands where they have settlements, they have very much reduced, it is\r\n      said, the number of those trees. If the produce even of their own islands\r\n      was much greater than what suited their market, the natives, they suspect,\r\n      might find means to convey some part of it to other nations; and the best\r\n      way, they imagine, to secure their own monopoly, is to take care that no\r\n      more shall grow than what they themselves carry to market. By different\r\n      arts of oppression, they have reduced the population of several of the\r\n      Moluccas nearly to the number which is sufficient to supply with fresh\r\n      provisions, and other necessaries of life, their own insignificant\r\n      garrisons, and such of their ships as occasionally come there for a cargo\r\n      of spices. Under the government even of the Portuguese, however, those\r\n      islands are said to have been tolerably well inhabited. The English\r\n      company have not yet had time to establish in Bengal so perfectly\r\n      destructive a system. The plan of their government, however, has had\r\n      exactly the same tendency. It has not been uncommon, I am well assured,\r\n      for the chief, that is, the first clerk or a factory, to order a peasant\r\n      to plough up a rich field of poppies, and sow it with rice, or some other\r\n      grain. The pretence was, to prevent a scarcity of provisions; but the real\r\n      reason, to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a better price a\r\n      large quantity of opium which he happened then to have upon hand. Upon\r\n      other occasions, the order has been reversed; and a rich field of rice or\r\n      other grain has been ploughed up, in order to make room for a plantation\r\n      of poppies, when the chief foresaw that extraordinary profit was likely to\r\n      be made by opium. The servants of the company have, upon several\r\n      occasions, attempted to establish in their own favour the monopoly of some\r\n      of the most important branches, not only of the foreign, but of the inland\r\n      trade of the country. Had they been allowed to go on, it is impossible\r\n      that they should not, at some time or another, have attempted to restrain\r\n      the production of the particular articles of which they had thus usurped\r\n      the monopoly, not only to the quantity which they themselves could\r\n      purchase, but to that which they could expect to sell with such a profit\r\n      as they might think sufficient. In the course of a century or two, the\r\n      policy of the English company would, in this manner, have probably proved\r\n      as completely destructive as that of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n      Nothing, however, can be more directly contrary to the real interest of\r\n      those companies, considered as the sovereigns of the countries which they\r\n      have conquered, than this destructive plan. In almost all countries, the\r\n      revenue of the sovereign is drawn from that of the people. The greater the\r\n      revenue of the people, therefore, the greater the annual produce of their\r\n      land and labour, the more they can afford to the sovereign. It is his\r\n      interest, therefore, to increase as much as possible that annual produce.\r\n      But if this is the interest of every sovereign, it is peculiarly so of one\r\n      whose revenue, like that of the sovereign of Bengal, arises chiefly from a\r\n      land-rent. That rent must necessarily be in proportion to the quantity and\r\n      value of the produce; and both the one and the other must depend upon the\r\n      extent of the market. The quantity will always be suited, with more or\r\n      less exactness, to the consumption of those who can afford to pay for it;\r\n      and the price which they will pay will always be in proportion to the\r\n      eagerness of their competition. It is the interest of such a sovereign,\r\n      therefore, to open the most extensive market for the produce of his\r\n      country, to allow the most perfect freedom of commerce, in order to\r\n      increase as much as possible the number and competition of buyers; and\r\n      upon this account to abolish, not only all monopolies, but all restraints\r\n      upon the transportation of the home produce from one part of the country\r\n      to another, upon its exportation to foreign countries, or upon the\r\n      importation of goods of any kind for which it can be exchanged. He is in\r\n      this manner most likely to increase both the quantity and value of that\r\n      produce, and consequently of his own share of it, or of his own revenue.\r\n\r\n      But a company of merchants, are, it seems, incapable of considering\r\n      themselves as sovereigns, even after they have become such. Trade, or\r\n      buying in order to sell again, they still consider as their principal\r\n      business, and by a strange absurdity, regard the character of the\r\n      sovereign as but an appendix to that of the merchant; as something which\r\n      ought to be made subservient to it, or by means of which they may be\r\n      enabled to buy cheaper in India, and thereby to sell with a better profit\r\n      in Europe. They endeavour, for this purpose, to keep out as much as\r\n      possible all competitors from the market of the countries which are\r\n      subject to their government, and consequently to reduce, at least, some\r\n      part of the surplus produce of those countries to what is barely\r\n      sufficient for supplying their own demand, or to what they can expect to\r\n      sell in Europe, with such a profit as they may think reasonable. Their\r\n      mercantile habits draw them in this manner, almost necessarily, though\r\n      perhaps insensibly, to prefer, upon all ordinary occasions, the little and\r\n      transitory profit of the monopolist to the great and permanent revenue of\r\n      the sovereign; and would gradually lead them to treat the countries\r\n      subject to their government nearly as the Dutch treat the Moluccas. It is\r\n      the interest of the East India company, considered as sovereigns, that the\r\n      European goods which are carried to their Indian dominions should be sold\r\n      there as cheap as possible; and that the Indian goods which are brought\r\n      from thence should bring there as good a price, or should be sold there as\r\n      dear as possible. But the reverse of this is their interest as merchants.\r\n      As sovereigns, their interest is exactly the same with that of the country\r\n      which they govern. As merchants, their interest is directly opposite to\r\n      that interest.\r\n\r\n      But if the genius of such a government, even as to what concerns its\r\n      direction in Europe, is in this manner essentially, and perhaps incurably\r\n      faulty, that of its administration in India is still more so. That\r\n      administration is necessarily composed of a council of merchants, a\r\n      profession no doubt extremely respectable, but which in no country in the\r\n      world carries along with it that sort of authority which naturally\r\n      overawes the people, and without force commands their willing obedience.\r\n      Such a council can command obedience only by the military force with which\r\n      they are accompanied; and their government is, therefore, necessarily\r\n      military and despotical. Their proper business, however, is that of\r\n      merchants. It is to sell, upon their master’s account, the European goods\r\n      consigned to them, and to buy, in return, Indian goods for the European\r\n      market. It is to sell the one as dear, and to buy the other as cheap as\r\n      possible, and consequently to exclude, as much as possible, all rivals\r\n      from the particular market where they keep their shop. The genius of the\r\n      administration, therefore, so far as concerns the trade of the company, is\r\n      the same as that of the direction. It tends to make government subservient\r\n      to the interest of monopoly, and consequently to stunt the natural growth\r\n      of some parts, at least, of the surplus produce of the country, to what is\r\n      barely sufficient for answering the demand of the company.\r\n\r\n      All the members of the administration besides, trade more or less upon\r\n      their own account; and it is in vain to prohibit them from doing so.\r\n      Nothing can be more completely foolish than to expect that the clerk of a\r\n      great counting-house, at ten thousand miles distance, and consequently\r\n      almost quite out of sight, should, upon a simple order from their master,\r\n      give up at once doing any sort of business upon their own account abandon\r\n      for ever all hopes of making a fortune, of which they have the means in\r\n      their hands; and content themselves with the moderate salaries which those\r\n      masters allow them, and which, moderate as they are, can seldom be\r\n      augmented, being commonly as large as the real profits of the company\r\n      trade can afford. In such circumstances, to prohibit the servants of the\r\n      company from trading upon their own account, can have scarce any other\r\n      effect than to enable its superior servants, under pretence of executing\r\n      their master’s order, to oppress such of the inferior ones as have had the\r\n      misfortune to fall under their displeasure. The servants naturally\r\n      endeavour to establish the same monopoly in favour of their own private\r\n      trade as of the public trade of the company. If they are suffered to act\r\n      as they could wish, they will establish this monopoly openly and directly,\r\n      by fairly prohibiting all other people from trading in the articles in\r\n      which they choose to deal; and this, perhaps, is the best and least\r\n      oppressive way of establishing it. But if, by an order from Europe, they\r\n      are prohibited from doing this, they will, notwithstanding, endeavour to\r\n      establish a monopoly of the same kind secretly and indirectly, in a way\r\n      that is much more destructive to the country. They will employ the whole\r\n      authority of government, and pervert the administration of Justice, in\r\n      order to harass and ruin those who interfere with them in any branch of\r\n      commerce, which by means of agents, either concealed, or at least not\r\n      publicly avowed, they may choose to carry on. But the private trade of the\r\n      servants will naturally extend to a much greater variety of articles than\r\n      the public trade of the company. The public trade of the company extends\r\n      no further than the trade with Europe, and comprehends a part only of the\r\n      foreign trade of the country. But the private trade of the servants may\r\n      extend to all the different branches both of its inland and foreign trade.\r\n      The monopoly of the company can tend only to stunt the natural growth of\r\n      that part of the surplus produce which, in the case of a free trade, would\r\n      be exported to Europe. That of the servants tends to stunt the natural\r\n      growth of every part of the produce in which they choose to deal; of what\r\n      is destined for home consumption, as well as of what is destined for\r\n      exportation; and consequently to degrade the cultivation of the whole\r\n      country, and to reduce the number of its inhabitants. It tends to reduce\r\n      the quantity of every sort of produce, even that of the necessaries of\r\n      life, whenever the servants of the country choose to deal in them, to what\r\n      those servants can both afford to buy and expect to sell with such a\r\n      profit as pleases them.\r\n\r\n      From the nature of their situation, too, the servants must be more\r\n      disposed to support with rigourous severity their own interest, against\r\n      that of the country which they govern, than their masters can be to\r\n      support theirs. The country belongs to their masters, who cannot avoid\r\n      having some regard for the interest of what belongs to them; but it does\r\n      not belong to the servants. The real interest of their masters, if they\r\n      were capable of understanding it, is the same with that of the country;\r\n      {The interest of every proprietor of India stock, however, is by no means\r\n      the same with that of the country in the government of which his vote\r\n      gives him some influence.—See book v, chap. 1, part ii.}and it is\r\n      from ignorance chiefly, and the meanness of mercantile prejudice, that\r\n      they ever oppress it. But the real interest of the servants is by no means\r\n      the same with that of the country, and the most perfect information would\r\n      not necessarily put an end to their oppressions. The regulations,\r\n      accordingly, which have been sent out from Europe, though they have been\r\n      frequently weak, have upon most occasions been well meaning. More\r\n      intelligence, and perhaps less good meaning, has sometimes appeared in\r\n      those established by the servants in India. It is a very singular\r\n      government in which every member of the administration wishes to get out\r\n      of the country, and consequently to have done with the government, as soon\r\n      as he can, and to whose interest, the day after he has left it, and\r\n      carried his whole fortune with him, it is perfectly indifferent though the\r\n      whole country was swallowed up by an earthquake.\r\n\r\n      I mean not, however, by any thing which I have here said, to throw any\r\n      odious imputation upon the general character of the servants of the East\r\n      India company, and touch less upon that of any particular persons. It is\r\n      the system of government, the situation in which they are placed, that I\r\n      mean to censure, not the character of those who have acted in it. They\r\n      acted as their situation naturally directed, and they who have clamoured\r\n      the loudest against them would probably not have acted better themselves.\r\n      In war and negotiation, the councils of Madras and Calcutta, have upon\r\n      several occasions, conducted themselves with a resolution and decisive\r\n      wisdom, which would have done honour to the senate of Rome in the best\r\n      days of that republic. The members of those councils, however, had been\r\n      bred to professions very different from war and politics. But their\r\n      situation alone, without education, experience, or even example, seems to\r\n      have formed in them all at once the great qualities which it required, and\r\n      to have inspired them both with abilities and virtues which they\r\n      themselves could not well know that they possessed. If upon some\r\n      occasions, therefore, it has animated them to actions of magnanimity which\r\n      could not well have been expected from them, we should not wonder if, upon\r\n      others, it has prompted them to exploits of somewhat a different nature.\r\n\r\n      Such exclusive companies, therefore, are nuisances in every respect;\r\n      always more or less inconvenient to the countries in which they are\r\n      established, and destructive to those which have the misfortune to fall\r\n      under their government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nCONCLUSION OF THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Though the encouragement of exportation, and the discouragement of\r\n      importation, are the two great engines by which the mercantile system\r\n      proposes to enrich every country, yet, with regard to some particular\r\n      commodities, it seems to follow an opposite plan: to discourage\r\n      exportation, and to encourage importation. Its ultimate object, however,\r\n      it pretends, is always the same, to enrich the country by an advantageous\r\n      balance of trade. It discourages the exportation of the materials of\r\n      manufacture, and of the instruments of trade, in order to give our own\r\n      workmen an advantage, and to enable them to undersell those of other\r\n      nations in all foreign markets; and by restraining, in this manner, the\r\n      exportation of a few commodities, of no great price, it proposes to\r\n      occasion a much greater and more valuable exportation of others. It\r\n      encourages the importation of the materials of manufacture, in order that\r\n      our own people may be enabled to work them up more cheaply, and thereby\r\n      prevent a greater and more valuable importation of the manufactured\r\n      commodities. I do not observe, at least in our statute book, any\r\n      encouragement given to the importation of the instruments of trade. When\r\n      manufactures have advanced to a certain pitch of greatness, the\r\n      fabrication of the instruments of trade becomes itself the object of a\r\n      great number of very important manufactures. To give any particular\r\n      encouragement to the importation of such instruments, would interfere too\r\n      much with the interest of those manufactures. Such importation, therefore,\r\n      instead of being encouraged, has frequently been prohibited. Thus the\r\n      importation of wool cards, except from Ireland, or when brought in as\r\n      wreck or prize goods, was prohibited by the 3rd of Edward IV.; which\r\n      prohibition was renewed by the 39th of Elizabeth, and has been continued\r\n      and rendered perpetual by subsequent laws.\r\n\r\n      The importation of the materials of manufacture has sometimes been\r\n      encouraged by an exemption from the duties to which other goods are\r\n      subject, and sometimes by bounties.\r\n\r\n      The importation of sheep’s wool from several different countries, of\r\n      cotton wool from all countries, of undressed flax, of the greater part of\r\n      dyeing drugs, of the greater part of undressed hides from Ireland, or the\r\n      British colonies, of seal skins from the British Greenland fishery, of pig\r\n      and bar iron from the British colonies, as well as of several other\r\n      materials of manufacture, has been encouraged by an exemption from all\r\n      duties, if properly entered at the custom-house. The private interest of\r\n      our merchants and manufacturers may, perhaps, have extorted from the\r\n      legislature these exemptions, as well as the greater part of our other\r\n      commercial regulations. They are, however, perfectly just and reasonable;\r\n      and if, consistently with the necessities of the state, they could be\r\n      extended to all the other materials of manufacture, the public would\r\n      certainly be a gainer.\r\n\r\n      The avidity of our great manufacturers, however, has in some cases\r\n      extended these exemptions a good deal beyond what can justly be considered\r\n      as the rude materials of their work. By the 24th Geo. II. chap. 46, a\r\n      small duty of only 1d. the pound was imposed upon the importation of\r\n      foreign brown linen yarn, instead of much higher duties, to which it had\r\n      been subjected before, viz. of 6d. the pound upon sail yarn, of 1s. the\r\n      pound upon all French and Dutch yarn, and of £2:13:4 upon the hundred\r\n      weight of all spruce or Muscovia yarn. But our manufacturers were not long\r\n      satisfied with this reduction: by the 29th of the same king, chap. 15, the\r\n      same law which gave a bounty upon the exportation of British and Irish\r\n      linen, of which the price did not exceed 18d. the yard, even this small\r\n      duty upon the importation of brown linen yarn was taken away. In the\r\n      different operations, however, which are necessary for the preparation of\r\n      linen yarn, a good deal more industry is employed, than in the subsequent\r\n      operation of preparing linen cloth from linen yarn. To say nothing of the\r\n      industry of the flax-growers and flaxdressers, three or four spinners at\r\n      least are necessary in order to keep one weaver in constant employment;\r\n      and more than four-fifths of the whole quantity of labour necessary for\r\n      the preparation of linen cloth, is employed in that of linen yarn; but our\r\n      spinners are poor people; women commonly scattered about in all different\r\n      parts of the country, without support or protection. It is not by the sale\r\n      of their work, but by that of the complete work of the weavers, that our\r\n      great master manufacturers make their profits. As it is their interest to\r\n      sell the complete manufacture as dear, so it is to buy the materials as\r\n      cheap as possible. By extorting from the legislature bounties upon the\r\n      exportation of their own linen, high duties upon the importation of all\r\n      foreign linen, and a total prohibition of the home consumption of some\r\n      sorts of French linen, they endeavour to sell their own goods as dear as\r\n      possible. By encouraging the importation of foreign linen yarn, and\r\n      thereby bringing it into competition with that which is made by our own\r\n      people, they endeavour to buy the work of the poor spinners as cheap as\r\n      possible. They are as intent to keep down the wages of their own weavers,\r\n      as the earnings of the poor spinners; and it is by no means for the\r\n      benefit of the workmen that they endeavour either to raise the price of\r\n      the complete work, or to lower that of the rude materials. It is the\r\n      industry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the powerful,\r\n      that is principally encouraged by our mercantile system. That which is\r\n      carried on for the benefit of the poor and the indigent is too often\r\n      either neglected or oppressed.\r\n\r\n      Both the bounty upon the exportation of linen, and the exemption from the\r\n      duty upon the importation of foreign yarn, which were granted only for\r\n      fifteen years, but continued by two different prolongations, expire with\r\n      the end of the session of parliament which shall immediately follow the\r\n      24th of June 1786.\r\n\r\n      The encouragement given to the importation of the materials of manufacture\r\n      by bounties, has been principally confined to such as were imported from\r\n      our American plantations.\r\n\r\n      The first bounties of this kind were those granted about the beginning of\r\n      the present century, upon the importation of naval stores from America.\r\n      Under this denomination were comprehended timber fit for masts, yards, and\r\n      bowsprits; hemp, tar, pitch, and turpentine. The bounty, however, of £1\r\n      the ton upon masting-timber, and that of £6 the ton upon hemp, were\r\n      extended to such as should be imported into England from Scotland. Both\r\n      these bounties continued, without any variation, at the same rate, till\r\n      they were severally allowed to expire; that upon hemp on the 1st of\r\n      January 1741, and that upon masting-timber at the end of the session of\r\n      parliament immediately following the 24th June 1781.\r\n\r\n      The bounties upon the importation of tar, pitch, and turpentine,\r\n      underwent, during their continuance, several alterations. Originally, that\r\n      upon tar was £4 the ton; that upon pitch the same; and that upon\r\n      turpentine £3 the ton. The bounty of £4 the ton upon tar was afterwards\r\n      confined to such as had been prepared in a particular manner; that upon\r\n      other good, clean, and merchantable tar was reduced to £2:4s. the ton. The\r\n      bounty upon pitch was likewise reduced to £1, and that upon turpentine to\r\n      £1:10s. the ton.\r\n\r\n      The second bounty upon the importation of any of the materials of\r\n      manufacture, according to the order of time, was that granted by the 21st\r\n      Geo. II. chap.30, upon the importation of indigo from the British\r\n      plantations. When the plantation indigo was worth three-fourths of the\r\n      price of the best French indigo, it was, by this act, entitled to a bounty\r\n      of 6d. the pound. This bounty, which, like most others, was granted only\r\n      for a limited time, was continued by several prolongations, but was\r\n      reduced to 4d. the pound. It was allowed to expire with the end of the\r\n      session of parliament which followed the 25th March 1781.\r\n\r\n      The third bounty of this kind was that granted (much about the time that\r\n      we were beginning sometimes to court, and sometimes to quarrel with our\r\n      American colonies), by the 4th. Geo. III. chap. 26, upon the importation\r\n      of hemp, or undressed flax, from the British plantations. This bounty was\r\n      granted for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1764 to the 24th June\r\n      1785. For the first seven years, it was to be at the rate of £8 the ton;\r\n      for the second at £6; and for the third at £4. It was not extended to\r\n      Scotland, of which the climate (although hemp is sometimes raised there in\r\n      small quantities, and of an inferior quality) is not very fit for that\r\n      produce. Such a bounty upon the importation of Scotch flax in England\r\n      would have been too great a discouragement to the native produce of the\r\n      southern part of the united kingdom.\r\n\r\n      The fourth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 5th Geo. III. chap.\r\n      45, upon the importation of wood from America. It was granted for nine\r\n      years from the 1st January 1766 to the 1st January 1775. During the first\r\n      three years, it was to be for every hundred-and-twenty good deals, at the\r\n      rate of £1, and for every load containing fifty cubic feet of other square\r\n      timber, at the rate of 12s. For the second three years, it was for deals,\r\n      to be at the rate of 15s., and for other squared timber at the rate of\r\n      8s.; and for the third three years, it was for deals, to be at the rate of\r\n      10s.; and for every other squared timber at the rate of 5s.\r\n\r\n      The fifth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 9th Geo. III. chap.\r\n      38, upon the importation of raw silk from the British plantations. It was\r\n      granted for twenty-one years, from the 1st January 1770, to the 1st\r\n      January 1791. For the first seven years, it was to be at the rate of £25\r\n      for every hundred pounds value; for the second, at £20; and for the third,\r\n      at £15. The management of the silk-worm, and the preparation of silk,\r\n      requires so much hand-labour, and labour is so very dear in America, that\r\n      even this great bounty, I have been informed, was not likely to produce\r\n      any considerable effect.\r\n\r\n      The sixth Bounty of this kind was that granted by 11th Geo. III. chap. 50,\r\n      for the importation of pipe, hogshead, and barrelstaves and leading from\r\n      the British plantations. It was granted for nine years, from 1st January\r\n      1772 to the 1st January 1781. For the first three years, it was, for a\r\n      certain quantity of each, to be at the rate of £6; for the second three\r\n      years at £4; and for the third three years at £2.\r\n\r\n      The seventh and last bounty of this kind was that granted by the 19th Geo.\r\n      III chap. 37, upon the importation of hemp from Ireland. It was granted in\r\n      the same manner as that for the importation of hemp and undressed flax\r\n      from America, for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1779 to the 24th\r\n      June 1800. The term is divided likewise into three periods, of seven years\r\n      each; and in each of those periods, the rate of the Irish bounty is the\r\n      same with that of the American. It does not, however, like the American\r\n      bounty, extend to the importation of undressed flax. It would have been\r\n      too great a discouragement to the cultivation of that plant in Great\r\n      Britain. When this last bounty was granted, the British and Irish\r\n      legislatures were not in much better humour with one another, than the\r\n      British and American had been before. But this boon to Ireland, it is to\r\n      be hoped, has been granted under more fortunate auspices than all those to\r\n      America. The same commodities, upon which we thus gave bounties, when\r\n      imported from America, were subjected to considerable duties when imported\r\n      from any other country. The interest of our American colonies was regarded\r\n      as the same with that of the mother country. Their wealth was considered\r\n      as our wealth. Whatever money was sent out to them, it was said, came all\r\n      back to us by the balance of trade, and we could never become a farthing\r\n      the poorer by any expense which we could lay out upon them. They were our\r\n      own in every respect, and it was an expense laid out upon the improvement\r\n      of our own property, and for the profitable employment of our own people.\r\n      It is unnecessary, I apprehend, at present to say anything further, in\r\n      order to expose the folly of a system which fatal experience has now\r\n      sufficiently exposed. Had our American colonies really been a part of\r\n      Great Britain, those bounties might have been considered as bounties upon\r\n      production, and would still have been liable to all the objections to\r\n      which such bounties are liable, but to no other.\r\n\r\n      The exportation of the materials of manufacture is sometimes discouraged\r\n      by absolute prohibitions, and sometimes by high duties.\r\n\r\n      Our woollen manufacturers have been more successful than any other class\r\n      of workmen, in persuading the legislature that the prosperity of the\r\n      nation depended upon the success and extension of their particular\r\n      business. They have not only obtained a monopoly against the consumers, by\r\n      an absolute prohibition of importing woollen cloths from any foreign\r\n      country; but they have likewise obtained another monopoly against the\r\n      sheep farmers and growers of wool, by a similar prohibition of the\r\n      exportation of live sheep and wool. The severity of many of the laws which\r\n      have been enacted for the security of the revenue is very justly\r\n      complained of, as imposing heavy penalties upon actions which, antecedent\r\n      to the statutes that declared them to be crimes, had always been\r\n      understood to be innocent. But the cruellest of our revenue laws, I will\r\n      venture to affirm, are mild and gentle, in comparison to some of those\r\n      which the clamour of our merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the\r\n      legislature, for the support of their own absurd and oppressive\r\n      monopolies. Like the laws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all\r\n      written in blood.\r\n\r\n      By the 8th of Elizabeth, chap. 3, the exporter of sheep, lambs, or rams,\r\n      was for the first offence, to forfeit all his goods for ever, to suffer a\r\n      year’s imprisonment, and then to have his left hand cut off in a market\r\n      town, upon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the second\r\n      offence, to be adjudged a felon, and to suffer death accordingly. To\r\n      prevent the breed of our sheep from being propagated in foreign countries,\r\n      seems to have been the object of this law. By the 13th and 14th of Charles\r\n      II. chap. 18, the exportation of wool was made felony, and the exporter\r\n      subjected to the same penalties and forfeitures as a felon.\r\n\r\n      For the honour of the national humanity, it is to be hoped that neither of\r\n      these statutes was ever executed. The first of them, however, so far as I\r\n      know, has never been directly repealed, and serjeant Hawkins seems to\r\n      consider it as still in force. It may, however, perhaps be considered as\r\n      virtually repealed by the 12th of Charles II. chap. 32, sect. 3, which,\r\n      without expressly taking away the penalties imposed by former statutes,\r\n      imposes a new penalty, viz. that of 20s. for every sheep exported, or\r\n      attempted to be exported, together with the forfeiture of the sheep, and\r\n      of the owner’s share of the sheep. The second of them was expressly\r\n      repealed by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 28, sect. 4, by which it\r\n      is declared that “Whereas the statute of the 13th and 14th of king Charles\r\n      II. made against the exportation of wool, among other things in the said\r\n      act mentioned, doth enact the same to be deemed felony, by the severity of\r\n      which penalty the prosecution of offenders hath not been so effectually\r\n      put in execution; be it therefore enacted, by the authority aforesaid,\r\n      that so much of the said act, which relates to the making the said offence\r\n      felony, be repealed and made void.”\r\n\r\n      The penalties, however, which are either imposed by this milder statute,\r\n      or which, though imposed by former statutes, are not repealed by this one,\r\n      are still sufficiently severe. Besides the forfeiture of the goods, the\r\n      exporter incurs the penalty of 3s. for every pound weight of wool, either\r\n      exported or attempted to be exported, that is, about four or five times\r\n      the value. Any merchant, or other person convicted of this offence, is\r\n      disabled from requiring any debt or account belonging to him from any\r\n      factor or other person. Let his fortune be what it will, whether he is or\r\n      is not able to pay those heavy penalties, the law means to ruin him\r\n      completely. But, as the morals of the great body of the people are not yet\r\n      so corrupt as those of the contrivers of this statute, I have not heard\r\n      that any advantage has ever been taken of this clause. If the person\r\n      convicted of this offence is not able to pay the penalties within three\r\n      months after judgment, he is to be transported for seven years; and if he\r\n      returns before the expiration of that term, he is liable to the pains of\r\n      felony, without benefit of clergy. The owner of the ship, knowing this\r\n      offence, forfeits all his interest in the ship and furniture. The master\r\n      and mariners, knowing this offence, forfeit all their goods and chattels,\r\n      and suffer three months imprisonment. By a subsequent statute, the master\r\n      suffers six months imprisonment.\r\n\r\n      In order to prevent exportation, the whole inland commerce of wool is laid\r\n      under very burdensome and oppressive restrictions. It cannot be packed in\r\n      any box, barrel, cask, case, chest, or any other package, but only in\r\n      packs of leather or pack-cloth, on which must be marked on the outside the\r\n      words WOOL or YARN, in large letters, not less than three inches long, on\r\n      pain of forfeiting the same and the package, and 8s. for every pound\r\n      weight, to be paid by the owner or packer. It cannot be loaden on any\r\n      horse or cart, or carried by land within five miles of the coast, but\r\n      between sun-rising, and sun-setting, on pain of forfeiting the same, the\r\n      horses and carriages. The hundred next adjoining to the sea coast, out of,\r\n      or through which the wool is carried or exported, forfeits £20, if the\r\n      wool is under the value of £10; and if of greater value, then treble that\r\n      value, together with treble costs, to be sued for within the year. The\r\n      execution to be against any two of the inhabitants, whom the sessions must\r\n      reimburse, by an assessment on the other inhabitants, as in the cases of\r\n      robbery. And if any person compounds with the hundred for less than this\r\n      penalty, he is to be imprisoned for five years; and any other person may\r\n      prosecute. These regulations take place through the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\n      But in the particular counties of Kent and Sussex, the restrictions are\r\n      still more troublesome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the sea\r\n      coast must give an account in writing, three days after shearing, to the\r\n      next officer of the customs, of the number of his fleeces, and of the\r\n      places where they are lodged. And before he removes any part of them, he\r\n      must give the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces, and of\r\n      the name and abode of the person to whom they are sold, and of the place\r\n      to which it is intended they should be carried. No person within fifteen\r\n      miles of the sea, in the said counties, can buy any wool, before he enters\r\n      into bond to the king, that no part of the wool which he shall so buy\r\n      shall be sold by him to any other person within fifteen miles of the sea.\r\n      If any wool is found carrying towards the sea side in the said counties,\r\n      unless it has been entered and security given as aforesaid, it is\r\n      forfeited, and the offender also forfeits 3s. for every pound weight, if\r\n      any person lay any wool, not entered as aforesaid, within fifteen miles of\r\n      the sea, it must be seized and forfeited; and if, after such seizure, any\r\n      person shall claim the same, he must give security to the exchequer, that\r\n      if he is cast upon trial he shall pay treble costs, besides all other\r\n      penalties.\r\n\r\n      When such restrictions are imposed upon the inland trade, the coasting\r\n      trade, we may believe, cannot be left very free. Every owner of wool, who\r\n      carrieth, or causeth to be carried, any wool to any port or place on the\r\n      sea coast, in order to be from thence transported by sea to any other\r\n      place or port on the coast, must first cause an entry thereof to be made\r\n      at the port from whence it is intended to be conveyed, containing the\r\n      weight, marks, and number, of the packages, before he brings the same\r\n      within five miles of that port, on pain of forfeiting the same, and also\r\n      the horses, carts, and other carriages; and also of suffering and\r\n      forfeiting, as by the other laws in force against the exportation of wool.\r\n      This law, however (1st of William III. chap. 32), is so very indulgent as\r\n      to declare, that this shall not hinder any person from carrying his wool\r\n      home from the place of shearing, though it be within five miles of the\r\n      sea, provided that in ten days after shearing, and before he remove the\r\n      wool, he do under his hand certify to the next officer of the customs the\r\n      true number of fleeces, and where it is housed; and do not remove the\r\n      same, without certifying to such officer, under his hand, his intention so\r\n      to do, three days before. Bond must be given that the wool to be carried\r\n      coast-ways is to be landed at the particular port for which it is entered\r\n      outwards; and if my part of it is landed without the presence of an\r\n      officer, not only the forfeiture of the wool is incurred, as in other\r\n      goods, but the usual additional penalty of 3s. for every pound weight is\r\n      likewise incurred.\r\n\r\n      Our woollen manufacturers, in order to justify their demand of such\r\n      extraordinary restrictions and regulations, confidently asserted, that\r\n      English wool was of a peculiar quality, superior to that of any other\r\n      country; that the wool of other countries could not, without some mixture\r\n      of it, be wrought up into any tolerable manufacture; that fine cloth could\r\n      not be made without it; that England, therefore, if the exportation of it\r\n      could be totally prevented, could monopolize to herself almost the whole\r\n      woollen trade of the world; and thus, having no rivals, could sell at what\r\n      price she pleased, and in a short time acquire the most incredible degree\r\n      of wealth by the most advantageous balance of trade. This doctrine, like\r\n      most other doctrines which are confidently asserted by any considerable\r\n      number of people, was, and still continues to be, most implicitly believed\r\n      by a much greater number: by almost all those who are either unacquainted\r\n      with the woollen trade, or who have not made particular inquiries. It is,\r\n      however, so perfectly false, that English wool is in any respect necessary\r\n      for the making of fine cloth, that it is altogether unfit for it. Fine\r\n      cloth is made altogether of Spanish wool. English wool, cannot be even so\r\n      mixed with Spanish wool, as to enter into the composition without spoiling\r\n      and degrading, in some degree, the fabric of the cloth.\r\n\r\n      It has been shown in the foregoing part of this work, that the effect of\r\n      these regulations has been to depress the price of English wool, not only\r\n      below what it naturally would be in the present times, but very much below\r\n      what it actually was in the time of Edward III. The price of Scotch wool,\r\n      when, in consequence of the Union, it became subject to the same\r\n      regulations, is said to have fallen about one half. It is observed by the\r\n      very accurate and intelligent author of the Memoirs of Wool, the Reverend\r\n      Mr John Smith, that the price of the best English wool in England, is\r\n      generally below what wool of a very inferior quality commonly sells for in\r\n      the market of Amsterdam. To depress the price of this commodity below what\r\n      may be called its natural and proper price, was the avowed purpose of\r\n      those regulations; and there seems to be no doubt of their having produced\r\n      the effect that was expected from them.\r\n\r\n      This reduction of price, it may perhaps be thought, by discouraging the\r\n      growing of wool, must have reduced very much the annual produce of that\r\n      commodity, though not below what it formerly was, yet below what, in the\r\n      present state of things, it would probably have been, had it, in\r\n      consequence of an open and free market, been allowed to rise to the\r\n      natural and proper price. I am, however, disposed to believe, that the\r\n      quantity of the annual produce cannot have been much, though it may,\r\n      perhaps, have been a little affected by these regulations. The growing of\r\n      wool is not the chief purpose for which the sheep farmer employs his\r\n      industry and stock. He expects his profit, not so much from the price of\r\n      the fleece, as from that of the carcase; and the average or ordinary price\r\n      of the latter must even, in many cases, make up to him whatever deficiency\r\n      there may be in the average or ordinary price of the former. It has been\r\n      observed, in the foregoing part of this work, that ‘whatever regulations\r\n      tend to sink the price, either of wool or of raw hides, below what it\r\n      naturally would be, must, in an improved and cultivated country, have some\r\n      tendency to raise the price of butcher’s meat. The price, both of the\r\n      great and small cattle which are fed on improved and cultivated land, must\r\n      be sufficient to pay the rent which the landlord, and the profit which the\r\n      farmer, has reason to expect from improved and cultivated land. If it is\r\n      not, they will soon cease to feed them. Whatever part of this price,\r\n      therefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide, must be paid by the\r\n      carcase. The less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid for the\r\n      other. In what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts\r\n      of the beast, is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it is\r\n      all paid to them. In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their\r\n      interest as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such\r\n      regulations, though their interest as consumers may, by the rise in the\r\n      price of provisions.’ According to this reasoning, therefore, this\r\n      degradation in the price of wool is not likely, in an improved and\r\n      cultivated country, to occasion any diminution in the annual produce of\r\n      that commodity; except so far as, by raising the price of mutton, it may\r\n      somewhat diminish the demand for, and consequently the production of, that\r\n      particular species of butcher’s meat, Its effect, however, even in this\r\n      way, it is probable, is not very considerable.\r\n\r\n      But though its effect upon the quantity of the annual produce may not have\r\n      been very considerable, its effect upon the quality, it may perhaps be\r\n      thought, must necessarily have been very great. The degradation in the\r\n      quality of English wool, if not below what it was in former times, yet\r\n      below what it naturally would have been in the present state of\r\n      improvement and cultivation, must have been, it may perhaps be supposed,\r\n      very nearly in proportion to the degradation of price. As the quality\r\n      depends upon the breed, upon the pasture, and upon the management and\r\n      cleanliness of the sheep, during the whole progress of the growth of the\r\n      fleece, the attention to these circumstances, it may naturally enough be\r\n      imagined, can never be greater than in proportion to the recompence which\r\n      the price of the fleece is likely to make for the labour and expense which\r\n      that attention requires. It happens, however, that the goodness of the\r\n      fleece depends, in a great measure, upon the health, growth, and bulk of\r\n      the animal: the same attention which is necessary for the improvement of\r\n      the carcase is, in some respect, sufficient for that of the fleece.\r\n      Notwithstanding the degradation of price, English wool is said to have\r\n      been improved considerably during the course even of the present century.\r\n      The improvement, might, perhaps, have been greater if the price had been\r\n      better; but the lowness of price, though it may have obstructed, yet\r\n      certainly it has not altogether prevented that improvement.\r\n\r\n      The violence of these regulations, therefore, seems to have affected\r\n      neither the quantity nor the quality of the annual produce of wool, so\r\n      much as it might have been expected to do (though I think it probable that\r\n      it may have affected the latter a good deal more than the former); and the\r\n      interest of the growers of wool, though it must have been hurt in some\r\n      degree, seems upon the whole, to have been much less hurt than could well\r\n      have been imagined.\r\n\r\n      These considerations, however, will not justify the absolute prohibition\r\n      of the exportation of wool; but they will fully justify the imposition of\r\n      a considerable tax upon that exportation.\r\n\r\n      To hurt, in any degree, the interest of any one order of citizens, for no\r\n      other purpose but to promote that of some other, is evidently contrary to\r\n      that justice and equality of treatment which the sovereign owes to all the\r\n      different orders of his subjects. But the prohibition certainly hurts, in\r\n      some degree, the interest of the growers of wool, for no other purpose but\r\n      to promote that of the manufacturers.\r\n\r\n      Every different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the support of\r\n      the sovereign or commonwealth. A tax of five, or even of ten shillings,\r\n      upon the exportation of every tod of wool, would produce a very\r\n      considerable revenue to the sovereign. It would hurt the interest of the\r\n      growers somewhat less than the prohibition, because it would not probably\r\n      lower the price of wool quite so much. It would afford a sufficient\r\n      advantage to the manufacturer, because, though he might not buy his wool\r\n      altogether so cheap as under the prohibition, he would still buy it at\r\n      least five or ten shillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could\r\n      buy it, besides saving the freight and insurance which the other would be\r\n      obliged to pay. It is scarce possible to devise a tax which could produce\r\n      any considerable revenue to the sovereign, and at the same time occasion\r\n      so little inconveniency to anybody.\r\n\r\n      The prohibition, notwithstanding all the penalties which guard it, does\r\n      not prevent the exportation of wool. It is exported, it is well known, in\r\n      great quantities. The great difference between the price in the home and\r\n      that in the foreign market, presents such a temptation to smuggling, that\r\n      all the rigour of the law cannot prevent it. This illegal exportation is\r\n      advantageous to nobody but the smuggler. A legal exportation, subject to a\r\n      tax, by affording a revenue to the sovereign, and thereby saving the\r\n      imposition of some other, perhaps more burdensome and inconvenient taxes,\r\n      might prove advantageous to all the different subjects of the state.\r\n\r\n      The exportation of fuller’s earth, or fuller’s clay, supposed to be\r\n      necessary for preparing and cleansing the woollen manufactures, has been\r\n      subjected to nearly the same penalties as the exportation of wool. Even\r\n      tobacco-pipe clay, though acknowledged to be different from fuller’s clay,\r\n      yet, on account of their resemblance, and because fuller’s clay might\r\n      sometimes be exported as tobacco-pipe clay, has been laid under the same\r\n      prohibitions and penalties.\r\n\r\n      By the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap, 7, the exportation, not only of\r\n      raw hides, but of tanned leather, except in the shape of boots, shoes, or\r\n      slippers, was prohibited; and the law gave a monopoly to our boot-makers\r\n      and shoe-makers, not only against our graziers, but against our tanners.\r\n      By subsequent statutes, our tanners have got themselves exempted from this\r\n      monopoly, upon paying a small tax of only one shilling on the hundred\r\n      weight of tanned leather, weighing one hundred and twelve pounds. They\r\n      have obtained likewise the drawback of two-thirds of the excise duties\r\n      imposed upon their commodity, even when exported without further\r\n      manufacture. All manufactures of leather may be exported duty free; and\r\n      the exporter is besides entitled to the drawback of the whole duties of\r\n      excise. Our graziers still continue subject to the old monopoly. Graziers,\r\n      separated from one another, and dispersed through all the different\r\n      corners of the country, cannot, without great difficulty, combine together\r\n      for the purpose either of imposing monopolies upon their fellow-citizens,\r\n      or of exempting themselves from such as may have been imposed upon them by\r\n      other people. Manufacturers of all kinds, collected together in numerous\r\n      bodies in all great cities, easily can. Even the horns of cattle are\r\n      prohibited to be exported; and the two insignificant trades of the horner\r\n      and comb-maker enjoy, in this respect, a monopoly against the graziers.\r\n\r\n      Restraints, either by prohibitions, or by taxes, upon the exportation of\r\n      goods which are partially, but not completely manufactured, are not\r\n      peculiar to the manufacture of leather. As long as anything remains to be\r\n      done, in order to fit any commodity for immediate use and consumption, our\r\n      manufacturers think that they themselves ought to have the doing of it.\r\n      Woollen yarn and worsted are prohibited to be exported, under the same\r\n      penalties as wool even white cloths we subject to a duty upon exportation;\r\n      and our dyers have so far obtained a monopoly against our clothiers. Our\r\n      clothiers would probably have been able to defend themselves against it;\r\n      but it happens that the greater part of our principal clothiers are\r\n      themselves likewise dyers. Watch-cases, clock-cases, and dial-plates for\r\n      clocks and watches, have been prohibited to be exported. Our clock-makers\r\n      and watch-makers are, it seems, unwilling that the price of this sort of\r\n      workmanship should be raised upon them by the competition of foreigners.\r\n\r\n      By some old statutes of Edward III, Henry VIII. and Edward VI. the\r\n      exportation of all metals was prohibited. Lead and tin were alone\r\n      excepted, probably on account of the great abundance of those metals; in\r\n      the exportation of which a considerable part of the trade of the kingdom\r\n      in those days consisted. For the encouragement of the mining trade, the\r\n      5th of William and Mary, chap.17, exempted from this prohibition iron,\r\n      copper, and mundic metal made from British ore. The exportation of all\r\n      sorts of copper bars, foreign as well as British, was afterwards permitted\r\n      by the 9th and 10th of William III. chap 26. The exportation of\r\n      unmanufactured brass, of what is called gun-metal, bell-metal, and shroff\r\n      metal, still continues to be prohibited. Brass manufactures of all sorts\r\n      may be exported duty free.\r\n\r\n      The exportation of the materials of manufacture, where it is not\r\n      altogether prohibited, is, in many cases, subjected to considerable\r\n      duties.\r\n\r\n      By the 8th Geo. I. chap.15, the exportation of all goods, the produce of\r\n      manufacture of Great Britain, upon which any duties had been imposed by\r\n      former statutes, was rendered duty free. The following goods, however,\r\n      were excepted: alum, lead, lead-ore, tin, tanned leather, copperas, coals,\r\n      wool, cards, white woollen cloths, lapis calaminaris, skins of all sorts,\r\n      glue, coney hair or wool, hares wool, hair of all sorts, horses, and\r\n      litharge of lead. If you except horses, all these are either materials of\r\n      manufacture, or incomplete manufactures (which may be considered as\r\n      materials for still further manufacture), or instruments of trade. This\r\n      statute leaves them subject to all the old duties which had ever been\r\n      imposed upon them, the old subsidy, and one per cent. outwards.\r\n\r\n      By the same statute, a great number of foreign drugs for dyers use are\r\n      exempted from all duties upon importation. Each of them, however, is\r\n      afterwards subjected to a certain duty, not indeed a very heavy one, upon\r\n      exportation. Our dyers, it seems, while they thought it for their interest\r\n      to encourage the importation of those drugs, by an exemption from all\r\n      duties, thought it likewise for their own interest to throw some small\r\n      discouragement upon their exportation. The avidity, however, which\r\n      suggested this notable piece of mercantile ingenuity, most probably\r\n      disappointed itself of its object. It necessarily taught the importers to\r\n      be more careful than they might otherwise have been, that their\r\n      importation should not exceed what was necessary for the supply of the\r\n      home market. The home market was at all times likely to be more scantily\r\n      supplied; the commodities were at all times likely to be somewhat dearer\r\n      there than they would have been, had the exportation been rendered as free\r\n      as the importation.\r\n\r\n      By the above-mentioned statute, gum senega, or gum arabic, being among the\r\n      enumerated dyeing drugs, might be imported duty free. They were subjected,\r\n      indeed, to a small poundage duty, amounting only to threepence in the\r\n      hundred weight, upon their re-exportation. France enjoyed, at that time,\r\n      an exclusive trade to the country most productive of those drugs, that\r\n      which lies in the neighbourhood of the Senegal; and the British market\r\n      could not be easily supplied by the immediate importation of them from the\r\n      place of growth. By the 25th Geo. II. therefore, gum senega was allowed to\r\n      be imported (contrary to the general dispositions of the act of\r\n      navigation) from any part of Europe. As the law, however, did not mean to\r\n      encourage this species of trade, so contrary to the general principles of\r\n      the mercantile policy of England, it imposed a duty of ten shillings the\r\n      hundred weight upon such importation, and no part of this duty was to be\r\n      afterwards drawn back upon its exportation. The successful war which began\r\n      in 1755 gave Great Britain the same exclusive trade to those countries\r\n      which France had enjoyed before. Our manufactures, as soon as the peace\r\n      was made, endeavoured to avail themselves of this advantage, and to\r\n      establish a monopoly in their own favour both against the growers and\r\n      against the importers of this commodity. By the 5th of Geo. III.\r\n      therefore, chap. 37, the exportation of gum senega, from his majesty’s\r\n      dominions in Africa, was confined to Great Britain, and was subjected to\r\n      all the same restrictions, regulations, forfeitures, and penalties, as\r\n      that of the enumerated commodities of the British colonies in America and\r\n      the West Indies. Its importation, indeed, was subjected to a small duty of\r\n      sixpence the hundred weight; but its re-exportation was subjected to the\r\n      enormous duty of one pound ten shillings the hundred weight. It was the\r\n      intention of our manufacturers, that the whole produce of those countries\r\n      should be imported into Great Britain; and in order that they themselves\r\n      might be enabled to buy it at their own price, that no part of it should\r\n      be exported again, but at such an expense as would sufficiently discourage\r\n      that exportation. Their avidity, however, upon this, as well as upon many\r\n      other occasions, disappointed itself of its object. This enormous duty\r\n      presented such a temptation to smuggling, that great quantities of this\r\n      commodity were clandestinely exported, probably to all the manufacturing\r\n      countries of Europe, but particularly to Holland, not only from Great\r\n      Britain, but from Africa. Upon this account, by the 14th Geo. III.\r\n      chap.10, this duty upon exportation was reduced to five shillings the\r\n      hundred weight.\r\n\r\n      In the book of rates, according to which the old subsidy was levied,\r\n      beaver skins were estimated at six shillings and eight pence a piece; and\r\n      the different subsidies and imposts which, before the year 1722, had been\r\n      laid upon their importation, amounted to one-fifth part of the rate, or to\r\n      sixteen pence upon each skin; all of which, except half the old subsidy,\r\n      amounting only to twopence, was drawn back upon exportation. This duty,\r\n      upon the importation of so important a material of manufacture, had been\r\n      thought too high; and, in the year 1722, the rate was reduced to two\r\n      shillings and sixpence, which reduced the duty upon importation to\r\n      sixpence, and of this only one-half was to be drawn back upon exportation.\r\n      The same successful war put the country most productive of beaver under\r\n      the dominion of Great Britain; and beaver skins being among the enumerated\r\n      commodities, the exportation from America was consequently confined to the\r\n      market of Great Britain. Our manufacturers soon bethought themselves of\r\n      the advantage which they might make of this circumstance; and in the year\r\n      1764, the duty upon the importation of beaver skin was reduced to one\r\n      penny, but the duty upon exportation was raised to sevenpence each skin,\r\n      without any drawback of the duty upon importation. By the same law, a duty\r\n      of eighteen pence the pound was imposed upon the exportation of beaver\r\n      wool or woumbs, without making any alteration in the duty upon the\r\n      importation of that commodity, which, when imported by British, and in\r\n      British shipping, amounted at that time to between fourpence and fivepence\r\n      the piece.\r\n\r\n      Coals may be considered both as a material of manufacture, and as an\r\n      instrument of trade. Heavy duties, accordingly, have been imposed upon\r\n      their exportation, amounting at present (1783) to more than five shillings\r\n      the ton, or more than fifteen shillings the chaldron, Newcastle measure;\r\n      which is, in most cases, more than the original value of the commodity at\r\n      the coal-pit, or even at the shipping port for exportation.\r\n\r\n      The exportation, however, of the instruments of trade, properly so called,\r\n      is commonly restrained, not by high duties, but by absolute prohibitions.\r\n      Thus, by the 7th and 8th of William III chap.20, sect.8, the exportation\r\n      of frames or engines for knitting gloves or stockings, is prohibited,\r\n      under the penalty, not only of the forfeiture of such frames or engines,\r\n      so exported, or attempted to be exported, but of forty pounds, one half to\r\n      the king, the other to the person who shall inform or sue for the same. In\r\n      the same manner, by the 14th Geo. III. chap. 71, the exportation to\r\n      foreign parts, of any utensils made use of in the cotton, linen, woollen,\r\n      and silk manufactures, is prohibited under the penalty, not only of the\r\n      forfeiture of such utensils, but of two hundred pounds, to be paid by the\r\n      person who shall offend in this manner; and likewise of two hundred\r\n      pounds, to be paid by the master of the ship, who shall knowingly suffer\r\n      such utensils to be loaded on board his ship.\r\n\r\n      When such heavy penalties were imposed upon the exportation of the dead\r\n      instruments of trade, it could not well be expected that the living\r\n      instrument, the artificer, should be allowed to go free. Accordingly, by\r\n      the 5th Geo. I. chap. 27, the person who shall be convicted of enticing\r\n      any artificer, of or in any of the manufactures of Great Britain, to go\r\n      into any foreign parts, in order to practise or teach his trade, is\r\n      liable, for the first offence, to be fined in any sum not exceeding one\r\n      hundred pounds, and to three months imprisonment, and until the fine shall\r\n      be paid; and for the second offence, to be fined in any sum, at the\r\n      discretion of the court, and to imprisonment for twelve months, and until\r\n      the fine shall be paid. By the 23d Geo. II. chap. 13, this penalty is\r\n      increased, for the first offence, to five hundred pounds for every\r\n      artificer so enticed, and to twelve months imprisonment, and until the\r\n      fine shall be paid; and for the second offence, to one thousand pounds,\r\n      and to two years imprisonment, and until the fine shall be paid.\r\n\r\n      By the former of these two statutes, upon proof that any person has been\r\n      enticing any artificer, or that any artificer has promised or contracted\r\n      to go into foreign parts, for the purposes aforesaid, such artificer may\r\n      be obliged to give security, at the discretion of the court, that he shall\r\n      not go beyond the seas, and may be committed to prison until he give such\r\n      security.\r\n\r\n      If any artificer has gone beyond the seas, and is exercising or teaching\r\n      his trade in any foreign country, upon warning being given to him by any\r\n      of his majesty’s ministers or consuls abroad, or by one of his majesty’s\r\n      secretaries of state, for the time being, if he does not, within six\r\n      months after such warning, return into this realm, and from henceforth\r\n      abide and inhabit continually within the same, he is from thenceforth\r\n      declared incapable of taking any legacy devised to him within this\r\n      kingdom, or of being executor or administrator to any person, or of taking\r\n      any lands within this kingdom, by descent, devise, or purchase. He\r\n      likewise forfeits to the king all his lands, goods, and chattels; is\r\n      declared an alien in every respect; and is put out of the king’s\r\n      protection.\r\n\r\n      It is unnecessary, I imagine, to observe how contrary such regulations are\r\n      to the boasted liberty of the subject, of which we affect to be so very\r\n      jealous; but which, in this case, is so plainly sacrificed to the futile\r\n      interests of our merchants and manufacturers.\r\n\r\n      The laudable motive of all these regulations, is to extend our own\r\n      manufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the depression of those\r\n      of all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as possible, to the\r\n      troublesome competition of such odious and disagreeable rivals. Our master\r\n      manufacturers think it reasonable that they themselves should have the\r\n      monopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen. Though by restraining,\r\n      in some trades, the number of apprentices which can be employed at one\r\n      time, and by imposing the necessity of a long apprenticeship in all\r\n      trades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine the knowledge of their\r\n      respective employments to as small a number as possible; they are\r\n      unwilling, however, that any part of this small number should go abroad to\r\n      instruct foreigners.\r\n\r\n      Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the\r\n      interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be\r\n      necessary for promoting that of the consumer.\r\n\r\n      The maxim is so perfectly self-evident, that it would be absurd to attempt\r\n      to prove it. But in the mercantile system, the interest of the consumer is\r\n      almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to\r\n      consider production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object\r\n      of all industry and commerce.\r\n\r\n      In the restraints upon the importation of all foreign commodities which\r\n      can come into competition with those of our own growth or manufacture, the\r\n      interest of the home consumer is evidently sacrificed to that of the\r\n      producer. It is altogether for the benefit of the latter, that the former\r\n      is obliged to pay that enhancement of price which this monopoly almost\r\n      always occasions.\r\n\r\n      It is altogether for the benefit of the producer, that bounties are\r\n      granted upon the exportation of some of his productions. The home consumer\r\n      is obliged to pay, first the tax which is necessary for paying the bounty;\r\n      and, secondly, the still greater tax which necessarily arises from the\r\n      enhancement of the price of the commodity in the home market.\r\n\r\n      By the famous treaty of commerce with Portugal, the consumer is prevented\r\n      by duties from purchasing of a neighbouring country, a commodity which our\r\n      own climate does not produce; but is obliged to purchase it of a distant\r\n      country, though it is acknowledged, that the commodity of the distant\r\n      country is of a worse quality than that of the near one. The home consumer\r\n      is obliged to submit to this inconvenience, in order that the producer may\r\n      import into the distant country some of his productions, upon more\r\n      advantageous terms than he otherwise would have been allowed to do. The\r\n      consumer, too, is obliged to pay whatever enhancement in the price of\r\n      those very productions this forced exportation may occasion in the home\r\n      market.\r\n\r\n      But in the system of laws which has been established for the management of\r\n      our American and West Indian colonies, the interest of the home consumer\r\n      has been sacrificed to that of the producer, with a more extravagant\r\n      profusion than in all our other commercial regulations. A great empire has\r\n      been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers,\r\n      who should be obliged to buy, from the shops of our different producers,\r\n      all the goods with which these could supply them. For the sake of that\r\n      little enhancement of price which this monopoly might afford our\r\n      producers, the home consumers have been burdened with the whole expense of\r\n      maintaining and defending that empire. For this purpose, and for this\r\n      purpose only, in the two last wars, more than two hundred millions have\r\n      been spent, and a new debt of more than a hundred and seventy millions has\r\n      been contracted, over and above all that had been expended for the same\r\n      purpose in former wars. The interest of this debt alone is not only\r\n      greater than the whole extraordinary profit which, it never could be\r\n      pretended, was made by the monopoly of the colony trade, but than the\r\n      whole value of that trade, or than the whole value of the goods which, at\r\n      an average, have been annually exported to the colonies.\r\n\r\n      It cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of\r\n      this whole mercantile system; not the consumers, we may believe, whose\r\n      interest has been entirely neglected; but the producers, whose interest\r\n      has been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class, our\r\n      merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects. In\r\n      the mercantile regulations which have been taken notice of in this\r\n      chapter, the interest of our manufacturers has been most peculiarly\r\n      attended to; and the interest, not so much of the consumers, as that of\r\n      some other sets of producers, has been sacrificed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nOF THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, OR OF\r\nTHOSE SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WHICH REPRESENT THE PRODUCE OF LAND, AS\r\nEITHER THE SOLE OR THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF THE REVENUE AND WEALTH OF EVERY\r\nCOUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The agricultural systems of political economy will not require so long an\r\n      explanation as that which I have thought it necessary to bestow upon the\r\n      mercantile or commercial system.\r\n\r\n      That system which represents the produce of land as the sole source of the\r\n      revenue and wealth of every country, has so far as I know, never been\r\n      adopted by any nation, and it at present exists only in the speculations\r\n      of a few men of great learning and ingenuity in France. It would not,\r\n      surely, be worth while to examine at great length the errors of a system\r\n      which never has done, and probably never will do, any harm in any part of\r\n      the world. I shall endeavour to explain, however, as distinctly as I can,\r\n      the great outlines of this very ingenious system.\r\n\r\n      Mr Colbert, the famous minister of Lewis XIV. was a man of probity, of\r\n      great industry, and knowledge of detail; of great experience and acuteness\r\n      in the examination of public accounts; and of abilities, in short, every\r\n      way fitted for introducing method and good order into the collection and\r\n      expenditure of the public revenue. That minister had unfortunately\r\n      embraced all the prejudices of the mercantile system, in its nature and\r\n      essence a system of restraint and regulation, and such as could scarce\r\n      fail to be agreeable to a laborious and plodding man of business, who had\r\n      been accustomed to regulate the different departments of public offices,\r\n      and to establish the necessary checks and controls for confining each to\r\n      its proper sphere. The industry and commerce of a great country, he\r\n      endeavoured to regulate upon the same model as the departments of a public\r\n      office; and instead of allowing every man to pursue his own interest his\r\n      own way, upon the liberal plan of equality, liberty, and justice, he\r\n      bestowed upon certain branches of industry extraordinary privileges, while\r\n      he laid others under as extraordinary restraints. He was not only\r\n      disposed, like other European ministers, to encourage more the industry of\r\n      the towns than that of the country; but, in order to support the industry\r\n      of the towns, he was willing even to depress and keep down that of the\r\n      country. In order to render provisions cheap to the inhabitants of the\r\n      towns, and thereby to encourage manufactures and foreign commerce, he\r\n      prohibited altogether the exportation of corn, and thus excluded the\r\n      inhabitants of the country from every foreign market, for by far the most\r\n      important part of the produce of their industry. This prohibition, joined\r\n      to the restraints imposed by the ancient provincial laws of France upon\r\n      the transportation of corn from one province to another, and to the\r\n      arbitrary and degrading taxes which are levied upon the cultivators in\r\n      almost all the provinces, discouraged and kept down the agriculture of\r\n      that country very much below the state to which it would naturally have\r\n      risen in so very fertile a soil, and so very happy a climate. This state\r\n      of discouragement and depression was felt more or less in every different\r\n      part of the country, and many different inquiries were set on foot\r\n      concerning the causes of it. One of those causes appeared to be the\r\n      preference given, by the institutions of Mr Colbert, to the industry of\r\n      the towns above that of the country.\r\n\r\n      If the rod be bent too much one way, says the proverb, in order to make it\r\n      straight, you must bend it as much the other. The French philosophers, who\r\n      have proposed the system which represents agriculture as the sole source\r\n      of the revenue and wealth of every country, seem to have adopted this\r\n      proverbial maxim; and, as in the plan of Mr Colbert, the industry of the\r\n      towns was certainly overvalued in comparison with that of the country, so\r\n      in their system it seems to be as certainly under-valued.\r\n\r\n      The different orders of people, who have ever been supposed to contribute\r\n      in any respect towards the annual produce of the land and labour of the\r\n      country, they divide into three classes. The first is the class of the\r\n      proprietors of land. The second is the class of the cultivators, of\r\n      farmers and country labourers, whom they honour with the peculiar\r\n      appellation of the productive class. The third is the class of artificers,\r\n      manufacturers, and merchants, whom they endeavour to degrade by the\r\n      humiliating appellation of the barren or unproductive class.\r\n\r\n      The class of proprietors contributes to the annual produce, by the expense\r\n      which they may occasionally lay out upon the improvement of the land, upon\r\n      the buildings, drains, inclosures, and other ameliorations, which they may\r\n      either make or maintain upon it, and by means of which the cultivators are\r\n      enabled, with the same capital, to raise a greater produce, and\r\n      consequently to pay a greater rent. This advanced rent may be considered\r\n      as the interest or profit due to the proprietor, upon the expense or\r\n      capital which he thus employs in the improvement of his land. Such\r\n      expenses are in this system called ground expenses (depenses foncieres).\r\n\r\n      The cultivators or farmers contribute to the annual produce, by what are\r\n      in this system called the original and annual expenses (depenses\r\n      primitives, et depenses annuelles), which they lay out upon the\r\n      cultivation of the land. The original expenses consist in the instruments\r\n      of husbandry, in the stock of cattle, in the seed, and in the maintenance\r\n      of the farmer’s family, servants, and cattle, during at least a great part\r\n      of the first year of his occupancy, or till he can receive some return\r\n      from the land. The annual expenses consist in the seed, in the wear and\r\n      tear of instruments of husbandry, and in the annual maintenance of the\r\n      farmer’s servants and cattle, and of his family too, so far as any part of\r\n      them can be considered as servants employed in cultivation. That part of\r\n      the produce of the land which remains to him after paying the rent, ought\r\n      to be sufficient, first, to replace to him, within a reasonable time, at\r\n      least during the term of his occupancy, the whole of his original\r\n      expenses, together with the ordinary profits of stock; and, secondly, to\r\n      replace to him annually the whole of his annual expenses, together\r\n      likewise with the ordinary profits of stock. Those two sorts of expenses\r\n      are two capitals which the farmer employs in cultivation; and unless they\r\n      are regularly restored to him, together with a reasonable profit, he\r\n      cannot carry on his employment upon a level with other employments; but,\r\n      from a regard to his own interest, must desert it as soon as possible, and\r\n      seek some other. That part of the produce of the land which is thus\r\n      necessary for enabling the farmer to continue his business, ought to be\r\n      considered as a fund sacred to cultivation, which, if the landlord\r\n      violates, he necessarily reduces the produce of his own land, and, in a\r\n      few years, not only disables the farmer from paying this racked rent, but\r\n      from paying the reasonable rent which he might otherwise have got for his\r\n      land. The rent which properly belongs to the landlord, is no more than the\r\n      neat produce which remains after paying, in the completest manner, all the\r\n      necessary expenses which must be previously laid out, in order to raise\r\n      the gross or the whole produce. It is because the labour of the\r\n      cultivators, over and above paying completely all those necessary\r\n      expenses, affords a neat produce of this kind, that this class of people\r\n      are in this system peculiarly distinguished by the honourable appellation\r\n      of the productive class. Their original and annual expenses are for the\r\n      same reason called, In this system, productive expenses, because, over and\r\n      above replacing their own value, they occasion the annual reproduction of\r\n      this neat produce.\r\n\r\n      The ground expenses, as they are called, or what the landlord lays out\r\n      upon the improvement of his land, are, in this system, too, honoured with\r\n      the appellation of productive expenses. Till the whole of those expenses,\r\n      together with the ordinary profits of stock, have been completely repaid\r\n      to him by the advanced rent which he gets from his land, that advanced\r\n      rent ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable, both by the church and\r\n      by the king; ought to be subject neither to tithe nor to taxation. If it\r\n      is otherwise, by discouraging the improvement of land, the church\r\n      discourages the future increase of her own tithes, and the king the future\r\n      increase of his own taxes. As in a well ordered state of things,\r\n      therefore, those ground expenses, over and above reproducing in the\r\n      completest manner their own value, occasion likewise, after a certain\r\n      time, a reproduction of a neat produce, they are in this system considered\r\n      as productive expenses.\r\n\r\n      The ground expenses of the landlord, however, together with the original\r\n      and the annual expenses of the farmer, are the only three sorts of\r\n      expenses which in this system are considered as productive. All other\r\n      expenses, and all other orders of people, even those who, in the common\r\n      apprehensions of men, are regarded as the most productive, are, in this\r\n      account of things, represented as altogether barren and unproductive.\r\n\r\n      Artificers and manufacturers, in particular, whose industry, in the common\r\n      apprehensions of men, increases so much the value of the rude produce of\r\n      land, are in this system represented as a class of people altogether\r\n      barren and unproductive. Their labour, it is said, replaces only the stock\r\n      which employs them, together with its ordinary profits. That stock\r\n      consists in the materials, tools, and wages, advanced to them by their\r\n      employer; and is the fund destined for their employment and maintenance.\r\n      Its profits are the fund destined for the maintenance of their employer.\r\n      Their employer, as he advances to them the stock of materials, tools, and\r\n      wages, necessary for their employment, so he advances to himself what is\r\n      necessary for his own maintenance; and this maintenance he generally\r\n      proportions to the profit which he expects to make by the price of their\r\n      work. Unless its price repays to him the maintenance which he advances to\r\n      himself, as well as the materials, tools, and wages, which he advances to\r\n      his workmen, it evidently does not repay to him the whole expense which he\r\n      lays out upon it. The profits of manufacturing stock, therefore, are not,\r\n      like the rent of land, a neat produce which remains after completely\r\n      repaying the whole expense which must be laid out in order to obtain them.\r\n      The stock of the farmer yields him a profit, as well as that of the master\r\n      manufacturer; and it yields a rent likewise to another person, which that\r\n      of the master manufacturer does not. The expense, therefore, laid out in\r\n      employing and maintaining artificers and manufacturers, does no more than\r\n      continue, if one may say so, the existence of its own value, and does not\r\n      produce any new value. It is, therefore, altogether a barren and\r\n      unproductive expense. The expense, on the contrary, laid out in employing\r\n      farmers and country labourers, over and above continuing the existence of\r\n      its own value, produces a new value the rent of the landlord. It is,\r\n      therefore, a productive expense.\r\n\r\n      Mercantile stock is equally barren and unproductive with manufacturing\r\n      stock. It only continues the existence of its own value, without producing\r\n      any new value. Its profits are only the repayment of the maintenance which\r\n      its employer advances to himself during the time that he employs it, or\r\n      till he receives the returns of it. They are only the repayment of a part\r\n      of the expense which must be laid out in employing it.\r\n\r\n      The labour of artificers and manufacturers never adds any thing to the\r\n      value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land. It adds,\r\n      indeed, greatly to the value of some particular parts of it. But the\r\n      consumption which, in the mean time, it occasions of other parts, is\r\n      precisely equal to the value which it adds to those parts; so that the\r\n      value of the whole amount is not, at any one moment of time, in the least\r\n      augmented by it. The person who works the lace of a pair of fine ruffles\r\n      for example, will sometimes raise the value of, perhaps, a pennyworth of\r\n      flax to £30 sterling. But though, at first sight, he appears thereby to\r\n      multiply the value of a part of the rude produce about seven thousand and\r\n      two hundred times, he in reality adds nothing to the value of the whole\r\n      annual amount of the rude produce. The working of that lace costs him,\r\n      perhaps, two years labour. The £30 which he gets for it when it is\r\n      finished, is no more than the repayment of the subsistence which he\r\n      advances to himself during the two years that he is employed about it. The\r\n      value which, by every day’s, month’s, or year’s labour, he adds to the\r\n      flax, does no more than replace the value of his own consumption during\r\n      that day, month, or year. At no moment of time, therefore, does he add any\r\n      thing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the\r\n      land: the portion of that produce which he is continually consuming, being\r\n      always equal to the value which he is continually producing. The extreme\r\n      poverty of the greater part of the persons employed in this expensive,\r\n      though trifling manufacture, may satisfy us that the price of their work\r\n      does not, in ordinary cases, exceed the value of their subsistence. It is\r\n      otherwise with the work of farmers and country labourers. The rent of the\r\n      landlord is a value which, in ordinary cases, it is continually producing\r\n      over and above replacing, in the most complete manner, the whole\r\n      consumption, the whole expense laid out upon the employment and\r\n      maintenance both of the workmen and of their employer.\r\n\r\n      Artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, can augment the revenue and\r\n      wealth of their society by parsimony only; or, as it is expressed in this\r\n      system, by privation, that is, by depriving themselves of a part of the\r\n      funds destined for their own subsistence. They annually reproduce nothing\r\n      but those funds. Unless, therefore, they annually save some part of them,\r\n      unless they annually deprive themselves of the enjoyment of some part of\r\n      them, the revenue and wealth of their society can never be, in the\r\n      smallest degree, augmented by means of their industry. Farmers and country\r\n      labourers, on the contrary, may enjoy completely the whole funds destined\r\n      for their own subsistence, and yet augment, at the same time, the revenue\r\n      and wealth of their society. Over and above what is destined for their own\r\n      subsistence, their industry annually affords a neat produce, of which the\r\n      augmentation necessarily augments the revenue and wealth of their society.\r\n      Nations, therefore, which, like France or England, consist in a great\r\n      measure, of proprietors and cultivators, can be enriched by industry and\r\n      enjoyment. Nations, on the contrary, which, like Holland and Hamburgh, are\r\n      composed chiefly of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, can grow\r\n      rich only through parsimony and privation. As the interest of nations so\r\n      differently circumstanced is very different, so is likewise the common\r\n      character of the people. In those of the former kind, liberality,\r\n      frankness, and good fellowship, naturally make a part of their common\r\n      character; in the latter, narrowness, meanness, and a selfish disposition,\r\n      averse to all social pleasure and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n      The unproductive class, that of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers,\r\n      is maintained and employed altogether at the expense of the two other\r\n      classes, of that of proprietors, and of that of cultivators. They furnish\r\n      it both with the materials of its work, and with the fund of its\r\n      subsistence, with the corn and cattle which it consumes while it is\r\n      employed about that work. The proprietors and cultivators finally pay both\r\n      the wages of all the workmen of the unproductive class, and the profits of\r\n      all their employers. Those workmen and their employers are properly the\r\n      servants of the proprietors and cultivators. They are only servants who\r\n      work without doors, as menial servants work within. Both the one and the\r\n      other, however, are equally maintained at the expense of the same masters.\r\n      The labour of both is equally unproductive. It adds nothing to the value\r\n      of the sum total of the rude produce of the land. Instead of increasing\r\n      the value of that sum total, it is a charge and expense which must be paid\r\n      out of it.\r\n\r\n      The unproductive class, however, is not only useful, but greatly useful,\r\n      to the other two classes. By means of the industry of merchants,\r\n      artificers, and manufacturers, the proprietors and cultivators can\r\n      purchase both the foreign goods and the manufactured produce of their own\r\n      country, which they have occasion for, with the produce of a much smaller\r\n      quantity of their own labour, than what they would be obliged to employ,\r\n      if they were to attempt, in an awkward and unskilful manner, either to\r\n      import the one, or to make the other, for their own use. By means of the\r\n      unproductive class, the cultivators are delivered from many cares, which\r\n      would otherwise distract their attention from the cultivation of land. The\r\n      superiority of produce, which in consequence of this undivided attention,\r\n      they are enabled to raise, is fully sufficient to pay the whole expense\r\n      which the maintenance and employment of the unproductive class costs\r\n      either the proprietors or themselves. The industry of merchants,\r\n      artificers, and manufacturers, though in its own nature altogether\r\n      unproductive, yet contributes in this manner indirectly to increase the\r\n      produce of the land. It increases the productive powers of productive\r\n      labour, by leaving it at liberty to confine itself to its proper\r\n      employment, the cultivation of land; and the plough goes frequently the\r\n      easier and the better, by means of the labour of the man whose business is\r\n      most remote from the plough.\r\n\r\n      It can never be the interest of the proprietors and cultivators, to\r\n      restrain or to discourage, in any respect, the industry of merchants,\r\n      artificers, and manufacturers. The greater the liberty which this\r\n      unproductive class enjoys, the greater will be the competition in all the\r\n      different trades which compose it, and the cheaper will the other two\r\n      classes be supplied, both with foreign goods and with the manufactured\r\n      produce of their own country.\r\n\r\n      It can never be the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the\r\n      other two classes. It is the surplus produce of the land, or what remains\r\n      after deducting the maintenance, first of the cultivators, and afterwards\r\n      of the proprietors, that maintains and employs the unproductive class. The\r\n      greater this surplus, the greater must likewise be the maintenance and\r\n      employment of that class. The establishment of perfect justice, of perfect\r\n      liberty, and of perfect equality, is the very simple secret which most\r\n      effectually secures the highest degree of prosperity to all the three\r\n      classes.\r\n\r\n      The merchants, artificers, and manufacturers of those mercantile states,\r\n      which, like Holland and Hamburgh, consist chiefly of this unproductive\r\n      class, are in the same manner maintained and employed altogether at the\r\n      expense of the proprietors and cultivators of land. The only difference\r\n      is, that those proprietors and cultivators are, the greater part of them,\r\n      placed at a most inconvenient distance from the merchants, artificers, and\r\n      manufacturers, whom they supply with the materials of their work and the\r\n      fund of their subsistence; are the inhabitants of other countries, and the\r\n      subjects of other governments.\r\n\r\n      Such mercantile states, however, are not only useful, but greatly useful,\r\n      to the inhabitants of those other countries. They fill up, in some\r\n      measure, a very important void; and supply the place of the merchants,\r\n      artificers, and manufacturers, whom the inhabitants of those countries\r\n      ought to find at home, but whom, from some defect in their policy, they do\r\n      not find at home.\r\n\r\n      It can never be the interest of those landed nations, if I may call them\r\n      so, to discourage or distress the industry of such mercantile states, by\r\n      imposing high duties upon their trade, or upon the commodities which they\r\n      furnish. Such duties, by rendering those commodities dearer, could serve\r\n      only to sink the real value of the surplus produce of their own land, with\r\n      which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of which those\r\n      commodities are purchased. Such duties could only serve to discourage the\r\n      increase of that surplus produce, and consequently the improvement and\r\n      cultivation of their own land. The most effectual expedient, on the\r\n      contrary, for raising the value of that surplus produce, for encouraging\r\n      its increase, and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their\r\n      own land, would be to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all\r\n      such mercantile nations.\r\n\r\n      This perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual expedient\r\n      for supplying them, in due time, with all the artificers, manufacturers,\r\n      and merchants, whom they wanted at home; and for filling up, in the\r\n      properest and most advantageous manner, that very important void which\r\n      they felt there.\r\n\r\n      The continual increase of the surplus produce of their land would, in due\r\n      time, create a greater capital than what would be employed with the\r\n      ordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land; and\r\n      the surplus part of it would naturally turn itself to the employment of\r\n      artificers and manufacturers, at home. But these artificers and\r\n      manufacturers, finding at home both the materials of their work and the\r\n      fund of their subsistence, might immediately, even with much less art and\r\n      skill be able to work as cheap as the little artificers and manufacturers\r\n      of such mercantile states, who had both to bring from a greater distance.\r\n      Even though, from want of art and skill, they might not for some time be\r\n      able to work as cheap, yet, finding a market at home, they might be able\r\n      to sell their work there as cheap as that of the artificers and\r\n      manufacturers of such mercantile states, which could not be brought to\r\n      that market but from so great a distance; and as their art and skill\r\n      improved, they would soon be able to sell it cheaper. The artificers and\r\n      manufacturers of such mercantile states, therefore, would immediately be\r\n      rivalled in the market of those landed nations, and soon after undersold\r\n      and justled out of it altogether. The cheapness of the manufactures of\r\n      those landed nations, in consequence of the gradual improvements of art\r\n      and skill, would, in due time, extend their sale beyond the home market,\r\n      and carry them to many foreign markets, from which they would, in the same\r\n      manner, gradually justle out many of the manufacturers of such mercantile\r\n      nations.\r\n\r\n      This continual increase, both of the rude and manufactured produce of\r\n      those landed nations, would, in due time, create a greater capital than\r\n      could, with the ordinary rate of profit, be employed either in agriculture\r\n      or in manufactures. The surplus of this capital would naturally turn\r\n      itself to foreign trade and be employed in exporting, to foreign\r\n      countries, such parts of the rude and manufactured produce of its own\r\n      country, as exceeded the demand of the home market. In the exportation of\r\n      the produce of their own country, the merchants of a landed nation would\r\n      have an advantage of the same kind over those of mercantile nations, which\r\n      its artificers and manufacturers had over the artificers and manufacturers\r\n      of such nations; the advantage of finding at home that cargo, and those\r\n      stores and provisions, which the others were obliged to seek for at a\r\n      distance. With inferior art and skill in navigation, therefore, they would\r\n      be able to sell that cargo as cheap in foreign markets as the merchants of\r\n      such mercantile nations; and with equal art and skill they would be able\r\n      to sell it cheaper. They would soon, therefore, rival those mercantile\r\n      nations in this branch of foreign trade, and, in due time, would justle\r\n      them out of it altogether.\r\n\r\n      According to this liberal and generous system, therefore, the most\r\n      advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers,\r\n      manufacturers, and merchants of its own, is to grant the most perfect\r\n      freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all\r\n      other nations. It thereby raises the value of the surplus produce of its\r\n      own land, of which the continual increase gradually establishes a fund,\r\n      which, in due time, necessarily raises up all the artificers,\r\n      manufacturers, and merchants, whom it has occasion for.\r\n\r\n      When a landed nation on the contrary, oppresses, either by high duties or\r\n      by prohibitions, the trade of foreign nations, it necessarily hurts its\r\n      own interest in two different ways. First, by raising the price of all\r\n      foreign goods, and of all sorts of manufactures, it necessarily sinks the\r\n      real value of the surplus produce of its own land, with which, or, what\r\n      comes to the same thing, with the price of which, it purchases those\r\n      foreign goods and manufactures. Secondly, by giving a sort of monopoly of\r\n      the home market to its own merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, it\r\n      raises the rate of mercantile and manufacturing profit, in proportion to\r\n      that of agricultural profit; and, consequently, either draws from\r\n      agriculture a part of the capital which had before been employed in it, or\r\n      hinders from going to it a part of what would otherwise have gone to it.\r\n      This policy, therefore, discourages agriculture in two different ways;\r\n      first, by sinking the real value of its produce, and thereby lowering the\r\n      rate of its profits; and, secondly, by raising the rate of profit in all\r\n      other employments. Agriculture is rendered less advantageous, and trade\r\n      and manufactures more advantageous, than they otherwise would be; and\r\n      every man is tempted by his own interest to turn, as much as he can, both\r\n      his capital and his industry from the former to the latter employments.\r\n\r\n      Though, by this oppressive policy, a landed nation should be able to raise\r\n      up artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of its own, somewhat sooner\r\n      than it could do by the freedom of trade; a matter, however, which is not\r\n      a little doubtful; yet it would raise them up, if one may say so,\r\n      prematurely, and before it was perfectly ripe for them. By raising up too\r\n      hastily one species of industry, it would depress another more valuable\r\n      species of industry. By raising up too hastily a species of industry which\r\n      duly replaces the stock which employs it, together with the ordinary\r\n      profit, it would depress a species of industry which, over and above\r\n      replacing that stock, with its profit, affords likewise a neat produce, a\r\n      free rent to the landlord. It would depress productive labour, by\r\n      encouraging too hastily that labour which is altogether barren and\r\n      unproductive.\r\n\r\n      In what manner, according to this system, the sum total of the annual\r\n      produce of the land is distributed among the three classes above\r\n      mentioned, and in what manner the labour of the unproductive class does no\r\n      more than replace the value of its own consumption, without increasing in\r\n      any respect the value of that sum total, is represented by Mr Quesnai, the\r\n      very ingenious and profound author of this system, in some arithmetical\r\n      formularies. The first of these formularies, which, by way of eminence, he\r\n      peculiarly distinguishes by the name of the Economical Table, represents\r\n      the manner in which he supposes this distribution takes place, in a state\r\n      of the most perfect liberty, and, therefore, of the highest prosperity; in\r\n      a state where the annual produce is such as to afford the greatest\r\n      possible neat produce, and where each class enjoys its proper share of the\r\n      whole annual produce. Some subsequent formularies represent the manner in\r\n      which he supposes this distribution is made in different states of\r\n      restraint and regulation; in which, either the class of proprietors, or\r\n      the barren and unproductive class, is more favoured than the class of\r\n      cultivators; and in which either the one or the other encroaches, more or\r\n      less, upon the share which ought properly to belong to this productive\r\n      class. Every such encroachment, every violation of that natural\r\n      distribution, which the most perfect liberty would establish, must,\r\n      according to this system, necessarily degrade, more or less, from one year\r\n      to another, the value and sum total of the annual produce, and must\r\n      necessarily occasion a gradual declension in the real wealth and revenue\r\n      of the society; a declension, of which the progress must be quicker or\r\n      slower, according to the degree of this encroachment, according as that\r\n      natural distribution, which the most perfect liberty would establish, is\r\n      more or less violated. Those subsequent formularies represent the\r\n      different degrees of declension which, according to this system,\r\n      correspond to the different degrees in which this natural distribution of\r\n      things is violated.\r\n\r\n      Some speculative physicians seem to have imagined that the health of the\r\n      human body could be preserved only by a certain precise regimen of diet\r\n      and exercise, of which every, the smallest violation, necessarily\r\n      occasioned some degree of disease or disorder proportionate to the degree\r\n      of the violation. Experience, however, would seem to shew, that the human\r\n      body frequently preserves, to all appearance at least, the most perfect\r\n      state of health under a vast variety of different regimens; even under\r\n      some which are generally believed to be very far from being perfectly\r\n      wholesome. But the healthful state of the human body, it would seem,\r\n      contains in itself some unknown principle of preservation, capable either\r\n      of preventing or of correcting, in many respects, the bad effects even of\r\n      a very faulty regimen. Mr Quesnai, who was himself a physician, and a very\r\n      speculative physician, seems to have entertained a notion of the same kind\r\n      concerning the political body, and to have imagined that it would thrive\r\n      and prosper only under a certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of\r\n      perfect liberty and perfect justice. He seems not to have considered, that\r\n      in the political body, the natural effort which every man is continually\r\n      making to better his own condition, is a principle of preservation capable\r\n      of preventing and correcting, in many respects, the bad effects of a\r\n      political economy, in some degree both partial and oppressive. Such a\r\n      political economy, though it no doubt retards more or less, is not always\r\n      capable of stopping altogether, the natural progress of a nation towards\r\n      wealth and prosperity, and still less of making it go backwards. If a\r\n      nation could not prosper without the enjoyment of perfect liberty and\r\n      perfect justice, there is not in the world a nation which could ever have\r\n      prospered. In the political body, however, the wisdom of nature has\r\n      fortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad effects of\r\n      the folly and injustice of man; it the same manner as it has done in the\r\n      natural body, for remedying those of his sloth and intemperance.\r\n\r\n      The capital error of this system, however, seems to lie in its\r\n      representing the class of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, as\r\n      altogether barren and unproductive. The following observations may serve\r\n      to shew the impropriety of this representation:—\r\n\r\n      First, this class, it is acknowledged, reproduces annually the value of\r\n      its own annual consumption, and continues, at least, the existence of the\r\n      stock or capital which maintains and employs it. But, upon this account\r\n      alone, the denomination of barren or unproductive should seem to be very\r\n      improperly applied to it. We should not call a marriage barren or\r\n      unproductive, though it produced only a son and a daughter, to replace the\r\n      father and mother, and though it did not increase the number of the human\r\n      species, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and country\r\n      labourers, indeed, over and above the stock which maintains and employs\r\n      them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a free rent to the landlord. As a\r\n      marriage which affords three children is certainly more productive than\r\n      one which affords only two, so the labour of farmers and country labourers\r\n      is certainly more productive than that of merchants, artificers, and\r\n      manufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however, does not,\r\n      render the other barren or unproductive.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, it seems, on this account, altogether improper to consider\r\n      artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the same light as menial\r\n      servants. The labour of menial servants does not continue the existence of\r\n      the fund which maintains and employs them. Their maintenance and\r\n      employment is altogether at the expense of their masters, and the work\r\n      which they perform is not of a nature to repay that expense. That work\r\n      consists in services which perish generally in the very instant of their\r\n      performance, and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible commodity,\r\n      which can replace the value of their wages and maintenance. The labour, on\r\n      the contrary, of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, naturally does\r\n      fix and realize itself in some such vendible commodity. It is upon this\r\n      account that, in the chapter in which I treat of productive and\r\n      unproductive labour, I have classed artificers, manufacturers, and\r\n      merchants among the productive labourers, and menial servants among the\r\n      barren or unproductive.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, it seems, upon every supposition, improper to say, that the\r\n      labour of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, does not increase the\r\n      real revenue of the society. Though we should suppose, for example, as it\r\n      seems to be supposed in this system, that the value of the daily, monthly,\r\n      and yearly consumption of this class was exactly equal to that of its\r\n      daily, monthly, and yearly production; yet it would not from thence\r\n      follow, that its labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the real\r\n      value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the society. An\r\n      artificer, for example, who, in the first six months after harvest,\r\n      executes ten pounds worth of work, though he should, in the same time,\r\n      consume ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries, yet really adds\r\n      the value of ten pounds to the annual produce of the land and labour of\r\n      the society. While he has been consuming a half-yearly revenue of ten\r\n      pounds worth of corn and other necessaries, he has produced an equal value\r\n      of work, capable of purchasing, either to himself, or to some other\r\n      person, an equal half-yearly revenue. The value, therefore, of what has\r\n      been consumed and produced during these six months, is equal, not to ten,\r\n      but to twenty pounds. It is possible, indeed, that no more than ten pounds\r\n      worth of this value may ever have existed at any one moment of time. But\r\n      if the ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries which were consumed\r\n      by the artificer, had been consumed by a soldier, or by a menial servant,\r\n      the value of that part of the annual produce which existed at the end of\r\n      the six months, would have been ten pounds less than it actually is in\r\n      consequence of the labour of the artificer. Though the value of what the\r\n      artificer produces, therefore, should not, at any one moment of time, be\r\n      supposed greater than the value he consumes, yet, at every moment of time,\r\n      the actually existing value of goods in the market is, in consequence of\r\n      what he produces, greater than it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\n      When the patrons of this system assert, that the consumption of\r\n      artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, is equal to the value of what\r\n      they produce, they probably mean no more than that their revenue, or the\r\n      fund destined for their consumption, is equal to it. But if they had\r\n      expressed themselves more accurately, and only asserted, that the revenue\r\n      of this class was equal to the value of what they produced, it might\r\n      readily have occurred to the reader, that what would naturally be saved\r\n      out of this revenue, must necessarily increase more or less the real\r\n      wealth of the society. In order, therefore, to make out something like an\r\n      argument, it was necessary that they should express themselves as they\r\n      have done; and this argument, even supposing things actually were as it\r\n      seems to presume them to be, turns out to be a very inconclusive one.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, farmers and country labourers can no more augment, without\r\n      parsimony, the real revenue, the annual produce of the land and labour of\r\n      their society, than artificers, manufacturers, and merchants. The annual\r\n      produce of the land and labour of any society can be augmented only in two\r\n      ways; either, first, by some improvement in the productive powers of the\r\n      useful labour actually maintained within it; or, secondly, by some\r\n      increase in the quantity of that labour.\r\n\r\n      The improvement in the productive powers of useful labour depends, first,\r\n      upon the improvement in the ability of the workman; and, secondly, upon\r\n      that of the machinery with which he works. But the labour of artificers\r\n      and manufacturers, as it is capable of being more subdivided, and the\r\n      labour of each workman reduced to a greater simplicity of operation, than\r\n      that of farmers and country labourers; so it is likewise capable of both\r\n      these sorts of improvement in a much higher degree {See book i chap. 1.}\r\n      In this respect, therefore, the class of cultivators can have no sort of\r\n      advantage over that of artificers and manufacturers.\r\n\r\n      The increase in the quantity of useful labour actually employed within any\r\n      society must depend altogether upon the increase of the capital which\r\n      employs it; and the increase of that capital, again, must be exactly equal\r\n      to the amount of the savings from the revenue, either of the particular\r\n      persons who manage and direct the employment of that capital, or of some\r\n      other persons, who lend it to them. If merchants, artificers, and\r\n      manufacturers are, as this system seems to suppose, naturally more\r\n      inclined to parsimony and saving than proprietors and cultivators, they\r\n      are, so far, more likely to augment the quantity of useful labour employed\r\n      within their society, and consequently to increase its real revenue, the\r\n      annual produce of its land and labour.\r\n\r\n      Fifthly and lastly, though the revenue of the inhabitants of every country\r\n      was supposed to consist altogether, as this system seems to suppose, in\r\n      the quantity of subsistence which their industry could procure to them;\r\n      yet, even upon this supposition, the revenue of a trading and\r\n      manufacturing country must, other things being equal, always be much\r\n      greater than that of one without trade or manufactures. By means of trade\r\n      and manufactures, a greater quantity of subsistence can be annually\r\n      imported into a particular country, than what its own lands, in the actual\r\n      state of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of a town,\r\n      though they frequently possess no lands of their own, yet draw to\r\n      themselves, by their industry, such a quantity of the rude produce of the\r\n      lands of other people, as supplies them, not only with the materials of\r\n      their work, but with the fund of their subsistence. What a town always is\r\n      with regard to the country in its neighbourhood, one independent state or\r\n      country may frequently be with regard to other independent states or\r\n      countries. It is thus that Holland draws a great part of its subsistence\r\n      from other countries; live cattle from Holstein and Jutland, and corn from\r\n      almost all the different countries of Europe. A small quantity of\r\n      manufactured produce, purchases a great quantity of rude produce. A\r\n      trading and manufacturing country, therefore, naturally purchases, with a\r\n      small part of its manufactured produce, a great part of the rude produce\r\n      of other countries; while, on the contrary, a country without trade and\r\n      manufactures is generally obliged to purchase, at the expense of a great\r\n      part of its rude produce, a very small part of the manufactured produce of\r\n      other countries. The one exports what can subsist and accommodate but a\r\n      very few, and imports the subsistence and accommodation of a great number.\r\n      The other exports the accommodation and subsistence of a great number, and\r\n      imports that of a very few only. The inhabitants of the one must always\r\n      enjoy a much greater quantity of subsistence than what their own lands, in\r\n      the actual state of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of\r\n      the other must always enjoy a much smaller quantity.\r\n\r\n      This system, however, with all its imperfections, is perhaps the nearest\r\n      approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of\r\n      political economy; and is upon that account, well worth the consideration\r\n      of every man who wishes to examine with attention the principles of that\r\n      very important science. Though in representing the labour which is\r\n      employed upon land as the only productive labour, the notions which it\r\n      inculcates are, perhaps, too narrow and confined; yet in representing the\r\n      wealth of nations as consisting, not in the unconsumable riches of money,\r\n      but in the consumable goods annually reproduced by the labour of the\r\n      society, and in representing perfect liberty as the only effectual\r\n      expedient for rendering this annual reproduction the greatest possible,\r\n      its doctrine seems to be in every respect as just as it is generous and\r\n      liberal. Its followers are very numerous; and as men are fond of\r\n      paradoxes, and of appearing to understand what surpasses the\r\n      comprehensions of ordinary people, the paradox which it maintains,\r\n      concerning the unproductive nature of manufacturing labour, has not,\r\n      perhaps, contributed a little to increase the number of its admirers. They\r\n      have for some years past made a pretty considerable sect, distinguished in\r\n      the French republic of letters by the name of the Economists. Their works\r\n      have certainly been of some service to their country; not only by bringing\r\n      into general discussion, many subjects which had never been well examined\r\n      before, but by influencing, in some measure, the public administration in\r\n      favour of agriculture. It has been in consequence of their\r\n      representations, accordingly, that the agriculture of France has been\r\n      delivered from several of the oppressions which it before laboured under.\r\n      The term, during which such a lease can be granted, as will be valid\r\n      against every future purchaser or proprietor of the land, has been\r\n      prolonged from nine to twenty-seven years. The ancient provincial\r\n      restraints upon the transportation of corn from one province of the\r\n      kingdom to another, have been entirely taken away; and the liberty of\r\n      exporting it to all foreign countries, has been established as the common\r\n      law of the kingdom in all ordinary cases. This sect, in their works, which\r\n      are very numerous, and which treat not only of what is properly called\r\n      Political Economy, or of the nature and causes or the wealth of nations,\r\n      but of every other branch of the system of civil government, all follow\r\n      implicitly, and without any sensible variation, the doctrine of Mr\r\n      Qttesnai. There is, upon this account, little variety in the greater part\r\n      of their works. The most distinct and best connected account of this\r\n      doctrine is to be found in a little book written by Mr Mercier de la\r\n      Riviere, some time intendant of Martinico, entitled, The natural and\r\n      essential Order of Political Societies. The admiration of this whole sect\r\n      for their master, who was himself a man of the greatest modesty and\r\n      simplicity, is not inferior to that of any of the ancient philosophers for\r\n      the founders of their respective systems. ‘There have been since the world\r\n      began,’ says a very diligent and respectable author, the Marquis de\r\n      Mirabeau, ‘three great inventions which have principally given stability\r\n      to political societies, independent of many other inventions which have\r\n      enriched and adorned them. The first is the invention of writing, which\r\n      alone gives human nature the power of transmitting, without alteration,\r\n      its laws, its contracts, its annals, and its discoveries. The second is\r\n      the invention of money, which binds together all the relations between\r\n      civilized societies. The third is the economical table, the result of the\r\n      other two, which completes them both by perfecting their object; the great\r\n      discovery of our age, but of which our posterity will reap the benefit.’\r\n\r\n      As the political economy of the nations of modern Europe has been more\r\n      favourable to manufactures and foreign trade, the industry of the towns,\r\n      than to agriculture, the industry of the country; so that of other nations\r\n      has followed a different plan, and has been more favourable to agriculture\r\n      than to manufactures and foreign trade.\r\n\r\n      The policy of China favours agriculture more than all other employments.\r\n      In China, the condition of a labourer is said to be as much superior to\r\n      that of an artificer, as in most parts of Europe that of an artificer is\r\n      to that of a labourer. In China, the great ambition of every man is to get\r\n      possession of a little bit of land, either in property or in lease; and\r\n      leases are there said to be granted upon very moderate terms, and to be\r\n      sufficiently secured to the lessees. The Chinese have little respect for\r\n      foreign trade. Your beggarly commerce! was the language in which the\r\n      mandarins of Pekin used to talk to Mr De Lange, the Russian envoy,\r\n      concerning it {See the Journal of Mr De Lange, in Bell’s Travels, vol.\r\n      ii. p. 258, 276, 293.}. Except with Japan, the Chinese carry on,\r\n      themselves, and in their own bottoms, little or no foreign trade; and it\r\n      is only into one or two ports of their kingdom that they even admit the\r\n      ships of foreign nations. Foreign trade, therefore, is, in China, every\r\n      way confined within a much narrower circle than that to which it would\r\n      naturally extend itself, if more freedom was allowed to it, either in\r\n      their own ships, or in those of foreign nations.\r\n\r\n      Manufactures, as in a small bulk they frequently contain a great value,\r\n      and can upon that account be transported at less expense from one country\r\n      to another than most parts of rude produce, are, in almost all countries,\r\n      the principal support of foreign trade. In countries, besides, less\r\n      extensive, and less favourably circumstanced for inferior commerce than\r\n      China, they generally require the support of foreign trade. Without an\r\n      extensive foreign market, they could not well flourish, either in\r\n      countries so moderately extensive as to afford but a narrow home market,\r\n      or in countries where the communication between one province and another\r\n      was so difficult, as to render it impossible for the goods of any\r\n      particular place to enjoy the whole of that home market which the country\r\n      could afford. The perfection of manufacturing industry, it must be\r\n      remembered, depends altogether upon the division of labour; and the degree\r\n      to which the division of labour can be introduced into any manufacture, is\r\n      necessarily regulated, it has already been shewn, by the extent of the\r\n      market. But the great extent of the empire of China, the vast multitude of\r\n      its inhabitants, the variety of climate, and consequently of productions\r\n      in its different provinces, and the easy communication by means of\r\n      water-carriage between the greater part of them, render the home market of\r\n      that country of so great extent, as to be alone sufficient to support very\r\n      great manufactures, and to admit of very considerable subdivisions of\r\n      labour. The home market of China is, perhaps, in extent, not much inferior\r\n      to the market of all the different countries of Europe put together. A\r\n      more extensive foreign trade, however, which to this great home market\r\n      added the foreign market of all the rest of the world, especially if any\r\n      considerable part of this trade was carried on in Chinese ships, could\r\n      scarce fail to increase very much the manufactures of China, and to\r\n      improve very much the productive powers of its manufacturing industry. By\r\n      a more extensive navigation, the Chinese would naturally learn the art of\r\n      using and constructing, themselves, all the different machines made use of\r\n      in other countries, as well as the other improvements of art and industry\r\n      which are practised in all the different parts of the world. Upon their\r\n      present plan, they have little opportunity of improving themselves by the\r\n      example of any other nation, except that of the Japanese.\r\n\r\n      The policy of ancient Egypt, too, and that of the Gentoo government of\r\n      Indostan, seem to have favoured agriculture more than all other\r\n      employments.\r\n\r\n      Both in ancient Egypt and Indostan, the whole body of the people was\r\n      divided into different casts or tribes each of which was confined, from\r\n      father to son, to a particular employment, or class of employments. The\r\n      son of a priest was necessarily a priest; the son of a soldier, a soldier;\r\n      the son of a labourer, a labourer; the son of a weaver, a weaver; the son\r\n      of a tailor, a tailor, etc. In both countries, the cast of the priests\r\n      holds the highest rank, and that of the soldiers the next; and in both\r\n      countries the cast of the farmers and labourers was superior to the casts\r\n      of merchants and manufacturers.\r\n\r\n      The government of both countries was particularly attentive to the\r\n      interest of agriculture. The works constructed by the ancient sovereigns\r\n      of Egypt, for the proper distribution of the waters of the Nile, were\r\n      famous in antiquity, and the ruined remains of some of them are still the\r\n      admiration of travellers. Those of the same kind which were constructed by\r\n      the ancient sovereigns of Indostan, for the proper distribution of the\r\n      waters of the Ganges, as well as of many other rivers, though they have\r\n      been less celebrated, seem to have been equally great. Both countries,\r\n      accordingly, though subject occasionally to dearths, have been famous for\r\n      their great fertility. Though both were extremely populous, yet, in years\r\n      of moderate plenty, they were both able to export great quantities of\r\n      grain to their neighbours.\r\n\r\n      The ancient Egyptians had a superstitious aversion to the sea; and as the\r\n      Gentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire, nor\r\n      consequently to dress any victuals, upon the water, it, in effect,\r\n      prohibits them from all distant sea voyages. Both the Egyptians and\r\n      Indians must have depended almost altogether upon the navigation of other\r\n      nations for the exportation of their surplus produce; and this dependency,\r\n      as it must have confined the market, so it must have discouraged the\r\n      increase of this surplus produce. It must have discouraged, too, the\r\n      increase of the manufactured produce, more than that of the rude produce.\r\n      Manufactures require a much more extensive market than the most important\r\n      parts of the rude produce of the land. A single shoemaker will make more\r\n      than 300 pairs of shoes in the year; and his own family will not, perhaps,\r\n      wear out six pairs. Unless, therefore, he has the custom of, at least, 50\r\n      such families as his own, he cannot dispose of the whole product of his\r\n      own labour. The most numerous class of artificers will seldom, in a large\r\n      country, make more than one in 50, or one in a 100, of the whole number of\r\n      families contained in it. But in such large countries, as France and\r\n      England, the number of people employed in agriculture has, by some authors\r\n      been computed at a half, by others at a third and by no author that I know\r\n      of, at less that a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country. But as\r\n      the produce of the agriculture of both France and England is, the far\r\n      greater part of it, consumed at home, each person employed in it must,\r\n      according to these computations, require little more than the custom of\r\n      one, two, or, at most, of four such families as his own, in order to\r\n      dispose of the whole produce of his own labour. Agriculture, therefore,\r\n      can support itself under the discouragement of a confined market much\r\n      better than manufactures. In both ancient Egypt and Indostan, indeed, the\r\n      confinement of the foreign market was in some measure compensated by the\r\n      conveniency of many inland navigations, which opened, in the most\r\n      advantageous manner, the whole extent of the home market to every part of\r\n      the produce of every different district of those countries. The great\r\n      extent of Indostan, too, rendered the home market of that country very\r\n      great, and sufficient to support a great variety of manufactures. But the\r\n      small extent of ancient Egypt, which was never equal to England, must at\r\n      all times, have rendered the home market of that country too narrow for\r\n      supporting any great variety of manufactures. Bengal accordingly, the\r\n      province of Indostan which commonly exports the greatest quantity of rice,\r\n      has always been more remarkable for the exportation of a great variety of\r\n      manufactures, than for that of its grain. Ancient Egypt, on the contrary,\r\n      though it exported some manufactures, fine linen in particular, as well as\r\n      some other goods, was always most distinguished for its great exportation\r\n      of grain. It was long the granary of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n      The sovereigns of China, of ancient Egypt, and of the different kingdoms\r\n      into which Indostan has, at different times, been divided, have always\r\n      derived the whole, or by far the most considerable part, of their revenue,\r\n      from some sort of land tax or land rent. This land tax, or land rent, like\r\n      the tithe in Europe, consisted in a certain proportion, a fifth, it is\r\n      said, of the produce of the land, which was either delivered in kind, or\r\n      paid in money, according to a certain valuation, and which, therefore,\r\n      varied from year to year, according to all the variations of the produce.\r\n      It was natural, therefore, that the sovereigns of those countries should\r\n      be particularly attentive to the interests of agriculture, upon the\r\n      prosperity or declension of which immediately depended the yearly increase\r\n      or diminution of their own revenue.\r\n\r\n      The policy of the ancient republics of Greece, and that of Rome, though it\r\n      honoured agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade, yet seems\r\n      rather to have discouraged the latter employments, than to have given any\r\n      direct or intentional encouragement to the former. In several of the\r\n      ancient states of Greece, foreign trade was prohibited altogether; and in\r\n      several others, the employments of artificers and manufacturers were\r\n      considered as hurtful to the strength and agility of the human body, as\r\n      rendering it incapable of those habits which their military and gymnastic\r\n      exercises endeavoured to form in it, and as thereby disqualifying it, more\r\n      or less, for undergoing the fatigues and encountering the dangers of war.\r\n      Such occupations were considered as fit only for slaves, and the free\r\n      citizens of the states were prohibited from exercising them. Even in those\r\n      states where no such prohibition took place, as in Rome and Athens, the\r\n      great body of the people were in effect excluded from all the trades which\r\n      are now commonly exercised by the lower sort of the inhabitants of towns.\r\n      Such trades were, at Athens and Rome, all occupied by the slaves of the\r\n      rich, who exercised them for the benefit of their masters, whose wealth,\r\n      power, and protection, made it almost impossible for a poor freeman to\r\n      find a market for his work, when it came into competition with that of the\r\n      slaves of the rich. Slaves, however, are very seldom inventive; and all\r\n      the most important improvements, either in machinery, or in the\r\n      arrangement and distribution of work, which facilitate and abridge labour\r\n      have been the discoveries of freemen. Should a slave propose any\r\n      improvement of this kind, his master would be very apt to consider the\r\n      proposal as the suggestion of laziness, and of a desire to save his own\r\n      labour at the master’s expense. The poor slave, instead of reward would\r\n      probably meet with much abuse, perhaps with some punishment. In the\r\n      manufactures carried on by slaves, therefore, more labour must generally\r\n      have been employed to execute the same quantity of work, than in those\r\n      carried on by freemen. The work of the farmer must, upon that account,\r\n      generally have been dearer than that of the latter. The Hungarian mines,\r\n      it is remarked by Mr Montesquieu, though not richer, have always been\r\n      wrought with less expense, and therefore with more profit, than the\r\n      Turkish mines in their neighbourhood. The Turkish mines are wrought by\r\n      slaves; and the arms of those slaves are the only machines which the Turks\r\n      have ever thought of employing. The Hungarian mines are wrought by\r\n      freemen, who employ a great deal of machinery, by which they facilitate\r\n      and abridge their own labour. From the very little that is known about the\r\n      price of manufactures in the times of the Greeks and Romans, it would\r\n      appear that those of the finer sort were excessively dear. Silk sold for\r\n      its weight in gold. It was not, indeed, in those times an European\r\n      manufacture; and as it was all brought from the East Indies, the distance\r\n      of the carriage may in some measure account for the greatness of the\r\n      price. The price, however, which a lady, it is said, would sometimes pay\r\n      for a piece of very fine linen, seems to have been equally extravagant;\r\n      and as linen was always either an European, or at farthest, an Egyptian\r\n      manufacture, this high price can be accounted for only by the great\r\n      expense of the labour which must have been employed about It, and the\r\n      expense of this labour again could arise from nothing but the awkwardness\r\n      of the machinery which is made use of. The price of fine woollens, too,\r\n      though not quite so extravagant, seems, however, to have been much above\r\n      that of the present times. Some cloths, we are told by Pliny {Plin. 1.\r\n      ix.c.39.}, dyed in a particular manner, cost a hundred denarii, or\r\n      £3:6s:8d. the pound weight. Others, dyed in another manner, cost a\r\n      thousand denarii the pound weight, or £33:6s:8d. The Roman pound, it must\r\n      be remembered, contained only twelve of our avoirdupois ounces. This high\r\n      price, indeed, seems to have been principally owing to the dye. But had\r\n      not the cloths themselves been much dearer than any which are made in the\r\n      present times, so very expensive a dye would not probably have been\r\n      bestowed upon them. The disproportion would have been too great between\r\n      the value of the accessory and that of the principal. The price mentioned\r\n      by the same author {Plin. 1. viii.c.48.}, of some triclinaria, a sort of\r\n      woollen pillows or cushions made use of to lean upon as they reclined upon\r\n      their couches at table, passes all credibility; some of them being said to\r\n      have cost more than £30,000, others more than £300,000. This high price,\r\n      too, is not said to have arisen from the dye. In the dress of the people\r\n      of fashion of both sexes, there seems to have been much less variety, it\r\n      is observed by Dr Arbuthnot, in ancient than in modern times; and the\r\n      very little variety which we find in that of the ancient statues, confirms\r\n      his observation. He infers from this, that their dress must, upon the\r\n      whole, have been cheaper than ours; but the conclusion does not seem to\r\n      follow. When the expense of fashionable dress is very great, the variety\r\n      must be very small. But when, by the improvements in the productive powers\r\n      of manufacturing art and industry, the expense of any one dress comes to\r\n      be very moderate, the variety will naturally be very great. The rich, not\r\n      being able to distinguish themselves by the expense of any one dress, will\r\n      naturally endeavour to do so by the multitude and variety of their\r\n      dresses.\r\n\r\n      The greatest and most important branch of the commerce of every nation, it\r\n      has already been observed, is that which is carried on between the\r\n      inhabitants of the town and those of the country. The inhabitants of the\r\n      town draw from the country the rude produce, which constitutes both the\r\n      materials of their work and the fund of their subsistence; and they pay\r\n      for this rude produce, by sending back to the country a certain portion of\r\n      it manufactured and prepared for immediate use. The trade which is carried\r\n      on between these two different sets of people, consists ultimately in a\r\n      certain quantity of rude produce exchanged for a certain quantity of\r\n      manufactured produce. The dearer the latter, therefore, the cheaper the\r\n      former; and whatever tends in any country to raise the price of\r\n      manufactured produce, tends to lower that of the rude produce of the land,\r\n      and thereby to discourage agriculture. The smaller the quantity of\r\n      manufactured produce, which any given quantity of rude produce, or, what\r\n      comes to the same thing, which the price of any given quantity of rude\r\n      produce, is capable of purchasing, the smaller the exchangeable value of\r\n      that given quantity of rude produce; the smaller the encouragement which\r\n      either the landlord has to increase its quantity by improving, or the\r\n      farmer by cultivating the land. Whatever, besides, tends to diminish in\r\n      any country the number of artificers and manufacturers, tends to diminish\r\n      the home market, the most important of all markets, for the rude produce\r\n      of the land, and thereby still further to discourage agriculture.\r\n\r\n      Those systems, therefore, which preferring agriculture to all other\r\n      employments, in order to promote it, impose restraints upon manufactures\r\n      and foreign trade, act contrary to the very end which they propose, and\r\n      indirectly discourage that very species of industry which they mean to\r\n      promote. They are so far, perhaps, more inconsistent than even the\r\n      mercantile system. That system, by encouraging manufactures and foreign\r\n      trade more than agriculture, turns a certain portion of the capital of the\r\n      society, from supporting a more advantageous, to support a less\r\n      advantageous species of industry. But still it really, and in the end,\r\n      encourages that species of industry which it means to promote. Those\r\n      agricultural systems, on the contrary, really, and in the end, discourage\r\n      their own favourite species of industry.\r\n\r\n      It is thus that every system which endeavours, either, by extraordinary\r\n      encouragements to draw towards a particular species of industry a greater\r\n      share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it,\r\n      or, by extraordinary restraints, to force from a particular species of\r\n      industry some share of the capital which would otherwise be employed in\r\n      it, is, in reality, subversive of the great purpose which it means to\r\n      promote. It retards, instead of accelerating the progress of the society\r\n      towards real wealth and greatness; and diminishes, instead of increasing,\r\n      the real value of the annual produce of its land and labour.\r\n\r\n      All systems, either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus\r\n      completely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty\r\n      establishes itself of its own accord. Every man, as long as he does not\r\n      violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own\r\n      interest his own way, and to bring both his industry and capital into\r\n      competition with those of any other man, or order of men. The sovereign is\r\n      completely discharged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which he\r\n      must always be exposed to innumerable delusions, and for the proper\r\n      performance of which, no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be\r\n      sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and\r\n      of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interests of\r\n      the society. According to the system of natural liberty, the sovereign has\r\n      only three duties to attend to; three duties of great importance, indeed,\r\n      but plain and intelligible to common understandings: first, the duty of\r\n      protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent\r\n      societies; secondly, the duty of protecting, as far as possible, every\r\n      member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other\r\n      member of it, or the duty of establishing an exact administration of\r\n      justice; and, thirdly, the duty of erecting and maintaining certain public\r\n      works, and certain public institutions, which it can never be for the\r\n      interest of any individual, or small number of individuals to erect and\r\n      maintain; because the profit could never repay the expense to any\r\n      individual, or small number of individuals, though it may frequently do\r\n      much more than repay it to a great society.\r\n\r\n      The proper performance of those several duties of the sovereign\r\n      necessarily supposes a certain expense; and this expense again necessarily\r\n      requires a certain revenue to support it. In the following book,\r\n      therefore, I shall endeavour to explain, first, what are the necessary\r\n      expenses of the sovereign or commonwealth; and which of those expenses\r\n      ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society; and\r\n      which of them, by that of some particular part only, or of some particular\r\n      members of the society: secondly, what are the different methods in which\r\n      the whole society may be made to contribute towards defraying the expenses\r\n      incumbent on the whole society; and what are the principal advantages and\r\n      inconveniencies of each of those methods: and thirdly, what are the\r\n      reasons and causes which have induced almost all modern governments to\r\n      mortgage some part of this revenue, or to contract debts; and what have\r\n      been the effects of those debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce\r\n      of the land and labour of the society. The following book, therefore, will\r\n      naturally be divided into three chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      APPENDIX TO BOOK IV\r\n\r\n      The two following accounts are subjoined, in order to illustrate and\r\n      confirm what is said in the fifth chapter of the fourth book, concerning\r\n      the Tonnage Bounty to the Whit-herring Fishery. The reader, I believe, may\r\n      depend upon the accuracy of both accounts.\r\n\r\n      An account of Busses fitted out in Scotland for eleven Years, with the\r\n      Number of empty Barrels carried out, and the Number of Barrels of Herrings\r\n      caught;

Of the Expense of Defence.\r\n\r\n      The first duty of the sovereign, that of protecting the society from the\r\n      violence and invasion of other independent societies, can be performed\r\n      only by means of a military force. But the expense both of preparing this\r\n      military force in time of peace, and of employing it in time of war, is\r\n      very different in the different states of society, in the different\r\n      periods of improvement.\r\n\r\n      Among nations of hunters, the lowest and rudest state of society, such as\r\n      we find it among the native tribes of North America, every man is a\r\n      warrior, as well as a hunter. When he goes to war, either to defend his\r\n      society, or to revenge the injuries which have been done to it by other\r\n      societies, he maintains himself by his own labour, in the same manner as\r\n      when he lives at home. His society (for in this state of things there is\r\n      properly neither sovereign nor commonwealth) is at no sort of expense,\r\n      either to prepare him for the field, or to maintain him while he is in it.\r\n\r\n      Among nations of shepherds, a more advanced state of society, such as we\r\n      find it among the Tartars and Arabs, every man is, in the same manner, a\r\n      warrior. Such nations have commonly no fixed habitation, but live either\r\n      in tents, or in a sort of covered waggons, which are easily transported\r\n      from place to place. The whole tribe, or nation, changes its situation\r\n      according to the different seasons of the year, as well as according to\r\n      other accidents. When its herds and flocks have consumed the forage of one\r\n      part of the country, it removes to another, and from that to a third. In\r\n      the dry season, it comes down to the banks of the rivers; in the wet\r\n      season, it retires to the upper country. When such a nation goes to war,\r\n      the warriors will not trust their herds and flocks to the feeble defence\r\n      of their old men, their women and children; and their old men, their women\r\n      and children, will not be left behind without defence, and without\r\n      subsistence. The whole nation, besides, being accustomed to a wandering\r\n      life, even in time of peace, easily takes the field in time of war.\r\n      Whether it marches as an army, or moves about as a company of herdsmen,\r\n      the way of life is nearly the same, though the object proposed by it be\r\n      very different. They all go to war together, therefore, and everyone does\r\n      as well as he can. Among the Tartars, even the women have been frequently\r\n      known to engage in battle. If they conquer, whatever belongs to the\r\n      hostile tribe is the recompence of the victory; but if they are\r\n      vanquished, all is lost; and not only their herds and flocks, but their\r\n      women and children become the booty of the conqueror. Even the greater\r\n      part of those who survive the action are obliged to submit to him for the\r\n      sake of immediate subsistence. The rest are commonly dissipated and\r\n      dispersed in the desert.\r\n\r\n      The ordinary life, the ordinary exercise of a Tartar or Arab, prepares him\r\n      sufficiently for war. Running, wrestling, cudgel-playing, throwing the\r\n      javelin, drawing the bow, etc. are the common pastimes of those who live\r\n      in the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a Tartar or\r\n      Arab actually goes to war, he is maintained by his own herds and flocks,\r\n      which he carries with him, in the same manner as in peace. His chief or\r\n      sovereign (for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns) is at no sort\r\n      of expense in preparing him for the field; and when he is in it, the\r\n      chance of plunder is the only pay which he either expects or requires.\r\n\r\n      An army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men. The\r\n      precarious subsistence which the chace affords, could seldom allow a\r\n      greater number to keep together for any considerable time. An army of\r\n      shepherds, on the contrary, may sometimes amount to two or three hundred\r\n      thousand. As long as nothing stops their progress, as long as they can go\r\n      on from one district, of which they have consumed the forage, to another,\r\n      which is yet entire; there seems to be scarce any limit to the number who\r\n      can march on together. A nation of hunters can never be formidable to the\r\n      civilized nations in their neighbourhood; a nation of shepherds may.\r\n      Nothing can be more contemptible than an Indian war in North America;\r\n      nothing, on the contrary, can be more dreadful than a Tartar invasion has\r\n      frequently been in Asia. The judgment of Thucydides, that both Europe and\r\n      Asia could not resist the Scythians united, has been verified by the\r\n      experience of all ages. The inhabitants of the extensive, but defenceless\r\n      plains of Scythia or Tartary, have been frequently united under the\r\n      dominion of the chief of some conquering horde or clan; and the havock and\r\n      devastation of Asia have always signalized their union. The inhabitants of\r\n      the inhospitable deserts of Arabia, the other great nation of shepherds,\r\n      have never been united but once, under Mahomet and his immediate\r\n      successors. Their union, which was more the effect of religious enthusiasm\r\n      than of conquest, was signalized in the same manner. If the hunting\r\n      nations of America should ever become shepherds, their neighbourhood would\r\n      be much more dangerous to the European colonies than it is at present.\r\n\r\n      In a yet more advanced state of society, among those nations of husbandmen\r\n      who have little foreign commerce, and no other manufactures but those\r\n      coarse and household ones, which almost every private family prepares for\r\n      its own use, every man, in the same manner, either is a warrior, or easily\r\n      becomes such. Those who live by agriculture generally pass the whole day\r\n      in the open air, exposed to all the inclemencies of the seasons. The\r\n      hardiness of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues of war, to\r\n      some of which their necessary occupations bear a great analogy. The\r\n      necessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the trenches,\r\n      and to fortify a camp, as well as to inclose a field. The ordinary\r\n      pastimes of such husbandmen are the same as those of shepherds, and are in\r\n      the same manner the images of war. But as husbandmen have less leisure\r\n      than shepherds, they are not so frequently employed in those pastimes.\r\n      They are soldiers but soldiers not quite so much masters of their\r\n      exercise. Such as they are, however, it seldom costs the sovereign or\r\n      commonwealth any expense to prepare them for the field.\r\n\r\n      Agriculture, even in its rudest and lowest state, supposes a settlement,\r\n      some sort of fixed habitation, which cannot be abandoned without great\r\n      loss. When a nation of mere husbandmen, therefore, goes to war, the whole\r\n      people cannot take the field together. The old men, the women and\r\n      children, at least, must remain at home, to take care of the habitation.\r\n      All the men of the military age, however, may take the field, and in small\r\n      nations of this kind, have frequently done so. In every nation, the men of\r\n      the military age are supposed to amount to about a fourth or a fifth part\r\n      of the whole body of the people. If the campaign, too, should begin after\r\n      seedtime, and end before harvest, both the husbandman and his principal\r\n      labourers can be spared from the farm without much loss. He trusts that\r\n      the work which must be done in the mean time, can be well enough executed\r\n      by the old men, the women, and the children. He is not unwilling,\r\n      therefore, to serve without pay during a short campaign; and it frequently\r\n      costs the sovereign or commonwealth as little to maintain him in the field\r\n      as to prepare him for it. The citizens of all the different states of\r\n      ancient Greece seem to have served in this manner till after the second\r\n      Persian war; and the people of Peloponnesus till after the Peloponnesian\r\n      war. The Peloponnesians, Thucydides observes, generally left the field in\r\n      the summer, and returned home to reap the harvest. The Roman people, under\r\n      their kings, and during the first ages of the republic, served in the same\r\n      manner. It was not till the seige of Veii, that they who staid at home\r\n      began to contribute something towards maintaining those who went to war.\r\n      In the European monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman\r\n      empire, both before, and for some time after, the establishment of what is\r\n      properly called the feudal law, the great lords, with all their immediate\r\n      dependents, used to serve the crown at their own expense. In the field, in\r\n      the same manner as at home, they maintained themselves by their own\r\n      revenue, and not by any stipend or pay which they received from the king\r\n      upon that particular occasion.\r\n\r\n      In a more advanced state of society, two different causes contribute to\r\n      render it altogether impossible that they who take the field should\r\n      maintain themselves at their own expense. Those two causes are, the\r\n      progress of manufactures, and the improvement in the art of war.\r\n\r\n      Though a husbandman should be employed in an expedition, provided it\r\n      begins after seedtime, and ends before harvest, the interruption of his\r\n      business will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his\r\n      revenue. Without the intervention of his labour, Nature does herself the\r\n      greater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment that an\r\n      artificer, a smith, a carpenter, or a weaver, for example, quits his\r\n      workhouse, the sole source of his revenue is completely dried up. Nature\r\n      does nothing for him; he does all for himself. When he takes the field,\r\n      therefore, in defence of the public, as he has no revenue to maintain\r\n      himself, he must necessarily be maintained by the public. But in a\r\n      country, of which a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and\r\n      manufacturers, a great part of the people who go to war must be drawn from\r\n      those classes, and must, therefore, be maintained by the public as long as\r\n      they are employed in its service.\r\n\r\n      When the art of war, too, has gradually grown up to be a very intricate\r\n      and complicated science; when the event of war ceases to be determined, as\r\n      in the first ages of society, by a single irregular skirmish or battle;\r\n      but when the contest is generally spun out through several different\r\n      campaigns, each of which lasts during the greater part of the year; it\r\n      becomes universally necessary that the public should maintain those who\r\n      serve the public in war, at least while they are employed in that service.\r\n      Whatever, in time of peace, might be the ordinary occupation of those who\r\n      go to war, so very tedious and expensive a service would otherwise be by\r\n      far too heavy a burden upon them. After the second Persian war,\r\n      accordingly, the armies of Athens seem to have been generally composed of\r\n      mercenary troops, consisting, indeed, partly of citizens, but partly, too,\r\n      of foreigners; and all of them equally hired and paid at the expense of\r\n      the state. From the time of the siege of Veii, the armies of Rome received\r\n      pay for their service during the time which they remained in the field.\r\n      Under the feudal governments, the military service, both of the great\r\n      lords, and of their immediate dependents, was, after a certain period,\r\n      universally exchanged for a payment in money, which was employed to\r\n      maintain those who served in their stead.\r\n\r\n      The number of those who can go to war, in proportion to the whole number\r\n      of the people, is necessarily much smaller in a civilized than in a rude\r\n      state of society. In a civilized society, as the soldiers are maintained\r\n      altogether by the labour of those who are not soldiers, the number of the\r\n      former can never exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above\r\n      maintaining, in a manner suitable to their respective stations, both\r\n      themselves and the other officers of government and law, whom they are\r\n      obliged to maintain. In the little agrarian states of ancient Greece, a\r\n      fourth or a fifth part of the whole body of the people considered the\r\n      themselves as soldiers, and would sometimes, it is said, take the field.\r\n      Among the civilized nations of modern Europe, it is commonly computed,\r\n      that not more than the one hundredth part of the inhabitants of any\r\n      country can be employed as soldiers, without ruin to the country which\r\n      pays the expense of their service.\r\n\r\n      The expense of preparing the army for the field seems not to have become\r\n      considerable in any nation, till long after that of maintaining it in the\r\n      field had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or commonwealth. In all the\r\n      different republics of ancient Greece, to learn his military exercises,\r\n      was a necessary part of education imposed by the state upon every free\r\n      citizen. In every city there seems to have been a public field, in which,\r\n      under the protection of the public magistrate, the young people were\r\n      taught their different exercises by different masters. In this very simple\r\n      institution consisted the whole expense which any Grecian state seems ever\r\n      to have been at, in preparing its citizens for war. In ancient Rome, the\r\n      exercises of the Campus Martius answered the same purpose with those of\r\n      the Gymnasium in ancient Greece. Under the feudal governments, the many\r\n      public ordinances, that the citizens of every district should practise\r\n      archery, as well as several other military exercises, were intended for\r\n      promoting the same purpose, but do not seem to have promoted it so well.\r\n      Either from want of interest in the officers entrusted with the execution\r\n      of those ordinances, or from some other cause, they appear to have been\r\n      universally neglected; and in the progress of all those governments,\r\n      military exercises seem to have gone gradually into disuse among the great\r\n      body of the people.\r\n\r\n      In the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, during the whole period of\r\n      their existence, and under the feudal governments, for a considerable time\r\n      after their first establishment, the trade of a soldier was not a\r\n      separate, distinct trade, which constituted the sole or principal\r\n      occupation of a particular class of citizens; every subject of the state,\r\n      whatever might be the ordinary trade or occupation by which he gained his\r\n      livelihood, considered himself, upon all ordinary occasions, as fit\r\n      likewise to exercise the trade of a soldier, and, upon many extraordinary\r\n      occasions, as bound to exercise it.\r\n\r\n      The art of war, however, as it is certainly the noblest of all arts, so,\r\n      in the progress of improvement, it necessarily becomes one of the most\r\n      complicated among them. The state of the mechanical, as well as some other\r\n      arts, with which it is necessarily connected, determines the degree of\r\n      perfection to which it is capable of being carried at any particular time.\r\n      But in order to carry it to this degree of perfection, it is necessary\r\n      that it should become the sole or principal occupation of a particular\r\n      class of citizens; and the division of labour is as necessary for the\r\n      improvement of this, as of every other art. Into other arts, the division\r\n      of labour is naturally introduced by the prudence of individuals, who find\r\n      that they promote their private interest better by confining themselves to\r\n      a particular trade, than by exercising a great number. But it is the\r\n      wisdom of the state only, which can render the trade of a soldier a\r\n      particular trade, separate and distinct from all others. A private\r\n      citizen, who, in time of profound peace, and without any particular\r\n      encouragement from the public, should spend the greater part of his time\r\n      in military exercises, might, no doubt, both improve himself very much in\r\n      them, and amuse himself very well; but he certainly would not promote his\r\n      own interest. It is the wisdom of the state only, which can render it for\r\n      his interest to give up the greater part of his time to this peculiar\r\n      occupation; and states have not always had this wisdom, even when their\r\n      circumstances had become such, that the preservation of their existence\r\n      required that they should have it.\r\n\r\n      A shepherd has a great deal of leisure; a husbandman, in the rude state of\r\n      husbandry, has some; an artificer or manufacturer has none at all. The\r\n      first may, without any loss, employ a great deal of his time in martial\r\n      exercises; the second may employ some part of it; but the last cannot\r\n      employ a single hour in them without some loss, and his attention to his\r\n      own interest naturally leads him to neglect them altogether. Those\r\n      improvements in husbandry, too, which the progress of arts and\r\n      manufactures necessarily introduces, leave the husbandman as little\r\n      leisure as the artificer. Military exercises come to be as much neglected\r\n      by the inhabitants of the country as by those of the town, and the great\r\n      body of the people becomes altogether unwarlike. That wealth, at the same\r\n      time, which always follows the improvements of agriculture and\r\n      manufactures, and which, in reality, is no more than the accumulated\r\n      produce of those improvements, provokes the invasion of all their\r\n      neighbours. An industrious, and, upon that account, a wealthy nation, is\r\n      of all nations the most likely to be attacked; and unless the state takes\r\n      some new measure for the public defence, the natural habits of the people\r\n      render them altogether incapable of defending themselves.\r\n\r\n      In these circumstances, there seem to be but two methods by which the\r\n      state can make any tolerable provision for the public defence.\r\n\r\n      It may either, first, by means of a very rigorous police, and in spite of\r\n      the whole bent of the interest, genius, and inclinations of the people,\r\n      enforce the practice of military exercises, and oblige either all the\r\n      citizens of the military age, or a certain number of them, to join in some\r\n      measure the trade of a soldier to whatever other trade or profession they\r\n      may happen to carry on.\r\n\r\n      Or, secondly, by maintaining and employing a certain number of citizens in\r\n      the constant practice of military exercises, it may render the trade of a\r\n      soldier a particular trade, separate and distinct from all others.\r\n\r\n      If the state has recourse to the first of those two expedients, its\r\n      military force is said to consist in a militia; if to the second, it is\r\n      said to consist in a standing army. The practice of military exercises is\r\n      the sole or principal occupation of the soldiers of a standing army, and\r\n      the maintenance or pay which the state affords them is the principal and\r\n      ordinary fund of their subsistence. The practice of military exercises is\r\n      only the occasional occupation of the soldiers of a militia, and they\r\n      derive the principal and ordinary fund of their subsistence from some\r\n      other occupation. In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer,\r\n      or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier; in a standing army,\r\n      that of the soldier predominates over every other character; and in this\r\n      distinction seems to consist the essential difference between those two\r\n      different species of military force.\r\n\r\n      Militias have been of several different kinds. In some countries, the\r\n      citizens destined for defending the state seem to have been exercised\r\n      only, without being, if I may say so, regimented; that is, without being\r\n      divided into separate and distinct bodies of troops, each of which\r\n      performed its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers. In\r\n      the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, each citizen, as long as he\r\n      remained at home, seems to have practised his exercises, either separately\r\n      and independently, or with such of his equals as he liked best; and not to\r\n      have been attached to any particular body of troops, till he was actually\r\n      called upon to take the field. In other countries, the militia has not\r\n      only been exercised, but regimented. In England, in Switzerland, and, I\r\n      believe, in every other country of modern Europe, where any imperfect\r\n      military force of this kind has been established, every militiaman is,\r\n      even in time of peace, attached to a particular body of troops, which\r\n      performs its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers.\r\n\r\n      Before the invention of fire-arms, that army was superior in which the\r\n      soldiers had, each individually, the greatest skill and dexterity in the\r\n      use of their arms. Strength and agility of body were of the highest\r\n      consequence, and commonly determined the fate of battles. But this skill\r\n      and dexterity in the use of their arms could be acquired only, in the same\r\n      manner as fencing is at present, by practising, not in great bodies, but\r\n      each man separately, in a particular school, under a particular master, or\r\n      with his own particular equals and companions. Since the invention of\r\n      fire-arms, strength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity\r\n      and skill in the use of arms, though they are far from being of no\r\n      consequence, are, however, of less consequence. The nature of the weapon,\r\n      though it by no means puts the awkward upon a level with the skilful, puts\r\n      him more nearly so than he ever was before. All the dexterity and skill,\r\n      it is supposed, which are necessary for using it, can be well enough\r\n      acquired by practising in great bodies.\r\n\r\n      Regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, are qualities which,\r\n      in modern armies, are of more importance towards determining the fate of\r\n      battles, than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of their\r\n      arms. But the noise of fire-arms, the smoke, and the invisible death to\r\n      which every man feels himself every moment exposed, as soon as he comes\r\n      within cannon-shot, and frequently a long time before the battle can be\r\n      well said to be engaged, must render it very difficult to maintain any\r\n      considerable degree of this regularity, order, and prompt obedience, even\r\n      in the beginning of a modern battle. In an ancient battle, there was no\r\n      noise but what arose from the human voice; there was no smoke, there was\r\n      no invisible cause of wounds or death. Every man, till some mortal weapon\r\n      actually did approach him, saw clearly that no such weapon was near him.\r\n      In these circumstances, and among troops who had some confidence in their\r\n      own skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, it must have been a good\r\n      deal less difficult to preserve some degree of regularity and order, not\r\n      only in the beginning, but through the whole progress of an ancient\r\n      battle, and till one of the two armies was fairly defeated. But the habits\r\n      of regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, can be acquired\r\n      only by troops which are exercised in great bodies.\r\n\r\n      A militia, however, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined or\r\n      exercised, must always be much inferior to a well disciplined and well\r\n      exercised standing army.\r\n\r\n      The soldiers who are exercised only once a week, or once a-month, can\r\n      never be so expert in the use of their arms, as those who are exercised\r\n      every day, or every other day; and though this circumstance may not be of\r\n      so much consequence in modern, as it was in ancient times, yet the\r\n      acknowledged superiority of the Prussian troops, owing, it is said, very\r\n      much to their superior expertness in their exercise, may satisfy us that\r\n      it is, even at this day, of very considerable consequence.\r\n\r\n      The soldiers, who are bound to obey their officer only once a-week, or\r\n      once a-month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their\r\n      own affairs their own way, without being, in any respect, accountable to\r\n      him, can never be under the same awe in his presence, can never have the\r\n      same disposition to ready obedience, with those whose whole life and\r\n      conduct are every day directed by him, and who every day even rise and go\r\n      to bed, or at least retire to their quarters, according to his orders. In\r\n      what is called discipline, or in the habit of ready obedience, a militia\r\n      must always be still more inferior to a standing army, than it may\r\n      sometimes be in what is called the manual exercise, or in the management\r\n      and use of its arms. But, in modern war, the habit of ready and instant\r\n      obedience is of much greater consequence than a considerable superiority\r\n      in the management of arms.\r\n\r\n      Those militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war under the\r\n      same chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace, are by far the\r\n      best. In respect for their officers, in the habit of ready obedience, they\r\n      approach nearest to standing armies. The Highland militia, when it served\r\n      under its own chieftains, had some advantage of the same kind. As the\r\n      Highlanders, however, were not wandering, but stationary shepherds, as\r\n      they had all a fixed habitation, and were not, in peaceable times,\r\n      accustomed to follow their chieftain from place to place; so, in time of\r\n      war, they were less willing to follow him to any considerable distance, or\r\n      to continue for any long time in the field. When they had acquired any\r\n      booty, they were eager to return home, and his authority was seldom\r\n      sufficient to detain them. In point of obedience, they were always much\r\n      inferior to what is reported of the Tartars and Arabs. As the Highlanders,\r\n      too, from their stationary life, spend less of their time in the open air,\r\n      they were always less accustomed to military exercises, and were less\r\n      expert in the use of their arms than the Tartars and Arabs are said to be.\r\n\r\n      A militia of any kind, it must be observed, however, which has served for\r\n      several successive campaigns in the field, becomes in every respect a\r\n      standing army. The soldiers are every day exercised in the use of their\r\n      arms, and, being constantly under the command of their officers, are\r\n      habituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place in standing\r\n      armies. What they were before they took the field, is of little\r\n      importance. They necessarily become in every respect a standing army,\r\n      after they have passed a few campaigns in it. Should the war in America\r\n      drag out through another campaign, the American militia may become, in\r\n      every respect, a match for that standing army, of which the valour\r\n      appeared, in the last war at least, not inferior to that of the hardiest\r\n      veterans of France and Spain.\r\n\r\n      This distinction being well understood, the history of all ages, it will\r\n      be found, hears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a well\r\n      regulated standing army has over a militia.\r\n\r\n      One of the first standing armies, of which we have any distinct account in\r\n      any well authenticated history, is that of Philip of Macedon. His frequent\r\n      wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some of the Greek\r\n      cities in the neighbourhood of Macedon, gradually formed his troops, which\r\n      in the beginning were probably militia, to the exact discipline of a\r\n      standing army. When he was at peace, which he was very seldom, and never\r\n      for any long time together, he was careful not to disband that army. It\r\n      vanquished and subdued, after a long and violent struggle, indeed, the\r\n      gallant and well exercised militias of the principal republics of ancient\r\n      Greece; and afterwards, with very little struggle, the effeminate and ill\r\n      exercised militia of the great Persian empire. The fall of the Greek\r\n      republics, and of the Persian empire was the effect of the irresistible\r\n      superiority which a standing arm has over every other sort of militia. It\r\n      is the first great revolution in the affairs of mankind of which history\r\n      has preserved any distinct and circumstantial account.\r\n\r\n      The fall of Carthage, and the consequent elevation of Rome, is the second.\r\n      All the varieties in the fortune of those two famous republics may very\r\n      well be accounted for from the same cause.\r\n\r\n      From the end of the first to the beginning of the second Carthaginian war,\r\n      the armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed under\r\n      three great generals, who succeeded one another in the command; Amilcar,\r\n      his son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Annibal: first in chastising their\r\n      own rebellious slaves, afterwards in subduing the revolted nations of\r\n      Africa; and lastly, in conquering the great kingdom of Spain. The army\r\n      which Annibal led from Spain into Italy must necessarily, in those\r\n      different wars, have been gradually formed to the exact discipline of a\r\n      standing army. The Romans, in the meantime, though they had not been\r\n      altogether at peace, yet they had not, during this period, been engaged in\r\n      any war of very great consequence; and their military discipline, it is\r\n      generally said, was a good deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Annibal\r\n      encountered at Trebi, Thrasymenus, and Cannae, were militia opposed to a\r\n      standing army. This circumstance, it is probable, contributed more than\r\n      any other to determine the fate of those battles.\r\n\r\n      The standing army which Annibal left behind him in Spain had the like\r\n      superiority over the militia which the Romans sent to oppose it; and, in a\r\n      few years, under the command of his brother, the younger Asdrubal,\r\n      expelled them almost entirely from that country.\r\n\r\n      Annibal was ill supplied from home. The Roman militia, being continually\r\n      in the field, became, in the progress of the war, a well disciplined and\r\n      well exercised standing army; and the superiority of Annibal grew every\r\n      day less and less. Asdrubal judged it necessary to lead the whole, or\r\n      almost the whole, of the standing army which he commanded in Spain, to the\r\n      assistance of his brother in Italy. In this march, he is said to have been\r\n      misled by his guides; and in a country which he did not know, was\r\n      surprised and attacked, by another standing army, in every respect equal\r\n      or superior to his own, and was entirely defeated.\r\n\r\n      When Asdrubal had left Spain, the great Scipio found nothing to oppose him\r\n      but a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and subdued that militia,\r\n      and, in the course of the war, his own militia necessarily became a well\r\n      disciplined and well exercised standing army. That standing army was\r\n      afterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing but a militia to\r\n      oppose it. In order to defend Carthage, it became necessary to recal the\r\n      standing army of Annibal. The disheartened and frequently defeated African\r\n      militia joined it, and, at the battle of Zama, composed the greater part\r\n      of the troops of Annibal. The event of that day determined the fate of the\r\n      two rival republics.\r\n\r\n      From the end of the second Carthaginian war till the fall of the Roman\r\n      republic, the armies of Rome were in every respect standing armies. The\r\n      standing army of Macedon made some resistance to their arms. In the height\r\n      of their grandeur, it cost them two great wars, and three great battles,\r\n      to subdue that little kingdom, of which the conquest would probably have\r\n      been still more difficult, had it not been for the cowardice of its last\r\n      king. The militias of all the civilized nations of the ancient world, of\r\n      Greece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble resistance to the\r\n      standing armies of Rome. The militias of some barbarous nations defended\r\n      themselves much better. The Scythian or Tartar militia, which Mithridates\r\n      drew from the countries north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, were the\r\n      most formidable enemies whom the Romans had to encounter after the second\r\n      Carthaginian war. The Parthian and German militias, too, were always\r\n      respectable, and upon several occasions, gained very considerable\r\n      advantages over the Roman armies. In general, however, and when the Roman\r\n      armies were well commanded, they appear to have been very much superior;\r\n      and if the Romans did not pursue the final conquest either of Parthia or\r\n      Germany, it was probably because they judged that it was not worth while\r\n      to add those two barbarous countries to an empire which was already too\r\n      large. The ancient Parthians appear to have been a nation of Scythian or\r\n      Tartar extraction, and to have always retained a good deal of the manners\r\n      of their ancestors. The ancient Germans were, like the Scythians or\r\n      Tartars, a nation of wandering shepherds, who went to war under the same\r\n      chiefs whom they were accustomed to follow in peace. ‘Their militia was\r\n      exactly of the same kind with that of the Scythians or Tartars, from whom,\r\n      too, they were probably descended.’\r\n\r\n      Many different causes contributed to relax the discipline of the Roman\r\n      armies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the\r\n      days of their grandeur, when no enemy appeared capable of opposing them,\r\n      their heavy armour was laid aside as unnecessarily burdensome, their\r\n      laborious exercises were neglected, as unnecessarily toilsome. Under the\r\n      Roman emperors, besides, the standing armies of Rome, those particularly\r\n      which guarded the German and Pannonian frontiers, became dangerous to\r\n      their masters, against whom they used frequently to set up their own\r\n      generals. In order to render them less formidable, according to some\r\n      authors, Dioclesian, according to others, Constantine, first withdrew them\r\n      from the frontier, where they had always before been encamped in great\r\n      bodies, generally of two or three legions each, and dispersed them in\r\n      small bodies through the different provincial towns, from whence they were\r\n      scarce ever removed, but when it became necessary to repel an invasion.\r\n      Small bodies of soldiers, quartered in trading and manufacturing towns,\r\n      and seldom removed from those quarters, became themselves trades men,\r\n      artificers, and manufacturers. The civil came to predominate over the\r\n      military character; and the standing armies of Rome gradually degenerated\r\n      into a corrupt, neglected, and undisciplined militia, incapable of\r\n      resisting the attack of the German and Scythian militias, which soon\r\n      afterwards invaded the western empire. It was only by hiring the militia\r\n      of some of those nations to oppose to that of others, that the emperors\r\n      were for some time able to defend themselves. The fall of the western\r\n      empire is the third great revolution in the affairs of mankind, of which\r\n      ancient history has preserved any distinct or circumstantial account. It\r\n      was brought about by the irresistible superiority which the militia of a\r\n      barbarous has over that of a civilized nation; which the militia of a\r\n      nation of shepherds has over that of a nation of husbandmen, artificers,\r\n      and manufacturers. The victories which have been gained by militias have\r\n      generally been, not over standing armies, but over other militias, in\r\n      exercise and discipline inferior to themselves. Such were the victories\r\n      which the Greek militia gained over that of the Persian empire; and such,\r\n      too, were those which, in later times, the Swiss militia gained over that\r\n      of the Austrians and Burgundians.\r\n\r\n      The military force of the German and Scythian nations, who established\r\n      themselves upon ruins of the western empire, continued for some time to be\r\n      of the same kind in their new settlements, as it had been in their\r\n      original country. It was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen, which, in\r\n      time of war, took the field under the command of the same chieftains whom\r\n      it was accustomed to obey in peace. It was, therefore, tolerably well\r\n      exercised, and tolerably well disciplined. As arts and industry advanced,\r\n      however, the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed, and the great\r\n      body of the people had less time to spare for military exercises. Both the\r\n      discipline and the exercise of the feudal militia, therefore, went\r\n      gradually to ruin, and standing armies were gradually introduced to supply\r\n      the place of it. When the expedient of a standing army, besides, had once\r\n      been adopted by one civilized nation, it became necessary that all its\r\n      neighbours should follow the example. They soon found that their safety\r\n      depended upon their doing so, and that their own militia was altogether\r\n      incapable of resisting the attack of such an army.\r\n\r\n      The soldiers of a standing army, though they may never have seen an enemy,\r\n      yet have frequently appeared to possess all the courage of veteran troops,\r\n      and, the very moment that they took the field, to have been fit to face\r\n      the hardiest and most experienced veterans. In 1756, when the Russian army\r\n      marched into Poland, the valour of the Russian soldiers did not appear\r\n      inferior to that of the Prussians, at that time supposed to be the\r\n      hardiest and most experienced veterans in Europe. The Russian empire,\r\n      however, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before, and\r\n      could at that time have very few soldiers who had ever seen an enemy. When\r\n      the Spanish war broke out in 1739, England had enjoyed a profound peace\r\n      for about eight-and-twenty years. The valour of her soldiers, however, far\r\n      from being corrupted by that long peace, was never more distinguished than\r\n      in the attempt upon Carthagena, the first unfortunate exploit of that\r\n      unfortunate war. In a long peace, the generals, perhaps, may sometimes\r\n      forget their skill; but where a well regulated standing army has been kept\r\n      up, the soldiers seem never to forget their valour.\r\n\r\n      When a civilized nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at\r\n      all times exposed to be conquered by any barbarous nation which happens to\r\n      be in its neighbourhood. The frequent conquests of all the civilized\r\n      countries in Asia by the Tartars, sufficiently demonstrates the natural\r\n      superiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized\r\n      nation. A well regulated standing army is superior to every militia. Such\r\n      an army, as it can best be maintained by an opulent and civilized nation,\r\n      so it can alone defend such a nation against the invasion of a poor and\r\n      barbarous neighbour. It is only by means of a standing army, therefore,\r\n      that the civilization of any country can be perpetuated, or even\r\n      preserved, for any considerable time.\r\n\r\n      As it is only by means of a well regulated standing army, that a civilized\r\n      country can be defended, so it is only by means of it that a barbarous\r\n      country can be suddenly and tolerably civilized. A standing army\r\n      establishes, with an irresistible force, the law of the sovereign through\r\n      the remotest provinces of the empire, and maintains some degree of regular\r\n      government in countries which could not otherwise admit of any. Whoever\r\n      examines with attention, the improvements which Peter the Great introduced\r\n      into the Russian empire, will find that they almost all resolve themselves\r\n      into the establishment of a well regulated standing army. It is the\r\n      instrument which executes and maintains all his other regulations. That\r\n      degree of order and internal peace, which that empire has ever since\r\n      enjoyed, is altogether owing to the influence of that army.\r\n\r\n      Men of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army, as\r\n      dangerous to liberty. It certainly is so, wherever the interest of the\r\n      general, and that of the principal officers, are not necessarily connected\r\n      with the support of the constitution of the state. The standing army of\r\n      Caesar destroyed the Roman republic. The standing army of Cromwell turned\r\n      the long parliament out of doors. But where the sovereign is himself the\r\n      general, and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief\r\n      officers of the army; where the military force is placed under the command\r\n      of those who have the greatest interest in the support of the civil\r\n      authority, because they have themselves the greatest share of that\r\n      authority, a standing army can never be dangerous to liberty. On the\r\n      contrary, it may, in some cases, be favourable to liberty. The security\r\n      which it gives to the sovereign renders unnecessary that troublesome\r\n      jealousy, which, in some modern republics, seems to watch over the\r\n      minutest actions, and to be at all times ready to disturb the peace of\r\n      every citizen. Where the security of the magistrate, though supported by\r\n      the principal people of the country, is endangered by every popular\r\n      discontent; where a small tumult is capable of bringing about in a few\r\n      hours a great revolution, the whole authority of government must be\r\n      employed to suppress and punish every murmur and complaint against it. To\r\n      a sovereign, on the contrary, who feels himself supported, not only by the\r\n      natural aristocracy of the country, but by a well regulated standing army,\r\n      the rudest, the most groundless, and the most licentious remonstrances,\r\n      can give little disturbance. He can safely pardon or neglect them, and his\r\n      consciousness of his own superiority naturally disposes him to do so. That\r\n      degree of liberty which approaches to licentiousness, can be tolerated\r\n      only in countries where the sovereign is secured by a well regulated\r\n      standing army. It is in such countries only, that the public safety does\r\n      not require that the sovereign should be trusted with any discretionary\r\n      power, for suppressing even the impertinent wantonness of this licentious\r\n      liberty.\r\n\r\n      The first duty of the sovereign, therefore, that of defending the society\r\n      from the violence and injustice of other independent societies, grows\r\n      gradually more and more expensive, as the society advances in\r\n      civilization. The military force of the society, which originally cost the\r\n      sovereign no expense, either in time of peace, or in time of war, must, in\r\n      the progress of improvement, first be maintained by him in time of war,\r\n      and afterwards even in time of peace.\r\n\r\n      The great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of\r\n      fire-arms, has enhanced still further both the expense of exercising and\r\n      disciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace, and that\r\n      of employing them in time of war. Both their arms and their ammunition are\r\n      become more expensive. A musket is a more expensive machine than a javelin\r\n      or a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar, than a balista or a catapulta.\r\n      The powder which is spent in a modern review is lost irrecoverably, and\r\n      occasions a very considerable expense. The javelins and arrows which were\r\n      thrown or shot in an ancient one, could easily be picked up again, and\r\n      were, besides, of very little value. The cannon and the mortar are not\r\n      only much dearer, but much heavier machines than the balista or catapulta;\r\n      and require a greater expense, not only to prepare them for the field, but\r\n      to carry them to it. As the superiority of the modern artillery, too, over\r\n      that of the ancients, is very great; it has become much more difficult,\r\n      and consequently much more expensive, to fortify a town, so as to resist,\r\n      even for a few weeks, the attack of that superior artillery. In modern\r\n      times, many different causes contribute to render the defence of the\r\n      society more expensive. The unavoidable effects of the natural progress of\r\n      improvement have, in this respect, been a good deal enhanced by a great\r\n      revolution in the art of war, to which a mere accident, the invention of\r\n      gunpowder, seems to have given occasion.\r\n\r\n      In modern war, the great expense of firearms gives an evident advantage to\r\n      the nation which can best afford that expense; and, consequently, to an\r\n      opulent and civilized, over a poor and barbarous nation. In ancient times,\r\n      the opulent and civilized found it difficult to defend themselves against\r\n      the poor and barbarous nations. In modern times, the poor and barbarous\r\n      find it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilized.\r\n      The invention of fire-arms, an invention which at first sight appears to\r\n      be so pernicious, is certainly favourable, both to the permanency and to\r\n      the extension of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART II. Of the Expense of Justice\r\n\r\n      The second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible,\r\n      every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every\r\n      other member of it, or the duty of establishing an exact administration of\r\n      justice, requires two very different degrees of expense in the different\r\n      periods of society.\r\n\r\n      Among nations of hunters, as there is scarce any property, or at least\r\n      none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour; so there is\r\n      seldom any established magistrate, or any regular administration of\r\n      justice. Men who have no property, can injure one another only in their\r\n      persons or reputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames\r\n      another, though he to whom the injury is done suffers, he who does it\r\n      receives no benefit. It is otherwise with the injuries to property. The\r\n      benefit of the person who does the injury is often equal to the loss of\r\n      him who suffers it. Envy, malice, or resentment, are the only passions\r\n      which can prompt one man to injure another in his person or reputation.\r\n      But the greater part of men are not very frequently under the influence of\r\n      those passions; and the very worst men are so only occasionally. As their\r\n      gratification, too, how agreeable soever it may be to certain characters,\r\n      is not attended with any real or permanent advantage, it is, in the\r\n      greater part of men, commonly restrained by prudential considerations. Men\r\n      may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security,\r\n      though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of\r\n      those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the\r\n      hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the\r\n      passions which prompt to invade property; passions much more steady in\r\n      their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever\r\n      there is a great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich\r\n      man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the\r\n      few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites\r\n      the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and\r\n      prompted by envy to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter\r\n      of the civil magistrate, that the owner of that valuable property, which\r\n      is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive\r\n      generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times\r\n      surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can\r\n      never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the\r\n      powerful arm of the civil magistrate, continually held up to chastise it.\r\n      The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily\r\n      requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no\r\n      property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days\r\n      labour, civil government is not so necessary.\r\n\r\n      Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of\r\n      civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable\r\n      property; so the principal causes, which naturally introduce\r\n      subordination, gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable\r\n      property.\r\n\r\n      The causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination, or\r\n      which naturally and antecedent to any civil institution, give some men\r\n      some superiority over the greater part of their brethren, seem to be four\r\n      in number.\r\n\r\n      The first of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of personal\r\n      qualifications, of strength, beauty, and agility of body; of wisdom and\r\n      virtue; of prudence, justice, fortitude, and moderation of mind. The\r\n      qualifications of the body, unless supported by those of the mind, can\r\n      give little authority in any period of society. He is a very strong man,\r\n      who, by mere strength of body, can force two weak ones to obey him. The\r\n      qualifications of the mind can alone give very great authority. They are\r\n      however, invisible qualities; always disputable, and generally disputed.\r\n      No society, whether barbarous or civilized, has ever found it convenient\r\n      to settle the rules of precedency of rank and subordination, according to\r\n      those invisible qualities; but according to something that is more plain\r\n      and palpable.\r\n\r\n      The second of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of age. An\r\n      old man, provided his age is not so far advanced as to give suspicion of\r\n      dotage, is everywhere more respected than a young man of equal rank,\r\n      fortune, and abilities. Among nations of hunters, such as the native\r\n      tribes of North America, age is the sole foundation of rank and\r\n      precedency. Among them, father is the appellation of a superior; brother,\r\n      of an equal; and son, of an inferior. In the most opulent and civilized\r\n      nations, age regulates rank among those who are in every other respect\r\n      equal; and among whom, therefore, there is nothing else to regulate it.\r\n      Among brothers and among sisters, the eldest always takes place; and in\r\n      the succession of the paternal estate, every thing which cannot be\r\n      divided, but must go entire to one person, such as a title of honour, is\r\n      in most cases given to the eldest. Age is a plain and palpable quality,\r\n      which admits of no dispute.\r\n\r\n      The third of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of fortune.\r\n      The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of society,\r\n      is, perhaps, greatest in the rudest ages of society, which admits of any\r\n      considerable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of whose\r\n      flocks and herds is sufficient to maintain a thousand men, cannot well\r\n      employ that increase in any other way than in maintaining a thousand men.\r\n      The rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured produce\r\n      any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that part\r\n      of his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption. The\r\n      thousand men whom he thus maintains, depending entirely upon him for their\r\n      subsistence, must both obey his orders in war, and submit to his\r\n      jurisdiction in peace. He is necessarily both their general and their\r\n      judge, and his chieftainship is the necessary effect of the superiority of\r\n      his fortune. In an opulent and civilized society, a man may possess a much\r\n      greater fortune, and yet not be able to command a dozen of people. Though\r\n      the produce of his estate may be sufficient to maintain, and may, perhaps,\r\n      actually maintain, more than a thousand people, yet, as those people pay\r\n      for every thing which they get from him, as he gives scarce any thing to\r\n      any body but in exchange for an equivalent, there is scarce anybody who\r\n      considers himself as entirely dependent upon him, and his authority\r\n      extends only over a few menial servants. The authority of fortune,\r\n      however, is very great, even in an opulent and civilized society. That it\r\n      is much greater than that either of age or of personal qualities, has been\r\n      the constant complaint of every period of society which admitted of any\r\n      considerable inequality of fortune. The first period of society, that of\r\n      hunters, admits of no such inequality. Universal poverty establishes their\r\n      universal equality; and the superiority, either of age or of personal\r\n      qualities, are the feeble, but the sole foundations of authority and\r\n      subordination. There is, therefore, little or no authority or\r\n      subordination in this period of society. The second period of society,\r\n      that of shepherds, admits of very great inequalities of fortune, and there\r\n      is no period in which the superiority of fortune gives so great authority\r\n      to those who possess it. There is no period, accordingly, in which\r\n      authority and subordination are more perfectly established. The authority\r\n      of an Arabian scherif is very great; that of a Tartar khan altogether\r\n      despotical.\r\n\r\n      The fourth of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of birth.\r\n      Superiority of birth supposes an ancient superiority of fortune in the\r\n      family of the person who claims it. All families are equally ancient; and\r\n      the ancestors of the prince, though they may be better known, cannot well\r\n      be more numerous than those of the beggar. Antiquity of family means\r\n      everywhere the antiquity either of wealth, or of that greatness which is\r\n      commonly either founded upon wealth, or accompanied with it. Upstart\r\n      greatness is everywhere less respected than ancient greatness. The hatred\r\n      of usurpers, the love of the family of an ancient monarch, are in a great\r\n      measure founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the former,\r\n      and upon their veneration for the latter. As a military officer submits,\r\n      without reluctance, to the authority of a superior by whom he has always\r\n      been commanded, but cannot bear that his inferior should be set over his\r\n      head; so men easily submit to a family to whom they and their ancestors\r\n      have always submitted; but are fired with indignation when another family,\r\n      in whom they had never acknowledged any such superiority, assumes a\r\n      dominion over them.\r\n\r\n      The distinction of birth, being subsequent to the inequality of fortune,\r\n      can have no place in nations of hunters, among whom all men, being equal\r\n      in fortune, must likewise be very nearly equal in birth. The son of a wise\r\n      and brave man may, indeed, even among them, be somewhat more respected\r\n      than a man of equal merit, who has the misfortune to be the son of a fool\r\n      or a coward. The difference, however will not be very great; and there\r\n      never was, I believe, a great family in the world, whose illustration was\r\n      entirely derived from the inheritance of wisdom and virtue.\r\n\r\n      The distinction of birth not only may, but always does, take place among\r\n      nations of shepherds. Such nations are always strangers to every sort of\r\n      luxury, and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by\r\n      improvident profusion. There are no nations, accordingly, who abound more\r\n      in families revered and honoured on account of their descent from a long\r\n      race of great and illustrious ancestors; because there are no nations\r\n      among whom wealth is likely to continue longer in the same families.\r\n\r\n      Birth and fortune are evidently the two circumstances which principally\r\n      set one man above another. They are the two great sources of personal\r\n      distinction, and are, therefore, the principal causes which naturally\r\n      establish authority and subordination among men. Among nations of\r\n      shepherds, both those causes operate with their full force. The great\r\n      shepherd or herdsman, respected on account of his great wealth, and of the\r\n      great number of those who depend upon him for subsistence, and revered on\r\n      account of the nobleness of his birth, and of the immemorial antiquity or\r\n      his illustrious family, has a natural authority over all the inferior\r\n      shepherds or herdsmen of his horde or clan. He can command the united\r\n      force of a greater number of people than any of them. His military power\r\n      is greater than that of any of them. In time of war, they are all of them\r\n      naturally disposed to muster themselves under his banner, rather than\r\n      under that of any other person; and his birth and fortune thus naturally\r\n      procure to him some sort of executive power. By commanding, too, the\r\n      united force of a greater number of people than any of them, he is best\r\n      able to compel any one of them, who may have injured another, to\r\n      compensate the wrong. He is the person, therefore, to whom all those who\r\n      are too weak to defend themselves naturally look up for protection. It is\r\n      to him that they naturally complain of the injuries which they imagine\r\n      have been done to them; and his interposition, in such cases, is more\r\n      easily submitted to, even by the person complained of, than that of any\r\n      other person would be. His birth and fortune thus naturally procure him\r\n      some sort of judicial authority.\r\n\r\n      It is in the age of shepherds, in the second period of society, that the\r\n      inequality of fortune first begins to take place, and introduces among men\r\n      a degree of authority and subordination, which could not possibly exist\r\n      before. It thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which\r\n      is indispensably necessary for its own preservation; and it seems to do\r\n      this naturally, and even independent of the consideration of that\r\n      necessity. The consideration of that necessity comes, no doubt,\r\n      afterwards, to contribute very much to maintain and secure that authority\r\n      and subordination. The rich, in particular, are necessarily interested to\r\n      support that order of things, which can alone secure them in the\r\n      possession of their own advantages. Men of inferior wealth combine to\r\n      defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in\r\n      order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the\r\n      possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel, that\r\n      the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of\r\n      those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their\r\n      lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority; and that upon\r\n      their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in\r\n      subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel\r\n      themselves interested to defend the property, and to support the\r\n      authority, of their own little sovereign, in order that he may be able to\r\n      defend their property, and to support their authority. Civil government,\r\n      so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is, in reality,\r\n      instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who\r\n      have some property against those who have none at all.\r\n\r\n      The judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being a\r\n      cause of expense, was, for a long time, a source of revenue to him. The\r\n      persons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it,\r\n      and a present never failed to accompany a petition. After the authority of\r\n      the sovereign, too, was thoroughly established, the person found guilty,\r\n      over and above the satisfaction which he was obliged to make to the party,\r\n      was like-wise forced to pay an amercement to the sovereign. He had given\r\n      trouble, he had disturbed, he had broke the peace of his lord the king,\r\n      and for those offences an amercement was thought due. In the Tartar\r\n      governments of Asia, in the governments of Europe which were founded by\r\n      the German and Scythian nations who overturned the Roman empire, the\r\n      administration of justice was a considerable source of revenue, both to\r\n      the sovereign, and to all the lesser chiefs or lords who exercised under\r\n      him any particular jurisdiction, either over some particular tribe or\r\n      clan, or over some particular territory or district. Originally, both the\r\n      sovereign and the inferior chiefs used to exercise this jurisdiction in\r\n      their own persons. Afterwards, they universally found it convenient to\r\n      delegate it to some substitute, bailiff, or judge. This substitute,\r\n      however, was still obliged to account to his principal or constituent for\r\n      the profits of the jurisdiction. Whoever reads the instructions (They are\r\n      to be found in Tyrol’s History of England) which were given to the judges\r\n      of the circuit in the time of Henry II will see clearly that those judges\r\n      were a sort of itinerant factors, sent round the country for the purpose\r\n      of levying certain branches of the king’s revenue. In those days, the\r\n      administration of justice not only afforded a certain revenue to the\r\n      sovereign, but, to procure this revenue, seems to have been one of the\r\n      principal advantages which he proposed to obtain by the administration of\r\n      justice.\r\n\r\n      This scheme of making the administration of justice subservient to the\r\n      purposes of revenue, could scarce fail to be productive of several very\r\n      gross abuses. The person who applied for justice with a large present in\r\n      his hand, was likely to get something more than justice; while he who\r\n      applied for it with a small one was likely to get something less. Justice,\r\n      too, might frequently be delayed, in order that this present might be\r\n      repeated. The amercement, besides, of the person complained of, might\r\n      frequently suggest a very strong reason for finding him in the wrong, even\r\n      when he had not really been so. That such abuses were far from being\r\n      uncommon, the ancient history of every country in Europe bears witness.\r\n\r\n      When the sovereign or chief exercises his judicial authority in his own\r\n      person, how much soever he might abuse it, it must have been scarce\r\n      possible to get any redress; because there could seldom be any body\r\n      powerful enough to call him to account. When he exercised it by a bailiff,\r\n      indeed, redress might sometimes be had. If it was for his own benefit\r\n      only, that the bailiff had been guilty of an act of injustice, the\r\n      sovereign himself might not always be unwilling to punish him, or to\r\n      oblige him to repair the wrong. But if it was for the benefit of his\r\n      sovereign; if it was in order to make court to the person who appointed\r\n      him, and who might prefer him, that he had committed any act of\r\n      oppression; redress would, upon most occasions, be as impossible as if the\r\n      sovereign had committed it himself. In all barbarous governments,\r\n      accordingly, in all those ancient governments of Europe in particular,\r\n      which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the administration\r\n      of justice appears for a long time to have been extremely corrupt; far\r\n      from being quite equal and impartial, even under the best monarchs, and\r\n      altogether profligate under the worst.\r\n\r\n      Among nations of shepherds, where the sovereign or chief is only the\r\n      greatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan, he is maintained in\r\n      the same manner as any of his vassals or subjects, by the increase of his\r\n      own herds or flocks. Among those nations of husbandmen, who are but just\r\n      come out of the shepherd state, and who are not much advanced beyond that\r\n      state, such as the Greek tribes appear to have been about the time of the\r\n      Trojan war, and our German and Scythian ancestors, when they first settled\r\n      upon the ruins of the western empire; the sovereign or chief is, in the\r\n      same manner, only the greatest landlord of the country, and is maintained\r\n      in the same manner as any other landlord, by a revenue derived from his\r\n      own private estate, or from what, in modern Europe, was called the demesne\r\n      of the crown. His subjects, upon ordinary occasions, contribute nothing to\r\n      his support, except when, in order to protect them from the oppression of\r\n      some of their fellow-subjects, they stand in need of his authority. The\r\n      presents which they make him upon such occasions constitute the whole\r\n      ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, except, perhaps, upon\r\n      some very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from his dominion over\r\n      them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles, for his friendship,\r\n      the sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advantage which he\r\n      mentions as likely to be derived from it was, that the people would honour\r\n      him with presents. As long as such presents, as long as the emoluments of\r\n      justice, or what may be called the fees of court, constituted, in this\r\n      manner, the whole ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived from his\r\n      sovereignty, it could not well be expected, it could not even decently be\r\n      proposed, that he should give them up altogether. It might, and it\r\n      frequently was proposed, that he should regulate and ascertain them. But\r\n      after they had been so regulated and ascertained, how to hinder a person\r\n      who was all-powerful from extending them beyond those regulations, was\r\n      still very difficult, not to say impossible. During the continuance of\r\n      this state of things, therefore, the corruption of justice, naturally\r\n      resulting from the arbitrary and uncertain nature of those presents,\r\n      scarce admitted of any effectual remedy.\r\n\r\n      But when, from different causes, chiefly from the continually increasing\r\n      expense of defending the nation against the invasion of other nations, the\r\n      private estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient for\r\n      defraying the expense of the sovereignty; and when it had become necessary\r\n      that the people should, for their own security, contribute towards this\r\n      expense by taxes of different kinds; it seems to have been very commonly\r\n      stipulated, that no present for the administration of justice should,\r\n      under any pretence, be accepted either by the sovereign, or by his\r\n      bailiffs and substitutes, the judges. Those presents, it seems to have\r\n      been supposed, could more easily be abolished altogether, than effectually\r\n      regulated and ascertained. Fixed salaries were appointed to the judges,\r\n      which were supposed to compensate to them the loss of whatever might have\r\n      been their share of the ancient emoluments of justice; as the taxes more\r\n      than compensated to the sovereign the loss of his. Justice was then said\r\n      to be administered gratis.\r\n\r\n      Justice, however, never was in reality administered gratis in any country.\r\n      Lawyers and attorneys, at least, must always be paid by the parties; and\r\n      if they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than they\r\n      actually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and attorneys,\r\n      amount, in every court, to a much greater sum than the salaries of the\r\n      judges. The circumstance of those salaries being paid by the crown, can\r\n      nowhere much diminish the necessary expense of a law-suit. But it was not\r\n      so much to diminish the expense, as to prevent the corruption of justice,\r\n      that the judges were prohibited from receiving my present or fee from the\r\n      parties.\r\n\r\n      The office of judge is in itself so very honourable, that men are willing\r\n      to accept of it, though accompanied with very small emoluments. The\r\n      inferior office of justice of peace, though attended with a good deal of\r\n      trouble, and in most cases with no emoluments at all, is an object of\r\n      ambition to the greater part of our country gentlemen. The salaries of all\r\n      the different judges, high and low, together with the whole expense of the\r\n      administration and execution of justice, even where it is not managed with\r\n      very good economy, makes, in any civilized country, but a very\r\n      inconsiderable part of the whole expense of government.\r\n\r\n      The whole expense of justice, too, might easily be defrayed by the fees of\r\n      court; and, without exposing the administration of justice to any real\r\n      hazard of corruption, the public revenue might thus be entirely discharged\r\n      from a certain, though perhaps but a small incumbrance. It is difficult to\r\n      regulate the fees of court effectually, where a person so powerful as the\r\n      sovereign is to share in them and to derive any considerable part of his\r\n      revenue from them. It is very easy, where the judge is the principal\r\n      person who can reap any benefit from them. The law can very easily oblige\r\n      the judge to respect the regulation though it might not always be able to\r\n      make the sovereign respect it. Where the fees of court are precisely\r\n      regulated and ascertained where they are paid all at once, at a certain\r\n      period of every process, into the hands of a cashier or receiver, to be by\r\n      him distributed in certain known proportions among the different judges\r\n      after the process is decided and not till it is decided; there seems to be\r\n      no more danger of corruption than when such fees are prohibited\r\n      altogether. Those fees, without occasioning any considerable increase in\r\n      the expense of a law-suit, might be rendered fully sufficient for\r\n      defraying the whole expense of justice. But not being paid to the judges\r\n      till the process was determined, they might be some incitement to the\r\n      diligence of the court in examining and deciding it. In courts which\r\n      consisted of a considerable number of judges, by proportioning the share\r\n      of each judge to the number of hours and days which he had employed in\r\n      examining the process, either in the court, or in a committee, by order of\r\n      the court, those fees might give some encouragement to the diligence of\r\n      each particular judge. Public services are never better performed, than\r\n      when their reward comes only in consequence of their being performed, and\r\n      is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them. In the\r\n      different parliaments of France, the fees of court (called epices and\r\n      vacations) constitute the far greater part of the emoluments of the\r\n      judges. After all deductions are made, the neat salary paid by the crown\r\n      to a counsellor or judge in the parliament of Thoulouse, in rank and\r\n      dignity the second parliament of the kingdom, amounts only to 150 livres,\r\n      about £6:11s. sterling a-year. About seven years ago, that sum was in the\r\n      same place the ordinary yearly wages of a common footman. The distribution\r\n      of these epices, too, is according to the diligence of the judges. A\r\n      diligent judge gains a comfortable, though moderate revenue, by his\r\n      office; an idle one gets little more than his salary. Those parliaments\r\n      are, perhaps, in many respects, not very convenient courts of justice; but\r\n      they have never been accused; they seem never even to have been suspected\r\n      of corruption.\r\n\r\n      The fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of\r\n      the different courts of justice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw\r\n      to itself as much business as it could, and was, upon that account,\r\n      willing to take cognizance of many suits which were not originally\r\n      intended to fall under its jurisdiction. The court of king’s bench,\r\n      instituted for the trial of criminal causes only, took cognizance of civil\r\n      suits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing him\r\n      justice, had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanour. The court of\r\n      exchequer, instituted for the levying of the king’s revenue, and for\r\n      enforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king, took\r\n      cognizance of all other contract debts; the planitiff alleging that he\r\n      could not pay the king, because the defendant would not pay him. In\r\n      consequence of such fictions, it came, in many cases, to depend altogether\r\n      upon the parties, before what court they would choose to have their cause\r\n      tried, and each court endeavoured, by superior dispatch and impartiality,\r\n      to draw to itself as many causes as it could. The present admirable\r\n      constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps, originally,\r\n      in a great measure, formed by this emulation, which anciently took place\r\n      between their respective judges: each judge endeavouring to give, in his\r\n      own court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the law would\r\n      admit, for every sort of injustice. Originally, the courts of law gave\r\n      damages only for breach of contract. The court of chancery, as a court of\r\n      conscience, first took upon it to enforce the specific performance of\r\n      agreements. When the breach of contract consisted in the non-payment of\r\n      money, the damage sustained could be compensated in no other way than by\r\n      ordering payment, which was equivalent to a specific performance of the\r\n      agreement. In such cases, therefore, the remedy of the courts of law was\r\n      sufficient. It was not so in others. When the tenant sued his lord for\r\n      having unjustly outed him of his lease, the damages which he recovered\r\n      were by no means equivalent to the possession of the land. Such causes,\r\n      therefore, for some time, went all to the court of chancery, to the no\r\n      small loss of the courts of law. It was to draw back such causes to\r\n      themselves, that the courts of law are said to have invented the\r\n      artificial and fictitious writ of ejectment, the most effectual remedy for\r\n      an unjust outer or dispossession of land.\r\n\r\n      A stamp-duty upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be\r\n      levied by that court, and applied towards the maintenance of the judges,\r\n      and other officers belonging to it, might in the same manner, afford a\r\n      revenue sufficient for defraying the expense of the administration of\r\n      justice, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the\r\n      society. The judges, indeed, might in this case, be under the temptation\r\n      of multiplying unnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause, in order to\r\n      increase, as much as possible, the produce of such a stamp-duty. It has\r\n      been the custom in modern Europe to regulate, upon most occasions, the\r\n      payment of the attorneys and clerks of court according to the number of\r\n      pages which they had occasion to write; the court, however, requiring that\r\n      each page should contain so many lines, and each line so many words. In\r\n      order to increase their payment, the attorneys and clerks have contrived\r\n      to multiply words beyond all necessity, to the corruption of the law\r\n      language of, I believe, every court of justice in Europe. A like\r\n      temptation might, perhaps, occasion a like corruption in the form of law\r\n      proceedings.\r\n\r\n      But whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to defray its\r\n      own expense, or whether the judges be maintained by fixed salaries paid to\r\n      them from some other fund, it does not seen necessary that the person or\r\n      persons entrusted with the executive power should be charged with the\r\n      management of that fund, or with the payment of those salaries. That fund\r\n      might arise from the rent of landed estates, the management of each estate\r\n      being entrusted to the particular court which was to be maintained by it.\r\n      That fund might arise even from the interest of a sum of money, the\r\n      lending out of which might, in the same manner, be entrusted to the court\r\n      which was to be maintained by it. A part, though indeed but a small part\r\n      of the salary of the judges of the court of session in Scotland, arises\r\n      from the interest of a sum of money. The necessary instability of such a\r\n      fund seems, however, to render it an improper one for the maintenance of\r\n      an institution which ought to last for ever.\r\n\r\n      The separation of the judicial from the executive power, seems originally\r\n      to have arisen from the increasing business of the society, in consequence\r\n      of its increasing improvement. The administration of justice became so\r\n      laborious and so complicated a duty, as to require the undivided attention\r\n      of the person to whom it was entrusted. The person entrusted with the\r\n      executive power, not having leisure to attend to the decision of private\r\n      causes himself, a deputy was appointed to decide them in his stead. In the\r\n      progress of the Roman greatness, the consul was too much occupied with the\r\n      political affairs of the state, to attend to the administration of\r\n      justice. A praetor, therefore, was appointed to administer it in his\r\n      stead. In the progress of the European monarchies, which were founded upon\r\n      the ruins of the Roman empire, the sovereigns and the great lords came\r\n      universally to consider the administration of justice as an office both\r\n      too laborious and too ignoble for them to execute in their own persons.\r\n      They universally, therefore, discharged themselves of it, by appointing a\r\n      deputy, bailiff or judge.\r\n\r\n      When the judicial is united to the executive power, it is scarce possible\r\n      that justice should not frequently be sacrificed to what is vulgarly\r\n      called politics. The persons entrusted with the great interests of the\r\n      state may even without any corrupt views, sometimes imagine it necessary\r\n      to sacrifice to those interests the rights of a private man. But upon the\r\n      impartial administration of justice depends the liberty of every\r\n      individual, the sense which he has of his own security. In order to make\r\n      every individual feel himself perfectly secure in the possession of every\r\n      right which belongs to him, it is not only necessary that the judicial\r\n      should be separated from the executive power, but that it should be\r\n      rendered as much as possible independent of that power. The judge should\r\n      not be liable to be removed from his office according to the caprice of\r\n      that power. The regular payment of his salary should not depend upon the\r\n      good will, or even upon the good economy of that power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART III. Of the Expense of public Works and public Institutions.\r\n\r\n      The third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth, is that of\r\n      erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works,\r\n      which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great\r\n      society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay\r\n      the expense to any individual, or small number of individuals; and which\r\n      it, therefore, cannot be expected that any individual, or small number of\r\n      individuals, should erect or maintain. The performance of this duty\r\n      requires, too, very different degrees of expense in the different periods\r\n      of society.\r\n\r\n      After the public institutions and public works necessary for the defence\r\n      of the society, and for the administration of justice, both of which have\r\n      already been mentioned, the other works and institutions of this kind are\r\n      chiefly for facilitating the commerce of the society, and those for\r\n      promoting the instruction of the people. The institutions for instruction\r\n      are of two kinds: those for the education of the youth, and those for the\r\n      instruction of people of all ages. The consideration of the manner in\r\n      which the expense of those different sorts of public works and\r\n      institutions may be most properly defrayed will divide this third part of\r\n      the present chapter into three different articles.\r\n\r\n      ARTICLE I.—Of the public Works and Institutions for facilitating the\r\n      Commerce of the Society.\r\n\r\n      And, first, of those which are necessary for facilitating Commerce in\r\n      general.\r\n\r\n      That the erection and maintenance of the public works which facilitate the\r\n      commerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals,\r\n      harbours, etc. must require very different degrees of expense in the\r\n      different periods of society, is evident without any proof. The expense of\r\n      making and maintaining the public roads of any country must evidently\r\n      increase with the annual produce of the land and labour of that country,\r\n      or with the quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes necessary to\r\n      fetch and carry upon those roads. The strength of a bridge must be suited\r\n      to the number and weight of the carriages which are likely to pass over\r\n      it. The depth and the supply of water for a navigable canal must be\r\n      proportioned to the number and tonnage of the lighters which are likely to\r\n      carry goods upon it; the extent of a harbour, to the number of the\r\n      shipping which are likely to take shelter in it.\r\n\r\n      It does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works should\r\n      be defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly called, of which\r\n      the collection and application are in most countries, assigned to the\r\n      executive power. The greater part of such public works may easily be so\r\n      managed, as to afford a particular revenue, sufficient for defraying their\r\n      own expense without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the\r\n      society.\r\n\r\n      A highway, a bridge, a navigable canal, for example, may, in most cases,\r\n      be both made add maintained by a small toll upon the carriages which make\r\n      use of them; a harbour, by a moderate port-duty upon the tonnage of the\r\n      shipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another institution for\r\n      facilitating commerce, in many countries, not only defrays its own\r\n      expense, but affords a small revenue or a seignorage to the sovereign. The\r\n      post-office, another institution for the same purpose, over and above\r\n      defraying its own expense, affords, in almost all countries, a very\r\n      considerable revenue to the sovereign.\r\n\r\n      When the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the lighters\r\n      which sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their weight\r\n      or their tonnage, they pay for the maintenance of those public works\r\n      exactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of them. It\r\n      seems scarce possible to invent a more equitable way of maintaining such\r\n      works. This tax or toll, too, though it is advanced by the carrier, is\r\n      finally paid by the consumer, to whom it must always be charged in the\r\n      price of the goods. As the expense of carriage, however, is very much\r\n      reduced by means of such public works, the goods, notwithstanding the\r\n      toll, come cheaper to the consumer than they could otherwise have done,\r\n      their price not being so much raised by the toll, as it is lowered by the\r\n      cheapness of the carriage. The person who finally pays this tax,\r\n      therefore, gains by the application more than he loses by the payment of\r\n      it. His payment is exactly in proportion to his gain. It is, in reality,\r\n      no more than a part of that gain which he is obliged to give up, in order\r\n      to get the rest. It seems impossible to imagine a more equitable method of\r\n      raising a tax. When the toll upon carriages of luxury, upon coaches,\r\n      post-chaises, etc. is made somewhat higher in proportion to their weight,\r\n      than upon carriages of necessary use, such as carts, waggons, etc. the\r\n      indolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute, in a very easy\r\n      manner, to the relief of the poor, by rendering cheaper the transportation\r\n      of heavy goods to all the different parts of the country.\r\n\r\n      When high-roads, bridges, canals, etc. are in this manner made and\r\n      supported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they can\r\n      be made only where that commerce requires them, and, consequently, where\r\n      it is proper to make them. Their expense, too, their grandeur and\r\n      magnificence, must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay. They\r\n      must be made, consequently, as it is proper to make them. A magnificent\r\n      high-road cannot be made through a desert country, where there is little\r\n      or no commerce, or merely because it happens to lead to the country villa\r\n      of the intendant of the province, or to that of some great lord, to whom\r\n      the intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A great bridge cannot\r\n      be thrown over a river at a place where nobody passes, or merely to\r\n      embellish the view from the windows of a neighbouring palace; things which\r\n      sometimes happen in countries, where works of this kind are carried on by\r\n      any other revenue than that which they themselves are capable of\r\n      affording.\r\n\r\n      In several different parts of Europe, the toll or lock-duty upon a canal\r\n      is the property of private persons, whose private interest obliges them to\r\n      keep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the navigation\r\n      necessarily ceases altogether, and, along with it, the whole profit which\r\n      they can make by the tolls. If those tolls were put under the management\r\n      of commissioners, who had themselves no interest in them, they might be\r\n      less attentive to the maintenance of the works which produced them. The\r\n      canal of Languedoc cost the king of France and the province upwards of\r\n      thirteen millions of livres, which (at twenty-eight livres the mark of\r\n      silver, the value of French money in the end of the last century) amounted\r\n      to upwards of nine hundred thousand pounds sterling. When that great work\r\n      was finished, the most likely method, it was found, of keeping it in\r\n      constant repair, was to make a present of the tolls to Riquet, the\r\n      engineer who planned and conducted the work. Those tolls constitute, at\r\n      present, a very large estate to the different branches of the family of\r\n      that gentleman, who have, therefore, a great interest to keep the work in\r\n      constant repair. But had those tolls been put under the management of\r\n      commissioners, who had no such interest, they might perhaps, have been\r\n      dissipated in ornamental and unnecessary expenses, while the most\r\n      essential parts of the works were allowed to go to ruin.\r\n\r\n      The tolls for the maintenance of a highroad cannot, with any safety, be\r\n      made the property of private persons. A high-road, though entirely\r\n      neglected, does not become altogether impassable, though a canal does. The\r\n      proprietors of the tolls upon a high-road, therefore, might neglect\r\n      altogether the repair of the road, and yet continue to levy very nearly\r\n      the same tolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the\r\n      maintenance of such a work should be put under the management of\r\n      commissioners or trustees.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, the abuses which the trustees have committed in the\r\n      management of those tolls, have, in many cases, been very justly\r\n      complained of. At many turnpikes, it has been said, the money levied is\r\n      more than double of what is necessary for executing, in the completest\r\n      manner, the work, which is often executed in a very slovenly manner, and\r\n      sometimes not executed at all. The system of repairing the high-roads by\r\n      tolls of this kind, it must be observed, is not of very long standing. We\r\n      should not wonder, therefore, if it has not yet been brought to that\r\n      degree of perfection of which it seems capable. If mean and improper\r\n      persons are frequently appointed trustees; and if proper courts of\r\n      inspection and account have not yet been established for controlling their\r\n      conduct, and for reducing the tolls to what is barely sufficient for\r\n      executing the work to be done by them; the recency of the institution both\r\n      accounts and apologizes for those defects, of which, by the wisdom of\r\n      parliament, the greater part may, in due time, be gradually remedied.\r\n\r\n      The money levied at the different turnpikes in Great Britain, is supposed\r\n      to exceed so much what is necessary for repairing the roads, that the\r\n      savings which, with proper economy, might be made from it, have been\r\n      considered, even by some ministers, as a very great resource, which might,\r\n      at some time or another, be applied to the exigencies of the state.\r\n      Government, it has been said, by taking the management of the turnpikes\r\n      into its own hands, and by employing the soldiers, who would work for a\r\n      very small addition to their pay, could keep the roads in good order, at a\r\n      much less expense than it can be done by trustees, who have no other\r\n      workmen to employ, but such as derive their whole subsistence from their\r\n      wages. A great revenue, half a million, perhaps {Since publishing the two\r\n      first editions of this book, I have got good reasons to believe that all\r\n      the turnpike tolls levied in Great Britain do not produce a neat revenue\r\n      that amounts to half a million; a sum which, under the management of\r\n      government, would not be sufficient to keep in repair five of the\r\n      principal roads in the kingdom}, it has been pretended, might in this\r\n      manner be gained, without laying any new burden upon the people; and the\r\n      turnpike roads might be made to contribute to the general expense of the\r\n      state, in the same manner as the post-office does at present.\r\n\r\n      That a considerable revenue might be gained in this manner, I have no\r\n      doubt, though probably not near so much as the projectors of this plan\r\n      have supposed. The plan itself, however, seems liable to several very\r\n      important objections.\r\n\r\n      First, If the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be\r\n      considered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the\r\n      state, they would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were supposed\r\n      to require. According to the policy of Great Britain, therefore, they\r\n      would probably he augmented very fast. The facility with which a great\r\n      revenue could be drawn from them, would probably encourage administration\r\n      to recur very frequently te this resource. Though it may, perhaps, be more\r\n      than doubtful whether half a million could by any economy be saved out of\r\n      the present tolls, it can scarcely be doubted, but that a million might be\r\n      saved out of them, if they were doubled; and perhaps two millions, if they\r\n      were tripled {I have now good reason to believe that all these conjectural\r\n      sums are by much too large.}. This great revenue, too, might be levied\r\n      without the appointment of a single new officer to collect and receive it.\r\n      But the turnpike tolls, being continually augmented in this manner,\r\n      instead of facilitating the inland commerce of the country, as at present,\r\n      would soon become a very great incumbrance upon it. The expense of\r\n      transporting all heavy goods from one part of the country to another,\r\n      would soon be so much increased, the market for all such goods,\r\n      consequently, would soon be so much narrowed, that their production would\r\n      be in a great measure discouraged, and the most important branches of the\r\n      domestic industry of the country annihilated altogether.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, A tax upon carriages, in proportion to their weight, though a\r\n      very equal tax when applied to the sole purpose of repairing the roads, is\r\n      a very unequal one when applied to any other purpose, or to supply the\r\n      common exigencies of the state. When it is applied to the sole purpose\r\n      above mentioned, each carriage is supposed to pay exactly for the wear and\r\n      tear which that carriage occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to\r\n      any other purpose, each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that\r\n      wear and tear, and contributes to the supply of some other exigency of the\r\n      state. But as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion to\r\n      their weight and not to their value, it is chiefly paid by the consumers\r\n      of coarse and bulky, not by those of precious and light commodities.\r\n      Whatever exigency of the state, therefore, this tax might be intended to\r\n      supply, that exigency would be chiefly supplied at the expense of the\r\n      poor, not of the rich; at the expense of those who are least able to\r\n      supply it, not of those who are most able.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, If government should at any time neglect the reparation of the\r\n      high-roads, it would be still more difficult, than it is at present, to\r\n      compel the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls. A large\r\n      revenue might thus be levied upon the people, without any part of it being\r\n      applied to the only purpose to which a revenue levied in this manner ought\r\n      ever to be applied. If the meanness and poverty of the trustees of\r\n      turnpike roads render it sometimes difficult, at present, to oblige them\r\n      to repair their wrong; their wealth and greatness would render it ten\r\n      times more so in the case which is here supposed.\r\n\r\n      In France, the funds destined for the reparation of the high-roads are\r\n      under the immediate direction of the executive power. Those funds consist,\r\n      partly in a certain number of days labour, which the country people are in\r\n      most parts of Europe obliged to give to the reparation of the highways;\r\n      and partly in such a portion of the general revenue of the state as the\r\n      king chooses to spare from his other expenses.\r\n\r\n      By the ancient law of France, as well as by that of most other parts of\r\n      Europe, the labour of the country people was under the direction of a\r\n      local or provincial magistracy, which had no immediate dependency upon the\r\n      king’s council. But, by the present practice, both the labour of the\r\n      country people, and whatever other fund the king may choose to assign for\r\n      the reparation of the high-roads in any particular province or generality,\r\n      are entirely under the management of the intendant; an officer who is\r\n      appointed and removed by the king’s council who receives his orders from\r\n      it, and is in constant correspondence with it. In the progress of\r\n      despotism, the authority of the executive power gradually absorbs that of\r\n      every other power in the state, and assumes to itself the management of\r\n      every branch of revenue which is destined for any public purpose. In\r\n      France, however, the great post-roads, the roads which make the\r\n      communication between the principal towns of the kingdom, are in general\r\n      kept in good order; and, in some provinces, are even a good deal superior\r\n      to the greater part of the turnpike roads of England. But what we call the\r\n      cross roads, that is, the far greater part of the roads in the country,\r\n      are entirely neglected, and are in many places absolutely impassable for\r\n      any heavy carriage. In some places it is even dangerous to travel on\r\n      horseback, and mules are the only conveyance which can safely be trusted.\r\n      The proud minister of an ostentatious court, may frequently take pleasure\r\n      in executing a work of splendour and magnificence, such as a great\r\n      highway, which is frequently seen by the principal nobility, whose\r\n      applauses not only flatter his vanity, but even contribute to support his\r\n      interest at court. But to execute a great number of little works, in which\r\n      nothing that can be done can make any great appearance, or excite the\r\n      smallest degree of admiration in any traveller, and which, in short, have\r\n      nothing to recommend them but their extreme utility, is a business which\r\n      appears, in every respect, too mean and paltry to merit the attention of\r\n      so great a magistrate. Under such an administration therefore, such works\r\n      are almost always entirely neglected.\r\n\r\n      In China, and in several other governments of Asia, the executive power\r\n      charges itself both with the reparation of the high-roads, and with the\r\n      maintenance of the navigable canals. In the instructions which are given\r\n      to the governor of each province, those objects, it is said, are\r\n      constantly recommended to him, and the judgment which the court forms of\r\n      his conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to\r\n      have paid to this part of his instructions. This branch of public police,\r\n      accordingly, is said to be very much attended to in all those countries,\r\n      but particularly in China, where the high-roads, and still more the\r\n      navigable canals, it is pretended, exceed very much every thing of the\r\n      same kind which is known in Europe. The accounts of those works, however,\r\n      which have been transmitted to Europe, have generally been drawn up by\r\n      weak and wondering travellers; frequently by stupid and lying\r\n      missionaries. If they had been examined by more intelligent eyes, and if\r\n      the accounts of them had been reported by more faithful witnesses, they\r\n      would not, perhaps, appear to be so wonderful. The account which Bernier\r\n      gives of some works of this kind in Indostan, falls very short of what had\r\n      been reported of them by other travellers, more disposed to the marvellous\r\n      than he was. It may too, perhaps, be in those countries, as it is in\r\n      France, where the great roads, the great communications, which are likely\r\n      to be the subjects of conversation at the court and in the capital, are\r\n      attended to, and all the rest neglected. In China, besides, in Indostan,\r\n      and in several other governments of Asia, the revenue of the sovereign\r\n      arises almost altogether from a land tax or land rent, which rises or\r\n      falls with the rise and fall of the annual produce of the land. The great\r\n      interest of the sovereign, therefore, his revenue, is in such countries\r\n      necessarily and immediately connected with the cultivation of the land,\r\n      with the greatness of its produce, and with the value of its produce. But\r\n      in order to render that produce both as great and as valuable as possible,\r\n      it is necessary to procure to it as extensive a market as possible, and\r\n      consequently to establish the freest, the easiest, and the least expensive\r\n      communication between all the different parts of the country; which can be\r\n      done only by means of the best roads and the best navigable canals. But\r\n      the revenue of the sovereign does not, in any part of Europe, arise\r\n      chiefly from a land tax or land rent. In all the great kingdoms of Europe,\r\n      perhaps, the greater part of it may ultimately depend upon the produce of\r\n      the land: but that dependency is neither so immediate nor so evident. In\r\n      Europe, therefore, the sovereign does not feel himself so directly called\r\n      upon to promote the increase, both in quantity and value of the produce of\r\n      the land, or, by maintaining good roads and canals, to provide the most\r\n      extensive market for that produce. Though it should be true, therefore,\r\n      what I apprehend is not a little doubtful, that in some parts of Asia this\r\n      department of the public police is very properly managed by the executive\r\n      power, there is not the least probability that, during the present state\r\n      of things, it could be tolerably managed by that power in any part of\r\n      Europe.\r\n\r\n      Even those public works, which are of such a nature that they cannot\r\n      afford any revenue for maintaining themselves, but of which the\r\n      conveniency is nearly confined to some particular place or district, are\r\n      always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the\r\n      management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general\r\n      revenue of the state, of which the executive power must always have the\r\n      management. Were the streets of London to be lighted and paved at the\r\n      expense of the treasury, is there any probability that they would be so\r\n      well lighted and paved as they are at present, or even at so small an\r\n      expense? The expense, besides, instead of being raised by a local tax upon\r\n      the inhabitants of each particular street, parish, or district in London,\r\n      would, in this case, be defrayed out of the general revenue of the state,\r\n      and would consequently be raised by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the\r\n      kingdom, of whom the greater part derive no sort of benefit from the\r\n      lighting and paving of the streets of London.\r\n\r\n      The abuses which sometimes creep into the local and provincial\r\n      administration of a local and provincial revenue, how enormous soever they\r\n      may appear, are in reality, however, almost always very trifling in\r\n      comparison of those which commonly take place in the administration and\r\n      expenditure of the revenue of a great empire. They are, besides, much more\r\n      easily corrected. Under the local or provincial administration of the\r\n      justices of the peace in Great Britain, the six days labour which the\r\n      country people are obliged to give to the reparation of the highways, is\r\n      not always, perhaps, very judiciously applied, but it is scarce ever\r\n      exacted with any circumstance of cruelty or oppression. In France, under\r\n      the administration of the intendants, the application is not always more\r\n      judicious, and the exaction is frequently the most cruel and oppressive.\r\n      Such corvees, as they are called, make one of the principal instruments of\r\n      tyranny by which those officers chastise any parish or communeaute, which\r\n      has had the misfortune to fall under their displeasure.\r\n\r\n      Of the public Works and Institution which are necessary for facilitating\r\n      particular Branches of Commerce.\r\n\r\n      The object of the public works and institutions above mentioned, is to\r\n      facilitate commerce in general. But in order to facilitate some particular\r\n      branches of it, particular institutions are necessary, which again require\r\n      a particular and extraordinary expense.\r\n\r\n      Some particular branches of commerce which are carried on with barbarous\r\n      and uncivilized nations, require extraordinary protection. An ordinary\r\n      store or counting-house could give little security to the goods of the\r\n      merchants who trade to the western coast of Africa. To defend them from\r\n      the barbarous natives, it is necessary that the place where they are\r\n      deposited should be in some measure fortified. The disorders in the\r\n      government of Indostan have been supposed to render a like precaution\r\n      necessary, even among that mild and gentle people; and it was under\r\n      pretence of securing their persons and property from violence, that both\r\n      the English and French East India companies were allowed to erect the\r\n      first forts which they possessed in that country. Among other nations,\r\n      whose vigorous government will suffer no strangers to possess any\r\n      fortified place within their territory, it may be necessary to maintain\r\n      some ambassador, minister, or consul, who may both decide, according to\r\n      their own customs, the differences arising among his own countrymen, and,\r\n      in their disputes with the natives, may by means of his public character,\r\n      interfere with more authority and afford them a more powerful protection\r\n      than they could expect from any private man. The interests of commerce\r\n      have frequently made it necessary to maintain ministers in foreign\r\n      countries, where the purposes either of war or alliance would not have\r\n      required any. The commerce of the Turkey company first occasioned the\r\n      establishment of an ordinary ambassador at Constantinople. The first\r\n      English embassies to Russia arose altogether from commercial interests.\r\n      The constant interference with those interests, necessarily occasioned\r\n      between the subjects of the different states of Europe, has probably\r\n      introduced the custom of keeping, in all neighbouring countries,\r\n      ambassadors or ministers constantly resident, even in the time of peace.\r\n      This custom, unknown to ancient times, seems not to be older than the end\r\n      of the fifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth century; that is, than the\r\n      time when commerce first began to extend itself to the greater part of the\r\n      nations of Europe, and when they first began to attend to its interests.\r\n\r\n      It seems not unreasonable, that the extraordinary expense which the\r\n      protection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion, should be\r\n      defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate\r\n      fine, for example, to be paid by the traders when they first enter into\r\n      it; or, what is more equal, by a particular duty of so much per cent. upon\r\n      the goods which they either import into, or export out of, the particular\r\n      countries with which it is carried on. The protection of trade, in\r\n      general, from pirates and freebooters, is said to have given occasion to\r\n      the first institution of the duties of customs. But, if it was thought\r\n      reasonable to lay a general tax upon trade, in order to defray the expense\r\n      of protecting trade in general, it should seem equally reasonable to lay a\r\n      particular tax upon a particular branch of trade, in order to defray the\r\n      extraordinary expense of protecting that branch.\r\n\r\n      The protection of trade, in general, has always been considered as\r\n      essential to the defence of the commonwealth, and, upon that account, a\r\n      necessary part of the duty of the executive power. The collection and\r\n      application of the general duties of customs, therefore, have always been\r\n      left to that power. But the protection of any particular branch of trade\r\n      is a part of the general protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the\r\n      duty of that power; and if nations always acted consistently, the\r\n      particular duties levied for the purposes of such particular protection,\r\n      should always have been left equally to its disposal. But in this respect,\r\n      as well as in many others, nations have not always acted consistently; and\r\n      in the greater part of the commercial states of Europe, particular\r\n      companies of merchants have had the address to persuade the legislature to\r\n      entrust to them the performance of this part of the duty of the sovereign,\r\n      together with all the powers which are necessarily connected with it.\r\n\r\n      These companies, though they may, perhaps, have been useful for the first\r\n      introduction of some branches of commerce, by making, at their own\r\n      expense, an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to make,\r\n      have in the long-run proved, universally, either burdensome or useless,\r\n      and have either mismanaged or confined the trade.\r\n\r\n      When those companies do not trade upon a joint stock, but are obliged to\r\n      admit any person, properly qualified, upon paying a certain fine, and\r\n      agreeing to submit to the regulations of the company, each member trading\r\n      upon his own stock, and at his own risk, they are called regulated\r\n      companies. When they trade upon a joint stock, each member sharing in the\r\n      common profit or loss, in proportion to his share in this stock, they are\r\n      called joint-stock companies. Such companies, whether regulated or\r\n      joint-stock, sometimes have, and sometimes have not, exclusive privileges.\r\n\r\n      Regulated companies resemble, in every respect, the corporation of trades,\r\n      so common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of\r\n      Europe; and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same kind. As no\r\n      inhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade, without first\r\n      obtaining his freedom in the incorporation, so, in most cases, no subject\r\n      of the state can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade, for which\r\n      a regulated company is established, without first becoming a member of\r\n      that company. The monopoly is more or less strict, according as the terms\r\n      of admission are more or less difficult, and according as the directors of\r\n      the company have more or less authority, or have it more or less in their\r\n      power to manage in such a manner as to confine the greater part of the\r\n      trade to themselves and their particular friends. In the most ancient\r\n      regulated companies, the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in\r\n      other corporations, and entitled the person who had served his time to a\r\n      member of the company, to become himself a member, either without paying\r\n      any fine, or upon paying a much smaller one than what was exacted of other\r\n      people. The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain\r\n      it, prevails in all regulated companies. When they have been allowed to\r\n      act according to their natural genius, they have always, in order to\r\n      confine the competition to as small a number of persons as possible,\r\n      endeavoured to subject the trade to many burdensome regulations. When the\r\n      law has restrained them from doing this, they have become altogether\r\n      useless and insignificant.\r\n\r\n      The regulated companies for foreign commerce which at present subsist in\r\n      Great Britain, are the ancient merchant-adventurers company, now commonly\r\n      called the Hamburgh company, the Russia company, the Eastland company, the\r\n      Turkey company, and the African company.\r\n\r\n      The terms of admission into the Hamburgh company are now said to be quite\r\n      easy; and the directors either have it not in their power to subject the\r\n      trade to any troublesome restraint or regulations, or, at least, have not\r\n      of late exercised that power. It has not always been so. About the middle\r\n      of the last century, the fine for admission was fifty, and at one time one\r\n      hundred pounds, and the conduct of the company was said to be extremely\r\n      oppressive. In 1643, in 1645, and in 1661, the clothiers and free traders\r\n      of the west of England complained of them to parliament, as of\r\n      monopolists, who confined the trade, and oppressed the manufactures of the\r\n      country. Though those complaints produced no act of parliament, they had\r\n      probably intimidated the company so far, as to oblige them to reform their\r\n      conduct. Since that time, at least, there have been no complaints against\r\n      them. By the 10th and 11th of William III. c.6, the fine for admission\r\n      into the Russia company was reduced to five pounds; and by the 25th of\r\n      Charles II. c.7, that for admission into the Eastland company to forty\r\n      shillings; while, at the same time, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, all the\r\n      countries on the north side of the Baltic, were exempted from their\r\n      exclusive charter. The conduct of those companies had probably given\r\n      occasion to those two acts of parliament. Before that time, Sir Josiah\r\n      Child had represented both these and the Hamburgh company as extremely\r\n      oppressive, and imputed to their bad management the low state of the\r\n      trade, which we at that time carried on to the countries comprehended\r\n      within their respective charters. But though such companies may not, in\r\n      the present times, be very oppressive, they are certainly altogether\r\n      useless. To be merely useless, indeed, is perhaps, the highest eulogy\r\n      which can ever justly be bestowed upon a regulated company; and all the\r\n      three companies above mentioned seem, in their present state, to deserve\r\n      this eulogy.\r\n\r\n      The fine for admission into the Turkey company was formerly twenty-five\r\n      pounds for all persons under twenty-six years of age, and fifty pounds for\r\n      all persons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be admitted; a\r\n      restriction which excluded all shop-keepers and retailers. By a bye-law,\r\n      no British manufactures could be exported to Turkey but in the general\r\n      ships of the company; and as those ships sailed always from the port of\r\n      London, this restriction confined the trade to that expensive port, and\r\n      the traders to those who lived in London and in its neighbourhood. By\r\n      another bye-law, no person living within twenty miles of London, and not\r\n      free of the city, could be admitted a member; another restriction which,\r\n      joined to the foregoing, necessarily excluded all but the freemen of\r\n      London. As the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships\r\n      depended altogether upon the directors, they could easily fill them with\r\n      their own goods, and those of their particular friends, to the exclusion\r\n      of others, who, they might pretend, had made their proposals too late. In\r\n      this state of things, therefore, this company was, in every respect, a\r\n      strict and oppressive monopoly. Those abuses gave occasion to the act of\r\n      the 26th of George II. c. 18, reducing the fine for admission to twenty\r\n      pounds for all persons, without any distinction of ages, or any\r\n      restriction, either to mere merchants, or to the freemen of London; and\r\n      granting to all such persons the liberty of exporting, from all the ports\r\n      of Great Britain, to any port in Turkey, all British goods, of which the\r\n      exportation was not prohibited, upon paying both the general duties of\r\n      customs, and the particular duties assessed for defraying the necessary\r\n      expenses of the company; and submitting, at the same time, to the lawful\r\n      authority of the British ambassador and consuls resident in Turkey, and to\r\n      the bye-laws of the company duly enacted. To prevent any oppression by\r\n      those bye-laws, it was by the same act ordained, that if any seven members\r\n      of the company conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which should\r\n      be enacted after the passing of this act, they might appeal to the board\r\n      of trade and plantations (to the authority of which a committee of the\r\n      privy council has now succeeded), provided such appeal was brought within\r\n      twelve months after the bye-law was enacted; and that, if any seven\r\n      members conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been\r\n      enacted before the passing of this act, they might bring a like appeal,\r\n      provided it was within twelve months after the day on which this act was\r\n      to take place. The experience of one year, however, may not always be\r\n      sufficient to discover to all the members of a great company the\r\n      pernicious tendency of a particular bye-law; and if several of them should\r\n      afterwards discover it, neither the board of trade, nor the committee of\r\n      council, can afford them any redress. The object, besides, of the greater\r\n      part of the bye-laws of all regulated companies, as well as of all other\r\n      corporations, is not so much to oppress those who are already members, as\r\n      to discourage others from becoming so; which may be done, not only by a\r\n      high fine, but by many other contrivances. The constant view of such\r\n      companies is always to raise the rate of their own profit as high as they\r\n      can; to keep the market, both for the goods which they export, and for\r\n      those which they import, as much understocked as they can; which can be\r\n      done only by restraining the competition, or by discouraging new\r\n      adventurers from entering into the trade. A fine, even of twenty pounds,\r\n      besides, though it may not, perhaps, be sufficient to discourage any man\r\n      from entering into the Turkey trade, with an intention to continue in it,\r\n      may be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from hazarding a single\r\n      adventure in it. In all trades, the regular established traders, even\r\n      though not incorporated, naturally combine to raise profits, which are\r\n      noway so likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper level, as\r\n      by the occasional competition of speculative adventurers. The Turkey\r\n      trade, though in some measure laid open by this act of parliament, is\r\n      still considered by many people as very far from being altogether free.\r\n      The Turkey company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or three\r\n      consuls, who, like other public ministers, ought to be maintained\r\n      altogether by the state, and the trade laid open to all his majesty’s\r\n      subjects. The different taxes levied by the company, for this and other\r\n      corporation purposes, might afford a revenue much more than sufficient to\r\n      enable a state to maintain such ministers.\r\n\r\n      Regulated companies, it was observed by Sir Josiah Child, though they had\r\n      frequently supported public ministers, had never maintained any forts or\r\n      garrisons in the countries to which they traded; whereas joint-stock\r\n      companies frequently had. And, in reality, the former seem to be much more\r\n      unfit for this sort of service than the latter. First, the directors of a\r\n      regulated company have no particular interest in the prosperity of the\r\n      general trade of the company, for the sake of which such forts and\r\n      garrisons are maintained. The decay of that general trade may even\r\n      frequently contribute to the advantage of their own private trade; as, by\r\n      diminishing the number of their competitors, it may enable them both to\r\n      buy cheaper, and to sell dearer. The directors of a joint-stock company,\r\n      on the contrary, having only their share in the profits which are made\r\n      upon the common stock committed to their management, have no private trade\r\n      of their own, of which the interest can be separated from that of the\r\n      general trade of the company. Their private interest is connected with the\r\n      prosperity of the general trade of the company, and with the maintenance\r\n      of the forts and garrisons which are necessary for its defence. They are\r\n      more likely, therefore, to have that continual and careful attention which\r\n      that maintenance necessarily requires. Secondly, The directors of a\r\n      joint-stock company have always the management of a large capital, the\r\n      joint stock of the company, a part of which they may frequently employ,\r\n      with propriety, in building, repairing, and maintaining such necessary\r\n      forts and garrisons. But the directors of a regulated company, having the\r\n      management of no common capital, have no other fund to employ in this way,\r\n      but the casual revenue arising from the admission fines, and from the\r\n      corporation duties imposed upon the trade of the company. Though they had\r\n      the same interest, therefore, to attend to the maintenance of such forts\r\n      and garrisons, they can seldom have the same ability to render that\r\n      attention effectual. The maintenance of a public minister, requiring\r\n      scarce any attention, and but a moderate and limited expense, is a\r\n      business much more suitable both to the temper and abilities of a\r\n      regulated company.\r\n\r\n      Long after the time of Sir Josiah Child, however, in 1750, a regulated\r\n      company was established, the present company of merchants trading to\r\n      Africa; which was expressly charged at first with the maintenance of all\r\n      the British forts and garrisons that lie between Cape Blanc and the Cape\r\n      of Good Hope, and afterwards with that of those only which lie between\r\n      Cape Rouge and the Cape of Good Hope. The act which establishes this\r\n      company (the 23rd of George II. c.51 ), seems to have had two distinct\r\n      objects in view; first, to restrain effectually the oppressive and\r\n      monopolizing spirit which is natural to the directors of a regulated\r\n      company; and, secondly, to force them, as much as possible, to give an\r\n      attention, which is not natural to them, towards the maintenance of forts\r\n      and garrisons.\r\n\r\n      For the first of these purposes, the fine for admission is limited to\r\n      forty shillings. The company is prohibited from trading in their corporate\r\n      capacity, or upon a joint stock; from borrowing money upon common seal, or\r\n      from laying any restraints upon the trade, which may be carried on freely\r\n      from all places, and by all persons being British subjects, and paying the\r\n      fine. The government is in a committee of nine persons, who meet at\r\n      London, but who are chosen annually by the freemen of the company at\r\n      London, Bristol, and Liverpool; three from each place. No committeeman can\r\n      be continued in office for more than three years together. Any\r\n      committee-man might be removed by the board of trade and plantations, now\r\n      by a committee of council, after being heard in his own defence. The\r\n      committee are forbid to export negroes from Africa, or to import any\r\n      African goods into Great Britain. But as they are charged with the\r\n      maintenance of forts and garrisons, they may, for that purpose export from\r\n      Great Britain to Africa goods and stores of different kinds. Out of the\r\n      moneys which they shall receive from the company, they are allowed a sum,\r\n      not exceeding eight hundred pounds, for the salaries of their clerks and\r\n      agents at London, Bristol, and Liverpool, the house-rent of their offices\r\n      at London, and all other expenses of management, commission, and agency,\r\n      in England. What remains of this sum, after defraying these different\r\n      expenses, they may divide among themselves, as compensation for their\r\n      trouble, in what manner they think proper. By this constitution, it might\r\n      have been expected, that the spirit of monopoly would have been\r\n      effectually restrained, and the first of these purposes sufficiently\r\n      answered. It would seem, however, that it had not. Though by the 4th of\r\n      George III. c.20, the fort of Senegal, with all its dependencies, had been\r\n      invested in the company of merchants trading to Africa, yet, in the year\r\n      following (by the 5th of George III. c.44), not only Senegal and its\r\n      dependencies, but the whole coast, from the port of Sallee, in South\r\n      Barbary, to Cape Rouge, was exempted from the jurisdiction of that\r\n      company, was vested in the crown, and the trade to it declared free to all\r\n      his majesty’s subjects. The company had been suspected of restraining the\r\n      trade and of establishing some sort of improper monopoly. It is not,\r\n      however, very easy to conceive how, under the regulations of the 23d\r\n      George II. they could do so. In the printed debates of the house of\r\n      commons, not always the most authentic records of truth, I observe,\r\n      however, that they have been accused of this. The members of the committee\r\n      of nine being all merchants, and the governors and factors in their\r\n      different forts and settlements being all dependent upon them, it is not\r\n      unlikely that the latter might have given peculiar attention to the\r\n      consignments and commissions of the former, which would establish a real\r\n      monopoly.\r\n\r\n      For the second of these purposes, the maintenance of the forts and\r\n      garrisons, an annual sum has been allotted to them by parliament,\r\n      generally about £13,000. For the proper application of this sum, the\r\n      committee is obliged to account annually to the cursitor baron of\r\n      exchequer; which account is afterwards to be laid before parliament. But\r\n      parliament, which gives so little attention to the application of\r\n      millions, is not likely to give much to that of £13,000 a-year; and the\r\n      cursitor baron of exchequer, from his profession and education, is not\r\n      likely to be profoundly skilled in the proper expense of forts and\r\n      garrisons. The captains of his majesty’s navy, indeed, or any other\r\n      commissioned officers, appointed by the board of admiralty, may inquire\r\n      into the condition of the forts and garrisons, and report their\r\n      observations to that board. But that board seems to have no direct\r\n      jurisdiction over the committee, nor any authority to correct those whose\r\n      conduct it may thus inquire into; and the captains of his majesty’s navy,\r\n      besides, are not supposed to be always deeply learned in the science of\r\n      fortification. Removal from an office, which can be enjoyed only for the\r\n      term of three years, and of which the lawful emoluments, even during that\r\n      term, are so very small, seems to be the utmost punishment to which any\r\n      committee-man is liable, for any fault, except direct malversation, or\r\n      embezzlement, either of the public money, or of that of the company; and\r\n      the fear of the punishment can never be a motive of sufficient weight to\r\n      force a continual and careful attention to a business to which he has no\r\n      other interest to attend. The committee are accused of having sent out\r\n      bricks and stones from England for the reparation of Cape Coast Castle, on\r\n      the coast of Guinea; a business for which parliament had several times\r\n      granted an extraordinary sum of money. These bricks and stones, too, which\r\n      had thus been sent upon so long a voyage, were said to have been of so bad\r\n      a quality, that it was necessary to rebuild, from the foundation, the\r\n      walls which had been repaired with them. The forts and garrisons which lie\r\n      north of Cape Rouge, are not only maintained at the expense of the state,\r\n      but are under the immediate government of the executive power; and why\r\n      those which lie south of that cape, and which, too, are, in part at least,\r\n      maintained at the expense of the state, should be under a different\r\n      government, it seems not very easy even to imagine a good reason. The\r\n      protection of the Mediterranean trade was the original purpose or pretence\r\n      of the garrisons of Gibraltar and Minorca; and the maintenance and\r\n      government of those garrisons have always been, very properly, committed,\r\n      not to the Turkey company, but to the executive power. In the extent of\r\n      its dominion consists, in a great measure, the pride and dignity of that\r\n      power; and it is not very likely to fail in attention to what is necessary\r\n      for the defence of that dominion. The garrisons at Gibraltar and Minorca,\r\n      accordingly, have never been neglected. Though Minorca has been twice\r\n      taken, and is now probably lost for ever, that disaster has never been\r\n      imputed to any neglect in the executive power. I would not, however, be\r\n      understood to insinuate, that either of those expensive garrisons was\r\n      ever, even in the smallest degree, necessary for the purpose for which\r\n      they were originally dismembered from the Spanish monarchy. That\r\n      dismemberment, perhaps, never served any other real purpose than to\r\n      alienate from England her natural ally the king of Spain, and to unite the\r\n      two principal branches of the house of Bourbon in a much stricter and more\r\n      permanent alliance than the ties of blood could ever have united them.\r\n\r\n      Joint-stock companies, established either by royal charter, or by act of\r\n      parliament, are different in several respects, not only from regulated\r\n      companies, but from private copartneries.\r\n\r\n      First, In a private copartnery, no partner without the consent of the\r\n      company, can transfer his share to another person, or introduce a new\r\n      member into the company. Each member, however, may, upon proper warning,\r\n      withdraw from the copartnery, and demand payment from them of his share of\r\n      the common stock. In a joint-stock company, on the contrary, no member can\r\n      demand payment of his share from the company; but each member can, without\r\n      their consent, transfer his share to another person, and thereby introduce\r\n      a new member. The value of a share in a joint stock is always the price\r\n      which it will bring in the market; and this may be either greater or less\r\n      in any proportion, than the sum which its owner stands credited for in the\r\n      stock of the company.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, In a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts\r\n      contracted by the company, to the whole extent of his fortune. In a\r\n      joint-stock company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the\r\n      extent of his share.\r\n\r\n      The trade of a joint-stock company is always managed by a court of\r\n      directors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to\r\n      the control of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part of\r\n      these proprietors seldom pretend to understand any thing of the business\r\n      of the company; and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail\r\n      among them, give themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly\r\n      such halfyearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make\r\n      to them. This total exemption front trouble and front risk, beyond a\r\n      limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint-stock\r\n      companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any\r\n      private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves\r\n      much greater stocks, than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading\r\n      stock of the South Sea company at one time amounted to upwards of\r\n      thirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds. The divided capital\r\n      of the Bank of England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred\r\n      and eighty thousand pounds. The directors of such companies, however,\r\n      being the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own, it\r\n      cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same\r\n      anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery\r\n      frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are\r\n      apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master’s\r\n      honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it.\r\n      Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in\r\n      the management of the affairs of such a company. It is upon this account,\r\n      that joint-stock companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to\r\n      maintain the competition against private adventurers. They have,\r\n      accordingly, very seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege; and\r\n      frequently have not succeeded with one. Without an exclusive privilege,\r\n      they have commonly mismanaged the trade. With an exclusive privilege, they\r\n      have both mismanaged and confined it.\r\n\r\n      The Royal African company, the predecessors of the present African\r\n      company, had an exclusive privilege by charter; but as that charter had\r\n      not been confirmed by act of parliament, the trade, in consequence of the\r\n      declaration of rights, was, soon after the Revolution, laid open to all\r\n      his majesty’s subjects. The Hudson’s Bay company are, as to their legal\r\n      rights, in the same situation as the Royal African company. Their\r\n      exclusive charter has not been confirmed by act of parliament. The South\r\n      Sea company, as long as they continued to be a trading company, had an\r\n      exclusive privilege confirmed by act of parliament; as have likewise the\r\n      present united company of merchants trading to the East Indies.\r\n\r\n      The Royal African company soon found that they could not maintain the\r\n      competition against private adventurers, whom, notwithstanding the\r\n      declaration of rights, they continued for some time to call interlopers,\r\n      and to persecute as such. In 1698, however, the private adventurers were\r\n      subjected to a duty of ten per cent. upon almost all the different\r\n      branches of their trade, to be employed by the company in the maintenance\r\n      of their forts and garrisons. But, notwithstanding this heavy tax, the\r\n      company were still unable to maintain the competition. Their stock and\r\n      credit gradually declined. In 1712, their debts had become so great, that\r\n      a particular act of parliament was thought necessary, both for their\r\n      security and for that of their creditors. It was enacted, that the\r\n      resolution of two-thirds of these creditors in number and value should\r\n      bind the rust, both with regard to the time which should be allowed to the\r\n      company for the payment of their debts, and with regard to any other\r\n      agreement which it might be thought proper to make with them concerning\r\n      those debts. In 1730, their affairs were in so great disorder, that they\r\n      were altogether incapable of maintaining their forts and garrisons, the\r\n      sole purpose and pretext of their institution. From that year till their\r\n      final dissolution, the parliament judged it necessary to allow the annual\r\n      sum of £10,000 for that purpose. In 1732, after having been for many years\r\n      losers by the trade of carrying negroes to the West Indies, they at last\r\n      resolved to give it up altogether; to sell to the private traders to\r\n      America the negroes which they purchased upon the coast; and to employ\r\n      their servants in a trade to the inland parts of Africa for gold dust,\r\n      elephants teeth, dyeing drugs, etc. But their success in this more\r\n      confined trade was not greater than in their former extensive one. Their\r\n      affairs continued to go gradually to decline, till at last, being in every\r\n      respect a bankrupt company, they were dissolved by act of parliament, and\r\n      their forts and garrisons vested in the present regulated company of\r\n      merchants trading to Africa. Before the erection of the Royal African\r\n      company, there had been three other joint-stock companies successively\r\n      established, one after another, for the African trade. They were all\r\n      equally unsuccessful. They all, however, had exclusive charters, which,\r\n      though not confirmed by act of parliament, were in those days supposed to\r\n      convey a real exclusive privilege.\r\n\r\n      The Hudson’s Bay company, before their misfortunes in the late war, had\r\n      been much more fortunate than the Royal African company. Their necessary\r\n      expense is much smaller. The whole number of people whom they maintain in\r\n      their different settlements and habitations, which they have honoured with\r\n      the name of forts, is said not to exceed a hundred and twenty persons.\r\n      This number, however, is sufficient to prepare beforehand the cargo of\r\n      furs and other goods necessary for loading their ships, which, on account\r\n      of the ice, can seldom remain above six or eight weeks in those seas. This\r\n      advantage of having a cargo ready prepared, could not, for several years,\r\n      be acquired by private adventurers; and without it there seems to be no\r\n      possibility of trading to Hudson’s Bay. The moderate capital of the\r\n      company, which, it is said, does not exceed one hundred and ten thousand\r\n      pounds, may, besides, be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole,\r\n      or almost the whole trade and surplus produce, of the miserable though\r\n      extensive country comprehended within their charter. No private\r\n      adventurers, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country in\r\n      competition with them. This company, therefore, have always enjoyed an\r\n      exclusive trade, in fact, though they may have no right to it in law. Over\r\n      and above all this, the moderate capital of this company is said to be\r\n      divided among a very small number of proprietors. But a joint-stock\r\n      company, consisting of a small number of proprietors, with a moderate\r\n      capital, approaches very nearly to the nature of a private copartnery, and\r\n      may be capable of nearly the same degree of vigilance and attention. It is\r\n      not to be wondered at, therefore, if, in consequence of these different\r\n      advantages, the Hudson’s Bay company had, before the late war, been able\r\n      to carry on their trade with a considerable degree of success. It does not\r\n      seem probable, however, that their profits ever approached to what the\r\n      late Mr Dobbs imagined them. A much more sober and judicious writer, Mr\r\n      Anderson, author of the Historical and Chronological Deduction of\r\n      Commerce, very justly observes, that upon examining the accounts which Mr\r\n      Dobbs himself has given for several years together, of their exports and\r\n      imports, and upon making proper allowances for their extraordinary risk\r\n      and expense, it does not appear that their profits deserve to be envied,\r\n      or that they can much, if at all, exceed the ordinary profits of trade.\r\n\r\n      The South Sea company never had any forts or garrisons to maintain, and\r\n      therefore were entirely exempted from one great expense, to which other\r\n      joint-stock companies for foreign trade are subject; but they had an\r\n      immense capital divided among an immense number of proprietors. It was\r\n      naturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and\r\n      profusion, should prevail in the whole management of their affairs. The\r\n      knavery and extravagance of their stock-jobbing projects are sufficiently\r\n      known, and the explication of them would be foreign to the present\r\n      subject. Their mercantile projects were not much better conducted. The\r\n      first trade which they engaged in, was that of supplying the Spanish West\r\n      Indies with negroes, of which (in consequence of what was called the\r\n      Assiento Contract granted them by the treaty of Utrecht) they had the\r\n      exclusive privilege. But as it was not expected that much profit could be\r\n      made by this trade, both the Portuguese and French companies, who had\r\n      enjoyed it upon the same terms before them, having been ruined by it, they\r\n      were allowed, as compensation, to send annually a ship of a certain\r\n      burden, to trade directly to the Spanish West Indies. Of the ten voyages\r\n      which this annual ship was allowed to make, they are said to have gained\r\n      considerably by one, that of the Royal Caroline, in 1731; and to have been\r\n      losers, more or less, by almost all the rest. Their ill success was\r\n      imputed, by their factors and agents, to the extortion and oppression of\r\n      the Spanish government; but was, perhaps, principally owing to the\r\n      profusion and depredations of those very factors and agents; some of whom\r\n      are said to have acquired great fortunes, even in one year. In 1734, the\r\n      company petitioned the king, that they might be allowed to dispose of the\r\n      trade and tonnage of their annual ship, on account of the little profit\r\n      which they made by it, and to accept of such equivalent as they could\r\n      obtain from the king of Spain.\r\n\r\n      In 1724, this company had undertaken the whale fishery. Of this, indeed,\r\n      they had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other British\r\n      subjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages which their\r\n      ships made to Greenland, they were gainers by one, and losers by all the\r\n      rest. After their eighth and last voyage, when they had sold their ships,\r\n      stores, and utensils, they found that their whole loss upon this branch,\r\n      capital and interest included, amounted to upwards of £237,000.\r\n\r\n      In 1722, this company petitioned the parliament to be allowed to divide\r\n      their immense capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hundred\r\n      thousand pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government, into two\r\n      equal parts; the one half, or upwards of £16,900,000, to be put upon the\r\n      same footing with other government annuities, and not to be subject to the\r\n      debts contracted, or losses incurred, by the directors of the company, in\r\n      the prosecution of their mercantile projects; the other half to remain as\r\n      before, a trading stock, and to be subject to those debts and losses. The\r\n      petition was too reasonable not to be granted. In 1733, they again\r\n      petitioned the parliament, that three-fourths of their trading stock might\r\n      be turned into annuity stock, and only one-fourth remain as trading stock,\r\n      or exposed to the hazards arising from the bad management of their\r\n      directors. Both their annuity and trading stocks had, by this time, been\r\n      reduced more than two millions each, by several different payments from\r\n      government; so that this fourth amounted only to £3,662,784:8:6. In 1748,\r\n      all the demands of the company upon the king of Spain, in consequence of\r\n      the assiento contract, were, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, given up\r\n      for what was supposed an equivalent. An end was put to their trade with\r\n      the Spanish West Indies; the remainder of their trading stock was turned\r\n      into an annuity stock; and the company ceased, in every respect, to be a\r\n      trading company.\r\n\r\n      It ought to be observed, that in the trade which the South Sea company\r\n      carried on by means of their annual ship, the only trade by which it ever\r\n      was expected that they could make any considerable profit, they were not\r\n      without competitors, either in the foreign or in the home market. At\r\n      Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to encounter the\r\n      competition of the Spanish merchants, who brought from Cadiz to those\r\n      markets European goods, of the same kind with the outward cargo of their\r\n      ship; and in England they had to encounter that of the English merchants,\r\n      who imported from Cadiz goods of the Spanish West Indies, of the same kind\r\n      with the inward cargo. The goods, both of the Spanish and English\r\n      merchants, indeed, were, perhaps, subject to higher duties. But the loss\r\n      occasioned by the negligence, profusion, and malversation of the servants\r\n      of the company, had probably been a tax much heavier than all those\r\n      duties. That a joint-stock company should be able to carry on successfully\r\n      any branch of foreign trade, when private adventurers can come into any\r\n      sort of open and fair competition with them, seems contrary to all\r\n      experience.\r\n\r\n      The old English East India company was established in 1600, by a charter\r\n      from Queen Elizabeth. In the first twelve voyages which they fitted out\r\n      for India, they appear to have traded as a regulated company, with\r\n      separate stocks, though only in the general ships of the company. In 1612,\r\n      they united into a joint stock. Their charter was exclusive, and, though\r\n      not confirmed by act of parliament, was in those days supposed to convey a\r\n      real exclusive privilege. For many years, therefore, they were not much\r\n      disturbed by interlopers. Their capital, which never exceeded £744,000,\r\n      and of which £50 was a share, was not so exorbitant, nor their dealings so\r\n      extensive, as to afford either a pretext for gross negligence and\r\n      profusion, or a cover to gross malversation. Notwithstanding some\r\n      extraordinary losses, occasioned partly by the malice of the Dutch East\r\n      India company, and partly by other accidents, they carried on for many\r\n      years a successful trade. But in process of time, when the principles of\r\n      liberty were better understood, it became every day more and more\r\n      doubtful, how far a royal charter, not confirmed by act of parliament,\r\n      could convey an exclusive privilege. Upon this question the decisions of\r\n      the courts of justice were not uniform, but varied with the authority of\r\n      government, and the humours of the times. Interlopers multiplied upon\r\n      them; and towards the end of the reign of Charles II., through the whole\r\n      of that of James II., and during a part of that of William III., reduced\r\n      them to great distress. In 1698, a proposal was made to parliament, of\r\n      advancing two millions to government, at eight per cent. provided the\r\n      subscribers were erected into a new East India company, with exclusive\r\n      privileges. The old East India company offered seven hundred thousand\r\n      pounds, nearly the amount of their capital, at four per cent. upon the\r\n      same conditions. But such was at that time the state of public credit,\r\n      that it was more convenient for government to borrow two millions at eight\r\n      per cent. than seven hundred thousand pounds at four. The proposal of the\r\n      new subscribers was accepted, and a new East India company established in\r\n      consequence. The old East India company, however, had a right to continue\r\n      their trade till 1701. They had, at the same time, in the name of their\r\n      treasurer, subscribed very artfully three hundred and fifteen thousand\r\n      pounds into the stock of the new. By a negligence in the expression of the\r\n      act of parliament, which vested the East India trade in the subscribers to\r\n      this loan of two millions, it did not appear evident that they were all\r\n      obliged to unite into a joint stock. A few private traders, whose\r\n      subscriptions amounted only to seven thousand two hundred pounds, insisted\r\n      upon the privilege of trading separately upon their own stocks, and at\r\n      their own risks. The old East India company had a right to a separate\r\n      trade upon their own stock till 1701; and they had likewise, both before\r\n      and after that period, a right, like that or other private traders, to a\r\n      separate trade upon the £315,000, which they had subscribed into the stock\r\n      of the new company. The competition of the two companies with the private\r\n      traders, and with one another, is said to have well nigh ruined both. Upon\r\n      a subsequent occasion, in 1750, when a proposal was made to parliament for\r\n      putting the trade under the management of a regulated company, and thereby\r\n      laying it in some measure open, the East India company, in opposition to\r\n      this proposal, represented, in very strong terms, what had been, at this\r\n      time, the miserable effects, as they thought them, of this competition. In\r\n      India, they said, it raised the price of goods so high, that they were not\r\n      worth the buying; and in England, by overstocking the market, it sunk\r\n      their price so low, that no profit could be made by them. That by a more\r\n      plentiful supply, to the great advantage and conveniency of the public, it\r\n      must have reduced very much the price of India goods in the English\r\n      market, cannot well be doubted; but that it should have raised very much\r\n      their price in the Indian market, seems not very probable, as all the\r\n      extraordinary demand which that competition could occasion must have been\r\n      but as a drop of water in the immense ocean of Indian commerce. The\r\n      increase of demand, besides, though in the beginning it may sometimes\r\n      raise the price of goods, never fails to lower it in the long-run. It\r\n      encourages production, and thereby increases the competition of the\r\n      producers, who, in order to undersell one another, have recourse to new\r\n      divisions or labour and new improvements of art, which might never\r\n      otherwise have been thought of. The miserable effects of which the company\r\n      complained, were the cheapness of consumption, and the encouragement given\r\n      to production; precisely the two effects which it is the great business of\r\n      political economy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave\r\n      this doleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In\r\n      1702, the two companies were, in some measure, united by an indenture\r\n      tripartite, to which the queen was the third party; and in 1708, they were\r\n      by act of parliament, perfectly consolidated into one company, by their\r\n      present name of the United Company of Merchants trading to the East\r\n      Indies. Into this act it was thought worth while to insert a clause,\r\n      allowing the separate traders to continue their trade till Michaelmas\r\n      1711; but at the same time empowering the directors, upon three years\r\n      notice, to redeem their little capital of seven thousand two hundred\r\n      pounds, and thereby to convert the whole stock of the company into a joint\r\n      stock. By the same act, the capital of the company, in consequence of a\r\n      new loan to government, was augmented from two millions to three millions\r\n      two hundred thousand pounds. In 1743, the company advanced another million\r\n      to government. But this million being raised, not by a call upon the\r\n      proprietors, but by selling annuities and contracting bond-debts, it did\r\n      not augment the stock upon which the proprietors could claim a dividend.\r\n      It augmented, however, their trading stock, it being equally liable with\r\n      the other three millions two hundred thousand pounds, to the losses\r\n      sustained, and debts contracted by the company in prosecution of their\r\n      mercantile projects. From 1708, or at least from 1711, this company, being\r\n      delivered from all competitors, and fully established in the monopoly of\r\n      the English commerce to the East Indies, carried on a successful trade,\r\n      and from their profits, made annually a moderate dividend to their\r\n      proprietors. During the French war, which began in 1741, the ambition of\r\n      Mr Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, involved them in the wars\r\n      of the Carnatic, and in the politics of the Indian princes. After many\r\n      signal successes, and equally signal losses, they at last lost Madras, at\r\n      that time their principal settlement in India. It was restored to them by\r\n      the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and, about this time the spirit of war and\r\n      conquest seems to have taken possession of their servants in India, and\r\n      never since to have left them. During the French war, which began in 1755,\r\n      their arms partook of the general good fortune of those of Great Britain.\r\n      They defended Madras, took Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta, and acquired\r\n      the revenues of a rich and extensive territory, amounting, it was then\r\n      said, to upwards of three millions a-year. They remained for several years\r\n      in quiet possession of this revenue; but in 1767, administration laid\r\n      claim to their territorial acquisitions, and the revenue arising from\r\n      them, as of right belonging to the crown; and the company, in compensation\r\n      for this claim, agreed to pay to government £400,000 a-year. They had,\r\n      before this, gradually augmented their dividend from about six to ten per\r\n      cent.; that is, upon their capital of three millions two hundred thousand\r\n      pounds, they had increased it by £128,000, or had raised it from one\r\n      hundred and ninety-two thousand to three hundred and twenty thousand\r\n      pounds a-year. They were attempting about this time to raise it still\r\n      further, to twelve and a-half per cent., which would have made their\r\n      annual payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay\r\n      annually to government, or to £400,000 a-year. But during the two years in\r\n      which their agreement with government was to take place, they were\r\n      restrained from any further increase of dividend by two successive acts of\r\n      parliament, of which the object was to enable them to make a speedier\r\n      progress in the payment of their debts, which were at this time estimated\r\n      at upwards of six or seven millions sterling. In 1769, they renewed their\r\n      agreement with government for five years more, and stipulated, that during\r\n      the course of that period, they should be allowed gradually to increase\r\n      their dividend to twelve and a-half per cent; never increasing it,\r\n      however, more than one per cent. in one year. This increase of dividend,\r\n      therefore, when it had risen to its utmost height, could augment their\r\n      annual payments, to their proprietors and government together, but by\r\n      £680,000, beyond what they had been before their late territorial\r\n      acquisitions. What the gross revenue of those territorial acquisitions was\r\n      supposed to amount to, has already been mentioned; and by an account\r\n      brought by the Cruttenden East Indiaman in 1769, the neat revenue, clear\r\n      of all deductions and military charges, was stated at two millions\r\n      forty-eight thousand seven hundred and forty-seven pounds. They were said,\r\n      at the same time, to possess another revenue, arising partly from lands,\r\n      but chiefly from the customs established at their different settlements,\r\n      amounting to £439,000. The profits of their trade, too, according to the\r\n      evidence of their chairman before the house of commons, amounted, at this\r\n      time, to at least £400,000 a-year; according to that of their accountant,\r\n      to at least £500,000; according to the lowest account, at least equal to\r\n      the highest dividend that was to be paid to their proprietors. So great a\r\n      revenue might certainly have afforded an augmentation of £680,000 in their\r\n      annual payments; and, at the same time, have left a large sinking fund,\r\n      sufficient for the speedy reduction of their debt. In 1773, however, their\r\n      debts, instead of being reduced, were augmented by an arrear to the\r\n      treasury in the payment of the four hundred thousand pounds; by another to\r\n      the custom-house for duties unpaid; by a large debt to the bank, for money\r\n      borrowed; and by a fourth, for bills drawn upon them from India, and\r\n      wantonly accepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thousand\r\n      pounds. The distress which these accumulated claims brought upon them,\r\n      obliged them not only to reduce all at once their dividend to six per\r\n      cent. but to throw themselves upon the mercy of govermnent, and to\r\n      supplicate, first, a release from the further payment of the stipulated\r\n      £400,000 a-year; and, secondly, a loan of fourteen hundred thousand, to\r\n      save them from immediate bankruptcy. The great increase of their fortune\r\n      had, it seems, only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for\r\n      greater profusion, and a cover for greater malversation, than in\r\n      proportion even to that increase of fortune. The conduct of their servants\r\n      in India, and the general state of their affairs both in India and in\r\n      Europe, became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry: in consequence of\r\n      which, several very important alterations were made in the constitution of\r\n      their government, both at home and abroad. In India, their principal\r\n      settlements or Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, which had before been\r\n      altogether independent of one another, were subjected to a\r\n      governor-general, assisted by a council of four assessors, parliament\r\n      assuming to itself the first nomination of this governor and council, who\r\n      were to reside at Calcutta; that city having now become, what Madras was\r\n      before, the most important of the English settlements in India. The court\r\n      of the Mayor of Calcutta, originally instituted for the trial of\r\n      mercantile causes, which arose in the city and neighbourhood, had\r\n      gradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire. It\r\n      was now reduced and confined to the original purpose of its institution.\r\n      Instead of it, a new supreme court of judicature was established,\r\n      consisting of a chief justice and three judges, to be appointed by the\r\n      crown. In Europe, the qualification necessary to entitle a proprietor to\r\n      vote at their general courts was raised, from five hundred pounds, the\r\n      original price of a share in the stock of the company, to a thousand\r\n      pounds. In order to vote upon this qualification, too, it was declared\r\n      necessary, that he should have possessed it, if acquired by his own\r\n      purchase, and not by inheritance, for at least one year, instead of six\r\n      months, the term requisite before. The court of twenty-four directors had\r\n      before been chosen annually; but it was now enacted, that each director\r\n      should, for the future, be chosen for four years; six of them, however, to\r\n      go out of office by rotation every year, and not be capable of being\r\n      re-chosen at the election of the six new directors for the ensuing year.\r\n      In consequence of these alterations, the courts, both of the proprietors\r\n      and directors, it was expected, would be likely to act with more dignity\r\n      and steadiness than they had usually done before. But it seems impossible,\r\n      by any alterations, to render those courts, in any respect, fit to govern,\r\n      or even to share in the government of a great empire; because the greater\r\n      part of their members must always have too little interest in the\r\n      prosperity of that empire, to give any serious attention to what may\r\n      promote it. Frequently a man of great, sometimes even a man of small\r\n      fortune, is willing to purchase a thousand pounds share in India stock,\r\n      merely for the influence which he expects to aquire by a vote in the court\r\n      of proprietors. It gives him a share, though not in the plunder, yet in\r\n      the appointment of the plunderers of India; the court of directors, though\r\n      they make that appointment, being necessarily more or less under the\r\n      influence of the proprietors, who not only elect those directors, but\r\n      sometimes over-rule the appointments of their servants in India. Provided\r\n      he can enjoy this influence for a few years, and thereby provide for a\r\n      certain number of his friends, he frequently cares little about the\r\n      dividend, or even about the value of the stock upon which his vote is\r\n      founded. About the prosperity of the great empire, in the government of\r\n      which that vote gives him a share, he seldom cares at all. No other\r\n      sovereigns ever were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, so\r\n      perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects, the\r\n      improvement or waste of their dominions, the glory or disgrace of their\r\n      administration, as, from irresistible moral causes, the greater part of\r\n      the proprietors of such a mercantile company are, and necessarily must be.\r\n      This indifference, too, was more likely to be increased than diminished by\r\n      some of the new regulations which were made in consequence of the\r\n      parliamentary inquiry. By a resolution of the house of commons, for\r\n      example, it was declared, that when the £1,400,000 lent to the company by\r\n      government, should be paid, and their bond-debts be reduced to £1,500,000,\r\n      they might then, and not till then, divide eight per cent. upon their\r\n      capital; and that whatever remained of their revenues and neat profits at\r\n      home should be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the\r\n      exchequer for the use of the public, and the fourth to be reserved as a\r\n      fund, either for the further reduction of their bond-debts, or for the\r\n      discharge of other contingent exigencies which the company might labour\r\n      under. But if the company were bad stewards and bad sovereigns, when the\r\n      whole of their neat revenue and profits belonged to themselves, and were\r\n      at their own disposal, they were surely not likely to be better when\r\n      three-fourths of them were to belong to other people, and the other\r\n      fourth, though to be laid out for the benefit of the company, yet to be so\r\n      under the inspection and with the approbation of other people.\r\n\r\n      It might be more agreeable to the company, that their own servants and\r\n      dependants should have either the pleasure of wasting, or the profit of\r\n      embezzling, whatever surplus might remain, after paying the proposed\r\n      dividend of eight per cent. than that it should come into the hands of a\r\n      set of people with whom those resolutions could scarce fail to set them in\r\n      some measure at variance. The interest of those servants and dependants\r\n      might so far predominate in the court of proprietors, as sometimes to\r\n      dispose it to support the authors of depredations which had been committed\r\n      in direct violation of its own authority. With the majority of\r\n      proprietors, the support even of the authority of their own court might\r\n      sometimes be a matter of less consequence than the support of those who\r\n      had set that authority at defiance.\r\n\r\n      The regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the disorder\r\n      of the company’s government in India. Notwithstanding that, during a\r\n      momentary fit of good conduct, they had at one time collected into the\r\n      treasury of Calcutta more than £3,000,000 sterling; notwithstanding that\r\n      they had afterwards extended either their dominion or their depredations\r\n      over a vast accession of some of the richest and most fertile countries in\r\n      India, all was wasted and destroyed. They found themselves altogether\r\n      unprepared to stop or resist the incursion of Hyder Ali; and in\r\n      consequence of those disorders, the company is now (1784) in greater\r\n      distress than ever; and, in order to prevent immediate bankruptcy, is once\r\n      more reduced to supplicate the assistance of government. Different plans\r\n      have been proposed by the different parties in parliament for the better\r\n      management of its affairs; and all those plans seem to agree in supposing,\r\n      what was indeed always abundantly evident, that it is altogether unfit to\r\n      govern its territorial possessions. Even the company itself seems to be\r\n      convinced of its own incapacity so far, and seems, upon that account\r\n      willing to give them up to government.\r\n\r\n      With the right of possessing forts and garrisons in distant and barbarous\r\n      countries is necessarily connected the right of making peace and war in\r\n      those countries. The joint-stock companies, which have had the one right,\r\n      have constantly exercised the other, and have frequently had it expressly\r\n      conferred upon them. How unjustly, how capriciously, how cruelly, they\r\n      have commonly exercised it, is too well known from recent experience.\r\n\r\n      When a company of merchants undertake, at their own risk and expense, to\r\n      establish a new trade with some remote and barbarous nation, it may not be\r\n      unreasonable to incorporate them into a joint-stock company, and to grant\r\n      them, in case of their success, a monopoly of the trade for a certain\r\n      number of years. It is the easiest and most natural way in which the state\r\n      can recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive experiment, of\r\n      which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly\r\n      of this kind may be vindicated, upon the same principles upon which a like\r\n      monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of a new\r\n      book to its author. But upon the expiration of the term, the monopoly\r\n      ought certainly to determine; the forts and garrisons, if it was found\r\n      necessary to establish any, to be taken into the hands of government,\r\n      their value to be paid to the company, and the trade to be laid open to\r\n      all the subjects of the state. By a perpetual monopoly, all the other\r\n      subjects of the state are taxed very absurdly in two different ways:\r\n      first, by the high price of goods, which, in the case of a free trade,\r\n      they could buy much cheaper; and, secondly, by their total exclusion from\r\n      a branch of business which it might be both convenient and profitable for\r\n      many of them to carry on. It is for the most worthless of all purposes,\r\n      too, that they are taxed in this manner. It is merely to enable the\r\n      company to support the negligence, profusion, and malversation of their\r\n      own servants, whose disorderly conduct seldom allows the dividend of the\r\n      company to exceed the ordinary rate of profit in trades which are\r\n      altogether free, and very frequently makes a fall even a good deal short\r\n      of that rate. Without a monopoly, however, a joint-stock company, it would\r\n      appear from experience, cannot long carry on any branch of foreign trade.\r\n      To buy in one market, in order to sell with profit in another, when there\r\n      are many competitors in both; to watch over, not only the occasional\r\n      variations in the demand, but the much greater and more frequent\r\n      variations in the competition, or in the supply which that demand is\r\n      likely to get from other people; and to suit with dexterity and judgment\r\n      both the quantity and quality of each assortment of goods to all these\r\n      circumstances, is a species of warfare, of which the operations are\r\n      continually changing, and which can scarce ever be conducted successfully,\r\n      without such an unremitting exertion of vigilance and attention as cannot\r\n      long be expected from the directors of a joint-stock company. The East\r\n      India company, upon the redemption of their funds, and the expiration of\r\n      their exclusive privilege, have a right, by act of parliament, to continue\r\n      a corporation with a joint stock, and to trade in their corporate capacity\r\n      to the East Indies, in common with the rest of their fellow subjects. But\r\n      in this situation, the superior vigilance and attention of a private\r\n      adventurer would, in all probability, soon make them weary of the trade.\r\n\r\n      An eminent French author, of great knowledge in matters of political\r\n      economy, the Abbe Morellet, gives a list of fifty-five joint-stock\r\n      companies for foreign trade, which have been established in different\r\n      parts of Europe since the year 1600, and which, according to him, have all\r\n      failed from mismanagement, notwithstanding they had exclusive privileges.\r\n      He has been misinformed with regard to the history of two or three of\r\n      them, which were not joint-stock companies and have not failed. But, in\r\n      compensation, there have been several joint-stock companies which have\r\n      failed, and which he has omitted.\r\n\r\n      The only trades which it seems possible for a joint-stock company to carry\r\n      on successfully, without an exclusive privilege, are those, of which all\r\n      the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a routine,\r\n      or to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation. Of\r\n      this kind is, first, the banking trade; secondly, the trade of insurance\r\n      from fire and from sea risk, and capture in time of war; thirdly, the\r\n      trade of making and maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and, fourthly,\r\n      the similar trade of bringing water for the supply of a great city.\r\n\r\n      Though the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat abstruse,\r\n      the practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules. To depart upon\r\n      any occasion from those rules, in consequence of some flattering\r\n      speculation of extraordinary gain, is almost always extremely dangerous\r\n      and frequently fatal to the banking company which attempts it. But the\r\n      constitution of joint-stock companies renders them in general, more\r\n      tenacious of established rules than any private copartnery. Such\r\n      companies, therefore, seem extremely well fitted for this trade. The\r\n      principal banking companies in Europe, accordingly, are joint-stock\r\n      companies, many of which manage their trade very successfully without any\r\n      exclusive privilege. The bank of England has no other exclusive privilege,\r\n      except that no other banking company in England shall consist of more than\r\n      six persons. The two banks of Edinburgh are joint-stock companies, without\r\n      any exclusive privilege.\r\n\r\n      The value of the risk, either from fire, or from loss by sea, or by\r\n      capture, though it cannot, perhaps, be calculated very exactly, admits,\r\n      however, of such a gross estimation, as renders it, in some degree,\r\n      reducible to strict rule and method. The trade of insurance, therefore,\r\n      may be carried on successfully by a joint-stock company, without any\r\n      exclusive privilege. Neither the London Assurance, nor the Royal Exchange\r\n      Assurance companies have any such privilege.\r\n\r\n      When a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the management of it\r\n      becomes quite simple and easy, and it is reducible to strict rule and\r\n      method. Even the making of it is so, as it may be contracted for with\r\n      undertakers, at so much a mile, and so much a lock. The same thing may be\r\n      said of a canal, an aqueduct, or a great pipe for bringing water to supply\r\n      a great city. Such under-takings, therefore, may be, and accordingly\r\n      frequently are, very successfully managed by joint-stock companies,\r\n      without any exclusive privilege.\r\n\r\n      To establish a joint-stock company, however, for any undertaking, merely\r\n      because such a company might be capable of managing it successfully; or,\r\n      to exempt a particular set of dealers from some of the general laws which\r\n      take place with regard to all their neighbours, merely because they might\r\n      be capable of thriving, if they had such an exemption, would certainly not\r\n      be reasonable. To render such an establishment perfectly reasonable, with\r\n      the circumstance of being reducible to strict rule and method, two other\r\n      circumstances ought to concur. First, it ought to appear with the clearest\r\n      evidence, that the undertaking is of greater and more general utility than\r\n      the greater part of common trades; and, secondly, that it requires a\r\n      greater capital than can easily be collected into a private copartnery. If\r\n      a moderate capital were sufficient, the great utility of the undertaking\r\n      would not be a sufficient reason for establishing a joint-stock company;\r\n      because, in this case, the demand for what it was to produce, would\r\n      readily and easily be supplied by private adventurers. In the four trades\r\n      above mentioned, both those circumstances concur.\r\n\r\n      The great and general utility of the banking trade, when prudently\r\n      managed, has been fully explained in the second book of this Inquiry. But\r\n      a public bank, which is to support public credit, and, upon particular\r\n      emergencies, to advance to government the whole produce of a tax, to the\r\n      amount, perhaps, of several millions, a year or two before it comes in,\r\n      requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into any private\r\n      copartnery.\r\n\r\n      The trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private\r\n      people, and, by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin an\r\n      individual, makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society. In order\r\n      to give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers should\r\n      have a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two joint-stock\r\n      companies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was laid before the\r\n      attorney-general, of one hundred and fifty private usurers, who had failed\r\n      in the course of a few years.\r\n\r\n      That navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are sometimes\r\n      necessary for supplying a great city with water, are of great and general\r\n      utility, while, at the same time, they frequently require a greater\r\n      expense than suits the fortunes of private people, is sufficiently\r\n      obvious.\r\n\r\n      Except the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to recollect\r\n      any other, in which all the three circumstances requisite for rendering\r\n      reasonable the establishment of a joint-stock company concur. The English\r\n      copper company of London, the lead-smelting company, the glass-grinding\r\n      company, have not even the pretext of any great or singular utility in the\r\n      object which they pursue; nor does the pursuit of that object seem to\r\n      require any expense unsuitable to the fortunes of many private men.\r\n      Whether the trade which those companies carry on, is reducible to such\r\n      strict rule and method as to render it fit for the management of a\r\n      joint-stock company, or whether they have any reason to boast of their\r\n      extraordinary profits, I do not pretend to know. The mine-adventurers\r\n      company has been long ago bankrupt. A share in the stock of the British\r\n      Linen company of Edinburgh sells, at present, very much below par, though\r\n      less so than it did some years ago. The joint-stock companies, which are\r\n      established for the public-spirited purpose of promoting some particular\r\n      manufacture, over and above managing their own affairs ill, to the\r\n      diminution of the general stock of the society, can, in other respects,\r\n      scarce ever fail to do more harm than good. Notwithstanding the most\r\n      upright intentions, the unavoidable partiality of their directors to\r\n      particular branches of the manufacture, of which the undertakers mislead\r\n      and impose upon them, is a real discouragement to the rest, and\r\n      necessarily breaks, more or less, that natural proportion which would\r\n      otherwise establish itself between judicious industry and profit, and\r\n      which, to the general industry of the country, is of all encouragements\r\n      the greatest and the most effectual.\r\n\r\n      ART. II.—Of the Expense of the Institution for the Education of\r\n      Youth.\r\n\r\n      The institutions for the education of the youth may, in the same manner,\r\n      furnish a revenue sufficient for defraying their own expense. The fee or\r\n      honorary, which the scholar pays to the master, naturally constitutes a\r\n      revenue of this kind.\r\n\r\n      Even where the reward of the master does not arise altogether from this\r\n      natural revenue, it still is not necessary that it should be derived from\r\n      that general revenue of the society, of which the collection and\r\n      application are, in most countries, assigned to the executive power.\r\n      Through the greater part of Europe, accordingly, the endowment of schools\r\n      and colleges makes either no charge upon that general revenue, or but a\r\n      very small one. It everywhere arises chiefly from some local or provincial\r\n      revenue, from the rent of some landed estate, or from the interest of some\r\n      sum of money, allotted and put under the management of trustees for this\r\n      particular purpose, sometimes by the sovereign himself, and sometimes by\r\n      some private donor.\r\n\r\n      Have those public endowments contributed in general, to promote the end of\r\n      their institution? Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and\r\n      to improve the abilities, of the teachers? Have they directed the course\r\n      of education towards objects more useful, both to the individual and to\r\n      the public, than those to which it would naturally have gone of its own\r\n      accord? It should not seem very difficult to give at least a probable\r\n      answer to each of those questions.\r\n\r\n      In every profession, the exertion of the greater part of those who\r\n      exercise it, is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of\r\n      making that exertion. This necessity is greatest with those to whom the\r\n      emoluments of their profession are the only source from which they expect\r\n      their fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence. In order to\r\n      acquire this fortune, or even to get this subsistence, they must, in the\r\n      course of a year, execute a certain quantity of work of a known value;\r\n      and, where the competition is free, the rivalship of competitors, who are\r\n      all endeavouring to justle one another out of employment, obliges every\r\n      man to endeavour to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness.\r\n      The greatness of the objects which are to be acquired by success in some\r\n      particular professions may, no doubt, sometimes animate the exertions of a\r\n      few men of extraordinary spirit and ambition. Great objects, however, are\r\n      evidently not necessary, in order to occasion the greatest exertions.\r\n      Rivalship and emulation render excellency, even in mean professions, an\r\n      object of ambition, and frequently occasion the very greatest exertions.\r\n      Great objects, on the contrary, alone and unsupported by the necessity of\r\n      application, have seldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable\r\n      exertion. In England, success in the profession of the law leads to some\r\n      very great objects of ambition; and yet how few men, born to easy\r\n      fortunes, have ever in this country been eminent in that profession?\r\n\r\n      The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished, more\r\n      or less, the necessity of application in the teachers. Their subsistence,\r\n      so far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund,\r\n      altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular\r\n      professions.\r\n\r\n      In some universities, the salary makes but a part, and frequently but a\r\n      small part, of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part\r\n      arises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The necessity of\r\n      application, though always more or less diminished, is not, in this case,\r\n      entirely taken away. Reputation in his profession is still of some\r\n      importance to him, and he still has some dependency upon the affection,\r\n      gratitude, and favourable report of those who have attended upon his\r\n      instructions; and these favourable sentiments he is likely to gain in no\r\n      way so well as by deserving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence\r\n      with which he discharges every part of his duty.\r\n\r\n      In other universities, the teacher is prohibited from receiving any\r\n      honorary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of\r\n      the revenue which he derives from his office. His interest is, in this\r\n      case, set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set\r\n      it. It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can;\r\n      and if his emoluments are to be precisely the same, whether he does or\r\n      does not perform some very laborious duty, it is certainly his interest,\r\n      at least as interest is vulgarly understood, either to neglect it\r\n      altogether, or, if he is subject to some authority which will not suffer\r\n      him to do this, to perform it in as careless and slovenly a manner as that\r\n      authority will permit. If he is naturally active and a lover of labour, it\r\n      is his interest to employ that activity in any way from which he can\r\n      derive some advantage, rather than in the performance of his duty, from\r\n      which he can derive none.\r\n\r\n      If the authority to which he is subject resides in the body corporate, the\r\n      college, or university, of which he himself is a member, and in which the\r\n      greater part of the other members are, like himself, persons who either\r\n      are, or ought to be teachers, they are likely to make a common cause, to\r\n      be all very indulgent to one another, and every man to consent that his\r\n      neighbour may neglect his duty, provided he himself is allowed to neglect\r\n      his own. In the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public\r\n      professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the\r\n      pretence of teaching.\r\n\r\n      If the authority to which he is subject resides, not so much in the body\r\n      corporate, of which he is a member, as in some other extraneous persons,\r\n      in the bishop of the diocese, for example, in the governor of the\r\n      province, or, perhaps, in some minister of state, it is not, indeed, in\r\n      this case, very likely that he will be suffered to neglect his duty\r\n      altogether. All that such superiors, however, can force him to do, is to\r\n      attend upon his pupils a certain number of hours, that is, to give a\r\n      certain number of lectures in the week, or in the year. What those\r\n      lectures shall be, must still depend upon the diligence of the teacher;\r\n      and that diligence is likely to be proportioned to the motives which he\r\n      has for exerting it. An extraneous jurisdiction of this kind, besides, is\r\n      liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously. In its nature, it\r\n      is arbitrary and discretionary; and the persons who exercise it, neither\r\n      attending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves, nor perhaps\r\n      understanding the sciences which it is his business to teach, are seldom\r\n      capable of exercising it with judgment. From the insolence of office, too,\r\n      they are frequently indifferent how they exercise it, and are very apt to\r\n      censure or deprive him of his office wantonly and without any just cause.\r\n      The person subject to such jurisdiction is necessarily degraded by it,\r\n      and, instead of being one of the most respectable, is rendered one of the\r\n      meanest and most contemptible persons in the society. It is by powerful\r\n      protection only, that he can effectually guard himself against the bad\r\n      usage to which he is at all times exposed; and this protection he is most\r\n      likely to gain, not by ability or diligence in his profession, but by\r\n      obsequiousness to the will of his superiors, and by being ready, at all\r\n      times, to sacrifice to that will the rights, the interest, and the honour\r\n      of the body corporate, of which he is a member. Whoever has attended for\r\n      any considerable time to the administration of a French university, must\r\n      have had occasion to remark the effects which naturally result from an\r\n      arbitrary and extraneous jurisdiction of this kind.\r\n\r\n      Whatever forces a certain number of students to any college or university,\r\n      independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers, tends more or less\r\n      to diminish the necessity of that merit or reputation.\r\n\r\n      The privileges of graduates in arts, in law, physic, and divinity, when\r\n      they can be obtained only by residing a certain number of years in certain\r\n      universities, necessarily force a certain number of students to such\r\n      universities, independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers. The\r\n      privileges of graduates are a sort of statutes of apprenticeship, which\r\n      have contributed to the improvement of education just as the other\r\n      statutes of apprenticeship have to that of arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\n      The charitable foundations of scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries, etc.\r\n      necessarily attach a certain number of students to certain colleges,\r\n      independent altogether of the merit of those particular colleges. Were the\r\n      students upon such charitable foundations left free to choose what college\r\n      they liked best, such liberty might perhaps contribute to excite some\r\n      emulation among different colleges. A regulation, on the contrary, which\r\n      prohibited even the independent members of every particular college from\r\n      leaving it, and going to any other, without leave first asked and obtained\r\n      of that which they meant to abandon, would tend very much to extinguish\r\n      that emulation.\r\n\r\n      If in each college, the tutor or teacher, who was to instruct each student\r\n      in all arts and sciences, should not be voluntarily chosen by the student,\r\n      but appointed by the head of the college; and if, in case of neglect,\r\n      inability, or bad usage, the student should not be allowed to change him\r\n      for another, without leave first asked and obtained; such a regulation\r\n      would not only tend very much to extinguish all emulation among the\r\n      different tutors of the same college, but to diminish very much, in all of\r\n      them, the necessity of diligence and of attention to their respective\r\n      pupils. Such teachers, though very well paid by their students, might be\r\n      as much disposed to neglect them, as those who are not paid by them at all\r\n      or who have no other recompense but their salary.\r\n\r\n      If the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant\r\n      thing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing to his students, that\r\n      he is either speaking or reading nonsense, or what is very little better\r\n      than nonsense. It must, too, be unpleasant to him to observe, that the\r\n      greater part of his students desert his lectures; or perhaps, attend upon\r\n      them with plain enough marks of neglect, contempt, and derision. If he is\r\n      obliged, therefore, to give a certain number of lectures, these motives\r\n      alone, without any other interest, might dispose him to take some pains to\r\n      give tolerably good ones. Several different expedients, however, may be\r\n      fallen upon, which will effectually blunt the edge of all those\r\n      incitements to diligence. The teacher, instead of explaining to his pupils\r\n      himself the science in which he proposes to instruct them, may read some\r\n      book upon it; and if this book is written in a foreign and dead language,\r\n      by interpreting it to them into their own, or, what would give him still\r\n      less trouble, by making them interpret it to him, and by now and then\r\n      making an occasional remark upon it, he may flatter himself that he is\r\n      giving a lecture. The slightest degree of knowledge and application will\r\n      enable him to do this, without exposing himself to contempt or derision,\r\n      by saying any thing that is really foolish, absurd, or ridiculous. The\r\n      discipline of the college, at the same time, may enable him to force all\r\n      his pupils to the most regular attendance upon his sham lecture, and to\r\n      maintain the most decent and respectful behaviour during the whole time of\r\n      the performance.\r\n\r\n      The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not\r\n      for the benefit of the students, but for the interest, or, more properly\r\n      speaking, for the ease of the masters. Its object is, in all cases, to\r\n      maintain the authority of the master, and, whether he neglects or performs\r\n      his duty, to oblige the students in all cases to behave to him as if he\r\n      performed it with the greatest diligence and ability. It seems to presume\r\n      perfect wisdom and virtue in the one order, and the greatest weakness and\r\n      folly in the other. Where the masters, however, really perform their duty,\r\n      there are no examples, I believe, that the greater part of the students\r\n      ever neglect theirs. No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance\r\n      upon lectures which are really worth the attending, as is well known\r\n      wherever any such lectures are given. Force and restraint may, no doubt,\r\n      be in some degree requisite, in order to oblige children, or very young\r\n      boys, to attend to those parts of education, which it is thought necessary\r\n      for them to acquire during that early period of life; but after twelve or\r\n      thirteen years of age, provided the master does his duty, force or\r\n      restraint can scarce ever be necessary to carry on any part of education.\r\n      Such is the generosity of the greater part of young men, that so far from\r\n      being disposed to neglect or despise the instructions of their master,\r\n      provided he shews some serious intention of being of use to them, they are\r\n      generally inclined to pardon a great deal of incorrectness in the\r\n      performance of his duty, and sometimes even to conceal from the public a\r\n      good deal of gross negligence.\r\n\r\n      Those parts of education, it is to be observed, for the teaching of which\r\n      there are no public institutions, are generally the best taught. When a\r\n      young man goes to a fencing or a dancing school, he does not, indeed,\r\n      always learn to fence or to dance very well; but he seldom fails of\r\n      learning to fence or to dance. The good effects of the riding school are\r\n      not commonly so evident. The expense of a riding school is so great, that\r\n      in most places it is a public institution. The three most essential parts\r\n      of literary education, to read, write, and account, it still continues to\r\n      be more common to acquire in private than in public schools; and it very\r\n      seldom happens, that anybody fails of acquiring them to the degree in\r\n      which it is necessary to acquire them.\r\n\r\n      In England, the public schools are much less corrupted than the\r\n      universities. In the schools, the youth are taught, or at least may be\r\n      taught, Greek and Latin; that is, everything which the masters pretend to\r\n      teach, or which it is expected they should teach. In the universities, the\r\n      youth neither are taught, nor always can find any proper means of being\r\n      taught the sciences, which it is the business of those incorporated bodies\r\n      to teach. The reward of the schoolmaster, in most cases, depends\r\n      principally, in some cases almost entirely, upon the fees or honoraries of\r\n      his scholars. Schools have no exclusive privileges. In order to obtain the\r\n      honours of graduation, it is not necessary that a person should bring a\r\n      certificate of his having studied a certain number of years at a public\r\n      school. If, upon examination, he appears to understand what is taught\r\n      there, no questions are asked about the place where he learnt it.\r\n\r\n      The parts of education which are commonly taught in universities, it may\r\n      perhaps be said, are not very well taught. But had it not been for those\r\n      institutions, they would not have been commonly taught at all; and both\r\n      the individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from the\r\n      want of those important parts of education.\r\n\r\n      The present universities of Europe were originally, the greater part of\r\n      them, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of\r\n      churchmen. They were founded by the authority of the pope; and were so\r\n      entirely under his immediate protection, that their members, whether\r\n      masters or students, had all of them what was then called the benefit of\r\n      clergy, that is, were exempted from the civil jurisdiction of the\r\n      countries in which their respective universities were situated, and were\r\n      amenable only to the ecclesiastical tribunals. What was taught in the\r\n      greater part of those universities was suitable to the end of their\r\n      institution, either theology, or something that was merely preparatory to\r\n      theology.\r\n\r\n      When Christianity was first established by law, a corrupted Latin had\r\n      become the common language of all the western parts of Europe. The service\r\n      of the church, accordingly, and the translation of the Bible which were\r\n      read in churches, were both in that corrupted Latin; that is, in the\r\n      common language of the country, After the irruption of the barbarous\r\n      nations who overturned the Roman empire, Latin gradually ceased to be the\r\n      language of any part of Europe. But the reverence of the people naturally\r\n      preserves the established forms and ceremonies of religion long after the\r\n      circumstances which first introduced and rendered them reasonable, are no\r\n      more. Though Latin, therefore, was no longer understood anywhere by the\r\n      great body of the people, the whole service of the church still continued\r\n      to be performed in that language. Two different languages were thus\r\n      established in Europe, in the same manner as in ancient Egypt: a language\r\n      of the priests, and a language of the people; a sacred and a profane, a\r\n      learned and an unlearned language. But it was necessary that the priests\r\n      should understand something of that sacred and learned language in which\r\n      they were to officiate; and the study of the Latin language therefore\r\n      made, from the beginning, an essential part of university education.\r\n\r\n      It was not so with that either of the Greek or of the Hebrew language. The\r\n      infallible decrees of the church had pronounced the Latin translation of\r\n      the Bible, commonly called the Latin Vulgate, to have been equally\r\n      dictated by divine inspiration, and therefore of equal authority with the\r\n      Greek and Hebrew originals. The knowledge of those two languages,\r\n      therefore, not being indispensably requisite to a churchman, the study of\r\n      them did not for a long time make a necessary part of the common course of\r\n      university education. There are some Spanish universities, I am assured,\r\n      in which the study of the Greek language has never yet made any part of\r\n      that course. The first reformers found the Greek text of the New\r\n      Testament, and even the Hebrew text of the Old, more favourable to their\r\n      opinions than the vulgate translation, which, as might naturally be\r\n      supposed, had been gradually accommodated to support the doctrines of the\r\n      Catholic Church. They set themselves, therefore, to expose the many errors\r\n      of that translation, which the Roman catholic clergy were thus put under\r\n      the necessity of defending or explaining. But this could not well be done\r\n      without some knowledge of the original languages, of which the study was\r\n      therefore gradually introduced into the greater part of universities; both\r\n      of those which embraced, and of those which rejected, the doctrines of the\r\n      reformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that\r\n      classical learning, which, though at first principally cultivated by\r\n      catholics and Italians, happened to come into fashion much about the same\r\n      time that the doctrines of the reformation were set on foot. In the\r\n      greater part of universities, therefore, that language was taught previous\r\n      to the study of philosophy, and as soon as the student had made some\r\n      progress in the Latin. The Hebrew language having no connection with\r\n      classical learning, and, except the Holy Scriptures, being the language of\r\n      not a single book in any esteem the study of it did not commonly commence\r\n      till after that of philosophy, and when the student had entered upon the\r\n      study of theology.\r\n\r\n      Originally, the first rudiments, both of the Greek and Latin languages,\r\n      were taught in universities; and in some universities they still continue\r\n      to be so. In others, it is expected that the student should have\r\n      previously acquired, at least, the rudiments of one or both of those\r\n      languages, of which the study continues to make everywhere a very\r\n      considerable part of university education.\r\n\r\n      The ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches;\r\n      physics, or natural philosophy; ethics, or moral philosophy; and logic.\r\n      This general division seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.\r\n\r\n      The great phenomena of nature, the revolutions of the heavenly bodies,\r\n      eclipses, comets; thunder and lightning, and other extraordinary meteors;\r\n      the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals;\r\n      are objects which, as they necessarily excite the wonder, so they\r\n      naturally call forth the curiosity of mankind to inquire into their\r\n      causes. Superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by\r\n      referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the\r\n      gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more\r\n      familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with, than\r\n      the agency of the gods. As those great phenomena are the first objects of\r\n      human curiosity, so the science which pretends to explain them must\r\n      naturally have been the first branch of philosophy that was cultivated.\r\n      The first philosophers, accordingly, of whom history has preserved any\r\n      account, appear to have been natural philosophers.\r\n\r\n      In every age and country of the world, men must have attended to the\r\n      characters, designs, and actions of one another; and many reputable rules\r\n      and maxims for the conduct of human life must have been laid down and\r\n      approved of by common consent. As soon as writing came into fashion, wise\r\n      men, or those who fancied themselves such, would naturally endeavour to\r\n      increase the number of those established and respected maxims, and to\r\n      express their own sense of what was either proper or improper conduct,\r\n      sometimes in the more artificial form of apologues, like what are called\r\n      the fables of Aesop; and sometimes in the more simple one of apophthegms\r\n      or wise sayings, like the proverbs of Solomon, the verses of Theognis and\r\n      Phocyllides, and some part of the works of Hesiod. They might continue in\r\n      this manner, for a long time, merely to multiply the number of those\r\n      maxims of prudence and morality, without even attempting to arrange them\r\n      in any very distinct or methodical order, much less to connect them\r\n      together by one or more general principles, from which they were all\r\n      deducible, like effects from their natural causes. The beauty of a\r\n      systematical arrangement of different observations, connected by a few\r\n      common principles, was first seen in the rude essays of those ancient\r\n      times towards a system of natural philosophy. Something of the same kind\r\n      was afterwards attempted in morals. The maxims of common life were\r\n      arranged in some methodical order, and connected together by a few common\r\n      principles, in the same manner as they had attempted to arrange and\r\n      connect the phenomena of nature. The science which pretends to investigate\r\n      and explain those connecting principles, is what is properly called Moral\r\n      Philosophy.\r\n\r\n      Different authors gave different systems, both of natural and moral\r\n      philosophy. But the arguments by which they supported those different\r\n      systems, far from being always demonstrations, were frequently at best but\r\n      very slender probabilities, and sometimes mere sophisms, which had no\r\n      other foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language.\r\n      Speculative systems, have, in all ages of the world, been adopted for\r\n      reasons too frivolous to have determined the judgment of any man of common\r\n      sense, in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest. Gross sophistry has\r\n      scarce ever had any influence upon the opinions of mankind, except in\r\n      matters of philosophy and speculation; and in these it has frequently had\r\n      the greatest. The patrons of each system of natural and moral philosophy,\r\n      naturally endeavoured to expose the weakness of the arguments adduced to\r\n      support the systems which were opposite to their own. In examining those\r\n      arguments, they were necessarily led to consider the difference between a\r\n      probable and a demonstrative argument, between a fallacious and a\r\n      conclusive one; and logic, or the science of the general principles of\r\n      good and bad reasoning, necessarily arose out of the observations which a\r\n      scrutiny of this kind gave occasion to; though, in its origin, posterior\r\n      both to physics and to ethics, it was commonly taught, not indeed in all,\r\n      but in the greater part of the ancient schools of philosophy, previously\r\n      to either of those sciences. The student, it seems to have been thought,\r\n      ought to understand well the difference between good and bad reasoning,\r\n      before he was led to reason upon subjects of so great importance.\r\n\r\n      This ancient division of philosophy into three parts was, in the greater\r\n      part of the universities of Europe, changed for another into five.\r\n\r\n      In the ancient philosophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature\r\n      either of the human mind or of the Deity, made a part of the system of\r\n      physics. Those beings, in whatever their essence might be supposed to\r\n      consist, were parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too,\r\n      productive of the most important effects. Whatever human reason could\r\n      either conclude or conjecture concerning them, made, as it were, two\r\n      chapters, though no doubt two very important ones, of the science which\r\n      pretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great\r\n      system of the universe. But in the universities of Europe, where\r\n      philosophy was taught only as subservient to theology, it was natural to\r\n      dwell longer upon these two chapters than upon any other of the science.\r\n      They were gradually more and more extended, and were divided into many\r\n      inferior chapters; till at last the doctrine of spirits, of which so\r\n      little can be known, came to take up as much room in the system of\r\n      philosophy as the doctrine of bodies, of which so much can be known. The\r\n      doctrines concerning those two subjects were considered as making two\r\n      distinct sciences. What are called metaphysics, or pneumatics, were set in\r\n      opposition to physics, and were cultivated not only as the more sublime,\r\n      but, for the purposes of a particular profession, as the more useful\r\n      science of the two. The proper subject of experiment and observation, a\r\n      subject in which a careful attention is capable of making so many useful\r\n      discoveries, was almost entirely neglected. The subject in which, after a\r\n      very few simple and almost obvious truths, the most careful attention can\r\n      discover nothing but obscurity and uncertainty, and can consequently\r\n      produce nothing but subtleties and sophisms, was greatly cultivated.\r\n\r\n      When those two sciences had thus been set in opposition to one another,\r\n      the comparison between them naturally gave birth to a third, to what was\r\n      called ontology, or the science which treated of the qualities and\r\n      attributes which were common to both the subjects of the other two\r\n      sciences. But if subtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of the\r\n      metaphysics or pneumatics of the schools, they composed the whole of this\r\n      cobweb science of ontology, which was likewise sometimes called\r\n      metaphysics.\r\n\r\n      Wherein consisted the happiness and perfection of a man, considered not\r\n      only as an individual, but as the member of a family, of a state, and of\r\n      the great society of mankind, was the object which the ancient moral\r\n      philosophy proposed to investigate. In that philosophy, the duties of\r\n      human life were treated of as subservient to the happiness and perfection\r\n      of human life, But when moral, as well as natural philosophy, came to be\r\n      taught only as subservient to theology, the duties of human life were\r\n      treated of as chiefly subservient to the happiness of a life to come. In\r\n      the ancient philosophy, the perfection of virtue was represented as\r\n      necessarily productive, to the person who possessed it, of the most\r\n      perfect happiness in this life. In the modern philosophy, it was\r\n      frequently represented as generally, or rather as almost always,\r\n      inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life; and heaven was to\r\n      be earned only by penance and mortification, by the austerities and\r\n      abasement of a monk, not by the liberal, generous, and spirited conduct of\r\n      a man. Casuistry, and an ascetic morality, made up, in most cases, the\r\n      greater part of the moral philosophy of the schools. By far the most\r\n      important of all the different branches of philosophy became in this\r\n      manner by far the most corrupted.\r\n\r\n      Such, therefore, was the common course of philosophical education in the\r\n      greater part of the universities in Europe. Logic was taught first;\r\n      ontology came in the second place; pneumatology, comprehending the\r\n      doctrine concerning the nature of the human soul and of the Deity, in the\r\n      third; in the fourth followed a debased system of moral philosophy, which\r\n      was considered as immediately connected with the doctrines of\r\n      pneumatology, with the immortality of the human soul, and with the rewards\r\n      and punishments which, from the justice of the Deity, were to be expected\r\n      in a life to come: a short and superficial system of physics usually\r\n      concluded the course.\r\n\r\n      The alterations which the universities of Europe thus introduced into the\r\n      ancient course of philosophy were all meant for the education of\r\n      ecclesiastics, and to render it a more proper introduction to the study of\r\n      theology. But the additional quantity of subtlety and sophistry, the\r\n      casuistry and ascetic morality which those alterations introduced into it,\r\n      certainly did not render it more for the education of gentlemen or men of\r\n      the world, or more likely either to improve the understanding or to mend\r\n      the heart.\r\n\r\n      This course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the\r\n      greater part of the universities of Europe, with more or less diligence,\r\n      according as the constitution of each particular university happens to\r\n      render diligence more or less necessary to the teachers. In some of the\r\n      richest and best endowed universities, the tutors content themselves with\r\n      teaching a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this corrupted course;\r\n      and even these they commonly teach very negligently and superficially.\r\n\r\n      The improvements which, in modern times have been made in several\r\n      different branches of philosophy, have not, the greater part of them, been\r\n      made in universities, though some, no doubt, have. The greater part of\r\n      universities have not even been very forward to adopt those improvements\r\n      after they were made; and several of those learned societies have chosen\r\n      to remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in which exploded systems and\r\n      obsolete prejudices found shelter and protection, after they had been\r\n      hunted out of every other corner of the world. In general, the richest and\r\n      best endowed universities have been slowest in adopting those\r\n      improvements, and the most averse to permit any considerable change in the\r\n      established plan of education. Those improvements were more easily\r\n      introduced into some of the poorer universities, in which the teachers,\r\n      depending upon their reputation for the greater part of their subsistence,\r\n      were obliged to pay more attention to the current opinions of the world.\r\n\r\n      But though the public schools and universities of Europe were originally\r\n      intended only for the education of a particular profession, that of\r\n      churchmen; and though they were not always very diligent in instructing\r\n      their pupils, even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that\r\n      profession; yet they gradually drew to themselves the education of almost\r\n      all other people, particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of fortune.\r\n      No better method, it seems, could be fallen upon, of spending, with any\r\n      advantage, the long interval between infancy and that period of life at\r\n      which men begin to apply in good earnest to the real business of the\r\n      world, the business which is to employ them during the remainder of their\r\n      days. The greater part of what is taught in schools and universities,\r\n      however, does not seem to be the most proper preparation for that\r\n      business.\r\n\r\n      In England, it becomes every day more and more the custom to send young\r\n      people to travel in foreign countries immediately upon their leaving\r\n      school, and without sending them to any university. Our young people, it\r\n      is said, generally return home much improved by their travels. A young\r\n      man, who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at\r\n      one-and-twenty, returns three or four years older than he was when he went\r\n      abroad; and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in\r\n      three or four years. In the course of his travels, he generally acquires\r\n      some knowledge of one or two foreign languages; a knowledge, however,\r\n      which is seldom sufficient to enable him either to speak or write them\r\n      with propriety. In other respects, he commonly returns home more\r\n      conceited, more unprincipled, more dissipated, and more incapable of any\r\n      serious application, either to study or to business, than he could well\r\n      have become in so short a time had he lived at home. By travelling so very\r\n      young, by spending in the most frivolous dissipation the most precious\r\n      years of his life, at a distance from the inspection and control of his\r\n      parents and relations, every useful habit, which the earlier parts of his\r\n      education might have had some tendency to form in him, instead of being\r\n      riveted and confirmed, is almost necessarily either weakened or effaced.\r\n      Nothing but the discredit into which the universities are allowing\r\n      themselves to fall, could ever have brought into repute so very absurd a\r\n      practice as that of travelling at this early period of life. By sending\r\n      his son abroad, a father delivers himself, at least for some time, from so\r\n      disagreeable an object as that of a son unemployed, neglected, and going\r\n      to ruin before his eyes.\r\n\r\n      Such have been the effects of some of the modern institutions for\r\n      education.\r\n\r\n      Different plans and different institutions for education seem to have\r\n      taken place in other ages and nations.\r\n\r\n      In the republics of ancient Greece, every free citizen was instructed,\r\n      under the direction of the public magistrate, in gymnastic exercises and\r\n      in music. By gymnastic exercises, it was intended to harden his body, to\r\n      sharpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of\r\n      war; and as the Greek militia was, by all accounts, one of the best that\r\n      ever was in the world, this part of their public education must have\r\n      answered completely the purpose for which it was intended. By the other\r\n      part, music, it was proposed, at least by the philosophers and historians,\r\n      who have given us an account of those institutions, to humanize the mind,\r\n      to soften the temper, and to dispose it for performing all the social and\r\n      moral duties of public and private life.\r\n\r\n      In ancient Rome, the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the same\r\n      purpose as those of the Gymnasium in ancient Greece, and they seem to have\r\n      answered it equally well. But among the Romans there was nothing which\r\n      corresponded to the musical education of the Greeks. The morals of the\r\n      Romans, however, both in private and public life, seem to have been, not\r\n      only equal, but, upon the whole, a good deal superior to those of the\r\n      Greeks. That they were superior in private life, we have the express\r\n      testimony of Polybius, and of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, two authors well\r\n      acquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor of the Greek and Roman\r\n      history bears witness to the superiority of the public morals of the\r\n      Romans. The good temper and moderation of contending factions seem to be\r\n      the most essential circumstances in the public morals of a free people.\r\n      But the factions of the Greeks were almost always violent and sanguinary;\r\n      whereas, till the time of the Gracchi, no blood had ever been shed in any\r\n      Roman faction; and from the time of the Gracchi, the Roman republic may be\r\n      considered as in reality dissolved. Notwithstanding, therefore, the very\r\n      respectable authority of Plato, Aristotle, and Polybius, and\r\n      notwithstanding the very ingenious reasons by which Mr Montesquieu\r\n      endeavours to support that authority, it seems probable that the musical\r\n      education of the Greeks had no great effect in mending their morals,\r\n      since, without any such education, those of the Romans were, upon the\r\n      whole, superior. The respect of those ancient sages for the institutions\r\n      of their ancestors had probably disposed them to find much political\r\n      wisdom in what was, perhaps, merely an ancient custom, continued, without\r\n      interruption, from the earliest period of those societies, to the times in\r\n      which they had arrived at a considerable degree of refinement. Music and\r\n      dancing are the great amusements of almost all barbarous nations, and the\r\n      great accomplishments which are supposed to fit any man for entertaining\r\n      his society. It is so at this day among the negroes on the coast of\r\n      Africa. It was so among the ancient Celtes, among the ancient\r\n      Scandinavians, and, as we may learn from Homer, among the ancient Greeks,\r\n      in the times preceding the Trojan war. When the Greek tribes had formed\r\n      themselves into little republics, it was natural that the study of those\r\n      accomplishments should for a long time make a part of the public and\r\n      common education of the people.\r\n\r\n      The masters who instructed the young people, either in music or in\r\n      military exercises, do not seem to have been paid, or even appointed by\r\n      the state, either in Rome or even at Athens, the Greek republic of whose\r\n      laws and customs we are the best informed. The state required that every\r\n      free citizen should fit himself for defending it in war, and should upon\r\n      that account, learn his military exercises. But it left him to learn them\r\n      of such masters as he could find; and it seems to have advanced nothing\r\n      for this purpose, but a public field or place of exercise, in which he\r\n      should practise and perform them.\r\n\r\n      In the early ages, both of the Greek and Roman republics, the other parts\r\n      of education seem to have consisted in learning to read, write, and\r\n      account, according to the arithmetic of the times. These accomplishments\r\n      the richer citizens seem frequently to have acquired at home, by the\r\n      assistance of some domestic pedagogue, who was, generally, either a slave\r\n      or a freedman; and the poorer citizens in the schools of such masters as\r\n      made a trade of teaching for hire. Such parts of education, however, were\r\n      abandoned altogether to the care of the parents or guardians of each\r\n      individual. It does not appear that the state ever assumed any inspection\r\n      or direction of them. By a law of Solon, indeed, the children were\r\n      acquitted from maintaining those parents who had neglected to instruct\r\n      them in some profitable trade or business.\r\n\r\n      In the progress of refinement, when philosophy and rhetoric came into\r\n      fashion, the better sort of people used to send their children to the\r\n      schools of philosophers and rhetoricians, in order to be instructed in\r\n      these fashionable sciences. But those schools were not supported by the\r\n      public. They were, for a long time, barely tolerated by it. The demand for\r\n      philosophy and rhetoric was, for a long time, so small, that the first\r\n      professed teachers of either could not find constant employment in any one\r\n      city, but were obliged to travel about from place to place. In this manner\r\n      lived Zeno of Elea, Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, and many others. As the\r\n      demand increased, the school, both of philosophy and rhetoric, became\r\n      stationary, first in Athens, and afterwards in several other cities. The\r\n      state, however, seems never to have encouraged them further, than by\r\n      assigning to some of them a particular place to teach in, which was\r\n      sometimes done, too, by private donors. The state seems to have assigned\r\n      the Academy to Plato, the Lyceum to Aristotle, and the Portico to Zeno of\r\n      Citta, the founder of the Stoics. But Epicurus bequeathed his gardens to\r\n      his own school. Till about the time of Marcus Antoninus, however, no\r\n      teacher appears to have had any salary from the public, or to have had any\r\n      other emoluments, but what arose from the honoraries or fees of his\r\n      scholars. The bounty which that philosophical emperor, as we learn from\r\n      Lucian, bestowed upon one of the teachers of philosophy, probably lasted\r\n      no longer than his own life. There was nothing equivalent to the\r\n      privileges of graduation; and to have attended any of those schools was\r\n      not necessary, in order to be permitted to practise any particular trade\r\n      or profession. If the opinion of their own utility could not draw scholars\r\n      to them, the law neither forced anybody to go to them, nor rewarded\r\n      anybody for having gone to them. The teachers had no jurisdiction over\r\n      their pupils, nor any other authority besides that natural authority which\r\n      superior virtue and abilities never fail to procure from young people\r\n      towards those who are entrusted with any part of their education.\r\n\r\n      At Rome, the study of the civil law made a part of the education, not of\r\n      the greater part of the citizens, but of some particular families. The\r\n      young people, however, who wished to acquire knowledge in the law, had no\r\n      public school to go to, and had no other method of studying it, than by\r\n      frequenting the company of such of their relations and friends as were\r\n      supposed to understand it. It is, perhaps, worth while to remark, that\r\n      though the laws of the twelve tables were many of them copied from those\r\n      of some ancient Greek republics, yet law never seems to have grown up to\r\n      be a science in any republic of ancient Greece. In Rome it became a\r\n      science very early, and gave a considerable degree of illustration to\r\n      those citizens who had the reputation of understanding it. In the\r\n      republics of ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, the ordinary courts\r\n      of justice consisted of numerous, and therefore disorderly, bodies of\r\n      people, who frequently decided almost at random, or as clamour, faction,\r\n      and party-spirit, happened to determine. The ignominy of an unjust\r\n      decision, when it was to be divided among five hundred, a thousand, or\r\n      fifteen hundred people (for some of their courts were so very numerous),\r\n      could not fall very heavy upon any individual. At Rome, on the contrary,\r\n      the principal courts of justice consisted either of a single judge, or of\r\n      a small number of judges, whose characters, especially as they deliberated\r\n      always in public, could not fail to be very much affected by any rash or\r\n      unjust decision. In doubtful cases such courts, from their anxiety to\r\n      avoid blame, would naturally endeavour to shelter themselves under the\r\n      example or precedent of the judges who had sat before them, either in the\r\n      same or in some other court. This attention to practice and precedent,\r\n      necessarily formed the Roman law into that regular and orderly system in\r\n      which it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention has had the\r\n      like effects upon the laws of every other country where such attention has\r\n      taken place. The superiority of character in the Romans over that of the\r\n      Greeks, so much remarked by Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, was\r\n      probably more owing to the better constitution of their courts of justice,\r\n      than to any of the circumstances to which those authors ascribe it. The\r\n      Romans are said to have been particularly distinguished for their superior\r\n      respect to an oath. But the people who were accustomed to make oath only\r\n      before some diligent and well informed court of justice, would naturally\r\n      be much more attentive to what they swore, than they who were accustomed\r\n      to do the same thing before mobbish and disorderly assemblies.\r\n\r\n      The abilities, both civil and military, of the Greeks and Romans, will\r\n      readily be allowed to have been at least equal to those of any modern\r\n      nation. Our prejudice is perhaps rather to overrate them. But except in\r\n      what related to military exercises, the state seems to have been at no\r\n      pains to form those great abilities; for I cannot be induced to believe\r\n      that the musical education of the Greeks could be of much consequence in\r\n      forming them. Masters, however, had been found, it seems, for instructing\r\n      the better sort of people among those nations, in every art and science in\r\n      which the circumstances of their society rendered it necessary or\r\n      convenient for them to be instructed. The demand for such instruction\r\n      produced, what it always produces, the talent for giving it; and the\r\n      emulation which an unrestrained competition never fails to excite, appears\r\n      to have brought that talent to a very high degree of perfection. In the\r\n      attention which the ancient philosophers excited, in the empire which they\r\n      acquired over the opinions and principles of their auditors, in the\r\n      faculty which they possessed of giving a certain tone and character to the\r\n      conduct and conversation of those auditors, they appear to have been much\r\n      superior to any modern teachers. In modern times, the diligence of public\r\n      teachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them\r\n      more or less independent of their success and reputation in their\r\n      particular professions. Their salaries, too, put the private teacher, who\r\n      would pretend to come into competition with them, in the same state with a\r\n      merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty, in competition with those\r\n      who trade with a considerable one. If he sells his goods at nearly the\r\n      same price, he cannot have the same profit; and poverty and beggary at\r\n      least, if not bankruptcy and ruin, will infallibly be his lot. If he\r\n      attempts to sell them much dearer, he is likely to have so few customers,\r\n      that his circumstances will not be much mended. The privileges of\r\n      graduation, besides, are in many countries necessary, or at least\r\n      extremely convenient, to most men of learned professions, that is, to the\r\n      far greater part of those who have occasion for a learned education. But\r\n      those privileges can be obtained only by attending the lectures of the\r\n      public teachers. The most careful attendance upon the ablest instructions\r\n      of any private teacher cannot always give any title to demand them. It is\r\n      from these different causes that the private teacher of any of the\r\n      sciences, which are commonly taught in universities, is, in modern times,\r\n      generally considered as in the very lowest order of men of letters. A man\r\n      of real abilities can scarce find out a more humiliating or a more\r\n      unprofitable employment to turn them to. The endowments of schools and\r\n      colleges have in this manner not only corrupted the diligence of public\r\n      teachers, but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private\r\n      ones.\r\n\r\n      Were there no public institutions for education, no system, no science,\r\n      would be taught, for which there was not some demand, or which the\r\n      circumstances of the times did not render it either necessary or\r\n      convenient, or at least fashionable to learn. A private teacher could\r\n      never find his account in teaching either an exploded and antiquated\r\n      system of a science acknowledged to be useful, or a science universally\r\n      believed to be a mere useless and pedantic heap of sophistry and nonsense.\r\n      Such systems, such sciences, can subsist nowhere but in those incorporated\r\n      societies for education, whose prosperity and revenue are in a great\r\n      measure independent of their industry. Were there no public institutions\r\n      for education, a gentleman, after going through, with application and\r\n      abilities, the most complete course of education which the circumstances\r\n      of the times were supposed to afford, could not come into the world\r\n      completely ignorant of everything which is the common subject of\r\n      conversation among gentlemen and men of the world.\r\n\r\n      There are no public institutions for the education of women, and there is\r\n      accordingly nothing useless, absurd, or fantastical, in the common course\r\n      of their education. They are taught what their parents or guardians judge\r\n      it necessary or useful for them to learn, and they are taught nothing\r\n      else. Every part of their education tends evidently to some useful\r\n      purpose; either to improve the natural attractions of their person, or to\r\n      form their mind to reserve, to modesty, to chastity, and to economy; to\r\n      render them both likely to became the mistresses of a family, and to\r\n      behave properly when they have become such. In every part of her life, a\r\n      woman feels some conveniency or advantage from every part of her\r\n      education. It seldom happens that a man, in any part of his life, derives\r\n      any conveniency or advantage from some of the most laborious and\r\n      troublesome parts of his education.\r\n\r\n      Ought the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked, to the\r\n      education of the people? Or, if it ought to give any, what are the\r\n      different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different\r\n      orders of the people? and in what manner ought it to attend to them?\r\n\r\n      In some cases, the state of society necessarily places the greater part of\r\n      individuals in such situations as naturally form in them, without any\r\n      attention of government, almost all the abilities and virtues which that\r\n      state requires, or perhaps can admit of. In other cases, the state of the\r\n      society does not place the greater part of individuals in such situations;\r\n      and some attention of government is necessary, in order to prevent the\r\n      almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people.\r\n\r\n      In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far\r\n      greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of\r\n      the people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations;\r\n      frequently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of\r\n      men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose\r\n      whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the\r\n      effects, too, are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no\r\n      occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention, in\r\n      finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He\r\n      naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally\r\n      becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to\r\n      become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing\r\n      or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any\r\n      generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just\r\n      judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of\r\n      the great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether\r\n      incapable of judging; and unless very particular pains have been taken to\r\n      render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of defending his country in\r\n      war. The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage\r\n      of his mind, and makes him regard, with abhorrence, the irregular,\r\n      uncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier. It corrupts even the\r\n      activity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting his strength\r\n      with vigour and perseverance in any other employment, than that to which\r\n      he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this\r\n      manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and\r\n      martial virtues. But in every improved and civilized society, this is the\r\n      state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the\r\n      people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to\r\n      prevent it.\r\n\r\n      It is otherwise in the barbarous societies, as they are commonly called,\r\n      of hunters, of shepherds, and even of husbandmen in that rude state of\r\n      husbandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures, and the\r\n      extension of foreign commerce. In such societies, the varied occupations\r\n      of every man oblige every man to exert his capacity, and to invent\r\n      expedients for removing difficulties which are continually occurring.\r\n      Invention is kept alive, and the mind is not suffered to fall into that\r\n      drowsy stupidity, which, in a civilized society, seems to benumb the\r\n      understanding of almost all the inferior ranks of people. In those\r\n      barbarous societies, as they are called, every man, it has already been\r\n      observed, is a warrior. Every man, too, is in some measure a statesman,\r\n      and can form a tolerable judgment concerning the interest of the society,\r\n      and the conduct of those who govern it. How far their chiefs are good\r\n      judges in peace, or good leaders in war, is obvious to the observation of\r\n      almost every single man among them. In such a society, indeed, no man can\r\n      well acquire that improved and refined understanding which a few men\r\n      sometimes possess in a more civilized state. Though in a rude society\r\n      there is a good deal of variety in the occupations of every individual,\r\n      there is not a great deal in those of the whole society. Every man does,\r\n      or is capable of doing, almost every thing which any other man does, or is\r\n      capable of being. Every man has a considerable degree of knowledge,\r\n      ingenuity, and invention but scarce any man has a great degree. The\r\n      degree, however, which is commonly possessed, is generally sufficient for\r\n      conducting the whole simple business of the society. In a civilized state,\r\n      on the contrary, though there is little variety in the occupations of the\r\n      greater part of individuals, there is an almost infinite variety in those\r\n      of the whole society. These varied occupations present an almost infinite\r\n      variety of objects to the contemplation of those few, who, being attached\r\n      to no particular occupation themselves, have leisure and inclination to\r\n      examine the occupations of other people. The contemplation of so great a\r\n      variety of objects necessarily exercises their minds in endless\r\n      comparisons and combinations, and renders their understandings, in an\r\n      extraordinary degree, both acute and comprehensive. Unless those few,\r\n      however, happen to be placed in some very particular situations, their\r\n      great abilities, though honourable to themselves, may contribute very\r\n      little to the good government or happiness of their society.\r\n      Notwithstanding the great abilities of those few, all the nobler parts of\r\n      the human character may be, in a great measure, obliterated and\r\n      extinguished in the great body of the people.\r\n\r\n      The education of the common people requires, perhaps, in a civilized and\r\n      commercial society, the attention of the public, more than that of people\r\n      of some rank and fortune. People of some rank and fortune are generally\r\n      eighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that particular\r\n      business, profession, or trade, by which they propose to distinguish\r\n      themselves in the world. They have, before that, full time to acquire, or\r\n      at least to fit themselves for afterwards acquiring, every accomplishment\r\n      which can recommend them to the public esteem, or render them worthy of\r\n      it. Their parents or guardians are generally sufficiently anxious that\r\n      they should be so accomplished, and are in most cases, willing enough to\r\n      lay out the expense which is necessary for that purpose. If they are not\r\n      always properly educated, it is seldom from the want of expense laid out\r\n      upon their education, but from the improper application of that expense.\r\n      It is seldom from the want of masters, but from the negligence and\r\n      incapacity of the masters who are to be had, and from the difficulty, or\r\n      rather from the impossibility, which there is, in the present state of\r\n      things, of finding any better. The employments, too, in which people of\r\n      some rank or fortune spend the greater part of their lives, are not, like\r\n      those of the common people, simple and uniform. They are almost all of\r\n      them extremely complicated, and such as exercise the head more than the\r\n      hands. The understandings of those who are engaged in such employments,\r\n      can seldom grow torpid for want of exercise. The employments of people of\r\n      some rank and fortune, besides, are seldom such as harass them from\r\n      morning to night. They generally have a good deal of leisure, during which\r\n      they may perfect themselves in every branch, either of useful or\r\n      ornamental knowledge, of which they may have laid the foundation, or for\r\n      which they may have acquired some taste in the earlier part of life.\r\n\r\n      It is otherwise with the common people. They have little time to spare for\r\n      education. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them, even in\r\n      infancy. As soon as they are able to work, they must apply to some trade,\r\n      by which they can earn their subsistence. That trade, too, is generally so\r\n      simple and uniform, as to give little exercise to the understanding;\r\n      while, at the same time, their labour is both so constant and so severe,\r\n      that it leaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply to, or\r\n      even to think of any thing else.\r\n\r\n      But though the common people cannot, in any civilized society, be so well\r\n      instructed as people of some rank and fortune; the most essential parts of\r\n      education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired at so\r\n      early a period of life, that the greater part, even of those who are to be\r\n      bred to the lowest occupations, have time to acquire them before they can\r\n      be employed in those occupations. For a very small expense, the public can\r\n      facilitate, can encourage and can even impose upon almost the whole body\r\n      of the people, the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of\r\n      education.\r\n\r\n      The public can facilitate this acquisition, by establishing in every\r\n      parish or district a little school, where children maybe taught for a\r\n      reward so moderate, that even a common labourer may afford it; the master\r\n      being partly, but not wholly, paid by the public; because, if he was\r\n      wholly, or even principally, paid by it, he would soon learn to neglect\r\n      his business. In Scotland, the establishment of such parish schools has\r\n      taught almost the whole common people to read, and a very great proportion\r\n      of them to write and account. In England, the establishment of charity\r\n      schools has had an effect of the same kind, though not so universally,\r\n      because the establishment is not so universal. If, in those little\r\n      schools, the books by which the children are taught to read, were a little\r\n      more instructive than they commonly are; and if, instead of a little\r\n      smattering in Latin, which the children of the common people are sometimes\r\n      taught there, and which can scarce ever be of any use to them, they were\r\n      instructed in the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics; the literary\r\n      education of this rank of people would, perhaps, be as complete as can be.\r\n      There is scarce a common trade, which does not afford some opportunities\r\n      of applying to it the principles of geometry and mechanics, and which\r\n      would not, therefore, gradually exercise and improve the common people in\r\n      those principles, the necessary introduction to the most sublime, as well\r\n      as to the most useful sciences.\r\n\r\n      The public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential parts of\r\n      education, by giving small premiums, and little badges of distinction, to\r\n      the children of the common people who excel in them.\r\n\r\n      The public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the\r\n      necessity of acquiring the most essential parts of education, by obliging\r\n      every man to undergo an examination or probation in them, before he can\r\n      obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to set up any trade,\r\n      either in a village or town corporate.\r\n\r\n      It was in this manner, by facilitating the acquisition of their military\r\n      and gymnastic exercises, by encouraging it, and even by imposing upon the\r\n      whole body of the people the necessity of learning those exercises, that\r\n      the Greek and Roman republics maintained the martial spirit of their\r\n      respective citizens. They facilitated the acquisition of those exercises,\r\n      by appointing a certain place for learning and practising them, and by\r\n      granting to certain masters the privilege of teaching in that place. Those\r\n      masters do not appear to have had either salaries or exclusive privileges\r\n      of any kind. Their reward consisted altogether in what they got from their\r\n      scholars; and a citizen, who had learnt his exercises in the public\r\n      gymnasia, had no sort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them\r\n      privately, provided the latter had learned them equally well. Those\r\n      republics encouraged the acquisition of those exercises, by bestowing\r\n      little premiums and badges of distinction upon those who excelled in them.\r\n      To have gained a prize in the Olympic, Isthmian, or Nemaean games, gave\r\n      illustration, not only to the person who gained it, but to his whole\r\n      family and kindred. The obligation which every citizen was under, to serve\r\n      a certain number of years, if called upon, in the armies of the republic,\r\n      sufficiently imposed the necessity of learning those exercises, without\r\n      which he could not be fit for that service.\r\n\r\n      That in the progress of improvement, the practice of military exercises,\r\n      unless government takes proper pains to support it, goes gradually to\r\n      decay, and, together with it, the martial spirit of the great body of the\r\n      people, the example of modern Europe sufficiently demonstrates. But the\r\n      security of every society must always depend, more or less, upon the\r\n      martial spirit of the great body of the people. In the present times,\r\n      indeed, that martial spirit alone, and unsupported by a well-disciplined\r\n      standing army, would not, perhaps, be sufficient for the defence and\r\n      security of any society. But where every citizen had the spirit of a\r\n      soldier, a smaller standing army would surely be requisite. That spirit,\r\n      besides, would necessarily diminish very much the dangers to liberty,\r\n      whether real or imaginary, which are commonly apprehended from a standing\r\n      army. As it would very much facilitate the operations of that army against\r\n      a foreign invader; so it would obstruct them as much, if unfortunately\r\n      they should ever be directed against the constitution of the state.\r\n\r\n      The ancient institutions of Greece and Rome seem to have been much more\r\n      effectual for maintaining the martial spirit of the great body of the\r\n      people, than the establishment of what are called the militias of modern\r\n      times. They were much more simple. When they were once established, they\r\n      executed themselves, and it required little or no attention from\r\n      government to maintain them in the most perfect vigour. Whereas to\r\n      maintain, even in tolerable execution, the complex regulations of any\r\n      modern militia, requires the continual and painful attention of\r\n      government, without which they are constantly falling into total neglect\r\n      and disuse. The influence, besides, of the ancient institutions, was much\r\n      more universal. By means of them, the whole body of the people was\r\n      completely instructed in the use of arms; whereas it is but a very small\r\n      part of them who can ever be so instructed by the regulations of any\r\n      modern militia, except, perhaps, that of Switzerland. But a coward, a man\r\n      incapable either of defending or of revenging himself, evidently wants one\r\n      of the most essential parts of the character of a man. He is as much\r\n      mutilated and deformed in his mind as another is in his body, who is\r\n      either deprived of some of its most essential members, or has lost the use\r\n      of them. He is evidently the more wretched and miserable of the two;\r\n      because happiness and misery, which reside altogether in the mind, must\r\n      necessarily depend more upon the healthful or unhealthful, the mutilated\r\n      or entire state of the mind, than upon that of the body. Even though the\r\n      martial spirit of the people were of no use towards the defence of the\r\n      society, yet, to prevent that sort of mental mutilation, deformity, and\r\n      wretchedness, which cowardice necessarily involves in it, from spreading\r\n      themselves through the great body of the people, would still deserve the\r\n      most serious attention of government; in the same manner as it would\r\n      deserve its most serious attention to prevent a leprosy, or any other\r\n      loathsome and offensive disease, though neither mortal nor dangerous, from\r\n      spreading itself among them; though, perhaps, no other public good might\r\n      result from such attention, besides the prevention of so great a public\r\n      evil.\r\n\r\n      The same thing may be said of the gross ignorance and stupidity which, in\r\n      a civilized society, seem so frequently to benumb the understandings of\r\n      all the inferior ranks of people. A man without the proper use of the\r\n      intellectual faculties of a man, is, if possible, more contemptible than\r\n      even a coward, and seems to be mutilated and deformed in a still more\r\n      essential part of the character of human nature. Though the state was to\r\n      derive no advantage from the instruction of the inferior ranks of people,\r\n      it would still deserve its attention that they should not be altogether\r\n      uninstructed. The state, however, derives no inconsiderable advantage from\r\n      their instruction. The more they are instructed, the less liable they are\r\n      to the delusions of enthusiasm and superstition, which, among ignorant\r\n      nations frequently occasion the most dreadful disorders. An instructed and\r\n      intelligent people, besides, are always more decent and orderly than an\r\n      ignorant and stupid one. They feel themselves, each individually, more\r\n      respectable, and more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful\r\n      superiors, and they are, therefore, more disposed to respect those\r\n      superiors. They are more disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing\r\n      through, the interested complaints of faction and sedition; and they are,\r\n      upon that account, less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary\r\n      opposition to the measures of government. In free countries, where the\r\n      safety of government depends very much upon the favourable judgment which\r\n      the people may form of its conduct, it must surely be of the highest\r\n      importance, that they should not be disposed to judge rashly or\r\n      capriciously concerning it.\r\n\r\n      Art. III.—Of the Expense of the Institutions for the Instruction of\r\n      People of all Ages.\r\n\r\n      The institutions for the instruction of people of all ages, are chiefly\r\n      those for religious instruction. This is a species of instruction, of\r\n      which the object is not so much to render the people good citizens in this\r\n      world, as to prepare them for another and a better world in the life to\r\n      come. The teachers of the doctrine which contains this instruction, in the\r\n      same manner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for their\r\n      subsistence upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers; or they may\r\n      derive it from some other fund, to which the law of their country may\r\n      entitle them; such as a landed estate, a tythe or land tax, an established\r\n      salary or stipend. Their exertion, their zeal and industry, are likely to\r\n      be much greater in the former situation than in the latter. In this\r\n      respect, the teachers of a new religion have always had a considerable\r\n      advantage in attacking those ancient and established systems, of which the\r\n      clergy, reposing themselves upon their benefices, had neglected to keep up\r\n      the fervour of faith and devotion in the great body of the people; and\r\n      having given themselves up to indolence, were become altogether incapable\r\n      of making any vigorous exertion in defence even of their own\r\n      establishment. The clergy of an established and well endowed religion\r\n      frequently become men of learning and elegance, who possess all the\r\n      virtues of gentlemen, or which can recommend them to the esteem of\r\n      gentlemen; but they are apt gradually to lose the qualities, both good and\r\n      bad, which gave them authority and influence with the inferior ranks of\r\n      people, and which had perhaps been the original causes of the success and\r\n      establishment of their religion. Such a clergy, when attacked by a set of\r\n      popular and bold, though perhaps stupid and ignorant enthusiasts, feel\r\n      themselves as perfectly defenceless as the indolent, effeminate, and full\r\n      fed nations of the southern parts of Asia, when they were invaded by the\r\n      active, hardy, and hungry Tartars of the north. Such a clergy, upon such\r\n      an emergency, have commonly no other resource than to call upon the civil\r\n      magistrate to persecute, destroy, or drive out their adversaries, as\r\n      disturbers of the public peace. It was thus that the Roman catholic clergy\r\n      called upon the civil magistrate to persecute the protestants, and the\r\n      church of England to persecute the dissenters; and that in general every\r\n      religious sect, when it has once enjoyed, for a century or two, the\r\n      security of a legal establishment, has found itself incapable of making\r\n      any vigorous defence against any new sect which chose to attack its\r\n      doctrine or discipline. Upon such occasions, the advantage, in point of\r\n      learning and good writing, may sometimes be on the side of the established\r\n      church. But the arts of popularity, all the arts of gaining proselytes,\r\n      are constantly on the side of its adversaries. In England, those arts have\r\n      been long neglected by the well endowed clergy of the established church,\r\n      and are at present chiefly cultivated by the dissenters and by the\r\n      methodists. The independent provisions, however, which in many places have\r\n      been made for dissenting teachers, by means of voluntary subscriptions, of\r\n      trust rights, and other evasions of the law, seem very much to have abated\r\n      the zeal and activity of those teachers. They have many of them become\r\n      very learned, ingenious, and respectable men; but they have in general\r\n      ceased to be very popular preachers. The methodists, without half the\r\n      learning of the dissenters, are much more in vogue.\r\n\r\n      In the church of Rome the industry and zeal of the inferior clergy are\r\n      kept more alive by the powerful motive of self-interest, than perhaps in\r\n      any established protestant church. The parochial clergy derive many of\r\n      them, a very considerable part of their subsistence from the voluntary\r\n      oblations of the people; a source of revenue, which confession gives them\r\n      many opportunities of improving. The mendicant orders derive their whole\r\n      subsistence from such oblations. It is with them as with the hussars and\r\n      light infantry of some armies; no plunder, no pay. The parochial clergy\r\n      are like those teachers whose reward depends partly upon their salary, and\r\n      partly upon the fees or honoraries which they get from their pupils; and\r\n      these must always depend, more or less, upon their industry and\r\n      reputation. The mendicant orders are like those teachers whose subsistence\r\n      depends altogether upon their industry. They are obliged, therefore, to\r\n      use every art which can animate the devotion of the common people. The\r\n      establishment of the two great mendicant orders of St Dominic and St.\r\n      Francis, it is observed by Machiavel, revived, in the thirteenth and\r\n      fourteenth centuries, the languishing faith and devotion of the catholic\r\n      church. In Roman catholic countries, the spirit of devotion is supported\r\n      altogether by the monks, and by the poorer parochial clergy. The great\r\n      dignitaries of the church, with all the accomplishments of gentlemen and\r\n      men of the world, and sometimes with those of men of learning, are careful\r\n      to maintain the necessary discipline over their inferiors, but seldom give\r\n      themselves any trouble about the instruction of the people.\r\n\r\n      “Most of the arts and professions in a state,” says by far the most\r\n      illustrious philosopher and historian of the present age, “are of such a\r\n      nature, that, while they promote the interests of the society, they are\r\n      also useful or agreeable to some individuals; and, in that case, the\r\n      constant rule of the magistrate, except, perhaps, on the first\r\n      introduction of any art, is, to leave the profession to itself, and trust\r\n      its encouragement to the individuals who reap the benefit of it. The\r\n      artizans, finding their profits to rise by the favour of their customers,\r\n      increase, as much as possible, their skill and industry; and as matters\r\n      are not disturbed by any injudicious tampering, the commodity is always\r\n      sure to be at all times nearly proportioned to the demand.\r\n\r\n      “But there are also some callings which, though useful and even necessary\r\n      in a state, bring no advantage or pleasure to any individual; and the\r\n      supreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers\r\n      of those professions. It must give them public encouragement in order to\r\n      their subsistence; and it must provide against that negligence to which\r\n      they will naturally be subject, either by annexing particular honours to\r\n      profession, by establishing a long subordination of ranks, and a strict\r\n      dependence, or by some other expedient. The persons employed in the\r\n      finances, fleets, and magistracy, are instances of this order of men.\r\n\r\n      “It may naturally be thought, at first sight, that the ecclesiastics\r\n      belong to the first class, and that their encouragement, as well as that\r\n      of lawyers and physicians, may safely be entrusted to the liberality of\r\n      individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or\r\n      consolation from their spiritual ministry and assistance. Their industry\r\n      and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by such an additional motive; and\r\n      their skill in the profession, as well as their address in governing the\r\n      minds of the people, must receive daily increase, from their increasing\r\n      practice, study, and attention.\r\n\r\n      “But if we consider the matter more closely, we shall find that this\r\n      interested diligence of the clergy is what every wise legislator will\r\n      study to prevent; because, in every religion except the true, it is highly\r\n      pernicious, and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the truth, by\r\n      infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly, and delusion.\r\n      Each ghostly practitioner, in order to render himself more precious and\r\n      sacred in the eyes of his retainers, will inspire them with the most\r\n      violent abhorrence of all other sects, and continually endeavour, by some\r\n      novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience. No regard will be\r\n      paid to truth, morals, or decency, in the doctrines inculcated. Every\r\n      tenet will be adopted that best suits the disorderly affections of the\r\n      human frame. Customers will be drawn to each conventicle by new industry\r\n      and address, in practising on the passions and credulity of the populace.\r\n      And, in the end, the civil magistrate will find that he has dearly paid\r\n      for his intended frugality, in saving a fixed establishment for the\r\n      priests; and that, in reality, the most decent and advantageous\r\n      composition, which he can make with the spiritual guides, is to bribe\r\n      their indolence, by assigning stated salaries to their profession, and\r\n      rendering it superfluous for them to be farther active, than merely to\r\n      prevent their flock from straying in quest of new pastors. And in this\r\n      manner ecclesiastical establishments, though commonly they arose at first\r\n      from religious views, prove in the end advantageous to the political\r\n      interests of society.”\r\n\r\n      But whatever may have been the good or bad effects of the independent\r\n      provision of the clergy, it has, perhaps, been very seldom bestowed upon\r\n      them from any view to those effects. Times of violent religious\r\n      controversy have generally been times of equally violent political\r\n      faction. Upon such occasions, each political party has either found it, or\r\n      imagined it, for his interest, to league itself with some one or other of\r\n      the contending religious sects. But this could be done only by adopting,\r\n      or, at least, by favouring the tenets of that particular sect. The sect\r\n      which had the good fortune to be leagued with the conquering party\r\n      necessarily shared in the victory of its ally, by whose favour and\r\n      protection it was soon enabled, in some degree, to silence and subdue all\r\n      its adversaries. Those adversaries had generally leagued themselves with\r\n      the enemies of the conquering party, and were, therefore the enemies of\r\n      that party. The clergy of this particular sect having thus become complete\r\n      masters of the field, and their influence and authority with the great\r\n      body of the people being in its highest vigour, they were powerful enough\r\n      to overawe the chiefs and leaders of their own party, and to oblige the\r\n      civil magistrate to respect their opinions and inclinations. Their first\r\n      demand was generally that he should silence and subdue all their\r\n      adversaries; and their second, that he should bestow an independent\r\n      provision on themselves. As they had generally contributed a good deal to\r\n      the victory, it seemed not unreasonable that they should have some share\r\n      in the spoil. They were weary, besides, of humouring the people, and of\r\n      depending upon their caprice for a subsistence. In making this demand,\r\n      therefore, they consulted their own ease and comfort, without troubling\r\n      themselves about the effect which it might have, in future times, upon the\r\n      influence and authority of their order. The civil magistrate, who could\r\n      comply with their demand only by giving them something which he would have\r\n      chosen much rather to take, or to keep to himself, was seldom very forward\r\n      to grant it. Necessity, however, always forced him to submit at last,\r\n      though frequently not till after many delays, evasions, and affected\r\n      excuses.\r\n\r\n      But if politics had never called in the aid of religion, had the\r\n      conquering party never adopted the tenets of one sect more than those of\r\n      another, when it had gained the victory, it would probably have dealt\r\n      equally and impartially with all the different sects, and have allowed\r\n      every man to choose his own priest, and his own religion, as he thought\r\n      proper. There would, and, in this case, no doubt, have been, a great\r\n      multitude of religious sects. Almost every different congregation might\r\n      probably have had a little sect by itself, or have entertained some\r\n      peculiar tenets of its own. Each teacher, would, no doubt, have felt\r\n      himself under the necessity of making the utmost exertion, and of using\r\n      every art, both to preserve and to increase the number of his disciples.\r\n      But as every other teacher would have felt himself under the same\r\n      necessity, the success of no one teacher, or sect of teachers, could have\r\n      been very great. The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can\r\n      be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect\r\n      tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided\r\n      into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and\r\n      under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be\r\n      altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three\r\n      hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one\r\n      could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The\r\n      teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more\r\n      adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and\r\n      moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those\r\n      great sects, whose tenets, being supported by the civil magistrate, are\r\n      held in veneration by almost all the inhabitants of extensive kingdoms and\r\n      empires, and who, therefore, see nothing round them but followers,\r\n      disciples, and humble admirers. The teachers of each little sect, finding\r\n      themselves almost alone, would be obliged to respect those of almost every\r\n      other sect; and the concessions which they would mutually find it both\r\n      convenient and agreeable to make one to another, might in time, probably\r\n      reduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational\r\n      religion, free from every mixture of absurdity, imposture, or fanaticism,\r\n      such as wise men have, in all ages of the world, wished to see\r\n      established; but such as positive law has, perhaps, never yet established,\r\n      and probably never will establish in any country; because, with regard to\r\n      religion, positive law always has been, and probably always will be, more\r\n      or less influenced by popular superstition and enthusiasm. This plan of\r\n      ecclesiastical government, or, more properly, of no ecclesiastical\r\n      government, was what the sect called Independents (a sect, no doubt, of\r\n      very wild enthusiasts), proposed to establish in England towards the end\r\n      of the civil war. If it had been established, though of a very\r\n      unphilosophical origin, it would probably, by this time, have been\r\n      productive of the most philosophical good temper and moderation with\r\n      regard to every sort of religious principle. It has been established in\r\n      Pennsylvania, where, though the quakers happen to be the most numerous,\r\n      the law, in reality, favours no one sect more than another; and it is\r\n      there said to have been productive of this philosophical good temper and\r\n      moderation.\r\n\r\n      But though this equality of treatment should not be productive of this\r\n      good temper and moderation in all, or even in the greater part of the\r\n      religious sects of a particular country; yet, provided those sects were\r\n      sufficiently numerous, and each of them consequently too small to disturb\r\n      the public tranquillity, the excessive zeal of each for its particular\r\n      tenets could not well be productive of any very hurtful effects, but, on\r\n      the contrary, of several good ones; and if the government was perfectly\r\n      decided, both to let them all alone, and to oblige them all to let alone\r\n      one another, there is little danger that they would not of their own\r\n      accord, subdivide themselves fast enough, so as soon to become\r\n      sufficiently numerous.\r\n\r\n      In every civilized society, in every society where the distinction of\r\n      ranks has once been completely established, there have been always two\r\n      different schemes or systems of morality current at the same time; of\r\n      which the one may be called the strict or austere; the other the liberal,\r\n      or, if you will, the loose system. The former is generally admired and\r\n      revered by the common people; the latter is commonly more esteemed and\r\n      adopted by what are called the people of fashion. The degree of\r\n      disapprobation with which we ought to mark the vices of levity, the vices\r\n      which are apt to arise from great prosperity, and from the excess of\r\n      gaiety and good humour, seems to constitute the principal distinction\r\n      between those two opposite schemes or systems. In the liberal or loose\r\n      system, luxury, wanton, and even disorderly mirth, the pursuit of pleasure\r\n      to some degree of intemperance, the breach of chastity, at least in one of\r\n      the two sexes, etc. provided they are not accompanied with gross\r\n      indecency, and do not lead to falsehood and injustice, are generally\r\n      treated with a good deal of indulgence, and are easily either excused or\r\n      pardoned altogether. In the austere system, on the contrary, those\r\n      excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and detestation. The\r\n      vices of levity are always ruinous to the common people, and a single\r\n      week’s thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor\r\n      workman for ever, and to drive him, through despair, upon committing the\r\n      most enormous crimes. The wiser and better sort of the common people,\r\n      therefore, have always the utmost abhorrence and detestation of such\r\n      excesses, which their experience tells them are so immediately fatal to\r\n      people of their condition. The disorder and extravagance of several years,\r\n      on the contrary, will not always ruin a man of fashion; and people of that\r\n      rank are very apt to consider the power of indulging in some degree of\r\n      excess, as one of the advantages of their fortune; and the liberty of\r\n      doing so without censure or reproach, as one of the privileges which\r\n      belong to their station. In people of their own station, therefore, they\r\n      regard such excesses with but a small degree of disapprobation, and\r\n      censure them either very slightly or not at all.\r\n\r\n      Almost all religious sects have begun among the common people, from whom\r\n      they have generally drawn their earliest, as well as their most numerous\r\n      proselytes. The austere system of morality has, accordingly, been adopted\r\n      by those sects almost constantly, or with very few exceptions; for there\r\n      have been some. It was the system by which they could best recommend\r\n      themselves to that order of people, to whom they first proposed their plan\r\n      of reformation upon what had been before established. Many of them,\r\n      perhaps the greater part of them, have even endeavoured to gain credit by\r\n      refining upon this austere system, and by carrying it to some degree of\r\n      folly and extravagance; and this excessive rigour has frequently\r\n      recommended them, more than any thing else, to the respect and veneration\r\n      of the common people.\r\n\r\n      A man of rank and fortune is, by his station, the distinguished member of\r\n      a great society, who attend to every part of his conduct, and who thereby\r\n      oblige him to attend to every part of it himself. His authority and\r\n      consideration depend very much upon the respect which this society bears\r\n      to him. He dares not do anything which would disgrace or discredit him in\r\n      it; and he is obliged to a very strict observation of that species of\r\n      morals, whether liberal or austere, which the general consent of this\r\n      society prescribes to persons of his rank and fortune. A man of low\r\n      condition, on the contrary, is far from being a distinguished member of\r\n      any great society. While he remains in a country village, his conduct may\r\n      be attended to, and he may be obliged to attend to it himself. In this\r\n      situation, and in this situation only, he may have what is called a\r\n      character to lose. But as soon as he comes into a great city, he is sunk\r\n      in obscurity and darkness. His conduct is observed and attended to by\r\n      nobody; and he is, therefore, very likely to neglect it himself, and to\r\n      abandon himself to every sort of low profligacy and vice. He never emerges\r\n      so effectually from this obscurity, his conduct never excites so much the\r\n      attention of any respectable society, as by his becoming the member of a\r\n      small religious sect. He from that moment acquires a degree of\r\n      consideration which he never had before. All his brother sectaries are,\r\n      for the credit of the sect, interested to observe his conduct; and, if he\r\n      gives occasion to any scandal, if he deviates very much from those austere\r\n      morals which they almost always require of one another, to punish him by\r\n      what is always a very severe punishment, even where no evil effects attend\r\n      it, expulsion or excommunication from the sect. In little religious sects,\r\n      accordingly, the morals of the common people have been almost always\r\n      remarkably regular and orderly; generally much more so than in the\r\n      established church. The morals of those little sects, indeed, have\r\n      frequently been rather disagreeably rigorous and unsocial.\r\n\r\n      There are two very easy and effectual remedies, however, by whose joint\r\n      operation the state might, without violence, correct whatever was unsocial\r\n      or disagreeably rigorous in the morals of all the little sects into which\r\n      the country was divided.\r\n\r\n      The first of those remedies is the study of science and philosophy, which\r\n      the state might render almost universal among all people of middling or\r\n      more than middling rank and fortune; not by giving salaries to teachers in\r\n      order to make them negligent and idle, but by instituting some sort of\r\n      probation, even in the higher and more difficult sciences, to be undergone\r\n      by every person before he was permitted to exercise any liberal\r\n      profession, or before he could be received as a candidate for any\r\n      honourable office, of trust or profit. If the state imposed upon this\r\n      order of men the necessity of learning, it would have no occasion to give\r\n      itself any trouble about providing them with proper teachers. They would\r\n      soon find better teachers for themselves, than any whom the state could\r\n      provide for them. Science is the great antidote to the poison of\r\n      enthusiasm and superstition; and where all the superior ranks of people\r\n      were secured from it, the inferior ranks could not be much exposed to it.\r\n\r\n      The second of those remedies is the frequency and gaiety of public\r\n      diversions. The state, by encouraging, that is, by giving entire liberty\r\n      to all those who, from their own interest, would attempt, without scandal\r\n      or indecency, to amuse and divert the people by painting, poetry, music,\r\n      dancing; by all sorts of dramatic representations and exhibitions; would\r\n      easily dissipate, in the greater part of them, that melancholy and gloomy\r\n      humour which is almost always the nurse of popular superstition and\r\n      enthusiasm. Public diversions have always been the objects of dread and\r\n      hatred to all the fanatical promoters of those popular frenzies. The\r\n      gaiety and good humour which those diversions inspire, were altogether\r\n      inconsistent with that temper of mind which was fittest for their purpose,\r\n      or which they could best work upon. Dramatic representations, besides,\r\n      frequently exposing their artifices to public ridicule, and sometimes even\r\n      to public execration, were, upon that account, more than all other\r\n      diversions, the objects of their peculiar abhorrence.\r\n\r\n      In a country where the law favoured the teachers of no one religion more\r\n      than those of another, it would not be necessary that any of them should\r\n      have any particular or immediate dependency upon the sovereign or\r\n      executive power; or that he should have anything to do either in\r\n      appointing or in dismissing them from their offices. In such a situation,\r\n      he would have no occasion to give himself any concern about them, further\r\n      than to keep the peace among them, in the same manner as among the rest of\r\n      his subjects, that is, to hinder them from persecuting, abusing, or\r\n      oppressing one another. But it is quite otherwise in countries where there\r\n      is an established or governing religion. The sovereign can in this case\r\n      never be secure, unless he has the means of influencing in a considerable\r\n      degree the greater part of the teachers of that religion.\r\n\r\n      The clergy of every established church constitute a great incorporation.\r\n      They can act in concert, and pursue their interest upon one plan, and with\r\n      one spirit as much as if they were under the direction of one man; and\r\n      they are frequently, too, under such direction. Their interest as an\r\n      incorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign, and is\r\n      sometimes directly opposite to it. Their great interest is to maintain\r\n      their authority with the people, and this authority depends upon the\r\n      supposed certainty and importance of the whole doctrine which they\r\n      inculcate, and upon the supposed necessity of adopting every part of it\r\n      with the most implicit faith, in order to avoid eternal misery. Should the\r\n      sovereign have the imprudence to appear either to deride, or doubt himself\r\n      of the most trifling part of their doctrine, or from humanity, attempt to\r\n      protect those who did either the one or the other, the punctilious honour\r\n      of a clergy, who have no sort of dependency upon him, is immediately\r\n      provoked to proscribe him as a profane person, and to employ all the\r\n      terrors of religion, in order to oblige the people to transfer their\r\n      allegiance to some more orthodox and obedient prince. Should he oppose any\r\n      of their pretensions or usurpations, the danger is equally great. The\r\n      princes who have dared in this manner to rebel against the church, over\r\n      and above this crime of rebellion, have generally been charged, too, with\r\n      the additional crime of heresy, notwithstanding their solemn protestations\r\n      of their faith, and humble submission to every tenet which she thought\r\n      proper to prescribe to them. But the authority of religion is superior to\r\n      every other authority. The fears which it suggests conquer all other\r\n      fears. When the authorized teachers of religion propagate through the\r\n      great body of the people, doctrines subversive of the authority of the\r\n      sovereign, it is by violence only, or by the force of a standing army,\r\n      that he can maintain his authority. Even a standing army cannot in this\r\n      case give him any lasting security; because if the soldiers are not\r\n      foreigners, which can seldom be the case, but drawn from the great body of\r\n      the people, which must almost always be the case, they are likely to be\r\n      soon corrupted by those very doctrines. The revolutions which the\r\n      turbulence of the Greek clergy was continually occasioning at\r\n      Constantinople, as long as the eastern empire subsisted; the convulsions\r\n      which, during the course of several centuries, the turbulence of the Roman\r\n      clergy was continually occasioning in every part of Europe, sufficiently\r\n      demonstrate how precarious and insecure must always be the situation of\r\n      the sovereign, who has no proper means of influencing the clergy of the\r\n      established and governing religion of his country.\r\n\r\n      Articles of faith, as well as all other spiritual matters, it is evident\r\n      enough, are not within the proper department of a temporal sovereign, who,\r\n      though he may be very well qualified for protecting, is seldom supposed to\r\n      be so for instructing the people. With regard to such matters, therefore,\r\n      his authority can seldom be sufficient to counterbalance the united\r\n      authority of the clergy of the established church. The public\r\n      tranquillity, however, and his own security, may frequently depend upon\r\n      the doctrines which they may think proper to propagate concerning such\r\n      matters. As he can seldom directly oppose their decision, therefore, with\r\n      proper weight and authority, it is necessary that he should be able to\r\n      influence it; and he can influence it only by the fears and expectations\r\n      which he may excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order.\r\n      Those fears and expectations may consist in the fear of deprivation or\r\n      other punishment, and in the expectation of further preferment.\r\n\r\n      In all Christian churches, the benefices of the clergy are a sort of\r\n      freeholds, which they enjoy, not during pleasure, but during life or good\r\n      behaviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were liable\r\n      to be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the sovereign\r\n      or of his ministers, it would perhaps be impossible for them to maintain\r\n      their authority with the people, who would then consider them as mercenary\r\n      dependents upon the court, in the sincerity of whose instructions they\r\n      could no longer have any confidence. But should the sovereign attempt\r\n      irregularly, and by violence, to deprive any number of clergymen of their\r\n      freeholds, on account, perhaps, of their having propagated, with more than\r\n      ordinary zeal, some factious or seditious doctrine, he would only render,\r\n      by such persecution, both them and their doctrine ten times more popular,\r\n      and therefore ten times more troublesome and dangerous, than they had been\r\n      before. Fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of govermnent,\r\n      and ought in particular never to be employed against any order of men who\r\n      have the smallest pretensions to independency. To attempt to terrify them,\r\n      serves only to irritate their bad humour, and to confirm them in an\r\n      opposition, which more gentle usage, perhaps, might easily induce them\r\n      either to soften, or to lay aside altogether. The violence which the\r\n      French government usually employed in order to oblige all their\r\n      parliaments, or sovereign courts of justice, to enregister any unpopular\r\n      edict, very seldom succeeded. The means commonly employed, however, the\r\n      imprisonment of all the refractory members, one would think, were forcible\r\n      enough. The princes of the house of Stuart sometimes employed the like\r\n      means in order to influence some of the members of the parliament of\r\n      England, and they generally found them equally intractable. The parliament\r\n      of England is now managed in another manner; and a very small experiment,\r\n      which the duke of Choiseul made, about twelve years ago, upon the\r\n      parliament of Paris, demonstrated sufficiently that all the parliaments of\r\n      France might have been managed still more easily in the same manner. That\r\n      experiment was not pursued. For though management and persuasion are\r\n      always the easiest and safest instruments of government as force and\r\n      violence are the worst and the most dangerous; yet such, it seems, is the\r\n      natural insolence of man, that he almost always disdains to use the good\r\n      instrument, except when he cannot or dare not use the bad one. The French\r\n      government could and durst use force, and therefore disdained to use\r\n      management and persuasion. But there is no order of men, it appears I\r\n      believe, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is so dangerous or\r\n      rather so perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violence, as upon the\r\n      respected clergy of an established church. The rights, the privileges, the\r\n      personal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic, who is upon good terms\r\n      with his own order, are, even in the most despotic governments, more\r\n      respected than those of any other person of nearly equal rank and fortune.\r\n      It is so in every gradation of despotism, from that of the gentle and mild\r\n      government of Paris, to that of the violent and furious government of\r\n      Constantinople. But though this order of men can scarce ever be forced,\r\n      they may be managed as easily as any other; and the security of the\r\n      sovereign, as well as the public tranquillity, seems to depend very much\r\n      upon the means which he has of managing them; and those means seem to\r\n      consist altogether in the preferment which he has to bestow upon them.\r\n\r\n      In the ancient constitution of the Christian church, the bishop of each\r\n      diocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of\r\n      the episcopal city. The people did not long retain their right of\r\n      election; and while they did retain it, they almost always acted under the\r\n      influence of the clergy, who, in such spiritual matters, appeared to be\r\n      their natural guides. The clergy, however, soon grew weary of the trouble\r\n      of managing them, and found it easier to elect their own bishops\r\n      themselves. The abbot, in the same manner, was elected by the monks of the\r\n      monastery, at least in the greater part of abbacies. All the inferior\r\n      ecclesiastical benefices comprehended within the diocese were collated by\r\n      the bishop, who bestowed them upon such ecclesiastics as he thought\r\n      proper. All church preferments were in this manner in the disposal of the\r\n      church. The sovereign, though he might have some indirect influence in\r\n      those elections, and though it was sometimes usual to ask both his consent\r\n      to elect, and his approbation of the election, yet had no direct or\r\n      sufficient means of managing the clergy. The ambition of every clergyman\r\n      naturally led him to pay court, not so much to his sovereign as to his own\r\n      order, from which only he could expect preferment.\r\n\r\n      Through the greater part of Europe, the pope gradually drew to himself,\r\n      first the collation of almost all bishoprics and abbacies, or of what were\r\n      called consistorial benefices, and afterwards, by various machinations and\r\n      pretences, of the greater part of inferior benefices comprehended within\r\n      each diocese, little more being left to the bishop than what was barely\r\n      necessary to give him a decent authority with his own clergy. By this\r\n      arrangement the condition of the sovereign was still worse than it had\r\n      been before. The clergy of all the different countries of Europe were thus\r\n      formed into a sort of spiritual army, dispersed in different quarters\r\n      indeed, but of which all the movements and operations could now be\r\n      directed by one head, and conducted upon one uniform plan. The clergy of\r\n      each particular country might be considered as a particular detachment of\r\n      that army, of which the operations could easily be supported and seconded\r\n      by all the other detachments quartered in the different countries round\r\n      about. Each detachment was not only independent of the sovereign of the\r\n      country in which it was quartered, and by which it was maintained, but\r\n      dependent upon a foreign sovereign, who could at any time turn its arms\r\n      against the sovereign of that particular country, and support them by the\r\n      arms of all the other detachments.\r\n\r\n      Those arms were the most formidable that can well be imagined. In the\r\n      ancient state of Europe, before the establishment of arts and\r\n      manufactures, the wealth of the clergy gave them the same sort of\r\n      influence over the common people which that of the great barons gave them\r\n      over their respective vassals, tenants, and retainers. In the great landed\r\n      estates, which the mistaken piety both of princes and private persons had\r\n      bestowed upon the church, jurisdictions were established, of the same kind\r\n      with those of the great barons, and for the same reason. In those great\r\n      landed estates, the clergy, or their bailiffs, could easily keep the\r\n      peace, without the support or assistance either of the king or of any\r\n      other person; and neither the king nor any other person could keep the\r\n      peace there without the support and assistance of the clergy. The\r\n      jurisdictions of the clergy, therefore, in their particular baronies or\r\n      manors, were equally independent, and equally exclusive of the authority\r\n      of the king’s courts, as those of the great temporal lords. The tenants of\r\n      the clergy were, like those of the great barons, almost all tenants at\r\n      will, entirely dependent upon their immediate lords, and, therefore,\r\n      liable to be called out at pleasure, in order to fight in any quarrel in\r\n      which the clergy might think proper to engage them. Over and above the\r\n      rents of those estates, the clergy possessed in the tithes a very large\r\n      portion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of Europe.\r\n      The revenues arising from both those species of rents were, the greater\r\n      part of them, paid in kind, in corn, wine, cattle, poultry, etc. The\r\n      quantity exceeded greatly what the clergy could themselves consume; and\r\n      there were neither arts nor manufactures, for the produce of which they\r\n      could exchange the surplus. The clergy could derive advantage from this\r\n      immense surplus in no other way than by employing it, as the great barons\r\n      employed the like surplus of their revenues, in the most profuse\r\n      hospitality, and in the most extensive charity. Both the hospitality and\r\n      the charity of the ancient clergy, accordingly, are said to have been very\r\n      great. They not only maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom,\r\n      but many knights and gentlemen had frequently no other means of\r\n      subsistence than by travelling about from monastery to monastery, under\r\n      pretence of devotion, but in reality to enjoy the hospitality of the\r\n      clergy. The retainers of some particular prelates were often as numerous\r\n      as those of the greatest lay-lords; and the retainers of all the clergy\r\n      taken together were, perhaps, more numerous than those of all the\r\n      lay-lords. There was always much more union among the clergy than among\r\n      the lay-lords. The former were under a regular discipline and\r\n      subordination to the papal authority. The latter were under no regular\r\n      discipline or subordination, but almost always equally jealous of one\r\n      another, and of the king. Though the tenants and retainers of the clergy,\r\n      therefore, had both together been less numerous than those of the great\r\n      lay-lords, and their tenants were probably much less numerous, yet their\r\n      union would have rendered them more formidable. The hospitality and\r\n      charity of the clergy, too, not only gave them the command of a great\r\n      temporal force, but increased very much the weight of their spiritual\r\n      weapons. Those virtues procured them the highest respect and veneration\r\n      among all the inferior ranks of people, of whom many were constantly, and\r\n      almost all occasionally, fed by them. Everything belonging or related to\r\n      so popular an order, its possessions, its privileges, its doctrines,\r\n      necessarily appeared sacred in the eyes of the common people; and every\r\n      violation of them, whether real or pretended, the highest act of\r\n      sacrilegious wickedness and profaneness. In this state of things, if the\r\n      sovereign frequently found it difficult to resist the confederacy of a few\r\n      of the great nobility, we cannot wonder that he should find it still more\r\n      so to resist the united force of the clergy of his own dominions,\r\n      supported by that of the clergy of all the neighbouring dominions. In such\r\n      circumstances, the wonder is, not that he was sometimes obliged to yield,\r\n      but that he ever was able to resist.\r\n\r\n      The privileges of the clergy in those ancient times (which to us, who live\r\n      in the present times, appear the most absurd), their total exemption from\r\n      the secular jurisdiction, for example, or what in England was called the\r\n      benefit of clergy, were the natural, or rather the necessary, consequences\r\n      of this state of things. How dangerous must it have been for the sovereign\r\n      to attempt to punish a clergyman for any crime whatever, if his order were\r\n      disposed to protect him, and to represent either the proof as insufficient\r\n      for convicting so holy a man, or the punishment as too severe to be\r\n      inflicted upon one whose person had been rendered sacred by religion? The\r\n      sovereign could, in such circumstances, do no better than leave him to be\r\n      tried by the ecclesiastical courts, who, for the honour of their own\r\n      order, were interested to restrain, as much as possible, every member of\r\n      it from committing enormous crimes, or even from giving occasion to such\r\n      gross scandal as might disgust the minds of the people.\r\n\r\n      In the state in which things were, through the greater part of Europe,\r\n      during the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, and for\r\n      some time both before and after that period, the constitution of the\r\n      church of Rome may be considered as the most formidable combination that\r\n      ever was formed against the authority and security of civil government, as\r\n      well as against the liberty, reason, and happiness of mankind, which can\r\n      flourish only where civil government is able to protect them. In that\r\n      constitution, the grossest delusions of superstition were supported in\r\n      such a manner by the private interests of so great a number of people, as\r\n      put them out of all danger from any assault of human reason; because,\r\n      though human reason might, perhaps, have been able to unveil, even to the\r\n      eyes of the common people, some of the delusions of superstition, it could\r\n      never have dissolved the ties of private interest. Had this constitution\r\n      been attacked by no other enemies but the feeble efforts of human reason,\r\n      it must have endured for ever. But that immense and well-built fabric,\r\n      which all the wisdom and virtue of man could never have shaken, much less\r\n      have overturned, was, by the natural course of things, first weakened, and\r\n      afterwards in part destroyed; and is now likely, in the course of a few\r\n      centuries more, perhaps, to crumble into ruins altogether.\r\n\r\n      The gradual improvements of arts, manufactures, and commerce, the\r\n      same causes which destroyed the power of the great barons, destroyed,\r\n      in the same manner, through the greater part of Europe, the whole\r\n      temporal power of the clergy. In the produce of arts, manufactures, and\r\n      commerce, the clergy, like the great barons, found something for which\r\n      they could exchange their rude produce, and thereby discovered the\r\n      means of spending their whole revenues upon their own persons, without\r\n      giving any considerable share of them to other people. Their charity\r\n      became gradually less extensive, their hospitality less liberal, or\r\n      less profuse. Their retainers became consequently less numerous, and,\r\n      by degrees, dwindled away altogether. The clergy, too, like the great\r\n      barons, wished to get a better rent from their landed estates, in order\r\n      to spend it, in the same manner, upon the gratification of their own\r\n      private vanity and folly. But this increase of rent could be got only\r\n      by granting leases to their tenants, who thereby became, in a great\r\n      measure, independent of them. The ties of interest, which bound the\r\n      inferior ranks of people to the clergy, were in this manner gradually\r\n      broken and dissolved. They were even broken and dissolved sooner than\r\n      those which bound the same ranks of people to the great barons; because\r\n      the benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much smaller\r\n      than the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each benefice was\r\n      much sooner able to spend the whole of its revenue upon his own person.\r\n      During the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the\r\n      power of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in\r\n      full vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the absolute command\r\n      which they had once had over the great body of the people was very much\r\n      decayed. The power of the church was, by that time, very nearly reduced,\r\n      through the greater part of Europe, to what arose from their spiritual\r\n      authority; and even that spiritual authority was much weakened, when it\r\n      ceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy. The\r\n      inferior ranks of people no longer looked upon that order as they had\r\n      done before; as the comforters of their distress, and the relievers of\r\n      their indigence. On the contrary, they were provoked and disgusted by the\r\n      vanity, luxury, and expense of the richer clergy, who appeared to spend\r\n      upon their own pleasures what had always before been regarded as the\r\n      patrimony of the poor.\r\n\r\n      In this situation of things, the sovereigns in the different states of\r\n      Europe endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had in the\r\n      disposal of the great benefices of the church; by procuring to the deans\r\n      and chapters of each diocese the restoration of their ancient right of\r\n      electing the bishop; and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the\r\n      abbot. The re-establishing this ancient order was the object of several\r\n      statutes enacted in England during the course of the fourteenth century,\r\n      particularly of what is called the statute of provisors; and of the\r\n      pragmatic sanction, established in France in the fifteenth century. In\r\n      order to render the election valid, it was necessary that the sovereign\r\n      should both consent to it before hand, and afterwards approve of the\r\n      person elected; and though the election was still supposed to be free, he\r\n      had, however all the indirect means which his situation necessarily\r\n      afforded him, of influencing the clergy in his own dominions. Other\r\n      regulations, of a similar tendency, were established in other parts of\r\n      Europe. But the power of the pope, in the collation of the great benefices\r\n      of the church, seems, before the reformation, to have been nowhere so\r\n      effectually and so universally restrained as in France and England. The\r\n      concordat afterwards, in the sixteenth century, gave to the kings of\r\n      France the absolute right of presenting to all the great, or what are\r\n      called the consistorial, benefices of the Gallican church.\r\n\r\n      Since the establishment of the pragmatic sanction and of the concordat,\r\n      the clergy of France have in general shewn less respect to the decrees of\r\n      the papal court, than the clergy of any other catholic country. In all the\r\n      disputes which their sovereign has had with the pope, they have almost\r\n      constantly taken part with the former. This independency of the clergy of\r\n      France upon the court of Rome seems to be principally founded upon the\r\n      pragmatic sanction and the concordat. In the earlier periods of the\r\n      monarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much devoted to the\r\n      pope as those of any other country. When Robert, the second prince of the\r\n      Capetian race, was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of Rome, his\r\n      own servants, it is said, threw the victuals which came from his table to\r\n      the dogs, and refused to taste any thing themselves which had been\r\n      polluted by the contact of a person in his situation. They were taught to\r\n      do so, it may very safely be presumed, by the clergy of his own dominions.\r\n\r\n      The claim of collating to the great benefices of the church, a claim in\r\n      defence of which the court of Rome had frequently shaken, and sometimes\r\n      overturned, the thrones of some of the greatest sovereigns in Christendom,\r\n      was in this manner either restrained or modified, or given up altogether,\r\n      in many different parts of Europe, even before the time of the\r\n      reformation. As the clergy had now less influence over the people, so the\r\n      state had more influence over the clergy. The clergy, therefore, had both\r\n      less power, and less inclination, to disturb the state.\r\n\r\n      The authority of the church of Rome was in this state of declension, when\r\n      the disputes which gave birth to the reformation began in Germany, and\r\n      soon spread themselves through every part of Europe. The new doctrines\r\n      were everywhere received with a high degree of popular favour. They were\r\n      propagated with all that enthusiastic zeal which commonly animates the\r\n      spirit of party, when it attacks established authority. The teachers of\r\n      those doctrines, though perhaps, in other respects, not more learned than\r\n      many of the divines who defended the established church, seem in general\r\n      to have been better acquainted with ecclesiastical history, and with the\r\n      origin and progress of that system of opinions upon which the authority of\r\n      the church was established; and they had thereby the advantage in almost\r\n      every dispute. The austerity of their manners gave them authority with the\r\n      common people, who contrasted the strict regularity of their conduct with\r\n      the disorderly lives of the greater part of their own clergy. They\r\n      possessed, too, in a much higher degree than their adversaries, all the\r\n      arts of popularity and of gaining proselytes; arts which the lofty and\r\n      dignified sons of the church had long neglected, as being to them in a\r\n      great measure useless. The reason of the new doctrines recommended them to\r\n      some, their novelty to many; the hatred and contempt of the established\r\n      clergy to a still greater number: but the zealous, passionate, and\r\n      fanatical, though frequently coarse and rustic eloquence, with which they\r\n      were almost everywhere inculcated, recommended them to by far the greatest\r\n      number.\r\n\r\n      The success of the new doctrines was almost everywhere so great, that the\r\n      princes, who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court of\r\n      Rome, were, by means of them, easily enabled, in their own dominions, to\r\n      overturn the church, which having lost the respect and veneration of the\r\n      inferior ranks of people, could make scarce any resistance. The court of\r\n      Rome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the northern parts of\r\n      Germany, whom it had probably considered as too insignificant to be worth\r\n      the managing. They universally, therefore, established the reformation in\r\n      their own dominions. The tyranny of Christiern II., and of Troll\r\n      archbishop of Upsal, enabled Gustavus Vasa to expel them both from Sweden.\r\n      The pope favoured the tyrant and the archbishop, and Gustavus Vasa found\r\n      no difficulty in establishing the reformation in Sweden. Christiern II.\r\n      was afterwards deposed from the throne of Denmark, where his conduct had\r\n      rendered him as odious as in Sweden. The pope, however, was still disposed\r\n      to favour him; and Frederic of Holstein, who had mounted the throne in his\r\n      stead, revenged himself, by following the example of Gustavus Vasa. The\r\n      magistrates of Berne and Zurich, who had no particular quarrel with the\r\n      pope, established with great ease the reformation in their respective\r\n      cantons, where just before some of the clergy had, by an imposture\r\n      somewhat grosser than ordinary, rendered the whole order both odious and\r\n      contemptible.\r\n\r\n      In this critical situation of its affairs the papal court was at\r\n      sufficient pains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of\r\n      France and Spain, of whom the latter was at that time emperor of Germany.\r\n      With their assistance, it was enabled, though not without great\r\n      difficulty, and much bloodshed, either to suppress altogether, or to\r\n      obstruct very much, the progress of the reformation in their dominions. It\r\n      was well enough inclined, too, to be complaisant to the king of England.\r\n      But from the circumstances of the times, it could not be so without giving\r\n      offence to a still greater sovereign, Charles V., king of Spain and\r\n      emperor of Germany. Henry VIII., accordingly, though he did not embrace\r\n      himself the greater part of the doctrines of the reformation, was yet\r\n      enabled, by their general prevalence, to suppress all the monasteries, and\r\n      to abolish the authority of the church of Rome in his dominions. That he\r\n      should go so far, though he went no further, gave some satisfaction to the\r\n      patrons of the reformation, who, having got possession of the government\r\n      in the reign of his son and successor completed, without any difficulty,\r\n      the work which Henry VIII. had begun.\r\n\r\n      In some countries, as in Scotland, where the government was weak,\r\n      unpopular, and not very firmly established, the reformation was strong\r\n      enough to overturn, not only the church, but the state likewise, for\r\n      attempting to support the church.\r\n\r\n      Among the followers of the reformation, dispersed in all the different\r\n      countries of Europe, there was no general tribunal, which, like that of\r\n      the court of Rome, or an oecumenical council, could settle all disputes\r\n      among them, and, with irresistible authority, prescribe to all of them the\r\n      precise limits of orthodoxy. When the followers of the reformation in one\r\n      country, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in another, as\r\n      they had no common judge to appeal to, the dispute could never be decided;\r\n      and many such disputes arose among them. Those concerning the government\r\n      of the church, and the right of conferring ecclesiastical benefices, were\r\n      perhaps the most interesting to the peace and welfare of civil society.\r\n      They gave birth, accordingly, to the two principal parties or sects among\r\n      the followers of the reformation, the Lutheran and Calvinistic sects, the\r\n      only sects among them, of which the doctrine and discipline have ever yet\r\n      been established by law in any part of Europe.\r\n\r\n      The followers of Luther, together with what is called the church of\r\n      England, preserved more or less of the episcopal government, established\r\n      subordination among the clergy, gave the sovereign the disposal of all the\r\n      bishoprics, and other consistorial benefices within his dominions, and\r\n      thereby rendered him the real head of the church; and without depriving\r\n      the bishop of the right of collating to the smaller benefices within his\r\n      diocese, they, even to those benefices, not only admitted, but favoured\r\n      the right of presentation, both in the sovereign and in all other lay\r\n      patrons. This system of church government was, from the beginning,\r\n      favourable to peace and good order, and to submission to the civil\r\n      sovereign. It has never, accordingly, been the occasion of any tumult or\r\n      civil commotion in any country in which it has once been established. The\r\n      church of England, in particular, has always valued herself, with great\r\n      reason, upon the unexceptionable loyalty of her principles. Under such a\r\n      government, the clergy naturally endeavour to recommend themselves to the\r\n      sovereign, to the court, and to the nobility and gentry of the country, by\r\n      whose influence they chiefly expect to obtain preferment. They pay court\r\n      to those patrons, sometimes, no doubt, by the vilest flattery and\r\n      assentation; but frequently, too, by cultivating all those arts which best\r\n      deserve, and which are therefore most likely to gain them, the esteem of\r\n      people of rank and fortune; by their knowledge in all the different\r\n      branches of useful and ornamental learning, by the decent liberality of\r\n      their manners, by the social good humour of their conversation, and by\r\n      their avowed contempt of those absurd and hypocritical austerities which\r\n      fanatics inculcate and pretend to practise, in order to draw upon\r\n      themselves the veneration, and upon the greater part of men of rank and\r\n      fortune, who avow that they do not practise them, the abhorrence of the\r\n      common people. Such a clergy, however, while they pay their court in this\r\n      manner to the higher ranks of life, are very apt to neglect altogether the\r\n      means of maintaining their influence and authority with the lower. They\r\n      are listened to, esteemed, and respected by their superiors; but before\r\n      their inferiors they are frequently incapable of defending, effectually,\r\n      and to the conviction of such hearers, their own sober and moderate\r\n      doctrines, against the most ignorant enthusiast who chooses to attack\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      The followers of Zuinglius, or more properly those of Calvin, on the\r\n      contrary, bestowed upon the people of each parish, whenever the church\r\n      became vacant, the right of electing their own pastor; and established, at\r\n      the same time, the most perfect equality among the clergy. The former part\r\n      of this institution, as long as it remained in vigour, seems to have been\r\n      productive of nothing but disorder and confusion, and to have tended\r\n      equally to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the people. The\r\n      latter part seems never to have had any effects but what were perfectly\r\n      agreeable.\r\n\r\n      As long as the people of each parish preserved the right of electing their\r\n      own pastors, they acted almost always under the influence of the clergy,\r\n      and generally of the most factious and fanatical of the order. The clergy,\r\n      in order to preserve their influence in those popular elections, became,\r\n      or affected to become, many of them, fanatics themselves, encouraged\r\n      fanaticism among the people, and gave the preference almost always to the\r\n      most fanatical candidate. So small a matter as the appointment of a parish\r\n      priest, occasioned almost always a violent contest, not only in one\r\n      parish, but in all the neighbouring parishes who seldom failed to take\r\n      part in the quarrel. When the parish happened to be situated in a great\r\n      city, it divided all the inhabitants into two parties; and when that city\r\n      happened, either to constitute itself a little republic, or to be the head\r\n      and capital of a little republic, as in the case with many of the\r\n      considerable cities in Switzerland and Holland, every paltry dispute of\r\n      this kind, over and above exasperating the animosity of all their other\r\n      factions, threatened to leave behind it, both a new schism in the church,\r\n      and a new faction in the state. In those small republics, therefore, the\r\n      magistrate very soon found it necessary, for the sake of preserving the\r\n      public peace, to assume to himself the right of presenting to all vacant\r\n      benefices. In Scotland, the most extensive country in which this\r\n      presbyterian form of church government has ever been established, the\r\n      rights of patronage were in effect abolished by the act which established\r\n      presbytery in the beginning of the reign of William III. That act, at\r\n      least, put in the power of certain classes of people in each parish to\r\n      purchase, for a very small price, the right of electing their own pastor.\r\n      The constitution which this act established, was allowed to subsist for\r\n      about two-and-twenty years, but was abolished by the 10th of queen Anne,\r\n      ch.12, on account of the confusions and disorders which this more popular\r\n      mode of election had almost everywhere occasioned. In so extensive a\r\n      country as Scotland, however, a tumult in a remote parish was not so\r\n      likely to give disturbance to government as in a smaller state. The 10th\r\n      of queen Anne restored the rights of patronage. But though, in Scotland,\r\n      the law gives the benefice, without any exception to the person presented\r\n      by the patron; yet the church requires sometimes (for she has not in this\r\n      respect been very uniform in her decisions) a certain concurrence of the\r\n      people, before she will confer upon the presentee what is called the cure\r\n      of souls, or the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the parish. She sometimes,\r\n      at least, from an affected concern for the peace of the parish, delays the\r\n      settlement till this concurrence can be procured. The private tampering of\r\n      some of the neighbouring clergy, sometimes to procure, but more frequently\r\n      to prevent this concurrence, and the popular arts which they cultivate, in\r\n      order to enable them upon such occasions to tamper more effectually, are\r\n      perhaps the causes which principally keep up whatever remains of the old\r\n      fanatical spirit, either in the clergy or in the people of Scotland.\r\n\r\n      The equality which the presbyterian form of church government establishes\r\n      among the clergy, consists, first, in the equality of authority or\r\n      ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and, secondly, in the equality of benefice.\r\n      In all presbyterian churches, the equality of authority is perfect; that\r\n      of benefice is not so. The difference, however, between one benefice and\r\n      another, is seldom so considerable, as commonly to tempt the possessor\r\n      even of the small one to pay court to his patron, by the vile arts of\r\n      flattery and assentation, in order to get a better. In all the\r\n      presbyterian churches, where the rights of patronage are thoroughly\r\n      established, it is by nobler and better arts, that the established clergy\r\n      in general endeavour to gain the favour of their superiors; by their\r\n      learning, by the irreproachable regularity of their life, and by the\r\n      faithful and diligent discharge of their duty. Their patrons even\r\n      frequently complain of the independency of their spirit, which they are\r\n      apt to construe into ingratitude for past favours, but which, at worse,\r\n      perhaps, is seldom anymore than that indifference which naturally arises\r\n      from the consciousness that no further favours of the kind are ever to be\r\n      expected. There is scarce, perhaps, to be found anywhere in Europe, a more\r\n      learned, decent, independent, and respectable set of men, than the greater\r\n      part of the presbyterian clergy of Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, and\r\n      Scotland.\r\n\r\n      Where the church benefices are all nearly equal, none of them can be very\r\n      great; and this mediocrity of benefice, though it may be, no doubt,\r\n      carried too far, has, however, some very agreeable effects. Nothing but\r\n      exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune. The vices of\r\n      levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and are, besides,\r\n      almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people. In his own\r\n      conduct, therefore, he is obliged to follow that system of morals which\r\n      the common people respect the most. He gains their esteem and affection,\r\n      by that plan of life which his own interest and situation would lead him\r\n      to follow. The common people look upon him with that kindness with which\r\n      we naturally regard one who approaches somewhat to our own condition, but\r\n      who, we think, ought to be in a higher. Their kindness naturally provokes\r\n      his kindness. He becomes careful to instruct them, and attentive to assist\r\n      and relieve them. He does not even despise the prejudices of people who\r\n      are disposed to be so favourable to him, and never treats them with those\r\n      contemptuous and arrogant airs, which we so often meet with in the proud\r\n      dignitaries of opulent and well endowed churches. The presbyterian clergy,\r\n      accordingly, have more influence over the minds of the common people, than\r\n      perhaps the clergy of any other established church. It is, accordingly, in\r\n      presbyterian countries only, that we ever find the common people\r\n      converted, without persecution completely, and almost to a man, to the\r\n      established church.\r\n\r\n      In countries where church benefices are, the greater part of them, very\r\n      moderate, a chair in a university is generally a better establishment than\r\n      a church benefice. The universities have, in this case, the picking and\r\n      chusing of their members from all the churchmen of the country, who, in\r\n      every country, constitute by far the most numerous class of men of\r\n      letters. Where church benefices, on the contrary, are many of them very\r\n      considerable, the church naturally draws from the universities the greater\r\n      part of their eminent men of letters; who generally find some patron, who\r\n      does himself honour by procuring them church preferment. In the former\r\n      situation, we are likely to find the universities filled with the most\r\n      eminent men of letters that are to be found in the country. In the latter,\r\n      we are likely to find few eminent men among them, and those few among the\r\n      youngest members of the society, who are likely, too, to be drained away\r\n      from it, before they can have acquired experience and knowledge enough to\r\n      be of much use to it. It is observed by Mr de Voltaire, that father\r\n      Porée, a jesuit of no great eminence in the republic of letters, was the\r\n      only professor they had ever had in France, whose works were worth the\r\n      reading. In a country which has produced so many eminent men of letters,\r\n      it must appear somewhat singular, that scarce one of them should have been\r\n      a professor in a university. The famous Cassendi was, in the beginning of\r\n      his life, a professor in the university of Aix. Upon the first dawning of\r\n      his genius, it was represented to him, that by going into the church he\r\n      could easily find a much more quiet and comfortable subsistence, as well\r\n      as a better situation for pursuing his studies; and he immediately\r\n      followed the advice. The observation of Mr de Voltaire may be applied, I\r\n      believe, not only to France, but to all other Roman Catholic countries. We\r\n      very rarely find in any of them an eminent man of letters, who is a\r\n      professor in a university, except, perhaps, in the professions of law and\r\n      physic; professions from which the church is not so likely to draw them.\r\n      After the church of Rome, that of England is by far the richest and best\r\n      endowed church in Christendom. In England, accordingly, the church is\r\n      continually draining the universities of all their best and ablest\r\n      members; and an old college tutor who is known and distinguished in Europe\r\n      as an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to be found there as in any\r\n      Roman catholic country. In Geneva, on the contrary, in the protestant\r\n      cantons of Switzerland, in the protestant countries of Germany, in\r\n      Holland, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the most eminent men of\r\n      letters whom those countries have produced, have, not all indeed, but the\r\n      far greater part of them, been professors in universities. In those\r\n      countries, the universities are continually draining the church of all its\r\n      most eminent men of letters.\r\n\r\n      It may, perhaps, be worth while to remark, that, if we except the poets, a\r\n      few orators, and a few historians, the far greater part of the other\r\n      eminent men of letters, both of Greece and Rome, appear to have been\r\n      either public or private teachers; generally either of philosophy or of\r\n      rhetoric. This remark will be found to hold true, from the days of Lysias\r\n      and Isocrates, of Plato and Aristotle, down to those of Plutarch and\r\n      Epictetus, Suetonius, and Quintilian. To impose upon any man the necessity\r\n      of teaching, year after year, in any particular branch of science seems in\r\n      reality to be the most effectual method for rendering him completely\r\n      master of it himself. By being obliged to go every year over the same\r\n      ground, if he is good for any thing, he necessarily becomes, in a few\r\n      years, well acquainted with every part of it, and if, upon any particular\r\n      point, he should form too hasty an opinion one year, when he comes, in the\r\n      course of his lectures to reconsider the same subject the year thereafter,\r\n      he is very likely to correct it. As to be a teacher of science is\r\n      certainly the natural employment of a mere man of letters; so is it\r\n      likewise, perhaps, the education which is most likely to render him a man\r\n      of solid learning and knowledge. The mediocrity of church benefices\r\n      naturally tends to draw the greater part of men of letters in the country\r\n      where it takes place, to the employment in which they can be the most\r\n      useful to the public, and at the same time to give them the best\r\n      education, perhaps, they are capable of receiving. It tends to render\r\n      their learning both as solid as possible, and as useful as possible.\r\n\r\n      The revenue of every established church, such parts of it excepted as may\r\n      arise from particular lands or manors, is a branch, it ought to be\r\n      observed, of the general revenue of the state, which is thus diverted to a\r\n      purpose very different from the defence of the state. The tithe, for\r\n      example, is a real land tax, which puts it out of the power of the\r\n      proprietors of land to contribute so largely towards the defence of the\r\n      state as they otherwise might be able to do. The rent of land, however,\r\n      is, according to some, the sole fund; and, according to others, the\r\n      principal fund, from which, in all great monarchies, the exigencies of the\r\n      state must be ultimately supplied. The more of this fund that is given to\r\n      the church, the less, it is evident, can be spared to the state. It may be\r\n      laid down as a certain maxim, that all other things being supposed equal,\r\n      the richer the church, the poorer must necessarily be, either the\r\n      sovereign on the one hand, or the people on the other; and, in all cases,\r\n      the less able must the state be to defend itself. In several protestant\r\n      countries, particularly in all the protestant cantons of Switzerland, the\r\n      revenue which anciently belonged to the Roman catholic church, the tithes\r\n      and church lands, has been found a fund sufficient, not only to afford\r\n      competent salaries to the established clergy, but to defray, with little\r\n      or no addition, all the other expenses of the state. The magistrates of\r\n      the powerful canton of Berne, in particular, have accumulated, out of the\r\n      savings from this fund, a very large sum, supposed to amount to several\r\n      millions; part of which is deposited in a public treasure, and part is\r\n      placed at interest in what are called the public funds of the different\r\n      indebted nations of Europe; chiefly in those of France and Great Britain.\r\n      What may be the amount of the whole expense which the church, either of\r\n      Berne, or of any other protestant canton, costs the state, I do not\r\n      pretend to know. By a very exact account it appears, that, in 1755, the\r\n      whole revenue of the clergy of the church of Scotland, including their\r\n      glebe or church lands, and the rent of their manses or dwelling-houses,\r\n      estimated according to a reasonable valuation, amounted only to\r\n      £68,514:1:5 ¹⁄₁₂d. This very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence\r\n      to nine hundred and forty-four ministers. The whole expense of the church,\r\n      including what is occasionally laid out for the building and reparation of\r\n      churches, and of the manses of ministers, cannot well be supposed to\r\n      exceed eighty or eighty-five thousand pounds a-year. The most opulent\r\n      church in Christendom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith,\r\n      the fervour of devotion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere\r\n      morals, in the great body of the people, than this very poorly endowed\r\n      church of Scotland. All the good effects, both civil and religious, which\r\n      an established church can be supposed to produce, are produced by it as\r\n      completely as by any other. The greater part of the protestant churches of\r\n      Switzerland, which, in general, are not better endowed than the church of\r\n      Scotland, produce those effects in a still higher degree. In the greater\r\n      part of the protestant cantons, there is not a single person to be found,\r\n      who does not profess himself to be of the established church. If he\r\n      professes himself to be of any other, indeed, the law obliges him to leave\r\n      the canton. But so severe, or, rather, indeed, so oppressive a law, could\r\n      never have been executed in such free countries, had not the diligence of\r\n      the clergy beforehand converted to the established church the whole body\r\n      of the people, with the exception of, perhaps, a few individuals only. In\r\n      some parts of Switzerland, accordingly, where, from the accidental union\r\n      of a protestant and Roman catholic country, the conversion has not been so\r\n      complete, both religions are not only tolerated, but established by law.\r\n\r\n      The proper performance of every service seems to require, that its pay or\r\n      recompence should be, as exactly as possible, proportioned to the nature\r\n      of the service. If any service is very much underpaid, it is very apt to\r\n      suffer by the meanness and incapacity of the greater part of those who are\r\n      employed in it. If it is very much overpaid, it is apt to suffer, perhaps\r\n      still more, by their negligence and idleness. A man of a large revenue,\r\n      whatever may be his profession, thinks he ought to live like other men of\r\n      large revenues; and to spend a great part of his time in festivity, in\r\n      vanity, and in dissipation. But in a clergyman, this train of life not\r\n      only consumes the time which ought to be employed in the duties of his\r\n      function, but in the eyes of the common people, destroys almost entirely\r\n      that sanctity of character, which can alone enable him to perform those\r\n      duties with proper weight and authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART IV. Of the Expense of supporting the Dignity of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\n      Over and above the expenses necessary for enabling the sovereign to\r\n      perform his several duties, a certain expense is requisite for the support\r\n      of his dignity. This expense varies, both with the different periods of\r\n      improvement, and with the different forms of government.\r\n\r\n      In an opulent and improved society, where all the different orders of\r\n      people are growing every day more expensive in their houses, in their\r\n      furniture, in their tables, in their dress, and in their equipage; it\r\n      cannot well be expected that the sovereign should alone hold out against\r\n      the fashion. He naturally, therefore, or rather necessarily, becomes more\r\n      expensive in all those different articles too. His dignity even seems to\r\n      require that he should become so.\r\n\r\n      As, in point of dignity, a monarch is more raised above his subjects than\r\n      the chief magistrate of any republic is ever supposed to be above his\r\n      fellow-citizens; so a greater expense is necessary for supporting that\r\n      higher dignity. We naturally expect more splendour in the court of a king,\r\n      than in the mansion-house of a doge or burgo-master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n      The expense of defending the society, and that of supporting the dignity\r\n      of the chief magistrate, are both laid out for the general benefit of the\r\n      whole society. It is reasonable, therefore, that they should be defrayed\r\n      by the general contribution of the whole society; all the different\r\n      members contributing, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their\r\n      respective abilities.\r\n\r\n      The expense of the administration of justice, too, may no doubt be\r\n      considered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society. There is no\r\n      impropriety, therefore, in its being defrayed by the general contribution\r\n      of the whole society. The persons, however, who give occasion to this\r\n      expense, are those who, by their injustice in one way or another, make it\r\n      necessary to seek redress or protection from the courts of justice. The\r\n      persons, again, most immediately benefited by this expense, are those whom\r\n      the courts of justice either restore to their rights, or maintain in their\r\n      rights. The expense of the administration of justice, therefore, may very\r\n      properly be defrayed by the particular contribution of one or other, or\r\n      both, of those two different sets of persons, according as different\r\n      occasions may require, that is, by the fees of court. It cannot be\r\n      necessary to have recourse to the general contribution of the whole\r\n      society, except for the conviction of those criminals who have not\r\n      themselves any estate or fund sufficient for paying those fees.\r\n\r\n      Those local or provincial expenses, of which the benefit is local or\r\n      provincial (what is laid out, for example, upon the police of a particular\r\n      town or district), ought to be defrayed by a local or provincial revenue,\r\n      and ought to be no burden upon the general revenue of the society. It is\r\n      unjust that the whole society should contribute towards an expense, of\r\n      which the benefit is confined to a part of the society.\r\n\r\n      The expense of maintaining good roads and communications is, no doubt,\r\n      beneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore, without any\r\n      injustice, be defrayed by the general contributions of the whole society.\r\n      This expense, however, is most immediately and directly beneficial to\r\n      those who travel or carry goods from one place to another, and to those\r\n      who consume such goods. The turnpike tolls in England, and the duties\r\n      called peages in other countries, lay it altogether upon those two\r\n      different sets of people, and thereby discharge the general revenue of the\r\n      society from a very considerable burden.\r\n\r\n      The expense of the institutions for education and religious instruction,\r\n      is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may,\r\n      therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general contribution of\r\n      the whole society. This expense, however, might, perhaps, with equal\r\n      propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those\r\n      who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction, or by\r\n      the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for\r\n      either the one or the other.\r\n\r\n      When the institutions, or public works, which are beneficial to the whole\r\n      society, either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not maintained\r\n      altogether, by the contribution of such particular members of the society\r\n      as are most immediately benefited by them; the deficiency must, in most\r\n      cases, be made up by the general contribution of the whole society. The\r\n      general revenue of the society, over and above defraying the expense of\r\n      defending the society, and of supporting the dignity of the chief\r\n      magistrate, must make up for the deficiency of many particular branches of\r\n      revenue. The sources of this general or public revenue, I shall endeavour\r\n      to explain in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nOF THE SOURCES OF THE GENERAL OR PUBLIC\r\nREVENUE OF THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The revenue which must defray, not only the expense of defending the\r\n      society and of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate, but all the\r\n      other necessary expenses of government, for which the constitution of the\r\n      state has not provided any particular revenue may be drawn, either, first,\r\n      from some fund which peculiarly belongs to the sovereign or commonwealth,\r\n      and which is independent of the revenue of the people; or, secondly, from\r\n      the revenue of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART I. Of the Funds, or Sources, of Revenue, which may peculiarly belong\r\n      to the Sovereign or Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n      The funds, or sources, of revenue, which may peculiarly belong to the\r\n      sovereign or commonwealth, must consist, either in stock, or in land.\r\n\r\n      The sovereign, like, any other owner of stock, may derive a revenue from\r\n      it, either by employing it himself, or by lending it. His revenue is, in\r\n      the one case, profit, in the other interest.\r\n\r\n      The revenue of a Tartar or Arabian chief consists in profit. It arises\r\n      principally from the milk and increase of his own herds and flocks, of\r\n      which he himself superintends the management, and is the principal\r\n      shepherd or herdsman of his own horde or tribe. It is, however, in this\r\n      earliest and rudest state of civil government only, that profit has ever\r\n      made the principal part of the public revenue of a monarchical state.\r\n\r\n      Small republics have sometimes derived a considerable revenue from the\r\n      profit of mercantile projects. The republic of Hamburgh is said to do so\r\n      from the profits of a public wine-cellar and apothecary’s shop. {See\r\n      Memoires concernant les Droits et Impositions en Europe, tome i. page 73.\r\n      This work was compiled by the order of the court, for the use of a\r\n      commission employed for some years past in considering the proper means\r\n      for reforming the finances of France. The account of the French taxes,\r\n      which takes up three volumes in quarto, may be regarded as perfectly\r\n      authentic. That of those of other European nations was compiled from such\r\n      information as the French ministers at the different courts could procure.\r\n      It is much shorter, and probably not quite so exact as that of the French\r\n      taxes.} That state cannot be very great, of which the sovereign has\r\n      leisure to carry on the trade of a wine-merchant or an apothecary. The\r\n      profit of a public bank has been a source of revenue to more considerable\r\n      states. It has been so, not only to Hamburgh, but to Venice and Amsterdam.\r\n      A revenue of this kind has even by some people been thought not below the\r\n      attention of so great an empire as that of Great Britain. Reckoning the\r\n      ordinary dividend of the bank of England at five and a-half per cent., and\r\n      its capital at ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds, the\r\n      neat annual profit, after paying the expense of management, must amount,\r\n      it is said, to five hundred and ninety-two thousand nine hundred pounds.\r\n      Government, it is pretended, could borrow this capital at three per cent.\r\n      interest, and, by taking the management of the bank into its own hands,\r\n      might make a clear profit of two hundred and sixty-nine thousand five\r\n      hundred pounds a-year. The orderly, vigilant, and parsimonious\r\n      administration of such aristocracies as those of Venice and Amsterdam, is\r\n      extremely proper, it appears from experience, for the management of a\r\n      mercantile project of this kind. But whether such a government as that of\r\n      England, which, whatever may be its virtues, has never been famous for\r\n      good economy; which, in time of peace, has generally conducted itself with\r\n      the slothful and negligent profusion that is, perhaps, natural to\r\n      monarchies; and, in time of war, has constantly acted with all the\r\n      thoughtless extravagance that democracies are apt to fall into, could be\r\n      safely trusted with the management of such a project, must at least be a\r\n      good deal more doubtful.\r\n\r\n      The post-office is properly a mercantile project. The government advances\r\n      the expense of establishing the different offices, and of buying or hiring\r\n      the necessary horses or carriages, and is repaid, with a large profit, by\r\n      the duties upon what is carried. It is, perhaps, the only mercantile\r\n      project which has been successfully managed by, I believe, every sort of\r\n      government. The capital to be advanced is not very considerable. There is\r\n      no mystery in the business. The returns are not only certain but\r\n      immediate.\r\n\r\n      Princes, however, have frequently engaged in many other mercantile\r\n      projects, and have been willing, like private persons, to mend their\r\n      fortunes, by becoming adventurers in the common branches of trade. They\r\n      have scarce ever succeeded. The profusion with which the affairs of\r\n      princes are always managed, renders it almost impossible that they should.\r\n      The agents of a prince regard the wealth of their master as inexhaustible;\r\n      are careless at what price they buy, are careless at what price they sell,\r\n      are careless at what expense they transport his goods from one place to\r\n      another. Those agents frequently live with the profusion of princes; and\r\n      sometimes, too, in spite of that profusion, and by a proper method of\r\n      making up their accounts, acquire the fortunes of princes. It was thus, as\r\n      we are told by Machiavel, that the agents of Lorenzo of Medicis, not a\r\n      prince of mean abilities, carried on his trade. The republic of Florence\r\n      was several times obliged to pay the debt into which their extravagance\r\n      had involved him. He found it convenient, accordingly to give up the\r\n      business of merchant, the business to which his family had originally owed\r\n      their fortune, and, in the latter part of his life, to employ both what\r\n      remained of that fortune, and the revenue of the state, of which he had\r\n      the disposal, in projects and expenses more suitable to his station.\r\n\r\n      No two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader and\r\n      sovereign. If the trading spirit of the English East India company renders\r\n      them very bad sovereigns, the spirit of sovereignty seems to have rendered\r\n      them equally bad traders. While they were traders only, they managed their\r\n      trade successfully, and were able to pay from their profits a moderate\r\n      dividend to the proprietors of their stock. Since they became sovereigns,\r\n      with a revenue which, it is said, was originally more than three millions\r\n      sterling, they have been obliged to beg the ordinary assistance of\r\n      government, in order to avoid immediate bankruptcy. In their former\r\n      situation, their servants in India considered themselves as the clerks of\r\n      merchants; in their present situation, those servants consider themselves\r\n      as the ministers of sovereigns.\r\n\r\n      A state may sometimes derive some part of its public revenue from the\r\n      interest of money, as well as from the profits of stock. If it has amassed\r\n      a treasure, it may lend a part of that treasure, either to foreign states,\r\n      or to its own subjects.\r\n\r\n      The canton of Berne derives a considerable revenue by lending a part of\r\n      its treasure to foreign states, that is, by placing it in the public funds\r\n      of the different indebted nations of Europe, chiefly in those of France\r\n      and England. The security of this revenue must depend, first, upon the\r\n      security of the funds in which it is placed, or upon the good faith of the\r\n      government which has the management of them; and, secondly, upon the\r\n      certainty or probability of the continuance of peace with the debtor\r\n      nation. In the case of a war, the very first act of hostility on the part\r\n      of the debtor nation might be the forfeiture of the funds of its credit.\r\n      This policy of lending money to foreign states is, so far as I know\r\n      peculiar to the canton of Berne.\r\n\r\n      The city of Hamburgh {See Memoire concernant les Droites et Impositions en\r\n      Europe tome i p. 73.}has established a sort of public pawn-shop, which\r\n      lends money to the subjects of the state, upon pledges, at six per cent.\r\n      interest. This pawn-shop, or lombard, as it is called, affords a revenue,\r\n      it is pretended, to the state, of a hundred and fifty thousand crowns,\r\n      which, at four and sixpence the crown, amounts to £33,750 sterling.\r\n\r\n      The government of Pennsylvania, without amassing any treasure, invented a\r\n      method of lending, not money, indeed, but what is equivalent to money, to\r\n      its subjects. By advancing to private people, at interest, and upon land\r\n      security to double the value, paper bills of credit, to be redeemed\r\n      fifteen years after their date; and, in the mean time, made transferable\r\n      from hand to hand, like banknotes, and declared by act of assembly to be a\r\n      legal tender in all payments from one inhabitant of the province to\r\n      another, it raised a moderate revenue, which went a considerable way\r\n      towards defraying an annual expense of about £4,500, the whole ordinary\r\n      expense of that frugal and orderly government. The success of an expedient\r\n      of this kind must have depended upon three different circumstances: first,\r\n      upon the demand for some other instrument of commerce, besides gold and\r\n      silver money, or upon the demand for such a quantity of consumable stock\r\n      as could not be had without sending abroad the greater part of their gold\r\n      and silver money, in order to purchase it; secondly, upon the good credit\r\n      of the government which made use of this expedient; and, thirdly, upon the\r\n      moderation with which it was used, the whole value of the paper bills of\r\n      credit never exceeding that of the gold and silver money which would have\r\n      been necessary for carrying on their circulation, had there been no paper\r\n      bills of credit. The same expedient was, upon different occasions, adopted\r\n      by several other American colonies; but, from want of this moderation, it\r\n      produced, in the greater part of them, much more disorder than\r\n      conveniency.\r\n\r\n      The unstable and perishable nature of stock and credit, however, renders\r\n      them unfit to be trusted to as the principal funds of that sure, steady,\r\n      and permanent revenue, which can alone give security and dignity to\r\n      government. The government of no great nation, that was advanced beyond\r\n      the shepherd state, seems ever to have derived the greater part of its\r\n      public revenue from such sources.\r\n\r\n      Land is a fund of more stable and permanent nature; and the rent of public\r\n      lands, accordingly, has been the principal source of the public revenue of\r\n      many a great nation that was much advanced beyond the shepherd state. From\r\n      the produce or rent of the public lands, the ancient republics of Greece\r\n      and Italy derived for a long time the greater part of that revenue which\r\n      defrayed the necessary expenses of the commonwealth. The rent of the crown\r\n      lands constituted for a long time the greater part of the revenue of the\r\n      ancient sovereigns of Europe.\r\n\r\n      War, and the preparation for war, are the two circumstances which, in\r\n      modern times, occasion the greater part of the necessary expense or all\r\n      great states. But in the ancient republics of Greece and Italy, every\r\n      citizen was a soldier, and both served, and prepared himself for service,\r\n      at his own expense. Neither of those two circumstances, therefore, could\r\n      occasion any very considerable expense to the state. The rent of a very\r\n      moderate landed estate might be fully sufficient for defraying all the\r\n      other necessary expenses of government.\r\n\r\n      In the ancient monarchies of Europe, the manners and customs of the time\r\n      sufficiently prepared the great body of the people for war; and when they\r\n      took the field, they were, by the condition of their feudal tenures, to be\r\n      maintained either at their own expense, or at that of their immediate\r\n      lords, without bringing any new charge upon the sovereign. The other\r\n      expenses of government were, the greater part of them, very moderate. The\r\n      administration of justice, it has been shewn, instead of being a cause of\r\n      expense was a source of revenue. The labour of the country people, for\r\n      three days before, and for three days after, harvest, was thought a fund\r\n      sufficient for making and maintaining all the bridges, highways, and other\r\n      public works, which the commerce of the country was supposed to require.\r\n      In those days the principal expense of the sovereign seems to have\r\n      consisted in the maintenance of his own family and household. The officers\r\n      of his household, accordingly, were then the great officers of state. The\r\n      lord treasurer received his rents. The lord steward and lord chamberlain\r\n      looked after the expense of his family. The care of his stables was\r\n      committed to the lord constable and the lord marshal. His houses were all\r\n      built in the form of castles, and seem to have been the principal\r\n      fortresses which he possessed. The keepers of those houses or castles\r\n      might be considered as a sort of military governors. They seem to have\r\n      been the only military officers whom it was necessary to maintain in time\r\n      of peace. In these circumstances, the rent of a great landed estate might,\r\n      upon ordinary occasions, very well defray all the necessary expenses of\r\n      government.\r\n\r\n      In the present state of the greater part of the civilized monarchies of\r\n      Europe, the rent of all the lands in the country, managed as they probably\r\n      would be, if they all belonged to one proprietor, would scarce, perhaps,\r\n      amount to the ordinary revenue which they levy upon the people even in\r\n      peaceable times. The ordinary revenue of Great Britain, for example,\r\n      including not only what is necessary for defraying the current expense of\r\n      the year, but for paying the interest of the public debts, and for sinking\r\n      a part of the capital of those debts, amounts to upwards of ten millions\r\n      a-year. But the land tax, at four shillings in the pound, falls short of\r\n      two millions a-year. This land tax, as it is called however, is supposed\r\n      to be one-fifth, not only of the rent of all the land, but of that of all\r\n      the houses, and of the interest of all the capital stock of Great Britain,\r\n      that part of it only excepted which is either lent to the public, or\r\n      employed as farming stock in the cultivation of land. A very considerable\r\n      part of the produce of this tax arises from the rent of houses and the\r\n      interest of capital stock. The land tax of the city of London, for\r\n      example, at four shillings in the pound, amounts to £123,399: 6: 7; that\r\n      of the city of Westminster to £63,092: 1: 5; that of the palaces of\r\n      Whitehall and St. James’s, to £30,754: 6: 3. A certain proportion of the\r\n      land tax is, in the same manner, assessed upon all the other cities and\r\n      towns corporate in the kingdom; and arises almost altogether, either from\r\n      the rent of houses, or from what is supposed to be the interest of trading\r\n      and capital stock. According to the estimation, therefore, by which Great\r\n      Britain is rated to the land tax, the whole mass of revenue arising from\r\n      the rent of all the lands, from that of all the houses, and from the\r\n      interest of all the capital stock, that part of it only excepted which is\r\n      either lent to the public, or employed in the cultivation of land, does\r\n      not exceed ten millions sterling a-year, the ordinary revenue which\r\n      government levies upon the people, even in peaceable times. The estimation\r\n      by which Great Britain is rated to the land tax is, no doubt, taking the\r\n      whole kingdom at an average, very much below the real value; though in\r\n      several particular counties and districts it is said to be nearly equal to\r\n      that value. The rent of the lands alone, exclusive of that of houses and\r\n      of the interest of stock, has by many people been estimated at twenty\r\n      millions; an estimation made in a great measure at random, and which, I\r\n      apprehend, is as likely to be above as below the truth. But if the lands\r\n      of Great Britain, in the present state of their cultivation, do not afford\r\n      a rent of more than twenty millions a-year, they could not well afford the\r\n      half, most probably not the fourth part of that rent, if they all belonged\r\n      to a single proprietor, and were put under the negligent, expensive, and\r\n      oppressive management of his factors and agents. The crown lands of Great\r\n      Britain do not at present afford the fourth part of the rent which could\r\n      probably be drawn from them if they were the property of private persons.\r\n      If the crown lands were more extensive, it is probable, they would be\r\n      still worse managed.\r\n\r\n      The revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is, in\r\n      proportion, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. The whole\r\n      annual produce of the land of every country, if we except what is reserved\r\n      for seed, is either annually consumed by the great body of the people, or\r\n      exchanged for something else that is consumed by them. Whatever keeps down\r\n      the produce of the land below what it would otherwise rise to, keeps down\r\n      the revenue of the great body of the people, still more than it does that\r\n      of the proprietors of land. The rent of land, that portion of the produce\r\n      which belongs to the proprietors, is scarce anywhere in Great Britain\r\n      supposed to be more than a third part of the whole produce. If the land\r\n      which, in one state of cultivation, affords a revenue of ten millions\r\n      sterling a-year, would in another afford a rent of twenty millions; the\r\n      rent being, in both cases, supposed a third part of the produce, the\r\n      revenue of the proprietors would be less than it otherwise might be, by\r\n      ten millions a-year only; but the revenue of the great body of the people\r\n      would be less than it otherwise might be, by thirty millions a-year,\r\n      deducting only what would be necessary for seed. The population of the\r\n      country would be less by the number of people which thirty millions\r\n      a-year, deducting always the seed, could maintain, according to the\r\n      particular mode of living, and expense which might take place in the\r\n      different ranks of men, among whom the remainder was distributed.\r\n\r\n      Though there is not at present in Europe, any civilized state of any kind\r\n      which derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of\r\n      lands which are the property of the state; yet, in all the great\r\n      monarchies of Europe, there are still many large tracts of land which\r\n      belong to the crown. They are generally forest, and sometimes forests\r\n      where, after travelling several miles, you will scarce find a single tree;\r\n      a mere waste and loss of country, in respect both of produce and\r\n      population. In every great monarchy of Europe, the sale of the crown lands\r\n      would produce a very large sum of money, which, if applied to the payment\r\n      of the public debts, would deliver from mortgage a much greater revenue\r\n      than any which those lands have ever afforded to the crown. In countries\r\n      where lands, improved and cultivated very highly, and yielding, at the\r\n      time of sale, as great a rent as can easily be got from them, commonly\r\n      sell at thirty years purchase; the unimproved, uncultivated, and\r\n      low-rented crown lands, might well be expected to sell at forty, fifty, or\r\n      sixty years purchase. The crown might immediately enjoy the revenue which\r\n      this great price would redeem from mortgage. In the course of a few years,\r\n      it would probably enjoy another revenue. When the crown lands had become\r\n      private property, they would, in the course of a few years, become well\r\n      improved and well cultivated. The increase of their produce would increase\r\n      the population of the country, by augmenting the revenue and consumption\r\n      of the people. But the revenue which the crown derives from the duties or\r\n      custom and excise, would necessarily increase with the revenue and\r\n      consumption of the people.\r\n\r\n      The revenue which, in any civilized monarchy, the crown derives from the\r\n      crown lands, though it appears to cost nothing to individuals, in reality\r\n      costs more to the society than perhaps any other equal revenue which the\r\n      crown enjoys. It would, in all cases, be for the interest of the society,\r\n      to replace this revenue to the crown by some other equal revenue, and to\r\n      divide the lands among the people, which could not well be done better,\r\n      perhaps, than by exposing them to public sale.\r\n\r\n      Lands, for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence, parks, gardens,\r\n      public walks, etc. possessions which are everywhere considered as causes\r\n      of expense, not as sources of revenue, seem to be the only lands which, in\r\n      a great and civilized monarchy, ought to belong to the crown.\r\n\r\n      Public stock and public lands, therefore, the two sources of revenue which\r\n      may peculiarly belong to the sovereign or commonwealth, being both\r\n      improper and insufficient funds for defraying the necessary expense of any\r\n      great and civilized state; it remains that this expense must, the greater\r\n      part of it, be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another; the people\r\n      contributing a part of their own private revenue, in order to make up a\r\n      public revenue to the sovereign or commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      PART II. Of Taxes.\r\n\r\n      The private revenue of individuals, it has been shown in the first book of\r\n      this Inquiry, arises, ultimately from three different sources; rent,\r\n      profit, and wages. Every tax must finally be paid from some one or other\r\n      of those three different sources of revenue, or from all of them\r\n      indifferently. I shall endeavour to give the best account I can, first, of\r\n      those taxes which, it is intended should fall upon rent; secondly, of\r\n      those which, it is intended should fall upon profit; thirdly, of those\r\n      which, it is intended should fall upon wages; and fourthly, of those\r\n      which, it is intended should fall indifferently upon all those three\r\n      different sources of private revenue. The particular consideration of each\r\n      of these four different sorts of taxes will divide the second part of the\r\n      present chapter into four articles, three of which will require several\r\n      other subdivisions. Many of these taxes, it will appear from the following\r\n      review, are not finally paid from the fund, or source of revenue, upon\r\n      which it is intended they should fall.\r\n\r\n      Before I enter upon the examination of particular taxes, it is necessary\r\n      to premise the four following maxims with regard to taxes in general.\r\n\r\n      1. The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of\r\n      the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective\r\n      abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively\r\n      enjoy under the protection of the state. The expense of government to the\r\n      individuals of a great nation, is like the expense of management to the\r\n      joint tenants of a great estate, who are all obliged to contribute in\r\n      proportion to their respective interests in the estate. In the observation\r\n      or neglect of this maxim, consists what is called the equality or\r\n      inequality of taxation. Every tax, it must be observed once for all, which\r\n      falls finally upon one only of the three sorts of revenue above mentioned,\r\n      is necessarily unequal, in so far as it does not affect the other two. In\r\n      the following examination of different taxes, I shall seldom take much\r\n      farther notice of this sort of inequality; but shall, in most cases,\r\n      confine my observations to that inequality which is occasioned by a\r\n      particular tax falling unequally upon that particular sort of private\r\n      revenue which is affected by it.\r\n\r\n      2. The tax which each individual is bound to pay, ought to be certain and\r\n      not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to\r\n      be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every\r\n      other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject to the tax is\r\n      put more or less in the power of the tax-gatherer, who can either\r\n      aggravate the tax upon any obnoxious contributor, or extort, by the terror\r\n      of such aggravation, some present or perquisite to himself. The\r\n      uncertainty of taxation encourages the insolence, and favours the\r\n      corruption, of an order of men who are naturally unpopular, even where\r\n      they are neither insolent nor corrupt. The certainty of what each\r\n      individual ought to pay is, in taxation, a matter of so great importance,\r\n      that a very considerable degree of inequality, it appears, I believe, from\r\n      the experience of all nations, is not near so great an evil as a very\r\n      small degree of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n      3. Every tax ought to be levied at the time, or in the manner, in which it\r\n      is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it. A tax upon\r\n      the rent of land or of houses, payable at the same term at which such\r\n      rents are usually paid, is levied at the time when it is most likely to be\r\n      convenient for the contributor to pay; or when he is most likely to have\r\n      wherewithall to pay. Taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of\r\n      luxury, are all finally paid by the consumer, and generally in a manner\r\n      that is very convenient for him. He pays them by little and little, as he\r\n      has occasion to buy the goods. As he is at liberty too, either to buy or\r\n      not to buy, as he pleases, it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any\r\n      considerable inconveniency from such taxes.\r\n\r\n      4. Every tax ought to be so contrived, as both to take out and to keep out\r\n      of the pockets of the people as little as possible, over and above what it\r\n      brings into the public treasury of the state. A tax may either take out or\r\n      keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings\r\n      into the public treasury, in the four following ways. First, the levying\r\n      of it may require a great number of officers, whose salaries may eat up\r\n      the greater part of the produce of the tax, and whose perquisites may\r\n      impose another additional tax upon the people. Secondly, it may obstruct\r\n      the industry of the people, and discourage them from applying to certain\r\n      branches of business which might give maintenance and employment to great\r\n      multitudes. While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish, or\r\n      perhaps destroy, some of the funds which might enable them more easily to\r\n      do so. Thirdly, by the forfeitures and other penalties which those\r\n      unfortunate individuals incur, who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the\r\n      tax, it may frequently ruin them, and thereby put an end to the benefit\r\n      which the community might have received from the employment of their\r\n      capitals. An injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling. But\r\n      the penalties of smuggling must arise in proportion to the temptation. The\r\n      law, contrary to all the ordinary principles of justice, first creates the\r\n      temptation, and then punishes those who yield to it; and it commonly\r\n      enhances the punishment, too, in proportion to the very circumstance which\r\n      ought certainly to alleviate it, the temptation to commit the crime. {See\r\n      Sketches of the History of Man page 474, and Seq.} Fourthly, by subjecting\r\n      the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the\r\n      tax-gatherers, it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble, vexation,\r\n      and oppression; and though vexation is not, strictly speaking, expense, it\r\n      is certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing\r\n      to redeem himself from it. It is in some one or other of these four\r\n      different ways, that taxes are frequently so much more burdensome to the\r\n      people than they are beneficial to the sovereign.\r\n\r\n      The evident justice and utility of the foregoing maxims have recommended\r\n      them, more or less, to the attention of all nations. All nations have\r\n      endeavoured, to the best of their judgment, to render their taxes as equal\r\n      as they could contrive; as certain, as convenient to the contributor, both\r\n      the time and the mode of payment, and in proportion to the revenue which\r\n      they brought to the prince, as little burdensome to the people. The\r\n      following short review of some of the principal taxes which have taken\r\n      place in different ages and countries, will show, that the endeavours of\r\n      all nations have not in this respect been equally successful.\r\n\r\n      ARTICLE I.—Taxes upon Rent—Taxes upon the Rent of Land.\r\n\r\n      A tax upon the rent of land may either be imposed according to a certain\r\n      canon, every district being valued at a curtain rent, which valuation is\r\n      not afterwards to be altered; or it may be imposed in such a manner, as to\r\n      vary with every variation in the real rent of the land, and to rise or\r\n      fall with the improvement or declension of its cultivation.\r\n\r\n      A land tax which, like that of Great Britain, is assessed upon each\r\n      district according to a certain invariable canon, though it should be\r\n      equal at the time of its first establishment, necessarily becomes unequal\r\n      in process of time, according to the unequal degrees of improvement or\r\n      neglect in the cultivation of the different parts of the country. In\r\n      England, the valuation, according to which the different counties and\r\n      parishes were assessed to the land tax by the 4th of William and Mary, was\r\n      very unequal even at its first establishment. This tax, therefore, so far\r\n      offends against the first of the four maxims above mentioned. It is\r\n      perfectly agreeable to the other three. It is perfectly certain. The time\r\n      of payment for the tax, being the same as that for the rent, is as\r\n      convenient as it can be to the contributor. Though the landlord is, in all\r\n      cases, the real contributor, the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant,\r\n      to whom the landlord is obliged to allow it in the payment of the rent.\r\n      This tax is levied by a much smaller number of officers than any other\r\n      which affords nearly the same revenue. As the tax upon each district does\r\n      not rise with the rise of the rent, the sovereign does not share in the\r\n      profits of the landlord’s improvements. Those improvements sometimes\r\n      contribute, indeed, to the discharge of the other landlords of the\r\n      district. But the aggravation of the tax, which this may sometimes\r\n      occasion upon a particular estate, is always so very small, that it never\r\n      can discourage those improvements, nor keep down the produce of the land\r\n      below what it would otherwise rise to. As it has no tendency to diminish\r\n      the quantity, it can have none to raise the price of that produce. It does\r\n      not obstruct the industry of the people; it subjects the landlord to no\r\n      other inconveniency besides the unavoidable one of paying the tax. The\r\n      advantage, however, which the land-lord has derived from the invariable\r\n      constancy of the valuation, by which all the lands of Great Britain are\r\n      rated to the land-tax, has been principally owing to some circumstances\r\n      altogether extraneous to the nature of the tax.\r\n\r\n      It has been owing in part, to the great prosperity of almost every part of\r\n      the country, the rents of almost all the estates of Great Britain having,\r\n      since the time when this valuation was first established, been continually\r\n      rising, and scarce any of them having fallen. The landlords, therefore,\r\n      have almost all gained the difference between the tax which they would\r\n      have paid, according to the present rent of their estates, and that which\r\n      they actually pay according to the ancient valuation. Had the state of the\r\n      country been different, had rents been gradually falling in consequence of\r\n      the declension of cultivation, the landlords would almost all have lost\r\n      this difference. In the state of things which has happened to take place\r\n      since the revolution, the constancy of the valuation has been advantageous\r\n      to the landlord and hurtful to the sovereign. In a different state of\r\n      things it might have been advantageous to the sovereign and hurtful to the\r\n      landlord.\r\n\r\n      As the tax is made payable in money, so the valuation of the land is\r\n      expressed in money. Since the establishment of this valuation, the value\r\n      of silver has been pretty uniform, and there has been no alteration in the\r\n      standard of the coin, either as to weight or fineness. Had silver risen\r\n      considerably in its value, as it seems to have done in the course of the\r\n      two centuries which preceded the discovery of the mines of America, the\r\n      constancy of the valuation might have proved very oppressive to the\r\n      landlord. Had silver fallen considerably in its value, as it certainly did\r\n      for about a century at least after the discovery of those mines, the same\r\n      constancy of valuation would have reduced very much this branch of the\r\n      revenue of the sovereign. Had any considerable alteration been made in the\r\n      standard of the money, either by sinking the same quantity of silver to a\r\n      lower denomination, or by raising it to a higher; had an ounce of silver,\r\n      for example, instead of being coined into five shillings and two pence,\r\n      been coined either into pieces which bore so low a denomination as two\r\n      shillings and seven pence, or into pieces which bore so high a one as ten\r\n      shillings and four pence, it would, in the one case, have hurt the revenue\r\n      of the proprietor, in the other that of the sovereign.\r\n\r\n      In circumstances, therefore, somewhat different from those which have\r\n      actually taken place, this constancy of valuation might have been a very\r\n      great inconveniency, either to the contributors or to the commonwealth. In\r\n      the course of ages, such circumstances, however, must at some time or\r\n      other happen. But though empires, like all the other works of men, have\r\n      all hitherto proved mortal, yet every empire aims at immortality. Every\r\n      constitution, therefore, which it is meant should be as permanent as the\r\n      empire itself, ought to be convenient, not in certain circumstances only,\r\n      but in all circumstances; or ought to be suited, not to those\r\n      circumstances which are transitory, occasional, or accidental, but to\r\n      those which are necessary, and therefore always the same.\r\n\r\n      A tax upon the rent of land, which varies with every variation of the\r\n      rent, or which rises and falls according to the improvement or neglect of\r\n      cultivation, is recommended by that sect of men of letters in France, who\r\n      call themselves the economists, as the most equitable of all taxes. All\r\n      taxes, they pretend, fall ultimately upon the rent of land, and ought,\r\n      therefore, to be imposed equally upon the fund which must finally pay\r\n      them. That all taxes ought to fall as equally as possible upon the fund\r\n      which must finally pay them, is certainly true. But without entering into\r\n      the disagreeable discussion of the metaphysical arguments by which they\r\n      support their very ingenious theory, it will sufficiently appear, from the\r\n      following review, what are the taxes which fall finally upon the rent of\r\n      the land, and what are those which fall finally upon some other fund.\r\n\r\n      In the Venetian territory, all the arable lands which are given in lease\r\n      to farmers are taxed at a tenth of the rent. {Memoires concernant les\r\n      Droits, p. 240, 241.} The leases are recorded in a public register, which\r\n      is kept by the officers of revenue in each province or district. When the\r\n      proprietor cultivates his own lands, they are valued according to an\r\n      equitable estimation, and he is allowed a deduction of one-fifth of the\r\n      tax; so that for such land he pays only eight instead of ten per cent. of\r\n      the supposed rent.\r\n\r\n      A land-tax of this kind is certainly more equal than the land-tax of\r\n      England. It might not, perhaps, be altogether so certain, and the\r\n      assessment of the tax might frequently occasion a good deal more trouble\r\n      to the landlord. It might, too, be a good deal more expensive in the\r\n      levying.\r\n\r\n      Such a system of administration, however, might, perhaps, be contrived, as\r\n      would in a great measure both prevent this uncertainty, and moderate this\r\n      expense.\r\n\r\n      The landlord and tenant, for example, might jointly be obliged to record\r\n      their lease in a public register. Proper penalties might be enacted\r\n      against concealing or misrepresenting any of the conditions; and if part\r\n      of those penalties were to be paid to either of the two parties who\r\n      informed against and convicted the other of such concealment or\r\n      misrepresentation, it would effectually deter them from combining together\r\n      in order to defraud the public revenue. All the conditions of the lease\r\n      might be sufficiently known from such a record.\r\n\r\n      Some landlords, instead of raising the rent, take a fine for the renewal\r\n      of the lease. This practice is, in most cases, the expedient of a\r\n      spendthrift, who, for a sum of ready money sells a future revenue of much\r\n      greater value. It is, in most cases, therefore, hurtful to the landlord;\r\n      it is frequently hurtful to the tenant; and it is always hurtful to the\r\n      community. It frequently takes from the tenant so great a part of his\r\n      capital, and thereby diminishes so much his ability to cultivate the land,\r\n      that he finds it more difficult to pay a small rent than it would\r\n      otherwise have been to pay a great one. Whatever diminishes his ability to\r\n      cultivate, necessarily keeps down, below what it would otherwise have\r\n      been, the most important part of the revenue of the community. By\r\n      rendering the tax upon such fines a good deal heavier than upon the\r\n      ordinary rent, this hurtful practice might be discouraged, to the no small\r\n      advantage of all the different parties concerned, of the landlord, of the\r\n      tenant, of the sovereign, and of the whole community.\r\n\r\n      Some leases prescribe to the tenant a certain mode of cultivation, and a\r\n      certain succession of crops, during the whole continuance of the lease.\r\n      This condition, which is generally the effect of the landlord’s conceit of\r\n      his own superior knowledge (a conceit in most cases very ill-founded),\r\n      ought always to be considered as an additional rent, as a rent in service,\r\n      instead of a rent in money. In order to discourage the practice, which is\r\n      generally a foolish one, this species of rent might be valued rather high,\r\n      and consequently taxed somewhat higher than common money-rents.\r\n\r\n      Some landlords, instead of a rent in money, require a rent in kind, in\r\n      corn, cattle, poultry, wine, oil, etc.; others, again, require a rent in\r\n      service. Such rents are always more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial\r\n      to the landlord. They either take more, or keep more out of the pocket of\r\n      the former, than they put into that of the latter. In every country where\r\n      they take place, the tenants are poor and beggarly, pretty much according\r\n      to the degree in which they take place. By valuing, in the same manner,\r\n      such rents rather high, and consequently taxing them somewhat higher than\r\n      common money-rents, a practice which is hurtful to the whole community,\r\n      might, perhaps, be sufficiently discouraged.\r\n\r\n      When the landlord chose to occupy himself a part of his own lands, the\r\n      rent might be valued according to an equitable arbitration of the farmers\r\n      and landlords in the neighbourhood, and a moderate abatement of the tax\r\n      might be granted to him, in the same manner as in the Venetian territory,\r\n      provided the rent of the lands which he occupied did not exceed a certain\r\n      sum. It is of importance that the landlord should be encouraged to\r\n      cultivate a part of his own land. His capital is generally greater than\r\n      that of the tenant, and, with less skill, he can frequently raise a\r\n      greater produce. The landlord can afford to try experiments, and is\r\n      generally disposed to do so. His unsuccessful experiments occasion only a\r\n      moderate loss to himself. His successful ones contribute to the\r\n      improvement and better cultivation of the whole country. It might be of\r\n      importance, however, that the abatement of the tax should encourage him to\r\n      cultivate to a certain extent only. If the landlords should, the greater\r\n      part of them, be tempted to farm the whole of their own lands, the country\r\n      (instead of sober and industrious tenants, who are bound by their own\r\n      interest to cultivate as well as their capital and skill will allow them)\r\n      would be filled with idle and profligate bailiffs, whose abusive\r\n      management would soon degrade the cultivation, and reduce the annual\r\n      produce of the land, to the diminution, not only of the revenue of their\r\n      masters, but of the most important part of that of the whole society.\r\n\r\n      Such a system of administration might, perhaps, free a tax of this kind\r\n      from any degree of uncertainty, which could occasion either oppression or\r\n      inconveniency to the contributor; and might, at the same time, serve to\r\n      introduce into the common management of land such a plan of policy as\r\n      might contribute a good deal to the general improvement and good\r\n      cultivation of the country.\r\n\r\n      The expense of levying a land-tax, which varied with every variation of\r\n      the rent, would, no doubt, be somewhat greater than that of levying one\r\n      which was always rated according to a fixed valuation. Some additional\r\n      expense would necessarily be incurred, both by the different\r\n      register-offices which it would be proper to establish in the different\r\n      districts of the country, and by the different valuations which might\r\n      occasionally be made of the lands which the proprietor chose to occupy\r\n      himself. The expense of all this, however, might be very moderate, and\r\n      much below what is incurred in the levying of many other taxes, which\r\n      afford a very inconsiderable revenue in comparison of what might easily be\r\n      drawn from a tax of this kind.\r\n\r\n      The discouragement which a variable land-tax of this kind might give to\r\n      the improvement of land, seems to be the most important objection which\r\n      can be made to it. The landlord would certainly be less disposed to\r\n      improve, when the sovereign, who contributed nothing to the expense, was\r\n      to share in the profit of the improvement. Even this objection might,\r\n      perhaps, be obviated, by allowing the landlord, before he began his\r\n      improvement, to ascertain, in conjunction with the officers of revenue,\r\n      the actual value of his lands, according to the equitable arbitration of a\r\n      certain number of landlords and farmers in the neighbourhood, equally\r\n      chosen by both parties: and by rating him, according to this valuation,\r\n      for such a number of years as might be fully sufficient for his complete\r\n      indemnification. To draw the attention of the sovereign towards the\r\n      improvement of the land, from a regard to the increase of his own revenue,\r\n      is one or the principal advantages proposed by this species of land-tax.\r\n      The term, therefore, allowed, for the indemnification of the landlord,\r\n      ought not to be a great deal longer than what was necessary for that\r\n      purpose, lest the remoteness of the interest should discourage too much\r\n      this attention. It had better, however, be somewhat too long, than in any\r\n      respect too short. No incitement to the attention of the sovereign can\r\n      ever counterbalance the smallest discouragement to that of the landlord.\r\n      The attention of the sovereign can be, at best, but a very general and\r\n      vague consideration of what is likely to contribute to the better\r\n      cultivation of the greater part of his dominions. The attention of the\r\n      landlord is a particular and minute consideration of what is likely to be\r\n      the most advantageous application of every inch of ground upon his estate.\r\n      The principal attention of the sovereign ought to be, to encourage, by\r\n      every means in his power, the attention both of the landlord and of the\r\n      farmer, by allowing both to pursue their own interest in their own way,\r\n      and according to their own judgment; by giving to both the most perfect\r\n      security that they shall enjoy the full recompence of their own industry;\r\n      and by procuring to both the most extensive market for every part of their\r\n      produce, in consequence of establishing the easiest and safest\r\n      communications, both by land and by water, through every part of his own\r\n      dominions, as well as the most unbounded freedom of exportation to the\r\n      dominions of all other princes.\r\n\r\n      If, by such a system of administration, a tax of this kind could be so\r\n      managed as to give, not only no discouragement, but, on the contrary, some\r\n      encouragement to the improvement or land, it does not appear likely to\r\n      occasion any other inconveniency to the landlord, except always the\r\n      unavoidable one of being obliged to pay the tax. In all the variations of\r\n      the state of the society, in the improvement and in the declension of\r\n      agriculture; in all the variations in the value of silver, and in all\r\n      those in the standard of the coin, a tax of this kind would, of its own\r\n      accord, and without any attention of government, readily suit itself to\r\n      the actual situation of things, and would be equally just and equitable in\r\n      all those different changes. It would, therefore, be much more proper to\r\n      be established as a perpetual and unalterable regulation, or as what is\r\n      called a fundamental law of the commonwealth, than any tax which was\r\n      always to be levied according to a certain valuation.\r\n\r\n      Some states, instead of the simple and obvious expedient of a register of\r\n      leases, have had recourse to the laborious and expensive one of an actual\r\n      survey and valuation of all the lands in the country. They have suspected,\r\n      probably, that the lessor and lessee, in order to defraud the public\r\n      revenue, might combine to conceal the real terms of the lease.\r\n      Doomsday-book seems to have been the result of a very accurate survey of\r\n      this kind.\r\n\r\n      In the ancient dominions of the king of Prussia, the land-tax is assessed\r\n      according to an actual survey and valuation, which is reviewed and altered\r\n      from time to time. {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom, i. p. 114,\r\n      115, 116, etc.} According to that valuation, the lay proprietors pay from\r\n      twenty to twenty-five per cent. of their revenue; ecclesiastics from forty\r\n      to forty-five per cent. The survey and valuation of Silesia was made by\r\n      order of the present king, it is said, with great accuracy. According to\r\n      that valuation, the lands belonging to the bishop of Breslaw are taxed at\r\n      twenty-five per cent. of their rent. The other revenues of the\r\n      ecclesiastics of both religions at fifty per cent. The commanderies of the\r\n      Teutonic order, and of that of Malta, at forty per cent. Lands held by a\r\n      noble tenure, at thirty-eight and one-third per cent. Lands held by a base\r\n      tenure, at thirty-five and one-third per cent.\r\n\r\n      The survey and valuation of Bohemia is said to have been the work of more\r\n      than a hundred years. It was not perfected till after the peace of 1748,\r\n      by the orders of the present empress queen. {Id. tom i. p.85, 84.} The\r\n      survey of the duchy of Milan, which was begun in the time of Charles VI.,\r\n      was not perfected till after 1760. It is esteemed one of the most\r\n      accurate that has ever been made. The survey of Savoy and Piedmont was\r\n      executed under the orders of the late king of Sardinia. {Id. p. 280,\r\n      etc.; also p, 287. etc. to 316.}\r\n\r\n      In the dominions of the king of Prussia, the revenue of the church is\r\n      taxed much higher than that of lay proprietors. The revenue of the church\r\n      is, the greater part of it, a burden upon the rent of land. It seldom\r\n      happens that any part of it is applied towards the improvement of land; or\r\n      is so employed as to contribute, in any respect, towards increasing the\r\n      revenue of the great body of the people. His Prussian majesty had\r\n      probably, upon that account, thought it reasonable that it should\r\n      contribute a good deal more towards relieving the exigencies of the state.\r\n      In some countries, the lands of the church are exempted from all taxes. In\r\n      others, they are taxed more lightly than other lands. In the duchy of\r\n      Milan, the lands which the church possessed before 1575, are rated to the\r\n      tax at a third only or their value.\r\n\r\n      In Silesia, lands held by a noble tenure are taxed three per cent. higher\r\n      than those held by a base tenure. The honours and privileges of different\r\n      kinds annexed to the former, his Prussian majesty had probably imagined,\r\n      would sufficiently compensate to the proprietor a small aggravation of the\r\n      tax; while, at the same time, the humiliating inferiority of the latter\r\n      would be in some measure alleviated, by being taxed somewhat more lightly.\r\n      In other countries, the system of taxation, instead of alleviating,\r\n      aggravates this inequality. In the dominions of the king of Sardinia, and\r\n      in those provinces of France which are subject to what is called the real\r\n      or predial taille, the tax falls altogether upon the lands held by a base\r\n      tenure. Those held by a noble one are exempted.\r\n\r\n      A land tax assessed according to a general survey and valuation, how equal\r\n      soever it may be at first, must, in the course of a very moderate period\r\n      of time, become unequal. To prevent its becoming so would require the\r\n      continual and painful attention of government to all the variations in the\r\n      state and produce of every different farm in the country. The governments\r\n      of Prussia, of Bohemia, of Sardinia, and of the duchy of Milan, actually\r\n      exert an attention of this kind; an attention so unsuitable to the nature\r\n      of government, that it is not likely to be of long continuance, and which,\r\n      if it is continued, will probably, in the long-run, occasion much more\r\n      trouble and vexation than it can possibly bring relief to the\r\n      contributors.\r\n\r\n      In 1666, the generality of Montauban was assessed to the real or predial\r\n      taille, according, it is said, to a very exact survey and valuation.\r\n      {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom. ii p. 139, etc.} By 1727, this\r\n      assessment had become altogether unequal. In order to remedy this\r\n      inconveniency, government has found no better expedient, than to impose\r\n      upon the whole generality an additional tax of a hundred and twenty\r\n      thousand livres. This additional tax is rated upon all the different\r\n      districts subject to the taille according to the old assessment. But it is\r\n      levied only upon those which, in the actual state of things, are by that\r\n      assessment under-taxed; and it is applied to the relief of those which, by\r\n      the same assessment, are over-taxed. Two districts, for example, one of\r\n      which ought, in the actual state of things, to be taxed at nine hundred,\r\n      the other at eleven hundred livres, are, by the old assessment, both taxed\r\n      at a thousand livres. Both these districts are, by the additional tax,\r\n      rated at eleven hundred livres each. But this additional tax is levied\r\n      only upon the district under-charged, and it is applied altogether to the\r\n      relief of that overcharged, which consequently pays only nine hundred\r\n      livres. The government neither gains nor loses by the additional tax,\r\n      which is applied altogether to remedy the inequalities arising from the\r\n      old assessment. The application is pretty much regulated according to the\r\n      discretion of the intendant of the generality, and must, therefore, be in\r\n      a great measure arbitrary.\r\n\r\n      Taxes which are proportioned, not in the Rent, but to the Produce of Land.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the produce of land are, in reality, taxes upon the rent; and\r\n      though they may be originally advanced by the farmer, are finally paid by\r\n      the landlord. When a certain portion of the produce is to be paid away for\r\n      a tax, the farmer computes as well as he can, what the value of this\r\n      portion is, one year with another, likely to amount to, and he makes a\r\n      proportionable abatement in the rent which he agrees to pay to the\r\n      landlord. There is no farmer who does not compute beforehand what the\r\n      church tythe, which is a land tax of this kind, is, one year with another,\r\n      likely to amount to.\r\n\r\n      The tythe, and every other land tax of this kind, under the appearance of\r\n      perfect equality, are very unequal taxes; a certain portion of the produce\r\n      being in different situations, equivalent to a very different portion of\r\n      the rent. In some very rich lands, the produce is so great, that the one\r\n      half of it is fully sufficient to replace to the farmer his capital\r\n      employed in cultivation, together with the ordinary profits of farming\r\n      stock in the neighbourhood. The other half, or, what comes to the same\r\n      thing, the value of the other half, he could afford to pay as rent to the\r\n      landlord, if there was no tythe. But if a tenth of the produce is taken\r\n      from him in the way of tythe, he must require an abatement of the fifth\r\n      part of his rent, otherwise he cannot get back his capital with the\r\n      ordinary profit. In this case, the rent of the landlord, instead of\r\n      amounting to a half, or five-tenths of the whole produce, will amount only\r\n      to four-tenths of it. In poorer lands, on the contrary, the produce is\r\n      sometimes so small, and the expense of cultivation so great, that it\r\n      requires four-fifths of the whole produce, to replace to the farmer his\r\n      capital with the ordinary profit. In this case, though there was no tythe,\r\n      the rent of the landlord could amount to no more than one-fifth or\r\n      two-tenths of the whole produce. But if the farmer pays one-tenth of the\r\n      produce in the way of tythe, he must require an equal abatement of the\r\n      rent of the landlord, which will thus be reduced to one-tenth only of the\r\n      whole produce. Upon the rent of rich lands the tythe may sometimes be a\r\n      tax of no more than one-fifth part, or four shillings in the pound;\r\n      whereas upon that of poorer lands, it may sometimes be a tax of one half,\r\n      or of ten shillings in the pound.\r\n\r\n      The tythe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, so it is\r\n      always a great discouragement, both to the improvements of the landlord,\r\n      and to the cultivation of the farmer. The one cannot venture to make the\r\n      most important, which are generally the most expensive improvements; nor\r\n      the other to raise the most valuable, which are generally, too, the most\r\n      expensive crops; when the church, which lays out no part of the expense,\r\n      is to share so very largely in the profit. The cultivation of madder was,\r\n      for a long time, confined by the tythe to the United Provinces, which,\r\n      being presbyterian countries, and upon that account exempted from this\r\n      destructive tax, enjoyed a sort of monopoly of that useful dyeing drug\r\n      against the rest of Europe. The late attempts to introduce the culture of\r\n      this plant into England, have been made only in consequence of the\r\n      statute, which enacted that five shillings an acre should be received in\r\n      lieu of all manner of tythe upon madder.\r\n\r\n      As through the greater part of Europe, the church, so in many different\r\n      countries of Asia, the state, is principally supported by a land tax,\r\n      proportioned not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. In China,\r\n      the principal revenue of the sovereign consists in a tenth part of the\r\n      produce of all the lands of the empire. This tenth part, however, is\r\n      estimated so very moderately, that, in many provinces, it is said not to\r\n      exceed a thirtieth part of the ordinary produce. The land tax or land rent\r\n      which used to be paid to the Mahometan government of Bengal, before that\r\n      country fell into the hands of the English East India company, is said to\r\n      have amounted to about a fifth part of the produce. The land tax of\r\n      ancient Egypt is said likewise to have amounted to a fifth part.\r\n\r\n      In Asia, this sort of land tax is said to interest the sovereign in the\r\n      improvement and cultivation of land. The sovereigns of China, those of\r\n      Bengal while under the Mahometan govermnent, and those of ancient Egypt,\r\n      are said, accordingly, to have been extremely attentive to the making and\r\n      maintaining of good roads and navigable canals, in order to increase, as\r\n      much as possible, both the quantity and value of every part of the produce\r\n      of the land, by procuring to every part of it the most extensive market\r\n      which their own dominions could afford. The tythe of the church is divided\r\n      into such small portions that no one of its proprietors can have any\r\n      interest of this kind. The parson of a parish could never find his\r\n      account, in making a road or canal to a distant part of the country, in\r\n      order to extend the market for the produce of his own particular parish.\r\n      Such taxes, when destined for the maintenance of the state, have some\r\n      advantages, which may serve in some measure to balance their\r\n      inconveniency. When destined for the maintenance of the church, they are\r\n      attended with nothing but inconveniency.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the produce of land may be levied, either in kind, or,\r\n      according to a certain valuation in money.\r\n\r\n      The parson of a parish, or a gentleman of small fortune who lives upon his\r\n      estate, may sometimes, perhaps find some advantage in receiving, the one\r\n      his tythe, and the other his rent, in kind. The quantity to be collected,\r\n      and the district within which it is to be collected, are so small, that\r\n      they both can oversee, with their own eyes, the collection and disposal of\r\n      every part of what is due to them. A gentleman of great fortune, who lived\r\n      in the capital, would be in danger of suffering much by the neglect, and\r\n      more by the fraud, of his factors and agents, if the rents of an estate in\r\n      a distant province were to be paid to him in this manner. The loss of the\r\n      sovereign, from the abuse and depredation of his tax-gatherers, would\r\n      necessarily be much greater. The servants of the most careless private\r\n      person are, perhaps, more under the eye of their master than those of the\r\n      most careful prince; and a public revenue, which was paid in kind, would\r\n      suffer so much from the mismanagement of the collectors, that a very small\r\n      part of what was levied upon the people would ever arrive at the treasury\r\n      of the prince. Some part of the public revenue of China, however, is said\r\n      to be paid in this manner. The mandarins and other tax-gatherers will, no\r\n      doubt, find their advantage in continuing the practice of a payment, which\r\n      is so much more liable to abuse than any payment in money.\r\n\r\n      A tax upon the produce of land, which is levied in money, may be levied,\r\n      either according to a valuation, which varies with all the variations of\r\n      the market price; or according to a fixed valuation, a bushel of wheat,\r\n      for example, being always valued at one and the same money price, whatever\r\n      may be the state of the market. The produce of a tax levied in the former\r\n      way will vary only according to the variations in the real produce of the\r\n      land, according to the improvement or neglect of cultivation. The produce\r\n      of a tax levied in the latter way will vary, not only according to the\r\n      variations in the produce of the land, but according both to those in the\r\n      value of the precious metals, and those in the quantity of those metals\r\n      which is at different times contained in coin of the same denomination.\r\n      The produce of the former will always bear the same proportion to the\r\n      value of the real produce of the land. The produce of the latter may, at\r\n      different times, bear very different proportions to that value.\r\n\r\n      When, instead either of a certain portion of the produce of land, or of\r\n      the price of a certain portion, a certain sum of money is to be paid in\r\n      full compensation for all tax or tythe; the tax becomes, in this case,\r\n      exactly of the same nature with the land tax of England. It neither rises\r\n      nor falls with the rent of the land. It neither encourages nor discourages\r\n      improvement. The tythe in the greater part of those parishes which pay\r\n      what is called a modus, in lieu of all other tythe is a tax of this kind.\r\n      During the Mahometan government of Bengal, instead of the payment in kind\r\n      of the fifth part of the produce, a modus, and, it is said, a very\r\n      moderate one, was established in the greater part of the districts or\r\n      zemindaries of the country. Some of the servants of the East India\r\n      company, under pretence of restoring the public revenue to its proper\r\n      value, have, in some provinces, exchanged this modus for a payment in\r\n      kind. Under their management, this change is likely both to discourage\r\n      cultivation, and to give new opportunities for abuse in the collection of\r\n      the public revenue, which has fallen very much below what it was said to\r\n      have been when it first fell under the management of the company. The\r\n      servants of the company may, perhaps, have profited by the change, but at\r\n      the expense, it is probable, both of their masters and of the country.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the Rent of Houses.\r\n\r\n      The rent of a house may be distinguished into two parts, of which the one\r\n      may very properly be called the building-rent; the other is commonly\r\n      called the ground-rent.\r\n\r\n      The building-rent is the interest or profit of the capital expended in\r\n      building the house. In order to put the trade of a builder upon a level\r\n      with other trades, it is necessary that this rent should be sufficient,\r\n      first, to pay him the same interest which he would have got for his\r\n      capital, if he had lent it upon good security; and, secondly, to keep the\r\n      house in constant repair, or, what comes to the same thing, to replace,\r\n      within a certain term of years, the capital which had been employed in\r\n      building it. The building-rent, or the ordinary profit of building, is,\r\n      therefore, everywhere regulated by the ordinary interest of money. Where\r\n      the market rate of interest is four per cent. the rent of a house, which,\r\n      over and above paying the ground-rent, affords six or six and a-half per\r\n      cent. upon the whole expense of building, may, perhaps, afford a\r\n      sufficient profit to the builder. Where the market rate of interest is\r\n      five per cent. it may perhaps require seven or seven and a half per cent.\r\n      If, in proportion to the interest of money, the trade of the builders\r\n      affords at any time much greater profit than this, it will soon draw so\r\n      much capital from other trades as will reduce the profit to its proper\r\n      level. If it affords at any time much less than this, other trades will\r\n      soon draw so much capital from it as will again raise that profit.\r\n\r\n      Whatever part of the whole rent of a house is over and above what is\r\n      sufficient for affording this reasonable profit, naturally goes to the\r\n      ground-rent; and, where the owner of the ground and the owner of the\r\n      building are two different persons, is, in most cases, completely paid to\r\n      the former. This surplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of the\r\n      house pays for some real or supposed advantage of the situation. In\r\n      country houses, at a distance from any great town, where there is plenty\r\n      of ground to chuse upon, the ground-rent is scarce anything, or no more\r\n      than what the ground which the house stands upon would pay, if employed in\r\n      agriculture. In country villas, in the neighbourhood of some great town,\r\n      it is sometimes a good deal higher; and the peculiar conveniency or beauty\r\n      of situation is there frequently very well paid for. Ground-rents are\r\n      generally highest in the capital, and in those particular parts of it\r\n      where there happens to be the greatest demand for houses, whatever be the\r\n      reason of that demand, whether for trade and business, for pleasure and\r\n      society, or for mere vanity and fashion.\r\n\r\n      A tax upon house-rent, payable by the tenant, and proportioned to the\r\n      whole rent of each house, could not, for any considerable time at least,\r\n      affect the building-rent. If the builder did not get his reasonable\r\n      profit, he would be obliged to quit the trade; which, by raising the\r\n      demand for building, would, in a short time, bring back his profit to its\r\n      proper level with that of other trades. Neither would such a tax fall\r\n      altogether upon the ground-rent; but it would divide itself in such a\r\n      manner, as to fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house, and partly\r\n      upon the owner of the ground.\r\n\r\n      Let us suppose, for example, that a particular person judges that he can\r\n      afford for house-rent all expense of sixty pounds a-year; and let us\r\n      suppose, too, that a tax of four shillings in the pound, or of one-fifth,\r\n      payable by the inhabitant, is laid upon house-rent. A house of sixty\r\n      pounds rent will, in that case, cost him seventy-two pounds a-year, which\r\n      is twelve pounds more than he thinks he can afford. He will, therefore,\r\n      content himself with a worse house, or a house of fifty pounds rent,\r\n      which, with the additional ten pounds that he must pay for the tax, will\r\n      make up the sum of sixty pounds a-year, the expense which he judges he can\r\n      afford, and, in order to pay the tax, he will give up a part of the\r\n      additional conveniency which he might have had from a house of ten pounds\r\n      a-year more rent. He will give up, I say, a part of this additional\r\n      conveniency; for he will seldom be obliged to give up the whole, but will,\r\n      in consequence of the tax, get a better house for fifty pounds a-year,\r\n      than he could have got if there had been no tax for as a tax of this kind,\r\n      by taking away this particular competitor, must diminish the competition\r\n      for houses of sixty pounds rent, so it must likewise diminish it for those\r\n      of fifty pounds rent, and in the same manner for those of all other rents,\r\n      except the lowest rent, for which it would for some time increase the\r\n      competition. But the rents of every class of houses for which the\r\n      competition was diminished, would necessarily be more or less reduced. As\r\n      no part of this reduction, however, could for any considerable time at\r\n      least, affect the building-rent, the whole of it must, in the long-run,\r\n      necessarily fall upon the ground-rent. The final payment of this tax,\r\n      therefore, would fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house, who, in\r\n      order to pay his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his\r\n      conveniency; and partly upon the owner of the ground, who, in order to pay\r\n      his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his revenue. In what\r\n      proportion this final payment would be divided between them, it is not,\r\n      perhaps, very easy to ascertain. The division would probably be very\r\n      different in different circumstances, and a tax of this kind might,\r\n      according to those different circumstances, affect very unequally, both\r\n      the inhabitant of the house and the owner of the ground.\r\n\r\n      The inequality with which a tax of this kind might fall upon the owners of\r\n      different ground-rents, would arise altogether from the accidental\r\n      inequality of this division. But the inequality with which it might fall\r\n      upon the inhabitants of different houses, would arise, not only from this,\r\n      but from another cause. The proportion of the expense of house-rent to the\r\n      whole expense of living, is different in the different degrees of fortune.\r\n      It is, perhaps, highest in the highest degree, and it diminishes gradually\r\n      through the inferior degrees, so as in general to be lowest in the lowest\r\n      degree. The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor.\r\n      They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little\r\n      revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion\r\n      the principal expense of the rich; and a magnificent house embellishes and\r\n      sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which\r\n      they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall\r\n      heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not,\r\n      perhaps, be any thing very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that\r\n      the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion\r\n      to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.\r\n\r\n      The rent of houses, though it in some respects resembles the rent of land,\r\n      is in one respect essentially different from it. The rent of land is paid\r\n      for the use of a productive subject. The land which pays it produces it.\r\n      The rent of houses is paid for the use of an unproductive subject. Neither\r\n      the house, nor the ground which it stands upon, produce anything. The\r\n      person who pays the rent, therefore, must draw it from some other source\r\n      of revenue, distinct from and independent of this subject. A tax upon the\r\n      rent of houses, so far as it falls upon the inhabitants, must be drawn\r\n      from the same source as the rent itself, and must be paid from their\r\n      revenue, whether derived from the wages of labour, the profits of stock,\r\n      or the rent of land. So far as it falls upon the inhabitants, it is one of\r\n      those taxes which fall, not upon one only, but indifferently upon all the\r\n      three different sources of revenue; and is, in every respect, of the same\r\n      nature as a tax upon any other sort of consumable commodities. In general,\r\n      there is not perhaps, any one article of expense or consumption by which\r\n      the liberality or narrowness of a man’s whole expense can be better judged\r\n      of than by his house-rent. A proportional tax upon this particular article\r\n      of expense might, perhaps, produce a more considerable revenue than any\r\n      which has hitherto been drawn from it in any part of Europe. If the tax,\r\n      indeed, was very high, the greater part of people would endeavour to evade\r\n      it as much as they could, by contenting themselves with smaller houses,\r\n      and by turning the greater part of their expense into some other channel.\r\n\r\n      The rent of houses might easily be ascertained with sufficient accuracy,\r\n      by a policy of the same kind with that which would be necessary for\r\n      ascertaining the ordinary rent of land. Houses not inhabited ought to pay\r\n      no tax. A tax upon them would fall altogether upon the proprietor, who\r\n      would thus be taxed for a subject which afforded him neither conveniency\r\n      nor revenue. Houses inhabited by the proprietor ought to be rated, not\r\n      according to the expense which they might have cost in building, but\r\n      according to the rent which an equitable arbitration might judge them\r\n      likely to bring if leased to a tenant. If rated according to the expense\r\n      which they might have cost in building, a tax of three or four shillings\r\n      in the pound, joined with other taxes, would ruin almost all the rich and\r\n      great families of this, and, I believe, of every other civilized country.\r\n      Whoever will examine with attention the different town and country houses\r\n      of some of the richest and greatest families in this country, will find\r\n      that, at the rate of only six and a-half, or seven per cent. upon the\r\n      original expense of building, their house-rent is nearly equal to the\r\n      whole neat rent of their estates. It is the accumulated expense of several\r\n      successive generations, laid out upon objects of great beauty and\r\n      magnificence, indeed, but, in proportion to what they cost, of very small\r\n      exchangeable value. {Since the first publication of this book, a tax\r\n      nearly upon the above-mentioned principles has been imposed.}\r\n\r\n      Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of\r\n      houses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rent of houses; it\r\n      would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always\r\n      as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use\r\n      of his ground. More or less can be got for it, according as the\r\n      competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their\r\n      fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense. In\r\n      every country, the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital,\r\n      and it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be\r\n      found. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased\r\n      by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay\r\n      more for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to be advanced by the\r\n      inhabitant or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance.\r\n      The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would\r\n      incline to pay for the ground; so that the final payment of the tax would\r\n      fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent. The ground-rents of\r\n      uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax. Both ground-rents, and the\r\n      ordinary rent of land, are a species of revenue which the owner, in many\r\n      cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of\r\n      this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of\r\n      the state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of\r\n      industry. The annual produce of the land and labour of the society, the\r\n      real wealth and revenue of the great body of the people, might be the same\r\n      after such a tax as before. Ground-rents, and the ordinary rent of land,\r\n      are therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best bear to have\r\n      a peculiar tax imposed upon them.\r\n\r\n      Ground-rents seem, in this respect, a more proper subject of peculiar\r\n      taxation, than even the ordinary rent of land. The ordinary rent of land\r\n      is, in many cases, owing partly, at least, to the attention and good\r\n      management of the landlord. A very heavy tax might discourage, too much,\r\n      this attention and good management. Ground-rents, so far as they exceed\r\n      the ordinary rent of land, are altogether owing to the good government of\r\n      the sovereign, which, by protecting the industry either of the whole\r\n      people or of the inhabitants of some particular place, enables them to pay\r\n      so much more than its real value for the ground which they build their\r\n      houses upon; or to make to its owner so much more than compensation for\r\n      the loss which he might sustain by this use of it. Nothing can be more\r\n      reasonable, than that a fund, which owes its existence to the good\r\n      government of the state, should be taxed peculiarly, or should contribute\r\n      something more than the greater part of other funds, towards the support\r\n      of that government.\r\n\r\n      Though, in many different countries of Europe, taxes have been imposed\r\n      upon the rent of houses, I do not know of any in which ground-rents have\r\n      been considered as a separate subject of taxation. The contrivers of taxes\r\n      have, probably, found some difficulty in ascertaining what part of the\r\n      rent ought to be considered as ground-rent, and what part ought to be\r\n      considered as building-rent. It should not, however, seem very difficult\r\n      to distinguish those two parts of the rent from one another.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain the rent of houses is supposed to be taxed in the same\r\n      proportion as the rent of land, by what is called the annual land tax. The\r\n      valuation, according to which each different parish and district is\r\n      assessed to this tax, is always the same. It was originally extremely\r\n      unequal, and it still continues to be so. Through the greater part of the\r\n      kingdom this tax falls still more lightly upon the rent of houses than\r\n      upon that of land. In some few districts only, which were originally rated\r\n      high, and in which the rents of houses have fallen considerably, the land\r\n      tax of three or four shillings in the pound is said to amount to an equal\r\n      proportion of the real rent of houses. Untenanted houses, though by law\r\n      subject to the tax, are, in most districts, exempted from it by the favour\r\n      of the assessors; and this exemption sometimes occasions some little\r\n      variation in the rate of particular houses, though that of the district is\r\n      always the same. Improvements of rent, by new buildings, repairs, etc. go\r\n      to the discharge of the district, which occasions still further variations\r\n      in the rate of particular houses.\r\n\r\n      In the province of Holland, {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. p. 223.}\r\n      every house is taxed at two and a-half per cent. of its value, without any\r\n      regard, either to the rent which it actually pays, or to the circumstance\r\n      of its being tenanted or untenanted. There seems to be a hardship in\r\n      obliging the proprietor to pay a tax for an untenanted house, from which\r\n      he can derive no revenue, especially so very heavy a tax. In Holland,\r\n      where the market rate of interest does not exceed three per cent., two and\r\n      a-half per cent. upon the whole value of the house must, in most cases,\r\n      amount to more than a third of the building-rent, perhaps of the whole\r\n      rent. The valuation, indeed, according to which the houses are rated,\r\n      though very unequal, is said to be always below the real value. When a\r\n      house is rebuilt, improved, or enlarged, there is a new valuation, and the\r\n      tax is rated accordingly.\r\n\r\n      The contrivers of the several taxes which in England have, at different\r\n      times, been imposed upon houses, seem to have imagined that there was some\r\n      great difficulty in ascertaining, with tolerable exactness, what was the\r\n      real rent of every house. They have regulated their taxes, therefore,\r\n      according to some more obvious circumstance, such as they had probably\r\n      imagined would, in most cases, bear some proportion to the rent.\r\n\r\n      The first tax of this kind was hearth-money; or a tax of two shillings\r\n      upon every hearth. In order to ascertain how many hearths were in the\r\n      house, it was necessary that the tax-gatherer should enter every room in\r\n      it. This odious visit rendered the tax odious. Soon after the Revolution,\r\n      therefore, it was abolished as a badge of slavery.\r\n\r\n      The next tax of this kind was a tax of two shillings upon every\r\n      dwelling-house inhabited. A house with ten windows to pay four shillings\r\n      more. A house with twenty windows and upwards to pay eight shillings. This\r\n      tax was afterwards so far altered, that houses with twenty windows, and\r\n      with less than thirty, were ordered to pay ten shillings, and those with\r\n      thirty windows and upwards to pay twenty shillings. The number of windows\r\n      can, in most cases, be counted from the outside, and, in all cases,\r\n      without entering every room in the house. The visit of the tax-gatherer,\r\n      therefore, was less offensive in this tax than in the hearth-money.\r\n\r\n      This tax was afterwards repealed, and in the room of it was established\r\n      the window-tax, which has undergone two several alterations and\r\n      augmentations. The window tax, as it stands at present (January 1775),\r\n      over and above the duty of three shillings upon every house in England,\r\n      and of one shilling upon every house in Scotland, lays a duty upon every\r\n      window, which in England augments gradually from twopence, the lowest rate\r\n      upon houses with not more than seven windows, to two shillings, the\r\n      highest rate upon houses with twenty-five windows and upwards.\r\n\r\n      The principal objection to all such taxes is their inequality; an\r\n      inequality of the worst kind, as they must frequently fall much heavier\r\n      upon the poor than upon the rich. A house of ten pounds rent in a country\r\n      town, may sometimes have more windows than a house of five hundred pounds\r\n      rent in London; and though the inhabitant of the former is likely to be a\r\n      much poorer man than that of the latter, yet, so far as his contribution\r\n      is regulated by the window tax, he must contribute more to the support of\r\n      the state. Such taxes are, therefore, directly contrary to the first of\r\n      the four maxims above mentioned. They do not seem to offend much against\r\n      any of the other three.\r\n\r\n      The natural tendency of the window tax, and of all other taxes upon\r\n      houses, is to lower rents. The more a man pays for the tax, the less, it\r\n      is evident, he can afford to pay for the rent. Since the imposition of the\r\n      window tax, however, the rents of houses have, upon the whole, risen more\r\n      or less, in almost every town and village of Great Britain, with which I\r\n      am acquainted. Such has been, almost everywhere, the increase of the\r\n      demand for houses, that it has raised the rents more than the window tax\r\n      could sink them; one of the many proofs of the great prosperity of the\r\n      country, and of the increasing revenue of its inhabitants. Had it not been\r\n      for the tax, rents would probably have risen still higher.\r\n\r\n      ARTICLE II.—Taxes upon Profit, or upon the Revenue arising from\r\n      Stock.\r\n\r\n      The revenue or profit arising from stock naturally divides itself into two\r\n      parts; that which pays the interest, and which belongs to the owner of the\r\n      stock; and that surplus part which is over and above what is necessary for\r\n      paying the interest.\r\n\r\n      This latter part of profit is evidently a subject not taxable directly. It\r\n      is the compensation, and, in most cases, it is no more than a very\r\n      moderate compensation for the risk and trouble of employing the stock. The\r\n      employer must have this compensation, otherwise he cannot, consistently\r\n      with his own interest, continue the employment. If he was taxed directly,\r\n      therefore, in proportion to the whole profit, he would be obliged either\r\n      to raise the rate of his profit, or to charge the tax upon the interest of\r\n      money; that is, to pay less interest. If he raised the rate of his profit\r\n      in proportion to the tax, the whole tax, though it might be advanced by\r\n      him, would be finally paid by one or other of two different sets of\r\n      people, according to the different ways in which he might employ the stock\r\n      of which he had the management. If he employed it as a farming stock, in\r\n      the cultivation of land, he could raise the rate of his profit only by\r\n      retaining a greater portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price\r\n      of a greater portion, of the produce of the land; and as this could be\r\n      done only by a reduction of rent, the final payment of the tax would fall\r\n      upon the landlord. If he employed it as a mercantile or manufacturing\r\n      stock, he could raise the rate of his profit only by raising the price of\r\n      his goods; in which case, the final payment of the tax would fall\r\n      altogether upon the consumers of those goods. If he did not raise the rate\r\n      of his profit, he would be obliged to charge the whole tax upon that part\r\n      of it which was allotted for the interest of money. He could afford less\r\n      interest for whatever stock he borrowed, and the whole weight of the tax\r\n      would, in this case, fall ultimately upon the interest of money. So far as\r\n      he could not relieve himself from the tax in the one way, he would be\r\n      obliged to relieve himself in the other.\r\n\r\n      The interest of money seems, at first sight, a subject equally capable of\r\n      being taxed directly as the rent of land. Like the rent of land, it is a\r\n      neat produce, which remains, after completely compensating the whole risk\r\n      and trouble of employing the stock. As a tax upon the rent of land cannot\r\n      raise rents, because the neat produce which remains, after replacing the\r\n      stock of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit, cannot be\r\n      greater after the tax than before it, so, for the same reason, a tax upon\r\n      the interest of money could not raise the rate of interest; the quantity\r\n      of stock or money in the country, like the quantity of land, being\r\n      supposed to remain the same after the tax as before it. The ordinary rate\r\n      of profit, it has been shewn, in the first book, is everywhere regulated\r\n      by the quantity of stock to be employed, in proportion to the quantity of\r\n      the employment, or of the business which must be done by it. But the\r\n      quantity of the employment, or of the business to be done by stock, could\r\n      neither be increased nor diminished by any tax upon the interest of money.\r\n      If the quantity of the stock to be employed, therefore, was neither\r\n      increased nor diminished by it, the ordinary rate of profit would\r\n      necessarily remain the same. But the portion of this profit, necessary for\r\n      compensating the risk and trouble of the employer, would likewise remain\r\n      the same; that risk and trouble being in no respect altered. The residue,\r\n      therefore, that portion which belongs to the owner of the stock, and which\r\n      pays the interest of money, would necessarily remain the same too. At\r\n      first sight, therefore, the interest of money seems to be a subject as fit\r\n      to be taxed directly as the rent of land.\r\n\r\n      There are, however, two different circumstances, which render the interest\r\n      of money a much less proper subject of direct taxation than the rent of\r\n      land.\r\n\r\n      First, the quantity and value of the land which any man possesses, can\r\n      never be a secret, and can always be ascertained with great exactness. But\r\n      the whole amount of the capital stock which he possesses is almost always\r\n      a secret, and can scarce ever be ascertained with tolerable exactness. It\r\n      is liable, besides, to almost continual variations. A year seldom passes\r\n      away, frequently not a month, sometimes scarce a single day, in which it\r\n      does not rise or fall more or less. An inquisition into every man’s\r\n      private circumstances, and an inquisition which, in order to accommodate\r\n      the tax to them, watched over all the fluctuations of his fortune, would\r\n      be a source of such continual and endless vexation as no person could\r\n      support.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, land is a subject which cannot be removed; whereas stock easily\r\n      may. The proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the particular\r\n      country in which his estate lies. The proprietor of stock is properly a\r\n      citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular\r\n      country. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to\r\n      a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax; and\r\n      would remove his stock to some other country, where he could either carry\r\n      on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease. By removing his\r\n      stock, he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in\r\n      the country which he left. Stock cultivates land; stock employs labour. A\r\n      tax which tended to drive away stock from any particular country, would so\r\n      far tend to dry up every source of revenue, both to the sovereign and to\r\n      the society. Not only the profits of stock, but the rent of land, and the\r\n      wages of labour, would necessarily be more or less diminished by its\r\n      removal.\r\n\r\n      The nations, accordingly, who have attempted to tax the revenue arising\r\n      from stock, instead of any severe inquisition of this kind, have been\r\n      obliged to content themselves with some very loose, and, therefore, more\r\n      or less arbitrary estimation. The extreme inequality and uncertainty of a\r\n      tax assessed in this manner, can be compensated only by its extreme\r\n      moderation; in consequence of which, every man finds himself rated so very\r\n      much below his real revenue, that he gives himself little disturbance\r\n      though his neighbour should be rated somewhat lower.\r\n\r\n      By what is called the land tax in England, it was intended that the stock\r\n      should be taxed in the same proportion as land. When the tax upon land was\r\n      at four shillings in the pound, or at one-fifth of the supposed rent, it\r\n      was intended that stock should be taxed at one-fifth of the supposed\r\n      interest. When the present annual land tax was first imposed, the legal\r\n      rate of interest was six per cent. Every hundred pounds stock,\r\n      accordingly, was supposed to be taxed at twenty-four shillings, the fifth\r\n      part of six pounds. Since the legal rate of interest has been reduced to\r\n      five per cent. every hundred pounds stock is supposed to be taxed at\r\n      twenty shillings only. The sum to be raised, by what is called the land\r\n      tax, was divided between the country and the principal towns. The greater\r\n      part of it was laid upon the country; and of what was laid upon the towns,\r\n      the greater part was assessed upon the houses. What remained to be\r\n      assessed upon the stock or trade of the towns (for the stock upon the land\r\n      was not meant to be taxed) was very much below the real value of that\r\n      stock or trade. Whatever inequalities, therefore, there might be in the\r\n      original assessment, gave little disturbance. Every parish and district\r\n      still continues to be rated for its land, its houses, and its stock,\r\n      according to the original assessment; and the almost universal prosperity\r\n      of the country, which, in most places, has raised very much the value of\r\n      all these, has rendered those inequalities of still less importance now.\r\n      The rate, too, upon each district, continuing always the same, the\r\n      uncertainty of this tax, so far as it might he assessed upon the stock of\r\n      any individual, has been very much diminished, as well as rendered of much\r\n      less consequence. If the greater part of the lands of England are not\r\n      rated to the land tax at half their actual value, the greater part of the\r\n      stock of England is, perhaps, scarce rated at the fiftieth part of its\r\n      actual value. In some towns, the whole land tax is assessed upon houses;\r\n      as in Westminster, where stock and trade are free. It is otherwise in\r\n      London.\r\n\r\n      In all countries, a severe inquisition into the circumstances of private\r\n      persons has been carefully avoided.\r\n\r\n      At Hamburg, {Memoires concernant les Droits, tom. i, p.74} every\r\n      inhabitant is obliged to pay to the state one fourth per cent. of all that\r\n      he possesses; and as the wealth of the people of Hamburg consists\r\n      principally in stock, this tax maybe considered as a tax upon stock. Every\r\n      man assesses himself, and, in the presence of the magistrate, puts\r\n      annually into the public coffer a certain sum of money, which he declares\r\n      upon oath, to be one fourth per cent. of all that he possesses, but\r\n      without declaring what it amounts to, or being liable to any examination\r\n      upon that subject. This tax is generally supposed to be paid with great\r\n      fidelity. In a small republic, where the people have entire confidence in\r\n      their magistrates, are convinced of the necessity of the tax for the\r\n      support of the state, and believe that it will be faithfully applied to\r\n      that purpose, such conscientious and voluntary payment may sometimes be\r\n      expected. It is not peculiar to the people of Hamburg.\r\n\r\n      The canton of Underwald, in Switzerland, is frequently ravaged by storms\r\n      and inundations, and it is thereby exposed to extraordinary expenses. Upon\r\n      such occasions the people assemble, and every one is said to declare with\r\n      the greatest frankness what he is worth, in order to be taxed accordingly.\r\n      At Zurich, the law orders, that in cases of necessity, every one should be\r\n      taxed in proportion to his revenue; the amount of which he is obliged to\r\n      declare upon oath. They have no suspicion, it is said, that any of their\r\n      fellow citizens will deceive them. At Basil, the principal revenue of the\r\n      state arises from a small custom upon goods exported. All the citizens\r\n      make oath, that they will pay every three months all the taxes imposed by\r\n      law. All merchants, and even all inn-keepers, are trusted with keeping\r\n      themselves the account of the goods which they sell, either within or\r\n      without the territory. At the end of every three months, they send this\r\n      account to the treasurer, with the amount of the tax computed at the\r\n      bottom of it. It is not suspected that the revenue suffers by this\r\n      confidence. {Memoires concernant les Droits, tom. i p. 163, 167,171.}\r\n\r\n      To oblige every citizen to declare publicly upon oath, the amount of his\r\n      fortune, must not, it seems, in those Swiss cantons, be reckoned a\r\n      hardship. At Hamburg it would be reckoned the greatest. Merchants engaged\r\n      in the hazardous projects of trade, all tremble at the thoughts of being\r\n      obliged, at all times, to expose the real state of their circumstances.\r\n      The ruin of their credit, and the miscarriage of their projects, they\r\n      foresee, would too often be the consequence. A sober and parsimonious\r\n      people, who are strangers to all such projects, do not feel that they have\r\n      occasion for any such concealment.\r\n\r\n      In Holland, soon after the exaltation of the late prince of Orange to the\r\n      stadtholdership, a tax of two per cent. or the fiftieth penny, as it was\r\n      called, was imposed upon the whole substance of every citizen. Every\r\n      citizen assesed himself, and paid his tax, in the same manner as at\r\n      Hamburg, and it was in general supposed to have been paid with great\r\n      fidelity. The people had at that time the greatest affection for their new\r\n      government, which they had just established by a general insurrection. The\r\n      tax was to be paid but once, in order to relieve the state in a particular\r\n      exigency. It was, indeed, too heavy to be permanent. In a country where\r\n      the market rate of interest seldom exceeds three per cent., a tax of two\r\n      per cent. amounts to thirteen shillings and four pence in the pound, upon\r\n      the highest neat revenue which is commonly drawn from stock. It is a tax\r\n      which very few people could pay, without encroaching more or less upon\r\n      their capitals. In a particular exigency, the people may, from great\r\n      public zeal, make a great effort, and give up even a part of their\r\n      capital, in order to relieve the state. But it is impossible that they\r\n      should continue to do so for any considerable time; and if they did, the\r\n      tax would soon ruin them so completely, as to render them altogether\r\n      incapable of supporting the state.\r\n\r\n      The tax upon stock, imposed by the land tax bill in England, though it is\r\n      proportioned to the capital, is not intended to diminish or, take away any\r\n      part of that capital. It is meant only to be a tax upon the interest of\r\n      money, proportioned to that upon the rent of land; so that when the latter\r\n      is at four shillings in the pound, the former may be at four shillings in\r\n      the pound too. The tax at Hamburg, and the still more moderate taxes of\r\n      Underwald and Zurich, are meant, in the same manner, to be taxes, not upon\r\n      the capital, but upon the interest or neat revenue of stock. That of\r\n      Holland was meant to be a tax upon the capital.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the Profit of particular Employments.\r\n\r\n      In some countries, extraordinary taxes are imposed upon the profits of\r\n      stock; sometimes when employed in particular branches of trade, and\r\n      sometimes when employed in agriculture.\r\n\r\n      Of the former kind, are in England, the tax upon hawkers and pedlars, that\r\n      upon hackney-coaches and chairs, and that which the keepers of ale-houses\r\n      pay for a licence to retail ale and spiritous liquors. During the late\r\n      war, another tax of the same kind was proposed upon shops. The war having\r\n      been undertaken, it was said, in defence of the trade of the country, the\r\n      merchants, who were to profit by it, ought to contribute towards the\r\n      support of it.\r\n\r\n      A tax, however, upon the profits of stock employed in any particular\r\n      branch of trade, can never fall finally upon the dealers (who must in all\r\n      ordinary cases have their reasonable profit, and, where the competition is\r\n      free, can seldom have more than that profit), but always upon the\r\n      consumers, who must be obliged to pay in the price of the goods the tax\r\n      which the dealer advances; and generally with some overcharge.\r\n\r\n      A tax of this kind, when it is proportioned to the trade of the dealer, is\r\n      finally paid by the consumer, and occasions no oppression to the dealer.\r\n      When it is not so proportioned, but is the same upon all dealers, though\r\n      in this case, too, it is finally paid by the consumer, yet it favours the\r\n      great, and occasions some oppression to the small dealer. The tax of five\r\n      shillings a-week upon every hackney coach, and that of ten shillings\r\n      a-year upon every hackney chair, so far as it is advanced by the different\r\n      keepers of such coaches and chairs, is exactly enough proportioned to the\r\n      extent of their respective dealings. It neither favours the great, nor\r\n      oppresses the smaller dealer. The tax of twenty shillings a-year for a\r\n      licence to sell ale; of forty shillings for a licence to sell spiritous\r\n      liquors; and of forty shillings more for a licence to sell wine, being the\r\n      same upon all retailers, must necessarily give some advantage to the\r\n      great, and occasion some oppression to the small dealers. The former must\r\n      find it more easy to get back the tax in the price of their goods than the\r\n      latter. The moderation of the tax, however, renders this inequality of\r\n      less importance; and it may to many people appear not improper to give\r\n      some discouragement to the multiplication of little ale-houses. The tax\r\n      upon shops, it was intended, should be the same upon all shops. It could\r\n      not well have been otherwise. It would have been impossible to proportion,\r\n      with tolerable exactness, the tax upon a shop to the extent of the trade\r\n      carried on in it, without such an inquisition as would have been\r\n      altogether insupportable in a free country. If the tax had been\r\n      considerable, it would have oppressed the small, and forced almost the\r\n      whole retail trade into the hands of the great dealers. The competition of\r\n      the former being taken away, the latter would have enjoyed a monopoly of\r\n      the trade; and, like all other monopolists, would soon have combined to\r\n      raise their profits much beyond what was necessary for the payment of the\r\n      tax. The final payment, instead of falling upon the shop-keeper, would\r\n      have fallen upon the consumer, with a considerable overcharge to the\r\n      profit of the shop-keeper. For these reasons, the project of a tax upon\r\n      shops was laid aside, and in the room of it was substituted the subsidy,\r\n      1759.\r\n\r\n      What in France is called the personal taille, is perhaps, the most\r\n      important tax upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture, that is\r\n      levied in any part of Europe.\r\n\r\n      In the disorderly state of Europe, during the prevalence of the feudal\r\n      government, the sovereign was obliged to content himself with taxing those\r\n      who were too weak to refuse to pay taxes. The great lords, though willing\r\n      to assist him upon particular emergencies, refused to subject themselves\r\n      to any constant tax, and he was not strong enough to force them. The\r\n      occupiers of land all over Europe were, the greater part of them,\r\n      originally bond-men. Through the greater part of Europe, they were\r\n      gradually emancipated. Some of them acquired the property of landed\r\n      estates, which they held by some base or ignoble tenure, sometimes under\r\n      the king, and sometimes under some other great lord, like the ancient\r\n      copy-holders of England. Others, without acquiring the property, obtained\r\n      leases for terms of years, of the lands which they occupied under their\r\n      lord, and thus became less dependent upon him. The great lords seem to\r\n      have beheld the degree of prosperity and independency, which this inferior\r\n      order of men had thus come to enjoy, with a malignant and contemptuous\r\n      indignation, and willingly consented that the sovereign should tax them.\r\n      In some countries, this tax was confined to the lands which were held in\r\n      property by an ignoble tenure; and, in this case, the taille was said to\r\n      be real. The land tax established by the late king of Sardinia, and the\r\n      taille in the provinces of Languedoc, Provence, Dauphine, and Britanny; in\r\n      the generality of Montauban, and in the elections of Agen and Condom, as\r\n      well as in some other districts of France; are taxes upon lands held in\r\n      property by an ignoble tenure. In other countries, the tax was laid upon\r\n      the supposed profits of all those who held, in farm or lease, lands\r\n      belonging to other people, whatever might be the tenure by which the\r\n      proprietor held them; and in this case, the taille was said to be\r\n      personal. In the greater part of those provinces of France, which are\r\n      called the countries of elections, the taille is of this kind. The real\r\n      taille, as it is imposed only upon a part of the lands of the country, is\r\n      necessarily an unequal, but it is not always an arbitrary tax, though it\r\n      is so upon some occasions. The personal taille, as it is intended to be\r\n      proportioned to the profits of a certain class of people, which can only\r\n      be guessed at, is necessarily both arbitrary and unequal.\r\n\r\n      In France, the personal taille at present (1775) annually imposed upon the\r\n      twenty generalities, called the countries of elections, amounts to\r\n      40,107,239 livres, 16 sous. {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc tom. ii,\r\n      p.17.} the proportion in which this sum is assessed upon those different\r\n      provinces, varies from year to year, according to the reports which are\r\n      made to the king’s council concerning the goodness or badness of the\r\n      crops, as well as other circumstances, which may either increase or\r\n      diminish their respective abilities to pay. Each generality is divided\r\n      into a certain number of elections; and the proportion in which the sum\r\n      imposed upon the whole generality is divided among those different\r\n      elections, varies likewise from year to year, according to the reports\r\n      made to the council concerning their respective abilities. It seems\r\n      impossible, that the council, with the best intentions, can ever\r\n      proportion, with tolerable exactness, either of these two assessments to\r\n      the real abilities of the province or district upon which they are\r\n      respectively laid. Ignorance and misinformation must always, more or less,\r\n      mislead the most upright council. The proportion which each parish ought\r\n      to support of what is assessed upon the whole election, and that which\r\n      each individual ought to support of what is assessed upon his particular\r\n      parish, are both in the same manner varied from year to year, according as\r\n      circumstances are supposed to require. These circumstances are judged of,\r\n      in the one case, by the officers of the election, in the other, by those\r\n      of the parish; and both the one and the other are, more or less, under the\r\n      direction and influence of the intendant. Not only ignorance and\r\n      misinformation, but friendship, party animosity, and private resentment,\r\n      are said frequently to mislead such assessors. No man subject to such a\r\n      tax, it is evident, can ever be certain, before he is assessed, of what he\r\n      is to pay. He cannot even be certain after he is assessed. If any person\r\n      has been taxed who ought to have been exempted, or if any person has been\r\n      taxed beyond his proportion, though both must pay in the mean time, yet if\r\n      they complain, and make good their complaints, the whole parish is\r\n      reimposed next year, in order to reimburse them. If any of the\r\n      contributors become bankrupt or insolvent, the collector is obliged to\r\n      advance his tax; and the whole parish is reimposed next year, in order to\r\n      reimburse the collector. If the collector himself should become bankrupt,\r\n      the parish which elects him must answer for his conduct to the\r\n      receiver-general of the election. But, as it might be troublesome for the\r\n      receiver to prosecute the whole parish, he takes at his choice five or six\r\n      of the richest contributors, and obliges them to make good what had been\r\n      lost by the insolvency of the collector. The parish is afterwards\r\n      reimposed, in order to reimburse those five or six. Such reimpositions are\r\n      always over and above the taille of the particular year in which they are\r\n      laid on.\r\n\r\n      When a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock in a particular branch of\r\n      trade, the traders are all careful to bring no more goods to market than\r\n      what they can sell at a price sufficient to reimburse them from advancing\r\n      the tax. Some of them withdraw a part of their stocks from the trade, and\r\n      the market is more sparingly supplied than before. The price of the goods\r\n      rises, and the final payment of the tax falls upon the consumer. But when\r\n      a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture, it is\r\n      not the interest of the farmers to withdraw any part of their stock from\r\n      that employment. Each farmer occupies a certain quantity of land, for\r\n      which he pays rent. For the proper cultivation of this land, a certain\r\n      quantity of stock is necessary; and by withdrawing any part of this\r\n      necessary quantity, the farmer is not likely to be more able to pay either\r\n      the rent or the tax. In order to pay the tax, it can never be his interest\r\n      to diminish the quantity of his produce, nor consequently to supply the\r\n      market more sparingly than before. The tax, therefore, will never enable\r\n      him to raise the price of his produce, so as to reimburse himself, by\r\n      throwing the final payment upon the consumer. The farmer, however, must\r\n      have his reasonable profit as well as every other dealer, otherwise he\r\n      must give up the trade. After the imposition of a tax of this kind, he can\r\n      get this reasonable profit only by paying less rent to the landlord. The\r\n      more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he can afford to pay\r\n      in the way of rent. A tax of this kind, imposed during the currency of a\r\n      lease, may, no doubt, distress or ruin the farmer. Upon the renewal of the\r\n      lease, it must always fall upon the landlord.\r\n\r\n      In the countries where the personal taille takes place, the farmer is\r\n      commonly assessed in proportion to the stock which he appears to employ in\r\n      cultivation. He is, upon this account, frequently afraid to have a good\r\n      team of horses or oxen, but endeavours to cultivate with the meanest and\r\n      most wretched instruments of husbandry that he can. Such is his distrust\r\n      in the justice of his assessors, that he counterfeits poverty, and wishes\r\n      to appear scarce able to pay anything, for fear of being obliged to pay\r\n      too much. By this miserable policy, he does not, perhaps, always consult\r\n      his own interest in the most effectual manner; and he probably loses more\r\n      by the diminution of his produce, than he saves by that of his tax.\r\n      Though, in consequence of this wretched cultivation, the market is, no\r\n      doubt, somewhat worse supplied; yet the small rise of price which this may\r\n      occasion, as it is not likely even to indemnify the farmer for the\r\n      diminution of his produce, it is still less likely to enable him to pay\r\n      more rent to the landlord. The public, the farmer, the landlord, all\r\n      suffer more or less by this degraded cultivation. That the personal taille\r\n      tends, in many different ways, to discourage cultivation, and consequently\r\n      to dry up the principal source of the wealth of every great country, I\r\n      have already had occasion to observe in the third book of this Inquiry.\r\n\r\n      What are called poll-taxes in the southern provinces of North America, and\r\n      the West India islands, annual taxes of so much a-head upon every negro,\r\n      are properly taxes upon the profits of a certain species of stock employed\r\n      in agriculture. As the planters, are the greater part of them, both\r\n      farmers and landlords, the final payment of the tax falls upon them in\r\n      their quality of landlords, without any retribution.\r\n\r\n      Taxes of so much a head upon the bondmen employed in cultivation, seem\r\n      anciently to have been common all over Europe. There subsists at present a\r\n      tax of this kind in the empire of Russia. It is probably upon this account\r\n      that poll-taxes of all kinds have often been represented as badges of\r\n      slavery. Every tax, however, is, to the person who pays it, a badge, not\r\n      of slavery, but of liberty. It denotes that he is subject to government,\r\n      indeed; but that, as he has some property, he cannot himself be the\r\n      property of a master. A poll tax upon slaves is altogether different from\r\n      a poll-tax upon freemen. The latter is paid by the persons upon whom it is\r\n      imposed; the former, by a different set of persons. The latter is either\r\n      altogether arbitrary, or altogether unequal, and, in most cases, is both\r\n      the one and the other; the former, though in some respects unequal,\r\n      different slaves being of different values, is in no respect arbitrary.\r\n      Every master, who knows the number of his own slaves, knows exactly what\r\n      he has to pay. Those different taxes, however, being called by the same\r\n      name, have been considered as of the same nature.\r\n\r\n      The taxes which in Holland are imposed upon men and maid servants, are\r\n      taxes, not upon stock, but upon expense; and so far resemble the taxes\r\n      upon consumable commodities. The tax of a guinea a-head for every\r\n      man-servant, which has lately been imposed in Great Britain, is of the\r\n      same kind. It falls heaviest upon the middling rank. A man of two hundred\r\n      a-year may keep a single man-servant. A man of ten thousand a-year will\r\n      not keep fifty. It does not affect the poor.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the profits of stock, in particular employments, can never\r\n      affect the interest of money. Nobody will lend his money for less interest\r\n      to those who exercise the taxed, than to those who exercise the untaxed\r\n      employments. Taxes upon the revenue arising from stock in all employments,\r\n      where the government attempts to levy them with any degree of exactness,\r\n      will, in many cases, fall upon the interest of money. The vingtieme, or\r\n      twentieth penny, in France, is a tax of the same kind with what is called\r\n      the land tax in England, and is assessed, in the same manner, upon the\r\n      revenue arising upon land, houses, and stock. So far as it affects stock,\r\n      it is assessed, though not with great rigour, yet with much more exactness\r\n      than that part of the land tax in England which is imposed upon the same\r\n      fund. It, in many cases, falls altogether upon the interest of money.\r\n      Money is frequently sunk in France, upon what are called contracts for the\r\n      constitution of a rent; that is, perpetual annuities, redeemable at any\r\n      time by the debtor, upon payment of the sum originally advanced, but of\r\n      which this redemption is not exigible by the creditor except in particular\r\n      cases. The vingtieme seems not to have raised the rate of those annuities,\r\n      though it is exactly levied upon them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      APPENDIX TO ARTICLES I. AND II.—Taxes upon the Capital Value of\r\n      Lands, Houses, and Stock.\r\n\r\n      While property remains in the possession of the same person, whatever\r\n      permanent taxes may have been imposed upon it, they have never been\r\n      intended to diminish or take away any part of its capital value, but only\r\n      some part of the revenue arising from it. But when property changes hands,\r\n      when it is transmitted either from the dead to the living, or from the\r\n      living to the living, such taxes have frequently been imposed upon it as\r\n      necessarily take away some part of its capital value.\r\n\r\n      The transference of all sorts of property from the dead to the living, and\r\n      that of immoveable property of land and houses from the living to the\r\n      living, are transactions which are in their nature either public and\r\n      notorious, or such as cannot be long concealed. Such transactions,\r\n      therefore, may be taxed directly. The transference of stock or moveable\r\n      property, from the living to the living, by the lending of money, is\r\n      frequently a secret transaction, and may always be made so. It cannot\r\n      easily, therefore, be taxed directly. It has been taxed indirectly in two\r\n      different ways; first, by requiring that the deed, containing the\r\n      obligation to repay, should be written upon paper or parchment which had\r\n      paid a certain stamp duty, otherwise not to be valid; secondly, by\r\n      requiring, under the like penalty of invalidity, that it should be\r\n      recorded either in a public or secret register, and by imposing certain\r\n      duties upon such registration. Stamp duties, and duties of registration,\r\n      have frequently been imposed likewise upon the deeds transferring property\r\n      of all kinds from the dead to the living, and upon those transferring\r\n      immoveable property from the living to the living; transactions which\r\n      might easily have been taxed directly.\r\n\r\n      The vicesima hereditatum, or the twentieth penny of inheritances, imposed\r\n      by Augustus upon the ancient Romans, was a tax upon the transference of\r\n      property from the dead to the living. Dion Cassius, { Lib. 55. See also\r\n      Burman. de Vectigalibus Pop. Rom. cap. xi. and Bouchaud de l’impot du\r\n      vingtieme sur les successions.} the author who writes concerning it the\r\n      least indistinctly, says, that it was imposed upon all successions,\r\n      legacies and donations, in case of death, except upon those to the nearest\r\n      relations, and to the poor.\r\n\r\n      Of the same kind is the Dutch tax upon successions. {See Memoires\r\n      concernant les Droits, etc. tom i, p. 225.} Collateral successions are\r\n      taxed according to the degree of relation, from five to thirty per cent.\r\n      upon the whole value of the succession. Testamentary donations, or\r\n      legacies to collaterals, are subject to the like duties. Those from\r\n      husband to wife, or from wife to husband, to the fiftieth penny. The\r\n      luctuosa hereditas, the mournful succession of ascendants to descendants,\r\n      to the twentieth penny only. Direct successions, or those of descendants\r\n      to ascendants, pay no tax. The death of a father, to such of his children\r\n      as live in the same house with him, is seldom attended with any increase,\r\n      and frequently with a considerable diminution of revenue; by the loss of\r\n      his industry, of his office, or of some life-rent estate, of which he may\r\n      have been in possession. That tax would be cruel and oppressive, which\r\n      aggravated their loss, by taking from them any part of his succession. It\r\n      may, however, sometimes be otherwise with those children, who, in the\r\n      language of the Roman law, are said to be emancipated; in that of the\r\n      Scotch law, to be foris-familiated; that is, who have received their\r\n      portion, have got families of their own, and are supported by funds\r\n      separate and independent of those of their father. Whatever part of his\r\n      succession might come to such children, would be a real addition to their\r\n      fortune, and might, therefore, perhaps, without more inconveniency than\r\n      what attends all duties of this kind, be liable to some tax. The\r\n      casualties of the feudal law were taxes upon the transference of land,\r\n      both from the dead to the living, and from the living to the living. In\r\n      ancient times, they constituted, in every part of Europe, one of the\r\n      principal branches of the revenue of the crown.\r\n\r\n      The heir of every immediate vassal of the crown paid a certain duty,\r\n      generally a year’s rent, upon receiving the investiture of the estate. If\r\n      the heir was a minor, the whole rents of the estate, during the\r\n      continuance of the minority, devolved to the superior, without any other\r\n      charge besides the maintenance of the minor, and the payment of the\r\n      widow’s dower, when there happened to be a dowager upon the land. When the\r\n      minor came to be of age, another tax, called relief, was still due to the\r\n      superior, which generally amounted likewise to a year’s rent. A long\r\n      minority, which, in the present times, so frequently disburdens a great\r\n      estate of all its incumbrances, and restores the family to their ancient\r\n      splendour, could in those times have no such effect. The waste, and not\r\n      the disincumbrance of the estate, was the common effect of a long\r\n      minority.\r\n\r\n      By a feudal law, the vassal could not alienate without the consent of his\r\n      superior, who generally extorted a fine or composition on granting it.\r\n      This fine, which was at first arbitrary, came, in many countries, to be\r\n      regulated at a certain portion of the price of the land. In some\r\n      countries, where the greater part of the other feudal customs have gone\r\n      into disuse, this tax upon the alienation of land still continues to make\r\n      a very considerable branch of the revenue of the sovereign. In the canton\r\n      of Berne it is so high as a sixth part of the price of all noble fiefs,\r\n      and a tenth part of that of all ignoble ones. {Memoires concernant les\r\n      Droits, etc, tom.i p.154} In the canton of Lucern, the tax upon the sale\r\n      of land is not universal, and takes place only in certain districts. But\r\n      if any person sells his land in order to remove out of the territory, he\r\n      pays ten per cent. upon the whole price of the sale. {id. p.157.} Taxes of\r\n      the same kind, upon the sale either of all lands, or of lands held by\r\n      certain tenures, take place in many other countries, and make a more or\r\n      less considerable branch of the revenue of the sovereign.\r\n\r\n      Such transactions may be taxed indirectly, by means either of stamp\r\n      duties, or of duties upon registration; and those duties either may, or\r\n      may not, be proportioned to the value of the subject which is transferred.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, the stamp duties are higher or lower, not so much\r\n      according to the value of the property transferred (an eighteen-penny or\r\n      half-crown stamp being sufficient upon a bond for the largest sum of\r\n      money), as according to the nature of the deed. The highest do not exceed\r\n      six pounds upon every sheet of paper, or skin of parchment; and these high\r\n      duties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown, and upon certain law\r\n      proceedings, without any regard to the value of the subject. There are, in\r\n      Great Britain, no duties on the registration of deeds or writings, except\r\n      the fees of the officers who keep the register; and these are seldom more\r\n      than a reasonable recompence for their labour. The crown derives no\r\n      revenue from them.\r\n\r\n      In Holland {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom. i. p 223, 224, 225.}\r\n      there are both stamp duties and duties upon registration; which in some\r\n      cases are, and in some are not, proportioned to the value of the property\r\n      transferred. All testaments must be written upon stamped paper, of which\r\n      the price is proportioned to the property disposed of; so that there are\r\n      stamps which cost from three pence or three stivers a-sheet, to three\r\n      hundred florins, equal to about twenty-seven pounds ten shillings of our\r\n      money. If the stamp is of an inferior price to what the testator ought to\r\n      have made use of, his succession is confiscated. This is over and above\r\n      all their other taxes on succession. Except bills of exchange, and some\r\n      other mercantile bills, all other deeds, bonds, and contracts, are subject\r\n      to a stamp duty. This duty, however, does not rise in proportion to the\r\n      value of the subject. All sales of land and of houses, and all mortgages\r\n      upon either, must be registered, and, upon registration, pay a duty to the\r\n      state of two and a-half per cent. upon the amount of the price or of the\r\n      mortgage. This duty is extended to the sale of all ships and vessels of\r\n      more than two tons burden, whether decked or undecked. These, it seems,\r\n      are considered as a sort of houses upon the water. The sale of moveables,\r\n      when it is ordered by a court of justice, is subject to the like duty of\r\n      two and a-half per cent.\r\n\r\n      In France, there are both stamp duties and duties upon registration. The\r\n      former are considered as a branch of the aids of excise, and, in the\r\n      provinces where those duties take place, are levied by the excise\r\n      officers. The latter are considered as a branch of the domain of the crown\r\n      and are levied by a different set of officers.\r\n\r\n      Those modes of taxation by stamp duties and by duties upon registration,\r\n      are of very modern invention. In the course of little more than a century,\r\n      however, stamp duties have, in Europe, become almost universal, and duties\r\n      upon registration extremely common. There is no art which one government\r\n      sooner learns of another, than that of draining money from the pockets of\r\n      the people.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the transference of property from the dead to the living, fall\r\n      finally, as well as immediately, upon the persons to whom the property is\r\n      transferred. Taxes upon the sale of land fall altogether upon the seller.\r\n      The seller is almost always under the necessity of selling, and must,\r\n      therefore, take such a price as he can get. The buyer is scarce ever under\r\n      the necessity of buying, and will, therefore, only give such a price as he\r\n      likes. He considers what the land will cost him, in tax and price\r\n      together. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he\r\n      will be disposed to give in the way of price. Such taxes, therefore, fall\r\n      almost always upon a necessitous person, and must, therefore, be\r\n      frequently very cruel and oppressive. Taxes upon the sale of new-built\r\n      houses, where the building is sold without the ground, fall generally upon\r\n      the buyer, because the builder must generally have his profit; otherwise\r\n      he must give up the trade. If he advances the tax, therefore, the buyer\r\n      must generally repay it to him. Taxes upon the sale of old houses, for the\r\n      same reason as those upon the sale of land, fall generally upon the\r\n      seller; whom, in most cases, either conveniency or necessity obliges to\r\n      sell. The number of new-built houses that are annually brought to market,\r\n      is more or less regulated by the demand. Unless the demand is such as to\r\n      afford the builder his profit, after paying all expenses, he will build no\r\n      more houses. The number of old houses which happen at any time to come to\r\n      market, is regulated by accidents, of which the greater part have no\r\n      relation to the demand. Two or three great bankruptcies in a mercantile\r\n      town, will bring many houses to sale, which must be sold for what can be\r\n      got for them. Taxes upon the sale of ground-rents fall altogether upon the\r\n      seller, for the same reason as those upon the sale of lands. Stamp duties,\r\n      and duties upon the registration of bonds and contracts for borrowed\r\n      money, fall altogether upon the borrower, and, in fact, are always paid by\r\n      him. Duties of the same kind upon law proceedings fall upon the suitors.\r\n      They reduce to both the capital value of the subject in dispute. The more\r\n      it costs to acquire any property, the less must be the neat value of it\r\n      when acquired.\r\n\r\n      All taxes upon the transference of property of every kind, so far as they\r\n      diminish the capital value of that property, tend to diminish the funds\r\n      destined for the maintenance of productive labour. They are all more or\r\n      less unthrifty taxes that increase the revenue of the sovereign, which\r\n      seldom maintains any but unproductive labourers, at the expense of the\r\n      capital of the people, which maintains none but productive.\r\n\r\n      Such taxes, even when they are proportioned to the value of the property\r\n      transferred, are still unequal; the frequency of transference not being\r\n      always equal in property of equal value. When they are not proportioned to\r\n      this value, which is the case with the greater part of the stamp duties\r\n      and duties of registration, they are still more so. They are in no respect\r\n      arbitrary, but are, or may be, in all cases, perfectly clear and certain.\r\n      Though they sometimes fall upon the person who is not very able to pay,\r\n      the time of payment is, in most cases, sufficiently convenient for him.\r\n      When the payment becomes due, he must, in most cases, have the more to\r\n      pay. They are levied at very little expense, and in general subject the\r\n      contributors to no other inconveniency, besides always the unavoidable one\r\n      of paying the tax. In France, the stamp duties are not much complained of.\r\n      Those of registration, which they call the Controle, are. They give\r\n      occasion, it is pretended, to much extortion in the officers of the\r\n      farmers-general who collect the tax, which is in a great measure arbitrary\r\n      and uncertain. In the greater part of the libels which have been written\r\n      against the present system of finances in France, the abuses of the\r\n      controle make a principal article. Uncertainty, however, does not seem to\r\n      be necessarily inherent in the nature of such taxes. If the popular\r\n      complaints are well founded, the abuse must arise, not so much from the\r\n      nature of the tax as from the want of precision and distinctness in the\r\n      words of the edicts or laws which impose it.\r\n\r\n      The registration of mortgages, and in general of all rights upon\r\n      immoveable property, as it gives great security both to creditors and\r\n      purchasers, is extremely advantageous to the public. That of the greater\r\n      part of deeds of other kinds, is frequently inconvenient and even\r\n      dangerous to individuals, without any advantage to the public. All\r\n      registers which, it is acknowledged, ought to be kept secret, ought\r\n      certainly never to exist. The credit of individuals ought certainly never\r\n      to depend upon so very slender a security, as the probity and religion of\r\n      the inferior officers of revenue. But where the fees of registration have\r\n      been made a source of revenue to the sovereign, register-offices have\r\n      commonly been multiplied without end, both for the deeds which ought to be\r\n      registered, and for those which ought not. In France there are several\r\n      different sorts of secret registers. This abuse, though not perhaps a\r\n      necessary, it must be acknowledged, is a very natural effect of such\r\n      taxes.\r\n\r\n      Such stamp duties as those in England upon cards and dice, upon newspapers\r\n      and periodical pamphlets, etc. are properly taxes upon consumption; the\r\n      final payment falls upon the persons who use or consume such commodities.\r\n      Such stamp duties as those upon licences to retail ale, wine, and\r\n      spiritous liquors, though intended, perhaps, to fall upon the profits of\r\n      the retailers, are likewise finally paid by the consumers of those\r\n      liquors. Such taxes, though called by the same name, and levied by the\r\n      same officers, and in the same manner with the stamp duties above\r\n      mentioned upon the transference of property, are, however, of a quite\r\n      different nature, and fall upon quite different funds.\r\n\r\n      ARTICLE III.—Taxes upon the Wages of Labour.\r\n\r\n      The wages of the inferior classes of work men, I have endeavoured to show\r\n      in the first book are everywhere necessarily regulated by two different\r\n      circumstances; the demand for labour, and the ordinary or average price of\r\n      provisions. The demand for labour, according as it happens to be either\r\n      increasing, stationary, or declining; or to require an increasing,\r\n      stationary, or declining population, regulates the subsistence of the\r\n      labourer, and determines in what degree it shall be either liberal,\r\n      moderate, or scanty. The ordinary average price of provisions determines\r\n      the quantity of money which must be paid to the workman, in order to\r\n      enable him, one year with another, to purchase this liberal, moderate, or\r\n      scanty subsistence. While the demand for the labour and the price of\r\n      provisions, therefore, remain the same, a direct tax upon the wages of\r\n      labour can have no other effect, than to raise them somewhat higher than\r\n      the tax. Let us suppose, for example, that, in a particular place, the\r\n      demand for labour and the price of provisions were such as to render ten\r\n      shillings a-week the ordinary wages of labour; and that a tax of\r\n      one-fifth, or four shillings in the pound, was imposed upon wages. If the\r\n      demand for labour and the price of provisions remained the same, it would\r\n      still be necessary that the labourer should, in that place, earn such a\r\n      subsistence as could be bought only for ten shillings a-week; so that,\r\n      after paying the tax, he should have ten shillings a-week free wages. But,\r\n      in order to leave him such free wages, after paying such a tax, the price\r\n      of labour must, in that place, soon rise, not to twelve shillings a week\r\n      only, but to twelve and sixpence; that is, in order to enable him to pay a\r\n      tax of one-fifth, his wages must necessarily soon rise, not one-fifth part\r\n      only, but one-fourth. Whatever was the proportion of the tax, the wages of\r\n      labour must, in all cases rise, not only in that proportion, but in a\r\n      higher proportion. If the tax for example, was one-tenth, the wages of\r\n      labour must necessarily soon rise, not one-tenth part only, but\r\n      one-eighth.\r\n\r\n      A direct tax upon the wages of labour, therefore, though the labourer\r\n      might, perhaps, pay it out of his hand, could not properly be said to be\r\n      even advanced by him; at least if the demand for labour and the average\r\n      price of provisions remained the same after the tax as before it. In all\r\n      such cases, not only the tax, but something more than the tax, would in\r\n      reality be advanced by the person who immediately employed him. The final\r\n      payment would, in different cases, fall upon different persons. The rise\r\n      which such a tax might occasion in the wages of manufacturing labour would\r\n      be advanced by the master manufacturer, who would both be entitled and\r\n      obliged to charge it, with a profit, upon the price of his goods. The\r\n      final payment of this rise of wages, therefore, together with the\r\n      additional profit of the master manufacturer would fall upon the consumer.\r\n      The rise which such a tax might occasion in the wages of country labour\r\n      would be advanced by the farmer, who, in order to maintain the same number\r\n      of labourers as before, would be obliged to employ a greater capital. In\r\n      order to get back this greater capital, together with the ordinary profits\r\n      of stock, it would be necessary that he should retain a larger portion,\r\n      or, what comes to the same thing, the price of a larger portion, of the\r\n      produce of the land, and, consequently, that he should pay less rent to\r\n      the landlord. The final payment of this rise of wages, therefore, would,\r\n      in this case, fall upon the landlord, together with the additional profit\r\n      of the farmer who had advanced it. In all cases, a direct tax upon the\r\n      wages of labour must, in the long-run, occasion both a greater reduction\r\n      in the rent of land, and a greater rise in the price of manufactured goods\r\n      than would have followed from the proper assessment of a sum equal to the\r\n      produce of the tax, partly upon the rent of land, and partly upon\r\n      consumable commodities.\r\n\r\n      If direct taxes upon the wages of labour have not always occasioned a\r\n      proportionable rise in those wages, it is because they have generally\r\n      occasioned a considerable fall in the demand of labour. The declension of\r\n      industry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of the country, have generally been\r\n      the effects of such taxes. In consequence of them, however, the price of\r\n      labour must always be higher than it otherwise would have been in the\r\n      actual state of the demand; and this enhancement of price, together with\r\n      the profit of those who advance it, must always be finally paid by the\r\n      landlords and consumers.\r\n\r\n      A tax upon the wages of country labour does not raise the price of the\r\n      rude produce of land in proportion to the tax; for the same reason that a\r\n      tax upon the farmer’s profit does not raise that price in that proportion.\r\n\r\n      Absurd and destructive as such taxes are, however, they take place in many\r\n      countries. In France, that part of the taille which is charged upon the\r\n      industry of workmen and day-labourers in country villages, is properly a\r\n      tax of this kind. Their wages are computed according to the common rate of\r\n      the district in which they reside; and, that they may be as little liable\r\n      as possible to any overcharge, their yearly gains are estimated at no more\r\n      than two hundred working days in the year. {Memoires concernant les\r\n      Droits, etc. tom. ii. p. 108.} The tax of each individual is varied from\r\n      year to year, according to different circumstances, of which the collector\r\n      or the commissary, whom intendant appoints to assist him, are the judges.\r\n      In Bohemia, in consequence of the alteration in the system of finances\r\n      which was begun in 1748, a very heavy tax is imposed upon the industry of\r\n      artificers. They are divided into four classes. The highest class pay a\r\n      hundred florins a year, which, at two-and-twenty pence half penny\r\n      a-florin, amounts to £9:7:6. The second class are taxed at seventy; the\r\n      third at fifty; and the fourth, comprehending artificers in villages, and\r\n      the lowest class of those in towns, at twenty-five florins. {Memoires\r\n      concernant les Droits, etc. tom. iii. p. 87.}\r\n\r\n      The recompence of ingenious artists, and of men of liberal professions, I\r\n      have endeavoured to show in the first book, necessarily keeps a certain\r\n      proportion to the emoluments of inferior trades. A tax upon this\r\n      recompence, therefore, could have no other effect than to raise it\r\n      somewhat higher than in proportion to the tax. If it did not rise in this\r\n      manner, the ingenious arts and the liberal professions, being no longer\r\n      upon a level with other trades, would be so much deserted, that they would\r\n      soon return to that level.\r\n\r\n      The emoluments of offices are not, like those of trades and professions,\r\n      regulated by the free competition of the market, and do not, therefore,\r\n      always bear a just proportion to what the nature of the employment\r\n      requires. They are, perhaps, in most countries, higher than it requires;\r\n      the persons who have the administration of government being generally\r\n      disposed to regard both themselves and their immediate dependents, rather\r\n      more than enough. The emoluments of offices, therefore, can, in most\r\n      cases, very well bear to be taxed. The persons, besides, who enjoy public\r\n      offices, especially the more lucrative, are, in all countries, the objects\r\n      of general envy; and a tax upon their emoluments, even though it should be\r\n      somewhat higher than upon any other sort of revenue, is always a very\r\n      popular tax. In England, for example, when, by the land-tax, every other\r\n      sort of revenue was supposed to be assessed at four shillings in the\r\n      pound, it was very popular to lay a real tax of five shillings and\r\n      sixpence in the pound upon the salaries of offices which exceeded a\r\n      hundred pounds a-year; the pensions of the younger branches of the royal\r\n      family, the pay of the officers of the army and navy, and a few others\r\n      less obnoxious to envy, excepted. There are in England no other direct\r\n      taxes upon the wages of labour.\r\n\r\n      ARTICLE IV.—Taxes which it is intended should fall indifferently\r\n      upon every different Species of Revenue.\r\n\r\n      The taxes which it is intended should fall indifferently upon every\r\n      different species of revenue, are capitation taxes, and taxes upon\r\n      consumable commodities. Those must be paid indifferently, from whatever\r\n      revenue the contributors may possess; from the rent of their land, from\r\n      the profits of their stock, or from the wages of their labour.\r\n\r\n      Capitation Taxes.\r\n\r\n      Capitation taxes, if it is attempted to proportion them to the fortune or\r\n      revenue of each contributor, become altogether arbitrary. The state of a\r\n      man’s fortune varies from day to day; and, without an inquisition, more\r\n      intolerable than any tax, and renewed at least once every year, can only\r\n      be guessed at. His assessment, therefore, must, in most cases, depend upon\r\n      the good or bad humour of his assessors, and must, therefore, be\r\n      altogether arbitrary and uncertain.\r\n\r\n      Capitation taxes, if they are proportioned, not to the supposed fortune,\r\n      but to the rank of each contributor, become altogether unequal; the\r\n      degrees of fortune being frequently unequal in the same degree of rank.\r\n\r\n      Such taxes, therefore, if it is attempted to render them equal, become\r\n      altogether arbitrary and uncertain; and if it is attempted to render them\r\n      certain and not arbitrary, become altogether unequal. Let the tax be light\r\n      or heavy, uncertainty is always a great grievance. In a light tax, a\r\n      considerable degree of inequality may be supported; in a heavy one, it is\r\n      altogether intolerable.\r\n\r\n      In the different poll-taxes which took place in England during the reign\r\n      of William III. the contributors were, the greater part of them, assessed\r\n      according to the degree of their rank; as dukes, marquises, earls,\r\n      viscounts, barons, esquires, gentlemen, the eldest and youngest sons of\r\n      peers, etc. All shop-keepers and tradesmen worth more than three hundred\r\n      pounds, that is, the better sort of them, were subject to the same\r\n      assessment, how great soever might be the difference in their fortunes.\r\n      Their rank was more considered than their fortune. Several of those who,\r\n      in the first poll-tax, were rated according to their supposed fortune were\r\n      afterwards rated according to their rank. Serjeants, attorneys, and\r\n      proctors at law, who, in the first poll-tax, were assessed at three\r\n      shillings in the pound of their supposed income, were afterwards assessed\r\n      as gentlemen. In the assessment of a tax which was not very heavy, a\r\n      considerable degree of inequality had been found less insupportable than\r\n      any degree of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n      In the capitation which has been levied in France, without-any\r\n      interruption, since the beginning of the present century, the highest\r\n      orders of people are rated according to their rank, by an invariable\r\n      tariff; the lower orders of people, according to what is supposed to be\r\n      their fortune, by an assessment which varies from year to year. The\r\n      officers of the king’s court, the judges, and other officers in the\r\n      superior courts of justice, the officers of the troops, etc are assessed\r\n      in the first manner. The inferior ranks of people in the provinces are\r\n      assessed in the second. In France, the great easily submit to a\r\n      considerable degree of inequality in a tax which, so far as it affects\r\n      them, is not a very heavy one; but could not brook the arbitrary\r\n      assessment of an intendant.\r\n\r\n      The inferior ranks of people must, in that country, suffer patiently the\r\n      usage which their superiors think proper to give them.\r\n\r\n      In England, the different poll-taxes never produced the sum which had been\r\n      expected from them, or which it was supposed they might have produced, had\r\n      they been exactly levied. In France, the capitation always produces the\r\n      sum expected from it. The mild government of England, when it assessed the\r\n      different ranks of people to the poll-tax, contented itself with what that\r\n      assessment happened to produce, and required no compensation for the loss\r\n      which the state might sustain, either by those who could not pay, or by\r\n      those who would not pay (for there were many such), and who, by the\r\n      indulgent execution of the law, were not forced to pay. The more severe\r\n      government of France assesses upon each generality a certain sum, which\r\n      the intendant must find as he can. If any province complains of being\r\n      assessed too high, it may, in the assessment of next year, obtain an\r\n      abatement proportioned to the overcharge of the year before; but it must\r\n      pay in the mean time. The intendant, in order to be sure of finding the\r\n      sum assessed upon his generality, was empowered to assess it in a larger\r\n      sum, that the failure or inability of some of the contributors might be\r\n      compensated by the overcharge of the rest; and till 1765, the fixation of\r\n      this surplus assessment was left altogether to his discretion. In that\r\n      year, indeed, the council assumed this power to itself. In the capitation\r\n      of the provinces, it is observed by the perfectly well informed author of\r\n      the Memoirs upon the Impositions in France, the proportion which falls\r\n      upon the nobility, and upon those whose privileges exempt them from the\r\n      taille, is the least considerable. The largest falls upon those subject to\r\n      the taille, who are assessed to the capitation at so much a-pound of what\r\n      they pay to that other tax. Capitation taxes, so far as they are levied\r\n      upon the lower ranks of people, are direct taxes upon the wages of labour,\r\n      and are attended with all the inconveniencies of such taxes.\r\n\r\n      Capitation taxes are levied at little expense; and, where they are\r\n      rigorously exacted, afford a very sure revenue to the state. It is upon\r\n      this account that, in countries where the case, comfort, and security of\r\n      the inferior ranks of people are little attended to, capitation taxes are\r\n      very common. It is in general, however, but a small part of the public\r\n      revenue, which, in a great empire, has ever been drawn from such taxes;\r\n      and the greatest sum which they have ever afforded, might always have been\r\n      found in some other way much more convenient to the people.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon Consumable Commodities.\r\n\r\n      The impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their revenue, by\r\n      any capitation, seems to have given occasion to the invention of taxes\r\n      upon consumable commodities. The state not knowing how to tax, directly\r\n      and proportionably, the revenue of its subjects, endeavours to tax it\r\n      indirectly by taxing their expense, which, it is supposed, will, in most\r\n      cases, be nearly in proportion to their revenue. Their expense is taxed,\r\n      by taxing the consumable commodities upon which it is laid out.\r\n\r\n      Consumable commodities are either necessaries or luxuries.\r\n\r\n      By necessaries I understand, not only the commodities which are\r\n      indispensibly necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom\r\n      of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the\r\n      lowest order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly\r\n      speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose,\r\n      very comfortably, though they had no linen. But in the present times,\r\n      through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be\r\n      ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would\r\n      be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty, which, it is\r\n      presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom,\r\n      in the same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in\r\n      England. The poorest creditable person, of either sex, would be ashamed to\r\n      appear in public without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a\r\n      necessary of life to the lowest order of men; but not to the same order of\r\n      women, who may, without any discredit, walk about barefooted. In France,\r\n      they are necessaries neither to men nor to women; the lowest rank of both\r\n      sexes appearing there publicly, without any discredit, sometimes in wooden\r\n      shoes, and sometimes barefooted. Under necessaries, therefore, I\r\n      comprehend, not only those things which nature, but those things which the\r\n      established rules of decency have rendered necessary to the lowest rank of\r\n      people. All other things I call luxuries, without meaning, by this\r\n      appellation, to throw the smallest degree of reproach upon the temperate\r\n      use of them. Beer and ale, for example, in Great Britain, and wine, even\r\n      in the wine countries, I call luxuries. A man of any rank may, without any\r\n      reproach, abstain totally from tasting such liquors. Nature does not\r\n      render them necessary for the support of life; and custom nowhere renders\r\n      it indecent to live without them.\r\n\r\n      As the wages of labour are everywhere regulated, partly by the demand for\r\n      it, and partly by the average price of the necessary articles of\r\n      subsistence; whatever raises this average price must necessarily raise\r\n      those wages; so that the labourer may still be able to purchase that\r\n      quantity of those necessary articles which the state of the demand for\r\n      labour, whether increasing, stationary, or declining, requires that he\r\n      should have. {See book i.chap. 8} A tax upon those articles necessarily\r\n      raises their price somewhat higher than the amount of the tax, because the\r\n      dealer, who advances the tax, must generally get it back, with a profit.\r\n      Such a tax must, therefore, occasion a rise in the wages of labour,\r\n      proportionable to this rise of price.\r\n\r\n      It is thus that a tax upon the necessaries of life operates exactly in the\r\n      same manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labour. The labourer, though\r\n      he may pay it out of his hand, cannot, for any considerable time at least,\r\n      be properly said even to advance it. It must always, in the long-run, be\r\n      advanced to him by his immediate employer, in the advanced state of wages.\r\n      His employer, if he is a manufacturer, will charge upon the price of his\r\n      goods the rise of wages, together with a profit, so that the final payment\r\n      of the tax, together with this overcharge, will fall upon the consumer. If\r\n      his employer is a farmer, the final payment, together with a like\r\n      overcharge, will fall upon the rent of the landlord.\r\n\r\n      It is otherwise with taxes upon what I call luxuries, even upon those of\r\n      the poor. The rise in the price of the taxed commodities, will not\r\n      necessarily occasion any rise in the wages of labour. A tax upon tobacco,\r\n      for example, though a luxury of the poor, as well as of the rich, will not\r\n      raise wages. Though it is taxed in England at three times, and in France\r\n      at fifteen times its original price, those high duties seem to have no\r\n      effect upon the wages of labour. The same thing maybe said of the taxes\r\n      upon tea and sugar, which, in England and Holland, have become luxuries of\r\n      the lowest ranks of people; and of those upon chocolate, which, in Spain,\r\n      is said to have become so.\r\n\r\n      The different taxes which, in Great Britain, have, in the course of the\r\n      present century, been imposed upon spiritous liquors, are not supposed to\r\n      have had any effect upon the wages of labour. The rise in the price of\r\n      porter, occasioned by an additional tax of three shillings upon the barrel\r\n      of strong beer, has not raised the wages of common labour in London. These\r\n      were about eighteen pence or twenty pence a-day before the tax, and they\r\n      are not more now.\r\n\r\n      The high price of such commodities does not necessarily diminish the\r\n      ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families. Upon the\r\n      sober and industrious poor, taxes upon such commodities act as sumptuary\r\n      laws, and dispose them either to moderate, or to refrain altogether from\r\n      the use of superfluities which they can no longer easily afford. Their\r\n      ability to bring up families, in consequence of this forced frugality,\r\n      instead of being diminished, is frequently, perhaps, increased by the tax.\r\n      It is the sober and industrious poor who generally bring up the most\r\n      numerous families, and who principally supply the demand for useful\r\n      labour. All the poor, indeed, are not sober and industrious; and the\r\n      dissolute and disorderly might continue to indulge themselves in the use\r\n      of such commodities, after this rise of price, in the same manner as\r\n      before, without regarding the distress which this indulgence might bring\r\n      upon their families. Such disorderly persons, however, seldom rear up\r\n      numerous families, their children generally perishing from neglect,\r\n      mismanagement, and the scantiness or unwholesomeness of their food. If by\r\n      the strength of their constitution, they survive the hardships to which\r\n      the bad conduct of their parents exposes them, yet the example of that bad\r\n      conduct commonly corrupts their morals; so that, instead of being useful\r\n      to society by their industry, they become public nuisances by their vices\r\n      and disorders. Through the advanced price of the luxuries of the poor,\r\n      therefore, might increase somewhat the distress of such disorderly\r\n      families, and thereby diminish somewhat their ability to bring up\r\n      children, it would not probably diminish much the useful population of the\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      Any rise in the average price of necessaries, unless it be compensated by\r\n      a proportionable rise in the wages of labour, must necessarily diminish,\r\n      more or less, the ability of the poor to bring up numerous families, and,\r\n      consequently, to supply the demand for useful labour; whatever may be the\r\n      state of that demand, whether increasing, stationary, or declining; or\r\n      such as requires an increasing, stationary, or declining population.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon luxuries have no tendency to raise the price of any other\r\n      commodities, except that of the commodities taxed. Taxes upon necessaries,\r\n      by raising the wages of labour, necessarily tend to raise the price of all\r\n      manufactures, and consequently to diminish the extent of their sale and\r\n      consumption. Taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by the consumers of the\r\n      commodities taxed, without any retribution. They fall indifferently upon\r\n      every species of revenue, the wages of labour, the profits of stock, and\r\n      the rent of land. Taxes upon necessaries, so far as they affect the\r\n      labouring poor, are finally paid, partly by landlords, in the diminished\r\n      rent of their lands, and partly by rich consumers, whether landlords or\r\n      others, in the advanced price of manufactured goods; and always with a\r\n      considerable overcharge. The advanced price of such manufactures as are\r\n      real necessaries of life, and are destined for the consumption of the\r\n      poor, of coarse woollens, for example, must be compensated to the poor by\r\n      a farther advancement of their wages. The middling and superior ranks of\r\n      people, if they understood their own interest, ought always to oppose all\r\n      taxes upon the necessaries of life, as well as all taxes upon the wages of\r\n      labour. The final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether\r\n      upon themselves, and always with a considerable overcharge. They fall\r\n      heaviest upon the landlords, who always pay in a double capacity; in that\r\n      of landlords, by the reduction, of their rent; and in that of rich\r\n      consumers, by the increase of their expense. The observation of Sir\r\n      Matthew Decker, that certain taxes are, in the price of certain goods,\r\n      sometimes repeated and accumulated four or five times, is perfectly just\r\n      with regard to taxes upon the necessaries of life. In the price of\r\n      leather, for example, you must pay not only for the tax upon the leather\r\n      of your own shoes, but for a part of that upon those of the shoemaker and\r\n      the tanner. You must pay, too, for the tax upon the salt, upon the soap,\r\n      and upon the candles which those workmen consume while employed in your\r\n      service; and for the tax upon the leather, which the saltmaker, the\r\n      soap-maker, and the candle-maker consume, while employed in their service.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, the principal taxes upon the necessaries of life, are\r\n      those upon the four commodities just now mentioned, salt, leather, soap,\r\n      and candles.\r\n\r\n      Salt is a very ancient and a very universal subject of taxation. It was\r\n      taxed among the Romans, and it is so at present in, I believe, every part\r\n      of Europe. The quantity annually consumed by any individual is so small,\r\n      and may be purchased so gradually, that nobody, it seems to have been\r\n      thought, could feel very sensibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it. It is\r\n      in England taxed at three shillings and fourpence a bushel; about three\r\n      times the original price of the commodity. In some other countries, the\r\n      tax is still higher. Leather is a real necessary of life. The use of linen\r\n      renders soap such. In countries where the winter nights are long, candles\r\n      are a necessary instrument of trade. Leather and soap are in Great Britain\r\n      taxed at three halfpence a-pound; candles at a penny; taxes which, upon\r\n      the original price of leather, may amount to about eight or ten per cent.;\r\n      upon that of soap, to about twenty or five-and-twenty per cent.; and upon\r\n      that of candles to about fourteen or fifteen per cent.; taxes which,\r\n      though lighter than that upon salt, are still very heavy. As all those\r\n      four commodities are real necessaries of life, such heavy taxes upon them\r\n      must increase somewhat the expense of the sober and industrious poor, and\r\n      must consequently raise more or less the wages of their labour.\r\n\r\n      In a country where the winters are so cold as in Great Britain, fuel is,\r\n      during that season, in the strictest sense of the word, a necessary of\r\n      life, not only for the purpose of dressing victuals, but for the\r\n      comfortable subsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work within\r\n      doors; and coals are the cheapest of all fuel. The price of fuel has so\r\n      important an influence upon that of labour, that all over Great Britain,\r\n      manufactures have confined themselves principally to the coal counties;\r\n      other parts of the country, on account of the high price of this necessary\r\n      article, not being able to work so cheap. In some manufactures, besides,\r\n      coal is a necessary instrument of trade; as in those of glass, iron, and\r\n      all other metals. If a bounty could in any case be reasonable, it might\r\n      perhaps be so upon the transportation of coals from those parts of the\r\n      country in which they abound, to those in which they are wanted. But the\r\n      legislature, instead of a bounty, has imposed a tax of three shillings and\r\n      threepence a-ton upon coals carried coastways; which, upon most sorts of\r\n      coal, is more than sixty per cent. of the original price at the coal pit.\r\n      Coals carried, either by land or by inland navigation, pay no duty. Where\r\n      they are naturally cheap, they are consumed duty free; where they are\r\n      naturally dear, they are loaded with a heavy duty.\r\n\r\n      Such taxes, though they raise the price of subsistence, and consequently\r\n      the wages of labour, yet they afford a considerable revenue to government,\r\n      which it might not be easy to find in any other way. There may, therefore,\r\n      be good reasons for continuing them. The bounty upon the exportation of\r\n      corn, so far as it tends, in the actual state of tillage, to raise the\r\n      price of that necessary article, produces all the like bad effects; and\r\n      instead of affording any revenue, frequently occasions a very great\r\n      expense to government. The high duties upon the importation of foreign\r\n      corn, which, in years of moderate plenty, amount to a prohibition; and the\r\n      absolute prohibition of the importation, either of live cattle, or of salt\r\n      provisions, which takes place in the ordinary state of the law, and which,\r\n      on account of the scarcity, is at present suspended for a limited time\r\n      with regard to Ireland and the British plantations, have all had the bad\r\n      effects of taxes upon the necessaries of life, and produce no revenue to\r\n      government. Nothing seems necessary for the repeal of such regulations,\r\n      but to convince the public of the futility of that system in consequence\r\n      of which they have been established.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon the necessaries of life are much higher in many other countries\r\n      than in Great Britain. Duties upon flour and meal when ground at the mill,\r\n      and upon bread when baked at the oven, take place in many countries. In\r\n      Holland the money-price of the bread consumed in towns is supposed to be\r\n      doubled by means of such taxes. In lieu of a part of them, the people who\r\n      live in the country, pay every year so much a-head, according to the sort\r\n      of bread they are supposed to consume. Those who consume wheaten bread pay\r\n      three guilders fifteen stivers; about six shillings and ninepence\r\n      halfpenny. Those, and some other taxes of the same kind, by raising the\r\n      price of labour, are said to have ruined the greater part of the\r\n      manufactures of Holland {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. p. 210,\r\n      211.}. Similar taxes, though not quite so heavy, take place in the\r\n      Milanese, in the states of Genoa, in the duchy of Modena, in the duchies\r\n      of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, and the Ecclesiastical state. A French\r\n      author {Le Reformateur} of some note, has proposed to reform the finances\r\n      of his country, by substituting in the room of the greater part of other\r\n      taxes, this most ruinous of all taxes. There is nothing so absurd, says\r\n      Cicero, which has not sometimes been asserted by some philosophers.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon butcher’s meat are still more common than those upon bread. It\r\n      may indeed be doubted, whether butcher’s meat is any where a necessary of\r\n      life. Grain and other vegetables, with the help of milk, cheese, and\r\n      butter, or oil, where butter is not to be had, it is known from\r\n      experience, can, without any butcher’s meat, afford the most plentiful,\r\n      the most wholesome, the most nourishing, and the most invigorating diet.\r\n      Decency nowhere requires that any man should eat butcher’s meat, as it in\r\n      most places requires that he should wear a linen shirt or a pair of\r\n      leather shoes.\r\n\r\n      Consumable commodities, whether necessaries or luxuries, may be taxed in\r\n      two different ways. The consumer may either pay an annual sum on account\r\n      of his using or consuming goods of a certain kind; or the goods may be\r\n      taxed while they remain in the hands of the dealer, and before they are\r\n      delivered to the consumer. The consumable goods which last a considerable\r\n      time before they are consumed altogether, are most properly taxed in the\r\n      one way; those of which the consumption is either immediate or more\r\n      speedy, in the other. The coach-tax and plate tax are examples of the\r\n      former method of imposing; the greater part of the other duties of excise\r\n      and customs, of the latter.\r\n\r\n      A coach may, with good management, last ten or twelve years. It might be\r\n      taxed, once for all, before it comes out of the hands of the coach-maker.\r\n      But it is certainly more convenient for the buyer to pay four pounds\r\n      a-year for the privilege of keeping a coach, than to pay all at once forty\r\n      or forty-eight pounds additional price to the coach-maker; or a sum\r\n      equivalent to what the tax is likely to cost him during the time he uses\r\n      the same coach. A service of plate in the same manner, may last more than\r\n      a century. It is certainly-easier for the consumer to pay five shillings\r\n      a-year for every hundred ounces of plate, near one per cent. of the value,\r\n      than to redeem this long annuity at five-and-twenty or thirty years\r\n      purchase, which would enhance the price at least five-and-twenty or thirty\r\n      per cent. The different taxes which affect houses, are certainly more\r\n      conveniently paid by moderate annual payments, than by a heavy tax of\r\n      equal value upon the first building or sale of the house.\r\n\r\n      It was the well-known proposal of Sir Matthew Decker, that all\r\n      commodities, even those of which the consumption is either immediate or\r\n      speedy, should be taxed in this manner; the dealer advancing nothing, but\r\n      the consumer paying a certain annual sum for the licence to consume\r\n      certain goods. The object of his scheme was to promote all the different\r\n      branches of foreign trade, particularly the carrying trade, by taking away\r\n      all duties upon importation and exportation, and thereby enabling the\r\n      merchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purchase of goods\r\n      and the freight of ships, no part of either being diverted towards the\r\n      advancing of taxes, The project, however, of taxing, in this manner, goods\r\n      of immediate or speedy consumption, seems liable to the four following\r\n      very important objections. First, the tax would be more unequal, or not so\r\n      well proportioned to the expense and consumption of the different\r\n      contributors, as in the way in which it is commonly imposed. The taxes\r\n      upon ale, wine, and spiritous liquors, which are advanced by the dealers,\r\n      are finally paid by the different consumers, exactly in proportion to\r\n      their respective consumption. But if the tax were to be paid by purchasing\r\n      a licence to drink those liquors, the sober would, in proportion to his\r\n      consumption, be taxed much more heavily than the drunken consumer. A\r\n      family which exercised great hospitality, would be taxed much more lightly\r\n      than one who entertained fewer guests. Secondly, this mode of taxation, by\r\n      paying for an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly licence to consume certain\r\n      goods, would diminish very much one of the principal conveniences of taxes\r\n      upon goods of speedy consumption; the piece-meal payment. In the price of\r\n      threepence halfpenny, which is at present paid for a pot of porter, the\r\n      different taxes upon malt, hops, and beer, together with the extraordinary\r\n      profit which the brewer charges for having advanced than, may perhaps\r\n      amount to about three halfpence. If a workman can conveniently spare those\r\n      three halfpence, he buys a pot of porter. If he cannot, he contents\r\n      himself with a pint; and, as a penny saved is a penny got, he thus gains a\r\n      farthing by his temperance. He pays the tax piece-meal, as he can afford\r\n      to pay it, and when he can afford to pay it, and every act of payment is\r\n      perfectly voluntary, and what he can avoid if he chuses to do so. Thirdly,\r\n      such taxes would operate less as sumptuary laws. When the licence was once\r\n      purchased, whether the purchaser drunk much or drunk little, his tax would\r\n      be the same. Fourthly, if a workman were to pay all at once, by yearly,\r\n      half-yearly, or quarterly payments, a tax equal to what he at present\r\n      pays, with little or no inconveniency, upon all the different pots and\r\n      pints of porter which he drinks in any such period of time, the sum might\r\n      frequently distress him very much. This mode of taxation, therefore, it\r\n      seems evident, could never, without the most grievous oppression, produce\r\n      a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the present mode without\r\n      any oppression. In several countries, however, commodities of an immediate\r\n      or very speedy consumption are taxed in this manner. In Holland, people\r\n      pay so much a-head for a licence to drink tea. I have already mentioned a\r\n      tax upon bread, which, so far as it is consumed in farm houses and country\r\n      villages, is there levied in the same manner.\r\n\r\n      The duties of excise are imposed chiefly upon goods of home produce,\r\n      destined for home consumption. They are imposed only upon a few sorts of\r\n      goods of the most general use. There can never be any doubt, either\r\n      concerning the goods which are subject to those duties, or concerning the\r\n      particular duty which each species of goods is subject to. They fall\r\n      almost altogether upon what I call luxuries, excepting always the four\r\n      duties above mentioned, upon salt, soap, leather, candles, and perhaps\r\n      that upon green glass.\r\n\r\n      The duties of customs are much more ancient than those of excise. They\r\n      seem to have been called customs, as denoting customary payments, which\r\n      had been in use for time immemorial. They appear to have been originally\r\n      considered as taxes upon the profits of merchants. During the barbarous\r\n      times of feudal anarchy, merchants, like all the other inhabitants of\r\n      burghs, were considered as little better than emancipated bondmen, whose\r\n      persons were despised, and whose gains were envied. The great nobility,\r\n      who had consented that the king should tallage the profits of their own\r\n      tenants, were not unwilling that he should tallage likewise those of an\r\n      order of men whom it was much less their interest to protect. In those\r\n      ignorant times, it was not understood, that the profits of merchants are a\r\n      subject not taxable directly; or that the final payment of all such taxes\r\n      must fall, with a considerable overcharge, upon the consumers.\r\n\r\n      The gains of alien merchants were looked upon more unfavourably than those\r\n      of English merchants. It was natural, therefore, that those of the former\r\n      should be taxed more heavily than those of the latter. This distinction\r\n      between the duties upon aliens and those upon English merchants, which was\r\n      begun from ignorance, has been continued front the spirit of monopoly, or\r\n      in order to give our own merchants an advantage, both in the home and in\r\n      the foreign market.\r\n\r\n      With this distinction, the ancient duties of customs were imposed equally\r\n      upon all sorts of goods, necessaries as well its luxuries, goods exported\r\n      as well as goods imported. Why should the dealers in one sort of goods, it\r\n      seems to have been thought, be more favoured than those in another? or why\r\n      should the merchant exporter be more favoured than the merchant importer?\r\n\r\n      The ancient customs were divided into three branches. The first, and,\r\n      perhaps, the most ancient of all those duties, was that upon wool and\r\n      leather. It seems to have been chiefly or altogether an exportation duty.\r\n      When the woollen manufacture came to be established in England, lest the\r\n      king should lose any part of his customs upon wool by the exportation of\r\n      woollen cloths, a like duty was imposed upon them. The other two branches\r\n      were, first, a duty upon wine, which being imposed at so much a-ton, was\r\n      called a tonnage; and, secondly, a duty upon all other goods, which being\r\n      imposed at so much a-pound of their supposed value, was called a poundage.\r\n      In the forty-seventh year of Edward III., a duty of sixpence in the pound\r\n      was imposed upon all goods exported and imported, except wools,\r\n      wool-felts, leather, and wines which were subject to particular duties. In\r\n      the fourteenth of Richard II., this duty was raised to one shilling in the\r\n      pound; but, three years afterwards, it was again reduced to sixpence. It\r\n      was raised to eightpence in the second year of Henry IV.; and, in the\r\n      fourth of the same prince, to one shilling. From this time to the ninth\r\n      year of William III., this duty continued at one shilling in the pound.\r\n      The duties of tonnage and poundage were generally granted to the king by\r\n      one and the same act of parliament, and were called the subsidy of tonnage\r\n      and poundage. The subsidy of poundage having continued for so long a time\r\n      at one shilling in the pound, or at five per cent., a subsidy came, in the\r\n      language of the customs, to denote a general duty of this kind of five per\r\n      cent. This subsidy, which is now called the old subsidy, still continues\r\n      to be levied, according to the book of rates established by the twelfth of\r\n      Charles II. The method of ascertaining, by a book of rates, the value of\r\n      goods subject to this duty, is said to be older than the time of James I.\r\n      The new subsidy, imposed by the ninth and tenth of William III., was an\r\n      additional five per cent. upon the greater part of goods. The one-third\r\n      and the two-third subsidy made up between them another five per cent. of\r\n      which they were proportionable parts. The subsidy of 1747 made a fourth\r\n      five per cent. upon the greater part of goods; and that of 1759, a fifth\r\n      upon some particular sorts of goods. Besides those five subsidies, a great\r\n      variety of other duties have occasionally been imposed upon particular\r\n      sorts of goods, in order sometimes to relieve the exigencies of the\r\n      state, and sometimes to regulate the trade of the country, according to\r\n      the principles of the mercantile system.\r\n\r\n      That system has come gradually more and more into fashion. The old subsidy\r\n      was imposed indifferently upon exportation, as well as importation. The\r\n      four subsequent subsidies, as well as the other duties which have since\r\n      been occasionally imposed upon particular sorts of goods, have, with a few\r\n      exceptions, been laid altogether upon importation. The greater part of the\r\n      ancient duties which had been imposed upon the exportation of the goods of\r\n      home produce and manufacture, have either been lightened or taken away\r\n      altogether. In most cases, they have been taken away. Bounties have even\r\n      been given upon the exportation of some of them. Drawbacks, too, sometimes\r\n      of the whole, and, in most cases, of a part of the duties which are paid\r\n      upon the importation of foreign goods, have been granted upon their\r\n      exportation. Only half the duties imposed by the old subsidy upon\r\n      importation, are drawn back upon exportation; but the whole of those\r\n      imposed by the latter subsidies and other imposts are, upon the greater\r\n      parts of the goods, drawn back in the same manner. This growing favour of\r\n      exportation, and discouragement of importation, have suffered only a few\r\n      exceptions, which chiefly concern the materials of some manufactures.\r\n      These our merchants and manufacturers are willing should come as cheap as\r\n      possible to themselves, and as dear as possible to their rivals and\r\n      competitors in other countries. Foreign materials are, upon this account,\r\n      sometimes allowed to be imported duty-free; spanish wool, for example,\r\n      flax, and raw linen yarn. The exportation of the materials of home\r\n      produce, and of those which are the particular produce of our colonies,\r\n      has sometimes been prohibited, and sometimes subjected to higher duties.\r\n      The exportation of English wool has been prohibited. That of beaver skins,\r\n      of beaver wool, and of gum-senega, has been subjected to higher duties;\r\n      Great Britain, by the conquests of Canada and Senegal, having got almost\r\n      the monopoly of those commodities.\r\n\r\n      That the mercantile system has not been very favourable to the revenue of\r\n      the great body of the people, to the annual produce of the land and labour\r\n      of the country, I have endeavoured to show in the fourth book of this\r\n      Inquiry. It seems not to have been more favourable to the revenue of the\r\n      sovereign; so far, at least, as that revenue depends upon the duties of\r\n      customs.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of that system, the importation of several sorts of goods\r\n      has been prohibited altogether. This prohibition has, in some cases,\r\n      entirely prevented, and in others has very much diminished, the\r\n      importation of those commodities, by reducing the importers to the\r\n      necessity of smuggling. It has entirely prevented the importation of\r\n      foreign wollens; and it has very much diminished that of foreign silks and\r\n      velvets, In both cases, it has entirely annihilated the revenue of customs\r\n      which might have been levied upon such importation.\r\n\r\n      The high duties which have been imposed upon the importation of many\r\n      different sorts of foreign goods in order to discourage their consumption\r\n      in Great Britain, have, in many cases, served only to encourage smuggling,\r\n      and, in all cases, have reduced the revenues of the customs below what\r\n      more moderate duties would have afforded. The saying of Dr Swift, that in\r\n      the arithmetic of the customs, two and two, instead of making four, make\r\n      sometimes only one, holds perfectly true with regard to such heavy duties,\r\n      which never could have been imposed, had not the mercantile system taught\r\n      us, in many cases, to employ taxation as an instrument, not of revenue,\r\n      but of monopoly.\r\n\r\n      The bounties which are sometimes given upon the exportation of home\r\n      produce and manufactures, and the drawbacks which are paid upon the\r\n      re-exportation of the greater part of foreign goods, have given occasion\r\n      to many frauds, and to a species of smuggling, more destructive of the\r\n      public revenue than any other. In order to obtain the bounty or drawback,\r\n      the goods, it is well known, are sometimes shipped, and sent to sea, but\r\n      soon afterwards clandestinely re-landed in some other part of the country.\r\n      The defalcation of the revenue of customs occasioned by bounties and\r\n      drawbacks, of which a great part are obtained fraudulently, is very great.\r\n      The gross produce of the customs, in the year which ended on the 5th of\r\n      January 1755, amounted to £5,068,000. The bounties which were paid out of\r\n      this revenue, though in that year there was no bounty upon corn, amounted\r\n      to £167,806. The drawbacks which were paid upon debentures and\r\n      certificates, to £2,156,800. Bounties and drawbacks together amounted to\r\n      £2,324,600. In consequence of these deductions, the revenue of the customs\r\n      amounted only to £2,743,400; from which deducting £287,900 for the expense\r\n      of management, in salaries and other incidents, the neat revenue of the\r\n      customs for that year comes out to be £2,455,500. The expense of\r\n      management, amounts, in this manner, to between five and six per cent.\r\n      upon the gross revenue of the customs; and to something more than ten per\r\n      cent. upon what remains of that revenue, after deducting what is paid away\r\n      in bounties and drawbacks.\r\n\r\n      Heavy duties being imposed upon almost all goods imported, our merchant\r\n      importers smuggle as much, and make entry of as little as they can. Our\r\n      merchant exporters, on the contrary, make entry of more than they export;\r\n      sometimes out of vanity, and to pass for great dealers in goods which pay\r\n      no duty gain a bounty back. Our exports, in consequence of these different\r\n      frauds, appear upon the custom-house books greatly to overbalance our\r\n      imports, to the unspeakable comfort of those politicians, who measure the\r\n      national prosperity by what they call the balance of trade.\r\n\r\n      All goods imported, unless particularly exempted, and such exemptions are\r\n      not very numerous, are liable to some duties of customs. If any goods are\r\n      imported, not mentioned in the book of rates, they are taxed at 4s:9¾d.\r\n      for every twenty shillings value, according to the oath of the importer,\r\n      that is, nearly at five subsidies, or five poundage duties. The book of\r\n      rates is extremely comprehensive, and enumerates a great variety of\r\n      articles, many of them little used, and, therefore, not well known. It is,\r\n      upon this account, frequently uncertain under what article a particular\r\n      sort of goods ought to be classed, and, consequently what duty they ought\r\n      to pay. Mistakes with regard to this sometimes ruin the custom-house\r\n      officer, and frequently occasion much trouble, expense, and vexation to\r\n      the importer. In point of perspicuity, precision, and distinctness,\r\n      therefore, the duties of customs are much inferior to those of excise.\r\n\r\n      In order that the greater part of the members of any society should\r\n      contribute to the public revenue, in proportion to their respective\r\n      expense, it does not seem necessary that every single article of that\r\n      expense should be taxed. The revenue which is levied by the duties of\r\n      excise is supposed to fall as equally upon the contributors as that which\r\n      is levied by the duties of customs; and the duties of excise are imposed\r\n      upon a few articles only of the most general used and consumption. It has\r\n      been the opinion of many people, that, by proper management, the duties of\r\n      customs might likewise, without any loss to the public revenue, and with\r\n      great advantage to foreign trade, be confined to a few articles only.\r\n\r\n      The foreign articles, of the most general use and consumption in Great\r\n      Britain, seem at present to consist chiefly in foreign wines and brandies;\r\n      in some of the productions of America and the West Indies, sugar, rum,\r\n      tobacco, cocoa-nuts, etc. and in some of those of the East Indies, tea,\r\n      coffee, china-ware, spiceries of all kinds, several sorts of piece-goods,\r\n      etc. These different articles afford, the greater part of the perhaps, at\r\n      present, revenue which is drawn from the duties of customs. The taxes\r\n      which at present subsist upon foreign manufactures, if you except those\r\n      upon the few contained in the foregoing enumeration, have, the greater\r\n      part of them, been imposed for the purpose, not of revenue, but of\r\n      monopoly, or to give our own merchants an advantage in the home market. By\r\n      removing all prohibitions, and by subjecting all foreign manufactures to\r\n      such moderate taxes, as it was found from experience, afforded upon each\r\n      article the greatest revenue to the public, our own workmen might still\r\n      have a considerable advantage in the home market; and many articles, some\r\n      of which at present afford no revenue to government, and others a very\r\n      inconsiderable one, might afford a very great one.\r\n\r\n      High taxes, sometimes by diminishing the consumption of the taxed\r\n      commodities, and sometimes by encouraging smuggling frequently afford a\r\n      smaller revenue to government than what might be drawn from more moderate\r\n      taxes.\r\n\r\n      When the diminution of revenue is the effect of the diminution of\r\n      consumption, there can be but one remedy, and that is the lowering of the\r\n      tax. When the diminution of revenue is the effect of the encouragement\r\n      given to smuggling, it may, perhaps, be remedied in two ways; either by\r\n      diminishing the temptation to smuggle, or by increasing the difficulty of\r\n      smuggling. The temptation to smuggle can be diminished only by the\r\n      lowering of the tax; and the difficulty of smuggling can be increased only\r\n      by establishing that system of administration which is most proper for\r\n      preventing it.\r\n\r\n      The excise laws, it appears, I believe, from experience, obstruct and\r\n      embarrass the operations of the smuggler much more effectually than those\r\n      of the customs. By introducing into the customs a system of administration\r\n      as similar to that of the excise as the nature of the different duties\r\n      will admit, the difficulty of smuggling might be very much increased. This\r\n      alteration, it has been supposed by many people, might very easily be\r\n      brought about.\r\n\r\n      The importer of commodities liable to any duties of customs, it has been\r\n      said, might, at his option, be allowed either to carry them to his own\r\n      private warehouse; or to lodge them in a warehouse, provided either at his\r\n      own expense or at that of the public, but under the key of the\r\n      custom-house officer, and never to be opened but in his presence. If the\r\n      merchant carried them to his own private warehouse, the duties to be\r\n      immediately paid, and never afterwards to be drawn back; and that\r\n      warehouse to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the\r\n      custom-house officer, in order to ascertain how far the quantity contained\r\n      in it corresponded with that for which the duty had been paid. If he\r\n      carried them to the public warehouse, no duty to be paid till they were\r\n      taken out for home consumption. If taken out for exportation, to be\r\n      duty-free; proper security being always given that they should be so\r\n      exported. The dealers in those particular commodities, either by wholesale\r\n      or retail, to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the\r\n      custom-house officer; and to be obliged to justify, by proper\r\n      certificates, the payment of the duty upon the whole quantity contained in\r\n      their shops or warehouses. What are called the excise duties upon rum\r\n      imported, are at present levied in this manner; and the same system of\r\n      administration might, perhaps, be extended to all duties upon goods\r\n      imported; provided always that those duties were, like the duties of\r\n      excise, confined to a few sorts of goods of the most general use and\r\n      consumption. If they were extended to almost all sorts of goods, as at\r\n      present, public warehouses of sufficient extent could not easily be\r\n      provided; and goods of a very delicate nature, or of which the\r\n      preservation required much care and attention, could not safely be trusted\r\n      by the merchant in any warehouse but his own.\r\n\r\n      If, by such a system of administration, smuggling to any considerable\r\n      extent could be prevented, even under pretty high duties; and if every\r\n      duty was occasionally either heightened or lowered according as it was\r\n      most likely, either the one way or the other, to afford the greatest\r\n      revenue to the state; taxation being always employed as an instrument of\r\n      revenue, and never of monopoly; it seems not improbable that a revenue, at\r\n      least equal to the present neat revenue of the customs, might be drawn\r\n      from duties upon the importation of only a few sorts of goods of the most\r\n      general use and consumption; and that the duties of customs might thus be\r\n      brought to the same degree of simplicity, certainty, and precision, as\r\n      those of excise. What the revenue at present loses by drawbacks upon the\r\n      re-exportation of foreign goods, which are afterwards re-landed and\r\n      consumed at home, would, under this system, be saved altogether. If to\r\n      this saving, which would alone be very considerable, were added the\r\n      abolition of all bounties upon the exportation of home produce; in all\r\n      cases in which those bounties were not in reality drawbacks of some duties\r\n      of excise which had before been advanced; it cannot well be doubted, but\r\n      that the neat revenue of customs might, after an alteration of this kind,\r\n      be fully equal to what it had ever been before.\r\n\r\n      If, by such a change of system, the public revenue suffered no loss, the\r\n      trade and manufactures of the country would certainly gain a very\r\n      considerable advantage. The trade in the commodities not taxed, by far the\r\n      greatest number would be perfectly free, and might be carried on to and\r\n      from all parts of the world with every possible advantage. Among those\r\n      commodities would be comprehended all the necessaries of life, and all the\r\n      materials of manufacture. So far as the free importation of the\r\n      necessaries of life reduced their average money price in the home market,\r\n      it would reduce the money price of labour, but without reducing in any\r\n      respect its real recompence. The value of money is in proportion to the\r\n      quantity of the necessaries of life which it will purchase. That of the\r\n      necessaries of life is altogether independent of the quantity of money\r\n      which can be had for them. The reduction in the money price of labour\r\n      would necessarily be attended with a proportionable one in that of all\r\n      home manufactures, which would thereby gain some advantage in all foreign\r\n      markets. The price of some manufactures would be reduced, in a still\r\n      greater proportion, by the free importation of the raw materials. If raw\r\n      silk could be imported from China and Indostan, duty-free, the silk\r\n      manufacturers in England could greatly undersell those of both France and\r\n      Italy. There would be no occasion to prohibit the importation of foreign\r\n      silks and velvets. The cheapness of their goods would secure to our own\r\n      workmen, not only the possession of a home, but a very great command of\r\n      the foreign market. Even the trade in the commodities taxed, would be\r\n      carried on with much more advantage than at present. If those commodities\r\n      were delivered out of the public warehouse for foreign exportation, being\r\n      in this case exempted from all taxes, the trade in them would be perfectly\r\n      free. The carrying trade, in all sorts of goods, would, under this system,\r\n      enjoy every possible advantage. If these commodities were delivered out\r\n      for home consumption, the importer not being obliged to advance the tax\r\n      till he had an opportunity of selling his goods, either to some dealer, or\r\n      to some consumer, he could always afford to sell them cheaper than if he\r\n      had been obliged to advance it at the moment of importation. Under the\r\n      same taxes, the foreign trade of consumption, even in the taxed\r\n      commodities, might in this manner be carried on with much more advantage\r\n      than it is at present.\r\n\r\n      It was the object of the famous excise scheme of Sir Robert Walpole, to\r\n      establish, with regard to wine and tobacco, a system not very unlike that\r\n      which is here proposed. But though the bill which was then brought into\r\n      Parliament, comprehended those two commodities only, it was generally\r\n      supposed to be meant as an introduction to a more extensive scheme of the\r\n      same kind. Faction, combined with the interest of smuggling merchants,\r\n      raised so violent, though so unjust a clamour, against that bill, that the\r\n      minister thought proper to drop it; and, from a dread of exciting a\r\n      clamour of the same kind, none of his successors have dared to resume the\r\n      project.\r\n\r\n      The duties upon foreign luxuries, imported for home consumption, though\r\n      they sometimes fall upon the poor, fall principally upon people of\r\n      middling or more than middling fortune. Such are, for example, the duties\r\n      upon foreign wines, upon coffee, chocolate, tea, sugar, etc.\r\n\r\n      The duties upon the cheaper luxuries of home produce, destined for home\r\n      consumption, fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks, in proportion\r\n      to their respective expense. The poor pay the duties upon malt, hops,\r\n      beer, and ale, upon their own consumption; the rich, upon both their own\r\n      consumption and that of their servants.\r\n\r\n      The whole consumption of the inferior ranks of people, or of those below\r\n      the middling rank, it must be observed, is, in every country, much\r\n      greater, not only in quantity, but in value, than that of the middling,\r\n      and of those above the middling rank. The whole expense of the inferior is\r\n      much greater titan that of the superior ranks. In the first place, almost\r\n      the whole capital of every country is annually distributed among the\r\n      inferior ranks of people, as the wages of productive labour. Secondly, a\r\n      great part of the revenue, arising from both the rent of land and the\r\n      profits of stock, is annually distributed among the same rank, in the\r\n      wages and maintenance of menial servants, and other unproductive\r\n      labourers. Thirdly, some part of the profits of stock belongs to the same\r\n      rank, as a revenue arising from the employment of their small capitals.\r\n      The amount of the profits annually made by small shopkeepers, tradesmen,\r\n      and retailers of all kinds, is everywhere very considerable, and makes a\r\n      very considerable portion of the annual produce. Fourthly and lastly, some\r\n      part even of the rent of land belongs to the same rank; a considerable\r\n      part to those who are somewhat below the middling rank, and a small part\r\n      even to the lowest rank; common labourers sometimes possessing in property\r\n      an acre or two of land. Though the expense of those inferior ranks of\r\n      people, therefore, taking them individually, is very small, yet the whole\r\n      mass of it, taking them collectively, amounts always to by much the\r\n      largest portion of the whole expense of the society; what remains of the\r\n      annual produce of the land and labour of the country, for the consumption\r\n      of the superior ranks, being always much less, not only in quantity, but\r\n      in value. The taxes upon expense, therefore, which fall chiefly upon that\r\n      of the superior ranks of people, upon the smaller portion of the annual\r\n      produce, are likely to be much less productive than either those which\r\n      fall indifferently upon the expense of all ranks, or even those which fall\r\n      chiefly upon that of the inferior ranks, than either those which fall\r\n      indifferently upon the whole annual produce, or those which fall chiefly\r\n      upon the larger portion of it. The excise upon the materials and\r\n      manufacture of home-made fermented and spirituous liquors, is,\r\n      accordingly, of all the different taxes upon expense, by far the most\r\n      productive; and this branch of the excise falls very much, perhaps\r\n      principally, upon the expense of the common people. In the year which\r\n      ended on the 5th of July 1775, the gross produce of this branch of the\r\n      excise amounted to £3,341,837:9:9.\r\n\r\n      It must always be remembered, however, that it is the luxuries, and not\r\n      the necessary expense of the inferior ranks of people, that ought ever to\r\n      be taxed. The final payment of any tax upon their necessary expense, would\r\n      fall altogether upon the superior ranks of people; upon the smaller\r\n      portion of the annual produce, and not upon the greater. Such a tax must,\r\n      in all cases, either raise the wages of labour, or lessen the demand for\r\n      it. It could not raise the wages of labour, without throwing the final\r\n      payment of the tax upon the superior ranks of people. It could not lessen\r\n      the demand for labour, without lessening the annual produce of the land\r\n      and labour of the country, the fund upon which all taxes must be finally\r\n      paid. Whatever might be the state to which a tax of this kind reduced the\r\n      demand for labour, it must always raise wages higher than they otherwise\r\n      would be in that state; and the final payment of this enhancement of wages\r\n      must, in all cases, fall upon the superior ranks of people.\r\n\r\n      Fermented liquors brewed, and spiritous liquors distilled, not for sale,\r\n      but for private use, are not in Great Britain liable to any duties of\r\n      excise. This exemption, of which the object is to save private families\r\n      from the odious visit and examination of the tax-gatherer, occasions the\r\n      burden of those duties to fall frequently much lighter upon the rich than\r\n      upon the poor. It is not, indeed, very common to distil for private use,\r\n      though it is done sometimes. But in the country, many middling and almost\r\n      all rich and great families, brew their own beer. Their strong beer,\r\n      therefore, costs them eight shillings a-barrel less than it costs the\r\n      common brewer, who must have his profit upon the tax, as well as upon all\r\n      the other expense which he advances. Such families, therefore, must drink\r\n      their beer at least nine or ten shillings a-barrel cheaper than any liquor\r\n      of the same quality can be drank by the common people, to whom it is\r\n      everywhere more convenient to buy their beer, by little and little, from\r\n      the brewery or the ale-house. Malt, in the same manner, that is made for\r\n      the use of a private family, is not liable to the visit or examination of\r\n      the tax-gatherer but, in this case the family must compound at seven\r\n      shillings and sixpence a-head for the tax. Seven shillings and sixpence\r\n      are equal to the excise upon ten bushels of malt; a quantity fully equal\r\n      to what all the different members of any sober family, men, women, and\r\n      children, are, at an average, likely to consume. But in rich and great\r\n      families, where country hospitality is much practised, the malt liquors\r\n      consumed by the members of the family make but a small part of the\r\n      consumption of the house. Either on account of this composition, however,\r\n      or for other reasons, it is not near so common to malt as to brew for\r\n      private use. It is difficult to imagine any equitable reason, why those\r\n      who either brew or distil for private use should not be subject to a\r\n      composition of the same kind.\r\n\r\n      A greater revenue than what is at present drawn from all the heavy taxes\r\n      upon malt, beer, and ale, might be raised, it has frequently been said, by\r\n      a much lighter tax upon malt; the opportunities of defrauding the revenue\r\n      being much greater in a brewery than in a malt-house; and those who brew\r\n      for private use being exempted from all duties or composition for duties,\r\n      which is not the case with those who malt for private use.\r\n\r\n      In the porter brewery of London, a quarter of malt is commonly brewed into\r\n      more than two barrels and a-half, sometimes into three barrels of porter.\r\n      The different taxes upon malt amount to six shillings a-quarter; those\r\n      upon strong ale and beer to eight shillings a-barrel. In the porter\r\n      brewery, therefore, the different taxes upon malt, beer, and ale, amount\r\n      to between twenty-six and thirty shillings upon the produce of a quarter\r\n      of malt. In the country brewery for common country sale, a quarter of malt\r\n      is seldom brewed into less than two barrels of strong, and one barrel of\r\n      small beer; frequently into two barrels and a-half of strong beer. The\r\n      different taxes upon small beer amount to one shilling and fourpence\r\n      a-barrel. In the country brewery, therefore, the different taxes upon\r\n      malt, beer, and ale, seldom amount to less than twenty-three shillings and\r\n      fourpence, frequently to twenty-six shillings, upon the produce of a\r\n      quarter of malt. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, therefore, the\r\n      whole amount of the duties upon malt, beer, and ale, cannot be estimated\r\n      at less than twenty-four or twenty-five shillings upon the produce of a\r\n      quarter of malt. But by taking off all the different duties upon beer and\r\n      ale, and by trebling the malt tax, or by raising it from six to eighteen\r\n      shillings upon the quarter of malt, a greater revenue, it is said, might\r\n      be raised by this single tax, than what is at present drawn from all those\r\n      heavier taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In 1772, the old malt tax produced.........  £722,023: 11: 11\r\n                             The additional... £356,776:  7:  9¾\r\n  In 1773, the old tax produced............... £561,627:  3:  7½\r\n                             The additional... £278,650: 15:  3¾\r\n  In 1774, the old tax  produced ............. £624,614: 17:  5¾\r\n                             The additional....£310,745:  2:  8½\r\n  In 1775, the old tax produced  ..............£657,357:  0:  8¼\r\n                             The additional....£323,785: 12:  6¼\r\n                                           4)£3,835,580: 12:  0¾\r\n  Average of these four years ...............  £958,895:  3:  0\r\n\r\n  In 1772, the country excise produced.......£1,243,120:  5:  3\r\n                    The London brewery          408,260:  7:  2¾\r\n  In 1773, the country excise................£1,245,808:  3:  3\r\n                    The London brewery          405,406: 17: 10½\r\n  In 1774, the country excise................£1,246,373: 14:  5½\r\n                    The London brewery          320,601: 18:  0¼\r\n  In 1775, the country excise................£1,214,583:  6:  1¼\r\n                    The London brewery          463,670:  7:  0¼\r\n                                           4)£6,547,832 19:  2¼\r\n  Average of these four years ...............£1,636,958:  4:  9½\r\n  To which adding the average malt tax........  958,895:  3:  0¼\r\n\r\n  The whole amount of those different\r\n                taxes comes out to be........£2,595,835:  7: 10\r\n\r\n  But, by trebling the malt tax,\r\n  or by raising it from six to\r\n  eighteen shillings upon the quarter\r\n  of malt, that single tax would produce.....£2,876,685:  9:  0\r\n  A sum which exceeds the\r\n                         foregoing by....       280,832:  1:  3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Under the old malt tax, indeed, is comprehended a tax of four shillings\r\n      upon the hogshead of cyder, and another of ten shillings upon the barrel\r\n      of mum. In 1774, the tax upon cyder produced only £3,083:6:8. It probably\r\n      fell somewhat short of its usual amount; all the different taxes upon\r\n      cyder, having, that year, produced less than ordinary. The tax upon mum,\r\n      though much heavier, is still less productive, on account of the smaller\r\n      consumption of that liquor. But to balance whatever may be the ordinary\r\n      amount of those two taxes, there is comprehended under what is called the\r\n      country excise, first, the old excise of six shillings and eightpence upon\r\n      the hogshead of cyder; secondly, a like tax of six shillings and\r\n      eightpence upon the hogshead of verjuice; thirdly, another of eight\r\n      shillings and ninepence upon the hogshead of vinegar; and, lastly, a\r\n      fourth tax of elevenpence upon the gallon of mead or metheglin. The\r\n      produce of those different taxes will probably much more than\r\n      counterbalance that of the duties imposed, by what is called the annual\r\n      malt tax, upon cyder and mum.\r\n\r\n      Malt is consumed, not only in the brewery of beer and ale, but in the\r\n      manufacture of low wines and spirits. If the malt tax were to be raised to\r\n      eighteen shillings upon the quarter, it might be necessary to make some\r\n      abatement in the different excises which are imposed upon those particular\r\n      sorts of low wines and spirits, of which malt makes any part of the\r\n      materials. In what are called malt spirits, it makes commonly but a third\r\n      part of the materials; the other two-thirds being either raw barley, or\r\n      one-third barley and one-third wheat. In the distillery of malt spirits,\r\n      both the opportunity and the temptation to smuggle are much greater than\r\n      either in a brewery or in a malt-house; the opportunity, on account of the\r\n      smaller bulk and greater value of the commodity, and the temptation, on\r\n      account of the superior height of the duties, which amounted to 3s. 10\r\n      ⅔d. upon the gallon of spirits. {Though the duties directly imposed upon\r\n      proof spirits amount only to 2s. 6d per gallon, these, added to the duties\r\n      upon the low wines, from which they are distilled, amount to 3s 10 ⅔d.\r\n      Both low wines and proof spirits are, to prevent frauds, now rated\r\n      according to what they gauge in the wash.}\r\n\r\n      By increasing the duties upon malt, and reducing those upon the\r\n      distillery, both the opportunities and the temptation to smuggle would be\r\n      diminished, which might occasion a still further augmentation of revenue.\r\n\r\n      It has for some time past been the policy of Great Britain to discourage\r\n      the consumption of spiritous liquors, on account of their supposed\r\n      tendency to ruin the health and to corrupt the morals of the common\r\n      people. According to this policy, the abatement of the taxes upon the\r\n      distillery ought not to be so great as to reduce, in any respect, the\r\n      price of those liquors. Spiritous liquors might remain as dear as ever;\r\n      while, at the same time, the wholesome and invigorating liquors of beer\r\n      and ale might be considerably reduced in their price. The people might\r\n      thus be in part relieved from one of the burdens of which they at present\r\n      complain the most; while, at the same time, the revenue might be\r\n      considerably augmented.\r\n\r\n      The objections of Dr Davenant to this alteration in the present system of\r\n      excise duties, seem to be without foundation. Those objections are, that\r\n      the tax, instead of dividing itself, as at present, pretty equally upon\r\n      the profit of the maltster, upon that of the brewer and upon that of the\r\n      retailer, would so far as it affected profit, fall altogether upon that of\r\n      the maltster; that the maltster could not so easily get back the amount of\r\n      the tax in the advanced price of his malt, as the brewer and retailer in\r\n      the advanced price of their liquor; and that so heavy a tax upon malt\r\n      might reduce the rent and profit of barley land.\r\n\r\n      No tax can ever reduce, for any considerable time, the rate of profit in\r\n      any particular trade, which must always keep its level with other trades\r\n      in the neighbourhood. The present duties upon malt, beer, and ale, do not\r\n      affect the profits of the dealers in those commodities, who all get back\r\n      the tax with an additional profit, in the enhanced price of their goods. A\r\n      tax, indeed, may render the goods upon which it is imposed so dear, as to\r\n      diminish the consumption of them. But the consumption of malt is in malt\r\n      liquors; and a tax of eighteen shillings upon the quarter of malt could\r\n      not well render those liquors dearer than the different taxes, amounting\r\n      to twenty-four or twenty-five shillings, do at present. Those liquors, on\r\n      the contrary, would probably become cheaper, and the consumption of them\r\n      would be more likely to increase than to diminish.\r\n\r\n      It is not very easy to understand why it should be more difficult for the\r\n      maltster to get back eighteen shillings in the advanced price of his malt,\r\n      than it is at present for the brewer to get back twenty-four or\r\n      twenty-five, sometimes thirty shillings, in that of his liquor. The\r\n      maltster, indeed, instead of a tax of six shillings, would be obliged to\r\n      advance one of eighteen shilling upon every quarter of malt. But the\r\n      brewer is at present obliged to advance a tax of twenty-four or\r\n      twenty-five, sometimes thirty shillings, upon every quarter of malt which\r\n      he brews. It could not be more inconvenient for the maltster to advance a\r\n      lighter tax, than it is at present for the brewer to advance a heavier\r\n      one. The maltster does not always keep in his granaries a stock of malt,\r\n      which it will require a longer time to dispose of than the stock of beer\r\n      and ale which the brewer frequently keeps in his cellars. The former,\r\n      therefore, may frequently get the returns of his money as soon as the\r\n      latter. But whatever inconveniency might arise to the maltster from being\r\n      obliged to advance a heavier tax, it could easily be remedied, by granting\r\n      him a few months longer credit than is at present commonly given to the\r\n      brewer.\r\n\r\n      Nothing could reduce the rent and profit of barley land, which did not\r\n      reduce the demand for barley. But a change of system, which reduced the\r\n      duties upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale, from twenty-four\r\n      and twenty-five shillings to eighteen shillings, would be more likely to\r\n      increase than diminish that demand. The rent and profit of barley land,\r\n      besides, must always be nearly equal to those of other equally fertile and\r\n      equally well cultivated land. If they were less, some part of the barley\r\n      land would soon be turned to some other purpose; and if they were greater,\r\n      more land would soon be turned to the raising of barley. When the ordinary\r\n      price of any particular produce of land is at what may be called a\r\n      monopoly price, a tax upon it necessarily reduces the rent and profit of\r\n      the land which grows it. A tax upon the produce of those precious\r\n      vineyards, of which the wine falls so much short of the effectual demand,\r\n      that its price is always above the natural proportion to that of the\r\n      produce of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land, would\r\n      necessarily reduce the rent and profit of those vineyards. The price of\r\n      the wines being already the highest that could be got for the quantity\r\n      commonly sent to market, it could not be raised higher without diminishing\r\n      that quantity; and the quantity could not be diminished without still\r\n      greater loss, because the lands could not be turned to any other equally\r\n      valuable produce. The whole weight of the tax, therefore, would fall upon\r\n      the rent and profit; properly upon the rent of the vineyard. When it has\r\n      been proposed to lay any new tax upon sugar, our sugar planters have\r\n      frequently complained that the whole weight of such taxes fell not upon\r\n      the consumer, but upon the producer; they never having been able to raise\r\n      the price of their sugar after the tax higher than it was before. The\r\n      price had, it seems, before the tax, been a monopoly price; and the\r\n      arguments adduced to show that sugar was an improper subject of taxation,\r\n      demonstrated perhaps that it was a proper one; the gains of monopolists,\r\n      whenever they can be come at, being certainly of all subjects the most\r\n      proper. But the ordinary price of barley has never been a monopoly price;\r\n      and the rent and profit of barley land have never been above their natural\r\n      proportion to those of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated\r\n      land. The different taxes which have been imposed upon malt, beer, and\r\n      ale, have never lowered the price of barley; have never reduced the rent\r\n      and profit of barley land. The price of malt to the brewer has constantly\r\n      risen in proportion to the taxes imposed upon it; and those taxes,\r\n      together with the different duties upon beer and ale, have constantly\r\n      either raised the price, or, what comes to the same thing, reduced the\r\n      quality of those commodities to the consumer. The final payment of those\r\n      taxes has fallen constantly upon the consumer, and not upon the producer.\r\n\r\n      The only people likely to suffer by the change of system here proposed,\r\n      are those who brew for their own private use. But the exemption, which\r\n      this superior rank of people at present enjoy, from very heavy taxes which\r\n      are paid by the poor labourer and artificer, is surely most unjust and\r\n      unequal, and ought to be taken away, even though this change was never to\r\n      take place. It has probably been the interest of this superior order of\r\n      people, however, which has hitherto prevented a change of system that\r\n      could not well fail both to increase the revenue and to relieve the\r\n      people.\r\n\r\n      Besides such duties as those of custom and excise above mentioned, there\r\n      are several others which affect the price of goods more unequally and more\r\n      indirectly. Of this kind are the duties, which, in French, are called\r\n      peages, which in old Saxon times were called the duties of passage, and\r\n      which seem to have been originally established for the same purpose as our\r\n      turnpike tolls, or the tolls upon our canals and navigable rivers, for the\r\n      maintenance of the road or of the navigation. Those duties, when applied\r\n      to such purposes, are most properly imposed according to the bulk or\r\n      weight of the goods. As they were originally local and provincial duties,\r\n      applicable to local and provincial purposes, the administration of them\r\n      was, in most cases, entrusted to the particular town, parish, or lordship,\r\n      in which they were levied; such communities being, in some way or other,\r\n      supposed to be accountable for the application. The sovereign, who is\r\n      altogether unaccountable, has in many countries assumed to himself the\r\n      administration of those duties; and though he has in most cases enhanced\r\n      very much the duty, he has in many entirely neglected the application. If\r\n      the turnpike tolls of Great Britain should ever become one of the\r\n      resources of government, we may learn, by the example of many other\r\n      nations, what would probably be the consequence. Such tolls, no doubt, are\r\n      finally paid by the consumer; but the consumer is not taxed in proportion\r\n      to his expense, when he pays, not according to the value, but according to\r\n      the bulk or weight of what he consumes. When such duties are imposed, not\r\n      according to the bulk or weight, but according to the supposed value of\r\n      the goods, they become properly a sort of inland customs or excise, which\r\n      obstruct very much the most important of all branches of commerce, the\r\n      interior commerce of the country.\r\n\r\n      In some small states, duties similar to those passage duties are imposed\r\n      upon goods carried across the territory, either by land or by water, from\r\n      one foreign country to another. These are in some countries called\r\n      transit-duties. Some of the little Italian states which are situated upon\r\n      the Po, and the rivers which run into it, derive some revenue from duties\r\n      of this kind, which are paid altogether by foreigners, and which, perhaps,\r\n      are the only duties that one state can impose upon the subjects of\r\n      another, without obstruction in any respect, the industry or commerce of\r\n      its own. The most important transit-duty in the world, is that levied by\r\n      the king of Denmark upon all merchant ships which pass through the Sound.\r\n\r\n      Such taxes upon luxuries, as the greater part of the duties of customs and\r\n      excise, though they all fall indifferently upon every different species of\r\n      revenue, and are paid finally, or without any retribution, by whoever\r\n      consumes the commodities upon which they are imposed; yet they do not\r\n      always fall equally or proportionally upon the revenue of every\r\n      individual. As every man’s humour regulates the degree of his consumption,\r\n      every man contributes rather according to his humour, than proportion to\r\n      his revenue: the profuse contribute more, the parsimonious less, than\r\n      their proper proportion. During the minority of a man of great fortune, he\r\n      contributes commonly very little, by his consumption, towards the support\r\n      of that state from whose protection he derives a great revenue. Those who\r\n      live in another country, contribute nothing by their consumption towards\r\n      the support of the government of that country, in which is situated the\r\n      source of their revenue. If in this latter country there should be no land\r\n      tax, nor any considerable duty upon the transference either of moveable or\r\n      immoveable property, as is the case in Ireland, such absentees may derive\r\n      a great revenue from the protection of a government, to the support of\r\n      which they do not contribute a single shilling. This inequality is likely\r\n      to be greatest in a country of which the government is, in some respects,\r\n      subordinate and dependant upon that of some other. The people who possess\r\n      the most extensive property in the dependant, will, in this case,\r\n      generally chuse to live in the governing country. Ireland is precisely in\r\n      this situation; and we cannot therefore wonder, that the proposal of a tax\r\n      upon absentees should be so very popular in that country. It might,\r\n      perhaps, be a little difficult to ascertain either what sort, or what\r\n      degree of absence, would subject a man to be taxed as an absentee, or at\r\n      what precise time the tax should either begin or end. If you except,\r\n      however, this very peculiar situation, any inequality in the contribution\r\n      of individuals which can arise from such taxes, is much more than\r\n      compensated by the very circumstance which occasions that inequality; the\r\n      circumstance that every man’s contribution is altogether voluntary; it\r\n      being altogether in his power, either to consume, or not to consume, the\r\n      commodity taxed. Where such taxes, therefore, are properly assessed, and\r\n      upon proper commodities, they are paid with less grumbling than any other.\r\n      When they are advanced by the merchant or manufacturer, the consumer, who\r\n      finally pays them, soon comes to confound them with the price of the\r\n      commodities, and almost forgets that he pays any tax. Such taxes are, or\r\n      may be, perfectly certain; or may be assessed, so as to leave no doubt\r\n      concerning either what ought to be paid, or when it ought to be paid;\r\n      concerning either the quantity or the time of payment. What ever\r\n      uncertainty there may sometimes be, either in the duties of customs in\r\n      Great Britain, or in other duties of the same kind in other countries, it\r\n      cannot arise from the nature of those duties, but from the inaccurate or\r\n      unskilful manner in which the law that imposes them is expressed.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon luxuries generally are, and always may be, paid piece-meal, or\r\n      in proportion as the contributors have occasion to purchase the goods upon\r\n      which they are imposed. In the time and mode of payment, they are, or may\r\n      be, of all taxes the most convenient. Upon the whole, such taxes,\r\n      therefore, are perhaps as agreeable to the three first of the four general\r\n      maxims concerning taxation, as any other. They offend in every respect\r\n      against the fourth.\r\n\r\n      Such taxes, in proportion to what they bring into the public treasury of\r\n      the state, always take out, or keep out, of the pockets of the people,\r\n      more than almost any other taxes. They seem to do this in all the four\r\n      different ways in which it is possible to do it.\r\n\r\n      First, the levying of such taxes, even when imposed in the most judicious\r\n      manner, requires a great number of custom-house and excise officers, whose\r\n      salaries and perquisites are a real tax upon the people, which brings\r\n      nothing into the treasury of the state. This expense, however, it must be\r\n      acknowledged, is more moderate in Great Britain than in most other\r\n      countries. In the year which ended on the 5th of July, 1775, the gross\r\n      produce of the different duties, under the management of the commissioners\r\n      of excise in England, amounted to £5,507,308:18:8¼, which was levied at an\r\n      expense of little more than five and a-half per cent. From this gross\r\n      produce, however, there must be deducted what was paid away in bounties\r\n      and drawbacks upon the exportation of exciseable goods, which will reduce\r\n      the neat produce below five millions. {The neat produce of that year,\r\n      after deducting all expenses and allowances, amounted to £4,975,652:19:6.}\r\n      The levying of the salt duty, and excise duty, but under a different\r\n      management, is much more expensive. The neat revenue of the customs does\r\n      not amount to two millions and a-half, which is levied at an expense of\r\n      more than ten per cent., in the salaries of officers and other incidents.\r\n      But the perquisites of custom-house officers are everywhere much greater\r\n      than their salaries; at some ports more than double or triple those\r\n      salaries. If the salaries of officers, and other incidents, therefore,\r\n      amount to more than ten per cent. upon the neat revenue of the customs,\r\n      the whole expense of levying that revenue may amount, in salaries and\r\n      perquisites together, to more than twenty or thirty per cent. The officers\r\n      of excise receive few or no perquisites; and the administration of that\r\n      branch of the revenue being of more recent establishment, is in general\r\n      less corrupted than that of the customs, into which length of time has\r\n      introduced and authorised many abuses. By charging upon malt the whole\r\n      revenue which is at present levied by the different duties upon malt and\r\n      malt liquors, a saving, it is supposed, of more than £50,000, might be\r\n      made in the annual expense of the excise. By confining the duties of\r\n      customs to a few sorts of goods, and by levying those duties according to\r\n      the excise laws, a much greater saving might probably be made in the\r\n      annual expense of the customs.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, such taxes necessarily occasion some obstruction or\r\n      discouragement to certain branches of industry. As they always raise the\r\n      price of the commodity taxed, they so far discourage its consumption, and\r\n      consequently its production. If it is a commodity of home growth or\r\n      manufacture, less labour comes to be employed in raising and producing it.\r\n      If it is a foreign commodity of which the tax increases in this manner the\r\n      price, the commodities of the same kind which are made at home may\r\n      thereby, indeed, gain some advantage in the home market, and a greater\r\n      quantity of domestic industry may thereby be turned toward preparing them.\r\n      But though this rise of price in a foreign commodity, may encourage\r\n      domestic industry in one particular branch, it necessarily discourages\r\n      that industry in almost every other. The dearer the Birmingham\r\n      manufacturer buys his foreign wine, the cheaper he necessarily sells that\r\n      part of his hardware with which, or, what comes to the same thing, with\r\n      the price of which, he buys it. That part of his hardware, therefore,\r\n      becomes of less value to him, and he has less encouragement to work at it.\r\n      The dearer the consumers in one country pay for the surplus produce of\r\n      another, the cheaper they necessarily sell that part of their own surplus\r\n      produce with which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of\r\n      which, they buy it. That part of their own surplus produce becomes of less\r\n      value to them, and they have less encouragement to increase its quantity.\r\n      All taxes upon consumable commodities, therefore, tend to reduce the\r\n      quantity of productive labour below what it otherwise would be, either in\r\n      preparing the commodities taxed, if they are home commodities, or in\r\n      preparing those with which they are purchased, if they are foreign\r\n      commodities. Such taxes, too, always alter, more or less, the natural\r\n      direction of national industry, and turn it into a channel always\r\n      different from, and generally less advantageous, than that in which it\r\n      would have run of its own accord.\r\n\r\n      Thirdly, the hope of evading such taxes by smuggling, gives frequent\r\n      occasion to forfeitures and other penalties, which entirely ruin the\r\n      smuggler; a person who, though no doubt highly blameable for violating the\r\n      laws of his country, is frequently incapable of violating those of natural\r\n      justice, and would have been, in every respect, an excellent citizen, had\r\n      not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to\r\n      be so. In those corrupted governments, where there is at least a general\r\n      suspicion of much unnecessary expense, and great misapplication of the\r\n      public revenue, the laws which guard it are little respected. Not many\r\n      people are scrupulous about smuggling, when, without perjury, they can\r\n      find an easy and safe opportunity of doing so. To pretend to have any\r\n      scruple about buying smuggled goods, though a manifest encouragement to\r\n      the violation of the revenue laws, and to the perjury which almost always\r\n      attends it, would, in most countries, be regarded as one of those pedantic\r\n      pieces of hypocrisy which, instead of gaining credit with anybody, serve\r\n      only to expose the person who affects to practise them to the suspicion of\r\n      being a greater knave than most of his neighbours. By this indulgence of\r\n      the public, the smuggler is often encouraged to continue a trade, which he\r\n      is thus taught to consider as in some measure innocent; and when the\r\n      severity of the revenue laws is ready to fall upon him, he is frequently\r\n      disposed to defend with violence, what he has been accustomed to regard as\r\n      his just property. From being at first, perhaps, rather imprudent than\r\n      criminal, he at last too often becomes one of the hardiest and most\r\n      determined violators of the laws of society. By the ruin of the smuggler,\r\n      his capital, which had before been employed in maintaining productive\r\n      labour, is absorbed either in the revenue of the state, or in that of the\r\n      revenue officer; and is employed in maintaining unproductive, to the\r\n      diminution of the general capital of the society, and of the useful\r\n      industry which it might otherwise have maintained.\r\n\r\n      Fourthly, such taxes, by subjecting at least the dealers in the taxed\r\n      commodities, to the frequent visits and odious examination of the\r\n      tax-gatherers, expose them sometimes, no doubt, to some degree of\r\n      oppression, and always to much trouble and vexation; and though vexation,\r\n      as has already been said, is not strictly speaking expense, it is\r\n      certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing to\r\n      redeem himself from it. The laws of excise, though more effectual for the\r\n      purpose for which they were instituted, are, in this respect, more\r\n      vexatious than those of the customs. When a merchant has imported goods\r\n      subject to certain duties of customs; when he has paid those duties, and\r\n      lodged the goods in his warehouse; he is not, in most cases, liable to any\r\n      further trouble or vexation from the custom-house officer. It is otherwise\r\n      with goods subject to duties of excise. The dealers have no respite from\r\n      the continual visits and examination of the excise officers. The duties of\r\n      excise are, upon this account, more unpopular than those of the customs;\r\n      and so are the officers who levy them. Those officers, it is pretended,\r\n      though in general, perhaps, they do their duty fully as well as those of\r\n      the customs; yet, as that duty obliges them to be frequently very\r\n      troublesome to some of their neighbours, commonly contract a certain\r\n      hardness of character, which the others frequently have not. This\r\n      observation, however, may very probably be the mere suggestion of\r\n      fraudulent dealers, whose smuggling is either prevented or detected by\r\n      their diligence.\r\n\r\n      The inconveniencies, however, which are, perhaps, in some degree\r\n      inseparable from taxes upon consumable communities, fall as light upon the\r\n      people of Great Britain as upon those of any other country of which the\r\n      government is nearly as expensive. Our state is not perfect, and might be\r\n      mended; but it is as good, or better, than that of most of our neighbours.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of the notion, that duties upon consumable goods were taxes\r\n      upon the profits of merchants, those duties have, in some countries, been\r\n      repeated upon every successive sale of the goods. If the profits of the\r\n      merchant-importer or merchant-manufacturer were taxed, equality seemed to\r\n      require that those of all the middle buyers, who intervened between either\r\n      of them and the consumer, should likewise be taxed. The famous alcavala of\r\n      Spain seems to have been established upon this principle. It was at first\r\n      a tax of ten per cent. afterwards of fourteen per cent. and it is at\r\n      present only six per cent. upon the sale of every sort of property whether\r\n      moveable or immoveable; and it is repeated every time the property is\r\n      sold. {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom. i, p. 15} The levying of\r\n      this tax requires a multitude of revenue officers, sufficient to guard the\r\n      transportation of goods, not only from one province to another, but from\r\n      one shop to another. It subjects, not only the dealers in some sorts of\r\n      goods, but those in all sorts, every farmer, every manufacturer, every\r\n      merchant and shopkeeper, to the continual visit and examination of the\r\n      tax-gatherers. Through the greater part of the country in which a tax of\r\n      this kind is established, nothing can be produced for distant sale. The\r\n      produce of every part of the country must be proportioned to the\r\n      consumption of the neighbourhood. It is to the alcavala, accordingly, that\r\n      Ustaritz imputes the ruin of the manufactures of Spain. He might have\r\n      imputed to it, likewise, the declension of agriculture, it being imposed\r\n      not only upon manufactures, but upon the rude produce of the land.\r\n\r\n      In the kingdom of Naples, there is a similar tax of three per cent. upon\r\n      the value of all contracts, and consequently upon that of all contracts of\r\n      sale. It is both lighter than the Spanish tax, and the greater part of\r\n      towns and parishes are allowed to pay a composition in lieu of it. They\r\n      levy this composition in what manner they please, generally in a way that\r\n      gives no interruption to the interior commerce of the place. The\r\n      Neapolitan tax, therefore, is not near so ruinous as the Spanish one.\r\n\r\n      The uniform system of taxation, which, with a few exception of no great\r\n      consequence, takes place in all the different parts of the united kingdom\r\n      of Great Britain, leaves the interior commerce of the country, the inland\r\n      and coasting trade, almost entirely free. The inland trade is almost\r\n      perfectly free; and the greater part of goods may be carried from one end\r\n      of the kingdom to the other, without requiring any permit or let-pass,\r\n      without being subject to question, visit or examination, from the revenue\r\n      officers. There are a few exceptions, but they are such as can give no\r\n      interruption to any important branch of inland commerce of the country.\r\n      Goods carried coastwise, indeed, require certificates or coast-cockets. If\r\n      you except coals, however, the rest are almost all duty-free. This freedom\r\n      of interior commerce, the effect of the uniformity of the system of\r\n      taxation, is perhaps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of\r\n      Great Britain; every great country being necessarily the best and most\r\n      extensive market for the greater part of the productions of its own\r\n      industry. If the same freedom in consequence of the same uniformity, could\r\n      be extended to Ireland and the plantations, both the grandeur of the\r\n      state, and the prosperity of every part of the empire, would probably be\r\n      still greater than at present.\r\n\r\n      In France, the different revenue laws which take place in the different\r\n      provinces, require a multitude of revenue officers to surround, not only\r\n      the frontiers of the kingdom, but those of almost each particular\r\n      province, in order either to prevent the importation of certain goods, or\r\n      to subject it to the payment of certain duties, to the no small\r\n      interruption of the interior commerce of the country. Some provinces are\r\n      allowed to compound for the gabelle, or salt tax; others are exempted from\r\n      it altogether. Some provinces are exempted from the exclusive sale of\r\n      tobacco, which the farmers-general enjoy through the greater part of the\r\n      kingdom. The aides, which correspond to the excise in England, are very\r\n      different in different provinces. Some provinces are exempted from them,\r\n      and pay a composition or equivalent. In those in which they take place,\r\n      and are in farm, there are many local duties which do not extend beyond a\r\n      particular town or district. The traites, which correspond to our customs,\r\n      divide the kingdom into three great parts; first, the provinces subject to\r\n      the tariff of 1664, which are called the provinces of the five great\r\n      farms, and under which are comprehended Picardy, Normandy, and the greater\r\n      part of the interior provinces of the kingdom; secondly, the provinces\r\n      subject to the tariff of 1667, which are called the provinces reckoned\r\n      foreign, and under which are comprehended the greater part of the frontier\r\n      provinces; and, thirdly, those provinces which are said to be treated as\r\n      foreign, or which, because they are allowed a free commerce with foreign\r\n      countries, are, in their commerce with the other provinces of France,\r\n      subjected to the same duties as other foreign countries. These are Alsace,\r\n      the three bishoprics of Mentz, Toul, and Verdun, and the three cities of\r\n      Dunkirk, Bayonne, and Marseilles. Both in the provinces of the five great\r\n      farms (called so on account of an ancient division of the duties of\r\n      customs into five great branches, each of which was originally the subject\r\n      of a particular farm, though they are now all united into one), and in\r\n      those which are said to be reckoned foreign, there are many local duties\r\n      which do not extend beyond a particular town or district. There are some\r\n      such even in the provinces which are said to be treated as foreign,\r\n      particularly in the city of Marseilles. It is unnecessary to observe how\r\n      much both the restraints upon the interior commerce of the country, and\r\n      the number of the revenue officers, must be multiplied, in order to guard\r\n      the frontiers of those different provinces and districts which are subject\r\n      to such different systems of taxation.\r\n\r\n      Over and above the general restraints arising from this complicated system\r\n      of revenue laws, the commerce of wine (after corn, perhaps, the most\r\n      important production of France) is, in the greater part of the provinces,\r\n      subject to particular restraints arising from the favour which has been\r\n      shown to the vineyards of particular provinces and districts above those\r\n      of others. The provinces most famous for their wines, it will be found, I\r\n      believe, are those in which the trade in that article is subject to the\r\n      fewest restraints of this kind. The extensive market which such provinces\r\n      enjoy, encourages good management both in the cultivation of their\r\n      vineyards, and in the subsequent preparation of their wines.\r\n\r\n      Such various and complicated revenue laws are not peculiar to France. The\r\n      little duchy of Milan is divided into six provinces, in each of which\r\n      there is a different system of taxation, with regard to several different\r\n      sorts of consumable goods. The still smaller territories of the duke of\r\n      Parma are divided into three or four, each of which has, in the same\r\n      manner, a system of its own. Under such absurd management, nothing but the\r\n      great fertility of the soil, and happiness of the climate, could preserve\r\n      such countries from soon relapsing into the lowest state of poverty and\r\n      barbarism.\r\n\r\n      Taxes upon consumable commodities may either be levied by an\r\n      administration, of which the officers are appointed by govermnent, and are\r\n      immediately accountable to government, of which the revenue must, in this\r\n      case, vary from year to year, according to the occasional variations in\r\n      the produce of the tax; or they may be let in farm for a rent certain, the\r\n      farmer being allowed to appoint his own officers, who, though obliged to\r\n      levy the tax in the manner directed by the law, are under his immediate\r\n      inspection, and are immediately accountable to him. The best and most\r\n      frugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm. Over and above what is\r\n      necessary for paying the stipulated rent, the salaries of the officers,\r\n      and the whole expense of administration, the farmer must always draw from\r\n      the produce of the tax a certain profit, proportioned at least to the\r\n      advance which he makes, to the risk which he runs, to the trouble which he\r\n      is at, and to the knowledge and skill which it requires to manage so very\r\n      complicated a concern. Government, by establishing an administration under\r\n      their own immediate inspection, of the same kind with that which the\r\n      farmer establishes, might at least save this profit, which is almost\r\n      always exorbitant. To farm any considerable branch of the public revenue\r\n      requires either a great capital, or a great credit; circumstances which\r\n      would alone restrain the competition for such an undertaking to a very\r\n      small number of people. Of the few who have this capital or credit, a\r\n      still smaller number have the necessary knowledge or experience; another\r\n      circumstance which restrains the competition still further. The very few\r\n      who are in condition to become competitors, find it more for their\r\n      interest to combine together; to become copartners, instead of\r\n      competitors; and, when the farm is set up to auction, to offer no rent but\r\n      what is much below the real value. In countries where the public revenues\r\n      are in farm, the farmers are generally the most opulent people. Their\r\n      wealth would alone excite the public indignation; and the vanity which\r\n      almost always accompanies such upstart fortunes, the foolish ostentation\r\n      with which they commonly display that wealth, excite that indignation\r\n      still more.\r\n\r\n      The farmers of the public revenue never find the laws too severe, which\r\n      punish any attempt to evade the payment of a tax. They have no bowels for\r\n      the contributors, who are not their subjects, and whose universal\r\n      bankruptcy, if it should happen the day after the farm is expired, would\r\n      not much affect their interest. In the greatest exigencies of the state,\r\n      when the anxiety of the sovereign for the exact payment of his revenue is\r\n      necessarily the greatest, they seldom fail to complain, that without laws\r\n      more rigorous than those which actually took place, it will be impossible\r\n      for them to pay even the usual rent. In those moments of public distress,\r\n      their commands cannot be disputed. The revenue laws, therefore, become\r\n      gradually more and more severe. The most sanguinary are always to be found\r\n      in countries where the greater part of the public revenue is in farm; the\r\n      mildest, in countries where it is levied under the immediate inspection of\r\n      the sovereign. Even a bad sovereign feels more compassion for his people\r\n      than can ever be expected from the farmers of his revenue. He knows that\r\n      the permanent grandeur of his family depends upon the prosperity of his\r\n      people, and he will never knowingly ruin that prosperity for the sake of\r\n      any momentary interest of his own. It is otherwise with the farmers of his\r\n      revenue, whose grandeur may frequently be the effect of the ruin, and not\r\n      of the prosperity, of his people.\r\n\r\n      A tax is sometimes not only farmed for a certain rent, but the farmer has,\r\n      besides, the monopoly of the commodity taxed. In France, the duties upon\r\n      tobacco and salt are levied in this manner. In such cases, the farmer,\r\n      instead of one, levies two exorbitant profits upon the people; the profit\r\n      of the farmer, and the still more exorbitant one of the monopolist.\r\n      Tobacco being a luxury, every man is allowed to buy or not to buy as he\r\n      chuses; but salt being a necessary, every man is obliged to buy of the\r\n      farmer a certain quantity of it; because, if he did not buy this quantity\r\n      of the farmer, he would, it is presumed, buy it of some smuggler. The\r\n      taxes upon both commodities are exorbitant. The temptation to smuggle,\r\n      consequently, is to many people irresistible; while, at the same time, the\r\n      rigour of the law, and the vigilance of the farmer’s officers, render the\r\n      yielding to the temptation almost certainly ruinous. The smuggling of salt\r\n      and tobacco sends every year several hundred people to the galleys,\r\n      besides a very considerable number whom it sends to the gibbet. Those\r\n      taxes, levied in this manner, yield a very considerable revenue to\r\n      government. In 1767, the farm of tobacco was let for twenty-two millions\r\n      five hundred and forty-one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight livres\r\n      a-year; that of salt for thirty-six millions four hundred and ninety-two\r\n      thousand four hundred and four livres. The farm, in both cases, was to\r\n      commence in 1768, and to last for six years. Those who consider the blood\r\n      of the people as nothing, in comparison with the revenue of the prince,\r\n      may, perhaps, approve of this method of levying taxes. Similar taxes and\r\n      monopolies of salt and tobacco have been established in many other\r\n      countries, particularly in the Austrian and Prussian dominions, and in the\r\n      greater part of the states of Italy.\r\n\r\n      In France, the greater part of the actual revenue of the crown is derived\r\n      from eight different sources; the taille, the capitation, the two\r\n      vingtiemes, the gabelles, the aides, the traites, the domaine, and the\r\n      farm of tobacco. The five last are, in the greater part of the provinces,\r\n      under farm. The three first are everywhere levied by an administration,\r\n      under the immediate inspection and direction of government; and it is\r\n      universally acknowledged, that in proportion to what they take out of the\r\n      pockets of the people, they bring more into the treasury of the prince\r\n      than the other five, of which the administration is much more wasteful and\r\n      expensive.\r\n\r\n      The finances of France seem, in their present state, to admit of three\r\n      very obvious reformations. First, by abolishing the taille and the\r\n      capitation, and by increasing the number of the vingtiemes, so as to\r\n      produce an additional revenue equal to the amount of those other taxes,\r\n      the revenue of the crown might be preserved; the expense of collection\r\n      might be much diminished; the vexation of the inferior ranks of people,\r\n      which the taille and capitation occasion, might be entirely prevented; and\r\n      the superior ranks might not be more burdened than the greater part of\r\n      them are at present. The vingtieme, I have already observed, is a tax very\r\n      nearly of the same kind with what is called the land tax of England. The\r\n      burden of the taille, it is acknowledged, falls finally upon the\r\n      proprietors of land; and as the greater part of the capitation is assessed\r\n      upon those who are subject to the taille, at so much a-pound of that other\r\n      tax, the final payment of the greater part of it must likewise fall upon\r\n      the same order of people. Though the number of the vingtiemes, therefore,\r\n      was increased, so as to produce an additional revenue equal to the amount\r\n      of both those taxes, the superior ranks of people might not be more\r\n      burdened than they are at present; many individuals, no doubt, would, on\r\n      account of the great inequalities with which the taille is commonly\r\n      assessed upon the estates and tenants of different individuals. The\r\n      interest and opposition of such favoured subjects, are the obstacles most\r\n      likely to prevent this, or any other reformation of the same kind.\r\n      Secondly, by rendering the gabelle, the aides, the traites, the taxes upon\r\n      tobacco, all the different customs and excises, uniform in all the\r\n      different parts of the kingdom, those taxes might be levied at much less\r\n      expense, and the interior commerce of the kingdom might be rendered as\r\n      free as that of England. Thirdly, and lastly, by subjecting all those\r\n      taxes to an administration under the immediate inspection and direction or\r\n      government, the exorbitant profits of the farmers-general might be added\r\n      to the revenue of the state. The opposition arising from the private\r\n      interest of individuals, is likely to be as effectual for preventing the\r\n      two last as the first-mentioned scheme of reformation.\r\n\r\n      The French system of taxation seems, in every respect, inferior to the\r\n      British. In Great Britain, ten millions sterling are annually levied upon\r\n      less than eight millions of people, without its being possible to say that\r\n      any particular order is oppressed. From the Collections of the Abbé\r\n      Expilly, and the observations of the author of the Essay upon the\r\n      Legislation and Commerce of Corn, it appears probable that France,\r\n      including the provinces of Lorraine and Bar, contains about twenty-three\r\n      or twenty-four millions of people; three times the number, perhaps,\r\n      contained in Great Britain. The soil and climate of France are better than\r\n      those of Great Britain. The country has been much longer in a state of\r\n      improvement and cultivation, and is, upon that account, better stocked\r\n      with all those things which it requires a long time to raise up and\r\n      accumulate; such as great towns, and convenient and well-built houses,\r\n      both in town and country. With these advantages, it might be expected,\r\n      that in France a revenue of thirty millions might be levied for the\r\n      support of the state, with as little inconvenience as a revenue of ten\r\n      millions is in Great Britain. In 1765 and 1766, the whole revenue paid\r\n      into the treasury of France, according to the best, though, I acknowledge,\r\n      very imperfect accounts which I could get of it, usually run between 308\r\n      and 325 millions of livres; that is, it did not amount to fifteen millions\r\n      sterling; not the half of what might have been expected, had the people\r\n      contributed in the same proportion to their numbers as the people of Great\r\n      Britain. The people of France, however, it is generally acknowledged, are\r\n      much more oppressed by taxes than the people of Great Britain. France,\r\n      however, is certainly the great empire in Europe, which, after that of\r\n      Great Britain, enjoys the mildest and most indulgent government.\r\n\r\n      In Holland, the heavy taxes upon the necessaries of life have ruined, it\r\n      is said, their principal manufacturers, and are likely to discourage,\r\n      gradually, even their fisheries and their trade in ship-building. The\r\n      taxes upon the necessaries of life are inconsiderable in Great Britain,\r\n      and no manufacture has hitherto been ruined by them. The British taxes\r\n      which bear hardest on manufactures, are some duties upon the importation\r\n      of raw materials, particularly upon that of raw silk. The revenue of the\r\n      States-General and of the different cities, however, is said to amount to\r\n      more than five millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling;\r\n      and as the inhabitants of the United Provinces cannot well be supposed to\r\n      amount to more than a third part of those of Great Britain, they must, in\r\n      proportion to their number, be much more heavily taxed.\r\n\r\n      After all the proper subjects of taxation have been exhausted, if the\r\n      exigencies of the state still continue to require new taxes, they must be\r\n      imposed upon improper ones. The taxes upon the necessaries of life,\r\n      therefore, may be no impeachment of the wisdom of that republic, which, in\r\n      order to acquire and to maintain its independency, has, in spite of its\r\n      great frugality, been involved in such expensive wars as have obliged it to\r\n      contract great debts. The singular countries of Holland and Zealand,\r\n      besides, require a considerable expense even to preserve their existence,\r\n      or to prevent their being swallowed up by the sea, which must have\r\n      contributed to increase considerably the load of taxes in those two\r\n      provinces. The republican form of government seems to be the principal\r\n      support of the present grandeur of Holland. The owners of great capitals,\r\n      the great mercantile families, have generally either some direct share, or\r\n      some indirect influence, in the administration of that government. For the\r\n      sake of the respect and authority which they derive from this situation,\r\n      they are willing to live in a country where their capital, if they employ\r\n      it themselves, will bring them less profit, and if they lend it to\r\n      another, less interest; and where the very moderate revenue which they can\r\n      draw from it will purchase less of the necessaries and conveniencies of\r\n      life than in any other part of Europe. The residence of such wealthy\r\n      people necessarily keeps alive, in spite of all disadvantages, a certain\r\n      degree of industry in the country. Any public calamity which should\r\n      destroy the republican form of government, which should throw the whole\r\n      administration into the hands of nobles and of soldiers, which should\r\n      annihilate altogether the importance of those wealthy merchants, would\r\n      soon render it disagreeable to them to live in a country where they were\r\n      no longer likely to be much respected. They would remove both their\r\n      residence and their capital to some other country, and the industry and\r\n      commerce of Holland would soon follow the capitals which supported them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOF PUBLIC DEBTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In that rude state of society which precedes the extension of commerce and\r\n      the improvement of manufactures; when those expensive luxuries, which\r\n      commerce and manufactures can alone introduce, are altogether unknown; the\r\n      person who possesses a large revenue, I have endeavoured to show in the\r\n      third book of this Inquiry, can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other\r\n      way than by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain. A large\r\n      revenue may at all times be said to consist in the command of a large\r\n      quantity of the necessaries of life. In that rude state of things, it is\r\n      commonly paid in a large quantity of those necessaries, in the materials\r\n      of plain food and coarse clothing, in corn and cattle, in wool and raw\r\n      hides. When neither commerce nor manufactures furnish any thing for which\r\n      the owner can exchange the greater part of those materials which are over\r\n      and above his own consumption, he can do nothing with the surplus, but\r\n      feed and clothe nearly as many people as it will feed and clothe. A\r\n      hospitality in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there\r\n      is no ostentation, occasion, in this situation of things, the principal\r\n      expenses of the rich and the great. But these I have likewise endeavoured\r\n      to show, in the same book, are expenses by which people are not very apt\r\n      to ruin themselves. There is not, perhaps, any selfish pleasure so\r\n      frivolous, of which the pursuit has not sometimes ruined even sensible\r\n      men. A passion for cock-fighting has ruined many. But the instances, I\r\n      believe, are not very numerous, of people who have been ruined by a\r\n      hospitality or liberality of this kind; though the hospitality of luxury,\r\n      and the liberality of ostentation have ruined many. Among our feudal\r\n      ancestors, the long time during which estates used to continue in the same\r\n      family, sufficiently demonstrates the general disposition of people to\r\n      live within their income. Though the rustic hospitality, constantly\r\n      exercised by the great landholders, may not, to us in the present times,\r\n      seem consistent with that order which we are apt to consider as\r\n      inseparably connected with good economy; yet we must certainly allow them\r\n      to have been at least so far frugal, as not commonly to have spent their\r\n      whole income. A part of their wool and raw hides, they had generally an\r\n      opportunity of selling for money. Some part of this money, perhaps, they\r\n      spent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury, with which the\r\n      circumstances of the times could furnish them; but some part of it they\r\n      seem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well, indeed, do any thing\r\n      else but hoard whatever money they saved. To trade, was disgraceful to a\r\n      gentleman; and to lend money at interest, which at that time was\r\n      considered as usury, and prohibited by law, would have been still more so.\r\n      In those times of violence and disorder, besides, it was convenient to\r\n      have a hoard of money at hand, that in case they should be driven from\r\n      their own home, they might have something of known value to carry with\r\n      them to some place of safety. The same violence which made it convenient\r\n      to hoard, made it equally convenient to conceal the hoard. The frequency\r\n      of treasure-trove, or of treasure found, of which no owner was known,\r\n      sufficiently demonstrates the frequency, in those times, both of hoarding\r\n      and of concealing the hoard. Treasure-trove was then considered as an\r\n      important branch of the revenue of the sovereign. All the treasure-trove\r\n      of the kingdom would scarce, perhaps, in the present times, make an\r\n      important branch of the revenue of a private gentleman of a good estate.\r\n\r\n      The same disposition, to save and to hoard, prevailed in the sovereign, as\r\n      well as in the subjects. Among nations, to whom commerce and manufacture\r\n      are little known, the sovereign, it has already been observed in the\r\n      Fourth book, is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the\r\n      parsimony requisite for accumulation. In that situation, the expense, even\r\n      of a sovereign, cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the\r\n      gaudy finery of a court. The ignorance of the times affords but few of the\r\n      trinkets in which that finery consists. Standing armies are not then\r\n      necessary; so that the expense, even of a sovereign, like that of any\r\n      other great lord can be employed in scarce any thing but bounty to his\r\n      tenants, and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and hospitality very\r\n      seldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost always does. All the\r\n      ancient sovereigns of Europe, accordingly, it has already been observed,\r\n      had treasures. Every Tartar chief, in the present times, is said to have\r\n      one.\r\n\r\n      In a commercial country, abounding with every sort of expensive luxury,\r\n      the sovereign, in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in\r\n      his dominions, naturally spends a great part of his revenue in purchasing\r\n      those luxuries. His own and the neighbouring countries supply him\r\n      abundantly with all the costly trinkets which compose the splendid, but\r\n      insignificant, pageantry of a court. For the sake of an inferior pageantry\r\n      of the same kind, his nobles dismiss their retainers, make their tenants\r\n      independent, and become gradually themselves as insignificant as the\r\n      greater part of the wealthy burghers in his dominions. The same frivolous\r\n      passions, which influence their conduct, influence his. How can it be\r\n      supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is\r\n      insensible to pleasures of this kind? If he does not, what he is very\r\n      likely to do, spend upon those pleasures so great a part of his revenue as\r\n      to debilitate very much the defensive power of the state, it cannot well\r\n      be expected that he should not spend upon them all that part of it which\r\n      is over and above what is necessary for supporting that defensive power.\r\n      His ordinary expense becomes equal to his ordinary revenue, and it is well\r\n      if it does not frequently exceed it. The amassing of treasure can no\r\n      longer be expected; and when extraordinary exigencies require\r\n      extraordinary expenses, he must necessarily call upon his subjects for an\r\n      extraordinary aid. The present and the late king of Prussia are the only\r\n      great princes of Europe, who, since the death of Henry IV. of France, in\r\n      1610, are supposed to have amassed any considerable treasure. The\r\n      parsimony which leads to accumulation has become almost as rare in\r\n      republican as in monarchical governments. The Italian republics, the\r\n      United Provinces of the Netherlands, are all in debt. The canton of Berne\r\n      is the single republic in Europe which has amassed any considerable\r\n      treasure. The other Swiss republics have not. The taste for some sort of\r\n      pageantry, for splendid buildings, at least, and other public ornaments,\r\n      frequently prevails as much in the apparently sober senate-house of a\r\n      little republic, as in the dissipated court of the greatest king.\r\n\r\n      The want of parsimony, in time of peace, imposes the necessity of\r\n      contracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in the\r\n      treasury, but what is necessary for carrying on the ordinary expense of\r\n      the peace establishment. In war, an establishment of three or four times\r\n      that expense becomes necessary for the defence of the state; and\r\n      consequently, a revenue three or four times greater than the peace\r\n      revenue. Supposing that the sovereign should have, what he scarce ever\r\n      has, the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the\r\n      augmentation of his expense; yet still the produce of the taxes, from\r\n      which this increase of revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come into\r\n      the treasury, till perhaps ten or twelve months after they are imposed.\r\n      But the moment in which war begins, or rather the moment in which it\r\n      appears likely to begin, the army must be augmented, the fleet must be\r\n      fitted out, the garrisoned towns must be put into a posture of defence;\r\n      that army, that fleet, those garrisoned towns, must be furnished with\r\n      arms, ammunition, and provisions. An immediate and great expense must be\r\n      incurred in that moment of immediate danger, which will not wait for the\r\n      gradual and slow returns of the new taxes. In this exigency, government\r\n      can have no other resource but in borrowing.\r\n\r\n      The same commercial state of society which, by the operation of moral\r\n      causes, brings government in this manner into the necessity of borrowing,\r\n      produces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination to lend. If it\r\n      commonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing, it likewise\r\n      brings with it the facility of doing so.\r\n\r\n      A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, necessarily abounds\r\n      with a set of people through whose hands, not only their own capitals, but\r\n      the capitals of all those who either lend them money, or trust them with\r\n      goods, pass as frequently, or more frequently, than the revenue of a\r\n      private man, who, without trade or business, lives upon his income, passes\r\n      through his hands. The revenue of such a man can regularly pass through\r\n      his hands only once in a year. But the whole amount of the capital and\r\n      credit of a merchant, who deals in a trade of which the returns are very\r\n      quick, may sometimes pass through his hands two, three, or four times in a\r\n      year. A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, therefore,\r\n      necessarily abounds with a set of people, who have it at all times in\r\n      their power to advance, if they chuse to do so, a very large sum of money\r\n      to government. Hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to\r\n      lend.\r\n\r\n      Commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does\r\n      not enjoy a regular administration of justice; in which the people do not\r\n      feel themselves secure in the possession of their property; in which the\r\n      faith of contracts is not supported by law; and in which the authority of\r\n      the state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the\r\n      payment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and\r\n      manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state, in which there\r\n      is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government. The\r\n      same confidence which disposes great merchants and manufacturers upon\r\n      ordinary occasions, to trust their property to the protection of a\r\n      particular government, disposes them, upon extraordinary occasions, to\r\n      trust that government with the use of their property. By lending money to\r\n      government, they do not even for a moment diminish their ability to carry\r\n      on their trade and manufactures; on the contrary, they commonly augment\r\n      it. The necessities of the state render government, upon most occasions\r\n      willing to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender. The\r\n      security which it grants to the original creditor, is made transferable to\r\n      any other creditor; and from the universal confidence in the justice of\r\n      the state, generally sells in the market for more than was originally paid\r\n      for it. The merchant or monied man makes money by lending money to\r\n      government, and instead of diminishing, increases his trading capital. He\r\n      generally considers it as a favour, therefore, when the administration\r\n      admits him to a share in the first subscription for a new loan. Hence the\r\n      inclination or willingness in the subjects of a commercial state to lend.\r\n\r\n      The government of such a state is very apt to repose itself upon this\r\n      ability and willingness of its subjects to lend it their money on\r\n      extraordinary occasions. It foresees the facility of borrowing, and\r\n      therefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving.\r\n\r\n      In a rude state of society, there are no great mercantile or manufacturing\r\n      capitals. The individuals, who hoard whatever money they can save, and who\r\n      conceal their hoard, do so from a distrust of the justice of government;\r\n      from a fear, that if it was known that they had a hoard, and where that\r\n      hoard was to be found, they would quickly be plundered. In such a state of\r\n      things, few people would be able, and nobody would be willing to lend\r\n      their money to government on extraordinary exigencies. The sovereign feels\r\n      that he must provide for such exigencies by saving, because he foresees\r\n      the absolute impossibility of borrowing. This foresight increases still\r\n      further his natural disposition to save.\r\n\r\n      The progress of the enormous debts which at present oppress, and will in\r\n      the long-run probably ruin, all the great nations of Europe, has been\r\n      pretty uniform. Nations, like private men, have generally begun to borrow\r\n      upon what may be called personal credit, without assigning or mortgaging\r\n      any particular fund for the payment of the debt; and when this resource\r\n      has failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mortgages\r\n      of particular funds.\r\n\r\n      What is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain, is contracted in the\r\n      former of those two ways. It consists partly in a debt which bears, or is\r\n      supposed to bear, no interest, and which resembles the debts that a\r\n      private man contracts upon account; and partly in a debt which bears\r\n      interest, and which resembles what a private man contracts upon his bill\r\n      or promissory-note. The debts which are due, either for extraordinary\r\n      services, or for services either not provided for, or not paid at the time\r\n      when they are performed; part of the extraordinaries of the army, navy,\r\n      and ordnance, the arrears of subsidies to foreign princes, those of\r\n      seamen’s wages, etc. usually constitute a debt of the first kind. Navy and\r\n      exchequer bills, which are issued sometimes in payment of a part of such\r\n      debts, and sometimes for other purposes, constitute a debt of the second\r\n      kind; exchequer bills bearing interest from the day on which they are\r\n      issued, and navy bills six months after they are issued. The bank of\r\n      England, either by voluntarily discounting those bills at their current\r\n      value, or by agreeing with government for certain considerations to\r\n      circulate exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at par, paying the\r\n      interest which happens to be due upon them, keeps up their value, and\r\n      facilitates their circulation, and thereby frequently enables government\r\n      to contract a very large debt of this kind. In France, where there is no\r\n      bank, the state bills (billets d’etat {See Examen des Reflections\r\n      Politiques sur les Finances.}) have sometimes sold at sixty and seventy\r\n      per cent. discount. During the great recoinage in king William’s time,\r\n      when the bank of England thought proper to put a stop to its usual\r\n      transactions, exchequer bills and tallies are said to have sold from\r\n      twenty-five to sixty per cent. discount; owing partly, no doubt, to the\r\n      supposed instability of the new government established by the Revolution,\r\n      but partly, too, to the want of the support of the bank of England.\r\n\r\n      When this resource is exhausted, and it becomes necessary, in order to\r\n      raise money, to assign or mortgage some particular branch of the public\r\n      revenue for the payment of the debt, government has, upon different\r\n      occasions, done this in two different ways. Sometimes it has made this\r\n      assignment or mortgage for a short period of time only, a year, or a few\r\n      years, for example; and sometimes for perpetuity. In the one case, the\r\n      fund was supposed sufficient to pay, within the limited time, both\r\n      principal and interest of the money borrowed. In the other, it was\r\n      supposed sufficient to pay the interest only, or a perpetual annuity\r\n      equivalent to the interest, government being at liberty to redeem, at any\r\n      time, this annuity, upon paying back the principal sum borrowed. When\r\n      money was raised in the one way, it was said to be raised by anticipation;\r\n      when in the other, by perpetual funding, or, more shortly, by funding.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, the annual land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated\r\n      every year, by virtue of a borrowing clause constantly inserted into the\r\n      acts which impose them. The bank of England generally advances at an\r\n      interest, which, since the Revolution, has varied from eight to three per\r\n      cent., the sums of which those taxes are granted, and receives payment as\r\n      their produce gradually comes in. If there is a deficiency, which there\r\n      always is, it is provided for in the supplies of the ensuing year. The\r\n      only considerable branch of the public revenue which yet remains\r\n      unmortgaged, is thus regularly spent before it comes in. Like an\r\n      improvident spendthrift, whose pressing occasions will not allow him to\r\n      wait for the regular payment of his revenue, the state is in the constant\r\n      practice of borrowing of its own factors and agents, and of paying\r\n      interest for the use of its own money.\r\n\r\n      In the reign of king William, and during a great part of that of queen\r\n      Anne, before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice of\r\n      perpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but for\r\n      a short period of time (for four, five, six, or seven years only), and a\r\n      great part of the grants of every year consisted in loans upon\r\n      anticipations of the produce of those taxes. The produce being frequently\r\n      insufficient for paying, within the limited term, the principal and\r\n      interest of the money borrowed, deficiencies arose; to make good which, it\r\n      became necessary to prolong the term.\r\n\r\n      In 1697, by the 8th of William III., c. 20, the deficiencies of several\r\n      taxes were charged upon what was then called the first general mortgage or\r\n      fund, consisting of a prolongation to the first of August 1706, of several\r\n      different taxes, which would have expired within a shorter term, and of\r\n      which the produce was accumulated into one general fund. The deficiencies\r\n      charged upon this prolonged term amounted to £5,160,459: 14: 9½.\r\n\r\n      In 1701, those duties, with some others, were still further prolonged, for\r\n      the like purposes, till the first of August 1710, and were called the\r\n      second general mortgage or fund. The deficiencies charged upon it amounted\r\n      to £2,055,999: 7: 11½.\r\n\r\n      In 1707, those duties were still further prolonged, as a fund for new\r\n      loans, to the first of August 1712, and were called the third general\r\n      mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was £983,254:11:9¼.\r\n\r\n      In 1708, those duties were all (except the old subsidy of tonnage and\r\n      poundage, of which one moiety only was made a part of this fund, and a\r\n      duty upon the importation of Scotch linen, which had been taken off by the\r\n      articles of union) still further continued, as a fund for new loans, to\r\n      the first of August 1714, and were called the fourth general mortgage or\r\n      fund. The sum borrowed upon it was £925,176:9:2¼.\r\n\r\n      In 1709, those duties were all (except the old subsidy of tonnage and\r\n      poundage, which was now left out of this fund altogether) still further\r\n      continued, for the same purpose, to the first of August 1716, and were\r\n      called the fifth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was\r\n      £922,029:6s.\r\n\r\n      In 1710, those duties were again prolonged to the first of August 1720,\r\n      and were called the sixth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon\r\n      it was £1,296,552:9:11¾.\r\n\r\n      In 1711, the same duties (which at this time were thus subject to four\r\n      different anticipations), together with several others, were continued for\r\n      ever, and made a fund for paying the interest of the capital of the\r\n      South-sea company, which had that year advanced to government, for paying\r\n      debts, and making good deficiencies, the sum of £9,177,967:15:4d, the\r\n      greatest loan which at that time had ever been made.\r\n\r\n      Before this period, the principal, so far as I have been able to observe,\r\n      the only taxes, which, in order to pay the interest of a debt, had been\r\n      imposed for perpetuity, were those for paying the interest of the money\r\n      which had been advanced to government by the bank and East-India company,\r\n      and of what it was expected would be advanced, but which was never\r\n      advanced, by a projected land bank. The bank fund at this time amounted to\r\n      £3,375,027:17:10½, for which was paid an annuity or interest of\r\n      £206,501:15:5d. The East-India fund amounted to £3,200,000, for which was\r\n      paid an annuity or interest of £160,000; the bank fund being at six per\r\n      cent., the East-India fund at five per cent. interest.\r\n\r\n      In 1715, by the first of George I., c. 12, the different taxes which had\r\n      been mortgaged for paying the bank annuity, together with several others,\r\n      which, by this act, were likewise rendered perpetual, were accumulated\r\n      into one common fund, called the aggregate fund, which was charged not\r\n      only with the payment of the bank annuity, but with several other\r\n      annuities and burdens of different kinds. This fund was afterwards\r\n      augmented by the third of George I., c.8., and by the fifth of George I.,\r\n      c. 3, and the different duties which were then added to it were likewise\r\n      rendered perpetual.\r\n\r\n      In 1717, by the third of George I., c. 7, several other taxes were\r\n      rendered perpetual, and accumulated into another common fund, called the\r\n      general fund, for the payment of certain annuities, amounting in the whole\r\n      to £724,849:6:10½.\r\n\r\n      In consequence of those different acts, the greater part of the taxes,\r\n      which before had been anticipated only for a short term of years were\r\n      rendered perpetual, as a fund for paying, not the capital, but the\r\n      interest only, of the money which had been borrowed upon them by different\r\n      successive anticipations.\r\n\r\n      Had money never been raised but by anticipation, the course of a few years\r\n      would have liberated the public revenue, without any other attention of\r\n      government besides that of not overloading the fund, by charging it with\r\n      more debt than it could pay within the limited term, and not of\r\n      anticipating a second time before the expiration of the first\r\n      anticipation. But the greater part of European governments have been\r\n      incapable of those attentions. They have frequently overloaded the fund,\r\n      even upon the first anticipation; and when this happened not to be the\r\n      case, they have generally taken care to overload it, by anticipating a\r\n      second and a third time, before the expiration of the first anticipation.\r\n      The fund becoming in this manner altogether insufficient for paying both\r\n      principal and interest of the money borrowed upon it, it became necessary\r\n      to charge it with the interest only, or a perpetual annuity equal to the\r\n      interest; and such improvident anticipations necessarily gave birth to the\r\n      more ruinous practice of perpetual funding. But though this practice\r\n      necessarily puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed\r\n      period, to one so indefinite that it is not very likely ever to arrive;\r\n      yet, as a greater sum can, in all cases, be raised by this new practice\r\n      than by the old one of anticipation, the former, when men have once become\r\n      familiar with it, has, in the great exigencies of the state, been\r\n      universally preferred to the latter. To relieve the present exigency, is\r\n      always the object which principally interests those immediately concerned\r\n      in the administration of public affairs. The future liberation of the\r\n      public revenue they leave to the care of posterity.\r\n\r\n      During the reign of queen Anne, the market rate of interest had fallen\r\n      from six to five per cent.; and, in the twelfth year of her reign, five\r\n      per cent. was declared to be the highest rate which could lawfully be\r\n      taken for money borrowed upon private security. Soon after the greater\r\n      part of the temporary taxes of Great Britain had been rendered perpetual,\r\n      and distributed into the aggregate, South-sea, and general funds, the\r\n      creditors of the public, like those of private persons, were induced to\r\n      accept of five per cent. for the interest of their money, which occasioned\r\n      a saving of one per cent. upon the capital of the greater part or the\r\n      debts which had been thus funded for perpetuity, or of one-sixth of the\r\n      greater part of the annuities which were paid out of the three great funds\r\n      above mentioned. This saving left a considerable surplus in the produce of\r\n      the different taxes which had been accumulated into those funds, over and\r\n      above what was necessary for paying the annuities which were now charged\r\n      upon them, and laid the foundation of what has since been called the\r\n      sinking fund. In 1717, it amounted to £523,454:7:7½. In 1727, the interest\r\n      of the greater part of the public debts was still further reduced to four\r\n      per cent.; and, in 1753 and 1757, to three and a-half, and three per\r\n      cent., which reductions still further augmented the sinking fund.\r\n\r\n      A sinking fund, though instituted for the payment of old, facilitates very\r\n      much the contracting of new debts. It is a subsidiary fund, always at\r\n      hand, to be mortgaged in aid of any other doubtful fund, upon which money\r\n      is proposed to be raised in any exigency of the state. Whether the sinking\r\n      fund of Great Britain has been more frequently applied to the one or to the\r\n      other of those two purposes, will sufficiently appear by and by.\r\n\r\n      Besides those two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by a\r\n      perpetual funding, there are two other methods, which hold a sort of\r\n      middle place between them; these are, that of borrowing upon annuities for\r\n      terms of years, and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives.\r\n\r\n      During the reigns of king William and queen Anne, large sums were\r\n      frequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were\r\n      sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. In 1695, an act was passed for\r\n      borrowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent., or £140,000\r\n      a-year, for sixteen years. In 1691, an act was passed for borrowing a\r\n      million upon annuities for lives, upon terms which, in the present times,\r\n      would appear very advantageous; but the subscription was not filled up. In\r\n      the following year, the deficiency was made good, by borrowing upon\r\n      annuities for lives, at fourteen per cent. or a little more than seven\r\n      years purchase. In 1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities\r\n      were allowed to exchange them for others of ninety-six years, upon paying\r\n      into the exchequer sixty-three pounds in the hundred; that is, the\r\n      difference between fourteen per cent. for life, and fourteen per cent. for\r\n      ninety-six years, was sold for sixty-three pounds, or for four and a-half\r\n      years purchase. Such was the supposed instability of government, that even\r\n      these terms procured few purchasers. In the reign of queen Anne, money\r\n      was, upon different occasions, borrowed both upon annuities for lives, and\r\n      upon annuities for terms of thirty-two, of eighty-nine, of ninety-eight,\r\n      and of ninety-nine years. In 1719, the proprietors of the annuities for\r\n      thirty-two years were induced to accept, in lieu of them, South-sea stock\r\n      to the amount of eleven and a-half years purchase of the annuities,\r\n      together with an additional quantity of stock, equal to the arrears which\r\n      happened then to be due upon them. In 1720, the greater part of the other\r\n      annuities for terms of years, both long and short, were subscribed into\r\n      the same fund. The long annuities, at that time, amounted to £666,821:\r\n      8:3½ a-year. On the 5th of January 1775, the remainder of them, or what\r\n      was not subscribed at that time, amounted only to £136,453:12:8d.\r\n\r\n      During the two wars which began in 1739 and in 1755, little money was\r\n      borrowed, either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for\r\n      lives. An annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth\r\n      nearly as much as a perpetuity, and should therefore, one might think, be\r\n      a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order to make\r\n      family settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into the\r\n      public stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value was\r\n      continually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable\r\n      proportion, both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity\r\n      for a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be\r\n      very nearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find\r\n      nearly the same number of purchasers. The subscribers to a new loan, who\r\n      mean generally to sell their subscription as soon as possible, prefer\r\n      greatly a perpetual annuity, redeemable by parliament, to an irredeemable\r\n      annuity, for a long term of years, of only equal amount. The value of the\r\n      former may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same; and it\r\n      makes, therefore, a more convenient transferable stock than the latter.\r\n\r\n      During the two last-mentioned wars, annuities, either for terms of years\r\n      or for lives, were seldom granted, but as premiums to the subscribers of a\r\n      new loan, over and above the redeemable annuity or interest, upon the\r\n      credit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They were granted, not\r\n      as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed, but as an additional\r\n      encouragement to the lender.\r\n\r\n      Annuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different ways;\r\n      either upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which, in French, are\r\n      called tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are\r\n      granted upon separate lives, the death of every individual annuitant\r\n      disburdens the public revenue, so far as it was affected by his annuity.\r\n      When annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public\r\n      revenue does not commence till the death of all the annuitants\r\n      comprehended in one lot, which may sometimes consist of twenty or thirty\r\n      persons, of whom the survivors succeed to the annuities of all those who\r\n      die before them; the last survivor succeeding to the annuities of the\r\n      whole lot. Upon the same revenue, more money can always be raised by\r\n      tontines than by annuities for separate lives. An annuity, with a right of\r\n      survivorship, is really worth more than an equal annuity for a separate\r\n      life; and, from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own\r\n      good fortune, the principle upon which is founded the success of all\r\n      lotteries, such an annuity generally sells for something more than it is\r\n      worth. In countries where it is usual for government to raise money by\r\n      granting annuities, tontines are, upon this account, generally preferred\r\n      to annuities for separate lives. The expedient which will raise most\r\n      money, is almost always preferred to that which is likely to bring about,\r\n      in the speediest manner, the liberation of the public revenue.\r\n\r\n      In France, a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in\r\n      annuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by\r\n      the parliament of Bourdeaux to the king, in 1764, the whole public debt of\r\n      France is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres; of which\r\n      the capital, for which annuities for lives had been granted, is supposed\r\n      to amount to three hundred millions, the eighth part of the whole public\r\n      debt. The annuities themselves are computed to amount to thirty millions\r\n      a-year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions, the supposed\r\n      interest of that whole debt. These estimations, I know very well, are not\r\n      exact; but having been presented by so very respectable a body as\r\n      approximations to the truth, they may, I apprehend, be considered as such.\r\n      It is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of\r\n      France and England for the liberation of the public revenue, which\r\n      occasions this difference in their respective modes of borrowing; it\r\n      arises altogether from the different views and interests of the lenders.\r\n\r\n      In England, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile city\r\n      in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance money to\r\n      government. By advancing it, they do not mean to diminish, but, on the\r\n      contrary, to increase their mercantile capitals; and unless they expected\r\n      to sell, with some profit, their share in the subscription for a new loan,\r\n      they never would subscribe. But if, by advancing their money, they were to\r\n      purchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only,\r\n      whether their own or those of other people, they would not always be so\r\n      likely to sell them with a profit. Annuities upon their own lives they\r\n      would always sell with loss; because no man will give for an annuity upon\r\n      the life of another, whose age and state of health are nearly the same\r\n      with his own, the same price which he would give for one upon his own. An\r\n      annuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal\r\n      value to the buyer and the seller; but its real value begins to diminish\r\n      from the moment it is granted, and continues to do so, more and more, as\r\n      long as it subsists. It can never, therefore, make so convenient a\r\n      transferable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be\r\n      supposed always the same, or very nearly the same.\r\n\r\n      In France, the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city,\r\n      merchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance\r\n      money to government. The people concerned in the finances, the\r\n      farmers-general, the receivers of the taxes which are not in farm, the\r\n      court-bankers, etc. make the greater part of those who advance their money\r\n      in all public exigencies. Such people are commonly men of mean birth, but\r\n      of great wealth, and frequently of great pride. They are too proud to\r\n      marry their equals, and women of quality disdain to marry them. They\r\n      frequently resolve, therefore, to live bachelors; and having neither any\r\n      families of their own, nor much regard for those of their relations, whom\r\n      they are not always very fond of acknowledging, they desire only to live\r\n      in splendour during their own time, and are not unwilling that their\r\n      fortune should end with themselves. The number of rich people, besides,\r\n      who are either averse to marry, or whose condition of life renders it\r\n      either improper or inconvenient for them to do so, is much greater in\r\n      France than in England. To such people, who have little or no care for\r\n      posterity, nothing can be more convenient than to exchange their capital\r\n      for a revenue, which is to last just as long, and no longer, than they\r\n      wish it to do.\r\n\r\n      The ordinary expense of the greater part of modern governments, in time of\r\n      peace, being equal, or nearly equal, to their ordinary revenue, when war\r\n      comes, they are both unwilling and unable to increase their revenue in\r\n      proportion to the increase of their expense. They are unwilling, for fear\r\n      of offending the people, who, by so great and so sudden an increase of\r\n      taxes, would soon be disgusted with the war; and they are unable, from not\r\n      well knowing what taxes would be sufficient to produce the revenue wanted.\r\n      The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment which this\r\n      fear and inability would otherwise occasion. By means of borrowing, they\r\n      are enabled, with a very moderate increase of taxes, to raise, from year\r\n      to year, money sufficient for carrying on the war; and by the practice of\r\n      perpetual funding, they are enabled, with the smallest possible increase\r\n      of taxes, to raise annually the largest possible sum of money. In great\r\n      empires, the people who live in the capital, and in the provinces remote\r\n      from the scene of action, feel, many of them, scarce any inconveniency\r\n      from the war, but enjoy, at their ease, the amusement of reading in the\r\n      newspapers the exploits of their own fleets and armies. To them this\r\n      amusement compensates the small difference between the taxes which they\r\n      pay on account of the war, and those which they had been accustomed to pay\r\n      in time of peace. They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace,\r\n      which puts an end to their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of\r\n      conquest and national glory, from a longer continuance of the war.\r\n\r\n      The return of peace, indeed, seldom relieves them from the greater part of\r\n      the taxes imposed during the war. These are mortgaged for the interest of\r\n      the debt contracted, in order to carry it on. If, over and above paying\r\n      the interest of this debt, and defraying the ordinary expense of\r\n      government, the old revenue, together with the new taxes, produce some\r\n      surplus revenue, it may, perhaps, be converted into a sinking fund for\r\n      paying off the debt. But, in the first place, this sinking fund, even\r\n      supposing it should be applied to no other purpose, is generally\r\n      altogether inadequate for paying, in the course of any period during which\r\n      it can reasonably be expected that peace should continue, the whole debt\r\n      contracted during the war; and, in the second place, this fund is almost\r\n      always applied to other purposes.\r\n\r\n      The new taxes were imposed for the sole purpose of paying the interest of\r\n      the money borrowed upon them. If they produce more, it is generally\r\n      something which was neither intended nor expected, and is, therefore,\r\n      seldom very considerable. Sinking funds have generally arisen, not so much\r\n      from any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was necessary\r\n      for paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon them, as from a\r\n      subsequent reduction of that interest; that of Holland in 1655, and that\r\n      of the ecclesiastical state in 1685, were both formed in this manner.\r\n      Hence the usual insufficiency of such funds.\r\n\r\n      During the most profound peace, various events occur, which require an\r\n      extraordinary expense; and government finds it always more convenient to\r\n      defray this expense by misapplying the sinking fund, than by imposing a\r\n      new tax. Every new tax is immediately felt more or less by the people. It\r\n      occasions always some murmur, and meets with some opposition. The more\r\n      taxes may have been multiplied, the higher they may have been raised upon\r\n      every different subject of taxation; the more loudly the people complain\r\n      of every new tax, the more difficult it becomes, too, either to find out\r\n      new subjects of taxation, or to raise much higher the taxes already\r\n      imposed upon the old. A momentary suspension of the payment of debt is not\r\n      immediately felt by the people, and occasions neither murmur nor\r\n      complaint. To borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious and easy\r\n      expedient for getting out of the present difficulty. The more the public\r\n      debts may have been accumulated, the more necessary it may have become to\r\n      study to reduce them; the more dangerous, the more ruinous it may be to\r\n      misapply any part of the sinking fund; the less likely is the public debt\r\n      to be reduced to any considerable degree, the more likely, the more\r\n      certainly, is the sinking fund to be misapplied towards defraying all the\r\n      extraordinary expenses which occur in time of peace. When a nation is\r\n      already overburdened with taxes, nothing but the necessities of a new war,\r\n      nothing but either the animosity of national vengeance, or the anxiety for\r\n      national security, can induce the people to submit, with tolerable\r\n      patience, to a new tax. Hence the usual misapplication of the sinking\r\n      fund.\r\n\r\n      In Great Britain, from the time that we had first recourse to the ruinous\r\n      expedient of perpetual funding, the reduction of the public debt, in time\r\n      of peace, has never borne any proportion to its accumulation in time of\r\n      war. It was in the war which began in 1668, and was concluded by the\r\n      treaty of Ryswick, in 1697, that the foundation of the present enormous\r\n      debt of Great Britain was first laid.\r\n\r\n      On the 31st of December 1697, the public debts of Great Britain, funded\r\n      and unfunded, amounted to £21,515,742:13:8½. A great part of those debts\r\n      had been contracted upon short anticipations, and some part upon annuities\r\n      for lives; so that, before the 31st of December 1701, in less than four\r\n      years, there had partly been paid off; and partly reverted to the public,\r\n      the sum of £5,121,041:12:0¾d; a greater reduction of the public debt than\r\n      has ever since been brought about in so short a period of time. The\r\n      remaining debt, therefore, amounted only to £16,394,701:1:7¼d.\r\n\r\n      In the war which began in 1702, and which was concluded by the treaty of\r\n      Utrecht, the public debts were still more accumulated. On the 31st of\r\n      December 1714, they amounted to £53,681,076:5:6½. The subscription into\r\n      the South-sea fund, of the short and long annuities, increased the capital\r\n      of the public debt; so that, on the 31st of December 1722, it amounted to\r\n      £55,282,978:1:3 ⅚. The reduction of the debt began in 1723, and went on\r\n      so slowly, that, on the 31st of December 1739, during seventeen years-of\r\n      profound peace, the whole sum paid off was no more than £8,328,554:17:11\r\n      ³⁄₁₂, the capital of the public debt, at that time, amounting to\r\n      £46,954,623:3:4 ⁷⁄₁₂.\r\n\r\n      The Spanish war, which began in 1739, and the French war which soon\r\n      followed it, occasioned a further increase of the debt, which, on the 31st\r\n      of December 1748, after the war had been concluded by the treaty of\r\n      Aix-la-Chapelle, amounted to £78,293,313:1:10¾. The most profound peace,\r\n      of 17 years continuance, had taken no more than £8,328,354, 17:11¼ from\r\n      it. A war, of less than nine years continuance, added £31,338,689:18: 6\r\n      ⅙ to it. {See James Postlethwaite’s History of the Public Revenue.}\r\n\r\n      During the administration of Mr Pelham, the interest of the public debt\r\n      was reduced, or at least measures were taken for reducing it, from four to\r\n      three per cent.; the sinking fund was increased, and some part of the\r\n      public debt was paid off. In 1755, before the breaking out of the late\r\n      war, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to £72,289,675. On the 5th\r\n      of January 1763, at the conclusion of the peace, the funded debt amounted\r\n      debt to £122,603,336:8:2¼. The unfunded debt has been stated at\r\n      £13,927,589:2:2. But the expense occasioned by the war did not end with\r\n      the conclusion of the peace; so that, though on the 5th of January 1764,\r\n      the funded debt was increased (partly by a new loan, and partly by funding\r\n      a part of the unfunded debt) to £129,586,789:10:1¾, there still remained\r\n      (according to the very well informed author of Considerations on the Trade\r\n      and Finances of Great Britain) an unfunded debt, which was brought to\r\n      account in that and the following year, of £9,975,017: 12:2 ¹⁵⁄₄₄d. In\r\n      1764, therefore, the public debt of Great Britain, funded and unfunded\r\n      together, amounted, according to this author, to £139,561,807:2:4. The\r\n      annuities for lives, too, which had been granted as premiums to the\r\n      subscribers to the new loans in 1757, estimated at fourteen years\r\n      purchase, were valued at £472,500; and the annuities for long terms of\r\n      years, granted as premiums likewise, in 1761 and 1762, estimated at\r\n      twenty-seven and a-half years purchase, were valued at £6,826,875. During\r\n      a peace of about seven years continuance, the prudent and truly patriotic\r\n      administration of Mr Pelham was not able to pay off an old debt of six\r\n      millions. During a war of nearly the same continuance, a new debt of more\r\n      than seventy-five millions was contracted.\r\n\r\n      On the 5th of January 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to\r\n      £124,996,086, 1:6¼d. The unfunded, exclusive of a large civil-list debt,\r\n      to £4,150,236:3:11 ⅞. Both together, to £129,146,322:5:6. According to\r\n      this account, the whole debt paid off, during eleven years of profound\r\n      peace, amounted only to £10,415,476:16:9 ⅞. Even this small reduction of\r\n      debt, however, has not been all made from the savings out of the ordinary\r\n      revenue of the state. Several extraneous sums, altogether independent of\r\n      that ordinary revenue, have contributed towards it. Amongst these we may\r\n      reckon an additional shilling in the pound land tax, for three years; the\r\n      two millions received from the East-India company, as indemnification for\r\n      their territorial acquisitions; and the one hundred and ten thousand\r\n      pounds received from the bank for the renewal of their charter. To these\r\n      must be added several other sums, which, as they arose out of the late\r\n      war, ought perhaps to be considered as deductions from the expenses of it.\r\n      The principal are,\r\n\r\n\r\n   The produce of French prizes..............    £690,449: 18: 9\r\n   Composition for French prisoners.........      670,000:  0: 0\r\n\r\n   What has been received from the sale\r\n   of the ceded islands.........................   95,500:  0: 0\r\n\r\n   Total, .....................................£1,455,949: 18: 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      If we add to this sum the balance of the earl of Chatham’s and Mr\r\n      Calcraft’s accounts, and other army savings of the same kind, together\r\n      with what has been received from the bank, the East-India company, and the\r\n      additional shilling in the pound land tax, the whole must be a good deal\r\n      more than five millions. The debt, therefore, which, since the peace, has\r\n      been paid out of the savings from the ordinary revenue of the state, has\r\n      not, one year with another, amounted to half a million a-year. The sinking\r\n      fund has, no doubt, been considerably augmented since the peace, by the\r\n      debt which had been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per\r\n      cents to three per cents, and by the annuities for lives which have fallen\r\n      in; and, if peace were to continue, a million, perhaps, might now be\r\n      annually spared out of it towards the discharge of the debt. Another\r\n      million, accordingly, was paid in the course of last year; but at the same\r\n      time, a large civil-list debt was left unpaid, and we are now involved in\r\n      a new war, which, in its progress, may prove as expensive as any of our\r\n      former wars. {It has proved more expensive than any one of our former\r\n      wars, and has involved us in an additional debt of more than one hundred\r\n      millions. During a profound peace of eleven years, little more than ten\r\n      millions of debt was paid; during a war of seven years, more than one\r\n      hundred millions was contracted.} The new debt which will probably be\r\n      contracted before the end of the next campaign, may, perhaps, be nearly\r\n      equal to all the old debt which has been paid off from the savings out of\r\n      the ordinary revenue of the state. It would be altogether chimerical,\r\n      therefore, to expect that the public debt should ever be completely\r\n      discharged, by any savings which are likely to be made from that ordinary\r\n      revenue as it stands at present.\r\n\r\n      The public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, particularly\r\n      those of England, have, by one author, been represented as the\r\n      accumulation of a great capital, superadded to the other capital of the\r\n      country, by means of which its trade is extended, its manufactures are\r\n      multiplied, and its lands cultivated and improved, much beyond what they\r\n      could have been by means of that other capital only. He does not consider\r\n      that the capital which the first creditors of the public advanced to\r\n      government, was, from the moment in which he advanced it, a certain\r\n      portion of the annual produce, turned away from serving in the function of\r\n      a capital, to serve in that of a revenue; from maintaining productive\r\n      labourers, to maintain unproductive ones, and to be spent and wasted,\r\n      generally in the course of the year, without even the hope of any future\r\n      reproduction. In return for the capital which they advanced, they\r\n      obtained, indeed, an annuity of the public funds, in most cases, of more\r\n      than equal value. This annuity, no doubt, replaced to them their capital,\r\n      and enabled them to carry on their trade and business to the same, or,\r\n      perhaps, to a greater extent than before; that is, they were enabled,\r\n      either to borrow of other people a new capital, upon the credit of this\r\n      annuity or, by selling it, to get from other people a new capital of their\r\n      own, equal, or superior, to that which they had advanced to government.\r\n      This new capital, however, which they in this manner either bought or\r\n      borrowed of other people, must have existed in the country before, and\r\n      must have been employed, as all capitals are, in maintaining productive\r\n      labour. When it came into the hands of those who had advanced their money\r\n      to government, though it was, in some respects, a new capital to them, it\r\n      was not so to the country, but was only a capital withdrawn from certain\r\n      employments, in order to be turned towards others. Though it replaced to\r\n      them what they had advanced to government, it did not replace it to the\r\n      country. Had they not advanced this capital to government, there would\r\n      have been in the country two capitals, two portions of the annual produce,\r\n      instead of one, employed in maintaining productive labour.\r\n\r\n      When, for defraying the expense of government, a revenue is raised within\r\n      the year, from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes, a certain portion\r\n      of the revenue of private people is only turned away from maintaining one\r\n      species of unproductive labour, towards maintaining another. Some part of\r\n      what they pay in those taxes, might, no doubt, have been accumulated into\r\n      capital, and consequently employed in maintaining productive labour; but\r\n      the greater part would probably have been spent, and consequently employed\r\n      in maintaining unproductive labour. The public expense, however, when\r\n      defrayed in this manner, no doubt hinders, more or less, the further\r\n      accumulation of new capital; but it does not necessarily occasion the\r\n      destruction of any actually-existing capital.\r\n\r\n      When the public expense is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by the\r\n      annual destruction of some capital which had before existed in the\r\n      country; by the perversion of some portion of the annual produce which had\r\n      before been destined for the maintenance of productive labour, towards\r\n      that of unproductive labour. As in this case, however, the taxes are\r\n      lighter than they would have been, had a revenue sufficient for defraying\r\n      the same expense been raised within the year; the private revenue of\r\n      individuals is necessarily less burdened, and consequently their ability\r\n      to save and accumulate some part of that revenue into capital, is a good\r\n      deal less impaired. If the method of funding destroys more old capital,\r\n      it, at the same time, hinders less the accumulation or acquisition of new\r\n      capital, than that of defraying the public expense by a revenue raised\r\n      within the year. Under the system of funding, the frugality and industry\r\n      of private people can more easily repair the breaches which the waste and\r\n      extravagance of government may occasionally make in the general capital of\r\n      the society.\r\n\r\n      It is only during the continuance of war, however, that the system of\r\n      funding has this advantage over the other system. Were the expense of war\r\n      to be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year, the taxes from\r\n      which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no longer than the\r\n      war. The ability of private people to accumulate, though less during the\r\n      war, would have been greater during the peace, than under the system of\r\n      funding. War would not necessarily have occasioned the destruction of any\r\n      old capitals, and peace would have occasioned the accumulation of many\r\n      more new. Wars would, in general, be more speedily concluded, and less\r\n      wantonly undertaken. The people feeling, during continuance of war, the\r\n      complete burden of it, would soon grow weary of it; and government, in\r\n      order to humour them, would not be under the necessity of carrying it on\r\n      longer than it was necessary to do so. The foresight of the heavy and\r\n      unavoidable burdens of war would hinder the people from wantonly calling\r\n      for it when there was no real or solid interest to fight for. The seasons\r\n      during which the ability of private people to accumulate was somewhat\r\n      impaired, would occur more rarely, and be of shorter continuance. Those,\r\n      on the contrary, during which that ability was in the highest vigour would\r\n      be of much longer duration than they can well be under the system of\r\n      funding.\r\n\r\n      When funding, besides, has made a certain progress, the multiplication of\r\n      taxes which it brings along with it, sometimes impairs as much the ability\r\n      of private people to accumulate, even in time of peace, as the other\r\n      system would in time of war. The peace revenue of Great Britain amounts at\r\n      present to more than ten millions a-year. If free and unmortgaged, it\r\n      might be sufficient, with proper management, and without contracting a\r\n      shilling of new debt, to carry on the most vigorous war. The private\r\n      revenue of the inhabitants of Great Britain is at present as much\r\n      incumbered in time of peace, their ability to accumulate is as much\r\n      impaired, as it would have been in the time of the most expensive war, had\r\n      the pernicious system of funding never been adopted.\r\n\r\n      In the payment of the interest of the public debt, it has been said, it is\r\n      the right hand which pays the left. The money does not go out of the\r\n      country. It is only a part of the revenue of one set of the inhabitants\r\n      which is transferred to another; and the nation is not a farthing the\r\n      poorer. This apology is founded altogether in the sophistry of the\r\n      mercantile system; and, after the long examination which I have already\r\n      bestowed upon that system, it may, perhaps, be unnecessary to say anything\r\n      further about it. It supposes, besides, that the whole public debt is\r\n      owing to the inhabitants of the country, which happens not to be true; the\r\n      Dutch, as well as several other foreign nations, having a very\r\n      considerable share in our public funds. But though the whole debt were\r\n      owing to the inhabitants of the country, it would not, upon that account,\r\n      be less pernicious.\r\n\r\n      Land and capital stock are the two original sources of all revenue, both\r\n      private and public. Capital stock pays the wages of productive labour,\r\n      whether employed in agriculture, manufactures, or commerce. The management\r\n      of those two original sources of revenue belongs to two different sets of\r\n      people; the proprietors of land, and the owners or employers of capital\r\n      stock.\r\n\r\n      The proprietor of land is interested, for the sake of his own revenue, to\r\n      keep his estate in as good condition as he can, by building and repairing\r\n      his tenants houses, by making and maintaining the necessary drains and\r\n      inclosures, and all those other expensive improvements which it properly\r\n      belongs to the landlord to make and maintain. But, by different land\r\n      taxes, the revenue of the landlord may be so much diminished, and, by\r\n      different duties upon the necessaries and conveniencies of life, that\r\n      diminished revenue may be rendered of so little real value, that he may\r\n      find himself altogether unable to make or maintain those expensive\r\n      improvements. When the landlord, however, ceases to do his part, it is\r\n      altogether impossible that the tenant should continue to do his. As the\r\n      distress of the landlord increases, the agriculture of the country must\r\n      necessarily decline.\r\n\r\n      When, by different taxes upon the necessaries and conveniencies of life,\r\n      the owners and employers of capital stock find, that whatever revenue they\r\n      derive from it, will not, in a particular country, purchase the same\r\n      quantity of those necessaries and conveniencies which an equal revenue\r\n      would in almost any other, they will be disposed to remove to some other.\r\n      And when, in order to raise those taxes, all or the greater part of\r\n      merchants and manufacturers, that is, all or the greater part of the\r\n      employers of great capitals, come to be continually exposed to the\r\n      mortifying and vexatious visits of the tax-gatherers, this disposition to\r\n      remove will soon be changed into an actual removing. The industry of the\r\n      country will necessarily fall with the removal of the capital which\r\n      supported it, and the ruin of trade and manufactures will follow the\r\n      declension of agriculture.\r\n\r\n      To transfer from the owners of those two great sources of revenue, land,\r\n      and capital stock, from the persons immediately interested in the good\r\n      condition of every particular portion of land, and in the good management\r\n      of every particular portion of capital stock, to another set of persons\r\n      (the creditors of the public, who have no such particular interest), the\r\n      greater part of the revenue arising from either, must, in the long-run,\r\n      occasion both the neglect of land, and the waste or removal of capital\r\n      stock. A creditor of the public has, no doubt, a general interest in the\r\n      prosperity of the agriculture, manufactures, and commerce of the country;\r\n      and consequently in the good condition of its land, and in the good\r\n      management of its capital stock. Should there be any general failure or\r\n      declension in any of these things, the produce of the different taxes\r\n      might no longer be sufficient to pay him the annuity or interest which is\r\n      due to him. But a creditor of the public, considered merely as such, has\r\n      no interest in the good condition of any particular portion of land, or in\r\n      the good management of any particular portion of capital stock. As a\r\n      creditor of the public, he has no knowledge of any such particular\r\n      portion. He has no inspection of it. He can have no care about it. Its\r\n      ruin may in some cases be unknown to him, and cannot directly affect him.\r\n\r\n      The practice of funding has gradually enfeebled every state which has\r\n      adopted it. The Italian republics seem to have begun it. Genoa and Venice,\r\n      the only two remaining which can pretend to an independent existence, have\r\n      both been enfeebled by it. Spain seems to have learned the practice from\r\n      the Italian republics, and (its taxes being probably less judicious than\r\n      theirs) it has, in proportion to its natural strength, been-still more\r\n      enfeebled. The debts of Spain are of very old standing. It was deeply in\r\n      debt before the end of the sixteenth century, about a hundred years before\r\n      England owed a shilling. France, notwithstanding all its natural\r\n      resources, languishes under an oppressive load of the same kind. The\r\n      republic of the United Provinces is as much enfeebled by its debts as\r\n      either Genoa or Venice. Is it likely that, in Great Britain alone, a\r\n      practice, which has brought either weakness or dissolution into every\r\n      other country, should prove altogether innocent?\r\n\r\n      The system of taxation established in those different countries, it may be\r\n      said, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is so. But it ought to\r\n      be remembered, that when the wisest government has exhausted all the\r\n      proper subjects of taxation, it must, in cases of urgent necessity, have\r\n      recourse to improper ones. The wise republic of Holland has, upon some\r\n      occasions, been obliged to have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the\r\n      greater part of those of Spain. Another war, begun before any considerable\r\n      liberation of the public revenue had been brought about, and growing in\r\n      its progress as expensive as the last war, may, from irresistible\r\n      necessity, render the British system of taxation as oppressive as that of\r\n      Holland, or even as that of Spain. To the honour of our present system of\r\n      taxation, indeed, it has hitherto given so little embarrassment to\r\n      industry, that, during the course even of the most expensive wars, the\r\n      frugality and good conduct of individuals seem to have been able, by\r\n      saving and accumulation, to repair all the breaches which the waste and\r\n      extravagance of government had made in the general capital of the society.\r\n      At the conclusion of the late war, the most expensive that Great Britain\r\n      ever waged, her agriculture was as flourishing, her manufacturers as\r\n      numerous and as fully employed, and her commerce as extensive, as they had\r\n      ever been before. The capital, therefore, which supported all those\r\n      different branches of industry, must have been equal to what it had ever\r\n      been before. Since the peace, agriculture has been still further improved;\r\n      the rents of houses have risen in every town and village of the country, a\r\n      proof of the increasing wealth and revenue of the people; and the annual\r\n      amount of the greater part of the old taxes, of the principal branches of\r\n      the excise and customs, in particular, has been continually increasing, an\r\n      equally clear proof of an increasing consumption, and consequently of an\r\n      increasing produce, which could alone support that consumption. Great\r\n      Britain seems to support with ease, a burden which, half a century ago,\r\n      nobody believed her capable of supporting, Let us not, however, upon this\r\n      account, rashly conclude that she is capable of supporting any burden; nor\r\n      even be too confident that she could support, without great distress, a\r\n      burden a little greater than what has already been laid upon her.\r\n\r\n      When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there\r\n      is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and\r\n      completely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if it has ever been\r\n      brought about at all, has always been brought about by a bankruptcy;\r\n      sometimes by an avowed one, though frequently by a pretended payment.\r\n\r\n      The raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual\r\n      expedient by which a real public bankruptcy has been disguised under the\r\n      appearance of a pretended payment. If a sixpence, for example, should,\r\n      either by act of parliament or royal proclamation, be raised to the\r\n      denomination of a shilling, and twenty sixpences to that of a pound\r\n      sterling; the person who, under the old denomination, had borrowed twenty\r\n      shillings, or near four ounces of silver, would, under the new, pay with\r\n      twenty sixpences, or with something less than two ounces. A national debt\r\n      of about a hundred and twenty-eight millions, near the capital of the\r\n      funded and unfunded debt of Great Britain, might, in this manner, be paid\r\n      with about sixty-four millions of our present money. It would, indeed, be\r\n      a pretended payment only, and the creditors of the public would really be\r\n      defrauded of ten shillings in the pound of what was due to them. The\r\n      calamity, too, would extend much further than to the creditors of the\r\n      public, and those of every private person would suffer a proportionable\r\n      loss; and this without any advantage, but in most cases with a great\r\n      additional loss, to the creditors of the public. If the creditors of the\r\n      public, indeed, were generally much in debt to other people, they might in\r\n      some measure compensate their loss by paying their creditors in the same\r\n      coin in which the public had paid them. But in most countries, the\r\n      creditors of the public are, the greater part of them, wealthy people, who\r\n      stand more in the relation of creditors than in that of debtors, towards\r\n      the rest of their fellow citizens. A pretended payment of this kind,\r\n      therefore, instead of alleviating, aggravates, in most cases, the loss of\r\n      the creditors of the public; and, without any advantage to the public,\r\n      extends the calamity to a great number of other innocent people. It\r\n      occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of\r\n      private people; enriching, in most cases, the idle and profuse debtor, at\r\n      the expense of the industrious and frugal creditor; and transporting a\r\n      great part of the national capital from the hands which were likely to\r\n      increase and improve it, to those who are likely to dissipate and destroy\r\n      it. When it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself bankrupt, in\r\n      the same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a\r\n      fair, open, and avowed bankruptcy, is always the measure which is both\r\n      least dishonourable to the debtor, and least hurtful to the creditor. The\r\n      honour of a state is surely very poorly provided for, when, in order to\r\n      cover the disgrace of a real bankruptcy, it has recourse to a juggling\r\n      trick of this kind, so easily seen through, and at the same time so\r\n      extremely pernicious.\r\n\r\n      Almost all states, however, ancient as well as modern, when reduced to\r\n      this necessity, have, upon some occasions, played this very juggling\r\n      trick. The Romans, at the end of the first Punic war, reduced the As, the\r\n      coin or denomination by which they computed the value of all their other\r\n      coins, from containing twelve ounces of copper, to contain only two\r\n      ounces; that is, they raised two ounces of copper to a denomination which\r\n      had always before expressed the value of twelve ounces. The republic was,\r\n      in this manner, enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted\r\n      with the sixth part of what it really owed. So sudden and so great a\r\n      bankruptcy, we should in the present times be apt to imagine, must have\r\n      occasioned a very violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have\r\n      occasioned any. The law which enacted it was, like all other laws relating\r\n      to the coin, introduced and carried through the assembly of the people by\r\n      a tribune, and was probably a very popular law. In Rome, as in all other\r\n      ancient republics, the poor people were constantly in debt to the rich and\r\n      the great, who, in order to secure their votes at the annual elections,\r\n      used to lend them money at exorbitant interest, which, being never paid,\r\n      soon accumulated into a sum too great either for the debtor to pay, or for\r\n      any body else to pay for him. The debtor, for fear of a very severe\r\n      execution, was obliged, without any further gratuity, to vote for the\r\n      candidate whom the creditor recommended. In spite of all the laws against\r\n      bribery and corruption, the bounty of the candidates, together with the\r\n      occasional distributions of coin which were ordered by the senate, were\r\n      the principal funds from which, during the latter times of the Roman\r\n      republic, the poorer citizens derived their subsistence. To deliver\r\n      themselves from this subjection to their creditors, the poorer citizens\r\n      were continually calling out, either for an entire abolition of debts, or\r\n      for what they called new tables; that is, for a law which should entitle\r\n      them to a complete acquittance, upon paying only a certain proportion of\r\n      their accumulated debts. The law which reduced the coin of all\r\n      denominations to a sixth part of its former value, as it enabled them to\r\n      pay their debts with a sixth part of what they really owed, was equivalent\r\n      to the most advantageous new tables. In order to satisfy the people, the\r\n      rich and the great were, upon several different occasions, obliged to\r\n      consent to laws, both for abolishing debts, and for introducing new\r\n      tables; and they probably were induced to consent to this law, partly for\r\n      the same reason, and partly that, by liberating the public revenue, they\r\n      might restore vigour to that government, of which they themselves had the\r\n      principal direction. An operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt\r\n      of £128,000,000 to £21,333,333:6:8. In the course of the second Punic war,\r\n      the As was still further reduced, first, from two ounces of copper to one\r\n      ounce, and afterwards from one ounce to half an ounce; that is, to the\r\n      twenty-fourth part of its original value. By combining the three Roman\r\n      operations into one, a debt of a hundred and twenty-eight millions of our\r\n      present money, might in this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of\r\n      £5,333,333:6:8. Even the enormous debt of Great Britain might in this\r\n      manner soon be paid.\r\n\r\n      By means of such expedients, the coin of, I believe, all nations, has been\r\n      gradually reduced more and more below its original value, and the same\r\n      nominal sum has been gradually brought to contain a smaller and a smaller\r\n      quantity of silver.\r\n\r\n      Nations have sometimes, for the same purpose, adulterated the standard of\r\n      their coin; that is, have mixed a greater quantity of alloy in it. If in\r\n      the pound weight of our silver coin, for example, instead of eighteen\r\n      penny-weight, according to the present standard, there were mixed eight\r\n      ounces of alloy; a pound sterling, or twenty shillings of such coin, would\r\n      be worth little more than six shillings and eightpence of our present\r\n      money. The quantity of silver contained in six shillings and eightpence of\r\n      our present money, would thus be raised very nearly to the denomination of\r\n      a pound sterling. The adulteration of the standard has exactly the same\r\n      effect with what the French call an augmentation, or a direct raising of\r\n      the denomination of the coin.\r\n\r\n      An augmentation, or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin,\r\n      always is, and from its nature must be, an open and avowed operation. By\r\n      means of it, pieces of a smaller weight and bulk are called by the same\r\n      name, which had before been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk.\r\n      The adulteration of the standard, on the contrary, has generally been a\r\n      concealed operation. By means of it, pieces are issued from the mint, of\r\n      the same denomination, and, as nearly as could be contrived, of the same\r\n      weight, bulk, and appearance, with pieces which had been current before of\r\n      much greater value. When king John of France, {See Du Cange Glossary, voce\r\n      Moneta; the Benedictine Edition.} in order to pay his debts, adulterated\r\n      his coin, all the officers of his mint were sworn to secrecy. Both\r\n      operations are unjust. But a simple augmentation is an injustice of open\r\n      violence; whereas an adulteration is an injustice of treacherous fraud.\r\n      This latter operation, therefore, as soon as it has been discovered, and\r\n      it could never be concealed very long, has always excited much greater\r\n      indignation than the former. The coin, after any considerable\r\n      augmentation, has very seldom been brought back to its former weight; but\r\n      after the greatest adulterations, it has almost always been brought back\r\n      to its former fineness. It has scarce ever happened, that the fury and\r\n      indignation of the people could otherwise be appeased.\r\n\r\n      In the end of the reign of Henry VIII., and in the beginning of that of\r\n      Edward VI., the English coin was not only raised in its denomination, but\r\n      adulterated in its standard. The like frauds were practised in Scotland\r\n      during the minority of James VI. They have occasionally been practised in\r\n      most other countries.\r\n\r\n      That the public revenue of Great Britain can never be completely\r\n      liberated, or even that any considerable progress can ever be made towards\r\n      that liberation, while the surplus of that revenue, or what is over and\r\n      above defraying the annual expense of the peace establishment, is so very\r\n      small, it seems altogether in vain to expect. That liberation, it is\r\n      evident, can never be brought about, without either some very considerable\r\n      augmentation of the public revenue, or some equally considerable reduction\r\n      of the public expense.\r\n\r\n      A more equal land tax, a more equal tax upon the rent of houses, and such\r\n      alterations in the present system of customs and excise as those which\r\n      have been mentioned in the foregoing chapter, might, perhaps, without\r\n      increasing the burden of the greater part of the people, but only\r\n      distributing the weight of it more equally upon the whole, produce a\r\n      considerable augmentation of revenue. The most sanguine projector,\r\n      however, could scarce flatter himself, that any augmentation of this kind\r\n      would be such as could give any reasonable hopes, either of liberating the\r\n      public revenue altogether, or even of making such progress towards that\r\n      liberation in time of peace, as either to prevent or to compensate the\r\n      further accumulation of the public debt in the next war.\r\n\r\n      By extending the British system of taxation to all the different provinces\r\n      of the empire, inhabited by people either of British or European\r\n      extraction, a much greater augmentation of revenue might be expected.\r\n      This, however, could scarce, perhaps, be done, consistently with the\r\n      principles of the British constitution, without admitting into the British\r\n      parliament, or, if you will, into the states-general of the British\r\n      empire, a fair and equal representation of all those different provinces;\r\n      that of each province bearing the same proportion to the produce of its\r\n      taxes, as the representation of Great Britain might bear to the produce of\r\n      the taxes levied upon Great Britain. The private interest of many powerful\r\n      individuals, the confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people, seem,\r\n      indeed, at present, to oppose to so great a change, such obstacles as it\r\n      may be very difficult, perhaps altogether impossible, to surmount.\r\n      Without, however, pretending to determine whether such a union be\r\n      practicable or impracticable, it may not, perhaps, be improper, in a\r\n      speculative work of this kind, to consider how far the British system of\r\n      taxation might be applicable to all the different provinces of the empire;\r\n      what revenue might be expected from it, if so applied; and in what manner\r\n      a general union of this kind might be likely to affect the happiness and\r\n      prosperity of the different provinces comprehended within it. Such a\r\n      speculation, can, at worst, be regarded but as a new Utopia, less amusing,\r\n      certainly, but no more useless and chimerical than the old one.\r\n\r\n      The land-tax, the stamp duties, and the different duties of customs and\r\n      excise, constitute the four principal branches of the British taxes.\r\n\r\n      Ireland is certainly as able, and our American and West India plantations\r\n      more able, to pay a land tax, than Great Britain. Where the landlord is\r\n      subject neither to tythe nor poor’s rate, he must certainly be more able\r\n      to pay such a tax, than where he is subject to both those other burdens.\r\n      The tythe, where there is no modus, and where it is levied in kind,\r\n      diminishes more what would otherwise be the rent of the landlord, than a\r\n      land tax which really amounted to five shillings in the pound. Such a\r\n      tythe will be found, in most cases, to amount to more than a fourth part\r\n      of the real rent of the land, or of what remains after replacing\r\n      completely the capital of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit.\r\n      If all moduses and all impropriations were taken away, the complete church\r\n      tythe of Great Britain and Ireland could not well be estimated at less\r\n      than six or seven millions. If there was no tythe either in Great Britain\r\n      or Ireland, the landlords could afford to pay six or seven millions\r\n      additional land tax, without being more burdened than a very great part of\r\n      them are at present. America pays no tythe, and could, therefore, very\r\n      well afford to pay a land tax. The lands in America and the West Indies,\r\n      indeed, are, in general, not tenanted nor leased out to farmers. They\r\n      could not, therefore, be assessed according to any rent roll. But neither\r\n      were the lands of Great Britain, in the 4th of William and Mary, assessed\r\n      according to any rent roll, but according to a very loose and inaccurate\r\n      estimation. The lands in America might be assessed either in the same\r\n      manner, or according to an equitable valuation, in consequence of an\r\n      accurate survey, like that which was lately made in the Milanese, and in\r\n      the dominions of Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia.\r\n\r\n      Stamp duties, it is evident, might be levied without any variation, in all\r\n      countries where the forms of law process, and the deeds by which property,\r\n      both real and personal, is transferred, are the same, or nearly the same.\r\n\r\n      The extension of the custom-house laws of Great Britain to Ireland and the\r\n      plantations, provided it was accompanied, as in justice it ought to be,\r\n      with an extension of the freedom of trade, would be in the highest degree\r\n      advantageous to both. All the invidious restraints which at present\r\n      oppress the trade of Ireland, the distinction between the enumerated and\r\n      non-enumerated commodities of America, would be entirely at an end. The\r\n      countries north of Cape Finisterre would be as open to every part of the\r\n      produce of America, as those south of that cape are to some parts of that\r\n      produce at present. The trade between all the different parts of the\r\n      British empire would, in consequence of this uniformity in the\r\n      custom-house laws, be as free as the coasting trade of Great Britain is at\r\n      present. The British empire would thus afford, within itself, an immense\r\n      internal market for every part of the produce of all its different\r\n      provinces. So great an extension of market would soon compensate, both to\r\n      Ireland and the plantations, all that they could suffer from the increase\r\n      of the duties of customs.\r\n\r\n      The excise is the only part of the British system of taxation, which would\r\n      require to be varied in any respect, according as it was applied to the\r\n      different provinces of the empire. It might be applied to Ireland without\r\n      any variation; the produce and consumption of that kingdom being exactly\r\n      of the same nature with those of Great Britain. In its application to\r\n      America and the West Indies, of which the produce and consumption are so\r\n      very different from those of Great Britain, some modification might be\r\n      necessary, in the same manner as in its application to the cyder and beer\r\n      counties of England.\r\n\r\n      A fermented liquor, for example, which is called beer, but which, as it is\r\n      made of molasses, bears very little resemblance to our beer, makes a\r\n      considerable part of the common drink of the people in America. This\r\n      liquor, as it can be kept only for a few days, cannot, like our beer, be\r\n      prepared and stored up for sale in great breweries; but every private\r\n      family must brew it for their own use, in the same manner as they cook\r\n      their victuals. But to subject every private family to the odious visits\r\n      and examination of the tax-gatherers, in the same manner as we subject the\r\n      keepers of ale-houses and the brewers for public sale, would be altogether\r\n      inconsistent with liberty. If, for the sake of equality, it was thought\r\n      necessary to lay a tax upon this liquor, it might be taxed by taxing the\r\n      material of which it is made, either at the place of manufacture, or, if\r\n      the circumstances of the trade rendered such an excise improper, by laying\r\n      a duty upon its importation into the colony in which it was to be\r\n      consumed. Besides the duty of one penny a-gallon imposed by the British\r\n      parliament upon the importation of molasses into America, there is a\r\n      provincial tax of this kind upon their importation into Massachusetts Bay,\r\n      in ships belonging to any other colony, of eight-pence the hogshead; and\r\n      another upon their importation from the northern colonies into South\r\n      Carolina, of five-pence the gallon. Or, if neither of these methods was\r\n      found convenient, each family might compound for its consumption of this\r\n      liquor, either according to the number of persons of which it consisted,\r\n      in the same manner as private families compound for the malt tax in\r\n      England; or according to the different ages and sexes of those persons, in\r\n      the same manner as several different taxes are levied in Holland; or,\r\n      nearly as Sir Matthew Decker proposes, that all taxes upon consumable\r\n      commodities should be levied in England. This mode of taxation, it has\r\n      already been observed, when applied to objects of a speedy consumption, is\r\n      not a very convenient one. It might be adopted, however, in cases where no\r\n      better could be done.\r\n\r\n      Sugar, rum, and tobacco, are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of\r\n      life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which\r\n      are, therefore, extremely proper subjects of taxation. If a union with the\r\n      colonies were to take place, those commodities might be taxed, either\r\n      before they go out of the hands of the manufacturer or grower; or, if this\r\n      mode of taxation did not suit the circumstances of those persons, they\r\n      might be deposited in public warehouses, both at the place of manufacture,\r\n      and at all the different ports of the empire, to which they might\r\n      afterwards be transported, to remain there, under the joint custody of the\r\n      owner and the revenue officer, till such time as they should be delivered\r\n      out, either to the consumer, to the merchant-retailer for home\r\n      consumption, or to the merchant-exporter; the tax not to be advanced till\r\n      such delivery. When delivered out for exportation, to go duty-free, upon\r\n      proper security being given, that they should really be exported out of\r\n      the empire. These are, perhaps, the principal commodities, with regard to\r\n      which the union with the colonies might require some considerable change\r\n      in the present system of British taxation.\r\n\r\n      What might be the amount of the revenue which this system of taxation,\r\n      extended to all the different provinces of the empire, might produce, it\r\n      must, no doubt, be altogether impossible to ascertain with tolerable\r\n      exactness. By means of this system, there is annually levied in Great\r\n      Britain, upon less than eight millions of people, more than ten millions\r\n      of revenue. Ireland contains more than two millions of people, and,\r\n      according to the accounts laid before the congress, the twelve associated\r\n      provinces of America contain more than three. Those accounts, however, may\r\n      have been exaggerated, in order, perhaps, either to encourage their own\r\n      people, or to intimidate those of this country; and we shall suppose,\r\n      therefore, that our North American and West Indian colonies, taken\r\n      together, contain no more than three millions; or that the whole British\r\n      empire, in Europe and America, contains no more than thirteen millions of\r\n      inhabitants. If, upon less than eight millions of inhabitants, this system\r\n      of taxation raises a revenue of more than ten millions sterling; it ought,\r\n      upon thirteen millions of inhabitants, to raise a revenue of more than\r\n      sixteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. From this\r\n      revenue, supposing that this system could produce it, must be deducted the\r\n      revenue usually raised in Ireland and the plantations, for defraying the\r\n      expense of the respective civil governments. The expense of the civil and\r\n      military establishment of Ireland, together with the interest of the\r\n      public debt, amounts, at a medium of the two years which ended March 1775,\r\n      to something less than seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year. By\r\n      a very exact account of the revenue of the principal colonies of America\r\n      and the West Indies, it amounted, before the commencement of the present\r\n      disturbances, to a hundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred pounds. In\r\n      this account, however, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina, and of\r\n      all our late acquisitions, both upon the continent, and in the islands, is\r\n      omitted; which may, perhaps, make a difference of thirty or forty thousand\r\n      pounds. For the sake of even numbers, therefore, let us suppose that the\r\n      revenue necessary for supporting the civil government of Ireland and the\r\n      plantations may amount to a million. There would remain, consequently, a\r\n      revenue of fifteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, to be\r\n      applied towards defraying the general expense of the empire, and towards\r\n      paying the public debt. But if, from the present revenue of Great Britain,\r\n      a million could, in peaceable times, be spared towards the payment of that\r\n      debt, six millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds could very well\r\n      be spared from this improved revenue. This great sinking fund, too, might\r\n      be augmented every year by the interest of the debt which had been\r\n      discharged the year before; and might, in this manner, increase so very\r\n      rapidly, as to be sufficient in a few years to discharge the whole debt,\r\n      and thus to restore completely the at-present debilitated and languishing\r\n      vigour of the empire. In the meantime, the people might be relieved from\r\n      some of the most burdensome taxes; from those which are imposed either\r\n      upon the necessaries of life, or upon the materials of manufacture. The\r\n      labouring poor would thus be enabled to live better, to work cheaper, and\r\n      to send their goods cheaper to market. The cheapness of their goods would\r\n      increase the demand for them, and consequently for the labour of those who\r\n      produced them. This increase in the demand for labour would both increase\r\n      the numbers, and improve the circumstances of the labouring poor. Their\r\n      consumption would increase, and, together with it, the revenue arising\r\n      from all those articles of their consumption upon which the taxes might be\r\n      allowed to remain.\r\n\r\n      The revenue arising from this system of taxation, however, might not\r\n      immediately increase in proportion to the number of people who were\r\n      subjected to it. Great indulgence would for some time be due to those\r\n      provinces of the empire which were thus subjected to burdens to which they\r\n      had not before been accustomed; and even when the same taxes came to be\r\n      levied everywhere as exactly as possible, they would not everywhere\r\n      produce a revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people. In a poor\r\n      country, the consumption of the principal commodities subject to the\r\n      duties of customs and excise, is very small; and in a thinly inhabited\r\n      country, the opportunities of smuggling are very great. The consumption of\r\n      malt liquors among the inferior ranks of people in Scotland is very small;\r\n      and the excise upon malt, beer, and ale, produces less there than in\r\n      England, in proportion to the numbers of the people and the rate of the\r\n      duties, which upon malt is different, on account of a supposed difference\r\n      of quality. In these particular branches of the excise, there is not, I\r\n      apprehend, much more smuggling in the one country than in the other. The\r\n      duties upon the distillery, and the greater part of the duties of customs,\r\n      in proportion to the numbers of people in the respective countries,\r\n      produce less in Scotland than in England, not only on account of the\r\n      smaller consumption of the taxed commodities, but of the much greater\r\n      facility of smuggling. In Ireland, the inferior ranks of people are still\r\n      poorer than in Scotland, and many parts of the country are almost as\r\n      thinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the consumption of the taxed\r\n      commodities might, in proportion to the number of the people, be still\r\n      less than in Scotland, and the facility of smuggling nearly the same. In\r\n      America and the West Indies, the white people, even of the lowest rank,\r\n      are in much better circumstances than those of the same rank in England;\r\n      and their consumption of all the luxuries in which they usually indulge\r\n      themselves, is probably much greater. The blacks, indeed, who make the\r\n      greater part of the inhabitants, both of the southern colonies upon the\r\n      continent and of the West India islands, as they are in a state of\r\n      slavery, are, no doubt, in a worse condition than the poorest people\r\n      either in Scotland or Ireland. We must not, however, upon that account,\r\n      imagine that they are worse fed, or that their consumption of articles\r\n      which might be subjected to moderate duties, is less than that even of the\r\n      lower ranks of people in England. In order that they may work well, it is\r\n      the interest of their master that they should be fed well, and kept in\r\n      good heart, in the same manner as it is his interest that his working\r\n      cattle should be so. The blacks, accordingly, have almost everywhere their\r\n      allowance of rum, and of molasses or spruce-beer, in the same manner as\r\n      the white servants; and this allowance would not probably be withdrawn,\r\n      though those articles should be subjected to moderate duties. The\r\n      consumption of the taxed commodities, therefore, in proportion to the\r\n      number of inhabitants, would probably be as great in America and the West\r\n      Indies as in any part of the British empire. The opportunities of\r\n      smuggling, indeed, would be much greater; America, in proportion to the\r\n      extent of the country, being much more thinly inhabited than either\r\n      Scotland or Ireland. If the revenue, however, which is at present raised\r\n      by the different duties upon malt and malt liquors, were to be levied by a\r\n      single duty upon malt, the opportunity of smuggling in the most important\r\n      branch of the excise would be almost entirely taken away; and if the\r\n      duties of customs, instead of being imposed upon almost all the different\r\n      articles of importation, were confined to a few of the most general use\r\n      and consumption, and if the levying of those duties were subjected to the\r\n      excise laws, the opportunity of smuggling, though not so entirely taken\r\n      away, would be very much diminished. In consequence of those two\r\n      apparently very simple and easy alterations, the duties of customs and\r\n      excise might probably produce a revenue as great, in proportion to the\r\n      consumption of the most thinly inhabited province, as they do at present,\r\n      in proportion to that of the most populous.\r\n\r\n      The Americans, it has been said, indeed, have no gold or silver money, the\r\n      interior commerce of the country being carried on by a paper currency; and\r\n      the gold and silver, which occasionally come among them, being all sent to\r\n      Great Britain, in return for the commodities which they receive from us.\r\n      But without gold and silver, it is added, there is no possibility of\r\n      paying taxes. We already get all the gold and silver which they have. How\r\n      is it possible to draw from them what they have not?\r\n\r\n      The present scarcity of gold and silver money in America, is not the\r\n      effect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the people\r\n      there to purchase those metals. In a country where the wages of labour are\r\n      so much higher, and the price of provisions so much lower than in England,\r\n      the greater part of the people must surely have wherewithal to purchase a\r\n      greater quantity, if it were either necessary or convenient for them to do\r\n      so. The scarcity of those metals, therefore, must be the effect of choice,\r\n      and not of necessity.\r\n\r\n      It is for transacting either domestic or foreign business, that gold or\r\n      silver money is either necessary or convenient.\r\n\r\n      The domestic business of every country, it has been shewn in the second\r\n      book of this Inquiry, may, at least in peaceable times, be transacted by\r\n      means of a paper currency, with nearly the same degree of conveniency as\r\n      by gold and silver money. It is convenient for the Americans, who could\r\n      always employ with profit, in the improvement of their lands, a greater\r\n      stock than they can easily get, to save as much as possible the expense of\r\n      so costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver; and rather to\r\n      employ that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary for\r\n      purchasing those metals, in purchasing the instruments of trade, the\r\n      materials of clothing, several parts of household furniture, and the iron\r\n      work necessary for building and extending their settlements and\r\n      plantations; in purchasing not dead stock, but active and productive\r\n      stock. The colony governments find it for their interest to supply the\r\n      people with such a quantity of paper money as is fully sufficient, and\r\n      generally more than sufficient, for transacting their domestic business.\r\n      Some of those governments, that of Pennsylvania, particularly, derive a\r\n      revenue from lending this paper money to their subjects, at an interest of\r\n      so much per cent. Others, like that of Massachusetts Bay, advance, upon\r\n      extraordinary emergencies, a paper money of this kind for defraying the\r\n      public expense; and afterwards, when it suits the conveniency of the\r\n      colony, redeem it at the depreciated value to which it gradually falls. In\r\n      1747, {See Hutchinson’s History of Massachusetts Bay vol. ii. page 436 et\r\n      seq.} that colony paid in this manner the greater part of its public\r\n      debts, with the tenth part of the money for which its bills had been\r\n      granted. It suits the conveniency of the planters, to save the expense of\r\n      employing gold and silver money in their domestic transactions; and it\r\n      suits the conveniency of the colony governments, to supply them with a\r\n      medium, which, though attended with some very considerable disadvantages,\r\n      enables them to save that expense. The redundancy of paper money\r\n      necessarily banishes gold and silver from the domestic transactions of the\r\n      colonies, for the same reason that it has banished those metals from the\r\n      greater part of the domestic transactions in Scotland; and in both\r\n      countries, it is not the poverty, but the enterprizing and projecting\r\n      spirit of the people, their desire of employing all the stock which they\r\n      can get, as active and productive stock, which has occasioned this\r\n      redundancy of paper money.\r\n\r\n      In the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with Great\r\n      Britain, gold and silver are more or less employed, exactly in proportion\r\n      as they are more or less necessary. Where those metals are not necessary,\r\n      they seldom appear. Where they are necessary, they are generally found.\r\n\r\n      In the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies, the\r\n      British goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long\r\n      credit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain price.\r\n      It is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in gold and\r\n      silver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods\r\n      which his correspondents had sold to him, in some other sort of goods\r\n      which he might happen to deal in, than in money. Such a merchant would\r\n      have no occasion to keep any part of his stock by him unemployed, and in\r\n      ready money, for answering occasional demands. He could have, at all\r\n      times, a larger quantity of goods in his shop or warehouse, and he could\r\n      deal to a greater extent. But it seldom happens to be convenient for all\r\n      the correspondents of a merchant to receive payment for the goods which\r\n      they sell to him, in goods of some other kind which he happens to deal in.\r\n      The British merchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland, happen to be a\r\n      particular set of correspondents, to whom it is more convenient to receive\r\n      payment for the goods which they sell to those colonies in tobacco, than\r\n      in gold and silver. They expect to make a profit by the sale of the\r\n      tobacco; they could make none by that of the gold and silver. Gold and\r\n      silver, therefore, very seldom appear in the commerce between Great\r\n      Britain and the tobacco colonies. Maryland and Virginia have as little\r\n      occasion for those metals in their foreign, as in their domestic commerce.\r\n      They are said, accordingly, to have less gold and silver money than any\r\n      other colonies in America. They are reckoned, however, as thriving, and\r\n      consequently as rich, as any of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n      In the northern colonies, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, the four\r\n      governments of New England, etc. the value of their own produce which they\r\n      export to Great Britain is not equal to that of the manufactures which\r\n      they import for their own use, and for that of some of the other colonies,\r\n      to which they are the carriers. A balance, therefore, must be paid to the\r\n      mother-country in gold and silver and this balance they generally find.\r\n\r\n      In the sugar colonies, the value of the produce annually exported to Great\r\n      Britain is much greater than that of all the goods imported from thence.\r\n      If the sugar and rum annually sent to the mother-country were paid for in\r\n      those colonies, Great Britain would be obliged to send out, every year, a\r\n      very large balance in money; and the trade to the West Indies would, by a\r\n      certain species of politicians, be considered as extremely\r\n      disadvantageous. But it so happens, that many of the principal proprietors\r\n      of the sugar plantations reside in Great Britain. Their rents are remitted\r\n      to them in sugar and rum, the produce of their estates. The sugar and rum\r\n      which the West India merchants purchase in those colonies upon their own\r\n      account, are not equal in value to the goods which they annually sell\r\n      there. A balance, therefore, must necessarily be paid to them in gold and\r\n      silver, and this balance, too, is generally found.\r\n\r\n      The difficulty and irregularity of payment from the different colonies to\r\n      Great Britain, have not been at all in proportion to the greatness or\r\n      smallness of the balances which were respectively due from them. Payments\r\n      have, in general, been more regular from the northern than from the\r\n      tobacco colonies, though the former have generally paid a pretty large\r\n      balance in money, while the latter have either paid no balance, or a much\r\n      smaller one. The difficulty of getting payment from our different sugar\r\n      colonies has been greater or less in proportion, not so much to the extent\r\n      of the balances respectively due from them, as to the quantity of\r\n      uncultivated land which they contained; that is, to the greater or smaller\r\n      temptation which the planters have been under of over-trading, or of\r\n      undertaking the settlement and plantation of greater quantities of waste\r\n      land than suited the extent of their capitals. The returns from the great\r\n      island of Jamaica, where there is still much uncultivated land, have, upon\r\n      this account, been, in general, more irregular and uncertain than those\r\n      from the smaller islands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Christopher’s,\r\n      which have, for these many years, been completely cultivated, and have,\r\n      upon that account, afforded less field for the speculations of the\r\n      planter. The new acquisitions of Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincent’s, and\r\n      Dominica, have opened a new field for speculations of this kind; and the\r\n      returns from those islands have of late been as irregular and uncertain\r\n      as those from the great island of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n      It is not, therefore, the poverty of the colonies which occasions, in the\r\n      greater part of them, the present scarcity of gold and silver money. Their\r\n      great demand for active and productive stock makes it convenient for them\r\n      to have as little dead stock as possible, and disposes them, upon that\r\n      account, to content themselves with a cheaper, though less commodious\r\n      instrument of commerce, than gold and silver. They are thereby enabled to\r\n      convert the value of that gold and silver into the instruments of trade,\r\n      into the materials of clothing, into household furniture, and into the\r\n      iron work necessary for building and extending their settlements and\r\n      plantations. In those branches of business which cannot be transacted\r\n      without gold and silver money, it appears, that they can always find the\r\n      necessary quantity of those metals; and if they frequently do not find it,\r\n      their failure is generally the effect, not of their necessary poverty, but\r\n      of their unnecessary and excessive enterprise. It is not because they are\r\n      poor that their payments are irregular and uncertain, but because they are\r\n      too eager to become excessively rich. Though all that part of the produce\r\n      of the colony taxes, which was over and above what was necessary for\r\n      defraying the expense of their own civil and military establishments, were\r\n      to be remitted to Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have\r\n      abundantly wherewithal to purchase the requisite quantity of those metals.\r\n      They would in this case be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part of their\r\n      surplus produce, with which they now purchase active and productive stock,\r\n      for dead stock. In transacting their domestic business, they would be\r\n      obliged to employ a costly, instead of a cheap instrument of commerce; and\r\n      the expense of purchasing this costly instrument might damp somewhat the\r\n      vivacity and ardour of their excessive enterprise in the improvement of\r\n      land. It might not, however, be necessary to remit any part of the\r\n      American revenue in gold and silver. It might be remitted in bills drawn\r\n      upon, and accepted by, particular merchants or companies in Great Britain,\r\n      to whom a part of the surplus produce of America had been consigned, who\r\n      would pay into the treasury the American revenue in money, after having\r\n      themselves received the value of it in goods; and the whole business might\r\n      frequently be transacted without exporting a single ounce of gold or\r\n      silver from America.\r\n\r\n      It is not contrary to justice, that both Ireland and America should\r\n      contribute towards the discharge of the public debt of Great Britain. That\r\n      debt has been contracted in support of the government established by the\r\n      Revolution; a government to which the protestants of Ireland owe, not only\r\n      the whole authority which they at present enjoy in their own country, but\r\n      every security which they possess for their liberty, their property, and\r\n      their religion; a government to which several of the colonies of America\r\n      owe their present charters, and consequently their present constitution;\r\n      and to which all the colonies of America owe the liberty, security, and\r\n      property, which they have ever since enjoyed. That public debt has been\r\n      contracted in the defence, not of Great Britain alone, but of all the\r\n      different provinces of the empire. The immense debt contracted in the late\r\n      war in particular, and a great part of that contracted in the war before,\r\n      were both properly contracted in defence of America.\r\n\r\n      By a union with Great Britain, Ireland would gain, besides the freedom of\r\n      trade, other advantages much more important, and which would much more\r\n      than compensate any increase of taxes that might accompany that union. By\r\n      the union with England, the middling and inferior ranks of people in\r\n      Scotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy,\r\n      which had always before oppressed them. By a union with Great Britain, the\r\n      greater part of people of all ranks in Ireland would gain an equally\r\n      complete deliverance from a much more oppressive aristocracy; an\r\n      aristocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in the natural and\r\n      respectable distinctions of birth and fortune, but in the most odious of\r\n      all distinctions, those of religious and political prejudices;\r\n      distinctions which, more than any other, animate both the insolence of the\r\n      oppressors, and the hatred and indignation of the oppressed, and which\r\n      commonly render the inhabitants of the same country more hostile to one\r\n      another than those of different countries ever are. Without a union with\r\n      Great Britain, the inhabitants of Ireland are not likely, for many ages,\r\n      to consider themselves as one people.\r\n\r\n      No oppressive aristocracy has ever prevailed in the colonies. Even they,\r\n      however, would, in point of happiness and tranquillity, gain considerably\r\n      by a union with Great Britain. It would, at least, deliver them from those\r\n      rancourous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small\r\n      democracies, and which have so frequently divided the affections of their\r\n      people, and disturbed the tranquillity of their governments, in their form\r\n      so nearly democratical. In the case of a total separation from Great\r\n      Britain, which, unless prevented by a union of this kind, seems very\r\n      likely to take place, those factions would be ten times more virulent than\r\n      ever. Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the coercive\r\n      power of the mother-country had always been able to restrain those\r\n      factions from breaking out into any thing worse than gross brutality and\r\n      insult. If that coercive power were entirely taken away, they would\r\n      probably soon break out into open violence and bloodshed. In all great\r\n      countries which are united under one uniform government, the spirit of\r\n      party commonly prevails less in the remote provinces than in the centre of\r\n      the empire. The distance of those provinces from the capital, from the\r\n      principal seat of the great scramble of faction and ambition, makes them\r\n      enter less into the views of any of the contending parties, and renders\r\n      them more indifferent and impartial spectators of the conduct of all. The\r\n      spirit of party prevails less in Scotland than in England. In the case of\r\n      a union, it would probably prevail less in Ireland than in Scotland; and\r\n      the colonies would probably soon enjoy a degree of concord and unanimity,\r\n      at present unknown in any part of the British empire. Both Ireland and the\r\n      colonies, indeed, would be subjected to heavier taxes than any which they\r\n      at present pay. In consequence, however, of a diligent and faithful\r\n      application of the public revenue towards the discharge of the national\r\n      debt, the greater part of those taxes might not be of long continuance,\r\n      and the public revenue of Great Britain might soon be reduced to what was\r\n      necessary for maintaining a moderate peace-establishment.\r\n\r\n      The territorial acquisitions of the East India Company, the undoubted\r\n      right of the Crown, that is, of the state and people of Great Britain,\r\n      might be rendered another source of revenue, more abundant, perhaps, than\r\n      all those already mentioned. Those countries are represented as more\r\n      fertile, more extensive, and, in proportion to their extent, much richer\r\n      and more populous than Great Britain. In order to draw a great revenue\r\n      from them, it would not probably be necessary to introduce any new system\r\n      of taxation into countries which are already sufficiently, and more than\r\n      sufficiently, taxed. It might, perhaps, be more proper to lighten than to\r\n      aggravate the burden of those unfortunate countries, and to endeavour to\r\n      draw a revenue from them, not by imposing new taxes, but by preventing the\r\n      embezzlement and misapplication of the greater part of those which they\r\n      already pay.\r\n\r\n      If it should be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any\r\n      considerable augmentation of revenue from any of the resources above\r\n      mentioned, the only resource which can remain to her, is a diminution of\r\n      her expense. In the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public\r\n      revenue, though in both there may be still room for improvement, Great\r\n      Britain seems to be at least as economical as any of her neighbours. The\r\n      military establishment which she maintains for her own defence in time of\r\n      peace, is more moderate than that of any European state, which can pretend\r\n      to rival her either in wealth or in power. None of these articles,\r\n      therefore, seem to admit of any considerable reduction of expense. The\r\n      expense of the peace-establishment of the colonies was, before the\r\n      commencement of the present disturbances, very considerable, and is an\r\n      expense which may, and, if no revenue can be drawn from them, ought\r\n      certainly to be saved altogether. This constant expense in time of peace,\r\n      though very great, is insignificant in comparison with what the defence of\r\n      the colonies has cost us in time of war. The last war, which was\r\n      undertaken altogether on account of the colonies, cost Great Britain, it\r\n      has already been observed, upwards of ninety millions. The Spanish war of\r\n      1739 was principally undertaken on their account; in which, and in the\r\n      French war that was the consequence of it, Great Britain, spent upwards of\r\n      forty millions; a great part of which ought justly to be charged to the\r\n      colonies. In those two wars, the colonies cost Great Britain much more\r\n      than double the sum which the national debt amounted to before the\r\n      commencement of the first of them. Had it not been for those wars, that\r\n      debt might, and probably would by this time, have been completely paid;\r\n      and had it not been for the colonies, the former of those wars might not,\r\n      and the latter certainly would not, have been undertaken. It was because\r\n      the colonies were supposed to be provinces of the British Empire, that\r\n      this expense was laid out upon them. But countries which contribute\r\n      neither revenue nor military force towards the support of the empire,\r\n      cannot be considered as provinces. They may, perhaps, be considered as\r\n      appendages, as a sort of splendid and shewy equipage of the empire. But if\r\n      the empire can no longer support the expense of keeping up this equipage,\r\n      it ought certainly to lay it down; and if it cannot raise its revenue in\r\n      proportion to its expense, it ought at least to accommodate its expense to\r\n      its revenue. If the colonies, notwithstanding their refusal to submit to\r\n      British taxes, are still to be considered as provinces of the British\r\n      empire, their defence, in some future war, may cost Great Britain as great\r\n      an expense as it ever has done in any former war. The rulers of Great\r\n      Britain have, for more than a century past, amused the people with the\r\n      imagination that they possessed a great empire on the west side of the\r\n      Atlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only.\r\n      It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a\r\n      gold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which\r\n      continues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been\r\n      hitherto, is likely to cost, immense expense, without being likely to\r\n      bring any profit; for the effects of the monopoly of the colony trade, it\r\n      has been shewn, are to the great body of the people, mere loss instead of\r\n      profit. It is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this\r\n      golden dream, in which they have been indulging themselves, perhaps, as\r\n      well as the people; or that they should awake from it themselves, and\r\n      endeavour to awaken the people. If the project cannot be completed, it\r\n      ought to be given up. If any of the provinces of the British empire cannot\r\n      be made to contribute towards the support of the whole empire, it is\r\n      surely time that Great Britain should free herself from the expense of\r\n      defending those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of\r\n      their civil or military establishment in time of peace; and endeavour to\r\n      accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her\r\n      circumstances.",
