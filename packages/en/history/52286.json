The constitutional changes which it has experienced in\r\nthe six, or four, or two centuries of its existence have been neither\r\nfew nor slight. The Society living within its walls has reflected from\r\nage to age the social, religious, and intellectual conditions of the\r\nnation at large. Its many passing generations of teachers and students\r\nhave left behind them a wealth of traditions honourable or the reverse.\r\nYet it seems not impossible to combine in one volume a series of\r\nCollege histories. What happened in one College happened to some extent\r\nin all; and if, therefore, certain periods or subjects which are fully\r\ndealt with in one College are omitted in others, a single volume ought\r\nto be sufficient, not merely to narrate the salient features of the\r\nhistory of each individual College, but also to give an intelligible\r\npicture of College life generally at successive periods of time.\r\n\r\nThis is what the present volume seeks to do. Brasenose and Hertford\r\nchapters give a hint of the multiplicity of halls for Seculars out of\r\nwhich the Colleges grew; in Trinity and Worcester chapters we have\r\na glimpse of the houses for Regulars which for a while mated the\r\nColleges, but disappeared at the Reformation. In Queen’s College,\r\nearly social conditions are described; in New College, early studies.\r\nBalliol College gives prominence to the Renaissance movement; Corpus\r\nChristi to the consequent changes in studies. In Magdalen College\r\nwe see the divisions and fluctuations of opinions which followed\r\nthe Reformation; in S. John’s, the golden age of the early Stuarts;\r\nin Merton, the dissensions of the Civil War; in Exeter College, the\r\nstrong contrast between Commonwealth and Restoration. University\r\nCollege naturally enlarges on the Romanist attempt under James II.\r\nThe bright and dark sides of the eighteenth century are exhibited in\r\nPembroke and Lincoln. To Corpus, which had described the Renaissance,\r\nit belongs almost of right to depict the renewed love of letters which\r\ndistinguishes the present century. And as with successive phases of\r\nsocial and intellectual life, so with other matters of interest.\r\nOriel College gives a full account of the different books of record\r\nof a College, and of the long warfare of contested elections. Lincoln\r\nCollege sets forth the constitutional arrangements of a pre-Reformation\r\nCollege. Lincoln and Worcester show through what uncertainties\r\nprojected Colleges have to pass before they are legally settled. Christ\r\nChurch suggests the architectural and artistic wealth of Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to the writers of the separate chapters to say that\r\nthe limits of length imposed on them, and the selection of subjects\r\nfor special treatment, are not of their own choosing. Space for fuller\r\ntreatment in each case is of necessity wanting; but somewhat greater\r\nlatitude has been allowed to those less fortunate Colleges which have\r\nno history of their own, extant or in prospect. Colleges which have\r\nfound their historian, will not, it is hoped, grudge their sisters this\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nA.

C. CONYBEARE, M.A., SOMETIME FELLOW OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular mind concerning the origin of University College is well\r\nexampled in the form of prayer which after the reform of religion was\r\nused in chapel on the day of the yearly College Festival, and which\r\nbegins in these words--\r\n\r\n“Merciful God and loving Father, we give Thee humble and hearty thanks\r\nfor Thy great Bounty bestow’d upon us of this place by Alfred the\r\nGreat, the first Founder of this House; William of Durham, the Restorer\r\nof it; Walter Skirlow, Henry Percy, Sir Simon Benet, Charles Greenwood,\r\nespecial Benefactors, with others, exhibitors to the same.”[1]\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. William Smith, Rector of Melsonby, and above twelve years\r\nSenior Fellow of our Society, who in the year 1728 published his\r\nlearned Annals of the College, sets it down that King Alfred was not\r\nmentioned in the College prayers as chief founder until the reign of\r\nCharles I., and he relates how “that Dr. Clayton, after he was chosen\r\nMaster (in 1665), when he first heard King Alfred named in the collect\r\nbefore William of Durham, openly and aloud cried out in the chapel,\r\n‘_There is no King Alfred there_.’”\r\n\r\nFor at an earlier date it had been of custom to pray indeed for the\r\nsoul of King Alfred, but only in the following order--\r\n\r\n“I commend also unto your devout Prayers, the souls departed out\r\nof this world, especially The Soul of William of Durham, our chief\r\nFounder. The Soul of Mr. Walter Skirlaw, especial Benefactor. The Soul\r\nof King Alfred, Founder of the University. The Soul of King Henry the\r\n5th. The Souls of Henry Percy, first Earl of Northumberland; Henry the\r\n2nd Earl, and my Ladies their Wives, with all their Issue out of the\r\nWorld departed.… The Souls of all them that have been Fellows, and all\r\ngood Doers. And for the Souls of all them that God would have be prayed\r\nfor.”\r\n\r\nThe date of this form of prayer is concurrent with Philip and Mary;\r\nbetween whose reign and that of Charles I. it is therefore certain\r\nthat King Alfred was lifted in our prayers from being Founder only of\r\nthe University to the being Founder of our College. And in so much as\r\nduring many generations the belief that this college was founded by\r\nKing Alfred has, by all who are competent to judge, been condemned\r\nfor false and erroneous, I will follow the example of the learned\r\nantiquarian already mentioned, and recount its true foundation by\r\nWilliam of Durham; eschewing the scruples of those brave interpreters\r\nof the law, who in the year 1727 said in Westminster Hall, “that King\r\nAlfred must be confirmed our Founder, for the sake of Religion itself,\r\nwhich would receive a greater scandal by a determination on the other\r\nSide, than it had by all the Atheists, Deists, and Apostates, from\r\nJulian down to Collins; that a succession of Clergymen for so many\r\nyears should return thanks for an Idol, or mere Nothing, in Ridicule\r\nand Banter of God and Religion, must not be suffered in a court of\r\nJustice.”[2]\r\n\r\nThe historical origin of University College dates from the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and was in this wise. There was in the year 1229, so Matthew\r\nParis relates, a great falling out between the students and citizens of\r\nParis, and, as was usual for Academicians then to do, all the scholars\r\nremoved to other places, where they could have civiller usage, and\r\ngreater privileges allowed them, as the Oxonians had done in King\r\nJohn’s time, when three thousand removed to Reading and Maidstone (and\r\nas some say to Cambridge also). It appears that the English king,\r\nHenry III., was not blind to the advantages which would accrue to his\r\ncountry from an influx of scholars, and therefore published Letters\r\nPatent on the 14th July, of that very year, to invite the masters\r\nand scholars of the University to England; and foreseeing they would\r\nprefer Oxford before any other place, the said king sent several Writs\r\nto the Burgers of Oxon, to provide all conveniences, as lodgings,\r\nand all other good Entertainment, and good usage to welcome them\r\nthither.[3] Among other Englishmen who left Paris in consequence of\r\nthese dissensions, was Master William of Durham, who repaired at first\r\nto Anjou only. But we may well suppose that his attention was drawn\r\nby the fostering edicts of the English king to Oxford as a centre of\r\nschools. It is certain that when he died, at Rouen, on his way home\r\nfrom Rome, twenty years later, in 1249, “abounding in great Revenues,\r\neminently learned, and Rector of that noble Church of Weremouth, not\r\nfar from the sea,” he bequeathed to the University of Oxford the sum of\r\nthree hundred and ten marks, for purchase of annual rents, unto the use\r\nof ten or eleven or twelve, or more Masters, who should be maintained\r\nwithal.\r\n\r\nThe above information is derived from a report drawn up in 1280, by\r\ncertain persons delegated by the University of Oxford to enquire into\r\nthe Testament of Master William of Durham; which report is still kept\r\namong the muniments of the College, and constitutes our earliest\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century there was not the same choice of investments\r\nas to-day. The best one could do was to lend out one’s money to\r\nthe nobles and king of the Realm, or to purchase houses therewith.\r\nThe former security corresponded to, but was not so secure as, the\r\nconsolidated funds of a later age. Nor was house property entirely\r\nsafe. For in an age when communication between different parts of the\r\ncountry was slow and insecure, it was not of choice, but of necessity,\r\nthat one bought house property in one’s own city; since farther afield\r\nand in places wide apart one lacked trusty agents to collect one’s\r\nrents; but in a single city a plague might in one year lay empty half\r\nthe houses, and so forfeit to the owners their yearly monies.\r\n\r\nIn laying out William of Durham’s bequest, the University had recourse\r\nto both these kinds of security. As early as the year 1253, a house\r\nwas bought for thirty-six marks from the priors and brethren of the\r\nhospital of Brackle; perhaps for the reception of William of Durham’s\r\nearliest scholars. This house stood in the angle between School\r\nStreet and St. Mildred’s Lane (which to-day is Brazenose Lane), and\r\ncorresponded therefore with the north-east corner of the present\r\nBrazenose College. Two years later, in 1255, was purchased from the\r\npriors of Sherburn, a house in the High Street, standing opposite the\r\nlodge of the present college, where now is Mr. Thornton’s book-shop.\r\nFor this piece of property the University paid, out of William of\r\nDurham’s money, forty-eight marks down.\r\n\r\nThis house, the second purchase made out of the founder’s bequest,\r\nafter belonging to the College for upwards of six hundred years, was\r\nlately sold to Magdalen College instead of being exchanged as it should\r\nhave been, if it was to be alienated at all, with a house belonging to\r\nQueen’s College, numbered 85 on the opposite side of the street. And\r\nat the same time, all properties and tenements, not already belonging\r\nto us, except the aforesaid No. 85, intervening between Logic Lane and\r\nthe New Examination Schools, were purchased, to give our College the\r\nfaculty of some day, if need be, extending itself on that side.\r\n\r\nThe third house bought out of the same bequest adjoined (to the south)\r\nthe former of the two already mentioned, and fronting on School Street,\r\nwas called as early as A.D. 1279, Brazen-Nose Hall. It cost £55 6_s._\r\n8_d._ sterling, and on its site stands to-day Brazen-nose College gate\r\nand chapel. The purchase was completed in 1262. The last of the early\r\npurchases made by the University for the College consisted of two\r\nhouses east of Logic Lane on the south side of the High Street. (The\r\nold Saracen’s Head Inn on the same side of Logic Lane only came to the\r\nCollege in the last century by the bequest of Dr. John Browne, who\r\nbecame master in 1744.) These two houses paid a Quit Rent of fifteen\r\nshillings, for which the University gave, A.D. 1270, seven pounds\r\nof William of Durham’s money, proving, as Mr. Smith notes, that in\r\nthe thirteenth century houses were purchased in Oxford at ten years’\r\npurchase, so that you received eleven per cent. interest on your money.\r\n\r\nThe rents of all these houses, so we learn from the Inquisition of the\r\nyear 1280 already mentioned, amounted to eighteen marks. As to the\r\nrest of the money bequeathed, the Masters of Arts appointed by the\r\nUniversity in 1280 to enquire found, “That the University needing it\r\nfor itself, and other great men of the Land that had recourse to the\r\nUniversity; the rest of the money, to wit, one hundred Pounds and ten\r\nMarks, had been made use of, partly for its own necessary occasions,\r\nand partly lent to other persons, of which money nothing at all is yet\r\nrestored.”\r\n\r\nThe barons to whom the University thus lent money had long been at\r\nstrife with King Henry for his extortions, and in May of 1264 won the\r\nBattle of Lewes against him. With them the University took side against\r\nthe king, so far at least as to advance them money out of William of\r\nDurham’s chest. It is not certain--though it seems probable--that some\r\nfew scholars were as early as 1253 invited by the University to live\r\ntogether, as beneficiaries of William of Durham, in the Hall which was\r\nin that year purchased out of his bequest. If it be asked how were they\r\nsupported, it may be answered: with the interest paid by the nobles\r\nupon the hundred pounds lent to them; for, since the capital sum was\r\nafterwards repaid, it is fair to suppose that the interest was also\r\ngot in year by year from the first. Although the University drew up no\r\nstatutes for William of Durham’s scholars till the year 1280, yet his\r\nvery will--which is now lost--may have served as a prescription ruling\r\ntheir way of life, even as it was made the basis of those statutes of\r\n1280. Perhaps, however, his scholars were scattered over the different\r\nhalls until 1280, when, after the pattern of the nephews and scholars\r\nof Walter de Merton, they were gathered under a single roof for the\r\nadvancement of their learning and improvement of their discipline.\r\nEven if they lived apart, the title of college can hardly be denied\r\nto them, for--to quote Mr. William Smith--“taking it for granted and\r\nbeyond dispute, that William of Durham dyed A.D. 1249, and that several\r\npurchases were bought with his money shortly after his death, as the\r\ndeeds themselves testifie; all the doubt that can afterwards follow is,\r\nwhether William of Durham’s Donation to ten, eleven, or twelve masters\r\nor scholars, were sufficient to erect them into a society? and whether\r\nthat society could properly be called a college?” And the same writer\r\nadds that a college “signifies not a building made of brick or stone,\r\nadorned with gates, towers, and quadrangles; but a company, or society\r\nadmitted into a body, and enjoying the same or like privileges one with\r\nanother.” Such was a college in the old Roman sense.\r\n\r\nWe will then leave it to the reader to decide whether University\r\nCollege is or is not the earliest college in Europe, even though its\r\nfoundation by King Alfred is mythical, and will pass on to view the\r\nstatutes made in the year 1280. In that year at least the Masters\r\ndelegated by the University “to enquire and order those things which\r\nhad relation to the Testament of Master William of Durham,” ordained\r\nthat “The Chancellor with some Masters in Divinity, by their advice,\r\nshall call other masters of other Faculties; and these masters with\r\nthe Chancellor, bound by the Faith they owe to the University, shall\r\nchuse out of all who shall offer themselves to live of the said rents,\r\nfour Masters, whom in their consciences they shall think most fit\r\nto advance, or profit in the Holy Church, who otherwise have not to\r\nlive handsomely without it in the State of Masters of Arts.… The same\r\nmanner of Election shall be for the future, except only that those four\r\nthat shall be maintained out of that charity shall be called to the\r\nelection, of which four one at least shall be a Priest.\r\n\r\n“These four Masters shall each receive for his salary fifty shillings\r\nsterling[4] yearly, out of the Rents bought.…\r\n\r\n“The aforesaid four masters, living together, shall study Divinity;\r\nand with this also may hear the Decretum and Decretalls, if they shall\r\nthink fit; who, as to their manner of living and learning, shall\r\nbehave themselves as by some fit and expert persons, deputed by the\r\nChancellor, shall be ordered. But if it shall so happen, that any ought\r\nto be removed from the said allowance, or office, the Chancellor and\r\nMasters of Divinity shall have Power to do it.”\r\n\r\nBy the same Statutes a procurator or Bursar was appointed to take care\r\nof rents already bought and procure the buying of other rents. This\r\nBursar was to receive fifty-five shillings instead of fifty. He was to\r\nhave one key of William of Durham’s chest, the Chancellor another, and\r\na person appointed by the University Proctors the third.\r\n\r\nThree points are evident from these statutes: firstly, that in its\r\ninception the College of William of Durham was entirely the care of the\r\nUniversity, which thus held the position of Visitor. Secondly, theology\r\nwas to be the chief, if not sole study of the beneficiaries. Perhaps\r\nthe founder viewed with jealousy the study of Roman law, which was\r\nbeginning to engross some of the best minds of the age. Thirdly, only\r\nMasters were admissible as Fellows. It was the custom at the time to\r\nhave graduated in Arts before proceeding to teach Divinity.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of twelve years, A.D. 1292, at the Procurement of the\r\nExecutors of the Venerable Mr. William of Durham, who were, it seems,\r\nstill living, the University made new statutes for the College. In\r\nthese new statutes we hear for the first time of a Master of the\r\nCollege, of commoners, and of a College library. The Senior Fellow was\r\nto govern the Juniors, and get half a mark yearly for his diligence\r\ntherein. Thus the headship of the College went at first by succession,\r\nand not until 1332 by election; after which date the master was\r\nrequired to be cæteris paribus proxime Dunelmiam oriundus, or at least\r\nof northern extraction.\r\n\r\nThe first alien to the College who was elected Master was Ralph\r\nHamsterley, in 1509. Previously he was a fellow of Merton College,\r\nwhere in the chapel he was buried. (Brodrick, _Memorials of Merton\r\nCollege_, p. 240.) He was “nunquam de gremio nostro neque de comitiva,”\r\nand was therefore chosen Master conditionally upon the visitors\r\ngranting a dispensation to depart from the ordinary rule. (W. Smith’s\r\nMSS., xi. p. 2.)\r\n\r\nThe Master had until lately as much or as little right to marry as\r\nany of the Fellows, and in 1692 the Fellows, before electing Dr.\r\nCharlet, exacted from him a promise that he would not marry, or, if\r\nhe did, would resign within a year. It seems that in old days Fellows\r\nof Colleges who were obliged to be in Holy Orders were free to marry\r\nafter King James the I.’s parliament had sanctioned the marriage of\r\nclergymen. Already in 1422 the Master is called the custos, but he\r\nwas till 1736, when new statutes made a change, called “_the Master\r\nor Senior Fellow, Magister vel senior socius_.” He had the key of\r\nthe College, but in time delegated the function of letting people\r\nin and out to a statutory porter. The introduction of commoners or\r\nscholars not on the foundation is thus referred to in these statutes\r\nof 1292: “Since the aforesaid scholars have not sufficient to live\r\nhandsomely alone by themselves, but that it is expedient that other\r\nhonest persons dwell with them; it is ordained that every Fellow shall\r\nsecretly enquire concerning the manners of every one that desires to\r\nsojourn with them; and then, if they please, by common consent, let him\r\nbe received under this condition, That before them he shall promise\r\nwhilst he lives with them, that he will honestly observe the customs\r\nof the Fellows of the House, pay his Dues, not hurt any of the Things\r\nbelonging to the House, either by himself, or those that belong to him.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1381 we find from the Bursar’s roll that the students\r\nnot on the foundation paid £4 18_s._ as rents for their chambers, a\r\nconsiderable sum in those days.\r\n\r\nAs to the books of the College, it was ordained that there be put one\r\nbook of every sort that the House has, in some common and secure place;\r\nthat the Fellows, and others with the consent of a Fellow, may for the\r\nfuture have the benefit of it.\r\n\r\nFor the rest it was ordained that the Fellows should speak Latin often,\r\nand at every Act have one Disputation in Philosophy or Theology,\r\nand have one Disputation at least in the principal Question of both\r\nFaculties in the Vespers, and another in the Inception in their private\r\nCollege. In these disputations it is clear that rival disputants\r\nsometimes lost their tempers from the following ordinance--\r\n\r\n“No Fellow shall under-value another Fellow, but shall correct his\r\nFault privately, under the Penalty of Twelve-pence to be paid to the\r\ncommon-Purse; nor before one that is no Fellow, under the Penalty of\r\ntwo shillings; nor publickly in the Highway, or Church, or Fields,\r\nunder the penalty of half a mark; and in all these cases, he that\r\nbegins first shall double what the other is to pay, and this in\r\nDisputations especially.”\r\n\r\nIn those days a lesson was read during dinner. In these degenerate days\r\nall the above salutary rules are inverted, and it is customary for the\r\nsenior scholar to sconce in a pot of beer any junior member who quotes\r\nLatin during the Hall-dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1311 fresh statutes were ordained by convocation for the\r\nCollege, which, however, add little to the former ones. Of candidates\r\nfor a Fellowship, otherwise duly qualified, he was to be preferred who\r\ncomes from near Durham. After seven years a Fellow was to oppose in the\r\nDivinity Schools, which was equivalent to nowadays taking the degree\r\nof Doctor of Divinity. Each Fellow or past-Fellow was to put up a mass\r\nonce a year for the Repose of the soul of William of Durham; and all\r\nalike were to cause themselves to be called, so far as lay in their\r\npower, the scholars of William of Durham. Lastly, the Senior Fellow was\r\nto be in Holy Orders. This, however, must not be taken to mean that\r\nthe other Fellows were not to be so likewise. They were till recently\r\nexpected to be ordained within four years of their degree, and the\r\nStatutes of 1311 A.D. were reaffirmed in that sense by the visitors\r\nunder the chancellorship of Dr. Fell, 1666 A.D., when it was sought to\r\nremove Mr. Berty, a Bennet Fellow, because he had not taken orders.\r\n\r\nIn or about the year 1343 the scholars of William of Durham removed to\r\nthe present site of the College, where a house called Spicer’s Hall,\r\noccupying the ground now included in the large quadrangle, had been\r\nbought for them. At the same time White Hall and Rose Hall, two houses\r\nfacing Kybald Street--which joined the present Logic Lane and Grove\r\nStreet half-way down each--were bought, and made part of the College.\r\nLudlow Hall, on the site of the present east quadrangle, was bought at\r\nthe same time, and a tenement, called in 1379 Little University Hall,\r\nand occupying the site of the Lodgings of the Master (which in 1880,\r\non the completion of the Master’s new house, were turned into men’s\r\nrooms), was bought in 1404. But Ludlow Hall and Little University Hall\r\nwere not at once added to the College premises.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hundred years of the life of the College its members\r\nwere called simply _University Scholars_, and the ordinance of A.D.\r\n1311, that they should call themselves _the Scholars of William of\r\nDurham_, proves that that was not the name in common vogue. Their\r\nold house at the corner of what is to-day Brazen-nose College was\r\ncalled the _Aula Universitatis in Vico Scholarum_ (the Hall of the\r\nUniversity in School Street). After 1343, the probable year of their\r\nmigration, until at least 1361, the College was called as before _Aula\r\nUniversitatis_, only _in Alto Vico_, i. e. in High Street. After 1361\r\nthey assumed the official title of _Master and Fellows of the Hall of\r\nWilliam of Durham_, commonly called _Aula Universitatis_. It was not\r\ntill 1381 that the present title _Magna Aula Universitatis_, or Mickle\r\nUniversity Hall, was used, in distinction from the _Little University\r\nHall_, which was only separated from it by Ludlow Hall. But the\r\nnomenclature was not uniform, and in Elizabeth’s reign, as in Richard\r\nII.’s, it was called _the College of William of Durham_.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the foundation of the College by King Alfred has been\r\nmentioned, and here is a convenient place to conjecture how and when\r\nit arose. The first mention of it we meet with in a petition addressed\r\nin French to King Richard II., A.D. 1381, by his “poor Orators, the\r\nMaster and Scholars of your College, called Mickil University Hall in\r\nOxendford, which College was first founded by your noble Progenitor,\r\nKing Alfred (whom God assoyle), for the maintenance of twenty-four\r\nDivines for ever.” Twenty years before, in 1360, Laurence Radeford, a\r\nFellow, had bought for the College various messuages, shops, lands and\r\nmeadows yielding rents of the yearly value of £15. This purchase was\r\nmade out of the residuum of William of Durham’s money, now all called\r\nin. But it turned out that the title to the new property was bad, and,\r\nafter forging various deeds without success, the College appealed\r\nin the above petition to the king, Richard II., to exercise his\r\nprerogative, and take the case out of the common courts, in which--so\r\nruns the petition--the plaintiff, Edmond Frauncis, citizen of London,\r\n“has procured all the Pannel of the Inquest to be taken by Gifts and\r\nTreats.”\r\n\r\nThe petition prays the king to see that the College be not “tortiously\r\ndisinherited,” and appeals to the memory of the “noble Saints John\r\nof Beverley, Bede, and Richard of Armagh, formerly scholars of the\r\nCollege.” A petition so full of fictions hardly deserved to lead to\r\nsuccess, and the College was eventually compelled to redeem its right\r\nto the estate by payment of a large sum of money to the heirs of\r\nFrauncis. The interest of this petition, however, lies in the fact\r\nthat in 1728, on the occasion of a dispute arising for the mastership\r\nbetween Mr. Denison and Mr. Cockman, it formed the ground upon which,\r\nin the King’s Bench at Westminster, it was held that the College is a\r\nRoyal foundation, and the Crown the rightful visitor; the truth being\r\nthat the whole body of Regents and non-Regents of the University were\r\nand always had been the true and rightful visitor.\r\n\r\nBut the French Petition to Richard II. was not the only fabrication to\r\nwhich William of Durham’s unworthy beneficiaries had recourse in order\r\nto establish a fictitious antiquity and deny their real founder. About\r\nthe same time they stole the chancellor’s seal and affixed its impress\r\nto a forged deed purporting to have been executed in A.D. 1220, the 4th\r\nof Henry III., May 10th, by Lewis de Chapyrnay, Chancellor. This false\r\ndeed records the receipt of four hundred marks bequeathed by William,\r\nArchdeacon of Durham, for the maintenance of six Masters of Arts, and\r\nthe conveyance of certain tenements to Master Roger Caldwell, Warden\r\nand senior Fellow of the great hall of the University. The reader\r\nwill the more agree that this forgery was worthier of Shapira than of\r\n“honest and holy clerks,” when he reads in Antony à Wood (_City of\r\nOxford_, ed. Andrew Clark, vol. i. p. 561)--who was not deceived by\r\nit--that it was written “on membrane cours, thick, greasy, whereas,\r\nin the reign of Henry III. parchment was not so, but fine and clear.”\r\nThere never were such persons as Chapyrnay and Caldwell, and William\r\nof Durham did not die till 1249, and then left only three hundred and\r\nten marks. Mr. Twine, the author of the _Apology for the Antiquity of\r\nOxford_, said of this deed, “mentiri nescit, it cannot lie.” “But,”\r\nsays quaintly Mr. William Smith, “if ever there was a lie in the world,\r\nthat which we find in that Charter is as great a one as ever the Devil\r\ntold since he deceived our first Parents in Paradise.”\r\n\r\nIt would oppress the reader to detail all the other fictions which\r\nfollowed on this early one. One lie makes many, and as time went on\r\noutward embellishments were added to the College commemorative of its\r\nmythical founder. Thus a picture of King Alfred was bought in the\r\nyear 1662 for £3--perhaps the same which one now sees in the College\r\nlibrary. There was--so Mr. Smith relates--an older picture of him in\r\nthe Masters’ lodgings.\r\n\r\nA statue of Alfred also stood over the chapel door, and was removed by\r\nMr. Obadiah Walker, Master in 1676, to a niche over the hall door to\r\nmake place for a statue of St. Cuthbert, the patron saint of Durham, on\r\nwhose day the gaudy used to be celebrated until 1662, at which date it\r\nwas changed to the day of Saints Simon and Jude, out of respect to the\r\nmemory of Sir Simon Benet, who had lately bequeathed four Fellowships,\r\nfour scholarships, and various other benefits. This was the real cause\r\nof the 28th of October being chosen for the gaudy, although afterwards\r\nthe Aluredians absurdly pretended that it was the day of King Alfred’s\r\nobit. The statue of Alfred above-mentioned was given by Dr. Robert\r\nPlot, the well-known author of _The Natural History of Oxfordshire_,\r\nwho was a Fellow-commoner of the College, and it cost £3 1_s._ 5_d._ to\r\nremove it, as related, in the year 1686. A hundred years later a marble\r\nimage of Alfred was given to the College by Viscount Folkestone, which\r\nis now set up over the fireplace in the oak common-room. A relief of\r\nhim is also set over the fireplace in the college-hall, and was given\r\nby Sir Roger Newdigate, a member of the College, and founder of the\r\nUniversity annual prize for an English poem.\r\n\r\nA picture of St. John of Beverley, mentioned in the French petition\r\nto Richard II., was, we learn from Gutch’s edition of Antony Wood’s\r\n_Colleges and Halls_ (ed. 1786, p. 57), set in the east window of\r\nthe old chapel in the beginning of the seventeenth century. The same\r\nauthority assures us that until Dr. Clayton’s time (Master, 1605)\r\nthere were in a window on the west side of the little old quadrangle\r\npictures of King Alfred kneeling and St. Cuthbert sitting, … the king\r\nthus bespeaking the saint in a pentameter, holding the picture of the\r\nCollege in his hand, “Hic in honore tui collegium statui,” to whom the\r\nsaint made answer, in a scroll coming from his mouth--“Quæ statuisti in\r\neo pervertentes maledico.”\r\n\r\nIn a window of the outer chapel were also the arms of William of\r\nDurham, which were, “Or, a Fleur de lis azure, each leaf charged with\r\na mullet gules.” Round these arms was written on a scroll: “Magistri\r\nWillielmi de Dunelm … huius collegii”; the missing word, so Wood had\r\nbeen informed, was “Fundatoris,” erased, no doubt, by an Aluredian.\r\nThe arms of the College to-day are those of Edward the Confessor, to\r\nwit--“Azure, a cross patonce between five martlets Or.” We would do\r\nwell to resign our sham royalty, and return to the arms of William of\r\nDurham, our true founder.\r\n\r\nThe crowning fiction was the celebration in the year 1872 of the\r\nmillennium of the College, during the mastership of the Rev. G.\r\nG. Bradley, afterwards Dean of Westminster. It is said that a\r\ndistinguished modern historian ironically sent him a number of burned\r\ncakes, purporting to have been dug up at Athelney, to entertain King\r\nAlfred’s scholars withal. It is not recorded if they were served up or\r\nno to the guests, among whom were Dean Stanley and Mr. Robert Lowe,\r\nboth past tutors of the College. At the dinner which graced this festal\r\noccasion, the late Dean of Westminster is said to have ridiculed the\r\nidea of King Alfred having bestowed lands and tenements on scholars in\r\nOxford, which place was in A.D. 872 in possession of Alfred’s enemies\r\nthe Danes; whereupon Mr. Lowe made the happy answer, that this latter\r\nfact was itself a confirmation of the legend, for King Alfred was a man\r\nmuch before his time, who in the spirit of some modern leaders of the\r\ndemocracy took care to bestow on his followers, not his own lands, but\r\nthose of his political opponents.\r\n\r\nThis legend of King Alfred sprang up in the fourteenth century, when\r\npeople had forgotten the Norman Conquest and time had long healed all\r\nthe scars of an alien invasion. Then historians began to feel back to a\r\nmore remote period for the origin of institutions really subsequent.\r\nIn so doing they fed patriotic pride by establishing an unbroken\r\ncontinuity of the nation’s life. So to-day we see asserting itself, and\r\nwith better historical warranty, a belief in the antiquity of English\r\necclesiastical institutions. The best minds are no longer content\r\nwith that idol of the Evangelicals, a parliamentary church dating\r\nback no more than three centuries. It may be even that a good deal of\r\nthe Aluredian legend was earlier in its origin than the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and shaped itself at the first out of anti-Norman feeling.\r\nIn the reign of King Richard, anyhow, all sections of the now united\r\nnation accepted it, and not only have we the writ of King Richard\r\nII., dated May 4th, 1381 (in answer to the French petition), setting\r\ndown the College to be “the Foundation of the Progenitors of our Lord\r\nthe King, and of his Patronage,”[5] but in that very reign, if not\r\nlater, a passage was interpolated in MSS. of Asser’s _Life of Alfred_,\r\nidentifying the schools--which Alfred undoubtedly maintained--with the\r\nschools of Oxford. The Fellows of University only took advantage of a\r\nfeeling which was abroad, and by which they were also duped, when they\r\ndeclared themselves in the French petition to be a royal foundation.\r\nAntony Wood was not deceived by the legend, though he credits it in\r\nregard to the University. It is strange to find Hearne the antiquary,\r\nand Dr. Charlet, Master, 1692-1722, both acquaintances of Mr. W. Smith,\r\nadhering to the belief. Mr. Smith declares that Dr. Charlet did so from\r\nvanity, because he thought that to be head of a royal foundation added\r\nto his dignity. Obadiah Walker had sided with the Aluredians, because\r\nhe was a papist, and because Alfred had been a good Catholic king and\r\nfaithful to the Pope. What is most strange of all is that, although\r\nthe king’s attorney and solicitor-general, being duly commissioned to\r\ninquire, had, in October 1724 pronounced that the College was not a\r\nroyal foundation, nor the sovereign its legitimate visitor, yet the\r\nCourt of King’s Bench three years after decided both points in just\r\nthe opposite sense. It is an ill wind that blows no one any good. We\r\nthen lost the University as our visitor, but have since obtained gratis\r\non all disputed points the opinion of the highest law officer of the\r\nrealm, the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1307 and 1360 as many as sixteen halls in the\r\nparishes of St. Mary, St. Peter, St. Mildred, and All Hallows were\r\nbought for the College. They were no doubt let out as lodgings to\r\nUniversity students, and were in those days, as now, a remunerative\r\nform of investment; some of them standing on sites which have since\r\ncome to be occupied by colleges.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the fifteenth century that the College acquired\r\nproperty outside Oxford, and then not by purchase, but by bequest. In\r\nthose days locomotion was too difficult for a small group of scholars\r\nto venture on far-off purchases. But in 1403 Walter Skirlaw, Bishop\r\nof Durham, left to our College the Manor of Mark’s Hall, or Margaret\r\nRuthing, in Essex. The proceeds were to sustain three Fellows “chosen\r\nout of students at Oxford or Cambridge, and if possible born in\r\nthe dioceses of York and Durham.” It has already been remarked how\r\nclosely connected was the College with the North of England. No other\r\nconditions were attached to the benefaction save this, that “all the\r\nFellows shall every year, for ever, celebrate solemn obsequies in their\r\nchapel upon the day of the Bishop’s death, with a Placebo and Dirige,\r\nand a Mass for the dead the day after.” Is it altogether for good that\r\nwe have outgrown those customs of pious gratitude to the past? Bishop\r\nSkirlaw’s Fellowships, it may be added, figure in the Calendar as of\r\nthe foundation of Henry IV., because the lands were passed as a matter\r\nof legal form through the sovereign’s lands in order to avoid certain\r\ndifficulties connected with mortmains.\r\n\r\nThe next great benefactor of the College after Bishop Skirlaw was\r\nHenry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who in 1442 left property and the\r\nadvowson of Arncliffe in Craven in Yorkshire. Three Fellows drawn from\r\nthe dioceses of Durham, Carlisle, and York were to be sustained out of\r\nhis benefaction. The next chief benefaction was that of John Freyston\r\nor Frieston, who in 1592 bequeathed property in Pontefract for the\r\nsupport of a Fellow or Exhibitioner, who should be a Yorkshire man,\r\nand also by his will made the College trustee to pay certain yearly\r\nsums to the grammar schools of Wakefield, Normanton, Pontefract, and\r\nSwillington.\r\n\r\nComing to the seventeenth century, we find a Mr. Charles Greenwood, a\r\npast-Fellow, leaving a handsome bequest to the College, out of which,\r\nhowever, only £1500 was secured from his executors, which money paid\r\nfor the present fabric to be partially raised; the north side of the\r\nquadrangle, the chapel, and hall and old library being first begun A.D.\r\n1634. The present library was partly built out of money given by the\r\nexecutors and trustees of the second Lord Eldon, past-Fellow of the\r\nCollege. It shelters the colossal twin-image of his kinsmen, and was\r\ndesigned by Sir G. G. Scott, and is better suited to be a chapel than a\r\nlibrary. Then in 1631, Sir Simon Bennet, a relative and college pupil\r\nof Mr. Greenwood’s, left lands in Northampton to maintain eight Fellows\r\nand eight scholars; though they turned out sufficient to maintain but\r\nfour of each sort. The last great benefactor of this century was the\r\nfamous Dr. Radcliffe, formerly senior scholar, of whom the eastern\r\nquadrangle, built by his munificence, remains as a monument. Beside\r\ncompleting the fabrics he founded two medical Fellowships, and, dying\r\nin 1734, bequeathed in trust to the College for its uses his estate of\r\nLinton in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the limits of a short article to narrate all the\r\nvicissitudes which during the epochs of the Reformation and\r\nCommonwealth the College underwent. In the reign of Elizabeth it sided\r\nwith the Roman Catholics, and the Master and several Fellows were\r\nejected on that account. Later on, in 1642, the College _lent_ its\r\nplate, consisting of a silver flagon, 8 potts, 9 tankards, 18 bowles,\r\none candle-pott, and a salt-sellar to King Charles I., one flagon alone\r\nbeing kept for the use of the Communion. The gross weight as weighed at\r\nthe mint was 738 oz. The Fellows and commoners also contributed on 30th\r\nJuly, 1636, the sum of 19li. 10s. for entertaining the king; and again\r\non 17th Feb., 1636, 4li. 17s. 6d. Subsequently the College sustained\r\nfor many months 28 soldiers at the rate of 22li. 8s. per month. After\r\nall this show of loyalty we expect to learn that Cromwell ejected the\r\nMaster, Thomas Walker, and instituted a Roundhead, Joshua Hoyle, in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the College of the same name, but who achieved\r\nmore fame, was Obadiah Walker, who was already a Fellow under Thomas\r\nWalker’s mastership, and was ejected by the Long Parliament along with\r\nhim, and also with his old tutor, Mr. Abraham Woodhead. Woodhead and O.\r\nWalker retired abroad and visited Rome and many other places. At the\r\nRestoration they both regained their Fellowships, but Woodhead never\r\nmore conformed to the English Church. O. Walker, however, continued\r\nto take the Sacrament in the College chapel, and after that he was\r\nelected Master distributed it to the other Fellows, till, on the\r\naccession of James II., he “openly declared himself a Romanist, and\r\ngot a dispensation from his Majesty for himself and two Fellows, his\r\nconverts, who held their places till the king’s flight, notwithstanding\r\nthe laws to the contrary.” William Smith, who was a resident Fellow at\r\nthe time, has “many good things to say of Obadiah Walker, as that he\r\nwas neither proud nor covetous, and framed his usual discourse against\r\nthe Puritans on one side, and the Jesuits on the other, as the chief\r\ndisturbers of the peace, and hinderers of all concessions and agreement\r\namongst all true members of the Catholic Church.” He complains,\r\nhowever, that “as soon as he declared himself a Roman Catholic, he\r\nprovided him and his party of Jesuits for their Priests; concerning\r\nthe first of which (I think he went by the name of Mr. Edwards) there\r\nis this remarkable story, that having had mass said for some time in a\r\ngarret, he afterwards procured a mandate from K. James to seize on the\r\nlower half of a side of the quadrangle, next adjoining to the College\r\nchapel, by which he deprived us of two low rooms, their studies and\r\ntheir bed-chambers; and after all the partitions were removed, it was\r\nsomeway or other consecrated, as we suppose, to Divine services; for\r\nthey had mass there every day, and sermons at least in the afternoons\r\non the Lord’s Day.”\r\n\r\nSmith goes on to relate how the Jesuit chaplain was one day preaching\r\nfrom the text, “So run that you may obtain,” when one of many\r\nProtestants, who were harkening at the outside of the windows in the\r\nquadrangle, discovering that the Jesuit was preaching a sermon of Mr.\r\nHenry Smith, which he had at home by him, went and fetched the book,\r\nand read at the outside of the window what the Jesuit was preaching\r\nwithin. For this it seems the particular Jesuit got into trouble.\r\nSmith complains also that by mandate of the king, Walker sequestred\r\na Fellowship towards the maintenance of his priest, and incurred the\r\nCollege much expense in putting up the statue of James II., presented\r\nby a Romanist,[6] over the inside of a gate-house. He adds that “Mr.\r\nWalker that had the king’s ear, and entertained him at vespers in their\r\nchapel, and shewed the king the painted windows in our own, so that\r\nthe king could not but see his own statue in coming out of it, never\r\nhad the Prudence nor kindness to the College, as to request the least\r\nfavour to the society from him.”\r\n\r\nThat Mr. William Smith, who writes the above, could also make himself a\r\n_persona grata_ to the great men of State who came to Oxford to attend\r\non the king, we see from the following letter written by Lord Conyers,\r\nwho in 1681 lodged with his son in University College, on the occasion\r\nof the Parliament meeting in Oxford. It is dated Easter Thursday,\r\nLondon, 1681, and is as follows (MSS. Smith):--\r\n\r\n        “Sir,\r\n\r\n    I cannot satisfy my wife without giving you this trouble of\r\n    my thanks for your very greate kindnesse to me and my sonn:\r\n    we gott hither in v. good time on Thursday to waite on y^{e}\r\n    king before night; who was in a course of physick, but God be\r\n    praised is v. well & walked yesterday round Hide Parke. My son\r\n    also desires his humble services to you: And we both of us\r\n    desire our services & thanks to Mr. Ledgard & Mr. Smith for\r\n    y^{r} great civilities to us; & whenever I can serve any of\r\n    you or the College, be most confident to find me\r\n\r\n                     “Y^{r} most affect. friend &\r\n\r\n                                     “humble Servant\r\n\r\n                                              “Conyers.”\r\n\r\nIn 1680, March 30, London, Lord Conyers writes to O. Walker about\r\nsending his son to the College, “who is growne too bigge for schoole\r\ntho’ little I fear in scholarship … he is very towardly & capable to\r\nbe made a scholar.” He desires [letter of London, April 9, 1682] Mr.\r\nWalker to provide a tutor for “his young man.”\r\n\r\nSmith’s account of Obadiah Walker’s doings at the College is fitly\r\ncompleted by the following passage from a letter sent by a Romanist\r\npriest at Oxford, Father Henry Pelham, to the Provincial of the\r\nJesuits, Father John Clare (Sir John Warner, Bart.), preserved in the\r\nPublic Record Office in Brussels, and given in Bloxam’s _Magdalen\r\nCollege and James II._ (p. 227)--\r\n\r\n“Oxford, 1690, May 2.--Hon. Sir, You are desirous to know how things\r\nare with us in these troublous times, since trade (_religion_) is so\r\nmuch decayed. I can only say that in the general decline of trade we\r\nhave had our share. For before this turn we were in a very hopeful\r\nway, for we had three public shops (_chapels_) open in Oxford. One\r\ndid wholly belong to us, and good custom we had, viz. the University\r\n(_University College Chapel_); but now it is shut up. The Master was\r\ntaken, and has been ever since in prison, and the rest forced to\r\nabscond.”\r\n\r\nThus ended the last attempt to force the Romanist religion upon Oxford.\r\nIn the following December we find “Obadiah Walker” in the list of\r\nprisoners remaining at Faversham under a strong guard until the 30th of\r\nDecember, and then conducted some to the Tower, some to Newgate, and\r\nothers released. Mr. Obadiah Walker lived for many years afterwards,\r\nand added to the literary work he had already accomplished in Oxford a\r\nhistory of the Ejected Clergy. His memory long survived in Oxford, and\r\nwith the mob was kept alive in a doggrel ballad which bore the refrain,\r\n“Old Obadiah sings Ave Maria.”\r\n\r\nIn University College, under Obadiah Walker, were focussed all\r\nthe propagandist influences of the time. Dr. John Massey, Dean of\r\nChristchurch, 1686, referred to in Pelham’s letter, was originally a\r\nmember of University College, and was converted by Obadiah Walker.\r\nThere was also a printing press kept going in University to publish\r\nbooks of a Romanist tendency, which the University would not authorize\r\nto be printed by its Press.\r\n\r\nThe official College record (in the Register of Election) of the\r\ndeposition of Mr. Obadiah Walker from the headship of the College is as\r\nfollows (MSS. of Will. Smith, vol. vii. p. 113)--\r\n\r\n“About the middle of Dec., A.D. 1688, Mr. Obadiah Walker attempted to\r\nflee abroad, but was taken at Sittingbourne in Kent, and carried to\r\nLondon, and there lodged in the Tower on a charge of high treason.\r\n\r\n“On Jan. 7, 1689, the Fellows of University deputed Master Babman to\r\ngo to him and ask him if he would resign his post, to whom, after\r\ndeliberation lasting many days, Walker answered that he would not.\r\n\r\n“On Jan. 22, after this answer had been brought to Oxford and conveyed\r\nto the Vice-Chancellor, the latter summoned the Fellows to appear\r\nbefore the Visitors on Jan. 26, in the Apodyterium of the Venerable\r\nHouse of Convocation.\r\n\r\n“Where on Jan. 26, between 9 and 10 a.m., there appeared in person\r\nand as representing the College the following Fellows--Mr. Will.\r\nSmith, Tho. Babman, Tho. Bennet, Francis Forster, and besought the\r\nVice-Chancellor, Proctors, and Doctors of Divinity representing\r\nConvocation to remedy certain grievances in the College, specially\r\nconcerning the Master and two Fellows. To them a citation was then\r\nissued by the Vice-Chancellor, Proctors, Doctors of Divinity, and\r\nothers, as the ordinary and legitimate patrons and visitors of the\r\nCollege, to appear before them in the College Chapel on Monday, Feb. 4\r\nfollowing between 8-9 a.m.\r\n\r\n“On the appointed day there met in the chapel between 8-9 a.m. the\r\nVice-Chancellor, Gilbert Ironsyde, S.T.P., Rob. Say, Byron Eaton,\r\nMaster of Oriel, W. Lovett, Tho. Hyde, Chief Librarian, Tho. Turner,\r\nPresident of C.C.C., Jonath. Edwards, S.T.P., Thom. Dunstan, Pres. of\r\nMagdalen College, Will. Christmas, Jun. Proctor, and others. After the\r\nLitany had been repeated, the Vice-Chancellor prorogued the meeting\r\nto the common-room, where were present the afore-mentioned Fellows,\r\nand in addition Edw. Farrar, Jo. Gilve, Jo. Nailor, Jo. Hudson. The\r\nFellows preferred a complaint that the statutes of the Realm, of the\r\nUniversity, and of the College had been violated by Obadiah Walker,\r\nMaster or Senior Fellow of the College. They objected in particular\r\nthat he had left the religion of the Anglican Church, established\r\nand confirmed by the statutes of this Realm, and betaken himself to\r\nthe Roman or papistical religion; that he had held, fostered, and\r\nfrequented illegal conventicles within the aforesaid College; that he\r\nhad procured to be sequestred unto wrong uses and against the statutes\r\nthe income and emoluments of the Society; also that he had had printed\r\nbooks against the Reformed religion, and that within the College, and\r\nhad published the same unto the grave scandal as well of the University\r\nas of the College. All these charges were amply proved by trustworthy\r\nwitnesses, whereupon the visitors decreed that the post of Mr. Obadiah\r\nWalker was void and vacant. At the same time, at the instance of the\r\nsaid Fellows, Masters Boyse and Deane, Fellows of the College, who had\r\nleft the religion of the reformed Anglican Church, were ordered to be\r\nproceeded against so soon as a new Master or Senior Fellow was chosen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Obadiah Walker lived for many years after the accession of William\r\nand Mary. He was a man of great piety and vast and varied learning, as\r\nis shown by his books upon Religion, Logic, History, and Geography. He\r\nwrote a book upon Greenland, and made experiments in physics. A near\r\nfriend of the great benefactor of the College, Dr. John Radcliffe,\r\nhe sought to convert that famous physician to the Roman faith, but\r\nfound him as little inclined to believe in transubstantiation as “that\r\nthe phial in his hand was a wheelbarrow.” In spite of their want of\r\nreligious sympathy, however, the two men liked each other’s society,\r\nand the great physician, who respected Walker’s learning, gave him a\r\ncompetency during the latter years of his life. In the College archives\r\nis an elegant letter addressed by O. Walker, then Master, to Radcliffe,\r\nthanking him for his gift of the east window of the College chapel. It\r\nruns thus:\r\n\r\n    “Sir, we return you our humble and hearty thanks for your\r\n    noble and illustrious benefaction to this ancient foundation;\r\n    your generosity hath supplyed a defect and covered a blemish\r\n    in our chapell; the other lesse eminent windows seemed to\r\n    upbraid the chiefest as being more adorned and regardable than\r\n    that which ought to be most splendid; till you was pleased to\r\n    compassionate us and ennoble the best with the best work. Other\r\n    benefactions are to be sought out in registers and memorialls,\r\n    yours is conveyed with the light. The rising sun displays\r\n    the gallantry of your spirit, and withall puts us in mind as\r\n    often as we enter to our devotions to remember you and your\r\n    good actions towards us. Nor can we salute the morning light\r\n    without meditating on y^{e} Shepherds and y^{e} Angells adoring\r\n    the true Sun. And y^{r} holy praise and prostration by your\r\n    singular favour is continually proposed, as to our sight and\r\n    consideration, so to our example also. And so we do accept and\r\n    acknowledge it, not only as an object moving our devotions,\r\n    but as praise of y^{e} artificer who hath not only observed much\r\n    better decorum and proportion in his figures, but hath all so\r\n    ingeniously contrived that the light shall not be hindred as by\r\n    y^{e} daubery of y^{e} others.”--The letter concludes with a prayer\r\n    that Dr. Radcliffe may prosper in his profession.\r\n\r\nThe following quaint “letter sent by the College to begge contributions\r\ntowards the building the East Side of the quadrangle about y^{e} end of\r\n1674 or beginning of 1675 to the gentlemen in the North Parts” may\r\nfitly conclude our notice of this college (_vide_ MSS. W. Smith, x.\r\n239).\r\n\r\n        “Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n    “Your aged mother, and not yours alone, but of this whole\r\n    University, if not all other such nurseries of Learning, at\r\n    least in this nation, craves your assistance in the Time of\r\n    her Necessity. It is not long since her walls Ruining and her\r\n    Buildings, almost, after so many years, decayed; It pleased\r\n    God to excite two of her sonnes in especiall manner, M^{r}\r\n    Charles Greenwood, the tutor, and S^{r} Simon Benett, his pupill,\r\n    to compassionate her decay, Repair her Ruins and Renew with\r\n    Great Augmentation her former glory. But the late civil warrs\r\n    and other alterations intervening not only interrupted that\r\n    progresse which in a small time would have finished the work;\r\n    But also disappointed her of the Assistance of Diverse, who\r\n    were willing to contribute to her repairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “And we have very good Hopes that you will not be wanting to us\r\n    in this our Necessity; this being a college designed for and\r\n    most of the preferment in it limitted to Northern Scholars.\r\n    A college which hath had the felicity to be herselfe at this\r\n    present time DCCC. years old.… In recompense she may justly\r\n    expect that as she hath fostered your youths, so you would\r\n    cherish her age.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes._\r\n\r\np. 9. On Clerical Fellows.--It should be added that the statutes\r\nof 1736 provided that the two senior Fellows of the foundation of\r\nSir Simon Bennet might study Medicine or Law. In 1854 the general\r\nordinances of the Commissioners provided that there should be six\r\n(_i. e._ half of the) Fellows in Holy Orders. More recently clerical\r\nFellowships have been practically abolished in the College.\r\n\r\np. 14. Anti-Norman feeling.--A spirit of Rivalry with Cambridge may\r\nwith more reason be alleged in explanation of the acceptance of the\r\nAluredian Legend.\r\n\r\np. 14. On the Legend of King Alfred.--The Court of King’s Bench only\r\ndecided that the College is a Royal Foundation, not that it was\r\nactually founded by King Alfred. Cp. the Preamble of Statutes of 1736:\r\n“it manifestly appears by a Judgement lately given in our Court of\r\nKings Bench that the college of the great Hall of the University,\r\ncommonly called University College, in Oxford, is of the foundation of\r\nour Royal Progenitors.”\r\n\r\np. 23. On Northern Scholars.--The College lost its one-sided Northern\r\ncharacter in 1736, when new statutes ordained that Sir Simon Bennet’s\r\nFellows were to come from the Southern Province of Canterbury (in\r\npartibus regni nostri Australibus oriundi).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBALLIOL COLLEGE.[7]\r\n\r\nBY REGINALD L. POOLE, M.A., BALLIOL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe precedence of Balliol over Merton College depends upon the fact\r\nthat John Balliol made certain payments not long after 1260 for the\r\nsupport of poor students at Oxford, while Walter of Merton’s foundation\r\ndates from 1264; but it was not until the example had been set by\r\nMerton that the House of Balliol assumed a corporate being and became\r\ngoverned by formal statutes. The “pious founder” too was at the outset\r\nan involuntary agent, for the obligation to make his endowment was\r\npart of a penance imposed on him together with a public scourging\r\nat the Abbey door by the Bishop of Durham.[8] John Balliol, lord of\r\nGalloway, was the father of that John to whom King Edward the First of\r\nEngland adjudged the Scottish crown in 1292. His wife, the heiress,\r\nwas Dervorguilla, grandniece to King William the Lion. It is to her\r\nfar more than to her husband that the real foundation of the College\r\nbearing his name is due, and husband and wife are rightly coupled\r\ntogether as joint-founders, the lion of Scotland being associated with\r\nthe orle of Balliol on the College shield. A house was first hired\r\nbeyond the city ditch on the north side of Oxford, hard by the church\r\nof St. Mary Magdalen, and here certain poor scholars were lodged and\r\npaid eightpence a-day for their commons.[9] It was in the beginning a\r\nsimple almshouse, founded on the model already existing at Paris, it\r\ndepended for its maintenance upon the good pleasure of the founder, and\r\npossessed (so far as we know) no sort of organization, though customs\r\nand rules were certain to shape themselves before long without any\r\npositive enactment.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted until 1282, when Dervorguilla,--her\r\nhusband had died in 1269,--took steps to place the House of Balliol\r\nupon an established footing. By her charter deed[10] she appointed two\r\nrepresentatives or “proctors” (one, it seems probable, being always\r\na Franciscan friar, and the other a secular Master of Arts) as the\r\ngoverning body of the House. The Scholars were, it is true, to elect\r\ntheir own Principal, and obey him “according to the statutes and\r\ncustoms approved among them,” but he and they were alike subordinate\r\nto the Proctors or (as they came to be distinguished) the Extraneous\r\nMasters. The Scholars, whose number is not mentioned, were to attend\r\nthe prescribed religious services and the exercises at the schools, and\r\nwere also to engage in disputations among themselves once a fortnight.\r\nThree masses in the year were to be celebrated for the founders’\r\nwelfare, and mention of them was to be made in the blessing before\r\nand grace after meat. Rules were laid down for the distribution of\r\nthe common funds; if they fell short it was ordered that the poorer\r\nScholars were not to suffer. The use of the Latin language (apparently\r\nat the common table) was strictly enjoined upon the Scholars. Whoever\r\nbroke the rule was to be admonished by the Principal, and if he\r\noffended twice or thrice was to be removed from the common table, to\r\neat by himself, and be served last of all. If he remained incorrigible\r\nafter a week, the Proctors were to expel him. One feature of the\r\nBalliol Statutes which deserves particular notice is that none of them,\r\nuntil we reach the endowments of the sixteenth century, placed any sort\r\nof local restriction upon those who were capable of being elected to\r\nthe Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis charter was plainly but the giving of a constitution to a society\r\nwhich had already formed for itself rules and usages with respect to\r\ndiscipline and other matters not referred to in it. The “House of\r\nthe Scholars of Balliol” was placed on a still more assured footing\r\nwhen its charter was confirmed by Bishop Sutton of Lincoln two years\r\nlater,[11] in which year the Scholars removed to a house bought for\r\nthem by the foundress in Horsemonger-street, a little to the eastward\r\nof their previous abode;[12] and soon afterwards the Bishop permitted\r\nthem to hold divine service, though they still attended their parish\r\nChurch of St. Mary Magdalen on all great festivals.[13] Before the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century the society had considerably enlarged\r\nits position. It had bought houses on both sides of its existing\r\nbuilding, so that it now occupied very nearly the site of the present\r\nfront-quadrangle.[14] It received from private benefactors endowment\r\nfor two Chaplains; and in 1327, with help furnished through the\r\nAbbot of Reading,[15] the building of a Chapel dedicated to Saint\r\nCatherine--the special patron whom we find first associated with the\r\nCollege in the letter of Bishop Sutton--was carried into effect.\r\nBut the College remained dependent upon its parish Church for the\r\ncelebration of the Mass until the Chapel was expressly licensed for\r\nthe purpose by Pope Urban the Fifth in April 1364. As early as 1310\r\nthe College had become possessed of a messuage containing four schools\r\non the west side of School-street, which were, according to the usual\r\npractice, let out to those who had exercises to perform, and thus added\r\nto the resources of the College.[16] Some unused land on this property\r\nwas afterwards conveyed to the University to form part of the site\r\nof the Divinity School, and the University still pays the College a\r\nquitrent for it.[17]\r\n\r\nDuring this time there seems to have been an active dispute among the\r\nScholars as to the studies which they were permitted to pursue. Bishop\r\nSutton had expressly ordained that they should dwell in the House\r\n_until they had completed their course in Arts_. It seemed naturally\r\nto follow that it was not lawful for them to go on to a further course\r\nof study, for instance, in Divinity, without ceasing their connection\r\nwith the House. At length in 1325 this inference was formally ratified\r\nby the two Extraneous Masters in the presence of all the members as\r\nwell as four graduates who had formerly been _Fellows_ (a title which\r\nnow first appears in our muniments as a synonym for Scholars) of the\r\nHouse.[18] One of the Extraneous Masters was Nicolas Tingewick, who\r\nis otherwise known to us as a benefactor of the Schools of Grammar in\r\nthe University;[19] and one of the ex-Fellows was Richard FitzRalph,\r\nafterwards Vice-Chancellor of the University and Archbishop of Armagh,\r\nthe man to whom above all others John Wycliffe, a later member of\r\nBalliol, owed the distinguishing elements of his teaching.[20] It was\r\nthus decided that Balliol should be a home exclusively of secular\r\nlearning; and it reads as a curious presage, that thus early in the\r\nhistory of the College the field should be marked out for it in which,\r\nin the fifteenth century and again in our own day, it was peculiarly\r\nto excel.\r\n\r\nBut the theologians soon had some compensation, for in 1340 a new\r\nendowment was given to the College by Sir Philip Somerville for their\r\nspecial benefit. From the Statutes which accompanied his gift[21]\r\nwe learn that the existing number of Fellows was sixteen; this he\r\nincreased to twenty-two (or more, if the funds would allow), with the\r\nprovision that six of the Fellows should, after they had attained their\r\nregency in Arts, enter upon a course of theology, together with canon\r\nlaw if they pleased, extending in ordinary cases over _not more_ than\r\ntwelve or thirteen years from their Master’s degree in Arts. Such was\r\nthe rigour of the demands made upon the theological student in the\r\nUniversity system of the middle ages; with what results as to solidity\r\nand erudition it is not necessary here to say.\r\n\r\nSomerville’s Statutes further made several important changes in the\r\nconstitution of the Hall or House, as it is here called. The Principal\r\nstill exists, holding precedence among the Fellows, much like that\r\nof the President in some of the Colleges at Cambridge; but he is\r\nsubordinate to the Master, who is elected by the society subject to\r\nthe approval of a whole series of Visitors. After election the Master\r\nwas first to present himself and take oath before the lord of Sir\r\nPhilip Somerville’s manor of Wichnor, and then to be presented by two\r\nof the Fellows and the two Extraneous Masters to the Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, or his Deputy, and to the Prior of the Monks of Durham\r\nat Oxford. By these his appointment was confirmed. There was thus\r\nestablished a complicated system of a threefold Visitatorial Board. The\r\npowers of the lords of Wichnor were indeed probably formal; but those\r\nof the Extraneous Masters subsisted side by side by, and to some extent\r\nindependently of, the Chancellor and the Prior. The former retained\r\ntheir previous authority over the Fellows of the old foundation; they\r\nwere only associated with the Chancellor and Prior with respect to the\r\nnew theological Fellows. Finally, over all the Bishop of Durham was\r\nplaced, as a sort of supreme Visitor, to compel the enforcement of\r\nthe provisions affecting Somerville’s bequest. One wonders how this\r\nelaborate scheme worked, and particularly how the society of Balliol\r\nliked the supervision of the Prior of Durham College just beyond their\r\ngarden-wall. But the curious thing is that the benefactor declares that\r\nin making these Statutes he intends not to destroy but to confirm the\r\nancient rules and Statutes of the College, as though some part of his\r\nextraordinary arrangements had been already in force.[22]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to guess that the scheme was impracticable, and in fact so\r\nearly as 1364 a new code had to be drawn up. This was given, under\r\npapal authority, by Simon Sudbury, Bishop of London, afterwards\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury; but unfortunately it is not preserved. We\r\ncan only gather from later references that it changed more than it\r\nleft of the existing Statutes, and that it established Rectors (almost\r\ncertainly the old Proctors or Extraneous Masters under a new name[23])\r\nto control the Master and Fellows, and possibly a Visitor over all.\r\nBut the one thing positive is that a right of ultimate appeal was now\r\nreserved to the Bishop of London, who thus came to exercise something\r\nmore than the power which was in later times committed to the Visitor.\r\nIt was by his authority that in the course of the fifteenth century\r\nthe property-limitation affecting the Master was abolished, and he was\r\nempowered to hold a benefice of whatever value;[24] and that Chaplains\r\nwere made eligible, equally with the Fellows, for the office of\r\nMaster.[25] On the one hand the dignity of the Master was increased; on\r\nthe other the ecclesiastical element was brought to the front.\r\n\r\nThe latter point becomes more than ever clear in the Statutes which\r\nwere framed for the College in 1507, and which remained substantially\r\nin force until the Universities Commission of 1850. The cause of their\r\npromulgation is obscurely referred to the violent and high-handed\r\naction of a previous--possibly the existing--Visitor. The matter was\r\nlaid before Pope Julius the Second, and he deputed the Bishops of\r\nWinchester and Carlisle, or one of them, to draw up an amended body of\r\nStatutes which should preclude the repetition of such misgovernment.\r\nThe Statutes[26] themselves are the work of the Bishop of Winchester,\r\nthe same Richard Fox who left so enduring a monument of his piety and\r\nzeal for learning in his foundation of Corpus Christi College. That\r\nfoundation however was ten years later, and Fox had not yet, it should\r\nseem, formed in his mind the pattern according to which a College in\r\nthe days of revived and expanded classical study should be modelled. In\r\nBalliol he saw nothing but a small foundation with scanty resources and\r\nwithout the making of an important home of learning. The eleemosynary\r\ncharacter of its original Statutes he left as it was, only slightly\r\nincreasing the commons of the Fellows.[27] The Master was to enjoy\r\nno greater allowance than Fellows who were Masters of Arts, but he\r\nretained the right to hold a benefice. He was no longer necessarily\r\nto be chosen from among the Fellows. The unique privilege of the\r\nCollege to elect its own Visitor--how the privilege arose we know\r\nnot--is expressly declared. But the essential changes introduced in\r\nthe Statutes of 1507 are those which gave the College a distinctively\r\ntheological complexion, and those which established a class of students\r\nin the College subordinate to the Fellows.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the Chaplains had been long rising in dignity, as\r\nshown by the fact that, though not Fellows, they had since 1477[28]\r\nbeen equally eligible with the Fellows for the office of Master. By the\r\nnew Statutes two of the Fellowships were to be filled up by persons\r\nalready in Priest’s orders to act as Chaplains. This was in part a\r\nmeasure of economy, since Fellows could be found to act as Chaplains,\r\nbut the increased importance of the latter is the more significant\r\nsince these same Statutes reduced the number of Fellows from at least\r\ntwenty-two to not less than ten. Besides this, every Fellow of the\r\nCollege was henceforth required to receive Priest’s orders within four\r\nyears after his Master’s degree. Doubtless from the beginning all the\r\nmembers of the foundation had been--as indeed all University students\r\nwere--_clerici_; but this did not necessarily imply more than the\r\nsimple taking of the tonsure. The obligation of Priest’s orders was\r\nsomething very different. The Fellows were as a rule to be Bachelors\r\nof Arts at the time of election. Their studies were limited to logic,\r\nphilosophy, and divinity; but they were free to pursue a course of\r\ncanon law in the long vacation. The Master’s degree was to be taken\r\nfour years after they had fulfilled the requirements for that of\r\nBachelor. It may be noticed that, instead of their having, according to\r\nthe modern practice, to pay fees to the College on taking degrees, they\r\nreceived from it on each occasion a gratuity varying according to the\r\ndignity of the degree.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in the number of Fellowships was evidently made in\r\norder to provide for the lower rank of what we should now-a-days call\r\nScholars. In the Statutes indeed this name is not found, for it was\r\nnot forgotten that Fellow and Scholar meant the same thing: and so the\r\nold word _scholasticus_, which was often used in the general sense\r\nof a “student,” was now applied to designate those junior members of\r\nthe College for whom Scholar was too dignified a title. They were\r\nto be “scholastics or servitors,” not above eighteen years of age,\r\nsufficiently skilled in plain song and grammar. One was assigned to the\r\nMaster and one to each graduate Fellow, and was nominated by him; he\r\nwas his private servant. The Scholastics were to live of the remnants\r\nof the Fellows’ table, to apply themselves to the study of logic, and\r\nto attend Chapel in surplices. They had also the preference, in case\r\nof equality, in election to Fellowships. We may add that, although the\r\nposition of these Scholars (as they came to be called) unquestionably\r\nimproved greatly in the course of time, the Statute affecting them was\r\nnot revised until 1834.[29]\r\n\r\nThe Statutes throw a good deal of light on the internal administration\r\nof the College at the close of the middle ages. Of the two Deans,\r\nthe senior had charge of the Library, the junior of the Chapel; they\r\nwere also to assist the Master generally in matters of discipline.\r\nThe Master, Fellows, and Scholastics were bound on Sundays and\r\nFeast-days to attend matins, with lauds, mass, vespers, and compline;\r\nand any Fellow who absented himself was liable to a fine of twopence,\r\nwhile Scholastics were punished with a flogging or otherwise at the\r\ndiscretion of the Master and Dean. The senior Dean presided at the\r\ndisputations in Logic, which were held on Saturdays weekly throughout\r\nthe term, except in Lent, and attended by the Bachelors, Scholastics,\r\nand junior Masters. The more important disputations in philosophy were\r\nheld on Wednesdays, and were not intermitted in Lent. They were even\r\nheld during the long vacation until the 7th September. At these all the\r\nFellows were to be present, and the Master or senior Fellow to preside.\r\nTheological disputations were also to be held weekly or fortnightly in\r\nterm so long as there were three Fellows who were theologians to make\r\na quorum. The College was empowered to receive boarders not on the\r\nfoundation--what we now call commoners or persons who pay for their\r\ncommons,--on the condition of their following the prescribed course of\r\nstudy (or in special cases reading civil or canon law); and the fact of\r\ntheir paying seems to have given them a choice of rooms.\r\n\r\nThe Bible or one of the Fathers was to be read in hall during\r\ndinner, and all conversation to be in Latin, unless addressed to\r\none--presumably a guest or a servant--ignorant of the language. French\r\nwas not permitted, as it was at Queen’s,[30] but the Master might\r\ngive leave to speak English on state occasions,--evidently on such a\r\nfeast as that of Saint Catherine’s day, when guests were invited and\r\nan extraordinary allowance of 3_s._ 4_d._ was made. The condition of\r\nresidence was strictly enforced; nevertheless _in order that when, as\r\nofttimes comes to pass, a season of pestilence rages, the Muses be not\r\nsilent nor study and teaching of none effect by reason of the strength\r\nof fear and peril_, it was permitted that the members of the College\r\nshould withdraw into the country, to a more salubrious place not\r\ndistant more than twelve miles from Oxford, and there dwell together\r\nand carry on their life of study and their accustomed disputations\r\nso long as the plague should last.[31] The gates of the College were\r\nclosed at nine in summer and eight in winter, and the keys deposited\r\nwith the Master until the morning. Whoever spent the night out of\r\nCollege or entered except by the gate, was punished, a Fellow by a fine\r\nof twelve pence, a Scholastic by a flogging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now sketched the constitutional history of the College to the\r\nend of the middle ages, we have now to mention a few facts of interest\r\nduring that time. These group themselves first round the name of John\r\nWycliffe the reformer of religion, and then round the band of learned\r\nmen and patrons of learning, the reformers of classical study, in the\r\ncentury after him.\r\n\r\nIn 1360 and 1361 John Wycliffe is mentioned in the College muniments\r\nas Master of Balliol. That this was the famous teacher and preacher is\r\nnot disputed, but there has been much controversy as to his earlier\r\nhistory. That he began his University life at Queen’s is indeed known\r\nto be a mistake; but the entry of the name in the bursar’s rolls at\r\nMerton under the date June 1356 has led many to believe that he was a\r\nFellow of that College. It seems nearly certain that there were two\r\nJohn Wycliffes at Oxford at the time; and since the Master of Balliol\r\ncould only be elected from among the Fellows, the inference seems\r\nclear that the Wycliffe who was Master of Balliol cannot have been\r\nFellow of Merton. Besides, it has been pointed out that Wycliffe the\r\nreformer’s descent from a family settled hard by Barnard Castle, the\r\nhome of the Balliols, would naturally lead him to enter the Balliol\r\nfoundation at Oxford; there was another Wycliffe also at Balliol,\r\nand three members of the College--one himself Master--were given the\r\nbenefice of Wycliffe-upon-Tees between 1363 and 1369. Fellowships were\r\nobtained by personal influence, and ties of this kind would easily\r\nhelp his admission. Moreover, it was not common for a northerner to\r\nenter a College like Merton, which appears in fact to have formed the\r\nhead-quarters of the southern party at Oxford.[32]\r\n\r\nWhatever be the truth in this matter, Wycliffe’s connection with\r\nBalliol is scarcely a matter of high importance. Men did not in those\r\ndays receive their education within the College walls. The College was\r\nthe boarding-house where they dwelt, where they were maintained, and\r\nwhere they attended divine service. It is true that disputations were\r\nrequired to take place within the House; but this was only to ensure\r\ntheir regularity. It was an affair of _discipline_, not of tuition,\r\nfor the College tutor was an officer undreamt of in those days; the\r\nduty of the Principal on these occasions was only to announce the\r\nsubject, to preside over the discussion, and to keep order. Nor again\r\nwas Wycliffe Master for more than a short time. He was elected after\r\n1356, and he resigned his post shortly after accepting the College\r\nliving of Fillingham in 1361. When in later years he lived in Oxford\r\nhe took up his abode elsewhere than in Balliol; perhaps at Queen’s,\r\nthen, according to many, at Canterbury Hall, finally at Black Hall:\r\nBalliol, it should seem, at that time had room only for members of the\r\nfoundation. The chief interest residing in his connection with the\r\nCollege lies in the fact, to which we have alluded, that his great\r\nexemplar, Richard FitzRalph, had been a Fellow of it about the time\r\nof Wycliffe’s birth, and was probably still resident in Oxford when\r\nWycliffe came up as a freshman.\r\n\r\nThe age succeeding Wycliffe’s death is the most barren time in the\r\nhistory of the University. Scholastic philosophy had lost its vitality\r\nand become over-elaborated into a trivial formalism. Logic had ceased\r\nto act as a stimulus to the intellectual powers, and had rather become\r\na clog upon their exercise; and men no longer framed syllogisms to\r\ndevelop their thoughts, but argued first and thought, if at all,\r\nafterwards. When, however, towards the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe revival of learning which we associate with the name of humanism\r\nbegan to influence English students, it was not those who stayed in\r\nEngland who caught its spirit, but those who were able to pursue a\r\nsecond student’s course in Italy, and there devote their zeal to the\r\nhalf-forgotten stores of classical Latin literature and the unknown\r\ntreasure-house of Greek. It was only the ebb of the humanistic movement\r\nwhich in England, as in Germany, turned to refresh and invigorate the\r\nstudy of theology. In the earlier phase, so far as it affected England,\r\nBalliol College took a foremost position, though indeed there is less\r\nevidence of this activity among the resident members of the House than\r\namong those who had passed from it to become the patrons and pioneers\r\nof a younger generation of scholars. They were almost all travelled\r\nmen, who collected manuscripts and had them copied for them, founded\r\nlibraries and sowed the seed for others to reap the fruit.\r\n\r\nFirst among these in time and in dignity was Humphrey Duke of\r\nGloucester, the Good Duke Humphrey, by whose munificence the University\r\nLibrary grew from a small number of volumes chained on desks in the\r\nupper chamber of the Congregation House at Saint Mary’s,[33] into a\r\ncollection of some six hundred manuscripts, of unique value, because,\r\nunlike the existing cathedral and monastic libraries, it was formed at\r\nthe time when attention was being again devoted to classical learning\r\nand with the help of the foreign scholars, whose work the Duke loved\r\nto encourage, and whom he employed to transcribe and collect for\r\nhim. His library contained little theology; it was rich in classical\r\nLatin literature, in Arabic science (in translations), and in the new\r\nliterature of Italy, counting at least five volumes of Boccaccio, seven\r\nof Petrarch, and two of Dante.[34] Unhappily the whole library was\r\nwrecked and brought to nothing in the violence of the reign of King\r\nEdward the Sixth, and the three volumes which are now preserved in\r\nthe re-founded University Library of Sir Thomas Bodley were recovered\r\npiecemeal from those who had obtained possession of them in the great\r\ndays of plunder.[35] That Duke Humphrey was a member of Balliol College\r\nis attested by Leland[36] and Bale,[37] but further evidence is wanting.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time as the University Library was thus enriched,\r\nfive Englishmen are mentioned as students at Ferrara under the\r\nillustrious teacher Guarino:[38] four of the five are claimed by our\r\nCollege, William Grey, John Tiptoft, John Free, and John Gunthorpe.\r\nOf these, two were men of letters and munificent patrons of learning,\r\nthe third was himself a scholar of high repute, and the last combined,\r\nperhaps in a lesser degree, the characteristics of both classes.\r\nWilliam Grey stands in a peculiarly close relation with the College.\r\nA member of the noble house of Codnor, he resided for a long time at\r\nCologne in princely style, and maintained a magnificent household.\r\nHere he studied logic, philosophy, and theology. He was Chancellor of\r\nthe University of Oxford from 1440 to 1442, and then went forth again\r\nfor a more prolonged course of study in Italy, at Florence, Padua,\r\nand Ferrara. Removing in 1449 to Rome, as proctor for King Henry the\r\nSixth, he lived there an honoured member of the learned society in\r\nthe papal city, and continued to collect manuscripts and to have them\r\ntranscribed and illuminated under his eyes, until he was recalled in\r\n1454 to the Bishopric of Ely. It was his devotion to humanism and his\r\npatronage of learned men that naturally found favour with Pope Nicolas\r\nthe Fifth, and his elevation to the see of Ely was the Pope’s act.\r\nAfter his return to England he was not regardless of the affairs of\r\nState,--indeed for a time in 1469 and 1470 he was Lord Treasurer,--but\r\nhis paramount interest still lay in his books and his circle of\r\nscholars, himself credited with a knowledge not only of Greek but of\r\nHebrew. It was his desire that his library should be preserved within\r\nthe walls of his old College. One of its members, Robert Abdy, heartily\r\ncoöperated with him, and the books--some two hundred in number, and\r\nincluding a _printed_ copy of Josephus,--were safely housed in a new\r\nbuilding erected for the purpose, probably just before the Bishop’s\r\ndeath in 1478. Many of the codices were unhappily destroyed during\r\nthe reign of King Edward the Sixth, and by Wood’s time few of the\r\nminiatures in the remaining volumes had escaped mutilation.[39] But it\r\nis a good testimony to the loyal spirit in which the College kept the\r\ntrust committed to them, that no less than a hundred and fifty-two of\r\nGrey’s manuscripts are still in its possession.[40]\r\n\r\nPart of the building in which the library was to find a home was\r\nalready in existence. The ground-floor, and perhaps the dining-hall\r\n(now the library reading-room) adjoining, are attributed to Thomas\r\nChase, who had been Master from 1412 to 1423, and was Chancellor of\r\nthe University from 1426 to 1430. It was the upper part of the library\r\nwhich was expressly built for the purpose of receiving Bishop Grey’s\r\nbooks, and it was the work of Abdy, who as Fellow and then, from 1477\r\nto 1494, as Master devoted himself to the enlargement and adornment of\r\nthe College buildings, Grey helping him liberally with money. On more\r\nthan one of the library windows their joint bounty was commemorated:--\r\n\r\n    Hos Deus adiecit, Deus his det gaudia celi:\r\n    Abdy perfecit opus hoc Gray presul et Ely.\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n    Conditor ecce novi structus huius fuit Abdy:\r\n    Presul et huic Hely Gray libros contulit edi.\r\n\r\nThe bishop’s coat of arms may still be seen on the panels below the\r\ngreat window of the old solar, now the Master’s dining-hall; and\r\nelsewhere in the new buildings might be seen the arms of George\r\nNevill, Archbishop of York, the brother of the King-Maker, who was\r\nalso a member, and would thus appear to have been a benefactor, of\r\nthe College.[41] The future Archbishop was made Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity in 1453 when he was barely twenty-two years of age.[42] His\r\ninstallation banquet, the particulars of which may be read in Savage’s\r\n_Balliofergus_,[43] was of a prodigality to which it would be hard to\r\nfind a parallel: it consisted of nine hundred messes of meat, with\r\ntwelve hundred hogsheads of beer and four hundred and sixteen of wine;\r\nand if, as it appears, it was held within the College, the resources\r\nof the house must have been severely taxed to make provision for the\r\nentertainment of the company, which included twenty-two noblemen,\r\nseventeen bishops and abbots, a number of noble ladies, and a multitude\r\nof other guests, not to speak of more than two thousand servants.\r\n\r\nThe other Balliol scholars who followed the instruction of Guarino at\r\nFerrara were a good deal younger than Grey; for Guarino lived on until\r\n1460, when he died at the age of ninety. Tiptoft, who was created Earl\r\nof Worcester in his twenty-second year, in 1449, was an enthusiastic\r\ntraveller. He set out first to Jerusalem; returned to Venice, and then\r\nspent several years in study at Ferrara, Padua, and Rome.[44] During\r\nthis time he collected manuscripts wherever he could lay hands on\r\nthem, and formed a precious library, with which he afterwards endowed\r\nthe University of Oxford: its value was reckoned at no less than five\r\nhundred marks.[45] His later career as Treasurer and High Constable\r\nbelongs to the public history of England. It is to be lamented that\r\nhe brought back from the Italian _renaissance_ a spirit of cruelty\r\nand recklessness of giving pain, unknown to the humaner middle ages,\r\nwhich made him one of the first victims of the revolution that restored\r\nKing Henry the Sixth to the throne. But in his death the cause of\r\nletters received a blow such as we can only compare with that which\r\nit suffered by the execution of the Earl of Surrey in the last days\r\nof King Henry the Eighth. It is a strange coincidence that one of the\r\nleaders of the restoration movement, one of those chiefly chargeable\r\nwith Tiptoft’s death, was his own Balliol contemporary, Archbishop\r\nNevill, the new Lord Chancellor.[46]\r\n\r\nJohn Free, who graduated in 1450,[47] was a Fellow of Balliol College,\r\nand was afterwards a Doctor of Medicine of Padua. During a life spent\r\nin Italy he became famous as a poet and a Greek scholar, a civilist\r\nand a physician.[48] Pope Paul the Second made him Bishop of Bath and\r\nWells, but he died almost immediately, in 1465.[49] Gunthorpe was his\r\ncompanion in study at Ferrara, and he too became distinguished as a\r\nscholar: but he was still more a collector of books, some of which he\r\ngave to Jesus College, Cambridge--at one time he was Warden of the\r\nKing’s Hall in that University,--while others came to several libraries\r\nat Oxford. Gunthorpe is best known as a man of affairs, a diplomatist\r\nand minister of state. He became Dean of Wells, and is still remembered\r\nin that city by the _guns_ with which he adorned the Deanery he\r\nbuilt.[50] He survived all his fellow-scholars we have named, and died\r\nin 1498.[51]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the middle ages down to the present century Balliol\r\nCollege presents none of those characteristics of distinction which\r\nwe have remarked in the fifteenth century. During this time, indeed,\r\nalthough in the nature of things a large number of men of note\r\ncontinued to receive their education at Oxford, there was no College\r\nor Colleges which could be said to occupy anything like a position\r\nof peculiar eminence or dignity. In the general decline of learning,\r\neducation, and manners, Balliol College appears even to have sunk below\r\nmost of its rivals, and its annals show little more than a dreary\r\nrecord of lazy torpor and bad living.[52] The Statutes of the College\r\nreceived no alterations of importance. Its power to choose its own\r\nVisitor was indeed for a time overridden by the Bishop of Lincoln, who\r\nwas considered _ex officio_ Visitor until Bishop Barlow’s death in\r\n1691;[53] and the _Scholastici_ became distinguished as _Scholares_\r\nfrom an inferior rank of _Servitores_ with which the Statutes of 1507\r\nhad identified them. Another lower class of students, called Batellers,\r\nalso came into existence. Every Commoner was required by a rule of 1574\r\nto be under the Master or one of the Fellows as his Tutor;[54] Scholars\r\nbeing apparently _ipso facto_ subject to the Fellows who nominated\r\nthem. In 1610 it was ordered, with the Visitor’s consent, that Fellow\r\nCommoners might be admitted to the College and be free from “public\r\ncorrection,” except in the case of scandalous offences; they were not\r\nbound to exhibit reverence to the Fellows in the quadrangle unless they\r\nencountered them face to face,--_reverentiam Sociis in quadrangulo\r\nconsuetam non nisi in occursu praestent_. Every such Commoner was\r\nbound to pay at least five pounds on admission for the purchase of\r\nplate or books for the College.[55] The sum was in 1691 raised to ten\r\npounds.[56] As the disputations in hall tended to become less and less\r\nof a reality, and the lectures in the schools became a pure matter of\r\nroutine for the younger Masters, provision had to be made for something\r\nin the way of regular lectures, but fixed tuition-fees were not yet\r\ninvented, and so the richest living in the gift of the College--that\r\nof Fillingham in Lincolnshire, which had been usually held by the\r\nMaster and was now attached to his office--was in 1571 charged with the\r\npayment of £8 13_s._.4_d._ to three Prelectors chosen by the College\r\nwho should lecture in hall on Greek, dialectic, and rhetoric.[57] The\r\nlectures, it was soon after decided, were to be held at least thrice\r\na week during term, except on Feast Days or when the lecturer was\r\nill. Any one who failed to fulfil his duty--either in person or by a\r\ndeputy--was to pay twopence _to be consumed by the other Fellows at\r\ndinner or supper on the Sunday next following_.[58] In 1695 the famous\r\nDr. Busby, who had before shown himself a friend to the College,[59]\r\nestablished a Catechetical Lecture to be given on thirty prescribed\r\nsubjects through the year, at which all members of the College were\r\nbound to be present.[60] This Lecture was maintained until recent years.\r\n\r\nDuring the two centuries following the reign of King Edward the Third\r\nthe College had received little or no addition to its corporate\r\nendowments, though, as we have seen, it had been largely helped by\r\ndonations towards its buildings, and above all by the foundation of\r\nits precious library.[61] Between the date of the accession of Queen\r\nElizabeth and the year 1677, in the renewed zeal for academical\r\nfoundations which marked that period, the College received a number\r\nof new benefactions; and these introduced a new element into its\r\ncomposition. Hitherto all the Fellowships had been open without\r\nrestriction of place of birth or education; and although it is likely\r\nthat the College in its earlier days drew its recruits mainly from the\r\nnorth of England, yet there was nothing in the Statutes to authorize\r\nthe connection. The College, it is true, was a very close corporation,\r\nfor Fellow nominated Scholar, and out of the Scholars the Fellows\r\nwere generally elected. Still, in contradistinction to the majority\r\nof Colleges, there were no local limitations upon eligibility to\r\nScholarships. The new endowments, on the other hand, with the exception\r\nof those of the Lady Periam, were all so limited. First, by a bequest\r\nof Dr. John Bell, formerly Bishop of Worcester, two Scholarships\r\nconfined to natives of his diocese were founded in 1559,[62] and in\r\n1605 Sir William Dunch established another for the benefit of Abingdon\r\nSchool.[63] A little later Balliol nearly became possessed of the much\r\nlarger endowment, of seven Fellowships and six Scholarships, attached\r\nto the same school by William Tisdale. Indeed part of the money was\r\npaid over, six Scholars were appointed, and Cesar’s lodgings--of which\r\nmore hereafter--were bought for their reception.[64] But a subsequent\r\narrangement diverted the endowment, which in 1624 helped to change the\r\nancient Broadgates Hall into Pembroke College.[65] In the meanwhile\r\na more considerable benefaction, also connected with a local school,\r\naccrued to Balliol between 1601 and 1615, when in execution of the will\r\nof Peter Blundell one Fellowship and one Scholarship were founded to\r\nbe held by persons educated at Blundell’s Grammar School at Tiverton,\r\nand nominated by the Trustees of the School.[66] The next endowment\r\nin order of time was that of Elizabeth, widow of Chief Baron Periam\r\nand sister of Francis Bacon. The nomination to the Fellowship and two\r\nScholarships which she founded in 1620, she reserved to herself for her\r\nlifetime; afterwards they were to be filled up in the same manner as\r\nthe other Fellowships of the College.[67]\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration two separate benefactions set up that close\r\nconnection between the College and Scotland which saved Balliol from\r\nsinking into utter obscurity in the century following, and which has\r\nsince contributed to it a large share of its later fame. Bishop Warner\r\nof Rochester, who died in 1666, bequeathed to the College the annual\r\nsum of eighty pounds for the support of four scholars from Scotland to\r\nbe chosen by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Rochester;\r\nand about ten years later certain Exhibitions were founded by Mr.\r\nJohn Snell for persons nominated by Glasgow University. The latter\r\nvaried in number according to the proceeds of Mr. Snell’s estate; at\r\none time they were as many as ten and of the yearly value of £116,\r\nbut their number and value have since been reduced. Both of these\r\nfoundations were expressly designed to promote the interests of the\r\nEpiscopal Church in Scotland.[68] Their importance in the history of\r\nthe College cannot be overestimated, and it is to them that it owes\r\nsuch names among its members as Adam Smith, Sir William Hamilton, and\r\nArchbishop Tait, to say nothing of a great company of distinguished\r\nScotsmen now living. The Exhibitioners have also as a rule offered an\r\nadmirable example of frugal habits and hard work; and perhaps it was\r\nin consideration of their national thriftiness that the rooms assigned\r\nthem are noticed in 1791 as mean and incommodious.[69]\r\n\r\nAmong more recent benefactions to the College the most important is\r\nthat of Miss Hannah Brakenbury who, besides the questionable service of\r\ncontributing towards the rebuilding of the front quadrangle, endowed\r\neight Scholarships for the encouragement of the studies of Law and\r\nModern History. Nor should we omit to mention the two Exhibitions of\r\n£100 a-year each, founded under the will of Richard Jenkyns, formerly\r\nMaster, which are awarded by examination to members of the College,\r\nand the list of holders of which is of exceptional brilliancy. But in\r\nrecent years the number of Scholarships and Exhibitions has been most\r\nof all increased not by means of any specific endowment but by savings\r\nfrom the annual internal income of the College. In pursuance of the\r\nordinances of the Universities’ Commission of 1877, Balliol became\r\nthe owner of New Inn Hall on the death of its late Principal; and the\r\nproceeds of the sale of the Hall, when effected, are to be applied to\r\nthe establishment of Exhibitions for poor students.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now resume the history of the College buildings. We have seen that\r\nthe Chapel was built early in the reign of King Edward the Third,\r\nand that the hall and library buildings were added in the following\r\ncentury.[70] A new Chapel was built between 1521 and 1529,[71] which\r\nlasted until the present century. It contained a muniment-room or\r\ntreasury, “which,” says Anthony Wood, “is a kind of vestry, joyning on\r\nthe S. side of the E. end of the chappel;”[72] and there was a window\r\nopening into it, as at Corpus, from the library.[73] With the present\r\nChapel in one’s mind it is hard to estimate the loss which from a\r\npicturesque point of view the College has suffered by the destruction\r\nof its predecessor. In modern times Oxford has ever been a prey to\r\narchitects. The rebuilding of Queen’s is an example of what happily\r\nwas not carried into effect at Magdalen and Brasenose in the last\r\ncentury; but in the present, Balliol is almost peculiar in the extent\r\nto which these depredations have run, and those who remember the line\r\nof buildings of the Chapel and library as they looked from the Fellows’\r\ngarden say that for harmony and quiet charm they were of their kind\r\nunsurpassed in Oxford. Among the special features of the old Chapel\r\nwere the painted windows, particularly the great east window given by\r\nLawrence Stubbs in 1529. The fragments of this are distributed among\r\nthe side windows of the modern Chapel, and even in their scattered\r\nstate are highly regarded by lovers of glass-painting.[74] Of the\r\nlater buildings of the College, “Cesar’s lodgings” must not pass\r\nwithout notice. It had its name from Henry Caesar, afterwards Dean\r\nof Carlisle--the brother of Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls\r\n(1614-1636),--and stood opposite to where the “Martyrs’ Memorial” now\r\nis. Being currently known as _Cesar_, an opposite stack of buildings\r\nto the south of it was naturally called _Pompey_. The two were pulled\r\ndown, not before it was necessary, in the second quarter of the present\r\ncentury.[75] Hammond’s lodgings, which came to the College in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s time, and stood on the site of the old Master’s little\r\ngarden and the present Master’s house, were occupied by the Blundell\r\nand Periam Fellows.[76]\r\n\r\nBefore the front of the College was a close, planted with trees like\r\nthat in front of St. John’s.\r\n\r\n    “Stant Baliolenses maiore cacumine moles,\r\n    Et sua frondosis praetexunt atria ramis;\r\n    Nec tamen idcirco Trinam sprevere minorem\r\n    Aut sibi subiectam comitem sponsamve recusant--”\r\n\r\nran some verses of 1667.[77] But if we may judge from a story to be\r\ntold hereafter of the respective prosperity of the two Colleges, it\r\nwas rather Trinity which had the right to look down upon its rival at\r\nthat time. In the eighteenth century the buildings of Balliol were\r\nconsiderably enlarged by the erection of two staircases westward of\r\nthe Master’s house, by Mr. Fisher of Beere, and of three running\r\nnorth of these over against St. Mary Magdalen Church. The fronts of\r\nthe east side of the quadrangle, reputed to be the most ancient part\r\nof the College, and of part of the south side adjoining it, were\r\nrebuilt.[78] The direction of the hall was reversed, so that instead of\r\nthe passage into the garden, the entrance to the hall, and the buttery\r\nbeing beneath the Master’s lodgings, they were placed on the northern\r\nextremity of the hall.[79] In the present reign a further addition to\r\nthe College was made in the place of the dilapidated “Cesar,” and with\r\nit a back porch with a tower above it was built. Then followed the\r\nrebuilding of the Chapel and, after an interval, of two sides of the\r\nfront quadrangle and of the Master’s house. A little later the garden\r\nwas gradually enclosed by buildings on the north side, which were\r\ncompleted in 1877 by a hall with common room, buttery, kitchen, and a\r\nchemical laboratory beneath it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to obtain any accurate knowledge of the number\r\nof persons ordinarily inhabiting a College in past times. A few lists\r\nhappen to have been preserved, but their accuracy is not free from\r\nsuspicion. Thus, a census of 1552 enumerates under the head of Balliol\r\nseven Masters, six Bachelors, and seventeen others, these seventeen\r\nincluding the manciple, butler, cook, and scullion.[80] In ten years\r\nthis list of thirty names has grown to sixty-five: six Masters,\r\nthirteen Bachelors, and forty-six others, eight of whom were Scholars,\r\nfive “poor scholars”--presumably batellers,--and four servants.[81]\r\nBy 1612 the number appears to have nearly doubled, and comprises the\r\nMaster and eleven Fellows, thirteen Scholars, seventy commoners,\r\ntwenty-two “poor scholars,” and ten servants; in all a hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven:[82] a total the magnitude of which is the more perplexing\r\nsince the College matriculations between 1575 and 1621 averaged hardly\r\nmore than fifteen a-year.[83] No doubt, in the days when several\r\nstudents shared a bedroom, it was possible even for a small College\r\nto give house-room to a far larger number than we can imagine at the\r\npresent time; but still it is hard to understand how so many as a\r\nhundred and twenty persons could be accommodated in the then existing\r\nbuildings of Balliol. According to the procuratorial cycle of 1629,\r\nBalliol ranks with University, Lincoln, Jesus, and Pembroke, among the\r\nsmallest Colleges.[84] In recent times, taking years by chance, we\r\nfind the number of Fellows, Scholars, and Commoners in the _University\r\nCalendar_ for 1838 to be 102, in that for 1859 to be 122, in 1878\r\nabout 195, and in 1891 about 187.[85] That the College has been able\r\nto count so many resident members is partly owing to the extension of\r\nthe College buildings, but much more to the modern Statute whereby all\r\nmembers of the College are not necessarily required to live within the\r\nCollege walls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotices of the domestic history of Balliol during the sixteenth,\r\nseventeenth, and eighteenth centuries are surprisingly scanty. In the\r\nfollowing pages we have gathered together such particulars as we have\r\nthought of sufficient interest to be recorded in a brief sketch like\r\nthe present. Early in the seventeenth century the life of the College\r\nwas varied by the presence of two Greek students, sent over by Cyril\r\nLucaris, the Patriarch of Constantinople, to whom England owes the\r\ngift of the Codex Alexandrinus. One of these, Metrophanes Critopulos,\r\nbecame Patriarch of Alexandria. The other, Nathaniel Conopios, we\r\nare told “spake and wrote the genuine Greek (for which he was had\r\nin great Veneration in his Country), others using the vulgar only,”\r\nand was a proficient in music. He took the degree of B.D., and was\r\nmade Bishop of Smyrna. Evelyn remarks that he was the first he “ever\r\nsaw drink coffee, w^{ch} custom came not into England until 30 years\r\nafter.”[86] Our next note is of a different character. Soon after the\r\nScholars endowed by Tisdale[87] were established in Cesar’s lodgings,\r\na dispute arose between one of them, named Crabtree, and Ferryman\r\nMoore, a freshman of three weeks’ standing. Crabtree called Moore an\r\n“undergraduate” and pulled his hair; whereupon Moore drew his knife\r\nand stabbed him so that he died. In the trial that followed Moore\r\npleaded benefit of clergy and was condemned to burning in the hand,\r\nbut at the petition of the Vice-Chancellor, Mayor, and other Justices,\r\nreceived the Royal pardon on the 19th November, 1624,--the very year\r\nin which the benefaction that had brought his victim to Balliol was\r\nsettled in its lasting home in Pembroke College.[88] A little later,\r\nin 1631, we find one Thorne, a member of Balliol, preaching at St.\r\nMary’s against the King’s Declaration on Religion of 1628: he was\r\nexpelled the University by Royal order.[89] The famous John Evelyn,\r\nwho was admitted a Fellow Commoner of the College in May 1637, being\r\nthen in his seventeenth year, tells us that “the Fellow Com’uners in\r\nBalliol were no more exempt from Exercise than the meanest scholars\r\nthere, and my Father sent me thither to one Mr. George Bradshaw,” who\r\nwas Master from 1648 to 1651. “I ever,” he adds, “thought my Tutor\r\nhad parts enough, but as his ambition made him much suspected of y^{e}\r\nCollege, so his grudge to Dr. Lawrence, the governor of it (whom he\r\nafterwards supplanted), tooke up so much of his tyme, that he seldom or\r\nnever had the opportunity to discharge his duty to his scholars. This\r\nI perceiving, associated myself with one Mr. James Thicknesse, (then\r\na young man of the Foundation, afterwards a Fellow of the House,) by\r\nwhose learned and friendly conversation I received great advantage. At\r\nmy first arrival, Dr. Parkhurst was Master; and after his discease, Dr.\r\nLawrence, a chaplaine of his Ma’ties and Margaret Professor, succeeded,\r\nan acute and learned person; nor do I much reproach his severity,\r\nconsidering that the extraordinary remissenesse of discipline had\r\n(til his coming) much detracted from the reputation of that Colledg.”\r\nLater Evelyn mentions that his Tutor managed his expenses during his\r\nfirst year. In January 1640 “Came my Bro. Richard from schole to be my\r\nchamber-fellow at the University,” so that even Fellow Commoners did\r\nnot always have rooms to themselves. It is noticeable that the chief\r\nstudies which Evelyn speaks of engaging in are those of “the dauncing\r\nand vaulting Schole” and music; and one is not surprised to read that\r\nwhen he quitted Oxford in April 1640, without taking a degree, and made\r\nhis residence in the Middle Temple, he should observe, “My being at the\r\nUniversity, in regard of these avocations, was of very small benefit to\r\nme.”[90]\r\n\r\nWhen King Charles was at Oxford, Balliol, with the great majority of\r\nColleges, handed over its plate to him, 20 January 1642/3. The weight\r\nof the metal was only 41 _lb._ 4 _oz._, less than that of any other\r\nCollege recorded.[91] When the Parliamentary Visitation began in 1647.\r\nThomas Lawrence was Master and also Margaret Professor of Divinity.\r\nAfter a while he submitted to the Visitors’ authority and then resigned\r\nhis offices. In the Mastership he was succeeded by George Bradshaw,\r\nEvelyn’s tutor.[92] Apparently about half the members of the College in\r\ntime made their submission.[93] From 1651 the Mastership was held by\r\nHenry Savage, a man of cultivation, who had travelled in France, and\r\nhere at least deserves to be remembered as the author of the first and\r\nonly history of his College, a work to which we have been constantly\r\nindebted for its transcripts and extracts from the muniments.[94] On\r\nhis death in 1672 he was succeeded by Thomas Good,--one of the first\r\nof those who submitted to the Parliamentary Visitors[95]--whom Wood\r\ndescribes as when resident in College “a frequent preacher, yet always\r\nesteemed an honest and harmless puritan.”[96] He is best known from\r\nthe stories which Humphrey Prideaux tells about him. According to him\r\nthe Master “is a good honest old tost, and understands business well\r\nenough, but is very often guilty of absurditys, which rendreth him\r\ncontemptible to the yong men of the town.”[97] One of these stories\r\nhe does “not well beleeve; but however you shall have it. There is\r\nover against Baliol College a dingy, horrid, scandalous alehouse, fit\r\nfor none but draymen and tinkers and such as by goeing there have made\r\nthemselves equally scandalous. Here the Baliol men continually ly,\r\nand by perpetuall bubbeing ad art to their natural stupidity to make\r\nthemselves perfect sots. The head, beeing informed of this, called\r\nthem togeather, and in a grave speech informed them of the mischiefs\r\nof that hellish liquor cald ale, that it destroyed both body and soul,\r\nand adviced them by noe means to have anything more to do with it; but\r\non of them, not willing soe tamely to be preached out of his beloved\r\nliquor, made reply that the Vice-Chancelour’s men drank ale at the\r\nSplit Crow,[98] and why should not they to? The old man, being nonplusd\r\nwith this reply, immediately packeth away to the Vice-Chancelour,[99]\r\nand informed him of the ill example his fellows gave the rest of the\r\ntown by drinkeing ale, and desired him to prohibit them for the future;\r\nbut Bathurst, not likeing his proposall, being formerly and [_sic_]\r\nold lover of ale himselfe, answared him roughly, that there was noe\r\nhurt in ale, and that as long as his fellows did noe worse he would not\r\ndisturb them, and soe turned the old man goeing; who, returneing to\r\nhis colledge, calld his fellows again and told them he had been with\r\nthe Vice-Chancelour, and that he told them there was noe hurt in ale;\r\ntruely he thought there was, but now, beeing informed of the contrary,\r\nsince the Vice-Chancelour gave his men leave to drinke ale, he would\r\ngive them leave to; soe that now they may be sots by authority.”[100]\r\n\r\nAnother story of the same time connecting Balliol and Trinity Colleges\r\nis told of Dr. Bathurst, President of Trinity and the “Vice-Chancelour”\r\nnamed in the foregoing quotation. “A striking instance,” says Thomas\r\nWarton, “of zeal for his college, in the dotage of old age, is yet\r\nremembered. Balliol College had suffered so much in the outrages of the\r\ngrand rebellion, that it remained almost in a state of desolation for\r\nsome years after the restoration: a circumstance not to be suspected\r\nfrom its flourishing condition ever since. Dr. Bathurst was perhaps\r\nsecretly pleased to see a neighbouring, and once rival society,\r\nreduced to this condition, while his own flourished beyond all others.\r\nAccordingly, one afternoon he was found in his garden, which then ran\r\nalmost contiguous to the east side of Balliol-college, throwing stones\r\nat the windows with much satisfaction, as if happy to contribute his\r\nshare in completing the appearance of its ruin.”[101]\r\n\r\nIndeed, that Balliol was by no means in a state of prosperity after\r\nthe Restoration may be gathered from the facts that it is described\r\nas possessing but half the income of Exeter, Oriel, and Queen’s, and\r\ncontaining but twenty-five commoners;[102] and that in 1681 the College\r\nwas taken by the opposition Peers for lodgings during the Oxford\r\nParliament.[103] In January the Earl of Shaftesbury, together with the\r\nDuke of Monmouth, the Earls of Bedford and Essex, and twelve other\r\nPeers, subscribed a petition praying that the Parliament should sit\r\nnot at Oxford but at Westminster; and when they found they could not\r\nmove the King, Shaftesbury promptly set about securing rooms at Oxford.\r\nJohn Locke, who conducted negotiations for him, reported on the 6th\r\nFebruary that the Rector of Exeter would be happy to place three rooms\r\nin his house at his Lordship’s disposal, “but that the whole college\r\ncould by no means be had.” Dr. Wallis’s house was also inspected, and\r\nit was soon discovered that Balliol College was at the Peers’ service.\r\nFrom a letter however from Shaftesbury to Locke, of the 22nd February,\r\nit seems that he himself and Lord Grey occupied Wallis’s house, and\r\n“dieted” elsewhere, no doubt at Balliol.[104] On their departure\r\nShaftesbury and fourteen other Peers--almost exactly the same list as\r\nthat of the petitioners of the 25th January--presented to the College\r\n“a large bole, with a cover to it, all double guilt, 167 _oz._ 10\r\n_dwts_,”[105] which was melted down into tankards many years since.\r\n\r\nThe history of the College during the greater part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury coincides with the life of Dr. Theophilus Leigh, who took his\r\nBachelor’s degree from Corpus in 1712, was appointed Master of Balliol\r\nfifteen years later, and held his office until 1785. Hearne records the\r\ncircumstances of his election in a way which implies that he owed his\r\nsuccess to an informality, with more than a hint of nepotism on the\r\npart of the Visitor.[106] Six years after his death Martin Routh was\r\nelected President of Magdalen College. He died in 1855; so that the\r\nacademical lives of these two men overlapping just at the extremities\r\ncover a period of not less than a hundred and forty-six years. In\r\nLeigh’s days Balliol was sunk in the heavy and sluggish decrepitude\r\nwhich characterized Oxford at large. The _Terrae Filius_--doubtless\r\nan authority to be received with caution--reviles the Fellows for\r\nthe perpetual fines and sconces with which they burthened the\r\nundergraduates;[107] and it is stated that Adam Smith, when a member\r\nof the College, was severely reprimanded for reading Hume.[108] It is\r\ncertain that, at least when Leigh was first a Fellow, the College did\r\nnot even trust the undergraduates with knives and forks, for these, we\r\nare assured, were chained to the table in hall, while the trenchers\r\nwere made of wood.[109] There was “a laudable custom” which lasted\r\non to a later generation “of the Dean’s Visiting the Undergraduats\r\nChambers at 9 o’ Clock at Night, to see that they kept good hours.”[110]\r\n\r\nIt was before nine o’clock on the 23rd February 1747-8 that a party\r\nwas gathered there which led to serious consequences. In spite of the\r\nfailure of the rebellion of 1745 the zealous ardour of some Jacobite\r\nmembers of the College waxed so warm that they and their guests paraded\r\ndown the Turl shouting _G--d bless k--g J----s_, until they reached\r\nWinter’s coffee-house near the High Street, where Mr. Richard Blacow,\r\na Canon of Windsor, was sitting “in company with several Gentlemen of\r\nthe University and an Officer in his Regimental Habit,” about seven\r\no’clock in the evening. Mr. Blacow tells us with righteous indignation\r\nhow he not only heard treasonable and seditious expressions in favour\r\nof the exiled family, but also such cries as _d--n K--g G----e_. Being\r\na young Master of Arts and very much on his dignity, he went forth into\r\nthe street to check the outrage, but was only met by a rough handling\r\non the part of the rioters, who stood shouting in St. Mary Hall Lane\r\nin front of Oriel College; so that Mr. Blacow was glad to make good\r\nhis retreat within the College gate. Reappearing after a while he was\r\non the point of being attacked, when his assailant was carried off by\r\nthe Proctor. Another, Luxmoore, B.A. of Balliol, took to his heels.\r\nAfter this the loyal Canon sought in vain to induce the Vice-Chancellor\r\nto take steps for the trial of the offenders; but he could by no\r\nmeans be prevailed upon. At length, as the scandal spread abroad, the\r\nSecretary of State, the Duke of Newcastle, requested Mr. Blacow to\r\nlay an information before him; and three members of the University\r\nwere tried for treason in the King’s Bench. Of the two who belonged to\r\nBalliol one, Luxmoore, was acquitted; the other Whitmore, with Dawes of\r\nSt. Mary Hall,--both undergraduates barely twenty years of age,--were\r\nsentenced to a fine, to two years’ imprisonment, to find securities\r\nfor their good behaviour for seven years, “to walk immediately round\r\nWestminster Hall with a libel affixed to their foreheads denoting their\r\ncrime and sentence, and to ask pardon of the several courts.”[111]\r\n\r\nThe letters of Robert Southey, who entered Balliol as a commoner in\r\n1792, do not give an unfavourable impression of the condition of the\r\nCollege just after Leigh’s death. His own peculiarities of taste and\r\ntemper placed him doubtless in uncongenial surroundings,--he refused\r\nthe assistance of the College barber and wore his curly hair long,--but\r\nhis complaint is not of the College but of the University system in\r\ngeneral. The authorities are “men remarkable only for great wigs and\r\nlittle wisdom.” “With respect to its superiors, Oxford only exhibits\r\nwaste of wigs and want of wisdom; with respect to the undergraduates,\r\nevery species of abandoned excess.” In his second year, with the\r\nhaughty air of a senior man, he found the freshmen “not estimable”;\r\nbut he made friends in College, and two of his first four comrades\r\nin the great Pantisocratic scheme were Balliol men. Even his tutor,\r\nThomas Howe, delighted him by being “half a democrat,” and still more\r\nby the remark--“Mr. Southey, you won’t learn any thing by my lectures,\r\nSir; so, if you have any studies of your own, you had better pursue\r\nthem.” Rowing and swimming, Southey used to say, were all he learned\r\nat Oxford; but with two years’ residence, and a term missed in them,\r\nwith Pantisocracy and _Joan of Arc_, we may doubt whether it was all\r\nOxford’s fault.[112]\r\n\r\nThe real revival of Balliol College began after the election of John\r\nParsons as Master in 1798. He succeeded to the Vice-Chancellorship in\r\n1807 unexpectedly, on the death of Dr. Richards, Rector of Exeter,\r\nafter a single year of office. “He was a good scholar,” says Bedel Cox,\r\n“and an impressive preacher, though he did not preach often; above all,\r\nhe was thoroughly conversant with University matters, having been for\r\nseveral years the leading, or rather the working, man in the Hebdomadal\r\nBoard. Indeed, he had the great merit of elaborating the details of\r\nthe Public Examination Statute at the end of the last century. His\r\nsubsequent promotion” to the Bishopric of Peterborough “was considered\r\nas the well-earned reward of that his great work. Dr. Parsons had also\r\nthe credit of laying the foundation of that collegiate and tutorial\r\nsystem which Dr. Jenkyns afterwards so successfully carried out.”[113]\r\nThose who may think the establishment of the examination system a\r\nquestionable benefit may be comforted by knowing that for many years it\r\nwas conducted entirely _vivâ voce_, while the requirements for degrees\r\nin the time preceding the change were so notoriously perfunctory that\r\nthe old method could not possibly be maintained. In the Colleges\r\ntoo the tutorial system, in its principle--as still at Cambridge--a\r\ndisciplinary system, had long outlived its vitality; and Dr. Parsons\r\ndeserves credit not merely for invigorating it, but for setting on a\r\nfirm foundation an organization for teaching undergraduates as well as\r\nfor keeping them in order.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be expected that these reforms should bear full fruit\r\nfor many years. Sir William Hamilton, who was at Balliol from 1807 to\r\n1810, describes himself as “so plagued by these foolish lectures of the\r\nCollege tutors that I have little time to do anything else--Aristotle\r\nto-day, ditto to-morrow; and I believe that if the ideas furnished by\r\nAristotle to these numbskulls were taken away, it would be doubtful\r\nwhether there remained a single notion. I am quite tired of such\r\nuniformity of study.”[114] He was however unfortunately placed under\r\nan eccentric tutor named Powell, who lived furtively in rooms over the\r\nCollege gate and was never seen out except at dusk. “For a short time\r\nHamilton and his tutor kept up the formality of an hour’s lecture. This\r\nhowever soon ceased, and for the last three years of his College life\r\nHamilton was left to follow his own inclinations.”[115] But, as Dr.\r\nParsons said, “he is one of those, and they are rare, who are best left\r\nto themselves. He will turn out a great scholar, and we shall get the\r\ncredit of making him so, though in point of fact we shall have done\r\nnothing for him whatever.”[116] Yet in later years the philosopher\r\nspeaks of the “College in which I spent the happiest of the happy\r\nyears of youth, which is never recollected but with affection, and\r\nfrom which, as I gratefully acknowledge, I carried into life a taste\r\nfor those studies which have contributed the most interesting of my\r\nsubsequent pursuits.”[117]\r\n\r\nHamilton’s freshman’s account of the daily life and manners of the\r\nCollege deserves quotation: its date is 13 May, 1807. “No boots are\r\nallowed to be worn here, or trousers or pantaloons. In the morning we\r\nwear white cotton stockings, and before dinner regularly dress in silk\r\nstockings, &c. After dinner we go to one another’s rooms and drink some\r\nwine, then go to chapel at half-past five, and walk, or sail on the\r\nriver, after that. In the morning we go to chapel at seven, breakfast\r\nat nine, fag all the forenoon, and dine at half-past three.”[118]\r\n\r\nUnder Dr. Parsons as Master, and Mr. Jenkyns as Tutor and then\r\nVice-Master on the Head’s elevation to the see of Peterborough, the\r\nCollege continued steadily to improve. Mr. Jenkyns succeeded to the\r\nMastership on the Bishop’s death in 1819. But there were still two\r\npoints in the constitution of the College which were felt to be out\r\nof keeping with the spirit of modern education. One was the direct\r\nnomination of each Scholar, except those on the Blundell Foundation,\r\nby a particular Fellow in turn; and the other, the obligation under\r\nwhich all the Fellows lay of taking Priest’s orders. The former\r\narrangement was revised by a new Statute sanctioned by the Visitor in\r\n1834, which placed all the Scholarships, with the exception named,\r\nin the appointment of the Master and Fellows after examination. At\r\nthe same time the College yielded to the tendency of the time which\r\nbrought undergraduates to the University older than formerly, and\r\nraised the age below which candidates were admissible to scholarships\r\nfrom eighteen to nineteen.[119] The other question was settled by a\r\ndecision in 1838 that the obligation of Fellows to take holy orders\r\ndid not debar candidates from election who had no such purpose in\r\nmind, provided of course that their tenure of Fellowships terminated\r\nat the date by which according to the Statutes they were bound to be\r\nordained.[120]\r\n\r\nIn the same year that this decision was given Mr. Benjamin Jowett,\r\nafterwards Regius Professor of Greek and since 1870 Master of the\r\nCollege, was elected to a Fellowship. He has committed to writing in a\r\nmost interesting letter to the son of William George Ward, famous for\r\nhis share in the Oxford Movement and for his degradation by Convocation\r\nin 1845, his recollections of the Fellows as they were when he was\r\nelected to their membership; but we have only room here for a short\r\nextract from his account of Master Jenkyns, “who was very different\r\nfrom any of the Fellows, and was held in considerable awe by them.\r\nHe was a gentleman of the old school, in whom were represented old\r\nmanners, old traditions, old prejudices, a Tory and a Churchman, high\r\nand dry, without much literature, but having a good deal of character.\r\nHe filled a great space in the eyes of the undergraduates. ‘His young\r\nmen,’ as he termed them, speaking in an accent which we all remember,\r\nwere never tired of mimicking his voice, drawing his portrait, and\r\ninventing stories about what he said and did.… He was a considerable\r\nactor, and would put on severe looks to terrify Freshmen, but he was\r\nreally kind-hearted and indulgent to them. He was in a natural state\r\nof war with the Fellows and Scholars on the Close Foundation; and many\r\nludicrous stories were told of his behaviour to them, of his dislike\r\nto smoking, and of his enmity to dogs.… He was much respected, and his\r\ngreat services to the College have always been acknowledged.”[121]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the progress made by Balliol College during the years\r\nbetween 1813, when Jenkyns became Vice-Master, and 1854, when he\r\ndied, we may perhaps venture to question whether the balance between\r\n“old manners, old traditions, old prejudices,” and new manners, new\r\ntraditions, new prejudices, does not hang very evenly. But into this\r\nwe are not called upon to enter. The Statutes made by the University\r\nCommission of 1850 made fewer changes in the condition of Balliol\r\nthan of most Colleges, because the most inevitable reforms had been\r\ncarried into effect already. The Close Fellowships were opened, and the\r\nmajority of the Fellowships were released from clerical obligations.\r\nThe moment which witnessed the promulgation of the new Statutes\r\nwitnessed also the death of Dean Jenkyns and the succession of Robert\r\nScott. But here we may well conclude the story of the Balliol of the\r\npast. To carry it down further would require much more space than the\r\nlimits of this chapter permit; and besides, the Balliol of the present\r\nis a new College in a different sense from perhaps any other College\r\nin Oxford. No other College has so distinctly parted company with its\r\ntraditions beyond the lifetime of men now living. The commemoration\r\nof founders and benefactors on St. Luke’s Day has long been given up,\r\nand the Latin grace in hall has not been heard for many years. The\r\nCollege buildings are for the greater part the work of the present\r\nreign. In the new hall the portraits which strike the eye behind the\r\nhigh table are all those of men who were alive when the hall was opened\r\nin 1877. Bishop Parsons and Dean Jenkyns are seen above them, while in\r\nthe obscurity of the roof may be discerned the pictures--unhistorical,\r\nas in other Colleges, it need not be said--of John Balliol and\r\nDervorguilla his wife. A visitor from the last century would see little\r\nthat he could recognize; but when he entered the common room after\r\ndinner he would notice one highly conservative custom revived. In 1773\r\nit had been the lament of older men, that\r\n\r\n    “Nec Camerae Communis amor, qua rarus ad alta\r\n    Nunc tubus emittit gratos laquearia fumos;”[122]\r\n\r\nbut in late years the practice of smoking has been regularly admitted\r\neven in those sacred precincts.\r\n\r\nEvery College has its own ideal, and that of Balliol has been by a\r\nsteady policy adapted to the modern spirit of work, employing the best\r\nmaterials not so much for learning as an end in itself as a means\r\ntowards practical success in life. In this field, in the distinctions\r\nof the schools, of the courts, and of public life, it has been seldom\r\nrivalled by any other College. But it is remarkable that in the long\r\nand distinguished list of its men of mark we find, speaking only of the\r\ndead, no Statesman and not many scholars of the first rank. The College\r\nhas excelled rather in its practical men of affairs, diplomatists,\r\njudges, members of parliament, civil service officials, college tutors,\r\nand schoolmasters. At the present moment it counts among former members\r\nno less than seven of her Majesty’s Judges and seven Heads of Oxford\r\nColleges. But to show that another side of culture has been represented\r\nat Balliol in the present reign, we must not forget the band of Balliol\r\npoets, Arthur Hugh Clough, Matthew Arnold, and Algernon Charles\r\nSwinburne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMERTON COLLEGE.[123]\r\n\r\nBY THE HON. GEORGE C. BRODRICK, D.C.L., WARDEN OF MERTON COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1274, “the House of the Scholars of Merton,” since called\r\nMerton College, was solemnly founded, and settled upon its present\r\nsite in Oxford, by Walter de Merton, Chancellor to King Henry III. and\r\nKing Edward I. Ten years earlier, in the midst of the Civil War, this\r\nremarkable man had already established a collegiate brotherhood, under\r\nthe same name, at Malden, in Surrey, but with an educational branch\r\nat Oxford, where twenty students were to be maintained out of the\r\ncorporate revenues. The Statutes of 1264 were very slightly modified in\r\n1270; the Statutes of 1274, issued on the conclusion of the peace, and\r\nsealed by the King himself, were a mature development of the original\r\ndesign, worked out with a statesman-like foresight. These statutes\r\nare justly regarded as the archetype of the College system, not only\r\nin the University of Oxford, but in that of Cambridge, where they\r\nwere adopted as a model by the founder of Peterhouse, the oldest of\r\nCambridge Colleges. In every important sense of the word, Merton, with\r\nits elaborate code of statutes and conventual buildings, its chartered\r\nrights of self-government, and its organized life, was the first of\r\nEnglish Colleges, and the founder of Merton was indirectly the founder\r\nof Collegiate Universities.\r\n\r\nHis idea took root and bore fruit, because it was inspired by a true\r\nsympathy with the needs of the University, where the subjects of study\r\nwere then as frivolous as it was the policy of Rome to make them,\r\nwhere religious houses with the Mendicant Friars almost monopolized\r\nlearning, and where the streets were the scenes of outrageous violence\r\nand license. To combine monastic discipline with secular learning,\r\nand so to create a great seminary for the secular clergy, was the\r\naim of Walter de Merton. The inmates of the College were to live by\r\na common rule under a common head; but they were to take no vows, to\r\njoin no monastic fraternity, on pain of deprivation, and to undertake\r\nno ascetic or ceremonial obligations. Their occupation was to be\r\nstudy, not the _claustralis religio_ of the older religious orders,\r\nnor the more practical and popular self-devotion of the Dominicans and\r\nFranciscans, “the intrusive and anti-national militia of the Papacy.”\r\nThey were all to read Theology, but not until after completing their\r\nfull course in Arts; and they were encouraged to seek employment in\r\nthe great world. As the value of the endowments should increase,\r\nthe number of scholars was to be augmented; and those who might win\r\nan ample fortune (_uberior fortuna_) were enjoined to show their\r\ngratitude by advancing the interests of “the house.” While their\r\nduties and privileges were strictly defined by the statutes, they were\r\nexpressly empowered to amend the statutes themselves in accordance\r\nwith the growing requirements of future ages, and even to migrate from\r\nOxford elsewhere in case of necessity. The Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nas Visitor by virtue of his office, was entrusted with the duty of\r\nenforcing statutable obligations.\r\n\r\nThe Merton Statutes of 1274, as interpreted and supplemented by several\r\nOrdinances and Injunctions of Visitors, remained in force within living\r\nmemory, and the spirit of them never became obsolete. The Ordinances\r\nof Archbishop Kilwarby, issued as early as 1276, with the Founder’s\r\nexpress sanction, chiefly regulate the duties of College officers,\r\nbut are interesting as recognizing the existence of out-College\r\nstudents. Those of Archbishop Peckham, issued in 1284, are directed\r\nto check various abuses already springing up, among which is included\r\nthe encroachment of professional and utilitarian studies into the\r\ncurriculum of the College; the admission of medical students on the\r\nplea that Medicine is a branch of Physics is rigorously prohibited,\r\nand the study of Canon Law is condemned except under strict conditions\r\nand with the Warden’s leave. The Ordinances of Archbishop Chicheley,\r\nissued in 1425, disclose the prevalence of mercenary self-interest\r\nin the College, manifested in the neglect to fill up Fellowships, in\r\nwasteful management of College property, and so forth. The ordinances\r\nof Archbishop Laud, issued in 1640, are specially framed, as might be\r\nexpected, to revive wholesome rules of discipline, entering minutely\r\ninto every detail of College life. Chapel-attendance, the use of\r\nsurplices and hoods, the restriction of intercourse between Masters and\r\nBachelors, the etiquette of meals, the strength of the College ale, the\r\ncustody of the College keys, the costume to be worn by members of the\r\nCollege in the streets, and the careful registration in a note-book\r\nof every Fellow’s departure and return--such were among the numerous\r\npunctilios of College economy which shared the attention of this\r\nindefatigable prelate with the gravest affairs of Church and State.\r\nA century later, in 1733, very similar Injunctions were issued by\r\nArchbishop Potter; and on several other occasions undignified disputes\r\nbetween the Wardens and Fellows called for the decisive interference of\r\nthe Visitor. But the general impression derived from a perusal of the\r\nVisitors’ Injunctions is, that a reasonable and honest construction of\r\nthe Statutes would have rendered their interference unnecessary, and\r\nthat it was a signal proof of the Founder’s sagacity to provide such a\r\nsafeguard against corporate selfishness and intestine discord, in days\r\nwhen public spirit was a rare virtue.\r\n\r\nWhile the University of Oxford has played a greater part in our\r\nnational history than any other corporation except that of the City\r\nof London, the external annals of Merton, as of other Colleges, are\r\ncomparatively meagre and humble. The corporate life of the College,\r\ndating from the Barons’ War, flowed on in an equable course during a\r\ncentury of French Wars, followed by the Wars of the Roses. We know,\r\nindeed, that in early times Merton was sometimes represented by its\r\nWardens and Fellows in camps and ecclesiastical synods, as well as in\r\nCourts, both at home and abroad. For instance, Bradwardine, afterwards\r\nArchbishop, rendered service to Edward III. in negotiations with the\r\nFrench King; Warden Bloxham was employed during the same reign in\r\nmissions to Scotland and Ireland; two successive Wardens, Rudborn and\r\nGylbert, with several Fellows, are said to have followed Henry V. as\r\nchaplains into Normandy, and to have been present at Agincourt; Kemp,\r\na Fellow and future Archbishop, attended the Councils of Basle and\r\nFlorence; and Abendon, Gylbert’s successor in the Wardenship, earned\r\nfame as delegate of the University at the Council of Constance. But the\r\nCollege, as a body, was unmoved either by continental expeditions, or\r\nby the storms which racked English society in the Middle Ages; and its\r\n“Register,” which commences in 1482, is for the most part ominously\r\nsilent on the great political commotions of later periods. During the\r\nreign of Henry VII., indeed, occasional mention of public affairs is\r\nto be found in its pages. Such are the references to extraordinary\r\nfloods, storms, or frosts; to the Sweating Sickness; to the Battle of\r\nBosworth Field; to Perkin Warbeck’s Revolt, and other insurrectionary\r\nmovements of that age; to notable executions; to the birth, marriage,\r\nand death of Prince Arthur; to the death of Pope Alexander VI., and to\r\nLady Margaret’s endowment of a Theological Professorship. After the\r\nreign of Henry VII. the brief entries in this domestic chronicle, like\r\nthe monotonous series of cases in the Law Reports, almost ignore Civil\r\nWar and Revolution, betraying no change of style or conscious spirit of\r\ninnovation; and it is from other sources that we must learn the events\r\nwhich enable us to interpret some passages in the Register itself.\r\n\r\nWhether John Wyclif was actually a Fellow of Merton is still an open\r\nquestion, though no sufficient evidence has been produced to rebut a\r\nbelief certainly held in the next generation after the great Reformer’s\r\ndeath. That his influence was strongly felt at Merton is an undoubted\r\nfact, and the liberal school of thought which he represented had\r\nthere one of its chief strongholds until the Renaissance and the\r\nReformation. Being anti-monastic by its very constitution, and having\r\nbeen a consistent opponent of Papal encroachments, Merton College might\r\nnaturally have been expected to cast in its lot with the Protestant\r\ncause at this great crisis. A deed of submission to Henry VIII. as\r\nSupreme Head of the Church, purporting to represent the unanimous\r\nvoice of the College, and professing absolute allegiance not only to\r\nhim, but to Anne Boleyn and her offspring, is preserved in the Public\r\nRecord Office. This deed bears the signatures of the Sub-Warden and\r\nfifteen known Fellows, besides those of three other persons who were\r\nperhaps Chaplains, but not that of Chamber, the Warden, though his\r\nname is expressly included in the body of the deed. Nevertheless, the\r\nsympathies of the leading Fellows appear to have been mainly Catholic.\r\nWilliam Tresham, an ex-Fellow, zealous as he was in the promotion of\r\nlearning, was among the adversaries of the Reformation movement, and\r\nwas rewarded by Queen Mary with a Canonry of Christ Church. Though he\r\nsigned the acknowledgment of the Royal Supremacy, Richard Smyth was a\r\nstill more active promoter of the Catholic re-action. He also received\r\na Canonry of Christ Church, with the Regius Professorship of Divinity,\r\nand preached a sermon before the stake when Ridley and Latimer were\r\nmartyred, on the unhappy text--“Though I give my body to be burned,\r\nand have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.” Dr. Martiall, another\r\nFellow of Merton, acted as Vice-Chancellor on the same occasion,\r\nand his brother Fellow, Robert Ward, appears on the list of Doctors\r\nappointed to sit in judgment on the doctrines of the Protestant\r\nbishops. Parkhurst, afterwards Bishop of Norwich, is the only Fellow of\r\nMerton recorded by Anthony Wood to have sought refuge beyond the seas\r\nduring the Marian persecution. On the other hand, four only, including\r\nTresham, are mentioned as having suffered the penalty of expulsion\r\nfor refusing the Oath of Supremacy under Elizabeth, though Smyth was\r\nimprisoned in Archbishop Parker’s house, and Raynolds, the Warden, on\r\nrefusing that Oath, was deposed by order of a new Commission.\r\n\r\nA more important place was reserved for Merton College in the great\r\nnational drama of the following century. Having been one of the\r\nColleges in which members of the Legislature were lodged during\r\nthe Oxford Parliament of 1625, and upon which the officers of a\r\nParliamentary force were quartered in 1641, it was selected, in July\r\n1643, for the residence of Queen Henrietta Maria, who then joined the\r\nKing at Oxford, and remained there during the autumn and winter. She\r\noccupied the present dining-room and drawing-room of the Warden’s\r\nhouse, with the adjoining bedroom, still known as “the Queen’s Room.”\r\nThe King, who held his Court at Christ Church, often came to visit her\r\nby a private walk opened for the purpose through Corpus and Merton\r\ngardens; and doubtless took part in many pleasant re-unions, of which\r\nhistory is silent, though a graphic picture of them is preserved in the\r\npages of _John Inglesant_.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that Royalist opinions preponderated among the\r\nMerton Fellows, and there is clear evidence that both sides were\r\nstrongly represented in the College. Sir Nathaniel Brent, the Warden,\r\nbeing a Presbyterian, and having openly espoused the Parliamentary\r\ncause, absented himself, and was deposed in favour of the illustrious\r\nHarvey, Charles I.’s own physician, recommended by the King, but duly\r\nelected by the College. Ralph Button, too, a leading Fellow and Tutor,\r\nquitted Oxford, when it became the Royal head-quarters, lest he should\r\nbe expected to bear arms for the King. On the other hand, Peter Turner,\r\none of the most eminent Mertonians of his day, accompanied a troop of\r\nRoyalist horse as far as Stow in the Wold, was there captured, and was\r\ncommitted to Northampton Gaol. A third Fellow, John Greaves, Savilian\r\nProfessor of Astronomy, drew up and procured signatures to a petition\r\nfor Brent’s deposition; and two more, Fowle and Lovejoy, actually\r\nserved under the Royal standard. But we search the College Register\r\nin vain for any formal resolution on the subject of the Civil War. It\r\nis certain that Merton gave up the whole of its plate for the King’s\r\nuse in 1643, and no silver presented at an earlier date is now in the\r\npossession of the College. But it is interesting, if not consolatory,\r\nto know that in the previous reign a large quantity of old plate had\r\nbeen exchanged for new, so that, from an antiquarian point of view, the\r\nsacrifice made to loyalty was not so great as might be imagined. No\r\nCollege order directing the surrender is extant, and two of the Fellows\r\nafterwards mutually accused each other of having thus misappropriated\r\nthe College property.\r\n\r\nOther notices of the great struggle then convulsing the nation are\r\nfew and far between in the minutes of the College Register. It is\r\nremarkable that, so far back as August 1641, the College directed\r\ntwelve muskets and as many pikes to be purchased, _bello ingruente_,\r\nfor the purpose of repelling any roving soldiers who might break in for\r\nthe sake of plunder. Anthony Wood particularly observes, that during\r\nthe Queen’s stay at Merton there were divers marriages, christenings,\r\nand burials in the Chapel, of which all record has been lost, as the\r\nprivate register in which the Chaplain had noted them was stolen\r\nout of his room when Oxford was finally surrendered to Fairfax. The\r\nconfusion that prevailed during the Royalist occupation of Oxford is,\r\nhowever, officially recognized by the College. It is duly chronicled,\r\nfor instance, that on August 1st, 1645, the College meeting was held\r\nin the Library, neither the Hall nor the Warden’s Lodgings being then\r\navailable for the purpose; and several entries attest the pecuniary\r\nstraits to which the College was reduced. At last it is solemnly\r\nrecorded, under the date of October 19th, 1646, that by the Divine\r\ngoodness the war had at last been stayed, and the Warden (Brent) with\r\nmost of the Fellows had returned, but that as there were no Bachelors,\r\nhardly any Scholars, and few Masters, it was decided to elect but one\r\nBursar and one Dean. It is added that, as the Hall still lay _situ et\r\nruinis squalida_, the College meeting was held in the Warden’s Lodgings.\r\n\r\nWhen the scenes were shifted, and a solemn Visitation of the University\r\nwas instituted by “The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament,”\r\nMerton College may be said to have set the example of conformity to\r\nthe new order in Church and State. Sir Nathaniel Brent himself was\r\nPresident of the Commission. Among his colleagues were three Fellows of\r\nMerton, Reynolds, Cheynell, and Corbet, who had already been appointed\r\nwith four other preachers to convert the gownsmen through Presbyterian\r\nsermons. The earlier sittings of the Commission were held in the\r\nWarden’s dining-room, or, during his absence, in Cheynell’s apartments.\r\nWhen the members of the College, including servants, were called before\r\nthe Visitors and required to make their submission, about half of them,\r\naccording to Anthony Wood, openly complied: most of the others made\r\nanswers more or less evasive, declaring their readiness to obey the\r\nWarden, or submitting in so far as the Visitors had authority from the\r\nKing. French, who, as official guardian of the University Register, had\r\nrefused to give it up, now made his submission, but justified it on\r\nthe strange ground that he was bound by the capitulation of Oxford to\r\nFairfax. One Fellow only, Nicholas Howson, boldly refused submission,\r\ndeclaring that he could not reconcile it with his allegiance to the\r\nKing, the University, and the College. He was of course removed; and\r\nthe same fate befell Turner, Greaves, French, and one other Fellow,\r\nwith a larger number of Postmasters, of whom, however, some were\r\ncondemned as improperly elected, and some were afterwards restored\r\nthrough Brent’s influence. Even while the Commission was sitting, a\r\nRoyalist spirit must have lingered in the College, since we read that\r\nfour of the Fellows, three of whom had submitted, were put out of\r\ncommons for a week and publicly admonished by the Warden for drinking\r\nthe King’s health with a _tertiavit_, and uncovered heads. Brent\r\nresigned the Wardenship in 1651; whereupon the Parliamentary Visitors\r\nproceeded to appoint, by their own authority, but on the express\r\nnomination of the Protector, Dr. Jonathan Goddard, who had been head\r\nphysician to Cromwell’s army in Ireland and Scotland--thereby improving\r\non Charles I.’s paternal but constitutional recommendation of Harvey.\r\n\r\nWith the suspension of this great Visitation, shortly to be followed by\r\nthe Restoration of Charles II., the short-lived connection of Merton\r\nCollege with general history may be said to have closed. It had the\r\nhonour of lodging the Queen and favourite ladies of Charles II. in\r\nthe plague-year, 1665; it cashiered a Probationer-Fellow in 1681 for\r\nmaintaining that Charles I. died justly; it took part in the enlistment\r\nof volunteers for the suppression of Monmouth’s rebellion; and it\r\njoined other Colleges in the half-hearted reception of William III.\r\nBut its records are devoid of political interest, except so far as it\r\nbecame a chief stronghold of Whig principles in the University during\r\nthe Jacobite re-action which followed the Revolution, was encouraged by\r\nthe avowed Toryism of Queen Anne, and almost broke out into civil war\r\non the accession of George I. Charles Wesley expressly mentions it with\r\nChrist Church, Exeter, and Wadham, as an anti-Jacobite society; and\r\nMeadowcourt, a leading member of the College, was the hero of a famous\r\nscene at the Whig “Constitution Club,” when the Proctor, breaking\r\nin, was reluctantly obliged to drink King George’s health. Shortly\r\nafterwards the following entry appeared in the University “Black\r\nBook”:--“Let Mr. Meadowcourt, of Merton College, be kept back from the\r\ndegree for which he next stands, for the space of two years; nor be\r\nadmitted to supplicate for his grace, until he confesses his manifold\r\ncrimes, and asks pardon on his knees”--a penalty, however, which he\r\nmanaged to evade, being afterwards thanked for his loyalty by the Whig\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of contemporary letters or biographies, it is only from\r\ncasual notices in Visitors’ Injunctions, Bursars’ Rolls, and (after\r\n1482) the College Register, that we can obtain any light on the life\r\nand manners of Merton scholars, whether senior or junior, before the\r\nReformation-period. That it was a haven of rest for quiet students,\r\nand a model of academical discipline to extra-collegiate inmates of\r\nhalls and lodgings, during the incessant tumults of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, admits of no doubt whatever. A notable proof of this is the\r\nspecial exemption of Merton “_et aularum consimilium_”--probably\r\nUniversity, Balliol, Exeter, Oriel, and Queen’s Colleges--from the\r\ngeneral rustication of students which followed the sanguinary riot on\r\nSt. Scholastica’s day in 1354. But the rules laid down by the Founder,\r\nand enforced by successive Visitors, were expressly directed to secure\r\ngood order in the Society. By the Statutes of 1274, summary expulsion\r\nwas to be the penalty of persistence in quarrelsome or disorderly\r\nbehaviour. By the Ordinances of Archbishop Peckham and several other\r\nVisitors, the inmates of the College are strictly prohibited from\r\ntaking meals in the town or entering it alone, and enjoined always to\r\nwalk about in a body, returning before nightfall. Other Regulations,\r\nof great antiquity, but of somewhat uncertain date, emphatically\r\nwarn the Fellows against aiding and abetting, even in jest, the\r\nsquabbles between the Northern and Southern “Nations,” or between\r\nrival “Faculties.” In 1508, the College itself legislated directly\r\nagainst the growing practice of giving out-College parties in the city\r\nand coming in late, “even after ten o’clock.” By the Injunctions of\r\nArchbishop Laud, it was ordered that the College gates should be closed\r\nat half-past nine and the keys given to the Warden, none being allowed\r\nto sleep in Oxford outside the College walls, or even to breakfast\r\nor dine, except in the College Hall, carefully separated according\r\nto their degrees. Whether the scholars of Merton, old and young,\r\noriginally slept in large dormitories, or were grouped together by\r\nthrees and fours in sets of rooms, like those occupied singly by modern\r\nstudents, is a question which cannot be determined with certainty. The\r\nstructure of “Mob Quadrangle,” however, together with the earliest\r\nnotices in the Register, justifies the belief that most of them lived\r\nin College rooms, and that in those days the College Library, far\r\nlarger than could be required for the custody of a few hundred or\r\nthousand manuscripts, was the one common study of the whole College,\r\nperhaps serving also as a covered ambulatory. This building is known to\r\nhave been constructed, or converted to its present use, about 1376; but\r\nthe dormer windows in the roof were not thrown out until more than a\r\ncentury later; and in the meantime readers can scarcely have deciphered\r\nmanuscripts on winter-days, in so dark a chamber, without the aid of\r\noil lamps. Fires were probably unknown, except in the Hall, whither\r\ninmates of the College doubtless resorted to warm themselves at all\r\nhours of the day. It is to be hoped that, at such casual gatherings,\r\nthey were relieved from the obligation to converse in Latin imposed\r\nupon them during the regular meals in Hall. But intimacy between\r\njuniors and seniors was strictly prohibited; and though Archbishop\r\nCranmer allowed the College to dispense with the practice of Bachelors\r\n“capping” Masters in the Quadrangle, it was thought necessary to revive\r\nit. As for manly pastimes, which occupy so large a space in modern\r\nUniversity life, they are scarcely to be traced in the domestic\r\nhistory of Merton, though a ball-court is known to have existed at the\r\nwest-end of the Chapel. Football, cudgel-play, and other rough games,\r\nwere certainly played by the citizens in the open fields on the north\r\nof Oxford; but if Merton men took part in them, it was against the\r\nspirit of Merton rules, since these playful encounters were a fertile\r\nsource of town and gown rows. There seem to have been no academical\r\nsports whatever; rowing was never practised, cricket was not invented,\r\narchery was cultivated rather as a piece of warlike training; and it\r\nis to be feared that poaching in the great woods then skirting Oxford\r\non the north-east was among the more favourite amusements of athletic\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that, by the original foundation,\r\nall the members of the College were both Scholars and Fellows, of equal\r\ndignity, except in standing, the Scholar being nothing but a junior\r\nFellow, and the Fellow nothing but an elder Scholar. There were a few\r\nboys of the Founder’s kin, for whom a separate provision was made; and\r\n“commoners” were admitted from time to time at the discretion of the\r\nCollege, but these were mere supernumeraries, at first of low degree,\r\nafterwards of higher rank, and on the footing of fellow-commoners. It\r\nwas not until the new order of Postmasters (_portionistae_) was founded\r\nby Wylliott, about 1380, that a second class of students was recognized\r\nby the College; and this institution of College “scholarships,” in\r\nthe modern sense, long remained a characteristic feature of Merton.\r\nUnlike the young “Scholares,” the Postmasters did not rise by seniority\r\nto what are now called Fellowships, and were, in fact, the humble\r\nfriends of the Master-Fellows who had nominated them. It would appear\r\nthat at the end of the fifteenth century, if not from the first, each\r\nMaster-Fellow had this right; and the number of Postmasters was always\r\nto be the same as that of the Master-Fellows. Until that period they\r\nseem to have been lodged in the separate building, opposite the College\r\ngate, long known as “Postmasters’ Hall.” It is not clear whether they\r\ntook meals in the College Hall, or lived on rations served out to them;\r\nbut it is perfectly clear that they fared badly enough until their\r\ndiet was improved in the reign of James I. by special benefactions of\r\nThomas Jessop and others. In the previous reign, they had been removed\r\ninto the College itself; and thenceforward for several generations they\r\nslept, probably on truckle-beds, in the bedrooms of their respective\r\n“Masters.” Indeed, a College-order of 1543 leads us to suppose that\r\nsome of them were expected to wait upon the Bachelor-Fellows in Hall.\r\n\r\nAnother institution characteristic of Merton in the olden times is one\r\nnow obsolete, but formerly known as the “Scrutiny.” The Founder had\r\nexpressly ordained in his statutes that a “Chapter or Scrutiny” should\r\nbe held in the College itself thrice a year--a week before Christmas,\r\na week before Easter, and on July 20; and that on these occasions a\r\ndiligent enquiry should be made into the life, behaviour, morals, and\r\nprogress in learning of all his scholars, as well as into all matters\r\nneeding correction or improvement. He also decreed that, once a year,\r\nthe Warden, bailiffs of manors, and all others concerned in the\r\nmanagement of College property, should render a solemn account of their\r\nstewardship before the Vice-Warden and all the Scholars, assembled at\r\n“one of the manors.” The bailiffs and other agents of the College were\r\nto resign their keys, without reserve, into the hands of the Warden;\r\nbut the Warden himself was to undergo a like inquisition into his own\r\nconduct, and was apparently to be visited with censure or penalties, in\r\ncase of delinquency, by the College meeting. It is by no means easy to\r\nunderstand why this annual audit, for such it was, should not have been\r\nappointed to be held at one of the stated “Chapters or Scrutinies,”\r\nor why “one of the manors” should have been designated as the lawful\r\nplace for it. At all events, the distinction between a Scrutiny and\r\nan Audit-meeting seems to have been lost at a very early period.\r\nScrutinies, or Chapters, were held frequently, though at irregular\r\nintervals; but at least once a year the Scrutiny assumed the form of\r\nan Audit, not only into accounts, but into conduct, being sometimes\r\nheld in the College Hall, and sometimes at Holywell Manor. The earliest\r\nnotice of such a Scrutiny in the College Register is under the date\r\n1483, when three questions were propounded for discussion:--(1) the\r\nconduct of College servants; (2) the number of Postmasters; and (3)\r\nthe appointment of College officers. Two years later, however, we\r\nfind three other questions laid down as the proper subjects for\r\nconsideration:--(1) the residence and conduct of the Warden; (2) the\r\ncondition of the manors; and (3) the expediency of increasing the\r\nnumber of Fellows. At a later period, the regular questions were--(1)\r\nthe expediency of increasing the number of Postmasters; (2) the\r\nconduct of College servants (as before); and (3) the appointment of a\r\nsingle College officer, the garden-master. Practically, the Scrutiny\r\noften resolved itself into a sort of caucus, at which a free and\r\neasy altercation took place among the Fellows upon all the points of\r\ndifference likely to arise in a cloistered society absorbed in its own\r\npetty interests. In Professor Rogers’ interesting record of a Scrutiny\r\nheld in 1338-9, long before the College Register commences, every\r\nkind of grievance is brought forward, from the Warden’s neglect of\r\nduty to the slovenly attire of the Chaplain, the excessive charge for\r\nhorses, and the incessant squabbles between three quarrelsome Fellows.\r\nThe same freedom of complaint shows itself in the briefer notices\r\nof later Scrutinies to be found in the Register. Undue indulgence\r\nin games of ball, loitering about the town, the introduction of\r\nFellow-commoners into Hall, the prevalence of noise in the bed-chambers\r\nat night, as well as enmities among the Fellows, and abuses in the\r\nestate-management, were among the stock topics of discussion at\r\nScrutinies; and in 1585 complaints were made at a Scrutiny against\r\nsuspected Papists. It is evident that reflections were often cast upon\r\nthe Warden; but it was known that he could only be deposed by the\r\nVisitor after three admonitions from the Sub-Warden; and, though in one\r\ncase these admonitions were given, the Visitor, Archbishop Sancroft,\r\ndeclined to adopt the extreme course. The practice of reviewing the\r\nconduct of the Warden at Scrutinies appears, indeed, to have been\r\nfinally dropped under Warden Chamber, who, as Court physician to King\r\nHenry VIII., had a good excuse for constantly absenting himself; but\r\nthe practice of inviting personal charges against Fellows survived much\r\nlonger, and Scrutinies were nominally held in the last century.\r\n\r\nA third institution distinctive of Merton was the system of\r\n“Variations,” or College disputations, of the same nature as the\r\nexercises required for University degrees. This custom is thus\r\ndescribed by John Poynter, in a little work on the curiosities of\r\nOxford, published in 1749. “The Master-Fellows,” he says, “are obliged\r\nby their Statutes to take their turns every year about the Act time, or\r\nat least before the first day of August, to vary, as they call it, that\r\nis, to perform some public exercise in the Common Hall, the Variator\r\nopposing Aristotle in three Latin speeches, upon three questions\r\nin Philosophy, or rather Morality; the three Deans in their turns\r\nanswering the Variator in three speeches in opposition to his, and in\r\ndefence of his Aristotle, and after every speech disputing with him\r\nsyllogistically upon the same. Which Declamations or Disputations were\r\namicably concluded with a magnificent and expensive supper, the charges\r\nof which formerly came to £100, but of late years much retrenched.”\r\nHe adds that the audience was composed of the Vice-Chancellor and\r\nProctors, with several Heads of Houses, besides the Warden and all the\r\nmembers of the College. As Variations were still in force when Poynter\r\nwrote, we may accept his description of them as tolerably accurate;\r\nbut he is evidently wrong in supposing them to have taken place at\r\none season of the year only, for the College Register clearly proves\r\nthe actual date of them to have been moveable, so long as they were\r\nperformed within the two years of “Regency” following Inception. By the\r\nold rule of the University, all Regent-Masters were obliged to give\r\n“ordinary” lectures during that period. This obligation was enforced at\r\nMerton by the oath required of Bachelor-Fellows before their Inception;\r\nand by the same oath they bound themselves during the same period,\r\nnot only to engage in the logical and philosophical disputations\r\nof the College, but also to “vary twice.” The system was regularly\r\nestablished, and is mentioned as of immemorial antiquity, before\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century. From that time forward Variations\r\nare frequently and fully recorded in the Register; and, whenever\r\ndispensations were allowed, the fact is duly noted. In 1673 a Fellow\r\nwas fined £12--a large sum in those days--for neglecting his second\r\nVariations; and the significant comment is appended:--“we acquitted\r\nhim, so far as we could, of his perjury.” Even the subjects chosen\r\nby the Variators are carefully specified, and astonish us by their\r\nwide range of interest. At first, metaphysical and logical questions\r\npredominate; but there is a large admixture of ethical questions, and\r\na few bearing on natural philosophy. At the end of the sixteenth and\r\nthroughout the seventeenth century, politics enter largely into the\r\nfield of disputation; while in the eighteenth century a more discursive\r\nand literary tone of thought makes itself clearly felt. Upon the\r\nwhole, we can well believe that, in the age before examinations, these\r\nintellectual trials of strength played no mean part in education,\r\nquickening the wits of Merton Fellows, if they did not encourage the\r\ncultivation of solid knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped, no doubt, that they were preceded and supplemented\r\nby sound private tuition; but upon this, unhappily, the Merton records\r\nthrow no light. It seems to be assumed in the original Statutes that\r\nScholars of Merton, though bound to study within the House, will\r\nreceive their instruction outside it. The only exception was the\r\nstatutable institution of a grammar-master, who was to have charge of\r\nthe students in grammar, and to whom “the more advanced might have\r\nrecourse without a blush, when doubts should arise in their faculty.”\r\nThis institution was treated by Archbishop Peckham as of primary\r\nimportance; and he specially censures the College for practically\r\nexcluding boys who had still to learn the rudiments of grammar. There\r\nis good reason to believe that John of Cornwall, who is mentioned as\r\nthe first to introduce the study of English in schools, and to abandon\r\nthe practice of construing Latin into French, actually held the office\r\nof grammar-master in Merton College. These Merton grammar-masters (who\r\ncontinued to be appointed in the sixteenth century) were probably the\r\nearliest type of College tutors--an order which inevitably developed\r\nitself at a later period, but of which the history remains to be\r\nevolved from very scanty materials. The medical lectures founded by\r\nLinacre, and the Divinity lectures founded by Bickley, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as well as the lectures delivered by Thomas Bodley on Greek,\r\nwere essentially College lectures, but seem to have been professorial\r\nrather than tutorial. A College order of June 9th, 1586, the first year\r\nof Savile’s wardenship, requires the Regent-Masters to deliver twenty\r\npublic lectures to the Postmasters on the Sphere or on Arithmetic, as\r\nthe Warden should think fit. Probably this rule was soon neglected; and\r\nit is not until a much later period that we find the modern relation of\r\ntutor and pupil a living reality in Colleges.\r\n\r\nWe may pass lightly over some other strange, though not unique,\r\ncustoms of Merton which fill a large space in the Register and the\r\npages of Anthony Wood. One of these was the annual election of a _Rex\r\nFabarum_, or “Christmas King,” on the vigil of St. Edmund (Nov. 19th),\r\nunder the authority of sealed letters, which “pretended to have been\r\nbrought from some place beyond sea.” This absurd farce, reminding us\r\nof the rough burlesques formerly practised on board ship in crossing\r\nthe Equator, was solemnly enacted year after year, and recorded in\r\nthe Register with as much gravity as the succession of a Warden. The\r\nperson chosen was the senior Fellow who had not yet borne the office;\r\nand, according to Wood, his duty was “to punish all misdemeanours\r\ndone in the time of Christmas, either by imposing exercises on the\r\njuniors, or putting into the stocks at the end of the Hall any of the\r\nservants, with other punishments that were sometimes very ridiculous.”\r\nThis went on until Candlemas (Feb. 2nd), “or much about the time that\r\nthe _Ignis Regentium_ was celebrated.” The _Ignis Regentium_ seems\r\nto have been nothing more than a great College wine-party round the\r\nHall fire, attended with various traditional festivities, and provided\r\nat the cost of all the Regent-Masters, or only of the Senior Regent,\r\nwhose munificent hospitality is sometimes expressly commended. Of a\r\nsimilar nature were the practical jokes and rude horse-play described\r\nby Anthony Wood as carried on, by way of initiating freshmen, on All\r\nSaints Eve and other Eves and Saints’ Days up to Christmas, as well as\r\non Shrove Tuesday, when the poor novices were compelled to declaim in\r\nundress from a form placed on the High Table, and rewarded, or punished\r\nwith some brutality, for their performances. It is significant that,\r\nunder the Commonwealth, these old-world jovialities were disused, and\r\nsoon afterwards died out. The old custom of singing Catholic hymns in\r\nthe College Hall, on the Eves and Vigils of Saints’ Days between All\r\nSaints and Candlemas Day, had been modified at the Reformation by the\r\nsubstitution of Sternhold and Hopkins’ Psalms, which continued to be\r\nsung in Anthony Wood’s times. Not less curious, and more important,\r\nare the detailed regulations made for the health of the College during\r\nfrequent outbreaks of the plague, when the majority of Fellows and\r\nstudents migrated to Cuxham, Stow Wood, Islip, Eynsham, or elsewhere,\r\nand communication between the College and the town was strictly limited.\r\n\r\nWere it possible for a Merton Fellow of the Plantagenet, Tudor, or\r\nStuart period to revisit his College in our own day, he would find but\r\nfew survivals of the quaint usages once peculiar to it. The recitation\r\nof a thanksgiving prayer for benefits inherited from the Founder at\r\nthe end of each chapel-service, the time-honoured practice of striking\r\nthe Hall table with a wooden trencher as a signal for grace, and the\r\nceremonies observed on the induction of a new Warden, are perhaps the\r\nonly outward and visible relics of its ancient customary which the\r\nspirit of innovation has left alive. But he would feel himself at\r\nhome in the noble choir of the Chapel, with its stonework and painted\r\nglass almost untouched by the lapse of six centuries; in the Library,\r\nretaining every structural feature of Bishop Rede’s original work down\r\nto its minutest detail; in the Treasury, with its massive high-pitched\r\nroof, under which the College archives have been preserved entire\r\nsince the reign of Edward I., together with a coeval inventory of the\r\ndocuments then deposited there; in the College Garden, surrounded on\r\ntwo sides by the town-wall of Henry III., extended eastward since the\r\nclose of the Middle Ages by purchases from the City, but curtailed\r\nwestward by sales of land for the site of Corpus. Perhaps, on reviewing\r\nthe unbroken continuity of College history through more than twenty\r\ngenerations, crowded with vicissitudes in Church and State, with\r\ntransformations of ancient institutions, and with revolutions in human\r\nthought, he would cease to repine over changes which the Founder\r\nhimself foresaw as inevitable, and would rather marvel at the vitality\r\nof a collegiate society, which can still maintain its corporate\r\nidentity, with so much of its original structure, in an age beyond that\r\nwhich mediæval seers had assigned for the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nEXETER COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. CHARLES W. BOASE, M.A., FELLOW OF EXETER COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1314 Walter de Stapeldon, Bishop of Exeter, founded Stapeldon Hall,\r\nsoon better known as Exeter College, for “Scholars” (_i. e._ Fellows),\r\nborn or resident in Devon and Cornwall, eight from the former and four\r\nfrom the latter county; and he also founded a grammar-school at Exeter,\r\nto prepare boys for Oxford. He had, at first, bought ground in and\r\nnear Hart Hall (now Hertford College); but this site not proving large\r\nenough, he removed the students to St. Stephen’s Hall in St. Mildred’s\r\nparish, and gave them Hart Hall, that by its rent their rooms might be\r\nkept in repair and be rent-free.\r\n\r\nThe object of the early founders of Colleges was to pass as many men\r\nas possible through a course of training that would fit them for the\r\nservice of Church or State: and so Stapeldon fixed fourteen years\r\nas the outside period of holding his scholarships; he had no idea\r\nof giving fellowships for life. The twelve scholars were to study\r\nPhilosophy; and a thirteenth scholar was to be a priest studying\r\nScripture or Canon Law. Aptness to learn, good character, and poverty\r\nwere the qualifications required of them; and they were to be chosen\r\nwithout regard to favour, fear, relationship, or love. They were kept\r\nin order by punishments, increasing from a stoppage of commons to\r\nexpulsion, at the discretion of the Rector, who was chosen annually\r\nafter the audit in October. The Rector also looked after the money,\r\nand rooms, and servants; but, if two Fellows demanded the expulsion of\r\na servant he was to appoint another. The Rector must have been always\r\nunder thirty; it was the younger Masters of Arts that then directed\r\neducation in the University. Disputations were held twice a week, and\r\nof three disputations, two were in Logic, one in Natural Science.\r\nTenpence a week was allowed for commons, and each scholar received in\r\naddition the sum of ten shillings a year, the Rector and the Priest\r\ntwenty shillings each. If any scholar was away for more than four weeks\r\nhis commons were stopped; and by an absence of five months he forfeited\r\nhis scholarship.\r\n\r\nStapeldon endowed his Hall with the great tithes of Gwinear in\r\nCornwall, and of Long Wittenham in Berks; and any surplus or legacy was\r\nto go to public purposes, such as increasing the number of scholars\r\nor buying books. There was a common chest with three keys, kept by\r\nthe Rector, the senior Scholar, and the Priest; and the audit-rolls\r\n(_computi_) are extant from 1324, though with gaps, as for instance\r\nduring the Black Death (1349). There is something touching in the\r\nnumber of legacies which Stapeldon left to individual poor scholars in\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\nThe scholars were very poor; and to relieve them, Ralph Germeyn\r\n(Precentor of Exeter), Richard Greenfield (Rector of Kilkhampton in\r\nCornwall), and Robert Rygge (Fellow 1362-1372; afterwards Canon and\r\nChancellor of Exeter), at several times founded “chests” for making\r\nloans to them without interest, on security of books or plate; but all\r\nsuch funds have now disappeared, having been, it seems, absorbed in\r\nCharles I’s war-chest. The College itself sometimes borrowed; in 1358\r\nthe College accounts show a payment of “£3 for a Bible redeemed from\r\nChichester chest”; in 1374, of “four marks to our barber for a Bible\r\npledged to him in the time of Dagenet” (John Dagenet had been Rector in\r\n1371-1372).\r\n\r\nThe life was simple. Besides the “commons” (_i. e._ allowances for\r\nfood), “liveries” (_i. e._ clothes) were supplied about once in three\r\nyears. The scholars were to wear black boots (_caligæ_); and conform to\r\nclerical manners according to their standing as Sophists, Bachelors, or\r\nMasters. Meals were taken in the hall (which stood a little north of\r\nthe present hall), where there was always a large bason with hanging\r\ntowels. A charcoal fire burned in the middle of the hall, under an\r\nopening to let out the smoke; but men were not allowed to linger round\r\nthe fire, and they went off to bed early because candles were dear,\r\nnearly 2_d._ a pound, _i. e._ 2_s._ of our money--they lacked therefore\r\nthe genial inspiration of writing by good candle-light. All had to be\r\nin College by nine o’clock in the evening; and the key of the gate was\r\nkept in the Rector’s room, which was over the gate. Lectures began at\r\nsix or seven in the morning; dinner was at ten; supper at five. Of\r\nthe servants, the manciple received five shillings a term, the cook\r\ntwo, barber twelvepence, washerwoman fifteen pence. The barber was the\r\nnewsmonger of that as of other ages.\r\n\r\nThe scholars might by common consent make any new statutes, not\r\ncontrary to the Founder’s ordinances; and were to refer all doubts to\r\nthe Visitor.\r\n\r\nThe Bishops of Exeter were kind Visitors; and gave books and money\r\nseveral times. Gradually more halls and lodging-houses were obtained,\r\nsome lying on the lane[124] which ran all along inside the city wall,\r\nothers along St. Mildred’s (now Brasenose) lane, and others along the\r\nTurl. A tower was built on the site of St. Stephen’s Hall, with a gate\r\nopening into the lane under the city wall; two windows of this tower\r\nsurvive in the staircase of the present Rector’s house. The present\r\ngarden is on the site of some of the old buildings, but the ivy-clad\r\nbuttresses of the Bodleian and the great fig-trees along the College\r\nbuildings, which make such a show in summer, of course do not date from\r\nsuch early times.\r\n\r\nAn agreement had to be made with the Rector of St. Mildred’s parish,\r\nwho feared lest the College-chapel should interfere with his rights.\r\nThis early chapel had rooms under it, and a porch. The _computus_\r\nfor building a library in 1383, shows that the building cost £57\r\n13_s._ 5½_d._, the leaded roof costing £13 13_s._ 4_d._; and it was\r\ncompleted between Easter and Michaelmas, before the beginning of the\r\nAcademic year. The timber came from Aldermaston in Berks, the stone\r\nfrom Taynton in Gloucestershire and Whatley near Frome--the latter\r\ncorresponding to our present Bath stone. Carpenters and masons were\r\npaid 6_d._ a day, and the masons had breakfast and dinner (_merenda_\r\nand _prandium_). David, the foreman, had 6_d._ a week for “commons,”\r\nand he held the place of a modern architect.\r\n\r\nThe regard paid to poverty brought forward some distinguished men, such\r\nas Walter Lihert (Fellow 1420-1425), Bishop of Norwich, a miller’s\r\nson from Lanteglos by Fowey in Cornwall. This consideration for poor\r\nscholars did not often fail. Long afterwards John Prideaux (Fellow\r\n1601, Rector 1612-1642) used to say, “If I could have been parish\r\nclerk of Ubber (Ugborough in Devon), I should never have been Bishop\r\nof Worcester.” Benjamin Kennicott was master of a charity school at\r\nTotnes till friends helped him to come to Oxford, where (in 1747) he\r\nobtained a Fellowship in Exeter College, and became a great Hebrew\r\nscholar. William Gifford, the critic, was apprentice to a shoemaker\r\nat Ashburton, where a surgeon helped him to gain a Bible clerkship\r\nat Exeter (1779); when he became a leader in the literary world, he\r\nremembered his own rise in life, and founded an Exhibition at Exeter\r\nfor poor boys from Ashburton school. Thus the Universities had formerly\r\nsomething of the character of popular bodies in which learning and\r\nstudy were recommendations, and the avenues of promotion were not\r\nclosed even to the poorest.\r\n\r\nThe Wiclifite movement largely influenced Exeter College, and a number\r\nof the Fellows suffered in the cause. But, mixed with this, was a\r\nwish to uphold the independence of the University, as against the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury’s power of visitation; and perhaps a feeling\r\nfor the _lay_ government, as against the clergy. A former Fellow,\r\nRobert Tresilian, was among Richard II’s chief supporters; and his\r\nfate is the first legend in _The Mirror for Magistrates_, written by\r\nWilliam Baldwin in 1559. Later on several Fellows were connected with\r\nthe House of Lancaster. Michael de Tregury (Fellow 1422-1427) was in\r\n1431 made Rector of the new University, set up at Caen by the English\r\nduring their rule in France. The physicians of Henry VI. and Margaret\r\nwere both Fellows. But when Margaret was at Coventry in 1459, levying\r\nan army for the War of the Roses, she took “Queen’s gold” from the\r\nCollege, _i. e._ a tenth of an old fine paid the King for ratifying the\r\ngrant of a house.\r\n\r\nThe College was favourably known in the Revival of Learning. William\r\nGrocyn taught Greek in the hall; and Richard Croke and Cornelius\r\nVitelli lodged in rooms in the College. Some of the Fellows too\r\nwere connected with Wolsey; but the College on the whole sided with\r\nthe opposition to Henry VIII’s measures, like their friends in the\r\nWest. John Moreman (Fellow 1510-1522) opposed Catherine’s divorce,\r\nand was imprisoned under Edward VI. The Cornish insurgents in 1549\r\ndemanded that “Dr. Moreman and Dr. Crispin should be safely sent to\r\nthem.” Moreman was also famous as a schoolmaster; and as Vicar of the\r\nCollege living of Menheniot, he taught the Creed, Lord’s Prayer, and\r\nCommandments in English, the people having hitherto used only the old\r\nCornish tongue.\r\n\r\nThe _Valor Ecclesiasticus_ of 1535 states the College revenues at only\r\n£83 2_s._ But Sir William Petre, a statesman trained under Thomas\r\nCromwell, wishing to benefit his old College, gave it some lands\r\nand advowsons which he bought of Queen Elizabeth, and added eight\r\nFellowships for the counties in which his family held or should hold\r\nland. Elizabeth’s Charter of Incorporation is dated 22nd March, 1566.\r\n\r\nNew Statutes were then framed by Petre and the Visitor. The Rectorship\r\nhad already been made perpetual. Petre allowed the Fellows to retire to\r\nthe Vicarage of Kidlington in time of plague, an oft-recurring trouble.\r\nUnder a later ordinance a Fellow was allowed, with Lord Petre’s\r\napproval, to travel abroad for four years to study Medicine or Civil\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\nPetre also gave the College a curious Latin Psalm-book, which had\r\nbeen the family Bible of the Tudors, the most learned royal family in\r\nEurope. It is from it that we know the birthday of Henry VII., 28th\r\nJan. 1457.\r\n\r\nExeter was still in sympathy with the old faith. Ralph Sherwine (Fellow\r\n1568-1575) was hanged by the side of Edmund Campian of St. John’s, in\r\n1581; and several Fellows fled abroad, such as Richard Bristowe, the\r\nchief of the translators who put forth the Douai Bible. Elizabeth\r\nremedied this by getting two loyal men appointed Rectors successively,\r\nThomas Glasier in 1578, and Thomas Holland in 1592--the latter was one\r\nof the translators of the Authorised Version. Under them Exeter became\r\nremarkable for discipline and learning, tinged by Puritan views.\r\n\r\nJohn Prideaux was an equally well-known Rector under Charles I., and\r\ncame into conflict with Laud. There was more intercourse then between\r\nEnglish and foreign Protestant Universities than there is now; and\r\nSixtinus Amama, the Dutch Hebraist, speaks in the most grateful terms\r\nof the kindness he received from Prideaux and the Fellows. Exeter was\r\nnow training men like Sir John Eliot, William Strode, William Noye, and\r\nJohn Maynard. Maynard afterwards gave his old College money to found a\r\nCatechetical and a Hebrew lectureship. In 1612 the members included 134\r\ncommoners, 37 poor scholars, and 12 servitors--the number of the whole\r\nUniversity was 2920. Western friends, the Aclands, Peryams, and others,\r\nnow built a new hall; and John Peryam also built the rooms between the\r\nhall and the library, while George Hakewill, a Fellow, gave money to\r\nbuild a new chapel in 1623.\r\n\r\nAs to the life of the place, Shaftesbury, the famous statesman, who was\r\na member of the College in 1637, gives an amusing account of “coursing”\r\n(now become a sort of free fight) in the schools; of how he stopped the\r\nevil custom of “tucking” freshmen (_i. e._ grating off the skin from\r\nthe lip to the chin); and how he prevented the Fellows “altering the\r\nsize of” (_i. e._ weakening) “the College beer.” Shaftesbury’s future\r\ncolleague in the Cabal, Clifford, was also at Exeter.\r\n\r\nCharles I., in 1636, gave an endowment out of confiscated lands to\r\nfound Fellowships for the Channel Islands at Exeter, Jesus, and\r\nPembroke, that men so trained might devote themselves to work in the\r\nIslands. He made John Prideaux (Rector 1612-1642) and Thomas Winniff\r\n(Fellow 1595-1609), Bishops, the former of Worcester, the latter of\r\nLincoln, when he at last tried to conciliate the gentry, who were\r\nalmost all opposed to Laud’s innovations.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War most of the Fellows took the King’s side, and\r\nArchbishop Usher sojourned in some wooden buildings then known as\r\nPrideaux Buildings, situated behind the old Rector’s house, buildings\r\nnow partly re-erected in the Turl. The College plate was taken by\r\nCharles, although the Fellows had redeemed it by a gift of money; but\r\nthe King’s needs were overwhelming.\r\n\r\nUnder the Commonwealth John Conant became Rector, and increased\r\nthe fame of the College for learning and discipline. “Once[125] a\r\nweek he had a catechetical lecture in the Chapel, in which he went\r\nover Piscator’s _Aphorisms_ and Woollebius’ _Compendium Theologiæ\r\nChristianæ_; and by the way fairly propounded the principal objections\r\nmade by the Papists, Socinians, and others against the orthodox\r\ndoctrine, in terms suited to the understanding and capacity of the\r\nyounger scholars. He took care likewise that the inferior servants of\r\nthe College should be instructed in the principles of the Christian\r\nreligion, and would sometimes catechise them in his own lodgings.\r\nHe looked strictly himself to the keeping up all exercises, and\r\nwould often slip into the hall in the midst of their lectures and\r\ndisputations. He would always oblige both opponents and respondents to\r\ncome well prepared, and to perform their respective parts agreeably\r\nto the strict law of disputation. Here he would often interpose,\r\neither adding new force to the arguments of an opponent, or more\r\nfullness to the answers of the respondent, and supplying where anything\r\nseemed defective, or clearing where anything was obscure in what the\r\nmoderator[126] subjoined. He would often go into the chambers and\r\nstudies of the young scholars, observe what books they were reading,\r\nand reprove them if he found them turning over any modern author, and\r\nsend them to Tully, that great master of Roman eloquence, to learn the\r\ntrue and genuine propriety of that language. His care in the election\r\nof Fellows was very singular. A true love of learning, and a good\r\nshare of it in a person of untainted morals and low circumstances,\r\nwere sure of his patronage and encouragement. He would constantly look\r\nover the observator’s roll and buttery-book himself, and whoever had\r\nbeen absent from chapel prayers or extravagant in his expenses, or\r\notherwise faulty, was sure he must atone for his fault by some such\r\nexercise as the Rector should think fit to set him, for he was no\r\nfriend to pecuniary mulcts, which too often punish the father instead\r\nof the son. The students were many more than could be lodged within\r\nthe walls: they crowded in here from all parts of the nation, and some\r\nfrom beyond the sea. He opposed Cromwell’s plan of giving the College\r\nat Durham the privileges of a University, setting forth the advantages\r\nof large Universities and the dangers which threaten religion and\r\nlearning by multiplying small and petty Academies. He was instrumental\r\nin moving Mr. Selden’s executors to bestow his prodigious collection\r\nof books, more than 8000 volumes, on the University. In his declining\r\nage he could scarce be prevailed upon by his physicians to drink now\r\nand then a little wine. He slept very little, having been an assiduous\r\nand indefatigable student for about threescore years together. Whilst\r\nhis strength would bear it, he often sat up in his study till late at\r\nnight, and thither he returned very early in the morning.”\r\n\r\nThe Restoration put an end alike to learning and to discipline, to\r\nthe grief of a few good men, such as Ken, though the Royalists in\r\ngeneral issued numerous squibs and satires against the Puritans,\r\nwhich still impose on some writers. Anthony Wood, a strong Royalist\r\nand constant resident in Oxford, makes frequent allusion in his\r\ndiaries to the disastrous effects of the Restoration. “Some cavaliers\r\nthat were restored,” he says in one place, “were good scholars, but\r\nthe generality were dunces.” “Before the war,” he says in another\r\nplace, “we had scholars that made a thorough search in scholastic and\r\npolemical divinity, in humane learning, and natural philosophy: but\r\nnow scholars study these things not more than what is just necessary\r\nto carry them through the exercises of their respective Colleges and\r\nthe University. Their aim is not to live as students ought to do, viz.\r\ntemperate, abstemious, and plain and grave in their apparel; but to\r\nlive like gentry, to keep dogs and horses, to turn their studies into\r\nplaces to keep bottles, to swagger in gay apparell and long periwigs.”\r\nThe difference between a Puritan and a Restoration Head of a House is\r\nstrongly set out by the contrast between Conant’s government of Exeter\r\nand that of Joseph Maynard, who was elected on Conant’s ejection for\r\nrefusing submission to the Act of Conformity (1662). Wood says--“Exeter\r\nCollege is now (1665) much debauched by a drunken governor; whereas\r\nbefore in Dr. Conant’s time it was accounted a civil house, it is now\r\nrude and uncivil. The Rector (Maynard) is good-natured, generous, and\r\na good scholar; but he has forgot the way of a College life, and the\r\ndecorum of a scholar. He is given much to bibbing; and when there is\r\na music-meeting in one of the Fellows’ chambers, he will sit there,\r\nsmoke, and drink till he is drunk, and has to be led to his lodgings by\r\nthe junior Fellows.”\r\n\r\nIn 1666 pressure was put upon Maynard to resign, and he did so\r\non advice of the Visitor and his brother, Sir John Maynard. The\r\nresignation was made smooth for him by the understanding that he\r\nshould be appointed Prebendary of Exeter in room of Dr. Arthur Bury,\r\nwho was now elected Rector of Exeter. Dr. Bury wrote a book, famous\r\nin the Deist controversy, called _The Naked Gospel_, which had the\r\ndistinction of being impeached by several Masters of Arts, and formally\r\ncondemned and burnt by order of the Convocation of the University.\r\nAbout the time of its publication, Bury got into trouble with Trelawney\r\nthe Visitor, the same whose name became a watchword in the West (“and\r\nshall Trelawney die”), over questions of discipline and jurisdiction.\r\nThe Visitor expelled Bury and his supporters, July 1690; the decision\r\nwas appealed against in the Court of King’s Bench, and in the House of\r\nLords, but was finally upheld.\r\n\r\nThe evil effects of the Restoration in studies and in morals continued.\r\nLater on, Dean Prideaux can still say, “There is nothing but drinking\r\nand duncery. Exeter is totally spoiled, and so is Christ Church. There\r\nis over against Baliol, a dingy, horrid, scandalous ale-house, fit for\r\nnone but dragooners and tinkers. Here the Baliol men, by perpetual\r\nbubbing, add art to their natural stupidity to make themselves perfect\r\nsots.”\r\n\r\nExeter and Christ Church were both reformed by John Conybeare,[127]\r\na writer famous for his answer to the _Christianity as old as the\r\nCreation_ of Matthew Tindal, also an Exeter man.\r\n\r\nJacobite feeling was strong in Oxford, and at the election of county\r\nmembers in 1755, when the Jacobites guarded the hustings in Broad\r\nStreet, twenty men deep, the Whigs passed through Exeter and succeeded\r\nin voting. The Vice-Chancellor, a strong Jacobite, remarked on “the\r\ninfamous behaviour of one College”; and this led to a war of pamphlets.\r\nChrist Church, Exeter, Merton, and Wadham were the four Whig Colleges.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century the front gate and tower and the\r\nbuildings between this and the Hall were erected by the help of\r\nsuch friends as Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop of Armagh, formerly a\r\nFellow. But in 1709 the library was burnt. The fire began “in the\r\nscrape-trencher’s room. This adjoining to the library, all the inner\r\npart of the library was destroyed, and only one stall of books or\r\nthereabouts secured.” The wind was west, and the smoke must have\r\nreached the nostrils of Hearne as he lay abed at St. Edmund Hall, for\r\n“he was strangely disturbed with apprehensions of fire.” The library\r\nwas rebuilt in 1778, and had many gifts of books and manuscripts, and a\r\nfund for buying more was established by Dr. Hugh Shortridge.\r\n\r\nWhen the time of religious revival came, John Wesley influenced some\r\nmembers of the College, such as Thomas Broughton (Fellow 1733-1741).\r\nDuring the present century other Fellows were noted in the Evangelical\r\nmovement; and in the Tractarian movement the names of William Sewell,\r\nJohn Brande Morris, and John Dobree Dalgairns (better known as Father\r\nDalgairns), were conspicuous.\r\n\r\nNor did the College lack among the fellows and scholars names in\r\nScience, such as Milman and Rigaud; or in Oriental Learning, as\r\nKennicott and Weston; or in Classics and Literature, as Stackhouse and\r\nUpton; or in Law, as Judge Coleridge; or in Theology, as Forshall the\r\neditor of Wiclif’s Bible, and Milman, Bishop of Calcutta, and Jacobson,\r\nBishop of Chester; while among its other members it counted Sir\r\nGardner Wilkinson and Sir Charles Lyell. Of the living men who uphold\r\nthe repute of the College, this is not the place to speak.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Commissioners threw the Fellowships open, and turned eight\r\nof them into scholarships, ten open, ten for the diocese of Exeter,\r\nand two for the Channel Islands. In the same year new buildings were\r\nbegun facing Broad Street, and next year a library, and the year after\r\na chapel and a rectory. Since the chapel absorbed the site of the\r\nformer rector’s house (east of the old chapel), the new house was built\r\non the site of St. Helen’s quadrangle. The liberality of the members\r\nwas conspicuous on the occasion of these buildings. Stained-glass and\r\ncarved oak stalls have been since given to the chapel, and some fine\r\ntapestry, representing the Visit of the Magi, executed by Burne Jones\r\nand William Morris, old members of the College.\r\n\r\nMany changes have been made in old arrangements, but the foundation\r\nof the new scholarships carried out the real spirit of the Founder’s\r\nviews, in passing men rapidly through a University training. It is\r\nhoped that Walter de Stapeldon would, if now living, approve of the\r\ncare for educating scholars which he had so much at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nORIEL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY C. L. SHADWELL, M.A., FELLOW OF ORIEL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam de Brome, the actual, though not the titular, founder of Oriel\r\nCollege, was at the beginning of the fourteenth century a well-endowed\r\necclesiastic, in the service of King Edward the Second. He held\r\nthe living of Hanworth, Middlesex; he was Chancellor of Durham and\r\nArchdeacon of Stow; he held the office of almoner to the King; and\r\nin 1320 he was presented by the King to the Rectory of St. Mary the\r\nVirgin, Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe College of Walter de Merton had then been in existence nearly\r\nhalf a century; and the type which he had created, a self-governing,\r\nindependent society of secular students, well lodged and well endowed,\r\nwas that to which the aims of the struggling foundations of William of\r\nDurham, Devorguilla of Balliol, and Bishop Stapeldon were directed.\r\nThe poor masters established out of William of Durham’s fund, and now\r\nbeginning to be known as the scholars of University Hall, were still\r\nsubject to Statutes issued by the University, and had not yet attained\r\nto an independent position. It was not till 1340 that the scholars of\r\nthe Lady Devorguilla were set free from the authority of extraneous\r\nProcuratores, and allowed to be governed by a Master of their own\r\nchoosing. The office of Rector of Stapeldon Hall was an annual one;\r\nhe was appointed by the scholars from among themselves, or if they\r\ndisagreed, by the Chancellor of the University, and his principal\r\nduties were bursarial. But for the standard set by the completely\r\norganised House of Merton, the development of these infant societies\r\nmight have taken a very different direction.\r\n\r\nAdam de Brome appears to have chosen Merton as his model, and his\r\nfoundation was from the first intended to be styled a College, a title\r\nperhaps till then exclusively enjoyed by Merton.[128]\r\n\r\nBy Letters Patent, dated at Langley, 20th April, 1324, he obtained\r\nthe royal license to purchase a messuage in Oxford or its suburbs,\r\nand therein to establish “quoddam collegium scolarium in diversis\r\nscientiis studentium,” to be styled the College of St. Mary in Oxford,\r\nwith power to acquire lands to the annual value of thirty pounds. In\r\nthe course of the same year he purchased the advowson of the church\r\nof Aberford, in Yorkshire; and, in Oxford, Perilous Hall, in St. Mary\r\nMagdalen parish, and Tackley’s Inn in the High Street; and by his\r\ncharter dated 6th December at Oxford, and confirmed by the King, 20th\r\nDecember, 1324, at Nottingham, he founded his College of scholars\r\n“in sacra theologia & arte dialectica studentium,” appointing John\r\nde Laughton as their Rector, and assigning to them Tackley’s Inn as\r\ntheir residence. This Society, if it ever came into actual existence\r\nat all, lasted only a little more than a twelvemonth; and on the first\r\nof January, 1325-6, its possessions were surrendered by Adam de Brome\r\ninto the King’s hands, as a preliminary to its re-establishment under\r\nthe King’s name. Edward the Second had already shown an interest in\r\nthe maintenance of academical students at the sister University; and\r\nthe scholars whom he supported there were the germ of the institution\r\nafterwards developed by his son under the name of King’s Hall. He also\r\nfounded the Cistercian house at Oxford. He lent himself readily to the\r\nsuggestion of his Almoner; and by his Letters Patent, dated at Norwich,\r\n21st January, 1325-6, he refounded the College, with Adam de Brome\r\nas its head with the title of Provost, restoring the old endowments,\r\nfurther augmented by the grant of the advowson of St. Mary’s. Leave\r\nwas given to appropriate the church to the use of the College on\r\ncondition of maintaining four chaplains for the performance of daily\r\nservice. License was given to take and hold lands in mortmain to the\r\nannual value of sixty pounds. The original statutes are dated on the\r\nsame day as the charter of foundation. By these statutes, nearly all\r\nthe provisions of which are taken verbatim from the Merton statutes of\r\n1274, the College was to consist of a Provost, and ten scholars to be\r\nnominated in the first instance by Adam de Brome, and thereafter to\r\nbe elected by the whole body. The ten first nominated were to study\r\nTheology; those elected in future were to study Arts and Philosophy,\r\nuntil they were allowed to pass to the study of Theology or (to the\r\nnumber of five or six out of ten) of Civil or Canon Law. The Provost\r\nwas to be chosen by the whole body of scholars from among themselves\r\nand presented to the King’s Chancellor for admission. The second\r\nofficer of the College was the Dean, corresponding to the Sub-Warden at\r\nMerton, filling the Provost’s place in his absence, and acting with him\r\nat all times in the College government. Provision was made, similar to\r\nthat at Merton, for the appointment of other subordinate Deans, such\r\nas were established elsewhere and in later foundations; this power has\r\nhowever never been exercised, and the Dean of Oriel, alone of all who\r\nbear that title, is in power and dignity second only to the head of\r\nthe College. The scholars were to be chosen from among Bachelors of\r\nArts, without preference for any locality, place of birth, or kindred.\r\nThree chapters were to be held in the year, at the same times as those\r\nappointed at Merton, Christmas, Easter, and St. Margaret’s day, at\r\nwhich inquiry was to be made into the conduct of the members, and newly\r\nelected scholars were to be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe foundation was now in contemplation of law, complete. The new\r\nSociety was a corporate body, having a license to hold land, and with\r\na common seal.[129] It probably was at first established either in\r\nSt. Mary’s Hall, the Manse or Rectory House of St. Mary’s Church, or\r\nin Tackley’s Inn, a large messuage in the High Street, on the site now\r\noccupied by the house No. 106.\r\n\r\nBut the College had not long been founded before Adam de Brome\r\nperceived that the protection afforded by the King’s name would be\r\ninsufficient, unless he could also obtain the support of the Bishop of\r\nLincoln, Henry de Burghash. The Bishop’s approbation of the foundation\r\nwas not given until a new body of statutes had been drafted, differing\r\nin many important particulars from the Foundation Statutes, and placing\r\nthe College under the control not of the Crown but of the Bishop. The\r\nProvost when elected is to be presented to the Bishop for approval\r\nor confirmation. Only three of the Fellows may be allowed to study\r\nCivil or Canon Law, all the rest being required to betake themselves\r\nto Theology. The Bishop is everywhere substituted for the King or his\r\nChancellor; his approval is required for alterations in the statutes;\r\nthe power of interpreting them on the occasion of any dispute is vested\r\nin him; and he is constituted the sole and final judge in the removal\r\nof a Provost or scholar for misconduct. Prayers are to be said for the\r\nBishop’s father and mother, Robert Lord Burghash and Matilda his wife,\r\nhis brothers Robert and Stephen, as well as for the King and Adam de\r\nBrome; the name of Hugh le Despenser is significantly omitted. These\r\nstatutes were issued by the College 23rd May, and confirmed by the\r\nBishop 11th June, 1326; the Bishop’s charter approving the foundation\r\nwas first given on 13th March, but apparently was kept back until the\r\nconstitution of the College had been settled to his satisfaction,\r\nand was only finally granted on 19th May. In the course of the same\r\nyear the appropriation of the church of St. Mary was approved by the\r\nBishop and the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln; and on Adam de Brome’s\r\nresignation, the College was duly inducted by the Prior of St.\r\nFrideswide (August 10).\r\n\r\nBy the close of the year the Queen’s party, to which Bishop Burghash\r\nbelonged, had triumphed over the Despensers, the deposition of the\r\nKing following in January 1327. The Bishop made use of the favour in\r\nwhich he stood with the new government to obtain some substantial\r\nbenefits for the College which he had taken under his protection. The\r\nadvowson of Coleby, Lincolnshire, purchased by Adam de Brome, was\r\nsecured to the College by a Royal grant, with a view to its ultimate\r\nappropriation. The Hospital of St. Bartholomew, near Oxford, and of\r\nRoyal foundation, was annexed to the College. The maintenance of the\r\nalmsmen was provided by a charge on the fee farm rent of the city; but\r\nthe possessions of the Hospital, consisting principally of tenements\r\nand rents in Oxford, went to augment the slender endowments of the\r\nCollege.[130] But the most important accession which the institution\r\nnow received was by the grant of a messuage, called “La Oriole,” the\r\nnucleus of the site of the present College buildings. This messuage\r\nstood in St. John Baptist’s parish, fronting Schidyard Street and St.\r\nJohn Street, and occupying nearly the whole of the southern half of\r\nthe present quadrangle; the south-east corner, the site of the present\r\nchapel, was not acquired till later. It had anciently been known as\r\nSenescal Hall, but had since acquired the name of La Oriole. Queen\r\nEleanor, wife of Edward the First, had granted it to her chaplain and\r\nkinsman James of Spain, and the reversion was now (Dec. 1327) conferred\r\nupon the College. The life interest was surrendered in 1329, and the\r\nSociety probably removed there in that year.[131]\r\n\r\nThe increase in the College revenues since its first establishment was\r\nprobably the occasion of issuing some further supplementary statutes,\r\n8th December, 1329. The commons or weekly allowance was raised from\r\ntwelve to fifteen pence a week for each scholar. The stipend of the\r\nProvost was increased to ten marks. Ten shillings were allowed to\r\nthe Dean; five shillings apiece to the two Fellows, “collectores\r\nreddituum,” who collected the income derived from the oblations in St.\r\nMary’s Church, and the rents of house and other property in Oxford;\r\nfive shillings to the collector of the Littlemore tithes; pittances\r\nwere allowed to the Fellows at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. The\r\nProvost was allowed to keep a separate table, and to maintain a private\r\nservant. By a more important provision, ex-Fellows were made eligible\r\nto the office of Provost. These statutes were confirmed by the Visitor\r\n26th Feb. 1330, and with those of May 1326, by Royal Letters Patent,\r\n18th March, 1330.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter in the history of the College, recording the birth\r\nand establishment of Adam de Brome’s foundation, closes with the Papal\r\nBulls ratifying and confirming the acts of the King and the Bishop, and\r\nauthorising the appropriation of the three benefices of St. Mary’s,\r\nAberford, and Coleby. These were obtained in answer to a letter of the\r\nKing, dated 4th December, 1330, in which the design of the foundation\r\nis becomingly set forth. In a postscript to this letter the King calls\r\nthe Pope’s attention to another matter, the inconvenience arising\r\nfrom the frequent occurrence of disturbances in St. Mary’s Church and\r\nChurchyard, arising from the gatherings that habitually took place\r\nthere, and which led to “effusiones sanguinis” within the consecrated\r\nprecincts, calling for the Bishop’s sentence of reconciliation.\r\nThis was not always easily to be obtained, the Bishop being engaged\r\nelsewhere in his extensive diocese; and the King suggests that the Pope\r\nshould authorise the Bishop to give a standing commission to the Abbots\r\nof Oseney and Rewley to act for him whenever occasion should require,\r\nand effect the necessary reconciliation. The Pope, having taken six\r\nmonths to consider this application, issued on the 23rd June, 1331,\r\nfour separate Bulls, three of which provided for the appropriation to\r\nthe College of the three churches, and the fourth dealt with the matter\r\nlast referred to, the use of St. Mary’s Church for secular assemblies,\r\nbut very differently from the King’s expectations. Instead of acceding\r\nto the proposal that a simple and expeditious machinery should be\r\nprovided for the reconciliation of the Church, on the not unusual\r\noccurrence of a riot within its walls, he proceeded to forbid, under\r\npenalty of excommunication, the holding of any meetings whatever,\r\n“mercationes aliquas emendo vel vendendo seu conventiculas illicitas,”\r\nin the church or churchyard. The Bulls authorising the appropriations\r\nasked for were promptly put into execution, and the benefices secured\r\nto the College, though Aberford did not fall vacant till 1341,\r\nand Coleby not till 1346. But the fourth Bull was suffered to lie\r\nunemployed in the College custody, until an opportunity[132] arose in\r\nwhich it was thought likely to prove serviceable.\r\n\r\nAdam de Brome died 16th June, 1332, on which day his obit. was long\r\nobserved by the College. By his will, proved in the Mayor of Oxford’s\r\nCourt, certain houses in Oxford--Moses Hall in Penyferthyng Street,\r\nand Bauer Hall in St. Mary Magdalen parish--which he had acquired for\r\nthe further endowment of his College, were devised to Richard Overton,\r\nclerk, his executor. Overton may have been one of the Fellows; at\r\nall events he was intimately associated with Adam de Brome in the\r\nestablishment of the College and in the acquisition of its endowments;\r\nand the property now left to him, and other property afterwards\r\nacquired, were all ultimately secured to Oriel.\r\n\r\nAdam de Brome was succeeded in the Provostship by William de Leverton,\r\nFellow and Master of Arts, unanimously elected by the College, and\r\ninstituted by the Bishop, 27th June. Leverton died 21st Nov. 1348, and\r\nWilliam de Hawkesworth, Doctor in Theology, was elected in his place.\r\nThe Bishop annulled this election on the ground of informality, and\r\nhimself appointed Hawkesworth to be Provost by his own authority.[133]\r\nHawkesworth’s tenure of the Provostship was short, and it is chiefly\r\nmemorable for the part he played in the disputed election to the\r\nChancellorship of the University, which occurred early in 1349.\r\nHawkesworth, who had already acted as the Chancellor’s Commissary, was\r\nthe candidate of the Northerners, the party with which the College\r\nappears throughout to be connected; John Wylliot, Fellow of Merton,\r\nwas the candidate of the Southerners. On the 19th of March 1349,\r\nHawkesworth, as Chancellor, with his Proctors proceeded to St. Mary’s\r\nfor the performance of Divine service, and they were there attacked\r\nby Wylliot and his party. It was then that Hawkesworth had recourse\r\nto the neglected Bull of Pope John XXII., which had hitherto lain\r\nunused in the College Treasury. It was now produced and publicly read\r\nin the Church, with what immediate result does not appear, though\r\nWylliot’s action was complained of to the King, and a Commission sent\r\nto inquire into the matter. Hawkesworth’s death followed soon after,\r\nApril 8th; he was buried in St. Mary’s, where an inscription still\r\nremains to his memory. Before the election of his successor, an order\r\nwas received from the Bishop, prescribing the procedure to be followed,\r\nprobably with the object of preventing the irregularities which had\r\nvitiated the last election. William de Daventre, who was now chosen,\r\nhad been an active member of the College for some years; his name\r\noccurs frequently in deeds relating to the Oxford property. In 1361\r\nthe College found itself rich enough to obtain the King’s license to\r\nadd to its possessions divers messuages and small pieces of ground in\r\nOxford, which had been accumulating since the foundation, and which\r\nwere, up to this time, held in the name of members of the society in\r\ntrust. The earliest roll of College property, the rental for the year\r\n1363-4, was drawn up shortly after the license had been obtained and\r\nacted upon; and as a consequence of this increase in their corporate\r\nrevenues, a new ordinance or statute was issued in 1364, augmenting the\r\nweekly commons, and assigning additional stipends to the Provost, and\r\nto certain College servants.\r\n\r\nDaventre died in June 1373, and was succeeded by John de Colyntre,\r\nthen one of the Fellows, and for some years past one of its leading\r\nmembers. The entry of his election in the Lincoln Register records\r\nthe names of the electing Fellows, eight besides Colyntre himself,\r\nand describes him in eulogistic language, “virum in spiritualibus et\r\ntemporalibus plurimum circumspectum literarum sciencia vita et moribus\r\nmerito commendandum scientem et valentem jura domus nostrae efficaciter\r\nprosequi et tueri quin immo propter vite sue munditiam et excellentiam\r\nvirtutum apud omnes admodum gratiosum.” It was long before the Fellows\r\nwere again as completely in harmony upon the choice of their head.\r\nColyntre’s rule lasted till his death in 1385 or 1386.\r\n\r\nAll through the latter part of the fourteenth century the College\r\nwas engaged in increasing its scanty endowment, by the purchase, as\r\nopportunity offered, of houses, quit-rents, and other property in\r\nOxford, contiguous to or in the neighbourhood of La Oriole. The chantry\r\nof St. Mary in the church of St. Michael Southgate, founded by Thomas\r\nde la Legh, was annexed to the College in 1357; as was also the chantry\r\nof St. Thomas in the church of St. Mary the Virgin in 1392. Other\r\nacquisitions were secured by successive licenses in mortmain, granted\r\nin 1376, in 1392, and in 1394. In this way the greater part of the\r\nground lying between La Oriole and St. Mary’s Hall was acquired and\r\nappropriated to the enlargement of the College buildings and garden.\r\n\r\nThe name of St. Mary’s College, the legal description of the College,\r\nseems to have been little used: the Society is sometimes described\r\nas the King’s Hall, or the King’s College, but it was more generally\r\nknown by the old name of the mansion in which it was lodged. The first\r\ninstance of the use of the name “Oriel” by the College itself in a\r\nformal document is in 1367; but it was no doubt a popular designation\r\nat a much earlier date.\r\n\r\nIn 1373 license was granted by the Bishop for the celebration of masses\r\nand other divine offices in a chapel constructed, or to be constructed,\r\nwithin the College. Previous to this the church of St. Mary had been\r\nresorted to for all purposes. The legends on the painted glass windows\r\nin this chapel, preserved by Wood, record its erection by Richard Earl\r\nof Arundel, and by his son Thomas Arundel, about the year 1379.\r\n\r\nNext in importance for the society of students which Adam de Brome had\r\nfounded, after providing them with a house to lodge in, a church or\r\nchapel to worship in, and means to maintain them, was books for them\r\nto study; and this he had, as he believed, secured in the infancy of\r\nthe foundation, by acquiring the library which Thomas Cobham, Bishop\r\nof Worcester, had brought together, and which he had placed in the\r\nnew building he had erected adjoining St. Mary’s Church. The building\r\nand the books placed in it were intended by the Bishop to be made over\r\nto the University for the use of all its students; but his intention\r\nwas frustrated by his premature death; and his executors, finding\r\nhis estate unequal to the payment of his debts and funeral expenses,\r\nwere driven to pawn the books for the sum of fifty pounds. Adam de\r\nBrome, who, as Rector of the church, had allowed the building to be\r\nerected on his ground, pressed for the completion of the Bishop’s\r\nundertaking; and the executors, unable otherwise to help him, told him\r\nto go in God’s name, and redeem the books and hold them for the use\r\nof his College. Acting upon this permission, he redeemed the books,\r\nbrought them to Oxford, and gave them, with the building which had\r\nbeen built for their reception, to his newly founded Society. This\r\naccount of the transaction was not acquiesced in by the University;\r\nand in the Long Vacation of 1337, five years after Adam de Brome’s\r\ndeath, the Chancellor’s Commissary, at the head of a body of students,\r\nmade forcible entry into the building, and carried off the books, the\r\nfew Fellows who were then in residence not daring, as the College\r\nplaintively records, to offer any resistance. Thirty years later,\r\nproceedings were taken in the Chancellor’s Court to recover possession\r\nof the building itself; and notwithstanding an urgent petition of the\r\nCollege imploring the Bishop of Lincoln to interfere on its behalf,\r\nthe University took possession, and established, in the upper story\r\nof what is still known as the Old Congregation House, the nucleus of\r\nits first library. The College continued for a long time to assert\r\nits claim; and it was not till 1410 that the dispute was finally set\r\nat rest. But although disappointed in this quarter, other donors and\r\nbenefactors rapidly came forward to compensate the College for its\r\nloss. Adam de Brome probably gave largely. Master Thomas Cobildik\r\nappears in the earliest catalogue as the donor of a considerable part\r\nof the then recorded collection. William Rede, Bishop of Chichester,\r\nwho died in 1385, left ten books to Oriel, and made a similar bequest\r\nto most of the then existing Colleges. Provost Daventre, who died in\r\n1373, left the residue of his books to the College. Two Fellows, Elias\r\nde Trykyngham and John de Ingolnieles, whose names occur together in\r\na deed of 1356, gave books which are still in the College library.\r\nIn 1375 a catalogue was compiled, which is still preserved;[134]\r\nthis comprises about one hundred volumes, arranged according to the\r\ndivisions of academical study, the Arts, the Philosophies, and lastly,\r\nthe higher departments of Law--Civil and Canon--and Theology.\r\n\r\nThe Society for whose use it was intended was still a small one; the\r\nnumber of Fellows remained, as Adam de Brome had left it, at no more\r\nthan ten. The average tenure of a Fellowship was about ten years. The\r\nrequirement to proceed to the higher faculties produced little result;\r\neither it was disregarded, or the Fellowship was vacated from other\r\ncauses before the time came for obeying it. By the statutes a vacancy\r\nwas caused by entering religion, obtaining a valuable benefice, or\r\nceasing to reside and study in the College. Marriage must always have\r\nbeen reckoned as a variety of the last disqualification; and it is\r\nespecially enumerated in a deed of 1395 reciting the various causes\r\nwhich might bring about the avoidance of a Fellowship.\r\n\r\nThe Provost, on the other hand, generally held his office till his\r\ndeath. This is the case during the whole of the first century of the\r\nCollege (1326-1425).\r\n\r\nBesides the members of the corporate society, room appears to have\r\nbeen found in the Oriole for a few other members, graduates, scholars,\r\nbible-clerks, commensales. Thomas Fitzalan, or Arundel, afterwards\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, is the most eminent name recorded in the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps worth while here to dispose of the claim of the College\r\nto be connected with the authorship of _Piers Ploughman_. The real name\r\nof the author of this remarkable poem was, no doubt, William Langlande;\r\nbut a misunderstanding of a passage in the opening introduction led\r\nStowe hastily to infer that it was written by one John Malverne; and\r\na name something like this, John Malleson, or Malvesonere, occurring\r\nas that of one of the Fellows of Oriel in deeds of the year 1387 and\r\nsubsequently, was sufficient ground for identification. It is enough\r\nnow to say that the poem was not written by any John Malverne, and that\r\nno person of that name was ever Fellow of Oriel; that the only Fellow\r\nwith a name at all resembling it first appears some time after the date\r\nof the poem (_c._ 1362); and that the internal evidence makes it highly\r\nimprobable that the writer was ever at any University. There has been,\r\nhowever, this indirect advantage to the College, that, on the ground\r\nof its supposed connexion, a valuable MS. of the poem was presented\r\nto its library in the seventeenth century, which ranks among the best\r\nauthorities for the text.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Provost Colyntre in 1386 began the first of a long\r\nseries of disputes concerning the election of a head. The Fellows were\r\ndivided in their choice between Dr. John Middleton, Fellow and Canon of\r\nHereford, and Master Thomas Kirkton. Middleton had the support of five,\r\nKirkton of four of the Fellows. An attempt was made, though whether\r\nbefore or after the election does not clearly appear, to deprive Master\r\nRalph Redruth, B.D., of his Fellowship, though on appeal to the King\r\nhe succeeded in retaining his place. Kirkton presented himself to the\r\nBishop of Lincoln, and was confirmed. From the Bishop appeal was made\r\nto the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to the King. On the 18th of April,\r\n1386, Letters Patent were issued, ordering two of the Fellows, John\r\nLandreyn, D.D., and Master Ralph Redruth, to assume the government\r\nof the College, pending the termination of the dispute; and by other\r\nletters of May 23rd, the Archbishop, Robert Rugge, Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, and John Bloxham, Warden of Merton, were commissioned to\r\nhear the parties and give final judgment and sentence. Under this\r\ncommission some sentence may have been given in favour of Kirkton,\r\nthough of this no record has been discovered. At all events the King’s\r\nSergeant-at-arms was ordered, October 26th, to put him in peaceable\r\npossession of the Provostship. This order was again, January 4th,\r\n1386-7, revoked by Letters Patent, reciting that Kirkton had before\r\nArundel, then Chancellor and Bishop of Ely, renounced all his claims.\r\nMeanwhile the Archbishop had proceeded independently and more slowly.\r\nOn the 4th of May he had commissioned Master John Barnet, official of\r\nthe Court of Canterbury, and Master John Baketon, Dean of Arches, to\r\nhear Middleton’s appeal; and a like commission to Barnet alone was\r\nissued on the 21st of November. Under the last commission sentence was\r\ngiven in favour of Middleton, and an order was sent, 26th February,\r\n1386-7, to the Chancellor of Oxford, and to John Landreyn for his due\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\nMiddleton died at Hereford, 27th June, 1394, and was succeeded by John\r\nMaldon, M.A., B.M., and Scholar in Divinity, “nuper & in ultimis diebus\r\nconsocius et conscolaris juratus.” In the record of the election in the\r\nLincoln Register, the names of twelve other Fellows appear as electors.\r\nThe most important memorial of his period of office now preserved is\r\nthe Register of College muniments, compiled in 1397, perhaps under\r\nthe hand of Thomas Leyntwardyn, Fellow, and afterwards Provost. This\r\nvaluable record consists of a carefully arranged catalogue of all the\r\ndeeds, charters, and muniments of title then in the College possession.\r\nPrefixed to the Register is a Calendar, noting the anniversaries,\r\nobits, and other days to be observed in the College in commemoration\r\nof its founders and benefactors. Maldon died early in 1401-2. By his\r\nwill, dated January 21st, he made various bequests to the College, and\r\nto individual Fellows. One book, at least, belonging to him is still in\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nHitherto the materials for the history of the College have mainly\r\nconsisted of the title-deeds relating to the property from time to\r\ntime acquired, the purchases being in the first instance made in the\r\nnames of a certain number of the Fellows, these again handing it\r\non to some of their successors, until the College felt itself in a\r\nposition to apply for a license in mortmain to enable it to hold the\r\nproperty in its corporate character. In this way it is possible to\r\nmake out a tolerably full list of the early members of the College.\r\nFrom about the time of the compilation of the earliest Register, in\r\n1397, this source of information is no longer very productive. Compared\r\nwith the abundance of deeds of the fourteenth century, which are\r\ncatalogued in the Register of 1397, the fifteenth century is singularly\r\ndeficient. Fortunately, however, the want is supplied by other sources\r\nof information of more interest. The earliest book of treasurer’s\r\naccounts, still preserved, extends from 1409 to 1415. The income of\r\nthe College was made up of the rents of Oxford houses, about £53;\r\nthe tithes of its three churches, Aberford, Coleby, and Littlemore,\r\nbelonging to St. Mary’s, about £35; and the proceeds of offerings in\r\nSt. Mary’s Church, about £28. The net income, after deducting repairs\r\nand other outgoings on property, was between £80 and £90. The principal\r\nitems of expenses were (1) the commons of the Provost and Fellows, at\r\nthe rate of 1_s._ 3_d._ per week per head; (2) battells, the charge for\r\nallowances in meat and drink to other persons employed in and about\r\nthe College, servants, journeymen, labourers, tilers, and the like,\r\nincluding also the entertainment of College visitors, the clergy of St.\r\nMary’s, or the city authorities; (3) exceedings, “excrescentiae,” the\r\ncost incurred on any unusual occasion of College festivity, wine drunk\r\non the feasts of Our Lady, pittances distributed among the members\r\nof the College on certain prescribed days, and similar extraordinary\r\nexpenses. The amounts expended are accurately recorded for each week,\r\nthe week ending, according to the practice which continues at Oriel\r\nto the present day, between dinner and supper on Friday. The total of\r\nthese charges amounted to about £40. The stipends of the Provost and of\r\nthe College officers, the payments to the Vicar of St. Mary’s and the\r\nfour chaplains, the wages of College servants, and the ordinary cost of\r\nthe College fabric, are the principal other items of expenditure.\r\n\r\nIn 1410, the long-standing dispute with the University as to Cobham’s\r\nlibrary was set at rest, through the mediation of Archbishop Arundel.\r\nNot long afterwards a sum of money was raised by contributions from\r\nmembers of the College, and from parishioners of St. Mary’s, for\r\nrenewing the internal fittings of the church, the University giving\r\n£10 _pro choro_. On the completion of the work, the Chancellor and the\r\nwhole congregation of regents and non-regents were regaled with wine,\r\nat a cost of eight shillings, including oysters for the scrutineers.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to discover in the dry pages of the College\r\naccounts, any indication of the domestic quarrels which at this time\r\nviolently divided the Society. The attempts made by the Archbishop,\r\nwith the support of the King, to suppress the Lollard doctrines,\r\naroused considerable opposition in the University. In 1395, Pope\r\nBoniface IX. had issued a Bull, in answer to a petition from the\r\nUniversity, by which the Chancellor was confirmed as the sole authority\r\nover all its members, to the exclusion of all archbishops and\r\nbishops in England. This Bull, though welcome to the majority of the\r\nCongregation, consisting largely of Masters of Arts, was resisted by\r\nthe higher faculties, and especially by the Canonists; and the King, at\r\nthe instance of the Archbishop, compelled the University, by the threat\r\nof withdrawing all its privileges, to renounce the exemption. Another\r\nburning question was the condemnation of the heretical doctrines of\r\nWycliffe. Under considerable pressure from Archbishop Arundel, the\r\nUniversity appointed twelve examiners to search Wycliffe’s writings,\r\nand extract from them all the erroneous conclusions which deserved\r\ncondemnation. This task was performed in 1409; but the recalcitrant\r\nparty among the residents continued to throw considerable difficulty\r\nin the way of the Archbishop’s wishes; and Oriel seems to have been\r\nan active centre of resistance. In 1411, the Archbishop visited the\r\nUniversity, with the double object of asserting his metropolitical\r\nauthority, which had been threatened by the Papal Bull of exemption,\r\nand of crushing out the Lollard heresies. He was not immediately\r\nsuccessful; but he had behind him the support of the King, and by the\r\nend of the year the obnoxious Bull was revoked, and order was restored.\r\nIt was probably after this settlement that an enquiry was held at\r\nOriel into the conduct of some of the Fellows who had taken an active\r\npart in opposition. William Symon, Robert Dykes, and Thomas Wilton,\r\nall Northerners, are charged with being stirrers up and fomenters of\r\ndiscord between the nations; they frequent taverns day and night, they\r\ncome into College at ten, eleven, or twelve at night, and if they find\r\nthe gate locked, climb in over the wall. Wilton wakes up the Provost\r\nfrom his sleep, and challenges him to come out and fight. On St Peter’s\r\nEve, 1411, when the College gate was shut by the Provost’s order, he\r\nwent out with his associates, attacked the Chancellor in his lodgings,\r\nand slew a scholar who was within. One witness deposed to seeing him\r\ncome armed into St. Mary’s Church, and when his sword fell out of his\r\nhand, crying out, “There wyl nothing thryve wyt me.” In support of\r\nthe charge that Oriel College suffered in reputation by reason of the\r\nmisbehaviour of its Fellows, Mr. John Martyll, then Fellow, deposes\r\nthat many burgesses of Oxford and the neighbourhood are minded to\r\nconfiscate the College lands, rents, and tenements. Upon these general\r\ncharges of domestic misconduct, follow others against Symon and against\r\nMaster John Byrche of more public importance. Byrche was Proctor in\r\n1411, and Symon in 1412.[135] Both appear to have taken an active part\r\nin opposing the attempt of the Chancellor and the Archbishop to correct\r\nthe ecclesiastical and doctrinal heresies of the University. Byrche\r\nas Proctor contrived to carry in the Great Congregation a proposal\r\nto suspend the power of the twelve examiners appointed to report on\r\nWycliffe’s heresies; and when the Chancellor met this by dissolving\r\nthe Congregation, Byrche next day summoned a Small Congregation, and\r\nobtained the appointment of judges to pronounce the Chancellor guilty\r\nof perjury, and by this means frightened him into resigning his office.\r\nWhen the Archbishop arrived for his visitation, Byrche and Symon held\r\nSt. Mary’s Church against him, and setting his interdict at naught,\r\nthey opened the doors, rang the bells, and celebrated high mass. When\r\nsummoned in their place in College to renounce the Papal Bull of\r\nExemption, they declined to follow the example of their elders and\r\nbetters, and flatly refused to comply.\r\n\r\nUpon these charges a number of witnesses were examined; some, possibly\r\ntownsmen, giving evidence as to the disturbances in the streets between\r\nthe Northern and Southern nations; others, notably John Possell, the\r\nProvost, Mr. John Martyll, and Mr. Henry Kayll, Fellows, Mr. Nicholas\r\nPont, and Mr. John Walton, speaking to the occurrences in College\r\nand in the Convocation House. It does not seem that any very serious\r\nresults followed from the inquiry; Symon, and a young bachelor Fellow,\r\nRobert Buckland, against whom no specific charge was made, confessed\r\nthemselves in fault; as to the others, nothing more is recorded. A\r\nnumber of further charges were prepared against a still more important\r\nmember of the College, the Dean, John Rote (or Root), who by his\r\nconnivance, and by his refusal to support the Provost’s authority,\r\nmade himself partaker in the misconduct of the younger Fellows, and\r\nwas justly held to be the “root” of all the evil. Such was the weight\r\nof his character in College, that none would venture to go against\r\nhis opinion; his refusing to interfere, his sitting still and saying\r\nnothing when these enormities were reported to the Provost, was a\r\ndirect encouragement to the offenders. At other times, in Hall, and in\r\nthe company of the Fellows, he uttered the rankest Lollardism. “Are\r\nwe to be punished with an interdict on our church for other people’s\r\nmisdoings? Truly it shall be said of the Archbishop, ‘The devil go\r\nwith him and break his neck.’ The Archbishop would better take care\r\nwhat he is about. He tried once before to visit the University, and\r\nwas straightway proscribed the realm. I have heard him say, ‘Do you\r\nthink that Bishop beyond the sea’--meaning the Pope--‘is to give away\r\nmy benefices in England? No, by St. Thomas.’” What was this but the\r\nbattle-cry of the new sect, “Let us break their bonds asunder, and\r\ncast away their cords from us”? But no evidence was offered on these\r\ncharges, and Root remained undisturbed in his College eminence.\r\n\r\nPossell, who is stated to have been sixty years of age at the time\r\nof the commission of enquiry, seems to have died in September 1414;\r\nand the proceedings which followed further illustrate the divided\r\ncondition of the College. A prominent candidate for the Provostship was\r\nRote, already conspicuous for his outspoken Lollardism, and who, by\r\nhis adversaries’ own admissions, was of far more weight and influence\r\nin the College than the old and timid Provost. An election was held,\r\nseemingly in the following October, at which he was chosen; and he\r\nobtained confirmation from the Bishop of Lincoln on November 17th.\r\nBut the validity of the proceedings was at once contested by Mr. John\r\nMartyll, one of the Fellows, on the ground of want of notice; and\r\nRote’s claim to the office was kept in suspense, pending an appeal\r\nto Rome. From the College accounts, the payments due to the Provost\r\nseem to have been made to Rote, under a salvo, pending the appeal.\r\nArchbishop Courtenay, who had lately succeeded Arundel, interfered, and\r\nsummoned the parties before him at Lambeth, where on 14th February,\r\n1415, Rote renounced his claims. A new election took place, at which\r\nDr. William Corffe was chosen; and he was confirmed by the Bishop of\r\nLincoln, on the 16th of March following, by John Martyll, his proxy.\r\nHe appears then to have been absent from England, representing the\r\nUniversity at the Council of Constance. From this embassy he perhaps\r\nnever returned; the proceedings of the Council record him as present in\r\nJune 1415; and a note in a MS. in the College library states that he\r\ndied at Constance. His name occurs as Provost in a deed dated 14th May,\r\n1416; and he is mentioned as “in remotis agens” 3rd April, 1417. His\r\ndeath may be presumed to have occurred about September 1417.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1429 to 1476, during which the College was under\r\nthe rule of its four great provosts--John Carpenter, Walter Lyhert,\r\nJohn Hals, and Henry Sampson--was one of exceptional brilliance and\r\nprosperity. Hitherto the College had been one of the most slenderly\r\nendowed; but during this period a stream of benefactions flowed in\r\nupon it, which materially altered its position. The first and most\r\nconsiderable addition which it received was the legacy of John Frank,\r\nMaster of the Rolls, who left the sum of £1000 for the support of four\r\nadditional Fellows. The money was judiciously invested in the purchase\r\nof the Manor of Wadley, near Faringdon, once the property of the Abbey\r\nof Stanley, Wilts, and which had lately been forfeited to the Crown.\r\nThis property was acquired in 1440, and the statute providing for the\r\nenlargement of the Foundation is dated 13th May, 1441. The adjoining\r\nestate of Littleworth was purchased some time later by Hals, then\r\nBishop of Lichfield, and also given to the College. The manors of Dene\r\nand Chalford,[136] in the parishes of Spelsbury and Enstone, Oxon, were\r\nacquired by Carpenter, who had become Bishop of Worcester in 1443, and\r\nwere given by his will to the College, for the support of a Fellow\r\nfrom the diocese of Worcester. Somewhat later William Smyth, Bishop\r\nof Lincoln, and afterwards one of the founders of Brasenose College,\r\nfounded another Fellowship for his own diocese, and endowed the College\r\nwith the manor of Shenington, near Banbury. The last considerable\r\naddition to the College property was made by Richard Dudley, sometime\r\nFellow, who in 1525 gave the manor of Swainswick, near Bath, to\r\nmaintain two Fellows. The whole of these new endowments, which exceed\r\nmany times over the value of the original possessions of the College,\r\nwere acquired in a period of less than a hundred years, and they are\r\nthe lasting memorial of what until recent times must be considered the\r\nmost splendid period in the College history.\r\n\r\nBy these benefactions the number of Fellows, fixed at ten in the\r\nFoundation Statutes, was raised to eighteen, at which it remained down\r\nto the changes of recent times. Four of these, founded by John Frank,\r\nwere to be chosen out of the counties of Wilts, Dorset, Somerset,\r\nand Devon; one, founded by Bishop Carpenter, from the diocese of\r\nWorcester; and one, founded by Bishop Smyth, from the diocese of\r\nLincoln. The two Fellowships founded by Dudley were not made subject\r\nto any restriction; but the College bound itself, in acknowledgment of\r\nCarpenter’s benefaction, to assign one of the original Fellowships also\r\nto the diocese of Worcester. This provision was repealed in 1821. There\r\nwere therefore from the reign of Henry VIII. onwards seven Fellowships\r\nlimited in the first instance to certain counties and dioceses, and\r\neleven which were subject to no restriction. And there never grew up\r\nat any time any class of junior members of the Foundation, entitled\r\nby statute or custom to succeed to Fellowships, or indeed any class\r\nwhatever, corresponding to the scholars, postmasters or demies, to\r\nbe found at most other Colleges. Certain Exhibitions were indeed\r\nestablished by Bishop Carpenter and Bishop Lyhert, and charged upon\r\nlands given by them to St. Anthony’s Hospital in London. Others, again,\r\nwere founded by Richard Dudley. But neither the Exhibitions of St.\r\nAnthony nor the Dudley Exhibitions ever grew to the least importance.\r\nThe small stipends originally assigned to them were never increased;\r\nand with the change in the value of money, they sank into complete\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nNew statutes to regulate these additions to the Foundation were enacted\r\nin 1441, 1483, and in 1507. From another statute in 1504 dates the\r\nestablishment of the College Register, which thenceforward becomes the\r\nsole authentic record of the history of the College. This Register is\r\ndirected to be kept not by the Provost, but by the Dean; and a similar\r\npractice was established about the same time in several other Colleges,\r\nsuch as Merton, where the Register begins in 1482, Magdalen, Brasenose,\r\nand others. It was probably thought that the duty would be better\r\ndischarged by a subordinate officer, who could be called to account\r\nby his superior, than by the Head himself, whose negligence it was no\r\none person’s business to correct. The Oriel Register, though first\r\ninstituted by the statute of 1504, contains also the record of some\r\ntransactions of earlier date; and the statute was probably intended\r\nto put upon a regular footing a practice which had already begun, and\r\nwhich was found to be of service. If this Register had been employed\r\nas the statute directed, in recording “omnia acta et decreta, per\r\nPraepositum et Scholares capitulariter facta,” it would be invaluable\r\nfor the history of the College; but unfortunately the tendency soon\r\nshowed itself to confine the entries to a limited number of cases, such\r\nas the elections and admissions of the Provost and Fellows, and to\r\nleave unnoticed many matters belonging to the ordinary daily life of\r\nthe Society, for the insertion of which no exact precedent was found.\r\nWhen at a later time the character of the College changed from a small\r\nSociety of graduate students to an educational institution, receiving\r\nundergraduate members, scarcely any notice is to be discovered in the\r\nRegister which betrays the existence of tutors or pupils, or of any\r\nother members of the Society besides the Provosts and Fellows.\r\n\r\nAnother important source of information is the series of Treasurer’s\r\naccounts, known as the Style. These begin in 1450, almost immediately\r\nafter the election of Provost Sampson, and the plan then introduced,\r\nof which he may possibly have been the author, has lasted in unbroken\r\ncontinuity to the present time. For some time this account records the\r\nwhole of the pecuniary transactions of the College; but after the\r\nact of Elizabeth (18 Eliz. c. 6) came into operation, and the surplus\r\nrevenue of each year became divisible among the Provost and Fellows,\r\nthe practice soon established itself of excluding from both sides of\r\nthe account items of a novel or exceptional character. The rents of\r\nthe College estates are given in the fullest detail; but no mention\r\nis made of the fines taken on the renewal of leases, although these\r\nbegan very early to form an important part of the College revenue. The\r\nwhole of the domestic side of the account, the charges upon members\r\noutside the Foundation, and the cost of their maintenance, the fees\r\npaid by undergraduates to tutors and College officers, servants’ wages,\r\nand other similar items, are nowhere noticed. When in the seventeenth\r\ncentury the whole fabric of the College was pulled down and rebuilt, it\r\nwould be difficult to find in the pages of the Style any entry which\r\nwould give a hint that any unusual outlay was in progress.\r\n\r\nThe century which followed the resignation of Provost Sampson in 1475,\r\npresents very little of general interest. At the visitation of the\r\nCollege by Atwater, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1520, among other matters\r\nof minor consequence, occurs the first recorded instance of an abuse\r\nwhich was probably then and for long afterwards not unfrequent. Thomas\r\nStock had resigned his Fellowship in favour of John Throckmorton,\r\nkeeping back his resignation until he was sure that Throckmorton\r\nwould be elected. “Hoc potest trahi in exemplum perniciosum. Ita quod\r\nin posterum socii resignabunt loca sua quibus voluerint. Dominus\r\ninjunxit ne deinceps aliquis talia faceret in electionibus ibidem.” The\r\nInjunctions of Bishop Longland, following on his visitation in 1531,\r\nseem to show a growing laxity of discipline. The Provost, then Thomas\r\nWare, is admonished to be personally resident in the College, and to\r\nattend more diligently to his duties. The Bachelors are to observe the\r\nregular hours of study in the library at night, and not to introduce\r\nstrangers into their sleeping-rooms. The new classical learning\r\n(“recentiores literae, lingua Latina, et opera poetica”) is not to be\r\npursued to the prejudice of the older studies, the “Termini Doctorum\r\nantiquorum.” The disputations and exercises are to be kept up as in\r\nformer times; the Provost, Dean, and senior masters are to attend the\r\ndisputations, and to be ready to solve the doubtful points. No Fellow\r\nis to go out of residence without the leave of the Provost or the\r\nDean, and then only for a limited time, whether in term or vacation.\r\nThe vacant Fellowships are to be filled up in a month’s time, and no\r\nFellowship to remain vacant in future longer than one month.\r\n\r\nFifteen years later another set of Injunctions was issued by the\r\nsame Bishop. The Fellows are again enjoined to be diligent in their\r\nstudies, giving themselves to philosophy for three years following\r\ntheir admission, and then going on to divinity. The unseemly behaviour\r\nof Mr. Edmund Crispyne calls for special reprimand; he is to give up\r\nblasphemy and profane swearing; he is not to let his beard grow, or\r\nto wear plaited shirts, or boots of a lay cut; he is to be respectful\r\nand obedient to the Provost and Dean, on pain of excommunication and\r\ndeprivation of his Fellowship. Mention is made of St. Mary Hall as a\r\nplace of education under the control of the College, but distinct from\r\nit. The door opening from the College into the Hall is to be walled\r\nup, and no communication between the two to be allowed henceforth. The\r\nCollege is to appoint a fit person to be Principal of the Hall, who is\r\nto provide suitable lectures for the instruction of the students there.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation makes but little mark in the recorded history of the\r\nCollege. No difficulty was met with by the King’s Commissioner, Dr.\r\nCox, when he came in 1534 to require the acknowledgment of the Royal\r\nsupremacy. Four years later came the orders for depriving Becket of the\r\nhonours of saintship, and for removing his name from all service-books.\r\nThe thoroughness with which these orders were carried out is remarkably\r\nillustrated at Oriel, where even in so obscure a place as the Calendar\r\nprefixed to the Register of College Muniments, the days marked for\r\nthe observance of St. Thomas have been carefully obliterated. There\r\nwas, however, one member of Oriel, Edward Powell, who distinguished\r\nhimself by his opposition to the King’s policy. He had been Fellow of\r\nthe College from about 1495 to 1505; afterwards he became Canon of\r\nSalisbury, and also held other ecclesiastical preferments. On the\r\nfirst appearance of Luther’s writings he was selected by the University\r\nas one of the defenders of orthodoxy, and recommended as such to the\r\nKing. When, however, the question of the King’s divorce arose, Powell\r\nwas retained by Queen Katherine as her ablest advocate; and from that\r\ntime he was conspicuous by his resistance to the King. In 1540 he\r\nwas hanged, drawn, and quartered at Smithfield for denying the Royal\r\nsupremacy, and for refusing to take the oath of succession.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of the College Register the affairs of St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital play a much more important part than any changes in religion.\r\nIt was in 1536 that the long-standing dispute between the College\r\nand the City respecting the payment appropriated to the support of\r\nthe almsmen was finally settled. The charge, £23 0_s._ 5_d._, out of\r\nthe fee farm rent of the town, had been granted by Henry I. on the\r\nfirst establishment of the Hospital; but ever since the annexation\r\nto the College by Edward III., great difficulty had been experienced\r\nin obtaining punctual payment. Charters confirming the charge had\r\nbeen obtained from nearly every sovereign through the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries; but the City persevered in disputing its\r\nliability. In 1536 both parties agreed to stand to the award of two\r\nBarons of the Exchequer, and by their decision the payment was settled\r\nat the reduced amount of £19 a year, and the nomination of the almsmen\r\nwas transferred to the city.\r\n\r\nOn the resignation of Provost Haynes in 1550, the King’s Council\r\nendeavoured to procure the election of Dr. William Turner, a prominent\r\nProtestant divine, honourably known as one of the fathers of English\r\nBotany. The Fellows, perhaps anticipating interference, held their\r\nelection on the day of Haynes’ resignation, and chose Mr. John\r\nSmyth, afterwards Margaret Professor of Divinity. Smyth was promptly\r\ndespatched to the Bishop of Lincoln for confirmation, and on his return\r\nto the College was duly installed Provost. Some days afterwards the\r\nDean was summoned to attend the Council and to give an account of the\r\nCollege proceedings. His explanations were apparently accepted, and\r\nno further action was taken. Smyth retained his place through all\r\nthe changes of religion under Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. On his\r\nresignation in 1565, Roger Marbeck of Christchurch, and Public Orator,\r\nwas chosen, although not statutably qualified, having never been a\r\nFellow. It is possible, though not hinted at in the account of the\r\nelection, that he was recommended either by the Queen or by some other\r\npowerful personage; and a dispensation was obtained from the Visitor\r\nauthorising a departure from the regulations of the Statutes. Marbeck\r\nheld the office only two years, and was succeeded by John Belly,\r\nProvost 1566 to 1574.\r\n\r\nThe long reign of the next Provost, Anthony Blencowe, covers the\r\nperiod of transition from the old to the new era. The College of the\r\nmedieval type consisted of the Fellows only. Already Bachelors of\r\nArts at the time of their election, they carried on their studies\r\nunder the direction of the Head and seniors, proceeding to the\r\nhigher degrees, and ultimately passing from Oxford to ecclesiastical\r\nemployment elsewhere. William of Wykeham had indeed made one important\r\ninnovation on the type which Walter de Merton had created; for the\r\nyounger members of his foundation were admitted direct from school, and\r\nonly obtained their first University degree after they had been some\r\nyears at College. The example of New College was followed at Magdalen\r\nand Corpus; but in these cases, as at New College, the admission of\r\nundergraduates was only introduced as part of the regulations for\r\nmembers of the Foundation, and it was not in contemplation to make the\r\nCollege a school for all comers. No doubt a few _extranei_, graduate\r\nor undergraduate, were occasionally admitted to share the Fellows’\r\ntable, and to profit by their advice and companionship; but the bulk\r\nof the younger students remained outside the Colleges, lodging in the\r\nnumerous Halls in the town, and subject only to the discipline of the\r\nUniversity. Instances of such _extranei_ are Thomas Arundel, already\r\nmentioned as a member of Oriel in the fourteenth century; Henry, Prince\r\nof Wales, afterwards Henry V., at Queen’s College; Doctor Thomas\r\nGascoigne, who at different times resided at Oriel, at Lincoln, and\r\nat New College. This class survived to recent times in the Fellow\r\ncommoners, or gentlemen commoners, whose connexion with the Colleges\r\nis historically older than the more numerous and important class of\r\ncommoners, which has overshadowed and ultimately extinguished them.\r\nIt is worth observing that the three Colleges of William of Wykeham’s\r\ntype, New College, Magdalen, and Corpus, although they received\r\ngentlemen commoners, did not admit ordinary commoners until the changes\r\nwhich followed on the University Commission of 1854. All Souls has\r\nremained to the present day a College of Fellows alone.\r\n\r\nThe religious changes of the sixteenth century were followed by great\r\nalterations in the discipline of the University. Acting on pressure\r\nfrom without, a Statute was passed in 1581 requiring all matriculated\r\nstudents to reside in a College or Hall. The old Halls had nearly all\r\ndisappeared; of the few remaining most were connected more or less\r\nclosely with one of the Colleges. Queen’s College claimed, and was\r\nsuccessful in retaining, St. Edmund’s Hall. Merton had purchased Alban\r\nHall in the earlier part of the century. Magdalen Hall was dependent\r\non Magdalen College. The connexion between Oriel and St. Mary Hall was\r\nolder and closer than any. The Principal was, invariably, chosen or\r\nappointed from among the Fellows. The holders of the small Exhibitions\r\nfounded by Bishop Carpenter and Dr. Dudley were lodged not in the\r\nCollege but in the Hall; in times of plague the members of the Hall\r\nwere allowed to remove to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, for a purer\r\nair. In the census of the University, taken in 1572, Oriel appears\r\nto have numbered forty-two members; of these the Provost and Fellows\r\naccount for nineteen; three were servants; the remaining twenty, one\r\nof whom may be perhaps identified with Sir Walter Raleigh, represent\r\nthe favoured class of _extranei_, of which we have already spoken.\r\nIn the same year the members of St. Mary Hall numbered forty-six.\r\nThe next half century sees this proportion completely reversed. The\r\nmatriculations at Oriel from 1581 to 1621 average a little over ten\r\na year; those at St. Mary Hall sink to five. The control over the\r\nHall was taken away by the Chancellor, Lord Leicester, though the\r\nCollege might well have made out as good a claim as that successfully\r\nasserted by Queen’s College over St. Edmund’s Hall. But the Principals\r\ncontinued to be chosen from among Fellows of Oriel down to the time of\r\nthe Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, the Register contains but few notices from\r\nwhich it could be gathered that any great change in the character of\r\nthe College took place at this time. In 1585 the Provost admonishes the\r\nFellows as to the behaviour of their scholars, and they are ordered\r\nto be responsible to the butler for the battels of their scholars or\r\npupils. In 1594 an order was made that no Fellow should have more than\r\none poor scholar under the name of batler. In 1595 the Dean is invested\r\nwith the power of catechising. In 1606 one of the Fellows is appointed\r\npublic catechist for the instruction of the youth, as required by\r\nUniversity Statute. In 1624 a Mr. Jones, not a Fellow, is appointed, on\r\nhis own application, Praelector in Greek. A Register of the admission\r\nof commensales, that is the members of the higher order only, or Fellow\r\ncommoners, was begun in 1596, and continued to 1610. It contains\r\neighteen names only, the first being that of Robert Pierrepont,\r\nafterwards Earl of Kingston. With this exception the admissions into\r\nthe College have to be collected from the University Matriculation\r\nRegister, supplemented from about 1620 by the Caution Book.\r\n\r\nIt was this enlargement of its numbers that made it necessary for the\r\nCollege to take in hand the question of rebuilding the fabric in a\r\nmanner suitable to the new requirements. The buildings then existing\r\nhad been erected at different times, and had gradually been brought\r\ninto the form of a quadrangle, occupying the site of the older part\r\nof the present College. These are shown in Neale’s drawing, made in\r\n1566. The chapel on the south side was that built by Richard, Earl of\r\nArundel, about 1373. The Hall on the north side had been rebuilt about\r\nthe year 1535, partly by the contributions of former Fellows. Provost\r\nBlencowe died in 1618, and was succeeded by Mr. William Lewis, Chaplain\r\nto Lord Bacon, and afterwards Master of St. Cross, and Prebendary of\r\nWinchester. Lewis’ election was not unanimous, and though he was duly\r\npresented to the Bishop of Lincoln and confirmed by him, he thought\r\nit necessary to obtain a further ratification of his title from his\r\npatron. This proceeding is remarkable, as it is almost the solitary\r\ninstance in which the original statutes of January 1326, superseded\r\nalmost immediately after their issue by the Lincoln statutes of May\r\nin the same year, were quoted or acted upon. The Chancellor, assuming\r\ncognizance of the case as of an election in discord, pronounced in\r\nfavour of Lewis, and by an order entered in the College Register and\r\nauthenticated by his own hand, confirmed Lewis in his place. Lewis\r\nheld the office for three years only, during which time, however,\r\nthe design of the new building was determined upon, and the first\r\npart completed. Blencowe had left the sum of £1300 to be applied in\r\nthe first instance to the west side--“the primaria pars Collegii.”\r\nThis was undertaken in 1619, and in the following year the south side\r\nwas also taken down and rebuilt. Besides Blencowe’s legacy, £300 was\r\nforthcoming from a College fund, and plate was sold to the value of\r\n£90. The College groves at Stowford and Bartlemas supplied some of the\r\ntimber; the stone came from the College quarry at Headington. Timber\r\nwas also sold from other College estates. But it was in obtaining\r\ncontributions from former members, and from great people connected\r\nwith Oriel, that Provost Lewis’ talent was most remarkable. His skill\r\nin writing letters--“elegant, in a winning, persuasive way”--was long\r\nquoted as an example to other heads of Colleges. This “art, in which\r\nhe excelled,” had recommended him to Lord Bacon, and it was by his\r\npatron’s advice that he employed it in the service of the College.\r\nAmong those whom he laid under contribution were the Earl of Kingston\r\nand Sir Robert Harley, whose arms are still to be seen in the windows\r\nof the Hall. Lewis resigned the Provostship in 1621, and was succeeded\r\nby John Tolson. The completion of the new quadrangle was postponed for\r\nsome years, though the design had probably been determined on from the\r\nfirst. In 1636 large sums of money were again raised by contributions\r\nfrom present and former members, and the north and east sides of the\r\nquadrangle were erected.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the new College is in its main features similar to that of\r\nWadham, erected 1613, and of University, which was built some years\r\nafter Oriel. In all of these the chapel and hall stand together\r\nopposite to the gateway, and form one side of a quadrangle. The other\r\nthree sides are of uniform height, consisting of three stories,\r\ncontaining chambers for the Fellows and other members. In Oriel the\r\nlibrary occupied a part of the upper story on the north side. The hall\r\nis approached by a flight of steps under a portico on the centre of the\r\neast side; above this portico are the figures of the Virgin and Child,\r\nto whom the College is dedicated, and of King Edward II., the founder,\r\nand King Charles I. in whose reign it was set up. Round the portico ran\r\nthe legend in stone--“Regnante Carolo.” By an unaccountable blunder,\r\nthis last figure has been described in all accounts of the College as\r\nbeing that of King Edward III.; but there can be no doubt, both from\r\nthe dress and from the features, that it represents King Charles, and\r\nno one else. Over the doorways round the quadrangle were stone shields\r\nbearing the arms of the four great benefactors--Frank, Carpenter,\r\nSmyth, and Dudley, and of the three Provosts--Blencowe, Lewis,\r\nand Tolson--under whom the new building was planned and executed.\r\nBlencowe’s are also to be seen in the treasury in the tower, and upon\r\nthe College gate. The whole building was completed in 1642, when the\r\nchapel was first used for divine service.\r\n\r\nThis great work had scarcely been completed when the Civil War broke\r\nout. In January 1642-3, the King being at Oxford, the College plate\r\nwas demanded: 29 lbs. 0 oz. 5 dwt. of gilt, and 52 lbs. 7 oz. 14 dwt.\r\nof white plate was given, the College retaining only its founder’s\r\ncup, and two other small articles--a mazer bowl and a cocoa-nut\r\ncup, believed to have been the gift of Bishop Carpenter. A few days\r\nafterwards a weekly contribution of £40 was assessed upon the Colleges\r\nand Halls for the expenses of fortifying the city; the charge upon\r\nOriel was fixed at £1. This charge was joyfully acquiesced in by\r\nthe College, “ita quod faxit Deus Musae una cum Rege suo contra\r\ningrassantes hostium turmas tutius agant ac felicius.” But these hopes\r\nwere not to be realised; and the hardships of the siege soon came to\r\ntell heavily on the College finances. The high price of provisions,\r\nthe difficulty of getting in rents, the debts incurred for the\r\nCollege building, must have seriously crippled their resources; and\r\ngrievous complaints of their inability to complete the October audit\r\noccur in the years 1643, 1644, and 1645. In the last of these years\r\nextraordinary expedients had to be resorted to in order to maintain\r\neven the common table; leases were renewed or promised in reversion\r\non almost any terms; the Oxford tenants were solicited to pay their\r\nrents in advance, on the promise of considerate treatment at their\r\nnext renewal; all the timber at Bartlemas was felled at one stroke and\r\nconverted into money. Even these heroic remedies were inadequate; and\r\nin March 1645-6 the commons’ allowance was reduced to one-half, and\r\nthe elections to vacant Fellowships suspended. The surrender of the\r\ncity to the Parliament in the summer of 1646 must have been felt as a\r\ngreat relief. From that time, although the times were not altogether\r\nprosperous, the distress of the years of siege never reappeared with\r\nthe same acuteness. The numbers of the undergraduate members, which\r\nhad sunk to almost nothing, soon revived; and the College was able\r\nto build a Ball Court for their diversion in the back part of their\r\npremises. The Hospital of St. Bartholomew was rebuilt in 1651. Although\r\nnow converted to other uses, this good gray stone house, with its eight\r\nchambers for the eight almsmen, still stands and bears its history\r\non its face. On the several doorways, and also on the chapel, which,\r\nthough not rebuilt, was refitted and beautified, are the date of the\r\nwork, and the initials of the College,[137] the Provost, and the\r\nTreasurers.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Visitation which descended upon Oxford in the year\r\nfollowing the siege dealt on the whole very tenderly with Oriel. It is\r\npossible that Prynne, an old Oriel man, who was an active member of\r\nthe London Committee, may have stood its friend. The answers of the\r\nProvost and Fellows to the Visitors’ questions were in almost every\r\ncase such as merited expulsion; but in the result only five Fellows\r\nwere removed, and of these two were soon afterwards allowed to return\r\nto their place. Two Fellowships were suspended by the Visitors’ order,\r\nin order to pay off the debts under which the College lay. Others were\r\nfilled up by the Visitors or the London Committee during the years 1648\r\nand 1652. After the latter year no further interference seems to have\r\ntaken place, and on the death of Saunders, in 1652-3, Robert Say was\r\nelected in the accustomed form, and admitted without any confirmation\r\nfrom external authority. He held office till 1691, when he died after a\r\nlong but uneventful reign of nearly forty years.\r\n\r\nOf the Fellows of the College during the seventeenth century, not\r\nmany achieved any distinction. Humphrey Lloyd, elected Fellow in\r\n1631, and removed by the Visitors in 1648, became Bishop of Bangor.\r\nWilliam Talbot, successively Bishop of Oxford, Salisbury, and Durham;\r\nSir John Holt, who, after the Revolution, became Lord Chief Justice\r\nof England; and Sir William Scroggs, one of his predecessors, who\r\ngained an unenviable reputation in the political trials which arose\r\nout of the Popish Plot, were educated at Oriel, but were not Fellows.\r\nThe most eminent name among the Fellows is undoubtedly John Robinson,\r\nBishop of Bristol and afterwards of London, Lord Privy Seal, and the\r\nchief negotiator of the Peace of Utrecht. Soon after his election in\r\n1675, he obtained leave to reside abroad, as chaplain to the English\r\nMinister at Stockholm. His benefactions to the College will be more\r\nconveniently mentioned later. With these exceptions the list of\r\nFellows contains very few eminent names; and the same remark continues\r\nto be true in the main throughout the eighteenth century. The truth\r\nprobably is that the system of election to Fellowships was tainted\r\nwith corruption. Buying and selling of places was a common practice\r\nin the age of the Restoration, and it has survived to our own time in\r\nthe army. In many Colleges this evil was to some extent kept in check\r\nby the establishment of a regular succession from Scholars to Fellows;\r\nbut at Oriel, as has been already observed, the choice of the electors\r\nwas absolutely free, and, valuable as this freedom may be when honestly\r\nexercised, it is capable of leading to corruption of the worst kind. In\r\n1673 a complaint was made to the Bishop of Lincoln, the Visitor, by\r\nJames Davenant, Fellow, against the conduct of the Provost at a recent\r\nelection. The Bishop issued a commission to the Vice-Chancellor (Peter\r\nMews, Bishop of Bath and Wells), Dr. Fell (Dean of Christ Church), and\r\nDr. Yates (Principal of Brasenose), to visit the College. The conduct\r\nof the business seems to have been chiefly in Fell’s hands; and in his\r\nletters to the Bishop he expresses in strong terms his opinion of the\r\nstate of things he found in Oriel. He writes, 1st Aug. 1673--“When\r\nthis Devil of buying & selling is once cast out your Lordship will I\r\nhope take care that he return not again lest he bring seven worse than\r\nhimself into the house after ’tis swept and garnisht.” He recommends\r\nvarious regulations for checking the evil; among them that the election\r\nbe by the major part of the whole Society, “else ’twill always be\r\nin the Provost’s power to watch his opportunity & when the house is\r\nthin strike up an election”; also that the successor be immediately\r\nadmitted, “for there is a cheat in some houses by keeping the successor\r\nout for a good while after the election.” The Bishop on this report\r\nissued a decree, 24th Jan., 1673-4, prescribing the proceeding in\r\nelections. Not to be baffled, the Provost, Say, hit upon the ingenious\r\ndevice of obtaining a Royal letter of recommendation for the candidate\r\nwhose election he desired, and a letter was sent in favour of Thomas\r\nTwitty for the next vacancy. He was probably elected and admitted upon\r\nthis recommendation; though the Vice-Chancellor refused to allow him to\r\nsubscribe as Fellow. The Bishop made his remonstrances at Court, and\r\nobtained the withdrawal of the King’s letter, and Twitty’s election\r\nwas annulled before it had been entered in the College Register. The\r\nProvost seems to have written an insolent letter to the Bishop, such\r\n(says Fell) “as in another age a valianter man would not have written\r\nto a Visitor.” Fell goes on--“Though I am afraid that with a very\r\nlittle diligence the being a party to Twitty’s proceedings may be\r\nmade out, yet it will not be safe to animadvert on that act, however\r\ncriminal, as a fault, for notwithstanding the present concession, the\r\nCourt will never endure to have the prerogative of laying laws asleep\r\ncalled in question. As to the letter I think ’twill be much the best\r\nway not to answer it. It is below the dignity of a Visitor to contest\r\nin empty words. If the Provost goes on with his Hectoring ’tis possible\r\nhe may run himself so in the briers that ’twill not be easy for him to\r\nget out.”\r\n\r\nThe regulations of Bishop Fuller were more fully established by a\r\nstatute made by the College with the Visitor’s approval in 1721,\r\nwhen the day of election was fixed to the Friday in Easter week, and\r\nthe examination on the Thursday before. But new disputes had already\r\nbegun which led to unexpected but most important consequences. At the\r\nFellowship election in July 1721, Henry Edmunds, of Jesus, the hero of\r\nthe ensuing struggle, received the votes of nine Fellows against those\r\nof three other Fellows and the Provost. The Provost rejected Edmunds\r\nand admitted his own candidate. Edmunds appealed to the Visitor, who\r\nupheld the Provost. On the Friday after Easter, 1723, Edmunds stood\r\nagain, and he and four other candidates were chosen by a majority of\r\nthe electors into the five vacant Fellowships. The Provost refused to\r\nadmit them, and was again upheld by the Visitor, who claimed that the\r\nright of filling up the vacancies had devolved upon himself. Three\r\nplaces he proceeded to fill up at once; as to the other two he seems\r\nto have been in consultation with the Provost as to his choice, but\r\nnot to have made any nomination. At the election in the following\r\nApril 1724, two candidates received the votes of eight of the Fellows,\r\nagainst the votes of the Provost and of one other Fellow only, Mr.\r\nJoseph Bowles. The Provost as before refused to admit them. Edmunds now\r\nbrought his action in the Common Pleas on behalf of himself and his\r\nfour companions, claiming to have been legally elected. He took his\r\nstand on the original Foundation Statutes of January 1326, and claimed\r\nthat the Crown and not the Bishop of Lincoln was the true and lawful\r\nVisitor of the College. These statutes, as has been already mentioned,\r\nwere superseded within six months of their issue, and although in a\r\nfew rare instances, questions had been brought before the King or his\r\nChancellor, the Visitatorial authority of the Bishop had never before\r\nbeen disputed, but had been repeatedly exercised and acquiesced in for\r\nfour hundred years. The case was tried at bar, before Chief Justice\r\nEyre, and the three puisne judges, and a special jury; and on the 14th\r\nMay, 1726, judgment was given in Edmunds’ favour. The authority of the\r\nstatutes of Jan. 1326 was established, and the Crown declared to be\r\nthe sole Visitor. Edmunds and his four co-plaintiffs, as also the two\r\ncandidates chosen in 1724, were admitted to their Fellowships in July\r\n1726 by the Dean, the Provost refusing, on the ingenious plea that if\r\nthe Crown was Visitor, it was for the Crown and not for the Common\r\nPleas to decide on the validity of the election.\r\n\r\nDr. Carter died in September 1727, and notwithstanding his disagreement\r\nwith the Fellows, he showed his affection for the College by leaving\r\nto it his whole residuary estate. He had already, by the help of\r\nBishop Robinson, obtained the annexation to his office of a prebend at\r\nRochester, and he provided for its further endowment by leaving £1000\r\nfor the purchase of a living to be held by the Provost. With this\r\nmoney the living of Purleigh, in Essex, was bought in 1730. Hitherto\r\nthe Provostship had been but scantily endowed. The Parliamentary\r\nVisitors in 1648 had scheduled it as one of the Headships that required\r\naugmentation. The fixed stipend and the allowances prescribed by the\r\nstatutes had, with the change in the value of money, shrunk to small\r\nproportions; the principal part of his income was derived from the\r\ndividend and the fines.\r\n\r\nBoth these sources of income were of modern growth. By the Act 18\r\nEliz., leases of College estates were limited to twenty-one years, and\r\none-third of the old rent was to be reserved in corn. House property\r\nmight be let for not longer than forty years. The beneficial effect of\r\nthese Acts on the corporate revenue was not immediate; in many cases\r\nlong terms had been granted shortly before, which did not expire for\r\nmany years. Notably the College estate at Wadley had been let in 1539\r\nfor 208 years; and in 1736, when this long period was approaching its\r\nend, the lessees petitioned Parliament to interfere and prevent them\r\nbeing deprived of what they had so long treated as their own property.\r\nBut few leases were of this extravagant duration; and in the course of\r\nthe seventeenth century the College income was considerably increased.\r\nThe Provost, however, received no more than one Fellow’s share and a\r\nhalf in the dividend, _i. e._ the surplus income of the year, and one\r\nshare only of the fines. The ecclesiastical preferment which Provost\r\nCarter secured to the Headship resulted in making it one of the best\r\nendowed places in Oxford, without imposing any additional charge on the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nBishop Robinson, who obtained the Rochester stall for the Provost, was\r\nalso a benefactor in other ways. He founded three Exhibitions, to be\r\nheld by bachelor students; and he also erected at his own expense an\r\nadditional building on the east side of the College garden, containing\r\nsix sets of chambers, three of which were to be occupied by his\r\nExhibitioners. Dr. Carter erected at the same time a similar building\r\non the west side.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the decision given in the Court of Common Pleas, was to\r\nrestore the authority of the Foundation Statutes of January 1326. Under\r\nthese Statutes only an actual Fellow could be chosen Provost, and the\r\nelection must be unanimous. On Dr. Carter’s death, Mr. Walter Hodges\r\nwas chosen by a majority of votes only, but he was confirmed by the\r\nLord Chancellor, Lord King, upon whom, under these circumstances, the\r\nelection had devolved. Henceforward, the Fellows agreed to make the\r\nformal election unanimous in every case, and no further instance of a\r\ndisputed election occurred.\r\n\r\nThe history of the College during the remainder of the eighteenth\r\ncentury was quiet, decorous and uneventful. Its undergraduate members\r\nwere drawn from all classes, but always included many young men of rank\r\nand family. Some of these showed their affection for the College in\r\nafter life by benefactions more or less important. Henry, fourth Duke\r\nof Beaufort, founded four exhibitions for the counties of Gloucester,\r\nMonmouth and Glamorgan. Mrs. Ludwell, a sister of Dr. Carter, gave an\r\nestate in Kent for the support of two exhibitioners from that county.\r\nEdward, Lord Leigh, who died in 1786, bequeathed to the College\r\nthe entire collection of books in his house at Stoneleigh. For the\r\nreception of this bequest, the new Library was built in the following\r\nyear at the north end of the College garden.\r\n\r\nOf the few eminent names connected with the College in the last\r\ncentury, that of Bishop Butler is the greatest. He entered Oriel in\r\n1715, and his early rise in his profession was in a great measure due\r\nto the acquaintance he there made with Charles Talbot, afterwards Lord\r\nChancellor, who recommended him to the patronage of his father, the\r\nBishop of Durham, also an old member of the College. William Hawkins,\r\nelected Fellow in 1700, was an eminent lawyer, whose treatise of the\r\nPleas of the Crown still keeps its place as a standard legal work.\r\nWilliam Gerrard Hamilton, admitted in 1745, is still remembered as an\r\nearly patron of Burke, and for his speech in the great debate in Nov.\r\n1755, by which he gained his nickname. Gilbert White, of Selborne,\r\namong all the Fellows of Oriel of this period, has left the most\r\nlasting name. Yet his College history is in curious contrast to the\r\nreputation which is popularly attached to him. Instead of being, as\r\nis often supposed, the model clergyman, residing on his cure, and\r\ninterested in all the concerns of the parish in which his duty lay,\r\nhe was, from a College point of view, a rich, sinecure, pluralist\r\nnon-resident. He held his Fellowship for fifty years, 1743-1793, during\r\nwhich period he was out of residence except for the year 1752-3, when\r\nthe Proctorship fell to the College turn, and he came up to claim it.\r\nIn 1757 he similarly asserted his right to take and hold with his\r\nFellowship the small College living of Moreton Pinkney, Northants,\r\nwith the avowed intention of not residing. Even at that time the\r\nconscience of the College was shocked at this proposal, and the claim\r\nwas only reluctantly admitted. White continued to enjoy the emoluments\r\nof his Fellowship and of his College living, while he resided on his\r\npatrimonial estate at Selborne; and although it was much doubted\r\nwhether his fortune did not exceed the amount which was allowed by the\r\nStatutes, he acted on the maxim that anything can be held by a man who\r\ncan hold his tongue, and he continued to enjoy his Fellowship and his\r\nliving till his death.\r\n\r\nIt was not till near the close of the century that the College took\r\nthe decisive step which at once lifted it above its old level of\r\nrespectable mediocrity, and gave it the first place in Oxford. As has\r\nbeen already shown, the election to Fellowships was singularly free\r\nfrom restriction; for most of them there was no limitation of birth,\r\nlocality, or kindred; and no class of junior members had any title to\r\nsuccession or preference. When in 1795 Edward Copleston was invited\r\nfrom Corpus to stand for the vacant Fellowship, the first precedent\r\nwas set for making the Oriel Fellowship the highest prize of an Oxford\r\ncareer. The old habit of giving weight to personal recommendations was\r\nnot at once immediately laid aside. Even when Thomas Arnold was elected\r\nin 1815, it was still necessary for the Fellows to be lectured against\r\nallowing themselves to be prejudiced by the reports in Oxford that\r\nthe candidate was a forward and conceited young man. But the better\r\nprinciple had the victory: the last election in which the older motives\r\nwere allowed to prevail was in 1798, and from that time the College\r\ncontinued year after year to renew itself without fear or favour out of\r\nthe most brilliant and promising of the younger students.\r\n\r\nIt was the head of Oriel, Provost Eveleigh, who, backed by the growing\r\nreputation of his College, induced the Hebdomadal Board to institute\r\nthe new system of examination for honours. Under this system Oriel\r\nsoon took and long retained the first place. It was an Oriel Fellow\r\nwho, as Headmaster of the Grammar School at Rugby, succeeded, as was\r\nforetold of him, in changing the whole face of Public School Education\r\nin this country. It was another Fellow who brought about that religious\r\nmovement which has worked a still greater change in the Church of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Provosts._\r\n\r\n    1326.

MAGRATH, D.D., PROVOST OF QUEEN’S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now just five centuries and a half since Robert of Eglesfield\r\nfounded “the Hall of the scholars of the Queen” in Oxford. The Royal\r\nlicense for its foundation was sealed in the Tower of London on the\r\neighteenth of January, and the statutes of the founder were corrected,\r\ncompleted and sealed in Oxford on the tenth of February in the year\r\n1340 as men then reckoned, or as we should say 1341.\r\n\r\nEglesfield was chaplain and confessor to Philippa, Queen of Edward\r\nIII. He came of gentle blood in Cumberland, and had ten years before\r\nreceived from the King the hamlet and manor of Ravenwyk or Renwick,\r\nforfeited through rebellion by Andrew of Harcla. This and the property\r\nhe had purchased in Oxford as a site for his hall was all that\r\nEglesfield was able of himself to contribute to its maintenance. His\r\nrelations with the Queen and the King were, however, of priceless\r\nservice to the new foundation.\r\n\r\nEglesfield seems to have continued for the remainder of his life to\r\nhave fostered by his presence and influence the institution he had\r\nfounded. In the earliest of the “Long Rolls,” or yearly accounts of\r\nthe College, which are preserved, that of 1347-8, his name appears at\r\nthe head of the list of the members. In that year sixteen pence is\r\npaid for the hire of a horse for six days, that he may visit London on\r\nthe Thursday after the feast of St. Augustine, bishop of the English;\r\ntwenty-three shillings is paid for a horse for him to go to Southampton\r\nabout the time of the festival of St. Peter _ad vincula_; William of\r\nHawkesworth, Provost of Oriel, a former Fellow, lends him a horse,\r\nand a penny is put down for a shoe for the same, and a halfpenny for\r\nparchment bought for him for documents executed on the feast of Saints\r\nCosmo and Damian.\r\n\r\nHis funeral is celebrated in 1351-2. They made a “great burning for\r\nhim,” as of seventeen and a quarter pounds of wax, costing nine\r\nshillings, expended during the year, eleven pounds were used at the\r\nfuneral of the founder. Fourpence halfpenny only seems to have been\r\nspent on wine on the same occasion.\r\n\r\nA casket containing his remains was transferred from the old chapel to\r\nthe vault under the new chapel when the latter was built.\r\n\r\nHis horn is still used on gaudy-days as the loving-cup. It must have\r\nbeen mounted in something like its present condition almost from the\r\nbeginning, as in the Long Roll of 1416-7 sixteen pence is paid “pro\r\nemendatione aquilae crateris fundatoris.” Other repairs are mentioned\r\nlater as in 1584-5, “pro reparatione particulae coronae quae circumdat\r\noperculum cornu xii d.; item, pro reparandis aliis partibus cornu xviii\r\nd.”\r\n\r\nHis name is also kept alive by the “canting” custom observed in the\r\nCollege on New Year’s Day, when after dinner the Bursar presents to\r\neach guest a needle threaded with silk of a colour suitable to his\r\nfaculty (_aiguille et fil_), and prays for his prosperity in the words\r\n“Take this and be thrifty.”[138]\r\n\r\nThe object with which the College was founded is set forth in the\r\nstatutes as “the cultivation of Theology to the glory of God, the\r\nadvance of the Church, and the salvation of souls.” It was to be a\r\nCollegiate Hall of Masters, Chaplains, Theologians, and other scholars\r\nto be advanced to the order of the priesthood. It was founded in the\r\nname of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, to the Glory of our Lord\r\nand of His Mother and of the whole Court of Heaven, for the benefit\r\nof the Universal Church and especially of the Church of England,\r\nfor the prosperity of the King and Queen and their children, and\r\nfor the salvation of their souls and the souls of their progenitors\r\nand successors, and of the souls of the founder’s family and his\r\nbenefactors, especially William of Muskham, Rector of the Church of\r\nDereham, and for the “_salutare suffragium_” of all the living and the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe benefactions of Muskham do not seem to have ceased with the\r\nfoundation of the College. In 1347 Roger Swynbrok goes to Dereham\r\non behalf of the College to get money from Muskham, and the hire of\r\nhis horse costs eightpence, and there are entries of money received\r\nfrom Muskham in later years. Other persons besides the members of the\r\nCollege were interested in him, as in 1362 the oblations for his soul\r\nand the soul of John de Hotham the second Provost amounted to £29\r\n16_s._ 11½_d._\r\n\r\nThe statutes lay down with considerable minuteness of detail the course\r\nof life which Eglesfield expected the members of his foundation to\r\nfollow, and, in connection with the early accounts of the College,\r\nwhich have been preserved with tolerable completeness, give us some\r\nmaterials for an account of the social life in the College during the\r\nearlier portion of its history.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, indeed, that the large and complex establishment, whose\r\ndetails are developed in Eglesfield’s statutes, rather represent what\r\nhe wished for and aimed at than the actual condition of the College at\r\nany time; but there seems to have been always in the College a sincere\r\ndesire to carry out, so far as was possible, the prescriptions of the\r\nfounder; and, as we shall see, some of his minutest directions have\r\nregulated the practice of the College ever since his days.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the Hall, “the advowson” as he calls it, was to be\r\nvested in his Royal mistress Philippa, and in the Queens consort of\r\nEngland who shall succeed her. He adds the characteristic detail that,\r\nif a king dies before his successor is married, the patronage shall be\r\ncontinued to the widow till a Queen consort comes into being.\r\n\r\nPhilippa had already procured from her husband for the infant College\r\nthe Church of Brough under Staynesmore, and this was to be only an\r\nearnest of the benefits the College was to derive from the lofty\r\npatronage the founder thus secured to it. She was the first queen to\r\nbe distinguished as patroness and foundress of a Collegiate Hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1353-4, which seems to have been a year of unusual expense to the\r\nCollege, among the donations received xxvj pounds iiij shillings is\r\ncredited to “domina Regina.”\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless through the Queen’s influence that the King in 1343\r\nendowed the College with the advowson of Bletchingdon, and in the\r\nfollowing year with the Wardenship of St. Julian’s Hospital, commonly\r\ncalled God’s House, in Southampton.\r\n\r\nThe College seems always to have been careful to secure the patronage\r\nof the Queens consort of England. In the muniment room is preserved a\r\nletter from Anne, Richard II.’s queen, to her husband, asking him to\r\ngrant letters patent to the College.\r\n\r\nIn 1603, on the 3rd of August, 48_s._ 6_d._ is allowed to the Provost\r\nfor his journey “ad solicitandam dominam reginam pro patronatu\r\ncollegii.” This was another Anne, James I.’s wife. A bible was\r\npresented to the Queen which cost 42_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nIt was through Henrietta Maria--Queen Mary, as the College delights\r\nto call her--that Charles I. was supplicated for the advowsons in\r\nHampshire given by the King to the College in 1626. Caroline, George\r\nII.’s queen, gave £1000 towards the rebuilding of the College in the\r\neighteenth century; and promised another £1000, which, owing to her\r\ndeath, still (as the Benefactors’ Book says) remains “unpaid but not\r\nunhoped for.” Charlotte, George III.’s consort, heads the list of those\r\nwho subscribed towards the rebuilding of the south-west wing after the\r\nfire of 1778. Queen Adelaide was the last queen entertained within the\r\nwalls of the College.\r\n\r\nThe community was to consist of a Provost and twelve Fellows,\r\nincorporated under the name of “the Hall of the Queen in Oxford,” with\r\na common seal.\r\n\r\nThe original body was nominated by the founder, and their names are set\r\nforth in his statutes.\r\n\r\nThe number thirteen was chosen with reference to the number of our Lord\r\nand His Apostles, “sub mysterio decursus Christi et Apostolorum in\r\nterris.”\r\n\r\nRichard of Retteford, Doctor of Divinity, was the first Provost, and\r\nthe thirteen came from ten different dioceses. Several of them were, or\r\nhad been, Fellows of Merton; one, a Fellow of Exeter.\r\n\r\nIt was some years before the revenues of the College allowed of the\r\nmaintenance of so large a number of Fellows. The first “long roll”\r\npreserved mentions only five persons, including Eglesfield himself,\r\nas receiving a Fellow’s allowance; and eight is the largest number\r\nof Fellows named in any account up to the end of the century. In the\r\nearly part of the sixteenth century the numbers rose to about ten,\r\nbut dwindled again in the disturbed periods about the middle of the\r\ncentury. Twelve Fellows first appear in the Long Roll for 1590; and\r\nsoon after the number was increased to fourteen, at which the number of\r\nthe Fellows on the original foundation seems to have remained till the\r\nfirst of the two University Commissions of the present century.\r\n\r\nBy the ordinance of 1858, the number of Fellows of the Consolidated\r\nFoundation was fixed at nineteen; and by the statutes of 1877, the\r\nFellowships are to be not less in number than fourteen and not more\r\nthan sixteen. The actual number is fourteen.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times down to the legislation of 1858 the body of\r\nFellows seems to have been recruited from the junior members of the\r\nfoundation, and ordinarily by seniority.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have soon become a rule that no one should be admitted to a\r\nFellowship till he had proceeded to his Master’s degree. The University\r\nwas often appealed to to grant dispensations to Queen’s men to omit\r\nsome of the conditions generally required for that degree in order to\r\nenable them to be elected Fellows.\r\n\r\nIn 1579 some Bachelors were elected Fellows: “electi socii dum Domini\r\nfuere; sed irrita facta est electio: postea vero electi.”\r\n\r\nThe names given to the different orders of foundationers perhaps\r\ndeserve a passing notice. The Fellows, as we should call them,\r\nwere the “Scholares,” who, with the “Praepositus,” or Provost,\r\nconstituted the Corporation. They are in the original statutes called\r\nindifferently “Scholares” and “Socii.” The first name under which\r\nother recipients of Eglesfield’s bounty appear is that of “Pueri,”\r\nor “Pueri eleemosynarii.” By the end of the fourteenth century the\r\nname “Servientes” came to be applied to an intermediate order, between\r\nthe “socii” and the “pueri,” recruited from the latter. In 1407,\r\nfor instance, Bell is a “pauper puer”; in 1413 Ds. Walter Bell is a\r\n“serviens”; and in 1416 Mr. Walter Bell, who was for the previous\r\nMichaelmas Term, and for the first term of the year, still “serviens”\r\nand chaplain, becomes a Fellow. A candidate for the foundation seems\r\nto have entered the College as a “pauper puer”; to have become a\r\n“serviens” on taking his Bachelor’s degree; and to have been eligible\r\nto a Fellowship as soon as he had proceeded to the degree of M.A.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the three orders seems to have been maintained,\r\nthough with some variety in the names given to the orders and some\r\nlaxity in their application. Chaplains who are Masters are sometimes\r\nloosely called “pueri” even as early as the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; and about 1570 the term “servientes” seems to have gone out of\r\nuse and the name “pueri” to have been transferred to the Bachelors.\r\n\r\nSoon after this a fourth order appears intermediate between the first\r\nand second, of “magistri non-socii,” or Masters on the foundation. It\r\nmight often be convenient for a B.A. to proceed to his M.A. degree\r\nbefore a Fellowship was ready for him. The Chaplains were generally\r\nappointed from among these Masters. In the University Calendar of 1828\r\nthere appear as many as nine of these expectants.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the fifteenth century we find the lowest order called\r\n“pueri domus,” and then “pueri de taberta” or “taberto” or “tabarto.”\r\nThe first appearance of this famous appellation seems to be in the Long\r\nRoll for 1472. The tabard from which the Taberdars, as we now call\r\nthem, derived their name appears early in the accounts of the College.\r\nUnder the expenses of the boys in 1364-5 occurs:--“Item, cissori pro\r\ncota Ad. de Spersholt cum capic. tabard. et calig. xii d.”\r\n\r\nThe livery of the boys seems always to have been a special part of\r\nthe provision made by the College for them: 25_s._ 4_d._ is expended\r\nin 1407 “in vestura pauperum puerorum”; and when Thomas Eglesfield is\r\npromoted in 1416 from Leylonde Hall, where the College had paid 1_s._\r\n4_d._ for a term’s schooling for him to Mr. John Leylande and 5_d._ for\r\nhis batells, the first expenditure on his account as a poor boy of the\r\nCollege is “pro factura togae & tabard. ejusd. xii d.” Those who are\r\nwise in such matters may be able to calculate the size of the tabard\r\nfrom the datum that eight yards of cloth, at a cost of 14_s._ 8_d._,\r\nwere provided in 1437 “pro duobus pueris domus, pro tabard. suis.” In\r\n1503, 37_s._ 4_d._ is paid “pro liberatura iiij puerorum domus”; and in\r\n1519, 56_s._ for the same for six boys.\r\n\r\nThe College had probably its pattern for the tabard, but no trace of\r\na description of it has yet been discovered. The word seems, from\r\nDucange, to have been used for almost every sort of upper garment, from\r\nthe long tabard worn by the Priests of the Hospital of Elsingspittal\r\nwith tunic, supertunic and hood, to the round mantles or tabards\r\nof moderate length permitted by the council of Buda to be worn by\r\nPrelates, and the “renones,” or capes coming down to the reins, which\r\nthe French call “tabart.” It seems now to be only applied to the\r\nherald’s coat.\r\n\r\nThe four orders in their latest manifestation previous to the\r\nlegislation of 1858 were--1, Fellows; 2, Masters of Arts on the\r\nFoundation; 3, Taberdars or Bachelors of Arts on the Foundation; 4,\r\nProbationary Scholars, who were undergraduates. Under the subsequent\r\narrangements the name Taberdar has been reserved for the eight senior\r\nopen scholars.\r\n\r\nThe Provost was required by Eglesfield to be of mature character, in\r\nHoly Orders, a good manager, and he was to be elected for life. He was\r\nto be elected by the Fellows, and admit Fellows who had been elected;\r\nto devote himself to the rule and care of the College, and to the\r\nadministration of its property. He was to see to the collection of the\r\ndebts of the College, going to law if necessary on behalf of its rights\r\nand privileges, and to study in all respects to promote the advantage\r\nand enlargement of the Hall by obtaining such influence over Royal and\r\nother persons as he might be able to secure.\r\n\r\nThe provision that the Provost should be in Holy Orders seems only once\r\nto have been violated. Roger Whelpdale (1404), indeed, seems only to\r\nhave received priest’s orders after his election; but in the person\r\nof Thomas Francis all precedents were violated. He was a Doctor of\r\nMedicine, of Christ Church, a native of Chester, and Regius Professor\r\nof Medicine; and was in 1561, it would seem by Royal influence,\r\nintruded into the Provostship. Serious disturbances seem to have taken\r\nplace at his inauguration,[139] and in two years he had had enough\r\nof it. The irregularity prevailing at the time is evidenced by his\r\noffering in an extant letter to nominate Bernard Gilpin, the Apostle of\r\nthe North, as his successor.[140] The Tudor sovereigns seem in this,\r\nas in other matters, to have found it difficult to set limits to their\r\nprerogative. Later in Elizabeth’s reign, on Henry Robinson’s promotion\r\nfrom the Provostship to the Bishopric of Carlisle, his chancellor\r\nhad to write to the College, 8th Oct., 1598, signifying the Queen’s\r\npleasure that the election of a Provost in his room “be respited till\r\nher Majesty be informed whether it belongs to her by prerogative, or to\r\nthe Fellows, to chuse a successor.”\r\n\r\nNo fault can be found with the Provosts of the College, as a rule,\r\nfor want of care of its interests. The names of six occur in the\r\nThanksgiving for the Founder and Benefactors of the College; and others\r\ncould prefer a claim to the same distinction.\r\n\r\nThomas Langton (1487), the first of the six, who was also Fellow of\r\nPembroke Hall, Cambridge, where his “Anathema” cup is still to be seen,\r\ndied Bishop of Winchester, having been nominated just before his death\r\nto the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He left memorial legacies both\r\ndirectly to the College, and indirectly to it through a benefaction to\r\nGod’s House at Southampton. Christopher Bainbridge (1506), the next of\r\nthe Benefactor Provosts, was Cardinal and Archbishop of York, poisoned\r\nat Rome by his steward, and buried under a magnificent renaissance\r\nmonument which now adorns the Church of St. Thomas à Becket in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nA chantry priest was till the Reformation paid £5 6_s._ 8_d._ for\r\ncelebrating for the souls of these two benefactors in the Church of St.\r\nMichael in Bongate near Appleby, the capital of the county in which\r\nthey were both born.\r\n\r\nHenry Robinson (1581), the third on the list, had been Principal of\r\nSt. Edmund Hall, and died Bishop of Carlisle. His brass in Carlisle\r\nCathedral, of which the College possesses a duplicate, says of his\r\nrelations with the College, “invenit destructum, reliquit exstructum\r\net instructum.” The College spent, 15th July, 1615, £23 3_s._ 3_d._\r\nin celebrating his obsequies, and provided Chr. Potter with a funeral\r\ngown and hood to preach his funeral sermon; £10 was paid in 1617 for\r\nengraving his monument on copper, and 31_s._ 6_d._ for some impressions\r\nfrom the plate.\r\n\r\nHenry Airay (1598), who succeeds Robinson as Provost and Benefactor,\r\nthe Elisha to Robinson’s Elijah, as his brass with much variety of\r\nsymbolic illustration describes him, in spite of his being “a zealous\r\nCalvinist,” commends himself to Wood “for his holiness, integrity,\r\nlearning, grauity, and indefatigable pains in the discharge of his\r\nministerial functions.” The College proved his will at a cost of 41_s._\r\n8_d._, and spent £19 16_s._ 8_d._ on his funeral, 9th July, 1616.\r\n\r\nTimothy Halton (1677), the fifth of the Provosts commemorated in the\r\nThanksgiving, built the present spacious library of the College mainly\r\nat his own expense.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lancaster (1704), who is sixth, had the chief hand in building\r\nthe present College. He incurred Hearne’s wrath on private grounds\r\nand as a “Whigg,” and is abused by him through many volumes of his\r\nCollections; but he commended himself to others of his contemporaries,\r\nand the favour in which he was held by the Corporation of Oxford was\r\nof great service to the College. In the Mayoralty of Thomas Sellar,\r\nEsq., 14th Jan., 1709, it was “agreed that the Provost and Scholars\r\nof Queen’s College shall have a lease of so much ground in the high\r\nstreet leading to East Gate as shall be requisite for making their\r\nintended new building there strait and uniform from Michaelmas last for\r\none thousand years at a pepper corn rent, gratis and without fine, in\r\nrespect of the many civilities and kindnesses from time to time showed\r\nunto and conferred upon this city and the principal members thereof by\r\nDr. Lancaster.”\r\n\r\nIt was by thus obtaining influence over Royal and other persons,\r\nin conformity with the injunctions of the founder, that Provosts\r\nand other members of the College were enabled to benefit it. The\r\nmonument to Joseph Smith (1730) which faces one who comes out of the\r\nCollege chapel, seems to preserve the memory of an ideal Provost from\r\nEglesfield’s point of view and that which continued to be maintained\r\nin the College. “Distinguished for his Learning, Eloquence, Politeness\r\nof Manners, Piety and Charity, he with great Prudence and judicious\r\nModeration presided over his College to its general Happiness. Its\r\nInterests were the constant Object of his Attention. He was himself a\r\ngood Benefactor to it, and was blest with the Success of obtaining for\r\nit by his respectable Influence, several ample Donations to the very\r\ngreat and perpetual Increase of its Establishment.”\r\n\r\nAmong the “ample donations” obtained by Provost Smith’s “respectable\r\ninfluence,” the first place belongs to the Hastings foundation. The\r\nLady Elizabeth Hastings, daughter of Theophilus, seventh Earl of\r\nHuntingdon, of whom Steele says in the _Tatler_, “To love her is a\r\nliberal education,” bequeathed to the College in 1739 her Manors,\r\nLands, and Hereditaments in Wheldale in the West Riding of Yorkshire,\r\nto found five Exhibitions for five poor scholars that had been educated\r\nfor two years at one or other of twelve schools in Cumberland,\r\nWestmorland, and Yorkshire. Each school was to send a candidate, and\r\nthe candidates were first to be examined at Abberforth or Aberford in\r\nYorkshire by seven neighbouring clergymen, and the ten best exercises\r\nwere to be sent to the Provost and Fellows, who were to “choose out of\r\nthem eight of the best performances which appear the best, which done,\r\nthe names subscribed to those eight shall be fairly written, each in a\r\ndistinct paper, and the papers rolled up and put into an Urn or Vase,\r\n… and after being shaken well together in the Urn shall be drawn out\r\nof the same.… And those five whose names are first drawn shall to all\r\nIntents and Purposes be held duly elected.… And though this Method\r\nof choosing by Lot may be called by some Superstition or Enthusiasm,\r\nyet … the advice was given me by an Orthodox and Pious Prelate of the\r\nChurch of England as leaving something to Providence.” This method of\r\nelection was observed as late as 1859, the Urn or Vase then employed\r\nbeing the Provost’s man-servant’s hat. In 1769 the lot not drawn was\r\nthat of Edward Tatham of Heversham School, afterwards Rector of Lincoln\r\nCollege, probably the most notable person who was ever a candidate for\r\na place on this foundation. A more reasonable provision, that if of the\r\noriginal schools any should so far come to decay as to have no scholar\r\nreturned by the examiners at Aberford in four successive elections,\r\nthe College should appoint another school from the same county in its\r\nstead, has been of great benefit to the Foundation and to education in\r\nthe counties. The estate devised has increased in value, coals having\r\nbeen got, which were supposed in Lady Betty’s time to be in the estate.\r\nFourteen schools now enjoy the benefits of the Foundation, and nearly\r\nthirty Exhibitioners of £90 a year each now take the place of the\r\noriginal five Exhibitioners of £28 a year.\r\n\r\nElaborate regulations were laid down for the election of the Provost,\r\nand on one occasion at least the whole course of proceeding had to be\r\ngone through.[141] In the oath, which was to precede this as almost all\r\nother important ceremonies in the College, the Fellows swear that they\r\nwill elect the most fit and sufficient of the Fellows to the vacancy.\r\n\r\nDisputes have from time to time taken place as to whether a\r\n“promoted[142] Fellow” during his year of grace is to be regarded as a\r\nFellow for this purpose. At the time of Wm. Lancaster’s election (1704)\r\na pamphlet was published in opposition to his claims, but it would seem\r\nwithout any effect on the election. The pamphleteer has to allow that\r\nseveral earlier Provosts, among them Henry Boost, who was also Provost\r\nof Eton, and Bishop Langton, had never been Fellows at all.\r\n\r\nThe Provost was to receive five marks in addition to the portion\r\nassigned to each of the Fellows, and this was to be increased gradually\r\nto forty pounds in case the augmentation of the revenues of the College\r\nallowed the number of Fellows prescribed in the statutes to increase.\r\nHe was to receive this for his ordinary expenses and necessities. The\r\ncommunity was to defray any expenses incurred in absence on business,\r\nor in the entertainment of visitors who might repair to the College in\r\nconnection with its affairs.--In 1359-60, Adam, the Provost’s servant,\r\nhas his expenses paid for a visit to Southampton to see the condition\r\nof God’s House while the foreigners were at Winchester. In 1363-4 Henry\r\nWhitfield, the Provost, brings in a bill for his expenses on a voyage\r\nto the Court of Rome at Avignon on College business connected with the\r\nliving of Sparsholt in Berks. A century later the Provost is allowed\r\n5_s._ 10_d._ for his expenses to London in May 1519 to get money for\r\nthe building of the chapel. In 1600-1 18_d._ is paid for a horse sent\r\nto fetch the Provost for the election of a principal at St. Edmund Hall.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the College in the matter of the appointment of a\r\nPrincipal of that Hall have always been vigorously asserted against the\r\nChancellor of the University, who nominates the Principals of all other\r\npublic Halls. In 1636, when the Heads of Colleges and Halls were called\r\nupon to give their formal submission to Laud’s new statutes, Chr.\r\nPotter, Coll. Reginæ Præpositus, adds his name “Salvo jure Collegii\r\nprædicti ad Aulam St. Edmundi.” The record of the proceedings on the\r\noccasion of each election of a Principal has been preserved with a care\r\nnot usually extended to any but the most solemn of the proceedings of\r\nthe College. On the 18th December, 1614, Mr. French is paid 3_s._ for\r\nwriting out the agreement made between the University and the College\r\nabout the election of a Principal of St. Edmund Hall. The agreement,\r\nsecuring the appointment to the College, was made in 1559. Lord\r\nBuckhurst (Chancellor from 1591 to 1608) was advised by Lord Chief\r\nJustice Walmsley that it was void, but the law officers of the Crown at\r\nthe time maintained its validity.[143]\r\n\r\nThe common seal, the jewels, treasure, bulls, charters, writings,\r\nstatutes, privileges and muniments of the College were to be kept in\r\na chest with three locks, the keys whereof were to be kept by the\r\nProvost, the Treasurer, and the “Camerarius.” The two last were the\r\ntechnical names for the senior and junior Bursars respectively, and\r\nwere retained in the Long Rolls to a very recent time.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation was to be in theory open. Like the University, the\r\nCollege was not to close the bosom of its protection to any race or\r\ndeserving nation; and the Fellows at the time of election swore not\r\nonly to put away all hatred, fear, and partiality, and to listen to\r\nno requests, but also to act without accepting person or country. The\r\nconditions of eligibility were distinguished character, poverty and\r\nfitness for studying theology with profit. A preference, however,\r\nwas to be given to suitable persons who were natives of Cumberland\r\nand Westmorland, to which this preference was given on account of\r\ntheir waste state, their uninhabited condition, and the scarcity of\r\nletters in them. Within these limits too there was to be a preference\r\nfor founders’ kin. After these a _cæteris paribus_ preference was\r\ngiven to those places wherein the College derived benefit either from\r\necclesiastical benefices, manors, lands or tenements. These limitations\r\nsoon practically resulted in confining the Foundation to natives of\r\nthe two counties. They supplied a steady flow of capable persons; and\r\ncuriously enough, though so unequal in size and population, in about\r\nequal numbers.\r\n\r\nPressure was from time to time applied to the College to admit into the\r\nsociety persons not duly qualified. In the reign of James I., Robert\r\nMurray, a Scot, was thus recommended by a Royal letter; and, though the\r\nCollege declined to elect him, it was thought politic to pay him £20\r\n“ne in iniquam pecuniarum erogationem traheretur collegium.” During the\r\ntime of the usurpation, as a note in the Entrance Book calls it, four\r\nFellows were intruded, who were promptly got rid of at the Restoration\r\nof Charles II. Thomas Cartwright, who was afterwards “Tabiter,” and\r\neventually Bishop of Chester, and one of the Commissioners for ejecting\r\nthe President and Fellows of Magdalen College, is said to have been put\r\ninto the College by the Parliamentary Visitors during the same period.\r\n\r\nThe claim to preference as founder’s kin does not seem to have been\r\noften advanced. The Thomas Eglesfield, to the purchase of whose tabard\r\nreference is made above,[144] seems to have been grandson of the\r\nfounder’s brother John. At the time of his admission to the College,\r\nhis father, also called John, seems to have visited the College and\r\ntaken away with him a son William, who, like Thomas, had been for a\r\nterm under the instruction of Mr. John Leylonde. This is probably the\r\nWilliam who, with his wife, brother, and sister-in-law, receives from\r\nthe College gloves in 1459 to the value of 12½_d._ Leylonde seems to\r\nhave continued to act as private tutor to Thomas after he joined the\r\nCollege, as x_s._ is paid in 1418, “Magistro Joh. Leylonde pro scolagio\r\nTho. Egylsfelde.” A Christopher Eglesfield was on the Foundation about\r\nthe same time. Thomas went through all the stages of promotion. He was\r\n“puer,” “serviens,” Fellow, and eventually Provost, besides holding\r\nthe University offices of Proctor and Commissary (or Vice-Chancellor).\r\nAn Anthony Eglesfield was Fellow of the College in 1577. A James\r\nEglesfield belonged to it in 1615, and a George Eglesfield in 1670.\r\nA Gawin Eglesfield, who had been taberdar, and was passed over at an\r\nelection to Fellows in 1632, claimed election as founder’s kin, and was\r\nbacked by the Archbishop of York as visitor. The College successfully\r\nresisted the claim; but on Gawin’s acknowledgment that the claim was\r\nunfounded, to please the visitor, presented him to the living of Weston\r\nin Oxfordshire.\r\n\r\nThe College, however, in another way, has from the beginning “opened\r\nthe bosom of its protection” to students whom it was unwilling out of\r\nregard to the preferences of the founder to admit to the pecuniary\r\nbenefits of the Foundation. Whether it was that the buildings\r\ncontained more rooms than the slowly growing Foundation was able to\r\nfill with its own members, or for some other cause, the receipts of\r\nthe College have always included “pensiones” for “cameræ” occupied by\r\nnon-foundationers. The very first Long Roll which has been preserved,\r\nthat of 1347-8, contains the names of Roger Swynbrok, John Herte, and\r\nJohn Schipton as thus occupying chambers. The word used for the payment\r\nhas survived in “pensioners,” the name given at Cambridge to those whom\r\nwe call “commoners.” The pensioners of the fourteenth century probably\r\ndiffered in many respects from the commoners of the nineteenth. The\r\nfounder was in one sense the first commoner of the College. The Black\r\nPrince was perhaps one of the earliest. Dominus Nicholas monachus,\r\nthe monachus Eboracensis who paid two marks “pro magna camera,” the\r\nmonachus de Evesham, Robertus canonicus, The Prior of Derbich, Magister\r\nJohn Wicliff, Canonicus Randulphus, the Scriptor Slake, Bewforth, if\r\nnot Bewforth’s more celebrated pupil, afterwards Henry V., Raymund,\r\nRector of Hisley, the treasurer of Chichester, and numerous other\r\nMagistri whose names appear in this relation were probably rather\r\nresearchers or advanced students than anything more resembling the\r\nmodern undergraduate. It was not unusual for those who had been Fellows\r\nto return to the College after some period of absence from Oxford and\r\nfrom the Foundation. But it is doubtless in this element that we find\r\nthe first traces in the College of those who now occupy so prominent a\r\nplace in any view of modern Oxford. By the time the first lists occur\r\nof residents in the Colleges, and before the regularly-kept register of\r\nentrances begins, the present system seems to have been in full swing.\r\nIn course of time it became profitable for the College even to extend\r\nits buildings for the accommodation of this kind of student, and the\r\n“musaea” or “studies” in the “_novum cubiculum_” and in the “_novum\r\naedificium_” became a regular source of revenue.\r\n\r\nIt was not only through these and other payments that these “commoners”\r\ncontributed to the well-being of the College. Among its most liberal\r\nbenefactors some of the foremost have been non-foundationers. So John\r\nMichel, in some sense the second founder of the College, like his\r\nfather and his uncle, who, as he records, “in saeculo rebellionis\r\nnunquam satis deflendae sedem quietam per 14 annos hic invenerunt,” a\r\ncommoner of the College, besides other benefactions, left an endowment\r\nfor eight Fellows, four scholars, and four exhibitioners, merged by\r\nthe Commissioners of 1858 with the smaller Foundation of Sir Orlando\r\nBridgman, another commoner, in the original Foundation of Eglesfield.\r\nDuring the hundred years which this Foundation lasted (the first\r\nFellow was elected in 1764, the last in 1861) more than a hundred\r\nFellows elected to enjoy Michel’s liberality contributed an independent\r\nelement which somewhat modified the monotony of the old north-country\r\ncorporation. The Michel Fellows were not members of the governing body,\r\nand some amusing stories are told of the differences insisted on by\r\nsome of the less genial of the older order. Yet the “Michels” (_mali\r\ncatuli_, as the jesting etymology had it) contributed their full share\r\nto the glories of the College. A Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer,\r\na Chief Justice of Ceylon, a Bishop of St. David’s, three Bampton\r\nLecturers, a Bishop of Newfoundland, a Bishop of Ballarat, a Professor\r\nof Arabic,[145] were only the most prominent among a large number of\r\ndistinguished men who owed something to Michel’s liberality. The value\r\nof the Fellowships was small, and the length of tenure limited, and\r\nso richer Foundations carried off some of those who had for a while\r\nbeen on this Foundation. So among others Dornford passed in this way\r\nthrough Queen’s from Wadham to Oriel, so Basil Jones from Trinity to\r\nUniversity, so Tyler and Garbett back again to Oriel and Brasenose from\r\nwhich they came. The College has not been willing to let Michel’s name\r\nbe altogether forgot, and the four junior Fellows in the list are still\r\ncalled Michel Fellows.\r\n\r\nIn quite recent times the College has had to thank a commoner for its\r\nlatest considerable benefaction, and five scholars will always have\r\noccasion to bless the memory of Sir Edward Repps Jodrell.\r\n\r\nSome of the most characteristic of Eglesfield’s injunctions were\r\nconcerned with the Common Table. In the midst of the table was to sit\r\nthe Provost or his _locum tenens_. No one was to sit on the opposite\r\nside in any seat or chair, nor to eat on that side either kneeling or\r\nstanding. If necessary, room was to be found at a side table.\r\n\r\nThey were to meet twice in the day for meals at regular hours. They\r\nwere to be summoned by a “clarion” blown so as to be heard by all\r\nthe members of the foundation. Among the charges in the accounts for\r\n1452-3 is 2_s._ 4_d._ for the repair of the trumpet. In 1595-7, either\r\nfor repair or a new one, there was paid 8_s._ “pro tuba”; and in\r\n1604-5 “pro tuba et vectura a Lond. et emendatione,” 28_s._ In 1666 a\r\nmagnificent silver trumpet was presented by Sir Joseph Williamson, one\r\nof the most liberal of the benefactors as he was one of the most loyal\r\nof the sons of the College, to which he was never weary of expressing\r\nhis obligations and his affection. By a curious accident his extensive\r\nprivate correspondence has become incorporated with the Domestic State\r\nPapers of the period, and those who are searching for the more secret\r\nsprings of the public policy of his age have their attention arrested\r\nby the details of his familiar relations with his College friends. So\r\ntoo at an earlier time among the State Papers of the reign of James I.\r\nare included the Latin verses and orations, the sermon-notes and other\r\noccasional papers of a Queen’s undergraduate, who was afterwards to be\r\nMr. Secretary Nicholas. And along with these are letters to him from a\r\nsister, promising stockings, and asking sympathy for toothache and the\r\nmumps; and this three hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at table, before them was to be read the Bible by a\r\nChaplain. They were to pay attention to him, and not prevent his\r\nbeing heard by loquacity or shouting. They were to speak at table\r\n“modeste,” and in French or Latin unless in obedience to the law of\r\npoliteness to converse with a visitor in his own language, or for some\r\nother reasonable cause. Unseemly talk or jesting was to be avoided,\r\nand punished if necessary by the Provost. Up to the beginning of the\r\npresent century it was the practice for the porter to bring at the\r\nbeginning of dinner a Greek Testament to the Fellow presiding at the\r\nHigh Table who returned it to him indicating a verse, and saying,\r\n“Legat (so and so),” naming the scholar of the week. The porter then\r\ntook the book to the scholar and gave it him, saying, “Legat,” and the\r\nbook after the verse had been read was carried away by the porter.\r\nWhen this custom was abolished does not appear, but Provost Jackson\r\nremembered that it prevailed when he came into residence (1808).\r\n\r\nAt both meals, at all times of the year, that their garments might\r\nconform to the colour of the blood of the Lord, all the Fellows were to\r\nwear purple robes, and if Doctors of Theology or of Decrees, the robes\r\nwere to be furred with black budge. The Chaplains were to wear white\r\nrobes, and the Provost was to see that those of each grade wore robes\r\nof uniform colour.\r\n\r\nThe Students in Arts[146] among the poor boys were to dispute a\r\nsophism among themselves once or twice a week, under the guidance\r\nof an “artist,”[147] who was to look after them, superintend their\r\ndisputations, and otherwise supervise their instruction. The\r\n“grammarians”[148] were to have “collationes” before their instructor\r\nevery day except Sundays and “double feasts.” The Clerks of the Chapel\r\nwere to instruct the poor boys in singing. All the instructors,\r\nartists, grammarians and musicians were to be diligent in watching the\r\nprogress of the students and in instructing them, and were to swear to\r\nbe so.\r\n\r\nThe Students in Theology[149] were to hold theological disputations\r\nevery week on Saturday, Friday, or some other convenient day, which\r\nwere to be superintended by the Provost or his _locum tenens_, or the\r\nsenior present at the disputation; and at these all the theologians\r\nexcept the Provost, who would be very much busied about the affairs of\r\n“the Hall,” _i. e._ of the College, were bound to be present unless\r\nprevented by some lawful cause.\r\n\r\nThe number of scholars was to be increased as the means of the College\r\nallowed. A Provost or anybody else who opposed such increase was to be\r\nexpelled.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of each scholar a sum of ten marks annually was\r\nto be set aside. Of this, at least 1_s._ 6_d._, and not more than\r\n2_s._, was to be appropriated to his weekly commons. Anything saved\r\nunder this head out of 2_s._ in the week was to be devoted to alms\r\nand no other purpose. The remainder of the ten marks was to go to\r\nthe scholars to provide them with clothes and other necessaries. The\r\nProvost was to look to the character of the clothes. If they went far\r\nin country or town, they were not to wear simple or double “hoods,” but\r\nlong “collobia” (frocks, sleeveless or with short sleeves), or other\r\nsuitable garments; and they were not to go alone.\r\n\r\nAn absent Fellow was to forfeit his commons in the long vacation, and\r\nthe rest of his allowance also at other times, unless he were absent\r\non the business of the Hall. Additional reasons for the enjoyment of\r\ncommons in absence were subsequently approved. Pestilence in Oxford was\r\na common excuse. In 1400-1, 1_s._ 6_d._ is allowed for the commons of\r\nWilliam Warton and Peter de la Mare in time of pestilence. Similarly\r\nin 1625-6, £7 4_s._ is allowed to the Fellows dispersed in time of\r\npestilence. Equally urgent reasons commended themselves during the\r\nreign of Charles I. In 1642 payments are made to Fellows, Chaplains,\r\nboys and servants in place of commons, when the College was for seven\r\nweeks dissolved owing to the advance of the enemy; and this in the same\r\n“computus,” with seven payments for bonfires on the occasion of seven\r\nRoyalist victories. A Fellow received for each week 5_s._, a Chaplain\r\nand a boy 2_s._ 6_d._, a servant 2_s._ Three Fellows away in the North\r\ngot smaller payments during eleven months.\r\n\r\nIn order that there might be plenty to give away, the Scholars and\r\nChaplains were to have two courses at meals on ordinary days, and on\r\nthe five great feasts--Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, the Assumption,\r\nand All Saints Day--an extra course with a suitable quantity of wine.\r\nCourt manners were to be observed at meals and other times.\r\n\r\nHow soon the custom of bringing in a boar’s head at Christmas began\r\ndoes not appear, nor is the date of the carol sung on the occasion\r\nascertained. Wynkin de Worde’s version, which differs in some\r\nparticulars from that used in the College, was printed as early as\r\n1521. On the 24th December, 1660, £1 10_s._ is paid “pictori Hawkins\r\ncaput apri in festo nativitatis adornanti.” This suggests that the\r\nhead was then, as now, “adorned” with banners bearing coats of arms:\r\nRichard Hawkins was a heraldic painter resident in Oxford, an intimate\r\nof Anthony Wood.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of any Fellows sent out of Oxford on College business\r\nwere to be defrayed by the Community. They were to bring an account of\r\ntheir expenses at the end of the journey, which was to be audited by\r\nthe Provost, Treasurer, and Camerarius, who were to disallow them if\r\nin their judgment excessive; and if the three auditors could not agree\r\non this point, the judgment of the Provost was to decide. Thus, in\r\n1386-7, Mr. Richard Brown the Camerarius and Senior Fellow is repaid\r\n12_s._ 4_d._, his expenses for a journey to Devonshire to get the books\r\nbequeathed to the College by Mr. Henry Whitfield, as well as 20_d._ for\r\nthe carriage of the said books. Ten years later two and a half marks\r\nare paid for Mr. Thomas Burton’s expenses in going to the Archbishop of\r\nYork. In 1411-12 the same Fellow pays a visit on College business to\r\nthe Roman court.\r\n\r\nIf the revenues of the College allowed, thrice in the year, at the\r\nend of each term, a portion beyond the commons was to be divided\r\namong the Fellows fairly, according to the amount of their residence.\r\nOn the day of this division the statutes of the College were to be\r\nread among themselves by the Provost and scholars, and a solemn mass\r\nof the Holy Trinity to be said in the College Chapel, or Parochial\r\nChurch, “if they got one,” for the King, Queen Philippa, the other\r\nbenefactors of the Hall, and other persons specified in the statutes,\r\nand for all the faithful living and dead. After the solemn mass the\r\nProvost was to inquire separately of each of the Fellows as to the\r\nbehaviour of the rest in the matters of obedience to the statutes,\r\nhonesty of deportment, and progress in study. Special regulations were\r\nlaid down for the conduct of this inquiry. These regularly recurring\r\ninquiries might be supplemented by special inquiries whenever the\r\nProvost thought it necessary; and at the peril of his soul he was to\r\nsee that the boys, the chaplains, and the other “_ministri_” conducted\r\nthemselves properly. All accused persons were to be allowed to purge\r\nthemselves privately, peacefully, and honestly, but not scandalously\r\nor contentiously. No scholar or poor boy was to be expelled except\r\nwith consent of a majority of the College. The Provost inflicted other\r\npunishments after taking counsel with one or two of the scholars.\r\n\r\nThe Provost was allowed to keep a servant or clerk, to whose\r\nmaintenance he was to contribute. The other Masters or scholars\r\nwere prohibited from burdening the community by the introduction of\r\nstrangers or relatives, and especially of poor clerks of their own or\r\nprivate servants. This was not to prevent hospitality being shown at\r\nthe expense of the entertainer, in the hall or in his own chamber, to\r\nfriends, of any rank, from the city or outside, who might come to see\r\none of the community. A visitor on business of the community was to be\r\nproperly entertained in the hall or Provost’s lodging at the common\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nNor did this in later times prevent such services as were rendered by\r\na “fag” at a public school some fifty years ago from being rendered in\r\nCollege for a salary by the poorer students to the richer. So George\r\nFothergill, in 1723, writes home--“My Tutor has given me a gentleman\r\ncommoner last night, w^{ch} I call’d up this morning. So that for\r\ncalling up I have about 5 pounds per year, viz. 5_s._ a quarter of each\r\nof the 3 com̄oners w^{ch} I had before, w^{ch} comes to 3 pounds a\r\nyear, & 10_s._ a quarter for this Gent: Com: w^{ch} makes up 5 pounds.”\r\n\r\nHarriers, hounds, hawks, and other such animals were not to be kept in\r\nthe Hall or its precincts by any of the scholars. It was not thought\r\nfitting that poor men living mainly on alms should give the bread of\r\nthe sons of men for the dogs to eat, and woe to those who play among\r\nthe birds of the air. The “_extructio pullophylacii_” in 1590 would\r\nprobably not be regarded as a violation of the statute, nor “_le\r\nhenhouse_,” probably the same building which is referred to a few years\r\nlater. A caged eagle also seems from time to time to have been kept\r\nin the College, in connection with the founder’s name and the arms of\r\nthe College. In 1661, 5_s._ 3_d._ is paid, “_operculum fabricanti ad\r\nconcludendam aquilam domini praepositi_.”\r\n\r\nThe use of musical instruments was prohibited within the College except\r\nduring the hours of general refreshment, as likely to produce levity\r\nand insolence, and to afford occasion of distraction from study.\r\nThis of course did not apply to the musical instruments employed in\r\nthe chapel service. There was an organ in chapel from very early\r\ntimes. In 1436-7 4_d._ is paid among the expenses of the chapel “pro\r\nemendatione organorum”; and in 1490-1 “organa reparantur.” In 1676-7\r\n£1 12_s._ is paid “famulis domini episcopi Londinensis organum musicum\r\nafferentibus.” This was Bishop Compton, who crowned William III.,\r\nand who had been a gentleman commoner of the College. The present\r\norgan, perhaps the largest in Oxford, is mainly due to the skill and\r\nliberality of Leighton George Hayne, D.Mus., and sometime Coryphæus of\r\nthe University, who, with the support of the late Archbishop of York,\r\nrevived the musical service which had for many years been interrupted.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of games of dice, chess, and others giving opportunity of\r\nlosing money, were prohibited, especially dice and other similar games\r\nwhich give occasion for strife and often beggary to the player. An\r\nexception was made for such games occasionally played, not in the hall,\r\nfor recreation only, when it did not interfere with study or divine\r\nservice. All Chaplains, poor clerks, servants, and other inhabitants of\r\nthe Hall were bound by this prohibition, and the Provost or his _locum\r\ntenens_ were bound on pain of perjury to inflict the penalties which\r\nmight be necessary to stop these or other infractions of the statutes.\r\nWhen stage plays came into vogue the College followed the fashion. In\r\nthe accounts of 1572-3, 3_s._ 8_d._ is paid “pro fabricatione scenae\r\nin aula ad tragicam comoediam narrandam,” and 7_s._ 5_d._ “in expensis\r\ntragicae comediae in natal. Xti.”\r\n\r\nThe chambers and studies were to be assigned to the scholars by the\r\nProvost, who was to assign, except for special reasons, according to\r\nseniority. There were to be at least two in each chamber unless the\r\nstatus or pre-eminence of the quality of any of the scholars should\r\nrequire otherwise. The arrangement of rooms adopted in the front\r\nquadrangle when the College was rebuilt seems to retain a trace of the\r\nold regulations. A large “chamber” with two “studies” recalls the days\r\nwhen John Boast and Henry Ewbank were chamber-fellows or “chums” in\r\ntheir youth, before the dark time when the younger man was the cause of\r\nthe elder being butchered alive for exercising his priestly functions\r\nin England.[150] Nowadays in the rare case of two brothers or intimate\r\nfriends living together in a set of rooms, the old disposition is\r\nreversed, the chamber becomes the joint study, and the two studies the\r\nseparate bed-chambers.\r\n\r\nExcept for urgent cause, or by leave of the Provost or his _locum\r\ntenens_, the scholars were not to have meals except in the hall,\r\nand they were to avoid, in accordance with the laws of temperance,\r\nexpensive and luxurious meals of all kinds, suppers and other eatings\r\nand drinkings. The Provost or his _locum tenens_ was to restrain all\r\nsuch excess.\r\n\r\nThe scholars were not to pass the night outside the College in the\r\ntown or its suburbs unless leave had been previously obtained from the\r\nProvost, his _locum tenens_, or the senior in hall; and the application\r\nfor leave must specify the cause for which such leave is asked.\r\n\r\nA Fellow, poor cleric, or Chaplain expelled was not to have any remedy\r\nagainst the College by law or otherwise, and was to renounce any\r\nright to such remedy under the obligation of an oath at the time of\r\nhis admission to the Hall. The College sometimes showed compassion to\r\nformer Fellows who fell into misfortune: 28th September, 1625, 50_s._\r\nis paid to Mr. Lancaster formerly a Fellow, now reduced to the depths\r\nof misery, and in following years a similar payment is made, the amount\r\nbeing raised later to £4.\r\n\r\nA scholar was to forfeit his emolument by entering religion, by\r\ntransferring himself to anybody’s obedience, by being absent except on\r\nCollege business or by special leave of the Provost for more than the\r\ngreater half of a full term, or for wilfully neglecting to take the\r\nprescribed steps of advancement in study.\r\n\r\nOffences generally were to be tried by the Provost and two assessors,\r\nand punished by the Provost with the consent of the scholars.\r\n\r\nThe College was to bake its own bread and brew its own beer within\r\nthe College, by its own servants acting under the supervision of the\r\nsteward of the week and of the treasurer’s clerk. Every loaf before it\r\nwas baked was to weigh 46_s._ 8_d._ sterling, from whatever market the\r\ncorn came, and of whatever kind the bread was; and this weight was not\r\nto be changed whatever was the price of corn.\r\n\r\nA sum of £40 specially given for this purpose by the founder was always\r\nto remain in hand, to be set apart at the beginning of each year, and\r\naccounted for at the end as ready-money or floating balance, to be used\r\nfor buying stores of victuals and fuel, and not to be employed in part\r\nor whole for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Scholars were to have a horse-mill of their own to grind their\r\nwheat, barley, and other corn within the College, or at least very near\r\nthereto, to save the excessive tolls and payments to millers which\r\nmight otherwise fall upon them.\r\n\r\nWith these and similar injunctions the founder launched the College on\r\nits voyage across the centuries. Into the details of that voyage there\r\nis no further room to go. Whatever affected the history of the country\r\naffected the history of the University, and whatever affected the\r\nhistory of the University affected the history of the College. Wycliff\r\nstayed within the College, and Nicholas of Hereford, who translated\r\nfor him the Old Testament, was a Fellow. Henry Whitfield, Provost, and\r\nthree Fellows, one of them John of Trevisa, all four west-countrymen,\r\nwere expelled for Wycliffism. The phases of the Reformation in England\r\nare accurately reflected in the College accounts. A Royal Commission\r\nvisits the College in 1545, and Rudd, one of the Fellows, is expelled.\r\nEightpence is paid, “pro vino & orengis commissionariis.” Three years\r\nlater 6_s._ 2_d._ is paid, “dolantibus meremium & diripientibus\r\nimagines in sacello.” The wheel comes round, and in 1555, 9_s._\r\nis paid, “pro ligatione et coopertura unius portiphorii, duorum\r\nprocessionalium, unius missalis, unius gradalis, unius antiphonarii\r\n& unius hymnarii.” But the reaction is only temporary, and in 1560\r\nappears 4_s._ 8_d._, “pro destruendo altaria.”\r\n\r\nThe College contributes others besides the Wycliffites and Rudd as\r\nvictims to the struggles of the times. John Bost is a martyr for\r\nRoman Catholicism; as Michael Hudson later, for the King against the\r\nParliament. Thomas Smith’s case is the hardest of all; as, having been\r\nturned out of his Fellowship at Magdalen for refusing to elect Bishop\r\nParker as President, he is turned out again later on for refusing to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance to William III.\r\n\r\nThe College shared the fortunes of the University in the days of the\r\nStuarts. His Majesty desires the College, 5th Jan., 1642-3, to lend him\r\nall plate of what kind soever belonging to the College, and promises\r\nto see the same repaid after the rate of 5_s._ per ounce for white,\r\nand 5_s._ 6_d._ for gilt plate; and nine days later Mr. Stannix,\r\nthesaurarius, delivers to Sir William Parkhurst for his Majesty’s use\r\nsuch a collection of tankards, two-eared potts, white large bowles\r\nand lesser bowles, salts and gilt bowles, and spoones and gobletts,\r\nas the College shall never see again, 2319 oz. of both sorts, worth\r\nin all £591 1_s._ 9_d._ And then the Provost and scholars, as things\r\ngrow worse, petition Sir Thomas Glemham that--whereas parcel of the\r\nworks on the west side of Northgate had been assigned to Magdalen and\r\nQueen’s College jointly, and Queen’s College had already performed\r\nmore than in a due proportion would have come to their share, most of\r\nthem labouring in their own persons by the space of twelve days at\r\nthe least, while those of Magdalen assisted, some very slenderly and\r\nsome not at all--that a proportionable part of the work yet unfinish’d\r\nmay be set forth to themselves in particular apart from Magdalen;\r\nand this is ordered to be done. And then the king goes down, and the\r\nparliamentary visitors appear; and “This is the answer of mee, Jo.\r\nFisher (Master of Arts and Chaplaine of Queenes Colledge), and which\r\nI shall acknowledge is myne: That I cannot without perjury submitt\r\nto this visitation, and therefore I will not submitt. _Ita est_: Jo.\r\nFisher.” And John Fisher and others are reported to the Committee of\r\nLords and Commons and lose their places. And George Phillip and James\r\nBedford and William Barksdale and Moses Foxcraft appear in the Register\r\nof Fellows as “Intrusi tempore usurpationis, exclusi ad Restaurationem\r\nCaroli Secundi.”\r\n\r\nAnd in all these crises, and those which have followed, “sons of\r\nEglesfield” have been called to play their part. Thomas Barlow, Bishop\r\nof Lincoln; Henry Compton, Bishop of London; Thomas Cartwright, Bishop\r\nof Chester; Thomas Lamplugh, Archbishop of York; Edmund Gibson, Bishop\r\nof London; William Nicholson, Archbishop of Cashel; Thomas Tanner,\r\nBishop of St. Asaph; William Van Mildert, Bishop of Durham; William\r\nThomson, Archbishop of York, among Prelates: John Owen, Dean of\r\nChrist Church; John Mill and Richard Cecil, among Divines: Sir John\r\nDavies, Sir Thomas Overbury, William Wycherly, Joseph Addison, Thomas\r\nTickell, William Collins, William Mitford, Jeremy Bentham, Francis\r\nJeffrey, among men of letters: Gerard Langbaine, Thomas Hyde, Thomas\r\nHudson, Edward Thwaites, Christopher Rawlinson, Edward Rowe Mores,\r\nThomas Tyrwhitt, among scholars; Edmund Halley and Henry Highton,\r\namong men of science; Sir Edward Nicholas, Sir John Banks, and Sir\r\nJoseph Williamson, among lawyers and statesmen--are but a selection\r\nof the more distinguished of those to whose equipment the College has\r\ncontributed in a greater or less degree. May those who now and shall\r\nhereafter occupy their places avoid their errors and emulate their\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nNEW COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. HASTINGS RASHDALL, M.A., LATE SCHOLAR OF NEW COLLEGE,\r\nFELLOW OF HERTFORD COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n    [A MS. life of Wykeham ascribed to Warden Chaundler, but\r\n    probably only corrected by him, remains in the possession\r\n    of the College. The _Historica Descriptio complectens vitam\r\n    ac res gestas Wicami_, Londini 1597, is the work of Martyn.\r\n    There are two scholarly lives of the Founder by Lowth (edit.\r\n    2, London 1759) and G. H. Moberly (Winchester 1887), but they\r\n    give little information about the College. Walcott’s _William\r\n    of Wykeham and his Colleges_ (Winchester 1852) is the fullest\r\n    College history that we possess, but it leaves something to be\r\n    desired. I have to thank the Warden of New College, the Rev.\r\n    W. A. Spooner, and the Rev. H. B. George for several valuable\r\n    suggestions or corrections.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMore has been written about the lives of the Oxford College founders\r\nthan about the institutions which they founded. In some cases the\r\nlife of a founder properly belongs to the history of his College; the\r\nlife of William of Wykeham is part of the history of England. For our\r\npresent purpose, therefore, it is unnecessary to trace his public\r\nand political career; but we cannot appreciate the aim of such an\r\ninstitution as New College without understanding the kind of man in\r\nwhose brain the scheme originated.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Wykeham was an ecclesiastic; but in the Middle Ages that\r\nmeant something very different from what it means now. “The Church” was\r\na synonym for “the professions.” In Northern Europe the Church supplied\r\nalmost the only opportunity of a civil career to the cadet of a noble\r\nhouse, the sole opportunity of rising to the ambitious plebeian. The\r\nservants of the Crown, the diplomatists, the secretaries, advisers,\r\nor “clerks” of great nobles, the host of ecclesiastical judges and\r\nlawyers, many even of the secular lawyers, the physicians, the\r\narchitects, sometimes even the astrologers, were ecclesiastics. William\r\nof Wykeham rose to eminence as a civil servant of the Crown, and was\r\nrewarded in the usual way by ecclesiastical preferment, culminating\r\nin a bishopric. Such men had usually taken a degree in Canon or Civil\r\nLaw at the Universities. William of Wykeham is not known to have been\r\na University man; he rose to eminence in the King’s Office of Works,\r\nand became surveyor at Windsor Castle, which was half rebuilt under\r\nhis direction. He was the greatest architect of his day. Afterwards he\r\nheld a series of political appointments--eventually the Chancellorship.\r\nAs a politician, he was the champion of the old order of things rudely\r\nshaken by the Wycliffite heresy and the political movements with which\r\nit was associated; the leader of the Church, or Conservative, party;\r\na moderate and far-sighted man withal, but still a sturdy opponent of\r\nreform; a pious man in the conventional fourteenth-century way, but\r\nstill a devoted supporter of all the abuses against which Wyclif had\r\ndeclaimed, as became one who was himself the greatest pluralist of his\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNew College was intended to be another stronghold of the old system in\r\nChurch and State. It was to increase the supply of clergy, which the\r\nstatutes declare to have been thinned by “pestilences, wars, and the\r\nother miseries of the world.” Some have seen in these words a special\r\nallusion to the Black Death of 1348; but it was more probably a mere\r\nflourish of mediæval rhetoric, or possibly a fashion which had survived\r\nfrom 1348. The general idea of the College was not fundamentally\r\ndifferent from that of its predecessors. William of Wykeham, once\r\nraised to the splendid See of Winchester, was anxious to do something\r\nfor the Church; and the general opinion of the day was that monks were\r\nout of date, that the Church herself was rich enough, and that to send\r\ncapable men to the Universities was the best way to fight heresy, to\r\nstrengthen the Church system, and to save the donor’s soul.\r\n\r\nWykeham’s ultimate purpose in founding his College was conventional\r\nenough; in the manner of carrying it out there was much that was\r\noriginal. It was, however, rather the greater scale of the whole design\r\nthan any one original feature that gives an historical appropriateness\r\nto the name “New” which has accidentally cleaved to “St. Marie\r\nColledge of Wynchester” in Oxford. In the number of the scholars, in\r\nthe liberality of their allowances, in the architectural splendour of\r\nthe buildings of his College, Wykeham eclipsed all previous Oxford\r\nCollege-founders. In many respects the founder of Queen’s had, indeed,\r\naimed as high as Wykeham; but he had begun to build and was not able\r\nto finish; his Provost and apostolic twelve never grew to the seventy\r\nwhich he contemplated. What Eglesfield designed, Wykeham accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe most original feature of Wykeham’s design was the connection of his\r\nCollege at Oxford with a grammar-school at a distance. The fundamental\r\nvice of mediæval education was the prevalent neglect of grammatical\r\ndiscipline and the absurdly early age at which boys were plunged into\r\nthe subtleties of Logic and the mysteries of the Latin Aristotle,\r\nthe very language of which, unclassical as it was, they could hardly\r\nunderstand. Wykeham had no thought of a Renaissance, or of any\r\nfundamental change in the educational system of the day; he was only\r\nanxious to remedy a defect which all practical men acknowledged. Boys\r\nwere still to be taught Latin chiefly that they might read Aristotle,\r\nand Peter the Lombard or the Corpus Juris; but they were to learn to\r\nwalk before they were encouraged to run.\r\n\r\nHard by his own cathedral, the Bishop erected a College for a Warden,\r\nSub-Warden, ten Fellows, a Head Master, Usher, and seventy scholars,\r\nwith a proper staff of chaplains and choristers. From this College\r\nexclusively were to be selected the seventy scholars of St. Marie\r\nColledge of Wynchester in Oxford; and no one could be elected before\r\nfifteen or after nineteen, except in the case of “Founder’s-kin”\r\nscholars, who were eligible up to thirty. This implies that the usual\r\nage of Wykehamists upon entering the University would be much above\r\nthe average, since it was quite common for boys to begin their course\r\nin Arts at fourteen or earlier. By the erection of his College at\r\nWinchester, Wykeham became the founder of the English public-school\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford College consisted of a Warden and seventy “poor clerical\r\nscholars,” together with ten “stipendiary priests” or chaplains, three\r\nstipendiary clerks, and sixteen boy-choristers for the service of the\r\nchapel. It entered on a definite existence not later than 1375, the\r\nscholars being temporarily lodged in Hart Hall (now Hertford College)\r\nand other adjoining houses while the buildings were being completed.\r\nThe foundation charters were granted in 1379; the foundation-stone\r\nlaid at 8 a.m. on March 5th, 1379-80; on April 14th, 1387, at 9 a.m.\r\nthe society, “with cross erect, and singing a solemn litany,” marched\r\nprocessionally into the splendid habitation which their Founder had\r\nbeen preparing for them in an unoccupied corner within the walls of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nNew College is the first, and still almost the only, College whose\r\nextant buildings substantially represent a complete and harmonious\r\ndesign as it presented itself to the founder’s eye. The quadrangle\r\nof New College may indeed have been the first completed quadrangle\r\nin Oxford. In that case we might attribute to the architect Bishop\r\nthe origination of the type to which later English Colleges have so\r\ntenaciously adhered. At any rate completeness is the characteristic\r\nfeature of Wykeham’s buildings; every want of his scholars was provided\r\nfor from their academical birth, if need be to the grave.\r\n\r\nPrevious Colleges had for the most part occupied the choir of some\r\nexisting parish church for the solemn services of Sunday and Holy-day;\r\nat most they had a little “oratory” in which a priest or two said\r\nmass. With Wykeham the chapel formed an integral part of the original\r\ndesign. In spite of the ravages of Puritan iconoclasm, the chapel\r\nhas always retained the perfect proportion which it received from\r\nits founder’s hands. It is now regaining, under the touch of modern\r\nrestoration, so much of its ancient beauty as the cold taste of the\r\npresent day will tolerate; but we shall never see again the blaze of\r\ncolour on windows and walls, on groined roof and on sculptured image\r\nwhich it presented to its founder’s eye. Wykeham’s design provided\r\nnot merely for things needful, but for ornament. Not only was the\r\nchapel a choir of cathedral magnitude, with transepts, though without\r\na nave--henceforth the typical form of the College chapel; there was\r\noutside the wall (nowhere else could it have stood so conveniently),\r\nthe great Bell-tower. There was an ample hall or refectory, the\r\noldest now remaining in Oxford. There were cloisters, round which\r\nevery Sunday the whole College, in copes and surplices, were to go in\r\nprocession, “according to the use of Sarum,” and within which members\r\nof the College might be buried, by special papal bull, without leave\r\nof parish-priest or bishop. There was a tower specially provided over\r\nthe hall staircase with massive doors of many locks to serve as a\r\nmuniment-room and treasury. There was a library, stored with books by\r\nthe founder; and an audit-room on the north side of the east gate.\r\nJust outside the main entrance were the brewery and the bake-house.\r\nA spacious garden supplied the College with vegetables, and perhaps\r\nthe scholars with room for such exercise as was permitted by the\r\nhigh standard of “clerical” behaviour demanded of Wykeham’s tonsured\r\nundergraduates. And all remains now substantially as the founder\r\ndesigned it, marred only by the addition (in 1675) of a third story to\r\nthe front quadrangle, and by the modernization of the windows.\r\n\r\nThe religious aim of College-founders is often exaggerated, or at\r\nleast misapprehended. It is true that all Oxford Colleges, like the\r\nUniversity itself, were intended for ecclesiastics. But in the earlier\r\nColleges not even the Head is required to be in Holy, or even in\r\nminor, Orders; nor are students of any rank required to go to church\r\nor chapel except on Sundays and holy-days. As time went on, the\r\necclesiastical character of Colleges is more and more emphasized; but\r\neven then, more is thought of providing for the repose of the founder’s\r\nsoul than of the moral or religious training of his scholars, or the\r\nspiritual wants of those to whom they were to minister. Colleges, like\r\nmonasteries, were largely endowed out of the “impropriated” tithes\r\nproperly belonging to the parochial churches. But if College Fellows\r\nare required to become priests at a certain stage of their career,\r\nit is that they may say masses for the founder. If the chapels are\r\nprovided with a staff of chaplains, it is with the same object. In\r\nWilliam of Wykeham’s College the ecclesiastical character is at its\r\nmaximum: Wykeham aimed in fact at erecting a great Collegiate Church\r\nand an Academical College in one. The ecclesiastical duties--the masses\r\nand canonical hours--were chiefly performed by the hired chaplains.\r\nBut even the studious part of the community was required to make some\r\nreturn for the founder’s liberality by saying certain prayers for him\r\nand his royal “benefactors” immediately after rising and before going\r\nto bed. They are further required to go to mass daily--it is the first\r\nOxford College where daily chapel is required--and while there (or\r\nat some other time) every scholar is to say sixty _Paters_ and fifty\r\n_Aves_ in honour of the Virgin.\r\n\r\nWykeham was indeed the first College-founder, at Oxford at all events,\r\nwho conceived the idea of making his College not a mere eleemosynary\r\ninstitution, but a great ecclesiastical corporation, which should\r\nvie both in the splendour of its architecture and the dignity of its\r\ncorporate life with the Cathedral chapters and the monastic houses.\r\nThe earlier Heads had been raised above the scholars or Fellows by\r\nthe luxury of a single private room: they dined in the common hall\r\nwith the rest. The Warden of New College was to live, like an abbot,\r\nin a house of his own, within the College walls, but with a separate\r\nhall, kitchen, and establishment. His salary of £40 was princely by\r\ncomparison with the 40_s._, with commons, assigned to the Master of\r\nBalliol, or even the forty marks allotted to the Warden of Merton.\r\nInstead of the jealous provisions against burdening the College\r\nwith the entertainment of guests which we meet with in the Paris\r\nCollege-statutes, ample provision is made for the hospitable reception\r\nof important strangers by the Warden in his own Hall, or (in his\r\nabsence) by the Sub-Warden and Fellows in the Great Hall, as they would\r\nhave been entertained in a Benedictine abbey by the abbot or the prior\r\n(the Sub-Warden being evidently intended to hold a position analogous\r\nto the latter). The Master of Peterhouse in Cambridge was allowed to\r\nhave a single horse, on the ground that it would be “indecent for\r\nhim to go afoot, nor could he, without scandal to the College, hire\r\na hack” (_conducere hakenys_): the Warden of New College is to have\r\n_six_ horses at his disposal, for himself and the “discreet, apt, and\r\ncircumspect Fellow,” with four servants, who attended upon the annual\r\n“progress” over the College estates--more than some provincial canons\r\nallowed to a cathedral dean. In chapel the Warden was placed on a level\r\nwith cathedral canons by the permission to wear an amice _de grisio_\r\n(vair or ermine).\r\n\r\nThe “commons,” or weekly allowance of a Fellow, was to be a shilling\r\nin times of plenty, which might rise in times of scarcity to 16_d._,\r\nor when the bushel of corn should be at 2_s._, to 18_d._ But though\r\nthe College allowances were equal, the money was expended by the\r\nofficers for the Fellows, and not by the Fellows themselves; and it was\r\nexpressly provided that the quality of the victuals supplied should\r\nvary with “degree, merit and labour.” The Sub-Warden and Doctors of\r\nsuperior Faculties sat at the High Table, to which also might be\r\nadmitted Bachelors of Theology in defect of sufficient Doctors; their\r\nplates or courses (_fercula_) might not exceed four. But when the\r\nWarden dined in Hall (which he was only privileged to do on certain\r\ngreat festivals), he was to sit in the middle of the table and to\r\nbe “served alone,” _i. e._ to have luxuries provided for him in\r\nwhich his neighbours were not to participate. At the side-tables sat\r\nthe Graduate-Fellows and chaplains; in the middle of the Hall, the\r\nprobationers and other juniors. During meals the Bible was read, and\r\nsilence required. As to the hours of meals it may be observed (though\r\nthe statutes are silent on this head) that the usual hour for dinner\r\nwas 10 a.m., and supper was at 5 p.m. There is no trace of breakfast in\r\nany mediæval College till near the beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen it became usual for men to go to the buttery for a hunk of bread\r\nand a pot of beer, which were either consumed at the buttery or taken\r\naway--the first meal taken in rooms, and the origin of that tradition\r\nof breakfast-parties which is still characteristic of University life.\r\nBut when it is remembered that the day began at five or six, it were a\r\npious opinion that some kind of “hasty snack” at an early hour (such as\r\nthe _jentaculum_ of a later day) was winked at in the case of weaker\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nBesides the commons every Fellow received an annual “livery,” or suit\r\nof clothes, suitable to his University rank, but also of uniform cut\r\nand colour; and the rooms were no doubt rudely furnished at the expense\r\nof the College.\r\n\r\nA Fellow received no other allowance, unless he was of Founder’s-kin\r\nand poor, or a priest, or an officer, or a tutor, the latter receiving\r\n5_s._ a year for each pupil. A Fellow in need of such assistance might\r\nalso have the heavy expenses of graduation, especially of banqueting\r\nthe Regents, defrayed by the College.\r\n\r\nIn the lower rooms, each of which had four windows and four studies\r\n(_studiorum loca_), four scholars were quartered; in the upper rooms,\r\nthree. The chaplains and clerks slept in rooms under the Hall, which\r\nare now appropriated to the College stores. A senior was placed in\r\neach room who was responsible for the diligence and good conduct of\r\nthe juniors, and was bound to report irregularities to the Warden,\r\nSub-Warden, or Dean, “so that such manner of Fellows and scholars\r\nsuffering defect in their morals, negligent, or slothful in their\r\nstudies, may receive competent castigation, correction, and punition.”\r\nWhether the last terrors of scholastic law are contemplated under the\r\nhead of “castigation” is not quite clear; but Fellows of all ranks were\r\nliable to “subtraction of commons”; and were in that case, perhaps, not\r\nable to live upon their neighbours in the convenient manner practised\r\nby modern New College men “crossed at the buttery.”\r\n\r\nOnly a Doctor might have a separate servant; but all were required to\r\nhave separate beds, a luxury not altogether a matter of course in the\r\nMiddle Ages. At Magdalen, for instance, the younger Demies slept two in\r\na bed.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of service were to be performed by males; though a\r\nwasherwoman might be tolerated (“in defect of a male washer”),\r\nprovided she were of such “age and condition” as to be above “sinister\r\nsuspicions.” One of the servants was to be specially entrusted with the\r\ntask of carrying the scholars’ books to the public schools.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of New College are extraordinarily minute and detailed in\r\ntheir disciplinary regulations, being more than three times as long\r\nas those of Merton. In their ample prohibitory code we may probably\r\nsee a fair picture of undergraduate life in the Middle Ages, as it\r\nwas outside the Colleges. It was the Colleges which gradually broke\r\ndown the ancient liberty of the boy-undergraduate; and at last, by the\r\nsixteenth century, succeeded in making him a mere school-boy _sub virga\r\net ferula_.\r\n\r\nOne piece of rough mediæval horse-play which incurs the founder’s\r\nespecial wrath is that “most vile and horrid sport of shaving beards,\r\nwhich is wont to take place on the night preceding the inception of\r\nMasters of Arts.” Among the more ordinary pastimes forbidden by the\r\nfounder are the haunting of taverns and “spectacles,” the keeping of\r\ndogs, hawks, or ferrets; the games of chess, hazard, or ball; and other\r\n“noxious, inordinate, or illicit” games, “especially those played for\r\nmoney”; shooting with “arrows, stones, earth, or other missiles” to the\r\ndanger of windows and buildings; the “effusion of wine, beer, or other\r\nliquor” (some unpleasant details are added under this head) upon the\r\nfloor of upper chambers; “dancing or wrestling or other incautious or\r\ninordinate games” in the hall or “perchance in the chapel itself,” the\r\nreason alleged for this last prohibition being that danger might be\r\ndone to the sculptured “image of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,” and\r\nother ornaments on the wall between the chapel and the hall. After this\r\ncomprehensive list of unlawful amusements, the reader may be inclined\r\nto ask, “What recreations did the good bishop allow his scholars?”\r\nOnly one seems contemplated by the statutes: the founder’s experience\r\nof human nature told him that “after bodily refection by the taking of\r\nmeat and drink, men are made more inclined to scurrilities, base talk,\r\nand (what is worse) detraction and strife”; he accordingly provides\r\nthat on ordinary days after the loving cup has gone round, there is to\r\nbe no lingering in hall after dinner or supper (except for the usual\r\n“potation” at curfew), but on festivals and other winter-nights, “on\r\nwhich, in honour of God and his Mother, or some other saint,” there is\r\na fire in the hall, the Fellows are allowed to indulge in singing or\r\nreading “poems, chronicles of the realm, and wonders of the world.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the modest amusements of the first Wykehamists. How was\r\nthe bulk of their time passed or meant to be passed? It must be\r\nremembered that Colleges were, in the first instance, not intended\r\nfor teaching-institutions at all; their members resorted for\r\nlectures to the public schools. Wykeham is the first Oxford founder\r\nwho contemplates any instruction being given to his scholars in\r\nCollege.[151] By his provisions on this head he became the founder\r\nof the Oxford tutorial system. Both at Paris and in Oxford, College\r\nteaching was destined, in process of time, practically to destroy\r\nUniversity teaching in the Faculty of Arts. But the process took place\r\nin totally different ways. The form which College-teaching has assumed\r\nin Oxford was inaugurated by Wykeham. He, or his academical advisers,\r\nsaw the unsuitableness of formal lectures in the public schools as a\r\nmeans of teaching mere boys. Hence he provides that for the first three\r\nyears of residence, the scholar was to be placed under the instruction\r\nof a tutor (“Informator”), selected from the senior Fellows. By about\r\n1408 the system had so far spread, that the lectures of the public\r\nschools were attended mainly by Bachelors.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly trace the career of a young Wykehamist newly arrived\r\nfrom Winchester.\r\n\r\nFor two years he is a probationary “scholar”; after that he becomes\r\na full member or “Fellow” of the College. It may be noticed that the\r\nNew College statutes are the earliest in which the term “Socius,”\r\noriginally applied to the students who live in the same house or hall,\r\nbegins to be used in a technical way to distinguish the full member of\r\nthe society (“verus et perpetuus socius”) from the mere probationer or\r\nchaplain or chorister: it is not till a still later date that the term\r\n“scholar” is confined to a Foundation-student who is not a Fellow.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the two years, the Fellow, though still an undergraduate,\r\ntakes his share in the government of the house on such occasions as\r\nthe election of a Warden. The ordinary administration, however, is in\r\nthe hands of a certain number of Seniors (varying in different cases).\r\nThe discipline was mainly in the hands of the Sub-Warden and the five\r\ndeans--two Artists, a Canonist, a Civilian, and a Theologian--who\r\npresided over the disputations of their respective Faculties. But\r\nevery one was compelled to act as a check upon every one else by\r\nmeans of the three yearly “chapters” or “scrutinies,” at which every\r\nFellow was invited and required to reveal anything which he might have\r\nobserved amiss in the conduct of his brethren since the last “Chapter.”\r\nThus, the discipline of the mediæval Colleges, or at least that which\r\ntheir founders desired to introduce, was modelled on that of the\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nThe lectures which our undergraduate had to attend before his B.A.\r\ndegree were as follows[152]:--\r\n\r\n_In College_: (1) In Grammar, the _Barbarismus_ of Donatus; (2) in\r\nArithmetic, the _Computus_, _i. e._ the method of finding Easter, with\r\nthe _Tractatus de Sphaera_ of Joannes de Sacrobosco; (3) in Logic, the\r\n_Isagoge_ of Porphyry, and Aristotle’s _Sophistici Elenchi_.\r\n\r\n_In the Public Schools_: The whole _Organon_ of Aristotle, the _Sex\r\nPrincipia_ of Gilbert de la Poirée, and the logical writings of\r\nBoethius (except _Topics_, Book IV.).\r\n\r\nThus during the first four years of his course our undergraduate was\r\noccupied mainly with Logic, at first in College, afterwards at the more\r\nformal lectures of the Regents in the public schools of the University.\r\nThis programme would represent a very dry and severe course of study\r\nto the modern Honour-man, while it would be simply appalling to the\r\nmodern Pass-man. The latter will, however, learn with relief that in\r\nOxford (unlike other mediæval Universities) it would appear doubtful\r\nwhether there was any actual examination for the B.A. degree. Then as\r\nnow, indeed, the student had to “respond _de quaestione_”; but in the\r\ncourse of his fourth year he would be admitted, as a matter of course,\r\n“to lecture upon a book of Aristotle.”\r\n\r\nAfter this he was commonly styled a Bachelor, though he did not become\r\none in strictness till he had gone through a disputation called\r\n“Determination.” This ordeal had to be passed to the satisfaction of\r\nthe other Bachelors. How glad would be the modern examinee to throw\r\nhimself upon the mercy of his fellows! Before being admitted to\r\ndetermine, the student had indeed to appear before the examiners of\r\nDeterminants, but it is not certain that these examiners did more than\r\nsatisfy themselves by the oaths and certificates of the candidates that\r\nthey had heard the required books: and it is quite clear that when once\r\nDetermination was passed, no further examination stood between him and\r\nthe M.A. degree.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval student was not, however, supposed to have completed his\r\neducation when he had become a Bachelor. To the four years of residence\r\nrequired for a B.A., three more must be added for the Mastership.\r\nDuring this time he attended lectures in “the Seven Arts” and “the\r\nthree Philosophies.” In the Arts his text-books were[153]:--In Grammar,\r\nPriscian; in Rhetoric, Aristotle or Boethius[154]; in Logic, Aristotle;\r\nin Arithmetic, Boethius; in Music, Boethius; in Geometry, Euclid; and\r\nin Astronomy, Ptolemy. Most of the Arts were however very quickly\r\nand perfunctorily disposed of. His real work as a Bachelor lay with\r\nthe three philosophies, studied exclusively in the Latin translation\r\nof Aristotle, the following being the “necessary books”:--In Natural\r\nPhilosophy, the _Physics_, or _De Anima_, or some other of the Physical\r\ntreatises; in Moral Philosophy, the _Ethics_; and in Metaphysical\r\nPhilosophy, the _Metaphysics_.\r\n\r\nTime would fail me to tell of the various disputations in which\r\nour student had to figure at various stages of his career; but\r\ndisputations, though to the nervous student their terrors must have\r\nexceeded those of modern _viva_, had this advantage, that there was no\r\n“plucking” or “ploughing” in the question. A candidate who had done\r\nvery badly might fail to get the required number of Masters to testify\r\nto his competency when he applied for the degree; and very incapable\r\nstudents, if poor and humbly-born, were probably choked off in this\r\nway. It is certain that a large number never took even the B.A. degree.\r\nBut there is no record of anybody having been formally refused a degree\r\nin Arts. And yet the Master’s degree in the Middle Ages was in reality\r\nwhat it still is in theory--a license to teach. For a year after\r\nadmission to his degree, the new M.A. was _necessario regens_, and was\r\nobliged to give “ordinary lectures” in the public schools. After that\r\nhe was free to enter upon the study of one of the higher Faculties.\r\n\r\nThose who took Theology spent the rest of their academical career in\r\nthe study of the Bible and “the Sentences” of Peter the Lombard--much\r\nmore of the Sentences than of the Bible. It took eleven years’ study to\r\nbecome a D.D.; naturally most got livings and “went down” before that.\r\n\r\nThose who obtained leave to study Law would usually take a degree in\r\nCivil Law first, and then proceed to the study of Canon Law, that is\r\nto say the _Decretum_ of Gratian and the Papal _Decretals_. There were\r\nalways to be twenty Canonists and Civilians in the House.\r\n\r\nTwo scholars alone might take up Medicine, and two Astronomy or\r\nAstrology. Wykeham is the only College-founder who treats Astronomy\r\nas a recognized Faculty; but belief in Astrology was on the increase\r\nin fourteenth-century England, and reached its maximum amid the\r\nenlightenment of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is time to allude to the curious “privilege” which exercised so\r\ndisastrous an effect upon the New College of two generations ago, the\r\nprivilege of taking degrees without examination. William of Wykeham\r\nis not responsible for this _damnosa hereditas_. Nothing is heard\r\nof it till the beginning of the seventeenth century; and then the\r\nUniversity recognized it as having been enjoyed since the earliest days\r\nof the College.[155] But its origin seems to be as follows.--So far\r\nfrom wishing his scholars to be exempt from the ordinary tests, the\r\nFounder peremptorily forbids them to sue for “graces” or dispensations\r\nfrom the residence or other statutable conditions of taking a degree.\r\nThe grace of congregation was then required only when some of these\r\nconditions had not been complied with; if they had been, the degree\r\nwas a matter of right. Even in Wykeham’s time these graces were\r\nscandalously common. In course of time the full statutable conditions\r\nwere so seldom complied with that the grace of congregation came to be\r\nasked for as a matter of course: Wykehamists alone, mindful of their\r\nfounder’s injunction, sought no graces. Hence what had been intended\r\nas an exceptional disability came to be regarded as an exceptional\r\nprivilege; and when regular examinations were at length introduced, it\r\nwas understood that the mysterious privilege carried with it exemption\r\nfrom this requirement also. Since a fair level of scholarship was\r\nsecured by the fact that the places in New College were competed for by\r\nthe boys of a first-rate classical school (although corrupt elections\r\nwere not unknown), the privilege was not particularly ruinous so long\r\nas the examinations continued on the basis of the Laudian statutes.\r\nIt was only when the Honour Schools were instituted at the beginning\r\nof this century that the exclusion of New College men from the\r\nExamination-schools shut out the College from the rapid improvement in\r\nindustry and intellectual vitality which that measure brought with it\r\nfor the best Oxford Colleges.\r\n\r\nThe character of the College during the earlier part of its history was\r\nexactly of the kind which the founder designed. In Wykeham’s day the\r\nScholastic Philosophy and Theology were already in their decadence.\r\nThe history of mediæval thought, so far as Oxford is concerned, ends\r\nwith that suppression of Wycliffism in 1411, which both Wykeham and\r\nhis College (though not quite free from the prevalent Lollardism) had\r\ncontributed to bring about. New College produced not schoolmen and\r\ntheologians like Merton, but respectable and successful ecclesiastics\r\nin abundance--foremost among them, Henry Chicheley, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, the founder of All Souls. It is a characteristic\r\ncircumstance that a New College man, John Wytenham, was at the head of\r\nthe Delegacy for condemning Wycliffe’s books in 1411, all the other\r\nDoctors being monks or friars.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the one piece of reform which Wykeham did seek\r\nto introduce into Oxford bore fruit in due season. New College, the\r\none College which was recruited exclusively from a great classical\r\nschool, became the home of what may be called the first phase of the\r\nRenaissance movement which showed itself in Oxford. It is during the\r\nlatter part of Thomas Chaundler’s Wardenship (1454-1475) that traces of\r\nthis movement become apparent. Chaundler’s own style, as is shown by\r\nhis published letters to Bishop Bekynton of Wells (himself a Wykehamist\r\nand benefactor of the College), was more correct than the ordinary\r\n“Oxford Latin” of his day; and some time before his death he brought\r\ninto the College as “Prælector” the first Oxford teacher of Greek,\r\nthe Italian scholar Vitelli, who remained till 1488 or 1489.[156] The\r\nmovement made little progress for the next two decades; but it must\r\nhave been Vitelli who imparted at least the rudiments of Greek and the\r\ndesire for further knowledge to William Grocyn, the great Wykehamist\r\nwith whose name the “Oxford Renaissance” is indissolubly associated.\r\nStanbridge, the Head Master of Magdalen College School, and author of\r\nthe reformed system of teaching grammar imitated by Lily at St. Paul’s\r\nand at other schools, and Archbishop Warham, the patron of Erasmus,\r\ndeserve mention among New College Humanists. To Warham we owe the\r\npanelling which imparts to our Hall much of its peculiar charm.\r\n\r\nBut if New College welcomed and fanned the first faint breath of\r\nthe Renaissance air in Oxford, wherever religion and politics\r\nwere concerned, she retained that character of rigid and immobile\r\nConservatism which the founder had sought to give it. John London\r\n(Warden 1526-1542) was foremost in the persecution of Protestant\r\nheretics in Oxford, though afterwards employed in the dirty work of\r\ncollecting evidence against the Monasteries. One of his victims was\r\nQuinley, a Fellow of his own College, whom he starved to death in the\r\nCollege “Steeple.” When asked by a friend what he would like to eat,\r\nhe pathetically exclaimed, “A Warden-pie.” His unnatural hunger might\r\nhave been appeased could he have seen his persecutor doing public\r\npenance for adultery, and ending his days a prisoner in the Fleet. The\r\nstoutest and most learned opponents of the Reformation were bred in\r\nWykeham’s Colleges--the men who were ejected or fled under Edward VI.,\r\nrose to high preferment under Mary, and became victims again under\r\nElizabeth--men like Harpesfield the ecclesiastical historian, Pits the\r\nbibliographer, and Nicholas Saunders, the Papal Legate, who organized\r\nthe Irish Insurrection of 1579.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastically and politically the Great Rebellion found the\r\nCollege again on the Conservative side. In 1642 the then Warden, Dr.\r\nRobert Pincke, as Pro-Vice-Chancellor, took the lead in preparing\r\nOxford to resist the Parliamentary forces. The University train-bands\r\nwere wont to drill “under his eyes” in the front quadrangle. Dons\r\nand undergraduates alike joined the ranks; among them is especially\r\nmentioned the New College D.C.L., Dr. Thomas Read, who trailed a pike.\r\nThe cloisters were converted into a magazine; and the New College\r\nschool-boys, being thus turned out of their usual school, were removed\r\n“to the choristers’ chamber at the east end of the common hall of the\r\nsaid College: it was then a dark, nasty room, and very unfit for such a\r\npurpose, which made the scholars often complaine, but in vaine.” These\r\nare the words of Anthony à Wood, then a little boy of eleven, and a\r\npupil in the school.\r\n\r\nWhile the school-boys were with difficulty restrained from the novel\r\nexcitement of watching the drills in the quadrangle, the Warden’s\r\nseverer studies had been no less interrupted. He had been sent by the\r\nUniversity to treat with the old New College-man, Lord Say, who was\r\nsupposed to be in command of the Parliamentary forces at Aylesbury.\r\nUnfortunately for Pincke, Lord Say was not there, and the Parliamentary\r\ncommander, being without Wykehamical sympathies, sent the Doctor a\r\nprisoner to the Gate-house at Westminster. Meanwhile Lord Say had\r\nentered Oxford, and immediately proceeded to New College “to search for\r\nplate and arms” (no doubt he knew where to look), and even overhauled\r\nthe papers in the Warden’s study. “One of his men broke down the King’s\r\npicture of alabaster gilt, which stood there; at which his lordship\r\nseemed to be much displeased.” It is not very clear how Warden Pincke\r\nfound his way back to Oxford; but soon after the Parliamentary triumph,\r\nhe came to an untimely end by falling down the steps of his own\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nPincke was evidently a learned as well as an active man, and\r\npublished a curious collection of _Quaestiones in Logica, Ethica,\r\nPhysica, et Metaphysica_ (Oxon. 1640); this is a list of problems\r\nwith a formidable array of references to authorities, classical,\r\npatristic, and scholastic. He found time, even in the busy days of\r\nhis Vice-Chancellorship, to write a narrative of his proceedings in\r\nthat office, which was still extant in MS. after the Restoration. The\r\nonly other Wardens who have left any considerable literary remains are\r\nPincke’s predecessor, Lake, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, and\r\nShuttleworth (Warden 1822-1840), afterwards Bishop of Chichester, a\r\nsturdy opponent of the Tractarian movement.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of New College learning of the early seventeenth\r\ncentury, we must not pass over Dr. Thomas James, the first Bodley’s\r\nLibrarian, who, besides being a really learned writer on theological\r\nsubjects, catalogued the MSS. in the libraries of the Colleges of both\r\nUniversities as well as those under his own charge.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the Puritan Visitors in 1647, no College gave so\r\nmuch trouble as New College. All but unanimously the members of the\r\nfoundation declared that it was contrary to their oaths to submit\r\nto any Visitor who was an actual (_i. e._ resident) member of the\r\nUniversity, which was the case with the most active Visitors. Only two\r\nunconditional, and one qualified submission, are recorded. Forty-nine\r\nout of the fifty-three members of the foundation (choir included) then\r\nin residence were sentenced to expulsion on March 15th, 1647-8. But it\r\nwas not till June 6th that four of the worst offenders were ordered\r\nto move; on July 7th the order was extended to seventeen more. On\r\nAugust 1st, 1648, Dr. Stringer, the Warden whom the Fellows had elected\r\nin defiance of the Visitors, was removed by Parliament, and in 1649\r\nnineteen more foundationers were “outed.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that the Fellows left by the Visitors, or even\r\nthose put in the place of the ejected Fellows, conformed heartily to\r\nthe Puritan _régime_. The bursars appointed by the Commission found\r\nthe buttery and muniment-room shut against them. George Marshall,\r\nthe Parliamentarian Warden appointed in 1649, had to complain to the\r\nVisitors that the College persisted in remitting the “sconces” imposed\r\nby him upon Fellows for absence from the no doubt lengthy Puritan\r\nprayers. Moreover, the Visitors, with scrupulous desire to minimize\r\nthe breach of continuity, elected only Wykehamists into the vacant\r\nplaces, with, indeed, the notable exception of the intruded Warden;\r\nand these new Fellows were most of them no doubt either Royalists and\r\nChurchmen, or at least men whose Puritan republicanism was of no very\r\nbigoted type. Hence we find that Woodward, the Warden freely elected by\r\nthe College on Marshall’s death in 1658, retained his place after the\r\nRestoration. Even in 1654 Evelyn found the chapel “in its ancient garb,\r\nnotwithstanding the scrupulosity of the times.” After the Restoration\r\nwe are not surprised to find that the Royalist majority was strong\r\nenough to turn out many of the “godly” minority before the King’s\r\nCommissioners arrived in Oxford, and to reinstate “the Common Prayer\r\nbefore it was read in other churches.”\r\n\r\nTwo of “the Seven Bishops” were New College men, the saintly Ken,\r\nBishop of Bath and Wells, and Turner, Bishop of Ely. One of their\r\nJudges, Richard Holloway, the only one who charged boldly in\r\ntheir favour, had been Fellow of the College till ejected by the\r\nParliamentary Visitors.\r\n\r\nThe annals of our University in the eighteenth century are of an\r\ninglorious order; and New College exhibits in an intensified form the\r\ncharacteristic tendencies of Oxford at large. The building of the\r\n“new common chamber” (one of the first in Oxford) and of the garden\r\nquadrangle, at the end of the seventeenth century (finished 1684),\r\nseem to herald the age in which the increase of ease, comfort, and\r\nluxury kept pace with the decay of study, education, and learning. The\r\n_Vimen Quadrifidum_ of Winchester still indeed kept alive a tradition\r\nof classical scholarship which even the possession of an Academic\r\nsinecure at eighteen, with total exemption from University examinations\r\nand exercises, could not quite extinguish; but there was a significant\r\nproverb about New College men which ran, “golden Scholars, silver\r\nBachelors, leaden Masters.” One of the last men of learning whom New\r\nCollege produced was John Ayliffe, D.C.L., the author of the _Past and\r\nPresent State of the University of Oxford_ (1714), who was expelled\r\nthe University, deprived of his degree, and compelled to resign his\r\nFellowship for certain “bold and necessary truths” contained in that\r\nbook, partly of a personal, partly of a political (_i. e._ Whiggish)\r\ncharacter. Perhaps the most respectable and yet characteristic product\r\nof New College during the _ferrea aetas_ which succeeded were Robert\r\nLowth, the scholarly antagonist of the slipshod Warburton, and author\r\nof the famous lectures _On the Poetry of the Hebrews_, successively\r\nBishop of St. David’s, Oxford and London.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the century New College harboured a staunch\r\ndefender of the Church (including some of its abuses), but a staunch\r\nassailant of much else in that old _régime_ to which it belonged.\r\nSydney Smith came up from Winchester in 1789, having been Prefect of\r\nHall and third on the roll; but though in the College, he was little of\r\nit. It is curious that the most brilliant talker of the century does\r\nnot seem to have left much reputation behind him in College society.\r\nPerhaps his extreme poverty may have something to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe other most notable Fellow of New College in the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century, Augustus Hare (joint-author of _Guesses at Truth_),\r\nwas also an assailant of the abuses among which he was brought up. When\r\nacting as “Poser” in the Winchester election of 1829, he had the spirit\r\nto resist the claims of certain candidates to be admitted to one or\r\nother of the two Colleges without examination, as “Founder’s-kin.” At\r\nthe time there were already twenty-four “Founders” at New College, and\r\nfourteen or fifteen at Winchester. His appeal was heard by the Bishop\r\nof Winchester as Visitor, with Mr. Justice Patteson and Dr. Lushington\r\nas Assessors; a New College man, Mr. Erle (afterwards Lord Chief\r\nJustice), was one of the petitioner’s counsel. The case was argued not\r\nupon the ground that the claimants’ demand was based on fictitious\r\npedigrees (which was probably the fact), but upon the precarious\r\ncontention that by the Civil and Canon Law the term “consanguineus”\r\napplies at most only to persons within the tenth generation of descent\r\nfrom a common ancestor, and the appeal was naturally dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe era of reform may be said to begin with the voluntary renunciation\r\nby New College, in 1834, of its exemption from University examinations.\r\nThe College still retains, indeed, the right to obtain for its Fellows\r\ndegrees without “supplication” in congregation; and when a Fellow\r\nof New College takes his M.A., the Proctor still says, “Postulat\r\nA.B., e Collegio Novo,” instead of the ordinary “Supplicat, etc.,” or\r\n(more correctly) omits the name altogether. In spite of the vehement\r\nopposition of the College, a more extensive reform was carried\r\nout on truly Conservative lines by an Ordinance of the University\r\nCommissioners in 1857. The Fellowships were reduced to forty (in\r\n1870 to thirty); but the mystic seventy of the original foundation\r\nis maintained by the addition in 1866 of ten open scholarships to\r\nthe thirty which were still reserved for Winchester men. Further,\r\ncommoners[157] were made eligible for Fellowships as well as scholars.\r\nHalf the Fellowships are still reserved for Wykehamists, that is, men\r\neducated either at Winchester or at New College. The chaplaincies are\r\nnow reduced to three, and the number of lay choir-men increased.\r\n\r\nSince that beneficent reform, ever since loyally accepted and\r\nvigorously carried forward by the Warden and Fellows, the history of\r\nthe College has been one of continuous material expansion, numerical\r\ngrowth, and academic progress. In 1854 the society voluntarily opened\r\nits doors to non-Wykehamist commoners, whose increasing numbers soon\r\ncalled for the new buildings, the first block of which was opened in\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nWe take our leave of the College with a glance at one or two of the\r\nquaint customs which have unfortunately, if inevitably, disappeared in\r\nthe course of the process of modernization.\r\n\r\nDown to 1830, or a little later, the College was summoned to dinner by\r\ntwo choir-boys[158] who, at a stated minute, started from the College\r\ngateway, shouting in unison and in lengthened syllables--“Tem-pus est\r\nvo-can-di à-manger, O Seigneurs.” It was their business to make this\r\nsentence _last out_ till they reached with their final note the College\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nOn Ascension Day the College and choir used to go in procession to St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital (the remains of which may still be seen on the\r\nCowley road a little beyond the new church) where a short service was\r\nheld, after which they proceeded to the adjoining well (Strowell),\r\nheard an Epistle and Gospel, and sang certain songs.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century the College was still waked\r\nby the porter striking the door at the bottom of each staircase with\r\na “wakening mallet.” Fellows are still summoned to the quarterly\r\nCollege-meetings in this antique fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. ANDREW CLARK, M.A., FELLOW OF LINCOLN COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln College, or, in its full and official title, “The College of\r\nthe Blessed Mary and All Saints, Lincoln, in the University of Oxford,”\r\nwas founded by Richard Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, in the year 1429, in\r\nthe eleventh year of his episcopate and one year and one month before\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nThe founder, a native of Yorkshire, was educated in Oxford, and held\r\nthe office of Northern (or Junior) Proctor in 1407. He was promoted to\r\na prebendship in York Cathedral in 1415; and was raised to the see of\r\nLincoln in 1419. In 1424 Pope Martin V., who held him in great esteem,\r\nadvanced him to the Archbishopric of York; but the king (Henry VI.)\r\nrefused to sanction the nomination; and Fleming, ejected from York, had\r\nsome difficulty in getting “translated” back to Lincoln.\r\n\r\nRichard Fleming, as a graduate resident in Oxford, had been noted for\r\nhis sympathy with the tenets of the Wycliffists; but in his later years\r\nhe had come to regard the movement with alarm, foreboding (as his\r\npreface to the statutes for his college says) that it was one of those\r\ntroubles of the latter days which were to vex the Church towards the\r\nend of the world. The Wycliffists professed to accept the authority of\r\nthe Scriptures and to find in them the warrant for their attacks on\r\naccepted Church doctrines and institutions. In these same Scriptures,\r\nrightly understood and expounded, Fleming believed that the authority\r\nof the Church was laid down beyond contradiction. And so, in the\r\nbitterness of his repulse from York, which he perhaps attributed to\r\nthe growing spirit of rebelliousness against the Church, he determined\r\nto found (to use his own words) “collegiolum quoddam theologorum”--“a\r\nlittle college of true students in theology who would defend the\r\nmysteries of the sacred page against those ignorant laics who profaned\r\nwith swinish snouts its most holy pearls.”\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to note the means by which he carried out his\r\npurpose. There is a common impression that these pre-Reformation\r\nprelates were possessed of great wealth. In some few instances, this\r\nwas the case, namely, where the prelate had held in plurality several\r\nwealthy benefices, or had occupied a rich see for a great number of\r\nyears, or had inherited a large private fortune; but in the majority of\r\ncases, the bishops were not wealthy men, and from year to year spent\r\nthe revenues of their sees in works of public munificence or private\r\ncharity. Every bishop, however, had partially under his control several\r\nof the Church endowments of his diocese, and could divert them, even\r\nin perpetuity, to the use of any institution he favoured, so long as\r\nthey were not alienated from the Church. Accordingly, Fleming proposed,\r\nas it seems, to build the College out of his own moneys; but to\r\nprovide for its endowment by attaching to it existing ecclesiastical\r\nrevenues. He therefore obtained the sanction of the king (Henry VI.’s\r\ncharter is dated 13th Oct., 1427) and Parliament, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, the mother-church of Lincoln, the Archdeacon of Oxford, the\r\nparishioners of all three parishes, and the Mayor and Corporation of\r\nOxford, to dissolve the three contiguous parish churches of All Saints,\r\nSt. Mildred, and St. Michael,--all three being in the patronage of\r\nthe Bishop of Lincoln,--as also the chantry of St. Anne in the church\r\nof All Saints, which was in the patronage of the city of Oxford; and\r\nto unite them into a collegiate church or college, which was to be\r\n“Lincoln College.”\r\n\r\nSt. Mildred’s was a small parish occupying the present site of Exeter\r\nCollege, and about half of the site of Jesus College; its church was\r\nsadly out of repair, and had no funds for its maintenance; and the\r\nordinary parish population had given place to Academical students with\r\ntheir Halls and Schools. Fleming therefore planned to build his college\r\non the site of this church and its churchyard, increasing the area\r\nby the purchase, on 4th April, 1430, of Craunford Hall, which stood\r\nsouth of the churchyard, and, on the 20th June, 1430, by the purchase\r\nof Little Deep Hall, which stood on the east of the churchyard. The\r\nground-plot so formed is represented by the present outer quadrangle of\r\nthe College.\r\n\r\nThe two churches of All Saints and St. Michael were to provide the\r\nendowment of the College. The lands and houses originally belonging\r\nto them had already been taken away when they had been reduced\r\nfrom rectories to vicarages, before they came to the patronage of\r\nthe bishops of Lincoln. Their only revenues now were therefore the\r\nofferings in church, the fees at burials, etc., and the petty tithe\r\n(called “Sunday pence,” being a penny per week from every house of over\r\ntwenty shillings annual value in the parish, doubled at the four great\r\nfestivals, viz. Christmas, Easter, Ascension, Whitsuntide).[159] These\r\nrevenues, together with the income of the chantry of St. Anne, seem\r\nto have amounted to about £30; and out of them, when the College was\r\nfounded, £12 was to be paid for the maintenance of divine service in\r\nthe two churches and the chantry.\r\n\r\nWith these revenues Fleming proposed to endow a college consisting\r\nof a Warden and seven Fellows, who should, (1) study Theology, the\r\nqueen and empress of all the faculties (_omnium imperatrix et domina\r\nfacultatum_); (2) pray for the welfare of the founder during his life\r\nand for the health of his soul after his death, as also for the souls\r\nof his kindred and of his benefactors and of all faithful deceased.\r\n\r\nFleming’s charter, uniting the churches and erecting the College,\r\nis dated 19th Dec., 1429. He did not live to see his project\r\naccomplished, for he died suddenly on 25th January, 1430-1.\r\n\r\nIn what condition was the College when the founder died? The following\r\npoints may be noted:--\r\n\r\n(1) The College was founded, and had received its charter of\r\nincorporation, together with certain “ordinances” for its government,\r\nwhich Rotheram says he imitated in framing the 1480 statutes;\r\n\r\n(2) The buildings of the College had been begun, namely, the present\r\ntower, with the rooms over the gateway, in which, according to usual\r\ncustom, the Head of the College was to reside, and control the comings\r\nin and goings out of its members;\r\n\r\n(3) MSS. had been given to the library;[160] the Catalogue of 1474\r\nspecifying twenty-five “books” as given by the founder, chiefly\r\ntheological (among these, _Walden against Wycliffe_), but one or two\r\nhistorical;\r\n\r\n(4) A small annual revenue had been provided for, but this would\r\nprobably not become available till the deaths, or cessions, of the\r\nvicars of All Saints’ and St. Michael’s, and the chaplain of St. Anne;\r\n\r\n(5) A rector (William Chamberleyn) had been named by the founder, but\r\nno Fellows; so that when Chamberleyn died (7th March, 1433-4) Fleming’s\r\nsuccessor, Bishop William Grey, finding it impossible to supply the\r\nvacancy by election, according to Fleming’s ordinances, himself\r\nnominated (on 7th May, 1434) Dr. John Beke.\r\n\r\nIn Beke’s rectorship (1434-1460) the orphan College found good patrons\r\nto carry out the intentions of its deceased founder.\r\n\r\nBefore 1437 John Forest, Dean of Wells, built the Hall, the Kitchen,\r\nthe Library (now the Subrector’s room), the Chapel (now the Senior\r\nLibrary), with living rooms above and below the Library and below the\r\nChapel, so that he deservedly was recognized by the College as its\r\n“co-founder.”\r\n\r\nIn 1444 William Finderne, of Childrey, gave a large sum of money\r\ntowards the buildings, and his estate of Seacourt, a farm at Botley\r\nnear Oxford; in return the College was to appoint an additional Fellow\r\n(“_sacerdos et collega_”) to pray for Finderne.\r\n\r\nIn 1436, we have evidence of a Rector, seven Fellows, and two Chaplains\r\nof Lincoln College. An account-book of 1456 has been preserved, showing\r\nthe Rector and five Fellows in residence and in receipt of commons.\r\n\r\nBeke resigned in 1460, and was succeeded in Jan. 1460-1 by the third\r\nRector, John Tristrop, who had been resident in College as a Commoner\r\nin 1455, and had probably at one time been Fellow.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of Tristrop’s rectorship the dissolution of the\r\nCollege was threatened. The charter of incorporation had been obtained\r\nfrom Henry VI.; and now that he had been deposed (on 4th March,\r\n1460-1) by Edward IV., some powerful person seems to have coveted\r\nthe possessions of the College, and suggested that Edward IV. should\r\nnot grant it a charter, but seize it into his own hands. The College\r\nbesought the protection of George Nevill, Bishop of Exeter, Lord High\r\nChancellor, himself a graduate of Oxford. By Nevill’s influence the\r\nCollege secured from Edward IV., on 23rd Jan., 1461-2, pardon of all\r\noffences and release of all amercements incurred by them, and on 9th\r\nFeb., 1461-2, a charter confirming the College and extending its right\r\nto hold lands in mortmain. The reality of the danger and the gratitude\r\nof the College for preservation are sufficiently apparent by the\r\nway in which the Rector and Fellows tendered their thanks to Bishop\r\nNevill: although he had given nothing to the College, yet by a solemn\r\ninstrument, dated 20th Aug., 1462, they assigned him the same place in\r\ntheir prayers as the founder himself, “because he had delivered the\r\nCollege from being torn to pieces by dogs and plunderers.”\r\n\r\nThis danger averted, and confidence in the legal position of the\r\nCollege restored, the stream of benefactions again began to flow.\r\n\r\nIn 1463 the College purchased from University College three halls lying\r\nnext to it in St. Mildred’s (now Brasenose) Lane and in Turl Street,\r\nthus doubling its original ground-plot.\r\n\r\nIn 1464 Bishop Thomas Beckington’s executors, out of the monies he\r\nhad left to be applied by them to charitable uses, gave £200 to build\r\na house for the Rector at the south end of the hall, consisting of\r\na large room on the ground-floor and another on the first floor\r\n(the dining-room and drawing-room of the present Rector’s Lodgings),\r\nwith cellar and attic. On the west front of this building was carved\r\nBeckington’s rebus[161]--a flourished T, followed by a beacon set in a\r\nbarrel (_i. e._ “beacon”--“tun”) for “T. Beckington”--and his coat of\r\narms, with the rebus, on the east front.\r\n\r\nIn 1465 the founder’s nephew, Robert Fleming, Dean of Lincoln, gave\r\nthe library thirty-eight MSS., chiefly of classical Latin authors,\r\ncomprising Cæsar, Cicero, Aulus Gellius, Horace, Juvenal, Livy,\r\nPlautus, Quintilian, Sallust, Suetonius, Terence, Virgil. Most of\r\nthese, along with the old plate of the College, were embezzled by\r\nEdward VI.’s commissioners, under pretence of purging the library of\r\nRomanist books.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards the very existence of the College was a second\r\ntime brought into danger. The scribe who wrote out the charter of\r\n1461-2 (1 Edward IV.), had done his work in a most slovenly manner,\r\ndropping here and there words required by the grammatical structure.\r\nUnfortunately for the College, in one important place the words “_et\r\nsuccessoribus_” were omitted; and some one in authority, fastening on\r\nthis omission, suggested that the grant was only to the Rector and\r\nFellows for the time being, and on their death or removal would lapse\r\nto the Crown. The College appealed, in 1474, for protection to Thomas\r\nRotheram, Bishop of Lincoln and therefore Visitor of the College, and\r\n(from May 1474 to April 1475, and again from Sept. 1475) Lord High\r\nChancellor of England.\r\n\r\nThe manner of this appeal, as recounted by Subrector Robert Parkinson\r\nabout 1570, in the College register, is sufficiently dramatic. When\r\nRotheram, in the visitation of his diocese, was at Oxford, the Rector\r\nor one of the Fellows of Lincoln College preached before him from the\r\ntext, Ps. lxxx. (lxxxi.), vers. 14, 15, “Behold and visit this vine,\r\nand complete it which thy right hand hath planted.” The preacher\r\ndescribed the desolate condition of the College, founded by Rotheram’s\r\npredecessor, unprotected from the enemies who sought to destroy it;\r\nand his words so moved the bishop that he at once rose up and told the\r\npreacher that he would perform his desire.[162]\r\n\r\nRotheram was not slow in fulfilling his promise. To relieve the\r\npresent necessities of the College he gave, in July 1475, a grant\r\nof £4 per annum during his life. Thereafter he completed the front\r\nquadrangle by building its southern side;[163] and he very greatly\r\nincreased the endowments by impropriating[164] the rectories of Long\r\nCombe in Oxfordshire and Twyford in Bucks. He increased the number of\r\nFellowships by five; but at least three of these had been provided for\r\nby earlier benefactors, one by Finderne, one by Forest and Beckington’s\r\nexecutors, and one (for the study of Canon Law) by John Crosby,\r\nTreasurer of Lincoln Cathedral.\r\n\r\nTo secure the legal position of the College, he obtained from Edward\r\nIV., 16th June, 1478, a larger charter. In this the king recites his\r\nformer charter; mentions the doubt which had arisen by reason of its\r\nomitting the words “_et successoribus_”; and then sets the position\r\nof the College as a _perpetua persona_ for ever at rest. In the same\r\ncharter the king still further increased the amount of lands which the\r\nCollege might hold in mortmain.\r\n\r\nOn 11th Feb., 1479-80, Rotheram provided for the internal government\r\nof the College by the giving of a full body of statutes. Rotheram\r\ntherefore is justly regarded as our restorer and second founder.\r\n\r\nThe later years of the fifteenth and the earlier years of the\r\nsixteenth centuries increased the estates of the College by four\r\ngreat benefactions. By an agreement with Margaret Parker, widow of\r\nWilliam Dagville, a parishioner of All Saints parish, the College in\r\n1488 (5 Henry VIII.) came into possession of considerable property\r\nin Oxford,[165] which had been bequeathed by Dagville, subject to his\r\nwidow’s life interest, by his will dated 2nd June, 1474, and proved 9th\r\nNov., 1476. In 1508 William Smith, Bishop of Lincoln, gave his manors\r\nof Senclers in Chalgrove in Oxfordshire, and of Elston (or Bushbury)\r\nin Staffordshire. In 1518 Edmund Audley, Bishop of Sarum, gave £400,\r\nwith which lands in Buckinghamshire were bought. And in 1537 Edward\r\nDarby, Fellow in 1493, and now Archdeacon of Stowe, gave a large sum of\r\nmoney, with which lands in Yorkshire were bought. Darby directed that\r\nthe number of Fellowships should be increased by three, to be nominated\r\nby himself in his lifetime (one of the first three whom he nominated as\r\nFellows was Richard Bruarne, afterwards Regius Professor of Hebrew);\r\nand afterwards, one to be nominated by the Bishop of Lincoln, the other\r\ntwo to be elected by the College.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Bishop Smith’s benefaction, we may note here\r\nthe singular fatality which has led the College in successive ages\r\nto quarrel with its benefactors. Writing in 1570, Subrector Robert\r\nParkinson says, “Bishop Smith would have given to our College all\r\nthat he afterwards gave to Brasenose (founded by him in 1509) had\r\nhe agreed with the Rector and Fellows that then were.” With Smith’s\r\nchange of plans, part of Darby’s benefaction went, for he also founded\r\na Fellowship in Brasenose. Sir Nathaniel Lloyd was a chief benefactor\r\nin the early eighteenth century to All Souls in Oxford, and to Trinity\r\nHall in Cambridge: in three successive drafts of his will he takes\r\nthe trouble to write, “I gave £500 to Lincoln College, which was not\r\napplied as I directed: so no more from me!” Lord Crewe, our greatest\r\nbenefactor of modern times, well deserving the title of “our third\r\nfounder,” was almost provoked[166] to recalling his benefaction.\r\nA quarrel with John Radcliffe diverted from Lincoln College the\r\nmunificence which doubled the buildings of University College and\r\nprovided for the erection of the Radcliffe Library, the Infirmary, and\r\nthe Observatory. Other instances, both remote and recent, might also be\r\ncited.\r\n\r\nHaving now brought the history of the endowments of the College to that\r\npoint where their application within its walls can be conveniently\r\ndescribed, it is necessary to leave the annals of the College for\r\na time and consider its organization, as it was arranged for by\r\nRotheram’s statutes, modified slightly by subsequent benefactions.\r\n\r\nThe College was to consist of (I) the Rector; (II) Fellows; (III)\r\nChaplains; (IV) Commoners; (V) and Servants.\r\n\r\n(I) To the Rector was, of course, in general terms committed the\r\ngovernment of the College and its members. But he was allowed large\r\nlimits of absence from College; and he was to be capable of holding\r\nany ecclesiastical benefice in conjunction with his rectorship. In the\r\nfounder’s intention, therefore, the headship of the College was to be\r\nan office of dignity, and the holder set free from the ordinary routine\r\nof college work. It was also to be a reward of past services to the\r\nCollege, because only a Fellow, or ex-Fellow, was eligible for the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n(II) The Fellows were to be thirteen in number, counting the Rector\r\nas holding a Fellowship; and consequently, when augmented by Darby,\r\nsixteen. Provision was made for the increase of their number if the\r\nrevenues of the College could bear it; but this provision seems never\r\nto have been acted on. The corresponding provision for diminution of\r\nthe number of Fellowships to eleven, to seven, to five, and even to\r\nthree, was, however, from time to time had recourse to; and as a rule,\r\nthe circumstances of the College have not permitted of the extreme\r\nnumber of Fellowships being filled up.[167]\r\n\r\nThe Fellows were to be elected from graduates of Oxford or Cambridge,\r\nborn within the counties or dioceses described below; and if not\r\nalready in priest’s orders were to take them immediately they were\r\nof age for them. A Bachelor of Arts was not to be elected unless\r\nthere was no Master of Arts possessed of the proper county or diocese\r\nqualification. When, however, Darby in 1537 gave his three additional\r\nFellowships, he recognized the fact that there might be no graduate in\r\nthe University eligible, and provided that they might be filled up by\r\nthe election of an undergraduate Fellow[168] either from undergraduates\r\nin Oxford, or by taking a boy from some grammar school in Lincoln\r\ndiocese; but the person so elected was to have no voice in College\r\nbusiness until he had taken his degree.\r\n\r\nTaking the full number of Rector, twelve Foundation Fellows, and three\r\nDarby Fellows, the sixteen places on the foundation of Lincoln College\r\nwere assigned as follows--\r\n\r\nOne Fellowship was to be filled up from the diocese of Wells (_i. e._\r\ncounty of Somerset), in memory of the benefactions of John Forest,\r\ndean, and Thomas Beckington, bishop, of Wells; but this Fellow was\r\nspecially excluded from election to the Rectorship or Subrectorship.\r\nAll the other places were to be apportioned between the dioceses of\r\nYork and Lincoln. It is not known whether Fleming, himself a native of\r\nYorkshire and bishop of Lincoln, had made any such limitations; but\r\nRotheram, possessed of the same twofold interest, draws particular\r\nattention to the fact that his College is designed to make provision\r\nfor natives of these two dioceses which had hitherto been neglected by\r\nthe founders of colleges. Four places were assigned for natives of the\r\ncounty of Lincoln, with a preference to natives of the archdeaconry of\r\nLincoln; four places were open to natives of the diocese of Lincoln;\r\ntwo places were assigned for natives of the county of York, with a\r\npreference to natives of the Archdeaconry of York, and within that with\r\na more particular preference to the parish of Rotherham, in which the\r\nsecond founder was born; two places were to be open to natives of the\r\ndiocese of York. Of the Darby Fellowships, one was to be for a native\r\nof the Archdeaconry of Stowe, one for a native of Leicestershire or\r\nNorthamptonshire (with a preference to the former), and one for a\r\nnative of Oxfordshire.[169]\r\n\r\nThe next point which we may consider is the duties of the Fellows.\r\nThese may be classified as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) They were to be “theologi” (students of theology), with the single\r\nexception of the holder of the Fellowship founded by John Crosby for\r\nthe study of Canon Law. Their orthodoxy was ensured by a very stringent\r\nclause directed against heretical opinions:--“if it be proved by two\r\ntrustworthy witnesses that any Fellow, _in public or in private_, has\r\nfavoured heretical tenets, and in particular that pestilent sect,\r\nlately sprung up, which assails the sacraments, divers orders and\r\ndignities, and property of the Church,” the College is to compel him to\r\nimmediate submission and correction, or else to expel him.\r\n\r\n(2) They were to pray for the souls of founders and benefactors, at the\r\ncelebration of mass, in bidding-prayers, in the graces in hall, after\r\ndisputations, and on the anniversaries of their death. This was the\r\nchief duty contemplated by all pre-Reformation benefactors.\r\n\r\n(3) They had considerable duties to perform with regard to their four\r\nChurches which may be classified thus:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) As regards spiritualities. Although the ordinary services of the\r\nChurches throughout the year were to be discharged by four salaried\r\nChaplains, yet, during Lent, a Fellow of the College was to assist the\r\nChaplain of All Saints in hearing confessions and in other ministerial\r\nfunctions; another, similarly, to assist the Chaplain of St.\r\nMichael’s; another, to assist the Chaplain at Combe; and the Rector,\r\nor a Fellow appointed by him, to assist the Chaplain at Twyford. On\r\nall greater festival days, the Rector or his representative (in an\r\namice, if he had one, and if not, in surplice, and the hood of his\r\ndegree), accompanied by all the Fellows (except one who was to attend\r\nas representative of the College at St. Michael’s), was to go to\r\nservice at All Saints.[170] St. Mildred’s Church was to be commemorated\r\non her day (13th July) by a celebration in the College chapel; and the\r\nbenefaction of John Bucktot by a Fellow going to Ashendon to say mass\r\non St. Matthias day, and that of William Finderne by a similar service\r\nin Childrey parish church.[171] Sermons in English were to be preached\r\nat All Saints on Easter Day and on All Saints Day,[172] by the Rector,\r\nand on the dedication day of that Church, by one of the Fellows; and at\r\nSt. Michael’s on Michaelmas Day, by one of the Fellows.[173]\r\n\r\n(_b_) As regards temporalities. On the 6th of May a “Rector chori” was\r\nto be appointed for All Saints and a “Rector chori” for St. Michael’s;\r\ntheir duties were to occupy the Rector’s stall in the chancel, and to\r\ncollect all alms, fees, etc., for the bursar of the College. These\r\nduties at Twyford belonged to the Rector of the College, and at Combe\r\nwere supervised by him.\r\n\r\n(4) As regards the ordinary academical curriculum, the founder’s\r\nrequirements were by no means exacting.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The College disputations were to be weekly during Term, in Logic\r\nand Philosophy on Wednesdays, for those members who had taken B.A. and\r\nnot yet proceeded to M.A. (there being no undergraduates, according to\r\nthe founder’s scheme); and in Theology on Fridays, for all members of\r\nM.A. standing. Both sets of disputations were to cease during Lent,\r\nwhen the Fellows were engaged in their ministerial duties.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Fellows, elected as B.A., were to proceed to M.A. as soon as\r\npossible; Fellows were to take B.D. (or B. Can. L. in case of the\r\nCanonist Fellow) within nine years from M.A.; and, unless the College\r\napproved of an excuse, to proceed to D.D. (or D. Can. L.) within six\r\nyears later. The last of these provisions, however, was practically a\r\ndead letter, for the College never forced any Fellow to the expensive\r\ndignity of the Doctorate.\r\n\r\n(5) Study, however, as distinct from formal academical exercises,\r\nwas inculcated as a virtue both by persuasions and punishments. The\r\nSubrector was charged to rebuke Fellows not merely for offences against\r\nmorality and decorum, but for being neglectful of books; and unless the\r\nFellows so admonished submitted and mended their ways, they were to be\r\nexpelled.\r\n\r\nThe founder and later benefactors, as has been from time to time noted,\r\nmade gifts of “books” (_i. e._ MSS.) for the use of the Fellows;\r\nand John Forest built a library for their reception. According to\r\nRotheram’s statutes, two classes of books were to be recognized--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Those which were to be chained in the library, and which the\r\nreader had therefore to consult there. According to the Catalogue of\r\n1474, this library then contained 135 MSS., arranged on seven desks.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Those which were to be considered as “in the common choice” of\r\nthe Rector and Fellows. On each 6th November a list of these was to be\r\nmade out; the Rector was to choose one, and after him the Fellows one\r\neach, according to their seniority,[174] and so on till the books were\r\nall taken out; thereafter, the Fellows were to take the books to their\r\nown rooms, depositing a bond for their safe custody and return. In 1476\r\nthere were 35 books in this “lending library,” different from the 135\r\nabove-mentioned. A record is also found of the books (18 in number)\r\nthus borrowed by the Fellows in 1595 and (17 in number) in 1596; among\r\nthem are two copies of Augustine _De civitate Dei_, and one of Servius\r\n_In Virgilium_.\r\n\r\n(6) The Fellows had to take their share in the ordinary routine of\r\nCollege business, especially in the two chief meetings on 6th May and\r\n6th November, called “chapters” (_capitula_), and to serve when called\r\nupon in the College offices. These were three in number, all held for\r\none year only.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Subrector was charged with the general management of the\r\nCollege during the Rector’s absence, the supervision of the conduct\r\nof the Fellows and commoners, the presiding over disputations, and\r\nthe writing of all letters on College business. The emblem of his\r\noffice was a whip, which, with his alternative title (Subrector _sive_\r\nCorrector[175]), is eloquent as to his original duty of correcting\r\nfaults of conduct by corporal punishment. This scourge of four tails,\r\nmade of plaited cord after the old fashion, is still extant and\r\nperfect, is solemnly laid down by the Subrector at the conclusion of\r\nhis term of office, and restored to him next day on his re-election.\r\nIt has been coveted for the Pitt-Rivers anthropological museum, as a\r\ngenuine example of the “flagellum” of mediæval discipline.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Bursar (_thesaurarius_) was charged with the duties of paying\r\nbills, collecting rents, and keeping accounts; of seeing that commons\r\nwere duly and sufficiently supplied; and of governing the College\r\nservants (over whom he had the power, with the consent of the Rector,\r\nof appointment and dismissal).\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Key-keeper (_claviger_) was to keep one of the three keys\r\nwith which the Treasury was locked, and one of the three keys of the\r\nchest in the Treasury which contained the College money, the other keys\r\nof these sets being in the charge of the Rector and Subrector. This\r\n“chest of three keys” corresponds to the balance to the credit of the\r\nCollege at its bankers and its investments in the public stocks; in it\r\nwere placed any surplus money or donations to meet sudden calls for\r\npayment or to wait investment; and the idea of appointing a key-keeper\r\nwas that the chest might never be approached by any person at random\r\nor singly, but always by responsible officers, protected against\r\nthemselves by the presence of others.\r\n\r\n(7) The Fellows were strictly required to reside in Oxford and within\r\nCollege. During the Long Vacation they might be absent from College for\r\nsix weeks; at other times not for more than two days, without special\r\nleave: the Rector and Subrector had, however, general directions given\r\nthem in the statutes not to be niggardly in granting leave in cases\r\nwhere the presence of the applicant was required by no College duties.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions of the visitation of the city by the plague, this\r\nrequirement of residence was relaxed; and the Fellows were permitted\r\nto have all their allowances if they lived in common at some place\r\nnear Oxford. Thus, in the pestilence of 1535, commons were allowed to\r\nthe Rector, Subrector, and five Fellows in residence at Launton, for a\r\nfortnight in some cases, for a month in others; and in that of 1538,\r\ncommons were allowed to the Rector, Subrector, and twelve Fellows in\r\nresidence at Gosford (near Kidlington), during a period of no less than\r\nfifteen weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring Elizabeth’s reign, leaves of absence become frequent and\r\ncontinuous, and are practically equivalent to non-residence. The\r\nFellows in this reign, and later, developed a bad habit of asking for\r\nleave when their turn for disputing, or other duties, came round; and\r\nseveral Visitors’ Injunctions are directed against granting leaves\r\nunless a substitute has been provided to perform all duties.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement of the duties of the Fellows, we pass on to discuss\r\ntheir emoluments. These can best be understood if we group them\r\ntogether under separate heads.\r\n\r\n(_a._) Commons (_communiæ_), the weekly allowance for food at the\r\ncommon table in the hall of the College, and at the regular time of\r\nmeals. Rotheram provided that in each week there should be allowed for\r\neach Fellow in residence (counting the Rector as a Fellow), the sum\r\nof sixteen-pence; fixing the allowance at that amount, and not more,\r\nbecause, as he says, “clerks” should avoid luxury.\r\n\r\nSeveral festivals of the Church’s year were to be honoured by an\r\naddition to the ordinary table-allowance. In the weeks in which the\r\nfollowing Holy-days occurred, the allowance for commons for each Fellow\r\nwas to be increased by the sum named:--Epiphany (6th Jan.), 4_d._;\r\nPurification of Mary (Feb. 2nd), 2_d._; _Carnis privium_ (Septuagesima\r\nSunday), 2_d._; Annunciation of Mary (25th Mar.), 2_d._; Easter,\r\n8_d._; Ascension, 4_d._; Whitsun day, 8_d._; Corpus Christi, 4_d._;\r\nSt. Mildred (13th July), 2_d._; Assumption of Mary (15th Aug.), 2_d._;\r\nNativity of Mary (8th Sept.), 2_d._; Michaelmas (29th Sept.), 2_d._;\r\ndedication of St. Michael’s Church (in Oct.), 2_d._; All Saints’ Day\r\n(1st Nov.), 4_d._; dedication of All Saints’ Church (in Nov.), 4_d._;\r\nConception of Mary (8th Dec.), 2_d._; Christmas, 8_d._\r\n\r\nAn incidental, and therefore very striking, indication of the plagues\r\nwhich then infected the country is the care the statutes take to\r\nprovide for cases of leprosy or other noisome disease. The Fellow so\r\nafflicted is to live away from the College, and to receive yearly forty\r\nshillings in lieu of all allowances.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Salary (_salarium_), payments in money. Rotheram made no grants\r\nfor these, except to the Rector and the College officers; but he gave\r\nliberty to other benefactors to make them. The first distinct mention\r\nof such grants is in 1537, when Edmund Darby directs that 3_s._ 4_d._\r\nshall be paid annually to each Fellow, and 6_s._ 8_d._ to the Rector.\r\nThe dividends of the College rents, after payment of all charges, known\r\nas “provision,” date no doubt from a very early period, but their\r\nhistory cannot now be traced.\r\n\r\n(_c._) Livery (_vestura_), allowance for clothing. For this also\r\nRotheram made no provision, except to permit it if given by later\r\nbenefactors. Edmund Audley, Bishop of Sarum, in giving his benefaction\r\nin 1518, directed that forty shillings per annum should be allowed _pro\r\nrobis_ to the Rector, and to each of the four senior Fellows.\r\n\r\n(_d._) The Fellows in common were entitled to the services of the\r\ncommon servants; for which see below.\r\n\r\n(_e._) The Fellows were entitled to have rooms (_cameræ_) rent-free.\r\nThese were to be chosen, according to seniority, on the May chapter.\r\nAbout 1600 we find that along with his room, the Fellow received also\r\nthe attic (“loft,” or “cock-loft”) over it, into which he might put a\r\ntenant from whom he might receive rent. How far this custom had come\r\ndown from antiquity we have no means of saying.\r\n\r\n(_f._) Obits (_obitus_), allowances for being present at Mass on the\r\nanniversary-day of a benefactor. A considerable benefactor invariably\r\nmade a bargain with the College, that his name should be kept in\r\nremembrance, and his soul’s health prayed for in a special Mass, yearly\r\non the anniversary of his death, or, if that should clash with some\r\nvery solemn season of the Church’s year, on the nearest convenient day.\r\nTo insure the presence of the Rector and Fellows, he generally ordered\r\nthat each Fellow present at the Commemoration Service should receive a\r\nstipulated sum, which was called by the same name as the day itself, an\r\n“obit.”\r\n\r\nThe following are the dates of the obits in Lincoln College, and\r\nthe amount paid to each Fellow; the Rector as celebrant, receiving\r\nin each case double the amount which a Fellow received:--Jan. 10th,\r\nEdward Darby, 1_s._; Jan. 16th, Bishop Beckington, 6_d._; Feb. 23rd,\r\nArchdeacon Southam, 1_s._; March 21st, John Crosby, 8_d._; March 26th,\r\nDean Forest, 1_s._; April 11th, Cardinal Beaufort, 8_d._; May 29th,\r\nRotheram, the second founder, 1_s._; Aug. 23rd, Bishop Audley, 1_s._;\r\nOct. 10th, Bishop William Smith, 1_s._; Oct. 29th, William Dagvill,\r\n1_s._; Nov. 16th, William Bate, 6_d._--all of them early benefactors.\r\nThe obit of the first founder, Fleming, was fixed for Jan. 25th; but no\r\nallowances made for it, gratitude alone being strong enough to ensure\r\nthe attendance of all the Fellows.\r\n\r\nAt the Reformation, the celebration of Mass and, consequently, the\r\nobservance of these anniversary services in the form directed by\r\nthe statutes, became illegal, and the chapel services ceased. The\r\nallowances still continued to be paid to each Fellow who was present in\r\nCollege on the particular day, the test of “presence” being now dining\r\nin hall at the ordinary hour of dinner.\r\n\r\n(_g._) Pittances (_pietantia_). Besides the sum given to the Rector and\r\neach Fellow on a benefactor’s anniversary day, it is sometimes directed\r\nthat a sum shall be paid to them in common for “a pittance,” _i. e._\r\nas I suppose, to provide a better dinner on that day. Thus Cardinal\r\nBeaufort gave a pittance of 3_s._ 4_d._; Rotheram, one of 2_s._; Edward\r\nDarby, one of 3_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n(III) The Chaplains were four in number. Two were to serve the churches\r\nof All Saints and St. Michael in Oxford, one of whom must be of the\r\ndiocese of York, the other of the diocese of Lincoln. They were to be\r\nappointed by the Rector, and to be removed by him when he chose; and\r\neach to receive from the College a stipend of £5 per annum. A third\r\nChaplain was to serve the church of Twyford under the same conditions,\r\nexcept that his stipend was to be paid by the Rector; a fourth was to\r\nserve the church of Combe Longa.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly no part of the founder’s intention that the chaplaincies\r\nshould be served by the Fellows: and we find, down to the Civil War\r\nand the Commonwealth, instances of Chaplains who were not Fellows.\r\nBut after the Restoration, when £5 per annum no longer represented a\r\nreasonable year’s income, there was a growing feeling that it was for\r\nthe honour of the College that the duties of Chaplain of All Saints,\r\nSt. Michael’s, and Combe should be undertaken by Fellows. And so long\r\nas there were Fellows in orders enough for the duties, this was done.\r\nIn the last half century, recognizing the changed circumstances of the\r\ntimes, the College has provided a more adequate endowment for each of\r\nits four chaplaincies.\r\n\r\n(IV) The Servants. Rotheram’s statutes provided that the Rector and\r\neach Fellow should have free of charge his share of the services of the\r\n“common” servants (_i. e._ of the College servants). These were (1) the\r\nmanciple, whose duty it was to buy in provisions and distribute them in\r\nCollege; (2) the cook; (3) the barber;[176] (4) the laundress. From an\r\naccount-book of 1591, it appears that the salary of the manciple and of\r\nthe cook was £1 6_s._ 8_d._ per annum; of the barber, 10_s._; and of\r\nthe laundress £2.\r\n\r\nThere was also the bible-clerk (_bibliotista_, contracted _bita_),\r\nwho was to be the Rector’s servant when he was in residence. At\r\ndinner in hall he was to read, from the Bible, or some expositor, or\r\nsome other instructive book, a portion appointed by the Rector or\r\nSubrector; and at dinner and supper he was to wait at the Fellows’\r\ntable. For these services he was to receive food and drink; a room;\r\nand washing and shaving (the latter referring to the tonsure probably,\r\nand not suggesting that he was old enough to grow a beard). Different\r\nbenefactors made additions to his emoluments; and at last, until\r\ndivided by the 1855 statutes into two “Rector’s Scholarships,” the\r\nBible-clerkship was the best paid office in College, being worth three\r\ntimes the Subrectorship, twice the Bursarship, or once and a half a\r\nTutorship.\r\n\r\n(V) The Commoners, or Sojourners (_commensales seu sojornantes_).\r\nAlmost from the first there had been graduates resident in College,\r\nattracted by its quiet and by its social life, but not on the\r\nfoundation, and therefore receiving no allowances from the College.\r\nRotheram’s statutes provided for their discipline, directing that\r\nthey must take part in the disputations of the Fellows, and so on.\r\nUndergraduates are by implication excluded; and this presumption is\r\nincreased to a certainty by the fact that no provision is made in the\r\nstatutes for tuition.\r\n\r\nIn its beginnings, therefore, Lincoln College differs from our modern\r\nconceptions of a College alike in its aims and in its constitution. In\r\nall external features, and partially also in its domestic arrangements,\r\nit resembles a monastic house; but it differs from a convent in two\r\nimportant, though not obvious, points; first, that its inmates are\r\nnot bound by a rule, and are free to depart from the College into\r\nthe wider service of the Church; secondly, that the duty of prayer\r\nfor benefactors and the Christian dead is co-ordinate with two other\r\nduties, the duty of serving certain churches, and the duty of studying\r\nfor study’s sake and for the truth. We have next to inquire how the\r\nCollege changed its original character, and was made, like other Oxford\r\nColleges, a place of residence for undergraduates, with a body of\r\nFellows engaged in tuition. This was one of the indirect results of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nUnder Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth, the old freedom of\r\nthe University was taken away, lest, if the immunities of the place\r\ncontinued, Oxford should become an asylum for disaffected persons.[177]\r\nNo undergraduate was to be allowed in the University, unless he had\r\nthe protection of a graduate tutor; and residence was to be restricted\r\nto residence within the walls of a College or Hall. There was thus\r\nan external pressure forcing undergraduates to enter Colleges. There\r\nwas also a readiness from within the College to receive them. The\r\nproceedings of the Reformers had been a violent shock to the adherents\r\nof the old faith in Lincoln College; and now that the routine of chapel\r\nservices, masses, anniversaries, obits, could no longer be pursued,\r\nthese adherents devoted themselves to training up young students in\r\nopposition to the new movement. And when, under John Underhill (Rector\r\n1577-1590), the College was purged of the old leaven, the pressure\r\nof poverty (which then began to be felt in the University) made the\r\nFellows glad to have undergraduates resident in College to keep up the\r\nestablishment and pay tuition fees.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are no statistics of the stages of this change:\r\nthe intervals between the years in which statements of the numbers\r\nin College occur being too great. In 1552 there were in College, the\r\nRector, eleven Fellows, one B.A. Commoner, and thirteen persons not\r\ngraduates, of whom some were certainly servitors, and some probably\r\nservants. In 1575 the Rector and the greater part of the Fellows\r\nhave undergraduate pupils assigned to them in grammar and logic. In\r\n1588 there were in College, the Rector and twelve Fellows, sixteen\r\nundergraduate Commoners, and nine servitors. In 1746, there were\r\nthe Rector and twelve Fellows, eight Gentlemen-commoners, eighteen\r\nCommoners, and eight Servitors.\r\n\r\nWhat provision was made for their instruction?\r\n\r\nFrom about 1592 the College appointed annually these instructors\r\nfor its undergraduates: (_a_) two “Moderators,” to preside over the\r\ndisputations in “Philosophy” and in “Logic” (occasionally when the\r\nCollege was full, an additional “Moderator” was appointed in Logic);\r\n(_b_) a Catechist, or theological instructor. Also, from 1615, a\r\nlecturer in Greek, annually appointed, was added. Of these the\r\ncatechetical lecture disappears after 1642; the others continued to\r\nbe annually filled up till 1856, but for many years these had been\r\nmerely nominal appointments, the work of tuition devolving on regularly\r\nappointed Tutors, as in other Colleges. But at what date these last had\r\nbeen introduced into Lincoln College, is nowhere stated. In some few\r\nyears, exceptional appointments are made; as, for example, in 1624 a\r\nFellow is appointed to teach Hebrew; in 1708, £6 per annum is paid to\r\nPhilip Levi, the Hebrew master.\r\n\r\nAmong these lecturers two may be noted. In 1607, and again in 1609 and\r\n1610, Robert Sanderson was Logic lecturer; and began that vigorous\r\ncourse of Logic, which was published in 1615, and long dominated the\r\nSchools of Oxford: indeed, its indirect influence survived into the\r\npresent half century, if, as Rector Tatham wrote to Dean Cyril Jackson,\r\n“Aldrich’s logic is cribbed from Sanderson’s.” In 1615 Sanderson was\r\nCatechist, and perhaps at that time turned his attention to those\r\nquestions of casuistry, in which he was to gain enduring fame. John\r\nWesley was appointed to give the Logic and Greek lectures in 1727,\r\n1728, 1730; and the Philosophy and Greek lectures in 1731, 1732, and\r\n1733.\r\n\r\nWhat provision was made for the maintenance of undergraduates in the\r\nCollege?\r\n\r\nIn 1568, Mrs. Joan Traps, widow of Robert Traps, goldsmith of London,\r\nbequeathed to the College lands at Whitstable in Kent for the\r\nmaintenance of four poor scholars. One scholar was to be nominated\r\nfrom Sandwich School by the Mayor and Jurats of that town, but not\r\nto be admitted unless the College thought him fit; in defect of such\r\nnomination, Lincoln College was to fill this place up (as it did\r\nthe other three) from any grammar school in England. Each of these\r\nfour scholars was to receive fifty-three shillings and fourpence\r\nhalf-yearly. Mrs. Traps was also, in her husband’s name, a benefactor\r\nto Caius College, Cambridge, in which College their portraits hang.\r\nDescendants of R. Traps’ brother are still found in Lancashire,\r\nCatholics; and one of them has told me his belief that the Traps had\r\nbought Church lands at the dissolution of the monasteries, intending\r\nto return them to the Church when the nation was again settled on its\r\nold lines; but this hope failing, devoted them to education,[178] as\r\nso many other conscientious purchasers of Church lands did. If this\r\nbe so, it is fitting that the first recorded Traps’ Scholar, William\r\nHarte (elected 25th May, 1571), should have been one of those sufferers\r\nfor the old faith, whose cruel and barbarous murders are so dark a\r\nstain on the “spacious times” of Elizabeth. Mrs. Joyce Frankland,\r\ndaughter of the Traps, augmented the stipend of these “scholars.” She\r\nwas afterwards a considerable benefactress to Brasenose College, and a\r\nmost munificent donor to Caius College, Cambridge. Is she also to be\r\nnumbered among those “offended benefactors” who have been mentioned\r\nabove? Or had Lincoln College in her time been “reformed”? These four\r\nTraps’ scholars,[179] commonly called the “Scholars of the House”\r\n(being distinguished, as I suppose, by that name from the servitors\r\nmaintained privately by any Fellow), were for a century the only\r\nundergraduates in Lincoln College in receipt of any endowment.\r\n\r\nIn 1640, Thomas Hayne left £6 per annum in trust to the corporation\r\nof Leicester for the maintenance of two scholars in Lincoln College\r\nto be elected by the Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen of that city. The\r\ncorporation received this benefaction, but never sent any scholar to\r\nthe College. Numerous educational benefactions throughout England were\r\nlost, like this, in the anarchy of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn 1655, a Chancery suit was begun against Anthony Foxcrofte, who had\r\ndestroyed a codicil of Charles Greenwood, Rector of Thornhill and\r\nWakefield, by which two Fellowships (or perhaps Scholarships) were\r\nbestowed on Lincoln College. What the issue of the suit was, I cannot\r\nsay; nothing, certainly, came to the College.\r\n\r\nAbout 1670, Edmund Parboe left a rent-charge of £10 per annum issuing\r\nout of the Pelican Inn in Sandwich, of which £4 was to be paid to the\r\nmaster of the grammar-school there, £1 to the Mayor and Juratts for\r\nwine “when they keep their ordinary there,” £5 to Lincoln College for\r\nthe increase of the scholarship from Sandwich school; if no scholar is\r\nin College, it is to be funded till one is sent, and the arrears paid\r\nto him. From that date the corporation of Sandwich never nominated a\r\nscholar. I suspect the Mayor and Juratts treated the £5, like the £1,\r\nas a _pour boire_.\r\n\r\nMay the College still hope that the towns of Leicester and Sandwich, or\r\nsome one for them, will remember the long arrears of these endowments,\r\nthus diverted from education? Even at simple interest, they would be\r\nnow a great benefaction; and at compound interest, how great!\r\n\r\nLater Scholarships and Exhibitions were founded by Rectors Marshall\r\n(four, in 1688), Crewe (twelve, 1717), Hutchins (several, 1781),\r\nRadford (several, 1851); also by Mrs. Tatham, widow of Rector Tatham\r\n(one, 1847). In 1857, Henry Usher Matthews, formerly Commoner of the\r\nCollege, founded a Scholarship in Lincoln College, and an Exhibition\r\nin Shrewsbury School to be held in Lincoln College: but the Public\r\nSchools Commissioners unjustly took the latter from the College. Since\r\nthat date no Scholarship benefaction has come to the College; but\r\nScholarships and Exhibitions have been created from time to time, under\r\nthe provisions of the Statutes of 1855, out of suspended Fellowships.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this change in the aims of the College has led us\r\nbeyond the point to which we had come in its annals; it is therefore\r\nnecessary to go back, and pass rapidly in review its post-Reformation\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nJohn Cottisford, the eighth Rector of the College (elected in March\r\n1518-19), resigned on 7th Jan., 1538-9, probably[180] in dismay at the\r\ncourse of events in the nation. His successor, Hugh Weston, elected on\r\n8th Jan., was possibly supposed to be on the reforming side; for he was\r\nundisturbed by Edward VI.’s Commissioners; but had to resign in 1555\r\nto the Visitors appointed by Cardinal Pole. Christopher Hargreaves,\r\nelected on 24th Aug., 1555, and confirmed in his place by Cardinal\r\nPole’s Visitors, died on 15th Oct., 1558. His successor, Henry Henshaw\r\nor Heronshaw, was hardly elected on 24th Oct., when the hopes of the\r\nRomanist party were shattered. The College register, in the greatness\r\nof its anxiety, breaks, on this one occasion, the silence it observes\r\nas to affairs outside the College.[181] “In the year of our Lord 1558,\r\nin November, died the lady of most holy memory, Mary, Queen of England,\r\nand Reginald Poole, Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury; the body\r\nof the former was buried in Westminster, the body of the latter in\r\nhis cathedral church of Canterbury, both on the same day, namely 14th\r\nDecember. At this date the following were Rector and Fellows of Lincoln\r\nCollege,” and then follows a list of them. Clearly the writer of this\r\nnote did not look forward to remaining long in College. Nor did he;\r\nwithin two years Henshaw had to resign to Queen Elizabeth’s Visitors.\r\nFrancis Babington, who had just been made Master of Balliol by these\r\nVisitors, was transferred to the Rectorship of Lincoln. In this\r\nappointment we can detect the sinister influence which was to direct\r\nelections at Lincoln for some time to come; Babington was chaplain\r\nto Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Chancellor of the University\r\nafter 1564. The election was in flagrant violation of the Statutes\r\nwhich required that the Rector should be chosen from the Fellows or\r\nex-Fellows of the College. But it was the policy of the Court to break\r\nCollege traditions, by thrusting outsiders into the chief government:\r\nthe same thing was done in other Colleges, the case of Lincoln being\r\npeculiar only in the frequency of the intrusion. Doubts began to be\r\ncast on Babington’s sincerity; he was accused of secretly favouring\r\nRomanism; and in 1563 he found it advisable to betake himself beyond\r\nsea.[182] Leicester was ready with another of his chaplains, John\r\nBridgwater, who had been Fellow of Brasenose, and was not statutably\r\neligible for the Rectorship of Lincoln. Again the Court was mistaken in\r\nits man. Under Bridgwater the College became a Romanist seminary, and\r\ncontinued so for eleven years; and then Bridgwater had to follow his\r\npredecessor across the seas, retiring to Douay, where, Latinising his\r\nname into “Aquapontanus,” he became famous as a theologian. He is still\r\nheld in honour among his co-religionists, and I remember several visits\r\npaid to the College in recent years by admirers of his, in hopes of\r\nseeing a portrait of him (but the College has none) or his handwriting\r\n(which we have). Still another of his chaplains was thrust into Lincoln\r\nCollege by the over-powerful Leicester; this time John Tatham, Fellow\r\nof Merton. But Tatham’s Rectorship was destined to be a brief one:\r\nelected in July 1574, he was buried in All Saints’ Church on 20th Nov.,\r\n1576.\r\n\r\nThen there took place a very remarkable contest, six candidates\r\nseeking the Rectorship. Only one, John Gibson, Fellow since 1571, was\r\nstatutably qualified; although of only six years’ standing as a Fellow\r\nhe was still senior Fellow, a fact eloquent as to the removal of the\r\nolder Fellows from the College. Edmund Lilly, of Magd. Coll., another\r\ncandidate, relied apparently on his popularity in the University.\r\nThe other four candidates relied on compulsion from outside, William\r\nWilson, of Mert. Coll., being recommended by the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, while the Chancellor (Lord Leicester) and the Bishops of\r\nLincoln and Rochester tried to secure the election of their respective\r\nChaplains. Leicester’s candidate, John Underhill, was specially\r\nunacceptable to the College, having been removed from his Fellowship at\r\nNew College by the Bishop of Winchester (the Visitor there), because\r\nof some malpractices with the College moneys. The Fellows elected John\r\nGibson; the Bishop of Lincoln refused to admit him. Leicester wrote\r\nthreatening letters to the College; summoned several of the Fellows to\r\nLondon, and browbeat them there. Then, thinking he had now gained his\r\npoint, he proceeded to frighten off the other candidates, in order to\r\nleave a clear field for Underhill. The Fellows again elected Gibson;\r\nand the Bishop of Lincoln again refused to admit him. Then the Fellows\r\nelected Wilson; but the Bishop refused to admit him. So that, there\r\nbeing no help for it, they met again on 22nd June, 1577, and elected\r\nUnderhill.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings caused great indignation in the University; and a\r\npetition was drawn up, worded in very strong terms, entreating the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury to undertake the defence of the University\r\nagainst the “iniquity, wrong, and violence” which had been done. This\r\nwas signed by resident B.D.’s and M.A.’s, and presented to his Grace,\r\nwho passed it on to Leicester. Leicester thereupon wrote a long letter\r\nto Convocation, trying to justify his action, and threatening to resign\r\nhis Chancellorship of the University if further attacked in this matter.\r\n\r\nUnderhill’s first step after his election was to begin a new register,\r\nand to tear out of the old register all records of the proceedings\r\nsince the death of Tatham; so that the only entry in the College\r\nbooks concerning this controversy is that Underhill was “unanimously\r\nelected.” Leicester visited the College in 1585, and the Latin\r\ncongratulatory verses on that occasion are among the earliest printed\r\nof Oxford contributions to that particularly dull form of literature.\r\nUnderhill remained rector till 1590. By that time the see of Oxford\r\nhad been vacant twenty years; and, as the leases of the episcopal\r\nestates were running out, Sir Francis Walsingham required a bishop who\r\nwould make new leases and give him a share of the fines. He selected\r\nUnderhill for this purpose, who was consecrated Bishop of Oxford in\r\nDecember 1589, and resigned the Rectorship of the College in 1590. His\r\npatron, having no further use for him after the renewal of the leases,\r\nneglected him; and Underhill died in poverty and disgrace in May 1592.\r\n\r\nLeicester being now dead, the College at this vacancy was left to\r\nchoose its own head; and Richard Kilby, Fellow since 1578, was elected\r\nsixteenth rector on 10th December, 1590. Kilby’s Rectorship proved one\r\ncontinuous domestic struggle, which has left its mark in the College\r\nregister in scored-out pages and blotted entries, as plainly as an\r\nactual battle leaves its mark in fields of grain trampled down by\r\ncontending armies. The question was about the number of Fellows. In\r\nUnderhill’s Rectorship the College appears to have been impoverished,\r\nand unable to pay the full body of Fellows their allowances. Kilby’s\r\npolicy was to leave the Fellowships vacant, in order to keep up the\r\nincome of the present holders; the opposition in College desired to\r\nfill up the Fellowships and to submit to a reduction of stipend all\r\nround.\r\n\r\nIn April 1592 the number of Fellows had fallen to nine. On 24th April\r\nthree Fellows were elected; this election was quashed by the Visitor\r\non 8th December of the same year. But the Fellows returned to the\r\ncharge, and elected three Fellows on 15th December, and five others\r\non 16th December, 1592; so that in 1593 the College consists of the\r\nRector and the full number of Fellows (_i. e._ fifteen). Vacancies\r\noccur rapidly, the Fellowships being so small in value. In 1596, and\r\nagain in 1599, elections of one Fellow are made, are appealed against,\r\nbut confirmed by the Visitor. In 1600 the number of Fellows had again\r\nfallen as low as ten, and the Fellows wished to proceed to an election;\r\nbut the Rector (Kilby) tried to prevent their doing so by retiring to\r\nthe country. The Subrector, (Edmund Underhill) called a meeting, and\r\non 3rd November, 1600, the Fellows, in the Rector’s absence, elected\r\ninto two vacancies. Kilby induced the Visitor to quash these elections;\r\nEdmund Underhill appealed to the Archbishop of Canterbury as primate of\r\nthe southern province. This was against the statutes, which directed\r\nthat no Fellow should invoke any other judge than the Visitor; and on\r\nthis ground, on 4th May, 1602, Kilby procured Underhill’s expulsion.\r\nAt the end of 1605 there were only five Fellows remaining; by 2nd May,\r\n1606, two more had resigned. On the next day the Rector and the three\r\nFellows remaining elected eight new Fellows, the last of the eight\r\nbeing certainly not the least, but the most illustrious Lincoln name of\r\nthe century, Robert Sanderson, the prince of casuists.\r\n\r\nThe years which follow, from this election to the breaking out of\r\nthe Civil War, present two aspects. Externally tokens of prosperity\r\nare not wanting. The buildings were considerably increased. In 1610\r\nSir Thomas Rotheram, probably the same who had been Fellow from 1586\r\nto 1593 and Bursar[183] in 1592, and apparently of kin to the second\r\nFounder,[184] built the west side of the chapel quadrangle. The chapel\r\nitself, with its beautiful glass (said to be the work of an artist\r\nAbbott, brother of the Archbishop), was the gift of John Williams,\r\nBishop of Lincoln and Visitor of the College. Bishop Williams at the\r\nsame time (1628-1631) built the east side of the chapel quadrangle. The\r\nwork cost more than he had promised to give, and the College had to\r\ncomplete it at its own charges; £90 being spent on this work in 1629,\r\n“as being all the sum that my lord our benefactor did require or the\r\nCollege could spare.” It is curious to find[185] the same benefactor\r\ndoing exactly the same thing in the fixed sum he gave (and would not\r\nincrease) for building the library at St. John’s College in Cambridge.\r\nIf we turn, however, to the domestic annals of the College during\r\nthis period we find an unlovely picture of turbulence and disorder.\r\nFellows and Commoners alike are accused of boorish insolence, of\r\nswinish intemperance, of quarrelling and fighting. Bursars mismanage\r\ntheir trust and fail to render account of the College moneys they have\r\nreceived. Fellows try to defraud the College by marrying in secret and\r\nretaining their Fellowships. Two or three of the less scandalous scenes\r\nwill be sufficient to indicate the violence of the times. On 20th\r\nNovember, 1634, Thomas Goldsmith, B.A., had to read a public apology in\r\nchapel for “a most cruel and barbarous assault” on William Carminow, an\r\nundergraduate. In December 1634 Thomas Smith, an M.A. commoner, made\r\n“a desperate and barbarous assault” on Nicholas North, another M.A.\r\ncommoner, in the room of the latter. The same Thomas Smith a month\r\nbefore had been ordered by the Rector “to take his dogs[186] out of the\r\nCollege,” which order he had treated with contempt. In October 1636\r\nRichard Kilby and John Webberley, two Fellows, fell out and fought; and\r\n“Mr. Kilbye’s face was sore bruised and beaten.” The College ordered\r\nWebberley “to pay the charge of the surgeon for healing of Mr. Kilbye’s\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nWe must pass very hastily over the period from 1641 to the Restoration,\r\nnot because the annals of Lincoln are lacking in interest during\r\nthese years, but because space presses and the chief incidents have\r\nbeen noted in Wood’s _History of the University_ and in Burrows’\r\n_Register of the Parliamentary Visitation_. Paul Hood, the Rector,\r\nbeing a Puritan, kept his place under the Commonwealth, and having\r\nbeen constitutionally elected before the Civil War, retained it at the\r\nRestoration. Ten Fellows were ejected by the Parliamentary Visitors,\r\nand ten put into their place, at least six of them being persons of\r\nunsatisfactory character. At the Restoration Hood got the King’s\r\nCommissioners to eject those of the ten who remained, and seven Fellows\r\nwere elected in their place, the only name of interest among these\r\nbeing that of Henry Foulis, famous in his own age for his violent and\r\nbulky invectives against Presbyterianism and Romanism.\r\n\r\nLincoln College was singularly fortunate during the latter half of\r\nthe seventeenth and for the greater part of the eighteenth centuries.\r\nHood, at the Restoration, was in extreme old age, and left the whole\r\nmanagement of the College to Nathaniel Crewe (Subrector 1664-1668),\r\nso that it fairly escaped the break-down in manners, morals, and\r\nstudies which the Restoration brought to many Colleges. Crewe, after\r\na short Rectorship of four years (1668-1672), was raised to the\r\nEpiscopal Bench; and at the close of his long life proved our greatest\r\nbenefactor. When he resigned Crewe used his influence to get Thomas\r\nMarshall elected Rector, a good scholar and a good governor; who, on\r\nhis death in 1685, left his estate to the College. His successor,\r\nFitz-herbert Adams, was also a considerable benefactor. Of John Morley\r\nand Euseby Isham, who followed, John Wesley speaks in the highest\r\nterms. Richard Hutchins, twenty-third Rector (1755-1781), was a model\r\ndisciplinarian and an excellent man of business; and, following\r\nMarshall’s example, left his estate for the endowment of scholarships.\r\n\r\nDuring this happy period much was done to improve the College, which\r\ncan only be touched on in the briefest outline here. In 1662 John Lord\r\nCrewe of Steane (father of Nathaniel) converted the old chapel--which\r\nsince the consecration of the new chapel on 15th September, 1631,\r\nhad lain empty--into a library, which it still remains, and changed\r\nthe library into a set of rooms. In 1662 the room under the library\r\nwestwards was set aside as a room where the Fellows might have their\r\ncommon fires and hold their College meetings;[187] it is still the\r\nFellows’ morning-room. In 1684 the common-room was wainscotted at a\r\ncost of £90, Dr. John Radcliffe subscribing £10, and George Hickes\r\nand John Kettlewell each £5. In 1686 Fitz-herbert Adams spent £470\r\non repairing and beautifying the chapel. In 1697-1700 the hall was\r\nwainscotted at a cost of £270, to which Lord Crewe gave £100. Rector\r\nHutchins bought from Magdalen College some of the houses between the\r\nCollege and All Saints’ Church, and left money to purchase the others,\r\nso as to form the present College garden.\r\n\r\nDuring this period also the roll of the Fellows received some of its\r\nmore famous names. The two eminent non-jurors, George Hickes and John\r\nKettlewell; the celebrated physician, John Radcliffe; John Potter,\r\nwhose Greek scholarship promoted him to the see of Canterbury; and John\r\nWesley,[188] by and by to win a name only less famous than that of\r\nWycliffe in the history of religion in England, may be cited.\r\n\r\nThe long period of prosperity which Lincoln College had enjoyed\r\nduring the later part of the seventeenth and the earlier part of the\r\neighteenth centuries was followed in the end of the eighteenth and the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth centuries by a period of decline, during\r\nwhich the College had its full share in the general stagnation of the\r\nUniversity, and was chiefly notable for the grotesque eccentricities\r\nof its rector, Edward Tatham (Rector 1792-1834). Tatham, an M.A. of\r\nQueen’s College, had been elected into a Yorkshire Fellowship at\r\nLincoln in 1782. Shortly after his election he came into conflict with\r\nthe Rector (John Horner) over a number of points in the interpretation\r\nof the statutes; and after several appeals to the Visitor, was\r\nsuccessful in his contention. In 1790 he distinguished himself by the\r\nponderous learning, and the vigorous, if coarse, style of his Bampton\r\nLectures, _The Chart and Scale of Truth by which to find the cause\r\nof Error_ (published in 1790 in two volumes; a copy in the College\r\nlibrary has additional MS. notes by the author). In March 1792 he was\r\nelected Rector, and one of his first achievements was the use he made\r\nof his old practice in controversy over the statutes to obtain from\r\nthe Visitor an unstatutable augmentation of the stipend of the Rector.\r\nIn the old obits, the Rector, being celebrant, had been assigned\r\ndouble the allowance of any Fellow; and in elections, according to an\r\nalmost universal custom in Oxford Colleges, his vote counted for two.\r\nBy emphasizing these points and suppressing contradictory evidence,\r\nTatham persuaded the Visitor to decree that for the future the Rector’s\r\nFellowship should receive double of _all_ the allowances of an ordinary\r\nFellowship. Tatham was known as a forcible but most unconventional\r\npreacher; and one phrase of his, used in the University pulpit,[189]\r\nhas become almost proverbial, that namely in which he wished that “all\r\nthe Jarman[190] philosophers were at the bottom of the Jarman ocean,”\r\nforgetting in the heat of his rhetoric to make it plain to his audience\r\nwhether he meant the writers or their writings. In University business\r\nTatham was at war with the Hebdomadal Board, and used to brow-beat its\r\nmembers, accusing them of “intrigues, cabals, and subterfuges.” He was\r\ntherefore well-hated by many of his contemporaries, and a great subject\r\nof those pasquils and lampoons which, orally and in writing, circulated\r\nfreely in the University. In several of these Tatham had been compared\r\nin features and disposition to the “devil,” who, after the fashion of\r\nthe similar grotesque at Lincoln Cathedral, “looked over Lincoln” from\r\nhis niche on the quadrangle-side of the gate-tower. Irritated at this,\r\nTatham ordered the leaden figure to be taken down.[191] Then came out\r\na lampoon, longer and more bitter than any before, in which the wit\r\nconsists in making the word “devil” occur as often as possible in every\r\nquatrain, and the point is to suggest that when Tatham was returning\r\nfrom dining out (“full of politics, learning, and port was his pate”)\r\nthe devil, tired of standing so long inactive, had flown off with him\r\ninto space; where leaving him, the devil returned to establish himself\r\nin person in the Rectorship and to govern the College with the help of\r\n“two imps, called tutors.” During the later years of his life Tatham\r\navailed himself of the large liberty of non-residence allowed the\r\nRector by the then statutes, and lived chiefly in the rectory-house at\r\nCombe. There he enjoyed the pleasures of a rough country life, farming\r\nthe glebe, and devoting himself with marked success to the rearing\r\nof his special breed of pigs. He rarely visited Oxford; and when he\r\ndid, always brought with him in his dog-cart a pair of his pigs to be\r\nexposed for sale in the pig-market, which was then held in High Street\r\nbeside All Saints Church. On these occasions his dress is described by\r\na contemporary to have been so strictly in keeping with his favourite\r\npursuit that he ran no risk of being mistaken for a Doctor of Divinity\r\nor the head of a College. There was, however, one occasion on which\r\nTatham came out in his “scarlet,” with great effect. The College had\r\nsome rights in the naming of the master of Skipton Grammar School,\r\nYorkshire. On occasion of a vacancy the local governors were disposed\r\nto dispute the claim. Tatham went north, at the previous stage put on\r\nhis Doctor’s robes, drove into Skipton attired in their splendour, and\r\ndazzled the opposition into acknowledging the College claim. He died on\r\n24th April, 1834, aged 84.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, Lincoln College did not prosper during Tatham’s\r\nrectorship. A scholarship was lost. Sir George Wheler, a Commoner\r\nof the College, had left in 1719 a yearly rent-charge of £10 on a\r\nhouse in St. Margaret’s parish, Westminster, to certain trustees “to\r\npay to a poor scholar in Lincoln College that shall have been bred\r\nup in the grammar school at Wye.” From 1735 to 1759 no payment was\r\nmade; and then the Rev. Granville Wheler, in recognition of arrears,\r\nincreased the rent-charge to £20, and directed that if no boy was sent\r\nfrom Wye, the scholarship should be open to any grammar school in\r\nEngland. In Horner’s and Tatham’s time the matter was neglected; and\r\nthe benefaction is now for ever lost to the College. Again, part of\r\nthe money received from the city in payment for the grand old College\r\ngarden, which by Act of Parliament was taken to form the present\r\nMarket, was invested in Government securities; but the books were so\r\ncarelessly kept that the exact details required by the Exchequer could\r\nnot afterwards be collected from them: so that part of the property of\r\nLincoln College is amongst those “unclaimed” dividends out of which the\r\nnew Law Courts were built. It is surely unjust that the nation should\r\nthus make a College suffer for the negligence of one generation of its\r\nofficers. There was also great degeneracy in the _personnel_ of the\r\nCollege. Oxford was then passing through that phase of hard-drinking\r\nwhich within living memory still afflicted society in country places;\r\nand from this vice Lincoln College was not exempt. Several of the\r\nFellows had curacies or small livings in the neighbourhood of Oxford,\r\nto which they rode out, as represented in a well-known cartoon of the\r\ntime, on Saturday morning, returning to the College on Monday. On\r\nMonday evening, therefore, they were all met together, and preparations\r\nwere made for a “wet night.” When the Fellows entered Common-room after\r\nHall, a bottle of port was standing on the side-board for each of their\r\nnumber. These finished there would be a second (and as liberal) supply,\r\nand very probably after that several of them would slip out to bring an\r\nextra bottle from their private stores. Two instances of the _corruptio\r\noptimi_ of the times--the degradation of men who had received a\r\nUniversity education--may be cited. A Fellow of Lincoln College got\r\ninto debt, and his Fellowship was sequestrated by his creditors, who\r\nallowed him a small pittance out of its proceeds, and applied the rest\r\nto the liquidation of his debts; he became an ordinary tramp, and died\r\nin the casual ward at Northampton, after holding his Fellowship for\r\ntwenty-five years. An ex-Fellow, incumbent of one of the more distant\r\nand valuable College livings, got, by his own extravagance, into the\r\nclutches of the money-lenders, who sequestrated his living and confined\r\nhim in Oxford Debtors’ prison, where he remained year after year\r\ntill his death. When, in 1854, the new incumbent went to the living,\r\nhe found that the parishioners, unable to get anything out of their\r\nRector, had helped themselves from the Rectory-house; windows, doors,\r\nstaircases, floors, slates, stones had been taken away, and the ruins,\r\nsold at auction, fetched less than £10.\r\n\r\nThe tuition in College became of the meanest and poorest stamp. The\r\npublic lectures consisted in the lecturer hearing the men translate\r\nwithout comment a few lines of Virgil or Homer in the morning; and the\r\ninformal instruction was equally paltry. One story of a Lincoln tutor\r\nof the time may be set down here, though it is probably exceptional\r\nand not typical. The narrator, an Archdeacon, “Venerable” not only\r\nby title but by years, said--“I was pupil to Mr. ----, and I did not\r\naltogether approve of his method of tuition. His method, sir, was this:\r\nI read through with him the greater part of the second extant decade of\r\nLivy, in which, as you are aware, the name of Hannibal not infrequently\r\noccurs. There was a bottle of port on the table; and whenever we came\r\nto the name of that Carthaginian general, my tutor would replenish\r\nhis glass, saying, ‘Here’s that old fellow again; we must drink his\r\nhealth,’ never failing to suit the action to the word.”\r\n\r\nAn odd incident has to be told in connection with Tatham’s death. An\r\nexamination previous to an election to a Lincoln county Fellowship\r\nhad been duly announced, and on 24th April, 1834, the candidates were\r\nassembled in Hall waiting for the first paper. The opinion of his\r\ncontemporaries had singled out Henry Robert Harrison of Lincoln as the\r\nfavourite candidate, and it was, therefore, with some satisfaction\r\nthat the other candidates learned from one of their own number, that\r\nthe coach coming from Leicester had been overturned the day before,\r\nand that Harrison, who was an outside passenger by it, had had his leg\r\nbroken, and would be unable to appear. The paper was now given out,\r\nand they set to it with zest; but before they had finished it a Fellow\r\ncame in with a grave face, told them that a messenger had brought\r\nword that the Rector had died that morning at Combe, and that, as the\r\nCollege could not proceed to an election till after a new Rector had\r\nbeen elected, the Fellows had decided to postpone the examination.\r\nAfter Radford’s election the usual notice was given of the Fellowship\r\nexamination; Harrison was now able to come to it; and on 5th July,\r\n1834, he was elected.\r\n\r\nMention may also be made of an undergraduate of Lincoln College at this\r\ntime who was famous beyond any undergraduate of his own or subsequent\r\nyears. Robert Montgomery, then in the full enjoyment of the reputation\r\nof being the great poet of the century, a reputation evinced by the\r\nsale of thousands of copies of his poems, and unassailed as yet by any\r\nwhisper of adverse criticism, entered the College as Commoner on 18th\r\nFeb., 1830. Although he put himself down in the Bible-Clerk’s book\r\nas son of “Robert Montgomery, esquire,” he was really of very poor\r\nparentage, and was able to come to the University only by the profits\r\nof his pen. His undergraduate contemporaries, whether because they\r\nbelieved it or not, used to assert that he was the son of Gomerie, a\r\nwell-known clown of the day. He was mercilessly persecuted in College.\r\nSome of the forms of this persecution were little creditable to the\r\npersecutors, and had best be left unrecorded; but one instance of a\r\npractical joke on the victim’s egregious vanity may be noted. When\r\nabout to enter for “Smalls” in his first term, he was persuaded to go\r\nto the Vice-Chancellor and request that a special decree should be\r\nproposed putting off his _vivâ-voce_ till late in the vacation, “to\r\navoid the inconveniences likely to be caused by the crowds which might\r\nbe expected to attend the examination of that distinguished poet.”\r\nMontgomery took a fourth class in “Literæ Humaniores” in 1834, and was\r\nafterwards minister of Percy Chapel in London, which members of the\r\nCollege used occasionally to attend to listen to his florid but not\r\nineffective preaching.\r\n\r\nJohn Radford, who had succeeded Tatham as Rector in 1834, was succeeded\r\nin 1851 by James Thompson, and Thompson by Mark Pattison in 1861.\r\nBoth these elections were keenly, not to say bitterly, contested,\r\nwith a partizan spirit which has found its way into several pamphlets\r\nand memoirs; but when the present Rector, W. W. Merry, the thirtieth\r\nwho has ruled over the College, was elected in 1884, the College\r\nRegister once more recorded an election made “_unanimi consensu omnium\r\nsuffragantium_.” He had been Fellow and Lecturer since 1859; and by his\r\neditions of Homer and Aristophanes, had charmed wider circles of pupils\r\nthan that of the College lecture-room.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of the future historian of Lincoln College\r\nto mention with all honour the persons by whom, in these later\r\nRectorships, the College has reasserted its good name, which in the\r\nbeginning of the century had been somewhat tarnished; but for the\r\npresent the gratitude of members of the Society to these must remain\r\nunexpressed in words; most of them are still alive, and we must not\r\npraise them to their face. Of Radford, however, this much may be said,\r\nthat though not a strong governor, his care for the College, and\r\nhis munificence to it, well earned his portrait its place among the\r\nbenefactors in the College hall, and the inscription on his stone in\r\nAll Saints Church, which says that he “dearly loved his College.”\r\n\r\nOne effect of Radford’s bounty must, however, be regretted. Under\r\nhis will the sum of £300 was expended in putting battlements on the\r\nouter (and the earliest) quadrangle of the College, so destroying its\r\nmonastic appearance, and giving to it a castellated air foreign to the\r\ntime of its building and alien to its traditions. This was the last\r\nstep in a process of injudicious repair, which beginning about 1819\r\nhad robbed the buildings of their quaintness and individuality. Recent\r\nwork has been more reverent for the past. In 1889 the College removed\r\nthe lath-and-plaster wagon-roof in the hall and restored to view the\r\nfine chestnut timbers of the original building. The liberality of\r\nresident and non-resident members of the College has in the present\r\nyear provided a fund to complete this restoration of the hall, and to\r\nrecover in 1891 something of the grace which it possessed in 1435, but\r\nlost in 1699.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nALL SOULS COLLEGE.[192]\r\n\r\nBY C. W. C. OMAN, M.A., FELLOW OF ALL SOULS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Chichele, the son of a merchant of Higham Ferrars, was one of\r\nthe first roll of scholars whom William of Wykeham nominated at the\r\nopening of his great foundation of New College. He left Oxford with the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Laws, and soon found both ecclesiastical preferment\r\nand a lucrative legal practice. He attached himself to the House of\r\nLancaster, and served Henry IV. so well that he was made Bishop of St.\r\nDavids, and sent to represent England at the Council of Pisa. In such\r\nfavour did he stand at Court, that when Thomas Arundel, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, died in the first year of Henry V., the young king\r\nappointed Chichele to succeed him.\r\n\r\nFor the long term of thirty years Henry Chichele held the Primacy of\r\nall England, and played no small part in the governance of the realm.\r\nThe two main characteristics of his policy, whatever may be urged in\r\nhis defence, were most unfortunate: he was a stout supporter of the\r\nunhappy war with France, and he was a weak defender of the liberties of\r\nthe Church of England against Papal aggression. History remembers him\r\nas the ambassador who urged so hotly the preposterous claims of Henry\r\nV. on the French throne, and as the first Primate who refused to accept\r\nthe Archbishopric from the King and the Chapter, till he had obtained a\r\ndispensation and a Bull of Provision from the Pope.\r\n\r\nHowever great may have been his faults as a statesman, Chichele (like\r\nhis successor Laud) was throughout his life a liberal and consistent\r\npatron of the University. He presented it with money and books, and,\r\nmindful of what he owed to his training at New College, resolved to\r\ncopy his old master Wykeham in erecting one more well-ordered and\r\nwell-endowed house of learning, among the obscure and ill-managed halls\r\nwhich still harboured the majority of the members of the University.\r\nHe first began to build a small College in St. Giles’; but this\r\ninstitution--St. Bernard’s as it was called--he handed over unfinished\r\nto the Cistercian monks, in whose possession it remained till the\r\nReformation, when it became the nucleus round which Sir Thomas White\r\nbuilt up his new foundation of St. John’s.\r\n\r\nChichele’s later and more serious scheme for establishing a College\r\nwas not taken up till 1437, when he had occupied the Archiepiscopal\r\nsee for twenty-three years, and was already past the age of seventy.\r\nIt was one of the darkest moments of the wretched French war; the\r\ngreat Duke of Bedford had died two years before, and Paris had been\r\nfor twelve months in the hands of the French. The old Archbishop, all\r\nwhose heart had been in the struggle, and who knew that he himself was\r\nmore responsible for its commencement than any other subject of the\r\nCrown, must have spent his last years in unceasing regrets. Perhaps\r\nhe may have felt some personal remorse when he reflected on his own\r\npart in the furthering of the war, but certainly--whether he felt his\r\nresponsibility or not--the waste of English lives during the last\r\ntwenty years lay heavy on his soul. Hence it came that his new college\r\nbecame a chantry as well as a place of education--the inmates were to\r\nbe devoted as well _ad orandum_ as _ad studendum_--hence also, we can\r\nhardly doubt, came its name. For, as its charter drawn by Henry VI.\r\nproceeds to recite--the prayers of the community were to be devoted,\r\n“not only for our welfare and that of our godfather the Archbishop,\r\nwhile alive, and for our souls when we shall have gone from this light,\r\nbut also for the souls of the most illustrious Prince Henry, late\r\nKing of England, of Thomas late Duke of Clarence our uncle, of the\r\nDukes, Earls, Barons, Knights, Esquires, and other noble subjects of\r\nour father and ourself who fell in the wars for the Crown of France,\r\nas also for the souls of all the faithful departed.” Not unwisely\r\ntherefore has the piety of the present generation filled the niches\r\nof Chichele’s magnificent reredos with the statues of Clarence and\r\nYork, Salisbury and Talbot, Suffolk and Bedford, and others who struck\r\ntheir last stroke on the fatal plains of France. Nor can we doubt that\r\nthe Archbishop’s meaning was well expressed in the name that he gave\r\nto his foundation, which, copying the last words in the above-cited\r\nfoundation-charter, became known as the “Collegium Omnium Animarum\r\nFidelium Defunctorum in Oxonia.”\r\n\r\nTo found his College, Chichele purchased a large block of small\r\ntenements, among them several halls, forming the angle between Catte\r\nStreet and the High Street. The longer face was toward the former\r\nstreet, the frontage to “the High” being less than half that which\r\nlay along the narrower thoroughfare. The ground lay for the most\r\npart within the parish of St. Mary’s, with a small corner projecting\r\ninto that of St. Peter in the East. The buildings which Chichele\r\nproceeded to erect were very simple in plan. They consisted of a single\r\nquadrangle with a cloister behind it, and did not occupy more than half\r\nthe ground which had been purchased: the rest, where Hawkesmore’s twin\r\ntowers and Codrington’s library now stand, formed, in the founder’s\r\ntime, and for 250 years after, a small orchard and garden. Chichele’s\r\nmain building, the present “front quadrangle,” remains more entirely as\r\nthe founder left it than does any similar quadrangle in Oxford. Except\r\nthat some seventeenth century hand has cut square the cusped tops of\r\nits windows, it still bears its original aspect unchanged. The north\r\nside is formed by the chapel; the south contains the gate-tower with\r\nits muniment-room above, and had the Warden’s lodgings in its eastern\r\nangle; the west side was devoted entirely to the Fellows’ rooms, as\r\nwas also the whole of the east side, save the central part of its\r\nfirst floor, where the original library was situate. Into space which\r\nnow furnishes seventeen small sets of rooms, the forty Fellows of the\r\noriginal foundation were packed, together with their two chaplains,\r\ntheir porter, and their small establishment of servants.\r\n\r\nTo the north of this quadrangle lay the cloister, a small square,\r\ntwo of whose sides were formed by an arcade with open perpendicular\r\nwindows, much like New College cloister; the third by the chapel; while\r\nthe fourth was occupied by the College hall, an unpretentious building\r\nstanding exactly at right angles to the site of the modern hall. The\r\ncloister-quadrangle’s size may be judged from the fact that the chapel\r\nformed one entire side of it. It took up not more than a quarter of\r\nthe present back-quadrangle, and was surrounded to north and east\r\nby the garden and orchard of which we have already spoken. For many\r\ngenerations it formed the burial-ground of the Fellows, and on several\r\noccasions of late years, when trenches have been dug across the turf\r\nof the new quadrangle, the bones of fifteenth and sixteenth century\r\nmembers of the College have been found lying there undisturbed. To\r\nconclude the account of Chichele’s buildings, it must be added that on\r\nthe east side of the hall the kitchen and storehouses of the College\r\nmade a small irregular excrescence into the garden; their situation is\r\nnow occupied by that part of the present hall which lies nearest the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAll Chichele’s work was on a small scale save his chapel, on which he\r\nlavished special care. His reredos, preserved for two centuries behind\r\na coat of plaster, still remains to witness to his good taste; but its\r\noriginal aspect, blazing with scarlet, gold, and blue, must have been\r\nstrangely different from that which the nineteenth century knows. Of\r\nthe figures which adorned it a part only can be identified: at the\r\ntop was the Last Judgment, of which a considerable fragment was found\r\n_in situ_ when the plaster was cleared away, with its inscription,\r\n“Surgite mortui, venite ad judicium” still plainly legible. Immediately\r\nabove the altar was the Crucifixion; the cross and the wings of the\r\nsmall ministering angels of the modern reproduction being actually\r\nparts of the old sculpture. The carver, Richard Tillott, who executed\r\nthe work, mentions, in his account of expenses sent in for payment\r\nto Chichele, “two great stone images over the altar”; these may very\r\nprobably have been the founder and King Henry VI.; and the restorers of\r\nour own generation ventured to fill the two largest niches with their\r\nrepresentations. How the central and side portions of the reredos were\r\noccupied is unknown; but it would seem that the founder did not leave\r\nevery niche full, as fifty years after his death, Robert Este, a Fellow\r\nof the College, left £21 18_s._ 4_d._ for the completing of the images\r\nover the high altar.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the high altar, the chapel contained no less than seven\r\nside altars; where they were placed it is a little difficult to see,\r\nas the stalls bear every mark of being contemporary with the founder,\r\nand extend all along the sides of the chapel from the altar-steps to\r\nthe screen. Probably then the smaller altars--of which we know that\r\none was dedicated to the four Latin Fathers--must have been all, or\r\nnearly all, placed in the ante-chapel. The windows, both in the chapel\r\nand ante-chapel, were filled with excellent glass; all that of the\r\nchapel has disappeared, but in the ante-chapel there is much good\r\nwork remaining. The most interesting window contains an admirable set\r\nof historical figures; the founder, his masters Henry V. and Henry\r\nVI., John of Gaunt, and several more being in excellent preservation;\r\nbut this was not originally placed in the chapel, and seems to have\r\nbelonged to the old library. The other windows are filled with saints.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the foundation of the College to Chichele was about\r\n£10,000; that sum covered not only the erection and fitting up of the\r\nbuildings, but the purchase of some of the lands for its endowment. The\r\ntwo largest pieces of property which the Archbishop devoted to his new\r\ninstitution were situated respectively in Middlesex and Kent. The first\r\nestate lay around Edgeware, of which the College became lord of the\r\nmanor, and extended in the direction of Hendon and Willesden. It was\r\nmainly under wood in the founder’s day, and formed part of the tract of\r\nforest which covered so much of Middlesex down to the last century. The\r\nsecond property consisted of a large stretch of land in Romney Marsh,\r\nalready noted as a great grazing district in the fifteenth century.\r\nMany lesser estates lay scattered about the Midlands; they consisted in\r\nno small part of land belonging to the alien priories, which Chichele\r\nhad assisted Henry V. to abolish, and included at least one of the\r\nsuppressed houses--Black Abbey in Shropshire. For these confiscated\r\nestates the Archbishop paid £1000 to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe College as designed by Chichele contained forty Fellows; he\r\nnominated twenty himself, and these with their Warden, Richard Andrew,\r\nchose twenty more. By the Charter sixteen of the forty were to be\r\njurists--the founder remembered that he himself had taken his degree in\r\nLaws--and twenty-four artists. As Wykeham had done before him, Chichele\r\ntook pains to obtain a Bull from the Pope to sanction and confirm his\r\nnew foundation: in this document, dated from Florence in 1439, Eugenius\r\nIV. grants numerous spiritual privileges to the _pauperes scholares_\r\nof All Souls. They are excused certain fasts, freed from any parochial\r\ncontrol of the Vicar of St. Mary’s, permitted to bury their dead in the\r\nprecincts of the College, and even granted leave to celebrate the Mass\r\nin their chapel in time of interdict, “but with hushed bells and closed\r\ndoors.” Chichele was such a confirmed Papalist that he took the unusual\r\nstep of sending the first Warden to Italy in person, to receive the\r\nBull from the Pope’s own hands.\r\n\r\nNor was it only his spiritual superior that Chichele resolved to\r\ninterest in the College. When all was complete he went through the form\r\nof handing over the foundation to his young god-son Henry VI., and of\r\nreceiving it back from the King’s hands as co-founder. Hence comes the\r\nconstant juxtaposition of their names in the prayers of the College.\r\n\r\nChichele lived to see his College completely finished; in 1442 he\r\npresided at the solemn entry of the Fellows into their new abode, and\r\nformally delivered the statutes to Warden Andrew. Next year he died,\r\nat the end of his eightieth year, an age almost unparalleled among the\r\nshort-lived men of the fifteenth century. His successor, Archbishop\r\nStafford, on taking up the office of Visitor, was pleased to grant an\r\nindulgence of forty days to any Christian of the province of Canterbury\r\nwho should visit the chapel and there say a _Pater_ and an _Ave_ for\r\nthe souls of the faithful departed. This grant made the College a\r\nplace of not unfrequent resort for pilgrims. If a passage cited by\r\nProfessor Burrows[193] is correct, as many as 9000 wafers were consumed\r\nin the chapel on one day in 1557.\r\n\r\nFor the first century of the College’s existence the succession of\r\nWardens and Fellows was very rapid. Richard Andrew, the first head\r\nof the foundation, resigned his post in the same year that the new\r\nbuildings were opened, on receiving ecclesiastical preferment outside\r\nOxford. He became Dean of York, and survived his resignation for\r\nmany years. His successor, Warden Keyes, had been the architect of\r\nthe College; he presided for three years only, and then gave place\r\nto William Kele. Altogether in the first century of its existence\r\n1437-1537 the College knew no less than eleven Wardens, of whom seven\r\nresigned and only four died in harness. The Fellows were as rapid in\r\ntheir succession; not unfrequently seven or eight--a full fifth of the\r\nwhole number--vacated their Fellowships in a single year; the average\r\nannual election was about five. The shortness of their tenure of office\r\nis easily explained; a Fellowship was not a very valuable possession,\r\nfor beyond food and lodging it only supplied its holder with the\r\n“livery” decreed by the founder, an actual provision of cloth for his\r\nraiment. A Fellow’s commons were fixed on the modest scale of “one\r\nshilling a week when wheat is cheap, and sixteenpence when it is dear.”\r\nThe annual surplus from the estates was not divided up, but placed in\r\nthe College strong-box within the entrance-tower, against the day of\r\nneed. Moreover, as the Fellows were lodged two, or even in some cases\r\nthree, in each room, the accommodation can hardly have been such as to\r\ntempt to long residence. The acceptance of preferment outside Oxford,\r\nor even an absence of more than six months without the express leave\r\nof the College, sufficed to vacate the Fellowship; and since every\r\nmember of the foundation was in orders, it naturally resulted that\r\nthe “jurists” drifted up to London to practice, while the “artists”\r\naccepted country livings. Only those Fellows who were actually studying\r\nor teaching in the University held their places for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThere is little to tell about the first fifty years of the history\r\nof All Souls; but it is worthy of notice that its connection--merely\r\nnominal though it was--with its co-founder, Henry VI., brought on\r\ntrouble when the House of York came to the throne. Edward IV. pretended\r\nto regard the endowments of the College as wrongly-alienated royal\r\nproperty, and had to be appeased, not only by the insertion of his name\r\nand that of his mother Cecily in the prayers of the College, but by\r\npayment of a considerable fine. However, the College might congratulate\r\nitself on an easy escape, and its pardon was ratified when, some years\r\nlater, its head, Warden Poteman, was made envoy to Scotland, and\r\nafterwards promoted to be Archdeacon of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VII., when the Renaissance began to make itself\r\nfelt in Oxford, All Souls had the good fortune to produce two of the\r\nfirst English Greek scholars, Linacre and Latimer. The name of the\r\nlatter is forgotten--the present age remembers no Latimer save the\r\nmartyr-bishop; but Linacre’s memory is yet green. With Grocyn and\r\nColet he stands at the head of the roll of Oxford scholars, but in\r\nhis medical fame he is unrivalled. His contemporaries “questioned\r\nwhether he was a better Latinist or Grecian, a better grammarian or\r\nphysician”; but it is in the last capacity that he is now remembered.\r\nHe was elected to his Fellowship at All Souls in 1484, resided four\r\nor five years, and then went to Italy, where he tarried long, taught\r\nmedicine at Padua, and then returned to England to found and preside\r\nover the College of Physicians. The two Linacre professorships were\r\nboth endowed by him. The example of his career was not soon forgotten,\r\nand for two centuries All Souls continued to produce men of mark in the\r\nrealm of medicine. To this day it excites the surprise of the visitor\r\nto the College library to see the large proportion of books on medical\r\nsubjects contained in its shelves. Among the manuscripts there are many\r\nsuch, which Linacre’s own hands must have thumbed; while throughout the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries the purchases of medical books are\r\nonly exceeded by those of works on theology. But with the incoming of\r\nthe reign of the Founder’s-kin Fellows in the early eighteenth century\r\nthe physicians ceased out of the land, and at last, “holding a physic\r\nplace” became a convenient fiction by which lay members of the College\r\nsucceeded in excusing themselves from taking orders, though they might\r\nbe in reality anything rather than medical men.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry VII. saw the beginning of two sources of trouble\r\nto All Souls, which were not to cease for many generations. The first\r\nwas the interference of the Archbishop as Visitor, to determine the\r\nconditions of the tenure of Fellowships. William of Warham is found\r\nwriting to the College to denounce a growing practice of endeavouring\r\nto keep a Fellowship in conjunction with a benefice outside Oxford. He\r\nstrictly forbade it, and his commands seem to have been more effectual\r\nthan Visitor’s injunctions have usually proved. The other interference\r\nwith the College from without, was an attempt made by Arthur Prince\r\nof Wales to influence the annual elections of Fellows. He writes from\r\nSunninghill in 1500 to recommend the election of a young lawyer named\r\nPickering to a Fellowship, “because that his father is in the right\r\ntender favour of our dearest mother the Queen.” Pickering’s name does\r\nnot appear in the register of Fellows, so it is evident that the\r\nCollege found some excuse for evading compliance with the Prince’s\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nAll Souls seems to have passed through the storms of the Reformation\r\nwith singularly little friction from within or without. One single\r\nWarden, John Warner--the first Regius professor of Medicine in the\r\nUniversity--continued to steer the course of the College from 1536 to\r\n1556, complying with all the various commands of Henry VIII., making\r\nhimself acceptable both to Somerset and Northumberland, and even\r\nholding on for two years into Mary’s reactionary time. It is true that\r\nhe then resigned his post, but he was evidently no less complying\r\nunder the Papalist Queen than under her Protestant predecessor, as no\r\nharm came to him though he continued to reside in Oxford. Warden Pope,\r\nhis successor, having died in the first year of Elizabeth, Warner was\r\nimmediately restored to his old post, and held it till he was made Dean\r\nof Winchester in 1565.\r\n\r\nIt was during Warner’s wardenship that we have the first mention\r\nof an evil custom in the College, which was to form for a hundred\r\nyears a subject of dispute between the Fellows and their Visitor the\r\nArchbishop. This was the habit of “corrupt resignation.” A member of\r\nthe College, when about to vacate his Fellowship, not unfrequently had\r\nsome friend or relation whom he wished to succeed him. This candidate\r\nhe naturally pushed and supported at the annual election on All Souls’\r\nDay. It came to be the tacit custom of the College to elect candidates\r\nso supported; for each Fellow, when voting for an outgoing colleague’s\r\nnominee, remembered that he himself would some day wish to recommend a\r\n_protégé_ for election in a similar manner. This right of nomination\r\nbeing once grown customary, soon grew into a monstrous abuse, for\r\nunscrupulous Fellows, when about to vacate their places, began to hawk\r\ntheir nominations about Oxford. Actual payments in hard cash were made\r\nby equally unscrupulous Bachelors of Arts or Scholars of Civil Law, to\r\nsecure one of these all-powerful recommendations. Hence there began\r\nto appear in the College not the poor but promising scholars for whom\r\nChichele had designed the foundation, but men of some means, who had\r\npractically bought their places. Cranmer was the first Visitor who\r\ndiscovered and endeavoured to crush this noxious system. In 1541 we\r\nfind him declaring that he will impose an oath on every Fellow to obey\r\nhis injunction against the practice, and that every Fellowship obtained\r\nby a corrupt resignation shall be summarily forfeited. At the same time\r\nwe find him touching on other minor offences in the place--misdoings\r\nwhich seem ludicrously small compared to the huge abuse with which he\r\ncouples them. Fellows have been seen clad not in the plain livery which\r\nthe pious founder devised, but in gowns gathered round the collar and\r\narms and quilted with silk; they have been keeping dogs in College;\r\nsome of them have hired private servants; others of them have engaged\r\nin “compotationibus, ingurgitationibus, crapulis et ebrietatibus.” All\r\nthese customs are to cease at once. It is to be feared that the good\r\nArchbishop was as unsuccessful in suppressing these smaller sins and\r\nvanities, as he most certainly was in dealing with the evil of corrupt\r\nresignations.\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign of the same compliant Warden Warner, under whom\r\nCranmer’s visitation took place, that All Souls was robbed of its\r\ngreatest ornament--the decorations of its chapel. In 1549, by order\r\nof the Royal Commissioners appointed by Protector Somerset, havoc was\r\nmade with the whole interior of the building. The organ was removed,\r\nthe windows broken, the high-altar and seven side-altars taken down,\r\nand, worst of all, the whole reredos gutted; its fifty statues and\r\neighty-five statuettes were destroyed, and so it remained, vacant\r\nbut graceful, though much chipped about in the course of ages, till\r\nin the reign of Charles II. the Fellows in their wisdom concluded to\r\nplane down its projections, stuff its niches with plaster, and paint\r\na sprawling fresco upon it! The church vestments of the College were\r\nprobably destroyed at the same time that the chapel was made desolate,\r\nbut its church plate was not defaced, but merely removed to the\r\nmuniment-room and put in safe keeping. There it remained till 1554,\r\nwhen it came down again, and was again employed in Queen Mary’s time.\r\nIn 1560 it was once more put into store in the strong-room, and there\r\nit remained till in 1570 Archbishop Parker had it brought forth and\r\nbade it be melted down, “except six silver basons together with their\r\ncrewets, the gilt tabernacle, two silver bells, and a silver rod.”\r\nAfter a stout resistance lasting three years, the College was obliged\r\nto comply. Charles I. received nearly all that Parker spared, and of\r\nthe old communion-plate of All Souls there now survives nought but two\r\nof the crewets preserved in 1573. They are splendid pieces of the work\r\nof about 1500, eighteen inches high, shaped like pilgrim’s bottles, and\r\nornamented with swans’ heads. The founder’s silver-gilt and crystal\r\nsalt-cellar, the only other piece of antique silver which All Souls now\r\nowns, was most fortunately not in the hands of the College in Charles’s\r\ntime, or it would have shared the fate of the rest of its ancient plate.\r\n\r\nOne more incident of Warner’s tenure of office needs mention. He\r\nerected with subscriptions raised from all quarters as a residence for\r\nhimself, the building which faces the High Street in continuation of\r\nthe front quadrangle to the east. For the future, Wardens had six rooms\r\ninstead of two to live in, and there is splendour as well as comfort in\r\nthe magnificent panelled room on the first floor which forms the chief\r\napartment in the new building. Here dwelt Warner’s successors, till\r\nin the reign of Anne the present Warden’s lodgings were erected still\r\nfurther eastward.\r\n\r\nWarden Hoveden, whose long rule of forty-three years covered most of\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth and half that of James I. (1571-1614) was a man\r\nof mark. He adorned the old library, now the “great lecture-room,” in\r\nthe front quadrangle, with the beautiful barrel-roof and panelling\r\nwhich make it the best Elizabethan room in Oxford. He bought and added\r\nto the grounds of the College a large house and garden called “the\r\nRose,” where the Warden’s lodgings now stand. He arranged and codified\r\nthe College books and muniments. He caused to be constructed a splendid\r\nand elaborate set of maps of the College estates, ten years before any\r\nother College in the University thought of doing such a thing (1596).\r\nThese maps are worked out on a most minute scale: every tree and house\r\nis inserted; and as a proof of how English common-fields were still\r\nworked in minutely subdivided slips, only a few yards broad, they are\r\ninvaluable. One map gives a bird’s-eye view of All Souls, with its two\r\nquadrangles as then existing, and is the first good representation of\r\nthe College that remains. But Hoveden’s greatest achievements were his\r\ntwo victories in struggles with Queen Elizabeth. The first contest\r\nconcerned the parsonage and tithes of the parish of Stanton Harcourt;\r\nthe Crown and the College litigated about them for just forty years,\r\n1558-98; but Hoveden had his way, and in the latter year they came back\r\ninto the hands of the College. In the regrant of the disputed property,\r\nthe Queen’s reasons are stated to be the poverty of the College and\r\nthe want of a convenient house near Oxford to which the Fellows might\r\nretire in times of pestilence in the University. Epidemical disorders\r\nhad been very common at the date: in 1570-1 the plague carried off 600\r\npersons, and in 1577 a fearful distemper in consequence of the “Black\r\nAssize” was no less fatal. Such a house as Stanton Harcourt parsonage\r\nwas then of infinite utility, and for more than 200 years the College\r\nused to compel its tenants by a covenant in their lease, to “find\r\nfour chambers in the house, furnished with bedding linen, and woollen\r\nfor so many of the fellows as shall be sent to lodge there whenever\r\nany pestilence or other contagious disorder shall happen in the\r\nUniversity.” The second struggle resulted from an attempt of Elizabeth\r\nto induce All Souls to grant a lease of all their woods to Lady\r\nStafford, at the ridiculously small rent of twenty pounds per annum.\r\nHoveden resisted stoutly, and his refusal drew down a most disgraceful\r\nletter of threats from Sir Walter Raleigh. Sir Walter intimates that\r\nthe Queen is highly incensed that “subjects of your quality” should\r\npresume to chaffer with her, and hints at evils to come if compliance\r\nis still refused. The Warden replied that the terms offered were so\r\nbad that if they were taken the Fellows would be compelled to give\r\nup housekeeping and take to the fields. To this it was answered that\r\n“their state was so plentiful by her Majesty’s statute, that they\r\nseemed rather as fat monks in a rich abbey than students in a poor\r\nCollege.” Hoveden stood his ground and enlisted Whitgift, the Visitor,\r\nto work with Lord Burleigh in the defence of the College. Burleigh\r\nmoved Elizabeth to relax her pressure, and Lady Stafford never obtained\r\nher cheap lease.\r\n\r\nBy the end of Hoveden’s time a new subject of interest comes to the\r\nfront in the management of the College. The rise in wealth and in\r\nprices which characterized the Tudor epoch resulted in the development\r\nof the annual surplus from the College estates into unexpected\r\nproportions. When all outgoings were paid there were often £500 or\r\n£600 left to be transferred to the strong-box in the gate-tower.\r\nIt naturally occurred to the Fellows that some of this money might\r\nreasonably come their way. Archbishop Whitgift allowed them to augment\r\ntheir daily commons from it, and afterwards bade them commute their\r\n“livery” in cloth for a reasonable equivalent in cash. This was done,\r\nbut still the annual surplus cash grew. Archbishop Bancroft directed\r\nit “to amendment of diet and other necessary uses of common charge.”\r\nHe soon found that this merely led to luxurious living. “It is\r\nastonishing,” he wrote, “this kind of beer which heretofore you have\r\nhad in your College, and I do strictly charge you, that from henceforth\r\nthere be no other received into your buttery but small-and middle-beer,\r\nbeer of higher rates being fitter for tippling-houses.” Yet the College\r\nstrong ale still survives! Nor was it only in its drinking that the\r\nCollege offended: its eating corresponded: the gaudés, and the annual\r\nBursar’s dinner became huge banquets, costing some £40; guests were\r\ninvited in scores, and the festivities prolonged to the third day.\r\nSuch things were only natural when the Fellows had the disposal of a\r\nlarge revenue, yet were not allowed to draw from it more than food and\r\nclothing. At last, Archbishop Abbott, in 1620 bethought him of a less\r\ndemoralizing way of disposing of the surplus: he boldly doubled the\r\nlivery-money. Then for the first time a Fellowship became worth some\r\ndefinite value in hard cash. The next step was easy enough; instead of\r\na fixed double livery, there was distributed annually so many times\r\nthe original livery as the surplus could safely furnish. The seniors\r\ndrew more than the juniors, and the jurists more then the artists. This\r\narrangement, after working in practice for many years, was sanctioned\r\nin theory also by Archbishop Sheldon in 1666.\r\n\r\nIt is in a letter of Archbishop Abbott’s, dealing with one of the\r\nriotous feasts to which the College had grown addicted, that we have\r\nour first mention of that celebrated bird, the All Souls Mallard. The\r\nVisitor writes--“The feast of Christmas drawing now to an end, doth put\r\nme in mind of the great outrage which, as I am informed, was the last\r\nyear committed in your College, where although matters had formerly\r\nbeen conducted with some distemper, yet men did never before break\r\nforth into such intolerable liberty as to tear down doors and gates,\r\nand disquiet their neighbours as if it had been a camp or a town in\r\nwar. Civil men should never so far forget themselves under pretence of\r\na foolish mallard, as to do things barbarously unbecoming.” Evidently\r\nthe gaudé had developed into one of those outbreaks, which a modern\r\nOxford College knows well enough when its boat has gone head of the\r\nriver. Furniture had been smashed, perhaps a bonfire lighted; certainly\r\nthe noise had been long and loud. But what of the Mallard? Pamphlets\r\nhave been written on him, and College tradition tells that when the\r\nfirst stone of the College was laid a mallard was started out of a\r\ndrain on the spot. In commemoration of the event, the Fellows annually\r\nwent round the College after the gaudé, pretending to search for the\r\ntutelary bird. The song concerning him was written to be sung by “Lord\r\nMallard,” a Fellow chosen as the official songster of the College. It\r\nbears every appearance of being of Jacobean date--\r\n\r\n    “Griffin, Turkey, Bustard, Capon,\r\n    Let other hungry mortals gape on,\r\n    And on their bones with stomachs fall hard,\r\n    But let All Souls’ men have their Mallard.\r\n\r\n    _Chorus_--\r\n    O by the blood of King Edward,\r\n    It was a swapping, swapping Mallard!\r\n\r\n    “The Romans once admired a gander\r\n    More than they did their chief Commander,\r\n    Because he saved, if some don’t fool us,\r\n    The place that’s named from the scull of Tolus.[194]\r\n\r\n    _Chorus, etc._\r\n\r\n    “The poets feign Jove turned a swan,\r\n    But let them prove it if they can,\r\n    As for our proof it’s not at all hard--\r\n    He was a swapping, swapping Mallard.\r\n\r\n    _Chorus, etc._\r\n\r\n    “Then let us drink and dance a Galliard\r\n    Unto the memory of the Mallard,\r\n    And as the Mallard dives in pool,\r\n    Let’s dabble, duck, and dive in bowl.”\r\n\r\n    _Chorus, etc._\r\n\r\nSo for three hundred years, if not for four, has Lord Mallard annually\r\nchanted. But the last time that we have proof of a procession having\r\ngone round the College with torches, pursuing the mock search for the\r\nbird, is in 1801, when Bishop Heber, then a scholar of Brazenose,\r\nmentions in a letter home that he had witnessed the scene from his\r\nwindows across the Radcliffe Square.\r\n\r\nProfessor Burrows in a most ingenious passage of his _Worthies_ makes\r\na plausible suggestion as to the real origin of the Mallard. He found\r\nin Alderman Fletcher’s copy of Anthony à Wood, now in the Bodleian, the\r\nimpression of a seal bearing a griffin, inscribed “_Sigillum Guilielmi\r\nMallardi Clerici_.” This seal of one Mallard was actually dug up in\r\nmaking a drain on the site of All Souls, to the east of the Warden’s\r\nlodgings. Can the exhuming of Mallard’s seal have been turned by oral\r\ntradition into the finding of an actual mallard?\r\n\r\nDown to the time of the great Civil War the College, though always\r\nmore or less tainted with the evil of corrupt resignations, continued\r\nto produce a great number of able men. Since the Reformation laymen\r\nare found among them as well as clerics. We may name Lord Chancellor\r\nWeston, Mason and Petre, both Privy Councillors of note, and the\r\nPersian traveller Sir Anthony Sherley, under Elizabeth; while in the\r\nearly seventeenth century we meet Archbishop Sheldon--long Warden of\r\nthe College--Bishop Duppa, and Jeremy Taylor. The election of the\r\nlast-named illustrates in the most striking way the manner in which\r\ncorrupt resignations had come to be looked upon as matters of routine.\r\nOsborne, a Fellow about to vacate his place, instead of putting his\r\nnomination up for sale, made a present of it to Archbishop Laud. Laud,\r\ntaking the procedure as the most natural thing in the world, bade him\r\nnominate Taylor, who was therefore elected, but with great murmurs from\r\nthe College, for he was a Cambridge man, and of nine years standing\r\nsince his degree.\r\n\r\nThose who know only the modern constitution of All Souls, will find it\r\nstartling to learn that down to the Great Rebellion the College was not\r\nwithout its fair share of undergraduates. There was no provision for\r\nthem in the statutes, but a number of “poor scholars” (_servientes_)\r\nwere allowed to matriculate. In 1612 there were as many as thirty-one\r\nof them on the books at once. In going through a list of All Souls men\r\nwho became Fellows of Wadham between 1615 and 1660, I found that about\r\none in three were _servientes_, so their number must have been not\r\ninconsiderable. The College narrowly escaped having a regular provision\r\nof scholars, for Archbishop Parker had planned the endowment of a\r\nconsiderable number of scholarships from Canterbury Grammar School when\r\nhe died. After the Restoration the _servientes_ are no more heard of,\r\nor at least the four Bible-clerks then appear as their sole successors.\r\n\r\nFew Colleges suffered more from the Civil Wars than All Souls. Its\r\nhead, Sheldon, was one of the King’s chaplains, and all, save a very\r\nsmall minority of the Fellows, were enthusiastic Royalists. One of\r\nthem, William St. John, was slain in battle in the King’s cause, and\r\nothers of them bore arms for him. It is most pitiful to read the\r\naccount of the College plate which went to the melting-pot in New Inn\r\nHall, to come forth as the ugly Oxford shillings of Charles I. All\r\nSouls contributed 253 lbs. 1 oz. 19 dwts. in all, more than any other\r\nhouse save Magdalen, besides a large sum in ready money. Its treasury\r\nwas swept clean of the founder’s gifts, of Warden Keyes’ “great cupp\r\ndouble gilt with the image of St. Michael on its cover,” of all the\r\nchurch-plate that had escaped Parker, of tankards, flagons, and goblets\r\ninnumerable. Worse was to follow: the bulk of the College estates lay\r\nin Kent and Middlesex, counties in the hands of the Parliament, and\r\ntheir rents could not be raised. At the end of the first year the\r\ntenants were £600 in arrears, and the evil went on growing, while at\r\nthe same time the demands on the purse of the College were increasing.\r\nIn June 1643 the College was directed by the King to maintain 102\r\nsoldiers for a month, at the rate of four shillings a week per man.\r\nIt had to contribute towards the fortifications, towards stores for\r\nthe siege, and towards the relief of the poor of the city. Altogether\r\nit would seem that the finances of the College went to pieces, and\r\nthat the greater part of the Fellows dispersed. When the Parliamentary\r\nVisitors got to work on the University, as much as two years after\r\nthe fall of Oxford, they found only eleven members of the College in\r\nresidence. Warden Sheldon was summoned before them to ask whether he\r\nacknowledged their authority, and replied with frankness, “I cannot\r\nsatisfy myself that I ought to submit to this visitation.” Next day\r\na notice of ejectment was served upon him, and the day following the\r\nChancellor Pembroke went with the Visitors to expel him. They found\r\nSheldon walking in his little garden, read their decree to him, and\r\nthen sent for the College buttery-book, out of which they struck\r\nhis name, inserting instead of it that of Dr. Palmer, whom they had\r\ndesignated as his successor. Next they bade him give over his keys, and\r\nwhen he refused broke open his lodgings, installed Palmer in them, and\r\nsent the rightful owner away under a guard of musketeers, “followed as\r\nhe went by a great company of scholars, and blessed by the people as he\r\npassed down the street.”\r\n\r\nOf the Fellows, only five made their peace with the Visitors, and\r\navoided expulsion; even five of the College servants were deprived of\r\ntheir places. The Commissioners proceeded for five years to nominate\r\nto the Fellowships, and intruded in all forty-three new members on\r\nto the foundation between 1648 and 1653. It is only fair to say that\r\nif some of them were abnormal personages--such as Jerome Sanchy, who\r\ncombined the functions of Proctor and Colonel of Horse--others were men\r\nof conspicuous merit. The most noteworthy of them was Sydenham, the\r\ngreatest medical name except Linacre that the College--perhaps that\r\nEngland--can boast.\r\n\r\nIn 1653, free elections recommenced, and as the first-fruits of their\r\nlabours the new Fellows co-opted Christopher Wren. This greatest of all\r\nthe Fellows of All Souls was in residence for eight years, working from\r\nthe very first year of his election at architecture, though astronomy\r\nand mathematics were also taking up part of his time. Ere he had been\r\nmany months a Fellow, he erected the large sundial, with the motto\r\n_pereunt et imputantur_, which now adorns the Library. In 1661 he\r\nresigned his Fellowship on becoming Professor of Astronomy, and shortly\r\nafter departed for London. Almost the only note of his All Souls\r\nlife that survives is the fact that he was a great frequenter of the\r\nnewly-established coffee-house, next door to University College. His\r\nfamous architectural drawings were left to the College, and are still\r\npreserved in the Library.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the Restoration passed over with very little friction\r\nat All Souls. Palmer, the intruding Warden, died in the very month of\r\nKing Charles’ return, and Sheldon peaceably took possession of his old\r\nplace. But within two years he was called off, to become Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, and John Meredith reigned in his stead. This Warden’s\r\nshort tenure of office is marked by the horrible mutilation of the\r\nreredos to which we have already alluded. The College must needs\r\nhave a “restoration” of its chapel, and in the true spirit of the\r\n“restorer,” broke away much of what was characteristic in it, plastered\r\nup the rest, and hired Streater, painter to the king, to daub a “Last\r\nJudgment” on the flat space thus obtained. Having accomplished this\r\nfeat Meredith died.\r\n\r\nMeredith’s successor, Jeames, prompted and supported by Archbishop\r\nSancroft, succeeded in finally putting down the evil of corrupt\r\nresignations, which had survived the Parliamentary Visitation, and\r\nblossomed out into all its old luxuriance in the easy times of the\r\nRestoration. The fight came to a head in 1680-1, when Jeames, for two\r\nyears running, used his veto to prevent the election of all candidates\r\nnominated by resigners. The veto frustrating any election, the Visitor\r\nwas by the statutes allowed to fill up the vacant places, and did so.\r\nThe threat that the same procedure should again be carried out in the\r\nnext year brought the majority of the College to reason, though for the\r\nwhole twelve months, Nov. 1680-Nov. 1681, twenty-four discontented\r\nFellows, whom Jeames called “the Faction,” were moving heaven and earth\r\nto get the Warden’s right of veto rescinded. From 1682 onwards, the\r\ntype of Fellow improved, and some of the most distinguished members\r\nof the College date from the years 1680-1700. It is in this period,\r\nhowever, that the complaint begins to be heard that All Souls looked\r\nto birth quite as much as to learning in choosing its candidates.\r\n“They generally,” says Hearne--a great enemy of the College--“pick out\r\nthose that have no need of a Fellowship, persons of great fortunes and\r\ngood birth, and often of no morals and less learning.” For the former\r\npart of this statement, the names in the College register give some\r\njustification: concerning the latter, we can only say that the average\r\nof men who came to great things in the list of Fellows is higher in\r\nHearne’s time than at any other. To this period belong Dr. Clarke,\r\nSecretary of War under William III., Christopher Codrington--of whom\r\nmore hereafter--Bishop Tanner the antiquary, Sir Nathaniel Lloyd, and\r\nmany more.\r\n\r\nThe reign of James II. was fraught with as much danger to All Souls as\r\nto the other Colleges of the University. Warden Jeames died in 1686,\r\nand every one expected and dreaded an attempt to force a Papist head\r\non the College. What happened was almost as bad. There was in the\r\nfoundation a very junior Fellow--only elected in 1682--named Leopold\r\nFinch, son of the Earl of Winchelsea, whose riotous outbreaks and\r\nhabitual fits of inebriety had done much to embitter Jeames’ last years\r\nof rule. Finch was a hot Tory, and when, on the outbreak of Monmouth’s\r\nrebellion, the University proposed to raise a regiment of trained-bands\r\nfor the King, was one of the leaders in the movement. He enlisted a\r\ncompany of musketeers from members of All Souls and Merton, and this\r\ncompany was the only part of the University battalion that actually\r\ntook the field. Its not very glorious record of service consisted in\r\noccupying Islip for ten days, to secure the London road, and stop all\r\ntransit of suspicious persons. When the news of Sedgmoor came, Lord\r\nAbingdon bade the company dine with him at Rycot, and they came home\r\n“well fuzzed with his ale,” insomuch that their very drum was stove in,\r\nand remains so to this day, stored, with one of the muskets borne by\r\nthe volunteers, in All Souls Bursary.\r\n\r\nFinch had nothing to recommend him save this military exploit, his\r\ngood birth, and his notorious looseness of life and conscience.\r\nHe was thought by the King capable of anything in the way of\r\nsubmission--perhaps even of conversion to Papacy--and on the death\r\nof Jeames the College, to its horror, learned that Finch had been\r\nnominated as Warden. Less courageous than the Fellows of Magdalen,\r\nthe All Souls men, though they refused to elect Finch in due form,\r\nrefrained from choosing any other head, and allowed the intruder to\r\ntake possession of the Warden’s house and prerogatives. Finch, though\r\na man of some learning, made as disreputable a head of the College as\r\nmight have been expected: he jobbed, he drank, he ran into debt, and\r\nfinally he was found to have embezzled College money. But when William\r\nof Orange landed, his Toryism disappeared, and he saved his place by\r\nsuddenly becoming a hot Whig. All the punishment that he ever got\r\nfor his usurpation, was that he was compelled to acknowledge himself\r\nas only “pseudo-custos,” and to submit to be re-appointed to his\r\nWardenship in a more legal way. He presided for sixteen years over the\r\nCollege with much disrepute, and died in 1702--with the bailiffs in his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nFinch was succeeded by Bernard Gardiner, a very different character.\r\nGardiner was a good scholar and a good man, but decidedly testy and\r\ncholeric; in politics he was that somewhat abnormal creature, a\r\nHanoverian Tory, and succeeded in earning the dislike of both parties.\r\nHe was the Vice-Chancellor who deprived Hearne of his place in the\r\nBodleian for Jacobitism, yet he also fought a furious battle with\r\nWake, the Whig Archbishop, who was his Visitor. With a large faction\r\nof the Fellows he had equally numerous passages of arms, yet still the\r\nCollege flourished under him. It was in his time that the great back\r\nquadrangle, the new Hall, and the new Warden’s lodgings, were built.\r\n\r\nThese spacious buildings were erected not with College money, but by\r\ngenerous and long-continued benefactions from the Fellows. Dr. Clarke,\r\nthe Secretary of War, was the chief donor: “God send us many such\r\nample benefactors” wrote his grateful Warden in the College book. He\r\nbuilt the Warden’s lodgings out of his own pocket, besides paying for\r\nthe “restoration” of the east end of the chapel. This consisted in\r\npainting over Streater’s bad fresco[195] a much better production by\r\nSir James Thornhill--the somewhat heathenish but spirited Apotheosis\r\nof Chichele--which was taken down in our own generation. Below the\r\nfresco were placed two marble pillars, supporting an entablature, which\r\nframed Raphael Mengs’ pleasing “_Noli me tangere_,” the picture which\r\nnow adorns the ante-chapel. After Clarke the most generous donors were\r\nSir Nathaniel Lloyd, who gave £1350 in all; Mr. Greville, who built the\r\nnew cloister; and General Stuart. Hawkesmoor, Wren’s favourite pupil,\r\nwas their architect; it is to him that we owe the strange but not\r\nineffective twin-towers, the classic cloister, the vaulted buttery, and\r\nthe lofty hall with its bare mullionless windows.\r\n\r\nBut there was one Fellow in the reign of Anne who was even a greater\r\nbenefactor than Clarke and Lloyd. It was to Christopher Codrington\r\nthat the College owes the magnificent library, which so far surpasses\r\nall its rivals in the University, save the Bodleian alone. Codrington\r\nwas a kind of Admirable Creighton, poet and soldier, bibliophile and\r\nstatesman. In the same year he gained military promotion for his\r\ngallantry at the siege of Namur, welcomed William III. to Oxford in\r\na speech whose elegant Latinity softened even Jacobite critics, and\r\nundertook the government of the English West India Islands. He died at\r\nBarbadoes in 1710, and left to his well-loved College 12,000 books,\r\nvalued at £6000, with a legacy of £10,000 to build a fit edifice to\r\nhold them, and a fund to maintain it. The Codrington Library, commenced\r\nin 1716, took many years to build, but at last stood completed, a\r\nfar more successful work than the hall which faces it across the\r\nquadrangle. It is 200 feet long, and holds with ease the 70,000 books\r\nto which the College library has now swollen. A public reading-room was\r\nadded to it in 1867, and it is for students of law and history as much\r\nof an institution as the Bodleian itself.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century gave All Souls many brilliant Fellows, but it\r\ndestroyed the original purpose of the foundation, and ended by making\r\nit an abuse and a byword. It is only necessary to mention the names of\r\na few of its members, to show how large a share of the great men of the\r\ntime passed through the College. It claims the great Blackstone--for\r\nmany years an indefatigable bursar--the second name to Wren among the\r\nlist of Fellows. Two Lord Chancellors came from it, Lord Talbot of\r\nHensoll, and Lord Northington; Young the poet was a resident for many\r\nyears; one Archbishop, Vernon Harcourt of York, and eight Bishops\r\nhad been Fellows. With them, though elected in the opening years of\r\nthe present century, must be mentioned Reginald Heber, the first and\r\ngreatest of our missionary prelates.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these great names, the College--like the whole\r\nUniversity--was in a bad way. Two abuses destroyed its usefulness. The\r\nfirst was the introduction of non-residence. Down to the reign of Anne,\r\na Fellow who left Oxford without the _animus revertendi_, forfeited\r\nhis Fellowship. Every one quitting the College, even for a few months,\r\nhad to obtain a temporary leave of absence, and to state his intention\r\nto return. Gradually Fellows began to devise ingenious excuses for\r\nprolonged non-residence; the favourite ones were that they were about\r\nto study physic, and must therefore travel; or that they were in the\r\nservice of the Crown, and must be excused on public grounds. The test\r\ncase on which the battle was finally fought out was that of Blencowe,\r\na Fellow who had become “Decypherer to the Queen” (interpreter of the\r\ncyphers so much used in despatches at that time). Warden Gardiner\r\nstrove to make him resign, but Blencowe moved Sunderland, the Secretary\r\nof State, to interfere in his behalf with the Visitor, and it was\r\nformally ruled that his service with the Crown excused him from\r\nresidence, as well as from his obligation under the statutes to take\r\norders. For the future the Fellows all found some excuse--taking out a\r\ncommission in the militia was the favourite one--for saying that they\r\nwere in the royal service, and thereby excused from residence. From\r\nabout 1720 the number of residents goes down gradually from twenty or\r\nthirty to six or seven. The remainder of the Fellows, like Gibbon’s\r\nenemies at Magdalen, remembered to draw their emoluments, but forgot\r\ntheir statutory obligations.\r\n\r\nAlmost as injurious as the exemption from residence was the\r\nintroduction of a new theory that Founder’s-kin candidates had an\r\nabsolute preference over all others. Archbishop Wake is responsible for\r\nits recognition: a certain Robert Wood, in 1718, claimed to be elected\r\nsimply on account of his birth, and the Visitor ruled that he must be\r\nadmitted, in spite of the custom of the College, which had never before\r\ntaken account of such a right. At first the Founder’s-kin appeared in\r\nsmall numbers--there are only twelve between 1700 and 1750--but about\r\nthe middle of the century they appear to have suddenly woken up to the\r\nadvantages of obtaining a Fellowship without condition or examination.\r\nBetween 1757 and 1777 thirty-nine Fellows out of fifty-eight elected\r\nare set down as _cons. fund._ in the College books. Archbishop\r\nCornwallis in 1777 ruled that it was not obligatory upon the College\r\nthat more than ten of the Fellows should be of Founder’s kin, and from\r\nthis time forth the claim of Founder’s kin had no direct influence\r\nupon the elections. But the doctrine had done its work. It brought the\r\nFellowships within a charmed circle of county families, outside of\r\nwhich the College rarely looked when the morrow of All Souls Day came\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this was to create a society of an abnormal sort in the\r\nmidst of a group of Colleges which, whatever their shortcomings may\r\nhave been, continued to make a profession of study and teaching. The\r\nFellows were men of good birth, and usually of good private means.\r\nHence came the well-known joke that they were required to be “bene\r\nnati, bene vestiti, et moderate docti,” a saying formed, as Professor\r\nBurrows has pointed out, by ingeniously twisting the three clauses\r\nin the statutes which bade them be “de legitimo matrimonio nati,”\r\n“vestiti sicut eorum honestati convenit clericali,” and “in plano cantu\r\ncompetenter docti.”\r\n\r\nThe Fellows had no educational duties or emoluments, and consequently\r\nno inducement to reside except for purposes of study: and for the\r\nmost part they were not studious, nor resident. The Fellowships\r\nwere poor, and so were only attractive to men of means. Hence the\r\nmanagement of the College property was a matter of indifference, and\r\nit was neglected. Other Colleges no doubt neglected their duties and\r\nmismanaged their properties, but All Souls men took a pride in having\r\nno duties and in being indifferent to the income arising from their\r\nestates. Gradually the College drew more and more apart from its\r\nneighbours, until the Fellows made it a point to know nothing and to\r\ncare nothing about the teaching, the study, or the business that was\r\ngoing on just outside their walls.\r\n\r\nYet a period during which Blackstone, Heber, and the present Prime\r\nMinister were numbered among the Fellows, cannot be said to be\r\nundistinguished in the history of the College; and this system,\r\nindefensible in itself, has handed down some things which the present\r\ngeneration would not be willing to lose. This College, which had become\r\nsomewhat of a family party, was animated by a peculiarly strong feeling\r\nof corporate loyalty. And throughout the change and stir of the last\r\nforty years, and in the new and many-sided development of the College,\r\nthe close tie which binds the Fellow, wherever he may be, to the\r\nCollege has never been weakened. And as the College has come back to an\r\nintimate connection with the life of the University, its non-resident\r\nelement is not without value. The lawyer, the member of Parliament,\r\nthe diplomatist, and the civil servant, no longer disregarding the\r\nUniversity and its pursuits, are an element of great value in a society\r\nwhich is too apt to be engrossed in the details of teaching and of\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nThe University Commission of 1854 swept away the rights of Founder’s\r\nkin together with many other provisions of the Statutes of Chichele,\r\nappropriated ten Fellowships to the endowment of Chairs of Modern\r\nHistory and International Law, and threw open the rest to competition\r\nin the subjects of Law and Modern History. The Commission of 1877\r\nthreatened graver changes, and for a while it was doubtful whether\r\nAll Souls might not become an undergraduate College of the ordinary\r\ntype. But in the end the College was allowed to retain, by means of\r\nnon-resident Fellowships, its old connection with the world outside,\r\nwhile in other ways its endowments were utilized for study and\r\nteaching. On the whole it cannot be said to have suffered more than\r\nothers from the want of constructive genius in the Commissioners.\r\nIt is and will be a College of many Fellows and several Professors,\r\nwith liabilities to contribute annual sums to Bodley’s Library and to\r\nundergraduate education. The Fellowships are terminable in seven years,\r\nbut may be renewed in limited numbers and on a reduced emolument.\r\n\r\nUnder these new conditions All Souls--though still somewhat scantily\r\ninhabited--is no longer given over during a great part of each year\r\nto the bats and owls. It now plays a useful and important part in the\r\nUniversity. Its Hall and lecture-rooms are crowded with undergraduates,\r\nits reading-room is full of students of law and history, and its Warden\r\nand Fellows have produced in the last ten years about twice as many\r\nbooks as any two other Colleges in the University put together. Last,\r\nbut not least, it has continued most loyally to fulfil its obligation\r\nof providing prize Fellowships; no other foundation can say, though\r\nseveral are far richer than All Souls, that it has regularly offered\r\nFellowships for competition for twenty consecutive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nMAGDALEN COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. H. A. WILSON, M.A., FELLOW OF MAGDALEN COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cloisters of Magdalen College, over one of the arches of the\r\n“Founder’s Tower,” there is to be seen a heraldic rose surmounting\r\nthe armorial bearings common to the kings of the rival Houses of York\r\nand Lancaster. The rose itself, apparently once red and afterwards\r\npainted white, is a curiously significant memorial of the civil strife\r\nwhich affected the early fortunes of the College, and of animosities\r\nwhich were perhaps still too keen, when Waynflete’s tower was built,\r\nto allow the Red Rose to appear even as a witness to the fact that his\r\nfoundation had its beginning under a Lancastrian king.\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign and under the patronage of Henry VI. that the\r\nfounder himself rose to his greatness. Of his early life little is\r\nknown with any certainty. His father, Richard Patten or Barbour, was\r\napparently a man of good descent and position.[196] His mother Margery\r\nwas a daughter of Sir William Brereton, a Cheshire gentleman who had\r\nreceived knighthood for his military services in France. His change of\r\nsurname was probably made at the time of his ordination as sub-deacon\r\nin 1421. That which he adopted was derived from his birthplace, a town\r\non the coast of Lincolnshire. He is sometimes said to have received his\r\neducation at one or both of the “two St. Mary Winton Colleges,” but\r\nof this there is no evidence, and we know nothing of his University\r\ncareer except the fact that he proceeded to the degree of Master of\r\nArts. He must have been still a young man when he was appointed in 1428\r\nto the mastership of the school at Winchester, where he also received,\r\nfrom Cardinal Beaufort, the mastership of a Hospital dedicated to St.\r\nMary Magdalen. To his connection with this foundation we may perhaps\r\ntrace his especial devotion to its patron Saint, and the consequent\r\ndedication of St. Mary Magdalen College. In 1440, Henry VI. visited\r\nWinchester to gather hints for his scheme for Eton College, and invited\r\nWaynflete to become the first master of the school which formed part\r\nof his new foundation. He also made him one of the original body of\r\nFellows of Eton, and a few years later promoted him to be Provost. It\r\nwas most probably at this time, and to commemorate his connection with\r\nEton, that Waynflete augmented his family arms by the addition of the\r\nthree lilies which appear, with a difference of arrangement, on the\r\narms of Eton College, and on those which Magdalen College derives from\r\nits founder.\r\n\r\nIn 1447, the See of Winchester became vacant by the death of Cardinal\r\nBeaufort, and the King at once recommended William Waynflete for\r\nelection. He was elected within a few days, and was consecrated at Eton\r\non the 13th July of the same year. Immediately after his elevation\r\nto the Episcopate, he seems to have set himself to promote the\r\ninterests of learning, and to provide for a need which his experience\r\nas a schoolmaster had impressed upon his mind, by a foundation in\r\nthe University of Oxford. Early in 1448, before his enthronement\r\nat Winchester, he obtained from the King a license to found a Hall\r\nfor a President and fifty scholars, to be called St. Mary Magdalen\r\nHall.[197] At the same time he obtained, for a term of years, a\r\nsite and buildings which occupied the ground now covered by the new\r\nExamination Schools, and in two or more of the halls included in this\r\nproperty he placed his new society, of which he chose John Hornley\r\nto be the first President. In 1456 Waynflete became Chancellor, and\r\non his elevation to that position he at once conceived the idea of\r\nimproving his foundation at Oxford, by converting it from a Hall into\r\na College, and by providing it with a better habitation and more ample\r\nendowments. For this purpose, having obtained the necessary permission\r\nfrom the King, he acquired for the Hall the buildings, site, and\r\nproperty belonging to the ancient Hospital of St. John Baptist. The\r\nproperty of the Hospital included the tenements which the members of\r\nthe Hall had until this time inhabited. The Hospital itself was a\r\nnon-academical institution, having for its purpose the care of pilgrims\r\nand the relief of the poor.[198] It had been in existence before the\r\nreign of John, from whom, while he was still known as Count of Mortain,\r\nits Master and Brethren had received benefactions; and it had been\r\nendowed, and perhaps refounded, by Henry III. The existing Master and\r\nBrethren retired upon pensions, the poor inmates of the Hospital were\r\nduly provided for, and the Hospital was united to the College, which\r\nWaynflete founded by a charter of June 12th, 1458. The members of\r\nthe Hall, with the exception of Hornley, who retired to make way for\r\nWilliam Tybarde, the first President of the College, were transferred\r\nto the new foundation, and the Hall ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe members of the College appear to have continued to occupy the\r\nbuildings formerly leased to the Hall, which had now become their\r\nown property, until the Founder should carry out his intention of\r\nproviding new buildings on the site of the Hospital, and the land\r\nadjoining it. The fulfilment of this intention was long deferred,\r\nas were some of the plans upon which Waynflete now entered for\r\nthe increased endowment of his foundation. The troubles in which\r\nthe country was now for some years involved, and the change in\r\nWaynflete’s own position, probably account for the delay. In 1460,\r\na few days before the battle of Northampton, Waynflete resigned the\r\nChancellorship, an act which seems to have brought him into discredit\r\nwith the Lancastrian party, though not with Henry himself. He does\r\nnot seem to have taken any active part in the events which followed,\r\non either side; but his sympathies appear to have been with the House\r\nof Lancaster. We are told by one authority that he “was in great\r\ndedignation with King Edward, and fled for fere of him into secrete\r\ncorners, but at last was restored to his goodes and the kinges favour.”\r\nIn 1469, when Edward’s power was fully established, a full pardon\r\nfor all offences, probable and improbable, was granted to Waynflete:\r\nbut some years earlier Edward had confirmed to him the charters\r\nand privileges of his See, from which we may reasonably infer that\r\nhis period of hiding had not been very long. It was not, however,\r\ntill after the death of Henry VI. that the College began to resume\r\nits prosperity, and the work of building was actually begun. The\r\nfoundation-stone of the chapel was laid in 1474; and in 1480, before\r\nthe building was actually finished, the President and scholars removed\r\nfrom their temporary quarters, and occupied the College, using the\r\noratory of the Hospital for their place of worship until the chapel was\r\ncompleted. The Vicar of St. Peter’s in the East, in which parish the\r\nCollege was situated, gave up all claims to tithes and dues within its\r\nprecincts in consideration of a fixed annual payment, and the College\r\nwas transferred by the Bishop of Lincoln, with consent of the Dean and\r\nChapter, to the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Winchester, who were to\r\nbe also its Visitors.\r\n\r\nThe society had until this time possessed no body of statutes. Such\r\na code was now given by the founder, and a new President was also\r\nappointed by him as successor to Tybarde, who was old and in failing\r\nhealth. The person chosen for this office was Richard Mayew, of\r\nNew College, who took possession on August 23rd, 1480, and at once\r\nproceeded to administer to the members of the College the oath\r\nof obedience to the statutes. Ten of the thirty-six members, it\r\nappears, at first refused compliance, and were for a time suspended,\r\nby the founder’s command, from the benefits of the society. In the\r\nfollowing year Waynflete himself came to visit the College, and there\r\nreceived the King, who came from Woodstock to Oxford to inspect the\r\nnew foundation, and passed the night within its walls. Some further\r\nstatutes, chiefly concerning elections and admissions, were issued\r\nby the founder in 1482, in which year a large number of Fellows\r\nand Demies[199] were formally admitted, and the society regularly\r\norganized, though its numbers were not yet fixed. In 1483, Richard\r\nIII. visited the College, being received, as Edward had been, by the\r\nfounder, and disputations were held before him, at his desire, in the\r\nCollege Hall, in one of which William Grocyn took part. At this time\r\nthe founder delivered to the College the whole body of the statutes\r\nwhich he had framed, reserving to himself, however, the right to add to\r\nthem or revise them as he should see fit.\r\n\r\nThe regulations thus made for the government of the society, provided\r\nthat it should consist of a President, forty Fellows, thirty Demies,\r\nfour chaplains, eight clerks, sixteen choristers, a schoolmaster,\r\nand an usher. The Fellows were to be chosen from certain counties\r\nand dioceses; the Demies, in the first instance, from places where\r\nthe College had property bestowed by the founder or acquired in his\r\nlifetime. The Demies were not to be less than twelve years of age at\r\nthe time of their election, and were not to retain their places after\r\nreaching the age of twenty-five years. The system by which Demies\r\nsucceeded to vacant Fellowships was the growth of later custom, and was\r\nnot provided for by the statutes. The schoolmaster and usher were to\r\ngive instruction in grammar to the junior Demies, and to all others who\r\nshould resort to them. Provision was made for the teaching of moral and\r\nof natural philosophy, and of theology, by the appointment of readers\r\nin these subjects, whose lectures were to be open to all students,\r\nwhether members of the College or not. Besides the foundation members\r\nof the College, the statutes allowed the admission of commoners of\r\nnoble family, whose numbers were not to exceed twenty, and who might be\r\nallowed to live in the College at the charge of their relations. The\r\nregulations as to the dress, conduct, and discipline of the College\r\nwere based upon those laid down in the statutes given by William of\r\nWykeham to New College, from which society a Fellow, or former Fellow,\r\nmight be chosen as President. Save for this exception, no one who had\r\nnot been a Fellow of Magdalen College was to be accounted eligible for\r\nthat office.\r\n\r\nThe endowments of the College, besides the property which was derived\r\nfrom the Hospital of St. John Baptist, and that which had been\r\noriginally settled upon the Hall, consisted partly of lands acquired\r\nby Waynflete for the purpose, partly of the endowments of other\r\nfoundations which were united or annexed to the College at different\r\ntimes as the Hospital of St. John had been. These were the Hospital of\r\nSS. John and James at Brackley in Northamptonshire, the Priory of Sele\r\nin Sussex,[200] the Hospital of Aynho, a hospital or chantry at Romney,\r\nthe Chapel of St. Katharine at Wanborough, and the Priory of Selborne\r\nin Hampshire.[201] An intended foundation at Caister in Norfolk, for\r\nwhich Sir John Fastolf had provided by his will, was by Waynflete’s\r\ninfluence diverted to augment the foundation of the College. The\r\nFellowships to be held by persons born in the dioceses of York and\r\nDurham, or in the county of York, were partly provided for by special\r\nbenefactions from Thomas Ingledew, one of Waynflete’s chaplains, and by\r\nJohn Forman, one of the Fellows of St. Mary Magdalen Hall.\r\n\r\nBesides the endowments which Waynflete bestowed on his College during\r\nhis lifetime, he bequeathed to it by will all his manors, lands, and\r\ntenements, with one exception; and he further recommended it to the\r\nspecial care of his executors, directing that they should bestow upon\r\nit a share of the residue of his estate.\r\n\r\nThe royal favour which had been shown towards the College during\r\nWaynflete’s life was continued after his decease (which took place on\r\nAugust 11th, 1486), by Henry VII., who visited the College in 1487 or\r\n1488, and is still annually commemorated on May 1st as a benefactor,\r\non account, as it would seem, of his having secured to the College the\r\nadvowsons of Findon in Sussex, and Slymbridge in Gloucestershire, and\r\nhaving directed that the latter benefice should be charged with an\r\nannual payment for the benefit of the College.[202] Henry also extended\r\nhis patronage to the President, Richard Mayew, whom he employed in\r\nmany matters of state business, appointing him to be his almoner, and\r\nalso to be his Procurator-general at the Court of Rome. Mayew also\r\nheld during his Presidentship several ecclesiastical offices. In 1501\r\nhe was sent to Spain to conduct the Infanta Katharine, about to be\r\nmarried to Arthur, Prince of Wales, to England. This marriage forms one\r\nof the subjects depicted in some pieces of tapestry still preserved\r\nin the President’s lodgings, which are believed to have been a gift\r\nbestowed upon Mayew by Prince Arthur, who twice at least took up his\r\nabode in the College, and was entertained by the President on his\r\nvisits. Mayew’s non-academical employments must have necessitated his\r\nrepeated absence from his duties as President; and at last, after his\r\nelection to the See of Hereford, a dispute seems to have arisen as to\r\nthe compatibility of his episcopal and academical functions. A party\r\namong the Fellows, headed by Stokesley, afterwards Bishop of London,\r\nwho was then Vice-President, declared that by the fact of Mayew’s\r\nconsecration the office of President had become vacant, and at last\r\nobtained from Bishop Fox of Winchester, the Visitor of the College,\r\na decision in favour of their own view. Mayew, in the meantime,\r\nhad attempted to assert his authority as President in a manner not\r\naltogether in accordance with the statutes, and it became necessary\r\nfor the Bishop of Winchester to hold a formal visitation of the\r\nCollege. This he did by a Commissary, and the records of the Visitation\r\ncontain many extraordinary charges made by the partizans on each side.\r\nStokesley himself was accused, among other things, of having taken\r\npart in some magical incantations, including the baptizing of a cat,\r\nin order to discover hidden treasure. The cat, it may be remarked, is\r\nsometimes described as _cattus_, sometimes with more elegant Latinity\r\nas _murilegus_. These proceedings were alleged to have taken place\r\nin Yorkshire; concerning the more immediate affairs of the College,\r\nit appears that the strife between the parties had run so high, that\r\nsome of the Fellows went about the cloisters with armour offensive and\r\ndefensive. The general result of the Visitation was the acquittal of\r\nStokesley, who cleared himself from all charges to the satisfaction\r\nof the Commissary. Bishop Mayew retired from the Presidentship, and\r\nwas succeeded early in 1507 by John Claymond, formerly Fellow, one of\r\nthe many distinguished men who were members of the College during the\r\nquarter of a century over which Mayew’s term of office had extended.\r\nAmong other members of the College under Mayew’s rule may be mentioned\r\nthe celebrated Grocyn, who was Praelector in Divinity, Richard Fox\r\n(already referred to as Bishop of Winchester), John Colet, afterwards\r\nDean of St. Paul’s, and Thomas Wolsey--the last, perhaps, the most\r\ncelebrated man whom the College has produced. It was during Mayew’s\r\nPresidentship that the Tower, sometimes attributed to Wolsey,[203] was\r\nbuilt, and that the cloister on the south side of the quadrangle was\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Wolsey in the King’s favour secured the College a friend\r\nat Court whose influence was for a time more powerful than that of\r\neither Waynflete or Mayew had been. He was appointed one of the King’s\r\nchaplains, and employed by Henry VII. in some important missions.\r\nSoon after the accession of Henry VIII. he became almoner, and “ruled\r\nall under the King.” Throughout the time of his prosperity he kept up\r\nfriendly relations with the College, and frequent exchanges of presents\r\ntook place between him and its members. The first Dean of his College\r\nin Oxford was John Hygden, who had succeeded Claymond as President of\r\nMagdalen; and several members of Magdalen College were among the first\r\nCanons of Cardinal College.\r\n\r\nAnother new foundation closely connected with Magdalen College was\r\nthe College of Corpus Christi, founded by Richard Fox, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, who not only induced Claymond to become the first President\r\nof his new society, but closely imitated Waynflete’s statutes in those\r\nwhich he gave to Corpus Christi College. These statutes provided\r\nthat the students of Theology and Bachelors of Arts of Corpus Christi\r\nCollege should attend lectures at Magdalen--the lectures intended being\r\nno doubt those of the Praelectors or readers established by Waynflete,\r\nwho occupied a position not unlike that of the University Professors of\r\na later time. It was perhaps with a view to the advantages afforded by\r\nthese lectures that a further direction enjoined the members of Corpus\r\nChristi College, if compelled by a visitation of the plague to move\r\nfrom Oxford, to take up their quarters near the place where the members\r\nof Magdalen College had settled for the time. The second President of\r\nCorpus Christi College, Robert Morwent, had been Vice-President of\r\nMagdalen, and had migrated with Claymond to take charge of Fox’s infant\r\nfoundation. These two Presidents of Corpus, with John Hygden, first\r\nDean of Cardinal College and of Christ Church, joined together in a\r\nbenefaction to their former society. They made provision for the yearly\r\ndistribution to its members of a sum of money, which was to be, and\r\nstill is, distributed by the bursar in the chapel during the singing of\r\nBenedictus on the first Monday of every Lent.\r\n\r\nThe “revolution under the forms of law,” effected in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., of which Wolsey’s fall was the beginning, had no great direct\r\neffect upon the College. Indirectly, however, the suppression of the\r\nreligious houses was a cause of considerable expense. The College had\r\npermitted the Carmelites of Shoreham, whose house was much decayed,\r\nto occupy their annexed Priory of Sele; and it was perhaps only in\r\naccordance with the justice of the King’s proceedings that the Priory\r\nwas in consequence treated as a Carmelite house, and the College\r\ncompelled to buy back its own property from the persons to whom Henry\r\nhad granted it. A less important expenditure involved by the King’s\r\nproceedings was incurred by the provision of new painted glass, no\r\ndoubt to replace portions of the chapel windows which had been defaced\r\nby the King’s commissioners as containing emblems derogatory of his\r\nMajesty’s supremacy. The “linen-fold” panelling of the hall appears\r\nto have been placed in its present position in the year 1541; it is\r\nsaid to have come from Reading Abbey, but the groups of figures, the\r\nheraldic ornaments, and the not too flattering effigy of Henry VIII.,\r\nwhich are now inserted in it, were probably designed for the decoration\r\nof the Hall. Except for the acquisition of this wood-work, the College\r\nseems to have received nothing from the spoil of the religious orders.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Edward VI., and the visitation of the University,\r\nbrought serious trouble upon the College. The President, Owen\r\nOglethorpe, was apparently prepared to accept the earlier stages of\r\nthe Reformation movement, but he was not prepared to go so far as\r\nthe party in power required. Some members of the College were of the\r\nmore advanced school of the Reformers; and much irreverence, with a\r\ngood deal of wanton destruction, was committed by them, encouraged by\r\nletters from the Protector inciting the College to the “redress of\r\nreligion.” Oglethorpe was removed from the office of President, into\r\nwhich Walter Haddon, a person not eligible according to the statutes,\r\nwas intruded, in spite of a petition from the Fellows, and the work of\r\nreformation proceeded according to the desire of the Council. Haddon is\r\nsaid to have sold many of the effects of the chapel, valued at about\r\n£1000, for about a twentieth part of that sum, and to have “consumed\r\non alterations” not only the sum so received, but a larger sum of the\r\n“public money” of the College. It was fortunate for the society that\r\nthe scheme of the Council for the total suppression of the choir, and\r\nthe alienation of a corresponding part of the College revenue, had been\r\npromulgated while Oglethorpe was still President. Under his guidance,\r\nwith considerable difficulty, the College managed to preserve this part\r\nof its foundation unimpaired.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the accession of Queen Mary, Walter Haddon received,\r\nas appears from the Vice-President’s register, leave of absence on\r\nurgent private affairs, and his example was soon followed by those\r\nof the Fellows who had been especially notable for their zeal in the\r\n“redress of religion.” Laurence Humphrey, one of this party, obtained\r\nleave for the express purpose of conveying himself _in transmarinas\r\npartes_; and this leave of absence was continued to him at a later time\r\nprovided that he did not resort to those towns which were known to be\r\nthe refuge of heretics. He took up his abode forthwith at Zürich. As\r\nhe was absent from the College during the whole of Mary’s reign, he is\r\nperhaps not a sufficient witness of the events of that time. He asserts\r\nthat the Roman party had great difficulty in re-establishing the old\r\norder of things in College, and that the younger members of the society\r\nsuffered many things at their hands. Of all this, however, there is no\r\nevidence in the Vice-President’s register, where most of the offences\r\nand almost all the penalties recorded during this period are of an\r\nordinary kind.[204] Oglethorpe was restored to his Presidency, and was\r\nsucceeded on his elevation to the See of Carlisle, by Arthur Cole, a\r\nCanon of Windsor.[205] During the tenure of Cole, and of his successor\r\nThomas Coveney (whom the College chose in preference to three persons\r\nrecommended by the Queen), there appear to have been differences of\r\nopinion on religious matters within the College, and some difficulties\r\nin enforcing the due attendance of its members at the chapel services;\r\nbut there is no sign of what might be called a tendency to persecution\r\non the part of the authorities. The most recalcitrant members of the\r\nsociety seem to have been the Bachelor Demies and Probationer Fellows.\r\nCoveney remained President for some time after Queen Elizabeth’s\r\ncoronation by Oglethorpe; and in the interval between that event and\r\nthe consecration of Archbishop Parker there are some indications in the\r\nregister of religious strife within the College. The end of Coveney’s\r\nterm of office was marked by a contest between himself and some of the\r\nFellows, concerning matters of College business, in which he seems\r\nto have exceeded his power as President. He was deprived by Bishop\r\nHorn at a Visitation in 1561, on the ground, it is said, that he was\r\na layman; but it might be at least doubtful whether the founder’s\r\nstatutes strictly required the President to be in Holy Orders; and it\r\nis probable that the real reason for his deprivation lay in the fact\r\nthat Horn regarded him as being too much “addicted to the Popish\r\nsuperstition.”\r\n\r\nThis fault at all events could not be laid to the charge of Laurence\r\nHumphrey, who succeeded him. Horn himself had reported that the members\r\nof the College, whom he expected to find of the same school as their\r\nPresident, were willing to accept the tests he proposed to them--to\r\nacknowledge the Queen’s supremacy, and to accept the Book of Common\r\nPrayer, and the Advertisements. Before Humphrey had been long President\r\nthe College had ceased to be “conformable,” but its non-conformity was\r\nof the Puritan, not of the Romanizing, type. Humphrey himself had a\r\nstrong objection to wearing a surplice, or using his proper academical\r\ndress, and many of his Fellows followed his example in this matter.\r\nIt required more than one Visitation to induce compliance on such\r\nmatters. Abuses of another kind, however, were left uncorrected, and\r\neven encouraged, by the Visitors. Many Fellowships were filled up by\r\nnominations from the Queen, or from the Bishop of Winchester, and it\r\nmay be added that the persons nominated were not always model members\r\nof a College. There were many contentions between the Fellows, and\r\nbetween the President and the Fellows. The general impression given\r\nby reading the register of the time of Humphrey and his immediate\r\nsuccessors is, that the College was becoming a home of disorder rather\r\nthan of learning. Nicolas Bond, Humphrey’s successor, seems, however,\r\nin 1589 to have made some rather ineffectual efforts to provide for\r\nmore regular and systematic study among its members. During his tenure\r\nof office the society received a visit from King James I., accompanied\r\nby his son Henry, then Prince of Wales, who was matriculated as a\r\nmember of the College. The King was much impressed by the buildings,\r\nand greatly enjoyed his visit. The grotesque figures or “hieroglyphics”\r\nin the Cloister Quadrangle were painted, as it would seem, in honour of\r\nhis coming, Moses in particular being adorned _toga coerulea_.\r\n\r\nThe College, which was Puritan under Humphrey, was even more Puritan\r\nunder Bond, Harding, and Langton; with Langton’s successor, however, in\r\n1626, the tide set in the contrary direction. Accepted Frewen, if, as\r\nhis name suggests, he was of Puritan descent, was himself a supporter\r\nof Laud’s ecclesiastical policy, and acted with vigour both as\r\nPresident in his own College and as Vice-Chancellor in the University,\r\nfor the restoration of discipline and good order. The numbers of the\r\nCollege had been increased during his predecessor’s time by the influx\r\nof a number of so-called “poor scholars,” whose connection with the\r\nCollege was very slight, and who seem to have in many cases been\r\nentered as members of the society by the mere authority of the person\r\nto whom they had attached themselves. Frewen made regulations on this\r\nsubject, and these seem to have been re-inforced a few years later by\r\na letter from the Visitor. Other matters he also took in hand with\r\ngood effect, especially the restoration of the chapel, on which he\r\nseems to have spent large sums of his own, in addition to the corporate\r\nexpenditure of the College. The windows of the ante-chapel (except the\r\ngreat west window) were part of Frewen’s work, the only part which has\r\nbeen left by the later restoration of 1832.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Great Rebellion found the College converted from\r\na nest of Puritans into a nest of Royalists and High Churchmen.\r\nThe King’s demand for loans of money and plate was met with some\r\ndifficulty, but without hesitation, by a loan of £1000 in money and\r\nby the delivery of plate to the value of about £1000 more. When the\r\nParliamentary forces entered Oxford in September 1642 they found at\r\nMagdalen “certain Cavaliers in scholars’ habits,” who had “feathers and\r\nbuff-coats” in their chambers. Some of the scholars, being malignant\r\npersons, “scoffed” at the invaders and “at the honourable Houses of\r\nParliament,” and were accordingly made prisoners. Other members of the\r\nCollege had left Oxford a few days before with Byron’s horse, to join\r\nthe King: among them was John Nourse, Fellow and Doctor of Civil Law,\r\nwho fell at Edgehill. After that action the King entered Oxford, and\r\nPrince Rupert took up his quarters at Magdalen. The King’s artillery\r\nwas placed in Magdalen College Grove, which served as a drill-ground\r\nfor the regiment of scholars and strangers which was raised in 1644;\r\nbatteries were erected in the Walks, and gunners exercised in the\r\nCollege meadows. The timber in the Grove was probably felled for use\r\nin the defensive works.[206] A curious contrast to this military\r\npreparation was furnished by the imposing ceremonial of Frewen’s\r\nconsecration as Bishop of Lichfield, which took place in the chapel of\r\nthe College in April 1644.[207]\r\n\r\nSome members of the College were as active on the side of the\r\nParliament as those who remained in Oxford were on the side of the\r\nKing. A Demy named Lidcott was deprived of his place for having been\r\nin arms against the King, serving in Essex’s army as an “antient” of a\r\nfoot company. A far more celebrated member of the Parliamentary party,\r\nJohn Hampden, had formerly been a member of the College which was the\r\nhead-quarters of the commander of the troops against whom he fought at\r\nChalgrove.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Oxford, considerable havoc was wrought in the\r\nchapel of the College by the Parliamentary troops, who destroyed,\r\namong other things, the glass of many of the windows. The organ was\r\nappropriated by Cromwell to his own use, and removed by him to Hampton\r\nCourt, whence it was brought again after the Restoration.[208] The\r\nParliamentary Visitors of the University found few members of the\r\nCollege willing to submit to their authority. The President, Dr.\r\nJohn Oliver, and the greater part of the members were ejected, and\r\nthe bursar, who obstinately refused to give up keys or papers, was\r\nimprisoned. The tenants of the College, however, persisted in paying\r\ntheir rents to him, and special injunctions had to be given to prevent\r\nthem from doing so. The places in College rendered vacant by expulsions\r\nwere filled up by the importation of Independents and Presbyterians,\r\nDr. John Wilkinson, a former Fellow, being made President. He\r\nwas succeeded two years later by Goodwin, a gloomy person, whose\r\nexamination of a candidate for a Demyship has been recounted by\r\nAddison in the _Spectator_.[209] The records of the events in College\r\nduring the Commonwealth are very scanty. One of the most remarkable\r\nproceedings of the intruders was the appropriation and division among\r\nthemselves of a sum of money which they found in the muniment-room;\r\nthis was the fund provided by the Founder for special necessities,\r\nwhich had remained untouched since 1585, and the existence of which had\r\nperhaps been forgotten. It was for the most part in ancient coinage,\r\nthe pieces being of the kind known as “spur royals.” Of these a hundred\r\nfell to the share of Wilkinson, who seems to have been the instigator\r\nof the division; nine hundred more were divided among the thirty\r\nFellows, and the Demies and others, including the servants, received\r\nportions of the spoil. Before the Restoration, however, some of the\r\nrecipients restored the pieces they had obtained, and the greater\r\npart of the money was actually repaid in course of time. The fund,\r\nunder more modern financial arrangements, no longer remains in the\r\nmuniment-room, but some of the old coins are still preserved there.\r\n\r\nOn the Restoration the ejected members of the College, or those who\r\nwere left, were restored to their home. They included the President,\r\nseventeen Fellows and eight Demies.[210] Dr. Oliver, however, did not\r\nlong survive his return; and upon his death began a time of trouble.\r\nCharles II. recommended as his successor Dr. Thomas Pierce, a divine\r\nwho had done much service in the defence of the Church against her\r\nassailants, but whom the Fellows, who perhaps knew him better than\r\nthe King were unwilling, as it seems, to elect. Charles however\r\nenforced obedience by a letter as peremptory as any communication\r\nwhich the College afterwards received from his brother, and Dr. Pierce\r\nbecame President. The result was a long warfare between Pierce, the\r\nFellows, and the Visitor, Bishop Morley, whose intentions seem to have\r\nbeen better than his judgment. At last the King interfered, and the\r\ndifficulty was solved by the promotion of Dr. Pierce to the Deanery\r\nof Salisbury, where he found scope for his energies in a controversy\r\nwith his Bishop. Dr. Henry Clerk was now recommended by the King, and\r\nelected by the Fellows, and the society was at peace for some years.\r\nThat peace was again disturbed, on Dr. Clerk’s death, by the action of\r\nJames II., who attempted to force upon the College as its President a\r\nman unqualified by statute and disqualified by notorious immorality.\r\nThe history of the struggle which followed is too well known to need\r\nrepetition here.[211] The Fellows almost unanimously chose one of their\r\nown number, and supported him, when duly elected, against the King’s\r\nsecond nominee. In the end, after a year’s exile, they were restored to\r\ntheir College, under Dr. John Hough, the President of their own choice,\r\nby the Bishop of Winchester, acting on instructions from the King.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution brought with it new causes of disquiet, and some members\r\nof the College were again ejected as Nonjurors. The great majority,\r\nhowever, of those who had contended against the usurpation of James\r\nwere content to submit themselves to the new Sovereigns, and retained\r\ntheir places. The most notable member who was thus lost to the College\r\nwas Dr. Thomas Smith, a man of much learning and ability, and a steady\r\nand uncompromising Royalist. In 1689 occurred what was afterwards known\r\nas the “Golden Election” of Demies, which included, besides others\r\nless known, Hugh Boulter, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, Smallbrook,\r\nafterwards Bishop of St. David’s and later of Lichfield, the notorious\r\nHenry Sacheverell, and Joseph Addison, the most celebrated member of\r\nthe College since the Revolution. The residence of Addison in College\r\nwas not prolonged beyond his year of probation as Fellow; but he has\r\nleft a memory of himself in the fact that his name has been attached to\r\na portion of the Walks. These it would seem in his time did not extend\r\nbeyond what is now called Addison’s Walk, but was formerly known as\r\n“Dover Pier.”\r\n\r\nThe members of the College who remained seem to have maintained\r\nfriendly relations with those who had withdrawn from it as Nonjurors,\r\nand even at this time, and certainly after the accession of George I.,\r\nthe sympathy of many among the Fellows was with the exiled rather than\r\nwith the reigning branch of the Royal House. During the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth century, indeed, politics flourished in the society\r\nmore than learning; and although Gibbon’s picture of the condition\r\nof the College during his brief residence is rather highly coloured,\r\nit cannot be doubted that the general decline of academic activity\r\nwhich affected many of the Colleges in Oxford during the last century,\r\naffected Magdalen in no slight degree. A large part of the attention of\r\nthe society seems to have been given to plans for the rearrangement or\r\nthe destruction of the College buildings, and for the re-construction\r\nof the College on the pattern adopted in what are known as the “New\r\nBuildings,” erected in 1735. Some amazing designs for “College\r\nimprovements” remain in the library, as a memorial of the architectural\r\nambitions of this period. Among the Presidents of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, if we except Dr. Routh, whose lengthened tenure extended over\r\nthe last years of that century and the first half of the nineteenth,\r\nthere is but one name of mark--that of George Horne, afterwards Bishop\r\nof Norwich, once widely-known by his Commentary on the Psalms. Nor are\r\nthere many names of mark among the other members of the College in the\r\nsame century. The learning of Dr. Routh does not seem to have been\r\nshared in any conspicuous degree by more than a small proportion of\r\nthose who passed through the College in his long Presidentship--though\r\ntowards the end of that period Magdalen numbered among its members\r\nseveral men of note in different ways--James Mozley and William Palmer\r\namong theologians, Ferrier among philosophers, Roundell Palmer, now\r\nLord Selborne, among lawyers, Conington among scholars, Charles Reade\r\namong novelists, Goldwin Smith among essayists, Charles Daubeny among\r\nthose who laboured to advance the study of natural science.\r\n\r\nOf the changes which have been brought about in the College since the\r\ndays of Routh, of its transformation from a small society of Fellows\r\nand Demies into one of the larger among the Colleges in Oxford, it is\r\nhardly possible to speak as of history. They are changes of the present\r\nday. But it is a matter of history, which ought not to be forgotten,\r\nthat the College, which has owed much to its Presidents in the past,\r\nowes much in this matter to its last President, who governed it during\r\nthe trying times of two University Commissions, and of the changes\r\nwhich resulted from them. By his own example of the loyal acceptance\r\nof what was necessary, even when it was uncongenial to his tastes,\r\nand by the kindly sympathy which enabled him to reconcile conflicting\r\ninterests, he did more to preserve the peace of his College, and to\r\npromote its progress, than he would himself have thought possible, or\r\nthan those to whom he was less well known than to the members of his\r\nown College would have been inclined to imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nBRASENOSE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n(_Aula Regia et Collegium de Brasenose, Collegium Aenei Nasi._)\r\n\r\nBY FALCONER MADAN, M.A., FELLOW OF BRASENOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE KING’S HALL OF BRAZEN-NOSE.\r\n\r\n(_Aula Regia de Brasinnose._)\r\n\r\nProfessor Holland has given a clear account[212] of the three stages\r\nthrough which a University passes, first as _scholae_, where there is\r\n“a more or less fortuitous gathering of teachers and students”; next\r\nas a _studium generale_, when the teachers become “a sort of guild\r\nof masters or doctors,” with control over the admission by a degree\r\nto their own body; and lastly as a _Universitas_, when the society\r\n“acquires a corporate existence,” with a well-defined constitution\r\nand privileges. The first and second of these stages were attained by\r\nOxford in the twelfth century, and the third early in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. It is early in this latter century that we also find the\r\nearliest associations of students among themselves. The system of Halls\r\nwas due to the desire of the poorer class of students to live for\r\neconomy’s sake in a common house with common meals, under the charge of\r\na Principal whose duty was quite as much to manage household affairs\r\nas to superintend the studies of his scholars.[213]\r\n\r\nThe existence of the house which became Brasenose Hall may be carried\r\nback with certainty to the second quarter of the thirteenth century,\r\nthe earliest facts at present known being that it belonged, in or\r\nbefore A. D. 1239,[214] to one Jeffry Jussell, and that it passed\r\ninto the hands of Simon de Balindon, who sold it in about 1261 to the\r\nChancellor and Masters of the University, for the use of the scholars\r\nenjoying the benefaction of William of Durham. Soon after this purchase\r\nthe occupier, Andrew the son of Andrew of Durham, was forcibly ejected\r\nby Adam Bilet and his scholars, and no doubt at this time, if not\r\nearlier, the tenement acquired the name of Brasenose, and was used as\r\nschools, for in 1278 an Inquisition[215] says, “Item eadem Universitas\r\n[Oxon.] habet quandam aliam domum que vocatur Brasenose cum quatuor\r\nScholis … et taxantur ad octo marcas, et fuit illa domus aliquo tempore\r\nGalfridi Jussell.” The transition from these Scholae or lecture-rooms\r\nto a Hall cannot now be traced, but no doubt took place within the same\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1334 a striking incident occurred in the history\r\nof the Hall. Under stress of internal faction, and not on this\r\noccasion, it would seem, from excesses on the part of the citizens,\r\nthere was a migration of a large number of the students of the\r\nUniversity from Oxford to Stamford, fulfilling the (later!) prophecy of\r\nMerlin--\r\n\r\n    “Doctrinae studium quae nunc viget ad Vada Boum\r\n    Tempore venturo celebrabitur ad Vada Saxi.”\r\n\r\nBut of all the emigrants the only men who kept together were the\r\nstudents of Brasenose Hall, as is evidenced by the existence at\r\nStamford to this day of a fourteenth century archway, belonging to an\r\nancient hall called for centuries “Brasenose Hall in Stamford,” the\r\nrefectory of which was standing till A.D. 1688,[216] and still more by\r\na brass knocker which is assigned by antiquaries to the early part of\r\nthe twelfth century, and which from time immemorial hung on the doors\r\nof the Stamford gateway. It is reasonable to suppose that the knocker\r\nhad originally given a name to the Oxford Hall, and had been carried\r\nas a visible sign of unity to the distant Lincolnshire town.[217] The\r\nKing used all his power to force the students to return to Oxford, and\r\nin a final commission in July, 1335, the name of “Philippus obsonator\r\nEneanasensis” occurs among the thirty-seven who resisted to the last\r\nthe mandates of the King.[218]\r\n\r\nThe list of Principals of Brasenose is preserved from 1435 onwards (see\r\np. 271), but little or nothing is recorded of the life of the Hall. Its\r\nflourishing state may be inferred from its vigorous annexation of the\r\nsurrounding buildings, as Little St. Edmund Hall, Little University\r\nHall, and St. Thomas Hall. An inventory of the furniture belonging to\r\nMaster Thomas Cooper of Brasenose Hall, who died in 1438, is printed in\r\nAnstey’s _Munimenta Academica_, ii. 515. The Vice-Chancellor in 1480-82\r\nwas William Sutton, Principal of Brasenose Hall, and Proctors in 1458\r\n(John Molineux) and 1502 (Hugh Hawarden) were Brasenose men.\r\n\r\nThe new College, founded in 1509, was in several special ways a\r\ncontinuation of, and not merely a substitute for, the old Hall. The\r\nsite of the Hall was exactly at the principal gateway of the College;\r\nit had already annexed many of the adjacent buildings required for\r\nthe new erection, and the last Principal of the Hall was the first\r\nPrincipal of the College. It may fairly be claimed therefore that there\r\nis a real succession, both of name and fame, from the one to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE FOUNDERS OF BRASENOSE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smyth, the chief founder of Brasenose, was the fourth son of\r\nRobert Smyth, of Peel House, in Widnes (Lancashire), and belonged to\r\na Cuerdley family. Of the date of his birth, early education, and\r\ncareer at Oxford nothing whatever is certainly known. In 1492 when he\r\nwas instituted to the Rectory of Cheshunt, he was a Bachelor of Law.\r\nThrough the influence of the Stanley family, and of Margaret, Countess\r\nof Richmond, Smyth obtained promotion both in civil and ecclesiastical\r\nlines, until in 1491 he was elected Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield.\r\nIn the closing years of the fifteenth century he presided over the\r\nPrince of Wales’s Council in the Marches of Wales, and was President\r\nof Wales in 1501 or 1502. In Lichfield he founded, in 1495, a Hospital\r\nof St. John, which has preserved a portrait of him almost identical\r\nwith the one owned by the College. In the same year he was translated\r\nto Lincoln. The Bishop’s connection with Oxford was renewed in 1500,\r\nat the end of which year he was elected Chancellor, retaining the\r\noffice till August, 1503. This link with the University had great\r\nresults, for in 1507 the Bishop established a new Fellowship in Oriel,\r\nendowed Lincoln College with two estates, and formed his plans with a\r\nview to the foundation of Brasenose. After that event there is little\r\nof importance to notice in his public life before his death on 2nd\r\nJanuary, 1513/4.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Sutton, Knight, the co-Founder of Brasenose, and the first\r\nlay founder of any College, was of the family of Sutton, of Sutton\r\nnear Macclesfield, and probably a kinsman of William Sutton, Principal\r\nof Brasenose Hall in and after 1469; but no connection can be traced\r\nbetween this family and the wealthy Thomas Sutton who founded the\r\nCharterhouse a century later. Of his birth and education there is no\r\nrecord, but he was a Barrister of the Inner Temple and was made a Privy\r\nCouncillor in 1497. In 1513 he was Steward of the Monastery of Sion at\r\nIsleworth, a house of Brigittine nuns. At his expense Pynson printed\r\nthe _Orcharde of Syon_, a devotional book, in 1519. In 1522 or 1523 he\r\nreceived the honour of knighthood, and died in 1524.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE FOUNDATION AND EARLY STATUTES OF THE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nThe first record of the proposal to found Brasenose is contained in\r\nthe will of Edmund Croston, dated (four days before his death) on Jan.\r\n23, 1507/8, where are bequeathed £6 13_s._ 4_d._ to “the building\r\nof Brasynnose in Oxford, if such works as the Bishop of Lyncoln and\r\nMaster Sotton intended there went on during their life or within\r\ntwelve years after.” It is probable that the Bishop at one time\r\nintended that Lincoln College should enjoy his benefactions, for Robert\r\nParkinson, Sub-rector of Lincoln, wrote about 1566-69, “Proposuerat\r\nenim [episcopus], ut ferunt, omnia nostro collegio praestitisse quae\r\npostea in Brasinnos egit, si voluissent R[ector] et S[cholares] qui tum\r\nfuerunt ab eo propositas conditiones recipere.”\r\n\r\nThe actual foundation can be best shown in the form of annals, it being\r\nunderstood that the disposition of the halls mentioned was nearly as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n   HIGH\r\n  STREET.\r\n     |\r\n   | V |                                                       |\r\n   |   |                                                     | |\r\n   |   +---------+---------+                         --------+ |\r\n   |   |         |         |       |       |           ST.   | |\r\n   |   | HABER-  |         |       |Garden |         THOMAS  | |\r\n   |   | DASHER  |         |       |       |          HALL   | | EXETER\r\n   |   |  HALL   | LITTLE  |  ST.  |SALIS- |                 | | COLLEGE\r\n   |   |(Oseney) |   ST.   |MARY’S | BURY  | BRAZE- +--------+ | GARDEN\r\n   |   |         | EDMUND  | ENTRY | HALL  | NOSE   |LITTLE  | |\r\n   |   +---------+  HALL   |       |       | HALL   | UNI-   | |\r\n   |   |         |(Oseney) |(Oriel)|(Oriel)|        |VERSITY | |\r\n   |   | Garden  |         |       |       |        | HALL   | |\r\n   |   |         |         |       |       | (Univ. |Coll.)  | |\r\n   |   +---------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+ +--------+\r\n  -+                         SCHOOL STREET.                             |\r\n       +---------------+ +----------+-----------+---------+-----------+ |\r\n  -+   |               | |          |<- 58 ft.->|         |           | |\r\n   |   |  ST.

The College agreed to renew the lease and to\r\ngive over all their rights, as soon as property of the annual value\r\nof £3 should be given them. In 1514 Sutton assigned this lease to\r\ntrustees to carry out his purposes.\r\n\r\n1509, summer. Edward Moseley’s stone quarry at Headington is let to the\r\nfounders and Roland Messenger for their lives.\r\n\r\n1509, June 1. The foundation stone of the College is laid, as recorded\r\non a modern copy of the original inscription, now and probably always\r\nplaced over the doorway of Staircase No. 1, which used to lead to the\r\nfirst chapel of the College:--\r\n\r\n“Anno Christi 1509 et Regis Henrici octavi primo | Nomine diuino\r\nlincoln | presul quoque sutton . Hanc posu | ere petram regis ad\r\nimperium | primo die Iunii.”\r\n\r\n1509/10, Feb. 20. Oriel College lets Salisbury Hall and St. Mary’s\r\nEntry (Introitus S. Mariae) to Sutton and others for ever in\r\nconsideration of an annual rent of 13_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n1511/2, Jan. 15. A Charter of Foundation granted to Smyth and Sutton.\r\n\r\n1523, May 6. Sutton transfers the property acquired from University\r\nCollege in 1508, to the Principal and Fellows of Brazenose.\r\n\r\n1530, May 12. Haberdasher, Little St. Edmund, Glass and Black Halls are\r\ngranted to the College on a lease of ninety-six years by Oseney Abbey,\r\nthe first being at once converted by payment into the property of the\r\nCollege, but the others not till March 6, 1655/6.\r\n\r\n1556, Nov. 2. Staple Hall, which had once belonged to the Abbey of\r\nEynsham, is leased by Lincoln College to Brasenose for ever at a rent\r\nof 20_s._ per annum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Rome was not built in a day,” and it is curious to note how the old\r\nand new foundations overlap each other. The College building clearly\r\nbegan at the south-west corner of the present front quadrangle, and\r\nBrasenose Hall was no doubt left until the building naturally reached\r\nit. Thus John Formby was Principal of the Hall till Aug. 24, 1510,\r\nwhen Matthew Smyth succeeded him, and in Smyth’s name on Sept. 9,\r\n1511 Roland Messenger still became surety for the dues payable by the\r\nHall to the University, for the ensuing year; and even on Sept. 9,\r\n1512, Smyth himself “cautioned,” as it was called, for the moribund\r\nhall. Moreover, a scholar of the Hall was locked up in August 1512\r\nfor interfering with the workmen who were building Corpus. The first\r\noccasion on which the College appears in the University Registers is\r\nin Sept. 1514, when Matthew Smyth, “Principal of the College or Hall\r\nof Brasen Nose” is mentioned; but there is evidence that the corporate\r\naction of the College dates from at least as early as Nov. 1512. We\r\nthus have before us the successive steps by which a College gradually\r\ngrew, and literally piece by piece took the place of the precedent\r\nHalls.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to turn to the statutes, the buildings being reserved\r\nfor a later section.\r\n\r\nThe Charter of Foundation is dated Jan. 15, 1511/2, and the original\r\nstatutes were no doubt shortly after drawn up and ratified by the two\r\nfounders, but no copy of them remains. Bishop Smyth’s executors in\r\nabout 1514 revised and signed a modification of the code, which still\r\nexists, and finally at the request of the College Sir Richard Sutton\r\nonce more revised them, on Feb. 1, 1521/2.\r\n\r\nAs in conception and in form of buildings, so in respect of their\r\nstatutes also, Merton and New College are the two cardinal foundations.\r\nFrom the latter were derived the statutes of Magdalen, founded in 1458,\r\nand from these latter the earliest statutes of Brasenose. The general\r\nsense of the Code of 1514 with Sutton’s changes in 1522, can be well\r\ngathered from the Churton’s abstract in his _Lives of … (the) Founders\r\nof Brazen Nose College_ (Oxf. 1800), pp. 315-40. The preamble is as\r\nfollows, the original being in Latin--\r\n\r\n“In the name of the Holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy\r\nSpirit, and of the most blessed Mother of God, Mary the glorious\r\nVirgin, and of Saints Hugh and Chad confessors, and also of St. Michael\r\nthe archangel: We, William Smyth, bishop of Lincoln, and Richard\r\nSutton, esquire, confiding in the aid of the supreme Creator, who\r\nknows, directs and disposes the wills of all that trust in him, do out\r\nof the goods which in this life, not by our merits, but by the grace\r\nof His fulness, we have received abundantly, by royal authority and\r\ncharter found, institute and establish in the University of Oxford, a\r\nperpetual College of poor and indigent scholars, who shall study and\r\nmake progress in philosophy and sacred theology; commonly called _The\r\nKing’s Haule and Colledge of Brasennose in Oxford_; to the praise,\r\nglory, and honour of Almighty God, of the glorious Virgin Mary, Saints\r\nHugh and Chad confessors, St. Michael the Archangel and All Saints; for\r\nthe support and exaltation of the Christian Faith, for the advancement\r\nof holy church, and for the furtherance of divine worship.”\r\n\r\nThe College is to consist of a Principal and twelve Fellows, all of\r\nthem born within the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield; with preference\r\nto the natives of the counties of Lancaster and Chester; and especially\r\nto the natives of the parish of Prescot in Lancashire, and of Prestbury\r\nin Cheshire. One of the senior Fellows is annually to be elected\r\nVice-Principal; and two others Bursars. The only language tolerated for\r\npublic use, unless when strangers are present, is Latin. The Bishop of\r\nLincoln has always been the Visitor.\r\n\r\nThus Brasenose started fairly on its course, equipped with statutes,\r\nwith property from its founders and benefactors, and with students\r\ndrawn, as ever since until recently, chiefly from good families of\r\nCheshire and Lancashire, Leighs and Watsons, Lathams and Brookes and\r\nEgertons. But the history of a College which has not been at any time\r\npredominant in the University is both difficult and unnecessary to\r\ntrace; difficult from the paucity of records of its internal social\r\nlife, and unnecessary from the lack of general interest in the domestic\r\naffairs of one particular College among so many. It will be the task of\r\none who deals with the social life of Oxford to seize on those features\r\nof College history which from time to time best represent the character\r\nof successive periods: in this place it will suffice to give a few\r\nscenes or facts which being themselves of interest have also sufficient\r\nillustration from existing records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. FROM THE REFORMATION TO THE RESTORATION.\r\n\r\nIn the Bodleian (MS. Rawl. D. 985) there is a volume of copies of Latin\r\nletters written by Robert Batt of Brasenose, chiefly to a brother,\r\nin which among much of the usual rhetoric there is also curious\r\ninformation about the life of the College. They range from 1581 to\r\n1585, and we read of his complaints to the Principal because a junior\r\nman is put into his study (_musæum_), of an archery meeting at Oxford,\r\nwhich much distracts the young Batt, and of the visit of the Prince\r\nAlaskie to Oxford. He asks his Cambridge brother to come up for Commem,\r\nand with Yorkshire bluntness writes letters to the Master and a Fellow\r\nof University College, asking for a Fellowship!\r\n\r\nSo too in 1609-11 we find ten letters from Richard Taylor as tutor to\r\nSir Peter Legh’s son (Hist. Manuscripts Commission, _Report 3_, 1872,\r\np. 268), which throw light on College affairs and expenses of that time.\r\n\r\nIn the Register of the Parliamentary Visitors of the University from\r\n1647 to 1658 we obtain an insight into the condition of the College,\r\nwhich shows it to have been in a creditable state. At first the College\r\nis as Royalist as any, the proportion of submitters to those who\r\nwere willing to endure actual expulsion rather than acknowledge the\r\nVisitors’ rights, being probably only twelve to twenty-three, in May\r\n1648. Their Principal, Dr. Samuel Radcliffe, had already, on Jan. 6,\r\nbeen deprived of his office, and Daniel Greenwood, a submitter, had\r\nbeen on April 13, put in his place. But the spirit of the College is\r\nabundantly shown by the proceedings which ensued on Dr. Radcliffe’s\r\ndeath. Three days after that event, on June 29, the Society, to use\r\nWood’s words, “(taking no notice that the Visitors had entred Mr.\r\nGreenwood Principal) put up a citation on the Chappel door (as by\r\nStatute they were required) to summon the Fellows to election. The\r\nVisitors thereupon send for Mr. Thom. Sixsmith and two more Fellows\r\nof that House to command them to surcease and submit to their new\r\nPrincipal Mr. Greenwood; but they gave them fair words, went home,\r\nand within four days after [July 13] chose among themselves, in a\r\nFellow’s Chamber, at the West end of the old Library, Mr. Thom. Yate,\r\none of their Society.” The Visitors immediately deposed him, in favour\r\nof Greenwood; but at the Restoration Dr. Yate’s claims were at once\r\nrecognized, and he long enjoyed the headship. This resistance by\r\nthe Fellows was proved to be not lawlessness but loyalty, for when\r\nresistance was of no avail, they “speedily[219] recovered their\r\nworking order, and gave but little trouble to the Visitors,” a contrast\r\nto the general example of other Colleges.\r\n\r\nThe more eminent Brasenose men who belong to this period are: Alexander\r\nNowell, Fellow and Principal, Dean of St. Paul’s (matr. 1521); John\r\nFoxe, the Martyrologist (_c._ 1533); Sampson Erdeswick, the historian\r\nof Staffordshire (1553); Thomas Egerton, afterwards Lord Chancellor\r\nEllesmere (_c._ 1556); Sir Henry Savile, afterwards Warden of Merton\r\n(1561); John Guillim, the herald (_c._ 1585); Robert Burton, the author\r\nof the _Anatomy of Melancholy_ (1593); Sir John Spelman, the antiquary\r\n(1642); Elias Ashmole, the herald, founder of the Ashmolean Museum\r\n(1644); and Sir William Petty (1649).\r\n\r\n\r\nV. BRASENOSE IN MODERN TIMES.\r\n\r\nThe period from the Restoration to 1800 was in Oxford as elsewhere\r\nmarked rather by the excellence of individuals than by a high standard\r\nof general culture. In the first part of the period Brasenose is not\r\nespecially distinguished, except by an undue prominence in the records\r\nof the Vice-Chancellor’s Court; but as we approach the close of the\r\neighteenth century there are signs of a period of great prosperity,\r\nwhich distinguished the headships of Cleaver, Hodson and Gilbert, the\r\nfirst and last of whom were Bishops of Chester (then of Bangor, and\r\nfinally of St. Asaph) and Chichester respectively. The signs of this\r\nare unmistakable. The numbers show an unusual increase, and the College\r\nis in the front both in the class-lists and in outdoor sports. The\r\nhigh-water mark was perhaps reached when the story could be told of Dr.\r\nHodson (in about 1808), which is related in Mark Pattison’s _Memoirs_.\r\n“Returning to College, after one Long Vacation, Hodson drove the last\r\nstage into Oxford, with post-horses. The reason he gave for this piece\r\nof ostentation was, ‘That it should not be said that the first tutor\r\nof the first College of the first University of the world entered it\r\nwith a pair.’ … The story is symbolical of the high place B.N.C. held\r\nin the University at the time, in which however, intellectual eminence\r\nentered far less than the fact that it numbered among its members many\r\ngentlemen commoners of wealthy and noble families.”\r\n\r\nBut intellectual eminence there certainly was at this time, for in\r\nthe class-lists of Mich. 1808 to Mich. 1810, out of thirty-seven\r\nfirst-classes Brasenose claimed seven, monopolizing one list\r\naltogether; and out of seventy-five second-classes it held twelve.\r\nThis was the period of what has been called the “famous Brasenose\r\nbreakfast.” Reginald Heber won the Newdigate in 1803 with a poem which\r\nwill never be forgotten--his _Palestine_. His rooms were on Staircase\r\n6, one pair left, under the great chestnut in Exeter Garden called\r\nHeber’s Tree. In 1803 Sir Walter Scott went to Oxford with Richard\r\nHeber, Reginald’s brother. The story may be told in Lockhart’s[220]\r\nwords: Heber “had just been declared the successful competitor for\r\nthat year’s poetical prize, and read to Scott at breakfast in Brazen\r\nNose College the MS. of his _Palestine_. Scott observed that in the\r\nverses on Solomon’s Temple one striking circumstance had escaped him,\r\nnamely that no tools were used in its erection. Reginald retired for a\r\nfew minutes to the corner of the room, and returned with the beautiful\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n    ‘No hammer fell, no ponderous axes rung;\r\n    Like some tall palm the mystic fabric sprung,\r\n    Majestic silence!’”[221]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this literary and social side of the College may be\r\nmentioned the Phœnix Common-room or Club, the only social Club in the\r\nUniversity which is more than a century old. It was started in 1781\r\nor 1782 by Joseph Alderson, an undergraduate of Brasenose, afterwards\r\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and received a full constitution\r\nwith officers and rules in 1786. It has always nominally consisted of\r\ntwelve members, generally dining together once a week. The records\r\nof the Club are singularly complete, even to the caricatures on the\r\nblotting-paper of the dinner-books. Of the twelve original members five\r\nwere soon elected to Fellowships, and such names as Frodsham Hodson\r\n(afterwards Principal), Viscount Valentia (_d._ 1844), Earl Fortescue\r\n(_d._ 1861), Reginald Heber (Bishop of Calcutta), Lord George\r\nGrenville (_d._ 1850), the Earl of Delawarr, the friend of Byron,\r\nRichard Harington (afterwards Principal), Lord Sidney Godolphin Osborne\r\n(“S. G. O.”), and the present Deans of Rochester and Worcester, have\r\nraised it to no ordinary level. Its contemporary from 1828 to 1834, the\r\nHell-fire Club, was of a very different character; but from one or two\r\ndubious incidents in its career has found its way into literature.[222]\r\nThe incident which produced from the pen of Reginald Heber the humorous\r\npoem entitled the _Whippiad_[223] was connected with members of the\r\nPhœnix, though not with a meeting of the Club. The Senior Tutor had\r\nincautiously endeavoured to wrest a whip from Bernard Port, who had\r\nbeen loudly cracking it in the quadrangle; but alas, the representative\r\nof constitutional authority soon measured his length on the grass,\r\nbeing, not for the first time (as Heber maliciously notes) “floored by\r\nPort.”\r\n\r\nThe Ale Verses were an ancient social custom, probably at least as\r\nold as the Restoration. On Shrove Tuesday the butler presented a copy\r\nof English verses on Brasenose Ale to the Principal, written by some\r\nundergraduate, and received thereupon a certain sum of money. The\r\nearliest extant poem is of about the year 1700; but there is a long\r\ngap from that year till 1806, and they are not continuously preserved\r\ntill from 1826, having been printed first in about 1811. They supply\r\nall kinds of contemporary information, collegiate, academical and\r\npolitical, chiefly of course by way of allusion. At last in 1886 the\r\nCollege Brew-house was removed to make room for new buildings, and with\r\nit went the Ale Verses, except that in 1889 one more set was issued.\r\nIn 1888 a Fellow of the College printed a Latin dirge over the sad\r\nsurcease; but soon the Verses will be forgotten, and the Brew-house.\r\n\r\nOn the river Brasenose has always been prominent: never once in the\r\nEights or Torpids has it sunk below the ninth place. In the first\r\ninter-collegiate races, in 1815, Brasenose is at the head, and when the\r\nrecords begin again, in 1822, again takes the lead. At the present time\r\n(June 1891) B.N.C. has started head in the Eights on 110 days.[224]\r\n\r\nThe only clubs which had cricket grounds of their own in about 1835\r\nwere the Brasenose and the Bullingdon (Ch. Ch.), and even in 1847 the\r\nMagdalen, _i. e._ the University Club, was the only additional one.\r\nEarly cricketing records are difficult to find; but in recent times no\r\nCollege has been able to show such a record as B.N.C. in 1871, when\r\nit had eight men in the University eleven, and when sixteen of the\r\nCollege beat an All-England eleven. In 1873 sixteen of B.N.C. also beat\r\nthe United North of England eleven. The Inter-University high-jump of\r\n1876, when M. J. Brooks of B.N.C. cleared 6 feet 2½ inches, was an\r\nextraordinary performance.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the College at all times have been remarkably\r\nsimilar and persistent, if the present writer can trust his judgment.\r\nThey may be described as, first and foremost, a marked but not\r\nexclusive predilection for the exercises and amusements of out-door\r\nlife, the result of sound bodies and minds, and in part, no doubt, of\r\na long connection with old county families of a high type. And next\r\na certain pertinacity, perseverance, power of endurance, doggedness,\r\npatriotism, solidarity, or by whatever other name the spirit may be\r\ncalled which leads men to do what they are doing with all their might,\r\nto undergo training and discipline for the sake of the College, and\r\nhang together like a cluster of bees in view of a common object.\r\nThe Headship of the River for any length of time cannot possibly be\r\nobtained by fitful effort, or the unsustained enthusiasm of a single\r\nleader; but rather (and herein consists its value) by a continuous,\r\noften unconsciously continuous, effort of several years, backed up\r\nby the general support of the College. Lastly, Brasenose seems to be\r\nsingularly central, intermediate, and in a good sense average and\r\nmediocre. Its position and buildings, its history, its achievements,\r\nthe roll of Brasenose authors, all give evidence that the College is\r\na good sample of the best sort of academical foundation. A writer\r\nwho might wish to select a single College for study as a specimen of\r\nthe kind, would find the history of Brasenose neither startling nor\r\ncommonplace, neither eccentric nor uninteresting, neither full of\r\nstrong contrasts nor deficient in the signs of healthy corporate life.\r\n\r\nAmong the _alumni_ of Brasenose in this period, to omit the names of\r\nliving persons, are the following: Thomas Carte the historian (1699);\r\nJohn Napleton (matr. 1755), an academical reformer; Dr. John Latham,\r\npresident of the College of Physicians (1778); Bishop Reginald Heber\r\n(1800); Richard Harris Barham, author of the _Ingoldsby Legends_, after\r\nwhom a College club is named the Ingoldsby (1807); Henry Hart Milman,\r\nDean of St. Paul’s (1810); and the Rev. Frederick William Robertson,\r\nof Brighton, the preacher (1837). Mr. Buckley has compiled a list of\r\nmore than four hundred Brasenose authors, and twenty-seven bishops or\r\narchbishops.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE BUILDINGS, PROPERTY, ETC., OF THE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nThe front quadrangle of the College is as it stood when the College was\r\nfirst built, except that as usual an extra story was added in about\r\nthe time of James I., and that for the old mullioned windows have\r\nbeen unhappily substituted in a few places modern square ones. The\r\nPrincipal’s lodgings were at first, as always in Colleges, above and\r\nabout the gateway.\r\n\r\nThe _Chapel_ was originally the room now used for the Common Room,\r\nnamely, on the first floor of No. 1 staircase, and the foundation stone\r\nwas no doubt placed there as leading to the chapel. The shape of the\r\nold chapel windows may still be seen on the outside of the south side\r\nof the room. The present chapel was built between 26th June, 1656,\r\nand the day of consecration (to St. Hugh and St. Chad) 17th Nov.,\r\n1666. There is a persistent tradition that the design of the chapel\r\nwas due to Sir Christopher Wren, and that the roof at least came from\r\nthe chapel of St. Mary’s College (now Frewen Hall). In support of\r\nthis latter belief are the two facts that the roof does not appear\r\nprecisely to fit the window spaces of the building, and that the\r\nprincipal rafters of the chapel and of the western part of the hall are\r\nnumbered consecutively, as if they once belonged to a single building.\r\nThe architecture of the chapel is interesting as a genuine effort to\r\ncombine classical and Gothic styles. The ceiling, with its beautiful\r\nand ingeniously constructed fan-tracery, and the windows are Gothic,\r\nbut the internal buttresses and altar decoration are Grecian. The East\r\nwindow[225] is by Hardman (1855), the West (by Pearson) was given by\r\nPrincipal Cawley in 1776. Among the other painted glass is one on the\r\nnorth side to F. W. Robertson. The brass eagle was given in 1731 by T.\r\nL. Dummer; the two candelabra were replaced within the last few years,\r\nhaving been formerly presented to Coleshill Church, in Buckinghamshire,\r\nby the College. The pair of pre-Reformation chalices with pattens form\r\na unique possession.\r\n\r\nThe first _Library_ was the room now known as No. 4 one pair right,\r\nand still retains a fine panelled ceiling with red and gold colouring.\r\nThe present library is of the same date as the chapel, having been\r\nfinished in 1663, and is no doubt by the same architect. The internal\r\nfittings date from 1780, and not till then were the chains removed from\r\nthe books. Among the few MSS. are a tenth century Terence (once in\r\nthe possession of Cardinal Bembo, and therefore periodically raising\r\nunfulfilled hopes in foreign students that it might exhibit the unique\r\nrecension of the other “Bembine Terence”) and the only MS. of Bishop\r\nPearson’s minor works. A large folio printed Missal of 1520 bears a\r\nminiature of Sir Richard Sutton, with other fine illuminations. Among\r\nthe printed books are several given by the founder, Bishop Smith, and\r\nby John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln. There is a copy on vellum of\r\nAlexander de Ales’s commentary on the _De Animâ_ of Aristotle, printed\r\nat Oxford in 1481; a copy of Cranmer’s Litany (1544), and of Day’s\r\nPsalter (1563) for four-part singing. In general the library has a\r\nlarge number of controversial theological pieces and pamphlets, both\r\nof the latter part of Elizabeth’s reign and of the period succeeding\r\nthe Restoration. For the former the College is indebted to a large and\r\n(at the time) extremely valuable donation from Dr. Henry Mason, who\r\ndied in 1647. There is also a very large quantity of the theological\r\nliterature of the eighteenth century, partly bequeathed by Principal\r\nYarborough, who also presented the library of Christopher Wasse; many\r\ncounty histories; and many pamphlets on Oxford Reform up to and\r\nincluding the time of the first Commission. In all there are about\r\n15,000 volumes, and there is an adequate endowment from the legacy of\r\nDr. Grimbaldson. Mr. Willis Clark has remarked in his _Architectural\r\nHistory of Cambridge_ that College libraries before the sixteenth\r\ncentury usually, in both Universities, had their sides facing east and\r\nwest, the early morning light being so important; that from that time\r\nto the Restoration, when more luxurious habits had come in, they face\r\nnorth and south, and afterwards again east and west. It is singular\r\nthat of each change Brasenose Library is the earliest example.\r\n\r\nThe _Hall_ has remained almost untouched from the first. The open\r\nfireplace in the centre under a louvre was retained until 1760 (when\r\nthe Hon. Ashton Curzon gave the present chimney-piece), and the louvre\r\nitself is still intact but hidden above the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe north-west corner of the quadrangle affords a striking view of\r\nthe dome of the Radcliffe and the spire of St. Mary’s, which has been\r\noften painted and engraved. The present grass-plot was once a formal\r\nmaze or Italian garden, which is to be seen in Loggan’s view, and was\r\nremoved in October 1727, much to Hearne’s disgust, to allow of a “silly\r\nstatue” of Cain and Abel, the gift of Dr. George Clarke, who bought\r\nit in London, being erected in the centre. This well-known statue was\r\nfor a long time believed to be an original by Giovanni da Bologna; and\r\nits removal in 1881 and subsequent destruction excited the wrath of\r\nthe writer of the article on “Sculpture” in the ninth edition of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_. But the external evidence points to it being\r\nonly a copy of the valuable original presented to Charles I. at Madrid,\r\nand by George III. to the great-grandfather of the present possessor,\r\nSir William Worsley, of Hovingham Hall, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe _Kitchen_, which forms the western part of the second quadrangle is\r\n(as at Christ Church) as old as any part of the College. The eastern\r\nside was till about 1840 an open cloister beneath the library, and in\r\nit and in front of it many former members of the College were buried.\r\n\r\nEarly in the last century the College purchased the houses between\r\nSt. Mary’s and All Saints, and the idea of a front to the High Street\r\nsoon forced itself on the mind. Some very heavy classical designs are\r\npreserved, by Nicholas Hawksmoor (about 1720), who erected the High\r\nStreet front of Queen’s College; by Sir John Soane (1807); and by\r\nPhilip Hardwick (1810); until at last a pure Gothic design by Mr. T.\r\nG. Jackson was accepted; and by the end of 1887 a gateway and tower,\r\na Principal’s house, and some undergraduates’ rooms were erected,\r\nforming on the inside a large third quadrangle, and by its front a\r\nnotable addition to the glories of the High Street. A drawing of a\r\nmore ambitious design by the same architect is framed and hung in the\r\nCollege library.\r\n\r\nThe chief benefactors and property of the College are the\r\nfollowing--Bp. William Smith, founder, gave Basset’s Fee near Oxford,\r\nand the entire property of the suppressed Priory of Cold Norton, lying\r\nchiefly in Oxfordshire. Sir Richard Sutton gave lands in Burgh or\r\nErdborowe in Leicestershire; the White Hart in the Strand, London;\r\nand lands in Cropredy, North Ockington, Garsington, and Cowley. The\r\nearliest gift of all was from Mrs. Elizabeth Morley, who in 1515 gave\r\nthe manor of Pinchpoll, in Faringdon, coupled with conditions of\r\nundertaking certain services in St. Margaret’s, Westminster. Joyce\r\nFrankland in 1586 gave the Red Lion in Kensington, &c., and money.\r\nQueen Elizabeth, 1572 and 1579, founds Middleton School in Lancashire,\r\nand connects it with the College by scholarships, and by giving the\r\nmanor of Upberry and rectory of Gillingham. Sarah Duchess of Somerset\r\nin 1679 gave Somerset Iver and Somerset Thornhill scholarships, and\r\nalternate presentation to Wootton Rivers. William Hulme, 1691, land\r\nproducing £40 a year for four exhibitions, tenable at Brasenose, from\r\nLancashire; the property increased enormously in value, being in the\r\nHulme district of Manchester, and now provides, besides High Schools\r\nfor boys and girls at Manchester, and a Hulme Hall connected with the\r\nVictoria University, eight Senior and twelve Junior Exhibitions, of the\r\nvalue of £120 and £80 respectively. Sir Francis Bridgeman in 1701 gave\r\nmoney for an annual speech, originally in praise of James II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pictures, busts, &c._\r\n\r\nIn the Hall are pictures of King Alfred[226] (modern), Bp. William\r\nSmith (founder), Sir Richard Sutton (founder), Joyce Frankland\r\n(benefactress, with a sixteenth century watch in her hand), Alexander\r\nNowell (Principal), Bp. Frodsham Hodson (Principal), William Cleaver\r\n(Principal), Thomas baron Ellesmere, Dr. John Latham, John Lord\r\nMordaunt (benefactor), Samuel Radcliffe (Principal, two), Sarah Duchess\r\nof Somerset (benefactress), Robert Burton, Thomas Yate (Principal),\r\nFrancis Yarborough (Principal), Bp. Ashurst Turner Gilbert (Principal),\r\nEdward Hartopp Cradock (Principal). The Brazen Nose is fixed in a frame\r\nbeneath the picture of King Alfred. A picture of the first Marquis of\r\nBuckingham once here is now in the possession of the representatives of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nIn the north window at the east end of the Hall are portraits of the\r\ntwo founders, and a face with a grotesque nose, in painted glass. The\r\nglass of the south window is modern.\r\n\r\nIn the _Library_ are busts of Lord Grenville by Nollekens, and of Pitt.\r\n\r\nIn the _Bursary_ is a second picture of Joyce Frankland.\r\n\r\nIn the _Chapel_ are an old copy of Spagnoletto’s Entombment of Christ,\r\na copy of Poussin’s Assumption of St. Paul, and busts of the two\r\nfounders, formerly in niches in the middle of the north side of the\r\nHall outside and engraved in Spelman’s _Ælfredi Magni Vita_ (Oxon.\r\n1678).\r\n\r\nOn the gateway outside is a metal gilt Nose of a grotesque type,\r\nprobably derived from the painted glass in the hall.\r\n\r\nOn the entrance to the hall are two worn busts of Johannes Scotus\r\nErigena and King Alfred.\r\n\r\nIn the _Buttery_ are pictures of the Child of Hale (John Middleton,\r\n_d._ 1623, a Lancashire man distinguished for size and strength, after\r\nwhom the Brasenose boat is always named), of Joyce Frankland, and of\r\nthe Brasenose Boat in about 1825.\r\n\r\nIn the Principal’s lodgings are pictures of Lord Mordaunt, Bp. Cleaver,\r\nand Joyce Frankland.\r\n\r\nThe _title_ of the College is “the King’s Hall and College of\r\nBrasenose in Oxford” (Aula Regia et Collegium de Brasenose in Oxonia),\r\nthe spelling of the chief word being in chronological sequence,\r\nomitting minor variations, Brasinnose, Brazen Nose (eighteenth\r\ncentury), Brasenose; but the latest spelling is also found early in\r\nthe seventeenth century, probably showing that it was at all times\r\npronounced as a disyllable. The phrases _King’s College_ and _Collegium\r\nRegale_ are also found at an early date, the latter occurring on the\r\nCollege seal, which consists of three Gothic niches or compartments,\r\nwith St. Hugh and St. Chad on either side and the Trinity in the\r\ncentre: underneath is a small shield with Smyth’s arms, and round is\r\nthe legend, “Sigillum commune colegii regalis de brasinnose in oxonia.”\r\n\r\nThe _Arms_ of the College are: The escutcheon divided into three\r\nparts paleways, the centre or, thereon an escutcheon charged with the\r\narms of the See of _Lincoln_ (gules, two lions passant gardant in pale\r\nor, on a chief azure Our Lady crowned, sitting on a tombstone issuant\r\nfrom the chief, in her dexter arm the Infant Jesus, in her sinister a\r\nsceptre, all or), ensigned with a mitre, all proper: the dexter side\r\nargent, a chevron sable between three roses gules seeded or barbed\r\nvert, being the arms of the founder William _Smyth_: on the sinister\r\nside the arms of Sir Richard _Sutton_ of Prestbury, knight, viz.\r\nquarterly first and fourth, argent a chevron between three bugle-horns\r\nstringed sable, for _Sutton_, second and third, argent a chevron\r\nbetween three crosses crosslet sable, for _Southworth_.\r\n\r\nA coat of arms tripartite paleways is a very rare phenomenon, but\r\nis found among Oxford Colleges at Lincoln and Corpus. The cause at\r\nBrasenose was no doubt an attempt to combine symmetrically on one\r\nshield the arms of the founders, the see of Lincoln being given a\r\ndisproportionate amount and a central position, from the honour brought\r\nby connection with it as both the Founder’s and the Visitor’s see. For\r\nthe sake of appearance also the arms of Lincoln are placed within the\r\nfield, the mitre with which they are ensigned being included in the\r\npale. The only variations are that (1) in some old examples the arms\r\nof Lincoln cover the whole central pale, the entire College arms being\r\nensigned with a mitre or stringed, and sometimes with a crosier and\r\nkey in saltire; (2) the crosses crosslet are found as crosses crosslet\r\nfitchy or crosses patoncé. The nearest approach to an early official\r\ndeclaration of the arms is to be found in Richard Lee’s report from the\r\nbest evidence he could obtain, made at the same time as his Visitation\r\nin 1574, and to be found in MS. H 6 of the College of Arms.\r\n\r\nThe College seems never to have had a motto, but Bishop William Smyth’s\r\n(“Dominus exaltatio mea”) has been occasionally and unofficially used,\r\nas in the new Principal’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.

FOWLER, D.D., F.S.A., PRESIDENT OF CORPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis College was founded by Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester and\r\nLord Privy Seal to Kings Henry VII. and VIII., in the year 1516. For\r\nthe life of Foxe, which is full of interest, and thoroughly typical\r\nof the career of a statesman-ecclesiastic of those times, I must\r\nrefer the reader to my article on Richard Foxe in the _Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography_.[227] Foxe had, in early life, linked his fortunes\r\nwith those of Henry VII., then Earl of Richmond, while in exile in\r\nFrance; and, after the battle of Bosworth Field (22nd August, 1485),\r\nhe became, in rapid succession, Principal Secretary of State, Lord\r\nPrivy Seal, and Bishop of Exeter. He was subsequently translated to\r\nBath and Wells (1491-2), Durham (1494), and Winchester (1501), then the\r\nwealthiest See in England. The principal event in his life (at least\r\nin its far-reaching consequences) was his negotiation, while Bishop of\r\nDurham, of the marriage between James IV. of Scotland and the Princess\r\nMargaret, eldest daughter of Henry VII., which resulted, a century\r\nlater, in the permanent union of the English and Scottish crowns under\r\nJames VI.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Foxe, who, as we learn from his woodwork in the\r\nbanqueting-hall of Durham Castle, had, so early as 1499, adopted, as\r\nhis device, the pelican feeding her young, was early inspired with\r\nthe idea of founding some important educational institution for the\r\nbenefit of the Church. This idea, shortly before the foundation of\r\nhis present College, had taken the shape of a house in Oxford for\r\nthe reception of young monks from St. Swithin’s Priory in Winchester\r\nwhile attending academical lectures and disputations in Oxford.\r\nThere were other such houses in Oxford, such as Canterbury College,\r\nDurham College,[228] and the picturesque staircases, connected with\r\nvarious Benedictine monasteries, still standing in Worcester College.\r\nBut his friend, Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, more prescient than\r\nhimself, already foresaw the fall of the monasteries and, with them,\r\nof their academical dependencies in Oxford. “What, my Lord,” Oldham is\r\nrepresented as saying by John Hooker, _alias_ Vowell (see _Holinshed’s\r\nChronicles_), “shall we build houses and provide livelihoods for a\r\ncompany of bussing[229] monks, whose end and fall we ourselves may live\r\nto see; no, no, it is more meet a great deal that we should have care\r\nto provide for the increase of learning, and for such as who by their\r\nlearning shall do good in the Church and commonwealth.” Thus Foxe’s\r\nbenefaction (to which Oldham himself liberally contributed, as did also\r\nthe founder’s steward, William Frost, and other of his friends) took\r\nthe more common form of a College for the education of the secular\r\nclergy. A site was purchased between Merton and St. Frideswide’s (the\r\nmonastery subsequently converted into, first, Cardinal College, and\r\nthen Christ Church), the land being acquired mainly from Merton and\r\nSt. Frideswide’s, though a small portion was also bought from the nuns\r\nof Godstow. It has been suggested that the sale by Merton (comprising\r\nabout two-thirds of the site on which Corpus now stands) was a forced\r\none, a supposition which derives some plausibility from the fact that\r\nthe alienation effectually prevented the extension of the ante-chapel\r\nof Merton College as well as from Foxe’s powerful position at Court.\r\nBut against this theory we may place the fact that the then Warden of\r\nMerton (Richard Rawlyns), when subsequently accused, amongst other\r\ncharges, before the Visitor, of having alienated part of the homestead\r\nof the College, does not appear to have pleaded, in extenuation, any\r\nexternal pressure from high quarters.\r\n\r\nFoxe induced his friend John Claymond, who, like himself, was a\r\nLincolnshire man, to transfer himself from the Presidentship of\r\nMagdalen to that of the newly-founded College, the difference in\r\nincome being made up by his presentation to the valuable Rectory of\r\nCleeve in Gloucestershire. Robert Morwent, another Magdalen man, was\r\nmade perpetual Vice-President, to which exceptional privilege was\r\nsubsequently (1527-8) added that of the right of succession to the\r\nPresidency. Several of the original Fellows and scholars were also\r\nbrought from Magdalen, so that Corpus was, in a certain sense, a\r\ncolony from what has usually been supposed, and on strong grounds of\r\nprobability, to have been Foxe’s own College.\r\n\r\nThe statutes were given by the founder in the year 1517, and\r\nsupplemented in 1527, the revised version being signed by him, in an\r\nextremely trembling hand, on the 13th of February, 1527-8, within\r\neight months of his death, which occurred on the 5th of October, 1528,\r\nprobably at his Castle of Wolvesey in Winchester. These statutes are\r\nof peculiar interest, both on account of the vivid picture which they\r\nbring before us of the domestic life of a mediæval college, and the\r\nprovision made for instruction in the new learning introduced by the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nThe greatest novelty of the Corpus statutes is the institution of a\r\npublic lecturer in Greek, who was to lecture to the entire University,\r\nand was evidently designed to be one of the principal officers of the\r\nCollege. This readership appears to have been the first permanent\r\noffice created in either University for the purpose of giving\r\ninstruction in the Greek language; though, for some years before the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century, Grocyn, Linacre, and others, had taught\r\nGreek at Oxford, in a private or semi-official capacity. On Mondays,\r\nWednesdays, and Fridays, throughout the year, the Greek reader was\r\nto give instruction in some portion of the Grammar of Theodorus or\r\nother approved Greek grammarian, together with some part of Lucian,\r\nPhilostratus, or the orations of Isocrates. On Tuesdays, Thursdays,\r\nand Saturdays, throughout the year, he was to lecture in Aristophanes,\r\nTheocritus, Euripides, Sophocles, Pindar, or Hesiod, or some other\r\nof the more ancient Greek poets, with some part of Demosthenes,\r\nThucydides, Aristotle, Theophrastus, or Plutarch. It will be noticed\r\nthat there is no express mention in this list of Homer, Aeschylus,\r\nHerodotus, or Plato. Thrice a week, moreover, in vacations, he was to\r\ngive private instruction in Greek grammar or rhetoric, or some Greek\r\nauthor, to all members of the College below the degree of Master of\r\nArts. Lastly, all Fellows and scholars below the degree of Bachelor in\r\nDivinity, including even Masters of Arts, were bound, on pain of loss\r\nof commons, to attend the public lectures of both the Greek and Latin\r\nreader; and not only so, but to pass a satisfactory examination in them\r\nto be conducted three evenings in the week.\r\n\r\nSimilar regulations as to teaching are laid down with regard to the\r\nProfessor of Humanity or Latin, whose special province it is carefully\r\nto extirpate all “barbarism” from our “bee-hive,” the name by which,\r\nthroughout these statutes, Foxe fondly calls his College.[230] The\r\nlectures were to begin at eight in the morning, and to be given all\r\nthrough the year, either in the Hall of the College, or in some\r\npublic place within the University. The authors specified are Cicero,\r\nSallust, Valerius Maximus, Suetonius, Pliny’s _Natural History_, Livy,\r\nQuintilian, Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, Juvenal, Terence, and Plautus. It\r\nwill be noticed that Horace and Tacitus are absent from the list.[231]\r\nMoreover, in vacations, the Professor is to lecture, three times a\r\nweek, to all inmates of the College below the degree of Master of Arts,\r\non the _Elegantiae_ of Laurentius Valla, the _Attic Nights_ of Aulus\r\nGellius, the _Miscellanea_ of Politian, or something of the like kind\r\naccording to the discretion of the President and Seniors.\r\n\r\nThe third reader was to be a Lecturer in Theology, “the science\r\nwhich we have always so highly esteemed, that this our bee-hive has\r\nbeen constructed solely or mainly for its sake.” But, even here, the\r\nspirit of the Renaissance is predominant. The Professor is to lecture\r\nevery working-day throughout the year (excepting ten weeks), year\r\nby year in turn, on some portion of the Old or New Testament. The\r\nauthorities for their interpretation, however, are no longer to be such\r\nmediæval authors as Nicolas de Lyra or Hugh of Vienne (more commonly\r\ncalled Hugo de Sancto Charo or Hugh of St. Cher), far posterior in\r\ntime and inferior in learning,[232] but the holy and ancient Greek\r\nand Latin doctors, especially Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, Origen,\r\nHilary, Chrysostom, John of Damascus, and others of that kind. These\r\ntheological lectures were to be attended by all Fellows of the College\r\nwho had been assigned to the study of theology, except Doctors. No\r\nspecial provision seems to be made in the statutes for the theological\r\ninstruction of the junior members of the College, such as the scholars,\r\nclerks, etc.; but the services in chapel would furnish a constant\r\nreminder of the principal events in Christian history and the essential\r\ndoctrines of the Christian Church. The Doctors, though exempt from\r\nattendance at lectures, were, like all the other “theologians,” bound\r\nto take part in the weekly theological disputations. Absence, in\r\ntheir case as in that of the others, was punishable by deprivation of\r\ncommons, and, if persisted in, it is curious to find that the ultimate\r\npenalty was an injunction to preach a sermon, during the next Lent, at\r\nSt. Peter’s in the East.\r\n\r\nIn addition to attendance at the theological lectures of the public\r\nreader of their own College, “theologians,” not being Doctors, were\r\nrequired to attend two other lectures daily: one, beginning at seven\r\nin the morning, in the School of Divinity; the other, at Magdalen, at\r\nnine. Bachelors of Arts, so far as was consistent with attendance at\r\nthe public lectures in their own College, were to attend two lectures a\r\nday “in philosophy” (meaning probably, metaphysics, morals, and natural\r\nphilosophy), at Magdalen, going and returning in a body; one of these\r\ncourses of lectures, it may be noticed, appears from the Magdalen\r\nstatutes to have been delivered at six in the morning. Undergraduates\r\n(described as “sophistae et logici”) were to be lectured in logic, and\r\nassiduously practised in arguments and the solution of sophisms by one\r\nor two of the Fellows or probationers assigned for that purpose. These\r\nlecturers in logic were diligently to explain Porphyry and Aristotle,\r\nat first in Latin, afterwards in Greek. Moreover, all undergraduates,\r\nwho had devoted at least six months and not more than thirty to the\r\nstudy of logic, were to frequent the argumentative contest in the\r\nschools (“illud gloriosum in Parviso certamen”), as often as it\r\nseemed good to the President. Even on festivals and during holiday\r\ntimes, they were not to be idle, but to compose verses and letters on\r\nliterary subjects, to be shown up to the Professor of Humanity. They\r\nwere, however, to be permitted occasional recreation in the afternoon\r\nhours, both on festival and work days, provided they had the consent\r\nof the Lecturer and Dean, and the President (or, in his absence, the\r\nVice-President) raised no objection. Equal care was taken to prevent\r\nthe Bachelors from falling into slothful habits during the vacations.\r\nThree times a week at least, during the Long Vacation, they were,\r\neach of them, to expound some astronomical or mathematical work to be\r\nassigned, from time to time, by the Dean of Philosophy, in the hall\r\nor chapel, and all Fellows and probationers of the College, not being\r\ngraduates in theology, were bound to be present at the exercises. In\r\nthe shorter vacations, one of them, selected by the Dean of Arts as\r\noften as he chose to enjoin the task, was to explain some poet, orator,\r\nor historian, to his fellow-bachelors and undergraduates.\r\n\r\nNor was attendance at the University and College lectures, together\r\nwith the private instruction, examinations, and exercises connected\r\nwith them, the only occupation of these hard-worked students. They\r\nwere also bound, according to their various standings and faculties,\r\nto take part in or be present at frequent disputations in logic,\r\nnatural philosophy, metaphysics, morals, and theology. The theological\r\ndisputations, with the penalties attached to failure to take part\r\nin them, have already been noticed. The Bachelors of Arts, and, in\r\ncertain cases, the “necessary regents” among the Masters (that is,\r\nthose Masters of Arts who had not yet completed two years from the date\r\nof that degree), were also bound to dispute in the subjects of their\r\nfaculty, namely, logic, natural philosophy, metaphysics, and morals,\r\nfor at least two hours twice a week. Nor could any Fellow or scholar\r\ntake his Bachelor’s degree, till he had read and explained some work\r\nor portion of a work of some Latin poet, orator, or historian; or his\r\nMaster’s degree, till he had explained some book, or at least volume,\r\nof Greek logic or philosophy. When we add to these requirements of\r\nthe College the disputations also imposed by the University, and the\r\nnumerous religious offices in the chapel, we may easily perceive that,\r\nin this busy hive of literary industry, there was little leisure for\r\nthe amusements which now absorb so large a portion of the student’s\r\ntime and thoughts. Though, when absent from the University, they were\r\nnot forbidden to spend a moderate amount of time in hunting or fowling,\r\nyet, when actually in Oxford, they were restricted to games of ball in\r\nthe College garden. Nor had they, like the modern student, prolonged\r\nvacations. Vacation to them was mainly a respite from University\r\nexercises; the College work, though varied in subject-matter, going on,\r\nin point of quantity, much as usual. They were allowed indeed, for a\r\nreasonable cause, to spend a portion of the vacation away from Oxford,\r\nbut the whole time of absence, in the case of a Fellow, was not, in\r\nthe aggregate, to exceed forty days in the year, nor in the case of a\r\nprobationer or scholar, twenty days; nor were more than six members of\r\nthe foundation ever to be absent at a time, except at certain periods,\r\nwhich we might call the depths of the vacations, when the number might\r\nreach ten. The liberal ideas of the founder are, however, shown in the\r\nprovision that one Fellow or scholar at a time might have leave of\r\nabsence for three years, in order to settle in Italy, or some other\r\ncountry, for the purposes of study. He was to retain his full allowance\r\nduring absence, and, when he returned, he was to be available for the\r\noffice of a Reader, when next vacant.\r\n\r\nThis society of students would consist of between fifty and sixty\r\npersons, all of whom, we must recollect, were normally bound to\r\nresidence, and to take their part, each in his several degree, in the\r\nliterary activity of the College, or, according to the language of the\r\nfounder, “to make honey.” Besides the President, there were twenty\r\nFellows, twenty scholars (called “disciples”), two chaplains, and two\r\nclerks, who might be called the constant elements of the College.\r\nIn addition to these, there might be some or even all of the three\r\nReaders, in case they were not included among the Fellows; four, or\r\nat the most six, sons of nobles or lawyers (_juris-consulti_), a kind\r\nof boarder afterwards called “gentlemen-commoners”; and some even\r\nof the servants. The last class consisted of two servants for the\r\nPresident (one a groom, the other a body-servant), the manciple, the\r\nbutler, two cooks, the porter (who was also barber), and the clerk\r\nof accompt. It would appear from the statutes that these servants,\r\nor rather servitors, might or might not[233] pursue the studies of\r\nthe College, according to their discretion; if they chose to do so,\r\nthey probably proceeded to their degrees.[234] Lastly, there were two\r\ninmates of the College, who were too young to attend the lectures and\r\ndisputations, but who were to be taught grammar and instructed in good\r\nauthors, either within the College or at Magdalen School. These were\r\nthe choristers, who were to dine and sup with the servants, and to\r\nminister in the hall and chapel; but, as they grew older, were to have\r\na preference in the election to scholarships.\r\n\r\nPassing to the domestic arrangements, the Fellows and scholars--there\r\nare curiously no directions with regard to the other members of the\r\nCollege--were to sleep two and two in a room, a Fellow and scholar\r\ntogether, the Fellow in a high bed, and the scholar in a truckle-bed.\r\nThe Fellow was to have the supervision of the scholar who shared his\r\nroom, to set him a good example, to instruct him, to admonish or\r\npunish him if he did wrong, and (if need were) to report him to the\r\ndisciplinal officers of the College. The limitation of two to a room\r\nwas a distinct advance on the existing practice. At the most recently\r\nfounded Colleges, Magdalen and Brasenose, the number prescribed in the\r\nstatutes was three or four. As no provision is made in the statutes for\r\nbed-makers, or attendants on the rooms, there can be little doubt that\r\nthe beds were made and the rooms kept in order by the junior occupant,\r\nan office which, in those days when the sons of men of quality served\r\nas pages in great houses, implied no degradation.\r\n\r\nIn the hall there were two meals in the day, dinner and supper, the\r\nformer probably about eleven a.m. or noon, the latter probably about\r\nfive or six p.m. At what we should now call the High Table, there were\r\nto sit the President, Vice-President, and Reader in Theology, together\r\nwith the Doctors and Bachelors in that faculty; but even amongst them\r\nthere was a distinction, as there was an extra allowance for the dish\r\nof which the three persons highest in dignity partook, providing one of\r\nthe above three officers were present. The Vice-President and Reader in\r\nTheology, one or both of them, might be displaced, at the President’s\r\ndiscretion, by distinguished strangers. At the upper side-table, on the\r\nright, were to sit the Masters of Arts and Readers in Greek and Latin,\r\nin no prescribed order; at that on the left, the remaining Fellows,\r\nthe probationers, and the chaplains. The scholars and the two clerks\r\nwere to occupy the remaining tables, except the table nearest the\r\nbuttery, which was to be occupied by the two bursars, the steward, and\r\nthe clerk of accompt, for the purpose, probably, of superintending the\r\nservice. The steward was one of the graduate-fellows appointed, from\r\nweek to week, to assist the bursars in the commissariat and internal\r\nexpenditure of the College. It was also his duty to superintend the\r\nwaiting at the upper tables, and, indeed, it would seem as if he\r\nhimself took part in it. The ordinary waiters at these tables were\r\nthe President’s and other College servants, the choristers, and,\r\nif necessary, the clerks; but the steward had also the power of\r\nsupplementing their service from amongst the scholars. At the scholars’\r\ntables, the waiters were to be taken from amongst the scholars and\r\nclerks themselves, two a week in turn. What has been said above with\r\nregard to the absence, at that time, of any idea of degradation in\r\nrendering services in the chambers would equally apply here. Such\r\nservices would then be no more regarded as degrading than is fagging\r\nin a public school now.[235] During dinner, a portion of the Bible\r\nwas to be read by one of the Fellows or Scholars under the degree of\r\nMaster of Arts; and, when dinner was finished, it was to be expounded\r\nby the President or by one of the Fellows (being a theologian) who was\r\nto be selected for the purpose by the President or Vice-President,\r\nunder pain of a month’s deprivation of commons, if he refused. While\r\nthe Bible was not being read, the students were to be allowed to\r\nconverse at dinner, but only in Greek or Latin, which languages were\r\nalso to be employed exclusively, except to those ignorant of them or\r\nfor the purposes of the College accounts, not only in the chapel and\r\nhall but in the chambers and all other places of the College. As soon\r\nas dinner or supper was over, at least after grace and the loving-cup,\r\nall the students, senior and junior, were to leave the hall. The same\r\nrule was to apply to the _bibesia_, or _biberia_, then customary in\r\nthe University; which were slight refections of bread and beer,[236]\r\nin addition to the two regular meals. Exception, however, was made in\r\nfavour of those festivals of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin, and the\r\nSaints, on which it was customary to keep up the hall fire. For, on\r\nthe latter occasions, after refection and potation, the Fellows and\r\nprobationers might remain in the hall to sing or employ themselves in\r\nany other innocent recreations such as became clerics, or to recite and\r\ndiscuss poems, histories, the marvels of the world, and other such like\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe services in the chapel, especially on Sundays and festivals, it\r\nneed hardly be said, were numerous, and the penalties for absence\r\nsevere. On non-festival days the first mass was at five in the morning,\r\nand all scholars of the College and bachelor Fellows were bound to be\r\npresent from the beginning to the end, under pain of heavy punishments\r\nfor absence, lateness, or inattention. There were other masses which\r\nwere not equally obligatory, but the inmates of the College were, of\r\ncourse, obliged to keep the canonical hours. They were also charged, in\r\nconscience, to say certain private prayers on getting up in the morning\r\nor going to bed at night; as well as, once during the day, to pray for\r\nthe founder and other his or their benefactors.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the lectures, disputations, examinations, and\r\nprivate instruction, as well as of the scanty amusements, as compared\r\nwith those of our own day, which were then permitted. Something,\r\nhowever, still remains to be said of the mode of life prescribed by\r\nthe founder, and of the punishments inflicted for breach of rules.\r\nWe have seen that, when the Bachelors of Arts attended the lectures\r\nat Magdalen, they were obliged to go and return in a body. Even on\r\nordinary occasions, the Fellows, scholars, chaplains and clerks were\r\nforbidden to go outside the College, unless it were to the schools, the\r\nlibrary, or some other College or hall, unaccompanied by some other\r\nmember of the College as a “witness of their honest conversation.”\r\nUndergraduates required, moreover, special leave from the Dean or\r\nReader of Logic, the only exemption in their case being the schools.\r\nIf they went into the country, for a walk or other relaxation, they\r\nmust go in a company of not less than three, keep together all the\r\ntime, and return together. The only weapons they were allowed to carry,\r\nexcept when away for their short vacations, were the bow and arrow.\r\nWhether within the University or away from it, they were strictly\r\nprohibited from wearing any but the clerical dress. Once a year, they\r\nwere all to be provided, at the expense of the College, with gowns\r\n(to be worn outside their other habits) of the same colour, though of\r\ndifferent sizes and prices according to their position in College. It\r\nmay be noticed that these gowns were to be provided for the _famuli_\r\nor servants no less than for the other members of the foundation; and\r\nthat, for this purpose, the servants are divided into two classes, one\r\ncorresponding with the chaplains and probationary Fellows, the other\r\nwith the scholars, clerks, and choristers.\r\n\r\nBesides being subjected to the supervision of the various officers of\r\nthe College, each scholar was to be assigned by the President to a\r\ntutor, namely, the same Fellow whose chamber he shared. The tutor was\r\nto have the general charge of him; expend, on his behalf, the pension\r\nwhich he received from the College, or any sums which came to him from\r\nother sources; watch his progress, and correct his defects. If he were\r\nneither a graduate nor above twenty years of age, he was to be punished\r\nwith stripes; otherwise, in some other manner. Corporal punishment\r\nmight also be inflicted, in the case of the juniors, for various\r\nother offences, such as absence from chapel, inattention at lectures,\r\nspeaking English instead of Latin or Greek; and it was probably,\r\nfor the ordinary faults of undergraduates, the most common form of\r\npunishment. Other punishments--short of expulsion, which was the last\r\nresort--were confinement to the library with the task of writing out\r\nor composing something in the way of an imposition; sitting alone\r\nin the middle of hall, while the rest were dining, at a meal of dry\r\nbread and beer, or even bread and water; and lastly, the punishment,\r\nso frequently mentioned in the statutes, deprivation of commons. This\r\npunishment operated practically as a pecuniary fine, the offender\r\nhaving to pay for his own commons instead of receiving them free from\r\nthe College. The payment had to be made to the bursars immediately,\r\nor, at latest, at the end of term. All members of the College, except\r\nthe President and probably the Vice-President, were subject to this\r\npenalty, though, in case of the seniors, it was simply a fine, whereas\r\nundergraduates and Bachelors of Arts were obliged to take their\r\ncommons either alone or with others similarly punished. The offenders,\r\nmoreover, were compelled to write their names in a register, stating\r\ntheir offence and the number of days for which they were “put out of\r\ncommons.” Such registers still exist; but, as the names are almost\r\nexclusively those of Bachelors and undergraduates, it is probable that\r\nthe seniors, by immediate payment or otherwise, escaped this more\r\nignominious part of the punishment. It will be noticed that rustication\r\nand gating, words so familiar to the undergraduates of the present\r\ngeneration, do not occur in this enumeration. Rustication, in those\r\ndays, when many of the students came from such distant homes and the\r\nexercises in College were so severe, would generally have been either\r\ntoo heavy or too light a penalty. Gating, in our sense, could hardly\r\nexist, as the undergraduates, at least, were not free to go outside the\r\nwalls, except for scholastic purposes, without special leave, and that\r\nwould, doubtless, have been refused in case of any recent misconduct.\r\nHere it may be noticed that the College gates were closed in the winter\r\nmonths at eight, and in the summer months at nine, the keys being taken\r\nto the President to prevent further ingress or egress.\r\n\r\nSuch were the studies, and such was the discipline, of an Oxford\r\nCollege at the beginning of the sixteenth century; nor is there any\r\nreason to suppose that, till the troubled times of the Reformation,\r\nthese stringent rules were not rigorously enforced. They admirably\r\nserved the purpose to which they were adapted, the education of a\r\nlearned clergy, trained to habits of study, regularity, and piety, apt\r\nat dialectical fence, and competent to press all the secular learning\r\nof the time into the service of the Church. Never since that time\r\nprobably have the Universities or the Colleges so completely secured\r\nthe objects at which they aimed. But first, the Reformation; then, the\r\nCivil Wars; then, the Restoration of Charles II.; then, the Revolution\r\nof 1688; and lastly, the silent changes gradually brought about by the\r\nincreasing age of the students, the increasing proportion of those\r\ndestined for secular pursuits, and the growth of luxurious habits in\r\nthe country at large, have left little surviving of this cunningly\r\ndevised system. The aims of modern times, and the materials with which\r\nwe have to deal, have necessarily become different; but we may well\r\nenvy the zeal for religion and learning which animated the ancient\r\nfounders, the skill with which they adapted their means to their end,\r\nand the system of instruction and discipline which converted a body\r\nof raw youths, gathered probably, to a large extent, from the College\r\nestates, into studious and accomplished ecclesiastics, combining the\r\nnew learning with the ancient traditions of the ecclesiastical life.\r\n\r\nThe first President and Fellows were settled in their buildings, and\r\nput in possession of the College and its appurtenances, by the Warden\r\nof New College and the President of Magdalen, acting on behalf of the\r\nFounder, on the 4th of March, 1516-17. There were as many witnesses\r\nas filled two tables in the hall; among them being Reginald Pole\r\n(afterwards Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury), then a B.A. of\r\nMagdalen, and subsequently (February 14th, 1523-4) admitted, by special\r\nappointment of the Founder, Fellow of Corpus. Of the first President\r\nand Vice-President, and the large proportion of Magdalen men in the\r\noriginal society, mention has already been made. The first Professor\r\nof Humanity was Ludovicus Vivès, the celebrated Spanish humanist,\r\nwho had previously been lecturing in the South of Italy; the first\r\nProfessor of Greek expressly mentioned in the Register (not definitely\r\nappointed, however, till Jan. 2nd, 1520-21), was Edward Wotton, then\r\na young Magdalen man, subsequently Physician to Henry VIII., and\r\nauthor of a once well-known book, _De Differentiis Animalium_.[237]\r\nThe Professorship of Theology does not seem to have been filled up\r\neither on the original constitution of the College or at any subsequent\r\ntime. It is possible that the functions of the Professor may have been\r\nperformed by the Vice-President, who was _ex officio_ Dean of Theology.\r\nIn the very first list of admissions, however, to the new society,\r\nwe find the names of Nicholas Crutcher (_i. e._ Kratzer) a Bavarian,\r\na native of Munich, who was probably introduced into the College for\r\nthe purpose of teaching Mathematics. He was astronomer to Henry VIII.;\r\nleft memorials of himself in Oxford, in the shape of dials, in St.\r\nMary’s churchyard and in Corpus Garden;[238] and still survives in the\r\nfine portraits of him by Holbein. The sagacity of Foxe is singularly\r\nexemplified by his free admission of foreigners to his Readerships.\r\nWhile the Fellowships and scholarships were confined to certain\r\ndioceses and counties, and the only regular access to a Fellowship was\r\nthrough a Scholarship, the Readers might be natives of any part of\r\nEngland, or of Greece or Italy beyond the Po. It would seem, however,\r\nas if even this specification of countries was rather by way of\r\nexemplification than restriction, as the two first appointments, made\r\nby the founder himself, were of a Spaniard and a Bavarian.\r\n\r\nErasmus, writing, shortly after the settlement of the society, to John\r\nClaymond, the first President, in 1519, speaks (_Epist._, lib. 4) of\r\nthe great interest which had been taken in Foxe’s foundation by Wolsey,\r\nCampeggio, and Henry VIII. himself, and predicts that the College will\r\nbe ranked “inter praecipua decora Britanniae,” and that its “trilinguis\r\nbibliotheca” will attract more scholars to Oxford than were formerly\r\nattracted to Rome. This language, though somewhat exaggerated, shows\r\nthe great expectations formed by the promoters of the new learning of\r\nthis new departure in academical institutions.\r\n\r\nOf the subsequent history of the College, the space at my command only\r\nallows me to afford very brief glimpses.\r\n\r\nIn 1539, John Jewel (subsequently the celebrated Bishop of Salisbury)\r\nwas elected from a Postmastership at Merton to a scholarship at Corpus.\r\nFrom the interesting life of Jewel by Laurence Humfrey (published in\r\n1573), we gather that at the time when Jewel entered it, and for some\r\nyears subsequently, Corpus was still the “bee-hive” which its founder\r\nhad designed it to be. His Merton tutors, we learn, were very anxious\r\nto place him at Corpus, not only for his pecuniary, but also for his\r\neducational, advancement. The lectures, disputations, exercises, and\r\nexaminations prescribed by the founder seem still to have been retained\r\nin their full vigour, though it is curious to find that the author with\r\nwhom young Jewel was most familiar was Horace, whose works, as we have\r\nseen, were strangely omitted from the list of Latin books recommended\r\nin the original statutes. But that the College shared in the general\r\ndecay of learning, which accompanied the religious troubles of Edward\r\nVI.’s reign, is apparent from two orations delivered by Jewel: one in\r\n1552, in commemoration of the founder; the other probably a little\r\nearlier, a sort of declamation against Rhetoric, in his capacity of\r\nPraelector of Latin. In the latter oration, he contrasts unfavourably\r\nthe present with the former state of the University, referring its\r\ndegeneracy, its diminished influence, and its waning numbers, to\r\nthe excessive cultivation of rhetoric, and especially of the works\r\nof Cicero, “who has extinguished the light and glory of the whole\r\nUniversity.” In the former, and apparently later, oration, he deals\r\nmore specifically with the College, and admonishes its members to wash\r\nout, by their industry and application to study, the stain on their\r\nonce fair name, to throw off their lethargy, to recover their ancient\r\ndignity, and to take for their watchword “Studeamus.”\r\n\r\nJewel’s words of warning and incentive to study would seem to have\r\nborne good fruit in the days of Elizabeth, though they were speedily\r\nfollowed by his flight, during the Marian persecution, first to\r\nBroadgates Hall (now Pembroke College), and subsequently to Germany and\r\nSwitzerland, never more to return to Oxford, except in the capacity of\r\na visitor. But, at the time of his death (1571), he was represented at\r\nhis old College by one who was to be a still greater ornament of the\r\nChurch of England even than himself. In the year 1567, in the fifteenth\r\nyear of his age, according to Izaac Walton’s account, Richard Hooker,\r\nthrough Jewel’s kindness and with some assistance from his uncle, John\r\nHooker of Exeter, was enabled to go up to Oxford, there to receive,\r\non the good bishop’s recommendation, a clerk’s place in the gift of\r\nthe President of Corpus.[239] It would be futile to extract, and\r\npresumptuous to recast, the graphic account of young Hooker’s College\r\nlife as delineated by his quaint and venerable biographer. From his\r\nclerkship he was elected to a scholarship, when nearly twenty years of\r\nage, and from that he passed in due course to a Fellowship, which he\r\nvacated on marriage and presentation to a living in 1584. Thus Hooker\r\nresided in Corpus about seventeen years, and must there have laid in\r\nthat varied and extensive stock of knowledge and formed that sound\r\njudgment and stately style which raised him to the highest rank, not\r\nonly amongst English divines, but amongst English writers. “From that\r\ngarden of piety, of pleasure, of peace, and a sweet conversation,”\r\nhe passed “into the thorny wilderness of a busy world, into those\r\ncorroding cares that attend a married priest and a country parsonage”;\r\nand, most bitter and least tolerable of all the elements in his lot,\r\ninto the exacting and uncongenial society of his termagant wife.\r\nCorpus, at that time, is described by Walton as “noted for an eminent\r\nlibrary, strict students, and remarkable scholars.” Indeed, a College\r\nwhich, within a period of sixty years, admitted and educated John\r\nJewel, John Reynolds, Richard Hooker, and Thomas Jackson, four of the\r\ngreatest divines and most distinguished writers who have ever adorned\r\nthe Church of England, might, especially in an age when theology\r\nwas the most absorbing interest of the day, vie, small as it was in\r\nnumbers, with the largest and most illustrious Colleges in either\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThere is another picture of college life at Corpus, during the reign\r\nof Elizabeth, less pleasing than that on which we have just been\r\ndwelling. It seems that during the reign of Edward VI. and the early\r\npart of Elizabeth’s reign, possibly even to a much later period,\r\nseveral members of the foundation were secretly inclined to the Roman\r\nCatholic religion, or, to speak with more precision of the earlier\r\ncases, had not yet embraced the doctrines of Protestantism. It was\r\nprobably with a view to accelerate the reception of the reformed\r\nfaith, that, on the vacancy of the Presidentship in 1567 or 1568,\r\nElizabeth was advised to recommend William Cole, a former Fellow of\r\nthe society, who had been a refugee in Switzerland, and had there\r\nsuffered considerable hardships, which do not seem to have improved\r\nhis temper. The Fellows, notwithstanding the royal recommendation,\r\nelected one Robert Harrison, who had been recently removed from the\r\nCollege by the Visitor on account of his Romanist proclivities, “not\r\nat all taking notice,” says Anthony Wood, “of the said Cole; being\r\nvery unwilling to have him, his wife and children, and his Zurichian\r\ndiscipline introduced among them.” The Queen annulled the election,\r\nbut the Fellows still would not yield. Hereupon the aid of the\r\nVisitor was invoked; but, when the Bishop of Winchester came down\r\nwith his retinue, he found the gate closed against him. “At length,\r\nafter he had made his way in, he repaired to the chapel,” where,\r\nafter expelling those Fellows who were recalcitrant, he obtained the\r\nconsent of the remainder. A Royal Commission was also sent down to the\r\nCollege the same year, which, “after a strict inquiry and examination\r\nof several persons, expelled some as Roman Catholics, curbed those\r\nthat were suspected to incline that way, and gave encouragement to\r\nthe Protestants. Mr. Cole,” Wood[240] proceeds, “who was the first\r\nmarried President that Corp. Chr. Coll. ever had, being settled in his\r\nplace, acted so foully by defrauding the College and bringing it into\r\ndebt, that divers complaints were put up against him to the Bishop of\r\nWinchester, Visitor of that College. At length the said Bishop, in one\r\nof his quinquennial visitations, took Mr. Cole to task, and, after long\r\ndiscourses on both sides, the Bishop plainly told him, ‘Well, well,\r\nMr. President, seeing it is so, you and the College must part without\r\nany more ado, and therefore see that you provide for yourself.’ Mr.\r\nCole therefore, being not able to say any more, fetcht a deep sigh and\r\nsaid, ‘What, my good Lord, must I then eat mice at Zurich again?’ At\r\nwhich words the Bishop, being much terrified, for they worked with him\r\nmore than all his former oratory had done, said no more, but bid him\r\nbe at rest and deal honestly with the College.” The sensible advice of\r\nthe Bishop, however, was not acted on; and, whether the fault lay with\r\nthe President or with the Fellows, or, as is most likely, with both,\r\nthe bickerings, dissensions, and mutual recriminations between the\r\nPresident, and, at least, one section of the Fellows, continued during\r\nthe whole of Cole’s presidency, which lasted thirty years. There are\r\nsome MS. letters in the British Museum, by one Simon Tripp, which give\r\na painful idea of the bitterness of the quarrel. And Mrs. Cole seems to\r\nhave added to the embroilment: “nimirum Paris cum nescio qua Italica\r\nHelena perdite omnia perturbavit” (Tripp’s letter to Jewel). In 1580\r\nthere appear to have been hopes of Cole’s resigning; but his Presidency\r\ndid not come to an end, nor peace return to the College, till 1598,\r\nwhen an arrangement, much to the advantage of the College, was made, by\r\nwhich Dr. John Reynolds, who had been recently appointed to the Deanery\r\nof Lincoln, resigned that office, on the understanding that Cole would\r\nbe appointed his successor, and that, on Cole’s resignation of the\r\nPresidency, he would himself be elected by the Fellows. Cole died two\r\nyears afterwards, and is buried in Lincoln cathedral. Reynolds, the\r\nmost learned and distinguished President the College ever had, famous\r\nfor his share in the translation of the Bible and in the Hampton Court\r\ncontroversy, rests in Corpus chapel.\r\n\r\nI will now shift the scene to the year 1648, the second year of the\r\nParliamentary Visitation. On the 22nd of May, in this year, two orders\r\nwere issued by the “Committee of Lords and Commons for the Reformation\r\nof the University of Oxford,” one depriving Dr. Robert Newlyn of the\r\nPresidentship of Corpus as “guilty of high contempt and denyall of\r\nauthority of parliament,” the other constituting Dr. Edmund Staunton\r\nPresident in his stead. On the 27th of May, we read, in Anthony\r\nWood’s _Annals_, that the Visitors (who sat in Oxford, and must be\r\ndistinguished from the Committee mentioned above, who sat in London)\r\n“caused a paper to be stuck on Corp. Ch. College gate to depose Dr.\r\nNewlin from being President, but the paper was soon after torn down\r\nwith indignation and scorn.” And again, on the 11th of July, they “went\r\nto C. C. Coll., dashed out Dr. Newlin’s name from the Buttery-book, and\r\nput in that of Dr. Stanton formerly voted into the place; but their\r\nbacks were no sooner turned but his name was blotted out with a pen by\r\nWill. Fulman and then torn out by Tim. Parker, scholars of that House.\r\nAt the same time (if I mistake not) they[241] brake open the Treasury,\r\nbut found nothing.” After this audacious feat we can hardly wonder that\r\nWill. Fulman and Tim. Parker were expelled by the Visitors on the 22nd\r\nof July. Fulman (the famous and industrious antiquary, many volumes\r\nof whose researches are still preserved in the Corpus library) was\r\nrestored in 1660. Corpus being one of the specially Royalist Colleges,\r\nit is not surprising to find that almost a clean sweep was made of\r\nthe existing foundation, including the five principal servants.[242]\r\nDr. Staunton, who was himself one of the Visitors, seems to have\r\nruled the College vigorously and wisely, though, very early in his\r\nPresidentship, there are signs of dissensions among the Fellows, due,\r\npossibly, to differences between the rival factions of Presbyterians\r\nand Independents. Any way, he knew how to maintain his authority. In\r\nthe record of punishments, made in the handwriting of the culprits\r\nthemselves, we find that, in 1651, four of the scholars were put out of\r\ncommons “usque ad dignam emendationem,” “till they had learnt to mend\r\ntheir ways,” for sitting in the President’s presence with their caps\r\non. The discipline appears to have been almost exceptionally stringent\r\nat this time. Amongst other curious entries, we find that Edward\r\nFowler, one of the clerks (subsequently Bishop of Gloucester), was\r\nsimilarly deprived of his commons for throwing bread at the opposite\r\nwindows of the students of Ch. Ch. (“eo quod alumnos Aedis Christi\r\npane projecto in tumultum provocavit”). Two scholars who had been\r\nfound walking in the town, without their gowns, about ten o’clock at\r\nnight, were put out of commons for a week, and ordered one to write\r\nout, in Greek, all the more notable parts of Aristotle’s Ethics, the\r\nother to write out, and commit to memory, all the definitions and\r\ndivisions of Burgersdyk’s Logic. Another scholar, for having in his\r\nroom some out-college men without leave and then joining with them in\r\ncreating a disturbance, was sentenced to be kept hard at work in the\r\nlibrary, from morning to evening prayers, for a month, a severe form of\r\npunishment which seems not to have been uncommon at this time. Under\r\nthe Puritan _régime_ there was certainly no danger of the retrogression\r\nof discipline.\r\n\r\nDr. Newlyn, with some of the ejected Fellows and scholars, returned to\r\nthe College, after the Restoration, in 1660. The old President lived\r\nto be over 90, dying within a few months of the Revolution of 1688,\r\nand having been President, including the years of his expulsion, over\r\n47 years. He is finely described in the monument to his memory, which\r\nstill exists in the College Chapel, as “ob fidem regi, ecclesiae,\r\ncollegio servatam annis fere XII. expulsus.” But the College does not\r\nseem to have gained in learning, discipline, or quiet, by the change of\r\ngovernment. The constant appeals to, or intervention of, the Visitor\r\n(George Morley) revealing to us, as they do, the internal dissensions\r\nof the Society itself, recall the troubled days of Cole’s presidency.\r\nNor does Newlyn himself seem to have been free from blame. His\r\ngovernment appears to have been lax, and his nepotism, even for those\r\ndays, was remarkable. During the first fourteen years after his return,\r\nno less than four Newlyns are found in the list of scholars, while,\r\nin the list of clerks and choristers (places exclusively in the gift\r\nof the President), the name Newlyn, for many years after his return,\r\noccurs more frequently than all other names taken together. It would\r\nappear as if there had been a perennial supply of sons, nephews, or\r\ngrandsons, to stop the avenues of preferment to less favoured students.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to turn from these unsatisfactory relations among\r\nthe seniors to a contemporary account[243] of his studies and his\r\nintercourse with his tutor, left by one of the scholars of this period,\r\nJohn Potenger, elected to a Hampshire Scholarship in 1664. From the\r\naccount of his candidature, it appears that, even then, there was an\r\neffective examination for the scholarships, though it only lasted a\r\nday and seems to have been entirely _vivâ voce_. It is curious to\r\nfind Potenger largely attributing his success to his age, “being some\r\nyears younger” than his rivals,[244] “a circumstance much considered\r\nby the electors.” Can the well-known preference of the Corpus electors\r\nfor boyish candidates in the days of Arnold and Keble, and even to a\r\ndate within the memory of living members of the College, have been a\r\ntradition from the seventeenth century? It appears that the tutor was\r\nthen selected by the student’s friends. “I had the good fortune,” says\r\nPotenger, “to be put to Mr. John Roswell” (afterwards Head Master of\r\nEton and a great benefactor of the Corpus library), “a man eminent\r\nfor learning and piety, whose care and diligence ought gratefully\r\nto be remembered by me as long as I live. I think he preserved me\r\nfrom ruin at my first setting out into the world. He did not only\r\nendeavour to make his pupils good scholars, but good men. He narrowly\r\nwatched my conversation” (_i. e._ behaviour), “knowing I had too many\r\nacquaintance in the University that I was fond of, though they were\r\nnot fit for me. Those he disliked he would not let me converse with,\r\nwhich I regretted much, thinking that, now I was come from school, I\r\nwas to manage myself as I pleased, which occasioned many differences\r\nbetween us for the first two years, which ended in an entire friendship\r\non both sides.” Potenger “did not immediately enter upon logick and\r\nphilosophy, but was kept for a full year to the reading of classical\r\nauthors, and making of theams in prose and verse.” The students still\r\nspoke Latin at dinner and supper; and consequently, at first, his\r\n“words were few.” There were still disputations in the hall, requiring\r\na knowledge of logic and philosophy; but Potenger’s taste was mainly\r\nfor the composition of Latin and English verse and for declamations.\r\nHis poetical efforts were so successful, that his tutor gave him\r\nseveral books “for an encouragement.” For his Bachelor’s degree he\r\nhad to perform not only public exercises in the schools, but private\r\nexercises in the College, a custom which survived long after this time.\r\nOne of these was a reading in the College Hall upon Horace. “I opened\r\nmy lectures with a speech which I thought pleased the auditors as\r\nwell as myself.” After taking his degree he fell into vicious habits\r\nwhich, though commenced in Oxford, were completed by his frequent\r\nvisits to London. “Though I was so highly criminal, yet I was not so\r\nnotorious as to incur the censure of the Governors of the College or\r\nthe University, but for sleeping out morning prayer, for which I was\r\nfrequently punished.” “The two last years I stayed in the University,\r\nI was Bachelour of Arts, and I spent most of my time in reading books\r\nwhich were not very common, as Milton’s works, Hobbs his Leviathan; but\r\nthey never had the power to subvert the principles which I had received\r\nof a good Christian and a good subject.” The exercises for his Master\r\nof Arts’ degree he speaks of as if they were difficult and laborious.\r\n\r\nThe century which elapsed from the Restoration to the accession of\r\nGeorge III. was, perhaps, the least distinguished and the least\r\nprofitable in the history of the University. In this lack of life and\r\ndistinction Corpus seems fully to have shared. With the exceptions\r\nof General Oglethorpe, the friend of Dr. Johnson, and the founder of\r\nGeorgia (who matriculated as a gentleman-commoner, in 1714), and John\r\nWhitaker (the author of a History of Manchester, &c.), not a single\r\nentry of any person who subsequently attained to distinction occurs in\r\nthe registers from the Restoration down to the election, as a scholar,\r\nof William Scott (afterwards Lord Stowell, the celebrated Admiralty\r\nJudge) in 1761. It may be noted too, as illustrating the moral level\r\nof these times, that the punishments, of which a record is still\r\npreserved, are no longer inflicted for the faults of boys, but for the\r\nvices of men.\r\n\r\nAt the period, however, which we have now reached, the College seems\r\nto have been recovering its pristine efficiency and reputation.\r\nRichard Lovell Edgeworth, the father of Miss Edgeworth, entered\r\nCorpus as a gentleman-commoner in 1761, his father having “prudently\r\nremoved him from Dublin.” “Having entered C. C. C., Oxford,” he\r\nsays,[245] “I applied assiduously not only to my studies under my\r\nexcellent tutor, Mr. Russell” (father of Dr. Russell, the Head-master\r\nof Charterhouse), “both in prose and verse. Scarcely a day passed\r\nwithout my having added to my stock of knowledge some new fact or idea;\r\nand I remember with satisfaction the pleasure I then felt from the\r\nconsciousness of intellectual improvement.” “I had the good fortune\r\nto make acquaintance with the young men, the most distinguished at C.\r\nC. for application, abilities, and good conduct. … I remember with\r\ngratitude that I was liked by my fellow-students, and I recollect\r\nwith pleasure the delightful and profitable hours I passed at that\r\nUniversity during three years of my life.” He tells some characteristic\r\nstories of Dr. Randolph, the “indulgent president” of that time,\r\nwhose “good humour made more salutary impression on the young men he\r\ngoverned than has ever been effected by the morose manners of any\r\nunrelenting disciplinarian.” It is curious to contrast the account of\r\nMr. Edgeworth’s Corpus experiences with that given by Gibbon of his\r\nMagdalen experiences some nine or ten years before this time, or with\r\nBentham’s account of his undergraduate life at Queen’s, which almost\r\ncoincided with that of Mr. Edgeworth at Corpus. Something, however,\r\nmay, perhaps, be set down to the difference of character and temper in\r\nthe men themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom Edgeworth’s time to this, the College has maintained its\r\neducational efficiency and reputation; and, though with occasional\r\nchanges of fortune, it has, notwithstanding its smallness, invariably\r\ntaken a high rank among the educational institutions of the University.\r\nConsidering the extreme smallness of its numbers at that time, the\r\nnumber of undergraduates varying from about sixteen to twenty, it is\r\ntruly remarkable to observe the large proportion of distinguished names\r\nwhich occur in the lists between 1761 and 1811. They comprise, taking\r\nthem in chronological order, William Scott (Lord Stowell), Richard\r\nLovell Edgeworth, Walker King (Bishop of Rochester), Thomas Burgess\r\n(Bishop of Salisbury), Richard Laurence (Archbishop of Cashel, author\r\nof a famous course of Bampton Lectures), Charles Abbott (Lord Chief\r\nJustice of the King’s Bench and Lord Tenterden), Edward Copleston\r\n(Provost of Oriel, Dean of St. Paul’s, and Bishop of Llandaff),\r\nHenry Phillpotts (Bishop of Exeter), Charles James Stewart (Bishop\r\nof Quebec), Thomas Grimstone Estcourt (Burgess for the University\r\nfrom 1826 to 1847), William Buckland (Dean of Westminster, the famous\r\ngeologist), John Keble, John Taylor Coleridge (better known as “Mr.\r\nJustice Coleridge”), and Thomas Arnold. These names, together with\r\nthose previously mentioned, namely, John Claymond, Ludovicus Vivès,\r\nEdward Wotton, Nicholas Kratzer, Cardinal Pole, Bishop Jewel, John\r\nReynolds, Richard Hooker, Thomas Jackson, William Fulman, General\r\nOglethorpe, John Whitaker, and some others which I will immediately\r\nsubjoin, may be taken as the list of distinguished men connected with\r\nor produced by Corpus, down to the time of Dr. Arnold. More recent\r\nnames I refrain from adding, partly owing to the invidious nature\r\nof such a selection, partly because they can easily be supplied by\r\nthose acquainted with the recent history of the University. The names\r\nalready mentioned, belonging to the period from 1516 to 1811, may\r\nbe supplemented by those of Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York and\r\nLord Chancellor to Queen Mary; William Cheadsey, third President\r\n(1558), who disputed with Peter Martyr in 1549, and with Cranmer in\r\n1554; Robert Pursglove, last Prior of Guisborough, and subsequently\r\nArchdeacon of Nottingham and Suffragan Bishop of Hull; Nicholas Udall\r\n(or Owdall), Headmaster of Eton; Richard Pates, Bishop of Worcester;\r\nJames Brookes, Bishop of Gloucester; Richard Pate, founder of the\r\nCheltenham Grammar School; (perhaps) Nicholas Wadham, the founder\r\nof Wadham College; Miles Windsor and Brian Twyne, who, like Fulman,\r\nwere famous Oxford antiquaries; Henry Parry, Bishop successively of\r\nGloucester and Worcester; Miles Smith, Bishop of Gloucester, and\r\none of the translators of the Bible; Sir Edwin Sandys, the pupil of\r\nHooker, and author of the _Europæ Speculum_; the “ever-memorable”\r\nJohn Hales of Eton; Edward Pococke, the celebrated Oriental scholar;\r\nDaniel Fertlough, Featley, or Fairclough, a famous theological\r\ncontroversialist, and one of the translators of the Bible; Robert\r\nFrampton, and his successor, Edward Fowler, Bishops of Gloucester;\r\nEdward Rainbow, Bishop of Carlisle; Basil Kennett; Richard Fiddes; and\r\nJohn Hume, Bishop of Oxford. To these names must be added one which\r\nis, perhaps, rather notorious than distinguished, that of the unhappy\r\nJames, Duke of Monmouth, the eldest natural son of Charles II. Wood\r\ntells us, in the _Fasti_, that in the plague year, 1665, when the King\r\nand Queen were in Oxford, the Duke’s name was entered on the books of\r\nC. C. College. But his name does not occur in the buttery-books till\r\nthe week beginning May 11, 1666, when it is inserted between the names\r\nof the President and Vice-President. Whether, after this time,[246] he\r\never resided in the College, or indeed in Oxford, is uncertain; but\r\nthe name remains on the books till July 12th, 1683, when it was erased\r\nafter the discovery of Monmouth’s conspiracy and flight. The erasures\r\nare carried back as far as the week beginning June 1.\r\n\r\nThe charming account of Corpus, its studies, and its youthful society,\r\ncontributed by Mr. Justice Coleridge to Stanley’s _Life of Arnold_, is\r\nso well known that it hardly requires more than a passing reference;\r\nbut, to complete my series of glimpses of the College at different\r\nperiods of its history, it may be well to revive the recollections of\r\nthe reader by a few brief extracts. “Arnold and I, as you know” (and,\r\nas we may add, the two Kebles, John and Thomas), “were undergraduates\r\nof Corpus Christi, a College very small in its numbers and humble\r\nin its buildings, but to which we and our fellow-students formed an\r\nattachment never weakened in the after course of our lives. … We were\r\nthen a small society, the members rather under the usual age, and with\r\nmore than the ordinary proportion of ability and scholarship: our mode\r\nof tuition was in harmony with these circumstances; not by private\r\nlectures, but in classes of such a size as excited emulation and made\r\nus careful in the exact and neat rendering of the original, yet not\r\nso numerous as to prevent individual attention on the tutor’s part,\r\nand familiar knowledge of each pupil’s turn and talents. … We were not\r\nentirely set free from the leading-strings of the school; accuracy\r\nwas cared for; we were accustomed to _vivâ voce_ rendering and _vivâ\r\nvoce_ question and answer in our lecture-room, before an audience\r\nof fellow-students whom we sufficiently respected. At the same time\r\nthe additional reading, trusted to ourselves alone, prepared us for\r\naccurate private study and for our final exhibition in the schools.\r\nOne result of all these circumstances was that we lived on the most\r\nfamiliar terms with each other; we might be--indeed we were--somewhat\r\nboyish in manner and in the liberties we took with each other: but our\r\ninterest in literature--ancient and modern--and in all the stirring\r\nmatters of that stirring time, was not boyish; we debated the classic\r\nand romantic question; we discussed poetry and history, logic and\r\nphilosophy; or we fought over the Peninsular battles and Continental\r\ncampaigns with the energy of disputants personally concerned in them.\r\nOur habits were inexpensive and temperate: one break-up party was held\r\nin the junior common-room at the end of each term, in which we indulged\r\nour genius more freely, and our merriment, to say the truth, was\r\nsomewhat exuberant and noisy; but the authorities wisely forbore too\r\nstrict an inquiry into this.”\r\n\r\nSoon after Arnold was elected Fellow of Oriel, in the autumn of\r\n1815 a scholar was elected at Corpus, William Phelps, afterwards\r\nArchdeacon of Carlisle, whose published letters[247] contain abundant\r\ninformation about the social condition and studies of the College.\r\nPhelps did not, like Arnold, possess those intellectual and social\r\ncharms which captivate undergraduate society, and it is plain that he\r\nwas in restricted circumstances. But he speaks enthusiastically of\r\nthe friendliness, tolerance, and good humour which pervaded the small\r\nsociety of undergraduates (only nine members of the foundation at\r\nthat time, namely, six undergraduate scholars, the remaining scholars\r\nbeing then B.A.’s or M.A.’s, and three exhibitioners; besides the six\r\ngentlemen-commoners, who dined at a separate table, and shared with\r\nthe Bachelors a separate common-room), and he is constantly recurring\r\nin terms of respect and appreciation, which bear evident marks of\r\nsincerity, to the friendliness, helpfulness, and competence of the two\r\ntutors, as well as to the kindly interest shown in their juniors by\r\nthe other senior members of the College. The relations were those of a\r\nlarge and harmonious family. “There are no parties or divisions here as\r\nat other Colleges; each desires to oblige his neighbour. The Fellows\r\nare not supercilious, the scholars are respectful. There is only one\r\nestablishment that rivals ours in literature, which is our neighbour\r\nOriel.”\r\n\r\nThrough the combined action of the Parliamentary Commissions of 1852\r\nand 1877, the constitution of the College has been largely altered. By\r\nthe reception of commoners, though it still remains a small College,\r\nthe number of its undergraduate members has risen from about twenty\r\nto about seventy. The county restrictions have been removed from the\r\nFellowships and scholarships, all of which are now entirely open. The\r\nnumber of Fellowships (from which the obligation to Holy Orders has\r\nbeen now removed) has been diminished, while that of the scholarships\r\nhas been increased. And, in the spirit of the original intentions of\r\nthe founder, a considerable proportion of the revenues has been devoted\r\nto the creation or augmentation of University Professorships. If, by\r\nthe operation of these changes, the College has lost something of its\r\nunique character, it may be hoped that it has proportionately extended\r\nits sphere of usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nCHRIST CHURCH.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. R. ST. JOHN TYRWHITT, M.A., FORMERLY RHETORIC READER OF\r\nCHRIST CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this volume we apprehend that the history of Christ\r\nChurch, Oxford, means chiefly its academical history, which begins in\r\n1524 with the foundation of Cardinal College by Wolsey, in the ancient\r\nPriory of St. Frideswide’s. All his buildings and other works were\r\nstopped by his fall in 1529; and three years afterwards “bluff Harry\r\nbroke into the spence” with his usual vigour, and refounded Cardinal\r\nCollege, to which he gave his own name, calling it “King Henry the\r\nEighth his College.” Then he suppressed it, and re-constituted the\r\nwhole foundation, November 4th, 1546; removing the new see of Oxford\r\n(erected at Oseney in 1542) to St. Frideswide’s, the then church,\r\nwith the style of “The Cathedral Church of Christ in Oxford.” This\r\nfoundation comprised a Dean and Canons, with other capitular or\r\ndiocesan officers, besides an academic staff, and probably numerous\r\nscholars of different ages. The ancient church has had a twofold\r\ncharacter ever since. It is the Cathedral of the diocese, but it is\r\nalso the College chapel; and as the Dean of Christ Church is always\r\npresent, and the Bishop of Oxford very seldom, academic uses and\r\nappearances rather prevail over the ecclesiastical, in a way which may\r\nhave been the reverse of satisfactory to more than one occupant of the\r\nsee of Oxford.\r\n\r\nBut the connection between the Chapter and the College cannot be\r\nsevered; and as Christ Church certainly would not be itself without its\r\nmost ancient buildings, some account of its ecclesiastical foundations\r\n(of almost pre-historic antiquity) seems highly advisable before we\r\nattempt to chronicle it as a seat of learning.\r\n\r\nSt. Frideswide’s College certainly existed from of old in Wolsey’s\r\ntime. Her story has passed through the hands of Philip, her third\r\nNorman prior; through William of Malmesbury’s and John of Tynemouth’s;\r\nand is found in Leland’s _Collectanea_. It runs as follows.[248]\r\nAbout A.D. 727 an alderman, or _subregulus_, of the name of Didan is\r\ndiscovered ruling in all honour over the populous city of Mercian\r\nOxford. He and his wife Saffrida have a daughter called Frideswide. She\r\nembraces the monastic life with twelve other maidens. Her father, at\r\nher mother’s death, builds a conventual church in honour of St. Mary\r\nand All Saints, and thereof makes her prioress. The munificent kings\r\nof Mercia also build inns or halls in the vicinity.[249] This seems to\r\nanticipate even Alfred’s imagined foundation of University College; and\r\nis therefore to be adhered to as dogma for the present by all members\r\nof the larger House. But Mr. Boase’s remarks on the probabilities of\r\nthe story are strongly in its favour.\r\n\r\nMany days and troubles passed over St. Frideswide’s Church, or its\r\nsite. It was wholly or partially burnt in the massacre of Danes in\r\n1002; also in 1015. It was rebuilt and made a “cell” or dependency of\r\nthe great monastery of Abingdon. It became a house of Secular Canons,\r\nwho were dispossessed after the Conquest; when a Norman church was\r\nconstructed by restoration of the old Saxon one, whose foundations,\r\nhowever, exist and form part of the actual structure still. The present\r\nchapter-house, or rather its doorway, may have belonged to this period.\r\nIt is justly celebrated as a fair specimen of Norman architecture,\r\nand is considered by several authorities to be more ancient, not\r\nonly than the chapter-house itself (which, however, Sir Gilbert Scott\r\nplaces about the middle of the thirteenth century; see _Report_, p.\r\n7), but than the old nave and transept walls, which are generally\r\ntaken as twelfth century, if we must reject Dr. Ingram’s belief in\r\nthem as Ethelred’s,[250] grateful as it must be to all members of the\r\nfoundation. The doorway certainly bears marks of fire, which may be\r\nreferred to the conflagration of 1190, when a great part of Oxford was\r\ndestroyed.[251]\r\n\r\nTen years before, the body of St. Frideswide had been translated from\r\nits resting place to the north choir aisle, to be again (but not till\r\none hundred and ten years after, on 10th September, 1289) removed to\r\na new and more costly shrine in the Lady Chapel, which had been added\r\nto that aisle early in the thirteenth century, or between that and the\r\nnorth choir aisle.\r\n\r\nHer first regular prior, Guimond, had been employed till his death\r\nin 1141, in the re-arrangements of monastic buildings which would\r\nbe necessary on the change, at the Conquest, from Secular Canons to\r\nRegular Augustinians. Both he and his successor, Robert of Cricklade,\r\nseem to have been wise and well-meaning ecclesiastics; and a school\r\nwas connected with the convent which really may be considered as the\r\noriginal germ of the historical University.\r\n\r\nRobert of Cricklade spent much labour upon the present structure,\r\ntower, nave, transepts, and choir; and the works were far enough\r\nadvanced in 1180, under prior Philip, for St. Frideswide’s first\r\ntranslation. Then, we presume, the fire of 1190 gave occasion to some\r\nre-constructions, and let in Transitional Architecture, of which\r\nsomething has to be said here. The term “transitional” seems to mean\r\nchange or progress in a style (as from the round to the pointed arch\r\nin Gothic-Romanesque), where principles and rules are adhered to; not\r\nattempts to combine incongruous styles. England is full of transitions,\r\nthrough Norman to Early English, to Decorated, and so on; and they\r\nseem natural, and not lawless or contradictory. But the Roman way of\r\nencrusting their own great vaults and arches with Greek lintels and\r\npediments, constructively useless, is a different and worse thing--just\r\nas bad as the Baroque or Fancy Renaissance. Still, a mixture of pure\r\nelements is at all events a pure mixture; and in Christ Church the\r\nRomanesque, Norman, and Decorated features are all of the best. The\r\nnorth-east walls and turrets might remind one of the Cathedral of\r\nMainz or of Trier; while the Chapter-house door is fine Norman, and\r\nthe Early-Decorated windows excellent in their way. It was just at\r\nthis time of the later twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, when\r\nNorthern builders were eliminating all traces of the Greek or trabeated\r\nstructure, that the new or pointed arch began to present itself, and be\r\nwelcomed here and there, just for its beauty’s sake. In Christ Church\r\nthe arches of the nave, and other principal ones, are round, but two\r\nof the four which carry the tower are pointed; the greater supporting\r\npower of the latter form may have been already observed.\r\n\r\nThe ancient interior must have been one of considerable beauty from the\r\ntwelfth to the sixteenth century, when Wolsey destroyed three bays of\r\nthe west end of the nave, reducing it to one-half its original length;\r\nand probably his name must also be associated with the lowering of\r\nall the roofs. If he executed the beautiful choir-vaulting, that is\r\nno small merit to balance these destructions; but it is questioned.\r\nThe curious treatment of the side arcades should be noticed; the solid\r\npillars of the twelfth century have been ingeniously divided in their\r\nthickness; the halves facing the aisle have been left in their natural\r\nproportions, while those which face the central nave have been raised\r\nso as to embrace the triforium stage.[252]\r\n\r\nThe upper stage of the Cathedral tower with its spire, twice since\r\nrebuilt, belongs to the thirteenth century, like the chapter-house; and\r\njust within that century (1289) is a second northern aisle, built as a\r\nLady Chapel, and containing a new shrine of St. Frideswide. The curious\r\nwooden structure at present existing is really the watching-chamber of\r\nthe shrine erected in the next century, and is placed on the donor’s\r\ntomb in all probability, instead of the saint’s.\r\n\r\nThe large chapel, now called the Latin, and formerly the Divinity\r\nChapel, was added in the next (fourteenth) century, to the north of\r\nthe northern choir aisle, by building two more bays eastward to the\r\nnorth-east chapel of the thirteenth century just mentioned. This is\r\ncalled “the dormitory,” being the burial-place of several deans and\r\ncanons; the word is a simple translation of the Greek _cœmeterium_,\r\nor sleeping-place, applied to the catacombs of Rome from the second\r\ncentury. Windows were now altered from Norman to Decorated; three\r\nof which at the East end of the choir are again restored to their\r\noriginal style. In 1340 the Lady Elizabeth de Montacute gave the\r\nconvent the present Christ Church meadow in order to maintain a chantry\r\nin the Lady Chapel. Her tomb is between that chapel and the other on\r\nthe north-east, near a prior’s (Robert de Ewelme’s or Alexander de\r\nSutton’s), and near also to that of Sir George Nowers, a companion of\r\nthe Black Prince.\r\n\r\nImportant alterations began towards the end of the fifteenth century:\r\nthe choir clerestory was remodelled, the rich vaulting (probably)\r\nadded, and various side windows altered to the Perpendicular style,\r\nwhich was then extending its rigid rule over England.\r\n\r\nThe great north transept window and the wooden roof of the transepts\r\nand tower (that of the nave is later) are early sixteenth-century. But\r\nat the end of the first quarter of that century (1524) came Wolsey’s\r\ngreat scheme for Cardinal College, with its good and evil. The latter\r\nmay be soon disposed of; he certainly spoilt St. Frideswide’s Church\r\nby cutting off its three western bays for his great quadrangle. His\r\nintended Perpendicular Church on the north side of that quadrangle\r\nwould hardly have atoned, with all its magnificence, for the\r\ndestruction of the nave, which (even now, when partially restored) is\r\nan affliction to the spectator as he enters the double doors.\r\n\r\nBut from Wolsey’s time the whole society became academic, as he had\r\nintended, rather than monastic, and its new architecture is henceforth\r\nsecular. Unfortunately, it is not quite in that truest collegiate\r\nstyle, or rather scale, which is best represented by the quadrangles\r\nof Brasenose and Merton, St. John’s and Wadham Colleges; but its\r\nhall, gate-tower, and library have been chief sights of Oxford from\r\ntheir foundation. The principal quadrangles are too extensive and\r\npublic-looking to wear the old Oxford air of slight seclusion and great\r\ncomfort, of a life just as monastic as you please and no more.\r\n\r\nWolsey’s Hall[253] and Tower,[254] then, the stone kitchen, and the\r\neast, south and west sides of the great quadrangle belong to the same\r\nsixteenth century group of buildings as Magdalen Tower (1505), the\r\nTower of St. Mary Magdalene Church at the end of Broad Street, and\r\nBrasenose Gate.\r\n\r\nJohn Hygden was appointed by Wolsey the first Dean of his College.\r\nAlready before the foundation of his College, and in preparation for\r\nit, Wolsey had instituted lectureships and appointed lecturers--the\r\nearliest of them in 1518, others at later dates. A few names of these\r\nmay be added here. Thomas Brynknell, of Lincoln College, presided over\r\nDivinity; over Law, probably Ludovicus Vives, a Spaniard; and over\r\nMedicine, Thomas Musgrave of Merton College. Philosophy was committed\r\nto “one L. B.,” apparently Laurence Barber, M.A., Fellow of All\r\nSouls. In Mathematics the Lecturer was Kraske, or Kratcher, in fact,\r\nthe well-known Kratzer, maker of the Corpus sun-dial and of that on\r\nthe south side of St. Mary’s. The Greek lecture was held by Matthew\r\nCalphurne, a Greek. “Whether,” says Wood, “William Grocyn then taught\r\nit also I know not; sure it is that he, after he had been instructed in\r\nItaly by those exquisite masters, Demetrius Chalcondila, and Angelus\r\nPolitianus, read the Greek tongue several years to the Oxonians.” The\r\nRhetoric and Humanity Lecturer was John Clements of C. C. C., called\r\n“Clemens meus” by Sir Thomas More; his successor in the lecture was\r\nThomas Lupset.\r\n\r\nWhen King Henry VIII. reconstituted Wolsey’s College under his\r\nown name, he reconstituted also some of these lectures of Wolsey’s\r\nfoundation, calling them “the King’s Lectures.” The King’s Lecturer in\r\nDivinity in 1535 was Richard Smyth of Merton College, who seems to have\r\nretired before the prospect of holding a disputation with Peter Martyr,\r\nwho was made Canon of Christ Church in 1550. He lived to be restored\r\nto his chair in 1554; but was soon succeeded by Friar John de Villa\r\nGarcina, a young Spanish friar greatly regarded, who seems to have been\r\nthe friar who tried to convert Cranmer at the last, and disappeared in\r\n1558. Dr. Hygden was reappointed Dean by the King, but died within a\r\nfew months, and was succeeded by Dr. Richard Oliver. Among the canons\r\nsecular of the second foundation were Robert Wakefield, a famous\r\nHebraist; John Leland, the learned antiquary; and Sir John Cheke,\r\nafterwards tutor to Edward VI.\r\n\r\nThe new see of Oxford remained at Oseney from 1542 to 1546; and\r\nthe King transferred it to his College in Oxford by letters patent\r\nof November 4th in the latter year. He styles it in his foundation\r\ncharter, “Ecclesia Christi Cathedralis Oxon ex fundatione Regis\r\nHenrici octavi;” combining the form of a Cathedral with that of an\r\nacademic College. This foundation consisted of a bishop, a dean, eight\r\ncanons, eight petty canons or chaplains, a gospeller and a postiller\r\n(Bible-clerk), eight singing-clerks, eight choristers and their master,\r\na schoolmaster and usher, an organist, sixty scholars or students,\r\nand forty “children,” corresponding we presume to the junior students\r\nof later days. Perhaps the children, as in later days occasionally,\r\nproved too childish; at all events the whole scholastic part of\r\nthe establishment, usher and all, was soon replaced by one hundred\r\nstudents, who, with the one “outcomer” of the Thurston foundation,[255]\r\nare still nightly told (or tolled) by a corresponding number of strokes\r\non “the mighty Tom,” or great bell. Gates are closed all over Oxford\r\nfive minutes after it is concluded.\r\n\r\nA royal foundation by King or minister, “whose hand searches out all\r\nthe land,” is more likely to come in contact with history than a\r\nprivate one; and Christ Church was soon involved in the early troubles\r\nof the Reformation. Wolsey had done more and other things than he\r\nknew of in inviting his Cambridge scholars to Cardinal College. One\r\nmay say that the first Christ Church men had true martyrs among them;\r\ncertainly that they were early made to face danger and death for the\r\nfaith that was in them. Anthony Dalaber’s description of the scene in\r\n“Frideswide,” on the arrest of Garrett and discovery of his books,\r\nas given in Froude’s history, vol. ii. p. 48, _sqq._, is not to be\r\nomitted. He had just sent forth poor Garrett from his Gloucester\r\nHall rooms, in such lay-clothes as he possessed, only to be taken at\r\nBristol; and went himself to Frideswide or Cardinal College (he uses\r\nboth terms), “to speak with that worthy martyr of God, Master Clark,”\r\nsoon to perish in the hands of the Bishop of Lincoln; with the words\r\n“Crede et manducasti,” when Communion was refused him at the last.\r\nDalaber takes Corpus on his way, having “faithful brethren” there, as\r\nmight have been expected in Fox’s new foundation. He passes through\r\nPeckwater Inn, we presume, and through the half-finished buildings\r\nof the new quadrangle, and reaches the half-ruined Church, not yet\r\nCathedral. “Evensong was begun,” he says; “the Dean (Hygden) and\r\nthe Canons were there, in their gray amices; they were almost at\r\nMagnificat before I came thither. I stood in the choir door,[256] and\r\nheard Master Taverner play, and others of the chapel there sing, with\r\nand among whom I myself was wont to sing also; but now my singing and\r\nmusic were turned into sighing and musing. As I there stood, in cometh\r\nDr. Cottisford,[257] the commissary, as fast as ever he could go,\r\nbareheaded, as pale as ashes (I knew his grief well enough); and to\r\nthe dean he goeth into the choir, where he was sitting in his stall,\r\nand talked with him very sorrowfully; what, I know not, but whereof I\r\nmight and did truly guess. I went aside from the choir door to see and\r\nhear more. The commissary and dean came out of the choir, wonderfully\r\ntroubled as it seemed. About the middle of the church met them Dr.\r\nLondon,[258] puffing, blustering, and blowing, like a hungry and greedy\r\nlion seeking his prey. They talked together awhile; but the commissary\r\nwas much blamed by them, insomuch that he wept for sorrow.”\r\n\r\nMany men and women were to do the same for similar troubles in the\r\nyears that were to follow; and the failure, as it seemed, of Wolsey’s\r\nbest intentions as to his College must have been one of the griefs\r\nwhich were now beginning to accumulate round him; acting also, as it\r\nmust have acted, on the perturbed spirit of his dread master.\r\n\r\nChrist Church was founded in suffering and danger suited to the name\r\nit bears; though as yet, to do them justice, most of the persecutors\r\nseemed to have been heartily distressed at their new duties. A\r\ngeneration so wofully afraid of death and privation as our own should\r\nnot think too harshly of the severities of men who feared neither.\r\nThe sufferings of those times have certainly left their traces on\r\nthe features of many of Holbein’s sitters. I remember observing this\r\nparticularly in the lay portraits of his school at the late “Tudor\r\nExhibition” in London. His faces of soldiers and country gentlemen are\r\nrather meditative than fierce; though almost always with a turn of\r\nrecklessness, in reserve, as it were. They frequently express rather\r\ndubiety than doubt; as of men of conscience whom conscience might\r\nendanger.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to another crisis of history, it seems best to bring\r\nour account of the College buildings to the middle of the present\r\ncentury--for the later nineteenth century has done more than any other\r\nperiod in judicious repair and effective restoration.\r\n\r\nIn 1630, Brian Duppa being Dean, the choir suffered a sweeping\r\nrestoration, when many gravestones and monuments were destroyed, and\r\nothers removed to the aisles, having been duly deprived of their\r\nbrasses. Some of them bore “Saxon” inscriptions (Gutch’s Wood’s\r\n_Colleges and Halls_, p. 462). There certainly were chapters in those\r\ndays, with the average disregard for earlier dates than their own, and\r\nfor the interesting heraldry of the cathedral, which extended, as Dr.\r\nIngram says, “from the blazonry of Montacute, Monthermer, Mountfort,\r\nand Courtenay, to the pencase and inkhorn of Zouch in the north aisle\r\nof the transept.” However, the Parliament would have done it if the\r\ncapitular body had refrained. They might also have cut away all the\r\ntracery of the windows north and south; but they would not have filled\r\nthe two-light holes thus obtained with Van Linge’s queer Dutch glass,\r\nsome of which was extant in our undergraduate days. Dean Duppa must\r\nhave been a cultured and well-meaning man of taste in the lower English\r\nRenaissance, and he wrote a life of Michael Angelo; but we shall for\r\nlife retain the impression of an immense yellow pumpkin in one of\r\nthe north-west windows, illustrative of the history of Jonah, which\r\nalways caught our eyes in going out of chapel, and while it lasts will\r\npreserve Duppa’s name from oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Wolsey’s unfinished church seem to have been for a\r\nwhile something of an encumbrance to the path from Peckwater to the\r\nCathedral; and the present way under the deanery arch is due to Dean\r\nSamuel Fell, father of Bishop (and Dean) John Fell, who made it\r\nthrough his garden. The way up to the Hall was then very incomplete,\r\nand he “made it as it is now, by the help of one Smith, an artificer\r\nof London;” and built the arch as it now is, besides re-edifying the\r\ncloister.\r\n\r\nThe north side of the great quadrangle was completed by Bishop\r\nFell; and a balustrade was substituted on the roof for the original\r\nbattlements, possibly for the purpose of lecturing from the housetop, a\r\ncourse which, however, has not been pursued in recent times. Tom Tower\r\nwas finished by Wren in 1682; Tom himself (the bell) having been recast\r\nby Christopher Hodson in 1680. He, or his original metal, was once the\r\nold clock bell of Oseney Abbey.[259]\r\n\r\nThe original grant of Peckwater Inn to St. Frideswide’s is as early\r\nas Henry III.’s time. Dean Aldrich and Dr. Anthony Radcliffe are\r\nanswerable for the present structure, which contains seventy-two sets\r\nof rooms and a canon’s lodgings. Dr. Radcliffe also gave a statue\r\n“Mercury” to adorn the central fountain in the great quadrangle, which\r\nhad originally issued from a sphere, as seen in old prints. Long ago,\r\nbefore the Reformation, there is said to have been a cross in the place\r\nnow occupied by the fountain, with a pulpit, from which Wycliffe may\r\nhave frequently preached. The base of this cross is preserved in the\r\ngallery at the end of the S. Transept.\r\n\r\nThe common-room under the hall, was fitted up by Dr. Busby, whose bust\r\nin marble long adorned it, but is now transferred to the library. This\r\nbust is a work of merit, with a countenance unlikely to spare for\r\nanybody’s crying. The room is panelled with oak, and contains a Nineveh\r\ntablet presented by Hormuzd Rassam, Esq.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the Old Library was once the Refectory of St.\r\nFrideswide’s convent. A few books remain in charge of the Margaret\r\nProfessor. The large Library in Peckwater was begun in 1716, but not\r\nfinally completed till 1761. The original intention was to leave an\r\nopen piazza beneath it, but the space was required for its books and\r\ncollections, and its massive columns were accordingly connected by\r\na wall. Its gallery of pictures (or the bulk of the collection) was\r\nthe gift of Brigadier-General Guise in 1765, and of the Hon. W. F.\r\nFox-Strangeways in 1828.\r\n\r\nCanterbury Gate was built by Wyatt in 1778; and we presume that the\r\nlaws of gravity and attraction will continue to apply to it as to\r\nother objects, so that it may reasonably be expected to remain there\r\ntill it is taken away. QVOD BENE VORTAT, as the Bodleian motto, with\r\npantheistic piety, observes.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to say, that the present Meadow buildings occupy\r\nthe position of the Chaplains’ quadrangle and Fell’s buildings, or\r\n“the garden staircase” of other days, up to 1863. Their gate-tower\r\nis not admired; otherwise they are a solid and beautiful building in\r\nquasi-Italian Gothic. Their quadrangle is bounded on the north by the\r\nold library, on the south by the meadow, on the east by the Margaret\r\nProfessor’s garden, and on the west by the vast and venerable kitchen,\r\nwith its time-honoured gridiron, happily employed in culinary labours\r\nonly, and never (so far as we know) for purposes of persecution. The\r\nkitchen was said to be the first-completed of all Wolsey’s buildings,\r\ngreatly to the amusement of the outer world of Oxford. This recognition\r\nof the dependence of the spirit on the body was ingeniously defended by\r\nthe Rev. M. Creighton[260] in a well-remembered University sermon.\r\n\r\nChrist Church has naturally had from the first its share of pageant and\r\nfestivity. Henry VIII. took his pastime therein in 1533 with grandeur\r\nand jollity. There were public declamations of the whole University\r\nhere under Edward VI.; and plays were acted in the hall before Queen\r\nElizabeth in 1566 and 1592, and before James I. in 1605 and 1621; and\r\nagain before Charles I. in 1636. It is a question whether scenery and\r\nstage-mechanism were used for the first time in England, says Anthony\r\nà Wood, on this occasion, or as early as the festivity of 1605. All\r\nare gone by this time who could remember the visit of the allied\r\nsovereigns in 1814, and their entertainment in the Hall by the Prince\r\nRegent, on whom the title of “the first gentleman in Europe” then sat\r\nvery gracefully. Old General Blücher, as best regarded of all foreign\r\nsoldiers present, had to acknowledge his honours in German, and the\r\nPrince translated him with freedom and elegance, only omitting his own\r\npraises.\r\n\r\nFour years after Charles I.’s entertainment, were to develop the full\r\nbitterness of evil days already begun. On August 18th, 1642, came the\r\nfirst Cavalier muster; three hundred and fifty and more of “privileged”\r\nUniversity men and their servants, and also many scholars. They met at\r\nthe Schools and marched by High Street to Christ Church, “where in the\r\ngreat quadrangle they were reasonably instructed in the word of command\r\nand their postures;” and this mustering and drilling continued more or\r\nless till the end of all things by surrender on St. John’s Day, 1646.\r\nSome considerable part of the corps were bowmen volunteers (about 1200,\r\nit is said further on), duly armed with “barbed arrows.” By that time,\r\nout of the one hundred and one students of Christ Church twenty were\r\nofficers in the King’s army; the rest, almost to a man, were either\r\nthere, or formed part of the Oxford garrison. And so of commoners in\r\nfull proportion. All plate and available money were gone, and the House\r\nas much damaged, not to say demoralized, as the rest of the University.\r\n\r\nLord Say had at first occupied Oxford with a Parliamentary force for a\r\nfew days, and carried away much plate from Christ Church, particularly\r\nall Dr. Samuel Fell’s (the Dean’s). Iconoclasm began with his zealous\r\nfollowers, not quite to his satisfaction, as it included a precious\r\nstatue of the King at New College. This was September 19th. On October\r\n29th, just after Edgehill, the King occupied Oxford, keeping his Court\r\nin Christ Church with Prince Charles as long as he remained.\r\n\r\nAnother ominous vespers in Christ Church Cathedral, besides Anthony\r\nDalaber’s, is on record. On Friday, February 3rd, 1643-4, his Majesty\r\nappointed a thanksgiving to be made at Evening Prayer at Christ Church\r\nfor the taking of Cirencester by Prince Rupert the day before. The\r\ndoctors were in their red robes; and polished breast-plates and laced\r\nbuff-coats must have had a brilliant effect under the massive white\r\narches. “But there was no new Form of Thanksgiving said, save only that\r\nForm for the victory of Edgehill, and a very solemn anthem, with this\r\nseveral times repeated therein--‘Thou shalt set a Crown of pure gold\r\nupon his Head, and upon his Head shall his Crown flourish.’”\r\n\r\nThe scarlet gowns appeared again to welcome the Queen at Tom Gate on\r\nJuly 13th, 1644. There was a fair show of state in the way of trumpets,\r\nheralds, and the like; and “Garter, coming last, was accompanied\r\nby the Mayor of Oxon in his scarlet and mace on his shoulder.” But\r\nNaseby field ended all pageant and hope alike in July 1645, just after\r\nFairfax’s siege of fifteen days on the Headington Hill side without\r\nresult. The next two years must have been a miserable time.\r\n\r\nIn April 1648, at the “visitation” by the Parliamentary Visitors, the\r\nDean of Christ Church (Dr. Samuel Fell) being in custody in London,\r\nMrs. Fell and her children, with certain ladies, elected to be carried\r\nout of the Deanery rather than walk out, and were deposited in the\r\nquadrangle in feminine protest against extrusion. Her husband’s name\r\nwas scored out of the Buttery-Book, with those of seven Canons, the\r\neighth (Dr. Robert Sanderson) being respited during absence; and Dr.\r\nEdward Reynolds was substituted, with a new set of Canons. A clean\r\nsweep was at the same time made of all “malignant” members, hardly any\r\ntaking the Parliamentary Oath or the Solemn League and Covenant. In\r\nJanuary 1647-8 the Latin version of the Common Prayer, and the Common\r\nPrayer itself, ceased in Christ Church. It was maintained by three\r\nChrist Church men--John Fell, Richard Allestree, and John Dolben--till\r\nthe Restoration, in a house in Merton Street, and seems to have escaped\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nA less dire debate than the Parliamentary War was the celebrated\r\ncontroversy with Bentley on _The Epistles of Phalaris_ in 1695. It\r\ndeserves notice in a chapter on Christ Church.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Charles Boyle, afterwards second Earl of Orrery, is wickedly\r\ndescribed by Bentley as “the young gentleman of great hopes, whose\r\nname is set to the new edition” of _Phalaris_; and, as Boyle was but\r\nnineteen years of age at the time of publication, it may be considered\r\ncertain that he received very material assistance from Dr. Atterbury,\r\nDr. Friend, and from the admired Dean Aldrich. Perhaps all four had a\r\nvery different idea of accurate criticism from that style of it which\r\nBentley initiated in England, and which now seems somewhat overpowered\r\nby the burden of its research. The celebrated answer to Bentley’s\r\n_Dissertation_, published under Boyle’s name in 1689, was really a\r\njoint production of the leading Christ Church men, and Atterbury\r\nclaimed a principal share. Between them they made a good fight for it;\r\nbut it is difficult for any set of men, however learned, ingenious,\r\nand petulantly witty, to maintain a long controversy at the stress of\r\nbeing wholly wrong. Unquestionably it was premature in Aldrich to set\r\nyoung noblemen in their teens to publish editions of writers believed\r\nto have been contemporary with Pythagoras or thereabouts. Nevertheless\r\nsuch critical work as they could do would probably teach them something\r\nmore than a dilettante knowledge of language: and this the Dean\r\nevidently understood to be a chief want of his time. Boyle was no match\r\nfor Bentley; but he came to be an accomplished and gallant gentleman\r\nwho never through a stirring life forsook the love of learning, or of\r\nhis old abode of learning--perhaps rather, of literature. He could see\r\nthe vast shapes of the natural sciences advancing with new wonders;\r\nand was the benefactor of George Graham, who named his great planetary\r\ninstrument after his title. His gifts to the Christ Church Library\r\nshould be commemorated; and he is one instance out of a great number of\r\nmen who have made Christ Church to themselves a home of friends, and so\r\nfrom their Alma Mater forward have faced the world together.\r\n\r\nAldrich could not work miracles of discipline or reform the manners of\r\nthe Restoration. He has been blamed for allowing too much license to\r\npupils of high degree, and because he failed to correct the habits of\r\nintemperance in which many of them had been educated. It may have been\r\nso; and he must suffer with all tutors. The very name connotes a false\r\nposition, and a most difficult duty; to find means to persuade without\r\nany power to control, and to reduce untamed lads to order who have\r\nnever seen it before. Military service was the only alternative method\r\nin that day, where they regulated each other’s folly by the duello, or\r\nat all events might be referred to the provost-marshal. But Aldrich\r\nhad to do what he could by the way of letters and culture; to try to\r\nawaken the higher instincts, the better ambitions, and natural virtues;\r\nsince every religious restraint was scouted as Puritanism and every\r\ndevout aspiration as Popery. He had to contend with a most dissipated\r\nand drunken age, whose coarse and direct temptations had already a hold\r\non his charge; nor is it easy to see how he could cure what St. John,\r\nPulteney, Carteret, and the rest had learned in evil homes and schools.\r\nThe morale of the aristocracy was still that of a beaten army; nor was\r\nthe public’s much better.\r\n\r\nAldrich’s many accomplishments have left varied traces behind them.\r\n“The merry Christ Church Bells,” the celebrated catch, is a living\r\nremembrance of him, happier than most men leave; Peckwater Quadrangle\r\nwould be stately and handsome enough, but for the leprous Headington\r\nstone; he must have had the Themistoclean power of doing just what was\r\nwanted at the time. But his achievement was after all the Oxford Logic.\r\nTill twenty years ago, most tutors found that all its shortcomings led\r\nstraight to explanations. It was like the noble and kindly conservatism\r\nof Mansel, to spend his great learning on the notes and prolegomena\r\nwhich have developed the good old manual into a valuable treatise on\r\nLogic and Psychology.\r\n\r\nThe name of Cyril Jackson marks a period of twenty-six years from\r\n1783-1809, which may be compared to Aldrich’s best days with better\r\ndiscipline. His life marks a restoration of order and efficiency in\r\nChrist Church which has never been lost, and he chose to have no\r\nother monument. He was wedded to his House, and it was enough for\r\none lifetime to make her love and obey him as he did. His statue and\r\npicture give the idea of clearness, courage, and benevolence. The\r\nstraightforward face is unconsciously commanding, and seems made to\r\njudge of a man. There is a dignity of presence; but Christ Church never\r\nwas yet governed by deportment only, and there must have been much\r\nmore than that about the great Dean who would be nothing more than\r\nDean. _Spartam nactus est, hanc exornabat_: and Jackson’s discipline,\r\nif not Spartan, was perfectly real. He did not invent new rules; but\r\nworked the old ones with a just and determined spirit, using “all the\r\nadvantages which a capacious mind, an enlarged knowledge of the world,\r\na spirit of command or guidance, and an unconquerable perseverance,\r\ncould confer.” I have heard old country gentlemen speak of Jackson,\r\nstill seeming to delight in him as a beloved person whom it was natural\r\nto obey, and as a leader of men sure to lead right.\r\n\r\nJackson’s daily system of work has only of late been changed to suit\r\nthe needs of continual examinations. The terminal “Collections” or\r\nExaminations from his time to the end of Dean Gaisford’s, were intended\r\nto supply the want of general University Examinations before their\r\nregular institution; and many have thought that the pass-work for a\r\nDegree had better be done in College, since the College presents the\r\ncandidate. The weekly themes and Latin verses in the Hall are gone;\r\nbut the Bachelors’ prizes for Latin prose; the Undergraduates’ for\r\nhexameters; the public lectures in logic, grammar, and mathematics; the\r\nCensor’s annual address to the whole House, were in full force thirty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nOne more curious tradition remains of his subtle influence--that\r\nall the handwriting of the leading Christ Church Dons of the last\r\ngeneration is imitated from their chief’s; with great difference of\r\ncharacter, but strong relation to his thoroughly-formed letters, to\r\nthe graceful unhurried hand that everybody can read easily. This has\r\nbeen said of Dean Gaisford and many Censors of earlier days; Osborne\r\nGordon’s writing, though, has a freedom of its own.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief secret of Cyril Jackson’s success was that he did his\r\nwork so much himself; and yet was always Dean. He would have order in\r\nCollege; and he had a regular police to enforce it, and attended to it\r\nhimself. He entertained his undergraduates daily, seven or eight at a\r\ntime, all round. He lectured and taught personally in Greek, logic, and\r\ncomposition, sometimes in mathematics. He tried to understand and make\r\nthe acquaintance of every youth in the House; and like St. Paul, he\r\nwas all desire to impart any excellent gift. When he felt his strength\r\nfailing in his work, he gave it up. He had refused bishoprics and an\r\narchbishopric; he bade farewell to Christ Church and the world in love\r\nunfeigned, and turned his spirit wholly to God whom he desired, and\r\nso died full of years and honours; nor can we anywhere find a word\r\nabout him that is not in his praise. Dr. Parr, who professed a not\r\nill-natured hostility to “the Æde-Christians,” forgets it heartily and\r\nwith handsome language when he speaks of the Dean (see _Notes to Spital\r\nSermon_, published 1800)--“Long have I thought and often have I said\r\nthat the highest station in an ecclesiastical establishment would not\r\nbe more than an adequate recompense for the person who presides over\r\nthis College.” It is worthily said; but if the notes are as sonorous as\r\nthis, what must be the rumble of the text?\r\n\r\nDean Gaisford, as we have said, continued Jackson’s educational\r\nmethod ably and faithfully; and his view that pass-work should be\r\ndone entirely in College, and Colleges be made responsible for it,\r\nmay well find advocates now. All men respected the stout old scholar,\r\nand had in most things to own the shrewdness, and particularly the\r\njustice, of his judgment. The piquancy of many anecdotes and sketches\r\nof him has departed with the generation who honoured him as the first\r\nGreek scholar of England in his time. He too felt his high position\r\nsufficient, and had real happiness in efficient discharge of its\r\nduties, which were thoroughly well suited to him; and he had perhaps a\r\nbetter understanding of the nature and ways of his undergraduates than\r\nmany younger and less outwardly formidable seniors.\r\n\r\nTwo more great names, as of a father and son, so faithfully did the\r\nyounger reflect the mind and second the purposes of the elder, must\r\nof right find mention here;--not due honour, since that would involve\r\nthe whole history of the Oxford Movement, both earlier and later.\r\nIt is hoped that the late Dr. Liddon’s Life of Dr. Pusey is so far\r\nadvanced, or its material is so well ordered and prepared, that it may\r\nsoon appear--as a monument to two great English Doctors. The elder\r\nentered at Christ Church in 1819, and returned as Canon in 1828, after\r\nhaving been Fellow of Oriel College; the younger matriculated at the\r\nHouse in 1846. Dr. Barnes, then Sub-Dean, made Henry Parry Liddon\r\nStudent in 1846. From thenceforth Pusey had one near him like-minded:\r\nnot in the obsequious mimicry of imitation which has produced so many\r\npseudo-Newmans, but in true following of one Master, in intelligent\r\napprehension of and devotion to the principles of the Catholic Church\r\nof England, and in self-denying holiness of life. Many friendships for\r\nlife date from Christ Church, but this has excelled them all: and these\r\ntwo rest from their labours.\r\n\r\nSome brief account of the latest buildings and restorations, on which\r\nthe fine taste of Dean Liddell has left its mark, seems desirable here.\r\nThe new buildings, before-mentioned (p. 309), are by Mr. Thomas Deane,\r\nson of Sir T. N. Deane. They consist of six staircases, containing\r\nforty-three sets of students’ chambers of three rooms each, and ten\r\nchaplains’ or tutors’ rooms of four apartments and upwards. The front\r\ntowards the Meadow is partly masked by the trees of the old Broad\r\nWalk (planted by Dean Fell in Feb. 1670) and the other avenue to the\r\nriver. The roof is continuous on the meadow front, but there are\r\ngables towards the quadrangle. The roof-supports rest on corbels, and\r\nthe beam-ends are free. The whole is 331 feet long and 37 deep. The\r\nstone walls are carried through to the roof between the staircases\r\nand lined with brickwork. The style is a variety of Italian Gothic,\r\nmassively built, story upon story, with good pointed arches, but not\r\nin any Northern or regularly “arcuated” style. But the ornament is all\r\nbeautiful flower-work, and by the artist-workmen whom Messrs. Woodward\r\nand Dean gathered round them, whom Prof. Ruskin himself educated in the\r\nthen Working-Man’s College. In as far as that teaching has succeeded,\r\na share of the honour is due to Christ Church, through that son of\r\nhers who has done her highest and most honour in the literature of the\r\ncentury, and whose name will for ever be a call to all artists who love\r\nhonour and their work.[261]\r\n\r\nA recent Oxford Almanac represents the Interior of the Cathedral as\r\nit appeared in 1876, before the new woodwork of the Choir and the\r\nReredos. Both were needed, and both are beautiful in their way; but\r\nthe reredos has the fault or misfortune of the new one in St. Paul’s,\r\nLondon--nothing can make it look like part of the structure. The rich\r\ndepth of tint and carven gloom are fine. Still the general effect of\r\nthe Cathedral, with its bright windows and warm stone-tints, is rather\r\none of lightness and pleasant colour, like pages of a Missal, as Ruskin\r\nsays of St. Mark’s. The new glass by Morris and Faulkner, after Burne\r\nJones, is decidedly beyond any praise we have room to give it here: the\r\ngreat North Transept window glows with all the fires which a fervid\r\nfancy can bestow on the inwards of the Dragon. Clayton and Bell’s\r\nwindows are beautiful in crimson and white; and all we can say of\r\nJonah’s dear old gourd is that we hope its shadow may now never be less.\r\n\r\nThere are some works of art of considerable interest in the Library,\r\namidst a number of no particular value. On the right of the door, the\r\nNativity of Titian was certainly a part of Charles I.’s collection,\r\nand is probably an original, though it reminds one of Bonifazio. There\r\nis a portrait of A. Vezale by Tintoret; and a small head attributed\r\nto Holbein, of the greatest beauty. We cannot feel sure about the\r\nJohn Bellini Madonna; but the Piero della Francesca Madonna with\r\nAngels is beautiful and interesting. There are four very authentic\r\nMantegnas, one of which (No. 59, Christ bearing the Cross) certainly\r\nbelonged to Charles I. The possible Giorgione of Diana and her Nymphs\r\nis worth attention; and there is a genuine-looking Veronese, with his\r\nbeautiful striped silk drapery, of the Marriage of St. Catherine. Two\r\ngood portraits and the unfinished man-at-arms by Vandyke, with the\r\nadmirable brush-work in white on the horse, are in the east room on the\r\nother side of the great door, and complete our list of the more modern\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nThe more ancient Italian schools, from the semi-Byzantine Margheritone\r\nto Taddeo Gaddi and the Giotteschi, are well represented at the western\r\nend of the lower floor of the Library. Margheritone is said, in the\r\nnotes to Mrs. Browning’s _Casa Guidi Windows_, to have died of disgust\r\n(“infastidito”) at the successes of the new, Italian or Cimabue,\r\nschool; and she remarks that\r\n\r\n    “Strong Cimabue bore up well\r\n    Against Giotto.”\r\n\r\nIt is most satisfactory to have original works by all these three.\r\nThe Margheritone is a thoroughly Byzantine saint, with a gold\r\nbackground and an expression certainly best characterized by the word\r\n“infastidito.” Next comes the Cimabue triptych: its central Madonna has\r\nsome resemblance to the Borgo Allegri picture on a small scale. The\r\nGiottos show some such advance of art in his hands as Dante described.\r\nThere is an apparently genuine Filippo Lippi, which must be of no small\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe drawings are most beautiful. The small Lionardo head and the large\r\nMadonna are unmistakable and beyond praise, and may be contrasted\r\nwith a singularly beautiful head which displays his taste for\r\n“monsters,” and the portrait of Ludovico Sforza is excellent. There\r\nare two drawings by Masaccio, and the Titian Landscapes are capital.\r\nThe visitor should not miss the red chalk head attributed to Gentile\r\nBellini, we suppose rightly: it is hard to say who else, except his\r\nson, could have done it.\r\n\r\nTo give an account of the portraits in the Hall would set us adrift on\r\ngeneral history. Locke and the Marquis of Wellesley, the two Sir Joshua\r\nbishops, Cyril Jackson looking forth at a world he knew the worth\r\nof, Wolsey and Henry VIII.--founders, crowned heads, members of the\r\nfoundation--survey the College dinner like guests departed. They are\r\nforgotten, or their remembrance is like his that tarrieth but a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note on the Date of the Cathedral._\r\n\r\nMr. J. Park Harrison has most kindly enabled me to give his conclusions\r\non the dates of the cathedral in his own words. Having inspected the\r\nbuilding with him, I entirely adhere to them. I think they are fully\r\nborne out by the remains of the old building, and scarcely to be got\r\nover when one has seen the joints and ornamentation inside, and the\r\nfoundations without.\r\n\r\n1. “The commonly-assigned date of the cathedral, 1160-1180, is\r\nabsolutely incorrect.\r\n\r\n2. “The late Norman work, attributed with much probability to Prior\r\nRobert of Cricklade, is an addition to the old church restored by\r\nGuimond in the earlier part of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n3. “There is no document, or anything tending to show that the original\r\nfabric, as restored by Ethelred, was ever rebuilt on a new plan.\r\n\r\n4. “Several of the choir capitals differ essentially in their\r\nornamentation from any others in the cathedral; but resemble very\r\nclosely the ornamental work in illuminated MSS. of Ethelred’s time.\r\nThey[262] should consequently belong to the church as enlarged by him\r\nin 1004.\r\n\r\n5. “The east wall of the ‘ecclesiola’ built by Didanus in the eighth\r\ncentury still exists, with two arches once communicating with apses,\r\nwhose foundations have been discovered about two feet below the ground,\r\nwith a third midway between them.”\r\n\r\nThe junction of the eleventh century, or Ethelred’s, work with the\r\ntwelfth century, or Norman, is clearly visible at the north and\r\nsouth-west corners of the choir, and the abaci though resembling each\r\nother are of different thickness. The ashlar work is different, and the\r\ncourses are not continuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nTRINITY COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. HERBERT E. D. BLAKISTON, M.A., FELLOW OF TRINITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity in the University of\r\nOxford of the Foundation of Sir Thomas Pope, Knt., commonly called\r\nTrinity College,” is one of the first instances of the attempt to endow\r\nlearning out of the funds thrown into private hands by the suppression\r\nof the monasteries. It was founded during the period of reaction, and\r\nits statutes may be characterised as transitional. Its numbers and\r\nendowments have never entitled it to rank with the larger foundations,\r\nbut the vigorous character of various members of the College has saved\r\nit from obscurity. It has some mediæval associations, through its\r\ninformal connexion with the older Durham College, on the vacant site\r\nof which it was established: for some years Trinity drew on the same\r\ncounties, still preserves in part the old buildings, and has lately\r\nsupplied several officers to the modern University of Durham. A short\r\nsketch of the history of Durham College should properly precede that of\r\nTrinity.\r\n\r\nDURHAM COLLEGE was originally a hall for the accommodation of students\r\nfrom Durham Abbey who had come to Oxford to obtain better teaching\r\nthan they could find in the cloister, even before the Benedictine\r\nConstitutions of 1337, which provided that each convent should maintain\r\nat some place of higher study one in twenty of their numbers. Monastic\r\nauthorities did not like the young monks to live in lodgings with\r\nthe secular students, and they were originally sent in the case of\r\nCistercians to Rewley, and of Augustinians to St. Frideswide’s.\r\nThe Benedictines had houses at Reading and Abingdon, but none at\r\nOxford; and when Walter of Merton invented the collegiate system,\r\nthe Benedictines of Gloucester imitated him by the foundation of\r\nGloucester College in 1283, which was enlarged by hostels, built after\r\na general chapter at Abingdon, for such influential abbeys as Norwich,\r\nGlastonbury, and St. Alban’s; but the rich society at Durham, probably\r\nfrom the traditional hostility between North and South, stood aloof;\r\nwhile Canterbury established a separate “nursery” in 1363, and Croyland\r\nand others sent their students to Cambridge, and eventually founded\r\nBuckingham College, now Magdalene.\r\n\r\nThe Durham chronicler says that Hugh of Darlington (Prior of Durham\r\n1258-72 and 1285-89) hated Richard of Houghton, who was a young man\r\nof grace, and therefore sent the monks to study at Oxford, “et eis\r\nsatis laute impensas ministrabat.” Richard, sometime Prior of Lytham,\r\nmay have been the “master of the novices”; he became Prior in 1289,\r\nand obtained leave to build on a site between Horsemonger Street or\r\nCanditch (Broad St.) and the King’s Highway of Beaumont (Park St.),\r\nalready acquired from St. Frideswide’s, Godstow, and other grantors. Of\r\nthe original buildings, presumably unmethodical in plan, some remains\r\nmay survive in the lower part of the hall, and the adjoining buttery\r\nand bursary. A chapel was contemplated in 1326, but not erected till a\r\ncentury later; the present common-room may have been used as an oratory\r\nmeanwhile.\r\n\r\nThere was no endowment at first, but the Convent maintained six to ten\r\nmonks as early as 1300; in 1309 they sent the second of two gifts or\r\nloans of books; a John of Beverley is called “Prior Oxoniae” in 1333.\r\nIn a deed of 1338, Edward III. announces that, in fulfilment of a vow\r\nmade at Halidon Hill to God and St. Margaret, he surrenders to Richard\r\nof Bury, Bishop of Durham, the valuable rectory of Symondburne (the\r\ntitle to which they were then disputing) to endow a prior and twelve\r\nmonks from Durham on the site in the suburbs of Oxford, with a church\r\nand lodgings to be erected at his expense; but this plan of endowment\r\nwas never carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, however, did not forget his project, and left to the\r\nCollege at his death the library, immense for the time, which his\r\nposition as courtier, prelate, ambassador, and Chancellor had enabled\r\nhim to amass, till he had more books, in his bedroom and elsewhere,\r\n“than all the bishops in England had then in their keeping.” His\r\nintention is recorded in the famous _Philobiblon_. It has been stated\r\nthat the collection was sold by the Bishop’s executors to pay his\r\ndebts; but besides indirect evidence, there is the statement of\r\nDr. T. Cay (Master of University 1561) that he saw _in bibliotheca\r\nAungervilliana_ a MS. of the treatise, supposed to be the autograph.\r\nThe Library retains in its windows the arms of the older society and\r\nits benefactors, and effigies of the saints of the Order, etc.; but\r\nthe books, with Bishop Langley’s _Augustine on the Psalms_ in three\r\nvols., and other additions, disappeared at the Reformation. They cannot\r\nbe traced to Balliol or Duke Humphrey’s library; so perhaps they were\r\namong the purchases made by Archbishop Parker from Dr. G. Owen, or they\r\nmay have been secured for the Durham Chapter by the first Dean and\r\nthe first senior Canon, previously Prior of Durham and Warden of the\r\nCollege in Oxford respectively.\r\n\r\nThe next Bishop, Thomas of Hatfield, a secular clerk of good family,\r\ngreat military capacity (he was one of the commanders at Nevill’s\r\nCross) and architectural taste, and tutor to the Black Prince, was\r\nstimulated by the examples of Islip (Canterbury College) and Wykeham\r\nto endow the Durham Hall permanently; his charter still exists in the\r\nform of a contract with the prior and convent, executed in 1380. Four\r\ntrustees (including William Walworth Lord Mayor, and Master Uthred a\r\nmonk of Durham, who was soon afterwards tried for heresy) will furnish\r\nmoney to purchase property worth two hundred marks a year, to maintain\r\na warden and seven other student monks, under rules closely resembling\r\nthose of a Benedictine cell, and also (which is a new departure)\r\neight secular students in Grammar and Philosophy at five marks each,\r\nfrom Durham and North Yorkshire, on the nomination of the prior, who\r\nare to dine and sleep apart from the monks, and perform any _honesta\r\nministeria_ that do not interfere with their studies. These are under\r\nno obligation to take orders or vows; but must take an oath to further\r\nthe interests of the Church of Durham.\r\n\r\nNo buildings are mentioned, but probably the north and east sides of\r\nthe original quadrangle containing library, warden’s lodging, and\r\nrooms, had been built _c._ 1350. Hatfield died in 1381; the convent\r\npurchased from John Lord Nevill of Raby and appropriated the churches\r\nof Frampton (Linc.), Fishlake and Bossall (Yorks), and Roddington\r\n(Notts), giving for them £1080 and two other churches. The revenue\r\nwas two hundred and sixty marks. Many of the bursarial rolls sent\r\nto Durham between 1399 and 1496 are preserved there. But the income\r\nsoon declined; and even after the convent had added the church of\r\nBrantingham, there was generally a deficit.\r\n\r\nLittle further is known: Bishops Skirlaw and Langley left legacies, as\r\ndid probably members of the families of Mortimer, Nevill, Kemp, Grey,\r\nArundell, and Vernon. Several Wardens became Priors of Durham: Gilbert\r\nKymer, physician to Duke Humphrey, and ten years Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, lived in the College. The Priors regulated the College from\r\ntime to time; in a letter of 1467 some strong language is addressed\r\nto a fellow who had indulged in riotous living till “vix superest\r\noperimentum corporis et grabati.”\r\n\r\nThe College, though in part a secular foundation, fell with the Abbey,\r\nsurrendered by Hugh Whitehead in 1540. In Henry VIII.’s valuation its\r\nincome was £115 4_s._ 4_d._ (warden £22, fellows £8, scholars 4 marks,\r\neach), and it owned a sanatorium at Handborough. Out of the estates\r\nconfiscated a school was endowed, as well as the Durham Chapter; a\r\nlarger scheme which provided for branches at Oxford and Cambridge\r\nfell through. In 1545 the site of the College reverted to the Crown;\r\nthe part occupied by the Cistercian Bernard College passed to Christ\r\nChurch, and is now part of St. John’s College garden. In 1553, W.\r\nMartyn and George Owen, physician to Henry VIII. and his successors,\r\nand the grantee of Godstow nunnery, received the rest of the “backside”\r\nwith the buildings, which were by that time mere _canilia lustra_\r\n(dog-kennels), though they had been used by Dr. W. Wright, Archdeacon\r\nof Oxford, Vice-Chancellor 1547-9, as a private hall. The site was then\r\nsold to Sir T. Pope, Owen transferring to his own estates a quit-rent\r\nof 26_s._ 2_d._ due to the Crown. In 1622, Trinity had to pay some\r\narrears of this, which they recovered from Owen’s heirs, and settled\r\nthe matter by the aid of Sir George Calvert, a Trinity man, then\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS POPE appears to have belonged to the class of Tudor\r\nstatesmen of which More, Fisher, and Wolsey are representative, who,\r\nwhile personally attached to the traditional ideas in religious\r\nmatters, did not oppose all reform; and were anxious that the revival\r\nof learning should be assisted by part at least of the funds justly\r\ntaken from the monasteries, according to the precedent set by Wykeham,\r\nChichele, and Waynflete. He was born _c._ 1508, at Deddington, and\r\nwas the eldest son of a small landowner. After being educated at\r\nBanbury and Eton, he studied law with success. He held various offices\r\nin the Star-Chamber, Chancery, and the Mint, from 1533 to 1536, in\r\nwhich year he became Treasurer of the new and important Court of\r\nAugmentations, which dealt with monastic property. After five years he\r\nwas succeeded by Sir Edward North, in whose family his own was merged\r\nin the next century. He obtained a grant of the arms still borne by\r\nhis College; and was knighted in 1536 with the poet-Earl of Surrey.\r\nIn 1546 he became Master of the Woods, etc. South of Trent, and was a\r\nprivy councillor. He did not personally receive the surrender of any\r\nreligious house except St. Alban’s, where he saved the abbey church;\r\nbut he probably had exceptional opportunities of acquiring abbey\r\nlands. The Abbess of Godstow, where his sister was a nun, claims his\r\nprotection in some letters still extant. Among his intimate friends\r\nwere Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor Audley, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Sir\r\nThomas Whyte, Lord Williams of Thame, Bishop Whyte of Winchester, and\r\nmany of the moderate party of the Humanists.\r\n\r\nUnder Edward VI. he withdrew from public life; but Mary recalled him\r\nto the Privy Council, and employed him on commissions connected with\r\nthe Tower, Wyat’s rebellion, Gresham’s accounts, the suppression of\r\nheresy, etc. In 1555 he had to take charge of the Princess Elizabeth\r\nat Hatfield, and managed to treat her kindly without incurring\r\nsuspicion. Elizabeth took an interest in his project; he writes that\r\n“the princess Elizabeth her grace, whom I serve here, often askyth me\r\nabout the course I have devysed for my scollers: and that part of mine\r\nestatutes respectinge studies I have shown to her, which she likes\r\nwell.” Again, when two of the junior fellows had broken the statute\r\n“de muris noctu non scandendis,” he says “they must openly in the hall\r\nbefore all the felowes and scolers of the collegge, confesse their\r\nfaulte: and besides paye such fyne, as you shall thynke meete, whiche\r\nbeing done, I will the same be recorded yn some boke; wherein I will\r\nhave mencion mayde that for this faulte they were clene expelled the\r\nColl. and at my ladye Elizabeth her graces desier and at my wiffes\r\nrequest they were receyved into the house agayne.” He soon retired\r\nfrom public life, and died probably of a pestilence then epidemic,\r\non January 29th, 1558/9, in the Priory of Clerkenwell, his favourite\r\nresidence. He was buried at St. Stephen’s Walbrook, with his second\r\nwife, Margaret (widow of Sir Ralph Dodmer, Lord Mayor 1529) and his\r\nonly child; in 1567 his third wife Elizabeth Blount (of Blount’s Hall,\r\nStaffs.), widow of Anthony Beresford, removed the bodies to a vault\r\nbeneath the fine tomb with alabaster effigies of her husband and\r\nherself, which she erected in Trinity chapel. A contemporary writer\r\nrecords the magnificence of the funeral, “and aftyr to the playse to\r\ndrynke with spyse-brede and wyne. And the morow masse iii songes, with\r\nii pryke songes, and the iii of Requiem, with the clarkes of London.\r\nAnd after, he was beried: and that done, to the playse to dener; for\r\nther was a grett dener, and plenty of all thynges, and a grett doll\r\nof money.” In a will, dated 1556, besides large sums to the poor,\r\nprisoners, and churches, he bequeaths money for specified purposes to\r\nTrinity with a quantity of plate, rings and various articles to his\r\nfriends, _e. g._ his “dragon-whistle,” and his “black satten gowne with\r\nluserne-spots” (both seen in his portraits) to Sir N. Bacon and “Master\r\nCroke, my old master’s son,” considerable legacies to his relations,\r\nand the residue of his goods to his wife. His estates had been already\r\nsettled; Tyttenhanger (Herts.), the country house of the abbots of\r\nSt. Alban’s, went to the widow for life, afterwards to her nephew Sir\r\nThomas Pope-Blount (whose mother was Frances Love, daughter of Alice\r\nPope), and eventually through an heiress to the Earls of Hardwicke;\r\nhis brother John Pope received estates in north-west Oxfordshire, but\r\npreferred to settle at Wroxton Abbey, which he and his descendants,\r\nthe Earls of Downe, and their representatives, the Lords North and\r\nEarls of Guildford, have since held on long leases from the College;\r\nother estates passed to his widow, his uncle John Edmondes, and his\r\nnephew Edmund Hutchins. Dame Elizabeth Pope married Sir Hugh Paulet,\r\nK.G., of Hinton St. George, a statesman and soldier of some eminence.\r\nLady Paulet usually nominated to the fellowships, scholarships, and\r\nadvowsons (in one instance after an appeal to the Visitor) till her\r\ndeath in 1593, when she was buried in Trinity chapel with funeral\r\nhonours from the University.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly noticeable that Sir Thomas Pope, having been able\r\nto provide handsomely for his family as well as for his College, did\r\nnot saddle the latter with any of the preferences for founder’s-kin\r\nwhich proved fertile in litigation elsewhere. Indeed he appears to\r\ncontemplate that his heirs will resort to the College as Commoners,\r\nand sets apart the best room for such uses if required. Accordingly we\r\nfind the College constantly receiving besides presents of game, etc.\r\nsubstantial assistance from the Popes, Norths, and others, and sending\r\nthem in return not only the traditional gloves, but money in time of\r\nneed; while the college books record as undergraduates many generations\r\nof the Popes and Pope-Blounts and Norths, and members of families\r\nconnected with them by descent or marriage, such as Brockett, Perrot,\r\nDanvers, Sacheverell, Combe, Greenhill, Poole, Lee (Lichfield), Bertie\r\n(Lindsay), Wentworth (Cleveland), Tyrrell, Legge (Dartmouth), Stuart\r\n(Bute), and Paulet (Poulett).\r\n\r\nOn March 1st, 1554/5, Sir Thomas Pope obtained Royal Letters Patent to\r\nfound TRINITY COLLEGE for a president (a priest), twelve fellows (four\r\npriests), and eight scholars, and a free school (Jesus Scolehouse),\r\nat Hooknorton; and to endow them from his estates enumerated, viz.\r\neighteen manors in north and west Oxfordshire, and eleven elsewhere\r\n(including Bermondsey and Deptford), and fifteen advowsons. On March\r\n28th he gave a “charter of erection,” and admitted in the presence\r\nof the University authorities fourteen or fifteen members of the\r\nfoundation. In May, and subsequently, he furnished them with large\r\nquantities of plate, MSS. and printed books, and “churche stuffe and\r\nplayte,” inventories of which are printed by Warton. Besides the\r\nsilver-gilt chalice and paten, once belonging to St. Albans, we find\r\ncrosses, censers, missals, antiphoners, copes, chasubles, hangings,\r\ncorporas-cases, canopies, tunicles, paxes, banners, a rood and other\r\nimages for the Easter sepulchre, etc., bells, and a pair of organs,\r\nwhich it cost £10 to bring from London. By 1556 he had made a selection\r\nfrom his estates, and gave the College the manors, etc., of Wroxton\r\nand Balscot near Banbury, the rectorial tithe of Great Waltham and\r\nNavestock in Essex, with some farms and rent-charges, all formerly the\r\nproperty of religious houses.\r\n\r\nMost of these estates had been already let on lease for long periods;\r\nand the income from them, minutely apportioned to various purposes by\r\nthe statutes, proved sufficient for the requirements of a sixteenth\r\ncentury college, except as regards the buildings, which were in bad\r\nrepair from the first.\r\n\r\nThe statutes, dated May 1st, 1556, were drawn up by the Founder and\r\nthe first president, Thomas Slythurst, in very fair Latin, for which\r\nArthur Yeldard, one of the fellows, was responsible. They provide\r\nvery detailed rules for the position and conduct of the members of\r\nthe foundation. The president’s duties are mainly disciplinary and\r\nbursarial. The twelve fellows are to study philosophy and theology;\r\nthey are to furnish a vice-president, a dean, two bursars, four\r\nchaplains, a logic or philosophy reader, and a rhetoric or grammar\r\nreader. The eight (afterwards twelve) scholars are to study polite\r\nletters and elementary logic and philosophy; they are to be elected by\r\nthe five College officers after examination in letter-writing, heroic\r\nverse and plain song, being natives of the counties in which College\r\nproperty is situated (Oxford, Essex, Gloucester, and Bedford), or of\r\nthe Founder’s manors, or scholars of Eton or Banbury, or at least\r\nBrackley and Reading; and they must be really in need of assistance.\r\nThey have a prior claim on vacant fellowships. There may be twenty\r\ncommoners of good family, under the care of the fellows. The salaried\r\nservants are the Obsonator, Promus (a poor scholar who is also to act\r\nas Janitor), Archimagirus, Hypomagirus, Barbaetonsor, and Lotrix; the\r\nlast-named is to be above suspicion, but may not enter the quadrangle.\r\nA scholar or fellow is to act as organist, with a small extra stipend.\r\nThere is to be high mass with full services on Sundays and feasts;\r\non week-days mass before six a.m. according to the received forms of\r\nthe “Ecclesia Anglicana,” and the use of Sarum; public and private\r\nprayers for the Founder and his family are prescribed. The Bible\r\nis to be read aloud in hall during the _prandium_ and _cœna_, and\r\nafterwards expounded; after dinner, when the “mantilia longa, et\r\nlavacra, cum gutturniis et aqua” have been used, and the loving cup\r\npassed round, silence is to be observed while the scholars “qui in\r\nrefectionibus ministrant” have their meal, and a declamation is made.\r\nAll public conversation, especially among the scholars, is to be in\r\na learned language. Then follow minute regulations about degrees and\r\ndisputations. Lectures are to be given from six to eight a.m. in\r\narithmetic (from “Gemmephriseus” and Tunstall), geometry (from Euclid),\r\nlogic (from Porphyry, Aristotle, Rodolphus Agricola, and Johannes\r\nCæsarius), and philosophy (Aristotle and Plato); from three to five\r\np.m. on Latin authors, prose and verse alternately, such as Virgil,\r\nHorace, Lucan, Juvenal, Terence, and Plautus, Cicero _de Officiis_,\r\nValerius Maximus, Suetonius, and Florus; and for the more advanced,\r\nPliny’s Natural History, Livy, Cicero’s oratorical works, Quintilian,\r\n“vel aliud hujusmodi excelsum.” It is noticeable that Latin has a\r\ndistinct preference; though Greek is to be taught as far as possible.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Slythurst, Pope writes, “My Lord Cardinall’s Grace\r\n[Pole] has had the overseeinge of my statutes. He much lykes well that\r\nI have therein ordered the Latin tongue to be redde to my schollers.\r\nBut he advyses mee to order the Greeke to be more taught there than I\r\nhave provyded. This purpose I well lyke; but I feare the tymes will\r\nnot bear it now. I remember when I was a yonge scholler at Eton,\r\nthe Greeke tongue was growinge apace; the studie of whiche is now\r\nalate much decaid.” Lectures in the Long Vacation may be on solid\r\ngeometry and astronomy, Laurentius Vallensis, Aulus Gellius, Politian,\r\nor versification; for the shorter vacations declamations and verse\r\nexercises are prescribed. The scholars may not leave the college\r\nprecincts without permission, nor take country walks in parties of\r\nless than three; they may not indulge in “illicitis et noxiis ludis\r\nalearum, cartarum pictarum (_chardes_ vocant), pilarum ad aedes, muros,\r\ntegulas, vel ultra funes jactitarum”; but they may play at “pilæ\r\npalmariae” in the grove, and cards in the hall during “the xii daies”\r\nat Christmastide for “ligulis, lucernis, carta, et hujusmodi vilioris\r\npretii rebus, at pro nummis nullo modo.” No member of the foundation\r\nmay wear fine clothes, or any suit but a “toga talaris usque ad terram\r\ndemissa,” and the hood of his degree; they are to sleep two or three in\r\na room, some in “trochle-beddes”; and they may not carry arms, though\r\nthey are afterwards enjoined to keep in their rooms a “fustis vel\r\naliquod aliud armorum genus bonum et firmum,” to defend the College and\r\nUniversity. Gaudys with extra commons are allowed on twelve festivals;\r\nand at Christmas they may make merry with the six good capons and the\r\nboar “bene saginatus,” provided by two tenants, together with the\r\n“cartlode of fewel,” “wheate and maulte,” due from the president as\r\n_ex-officio_ rector of Garsington. Founder’s-kin are to be preferred\r\nas tenants. Three times a year the statutes are to be read, and once\r\nthe president and one fellow are to hold a scrutiny of the conduct and\r\nprogress of the rest, during which delation appears to be encouraged.\r\nThe chief penalties to enforce these rules are impositions and loss of\r\ncommons, with expulsion on the third repetition of a minor offence; the\r\nviolation of some statutes involves summary deprivation; scholars under\r\ntwenty may be birched or caned by the dean. The statutes conclude, and\r\nare pervaded with, exhortations to unity and fidelity. When we take\r\ninto account the fact that except in special cases the limit of absence\r\nwas forty days in the year for a fellow and twenty for a scholar, it is\r\nclear that the life contemplated was one of almost monastic strictness\r\nin matters of detail.\r\n\r\nA postscript dated 1557 adds to the revenues to increase certain\r\nallowances, and provides five obits, one on Jesus-day (Aug. 7th) for\r\nthe Founder, with doles for the poor and the prisoners in the Castle\r\nand Bocardo. A design for building a house at Garsington, as a place\r\nof retreat for the College in times of the pestilences then common,\r\nis mentioned; a quadrangular building built with five hundred marks\r\nleft by the Founder, and help from his widow, was finished about 1570.\r\nThe College removed there bodily in 1577; we find payments for “black\r\nbylles” for protection there, food at Abingdon, Woodstock, etc.,\r\nantidotes for those left behind, carts for the carriage of kitchen\r\nutensils, books, and surplices, and the clock. In 1563/4 they had\r\nretired to lodgings in Woodstock.\r\n\r\nThe annual computus commences on Lady Day, 1556. On Trinity Sunday the\r\nFounder formally admitted the president, twelve fellows, and seven\r\nscholars in the chapel. In July he came again with Bishops Whyte\r\n(Winchester) and Thirlby (Ely), and others. The president held his\r\nstirrup, the vice-president made an oration “satis longam et officii\r\nplenam,” and the bursars offered “chirothecas aurifrigiatas.” The\r\nbanquet in the hall and the twelve minstrels cost £12 3_s._ 9_d._ The\r\npresident celebrated “missam vespertinam” in the best cope, and Sir\r\nThomas “obtulit unam bursam plenam angelorum.” After service he gave\r\nthe bursars the whole of their expenses and a silver-gilt cup from\r\nwhich he had drunk to the company in “hypocrasse,” and a mark each\r\nto the scholars. The accounts record many other visits from him and\r\nhis wife and their influential friends, gifts of timber and game, and\r\npresents of gloves in return.\r\n\r\nDr. Thos. Slythurst was a canon of Windsor, and held several benefices,\r\nchiefly by court favour; the original fellows came from other\r\nfoundations, especially Queen’s and Exeter. Yeldard was a fellow of\r\nPembroke, Cambridge, and had been educated in Durham Convent. The\r\nscholars were mainly from the Midlands, and afterwards usually natives\r\nof the preferred counties, with Bucks and Herts; two or three were\r\nelected annually, with one or two fellows; till 1600 the tenure of\r\na fellowship rarely exceeds ten years. In 1564/5 there were already\r\nseventeen commoners, and from the caution-books it seems that from\r\nfifteen to thirty were admitted annually, and resided for two or\r\nthree years. There were two or three grades, and some instances are\r\nfound of private servants or tutors; and of the residence for short\r\nperiods of persons not _in statu pupillari_. At first several Durham\r\nand Yorkshire names occur, as Claxton, Conyers, Lascelles, Blakiston,\r\nShafton, Trentham; and Edward Hindmer (sch. 1561) was probably son\r\nof the last warden of Durham College; afterwards the families of the\r\nsouthern Midlands are largely represented, and Fettiplaces, Lenthails,\r\nChamberlains, Newdigates, Annesleys, Bagots, Fleetwoods, Lucys,\r\nChetwoods, Hobys, etc. abound.\r\n\r\nThe early years of the College were uneventful except for two\r\nvisitations in the interests of the reformed religion. In 1560 several\r\nof the fellows retired; Slythurst was deprived, and died in the Tower.\r\nNo objection appears to have been offered by the Foundress to the\r\nenforced disregard of many explicit regulations in the statutes: the\r\n“sacerdotes missas celebrantes” became “capellani preces celebrantes”;\r\nbut incense was sometimes bought, and the feasts of the Assumption and\r\nSt. Thomas à Becket kept as gaudys. It is noticeable that an English\r\nBible and two Latin “Common Prayer” books had been sent with the\r\nFounder’s service-books. In 1570 Bishop Horne ordered the destruction\r\nor secularisation of the Founder’s presents as “monuments tending to\r\nidolatrie and popish or devill’s service, crosses, censars, and such\r\nlyke fylthie stuffe”; several of the Romanising fellows retired to\r\nGloucester Hall and Hart Hall (one was executed at York as a popish\r\npriest in 1600; another was George Blackwell, the “archpriest”). A\r\ntable took the place of the three altars, but the paintings and glass\r\nremained. “In 1642, the Lord Viscount Say and Seale came to visit the\r\nCollege, to see what of new Popery they could discover. My L.^{d} saw\r\nthat this” (the painting) “was done of old time, and Dr. Kettle told\r\nhis Lo.^{p}, ‘Truly we regard it no more than a dirty dish-clout,’ so it\r\nremained untoucht till Harris’s time, and then was coloured over with\r\ngreen”; much to the disgust of Aubrey.\r\n\r\nYeldard, a writer of some academic reputation, became president; but\r\nthe computus, during his thirty-nine years of office, records nothing\r\nmore exciting than journeys to the estates, and small repairs to the\r\nold buildings. In his time the foundation included Thomas Allen, Henry\r\nCuffe, who was expelled for remarking to his host when dining at\r\nanother college, “A pox _this_ is a beggarly college indeed--the plate\r\nthat our Founder stole would build another as good” (he became fellow\r\nof Merton and Regius Professor of Greek, and was executed after Essex’s\r\nrebellion), Thomas Lodge the dramatist, Richard Blount the Jesuit,\r\nBishops Wright of Lichfield and Coventry, Adams of Limerick, and\r\n(according to Wood) Smith of Chalcedon _in partibus_; among commoners\r\nwere Sir Edward Hoby, John Lord Paulett, and Sir George Calvert, first\r\nLord Baltimore.\r\n\r\nYeldard was succeeded in 1598/9 by Dr. Ralph Kettell, of Kings-Langley,\r\nscholar on the nomination of the Foundress in 1579. Though not a man\r\nof mark outside Oxford, he seems to have initiated the development of\r\nthe College in the seventeenth century. He personally supervised every\r\ndepartment of college life, and left in his curious sloping handwriting\r\nfull memoranda of lawsuits and special expenses, lists of members,\r\nand copies of deeds. By husbanding the resources of the College, he\r\nrestored extensively the old Durham quadrangle, superimposing attics\r\nor “cock-lofts,” rebuilding the hall, and erecting on the site of\r\n“Perilous Hall,” then leased from Oriel, the handsome house which bears\r\nhis name. He was a “right Church of England man,” and disliked Laud’s\r\ndespotic reforms. When an old man he became very eccentric, if we may\r\nbelieve John Aubrey (commoner 1642), who saw him as he is painted with\r\n“a fresh ruddie complexion--a very tall well-grown man. His gowne and\r\nsurplice and hood being on, he had a terrible gigantique aspect, with\r\nhis sharp gray eies. The ordinary gowne he wore was a russet cloth\r\ngowne--He spake with a squeaking voice--He dragged with his right foot\r\na little, by which he gave warning (like the rattle-snake) of his\r\ncomeing. Will. Egerton would go so like him that sometimes he would\r\nmake the whole chapel rise up.” “When he observed the scholars’ haire\r\nlonger than ordinary, he would bring a paire of cizers in his muffe\r\n(which he commonly wore), and woe be to them that sate on the outside\r\nof the table. I remember he cutt Mr. Radford’s haire with the knife\r\nthat chipps the bread on the buttery-hatch, and then he sang, ‘_And was\r\nnot Grim the Collier finely trimmed?_’” The whole of Aubrey’s remarks\r\non him and other Trinity men is good reading, and we may conclude with\r\nan anecdote which is at once suggestive of, and a contrast with, a\r\nchapter in _John Inglesant_.\r\n\r\n“’Tis probable this venerable Dr. might have lived some yeares longer,\r\nand finish’t his century, had not the civill warres come on; w^{ch}\r\nmuch grieved him, that was absolute in the Colledge, to be affronted\r\nand disrespected by rude soldiers. I remember, being at the Rhetorique\r\nlecture in the hall, a foot-soldier came in and brake his hower-glasse.\r\nThe Dr. indeed was just stept out, but Jack Dowch pointed at it. Our\r\ngrove was the Daphne for the ladies and their gallants to walk in,\r\nand many times my Lady Isabella Thynne would make her entrys with a\r\ntheorbo or lute played before her. … She was most beautiful, humble,\r\ncharitable, &c., but she could not subdue one thing. I remember\r\none time this Lady and fine M^{ris} Fenshawe (she was wont, and my\r\nLady Thynne, to come to our chapell, mornings, halfe dressed like\r\nangells) would have a frolick to make a visit to the President. The\r\nold Dr. quickly perceived that they came to abuse him; he addressed\r\nhis discourse to M^{ris} Fenshawe, saying, ‘Madam, your husband and\r\nfather I bred up here, & I knew your grandfather; I know you to be a\r\ngentlewoman, I will not say you are a whore, but gett you gonne for a\r\nvery woman.’ The dissoluteness of the times, as I have sayd, grieving\r\nthe good old Dr., his days were shortned, & dyed” in July 1643.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Trinity produced among Bishops, Glemham of St. Asaph’s,\r\nLucy of St. David’s, Ironside of Bristol, Skinner of Bristol, Oxford,\r\nand Worcester, Gore of Waterford, Parker of Oxford, Stratford of\r\nChester, and Sheldon of Canterbury; among authors, Sir John Denham,\r\nWilliam Chillingworth, Ant. Faringdon, Arthur Wilson, Daniel Whitby,\r\nSir Edw. Byshe, Francis Potter, Henry Gellibrand, George Roberts, M.D.,\r\nand James Harrington; among Cavalier leaders, Thomas Lord Wentworth,\r\ncreated Earl of Cleveland, Sir Philip Musgrave of Edenhall, and Sir\r\nHervey Bagot; on the other side, Henry Ireton and Edmund Ludlow;\r\nbesides the chivalrous William Earl of Craven, and John Lord Craven of\r\nRyton, founder of the Craven scholarships, Cecil Calvert second Lord\r\nBaltimore, Sir Henry Blount the traveller, Milton’s friend Charles\r\nDeodate, Dr. Nathaniel Highmore, and Chief Justice Newdigate.\r\n\r\nThe next president, Hannibal Potter, was elected during the disorders\r\nof the Civil War. The college buildings were occupied during the siege\r\nof Oxford by the courtiers and officers; many of the undergraduates\r\nenlisted; the register and accounts are defective; the elections were\r\nirregular, and the number of commoners admitted dropped from thirty-two\r\nin 1633 to four in 1643, none in 1644, and one in 1645, reviving to\r\ntwenty-one in 1646. The tenants fell behind with their rents, and\r\nin 1647 the arrears from estates and battels amounted to £1385; in\r\nNovember 1642 the King “borrowed” £200, and in the following March\r\nSir Wm. Parkhurst gave the College a receipt for 173 pounds of plate,\r\nwhich included everything given by the Founder and others, except\r\nthe chalice, paten, and two flagons. In 1647 and 1648 the College\r\nsent £145 13_s._ 4_d._ and £45 to the Earl of Downe and his uncle Sir\r\nThomas Pope. In 1647 a lessee of College property, Sir Robert Napier of\r\nLuton-Hoo, deposited £160 for emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn 1648 the members of the College were cited before the Puritan\r\nVisitors of the University; eventually twenty-six submitted and\r\nnineteen were ejected; some of them never appeared, _e. g._ the bursar\r\nJosias Howe, who had carried off many of the College documents into\r\nthe country. Nine persons were intruded by the Visitors at different\r\ntimes. Potter, who, as acting Vice-Chancellor, had for some time\r\nbaffled the commissioners, was turned out of his house by Lord Pembroke\r\nin person, to make room for one of the Visitors, Dr. Robert Harris, of\r\nMagdalen Hall. He was an old man, but still vigorous, a good scholar,\r\nan orthodox though popular preacher; and was fairly well received by\r\nthe fellows, some of whom remained without having submitted. Under\r\nhim things settled down, and the numbers rose again; some scandalous\r\nstories were afterwards current of the appropriation of a large sum\r\nleft behind by Potter, and of the exaction from one of the tenants of\r\nan exorbitant fine; but on the whole Harris probably tolerated much of\r\nthe old _régime_, _e. g._ he allowed payments to absent fellows and\r\nthe Founder’s kinsmen, and the old saints’-days were still observed as\r\ngaudys.\r\n\r\nOn his death in 1658, William Hawes was elected, and confirmed by a\r\nmandate from the Protector. In 1659 he resigned on his death-bed in\r\norder that no time might be lost in electing (illegally, since he was\r\nnot a member of the College), Dr. Seth Ward, a deprived fellow of\r\nSydney Sussex, Cambridge, who had settled at Wadham, where he became\r\nSavilian Professor of Astronomy, and one of the founders of the Royal\r\nSociety. He was “very well acquainted and beloved in the College,” and\r\nless likely to be objected to by the Government than Dr. Bathurst, who\r\nwas really the mainstay of the society. In 1660 Ward had to retire on\r\nthe restoration of Potter (with Howe and perhaps a married fellow,\r\nMatthew Skinner), was made Dean and subsequently Bishop of Exeter, on\r\nthe recommendation of the West country gentlemen in the Restoration\r\nParliament, and died Bishop of Salisbury in 1689.\r\n\r\nOn Potter’s death in 1664 Ralph Bathurst naturally became president.\r\nShortly afterwards “A. Wood and his mother and his eldest brother and\r\nhis wife went to the lodgings of Dr. R. B., to welcome him to Oxon, who\r\nhad then very lately brought to Oxon his new-married wife, Mary, the\r\nwiddow of Dr. Jo. Palmer, late Warden of Alls. Coll. which Mary was of\r\nkin to the mother of A. Wood. They had before sent in sack, claret,\r\ncake, and sugar. Dr. Bathurst was then about forty-six years of age,\r\nso there was need of a wife.” He was the fifth son of George Bathurst\r\n(commoner 1605) and Elizabeth Villiers, Kettell’s step-daughter; many\r\nof his family before and after him were at Trinity, and six of his\r\nbrothers are said to have died in the King’s service. He was ordained\r\npriest in 1644; but submitted to the Visitors, “neither owning their\r\nauthority nor concurring in his principles with them, but rather\r\nacting separately from them,” as he said afterwards; studied medicine\r\n(M.D. 1654), and practised in Oxford and as a navy surgeon. During the\r\npersecution of the Church he assisted Bishop Skinner as archdeacon at\r\nthe secret ordinations at Launton and in Trinity chapel. Skinner was\r\nthe only prelate who ordained regularly, and claimed to have conferred\r\norders on 400 to 500 persons. Bathurst was an original F.R.S., and\r\nP.R.S. in 1688; and also a classical scholar of some ability, as\r\nhis remains show. In 1670 he became Dean of Wells, but refused the\r\nbishopric of Bristol, for which Lord Somers recommended him in 1691.\r\n\r\nBathurst was well known in the best society of his day; and\r\nhis reputation, together with the traditions of the families\r\nmentioned above, attracted to Trinity in his time a large number of\r\ngentlemen-commoners of high rank. John Evelyn, for instance, whose\r\nelder brother George was a commoner in 1633, took pains to place\r\nhis eldest son under his care. The University was sinking into the\r\nintellectual torpor of the eighteenth century, and we find few men of\r\nlearning educated at Trinity for 100 years; the best known were Arthur\r\nCharlett the antiquarian, and William Derham, an ingenious writer on\r\nnatural religion. Among the commoners were Lord Chancellor Somers, Wm.\r\nPierrepoint Earl of Kingston, the second Earl of Shaftesbury, Sir Chas.\r\nO’Hara Lord Tyrawley, Commander-in-chief in Ireland, Spencer Compton\r\nEarl of Wilmington (the Prime Minister _faute de mieux_), Allen Earl\r\nBathurst, Cobbe Archbishop of Dublin, and the heads of the families of\r\nAbdy, Broughton, Wallop, Reade, Gresley, Trollope, Shelley, Knollys,\r\nHall, Clopton, Topham, Lennard, Dormer, Napier (of Luton-Hoo), Curzon,\r\nShirley (Ferrers), Herbert (Herbert of Cherbury), Cobb, Bridgeman,\r\nJodrell, Boothby, Jenkinson, and Shaw of Eltham, and many others long\r\nconnected with Trinity.\r\n\r\nIn 1685, some undergraduates, under the command of Philip Bertie,\r\nvolunteered against Monmouth; they drilled in the Grove, and the\r\nCollege paid for the keep of some horses (“Pro avenis in usū Coll.\r\npro equo Mri. Praesidis ad militiā mutuato, 12_s._” Comp. 1685). In\r\nBathurst’s time there appears to have been some connection with the\r\nWest of England, Guernsey, Wales, and South Ireland, and in the next\r\ncentury a large number of entries from the West Indies are found; but\r\non the whole Trinity continued to draw mainly on the southern Midlands,\r\nespecially Oxfordshire and Warwickshire.\r\n\r\nTo receive the increased numbers Bathurst almost rebuilt the college,\r\npartly from the revenues increased by the rise in the value of land,\r\npartly from contributions skilfully extracted from his old pupils and\r\nfriends, and partly from his private means, on which he drew with\r\ngreat liberality. His chief works were the north wing of the garden\r\nquadrangle (nearly the first Palladian work in Oxford) in 1665; the\r\nwest side in 1682, both from Wren’s designs; the Bathurst building,\r\nnow replaced by the new president’s house; the new kitchens, &c.; and\r\nthe present chapel, with the tower and gateway, from Aldrich’s plans\r\ncorrected by Wren, in 1691-4. He spent £2000 on the shell, and the\r\nfittings with the carving by Gibbons were supplied by subscriptions. In\r\nhis time a Fellows’ Common-room, one of the earliest, was instituted,\r\nin the room now the Bursary. Anthony à Wood used to visit it, till his\r\npassion for gossip made him objectionable to the fellows.\r\n\r\nBathurst, whose portrait by Kneller represents him as a clever and\r\nvigorous-looking man, with an oval face and singularly large eyelids,\r\nbecame in his old age “stark blind, deaf, and memory lost.” (“This is a\r\nserious alarm to me,” Evelyn continues after recording his death; “God\r\ngrant that I may profit by it.”) At last, when walking in his front\r\ngarden, from which in his dotage he used to throw stones at Balliol\r\nchapel windows, he fell and broke his thigh, and refusing to have it\r\nset on the ground that “an old man’s bones had no marrow in them,” died\r\nJune 14th, 1704, and was buried in the chapel. His will mentions a\r\nlarge number of legacies to Trinity, Wells, the Royal Society, &c.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century, besides the benefactions by way of\r\nsubscriptions already mentioned, and small gifts of books and plate,\r\nthe College received an endowment for the library from Ric. Rands,\r\nrector of Hartfield, Sussex; a small farm in Oakley and Brill,\r\npurchased with money left by John Whetstone; lands at Thorpe Mandeville\r\nfrom Edward Bathurst, rector of Chipping-Warden; the moiety of the\r\nmanor lands of Abbot’s Langley, Herts, from Francis Combe, great-nephew\r\nof the Founder; and a rent-charge from Thomas Unton, all three for\r\nexhibitions; the livings of Rotherfield-Greys from Thomas Rowney of\r\nOxford, and Oddington-on-Otmoor from Bathurst; and a reading-desk in\r\nthe form of the College crest, a two-headed griffin, from Beckford\r\n“promus.” In the eighteenth century several legacies occur, the most\r\nnoticeable being the livings of Farnham (Essex), Hill-Farrance, and\r\nBarton-on-the-Heath; the Tylney exhibition; several large donations\r\ntowards various schemes connected with the buildings and grounds; the\r\niron gates on Broad Street from Francis North, first Earl of Guildford;\r\nthe clock from Henry Marquis of Worcester and his brother; and a\r\nquantity of plate from fellows and gentlemen-commoners, including a\r\nvery fine ewer and basin from Frederick Lord North and his step-brother\r\nLord Lewisham. Unfortunately the general revenues of the College never\r\nreceived any augmentation, and though they rose with the value of\r\nagricultural produce, are not likely to develop further.\r\n\r\nThe next president was Thos. Sykes, Lady Margaret Professor; but he\r\nhad waited so long for the vacancy that he died in the following year,\r\nand was succeeded by Wm. Dobson, after whose death in 1731 George\r\nHuddesford governed the College for nearly half a century. He was\r\nfollowed by Jos. Chapman (1776-1808) and Thos. Lee (1808-1824). They\r\nall took their doctor’s degree, and were all buried in the chapel; but\r\nthey were not men of any particular distinction, and it is difficult\r\nto individualise them. Huddesford, however, had some reputation as\r\na wit and antiquarian, and his brother William, also at Trinity,\r\nis known as the editor of some important works. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury the foundation of Trinity did no better in producing learned\r\nmen than other Colleges. There were, however, at various dates, a\r\nfew fairly well-known men--Rev. Thomas Warton, M.D., and his better\r\nknown son and namesake, the Professor of Poetry and Laureate; John\r\nGilbert, Archbishop of York; Mant, Bishop of Down and Connor; Wise,\r\nLethieullier, Dallaway, and Ford, antiquarians; James Merrick and Wm.\r\nLisle Bowles, authors. Among commoners were Frederick Lord North, the\r\nPrime Minister, as well as his father and son, his brother Brownlow\r\nBishop of Winchester, and stepbrother William Earl of Dartmouth; the\r\nheads of the Beaufort, Donegal, Umberslade, Hereford, De Clifford,\r\nAshbrook, and Winterton families; William Pitt, the great Earl of\r\nChatham; Johnson’s friends, Bennet Langton and Topham Beauclerk; the\r\nusual number of country baronets, _e. g._ a Northcote, a Cope, a Carew,\r\nand several Shaws, together with members of families long connected\r\nwith Trinity, such as Escott, Borlase, Whorwood, Wheeler, Lingen,\r\nWoodgate, Guille, Sheldon, Norris; and Walter Savage Landor, who had to\r\nbe rusticated for firing a gun into the rooms of another man, whom he\r\nhated for his Toryism, when he was entertaining what Landor called a\r\nparty of “servitors and other raffs of every description.”\r\n\r\nTrinity seems to have been considered a quieter college than others,\r\nif we may believe one G. B., who writes to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_\r\nin 1798, that “at the small excellent College of Trinity were Lord\r\nLewisham, Lord North, Mr. Edwin Stanhope[?] &c., all as regular as\r\n_great Tom_. Of Lord Lewisham and Lord North it was said that they\r\nnever missed early prayers in their College chapel one morning, nor any\r\nevening when not actually out of Oxford, either dining out of town, or\r\non a water-party.” In 1728 the south side of the new quadrangle was\r\nbuilt on the site of the north side of the Durham buildings; the Lime\r\nWalk was planted in 1713, at a cost of £8 19_s._ 3_d._; the hall was\r\ncheaply refitted; but on the whole the College must have presented the\r\nsame homely appearance that it bore up to 1883. The old houses on Broad\r\nStreet, formerly academic halls, were bought from Oriel, and the ground\r\nrecently the President’s kitchen-garden from Magdalen; but no use was\r\nmade of the site till late in the present century.\r\n\r\nThe best known Trinity man in the eighteenth century was Thomas Warton,\r\nwho was intimate with Dr. Johnson and the chief literary men of the\r\ntime. Personally he was a man of retiring character, and undignified\r\nappearance and manners, though he has a pleasant expression in the\r\nportrait by Reynolds. In the Bachelors’ Common-room at Trinity he\r\nfounded the custom of electing annually a Lady-Patroness, and a\r\nPoet-Laureate to celebrate her charms. His poetry has considerable\r\nmerit; he was an indefatigable researcher into English history and\r\nliterature; his _History of English Poetry_ is still reprinted; and\r\nTrinity owes him a heavy debt for the Lives of Sir Thomas Pope and Dr.\r\nBathurst. Dr. Johnson often visited him and stayed at Kettell Hall,\r\nwhere he made the acquaintance of his lively friend, Beauclerk, and\r\nreceived the adoration of Langton. “If I come to live at Oxford,” he\r\nsaid, “I shall take up my abode at Trinity,” and he gave the library in\r\nwhich he preferred to read--(“Sir, if a man has a mind to _prance_, he\r\nmust study at Christchurch and All Souls”)--a copy of the Baskerville\r\nVirgil.\r\n\r\nSome poetical letters, as yet unpublished, by John Skinner,\r\ngreat-great-grandson of the Bishop, contain some particulars of life in\r\nTrinity. He matriculated with a friend from home, one Dawson Warren,\r\non November 16th, 1790; dined with Kett, who gave them wine left to\r\nhim that year by Warton. They lived in Bathurst buildings, had chapel\r\nat 8.0; breakfasted together on tea, rolls, and toast at 8.30; read\r\nDemosthenes for Kett’s lectures, &c., till 1.0. After riding or sailing\r\nin a “yacht” called their Hobby-Horse, they had a hasty shaving and\r\npowdering from the College barber for dinner at 3.0 in “messes” or\r\n“sets.” This concluded with a “narrare” declaimed in hall from the\r\nGriffin. Then they talked till 5.30, when they had a concert with\r\nprofessionals (_e. g._ Dr. Crotch) from the town, concluding with a\r\n“tray” of negus, &c. at 9.30. The less virtuous had a wine; their tray\r\nwas meat and beer; and eventually those of the party who could helped\r\nthe rest to bed. President Chapman was considered good-natured; “Horse”\r\nKett (who wrote several treatises used as text-books, and some poems\r\nand novels which the undergraduates did not appreciate), was respected\r\nbut not liked. Kett’s equine features and pompous bearing figure in a\r\ngood caricature of 1807, “A view from Trinity.”\r\n\r\nBut if the fellows of Trinity as a rule contented themselves with the\r\nroutine well satirised by Warton in the _Rambler_, the ability and\r\nenergy of some of the tutors, particularly Kett, Ingram, Wilson, and\r\nShort, enabled the College to take a leading place in the revival\r\nof Oxford as a place of education at the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The fellow-commoners gradually drop off; among the last\r\nwere Ar. French first Lord De Freyne, and the late Earl of Erne. But\r\nthe scholarships, always virtually open owing to the latitude as to\r\ncounties allowed by the Founder, began to be held by really able\r\nmen, and the elections to them became an honour keenly competed for.\r\nThe number of fellowships was small, and the choice subject to some\r\nlimitations, so that Trinity could not retain all its ablest scholars;\r\nbut it succeeded in retaining their affection. Cardinal Newman for\r\ninstance (admitted as a commoner, 1816; scholar, 1818[?]), had time\r\nto remember his first college at a critical moment of his life; of his\r\nleaving Oxford in 1846 he writes, “I called on Dr. Ogle [the Regius\r\nProfessor of Medicine], one of my very oldest friends, for he was my\r\nprivate tutor when I was an undergraduate. In him I took leave of my\r\nfirst College, Trinity, which was dear to me, and which held on its\r\nfoundation so many who had been kind to me both when I was a boy, and\r\nall through my Oxford life. Trinity had never been unkind to me. There\r\nused to be much snapdragon growing on the walls opposite my freshman’s\r\nroom there, and I had for years taken it as the emblem of my own\r\nperpetual residence even unto death in my University.” Newman was made\r\nan Honorary Fellow in 1878; and in 1885, on sending to the library a\r\nset of his works, wrote, “This May the 18th is the anniversary of the\r\nMonday on which in 1818 I was elected a member of your foundation. May\r\nyour yearly festival ever be as happy a day to you all as in 1818 it\r\nwas to me.”\r\n\r\nAt one time it seemed as if Trinity might take a lead in the Tractarian\r\nmovement; but the influence possibly of Ingram and Haddan directed\r\nthe attention of their pupils to historical studies, at first\r\necclesiastical, but afterwards of a more general character. It is too\r\nearly at present to estimate the exact place of individuals in the\r\nliterature of the nineteenth century; but among those who will be\r\nsaid to have “flourished” since 1800, and by whose work the influence\r\nof Trinity on the period may be judged, may be mentioned the late\r\nArchdeacon Randall, Rev. Isaac Williams the poet and theologian,\r\nRev. W. J. Copeland, J. W. Bowden, Rev. W. H. Guillemard, Sir G. K.\r\nRickards, Rev. A. W. Haddan, the elder Herman Merivale, Mountague\r\nBernard the international jurist, Bishops Claughton of St. Alban’s,\r\nStubbs of Oxford, Basil Jones of St. David’s, and Davidson of\r\nRochester, Vere (Lord) Hobart Governor of Madras, Roundell Palmer Earl\r\nof Selborne, Ralph (Lord) Lingen, Professors Rawlinson, Freeman, Dicey,\r\nSanday, Bryce, Pelham, Ramsay, Rev. Sir G. Cox, Rev. North Pinder, Rev.\r\nIsaac Gregory Smith, Bosworth Smith, the travellers William Gifford\r\nPalgrave and Sir Richard Burton, to omit more junior present and recent\r\nmembers of the foundation and commoners. Some of those mentioned when\r\nscholars were famed for the “Trinity ἦθος,” which denoted “considerable\r\nclassical attainments and certain theological susceptibilities.”\r\n\r\nThe annals of the College during this period can only be glanced at.\r\nDr. James Ingram, president 1824-1850, was well known as one of the\r\nfirst authorities on English antiquities and Anglo-Saxon literature: by\r\nthe undergraduates he was looked upon as what an old pupil has called\r\na “physical force man.” He left to the College a large and valuable\r\ncollection of topographical and antiquarian books. The next president,\r\nDr. John Wilson, of whose great care for the College estates and\r\narchives many striking proofs remain, was one of those Heads of Houses\r\nwho adopted a _non possumus_ attitude towards the first University\r\nCommission; he resigned in 1866, and retired to Woodperry House, where\r\nhe died in 1873. His successor, the Rev. Samuel William Wayte, had\r\nbeen one of the secretaries to the Commissioners; he conferred great\r\nbenefits on the College by his careful management of the property,\r\nand exercised considerable influence in the University. In 1878 he\r\nretired to Clifton, where he still lives. In electing in his place\r\nthe Rev. John Percival, head master of Clifton College, who had never\r\nbeen on the books of Trinity, the fellows took a step unusual but not\r\nunprecedented in College history; in 1887 he resigned, on accepting the\r\nheadmastership of Rugby School. Under Dr. Percival the new statutes\r\nof the Commission of 1877-81 came into force; to them is due a slight\r\nincrease which has taken place in the number of Scholars. The number\r\nof commoners had already exceeded the traditional limit of “forty men\r\nand forty horses,” and partly in consequence of this, it was determined\r\nto build; between 1883 and 1887 the large block of rooms and the\r\nnew president’s lodgings in the front quadrangle, both by Mr. T. G.\r\nJackson, were constructed; Kettell Hall was bought from Oriel, and the\r\npicturesque cottages on Broad Street and the old president’s house\r\nconverted into college rooms. A large portion of the money necessary\r\nfor these purposes was contributed by present and past members of the\r\nfoundation, and other graduates of the College.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude by mentioning some other important benefactions of the\r\npresent century. James Ford, B.D., rector of Navestock, left funds for\r\nthe purchase of advowsons, and for exhibitions appropriated to certain\r\nschools; the Millard bequest provides an endowment for natural science.\r\nA present of money from a “Member of the College” has been spent on\r\nportraits for the hall; an organ for the chapel was given by President\r\nWayte; and seven windows of stained-glass representing Durham College\r\nsaints, have recently been given by the Rev. Henry George Woods, M.A.,\r\nthe present President, to whom this account of Trinity College may be\r\nappropriately inscribed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--It is impossible to form a complete list of the persons educated\r\nat Trinity College, since the first general Register of Admissions\r\ncommences only in 1646, and the entries are not autograph till 1664.\r\nBut an approximate estimate may be made from various records, such as\r\n(1) the Admission Registers A, B, and C, 1646-1891, (2) the formal\r\nadmissions before a notary public of the Scholars or Fellows from 1555,\r\ncontained in the College Registers, (3) the Bursars’ annual account\r\nfrom 1579-1646 of Caution-money paid by Commoners, (4) the University\r\nRegisters, which give some names not contained in the preceding,\r\nprincipally of the “poor scholars” who did not pay Caution-money. The\r\ntotal numbers seem to be not much under 6000, and of this nearly 1000\r\npersons have been members of the foundation.--H. E. D. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nS. JOHN BAPTIST COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. W. H. HUTTON, M.A., FELLOW OF S. JOHN’S.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the dissolution of the religious houses there were in Oxford\r\nnumbers of deserted buildings, little suited for private residences,\r\nbut useful only, as they were designed, for corporate life. Some fell\r\ninto decay, and have now utterly disappeared; others, by the wisdom of\r\nmen interested in the intellectual revival of the age, were refounded\r\nas places of religion, learning, and education. To this latter class\r\nbelongs the College of S. John Baptist. It occupies the site and some\r\nof the buildings of a Bernardine House founded by Archbishop Chichele\r\nin 1437, as a place where the Cistercian scholars studying at Oxford\r\n“might obtain humane and heavenly knowledge.” By Letters Patent of\r\nHenry VI. the Archbishop received leave to “erect a College to the\r\nhonour of the most glorious Virgin Mary and S. Bernard, in the street\r\ncommonly called North Gate street, in the parish of S. Mary Magdalene,\r\nwithout the North Gate.”[263] The buildings consisted only of a single\r\nblock facing westwards, with one wing behind.[264] The hall was built\r\nabout 1502, and the chapel consecrated in 1530. All of these remain in\r\nuse. The monks had also a garden, leased at first part from University\r\nCollege and part from Durham College.\r\n\r\nAt the dissolution in 1539, the lands, buildings, and revenues of S.\r\nBernard’s College were given by Henry VIII. to his newly founded\r\nCollege and Cathedral of Christ Church, in whose possession they\r\nremained some sixteen years. In 1555, the deserted buildings were\r\nrestored to use, and the College refounded under Letters Patent of\r\nPhilip and Mary, granted at the request of a rich and munificent\r\nLondon trader, Sir Thomas White. He was a Merchant Taylor of renown,\r\nwho had been Sheriff of London in 1547, and Lord Mayor in the year of\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt’s rebellion, when he had rallied the citizens to the\r\ncause of Queen Mary. He had, says a College chronicler,[265] poured\r\nover England a torrent of munificence, and now among the many things\r\nin which he deserved well of the State, this was the worthiest. There\r\nis a legend that he was directed in a dream to found a College hard by\r\nwhere three trunks grew from the root of a single elm,[266] and the\r\ntree which was said to have decided him to purchase the buildings of\r\nS. Bernard’s was pointed out as still standing in the garden of Dr.\r\nLevinz, President of S. John’s College from 1673 to 1697. Beyond the\r\nbuildings, there was no link between the old Society and the new. The\r\nCistercian tradition had left no trace; Sir Thomas White’s foundation\r\nwas a new creation.\r\n\r\nThe College thus founded in 1555, was to be set apart[267] for study\r\nof the sciences of Sacred Theology, Philosophy, and good Arts; it was\r\ndedicated to the praise and honour of God, of the Blessed Virgin Mary\r\nHis Mother, and S. John Baptist, and the Society was to consist of a\r\nPresident and thirty graduate or non-graduate scholars. In 1557,[268]\r\nboth the scope and numbers of the original Foundation were enlarged;\r\nTheology, Philosophy, Civil and Canon Law were now declared to be the\r\nsubjects of study, and the number of Fellows and scholars was raised to\r\nfifty, of whom[269] six were to be founder’s kin, two from Coventry,\r\nBristol, and Reading schools, one from Tunbridge and the rest from the\r\nMerchant Taylors’ school in London. Twelve were to study Civil and\r\nCanon Law, one Medicine, and the rest Theology. There were also added\r\nthree priests as chaplains, six clerks not priests yet not married, and\r\nsix choristers. From the first the College was intimately connected\r\nwith the country round Oxford, for the founder endowed it with the\r\nmanors of Long Wittenham, Fyfield, Cumnor, Eaton, Kingston-Bagpuze,\r\nFrilford and Garford, in the counties of Berks and Oxon, and with\r\nsundry advowsons in the neighbourhood. It was at Handborough that the\r\nfirst President, Alexander Belsire, B.D., who was appointed by the\r\nFounder, died. He had been Rector for several years, and had retired\r\nthere when removed from the headship on account of his maintenance of\r\nthe papal supremacy. Several of the earlier Presidents held the living\r\nof Kingston-Bagpuze. In the manor-house at Fyfield the kinsfolk of the\r\nfounder continued to live on for many generations, paying a nominal\r\nrent to the College, which from its piety thus suffered a considerable\r\npecuniary loss at a time when its finances were at a very low ebb.[270]\r\nNearer home, the manor of Walton, which had formerly belonged to the\r\nnunnery of Godstow, gave the College a share in the interests of the\r\ncitizens of Oxford, which has continued to our own time.\r\n\r\nDuring its earlier years Sir Thomas White watched over the institution\r\nwhich he had founded. The statutes which he gave were substantially\r\nthose of New College, and this return to the scheme of William of\r\nWykeham, which had been so largely adopted at Cambridge, shows that\r\nthe alterations made by the founders of Magdalen, Corpus Christi, and\r\nTrinity, were not felt to be improvements. He had nominated the first\r\nPresident, his own kinsman John James as Vice-President for life,\r\nand the earlier Fellows. By his advice probably the second and third\r\nPresidents, and certainly the fourth, were appointed. He drew up also\r\nthe most minute directions for the election and for the binding of the\r\nPresident to the performance of his duties, and for the government\r\nof the College. In all he set himself on behalf of the Society to\r\nseek peace and ensue it. If any strife should arise which could not\r\nwithin five days be appeased by the President and Deans, it must--so\r\nhe ruled--be referred to the Warden of New College, the President of\r\nMagdalen, and the Dean of Christ Church, and by their decision all\r\nmust abide. As he drew towards his end he wrote a touching letter of\r\nfarewell to the Society which lay so near his heart. It runs thus--“Mr.\r\nPresident, with the fellows and scholars, I have me recommended unto\r\nyou from the bottom of my heart, desiring the Holy Ghost may be among\r\nyou until the end of the world, and desiring Almighty God that every\r\none of you may love one another as brethren, and I shall desire you all\r\nto apply your learning, and so doing God shall give you His blessing,\r\nboth in this world and in the world to come. And furthermore if any\r\nstrife or variance do arise among you I shall desire you for God’s love\r\nto pacify it as much as you may, and so doing I put no doubt but God\r\nshall bless every one of you. And this shall be the last letter that\r\never I shall send unto you, and therefore I shall desire every one\r\nof you to take a copy of it for my sake.[271] No more to you at this\r\ntime, but the Lord have you in His keeping until the end of the world.\r\nWritten the 27th of Jan., 1566. I desire you all to pray to God for\r\nme that I may end my life with patience, and that He may take me to\r\nHis mercies. By me, Sir Thomas White, Knight, Alderman of London, and\r\nfounder of S. John Baptist College in Oxford.”\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight from the writing of this letter the founder died.\r\nHe was buried with solemn ceremonial in the College chapel, where his\r\ncoffin was found intact when that of Laud was laid beside it nearly\r\na century later. A funeral oration was preached by one of the most\r\nbrilliant of the junior Fellows, Edmund Campion, soon to win wider\r\nnotoriety, and eventually to die a shameful death.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the founder made more evident the weaknesses with which the\r\nCollege had had to struggle from the first. It was wretchedly poor.\r\nThe munificence of Sir Thomas White himself had more than exhausted\r\nhis purse. He died a poor man; much of what he had intended for the\r\nCollege never reached it,--it would have been less still but for the\r\nscarcely judicial assistance, “partly by pious persuasions and partly\r\nby judicious delays,” of his executor Sir William Cordell, who was\r\nMaster of the Rolls,--and some of the estates, like Fyfield, were\r\nburdened with encumbrances which he had left behind. Nor was this\r\nall. Before the end of the century one of the Bursars seems to have\r\nembezzled the College money and fled, becoming a Papist, and getting\r\nemployment where his antecedents were not known, as paymaster to an\r\nArchduke of Austria. As early as 1577 the expenses had to be cut down;\r\nthe chapel foundation was reduced if not altogether suspended. But the\r\nCollege not only suffered from pecuniary troubles; it seems to have\r\nbeen peculiarly affected by the religious changes of the time. So long\r\nas the founder had lived, his tact had smoothed the difficulties of the\r\ntransition from the Marian to the Elizabethan rule. Two at least of the\r\nearlier Presidents were deprived for asserting the Pope’s supremacy,\r\nyet the change was managed without disturbance. But when the wise\r\ncounsels of the founder could no longer be heard, and when the Papal\r\nCourt had declared itself the bitter foe of Elizabeth, Fellow after\r\nFellow retired, or was deprived, and joined the Roman party. For this\r\ncause no less than six members of the foundation are recorded within a\r\nfew years to have been imprisoned. Some, like Gregory Martin, who had\r\nbeen tutor to the Duke of Norfolk’s children, and was afterwards the\r\ntranslator of the “Rheims Bible,” fled over sea; some died in hiding,\r\nsome in English gaols. One, Edmund Campion, a brilliant orator and a\r\nbold defender of the Papal jurisdiction, became a Jesuit, was mixed up\r\nin several political intrigues, and eventually was hanged at Tyburn. It\r\nmight seem as though the little College, poor and divided, would never\r\nweather the storm. That it did so was no doubt due to the patience and\r\ndevotion of its members. During its darkest years, at the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, there were found philosophers and theologians, such\r\nas Dr. John Case,[272] and skilful administrators such as Dr. Francis\r\nWillis (President, 1577-1590), poets and rhetoricians, and London\r\nmerchants, who gave their talents and their money to support the fame\r\nof the struggling Society.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the sixteenth century the College was on its feet\r\nagain; before a quarter of the century had passed its influence was the\r\nmost important in the University. Great men had begun to send their\r\nsons there. In 1564 came two sons of the Earl of Shrewsbury; in 1572\r\ntwo Stanleys and young Lord Strange. At the accession of James I. few\r\nColleges had among their members so many men already distinguished or\r\nsoon to win distinction. Tobie Matthew, a former President, had risen\r\nto be Dean, and then Bishop, of Durham, and died Archbishop of York.\r\nSir William Paddy, a Fellow and notable benefactor, was the King’s\r\nphysician. John Buckeridge (President, 1605-1611) became Bishop first\r\nof Rochester and then of Ely. A Fellow of the College had been the\r\nMaiden Queen’s ambassador to Russia; many others were famous in the\r\nlaw courts. But two men especially were destined to play a part on a\r\nwider scene. In 1602 William Juxon, a lad of gentle birth, from Sussex,\r\nmatriculated at S. John’s. William Laud, born at Reading on October\r\n7th, 1573, elected a Fellow of S. John’s College at the early age of\r\ntwenty, was Proctor in the year of the King’s accession. From this year\r\nthe history of the College may be considered to be inseparable from\r\nthat of the little energetic personage who left so great a mark upon\r\nthe history of the English Church.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January, 1605, Dr. John Buckeridge was elected President\r\non the death of Ralph Hutchinson. In August of the same year, King\r\nJames visited the University. At the gate of S. John’s “three\r\nyoung youths[273] in habit and attire like nymphs, confronted him,\r\nrepresenting England, Scotland, and Ireland, and talking dialogue-wise\r\neach to other of their state, at last concluding yielding up themselves\r\nto his gracious government. The Scholars stood all on one side of the\r\nstreet; and the strangers of all sorts on the other. The Scholars stood\r\nfirst, then the Bachelors, and last the Masters of Arts.” Two days\r\nafterwards, at the end of a long day, the King saw a comedy, called\r\n_Vertumnuus_, written by Dr. Gwynne, a Fellow of S. John’s. “It was\r\nacted much better than either of the other that he had seen before, yet\r\nthe King was so over-wearied that after a while he distasted it and\r\nfell asleep. When he awaked he would have been gone, saying, ‘I marvel\r\nwhat they think me to be,’ with such other like speeches, showing his\r\ndislike thereof. Yet he did tarry till they had ended it, which was\r\nafter one of the clock.”\r\n\r\nAt this time the University was greatly influenced by Calvinist\r\ndoctrines. It was from S. John’s that the first opposition to the\r\nprevalent opinions came, and it was thus that William Laud first\r\nbecame famous. Laud was ordained deacon and priest by Dr. Young,\r\nBishop of Rochester, who, “finding his study raised above the systems\r\nand opinions of the age, upon the noble foundations of the fathers,\r\ncouncils, and the ecclesiastical historians, early presaged that if\r\nhe lived he would be an instrument of restoring the Church from the\r\nnarrow and private principles of modern times to the more enlarged,\r\nliberal, and public sentiments of the apostolic and primitive ages.”\r\nDr. Young was right in his prophecy, for Laud was soon the leader of\r\nthe reaction against Calvinism in the University, as he was afterwards\r\nsuccessful in asserting more liberal and Catholic sentiments in the\r\nAnglican Church at large. By maintaining in theological lectures and\r\nsermons before the University the doctrine of baptismal regeneration\r\nand the divine institution of Episcopacy, he made himself prominent in\r\nopposition to the chief authorities of the day, who were all imbued\r\nwith Calvinistic views. It was reckoned, so in later years he told\r\nHeylin, a heresy to speak to him, and a suspicion of heresy to salute\r\nhim as he walked in the street. Yet he had no lack of friends; the\r\nmost eminent members of his own College seem always to have stood by\r\nhim,--we have Sir William Paddy’s approval of an University sermon\r\nthat had caused much offence,--and before long he found the whole\r\nUniversity converted to his views. There were sermons and pamphlets\r\nand answers and counterblasts, inquiries by Vice-Chancellor and\r\nDoctors, threats of suspension, murmurs of disloyalty to the Church,\r\nas there have often been since in Oxford theological tempests; but\r\nthe misconception and bitter feeling were gradually overcome by\r\nthe steadfast conscientiousness of Laud. He received a number of\r\npreferments outside the University, was especially honoured by Bishop\r\nNeile of Rochester, and resigned his Fellowship in 1610 to devote\r\nhimself entirely to parochial work. At the end of that year, however,\r\nDr. Buckeridge, President of S. John’s, was elected Bishop of Rochester\r\nin succession to Dr. Neile, and by his advice and support Laud was\r\nproposed for the vacant headship of the College. Calvinist influence\r\nin the University was set to work to induce the King to prevent the\r\nappointment, but without success, and Laud was elected on May 10th,\r\n1611. The election was marked by keen and violent party feeling. When\r\nthe nomination papers had been laid on the altar (as was the custom in\r\nCollege elections down to within living memory), and the Vice-President\r\nwas about to announce the result, one of the Fellows, Richard Baylie,\r\nsnatched the papers from his hands and tore them in pieces. It is\r\ncharacteristic of Laud’s freedom from personal animosity, that he\r\npassed over this act of irritable partisanship and showed special\r\nfavour to the culprit. He procured the choice of Baylie as Proctor\r\nin 1615, afterwards made him his chaplain, married him to his niece,\r\nsupported his election in 1632 to the Presidency itself, and in 1636\r\nappointed him Vice-Chancellor of the University. In the same year,\r\n1611, Laud became one of the King’s chaplains, and from this time was\r\nnot without royal influence to assist him in his University contests.\r\n\r\nHe had still great difficulties to contend with. Dr. Abbot, Regius\r\nProfessor of Divinity and brother of the Primate, preached against\r\nhim in S. Mary’s, his assertion of anti-Calvinistic doctrine, or\r\nArminianism as it was now called, being the cause of complaint.\r\n“Might not Christ say, what art thou? Romish or English, Papist or\r\nProtestant?--or what art thou? A mongrel compound of both; a Protestant\r\nby ordination, a Papist in point of free will, inherent righteousness,\r\nand the like. A Protestant in receiving the Sacrament, a Papist in the\r\ndoctrine of the Sacrament. What, do you think there be two heavens? If\r\nthere be, get you to the other and place yourself there, for into this\r\nwhere I am ye shall not come.” To such coarse stuff as this was Laud\r\ncompelled to listen; he “was fain to sit patiently” among the heads of\r\nhouses, and “hear himself abused almost an hour together, being pointed\r\nat.” But this was merely the vindictive retort of a vanquished party.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 the King sent some instructions to the Vice-Chancellor which\r\nexercised a powerful effect on the theology and discipline of the\r\nUniversity. Care was to be taken that the selected preachers throughout\r\nthe city should conform to the doctrine of the Church, and that\r\nstudents in Divinity should be “excited to bestow their time on the\r\nFathers and Councils, schoolmen, histories and controversies, … making\r\nthem the grounds of their studies in divinity.” In the same year Laud\r\nwas made Dean of Gloucester. In 1621 he became Bishop of S. David’s,\r\nand resigned the headship of the College. During the following years\r\nhe does not seem to have been much in Oxford, and it was not till\r\n1630, when he was made Chancellor, that he exercised effective control\r\nover the University. While he was busied in the affairs of the Church\r\nat large, and was rising step by step to the highest ecclesiastical\r\npreferment, his College, under the government of Dr. William Juxon,\r\ngrew in prosperity. Sir William Paddy, always a benefactor, gave a\r\n“pneumatick organ of great cost,” and by his will endowed an organist\r\nwith singing men, and left books and money to the Society of which he\r\nwas, says a College chronicler, a member as munificent as learned. The\r\norgan, though its erection was made by Prynne one of the accusations\r\nagainst Laud, escaped destruction during the Rebellion, and was in\r\nuse till 1768. Bishop Buckeridge left more money to the College, and\r\naltar furniture for the chapel. Within the years 1616-1636 large sums\r\nof money came in, and gifts of land and advowsons of livings were made\r\nby persons more or less connected with the College; the buildings\r\nwere added to, and by the time when Laud, as Bishop of London and\r\nChancellor of the University, had set himself to “build at S. John’s in\r\nOxford, where I was bred up, for the good and safety of that College,”\r\nthe College, still much less than a century old, was freed from the\r\npecuniary troubles which so much crippled it in its earlier years.\r\n\r\nThe new quadrangle, which was begun in July 1631, when the King gave\r\ntwo hundred tons of wood from the royal forests of Stow and Shotover\r\nto aid in the building, was a magnificent expression of the donor’s\r\ngenerosity and love for the College. It was completed in 1636, and\r\nLaud, now Archbishop of Canterbury, having assigned by special\r\ndirection the new rooms to the library, to the President, and for the\r\nuse of commoners, made elaborate preparations to receive the King and\r\nQueen when they “invited themselves” to him. They brought with them the\r\nKing’s nephew, the Elector Palatine and Prince Rupert, who were entered\r\non the books of S. John’s. Laud’s College and his new library were the\r\ncentre of the entertainments that marked their stay in Oxford. The\r\nArchbishop’s own words[274] give the best account of the festivities.\r\nOn the 30th of August, 1636, he says, “When they were come to S.\r\nJohn’s they first viewed the new building, and that done I attended\r\nthem up to the Library stairs, where as soon as I began to ascend the\r\nmusic began and they had a fine short song fitted for them as they\r\nascended the stairs. In the Library they were welcomed to the College\r\nwith a short speech made by one of the Fellows (Abraham Wright). And\r\ndinner being ready they passed from the old into the new library, built\r\nby myself, where the King, the Queen and the Prince Elector dined at\r\none table which stood cross at the upper end. And Prince Rupert with\r\nall the lords and ladies present, which were very many, dined at a long\r\ntable in the same room. When dinner was ended I attended the King and\r\nthe Queen together with the nobles into several withdrawing chambers,\r\nwhere they entertained themselves for the space of an hour. And in\r\nthe meantime I caused the windows of the hall to be shut, the candles\r\nlighted, and all things made ready for the play to begin. When these\r\nthings were fitted, I gave notice to the King and Queen and attended\r\nthem into the hall. … The play[275] was very good and the action. It\r\nwas merry and without offence, and so gave a great deal of content.\r\nIn the middle of the play I ordered a short banquet for the King,\r\nthe Queen, and the lords. And the College was at that time so well\r\nfurnished as that they did not borrow any one actor from any College\r\nin town. The play ended, the King and Queen went to Christ Church.” A\r\ncontemporary notes among the quaintnesses of the entertainment that\r\n“the baked meats were so contrived by the cook, that there was first\r\nthe forms of archbishops, then bishops, doctors, etc., seen in order,\r\nwherein the King and courtiers took much content.” “No man,” says Laud,\r\n“went out at the gates, courtier or other, but content; which was a\r\nhappiness quite beyond expectation.” The next day, when the royal party\r\nhad left, the Chancellor entertained the University authorities, “which\r\ngave the University a great deal of content, being that which had never\r\nbeen done by any Chancellor before.” “I sat with them,” he says, “at\r\ntable; we were merry, and very glad that all things had so passed to\r\nthe great satisfaction of the King and the honour of that place.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Laud had not only given to his own College a notable\r\nposition in the University, but had reformed and legislated for the\r\nUniversity itself. The statutes had long been in confusion; Convocation\r\nin any case of difficulty passed a new rule which frequently conflicted\r\nwith the old statutes, and the government of the undergraduates\r\nseems to have been very lax. The University submitted its laws to\r\nthe Chancellor, who, with the aid of a learned lawyer of Merton\r\nCollege, revised and codified them. How he desired that the students\r\nshould be ruled may be seen by his careful direction to the heads of\r\nColleges,[276] that “the youths should conform themselves to the public\r\ndiscipline of the University. … And particularly see that none, youth\r\nor other, be suffered to go in boots or spurs, or to wear their hair\r\nundecently long, or with a lock in the present fashion, or with slashed\r\ndoublets, or in any light or garish colours; and that noblemen’s sons\r\nmay conform in everything, as others do, during the time of their abode\r\nthere, which will teach them to know the difference of places and order\r\nbetimes; and when they grow up to be men it will make them look back\r\nupon that place with honour to it and reputation to you.” So successful\r\nwas he in impressing the spirit of discipline and self-restraint,\r\nthat Sir John Coke was able to congratulate the University in 1636\r\nthat “scholars are no more found in taverns, nor seen loitering in the\r\nstreets or other places of idleness or ill-example, but all contain\r\nthemselves within the walls of their Colleges, and in the schools\r\nor public libraries, wherein I confess you have at length gotten\r\nthe start, and by your virtue and merit have made this University,\r\nwhich before had no paragon in any foreign country, now to go beyond\r\nitself and give a glorious example to others not to go behind.” In\r\nthe Register of S. John’s College there are curious examples of the\r\ndiscipline maintained. To take an instance from a somewhat later\r\ntime, under the date of April 4th, 1668, we have “Memorandum, that I,\r\nThomas Tuer, being convented and convicted, _secunda vice_, before the\r\nVice-President and Seniors of the breach of the statutes _de morum\r\nhonestate_ by injuriously striking Sir Waple, was for this my fault\r\naccording to the statutes on that behalf put out of commons for 15\r\ndays. Thomas Tuer.”\r\n\r\nBy his example of conscientious perseverance, by his devotion to\r\nlearning, and by his munificent building and endowment, Laud had\r\nbrought both his College and the University to a high standard of\r\nculture and research. These were indeed the halcyon days of S. John’s,\r\nwhen Laud, its “second founder,” was Chancellor of the University and\r\nPrimate of all England; Juxon his pious and sagacious successor as\r\nPresident was Bishop of London and Lord Treasurer; and Dr. Richard\r\nBaylie governed the College, whose annalist says that never was there\r\nmore diligent scholar, more learned Fellow, or more prudent Head.[277]\r\nBut the University soon fell on evil days; discipline was dissolved,\r\nteaching and learning were alike suspended, and the streets rang with\r\nthe summons to arms. The city bore for several years the aspect at\r\nonce of a camp, and of an exiled Court. In these troubles S. John’s\r\nhad its full share. Scholars joined the King’s troops, Fellows were\r\ndriven from their country livings, the College gave up its treasures\r\nto the Royal cause. In the College Register of 1642 is inserted the\r\nfollowing letter--“Charles R. Trusty and well beloved, we greet you\r\nwell. We are so well satisfied with your readiness and Affection to\r\nour service that we cannot doubt but you will take all occasions to\r\nexpress the same. And as we are ready to sell or engage any of our\r\nlands, so we have melted down our Plate for the payment of our Army\r\nraised for our defence and the preservation of the Kingdom. And having\r\nreceived several quantities of Plate from divers of our loving subjects\r\nwe have removed our Mint hither to our City of Oxford for the coining\r\nthereof. And we do hereby desire you that you will send unto us all\r\nsuch plate of what kind soever which belongs to your College, promising\r\nyou to see the same justly repaid unto you after the rate of 5_s._ the\r\nounce for white, and 5_s._ 6_d._ for gilt plate as soon as God shall\r\nenable us. For assure yourselves we shall never let persons of whom we\r\nhave so great a care to suffer for their affection unto us, but shall\r\ntake special order for the repayment of what you have already lent to\r\nus according to our promise. … And we assure ourselves of the very\r\ngreat willingness to gratify us herein, since besides the more public\r\nconsiderations you cannot but know how much yourselves are concerned in\r\nour sufferings. And we shall always remember this particular service to\r\nyour advantage. Given at our Court at Oxford this 6th day of Jan. 1642\r\n(1643).”\r\n\r\n“In answer to his Majesty’s letters,” says the Register, “it was\r\nconsented and unanimously agreed by the President and Fellows of the\r\nCollege that the plate of the College should be delivered unto his\r\nMajesty’s use.” It was melted down, and the coin so struck was stamped\r\nwith the initials of the President, Dr. Richard Baylie.\r\n\r\nIn June 1643 the King wrote again to the College, asking that some of\r\nits members should subscribe 4_s._ a week for a month for the support\r\nof soldiers: “we do assure you on the word of a king that this charge\r\nshall lie on you but one month.” Soon after this Laud resigned his\r\nChancellorship in a touching letter from his prison, and in making\r\nhis will showed the deepest attachment to the College where he “was\r\nbred.” Baylie, who was his executor, was not long suffered to remain\r\nin his post. The Parliamentary Commission which visited the University\r\nin January 1648 ordered that the President of S. John’s College,\r\n“being adjudged guilty of high contempt by denial of the authority of\r\nParliament, be removed from” his office, “and accordingly the said Dr.\r\nBaylie is required forthwith to yield obedience hereunto, and to remove\r\nfrom the said College and quit the said place, and all emoluments,\r\nrights and appointments thereunto belonging.” They abolished the\r\nchoral service, appropriating Sir William Paddy’s endowment to the\r\nincrease of the President’s salary. These Commissioners, says Dr.\r\nJoseph Taylor, were men “in whom there was nothing lacking save\r\nreligion, virtue, and learning,” and the oath which they required of\r\nthe Fellows, for the sake of ejecting them when they refused it, was\r\n“as ridiculous as it was detestable.” In the place of the existing\r\nfoundation they put as President Francis Cheynell, the zealot who had\r\nanathematized Chillingworth as he lay dying (a man, says Taylor, “non\r\ntantum fanaticus sed et furiosus”), and they filled the Fellowships\r\nwith men collected anywhere and than the majority of whom “there could\r\nbe nothing more ignorant or more abject.” Cheynell held the Presidency\r\nonly two years, when he was obliged to make choice between it and a\r\nvaluable living in Sussex. He was succeeded by one Thankful or Gracious\r\nOwen, a Fellow of Lincoln College, under whose rule the College\r\nlanguished in poverty and neglect until the Restoration, its property\r\ndissipated and its learning in decay.\r\n\r\nThe return of the King brought back Head and Fellows. A blank page in\r\nthe College Register is followed by a lease signed by “R. Baylie,”\r\nwithout note or comment on his deprivation or return. The first results\r\nof the Restoration were works of piety. Before long the body of the\r\naged Juxon was laid near the founder beneath the altar in the chapel.\r\nIt was now possible to carry out the last wish of Laud himself, who in\r\nhis will had desired “to be buried in the chapel of S. John Baptist\r\nCollege, under the altar or communion table there.” All was done\r\nprivately, as he had himself directed. Yet the stillness of night,\r\nthe torches and the flickering candles, the reverence of the restored\r\nfoundation to the greatest and most loyal of its sons, must have given\r\na unique solemnity to the scene. “The day then, or rather the night,”\r\nsays Anthony Wood, “being appointed wherein he should come to Oxon,\r\nmost of the Fellows, about sixteen or twenty in number, went to meet\r\nhim towards Wheatley, and after they had met him, about seven of the\r\nclock on Friday, July 24th, 1663, they came to Oxon at ten at night,\r\nwith the said number before him, and his corpse lying on a horse litter\r\non four wheels drawn by four horses, following, and a coach after that.\r\nIn the same way they went up to S. Mary’s Church, then up Cat’s Street,\r\nthen to the back-door of S. John’s Grove; where, taking his coffin out,\r\nthey conveyed [it] to the chapel; when Mr. Gisbey, Fellow of that house\r\nand Vice-President, had spoke a speech, they laid him inclosed in a\r\nwooden coffin in a little vault at the upper end of the chancel between\r\nthe founder’s and Archbishop Juxon’s.”\r\n\r\nThe most interesting period of the College history was during the\r\nreigns of the Stuarts. The same spirit of devotion to the Church and\r\nloyalty to the throne which had animated Laud and Juxon still breathed\r\nin their successors. Tobias Rustat, Esquire, Yeoman of the Robes to\r\nCharles II., and Under Housekeeper of Hampton Court, left a large\r\nsum to endow loyal lectures--two on “the day of the horrid and most\r\nexecrable murder of that most glorious Prince and Martyr”; one to\r\nbe read by the Dean of Divinity, and the other by “some one of the\r\nmost ingenious Scholars or Fellows whom the President shall appoint,”\r\nsetting forth the “barbarous cruelty of that unparalleled parricide”;\r\none by the Dean of Law on October 23rd, “which was the day wherein\r\nRebellion did appear solemnly armed against Majesty”; and a fourth on\r\nthe 29th of May, “setting forth the glory and happiness of that day,”\r\nwhich saw the birth of Charles II. and his “triumphant return.” There\r\nis in the College library a curious portrait of Charles I., over which\r\nin a minute hand several Psalms are written. Tradition has it that when\r\nthe “merry monarch” visited Oxford he asked for this eccentric piece of\r\nwork, and that when, on leaving, in recognition of his loyal welcome\r\nhe offered to give the Fellows anything they should ask, they declared\r\nthat no gift could be so precious as the restoration to them of the\r\nportrait of his father. The story, true or not, could only be told of a\r\nCollege which was famous as the home of devoted loyalty to the Stuarts.\r\nIt was Dr. Peter Mews (or Meaux), Baylie’s successor as President, who\r\nlent his carriage horses to draw the royal cannon to Sedgmoor. When\r\nNicholas Amherst (the author of a collection of scurrilous essays\r\nwhich he called after the name of the licensed buffoon at the Encænia,\r\nTerræ Filius) was expelled the College for his irregularities, he made\r\nup a plausible tale that the reason for his expulsion was that he was\r\nthe only man loyal to the Hanoverian line in a nest of Jacobites.\r\nHe lost no opportunity of attacking the College, with no regard for\r\ntruth or consistency. Dr. Delaune (President 1698-1728) was his most\r\nprominent victim. Once, says he, that learned President was affronted\r\nin the theatre by Terrae Filius, who called out to him by name as\r\nhe came in, shaking a box and dice, and crying “_Jacta est alea_,\r\ndoctor, seven’s the main,” in allusion to “a scandalous report handed\r\nabout by the doctor’s enemies, that he had lost great sums of other\r\npeople’s money at dice.” But Jacobitism was an accusation much more\r\nplausible, and we are inclined not altogether to disbelieve him when\r\nhe says that the Latitudinarian Hoadly was abused in a Latin oration\r\nin chapel as “iste malus logicus, pejor politicus, pessimus theologus;\r\na bad logician, a worse statesman, and the worst of all divines.” Dr.\r\nRichard Rawlinson, who had been a gentleman commoner of the College,\r\nand left to it on his death in 1755 the bulk of his estate, was a\r\ntypical antiquary and worshipper of the exiled House. His collection of\r\nletters and MSS., the researches which he made into the early history\r\nof the Foundation, are among the most cherished possessions of the\r\nCollege. “Ubi thesaurus ibi cor” is the motto of the urn in chapel\r\nwhich contains his heart. His “treasure” was divided between S. John’s\r\nand the Bodleian; his heart, which had beaten with an equal affection\r\nfor the Stuarts and for the College, remained among those who shared\r\nhis semi-sentimental attachment. It was said of Dr. Holmes (President\r\n1728-48) that he was probably the first Fellow, and certainly the first\r\nHead, of the College who was loyal to the Hanoverian Succession. Almost\r\nwithin living memory the Fellows of S. John’s in their Common Room, “a\r\nlarge handsome room, the scene of a great deal of learning and a great\r\nmany puns,”[278] toasted the king “over the water.” Up till the middle\r\nof the present century, indeed, it was a college of survivals. The\r\nold loyal lectures were read, the old “gaudies” held, the old rules\r\nmaintained. Throughout the eighteenth century the founder’s order\r\nagainst absence from College was strictly observed: all permissions\r\nto be away from Oxford were carefully recorded in the Register. Leave\r\nwas at first only granted on the business of the College, or the king,\r\nor a bishop; and it is said of one Dr. Sherard that he had to give up\r\nhis Fellowship when he had exhausted the list of the Episcopal bench.\r\nEven Doctors of Divinity were obliged to get license to “go down.” Dr.\r\nSmith, though Master of Merchant Taylors’ School (died 1730), could not\r\nteach his boys without the College leave to be absent from Oxford. Only\r\nin recent years has iconoclastic modernism destroyed the old progresses\r\nround the College estates, formal fishing of the College waters, and\r\nfestive commemoration of days of ecclesiastical or royalist note. The\r\nhistory of the last and of the present century lies outside the scope\r\nof this sketch, and the share that S. John’s has had in the important\r\nmovements of the last seventy years is left untold. Much has undergone\r\nchange, at the hands of Time and of Parliamentary Commissions; but\r\nthere still lingers one feature of the old life of the University which\r\nelsewhere has passed away. S. John’s alone of all the Colleges has\r\n(1891) no married Fellows; thus here as it can scarcely be elsewhere,\r\nthe College life is most closely centered within the College walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nJESUS COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. LL. THOMAS, M.A., VICE-PRINCIPAL OF JESUS COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJesus College was the first Protestant Society established in Oxford,\r\nand its appearance marks an epoch in the history of the University;\r\nfor “if Christ Church was the last and grandest effort of expiring\r\nMediævalism, if Trinity and St. John’s commemorated the re-action under\r\nPhilip and Mary, Jesus, by its very name, took its stand as the first\r\nProtestant College.”[279]\r\n\r\nIt may seem at first sight that there ought to be little difficulty in\r\ntracing the origin and settlement of a College which thus came into\r\nbeing in the latter half of the sixteenth century; but, partly because\r\nmuch is obscure in the history of the institution out of which it was\r\nerected, and partly because there are practically no College records\r\nfor the first sixty years of its own existence, the historian of Jesus\r\nCollege has very scanty materials for his account of its foundation and\r\nearly annals, and has to put down much which rests rather on inference\r\nthan on documentary evidence.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1460, John Rowse, the Warwick antiquary, wrote down a\r\nlist[280] of Halls and other places of study in Oxford. In this four\r\nHalls are mentioned, all for “legists,” that is, students of Canon\r\nand of Civil Law, viz. White, Hawk, Laurence, and Elm Halls, which\r\nstood on the site now occupied by Jesus College. These represented a\r\nonce greater number of Halls, for Laurence Hall had absorbed Plomer\r\n(or Plummer) Hall; and in White Hall had been merged another White\r\nHall,[281] which stood back to back with it, and apparently (but the\r\nevidence is hardly tangible) other Halls. In the next century the\r\nnumber of Halls was still further reduced, and by 1552 we find White\r\nHall alone left,[282] having possibly drawn into its own precincts the\r\nbuildings of its old neighbours. This White Hall stood on the north\r\nside of Cheyney Lane (now called Market Street), a short distance from\r\nthe corner where it enters the Turl. It was a very old place of study,\r\nbeing mentioned as early as 1262, and having a well-marked succession\r\nof Principals from 1436 to 1552.\r\n\r\nThe point of capital importance in view of its relation to Jesus\r\nCollege is whether, about the time of the Reformation, White Hall\r\nbecame distinctly a Hall for Welsh students; but that point cannot be\r\ndetermined. The occasional and imperfect lists of members of White\r\nHall found up to 1552 exhibit only a few Welsh names, from which it\r\nmay perhaps be inferred that Welshmen were then in a distinct minority\r\nin this Hall. The two graduates of White Hall who are mentioned in\r\n1562[283] are both Welsh, as also are their pupils; but these notices\r\nare a mere accident. If, however, Jesus College took over the inmates\r\nof White Hall, they must have been mostly Welshmen, because the first\r\nCollege list[284] (1572-3, two years after the foundation) exhibits\r\nalmost exclusively Welsh names. On the whole, it is best to say that\r\nthe evidence does not justify the belief that White Hall, which Jesus\r\nCollege superseded, was distinctly a Hall of Welsh students.\r\n\r\nAt the petition of Hugo Price, or Ap Rice, Doctor of Laws, Treasurer\r\nof St. Davids, Queen Elizabeth granted the first Letters Patent, dated\r\nthe 27th of June, 1571, establishing “quoddam Collegium eruditionis\r\nscientiarum, philosophiae, bonarum artium, linguarum cognitionis,\r\nHebraicae, Graecae, et Latinae, ad finalem sacrae Theologiae\r\nprofessionem,” and conferring on the new foundation all the lands,\r\nbuildings, and personalty of White Hall. From these words of the\r\nFoundation Charter it appears that the College was primarily intended\r\nto be a place of training for theologians; a secondary object is thus\r\nsummed up, “denique ad Ecclesiae Christi, regni nostri, ac subditorum\r\nnostrorum communem utilitatem et felicitatem.”\r\n\r\nSoon after the issue of the Letters Patent, but it is not known exactly\r\nwhen, the building of the College began, the first portion erected\r\nbeing two stories of the east front and two staircases[285] of the\r\nsouthern side of the outer quadrangle. For many years, probably till\r\n1618, the work was not extended, and the following story is handed\r\ndown. A stone was inserted in the wall on the south side of the\r\ngateway, bearing this inscription--\r\n\r\n    “Struxit Hugo Prisius tibi clara palatia, Iesu,\r\n        Ut Doctor Legum pectora docta daret.”\r\n\r\n“Nondum,” laughed a University wit, one Christopher Rainald,\r\n\r\n    “Nondum struxit Hugo, vix fundamenta locavit:\r\n        Det Deus ut possis dicere ‘struxit Hugo’!”\r\n\r\nOf the first founder, Hugo Price, very little is known. “He was born,”\r\nWood says, “at Brecknock,[286] bred up as ’tis generally thought, in\r\nOseney Abbey, under an uncle of his that was a Canon there;” he did\r\nnot long survive the foundation of the College, and was buried (August\r\n1574) in the Priory Church at Brecon.\r\n\r\nThe Letters Patent provide for the constitution of the College to\r\nconsist of a Principal, eight Fellows, and eight Scholars, nominate\r\npersons to fill all these places, and arrange for future appointments.\r\n\r\nThe Principal nominated was David Powell, Doctor of Laws. Among the\r\nFellows may be noticed Robert Johnson, B.D.,[287] afterwards Archdeacon\r\nof Leicester, the founder of Uppingham and Oakham Schools. Among the\r\nscholars Thomas Dove, afterwards Bishop of Peterborough, and Lancelot\r\nAndrews, Bishop successively of Chichester, Ely, and Winchester. The\r\nCollege is then incorporated, invested with corporate legal powers and\r\na common seal, and united with the University “ut pars, parcella, et\r\nmembrum.” Concession is granted to Hugo Price to endow the College with\r\nlands and revenues to the amount of a clear £60 per annum, and to the\r\nCollege to receive further endowments to the extent of £100 a year; and\r\nfinally an important body of Commissioners is appointed (including Lord\r\nBurghley and other magnates, and the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor of\r\nthe University, together with the Principal and two Fellows), to draw\r\nup all the necessary statutes for the government of the College. There\r\nis also a tradition that leave was given to the College to receive a\r\nsupply of timber from the royal forests of Stow and Shotover towards\r\nthe erection of the fabric.\r\n\r\nThe second Letters Patent of Queen Elizabeth were issued on the 7th\r\nday of July, 1589, eighteen years after the first patent. Their object\r\nappears to have been to appoint Francis Bevans to the Principalship,\r\nto authorize the College to receive further benefactions to the\r\namount of £200 a year, and to nominate a still more important body\r\nof Commissioners to draw up the College statutes. These second\r\nCommissioners included several ecclesiastical and legal dignitaries,\r\nthe Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the University, the Principal,\r\nand apparently three Fellows of the College, and Richard Harrys,\r\nPrincipal of Brasenose College. The presence of the last-mentioned\r\nCommissioner probably accounts for the fact that the new statutes were\r\nframed upon the model of the Brasenose statutes. There seems to have\r\nbeen some delay in drawing up these statutes, but they were finally\r\ncompleted and ordered to be written “fayre in a Booke.” This “Booke”\r\nseems to have been sent from one Commissioner to another for approval\r\nand correction, and at least once was reported to be lost; but was\r\neventually recovered and deposited in the College.\r\n\r\nThe third Letters Patent concerning the College are those of King\r\nJames I., dated June 1st, 1621, in the fiftieth year of the College.\r\nAfter reciting both the Letters Patent of Queen Elizabeth, the King\r\nconfirms the establishment of the College; arranges for the addition\r\nand co-optation of eight additional Fellows and eight additional\r\nscholars; and incorporates the College anew to consist of sixteen\r\nFellows and sixteen scholars. Further, Sir Eubule Thelwall, one of the\r\nMasters of the Court of Chancery, is nominated to the Principalship;\r\nand vacancies in the Fellowships and scholarships are filled up. It is\r\nworthy of notice that two of the original Fellows, Robert Johnson and\r\nJohn Higgenson, and two of the original scholars, Lancelot Andrews and\r\nThomas Dove, are still retaining their places.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the three documents above-mentioned there\r\nis no word or expression which implies any local limitation of the\r\nCollege. There is no direct or indirect allusion to place of birth\r\nor education in the Letters Patent or in the statutes. And yet the\r\nfounder was a Welshman, and probably intended his new foundation to\r\nbe a Welsh College. The Tudors were always ready to acknowledge their\r\nWelsh origin; hence the readiness of Queen Elizabeth to accede to the\r\nrequest of Dr. Hugo Price, and even to contribute something of her\r\nroyal bounty. Yet no formal means were adopted to secure and continue\r\nthe connection of the College with Wales. If we review the lists of\r\nthe Fellows nominated in the two Letters Patent of Elizabeth, we know\r\nby the names only (even apart from our actual knowledge from other\r\nsources) that they are not all Welshmen. But it is otherwise with the\r\nPrincipals. Every one of these, from the foundation to the end of the\r\neighteenth century, shows by his name[288] his connection with Wales.\r\nThe times in which Dr. Hugo Price lived were times of somewhat despotic\r\ngovernment; the Principal appointed the Foundationers; and it may have\r\nseemed a sufficient safeguard to the first founder if it should become\r\na tradition that the Principal must be a Welshman. At any rate, if\r\nit was not his intention to secure the connection with Wales by such\r\nmeans, it does not seem possible that he could have selected any which\r\nwould have been more successful. From the time of the Restoration it\r\nis exceedingly rare to find the admission of any one to a Scholarship\r\nor Fellowship who was not qualified for the preferment by birth in\r\nWales. It is only important to notice that this exclusiveness grew up\r\nby custom and tradition, but was not ordained by statute or authority.\r\nIn the time of Sir Leoline Jenkins a fixed system was adopted,[289]\r\nand certain Fellowships and Scholarships were assigned respectively to\r\nNorth and South Wales; but it was not so at the first.\r\n\r\nOf the first six Principals, five were Fellows of All Souls, and only\r\ntwo in Holy Orders. The diversity in the authority by which they were\r\nappointed is to be remarked. The first and third were nominated by the\r\nCrown in the Letters Patent; of the appointment of the second there is\r\nno record; the fourth was “elected Principal, 17th May, 1602, by three\r\nFellows that were then in the College”; the fifth was nominated by the\r\nChancellor of the University, and admitted, under his mandate, by the\r\nVice-Chancellor, 8th September, 1613, no Fellows appearing or claiming\r\nthe right of election; the sixth Principal was nominated by the\r\nChancellor, and admitted by the Vice-Chancellor, after a contest with\r\nthe Fellows, which brought about the final settlement of the dispute in\r\nfavour of the College by the third Letters Patent.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this uncertainty is not difficult to discover. Had the\r\nCollege been definitely constituted, the statutes would have provided\r\nfor the filling up of vacancies in the ordinary way of election by\r\nthe Fellows. But the Royal Commissioners had neglected to settle the\r\nCollege by statutes, and the Chancellor of the University claimed to\r\nappoint the Principal of the College as he had enjoyed the right of\r\nappointing the Principal of White Hall.\r\n\r\nThe question between the claims of the Fellows and of the Chancellor\r\nwas brought to an issue in 1620. On 29th June in that year the\r\nChancellor (Lord Pembroke) nominated Francis Mansell (his kinsman and\r\nchaplain) Principal on the death of Griffith Powell; and on 3rd July\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor (Dr. John Prideaux, Rector of Exeter) admitted him\r\nin spite of the protests of the Fellows who claimed the election. On\r\n13th July, Mansell expelled from their Fellowships three of his chief\r\nopponents; and on 17th July the Vice-Chancellor interposed in Mansell’s\r\nfavour the authority of his office against a fourth.[290]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent stages in the dispute are not upon record; but that\r\nMansell felt his position insecure is obvious from his resignation of\r\nthe Principalship and his return to his All Souls Fellowship before\r\nhis year of grace at that College had expired. His successor, Eubule\r\nThelwall, by what authority appointed is not known, obtained within\r\na year the third Letters Patent under which the constitution of the\r\nCollege was finally determined, and the right of election secured to\r\nthe Fellows.\r\n\r\nGriffith Powell, the fifth Principal, had been a considerable\r\nbenefactor, and was the first to extend the buildings of the College\r\nsince the foundation. He began to enlarge it by the addition of the\r\nbuttery, kitchen, and hall; but dying before they could be completed,\r\nhe left them, together with the south side of the outer quadrangle, to\r\nbe completed by Sir Eubule Thelwall, “that most bountiful person, who\r\nleft nothing undone that might conduce to the good of the College.”\r\nFrancis Mansell, his successor, was a Fellow of All Souls, but had been\r\na commoner of the College. He was third son of Sir Francis Mansell,\r\nof Muddlescomb, in the county of Carmarthen. Of him we have very\r\nfull information from the _Life_,[291] by Sir Leoline Jenkins, which\r\npresents a most interesting and vivid picture of the troublous times in\r\nwhich he lived. Dr. Francis Mansell performed the unprecedented feat of\r\nholding the Principalship three times, being twice appointed, and once\r\nrestored, to the office. He watched the growth of the buildings under\r\nthe two great benefactors--Sir Eubule Thelwall and Sir Leoline Jenkins;\r\nand he himself aided the work by his advice, gifts, and diligence in\r\ncollecting contributions.\r\n\r\nOn Mansell’s resignation of the Principalship in 1621 his place was\r\nfilled by Sir Eubule Thelwall. He was the fifth son of John Thelwall\r\nof Bathavarn Park in the county of Denbigh, bred in Trinity College\r\nin Cambridge till he was Bachelor of Arts, then coming to Oxford, was\r\nincorporated here in the same degree in 1579. Afterwards Master of Arts\r\nof this University, Counsellor at Law, Master of the Alienation Office,\r\nand one of the Masters in Chancery, he was admitted Principal in the\r\nmonth of May 1621. He procured from King James a new charter (mentioned\r\nabove), and greatly increased the buildings of the College, not only\r\ncompleting the kitchen, buttery, and hall, but adding a house for the\r\nPrincipal, and the chapel--which, however, was afterwards enlarged\r\nby the addition (in 1636) of a sacrarium. He also built a library,\r\n“with a walk under,” probably a colonnade, to the north of the Hall\r\nand west of his new house; but it is doubtful whether he meant this\r\nto be a permanent building. He enlarged the foundation, augmented the\r\nendowments of the College, and enriched the library with books. He died\r\nOctober 8th, 1630, and was buried in the chapel.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sir Eubule Thelwall, Dr. Francis Mansell was again\r\nappointed to the Headship. Encouraged, perhaps, by the example of his\r\npredecessor, he, in his second tenure of the office, greatly enlarged\r\nthe buildings of the College, “for though our Principall had no fonds\r\nbut that of his owne Zeale, such was the Interest, which his Relation\r\nin Blood to the many noble Families and (which was more prevailing) his\r\npublic and pious Spirit, had procured him, that he had Contributions\r\nsufficient in view to finish and perfect his new Quadrangle; S^{r} George\r\nVaughan of Ffoulkston in Wiltshire having declared that himselfe would\r\nbe at the whole charge of the west end, which was designed to be the\r\nLibrary; but all these pious designes and contributions were lost by\r\nthe dispersions and Ruines that by the Warr befell those who intended\r\nto be our Benefactors.”[292] Notwithstanding, Dr. Mansell was able\r\nto effect much, for he pulled down Thelwall’s library, which does\r\nnot seem to have been a satisfactory building, and erected the north\r\nand south sides of the inner quadrangle. He also enriched the College\r\nwith revenues and benefices, some of which appear to have been since\r\nalienated.\r\n\r\nDr. Mansell was obliged to leave Oxford in 1643, owing to “the sad\r\nnewes of his Brother S^{r} Anthony’s decease, who fell with all the\r\ncircumstances of signall Piety and Vallor in the first Newbury fight;\r\nwhere he commanded as field-Officer under Lord Herbert of Ragland.” He\r\nhad to remain in Wales to settle his brother’s affairs, and look after\r\nhis orphan children for some time; but “the Garrison of Oxon being\r\nsurrendered in 1646, and the Visitation upon the University coming on,\r\nin July 1647, he hastened away from Wales to his station there; and\r\nthough the Earle of Pembroke (who was chiefe in the Action) owned our\r\nPrincipall as his near Kinsman and had a Favour to the College as the\r\nnaturall Visitor thereof by Charter, and though the Earles Two younger\r\nSons who had lived severall years Commoners in the College under our\r\nPrincipall’s charge, offered him their Service with all Affection\r\npossible, yet neither the Propensions of the Earle, nor the Kind\r\noffices of his Sons could bring our Principall to fframe himself to\r\nany the least evasion, much less to the direct owneing of that Power.\r\nBeing ejected out of the Headship, which was not actually done by order\r\nof the Visitors till the one and twentieth day of May 1648, he Applyed\r\nhimself to state all Accompts between him and the College; And having\r\ndelivered the muniments and Goods that belong to it to the hands of\r\nthe Intruders, he withdrew into Wales and took up his Residence att\r\nLlantrythyd, a House of his Kinsman’s, Sir John Auberey’s K^{nt} and\r\nBaronett, which house Sequestration having made desolate, while Sir\r\nJohn was in prison for his Adherence to the King, afforded him the\r\nConveniency of a more private retirement and of having severall young\r\nGentlemen of Quality, his Kindred under his eye, while they were taught\r\nand Bread up by a young man[293] of his College that he had chosen for\r\nthat employment.”\r\n\r\nHere he suffered many persecutions and indignities, “for the Doctor’s\r\nvery Grave and Pious aspect, which should have been a protection to\r\nhim among Salvages, was no other than a Temptation to those (who\r\nreputed themselves Saints) to Act their Insolencies upon him.” At last,\r\ndriven from his retirement, he returned to Oxford, where, “when our\r\nPrincipall came first to Towne, he took up at Mr. Newmans,[294] a Baker\r\nin Holy-well; but the good Offices he dayly rendered to the College\r\ndisposed the then Society so farr to comply with his Inclinations\r\n(which had been allway to live and dye in the College) as to invite\r\nhim to accept of one Chamber for accommodating himself, where he built\r\nseverall faire ones for the Benefitt of the College. This motion was\r\naccepted, and he Lived in the College, near the stoney staires near the\r\nGate, for eight years where he had Leisure to observe many Changes and\r\nRevolutions within those Walls, as without them till that happy one of\r\nhis majestie’s Restauration by God’s infinite Mercy to the College as\r\nwell as to the Nation happily came on.”\r\n\r\nHe was restored to his Headship on the 1st of August 1660, but owing\r\nto “the decayes of Age, especially dimness of Sight,” he resolved\r\nto resign once more. His first wish was that Dr. William Bassett,\r\nFellow of All Souls, should succeed him, “who would have added to the\r\nReputation of the College by his Government, and to the Revenew of it\r\nin all Probability, by his generous minde and ample Fortune; But Dr.\r\nBassett’s want of health not allowing him to accept of the Burthen, it\r\nwas (by the Unanimous Consent of all the Fellowes at a ffree-election\r\nthe first of March, 1660,[295] and with the good Liking of Our Common\r\nFather) devolved upon Dr. Jenkins.[296] This being done he had no other\r\nthought but for Heaven, nor Leasure but for Prayer; he came by degrees\r\nto be confined to his chamber and at last to his Bed and upon the\r\nfirst day of May 1665 he changed this Life for a better of Blisse and\r\nImmortality.”\r\n\r\nThe following items from the _Book of Receipts and Disbursements_, in\r\nDr. Mansell’s own handwriting, are of interest as showing some of the\r\ncharges to which a College was put during the Civil War--\r\n\r\n“Other various and Extraordinary Expenses, most of them peculiar to the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n    Put uppon Domus by M^{r} _Evans_ for Bread and\r\n      Beere to the Kinges Souldiers at their\r\n      first Cominge to _Oxon_ from _Edgehill_               01 : 02 :  6\r\n\r\n    Payd by him the Taxe layd uppon the Coll:\r\n      towards the works from the beginninge of\r\n      it to the 28^{th} of _Jan:_ ’43                       03 : 16 :  6\r\n\r\n    More by him for Musquets, Pikes and the like            03 : 14 :  3\r\n\r\n    Given by him to the Prince his Trumpetters              00 : 10 : 00\r\n\r\n    Payd by Pole after 12^{d} a head every weeke\r\n      for all of the Coll. towards the fortifications\r\n      in _Xst Church_ Meade from the 17^{th}\r\n      of _June_ to the end of _July_                        02 : 11 : 00\r\n\r\n    More towards the same in _Aug._ & _Sept._               02 :  7 : 00\r\n\r\n    For a little Peece of Plate of another man’s,\r\n      which was in my Study, and by mistake\r\n      taken out with the Coll.

Of the first of\r\nthese, Michael Roberts, Sir Leoline Jenkins uses the words “infamous\r\nand corrupt.” Perhaps the words are not to be taken literally; but\r\nnothing of the kind is said of his successor, Francis Howell, though\r\nhe also was a Puritan. It is also on record that in 1656 the Fellows\r\ndeposed Roberts on charges of embezzling the College funds and corrupt\r\ndealing in elections; and that although for the time the Parliamentary\r\nVisitors refused to endorse the action of the Fellows, he did vacate\r\nhis Principalship that year or the next, presumably to avoid expulsion.\r\nAfterwards he “lived obscurely” in Oxford, dying on 3rd May, 1670,\r\n“with a girdle[298] lined with broad gold pieces about him (100£\r\nthey say),” and was buried in St. Peter’s in the East churchyard.\r\nThe appointment in his place of Francis Howell, Fellow of Exeter, on\r\n24th October, 1657, marks the ascendancy of the Independents over the\r\nPresbyterians in Puritan Oxford. The Fellows of the College had elected\r\nSeth Ward (afterwards Bishop of Salisbury), but the Independents\r\npersuaded Oliverus Protector to appoint Howell, after the fashion\r\nalready set in Oxford by Elizabetha Regina, and afterwards followed by\r\nJacobus Rex.\r\n\r\nIn the _Familiar Letters_ of James Howell are some interesting notices\r\nof Oxford and of Jesus College during the times of Mansell, Thelwall,\r\nand Jenkins. The writer, James Howell, son of Thomas Howell, minister\r\nof Abernant in Carmarthenshire, was born about 1594; and entered Jesus\r\nCollege, where he took his B.A. degree, in 1613. During his absence\r\nabroad in the diplomatic service he was chosen on the Foundation\r\nof his College by Sir Eubule Thelwall; but whether he was actually\r\nadmitted is not recorded. Space forbids extracting from his letters\r\nthe entertaining passages about Oxford; but this is the less to be\r\nregretted since the letters are found in many editions, the last being\r\nissued in 1890.\r\n\r\nSome years after Howell had left College, viz. in 1638, Henry Vaughan,\r\n“The Silurist,” entered. In early life he does not seem to have written\r\nmuch; it was owing to illness and trouble that he was led to imitate\r\nand often to excel the devotional poetry of George Herbert. This is not\r\nthe place to dwell upon his merits. His works have been little read,\r\nbut have gradually asserted their claim to an enduring place in English\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards his twin brother, Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius\r\nPhilalethes), an eminent writer, philosopher, and chemist, was educated\r\nin the College. In 1644, James Usher, Archbishop of Armagh, was\r\nresident in and a member of the College. At a still earlier period\r\n(1602), Rees Prichard was a member of the College. He was afterwards\r\nVicar of Llandovery, and became an eminent poet. His book _Canwyll\r\ny Cymru_, is the best known and most highly valued collection of\r\ndevotional and religious poetry in the Welsh language.\r\n\r\nThe above were all Anglican Churchmen and Royalists, but there\r\nwas at this period some Puritanism in the College. “The growth of\r\nPuritan feeling in the city of Oxford is shown by the formation of\r\nthe first Baptist Society under Vavasour Powell of Jesus College, in\r\n1618. He made many converts in Wales, and in 1657 we hear of John\r\nBunyan accompanying him to Oxford. Powell died at last in the Fleet\r\nPrison.”[299]\r\n\r\nAmong other distinguished members of the College during the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries may be briefly mentioned Dr. John Davies\r\n(1573), a Welsh scholar and grammarian; John Ellis (1628), author of\r\n_Clavis Fidei_; Edward Lhwyd (1682), a celebrated antiquary, and keeper\r\nof the Ashmolean Museum; Henry Maurice (1664), a learned divine and\r\nMargaret Professor of Divinity; David Powel (1571), a learned divine\r\nand eminent antiquary; his son Gabriel Powel (1592), considered “a\r\nprodigy of learning”; John White, M.P. (1607), a well-known character\r\nduring the Commonwealth; John Williams (1569), Margaret Professor\r\nof Divinity, Dean of Bangor, and author; Sir William Williams, a\r\nvery eminent lawyer and statesman, Speaker of the House of Commons,\r\nSolicitor-and Attorney-General (1688); Owen Wood (1584), Dean of\r\nArmagh, a considerable benefactor to the College; with many Bishops, a\r\nlist of whom is here given:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishops educated in Jesus College._\r\n\r\n    1.

He almost completed the\r\nbuildings, restored discipline, fostered study, augmented the revenues,\r\nand at his death left his whole estate to the College. He therefore\r\ndeserves a somewhat fuller record of his life than any of his\r\npredecessors or successors. His charges as a Judge and Commissary of\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, and his correspondence as an Ambassador\r\nwere published by William Wynne, Esq., of the Middle Temple, in 1734,\r\nin two large folio volumes; to this is prefixed a memoir from which we\r\ngather the following facts--\r\n\r\n“He was born in the year 1625, in the parish of Llanblithian, in the\r\ncounty of Glamorgan, and was the son of Leoline Jenkins, or Jenkins\r\nLlewelyn, of the same place, a man of about £40 a year, and who left\r\nbehind him in that neighbourhood the character of a very honest,\r\nprudent, and industrious man. The first Essays and Foundation of his\r\nson’s future Learning were laid at Cowbridge School, very near the\r\nplace of his birth and even then no inconsiderable School, which, as\r\na grateful Acknowledgement of benefits there received, he afterwards\r\nliberally endowed.\r\n\r\n“He was admitted into Jesus College in the year 1641, not quite 16\r\nyears of age. Mr. Jenkins’ behaviour from his first appearance in\r\nCollege was so regular and exact that a good Opinion was soon taken of\r\nhim. But the Troubles of the Nation soon after coming on, Mr. Jenkins\r\ntook Arms for the Royal Cause. Thus were his tender years seasoned\r\nand exercised not only with Learning and Diligence, but also with an\r\nequal Mixture of Adversities, the best Preparatives for the succeeding\r\nVarieties of his Life. For the Society into which Mr. Jenkins had been\r\nadmitted, was not only obliged to give way to Strangers, but also the\r\nCollege itself was dismantled, and became Part of a Garrison by Order\r\nfrom Court; and for some time continued to be the Quarters of the Lord\r\nHerbert afterwards Marquiss of Worcester, and of other persons of\r\nQuality, that came out of Wales on the King’s Service. The Garrison of\r\nOxford being surrendred in the year 1646, and the Visitation of the\r\nUniversity by the two Houses coming on in the following year, this\r\nCollege, among others, soon felt the fatal Effects of it, for of 16\r\nFellows and as many Scholars, there remained but one Fellow and one\r\nScholar that was not ousted of their Subsistance. Mr. Jenkins retired\r\nto Wales and settled not far from Llantrythyd where Dr. Mansell was\r\nliving at the House of Sir John Auberey who was an adherent of the\r\nRoyal Cause. The first employment found for Mr. Jenkins was the tuition\r\nof Sir John’s eldest son. Being indicted for keeping a Seminary of\r\nRebellion and Sedition, he was forced to leave that Countrey and\r\nremoved with his Charge to Oxford in May 1651, and settled there in a\r\nTown-house belonging to Mr. Alderman White[302] in the High-street,\r\nwhich from him was then commonly called and known by the Name of\r\nthe Little Welsh-Hall. Mr. Jenkins’s regular and orthodox Behaviour\r\nat Oxford was not quite so close and reserved, as to escape all\r\nObservation, but he began to give Offence to some of the inquisitive\r\nschismatical Members of the University and was obliged to retire from\r\nthence, with his Pupils as it were in his Arms, and go beyond Sea,\r\nfor fear of Imprisonment, or of some worse Disaster. Even this was\r\nno unlucky Accident, for it helped to add to his former Acquirements\r\nthe Knowledge of Men as well as Letters. It gave him an Acquaintance\r\nwith some eminent and learned Men, particularly Messieurs Spanheim and\r\nCourtin; it was the Means of acquiring a great Accuracy in the French\r\nand other Languages. It appears by a little Diary that he made a Tour\r\nover a great part of France, Holland and Germany, and resided at their\r\nfamous Seats of Learning, especially at Leyden. He returned to England\r\nin 1658, and was invited by Sir William Whitmore, a great Patron of the\r\ndistress’d Cavaliers, to live with him at Appley in Shropshire, where\r\nhe continued till the year 1660 enjoying the Opportunities of Study,\r\nand a well-furnished Library. As soon as the King was restored to his\r\nKingdom and the University to its just rights, Mr. Jenkins returned to\r\nJesus College, about the 35th Year of his Age, and his Reputation among\r\nhis Countrymen was so considerable that upon his first Appearance and\r\nSettlement of the Society, he was chose one of the Fellows, and his\r\nBehaviour gained so fast upon them that he was very soon after, upon\r\nthe Resignation of Dr. Mansell, unanimously chose Principal of the\r\nCollege, and thereupon commenced Doctor of the Civil Law.\r\n\r\n“And indeed the College had never more Occasion of such a Ruler\r\nthan at this Time, when the former Discipline of it had been so\r\nlong interrupted by the late distracted and licentious Times,\r\nand had suffered so much by the Management of his ‘infamous and\r\ncorrupt’ Predecessor.[303] Dr. Jenkins did abundantly satisfie the\r\nHopes conceived of him; he made it his first Concern to restore the\r\nExercises, Disputations and Habits, and to review and consider the Body\r\nof Statutes. By these prudent Methods he retrieved the Reputation\r\nand advanced the Discipline of the College. He busied himself in\r\nadding to the Buildings of the College, and completed the Library\r\nand part of the western side of the Inner Quadrangle. He was made\r\nAssessor to the Chancellor and Deputy Professor of Civil Law. He was\r\nalso of singular use to the University in maintaining their Foreign\r\nCorrespondences by his skill in the French and other Languages. He was\r\nalso very instrumental to his Friend and Patron Archbishop Sheldon in\r\nthe Settlement of his Theatre and Printing-House. He not only framed\r\nthe Draught of that Grant with his own Hand, but also the Statute ‘de\r\nVesperiis and Comitiis a B. Virginis Mariæ templo transferendis ad\r\nTheatrum,’ that the House of God might be kept free for its own proper\r\nand pious Uses.\r\n\r\n“The University now became too narrow a Field for such an active Mind\r\nand too scanty an Employment for those high and encreasing Abilities\r\nwhich exerted themselves in him. He was therefore encouraged by his\r\nFriend the Archbishop to remove to London in Order to apply himself to\r\nthe publick Practice of the Civil Law. So he resigned his Principality\r\nin 1673, and was succeeded by Mr. (afterwards Dr.) John Lloyd. The\r\nafter career of the great Lawyer was successful and distinguished,\r\nbut it does not lie within the scope of the present work, so it must\r\nbe very briefly described. He rose to be Judge of the High Court\r\nof Admiralty and Prerogative Court of Canterbury, Ambassador and\r\nPlenipotentiary for the General Peace at Cologne and Nimeguen, and\r\nSecretary of State to King Charles II. He was also made a Knight,\r\nand became Member of Parliament for Hythe, one of the Cinque Ports,\r\nand afterwards Burgess for his own University. It may, however, be\r\nexcusable to give the description of his last return to the College he\r\nloved so much, when his body was brought to be buried by the side of\r\n‘his dear Friend Dr. Mansell in Jesus College Chappel.’\r\n\r\n“The Pomp and Manner of his Reception there and of his Interment is\r\nthus described by one that was an Eyewitness. When the Corps came near\r\nthe City, several Doctors, and the principal Members and Officers of\r\nthe University, the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens, some in Coaches,\r\nsome on Horseback, went out to meet it and conducted it to the Publick\r\nSchools, where the Vice-Chancellor, Bishop of the Diocese and the\r\nwhole Body of the University were ready to receive it and placed it in\r\nthe Divinity-School, which was fitted and prepared for that Purpose,\r\nwith all convenient Ornaments and Decorations. Two Days after, the\r\nVice-Chancellor, several Bishops, Noblemen, Doctors, Proctors and\r\nMasters met there again in their Formalities, as well as many others\r\nthat came to pay their last Respects to him; and the memory of the\r\nDeceased being solemnized in a Latin Oration by the University Orator,\r\nthe Corps was removed to the Chappel of Jesus College. Where the\r\nVice-Chancellor (who happened to be the Principal thereof) read the\r\nOffices of Burial; and another Latin Oration was made by one of the\r\nFellows of the College, which was accompanied with Musick, Anthems\r\nand other Performances suitable to the occasion. After which it was\r\ninterr’d in the area of the said Chappel, with a Marble Stone over his\r\nGrave and a Latin Inscription on it, supposed to be made by his old\r\nFriend Dr. Fell Lord Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church.”\r\n\r\nAmong other benefactions Sir Leoline left his valuable library to\r\nthe College, only reserving forty law-books to begin the library at\r\nDoctors’ Commons in London.\r\n\r\nHis portrait, painted by Tuer, at Nimeguen, hangs in the College\r\nHall; of this painting there are two replicas, one in the Principal’s\r\nLodgings, the other in the Bursary, both so well executed as hardly to\r\nbe distinguished from the original. He is represented sitting by the\r\ncouncil-table in a chair[304] covered with red velvet and holding a\r\nmemorial in his hand. His dress is plain, but decorated with rich lace\r\nat the neck and wrists; his hair is long and flowing; his features\r\nstrongly marked and melancholy in expression.\r\n\r\nThe last Principal of the seventeenth century was Jonathan Edwards, who\r\nseems to have been an able man, and was a benefactor to the College. He\r\ncontributed £1000 to the improvement and decoration of the chapel.\r\n\r\nA long list of benefactions might be written down for the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries; but space allows individual mention of\r\none only. King Charles I. gave (1636) divers lands and tenements in\r\ntrust to the University, that they with the profits of them maintain a\r\nFellow in Jesus College (as also in Exeter and Pembroke Colleges) born\r\nin the Isle of Jersey or Guernsey. To these benefactions conditions\r\nwere generally annexed, the profits to be paid to Fellows or scholars,\r\nfrequently with preference for the kindred of the donor, or for natives\r\nof particular places and counties, or for certain schools in Wales.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century presents a great contrast in interest to its\r\npredecessor. In Jesus College it was exceptionally uneventful. The\r\nbuildings of the College were complete, the north-west corner of the\r\ninner quadrangle being finished in 1713. Since then the College has\r\nnot been altered in form nor enlarged. Several valuable benefactions\r\nwere received, but there was none of the vigour or enthusiasm of\r\nthe sixteenth century. The most considerable endowment was what is\r\nnow called the Meyricke Fund, left in trust to the College by the\r\nRev. Edmund Meyricke. Meyricke was, like the original founder of the\r\nCollege, treasurer of the cathedral church of St. Davids. He was one\r\nof the Ucheldre family, a branch of that of Bodorgan, in Anglesey. He\r\ndeclares in his Will--“as for my worldly estate, which God Almighty\r\nhath blessed me with above my merits or expectation, I dispose of\r\nin manner following: Imprimis, whereas I always intended to bestow\r\na good part of what God should please to bless me withall for the\r\nencouragement of learning in Jesus College, in Oxford, and for the\r\nbetter maintenance of six of the junior scholars of the foundation\r\nof the said College out of the six counties of North Wales; I doe\r\ngive devise and bequeath all my real and personal estate,” &c. The\r\nproperty thus left became very valuable, and a number of Exhibitions\r\nwere established, strictly confined to Welshmen, with a preference for\r\nnatives of North Wales. It has been questioned by some whether this\r\nfund has been beneficial to the College. There is no doubt it made a\r\nUniversity education possible to many Welshmen who would otherwise\r\nnot have thought of an Oxford Degree. These new students, drawn from\r\nthe middle and lower classes in Wales, soon formed a majority of the\r\nundergraduates. It therefore became customary for the sons of Welsh\r\ngentry to resort to other Colleges in Oxford, and to some extent the\r\nold connection was broken. This was a decided loss to the social status\r\nand prestige of the College; but it is probable that the compensating\r\ngain was greater. The young squires who resorted to the University\r\nin the eighteenth century were not as a rule students, and formed an\r\nelement in a College requiring much discipline and toleration. On the\r\nother hand, the students, encouraged by the new endowment, if not\r\nintellectually very distinguished, owing to lack of early advantages,\r\ngenerally made good use of the privileges afforded by the University,\r\nand did solid work for the Principality in after life. When the\r\nendowments of the College were strictly and by statute confined to\r\nWelshmen, it is in Wales that we must look for educational results. And\r\nit must be confessed that when we do look, we are not disappointed.\r\nIn every department of civil life, but especially in the Church, we\r\nfind sons of the College occupying posts of usefulness and dignity.\r\nEven for the highest posts in the Church there was no deficiency of\r\nnative talent, but it was the mistaken policy of the Government under\r\nthe Georges to make use of the Welsh Bishoprics as rewards for English\r\necclesiastics, who were ignorant of the language and characteristics\r\nof the people whom they were supposed to guide--a policy which is now\r\nadmitted to have inflicted serious, and it is to be feared permanent,\r\ninjury on the Church in Wales. Thus in the eighteenth century the\r\nCollege was debarred from furnishing occupants of the four Welsh sees,\r\nthough many of her sons may be pointed out as worthy of the mitre. Soon\r\nafter the mistaken policy was discontinued we have seen half the Welsh\r\nsees occupied by ex-scholars of the College.[305]\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished men of this period may be mentioned Thomas\r\nCharles, B.A., 1779, commonly called Charles of Bala, founder of the\r\nsect of Calvinistic Methodists, and author of the _Geiriadur_, a book\r\nstill much used. He was a man of great piety and learning, and did not\r\nsecede, but was driven out of the Church by the injudicious treatment\r\nof his ecclesiastical superiors. His name is still a “household\r\nword” in Wales. David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr), an eminent Welsh\r\npoet, author of _Cywydd y Drindod_; Thomas Jones, 1760, a painter\r\nof considerable merit, a favourite pupil of Wilson; Evan Lloyd,\r\n1755, a poet, and friend of Churchill, Garrick, Wilkes, &c.; Goronwy\r\nOwen, a celebrated Welsh poet and scholar, one of the great names in\r\nWelsh literature; John Walters, Master of Ruthin School, 1750; James\r\nBandinel, the first Bampton Lecturer (1780); and William Wynne, 1704,\r\na Welsh poet. We may also mention as a contrast to the above, who are\r\nchiefly ecclesiastics, Richard Nash, best known as “Beau Nash,” for\r\nfifty years the celebrated Master of the Ceremonies at Bath, whose\r\nsmile or frown proclaimed social success or ostracism in fashionable\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the eighteenth century the College became in a\r\npeculiar degree connected with the Bodleian Library. In 1747 Humphrey\r\nOwen, Fellow and afterwards Principal, was elected Librarian. After\r\nsome years he made John Price, a Fellow of the College, Janitor, and in\r\n1758 Adam Thomas, M.A., Sub-Librarian; when Thomas quitted the Library\r\nin 1761 his place was taken by Price, John Jones becoming Janitor.\r\nIn 1768, on Owen’s death, Price was made Librarian, and held office\r\nfor forty-five years. From 1758 to 1788 all the Sub-Librarians in\r\nsuccession were members of Jesus College, and nearly all the persons\r\nwho are found otherwise employed in the Library--no full or official\r\nlist exists--bear Welsh names.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson in one of his frequent trips to Oxford made Jesus College\r\nhis head-quarters. This fact has been recently ascertained by Dr. G.\r\nBirkbeck Hill, the well-known authority on Johnson and his times, in\r\npreparing for publication the great lexicographer’s letters. His host\r\nwas his “convivial friend,” Dr. Edwards the Vice-Principal of the\r\nCollege, the editor of Xenophon’s _Memorabilia_, who gave up his rooms\r\nto his guest. These were, probably, situated in the south-western\r\ncorner of the outer Quadrangle on the first-floor. It was early in June\r\n1782 that Johnson came into residence in the College, at a time when he\r\nwas broken in health. Nevertheless, as we learn from Miss Hannah More,\r\nwho was at the time the guest of the Master of Pembroke College, he did\r\nwhat he could to spread cheerfulness around him. The Fellows of Jesus\r\nCollege were to give a banquet in his honour and hers, to which “they\r\ninvited Thomas Warton and all that was famous in Oxford.” Unfortunately\r\nshe does not give us any account of the banquet. Doubtless it was held\r\nand the old Hall rang with the sound of Johnson’s deep voice, but\r\nnot an echo has been caught. The fact of his residence is curiously\r\nconfirmed by the Battel-books, which show that at the time when he was\r\nin Oxford the Battels of Dr. Edwards and other members of the College\r\nwere unusually high. In fact, everybody in the College seems to have\r\nindulged in hospitality, no doubt being anxious to let his friends see\r\nthe great man whose sun was now supposed to be so rapidly setting.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first half of the nineteenth century is remote enough from\r\nour times to warrant the mention of a few names of distinguished men\r\nwho have been removed by death. Here, as in the preceding century, we\r\nmust look chiefly to Wales, where we find among Welsh poets, Daniel\r\nEvans (Daniel Ddu); John Jones (Ioan Tegid), a well-known writer and\r\neditor of Welsh books; John Blackwell (Alun), one of the most pleasing\r\nand attractive of Welsh poets; Morris Williams (Nicander), well known\r\nas poet, preacher, and writer in Welsh; and last, but not least, John\r\nRichard Green, the brilliant historian. We must not omit to mention\r\nthe late Principal, Charles Williams, D.D., who was well known in\r\nthe University for his love of his country, his hospitable social\r\nqualities, and his acute and elegant scholarship.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the University Commission, which made such changes in Oxford,\r\ndealt with Jesus College, but forbore from adopting the sweeping\r\nmeasures at one time threatened. The chief change made was that half\r\nthe Fellowships were declared for the future to be open to general\r\ncompetition. This declaration did not excite much opposition or remark\r\nin Wales, though great indignation was expressed when more than\r\ntwenty years later another Commission dealt in the same way with the\r\nscholarships. It should be remembered that the principle was sacrificed\r\nin 1857, and that the opposers of the last Commission could only\r\nadvance arguments of expediency, on which Commissioners are apt to have\r\ntheir own opinions. Whether the change is likely to be for the good of\r\nthe College and of Wales is a point much disputed, and this is not a\r\nplace where it can be discussed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the buildings of the College have not been enlarged\r\nin extent since 1713; many structural alterations have, however, taken\r\nplace. The upper story throughout the College, except on its extreme\r\nwestern side, consisted of attics with dormer windows, which in old\r\npictures gives the College a picturesque appearance. The roof has,\r\nhowever, been raised, and in the outer quadrangle battlements surmount\r\nthe walls; in the inner quadrangle gables mark the points where the\r\ndormer windows formerly existed. The dining-hall, which once had a\r\nfine open oak roof, was, in the time of Principal Hoare, fitted with\r\na plaster ceiling, in order that the space above might form attics to\r\nincrease the accommodation of the Lodgings. Since the enlargement of\r\nthe Principal’s house in 1886 the accommodation is no longer needed,\r\nand it is to be hoped that the hall may soon regain its original\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe chapel, which was consecrated in 1621, has been frequently altered,\r\nand at least once (in 1636) enlarged. The doorway, with its picturesque\r\nporch, bearing the scroll, “Ascendat Oratio, Descendat Gratia,” is\r\nnot the original entrance. When the south wall was being re-faced\r\nsome years ago, another doorway of older workmanship than the present\r\none, was discovered. The change was probably made when the massive\r\nJacobean screen was put up, which now separates the chapel from the\r\nante-chapel. In 1864 the whole interior was restored. Of the success of\r\nthe restoration there may be two opinions; but there is no doubt that\r\nthe widening of the chancel-arch was a mistake, as it has permanently\r\ndwarfed the proportions of the building. The woodwork substituted for\r\nwhat existed previously, though good of its kind, presents too violent\r\na contrast with the screen already mentioned. The east window is a\r\npainted one of some interest, though not of high artistic merit. In the\r\nante-chapel is an excellent copy of Guido’s picture of “St. Michael\r\ntriumphing over the Fallen Angel.” The original is in the Capucini\r\nChurch at Rome. The picture was presented by Lord Bulkeley of Baron\r\nHill in Anglesey.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the whole eastern front of the College was re-faced, and a\r\ntower built. The work was carried out under the superintendence of\r\nMr. Buckler, architect, Oxford, and is admitted to be very well done.\r\nThere are, however, some who think that the old Jacobean gateway was\r\nmore in harmony with the domestic architecture of the College, and more\r\nsuitable to its position in a narrow street.\r\n\r\nThe library contains a considerable number of volumes which are not of\r\ngreat interest to the student of the present day, but is exceptionally\r\nrich in pamphlets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in\r\nworks on Canon Law. A valuable and numerous collection of manuscripts\r\nhas been removed to the Bodleian Library for safety. The best known of\r\nthese is the _Llyfr Coch_, the famous Red Book of Hergest, containing a\r\ncollection of Welsh legends and poetry, which is gradually being edited\r\nby Professor Rhys and Mr. Evans.\r\n\r\nThe College is not exceptionally rich in portraits, but possesses two\r\nof great merit--a portrait of Charles I. by Vandyke, and of Queen\r\nElizabeth by F. Zucchero.\r\n\r\nLike many other Colleges, Jesus College sacrificed its original plate,\r\nof which a goodly inventory exists, to the needs of the Royalist cause\r\nin 1641; but has since been presented with a fair collection, of which\r\nthe most remarkable piece is a very large silver-gilt bowl,[306] given\r\nby Sir Watkin Williams Wynn in 1732.\r\n\r\nNothing has been said above of the Church patronage of the College,\r\nwhich is considerable, advowsons being a favourite form of bequest with\r\nthe donors already mentioned, and with others. Unfortunately, few of\r\nthe livings are situated in Wales. Thus many able Welshmen have been\r\nwithdrawn from the service of their national Church to their own loss\r\nand that of their country.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that no considerable benefaction has been given to\r\nthe College during the present century. The history of Jesus College\r\nhas thus been brought down to living memory, which is the limit of this\r\nwork. Perhaps more space has been taken up than an existence of little\r\nover three hundred years deserves. But the College holds a unique\r\nposition in Oxford as having a strong connection, notwithstanding much\r\nalienation, with a Principality which is not yet English in language\r\nor feeling. Such a connection has many advantages, and perhaps some\r\ndrawbacks. It is to be hoped that the College will be left undisturbed\r\nlong enough to prove that the latter are altogether outweighed by the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nWADHAM COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY J. WELLS, M.A., FELLOW OF WADHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWadham College occupies an interesting position in the history of the\r\nUniversity, as having been the last College founded until quite recent\r\ntimes, for both Pembroke and Worcester were but expansions of older\r\nfoundations. Though actually dating from the reign of James I., it may\r\nbe said to share with Jesus College the honour of belonging to the days\r\nof Elizabeth, as its founder and foundress were well advanced in years\r\nat the time when they carried out their long meditated plans, and both\r\nin the spirit which animates its statutes and in the architecture of\r\nits fabric, Wadham College belongs rather to the sixteenth than to the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the College, Nicholas Wadham, of Merifeild, in the\r\ncounty of Somerset, belonged to one of the oldest and wealthiest of\r\nthe untitled families of the West of England. He married Dorothy,\r\ndaughter of Sir William Petre, the well known benefactor of Exeter\r\nCollege, but having no children, he resolved to devote his great wealth\r\nto some pious use. Antony à Wood tells us that his original intention\r\nhad been to found a College at Venice for English Romanists, but that\r\nhe was persuaded to change his plans; the story[307] seems doubtful,\r\nand Nicholas Wadham at all events died in the Anglican communion. All\r\nhis patrimonial estates went to his three sisters, who had married\r\ninto some of the chief families of the West of England; but he had for\r\nsome time past been accumulating money for his new foundation; and in\r\ntwo conversations held with his nephew and executor, Sir John Wyndham,\r\nvery shortly before his death, he had given full directions as to many\r\npoints in the College. Of these two were especially notable: he desired\r\nthat the Warden as well as the Fellows should be unmarried; and also\r\nthat each of them should be “left free to profess what he listed, as\r\nit should please God to direct him;” he did not wish them to “live\r\nthro’ all their time like idle drones, but put themselves into the\r\nworld, whereby others may grow up under them.” He also arranged that\r\nthe College should be called after his own name, and that the Bishop of\r\nBath and Wells should be perpetual Visitor.\r\n\r\nHis widow and executors set to work at once to carry out his\r\nwishes, and the present site of the College was purchased from\r\nthe city of Oxford for £600. It had formerly been occupied by the\r\nAugustinian Friars, whose name survived in the old phrase for degree\r\nexercises,[308] “doing Austins,” down to the beginning of this century.\r\nThe foundation stone was laid with great ceremony on July 31st, 1610,\r\nand two years later the foundress, having some time previously obtained\r\na charter from James I., put forth her statutes (August 16th, 1612).\r\nIn these her husband’s wish was carried out by the provision that\r\nFellows should resign their posts eighteen years after they had ceased\r\nto be regent masters: this provision remained in force down to the\r\ncommission of 1854. Originally the Warden was not required to be in\r\norders, but was allowed to proceed to his Doctorate in Law or Medicine\r\nas well as in Divinity; but the foundress was persuaded to alter her\r\narrangements on this point, and the two former alternatives were struck\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThere were to be fifteen Fellows and fifteen scholars, the former\r\nbeing elected from among the latter; of these three scholars were to\r\nbe from Somerset, and three from Essex, while three Fellowships and\r\nthree scholarships were restricted to “founder’s kin.” These were\r\noriginally intended for the children and descendants of the sisters\r\nabove-mentioned, but in course of time it became frequent to trace\r\nkinship with the founder through collateral branches of the Wadham\r\nfamily. The buildings erected by the foundress are remarkable in more\r\nways than one. Their architect, who is supposed to have been Holt[309]\r\nof York, the architect of the New Schools, was employed at several\r\nother Colleges in Oxford, _e. g._ at Merton, Exeter, Jesus, University,\r\nand Oriel. The resemblance between the inner quadrangle at the first\r\nof these and that of Wadham is very marked. Owing to the extent of the\r\noriginal design and the excellence of the building material employed,\r\nWadham has the unique honour among the Colleges of Oxford of having\r\nremained practically unaltered since it left its foundress’ hands.\r\n\r\nOf the various parts of the building the hall and the chapel are the\r\nmost remarkable; the latter in the shape of its ante-chapel is a\r\ncombination of the short nave found at New College and of transepts\r\nsuch as are found at Merton; while in the tracery of the windows of its\r\nchoir it furnishes a continual puzzle to architectural theorists; for\r\nthough undoubtedly every stone of it was built at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, and though the wood-work is pure Jacobean, the\r\nwindows both in their tracery and in their mouldings belong to a period\r\none hundred and fifty years earlier. In fact the chapel is exactly one\r\nof the magnificent choirs with which the churches of Somerset abound,\r\nand it is difficult to believe that the resemblance is not more than\r\naccidental; for in the building documents of the College we have clear\r\nevidence of both materials and workmen coming from the county of the\r\nfounder. The cost of the whole building was £11,360.\r\n\r\nEven before it was finished, the new Foundation received a munificent\r\npresent in the shape of the library of Dr. Philip Bisse, Archdeacon\r\nof Taunton, who dying about 1612 left some two thousand books (valued\r\nat £1700?); these books are all distinguished by having their titles\r\ncarefully inscribed in black letter characters on the sides of their\r\npages, near the top, and may be not unworthily compared to the famous\r\nlibrary, the cataloguing of which made Dominie Sampson so happy a\r\nman. The foundress made Dr. Bisse’s nephew an original Fellow of her\r\nCollege, though he had not yet taken a degree, “Ob singularem amorem\r\navunculi ejus,” and also had painted the portrait of the Archdeacon in\r\nfull doctor’s robes, which still adorns the library.\r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 1613, the first Warden, Robert Wright, formerly Fellow\r\nof Trinity College and Canon of Wells, was admitted at St. Mary’s, and\r\nin the afternoon of the same day he in turn admitted the Fellows and\r\nscholars nominated by the foundress. Wright, however, very shortly\r\nresigned his position, because (says Wood) he was not allowed to marry.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the College seems to have attracted considerable\r\nattention elsewhere than in Oxford. Among the State Papers in the year\r\n1613 is calendared (somewhat incongruously) a parody of the statutes\r\nof Gotam College, founded by Sir Thomas à Cuniculis,[310] with a\r\nlicense from the Emperor of Morea; and from the first the number of men\r\nmatriculated was very large, and the class from which they were drawn\r\na wealthy one. This is most clearly proved by the fact that although\r\nthe College had been in existence less than thirty years when the Civil\r\nWar broke out, the amount of plate surrendered by it to the King was\r\nonly surpassed by one other Foundation. The College still possesses\r\nan inventory of articles given, which make up “100 lbs. of white\r\nplate and 23 lbs. of gilt plate.” As might have been expected, a large\r\nproportion of the members of the College at this period, and for long\r\nafter, came from the West country; two-thirds, probably, were from\r\nDorset, Somerset, or Devon; and this connection has happily never been\r\nentirely broken. Among these West countrymen was the famous Admiral,\r\nRobert Blake, who graduated from Wadham in 1617 at the age of twenty,\r\nand was still in residence six years later. His portrait now hangs in\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nDuring this first period of College life, down to the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion, two events deserve a passing notice. The first of these\r\nwas the fierce controversy[311] waged between James Harrington, one\r\nof the original Fellows, and the rest of the Foundation, as to his\r\nright to retain his place, although he possessed an annual pension\r\nof £40 a year. There are numerous references to this in the Calendar\r\nof State Papers; and Laud, as Bishop of Bath and Wells, was put to\r\nno small trouble to decide it. In the end Harrington apologized for\r\n“having behaved himself in gesture and speeches very uncivilly”; but\r\nthe quarrel only ended with the expiration of his Fellowship in 1631.\r\nMuch more important was the attempt of King James, in 1618, to obtain\r\na Fellowship for William Durham of St. Andrews, “notwithstanding anie\r\nthing in your statutes to the contrarie.” Unfortunately we know very\r\nlittle about this early parallel to James II.’s attempt at Magdalen;\r\nbut the College clearly was successful in upholding its rights.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not altogether fanciful to trace the feelings of the\r\nCollege as to James I. in the register next year (1619), when its usual\r\ndry formality is given up, and Carew Ralegh the son of the King’s late\r\nvictim, is entered as “fortissimi doctissimique equitis Gualteri Ralegh\r\nfilius.”\r\n\r\nWadham, during this same period, completed its material fabric by\r\nreceiving the gift of the large east window of the chapel from Sir\r\nJohn Strangways, the founder’s nephew; it was made on the premises by\r\nBernard van Ling, and the total cost was £113 17_s._ 5_d._ (including\r\nthe maker’s battels for ten months and a week--£2 17_s._ 8_d._).\r\n\r\nThe Civil War affected Wadham as it did the rest of the University. Its\r\nplate disappeared as has been said, only the Communion plate (“donum\r\nfundatricis”) being spared; its students were largely displaced to\r\nmake room for the King’s supporters, among whom the Attorney-General,\r\nSir Edward Herbert, seems to have made Wadham a kind of family\r\nresidence. After the final defeat of the King, the Warden, Pytt, and\r\nthe great majority of the Foundation were deprived by the Parliamentary\r\nCommissioners. But it may be fairly said that the changes made did\r\nfar more good than harm to the College. The man appointed to the\r\nvacant Wardenship was the famous John Wilkins, divine, philosopher,\r\nand mathematician, who enjoyed the almost unique honour of being\r\npromoted by the Parliament, by Richard Cromwell, and by Charles\r\nII., and to whom the College owes the honour of being the cradle of\r\nthe Royal Society. Evelyn records in his _Diary_ (July 13th, 1654),\r\nhow “we all dined at that most obliging and universally-curious Dr.\r\nWilkins’s, at Wadham Coll.”--and speaks of the wonderful contrivances\r\nand curiosities, scientific and mechanical, which he saw there. Round\r\nWilkins gathered the society of learned men who had previously begun\r\nto meet in London, and who were afterwards incorporated as the Royal\r\nSociety. The historian of that famous body, Dr. Sprat, afterwards\r\nBishop of Rochester and himself a member of the Foundation of Wadham\r\nCollege, records[312] how “the first meetings were made in Dr. Wilkins\r\nhis lodgings, in Wadham College, which was then the place of resort\r\nfor virtuous and learned men,” and that from their meetings came\r\nthe great advantage, that “there was a race of young men provided\r\nagainst the next age, whose minds receiving their first impressions\r\nof sober and generous knowledge were invincibly armed against all the\r\nencroachments of enthusiasm.” The traditional place of these meetings\r\nis the great room over the gateway, though this is more than doubtful.\r\nOf the original members, there belonged to Wadham College, besides\r\nWilkins--Richard Napier, Seth Ward, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, the\r\nfamous mathematician; and last but not least, that “prodigious young\r\nscholar, Mr. Christopher Wren,” who after being a Fellow Commoner at\r\nWadham College, was elected Fellow of All Souls, and who showed his\r\naffection for his original College by the present of the College clock\r\nand a beautiful sugar-castor, of which the latter is still in daily\r\nuse, while the face, at any rate, of the former remains in its old\r\nplace. The works of the clock are preserved in the ante-chapel as a\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nWarden Wilkins had for two hundred years the distinction of being\r\nthe only married Warden of Wadham. His wife was a sister of the\r\nLord Protector, with whom he had great influence, which he used\r\nfor the benefit of the University as a whole, and of individual\r\nRoyalists. Anthony Wood seems mistaken in saying that Wilkins owed his\r\ndispensation to marry to his connection with Cromwell. The original MS.\r\nin the possession of the College bears date January 20th, 1652 (four\r\nyears before Wilkins actually married), and comes from the Visitors of\r\nthe University of Oxford. Of both Wren and Wilkins there are portraits\r\nin the Hall.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished undergraduates of this period were John, Lord\r\nLovelace, who took a prominent part in the Revolution (a fine portrait\r\nof him by Laroon hangs in the College hall), William Lloyd, afterwards\r\nBishop of St. Asaph, and one of the famous “Seven Bishops,” and the\r\nnotorious Mr. Charles Sedley, a donor of plate to the College, all of\r\nwhom matriculated in 1655. An even better known member of Wadham was\r\nJohn Wilmot, the wicked Earl of Rochester, who matriculated in 1659,\r\nimmediately after Warden Wilkins had been promoted to the Mastership\r\nof Trinity College, Cambridge; but as he proceeded to his M.A. in\r\nSeptember 1661, being then well under fourteen, he probably did not\r\ngive much trouble to the disciplinary authorities. John Mayow too,\r\nthe distinguished physician and chemist, who became scholar in 1659,\r\ncontinued the scientific traditions of the College.\r\n\r\nWilkins and three of his four successors all became Bishops; of these\r\nthe most famous was Ironside, who, as Vice-Chancellor in 1688, ventured\r\nto oppose James II. in his arbitrary proceedings against Magdalen.\r\nThe fall of James saved Ironside, who was made Bishop of Bristol (and\r\nafterwards of Hereford) by William III., and was succeeded by Warden\r\nDunster, the object of Thomas Hearne’s hatred and contempt. He accuses\r\nhim[313] of being “one of the violentest Whigs and most rascally\r\nLow Churchmen” of the time, and of various other defects, physical\r\nand moral, which may perhaps be conjectured to be in Hearne’s mind\r\nconvertible terms with the above.\r\n\r\nWadham as a whole during this period was strongly Whig and Low Church;\r\nnot improbably this was due to its close connection with the West\r\ncountry, where the suppression of Monmouth’s rebellion had taught men\r\nto hate the Stuarts; but whatever the reason, the fact is undoubted.\r\nProbably there is no other College hall in England which boasts of\r\nportraits both of the “Glorious Deliverer” and of George I.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, Hearne’s account of the College is extremely\r\nblack. He dwells on the blasphemies[314] for which a certain Mr.\r\nBear of Wadham was refused his degree; and even the distinguished\r\nscholar, Dr. Hody, the Regius Professor of Greek and Archdeacon of\r\nOxford, is continually attacked by him, though he admits “he was very\r\nuseful.”[315] Hody, both in his life and by his will, showed himself\r\na loyal son of his College. Dying at the early age of forty-six,\r\nhe bequeathed the reversion of his property to Wadham, for the\r\nencouragement of Hebrew and Greek studies; and the ten exhibitions\r\nhe founded (now made into four scholarships) have been especially\r\nsuccessful in developing the study of the former language. A far\r\ngreater scholar than Hody belongs in part to Wadham at the same period.\r\nIn 1687 Richard Bentley was incorporated M.A. of Oxford from St. John’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge, and put his name on the books of Wadham. He was in\r\nOxford as tutor to the son of Bishop Stillingfleet.\r\n\r\nAlmost to the same period belong the buildings erected on the south\r\nside of the College (No. IX. staircase), which were begun in 1693,\r\nand finished next year; it was intended to build a similar block on\r\nthe north side, beyond the Warden’s lodgings, as is shown in some old\r\nprints, but this was never carried out. I am unable to assign a date\r\nto No. X. staircase. It certainly belonged to the College before the\r\nfinal purchase of the staircase next the King’s Arms (No. XI.), which\r\nwas made early in the present century: there exists a drawing of it in\r\na much earlier style of architecture than the present, or than that of\r\nNo. IX.\r\n\r\nThe only other person worthy of special mention connected with the\r\nCollege at this period, was Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons throughout the reign of George II., who matriculated in 1708;\r\nhis affection for Wadham is illustrated by the splendid service-books\r\npresented by him to the chapel, while two excellent portraits show the\r\npride which the College felt in him.\r\n\r\nThe fifty years which follow the promotion of Warden Baker to the\r\nsee of Norwich in 1727 were an undistinguished period in the history\r\nof Wadham, as in that of the University generally. Of the four\r\nWardens, only one, Lisle, became a bishop, and there is reason to\r\nthink the College was in a bad state; very few of its members rose\r\nto distinction, though James Harris of Salisbury, the author of\r\n_Hermes_[316] (whose portrait by Reynolds hangs in the hall), Creech,\r\nthe translator of Lucretius, and Kennicott, the Hebrew scholar, might\r\nbe mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut in Warden Wills, who was appointed in 1783, the College found its\r\nmost liberal benefactor since the death of the foundress. It was in\r\nhis time that the present beautiful garden was laid out on the site\r\nof the old formal walks, with a mound in the centre, which appear in\r\nthe prints of the last century. It has been conjectured with some\r\nprobability that “Capability” Brown had a hand in the laying out of the\r\ngarden as it now is. Whoever was the gardener, it may be confidently\r\nasserted that a finer result was never produced in so small a space.\r\nWarden Wills in another way increased the beauty of the College, by\r\nbuying for the use of the Warden the lease of a large piece of land\r\nto the north of the College property; of this the College afterwards\r\nbought the freehold from Merton, and it was incorporated with the\r\nWarden’s garden.\r\n\r\nEarly in this century too the College received its final extension\r\nin the way of rooms, by purchasing from the University the buildings\r\nbetween itself and the King’s Arms, which had formerly been used by the\r\nClarendon Press; the old name of No. XI. staircase, “Bible warehouse,”\r\nlong preserved in the books of the College the memory of the old use of\r\nthe buildings: probably the site had belonged to the College from the\r\nfirst, and it was only the remainder of a lease that was now bought.\r\nThis purchase was made in the Wardenship of Dr. Tournay, who presided\r\nover the College with dignity and success for twenty-five years till\r\n1831, when he resigned. The most distinguished member of Wadham during\r\nhis time was undoubtedly Richard Bethell, afterwards Lord Westbury,\r\nwho was elected scholar in 1815, before he had completed his fifteenth\r\nyear. This fact is duly recorded, at his own especial wish, on his\r\nmonument in the ante-chapel, as having been the foundation of his\r\nsubsequent success.\r\n\r\nShortly after the resignation of Warden Tournay, the chapel was taken\r\nin hand by the “Gothic Renovators,” a new ceiling was put on, and the\r\nwhole of the east end was recast by the introduction of some elaborate\r\ntabernacle work, which, if not entirely appropriate in design, is yet\r\ninteresting as displaying a careful study of mediæval models most\r\nunusual so early as 1834.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the College since 1831 there is not space to say\r\nmuch. Under Warden Symons it became recognized as the stronghold of\r\nEvangelicalism in the University; so much was this the case that on his\r\nnomination to the Vice-Chancellorship in 1844, he was opposed by the\r\nTractarian party; but this unprecedented step met with no success, as\r\nthe Chancellor’s nomination was confirmed by 883 votes to 183. It was\r\nduring his tenure of the Vice-Chancellorship (1844-8) that proceedings\r\nwere taken against Mr. Ward, and against Tract No. XC. But if on the\r\none hand the College produced leading lights of the Evangelical school,\r\nlike Mr. Fox and Mr. Vores, it also lays claim to Dr. Church, the late\r\nDean of St. Paul’s, and Father Mackonochie. It may well be doubted\r\nwhether there ever was a more brilliant period in the history of Wadham\r\nthan about the middle of the century, when Dr. Congreve was Tutor and\r\none of the leaders in the University of the “Intellectual Reaction”\r\nagainst the Tractarian movement. With him as Tutor was associated the\r\nlate Warden, Dr. Griffiths, whose name will be always remembered as\r\nthat of one whose true interest throughout life was in his College, and\r\nwho ranks among its benefactors by his bequests, especially that of his\r\ncollection of prints and drawings illustrative of the history of the\r\nCollege and of those who had been educated at it.\r\n\r\nUnder them within less than ten years there were in residence as\r\nundergraduates the present Bishop of Wakefield, the late Professor\r\nShirley, Dr. Johnson the Bishop of Calcutta, Mr. B. B. Rogers the\r\nscholarly translator of Aristophanes, Mr. Frederic Harrison, the\r\npresent Warden, Professor Beesly, Dr. Bridges afterwards Fellow of\r\nOriel, Dr. Codrington the missionary and philologer, and others who\r\nmight be mentioned, who have won distinction in ways most various.\r\nWadham carried off three Brasenose Fellowships in succession within a\r\nvery short space of time, just as in 1849 its Boat Club had “swept the\r\nboard” at Henley; these were but the outward signs of the intellectual\r\nand physical activity of the College. And here its story must be left,\r\nfor we are already among contemporaries, while the action of the\r\nCommission of 1854-5 has drawn a gulf for good or ill between old and\r\nmodern Oxford. Enough has been said to show that the sons of Wadham\r\nhave not been altogether unworthy of a College of which other than her\r\nown sons have said that to know her and “to love her was a liberal\r\neducation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. DOUGLAS MACLEANE, M.A., FELLOW OF PEMBROKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPembroke College has its name from William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke,\r\nShakespeare’s friend and patron, thought to be “Mr. W. H.,” the “onlie\r\nbegetter” of the Sonnets. Clarendon calls him “the most universally\r\nloved and esteemed of any man of that age.” This Society, constituted\r\nas a College in 1624, is one of the younger Oxford foundations. But\r\nthere had been a considerable place of religion and learning here from\r\nthe earliest times, Pembroke College having for centuries previously\r\nexisted as _Broadgates_, or, more anciently still, _Segrym’s_ Hall.\r\n\r\nWood calls this Hall “that venerable piece of antiquity.” He believes\r\nthat St. Frideswyde’s Priory had here a distinguished mansion, from\r\nwhich the canons received an immemorial quit rent, and that here their\r\nnovices were instructed. In Domesday it is called Segrim’s Mansions,\r\na family of that name then and for generations afterward holding it\r\nfrom the priory in demesne, with obligation to repair the city wall.\r\nBut in the 38th of Henry III. Richard Segrym, by a charter of quit\r\nclaim, surrenders for ever to God and the Church of St. Frideswyde,\r\n“that great messuage which is situated in the corner of the churchyard\r\nof St. Aldate’s,” the canons agreeing to receive him into their family\r\nfraternity, and after his death to find a chaplain canon to celebrate\r\nservice yearly for his soul, the souls of his father and mother, and\r\nthe soul of Christiana Pady.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early date this house was occupied by clerks, studying the\r\nCivil and Canon Law. It is described as a “nursery of learning,” and\r\n“the most ancient of all Halls.” It retained the name Segrym (sometimes\r\nSegreve) Hall till the accession of Henry VI., when, a large entrance\r\nbeing made,[317] it came thenceforth to be called Broadgates Hall,\r\nthough there were in Oxford several other houses of this name. It was\r\nthe most distinguished of a number of hostels occupied by legists, and\r\nclustered round St. Aldate’s Church, then a centre of the study of\r\nCivil Law, which had come into vogue in the twelfth century. A chamber\r\nbuilt over the south aisle (Docklington’s aisle) of that church was\r\nused as a Civil Law School and also as a law library, the books being\r\nkept in chests, but afterwards chained. Such a library of chained\r\nbooks still exists over one of the aisles of Wimborne Minster. The\r\naisle below was used by the students before and after the Reformation.\r\nThe “Chapel in St. Eldad’s” (Hutten[318] tells us) “is peculier and\r\npropper to Broadgates, where they daily meete for the celebration of\r\nDivine Service.” The fine monument of John Noble, LL.B., Principal of\r\nBroadgates, was formerly in this aisle.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Halls dates from 1420, when unattached students\r\nwere abolished, and every scholar or scholar’s servant was obliged\r\nto dwell in a hall governed by a responsible principal. After the\r\ngreat fire of 1190 they were built of stone. They contained a common\r\nroom for meals, a kitchen, and a few bedrooms, each scholar paying\r\n7_s._ 6_d._ or 13_s._ 4_d._ a year for rent. Every undergraduate was\r\nbound to attend lectures. Discipline however was not very strict. One\r\nsummer’s night in 1520, an ever-recurring dispute happening between the\r\nUniversity and the city respecting the authority to patrol the streets,\r\ncertain scholars of Broadgates had an encounter with the town watch, in\r\nwhich one watchman was killed and one severely hurt. The delinquents\r\nfleeing were banished by the University, but allowed after a few months\r\nto return on condition of paying a fine of 6_s._ 8_d._, contributing\r\n1_s._ 8_d._ to repair the staff of the inferior bedell of Arts, and\r\nhaving three masses said for the good estate of the Regent Masters and\r\nthe soul of the slain man.\r\n\r\nBroadgates Hall becoming a place of importance, and being obliged\r\nto extend its limits, acquired a tenement to the east belonging\r\nto Abingdon Abbey, the monks of which owned also a moiety of St.\r\nAldate’s Church, the other moiety having passed to St. Frideswyde’s,\r\naccording to a curious story related by Wood.[319] A little further\r\neast still was a tenement which the Principal of Broadgates rented\r\nfrom New College (_temp._ Henry VII.) for 6_s._ 8_d._ In 1566 Nicholas\r\nRobinson[320] mentions Broadgates among the eight leading Halls, and\r\nas especially given up to the study of Civil Law. In 1609 Nicholas\r\nFitzherbert[321] says it was a resort of young men of rank and wealth.\r\nIn 1612 it had 46 graduate members, 62 scholars and commoners, 22\r\nservitors and domestics, in all 131 members, being exceeded in numbers\r\nby only five Colleges and one Hall, viz. Christ Church, 240; Magdalen,\r\n246; Brasenose, 227; Queen’s, 267; Exeter, 206; Magdalen Hall, 161. A\r\ncentury later Pembroke had only between 50 and 60 residents, and in the\r\npreceding century, when Oxford had been for a while almost empty, the\r\nnumbers must have been few. The zeal of the reforming Visitors in 1550\r\nhad left the chamber above Docklington’s aisle four naked walls. “The\r\nancient libraries were by their appointment rifled. Many MSS., guilty\r\nof no other superstition than red letters in the front or titles were\r\ncondemned to the fire … such books wherein appeared angles [angels]\r\nwere thought sufficient to be destroyed because accounted Papish, or\r\ndiabolical, or both.” We read of two noble libraries being sold for\r\n40_s._ for waste paper.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII., in 1546, annexed Broadgates, together with the housing of\r\nAbingdon to the new College established by Wolsey under a Papal bull\r\non the site and out of the revenues of St. Frideswyde’s--successively\r\nCardinal College, King Henry VIII.’s College, and Christ Church.\r\n\r\nBroadgates Hall then had filled no inconsiderable part as a place of\r\nlearning when it became Pembroke College. The history of the foundation\r\nof Pembroke is interesting. Thomas Tesdale, or Tisdall (descended\r\nfrom the Tisdalls of Tisdall in the north of England), was a clothier\r\nto Queen Elizabeth’s army, and afterwards attended the Court. Having\r\nsettled at Abingdon as a maltster he there filled the posts of Bailiff,\r\nprincipal Burgess and Mayor. Finally he removed to Glympton, Oxon,\r\nwhere trading in wool, tillage, and grazing he attained to a very\r\ngreat estate, of which he made charitable and pious use, his house\r\nnever being shut against the poor. He maintained a weekly lecture\r\nat Glympton, and endowed Christ’s Hospital in Abingdon. The tablet\r\nplaced in Glympton Church to his wife Maud records the many parishes\r\nwhere “she lovingly annointed Christ Jesus in his poore members.” A\r\nfortnight before Tesdale’s decease in 1610, he made a will bequeathing\r\nthe large sum of £5000 to purchase lands, etc., for maintaining seven\r\nFellows and six Scholars to be elected from the free Grammar School in\r\nAbingdon into any College in Oxford. This foundation Abbot, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, sometime Fellow of Balliol (his brother Robert at this\r\ntime being Master), was anxious to secure for that Society; and the\r\nMayor and burgesses of Abingdon falling in with the plan a provisional\r\nagreement was signed, on the strength of which Balliol College bought,\r\nwith £300 of Tesdale’s money, the building called Cæsar’s Lodgings, for\r\nthe reception of Tesdale’s new Fellows and scholars, and they for a\r\ntime were housed there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, a second benefaction to Abingdon turned the\r\nthoughts of the citizens in a more ambitious direction. Richard\r\nWightwick, B.D.--descended from a Staffordshire family, formerly of\r\nBalliol, and afterward Rector of East Ilsley, Berks, where he rebuilt\r\nthe church tower and gave the clock and tenor bell--agreed, twelve\r\nor thirteen years after Tesdale’s death, to augment the Tesdale\r\nfoundation so as to support in all ten Fellows and ten Scholars. For\r\nthis purpose he gave lands, bearing however a 499 years’ lease (not\r\nyet expired), the rents of which amounted at that time to £100 a year.\r\nThereupon, the Mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses of Abingdon, abandoning\r\nthe previous scheme, desired the foundation of a separate and\r\nindependent College, for which purpose no place seemed more suitable\r\nthan Broadgates Hall. An Act of Parliament having been obtained, they\r\npresented a petition to the Crown, in reply to which King James I. by\r\nLetters Patents dated June 29th, 1624, constituted the said Hall of\r\nBroadgates to be “one perpetual College of divinity, civil and canon\r\nlaw, arts, medicine and other sciences; to consist of one master or\r\ngovernour, ten fellows, ten scholars, or more or fewer, to be known\r\nby the name of ‘the Master, Fellows, and Scholars of the College of\r\nPembroke in the University of Oxford, of the foundation of King James,\r\nat the cost and charges of Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wightwicke.’”\r\nThe better, we are told, to strengthen the new foundation and make it\r\nimmovable, they had made the Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, the Godfather, and King James the Founder of it, “allowing\r\nTesdale and Wightwick only the privileges of foster-fathers.” James\r\nliked to play the part of founder to learned institutions, and the Earl\r\nof Pembroke was a poet and patron of letters--“Maecenas nobilissimus”\r\nSir T. Browne calls him. In his honour the Chancellor was always to\r\nbe, and is still, the Visitor of the College. Moreover, as a Hall\r\nBroadgates had had the Chancellor for Visitor. Wood says that “had\r\nnot that noble lord died suddenly soon after, this College might have\r\nreceived more than a bare name from him.”\r\n\r\nOn August 5th, 1624, Browne, as senior commoner of Broadgates, now\r\nPembroke, delivered one of four Latin orations in the common hall. The\r\nnew foundation was described as a Phœnix springing out of the rubble\r\nof an ancient Hall, and the right noble Visitor, it was foreseen,\r\nwould create a truly marble structure out of an edifice of brick. Dr.\r\nClayton, Regius Professor of Medicine, last Principal of Broadgates and\r\nfirst Master of Pembroke, spoke the concluding oration of the four.\r\nThe Letters Patents were then read, as well as a license of mortmain,\r\nenabling the Society to hold revenues to the amount of £700 a year.\r\nThe ceremony was witnessed by a distinguished assembly, including the\r\nVice-Chancellor and Proctors, many Masters of Arts, a large company\r\nof the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood, and the Mayor,\r\nRecorder, and burgesses of Abingdon. Indeed, great and wide interest\r\nseems to have been taken in this youngest foundation, carrying on as\r\nit did the life of a very ancient and not unfamous place of academic\r\nlearning. The students of Broadgates were now the members of Pembroke,\r\nand the speeches on the day of the inauguration of the College still\r\naffectionately style them “Lateportenses.” A commission issued from\r\nthe Crown to the Lord Primate, the Visitor, the Vice-Chancellor, the\r\nMaster, the Recorder of Abingdon, Richard Wightwick, and Sir Eubule\r\nThelwall, to make statutes for the good government of the House. The\r\nstatutes provided that all the Fellows and scholars should proceed to\r\nthe degree of B.D. and seek Holy Orders. Some were to be of founders’\r\nkin, but, with this reservation, the double foundation was to be\r\nentirely for the benefit of Abingdon. These provisions have been for\r\nthe most part repealed by later statutes. But the tutorial Fellows are\r\nstill bound to celibacy.\r\n\r\nFurther additions were soon made to the original foundation. In 1636\r\nKing Charles I., who in that year visited Oxford “with no applause,”\r\ngave the College the patronage[322] of St. Aldate’s, which had been\r\nseized by the Crown on the dissolution of the religious houses. With\r\na view to raising the state of ecclesiastical learning in the Channel\r\nIslands, King Charles further founded a Fellowship, as also at Jesus\r\nCollege and Exeter, to be held by a native of Guernsey or Jersey.\r\nBishop Morley, in the next reign, bestowed five exhibitions for Channel\r\nislanders. A principal benefactor to this College was Sir J. Benet,\r\nLord Ossulstone. In 1714 Queen Anne annexed a prebend at Gloucester to\r\nthe Mastership. The Master, under the latest statutes, must be a person\r\ncapable in law of holding this stall. Other considerable benefactions\r\nhave from time to time been bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe new foundation, however, was not disposed to forego any portion of\r\nwhat it could claim. Savage, Master of Balliol, whose “Balliofergus”\r\n(1668) contains the account of the opening ceremony called “Natalitia\r\nCollegii Pembrochiani,” 1624, complains with pardonable resentment:\r\n“This rejeton had no sooner taken root than the Master and his company\r\ncalled the Master and Society of our Colledge into Chancery for the\r\nrestitution of the aforesaid £300” (the £300, viz. of Tesdale’s money\r\nwith which Cæsar’s Lodgings had been purchased). Wood says: “The\r\nmatter came before George [Abbot] Archbishop of Canterbury, sometime\r\nof Balliol College, who, knowing very well that the Society was not\r\nable at that time to repay the said sum, bade the fellows go home,\r\nbe obedient to their Governour, and JEHOVAH JIREH, _i. e._ GOD shall\r\nprovide for them. Whereupon he paid £50 of the said £300 presently, and\r\nfor the other £250 the College gave bond to be paid yearly by several\r\nsums till the full was satisfied. The which sums as they grew due did\r\nthe Lord Archbishop pay.” Abbot seems to have allowed the agreement\r\nbetween the Mayor and burgesses of Abingdon and Balliol. Yet his\r\nattitude towards Pembroke, in whose foundation he was concerned, was\r\none of marked benevolence. It is to be noted that Tesdale’s brass in\r\nGlympton Church, put up between his death and the new turn of affairs\r\nbrought about by Wightwick’s benefaction, describes him as “liberally\r\nbeneficial to Balliol Colledge in Oxford.” He is represented standing\r\non an ale-cask, in allusion to his trade as maltster. The alabaster\r\nmonument to Tesdale and Maud his wife was repaired in 1704, as a Latin\r\ninscription shows, by the Master and Fellows of Pembroke.\r\n\r\nPart of the founders’ money was laid out in building. Few Colleges\r\nstand within a more natural boundary of their own than Pembroke, and\r\nyet that boundary has only been completed within the last two years,\r\nand the College itself is an almost accidental agglomeration of ancient\r\ntenements. The south side stands directly on the city wall from South\r\nGate to Little Gate, looking down on a lane for a long time past called\r\nBrewer’s Street, but formerly Slaughter Lane, or Slaying Well Lane,\r\nKing Street, and also Lumbard[323] Lane. The western boundary of the\r\nCollege is Littlegate Street, the eastern St. Aldate’s Street (formerly\r\nFish Street), the northern Beef Lane and S. Aldate’s Church, though the\r\nCollege owns some interesting old houses on the south side of Pembroke\r\nStreet, formerly Crow Street and Pennyfarthing[324] Street. At the\r\ntime of the transformation of Broadgates Hall into Pembroke College,\r\nthe “Almshouses” opposite Christ Church Gate were an appendage to\r\nChrist Church. Then came the vacant strip of ground called “Hamel,”\r\nrunning north and south. Next on the west stood New College Chambers\r\nand Abingdon Buildings, which passed with Broadgates into Pembroke.\r\nBeckyngton, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was once Principal here. Further\r\nwest still stood Broadgates Hall, the sole part of which still\r\nremaining is the refectory, now the library. As depicted in the large\r\nAgas (1578) it seems to have been an irregular cluster of buildings\r\n(mostly rented), of which the largest was a double block called\r\nCambye’s, afterwards Summaster’s, Lodgings (vulgarly Veale Hall). This\r\nin 1626 was altered for the new Master’s Lodgings, but in 1695 it was\r\nreplaced by a six-gabled freestone pile, the outside of which was\r\nremodelled with the rest of the frontage in 1829, a storey being added\r\nlater by Dr. Jeune, afterwards Bishop of Peterborough. Loggan’s print\r\nshows the old building in 1675, and Burghersh gives its appearance in\r\n1700, as rebuilt by Bishop Hall.\r\n\r\nBroadgates Hall (except the refectory), together with Abingdon\r\nBuildings and New College Chambers, gave place, when Pembroke College\r\nhad been founded, to the present _Old Quadrangle_, of which the south\r\nand west sides and a portion of the east side were erected in 1624,\r\nthe remainder of the east side in 1670. Three years later the original\r\nnorth frontage, which had been merely repaired in 1624, was half pulled\r\ndown and replaced by “a fair fabrick of freestone.” The rest of the\r\nnorth front as far as the Common Gate was rebuilt by Michaelmas 1691,\r\nthe _Gate Tower_ in 1694, Sir John Benet supplying most of the cost.\r\nThis tower of 1694, the last part of the frontage to be built, was more\r\nclassical than the remainder. The tower shown in Loggan’s print (1675)\r\nin the _centre_ of the front can never have existed. Probably it was\r\nprojected only. A storey was added in 1829, when the exterior of the\r\nCollege was remodelled in the Gothic revival manner of George IV. The\r\ninterior of the quadrangle, though less altered than the outside, has\r\nlost much of its character by being refaced with inferior stone, and\r\nby the substitution of sashes for the quarried lights. Some changes\r\nwere made in the battlements and chimneys, and in the upper face of the\r\ntower by Mr. Bodley in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe history of the present _New Quadrangle_ is as follows: West of the\r\npresent Master’s lodging stood a number of ancient halls for legists,\r\nviz. Minote, Durham (later St. Michael’s) and St. James’ (these two\r\nin one) and Beef Halls. The last gives its name to Beef Lane. Dunstan\r\nHall, on the town wall, was (_temp._ Charles I.) pulled down, and\r\nthe whole space between the city wall and the “_Back Lodgings_,” as\r\nthe halls fringing Beef Lane were called, was divided into three\r\nenclosures. That furthest to the west became a garden for the Fellows,\r\nhaving a bowling alley, clipt walks and arbours,[325] and a curious\r\ndial. The middle enclosure was the Master’s garden, and here were shady\r\nbowers and a ball court. That nearest the College was a common garden;\r\nbut when the chapel was built in 1728 the pleasant borders probably got\r\ntrampled, and grass and trees were replaced by gravel. Such was, with\r\nlittle alteration, the aspect of the College till 1844. Two woodcuts\r\nin _Ingram_ (1837) show the picturesque old gabled Back Lodgings\r\nstill standing. But in 1844 Dr. Jeune took in hand the erection of\r\nnew buildings. The new hall and kitchens occupy the western side, and\r\nthe Fellows’ and undergraduates’ rooms the entire north side of the\r\n_Inner Quadrangle_ thus formed, a large plat of grass filling the\r\ncentral space, while the chapel and a tiny strip of private garden upon\r\nthe town wall form the south side. With the irregular range of old\r\nbuildings on the east, and especially when the luxuriant creepers dress\r\nthe walls with green and crimson, this is a very pleasing court, though\r\na visitor looking in casually through the outer gateway of the College\r\nmight hardly suspect its existence. Mr. Hayward of Exeter, nephew and\r\npupil of Sir C. Barry, was the architect. The _Hall_, built in 1848,\r\nis a much better example of the Gothic revival than a good many other\r\nOxford edifices, and the dark timbered roof is exceedingly handsome.\r\nThere is the usual large oriel on the daïs, a minstrels’ gallery, and\r\na great baronial fireplace, where huge blocks of fuel burn. As in the\r\nancient halls, the twin doors are faced by the buttery hatches, and the\r\nkitchen is below.\r\n\r\nThe time-honoured hall, much the oldest part of the College, and once\r\nthe refectory of Broadgates (the kitchen was in the S.W. corner of\r\nthe Old Quadrangle) was now made the College _Library_. The long room\r\nover Docklington’s aisle in St. Aldate’s was on the foundation of\r\nPembroke repaired at Dr. Clayton’s expense, and used once more for the\r\nreception of books presented by various donors, though Wood says that\r\nfor some years before the Great Rebellion it was partly employed for\r\nchambers. The books certainly were at first few. Francis Rous, one of\r\nCromwell’s “lords” and Speaker of the Little Parliament, who founded an\r\nExhibition, “did intend to give his whole Study, but being dissuaded\r\nto the contrary gave only his own works and some few others.” But in\r\n1709 Bishop Hall, Master of Pembroke, bequeathed his collection of\r\nbooks to the College, and a room was built over the hall to be the\r\nCollege library. When the hall became the library in 1848 this room,\r\nGothicized, was converted to a lecture-room. From 1709 the “chamber in\r\nSt. Aldate’s” was used no more, and this extremely ancient Civil Law\r\nSchool and picturesque feature of the church has now unhappily been\r\ndemolished. A Nuremburg Chronicle among Dr. Hall’s books is inscribed\r\nby Whitgift’s hand, and a volume of scholia on Aristotle has the\r\nautograph, “Is. Casaubonus.” Here also are Johnson’s deeply pathetic\r\n_Prayers and Meditations_, in his own writing.\r\n\r\nThe Pembroke library has recently been fortunate enough to acquire\r\nby gift from a lady to whom they were bequeathed[326] the unique\r\ncollection of Aristotelian and other works made by the late Professor\r\nChandler, Fellow of the College, and galleries were added last year\r\n(1890). The transverse portion of the room, which is shaped like\r\nthe letter T, was built in 1620 by Dr. Clayton, four years before\r\nBroadgates Hall became Pembroke College. A book of contributors (headed\r\n“Auspice Christo”) is extant, and has the signatures of Pym and of\r\n“Margaret Washington of Northants,” kinswoman of the famous Virginian.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, on the occasion of the “Bicentenary” of the College, when\r\nLatin speeches were delivered, the windows were enlarged and filled\r\nwith glass by Eginton, and the blazoned cornice added at a cost of\r\n£2000. But the room is the same one in which Johnson (whose bust by\r\nBacon is here) dined and abused the “coll,” or small beer, which he\r\nfound muddy and uninspiring to Latin themes--\r\n\r\n    “Carmina vis nostri scribant meliora poetae?\r\n    Ingenium jubeas purior haustus alat.”\r\n\r\nWhitfield carried about the liquor in leathern jacks here as he had\r\ndone in his mother’s inn at Gloucester. In this room they attended\r\nlectures. Every Nov. 5th there were speeches in the hall. “Johnson told\r\nme that when he made his first declamation he wrote over but one copy\r\nand that coarsely; and having given it into the hand of the tutor who\r\nstood to receive it as he passed was obliged to begin by chance and\r\ncontinue on how he could, for he had got but little of it by heart; so\r\nfairly trusting to his present powers for immediate supply he finished\r\nby adding astonishment to the applause of all who knew how little was\r\nowing to study” (Piozzi). We read of “a great Gaudy in the College,\r\nwhen the Master dined in public and the juniors (by an ancient custom\r\nthey were obliged to observe) went round the fire in the hall.” Johnson\r\ntold Warton, “In these halls the fireplace was anciently always in\r\nthe middle of the room till the Whigs removed it on one side.” At\r\ndinner till lately the signal for grace was given by three blows with\r\ntwo wooden trenchers, such as were used for bread and cheese till\r\n1848. Hearne laments, “when laudable old customs alter, ’tis a sign\r\nlearning dwindles.” There were four “College dinners” annually, one\r\nof which was an Oyster Feast.[327] The Manciple’s slate still hangs\r\nin this room. An undergraduates’ library has lately been established\r\n“between quads.” Where, by the bye, is Lobo’s _Voyage to Abyssinia_\r\n(the original of _Rasselas_) which Johnson borrowed from the Pembroke\r\nlibrary?\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that the students of Broadgates used\r\nDocklington’s aisle for divine service, and the aisle was rented for\r\nthis purpose by Pembroke College. The pulpit and Master’s pew are now\r\nat Stanton St. John’s. The present College chapel dates from 1728,\r\nthe year of Johnson’s matriculation. It was consecrated July 10th,\r\n1732, by Bishop Potter of Oxford, a sermon on religious vows and\r\ndedications being preached by “that fine Jacobite fellow” (as Johnson\r\ncalls him), Dr. Matthew Panting, then Master, from Gen. xxviii. 20-22.\r\nHearne styles him “an honest gent,” and says: “He had to preach the\r\nsermon at St. Mary’s on the day on which George Duke and Elector of\r\nBrunswick usurped the English throne; but his sermon took no notice,\r\nat most very little, of the Duke of Brunswick.” Bartholomew Tipping,\r\nEsq., whose arms are on the screen, contributed very largely towards\r\nbuilding the chapel. It was then “a neat Ionic structure,” plain\r\nand unpretending, but well proportioned and pleasing enough. The\r\npicture in the altar-piece was given at a later date by the Ven.\r\nJoseph Plymley (or Corbett), a gentleman commoner. It is a copy of\r\nour Lord’s figure in Rubens’ painting at Antwerp, “Christ urging\r\nSt. Theresa to succour a soul in Purgatory.” In 1884 the chapel was\r\nelaborately embellished and enriched at an expense of nearly £3000,\r\nso as to present one of the most beautiful interiors in Oxford. The\r\nwork was executed by Mr. C. E. Kempe, M.A., a member of the College.\r\nThe windows, in the Renaissance manner, are particularly fine. A\r\nquantity of silver and silver-gilt altar plate was presented at the\r\nsame time. The work is not yet finished, and a design for an organ\r\nremains on paper. It is worth recording that until twenty-seven years\r\nsince the Eucharist was administered here, as at the Cathedral and St.\r\nMary’s, to the communicants kneeling in their places. Johnson must,\r\nas an undergraduate, have attended St. Aldate’s (where the College\r\nworshipped once again for several terms during the recent decoration of\r\nthe chapel); but when in later years he visited Oxford, people flocked\r\nto Pembroke chapel[328] to gaze at the “great Cham of literature,”\r\nhumblest of worshippers, tenderest and most loyal of Pembroke’s sons.\r\n\r\nDean Burgon connects a bit of old Pembroke with Johnson. The summer\r\ncommon room behind the present hall was, before its demolition, the\r\nonly one left in Oxford, except that at Merton. He writes (1855):\r\n“This agreeable and picturesque apartment was in constant use within\r\nthe memory of the present Master; but, while I write, it is in a state\r\nof considerable decadence. The old chairs are drawn up against the\r\npanelled walls; on the small circular tables the stains produced by\r\nhot beverages are very plainly to be distinguished: only the guests\r\nare wanting, with their pipes and ale--their wigs and buckles--their\r\nbyegone manners and forgotten topics of discourse. It must have been\r\nhither that Dr. Adams, Master of Pembroke conducted Dr. Johnson and\r\nhis biographer in 1776, when the former after a rêverie of meditation\r\nexclaimed: ‘Ay, here I used to play at draughts with Phil Jones and\r\nFludyer. Jones loved beer, and did not get very forward in the Church.\r\nFludyer turned out a scoundrel, a Whig, and said he was ashamed of\r\nhaving been bred at Oxford.’” The old brazier, which Mr. Lang surmises\r\nWhitfield may have blacked, is, I believe, in existence.\r\n\r\nThe most important modern addition to the College is the Wolsey\r\nAlmshouse, purchased in 1888 from Christ Church for £10,000, by the\r\nhelp of money bequeathed by the Rev. C. Cleoburey. This is part of\r\n“Segrym’s houses,” held of St. Frideswyde’s Priory, and converted after\r\nthe Conquest into hostels “for people of a religious and scholastick\r\nconversation.” “With the decay of learning they came to be the\r\npossession of servants and retainers to the said priory.” They were\r\noccupied by Jas. Proctor when Wolsey converted them into a hospital;\r\nlater, Henry VIII. settled in them twenty-four almsmen, old soldiers,\r\nwith a yearly allowance of £6 each. Not long ago the bedesmen were\r\nsent to their homes with a pension, and the building became the\r\nChrist Church Treasurer’s lodging till it was heroically purchased by\r\nPembroke, which thus completed her “scientific frontier.” There is a\r\nfine timber roof here, said to have been brought from Osney Abbey. The\r\nbuilding has been a good deal altered. Skelton (1823) shows the south\r\npart of it in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe external history of Pembroke since its foundation in 1624 has\r\nbeen comparatively uneventful. When King Charles was besieged in\r\nOxford in 1642, like other Colleges it armed a company to defend\r\nthe city. Twice the loyal Colleges had given their cups and flagons\r\nfor their Sovereign’s necessities. Pembroke keeps the King’s letter\r\nof acknowledgment, with his signature. When the Parliamentary\r\nCommissioners visited Oxford in 1647, they ejected the then Master of\r\nPembroke, who had received them with these words: “I have seen your\r\ncommission and examined it. … I cannot with a safe conscience submit\r\nto it, nor without breach of oath made to my Sovereign, and breach of\r\noaths made to the University, and breach of oaths made to my College:\r\net sic habetis animi mei sententiam,--Henry Wightwicke.” Henry Langley,\r\nan intruded Canon of Christ Church, and “one of six Ministers appointed\r\nby Parliament to preach at St. Mary’s and elsewhere in Oxon to draw off\r\nthe Scholars from their orthodox principles,” was put in Wightwick’s\r\nroom, but removed in 1660. In 1650 “Honest Will Collier,” a Pembrokian,\r\nheads a plot to seize the Cromwellian garrison, and is “strangely\r\ntortured,” but his life spared.\r\n\r\nThe College pictures include a splendid Reynolds of Johnson,[329]\r\ngiven by Mr. A. Spottiswoode. Two interesting relics of Johnson are\r\nto be seen--the small deal desk on which he wrote the _Dictionary_,\r\nand his china teapot. It holds two quarts, for Johnson once drank\r\nfive-and-twenty cups at a sitting. He called himself “a hardened and\r\nshameless tea-drinker,” who “with tea amuses the evenings, with\r\ntea solaces the midnights, and with tea welcomes the mornings.” Peg\r\nWoffington made it for him “as red as blood.”\r\n\r\nPembroke since the seventeenth century has been a small College, though\r\nit has a large foundation of scholars. It has not been specially noted\r\nas either a “rich man’s” or a “poor man’s” College, and while winning\r\nat least its fair share of distinction in the schools, it has been\r\nknown perhaps chiefly as a compact, pleasant, and not uncomfortable\r\nSociety, whose Promus no longer serves “muddy” beer, and whose Coquus\r\nno Latin verses satirize. There is a handsome show of plate. It\r\nincludes several silver “tumblers” or “tuns,” which when placed on\r\ntheir side tumble upright again, and a large hammered tankard (lately\r\npresented) with the “Britannia” mark, and made after the ancient manner\r\nwith pegs between its thirteen pints to measure the draught to be\r\ntaken. The oldest inscribed piece of plate is dated 1653. Pembroke has\r\nbeen usually a rowing College. The Eight was Head of the River in 1872;\r\nthe Torpid in 1877, 1878, and 1879, the Eight then being second. The\r\n“Christ Church Fours” are rowed every year for a challenge goblet given\r\nby the Christ Church Club in gratitude for an eight lent by Pembroke\r\nin a time of need. The racing colours are cherry and white, with the\r\nred rose for badge of the Eight and the thistle of the Torpid.[330]\r\nThe “Junior Common Room” is the oldest of undergraduate wine clubs.\r\nThere is a flourishing and old-established literary club called the\r\n“Johnson,” and there is of course a Debating and a Musical Society.\r\nThe Master, Fellows, and Scholars of Pembroke are patrons of eight\r\nbenefices. College meetings are called Conventions.\r\n\r\nA few names may be cited from the roll of (Broadgates and) Pembroke\r\nworthies--\r\n\r\n_Edmund Bonner_, “Scholar enough and tyrant too much” (Fuller),\r\nentered Broadgates in 1512. In 1519 he became Bachelor of Canon and\r\nCivil Law; D.C.L. 1535. He was successively Bishop of Hereford and\r\nof London, but was deprived and imprisoned under Edward VI. Having\r\nbeen restored by Mary, on Elizabeth’s accession he refused the oath\r\nof the Supremacy, and was committed to the Marshalsea, where he\r\ndied September 5th, 1569. _Thomas Yonge_, Archbishop of York, 1560.\r\n_John Moore_, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1783, began as a servitor at\r\nPembroke. The Duke of Marlborough had then a house in Oxford, and\r\nwalking with Dr. Adams one day in the street, asked him to recommend\r\na governor for his son, Lord Blandford. Dr. Adams in reply pointed to\r\nthe slight figure of a lad walking just in front, and said, “That is\r\nthe person I recommend.” The Duke afterwards brought Moore’s merits\r\nunder the notice of the King, who placed the Prince of Wales under his\r\ncare, which led to his ecclesiastical elevation. _William Newcome_,\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, 1795. The primatial sees of Canterbury, York, and\r\nArmagh have thus each been filled from Broadgates or Pembroke. _John\r\nHeywoode_, “the Epigrammatist,” one of the earliest English dramatic\r\nwriters. While attached to the Court of Henry VIII. he wrote those six\r\ncomedies which are among the first innovations upon the mysteries and\r\nmiracle-plays of the middle age, and which laid the foundation of the\r\nsecular comedy in this country. His _Interludes_, in which the clergy\r\nare satirized, are earlier than 1521. Yet he was favoured by Mary\r\nTudor, and was also the friend of Sir Thomas More. _George Peele_,\r\ndramatist. _Charles Fitzjeffrey_, 1572, “the poet of Broadgates Hall”\r\n(Wood). _David Baker_, entered 1590, a Benedictine monk, historian,\r\nand mystical writer, author of the _Chronicle_. _Francis Beaumont_,\r\nthe poet, entered February 4th, 1596, as “Baronis filius æt. 12.” His\r\nfather dying April 21st, 1598, he left without a degree. His elder\r\nbrother, _Sir John Beaumont_, entered Broadgates the same day. He\r\nwas a Puritan in religion, but fought on the Cavalier side. _William\r\nCamden_, the antiquary, called “the Strabo of England,” entered 1567,\r\naged sixteen; Clarencieux King of Arms; Head-master of Westminster. He\r\ndied 1623. The Latin grace composed by Camden to be said after meat\r\nin Broadgates Hall is still in use at Pembroke. In 1599 entered _John\r\nPym_, the politician, aged fifteen. Among the contributors to the\r\nenlargement of the Hall in 1620 his signature appears, “Johannes pym\r\nde Brimont in com. Somerset quondam Aulae Lateportensis Commensalis.\r\n44/. Jo. Pym.” _Sir Thomas Browne_, author of that delightful\r\nbook _Religio Medici_, the quaint thought of which inspired Elia.\r\nHe entered as Fellow Commoner in 1623. His body lies in St. Peter\r\nMancroft, Norwich. When it was disentombed in 1840 the fine auburn\r\nhair had not lost its freshness. _Matthew Turner_, one of the first\r\nFellows, who wrote all his sermons in Greek. It will be remembered\r\nthat, not many years before, Queen Elizabeth had received an address\r\nin Oxford, and _replied_ to it, in this learned tongue, and that in\r\nthe period of Puritan ascendancy (1648-1659) the disputations in the\r\nschools for M.A. were often in Greek. Other worthies of this House\r\nare Cardinal _Repyngdon_, the Wycliffist; _John Storie_, whose career\r\nclosed at Tyburn; _Thomas Randolph_, constantly employed by Elizabeth\r\non important embassies; _Timothy Hall_, one of the few London clergy\r\nwho read James II.’s Declaration. He was made Bishop of Oxford, but in\r\nhis palace found himself alone, hated, and shunned; _Carew_, Earl of\r\nTotnes; _Peter Smart_, Puritan poet, Cosin’s assailant; Chief Justice\r\n_Dyer_; Lord Chancellor _Harcourt_; _Collier_, the metaphysician;\r\n_Southern_, the Restoration dramatist; _Durel_, the Biblical critic;\r\n_Henderson_, “the Irish Creichton”; _Davies Gilbert_, President of\r\nthe Royal Society; _Richard Valpy_; _John Lemprière_; _Thomas Stock_,\r\nco-founder of the Sunday School system.\r\n\r\nIn 1694, Prideaux (whom Aldrich sets down as “muddy-headed”) calls\r\nPembroke “the fittest colledge in the town for brutes.” But a Mr.\r\nLapthorne, twenty years later, gives a different picture of it. “I\r\nhave placed my son in Pembroke Colledge. The house, though it bee\r\nbut a little one, yet is reputed to be one of the best for sobriety\r\nand order.” It is not till the Georgian time, however, that we\r\nget a distinct view of the inner life of Pembroke--the time when\r\nShenstone, Blackstone, Graves, Hawkins, Whitfield, and--towering above\r\nall--Johnson, were contemporary or nearly contemporary here.\r\n\r\n_Samuel Johnson_ entered as a Commoner October 31st, 1728, aged\r\nnineteen. Old Michael Johnson anxiously introduced him to Mr. Jorden,\r\nhis tutor. “He seemed very full of the merits of his son, and told the\r\ncompany he was a good scholar and a poet, and wrote Latin verses. His\r\nfigure and manner appeared strange to them; but he behaved modestly,\r\nand sate silent, till, upon something which occurred in the course\r\nof conversation, he struck in and quoted Macrobius.” Johnson told\r\nBoswell that Jorden was “a very worthy man, but a heavy man.” He\r\ntold Mrs. Thrale that “when he was first entered at the University\r\nhe passed a morning, in compliance with the customs of the place, at\r\nhis tutor’s chamber; but, finding him no scholar, went no more. In\r\nabout ten days after, meeting Mr. Jorden in the street, he offered to\r\npass without saluting him; but the tutor stopped and enquired, not\r\nroughly neither, what he had been doing? ‘Sliding on the ice,’ was\r\nthe reply; and so turned away with disdain. He laughed very heartily\r\nat the recollection of his own insolence, and said they endured it\r\nfrom him with a gentleness that whenever he thought of it astonished\r\nhimself.” Once, being fined for non-attendance, he rudely retorted,\r\n“Sir, you have sconced me twopence for a lecture not worth a penny.”\r\nDr. Adams, however, told Boswell that Johnson attended his tutor’s\r\nlectures and those given in the Hall very regularly. Jorden quite won\r\nhis heart. “That creature would defend his pupils to the last; no young\r\nlad under his care should suffer for committing slight irregularities,\r\nwhile he had breath to defend or power to protect them. If I had sons\r\nto send to College, Jorden should have been their tutor” (Piozzi).\r\nAgain, “Whenever a young man becomes Jorden’s pupil he becomes his\r\nson.” Still, when Johnson’s intimate, Taylor, was about to join him at\r\nPembroke, he persuaded him to go to Christ Church, where the lectures\r\nwere excellent. In going to get Taylor’s lecture notes at second-hand,\r\nJohnson saw that his ragged shoes were noticed by the Christ Church\r\nmen, and came no more. He was too proud to accept money, and, some\r\nkind hand having placed a pair of new shoes at his door, Johnson, when\r\nhis short-sighted vision spied them, flung them passionately away. His\r\nroom was a very small one in the second storey over the gateway; it is\r\npractically unaltered.\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” wrote Bishop Percy, “from some of his contemporaries,\r\nthat he was generally to be seen lounging at the College gate with a\r\ncircle of young students round him, whom he was entertaining with wit\r\nand keeping from their studies, if not spiriting them up to rebellion\r\nagainst the College discipline, which in his maturer years he so much\r\nextolled. He would not let these idlers say ‘prodigious,’ or otherwise\r\nmisuse the English tongue.” “Even then, Sir, he was delicate in\r\nlanguage, and we all feared him.” So Edwards, an old fellow-collegian\r\nof Johnson’s, told Boswell half a century later. Johnson, hearing\r\nfrom Edwards that a gentleman had left his whole fortune to Pembroke,\r\ndiscussed the ethics of legacies to Colleges. Edwards has given us\r\na saying we would not willingly lose: “You are a philosopher, Dr.\r\nJohnson. I have tried too in my time to be a philosopher; but, I don’t\r\nknow how, cheerfulness was always breaking in.” Johnson remembered\r\ndrinking with Edwards at an alehouse near Pembroke-gate. Their meeting\r\nagain, after fifty years spent by both in London, Johnson accounted one\r\nof the most curious incidents of his life.\r\n\r\nDr. Adams told Boswell that Johnson while at Pembroke was caressed and\r\nloved by all about him, was a gay and frolicsome fellow, and passed\r\nthere the happiest part of his life. “When I mentioned to him this\r\naccount he said, ‘Ah, sir, I was mad and violent. It was bitterness\r\nwhich they mistook for frolick. I was miserably poor, and I thought to\r\nfight my way by my literature and my wit; so I disregarded all power\r\nand all authority.’” Bishop Percy told Boswell, “The pleasure he took\r\nin vexing the tutors and fellows has been often mentioned. But I have\r\nheard him say that the mild but judicious expostulations of this worthy\r\nman [Dr. Adams, then a junior Fellow] whose virtue awed him and whose\r\nlearning he revered, made him really ashamed of himself: ‘though I\r\nfear,’ said he, ‘I was too proud to own it.’” Johnson was transferred\r\nfrom Jorden to Adams, who said to Boswell, “I was his nominal tutor,\r\nbut he was above my mark.” When Johnson heard this remark, his eyes\r\nflashed with satisfaction. “That was liberal and noble,” he exclaimed.\r\nJorden once gave him for a Christmas exercise Pope’s “Messiah” to turn\r\ninto Latin verse, which the veteran saw and was pleased to commend\r\nhighly.\r\n\r\nCarlyle has drawn a fancy picture of the rough, seamy-faced, rawboned\r\nservitor starving in view of the empty or locked buttery. Dr. Birkbeck\r\nHill has shown that though Johnson was poor, he lived like other men.\r\nHis batells came to about eight shillings a week. Even Mr. Leslie\r\nStephen introduces the usual talk about “servitors and sizars.”\r\nJohnson was not a servitor. “It was the practice for a servitor, by\r\norder of the Master, to go round to the rooms of the young men, and,\r\nknocking[331] at the door, to enquire if they were within, and if no\r\nanswer was returned to report them absent. Johnson could not endure\r\nthis intrusion, and would frequently be silent when the utterance of a\r\nword would have ensured him from censure, and … would join with others\r\nof the young men in hunting, as they called it, the servitor who was\r\nthus diligent in his duty; and this they did with the noise of pots and\r\ncandlesticks, singing to the tune of ‘Chevy Chase’ the words of that\r\nold ballad--\r\n\r\n    ‘To drive the deer with hound and horn.’”\r\n\r\nAny one who has occupied the narrow tower staircase can imagine the\r\nnoise of Johnson’s ponderous form tumbling down it in hot pursuit. The\r\npresent balusters must be the same as those he clutched in his headlong\r\ndescents one hundred and sixty years ago. Amid this boisterousness he\r\nread with deep attention Law’s racy and masculine book, the _Serious\r\nCall_.\r\n\r\nDr. Hill has examined exhaustively the difficult question of the length\r\nof Johnson’s residence, and proved that the fourteen months, to which\r\nthe batell books testify, was the whole of his Oxford career. He was\r\nabsent for but one week in the Long Vacation of 1729. He ceased to\r\nreside in December, 1729, and removed his name from the books October\r\n8th, 1731, without taking his degree, his caution money (£7) cancelling\r\nhis undischarged batells. But, his contemporaries assure us, “he had\r\ncontracted a love and regard for Pembroke College, which he retained to\r\nthe last.” It has been thought that the College helped him pecuniarily.\r\nHe loved it none the less that it was reputed a Jacobitical place.\r\nIn his _Life of Sir T. Browne_ he speaks of “the zeal and gratitude\r\nof those that love it.” Whenever he visited Oxford in after days he\r\nwould go and see his College before doing anything else. Warton was\r\nhis companion in 1754. Johnson was highly pleased to find all the\r\nCollege servants of his time still remaining, particularly a very old\r\nmanciple, and to be recognized by them. But he was coldly received when\r\nhe waited on the Master, Dr. Radcliffe, who did not ask him to dinner,\r\nand did not care to talk about the forthcoming Dictionary. However,\r\nthere was a cordial meeting with his old rival Meeke, now a Fellow.\r\nAt the classical lecture in hall Johnson had fretted under Meeke’s\r\nsuperiority, he told Warton, and tried to sit out of earshot of his\r\nconstruing. Besides Meeke, it seems, there was at this time only one\r\nother resident Fellow. Boswell describes other visits, when Dr. Adams,\r\nJohnson’s lifelong friend, was Master. He prided himself on being\r\naccurately academic, and wore his gown ostentatiously. The following\r\nletter from Hannah More to her sister is dated Oxford, June 13th,\r\n1782:--\r\n\r\n“Who do you think is my principal cicerone in Oxford? Only Dr. Johnson!\r\nAnd we do so gallant it about! You cannot imagine with what delight he\r\nshowed me every part of his own College (Pembroke), nor how rejoiced\r\nHenderson looked to make one of the party. Dr. Adams had contrived a\r\nvery pretty piece of gallantry. We spent the day and evening at his\r\nhouse. After dinner Johnson begged to conduct me to see the College;\r\nhe would let no one show it me but himself. ‘This was my room; this\r\nShenstone’s.’ Then, after pointing out all the rooms of the poets\r\nwho had been of his College, ‘In short,’ said he, ‘we were a nest of\r\nsinging birds. Here we walked, there we played at cricket.’ He ran over\r\nwith pleasure the history of the juvenile days he passed there. When\r\nwe came into the common room we spied a fine large print of Johnson,\r\nframed and hung up that very morning, with this motto, ‘And is not\r\nJohnson ours, himself a host?’ under which stared you in the face,\r\n‘From Miss More’s Sensibility.’ This little incident amused us; but\r\nalas! Johnson looked very ill indeed; spiritless and wan. However he\r\nmade an effort to be cheerful, and I exerted myself to make him so.”\r\n\r\nA few months before his death, his ebbing strength beginning to return,\r\nhe had a wistful desire to see Oxford and Pembroke once again, and,\r\nweary as he was with the journey, revived[332] in spirit as the coach\r\ndrew near the ancient city. He presented all his works to the College\r\nlibrary, and had thoughts of bequeathing his house at Lichfield to the\r\nCollege, but he was reminded of the claims of some poor relatives. “He\r\ntook a pleasure,” Boswell says, “in boasting of the many eminent men\r\nwho had been educated at Pembroke.”\r\n\r\n_Shenstone_, the poet, entered Pembroke in 1732, after Johnson had\r\nleft. Burns says: “His divine Elegies do honour to our language,\r\nour nation, and our species.” Johnson writes: “Here it appears he\r\nfound delight and advantage; for he continued his name in the book\r\nten years, though he took no degree. After the first four years he\r\nput on the civilian’s gown.” _Hawkins_, Professor of Poetry. _Rev.\r\nRichard Graves_, junior, admitted scholar, November, 1732--poet and\r\nnovelist. He was the author of the _Spiritual Quixote_, a satire on the\r\nMethodists. He tells us: “Having brought with me the character of a\r\ntolerably good Grecian, I was invited to a very sober little party, who\r\namused themselves in the evening with reading Greek and drinking water.\r\nHere I continued six months, and we read over Theophrastus, Epictetus,\r\nPhalaris’ Epistles, and such other Greek authors as are seldom read at\r\nschool. But I was at length seduced from this mortified symposium to a\r\nvery different party, a set of jolly, sprightly young fellows, most of\r\nthem West country lads, who drank ale, smoked tobacco, punned, and sang\r\nbacchanalian catches the whole evening.… I own with shame that, being\r\nthen not seventeen, I was so far captivated with the social disposition\r\nof these young people (many of whom were ingenuous lads and good\r\nscholars), that I began to think them the only wise men. Some gentlemen\r\ncommoners, however, who considered the above-mentioned a very _low_\r\ncompany (chiefly on account of the liquor they drank), good-naturedly\r\ninvited me to their party; they treated me with port wine and arrack\r\npunch; and now and then, when they had drunk so much as hardly to\r\ndistinguish wine from water, they would conclude with a bottle or\r\ntwo of claret. They kept late hours, drank their favourite toasts on\r\ntheir knees, and in short were what were then called ‘bucks of the\r\nfirst head.’ … There was, besides, a sort of flying squadron of plain,\r\nsensible, matter-of-fact men, confined to no club, but associating with\r\neach party. They anxiously inquired after the news of the day and the\r\npolitics of the times. They had come to the University on their way to\r\nthe Temple, or to get a slight smattering of the sciences before they\r\nsettled in the country.” Graves breakfasts with Shenstone (who wore his\r\nown hair), a Mr. Whistler being of the company. This was “a young man\r\nof great delicacy of sentiment, but with such a dislike to languages\r\nthat he is unable to read the classics in the original, yet no one\r\nformed a better judgment of them. He wrote, moreover, a great part of a\r\ntragedy on the story of Dido.” In a later day we may surmise this young\r\ngentleman of delicacy of sentiment would have written a Newdigate. The\r\nthree friends often met and discussed plays and poetry, Spectators or\r\nTatlers.\r\n\r\n_George Whitfield_ entered as a servitor, November, 1732. An old\r\nschoolfellow, himself a Pembroke servitor, happened to visit\r\nWhitfield’s mother, who kept a hostelry in Gloucester, and told her\r\nhow he had not only discharged his College expenses for the term, but\r\nhad received a penny. At this the good ale-wife cried out, “That will\r\ndo for my son. Will you go to Oxford, George?” “With all my heart,” he\r\nreplied. He tells us that at College he was solicited to join in excess\r\nof riot with several who lay in the same room; but God gave him grace\r\nto withstand them. His tutor was kind, but when he joined Wesley’s\r\nsmall set he met with harshness from the Master, who frequently chid\r\nhim and even threatened to expel him. “I had no sooner received the\r\nSacrament publickly on a week-day at St. Mary’s, but I was set up as a\r\nmark for all the polite students that knew me to shoot at. … I daily\r\nunderwent some contempt from the collegians. Some have thrown dirt at\r\nme, and others took away their pay from me.” Johnson told Boswell that\r\nhe was at Pembroke with Whitfield, and “knew him before he began to\r\nbe better than other people” (smiling). But they cannot have been in\r\nresidence together, nor can Whitfield have been “chevied” by Johnson\r\nto the accompaniment of candlestick and pan.\r\n\r\nTo the pictures of Pembroke life supplied by Graves and Whitfield, Dr.\r\nBirkbeck Hill adds a sketch of a gentleman commoner of this time. Mr.\r\nErasmus Philipps, of Picton Castle, (afterwards fifth baronet), entered\r\nin 1720. He is a youth of fashion, but not, as he would probably be in\r\nthe present day, a dunce and a fool. He attends the races on Port Mead,\r\nwhere the running of Lord Tracey’s mare Whimsey, the swiftest galloper\r\nin England, brings to his mind the description in Job. He goes to see\r\na foot-race between tailors for geese, and another day to see a great\r\ncock-match in Holywell between the Earl of Plymouth and the town cocks,\r\nwhich beat his lordship. He attends the ball at the “Angel”--a guinea\r\ntouch--and gives a private ball in honour of the fair Miss Brigandine.\r\nHe writes an Essay on Friendship set him by his tutor, who the same\r\nevening goes with the young man to Godstow by water with some others,\r\ntaking music and wine. Or he attends a poetical club at the “Tuns,”\r\nwith Mr. Tristram,[333] another of the Fellows, drinks Gallician wine\r\nthere, and is entertained with two masterly fables of Dr. Evans’\r\ncomposition. Pembrokians meet at the “Tuns” to motto, epigrammatize,\r\netc. Mr. Philipps has literary tastes and attends the Encaenia, not to\r\nmake a poor noise, but to criticize the Proctor’s oration. He presents\r\na curious book to the Bodleian, and Mr. Prior’s works in folio to the\r\nPembroke library. He cultivates the society of men of learning and\r\ntaste, among them an Arabic scholar from Damascus. “On leaving Pembroke\r\nhe presented one of the scholars with his key of the garden, for which\r\nhe had on entrance paid ten shillings, treated the whole College in the\r\nCommon Room, and then took up his Caution money (£10) from the bursar\r\nand lodged it with the Master for the use of Pembroke College.”\r\n\r\nWhen Graves went to All Souls as Fellow (which many Pembroke students\r\nof law did), his friend Blackstone went with him. _Sir William\r\nBlackstone_, the great jurist, entered in 1738, aged fifteen. He is\r\nburied at Wallingford.\r\n\r\nWestminster Abbey has received the ashes of at least four members of\r\nthis House, viz. Francis Beaumont and his brother Sir John, Pym the\r\nparliamentarian, and Johnson the champion of authority. Pym’s body was\r\ncast out at the Restoration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Nisi Dominus aedificaverit Domum in vanum laboraverunt qui aedificant\r\neam._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nWORCESTER COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. C. H. O. DANIEL, M.A., FELLOW OF WORCESTER COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gloucester College_, 1283-1539.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the history of Gloucester College anticipate by nine\r\nyears the establishment of Merton College upon its present site and\r\nunder statutes which had assumed their final shape, by three years\r\nthe code of rules drawn up by the University for the University Hall,\r\nand by one year the date of the statutes of Balliol College, statutes\r\nwhich preceded the establishment of students upon the present site of\r\nthat College. It was in 1283 that John Giffarde, Baron of Brimsfield,\r\non St. John the Evangelist’s day, being present in St. Peter’s Abbey\r\nat Gloucester, founded Gloucester College, “extra muros Oxoniæ,” as\r\na house of study for thirteen monks of that abbey, appropriating for\r\ntheir support the revenues of the church of Chipping Norton. This was\r\nthe first monastic College established in Oxford. It differed from the\r\nHall which not long after was built for the Benedictines of Durham,\r\nin that, while Durham College admitted secular students, Gloucester\r\nCollege was limited to monks of the Benedictine Order. It was not long\r\nbefore the other great English Benedictine Houses, whose students\r\nwhen sent to Oxford had hitherto been placed in scattered lodgings,\r\nrecognized the advantage of bringing them together under common\r\ndiscipline and instruction and a common Head. They obtained permission\r\ntherefore of the Abbey of Gloucester to share with them their house at\r\nOxford, and to add to the existing buildings several lodgings, each\r\nappropriated to the use of one or more of the Benedictine Houses. The\r\nbuilding made over in the first place by Giffarde had been originally\r\nthe mansion of Gilbert Clare earl of Gloucester, for whom it had the\r\nadvantage of being close to the Royal palace of Beaumont, in Magdalen\r\nParish. His arms were in Antony Wood’s day still to be seen “fairly\r\ndepicted in the window of the Common Hall.” It subsequently passed into\r\nthe hands of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, and was exempt\r\nfrom Episcopal and archidiaconal jurisdiction “a tempore cujus memoria\r\nnon existit.” It was from the Hospitallers that Giffarde bought the\r\nhouse which he made over to Gloucester Abbey. In 1290 or 1291, upon\r\nthe agreement to admit other Benedictine Houses to a joint use of the\r\nCollege, the founder purchased four other tenements, and, obtaining a\r\nlicense in mortmain from Edward I., conveyed the whole to the Prior and\r\nmonks. Thereupon was held at Abingdon a General Chapter of the Abbots\r\nand Priors of the Order, at which provisions were made for regulating\r\nthe new buildings to be erected and for providing contributions towards\r\nthe expenses, while rules were drawn up for the conduct of the College.\r\nAll Benedictines of the Province of Canterbury were to have right\r\nof admission to “our common House in Stockwell Street,” and all the\r\nstudents were to have an equal vote in the election of the Prior. The\r\nstrife and canvassing which took place over these popular elections\r\nin time arose to such a head as to create a scandal in the order, to\r\nremedy which it was decreed by a General Chapter that the author of\r\nany such disturbance should be punished by degradation and perpetual\r\nexcommunication. The monks themselves, differing in this respect from\r\nthe subsequent foundation of Durham College, were not permitted to\r\nstudy or be conversant with secular students; they were bound to attend\r\ndivine service on solemn and festival days; to observe disputations\r\nconstantly in term-time; to have divinity disputations once a week,\r\nand the presiding moderator was endowed with a salary of £10 per annum\r\nout of the common stock of the Order, which provided also for the\r\nexpenses of their Exercises and Degrees in the matter of fees and\r\nentertainments. It was the duty of the Prior to enforce all regulations\r\nand to see that the monks preached often, as well in the Latin as in\r\nthe vulgar tongue. It was further jealously stipulated that in their\r\nexercises they should “answer” under one of their own Order, a trace\r\nof the struggle between the religious orders and the University which\r\narose to such a height in the case of the various orders of Friars.\r\n\r\nFew structures carry their history and their purpose upon their face in\r\na more obvious or more picturesque manner than do the still surviving\r\nremains of the old Benedictine colony. Each settlement possessed a\r\nlodging of its own “divided (though all for the most part adjoining\r\nto each other) by particular roofs, partitions, and various forms of\r\nstructure, and known from each other, like so many colonies and tribes,\r\n(though one at once inhabited by several abbies,) by arms and rebuses\r\nthat are depicted and cut in stone over each door.” These words of\r\nAntony à Wood are a perfect description of the cottage-like row of\r\ntenements which still form the south side of the present quadrangle,\r\nand partially apply to the small southern quadrangle, though many of\r\nthe features have been in this case obliterated. But on the north side\r\nall that now remains of what is represented in Loggan’s well-known\r\nprint is the ancient doorway of the College, surmounted by two shields,\r\n(there used to be three, bearing respectively the arms of Gloucester,\r\nGlastonbury and St. Alban’s,) and the adjoining buildings, which are\r\nof the same character as the tenements on the south side. The first\r\nlodgings on the north side were allotted, we are told, to the monks of\r\nAbingdon: the next were built for the monks of Gloucester. These in\r\nlater days became the lodgings of the Principal of Gloucester Hall,\r\nan arrangement followed in the position of the present lodgings of\r\nthe Provost of the College. On the five lodgings of the south side\r\none may see still in place the shields described by A. Wood. Over the\r\ndoor at the S.W. corner is a shield bearing a mitre over a comb and a\r\ntun, with the letter W (interpreted as the rebus of Walter Compton, or\r\nelse in reference to Winchcombe Abbey). Another shield bears three\r\ncups surmounted by a ducal coronet. Between these is a small niche.\r\nThe chambers next in order were assigned by tradition to Westminster\r\nAbbey; and the central lodgings of the five were “partly for Ramsey and\r\nWinchcombe Abbies.” Over the doors of the easternmost lodgings again\r\nare shields, the first bearing a “griffin sergreant,” the other a plain\r\ncross. Another plain shield remains _in situ_ in the small quadrangle;\r\none has been removed and built into the garden wall of the present\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nA. Wood gives a list of the abbies which sent their monks to Gloucester\r\nCollege. These were Gloucester, Glastonbury, St. Alban’s, Tavistock,\r\nBurton, Chertsey, Coventry, Evesham, Eynsham, St. Edmondsbury,\r\nWinchcombe, Abbotsbury, Michelney, Malmesbury, Rochester, Norwich. It\r\nmay be presumed that other Houses of the Order made use of the place,\r\namong those whose representatives were present at the Chapter held at\r\nSalisbury the day after the interment of Queen Eleanor, 1291, when\r\nthe Prior for the time being, Henry de Helm, was invested with the\r\ngovernment of the College, and provision was made for the election of\r\nhis successor.\r\n\r\nWe do not at this early date find any mention of Refectory or Chapel.\r\nThe parish church was, no doubt, as in other cases, frequented by the\r\nstudent-monks for divine services, but they also had licence to have\r\na portable altar. It was not till 1420, in the prioralty of Thomas de\r\nLedbury, that John Whethamsted, Abbot of St. Alban’s, formerly Prior,\r\ncontributed largely to the erection of a chapel, which stood upon the\r\nsite of the present chapel. Its ruins are figured in Loggan’s sketch.\r\nHe built also a Library on the south side of the chapel, at right\r\nangles to it, the five windows of which, giving upon Stockwell Street,\r\nare also depicted in Loggan’s sketch. Upon this Library he bestowed\r\nmany books both of his own collection and of his own writing; and at\r\nhis instance Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, besides other benefactions,\r\ngave many books to the Library. The benefits conferred by Whethamsted\r\nwere such that a Convocation of the Order styled him “chief benefactor\r\nand second founder of the College.” One other name, a name of local\r\ninterest, we find associated with the place as its benefactor--that of\r\nSir Peter Besils, of Abingdon. Thus a century of dignified prosperity\r\nwas assured to the College, during which period it numbered among its\r\n_alumni_ John Langden, Bishop of Rochester; Thomas Mylling, Abbot of\r\nWestminster and afterwards Bishop of Hereford; Antony Richer, Abbot\r\nof Eynsham, afterwards Bishop of Llandaff; Thomas Walsingham the\r\nchronicler.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the monasteries of course involved the suppression\r\nof the Benedictine College; Whethamsted’s Chapel and Library were\r\nreduced to a ruin; and the books “were partly lost and purchased, and\r\npartly conveyed to some of the other College Libraries,” where Wood\r\nprofesses to have seen them “still bearing their donor’s name.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop of Oxford’s Palace_, 1542-1557(?).\r\n\r\nThe College, its buildings and grounds, remained in the hands of the\r\nCrown till the thirty-fourth year of Henry’s reign, when, upon his\r\nfounding the Bishoprick of Oxford, the seat of which was at Osney,\r\nit was allotted to the Bishop for his palace, and was for a certain\r\ntime occupied by Bishop King, who had been the last Abbot of Osney.\r\nOn the transfer of the See within three years to the church of St.\r\nFrideswyde, the endowments which had been attached to the Bishoprick\r\nand temporarily resigned to the Crown were conveyed to the new\r\nfoundation, the intention of Henry VIII., who had died in the meantime,\r\nbeing carried out by Edward VI. But there is no mention among the\r\nendowments thus re-conveyed of Gloucester College, which remained in\r\nthe possession of the Crown until it was granted by Elizabeth, in the\r\nsecond year of her reign, to William Doddington. He at once made it\r\nover to the newly-founded College of St. John Baptist, for whom it was\r\npurchased by the founder. The legend runs that Sir Thomas Whyte was\r\ninclined for a while to Gloucester Hall as the site of his new College,\r\nbut that a dream directed him to the selection of St. Bernard’s College.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Oxford in 1604 revived his claim to the Hall, maintaining\r\nthat the surrender to the Crown had not been acknowledged by Bishop\r\nKing, nor duly enrolled in Chancery, and to try his rights he “did\r\nmake an entry by night and by water, and did drive away the horses\r\ndepasturing on the land belonging to the said Hall.” He failed however\r\nto make good his claim against St. John’s College.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gloucester Hall_, 1559-1714.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Whyte effected considerable repairs in his new purchase, and\r\nconverted it into a Hall with the name of the Principal and Scholars of\r\nSt. John Baptist’s Hall: the Principal was to be a Fellow of St. John’s\r\nCollege, elected by that Society and admitted by the Chancellor of\r\nthe University. On St. John Baptist’s day, 1560, the first Principal,\r\nWilliam Stock, and one hundred Scholars took their first commons in\r\nthe old monks’ Refectory. It was in the September of this same year\r\nthat the body of Amy Robsart, Robert Dudley’s ill-fated wife, was\r\nsecretly brought from Cumnor to Gloucester College, and lay there\r\ntill the burial at St. Mary’s, “the great chamber where the mourners\r\ndid dine, and that where the gentlewomen did dine, and beneath the\r\nstairs a great hall being all hung with black cloth, and garnished\r\nwith scutcheons.”[334] Before long the patronage of this Hall passed\r\nwith that of others into the hands of the Chancellor, this same Robert\r\nDudley, then become Earl of Leicester, so that the restriction to\r\nFellows of St. John’s College was no longer observed.\r\n\r\nThere are but few notices of the Hall to be found in the Register of\r\nSt. John’s College. Under date 1567 there is entry of the lease of a\r\nchamber, formerly the Library, to William Stocke, Principal of the\r\nHall. In 1573 it was ordered that at the election of a Principal to\r\nsucceed Mr. Stocke it be covenanted that Sir Geo. Peckham may quietly\r\nenjoy his lodging there. And again in 1608 there is entered a grant of\r\nsix timber trees out of Bagley Wood towards building a chapel. This was\r\nin the principalship of Dr. Hawley, in whose time it was that the old\r\nHall for a second time, if the legend of Sir Thomas Whyte be credited,\r\nwon the regard of an intending Founder; Nicholas Wadham selected it as\r\nthe site of his projected College, and his widow, Dorothy, sought to\r\ncarry out his intention, and purchase it. But the scheme went off; for\r\nthe Principal, Dr. Hawley, refused to resign his interest in the Hall,\r\nexcept upon the Foundress naming him as the first Warden of her College.\r\n\r\nIn Principal Hawley’s time it may be inferred that the Hall was\r\nat a low ebb in point of numbers; but among its students was one\r\nwhose quaint, adventurous career had its fit commencement in those\r\npicturesque ruins. Thomas Coryate the Odcombian--that strange amalgam\r\nof shrewdness, buffoonery, learning, and adventure--became a member\r\nof the Hall in 1596. He passed his life in wandering afoot--a pauper\r\npilgrim--through the East. He was so apt a linguist as to silence\r\n“a laundry woman, a famous scold,” in her own Hindustani. From the\r\nCourt of the Great Mogul he dated epistles, which were the amusement\r\nof the wits, and are now the treasures of the collector of literary\r\ncuriosities. These, and the “Crudities hastily gobbled up,” a record of\r\nhis earlier wanderings in Europe, will preserve his memory, when men of\r\nmore serious consequence have passed into oblivion.\r\n\r\nAt this low ebb of the Hall’s chequered existence, it seems to have\r\nbeen a common practice to let lodgings to persons not necessarily\r\nconnected with the Hall. We have already seen how Sir George Peckham\r\noccupied a lodging in Principal Stocke’s time; the famous Thomas Allen\r\nagain in the reign of Elizabeth and James found a refuge here for many\r\nyears; and now Degory Whear, who had been, with Camden, a member of\r\nBroadgates Hall, and then Fellow of Exeter, retiring with his wife to\r\nOxford upon his patron’s death, had rooms allotted to him in Gloucester\r\nHall. In 1622 he was, through Allen’s interest, appointed by Camden the\r\nfirst Professor on his History Foundation, and retained this chair,\r\ntogether with the Principalship of the Hall to which he was nominated\r\nin 1626, until his death in 1647. Degory Whear, though the friend and\r\n_protégé_ of so good antiquaries as Allen and Camden, finds amusingly\r\nscant favour in the eyes of Antony Wood, who bestows upon him the faint\r\npraise that “he was esteemed by some a learned and genteel man, and by\r\nothers a Calvinist. He left behind him a widow and children, who soon\r\nafter became poor, and whether the Females lived honestly, ’tis not for\r\nme to dispute it.”\r\n\r\nThe fame or vigour of Degory Whear, with the reputation of Thomas\r\nAllen, revived the decaying fortunes of the Hall; for we are told\r\nthat “in his time there were 100 students: and some being persons of\r\nquality, ten or twelve met in their doublets of cloth of gold and\r\nsilver.” Among other noticeable names Christopher Merritt, Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society, was admitted in 1632, and Richard Lovelace\r\nin 1634. At that date there were ninety-two students in the Hall\r\n(Wood’s _Life_, ii. 246). Degory Whear not only filled his Hall with\r\nstudents, but carried out many much-needed repairs of the buildings.\r\nThe chapel, for instance, to the erection of which we have seen that\r\nSt. John’s contributed six timber trees from Bagley Wood, was now by\r\nhis exertions completed; the Hall and other buildings were repaired;\r\nbooks were purchased for the Library, plate for the Buttery. In a MS.\r\nbook preserved in the College Library are set forth the names of donors\r\nto these objects between the years 1630 and 1640. Among the entries\r\nare the following--“_Kenelmus Digby_ Eques auratus 2 li. _Johannes\r\nPym_ armiger 20s. _Rogerus Griffin_ civis Oxon. e Collegio pistorum\r\ndonavit 2 millia scandularum ad valorem 22 solid. _Johannes Rousæus_\r\npublicæ Bibliothecæ præfectus 1 li. 2s. _Samuel Fell_ S. Th. Doctor 5\r\nli. _Thomas Clayton_ Regius in Medicina Professor 2 li. _Guil. Burton_\r\nLL. Baccalaureatus gradum suscepturus 2 li. 10s.” This last was at\r\nfirst a student at Queen’s, where he was the contemporary and friend of\r\nGerard Langbaine, but, his means failing him, Mr. Allen brought him to\r\nGloucester Hall, and conferred on him the Greek Lecture there. As the\r\nfriend of Langbaine it may be supposed he would have a friendly leaning\r\nto the plays which at this time, Wood says, were acted by stealth “in\r\nKettle Hall, or at Holywell Mill, or in the Refectory at Gloucester\r\nHall” (_Life_, ii. 148). He subsequently became the Usher to the famous\r\nThomas Farnaby, and at last Master of the School of Kingston-on-Thames.\r\nHis “Graecæ Linguæ Historia; sive oratio habita olim Oxoniis in Aula\r\nGlevocestrensi ante XX & VI annos,” was published in 1657 with a\r\nlaudatory letter of Langbaine’s, and a dedication to his pupil Thomas\r\nThynne.\r\n\r\nWe next have an account of the expenditure upon the chapel--“Imprimis\r\nfabro murario sive cæmentario 25 li 10s. Materiario sive fabro tignario\r\n38 li 10s. Gypsatori et scandulario 10 li. 11s. Vitriario 4 li 6s.\r\nfabro ferrario 7 li 10s. pictori 1 li 4s. storealatori 00 9s.”\r\n\r\nThe Hall too was put into repair; for this Thomas Allen’s legacy of £10\r\nwas employed, as also for the purchase of an _armarium_ or bookcase,\r\n“parieti inferioris sacelli affixum.” But in spite of this safeguard,\r\nthe books, Wood says, with pathetic simplicity, “though kept in a large\r\npress, have been thieved away for the most part, and are now dwindled\r\nto an inconsiderable nothing.” Under the date 1637 there is an entry\r\nof a contribution of 40 shillings to the expenses of the University\r\nin the reception of the King and Queen. It may be noted that these\r\ndisbursements seem to have required the assent of the Masters of the\r\nHall as well as of the Principal.\r\n\r\nThere are two papers in the University Archives bearing the signature\r\nof Degory Whear as Principal, which give some information as to fees\r\nand customary observances of the Hall. Commoners upon admission paid to\r\nthe House 4_s._, to the College officers (Manciple, Butler and Cook)\r\n4_s._ Semi-commoners or Battlers, to the House 2_s._, to the officers\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ A “Poor Scholar” paid nothing. Every Commoner paid weekly\r\nto the Butler 1_d._, towards the Servitors of the Hall a halfpenny. He\r\nalso paid quarterly 1_s._ for wages to the Manciple and Cook, besides\r\na varying sum for Decrements, a term which covered kitchen fuel,\r\ntable-cloths, utensils, &c. This item sometimes amounted to 5_s._\r\na quarter, never more. On taking any Degree 10_s._ was paid to the\r\nPrincipal, and another 10_s._ to the House, or else there was given a\r\npresentation Dinner. The Principal further received only the chamber\r\nrents, out of which he kept the chambers in repair, and paid quarterly\r\nto two Moderators or Readers the sum of £1 6_s._ 8_d._ It appears that\r\nit was the custom for every Commoner to take his turn as Steward, go\r\nto market with the Manciple and Cook, see the provisions bought for\r\nready money, apportion the amount for each meal, attend to oversee\r\nthe divisions at Dinner and Supper, and be accountable for any Commons\r\nsent to private chambers. At the end of every quarter the accounts\r\nwere inspected by the Principal and such of the Masters as he pleased\r\nto send for. On Act Monday it had been customary for the proceeding\r\nMasters to keep a common supper in the Hall, but this charge had of\r\nlate years been turned to the building of an Oratory, the flooring of\r\nthe Hall, the purchase of plate and of books.\r\n\r\nIn Whear’s time then the Hall must be regarded as having attained its\r\nhighest prosperity, due no doubt partly to the energy and distinction\r\nof the Principal, but due also in great measure to the influence and\r\nreputation of Mr. Thomas Allen, to whom the Principal himself had\r\nowed his promotion. This distinguished mathematician and antiquary,\r\n“being much inclined to a retired life, and averse from taking Holy\r\nOrders,”[335] about 1570 resigned his Fellowship at Trinity College,\r\nand took up his residence in Gloucester Hall, where he remained until\r\nhis death in 1632. His intimate relations with the Chancellor, the\r\nEarl of Leicester, at once marked and increased his distinction,\r\nwhile it exposed him to the attacks of Leicester’s enemies. Leicester\r\nwould have nominated him to a Bishoprick, and the malignant author\r\nof “Leycester’s Commonwealth” stigmatizes him as one of Leicester’s\r\nspies and intelligencers in the University, and couples him with his\r\nfriend John Dee as an atheist and Leicester’s agent “for figuring and\r\nconjuring.” Indeed his reputation as a mathematician (“he was,” says\r\nhis pupil Burton, “the very soul and sun of all the Mathematicians\r\nof his time”) caused him to be regarded by the vulgar as a magician.\r\nFuller says of him that “he succeeded to the skill and scandal of Friar\r\nBacon,” and that his servitor would tell the gaping enquirer that “he\r\nmet the spirits coming up the stairs like bees.” Indeed in those days\r\nwhen horoscopes were in fashion the mathematician merged into the\r\nastrologer; the friend of John Dee not unnaturally was supposed to\r\nhave dealings in magical arts, and Leicester’s patronage of both would\r\ngive countenance to the reputation. But the friendship of the most\r\nlearned men of the time--of Bodley, Saville, Camden, Cotton, Spelman,\r\nSelden--is an indication of Allen’s genuine attainments. Bodley by his\r\nwill bequeaths to Mr. Wm. Gent of Gloucester Hall “my best gown and my\r\nbest cloak, and the next gown and cloak to my best I do bequeath to\r\nMr. Thomas Allen of the same Hall.” Camden also leaves him in his will\r\nthe sum of £16.[336] Allen’s valuable collection of MSS. passed into\r\nthe hands of his eccentric pupil, Sir Kenelm Digby, by whom they were\r\nplaced in Sir Thomas Bodley’s newly-founded library.\r\n\r\nOn Whear’s decease in 1647 Tobias Garbrand, of Dutch descent, was made\r\nPrincipal by the Earl of Pembroke as Chancellor. He was ejected at the\r\nRestoration in 1660. From this date the fortunes of the Hall seemed to\r\nhave reached their lowest depth.[337] If a stray gleam of fortune lit\r\nupon the place, it was only to suffer immediate eclipse. Thus, when\r\nJohn Warner, Bishop of Rochester, left a foundation in 1666 for the\r\nmaintenance of four Scotch scholars to be trained as ministers, and the\r\nMasters and Fellows of Balliol College were unwilling to receive them,\r\nas being not in any way advantageous to the House, they were for a time\r\nplaced in Gloucester Hall. But when Dr. Good became Master of Balliol\r\nin 1672, Gutch remarks with quiet humour, “he took order that they\r\nshould be translated thither, and there they yet continue.”\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the Hall sank lower and lower, till a time came when\r\nit remained for several years entirely untenanted by students. It\r\nshared in the general depression of the University, to which Wood bears\r\nevidence. “Not one Scholar matric. in 1675, 1676, 1677, 1678, not one\r\nScholar in Gloucester Hall, only the Principal and his family, and two\r\nor three more families that live there in some part to keep it from\r\nruin, the paths are grown over with grass, the way into the Hall and\r\nChapel made up with boards.”\r\n\r\nPrideaux, writing to Ellis (Sept. 18, 1676), says--“Gloucester Hall\r\nis like to be demolished, the charge of Chimney money being so great\r\nthat Byrom Eaton will scarce live there any longer. There hath been no\r\nscholars there these three or four years: for all which time the hall\r\nbeing in arrears for this tax the collectors have at last fallen upon\r\nthe principal, who being by the Act liable to the payment, hath made\r\ngreat complaints about the town and created us very good sport; but the\r\nold fool hath been forced to pay the money, which hath amounted to a\r\nconsiderable sum.”\r\n\r\nLoggan’s picturesque view, taken in 1675, suggests a mournful\r\ndesolation, and the pathetic motto which it bears--“Quare fecit Dominus\r\nsic domui huic?”--is eloquent of decay. Dr. Byrom Eaton, Archdeacon\r\nof Stow, and then of Leicester, had held the Principality for thirty\r\nyears, when in 1692 he resigned it to make way for a younger and more\r\nvigorous man. Such was found in Dr. Woodroffe, one of the Canons\r\nof Christ Church, whose nomination to the Deanery by James II. in\r\n1688 had been cancelled at the Revolution in favour of Dean Aldrich.\r\nWoodroffe is described by Wood as “a man of a generous and public\r\nspirit, who bestowed several hundred pounds in repairing (the place)\r\nand making it a fit habitation for the Muses, which being done he by\r\nhis great interest among the gentry made it flourish with hopeful\r\nsprouts.” The hopeful sprouts, however, do not seem to have been so\r\nvery numerous after all, since we find the entry in Wood’s _Life_ under\r\ndate Jan. 1694--“I was with Dr. Woodroffe, and he told me he had six\r\nin Commons at Gloucester Hall, his 2 sons two.” Prideaux’s letters\r\nto Ellis contain several references to Dr. Woodroffe, the reverse of\r\ncomplimentary--ludicrous accounts of sermons, which he confesses to\r\nbe hearsay accounts, accusations of heiress hunting, of whimsical\r\nill-temper, of want of dignity. “Last night he had Madam Walcup at his\r\nlodgings, and stood with her in a great window next the quadrangle,\r\nwhere he was seen by Mr. Dean himself and almost all the house toying\r\nwith her most ridiculously and fanning himself with her fan for almost\r\nall the afternoon.” But Prideaux’s gossip was probably inspired by\r\npersonal antipathies and College jealousies. Woodroffe was no doubt a\r\nkeen, bustling, pushing man.[338] He was shrewd enough, at any rate,\r\nto marry a good fortune; but became involved in difficulties, which\r\nled to the sequestration of his canonry. He seems to have lost no\r\nopportunity of advertising himself and combining “public spirit” with\r\nprivate advantage. Such was the man who became associated with one of\r\nthe most interesting though short-lived experiments in the history of\r\nthe University--the establishment of a Greek College. Some seventy\r\nyears had passed since Cyril Lucar, Patriarch first of Alexandria and\r\nthen of Constantinople, had sent to England a Greek youth, Metrophanes\r\nCritopylos, whom Abp. Abbott placed at Balliol College, of which his\r\nbrother had not long before been Master. Here Critopylos remained as a\r\nstudent till about 1622, when he returned to the East, and subsequently\r\nbecame Patriarch of Alexandria in the room of Cyril Lucar. Nothing\r\nmore seems to have come of this particular overture, but the English\r\nChaplains of Constantinople, Smyrna, and Aleppo, kept open to some\r\nextent the communications with the Eastern Church. At last, upon the\r\nrepresentations of Joseph Georgirenes, Metropolitan of Samos (a man\r\nwho subsequently took refuge in London, and had built for him as a\r\nGreek church what is now St. Mary’s, Crown St. Soho), Archbishop\r\nSancroft and others who favoured the hope of reunion with the Eastern\r\nChurch promoted a scheme for the education of a body of Greek youths\r\nat Oxford, and the establishment of a Greek College there. Foremost\r\namongst Oxford sympathizers was Dr. Woodroffe, the newly appointed\r\nPrincipal of Gloucester Hall. In a letter to Callinicos, the Patriarch\r\nof Constantinople, he suggests that twenty students, five from each of\r\nthe four patriarchates, should be sent over to the Greek College now\r\nfounded at Oxford (Gloucester Hall), which had been placed “on the same\r\nrank footing and privilege which the other Colleges enjoy there.” He\r\nexplains the course of study to be pursued, and suggests the advantage\r\nof a reciprocity of students, as also of books and manuscripts. He\r\ndesignates the three English chaplains named above as convenient\r\nchannels of communication. The scheme contemplated an annual succession\r\nof students, who were to be of two classes. For two years they were to\r\nconverse in Ancient Greek, and then to learn Latin and Hebrew. They\r\nwere to study Aristotle, Plato, the Greek Fathers, and Controversial\r\nDivinity. The services were to be in Greek, and public exercises were\r\nto be performed in Greek, as directed by the Vice-Chancellor. Their\r\nhabit was to be “the gravest worn in their country,” and finally they\r\nwere to be returned to their respective Patriarchs with a report of\r\nthe progress made. Trustees were to manage the funds of the College,\r\nwhich was to be supported by voluntary contributions. This bold scheme\r\nwas but partially attempted, and before long came to a disastrous end.\r\nMr. Ffoulkes, who first claimed attention in the “Union Review” for\r\nthe Greek College, which, as he observes, had been strangely ignored\r\nby Wood’s continuators, quotes from Mr. E. Stevens, a nonjuror, and\r\nenthusiastic advocate of “Reunion,” his account of the experiment and\r\nits breakdown. Five young Grecians were in 1698 brought from Smyrna\r\nand placed in Gloucester Hall. Three of them were, according to Mr.\r\nStephens, lured away by Roman emissaries: two of these, brothers, after\r\nvarious adventures, took refuge with Mr. Stephens, and were at last\r\nsent home “with their faith unscathed.” The third was decoyed to Paris,\r\nto the Greek College lately established there, presumably in rivalry of\r\nthe Oxford scheme. There appears too to have been another establishment\r\nset up in friendly rivalry at Halle in Saxony. But the most fatal blow\r\nwas the mismanagement of the College itself. “Though they who came\r\nfirst were well enough ordered for some time; yet afterwards they and\r\nthose who came after them were so ill-accommodated both for their\r\nstudies and other necessaries, that some of them staid not many months,\r\nand others would have been gone if they had known how; and there are\r\nnow but two left there.”[339] Add to these drawbacks the temptations\r\nof London, and it is not surprising that the Oxford College received\r\nits quietus in a missive from Constantinople. “The irregular life of\r\ncertain priests and laymen of the Eastern Church, living in London, is\r\na matter of great concern to the Church. Wherefore the Church forbids\r\nany to go and study at Oxford, be they ever so willing.” This was in\r\n1705. From that moment, as Mr. Ffoulkes picturesquely says, the Greek\r\nCollege “disappears like a dream.” Of its students one name only is\r\npreserved to us. We find in _Hearne_ (March 15th, 1707)--“Francis\r\nPrasalendius, a Græcian of the Isle of Corcyra, lately a student in the\r\nPublic Library, and of Gloucester Hall, has printed a book in the Greek\r\nlanguage (writ very well as I am informed by one of the Græcians of\r\nGlouc. Hall) against Traditions, in which he falls upon Dr. Woodroffe\r\nvery smartly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worcester College, founded 1714._\r\n\r\nBut while the Greek College was still perishing of inanition, its\r\nprincipal was engaged in a scheme of a more ambitious though less\r\ninteresting nature. A Worcestershire Baronet, Sir Thomas Cookes, had\r\nmade known his desire through the Bishop of Worcester of founding a\r\nCollege at Oxford; £10,000 was the sum he proposed for an endowment.\r\nThere was competition for the prize. Dr. Woodroffe wanted to secure it\r\nfor Gloucester Hall, Dr. Mill for St. Edmund Hall, Dr. Lancaster for\r\nMagdalen Hall; Balliol College was at one time the favourite object, at\r\nanother a workhouse for his county. The choice inclined to Gloucester\r\nHall, but was well-nigh lost; for Woodroffe had inserted in the charter\r\na clause providing that the King should have liberty to put in and\r\nturn out the Fellows at his pleasure. With the recent experience of\r\nMagdalen fresh in men’s minds, such intervention of the crown was not\r\nlikely to find favour, and Bishop Stillingfleet drily observed that\r\n“kings have already had enough to do with our Colleges.” The hopes of\r\nEdmund Hall rose high; for indeed the Bishop had, according to Hearne,\r\nnominated that Hall in the first place. However Dr. Woodroffe prudently\r\nwithdrew his clause, and in 1698 a charter passed the great seal for\r\nthe incorporation of the Hall under the title of the Provost, Fellows,\r\nand Scholars of Worcester College, with Dr. Woodroffe for the first\r\nProvost.[340] This was followed by a Ratification dated November 18th,\r\nnaming the Bishop of Worcester as Visitor, and the Bishop of Oxford as\r\nhis assessor in difficult cases, and making elaborate provision for the\r\norganization, conduct, and educational system of the College. There\r\nwere to be twelve Fellows, six Senior Tutors, six Junior Sub-Tutors,\r\nand eight Scholars, chosen from the Founder’s schools of Bromsgrove and\r\nFeckenham, or, failing them, from Worcester and Hartlebury. Each Fellow\r\nand Scholar was to have £14 per annum, the Provost double that amount.\r\nThere were to be Lectureships, two “solemnes” in Theology and History,\r\nthree ordinary in Mathematics, Philosophy, and Philology; the Lecture\r\nin Theology to be catechetical, on the model of that at Balliol, and\r\nto be given in the chapel. The Prælector of History was to lecture\r\nfrom seven to nine on Sundays on Biblical history. The others were to\r\nlecture at the discretion of the Provost five or at least four times a\r\nweek. An elaborate scheme of medical and other studies was prescribed.\r\nThere was a carefully-graduated scale of payments “obeuntibus cursus\r\net acta,” ending with 13_s._ 4_d._ for the speech in commemoration of\r\nthe Founder. The Provost was to allot a cubiculum to one or at the\r\nmost to two occupants. In winter the afternoon chapel service was to\r\nbe at three, the morning service at seven, but in summer at six. This\r\nwas to consist of a shorter Latin form “ad usum Ecclesiæ Xti,” with a\r\nchapter of the Bible in Greek. Private prayers and Bible-reading were\r\nenjoined for each day, and two hours specified for Sunday. A chapter in\r\nGreek or Latin was to be read at meal-times in Hall. Offenders against\r\nrules were to be “gated” or sent into seclusion, “quasi minor quædam\r\nexcommunicatio,” or else to be exiled to the ante-chapel. As regards\r\nthe cook, butler, &c. the Aularian Statutes were to be observed.\r\n\r\nAfter all the Charter remained a dead letter. Sir Thomas Cookes,\r\nanxious to find excuses for putting off Dr. Woodroffe’s importunities,\r\nclaimed for his heirs the nomination to the Headship; and after two\r\nyears the Chancellor conceded this point. It was objected that the\r\nChancellor had not the power to make this concession without the\r\nconsent of Convocation: which was never asked; and if it had, would\r\nnot have been given. Sir Thomas found fresh reasons for hanging back.\r\nThe fact that Gloucester Hall was a leasehold and that St. John’s were\r\nsupposed to have been forbidden by their Founder to part with the fee\r\nsimple was one of these difficulties. Then there were the Statutes,\r\nwhich Sir Thomas Cookes persistently refused to sign, “nor would he pay\r\none farthing for passing the Charter.” In 1701 he died, leaving his\r\n£10,000 in the hands of certain Bishops, with the Vice-Chancellor and\r\nthe Heads of Houses, for the carrying out his intentions. The money was\r\nleft to accumulate for some years till it amounted to £15,000. In the\r\nmeantime Dr. Woodroffe tries to obtain an Act in 1702 for settling the\r\nmoney on Gloucester Hall, the lease of which he proposed St. John’s\r\nCollege should make perpetual at the then rent of £5 10_s._ The Bill,\r\nhowever, was thrown out on the second reading. At Oxford, it is clear,\r\nthere was a powerful opposition to Dr. Woodroffe and his claim for\r\nGloucester Hall. On Nov. 22, 1707, nineteen out of the thirty Trustees\r\nmet in the Convocation House, and on the ground that “the erecting of\r\nBuildings would make the charity of less use than endowing some Hall\r\nin Oxford already built,” determined “to fix the Charity at Magdalen\r\nHall, and to endow Fellows and Scholars there.” On the other hand the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Worcester, the Bishop of Oxford\r\nand others were in favour of carrying out what they believed to be in\r\nspite of all his vacillation the final determination of Sir Thomas\r\nCookes in favour of Gloucester Hall. They deposed moreover[341] that\r\n“the ground Plats of Gloucester Hall and the Gloucester Hall buildings\r\nQuadrangles and Gardens are 3 times as much as Magdalen Hall, and the\r\nground on which the buildings of Gloucester Hall stand is twice as much\r\nas that of Magdalen Hall, and there are large and capacious chambers\r\nin Gloucester Hall to receive 20 scholars, and 9 are inhabited, and\r\nthe principal’s lodgings are in good repair and fit for a family of\r\n12 persons, and there is a large Hall, Chapel, Buttery and Kitchen,\r\nand a large common room lately wainscoted and sash windows, and in\r\nlaying out about £500 in repairs there will be good conveniency for 60\r\nscholars, and the place is pleasantly situated and in a good air.” Dr.\r\nWoodroffe dies in 1711, his ambition still unfulfilled, and a Fellow of\r\nSt. John’s, Dr. Richard Blechynden, succeeds to the Principalship of\r\nan empty Hall. There was, according to Hearne, hardly one Scholar in\r\nthe place. At last the trustees saw their way to carrying out the will\r\nof Sir Thomas Cookes. St. John’s College in 1713 agrees to alienate\r\nGloucester Hall for the sum of £200, and a quit-rent of 20_s._ per\r\nannum. In the following year, two days only before the Queen’s death, a\r\nCharter of Incorporation, for the second time, passes the great seal,\r\nand Gloucester Hall or College is finally merged in Worcester College.\r\nThe foundation was now to consist of a Provost, six Fellows, and six\r\nScholars, whose emoluments were to be on a somewhat more liberal\r\nscale than that of the original statutes. Fellows and Scholars were\r\nto be allowed sixpence a day for commons, the Fellows to have £30 per\r\nannum, the Scholars 13_s._ 8_d._ a quarter, the Provost £80 per annum,\r\nbut no allowance for commons. Among the other “ministri” was to be a\r\nTonsor, receiving an annual salary of 20_s._ This important official\r\nlingered on in diminished importance till the present generation. The\r\nBishops of Worcester and Oxford and the Vice-Chancellor were appointed\r\nVisitors. In other respects the provisions of the new Statutes were\r\nmuch simplified. The scheme of Lectureships was omitted; so were the\r\nelaborate directions as to studies, private devotions, &c., as well\r\nas the scale of payments on the performance of exercises. Latin was\r\nto be the ordinary speech, “so far as might be convenient,” except at\r\nCollege meetings. Undergraduates were to “dispute” every day, and write\r\nweekly Themes; Bachelors to “dispute” twice a week, and make a Terminal\r\n“Declamation.” Candidates for Degrees were to oppose or respond on a\r\nproblem set by the Provost in the College Hall, while candidates for\r\nthe M.A. Degree had the option of commenting on a passage of Aristotle.\r\nOn the Degree Day a Bachelor was to give a supper, or pay 20_s._ for\r\nthe College uses. The supper given by an M.A. was not to exceed 40_s._\r\n\r\nOf the new College Principal Blechynden was named as the first Provost;\r\nof the six Fellows, one, Roger Bouchier, was already a member of\r\nthe Hall--“a man of great reading in various sorts of learning, the\r\ngreatest man in England for Divinity.”[342] The others were Thomas\r\nClymer of All Souls’, Robert Burd of St. John’s, William Bradley of New\r\nInn Hall, Joseph Penn of Wadham, and Samuel Creswick of Pembroke, who\r\nwas afterwards Dean of Wells.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1720, that with the modest sum of £798 0_s._ 3_d._,\r\nthe remnant of a disputed bequest of Mrs. Margaret Alcorne, the\r\nnewly-founded College was enabled to commence the “restoration” of\r\nits buildings. Had the designs of Dr. Clarke, illustrated by the\r\nOxford Almanack of 1741, which were similar in character to those of\r\nHawkesmoor and other architects for the reconstruction of Brasenose,\r\nAll Souls’, and Magdalen, been carried out, the picturesque history\r\nof the place would have been entirely effaced, and a quadrangle of\r\n“correct” and “elegant” monotony would have satisfied the taste of\r\nDean Aldrich and the amateurs of the day. Fortunately the means were\r\nwanting; all that was put in hand at first were the Chapel, Hall,\r\nand Library. By the liberality of Dr. Clarke the interior of the\r\nLibrary was completed in 1736, its exterior in 1746. The Hall was at\r\nlast finished in 1784, while the Chapel still remained incompleted\r\nin 1786, the date of Gutch’s account--nor does the College Register\r\ngive any indication on the point. But in the meantime two considerable\r\nbenefactors arose, who contributed new Foundations to the corporation.\r\nDr. Clarke, Fellow of All Souls’ and Member for the University, left\r\nan endowment for six Fellowships and three Scholarships, together with\r\nhis valuable library, while Mrs. Sarah Eaton, daughter of the former\r\nprincipal, bequeathed an endowment for seven Fellowships and five\r\nScholarships to be held by the sons of clergymen. These new Foundations\r\nwere incorporated by Charter in 1744. For lodging Dr. Clarke’s\r\nFoundation the demolition of the old buildings on the north side of the\r\nquadrangle was begun, and nine sets of rooms erected by his trustees,\r\n1753-9, while in 1773 the remainder of the old north side was swept\r\naway, and twelve sets of rooms built for Mrs. Eaton’s Foundation,\r\ntogether with the present Provost’s lodgings. Meanwhile the College was\r\nprovidently with such resources as it possessed enlarging its borders.\r\nIn 1741 it purchased of St. John’s College for £850 the garden ground\r\non the south side of the College, and in 1744 the gardens and meadows\r\nto the north and west, “together with the house called the Cock and\r\nBottle.” In 1801 it bought for £1330 the “King’s Head,” opposite to\r\nthe front of the College, and in 1813 enfranchised the premises on the\r\neast front held under lease of the City; while in 1806 it cleared away\r\n“Woodroffe’s Folly,” a building erected by that Principal opposite\r\nthe front of the College, for which St. John’s received a valuation\r\nof £401 16_s._ The College thus became surrounded with an open belt,\r\ndestined to be an incalculable boon in the modern days of building\r\nextension. The garden ground on the south side was in 1813 ordered to\r\nbe kept in hand for the use of the Fellows, and it was about the year\r\n1827 that the late Mr. Greswell signalized his Bursarship by laying\r\nout the ornamental grounds, as they now exist. These gardens, falling\r\nto a piece of water, together with the fortunate preservation of an\r\nopen quadrangle, a mode of construction for the merits of which Sir\r\nChristopher Wren contended at Trinity,[343] secured to the College\r\nthe sanitary as well as the picturesque advantages of a _rus in\r\nurbe_--a “_rus_” so rural that, the tradition runs, a tutor of the last\r\ngeneration would take his gun, and slip down between his lectures to\r\nthe pool for a shot at a stray snipe.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gower, upon Dr. Blechynden’s death, was nominated Provost\r\nin 1736. He had been admitted Scholar in 1715, the year after the\r\nincorporation of the College. He rivalled Thomas Allen in the length\r\nof his connection with the College. For 62 years he was borne upon\r\nits foundations, as Scholar, Fellow, or Provost. Longevity has been\r\na characteristic of the Provosts of this College. One only, Dr.\r\nSheffield, held his office for so short a period as 18 years. The\r\nother three, Gower, Landon, and Cotton, were Provosts respectively for\r\n41, 44, and 41 years--collectively 126 years, and Dr. Cotton kept 70\r\nyears of unbroken residence. Dr. Gower was a man of great literary\r\nattainments. He left many valuable books to the College Library. Dr.\r\nKing[344] says that he was “acquainted with three persons only who\r\nspoke English with that eloquence and propriety that if all they said\r\nhad been immediately committed to writing, any judge of the English\r\nlanguage would have pronounced it an excellent and very beautiful\r\nstyle.” The other two were Atterbury and Johnson. It was in his second\r\nyear’s Provostship that Samuel Foote of Worcester School claimed and\r\nestablished a right to a Scholarship as Founder’s kin. His student\r\nlife was brief and stormy. In 1740 the College passes sentence that\r\n“Samuel Foote having by a long-continued course of ill-behaviour\r\nrendered himself obnoxious to frequent censure of the Society public\r\nand private, and having while he was under censure for lying out of\r\nCollege insolently and presumptuously withdrawn himself and refused to\r\nanswer to several heinous crimes objected to him, though duly cited\r\nby the Provost by an instrument in form, in not appearing to the said\r\ncitation, for the above reasons his Scholarship is declared void,\r\nand he is hereby deprived of all benefit and advantage of the said\r\nScholarship.” This entry gives an interest to the opening of Gower’s\r\nProvostship; another of a different character occurs near its close. In\r\n1775 is recorded an injunction of the Visitors of the College “as to\r\nthe use of napkins in the Common Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe Provostship of Dr. Landon, 1795-1835, witnessed the commencement\r\nof that growth of Oxford, of which our own generation has seen so\r\nremarkable a development. The opening up of Beaumont St., as to which\r\nthe College was in treaty with the city in 1820, materially assisted in\r\ndrawing Worcester within the comity of Colleges.[345] It was still--and\r\nfor many years to come--unrecognized upon the Proctorial rota. The\r\nfirst Proctor it nominated in its own right held office in 1863. The\r\nCollege could only be approached either by George St. and Stockwell\r\nSt., or more directly by the narrow alley called Friar’s Entry; and an\r\namusing picture is given of the stately Vice-Chancellor--“Old Glory”\r\nwas his soubriquet--preceded by his Bedels, with their gold and silver\r\nmaces, ducking beneath the fluttering household linen suspended across\r\nthe alley on washing day. This must have been a trying test of the\r\ndignified deportment which had distinguished Dr. Landon as host of the\r\nAllied Sovereigns, and gained for him--so it is said--from the Prince\r\nRegent the Deanery of Exeter.\r\n\r\nThe College, thus drawn more directly within the influences of\r\nUniversity life, began to feel the impulse given to academical resort\r\nby times of peace. New rooms were added; sets long vacant were fitted\r\nup for occupants. In 1821 three additional sets were constructed “in\r\nthe space afforded by the old College chapel.” In 1822 it was ordered\r\nthat all such apartments not at present inhabited, as shall be found\r\ncapable of accommodating undergraduates, be immediately prepared\r\nfor their reception. In 1824 the roof of part of the old building\r\nwas raised, so as to give six additional sets of rooms. Finally in\r\n1844 a new and handsome kitchen was built and seven additional sets\r\nconstructed.[346]\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished inmate of the College in Landon’s time was\r\nThomas de Quincey, of whom his old servant on No. 10 staircase--Common\r\nRoom man till 1865--retained many memories. He lived a somewhat recluse\r\nlife. He was always buying fresh books, and was sometimes at a loss\r\nhow to find money for them. In those days men dressed for Hall: and De\r\nQuincey having one day parted with his one waistcoat for the purchase\r\nof a book went into Hall hiding his loss of clothing as best he could.\r\nBut concealment was in vain, and he was promptly sconced for the\r\ndeficiency. De Quincey crowned the peculiarities of his College career\r\nby suddenly leaving Oxford before the close of a brilliant examination.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 another member of the College--Francis William Newman--received\r\nthe unique distinction of a present of books (now in the College\r\nLibrary) from his mathematical examiners. Bonamy Price, Arnold’s\r\nfavourite pupil, shed a lustre upon the next generation of\r\nundergraduates. Both of them were subsequently Honorary Fellows of\r\nthe College, and were present at the celebration of its six hundredth\r\nanniversary. Dr. Bloxam, a contemporary of the two, preserves some\r\ninteresting recollections of the customs of the day. The Bachelors who\r\nresided for their M.A. Degree used to appear in Hall in full evening\r\ndress, breeches and silk stockings. Undergraduates had left off\r\nattending dinner in white neckcloths and evening costume. The table on\r\nthe right was occupied by the gay men of the College, and was called\r\nthe “Sinners’ Table.” These formed a class by themselves. The table on\r\nthe left was called the “Smilers’ Table,” who also formed a distinct\r\nset between the “Sinners” and the “Saints,” the latter being the more\r\nquiet men, who occupied the table nearest the High Table, on the left.\r\nThe Fellow Commoners, an institution retained at the present day for\r\nthe convenience of older men resorting to the University, were at that\r\ntime young men of fortune, who desired an exemption from the stricter\r\ndiscipline of undergraduate life. They dined at the High Table, and\r\nwere members of the Common Room. But their affinities lay rather with\r\nthe occupants of the “Sinners’ Table,” and their existence must have\r\nbeen a perpetual difficulty to a sorely-tried Dean. “Bodley” Coxe, a\r\nmember of the College in those days, subsequently one of its Honorary\r\nFellows, would tell of the formidable muster of “pinks” in Beaumont\r\nSt. after a champagne breakfast, and of the excuse which satisfied a\r\nsimple-minded tutor that the delinquent would not offend again during\r\nthe whole of the summer.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great change too in the habits of the Seniors. The\r\ntutors, as elsewhere, gave their lectures or rather lessons, consisting\r\nof translations by the class, with questions and answers, without form\r\nor ceremony in their own rooms. After an early dinner they would retire\r\nto an uncarpeted Common Room. There after wine long clay pipes were a\r\nregular indulgence. An evening walk or other interlude was succeeded\r\nby a hot supper at nine, and the evening finished with a rubber. Dr.\r\nCotton in his time was singular in retiring to his rooms after Common\r\nRoom without joining the whist and supper party. All these customs have\r\ndropped away with the barbers and knee-breeches of our fathers. The\r\nLatin form of Morning Prayers was abolished by an excess of reforming\r\nzeal, and the Statutes of the College are no longer recited in annual\r\nconclave. Ordinances have succeeded statutes, and statutes succeeded\r\nordinances. One ancient custom lingers on--the Porter still makes his\r\nmorning rounds, and hammers upon the door of each staircase with a\r\nwooden mallet. This is a Benedictine usage, an echo of the thirteenth\r\ncentury continuing to haunt the old Benedictine walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nHERTFORD COLLEGE.[347]\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. H. RASHDALL, M.A., FELLOW OF HERTFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Hertford is the youngest College of the University, it\r\nstands close to the very centre of the University’s most ancient\r\nhome, on a site which has been the scene of Academical life from the\r\nearliest times. What the Oxford Local Board has chosen to call S.\r\nCatherine’s Street, has been known from the earliest times onwards as\r\n“Catte-Street” (Vicus Murilegorum). Lying just outside School Street,\r\nthe scene of the Arts lectures, Cat Street was in the twelfth century\r\nthe especial home of the Writers, Bookbinders, Parchment-makers, and\r\nIlluminers, for whose wares the growth of the University had created a\r\ndemand. In the following century, it was partly occupied by University\r\nHalls or Hospices. At least four were comprised within the limits of\r\nthe present College: Cat Hall, near the present Principal’s Lodgings;\r\nBlack Hall, at the corner of New College Lane; Hart Hall, and Arthur\r\nHall, the two latter occupying the Library corner of the Quadrangle.\r\nHart Hall eventually swallowed up all its neighbours as well as the\r\nground between them. The history of this process want of space forbids\r\nme to trace. I must confine myself to the Hall which has given its name\r\nto the present College.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hart Hall_, 1280(?)-1740.\r\n\r\nThe house is first known to have been a residence for scholars when\r\nit had passed into the possession of one Elias de Hertford, from whom\r\nit got its name of Hert Hall (_Aula Cervina_). This was between 1261\r\nand 1284. A Hall was then simply a boarding-house, hired by a party of\r\nstudents as a residence. One of them, called a Principal, paid the rent\r\nand collected the amount from the rest. From the first the Principal\r\npossessed a certain authority, but it was not necessary that he should\r\nbe a Master or even a Graduate. Eventually the University required\r\nthat he should be a Graduate, and a new Principal had to be admitted\r\nby the Chancellor. When, after the Reformation, the Colleges absorbed\r\nthe greater part of the now greatly reduced Academic population, most\r\nof the old Halls disappeared and no new ones were created. Hence the\r\nfew that remained divided the monopoly of University education with\r\nthe Colleges, and their Principalships became not unimportant pieces\r\nof patronage, which after a long struggle the Chancellor succeeded in\r\nappropriating to himself, except in the case of S. Edmund Hall. To a\r\nvery late period, however, there remained traces of the old democratic\r\n_régime_, under which the students claimed the right to elect their\r\nown Principal, that is to say, to consent to the transfer of the\r\nhouse by the landlord from one Principal to another. Since, prior to\r\nthe Laudian statutes, there was nothing to prevent a scholar freely\r\ntransferring himself from one Principal to another, the necessity of\r\ntheir acceptance of the landlord’s new tenant is obvious. Even after\r\nthe right of the Chancellor to nominate was fairly acknowledged, it was\r\nconsidered necessary that the students (graduate and undergraduate)\r\nshould be solemnly assembled in the Hall and required to elect the\r\nChancellor’s nominee, a formality which at Hart Hall lasted as long as\r\nthe Hall itself. The present Fellows of Hertford enjoy less autonomy\r\nthan the ancient students, and the Chancellor still enjoys an absolute\r\nright to appoint the Principal.\r\n\r\nIn 1312 the Hall, after some intermediate transfers, passed to Walter\r\nde Stapeldon, Bishop of Exeter. For some years before the acquisition\r\nof their present site, it was the habitation of the Rector and Scholars\r\nof Stapeldon Hall, now known as Exeter College. After this, Hart Hall\r\ncontinued to belong to them and was let to a Principal, usually one of\r\ntheir own Fellows. The rent varied from time to time till 1665, after\r\nwhich a fixed sum of £1 13_s._ 4_d._ continued to be paid, and it\r\nbecame a question whether prescription had not extinguished any further\r\nrights on the part of the College.\r\n\r\nAmong the “Principals” appear the first three Wardens of New College,\r\nRichard de Tonworthe (1378), Nicolas de Wykeham (1381), and Thomas\r\nde Cranleigh, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin (1384).[348] During\r\nthese years (probably 1375-1385) Hart and Black Halls were occupied\r\nby William of Wykeham’s New College, while their own buildings were\r\nin course of erection. There is, indeed, in the New College book of\r\n“Evidences” what purports to be a conveyance (dated 1379) of Hart Hall\r\nto William of Wykeham, under a quit-rent, by the Prioress and Convent\r\nof Studley. But from the documents of Exeter College it is clear that\r\nthe “capital lords” in actual possession were the Prior and Convent\r\nof S. Frideswyde’s.[349] Hence it would seem that the astute Bishop\r\nof Winchester was outwitted for once by the Nuns of Studley (who were\r\nreally proprietors of the adjoining Scheld Hall), and bought land with\r\na bad title.[350] Nuns had a great reputation as women of business.\r\n\r\nLater on the Hall was tenanted by a body of scholars supported by\r\nGlastonbury Abbey. At the dissolution a pension of £16 13_s._ 4_d._\r\nwas paid for the support of five scholars to Hart Hall, or rather to\r\nthe University on its behalf. The amount was at first a rent-charge\r\npayable, but not always paid, by the grantee of certain Abbey lands. At\r\nthe Restoration these lands were resumed by the Crown. The pension was\r\nstill paid at the end of the last century, but has now disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished man who can be fairly claimed as an _alumnus_\r\nof Hart Hall is the learned Selden (1600-1603), then “a long\r\nscabby-pol’d boy but a good student.” Ken, the saintly Bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, was apparently a member of the Hall for a few months while\r\nwaiting for a vacancy at New College. Sir Henry Wotton, one of the\r\nseventeenth century worthies immortalized by Izaac Walton, resided\r\nhere, though it would seem that he was not a member of the Hall but a\r\nGentleman-Commoner of New College.\r\n\r\nRichard Newton was born in the year 1675 or 1676, being a son of the\r\nsquire of Laundon, Bucks, a moderate estate to which he eventually\r\nsucceeded. He came up to Christ Church as a Westminster Student in\r\n1694. After being for a time a Tutor of that House, he became tutor\r\nto the two Pelhams, the future Duke of Newcastle and his brother. In\r\n1704 he was presented to the Rectory of Sudbury, Northants, by Bp.\r\nCompton. He was admitted Principal of Hart Hall, and took his D.D. in\r\n1710, continuing to hold Sudbury. He made his mark as a preacher; and\r\na number of pamphlets testify to his zeal as a University Reformer. In\r\n1726 he wrote against an undoubted abuse, the evasion of the statute\r\nagainst unauthorized migration, though it must be admitted that his\r\nzeal on that occasion was stimulated by a recent desertion from his\r\nown Hall. Another of his pamphlets is on the perennial subject of\r\nUniversity expensiveness. It is clear that in his own Hall he attempted\r\nto practise what he preached. In the pamphlets against him there are\r\nsneers against “a regimen of small-beer and apple-dumplings”--which (it\r\nis possible) had something to do with the frequent migrations of which\r\nthe Doctor had to complain, though we are told that in one case the\r\nattraction was a Balliol Scholarship, and in another the “fine garden”\r\nof Trinity which the deserter “hoped would be to the advantage of his\r\nhealth.” Eventually he even stopped the small-beer, holding that (as\r\nhe explains) more beer was drunk when it was got both in the Hall and\r\nout of it than when it could only be obtained outside. Newton was the\r\n“active” Head of his day, the “Monarch of Hart Hall” as the scoffers\r\nput it. He had pupils to travel or stay with him in “the Long,”\r\nusually “young gentlemen of fortune” in his College. He lamented\r\nthe indolence and inactivity, and was pained to observe “the secular\r\nviews and ambitious schemes” of other Heads. He held what was then\r\naccounted the eccentric opinion that “a gentleman-Commoner has a soul\r\nto be saved as well as a servitor, and is under the same obligations to\r\nreligion and virtue.” In confidential moments he would declare himself\r\nin favour of “Common-sense and Reason in matters of Religion”; and he\r\nappears to have practised a somewhat latitudinarian mode of meditation.\r\n“He[351] would, a little before bed-time, desire his young friends\r\nto indulge him in a short vacation of about half-an-hour for his own\r\nprivate recollections. During that little interval they were silent,\r\nand he would smoke his pipe with great composure, and then chat with\r\nthem again in a useful manner for a short space, and, bidding them\r\ngood night, go to his rest.” When resident on his living, he had daily\r\nservice at seven p.m. He was a Church Reformer as well as a University\r\nReformer, and wrote on “Pluralities Indefensible.” After his call\r\nto Oxford, he held his living as an absentee, but “never pocketed a\r\nfarthing of the profits thereof”; and eventually succeeded in resigning\r\nin favour of his curate. Altogether the life of Dr. Newton exhibits an\r\nexample of independence, honesty, and disinterestedness, rare indeed\r\namong the Churchmen of his time. Pelham gave it as his only reason for\r\nnot preferring his old tutor, that he could not do it “because he never\r\nasked me.” A man whom Pelham actually employed to write King’s Speeches\r\nfor him might certainly have been a Bishop for the asking. It was only\r\nin the year before his death (1752) that he got a Canonry at Christ\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hertford College_, 1740-1816.\r\n\r\nNewton had one ambition, and that was a disinterested one. “Dr. Newton\r\nis commonly said to be Founder-mad,” wrote the malicious Hearne; “Dr.\r\nNewton is very fond of founding a College,” wrote another, in 1721.\r\nThe patronage which he would not stoop to ask for himself, he sought\r\nto use for his College. But his grand friends did little for him;\r\nnearly all that he spent came out of his own pocket. He spent about\r\n£1500 on building a Chapel for the Hall (consecrated in 1716) and the\r\nadjoining corner of the present Quadrangle. He published an edition of\r\nTheophrastus by subscription for the benefit of his College, but it did\r\nnot appear till after his death. His proposals for the foundation of a\r\nCollege were made public in 1734 in a Letter to the Vice-Chancellor,\r\nthough he had already “made a noise” about it “many years.” Considering\r\nthe slenderness of the means at his disposal, it is not surprising\r\nthat the project encountered some ridicule. Hearne had at first been\r\nmuch impressed by the Doctor’s sermons, and styled him “an ingenious\r\nhonest man,” but on the appearance of his pamphlet on migration\r\npronounced him “quite mad with pride and conceit,” and the book a “very\r\nweak, silly performance.” Now he laments that “’tis pitty Charities\r\nand Benefactions should be discountenanced and obstructed; but it\r\nsometimes happens when the persons that make them are supposed to be\r\n_mente capti_ and aim at things in the settlement which are ridiculous,\r\nwhich seems to be the case at Hart Hall, as ’tis represented to me.\r\nHowever, after all,” the charitable critic concludes, “’tis better\r\nnot to publish the failings of persons, especially of clergymen, on\r\nsuch occasions, least mischief follow, the enemy being always ready to\r\ntake advantage.” The grant of the charter was long opposed by Exeter\r\nCollege: but the opinion of the Attorney-General was unfavourable to\r\nthe claim on the part of that College to anything but the accustomed\r\nrent. In 1740 Dr. Newton got his Charter of Incorporation, and his\r\nStatutes approved by George II.\r\n\r\nDr. Newton was not at all disposed to lose by his elevation to the\r\nHeadship of a College the autocracy which he had so long enjoyed as\r\nHead of a Hall. Hence, although he styles the four Tutors of the new\r\nFoundation “Senior Fellows” and their eight “Assistants” “Junior\r\nFellows,” the whole government of the College seems to be ultimately\r\nvested in the Principal, who was to be a Westminster student and Tutor\r\nof Christ Church nominated by the Dean of that House. There were to be\r\nno “idle fellowships” on Newton’s foundation: all were “official,” and\r\nlasted, the Senior Fellowships till the completion of eighteen years\r\nfrom Matriculation, the Junior only from B.A. to M.A. The College was\r\ndesigned for thirty-two “Students,” who enjoyed a modest endowment of\r\n£6 13_s._ 4_d._ for the first year and £13 6_s._ 8_d._ for four years\r\nmore, with commons. There were also four “Scholars” who were to act as\r\nServitors to the four Tutors, and to perform such functions as ringing\r\nthe bell and keeping the gate. Commoners and Gentleman-Commoners were\r\nexpressly excluded: but wealthier men might become honorary Scholars,\r\nwith leave to wear a “tuft” as well as the Scholar’s gown. Each Tutor\r\nwas to take charge of the freshmen of one year, who remained his\r\npupils throughout their course. This division of the College into four\r\nclasses must have been suggested by the Scotch University system, or\r\nby the arrangement of the French Colleges on which the Scotch system\r\nwas based. It was, at all events, vastly superior to the old “Tutorial\r\nsystem,” under which every Tutor played the polymathic Professor to\r\nUndergraduates of every year simultaneously.\r\n\r\nDr. Newton’s Statutes are very curious reading. He aimed at\r\nperpetuating the “system of education” which he had himself introduced.\r\nThey are full of wise provisions, some of them rather crotchety, and\r\nothers excellent in themselves but perhaps hardly practicable even\r\nthen. Each Tutor lived in a different “Angle” of the Quadrangle,\r\nand was responsible for its discipline. His post must have been no\r\nsinecure, if he was really to keep men out of each others’ rooms\r\nduring the hours of work, from Chapel (6.30 or 7.30 a.m. according\r\nto season) till the 12 o’clock dinner, and from 2 to 6 p.m. Supper\r\nwas at 7 instead of the usual 6 p.m., to limit the time available\r\nfor compotations. The gate was shut at 9 p.m., and after 10 the key\r\nwas to be taken to the Principal’s bed-room and no egress or ingress\r\npermitted. As an “educationist,” the Founder apparently believed in\r\nDisputations and insisted much on English composition, but disbelieved\r\nin verse-making except for “Undergraduates having a genius for\r\nPoetry.” The sumptuary regulations are somewhat severe, including the\r\nrequirement that no bills shall be “contracted without their Tutor’s\r\nknowledge and consent.” Allowances from parents were to be sent to\r\nthe Tutor, who was to pay his pupils’ debts before transmitting the\r\nremainder to their destination. “Dismission” was the penalty for\r\ncontracting a debt of more than 5_s._ “with any person keeping a\r\nCoffee-house or Cook’s-shop or any other Public House whatsoever.”\r\n\r\nNewton’s first two successors were men of mark in their day. William\r\nSharp (1753-1757) was Regius Professor of Greek. David Durell\r\n(1757-1775) was eminent as a Hebraist. But the Principalship depended\r\nfor its endowments entirely upon room-rent, and the Studentships\r\ncould never have been really paid out of Newton’s slender endowment\r\nof less than £60 _per annum_. The existence of the College depended\r\nupon the reputation of its Tutors. During the Tutorship[352] of\r\nNewcome, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, the College was still\r\nprosperous. His “pupils were for the most part men of family,” says\r\nSir George Trevelyan; among them, Charles James Fox (1764-1765). For a\r\nGentleman-Commoner (Dr. Newton’s Statutes were defied) Fox read hard,\r\nand found Mathematics “entertaining.” “Application like yours,” the\r\nTutor found it necessary to write to him, “requires some intermission,\r\nand you are the only person with whom I have ever had any connexion,\r\nin whom I could say this.” He read so hard in fact, that his father,\r\nLord Holland, sent him abroad without taking his degree, to the no\r\nsmall injury of his mind and character. It appears, however, that Fox’s\r\nlife had a lighter side even while at Oxford. In Lockhart’s story of\r\nReginald Dalton, we read: “Although Hart Hall has disappeared, we trust\r\nthe authorities have preserved the window from whence the illustrious\r\nC. J. Fox made the memorable leap when determined to join his\r\ncompanions in a Town and Gown row.” Alas! the window has disappeared\r\nnot only from the world of reality but (what does not always follow)\r\nfrom that of tradition!\r\n\r\nIt was in the time of the fourth Principal, Dr. Bernard Hodgson,\r\nthat the College collapsed. On his death in 1805 no one would accept\r\nthe almost honorary headship; but at last in 1814 the one surviving\r\nFellow,[353] who was (we are told) considered “half-cracked,” announced\r\nthat he had “nominated, constituted, and admitted himself Principal”!\r\nAt this time the place was all but deserted. It became a sort of no\r\nman’s land in which a score of “strange characters” (“as if being\r\n‘half-cracked’ were a qualification for admission”) squatted rent free.\r\nEventually the University took upon itself to close the building. In\r\n1820 the building adjoining Cat Street actually fell down “with a great\r\ncrash and a dense cloud of dust.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magdalen Hall_ (on this site), 1820-1874.\r\n\r\nOn January 9th, 1820, a fire deprived Magdalen Hall of its local\r\nhabitation.[354] The old Hall stood upon the site of the existing S.\r\nSwithin’s buildings, and belonged to the College from which it took\r\nits name. In 1816 the President and Fellows had procured an Act of\r\nParliament transferring the site and buildings of Hertford Society to\r\nMagdalen Hall, _i. e._ technically, to the University in trust for the\r\nHall. With part of the small property of the College, the Hertford\r\nScholarship was founded: the rest passed to the Society of Magdalen\r\nHall, which in 1822 took possession of its new home. A word must be\r\nsaid as to the traditions of which Hertford College thus became the\r\ninheritor.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1480 the Founder of Magdalen College built some rooms\r\nnear the gate of his College for the accommodation of the officers of\r\nhis Grammar School. To these other rooms were added, and the building\r\noccupied by students and called S. Mary Magdalen Hall. This Society\r\nhad at first the closest connection with the College, the Principal\r\nbeing always a Fellow. It was not till 1694 that the Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity finally established his right to nominate the Principal of\r\nMagdalen Hall.\r\n\r\nIt was in this Hall that the Ultra-Protestant traditions of Magdalen\r\nlingered after they had died out in the College itself. It had been\r\nwithin the walls of Magdalen Hall that the English Reformation had\r\nits true beginning in certain meetings for Bible-reading started by\r\nWilliam Tyndale, afterwards the translator of the Bible; and in the\r\nseventeenth century, when the Laudian movement had got the upper\r\nhand in the Colleges at large, it became a refuge for the oppressed\r\nPuritans. At one time it boasted three hundred members. In 1631 its\r\nPrincipal John Wilkinson, and Prideaux, Rector of Exeter, were summoned\r\nbefore the King in Council at Woodstock and received “a publick and\r\nsharp reprehension for their misgoverning and countenancing the\r\nfactious partie!” Soon after, Oxenbridge, one of its Tutors,[355] was\r\nconvicted of a “strange, singular, and superstitious way of dealing\r\nwith his Scholars by perswading and causing some of them to subscribe\r\nas votaries to several articles framed by himself (as he pretends, for\r\ntheir better government),” for which presumption he was “distutored.”\r\nIn 1640 Henry Wilkinson (also of the Hall) was suspended for preaching\r\nin a very bitter way against some of the ceremonies of the Church.[356]\r\nBut the day of vengeance came. When the Parliamentary Visitors came to\r\nOxford the suspended Tutor, Henry Wilkinson, senior, commonly known\r\nas “Long Harry,” was the most prominent and zealous of the Visitors.\r\nThe students of Magdalen Hall and New Inn submitted to a man, and the\r\nplaces of the ejected Fellows and Scholars were largely recruited\r\nfrom their numbers. A very large proportion of the eminent Puritans\r\nof the seventeenth century came from these two Halls. A few of the\r\ndistinguished Magdalen Hall men, whom Hertford College now claims as a\r\nsort of step-mother, may be added. John L’Isle, President of the High\r\nCourt of Justice; John Glynne, Lord Chief Justice of England under\r\nCromwell; William Waller, the Cromwellian Poet (afterwards at Hart\r\nHall); Sir Matthew Hale, the most famous of English Judges; Sydenham,\r\n“the English Hippocrates”; Sir Henry Vane; Pococke, the Orientalist;\r\nand Dr. John Wilkins, the Mathematician, afterwards Warden of Wadham,\r\nthen Master of Trin. Coll. Cambr., and later Bishop of Chester. Few\r\nColleges in the University ever sent out so many distinguished men\r\nwithin so short a time. But the greatest name that Magdalen Hall can\r\nboast figures oddly in this list of Puritan Worthies. Thomas Hobbes of\r\nMalmesbury entered when not quite fifteen in 1603, and went down in\r\n1607 with the B.A. degree. It is curious that it should have been by\r\nthe Puritan Principal, John Wilkinson, that the Philosopher of Erastian\r\nAbsolutism was introduced as tutor or companion into the Devonshire\r\nfamily with which he remained connected for the rest of his life. In\r\nspite of the Puritan _régime_, which was, however, hardly established\r\nin his day, Hobbes describes the place of his education as one “where\r\nthe young were addicted to drunkenness, wantonness, gaming, and other\r\nvices.” Clarendon was also a member of the Hall for a short time while\r\nwaiting for a Demyship at Magdalen College. Swift, whose Undergraduate\r\nlife was passed at Dublin, took his Oxford B.A. from Magdalen Hall in\r\n1692, and proceeded M.A. a few weeks later, during which interval we\r\nmay perhaps assume that he resided in the Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hertford College, founded 1874._\r\n\r\nThe last of the many vicissitudes which this venerable site has\r\nexperienced remains to be recorded. In 1874 the defunct Hertford\r\nCollege was recalled to life by the munificence of Mr. T. C.\r\nBaring, M.P., who endowed it with seventeen Fellowships, and thirty\r\nScholarships of £100 per annum, limited to members of the Church\r\nof England.[357] An Act of Parliament gave the new foundation “all\r\nsuch rights and privileges as are possessed or enjoyed or can be\r\nexercised by other Colleges in the University of Oxford;” and Dr.\r\nRichard Michell, the last Principal of Magdalen Hall, became the first\r\nPrincipal of the present Hertford College.\r\n\r\nWhile future ages will feel towards the name of Baring all the\r\nloyalty that is a Founders due, it is a fortunate circumstance that\r\nthe accidents which have been related enabled him to give to his new\r\nfoundation the only thing which money could not buy--a slight flavour\r\nof antiquity. The existing foundation is substantially the creation of\r\nMr. Baring, but enough remains of its predecessors--the Elizabethan\r\nhall now transformed into a Library, the Jacobean Common-rooms which\r\nrepresent the pre-Newtonian Hart Hall, Newton’s Chapel with the\r\nadjoining “angle,” the plate and pictures of Magdalen Hall and its ten\r\nScholarships[358]--to give us a link with the past, a not uninteresting\r\npast, of which, however glorious its future, the College need never be\r\nashamed. In one sense, notwithstanding the newness of its foundation,\r\nthe College belongs to the past more than its more venerable sisters.\r\nIt is untouched by recent legislation, its Statutes are constructed\r\nupon the old model, and it still rejoices in Fellowships which are\r\ntenable during life and celibacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nKEBLE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nBY REV. WALTER LOCK, M.A., SUB-WARDEN OF KEBLE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, the most recent of the Oxford colleges, was opened in 1870, the\r\nfoundation of it being due to a combination of three different but\r\ncognate causes: the first was a widespread desire to make University\r\neducation more widely accessible to the nation, and especially to those\r\nwho were anxious to take Holy Orders in the Church of England; the\r\nsecond, the desire to ensure that this education should be in the hands\r\nof Churchmen; and the third, the desire to perpetuate the memory of the\r\nRev. John Keble, formerly Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College, Professor\r\nof Poetry in the University (1832-1841), Vicar of Hursley (1836-1866),\r\nand author of _The Christian Year_, _Lyra Innocentium_, _A Treatise on\r\nEucharistical Adoration_, &c.\r\n\r\nOf these motives the first had been stirring in Oxford for many years.\r\nIn 1845 the following address was presented to the Hebdomadal Board--\r\n\r\n“Considerable efforts have lately been made in this country for the\r\ndiffusion of civil and spiritual knowledge, whether at home or abroad.\r\nSchools have been instituted for the lower and middle classes, churches\r\nbuilt and endowed, missionary societies established, further Schools\r\nfounded, as at Marlborough and Fleetwood, for the sons of poor clergy\r\nand others; and, again, associations for the provision of additional\r\nMinisters. But between these schools on the one hand, and on the other\r\nthe ministry which requires to be augmented, there is a chasm which\r\nneeds to be filled. Our Universities take up education where our\r\nschools leave it; yet no one can say that they have been strengthened\r\nor extended, whether for Clergy or Laity, in proportion to the growing\r\npopulation of the country, its increasing empire, or deepening\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n“We are anxious to suggest, that the link which we find thus missing\r\nin the chain of improvement should be supplied by rendering Academical\r\neducation accessible to the sons of parents whose incomes are too\r\nnarrow for the scale of expenditure at present prevailing among the\r\njunior members of the University of Oxford, and that this should be\r\ndone through the addition of new departments to existing Colleges,\r\nor, if necessary, by the foundation of new Collegiate bodies. We\r\nhave learned, on what we consider unquestionable information, that\r\nin such institutions, if the furniture were provided by the College,\r\nand public meals alone were permitted, to the entire exclusion of\r\nprivate entertainments in the rooms of the Students, the annual\r\nCollege payments for board, lodging, and tuition might be reduced to\r\n£60 at most; and that if frugality were enforced as the condition of\r\nmembership, the Student’s entire expenditure might be brought within\r\nthe compass of £80 yearly.\r\n\r\n“If such a plan of improvement be entertained by the authorities of\r\nOxford, the details of its execution would remain to be considered. On\r\nthese we do not venture to enter; but desire to record our readiness,\r\nwhenever the matter may proceed further, to aid, by personal exertions\r\nor pecuniary contributions, in the promotion of a design which the\r\nexigencies of the country so clearly seem to require.\r\n\r\n“Sandon, Ashley, R.

Marriott, deserves a special notice. In it he\r\npropounded a definite scheme for the foundation of a college either\r\nin or out of Oxford, which should contain about one hundred students\r\nliving “a somewhat domestic kind of life,” which should be shared in\r\nclose intercourse by their tutors. Mr. Marriott received considerable\r\npromises of help towards the endowment of such a college, but his\r\nearly death cut short the scheme.[360] The University Commission of\r\n1854 tended to stimulate the desire to make University education\r\nmore national; but it was not until 1865 that any definite step was\r\ntaken. On Nov. 16 of that year a meeting of graduates was held at\r\nOriel College, “to consider the question of University Extension with\r\na view especially to the education of persons needing assistance and\r\ndesirous of admission into the Christian ministry.” The conveners of\r\nthis meeting were chiefly influenced by the belief that the education\r\nof the national clergy was the unquestionable duty of the Universities,\r\nbut that it was to a large extent passing out of their hands. They\r\nrecognized, however, that this was far from the sole ground of\r\nUniversity Extension, and especially urged that the system of Local\r\nExaminations required as its natural complement some further movement\r\nwhich should enable the successful candidates to follow out their\r\nstudies at the University itself. At this meeting six sub-committees\r\nwere formed to consider various methods of such extension. The history\r\nof Keble College is concerned only with the first of these, of which\r\nDr. Shirley, the Professor of Ecclesiastical History, was Chairman, the\r\nother members being Professors Bernard, Burrows, Mansel, Pusey, and the\r\nRevs. W. Burgon, R. Greswell, W. Ince, and J. Riddell.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to them were to consider the suggestion of\r\nextending the University “by founding a college or hall on a large\r\nscale, with a view not exclusively but especially to the education of\r\npersons needing assistance and desirous of admission into the Christian\r\nministry.” The substance of the report was to the effect that, without\r\ninterfering with either the moral and religious discipline or the\r\nsocial advantages of an academical life, it would be possible very\r\nconsiderably to reduce the average of expenditure. With this purpose\r\nthey suggest the building of a new Hall, by private subscription, large\r\nenough to hold one hundred undergraduates; for the sake of economy\r\nthe rooms should be smaller than in most colleges, they should be\r\narranged along corridors instead of by staircases, and be furnished\r\nby the College; breakfast as well as dinner should be taken in\r\ncommon, caution-money and entrance fees abolished, and all necessary\r\nexpenditure included in one terminal payment. By this means it was\r\nhoped that the University would be opened to a class of men who cannot\r\nnow enter, but without placing them apart from the classes who now\r\navail themselves of it. The Hall was not to be “such an eleemosynary\r\nestablishment as would be sought only by persons of inferior social\r\nposition, less cultivated manners, or of attainments and intellect\r\nbelow the ordinary level of the University, but rather one which is\r\nadapted to the natural tastes and habits of gentlemen wishing to live\r\neconomically.”[361]\r\n\r\nIn the following year (on March 16, 1866) the Rev. John Keble died,\r\nand on the day of his funeral it seemed to his friends that the most\r\nfitting memorial to him would be to build such a college as had been\r\ncontemplated by this committee. Mr. Keble had himself joined in the\r\nmovement which led to the appointment of the committee; he had seen and\r\napproved the Report. This report was accordingly taken as the basis\r\nof action. The details were, in the main, arranged upon its lines;\r\nperhaps the chief difference was that from the first the preparation\r\nof candidates for Holy Orders was less insisted upon, and more\r\nemphasis was laid upon the duty of providing a suitable education for\r\nall Churchmen, whatever their vocation might be. To quote the words\r\nof the appeal which was issued, “The College was intended first to\r\nbe a heartfelt and national tribute of affection and admiration to\r\nthe memory of one of the most eminent and religious writers whom the\r\nChurch of England has ever produced, one whose holy example was perhaps\r\neven a greater power for good than his _Christian Year_; secondly, to\r\nmeet the great need now so generally felt of some form of University\r\nExtension, which may include a large portion of persons at present\r\ndebarred through want of means from its full benefits; while, thirdly,\r\nit is hoped that it will prove, by God’s blessing, the loyal handmaid\r\nof our mother Church, to train up men who, not in the ministry only\r\nbut in the manifold callings of the Christian life, shall be steadfast\r\nin the faith.”[362] The aims of the promoters of Keble College were,\r\nin a word, exactly the same as those of the munificent founders of the\r\nearlier colleges, viz. to extend University education to those who\r\ncould not otherwise enjoy it, to extend it in the form of collegiate\r\nlife, and in loyalty to the English Church.\r\n\r\nA public appeal for subscriptions was at once made, and these amounted\r\nin a very short time to more than £50,000. The building of the College\r\nwas intrusted to Mr. Butterfield. On St. Mark’s Day (the anniversary\r\nof Mr. Keble’s birthday), 1868, the first stone was laid by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Longley); and rooms for one hundred\r\nundergraduates and six tutors were ready for occupation in 1870, and at\r\nCommemoration the first Warden, the Rev. E. S. Talbot, senior student\r\nof Christ Church, was formally installed by the Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity. A council had already been elected by the subscribers: this\r\nconstitutes the Governing Body of the College, and perpetuates itself\r\nby co-optation as vacancies arise. The Council elect the Warden, who\r\nnominates the Tutors. On June 6th a Royal Charter of Incorporation was\r\ngranted. This, after reciting that the subscribers had joined together\r\nto give public and permanent expression to their feeling of deep\r\ngratitude for the long and devoted services of the Rev. John Keble to\r\nthe Church of Christ, and with that intent had resolved to establish a\r\ncollege or institution in which young men now debarred from University\r\neducation might be trained in simple and religious habits, according\r\nto the principles of the Church of England, created the Warden,\r\nCouncil, and scholars into a corporate body with power to hold lands\r\nnot exceeding the value of five thousand pounds (A subsequent amendment\r\nof the Mortmain Act, passed by Parliament in August 1888, extended to\r\nKeble College the exemption of the Mortmain Act, by which persons are\r\nenabled to bequeath property to it.) This Royal Charter carried with it\r\nno academical privileges. It left the Council free to move the College\r\nelsewhere, or even to wind up the Corporation; at the same time it\r\nauthorized them, if they saw fit, to obtain the incorporation of the\r\nCollege within the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, the course actually adopted; the question of\r\nformal incorporation was not free from difficulties, as in previous\r\ncases such incorporation had been generally effected either by Royal\r\nCharter or by an Act of Parliament, and so it has never been raised.\r\nWhat actually happened was as follows. On June 16th, 1870, a decree was\r\npassed by Convocation, authorizing the Vice-Chancellor to matriculate\r\nstudents from Keble College pending further legislation. On March 9th,\r\n1871, a new statute dealing with New Foundations for Academical Study\r\nand Education was passed, and on April 8th Keble College was admitted\r\nto the privileges granted by it. By this statute all its members have\r\nin relation to the University the same privileges and obligations as\r\nif they had been admitted to one of the previously existing Colleges\r\nor Halls, and the Warden has with regard to the members of his society\r\nthe same obligations, rights, and powers as are assigned to the heads\r\nof existing Colleges or Halls, though the statute does not impose\r\nupon him any other obligations or confer any other right, privilege,\r\nor distinction. Any other statutes in which Colleges are mentioned by\r\nname, such as those respecting the University sermons or the election\r\nof Proctors, would not apply to any such new foundations, unless\r\nso amended as to include them expressly. The statute affecting the\r\nProctorial cycle was so amended in 1887, and Keble College was for that\r\npurpose placed on a level with other colleges. The further question\r\nwhether the head of such a society possesses the rights possessed by\r\nthe heads of the earlier colleges has never been decided.[363]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the College had been opened successfully in Michaelmas Term\r\n1870. At that time the north, east, and west blocks were completed,\r\nwith a temporary chapel and hall on the south. The rooms were arranged\r\nin corridors, but subsequent experience has since partly modified\r\nthis arrangement. The quadrangle south of the gateway was commenced\r\nin 1873, and finished on the eastern side in 1875, on the western in\r\n1882. In 1873 W. Gibbs, Esq., of Tynterfield, laid the foundation of\r\nthe permanent Chapel, of which he was the sole and munificent donor.\r\nThis was formally opened on St. Mark’s Day, 1876, and on the same day\r\nthe foundation-stone of the Hall and Library was laid, these being the\r\nscarcely less munificent gifts of his sons, Messrs. Antony and Martin\r\nGibbs. The architect of these buildings also was Mr. Butterfield. In\r\nthe Chapel, the general aim of the decoration is to set forth the\r\nChrist as the sum and centre of all history, to whom all previous ages\r\npointed, from whom all subsequent ages have drawn their inspiration.\r\nIn the main body of the Chapel the mosaics represent typical scenes\r\nfrom the lives of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses, while the great\r\nprophets and kings of the Old Testament are portrayed in the windows.\r\nAround the Sanctuary the ornament is richer as it attempts to do honour\r\nto the fact of the Incarnation--alabaster and marble take the place of\r\nstone. On either side in the mosaics are seen the Annunciation, the\r\nBirth, the Baptism, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection of the Lord; in\r\nthe windows the leading Apostles and Doctors of the Christian Church.\r\nThe Ascension is given in the east window; while in the quatre-foil\r\nmosaic, the centre of the whole decoration, appears a vision of the\r\nLord Himself as described by St. John in the Apocalypse, seated in the\r\nmidst of the candlesticks, with the stars in His hand, and the sword\r\ncoming out of His mouth. Around the Living Lord are grouped saints of\r\nall the Christian centuries and of every vocation in life. The western\r\nmosaic closes the series with the Last Judgment.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the arrangement differs from that of all the other\r\nCollege chapels--all the seats are ranged eastwards, not north and\r\nsouth. This results from the change which has passed over college\r\nlife in Oxford. The earlier chapels were built for colleges in which\r\nevery one was in theory a life-member on the foundation, and had\r\nhis permanent seat as in a cathedral body; but a modern college\r\nchapel, containing almost exclusively a large passing congregation of\r\nundergraduates, presents conditions much more like that of an ordinary\r\nchurch, and alike for purposes of worship and of preaching it seemed\r\nbetter that the whole body should face eastward in the usual manner.\r\nIt should also be mentioned that the chapel has not been formally\r\nconsecrated, it being a question whether such consecration might not\r\nlimit the powers conferred upon the Council by the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe Hall and Library were formally opened in 1878, Mr. Gladstone being\r\namong the speakers on the occasion. Since then the Hall has been\r\nenriched with a beautiful oil painting of the Rev. J. Keble, painted\r\nby G. Richmond after Mr. Keble’s death from a crayon drawing which he\r\nhad made in his lifetime; by portraits of Archbishop Longley, who laid\r\nthe foundation stone of the College; of Dr. Shirley, Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on whose report the College was based; of Earl Beauchamp, the\r\nsenior member of the Council, from the first one of the most strenuous\r\nand munificent friends of the College; of the Rev. E. S. Talbot, the\r\nfirst Warden (1870-1888); of W. Gibbs, Esq., the donor of the Chapel;\r\nand of J. A. Shaw Stewart, Esq., the treasurer of the original Memorial\r\nFund and resident Bursar of the College (1876-1880). To these is to be\r\nadded soon a portrait of Dr. Liddon, member of the Council (1870-1890),\r\nand of the Rev. Aubrey L. Moore, Tutor (1881-1890). In addition to\r\nthese, all of which are connected with the College history, Earl\r\nBeauchamp has presented a portrait of Archbishop Laud.\r\n\r\nIn the Library the nucleus of the collection was formed by the gift\r\nof the majority of Mr. Keble’s own books and many of his MSS.,\r\npresented mainly by his brother, partly also by his nephew. Among\r\nthese are the original drafts of the _Lyra Innocentium_ and many of\r\nthe _Miscellaneous Poems_ (written on stray scraps of paper or on\r\nbacks of envelopes), of the _Eucharistical Adoration_, the sermons on\r\nBaptism, and the translation of St. Irenæus; and, most interesting of\r\nall, a fair copy made by himself of the greater part of the _Christian\r\nYear_, written in an exquisitely clear and delicate hand in seven\r\nsmall note-books. Other relics of Mr. Keble, including his study-table\r\nand the candelabrum presented to him by his pupils on leaving Oxford,\r\nare preserved in the common room. The Library has also received large\r\ndonations or legacies of books from Cardinal Newman, Archbishop Trench,\r\nLord Richard Cavendish, Miss Yonge, &c. Quite recently there has been\r\nadded to it Dr. Liddon’s library, rich especially in historical,\r\nliturgical, and theological books, and containing also an excellent\r\ncollection of Dante literature. Mr. Holman Hunt’s picture, _The Light\r\nof the World_, presented by Mrs. Combe of the University Press, at\r\npresent hangs in the Library, though it will probably be ultimately\r\ntransferred to the chapel.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the internal working of the College there is little\r\nto say. From the opening till the present its rooms have always been\r\nfull; and clear proof has thus been given of the reality of the demand\r\nfor University extension on such a plan. The annual charge to each\r\nundergraduate is £82 a year, which includes tuition, board, and rent\r\nof furnished rooms; groceries, wines, &c. have been supplied from the\r\nCollege stores; and a special common room is open to undergraduates,\r\nserving both for entertainment and as a reading-room. Two of those\r\nwho have worked as tutors in the College have already been raised to\r\nthe Episcopate--Dr. Mylne, the Senior Tutor in the first years of the\r\nCollege, now Bishop of Bombay, and Dr. Jayne, now Bishop of Chester.\r\n\r\nIn academical distinction the College has quite held its own with\r\nmany of the older Colleges, and has specially gained distinction in\r\nthe Honour Schools of Theology, Modern History, and Natural Science.\r\nSeveral private benefactions, notably those of Miss Wilbraham (1872),\r\nMrs. William Gibbs (1875), A. J. Balfour, Esq., M.P. (1875), Lady\r\nGomm (1878), Miss Chafyn Grove (1879), H. O. Wakeman, Esq. (1882),\r\nand a subscription raised to found a “Caroline Talbot” Scholarship in\r\nmemory of the first Warden’s mother, have enabled the College to offer\r\nseveral scholarships for open competition to members of the Church\r\nof England, or to aid those who are already members of the College\r\nto complete their career. There are also special prizes to encourage\r\nthe study of theology, such as the Wills and Phillpott’s prizes for\r\nundergraduates, the Liddon prize, and the “Edward Talbot” studentship,\r\nfounded to commemorate the services of the first Warden, for graduates;\r\nbut these are all the endowments that the College has, and they are\r\nnot sufficient to enable it to compete on equal terms with the other\r\ncolleges in the offer of scholarships.\r\n\r\nThe College has also received many advowsons, and is likely to do\r\nuseful service to the Church of England as patron of livings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] From the old printed copy in Bodl.

It is now inclosed within the site of the College.\r\n\r\n[125] From the _Life of Conant_, by his son.\r\n\r\n[126] The “moderator” presided over the disputation, seeing that the\r\ndisputants observed the rules of reasoning, and giving his opinion on\r\nthe discussion, and on the arguments which had been advanced in it, in\r\na concluding speech.\r\n\r\n[127] John Conybeare, Fellow of Exeter, 1710; Rector, 1730; Dean of\r\nChrist Church, 1733; Bishop of Bristol, 1750.\r\n\r\n[128] The pre-eminence of Merton, its conspicuous buildings, and its\r\nwealth, seem to have distinguished it as “the College,” until it found\r\na rival in the “New College” of William of Wykeham.\r\n\r\n[129] The seal at present in use is believed to be the original seal of\r\nthe College. The upper part represents the Annunciation; below under an\r\narcade is the kneeling figure of Adam de Brome. Round the edge is the\r\nlegend “Sy. Comune Domus Scholarium Beate Marie Oxon.”\r\n\r\nThe only other memorial of its foundation which the College possesses\r\nis its founder’s cup, given to it, according to the College tradition,\r\nby King Edward the Second; though an entry in the Treasurer’s accounts\r\nrecording the purchase in December 1493 for £4 18_s._ 1_d._, of a\r\nstanding gilt cup marked with E and S, and a cover to the same, is in\r\nfavour of its belonging to a later date.\r\n\r\n[130] The Hospital itself was also intended to be a place to which\r\nmembers of the Society could remove, in case of sickness or pestilence,\r\ninto a purer air than that of Oxford.\r\n\r\n[131] To enable the College to take these additional endowments, a\r\nfurther license in mortmain to the extent of ten pounds a year was\r\ngranted, 14th March, 1327.\r\n\r\n[132] See page 94.\r\n\r\n[133] Hawkesworth was one of the first Fellows of Queen’s, nominated by\r\nthe original Statutes in 1341; but as the ground on which his election\r\nwas annulled is expressly stated to be its informality and not any\r\ndefect in the person chosen, he was probably also connected with the\r\nCollege either as Fellow or ex-Fellow. He appears as acting on the\r\nCollege behalf in 1341.\r\n\r\n[134] It has been printed in the Oxford Historical Society’s\r\n_Collectanea_, vol. i. p. 59.\r\n\r\n[135] In Wood’s list, both Symon and Byrche are entered as of\r\nUniversity College; but there is little doubt that they both belonged\r\nto Oriel.\r\n\r\n[136] These two manors adjoin one another, but are entirely independent\r\nand in distinct parishes; they appear, however, as held together at the\r\ntime of the Domesday Survey, and never to have parted company since\r\nthat date.\r\n\r\n[137] In his account of this building Wood must for once have fallen\r\nasleep, or he would not have suggested that the letters O. C. (Oriel\r\nCollege) were inscribed by “the Saints, in honour of their great\r\nCommander.” But such is the vitality of error that this absurd blunder\r\nis copied without correction into every guide-book for Oxford, and\r\nactually reappears in the note prefixed to a very careful account of\r\nthe Hospital, published by the Oxford Architectural Society.\r\n\r\n[138] _I. e._ take this, and prosper.

The dates are of election\r\nto Fellowship. Sir William Wightman, Justice of the Court of Queen’s\r\nBench, and Henry John Chitty Harper, Metropolitan of New Zealand, were\r\nalso on this foundation, but never Fellows.\r\n\r\n[146] Those reading “Logic,” termed “sophistae.”\r\n\r\n[147] “Artista,” a student (here probably a Master) in the faculty of\r\nArts.\r\n\r\n[148] Students not yet advanced to the study of Logic.\r\n\r\n[149] The study of theology began two years after the attainment of the\r\nM.A. degree.\r\n\r\n[150] See Tobie Matthew’s letter to Lord Burghley in _State Papers,\r\nAddenda_, Elizabeth, xxxii. 89, Oct. 16, 1593, and Boast’s life in\r\n_Dict. of Nat.

Among these, but only for a very\r\nshort time, was the Sir Henry Wotton who still lives in Izaac Walton’s\r\n_Lives_.\r\n\r\n[158] G. V. Cox, _Recollections of Oxford_ (1870), p. 50.\r\n\r\n[159] These “Sunday pence” were paid in all Oxford parishes. In 1525\r\npayment was disputed; and in the test case between Lincoln College,\r\nas rector of All Saints church, and William Potycarye alias Clerke of\r\nAll Saints parish, payment was enforced under penalty of “the greater\r\nexcommunication.” Several tenements in Oxford continue to this day to\r\npay to their parish church quit-rents of 4_s._ 8_d._ representing these\r\nold “Sunday pence.” Their owners have the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nthese tenements represent the most ancient holdings in Oxford.\r\n\r\n[160] On 13th Dec., 1432, in the time of the first rector, the\r\ncelebrated Thomas Gascoigne gave twelve MSS. to the library.\r\n\r\n[161] Mr. Maxwell Lyte, in his _History of the University of Oxford_,\r\nhas taken for the original the seventeenth century copy on the south\r\nside of the quadrangle, which was put there by a married Head to cloak\r\nhis annexation of College rooms.\r\n\r\n[162] In memory of this occasion the vine was probably planted which in\r\nLoggan’s picture (1675) is seen spreading over the west front of the\r\nhall; the successors of which in the chapel quadrangle and the kitchen\r\npassage still in sunny years bear plentiful clusters.\r\n\r\n[163] Robert Parkinson, _ut supra_. Rotheram’s arms are carved on the\r\nnorth wall of this building. In the herald’s certificate of 1574, they\r\nare given as “vert, three stags trippant two and one or.” They are\r\nnowadays generally blazoned wrongly.\r\n\r\n[164] The final deed of incorporation is dated 20th Nov., 1478.\r\n\r\n[165] Among the rest Dagville’s Inn (now the Mitre), which was already\r\nan ancient inn when Dagville inherited it from his uncle.\r\n\r\n[166] The provocation was both wanton and fatuous. On 24th Aug., 1717,\r\nCrewe began to execute in his lifetime the provisions of his will,\r\nviz. to pay to the Rector £20 per annum, to each of the twelve Fellows\r\nand to each of the four Chaplains £10 per annum, to the bible-clerk\r\nand eight Scholars together £54 6_s._ 8_d._ per annum; and to each of\r\ntwelve Exhibitioners founded by him £20 per annum. On the 27th June,\r\n1719, the Rectorship fell vacant; the Fellows asked Crewe to state who\r\nhe wished to succeed. He twice refused; but on being asked the third\r\ntime said, “William Lupton,” Fellow since 1698. On 18th July, 1719, the\r\nFellows, by nine votes to three, elected into the Rectorship not Lupton\r\nbut John Morley!\r\n\r\n[167] In 1537 the full number of Rector, twelve Foundation and three\r\nDarby Fellows is found; again in 1587; and again in 1595. In 1606 the\r\nVisitor allows the number of Fellows to be twelve only, and thereafter\r\nthat number is never exceeded.\r\n\r\n[168] Of the three persons nominated by Darby in 1538 as his first\r\nFellows, two, William Villers (his kinsman) and Richard Gill, were\r\nundergraduates. One nomination of this kind was eminently unsuccessful;\r\nWalter Pitts, nominated by the Visitor in 1568 to the Darby Fellowship\r\nfor Oxfordshire, was removed in 1573 because he had repeatedly\r\nfailed to get his degree. The Parliamentary Visitors in 1650 put\r\nundergraduates into Fellowships in Lincoln College; one of these, John\r\nTaverner, in 1652 was fined 13_s._ 4_d._, “for swearing two oaths, as\r\ndid appear upon testimony.”\r\n\r\n[169] When the number of Fellowships was reduced by treating the\r\nthree Darby Fellowships not as additional to, but as taking the place\r\nof three of, the Foundation Fellowships, the Stowe Fellowship was\r\nsubstituted for one of the Lincoln county Fellowships, the other two\r\nfor two of the Lincoln diocese Fellowships. With this modification the\r\nregulations about counties and dioceses were very faithfully observed\r\nin elections to Fellowships, until these limitations were all swept\r\naway by the Commission of 1854.\r\n\r\n[170] The Visitor (John Williams, who had built the new chapel), in\r\n1631, discontinued this (except the procession on All Saints day).\r\nThe procession on All Saints day has been discontinued under another\r\nVisitor’s Order of 6th Feb., 1867.\r\n\r\n[171] These two services were changed at the Reformation to a sermon;\r\nthe appointment of a preacher for this sermon was discontinued about\r\n1750.\r\n\r\n[172] The first of these sermons was assigned to the Rector by statute,\r\nthe second by custom.\r\n\r\n[173] The earliest College duty assigned to John Wesley, after his\r\nelection to a Fellowship at Lincoln, was to preach the St. Michael’s\r\nsermon on Michaelmas Day 1726.\r\n\r\n[174] B.A. Fellows might not have theological works, but only works in\r\nphilosophy and logic.\r\n\r\n[175] Rectors, suffering under the despotism of too efficient\r\nSubrectors, have accused this officer of mis-spelling his alternative\r\ntitle and regarding himself as _Co-rector_.\r\n\r\n[176] The barber’s duties were at first to supply the clean shave, the\r\ntonsure, and the close crop which became “clerks.” In later ages more\r\nextravagant fashions in hair added to his labour. At the close of the\r\neighteenth century he had to dress for dinner the heads of all the\r\nCollege in the pomp of powder and the vanity of queue. Beginning about\r\nnoon with the junior Commoner, he concluded with the senior Fellow\r\non the stroke of three, when the bell rang for dinner. The higher,\r\ntherefore, you were in College standing, the longer was the time\r\navailable for your morning walk, and the ampler the gossip of the day\r\nwith which you were entertained.\r\n\r\n[177] If any one wishes a modern parallel, he may note how Oxford\r\nbecame filled with Jacobites ejected from their country cures within\r\ntwo or three years of the imposition of the Oath of Allegiance to\r\nWilliam and Mary.\r\n\r\n[178] Their Catholic sympathies are evident from the Colleges to which\r\nthey made their benefactions. Neither in Lincoln College under John\r\nBridgwater, nor in Caius College under John Caius, was a young Romanist\r\nin any danger of being converted to Protestantism.\r\n\r\n[179] Several entries show that their position was inferior to that of\r\na Commoner, and involved menial service in College. In 1661 we have an\r\nentry--“Whereas Henry Rose, a scholar, did lately officiate as porter,\r\nand had no allowance for his pains,” he is to be excused the College\r\nfee for taking B.A. In Feb. 1661-2 these Traps’ exhibitioners were\r\nexempted from some College charges on consideration of their waiting at\r\nthe Fellows’ table.\r\n\r\n[180] As “Commissary,” _i. e._ Vice-chancellor, of the University\r\nfrom 1527 to 1532, Cottisford had been set to several painful pieces\r\nof duty, in the discovery and arrest of Lutheran members of the\r\nUniversity. Thus in 1527 Thomas Garret was arrested by the Proctors and\r\nimprisoned in Cottisford’s rooms: but his friends stole into College\r\nwhen Cottisford, with the rest of the College, was in chapel at Evening\r\nPrayers, and enabled him to effect his escape. This “Lollard’s” ghost,\r\noddly enough, was at one time supposed to haunt the gateway-tower.\r\n\r\n[181] On only two other occasions is this silence broken; the next is\r\nin 1633, when the register notes that the King was at Woodstock, and\r\nthat the Rector had forbidden undergraduates to go there; the latest\r\nis a notice of the grief of the nation on the death of the Princess\r\nCharlotte, and of the services in the College chapel on the day of her\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n[182] There is some suspicion that about this time the Government had\r\na paid spy in College. In Sept. 1566 an Anthony Marcham, of Lincoln\r\nCollege, writes to Cecil asking money, otherwise he will be unable to\r\nstay on in Oxford (_Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series_).\r\n\r\n[183] There is, of course, the usual legend that Rotheram built this\r\naddition as “conscience-money” for his defalcations as Bursar.\r\n\r\n[184] The Rotherams of Luton in Bedfordshire were descended from the\r\nArchbishop’s brother, to whom he had bequeathed that estate.\r\n\r\n[185] Baker’s _History of St. John’s, Cambridge_ (edit. Mayor), p. 208.\r\n\r\n[186] The intrusive dog occurs several times in College orders.\r\nThe most noteworthy entry is perhaps that of 30th June, 1726:--“No\r\ngentleman-commoner, or commoner, whether graduate or undergraduate,\r\nshall keep a dog within the College. The Bursar is required to see that\r\nall dogs be kept out of the Hall at meal-times.”\r\n\r\n[187] Previously, the College meetings had been held in the Rector’s\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\n[188] The rooms which Wesley occupied in College are said, by\r\ntradition, to be those over the passage from the first quadrangle into\r\nthe chapel quadrangle.\r\n\r\n[189] This sermon, esquire-bedell G. V. Cox notes, was “two and a half\r\nhours long,” and the sitting it out made a vacancy in the headship of a\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n[190] Tatham’s broad Yorkshire dialect gave a tone of vigorous\r\nrusticity to his speech.\r\n\r\n[191] I understand that it was not destroyed, but passed into private\r\npossession. The recovery, after so many years, of the Brasenose “brasen\r\nnose” forbids Lincoln to despair of yet getting back its overseer.\r\n\r\n[192] Throughout this chapter I must acknowledge my indebtedness to\r\nProfessor Burrows’ invaluable _Worthies of All Souls_. I must also\r\nmention that both the Warden of All Souls and Professor Burrows have\r\nbeen good enough to look through these pages, and have kept me from\r\nmany pitfalls. The Warden furnished me with much information in the\r\nlater pages of this chapter which would have been quite inaccessible\r\nwithout his help.\r\n\r\n[193] _Worthies_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[194] Capi-tolium. A horrible derivation!\r\n\r\n[195] See page 226.\r\n\r\n[196] The effigy on Richard Patten’s monument has been described as\r\nshowing the dress of a merchant; but there does not seem to be anything\r\nin the costume which would indicate unmistakably the status of the\r\nwearer. The monument, formerly in the old Church of All Saints at\r\nWainfleet, was removed to Oxford by the Society of Magdalen College to\r\npreserve it from destruction on the demolition of the church, in 1820.\r\nIt is now placed in the little oratory on the north side of the choir\r\nof the College chapel.\r\n\r\n[197] This Hall is of course to be distinguished from the later society\r\nof the same name, which was at first a dependency of Magdalen College,\r\nand afterwards became a separate foundation.\r\n\r\n[198] Another duty incumbent upon the members of the Hospital was the\r\npreaching of a sermon _ad populum_ on St. John Baptist’s Day. This,\r\nwith certain other duties, was transferred to the College. The sermon\r\nwas at one time preached as a rule from the stone pulpit in the corner\r\nof what is now called St. John’s Quadrangle; but the stone pulpit was\r\nnot always employed even in early times. Thus in 1495 there is a record\r\nof a payment of 4_d._ to “four poor scholars” for bringing a pulpit\r\nfrom New College for St. John Baptist’s Day, and taking it back again.\r\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century the sermon was preached\r\nin the chapel if the day chanced to be wet; and what was then the\r\nexception has become the rule.\r\n\r\n[199] This name was given to the scholars who received half the\r\nallowance given to Fellows. It appears to have been in current use at\r\nthe time when the founder’s statutes were drawn up.\r\n\r\n[200] This priory, originally a dependency of St. Florence at Saumur,\r\nwas made “denizen” in 1396, before the alien priories were suppressed.\r\n\r\n[201] An Augustinian Priory, founded by Peter des Roches, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, in 1233. It was suppressed by Waynflete, after several\r\nattempts had been made to reform it.\r\n\r\n[202] Neither the benefaction of Henry VII. nor his annual\r\ncommemoration has any connection with the custom of singing a Latin\r\nhymn on the Tower at sunrise on May-day. Two accounts of the origin of\r\nthis custom, which allege such a connection, have often been repeated\r\nand sometimes confused: (1) That Mass was formerly said at an early\r\nhour on May 1st upon the top of the Tower for Henry VII., and that the\r\nhymn is a survival from this service. (2) That the sum paid by the\r\nRectory of Slymbridge to the College was intended for the maintenance\r\nof the custom of singing on the Tower. Of the first of these accounts\r\nit may be said that there is no evidence of any celebration of Mass on\r\nthe Tower (a thing _à priori_ highly improbable) at any time; and that\r\nthe hymn, which now forms part of the College “Grace,” is probably a\r\ncomposition of the seventeenth century, and is certainly not part of\r\nthe Requiem Mass according to the rite of Sarum, or any other rite. Of\r\nthe second account it may be said that the deeds relating to Slymbridge\r\nshow clearly that the payment was not intended for this purpose, to\r\nwhich it was never applied. The present custom of singing the hymn\r\nfrom the “Grace” originated, it is believed, in the last century on\r\nan occasion when the former custom of performing secular music on the\r\nTower was interrupted by bad weather. The hymn was probably chosen as a\r\nsubstitute because the choir were perfectly familiar with its words and\r\nmusic. The details of the ceremony as it is at present performed were\r\narranged about fifty years from the present time.\r\n\r\n[203] The Tower was begun in 1492, and finished in 1507. The theory\r\nwhich ascribes to Wolsey the credit of being its designer rests on no\r\nsecure foundation. At the time when it was begun he was not more than\r\ntwenty-one years of age. The legend that he left Oxford in consequence\r\nof some misapplication of the College funds in connection with this\r\nwork, is perhaps still less trustworthy. He was twice bursar during the\r\nprogress of the building, being third bursar in 1498 and senior bursar\r\nin 1499-1500. In the former year he also held the post of Master of\r\nthe College School, and was for some time absent from Oxford, acting\r\nas tutor to the sons of the Marquis of Dorset. The accounts for this\r\nyear are preserved, and show no sign of any transaction of the kind\r\nalleged. The accounts of 1499-1500 are now lost; but it may be remarked\r\nthat in 1500 Wolsey was appointed to the office of Dean of Divinity,\r\nwhich would hardly have been the case if the College had had reason to\r\ncomplain of his conduct as bursar.\r\n\r\n[204] Some members of the College, including apparently several of\r\nthose who had withdrawn at the accession of Mary, were ejected by Bp.\r\nGardiner at a Visitation in 1553.\r\n\r\n[205] There is an interesting brass in the College chapel bearing the\r\neffigy of President Cole, now concealed by the steps at the lectern.\r\n\r\n[206] The elms now in the grove were planted soon after the\r\nRestoration, in 1661 or 1662. The walks round the meadow were laid out\r\nin their present shape rather later.\r\n\r\n[207] Frewen was one of the few bishops who outlived the Commonwealth\r\nperiod. He was afterwards Archbishop of York. Warner, Bishop of\r\nRochester, another of the bishops who returned from exile, was also\r\na member of Magdalen College, and a considerable benefactor to its\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n[208] This organ is now, or was till quite lately, in the Abbey Church\r\nat Tewkesbury. Cromwell has left a curious memorial of his presence in\r\na note written on the fly-leaf of a copy of Bp. Hall’s Treatises, still\r\nin the College Library.\r\n\r\n[209] _Spectator_, No. 494.\r\n\r\n[210] The names of those who returned are engraved on a cup known as\r\nthe “Restoration Cup,” which is used as a “Grace-cup” in the Hall\r\non the 29th of May. The same cup is used on the 25th of October to\r\ncommemorate the Restoration of the President and Fellows, who were\r\nejected in 1687, and restored just before the Revolution, on Oct. 25th,\r\n1688. The same “toast” is employed on both occasions--_Jus suum cuique_.\r\n\r\n[211] It has been related with some picturesque detail, but with\r\nsubstantial accuracy, by Macaulay: and it is more completely treated in\r\nthe sixth volume of the publications of the Oxford Historical Society.\r\n\r\n[212] Oxf. Hist. Soc. _Collectanea_, II. (1890), pp. 147-8; see the\r\n_English Historical Review_, Apr. 1891.\r\n\r\n[213] In like manner the position of the head of the earliest College\r\n(Merton) was rather that of a Bursar than a Master, a _gardianus\r\nbonorum_ more than _scholarium_.\r\n\r\n[214] Wood’s _History of the University of Oxford_, ii. 755-7. The name\r\nof Brasenose occurs in the well-known forged charter which professes to\r\nbe of the date 1219.\r\n\r\n[215] Wood’s _History_, ii. 756.\r\n\r\n[216] See Peck’s _History of Stamford_, which contains an engraving\r\nof the gateway and knocker. The latter is perhaps more accurately\r\ndescribed as a door handle.\r\n\r\n[217] See the Proceedings of the Oxford Architectural and Historical\r\nSociety for November 18th, 1890. The site of the Hall with the gateway\r\nand knocker was purchased by Brasenose College in 1890, and the\r\neponymous Brazen Nose itself is now fixed in a place of honour in the\r\nCollege hall.\r\n\r\n[218] Until 1827 every candidate for a degree at Oxford took an oath\r\n“Tu jurabis, quod non leges nec audies [deliver or attend lectures]\r\nStanfordiæ, tanquam in Universitate, Studio vel Collegio generali.”\r\n\r\n[219] _Register of the Visitors_, ed. Burrows (Camd. Soc. N.S. xxix.),\r\n1881, p. cxxi.\r\n\r\n[220] _Life of Scott_, 1837, i. 374.\r\n\r\n[221] The printed editions run--\r\n\r\n    “No workman steel, no ponderous axes rung;\r\n    Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprung.”\r\n\r\n[222] _Odds and Ends_, 1872, p. 108: F. G. Lee’s _Glimpses of the\r\nSupernatural_, 1872, vol. ii. p. 207. The story there told of a sudden\r\ndeath at a club meeting, and a simultaneous appearance in Brasenose of\r\na fiend dragging a man out of the window through the bars, is probably\r\na mixture of two incidents, the death of a woman who had been given\r\nbrandy out of a Brasenose window on Dec. 5, 1827, and the death of the\r\nPresident of the H. F. Club in 1834, which closed the career of that\r\nsociety, between which and the Phœnix there was no connection whatever.\r\nThe story has now become a commonplace of fiction, to judge by the way\r\nin which it occurs dressed up in Maltese surroundings in _Blackwood’s\r\nMagazine_, Feb. 1891.\r\n\r\n[223] Printed incorrectly in _Blackwood’s Magazine_, vol. liv. (1843).\r\n\r\n[224] _The Eights._\r\n\r\nBrasenose has started head boat since 1837, when the Eights records\r\nbecome complete:--\r\n\r\n    *1839 (1 day)\r\n    *1840 (9)\r\n     1841 (4)\r\n    *1845 (6)\r\n    *1846 (8)\r\n     1847 (7)\r\n    *1852 (7)\r\n    *1853 (8)\r\n    *1854 (8)\r\n     1855 (7)\r\n    *1865 (2)\r\n    *1866 (7)\r\n    *1867 (8)\r\n     1868 (2)\r\n    *1876 (7)\r\n     1877 (2)\r\n    *1889 (5)\r\n    *1890 (6)\r\n    *1891 (6)\r\n\r\n    * In these years it left off Head of the River.\r\n\r\nIn all 110 days; the next highest number being 63 (University). The\r\nboat has never held a lower position than ninth. Of the earlier years\r\nbetween 1815 and 1836, B.N.C. left off head at least in 1815, 1822,\r\n1826, 1827.\r\n\r\n_The Torpids._\r\n\r\nBrasenose has started head boat since 1852, when the Torpids were first\r\nrowed in the Lent Term:--\r\n\r\n    *1852 (3 days)\r\n     1853 (5)\r\n     1854 (4)\r\n     1859 (2)\r\n    *1861 (5)\r\n    *1862 (6)\r\n     1863 (5)\r\n    *1866 (5)\r\n     1867 (2)\r\n    *1874 (2)\r\n    *1875 (6)\r\n     1876 (1)\r\n     1882 (2)\r\n     1883 (3)\r\n    *1886 (4)\r\n    *1887 (6)\r\n    *1888 (6)\r\n    *1889 (6)\r\n    *1890 (6)\r\n    *1891 (6)\r\n\r\n    * In these years it left off Head of the River.\r\n\r\nIn all 85 days; the next highest number being 59 (Exeter). The boat has\r\nnever fallen lower than the eighth place. Between 1839 and 1851, when\r\nthe Torpids were rowed after the Eights, B.N.C. left off head at least\r\nin 1842, 1845, 1850 and 1851.\r\n\r\n[225] In Parker’s _Handbook to Oxford_ is noticed the singularly\r\nbeautiful effect of the sun shining on summer evenings through both the\r\nwest and east windows, when viewed from Radcliffe Square.\r\n\r\n[226] The reputed founder of Little University Hall: it is believed\r\nthat the “King’s Hall” in the formal title of B.N.C. is a reference to\r\nAlfred; but he, Henry VIII., and Victoria may be regarded as equally\r\nclaiming the Royal Arms which face the High Street.\r\n\r\n[227] A Life of Foxe, prefixed to his episcopal register at Wells, by\r\nMr. Chisholm Batten, passed through the press simultaneously with my\r\narticle. The two lives are perfectly independent of one another, and\r\nneither had been seen by the author of the other, though Mr. Batten and\r\nI had interchanged information on certain points. I am glad to say that\r\nI believe there is no material fact in Foxe’s Life in regard to which\r\nwe differ.\r\n\r\n[228] See the chapter on Trinity College.\r\n\r\n[229] This word = “kissing,” alluding to the amatory propensities of\r\nsome of the monks of the time. It is often wrongly printed “buzzing.”\r\n\r\n[230] Thus, in speaking of the three readers of Theology, Greek, and\r\nLatin, he says:--“Decernimus igitur intra nostrum alvearium tres\r\nherbarios peritissimos in omne aevum constituere, qui stirpes, herbas,\r\ntum fructu tum usu praestantissimas, in eo plantent et conserant, ut\r\napes ingeniosae e toto gymnasio Oxoniensi convolantes ex eo exugere\r\natque excerpere poterunt.”\r\n\r\n[231] And yet there are, in the College Library, two copies of Horace,\r\nand one each of Homer, Herodotus, and Plato (see above), all given by\r\nthe Founder himself.\r\n\r\n[232] Ac caeteros, ut tempore, ita doctrina, longe posteriores.\r\n\r\n[233] “Ut intus operentur mellifici nec evocentur ad vilia, decernimus\r\nut sint quidam ab opere mellifico liberi et aliis obsequiis dediti.\r\nVerumtamen, si quispiam eorum mellifico voluerit imitari, duplicem\r\nmerebitur coronam”; Statut. cap. 17. In cap. 37 the lecturers are\r\nrequired to admit the “ministri Sacelli” and “famuli Collegii” to their\r\nlectures, without charge.\r\n\r\n[234] There can be no doubt that, at this period and subsequently,\r\nthe College servants were often matriculated and proceeded to their\r\ndegrees. And, as they were entered in the College books not by their\r\nnames but by their offices, this is one reason why it is often so\r\ndifficult to trace a student of those times to his College.\r\n\r\n[235] In the years 1649-52, there are several entries in the “Register\r\nof Punishments” to the effect that scholars or clerks are “put out of\r\ncommons” for refusing to wait in hall. At that time, therefore, there\r\nmust have been a feeling that the practice was irksome or degrading.\r\n\r\n[236] See the Statutes of Jesus College, Cambridge, chap. xx., where\r\nthey are limited to two in a day, and, on each occasion, to a pint of\r\nbeer and a piece of bread.\r\n\r\n[237] In a list of Greek Readers given by Fulman (Fulman MSS., Vol.\r\nX.), David Edwards is mentioned as preceding Wotton, but, possibly, he\r\nheld the appointment only temporarily, or there may be some confusion\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n[238] Both these dials have now disappeared. The large and very curious\r\ndial now in Corpus quadrangle was constructed by Charles Turnbull, a\r\nnative of Lincolnshire, in 1605.\r\n\r\n[239] In addition to the assistance he received from his College (as\r\nan academical clerk), from his uncle, and (in the earlier part of his\r\ncareer) from Bishop Jewel, who died in 1571, we find that Hooker, on no\r\nless than five occasions, was assisted out of the benefaction of Robert\r\nNowell, who had left to trustees a sum of money to be distributed\r\namongst poor scholars in Oxford. One of these entries is peculiarly\r\ntouching:--“To Richard hooker of Corpus christie college the xiith of\r\nfebruarye Anno 1571 to bringe him to Oxforde iis vid.” This date is\r\nprobably that of his return to Oxford after a visit to his parents\r\nat Exeter on recovering from a serious illness, the circumstances of\r\nwhich, including his affecting interview with Jewel at Salisbury,\r\nare so feelingly told in Walton’s Life. _The Spending of the Money\r\nof Robert Nowell_ (brother of Alexander Nowell, Dean of St. Paul’s),\r\nwhich contains some most curious and interesting entries, is one of the\r\nTowneley Hall MSS., and was edited, for private circulation only, by\r\nthe Rev. A. B. Grosart in 1877.\r\n\r\n[240] Wood’s _Annals_, _sub anno_ 1568.\r\n\r\n[241] The Visitors.\r\n\r\n[242] From a table in Burrows’ _Register of the Visitors_ (Camden\r\nSociety), pp. 494-6, it may be calculated that the proportion of those\r\nwho were expelled to those who remained was probably about four to one.\r\n\r\n[243] My attention was directed to the rare book, which contains this\r\naccount, by Mr. C. H. Firth of Balliol College. It is entitled _The\r\nPrivate Memoirs of John Potenger, Esq., edited by C. W. Bingham_, and\r\nwas published by Hamilton, Adams & Co. in 1841.\r\n\r\n[244] And yet, at the date of his admission, he was more than 16\r\nyears old. Even in the early part of the present century, there were\r\nmany admissions of scholars younger than Potenger. John Keble, when\r\nadmitted, was only 14 years 7 months old; his brother, Thomas Keble, 14\r\nyears 5 months; Thomas Arnold, 15 years 8 months; and R. G. Macmullen,\r\nwho was admitted in 1828, was actually under 14, his age being 13 years\r\n11 months. During the first thirty or forty years of this century, 15\r\nand 16 were not uncommon ages for the admission of scholars at Corpus;\r\nand, in addition to the cases cited above, there were occasional\r\ninstances of admission at 14. Even then, however, the age was most\r\nfrequently 17 or 18.\r\n\r\n[245] _Memoirs of R. L. Edgeworth, Esq._, in two vols., 1820.\r\nMy attention was kindly directed to this book by the Rev. R. G.\r\nLivingstone of Pembroke College.\r\n\r\n[246] That, in 1665, Monmouth resided in Corpus is distinctly stated by\r\nWood [MS. D. 19 (3)]: “Sept. 25, 1665, the king and duke of Monmouth\r\ncame from Salisbury to Oxon. … The king lodged himself in Xt Ch. … and\r\nthe duke of Monmouth and his dutchess at C. C. Coll.” They probably\r\ncontinued in Corpus till Jan. 27 following, when “the king with his\r\nretinue went from Oxon to Hampton.” I am indebted to the Rev. A. Clark\r\nfor this reference to Wood’s MS.\r\n\r\n[247] _Life of Archdeacon Phelps_, Hatchards, 1871.\r\n\r\n[248] The story of St. Frideswide and of the convent built in her\r\nhonour is very fully and quaintly told by Anthony à Wood. See Wood’s\r\n_City of Oxford_ (edit. Clark), vol. ii. p. 122.\r\n\r\n[249] See Boase, _Oxford_, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[250] See, however, the note at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[251] Boase, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[252] Sir Gilbert Scott is convinced that this is the original design,\r\nand no alteration. However, Dr. Ingram should be read (at p. 18 of his\r\n_Memorials of Oxford_), where he asserts a Norman superposition of the\r\nupper arches, and the Saxon construction of the lower shafts up to the\r\nhalf-capitals. His writings are founded on careful personal study of\r\nthe structure in his time.\r\n\r\n[253] The hall staircase, with its palm-shaped column (which is, in\r\nfact, more like a banyan-tree, as it is virtually a pendant from\r\nthe vaulted roof), is the principal architectural addition of the\r\nseventeenth century; and, with Wadham College, is its most beautiful\r\nwork in Oxford.\r\n\r\n[254] The lower portion only; the upper part, containing the great bell\r\n(“Great Tom”), is Wren’s.\r\n\r\n[255] Late in Elizabeth’s reign; confirmed by private Act of\r\nParliament, A.D. 1601.\r\n\r\n[256] The organ must have been placed between the nave and choir, in\r\nthe old order so well remembered and regretted by old Christ Church\r\nmen, who must still acknowledge the great improvement of these latter\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[257] John Cottisford, Rector of Lincoln College; not the Bishop of\r\nLincoln ordinary of the University, and executioner of Clark.\r\n\r\n[258] John London, Warden of New College; who, however, behaved with\r\nsense and kindness during the later proceedings of Wolsey’s persecution.\r\n\r\n[259] See Wood’s _City of Oxford_ (edit.

F. 31.\r\nIt may be noted that Jenkins’ good services to his College, and many\r\npersonal kindnesses to Wood himself, compel the Oxford antiquary for\r\nonce to give the lie to his reputation that he “never spake well of any\r\nman”; the terms in which he speaks of Sir Leoline are always handsome.\r\n\r\n[297] The plate “lent” by Jesus College to the King is stated by Bishop\r\nTanner to have weighed 86 lb. 11 oz. 5 dwt.\r\n\r\n[298] Wood’s (MS.) Diary, under that date.\r\n\r\n[299] Boase’s _Oxford_, p. 140.\r\n\r\n[300] Principal, 1712. His portrait is in the College Hall.\r\n\r\n[301] To this list may be added:--\r\n\r\n    Francis John Jayne, Chester (1889).\r\n\r\nSee also p. 383, note.\r\n\r\n[302] Afterwards Mayor, and knighted. Sir Sampson White’s house was\r\nopposite University College.\r\n\r\n[303] Michael Roberts.\r\n\r\n[304] This chair was made the pattern of the chairs in the Bursary.\r\n\r\n[305]\r\n\r\n    Alfred George Edwards, Bishop of St. Asaph, 1889.\r\n    Daniel Lewis Lloyd, Bishop of Bangor, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n[306] There is a trivial but well-known story that the College is to\r\npresent this piece of plate to whoever first fairly encircles it at\r\nits widest with his arms, but that from the shape and actual girth (5\r\nft. 2 in.) this feat has rarely been accomplished. A second task has,\r\nhowever, been kept in reserve; that the winner should drain it filled\r\nwith the strong punch for which it was designed, and then be able\r\nhimself to remove it; it holds ten gallons.\r\n\r\n[307] Wood quotes no authority, and his story of the founder’s\r\nintentions is inconsistent in one or two points with the curious\r\nold (though not contemporary) MS. account of the last wishes of the\r\nfounder, which is among the papers of Wadham College. Dorothy Wadham,\r\nhowever, was certainly a Recusant not long before her death (cf.\r\n_Calendar of State Papers_, 1619-1623, p. 330); it may perhaps be\r\nconjectured that the atrocity of the Gunpowder Plot alienated her\r\nhusband from his co-religionists, and induced him to conform to the\r\nNational Church.\r\n\r\n[308] A statute of 1268 directed that every B.A. should dispute against\r\nthe Austin Friars once a year in the interval between his taking that\r\ndegree and proceeding M.A. Although these disputations were removed to\r\nSt. Mary’s Church, and afterwards to the Natural Philosophy School,\r\nthey retained the name “Austin Disputations.” See Wood’s _City of\r\nOxford_ (edit. Clark), ii. p. 465. From _Oxoniana_ we learn that the\r\nname and some shadow of the disputations remained as late as 1812 among\r\nthe exercises for M.A.\r\n\r\n[309] Of this man an excellent account is given in the _Portfolio_ for\r\n1888. But there is some difficulty in attributing the buildings to\r\nHolt, for in the very full MSS. accounts for the buildings possessed\r\nby the College, his name only occurs as that of a working carpenter,\r\nreceiving ordinary wages. Perhaps the founder’s servant Arnold may have\r\nbeen the real architect.\r\n\r\n[310] Vol. 1611-1618, p. 217.\r\n\r\n[311] A full account of this controversy may be read on pp. 6-8 of the\r\nRev. R. B. Gardiner’s _Registers of Wadham College_, Oxford, to which\r\nmost valuable and interesting book I wish to acknowledge my constant\r\nobligations throughout this chapter. At present only the first volume\r\nis out (down to 1719); it is the earnest desire of all interested\r\nin the history of the College that Mr. Gardiner may soon be able to\r\ncomplete his work.\r\n\r\n[312] P. 53.\r\n\r\n[313] I. 291.\r\n\r\n[314] II. 106.\r\n\r\n[315] I. 318.\r\n\r\n[316] “A philosophical inquiry concerning Universal Grammar.” Johnson\r\ndisputes his title to be an “eminent Grecian.”\r\n\r\n[317] Fuller gives us a proverb current in Oxfordshire, “Send\r\nfarthingales to Broadgates Hall in Oxford,” adding that the gowns\r\nnot only of the gadding Dinahs but of most sober Sarahs of a former\r\nage were so penthoused out far beyond their bodies with bucklers of\r\npasteboard, that their wearers could not enter at any ordinary door,\r\nexcept sidelong.\r\n\r\n[318] Leonard Hutten’s _Antiquities of Oxford_ (1625), Oxf.

Society’s reprint,\r\n1887, p. 16.)\r\n\r\n[322] The patronage of this rectory, usually held by a Fellow, was\r\nalienated rather more than thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n[323] The slaughter-houses were replaced by a brew-house, to the use of\r\nwhich the old well beneath the wall was in 1672 diverted. Lumbard was\r\na Jew who lived here. It is odd that the only shop in this lane still\r\nexhibits the arms of Lombardy, and perhaps carries on the business of\r\nthis mediæval Jew: the Jewry was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[324] From a family named Penyverthing. A physician named Ireland who\r\nlived here in this century, and whose patients made believe to think\r\nhis fee was 1¼_d._, got the name changed to Pembroke Street.\r\n\r\n[325] Between 1675 and 1700 a new style of gardening seems to have come\r\ninto vogue. Compare Loggan and Burghersh.\r\n\r\n[326] Mrs. Evans, wife of the Rev. Dr. Evans, Master of the College.\r\n\r\n[327] This is the meaning of the entry “pro ostreis” in the Bursar’s\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n[328] The late Bishop Jeune told Mr. Burgon that aged persons in his\r\ntime remembered this.\r\n\r\n[329] “Johnson could not bear to be painted with his defects … ‘He\r\n[Reynolds] may paint himself as deaf as he pleases, but I will not be\r\n_Blinking Sam_’” (Piozzi).\r\n\r\n[330] It is curious that the College arms have almost from the first\r\nbeen blazoned wrongly, the argent and or fields of the chief having\r\nchanged places. The argent should be on the dexter side.\r\n\r\n[331] As it seems with a key; possibly a relic of the “wakening-mallet”\r\nof religious houses.\r\n\r\n[332] Contrast Gibbon’s spiteful words: “To the University of Oxford I\r\nacknowledge no obligations; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for\r\na son as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother.”\r\n\r\n[333] This Mr. Tristram is abused by Hearne.

Of the remaining\r\nScholarships four were founded by the Rev. John Meeke in 1665, three by\r\nMr. Henry Lusby (who divided his estate between this Hall and Emmanuel\r\nCollege, Cambridge) about 1832, and one in memory of Dr. Macbride,\r\nPrincipal 1813-1868.
