BEVAN\r\n\r\n  In grateful recollection of many kindnesses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Literary History of the Arabs_, published by T. Fisher Unwin in\r\n1907 and twice re-issued without alteration, now appears under new\r\nauspices, and I wish to thank the Syndics of the Cambridge University\r\nPress for the opportunity they have given me of making it in some\r\nrespects more accurate and useful than it has hitherto been. Since the\r\npresent edition is printed from the original plates, there could be no\r\nquestion of revising the book throughout and recasting it where\r\nnecessary; but while only a few pages have been rewritten, the\r\nBibliography has been brought up to date and I have removed several\r\nmistakes from the text and corrected others in an appendix which\r\nincludes a certain amount of supplementary matter. As stated in the\r\npreface to the first edition, I hoped \"to compile a work which should\r\nserve as a general introduction to the subject, and which should be\r\nneither too popular for students nor too scientific for ordinary\r\nreaders. It has been my chief aim to sketch in broad outlines what the\r\nArabs thought, and to indicate as far as possible the influences which\r\nmoulded their thought.... Experience has convinced me that young\r\nstudents of Arabic, to whom this volume is principally addressed,\r\noften find difficulty in understanding what they read, since they are\r\nnot in touch with the political, intellectual, and religious notions\r\nwhich are presented to them. The pages of almost every Arabic book\r\nabound in allusions to names, events, movements, and ideas of which\r\nMoslems require no explanation, but which puzzle the Western reader\r\nunless he have some general knowledge of Arabian history in the widest\r\nmeaning of the word. Such a survey is not to be found, I believe, in\r\nany single European book; and if mine supply the want, however\r\npartially and inadequately, I shall feel that my labour has been amply\r\nrewarded.... As regards the choice of topics, I agree with the author\r\nof a famous anthology who declares that it is harder to select than\r\ncompose (_ikhtiyáru ’l-kalám aṣ‘abu min ta’lífihi_). Perhaps an\r\nepitomist may be excused for not doing equal justice all round. To me\r\nthe literary side of the subject appeals more than the historical, and\r\nI have followed my bent without hesitation; for in order to interest\r\nothers a writer must first be interested himself.... Considering the\r\nimportance of Arabic poetry as, in the main, a true mirror of Arabian\r\nlife, I do not think the space devoted to it is excessive. Other\r\nbranches of literature could not receive the same attention. Many an\r\neminent writer has been dismissed in a few lines, many well-known\r\nnames have been passed over. But, as before said, this work is a\r\nsketch of ideas in their historical environment rather than a record\r\nof authors, books, and dates. The exact transliteration of Arabic\r\nwords, though superfluous for scholars and for persons entirely\r\nignorant of the language, is an almost indispensable aid to the class\r\nof readers whom I have especially in view. My system is that\r\nrecommended by the Royal Asiatic Society and adopted by Professor\r\nBrowne in his _Literary History of Persia_; but I use ẓ for the letter\r\nwhich he denotes by _dh_. The definite article _al_, which is\r\nfrequently omitted at the beginning of proper names, has been restored\r\nin the Index. It may save trouble if I mention here the abbreviations\r\n'b.' for 'ibn' (son of); J.R.A.S. for _Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety_; Z.D.M.G. for _Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen\r\nGesellschaft_; and S.B.W.A. for _Sitzungsberichte der Wiener\r\nAkademie_. Finally, it behoves me to make full acknowledgment of my\r\ndebt to the learned Orientalists whose works I have studied and freely\r\n'conveyed' into these pages. References could not be given in every\r\ncase, but the reader will see for himself how much is derived from Von\r\nKremer, Goldziher, Nöldeke, and Wellhausen, to mention only a few of\r\nthe leading authorities. At the same time I have constantly gone back\r\nto the native sources of information.\"\r\n\r\nThere remains an acknowledgment of a more personal kind. Twenty-two\r\nyears ago I wrote--\"my warmest thanks are due to my friend and\r\ncolleague, Professor A. A. Bevan, who read the proofs throughout and\r\nmade a number of valuable remarks which will be found in the footnotes.\"\r\nHappily the present occasion permits me to renew those ties between us;\r\nand the book which he helped into the world now celebrates its majority\r\nby associating itself with his name.\r\n\r\n  REYNOLD A.

This term includes the Babylonians and Assyrians, the\r\nHebrews, the Phœnicians, the Aramæans, the Abyssinians, the Sabæans, and\r\nthe Arabs, and although based on a classification that is not\r\nethnologically precise--the Phœnicians and Sabæans, for example, being\r\nreckoned in Genesis, chap. x, among the descendants of Ham--it was well\r\nchosen by Eichhorn († 1827) to comprehend the closely allied peoples\r\nwhich have been named. Whether the original home of the undivided\r\nSemitic race was some part of Asia (Arabia, Armenia, or the district of\r\nthe Lower Euphrates), or whether, according to a view which has lately\r\nfound favour, the Semites crossed into Asia from Africa,[1] is still\r\nuncertain. Long before the epoch when they first appear in history they\r\nhad branched off from the parent stock and formed separate\r\nnationalities. The relation of the Semitic languages to each other\r\ncannot be discussed here, but we may arrange them in the chronological\r\norder of the extant literature as follows:--[2]\r\n\r\n  1. Babylonian or Assyrian (3000-500 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  2. Hebrew (from 1500 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  3. South Arabic, otherwise called Sabæan or Ḥimyarite (inscriptions\r\n       from 800 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  4. Aramaic (inscriptions from 800 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  5. Phœnician (inscriptions from 700 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  6. Æthiopic (inscriptions from 350 A.D.).\r\n\r\n  7. Arabic (from 500 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Arabs as representatives of the Semitic Race.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Arabic is thus, in a sense, the youngest of the\r\nSemitic languages, it is generally allowed to be nearer akin than any of\r\nthem to the original archetype, the 'Ursemitisch,' from which they all\r\nare derived, just as the Arabs, by reason of their geographical\r\nsituation and the monotonous uniformity of desert life, have in some\r\nrespects preserved the Semitic character more purely and exhibited it\r\nmore distinctly than any people of the same family. From the period of\r\nthe great Moslem conquests (700 A.D.) to the present day they have\r\nextended their language, religion, and culture over an enormous expanse\r\nof territory, far surpassing that of all the ancient Semitic empires\r\nadded together. It is true that the Arabs are no longer what they were\r\nin the Middle Ages, the ruling nation of the world, but loss of temporal\r\npower has only strengthened their spiritual dominion. Islam still reigns\r\nsupreme in Western Asia; in Africa it has steadily advanced; even on\r\nEuropean soil it has found in Turkey compensation for its banishment\r\nfrom Spain and Sicily. While most of the Semitic peoples have vanished,\r\nleaving but a meagre and ambiguous record, so that we cannot hope to\r\nbecome intimately acquainted with them, we possess in the case of the\r\nArabs ample materials for studying almost every phase of their\r\ndevelopment since the sixth century of the Christian era, and for\r\nwriting the whole history of their national life and thought. This book,\r\nI need hardly say, makes no such pretensions. Even were the space at my\r\ndisposal unlimited, a long time must elapse before the vast and various\r\nfield of Arabic literature can be thoroughly explored and the results\r\nrendered accessible to the historian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabs of the North and South.]\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial Arabia was divided into North and South, not only\r\nby the trackless desert (_al-Rub‘ al-Khálí_, the 'Solitary Quarter')\r\nwhich stretches across the peninsula and forms a natural barrier to\r\nintercourse, but also by the opposition of two kindred races widely\r\ndiffering in their character and way of life. Whilst the inhabitants of\r\nthe northern province (the Ḥijáz and the great central highland of Najd)\r\nwere rude nomads sheltering in 'houses of hair,' and ever shifting to\r\nand fro in search of pasture for their camels, the people of Yemen or\r\nArabia Felix are first mentioned in history as the inheritors of an\r\nancient civilisation and as the owners of fabulous wealth--spices, gold\r\nand precious stones--which ministered to the luxury of King Solomon. The\r\nBedouins of the North spoke Arabic--that is to say, the language of the\r\nPre-islamic poems and of the Koran--whereas the southerners used a\r\ndialect called by Muḥammadans 'Ḥimyarite' and a peculiar script of which\r\nthe examples known to us have been discovered and deciphered in\r\ncomparatively recent times. Of these Sabæans--to adopt the designation\r\ngiven to them by Greek and Roman geographers--more will be said\r\npresently. The period of their bloom was drawing to a close in the early\r\ncenturies of our era, and they have faded out of history before 600\r\nA.D., when their northern neighbours first rise into prominence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ishmaelites and Yoqṭánids.]\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt, the consciousness of this racial distinction that\r\ncaused the view to prevail among Moslem genealogists that the Arabs\r\nfollowed two separate lines of descent from their common ancestor, Sám\r\nb. Núḥ (Shem, the son of Noah). As regards those of the North, their\r\nderivation from ‘Adnán, a descendant of Ismá‘íl (Ishmael) was\r\nuniversally recognised; those of the South were traced back to Qaḥṭán,\r\nwhom most genealogists identified with Yoqṭán (Joktan), the son of ‘Ábir\r\n(Eber). Under the Yoqṭánids, who are the elder line, we find, together\r\nwith the Sabæans and Ḥimyarites, several large and powerful\r\ntribes--_e.g._, Ṭayyi’, Kinda, and Tanúkh--which had settled in North\r\nand Central Arabia long before Islam, and were in no respect\r\ndistinguishable from the Bedouins of Ishmaelite origin. As to ‘Adnán,\r\nhis exact genealogy is disputed, but all agree that he was of the\r\nposterity of Ismá‘íl (Ishmael), the son of Ibráhím (Abraham) by Hájar\r\n(Hagar). The story runs that on the birth of Ismá‘íl God commanded\r\nAbraham to journey to Mecca with Hagar and her son and to leave them\r\nthere. They were seen by some Jurhumites, descendants of Yoqṭán, who\r\ntook pity on them and resolved to settle beside them. Ismá‘íl grew up\r\nwith the sons of the strangers, learned to shoot the bow, and spoke\r\ntheir tongue. Then he asked of them in marriage, and they married him to\r\none of their women.[3] The tables on the opposite page show the\r\nprincipal branches of the younger but by far the more important family\r\nof the Arabs which traced its pedigree through ‘Adnán to Ismá‘íl. A\r\ndotted line indicates the omission of one or more links in the\r\ngenealogical chain.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              I.[5]\r\n\r\n                  THE DESCENDENTS OF RABI‘A.\r\n\r\n                           ‘Adnán.\r\n                              │\r\n                           Ma‘add.\r\n                              │\r\n                            Nizár.\r\n                              │\r\n                           Rabi‘a.\r\n                              │\r\n     -------------------------------------------------------\r\n      │                       │                        │\r\n   ‘Anaza.                    │                        │\r\n                            Wá’il.

Fihr (Quraysh).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Muḥammadan genealogy.]\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that these lineages are to some extent fictitious.\r\nThere was no Pre-islamic science of genealogy, so that the first\r\nMuḥammadan investigators had only confused and scanty traditions to work\r\non. They were biassed, moreover, by political, religious, and other\r\nconsiderations.[6] Thus their study of the Koran and of Biblical history\r\nled to the introduction of the patriarchs who stand at the head of their\r\nlists. Nor can we accept the national genealogy beginning with ‘Adnán as\r\nentirely historical, though a great deal of it was actually stored in\r\nthe memories of the Arabs at the time when Islam arose, and is\r\ncorroborated by the testimony of the Pre-islamic poets.[7] On the other\r\nhand, the alleged descent of every tribe from an eponymous ancestor is\r\ninconsistent with facts established by modern research.[8] It is\r\nprobable that many names represent merely a local or accidental union;\r\nand many more, _e.g._, Ma‘add, seem originally to have denoted large\r\ngroups or confederations of tribes. The theory of a radical difference\r\nbetween the Northern Arabs and those of the South, corresponding to the\r\nfierce hostility which has always divided them since the earliest days\r\nof Islam,[9] may hold good if we restrict the term 'Yemenite' (Southern)\r\nto the civilised Sabæans, Ḥimyarites, &c., who dwelt in Yemen and spoke\r\ntheir own dialect, but can hardly apply to the Arabic-speaking\r\n'Yemenite' Bedouins scattered all over the peninsula. Such criticism,\r\nhowever, does not affect the value of the genealogical documents\r\nregarded as an index of the popular mind. From this point of view legend\r\nis often superior to fact, and it must be our aim in the following\r\nchapters to set forth what the Arabs believed rather than to examine\r\nwhether or no they were justified in believing it.\r\n\r\n'Arabic,' in its widest signification, has two principal dialects:--\r\n\r\n1. South Arabic, spoken in Yemen and including Sabæan, Ḥimyarite,\r\nMinæan, with the kindred dialects of Mahra and Shiḥr.\r\n\r\n2. Arabic proper, spoken in Arabia generally, exclusive of Yemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South Arabic.]\r\n\r\nOf the former language, leaving Mahrí, Socotrí, and other living\r\ndialects out of account, we possess nothing beyond the numerous\r\ninscriptions which have been collected by European travellers and which\r\nit will be convenient to discuss in the next chapter, where I shall give\r\na brief sketch of the legendary history of the Sabæans and Ḥimyarites.\r\nSouth Arabic resembles Arabic in its grammatical forms, _e.g._, the\r\nbroken plural, the sign of the dual, and the manner of denoting\r\nindefiniteness by an affixed _m_ (for which Arabic substitutes _n_) as\r\nwell as in its vocabulary; its alphabet, which consists of twenty-nine\r\nletters, _Sin_ and _Samech_ being distinguished as in Hebrew, is more\r\nnearly akin to the Æthiopic. The Ḥimyarite Empire was overthrown by the\r\nAbyssinians in the sixth century after Christ, and by 600 A.D. South\r\nArabic had become a dead language. From this time forward the dialect of\r\nthe North established an almost universal supremacy and won for itself\r\nthe title of 'Arabic' _par excellence_.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The oldest specimens of Arabic writing.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pre-islamic poems.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Koran.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabic in the Muḥammadan Empire.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest monuments of written Arabic are modern in date compared with\r\nthe Sabæan inscriptions, some of which take us back 2,500 years or\r\nthereabout. Apart from the inscriptions of Ḥijr in the northern Ḥijáz,\r\nand those of Ṣafá in the neighbourhood of Damascus (which, although\r\nwritten by northern Arabs before the Christian era, exhibit a peculiar\r\ncharacter not unlike the Sabæan and cannot be called Arabic in the usual\r\nacceptation of the term), the most ancient examples of Arabic writing\r\nwhich have hitherto been discovered appear in the trilingual (Syriac,\r\nGreek, and Arabic) inscription of Zabad,[11] south-east of Aleppo, dated\r\n512 or 513 A.D., and the bilingual (Greek and Arabic) of Ḥarrán,[12]\r\ndated 568 A.D. With these documents we need not concern ourselves\r\nfurther, especially as their interpretation presents great difficulties.\r\nVery few among the Pre-islamic Arabs were able to read or write.[13]\r\nThose who could generally owed their skill to Jewish and Christian\r\nteachers, or to the influence of foreign culture radiating from Ḥíra and\r\nGhassán. But although the Koran, which was first collected soon after\r\nthe battle of Yamáma (633 A.D.), is the oldest Arabic book, the\r\nbeginnings of literary composition in the Arabic language can be traced\r\nback to an earlier period. Probably all the Pre-islamic poems which have\r\ncome down to us belong to the century preceding Islam (500-622 A.D.),\r\nbut their elaborate form and technical perfection forbid the hypothesis\r\nthat in them we have \"the first sprightly runnings\" of Arabian song. It\r\nmay be said of these magnificent odes, as of the Iliad and Odyssey, that\r\n\"they are works of highly finished art, which could not possibly have\r\nbeen produced until the poetical art had been practised for a long\r\ntime.\" They were preserved during hundreds of years by oral tradition,\r\nas we shall explain elsewhere, and were committed to writing, for the\r\nmost part, by the Moslem scholars of the early ‘Abbásid age, _i.e._,\r\nbetween 750 and 900 A.D. It is a noteworthy fact that the language of\r\nthese poems, the authors of which represent many different tribes and\r\ndistricts of the peninsula, is one and the same. The dialectical\r\nvariations are too trivial to be taken into account. We might conclude\r\nthat the poets used an artificial dialect, not such as was commonly\r\nspoken but resembling the epic dialect of Ionia which was borrowed by\r\nDorian and Æolian bards. When we find, however, that the language in\r\nquestion is employed not only by the wandering troubadours, who were\r\noften men of some culture, and the Christian Arabs of Ḥíra on the\r\nEuphrates, but also by goat-herds, brigands, and illiterate Bedouins of\r\nevery description, there can be no room for doubt that in the poetry of\r\nthe sixth century we hear the Arabic language as it was then spoken\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of Arabia. The success of Muḥammad and\r\nthe conquests made by Islam under the Orthodox Caliphs gave an entirely\r\nnew importance to this classical idiom. Arabic became the sacred\r\nlanguage of the whole Moslem world. This was certainly due to the Koran;\r\nbut, on the other hand, to regard the dialect of Mecca, in which the\r\nKoran is written, as the source and prototype of the Arabic language,\r\nand to call Arabic 'the dialect of Quraysh,' is utterly to reverse the\r\ntrue facts of the case. Muḥammad, as Nöldeke has observed, took the\r\nancient poetry for a model; and in the early age of Islam it was the\r\nauthority of the heathen poets (of whom Quraysh had singularly few) that\r\ndetermined the classical usage and set the standard of correct speech.\r\nMoslems, who held the Koran to be the Word of God and inimitable in\r\npoint of style, naturally exalted the dialect of the Prophet's tribe\r\nabove all others, even laying down the rule that every tribe spoke less\r\npurely in proportion to its distance from Mecca, but this view will not\r\ncommend itself to the unprejudiced student. The Koran, however,\r\nexercised a unique influence on the history of the Arabic language and\r\nliterature. We shall see in a subsequent chapter that the necessity of\r\npreserving the text of the Holy Book uncorrupted, and of elucidating its\r\nobscurities, caused the Moslems to invent a science of grammar and\r\nlexicography, and to collect the old Pre-Muḥammadan poetry and\r\ntraditions which must otherwise have perished. When the Arabs settled as\r\nconquerors in Syria and Persia and mixed with foreign peoples, the\r\npurity of the classical language could no longer be maintained. While in\r\nArabia itself, especially among the nomads of the desert, little\r\ndifference was felt, in the provincial garrison towns and great centres\r\nof industry like Baṣra and Kúfa, where the population largely consisted\r\nof aliens who had embraced Islam and were rapidly being Arabicised, the\r\ndoor stood open for all sorts of depravation to creep in. Against this\r\nvulgar Arabic the philologists waged unrelenting war, and it was mainly\r\nthrough their exertions that the classical idiom triumphed over the\r\ndangers to which it was exposed. Although the language of the pagan\r\nBedouins did not survive intact--or survived, at any rate, only in the\r\nmouths of pedants and poets--it became, in a modified form, the\r\nuniversal medium of expression among the upper classes of Muḥammadan\r\nsociety. During the early Middle Ages it was spoken and written by all\r\ncultivated Moslems, of whatever nationality they might be, from the\r\nIndus to the Atlantic; it was the language of the Court and the Church,\r\nof Law and Commerce, of Diplomacy and Literature and Science. When the\r\nMongol invasion in the thirteenth century swept away the ‘Abbásid\r\nCaliphate, and therewith the last vestige of political unity in Islam,\r\nclassical Arabic ceased to be the κοινή or 'common dialect' of\r\nthe Moslem world, and was supplanted in Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and other\r\nArabic-speaking countries by a vulgar colloquial idiom. In these\r\ncountries, however, it is still the language of business, literature,\r\nand education, and we are told on high authority that even now it \"is\r\nundergoing a renaissance, and there is every likelihood of its again\r\nbecoming a great literary vehicle.\"[14] And if, for those Moslems who\r\nare not Arabs, it occupies relatively much the same position as Latin\r\nand Greek in modern European culture, we must not forget that the Koran,\r\nits most renowned masterpiece, is learned by every Moslem when he first\r\ngoes to school, is repeated in his daily prayers, and influences the\r\nwhole course of his life to an extent which the ordinary Christian can\r\nhardly realise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nabaṭæans.]\r\n\r\nI hope that I may be excused for ignoring in a work such as this the\r\ninformation regarding Ancient Arabian history which it is possible to\r\nglean from the Babylonian and Assyrian monuments. Any sketch that might\r\nbe drawn of the Arabs, say from 2500 B.C. to the beginning of our era,\r\nwould resemble a map of Cathay delineated by Sir John Mandeville. But\r\namongst the shadowy peoples of the peninsula one, besides Saba and\r\nḤimyar, makes something more than a transient impression. The Nabaṭæans\r\n(_Nabaṭ_, pl. _Anbáṭ_) dwelt in towns, drove a flourishing trade long\r\nbefore the birth of Christ, and founded the kingdom of Petra, which\r\nattained a high degree of prosperity and culture until it was annexed by\r\nTrajan in 105 A.D. These Nabaṭæans were Arabs and spoke Arabic, although\r\nin default of a script of their own they used Aramaic for writing.[15]\r\nMuḥammadan authors identify them with the Aramæans, but careful study of\r\ntheir inscriptions has shown that this view, which was accepted by\r\nQuatremère,[16] is erroneous. 'The Book of Nabaṭæan Agriculture'\r\n(_Kitábu ’l-Faláḥat al-Nabaṭiyya_), composed in 904 A.D. by the Moslem\r\nIbnu ’l-Waḥshiyya, who professed to have translated it from the\r\nChaldæan, is now known to be a forgery. I only mention it here as an\r\ninstance of the way in which Moslems apply the term 'Nabaṭæan'; for the\r\ntitle in question does not, of course, refer to Petra but to Babylon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three periods of Arabian history.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said the reader will perceive that the history of the\r\nArabs, so far as our knowledge of it is derived from Arabic sources, may\r\nbe divided into the following periods:--\r\n\r\n    I. The Sabæan and Ḥimyarite period, from 800 B.C.,\r\n         the date of the oldest South Arabic inscriptions, to\r\n         500 A.D.\r\n\r\n   II. The Pre-islamic period (500-622 A.D.).\r\n\r\n  III. The Muḥammadan period, beginning with the Migration\r\n         (Hijra, or Hegira, as the word is generally written)\r\n          of the Prophet from Mecca to Medína in 622 A.D.\r\n          and extending to the present day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sabæans and Ḥimyarites.]\r\n\r\nFor the first period, which is confined to the history of Yemen or South\r\nArabia, we have no contemporary Arabic sources except the inscriptions.\r\nThe valuable but imperfect information which these supply is appreciably\r\nincreased by the traditions preserved in the Pre-islamic poems, in the\r\nKoran, and particularly in the later Muḥammadan literature. It is true\r\nthat most of this material is legendary and would justly be ignored by\r\nany one engaged in historical research, but I shall nevertheless devote\r\na good deal of space to it, since my principal object is to make known\r\nthe beliefs and opinions of the Arabs themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pagan Arabs.]\r\n\r\nThe second period is called by Muḥammadan writers the _Jáhiliyya_,\r\n_i.e._, the Age of Ignorance or Barbarism.[17] Its characteristics are\r\nfaithfully and vividly reflected in the songs and odes of the heathen\r\npoets which have come down to us. There was no prose literature at that\r\ntime: it was the poet's privilege to sing the history of his own people,\r\nto record their genealogies, to celebrate their feats of arms, and to\r\nextol their virtues. Although an immense quantity of Pre-islamic verse\r\nhas been lost for ever, we still possess a considerable remnant, which,\r\ntogether with the prose narratives compiled by Moslem philologists and\r\nantiquaries, enables us to picture the life of those wild days, in its\r\nlarger aspects, accurately enough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moslem Arabs.]\r\n\r\nThe last and by far the most important of the three periods comprises\r\nthe history of the Arabs under Islam. It falls naturally into the\r\nfollowing sections, which are enumerated in this place in order that the\r\nreader may see at a glance the broad political outlines of the complex\r\nand difficult epoch which lies before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ The Life of Muḥammad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life of Muḥammad.]\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the seventh century of the Christian era a man\r\nnamed Muḥammad, son of ‘Abdulláh, of the tribe Quraysh, appeared in\r\nMecca with a Divine revelation (Koran). He called on his fellow-townsmen\r\nto renounce idolatry and worship the One God. In spite of ridicule and\r\npersecution he continued for several years to preach the religion of\r\nIslam in Mecca, but, making little progress there, he fled in 622 A.D.\r\nto the neighbouring city of Medína. From this date his cause prospered\r\nexceedingly. During the next decade the whole of Arabia submitted to his\r\nrule and did lip-service at least to the new Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B._ The Orthodox Caliphate (632-661 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Orthodox Caliphs.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Prophet the Moslems were governed in turn by four of\r\nthe most eminent among his Companions--Abú Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmán, and\r\n‘Alí--who bore the title of _Khalífa_ (Caliph), _i.e._, Vicegerent, and\r\nare commonly described as the Orthodox Caliphs (_al-Khulafá\r\nal-Ráshidún_). Under their guidance Islam was firmly established in the\r\npeninsula and was spread far beyond its borders. Hosts of Bedouins\r\nsettled as military colonists in the fertile plains of Syria and Persia.\r\nSoon, however, the recently founded empire was plunged into civil war.\r\nThe murder of ‘Uthmán gave the signal for a bloody strife between rival\r\nclaimants of the Caliphate. ‘Alí, the son-in-law of the Prophet, assumed\r\nthe title, but his election was contested by the powerful governor of\r\nSyria, Mu‘áwiya b. Abí Sufyán.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C._ The Umayyad Dynasty (661-750 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Umayyad dynasty.]\r\n\r\n‘Alí fell by an assassin's dagger, and Mu‘áwiya succeeded to the\r\nCaliphate, which remained in his family for ninety years. The Umayyads,\r\nwith a single exception, were Arabs first and Moslems afterwards.\r\nReligion sat very lightly on them, but they produced some able and\r\nenergetic princes, worthy leaders of an imperial race. By 732 A.D. the\r\nMoslem conquests had reached the utmost limit which they ever attained.\r\nThe Caliph in Damascus had his lieutenants beyond the Oxus and the\r\nPyrenees, on the shores of the Caspian and in the valley of the Nile.\r\nMeantime the strength of the dynasty was being sapped by political and\r\nreligious dissensions nearer home. The Shí‘ites, who held that the\r\nCaliphate belonged by Divine right to ‘Alí and his descendants, rose in\r\nrevolt again and again. They were joined by the Persian Moslems, who\r\nloathed the Arabs and the oppressive Umayyad government. The ‘Abbásids,\r\na family closely related to the Prophet, put themselves at the head of\r\nthe agitation. It ended in the complete overthrow of the reigning house,\r\nwhich was almost exterminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_D._ The ‘Abbásid Dynasty (750-1258 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Abbásid dynasty.]\r\n\r\nHitherto the Arabs had played a dominant rôle in the Moslem community,\r\nand had treated the non-Arab Moslems with exasperating contempt. Now the\r\ntables were turned. We pass from the period of Arabian nationalism to\r\none of Persian ascendancy and cosmopolitan culture. The flower of the\r\n‘Abbásid troops were Persians from Khurásán; Baghdád, the wonderful\r\n‘Abbásid capital, was built on Persian soil; and Persian nobles filled\r\nthe highest offices of state at the ‘Abbásid court. The new dynasty, if\r\nnot religious, was at least favourable to religion, and took care to\r\nlive in the odour of sanctity. For a time Arabs and Persians forgot\r\ntheir differences and worked together as good Moslems ought. Piety was\r\nno longer its own reward. Learning enjoyed munificent patronage. This\r\nwas the Golden Age of Islam, which culminated in the glorious reign of\r\nHárún al-Rashíd (786-809 A.D.). On his death peace was broken once more,\r\nand the mighty empire began slowly to collapse. As province after\r\nprovince cut itself loose from the Caliphate, numerous independent\r\ndynasties sprang up, while the Caliphs became helpless puppets in the\r\nhands of Turkish mercenaries. Their authority was still formally\r\nrecognised in most Muḥammadan countries, but since the middle of the\r\nninth century they had little or no real power.\r\n\r\n\r\n_E._ From the Mongol invasion to the present day (1258 A.D.--).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Post-Mongolian period.]\r\n\r\nThe Mongol hordes under Húlágú captured Baghdád in 1258 A.D. and made an\r\nend of the Caliphate. Sweeping onward, they were checked by the Egyptian\r\nMamelukes and retired into Persia, where, some fifty years afterwards,\r\nthey embraced Islam. The successors of Húlágú, the Íl-kháns, reigned in\r\nPersia until a second wave of barbarians under Tímúr spread devastation\r\nand anarchy through Western Asia (1380-1405 A.D.). The unity of Islam,\r\nin a political sense, was now destroyed. Out of the chaos three\r\nMuḥammadan empires gradually took shape. In 1358 the Ottoman Turks\r\ncrossed the Hellespont, in 1453 they entered Constantinople, and in 1517\r\nSyria, Egypt, and Arabia were added to their dominions. Persia became an\r\nindependent kingdom under the Ṣafawids (1502-1736); while in India\r\nthe empire of the Great Moguls was founded by Bábur, a descendant of\r\nTímúr, and gloriously maintained by his successors, Akbar and Awrangzíb\r\n(1525-1707).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabian literary history.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Writers who are wholly or partly of foreign extraction.]\r\n\r\nSome of the political events which have been summarised above will be\r\ntreated more fully in the body of this work; others will receive no more\r\nthan a passing notice. The ideas which reveal themselves in Arabic\r\nliterature are so intimately connected with the history of the people,\r\nand so incomprehensible apart from the external circumstances in which\r\nthey arose, that I have found myself obliged to dwell at considerable\r\nlength on various matters of historical interest, in order to bring out\r\nwhat is really characteristic and important from our special point of\r\nview. The space devoted to the early periods (500-750 A.D.) will not\r\nappear excessive if they are seen in their true light as the centre and\r\nheart of Arabian history. During the next hundred years Moslem\r\ncivilisation reaches its zenith, but the Arabs recede more and more into\r\nthe background. The Mongol invasion virtually obliterated their national\r\nlife, though in Syria and Egypt they maintained their traditions of\r\nculture under Turkish rule, and in Spain we meet them struggling\r\ndesperately against Christendom. Many centuries earlier, in the balmy\r\ndays of the ‘Abbásid Empire, the Arabs _pur sang_ contributed only a\r\ncomparatively small share to the literature which bears their name. I\r\nhave not, however, enforced the test of nationality so strictly as to\r\nexclude all foreigners or men of mixed origin who wrote in Arabic. It\r\nmay be said that the work of Persians (who even nowadays are accustomed\r\nto use Arabic when writing on theological and philosophical subjects)\r\ncannot illustrate the history of Arabian thought, but only the influence\r\nexerted upon Arabian thought by Persian ideas, and that consequently it\r\nmust stand aside unless admitted for this definite purpose. But what\r\nshall we do in the case of those numerous and celebrated authors who are\r\nneither wholly Arab nor wholly Persian, but unite the blood of both\r\nraces? Must we scrutinise their genealogies and try to discover which\r\nstrain preponderates? That would be a tedious and unprofitable task. The\r\ntruth is that after the Umayyad period no hard-and-fast line can be\r\ndrawn between the native and foreign elements in Arabic literature. Each\r\nreacted on the other, and often both are combined indissolubly. Although\r\nthey must be distinguished as far as possible, we should be taking a\r\nnarrow and pedantic view of literary history if we insisted on regarding\r\nthem as mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSABA AND ḤIMYAR\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Primitive races.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legend of ‘Ad.]\r\n\r\nWith the Sabæans Arabian history in the proper sense may be said to\r\nbegin, but as a preliminary step we must take account of certain races\r\nwhich figure more or less prominently in legend, and are considered by\r\nMoslem chroniclers to have been the original inhabitants of the country.\r\nAmong these are the peoples of ‘Ád and Thamúd, which are constantly held\r\nup in the Koran as terrible examples of the pride that goeth before\r\ndestruction. The home of the ‘Ádites was in Ḥaḍramawt, the province\r\nadjoining Yemen, on the borders of the desert named _Aḥqáfu ’l-Raml_. It\r\nis doubtful whether they were Semites, possibly of Aramaic descent, who\r\nwere subdued and exterminated by invaders from the north, or, as Hommel\r\nmaintains,[18] the representatives of an imposing non-Semitic culture\r\nwhich survives in the tradition of 'Many-columned Iram,'[19] the Earthly\r\nParadise built by Shaddád, one of their kings. The story of their\r\ndestruction is related as follows:[20] They were a people of gigantic\r\nstrength and stature, worshipping idols and committing all manner of\r\nwrong; and when God sent to them a prophet, Húd by name, who should warn\r\nthem to repent, they answered: \"O Húd, thou hast brought us no evidence,\r\nand we will not abandon our gods for thy saying, nor will we believe in\r\nthee. We say one of our gods hath afflicted thee with madness.\"[21] Then\r\na fearful drought fell upon the land of ‘Ád, so that they sent a number\r\nof their chief men to Mecca to pray for rain. On arriving at Mecca the\r\nenvoys were hospitably received by the Amalekite prince, Mu‘áwiya b.\r\nBakr, who entertained them with wine and music--for he had two famous\r\nsinging-girls known as _al-Jarádatán_; which induced them to neglect\r\ntheir mission for the space of a whole month. At last, however, they got\r\nto business, and their spokesman had scarce finished his prayer when\r\nthree clouds appeared, of different colours--white, red, and black--and\r\na voice cried from heaven, \"Choose for thyself and for thy people!\" He\r\nchose the black cloud, deeming that it had the greatest store of rain,\r\nwhereupon the voice chanted--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou hast chosen embers dun | that will spare of ‘Ád not one | that\r\n  will leave nor father nor son | ere him to death they shall have\r\n  done.\"\r\n\r\nThen God drove the cloud until it stood over the land of ‘Ád, and there\r\nissued from it a roaring wind that consumed the whole people except a\r\nfew who had taken the prophet's warning to heart and had renounced\r\nidolatry.\r\n\r\nFrom these, in course of time, a new people arose, who are called 'the\r\nsecond ‘Ád.' They had their settlements in Yemen, in the region of Saba.\r\nThe building of the great Dyke of Ma’rib is commonly attributed to their\r\nking, Luqmán b. ‘Ád, about whom many fables are told. He was surnamed\r\n'The Man of the Vultures' (_Dhu ’l-Nusúr_), because it had been granted\r\nto him that he should live as long as seven vultures, one after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legend of Thamúd.]\r\n\r\nIn North Arabia, between the Ḥijáz and Syria, dwelt the kindred race of\r\nThamúd, described in the Koran (vii, 72) as inhabiting houses which they\r\ncut for themselves in the rocks. Evidently Muḥammad did not know the\r\ntrue nature of the hewn chambers which are still to be seen at Ḥijr\r\n(Madá’in Ṣáliḥ), a week's journey northward from Medína, and which are\r\nproved by the Nabaṭæan inscriptions engraved on them to have been\r\nsepulchral monuments.[22] Thamúd sinned in the same way as ‘Ád, and\r\nsuffered a like fate. They scouted the prophet Ṣáliḥ, refusing to\r\nbelieve in him unless he should work a miracle. Ṣáliḥ then caused a\r\nshe-camel big with young to come forth from a rock, and bade them do her\r\nno hurt, but one of the miscreants, Qudár the Red (al-Aḥmar), hamstrung\r\nand killed her. \"Whereupon a great earthquake overtook them with a noise\r\nof thunder, and in the morning they lay dead in their houses, flat upon\r\ntheir breasts.\"[23] The author of this catastrophe became a byword:\r\nArabs say, \"More unlucky than the hamstringer of the she-camel,\" or\r\n\"than Aḥmar of Thamúd.\" It should be pointed out that, unlike the\r\n‘Ádites, of whom we find no trace in historical times, the Thamúdites\r\nare mentioned as still existing by Diodorus Siculus and Ptolemy; and\r\nthey survived down to the fifth century A.D. in the corps of _equites\r\nThamudeni_ attached to the army of the Byzantine emperors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Amálíq.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṭasm and Jadís.]\r\n\r\nBesides ‘Ád and Thamúd, the list of primitive races includes the ‘Amálíq\r\n(Amalekites)--a purely fictitious term under which the Moslem\r\nantiquaries lumped together several peoples of an age long past,_e.g._,\r\nthe Canaanites and the Philistines. We hear of Amalekite settlements in\r\nthe Tiháma (Netherland) of Mecca and in other parts of the peninsula.\r\nFinally, mention should be made of Ṭasm and Jadís, sister tribes of\r\nwhich nothing is recorded except the fact of their destruction and the\r\nevents that brought it about. The legendary narrative in which these are\r\nembodied has some archæological interest as showing the existence in\r\nearly Arabian society of a barbarous feudal custom, 'le droit du\r\nseigneur,' but it is time to pass on to the main subject of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: History of the Yoqṭánids.]\r\n\r\nThe Pre-islamic history of the Yoqṭánids, or Southern Arabs, on which we\r\nnow enter, is virtually the history of two peoples, the Sabæans and the\r\nḤimyarites, who formed the successive heads of a South Arabian empire\r\nextending from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sabæans.]\r\n\r\nSaba[24] (Sheba of the Old Testament) is often incorrectly used to\r\ndenote the whole of Arabia Felix, whereas it was only one, though\r\ndoubtless the first in power and importance, of several kingdoms, the\r\nnames and capitals of which are set down in the works of Greek and Roman\r\ngeographers. However exaggerated may be the glowing accounts that we\r\nfind there of Sabæan wealth and magnificence, it is certain that Saba\r\nwas a flourishing commercial state many centuries before the birth of\r\nChrist.[25] \"Sea-traffic between the ports of East Arabia and India was\r\nvery early established, and Indian products, especially spices and rare\r\nanimals (apes and peacocks) were conveyed to the coast of ‘Umán. Thence,\r\napparently even in the tenth century B.C., they went overland to the\r\nArabian Gulf, where they were shipped to Egypt for the use of the\r\nPharaohs and grandees.... The difficulty of navigating the Red Sea\r\ncaused the land route to be preferred for the traffic between Yemen and\r\nSyria. From Shabwat (Sabota) in Ḥaḍramawt the caravan road went to\r\nMa’rib (Mariaba), the Sabæan capital, then northward to Macoraba (the\r\nlater Mecca), and by way of Petra to Gaza on the Mediterranean.\"[26] The\r\nprosperity of the Sabæans lasted until the Indian trade, instead of\r\ngoing overland, began to go by sea along the coast of Ḥaḍramawt and\r\nthrough the straits of Báb al-Mandab. In consequence of this change,\r\nwhich seems to have taken place in the first century A.D., their power\r\ngradually declined, a great part of the population was forced to seek\r\nnew homes in the north, their cities became desolate, and their massive\r\naqueducts crumbled to pieces. We shall see presently that Arabian legend\r\nhas crystallised the results of a long period of decay into a single\r\nfact--the bursting of the Dyke of Ma’rib.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ḥimyarites.]\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the Sabæans left the way open for a younger branch\r\nof the same stock, namely, the Ḥimyarites, or, as they are called by\r\nclassical authors, Homeritæ, whose country lay between Saba and the sea.\r\nUnder their kings, known as Tubba‘s, they soon became the dominant power\r\nin South Arabia and exercised sway, at least ostensibly, over the\r\nnorthern tribes down to the end of the fifth century A.D., when the\r\nlatter revolted and, led by Kulayb b. Rabí‘a, shook off the suzerainty\r\nof Yemen in a great battle at Khazázá.[27] The Ḥimyarites never\r\nflourished like the Sabæans. Their maritime situation exposed them more\r\nto attack, while the depopulation of the country had seriously weakened\r\ntheir military strength. The Abyssinians--originally colonists from\r\nYemen--made repeated attempts to gain a foothold, and frequently managed\r\nto instal governors who were in turn expelled by native princes. Of\r\nthese Abyssinian viceroys the most famous is Abraha, whose unfortunate\r\nexpedition against Mecca will be related in due course. Ultimately the\r\nḤimyarite Empire was reduced to a Persian dependency. It had ceased to\r\nexist as a political power about a hundred years before the rise of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of information.]\r\n\r\nThe chief Arabian sources of information concerning Saba and Ḥimyar are\r\n(1) the so-called 'Ḥimyarite' inscriptions, and (2) the traditions,\r\nalmost entirely of a legendary kind, which are preserved in Muḥammadan\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The South Arabic or Sabæan inscriptions.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objections to the term 'Ḥimyarite.']\r\n\r\nAlthough the South Arabic language may have maintained itself\r\nsporadically in certain remote districts down to the Prophet's time or\r\neven later, it had long ago been superseded as a medium of daily\r\nintercourse by the language of the North, the Arabic _par excellence_,\r\nwhich henceforth reigns without a rival throughout the peninsula. The\r\ndead language, however, did not wholly perish. Already in the sixth\r\ncentury A.D. the Bedouin rider made his camel kneel down while he\r\nstopped to gaze wonderingly at inscriptions in a strange character\r\nengraved on walls of rock or fragments of hewn stone, and compared the\r\nmysterious, half-obliterated markings to the almost unrecognisable\r\ntraces of the camping-ground which for him was fraught with tender\r\nmemories. These inscriptions are often mentioned by Muḥammadan authors,\r\nwho included them in the term _Musnad_. That some Moslems--probably very\r\nfew--could not only read the South Arabic alphabet, but were also\r\nacquainted with the elementary rules of orthography, appears from a\r\npassage in the eighth book of Hamdání's _Iklíl_; but though they might\r\ndecipher proper names and make out the sense of words here and there,\r\nthey had no real knowledge of the language. How the inscriptions were\r\ndiscovered anew by the enterprise of European travellers, gradually\r\ndeciphered and interpreted until they became capable of serving as a\r\nbasis for historical research, and what results the study of them has\r\nproduced, this I shall now set forth as briefly as possible. Before\r\ndoing so it is necessary to explain why instead of 'Ḥimyarite\r\ninscriptions' and 'Ḥimyarite language' I have adopted the less familiar\r\ndesignations 'South Arabic' or 'Sabæan.' 'Ḥimyarite' is equally\r\nmisleading, whether applied to the language of the inscriptions or to\r\nthe inscriptions themselves. As regards the language, it was spoken in\r\none form or another not by the Ḥimyarites alone, but also by the\r\nSabæans, the Minæans, and all the different peoples of Yemen.\r\nMuḥammadans gave the name of 'Ḥimyarite' to the ancient language of\r\nYemen for the simple reason that the Ḥimyarites were the most powerful\r\nrace in that country during the last centuries preceding Islam. Had all\r\nthe inscriptions belonged to the period of Ḥimyarite supremacy, they\r\nmight with some justice have been named after the ruling people; but the\r\nfact is that many date from a far earlier age, some going back to the\r\neighth century B.C., perhaps nearly a thousand years before the\r\nḤimyarite Empire was established. The term 'Sabæan' is less open to\r\nobjection, for it may fairly be regarded as a national rather than a\r\npolitical denomination. On the whole, however, I prefer 'South Arabic'\r\nto either.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discovery and decipherment of the South Arabic inscriptions.]\r\n\r\nAmong the pioneers of exploration in Yemen the first to interest himself\r\nin the discovery of inscriptions was Carsten Niebuhr, whose\r\n_Beschreibung von Arabien_, published in 1772, conveyed to Europe the\r\nreport that inscriptions which, though he had not seen them, he\r\nconjectured to be 'Ḥimyarite,' existed in the ruins of the once famous\r\ncity of Ẓafár. On one occasion a Dutchman who had turned Muḥammadan\r\nshowed him the copy of an inscription in a completely unknown alphabet,\r\nbut \"at that time (he says) being very ill with a violent fever, I had\r\nmore reason to prepare myself for death than to collect old\r\ninscriptions.\"[28] Thus the opportunity was lost, but curiosity had been\r\nawakened, and in 1810 Ulrich Jasper Seetzen discovered and copied\r\nseveral inscriptions in the neighbourhood of Ẓafár. Unfortunately these\r\ncopies, which had to be made hastily, were very inexact. He also\r\npurchased an inscription, which he took away with him and copied at\r\nleisure, but his ignorance of the characters led him to mistake the\r\ndepressions in the stone for letters, so that the conclusions he came to\r\nwere naturally of no value.[29] The first serviceable copies of South\r\nArabic inscriptions were brought to Europe by English officers employed\r\non the survey of the southern and western coasts of Arabia. Lieutenant\r\nJ. R. Wellsted published the inscriptions of Ḥiṣn Ghuráb and Naqb\r\nal-Ḥajar in his _Travels in Arabia_ (1838).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Emil Rödiger, Professor of Oriental Languages at Halle, with\r\nthe help of two manuscripts of the Berlin Royal Library containing\r\n'Ḥimyarite' alphabets, took the first step towards a correct\r\ndecipherment by refuting the idea, for which De Sacy's authority had\r\ngained general acceptance, that the South Arabic script ran from left to\r\nright[30]; he showed, moreover, that the end of every word was marked by\r\na straight perpendicular line.[31] Wellsted's inscriptions, together\r\nwith those which Hulton and Cruttenden brought to light at Ṣan‘á, were\r\ndeciphered by Gesenius and Rödiger working independently (1841).\r\nHitherto England and Germany had shared the credit of discovery, but a\r\nfew years later France joined hands with them and was soon leading the\r\nway with characteristic brilliance. In 1843 Th. Arnaud, starting from\r\nṢan‘á, succeeded in discovering the ruins of Ma’rib, the ancient Sabæan\r\nmetropolis, and in copying at the risk of his life between fifty and\r\nsixty inscriptions, which were afterwards published in the _Journal\r\nAsiatique_ and found an able interpreter in Osiander.[32] Still more\r\nimportant were the results of the expedition undertaken in 1870 by the\r\nJewish scholar, Joseph Halévy, who penetrated into the Jawf, or country\r\nlying east of Ṣan‘á, which no European had traversed before him since 24\r\nB.C., when Ælius Gallus led a Roman army by the same route. After\r\nenduring great fatigues and meeting with many perilous adventures,\r\nHalévy brought back copies of nearly seven hundred inscriptions.[33]\r\nDuring the last twenty-five years much fresh material has been collected\r\nby E. Glaser and Julius Euting, while study of that already existing by\r\nPrætorius, Halévy, D. H. Müller, Mordtmann, and other scholars has\r\nsubstantially enlarged our knowledge of the language, history, and\r\nreligion of South Arabia in the Pre-islamic age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The historical value of the inscriptions.]\r\n\r\nNeither the names of the Ḥimyarite monarchs, as they appear in the lists\r\ndrawn up by Muḥammadan historians, nor the order in which these names\r\nare arranged can pretend to accuracy. If they are historical persons at\r\nall they must have reigned in fairly recent times, perhaps a short while\r\nbefore the rise of Islam, and probably they were unimportant princes\r\nwhom the legend has thrown back into the ancient epoch, and has invested\r\nwith heroic attributes. Any one who doubts this has only to compare the\r\nmodern lists with those which have been made from the material in the\r\ninscriptions.[34] D. H. Müller has collected the names of thirty-three\r\nMinæan kings. Certain names are often repeated--a proof of the existence\r\nof ruling dynasties--and ornamental epithets are usually attached to\r\nthem. Thus we find Dhamar‘alí Dhirríḥ (Glorious), Yatha‘amar Bayyin\r\n(Distinguished), Kariba’íl Watár Yuhan‘im (Great, Beneficent), Samah‘alí\r\nYanúf (Exalted). Moreover, the kings bear different titles corresponding\r\nto three distinct periods of South Arabian history, viz., 'Priest-king\r\nof Saba' (_Mukarrib Saba_),[35] 'King of Saba' (_Malk Saba_), and 'King\r\nof Saba and Raydán.' In this way it is possible to determine\r\napproximately the age of the various buildings and inscriptions, and to\r\nshow that they do not belong, as had hitherto been generally supposed,\r\nto the time of Christ, but that in some cases they are at least eight\r\nhundred years older.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Votive inscriptions.]\r\n\r\nHow widely the peaceful, commerce-loving people of Saba and Ḥimyar\r\ndiffered in character from the wild Arabs to whom Muḥammad was sent\r\nappears most strikingly in their submissive attitude towards their gods,\r\nwhich forms, as Goldziher has remarked, the keynote of the South Arabian\r\nmonuments.[36] The prince erects a thank-offering to the gods who gave\r\nhim victory over his enemies; the priest dedicates his children and all\r\nhis possessions; the warrior who has been blessed with \"due\r\nman-slayings,\" or booty, or escape from death records his gratitude, and\r\npiously hopes for a continuance of favour. The dead are conceived as\r\nliving happily under divine protection; they are venerated and sometimes\r\ndeified.[37] The following inscription, translated by Lieut.-Col. W. F.\r\nPrideaux, is a typical example of its class:--\r\n\r\n \"Sa‘d-iláh and his sons, Benú Marthadim, have endowed Il-Maḳah of\r\n  Hirrán with this tablet, because Il-Maḳah, lord of Awwám Dhú-‘Irán\r\n  Alú, has favourably heard the prayer addressed to him, and has\r\n  consequently heard the Benú Marthadim when they offered the\r\n  first-fruits of their fertile lands of Arhaḳim in the presence of\r\n  Il-Maḳah of Hirrán, and Il-Maḳah of Hirrán has favourably heard the\r\n  prayer addressed to him that he would protect the plains and meadows\r\n  and this tribe in their habitations, in consideration of the frequent\r\n  gifts throughout the year; and truly his (Sa‘d-iláh's) sons will\r\n  descend to Arhaḳim, and they will indeed sacrifice in the two shrines\r\n  of ‘Athtor and Shamsim, and there shall be a sacrifice in Hirrán--both\r\n  in order that Il-Maḳah may afford protection to those fields of Bin\r\n  Marthadim as well as that he may favourably listen--and in the\r\n  sanctuary of Il-Maḳah of Ḥarwat, and therefore may he keep them in\r\n  safety according to the sign in which Sa‘d-iláh was instructed, the\r\n  sign which he saw in the sanctuary of Il-Maḳah of Na‘mán; and as for\r\n  Il-Maḳah of Hirrán, he has protected those fertile lands of Arhaḳim\r\n  from hail and from all misfortune (_or_, from cold and from all\r\n  extreme heat).\"[38]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this very inadequate account of the South Arabic\r\ninscriptions I must claim the indulgence of my readers, who are aware\r\nhow difficult it is to write clearly and accurately upon any subject\r\nwithout first-hand knowledge, in particular when the results of previous\r\nresearch are continually being transformed by new workers in the same\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literary sources.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hamdání († 945 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nFortunately we possess a considerable literary supplement to these\r\nsomewhat austere and meagre remains. Our knowledge of South Arabian\r\ngeography, antiquities, and legendary history is largely derived from\r\nthe works of two natives of Yemen, who were filled with enthusiasm for\r\nits ancient glories, and whose writings, though different as fact and\r\nfable, are from the present point of view equally instructive--Ḥasan b.\r\nAḥmad al-Hamdání and Nashwán b. Sa‘íd al-Ḥimyarí. Besides an excellent\r\ngeography of Arabia (_Ṣifatu Jazírat al-‘Arab_), which has been edited\r\nby D. H. Müller, Hamdání left a great work on the history and\r\nantiquities of Yemen, entitled _al-Iklíl_ ('The Crown'), and divided\r\ninto ten books under the following heads:--[39]\r\n\r\n  Book I. _Compendium of the beginning and origins of genealogy._\r\n\r\n  Book II. _Genealogy of the descendants of al-Hamaysa‘ b. Ḥimyar._\r\n\r\n  Book III. _Concerning the pre-eminent qualities of Qaḥṭán._\r\n\r\n  Book IV. _Concerning the first period of history down to the reign\r\n              of Tubba‘ Abú Karib._\r\n\r\n  Book V. _Concerning the middle period from the accession of As‘ad\r\n             Tubba‘ to the reign of Dhú Nuwás._\r\n\r\n  Book VI. _Concerning the last period down to the rise of Islam._\r\n\r\n  Book VII. _Criticism of false traditions and absurd legends._\r\n\r\n  Book VIII. _Concerning the castles, cities, and tombs of the\r\n                Ḥimyarites; the extant poetry of ‘Alqama,_[40]\r\n               _the elegies, the inscriptions, and other matters._\r\n\r\n  Book IX. _Concerning the proverbs and wisdom of the Ḥimyarites in\r\n              the Ḥimyarite language, and concerning the alphabet\r\n              of the inscriptions._\r\n\r\n  Book X. _Concerning the genealogy of Ḥáshid and Bakíl_ (the two\r\n             principal tribes of Hamdán).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nashwán b. Sa‘íd al-Ḥimyarí († 1177 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Abíd b. Sharya.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥamza of Iṣfahán.]\r\n\r\nThe same intense patriotism which caused Hamdání to devote himself to\r\nscientific research inspired Nashwán b. Sa‘íd, who descended on the\r\nfather's side from one of the ancient princely families of Yemen, to\r\nrecall the legendary past and become the laureate of a long vanished and\r\nwell-nigh forgotten empire. In 'The Ḥimyarite Ode' (_al-Qaṣìdatu\r\n’l-Ḥimyariyya_) he sings the might and grandeur of the monarchs who\r\nruled over his people, and moralises in true Muḥammadan spirit upon the\r\nfleetingness of life and the futility of human ambition.[41]\r\nAccompanying the Ode, which has little value except as a comparatively\r\nunfalsified record of royal names,[42] is a copious historical\r\ncommentary either by Nashwán himself, as Von Kremer thinks highly\r\nprobable, or by some one who lived about the same time. Those for whom\r\nhistory represents an aggregate of naked facts would find nothing to the\r\npurpose in this commentary, where threads of truth are almost\r\ninextricably interwoven with fantastic and fabulous embroideries. A\r\nliterary form was first given to such legends by the professional\r\nstory-tellers of early Islam. One of these, the South Arabian ‘Abíd b.\r\nSharya, visited Damascus by command of the Caliph Mu‘áwiya I, who\r\nquestioned him \"concerning the ancient traditions, the kings of the\r\nArabs and other races, the cause of the confusion of tongues, and the\r\nhistory of the dispersion of mankind in the various countries of the\r\nworld,\"[43] and gave orders that his answers should be put together in\r\nwriting and published under his name. This work, of which unfortunately\r\nno copy has come down to us, was entitled 'The Book of the Kings and the\r\nHistory of the Ancients' (_Kitábu ’l-Mulúk wa-akhbáru ’l-Máḍín_).\r\nMas‘údí († 956 A.D.) speaks of it as a well-known book, enjoying a wide\r\ncirculation.[44] It was used by the commentator of the Ḥimyarite Ode,\r\neither at first hand or through the medium of Hamdání's _Iklíl_. We may\r\nregard it, like the commentary itself, as a historical romance in which\r\nmost of the characters and some of the events are real, adorned with\r\nfairy-tales, fictitious verses, and such entertaining matter as a man of\r\nlearning and story-teller by trade might naturally be expected to\r\nintroduce. Among the few remaining Muḥammadan authors who bestowed\r\nspecial attention on the Pre-islamic period of South Arabian history, I\r\nshall mention here only Ḥamza of Iṣfahán, the eighth book of whose\r\nAnnals (finished in 961 A.D.) provides a useful sketch, with brief\r\nchronological details, of the Tubba‘s or Ḥimyarite kings of Yemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ya‘rub.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥimyar and Kahlán.]\r\n\r\nQaḥṭán, the ancestor of the Southern Arabs, was succeeded by his son\r\nYa‘rub, who is said to have been the first to use the Arabic language,\r\nand the first to receive the salutations with which the Arabs were\r\naccustomed to address their kings, viz., \"_In‘im ṣabáḥan_\" (\"Good\r\nmorning!\") and \"_Abayta ’l-la‘na_\" (\"Mayst thou avoid malediction!\").\r\nHis grandson, ‘Abd Shams Saba, is named as the founder of Ma’rib and the\r\nbuilder of the famous Dyke, which, according to others, was constructed\r\nby Luqmán b. ‘Ád. Saba had two sons, Ḥimyar and Kahlán. Before his death\r\nhe deputed the sovereign authority to Ḥimyar, and the task of protecting\r\nthe frontiers and making war upon the enemy to Kahlán. Thus Ḥimyar\r\nobtained the lordship, assumed the title Abú Ayman, and abode in the\r\ncapital city of the realm, while Kahlán took over the defence of the\r\nborders and the conduct of war.[45] Omitting the long series of mythical\r\nSabæan kings, of whom the legend has little or nothing to relate, we now\r\ncome to an event which fixed itself ineffaceably in the memory of the\r\nArabs, and which is known in their traditions as _Saylu ’l-‘Arim_, or\r\nthe Flood of the Dyke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dam of Ma’rib.]\r\n\r\nSome few miles south-west of Ma’rib the mountains draw together leaving\r\na gap, through which flows the River Adana. During the summer its bed is\r\noften dry, but in the rainy season the water rushes down with such\r\nviolence that it becomes impassable. In order to protect the city from\r\nfloods, and partly also for purposes of irrigation, the inhabitants\r\nbuilt a dam of solid masonry, which, long after it had fallen into ruin,\r\nstruck the imagination of Muḥammad, and was reckoned by Moslems among\r\nthe wonders of the world.[46] That their historians have clothed the\r\nbare fact of its destruction in ample robes of legendary circumstance is\r\nnot surprising, but renders abridgment necessary.[47]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its destruction announced by portents.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the third century of our era, or possibly at an\r\nearlier epoch,[48] the throne of Ma’rib was temporarily occupied by ‘Amr\r\nb. ‘Ámir Má’ al-Samá, surnamed Muzayqiyá.[49] His wife, Ẓarífa, was\r\nskilled in the art of divination. She dreamed dreams and saw visions\r\nwhich announced the impending calamity. \"Go to the Dyke,\" she said to\r\nher husband, who doubted her clairvoyance, \"and if thou see a rat\r\ndigging holes in the Dyke with its paws and moving huge boulders with\r\nits hind-legs, be assured that the woe hath come upon us.\" So ‘Amr went\r\nto the Dyke and looked carefully, and lo, there was a rat moving an\r\nenormous rock which fifty men could not have rolled from its place.\r\nConvinced by this and other prodigies that the Dyke would soon burst and\r\nthe land be laid waste, he resolved to sell his possessions and depart\r\nwith his family; and, lest conduct so extraordinary should arouse\r\nsuspicion, he had recourse to the following stratagem. He invited the\r\nchief men of the city to a splendid feast, which, in accordance with a\r\npreconcerted plan, was interrupted by a violent altercation between\r\nhimself and his son (or, as others relate, an orphan who had been\r\nbrought up in his house). Blows were exchanged, and ‘Amr cried out, \"O\r\nshame! on the day of my glory a stripling has insulted me and struck my\r\nface.\" He swore that he would put his son to death, but the guests\r\nentreated him to show mercy, until at last he gave way. \"But by God,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"I will no longer remain in a city where I have suffered this\r\nindignity. I will sell my lands and my stock.\" Having successfully got\r\nrid of his encumbrances--for there was no lack of buyers eager to take\r\nhim at his word--‘Amr informed the people of the danger with which they\r\nwere threatened, and set out from Ma’rib at the head of a great\r\nmultitude. Gradually the waters made a breach in the Dyke and swept over\r\nthe country, spreading devastation far and wide. Hence the proverb\r\n_Dhahabú_ (or _tafarraqú_) _aydí Saba_, \"They departed\" (or \"dispersed\")\r\n\"like the people of Saba.\"[50]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of the Sabæan Empire.]\r\n\r\nThis deluge marks an epoch in the history of South Arabia. The waters\r\nsubside, the land returns to cultivation and prosperity, but Ma’rib lies\r\ndesolate, and the Sabæans have disappeared for ever, except \"to point a\r\nmoral or adorn a tale.\" Al-A‘shá sang:--\r\n\r\n                          ⌣|    ⌣|    ⌣|\r\n  Metre _Mutaqárib_: (⌣ - -|⌣ - -|⌣ - -|⌣ -).\r\n\r\n \"Let this warn whoever a warning will take--\r\n  And Ma’rib withal, which the Dam fortified.\r\n  Of marble did Ḥimyar construct it, so high,\r\n  The waters recoiled when to reach it they tried.\r\n  It watered their acres and vineyards, and hour\r\n  By hour, did a portion among them divide.\r\n  So lived they in fortune and plenty until\r\n  Therefrom turned away by a ravaging tide.\r\n  Then wandered their princes and noblemen through\r\n  Mirage-shrouded deserts that baffle the guide.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThe poet's reference to Ḥimyar is not historically accurate. It was only\r\nafter the destruction of the Dyke and the dispersion of the Sabæans who\r\nbuilt it[52] that the Ḥimyarites, with their capital Ẓafár (at a later\r\nperiod, Ṣan‘á) became the rulers of Yemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tubba‘s.]\r\n\r\nThe first Tubba‘, by which name the Ḥimyarite kings are known to\r\nMuḥammadan writers, was Ḥárith, called al-Rá’ish, _i.e._, the Featherer,\r\nbecause he 'feathered' his people's nest with the booty which he brought\r\nhome as a conqueror from India and Ádharbayján.[53] Of the Tubba‘s who\r\ncome after him some obviously owe their place in the line of Ḥimyar to\r\ngenealogists whose respect for the Koran was greater than their critical\r\nacumen. Such a man of straw is Ṣa‘b Dhu ’l-Qarnayn (Ṣa‘b the\r\nTwo-horned).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dhu ’l-Qarnayn.]\r\n\r\nThe following verses show that he is a double of the mysterious Dhu\r\n’l-Qarnayn of Koranic legend, supposed by most commentators to be\r\nidentical with Alexander the Great[54]:--\r\n\r\n \"Ours the realm of Dhu ’l-Qarnayn the glorious,\r\n  Realm like his was never won by mortal king.\r\n  Followed he the Sun to view its setting\r\n  When it sank into the sombre ocean-spring;\r\n  Up he clomb to see it rise at morning,\r\n  From within its mansion when the East it fired;\r\n  All day long the horizons led him onward,[55]\r\n  All night through he watched the stars and never tired.\r\n  Then of iron and of liquid metal\r\n  He prepared a rampart not to be o'erpassed,\r\n  Gog and Magog there he threw in prison\r\n  Till on Judgment Day they shall awake at last.\"[56]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bilqís.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, among the Tubba‘s we find the Queen of Sheba, whose\r\nadventures with Solomon are related in the twenty-seventh chapter of the\r\nKoran. Although Muḥammad himself did not mention her name or lineage,\r\nhis interpreters were equal to the occasion and revealed her as Bilqís,\r\nthe daughter of Sharáḥíl (Sharaḥbíl).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As‘ad Kámil.]\r\n\r\nThe national hero of South Arabian legend is the Tubba‘ As‘ad Kámil, or,\r\nas he is sometimes called, Abú Karib. Even at the present day, says Von\r\nKremer, his memory is kept alive, and still haunts the ruins of his\r\npalace at Ẓafár. \"No one who reads the Ballad of his Adventures or the\r\nwords of exhortation which he addressed on his deathbed to his son\r\nḤassán can escape from the conviction that here we have to do with\r\ngenuine folk-poetry--fragments of a South Arabian legendary cycle, the\r\nbeginnings of which undoubtedly reach back to a high antiquity.\"[57] I\r\ntranslate here the former of these pieces, which may be entitled\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALLAD OF THE THREE WITCHES.[58]\r\n\r\n  \"Time brings to pass full many a wonder\r\n   Whereof the lesson thou must ponder.\r\n   Whilst all to thee seems ordered fair,\r\n   Lo, Fate hath wrought confusion there.\r\n   Against a thing foredoomed to be\r\n   Nor cunning nor caution helpeth thee.\r\n   Now a marvellous tale will I recite;\r\n   Trust me to know and tell it aright!\r\n\r\n   Once on a time was a boy of Asd\r\n   Who became the king of the land at last,\r\n   Born in Hamdán, a villager;\r\n   The name of that village was Khamir.\r\n   This lad in the pride of youth defied\r\n   His friends, and they with scorn replied.\r\n   None guessed his worth till he was grown\r\n   Ready to spring.\r\n\r\n                      One morn, alone\r\n   On Hinwam hill he was sore afraid.[59]\r\n   (His people knew not where he strayed;\r\n   They had seen him only yesternight,\r\n   For his youth and wildness they held him light.\r\n   The wretches! Him they never missed\r\n   Who had been their glory had they wist).\r\n\r\n   O the fear that fell on his heart when he\r\n   Saw beside him the witches three!\r\n   The eldest came with many a brew--\r\n   In some was blood, blood-dark their hue.\r\n  'Give me the cup!' he shouted bold;\r\n  'Hold, hold!' cried she, but he would not hold.\r\n   She gave him the cup, nor he did shrink\r\n   Tho' he reeled as he drained the magic drink.\r\n\r\n   Then the second yelled at him. Her he faced\r\n   Like a lion with anger in his breast.\r\n  'These be our steeds, come mount,' she cried,\r\n  'For asses are worst of steeds to ride.'\r\n ''Tis sooth,' he answered, and slipped his flank\r\n   O'er a hyena lean and lank,\r\n   But the brute so fiercely flung him away,\r\n   With deep, deep wounds on the earth he lay.\r\n   Then came the youngest and tended him\r\n   On a soft bed, while her eyes did swim\r\n   In tears; but he averted his face\r\n   And sought a rougher resting-place:\r\n   Such paramour he deemed too base.\r\n   And him thought, in anguish lying there,\r\n   That needles underneath him were.[60]\r\n\r\n   Now when they had marked his mien so bold,\r\n   Victory in all things they foretold.\r\n   'The wars, O As‘ad, waged by thee\r\n   Shall heal mankind of misery.\r\n   Thy sword and spear the foe shall rue\r\n   When his gashes let the daylight through;\r\n   And blood shall flow on every hand\r\n   What time thou marchest from land to land.\r\n   By us be counselled: stay not within\r\n   Khamir, but go to Ẓafár and win!\r\n   To thee shall dalliance ne'er be dear,\r\n   Thy foes shall see thee before they hear.\r\n   Desire moved to encounter thee,\r\n   Noble prince, us witches three.\r\n   Not jest, but earnest on thee we tried,\r\n   And well didst thou the proof abide.'\r\n\r\n   As‘ad went home and told his folk\r\n   What he had seen, but no heed they took.\r\n   On the tenth day he set out again\r\n   And fared to Ẓafár with thoughts in his brain.\r\n   There fortune raised him to high renown:\r\n   None swifter to strike ever wore a crown.[61]\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Thus found we the tale in memory stored,\r\n   And Almighty is the Lord.\r\n   Praise be to God who liveth aye,\r\n   The Glorious to whom all men pray!\"\r\n\r\nLegend makes As‘ad the hero of a brilliant expedition to Persia, where\r\nhe defeated the general sent against him by the Arsacids, and penetrated\r\nto the Caspian Sea. On his way home he marched through the Ḥijáz, and\r\nhaving learned that his son, whom he left behind in Medína, had been\r\ntreacherously murdered, he resolved to take a terrible vengeance on the\r\npeople of that city.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: As‘ad Kámil and the two Rabbins of Medína.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: As‘ad Kámil at Mecca.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: He seeks to establish Judaism in Yemen.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The ordeal of fire.]\r\n\r\n \"Now while the Tubba‘ was carrying on war against them, there came to\r\n  him two Jewish Rabbins of the Banú Qurayẓa, men deep in knowledge, who\r\n  when they heard that he wished to destroy the city and its people,\r\n  said to him: 'O King, forbear! Verily, if thou wilt accept nothing\r\n  save that which thou desirest, an intervention will be made betwixt\r\n  thee and the city, and we are not sure but that sudden chastisement\r\n  may befall thee.' 'Why so?' he asked. They answered: ''Tis the place\r\n  of refuge of a prophet who in the after time shall go forth from the\r\n  sacred territory of Quraysh: it shall be his abode and his home.' So\r\n  the king refrained himself, for he saw that those two had a particular\r\n  knowledge, and he was pleased with what they told him. On departing\r\n  from Medína he followed them in their religion.[62]... And he turned\r\n  his face towards Mecca, that being his way to Yemen, and when he was\r\n  between ‘Usfán and Amaj some Hudhalites came to him and said: 'O King,\r\n  shall we not guide thee to a house of ancient treasure which the kings\r\n  before thee neglected, wherein are pearls and emeralds and chrysolites\r\n  and gold and silver?' He said, 'Yea.' They said: 'It is a temple at\r\n  Mecca which those who belong to it worship and in which they pray.'\r\n  Now the Hudhalites wished to destroy him thereby, knowing that\r\n  destruction awaited the king who should seek to violate its precinct.\r\n  So on comprehending what they proposed, he sent to the two Rabbins to\r\n  ask them about the affair. They replied: 'These folk intend naught but\r\n  to destroy thee and thine army; we wot not of any house in the world\r\n  that God hath chosen for Himself, save this. If thou do that to which\r\n  they invite thee, thou and those with thee will surely perish\r\n  together.' He said: 'What then is it ye bid me do when I come there?'\r\n  They said: 'Thou wilt do as its people do--make the circuit thereof,\r\n  and magnify and honour it, and shave thy head, and humble thyself\r\n  before it, until thou go forth from its precinct.' He said: 'And what\r\n  hinders you from doing that yourselves?' 'By God,' said they, 'it is\r\n  the temple of our father Abraham, and verily it is even as we told\r\n  thee, but we are debarred therefrom by the idols which its people have\r\n  set up around it and by the blood-offerings which they make beside it;\r\n  for they are vile polytheists,' or words to the same effect. The king\r\n  perceived that their advice was good and their tale true. He ordered\r\n  the Hudhalites to approach, and cut off their hands and feet. Then he\r\n  continued his march to Mecca, where he made the circuit of the temple,\r\n  sacrificed camels, and shaved his head. According to what is told, he\r\n  stayed six days at Mecca, feasting the inhabitants with the flesh of\r\n  camels and letting them drink honey.[63]... Then he moved out with his\r\n  troops in the direction of Yemen, the two Rabbins accompanying him;\r\n  and on entering Yemen he called on his subjects to adopt the religion\r\n  which he himself had embraced, but they refused unless the question\r\n  were submitted to the ordeal of fire which at that time existed in\r\n  Yemen; for as the Yemenites say, there was in their country a fire\r\n  that gave judgment between them in their disputes: it devoured the\r\n  wrong-doer but left the injured person unscathed. The Yemenites\r\n  therefore came forward with their idols and whatever else they used as\r\n  a means of drawing nigh unto God, and the two Rabbins came forward\r\n  with their scriptures hung on their necks like necklaces, and both\r\n  parties seated themselves at the place from which the fire was wont to\r\n  issue. And the fire blazed up, and the Yemenites shrank back from it\r\n  as it approached them, and were afraid, but the bystanders urged them\r\n  on and bade them take courage. So they held out until the fire\r\n  enveloped them and consumed the idols and images and the men of\r\n  Ḥimyar, the bearers thereof; but the Rabbins came forth safe and\r\n  sound, their brows moist with sweat, and the scriptures were still\r\n  hanging on their necks. Thereupon the Ḥimyarites consented to adopt\r\n  the king's religion, and this was the cause of Judaism being\r\n  established in Yemen.\"[64]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As‘ad's farewell to his son.]\r\n\r\nThe poem addressed to his son and successor, Ḥassán, which tradition has\r\nput into his mouth, is a sort of last will and testament, of which the\r\ngreater part is taken up with an account of his conquests and with\r\nglorification of his family and himself.[65] Nearly all that we find in\r\nthe way of maxims or injunctions suitable to the solemn occasion is\r\ncontained in the following verses:--\r\n\r\n \"O Ḥassán, the hour of thy father's death has arrived at last:\r\n  Look to thyself ere yet the time for looking is past.\r\n  Oft indeed are the mighty abased, and often likewise\r\n  Are the base exalted: such is Man who is born and dies.\r\n  Bid ye Ḥimyar know that standing erect would I buried be,\r\n  And have my wine-skins and Yemen robes in the tomb with me.[66]\r\n  And hearken thou to my Sibyl, for surely can she foresay\r\n  The truth, and safe in her keeping is castle Ghaymán aye.[67]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The castles of Yemen.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ghumdán.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with Ghaymán a few words may be added respecting the\r\ncastles in Yemen, of which the ruined skeletons rising from solitary\r\nheights seem still to frown defiance upon the passing traveller. Two\r\nthousand years ago, and probably long before, they were occupied by\r\npowerful barons, more or less independent, who in later times, when the\r\nḤimyarite Empire had begun to decline, always elected, and occasionally\r\ndeposed, their royal master. Of these castles the geographer Hamdání has\r\ngiven a detailed account in the eighth book of his great work on the\r\nhistory and antiquities of Yemen entitled the _Iklíl_, or 'Crown.'[68]\r\nThe oldest and most celebrated was Ghumdán, the citadel of Ṣan‘á. It is\r\ndescribed as a huge edifice of twenty stories, each story ten cubits\r\nhigh. The four façades were built with stone of different colours,\r\nwhite, black, green, and red. On the top story was a chamber which had\r\nwindows of marble framed with ebony and planewood. Its roof was a slab\r\nof pellucid marble, so that when the lord of Ghumdán lay on his couch he\r\nsaw the birds fly overhead, and could distinguish a raven from a kite.\r\nAt each corner stood a brazen lion, and when the wind blew it entered\r\nthe hollow interior of the effigies and made a sound like the roaring of\r\nlions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zarqá’u ’l-Yamáma.]\r\n\r\nThe adventure of As‘ad Kámil with the three witches must have recalled\r\nto every reader certain scenes in _Macbeth_. Curiously enough, in the\r\nhistory of his son Ḥassán an incident is related which offers a striking\r\nparallel to the march of Birnam Wood. Ṭasm and Jadís have already been\r\nmentioned. On the massacre of the former tribe by the latter, a single\r\nṬasmite named Ribáḥ b. Murra made his escape and took refuge with the\r\nTubba‘ Ḥassán, whom he persuaded to lead an expedition against the\r\nmurderers. Now Ribáḥ's sister had married a man of Jadís. Her name was\r\nZarqá’u ’l-Yamáma--_i.e._, the Blue-eyed Woman of Yamáma--and she had\r\nsuch piercing sight that she was able to descry an army thirty miles\r\naway. Ḥassán therefore bade his horsemen hold in front of them leafy\r\nbranches which they tore down from the trees. They advanced thus hidden,\r\nand towards evening, when they had come within a day's journey, Zarqá\r\nsaid to her people: \"I see trees marching.\" No one believed her until it\r\nwas too late. Next morning Ḥassán fell upon them and put the whole tribe\r\nto the sword.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥassán murdered by his brother.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dhú Ru‘ayn.]\r\n\r\nThe warlike expeditions to which Ḥassán devoted all his energy were felt\r\nas an intolerable burden by the chiefs of Ḥimyar, who formed a plot to\r\nslay him and set his brother ‘Amr on the throne. ‘Amr was at first\r\nunwilling to lend himself to their designs, but ultimately his scruples\r\nwere overcome, and he stabbed the Tubba‘ with his own hand. The assassin\r\nsuffered a terrible punishment. Sleep deserted him, and in his remorse\r\nhe began to execute the conspirators one after another. There was,\r\nhowever, a single chief called Dhú Ru‘ayn, who had remained loyal and\r\nhad done his best to save ‘Amr from the guilt of fratricide. Finding his\r\nefforts fruitless, he requested ‘Amr to take charge of a sealed paper\r\nwhich he brought with him, and to keep it in a safe place until he\r\nshould ask for it. ‘Amr consented and thought no more of the matter.\r\nAfterwards, imagining that Dhú Ru‘ayn had joined in the fatal plot, he\r\ngave orders for his execution. \"How!\" exclaimed Dhú Ru‘ayn, \"did not I\r\ntell thee what the crime involved?\" and he asked for the sealed writing,\r\nwhich was found to contain these verses--\r\n\r\n \"O fool to barter sleep for waking! Blest\r\n  Is he alone whose eyelids close in rest.\r\n  Hath Ḥimyar practised treason, yet 'tis plain\r\n  That God forgiveness owes to Dhú Ru‘ayn.[69]\"\r\n\r\nOn reading this, ‘Amr recognised that Dhú Ru‘ayn had spoken the truth,\r\nand he spared his life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dhú Nuwás.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of the Christians in Najrán (523 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Dhú Nuwás.]\r\n\r\nWith ‘Amr the Tubba‘ dynasty comes to an end. The succeeding kings were\r\nelected by eight of the most powerful barons, who in reality were\r\nindependent princes, each ruling in his strong castle over as many\r\nvassals and retainers as he could bring into subjection. During this\r\nperiod the Abyssinians conquered at least some part of the country, and\r\nChristian viceroys were sent by the Najáshí (Negus) to govern it in his\r\nname. At last Dhú Nuwás, a descendant of the Tubba‘ As‘ad Kámil, crushed\r\nthe rebellious barons and made himself unquestioned monarch of Yemen. A\r\nfanatical adherent of Judaism, he resolved to stamp out Christianity in\r\nNajrán, where it is said to have been introduced from Syria by a holy\r\nman called Faymiyún (Phemion). The Ḥimyarites flocked to his standard,\r\nnot so much from religious motives as from hatred of the Abyssinians.\r\nThe pretended murder of two Jewish children gave Dhú Nuwás a plausible\r\n_casus belli_. He marched against Najrán with an overwhelming force,\r\nentered the city, and bade the inhabitants choose between Judaism and\r\ndeath. Many perished by the sword; the rest were thrown into a trench\r\nwhich the king ordered to be dug and filled with blazing fire. Nearly a\r\nhundred years later, when Muḥammad was being sorely persecuted, he\r\nconsoled and encouraged his followers by the example of the Christians\r\nof Najrán, who suffered \"_for no other reason but that they believed in\r\nthe mighty, the glorious God_.\"[70] Dhú Nuwás paid dearly for his\r\ntriumph. Daws Dhú Tha‘labán, one of those who escaped from the massacre,\r\nfled to the Byzantine emperor and implored him, as the head of\r\nChristendom, to assist them in obtaining vengeance. Justinus accordingly\r\nwrote a letter to the Najáshí, desiring him to take action, and ere long\r\nan Abyssinian army, 70,000 strong, under the command of Aryáṭ,\r\ndisembarked in Yemen. Dhú Nuwás could not count on the loyalty of the\r\nḤimyarite nobles; his troops melted away. \"When he saw the fate that had\r\nbefallen himself and his people, he turned to the sea and setting spurs\r\nto his horse, rode through the shallows until he reached the deep water.\r\nThen he plunged into the waves and nothing more of him was seen.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThus died, or thus at any rate should have died, the last representative\r\nof the long line of Ḥimyarite kings. Henceforth Yemen appears in\r\nPre-islamic history only as an Abyssinian dependency or as a Persian\r\nprotectorate. The events now to be related form the prologue to a new\r\ndrama in which South Arabia, so far from being the centre of interest,\r\nplays an almost insignificant rôle.[72]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Yemen under Abyssinian rule.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Abraha and Aryáṭ.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Abraha viceroy of Yemen.]\r\n\r\n  On the death of Dhú Nuwás, the Abyssinian general Aryáṭ continued\r\n  his march through Yemen. He slaughtered a third part of the males,\r\n  laid waste a third part of the land, and sent a third part of the\r\n  women and children to the Najáshí as slaves. Having reduced the\r\n  Yemenites to submission and re-established order, he held the\r\n  position of viceroy for several years. Then mutiny broke out in the\r\n  Abyssinian army of occupation, and his authority was disputed by an\r\n  officer, named Abraha. When the rivals faced each other, Abraha said\r\n  to Aryáṭ: \"What will it avail you to engage the Abyssinians in a\r\n  civil war that will leave none of them alive? Fight it out with me,\r\n  and let the troops follow the victor.\" His challenge being accepted,\r\n  Abraha stepped forth. He was a short, fleshy man, compactly built, a\r\n  devout Christian, while Aryáṭ was big, tall, and handsome. When\r\n  the duel began, Aryáṭ thrust his spear with the intention of\r\n  piercing Abraha's brain, but it glanced off his forehead, slitting\r\n  his eyelid, nose, and lip--hence the name, _al-Ashram_, by which\r\n  Abraha was afterwards known; and ere he could repeat the blow, a\r\n  youth in Abraha's service, called ‘Atwada, who was seated on a\r\n  hillock behind his master, sprang forward and dealt him a mortal\r\n  wound. Thus Abraha found himself commander-in-chief of the\r\n  Abyssinian army, but the Najáshí was enraged and swore not to rest\r\n  until he set foot on the soil of Yemen and cut off the rebel's\r\n  forelock. On hearing this, Abraha wrote to the Najáshí: \"O King,\r\n  Aryáṭ was thy servant even as I am. We quarrelled over thy\r\n  command, both of us owing allegiance to thee, but I had more\r\n  strength than he to command the Abyssinians and keep discipline and\r\n  exert authority. When I heard of the king's oath, I shore my head,\r\n  and now I send him a sack of the earth of Yemen that he may put it\r\n  under his feet and fulfil his oath.\" The Najáshí answered this act\r\n  of submission by appointing Abraha to be his viceroy.... Then Abraha\r\n  built the church (_al-Qalís_) at San‘á, the like of which was not to\r\n  be seen at that time in the whole world, and wrote to the Najáshí\r\n  that he would not be content until he had diverted thither every\r\n  pilgrim in Arabia. This letter made much talk, and a man of the Banú\r\n  Fuqaym, one of those who arranged the calendar, was angered by what\r\n  he learned of Abraha's purpose; so he went into the church and\r\n  defiled it. When Abraha heard that the author of the outrage\r\n  belonged to the people of the Temple in Mecca, and that he meant to\r\n  show thereby his scorn and contempt for the new foundation, he waxed\r\n  wroth and swore that he would march against the Temple and lay it in\r\n  ruins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sayf b. Dhí Yazan.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Persians in Yemen (_circa_ 572 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe disastrous failure of this expedition, which took place in the year\r\nof the Elephant (570 A.D.), did not at once free Yemen from the\r\nAbyssinian yoke. The sons of Abraha, Yaksum and Masrúq, bore heavily on\r\nthe Arabs. Seeing no help among his own people, a noble Ḥimyarite named\r\nSayf b. Dhí Yazan resolved to seek foreign intervention. His choice lay\r\nbetween the Byzantine and Persian empires, and he first betook himself\r\nto Constantinople. Disappointed there, he induced the Arab king of Ḥíra,\r\nwho was under Persian suzerainty, to present him at the court of Madá’in\r\n(Ctesiphon). How he won audience of the Sásánian monarch, Núshírwán,\r\nsurnamed the Just, and tempted him by an ingenious trick to raise a\r\nforce of eight hundred condemned felons, who were set free and shipped\r\nto Yemen under the command of an aged general; how they literally\r\n'burned their boats' and, drawing courage from despair, routed the\r\nAbyssinian host and made Yemen a satrapy of Persia[73]--this forms an\r\nalmost epic narrative, which I have omitted here (apart from\r\nconsiderations of space) because it belongs to Persian rather than to\r\nArabian literary history, being probably based, as Nöldeke has\r\nsuggested, on traditions handed down by the Persian conquerors who\r\nsettled in Yemen to their aristocratic descendants whom the Arabs called\r\n_al-Abná_ (the Sons) or _Banu ’l-Aḥrár_ (Sons of the Noble).\r\n\r\nLeaving the once mighty kingdom of Yemen thus pitiably and for ever\r\nfallen from its high estate, we turn northward into the main stream of\r\nArabian history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY AND LEGENDS OF THE PAGAN ARABS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Age of Barbarism (al-Jáhiliyya).]\r\n\r\nMuḥammadans include the whole period of Arabian history from the\r\nearliest times down to the establishment of Islam in the term\r\n_al-Jáhiliyya_, which was used by Muḥammad in four passages of the Koran\r\nand is generally translated 'the state or ignorance' or simply 'the\r\nIgnorance.' Goldziher, however, has shown conclusively that the meaning\r\nattached to _jahl_ (whence _Jáhiliyya_ is derived) by the Pre-islamic\r\npoets is not so much 'ignorance' as 'wildness,' 'savagery,' and that its\r\ntrue antithesis is not _‘ilm_ (knowledge), but rather _ḥilm_, which\r\ndenotes the moral reasonableness of a civilised man. \"When Muḥammadans\r\nsay that Islam put an end to the manners and customs of the _Jáhiliyya_,\r\nthey have in view those barbarous practices, that savage temper, by\r\nwhich Arabian heathendom is distinguished from Islam and by the\r\nabolition of which Muḥammad sought to work a moral reformation in his\r\ncountrymen: the haughty spirit of the _Jáhiliyya_ (_ḥamiyyatu\r\n’l-Jáhiliyya_), the tribal pride and the endless tribal feuds, the cult\r\nof revenge, the implacability and all the other pagan characteristics\r\nwhich Islam was destined to overcome.\"[74]\r\n\r\nOur sources of information regarding this period may be classified as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of information concerning the Jáhiliyya.]\r\n\r\n(1) _Poems and fragments of verse_, which though not written down at the\r\ntime were preserved by oral tradition and committed to writing, for the\r\nmost part, two or three hundred years afterwards. The importance of\r\nthis, virtually the sole contemporary record of Pre-islamic history, is\r\nrecognised in the well-known saying, \"Poetry is the public register of\r\nthe Arabs (_al-shi‘ru díwánu ’l-‘Arab_); thereby genealogies are kept in\r\nmind and famous actions are made familiar.\" Some account of the chief\r\ncollections of old Arabian poetry will be given in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n(2) _Proverbs._ These are of less value, as they seldom explain\r\nthemselves, while the commentary attached to them is the work of\r\nscholars bent on explaining them at all costs, though in many cases\r\ntheir true meaning could only be conjectured and the circumstances of\r\ntheir origin had been entirely forgotten. Notwithstanding this very\r\npardonable excess of zeal, we could ill afford to lose the celebrated\r\ncollections of Mufaḍḍal b. Salama († _circa_ 900 A.D.) and Maydání (†\r\n1124 A.D.),[75] which contain so much curious information throwing light\r\non every aspect of Pre-islamic life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Book of Songs._]\r\n\r\n(3) _Traditions and legends._ Since the art of writing was neither\r\nunderstood nor practised by the heathen Arabs in general, it was\r\nimpossible that Prose, as a literary form, should exist among them. The\r\ngerms of Arabic Prose, however, may be traced back to the _Jáhiliyya_.\r\nBesides the proverb (_mathal_) and the oration (_khuṭba_) we find\r\nelements of history and romance in the prose narratives used by the\r\nrhapsodists to introduce and set forth plainly the matter of their\r\nsongs, and in the legends which recounted the glorious deeds of tribes\r\nand individuals. A vast number of such stories--some unmistakably\r\ngenuine, others bearing the stamp of fiction--are preserved in various\r\nliterary, historical, and geographical works composed under the ‘Abbásid\r\nCaliphate, especially in the _Kitábu ’l-Aghání_ (Book of Songs) by Abu\r\n’l-Faraj of Iṣfahán († 967 A.D.), an invaluable compilation based on the\r\nresearches of the great Humanists as they have been well named by Sir\r\nCharles Lyall, of the second and third centuries after the Hijra.[76]\r\nThe original writings of these early critics and scholars have perished\r\nalmost without exception, and beyond the copious citations in the\r\n_Aghání_ we possess hardly any specimens of their work. \"The _Book of\r\nSongs_,\" says Ibn Khaldún, \"is the Register of the Arabs. It comprises\r\nall that they had achieved in the past of excellence in every kind of\r\npoetry, history, music, _et cetera_. So far as I am aware, no other book\r\ncan be put on a level with it in this respect. It is the final resource\r\nof the student of belles-lettres, and leaves him nothing further to\r\ndesire.\"[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scope of this chapter.]\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I shall not attempt to set in due order and\r\nconnection the confused mass of poetry and legend in which all that we\r\nknow of Pre-islamic Arabia lies deeply embedded. This task has already\r\nbeen performed with admirable skill by Caussin de Perceval in his _Essai\r\nsur l'histoire des Arabes avant l'Islamisme_,[78] and it could serve no\r\nuseful purpose to inflict a dry summary of that famous work upon the\r\nreader. The better course, I think, will be to select a few typical and\r\noutstanding features of the time and to present them, wherever possible,\r\nas they have been drawn--largely from imagination--by the Arabs\r\nthemselves. If the Arabian traditions are wanting in historical accuracy\r\nthey are nevertheless, taken as a whole, true in spirit to the Dark Age\r\nwhich they call up from the dead and reverently unfold beneath our eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Arab dynasties of Ḥíra and Ghassán.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Odenathus and Zenobia.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the third century of our era Arabia was enclosed on\r\nthe north and north-east by the rival empires of Rome and Persia, to\r\nwhich the Syrian desert, stretching right across the peninsula, formed a\r\nnatural termination. In order to protect themselves from Bedouin\r\nraiders, who poured over the frontier-provinces, and after laying hands\r\non all the booty within reach vanished as suddenly as they came, both\r\nPowers found it necessary to plant a line of garrisons along the edge of\r\nthe wilderness. Thus the tribesmen were partially held in check, but as\r\nforce alone seemed an expensive and inefficient remedy it was decided,\r\nin accordance with the well-proved maxim, _divide et impera_, to enlist\r\na number of the offending tribes in the Imperial service. Regular pay\r\nand the prospect of unlimited plunder--for in those days Rome and Persia\r\nwere almost perpetually at war--were inducements that no true Bedouin\r\ncould resist. They fought, however, as free allies under their own\r\nchiefs or phylarchs. In this way two Arabian dynasties sprang up--the\r\nGhassánids in Syria and the Lakhmites at Ḥíra, west of the\r\nEuphrates--military buffer-states, always ready to collide even when\r\nthey were not urged on by the suzerain powers behind them. The Arabs\r\nsoon showed what they were capable of when trained and disciplined in\r\narms. On the defeat of Valerian by the Chosroes Sábúr I, an Arab\r\nchieftain in Palmyra, named Udhayna (Odenathus), marched at the head of\r\na strong force against the conqueror, drove him out of Syria, and\r\npursued him up to the very walls of Madá’in, the Persian capital (265\r\nA.D.). His brilliant exploits were duly rewarded by the Emperor\r\nGallienus, who bestowed on him the title of Augustus. He was, in fact,\r\nthe acknowledged master of the Roman legions in the East when, a year\r\nlater, he was treacherously murdered. He found a worthy successor in his\r\nwife, the noble and ambitious Zenobia, who set herself the task of\r\nbuilding up a great Oriental Empire. She fared, however, no better than\r\ndid Cleopatra in a like enterprise. For a moment the issue was doubtful,\r\nbut Aurelian triumphed and the proud 'Queen of the East' was led a\r\ncaptive before his chariot through the streets of Rome (274 A.D.).\r\n\r\nThese events were not forgotten by the Arabs. It flattered their\r\nnational pride to recall that once, at any rate, Roman armies had\r\nmarched under the flag of an Arabian princess. But the legend, as told\r\nin their traditions, has little in common with reality. Not only are\r\nnames and places freely altered--Zenobia herself being confused with her\r\nSyrian general, Zabdai--but the historical setting, though dimly visible\r\nin the background, has been distorted almost beyond recognition: what\r\nremains is one of those romantic adventures which delighted the Arabs of\r\nthe _Jáhiliyya_, just as their modern descendants are never tired of\r\nlistening to the _Story of ‘Antar_ or to the _Thousand Nights and a\r\nNight_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Málik the Azdite.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jadhíma al-Abrash.]\r\n\r\nThe first king of the Arab settlers in ‘Iráq (Babylonia)[79] is said to\r\nhave been Málik the Azdite, who was accidentally shot with an arrow by\r\nhis son, Sulayma. Before he expired he uttered a verse which has become\r\nproverbial:--\r\n\r\n _U‘allimuhu ’l-rimáyata kulla yawmin\r\n  falamma ’stadda sá‘iduhú ramání._\r\n\r\n \"I taught him every day the bowman's art,\r\n  And when his arm took aim, he pierced my heart.\"\r\n\r\nMálik's kingdom, if it can properly be described as such, was\r\nconsolidated and organised by his son, Jadhíma, surnamed al-Abrash (the\r\nSpeckled)--a polite euphemism for al-Abraṣ (the Leprous). He reigned as\r\nthe vassal of Ardashír Bábakán, the founder (226 A.D.) of the Sásánian\r\ndynasty in Persia, which thereafter continued to dominate the Arabs of\r\n‘Iráq during the whole Pre-islamic period. Jadhíma is the hero of many\r\nfables and proverbs. His pride, it is said, was so overweening that he\r\nwould suffer no boon-companions except two stars called _al-Farqadán_,\r\nand when he drank wine he used to pour out a cup for each of them. He\r\nhad a page, ‘Adí b. Naṣr, with whom his sister fell in love; and in a\r\nmoment of intoxication he gave his consent to their marriage. Next\r\nmorning, furious at the trick which had been played upon him, he\r\nbeheaded the unlucky bridegroom and reviled his sister for having\r\nmarried a slave. Nevertheless, when a son was born, Jadhíma adopted the\r\nboy, and as he grew up regarded him with the utmost affection. One day\r\nthe youthful ‘Amr suddenly disappeared. For a long time no trace of him\r\ncould be found, but at last he was discovered, running wild and naked,\r\nby two brothers, Málik and ‘Aqíl, who cared for him and clothed him and\r\npresented him to the king. Overjoyed at the sight, Jadhíma promised to\r\ngrant them whatever they asked. They chose the honour, which no mortal\r\nhad hitherto obtained, of being his boon-companions, and by this title\r\n(_nadmáná Jadhíma_) they are known to fame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story of Zabbá.]\r\n\r\nJadhíma was a wise and warlike prince. In one of his expeditions he\r\ndefeated and slew ‘Amr b. Ẓarib b. Ḥassán b. Udhayna, an Arab chieftain\r\nwho had brought part of Eastern Syria and Mesopotamia under his sway,\r\nand who, as the name Udhayna indicates, is probably identical with\r\nOdenathus, the husband of Zenobia. This opinion is confirmed by the\r\nstatement of Ibn Qutayba that \"Jadhíma sought in marriage Zabbá, the\r\ndaughter of the King of Mesopotamia, who became queen after her\r\n_husband_.\"[80]--According to the view generally held by Muḥammadan\r\nauthors Zabbá[81] was the daughter of ‘Amr b. Ẓarib and was elected to\r\nsucceed him when he fell in battle. However this may be, she proved\r\nherself a woman of extraordinary courage and resolution. As a safeguard\r\nagainst attack she built two strong castles on either bank of the\r\nEuphrates and connected them by a subterranean tunnel; she made one\r\nfortress her own residence, while her sister, Zaynab, occupied the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n  Having thus secured her position she determined to take vengeance on\r\n  Jadhíma. She wrote to him that the sceptre was slipping from her\r\n  feeble grasp, that she found no man worthy of her except himself,\r\n  that she desired to unite her kingdom with his by marriage, and\r\n  begged him to come and see her. Jadhíma needed no urging. Deaf to\r\n  the warnings of his friend and counsellor, Qaṣír, he started from\r\n  Baqqa, a castle on the Euphrates. When they had travelled some\r\n  distance, Qaṣír implored him to return. \"No,\" said Jadhíma, \"the\r\n  affair was decided at Baqqa\"--words which passed into a proverb. On\r\n  approaching their destination the king saw with alarm squadrons of\r\n  cavalry between him and the city, and said to Qaṣír, \"What is the\r\n  prudent course?\" \"You left prudence at Baqqa,\" he replied; \"if the\r\n  cavalry advance and salute you as king and then retire in front of\r\n  you, the woman is sincere, but if they cover your flanks and\r\n  encompass you, they mean treachery. Mount al-‘Aṣá\"--Jadhíma's\r\n  favourite mare--\"for she cannot be overtaken or outpaced, and rejoin\r\n  your troops while there is yet time.\" Jadhíma refused to follow this\r\n  advice. Presently he was surrounded by the cavalry and captured.\r\n  Qaṣír, however, sprang on the mare's back and galloped thirty miles\r\n  without drawing rein.\r\n\r\n  When Jadhíma was brought to Zabbá she seated him on a skin of\r\n  leather and ordered her maidens to open the veins in his arm, so\r\n  that his blood should flow into a golden bowl. \"O Jadhíma,\" said\r\n  she, \"let not a single drop be lost. I want it as a cure for\r\n  madness.\" The dying man suddenly moved his arm and sprinkled with\r\n  his blood one of the marble pillars of the hall--an evil portent for\r\n  Zabbá, inasmuch as it had been prophesied by a certain soothsayer\r\n  that unless every drop of the king's blood entered the bowl, his\r\n  murder would be avenged.\r\n\r\n  Now Qaṣír came to ‘Amr b. ‘Adí, Jadhíma's nephew and son by\r\n  adoption, who has been mentioned above, and engaged to win over the\r\n  army to his side if he would take vengeance on Zabbá. \"But how?\"\r\n  cried ‘Amr; \"for she is more inaccessible than the eagle of the\r\n  air.\" \"Only help me,\" said Qaṣír, \"and you will be clear of\r\n  blame.\" He cut off his nose and ears and betook himself to Zabbá,\r\n  pretending that he had been mutilated by ‘Amr. The queen believed\r\n  what she saw, welcomed him, and gave him money to trade on her\r\n  behalf. Qaṣír hastened to the palace of ‘Amr at Ḥíra, and,\r\n  having obtained permission to ransack the royal treasury, he\r\n  returned laden with riches. Thus he gradually crept into the\r\n  confidence of Zabbá, until one day he said to her: \"It behoves every\r\n  king and queen to provide themselves with a secret passage wherein\r\n  to take refuge in case of danger.\" Zabbá answered: \"I have already\r\n  done so,\" and showed him the tunnel which she had constructed\r\n  underneath the Euphrates. His project was now ripe for execution.\r\n  With the help of ‘Amr he fitted out a caravan of a thousand camels,\r\n  each carrying two armed men concealed in sacks. When they drew near\r\n  the city of Zabbá, Qaṣír left them and rode forward to announce\r\n  their arrival to the queen, who from the walls of her capital viewed\r\n  the long train of heavily burdened camels and marvelled at the slow\r\n  pace with which they advanced. As the last camel passed through the\r\n  gates of the city the janitor pricked one of the sacks with an\r\n  ox-goad which he had with him, and hearing a cry of pain, exclaimed,\r\n  \"By God, there's mischief in the sacks!\" But it was too late. ‘Amr\r\n  and his men threw themselves upon the garrison and put them to the\r\n  sword. Zabbá sought to escape by the tunnel, but Qaṣír stood\r\n  barring the exit on the further side of the stream. She hurried\r\n  back, and there was ‘Amr facing her. Resolved that her enemy should\r\n  not taste the sweetness of vengeance, she sucked her seal-ring,\r\n  which contained a deadly poison, crying, \"By my own hand, not by\r\n  ‘Amr's!\"[82]\r\n\r\nIn the kingdoms of Ḥíra and Ghassán Pre-islamic culture attained its\r\nhighest development, and from these centres it diffused itself and made\r\nits influence felt throughout Arabia. Some account, therefore, of their\r\nhistory and of the circumstances which enabled them to assume a\r\ncivilising rôle will not be superfluous.[83]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The foundation of Ḥíra.]\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the third century after Christ a number of\r\nBedouin tribes, wholly or partly of Yemenite origin, who had formed a\r\nconfederacy and called themselves collectively Tanúkh, took advantage of\r\nthe disorder then prevailing in the Arsacid Empire to invade ‘Iráq\r\n(Babylonia) and plant their settlements in the fertile country west of\r\nthe Euphrates. While part of the intruders continued to lead a nomad\r\nlife, others engaged in agriculture, and in course of time villages and\r\ntowns grew up. The most important of these was Ḥíra (properly,\r\nal-Ḥíra, _i.e._, the Camp), which occupied a favourable and healthy\r\nsituation a few miles to the south of Kúfa, in the neighbourhood of\r\nancient Babylon.[84] According to Hishám b. Muḥammad al-Kalbí († 819\r\nor 821 A.D.), an excellent authority for the history of the Pre-islamic\r\nperiod, the inhabitants of Ḥíra during the reign of Ardashír Bábakán,\r\nthe first Sásánian king of Persia (226-241 A.D.), consisted of three\r\nclasses, viz.:--\r\n\r\n(1) The _Tanúkh_, who dwelt west of the Euphrates between Ḥíra and\r\nAnbár in tents of camel's hair.\r\n\r\n(2) The _‘Ibád_, who lived in houses in Ḥíra.\r\n\r\n(3) The _Aḥláf_ (Clients), who did not belong to either of the\r\nabove-mentioned classes, but attached themselves to the people of\r\nḤíra and lived among them--blood-guilty fugitives pursued by the\r\nvengeance of their own kin, or needy emigrants seeking to mend their\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Ibád.]\r\n\r\nNaturally the townsmen proper formed by far the most influential element\r\nin the population. Hishám, as we have seen, calls them 'the ‘Ibád.' His\r\nuse of this term, however, is not strictly accurate. The ‘Ibád are\r\nexclusively the _Christian Arabs of Ḥíra_, and are so called in\r\nvirtue of their Christianity; the pagan Arabs, who at the time when\r\nḤíra was founded and for long afterwards constituted the bulk of the\r\ncitizens, were never comprised in a designation which expresses the very\r\nopposite of paganism. _‘Ibád_ means 'servants,' _i.e._, those who serve\r\nGod or Christ. It cannot be determined at what epoch the name was first\r\nused to distinguish the religious community, composed of members of\r\ndifferent tribes, which was dominant in Ḥíra during the sixth\r\ncentury. Dates are comparatively of little importance; what is really\r\nremarkable is the existence in Pre-islamic times of an Arabian community\r\nthat was not based on blood-relationship or descent from a common\r\nancestor, but on a spiritual principle, namely, the profession of a\r\ncommon faith. The religion and culture of the ‘Ibád were conveyed by\r\nvarious channels to the inmost recesses of the peninsula, as will be\r\nshown more fully in a subsequent chapter. They were the schoolmasters of\r\nthe heathen Arabs, who could seldom read or write, and who, it must be\r\nowned, so far from desiring to receive instruction, rather gloried in\r\ntheir ignorance of accomplishments which they regarded as servile.\r\nNevertheless, the best minds among the Bedouins were irresistibly\r\nattracted to Ḥíra. Poets in those days found favour with princes. A\r\ngreat number of Pre-islamic bards visited the Lakhmite court, while\r\nsome, like Nábigha and ‘Abíd b. al-Abraṣ, made it their permanent\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lakhmites.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nu‘mán I. (_circa_ 400 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Castle of Khawarnaq.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nu‘mán becomes an anchorite.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enter into the vexed question as to the origin and\r\nrise of the Lakhmite dynasty at Ḥíra. According to Hishám b.\r\nMuḥammad al-Kalbi, who gives a list of twenty kings, covering a\r\nperiod of 522 years and eight months, the first Lakhmite ruler was ‘Amr\r\nb. ‘Adí b. Naṣr b. Rabí‘a b. Lakhm, the same who was adopted by\r\nJadhíma, and afterwards avenged his death on Queen Zabbá. Almost nothing\r\nis known of his successors until we come to Nu‘mán I, surnamed al-A‘war\r\n(the One-eyed), whose reign falls in the first quarter of the fifth\r\ncentury. Nu‘mán is renowned in legend as the builder of Khawarnaq, a\r\nfamous castle near Ḥíra. It was built at the instance of the Sásánian\r\nking, Yazdigird I, who desired a salubrious residence for his son,\r\nPrince Bahrám Gór. On its completion, Nu‘mán ordered the architect, a\r\n'Roman' (_i.e._, Byzantine subject) named Sinimmár, to be cast headlong\r\nfrom the battlements, either on account of his boast that he could have\r\nconstructed a yet more wonderful edifice \"which should turn round with\r\nthe sun,\" or for fear that he might reveal the position of a certain\r\nstone, the removal of which would cause the whole building to collapse.\r\nOne spring day (so the story is told) Nu‘mán sat with his Vizier in\r\nKhawarnaq, which overlooked the Fen-land (al-Najaf), with its\r\nneighbouring gardens and plantations of palm-trees and canals, to the\r\nwest, and the Euphrates to the east. Charmed by the beauty of the\r\nprospect, he exclaimed, \"Hast thou ever seen the like of this?\" \"No,\"\r\nreplied the Vizier, \"if it would but last.\" \"And what is lasting?\" asked\r\nNu‘mán. \"That which is with God in heaven.\" \"How can one attain to it?\"\r\n\"By renouncing the world and serving God, and striving after that which\r\nHe hath.\" Nu‘mán, it is said, immediately resolved to abandon his\r\nkingdom; on the same night he clad himself in sackcloth, stole away\r\nunperceived, and became a wandering devotee (_sá’iḥ_). This legend\r\nseems to have grown out of the following verses by ‘Adí b. Zayd, the\r\n‘Ibádite:--\r\n\r\n \"Consider thou Khawarnaq's lord--and oft\r\n  Of heavenly guidance cometh vision clear--\r\n  Who once, rejoicing in his ample realm,\r\n  Surveyed the broad Euphrates, and Sadír;[85]\r\n  Then sudden terror struck his heart: he cried,\r\n  'Shall Man, who deathward goes, find pleasure here?'\r\n  They reigned, they prospered; yet, their glory past,\r\n  In yonder tombs they lie this many a year.\r\n  At last they were like unto withered leaves\r\n  Whirled by the winds away in wild career.\"[86]\r\n\r\nThe opinion of most Arabian authors, that Nu‘mán embraced Christianity,\r\nis probably unfounded, but there is reason to believe that he was well\r\ndisposed towards it, and that his Christian subjects--a Bishop of\r\nḤíra is mentioned as early as 410 A.D.--enjoyed complete religious\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mundhir I.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mundhir III, b. Má’ al-samá.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Kinda.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mazdak.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mundhir expelled from Ḥíra by Ḥárith of Kinda.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Mundhir III.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mundhir's \"Good Day and Evil Day.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥanẓala and Sharík.]\r\n\r\nNu‘mán's place was filled by his son Mundhir, an able and energetic\r\nprince. The power of the Lakhmites at this time may be inferred from the\r\nfact that on the death of Yazdigird I Mundhir forcibly intervened in the\r\ndispute as to the Persian succession and procured the election of Bahrám\r\nGór, whose claims had previously been rejected by the priesthood.[87] In\r\nthe war which broke out shortly afterwards between Persia and Rome,\r\nMundhir proved himself a loyal vassal, but was defeated by the Romans\r\nwith great loss (421 A.D.). Passing over several obscure reigns, we\r\narrive at the beginning of the sixth century, when another Mundhir, the\r\nthird and most illustrious of his name, ascended the throne. This is he\r\nwhom the Arabs called Mundhir b. Má’ al-samá.[88] He had a long and\r\nbrilliant reign, which, however, was temporarily clouded by an event\r\nthat cannot be understood without some reference to the general history\r\nof the period. About 480 A.D. the powerful tribe of Kinda, whose princes\r\nappear to have held much the same position under the Tubba‘s of Yemen as\r\nthe Lakhmites under the Persian monarchs, had extended their sway over\r\nthe greater part of Central and Northern Arabia. The moving spirit in\r\nthis conquest was Ḥujr, surnamed Akilu ’l-Murár, an ancestor of the\r\npoet Imru’u ’l-Qays. On his death the Kindite confederacy was broken up,\r\nbut towards the year 500 it was re-established for a brief space by his\r\ngrandson, Ḥárith b. ‘Amr, and became a formidable rival to the\r\nkingdoms of Ghassán and Ḥíra. Meanwhile, in Persia, the communistic\r\ndoctrines of Mazdak had obtained wide popularity among the lower\r\nclasses, and were finally adopted by King Kawádh himself.[89] Now, it is\r\ncertain that at some date between 505 and 529 Ḥárith b. ‘Amr, the\r\nKindite, invaded ‘Iráq, and drove Mundhir out of his kingdom; and it\r\nseems not impossible that, as many historians assert, the latter's\r\ndownfall was due to his anti-Mazdakite opinions, which would naturally\r\nexcite the displeasure of his suzerain. At any rate, whatever the causes\r\nmay have been, Mundhir was temporarily supplanted by Ḥárith, and\r\nalthough he was restored after a short interval, before the accession of\r\nAnúshirwán, who, as Crown Prince, carried out a wholesale massacre of\r\nthe followers of Mazdak (528 A.D.), the humiliation which he had\r\nsuffered and cruelly avenged was not soon forgotten;[90] the life and\r\npoems of Imru’u ’l-Qays bear witness to the hereditary hatred subsisting\r\nbetween Lakhm and Kinda. Mundhir's operations against the Romans were\r\nconducted with extraordinary vigour; he devastated Syria as far as\r\nAntioch, and Justinian saw himself obliged to entrust the defence of\r\nthese provinces to the Ghassánid Ḥárith b. Jabala (Ḥárith\r\nal-A‘raj), in whom Mundhir at last found more than his match. From this\r\ntime onward the kings of Ḥíra and Ghassán are continually raiding and\r\nplundering each other's territory. In one of his expeditions Mundhir\r\ncaptured a son of Ḥárith, and \"immediately sacrificed him to\r\nAphrodite\"--_i.e._, to the Arabian goddess al-‘Uzzá;[91]--but on taking\r\nthe field again in 554 he was surprised and slain by stratagem in a\r\nbattle which is known proverbially as 'The Day of Ḥalíma.'[92] On the\r\nwhole, the Lakhmites were a heathen and barbarous race, and these\r\nepithets are richly deserved by Mundhir III. It is related in the\r\n_Aghání_ that he had two boon-companions, Khálid b. al-Muḍallil and\r\n‘Amr b. Mas‘úd, with whom he used to carouse; and once, being irritated\r\nby words spoken in wine, he gave orders that they should be buried\r\nalive. Next morning he did not recollect what had passed and inquired as\r\nusual for his friends. On learning the truth he was filled with remorse.\r\nHe caused two obelisks to be erected over their graves, and two days in\r\nevery year he would come and sit beside these obelisks, which were\r\ncalled _al-Ghariyyán_--_i.e._, the Blood-smeared. One day was the Day of\r\nGood (_yawmu na‘imin_), and whoever first encountered him on that day\r\nreceived a hundred black camels. The other day was the Day of Evil\r\n(_yawmu bu’sin_), on which he would present the first-comer with the\r\nhead of a black polecat (_ẓaribán_), then sacrifice him and smear the\r\nobelisks with his blood.[93] The poet ‘Abíd b. al-Abraṣ is said to\r\nhave fallen a victim to this horrible rite. It continued until the doom\r\nfell upon a certain Ḥanẓala of Ṭayyi’, who was granted a year's\r\ngrace in order to regulate his affairs, on condition that he should find\r\na surety. He appealed to one of Mundhir's suite, Sharík b. ‘Amr, who\r\nstraightway rose and said to the king, \"My hand for his and my blood for\r\nhis if he fail to return at the time appointed.\" When the day came\r\nḤanẓala did not appear, and Mundhir was about to sacrifice Sharík,\r\nwhose mourning-woman had already begun to chant the dirge. Suddenly a\r\nrider was seen approaching, wrapped in a shroud and perfumed for burial.\r\nA mourning-woman accompanied him. It was Ḥanẓala. Mundhir\r\nmarvelled at their loyalty, dismissed them with marks of honour, and\r\nabolished the custom which he had instituted.[94]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Amr B. Hind (554-569 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his son ‘Amr, who is known to contemporary poets and\r\nlater historians as ‘Amr, son of Hind.[95] During his reign Ḥíra\r\nbecame an important literary centre. Most of the famous poets then\r\nliving visited his court; we shall see in the next chapter what\r\nrelations he had with Ṭarafa, ‘Amr b. Kulthúm, and Ḥárith b.\r\nḤilliza. He was a morose, passionate, and tyrannical man. The Arabs\r\nstood in great awe of him, but vented their spite none the less. \"At\r\nḤíra,\" said Daháb al-‘Ijlí, \"there are mosquitoes and fever and lions\r\nand ‘Amr b. Hind, who acts unjustly and wrongfully.\"[96] He was slain by\r\nthe chief of Taghlib, ‘Amr b. Kulthúm, in vengeance for an insult\r\noffered to his mother, Laylá.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nu‘mán Abú Qábús.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Adí b. Zayd.]\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to mention the names of Qábús and Mundhir IV, both of\r\nwhom were sons of Hind, and occupied the throne for short periods. We\r\nnow come to the last Lakhmite king of Ḥíra, and by far the most\r\ncelebrated in tradition, Nu‘mán III, son of Mundhir IV, with the _kunya_\r\n(name of honour) Abú Qábús, who reigned from 580 to 602 or from 585 to\r\n607. He was brought up and educated by a noble Christian family in\r\nḤíra, the head of which was Zayd b. Ḥammád, father of the poet\r\n‘Adí b. Zayd. ‘Adí is such an interesting figure, and his fortunes were\r\nso closely and tragically linked with those of Nu‘mán, that some account\r\nof his life and character will be acceptable. Both his father and\r\ngrandfather were men of unusual culture, who held high posts in the\r\ncivil administration under Mundhir III and his successors. Zayd,\r\nmoreover, through the good offices of a _dihqán_, or Persian landed\r\nproprietor, Farrukh-máhán by name, obtained from Khusraw Anúshirwán an\r\nimportant and confidential appointment--that of Postmaster--ordinarily\r\nreserved for the sons of satraps.[97] When ‘Adí grew up, his father sent\r\nhim to be educated with the son of the _dihqán_. He learned to write and\r\nspeak Persian with complete facility and Arabic with the utmost\r\nelegance; he versified, and his accomplishments included archery,\r\nhorsemanship, and polo. At the Persian court his personal beauty, wit,\r\nand readiness in reply so impressed Anúshirwán that he took him into his\r\nservice as secretary and interpreter--Arabic had never before been\r\nwritten in the Imperial Chancery--and accorded him all the privileges of\r\na favourite. He was entrusted with a mission to Constantinople, where he\r\nwas honourably received; and on his departure the Qayṣar,[98]\r\nfollowing an excellent custom, instructed the officials in charge of the\r\npost-routes to provide horses and every convenience in order that the\r\nambassador might see for himself the extent and resources of the\r\nByzantine Empire. ‘Adí passed some time in Syria, especially at\r\nDamascus, where his first poem is said to have appeared. On his father's\r\ndeath, which happened about this time, he renounced the splendid\r\nposition at Ḥíra which he might have had for the asking, and gave\r\nhimself up to hunting and to all kinds of amusement and pleasure, only\r\nvisiting Madá’in (Ctesiphon) at intervals to perform his secretarial\r\nduties. While staying at Ḥíra he fell in love with Nu‘mán's daughter\r\nHind, who was then eleven years old. The story as told in the _Book of\r\nSongs_ is too curious to be entirely omitted, though want of space\r\nprevents me from giving it in full.[99]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: ‘Adí meets the Princess Hind in church.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: His marriage to Hind.]\r\n\r\n  It is related that Hind, who was one of the fairest women of her\r\n  time, went to church on Thursday of Holy Week, three days after Palm\r\n  Sunday, to receive the sacrament. ‘Adí had entered the church for\r\n  the same purpose. He espied her--she was a big, tall girl--while she\r\n  was off her guard, and fixed his gaze upon her before she became\r\n  aware of him. Her maidens, who had seen him approaching, said\r\n  nothing to their mistress, because one of them called Máriya was\r\n  enamoured of ‘Adí and knew no other way of making his acquaintance.\r\n  When Hind saw him looking at herself, she was highly displeased and\r\n  scolded her handmaidens and beat some of them. ‘Adí had fallen in\r\n  love with her, but he kept the matter secret for a whole year. At\r\n  the end of that time Máriya, thinking that Hind had forgotten what\r\n  passed, described the church of Thómá (St. Thomas) and the nuns\r\n  there and the girls who frequented it, and the beauty of the\r\n  building and of the lamps, and said to her, \"Ask thy mother's leave\r\n  to go.\" As soon as leave was granted, Máriya conveyed the\r\n  intelligence to ‘Adí, who immediately dressed himself in a\r\n  magnificent gold-embroidered Persian tunic (_yalmaq_) and hastened\r\n  to the rendezvous, accompanied by several young men of Ḥíra. When\r\n  Máriya perceived him, she cried to Hind, \"Look at this youth: by\r\n  God, he is fairer than the lamps and all things else that thou\r\n  seest.\" \"Who is he?\" she asked. \"‘Adí, son of Zayd.\" \"Do you think,\"\r\n  said Hind, \"that he will recognise me if I come nearer?\" Then she\r\n  advanced and watched him as he conversed with his friends,\r\n  outshining them all by the beauty of his person, the elegance of his\r\n  language, and the splendour of his dress. \"Speak to him,\" said\r\n  Máriya to her young mistress, whose countenance betrayed her\r\n  feelings. After exchanging a few words the lovers parted. Máriya\r\n  went to ‘Adí and promised, if he would first gratify her wishes, to\r\n  bring about his union with Hind. She lost no time in warning Nu‘mán\r\n  that his daughter was desperately in love with ‘Adí and would either\r\n  disgrace herself or die of grief unless he gave her to him. Nu‘mán,\r\n  however, was too proud to make overtures to ‘Adí, who on his part\r\n  feared to anger the prince by proposing an alliance. The ingenious\r\n  Máriya found a way out of the difficulty. She suggested that ‘Adí\r\n  should invite Nu‘mán and his suite to a banquet, and having well\r\n  plied him with wine should ask for the hand of his daughter, which\r\n  would not then be refused. So it came to pass. Nu‘mán gave his\r\n  consent to the marriage, and after three days Hind was brought home\r\n  to her husband.[100]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Adí secures the election of Nu‘mán as King of Ḥíra.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is imprisoned and put to death by Nu‘mán.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Mundhir IV ‘Adí warmly supported the claims of Nu‘mán,\r\nwho had formerly been his pupil and was now his father-in-law, to the\r\nthrone of Ḥíra. The ruse which he employed on this occasion was\r\ncompletely successful, but it cost him his life.[101] The partisans of\r\nAswad b. Mundhir, one of the defeated candidates, resolved on vengeance.\r\nTheir intrigues awakened the suspicions of Nu‘mán against the\r\n'King-maker.' ‘Adí was cast into prison, where he languished for a long\r\ntime and was finally murdered by Nu‘mán when the Chosroes (Parwéz, son\r\nof Hurmuz) had already intervened to procure his release.[102]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vengeance of Zayd b. ‘Adí.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Nu‘mán III.]\r\n\r\n‘Adí left a son named Zayd, who, on the recommendation of Nu‘mán, was\r\nappointed by Khusraw Parwéz to succeed his father as Secretary for\r\nArabian Affairs at the court of Ctesiphon. Apparently reconciled to\r\nNu‘mán, he was none the less bent on vengeance, and only waited for an\r\nopportunity. The kings of Persia were connoisseurs in female beauty, and\r\nwhen they desired to replenish their harems they used to circulate an\r\nadvertisement describing with extreme particularity the physical and\r\nmoral qualities which were to be sought after;[103] but hitherto they\r\nhad neglected Arabia, which, as they supposed, could not furnish any\r\nwoman possessed of these perfections. Zayd therefore approached the\r\nChosroes and said: \"I know that Nu‘mán has in his family a number of\r\nwomen answering to the description. Let me go to him, and send with me\r\none of thy guardsmen who understands Arabic.\" The Chosroes complied, and\r\nZayd set out for Ḥíra. On learning the object of his mission, Nu‘mán\r\nexclaimed with indignation: \"What! are not the gazelles of Persia\r\nsufficient for your needs?\" The comparison of a beautiful woman to a\r\ngazelle is a commonplace in Arabian poetry, but the officer accompanying\r\nZayd was ill acquainted with Arabic, and asked the meaning of the word\r\n(_‘ín_ or _mahá_) which Nu‘mán had employed. \"Cows,\" said Zayd. When\r\nParwéz heard from his guardsman that Nu‘mán had said, \"Do not the cows\r\nof Persia content him?\" he could scarcely suppress his rage. Soon\r\nafterwards he sent for Nu‘mán, threw him into chains, and caused him to\r\nbe trampled to pieces by elephants.[104]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Nu‘mán III.]\r\n\r\nNu‘mán III appears in tradition as a tyrannical prince, devoted to wine,\r\nwomen, and song. He was the patron of many celebrated poets, and\r\nespecially of Nábigha Dhubyání, who was driven from Ḥíra in\r\nconsequence of a false accusation. This episode, as well as another in\r\nwhich the poet Munakhkhal was concerned, gives us a glimpse into the\r\nprivate life of Nu‘mán. He had married his step-mother, Mutajarrida, a\r\ngreat beauty in her time; but though he loved her passionately, she\r\nbestowed her affections elsewhere. Nábigha was suspected on account of a\r\npoem in which he described the charms of the queen with the utmost\r\nminuteness, but Munakhkhal was the real culprit. The lovers were\r\nsurprised by Nu‘mán, and from that day Munakhkhal was never seen again.\r\nHence the proverb, \"Until Munakhkhal shall return,\" or, as we might say,\r\n\"Until the coming of the Coqcigrues.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nu‘mán's conversion to Christianity.]\r\n\r\nAlthough several of the kings of Ḥíra are said to have been\r\nChristians, it is very doubtful whether any except Nu‘mán III deserved\r\neven the name; the Lakhmites, unlike the majority of their subjects,\r\nwere thoroughly pagan. Nu‘mán's education would naturally predispose him\r\nto Christianity, and his conversion may have been wrought, as the legend\r\nasserts, by his mentor ‘Adí b. Zayd.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ghassánids or Jafnites.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Muḥammadan genealogists, the Ghassánids, both those\r\nsettled in Medína and those to whom the name is consecrated by popular\r\nusage--the Ghassánids of Syria--are descended from ‘Amr b. ‘Ámir\r\nal-Muzayqiyá, who, as was related in the last chapter, sold his\r\npossessions in Yemen and quitted the country, taking with him a great\r\nnumber of its inhabitants, shortly before the Bursting of the Dyke of\r\nMa’rib. His son Jafna is generally regarded as the founder of the\r\ndynasty. Of their early history very few authentic facts have been\r\npreserved. At first, we are told, they paid tribute to the Ḑajá‘ima,\r\na family of the stock of Salíḥ, who ruled the Syrian borderlands\r\nunder Roman protection. A struggle ensued, from which the Ghassánids\r\nemerged victorious, and henceforth we find them established in these\r\nregions as the representatives of Roman authority with the official\r\ntitles of Patricius and Phylarch, which they and the Arabs around them\r\nrendered after the simple Oriental fashion by 'King' (_malik_).\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ibn Qutayba's account of the Ghassánids.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ḥárith the Lame.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Jabala b. al-Ayham.]\r\n\r\n  The first (says Ibn Qutayba) that reigned in Syria of the family of\r\n  Jafna was Ḥárith b. ‘Amr Muḥarriq, who was so called because\r\n  he burnt (_ḥarraqa_) the Arabs in their houses. He is Ḥárith\r\n  the Elder (al-Akbar), and his name of honour (_kunya_) is Abú\r\n  Shamir. After him reigned Ḥárith b. Abí Shamir, known as\r\n  Ḥárith the Lame (_al-A‘raj_), whose mother was Máriya of the\r\n  Ear-rings. He was the best of their kings, and the most fortunate,\r\n  and the craftiest; and in his raids he went the farthest afield. He\r\n  led an expedition against Khaybar[105] and carried off a number of\r\n  prisoners, but set them free after his return to Syria. When Mundhir\r\n  b. Má’ al-samá marched against him with an army 100,000 strong,\r\n  Ḥárith sent a hundred men to meet him--among them the poet Labíd,\r\n  who was then a youth--ostensibly to make peace. They surrounded\r\n  Mundhir's tent and slew the king and his companions; then they took\r\n  horse, and some escaped, while others were slain. The Ghassánid\r\n  cavalry attacked the army of Mundhir and put them to flight.\r\n  Ḥárith had a daughter named Ḥalíma, who perfumed the hundred\r\n  champions on that day and clad them in shrouds of white linen and\r\n  coats of mail. She is the heroine of the proverb, \"The day of\r\n  Ḥalíma is no secret.\"[106] Ḥárith was succeeded by his son,\r\n  Ḥárith the Younger. Among his other sons were ‘Amr b. Ḥárith\r\n  (called Abú Shamir the Younger), to whom Nábigha came on leaving\r\n  Nu‘mán b. Mundhir; Mundhir b. Ḥárith; and al-Ayham b. Ḥárith.\r\n  Jabala, the son of al-Ayham, was the last of the kings of Ghassán.\r\n  He was twelve spans in height, and his feet brushed the ground when\r\n  he rode on horseback. He reached the Islamic period and became a\r\n  Moslem in the Caliphate of ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭáb, but afterwards\r\n  he turned Christian and went to live in the Byzantine Empire. The\r\n  occasion of his turning Christian was this: In passing through the\r\n  bazaar of Damascus he let his horse tread upon one of the\r\n  bystanders, who sprang up and struck Jabala a blow on the face. The\r\n  Ghassánís seized the fellow and brought him before Abú ‘Ubayda b.\r\n  al-Jarráḥ,[107] complaining that he had struck their master. Abú\r\n  ‘Ubayda demanded proof. \"What use wilt thou make of the proof?\" said\r\n  Jabala. He answered: \"If he has struck thee, thou wilt strike him a\r\n  blow in return.\" \"And shall not he be slain?\" \"No.\" \"Shall not his\r\n  hand be cut off?\" \"No,\" said Abú ‘Ubayda; \"God has ordained\r\n  retaliation only--blow for blow.\" Then Jabala went forth and betook\r\n  himself to Roman territory and became a Christian; and he stayed\r\n  there all the rest of his life.[108]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥárith the Lame.]\r\n\r\nThe Arabian traditions respecting the dynasty of Ghassán are hopelessly\r\nconfused and supply hardly any material even for the rough historical\r\nsketch which may be pieced together from the scattered notices in\r\nByzantine authors.[109] It would seem that the first unquestionable\r\nGhassánid prince was Ḥárith b. Jabala (Ἀρέθας τοῦ Γαβάλα), who\r\nfigures in Arabian chronicles as 'Ḥárith the Lame,' and who was\r\nappointed by Justinian (about 529 A.D.) to balance, on the Roman side,\r\nthe active and enterprising King of Ḥíra, Mundhir b. Má’ al-samá.\r\nDuring the greater part of his long reign (529-569 A.D.) he was engaged\r\nin war with this dangerous rival, to whose defeat and death in the\r\ndecisive battle of Ḥalíma we have already referred. Like all his\r\nline, Ḥárith was a Christian of the Monophysite Church, which he\r\ndefended with equal zeal and success at a time when its very existence\r\nwas at stake. The following story illustrates his formidable character.\r\nTowards the end of his life he visited Constantinople to arrange with\r\nthe Imperial Government which of his sons should succeed him, and made a\r\npowerful impression on the people of that city, especially on the\r\nEmperor's nephew, Justinus. Many years afterwards, when Justinus had\r\nfallen into dotage, the chamberlains would frighten him, when he began\r\nto rave, with \"Hush! Arethas will come and take you.\"[110]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mundhir b. Ḥárith.]\r\n\r\nḤárith was succeeded by his son, Mundhir, who vanquished the new King\r\nof Ḥíra, Qábús b. Hind, on Ascension Day, 570 A.D., in a battle which\r\nis perhaps identical with that celebrated by the Arabs as the Battle of\r\n‘Ayn Ubágh. The refusal of the Emperor Justinus to furnish him with\r\nmoney may have prevented Mundhir from pursuing his advantage, and was\r\nthe beginning of open hostility between them, which culminated about\r\neleven years later in his being carried off to Constantinople and forced\r\nto reside in Sicily.\r\n\r\nFrom this time to the Persian conquest of Palestine (614 A.D.) anarchy\r\nprevailed throughout the Ghassánid kingdom. The various tribes elected\r\ntheir own princes, who sometimes, no doubt, were Jafnites; but the\r\ndynasty had virtually broken up. Possibly it was restored by Heraclius\r\nwhen he drove the Persians out of Syria (629 A.D.), as the Ghassánians\r\nare repeatedly found fighting for Rome against the Moslems, and\r\naccording to the unanimous testimony of Arabian writers, the Jafnite\r\nJabala b. al-Ayham, who took an active part in the struggle, was the\r\nlast king of Ghassán. His accession may be placed about 635 A.D. The\r\npoet Ḥassán b. Thábit, who as a native of Medína could claim kinship\r\nwith the Ghassánids, and visited their court in his youth, gives a\r\nglowing description of its luxury and magnificence.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ḥassán b. Thábit's picture of the Ghassánid court.]\r\n\r\n  \"I have seen ten singing-girls, five of them Greeks, singing Greek\r\n  songs to the music of lutes, and five from Ḥíra who had been\r\n  presented to King Jabala by Iyás b. Qabíṣa,[111] chanting\r\n  Babylonian airs. Arab singers used to come from Mecca and elsewhere\r\n  for his delight; and when he would drink wine he sat on a couch of\r\n  myrtle and jasmine and all sorts of sweet-smelling flowers,\r\n  surrounded by gold and silver vessels full of ambergris and musk.\r\n  During winter aloes-wood was burned in his apartments, while in\r\n  summer he cooled himself with snow. Both he and his courtiers wore\r\n  light robes, arranged with more regard to comfort than\r\n  ceremony,[112] in the hot weather, and white furs, called\r\n  _fanak_,[113] or the like, in the cold season; and, by God, I was\r\n  never in his company but he gave me the robe which he was wearing on\r\n  that day, and many of his friends were thus honoured. He treated the\r\n  rude with forbearance; he laughed without reserve and lavished his\r\n  gifts before they were sought. He was handsome, and agreeable in\r\n  conversation: I never knew him offend in speech or act.\"[114]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ghassánid civilisation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nábigha's encomium.]\r\n\r\nUnlike the rival dynasty on the Euphrates, the Ghassánids had no fixed\r\nresidence. They ruled the country round Damascus and Palmyra, but these\r\nplaces were never in their possession. The capital of their nomad\r\nkingdom was the temporary camp (in Aramaic, _ḥértá_) which followed\r\nthem to and fro, but was generally to be found in the Gaulonitis\r\n(al-Jawlán), south of Damascus. Thus under the quickening impulse of\r\nHellenistic culture the Ghassánids developed a civilisation far superior\r\nto that of the Lakhmites, who, just because of their half-barbarian\r\ncharacter, were more closely in touch with the heathen Arabs, and\r\nexercised a deeper influence upon them. Some aspects of this\r\ncivilisation have been indicated in the description of Jabala b.\r\nal-Ayham's court, attributed to the poet Ḥassán. An earlier bard, the\r\nfamous Nábigha, having fallen out of favour with Nu‘mán III of Híra,\r\nfled to Syria, where he composed a splendid eulogy of the Ghassánids in\r\nhonour of his patron, King ‘Amr, son of Ḥárith the Lame. After\r\ncelebrating their warlike prowess, which he has immortalised in the\r\noft-quoted verse--\r\n\r\n \"One fault they have: their swords are blunt of edge\r\n  Through constant beating on their foemen's mail,\"\r\n\r\nhe concludes in a softer strain:\r\n\r\n \"Theirs is a liberal nature that God gave\r\n  To no men else; their virtues never fail.\r\n  Their home the Holy Land: their faith upright:\r\n  They hope to prosper if good deeds avail.\r\n  Zoned in fair wise and delicately shod,\r\n  They keep the Feast of Palms, when maidens pale,\r\n  Whose scarlet silken robes on trestles hang,\r\n  Greet them with odorous boughs and bid them hail.\r\n  Long lapped in ease tho' bred to war, their limbs\r\n  Green-shouldered vestments, white-sleeved, richly veil.\"[115]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Bedouin history.]\r\n\r\nThe Pre-islamic history of the Bedouins is mainly a record of wars, or\r\nrather guerillas, in which a great deal of raiding and plundering was\r\naccomplished, as a rule without serious bloodshed. There was no lack of\r\nshouting; volleys of vaunts and satires were exchanged; camels and women\r\nwere carried off; many skirmishes took place but few pitched battles: it\r\nwas an Homeric kind of warfare that called forth individual exertion in\r\nthe highest degree, and gave ample opportunity for single-handed deeds\r\nof heroism. \"To write a true history of such Bedouin feuds is well-nigh\r\nimpossible. As comparatively trustworthy sources of information we have\r\nonly the poems and fragments of verse which have been preserved.\r\nAccording to Suyúṭí, the Arabian traditionists used to demand from\r\nany Bedouin who related an historical event the citation of some verses\r\nin its support; and, in effect, all such stories that have come down to\r\nus are crystallised round the poems. Unfortunately these crystals are\r\nseldom pure. It appears only too often that the narratives have been\r\ninvented, with abundant fancy and with more or less skill, to suit the\r\ncontents of the verses.\"[116] But although what is traditionally related\r\nconcerning the Battle-days of the Arabs (_Ayyámu ’l-‘Arab_) is to a\r\nlarge extent legendary, it describes with sufficient fidelity how tribal\r\nhostilities generally arose and the way in which they were conducted.\r\nThe following account of the War of Basús--the most famous of those\r\nwaged in Pre-islamic times--will serve to illustrate this important\r\nphase of Bedouin life.[117]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War of Basús.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifth century A.D. Kulayb, son of Rabí‘a, was\r\nchieftain of the Banú Taghlib, a powerful tribe which divided with their\r\nkinsmen, the Banú Bakr, a vast tract in north-eastern Arabia, extending\r\nfrom the central highlands to the Syrian desert. His victory at the head\r\nof a confederacy formed by these tribes and others over the Yemenite\r\nArabs made him the first man in the peninsula, and soon his pride became\r\nno less proverbial than his power.[118] He was married to Ḥalíla,\r\ndaughter of Murra, of the Banú Bakr, and dwelt in a 'preserve'\r\n(_ḥimá_), where he claimed the sole right of pasturage for himself\r\nand the sons of Murra. His brother-in-law, Jassás, had an aunt named\r\nBasús. While living under her nephew's protection she was joined by a\r\ncertain Sa‘d, a client of her own people, who brought with him a\r\nshe-camel called Sarábi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kulayb b. Rabí‘a and Jassás b. Murra.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The wounding of Sa‘d's she-camel.]\r\n\r\nNow it happened that Kulayb, seeing a lark's nest as he walked on his\r\nland, said to the bird, which was screaming and fluttering distressfully\r\nover her eggs, \"Have no fear! I will protect thee.\" But a short time\r\nafterwards he observed in that place the track of a strange camel and\r\nfound the eggs trodden to pieces. Next morning when he and Jassás\r\nvisited the pasture ground, Kulayb noticed the she-camel of Sa‘d among\r\nhis brother-in-law's herd, and conjecturing that she had destroyed the\r\neggs, cried out to Jassás, \"Take heed thou! Take heed! I have pondered\r\nsomething, and were I sure, I would have done it! May this she-camel\r\nnever come here again with this herd!\" \"By God,\" exclaimed Jassás, \"but\r\nshe shall come!\" and when Kulayb threatened to pierce her udder with an\r\narrow, Jassás retorted, \"By the stones of Wá’il,[119] fix thine arrow in\r\nher udder and I will fix my lance in thy backbone!\" Then he drove his\r\ncamels forth from the _ḥimá_. Kulayb went home in a passion, and said\r\nto his wife, who sought to discover what ailed him, \"Knowest thou any\r\none who durst defend his client against me?\" She answered, \"No one\r\nexcept my brother Jassás, if he has given his word.\" She did what she\r\ncould to prevent the quarrel going further, and for a time nothing worse\r\nthan taunts passed between them, until one day Kulayb went to look after\r\nhis camels which were being taken to water, and were followed by those\r\nof Jassás. While the latter were waiting their turn to drink, Sa‘d's\r\nshe-camel broke loose and ran towards the water. Kulayb imagined that\r\nJassás had let her go deliberately, and resenting the supposed insult,\r\nhe seized his bow and shot her through the udder. The beast lay down,\r\nmoaning loudly, before the tent of Basús, who in vehement indignation at\r\nthe wrong suffered by her friend, Sa‘d, tore the veil from her head,\r\nbeating her face and crying, \"O shame, shame!\" Then, addressing Sa‘d,\r\nbut raising her voice so that Jassás might hear, she spoke these verses,\r\nwhich are known as 'The Instigators' (_al-Muwaththibát_):--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Verses spoken by Basús.]\r\n\r\n \"_O Sa‘d, be not deceived! Protect thyself!\r\n   This people for their clients have no care.\r\n   Look to my herds, I charge thee, for I doubt\r\n   Even my little daughters ill may fare.\r\n   By thy life, had I been in Minqar's house,\r\n   Thou would'st not have been wronged, my client, there!\r\n   But now such folk I dwell among that when\r\n   The wolf comes, 'tis my sheep he comes to tear!_\"[120]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kulayb murdered by Jassás.]\r\n\r\nJassás was stung to the quick by the imputation, which no Arab can\r\nendure, that injury and insult might be inflicted upon his guest-friend\r\nwith impunity. Some days afterwards, having ascertained that Kulayb had\r\ngone out unarmed, he followed and slew him, and fled in haste to his own\r\npeople. Murra, when he heard the news, said to his son, \"Thou alone must\r\nanswer for thy deed: thou shalt be put in chains that his kinsmen may\r\nslay thee. By the stones of Wá’il, never will Bakr and Taghlib be joined\r\ntogether in welfare after the death of Kulayb. Verily, an evil thing\r\nhast thou brought upon thy people, O Jassás! Thou hast slain their chief\r\nand severed their union and cast war into their midst.\" So he put Jassás\r\nin chains and confined him in a tent; then he summoned the elders of the\r\nfamilies and asked them, \"What do ye say concerning Jassás? Here he is,\r\na prisoner, until the avengers demand him and we deliver him unto them.\"\r\n\"No, by God,\" cried Sa‘d b. Málik b. Ḑubay‘a b. Qays, \"we will not\r\ngive him up, but will fight for him to the last man!\" With these words\r\nhe called for a camel to be sacrificed, and when its throat was cut they\r\nswore to one another over the blood. Thereupon Murra said to Jassás:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Verses of Murra, the father of Jassás.]\r\n\r\n \"_If war thou hast wrought and brought on me,\r\n   No laggard I with arms outworn.\r\n   Whate'er befall, I make to flow\r\n   The baneful cups of death at morn._\r\n\r\n   _When spear-points clash, my wounded man\r\n   Is forced to drag the spear he stained.\r\n   Never I reck, if war must be,\r\n   What Destiny hath preordained._\r\n\r\n   _Donning war's harness, I will strive\r\n   To fend from me the shame that sears.\r\n   Already I thrill and my lust is roused\r\n   For the shock of the horsemen against the spears!_\"[121]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outbreak of war between Taghlib and Bakr.]\r\n\r\nThus began the War of Basús between Taghlib on the one side and the clan\r\nof Shaybán, to which Murra belonged, on the other; for at first the\r\nremaining divisions of Bakr held aloof from the struggle, considering\r\nShaybán to be clearly in the wrong. The latter were reduced to dire\r\nstraits, when an event occurred which caused the Bakrites to rise as one\r\nman on behalf of their fellows. Ḥárith b.‘Ubád, a famous knight of\r\nBakr, had refused to take part in the contest, saying in words which\r\nbecame proverbial, \"I have neither camel nor she-camel in it,\" _i.e._,\r\n\"it is no affair of mine.\" One day his nephew, Bujayr, encountered\r\nKulayb's brother, Muhalhil, on whom the mantle of the murdered chief had\r\nfallen; and Muhalhil, struck with admiration for the youth's comeliness,\r\nasked him who he was. \"Bujayr,\" said he, \"the son of ‘Amr, the son of\r\n‘Ubád.\" \"And who is thy uncle on the mother's side?\" \"My mother is a\r\ncaptive\" (for he would not name an uncle of whom he had no honour). Then\r\nMuhalhil slew him, crying, \"Pay for Kulayb's shoe-latchet!\" On hearing\r\nthis, Ḥárith sent a message to Muhalhil in which he declared that if\r\nvengeance were satisfied by the death of Bujayr, he for his part would\r\ngladly acquiesce. But Muhalhil replied, \"I have taken satisfaction only\r\nfor Kulayb's shoe-latchet.\" Thereupon Ḥárith sprang up in wrath and\r\ncried:--\r\n\r\n \"_God knows, I kindled not this fire, altho'\r\n     I am burned in it to-day.\r\n   A lord for a shoe-latchet is too dear:\r\n     To horse! To horse! Away!_\"[122]\r\n\r\nAnd al-Find, of the Banú Bakr, said on this occasion:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Verses by al-Find.]\r\n\r\n \"_We spared the Banú Hind[123] and said, 'Our brothers they remain:\r\n   It may be Time will make of us one people yet again.'_\"\r\n  _But when the wrong grew manifest, and naked Ill stood plain,\r\n   And naught was left but ruthless hate, we paid them bane with bane!\r\n   As lions marched we forth to war in wrath and high disdain:\r\n   Our swords brought widowhood and tears and wailing in their train,\r\n   Our spears dealt gashes wide whence blood like water spilled amain.\r\n   No way but Force to weaken Force and mastery obtain;\r\n  'Tis wooing contumely to meet wild actions with humane:\r\n   By evil thou may'st win to peace when good is tried in vain._\"[124]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Day of Shearing.]\r\n\r\nThe Banú Bakr now prepared for a decisive battle. As their enemy had the\r\nadvantage in numbers, they adopted a stratagem devised by Ḥárith.\r\n\"Fight them,\" said he, \"with your women. Equip every woman with a small\r\nwaterskin and give her a club. Place the whole body of them behind\r\nyou--this will make you more resolved in battle--and wear some\r\ndistinguishing mark which they will recognise, so that when a woman\r\npasses by one of your wounded she may know him by his mark and give him\r\nwater to drink, and raise him from the ground; but when she passes by\r\none of your foes she will smite him with her club and slay him.\" So the\r\nBakrites shaved their heads, devoting themselves to death, and made this\r\na mark of recognition between themselves and their women, and this day\r\nwas called the Day of Shearing. Now Jaḥdar b. Ḑubay‘a was an\r\nill-favoured, dwarfish man, with fair flowing love-locks, and he said,\r\n\"O my people, if ye shave my head ye will disfigure me, so leave my\r\nlocks for the first horseman of Taghlib that shall emerge from the\r\nhill-pass on the morrow\" (meaning \"I will answer for him, if my locks\r\nare spared\"). On his request being granted, he exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The vow of Jaḥdar b. Ḑubay‘a.]\r\n\r\n \"_To wife and daughter\r\n     Henceforth I am dead:\r\n   Dust for ointment\r\n     On my hair is shed._\r\n\r\n  _Let me close with the horsemen\r\n     Who hither ride,\r\n   Cut my locks from me\r\n     If I stand aside!_\r\n\r\n  _Well wots a mother\r\n     If the son she bore\r\n   And swaddled on her bosom\r\n     And smelt him o'er,_\r\n\r\n  _Whenever warriors\r\n     In the mellay meet,\r\n   Is a puny weakling\r\n     Or a man complete!_\"[125]\r\n\r\nHe kept his promise but in the course of the fight he fell, severely\r\nwounded. When the women came to him, they saw his love-locks and\r\nimagining that he was an enemy despatched him with their clubs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Women as combatants.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of women on the field and the active share they took in the\r\ncombat naturally provoked the bitterest feelings. If they were not\r\nengaged in finishing the bloody work of the men, their tongues were busy\r\ninciting them. We are told that a daughter of al-Find bared herself\r\nrecklessly and chanted:--\r\n\r\n \"_War! War! War! War!\r\n   It has blazed up and scorched us sore.\r\n   The highlands are filled with its roar.\r\n   Well done, the morning when your heads ye shore!_\"[126]\r\n\r\nThe mothers were accompanied by their children, whose tender age did not\r\nalways protect them from an exasperated foe. It is related that a\r\nhorseman of the Banú Taghlib transfixed a young boy and lifted him up on\r\nthe point of his spear. He is said to have been urged to this act of\r\nsavagery by one al-Bazbáz, who was riding behind him on the crupper.\r\nTheir triumph was short; al-Find saw them, and with a single\r\nspear-thrust pinned them to each other--an exploit which his own verses\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nOn this day the Banú Bakr gained a great victory, and broke the power of\r\nTaghlib. It was the last battle of note in the Forty Years' War, which\r\nwas carried on, by raiding and plundering, until the exhaustion of both\r\ntribes and the influence of King Mundhir III of Ḥíra brought it to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War of Dáḥis and Ghabrá.]\r\n\r\nNot many years after the conclusion of peace between Bakr and Taghlib,\r\nanother war, hardly less famous in tradition than the War of Basús,\r\nbroke out in Central Arabia. The combatants were the tribes of ‘Abs and\r\nDhubyán, the principal stocks of the Banú Ghaṭafán, and the occasion\r\nof their coming to blows is related as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Qays, son of Zuhayr, was chieftain of ‘Abs. He had a horse called\r\n  Dáḥis, renowned for its speed, which he matched against Ghabrá, a\r\n  mare belonging to Ḥudhayfa b. Badr, the chief of Dhubyán. It was\r\n  agreed that the course should be a hundred bow-shots in length, and\r\n  that the victor should receive a hundred camels. When the race began\r\n  Ghabrá took the lead, but as they left the firm ground and entered\r\n  upon the sand, where the 'going' was heavy, Dáḥis gradually drew\r\n  level and passed his antagonist. He was nearing the goal when some\r\n  Dhubyánites sprang from an ambuscade prepared beforehand, and drove\r\n  him out of his course, thus enabling Ghabrá to defeat him. On being\r\n  informed of this foul play Qays naturally claimed that he had won\r\n  the wager, but the men of Dhubyán refused to pay even a single\r\n  camel. Bitterly resenting their treachery, he waylaid and slew one\r\n  of Ḥudhayfa's brothers. Ḥudhayfa sought vengeance, and the\r\n  murder of Málik, a brother of Qays, by his horsemen gave the signal\r\n  for war. In the fighting which ensued Dhubyán more than held their\r\n  own, but neither party could obtain a decisive advantage. Qays slew\r\n  the brothers Ḥudhayfa and Ḥamal--\r\n\r\n  \"_Ḥamal I slew and eased my heart thereby,\r\n    Ḥudhayfa glutted my avenging brand;\r\n    But though I slaked my thirst by slaying them,\r\n    I would as lief have lost my own right hand._\"[127]\r\n\r\n  After a long period--forty years according to the traditional\r\n  computation--‘Abs and Dhubyán were reconciled by the exertions of\r\n  two chieftains of the latter tribe, Ḥárith b. ‘Awf and Harim b.\r\n  Sinán, whose generous and patriotic intervention the poet Zuhayr has\r\n  celebrated. Qays went into exile. \"I will not look,\" he said, \"on\r\n  the face of any woman of Dhubyán whose father or brother or husband\r\n  or son I have killed.\" If we may believe the legend, he became a\r\n  Christian monk and ended his days in ‘Umán.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hijáz.]\r\n\r\nDescending westward from the highlands of Najd the traveller gradually\r\napproaches the Red Sea, which is separated from the mountains running\r\nparallel to it by a narrow strip of coast-land, called the Tiháma\r\n(Netherland). The rugged plateau between Najd and the coast forms the\r\nḤijáz (Barrier), through which in ancient times the Sabæan caravans\r\nladen with costly merchandise passed on their way to the Mediterranean\r\nports. Long before the beginning of our era two considerable trading\r\nsettlements had sprung up in this region, viz., Macoraba (Mecca) and,\r\nsome distance farther north, Yathrippa (Yathrib, the Pre-islamic name of\r\nMedína). Of their early inhabitants and history we know nothing except\r\nwhat is related by Muḥammadan writers, whose information reaches back\r\nto the days of Adam and Abraham. Mecca was the cradle of Islam, and\r\nIslam, according to Muḥammad, is the religion of Abraham, which was\r\ncorrupted by succeeding generations until he himself was sent to purify\r\nit and to preach it anew. Consequently the Pre-islamic history of Mecca\r\nhas all been, so to speak, 'Islamised.' The Holy City of Islam is made\r\nto appear in the same light thousands of years before the Prophet's\r\ntime: here, it is said, the Arabs were united in worship of Allah, hence\r\nthey scattered and fell into idolatry, hither they return annually as\r\npilgrims to a shrine which had been originally dedicated to the One\r\nSupreme Being, but which afterwards became a Pantheon of tribal deities.\r\nThis theory lies at the root of the Muḥammadan legend which I shall\r\nnow recount as briefly as possible, only touching on the salient points\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foundation of the Ka‘ba.]\r\n\r\nIn the Meccan valley--the primitive home of that portion of the Arab\r\nrace which claims descent from Ismá‘íl (Ishmael), the son of Ibráhím\r\n(Abraham) by Hájar (Hagar)--stands an irregular, cube-shaped building of\r\nsmall dimensions--the Ka‘ba. Legend attributes its foundation to Adam,\r\nwho built it by Divine command after a celestial archetype. At the\r\nDeluge it was taken up into heaven, but was rebuilt on its former site\r\nby Abraham and Ishmael. While they were occupied in this work Gabriel\r\nbrought the celebrated Black Stone, which is set in the southeast corner\r\nof the building, and he also instructed them in the ceremonies of the\r\nPilgrimage. When all was finished Abraham stood on a rock known to later\r\nages as the _Maqámu Ibráhím_, and, turning to the four quarters of the\r\nsky, made proclamation: \"O ye people! The Pilgrimage to the Ancient\r\nHouse is prescribed unto you. Hearken to your Lord!\" And from every part\r\nof the world came the answer: \"_Labbayka ’lláhumma, labbayka_\"--_i.e._,\r\n\"We obey, O God, we obey.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Idolatry introduced at Mecca.]\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Ishmael multiplied exceedingly, so that the barren\r\nvalley could no longer support them, and a great number wandered forth\r\nto other lands. They were succeeded as rulers of the sacred territory by\r\nthe tribe of Jurhum, who waxed in pride and evil-doing until the\r\nvengeance of God fell upon them. Mention has frequently been made of the\r\nBursting of the Dyke of Ma’rib, which caused an extensive movement of\r\nYemenite stocks to the north. The invaders halted in the Ḥijáz, and,\r\nhaving almost exterminated the Jurhumites, resumed their journey. One\r\ngroup, however--the Banú Khuzá‘a, led by their chief Luḥayy--settled\r\nin the neighbourhood of Mecca. ‘Amr, son of Luḥayy, was renowned\r\namong the Arabs for his wealth and generosity. Ibn Hishám says: 'I have\r\nbeen told by a learned man that ‘Amr b. Luḥayy went from Mecca to\r\nSyria on some business and when he arrived at Má’ab, in the land of\r\nal-Balqá, he found the inhabitants, who were ‘Amálíq, worshipping idols.\r\n\"What are these idols?\" he inquired. \"They are idols that send us rain\r\nwhen we ask them for rain, and help us when we ask them for help.\" \"Will\r\nye not give me one of them,\" said ‘Amr, \"that I may take it to Arabia to\r\nbe worshipped there?\" So they gave him an idol called Hubal, which he\r\nbrought to Mecca and set it up and bade the people worship and venerate\r\nit.'[128] Following his example, the Arabs brought their idols and\r\ninstalled them round the sanctuary. The triumph of Paganism was\r\ncomplete. We are told that hundreds of idols were destroyed by\r\nMuḥammad when he entered Mecca at the head of a Moslem army in 8 A.H.\r\n= 629 A.D.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Quraysh.]\r\n\r\nTo return to the posterity of Ismá‘íl through ‘Adnán: the principal of\r\ntheir descendants who remained in the Ḥijáz were the Hudhayl, the\r\nKinána, and the Quraysh. The last-named tribe must now engage our\r\nattention almost exclusively. During the century before Muḥammad we\r\nfind them in undisputed possession of Mecca and acknowledged guardians\r\nof the Ka‘ba--an office which they administered with a shrewd\r\nappreciation of its commercial value. Their rise to power is related as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The story of Quṣayy.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Quṣayy master of Mecca.]\r\n\r\n  Kiláb b. Murra, a man of Quraysh, had two sons, Zuhra and Zayd. The\r\n  latter was still a young child when his father died, and soon\r\n  afterwards his mother, Fáṭima, who had married again, left Mecca,\r\n  taking Zayd with her, and went to live in her new husband's home\r\n  beside the Syrian borders. Zayd grew up far from his native land,\r\n  and for this reason he got the name of Quṣayy--_i.e._, 'Little\r\n  Far-away.' When he reached man's estate and discovered his true\r\n  origin he returned to Mecca, where the hegemony was wholly in the\r\n  hands of the Khuzá‘ites under their chieftain, Ḥulayl b.\r\n  Ḥubshiyya, with the determination to procure the superintendence\r\n  of the Ka‘ba for his own people, the Quraysh, who as pure-blooded\r\n  descendants of Ismá‘íl had the best right to that honour. By his\r\n  marriage with Ḥubbá, the daughter of Ḥulayl, he hoped to\r\n  inherit the privileges vested in his father-in-law, but Ḥulayl on\r\n  his deathbed committed the keys of the Ka‘ba to a kinsman named Abú\r\n  Ghubshán. Not to be baffled, Quṣayy made the keeper drunk and\r\n  persuaded him to sell the keys for a skin of wine--hence the\r\n  proverbs \"A greater fool than Abú Ghubshán\" and \"Abú Ghubshán's\r\n  bargain,\" denoting a miserable fraud. Naturally the Khuza‘ites did\r\n  not acquiesce in the results of this transaction; they took up arms,\r\n  but Quṣayy was prepared for the struggle and won a decisive\r\n  victory. He was now master of Temple and Town and could proceed to\r\n  the work of organisation. His first step was to bring together the\r\n  Quraysh, who had previously been dispersed over a wide area, into\r\n  the Meccan valley--this earned for him the title of _al-Mujammi‘_\r\n  (the Congregator)--so that each family had its allotted quarter. He\r\n  built a House of Assembly (_Dáru ’l-Nadwa_), where matters affecting\r\n  the common weal were discussed by the Elders of the tribe. He also\r\n  instituted and centred in himself a number of dignities in\r\n  connection with the government of the Ka‘ba and the administration\r\n  of the Pilgrimage, besides others of a political and military\r\n  character. Such was his authority that after his death, no less than\r\n  during his life, all these ordinances were regarded by the Quraysh\r\n  as sacred and inviolable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mecca in the sixth century after Christ.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Quṣayy may be placed in the latter half of the fifth\r\ncentury. His descendant, the Prophet Muḥammad, was born about a\r\nhundred years afterwards, in 570 or 571 A.D. With one notable exception,\r\nto be mentioned immediately, the history of Mecca during the period thus\r\ndefined is a record of petty factions unbroken by any event of\r\nimportance. The Prophet's ancestors fill the stage and assume a\r\ncommanding position, which in all likelihood they never possessed; the\r\nhistorical rivalry of the Umayyads and ‘Abbásids appears in the persons\r\nof their founders, Umayya and Háshim--and so forth. Meanwhile the\r\ninfluence of the Quraysh was steadily maintained and extended. The Ka‘ba\r\nhad become a great national rendezvous, and the crowds of pilgrims which\r\nit attracted from almost every Arabian clan not only raised the credit\r\nof the Quraysh, but also materially contributed to their commercial\r\nprosperity. It has already been related how Abraha, the Abyssinian\r\nviceroy of Yemen, resolved to march against Mecca with the avowed\r\npurpose of avenging upon the Ka‘ba a sacrilege committed by one of the\r\nQuraysh in the church at Ṣan‘á. Something of that kind may have\r\nserved as a pretext, but no doubt his real aim was to conquer Mecca and\r\nto gain control of her trade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Year of the Elephant.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abyssinians at Mecca.]\r\n\r\nThis memorable expedition[129] is said by Moslem historians to have\r\ntaken place in the year of Muḥammad's birth (about 570 A.D.), usually\r\nknown as the Year of the Elephant--a proof that the Arabs were deeply\r\nimpressed by the extraordinary spectacle of these huge animals, one or\r\nmore of which accompanied the Abyssinian force. The report of Abraha's\r\npreparations filled the tribesmen with dismay. At first they endeavoured\r\nto oppose his march, regarding the defence of the Ka‘ba as a sacred\r\nduty, but they soon lost heart, and Abraha, after defeating Dhú Nafar, a\r\nḤimyarite chieftain, encamped in the neighbourhood of Mecca without\r\nfurther resistance. He sent the following message to ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Muṭṭalib, the Prophet's grandfather, who was at that time the\r\nmost influential personage in Mecca: \"I have not come to wage war on\r\nyou, but only to destroy the Temple. Unless you take up arms in its\r\ndefence, I have no wish to shed your blood.\" ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib\r\nreplied: \"By God, we seek not war, for which we are unable. This is\r\nGod's holy House and the House of Abraham, His Friend; it is for Him to\r\nprotect His House and Sanctuary; if He abandons it, we cannot defend\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib's interview with Abraha.]\r\n\r\n  Then ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib was conducted by the envoy to the\r\n  Abyssinian camp, as Abraha had ordered. There he inquired after Dhú\r\n  Nafar, who was his friend, and found him a prisoner. \"O Dhú Nafar,\"\r\n  said he, \"can you do aught in that which has befallen us?\" Dhú Nafar\r\n  answered, \"What can a man do who is a captive in the hands of a\r\n  king, expecting day and night to be put to death? I can do nothing\r\n  at all in the matter, but Unays, the elephant-driver, is my friend;\r\n  I will send to him and press your claims on his consideration and\r\n  ask him to procure you an audience with the king. Tell Unays what\r\n  you wish: he will plead with the king in your favour if he can.\" So\r\n  Dhú Nafar sent for Unays and said to him, \"O Unays, ‘Abdu\r\n  ’l-Muṭṭalib is lord of Quraysh and master of the caravans of\r\n  Mecca. He feeds the people in the plain and the wild creatures on\r\n  the mountain-tops. The king has seized two hundred of his camels.\r\n  Now get him admitted to the king's presence and help him to the best\r\n  of your power.\" Unays consented, and soon ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib\r\n  stood before the king. When Abraha saw him he held him in too high\r\n  respect to let him sit in an inferior place, but was unwilling that\r\n  the Abyssinians should see the Arab chief, who was a large man and a\r\n  comely, seated on a level with himself; he therefore descended from\r\n  his throne and sat on his carpet and bade ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib\r\n  sit beside him. Then he said to his dragoman, \"Ask him what he wants\r\n  of me.\" ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib replied, \"I want the king to restore\r\n  to me two hundred camels of mine which he has taken away.\" Abraha\r\n  said to the dragoman, \"Tell him: You pleased me when I first saw\r\n  you, but now that you have spoken to me I hold you cheap. What! do\r\n  you speak to me of two hundred camels which I have taken, and omit\r\n  to speak of a temple venerated by you and your fathers which I have\r\n  come to destroy?\" Then said ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib: \"The camels are\r\n  mine, but the Temple belongs to another, who will defend it,\" and on\r\n  the king exclaiming, \"He cannot defend it from me,\" he said, \"That\r\n  is your affair; only give me back my camels.\"\r\n\r\n  As it is related in a more credible version, the tribes settled\r\n  round Mecca sent ambassadors, of whom ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib was\r\n  one, offering to surrender a third part of their possessions to\r\n  Abraha on condition that he should spare the Temple, but he refused.\r\n  Having recovered his camels, ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib returned to the\r\n  Quraysh, told them what had happened, and bade them leave the city\r\n  and take shelter in the mountains. Then he went to the Ka‘ba,\r\n  accompanied by several of the Quraysh, to pray for help against\r\n  Abraha and his army. Grasping the ring of the door, he cried:--\r\n\r\n  \"_O God, defend Thy neighbouring folk even as a man his gear[130]\r\n      defendeth!\r\n    Let not their Cross and guileful plans defeat the plans Thyself\r\n      intendeth!\r\n    But if Thou make it so, 'tis well: according to Thy will it\r\n      endeth._\"[131]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Rout of the Abyssinians.]\r\n\r\n  Next morning, when Abraha prepared to enter Mecca, his elephant\r\n  knelt down and would not budge, though they beat its head with an\r\n  axe and thrust sharp stakes into its flanks; but when they turned it\r\n  in the direction of Yemen, it rose up and trotted with alacrity.\r\n  Then God sent from the sea a flock of birds like swallows every one\r\n  of which carried three stones as large as a chick-pea or a lentil,\r\n  one in its bill and one in each claw, and all who were struck by\r\n  those stones perished.[132] The rest fled in disorder, dropping down\r\n  as they ran or wherever they halted to quench their thirst. Abraha\r\n  himself was smitten with a plague so that his limbs rotted off\r\n  piecemeal.[133]\r\n\r\nThese details are founded on the 105th chapter of the Koran, entitled\r\n'The Súra of the Elephant,' which may be freely rendered as follows:--\r\n\r\n \"Hast not thou seen the people of the Elephant, how dealt\r\n    with them the Lord?\r\n  Did not He make their plot to end in ruin abhorred?--\r\n  When He sent against them birds, horde on horde,\r\n  And stones of baked clay upon them poured,\r\n  And made them as leaves of corn devoured.\"\r\n\r\nThe part played by ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib in the story is, of course, a\r\npious fiction designed to glorify the Holy City and to claim for the\r\nProphet's family fifty years before Islam a predominance which they did\r\nnot obtain until long afterwards; but equally of course the legend\r\nreflects Muḥammadan belief, and may be studied with advantage as a\r\ncharacteristic specimen of its class.\r\n\r\n\"When God repulsed the Abyssinians from Mecca and smote them with His\r\nvengeance, the Arabs held the Quraysh in high respect and said, 'They\r\nare God's people: God hath fought for them and hath defended them\r\nagainst their enemy;' and made poems on this matter.\"[134] The following\r\nverses, according to Ibn Isḥáq, are by Abu ’l-Ṣalt b. Abí Rabí‘a\r\nof Thaqíf; others more reasonably ascribe them to his son Umayya, a\r\nwell-known poet and monotheist (Ḥaníf) contemporary with\r\nMuḥammad:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Verses by Umayya b.

It will be remembered that the Lakhmite dynasty at\r\nḤíra came to an end with Nu‘mán III, who was cruelly executed by\r\nKhusraw Parwéz (602 or 607 A.D.).[136] Before his death he had deposited\r\nhis arms and other property with Háni’, a chieftain of the Banú Bakr.\r\nThese were claimed by Khusraw, and as Háni’ refused to give them up, a\r\nPersian army was sent to Dhú Qár, a place near Kúfa abounding in water\r\nand consequently a favourite resort of the Bakrites during the dry\r\nseason. A desperate conflict ensued, in which the Persians were\r\ncompletely routed.[137] Although the forces engaged were comparatively\r\nsmall,[138] this victory was justly regarded by the Arabs as marking the\r\ncommencement of a new order of things; _e.g._, it is related that\r\nMuḥammad said when the tidings reached him: \"This is the first day on\r\nwhich the Arabs have obtained satisfaction from the Persians.\" The\r\ndesert tribes, hitherto overshadowed by the Sásánian Empire and held in\r\ncheck by the powerful dynasty of Ḥíra, were now confident and\r\naggressive. They began to hate and despise the Colossus which they no\r\nlonger feared, and which, before many years had elapsed, they trampled\r\nin the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPRE-ISLAMIC POETRY, MANNERS, AND RELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When there appeared a poet in a family of the Arabs, the other tribes\r\nround about would gather together to that family and wish them joy of\r\ntheir good luck. Feasts would be got ready, the women of the tribe would\r\njoin together in bands, playing upon lutes, as they were wont to do at\r\nbridals, and the men and boys would congratulate one another; for a poet\r\nwas a defence to the honour of them all, a weapon to ward off insult\r\nfrom their good name, and a means of perpetuating their glorious deeds\r\nand of establishing their fame for ever. And they used not to wish one\r\nanother joy but for three things--the birth of a boy, the coming to\r\nlight of a poet, and the foaling of a noble mare.\"[139]\r\n\r\nAs far as extant literature is concerned--and at this time there was\r\nonly a spoken literature, which was preserved by oral tradition, and\r\nfirst committed to writing long afterwards--the _Jáhiliyya_ or\r\nPre-islamic Age covers scarcely more than a century, from about 500\r\nA.D., when the oldest poems of which we have any record were composed,\r\nto the year of Muḥammad's Flight to Medína (622 A.D.), which is the\r\nstarting-point of a new era in Arabian history. The influence of these\r\nhundred and twenty years was great and lasting. They saw the rise and\r\nincipient decline of a poetry which most Arabic-speaking Moslems have\r\nalways regarded as a model of unapproachable excellence; a poetry rooted\r\nin the life of the people, that insensibly moulded their minds and fixed\r\ntheir character and made them morally and spiritually a nation long\r\nbefore Muḥammad welded the various conflicting groups into a single\r\norganism, animated, for some time at least, by a common purpose. In\r\nthose days poetry was no luxury for the cultured few, but the sole\r\nmedium of literary expression. Every tribe had its poets, who freely\r\nuttered what they felt and thought. Their unwritten words \"flew across\r\nthe desert faster than arrows,\" and came home to the hearts and bosoms\r\nof all who heard them. Thus in the midst of outward strife and\r\ndisintegration a unifying principle was at work. Poetry gave life and\r\ncurrency to an ideal of Arabian virtue (_muruwwa_), which, though based\r\non tribal community of blood and insisting that only ties of blood were\r\nsacred, nevertheless became an invisible bond between diverse clans, and\r\nformed, whether consciously or not, the basis of a national community of\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origins of Arabian poetry]\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I propose to trace the origins of Arabian poetry,\r\nto describe its form, contents, and general features, to give some\r\naccount of the most celebrated Pre-islamic poets and collections of\r\nPre-islamic verse, and finally to show in what manner it was preserved\r\nand handed down.\r\n\r\nBy the ancient Arabs the poet (_shá‘ir_, plural _shu‘ará_), as his name\r\nimplies, was held to be a person endowed with supernatural knowledge, a\r\nwizard in league with spirits (_jinn_) or satans (_shayáṭín_) and\r\ndependent on them for the magical powers which he displayed. This view\r\nof his personality, as well as the influential position which he\r\noccupied, are curiously indicated by the story of a certain youth who\r\nwas refused the hand of his beloved on the ground that he was neither a\r\npoet nor a soothsayer nor a water-diviner.[140] The idea of poetry as an\r\nart was developed afterwards; the pagan _shá‘ir_ is the oracle of his\r\ntribe, their guide in peace and their champion in war. It was to him\r\nthey turned for counsel when they sought new pastures, only at his word\r\nwould they pitch or strike their 'houses of hair,' and when the tired\r\nand thirsty wanderers found a well and drank of its water and washed\r\nthemselves, led by him they may have raised their voices together and\r\nsung, like Israel--\r\n\r\n \"Spring up, O well, sing ye unto it.\"[141]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Satire.]\r\n\r\nBesides fountain-songs, war-songs, and hymns to idols, other kinds of\r\npoetry must have existed in the earliest times--_e.g._, the love-song\r\nand the dirge. The powers of the _shá‘ir_, however, were chiefly\r\nexhibited in Satire (_hijá_), which in the oldest known form \"introduces\r\nand accompanies the tribal feud, and is an element of war just as\r\nimportant as the actual fighting.\"[142] The menaces which he hurled\r\nagainst the foe were believed to be inevitably fatal. His rhymes, often\r\ncompared to arrows, had all the effect of a solemn curse spoken by a\r\ndivinely inspired prophet or priest,[143] and their pronunciation was\r\nattended with peculiar ceremonies of a symbolic character, such as\r\nanointing the hair on one side of the head, letting the mantle hang down\r\nloosely, and wearing only one sandal.[144] Satire retained something of\r\nthese ominous associations at a much later period when the magic\r\nutterance of the _shá‘ir_ had long given place to the lampoon by which\r\nthe poet reviles his enemies and holds them up to shame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saj‘.]\r\n\r\nThe obscure beginnings of Arabian poetry, presided over by the magician\r\nand his familiar spirits, have left not a rack behind in the shape of\r\nliterature, but the task of reconstruction is comparatively easy where\r\nwe are dealing with a people so conservative and tenacious of antiquity\r\nas the Arabs. Thus it may be taken for certain that the oldest form of\r\npoetical speech in Arabia was rhyme without metre (_Saj‘_), or, as we\r\nshould say, 'rhymed prose,' although the fact of Muḥammad's\r\nadversaries calling him a poet because he used it in the Koran shows the\r\nlight in which it was regarded even after the invention and elaboration\r\nof metre. Later on, as we shall see, _Saj‘_ became a merely rhetorical\r\nornament, the distinguishing mark of all eloquence whether spoken or\r\nwritten, but originally it had a deeper, almost religious, significance\r\nas the special form adopted by poets, soothsayers, and the like in their\r\nsupernatural revelations and for conveying to the vulgar every kind of\r\nmysterious and esoteric lore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rajaz.]\r\n\r\nOut of _Saj‘_ was evolved the most ancient of the Arabian metres, which\r\nis known by the name of _Rajaz_.[145] This is an irregular iambic metre\r\nusually consisting of four or six--an Arab would write 'two or\r\nthree'--feet to the line; and it is a peculiarity of _Rajaz_, marking\r\nits affinity to _Saj‘_, that all the lines rhyme with each other,\r\nwhereas in the more artificial metres only the opening verse[146] is\r\ndoubly rhymed. A further characteristic of _Rajaz_ is that it should be\r\nuttered extempore, a few verses at a time--commonly verses expressing\r\nsome personal feeling, emotion, or experience, like those of the aged\r\nwarrior Durayd b. Zayd b. Nahd when he lay dying:--\r\n\r\n \"The house of death[147] is builded for Durayd to-day.\r\n  Could Time be worn out, sure had I worn Time away.\r\n  No single foe but I had faced and brought to bay.\r\n  The spoils I gathered in, how excellent were they!\r\n  The women that I loved, how fine was their array!\"[148]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other metres.]\r\n\r\nHere would have been the proper place to give an account of the\r\nprincipal Arabian metres--the 'Perfect' (_Kámil_), the 'Ample' (_Wáfir_)\r\nthe 'Long' (_Ṭawíl_), the 'Wide' (_Basiṭ_), the 'Light'\r\n(_Khafíf_), and several more--but in order to save valuable space I must\r\ncontent myself with referring the reader to the extremely lucid\r\ntreatment of this subject by Sir Charles Lyall in the Introduction to\r\nhis _Ancient Arabian Poetry_, pp. xlv-lii. All the metres are\r\nquantitative, as in Greek and Latin. Their names and laws were unknown\r\nto the Pre-islamic bards: the rules of prosody were first deduced from\r\nthe ancient poems and systematised by the grammarian, Khalíl b. Ahmad (†\r\n791 A.D.), to whom the idea is said to have occurred as he watched a\r\ncoppersmith beating time on the anvil with his hammer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The oldest extant poems.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the form and matter of the oldest extant poems\r\nin the Arabic language. Between these highly developed productions and\r\nthe rude doggerel of _Saj‘_ or _Rajaz_ there lies an interval, the\r\nlength of which it is impossible even to conjecture. The first poets are\r\nalready consummate masters of the craft. \"The number and complexity of\r\nthe measures which they use, their established laws of quantity and\r\nrhyme, and the uniform manner in which they introduce the subject of\r\ntheir poems,[149] notwithstanding the distance which often separated one\r\ncomposer from another, all point to a long previous study and\r\ncultivation of the art of expression and the capacities of their\r\nlanguage, a study of which no record now remains.\"[150]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their date.]\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the dawn of the Golden Age of Arabian Poetry\r\ncoincided with the first decade of the sixth century after Christ. About\r\nthat time the War of Basús, the chronicle of which has preserved a\r\nconsiderable amount of contemporary verse, was in full blaze; and the\r\nfirst Arabian ode was composed, according to tradition, by Muhalhil b.\r\nRabí‘a the Taghlibite on the death of his brother, the chieftain Kulayb,\r\nwhich caused war to break out between Bakr and Taghlib. At any rate,\r\nduring the next hundred years in almost every part of the peninsula we\r\nmeet with a brilliant succession of singers, all using the same poetical\r\ndialect and strictly adhering to the same rules of composition. The\r\nfashion which they set maintained itself virtually unaltered down to the\r\nend of the Umayyad period (750 A.D.), and though challenged by some\r\ndaring spirits under the ‘Abbásid Caliphate, speedily reasserted its\r\nsupremacy, which at the present day is almost as absolute as ever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Qaṣída.]\r\n\r\nThis fashion centres in the _Qaṣída_,[151] or Ode, the only form, or\r\nrather the only finished type of poetry that existed in what, for want\r\nof a better word, may be called the classical period of Arabic\r\nliterature. The verses (_abyát_, singular _bayt_) of which it is built\r\nvary in number, but are seldom less than twenty-five or more than a\r\nhundred; and the arrangement of the rhymes is such that, while the two\r\nhalves of the first verse rhyme together, the same rhyme is repeated\r\nonce in the second, third, and every following verse to the end of the\r\npoem. Blank-verse is alien to the Arabs, who regard rhyme not as a\r\npleasing ornament or a \"troublesome bondage,\" but as a vital organ of\r\npoetry. The rhymes are usually feminine, _e.g._, sa_khíná_, tu_líná_,\r\nmu_híná_; mukh_lidí_, _yadí_, ‘uw_wadí_; ri_jámuhá_, si_lámuhá_,\r\nḥa_rámuhá_. To surmount the difficulties of the monorhyme demands\r\ngreat technical skill even in a language of which the peculiar formation\r\nrenders the supply of rhymes extraordinarily abundant. The longest of\r\nthe _Mu‘allaqát_, the so-called 'Long Poems,' is considerably shorter\r\nthan Gray's _Elegy_. An Arabian Homer or Chaucer must have condescended\r\nto prose. With respect to metre the poet may choose any except _Rajaz_,\r\nwhich is deemed beneath the dignity of the Ode, but his liberty does not\r\nextend either to the choice of subjects or to the method of handling\r\nthem: on the contrary, the course of his ideas is determined by rigid\r\nconventions which he durst not overstep.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ibn Qutayba's account of the contents and divisions of\r\n  the Ode.]\r\n\r\n  \"I have heard,\" says Ibn Qutayba, \"from a man of learning that the\r\n  composer of Odes began by mentioning the deserted dwelling-places\r\n  and the relics and traces of habitation. Then he wept and complained\r\n  and addressed the desolate encampment, and begged his companion to\r\n  make a halt, in order that he might have occasion to speak of those\r\n  who had once lived there and afterwards departed; for the dwellers\r\n  in tents were different from townsmen or villagers in respect of\r\n  coming and going, because they moved from one water-spring to\r\n  another, seeking pasture and searching out the places where rain had\r\n  fallen. Then to this he linked the erotic prelude (_nasíb_), and\r\n  bewailed the violence of his love and the anguish of separation from\r\n  his mistress and the extremity of his passion and desire, so as to\r\n  win the hearts of his hearers and divert their eyes towards him and\r\n  invite their ears to listen to him, since the song of love touches\r\n  men's souls and takes hold of their hearts, God having put it in the\r\n  constitution of His creatures to love dalliance and the society of\r\n  women, in such wise that we find very few but are attached thereto\r\n  by some tie or have some share therein, whether lawful or\r\n  unpermitted. Now, when the poet had assured himself of an attentive\r\n  hearing, he followed up his advantage and set forth his claim: thus\r\n  he went on to complain of fatigue and want of sleep and travelling\r\n  by night and of the noonday heat, and how his camel had been reduced\r\n  to leanness. And when, after representing all the discomfort and\r\n  danger of his journey, he knew that he had fully justified his hope\r\n  and expectation of receiving his due meed from the person to whom\r\n  the poem was addressed, he entered upon the panegyric (_madíḥ_),\r\n  and incited him to reward, and kindled his generosity by exalting\r\n  him above his peers and pronouncing the greatest dignity, in\r\n  comparison with his, to be little.\"[152]\r\n\r\nHundreds of Odes answer exactly to this description, which must not,\r\nhowever, be regarded as the invariable model. The erotic prelude is\r\noften omitted, especially in elegies; or if it does not lead directly to\r\nthe main subject, it may be followed by a faithful and minute\r\ndelineation of the poet's horse or camel which bears him through the\r\nwilderness with a speed like that of the antelope, the wild ass, or the\r\nostrich: Bedouin poetry abounds in fine studies of animal life.[153] The\r\nchoice of a motive is left open. Panegyric, no doubt, paid better than\r\nany other, and was therefore the favourite; but in Pre-islamic times the\r\npoet could generally please himself. The _qaṣída_ is no organic\r\nwhole: rather its unity resembles that of a series of pictures by the\r\nsame hand or, to employ an Eastern trope, of pearls various in size and\r\nquality threaded on a necklace.\r\n\r\nThe ancient poetry may be defined as an illustrative criticism of\r\nPre-islamic life and thought. Here the Arab has drawn himself at full\r\nlength without embellishment or extenuation.\r\n\r\nIt is not mere chance that Abú Tammám's famous anthology is called the\r\n_Ḥamása_, _i.e._, 'Fortitude,' from the title of its first chapter,\r\nwhich occupies nearly a half of the book. 'Ḥamása' denotes the\r\nvirtues most highly prized by the Arabs--bravery in battle, patience in\r\nmisfortune, persistence in revenge, protection of the weak and defiance\r\nof the strong; the will, as Tennyson has said,\r\n\r\n \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ideal Arab hero.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shanfará.]\r\n\r\nAs types of the ideal Arab hero we may take Shanfará of Azd and his\r\ncomrade in foray, Ta’abbaṭa Sharran. Both were brigands, outlaws,\r\nswift runners, and excellent poets. Of the former\r\n\r\n  \"it is said that he was captured when a child from his tribe by the\r\n  Banú Salámán, and brought up among them: he did not learn his origin\r\n  until he had grown up, when he vowed vengeance against his captors,\r\n  and returned to his own tribe. His oath was that he would slay a\r\n  hundred men of Salámán; he slew ninety-eight, when an ambush of his\r\n  enemies succeeded in taking him prisoner. In the struggle one of his\r\n  hands was hewn off by a sword stroke, and, taking it in the other,\r\n  he flung it in the face of a man of Salámán and killed him, thus\r\n  making ninety-nine. Then he was overpowered and slain, with one\r\n  still wanting to make up his number. As his skull lay bleaching on\r\n  the ground, a man of his enemies passed by that way and kicked it\r\n  with his foot; a splinter of bone entered his foot, the wound\r\n  mortified, and he died, thus completing the hundred.\"[154]\r\n\r\nThe following passage is translated from Shanfará's splendid Ode named\r\n_Lámiyyatu ’l-‘Arab_ (the poem rhymed in _l_ of the Arabs), in which he\r\ndescribes his own heroic character and the hardships of a predatory\r\nlife:--[155]\r\n\r\n \"And somewhere the noble find a refuge afar from scathe,\r\n  The outlaw a lonely spot where no kin with hatred burn.\r\n  Oh, never a prudent man, night-faring in hope or fear,\r\n  Hard pressed on the face of earth, but still he hath room to turn.\r\n\r\n  To me now, in your default, are comrades a wolf untired,\r\n  A sleek leopard, and a fell hyena with shaggy mane:[156]\r\n  True comrades: they ne'er let out the secret in trust with them,\r\n  Nor basely forsake their friend because that he brought them bane.\r\n\r\n  And each is a gallant heart and ready at honour's call,\r\n  Yet I, when the foremost charge, am bravest of all the brave;\r\n  But if they with hands outstretched are seizing the booty won,\r\n  The slowest am I whenas most quick is the greedy knave.\r\n\r\n  By naught save my generous will I reach to the height of worth\r\n  Above them, and sure the best is he with the will to give.\r\n  Yea, well I am rid of those who pay not a kindness back,\r\n  Of whom I have no delight though neighbours to me they live.\r\n\r\n  Know are companions three at last: an intrepid soul,\r\n  A glittering trenchant blade, a tough bow of ample size,\r\n  Loud-twanging, the sides thereof smooth-polished, a handsome bow\r\n  Hung down from the shoulder-belt by thongs in a comely wise,\r\n  That groans, when the arrow slips away, like a woman crushed\r\n  By losses, bereaved of all her children, who wails and cries.\"\r\n\r\nOn quitting his tribe, who cast him out when they were threatened on all\r\nsides by enemies seeking vengeance for the blood that he had spilt,\r\nShanfará said:--\r\n\r\n \"Bury me not! Me you are forbidden to bury,\r\n  But thou, O hyena, soon wilt feast and make merry,\r\n  When foes bear away mine head, wherein is the best of me,\r\n  And leave on the battle-field for thee all the rest of me.\r\n  Here nevermore I hope to live glad--a stranger\r\n  Accurst, whose wild deeds have brought his people in danger.\"[157]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ta’abbaṭa Sharran.]\r\n\r\nThábit b. Jábir b. Sufyán of Fahm is said to have got his nickname,\r\nTa’abbaṭa Sharran, because one day his mother, who had seen him go\r\nforth from his tent with a sword under his arm, on being asked, \"Where\r\nis Thábit?\" replied, \"I know not: he put a mischief under his arm-pit\r\n(_ta’abbaṭa sharran_) and departed.\" According to another version of\r\nthe story, the 'mischief' was a Ghoul whom he vanquished and slew and\r\ncarried home in this manner. The following lines, which he addressed to\r\nhis cousin, Shams b. Málik, may be applied with equal justice to the\r\npoet himself:--\r\n\r\n  \"Little he complains of labour that befalls him; much he wills;\r\n  Diverse ways attempting, mightily his purpose he fulfils.\r\n  Through one desert in the sun's heat, through another in starlight,\r\n  Lonely   as the wild ass, rides he bare-backed Danger noon and night.\r\n  He the foremost wind outpaceth, while in broken gusts it blows,\r\n  Speeding onward, never slackening, never staying for repose.\r\n  Prompt to dash upon the foeman, every minute watching well--\r\n  Are his eyes in slumber lightly sealed, his heart stands sentinel.\r\n  When the first advancing troopers rise to sight, he sets his hand\r\n  From the scabbard forth to draw his sharp-edged, finely-mettled brand.\r\n  When he shakes it in the breast-bone of a champion of the foe,\r\n  How the grinning Fates in open glee their flashing side-teeth show!\r\n  Solitude his chosen comrade, on he fares while overhead\r\n  By the Mother of the mazy constellations he is led.\"[158]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The old Arabian points of honour.]\r\n\r\nThese verses admirably describe the rudimentary Arabian virtues of\r\ncourage, hardness, and strength. We must now take a wider survey of the\r\nmoral ideas on which pagan society was built, and of which Pre-islamic\r\npoetry is at once the promulgation and the record. There was no written\r\ncode, no legal or religious sanction--nothing, in effect, save the\r\nbinding force of traditional sentiment and opinion, _i.e._, Honour.\r\nWhat, then, are the salient points of honour in which Virtue\r\n(_Muruwwa_), as it was understood by the heathen Arabs, consists?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courage.]\r\n\r\nCourage has been already mentioned. Arab courage is like that of the\r\nancient Greeks, \"dependent upon excitement and vanishing quickly before\r\ndepression and delay.\"[159] Hence the Arab hero is defiant and boastful,\r\nas he appears, _e.g._, in the _Mu‘allaqa_ of ‘Amr b. Kulthúm. When there\r\nis little to lose by flight he will ride off unashamed; but he will\r\nfight to the death for his womenfolk, who in serious warfare often\r\naccompanied the tribe and were stationed behind the line of battle.[160]\r\n\r\n \"When I saw the hard earth hollowed\r\n  By our women's flying footprints,\r\n  And Lamís her face uncovered\r\n  Like the full moon of the skies,\r\n  Showing forth her hidden beauties--\r\n  Then the matter was grim earnest:\r\n  I engaged their chief in combat,\r\n  Seeing help no other wise.\"[161]\r\n\r\nThe tribal constitution was a democracy guided by its chief men, who\r\nderived their authority from noble blood, noble character, wealth,\r\nwisdom, and experience. As a Bedouin poet has said in homely language--\r\n\r\n \"A folk that hath no chiefs must soon decay,\r\n  And chiefs it hath not when the vulgar sway.\r\n  Only with poles the tent is reared at last,\r\n  And poles it hath not save the pegs hold fast\r\n  But when the pegs and poles are once combined,\r\n  Then stands accomplished that which was designed.\"[162]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loyalty.]\r\n\r\nThe chiefs, however, durst not lay commands or penalties on their\r\nfellow-tribesmen. Every man ruled himself, and was free to rebuke\r\npresumption in others. \"_If you are our lord_\" (_i.e._, if you act\r\ndiscreetly as a _sayyid_ should), \"_you will lord over us, but if you\r\nare a prey to pride, go and be proud!_\" (_i.e._, we will have nothing to\r\ndo with you).[163] Loyalty in the mouth of a pagan Arab did not mean\r\nallegiance to his superiors, but faithful devotion to his equals; and it\r\nwas closely connected with the idea of kinship. The family and the\r\ntribe, which included strangers living in the tribe under a covenant of\r\nprotection--to defend these, individually and collectively, was a sacred\r\nduty. Honour required that a man should stand by his own people through\r\nthick and thin.\r\n\r\n \"I am of Ghaziyya: if she be in error, then I will err;\r\n  And if Ghaziyya be guided right, I go right with her!\"\r\n\r\nsang Durayd b. Ṣimma, who had followed his kin, against his better\r\njudgment, in a foray which cost the life of his brother ‘Abdulláh.[164]\r\nIf kinsmen seek help it should be given promptly, without respect to the\r\nmerits of the case; if they do wrong it should be suffered as long as\r\npossible before resorting to violence.[165] The utilitarian view of\r\nfriendship is often emphasised, as in these verses:--\r\n\r\n  Take for thy brother whom thou wilt in the days of peace,\r\n  But know that when fighting comes thy kinsman alone is near.\r\n  Thy true friend thy kinsman is, who answers thy call for aid\r\n  With good will, when deeply drenched in bloodshed are sword and spear.\r\n  Oh, never forsake thy kinsman e'en tho' he do thee wrong,\r\n  For what he hath marred he mends thereafter and makes sincere.\"[166]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, notwithstanding their shrewd common sense, nothing is\r\nmore characteristic of the Arabs--heathen and Muḥammadan alike--than\r\nthe chivalrous devotion and disinterested self-sacrifice of which they\r\nare capable on behalf of their friends. In particular, the ancient\r\npoetry affords proof that they regarded with horror any breach of the\r\nsolemn covenant plighted between patron and client or host and guest.\r\nThis topic might be illustrated by many striking examples, but one will\r\nsuffice:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The story of Samaw’al b. ‘Adiyá.]\r\n\r\n  The Arabs say: \"_Awfá mina ’l-Samaw’ali_\"--\"More loyal than\r\n  al-Samaw’al\"; or _Wafáun ka-wafá’i ’l-Samaw’ali_\"--\" A loyalty like\r\n  that of al-Samaw’al.\" These proverbs refer to Samaw’al b. ‘Adiyá, an\r\n  Arab of Jewish descent and Jew by religion, who lived in his castle,\r\n  called al-Ablaq (The Piebald), at Taymá, some distance north of\r\n  Medína. There he dug a well of sweet water, and would entertain the\r\n  Arabs who used to alight beside it; and they supplied themselves\r\n  with provisions from his castle and set up a market. It is related\r\n  that the poet Imru’u ’l-Qays, while fleeing, hotly pursued by his\r\n  enemies, towards Syria, took refuge with Samaw’al, and before\r\n  proceeding on his way left in charge of his host five coats of mail\r\n  which had been handed down as heirlooms by the princes of his\r\n  family. Then he departed, and in due course arrived at\r\n  Constantinople, where he besought the Byzantine emperor to help him\r\n  to recover his lost kingdom. His appeal was not unsuccessful, but he\r\n  died on the way home. Meanwhile his old enemy, the King of Ḥíra,\r\n  sent an army under Ḥárith b. Ẓálim against Samaw’al, demanding\r\n  that he should surrender the coats of mail. Samaw’al refused to\r\n  betray the trust committed to him, and defended himself in his\r\n  castle. The besiegers, however, captured his son, who had gone out\r\n  to hunt. Ḥárith asked Samaw’al: \"Dost thou know this lad?\" \"Yes,\r\n  he is my son.\" \"Then wilt thou deliver what is in thy possession, or\r\n  shall I slay him?\" Samaw’al answered: \"Do with him as thou wilt. I\r\n  will never break my pledge nor give up the property of my\r\n  guest-friend.\" So Ḥárith smote the lad with his sword and clove\r\n  him through the middle. Then he raised the siege. And Samaw’al said\r\n  thereupon:--\r\n\r\n  \"_I was true with the mail-coats of the Kindite,[167]\r\n    I am true though many a one is blamed for treason.\r\n    Once did ‘Ádiyá, my father, exhort me:\r\n   'O Samaw’al, ne'er destroy what I have builded.'\r\n    For me built ‘Ádiyá a strong-walled castle\r\n    With a well where I draw water at pleasure;\r\n    So high, the eagle slipping back is baffled.\r\n    When wrong befalls me I endure not tamely._\"[168]\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin ideal of generosity and hospitality is personified in\r\nḤátim of Ṭayyi’, of whom many anecdotes are told. We may learn\r\nfrom the following one how extravagant are an Arab's notions on this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ḥátim of Ṭayyi’.]\r\n\r\n  When Ḥátim's mother was pregnant she dreamed that she was asked,\r\n  \"Which dost thou prefer?--a generous son called Ḥátim, or ten\r\n  like those of other folk, lions in the hour of battle, brave lads\r\n  and strong of limb?\" and that she answered, \"Ḥátim.\" Now, when\r\n  Ḥátim grew up he was wont to take out his food, and if he found\r\n  any one to share it he would eat, otherwise he threw it away. His\r\n  father, seeing that he wasted his food, gave him a slave-girl and a\r\n  mare with her foal and sent him to herd the camels. On reaching the\r\n  pasture, Ḥátim began to search for his fellows, but none was in\r\n  sight; then he came to the road, but found no one there. While he\r\n  was thus engaged he descried a party of riders on the road and went\r\n  to meet them. \"O youth,\" said they, \"hast thou aught to entertain us\r\n  withal?\" He answered: \"Do ye ask me of entertainment when ye see the\r\n  camels?\" Now, these riders were ‘Abíd b. al-Abras and Bishr b. Abí\r\n  Kházim and Nábigha al-Dhubyání, and they were on their way to King\r\n  Nu‘mán.[169] Ḥátim slaughtered three camels for them, whereupon\r\n  ‘Abíd said: \"We desired no entertainment save milk, but if thou must\r\n  needs charge thyself with something more, a single young she-camel\r\n  would have sufficed us.\" Ḥátim replied: \"That I know, but seeing\r\n  different faces and diverse fashions I thought ye were not of the\r\n  same country, and I wished that each of you should mention what ye\r\n  saw, on returning home.\" So they spoke verses in praise of him and\r\n  celebrated his generosity, and Ḥátim said: \"I wished to bestow a\r\n  kindness upon you, but your bounty is greater than mine. I swear to\r\n  God that I will hamstring every camel in the herd unless ye come\r\n  forward and divide them among yourselves.\" The poets did as he\r\n  desired, and each man received ninety-nine camels; then they\r\n  proceeded on their journey to Nu‘mán. When Ḥátim's father heard\r\n  of this he came to him and asked, \"Where are the camels?\" \"O my\r\n  father,\" replied Ḥátim, \"by means of them I have conferred on\r\n  thee everlasting fame and honour that will cleave to thee like the\r\n  ring of the ringdove, and men will always bear in mind some verse of\r\n  poetry in which we are praised. This is thy recompense for the\r\n  camels.\" On hearing these words his father said, \"Didst thou with my\r\n  camels thus?\" \"Yes.\" \"By God, I will never dwell with thee again.\"\r\n  So he went forth with his family, and Ḥátim was left alone with\r\n  his slave-girl and his mare and the mare's foal.[170]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥátim's daughter before the Prophet.]\r\n\r\nWe are told that Ḥátim's daughter was led as a captive before the\r\nProphet and thus addressed him: \"'O Muḥammad, my sire is dead, and he\r\nwho would have come to plead for me is gone. Release me, if it seem good\r\nto thee, and do not let the Arabs rejoice at my misfortune; for I am the\r\ndaughter of the chieftain of my people. My father was wont to free the\r\ncaptive, and protect those near and dear to him, and entertain the\r\nguest, and satisfy the hungry, and console the afflicted, and give food\r\nand greeting to all; and never did he turn away any who sought a boon. I\r\nam Ḥátim's daughter.' The Prophet (on whom be the blessing and peace\r\nof God) answered her: 'O maiden, the true believer is such as thou hast\r\ndescribed. Had thy father been an Islamite, verily we should have said,\r\n\"God have mercy upon him!\" Let her go,' he continued, 'for her sire\r\nloved noble manners, and God loves them likewise.'\"[171]\r\n\r\nḤátim was a poet of some repute.[172] The following lines are\r\naddressed to his wife, Máwiyya:--\r\n\r\n \"O daughter of ‘Abdulláh and Málik and him who wore\r\n  The two robes of Yemen stuff--the hero that rode the roan,\r\n  When thou hast prepared the meal, entreat to partake thereof\r\n  A guest--I am not the man to eat, like a churl, alone--:\r\n  Some traveller thro' the night, or house-neighbour; for in sooth\r\n  I fear the reproachful talk of men after I am gone.\r\n  The guest's slave am I, 'tis true, as long as he bides with me,\r\n  Although in my nature else no trait of the slave is shown.\"[173]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of women.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabian heroines.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fáṭima daughter of Khurshub.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fukayha.]\r\n\r\nHere it will be convenient to make a short digression in order that the\r\nreader may obtain, if not a complete view, at least some glimpses of the\r\nposition and influence of women in Pre-islamic society. On the whole,\r\ntheir position was high and their influence great. They were free to\r\nchoose their husbands, and could return, if ill-treated or displeased,\r\nto their own people; in some cases they even offered themselves in\r\nmarriage and had the right of divorce. They were regarded not as slaves\r\nand chattels, but as equals and companions. They inspired the poet to\r\nsing and the warrior to fight. The chivalry of the Middle Ages is,\r\nperhaps, ultimately traceable to heathen Arabia. \"Knight-errantry, the\r\nriding forth on horseback in search of adventures, the rescue of captive\r\nmaidens, the succour rendered everywhere to women in adversity--all\r\nthese were essentially Arabian ideas, as was the very name of\r\n_chivalry_, the connection of honourable conduct with the horse-rider,\r\nthe man of noble blood, the cavalier.\"[174] But the nobility of the\r\nwomen is not only reflected in the heroism and devotion of the men; it\r\nstands recorded in song, in legend, and in history. Fáṭima, the\r\ndaughter of Khurshub, was one of three noble matrons who bore the title\r\n_al-Munjibát_, 'the Mothers of Heroes.' She had seven sons, three of\r\nwhom, viz., Rabí‘ and ‘Umára and Anas, were called 'the Perfect'\r\n(_al-Kamala_). One day Ḥamal b. Badr the Fazárite raided the Banú\r\n‘Abs, the tribe to which Fáṭima belonged, and made her his prisoner.\r\nAs he led away the camel on which she was mounted at the time, she\r\ncried: \"Man, thy wits are wandering. By God, if thou take me captive,\r\nand if we leave behind us this hill which is now in front of us, surely\r\nthere will never be peace between thee and the sons of Ziyád\" (Ziyád was\r\nthe name of her husband), \"because people will say what they please, and\r\nthe mere suspicion of evil is enough.\" \"I will carry thee off,\" said he,\r\n\"that thou mayest herd my camels.\" When Fáṭima knew that she was\r\ncertainly his prisoner she threw herself headlong from her camel and\r\ndied; so did she fear to bring dishonour on her sons.[175] Among the\r\nnames which have become proverbial for loyalty we find those of two\r\nwomen, Fukayha and Umm Jamíl. As to Fukayha, it is related that her\r\nclansmen, having been raided by the brigand Sulayk b. Sulaka, resolved\r\nto attack him; but since he was a famous runner, on the advice of one of\r\ntheir shaykhs they waited until he had gone down to the water and\r\nquenched his thirst, for they knew that he would then be unable to run.\r\nSulayk, however, seeing himself caught, made for the nearest tents and\r\nsought refuge with Fukayha. She threw her smock over him, and stood with\r\ndrawn sword between him and his pursuers; and as they still pressed on,\r\nshe tore the veil from her hair and shouted for help. Then her brothers\r\ncame and defended Sulayk, so that his life was saved.[176] Had space\r\nallowed, it would have been a pleasant task to make some further\r\nextracts from the long Legend of Noble Women. I have illustrated their\r\nkeen sense of honour and loyalty, but I might equally well have chosen\r\nexamples of gracious dignity and quick intelligence and passionate\r\naffection. Many among them had the gift of poetry, which they bestowed\r\nespecially on the dead; it is a final proof of the high character and\r\nposition of women in Pre-islamic Arabia that the hero's mother and\r\nsisters were deemed most worthy to mourn and praise him. The praise of\r\nliving women by their lovers necessarily takes a different tone; the\r\nphysical charms of the heroine are fully described, but we seldom find\r\nany appreciation of moral beauty. One notable exception to this rule\r\noccurs at the beginning of an ode by Shanfará. The passage defies\r\ntranslation. It is, to quote Sir Charles Lyall, with whose faithful and\r\nsympathetic rendering of the ancient poetry every student of Arabic\r\nliterature should be acquainted, \"the most lovely picture of womanhood\r\nwhich heathen Arabia has left us, drawn by the same hand that has given\r\nus, in the unrivalled _Lâmîyah_, its highest ideal of heroic hardness\r\nand virile strength.\"[177]\r\n\r\n\r\n  UMAYMA.\r\n\r\n \"She charmed me, veiling bashfully her face,\r\n  Keeping with quiet looks an even pace;\r\n  Some lost thing seem to seek her downcast eyes:\r\n  Aside she bends not--softly she replies.\r\n  Ere dawn she carries forth her meal--a gift\r\n  To hungry wives in days of dearth and thrift.\r\n  No breath of blame up to her tent is borne,\r\n  While many a neighbour's is the house of scorn.\r\n  Her husband fears no gossip fraught with shame,\r\n  For pure and holy is Umayma's name.\r\n  Joy of his heart, to her he need not say\r\n  When evening brings him home--'Where passed the day?'\r\n  Slender and full in turn, of perfect height,\r\n  A very fay were she, if beauty might\r\n  Transform a child of earth into a fairy sprite!\"[178]\r\n\r\nOnly in the freedom of the desert could the character thus exquisitely\r\ndelineated bloom and ripen. These verses, taken by themselves, are a\r\nsufficient answer to any one who would maintain that Islam has increased\r\nthe social influence of Arabian women, although in some respects it may\r\nhave raised them to a higher level of civilisation.[179]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Infanticide.]\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, another side to all this. In a land where might was\r\ngenerally right, and where\r\n\r\n                    \"the simple plan\r\n  That he should take who has the power\r\n  And he should keep who can,\"\r\n\r\nwas all but universally adopted, it would have been strange if the\r\nweaker sex had not often gone to the wall. The custom which prevailed in\r\nthe _Jáhiliyya_ of burying female infants alive, revolting as it appears\r\nto us, was due partly to the frequent famines with which Arabia is\r\nafflicted through lack of rain, and partly to a perverted sense of\r\nhonour. Fathers feared lest they should have useless mouths to feed, or\r\nlest they should incur disgrace in consequence of their daughters being\r\nmade prisoners of war. Hence the birth of a daughter was reckoned\r\ncalamitous, as we read in the Koran: \"_They attribute daughters unto\r\nGod--far be it from Him!--and for themselves they desire them not. When\r\na female child is announced to one of them, his face darkens wrathfully:\r\nhe hides himself from his people because of the bad news,\r\nthinking--'Shall I keep the child to my disgrace or cover it away in the\r\ndust?'_\"[180] It was said proverbially, \"The despatch of daughters is a\r\nkindness\" and \"The burial of daughters is a noble deed.\"[181] Islam put\r\nan end to this barbarity, which is expressly forbidden by the Koran:\r\n\"_Kill not your children in fear of impoverishment: we will provide for\r\nthem and for you: verily their killing was a great sin._\"[182] Perhaps\r\nthe most touching lines in Arabian poetry are those in which a father\r\nstruggling with poverty wishes that his daughter may die before him and\r\nthus be saved from the hard mercies of her relatives:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE POOR MAN'S DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n \"But for Umayma's sake I ne'er had grieved to want nor braved\r\n  Night's blackest horror to bring home the morsel that she craved.\r\n  Now my desire is length of days because I know too well\r\n  The orphan girl's hard lot, with kin unkind enforced to dwell.\r\n  I dread that some day poverty will overtake my child,\r\n  And shame befall her when exposed to every passion wild.[183]\r\n  She wishes me to live, but I must wish her dead, woe's me:\r\n  Death is the noblest wooer a helpless maid can see.\r\n  I fear an uncle may be harsh, a brother be unkind,\r\n  When I would never speak a word that rankled in her mind.\"[184]\r\n\r\nAnd another says:--\r\n\r\n \"Were not my little daughters\r\n  Like soft chicks huddling by me,\r\n  Through earth and all its waters\r\n  To win bread would I roam free.\r\n\r\n  Our children among us going,\r\n  Our very hearts they be;\r\n  The wind upon them blowing\r\n  Would banish sleep from me.\"[185]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of enemies.]\r\n\r\n\"Odi et amo\": these words of the poet might serve as an epitome of\r\nBedouin ethics. For, if the heathen Arab was, as we have seen, a good\r\nfriend to his friends, he had in the same degree an intense and deadly\r\nfeeling of hatred towards his enemies. He who did not strike back when\r\nstruck was regarded as a coward. No honourable man could forgive an\r\ninjury or fail to avenge it. An Arab, smarting under the loss of some\r\ncamels driven off by raiders, said of his kin who refused to help him:--\r\n\r\n \"For all their numbers, they are good for naught,\r\n  My people, against harm however light:\r\n  They pardon wrong by evildoers wrought,\r\n  Malice with loving kindness they requite.\"[186]\r\n\r\nThe last verse, which would have been high praise in the mouth of a\r\nChristian or Muḥammadan moralist, conveyed to those who heard it a\r\nshameful reproach. The approved method of dealing with an enemy is set\r\nforth plainly enough in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n \"Humble him who humbles thee, close tho' be your kindredship:\r\n  If thou canst not humble him, wait till he is in thy grip.\r\n  Friend him while thou must; strike hard when thou hast him on\r\n    the hip.\"[187]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blood-revenge.]\r\n\r\nAbove all, blood called for blood. This obligation lay heavy on the\r\nconscience of the pagan Arabs. Vengeance, with them, was \"almost a\r\nphysical necessity, which if it be not obeyed will deprive its subject\r\nof sleep, of appetite, of health.\" It was a tormenting thirst which\r\nnothing would quench except blood, a disease of honour which might be\r\ndescribed as madness, although it rarely prevented the sufferer from\r\ngoing to work with coolness and circumspection. Vengeance was taken upon\r\nthe murderer, if possible, or else upon one of his fellow-tribesmen.\r\nUsually this ended the matter, but in some cases it was the beginning of\r\na regular blood-feud in which the entire kin of both parties were\r\ninvolved; as, _e.g._, the murder of Kulayb led to the Forty Years' War\r\nbetween Bakr and Taghlib.[188] The slain man's next of kin might accept\r\na blood-wit (_diya_), commonly paid in camels--the coin of the\r\ncountry--as atonement for him. If they did so, however, it was apt to be\r\ncast in their teeth that they preferred milk (_i.e._, she-camels) to\r\nblood.[189] The true Arab feeling is expressed in verses like these:--\r\n\r\n \"With the sword will I wash my shame away,\r\n  Let God's doom bring on me what it may!\"[190]\r\n\r\nIt was believed that until vengeance had been taken for the dead man,\r\nhis spirit appeared above his tomb in the shape of an owl (_háma_ or\r\n_ṣadá_), crying \"_Isqúní_\" (\"Give me to drink\"). But pagan ideas of\r\nvengeance were bound up with the Past far more than with the Future. The\r\nshadowy after-life counted for little or nothing beside the\r\ndeeply-rooted memories of fatherly affection, filial piety, and\r\nbrotherhood in arms.\r\n\r\nThough liable to abuse, the rough-and-ready justice of the vendetta had\r\na salutary effect in restraining those who would otherwise have indulged\r\ntheir lawless instincts without fear of punishment. From our point of\r\nview, however, its interest is not so much that of a primitive\r\ninstitution as of a pervading element in old Arabian life and\r\nliterature. Full, or even adequate, illustration of this topic would\r\ncarry me far beyond the limits of my plan. I have therefore selected\r\nfrom the copious material preserved in the _Book of Songs_ a\r\ncharacteristic story which tells how Qays b. al-Khaṭím took vengeance\r\non the murderers of his father and his grandfather.[191]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The story of the vengeance of Qays b. al-Khaṭím.]\r\n\r\n  It is related on the authority of Abú ‘Ubayda that ‘Adí b. ‘Amr, the\r\n  grandfather of Qays, was slain by a man named Málik belonging to the\r\n  Banú ‘Amr b. ‘Ámir b. Rabí‘a b. ‘Ámir b. Ṣa‘ṣa‘a; and his\r\n  father, Khaṭím b. ‘Adí, by one of the Banú ‘Abd al-Qays who were\r\n  settled in Hajar. Khaṭím died before avenging his father, ‘Adí,\r\n  when Qays was but a young lad. The mother of Qays, fearing that he\r\n  would sally forth to seek vengeance for the blood of his father and\r\n  his grandfather and perish, went to a mound of dust beside the door\r\n  of their dwelling and laid stones on it, and began to say to Qays,\r\n  \"This is the grave of thy father and thy grandfather;\" and Qays\r\n  never doubted but that it was so. He grew up strong in the arms, and\r\n  one day he had a tussle with a youth of the Banú Ẓafar, who said\r\n  to him: \"By God, thou would'st do better to turn the strength of\r\n  thine arms against the slayers of thy father and grandfather instead\r\n  of putting it forth upon me.\" \"And who are their slayers?\" \"Ask thy\r\n  mother, she will tell thee.\" So Qays took his sword and set its hilt\r\n  on the ground and its edge between his two breasts, and said to his\r\n  mother: \"Who killed my father and my grandfather?\" \"They died as\r\n  people die, and these are their graves in the camping-ground.\" \"By\r\n  God, verily thou wilt tell me who slew them or I will bear with my\r\n  whole weight upon this sword until it cleaves through my back.\" Then\r\n  she told him, and Qays swore that he would never rest until he had\r\n  slain their slayers. \"O my son,\" said she, \"Málik, who killed thy\r\n  grandfather, is of the same folk as Khidásh b. Zuhayr, and thy\r\n  father once bestowed a kindness on Khidásh, for which he is\r\n  grateful. Go, then, to him and take counsel with him touching thine\r\n  affair and ask him to help thee.\" So Qays set out immediately, and\r\n  when he came to the garden where his water-camel was watering his\r\n  date-palms, he smote the cord (of the bucket) with his sword and cut\r\n  it, so that the bucket dropped into the well. Then he took hold of\r\n  the camel's head, and loaded the beast with two sacks of dates, and\r\n  said: \"Who will care for this old woman\" (meaning his mother) \"in my\r\n  absence? If I die, let him pay her expenses out of this garden, and\r\n  on her death it shall be his own; but if I live, my property will\r\n  return to me, and he shall have as many of its dates as he wishes to\r\n  eat.\" One of his folk cried, \"I am for it,\" so Qays gave him the\r\n  garden and set forth to inquire concerning Khidásh. He was told to\r\n  look for him at Marr al-Ẓahrán, but not finding him in his tent,\r\n  he alighted beneath a tree, in the shade of which the guests of\r\n  Khidásh used to shelter, and called to the wife of Khidásh, \"Is\r\n  there any food?\" Now, when she came up to him, she admired his\r\n  comeliness--for he was exceeding fair of countenance--and said: \"By\r\n  God, we have no fit entertainment for thee, but only dates.\" He\r\n  replied, \"I care not, bring out what thou hast.\" So she sent to him\r\n  dates in a large measure (_qubá‘_), and Qays took a single date and\r\n  ate half of it and put back the other half in the _qubá‘_, and gave\r\n  orders that the _qubá‘_ should be brought in to the wife of Khidásh;\r\n  then he departed on some business. When Khidásh returned and his\r\n  wife told him the news of Qays, he said, \"This is a man who would\r\n  render his person sacred.\"[192] While he sat there with his wife\r\n  eating fresh ripe dates, Qays returned on camel-back; and Khidásh,\r\n  when he saw the foot of the approaching rider, said to his wife, \"Is\r\n  this thy guest?\" \"Yes.\" \"'Tis as though his foot were the foot of my\r\n  good friend, Khaṭím the Yathribite.\" Qays drew nigh, and struck\r\n  the tent-rope with the point of his spear, and begged leave to come\r\n  in. Having obtained permission, he entered to Khidásh and told his\r\n  lineage and informed him of what had passed, and asked him to help\r\n  and advise him in his affair. Khidásh bade him welcome, and recalled\r\n  the kindness which he had of his father, and said, \"As to this\r\n  affair, truly I have been expecting it of thee for some time. The\r\n  slayer of thy grandfather is a cousin of mine, and I will aid thee\r\n  against him. When we are assembled in our meeting-place, I will sit\r\n  beside him and talk with him, and when I strike his thigh, do thou\r\n  spring on him and slay him.\" Qays himself relates: \"Accompanied by\r\n  Khidásh, I approached him until I stood over his head when Khidásh\r\n  sat with him, and as soon as he struck the man's thigh I smote his\r\n  head with a sword named _Dhu ’l-Khurṣayn_\" (the Two-ringed). \"His\r\n  folk rushed on me to slay me, but Khidásh came between us, crying,\r\n  'Let him alone, for, by God, he has slain none but the slayer of his\r\n  grandfather.'\" Then Khidásh called for one of his camels and mounted\r\n  it, and started with Qays to find the ‘Abdite who killed his father.\r\n  And when they were near Hajar Khidásh advised him to go and inquire\r\n  after this man, and to say to him when he discovered him: \"I\r\n  encountered a brigand of thy people who robbed me of some articles,\r\n  and on asking who was the chieftain of his people I was directed to\r\n  thee. Go with me, then, that thou mayest take from him my property.\r\n  If,\" Khidásh continued, \"he follow thee unattended, thou wilt gain\r\n  thy desire of him; but should he bid the others go with thee, laugh,\r\n  and if he ask why thou laughest, say, 'With us, the noble does not\r\n  as thou dost, but when he is called to a brigand of his people, he\r\n  goes forth alone with his whip, not with his sword; and the brigand\r\n  when he sees him gives him everything that he took, in awe of him.'\r\n  If he shall dismiss his friends, thy course is clear; but if he\r\n  shall refuse to go without them, bring him to me nevertheless, for I\r\n  hope that thou wilt slay both him and them.\" So Khidásh stationed\r\n  himself under the shade of a tree, while Qays went to the ‘Abdite\r\n  and addressed him as Khidásh had prompted; and the man's sense of\r\n  honour was touched to the quick, so that he sent away his friends\r\n  and went with Qays. And when Qays came back to Khidásh, the latter\r\n  said to him, \"Choose, O Qays! Shall I help thee or shall I take thy\r\n  place?\" Qays answered, \"I desire neither of these alternatives, but\r\n  if he slay me, let him not slay thee!\" Then he rushed upon him and\r\n  wounded him in the flank and drove his lance through the other side,\r\n  and he fell dead on the spot. When Qays had finished with him,\r\n  Khidásh said, \"If we flee just now, his folk will pursue us; but let\r\n  us go somewhere not far off, for they will never think that thou\r\n  hast slain him and stayed in the neighbourhood. No; they will miss\r\n  him and follow his track, and when they find him slain they will\r\n  start to pursue us in every direction, and will only return when\r\n  they have lost hope.\" So those two entered some hollows of the sand,\r\n  and after staying there several days (for it happened exactly as\r\n  Khidásh had foretold), they came forth when the pursuit was over,\r\n  and did not exchange a word until they reached the abode of Khidásh.\r\n  There Qays parted from him and returned to his own people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Song of Vengeance by Ta’abbaṭa Sharran.]\r\n\r\nThe poems relating to blood-revenge show all that is best and much that\r\nis less admirable in the heathen Arab--on the one hand, his courage and\r\nresolution, his contempt of death and fear of dishonour, his\r\nsingle-minded devotion to the dead as to the living, his deep regard and\r\ntender affection for the men of his own flesh and blood; on the other\r\nhand, his implacable temper, his perfidious cruelty and reckless\r\nferocity in hunting down the slayers, and his savage, well-nigh inhuman\r\nexultation over the slain. The famous Song or Ballad of Vengeance that I\r\nshall now attempt to render in English verse is usually attributed to\r\nTa’abbaṭa Sharran,[193] although some pronounce it to be a forgery by\r\nKhalaf al-Aḥmar, the reputed author of Shanfará's masterpiece, and\r\nbeyond doubt a marvellously skilful imitator of the ancient bards. Be\r\nthat as it may, the ballad is utterly pagan in tone and feeling. Its\r\nextraordinary merit was detected by Goethe, who, after reading it in a\r\nLatin translation, published a German rendering, with some fine\r\ncriticism of the poetry, in his _West-oestlicher Divan_.[194] I have\r\nendeavoured to suggest as far as possible the metre and rhythm of the\r\noriginal, since to these, in my opinion, its peculiar effect is largely\r\ndue. The metre is that known as the 'Tall' (_Madíd_), viz.:--\r\n\r\n   ⌣      |⌣    |\r\n   - ⌣ - -|- ⌣ -|- ⌣ - -\r\n\r\nThus the first verse runs in Arabic:--\r\n\r\n _Inna bi’l-shi‘ | bi ’lladhi |‘inda Sal‘in\r\n  la-qatílan | damuhú | má yuṭallu._\r\n\r\nOf course, Arabic prosody differs radically from English, but _mutatis\r\nmutandis_ several couplets in the following version (_e.g._ the third,\r\neighth, and ninth) will be found to correspond exactly with their model.\r\nAs has been said, however, my object was merely to suggest the abrupt\r\nmetre and the heavy, emphatic cadences, so that I have been able to give\r\nvariety to the verse, and at the same time to retain that artistic\r\nfreedom without which the translator of poetry cannot hope to satisfy\r\neither himself or any one else.\r\n\r\nThe poet tells how he was summoned to avenge his uncle, slain by the\r\ntribesmen of Hudhayl: he describes the dead man's heroic character, the\r\nforay in which he fell, his former triumphs over the same enemy, and\r\nfinally the terrible vengeance taken for him.[195]\r\n\r\n \"In the glen there a murdered man is lying--\r\n  Not in vain for vengeance his blood is crying.\r\n  He hath left me the load to bear and departed;\r\n  I take up the load and bear it true-hearted.\r\n  I, his sister's son, the bloodshed inherit,\r\n  I whose knot none looses, stubborn of spirit;[196]\r\n  Glowering darkly, shame's deadly out-wiper,\r\n  Like the serpent spitting venom, the viper.\r\n  Hard the tidings that befell us, heart-breaking;\r\n  Little seemed thereby the anguish most aching.\r\n  Fate hath robbed me--still is Fate fierce and froward--\r\n  Of a hero whose friend ne'er called him coward:\r\n  As the warm sun was he in wintry weather,\r\n  'Neath the Dog-star shade and coolness together:\r\n  Spare of flank--yet this in him showed not meanness;\r\n  Open-handed, full of boldness and keenness:\r\n  Firm of purpose, cavalier unaffrighted--\r\n  Courage rode with him and with him alighted:\r\n  In his bounty, a bursting cloud of rain-water;\r\n  Lion grim when he leaped to the slaughter.\r\n  Flowing hair, long robe his folk saw aforetime,\r\n  But a lean-haunched wolf was he in war-time.\r\n  Savours two he had, untasted by no men:\r\n  Honey to his friends and gall to his foemen.\r\n  Fear he rode nor recked what should betide him:\r\n  Save his deep-notched Yemen blade, none beside him.\r\n\r\n  Oh, the warriors girt with swords good for slashing,\r\n  Like the levin, when they drew them, outflashing!\r\n  Through the noonday heat they fared: then, benighted,\r\n  Farther fared, till at dawning they alighted.[197]\r\n  Breaths of sleep they sipped; and then, while they nodded,\r\n  Thou didst scare them: lo, they scattered and scudded.\r\n  Vengeance wreaked we upon them, unforgiving:\r\n  Of the two clans scarce was left a soul living.[198]\r\n\r\n  Ay, if _they_ bruised his glaive's edge 'twas in token\r\n  That by him many a time their own was broken.\r\n  Oft he made them kneel down by force and cunning--\r\n  Kneel on jags where the foot is torn with running.\r\n  Many a morn in shelter he took them napping;\r\n  After killing was the rieving and rapine.\r\n\r\n  They have gotten of me a roasting--I tire not\r\n  Of desiring them till me they desire not.\r\n  First, of foemen's blood my spear deeply drinketh,\r\n  Then a second time, deep in, it sinketh.\r\n  Lawful now to me is wine, long forbidden:\r\n  Sore my struggle ere the ban was o'erridden.[199]\r\n  Pour me wine, O son of ‘Amr! I would taste it,\r\n  Since with grief for mine uncle I am wasted.\r\n  O'er the fallen of Hudhayl stands screaming\r\n  The hyena; see the wolf's teeth gleaming!\r\n  Dawn will hear the flap of wings, will discover\r\n  Vultures treading corpses, too gorged to hover.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honour conferred by noble ancestry.]\r\n\r\nAll the virtues which enter into the Arabian conception of Honour were\r\nregarded not as personal qualities inherent or acquired, but as\r\nhereditary possessions which a man derived from his ancestors, and held\r\nin trust that he might transmit them untarnished to his descendants. It\r\nis the desire to uphold and emulate the fame of his forbears, rather\r\nthan the hope of winning immortality for himself, that causes the Arab\r\n\"to say the say and do the deeds of the noble.\" Far from sharing the\r\nsentiment of the Scots peasant--\"a man's a man for a' that\"--he looks\r\naskance at merit and renown unconsecrated by tradition.\r\n\r\n \"The glories that have grown up with the grass\r\n  Can match not those inherited of old.\"[200]\r\n\r\nAncestral renown (_ḥasab_) is sometimes likened to a strong castle\r\nbuilt by sires for their sons, or to a lofty mountain which defies\r\nattack.[201] The poets are full of boastings (_mafákhir_) and revilings\r\n(_mathálib_) in which they loudly proclaim the nobility of their own\r\nancestors, and try to blacken those of their enemy without any regard to\r\ndecorum.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to add here some general remarks on Arabian poetry\r\nas compared with that of the Hebrews, the Persians, and our own, but\r\nsince example is better than precept I will now turn directly to those\r\ncelebrated odes which are well known by the title of _Mu‘-allaqát_, or\r\n'Suspended Poems,' to all who take the slightest interest in Arabic\r\nliterature.[202]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mu‘allaqát, or 'Suspended Poems.']\r\n\r\n_Mu‘allaqa_ (plural, _Mu‘allaqát_) \"is most likely derived from the word\r\n_‘ilq_, meaning 'a precious thing or a thing held in high estimation,'\r\neither because one 'hangs on' tenaciously to it, or because it is 'hung\r\nup' in a place of honour, or in a conspicuous place, in a treasury or\r\nstorehouse.\"[203] In course of time the exact signification of\r\n_Mu‘allaqa_ was forgotten, and it became necessary to find a plausible\r\nexplanation. Hence arose the legend, which frequent repetition has made\r\nfamiliar, that the 'Suspended Poems' were so called from having been\r\nhung up in the Ka‘ba on account of their merit; that this distinction\r\nwas awarded by the judges at the fair of ‘Ukáẓ, near Mecca, where\r\npoets met in rivalry and recited their choicest productions; and that\r\nthe successful compositions, before being affixed to the door of the\r\nKa‘ba, were transcribed in letters of gold upon pieces of fine Egyptian\r\nlinen.[204] Were these statements true, we should expect them to be\r\nconfirmed by some allusion in the early literature. But as a matter of\r\nfact nothing of the kind is mentioned in the Koran or in religious\r\ntradition, in the ancient histories of Mecca, or in such works as the\r\n_Kitábu ’l-Aghání_, which draw their information from old and\r\ntrustworthy sources.[205] Almost the first authority who refers to the\r\nlegend is the grammarian Aḥmad al-Naḥḥás († 949 A.D.), and\r\nby him it is stigmatised as entirely groundless. Moreover, although it\r\nwas accepted by scholars like Reiske, Sir W. Jones, and even De Sacy, it\r\nis incredible in itself. Hengstenberg, in the Prolegomena to his edition\r\nof the _Mu‘-allaqa_ of Imru’u ’l-Qays (Bonn, 1823) asked some pertinent\r\nquestions: Who were the judges, and how were they appointed? Why were\r\nonly these seven poems thus distinguished? His further objection, that\r\nthe art of writing was at that time a rare accomplishment, does not\r\ncarry so much weight as he attached to it, but the story is sufficiently\r\nrefuted by what we know of the character and customs of the Arabs in the\r\nsixth century and afterwards. Is it conceivable that the proud sons of\r\nthe desert could have submitted a matter so nearly touching their tribal\r\nhonour, of which they were jealous above all things, to external\r\narbitration, or meekly acquiesced in the partial verdict of a court\r\nsitting in the neighbourhood of Mecca, which would certainly have shown\r\nscant consideration for competitors belonging to distant clans?[206]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of the collection.]\r\n\r\nHowever _Mu‘allaqa_ is to be explained, the name is not contemporary\r\nwith the poems themselves. In all probability they were so entitled by\r\nthe person who first chose them out of innumerable others and embodied\r\nthem in a separate collection. This is generally allowed to have been\r\nḤammád al-Ráwiya, a famous rhapsodist who flourished in the latter\r\ndays of the Umayyad dynasty, and died about 772 A.D., in the reign of\r\nthe ‘Abbásid Caliph Mahdí. What principle guided Ḥammád in his choice\r\nwe do not know. Nöldeke conjectures that he was influenced by the fact\r\nthat all the _Mu‘allaqát_ are long poems--they are sometimes called 'The\r\nSeven Long Poems' (_al-Sab‘ al-Ṭiwál_)--for in Ḥammád's time\r\nlittle of the ancient Arabian poetry survived in a state even of\r\nrelative completeness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of translating the Mu‘allaqát.]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that no rendering of the _Mu‘allaqát_ can furnish\r\nEuropean readers with a just idea of the originals, a literal version\r\nleast of all. They contain much that only a full commentary can make\r\nintelligible, much that to modern taste is absolutely incongruous with\r\nthe poetic style. Their finest pictures of Bedouin life and manners\r\noften appear uncouth or grotesque, because without an intimate knowledge\r\nof the land and people it is impossible for us to see what the poet\r\nintended to convey, or to appreciate the truth and beauty of its\r\nexpression; while the artificial framework, the narrow range of subject\r\nas well as treatment, and the frank realism of the whole strike us at\r\nonce. In the following pages I shall give some account of the\r\n_Mu‘allaqát_ and their authors, and endeavour to bring out the\r\ncharacteristic qualities of each poem by selecting suitable passages for\r\ntranslation.[207]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Imru’u ’l-Qays.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest and most famous of the _Mu‘allaqát_ is that of Imru’u\r\n’l-Qays, who was descended from the ancient kings of Yemen. His\r\ngrandfather was King Ḥárith of Kinda, the antagonist of Mundhir III,\r\nKing of Ḥíra, by whom he was defeated and slain.[208] On Ḥárith's\r\ndeath, the confederacy which he had built up split asunder, and his sons\r\ndivided among themselves the different tribes of which it was composed.\r\nḤujr, the poet's father, ruled for some time over the Banú Asad in\r\nCentral Arabia, but finally they revolted and put him to death. \"The\r\nduty of avenging his murder fell upon Imru’u ’l-Qays, who is represented\r\nas the only capable prince of his family; and the few historical data\r\nwhich we have regarding him relate to his adventures while bent upon\r\nthis vengeance.\"[209] They are told at considerable length in the\r\n_Kitábu ’l-Aghání_, but need not detain us here. Suffice it to say that\r\nhis efforts to punish the rebels, who were aided by Mundhir, the\r\nhereditary foe of his house, met with little success. He then set out\r\nfor Constantinople, where he was favourably received by the Emperor\r\nJustinian, who desired to see the power of Kinda re-established as a\r\nthorn in the side of his Persian rivals. The emperor appointed him\r\nPhylarch of Palestine, but on his way thither he died at Angora (about\r\n540 A.D.). He is said to have perished, like Nessus, from putting on a\r\npoisoned robe sent to him as a gift by Justinian, with whose daughter he\r\nhad an intrigue. Hence he is sometimes called 'The Man of the Ulcers'\r\n(_Dhu ’l-Qurúḥ_).\r\n\r\nMany fabulous traditions surround the romantic figure of Imru’u\r\n’l-Qays.[210] According to one story, he was banished by his father, who\r\ndespised him for being a poet and was enraged by the scandals to which\r\nhis love adventures gave rise. Imru’u ’l-Qays left his home and wandered\r\nfrom tribe to tribe with a company of outcasts like himself, leading a\r\nwild life, which caused him to be known as 'The Vagabond Prince'\r\n(_al-Malik al-Ḑillíl_). When the news of his father's death reached\r\nhim he cried, \"My father wasted my youth, and now that I am old he has\r\nlaid upon me the burden of blood-revenge. Wine to-day, business\r\nto-morrow!\" Seven nights he continued the carouse; then he swore not to\r\neat flesh, nor drink wine, nor use ointment, nor touch woman, nor wash\r\nhis head until his vengeance was accomplished. In the valley of Tabála,\r\nnorth of Najrán, there was an idol called Dhu ’l-Khalaṣa much\r\nreverenced by the heathen Arabs. Imru’u ’l-Qays visited this oracle and\r\nconsulted it in the ordinary way, by drawing one of three arrows\r\nentitled 'the Commanding,' 'the Forbidding,' and 'the Waiting.' He drew\r\nthe second, whereupon he broke the arrows and dashed them on the face of\r\nthe idol, exclaiming with a gross imprecation, \"If _thy_ father had been\r\nslain, thou would'st not have hindered me!\"\r\n\r\nImru’u ’l-Qays is almost universally reckoned the greatest of the\r\nPre-islamic poets. Muḥammad described him as 'their leader to\r\nHell-fire,' while the Caliphs ‘Umar and ‘Alí, _odium theologicum_\r\nnotwithstanding, extolled his genius and originality.[211] Coming to the\r\n_Mu‘allaqa_ itself, European critics have vied with each other in\r\npraising its exquisite diction and splendid images, the sweet flow of\r\nthe verse, the charm and variety of the painting, and, above all, the\r\nfeeling by which it is inspired of the joy and glory of youth. The\r\npassage translated below is taken from the first half of the poem, in\r\nwhich love is the prevailing theme:--[212]\r\n\r\n \"Once, on the hill, she mocked at me and swore,\r\n 'This hour I leave thee to return no more,'\r\n  Soft! if farewell is planted in thy mind,\r\n  Yet spare me, Fáṭima, disdain unkind.\r\n  Because my passion slays me, wilt thou part?\r\n  Because thy wish is law unto mine heart?\r\n  Nay, if thou so mislikest aught in me,\r\n  Shake loose my robe and let it fall down free.\r\n  But ah, the deadly pair, thy streaming eyes!\r\n  They pierce a heart that all in ruin lies.\r\n\r\n  How many a noble tent hath oped its treasure\r\n  To me, and I have ta'en my fill of pleasure,\r\n  Passing the warders who with eager speed\r\n  Had slain me, if they might but hush the deed,\r\n  What time in heaven the Pleiades unfold\r\n  A belt of orient gems distinct with gold.\r\n  I entered. By the curtain there stood she,\r\n  Clad lightly as for sleep, and looked on me.\r\n  'By God,' she cried, 'what recks thee of the cost?\r\n  I see thine ancient madness is not lost.'\r\n  I led her forth--she trailing as we go\r\n  Her broidered skirt, lest any footprint show--\r\n  Until beyond the tents the valley sank\r\n  With curving dunes and many a pilèd bank,\r\n  Then with both hands I drew her head to mine,\r\n  And lovingly the damsel did incline\r\n  Her slender waist and legs more plump than fine;--\r\n  A graceful figure, a complexion bright,\r\n  A bosom like a mirror in the light;\r\n  A white pale virgin pearl such lustre keeps,\r\n  Fed with clear water in untrodden deeps.\r\n  Now she bends half away: two cheeks appear,\r\n  And such an eye as marks the frighted deer\r\n  Beside her fawn; and lo, the shapely neck\r\n  Not bare of ornament, else without a fleck;\r\n  While from her shoulders in profusion fair,\r\n  Like clusters on the palm, hangs down her coal-dark hair.\"\r\n\r\nIn strange contrast with this tender and delicate idyll are the wild,\r\nhard verses almost immediately following, in which the poet roaming\r\nthrough the barren waste hears the howl of a starved wolf and hails him\r\nas a comrade:--\r\n\r\n \"Each one of us what thing he finds devours:\r\n  Lean is the wretch whose living is like ours.\"[213]\r\n\r\nThe noble qualities of his horse and its prowess in the chase are\r\ndescribed, and the poem ends with a magnificent picture of a\r\nthunder-storm among the hills of Najd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṭarafa.]\r\n\r\nṬarafa b. al-‘Abd was a member of the great tribe of Bakr. The\r\nparticular clan to which he belonged was settled in Baḥrayn on the\r\nPersian Gulf. He early developed a talent for satire, which he exercised\r\nupon friend and foe indifferently; and after he had squandered his\r\npatrimony in dissolute pleasures, his family chased him away as though\r\nhe were 'a mangy camel.' At length a reconciliation was effected. He\r\npromised to mend his ways, returned to his people, and took part, it is\r\nsaid, in the War of Basús. In a little while his means were dissipated\r\nonce more and he was reduced to tend his brother's herds. His\r\n_Mu‘allaqa_ composed at this time won for him the favour of a rich\r\nkinsman and restored him to temporary independence. On the conclusion of\r\npeace between Bakr and Taghlib the youthful poet turned his eyes in the\r\ndirection of Ḥíra, where ‘Amr b. Hind had lately succeeded to the\r\nthrone (554 A.D.). He was well received by the king, who attached him,\r\nalong with his uncle, the poet Mutalammis, to the service of the\r\nheir-apparent. But Ṭarafa's bitter tongue was destined to cost him\r\ndear. Fatigued and disgusted by the rigid ceremony of the court, he\r\nimprovised a satire in which he said--\r\n\r\n \"Would that we had instead of ‘Amr\r\n  A milch-ewe bleating round our tent!\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he happened to be seated at table opposite the king's\r\nsister. Struck with her beauty, he exclaimed--\r\n\r\n \"Behold, she has come back to me,\r\n    My fair gazelle whose ear-rings shine;\r\n  Had not the king been sitting here,\r\n    I would have pressed her lips to mine!\"\r\n\r\n‘Amr b. Hind was a man of violent and implacable temper. Ṭarafa's\r\nsatire had already been reported to him, and this new impertinence added\r\nfuel to his wrath. Sending for Ṭarafa and Mutalammis, he granted them\r\nleave to visit their homes, and gave to each of them a sealed letter\r\naddressed to the governor of Baḥrayn. When they had passed outside\r\nthe city the suspicions of Mutalammis were aroused. As neither he nor\r\nhis companion could read, he handed his own letter to a boy of\r\nḤíra[214] and learned that it contained orders to bury him alive.\r\nThereupon he flung the treacherous missive into the stream and implored\r\nṬarafa to do likewise. Ṭarafa refused to break the royal seal. He\r\ncontinued his journey to Baḥrayn, where he was thrown into prison and\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThus perished miserably in the flower of his youth--according to some\r\naccounts he was not yet twenty--the passionate and eloquent Ṭarafa.\r\nIn his _Mu‘allaqa_ he has drawn a spirited portrait of himself. The most\r\nstriking feature of the poem, apart from a long and, to us who are not\r\nBedouins, painfully tedious description of the camel, is its insistence\r\non sensual enjoyment as the sole business of life:--\r\n\r\n \"Canst thou make me immortal, O thou that blamest me so\r\n  For haunting the battle and loving the pleasures that fly?\r\n  If thou hast not the power to ward me from Death, let me go\r\n  To meet him and scatter the wealth in my hand, ere I die.\r\n\r\n  Save only for three things in which noble youth take delight,\r\n  I care not how soon rises o'er me the coronach loud:\r\n  Wine that foams when the water is poured on it, ruddy, not bright.\r\n  Dark wine that I quaff stol'n away from the cavilling crowd;\r\n\r\n  \"And second, my charge at the cry of distress on a steed\r\n  Bow-legged like the wolf you have startled when thirsty he cowers;\r\n  And third, the day-long with a lass in her tent of goat's hair\r\n  To hear the wild rain and beguile of their slowness the hours.\"[215]\r\n\r\nKeeping, as far as possible, the chronological order, we have now to\r\nmention two _Mu‘allaqas_ which, though not directly related to each\r\nother,[216] are of the same period--the reign of ‘Amr b. Hind, King of\r\nḤíra (554-568 A.D.). Moreover, their strong mutual resemblance and their\r\ndifference from the other _Mu‘allaqas_, especially from typical\r\n_qaṣídas_ like those of ‘Antara and Labíd, is a further reason for\r\nlinking them together. Their distinguishing mark is the abnormal space\r\ndevoted to the main subject, which leaves little room for the\r\nsubsidiary motives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Amr b. Kulthúm.]\r\n\r\n‘Amr b. Kulthúm belonged to the tribe of Taghlib. His mother was Laylá,\r\na daughter of the famous poet and warrior Muhalhil. That she was a woman\r\nof heroic mould appears from the following anecdote, which records a\r\ndeed of prompt vengeance on the part of ‘Amr that gave rise to the\r\nproverb, \"Bolder in onset than ‘Amr b. Kulthúm\"[217]:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: How ’Amr avenged an insult to his mother.]\r\n\r\n  One day ‘Amr. b. Hind, the King of Ḥíra, said to his\r\n  boon-companions, \"Do ye know any Arab whose mother would disdain to\r\n  serve mine?\" They answered, \"Yes, the mother of ‘Amr b. Kulthúm.\"\r\n  \"Why so?\" asked the king. \"Because,\" said they, \"her father is\r\n  Muhalhil b. Rabí‘a and her uncle is Kulayb b. Wá’il, the most\r\n  puissant of the Arabs, and her husband is Kulthúm b. Málik, the\r\n  knightliest, and her son is ‘Amr, the chieftain of his tribe.\" Then\r\n  the king sent to ‘Amr b. Kulthúm, inviting him to pay a visit to\r\n  himself, and asking him to bring his mother, Laylá, to visit his own\r\n  mother, Hind. So ‘Amr came to Ḥíra with some men of Taghlib, and\r\n  Laylá came attended by a number of their women; and while the king\r\n  entertained ‘Amr and his friends in a pavilion which he had caused\r\n  to be erected between Ḥíra and the Euphrates, Laylá found\r\n  quarters with Hind in a tent adjoining. Now, the king had ordered\r\n  his mother, as soon as he should call for dessert, to dismiss the\r\n  servants, and cause Laylá to wait upon her. At the pre-arranged\r\n  signal she desired to be left alone with her guest, and said, \"O\r\n  Laylá, hand me that dish.\" Laylá answered, \"Let those who want\r\n  anything rise up and serve themselves.\" Hind repeated her demand,\r\n  and would take no denial. \"O shame!\" cried Laylá. \"Help! Taghlib,\r\n  help!\" When ‘Amr heard his mother's cry the blood flew to his\r\n  cheeks. He seized a sword hanging on the wall of the pavilion--the\r\n  only weapon there--and with a single blow smote the king dead.[218]\r\n\r\n‘Amr's _Mu‘allaqa_ is the work of a man who united in himself the ideal\r\nqualities of manhood as these were understood by a race which has never\r\nfailed to value, even too highly, the display of self-reliant action and\r\ndecisive energy. And if in ‘Amr's poem these virtues are displayed with\r\nan exaggerated boastfulness which offends our sense of decency and\r\nproper reserve, it would be a grave error to conclude that all this\r\nsound and fury signifies nothing. The Bedouin poet deems it his bounden\r\nduty to glorify to the utmost himself, his family, and his tribe; the\r\nBedouin warrior is never tired of proclaiming his unshakable valour and\r\nrecounting his brilliant feats of arms: he hurls menaces and vaunts in\r\nthe same breath, but it does not follow that he is a _Miles Gloriosus_.\r\n‘Amr certainly was not: his _Mu‘allaqa_ leaves a vivid impression of\r\nconscious and exultant strength. The first eight verses seem to have\r\nbeen added to the poem at a very early date, for out of them arose the\r\nlegend that ‘Amr drank himself to death with unmixed wine. It is likely\r\nthat they were included in the original collection of the _Mu‘allaqát_,\r\nand they are worth translating for their own sake:---\r\n\r\n \"Up, maiden! Fetch the morning-drink and spare not\r\n          The wine of Andarín,\r\n  Clear wine that takes a saffron hue when water\r\n          Is mingled warm therein.\r\n  The lover tasting it forgets his passion,\r\n          His heart is eased of pain;\r\n  The stingy miser, as he lifts the goblet,\r\n          Regardeth not his gain.\r\n\r\n  Pass round from left to right! Why let'st thou, maiden,\r\n          Me and my comrades thirst?\r\n  Yet am I, whom thou wilt not serve this morning,\r\n          Of us three not the worst!\r\n  Many a cup in Baalbec and Damascus\r\n          And Qáṣirín I drained,\r\n  Howbeit we, ordained to death, shall one day\r\n          Meet death, to us ordained.\"[219]\r\n\r\nIn the next passage he describes his grief at the departure of his\r\nbeloved, whom he sees in imagination arriving at her journey's end in\r\ndistant Yamáma:--\r\n\r\n \"And oh, my love and yearning when at nightfall\r\n          I saw her camels haste,\r\n  Until sharp peaks uptowered like serried sword-blades,\r\n          And me Yamáma faced!\r\n  Such grief no mother-camel feels, bemoaning\r\n          Her young one lost, nor she,\r\n  The grey-haired woman whose hard fate hath left her\r\n          Of nine sons graves thrice three.\"[220]\r\n\r\nNow the poet turns abruptly to his main theme. He addresses the King of\r\nḤíra, ‘Amr b. Hind, in terms of defiance, and warns the foes of\r\nTaghlib that they will meet more than their match:--\r\n\r\n \"Father of Hind,[221] take heed and ere thou movest\r\n          Rashly against us, learn\r\n  That still our banners go down white to battle\r\n          And home blood-red return.\r\n  And many a chief bediademed, the champion\r\n          Of the outlaws of the land,\r\n  Have we o'erthrown and stripped him, while around him\r\n          Fast-reined the horses stand.\r\n  Our neighbours lopped like thorn-trees, snarls in terror\r\n          Of us the demon-hound;[222]\r\n  Never we try our hand-mill on the foemen\r\n          But surely they are ground.\r\n  We are the heirs of glory, all Ma‘add knows,[223]\r\n          Our lances it defend,\r\n  And when the tent-pole tumbles in the foray,\r\n          Trust us to save our friend![224]\r\n\r\n  O ‘Amr, what mean'st thou? Are we, we of Taghlib,\r\n          Thy princeling's retinue?\r\n  O ‘Amr, what mean'st thou, rating us and hearkening\r\n          To tale-bearers untrue?\r\n  O ‘Amr, ere thee full many a time our spear-shaft\r\n          Has baffled foes to bow;[225]\r\n  Nipped in the vice it kicks like a wild camel\r\n          That will no touch allow--\r\n  Like a wild camel, so it creaks in bending\r\n          And splits the bender's brow!\"[226]\r\n\r\nThe _Mu‘allaqa_ ends with a eulogy, superb in its extravagance, of the\r\npoet's tribe:--\r\n\r\n \"Well wot, when our tents rise along their valleys,\r\n          The men of every clan\r\n  That we give death to them that durst attempt us,\r\n          To friends what food we can;\r\n  That staunchly we maintain a cause we cherish,\r\n          Camp where we choose to ride,\r\n  Nor will we aught of peace, when we are angered,\r\n          Till we be satisfied.\r\n  We keep our vassals safe and sound, but rebels\r\n          We soon force to their knees;\r\n  And if we reach a well, we drink pure water,\r\n          Others the muddy lees.\r\n  Ours is the earth and all thereon: when _we_ strike,\r\n          There needs no second blow;\r\n  Kings lay before the new-weaned boy of Taghlib\r\n          Their heads in homage low.\r\n  We are called oppressors, being none, but shortly\r\n          A true name shall it be![227]\r\n  We have so filled the earth 'tis narrow for us,\r\n          And with our ships the sea![228]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥárith b. Ḥilliza.]\r\n\r\nLess interesting is the _Mu‘allaqa_ of Ḥárith b. Ḥilliza of Bakr.\r\nIts inclusion among the _Mu‘allaqát_ is probably due, as Nöldeke\r\nsuggested, to the fact that Ḥammád, himself a client of Bakr, wished\r\nto flatter his patrons by selecting a counterpart to the _Mu‘allaqa_ of\r\n‘Amr b. Kulthúm, which immortalised their great rivals, the Banú\r\nTaghlib. Ḥárith's poem, however, has some historical importance, as\r\nit throws light on feuds in Northern Arabia connected with the\r\nantagonism of the Roman and Persian Empires. Its purpose is to complain\r\nof unjust accusations made against the Banú Bakr by a certain group of\r\nthe Banú Taghlib known as the Aráqim:--\r\n\r\n \"Our brothers the Aráqim let their tongues\r\n          Against us rail unmeasuredly.\r\n  The innocent with the guilty they confound:\r\n          Of guilt what boots it to be free?\r\n  They brand us patrons of the vilest deed,\r\n          Our clients in each miscreant see.\"[229]\r\n\r\nA person whom Ḥárith does not name was 'blackening' the Banú Bakr\r\nbefore the King of Ḥíra. The poet tells him not to imagine that his\r\ncalumnies will have any lasting effect: often had Bakr been slandered by\r\ntheir foes, but (he finely adds):--\r\n\r\n \"Maugre their hate we stand, by firm-based might\r\n          Exalted and by ancestry--\r\n  Might which ere now hath dazzled men's eyes: thence scorn\r\n          To yield and haughty spirit have we.\r\n  On us the Days beat as on mountain dark\r\n          That soars in cloudless majesty,\r\n  Compact against the hard calamitous shocks\r\n          And buffetings of Destiny.\"[230]\r\n\r\nHe appeals to the offenders not wantonly to break the peace which\r\nended the War of Basús:--\r\n\r\n \"Leave folly and error! If ye blind yourselves,\r\n          Just therein lies the malady.\r\n  Recall the oaths of Dhu ’l-Majáz[231] for which\r\n          Hostages gave security,\r\n  Lest force or guile should break them: can caprice\r\n          Annul the parchments utterly?[232]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Antara.]\r\n\r\n‘Antara b. Shaddád, whose father belonged to the tribe of ‘Abs,\r\ndistinguished himself in the War of Dáḥis.[233] In modern times it is\r\nnot as a poet that he is chiefly remembered, but as a hero of\r\nromance--the Bedouin Achilles. Goddess-born, however, he could not be\r\ncalled by any stretch of imagination. His mother was a black slave, and\r\nhe must often have been taunted with his African blood, which showed\r\nitself in a fiery courage that gained the respect of the pure-bred but\r\ngenerally less valorous Arabs. ‘Antara loved his cousin ‘Abla, and\r\nfollowing the Arabian custom by which cousins have the first right to a\r\ngirl's hand, he asked her in marriage. His suit was vain--the son of a\r\nslave mother being regarded as a slave unless acknowledged by his\r\nfather--until on one occasion, while the ‘Absites were hotly engaged\r\nwith some raiders who had driven off their camels, ‘Antara refused to\r\njoin in the mêlée, saying, \"A slave does not understand how to fight;\r\nhis work is to milk the camels and bind their udders.\" \"Charge!\" cried\r\nhis father, \"thou art free.\" Though ‘Antara uttered no idle boast when\r\nhe sang--\r\n\r\n \"On one side nobly born and of the best\r\n  Of ‘Abs am I: my sword makes good the rest!\"\r\n\r\nhis contemptuous references to 'jabbering barbarians,' and to 'slaves\r\nwith their ears cut off, clad in sheepskins,' are characteristic of the\r\nman who had risen to eminence in spite of the stain on his scutcheon. He\r\ndied at a great age in a foray against the neighbouring tribe of\r\nṬayyi’. His _Mu‘allaqa_ is famous for its stirring battle-scenes, one\r\nof which is translated here:--[234]\r\n\r\n \"Learn, Málik's daughter, how\r\n    I rush into the fray,\r\n  And how I draw back only\r\n    At sharing of the prey.\r\n\r\n  I never quit the saddle,\r\n    My strong steed nimbly bounds;\r\n  Warrior after warrior\r\n    Have covered him with wounds.\r\n\r\n  Full-armed against me stood\r\n    One feared of fighting men:\r\n  He fled not oversoon\r\n    Nor let himself be ta'en.\r\n\r\n  With straight hard-shafted spear\r\n    I dealt him in his side\r\n  A sudden thrust which opened\r\n    Two streaming gashes wide,\r\n\r\n  Two gashes whence outgurgled\r\n    His life-blood: at the sound\r\n  Night-roaming ravenous wolves\r\n    Flock eagerly around.\r\n\r\n  So with my doughty spear\r\n    I trussed his coat of mail--\r\n  For truly, when the spear strikes,\r\n    The noblest man is frail--\r\n\r\n  And left him low to banquet\r\n    The wild beasts gathering there;\r\n  They have torn off his fingers,\r\n    His wrist and fingers fair!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zuhayr.]\r\n\r\nWhile ‘Antara's poem belongs to the final stages of the War of Dáḥis,\r\nthe _Mu‘allaqa_ of his contemporary, Zuhayr b. Abí Sulmá, of the tribe\r\nof Muzayna, celebrates an act of private munificence which brought about\r\nthe conclusion of peace. By the self-sacrificing intervention of two\r\nchiefs of Dhubyán, Harim b. Sinán and Ḥárith b. ‘Awf, the whole sum\r\nof blood-money to which the ‘Absites were entitled on account of the\r\ngreater number of those who had fallen on their side, was paid over to\r\nthem. Such an example of generous and disinterested patriotism--for\r\nHarim and Ḥárith had shed no blood themselves--was a fit subject for\r\none of whom it was said that he never praised men but as they\r\ndeserved:--\r\n\r\n  Noble pair of Ghayẓ ibn Murra,[235] well ye laboured to restore\r\n  Ties of kindred hewn asunder by the bloody strokes of war.\r\n  Witness now mine oath the ancient House in Mecca's hallowed bound,[236]\r\n  Which its builders of Quraysh and Jurhum solemnly went round,[237]\r\n  That in hard or easy issue never wanting were ye found!\r\n  Peace ye gave to ‘Abs and Dhubyán when each fell by other's hand\r\n  And the evil fumes they pestled up between them filled the land.\"[238]\r\n\r\nAt the end of his panegyric the poet, turning to the lately reconciled\r\ntribesmen and their confederates, earnestly warns them against nursing\r\nthoughts of vengeance:--\r\n\r\n  \"Will ye hide from God the guilt ye dare not unto Him disclose?\r\n  Verily, what thing soever ye would hide from God, He knows.\r\n  Either it is laid up meantime in a scroll and treasured there\r\n  For the day of retribution, or avenged all unaware.[239]\r\n  War ye have known and war have tasted: not by hearsay are ye wise.\r\n  Raise no more the hideous monster! If ye let her raven, she cries\r\n  Ravenously for blood and crushes, like a mill-stone, all below,\r\n  And from her twin-conceiving womb she brings forth woe on woe.\"[240]\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat obscure passage concerning the lawless deeds of a\r\ncertain Ḥusayn b. Ḑamḍam, which had well-nigh caused a fresh\r\noutbreak of hostilities, Zuhayr proceeds, with a natural and touching\r\nallusion to his venerable age, to enforce the lessons of conduct and\r\nmorality suggested by the situation:--\r\n\r\n \"I am weary of life's burden: well a man may weary be\r\n  After eighty years, and this much now is manifest to me:\r\n  Death is like a night-blind camel stumbling on:--the smitten die\r\n  But the others age and wax in weakness whom he passes by.\r\n  He that often deals with folk in unkind fashion, underneath\r\n  They will trample him and make him feel the sharpness of their teeth.\r\n  He that hath enough and over and is niggard with his pelf\r\n  Will be hated of his people and left free to praise himself.\r\n  He alone who with fair actions ever fortifies his fame\r\n  Wins it fully: blame will find him out unless he shrinks from blame.\r\n  He that for his cistern's guarding trusts not in his own stout arm\r\n  Sees it ruined: he must harm his foe or he must suffer harm.\r\n  He that fears the bridge of Death across it finally is driven,\r\n  Though he span as with a ladder all the space 'twixt earth and heaven.\r\n  He that will not take the lance's butt-end while he has the chance\r\n  Must thereafter be contented with the spike-end of the lance.\r\n  He that keeps his word is blamed not; he whose heart repaireth straight\r\n  To the sanctuary of duty never needs to hesitate.\r\n  He that hies abroad to strangers doth account his friends his foes;\r\n  He that honours not himself lacks honour wheresoe'er he goes.\r\n  Be a man's true nature what it will, that nature is revealed\r\n  To his neighbours, let him fancy as he may that 'tis concealed.\"[241]\r\n\r\nThe ripe sententious wisdom and moral earnestness of Zuhayr's poetry are\r\nin keeping with what has been said above concerning his religious ideas\r\nand, from another point of view, with the tradition that he used to\r\ncompose a _qaṣída_ in four months, correct it for four months, submit\r\nit to the poets of his acquaintance during a like period, and not make\r\nit public until a year had expired.\r\n\r\nOf his life there is little to tell. Probably he died before Islam,\r\nthough it is related that when he was a centenarian he met the Prophet,\r\nwho cried out on seeing him, \"O God, preserve me from his demon!\"[242]\r\nThe poetical gifts which he inherited from his uncle Basháma he\r\nbequeathed to his son Ka‘b, author of the famous ode, _Bánat Su‘ád_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Labíd.]\r\n\r\nLabíd b. Rabí‘a, of the Banú ‘Ámir b. Ṣa‘ṣa‘a, was born in the\r\nlatter half of the sixth century, and is said to have died soon after\r\nMu‘áwiya's accession to the Caliphate, which took place in A.D. 661. He\r\nis thus the youngest of the Seven Poets. On accepting Islam he abjured\r\npoetry, saying, \"God has given me the Koran in exchange for it.\" Like\r\nZuhayr, he had, even in his heathen days, a strong vein of religious\r\nfeeling, as is shown by many passages in his Díwán.\r\n\r\nLabíd was a true Bedouin, and his _Mu‘allaqa_, with its charmingly fresh\r\npictures of desert life and scenery, must be considered one of the\r\nfinest examples of the Pre-islamic _qaṣída_ that have come down to\r\nus. The poet owes something to his predecessors, but the greater part\r\nseems to be drawn from his own observation. He begins in the\r\nconventional manner by describing the almost unrecognisable vestiges of\r\nthe camping-ground of the clan to which his mistress belonged:--\r\n\r\n \"Waste lies the land where once alighted and did wone\r\n  The people of Miná: Rijám and Ghawl are lone.\r\n  The camp in Rayyán's vale is marked by relics dim\r\n  Like weather-beaten script engraved on ancient stone.\r\n  Over this ruined scene, since it was desolate,\r\n  Whole years with secular and sacred months had flown.\r\n  In spring 'twas blest by showers 'neath starry influence shed,\r\n  And thunder-clouds bestowed a scant or copious boon.\r\n  Pale herbs had shot up, ostriches on either slope\r\n  Their chicks had gotten and gazelles their young had thrown;\r\n  And large-eyed wild-cows there beside the new-born calves\r\n  Reclined, while round them formed a troop the calves half-grown.\r\n  Torrents of rain had swept the dusty ruins bare,\r\n  Until, as writing freshly charactered, they shone,\r\n  Or like to curved tattoo-lines on a woman's arm,\r\n  With soot besprinkled so that every line is shown.\r\n  I stopped and asked, but what avails it that we ask\r\n  Dumb changeless things that speak a language all unknown?\"[243]\r\n\r\nAfter lamenting the departure of his beloved the poet bids himself think\r\nno more about her: he will ride swiftly away from the spot. Naturally,\r\nhe must praise his camel, and he introduces by way of comparison two\r\nwonderful pictures of animal life. In the former the onager is described\r\nracing at full speed over the backs of the hills when thirst and hunger\r\ndrive him with his mate far from the barren solitudes into which they\r\nusually retire. The second paints a wild-cow, whose young calf has been\r\ndevoured by wolves, sleeping among the sand-dunes through a night of\r\nincessant rain. At daybreak \"her feet glide over the firm wet soil.\" For\r\na whole week she runs to and fro, anxiously seeking her calf, when\r\nsuddenly she hears the sound of hunters approaching and makes off in\r\nalarm. Being unable to get within bowshot, the hunters loose their dogs,\r\nbut she turns desperately upon them, wounding one with her needle-like\r\nhorn and killing another.\r\n\r\nThen, once more addressing his beloved, the poet speaks complacently of\r\nhis share in the feasting and revelling, on which a noble Arab plumes\r\nhimself hardly less than on his bravery:--\r\n\r\n \"Know'st thou not, O Nawár, that I am wont to tie\r\n  The cords of love, yet also snap them without fear?\r\n  That I abandon places when I like them not,\r\n  Unless Death chain the soul and straiten her career?\r\n  Nay, surely, but thou know'st not I have passed in talk\r\n  Many a cool night of pleasure and convivial cheer,\r\n  And often to a booth, above which hung for sign\r\n  A banner, have resorted when old wine was dear.\r\n  For no light price I purchased many a dusky skin\r\n  Or black clay jar, and broached it that the juice ran clear;\r\n  And many a song of shrill-voiced singing-girl I paid,\r\n  And her whose fingers made sweet music to mine ear.\"[244]\r\n\r\nContinuing, he boasts of dangerous service as a spy in the enemy's\r\ncountry, when he watched all day on the top of a steep crag; of his\r\nfearless demeanour and dignified assertion of his rights in an assembly\r\nat Ḥíra, to which he came as a delegate, and of his liberality to the\r\npoor. The closing verses are devoted, in accordance with custom, to\r\nmatters of immediate interest and to a panegyric on the virtues of the\r\npoet's kin.\r\n\r\nBesides the authors of the _Mu‘allaqát_ three poets may be mentioned, of\r\nwhom the two first-named are universally acknowledged to rank with the\r\ngreatest that Arabia has produced--Nábigha, A‘shá, and ‘Alqama.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nábigha of Dhubyán.]\r\n\r\nNábigha[245]--his proper name is Ziyád b. Mu‘áwiya, of the tribe\r\nDhubyán--lived at the courts of Ghassán and Ḥíra during the latter\r\nhalf of the century before Islam. His chief patron was King Nu‘mán b.\r\nMundhir Abú Qábús of Ḥíra. For many years he basked in the sunshine\r\nof royal favour, enjoying every privilege that Nu‘mán bestowed on his\r\nmost intimate friends. The occasion of their falling out is differently\r\nrelated. According to one story, the poet described the charms of Queen\r\nMutajarrida, which Nu‘mán had asked him to celebrate, with such charm\r\nand liveliness as to excite her husband's suspicion; but it is said--and\r\nNábigha's own words make it probable--that his enemies denounced him as\r\nthe author of a scurrilous satire against Nu‘mán which had been forged\r\nby themselves. At any rate he had no choice but to quit Ḥíra with all\r\nspeed, and ere long we find him in Ghassán, welcomed and honoured, as\r\nthe panegyrist of King ‘Amr b. Ḥárith and the noble house of Jafna.\r\nBut his heart was in Ḥíra still. Deeply wounded by the calumnies of\r\nwhich he was the victim, he never ceased to affirm his innocence and to\r\nlament the misery of exile. The following poem, which he addressed to\r\nNu‘mán, is at once a justification and an appeal for mercy[246]:--\r\n\r\n  \"They brought me word, O King, thou blamedst me;\r\n  For this am I o'erwhelmed with grief and care.\r\n  I passed a sick man's night: the nurses seemed,\r\n  Spreading my couch, to have heaped up briars there.\r\n  Now (lest thou cherish in thy mind a doubt)\r\n  Invoking our last refuge, God, I swear\r\n  That he, whoever told thee I was false,\r\n  Is the more lying and faithless of the pair.\r\n  Exiled perforce, I found a strip of land\r\n  Where I could live and safely take the air:\r\n  Kings made me arbiter of their possessions,\r\n  And called me to their side and spoke me fair--\r\n  Even as thou dost grace thy favourites\r\n  Nor deem'st a fault the gratitude they bear.[247]\r\n  O leave thine anger! Else, in view of men\r\n  A mangy camel, smeared with pitch, I were.\r\n  Seest thou not God hath given thee eminence\r\n  Before which monarchs tremble and despair?\r\n  All other kings are stars and thou a sun:\r\n  When the sun rises, lo, the heavens are bare!\r\n  A friend in trouble thou wilt not forsake;\r\n  I may have sinned: in sinning all men share.\r\n  If I am wronged, thou hast but wronged a slave,\r\n  And if thou spar'st, 'tis like thyself to spare.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to record that Nábigha was finally reconciled to the\r\nprince whom he loved, and that Ḥíra again became his home. The date\r\nof his death is unknown, but it certainly took place before Islam was\r\npromulgated. Had the opportunity been granted to him he might have died\r\na Moslem: he calls himself 'a religious man' (_dhú ummatin_),[248] and\r\nalthough the tradition that he was actually a Christian lacks authority,\r\nhis long residence in Syria and ‘Iráq must have made him acquainted with\r\nthe externals of Christianity and with some, at least, of its leading\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A‘shá.]\r\n\r\nThe grave and earnest tone characteristic of Nábigha's poetry seldom\r\nprevails in that of his younger contemporary, Maymún b. Qays, who is\r\ngenerally known by his surname, al-A‘shá--that is, 'the man of weak\r\nsight.' A professional troubadour, he roamed from one end of Arabia to\r\nthe other, harp in hand, singing the praises of those who rewarded him;\r\nand such was his fame as a satirist that few ventured to withhold the\r\nbounty which he asked. By common consent he stands in the very first\r\nrank of Arabian poets. Abu ’l-Faraj, the author of the _Kitábu\r\n’l-Aghání_, declares him to be superior to all the rest, adding,\r\nhowever, \"this opinion is not held unanimously as regards A‘shá or any\r\nother.\" His wandering life brought him into contact with every kind of\r\nculture then existing in Arabia. Although he was not an avowed\r\nChristian, his poetry shows to what an extent he was influenced by the\r\nBishops of Najrán, with whom he was intimately connected, and by the\r\nChristian merchants of Ḥíra who sold him their wine. He did not rise\r\nabove the pagan level of morality.\r\n\r\n  It is related that he set out to visit Muḥammad for the purpose\r\n  of reciting to him an ode which he had composed in his honour. When\r\n  the Quraysh heard of this, they feared lest their adversary's\r\n  reputation should be increased by the panegyric of a bard so famous\r\n  and popular. Accordingly, they intercepted him on his way, and asked\r\n  whither he was bound. \"To your kinsman,\" said he, \"that I may accept\r\n  Islam.\" \"He will forbid and make unlawful to thee certain practices\r\n  of which thou art fond.\" \"What are these?\" said A‘shá.\r\n  \"Fornication,\" said Abú Sufyán, \"I have not abandoned it,\" he\r\n  replied, \"but it has abandoned me. What else?\" \"Gambling.\" \"Perhaps\r\n  I shall obtain from him something to compensate me for the loss of\r\n  gambling. What else?\" \"Usury.\" \"I have never borrowed nor lent. What\r\n  else?\" \"Wine.\" \"Oh, in that case I will drink the water I have left\r\n  stored at al-Mihrás.\" Seeing that A‘shá was not to be deterred, Abú\r\n  Sufyán offered him a hundred camels on condition that he should\r\n  return to his home in Yamáma and await the issue of the struggle\r\n  between Muḥammad and the Quraysh. \"I agree,\" said A‘shá. \"O ye\r\n  Quraysh,\" cried Abú Sufyán, \"this is A‘shá, and by God, if he\r\n  becomes a follower of Muḥammad, he will inflame the Arabs against\r\n  you by his poetry. Collect, therefore, a hundred camels for\r\n  him.\"[249]\r\n\r\nA‘shá excels in the description of wine and wine-parties. One who\r\nvisited Manfúḥa in Yamáma, where the poet was buried, relates that\r\nrevellers used to meet at his grave and pour out beside it the last\r\ndrops that remained in their cups. As an example of his style in this\r\n_genre_ I translate a few lines from the most celebrated of his poems,\r\nwhich is included by some critics among the _Mu‘allaqát_:--\r\n\r\n \"Many a time I hastened early to the tavern--while there ran\r\n  At my heels a ready cook, a nimble, active serving-man--\r\n  'Midst a gallant troop, like Indian scimitars, of mettle high;\r\n  Well they know that every mortal, shod and bare alike, must die.\r\n  Propped at ease I greet them gaily, them with myrtle-boughs I greet,\r\n  Pass among them wine that gushes from the jar's mouth bittersweet.\r\n  Emptying goblet after goblet--but the source may no man drain--\r\n  Never cease they from carousing save to cry, 'Fill up again!'\r\n  Briskly runs the page to serve them: on his ears hang pearls: below,\r\n  Tight the girdle draws his doublet as he bustles to and fro.\r\n  'Twas the harp, thou mightest fancy, waked the lute's responsive note,\r\n  When the loose-robed chantress touched it and sang shrill with\r\n    quavering throat.\r\n  Here and there among the party damsels fair superbly glide:\r\n  Each her long white skirt lets trail and swings a wine-skin at her\r\n    side.\"[250]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Alqama.]\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the life of ‘Alqama b. ‘Abada, who was surnamed\r\n_al-Faḥl_ (the Stallion). His most famous poem is that which he\r\naddressed to the Ghassánid Ḥárith al-A‘raj after the Battle of\r\nḤalíma, imploring him to set free some prisoners of Tamím--the poet's\r\ntribe--among whom was his own brother or nephew, Shás. The following\r\nlines have almost become proverbial:--\r\n\r\n  \"Of women do ye ask me? I can spy\r\n  Their ailments with a shrewd physician's eye.\r\n  The man whose head is grey or small his herds\r\n  No favour wins of them but mocking words.\r\n  Are riches known, to riches they aspire,\r\n  And youthful bloom is still their heart's desire.\"[251]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elegiac poetry.]\r\n\r\nIn view of these slighting verses it is proper to observe that the\r\npoetry of Arabian women of the Pre-islamic period is distinctly\r\nmasculine in character. Their songs are seldom of Love, but often of\r\nDeath. Elegy (_rithá_ or _marthiya_) was regarded as their special\r\nprovince. The oldest form of elegy appears in the verses chanted on the\r\ndeath of Ta’abbaṭa Sharran by his sister:--\r\n\r\n \"O the good knight ye left low at Rakhmán,\r\n  Thábit son of Jábir son of Sufyán!\r\n  He filled the cup for friends and ever slew his man.\"[252]\r\n\r\n\"As a rule the Arabian dirge is very simple. The poetess begins with a\r\ndescription of her grief, of the tears that she cannot quench, and then\r\nshe shows how worthy to be deeply mourned was he whom death has taken\r\naway. He is described as a pattern of the two principal Arabian virtues,\r\nbravery and liberality, and the question is anxiously asked, 'Who will\r\nnow make high resolves, overthrow the enemy, and in time of want feed\r\nthe poor and entertain the stranger?' If the hero of the dirge died a\r\nviolent death we find in addition a burning lust of revenge, a thirst\r\nfor the slayer's blood, expressed with an intensity of feeling of which\r\nonly women are capable.\"[253]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Khansá.]\r\n\r\nAmong Arabian women who have excelled in poetry the place of honour is\r\ndue to Khansá--her real name was Tumáḍir--who flourished in the last\r\nyears before Islam. By far the most famous of her elegies are those in\r\nwhich she bewailed her valiant brothers, Mu‘áwiya and Ṣakhr, both of\r\nwhom were struck down by sword or spear. It is impossible to translate\r\nthe poignant and vivid emotion, the energy of passion and noble\r\nsimplicity of style which distinguish the poetry of Khansá, but here are\r\na few verses:--\r\n\r\n  Death's messenger cried aloud the loss of the generous one,\r\n  So loud cried he, by my life, that far he was heard and wide.\r\n  Then rose I, and scarce my soul could follow to meet the news,\r\n  For anguish and sore dismay and horror that Ṣakhr had died.\r\n  In my misery and despair I seemed as a drunken man,\r\n  Upstanding awhile--then soon his tottering limbs subside.\"[254]\r\n\r\n _Yudhakkiruní ṭulú‘u ’l-shamsi Ṣakhran\r\n  wa-adhkuruhú likulli ghurúbi shamsi._\r\n\r\n \"Sunrise awakes in me the sad remembrance\r\n  Of Ṣakhr, and I recall him at every sunset.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The last poets born in the Age of Paganism.]\r\n\r\nTo the poets who have been enumerated many might be added--_e.g._,\r\nḤassán b. Thábit, who was 'retained' by the Prophet and did useful\r\nwork on his behalf; Ka‘b b. Zuhayr, author or the famous panegyric on\r\nMuḥammad beginning \"_Bánat Su‘ád_\" (Su‘ád has departed); Mutammim b.\r\nNuwayra, who, like Khansá, mourned the loss of a brother; Abú Miḥjan,\r\nthe singer of wine, whose devotion to the forbidden beverage was\r\npunished by the Caliph ‘Umar with imprisonment and exile; and\r\nal-Ḥuṭay’a (the Dwarf), who was unrivalled in satire. All these\r\nbelonged to the class of _Mukhaḍramún_, _i.e._, they were born in the\r\nPagan Age but died, if not Moslems, at any rate after the proclamation\r\nof Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collections of ancient poetry.]\r\n\r\nThe grammarians of Baṣra and Kúfa, by whom the remains of ancient\r\nArabian poetry were rescued from oblivion, arranged and collected their\r\nmaterial according to various principles. Either the poems of an\r\nindividual or those of a number of individuals belonging to the same\r\ntribe or class were brought together--such a collection was called\r\n_Díwán_, plural _Dawáwín_; or, again, the compiler edited a certain\r\nnumber of _qaṣídas_ chosen for their fame or excellence or on other\r\ngrounds, or he formed an anthology of shorter pieces or fragments, which\r\nwere arranged under different heads according to their subject-matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Díwáns.]\r\n\r\nAmong _Díwáns_ mention may be made of _The Díwáns of the Six Poets_,\r\nviz. Nábigha, ‘Antara, Ṭarafa, Zuhayr, ‘Alqama, and Imru’u ’l-Qays,\r\nedited with a full commentary by the Spanish philologist al-A‘lam\r\n(† 1083 A.D.) and published in 1870 by Ahlwardt; and of _The Poems of the\r\nHudhaylites_ (_Ash‘áru ’l-Hudhaliyyín_) collected by al-Sukkarí\r\n(† 888 A.D.), which have been published by Kosegarten and Wellhausen.\r\n\r\nThe chief Anthologies, taken in the order of their composition, are:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anthologies. 1. The _Mu‘allaqát_.]\r\n\r\n1. The _Mu‘allaqát_, which is the title given to a collection of seven\r\nodes by Imru’u ’l-Qays, Ṭarafa, Zuhayr, Labíd, ‘Antara, ‘Amr b.\r\nKulthúm, and Ḥárith b. Ḥilliza; to these two odes by Nábigha and\r\nA‘shá are sometimes added. The compiler was probably Ḥammád\r\nal-Ráwiya, a famous rhapsodist of Persian descent, who flourished under\r\nthe Umayyads and died in the second half of the eighth century of our\r\nera. As the _Mu‘allaqát_ have been discussed above, we may pass on\r\ndirectly to a much larger, though less celebrated, collection dating\r\nfrom the same period, viz.:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. The _Mufaḍḍaliyyát_.]\r\n\r\n2. The _Mufaḍḍaliyyát_,[255] by which title it is generally known\r\nafter its compiler, Mufaḍḍal al-Ḑabbí († circa 786 A.D.), who\r\nmade it at the instance of the Caliph Manṣúr for the instruction of\r\nhis son and successor, Mahdí. It comprises 128 odes and is extant in two\r\nrecensions, that of Anbárí († 916 A.D.), which derives from Ibnu\r\n’l-A‘rábí, the stepson of Mufaḍḍal, and that of Marzúqí († 1030\r\nA.D.). About a third of the _Mufaḍḍaliyyát_ was published in 1885\r\nby Thorbecke, and Sir Charles Lyall has recently edited the complete\r\ntext with Arabic commentary and English translation and notes.[256]\r\n\r\nAll students of Arabian poetry are familiar with--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. The _Ḥamása_ of Abú Tammám.]\r\n\r\n3. The _Ḥamása_ of Abú Tammám Ḥabíb b. Aws, himself a\r\ndistinguished poet, who flourished under the Caliphs Ma’mún and\r\nMu‘taṣim, and died about 850 A.D. Towards the end of his life he\r\nvisited ‘Abdulláh b. Ṭáhir, the powerful governor of Khurásán, who\r\nwas virtually an independent sovereign. It was on this journey, as Ibn\r\nKhallikán relates, that Abú Tammám composed the _Ḥamása_; for on\r\narriving at Hamadhán (Ecbatana) the winter had set in, and as the cold\r\nwas excessively severe in that country, the snow blocked up the road and\r\nobliged him to stop and await the thaw. During his stay he resided with\r\none of the most eminent men of the place, who possessed a library in\r\nwhich were some collections of poems composed by the Arabs of the desert\r\nand other authors. Having then sufficient leisure, he perused those\r\nworks and selected from them the passages out of which he formed his\r\n_Ḥamása_.[257] The work is divided into ten sections of unequal\r\nlength, the first, from which it received its name, occupying (together\r\nwith the commentary) 360 pages in Freytag's edition, while the seventh\r\nand eighth require only thirteen pages between them. These sections or\r\nchapters bear the following titles:--\r\n\r\n     I. The Chapter of Fortitude (_Bábu ’l-Ḥamása_).\r\n    II. The Chapter of Dirges (_Bábu ’l-Maráthí_).\r\n   III. The Chapter of Good Manners (_Bábu ’l-Adab_).\r\n    IV. The Chapter of Love-Songs (_Bábu ’l-Nasíb_).\r\n     V. The Chapter of Satire (_Bábu ’l-Hijá_).\r\n    VI. The Chapter of Guests (Hospitality) and Panegyric (_Bábu\r\n          ’l-Aḍyáf wa ’l-Madíh_).\r\n   VII. The Chapter of Descriptions (_Bábu ’l-Ṣifát_).\r\n  VIII. The Chapter of Travel and Repose (_Bábu ’l-Sayr wa ’l-Nu‘ás_).\r\n    IX. The Chapter of Facetiæ (_Bábu ’l-Mulaḥ_).\r\n     X. The Chapter of Vituperation of Women (_Bábu Madhammati\r\n         ’l-Nisá_).\r\n\r\nThe contents of the _Ḥamása_ include short poems complete in\r\nthemselves as well as passages extracted from longer poems; of the poets\r\nrepresented, some of whom belong to the Pre-islamic and others to the\r\nearly Islamic period, comparatively few are celebrated, while many are\r\nanonymous or only known by the verses attached to their names. If the\r\nhigh level of excellence attained by these obscure singers shows, on the\r\none hand, that a natural genius for poetry was widely diffused and that\r\nthe art was successfully cultivated among all ranks of Arabian society,\r\nwe must not forget how much is due to the fine taste of Abú Tammám, who,\r\nas the commentator Tibrízí has remarked, \"is a better poet in his\r\n_Ḥamása_ than in his poetry.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. The _Ḥamása_ of Buḥturí.]\r\n\r\n4. The _Ḥamása_ of Buḥturí († 897 A.D.), a younger contemporary of\r\nAbú Tammám, is inferior to its model.[258] However convenient from a\r\npractical standpoint, the division into a great number of sections, each\r\nillustrating a narrowly defined topic, seriously impairs the artistic\r\nvalue of the work; moreover, Buḥturí seems to have had a less\r\ncatholic appreciation of the beauties of poetry--he admired, it is said,\r\nonly what was in harmony with his own style and ideas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5. The _Jamhara_.]\r\n\r\n5. The _Jamharatu Ash‘ári ’l-‘Arab_, a collection of forty-nine odes,\r\nwas put together probably about 1000 A.D. by Abú Zayd Muḥammad\r\nal-Qurashí, of whom we find no mention elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prose sources.]\r\n\r\nApart from the _Díwáns_ and anthologies, numerous Pre-islamic verses are\r\ncited in biographical, philological, and other works, _e.g._, the\r\n_Kitábu ’l-Aghání_ by Abu ’l-Faraj of Iṣfahán († 967 _A.D._), the\r\n_Kitábu ’l-Amálí_ by Abú ‘Alí al-Qálí († 967 _A.D._), the _Kámil_ of\r\nMubarrad († 898 A.D.), and the _Khizánatu ’l-Adab_ of ‘Abdu ’l-Qádir of\r\nBaghdád († 1682 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tradition of Pre-islamic poetry.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ráwís.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Humanists.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the oldest existing poems date from the beginning of\r\nthe sixth century of our era, whereas the art of writing did not come\r\ninto general use among the Arabs until some two hundred years\r\nafterwards. Pre-islamic poetry, therefore, was preserved by oral\r\ntradition alone, and the question arises, How was this possible? What\r\nguarantee have we that songs living on men's lips for so long a period\r\nhave retained their original form, even approximately? No doubt many\r\nverses, _e.g._, those which glorified the poet's tribe or satirised\r\ntheir enemies, were constantly being recited by his kin, and in this way\r\nshort occasional poems or fragments of longer ones might be perpetuated.\r\nOf whole _qaṣídas_ like the _Mu‘allaqát_, however, none or very few\r\nwould have reached us if their survival had depended solely on their\r\npopularity. What actually saved them in the first place was an\r\ninstitution resembling that of the Rhapsodists in Greece. Every\r\nprofessed poet had his _Ráwí_ (reciter), who accompanied him everywhere,\r\ncommitted his poems to memory, and handed them down, as well as the\r\ncircumstances connected with them, to others. The characters of poet and\r\n_ráwí_ were often combined; thus Zuhayr was the _ráwí_ of his stepfather,\r\nAws b. Ḥajar, while his own _ráwí_ was al-Ḥuṭay’a. If the\r\ntradition of poetry was at first a labour of love, it afterwards became\r\na lucrative business, and the _Ráwís_, instead of being attached to\r\nindividual poets, began to form an independent class, carrying in their\r\nmemories a prodigious stock of ancient verse and miscellaneous learning.\r\nIt is related, for example, that Ḥammád once said to the Caliph Walíd\r\nb. Yazíd: \"I can recite to you, for each letter of the alphabet, one\r\nhundred long poems rhyming in that letter, without taking into count the\r\nshort pieces, and all that composed exclusively by poets who lived\r\nbefore the promulgation of Islamism.\" He commenced and continued until\r\nthe Caliph, having grown fatigued, withdrew, after leaving a person in\r\nhis place to verify the assertion and hear him to the last. In that\r\nsitting he recited two thousand nine hundred _qaṣídas_ by poets who\r\nflourished before Muḥammad. Walíd, on being informed of the fact,\r\nordered him a present of one hundred thousand dirhems.[259] Thus,\r\ntowards the end of the first century after the Hijra, _i.e._, about 700\r\nA.D., when the custom of _writing_ poetry began, there was much of\r\nPre-islamic origin still in circulation, although it is probable that\r\nfar more had already been irretrievably lost. Numbers of _Ráwís_\r\nperished in the wars, or passed away in the course of nature, without\r\nleaving any one to continue their tradition. New times had brought new\r\ninterests and other ways of life. The great majority of Moslems had no\r\nsympathy whatever with the ancient poetry, which represented in their\r\neyes the unregenerate spirit of heathendom. They wanted nothing beyond\r\nthe Koran and the Ḥadíth. But for reasons which will be stated in\r\nanother chapter the language of the Koran and the Ḥadíth was rapidly\r\nbecoming obsolete as a spoken idiom outside of the Arabian peninsula:\r\nthe 'perspicuous Arabic' on which Muḥammad prided himself had ceased\r\nto be fully intelligible to the Moslems settled in ‘Iráq and Khurásán,\r\nin Syria, and in Egypt. It was essential that the Sacred Text should be\r\nexplained, and this necessity gave birth to the sciences of Grammar and\r\nLexicography. The Philologists, or, as they have been aptly designated,\r\nthe Humanists of Baṣra and Kúfa, where these studies were prosecuted\r\nwith peculiar zeal, naturally found their best material in the\r\nPre-islamic poems--a well of Arabic undefiled. At first the ancient\r\npoetry merely formed a basis for philological research, but in process\r\nof time a literary enthusiasm was awakened. The surviving _Ráwís_ were\r\neagerly sought out and induced to yield up their stores, the\r\ncompositions of famous poets were collected, arranged, and committed to\r\nwriting, and as the demand increased, so did the supply.[260]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corrupt tradition of the old poetry.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥammád al-Ráwiya.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Khalaf al-Aḥmar.]\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances a certain amount of error was inevitable. Apart\r\nfrom unconscious failings of memory, there can be no doubt that in many\r\ncases the _Ráwís_ acted with intent to deceive. The temptation to father\r\ntheir own verses, or centos which they pieced together from sources\r\nknown only to themselves, upon some poet of antiquity was all the\r\nstronger because they ran little risk of detection. In knowledge of\r\npoetry and in poetical talent they were generally far more than a match\r\nfor the philologists, who seldom possessed any critical ability, but\r\nreadily took whatever came to hand. The stories which are told of Ḥammád\r\nal-Ráwiya, clearly show how unscrupulous he was in his methods, though\r\nwe have reason to suppose that he was not a typical example of his\r\nclass. His contemporary, Mufaḍḍal al-Ḑabbí, is reported to have said\r\nthat the corruption which poetry suffered through Ḥammád could never be\r\nrepaired, \"for,\" he added, \"Ḥammád is a man skilled in the language and\r\npoesy of the Arabs and in the styles and ideas of the poets, and he is\r\nalways making verses in imitation of some one and introducing them into\r\ngenuine compositions by the same author, so that the copy passes\r\neverywhere for part of the original, and cannot be distinguished from it\r\nexcept by critical scholars--and where are such to be found?\"[261] This\r\nart of forgery was brought to perfection by Khalaf al-Aḥmar († about 800\r\nA.D.), who learned it in the school of Ḥammád. If he really composed the\r\nfamous _Lámiyya_ ascribed to Shanfará, his own poetical endowments must\r\nhave been of the highest order. In his old age he repented and confessed\r\nthat he was the author of several poems which the scholars of Baṣra and\r\nKúfa had accepted as genuine, but they laughed him to scorn, saying,\r\n\"What you said then seems to us more trustworthy than your present\r\nassertion.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other causes of corruption.]\r\n\r\nBesides the corruptions due to the _Ráwís_, others have been accumulated\r\nby the philologists themselves. As the Koran and the Ḥadíth were, of\r\ncourse, spoken and afterwards written in the dialect of Quraysh, to whom\r\nMuḥammad belonged, this dialect was regarded as the classical\r\nstandard;[262] consequently the variations therefrom which occurred in\r\nthe ancient poems were, for the most part, 'emended' and harmonised with\r\nit. Many changes were made under the influence of Islam, _e.g._, 'Allah'\r\nwas probably often substituted for the pagan goddess 'al-Lát.' Moreover,\r\nthe structure of the _qaṣída_, its disconnectedness and want of logical\r\ncohesion, favoured the omission and transposition of whole passages or\r\nsingle verses. All these modes of depravation might be illustrated in\r\ndetail, but from what has been said the reader can judge for himself how\r\nfar the poems, as they now stand, are likely to have retained the form\r\nin which they were first uttered to the wild Arabs of the Pre-islamic\r\nAge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fair of ‘Ukáẓ.]\r\n\r\nReligion had so little influence on the lives of the Pre-islamic Arabs\r\nthat we cannot expect to find much trace of it in their poetry. They\r\nbelieved vaguely in a supreme God, Allah, and more definitely in his\r\nthree daughters--al-Lát, Manát, and al-‘Uzzá--who were venerated all\r\nover Arabia and whose intercession was graciously accepted by Allah.\r\nThere were also numerous idols enjoying high favour while they continued\r\nto bring good luck to their worshippers. Of real piety the ordinary\r\nBedouin knew nothing. He felt no call to pray to his gods, although he\r\noften found them convenient to swear by. He might invoke Allah in the\r\nhour of need, as a drowning man will clutch at a straw; but his faith in\r\nsuperstitious ceremonies was stronger. He did not take his religion too\r\nseriously. Its practical advantages he was quick to appreciate. Not to\r\nmention baser pleasures, it gave him rest and security during the four\r\nsacred months, in which war was forbidden, while the institution of the\r\nMeccan Pilgrimage enabled him to take part in a national fête. Commerce\r\nwent hand in hand with religion. Great fairs were held, the most famous\r\nbeing that of ‘Ukáẓ, which lasted for twenty days. These fairs were in\r\nsome sort the centre of old Arabian social, political, and literary\r\nlife. It was the only occasion on which free and fearless intercourse\r\nwas possible between the members of different clans.[263]\r\n\r\nPlenty of excitement was provided by poetical and oratorical\r\ndisplays--not by athletic sports, as in ancient Greece and modern\r\nEngland. Here rival poets declaimed their verses and submitted them to\r\nthe judgment of an acknowledged master. Nowhere else had rising talents\r\nsuch an opportunity of gaining wide reputation: what ‘Ukáẓ said to-day\r\nall Arabia would repeat to-morrow. At ‘Ukáẓ, we are told, the youthful\r\nMuḥammad listened, as though spellbound, to the persuasive eloquence of\r\nQuss b. Sá‘ida, Bishop of Najrán; and he may have contrasted the\r\ndiscourse of the Christian preacher with the brilliant odes chanted by\r\nheathen bards.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin view of life was thoroughly hedonistic. Love, wine,\r\ngambling, hunting, the pleasures of song and romance, the brief,\r\npointed, and elegant expression of wit and wisdom--these things he knew\r\nto be good. Beyond them he saw only the grave.\r\n\r\n  \"Roast meat and wine: the swinging ride\r\n  On a camel sure and tried,\r\n  Which her master speeds amain\r\n  O'er low dale and level plain:\r\n  Women marble-white and fair\r\n  Trailing gold-fringed raiment rare:\r\n  Opulence, luxurious ease,\r\n  With the lute's soft melodies--\r\n  Such delights hath our brief span;\r\n  Time is Change, Time's fool is Man.\r\n  Wealth or want, great store or small,\r\n  All is one since Death's are all.\"[264]\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that these men always, or even\r\ngenerally, passed their lives in the aimless pursuit of pleasure. Some\r\ngoal they had--earthly, no doubt--such as the accumulation of wealth or\r\nthe winning of glory or the fulfilment of blood-revenge. \"_God forbid_\"\r\nsays one, \"_that I should die while a grievous longing, as it were a\r\nmountain, weighs on my breast!_\"[265] A deeper chord is touched by\r\nImru’u ’l-Qays: \"_If I strove for a bare livelihood, scanty means would\r\nsuffice me and I would seek no more. But I strive for lasting renown,\r\nand 'tis men like me that sometimes attain lasting renown. Never, while\r\nlife endures, does a man reach the summit of his ambition or cease from\r\ntoil._\"[266]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judaism and Christianity in Arabia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Ibád of Ḥíra.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Adí b. Zayd.]\r\n\r\nThese are noble sentiments nobly expressed. Yet one hears the sigh of\r\nweariness, as if the speaker were struggling against the conviction that\r\nhis cause is already lost, and would welcome the final stroke of\r\ndestiny. It was a time of wild uproar and confusion. Tribal and family\r\nfeuds filled the land, as Zuhayr says, with evil fumes. No wonder that\r\nearnest and thoughtful minds asked themselves--What worth has our life,\r\nwhat meaning? Whither does it lead? Such questions paganism could not\r\nanswer, but Arabia in the century before Muḥammad was not wholly\r\nabandoned to paganism. Jewish colonists had long been settled in the\r\nḤijáz. Probably the earliest settlements date from the conquest of\r\nPalestine by Titus or Hadrian. In their new home the refugees, through\r\ncontact with a people nearly akin to themselves, became fully\r\nArabicised, as the few extant specimens of their poetry bear witness.\r\nThey remained Jews, however, not only in their cultivation of trade and\r\nvarious industries, but also in the most vital particular--their\r\nreligion. This, and the fact that they lived in isolated communities\r\namong the surrounding population, marked them out as the salt of the\r\ndesert. In the Ḥijáz their spiritual predominance was not seriously\r\nchallenged. It was otherwise in Yemen. We may leave out of account the\r\nlegend according to which Judaism was introduced into that country from\r\nthe Ḥijáz by the Tubba‘ As‘ad Kámil. What is certain is that towards the\r\nbeginning of the sixth century it was firmly planted there side by side\r\nwith Christianity, and that in the person of the Ḥimyarite monarch Dhú\r\nNuwás, who adopted the Jewish faith, it won a short-lived but sanguinary\r\ntriumph over its rival. But in Yemen, except among the highlanders of\r\nNajrán, Christianity does not appear to have flourished as it did in the\r\nextreme north and north-east, where the Roman and Persian frontiers were\r\nguarded by the Arab levies of Ghassán and Ḥíra. We have seen that the\r\nlatter city contained a large Christian population who were called\r\ndistinctively ‘Ibád, _i.e._, Servants (of God). Through them the Aramaic\r\nculture of Babylonia was transmitted to all parts of the peninsula. They\r\nhad learned the art of writing long before it was generally practised in\r\nArabia, as is shown by the story of Ṭarafa and Mutalammis, and they\r\nproduced the oldest _written_ poetry in the Arabic language--a poetry\r\nvery different in character from that which forms the main subject of\r\nthis chapter. Unfortunately the bulk of it has perished, since the\r\nrhapsodists, to whom we owe the preservation of so much Pre-islamic\r\nverse, were devoted to the traditional models and would not burden their\r\nmemories with anything new-fashioned. The most famous of the ‘Ibádí\r\npoets is ‘Adí b. Zayd, whose adventurous career as a politician has been\r\nsketched above. He is not reckoned by Muḥammadan critics among the\r\n_Fuḥúl_ or poets of the first rank, because he was a townsman\r\n(_qarawí_). In this connection the following anecdote is instructive.\r\nThe poet al-‘Ajjáj († about 709 A.D.) said of his contemporaries\r\nal-Ṭirimmáḥ and al-Kumayt: \"They used to ask me concerning rare\r\nexpressions in the language of poetry, and I informed them, but\r\nafterwards I found the same expressions wrongly applied in their poems,\r\nthe reason being that they were townsmen who described what they had not\r\nseen and misapplied it, whereas I who am a Bedouin describe what I have\r\nseen and apply it properly.\"[267] ‘Adí is chiefly remembered for his\r\nwine-songs. Oriental Christianity has always been associated with the\r\ndrinking and selling of wine. Christian ideas were carried into the\r\nheart of Arabia by ‘Ibádí wine merchants, who are said to have taught\r\ntheir religion to the celebrated A‘shá. ‘Adí drank and was merry like\r\nthe rest, but the underlying thought, 'for to-morrow we die,' repeatedly\r\nmakes itself heard. He walks beside a cemetery, and the voices of the\r\ndead call to him--[268]\r\n\r\n \"Thou who seest us unto thyself shalt say,\r\n  'Soon upon me comes the season of decay.'\r\n  Can the solid mountains evermore sustain\r\n  Time's vicissitudes and all they bring in train?\r\n  Many a traveller lighted near us and abode,\r\n  Quaffing wine wherein the purest water flowed--\r\n  Strainers on each flagon's mouth to clear the wine,\r\n  Noble steeds that paw the earth in trappings fine!\r\n  For a while they lived in lap of luxury,\r\n  Fearing no misfortune, dallying lazily.\r\n  Then, behold, Time swept them all, like chaff, away:\r\n  Thus it is men fall to whirling Time a prey.\r\n  Thus it is Time keeps the bravest and the best\r\n  Night and day still plunged in Pleasure's fatal quest.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that the recitation of these verses induced Nu‘mán al-Akbar,\r\none of the mythical pagan kings of Ḥíra, to accept Christianity and\r\nbecome an anchorite. Although the story involves an absurd anachronism,\r\nit is _ben trovato_ in so far as it records the impression which the\r\ngraver sort of Christian poetry was likely to make on heathen minds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pre-Islamic poetry not exclusively pagan in sentiment.]\r\n\r\nThe courts of Ḥíra and Ghassán were well known to the wandering\r\nminstrels of the time before Muḥammad, who flocked thither in eager\r\nsearch of patronage and remuneration. We may be sure that men like\r\nNábigha, Labíd, and A‘shá did not remain unaffected by the culture\r\naround them, even if it seldom entered very deeply into their lives.\r\nThat considerable traces of religious feeling are to be found in\r\nPre-islamic poetry admits of no denial, but the passages in question\r\nwere formerly explained as due to interpolation. This view no longer\r\nprevails. Thanks mainly to the arguments of Von Kremer, Sir Charles\r\nLyall, and Wellhausen, it has come to be recognised (1) that in many\r\ncases the above-mentioned religious feeling is not Islamic in tone; (2)\r\nthat the passages in which it occurs are not of Islamic origin; and (3)\r\nthat it is the natural and necessary result of the widely spread, though\r\non the whole superficial, influence of Judaism, and especially of\r\nChristianity.[269] It shows itself not only in frequent allusions,\r\n_e.g._, to the monk in his solitary cell, whose lamp serves to light\r\nbelated travellers on their way, and in more significant references,\r\nsuch as that of Zuhayr already quoted, to the Heavenly Book in which\r\nevil actions are enscrolled for the Day of Reckoning, but also in the\r\ntendency to moralise, to look within, to meditate on death, and to value\r\nthe life of the individual rather than the continued existence of the\r\nfamily. These things are not characteristic of old Arabian poetry, but\r\nthe fact that they do appear at times is quite in accord with the other\r\nfacts which have been stated, and justifies the conclusion that during\r\nthe sixth century religion and culture were imperceptibly extending\r\ntheir sphere of influence in Arabia, leavening the pagan masses, and\r\ngradually preparing the way for Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PROPHET AND THE KORAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of Muḥammad the almost impenetrable veil thrown over\r\nthe preceding age is suddenly lifted and we find ourselves on the solid\r\nground of historical tradition. In order that the reasons for this\r\nchange may be understood, it is necessary to give some account of the\r\nprincipal sources from which our knowledge of the Prophet's life and\r\nteaching is derived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of information: I. The Koran.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How it was preserved.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of the Koran as an authority.]\r\n\r\nThere is first, of course, the Koran,[270] consisting \"exclusively of\r\nthe revelations or commands which Muḥammad professed, from time to time,\r\nto receive through Gabriel as a message direct from God; and which,\r\nunder an alleged Divine direction, he delivered to those about him. At\r\nthe time of pretended inspiration, or shortly after, each passage was\r\nrecited by Muḥammad before the Companions or followers who happened to\r\nbe present, and was generally committed to writing by some one amongst\r\nthem upon palm-leaves, leather, stones, or such other rude material as\r\nconveniently came to hand. These Divine messages continued throughout\r\nthe three-and-twenty years of his prophetical life, so that the last\r\nportion did not appear till the year of his death. The canon was then\r\nclosed; but the contents were never, during the Prophet's lifetime,\r\nsystematically arranged, or even collected together.\"[271] They were\r\npreserved, however, in fragmentary copies and, especially, by oral\r\nrecitation until the sanguinary wars which followed Muḥammad's death had\r\ngreatly diminished the number of those who could repeat them by heart.\r\nAccordingly, after the battle of Yamáma (633 A.D.) ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭáb\r\ncame to Abú Bakr, who was then Caliph, and said: \"I fear that slaughter\r\nmay wax hot among the Reciters on other battle-fields, and that much of\r\nthe Koran may be lost; so in my opinion it should be collected without\r\ndelay.\" Abú Bakr agreed, and entrusted the task to Zayd b. Thábit, one\r\nof the Prophet's amanuenses, who collected the fragments with great\r\ndifficulty \"from bits of parchment, thin white stones, leafless\r\npalm-branches, and the bosoms of men.\" The manuscript thus compiled was\r\ndeposited with Abú Bakr during the remainder of his life, then with\r\n‘Umar, on whose death it passed to his daughter Ḥafṣa. Afterwards, in\r\nthe Caliphate of ‘Uthmán, Ḥudhayfa b. al-Yamán, observing that the Koran\r\nas read in Syria was seriously at variance with the text current in\r\n‘Iráq, warned the Caliph to interfere, lest the Sacred Book of the\r\nMoslems should become a subject of dispute, like the Jewish and\r\nChristian scriptures. In the year 651 A.D. ‘Uthmán ordered Zayd b.\r\nThábit to prepare a Revised Version with the assistance of three\r\nQurayshites, saying to the latter, \"If ye differ from Zayd regarding any\r\nword of the Koran, write it in the dialect of Quraysh; for it was\r\nrevealed in their dialect.\"[272] This has ever since remained the final\r\nand standard recension of the Koran. \"Transcripts were multiplied and\r\nforwarded to the chief cities in the empire, and all previously existing\r\ncopies were, by the Caliph's command, committed to the flames.\"[273] In\r\nthe text as it has come down to us the various readings are few and\r\nunimportant, and its genuineness is above suspicion. We shall see,\r\nmoreover, that the Koran is an exceedingly human document, reflecting\r\nevery phase of Muḥammad's personality and standing in close relation to\r\nthe outward events of his life, so that here we have materials of unique\r\nand incontestable authority for tracing the origin and early development\r\nof Islam--such materials as do not exist in the case of Buddhism or\r\nChristianity or any other ancient religion. Unfortunately the\r\narrangement of the Koran can only be described as chaotic. No\r\nchronological sequence is observed in the order of the Súras (chapters),\r\nwhich is determined simply by their length, the longest being placed\r\nfirst.[274] Again, the chapters themselves are sometimes made up of\r\ndisconnected fragments having nothing in common except the rhyme; whence\r\nit is often impossible to discover the original context of the words\r\nactually spoken by the Prophet, the occasion on which they were\r\nrevealed, or the period to which they belong. In these circumstances the\r\nKoran must be supplemented by reference to our second main source of\r\ninformation, namely, Tradition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Tradition (Ḥadíth).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biographies of Muḥammad.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General collections.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commentaries on the Koran.]\r\n\r\nAlready in the last years of Muḥammad's life (writes Dr. Sprenger) it\r\nwas a pious custom that when two Moslems met, one should ask for news\r\n(_ḥadíth_) and the other should relate a saying or anecdote of the\r\nProphet. After his death this custom continued, and the name _Ḥadíth_\r\nwas still applied to sayings and stories which were no longer new.[275]\r\nIn the course of time an elaborate system of Tradition was built up, as\r\nthe Koran--originally the sole criterion by which Moslems were guided\r\nalike in the greatest and smallest matters of public and private\r\ninterest--was found insufficient for the complicated needs of a rapidly\r\nextending empire. Appeal was made to the sayings and practice (_sunna_)\r\nof Muḥammad, which now acquired \"the force of law and some of the\r\nauthority of inspiration.\" The Prophet had no Boswell, but almost as\r\nsoon as he began to preach he was a marked man whose _obiter dicta_\r\ncould not fail to be treasured by his Companions, and whose actions were\r\nattentively watched. Thus, during the first century of Islam there was a\r\nmultitude of living witnesses from whom traditions were collected,\r\ncommitted to memory, and orally handed down. Every tradition consists of\r\ntwo parts: the text (_matn_) and the authority (_sanad_, or _isnád_),\r\n_e.g._, the relater says, \"I was told by _A_, who was informed by _B_,\r\nwho had it from _C_, that the Prophet (God bless him!) and Abú Bakr and\r\n‘Umar used to open prayer with the words 'Praise to God, the Lord of all\r\ncreatures.'\" Written records and compilations were comparatively rare in\r\nthe early period. Ibn Isḥáq († 768 A.D.) composed the oldest extant\r\nBiography of the Prophet, which we do not possess, however, in its\r\noriginal shape but only in the recension of Ibn Hishám († 833 A.D.). Two\r\nimportant and excellent works of the same kind are the _Kitábu\r\n’l-Maghází_ ('Book of the Wars') by Wáqidí († 822 A.D.) and the _Kitábu\r\n’l-Ṭabaqát al-Kabír_ ('The Great Book of the Classes,' _i.e._, the\r\ndifferent classes of Muḥammad's Companions and those who came after\r\nthem) by Ibn Sa‘d († 844 A.D.). Of miscellaneous traditions intended to\r\nserve the Faithful as a model and rule of life in every particular, and\r\narranged in chapters according to the subject-matter, the most ancient\r\nand authoritative collections are those of Bukhárí († 870 A.D.) and\r\nMuslim († 874 A.D.), both of which bear the same title, viz.,\r\n_al-Ṣaḥíḥ_, 'The Genuine.' It only remains to speak of Commentaries on\r\nthe Koran. Some passages were explained by Muḥammad himself, but the\r\nreal founder of Koranic Exegesis was ‘Abdulláh b. ‘Abbás, the Prophet's\r\ncousin. Although the writings of the early interpreters have entirely\r\nperished, the gist of their researches is embodied in the great\r\ncommentary of Ṭabarí († 922 A.D.), a man of encyclopædic learning who\r\nabsorbed the whole mass of tradition existing in his time. Subsequent\r\ncommentaries are largely based on this colossal work, which has recently\r\nbeen published at Cairo in thirty volumes. That of Zamakhsharí († 1143\r\nA.D.), which is entitled the _Kashsháf_, and that of Bayḍáwí († 1286\r\nA.D.) are the best known and most highly esteemed in the Muḥammadan\r\nEast. A work of wider scope is the _Itqán_ of Suyúṭí († 1505 A.D.),\r\nwhich takes a general survey of the Koranic sciences, and may be\r\nregarded as an introduction to the critical study of the Koran.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Moslem tradition.]\r\n\r\nWhile every impartial student will admit the justice of Ibn Qutayba's\r\nclaim that no religion has such historical attestations as Islam--_laysa\r\nli-ummatin mina ’l-umami asnádun ka-asnádihim_[276]--he must at the same\r\ntime cordially assent to the observation made by another Muḥammadan: \"In\r\nnothing do we see pious men more given to falsehood than in Tradition\"\r\n(_lam nara ’l-ṣáliḥína? fí shayin akdhaba minhum fi ’l-ḥadíth_).[277] Of\r\nthis severe judgment the reader will find ample confirmation in the\r\nSecond Part of Goldziher's _Muhammedanische Studien_.[278] During the\r\nfirst century of Islam the forging of Traditions became a recognised\r\npolitical and religious weapon, of which all parties availed themselves.\r\nEven men of the strictest piety practised this species of fraud\r\n(_tadlís_), and maintained that the end justified the means. Their point\r\nof view is well expressed in the following words which are supposed to\r\nhave been spoken by the Prophet: \"You must compare the sayings\r\nattributed to me with the Koran; what agrees therewith is from me,\r\nwhether I actually said it or no;\" and again, \"Whatever good saying has\r\nbeen said, I myself have said it.\"[279] As the result of such principles\r\nevery new doctrine took the form of an Apostolic _Ḥadíth_; every sect\r\nand every system defended itself by an appeal to the authority of\r\nMuḥammad. We may see how enormous was the number of false Traditions in\r\ncirculation from the fact that when Bukhárí († 870 A.D.) drew up his\r\ncollection entitled 'The Genuine' (_al-Ṣaḥíḥ_), he limited it to some\r\n7,000, which he picked out of 600,000.\r\n\r\nThe credibility of Tradition, so far as it concerns the life of the\r\nProphet, cannot be discussed in this place.[280] The oldest and best\r\nbiography, that of Ibn Isḥáq, undoubtedly contains a great deal of\r\nfabulous matter, but his narrative appears to be honest and fairly\r\nauthentic on the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth of Muḥammad.]\r\n\r\nIf we accept the traditional chronology, Muḥammad, son of ‘Abdulláh and\r\nÁmina, of the tribe of Quraysh, was born at Mecca on the 12th of Rabí‘\r\nal-Awwal, in the Year of the Elephant (570-571 A.D.). His descent from\r\nQuṣayy is shown by the following table:--\r\n\r\n            Quṣayy.\r\n               │\r\n          ‘Abd Manáf.\r\n               │\r\n      ┌────────┴───────────┐\r\n      │                    │\r\n ‘Abd Shams.            Háshim.\r\n      │                    │\r\n   Umayya.         ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib.\r\n                           │\r\n               ┌───────────+─────────────┐\r\n               │           │             │\r\n            ‘Abbás.   ‘Abdulláh.     Abú Ṭálib.\r\n                           │\r\n                       MUḤAMMAD.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His childhood.]\r\n\r\nShortly after his birth he was handed over to a Bedouin nurse--Ḥalíma, a\r\nwoman of the Banú Sa‘d--so that until he was five years old he breathed\r\nthe pure air and learned to speak the unadulterated language of the\r\ndesert. One marvellous event which is said to have happened to him at\r\nthis time may perhaps be founded on fact:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Muḥammad and the two angels.]\r\n\r\n  \"He and his foster-brother\" (so Ḥalíma relates) \"were among the\r\n  cattle behind our encampment when my son came running to us and\r\n  cried, 'My brother, the Qurayshite! two men clad in white took him\r\n  and laid him on his side and cleft his belly; and they were stirring\r\n  their hands in it.' When my husband and I went out to him we found\r\n  him standing with his face turned pale, and on our asking, 'What\r\n  ails thee, child?' he answered, 'Two men wearing white garments came\r\n  to me and laid me on my side and cleft my belly and groped for\r\n  something, I know not what.' We brought him back to our tent, and my\r\n  husband said to me, 'O Ḥalíma, I fear this lad has been smitten\r\n  (_uṣíba_); so take him home to his family before it becomes\r\n  evident.' When we restored him to his mother she said, 'What has\r\n  brought thee, nurse? Thou wert so fond of him and anxious that he\r\n  should stay with thee.' I said, 'God has made him grow up, and I\r\n  have done my part. I feared that some mischance would befall him, so\r\n  I brought him back to thee as thou wishest.' 'Thy case is not thus,'\r\n  said she; 'tell me the truth,' and she gave me no peace until I told\r\n  her. Then she said, 'Art thou afraid that he is possessed by the\r\n  Devil?' I said, 'Yes.' 'Nay, by God,' she replied, 'the Devil cannot\r\n  reach him; my son hath a high destiny.'\"[281]\r\n\r\nOther versions of the story are more explicit. The angels, it is said,\r\ndrew forth Muḥammad's heart, cleansed it, and removed the black\r\nclot--_i.e_., the taint of original sin.[282] If these inventions have\r\nany basis at all beyond the desire to glorify the future Prophet, we\r\nmust suppose that they refer to some kind of epileptic fit. At a later\r\nperiod he was subject to such attacks, which, according to the unanimous\r\nvoice of Tradition, often coincided with the revelations sent down from\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His meeting with the monk Baḥírá.]\r\n\r\n‘Abdulláh had died before the birth of his son, and when, in his sixth\r\nyear, Muḥammad lost his mother also, the charge of the orphan was\r\nundertaken first by his grandfather, the aged ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib, and\r\nthen by his uncle, Abú Ṭálib, a poor but honourable man, who nobly\r\nfulfilled the duties of a guardian to the last hour of his life.\r\nMuḥammad's small patrimony was soon spent, and he was reduced to herding\r\nsheep--a despised employment which usually fell to the lot of women or\r\nslaves. In his twelfth year he accompanied Abú Ṭálib on a trading\r\nexpedition to Syria, in the course of which he is said to have\r\nencountered a Christian monk called Baḥírá, who discovered the Seal of\r\nProphecy between the boy's shoulders, and hailed him as the promised\r\napostle. Such anticipations deserve no credit whatever. The truth is\r\nthat until Muḥammad assumed the prophetic rôle he was merely an obscure\r\nQurayshite; and scarcely anything related of him anterior to that event\r\ncan be deemed historical except his marriage to Khadíja, an elderly\r\nwidow of considerable fortune, which took place when he was about\r\ntwenty-five years of age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ḥanífs.]\r\n\r\nDuring the next fifteen years of his life Muḥammad was externally a\r\nprosperous citizen, only distinguished from those around him by an\r\nhabitual expression of thoughtful melancholy. What was passing in his\r\nmind may be conjectured with some probability from his first utterances\r\nwhen he came forward as a preacher. It is certain, and he himself has\r\nacknowledged, that he formerly shared the idolatry of his countrymen.\r\n\"_Did not He find thee astray and lead thee aright?_\" (Kor. xciii, 7).\r\nWhen and how did the process of conversion begin? These questions cannot\r\nbe answered, but it is natural to suppose that the all-important result,\r\non which Muḥammad's biographers concentrate their attention, was\r\npreceded by a long period of ferment and immaturity. The idea of\r\nmonotheism was represented in Arabia by the Jews, who were particularly\r\nnumerous in the Ḥijáz, and by several gnostic sects of an ascetic\r\ncharacter--_e.g._, the Ṣábians[283] and the Rakúsians. Furthermore,\r\n\"Islamic tradition knows of a number of religious thinkers before\r\nMuḥammad who are described as Ḥanífs,\"[284] and of whom the best known\r\nare Waraqa b. Nawfal of Quraysh; Zayd b. ‘Amr b. Nufayl, also of\r\nQuraysh; and Umayya b. Abi ’l-Ṣalt of Thaqíf. They formed no sect, as\r\nSprenger imagined; and more recent research has demonstrated the\r\nbaselessness of the same scholar's theory that there was in Pre-islamic\r\ntimes a widely-spread religious movement which Muḥammad organised,\r\ndirected, and employed for his own ends. His Arabian precursors, if they\r\nmay be so called, were merely a few isolated individuals. We are told by\r\nIbn Isḥáq that Waraqa and Zayd, together with two other Qurayshites,\r\nrejected idolatry and left their homes in order to seek the true\r\nreligion of Abraham, but whereas Waraqa is said to have become a\r\nChristian, Zayd remained a pious dissenter unattached either to\r\nChristianity or to Judaism; he abstained from idol-worship, from eating\r\nthat which had died of itself, from blood, and from the flesh of animals\r\noffered in sacrifice to idols; he condemned the barbarous custom of\r\nburying female infants alive, and said, \"I worship the Lord of\r\nAbraham.\"[285] As regards Umayya b. Abi ’l-Ṣalt, according to the notice\r\nof him in the _Aghání_, he had inspected and read the Holy Scriptures;\r\nhe wore sackcloth as a mark of devotion, held wine to be unlawful, was\r\ninclined to disbelieve in idols, and earnestly sought the true religion.\r\nIt is said that he hoped to be sent as a prophet to the Arabs, and\r\ntherefore when Muḥammad appeared he envied and bitterly opposed\r\nhim.[286] Umayya's verses, some of which have been translated in a\r\nformer chapter,[287] are chiefly on religious topics, and show many\r\npoints of resemblance with the doctrines set forth in the early Súras of\r\nthe Koran. With one exception, all the Ḥanífs whose names are recorded\r\nbelonged to the Ḥijáz and the west of the Arabian peninsula. No doubt\r\nMuḥammad, with whom most of them were contemporary, came under their\r\ninfluence, and he may have received his first stimulus from this\r\nquarter.[288] While they, however, were concerned only about their own\r\nsalvation, Muḥammad, starting from the same position, advanced far\r\nbeyond it. His greatness lies not so much in the sublime ideas by which\r\nhe was animated as in the tremendous force and enthusiasm of his appeal\r\nto the universal conscience of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muḥammad's vision.]\r\n\r\nIn his fortieth year, it is said, Muḥammad began to dream dreams and see\r\nvisions, and desire solitude above all things else. He withdrew to a\r\ncave on Mount Ḥirá, near Mecca, and engaged in religious austerities\r\n(_taḥannuth_). One night in the month of Ramaḍán[289] the Angel[290]\r\nappeared to him and said, \"Read!\" (_iqra’_). He answered, \"I am no\r\nreader\" (_má ana bi-qári’in_).[291] Then the Angel seized him with a\r\nstrong grasp, saying, \"Read!\" and, as Muḥammad still refused to obey,\r\ngripped him once more and spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF COAGULATED BLOOD (XCVI).\r\n\r\n  (1) Read in the name of thy Lord[292] who created,\r\n  (2) Who created Man of blood coagulated.\r\n  (3) Read! Thy Lord is the most beneficent,\r\n  (4) Who taught by the Pen,[293]\r\n  (5) Taught that which they knew not unto men.\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words Muḥammad returned, trembling, to Khadíja and\r\ncried, \"Wrap me up! wrap me up!\" and remained covered until the terror\r\npassed away from him.[294] Another tradition relating to the same event\r\nmakes it clear that the revelation occurred in a dream.[295] \"I awoke,\"\r\nsaid the Prophet, \"and methought it was written in my heart.\" If we take\r\ninto account the notions prevalent among the Arabs of that time on the\r\nsubject of inspiration,[296] it will not appear surprising that Muḥammad\r\nat first believed himself to be possessed, like a poet or soothsayer, by\r\none of the spirits called collectively _Jinn_. Such was his anguish of\r\nmind that he even meditated suicide, but Khadíja comforted and reassured\r\nhim, and finally he gained the unalterable conviction that he was not a\r\nprey to demoniacal influences, but a prophet divinely inspired. For some\r\ntime he received no further revelation.[297] Then suddenly, as he\r\nafterwards related, he saw the Angel seated on a throne between earth\r\nand heaven. Awe-stricken, he ran into his house and bade them wrap his\r\nlimbs in a warm garment (_dithár_). While he lay thus the following\r\nverses were revealed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF THE ENWRAPPED (LXXIV).\r\n\r\n  (1) O thou who enwrapped dost lie!\r\n  (2) Arise and prophesy,[298]\r\n  (3) And thy Lord magnify,\r\n  (4) And thy raiment purify,\r\n  (5) And the abomination fly![299]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad no longer doubted that he had a divinely ordained mission to\r\npreach in public. His feelings of relief and thankfulness are expressed\r\nin several Súras of this period, _e.g._--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF THE MORNING (XCIII).\r\n\r\n  (1) By the Morning bright\r\n  (2) And the softly falling Night,\r\n  (3) Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither art thou hateful in\r\n        His sight.\r\n  (4) Verily, the Beginning is hard unto thee, but the End shall be\r\n        light.[300]\r\n  (5) Thou shalt be satisfied, the Lord shall thee requite.\r\n  (6) Did not He shelter thee when He found thee in orphan's plight?\r\n  (7) Did not He find thee astray and lead thee aright?\r\n  (8) Did not He find thee poor and make thee rich by His might?\r\n  (9) Wherefore, the orphan betray not,\r\n (10) And the beggar turn away not,\r\n (11) And tell of the bounty of thy Lord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Moslems.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostility of the Quraysh.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emigration to Abyssinia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary reconciliation with the Quraysh.]\r\n\r\nAccording to his biographers, an interval of three years elapsed between\r\nthe sending of Muḥammad and his appearance as a public preacher of the\r\nfaith that was in him. Naturally, he would first turn to his own family\r\nand friends, but it is difficult to accept the statement that he made no\r\nproselytes openly during so long a period. The contrary is asserted in\r\nan ancient tradition related by al-Zuhrí († 742 A.D.), where we read\r\nthat the Prophet summoned the people to embrace Islam[301] both in\r\nprivate and public; and that those who responded to his appeal were, for\r\nthe most part, young men belonging to the poorer class.[302] He found,\r\nhowever, some influential adherents. Besides Khadíja, who was the first\r\nto believe, there were his cousin ‘Alí, his adopted son, Zayd b.\r\nḤáritha, and, most important of all, Abú Bakr b. Abí Quháfa, a leading\r\nmerchant of the Quraysh, universally respected and beloved for his\r\nintegrity, wisdom, and kindly disposition. At the outset Muḥammad seems\r\nto have avoided everything calculated to offend the heathens, confining\r\nhimself to moral and religious generalities, so that many believed, and\r\nthe Meccan aristocrats themselves regarded him with good-humoured\r\ntoleration as a harmless oracle-monger. \"Look!\" they said as he passed\r\nby, \"there goes the man of the Banú ‘Abd al-Muṭṭalib who tells of\r\nheaven.\" But no sooner did he begin to emphasise the Unity of God, to\r\nfulminate against idolatry, and to preach the Resurrection of the dead,\r\nthan his followers melted away in face of the bitter antagonism which\r\nthese doctrines excited amongst the Quraysh, who saw in the Ka‘ba and\r\nits venerable cult the mainspring of their commercial prosperity, and\r\nwere irritated by the Prophet's declaration that their ancestors were\r\nburning in hell-fire. The authority of Abú Ṭálib secured the personal\r\nsafety of Muḥammad; of the little band who remained faithful some were\r\nprotected by the strong family feeling characteristic of old Arabian\r\nsociety, but many were poor and friendless; and these, especially the\r\nslaves, whom the levelling ideas of Islam had attracted in large\r\nnumbers, were subjected to cruel persecution.[303] Nevertheless Muḥammad\r\ncontinued to preach. \"I will not forsake this cause\" (thus he is said to\r\nhave answered Abú Ṭálib, who informed him of the threatening attitude of\r\nthe Quraysh and begged him not to lay on him a greater burden than he\r\ncould bear) \"until God shall make it prevail or until I shall perish\r\ntherein--not though they should set the sun on my right hand and the\r\nmoon on my left!\"[304] But progress was slow and painful: the Meccans\r\nstood obstinately aloof, deriding both his prophetic authority and the\r\nDivine chastisement with which he sought to terrify them. Moreover, they\r\nused every kind of pressure short of actual violence in order to seduce\r\nhis followers, so that many recanted, and in the fifth year of his\r\nmission he saw himself driven to the necessity of commanding a general\r\nemigration to the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia, where the Moslems\r\nwould be received with open arms[305] and would be withdrawn from\r\ntemptation.[306] About a hundred men and women went into exile, leaving\r\ntheir Prophet with a small party of staunch and devoted comrades to\r\npersevere in a struggle that was daily becoming more difficult. In a\r\nmoment of weakness Muḥammad resolved to attempt a compromise with his\r\ncountrymen. One day, it is said, the chief men of Mecca, assembled in a\r\ngroup beside the Ka‘ba, discussed as was their wont the affairs of the\r\ncity, when Muḥammad appeared and, seating himself by them in a friendly\r\nmanner, began to recite in their hearing the 53rd Súra of the Koran.\r\nWhen he came to the verses (19-20)--\r\n\r\n \"Do ye see Al-Lát and Al-‘Uzzá, and Manát, the third and last?\"\r\n\r\nSatan prompted him to add:--\r\n\r\n \"These are the most exalted Cranes (or Swans),\r\n  And verily their intercession is to be hoped for.\"\r\n\r\nThe Quraysh were surprised and delighted with this acknowledgment of\r\ntheir deities; and as Muḥammad wound up the Súra with the closing\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n  \"Wherefore bow down before God and serve Him,\"\r\n\r\nthe whole assembly prostrated themselves with one accord on the ground\r\nand worshipped.[307] But scarcely had Muḥammad returned to his house\r\nwhen he repented of the sin into which he had fallen. He cancelled the\r\nidolatrous verses and revealed in their place those which now stand in\r\nthe Koran--\r\n\r\n \"Shall yours be the male and his the female?[308]\r\n  This were then an unjust division!\r\n  They are naught but names which ye and your fathers have named.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muḥammad's concession to the idolaters.]\r\n\r\nWe can easily comprehend why Ibn Hishám omits all mention of this\r\nepisode from his Biography, and why the fact itself is denied by many\r\nMoslem theologians.[309] The Prophet's friends were scandalised, his\r\nenemies laughed him to scorn. It was probably no sudden lapse, as\r\ntradition represents, but a calculated endeavour to come to terms with\r\nthe Quraysh; and so far from being immediately annulled, the\r\nreconciliation seems to have lasted long enough for the news of it to\r\nreach the emigrants in Abyssinia and induce some of them to return to\r\nMecca. While putting the best face on the matter, Muḥammad felt keenly\r\nboth his own disgrace and the public discredit. It speaks well for his\r\nsincerity that, as soon as he perceived any compromise with idolatry to\r\nbe impossible--to be, in fact, a surrender of the great principle by\r\nwhich he was inspired--he frankly confessed his error and delusion.\r\nHenceforth he \"wages mortal strife with images in every shape\"--there is\r\nno god but Allah.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Khadíja and Abú Ṭálib.]\r\n\r\nThe further course of events which culminated in Muḥammad's Flight to\r\nMedína may be sketched in a few words. Persecution now waxed hotter than\r\never, as the Prophet, rising from his temporary vacillation like a giant\r\nrefreshed, threw his whole force into the denunciation of idolatry. The\r\nconversion of ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭáb, the future Caliph, a man of 'blood\r\nand iron,' gave the signal for open revolt. \"The Moslems no longer\r\nconcealed their worship within their own dwellings, but with conscious\r\nstrength and defiant attitude assembled in companies about the Ka‘ba,\r\nperformed their rites of prayer and compassed the Holy House. Their\r\ncourage rose. Dread and uneasiness seized the Quraysh.\" The latter\r\nretaliated by cutting off all relations with the Háshimites, who were\r\npledged to defend their kinsman, whether they recognised him as a\r\nprophet or no. This ban or boycott secluded them in an outlying quarter\r\nof the city, where for more than two years they endured the utmost\r\nprivations, but it only cemented their loyalty to Muḥammad, and\r\nultimately dissensions among the Quraysh themselves caused it to be\r\nremoved. Shortly afterwards the Prophet suffered a double\r\nbereavement--the death of his wife, Khadíja, was followed by that of the\r\nnoble Abú Ṭálib, who, though he never accepted Islam, stood firm to the\r\nlast in defence of his brother's son. Left alone to protect himself,\r\nMuḥammad realised that he must take some decisive step. The situation\r\nwas critical. Events had shown that he had nothing to hope and\r\neverything to fear from the Meccan aristocracy. He had warned them again\r\nand again of the wrath to come, yet they gave no heed. He was now\r\nconvinced that they would not and could not believe, since God in His\r\ninscrutable wisdom had predestined them to eternal damnation.\r\nConsequently he resolved on a bold and, according to Arab ways of\r\nthinking, abominable expedient, namely, to abandon his fellow-tribesmen\r\nand seek aid from strangers.[310] Having vainly appealed to the\r\ninhabitants of Ṭá’if, he turned to Medína, where, among a population\r\nlargely composed of Jews, the revolutionary ideas of Islam might more\r\nreadily take root and flourish than in the Holy City of Arabian\r\nheathendom. This time he was not disappointed. A strong party in Medína\r\nhailed him as the true Prophet, eagerly embraced his creed, and swore to\r\ndefend him at all hazards. In the spring of the year 622 A.D. the\r\nMoslems of Mecca quietly left their homes and journeyed northward. A few\r\nmonths later (September, 622) Muḥammad himself, eluding the vigilance of\r\nthe Quraysh, entered Medína in triumph amidst the crowds and\r\nacclamations due to a conqueror.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Hijra_ or Migration to Medina (622 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThis is the celebrated Migration or Hegira (properly _Hijra_) which\r\nmarks the end of the Barbaric Age (_al-Jáhiliyya_) and the beginning of\r\nthe Muḥammadan Era. It also marks a new epoch in the Prophet's history;\r\nbut before attempting to indicate the nature of the change it will be\r\nconvenient, in order that we may form a juster conception of his\r\ncharacter, to give some account of his early teaching and preaching as\r\nset forth in that portion of the Koran which was revealed at Mecca.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Koran.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was Muḥammad poet?]\r\n\r\nKoran (Qur’án) is derived from the Arabic root _qara’a_, 'to read,' and\r\nmeans 'reading aloud' or 'chanting.' This term may be applied either to\r\na single Revelation or to several recited together or, in its usual\r\nacceptation, to the whole body of Revelations which are thought by\r\nMoslems to be, actually and literally, the Word of God; so that in\r\nquoting from the Koran they say _qála ’lláhu_, _i.e._, 'God said.' Each\r\nRevelation forms a separate _Súra_ (chapter)[311] composed of verses of\r\nvarying length which have no metre but are generally rhymed. Thus, as\r\nregards its external features, the style of the Koran is modelled upon\r\nthe _Saj‘_,[312] or rhymed prose, of the pagan soothsayers, but with\r\nsuch freedom that it may fairly be described as original. Since it was\r\nnot in Muḥammad's power to create a form that should be absolutely new,\r\nhis choice lay between _Saj‘_ and poetry, the only forms of elevated\r\nstyle then known to the Arabs. He himself declared that he was no\r\npoet,[313] and this is true in the sense that he may have lacked the\r\ntechnical accomplishment of verse-making. It must, however, be borne in\r\nmind that his disavowal does not refer primarily to the poetic art, but\r\nrather to the person and character of the poets themselves. He, the\r\ndivinely inspired Prophet, could have nothing to do with men who owed\r\ntheir inspiration to demons and gloried in the ideals of paganism which\r\nhe was striving to overthrow. \"_And the poets do those follow who go\r\nastray! Dost thou not see that they wander distraught in every vale? and\r\nthat they say that which they do not?_\" (Kor. xxvi, 224-226). Muḥammad\r\nwas not of these; although he was not so unlike them as he pretended.\r\nHis kinship with the pagan _Shá‘ir_ is clearly shown, for example, in\r\nthe 113th and 114th Súras, which are charms against magic and\r\n_diablerie_, as well as in the solemn imprecation calling down\r\ndestruction upon the head of his uncle, ‘Abdu ’l-‘Uzzá, nicknamed Abú\r\nLahab (Father of Flame).\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF ABÚ LAHAB (CXI).\r\n\r\n  (1) Perish the hands of Abú Lahab and perish he!\r\n  (2) His wealth shall not avail him nor all he hath gotten in fee.\r\n  (3) Burned in blazing fire he shall be!\r\n  (4) And his wife, the faggot-bearer, also she.\r\n  (5) Upon her neck a cord of fibres of the palm-tree.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we must allow that Muḥammad's contemporaries had some\r\njustification for bestowing upon him the title of poet against which he\r\nprotested so vehemently, still less can his plea be accepted by the\r\nmodern critic, whose verdict will be that the Koran is not poetical as a\r\nwhole; that it contains many pages of rhetoric and much undeniable\r\nprose; but that, although Muḥammad needed \"heaven-sent moments for this\r\nskill,\" in the early Meccan Súras frequently, and fitfully elsewhere,\r\nhis genius proclaims itself by grand lyrical outbursts which could never\r\nhave been the work of a mere rhetorician.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The Meccan Súras.]\r\n\r\n  \"Muḥammad's single aim in the Meccan Súras,\" says Nöldeke, \"is to\r\n  convert the people, by means of persuasion, from their false gods to\r\n  the One God. To whatever point the discourse is directed, this\r\n  always remains the ground-thought; but instead of seeking to\r\n  convince the reason of his hearers by logical proofs, he employs the\r\n  arts of rhetoric to work upon their minds through the imagination.\r\n  Thus he glorifies God, describes His working in Nature and History,\r\n  and ridicules on the other hand the impotence of the idols.\r\n  Especially important are the descriptions of the everlasting bliss\r\n  of the pious and the torments of the wicked: these, particularly the\r\n  latter, must be regarded as one of the mightiest factors in the\r\n  propagation of Islam, through the impression which they make on the\r\n  imagination of simple men who have not been hardened, from their\r\n  youth up, by similar theological ideas. The Prophet often attacks\r\n  his heathen adversaries personally and threatens them with eternal\r\n  punishment; but while he is living among heathens alone, he seldom\r\n  assails the Jews who stand much nearer to him, and the Christians\r\n  scarcely ever.\"[314]\r\n\r\nThe preposterous arrangement of the Koran, to which I have already\r\nadverted, is mainly responsible for the opinion almost unanimously held\r\nby European readers that it is obscure, tiresome, uninteresting; a\r\nfarrago of long-winded narratives and prosaic exhortations, quite\r\nunworthy to be named in the same breath with the Prophetical Books of\r\nthe Old Testament. One may, indeed, peruse the greater part of the\r\nvolume, beginning with the first chapter, and find but a few passages of\r\ngenuine enthusiasm to relieve the prevailing dulness. It is in the short\r\nSúras placed at the end of the Koran that we must look for evidence of\r\nMuḥammad's prophetic gift. These are the earliest of all; in these the\r\nflame of inspiration burns purely and its natural force is not abated.\r\nThe following versions, like those which have preceded, imitate the\r\noriginal form as closely, I think, as is possible in English. They\r\ncannot, of course, do more than faintly suggest the striking effect of\r\nthe sonorous Arabic when read aloud. The Koran was designed for oral\r\nrecitation, and it must be _heard_ in order to be justly appraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF THE SEVERING (LXXXII).\r\n\r\n  (1) When the Sky shall be severèd,\r\n  (2) And when the Stars shall be shiverèd,\r\n  (3) And when the Seas to mingle shall be sufferèd,\r\n  (4) And when the Graves shall be uncoverèd--\r\n  (5) A soul shall know that which it hath deferred or deliverèd.[315]\r\n  (6) O Man, what beguiled thee against thy gracious Master to rebel,\r\n  (7) Who created thee and fashioned thee right and thy frame did fairly\r\n        build?\r\n  (8) He composed thee in whatever form He willed.\r\n  (9) Nay, but ye disbelieve in the Ordeal![316]\r\n (10) Verily over you are Recorders honourable,\r\n (11) Your deeds inscribing without fail:[317]\r\n (12) What ye do they know well.\r\n (13) Surely the pious in delight shall dwell,\r\n (14) And surely the wicked shall be in Hell,\r\n (15) Burning there on the Day of Ordeal;\r\n (16) And evermore Hell-fire they shall feel!\r\n (17) What shall make thee to understand what is the Day of Ordeal?\r\n (18) Again, what shall make thee to understand what is the Day\r\n        of Ordeal?--\r\n (19) A Day when one soul shall not obtain anything for another soul,\r\n        but the command on that Day shall be with God alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF THE SIGNS (LXXXV).\r\n\r\n  (1) By the Heaven in which Signs are set,\r\n  (2) By the Day that is promisèd,\r\n  (3) By the Witness and the Witnessèd:--\r\n  (4) Cursèd be the Fellows of the Pit, they that spread\r\n  (5) The fire with fuel fed,\r\n  (6) When they sate by its head\r\n  (7) And saw how their contrivance against the Believers sped;[318]\r\n  (8) And they punished them not save that they believed on God,\r\n         the Almighty, the Glorified,\r\n  (9) To whom is the Kingdom of Heaven and Earth, and He\r\n         seeth every thing beside.\r\n (10) Verily, for those who afflict believing men and women and\r\n         repent not, the torment of Gehenna and the torment of\r\n         burning is prepared.\r\n (11) Verily, for those who believe and work righteousness are\r\n         Gardens beneath which rivers flow: this is the great\r\n         Reward.\r\n (12) Stern is the vengeance of thy Lord.\r\n (13) He createth the living and reviveth the dead:\r\n (14) He doth pardon and kindly entreat:\r\n (15) The majestic Throne is His seat:\r\n (16) That he willeth He doeth indeed.\r\n (17) Hath not word come to thee of the multitude\r\n (18) Of Pharaoh, and of Thamúd?[319]\r\n (19) Nay, the infidels cease not from falsehood,\r\n (20) But God encompasseth them about.\r\n (21) Surely, it is a Sublime Koran that ye read,\r\n (22) On a Table inviolate.[320]\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF THE SMITING (CI).\r\n\r\n  (1) The Smiting!

There is no god but God.\r\n\r\n2. Muḥammad is the Apostle of God, and the Koran is the Word of God\r\nrevealed to His Apostle.\r\n\r\n3. The dead shall be raised to life at the Last Judgment, when every one\r\nshall be judged by his actions in the present life.\r\n\r\n4. The pious shall enter Paradise and the wicked shall go down to Hell.\r\n\r\nTaking these doctrines separately, let us consider a little more in\r\ndetail how each of them is stated and by what arguments it is enforced.\r\nThe time had not yet come for drawing the sword: Muḥammad repeats again\r\nand again that he is only a warner (_nadhír_) invested with no authority\r\nto compel where he cannot persuade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Unity of God.]\r\n\r\n1. The Meccans acknowledged the supreme position of Allah, but in\r\nordinary circumstances neglected him in favour of their idols, so that,\r\nas Muḥammad complains, \"_When danger befalls you on the sea, the gods\r\nwhom ye invoke are forgotten except Him alone; yet when He brought you\r\nsafe to land, ye turned your backs on Him, for Man is ungrateful._\"[321]\r\nThey were strongly attached to the cult of the Ka‘ba, not only by\r\nself-interest, but also by the more respectable motives of piety towards\r\ntheir ancestors and pride in their traditions. Muḥammad himself regarded\r\nAllah as Lord of the Ka‘ba, and called upon the Quraysh to worship him\r\nas such (Kor. cvi, 3). When they refused to do so on the ground that\r\nthey were afraid lest the Arabs should rise against them and drive them\r\nforth from the land, he assured them that Allah was the author of all\r\ntheir prosperity (Kor. xxviii, 57). His main argument, however, is drawn\r\nfrom the weakness of the idols, which cannot create even a fly,\r\ncontrasted with the wondrous manifestations of Divine power and\r\nprovidence in the creation of the heavens and the earth and all living\r\nthings.[322]\r\n\r\nIt was probably towards the close of the Meccan period that Muḥammad\r\nsummarised his Unitarian ideas in the following emphatic formula:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF PURIFICATION (CXII).[323]\r\n\r\n  (1) Say: 'God is One;\r\n  (2) God who liveth on;\r\n  (3) Without father and without son;\r\n  (4) And like to Him there is none!'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muḥammad, the Apostle of God.]\r\n\r\n2. We have seen that when Muḥammad first appeared as a prophet he was\r\nthought by all except a very few to be _majnún_, _i.e._, possessed by a\r\n_jinní_, or genie, if I may use a word which will send the reader back\r\nto his _Arabian Nights_. The heathen Arabs regarded such\r\npersons--soothsayers, diviners, and poets--with a certain respect; and\r\nif Muḥammad's 'madness' had taken a normal course, his claim to\r\ninspiration would have passed unchallenged. What moved the Quraysh to\r\noppose him was not disbelief in his inspiration--it mattered little to\r\nthem whether he was under the spell of Allah or one of the _Jinn_--but\r\nthe fact that he preached doctrines which wounded their sentiments,\r\nthreatened their institutions, and subverted the most cherished\r\ntraditions of old Arabian life. But in order successfully to resist the\r\npropaganda for which he alleged a Divine warrant, they were obliged to\r\nmeet him on his own ground and to maintain that he was no prophet at\r\nall, no Apostle of Allah, as he asserted, but \"an insolent liar,\" \"a\r\nschooled madman,\" \"an infatuated poet,\" and so forth; and that his\r\nKoran, which he gave out to be the Word of Allah, was merely \"old folks'\r\ntales\" (_asáṭíru ’l-awwalín_), or the invention of a poet or a sorcerer.\r\n\"Is not he,\" they cried, \"a man like ourselves, who wishes to domineer\r\nover us? Let him show us a miracle, that we may believe.\" Muḥammad could\r\nonly reiterate his former assertions and warn the infidels that a\r\nterrible punishment was in store for them either in this world or the\r\nnext. Time after time he compares himself to the ancient prophets--Noah,\r\nAbraham, Moses, and their successors--who are represented as employing\r\nexactly the same arguments and receiving the same answers as Muḥammad;\r\nand bids his people hearken to him lest they utterly perish like the\r\nungodly before them. The truth of the Koran is proved, he says, by the\r\nPentateuch and the Gospel, all being Revelations of the One God, and\r\ntherefore identical in substance. He is no mercenary soothsayer, he\r\nseeks no personal advantage: his mission is solely to preach. The demand\r\nfor a miracle he could not satisfy except by pointing to his visions of\r\nthe Angel and especially to the Koran itself, every verse of which was a\r\ndistinct sign or miracle (_áyat_).[324] If he has forged it, why are his\r\nadversaries unable to produce anything similar? \"_Say: 'If men and\r\ngenies united to bring the like of this Koran, they could not bring the\r\nlike although they should back each other up'_\" (Kor. xvii, 90).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resurrection and Retribution.]\r\n\r\n3. Such notions of a future life as were current in Pre-islamic Arabia\r\nnever rose beyond vague and barbarous superstition, _e.g._, the fancy\r\nthat the dead man's tomb was haunted by his spirit in the shape of a\r\nscreeching owl.[325] No wonder, then, that the ideas of Resurrection and\r\nRetribution, which are enforced by threats and arguments on almost every\r\npage of the Koran, appeared to the Meccan idolaters absurdly ridiculous\r\nand incredible. \"_Does Ibn Kabsha promise us that we shall live?_\" said\r\none of their poets. \"_How can there be life for the ṣadá and the háma?\r\nDost thou omit to ward me from death, and wilt thou revive me when my\r\nbones are rotten?_\"[326] God provided His Apostle with a ready answer to\r\nthese gibes: \"_Say: 'He shall revive them who produced them at first,\r\nfor He knoweth every creation_\" (Kor. xxxvi, 79). This topic is\r\neloquently illustrated, but Muḥammad's hearers were probably less\r\nimpressed by the creative power of God as exhibited in Nature and in Man\r\nthan by the awful examples, to which reference has been made, of His\r\ndestructive power as manifested in History. To Muḥammad himself, at the\r\noutset of his mission, it seemed an appalling certainty that he must one\r\nday stand before God and render an account; the overmastering sense of\r\nhis own responsibility goaded him to preach in the hope of saving his\r\ncountrymen, and supplied him, weak and timorous as he was, with strength\r\nto endure calumny and persecution. As Nöldeke has remarked, the grandest\r\nSúras of the whole Koran are those in which Muḥammad describes how all\r\nNature trembles and quakes at the approach of the Last Judgment. \"It is\r\nas though one actually saw the earth heaving, the mountains crumbling to\r\ndust, and the stars hurled hither and thither in wild confusion.\"[327]\r\nSúras lxxxii and ci, which have been translated above, are specimens of\r\nthe true prophetic style.[328]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Muḥammadan Paradise.]\r\n\r\n4. There is nothing spiritual in Muḥammad's pictures of Heaven and Hell.\r\nHis Paradise is simply a glorified pleasure-garden, where the pious\r\nrepose in cool shades, quaffing spicy wine and diverting themselves with\r\nthe Houris (_Ḥúr_), lovely dark-eyed damsels like pearls hidden in their\r\nshells.[329] This was admirably calculated to allure his hearers by\r\nreminding them of one of their chief enjoyments--the gay drinking\r\nparties which occasionally broke the monotony of Arabian life, and which\r\nare often described in Pre-islamic poetry; indeed, it is highly probable\r\nthat Muḥammad drew a good deal of his Paradise from this source. The\r\ngross and sensual character of the Muḥammadan Afterworld is commonly\r\nthought to betray a particular weakness of the Prophet or is charged to\r\nthe Arabs in general, but as Professor Bevan has pointed out, \"the real\r\nexplanation seems to be that at first the idea of a future retribution\r\nwas absolutely new both to Muḥammad himself and to the public which he\r\naddressed. Paradise and Hell had no traditional associations, and the\r\nArabic language furnished no religious terminology for the expression of\r\nsuch ideas; if they were to be made comprehensible at all, it could only\r\nbe done by means of precise descriptions, of imagery borrowed from\r\nearthly affairs.\"[330]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prayer.]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad was no mere visionary. Ritual observances, vigils, and other\r\nausterities entered largely into his religion, endowing it with the\r\nformal and ascetic character which it retains to the present day. Prayer\r\nwas introduced soon after the first Revelations: in one of the oldest\r\n(Súra lxxxvii, 14-15) we read, \"_Prosperous is he who purifies himself\r\n(or gives alms) and repeats the name of his Lord and prays._\" Although\r\nthe five daily prayers obligatory upon every true believer are nowhere\r\nmentioned in the Koran, the opening chapter (_Súratu ’l-Fátiḥa_), which\r\nanswers to our Lord's Prayer, is constantly recited on these occasions,\r\nand is seldom omitted from any act of public or private devotion. Since\r\nthe _Fátiḥa_ probably belongs to the latest Meccan period, it may find a\r\nplace here.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE OPENING SÚRA (I).\r\n\r\n  (1) In the name of God, the Merciful, who forgiveth aye!\r\n  (2) Praise to God, the Lord of all that be,\r\n  (3) The Merciful, who forgiveth aye,\r\n  (4) The King of Judgment Day!\r\n  (5) Thee we worship and for Thine aid we pray.\r\n  (6) Lead us in the right way,\r\n  (7) The way of those to whom thou hast been gracious, against\r\n          whom thou hast not waxed wroth, and who go not\r\n          astray!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Night journey and Ascension of Muḥammad.]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, shortly before the Migration, Muḥammad dreamed that\r\nhe was transported from the Ka‘ba to the Temple at Jerusalem, and thence\r\nup to the seventh heaven. The former part of the vision is indicated in\r\nthe Koran (xvii, 1): \"_Glory to him who took His servant a journey by\r\nnight from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, the precinct\r\nwhereof we have blessed, to show him of our signs!_\" Tradition has\r\nwondrously embellished the _Mi‘ráj_, by which name the Ascension of the\r\nProphet is generally known throughout the East; while in Persia and\r\nTurkey it has long been a favourite theme for the mystic and the poet.\r\nAccording to the popular belief, which is also held by the majority of\r\nMoslem divines, Muḥammad was transported in the body to his journey's\r\nend, but he himself never countenanced this literal interpretation,\r\nthough it seems to have been current in Mecca, and we are told that it\r\ncaused some of his incredulous followers to abandon their faith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muḥammad at Medína.]\r\n\r\nPossessed and inspired by the highest idea of which man is capable,\r\nfearlessly preaching the truth revealed to him, leading almost alone\r\nwhat long seemed to be a forlorn hope against the impregnable stronghold\r\nof superstition, yet facing these tremendous odds with a calm resolution\r\nwhich yielded nothing to ridicule or danger, but defied his enemies to\r\ndo their worst--Muḥammad in the early part of his career presents a\r\nspectacle of grandeur which cannot fail to win our sympathy and\r\nadmiration. At Medína, whither we must now return, he appears in a less\r\nfavourable light: the days of pure religious enthusiasm have passed away\r\nfor ever, and the Prophet is overshadowed by the Statesman. The\r\nMigration was undoubtedly essential to the establishment of Islam. It\r\nwas necessary that Muḥammad should cut himself off from his own people\r\nin order that he might found a community in which not blood but religion\r\nformed the sole bond that was recognised. This task he\r\naccomplished with consummate sagacity and skill, though some of the\r\nmethods which he employed can only be excused by his conviction that\r\nwhatever he did was done in the name of Allah. As the supreme head of\r\nthe Moslem theocracy both in spiritual and temporal matters--for Islam\r\nallows no distinction between Church and State--he exercised absolute\r\nauthority, and he did not hesitate to justify by Divine mandate acts of\r\nwhich the heathen Arabs, cruel and treacherous as they were, might have\r\nbeen ashamed to be guilty. We need not inquire how much was due to\r\nbelief in his inspiration and how much to deliberate policy. If it\r\nrevolts us to see God Almighty introduced in the rôle of special\r\npleader, we ought to remember that Muḥammad, being what he was, could\r\nscarcely have considered the question from that point of view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medína predisposed to welcome Muḥammad as Legislator and\r\nProphet.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions prevailing at Medína were singularly adapted to his\r\ndesign. Ever since the famous battle of Bu‘áth (about 615 A.D.), in\r\nwhich the Banú Aws, with the help of their Jewish allies, the Banú\r\nQurayẓa and the Banú Naḍír, inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Banú\r\nKhazraj, the city had been divided into two hostile camps; and if peace\r\nhad hitherto been preserved, it was only because both factions were too\r\nexhausted to renew the struggle. Wearied and distracted by earthly\r\ncalamities, men's minds willingly admit the consolations of religion. We\r\nfind examples of this tendency at Medína even before the Migration. Abú\r\n‘Ámir, whose ascetic life gained for him the title of 'The Monk'\r\n(_al-Ráhib_), is numbered among the _Ḥanífs_.[331] He fought in the\r\nranks of the Quraysh at Uḥud, and finally went to Syria, where he died\r\nan outlaw. Another Pre-islamic monotheist of Medína, Abú Qays b. Abí\r\nAnas, is said to have turned Moslem in his old age.[332]\r\n\r\n  \"The inhabitants of Medína had no material interest in idol-worship\r\n  and no sanctuary to guard. Through uninterrupted contact with the\r\n  Jews of the city and neighbourhood, as also with the Christian\r\n  tribes settled in the extreme north of Arabia on the confines of the\r\n  Byzantine Empire, they had learned, as it were instinctively, to\r\n  despise their inherited belief in idols and to respect the far\r\n  nobler and purer faith in a single God; and lastly, they had become\r\n  accustomed to the idea of a Divine revelation by means of a special\r\n  scripture of supernatural origin, like the Pentateuch and the\r\n  Gospel. From a religious standpoint paganism in Medína offered no\r\n  resistance to Islam: as a faith, it was dead before it was attacked;\r\n  none defended it, none mourned its disappearance. The pagan\r\n  opposition to Muḥammad's work as a reformer was entirely\r\n  political, and proceeded from those who wished to preserve the\r\n  anarchy of the old heathen life, and who disliked the dictatorial\r\n  rule of Muḥammad.\"[333]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parties in Medína.]\r\n\r\nThere were in Medína four principal parties, consisting of those who\r\neither warmly supported or actively opposed the Prophet, or who adopted\r\na relatively neutral attitude, viz., the Emigrants (_Muhájirún_), the\r\nHelpers (_Anṣár_), the Hypocrites (_Munáfiqún_), and the Jews (_Yahúd_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Emigrants.]\r\n\r\nThe Emigrants were those Moslems who left their homes at Mecca and\r\naccompanied the Prophet in his Migration (_Hijra_)--whence their name,\r\n_Muhájirún_--to Medína in the year 622. Inasmuch as they had lost\r\neverything except the hope of victory and vengeance, he could count upon\r\ntheir fanatical devotion to himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Helpers.]\r\n\r\nThe Helpers were those inhabitants of Medína who had accepted Islam and\r\npledged themselves to protect Muḥammad in case of attack. Together with\r\nthe Emigrants they constituted a formidable and ever-increasing body of\r\ntrue believers, the first champions of the Church militant.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The Hypocrites.]\r\n\r\n  \"Many citizens of Medína, however, were not so well disposed towards\r\n  Muḥammad, and neither acknowledged him as a Prophet nor would\r\n  submit to him as their Ruler; but since they durst not come forward\r\n  against him openly on account of the multitude of his enthusiastic\r\n  adherents, they met him with a passive resistance which more than\r\n  once thwarted his plans, their influence was so great that he, on\r\n  his part, did not venture to take decisive measures against them,\r\n  and sometimes even found it necessary to give way.\"[334]\r\n\r\nThese are the Hypocrites whom Muḥammad describes in the following\r\nverses of the Koran:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SÚRA OF THE HEIFER (II).\r\n\r\n  (7) And there are those among men who say, 'We believe in God\r\n        and in the Last Day'; but they do not believe.\r\n\r\n  (8) They would deceive God and those who do believe; but they\r\n        deceive only themselves and they do not perceive.\r\n\r\n  (9) In their hearts is a sickness, and God has made them still more\r\n        sick, and for them is grievous woe because they lied.[335]\r\n\r\nTheir leader, ‘Abdulláh b. Ubayy, an able man but of weak character, was\r\nno match for Muḥammad, whom he and his partisans only irritated, without\r\never becoming really dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Jews.]\r\n\r\nThe Jews, on the other hand, gave the Prophet serious trouble. At first\r\nhe cherished high hopes that they would accept the new Revelation which\r\nhe brought to them, and which he maintained to be the original Word of\r\nGod as it was formerly revealed to Abraham and Moses; but when the Jews,\r\nperceiving the absurdity of this idea, plied him with all sorts of\r\nquestions and made merry over his ignorance, Muḥammad, keenly alive to\r\nthe damaging effect of the criticism to which he had exposed himself,\r\nturned upon his tormentors, and roundly accused them of having falsified\r\nand corrupted their Holy Books. Henceforth he pursued them with a deadly\r\nhatred against which their political disunion rendered them helpless. A\r\nfew sought refuge in Islam; the rest were either slaughtered or driven\r\ninto exile.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to detail here the successive steps by which Muḥammad\r\nin the course of a few years overcame all opposition and established the\r\nsupremacy of Islam from one end of Arabia to the other. I shall notice\r\nthe outstanding events very briefly in order to make room for matters\r\nwhich are more nearly connected with the subject of this History.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginnings of the Moslem State.]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad's first care was to reconcile the desperate factions within the\r\ncity and to introduce law and order among the heterogeneous elements\r\nwhich have been described. \"He drew up in writing a charter between the\r\nEmigrants and the Helpers, in which charter he embodied a covenant with\r\nthe Jews, confirming them in the exercise of their religion and in the\r\npossession of their properties, imposing upon them certain obligations,\r\nand granting to them certain rights.\"[336] This remarkable document is\r\nextant in Ibn Hishám's _Biography of Muḥammad_, pp. 341-344. Its\r\ncontents have been analysed in masterly fashion by Wellhausen,[337] who\r\nobserves with justice that it was no solemn covenant, accepted and duly\r\nratified by representatives of the parties concerned, but merely a\r\ndecree of Muḥammad based upon conditions already existing which had\r\ndeveloped since his arrival in Medína. At the same time no one can study\r\nit without being impressed by the political genius of its author.\r\nOstensibly a cautious and tactful reform, it was in reality a\r\nrevolution. Muḥammad durst not strike openly at the independence of the\r\ntribes, but he destroyed it, in effect, by shifting the centre of power\r\nfrom the tribe to the community; and although the community included\r\nJews and pagans as well as Moslems, he fully recognised, what his\r\nopponents failed to foresee, that the Moslems were the active, and must\r\nsoon be the predominant, partners in the newly founded State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Badr, January, 624 A.D.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Uḥud, 625 A.D.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Submission of Mecca, 630 A.D.]\r\n\r\nAll was now ripe for the inevitable struggle with the Quraysh, and God\r\nrevealed to His Apostle several verses of the Koran in which the\r\nFaithful are commanded to wage a Holy War against them: \"_Permission is\r\ngiven to those who fight because they have been wronged,--and verily God\r\nto help them has the might,--who have been driven forth from their homes\r\nundeservedly, only for that they said, 'Our Lord is God'_\" (xxii,\r\n40-41). \"_Kill them wherever ye find them, and drive them out from\r\nwhence they drive you out_\" (ii, 187). \"_Fight them that there be no\r\nsedition and that the religion may be God's_\" (ii, 189). In January, 624\r\nA.D., the Moslems, some three hundred strong, won a glorious victory at\r\nBadr over a greatly superior force which had marched out from Mecca to\r\nrelieve a rich caravan that Muḥammad threatened to cut off. The Quraysh\r\nfought bravely, but were borne down by the irresistible onset of men who\r\nhad learned discipline in the mosque and looked upon death as a sure\r\npassport to Paradise. Of the Moslems only fourteen fell; the Quraysh\r\nlost forty-nine killed and about the same number of prisoners. But the\r\nimportance of Muḥammad's success cannot be measured by the material\r\ndamage which he inflicted. Considering the momentous issues involved, we\r\nmust allow that Badr, like Marathon, is one of the greatest and most\r\nmemorable battles in all history. Here, at last, was the miracle which\r\nthe Prophet's enemies demanded of him: \"_Ye have had a sign in the two\r\nparties who met; one party fighting in the way of God, the other\r\nmisbelieving; these saw twice the same number as themselves to the\r\neyesight, for God aids with His help those whom He pleases. Verily in\r\nthat is a lesson for those who have perception_\" (Kor. iii, 11). And\r\nagain, \"_Ye slew them not, but God slew them_\" (Kor. viii, 17). The\r\nvictory of Badr turned all eyes upon Muḥammad. However little the Arabs\r\ncared for his religion, they could not but respect the man who had\r\nhumbled the lords of Mecca. He was now a power in the land--\"Muḥammad,\r\nKing of the Ḥijáz.\"[338] In Medína his cause flourished mightily. The\r\nzealots were confirmed in their faith, the waverers convinced, the\r\ndisaffected overawed. He sustained a serious, though temporary, check in\r\nthe following year at Uḥud, where a Moslem army was routed by the\r\nQuraysh under Abú Sufyán, but the victors were satisfied with having\r\ntaken vengeance for Badr and made no attempt to follow up their\r\nadvantage; while Muḥammad, never resting on his laurels, never losing\r\nsight of the goal, proceeded with remorseless calculation to crush his\r\nadversaries one after the other, until in January, 630 A.D., the Meccans\r\nthemselves, seeing the futility of further resistance, opened their\r\ngates to the Prophet and acknowledged the omnipotence of Allah. The\r\nsubmission of the Holy City left Muḥammad without a rival in Arabia. His\r\nwork was almost done. Deputations from the Bedouin tribes poured into\r\nMedína, offering allegiance to the conqueror of the Quraysh, and\r\nreluctantly subscribing to a religion in which they saw nothing so\r\nagreeable as the prospect of plundering its enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Muḥammad, 632 A.D.]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad died, after a brief illness, on the 8th of June, 632 A.D. He\r\nwas succeeded as head of the Moslem community by his old friend and\r\never-loyal supporter, Abú Bakr, who thus became the first _Khalífa_, or\r\nCaliph. It only remains to take up our survey of the Koran, which we\r\nhave carried down to the close of the Meccan period, and to indicate the\r\ncharacter and contents of the Revelation during the subsequent decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Medína Súras.]\r\n\r\nThe Medína Súras faithfully reflect the marvellous change in Muḥammad's\r\nfortunes, which began with his flight from Mecca. He was now recognised\r\nas the Prophet and Apostle of God, but this recognition made him an\r\nearthly potentate and turned his religious activity into secular\r\nchannels. One who united in himself the parts of prince, legislator,\r\npolitician, diplomatist, and general may be excused if he sometimes\r\nneglected the Divine injunction to arise and preach, or at any rate\r\ninterpreted it in a sense very different from that which he formerly\r\nattached to it. The Revelations of this time deal, to a large extent,\r\nwith matters of legal, social, and political interest; they promulgate\r\nreligious ordinances--_e.g._, fasting, alms-giving, and\r\npilgrimage--expound the laws of marriage and divorce, and comment upon\r\nthe news of the day; often they serve as bulletins or manifestoes in\r\nwhich Muḥammad justifies what he has done, urges the Moslems to fight\r\nand rebukes the laggards, moralises on a victory or defeat, proclaims a\r\ntruce, and says, in short, whatever the occasion seems to require.\r\nInstead of the Meccan idolaters, his opponents in Medína--the Jews and\r\nHypocrites--have become the great rocks of offence; the Jews especially\r\nare denounced in long passages as a stiff-necked generation who never\r\nhearkened to their own prophets of old. However valuable historically,\r\nthe Medína Súras do not attract the literary reader. In their flat and\r\ntedious style they resemble those of the later Meccan period. Now and\r\nagain the ashes burst into flame, though such moments of splendour are\r\nincreasingly rare, as in the famous 'Throne-verse' (_Áyatu ’l-Kursí_):--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The 'Throne-verse.']\r\n\r\n  \"God, there is no god but He, the living, the self-subsistent.\r\n  Slumber takes Him not, nor sleep. His is what is in the heavens and\r\n  what is in the earth. Who is it that intercedes with Him save by His\r\n  permission? He knows what is before them and what behind them, and\r\n  they comprehend not aught of His knowledge but of what He pleases.\r\n  His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and it tires Him\r\n  not to guard them both, for He is high and grand.\"[339]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nationalisation of Islam.]\r\n\r\nThe Islam which Muḥammad brought with him to Medína was almost entirely\r\nderived by oral tradition from Christianity and Judaism, and just for\r\nthis reason it made little impression on the heathen Arabs, whose\r\nreligious ideas were generally of the most primitive kind.\r\nNotwithstanding its foreign character and the absence of anything which\r\nappealed to Arabian national sentiment, it spread rapidly in Medína,\r\nwhere, as we have seen, the soil was already prepared for it; but one\r\nmay well doubt whether it could have extended its sway over the\r\npeninsula unless the course of events had determined Muḥammad to\r\nassociate the strange doctrines of Islam with the ancient heathen\r\nsanctuary at Mecca, the Ka‘ba, which was held in universal veneration by\r\nthe Arabs and formed the centre of a worship that raised no difficulties\r\nin their minds. Before he had lived many months in Medína the Prophet\r\nrealised that his hope of converting the Jews was doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Accordingly he instructed his followers that they should\r\nno longer turn their faces in prayer towards the Temple at Jerusalem, as\r\nthey had been accustomed to do since the Flight, but towards the Ka‘ba;\r\nwhile, a year or two later, he incorporated in Islam the superstitious\r\nceremonies of the pilgrimage, which were represented as having been\r\noriginally prescribed to Abraham, the legendary founder of the Ka‘ba,\r\nwhose religion he professed to restore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antagonism of Islamic and Arabian ideals.]\r\n\r\nThese concessions, however, were far from sufficient to reconcile the\r\nfree-living and freethinking people of the desert to a religion which\r\nrestrained their pleasures, forced them to pay taxes and perform\r\nprayers, and stamped with the name of barbarism all the virtues they\r\nheld most dear. The teaching of Islam ran directly counter to the ideals\r\nand traditions of heathendom, and, as Goldziher has remarked, its\r\noriginality lies not in its doctrines, which are Jewish and Christian,\r\nbut in the fact that it was Muḥammad who first maintained these\r\ndoctrines with persistent energy against the Arabian view of life.[340]\r\nWhile we must refer the reader to Dr. Goldziher's illuminating pages for\r\na full discussion of the conflict between the new Religion (_Dín_) and\r\nthe old Virtue (_Muruwwa_), it will not be amiss to summarise the chief\r\npoints at which they clashed with each other.[341] In the first place,\r\nthe fundamental idea of Islam was foreign and unintelligible to the\r\nBedouins. \"It was not the destruction of their idols that they opposed\r\nso much as the spirit of devotion which it was sought to implant in\r\nthem: the determination of their whole lives by the thought of God and\r\nof His pre-ordaining and retributive omnipotence, the prayers and fasts,\r\nthe renouncement of coveted pleasures, and the sacrifice of money and\r\nproperty which was demanded of them in God's name.\" In spite of the\r\nsaying, _Lá dína illá bi ’l-muruwwati_ (\"There is no religion without\r\nvirtue\"), the Bedouin who accepted Islam had to unlearn the greater part\r\nof his unwritten moral code. As a pious Moslem he must return good for\r\nevil, forgive his enemy, and find balm for his wounded feelings in the\r\nassurance of being admitted to Paradise (Kor. iii, 128). Again, the\r\nsocial organisation of the heathen Arabs was based on the tribe, whereas\r\nthat of Islam rested on the equality and fraternity of all believers.\r\nThe religious bond cancelled all distinctions of rank and pedigree; it\r\ndid away, theoretically, with clannish feuds, contests for honour, pride\r\nof race--things that lay at the very root of Arabian chivalry. \"_Lo_,\"\r\ncried Muḥammad, \"_the noblest of you in the sight of God is he who most\r\ndoth fear Him_\" (Kor. xlix, 13). Against such doctrine the conservative\r\nand material instincts of the desert people rose in revolt; and although\r\nthey became Moslems _en masse_, the majority of them neither believed in\r\nIslam nor knew what it meant. Often their motives were frankly\r\nutilitarian: they expected that Islam would bring them luck; and so long\r\nas they were sound in body, and their mares had fine foals, and their\r\nwives bore well-formed sons, and their wealth and herds multiplied, they\r\nsaid, \"We have been blessed ever since we adopted this religion,\" and\r\nwere content; but if things went ill they blamed Islam and turned their\r\nbacks on it.[342] That these men were capable of religious zeal is amply\r\nproved by the triumphs which they won a short time afterwards over the\r\ndisciplined armies of two mighty empires; but what chiefly inspired\r\nthem, apart from love of booty, was the conviction, born of success,\r\nthat Allah was fighting on their side.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have sketched, however barely and imperfectly, the progress of Islam\r\nfrom Muḥammad's first appearance as a preacher to the day of his death.\r\nIn these twenty years the seeds were sown of almost every development\r\nwhich occurs in the political and intellectual history of the Arabs\r\nduring the ages to come. More than any man that has ever lived, Muḥammad\r\nshaped the destinies of his people; and though they left him far behind\r\nas they moved along the path of civilisation, they still looked back to\r\nhim for guidance and authority at each step. This is not the place to\r\nattempt an estimate of his character, which has been so diversely\r\njudged. Personally, I feel convinced that he was neither a shameless\r\nimpostor nor a neurotic degenerate nor a socialistic reformer, but in\r\nthe beginning, at all events, a sincere religious enthusiast, as truly\r\ninspired as any prophet of the Old Testament.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Character of Muḥammad.]\r\n\r\n  \"We find in him,\" writes De Goeje, \"that sober understanding which\r\n  distinguished his fellow-tribesmen: dignity, tact, and equilibrium;\r\n  qualities which are seldom found in people of morbid constitution:\r\n  self-control in no small degree. Circumstances changed him from a\r\n  Prophet to a Legislator and a Ruler, but for himself he sought\r\n  nothing beyond the acknowledgment that he was Allah's Apostle, since\r\n  this acknowledgment includes the whole of Islam. He was excitable,\r\n  like every true Arab, and in the spiritual struggle which preceded\r\n  his call this quality was stimulated to an extent that alarmed even\r\n  himself; but that does not make him a visionary. He defends himself,\r\n  by the most solemn asseveration, against the charge that what he had\r\n  seen was an illusion of the senses. Why should not we believe\r\n  him?\"[343]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ORTHODOX CALIPHATE AND THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caliphate--_i.e._, the period of the Caliphs or Successors of\r\nMuḥammad--extends over six centuries and a quarter (632-1258 A.D.),\r\nand falls into three clearly-marked divisions of very unequal length and\r\ndiverse character.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Orthodox Caliphate (632-661 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe first division begins with the election of Abú Bakr, the first\r\nCaliph, in 632, and comes to an end with the assassination of ‘Alí, the\r\nProphet's son-in-law and fourth successor, in 661. These four Caliphs\r\nare known as the Orthodox (_al-Ráshidún_), because they trod faithfully\r\nin the footsteps of the Prophet and ruled after his example in the holy\r\ncity of Medína, with the assistance of his leading Companions, who\r\nconstituted an informal Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ummayyad Caliphate (661-750 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe second division includes the Caliphs of the family of Umayya, from\r\nthe accession of Mu‘áwiya in 661 to the great battle of the Záb in 750,\r\nwhen Marwán II, the last of his line, was defeated by the ‘Abbásids, who\r\nclaimed the Caliphate as next of kin to the Prophet. According to Moslem\r\nnotions the Umayyads were kings by right, Caliphs only by courtesy. They\r\nhad, as we shall see, no spiritual title, and little enough religion of\r\nany sort. This dynasty, which had been raised and was upheld by the\r\nSyrian Arabs, transferred the seat of government from Medína to\r\nDamascus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Abbásid Caliphate (750-1258 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe third division is by far the longest and most important. Starting in\r\n750 with the accession of Abu ’l-‘Abbás al-Saffáh, it presents an\r\nunbroken series of thirty-seven Caliphs of the same House, and\r\nculminates, after the lapse of half a millennium, in the sack of\r\nBaghdád, their magnificent capital, by the Mongol Húlágú (January,\r\n1258). The ‘Abbásids were no less despotic than the Umayyads, but in a\r\nmore enlightened fashion; for, while the latter had been purely Arab in\r\nfeeling, the ‘Abbásids owed their throne to the Persian nationalists,\r\nand were imbued with Persian ideas, which introduced a new and fruitful\r\nelement into Moslem civilisation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Islamic literature.]\r\n\r\nFrom our special point of view the Orthodox and Umayyad Caliphates,\r\nwhich form the subject of the present chapter, are somewhat barren. The\r\nsimple life of the pagan Arabs found full expression in their poetry.\r\nThe many-sided life of the Moslems under ‘Abbásid rule may be studied in\r\na copious literature which exhibits all the characteristics of the age;\r\nbut of contemporary documents illustrating the intellectual history of\r\nthe early Islamic period comparatively little has been preserved, and\r\nthat little, being for the most part anti-Islamic in tendency, gives\r\nonly meagre information concerning what excites interest beyond anything\r\nelse--the religious movement, the rise of theology, and the origin of\r\nthose great parties and sects which emerge, at various stages of\r\ndevelopment, in later literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unity of Church and State.]\r\n\r\nSince the Moslem Church and State are essentially one, it is impossible\r\nto treat of politics apart from religion, nor can religious phenomena be\r\nunderstood without continual reference to political events. The\r\nfollowing brief sketch of the Orthodox Caliphate will show how\r\ncompletely this unity was realised, and what far-reaching consequences\r\nit had.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú Bakr elected Caliph (June, 632 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Musaylima the Liar.]\r\n\r\nThat Muḥammad left no son was perhaps of less moment than his neglect\r\nor refusal to nominate a successor. The Arabs were unfamiliar with the\r\nhereditary descent of kingly power, while the idea had not yet dawned of\r\na Divine right resident in the Prophet's family. It was thoroughly in\r\naccord with Arabian practice that the Moslem community should elect its\r\nown leader, just as in heathen days the tribe chose its own chief. The\r\nlikeliest men--all three belonged to Quraysh--were Abú Bakr, whose\r\ndaughter ‘Á’isha had been Muḥammad's favourite wife, ‘Umar b.\r\nal-Khaṭṭáb, and ‘Alí, Abú Ṭálib's son and Fáṭima's husband,\r\nwho was thus connected with the Prophet by blood as well as by marriage.\r\nAbú Bakr was the eldest, he was supported by ‘Umar, and on him the\r\nchoice ultimately fell, though not without an ominous ebullition of\r\nparty strife. A man of simple tastes and unassuming demeanour, he had\r\nearned the name _al-Ṣiddíq, _i.e._, the True, by his unquestioning\r\nfaith in the Prophet; naturally gentle and merciful, he stood firm when\r\nthe cause of Islam was at stake, and crushed with iron hand the revolt\r\nwhich on the news of Muḥammad's death spread like wildfire through\r\nArabia. False prophets arose, and the Bedouins rallied round them, eager\r\nto throw off the burden of tithes and prayers. In the centre of the\r\npeninsula, the Banú Ḥanífa were led to battle by Musaylima, who\r\nimitated the early style of the Koran with ludicrous effect, if we may\r\njudge from the sayings ascribed to him, _e.g._, \"The elephant, what is\r\nthe elephant, and who shall tell you what is the elephant? He has a poor\r\ntail, and a long trunk: and is a trifling part of the creations of thy\r\nGod.\" Moslem tradition calls him the Liar (_al-Kadhdháb_), and\r\nrepresents him as an obscene miracle-monger, which can hardly be the\r\nwhole truth. It is possible that he got some of his doctrines from\r\nChristianity, as Professor Margoliouth has suggested,[344] but we know\r\ntoo little about them to arrive at any conclusion. After a desperate\r\nstruggle Musaylima was defeated and slain by 'the Sword of Allah,'\r\nKhálid b. Walíd. The Moslem arms were everywhere victorious. Arabia\r\nbowed in sullen submission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Islam a world-religion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of Persia and Syria (633-643 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moslem toleration.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Muir and other biographers of Muḥammad have argued that\r\nIslam was originally designed for the Arabs alone, and made no claim to\r\nuniversal acceptance, their assertion is contradicted by the unequivocal\r\ntestimony of the Koran itself. In one of the oldest Revelations (lxviii,\r\n51-52), we read: \"_It wanteth little but that the unbelievers dash thee\r\nto the ground with their looks_ (of anger) _when they hear the Warning_\r\n(_i.e._, the Koran); _and they say, 'He is assuredly mad': but it_ (the\r\nKoran) _is no other than a_ WARNING UNTO ALL CREATURES\" (_dhikrun li\r\n’l-‘álamín_).[345] The time had now come when this splendid dream was to\r\nbe, in large measure, fulfilled. The great wars of conquest were\r\ninspired by the Prophet's missionary zeal and justified by his example.\r\nPious duty coincided with reasons of state. \"It was certainly good\r\npolicy to turn the recently subdued tribes of the wilderness towards an\r\nexternal aim in which they might at once satisfy their lust for booty on\r\na grand scale, maintain their warlike feeling, and strengthen themselves\r\nin their attachment to the new faith.\"[346] The story of their\r\nachievements cannot be set down here. Suffice it to say that within\r\ntwelve years after the Prophet's death the Persian Empire had been\r\nreduced to a tributary province, and Syria, together with Egypt, torn\r\naway from Byzantine rule. It must not be supposed that the followers of\r\nZoroaster and Christ in these countries were forcibly converted to\r\nIslam. Thousands embraced it of free will, impelled by various motives\r\nwhich we have no space to enumerate; those who clung to the religion in\r\nwhich they had been brought up secured protection and toleration by\r\npayment of a capitation-tax (_jizya_).[347]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Caliph ‘Umar (634-644 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe tide of foreign conquest, which had scarce begun to flow before the\r\ndeath of Abú Bakr, swept with amazing rapidity over Syria and Persia in\r\nthe Caliphate of ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭáb (634-644), and continued to\r\nadvance, though with diminished fury, under the Prophet's third\r\nsuccessor, ‘Uthmán. We may dwell for a little on the noble figure of\r\n‘Umar, who was regarded by good Moslems in after times as an embodiment\r\nof all the virtues which a Caliph ought to possess. Probably his\r\ncharacter has been idealised, but in any case the anecdotes related of\r\nhim give an admirable picture of the man and his age. Here are a few,\r\ntaken almost at random from the pages of Ṭabarí.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: His simple manners.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: His sense of personal responsibility.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The Caliph as a policeman.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: His strictness towards his own family.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Instructions to his governors.]\r\n\r\n  One said: \"I saw ‘Umar coming to the Festival. He walked with bare\r\n  feet, using both hands (for he was ambidextrous) to draw round him a\r\n  red embroidered cloth. He towered above the people, as though he\r\n  were on horseback.\"[348] A client of (the Caliph) ‘Uthmán b. ‘Affán\r\n  relates that he mounted behind his patron and they rode together to\r\n  the enclosure for the beasts which were delivered in payment of the\r\n  poor-tax. It was an exceedingly hot day and the simoom was blowing\r\n  fiercely. They saw a man clad only in a loin-cloth and a short cloak\r\n  (_ridá_), in which he had wrapped his head, driving the camels into\r\n  the enclosure. ‘Uthmán said to his companion, \"Who is this, think\r\n  you?\" When they came up to him, behold, it was ‘Umar b.\r\n  al-Khaṭṭáb. \"By God,\" said ‘Uthmán, \"this is _the strong, the\r\n  trusty_.\"[349]--‘Umar used to go round the markets and recite the\r\n  Koran and judge between disputants wherever he found them.--When\r\n  Ka‘bu ’l-Aḥbár, a well-known Rabbin of Medína, asked how he could\r\n  obtain access to the Commander of the Faithful,[350] he received\r\n  this answer: \"There is no door nor curtain to be passed; he performs\r\n  the rites of prayer, then he takes his seat, and any one that wishes\r\n  may speak to him.\"[351] ‘Umar said in one of his public orations,\r\n  \"By Him who sent Muḥammad with the truth, were a single camel to\r\n  die of neglect on the bank of the Euphrates, I should fear lest God\r\n  should call the family of al-Khaṭṭáb\" (meaning himself) \"to\r\n  account therefor.\"[352]--\"If I live,\" he is reported to have said on\r\n  another occasion, \"please God, I will assuredly spend a whole year\r\n  in travelling among my subjects, for I know they have wants which\r\n  are cut short ere they reach my ears: the governors do not bring the\r\n  wants of the people before me, while the people themselves do not\r\n  attain to me. So I will journey to Syria and remain there two\r\n  months, then to Mesopotamia and remain there two months, then to\r\n  Egypt and remain there two months, then to Baḥrayn and remain\r\n  there two months, then to Kúfa and remain there two months, then to\r\n  Baṣra and remain there two months; and by God, it will be a year\r\n  well spent!\"[353]--One night he came to the house of ‘Abdu\r\n  ’l-Raḥmán b. ‘Awf and knocked at the door, which was opened by\r\n  ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán's wife. \"Do not enter,\" said she, \"until I go\r\n  back and sit in my place;\" so he waited. Then she bade him come in,\r\n  and on his asking, \"Have you anything in the house?\" she fetched him\r\n  some food. Meanwhile ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán was standing by, engaged in\r\n  prayer. \"Be quick, man!\" cried ‘Umar. ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán immediately\r\n  pronounced the final salaam, and turning to the Caliph said: \"O\r\n  Commander of the Faithful, what has brought you here at this hour?\"\r\n  ‘Umar replied: \"A party of travellers who alighted in the\r\n  neighbourhood of the market: I was afraid that the thieves of Medína\r\n  might fall upon them. Let us go and keep watch.\" So he set off with\r\n  ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán, and when they reached the market-place they\r\n  seated themselves on some high ground and began to converse.\r\n  Presently they descried, far away, the light of a lamp. \"Have not I\r\n  forbidden lamps after bedtime?\"[354] exclaimed the Caliph. They went\r\n  to the spot and found a company drinking wine. \"Begone,\" said ‘Umar\r\n  to ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán; \"I know him.\" Next morning he sent for the\r\n  culprit and said, addressing him by name, \"Last night you were\r\n  drinking wine with your friends.\" \"O Commander of the Faithful, how\r\n  did you ascertain that?\" \"I saw it with my own eyes.\" \"Has not God\r\n  forbidden you to play the spy?\" ‘Umar made no answer and pardoned\r\n  his offence.[355]--When ‘Umar ascended the pulpit for the purpose of\r\n  warning the people that they must not do something, he gathered his\r\n  family and said to them: \"I have forbidden the people to do\r\n  so-and-so. Now, the people look at you as birds look at flesh, and I\r\n  swear by God that if I find any one of you doing this thing, I will\r\n  double the penalty against him.\"[356]--Whenever he appointed a\r\n  governor he used to draw up in writing a certificate of investiture,\r\n  which he caused to be witnessed by some of the Emigrants or Helpers.\r\n  It contained the following instructions: That he must not ride on\r\n  horseback, nor eat white bread, nor wear fine clothes, nor set up a\r\n  door between himself and those who had aught to ask of him.[357]--It\r\n  was ‘Umar's custom to go forth with his governors, on their\r\n  appointment, to bid them farewell. \"I have not appointed you,\" he\r\n  would say, \"over the people of Muḥammad (God bless him and grant\r\n  him peace!) that you may drag them by their hair and scourge their\r\n  skins, but in order that you may lead them in prayer and judge\r\n  between them with right and divide (the public money) amongst them\r\n  with equity. I have not made you lords of their skin and hair. Do\r\n  not flog the Arabs lest you humiliate them, and do not keep them\r\n  long on foreign service lest you tempt them to sedition, and do not\r\n  neglect them lest you render them desperate. Confine yourselves to\r\n  the Koran, write few Traditions of Muḥammad (God bless him and\r\n  grant him peace!), and I am your ally.\" He used to permit\r\n  retaliation against his governors. On receiving a complaint about\r\n  any one of them he confronted him with the accuser, and punished him\r\n  if his guilt were proved.[358]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Register of ‘Umar.]\r\n\r\nIt was ‘Umar who first made a Register (_Díwán_) of the Arabs in Islam\r\nand entered them therein according to their tribes and assigned to them\r\ntheir stipends. The following account of its institution is extracted\r\nfrom the charming history entitled _al-Fakhrí_:--\r\n\r\n  In the fifteenth year of the Hijra (636 A.D.) ‘Umar, who was then\r\n  Caliph, seeing that the conquests proceeded without interruption and\r\n  that the treasures of the Persian monarchs had been taken as spoil,\r\n  and that load after load was being accumulated of gold and silver\r\n  and precious jewels and splendid raiment, resolved to enrich the\r\n  Moslems by distributing all this wealth amongst them; but he did not\r\n  know how he should manage it. Now there was a Persian satrap\r\n  (_marzubán_) at Medína who, when he saw ‘Umar's bewilderment, said\r\n  to him, \"O Commander of the Faithful, the Persian kings have a thing\r\n  they call a _Díwán_, in which is kept the whole of their revenues\r\n  and expenditures without exception; and therein those who receive\r\n  stipends are arranged in classes, so that no confusion occurs.\"\r\n  ‘Umar's attention was aroused. He bade the satrap describe it, and\r\n  on comprehending its nature, he drew up the registers and assigned\r\n  the stipends, appointing a specified allowance for every Moslem; and\r\n  he allotted fixed sums to the wives of the Apostle (on whom be God's\r\n  blessing and peace!) and to his concubines and next-of-kin, until he\r\n  exhausted the money in hand. He did not lay up a store in the\r\n  treasury. Some one came to him and said: \"O Commander of the\r\n  Faithful, you should have left something to provide for\r\n  contingencies.\" ‘Umar rebuked him, saying, \"The devil has put these\r\n  words into your mouth. May God preserve me from their mischief! for\r\n  it were a temptation to my successors. Come what may, I will provide\r\n  naught except obedience to God and His Apostle. That is our\r\n  provision, whereby we have gained that which we have gained.\" Then,\r\n  in respect of the stipends, he deemed it right that precedence\r\n  should be according to priority of conversion to Islam and of\r\n  service rendered to the Apostle on his fields of battle.[359]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The aristocracy of Islam.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: \"'Tis only noble to be good.\"]\r\n\r\n  Affinity to Muḥammad was also considered. \"By God,\" exclaimed\r\n  ‘Umar, \"we have not won superiority in this world, nor do we hope\r\n  for recompense for our works from God hereafter, save through\r\n  Muḥammad (God bless him and grant him peace!). He is our title to\r\n  nobility, his tribe are the noblest of the Arabs, and after them\r\n  those are the nobler that are nearer to him in blood. Truly, the\r\n  Arabs are ennobled by God's Apostle. Peradventure some of them have\r\n  many ancestors in common with him, and we ourselves are only removed\r\n  by a few forbears from his line of descent, in which we accompany\r\n  him back to Adam. Notwithstanding this, if the foreigners bring good\r\n  works and we bring none, by God, they are nearer to Muḥammad on\r\n  the day of Resurrection than we. Therefore let no man regard\r\n  affinity, but let him work for that which is in God's hands to\r\n  bestow. He that is retarded by his works will not be sped by his\r\n  lineage.\"[360]\r\n\r\nIt may be said of ‘Umar, not less appropriately than of Cromwell, that\r\nhe\r\n\r\n    \"cast the kingdoms old\r\n  Into another mould;\"\r\n\r\nand he too justified the poet's maxim--\r\n\r\n \"The same arts that did gain\r\n  A power, must it maintain.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foundation of Baṣra and Kúfa (638 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nUnder the system which he organised Arabia, purged of infidels, became a\r\nvast recruiting-ground for the standing armies of Islam: the Arabs in\r\nthe conquered territories formed an exclusive military class, living in\r\ngreat camps and supported by revenues derived from the non-Muḥammadan\r\npopulation. Out of such camps arose two cities destined to make their\r\nmark in literary history--Baṣra (Bassora) on the delta of the Tigris and\r\nEuphrates, and Kúfa, which was founded about the same time on the\r\nwestern branch of the latter stream, not far from Ḥíra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of ‘Umar (644 A.D.)]\r\n\r\n‘Umar was murdered by a Persian slave named Fírúz while leading the\r\nprayers in the Great Mosque. With his death the military theocracy and\r\nthe palmy days of the Patriarchal Caliphate draw to a close. The broad\r\nlines of his character appear in the anecdotes translated above, though\r\nmany details might be added to complete the picture. Simple and frugal;\r\ndoing his duty without fear or favour; energetic even to harshness, yet\r\ncapable of tenderness towards the weak; a severe judge of others and\r\nespecially of himself, he was a born ruler and every inch a man. Looking\r\nback on the turmoils which followed his death one is inclined to agree\r\nwith the opinion of a saintly doctor who said, five centuries\r\nafterwards, that \"the good fortune of Islam was shrouded in the\r\ngrave-clothes of ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭáb.\"[361]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Uthmán elected Caliph (644 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General disaffection.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Uthmán murdered (656 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nWhen the Meccan aristocrats accepted Islam, they only yielded to the\r\ninevitable. They were now to have an opportunity of revenging\r\nthemselves. ‘Uthmán b. ‘Affán, who succeeded ‘Umar as Caliph, belonged\r\nto a distinguished Meccan family, the Umayyads or descendants of Umayya,\r\nwhich had always taken a leading part in the opposition to Muḥammad,\r\nthough ‘Uthmán himself was among the Prophet's first disciples. He was a\r\npious, well-meaning old man--an easy tool in the hands of his ambitious\r\nkinsfolk. They soon climbed into all the most lucrative and important\r\noffices and lived on the fat of the land, while too often their ungodly\r\nbehaviour gave point to the question whether these converts of the\r\neleventh hour were not still heathens at heart. Other causes contributed\r\nto excite a general discontent. The rapid growth of luxury and\r\nimmorality in the Holy Cities as well as in the new settlements was an\r\neyesore to devout Moslems. The true Islamic aristocracy, the Companions\r\nof the Prophet, headed by ‘Alí, Ṭalḥa, and Zubayr, strove to undermine\r\nthe rival nobility which threatened them with destruction. The factious\r\nsoldiery were ripe for revolt against Umayyad arrogance and greed.\r\nRebellion broke out, and finally the aged Caliph, after enduring a siege\r\nof several weeks, was murdered in his own house. This event marks an\r\nepoch in the history of the Arabs. The ensuing civil wars rent the unity\r\nof Islam from top to bottom, and the wound has never healed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Alí elected Caliph (656 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of ‘Alí.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His apotheosis.]\r\n\r\n‘Alí, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, who had hitherto remained in\r\nthe background, was now made Caliph. Although the suspicion that he was\r\nin league with the murderers may be put aside, he showed culpable\r\nweakness in leaving ‘Uthmán to his fate without an effort to save him.\r\nBut ‘Alí had almost every virtue except those of the ruler: energy,\r\ndecision, and foresight. He was a gallant warrior, a wise counsellor, a\r\ntrue friend, and a generous foe. He excelled in poetry and in eloquence;\r\nhis verses and sayings are famous throughout the Muḥammadan East, though\r\nfew of them can be considered authentic. A fine spirit worthy to be\r\ncompared with Montrose and Bayard, he had no talent for the stern\r\nrealities of statecraft, and was overmatched by unscrupulous rivals who\r\nknew that \"war is a game of deceit.\" Thus his career was in one sense a\r\nfailure: his authority as Caliph was never admitted, while he lived, by\r\nthe whole community. On the other hand, he has exerted, down to the\r\npresent day, a posthumous influence only second to that of Muḥammad\r\nhimself. Within a century of his death he came to be regarded as the\r\nProphet's successor _jure divino_; as a blessed martyr, sinless and\r\ninfallible; and by some even as an incarnation of God. The ‘Alí of\r\nShí‘ite legend is not an historical figure glorified: rather does he\r\nsymbolise, in purely mythical fashion, the religious aspirations and\r\npolitical aims of a large section of the Moslem world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Alí against Mu‘áwiya.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Ṣiffín (657 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arbitration.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The award.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Khárijites revolt against ‘Alí.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alí assassinated (661 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nTo return to our narrative. No sooner was ‘Alí proclaimed Caliph by the\r\nvictorious rebels than Mu‘áwiya b. Abí Sufyán, the governor of Syria,\r\nraised the cry of vengeance for ‘Uthmán and refused to take the oath of\r\nallegiance. As head of the Umayyad family, Mu‘áwiya might justly demand\r\nthat the murderers of his kinsman should be punished, but the contest\r\nbetween him and ‘Alí was virtually for the Caliphate. A great battle was\r\nfought at Ṣiffín, a village on the Euphrates. ‘Alí had well-nigh gained\r\nthe day when Mu‘áwiya bethought him of a stratagem. He ordered his\r\ntroops to fix Korans on the points of their lances and to shout, \"Here\r\nis the Book of God: let it decide between us!\" The miserable trick\r\nsucceeded. In ‘Alí's army there were many pious fanatics to whom the\r\nproposed arbitration by the Koran appealed with irresistible force. They\r\nnow sprang forward clamorously, threatening to betray their leader\r\nunless he would submit his cause to the Book. Vainly did ‘Alí\r\nremonstrate with the mutineers, and warn them of the trap into which\r\nthey were driving him, and this too at the moment when victory was\r\nwithin their grasp. He had no choice but to yield and name as his umpire\r\na man of doubtful loyalty, Abú Músá al-Ash‘arí, one of the oldest\r\nsurviving Companions of the Prophet. Mu‘áwiya on his part named ‘Amr b.\r\nal-‘Áṣ, whose cunning had prompted the decisive manœuvre. When the\r\numpires came forth to give judgment, Abú Músá rose and in accordance\r\nwith what had been arranged at the preliminary conference pronounced\r\nthat both ‘Alí and Mu‘áwiya should be deposed and that the people should\r\nelect a proper Caliph in their stead. \"Lo,\" said he, laying down his\r\nsword, \"even thus do I depose ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib.\" Then ‘Amr advanced and\r\nspoke as follows: \"O people! ye have heard the judgment of my colleague.\r\nHe has called you to witness that he deposes ‘Alí. Now I call you to\r\nwitness that I confirm Mu‘áwiya, even as I make fast this sword of\r\nmine,\" and suiting the action to the word, he returned it to its sheath.\r\nIt is characteristic of Arabian notions of morality that this impudent\r\nfraud was hailed by Mu‘áwiya's adherents as a diplomatic triumph which\r\ngave him a colourable pretext for assuming the title of Caliph. Both\r\nsides prepared to renew the struggle, but in the meanwhile ‘Alí found\r\nhis hands full nearer home. A numerous party among his troops, including\r\nthe same zealots who had forced arbitration upon him, now cast him off\r\nbecause he had accepted it, fell out from the ranks, and raised the\r\nstandard of revolt. These 'Outgoers,' or Khárijites, as they were\r\ncalled, maintained their theocratic principles with desperate courage,\r\nand though often defeated took the field again and again. ‘Alí's plans\r\nfor recovering Syria were finally abandoned in 660, when he concluded\r\npeace with Mu‘áwiya, and shortly afterwards he was struck down in the\r\nMosque at Kúfa, which he had made his capital, by Ibn Muljam, a\r\nKhárijite conspirator.\r\n\r\nWith ‘Alí's fall our sketch of the Orthodox Caliphate may fitly end. It\r\nwas necessary to give some account of these years so vital in the\r\nhistory of Islam, even at the risk of wearying the reader, who will\r\nperhaps wish that less space were devoted to political affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Umayyad dynasty.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moslem tradition hostile to the Umayyads.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mu‘áwiya's clemency.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His hours of study.]\r\n\r\nThe Umayyads came into power, but, except in Syria and Egypt, they ruled\r\nsolely by the sword. As descendants and representatives of the pagan\r\naristocracy, which strove with all its might to defeat Muḥammad, they\r\nwere usurpers in the eyes of the Moslem community which they claimed to\r\nlead as his successors.[362] We shall see, a little further on, how this\r\nopposition expressed itself in two great parties: the Shí‘ites or\r\nfollowers of ‘Alí, and the radical sect of the Khárijites, who have been\r\nmentioned above; and how it was gradually reinforced by the non-Arabian\r\nMoslems until it overwhelmed the Umayyad Government and set up the\r\n‘Abbásids in their place. In estimating the character of the Umayyads\r\none must bear in mind that the epitaph on the fallen dynasty was\r\ncomposed by their enemies, and can no more be considered historically\r\ntruthful than the lurid picture which Tacitus has drawn of the Emperor\r\nTiberius. Because they kept the revolutionary forces in check with\r\nruthless severity, the Umayyads pass for bloodthirsty tyrants; whereas\r\nthe best of them at any rate were strong and singularly capable rulers,\r\nbad Moslems and good men of the world, seldom cruel, plain livers if not\r\nhigh thinkers; who upon the whole stand as much above the ‘Abbásids in\r\nmorality as below them in culture and intellect. Mu‘áwiya's clemency was\r\nproverbial, though he too could be stern on occasion. When members of\r\nthe house of ‘Alí came to visit him at Damascus, which was now the\r\ncapital of the Muḥammadan Empire, he gave them honourable lodging and\r\nentertainment and was anxious to do what they asked; but they (relates\r\nthe historian approvingly) used to address him in the rudest terms and\r\naffront him in the vilest manner: sometimes he would answer them with a\r\njest, and another time he would feign not to hear, and he always\r\ndismissed them with splendid presents and ample donations.[363] \"I do\r\nnot employ my sword,\" he said, \"when my whip suffices me, nor my whip\r\nwhen my tongue suffices me; and were there but a single hair (of\r\nfriendship) between me and my subjects, I would not let it be\r\nsnapped.\"[364] After the business of the day he sought relaxation in\r\nbooks. \"He consecrated a third part of every night to the history of the\r\nArabs and their famous battles; the history of foreign peoples, their\r\nkings, and their government; the biographies of monarchs, including\r\ntheir wars and stratagems and methods of rule; and other matters\r\nconnected with Ancient History.\"[365]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ziyád ibn Abíhi.]\r\n\r\nMu‘áwiya's chief henchman was Ziyád, the son of Sumayya (Sumayya being\r\nthe name of his mother), or, as he is generally called, Ziyád ibn Abíhi,\r\n_i.e._, 'Ziyád his father's son,' for none knew who was his sire, though\r\nrumour pointed to Abú Sufyán; in which case Ziyád would have been\r\nMu‘áwiya's half-brother. Mu‘áwiya, instead of disavowing the scandalous\r\nimputation, acknowledged him as such, and made him governor of Baṣra,\r\nwhere he ruled the Eastern provinces with a rod of iron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Yazíd (680-683 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nMu‘áwiya was a crafty diplomatist--he has been well compared to\r\nRichelieu--whose profound knowledge of human nature enabled him to gain\r\nover men of moderate opinions in all the parties opposed to him. Events\r\nwere soon to prove the hollowness of this outward reconciliation. Yazíd,\r\nwho succeeded his father, was the son of Maysún, a Bedouin woman whom\r\nMu‘áwiya married before he rose to be Caliph. The luxury of Damascus had\r\nno charm for her wild spirit, and she gave utterance to her feeling of\r\nhomesickness in melancholy verse:--\r\n\r\n \"A tent with rustling breezes cool\r\n  Delights me more than palace high,\r\n  And more the cloak of simple wool\r\n  Than robes in which I learned to sigh.\r\n\r\n  The crust I ate beside my tent\r\n  Was more than this fine bread to me;\r\n  The wind's voice where the hill-path went\r\n  Was more than tambourine can be.\r\n\r\n  And more than purr of friendly cat\r\n  I love the watch-dog's bark to hear;\r\n  And more than any lubbard fat\r\n  I love a Bedouin cavalier.\"[366]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥusayn marches on Kúfa.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Ḥusayn and his followers at Karbalá (10th\r\nMuḥarram, 61 A.H. = 10th October, 680 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nMu‘áwiya, annoyed by the contemptuous allusion to himself, took the dame\r\nat her word. She returned to her own family, and Yazíd grew up as a\r\nBedouin, with the instincts and tastes which belong to the\r\nBedouins--love of pleasure, hatred of piety, and reckless disregard for\r\nthe laws of religion. The beginning of his reign was marked by an event\r\nof which even now few Moslems can speak without a thrill of horror and\r\ndismay. The facts are briefly these: In the autumn of the year 680\r\nḤusayn, the son of ‘Alí, claiming to be the rightful Caliph in virtue of\r\nhis descent from the Prophet, quitted Mecca with his whole family and a\r\nnumber of devoted friends, and set out for Kúfa, where he expected the\r\npopulation, which was almost entirely Shí‘ite, to rally to his cause. It\r\nwas a foolhardy adventure. The poet Farazdaq, who knew the fickle temper\r\nof his fellow-townsmen, told Ḥusayn that although their hearts were with\r\nhim, their swords would be with the Umayyads; but his warning was given\r\nin vain. Meanwhile ‘Ubaydulláh b. Ziyád, the governor of Kúfa, having\r\noverawed the insurgents in the city and beheaded their leader, Muslim b.\r\n‘Aqíl, who was a cousin of Ḥusayn, sent a force of cavalry with orders\r\nto bring the arch-rebel to a stand. Retreat was still open to him. But\r\nhis followers cried out that the blood of Muslim must be avenged, and\r\nḤusayn could not hesitate. Turning northward along the Euphrates, he\r\nencamped at Karbalá with his little band, which, including the women and\r\nchildren, amounted to some two hundred souls. In this hopeless situation\r\nhe offered terms which might have been accepted if Shamir b. Dhi\r\n’l-Jawshan, a name for ever infamous and accursed, had not persuaded\r\n‘Ubaydulláh to insist on unconditional surrender. The demand was\r\nrefused, and Ḥusayn drew up his comrades--a handful of men and boys--for\r\nbattle against the host which surrounded them. All the harrowing details\r\ninvented by grief and passion can scarcely heighten the tragedy of the\r\nclosing scene. It would appear that the Umayyad officers themselves\r\nshrank from the odium of a general massacre, and hoped to take the\r\nProphet's grandson alive. Shamir, however, had no such scruples. Chafing\r\nat delay, he urged his soldiers to the assault. The unequal struggle was\r\nsoon over. Ḥusayn fell, pierced by an arrow, and his brave followers\r\nwere cut down beside him to the last man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differing views of Muḥammadan and European writers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Umayyads judged by Islam.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Yazíd.]\r\n\r\nMuḥammadan tradition, which with rare exceptions is uniformly hostile to\r\nthe Umayyad dynasty, regards Ḥusayn as a martyr and Yazíd as his\r\nmurderer; while modern historians, for the most part, agree with Sir W.\r\nMuir, who points out that Ḥusayn, \"having yielded himself to a\r\ntreasonable, though impotent design upon the throne, was committing an\r\noffence that endangered society and demanded swift suppression.\" This\r\nwas naturally the view of the party in power, and the reader must form\r\nhis own conclusion as to how far it justifies the action which they\r\ntook. For Moslems the question is decided by the relation of the\r\nUmayyads to Islam. Violators of its laws and spurners of its ideals,\r\nthey could never be anything but tyrants; and being tyrants, they had no\r\nright to slay believers who rose in arms against their usurped\r\nauthority. The so-called verdict of history, when we come to examine it,\r\nis seen to be the verdict of religion, the judgment of theocratic Islam\r\non Arabian Imperialism. On this ground the Umayyads are justly\r\ncondemned, but it is well to remember that in Moslem eyes the\r\ndistinction between Church and State does not exist. Yazíd was a bad\r\nChurchman: therefore he was a wicked tyrant; the one thing involves the\r\nother. From our unprejudiced standpoint, he was an amiable prince who\r\ninherited his mother's poetic talent, and infinitely preferred wine,\r\nmusic, and sport to the drudgery of public affairs. The Syrian Arabs,\r\nwho recognised the Umayyads as legitimate, thought highly of him:\r\n\"Jucundissimus,\" says a Christian writer, \"et cunctis nationibus regni\r\nejus subditis vir gratissime habitus, qui nullam unquam, ut omnibus\r\nmoris est, sibi regalis fastigii causa gloriam appetivit, sed communis\r\ncum omnibus civiliter vixit.\"[367] He deplored the fate of the women and\r\nchildren of Ḥusayn's family, treated them with every mark of respect,\r\nand sent them to Medína, where their account of the tragedy added fresh\r\nfuel to the hatred and indignation with which its authors were generally\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nThe Umayyads had indeed ample cause to rue the day of Karbalá. It gave\r\nthe Shí‘ite faction a rallying-cry--\"Vengeance for Ḥusayn!\"--which was\r\ntaken up on all sides, and especially by the Persian _Mawálí_, or\r\nClients, who longed for deliverance from the Arab yoke. Their\r\namalgamation with the Shí‘a--a few years later they flocked in thousands\r\nto the standard of Mukhtár--was an event of the utmost historical\r\nimportance, which will be discussed when we come to speak of the\r\nShí‘ites in particular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medína and Mecca desecrated (682-3 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rebellion of Mukhtár (685-6 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of Ḥusayn does not complete the tale of Yazíd's\r\nenormities. Medína, the Prophet's city, having expelled its Umayyad\r\ngovernor, was sacked by a Syrian army, while Mecca itself, where\r\n‘Abdulláh b. Zubayr had set up as rival Caliph, was besieged, and the\r\nKa‘ba laid in ruins. These outrages, shocking to Moslem sentiment,\r\nkindled a flame of rebellion. Ḥusayn was avenged by Mukhtár, who seized\r\nKúfa and executed some three hundred of the guilty citizens, including\r\nthe miscreant Shamir. His troops defeated and slew ‘Ubaydulláh b. Ziyád,\r\nbut he himself was slain, not long afterwards, by Mus‘ab, the brother of\r\nIbn Zubayr, and seven thousand of his followers were massacred in cold\r\nblood. On Yazíd's death (683) the Umayyad Empire threatened to fall to\r\npieces. As a contemporary poet sang--\r\n\r\n \"Now loathed of all men is the Fury blind\r\n  Which blazeth as a fire blown by the wind.\r\n  They are split in sects: each province hath its own\r\n  Commander of the Faithful, each its throne.\"[368]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war renewed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivalry of Northern and Southern Arabs.]\r\n\r\nFierce dissensions broke out among the Syrian Arabs, the backbone of the\r\ndynasty. The great tribal groups of Kalb and Qays, whose coalition had\r\nhitherto maintained the Umayyads in power, fought on opposite sides at\r\nMarj Ráhiṭ (684), the former for Marwán and the latter for Ibn Zubayr.\r\nMarwán's victory secured the allegiance of Syria, but henceforth Qays\r\nand Kalb were always at daggers drawn.[369] This was essentially a feud\r\nbetween the Northern and the Southern Arabs--a feud which rapidly\r\nextended and developed into a permanent racial enmity. They carried it\r\nwith them to the farthest ends of the world, so that, for example, after\r\nthe conquest of Spain precautions had to be taken against civil war by\r\nproviding that Northerners and Southerners should not settle in the same\r\ndistricts. The literary history of this antagonism has been sketched by\r\nDr. Goldziher with his wonted erudition and acumen.[370] Satire was, of\r\ncourse, the principal weapon of both sides. Here is a fragment by a\r\nNorthern poet which belongs to the Umayyad period:--\r\n\r\n \"Negroes are better, when they name their sires,\r\n  Than Qaḥṭán's sons,[371] the uncircumcisèd cowards:\r\n  A folk whom thou mayst see, at war's outflame,\r\n  More abject than a shoe to tread in baseness;\r\n  Their women free to every lecher's lust,\r\n  Their clients spoil for cavaliers and footmen.\"[372]\r\n\r\nThus the Arab nation was again torn asunder by the old tribal\r\npretensions which Muḥammad sought to abolish. That they ultimately\r\nproved fatal to the Umayyads is no matter for surprise; the sorely\r\npressed dynasty was already tottering, its enemies were at its gates. By\r\ngood fortune it produced at this crisis an exceptionally able and\r\nvigorous ruler, ‘Abdu ’l-Malik b. Marwán, who not only saved his house\r\nfrom destruction, but re-established its supremacy and inaugurated a\r\nmore brilliant epoch than any that had gone before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Abdu ’l-Malik and his successors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reforms of ‘Abdu ’l-Malik.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The writing of Arabic.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥajjáj b. Yúsuf († 714 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n‘Abdu ’l-Malik succeeded his father in 685, but required seven years of\r\nhard fighting to make good his claim to the Caliphate. When his most\r\nformidable rival, Ibn Zubayr, had fallen in battle (692), the eastern\r\nprovinces were still overrun by rebels, who offered a desperate\r\nresistance to the governor of ‘Iráq, the iron-handed Ḥajjáj. But\r\nenough of bloodshed. Peace also had her victories during the troubled\r\nreign of ‘Abdu ’l-Malik and the calmer sway of his successors. Four of\r\nthe next five Caliphs were his own sons--Walíd (705-715), Sulaymán\r\n(715-717), Yazíd II (720-724), and Hishám (724-743); the fifth, ‘Umar\r\nII, was the son of his brother, ‘Abdu ’l-‘Azíz. For the greater part of\r\nthis time the Moslem lands enjoyed a well-earned interval of repose and\r\nprosperity, which mitigated, though it could not undo, the frightful\r\ndevastation wrought by twenty years of almost continuous civil war. Many\r\nreforms were introduced, some wholly political in character, while\r\nothers inspired by the same motives have, none the less, a direct\r\nbearing on literary history. ‘Abdu ’l-Malik organised an excellent\r\npostal service, by means of relays of horses, for the conveyance of\r\ndespatches and travellers; he substituted for the Byzantine and Persian\r\ncoins, which had hitherto been in general use, new gold and silver\r\npieces, on which be caused sentences from the Koran to be engraved; and\r\nhe made Arabic, instead of Greek or Persian, the official language of\r\nfinancial administration. Steps were taken, moreover, to improve the\r\nextremely defective Arabic script, and in this way to provide a sound\r\nbasis for the study and interpretation of the Koran as well as for the\r\ncollection of _ḥadíths_ or sayings of the Prophet, which form an\r\nindispensable supplement thereto. The Arabic alphabet, as it was then\r\nwritten, consisted entirely of consonants, so that, to give an\r\nillustration from English, _bnd_ might denote _band_, _bend_, _bind_, or\r\n_bond_; _crt_ might stand for _cart_, _carat_, _curt_, and so on. To an\r\nArab this ambiguity mattered little; far worse confusion arose from the\r\ncircumstance that many of the consonants themselves were exactly alike:\r\nthus, _e.g._, it was possible to read the same combination of three\r\nletters as _bnt_, _nbt_, _byt_, _tnb_, _ntb_, _nyb_, and in various\r\nother ways. Considering the difficulties of the Arabic language, which\r\nare so great that a European aided by scientific grammars and\r\nunequivocal texts will often find himself puzzled even when he has\r\nbecome tolerably familiar with it, one may imagine that the Koran was\r\nvirtually a sealed book to all but a few among the crowds of foreigners\r\nwho accepted Islam after the early conquests. ‘Abdu’l-Malik's viceroy\r\nin ‘Iráq, the famous Ḥajjáj, who began life as a schoolmaster,\r\nexerted himself to promote the use of vowel-marks (borrowed from the\r\nSyriac) and of the diacritical points placed above or below similar\r\nconsonants. This extraordinary man deserves more than a passing mention.\r\nA stern disciplinarian, who could be counted upon to do his duty without\r\nany regard to public opinion, he was chosen by ‘Abdu ’l-Malik to besiege\r\nMecca, which Ibn Zubayr was holding as anti-Caliph. Ḥajjáj bombarded\r\nthe city, defeated the Pretender, and sent his head to Damascus. Two\r\nyears afterwards he became governor of ‘Iráq. Entering the Mosque at\r\nKúfa, he mounted the pulpit and introduced himself to the assembled\r\ntownsmen in these memorable words:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His service to literature.]\r\n\r\n \"I am he who scattereth the darkness and climbeth o'er the summits.\r\n  When I lift the turban from my face, ye will know me.[373]\r\n\r\n\"O people of Kúfa! I see heads that are ripe for cutting, and I am the\r\nman to do it; and methinks, I see blood between the turbans and\r\nbeards.\"[374] The rest of his speech was in keeping with the\r\ncommencement. He used no idle threats, as the malcontents soon found\r\nout. Rebellion, which had been rampant before his arrival, was rapidly\r\nextinguished. \"He restored order in ‘Iráq and subdued its people.\"[375]\r\nFor twenty years his despotic rule gave peace and security to the\r\nEastern world. Cruel he may have been, though the tales of his\r\nbloodthirstiness are beyond doubt grossly exaggerated, but it should be\r\nput to his credit that he established and maintained the settled\r\nconditions which afford leisure for the cultivation of learning. Under\r\nhis protection the Koran and Traditions were diligently studied both in\r\nKúfa and Baṣra, where many Companions of the Prophet had made their\r\nhome: hence arose in Baṣra the science of Grammar, with which, as we\r\nshall see in a subsequent page, the name of that city is peculiarly\r\nassociated. Ḥajjáj shared the literary tastes of his sovereign; he\r\nadmired the old poets and patronised the new; he was a master of terse\r\neloquence and plumed himself on his elegant Arabic style. The most hated\r\nman of his time, he lives in history as the savage oppressor and butcher\r\nof God-fearing Moslems. He served the Umayyads well and faithfully, and\r\nwhen he died in 714 A.D. he left behind him nothing but his Koran, his\r\narms, and a few hundred pieces of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Walíd (705-715 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moslem conquests in the East.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of Spain (711-713 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nIt was a common saying at Damascus that under Walíd people talked of\r\nfine buildings, under Sulaymán of cookery and the fair sex, while in the\r\nreign of ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Azíz the Koran and religion formed favourite\r\ntopics of conversation.[376] Of Walíd's passion for architecture we have\r\na splendid monument in the Great Mosque of Damascus (originally the\r\nCathedral of St. John), which is the principal sight of the city to this\r\nday. He spoke Arabic very incorrectly, and though his father rebuked\r\nhim, observing that \"in order to rule the Arabs one must be proficient\r\nin their language,\" he could never learn to express himself with\r\npropriety.[377] The unbroken peace which now prevailed within the Empire\r\nenabled Walíd to resume the work of conquest. In the East his armies\r\ninvaded Transoxania, captured Bokhárá and Samarcand, and pushed forward\r\nto the Chinese frontier. Another force crossed the Indus and penetrated\r\nas far as Múltán, a renowned centre of pilgrimage in the Southern\r\nPunjaub, which fell into the hands of the Moslems after a prolonged\r\nsiege. But the most brilliant advance, and the richest in its results,\r\nwas that in the extreme West, which decided the fate of Spain. Although\r\nthe Moslems had obtained a footing in Northern Africa some thirty years\r\nbefore this time, their position was always precarious, until in 709\r\nMúsá b. Nuṣayr completely subjugated the Berbers, and extended not only\r\nthe dominion but also the faith of Islam to the Atlantic Ocean. Two\r\nyears later his freedman Ṭáriq crossed the straits and took possession\r\nof the commanding height, called by the ancients Calpe, but henceforth\r\nknown as Jabal Ṭáriq (Gibraltar). Roderic, the last of the West Gothic\r\ndynasty, gathered an army in defence of his kingdom, but there were\r\ntraitors in the camp, and, though he himself fought valiantly, their\r\ndefection turned the fortunes of the day. The king fled, and it was\r\nnever ascertained what became of him. Ṭáriq, meeting with feeble\r\nresistance, marched rapidly on Toledo, while Músá, whose jealousy was\r\nexcited by the triumphal progress of his lieutenant, now joined in the\r\ncampaign, and, storming city after city, reached the Pyrenees. The\r\nconquest of Spain, which is told by Moslem historians with many romantic\r\ncircumstances, marks the nearest approach that the Arabs ever made to\r\nWorld-Empire. Their advance on French soil was finally hurled back by\r\nCharles the Hammer's great victory at Tours (732 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Azíz (717-720 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of the Umayyads we must not forget to mention ‘Umar\r\nb. ‘Abd al-‘Azíz, a ruler who stands out in singular contrast with his\r\npredecessors, and whose brief reign is regarded by many Moslems as the\r\nsole bright spot in a century of godless and bloodstained tyranny. There\r\nhad been nothing like it since the days of his illustrious namesake and\r\nkinsman,[378] ‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭáb, and we shall find nothing like it in\r\nthe future history of the Caliphate. Plato desired that every king\r\nshould be a philosopher: according to Muḥammadan theory every Caliph\r\nought to be a saint. ‘Umar satisfied these aspirations. When he came to\r\nthe throne the following dialogue is said to have occurred between him\r\nand one of his favourites, Sálim al-Suddí:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  ‘Umar: \"Are you glad on account of my accession, or sorry?\"\r\n\r\n  Sálim: \"I am glad for the people's sake, but sorry for yours.\"\r\n\r\n  ‘Umar: \"I fear that I have brought perdition upon my soul.\"\r\n\r\n  Sálim: \"If you are afraid, very good. I only fear that you may\r\n            cease to be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n  ‘Umar: \"Give me a word of counsel.\"\r\n\r\n  Sálim: \"Our father Adam was driven forth from Paradise because\r\n            of one sin.\"[379]\r\n\r\nPoets and orators found no favour at his court, which was thronged by\r\ndivines and men of ascetic life.[380] He warned his governors that they\r\nmust either deal justly or go. He would not allow political\r\nconsiderations to interfere with his ideal of righteousness, but, as\r\nWellhausen points out, he had practical ends in view: his piety made him\r\nanxious for the common weal no less than for his own salvation. Whether\r\nhe administered the State successfully is a matter of dispute. It has\r\nbeen generally supposed that his financial reforms were Utopian in\r\ncharacter and disastrous to the Exchequer.[381] However this may be, he\r\nshowed wisdom in seeking to bridge the menacing chasm between Islam and\r\nthe Imperial house. Thus, _e.g._, he did away with the custom which had\r\nlong prevailed of cursing ‘Alí from the pulpit at Friday prayers. The\r\npolicy of conciliation was tried too late, and for too short a space, to\r\nbe effective; but it was not entirely fruitless. When, on the overthrow\r\nof the Umayyad dynasty, the tombs of the hated 'tyrants' were defiled\r\nand their bodies disinterred, ‘Umar's grave alone was respected, and\r\nMas‘údí († 956 A.D.) tells us that in his time it was visited by crowds\r\nof pilgrims.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hishám and Walíd II.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining Umayyads do not call for particular notice. Hishám ranks\r\nas a statesman with Mu‘áwiya and ‘Abdu ’l-Malik: the great ‘Abbásid\r\nCaliph, Manṣúr, is said to have admired and imitated his methods of\r\ngovernment.[382] Walíd II was an incorrigible libertine, whose songs\r\ncelebrating the forbidden delights of wine have much merit. The eminent\r\npoet and freethinker, Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí, quotes these verses by\r\nhim[383]:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Verses by Walíd II (743-4 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n \"The Imám Walíd am I! In all my glory\r\n  Of trailing robes I listen to soft lays.\r\n  When proudly I sweep on towards her chamber,\r\n  I care not who inveighs.\r\n\r\n  There's no true joy but lending ear to music,\r\n  Or wine that leaves one sunk in stupor dense.\r\n  Houris in Paradise I do not look for:\r\n  Does any man of sense?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from the monarchs to their subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political and religious movements of the period.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place we shall speak of the political and religious\r\nparties, whose opposition to the Umayyad House gradually undermined its\r\ninfluence and in the end brought about its fall. Some account will be\r\ngiven of the ideas for which these parties fought and of the causes of\r\ntheir discontent with the existing _régime_. Secondly, a few words must\r\nbe said of the theological and more purely religious sects--the\r\nMu‘tazilites, Murjites, and Ṣúfís; and, lastly, of the extant\r\nliterature, which is almost exclusively poetical, and its leading\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Arabs of ‘Iráq.]\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the Umayyads was at first mainly a question of\r\npolitics. Mu‘áwiya's accession announced the triumph of Syria over\r\n‘Iráq, and Damascus, instead of Kúfa, became the capital of the Empire.\r\nAs Wellhausen observes, \"the most powerful risings against the Umayyads\r\nproceeded from ‘Iráq, not from any special party, but from the whole\r\nmass of the Arabs settled there, who were united in resenting the loss\r\nof their independence (_Selbstherrlichkeit_) and in hating those into\r\nwhose hands it had passed.\"[384] At the same time these feelings took a\r\nreligious colour and identified themselves with the cause of Islam. The\r\nnew government fell lamentably short of the theocratic standard by which\r\nit was judged. Therefore it was evil, and (according to the Moslem's\r\nconception of duty) every right-thinking man must work for its\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAmong the myriads striving for this consummation, and so far making\r\ncommon cause with each other, we can distinguish four principal classes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parties opposed to the Umayyad government.]\r\n\r\n(1) The religious Moslems, or Pietists, in general, who formed a wing of\r\nthe Orthodox Party.[385]\r\n\r\n(2) The Khárijites, who may be described as the Puritans and extreme\r\nRadicals of theocracy.\r\n\r\n(3) The Shí‘ites, or partisans of ‘Alí and his House.\r\n\r\n(4) The Non-Arabian Moslems, who were called _Mawálí_ (Clients).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pietists.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Pietists--including divines learned in the law,\r\nreciters of the Koran, Companions of the Prophet and their\r\ndescendants--could not but abominate the secular authority which they\r\nwere now compelled to obey. The conviction that Might, in the shape of\r\nthe tyrant and his minions, trampled on Right as represented by the\r\nKoran and the _Sunna_ (custom of Muḥammad) drove many into active\r\nrebellion: five thousand are said to have perished in the sack of Medína\r\nalone. Others again, like Ḥasan of Baṣra, filled with profound despair,\r\nshut their eyes on the world, and gave themselves up to asceticism, a\r\ntendency which had important consequences, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Khárijites.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Nahrawán (658 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Khárijite risings.]\r\n\r\nWhen ‘Alí, on the field of Ṣiffín, consented that the claims of Mu‘áwiya\r\nand himself to the Caliphate should be decided by arbitration, a large\r\nsection of his army accused him of having betrayed his trust. He, the\r\nduly elected Caliph--so they argued--should have maintained the dignity\r\nof his high office inviolate at all costs. On the homeward march the\r\nmalcontents, some twelve thousand in number, broke away and encamped by\r\nthemselves at Ḥarúrá, a village near Kúfa. Their cry was, \"God alone can\r\ndecide\" (_lá ḥukma illá lilláhi_): in these terms they protested against\r\nthe arbitration. ‘Alí endeavoured to win them back, but without any\r\nlasting success. They elected a Caliph from among themselves, and\r\ngathered at Nahrawán, four thousand strong. On the appearance of ‘Alí\r\nwith a vastly superior force many of the rebels dispersed, but the\r\nremainder--about half--preferred to die for their faith. Nahrawán was to\r\nthe Khárijites what Karbalá afterwards became to the Shí‘ites, who from\r\nthis day were regarded by the former as their chief enemies. Frequent\r\nKhárijite risings took place during the early Umayyad period, but the\r\nmovement reached its zenith in the years of confusion which followed\r\nYazíd's death. The Azraqites, so called after their leader, Náfi‘ b.\r\nal-Azraq, overran ‘Iráq and Southern Persia, while another sect, the\r\nNajdites, led by Najda b. ‘Ámir, reduced the greater part of Arabia to\r\nsubmission. The insurgents held their ground for a long time against\r\n‘Abdu ’l-Malik, and did not cease from troubling until the rebellion\r\nheaded by Shabíb was at last stamped out by Ḥajjáj in 697.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meaning of 'Khárijite.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their political theories.]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the name _Khárijí_ (plural, _Khawárij_)\r\nrefers to a passage in the Koran (iv, 101) where mention is made of\r\n\"those who go forth (_yakhruj_) from their homes as emigrants\r\n(_muhájiran_) to God and His Messenger\"; so that 'Khárijite' means 'one\r\nwho leaves his home among the unbelievers for God's sake,' and\r\ncorresponds to the term _Muhájir_, which was applied to the Meccan\r\nconverts who accompanied the Prophet in his migration to Medína.[386]\r\nAnother name by which they are often designated is likewise Koranic in\r\norigin, viz., _Shurát_ (plural of _Shárin_): literally 'Sellers'--that\r\nis to say, those who sell their lives and goods in return for\r\nParadise.[387] The Khárijites were mostly drawn from the Bedouin\r\nsoldiery who settled in Baṣra and Kúfa after the Persian wars. Civil\r\nlife wrought little change in their unruly temper. Far from\r\nacknowledging the peculiar sanctity of a Qurayshite, they desired a\r\nchief of their own blood whom they might obey, in Bedouin fashion, as\r\nlong as he did not abuse or exceed the powers conferred upon him.[388]\r\nThe mainspring of the movement, however, was pietistic, and can be\r\ntraced, as Wellhausen has shown, to the Koran-readers who made it a\r\nmatter of conscience that ‘Alí should avow his contrition for the fatal\r\nerror which their own temporary and deeply regretted infatuation had\r\nforced him to commit. They cast off ‘Alí for the same reason which led\r\nthem to strike at ‘Uthman: in both cases they were maintaining the cause\r\nof God against an unjust Caliph.[389] It is important to remember these\r\nfacts in view of the cardinal Khárijite doctrines (1) that every free\r\nArab was eligible as Caliph,[390] and (2) that an evil-doing Caliph must\r\nbe deposed and, if necessary, put to death. Mustawrid b. ‘Ullifa, the\r\nKhárijite 'Commander of the Faithful,' wrote to Simák b. ‘Ubayd, the\r\ngovernor of Ctesiphon, as follows: \"We call you to the Book of God\r\nAlmighty and Glorious, and to the _Sunna_ (custom) of the Prophet--on\r\nwhom be peace!--and to the administration of Abú Bakr and ‘Umar--may God\r\nbe well pleased with them!--and to renounce ‘Uthmán and ‘Alí because\r\nthey corrupted the true religion and abandoned the authority of the\r\nBook.\"[391] From this it appears that the Khárijite programme was simply\r\nthe old Islam of equality and fraternity, which had never been fully\r\nrealised and was now irretrievably ruined. Theoretically, all devout\r\nMoslems shared in the desire for its restoration and condemned the\r\nexisting Government no less cordially than did the Khárijites. What\r\ndistinguished the latter party was the remorseless severity with which\r\nthey carried their principles into action. To them it was absolutely\r\nvital that the Imám, or head of the community, should rule in the name\r\nand according to the will of God: those who followed any other sealed\r\ntheir doom in the next world: eternal salvation hung upon the choice of\r\na successor to the Prophet. Moslems who refused to execrate ‘Uthmán and\r\n‘Alí were the worst of infidels; it was the duty of every true believer\r\nto take part in the Holy War against such, and to kill them, together\r\nwith their wives and children. These atrocities recoiled upon the\r\ninsurgents, who soon found themselves in danger of extermination. Milder\r\ncounsels began to prevail. Thus the Ibáḍites (followers of ‘Abdulláh b.\r\nIbáḍ) held it lawful to live amongst the Moslems and mix with them on\r\nterms of mutual tolerance. But compromise was in truth incompatible with\r\nthe _raison d'être_ of the Khárijites, namely, to establish the kingdom\r\nof God upon the earth. This meant virtual anarchy: \"their unbending\r\nlogic shattered every constitution which it set up.\" As ‘Alí remarked,\r\n\"they say, 'No government' (_lá imára_), but there must be a government,\r\ngood or bad.\"[392] Nevertheless, it was a noble ideal for which they\r\nfought in pure devotion, having, unlike the other political parties, no\r\nworldly interests to serve.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their religion.]\r\n\r\nThe same fierce spirit of fanaticism moulded their religious views,\r\nwhich were gloomy and austere, as befitted the chosen few in an ungodly\r\nworld. Shahrastání, speaking of the original twelve thousand who\r\nrebelled against ‘Alí, describes them as 'people of fasting and prayer'\r\n(_ahlu ṣiyámin wa-ṣalátin_).[393] The Koran ruled their lives and\r\npossessed their imaginations, so that the history of the early Church,\r\nthe persecutions, martyrdoms, and triumphs of the Faith became a\r\nveritable drama which was being enacted by themselves. The fear of hell\r\nkindled in them an inquisitorial zeal for righteousness. They\r\nscrupulously examined their own belief as well as that of their\r\nneighbours, and woe to him that was found wanting! A single false step\r\ninvolved excommunication from the pale of Islam, and though the slip\r\nmight be condoned on proof of sincere repentance, any Moslem who had\r\nonce committed a mortal sin (_kabíra_) was held, by the stricter\r\nKhárijites at least, to be inevitably damned with the infidels in\r\neverlasting fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Khárijite poetry.]\r\n\r\nMuch might be written, if space allowed, concerning the wars of the\r\nKhárijites, their most famous chiefs, the points on which they\r\nquarrelled, and the sects into which they split. Here we can only\r\nattempt to illustrate the general character of the movement. We have\r\ntouched on its political and religious aspects, and shall now conclude\r\nwith some reference to its literary side. The Khárijites did not produce\r\na Milton or a Bunyan, but as Arabs of Bedouin stock they had a natural\r\ngift of song, from which they could not be weaned; although, according\r\nto the strict letter of the Koran, poetry is a devilish invention\r\nimproper for the pious Moslem to meddle with. But these are poems of a\r\ndifferent order from the pagan odes, and breathe a stern religious\r\nenthusiasm that would have gladdened the Prophet's heart. Take, for\r\nexample, the following verses, which were made by a Khárijite in\r\nprison:--[394]\r\n\r\n \"'Tis time, O ye Sellers, for one who hath sold himself\r\n  To God, that he should arise and saddle amain.\r\n  Fools! in the land of miscreants will ye abide,\r\n  To be hunted down, every man of you, and to be slain?\r\n  O would that I were among you, armèd in mail,\r\n  On the back of my stout-ribbed galloping war-horse again!\r\n  And would that I were among you, fighting your foes,\r\n  That me, first of all, they might give death's beaker to drain!\r\n  It grieves me sore that ye are startled and chased\r\n  Like beasts, while I cannot draw on the wretches profane\r\n  My sword, nor see them scattered by noble knights\r\n  Who never yield an inch of the ground they gain,\r\n  But where the struggle is hottest, with keen blades hew\r\n  Their strenuous way and deem 'twere base to refrain.\r\n  Ay, it grieves me sore that ye are oppressed and wronged,\r\n  While I must drag in anguish a captive's chain.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Qaṭarí b. al-Fujá’a.]\r\n\r\nQaṭarí b. al-Fujá’a, the intrepid Khárijite leader who routed army\r\nafter army sent against him by Ḥajjáj, sang almost as well as he\r\nfought. The verses rendered below are included in the _Ḥamása_[395]\r\nand cited by Ibn Khallikán, who declares that they would make a brave\r\nman of the greatest coward in the world. \"I know of nothing on the\r\nsubject to be compared with them; they could only have proceeded from a\r\nspirit that scorned disgrace and from a truly Arabian sentiment of\r\nvalour.\"[396]\r\n\r\n \"I say to my soul dismayed--\r\n  'Courage! Thou canst not achieve,\r\n  With praying, an hour of life\r\n  Beyond the appointed term.\r\n  Then courage on death's dark field,\r\n  Courage! Impossible 'tis\r\n  To live for ever and aye.\r\n  Life is no hero's robe\r\n  Of honour: the dastard vile\r\n  Also doffs it at last.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Shí‘ites.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The theory of Divine Right.]\r\n\r\nThe murder of ‘Uthmán broke the Moslem community, which had hitherto\r\nbeen undivided, into two _shí‘as_, or parties--one for ‘Alí and the\r\nother for Mu‘áwiya. When the latter became Caliph he was no longer a\r\nparty leader, but head of the State, and his _shí‘a_ ceased to exist.\r\nHenceforth 'the Shí‘a' _par excellence_ was the party of ‘Alí, which\r\nregarded the House of the Prophet as the legitimate heirs to the\r\nsuccession. Not content, however, with upholding ‘Alí, as the worthiest\r\nof the Prophet's Companions and the duly elected Caliph, against his\r\nrival, Mu‘áwiya, the bolder spirits took up an idea, which emerged about\r\nthis time, that the Caliphate belonged to ‘Alí and his descendants by\r\nDivine right. Such is the distinctive doctrine of the Shí‘ites to the\r\npresent day. It is generally thought to have originated in Persia, where\r\nthe Sásánian kings used to assume the title of 'god' (Pahlaví _bagh_)\r\nand were looked upon as successive incarnations of the Divine majesty.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Dozy's account of its origin.]\r\n\r\n  \"Although the Shí‘ites,\" says Dozy, \"often found themselves under\r\n  the direction of Arab leaders, who utilised them in order to gain\r\n  some personal end, they were nevertheless a Persian sect at bottom;\r\n  and it is precisely here that the difference most clearly showed\r\n  itself between the Arab race, which loves liberty, and the Persian\r\n  race, accustomed to slavish submission. For the Persians, the\r\n  principle of electing the Prophet's successor was something unheard\r\n  of and incomprehensible. The only principle which they recognised\r\n  was that of inheritance, and since Muḥammad left no sons, they\r\n  thought that his son-in-law ‘Alí should have succeeded him, and that\r\n  the sovereignty was hereditary in his family. Consequently, all the\r\n  Caliphs except ‘Alí--_i.e._, Abú Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Uthmán, as well\r\n  as the Umayyads--were in their eyes usurpers to whom no obedience\r\n  was due. The hatred which they felt for the Government and for Arab\r\n  rule confirmed them in this opinion; at the same time they cast\r\n  covetous looks on the wealth of their masters. Habituated, moreover,\r\n  to see in their kings the descendants of the inferior divinities,\r\n  they transferred this idolatrous veneration to ‘Alí and his\r\n  posterity. Absolute obedience to the Imám of ‘Alí's House was in\r\n  their eyes the most important duty; if that were fulfilled all the\r\n  rest might be interpreted allegorically and violated without\r\n  scruple. For them the Imám was everything; he was God made man. A\r\n  servile submission accompanied by immorality was the basis of their\r\n  system.\"[397]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Saba’ites.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doctrine of Ibn Sabá.]\r\n\r\nNow, the Shí‘ite theory of Divine Right certainly harmonised with\r\nPersian ideas, but was it also of Persian origin? On the contrary, it\r\nseems first to have arisen among an obscure Arabian sect, the Saba’ites,\r\nwhose founder, ‘Abdulláh b. Sabá (properly, Saba’), was a native of\r\nṢan‘á in Yemen, and is said to have been a Jew.[398] In ‘Uthmán's time\r\nhe turned Moslem and became, apparently, a travelling missionary. \"He\r\nwent from place to place,\" says the historian, \"seeking to lead the\r\nMoslems into error.\"[399] We hear of him in the Ḥijáz, then in Baṣra and\r\nKúfa, then in Syria. Finally he settled in Egypt, where he preached the\r\ndoctrine of palingenesis (_raj‘a_). \"It is strange indeed,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"that any one should believe in the return of Jesus (as\r\nMessias), and deny the return of Muḥammad, which God has announced (Kor.\r\nxxviii, 85).[400] Furthermore, there are a thousand Prophets, every one\r\nof whom has an executor (_waṣí_), and the executor of Muḥammad is\r\n‘Alí.[401] Muḥammad is the last of the Prophets, and ‘Alí is the last of\r\nthe executors.\" Ibn Sabá, therefore, regarded Abú Bakr, ‘Umar, and\r\n‘Uthmán as usurpers. He set on foot a widespread conspiracy in favour of\r\n‘Alí, and carried on a secret correspondence with the disaffected in\r\nvarious provinces of the Empire.[402] According to Shahrastání, he was\r\nbanished by ‘Alí for saying, \"Thou art thou\" (_anta anta_), _i.e._,\r\n\"Thou art God.\"[403] This refers to the doctrine taught by Ibn Sabá and\r\nthe extreme Shí‘ites (_Ghulát_) who derive from him, that the Divine\r\nSpirit which dwells in every prophet and passes successively from one to\r\nanother was transfused, at Muḥammad's death, into ‘Alí, and from ‘Alí\r\ninto his descendants who succeeded him in the Imámate. The Saba’ites\r\nalso held that the Imám might suffer a temporary occultation (_ghayba_),\r\nbut that one day he would return and fill the earth with justice. They\r\nbelieved the millennium to be near at hand, so that the number of Imáms\r\nwas at first limited to four. Thus the poet Kuthayyir († 723 A.D.)\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n \"Four complete are the Imáms\r\n ‘Alí and his three good sons,\r\n  One was faithful and devout;\r\n  One, until with waving flags\r\n  Dwells on Mount Raḍwá, concealed:\r\n  of Quraysh, the lords of Right:\r\n  each of them a shining light.\r\n  Karbalá hid one from sight;\r\n  his horsemen he shall lead to fight,\r\n  honey he drinks and water bright.\"[404]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mahdí or Messiah.]\r\n\r\nThe Messianic idea is not peculiar to the Shí‘ites, but was brought into\r\nIslam at an early period by Jewish and Christian converts, and soon\r\nestablished itself as a part of Muḥammadan belief. Traditions ascribed\r\nto the Prophet began to circulate, declaring that the approach of the\r\nLast Judgment would be heralded by a time of tumult and confusion, by\r\nthe return of Jesus, who would slay the Antichrist (_Dajjál_), and\r\nfinally by the coming of the Mahdí, _i.e._, 'the God-guided one,' who\r\nwould fill the earth with justice even as it was then filled with\r\nviolence and iniquity. This expectation of a Deliverer descended from\r\nthe Prophet runs through the whole history of the Shí‘a. As we have\r\nseen, their supreme religious chiefs were the Imáms of ‘Alí's House,\r\neach of whom transmitted his authority to his successor. In the course\r\nof time disputes arose as to the succession. One sect acknowledged only\r\nseven legitimate Imáms, while another carried the number to twelve. The\r\nlast Imám of the 'Seveners' (_al-Sab‘iyya_), who are commonly called\r\nIsmá‘ílís, was Muḥammad b. Ismá‘íl, and of the 'Twelvers'\r\n(_al-Ithná-‘ashariyya_) Muḥammad b. al-Ḥasan.[405] Both those personages\r\nvanished mysteriously about 770 and 870 A.D., and their respective\r\nfollowers, refusing to believe that they were dead, asserted that their\r\nImám had withdrawn himself for a season from mortal sight, but that he\r\nwould surely return at last as the promised Mahdí. It would take a long\r\nwhile to enumerate all the pretenders and fanatics who have claimed this\r\ntitle.[406] Two of them founded the Fáṭimid and Almohade dynasties,\r\nwhich we shall mention elsewhere, but they generally died on the gibbet\r\nor the battle-field. The ideal which they, so to speak, incarnated did\r\nnot perish with them. Mahdiism, the faith in a divinely appointed\r\nrevolution which will sweep away the powers of evil and usher in a\r\nGolden Age of justice and truth such as the world has never known, is a\r\npresent and inspiring fact which deserves to be well weighed by those\r\nwho doubt the possibility of an Islamic Reformation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shí‘ite gatherings at Karbalá.]\r\n\r\nThe Shí‘a began as a political faction, but it could not remain so for\r\nany length of time, because in Islam politics always tend to take\r\nreligious ground, just as the successful religious reformer invariably\r\nbecomes a ruler. The Saba’ites furnished the Shí‘ite movement with a\r\ntheological basis; and the massacre of Ḥusayn, followed by Mukhtár's\r\nrebellion, supplied the indispensable element of enthusiasm. Within a\r\nfew years after the death of Ḥusayn his grave at Karbalá was already a\r\nplace of pilgrimage for the Shí‘ites. When the 'Penitents'\r\n(_al-Tawwábún_) revolted in 684 they repaired thither and lifted their\r\nvoices simultaneously in a loud wail, and wept, and prayed God that He\r\nwould forgive them for having deserted the Prophet's grandson in his\r\nhour of need. \"O God!\" exclaimed their chief, \"have mercy on Ḥusayn, the\r\nMartyr and the son of a Martyr, the Mahdí and the son of a Mahdí, the\r\nṢiddíq and the son of a Ṣiddíq![407] O God! we bear witness that we\r\nfollow their religion and their path, and that we are the foes of their\r\nslayers and the friends of those who love them.\"[408] Here is the germ\r\nof the _ta‘ziyas_, or Passion Plays, which are acted every year on the\r\n10th of Muḥarram, wherever Shí‘ites are to be found.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mukhtár.]\r\n\r\nBut the Moses of the Shí‘a, the man who showed them the way to victory\r\nalthough he did not lead them to it, is undoubtedly Mukhtár. He came\r\nforward in the name of ‘Alí's son, Muḥammad, generally known as Ibnu\r\n’l-Ḥanafiyya after his mother. Thus he gained the support of the Arabian\r\nShí‘ites, properly so called, who were devoted to ‘Alí and his House,\r\nand laid no stress upon the circumstance of descent from the Prophet,\r\nwhereas the Persian adherents of the Shí‘a made it a vital matter, and\r\nheld accordingly that only the sons of ‘Alí by his wife Fáṭima were\r\nfully qualified Imáms. Raising the cry of vengeance for Ḥusayn, Mukhtár\r\ncarried this party also along with him. In 686 he found himself master\r\nof Kúfa. Neither the result of his triumph nor the rapid overthrow of\r\nhis power concerns us here, but something must be said about the aims\r\nand character of the movement which he headed.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The _Mawálí_ of Kúfa.]\r\n\r\n  \"More than half the population of Kúfa was composed of _Mawálí_\r\n  (Clients), who monopolised handicraft, trade, and commerce. They\r\n  were mostly Persians in race and language; they had come to Kúfa as\r\n  prisoners of war and had there passed over to Islam: then they were\r\n  manumitted by their owners and received as clients into the Arab\r\n  tribes, so that they now occupied an ambiguous position\r\n  (_Zwitterstellung_), being no longer slaves, but still very\r\n  dependent on their patrons; needing their protection, bound to their\r\n  service, and forming their retinue in peace and war. In these\r\n  _Mawálí_, who were entitled by virtue of Islam to more than the\r\n  'dominant Arabism' allowed them, the hope now dawned of freeing\r\n  themselves from clientship and of rising to full and direct\r\n  participation in the Moslem state.\"[409]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mukhtár and the _Mawálí_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persian influence on the Shí‘a.]\r\n\r\nMukhtár, though himself an Arab of noble family, trusted the _Mawálí_\r\nand treated them as equals, a proceeding which was bitterly resented by\r\nthe privileged class. \"You have taken away our clients who are the booty\r\nwhich God bestowed upon us together with this country. We emancipated\r\nthem, hoping to receive the Divine recompense and reward, but you would\r\nnot rest until you made them sharers in our booty.\"[410] Mukhtár was\r\nonly giving the _Mawálí_ their due--they were Moslems and had the right,\r\nas such, to a share in the revenues. To the haughty Arabs, however, it\r\nappeared a monstrous thing that the despised foreigners should be placed\r\non the same level with themselves. Thus Mukhtár was thrown into the arms\r\nof the _Mawálí_, and the movement now became not so much anti-Umayyad as\r\nanti-Arabian. Here is the turning-point in the history of the Shí‘a. Its\r\nranks were swelled by thousands of Persians imbued with the extreme\r\ndoctrines of the Saba’ites which have been sketched above, and animated\r\nby the intense hatred of a downtrodden people towards their conquerors\r\nand oppressors. Consequently the Shí‘a assumed a religious and\r\nenthusiastic character, and struck out a new path which led it farther\r\nand farther from the orthodox creed. The doctrine of 'Interpretation'\r\n(_Ta’wíl_) opened the door to all sorts of extravagant ideas. One of the\r\nprincipal Shí‘ite sects, the Háshimiyya, held that \"there is an esoteric\r\nside to everything external, a spirit to every form, a hidden meaning\r\n(_ta’wíl_) to every revelation, and to every similitude in this world a\r\ncorresponding reality in the other world; that ‘Alí united in his own\r\nperson the knowledge of all mysteries and communicated it to his son\r\nMuḥammad Ibnu ’l-Ḥanafiyya, who passed it on to his son Abú Háshim; and\r\nthat the possessor of this universal knowledge is the true Imám.\"[411]\r\nSo, without ceasing to be Moslems in name, the Shí‘ites transmuted Islam\r\ninto whatever shape they pleased by virtue of a mystical interpretation\r\nbased on the infallible authority of the House of Muḥammad, and out of\r\nthe ruins of a political party there gradually arose a great religious\r\norganisation in which men of the most diverse opinions could work\r\ntogether for deliverance from the Umayyad yoke. The first step towards\r\nthis development was made by Mukhtár, a versatile genius who seems to\r\nhave combined the parts of political adventurer, social reformer,\r\nprophet, and charlatan. He was crushed and his Persian allies were\r\ndecimated, but the seed which he had sown bore an abundant harvest when,\r\nsixty years later, Abú Muslim unfurled the black standard of the\r\n‘Abbásids in Khurásán.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The oldest theological sects.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the origin of the oldest theological sects in Islam, the\r\nMurjites and the Mu‘tazilites, we possess too little contemporary\r\nevidence to make a positive statement. It is probable that the latter at\r\nany rate arose, as Von Kremer has suggested, under the influence of\r\nGreek theologians, especially John of Damascus and his pupil, Theodore\r\nAbucara (Abú Qurra), the Bishop of Ḥarrán.[412] Christians were freely\r\nadmitted to the Umayyad court. The Christian al-Akhṭal was\r\npoet-laureate, while many of his co-religionists held high offices in\r\nthe Government. Moslems and Christians exchanged ideas in friendly\r\ndiscussion or controversially. Armed with the hair-splitting weapons of\r\nByzantine theology, which they soon learned to use only too well, the\r\nArabs proceeded to try their edge on the dogmas of Islam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Murjites.]\r\n\r\nThe leading article of the Murjite creed was this, that no one who\r\nprofessed to believe in the One God could be declared an infidel,\r\nwhatever sins he might commit, until God Himself had given judgment\r\nagainst him.[413] The Murjites were so called because they deferred\r\n(_arja’a_ = to defer) their decision in such cases and left the sinner's\r\nfate in suspense, so long as it was doubtful.[414] This principle they\r\napplied in different ways. For example, they refused to condemn ‘Alí and\r\n‘Uthmán outright, as the Khárijites did. \"Both ‘Alí and ‘Uthmán,\" they\r\nsaid, \"were servants of God, and by God alone must they be judged; it is\r\nnot for us to pronounce either of them an infidel, notwithstanding that\r\nthey rent the Moslem people asunder.\"[415] On the other hand, the\r\nMurjites equally rejected the pretensions made by the Shí‘ites on behalf\r\nof ‘Alí and by the Umayyads on behalf of Mu‘áwiya. For the most part\r\nthey maintained a neutral attitude towards the Umayyad Government: they\r\nwere passive resisters, content, as Wellhausen puts it, \"to stand up for\r\nthe impersonal Law.\" Sometimes, however, they turned the principle of\r\ntoleration against their rulers. Thus Ḥárith b. Surayj and other Arabian\r\nMurjites joined the oppressed _Mawálí_ of Khurásán to whom the\r\nGovernment denied those rights which they had acquired by\r\nconversion.[416] According to the Murjite view, these Persians, having\r\nprofessed Islam, should no longer be treated as tax-paying infidels. The\r\nMurjites brought the same tolerant spirit into religion. They set faith\r\nabove works, emphasised the love and goodness of God, and held that no\r\nMoslem would be damned everlastingly. Some, like Jahm b. Ṣafwán, went so\r\nfar as to declare that faith (_ímán_) was merely an inward conviction: a\r\nman might openly profess Christianity or Judaism or any form of unbelief\r\nwithout ceasing to be a good Moslem, provided only that he acknowledged\r\nAllah with his heart.[417] The moderate school found their most\r\nillustrious representative in Abú Ḥanífa († 767 A.D.), and through this\r\ngreat divine--whose followers to-day are counted by millions--their\r\nliberal doctrines were diffused and perpetuated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mu‘tazilites.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Umayyad period Baṣra was the intellectual capital of Islam,\r\nand in that city we find the first traces of a sect which maintained the\r\nprinciple that thought must be free in the search for truth. The origin\r\nof the Mu‘tazilites (_al-Mu‘tazila_), as they are generally called,\r\ntakes us back to the famous divine and ascetic, Ḥasan of Baṣra (†728\r\nA.D.). One day he was asked to give his opinion on a point regarding\r\nwhich the Murjites and the Khárijites held opposite views, namely,\r\nwhether those who had committed a great sin should be deemed believers\r\nor unbelievers. While Ḥasan was considering the question, one of his\r\npupils, Wáṣil b. ‘Aṭá (according to another tradition, ‘Amr b. ‘Ubayd)\r\nreplied that such persons were neither believers nor unbelievers, but\r\nshould be ranked in an intermediate state. He then turned aside and\r\nbegan to explain the grounds of his assertion to a group which gathered\r\nabout him in a different part of the mosque. Ḥasan said: \"Wáṣil has\r\nseparated himself from us\" (_i‘tazala ‘anná_); and on this account the\r\nfollowers of Wáṣil were named 'Mu‘tazilites,' _i.e._, Schismatics.\r\nAlthough the story may not be literally true, it is probably safe to\r\nassume that the new sect originated in Baṣra among the pupils of\r\nḤasan,[418] who was the life and soul of the religious movement of the\r\nfirst century A.H. The Mu‘tazilite heresy, in its earliest form, is\r\nconnected with the doctrine of Predestination. On this subject the Koran\r\nspeaks with two voices. Muḥammad was anything but a logically exact and\r\nconsistent thinker. He was guided by the impulse of the moment, and\r\nneither he nor his hearers perceived, as later Moslems did, that the\r\nlanguage of the Koran is often contradictory. Thus in the present\r\ninstance texts which imply the moral responsibility of man for his\r\nactions--_e.g._, \"_Every soul is in pledge_ (with God) _for what it hath\r\nwrought_\"[419]; \"_Whoso does good benefits himself, and whoso does evil\r\ndoes it against himself_\"[420]--stand side by side with others which\r\ndeclare that God leads men aright or astray, as He pleases; that the\r\nhearts of the wicked are sealed and their ears made deaf to the truth;\r\nand that they are certainly doomed to perdition. This fatalistic view\r\nprevailed in the first century of Islam, and the dogma of Predestination\r\nwas almost universally accepted. Ibn Qutayba, however, mentions the\r\nnames of twenty-seven persons who held the opinion that men's actions\r\nare free.[421] Two among them, Ma‘bad al-Juhaní and Abú Marwán Ghaylán,\r\nwho were put to death by ‘Abdu ’l-Malik and his son Hishám, do not\r\nappear to have been condemned as heretics, but rather as enemies of the\r\nUmayyad Government.[422] The real founder of the Mu‘tazilites was Wáṣil\r\nb. ‘Aṭá († 748 A.D.),[423] who added a second cardinal doctrine to that\r\nof free-will. He denied the existence of the Divine attributes--Power,\r\nWisdom, Life, &c.--on the ground that such qualities, if conceived as\r\neternal, would destroy the Unity of God. Hence the Mu‘tazilites called\r\nthemselves 'the partisans of Unity and Justice' (_Ahlu’l-tawḥíd\r\nwa-’l-‘adl_): of Unity for the reason which has been explained, and of\r\nJustice, because they held that God was not the author of evil and that\r\nHe would not punish His creatures except for actions within their\r\ncontrol. The further development of these Rationalistic ideas belongs to\r\nthe ‘Abbásid period and will be discussed in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of asceticism.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥasan of Baṣra.]\r\n\r\nThe founder of Islam had too much human nature and common sense to\r\ndemand of his countrymen such mortifying austerities as were practised\r\nby the Jewish Essenes and the Christian monks. His religion was not\r\nwithout ascetic features, _e.g._, the Fast of Ramaḍán, the prohibition\r\nof wine, and the ordinance of the pilgrimage, but these can scarcely be\r\ncalled unreasonable. On the other hand Muḥammad condemned celibacy not\r\nonly by his personal example but also by precept. \"There is no monkery\r\nin Islam,\" he is reported to have said, and there was in fact nothing of\r\nthe kind for more than a century after his death. During this time,\r\nhowever, asceticism made great strides. It was the inevitable outcome of\r\nthe Muḥammadan conception of Allah, in which the attributes of mercy and\r\nlove are overshadowed by those of majesty, awe, and vengeance. The\r\nterrors of Judgment Day so powerfully described in the Koran were\r\nrealised with an intensity of conviction which it is difficult for us to\r\nimagine. As Goldziher has observed, an exaggerated consciousness of sin\r\nand the dread of Divine punishment gave the first impulse to Moslem\r\nasceticism. Thus we read that Tamím al-Dárí, one of the Prophet's\r\nCompanions, who was formerly a Christian, passed the whole night until\r\ndaybreak, repeating a single verse of the Koran (xlv, 20)--\"_Do those\r\nwho work evil think that We shall make them even as those who believe\r\nand do good, so that their life and death shall be equal? Ill do they\r\njudge!_\"[424] Abu ’l-Dardá, another of the Companions, used to say: \"If\r\nye knew what ye shall see after death, ye would not eat food nor drink\r\nwater from appetite, and I wish that I were a tree which is lopped and\r\nthen devoured.\"[425] There were many who shared these views, and their\r\ndetermination to renounce the world and to live solely for God was\r\nstrengthened by their disgust with a tyrannical and impious Government,\r\nand by the almost uninterrupted spectacle of bloodshed, rapine, and\r\ncivil war. Ḥasan of Baṣra († 728)--we have already met him in connection\r\nwith the Mu‘tazilites--is an outstanding figure in this early ascetic\r\nmovement, which proceeded on orthodox lines.[426] Fear of God seized on\r\nhim so mightily that, in the words of his biographer, \"it seemed as\r\nthough Hell-fire had been created for him alone.\"[427] All who looked on\r\nhis face thought that he must have been recently overtaken by some great\r\ncalamity.[428] One day a friend saw him weeping and asked him the cause.\r\n\"I weep,\" he replied, \"for fear that I have done something unwittingly\r\nand unintentionally, or committed some fault, or spoken some word which\r\nis unpleasing to God: then He may have said, 'Begone, for now thou hast\r\nno more honour in My court, and henceforth I will not receive anything\r\nfrom thee.'\"[429] Al-Mubarrad relates that two monks, coming from Syria,\r\nentered Baṣra and looked at Ḥasan, whereupon one said to the other, \"Let\r\nus turn aside to visit this man, whose way of life appears like that of\r\nthe Messiah.\" So they went, and they found him supporting his chin on\r\nthe palm of his hand, while he was saying--\"How I marvel at those who\r\nhave been ordered to lay in a stock of provisions and have been summoned\r\nto set out on a journey, and yet the foremost of them stays for the\r\nhindermost! Would that I knew what they are waiting for!\"[430] The\r\nfollowing utterances are characteristic:--\r\n\r\n  \"God hath made fasting a hippodrome (place or time of training) for\r\n  His servants, that they may race towards obedience to Him.[431] Some\r\n  come in first and win the prize, while others are left behind and\r\n  return disappointed; and by my life, if the lid were removed, the\r\n  well-doer would be diverted by his well-doing, and the evildoer by\r\n  his evil-doing, from wearing new garments or from anointing his\r\n  hair.\"[432]\r\n\r\n  \"You meet one of them with white skin and delicate complexion,\r\n  speeding along the path of vanity: he shaketh his hips and clappeth\r\n  his sides and saith, 'Here am I, recognise me!' Yes, we recognise\r\n  thee, and thou art hateful to God and hateful to good men.\"[433]\r\n\r\n  \"The bounties of God are too numerous to be acknowledged unless with\r\n  His help, and the sins of Man are too numerous for him to escape\r\n  therefrom unless God pardon them.\"[434]\r\n\r\n  \"The wonder is not how the lost were lost, but how the saved were\r\n  saved.\"[435]\r\n\r\n  \"Cleanse ye these hearts (by meditation and remembrance of God), for\r\n  they are quick to rust; and restrain ye these souls, for they desire\r\n  eagerly, and if ye restrain them not, they will drag you to an evil\r\n  end.\"[436]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥasan of Baṣra not a genuine Ṣúfí.]\r\n\r\nThe Ṣúfís, concerning whom we shall say a few words presently, claim\r\nḤasan as one of themselves, and with justice in so far as he attached\r\nimportance to spiritual righteousness, and was not satisfied with merely\r\nexternal acts of devotion. \"A grain of genuine piety,\" he declared, \"is\r\nbetter than a thousandfold weight of fasting and prayer.\"[437] But\r\nalthough some of his sayings which are recorded in the later biographies\r\nlend colour to the fiction that he was a full-blown Ṣúfí, there can be\r\nno doubt that his mysticism--if it deserves that name--was of the most\r\nmoderate type, entirely lacking the glow and exaltation which we find in\r\nthe saintly woman, Rábi‘a al-‘Adawiyya, with whom legend associates\r\nhim.[438]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The derivation of 'Ṣúfí.']\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The beginnings of Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name 'Ṣúfí' is explained by the Ṣúfís themselves in\r\nmany different ways, but of the derivations which have been proposed\r\nonly three possess any claim to consideration, viz., those which connect\r\nit with σοφός (wise) or with _ṣafá_ (purity) or with _ṣúf_ (wool).[439]\r\nThe first two are inadmissible on linguistic grounds, into which\r\nwe need not enter, though it may be remarked that the derivation\r\nfrom _ṣafá_ is consecrated by the authority of the Ṣúfí Saints, and is\r\ngenerally accepted in the East.[440] The reason for this preference\r\nappears in such definitions as \"The Ṣúfí is he who keeps his heart pure\r\n(_ṣáfí_) with God,\"[441] \"Ṣúfiism is 'the being chosen for purity'\r\n(_iṣṭifá_): whoever is thus chosen and made pure from all except God is\r\nthe true Ṣúfí.\"[442] Understood in this sense, the word had a lofty\r\nsignificance which commended it to the elect. Nevertheless it can be\r\ntracked to a quite humble source. Woollen garments were frequently worn\r\nby men of ascetic life in the early times of Islam in order (as Ibn\r\nKhaldún says) that they might distinguish themselves from those who\r\naffected a more luxurious fashion of dress. Hence the name 'Ṣúfí,' which\r\ndenotes in the first instance an ascetic clad in wool (_ṣúf_), just as\r\nthe Capuchins owed their designation to the hood (_cappuccio_) which\r\nthey wore. According to Qushayrí, the term came into common use before\r\nthe end of the second century of the Hijra (= 815 A.D.). By this time,\r\nhowever, the ascetic movement in Islam had to some extent assumed a new\r\ncharacter, and the meaning of 'Ṣúfí,' if the word already existed, must\r\nhave undergone a corresponding change. It seems to me not unlikely that\r\nthe epithet in question marks the point of departure from orthodox\r\nasceticism and that, as Jámí states, it was first applied to Abú Háshim\r\nof Kúfa (_ob._ before 800 _A.D._), who founded a monastery (_khánaqáh_)\r\nfor Ṣúfís at Ramla in Palestine. Be that as it may, the distinction\r\nbetween asceticism (_zuhd_) and Ṣúfiism--a distinction which answers,\r\nbroadly speaking, to the _via purgativa_ and the _via illuminativa_ of\r\nWestern mediæval mysticism--begins to show itself before the close of\r\nthe Umayyad period, and rapidly develops in the early ‘Abbásid age under\r\nthe influence of foreign ideas and, in particular, of Greek philosophy.\r\nLeaving this later development to be discussed in a subsequent chapter,\r\nwe shall now briefly consider the origin of Ṣúfiism properly so called\r\nand the first manifestation of the peculiar tendencies on which it is\r\nbased.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards its origin, we cannot do better than quote the observations\r\nwith which Ibn Khaldún († 1406 A.D.) introduces the chapter on Ṣúfiism\r\nin the Prolegomena to his great historical work:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ibn Khaldún's account of the origin of Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\n  \"This is one of the religious sciences which were born in Islam. The\r\n  way of the Ṣúfís was regarded by the ancient Moslems and their\r\n  illustrious men--the Companions of the Prophet (_al-Ṣaḥába_),\r\n  the Successors (_al-Tábi‘ún_), and the generation which came after\r\n  them--as the way of Truth and Salvation. To be assiduous in piety,\r\n  to give up all else for God's sake, to turn away from worldly gauds\r\n  and vanities, to renounce pleasure, wealth, and power, which are the\r\n  general objects of human ambition, to abandon society and to lead in\r\n  seclusion a life devoted solely to the service of God--these were\r\n  the fundamental principles of Ṣúfiism which prevailed among the\r\n  Companions and the Moslems of old time. When, however, in the second\r\n  generation and afterwards worldly tastes became widely spread, and\r\n  men no longer shrank from such contamination, those who made piety\r\n  their aim were distinguished by the title of _Ṣúfís_ or\r\n  _Mutaṣawwifa_ (aspirants to Ṣúfiism).[443]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The earliest form of Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\nFrom this it is clear that Ṣúfiism, if not originally identical with\r\nthe ascetic revolt of which, as we have seen, Ḥasan of Baṣra was\r\nthe most conspicuous representative, at any rate arose out of that\r\nmovement. It was not a speculative system, like the Mu‘tazilite heresy,\r\nbut a practical religion and rule of life. \"We derived Ṣúfiism,\" said\r\nJunayd, \"from fasting and taking leave of the world and breaking\r\nfamiliar ties and renouncing what men deem good; not from disputation\"\r\n(_qíl wa-qál_).[444] The oldest Ṣúfís were ascetics and hermits, but\r\nthey were also something more. They brought out the spiritual and\r\nmystical element in Islam, or brought it in, if they did not find it\r\nthere already.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The difference between asceticism and Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\n\"Ṣúfiism,\" says Suhrawardí,[445] \"is neither 'poverty' (_faqr_) nor\r\nasceticism (_zuhd_), but a term which comprehends the ideas of both,\r\ntogether with something besides. Without these superadded qualities a\r\nman is not a Ṣúfí, though he may be an ascetic (_záhid_) or a fakír\r\n(_faqír_). It is said that, notwithstanding the excellence of 'poverty,'\r\nthe end thereof is only the beginning of Ṣúfiism.\" A little further\r\non he explains the difference thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"The fakír holds fast to his 'poverty' and is profoundly convinced\r\n  of its superior merit. He prefers it to riches because he longs for\r\n  the Divine recompense of which his faith assures him ... and whenever\r\n  he contemplates the everlasting reward, he abstains from the\r\n  fleeting joys of this world and embraces poverty and indigence and\r\n  fears that if he should cease to be 'poor' he will lose both the\r\n  merit and the prize. Now this is absolutely unsound according to the\r\n  doctrine of the Ṣúfís, because he hopes for recompense and\r\n  renounces the world on that account, whereas the Ṣúfí does not\r\n  renounce it for the sake of promised rewards but, on the contrary,\r\n  for the sake of present 'states,' for he is the 'son of his\r\n  time.'...[446] The theory that 'poverty' is the foundation of\r\n  Ṣúfiism signifies that the diverse stages of Ṣúfiism are\r\n  reached by the road of 'poverty'; it does not imply that the Ṣúfí\r\n  is essentially a fakír.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The early Ṣúfís.]\r\n\r\nThe keynote of Ṣúfiism is disinterested, selfless devotion, in a\r\nword, Love. Though not wholly strange, this idea was very far from being\r\nfamiliar to pious Muḥammadans, who were more deeply impressed by the\r\npower and vengeance of God than by His goodness and mercy. The Koran\r\ngenerally represents Allah as a stern, unapproachable despot, requiring\r\nutter submission to His arbitrary will, but infinitely unconcerned with\r\nhuman feelings and aspirations. Such a Being could not satisfy the\r\nreligious instinct, and the whole history of Ṣúfiism is a protest\r\nagainst the unnatural divorce between God and Man which this conception\r\ninvolves. Accordingly, I do not think that we need look beyond Islam for\r\nthe origin of the Ṣúfí doctrines, although it would be a mistake not\r\nto recognise the part which Christian influence must have had in shaping\r\ntheir early development. The speculative character with which they\r\ngradually became imbued, and which in the course of time completely\r\ntransformed them, was more or less latent during the Umayyad period and\r\nfor nearly a century after the accession of the House of ‘Abbás. The\r\nearly Ṣúfís are still on orthodox ground: their relation to Islam is\r\nnot unlike that of the mediæval Spanish mystics to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. They attach extraordinary value to certain points in\r\nMuḥammad's teaching and emphasise them so as to leave the others\r\nalmost a dead letter. They do not indulge in profound dialectic, but\r\nconfine themselves to matters bearing on practical theology.\r\nSelf-abandonment, rigorous self-mortification, fervid piety, and\r\nquietism carried to the verge of apathy form the main features of their\r\ncreed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibráhím b. Adham.]\r\n\r\nA full and vivid picture of early Ṣúfiism might be drawn from the\r\nnumerous biographies in Arabic and Persian, which supply abundant\r\ndetails concerning the manner of life of these Muḥammadan Saints, and\r\nfaithfully record their austerities, visions, miracles, and sayings.\r\nHere we have only space to add a few lines about the most important\r\nmembers of the group--Ibráhím b. Adham, Abú ‘Alí Shaqíq, Fuḍayl b.\r\n‘Iyáḍ, and Rábi‘a--all of whom died between the middle and end of the\r\nsecond century after the Hijra (767-815 A.D.). Ibráhím belonged to the\r\nroyal family of Balkh. Forty scimitars of gold and forty maces of gold\r\nwere borne in front of him and behind. One day, while hunting, he heard\r\na voice which cried, \"Awake! wert thou created for this?\" He exchanged\r\nhis splendid robes for the humble garb and felt cap of a shepherd, bade\r\nfarewell to his kingdom, and lived for nine years in a cave near\r\nNaysábúr.[447] His customary prayer was, \"O God, uplift me from the\r\nshame of disobedience to the glory of submission unto Thee!\"\r\n\r\n  \"O God!\" he said, \"Thou knowest that the Eight Paradises are little\r\n  beside the honour which Thou hast done unto me, and beside Thy love,\r\n  and beside Thy giving me intimacy with the praise of Thy name, and\r\n  beside the peace of mind which Thou hast given me when I meditate on\r\n  Thy majesty.\" And again: \"You will not attain to righteousness until\r\n  you traverse six passes (_‘aqabát_): the first is that you shut the\r\n  door of pleasure and open the door of hardship; the second, that you\r\n  shut the door of eminence and open the door of abasement; the third,\r\n  that you shut the door of ease and open the door of affliction; the\r\n  fourth, that you shut the door of sleep and open the door of\r\n  wakefulness; the fifth, that you shut the door of riches and open\r\n  the door of poverty; and the sixth, that you shut the door of\r\n  expectation and open the door of making yourself ready for death.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shaqíq of Balkh.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fuḍayl b. ‘Iyáḍ.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rábi‘a al-‘Adawiyya.]\r\n\r\nShaqíq, also of Balkh, laid particular stress on the duty of leaving\r\none's self entirely in God's hands (_tawakkul_), a term which is\r\npractically synonymous with passivity; _e.g._, the _mutawakkil_ must\r\nmake no effort to obtain even the barest livelihood, he must not ask for\r\nanything, nor engage in any trade: his business is with God alone. One\r\nof Shaqíq's sayings was, \"Nine-tenths of devotion consist in flight from\r\nmankind, the remaining tenth in silence.\" Similarly, Fuḍayl b.\r\n‘Iyáḍ, a converted captain of banditti, declared that \"to abstain for\r\nmen's sake from doing anything is hypocrisy, while to do anything for\r\nmen's sake is idolatry.\" It may be noticed as an argument against the\r\nIndian origin of Ṣúfiism that although the three Ṣúfís who have\r\nbeen mentioned were natives of Khurásán or Transoxania, and therefore\r\npresumably in touch with Buddhistic ideas, no trace can be found in\r\ntheir sayings of the doctrine of dying to self (_faná_), which plays a\r\ngreat part in subsequent Ṣúfiism, and which Von Kremer and others\r\nhave identified with _Nirvána_. We now come to a more interesting\r\npersonality, in whom the ascetic and quietistic type of Ṣúfiism is\r\ntransfigured by emotion and begins clearly to reveal the direction of\r\nits next advance. Every one knows that women have borne a distinguished\r\npart in the annals of European mysticism: St. Teresa, Madame Guyon,\r\nCatharine of Siena, and Juliana of Norwich, to mention but a few names\r\nat random. And notwithstanding the intellectual death to which the\r\nmajority of Moslem women are condemned by their Prophet's ordinance, the\r\nṢúfís, like the Roman Catholics, can boast a goodly number of female\r\nsaints. The oldest of these, and by far the most renowned, is Rábi‘a,\r\nwho belonged to the tribe of ‘Adí, whence she is generally called Rábi‘a\r\nal-‘Adawiyya. She was a native of Baṣra and died at Jerusalem,\r\nprobably towards the end of the second century of Islam: her tomb was an\r\nobject of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages, as we learn from Ibn Khallikán\r\n(† 1282 A.D.). Although the sayings and verses attributed to her by\r\nṢúfí writers may be of doubtful authenticity, there is every reason\r\nto suppose that they fairly represent the actual character of her\r\ndevotion, which resembled that of all feminine mystics in being inspired\r\nby tender and ardent feeling. She was asked: \"Do you love God Almighty?\"\r\n\"Yes.\" \"Do you hate the Devil?\" \"My love of God,\" she replied, \"leaves\r\nme no leisure to hate the Devil. I saw the Prophet in a dream. He said,\r\n'O Rábi‘a, do you love me?' I said, 'O Apostle of God, who does not love\r\nthee?--but love of God hath so absorbed me that neither love nor hate of\r\nany other thing remains in my heart.'\" Rábi‘a is said to have spoken the\r\nfollowing verses:--\r\n\r\n \"Two ways I love Thee: selfishly,\r\n  And next, as worthy is of Thee.\r\n 'Tis selfish love that I do naught\r\n  Save think on Thee with every thought;\r\n 'Tis purest love when Thou dost raise\r\n  The veil to my adoring gaze.\r\n  Not mine the praise in that or this,\r\n  Thine is the praise in both, I wis.\"[448]\r\n\r\nWhether genuine or not, these lines, with their mixture of devotion and\r\nspeculation--the author distinguishes the illuminative from the\r\ncontemplative life and manifestly regards the latter as the more\r\nexcellent way--serve to mark the end of the ascetic school of Ṣúfiism\r\nand the rise of a new theosophy which, under the same name and still\r\nprofessing to be in full accord with the Koran and the _Sunna_, was\r\nfounded to some extent upon ideas of extraneous origin--ideas\r\nirreconcilable with any revealed religion, and directly opposed to the\r\nsevere and majestic simplicity of the Muḥammadan articles of faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Umayyad literature.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decline of Arabian poetry not due to Muḥammad.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Umayyad poets.]\r\n\r\nThe opening century of Islam was not favourable to literature. At first\r\nconquest, expansion, and organisation, then civil strife absorbed the\r\nnation's energies; then, under the Umayyads, the old pagan spirit\r\nasserted itself once more. Consequently the literature of this period\r\nconsists almost exclusively of poetry, which bears few marks of Islamic\r\ninfluence. I need scarcely refer to the view which long prevailed in\r\nEurope that Muḥammad corrupted the taste of his countrymen by setting\r\nup the Koran as an incomparable model of poetic style, and by condemning\r\nthe admired productions of the heathen bards and the art of poetry\r\nitself; nor remind my readers that in the first place the Koran is not\r\npoetical in form (so that it could not serve as a model of this kind),\r\nand secondly, according to Muḥammadan belief, is the actual Word of\r\nGod, therefore _sui generis_ and beyond imitation. Again, the poets whom\r\nthe Prophet condemned were his most dangerous opponents: he hated them\r\nnot as poets but as propagators and defenders of false ideals, and\r\nbecause they ridiculed his teaching, while on the contrary he honoured\r\nand rewarded those who employed their talents in the right way. If the\r\nnomad minstrels and cavaliers who lived, as they sang, the free life of\r\nthe desert were never equalled by the brilliant laureates of imperial\r\nDamascus and Baghdád, the causes of the decline cannot be traced to\r\nMuḥammad's personal attitude, but are due to various circumstances\r\nfor which he is only responsible in so far as he founded a religious and\r\npolitical system that revolutionised Arabian society. The poets of the\r\nperiod with which we are now dealing follow slavishly in the footsteps\r\nof the ancients, as though Islam had never been. Instead of celebrating\r\nthe splendid victories and heroic deeds of Moslem warriors, the bard\r\nliving in a great city still weeps over the relics of his beloved's\r\nencampment in the wilderness, still rides away through the sandy waste\r\non the peerless camel, whose fine points he particularly describes; and\r\nif he should happen to be addressing the Caliph, it is ten to one that\r\nhe will credit that august personage with all the virtues of a Bedouin\r\nShaykh. \"Fortunately the imitation of the antique _qaṣída_, at any\r\nrate with the greatest Umayyad poets, is to some extent only accessory\r\nto another form of art that excites our historical interest in a high\r\ndegree: namely, the occasional poems (very numerous in almost all these\r\nwriters), which are suggested by the mood of the moment and can shed a\r\nvivid light on contemporary history.\"[449]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Music and song in the Holy Cities.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Umar b. Abí Rabí‘a.]\r\n\r\nThe conquests made by the successors of the Prophet brought enormous\r\nwealth into Mecca and Medína, and when the Umayyad aristocracy gained\r\nthe upper hand in ‘Uthmán's Caliphate, these towns developed a\r\nvoluptuous and dissolute life which broke through every restriction that\r\nIslam had imposed. The increase of luxury produced a corresponding\r\nrefinement of the poetic art. Although music was not unknown to the\r\npagan Arabs, it had hitherto been cultivated chiefly by foreigners,\r\nespecially Greek and Persian singing-girls. But in the first century\r\nafter the Hijra we hear of several Arab singers,[450] natives of Mecca\r\nand Medína, who set favourite passages to music: henceforth the words\r\nand the melody are inseparably united, as we learn from the _Kitábu\r\n’l-Aghání_ or 'Book of Songs,' where hundreds of examples are to be\r\nfound. Amidst the gay throng of pleasure-seekers women naturally played\r\na prominent part, and love, which had hitherto formed in most cases\r\nmerely the conventional prelude to an ode, now began to be sung for its\r\nown sake. In this Peninsular school, as it may be named in contrast with\r\nthe bold and masculine strain of the great Provincial poets whom we are\r\nabout to mention, the palm unquestionably belongs to ‘Umar b. Abí Rabí‘a\r\n(† 719 A.D.), the son of a rich Meccan merchant. He passed the best part\r\nof his life in the pursuit of noble dames, who alone inspired him to\r\nsing. His poetry was so seductive that it was regarded by devout Moslems\r\nas \"the greatest crime ever committed against God,\" and so charming\r\nwithal that ‘Abdulláh b. ‘Abbás, the Prophet's cousin and a famous\r\nauthority on the Koran and the Traditions, could not refrain from\r\ngetting by heart some erotic verses which ‘Umar recited to him.[451] The\r\nArabs said, with truth, that the tribe of Quraysh had won distinction in\r\nevery field save poetry, but we must allow that ‘Umar b. Abí Rabí‘a is a\r\nclear exception to this rule. His diction, like that of Catullus, has\r\nall the unaffected ease of refined conversation. Here are a few lines:--\r\n\r\n \"Blame me no more, O comrades! but to-day\r\n  Quietly with me beside the howdahs stay.\r\n  Blame not my love for Zaynab, for to her\r\n  And hers my heart is pledged a prisoner.\r\n  Ah, can I ever think of how we met\r\n  Once at al-Khayf, and feel no fond regret?\r\n  My song of other women was but jest:\r\n  She reigns alone, eclipsing all the rest.\r\n  Hers is my love sincere, 'tis she the flame\r\n  Of passion kindles--so, a truce to blame!\"[452]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Love-ballads.]\r\n\r\nWe have no space to dwell on the minor poets of the same school,\r\nal-‘Arjí (a kinsman of the Umayyads), al-Aḥwaṣ, and many others.\r\nIt has been pointed out by Dr. C. Brockelmann that the love-poetry of\r\nthis epoch is largely of popular origin; _e.g._, the songs attributed to\r\nJamíl, in which Buthayna is addressed, and to Majnún--the hero of\r\ncountless Persian and Turkish romances which celebrate his love for\r\nLaylá--are true folk-songs such as occur in the _Arabian Nights_, and\r\nmay be heard in the streets of Beyrout or on the banks of the Tigris at\r\nthe present day. Many of them are extremely beautiful. I take the\r\nfollowing verses from a poem which is said to have been composed by\r\nJamíl:--\r\n\r\n \"Oh, might it flower anew, that youthful prime,\r\n  And restore to us, Buthayna, the bygone time!\r\n  And might we again be blest as we wont to be,\r\n  When thy folk were nigh and grudged what thou gavest me!\r\n\r\n  Shall I ever meet Buthayna alone again,\r\n  Each of us full of love as a cloud of rain?\r\n  Fast in her net was I when a lad, and till\r\n  This day my love is growing and waxing still.\r\n\r\n  I have spent my lifetime, waiting for her to speak,\r\n  And the bloom of youth is faded from off my cheek;\r\n  But I will not suffer that she my suit deny,\r\n  My love remains undying, though all things die!\"[453]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poetry in the provinces.]\r\n\r\nThe names of al-Akhṭal, al-Farazdaq, and Jarír stand out\r\npre-eminently in the list of Umayyad poets. They were men of a very\r\ndifferent stamp from the languishing Minnesingers and carpet-knights\r\nwho, like Jamíl, refused to battle except on the field of love. It is\r\nnoteworthy that all three were born and bred in Mesopotamia. The\r\nmotherland was exhausted; her ambitious and enterprising youth poured\r\ninto the provinces, which now become the main centres of intellectual\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Naqá’iḍ_ of Jarír and Farazdaq.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General interest in poetry.]\r\n\r\nFarazdaq and Jarír are intimately connected by a peculiar\r\nrivalry--\"_Arcades ambo_--_id est_, blackguards both.\" For many years\r\nthey engaged in a public scolding-match (_muháját_), and as neither had\r\nany scruples on the score of decency, the foulest abuse was bandied to\r\nand fro between them--abuse, however, which is redeemed from vulgarity\r\nby its literary excellence, and by the marvellous skill which the\r\nsatirists display in manipulating all the vituperative resources of the\r\nArabic language. Soon these 'Flytings' (_Naqá’iḍ_) were recited\r\neverywhere, and each poet had thousands of enthusiastic partisans who\r\nmaintained that he was superior to his rival.[454] One day Muhallab b.\r\nAbí Sufra, the governor of Khurásán, who was marching against the\r\nAzáriqa, a sect of the Khárijites, heard a great clamour and tumult in\r\nthe camp. On inquiring its cause, he found that the soldiers had been\r\nfiercely disputing as to the comparative merits of Jarír and Farazdaq,\r\nand desired to submit the question to his decision. \"Would you expose\r\nme,\" said Muhallab, \"to be torn in pieces by these two dogs? I will not\r\ndecide between them, but I will point out to you those who care not a\r\nwhit for either of them. Go to the Azáriqa! They are Arabs who\r\nunderstand poetry and judge it aright.\" Next day, when the armies faced\r\neach other, an Azraqite named ‘Abída b. Hilál stepped forth from the\r\nranks and offered single combat. One of Muhallab's men accepted the\r\nchallenge, but before fighting he begged his adversary to inform him\r\nwhich was the better poet--Farazdaq or Jarír? \"God confound you!\" cried\r\n‘Abída, \"do you ask me about poetry instead of studying the Koran and\r\nthe Sacred Law?\" Then he quoted a verse by Jarír and gave judgment in\r\nhis favour.[455] This incident affords a striking proof that the taste\r\nfor poetry, far from being confined to literary circles, was diffused\r\nthroughout the whole nation, and was cultivated even amidst the fatigues\r\nand dangers of war. Parallel instances occur in the history of the\r\nAthenians, the most gifted people of the West, and possibly elsewhere,\r\nbut imagine British soldiers discussing questions of that kind over the\r\ncamp-fires!\r\n\r\nAkhṭal joined in the fray. His sympathies were with Farazdaq, and the\r\n_naqá’iḍ_ which he and Jarír composed against each other have come\r\ndown to us. All these poets, like their Post-islamic brethren generally,\r\nwere professional encomiasts, greedy, venal, and ready to revile any one\r\nwho would not purchase their praise. Some further account of them may be\r\ninteresting to the reader, especially as the anecdotes related by their\r\nbiographers throw many curious sidelights on the manners of the time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Akhṭal.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the trio, Akhṭal (Ghiyáth b. Ghawth) of Taghlib, was a\r\nChristian, like most of his tribe--they had long been settled in\r\nMesopotamia--and remained in that faith to the end of his life, though\r\nthe Caliph ‘Abdu ’l-Malik is said to have offered him a pension and\r\n10,000 dirhems in cash if he would turn Moslem. His religion, however,\r\nwas less a matter of principle than of convenience, and to him the\r\nsupreme virtue of Christianity lay in the licence which it gave him to\r\ndrink wine as often as he pleased. The stories told of him suggest\r\ngrovelling devoutness combined with very easy morals, a phenomenon\r\nfamiliar to the student of mediæval Catholicism. It is related by one\r\nwho was touring in Syria that he found Akhṭal confined in a church at\r\nDamascus, and pleaded his cause with the priest. The latter stopped\r\nbeside Akhṭal and raising the staff on which he leaned--for he was an\r\naged man--exclaimed: \"O enemy of God, will you again defame people and\r\nsatirise them and caluminate chaste women?\" while the poet humbled\r\nhimself and promised never to repeat the offence. When asked how it was\r\nthat he, who was honoured by the Caliph and feared by all, behaved so\r\nsubmissively to this priest, he answered, \"It is religion, it is\r\nreligion.\"[456] On another occasion, seeing the Bishop pass, he cried to\r\nhis wife who was then pregnant, \"Run after him and touch his robe.\" The\r\npoor woman only succeeded in touching the tail of the Bishop's ass, but\r\nAkhṭal consoled her with the remark, \"He and the tail of his ass,\r\nthere's no difference!\"[457] It is characteristic of the anti-Islamic\r\nspirit which appears so strongly in the Umayyads that their chosen\r\nlaureate and champion should have been a Christian who was in truth a\r\nlineal descendant of the pagan bards. Pious Moslems might well be\r\nscandalised when he burst unannounced into the Caliph's presence,\r\nsumptuously attired in silk and wearing a cross of gold which was\r\nsuspended from his neck by a golden chain, while drops of wine trickled\r\nfrom his beard,[458] but their protests went unheeded at the court of\r\nDamascus, where nobody cared whether the author of a fine verse was a\r\nMoslem or a Christian, and where a poet was doubly welcome whose\r\nreligion enabled him to serve his masters without any regard to\r\nMuḥammadan sentiment; so that, for example, when Yazíd I wished to\r\ntake revenge on the people of Medína because one of their poets had\r\naddressed amatory verses to his sister, he turned to Akhṭal, who\r\nbranded the _Anṣár_, the men who had brought about the triumph of\r\nIslam, in the famous lines--\r\n\r\n \"Quraysh have borne away all the honour and glory,\r\n  And baseness alone is beneath the turbans of the Anṣár.\"[459]\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the poets were leaders of public opinion; their\r\nutterances took the place of political pamphlets or of party oratory for\r\nor against the Government of the day. On hearing Akhṭal's ode in\r\npraise of the Umayyad dynasty,[460] ‘Abdu ’l-Malik ordered one of his\r\nclients to conduct the author through the streets of Damascus and to cry\r\nout, \"Here is the poet of the Commander of the Faithful! Here is the\r\nbest poet of the Arabs!\"[461] No wonder that he was a favourite at court\r\nand such an eminent personage that the great tribe of Bakr used to\r\ninvite him to act as arbitrator whenever any controversy arose among\r\nthem.[462] Despite the luxury in which he lived, his wild Bedouin nature\r\npined for freedom, and he frequently left the capital to visit his home\r\nin the desert, where he not only married and divorced several wives, but\r\nalso threw himself with ardour into the feuds of his clan. We have\r\nalready noticed the part which he played in the literary duel between\r\nJarír and Farazdaq. From his deathbed he sent a final injunction to\r\nFarazdaq not to spare their common enemy.\r\n\r\nAkhṭal is commended by Arabian critics for the number and excellence\r\nof his long poems, as well as for the purity, polish, and correctness of\r\nhis style. Abú ‘Ubayda put him first among the poets of Islam, while the\r\ncelebrated collector of Pre-islamic poetry, Abú ‘Amr b. al-‘Alá,\r\ndeclared that if Akhṭal had lived a single day in the Pagan Age he\r\nwould not have preferred any one to him. His supremacy in panegyric was\r\nacknowledged by Farazdaq, and he himself claims to have surpassed all\r\ncompetitors in three styles, viz., panegyric, satire, and erotic poetry;\r\nbut there is more justification for the boast that his satires might be\r\nrecited _virginibus_--he does not add _puerisque_--without causing a\r\nblush.[463]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farazdaq.]\r\n\r\nHammám b. Ghálib, generally known as Farazdaq, belonged to the tribe of\r\nTamím, and was born at Baṣra towards the end of ‘Umar's Caliphate,\r\nHis grandfather, Ṣa‘ṣa‘a, won renown in Pre-islamic times by\r\nransoming the lives of female infants whom their parents had condemned\r\nto die (on account of which he received the title, _Muḥyi\r\n’l-Maw’údát_, 'He who brings the buried girls to life'), and his father\r\nwas likewise imbued with the old Bedouin traditions of liberality and\r\nhonour, which were rapidly growing obsolete among the demoralised\r\npopulace of ‘Iráq. Farazdaq was a _mauvais sujet_ of the type\r\nrepresented by François Villon, reckless, dissolute, and thoroughly\r\nunprincipled: apart from his gift of vituperation, we find nothing in\r\nhim to admire save his respect for his father's memory and his constant\r\ndevotion to the House of ‘Alí, a devotion which he scorned to conceal;\r\nso that he was cast into prison by the Caliph Hishám for reciting in his\r\npresence a glowing panegyric on ‘Alí's grandson, Zaynu ’l-‘Ábidín. The\r\ntragic fate of Ḥusayn at Karbalá affected him deeply, and he called\r\non his compatriots to acquit themselves like men--\r\n\r\n \"If ye avenge not him, the son of the best of you,\r\n  Then fling, fling the sword away and naught but the spindle ply.\"[464]\r\n\r\nWhile still a young man, he was expelled from his native city in\r\nconsequence of the lampoons which he directed against a noble family of\r\nBaṣra, the Banú Nahshal. Thereupon he fled to Medína, where he\r\nplunged into gallantry and dissipation until a shameless description of\r\none of his intrigues again drew upon him the sentence of banishment. His\r\npoems contain many references to his cousin Nawár, whom, by means of a\r\ndiscreditable trick, he forced to marry him when she was on the point of\r\ngiving her hand to another. The pair were ever quarrelling, and at last\r\nFarazdaq consented to an irrevocable divorce, which was witnessed by\r\nḤasan of Baṣra, the famous theologian. No sooner was the act\r\ncomplete than Farazdaq began to wish it undone, and he spoke the\r\nfollowing verses:--[465]\r\n\r\n \"I feel repentance like al-Kusa‘í,[466]\r\n  Now that Nawár has been divorced by me.\r\n  She was my Paradise which I have lost,\r\n  Like Adam when the Lord's command he crossed.\r\n  I am one who wilfully puts out his eyes,\r\n  Then dark to him the shining day doth rise!\"\r\n\r\n'The repentance of Farazdaq,' signifying bitter regret or\r\ndisappointment, passed into a proverb. He died a few months before Jarír\r\nin 728 A.D., a year also made notable by the deaths of two illustrious\r\ndivines, Ḥasan of Baṣra and Ibn Sírín.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jarír.]\r\n\r\nJarír b. ‘Atiyya belonged to Kulayb, a branch of the same tribe, Tamím,\r\nwhich produced Farazdaq. He was the court-poet of Ḥajjáj, the dreaded\r\ngovernor of ‘Iráq, and eulogised his patron in such extravagant terms as\r\nto arouse the jealousy of the Caliph ‘Abdu ’l-Malik, who consequently\r\nreceived him, on his appearance at Damascus, with marked coldness and\r\nhauteur. But when, after several repulses, he at length obtained\r\npermission to recite a poem which he had composed in honour of the\r\nprince, and came to the verse--\r\n\r\n \"Are not ye the best of those who on camel ride,\r\n  More open-handed than all in the world beside?\"--\r\n\r\nthe Caliph sat up erect on his throne and exclaimed: \"Let us be praised\r\nlike this or in silence!\"[467] Jarír's fame as a satirist stood so high\r\nthat to be worsted by him was reckoned a greater distinction than to\r\nvanquish any one else. The blind poet, Bashshár b. Burd († 783 A.D.),\r\nsaid: \"I satirised Jarír, but he considered me too young for him to\r\nnotice. Had he answered me, I should have been the finest poet in the\r\nworld.\"[468] The following anecdote shows that vituperation launched by\r\na master like Jarír was a deadly and far-reaching weapon which degraded\r\nits victim in the eyes of his contemporaries, however he might deserve\r\ntheir esteem, and covered his family and tribe with lasting disgrace.\r\n\r\n  There was a poet of repute, well known by the name of Rá‘i ’l-ibil\r\n  (Camel-herd), who loudly published his opinion that Farazdaq was\r\n  superior to Jarír, although the latter had lauded his tribe, the\r\n  Banú Numayr, whereas Farazdaq had made verses against them. One day\r\n  Jarír met him and expostulated with him but got no reply. Rá‘í was\r\n  riding a mule and was accompanied by his son, Jandal, who said to\r\n  his father: \"Why do you halt before this dog of the Banú Kulayb, as\r\n  though you had anything to hope or fear from him?\" At the same time\r\n  he gave the mule a lash with his whip. The animal started violently\r\n  and kicked Jarír, who was standing by, so that his cap fell to the\r\n  ground. Rá‘í took no heed and went on his way. Jarír picked up the\r\n  cap, brushed it, and replaced it on his head. Then he exclaimed in\r\n  verse:--\r\n\r\n   \"_O Jandal! what will say Numayr of you\r\n     When my dishonouring shaft has pierced thy sire?_\"\r\n\r\n  He returned home full of indignation, and after the evening prayer,\r\n  having called for a jar of date-wine and a lamp, he set about his\r\n  work. An old woman in the house heard him muttering, and mounted the\r\n  stairs to see what ailed him. She found him crawling naked on his\r\n  bed, by reason of that which was within him; so she ran down, crying\r\n  \"He is mad,\" and described what she had seen to the people of the\r\n  house. \"Get thee gone,\" they said, \"we know what he is at.\" By\r\n  daybreak Jarír had composed a satire of eighty verses against the\r\n  Banú Numayr. When he finished the poem, he shouted triumphantly,\r\n  \"_Allah Akbar!_\" and rode away to the place where he expected to\r\n  find Rá‘í ’l-ibil and Farazdaq and their friends. He did not salute\r\n  Rá‘í but immediately began to recite. While he was speaking Farazdaq\r\n  and Rá‘í bowed their heads, and the rest of the company sat\r\n  listening in silent mortification. When Jarír uttered the final\r\n  words--\r\n\r\n  \"_Cast down thine eyes for shame! for thou art of\r\n    Numayr--no peer of Ka‘b nor yet Kiláb_\"--\r\n\r\n  Rá‘í rose and hastened to his lodging as fast as his mule could\r\n  carry him. \"Saddle! Saddle!\" he cried to his comrades; \"you cannot\r\n  stay here longer, Jarír has disgraced you all.\" They left Baṣra\r\n  without delay to rejoin their tribe, who bitterly reproached Rá‘í\r\n  for the ignominy which he had brought upon Numayr; and hundreds of\r\n  years afterwards his name was still a byword among his people.[469]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dhu ’l-Rumma.]\r\n\r\nNext, but next at a long interval, to the three great poets of this\r\nepoch comes Dhu ’l-Rumma (Ghaylán b. ‘Uqba), who imitated the odes of\r\nthe desert Arabs with tiresome and monotonous fidelity. The philologists\r\nof the following age delighted in his antique and difficult style, and\r\npraised him far above his merits. It was said that poetry began with\r\nImru’u ’l-Qays and ended with Dhu ’l-Rumma; which is true in the sense\r\nthat he is the last important representative of the pure Bedouin school.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prose writers of the Umayyad period.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the prose writers of the period we can make only a few\r\ngeneral observations, inasmuch as their works have almost entirely\r\nperished.[470] In this branch of literature the same secular,\r\nnon-Muḥammadan spirit prevailed which has been mentioned as\r\ncharacteristic of the poets who flourished under the Umayyad dynasty,\r\nand of the dynasty itself. Historical studies were encouraged and\r\npromoted by the court of Damascus. We have referred elsewhere to ‘Abíd\r\nb. Sharya, a native of Yemen, whose business it was to dress up the old\r\nlegends and purvey them in a readable form to the public. Another\r\nYemenite of Persian descent, Wahb b. Munabbih, is responsible for a\r\ngreat deal of the fabulous lore belonging to the domain of _Awá’il_\r\n(Origins) which Moslem chroniclers commonly prefix to their historical\r\nworks. There seems to have been an eager demand for narratives of the\r\nEarly Wars of Islam (_maghází_). It is related that the Caliph ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Malik, seeing one of these books in the hands of his son, ordered it\r\nto be burnt, and enjoined him to study the Koran instead. This anecdote\r\nshows on the part of ‘Abdu ’l-Malik a pious feeling with which he is\r\nseldom credited,[471] but it shows also that histories of a legendary\r\nand popular character preceded those which were based, like the\r\n_Maghází_ of Músá b. ‘Uqba († 758 A.D.) and Ibn Isḥáq's _Biography of\r\nthe Prophet_, upon religious tradition. No work of the former class has\r\nbeen preserved. The strong theological influence which asserted itself\r\nin the second century of the Hijra was unfavourable to the development\r\nof an Arabian prose literature on national lines. In the meantime,\r\nhowever, learned doctors of divinity began to collect and write down the\r\n_Ḥadíths_. We have a solitary relic of this sort in the _Kitábu\r\n’l-Zuhd_ (Book of Asceticism) by Asad b. Músá († 749 A.D.). The most\r\nrenowned traditionist of the Umayyad age is Muḥammad b. Muslim b.\r\nShiháb al-Zuhrí († 742 A.D.), who distinguished himself by accepting\r\njudicial office under the tyrants; an act of complaisance to which his\r\nmore stiff-necked and conscientious brethren declined to stoop.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The non-Arabian Moslems.]\r\n\r\nIt was the lust of conquest even more than missionary zeal that caused\r\nthe Arabs to invade Syria and Persia and to settle on foreign soil,\r\nwhere they lived as soldiers at the expense of the native population\r\nwhom they inevitably regarded as an inferior race. If the latter thought\r\nto win respect by embracing the religion of their conquerors, they found\r\nthemselves sadly mistaken. The new converts were attached as clients\r\n(_Mawálí_, sing. _Mawlá_) to an Arab tribe: they could not become\r\nMoslems on any other footing. Far from obtaining the equal rights which\r\nthey coveted, and which, according to the principles of Islam, they\r\nshould have enjoyed, the _Mawálí_ were treated by their aristocratic\r\npatrons with contempt, and had to submit to every kind of social\r\ndegradation, while instead of being exempted from the capitation-tax\r\npaid by non-Moslems, they still remained liable to the ever-increasing\r\nexactions of Government officials. And these 'Clients,' be it\r\nremembered, were not ignorant serfs, but men whose culture was\r\nacknowledged by the Arabs themselves--men who formed the backbone of the\r\ninfluential learned class and ardently prosecuted those studies,\r\nDivinity and Jurisprudence, which were then held in highest esteem. Here\r\nwas a situation full of danger. Against Shí‘ites and Khárijites the\r\nUmayyads might claim with some show of reason to represent the cause of\r\nlaw and order, if not of Islam; against the bitter cry of the oppressed\r\n_Mawálí_ they had no argument save the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Presages of the Revolution.]\r\n\r\nWe have referred above to the universal belief of Moslems in a Messiah\r\nand to the extraordinary influence of that belief on their religious and\r\npolitical history. No wonder that in this unhappy epoch thousands of\r\npeople, utterly disgusted with life as they found it, should have\r\nindulged in visions of 'a good time coming,' which was expected to\r\ncoincide with the end of the first century of the Hijra. Mysterious\r\npredictions, dark sayings attributed to Muḥammad himself, prophecies\r\nof war and deliverance floated to and fro. Men pored over apocryphal\r\nbooks, and asked whether the days of confusion and slaughter\r\n(_al-harj_), which, it is known, shall herald the appearance of the\r\nMahdí, had not actually begun.\r\n\r\nThe final struggle was short and decisive. When it closed, the Umayyads\r\nand with them the dominion of the Arabs had passed away. Alike in\r\npolitics and literature, the Persian race asserted its supremacy. We\r\nshall now relate the story of this Revolution as briefly as possible,\r\nleaving the results to be considered in a new chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Abbásids.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Abbásid propaganda in Khurásán.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Shí‘ite missionaries (_du‘át_, sing. _dá‘í_) were actively\r\nengaged in canvassing for their party, which, as we have seen,\r\nrecognised in ‘Alí and his descendants the only legitimate successors to\r\nMuḥammad, another branch of the Prophet's family--the ‘Abbásids--had\r\nentered the field with the secret intention of turning the labours of\r\nthe ‘Alids to their own advantage. From their ancestor, ‘Abbás, the\r\nProphet's uncle, they inherited those qualities of caution, duplicity,\r\nand worldly wisdom which ensure success in political intrigue.\r\n‘Abdulláh, the son of ‘Abbás, devoted his talents to theology and\r\ninterpretation of the Koran. He \"passes for one of the strongest pillars\r\nof religious tradition; but, in the eyes of unprejudiced European\r\nresearch, he is only a crafty liar.\" His descendants \"lived in deep\r\nretirement in Ḥumayma, a little place to the south of the Dead Sea,\r\nseemingly far withdrawn from the world, but which, on account of its\r\nproximity to the route by which Syrian pilgrims went to Mecca, afforded\r\nopportunities for communication with the remotest lands of Islam. From\r\nthis centre they carried on the propaganda in their own behalf with the\r\nutmost skill. They had genius enough to see that the best soil for their\r\nefforts was the distant Khurásán--that is, the extensive north-eastern\r\nprovinces of the old Persian Empire.\"[472] These countries were\r\ninhabited by a brave and high-spirited people who in consequence of\r\ntheir intolerable sufferings under the Umayyad tyranny, the devastation\r\nof their homes and the almost servile condition to which they had been\r\nreduced, were eager to join in any desperate enterprise that gave them\r\nhope of relief. Moreover, the Arabs in Khurásán were already to a large\r\nextent Persianised: they had Persian wives, wore trousers, drank wine,\r\nand kept the festivals of Nawrúz and Mihrgán; while the Persian language\r\nwas generally understood and even spoken among them.[473] Many\r\ninteresting details as to the methods of the ‘Abbásid emissaries will be\r\nfound in Van Vloten's admirable work.[474] Starting from Kúfa, the\r\nresidence of the Grand Master who directed the whole agitation, they\r\nwent to and fro in the guise of merchants or pilgrims, cunningly\r\nadapting their doctrine to the intelligence of those whom they sought to\r\nenlist. Like the Shí‘ites, they canvassed for 'the House of the\r\nProphet,' an ambiguous expression which might equally well be applied to\r\nthe descendants of ‘Alí or of ‘Abbás, as is shown by the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HÁSHIM.\r\n                                    │\r\n                           ‘Abdu ’l-Muṭṭalib.\r\n                                    │\r\n       ----------------------------------------------------\r\n       │                            │                │\r\n  ‘Abdulláh.                   Abú Ṭálib.         ‘Abbás.\r\n       │                            │\r\n  Muḥammad (the Prophet).         ‘Alí (married to Fáṭima, daughter of\r\n                                          the Prophet).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Shí‘ites join hands with the ‘Abbásids.]\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, absolutely essential to the ‘Abbásids that they\r\nshould be able to count on the support of the powerful Shí‘ite\r\norganisation, which, ever since the abortive rebellion headed by Mukhtár\r\n(see p. 218 _supra_) had drawn vast numbers of Persian _Mawálí_ into its\r\nranks. Now, of the two main parties of the Shí‘a, viz., the Háshimites\r\nor followers of Muḥammad Ibnu ’l-Ḥanafiyya, and the Imámites, who\r\npinned their faith to the descendants of the Prophet through his\r\ndaughter Fáṭima, the former had virtually identified themselves with\r\nthe ‘Abbásids, inasmuch as the Imám Abú Háshim, who died in 716 A.D.,\r\nbequeathed his hereditary rights to Muḥammad b. ‘Alí, the head of the\r\nHouse of ‘Abbás. It only remained to hoodwink the Imámites. Accordingly\r\nthe ‘Abbásid emissaries were instructed to carry on their propaganda in\r\nthe name of Háshim, the common ancestor of ‘Abbás and ‘Alí. By means of\r\nthis ruse they obtained a free hand in Khurásán, and made such progress\r\nthat the governor of that province, Naṣr b. Sayyár, wrote to the\r\nUmayyad Caliph, Marwán, asking for reinforcements, and informing him\r\nthat two hundred thousand men had sworn allegiance to Abú Muslim, the\r\nprincipal ‘Abbásid agent. At the foot of his letter he added these\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n \"I see the coal's red glow beneath the embers,\r\n        And 'tis about to blaze!\r\n  The rubbing of two sticks enkindles fire,\r\n        And out of words come frays.\r\n  'Oh! is Umayya's House awake or sleeping?'\r\n        I cry in sore amaze.\"[475]\r\n\r\nWe have other verses by this gallant and loyal officer in which he\r\nimplores the Arab troops stationed in Khurásán, who were paralysed by\r\ntribal dissensions, to turn their swords against \"a mixed rabble without\r\nreligion or nobility\":--\r\n\r\n \"'Death to the Arabs'--that is all their creed.\"[476]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of war.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú Muslim.]\r\n\r\nThese warnings, however, were of no avail, and on June 9th, A.D. 747,\r\nAbú Muslim displayed the black banner of the ‘Abbásids at Siqadanj, near\r\nMerv, which city he occupied a few months later. The triumphant advance\r\nof the armies of the Revolution towards Damascus recalls the celebrated\r\ncampaign of Cæsar, when after crossing the Rubicon he marched on Rome.\r\nNor is Abú Muslim, though a freedman of obscure parentage--he was\r\ncertainly no Arab--unworthy to be compared with the great patrician. \"He\r\nunited,\" says Nöldeke, \"with an agitator's adroitness and perfect\r\nunscrupulosity in the choice of means the energy and clear outlook of a\r\ngeneral and statesman, and even of a monarch.\"[477] Grim, ruthless,\r\ndisdaining the pleasures of ordinary men, he possessed the faculty in\r\nwhich Cæsar excelled of inspiring blind obedience and enthusiastic\r\ndevotion. To complete the parallel, we may mention here that Abú Muslim\r\nwas treacherously murdered by Manṣúr, the second Caliph of the House\r\nwhich he had raised to the throne, from motives exactly resembling those\r\nwhich Shakespeare has put in the mouth of Brutus--\r\n\r\n                                \"So Caesar may:\r\n  Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel\r\n  Will bear no colour for the thing he is,\r\n  Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,\r\n  Would run to these and these extremities;\r\n  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg\r\n  Which, hatched, would as his kind grow mischievous,\r\n  And kill him in the shell.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Abu ’l-‘Abbás al-Saffáḥ.]\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the Umayyads was hastened by the perfidy and selfishness\r\nof the Arabs on whom they relied: the old feud between Muḍar and\r\nYemen broke out afresh, and while the Northern group remained loyal to\r\nthe dynasty, those of Yemenite stock more or less openly threw in their\r\nlot with the Revolution. We need not attempt to trace the course of the\r\nunequal contest. Everywhere the Arabs, disheartened and divided, fell an\r\neasy prey to their adversaries, and all was lost when Marwán, the last\r\nUmayyad Caliph, sustained a crushing defeat on the River Záb in\r\nBabylonia (January, A.D. 750). Meanwhile Abu ’l-‘Abbás, the head of the\r\nrival House, had already received homage as Caliph (November, 749 A.D.).\r\nIn the inaugural address which he delivered in the great Mosque of Kúfa,\r\nhe called himself _al-Saffáḥ_, _i.e._, 'the Blood-shedder,'[478] and\r\nthis title has deservedly stuck to him, though it might have been\r\nassumed with no less justice by his brother Mansúr and other members of\r\nhis family. All Umayyads were remorselessly hunted down and massacred in\r\ncold blood--even those who surrendered only on the strength of the most\r\nsolemn pledges that they had nothing to fear. A small remnant made their\r\nescape, or managed to find shelter until the storm of fury and\r\nvengeance, which spared neither the dead nor the living,[479] had blown\r\nover. One stripling, named ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán, fled to North Africa, and\r\nafter meeting with many perilous adventures founded a new Umayyad\r\ndynasty in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CALIPHS OF BAGHDÁD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annals of the ‘Abbásid dynasty from the accession of Saffáḥ (A.D.\r\n749) to the death of Musta‘ṣim, and the destruction of Baghdád by the\r\nMongols (A.D. 1258) make a round sum of five centuries. I propose to\r\nsketch the history of this long period in three chapters, of which the\r\nfirst will offer a general view of the more important literary and\r\npolitical developments so far as is possible in the limited space at my\r\ncommand; the second will be devoted to the great poets, scholars,\r\nhistorians, philosophers, and scientists who flourished in this, the\r\nGolden Age of Muḥammadan literature; while in the third some account\r\nwill be given of the chief religious movements and of the trend of\r\nreligious thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political results of the Revolution.]\r\n\r\nThe empire founded by the Caliph ‘Umar and administered by the Umayyads\r\nwas essentially, as the reader will have gathered, a military\r\norganisation for the benefit of the paramount race. In theory, no doubt,\r\nall Moslems were equal, but in fact the Arabs alone ruled--a privilege\r\nwhich national pride conspired with personal interest to maintain. We\r\nhave seen how the Persian Moslems asserted their right to a share in the\r\ngovernment. The Revolution which enthroned the ‘Abbásids marks the\r\nbeginning of a Moslem, as opposed to an Arabian, Empire. The new\r\ndynasty, owing its rise to the people of Persia, and especially of\r\nKhurásán, could exist only by establishing a balance of power between\r\nPersians and Arabs. That this policy was not permanently successful will\r\nsurprise no one who considers the widely diverse characteristics of the\r\ntwo races, but for the next fifty years the rivals worked together in\r\ntolerable harmony, thanks to the genius of Manṣúr and the\r\nconciliatory influence of the Barmecides, by whose overthrow the\r\nalliance was virtually dissolved. In the ensuing civil war between the\r\nsons of Hárún al-Rashíd the Arabs fought on the side of Amín while the\r\nPersians supported Ma’mún, and henceforth each race began to follow an\r\nindependent path. The process of separation, however, was very gradual,\r\nand long before it was completed the religious and intellectual life of\r\nboth nationalities had become inseparably mingled in the full stream of\r\nMoslem civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The choice of a new capital.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foundation of Baghdád.]\r\n\r\nThe centre of this civilisation was the province of ‘Iráq (Babylonia),\r\nwith its renowned metropolis, Baghdád, 'the City of Peace' (_Madínatu\r\n’l-Salám_). Only here could the ‘Abbásids feel themselves at home.\r\n\"Damascus, peopled by the dependants of the Omayyads, was out of the\r\nquestion. On the one hand it was too far from Persia, whence the power\r\nof the ‘Abbásids was chiefly derived; on the other hand it was\r\ndangerously near the Greek frontier, and from here, during the troublous\r\nreigns of the last Omayyads, hostile incursions on the part of the\r\nChristians had begun to avenge former defeats. It was also beginning to\r\nbe evident that the conquests of Islam would, in the future, lie to the\r\neastward towards Central Asia, rather than to the westward at the\r\nfurther expense of the Byzantines. Damascus, on the highland of Syria,\r\nlay, so to speak, dominating the Mediterranean and looking westward, but\r\nthe new capital that was to supplant it must face east, be near Persia,\r\nand for the needs of commerce have water communication with the sea.\r\nHence everything pointed to a site on either the Euphrates or the\r\nTigris, and the ‘Abbásids were not slow to make their choice.\"[480]\r\nAfter carefully examining various sites, the Caliph Manṣúr fixed on a\r\nlittle Persian village, on the west bank of the Tigris, called Baghdád,\r\nwhich, being interpreted, means 'given (or 'founded') by God'; and in\r\nA.D. 762 the walls of the new city began to rise. Manṣúr laid the\r\nfirst brick with his own hand, and the work was pushed forward with\r\nastonishing rapidity under his personal direction by masons, architects,\r\nand surveyors, whom he gathered out of different countries, so that 'the\r\nRound City,' as he planned it, was actually finished within the short\r\nspace of four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Despotic character of ‘Abbásid rule.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Vizier.]\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances which caused the seat of empire to be transferred\r\nto Baghdád brought about a corresponding change in the whole system of\r\ngovernment. Whereas the Umayyads had been little more than heads of a\r\nturbulent Arabian aristocracy, their successors reverted to the old type\r\nof Oriental despotism with which the Persians had been familiar since\r\nthe days of Darius and Xerxes. Surrounded by a strong bodyguard of\r\ntroops from Khurásán, on whose devotion they could rely, the ‘Abbásids\r\nruled with absolute authority over the lives and properties or their\r\nsubjects, even as the Sásánian monarchs had ruled before them. Persian\r\nfashions were imitated at the court, which was thronged with the\r\nCaliph's relatives and freedmen (not to mention his womenfolk), besides\r\na vast array of uniformed and decorated officials. Chief amongst these\r\nlatter stood two personages who figure prominently in the _Arabian\r\nNights_--the Vizier and the Executioner. The office of Vizier is\r\nprobably of Persian origin, although in Professor De Goeje's opinion the\r\nword itself is Arabic.[481] The first who bore this title in ‘Abbásid\r\ntimes was Abú Salama, the minister of Saffáḥ: he was called _Wazíru\r\nÁli Muḥammadin_, 'the Vizier of Muḥammad's Family.' It was the\r\nduty of the Vizier to act as intermediary between the omnipotent\r\nsovereign and his people, to counsel him in affairs of State, and, above\r\nall, to keep His Majesty in good humour. He wielded enormous power, but\r\nwas exposed to every sort of intrigue, and never knew when he might be\r\ninterned in a dungeon or despatched in the twinkling of an eye by the\r\ngrim functionary presiding over the _naṭ‘_, or circular carpet of\r\nleather, which lay beside the throne and served as a scaffold.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two periods of ‘Abbásid history.]\r\n\r\nWe can distinguish two periods in the history of the ‘Abbásid House: one\r\nof brilliant prosperity inaugurated by Manṣúr and including the\r\nreigns of Mahdí, Hárún al-Rashíd, Ma’mún, Mu‘tasim, and Wáthiq--that is\r\nto say, nearly a hundred years in all (754-847 A.D.); the other, more\r\nthan four times as long, commencing with Mutawakkil (847-861 A.D.)--a\r\nperiod of decline rapidly sinking, after a brief interval which gave\r\npromise of better things, into irremediable decay.[482]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reign of Manṣúr (754-775 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outbreaks in Persia.]\r\n\r\nCruel and treacherous, like most of his family, Abú Ja‘far Manṣúr was\r\nperhaps the greatest ruler whom the ‘Abbásids produced.[483] He had to\r\nfight hard for his throne. The ‘Alids, who deemed themselves the true\r\nheirs of the Prophet in virtue of their descent from Fáṭima, rose in\r\nrebellion against the usurper, surprised him in an unguarded moment, and\r\ndrove him to such straits that during seven weeks he never changed his\r\ndress except for public prayers. But once more the ‘Alids proved\r\nincapable of grasping their opportunity. The leaders, Muḥammad, who\r\nwas known as 'The Pure Soul' (_al-Nafs al-zakiyya_), and his brother\r\nIbráhím, fell on the battle-field. Under Mahdí and Hárún members of the\r\nHouse of ‘Alí continued to 'come out,' but with no better success. In\r\nEastern Persia, where strong national feelings interwove themselves with\r\nPre-Muḥammadan religious ideas, those of Mazdak and Zoroaster in\r\nparticular, the ‘Abbásids encountered a formidable opposition which\r\nproclaimed its vigour and tenacity by the successive revolts of Sinbádh\r\nthe Magian (755-756 A.D.), Ustádhsís (766-768), Muqanna‘, the 'Veiled\r\nProphet of Khurásán' (780-786), and Bábak the Khurramite (816-838).[484]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manṣúr's advice to Mahdí.]\r\n\r\nManṣúr said to his son Mahdi, \"O Abú ‘Abdalláh, when you sit in\r\ncompany, always have divines to converse with you; for Muḥammad b.\r\nShiháb al-Zuhrí said, 'The word _ḥadíth_ (Apostolic Tradition) is\r\nmasculine: only virile men love it, and only effeminate men dislike it';\r\nand he spoke the truth.\"[485]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manṣúr and the poet.]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a poet came to Mahdí, who was then heir-apparent, at\r\nRayy, and recited a panegyric in his honour. The prince gave him 20,000\r\ndirhems. Thereupon the postmaster of Rayy informed Manṣúr, who wrote\r\nto his son reproaching him for such extravagance. \"What you should have\r\ndone,\" he said, \"was to let him wait a year at your door, and after that\r\ntime bestow on him 4,000 dirhems.\" He then caused the poet to be\r\narrested and brought into his presence. \"You went to a heedless youth\r\nand cajoled him?\" \"Yes, God save the Commander of the Faithful, I went\r\nto a heedless, generous youth and cajoled him, and he suffered himself\r\nto be cajoled.\" \"Recite your eulogy of him.\" The poet obeyed, not\r\nforgetting to conclude his verses with a compliment to Manṣúr.\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried the Caliph, \"but they are not worth 20,000 dirhems. Where\r\nis the money?\" On its being produced he made him a gift of 4,000 dirhems\r\nand confiscated the remainder.[486]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Barmecides.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Yaḥyá b. Khálid.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding irreconcilable parties--‘Alids, Persian extremists, and\r\n(we may add) Khárijites--the policy of _rapprochement_ was on the whole\r\nextraordinarily effective. In carrying it out the Caliphs received\r\npowerful assistance from a noble and ancient Persian family, the\r\ncelebrated Barmakites or Barmecides. According to Mas‘údí,[487] Barmak\r\nwas originally a title borne by the High Priest (_sádin_) of the great\r\nMagian fire-temple at Balkh. Khálid, the son of one of these\r\ndignitaries--whence he and his descendants were called Barmakites\r\n(_Barámika_)--held the most important offices of state under Saffáḥ\r\nand Manṣúr. Yaḥyá, the son of Khálid, was entrusted with the\r\neducation of Hárún al-Rashíd, and on the accession of the young prince\r\nhe was appointed Grand Vizier. \"My dear father!\" said the Caliph, \"it is\r\nthrough the blessings and the good fortune which attend you, and through\r\nyour excellent management, that I am seated on the throne;[488] so I\r\ncommit to you the direction of affairs.\" He then handed to him his\r\nsignet-ring. Yaḥyá was distinguished (says the biographer) for\r\nwisdom, nobleness of mind, and elegance of language.[489] Although he\r\ntook a truly Persian delight in philosophical discussion, for which\r\npurpose freethinking scholars and eminent heretics used often to meet\r\nin his house, he was careful to observe the outward forms of piety. It\r\nmay be said of the ‘Abbásids generally that, whatever they might do or\r\nthink in private, they wore the official badge of Islam ostentatiously\r\non their sleeves. The following verses which Yaḥyá addressed to his\r\nson Faḍl are very characteristic:--[490]\r\n\r\n \"Seek glory while 'tis day, no effort spare,\r\n  And patiently the loved one's absence bear;\r\n  But when the shades of night advancing slow\r\n  O'er every vice a veil of darkness throw,\r\n  Beguile the hours with all thy heart's delight:\r\n  The day of prudent men begins at night.\r\n  Many there be, esteemed of life austere,\r\n  Who nightly enter on a strange career.\r\n  Night o'er them keeps her sable curtain drawn,\r\n  And merrily they pass from eve to dawn.\r\n  Who but a fool his pleasures would expose\r\n  To spying rivals and censorious foes?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of the Barmecides (803 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nFor seventeen years Yaḥyá and his two sons, Faḍl and Ja‘far,\r\nremained deep in Hárún's confidence and virtual rulers of the State\r\nuntil, from motives which have been variously explained, the Caliph\r\nresolved to rid himself of the whole family. The story is too well known\r\nto need repetition.[491] Ja‘far alone was put to death: we may conclude,\r\ntherefore, that he had specially excited the Caliph's anger; and those\r\nwho ascribe the catastrophe to his romantic love-affair with Hárún's\r\nsister, ‘Abbása, are probably in the right.[492] Hárún himself seems to\r\nhave recognised, when it was too late, how much he owed to these great\r\nPersian barons whose tactful administration, unbounded generosity, and\r\nmunificent patronage of literature have shed immortal lustre on his\r\nreign. Afterwards, if any persons spoke ill of the Barmecides in his\r\npresence, he would say (quoting the verse of Ḥuṭay’a):--[493]\r\n\r\n \"O slanderers, be your sire of sire bereft![494]\r\n  Give o'er, or fill the gap which they have left.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hárún al-Rashíd (786-809 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nHárún's orthodoxy, his liberality, his victories over the Byzantine\r\nEmperor Nicephorus, and last but not least the literary brilliance of\r\nhis reign have raised him in popular estimation far above all the other\r\nCaliphs: he is the Charlemagne of the East, while the entrancing pages\r\nof the _Thousand and One Nights_ have made his name a household word in\r\nevery country of Europe. Students of Moslem history will soon discover\r\nthat \"the good Haroun Alraschid\" was in fact a perfidious and irascible\r\ntyrant, whose fitful amiability and real taste for music and letters\r\nhardly entitle him to be described either as a great monarch or a good\r\nman. We must grant, however, that he thoroughly understood the noble art\r\nof patronage. The poets Abú Nuwás, Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya, Di‘bil, Muslim b.\r\nWalíd, and ‘Abbás b. Aḥnaf; the musician Ibráhím of Mosul and his son\r\nIsḥáq; the philologists Abú ‘Ubayda, Aṣma‘í, and Kisá’í; the\r\npreacher Ibnu ’l-Sammák; and the historian Wáqidí--these are but a few\r\nnames in the galaxy of talent which he gathered around him at Baghdád.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amín and Ma’mún (809-833 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Barmecides revived the spirit of racial antagonism which\r\nthey had done their best to lay, and an open rupture was rendered\r\ninevitable by the short-sighted policy of Hárún with regard to the\r\nsuccession. He had two grown-up sons, Amín, by his wife and cousin\r\nZubayda, and Ma’mún, whose mother was a Persian slave. It was arranged\r\nthat the Caliphate should pass to Amín and after him to his brother, but\r\nthat the Empire should be divided between them. Amín was to receive\r\n‘Iráq and Syria, Ma’mún the eastern provinces, where the people would\r\ngladly welcome a ruler of their own blood. The struggle for supremacy\r\nwhich began almost immediately on the death of Hárún was in the main one\r\nof Persians against Arabs, and by Ma’mún's triumph the Barmecides were\r\namply avenged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ma’mún's heresies.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of independent dynasties.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish mercenaries introduced.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of the Caliphate.]\r\n\r\nThe new Caliph was anything but orthodox. He favoured the Shí‘ite party\r\nto such an extent that he even nominated the ‘Alid, ‘Alí b. Músá b.\r\nJa‘far al-Riḍá, as heir-apparent--a step which alienated the members\r\nof his own family and led to his being temporarily deposed. He also\r\nadopted the opinions of the Mu‘tazilite sect and established an\r\nInquisition to enforce them. Hence the Sunnite historian, Abu\r\n’l-Maḥásin, enumerates three principal heresies of which Ma’mún was\r\nguilty: (1) His wearing of the Green (_labsu ’l-Khuḍra_)[495] and\r\ncourting the ‘Alids and repulsing the ‘Abbásids; (2) his affirming that\r\nthe Koran was created (_al-qawl bi-Khalqi ’l-Qur’án_); and (3) his\r\nlegalisation of the _mut‘a_, a loose form of marriage prevailing amongst\r\nthe Shí‘ites.[496] We shall see in due course how keenly and with what\r\nfruitful results Ma’mún interested himself in literature and science.\r\nNevertheless, it cannot escape our attention that in this splendid reign\r\nthere appear ominous signs of political decay. In 822 A.D. Ṭáhir, one\r\nof Ma’mún's generals, who had been appointed governor of Khurásán,\r\nomitted the customary mention of the Caliph's name from the Friday\r\nsermon (_khuṭba_), thus founding the Ṭahirid dynasty, which,\r\nthough professing allegiance to the Caliphs, was practically\r\nindependent. Ṭáhir was only the first of a long series of ambitious\r\ngovernors and bold adventurers who profited by the weakening authority\r\nof the Caliphs to carve out kingdoms for themselves. Moreover, the\r\nMoslems of ‘Iráq had lost their old warlike spirit: they were fine\r\nscholars and merchants, but poor soldiers. So it came about that\r\nMa’mún's successor, the Caliph Mu‘taṣim (833-842 A.D.), took the\r\nfatal step of surrounding himself with a Prætorian Guard chiefly\r\ncomposed of Turkish recruits from Transoxania. At the same time he\r\nremoved his court from Baghdád sixty miles further up the Tigris to\r\nSámarrá, which suddenly grew into a superb city of palaces and\r\nbarracks--an Oriental Versailles.[497] Here we may close our brief\r\nreview of the first and flourishing period of the ‘Abbásid Caliphate.\r\nDuring the next four centuries the Caliphs come and go faster than ever,\r\nbut for the most part their authority is precarious, if not purely\r\nnominal. Meanwhile, in the provinces of the Empire petty dynasties\r\narise, only to eke out an obscure and troubled existence, or powerful\r\nstates are formed, which carry on the traditions of Muḥammadan\r\nculture, it may be through many generations, and in some measure restore\r\nthe blessings of peace and settled government to an age surfeited with\r\nanarchy and bloodshed. Of these provincial empires we have now\r\nprincipally to speak, confining our view, for the most part, to the\r\npolitical outlines, and reserving the literary and religious aspects of\r\nthe period for fuller consideration elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Second ‘Abbásid Period (847-1258 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe reigns of Mutawakkil (847-861 A.D.) and his immediate successors\r\nexhibit all the well-known features of Prætorian rule. Enormous sums\r\nwere lavished on the Turkish soldiery, who elected and deposed the\r\nCaliph just as they pleased, and enforced their insatiable demands by\r\nmutiny and assassination. For a short time (869-907 A.D.) matters\r\nimproved under the able and energetic Muhtadí and the four Caliphs who\r\nfollowed him; but the Turks soon regained the upper hand. From this date\r\nevery vestige of real power is centred in the Generalissimo (_Amíru\r\n’l-Umará_) who stands at the head of the army, while the once omnipotent\r\nCaliph must needs be satisfied with the empty honour of having his name\r\nstamped on the coinage and celebrated in the public prayers. The\r\nterrorism of the Turkish bodyguard was broken by the Buwayhids, a\r\nPersian dynasty, who ruled in Baghdád from 945 to 1055 A.D. Then the\r\nSeljúq supremacy began with Ṭughril Beg's entry into the capital and\r\nlasted a full century until the death of Sanjar (1157 A.D.). The Mongols\r\nwho captured Baghdád in 1258 A.D. brought the pitiable farce of the\r\nCaliphate to an end.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Dynasties of the early ‘Abbásid Age.]\r\n\r\n  \"The empire of the Caliphs at its widest,\" as Stanley Lane-Poole\r\n  observes in his excellent account of the Muḥammadan dynasties,\r\n  \"extended from the Atlantic to the Indus, and from the Caspian to\r\n  the cataracts of the Nile. So vast a dominion could not long be held\r\n  together. The first step towards its disintegration began in Spain,\r\n  where ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán, a member of the suppressed Umayyad family,\r\n  was acknowledged as an independent sovereign in A.D. 755, and the\r\n  ‘Abbásid Caliphate was renounced for ever. Thirty years later Idrís,\r\n  a great-grandson of the Caliph ‘Alí, and therefore equally at\r\n  variance with ‘Abbásids and Umayyads, founded an ‘Alid dynasty in\r\n  Morocco. The rest of the North African coast was practically lost to\r\n  the Caliphate when the Aghlabid governor established his authority\r\n  at Qayrawán in A.D. 800.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dynasties of the Second Period. 872 A.D.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sámánids (874-999 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nAmongst the innumerable kingdoms which supplanted the decaying Caliphate\r\nonly a few of the most important can be singled out for special notice\r\non account of their literary or religious interest.[498] To begin with\r\nPersia: in Khurásán, which was then held by the Ṭáhirids, fell into\r\nthe hands of Ya‘qúb b. Layth the Coppersmith (_al-Ṣaffár_), founder\r\nof the Ṣaffárids, who for thirty years stretched their sway over a\r\ngreat part of Persia, until they were dispossessed by the Sámánids. The\r\nlatter dynasty had the seat of its power in Transoxania, but during the\r\nfirst half of the tenth century practically the whole of Persia\r\nsubmitted to the authority of Ismá‘íl and his famous successors, Naṣr\r\nII and Núḥ I. Not only did these princes warmly encourage and foster\r\nthe development, which had already begun, of a national literature in\r\nthe Persian language--it is enough to recall here the names of Rúdagí,\r\nthe blind minstrel and poet; Daqíqí, whose fragment of a Persian Epic\r\nwas afterwards incorporated by Firdawsí in his _Sháhnáma_; and Bal‘amí,\r\nthe Vizier of Manṣúr I, who composed an abridgment of Ṭabarí's\r\ngreat history, which is one of the oldest prose works in Persian that\r\nhave come down to us--but they extended the same favour to poets and men\r\nof learning who (though, for the most part, of Persian extraction)\r\npreferred to use the Arabic language. Thus the celebrated Rhazes (Abú\r\nBakr al-Rází) dedicated to the Sámánid prince Abú Ṣáliḥ Manṣúr\r\nb. Isháq a treatise on medicine, which he entitled _al-Kitáb\r\nal-Manṣúrí_ (the Book of Manṣúr) in honour of his patron. The\r\ngreat physician and philosopher, Abú ‘Alí b. Síná (Avicenna) relates\r\nthat, having been summoned to Bukhárá by King Núḥ, the second of that\r\nname (976-997 A.D.), he obtained permission to visit the royal library.\r\n\"I found there,\" he says, \"many rooms filled with books which were\r\narranged in cases row upon row. One room was allotted to works on Arabic\r\nphilology and poetry; another to jurisprudence, and so forth, the books\r\non each particular science having a room to themselves. I inspected the\r\ncatalogue of ancient Greek authors and looked for the books which I\r\nrequired: I saw in this collection books of which few people have heard\r\neven the names, and which I myself have never seen either before or\r\nsince.\"[499]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Buwayhids (932-1055 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe power of the Sámánids quickly reached its zenith, and about the\r\nmiddle of the tenth century they were confined to Khurásán and\r\nTransoxania, while in Western Persia their place was taken by the\r\nBuwayhids. Abú Shujá‘ Buwayh, a chieftain of Daylam, the mountainous\r\nprovince lying along the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, was one of\r\nthose soldiers of fortune whom we meet with so frequently in the history\r\nof this period. His three sons, ‘Alí, Aḥmad, and Ḥasan, embarked\r\non the same adventurous career with such energy and success, that in the\r\ncourse of thirteen years they not only subdued the provinces of Fárs and\r\nKhúzistán, but in 945 A.D. entered Baghdád at the head of their\r\nDaylamite troops and assumed the supreme command, receiving from the\r\nCaliph Mustakfí the honorary titles of ‘Imádu ’l-Dawla, Mu‘izzu\r\n’l-Dawla, and Ruknu ’l-Dawla. Among the princes of this House, who\r\nreigned over Persia and ‘Iráq during the next hundred years, the most\r\neminent was ‘Aḍudu ’l-Dawla, of whom it is said by Ibn Khallikán that\r\nnone of the Buwayhids, notwithstanding their great power and authority,\r\npossessed so extensive an empire and held sway over so many kings and\r\nkingdoms as he. The chief poets of the day, including Mutanabbí, visited\r\nhis court at Shíráz and celebrated his praises in magnificent odes. He\r\nalso built a great hospital in Baghdád, the Bímáristán al-‘Aḍudí,\r\nwhich was long famous as a school of medicine. The Viziers of the\r\nBuwayhid family contributed in a quite unusual degree to its literary\r\nrenown. Ibnu ’l-‘Amíd, the Vizier of Ruknu ’l-Dawla, surpassed in\r\nphilology and epistolary composition all his contemporaries; hence he\r\nwas called 'the second Jáḥiẓ,' and it was a common saying that\r\n\"the art of letter-writing began with ‘Abdu ’l-Ḥamíd and ended with\r\nIbnu ’l-‘Amíd.\"[500] His friend, the Ṣáḥib Ismá‘íl b. ‘Abbád,\r\nVizier to Mu’ayyidu ’l-Dawla and Fakhru ’l-Dawla, was a distinguished\r\nsavant, whose learning was only eclipsed by the liberality of his\r\npatronage. In the latter respect Sábúr b. Ardashír, the prime minister\r\nof Abú Naṣr Bahá’u ’l-Dawla, vied with the illustrious Ṣáḥib.\r\nHe had so many encomiasts that Tha‘álibí devotes to them a whole chapter\r\nof the _Yatíma_. The Academy which he founded at Baghdád, in the Karkh\r\nquarter, and generously endowed, was a favourite haunt of literary men,\r\nand its members seem to have enjoyed pretty much the same privileges as\r\nbelong to the Fellows of an Oxford or Cambridge College.[501]\r\n\r\nLike most of their countrymen, the Buwayhids were Shí‘ites in religion.\r\nWe read in the Annals of Abu ’l-Maḥásin under the year 341 A.H. = 952\r\nA.D.:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Zeal of the Buwayhids for Shí‘ite principles.]\r\n\r\n  \"In this year the Vizier al-Muhallabí arrested some persons who held\r\n  the doctrine of metempsychosis (_tanásukh_). Among them were a youth\r\n  who declared that the spirit of ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib had passed into\r\n  his body, and a woman who claimed that the spirit of Fáṭima was\r\n  dwelling in her; while another man pretended to be Gabriel. On being\r\n  flogged, they excused themselves by alleging their relationship to\r\n  the Family of the Prophet, whereupon Mu‘izzu ’l-Dawla ordered them\r\n  to be set free. This he did because of his attachment to Shí‘ism. It\r\n  is well known,\" says the author in conclusion, \"that the Buwayhids\r\n  were Shí‘ites and Ráfiḍites.\"[502]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ghaznevids (976-1186 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThree dynasties contemporary with the Buwayhids have still to be\r\nmentioned: the Ghaznevids in Afghanistan, the Ḥamdánids in Syria, and\r\nthe Fáṭimids in Egypt. Sabuktagín, the founder of the first-named\r\ndynasty, was a Turkish slave. His son, Maḥmúd, who succeeded to the\r\nthrone of Ghazna in 998 A.D., made short work of the already tottering\r\nSámánids, and then sweeping far and wide over Northern India, began a\r\nseries of conquests which, before his death in 1030 A.D., reached from\r\nLahore to Samarcand and Iṣfahán. Although the Persian and\r\nTransoxanian provinces of his huge empire were soon torn away by the\r\nSeljúqs, Maḥmúd's invasion of India, which was undertaken with the\r\nobject of winning that country for Islam, permanently established\r\nMuḥammadan influence, at any rate in the Panjáb. As regards their\r\nreligious views, the Turkish Ghaznevids stand in sharp contrast with the\r\nPersian houses of Sámán and Buwayh. It has been well said that the true\r\ngenius of the Turks lies in action, not in speculation. When Islam came\r\nacross their path, they saw that it was a simple and practical creed\r\nsuch as the soldier requires; so they accepted it without further\r\nparley. The Turks have always remained loyal to Islam, the Islam of Abú\r\nBakr and ‘Umar, which is a very different thing from the Islam of\r\nShí‘ite Persia. Maḥmúd proved his orthodoxy by banishing the\r\nMu‘tazilites of Rayy and burning their books together with the\r\nphilosophical and astronomical works that fell into his hands; but on\r\nthe same occasion he carried off a hundred camel-loads of presumably\r\nharmless literature to his capital. That he had no deep enthusiasm for\r\nletters is shown, for example, by his shabby treatment of the poet\r\nFirdawsí. Nevertheless, he ardently desired the glory and prestige\r\naccruing to a sovereign whose court formed the rallying-point of all\r\nthat was best in the literary and scientific culture of the day, and\r\nsuch was Ghazna in the eleventh century. Besides the brilliant group of\r\nPersian poets, with Firdawsí at their head, we may mention among the\r\nArabic-writing authors who flourished under this dynasty the historians\r\nal-‘Utbí and al-Bírúní.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ḥamdánids (929-1003 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nWhile the Eastern Empire of Islam was passing into the hands of Persians\r\nand Turks, we find the Arabs still holding their own in Syria and\r\nMesopotamia down to the end of the tenth century. These Arab and\r\ngenerally nomadic dynasties were seldom of much account. The\r\nḤamdánids of Aleppo alone deserve to be noticed here, and that\r\nchiefly for the sake of the peerless Sayfu ’l-Dawla, a worthy descendant\r\nof the tribe of Taghlib, which in the days of heathendom produced the\r\npoet-warrior, ‘Amr b. Kulthúm. ‘Abdulláh b. Ḥamdán was appointed\r\ngovernor of Mosul and its dependencies by the Caliph Muktafí in 905\r\nA.D., and in 942 his sons Ḥasan and ‘Alí received the complimentary\r\ntitles of Náṣiru ’l-Dawla (Defender of the State) and Sayfu ’l-Dawla\r\n(Sword of the State). Two years later Sayfu ’l-Dawla captured Aleppo and\r\nbrought the whole of Northern Syria under his dominion. During a reign\r\nof twenty-three years he was continuously engaged in harrying the\r\nByzantines on the frontiers of Asia Minor, but although he gained some\r\nglorious victories, which his laureate Mutanabbí has immortalised, the\r\nfortune of war went in the long run steadily against him, and his\r\nsuccessors were unable to preserve their little kingdom from being\r\ncrushed between the Byzantines in the north and the Fáṭtimids in the\r\nsouth. The Ḥamdánids have an especial claim on our sympathy, because\r\nthey revived for a time the fast-decaying and already almost broken\r\nspirit of Arabian nationalism. It is this spirit that speaks with a\r\npowerful voice in Mutanabbí and declares itself, for example, in such\r\nverses as these:--[503]\r\n\r\n  \"Men from their kings alone their worth derive,\r\n  But Arabs ruled by aliens cannot thrive:\r\n  Boors without culture, without noble fame,\r\n  Who know not loyalty and honour's name.\r\n  Go where thou wilt, thou seest in every land\r\n  Folk driven like cattle by a servile band.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The circle of Sayfu ’l-Dawla.]\r\n\r\nThe reputation which Sayfu ’l-Dawla's martial exploits and his repeated\r\ntriumphs over the enemies of Islam richly earned for him in the eyes of\r\nhis contemporaries was enhanced by the conspicuous energy and\r\nmunificence with which he cultivated the arts of peace. Considering the\r\nbrevity of his reign and the relatively small extent of his resources,\r\nwe may well be astonished to contemplate the unique assemblage of\r\nliterary talent then mustered in Aleppo. There was, first of all,\r\nMutanabbí, in the opinion of his countrymen the greatest of Moslem\r\npoets; there was Sayfu ’l-Dawla's cousin, the chivalrous Abú Firás,\r\nwhose war-songs are relieved by many a touch of tender and true feeling;\r\nthere was Abu ’l-Faraj of Iṣfahán, who on presenting to Sayfu\r\n’l-Dawla his _Kitábu ’l-Aghání_, one of the most celebrated and\r\nimportant works in all Arabic literature, received one thousand pieces\r\nof gold accompanied with an expression of regret that the prince was\r\nobliged to remunerate him so inadequately; there was also the great\r\nphilosopher, Abú Naṣr al-Fárábí, whose modest wants were satisfied by\r\na daily pension of four dirhems (about two shillings) from the public\r\ntreasury. Surely this is a record not easily surpassed even in the\r\nheyday of ‘Abbásid patronage. As for the writers of less note whom Sayfu\r\n’l-Dawla attracted to Aleppo, their name is legion. Space must be found\r\nfor the poets Sarí al-Raffá, Abu ’l-‘Abbás al-Námí, and Abu ’l-Faraj\r\nal-Babbaghá for the preacher (_khaṭíb_) Ibn Nubáta, who would often\r\nrouse the enthusiasm of his audience while he urged the duty of\r\nzealously prosecuting the Holy War against Christian Byzantium; and for\r\nthe philologist Ibn Khálawayh, whose lectures were attended by students\r\nfrom all parts of the Muḥammadan world. The literary renaissance\r\nwhich began at this time in Syria was still making its influence felt\r\nwhen Tha‘álibí wrote his _Yatíma_, about thirty years after the death of\r\nSayfu ’l-Dawla, and it produced in Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí (born 973\r\nA.D.) an original and highly interesting personality, to whom we shall\r\nreturn on another occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fáṭimids (909-1171 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ismá‘ílite propaganda.]\r\n\r\nThe dynasties hitherto described were political in their origin, having\r\ngenerally been founded by ambitious governors or vassals. These upstarts\r\nmade no pretensions to the nominal authority, which they left in the\r\nhands of the Caliph even while they forced him at the sword's point to\r\nrecognise their political independence. The Sámánids and Buwayhids,\r\nShí‘ites as they were, paid the same homage to the Caliph in Baghdád as\r\ndid the Sunnite Ghaznevids. But in the beginning of the tenth century\r\nthere arose in Africa a great Shí‘ite power, that of the Fáṭimids,\r\nwho took for themselves the title and prerogatives of the Caliphate,\r\nwhich they asserted to be theirs by right Divine. This event was only\r\nthe climax of a deep-laid and skilfully organised plot--one of the most\r\nextraordinary in all history. It had been put in train half a century\r\nearlier by a certain ‘Abdulláh the son of Maymún, a Persian oculist\r\n(_qaddáḥ_) belonging to Aḥwáz. Filled with a fierce hatred of the\r\nArabs and with a freethinker's contempt for Islam, ‘Abdulláh b. Maymún\r\nconceived the idea of a vast secret society which should be all things\r\nto all men, and which, by playing on the strongest passions and tempting\r\nthe inmost weaknesses of human nature, should unite malcontents of every\r\ndescription in a conspiracy to overthrow the existing _régime_. Modern\r\nreaders may find a parallel for this romantic project in the pages of\r\nDumas, although the Aramis of _Twenty Years After_ is a simpleton beside\r\n‘Abdulláh. He saw that the movement, in order to succeed, must be\r\nstarted on a religious basis, and he therefore identified himself with\r\nan obscure Shí‘ite sect, the Ismá‘ílís, who were so called because they\r\nregarded Muḥammad, son of Ismá‘íl, son of Ja‘far al-Ṣádiq, as the\r\nSeventh Imám. Under ‘Abdulláh the Ismá‘ílís developed their mystical and\r\nantinomian doctrines, of which an excellent account has been given by\r\nProfessor Browne in the first volume of his _Literary History of Persia_\r\n(p. 405 sqq.). Here we can only refer to the ingenious and fatally\r\ninsidious methods which he devised for gaining proselytes on a gigantic\r\nscale, and with such amazing success that from this time until the\r\nMongol invasion--a period of almost four centuries--the Ismá‘ílites\r\n(Fáṭimids, Carmathians, and Assassins) either ruled or ravaged a\r\ngreat part of the Muḥammadan Empire. It is unnecessary to discuss the\r\nquestion whether ‘Abdulláh b. Maymún was, as Professor Browne thinks,\r\nprimarily a religious enthusiast, or whether, according to the view\r\ncommonly held, his real motives were patriotism and personal ambition.\r\nThe history of Islam shows clearly enough that the revolutionist is\r\nnearly always disguised as a religious leader, while, on the other hand,\r\nevery founder of a militant sect is potentially the head of a state.\r\n‘Abdulláh may have been a fanatic first and a politician afterwards;\r\nmore probably he was both at once from the beginning. His plan of\r\noperations was briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\n  The _dá‘í_ or missionary charged with the task of gaining adherents\r\n  for the Hidden Imám (see p. 216 seq.), in whose name allegiance was\r\n  demanded, would settle in some place, representing himself to be a\r\n  merchant, Ṣúfí, or the like. By renouncing worldly pleasures,\r\n  making a show of strict piety, and performing apparent miracles, it\r\n  was easy for him to pass as a saint with the common folk. As soon as\r\n  he was assured of his neighbours' confidence and respect, he began\r\n  to raise doubts in their minds. He would suggest difficult problems\r\n  of theology or dwell on the mysterious significance of certain\r\n  passages of the Koran. May there not be (he would ask) in religion\r\n  itself a deeper meaning than appears on the surface? Then, having\r\n  excited the curiosity of his hearers, he suddenly breaks off. When\r\n  pressed to continue his explanation, he declares that such mysteries\r\n  cannot be communicated save to those who take a binding oath of\r\n  secrecy and obedience and consent to pay a fixed sum of money in\r\n  token of their good faith. If these conditions were accepted, the\r\n  neophyte entered upon the second of the nine degrees of initiation.\r\n  He was taught that mere observance of the laws of Islam is not\r\n  pleasing to God, unless the true doctrine be received through the\r\n  Imáms who have it in keeping. These Imáms (as he next learned) are\r\n  seven in number, beginning with ‘Alí; the seventh and last is\r\n  Muḥammad, son of Ismá‘íl. On reaching the fourth degree he\r\n  definitely ceased to be a Moslem, for here he was taught the\r\n  Ismá‘ílite system of theology in which Muḥammad b. Ismá‘íl\r\n  supersedes the founder of Islam as the greatest and last of all the\r\n  Prophets. Comparatively few initiates advanced beyond this grade to\r\n  a point where every form of positive religion was allegorised away,\r\n  and only philosophy was left. \"It is clear what a tremendous weapon,\r\n  or rather machine, was thus created. Each man was given the amount\r\n  of light which he could bear and which was suited to his prejudices,\r\n  and he was made to believe that the end of the whole work would be\r\n  the attaining of what he regarded as most desirable.\"[504] Moreover,\r\n  the Imám Muḥammad b. Ismá‘íl having disappeared long ago, the\r\n  veneration which sought a visible object was naturally transferred\r\n  to his successor and representative on earth, viz., ‘Abdulláh b.\r\n  Maymún, who filled the same office in relation to him as Aaron to\r\n  Moses and ‘Alí to Muḥammad.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the ninth century the state of the Moslem Empire was\r\nworse, if possible, than it had been in the latter days of Umayyad rule.\r\nThe peasantry of ‘Iráq were impoverished by the desolation into which\r\nthat flourishing province was beginning to fall in consequence of the\r\nfrequent and prolonged civil wars. In 869 A.D. the negro slaves (_Zanj_)\r\nemployed in the saltpetre industry, for which Baṣra was famous, took\r\nup arms at the call of an ‘Alid Messiah, and during fourteen years\r\ncarried fire and sword through Khúzistán and the adjacent territory. We\r\ncan imagine that all this misery and discontent was a godsend to the\r\nIsmá‘ílites. The old cry, \"A deliverer of the Prophet's House,\" which\r\nserved the ‘Abbásids so well against the Umayyads, was now raised with\r\nno less effect against the ‘Abbásids themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fáṭimid dynasty founded by the Mahdí ‘Ubaydu’lláh (909\r\nA.D.).]\r\n\r\n‘Abdulláh b. Maymún died in 875 A.D., but the agitation went on, and\r\nrapidly gathered force. One of the leading spirits was Ḥamdán\r\nQarmaṭ, who gave his name to the Carmathian branch of the Ismá‘ílís.\r\nThese Carmathians (_Qarámiṭa_, sing. _Qirmiṭí_) spread over\r\nSouthern Persia and Yemen, and in the tenth century they threatened\r\nBaghdád, repeatedly waylaid the pilgrim-caravans, sacked Mecca and bore\r\naway the Black Stone as a trophy; in short, established a veritable\r\nreign of terror. We must return, however, to the main Ismá‘ílite faction\r\nheaded by the descendants of ‘Abdulláh b. Maymún. Their emissaries\r\ndiscovered a promising field of work in North Africa among the credulous\r\nand fanatical Berbers. When all was ripe, Sa‘íd b. Ḥusayn, the\r\ngrandson of ‘Abdulláh b. Maymún, left Salamya in Syria, the centre from\r\nwhich the wires had hitherto been pulled, and crossing over to Africa\r\nappeared as the long-expected Mahdí under the name of ‘Ubaydu’lláh. He\r\ngave himself out to be a great-grandson of the Imám Muḥammad b.\r\nIsmá‘íl and therefore in the direct line of descent from ‘Alí b. Abí\r\nṬálib and Fáṭima the daughter of the Prophet. We need not stop to\r\ndiscuss this highly questionable genealogy from which the Fáṭimid\r\ndynasty derives its name. In 910 A.D. ‘Ubaydu’lláh entered Raqqáda in\r\ntriumph and assumed the title of Commander of the Faithful. Tunis, where\r\nthe Aghlabites had ruled since 800 A.D., was the cradle of Fáṭimid\r\npower, and here they built their capital, Mahdiyya, near the ancient\r\nThapsus. Gradually advancing eastward, they conquered Egypt and Syria as\r\nfar as Damascus (969-970 A.D.). At this time the seat of government was\r\nremoved to the newly-founded city of Cairo (_al-Qáhira_), which remained\r\nfor two centuries the metropolis of the Fáṭimid Empire.[505]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ayyúbids (1171-1250 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe Shí‘ite Anti-Caliphs maintained themselves in Egypt until 1171 A.D.,\r\nwhen the famous Saladin (Ṣaláḥu ’l-Dín b. Ayyúb) took possession\r\nof that country and restored the Sunnite faith. He soon added Syria to\r\nhis dominions, and \"the fall of Jerusalem (in 1187) roused Europe to\r\nundertake the Third Crusade.\" The Ayyúbids were strictly orthodox, as\r\nbehoved the champions of Islam against Christianity. They built and\r\nendowed many theological colleges. The Ṣúfí pantheist, Shihábu ’l-Dín\r\nYaḥyá al-Suhrawardí, was executed at Aleppo by order of Saladin's\r\nson, Malik al-Ẓáhir, in 1191 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seljúqs (1037-1300 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe two centuries preceding the extinction of the ‘Abbásid Caliphate by\r\nthe Mongols witnessed the rise and decline of the Seljúq Turks, who\r\n\"once more re-united Muḥammadan Asia from the western frontier of\r\nAfghanistan to the Mediterranean under one sovereign.\" Seljúq b. Tuqáq\r\nwas a Turcoman chief. Entering Transoxania, he settled near Bukhárá and\r\nwent over with his whole people to Islam. His descendants, Ṭughril\r\nBeg and Chagar Beg, invaded Khurásán, annexed the western provinces of\r\nthe Ghaznevid Empire, and finally absorbed the remaining dominions of\r\nthe Buwayhids. Baghdád was occupied by Ṭughril Beg in 1055 A.D. It\r\nhas been said that the Seljúqs contributed almost nothing to culture,\r\nbut this perhaps needs some qualification. Although Alp Arslán, who\r\nsucceeded Ṭughril, and his son Malik Sháh devoted their energies in\r\nthe first place to military affairs, the latter at least was an\r\naccomplished and enlightened monarch. \"He exerted himself to spread the\r\nbenefits of civilisation: he dug numerous canals, walled a great number\r\nof cities, built bridges, and constructed _ribáṭs_ in the desert\r\nplaces.\"[506] He was deeply interested in astronomy, and scientific as\r\nwell as theological studies received his patronage. Any shortcomings of\r\nAlp Arslán and Malik Sháh in this respect were amply repaired by their\r\nfamous minister, Ḥasan b. ‘Alí, the Niẓámu ’l-Mulk or 'Constable\r\nof the Empire,' to give him the title which he has made his own. Like so\r\nmany great Viziers, he was a Persian, and his achievements must not\r\ndetain us here, but it may be mentioned that he founded in Baghdád and\r\nNaysábúr the two celebrated academies which were called in his honour\r\nal-Niẓámiyya.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabia and Spain.]\r\n\r\nWe have now taken a general, though perforce an extremely curtailed and\r\ndisconnected, view of the political conditions which existed during the\r\n‘Abbásid period in most parts of the Muḥammadan Empire except Arabia\r\nand Spain. The motherland of Islam had long sunk to the level of a minor\r\nprovince: leaving the Holy Cities out of consideration, one might\r\ncompare its inglorious destiny under the Caliphate to that of Macedonia\r\nin the empire which Alexander bequeathed to his successors, the\r\nPtolemies and Seleucids. As regards the political history of Spain a few\r\nwords will conveniently be said in a subsequent chapter, where the\r\nliterature produced by Spanish Moslems will demand our attention. In the\r\nmeantime we shall pass on to the characteristic literary developments of\r\nthis period, which correspond more or less closely to the historical\r\noutlines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes the student of mediæval Arabic literature\r\nis the fact that a very large proportion of the leading writers are\r\nnon-Arabs, or at best semi-Arabs, men whose fathers or mothers were of\r\nforeign, and especially Persian, race. They wrote in Arabic, because\r\ndown to about 1000 A.D. that language was the sole medium of literary\r\nexpression in the Muḥammadan world, a monopoly which it retained in\r\nscientific compositions until the Mongol Invasion of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. I have already referred to the question whether such men as\r\nBashshár b. Burd, Abú Nuwás, Ibn Qutayba, Ṭabarí, Ghazálí, and\r\nhundreds of others should be included in a literary history of the\r\nArabs, and have given reasons, which I need not repeat in this place,\r\nfor considering their admission to be not only desirable but fully\r\njustified on logical grounds.[507] The absurdity of treating them as\r\nPersians--and there is no alternative, if they are not to be reckoned as\r\nArabs--appears to me self-evident.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange,\" says Ibn Khaldún, \"that most of the learned among the\r\nMoslems who have excelled in the religious or intellectual sciences are\r\nnon-Arabs (_‘Ajam_) with rare exceptions; and even those savants who\r\nclaimed Arabian descent spoke a foreign language, grew up in foreign\r\nlands, and studied under foreign masters, notwithstanding that the\r\ncommunity to which they belonged was Arabian and the author of its\r\nreligion an Arab.\" The historian proceeds to explain the cause of this\r\nsingular circumstance in an interesting passage which may be summarised\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ibn Khaldún's explanation of the fact that learning was\r\n  chiefly cultivated by the Persian Moslems.]\r\n\r\n  The first Moslems were entirely ignorant of art and science, all\r\n  their attention being devoted to the ordinances of the Koran, which\r\n  they \"carried in their breasts,\" and to the practice (_sunna_) of\r\n  the Prophet. At that time the Arabs knew nothing of the way by which\r\n  learning is taught, of the art of composing books, and of the means\r\n  whereby knowledge is enregistered. Those, however, who could repeat\r\n  the Koran and relate the Traditions of Muḥammad were called\r\n  Readers (_qurrá_). This oral transmission continued until the reign\r\n  of Hárún al-Rashíd, when the need of securing the Traditions against\r\n  corruption or of preventing their total loss caused them to be set\r\n  down in writing; and in order to distinguish the genuine Traditions\r\n  from the spurious, every _isnád_ (chain of witnesses) was carefully\r\n  scrutinised. Meanwhile the purity of the Arabic tongue had gradually\r\n  become impaired: hence arose the science of grammar; and the rapid\r\n  development of Law and Divinity brought it about that other\r\n  sciences, _e.g._, logic and dialectic, were professionally\r\n  cultivated in the great cities of the Muḥammadan Empire. The\r\n  inhabitants of these cities were chiefly Persians, freedmen and\r\n  tradesmen, who had been long accustomed to the arts of civilisation.\r\n  Accordingly the most eminent of the early grammarians,\r\n  traditionists, and scholastic theologians, as well as of those\r\n  learned in the principles of Law and in the interpretation of the\r\n  Koran, were Persians by race or education, and the saying of the\r\n  Prophet was verified--\"_If Knowledge were attached to the ends of\r\n  the sky, some amongst the Persians would have reached it._\" Amidst\r\n  all this intellectual activity the Arabs, who had recently emerged\r\n  from a nomadic life, found the exercise of military and\r\n  administrative command too engrossing to give them leisure for\r\n  literary avocations which have always been disdained by a ruling\r\n  caste. They left such studies to the Persians and the mixed race\r\n  (_al-muwalladún_), which sprang from intermarriage of the conquerors\r\n  with the conquered. They did not entirely look down upon the men of\r\n  learning but recognised their services--since after all it was Islam\r\n  and the sciences connected with Islam that profited thereby.[508]\r\n\r\nEven in the Umayyad period, as we have seen, the maxim that Knowledge is\r\nPower was strikingly illustrated by the immense social influence which\r\nPersian divines exerted in the Muḥammadan community.[509]\r\nNevertheless, true Arabs of the old type regarded these _Mawálí_ and\r\ntheir learning with undisguised contempt. To the great majority of\r\nArabs, who prided themselves on their noble lineage and were content to\r\nknow nothing beyond the glorious traditions of heathendom and the\r\nvirtues practised by their sires, all literary culture seemed petty and\r\ndegrading. Their overbearing attitude towards the _Mawálí_, which is\r\nadmirably depicted in the first part of Goldziher's _Muhammedanische\r\nStudien_, met with a vigorous response. Non-Arabs and Moslem pietists\r\nalike appealed to the highest authority--the Koran; and since they\r\nrequired a more definite and emphatic pronouncement than was forthcoming\r\nfrom that source, they put in the mouth of the Prophet sayings like\r\nthese: \"He that speaks Arabic is thereby an Arab\"; \"whoever of the\r\npeople of Persia accepts Islam is (as much an Arab as) one of Quraysh.\"\r\nThis doctrine made no impression upon the Arabian aristocracy, but with\r\nthe downfall of the Umayyads the political and social equality of the\r\n_Mawálí_ became an accomplished fact. Not that the Arabs were at all\r\ndisposed to abate their pretensions. They bitterly resented the favour\r\nwhich the foreigners enjoyed and the influence which they exercised. The\r\nnational indignation finds a voice in many poems of the early ‘Abbásid\r\nperiod, _e.g._:--\r\n\r\n \"See how the asses which they used to ride\r\n  They have unsaddled, and sleek mules bestride!\r\n  No longer kitchen-herbs they buy and sell,[510]\r\n  But in the palace and the court they dwell;\r\n  Against us Arabs full of rage and spleen,\r\n  Hating the Prophet and the Moslem's _dín_.\"[511]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Shu‘úbites.]\r\n\r\nThe side of the non-Arabs in this literary quarrel was vehemently\r\nespoused by a party who called themselves the Shu‘úbites\r\n(_al-Shu‘úbiyya_),[512] while their opponents gave them the name of\r\nLevellers (_Ahlu ’l-Taswiya_), because they contended for the equality\r\nof all Moslems without regard to distinctions of race. I must refer the\r\nreader who seeks information concerning the history of the movement to\r\nGoldziher's masterly study,[513] where the controversial methods adopted\r\nby the Shu‘úbites are set forth in ample detail. He shows how the bolder\r\nspirits among them, not satisfied with claiming an _equal_ position,\r\nargued that the Arabs were absolutely inferior to the Persians and other\r\npeoples. The question was hotly debated, and many eminent writers took\r\npart in the fray. On the Shu‘úbite side Abú ‘Ubayda, Bírúní, and\r\nḤamza of Iṣfahán deserve mention. Jáḥiẓ and Ibn Durayd\r\nwere the most notable defenders of their own Arabian nationality, but\r\nthe 'pro-Arabs' also included several men of Persian origin, such as Ibn\r\nQutayba, Baládhurí, and Zamakhsharí. The Shu‘úbites directed their\r\nattacks principally against the racial pride of the Arabs, who were fond\r\nof boasting that they were the noblest of all mankind and spoke the\r\npurest and richest language in the world. Consequently the Persian\r\ngenealogists and philologists lost no opportunity of bringing to light\r\nscandalous and discreditable circumstances connected with the history of\r\nthe Arab tribes or of particular families. Arabian poetry, especially\r\nthe vituperative pieces (_mathálib_), furnished abundant matter of this\r\nsort, which was adduced by the Shu‘úbites as convincing evidence that\r\nthe claims of the Arabs to superior nobility were absurd. At the same\r\ntime the national view as to the unique and incomparable excellence of\r\nthe Arabic language received some rude criticism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assimilation of Arabs and Persians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enthusiasm for learning in the early ‘Abbásid period.]\r\n\r\nSo acute and irreconcilable were the racial differences between Arabs\r\nand Persians that one is astonished to see how thoroughly the latter\r\nbecame Arabicised in the course of a few generations. As clients\r\naffiliated to an Arab tribe, they assumed Arabic names and sought to\r\ndisguise their foreign extraction by fair means or foul. Many provided\r\nthemselves with fictitious pedigrees, on the strength of which they\r\npassed for Arabs. Such a pretence could have deceived nobody if it had\r\nnot been supported by a complete assimilation in language, manners, and\r\neven to some extent in character. On the neutral ground of Muḥammadan\r\nscience animosities were laid aside, and men of both races laboured\r\nenthusiastically for the common cause. When at length, after a century\r\nof bloody strife and engrossing political agitation, the great majority\r\nof Moslems found themselves debarred from taking part in public affairs,\r\nit was only natural that thousands of ardent and ambitious souls should\r\nthrow their pent-up energies into the pursuit of wealth or learning. We\r\nare not concerned here with the marvellous development of trade under\r\nthe first ‘Abbásid Caliphs, of which Von Kremer has given a full and\r\nentertaining description in his _Culturgeschichte des Orients_. It may\r\nbe recalled, however, that many commercial terms, _e.g._, tariff, names\r\nof fabrics (muslin, tabby, &c.), occurring in English as well as in most\r\nEuropean languages are of Arabic origin and were brought to Europe by\r\nmerchants from Baghdád, Mosul, Baṣra, and other cities of Western\r\nAsia. This material expansion was accompanied by an outburst of\r\nintellectual activity such as the East had never witnessed before. It\r\nseemed as if all the world from the Caliph down to the humblest citizen\r\nsuddenly became students, or at least patrons, of literature. In quest\r\nof knowledge men travelled over three continents and returned home, like\r\nbees laden with honey, to impart the precious stores which they had\r\naccumulated to crowds of eager disciples, and to compile with incredible\r\nindustry those works of encyclopædic range and erudition from which\r\nmodern Science, in the widest sense of the word, has derived far more\r\nthan is generally supposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of the Moslem sciences.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution which made the fortune of the ‘Abbásid House was a\r\ntriumph for Islam and the party of religious reform. While under the\r\nworldly Umayyads the studies of Law and Tradition met with no public\r\nencouragement and were only kept alive by the pious zeal of oppressed\r\ntheologians, the new dynasty drew its strength from the Muḥammadan\r\nideas which it professed to establish, and skilfully adapted its policy\r\nto satisfying the ever-increasing claims of the Church. Accordingly the\r\nMoslem sciences which arose at this time proceeded in the first instance\r\nfrom the Koran and the Ḥadíth. The sacred books offered many\r\ndifficulties both to provincial Arabs and especially to Persians and\r\nother Moslems of foreign extraction. For their right understanding a\r\nknowledge of Arabic grammar and philology was essential, and this\r\ninvolved the study of the ancient Pre-islamic poems which supplied the\r\nmost authentic models of Arabian speech in its original purity. The\r\nstudy of these poems entailed researches into genealogy and history,\r\nwhich in the course of time became independent branches of learning.\r\nSimilarly the science of Tradition was systematically developed in order\r\nto provide Moslems with practical rules for the conduct of life in every\r\nconceivable particular, and various schools of Law sprang into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their classification.]\r\n\r\nMuḥammadan writers usually distinguish the sciences which are\r\nconnected with the Koran and those which the Arabs learned from foreign\r\npeoples. In the former class they include the Traditional or Religious\r\nSciences (_al-‘Ulúm al-Naqliyya awi ’l-Shar‘iyya_) and the Linguistic\r\nSciences (_‘Ulúmu ’l-Lisáni ’l-‘Arabí_); in the latter the Intellectual\r\nor Philosophical Sciences (_al-‘Ulúm al-‘Aqliyya awi ’l-Ḥikmiyya_),\r\nwhich are sometimes called 'The Sciences of the Foreigners' (_‘Ulúmu\r\n’l-‘Ajam_) or 'The Ancient Sciences' (_al-‘Ulúm al-Qadíma_).\r\n\r\nThe general scope of this division may be illustrated by the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n  I. THE NATIVE SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n  1. Koranic Exegesis (_‘Ilmu ’l-Tafsír_).\r\n  2. Koranic Criticism (_‘Ilmu ’l-Qirá’át_).\r\n  3. The Science of Apostolic Tradition (_‘Ilmu ’l-Ḥadíth_).\r\n  4. Jurisprudence (_Fiqh_).\r\n  5. Scholastic Theology (_‘Ilmu ’l-Kalám_).\r\n  6. Grammar (_Naḥw_).\r\n  7. Lexicography (_Lugha_).\r\n  8. Rhetoric (_Bayán_).\r\n  9. Literature (_Adab_).\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. THE FOREIGN SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n  1. Philosophy (_Falsafa_).[514]\r\n  2. Geometry (_Handasa_).[515]\r\n  3. Astronomy (_‘Ilmu ’l-Nujúm_).\r\n  4. Music (_Músíqí_).\r\n  5. Medicine (_Ṭibb_).\r\n  6. Magic and Alchemy (_al-Siḥr wa-’l-Kímiyá_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The early ‘Abbásid period favourable to free-thought.]\r\n\r\nThe religious phenomena of the Period will be discussed in a separate\r\nchapter, and here I can only allude cursorily to their general\r\ncharacter. We have seen that during the whole Umayyad epoch, except in\r\nthe brief reign of ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Azíz, the professors of religion\r\nwere out of sympathy with the court, and that many of them withdrew from\r\nall participation in public affairs. It was otherwise when the ‘Abbásids\r\nestablished themselves in power. Theology now dwelt in the shadow of the\r\nthrone and directed the policy of the Government. Honours were showered\r\non eminent jurists and divines, who frequently held official posts of\r\nhigh importance and stood in the most confidential and intimate\r\nrelations to the Caliph; a classical example is the friendship of the\r\nCadi Abú Yúsuf and Hárún al-Rashíd. The century after the Revolution\r\ngave birth to the four great schools of Muhammadan Law, which are still\r\ncalled by the names of their founders--Málik b. Anas, Abú Ḥanífa,\r\nSháfi‘í, and Ahmad b. Ḥanbal. At this time the scientific and\r\nintellectual movement had free play. The earlier Caliphs usually\r\nencouraged speculation so long as it threatened no danger to the\r\nexisting _régime_. Under Ma’mún and his successors the Mu‘tazilite\r\nRationalism became the State religion, and Islam seemed to have entered\r\nupon an era of enlightenment. Thus the first ‘Abbásid period (750-847\r\nA.D.) with its new learning and liberal theology may well be compared to\r\nthe European Renaissance; but in the words of a celebrated Persian\r\npoet--\r\n\r\n _Khil‘atí bas fákhir ámad ‘umr ‘aybash kútahíst._[516]\r\n\r\n \"Life is a very splendid robe: its fault is brevity.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The triumph of orthodoxy.]\r\n\r\nThe Caliph Mutawakkil (847-861 A.D.) signalised his accession by\r\ndeclaring the Mu‘tazilite doctrines to be heretical and by returning to\r\nthe traditional faith. Stern measures were taken against dissenters.\r\nHenceforth there was little room in Islam for independent thought. The\r\npopulace regarded philosophy and natural science as a species of\r\ninfidelity. Authors of works on these subjects ran a serious risk unless\r\nthey disguised their true opinions and brought the results of their\r\ninvestigations into apparent conformity with the text of the Koran.\r\nAbout the middle of the tenth century the reactionary spirit assumed a\r\ndogmatic shape in the system of Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-Ash‘arí, the father\r\nof Muḥammadan Scholasticism, which is essentially opposed to\r\nintellectual freedom and has maintained its petrifying influence almost\r\nunimpaired down to the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could wish that this chapter were more worthy of the title which I\r\nhave chosen for it, but the foregoing pages will have served their\r\npurpose if they have enabled my readers to form some idea of the\r\npolitics of the Period and of the broad features marking the course of\r\nits literary and religious history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPOETRY, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE IN THE ‘ABBÁSID PERIOD\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pre-islamic poets regarded as classical.]\r\n\r\nPre-Islamic poetry was the natural expression of nomad life. We might\r\ntherefore have expected that the new conditions and ideas introduced by\r\nIslam would rapidly work a corresponding revolution in the poetical\r\nliterature of the following century. Such, however, was far from being\r\nthe case. The Umayyad poets clung tenaciously to the great models of the\r\nHeroic Age and even took credit for their skilful imitation of the\r\nantique odes. The early Muḥammadan critics, who were philologists by\r\nprofession, held fast to the principle that Poetry in Pre-islamic times\r\nhad reached a perfection which no modern bard could hope to emulate, and\r\nwhich only the lost ideals of chivalry could inspire.[517] To have been\r\nborn after Islam was in itself a proof of poetical inferiority.[518]\r\nLinguistic considerations, of course, entered largely into this\r\nprejudice. The old poems were studied as repositories of the pure\r\nclassical tongue and were estimated mainly from a grammarian's\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú Nuwás as a critic.]\r\n\r\nThese ideas gained wide acceptance in literary circles and gradually\r\nbiassed the popular taste to such an extent that learned pedants could\r\nboast, like Khalíl b. Ahmad, the inventor of Arabic prosody, that it lay\r\nin their power to make or mar the reputation of a rising poet as they\r\ndeemed fit. Originality being condemned in advance, those who desired\r\nthe approval of this self-constituted Academy were obliged to waste\r\ntheir time and talents upon elaborate reproduction of the ancient\r\nmasterpieces, and to entertain courtiers and citizens with borrowed\r\npictures of Bedouin life in which neither they nor their audience took\r\nthe slightest interest. Some, it is true, recognised the absurdity of\r\nthe thing. Abú Nuwás († _circa_ 810 A.D.) often ridicules the custom, to\r\nwhich reference has been made elsewhere, of apostrophising the deserted\r\nencampment (_aṭlál_ or _ṭulúl_) in the opening lines of an ode,\r\nand pours contempt on the fashionable glorification of antiquity. In the\r\npassage translated below he gives a description of the desert and its\r\npeople which recalls some of Dr. Johnson's sallies at the expense of\r\nScotland and Scotsmen:--\r\n\r\n \"Let the south-wind moisten with rain the desolate scene\r\n  And Time efface what once was so fresh and green!\r\n  Make the camel-rider free of a desert space\r\n  Where high-bred camels trot with unwearied pace;\r\n  Where only mimosas and thistles flourish, and where,\r\n  For hunting, wolves and hyenas are nowise rare!\r\n  Amongst the Bedouins seek not enjoyment out:\r\n  What do they enjoy? They live in hunger and drought.\r\n  Let them drink their bowls of milk and leave them alone,\r\n  To whom life's finer pleasures are all unknown.\"[519]\r\n\r\nIbn Qutayba, who died towards the end of the ninth century A.D., was the\r\nfirst critic of importance to declare that ancients and moderns should\r\nbe judged on their merits without regard to their age. He writes as\r\nfollows in the Introduction to his 'Book of Poetry and Poets' (_Kitábu\r\n’l-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_):--[520]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ibn Qutayba on ancient and modern poets.]\r\n\r\n  \"In citing extracts from the works of the poets I have been guided\r\n  by my own choice and have refused to admire anything merely because\r\n  others thought it admirable. I have not regarded any ancient with\r\n  veneration on account of his antiquity nor any modern with contempt\r\n  on account of his being modern, but I have taken an impartial view\r\n  of both sides, giving every one his due and amply acknowledging his\r\n  merit. Some of our scholars, as I am aware, pronounce a feeble poem\r\n  to be good, because its author was an ancient, and include it among\r\n  their chosen pieces, while they call a sterling poem bad though its\r\n  only fault is that it was composed in their own time or that they\r\n  have seen its author. God, however, did not restrict learning and\r\n  poetry and rhetoric to a particular age nor appropriate them to a\r\n  particular class, but has always distributed them in common amongst\r\n  His servants, and has caused everything old to be new in its own day\r\n  and every classic work to be an upstart on its first appearance.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt against classicism.]\r\n\r\nThe inevitable reaction in favour of the new poetry and of contemporary\r\nliterature in general was hastened by various circumstances which\r\ncombined to overthrow the prevalent theory that Arabian heathendom and\r\nthe characteristic pagan virtues--honour, courage, liberality, &c.--were\r\nalone capable of producing poetical genius. Among the chief currents of\r\nthought tending in this direction, which are lucidly set forth in\r\nGoldziher's essay, pp. 148 sqq., we may note (_a_) the pietistic and\r\ntheological spirit fostered by the ‘Abbásid Government, and (_b_) the\r\ninfluence of foreign, pre-eminently Persian, culture. As to the former,\r\nit is manifest that devout Moslems would not be at all disposed to admit\r\nthe exclusive pretensions made on behalf of the _Jáhiliyya_ or to agree\r\nwith those who exalted chivalry (_muruwwa_) above religion (_dín_). Were\r\nnot the language and style of the Koran incomparably excellent? Surely\r\nthe Holy Book was a more proper subject for study than heathen verses.\r\nBut if Moslems began to call Pre-islamic ideals in question, it was\r\nespecially the Persian ascendancy resulting from the triumph of the\r\n‘Abbásid House that shook the old arrogant belief of the Arabs in the\r\nintellectual supremacy of their race. So far from glorying in the\r\ntraditions of paganism, many people thought it grossly insulting to\r\nmention an ‘Abbásid Caliph in the same breath with heroes of the past\r\nlike Ḥátim of Ṭayyi’ and Harim b. Sinán. The philosopher al-Kindí\r\n(† about 850 A.D.) rebuked a poet for venturing on such odious\r\ncomparisons. \"Who are these Arabian vagabonds\" (_ṣa‘álíku ’l-‘Arab_),\r\nhe asked, \"and what worth have they?\"[521]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Critics in favour of the modern school.]\r\n\r\nWhile Ibn Qutayba was content to urge that the modern poets should get a\r\nfair hearing, and should be judged not chronologically or\r\nphilologically, but _æsthetically_, some of the greatest literary\r\ncritics who came after him do not conceal their opinion that the new\r\npoetry is superior to the old. Tha‘álibí († 1038 A.D.) asserts that in\r\ntenderness and elegance the Pre-islamic bards are surpassed by their\r\nsuccessors, and that both alike have been eclipsed by his\r\ncontemporaries. Ibn Rashíq († _circa_ 1070 A.D.), whose _‘Umda_ on the\r\nArt of Poetry is described by Ibn Khaldún as an epoch-making work,\r\nthought that the superiority of the moderns would be acknowledged if\r\nthey discarded the obsolete conventions of the Ode. European readers\r\ncannot but sympathise with him when he bids the poets draw inspiration\r\nfrom nature and truth instead of relating imaginary journeys on a camel\r\nwhich they never owned, through deserts which they never saw, to a\r\npatron residing in the same city as themselves. This seems to us a very\r\nreasonable and necessary protest, but it must be remembered that the\r\nBedouin _qaṣída_ was not easily adaptable to the conditions of urban\r\nlife, and needed complete remoulding rather than modification in\r\ndetail.[522]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popularity of the modern poets.]\r\n\r\n\"In the fifth century,\" says Goldziher--_i.e._, from about 1000\r\nA.D.--\"the dogma of the unattainable perfection of the heathen poets may\r\nbe regarded as utterly demolished.\" Henceforth popular taste ran\r\nstrongly in the other direction, as is shown by the immense\r\npreponderance of modern pieces in the anthologies--a favourite and\r\ncharacteristic branch of Arabic literature--which were compiled during\r\nthe ‘Abbásid period and afterwards, and by frequent complaints of the\r\nneglect into which the ancient poetry had fallen. But although, for\r\nMoslems generally, Imru’u ’l-Qays and his fellows came to be more or\r\nless what Chaucer is to the average Englishman, the views first\r\nenunciated by Ibn Qutayba met with bitter opposition from the learned\r\nclass, many of whom clung obstinately to the old philological principles\r\nof criticism, and even declined to recognise the writings of Mutanabbí\r\nand Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí as poetry, on the ground that those authors\r\ndid not observe the classical 'types' (_asálíb_).[523] The result of\r\nsuch pedantry may be seen at the present day in thousands of\r\n_qaṣídas_, abounding in archaisms and allusions to forgotten far-off\r\nthings of merely antiquarian interest, but possessing no more claim to\r\nconsideration here than the Greek and Latin verses of British scholars\r\nin a literary history of the Victorian Age.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of the new poetry.]\r\n\r\nPassing now to the characteristics of the new poetry which followed the\r\naccession of the ‘Abbásids, we have to bear in mind that from first to\r\nlast (with very few exceptions) it flourished under the patronage of the\r\ncourt. There was no organised book trade, no wealthy publishers, so that\r\npoets were usually dependent for their livelihood on the capricious\r\nbounty of the Caliphs and his favourites whom they belauded. Huge sums\r\nwere paid for a successful panegyric, and the bards vied with each other\r\nin flattery of the most extravagant description. Even in writers of real\r\ngenius this prostitution of their art gave rise to a great deal of the\r\nfalse glitter and empty bombast which are often erroneously attributed\r\nto Oriental poetry as a whole.[524] These qualities, however, are\r\nabsolutely foreign to Arabian poetry of the best period. The old\r\nBedouins who praised a man only for that which was in him, and drew\r\ntheir images directly from nature, stand at the opposite pole to\r\nTha‘álibí's contemporaries. Under the Umayyads, as we have seen, little\r\nchange took place. It is not until after the enthronement of the\r\n‘Abbásids, when Persians filled the chief offices at court, and when a\r\ngoodly number of poets and eminent men of learning had Persian blood in\r\ntheir veins, that an unmistakably new note makes itself heard. One might\r\nbe tempted to surmise that the high-flown, bombastic, and ornate style\r\nof which Mutanabbí is the most illustrious exponent, and which is so\r\nmarked a feature in later Muḥammadan poetry, was first introduced by\r\nthe Persians and Perso-Arabs who gathered round the Caliph in Baghdád\r\nand celebrated the triumph of their own race in the person of a noble\r\nBarmecide; but this would scarcely be true. The style in question is not\r\nspecially Persian; the earliest Arabic-writing poets of Íránian descent,\r\nlike Bashshár b. Burd and Abú Nuwás, are (so far as I can see) without a\r\ntrace of it. What the Persians brought into Arabian poetry was not a\r\ngrandiose style, but a lively and graceful fancy, elegance of diction,\r\ndepth and tenderness of feeling, and a rich store of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe process of transformation was aided by other causes besides the\r\ninflux of Persian and Hellenistic culture: for example, by the growing\r\nimportance of Islam in public life and the diffusion of a strong\r\nreligious spirit among the community at large--a spirit which attained\r\nits most perfect expression in the reflective and didactic poetry of Abu\r\n’l-‘Atáhiya. Every change of many-coloured life is depicted in the\r\nbrilliant pages of these modern poets, where the reader may find,\r\naccording to his mood, the maddest gaiety and the shamefullest\r\nfrivolity; strains of lofty meditation mingled with a world-weary\r\npessimism; delicate sentiment, unforced pathos, and glowing rhetoric;\r\nbut seldom the manly self-reliance, the wild, invigorating freedom and\r\ninimitable freshness of Bedouin song.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Five typical poets of the ‘Abbásid period.]\r\n\r\nIt is of course impossible to do justice even to the principal ‘Abbásid\r\npoets within the limits of this chapter, but the following five may be\r\ntaken as fairly representative: Muṭí‘ b. Iyás, Abú Nuwás, Abu\r\n’l-‘Atáhiya, Mutanabbí, and Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí. The first three were\r\nin close touch with the court of Baghdád, while Mutanabbí and Abu\r\n’l-‘Alá flourished under the Ḥamdánid dynasty which ruled in Aleppo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muṭí‘ b. Iyás.]\r\n\r\nMuṭí‘ b. Iyás only deserves notice here as the earliest poet of the\r\nNew School. His father was a native of Palestine, but he himself was\r\nborn and educated at Kúfa. He began his career under the Umayyads, and\r\nwas devoted to the Caliph Walíd b. Yazíd, who found in him a fellow\r\nafter his own heart, \"accomplished, dissolute, an agreeable companion\r\nand excellent wit, reckless in his effrontery and suspected in his\r\nreligion.\"[525] When the ‘Abbásids came into power Muṭí‘ attached\r\nhimself to the Caliph Manṣúr. Many stories are told of the debauched\r\nlife which he led in the company of _zindíqs_, or freethinkers, a class\r\nof men whose opinions we shall sketch in another chapter. His songs of\r\nlove and wine are distinguished by their lightness and elegance. The\r\nbest known is that in which he laments his separation from the daughter\r\nof a _Dihqán_ (Persian landed proprietor), and invokes the two\r\npalm-trees of Ḥulwán, a town situated on the borders of the Jibál\r\nprovince between Hamadhán and Baghdád. From this poem arose the proverb,\r\n\"Faster friends than the two palm-trees of Ḥulwán.\"[526]\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE YEOMAN'S DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n \"O ye two palms, palms of Ḥulwán,\r\n  Help me weep Time's bitter dole!\r\n  Know that Time for ever parteth\r\n  Life from every living soul.\r\n\r\n  Had ye tasted parting's anguish,\r\n  Ye would weep as I, forlorn.\r\n  Help me! Soon must ye asunder\r\n  By the same hard fate be torn.\r\n\r\n  Many are the friends and loved ones\r\n  Whom I lost in days of yore.\r\n  Fare thee well, O yeoman's daughter!--\r\n  Never grief like this I bore.\r\n  Her, alas, mine eyes behold not,\r\n  And on me she looks no more!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú Nuwás († _circa_ 810 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nBy Europeans who know him only through the _Thousand and One Nights_ Abú\r\nNuwás is remembered as the boon-companion and court jester of \"the good\r\nHaroun Alraschid,\" and as the hero of countless droll adventures and\r\nfacetious anecdotes--an Oriental Howleglass or Joe Miller. It is often\r\nforgotten that he was a great poet who, in the opinion of those most\r\ncompetent to judge, takes rank above all his contemporaries and\r\nsuccessors, including even Mutanabbí, and is not surpassed in poetical\r\ngenius by any ancient bard.\r\n\r\nḤasan b. Háni’ gained the familiar title of Abú Nuwás (Father of the\r\nlock of hair) from two locks which hung down on his shoulders. He was\r\nborn of humble parents, about the middle of the eighth century, in\r\nAḥwáz, the capital of Khúzistán. That he was not a pure Arab the name\r\nof his mother, Jallabán, clearly indicates, while the following verse\r\naffords sufficient proof that he was not ashamed of his Persian blood:--\r\n\r\n \"Who are Tamím and Qays and all their kin?\r\n  The Arabs in God's sight are nobody.\"[527]\r\n\r\nHe received his education at Baṣra, of which city he calls himself a\r\nnative,[528] and at Kúfa, where he studied poetry and philology under\r\nthe learned Khalaf al-Aḥmar. After passing a 'Wanderjahr' among the\r\nArabs of the desert, as was the custom of scholars at that time, he made\r\nhis way to Baghdád and soon eclipsed every competitor at the court of\r\nHárún the Orthodox. A man of the most abandoned character, which he took\r\nno pains to conceal, Abú Nuwás, by his flagrant immorality, drunkenness,\r\nand blasphemy, excited the Caliph's anger to such a pitch that he often\r\nthreatened the culprit with death, and actually imprisoned him on\r\nseveral occasions; but these fits of severity were brief. The poet\r\nsurvived both Hárún and his son, Amín, who succeeded him in the\r\nCaliphate. Age brought repentance--\"the Devil was sick, the Devil a monk\r\nwould be.\" He addressed the following lines from prison to Faḍl b.\r\nal-Rabí‘, whom Hárún appointed Grand Vizier after the fall of the\r\nBarmecides:--\r\n\r\n \"Faḍl, who hast taught and trained me up to goodness\r\n  (And goodness is but habit), thee I praise.\r\n  Now hath vice fled and virtue me revisits,\r\n  And I have turned to chaste and pious ways.\r\n  To see me, thou would'st think the saintly Baṣrite,\r\n  Ḥasan, or else Qatáda, met thy gaze,[529]\r\n  So do I deck humility with leanness,\r\n  While yellow, locust-like, my cheek o'erlays.\r\n  Beads on my arm; and on my breast the Scripture,\r\n  Where hung a chain of gold in other days.\"[530]\r\n\r\nThe Díwán of Abú Nuwás contains poems in many different styles--_e.g._,\r\npanegyric (_madíḥ), satire (_hijá_), songs of the chase\r\n(ṭardiyyát_), elegies (_maráthí_), and religious poems (_zuhdiyyát_);\r\nbut love and wine were the two motives by which his genius was most\r\nbrilliantly inspired. His wine-songs (_khamriyyát_) are generally\r\nacknowledged to be incomparable. Here is one of the shortest:--\r\n\r\n \"Thou scolder of the grape and me,\r\n    I ne'er shall win thy smile!\r\n  Because against thee I rebel,\r\n    'Tis churlish to revile.\r\n\r\n  Ah, breathe no more the name of wine\r\n    Until thou cease to blame,\r\n  For fear that thy foul tongue should smirch\r\n    Its fair and lovely name!\r\n\r\n  Come, pour it out, ye gentle boys,\r\n    A vintage ten years old,\r\n  That seems as though 'twere in the cup\r\n    A lake of liquid gold.\r\n\r\n  And when the water mingles there,\r\n    To fancy's eye are set\r\n  Pearls over shining pearls close strung\r\n    As in a carcanet.\"[531]\r\n\r\nAnother poem begins--\r\n\r\n \"Ho! a cup, and fill it up, and tell me it is wine,\r\n  For I will never drink in shade if I can drink in shine!\r\n  Curst and poor is every hour that sober I must go,\r\n  But rich am I whene'er well drunk I stagger to and fro.\r\n  Speak, for shame, the loved one's name, let vain disguise alone:\r\n  No good there is in pleasures o'er which a veil is thrown.\"[532]\r\n\r\nAbú Nuwás practised what he preached, and hypocrisy at any rate cannot\r\nbe laid to his charge. The moral and religious sentiments which appear\r\nin some of his poems are not mere cant, but should rather be regarded as\r\nthe utterance of sincere though transient emotion. Usually he felt and\r\navowed that pleasure was the supreme business of his life, and that\r\nreligious scruples could not be permitted to stand in the way. He even\r\nurges others not to shrink from any excess, inasmuch as the Divine mercy\r\nis greater than all the sins of which a man is capable:--\r\n\r\n \"Accumulate as many sins thou canst:\r\n  The Lord is ready to relax His ire.\r\n  When the day comes, forgiveness thou wilt find\r\n  Before a mighty King and gracious Sire,\r\n  And gnaw thy fingers, all that joy regretting\r\n  Which thou didst leave thro' terror of Hell-fire!\"[533]\r\n\r\nWe must now bid farewell to Abú Nuwás and the licentious poets\r\n(_al-shu‘ará al-mujján_) who reflect so admirably the ideas and manners\r\nprevailing in court circles and in the upper classes of society which\r\nwere chiefly influenced by the court. The scenes of luxurious\r\ndissipation and refined debauchery which they describe show us, indeed,\r\nthat Persian culture was not an unalloyed blessing to the Arabs any more\r\nthan were the arts of Greece to the Romans; but this is only the darker\r\nside of the picture. The works of a contemporary poet furnish evidence\r\nof the indignation which the libertinism fashionable in high places\r\ncalled forth among the mass of Moslems who had not lost faith in\r\nmorality and religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya (748-828 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Atáhiya, unlike his great rival, came of Arab stock. He was bred\r\nin Kúfa, and gained his livelihood as a young man by selling\r\nearthenware. His poetical talent, however, promised so well that he set\r\nout to present himself before the Caliph Mahdí, who richly rewarded him;\r\nand Hárún al-Rashíd afterwards bestowed on him a yearly pension of\r\n50,000 dirhems (about £2,000), in addition to numerous\r\nextraordinary gifts. At Baghdád he fell in love with ‘Utba, a slave-girl\r\nbelonging to Mahdí, but she did not return his passion or take any\r\nnotice of the poems in which he celebrated her charms and bewailed the\r\nsufferings that she made him endure. Despair of winning her affection\r\ncaused him, it is said, to assume the woollen garb of Muḥammadan\r\nascetics,[534] and henceforth, instead of writing vain and amatorious\r\nverses, he devoted his powers exclusively to those joyless meditations\r\non mortality which have struck a deep chord in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen. Like Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí and others who neglected the\r\npositive precepts of Islam in favour of a moral philosophy based on\r\nexperience and reflection, Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya was accused of being a\r\nfreethinker (_zindíq_).[535] It was alleged that in his poems he often\r\nspoke of death but never of the Resurrection and the Judgment--a calumny\r\nwhich is refuted by many passages in his Díwán. According to the\r\nliterary historian al-Ṣúlí († 946 A.D.), Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya believed in\r\nOne God who formed the universe out of two opposite elements which He\r\ncreated from nothing; and held, further, that everything would be\r\nreduced to these same elements before the final destruction of all\r\nphenomena. Knowledge, he thought, was acquired naturally (_i.e._,\r\nwithout Divine Revelation) by means of reflection, deduction, and\r\nresearch.[536] He believed in the threatened retribution (_al-wa‘íd_)\r\nand in the command to abstain from commerce with the world (_taḥrímu\r\n’l-makásib_).[537] He professed the opinions of the Butrites,[538] a\r\nsubdivision of the Zaydites, as that sect of the Shí‘a was named which\r\nfollowed Zayd b. Alí b. Ḥusayn b. ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib. He spoke evil\r\nof none, and did not approve of revolt against the Government. He held\r\nthe doctrine of predestination (_jabr_).[539]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Atáhiya may have secretly cherished the Manichæan views ascribed\r\nto him in this passage, but his poems contain little or nothing that\r\ncould offend the most orthodox Moslem. The following verse, in which\r\nGoldziher finds an allusion to Buddha,[540] is capable of a different\r\ninterpretation. It rather seems to me to exalt the man of ascetic life,\r\nwithout particular reference to any individual, above all others:--\r\n\r\n \"If thou would'st see the noblest of mankind,\r\n  Behold a monarch in a beggar's garb.\"[541]\r\n\r\nBut while the poet avoids positive heresy, it is none the less true that\r\nmuch of his Díwán is not strictly religious in the Muḥammadan sense and\r\nmay fairly be called 'philosophical.' This was enough to convict him of\r\ninfidelity and atheism in the eyes of devout theologians who looked\r\naskance on moral teaching, however pure, that was not cast in the\r\ndogmatic mould. The pretended cause of his imprisonment by Hárún\r\nal-Rashíd--namely, that he refused to make any more love-songs--is\r\nprobably, as Goldziher has suggested, a popular version of the fact that\r\nhe persisted in writing religious poems which were supposed to have a\r\ndangerous bias in the direction of free-thought.\r\n\r\nHis poetry breathes a spirit of profound melancholy and hopeless\r\npessimism. Death and what comes after death, the frailty and misery of\r\nman, the vanity of worldly pleasures and the duty of renouncing\r\nthem--these are the subjects on which he dwells with monotonous\r\nreiteration, exhorting his readers to live the ascetic life and fear God\r\nand lay up a store of good works against the Day of Reckoning. The\r\nsimplicity, ease, and naturalness of his style are justly admired.\r\nReligious poetry, as he himself confesses, was not read at court or by\r\nscholars who demanded rare and obscure expressions, but only by pious\r\nfolk, traditionists and divines, and especially by the vulgar, \"who like\r\nbest what they can understand.\"[542] Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya wrote for 'the man\r\nin the street.' Discarding conventional themes tricked out with\r\nthreadbare artifices, he appealed to common feelings and matters of\r\nuniversal experience. He showed for the first and perhaps for the last\r\ntime in the history of classical Arabic literature that it was possible\r\nto use perfectly plain and ordinary language without ceasing to be a\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as has been said, the bulk of Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya's poetry is\r\nphilosophical in character, there remains much specifically Islamic\r\ndoctrine, in particular as regards the Resurrection and the Future Life.\r\nThis combination may be illustrated by the following ode, which is\r\nconsidered one of the best that have been written on the subject of\r\nreligion, or, more accurately, of asceticism (_zuhd_):--\r\n\r\n \"Get sons for death, build houses for decay!\r\n  All, all, ye wend annihilation's way.\r\n  For whom build we, who must ourselves return\r\n  Into our native element of clay?\r\n  O Death, nor violence nor flattery thou\r\n  Dost use, but when thou com'st, escape none may.\r\n  Methinks, thou art ready to surprise mine age,\r\n  As age surprised and made my youth his prey.\r\n  What ails me, World, that every place perforce\r\n  I lodge thee in, it galleth me to stay?\r\n  And, O Time, how do I behold thee run\r\n  To spoil me? Thine own gift thou tak'st away!\r\n  O Time! inconstant, mutable art thou,\r\n  And o'er the realm of ruin is thy sway.\r\n  What ails me that no glad result it brings\r\n  Whene'er, O World, to milk thee I essay?\r\n  And when I court thee, why dost thou raise up\r\n  On all sides only trouble and dismay?\r\n  Men seek thee every wise, but thou art like\r\n  A dream; the shadow of a cloud; the day\r\n  Which hath but now departed, nevermore\r\n  To dawn again; a glittering vapour gay.\r\n  This people thou hast paid in full: their feet\r\n  Are on the stirrup--let them not delay!\r\n  But those that do good works and labour well\r\n  Hereafter shall receive the promised pay.\r\n  As if no punishment I had to fear,\r\n  A load of sin upon my neck I lay;\r\n  And while the world I love, from Truth, alas,\r\n  Still my besotted senses go astray.\r\n  I shall be asked of all my business here:\r\n  What can I plead then? What can I gainsay?\r\n  What argument allege, when I am called\r\n  To render an account on Reckoning-Day?\r\n  Dooms twain in that dread hour shall be revealed,\r\n  When I the scroll of these mine acts survey:\r\n  Either to dwell in everlasting bliss,\r\n  Or suffer torments of the damned for aye!\"[543]\r\n\r\nI will now add a few verses culled from the Díwán which bring the poet's\r\npessimistic view of life into clearer outline, and also some examples of\r\nthose moral precepts and sententious criticisms which crowd his pages\r\nand have contributed in no small degree to his popularity.\r\n\r\n \"The world is like a viper soft to touch that venom spits.\"[544]\r\n\r\n \"Men sit like revellers o'er their cups and drink,\r\n  From the world's hand, the circling wine of death.\"[545]\r\n\r\n \"Call no man living blest for aught you see\r\n  But that for which you blessed call the dead.\"[546]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FALSE FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n \"'Tis not the Age that moves my scorn,\r\n  But those who in the Age are born.\r\n  I cannot count the friends that broke\r\n  Their faith, tho' honied words they spoke;\r\n  In whom no aid I found, and made\r\n  The Devil welcome to their aid.\r\n  May I--so best we shall agree--\r\n  Ne'er look on them nor they on me!\"[547]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"If men should see a prophet begging, they would turn and scout him.\r\n  Thy friend is ever thine as long as thou canst do without him;\r\n  But he will spew thee forth, if in thy need thou come about him.\"[548]\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WICKED WORLD.\r\n\r\n \"'Tis only on the culprit sin recoils,\r\n  The ignorant fool against himself is armed.\r\n  Humanity are sunk in wickedness;\r\n  The best is he that leaveth us unharmed.\"[549]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"'Twas my despair of Man that gave me hope\r\n  God's grace would find me soon, I know not how.\"[550]\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIFE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n \"Man's life is his fair name, and not his length of years;\r\n  Man's death is his ill-fame, and not the day that nears.\r\n  Then life to thy fair name by deeds of goodness give:\r\n  So in this world two lives, O mortal, thou shalt live.\"[551]\r\n\r\n\r\n  MAXIMS AND RULES OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n \"Mere falsehood by its face is recognised,\r\n  But Truth by parables and admonitions.\"[552]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"I keep the bond of love inviolate\r\n  Towards all humankind, for I betray\r\n  Myself, if I am false to any man.\"[553]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Far from the safe path, hop'st thou to be saved?\r\n  Ships make no speedy voyage on dry land.\"[554]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Strip off the world from thee and naked live,\r\n  For naked thou didst fall into the world.\"[555]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Man guards his own and grasps his neighbours' pelf,\r\n  And he is angered when they him prevent;\r\n  But he that makes the earth his couch will sleep\r\n  No worse, if lacking silk he have content.\"[556]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Men vaunt their noble blood, but I behold\r\n  No lineage that can vie with righteous deeds.\"[557]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"If knowledge lies in long experience,\r\n  Less than what I have borne suffices me.\"[558]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Faith is the medicine of every grief,\r\n  Doubt only raises up a host of cares.\"[559]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Blame me or no, 'tis my predestined state:\r\n  If I have erred, infallible is Fate.\"[560]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Atáhiya found little favour with his contemporaries, who seem to\r\nhave regarded him as a miserly hypocrite. He died, an aged man, in the\r\nCaliphate of Ma’mún.[561] Von Kremer thinks that he had a truer genius\r\nfor poetry than Abú Nuwás, an opinion in which I am unable to concur.\r\nBoth, however, as he points out, are distinctive types of their time. If\r\nAbú Nuwás presents an appalling picture of a corrupt and frivolous\r\nsociety devoted to pleasure, we learn from Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya something of\r\nthe religious feelings and beliefs which pervaded the middle and lower\r\nclasses, and which led them to take a more earnest and elevated view of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the rapid decline and disintegration of the ‘Abbásid Empire which\r\nset in towards the middle of the ninth century, numerous petty dynasties\r\narose, and the hitherto unrivalled splendour of Baghdád was challenged\r\nby more than one provincial court. These independent or semi-independent\r\nprinces were sometimes zealous patrons of learning--it is well known,\r\nfor example, that a national Persian literature first came into being\r\nunder the auspices of the Sámánids in Khurásán and the Buwayhids in\r\n‘Iráq--but as a rule the anxious task of maintaining, or the ambition of\r\nextending, their power left them small leisure to cultivate letters,\r\neven if they wished to do so. None combined the arts of war and peace\r\nmore brilliantly than the Ḥamdánid Sayfu ’l-Dawla, who in 944 A.D. made\r\nhimself master of Aleppo, and founded an independent kingdom in Northern\r\nSyria.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Tha‘álibí's eulogy of Sayfu ’l-Dawla.]\r\n\r\n  \"The Ḥamdánids,\" says Tha‘álibí, \"were kings and princes, comely of\r\n  countenance and eloquent of tongue, endowed with open-handedness and\r\n  gravity of mind. Sayfu ’l-Dawla is famed as the chief amongst them\r\n  all and the centre-pearl of their necklace. He was--may God be\r\n  pleased with him and grant his desires and make Paradise his\r\n  abode!--the brightest star of his age and the pillar of Islam: by\r\n  him the frontiers were guarded and the State well governed. His\r\n  attacks on the rebellious Arabs checked their fury and blunted their\r\n  teeth and tamed their stubbornness and secured his subjects against\r\n  their barbarity. His campaigns exacted vengeance from the Emperor of\r\n  the Greeks, decisively broke their hostile onset, and had an\r\n  excellent effect on Islam. His court was the goal of ambassadors,\r\n  the dayspring of liberality, the horizon-point of hope, the end of\r\n  journeys, a place where savants assembled and poets competed for the\r\n  palm. It is said that after the Caliphs no prince gathered around\r\n  him so many masters of poetry and men illustrious in literature as\r\n  he did; and to a monarch's hall, as to a market, people bring only\r\n  what is in demand. He was an accomplished scholar, a poet himself\r\n  and a lover of fine poetry; keenly susceptible to words of\r\n  praise.\"[562]\r\n\r\nSayfu ’l-Dawla's cousin, Abú Firás al-Ḥamdání, was a gallant soldier\r\nand a poet of some mark, who if space permitted would receive fuller\r\nnotice here.[563] He, however, though superior to the common herd of\r\ncourt poets, is overshadowed by one who with all his faults--and they\r\nare not inconsiderable--made an extraordinary impression upon his\r\ncontemporaries, and by the commanding influence of his reputation\r\ndecided what should henceforth be the standard of poetical taste in the\r\nMuḥammadan world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mutanabbí (915-965 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-Ṭayyib Ahmad b. Ḥusayn, known to fame as al-Mutanabbí, was\r\nborn and bred at Kúfa, where his father is said to have been a\r\nwater-carrier. Following the admirable custom by which young men of\r\npromise were sent abroad to complete their education, he studied at\r\nDamascus and visited other towns in Syria, but also passed much of his\r\ntime among the Bedouins, to whom he owed the singular knowledge and\r\nmastery of Arabic displayed in his poems. Here he came forward as a\r\nprophet (from which circumstance he was afterwards entitled\r\nal-Mutanabbí, _i.e._, 'the pretender to prophecy'), and induced a great\r\nmultitude to believe in him; but ere long he was captured by Lu’lu’, the\r\ngovernor of Ḥims (Emessa), and thrown into prison. After his release\r\nhe wandered to and fro chanting the praises of all and sundry, until\r\nfortune guided him to the court of Sayfu ’l-Dawla at Aleppo. For nine\r\nyears (948-957 A.D.) he stood high in the favour of that cultured\r\nprince, whose virtues he celebrated in a series of splendid eulogies,\r\nand with whom he lived as an intimate friend and comrade in arms. The\r\nliberality of Sayfu ’l-Dawla and the ingenious impudence of the poet are\r\nwell brought out by the following anecdote:--\r\n\r\n  Mutanabbí on one occasion handed to his patron the copy of an ode\r\n  which he had recently composed in his honour, and retired, leaving\r\n  Sayfu ’l-Dawla to peruse it at leisure. The prince began to read,\r\n  and came to these lines--\r\n\r\n    _Aqil anil aqṭi‘ iḥmil ‘alli salli a‘id\r\n     zid hashshi bashshi tafaḍḍal adni surra ṣili._[564]\r\n\r\n   \"_Pardon, bestow, endow, mount, raise, console, restore,\r\n     Add, laugh, rejoice, bring nigh, show favour, gladden, give!_\"\r\n\r\n  Far from being displeased by the poet's arrogance, Sayfu ’l-Dawla\r\n  was so charmed with his artful collocation of fourteen imperatives\r\n  in a single verse that he granted every request. Under _pardon_ he\r\n  wrote 'we pardon thee'; under _bestow_, 'let him receive such and\r\n  such a sum of money'; under _endow_, 'we endow thee with an estate,'\r\n  which he named (it was beside the gate of Aleppo); under _mount_,\r\n  'let such and such a horse be led to him'; under _raise_, 'we do\r\n  so'; under _console_, 'we do so, be at ease'; under _restore_, 'we\r\n  restore thee to thy former place in our esteem'; under _add_, 'let\r\n  him have such and such in addition'; under _bring nigh_, 'we admit\r\n  thee to our intimacy'; under _show favour_, 'we have done so'; under\r\n  _gladden_, 'we have made thee glad'[565]; under _give_, 'this we\r\n  have already done.' Mutanabbí's rivals envied his good fortune, and\r\n  one of them said to Sayfu ’l-Dawla--\"Sire, you have done all that\r\n  he asked, but when he uttered the words _laugh_, _rejoice_, why did\r\n  not you answer, 'Ha, ha, ha'?\" Sayfu ’l-Dawla laughed, and said,\r\n  \"You too, shall have your wish,\" and ordered him a donation.\r\n\r\nMutanabbí was sincerely attached to his generous master, and this\r\nfeeling inspired a purer and loftier strain than we find in the fulsome\r\npanegyrics which he afterwards addressed to the negro Káfúr. He seems to\r\nhave been occasionally in disgrace, but Sayfu ’l-Dawla could deny\r\nnothing to a poet who paid him such magnificent compliments. Nor was he\r\ndeterred by any false modesty from praising himself: he was fully\r\nconscious of his power and, like Arabian bards in general, he bragged\r\nabout it. Although the verbal legerdemain which is so conspicuous in his\r\npoetry cannot be reproduced in another language, the lines translated\r\nbelow may be taken as a favourable and sufficiently characteristic\r\nspecimen of his style.\r\n\r\n \"How glows mine heart for him whose heart to me is cold,\r\n  Who liketh ill my case and me in fault doth hold!\r\n  Why should I hide a love that hath worn thin my frame?\r\n  To Sayfu ’l-Dawla all the world avows the same.\r\n  Tho' love of his high star unites us, would that we\r\n  According to our love might so divide the fee!\r\n  Him have I visited when sword in sheath was laid,\r\n  And I have seen him when in blood swam every blade:\r\n  Him, both in peace and war the best of all mankind,\r\n  Whose crown of excellence was still his noble mind.\r\n\r\n  Do foes by flight escape thine onset, thou dost gain\r\n  A chequered victory, half of pleasure, half of pain.\r\n  So puissant is the fear thou strik'st them with, it stands\r\n  Instead of thee, and works more than thy warriors' hands.\r\n  Unfought the field is thine: thou need'st not further strain\r\n  To chase them from their holes in mountain or in plain.\r\n  What! 'fore thy fierce attack whene'er an army reels,\r\n  Must thy ambitious soul press hot upon their heels?\r\n  Thy task it is to rout them on the battle-ground;\r\n  No shame to thee if they in flight have safety found.\r\n  Or thinkest thou perchance that victory is sweet\r\n  Only when scimitars and necks each other greet?\r\n\r\n  O justest of the just save in thy deeds to me!\r\n  _Thou_ art accused and thou, O Sire, must judge the plea.\r\n  Look, I implore thee, well! Let not thine eye cajoled\r\n  See fat in empty froth, in all that glisters gold![566]\r\n  What use and profit reaps a mortal of his sight,\r\n  If darkness unto him be indistinct from light?\r\n\r\n  My deep poetic art the blind have eyes to see,\r\n  My verses ring in ears as deaf as deaf can be.\r\n  They wander far abroad while I am unaware,\r\n  But men collect them watchfully with toil and care.\r\n  Oft hath my laughing mien prolonged the insulter's sport,\r\n  Until with claw and mouth I cut his rudeness short.\r\n  Ah, when the lion bares his teeth, suspect his guile,\r\n  Nor fancy that the lion shows to you a smile.\r\n  I have slain the man that sought my heart's blood many a time,\r\n  Riding a noble mare whose back none else may climb,\r\n  Whose hind and fore-legs seem in galloping as one;\r\n  Nor hand nor foot requireth she to urge her on.\r\n  And O the days when I have swung my fine-edged glaive\r\n  Amidst a sea of death where wave was dashed on wave!\r\n  The desert knows me well, the night, the mounted men,\r\n  The battle and the sword, the paper and the pen!\"[567]\r\n\r\nFinally an estrangement arose between Mutanabbí and Sayfu ’l-Dawla, in\r\nconsequence of which he fled to Egypt and attached himself to the\r\nIkhshídite Káfúr. Disappointed in his new patron, a negro who had\r\nformerly been a slave, the poet set off for Baghdád, and afterwards\r\nvisited the court of the Buwayhid ‘Aḍudu ’l-Dawla at Shíráz. While\r\ntravelling through Babylonia he was attacked and slain by brigands in\r\n965 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Mutanabbí is shown by the numerous commentaries[568]\r\nand critical treatises on his _Díwán_. By his countrymen he is generally\r\nregarded as one of the greatest of Arabian poets, while not a few would\r\nmaintain that he ranks absolutely first. Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí, himself\r\nan illustrious poet and man of letters, confessed that he had sometimes\r\nwished to alter a word here and there in Mutanabbí's verses, but had\r\nnever been able to think of any improvement. \"As to his poetry,\" says\r\nIbn Khallikán, \"it is perfection.\" European scholars, with the exception\r\nof Von Hammer,[569] have been far from sharing this enthusiasm, as may\r\nbe seen by referring to what has been said on the subject by\r\nReiske,[570] De Sacy,[571] Bohlen,[572] Brockelmann,[573] and others. No\r\ndoubt, according to our canons of taste, Mutanabbí stands immeasurably\r\nbelow the famous Pre-islamic bards, and in a later age must yield the\r\npalm to Abú Nuwás and Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya. Lovers of poetry, as the term is\r\nunderstood in Europe, cannot derive much æsthetic pleasure from his\r\nwritings, but, on the contrary, will be disgusted by the beauties hardly\r\nless than by the faults which Arabian critics attribute to him.\r\nAdmitting, however, that only a born Oriental is able to appreciate\r\nMutanabbí at his full worth, let us try to realise the Oriental point of\r\nview and put aside, as far as possible, our preconceptions of what\r\nconstitutes good poetry and good taste. Fortunately we possess abundant\r\nmaterials for such an attempt in the invaluable work of Tha‘álibí, which\r\nhas been already mentioned.[574] Tha‘álibí (961-1038 A.D.) was nearly\r\ncontemporary with Mutanabbí. He began to write his _Yatíma_ about thirty\r\nyears after the poet's death, and while he bears witness to the\r\nunrivalled popularity of the _Díwán_ amongst all classes of society, he\r\nobserves that it was sharply criticised as well as rapturously admired.\r\nTha‘álibí himself claims to hold the balance even. \"Now,\" he says, \"I\r\nwill mention the faults and blemishes which critics have found in the\r\npoetry of Mutanabbí; for is there any one whose qualities give entire\r\nsatisfaction?--\r\n\r\n _Kafa ’l-mar’a faḍlan an tu‘adda ma‘áyibuh._\r\n\r\n 'Tis the height of merit in a man that his faults can be numbered.\r\n\r\nThen I will proceed to speak of his beauties and to set forth in due\r\norder the original and incomparable characteristics of his style.\r\n\r\n  The radiant stars with beauty strike our eyes\r\n  Because midst gloom opaque we see them rise.\"\r\n\r\nIt was deemed of capital importance that the opening couplet\r\n(_maṭla‘_) of a poem should be perfect in form and meaning, and that\r\nit should not contain anything likely to offend. Tha‘álibí brings\r\nforward many instances in which Mutanabbí has violated this rule by\r\nusing words of bad omen, such as 'sickness' or 'death,' or technical\r\nterms of music and arithmetic which only perplex and irritate the hearer\r\ninstead of winning his sympathy at the outset. He complains also that\r\nMutanabbí's finest thoughts and images are too often followed by low and\r\ntrivial ones: \"he strings pearls and bricks together\" (_jama‘a bayna\r\n’l-durrati wa-’l-ájurrati_). \"While he moulds the most splendid\r\nornament, and threads the loveliest necklace, and weaves the most\r\nexquisite stuff of mingled hues, and paces superbly in a garden of\r\nroses, suddenly he will throw in a verse or two verses disfigured by\r\nfar-fetched metaphors, or by obscure language and confused thought, or\r\nby extravagant affectation and excessive profundity, or by unbounded and\r\nabsurd exaggeration, or by vulgar and commonplace diction, or by\r\npedantry and grotesqueness resulting from the use of unfamiliar words.\"\r\nWe need not follow Tha‘álibí in his illustration of these and other\r\nweaknesses with which he justly reproaches Mutanabbí, since we shall be\r\nable to form a better idea of the prevailing taste from those points\r\nwhich he singles out for special praise.\r\n\r\nIn the first place he calls attention to the poet's skill in handling\r\nthe customary erotic prelude (_nasíb_), and particularly to his\r\nbrilliant descriptions of Bedouin women, which were celebrated all over\r\nthe East. As an example of this kind he quotes the following piece,\r\nwhich \"is chanted in the salons on account of the extreme beauty of its\r\ndiction, the choiceness of its sentiment, and the perfection of its\r\nart\":--\r\n\r\n \"Shame hitherto was wont my tears to stay,\r\n  But now by shame they will no more be stayed,\r\n  So that each bone seems through its skin to sob,\r\n  And every vein to swell the sad cascade.\r\n  She uncovered: pallor veiled her at farewell:\r\n  No veil 'twas, yet her cheeks it cast in shade.\r\n  So seemed they, while tears trickled over them,\r\n  Gold with a double row of pearls inlaid.\r\n  She loosed three sable tresses of her hair,\r\n  And thus of night four nights at once she made;\r\n  But when she lifted to the moon in heaven\r\n  Her face, two moons together I surveyed.\"[575]\r\n\r\nThe critic then enumerates various beautiful and original features of\r\nMutanabbí's style, _e.g._--\r\n\r\n1. His consecutive arrangement of similes in brief symmetrical clauses,\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n \"She shone forth like a moon, and swayed like a moringa-bough,\r\n  And shed fragrance like ambergris, and gazed like a gazelle.\"\r\n\r\n2. The novelty of his comparisons and images, as when he indicates the\r\nrapidity with which he returned to his patron and the shortness of his\r\nabsence in these lines:--\r\n\r\n \"I was merely an arrow in the air,\r\n  Which falls back, finding no refuge there.\"\r\n\r\n3. The _laus duplex_ or 'two-sided panegyric' (_al-madḥ, al-muwajjah_), which may be compared to a garment\r\nhaving two surfaces of different colours but of equal beauty, as in the\r\nfollowing verse addressed to Sayfu ’l-Dawla:--\r\n\r\n \"Were all the lives thou hast ta'en possessed by thee,\r\n  Immortal thou and blest the world would be!\"\r\n\r\nHere Sayfu ’l-Dawla is doubly eulogised by the mention of his triumphs\r\nover his enemies as well as of the joy which all his friends felt in the\r\ncontinuance of his life and fortune.\r\n\r\n4. His manner of extolling his royal patron as though he were speaking\r\nto a friend and comrade, whereby he raises himself from the position of\r\nan ordinary encomiast to the same level with kings.\r\n\r\n5. His division of ideas into parallel sentences:--\r\n\r\n \"We were in gladness, the Greeks in fear,\r\n  The land in bustle, the sea in confusion.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this summary of Tha‘álibí's criticism the reader will easily\r\nperceive that the chief merits of poetry were then considered to lie in\r\nelegant expression, subtle combination of words, fanciful imagery, witty\r\nconceits, and a striking use of rhetorical figures. Such, indeed, are\r\nthe views which prevail to this day throughout the whole Muḥammadan\r\nworld, and it is unreasonable to denounce them as false simply because\r\nthey do not square with ours. Who shall decide when nations disagree? If\r\nEnglishmen rightly claim to be the best judges of Shakespeare, and\r\nItalians of Dante, the almost unanimous verdict of Mutanabbí's\r\ncountrymen is surely not less authoritative--a verdict which places him\r\nat the head of all the poets born or made in Islam. And although the\r\npeculiar excellences indicated by Tha‘álibí do not appeal to us, there\r\nare few poets that leave so distinct an impression of greatness. One\r\nmight call Mutanabbí the Victor Hugo of the East, for he has the grand\r\nstyle whether he soars to sublimity or sinks to fustian. In the\r\nmasculine vigour of his verse, in the sweep and splendour of his\r\nrhetoric, in the luxuriance and reckless audacity of his imagination we\r\nrecognise qualities which inspired the oft-quoted lines of the\r\nelegist:--\r\n\r\n \"Him did his mighty soul supply\r\n  With regal pomp and majesty.\r\n  A Prophet by his _diction_ known;\r\n  But in the _ideas_, all must own,\r\n  His miracles were clearly shown.\"[576]\r\n\r\nOne feature of Mutanabbí's poetry that is praised by Tha‘álibí should\r\nnot be left unnoticed, namely, his fondness for sententious moralising\r\non topics connected with human life; wherefore Reiske has compared him\r\nto Euripides. He is allowed to be a master of that proverbial philosophy\r\nin which Orientals delight and which is characteristic of the modern\r\nschool beginning with Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya, though some of the ancients had\r\nalready cultivated it with success (cf. the verses of Zuhayr, p. 118\r\n_supra_). The following examples are among those cited by Bohlen (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 86 sqq.):--\r\n\r\n \"When an old man cries 'Ugh!' he is not tired\r\n  Of life, but only tired of feebleness.\"[577]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"He that hath been familiar with the world\r\n  A long while, in his eye 'tis turned about\r\n  Until he sees how false what looked so fair.\"[578]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"The sage's mind still makes him miserable\r\n  In his most happy fortune, but poor fools\r\n  Find happiness even in their misery.\"[579]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí (973-1057 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His visit to Baghdád.]\r\n\r\nThe sceptical and pessimistic tendencies of an age of social decay and\r\npolitical anarchy are unmistakably revealed in the writings of the poet,\r\nphilosopher, and man of letters, Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí, who was born in\r\n973 A.D. at Ma‘arratu ’l-Nu‘mán, a Syrian town situated about twenty\r\nmiles south of Aleppo on the caravan road to Damascus. While yet a child\r\nhe had an attack of small-pox, resulting in partial and eventually in\r\ncomplete blindness, but this calamity, fatal as it might seem to\r\nliterary ambition, was repaired if not entirely made good by his\r\nstupendous powers of memory. After being educated at home under the eye\r\nof his father, a man of some culture and a meritorious poet, he\r\nproceeded to Aleppo, which was still a flourishing centre of the\r\nhumanities, though it could no longer boast such a brilliant array of\r\npoets and scholars as were attracted thither in the palmy days of Sayfu\r\n’l-Dawla. Probably Abu ’l-‘Alá did not enter upon the career of a\r\nprofessional encomiast, to which he seems at first to have inclined: he\r\ndeclares in the preface to his _Saqṭu ’l-Zand_ that he never eulogised\r\nany one with the hope of gaining a reward, but only for the sake of\r\npractising his skill. On the termination of his 'Wanderjahre' he\r\nreturned in 993 A.D. to Ma‘arra, where he spent the next fifteen years\r\nof his life, with no income beyond a small pension of thirty dínárs\r\n(which he shared with a servant), lecturing on Arabic poetry,\r\nantiquities, and philology, the subjects to which his youthful studies\r\nhad been chiefly devoted. During this period his reputation was steadily\r\nincreasing, and at last, to adapt what Boswell wrote of Dr. Johnson on a\r\nsimilar occasion, \"he thought of trying his fortune in Baghdád, the\r\ngreat field of genius and exertion, where talents of every kind had the\r\nfullest scope and the highest encouragement.\" Professor Margoliouth in\r\nthe Introduction to his edition of Abu ’l-‘Alá's correspondence supplies\r\nmany interesting particulars of the literary society at Baghdád in which\r\nthe poet moved. \"As in ancient Rome, so in the great Muḥammadan cities\r\npublic recitation was the mode whereby men of letters made their talents\r\nknown to their contemporaries. From very early times it had been\r\ncustomary to employ the mosques for this purpose; and in Abu ’l-‘Alá's\r\ntime poems were recited in the mosque of al-Manṣúr in Baghdád. Better\r\naccommodation was, however, provided by the Mæcenates who took a pride\r\nin collecting savants and _littérateurs_ in their houses.\"[580] Such a\r\nMæcenas was the Sharíf al-Raḍí, himself a celebrated poet, who founded\r\nthe Academy called by his name in imitation, probably, of that founded\r\nsome years before by Abú Nasr Sábúr b. Ardashír, Vizier to the Buwayhid\r\nprince, Bahá’u ’l-Dawla. Here Abu ’l-‘Alá met a number of distinguished\r\nwriters and scholars who welcomed him as one of themselves. The capital\r\nof Islam, thronged with travellers and merchants from all parts of the\r\nEast, harbouring followers of every creed and sect--Christians and Jews,\r\nBuddhists and Zoroastrians, Ṣábians and Ṣúfís, Materialists and\r\nRationalists--must have seemed to the provincial almost like a new\r\nworld. It is certain that Abu ’l-‘Alá, a curious observer who set no\r\nbounds to his thirst for knowledge, would make the best use of such an\r\nopportunity. The religious and philosophical ideas with which he was now\r\nfirst thrown into contact gradually took root and ripened. His stay in\r\nBaghdád, though it lasted only a year and a half (1009-1010 A.D.),\r\ndecided the whole bent of his mind for the future.\r\n\r\nWhether his return to Ma‘arra was hastened, as he says, by want of means\r\nand the illness of his mother, whom he tenderly loved, or by an\r\nindignity which he suffered at the hands of an influential patron,[581]\r\nimmediately on his arrival he shut himself in his house, adopted a\r\nvegetarian diet and other ascetic practices, and passed the rest of his\r\nlong life in comparative seclusion:--\r\n\r\n \"Methinks, I am thrice imprisoned--ask not me\r\n  Of news that need no telling--\r\n  By loss of sight, confinement to my house,\r\n  And this vile body for my spirit's dwelling.\"[582]\r\n\r\nWe can only conjecture the motives which brought about this sudden\r\nchange of habits and disposition. No doubt his mother's death affected\r\nhim deeply, and he may have been disappointed by his failure to obtain a\r\npermanent footing in the capital. It is not surprising that the blind\r\nand lonely man, looking back on his faded youth, should have felt weary\r\nof the world and its ways, and found in melancholy contemplation of\r\nearthly vanities ever fresh matter for the application and development\r\nof these philosophical ideas which, as we have seen, were probably\r\nsuggested to him by his recent experiences. While in the collection of\r\nearly poems, entitled _Saqṭu ’l-Zand_ or 'The Spark of the Fire-stick'\r\nand mainly composed before his visit to Baghdád, he still treads the\r\ncustomary path of his predecessors,[583] his poems written after that\r\ntime and generally known as the _Luzúmiyyát_[584] arrest attention by\r\ntheir boldness and originality as well as by the sombre and earnest tone\r\nwhich pervades them. This, indeed, is not the view of most Oriental\r\ncritics, who dislike the poet's irreverence and fail to appreciate the\r\nfact that he stood considerably in advance of his age; but in Europe he\r\nhas received full justice and perhaps higher praise than he deserves.\r\nReiske describes him as 'Arabice callentissimum, vasti, subtilis,\r\nsublimis et audacis ingenii';[585] Von Hammer, who ranks him as a poet\r\nwith Abú Tammám, Buḥturí, and Mutanabbí, also mentions him honourably as\r\na philosopher;[586] and finally Von Kremer, who made an exhaustive study\r\nof the _Luzúmiyyát_ and examined their contents in a masterly\r\nessay,[587] discovered in Abu ’l-‘Alá, one of the greatest moralists of\r\nall time whose profound genius anticipated much that is commonly\r\nattributed to the so-called modern spirit of enlightenment. Here Von\r\nKremer's enthusiasm may have carried him too far; for the poet, as\r\nProfessor Margoliouth says, was unconscious of the value of his\r\nsuggestions, unable to follow them out, and unable to adhere to them\r\nconsistently. Although he builded better than he knew, the constructive\r\nside of his philosophy was overshadowed by the negative and destructive\r\nside, so that his pure and lofty morality leaves but a faint impression\r\nwhich soon dies away in louder, continually recurring voices of doubt\r\nand despair.\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Alá is a firm monotheist, but his belief in God amounted, as it\r\nwould seem, to little beyond a conviction that all things are governed\r\nby inexorable Fate, whose mysteries none may fathom and from whose\r\nomnipotence there is no escape. He denies the Resurrection of the dead,\r\n_e.g._:--\r\n\r\n \"We laugh, but inept is our laughter;\r\n  We should weep and weep sore,\r\n  Who are shattered like glass, and thereafter\r\n  Re-moulded no more!\"[588]\r\n\r\nSince Death is the ultimate goal of mankind, the sage will pray to be\r\ndelivered as speedily as possible from the miseries of life and refuse\r\nto inflict upon others what, by no fault of his own, he is doomed to\r\nsuffer:--\r\n\r\n  \"Amends are richly due from sire to son:\r\n  What if thy children rule o'er cities great?\r\n  That eminence estranges them the more\r\n  From thee, and causes them to wax in hate,\r\n  Beholding one who cast them into Life's\r\n  Dark labyrinth whence no wit can extricate.\"[589]\r\n\r\nThere are many passages to the same effect, showing that Abu ’l-‘Alá\r\nregarded procreation as a sin and universal annihilation as the best\r\nhope for humanity. He acted in accordance with his opinions, for he\r\nnever married, and he is said to have desired that the following verse\r\nshould be inscribed on his grave:--\r\n\r\n \"This wrong was by my father done\r\n  To me, but ne'er by me to one.\"[590]\r\n\r\nHating the present life and weary of its burdens, yet seeing no happier\r\nprospect than that of return to non-existence, Abu ’l-‘Alá can scarcely\r\nhave disguised from himself what he might shrink openly to avow--that he\r\nwas at heart, not indeed an atheist, but wholly incredulous of any\r\nDivine revelation. Religion, as he conceives it, is a product of the\r\nhuman mind, in which men believe through force of habit and education,\r\nnever stopping to consider whether it is true.\r\n\r\n  \"Sometimes you may find a man skilful in his trade, perfect in\r\n  sagacity and in the use of arguments, but when he comes to religion\r\n  he is found obstinate, so does he follow the old groove. Piety is\r\n  implanted in human nature; it is deemed a sure refuge. To the\r\n  growing child that which falls from his elders' lips is a lesson\r\n  that abides with him all his life. Monks in their cloisters and\r\n  devotees in the mosques accept their creed just as a story is handed\r\n  down from him who tells it, without distinguishing between a true\r\n  interpreter and a false. If one of these had found his kin among the\r\n  Magians, he would have declared himself a Magian, or among the\r\n  Ṣábians, he would have become nearly or quite like _them_.\"[591]\r\n\r\nReligion, then, is \"a fable invented by the ancients,\" worthless except\r\nto those unscrupulous persons who prey upon human folly and\r\nsuperstition. Islam is neither better nor worse than any other creed:--\r\n\r\n \"Ḥanífs are stumbling,[592] Christians all astray,\r\n  Jews wildered, Magians far on error's way.\r\n  We mortals are composed of two great schools--\r\n  Enlightened knaves or else religious fools.\"[593]\r\n\r\nNot only does the poet emphatically reject the proud claim of Islam to\r\npossess a monopoly of truth, but he attacks most of its dogmas in\r\ndetail. As to the Koran, Abu ’l-‘Alá could not altogether refrain from\r\ndoubting if it was really the Word of God, but he thought so well of the\r\nstyle that he accepted the challenge flung down by Muḥammad and\r\nproduced a rival work (_al-Fuṣúl wa-’l-Gháyát_), which appears to\r\nhave been a somewhat frivolous parody of the sacred volume, though in\r\nthe author's judgment its inferiority was simply due to the fact that it\r\nwas not yet polished by the tongues of four centuries of readers.\r\nAnother work which must have sorely offended orthodox Muḥammadans is\r\nthe _Risálatu ’l-Ghufrán_ (Epistle of Forgiveness).[594] Here the\r\nParadise of the Faithful becomes a glorified salon tenanted by various\r\nheathen poets who have been forgiven--hence the title--and received\r\namong the Blest. This idea is carried out with much ingenuity and in a\r\nspirit of audacious burlesque that reminds us of Lucian. The poets are\r\npresented in a series of imaginary conversations with a certain Shaykh\r\n‘Alí b. Manṣúr, to whom the work is addressed, reciting and\r\nexplaining their verses, quarrelling with one another, and generally\r\nbehaving as literary Bohemians. The second part contains a number of\r\nanecdotes relating to the _zindíqs_ or freethinkers of Islam\r\ninterspersed with quotations from their poetry and reflections on the\r\nnature of their belief, which Abu ’l-‘Alá condemns while expressing a\r\npious hope that they are not so black as they paint themselves. At this\r\ntime it may have suited him--he was over sixty--to assume the attitude\r\nof charitable orthodoxy. Like so many wise men of the East, he practised\r\ndissimulation as a fine art--\r\n\r\n \"I lift my voice to utter lies absurd,\r\n  But when I speak the truth, my hushed tones scarce are heard.\"[595]\r\n\r\nIn the _Luzúmiyyát_, however, he often unmasks. Thus he describes as\r\nidolatrous relics the two Pillars of the Ka‘ba and the Black Stone,\r\nvenerated by every Moslem, and calls the Pilgrimage itself 'a heathen's\r\njourney' (_riḥlatu jáhiliyyin_). The following sentiments do him\r\nhonour, but they would have been rank heresy at Mecca:--\r\n\r\n \"Praise God and pray,\r\n  Walk seventy times, not seven, the Temple round--\r\n  And impious remain!\r\n  Devout is he alone who, when he may\r\n  Feast his desires, is found\r\n  With courage to abstain.\"[596]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to give further instances of the poet's contempt for the\r\nMuḥammadan articles of faith. Considering that he assailed persons as\r\nwell as principles, and lashed with bitter invective the powerful class\r\nof the _‘Ulamá_, the clerical and legal representatives of Islam, we may\r\nwonder that the accusation of heresy brought against him was never\r\npushed home and had no serious consequences. The question was warmly\r\nargued on both sides, and though Abu ’l-‘Alá was pronounced by the\r\nmajority to be a freethinker and materialist, he did not lack defenders\r\nwho quoted chapter and verse to prove that he was nothing of the kind.\r\nIt must be remembered that his works contain no philosophical system;\r\nthat his opinions have to be gathered from the ideas which he scatters\r\nincoherently, and for the most part in guarded language, through a long\r\nsuccession of rhymes; and that this task, already arduous enough, is\r\ncomplicated by the not infrequent occurrence of sentiments which are\r\nblamelessly orthodox and entirely contradictory to the rest. A brilliant\r\nwriter, familiar with Eastern ways of thinking, has observed that in\r\ngeneral the conscience of an Asiatic is composed of the following\r\ningredients: (1) an almost bare religious designation; (2) a more or\r\nless lively belief in certain doctrines of the creed which he professes;\r\n(3) a resolute opposition to many of its doctrines, even if they should\r\nbe the most essential; (4) a fund of ideas relating to completely alien\r\ntheories, which occupies more or less room; (5) a constant tendency to\r\nget rid of these ideas and theories and to replace the old by new.[597]\r\nSuch phenomena will account for a great deal of logical inconsistency,\r\nbut we should beware of invoking them too confidently in this case. Abu\r\n’l-‘Alá with his keen intellect and unfanatical temperament was not the\r\nman to let himself be mystified. Still lamer is the explanation offered\r\nby some Muḥammadan critics, that his thoughts were decided by the\r\nnecessities of the difficult metre in which he wrote. It is conceivable\r\nthat he may sometimes have doubted his own doubts and given Islam the\r\nbenefit, but Von Kremer's conclusion is probably near the truth, namely,\r\nthat where the poet speaks as a good Moslem, his phrases if they are not\r\npurely conventional are introduced of set purpose to foil his pious\r\nantagonists or to throw them off the scent. Although he was not without\r\nreligion in the larger sense of the word, unprejudiced students of the\r\nlater poems must recognise that from the orthodox standpoint he was\r\njustly branded as an infidel. The following translations will serve to\r\nillustrate the negative side of his philosophy:--\r\n\r\n \"Falsehood hath so corrupted all the world\r\n  That wrangling sects each other's gospel chide;\r\n  But were not hate Man's natural element,\r\n  Churches and mosques had risen side by side.\"[598]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"What is Religion? A maid kept close that no eye may view her;\r\n  The price of her wedding-gifts and dowry baffles the wooer.\r\n  Of all the goodly doctrine that I from the pulpit heard\r\n  My heart has never accepted so much as a single word!\"[599]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"The pillars of this earth are four,\r\n    Which lend to human life a base;\r\n    God shaped two vessels, Time and Space,\r\n  The world and all its folk to store.\r\n\r\n \"That which Time holds, in ignorance\r\n    It holds--why vent on it our spite?\r\n    Man is no cave-bound eremite,\r\n  But still an eager spy on Chance.\r\n\r\n \"He trembles to be laid asleep,\r\n    Tho' worn and old and weary grown.\r\n    We laugh and weep by Fate alone,\r\n  Time moves us not to laugh or weep;\r\n\r\n \"Yet we accuse it innocent,\r\n    Which, could it speak, might us accuse,\r\n    Our best and worst, at will to choose,\r\n  United in a sinful bent.\"[600]\r\n\r\n \"'The stars' conjunction comes, divinely sent,\r\n  And lo, the veil o'er every creed is rent.\r\n  No realm is founded that escapes decay,\r\n  The firmest structure soon dissolves away.[601]\r\n  With sadness deep a thoughtful mind must scan\r\n  Religion made to serve the pelf of Man.\r\n  Fear thine own children: sparks at random flung\r\n  Consume the very tinder whence they sprung.\r\n  Evil are all men; I distinguish not\r\n  That part or this: the race entire I blot.\r\n  Trust none, however near akin, tho' he\r\n  A perfect sense of honour show to thee,\r\n  Thy self is the worst foe to be withstood:\r\n  Be on thy guard in hours of solitude.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n \"Desire a venerable shaykh to cite\r\n  Reason for his doctrine, he is gravelled quite.\r\n  What! shall I ripen ere a leaf is seen?\r\n  The tree bears only when 'tis clad in green.\"[602]\r\n\r\n\r\n \"How have I provoked your enmity?\r\n  Christ or Muḥammad, 'tis one to me.\r\n  No rays of dawn our path illume,\r\n  We are sunk together in ceaseless gloom.\r\n  Can blind perceptions lead aright,\r\n  Or blear eyes ever have clear sight?\r\n  Well may a body racked with pain\r\n  Envy mouldering bones in vain;\r\n  Yet comes a day when the weary sword\r\n  Reposes, to its sheath restored.\r\n  Ah, who to me a frame will give\r\n  As clod or stone insensitive?--\r\n  For when spirit is joined to flesh, the pair\r\n  Anguish of mortal sickness share.\r\n  O Wind, be still, if wind thy name,\r\n  O Flame, die out, if thou art flame!\"[603]\r\n\r\nPessimist and sceptic as he was, Abu ’l-‘Alá denies more than he\r\naffirms, but although he rejected the dogmas of positive religion, he\r\ndid not fall into utter unbelief; for he found within himself a moral\r\nlaw to which he could not refuse obedience.\r\n\r\n \"Take Reason for thy guide and do what she\r\n  Approves, the best of counsellors in sooth.\r\n  Accept no law the Pentateuch lays down:\r\n  Not there is what thou seekest--the plain truth.\"[604]\r\n\r\nHe insists repeatedly that virtue is its own reward.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, purge the good thou dost from hope of recompense\r\n  Or profit, as if thou wert one that sells his wares.\"[605]\r\n\r\nHis creed is that of a philosopher and ascetic. Slay no living creature,\r\nhe says; better spare a flea than give alms. Yet he prefers active\r\npiety, active humanity, to fasting and prayer. \"The gist of his moral\r\nteaching is to inculcate as the highest and holiest duty a conscientious\r\nfulfilment of one's obligations with equal warmth and affection towards\r\nall living beings.\"[606]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Alá died in 1057 A.D., at the age of eighty-four. About ten\r\nyears before this time, the Persian poet and traveller, Náṣir-i\r\nKhusraw, passed through Ma‘arra on his way to Egypt. He describes Abu\r\n’l-‘Alá as the chief man in the town, very rich, revered by the\r\ninhabitants, and surrounded by more than two hundred students who came\r\nfrom all parts to attend his lectures on literature and poetry.[607] We\r\nmay set this trustworthy notice against the doleful account which Abu\r\n’l-‘Alá gives of himself in his letters and other works. If not among\r\nthe greatest Muḥammadan poets, he is undoubtedly one of the most\r\noriginal and attractive. After Mutanabbí, even after Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya, he\r\nmust appear strangely modern to the European reader. It is astonishing\r\nto reflect that a spirit so unconventional, so free from dogmatic\r\nprejudice, so rational in spite of his pessimism and deeply religious\r\nnotwithstanding his attacks on revealed religion, should have ended his\r\nlife in a Syrian country-town some years before the battle of Senlac.\r\nAlthough he did not meddle with politics and held aloof from every sect,\r\nhe could truly say of himself, \"I am the son of my time\" (_ghadawtu ’bna\r\nwaqtí_).[608] His poems leave no aspect of the age untouched, and\r\npresent a vivid picture of degeneracy and corruption, in which tyrannous\r\nrulers, venal judges, hypocritical and unscrupulous theologians,\r\nswindling astrologers, roving swarms of dervishes and godless\r\nCarmathians occupy a prominent place.[609]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the reader may think that too much space has been already\r\ndevoted to poetry, I will venture by way of concluding the subject to\r\nmention very briefly a few well-known names which cannot be altogether\r\nomitted from a work of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú Tammám and Buḥturí.]\r\n\r\nAbú Tammám (Ḥabíb b. Aws) and Buḥturí, both of whom flourished in the\r\nninth century, were distinguished court poets of the same type as\r\nMutanabbí, but their reputation rests more securely on the anthologies\r\nwhich they compiled under the title of _Ḥamása_ (see p. 129 seq.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibnu ’l-Mu‘tazz (861-908 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Abbás ‘Abdulláh, the son of the Caliph al-Mu‘tazz, was a\r\nversatile poet and man of letters, who showed his originality by the\r\nworks which he produced in two novel styles of composition. It has often\r\nbeen remarked that the Arabs have no great epos like the Iliad or the\r\nPersian _Sháhnáma_, but only prose narratives which, though sometimes\r\nepical in tone, are better described as historical romances. Ibnu\r\n’l-Mu‘tazz could not supply the deficiency. He wrote, however, in praise\r\nof his cousin, the Caliph Mu‘taḍid, a metrical epic in miniature,\r\ncommencing with a graphic delineation of the wretched state to which the\r\nEmpire had been reduced by the rapacity and tyranny of the Turkish\r\nmercenaries. He composed also, besides an anthology of Bacchanalian\r\npieces, the first important work on Poetics (_Kitábu ’l-Badí‘_). A sad\r\ndestiny was in store for this accomplished prince. On the death of the\r\nCaliph Muktarí he was called to the throne, but a few hours after his\r\naccession he was overpowered by the partisans of Muqtadir, who strangled\r\nhim as soon as they discovered his hiding-place. Picturing the scene,\r\none thinks almost inevitably of Nero's dying words, _Qualis artifex\r\npereo!_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Umar Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ (1181-1235 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe mystical poetry of the Arabs is far inferior, as a whole, to that of\r\nthe Persians. Fervour and passion it has in the highest degree, but it\r\nlacks range and substance, not to speak of imaginative and speculative\r\npower. ‘Umar Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ, though he is undoubtedly the poet of Arabian\r\nmysticism, cannot sustain a comparison with his great Persian\r\ncontemporary, Jalálu’l-Dín Rúmí († 1273 A.D.); he surpasses him only in\r\nthe intense glow and exquisite beauty of his diction. It will be\r\nconvenient to reserve a further account of Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ for the next\r\nchapter, where we shall discuss the development of Ṣúfiism during this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nFinally two writers claim attention who owe their reputation to single\r\npoems--a by no means rare phenomenon in the history of Arabic\r\nliterature. One of these universally celebrated odes is the _Lámiyyatu\r\n’l-‘Ajam_ (the ode rhyming in _l_ of the non-Arabs) composed in the year\r\n1111 A.D. by Ṭughrá’í; the other is the _Burda_ (Mantle Ode) of\r\nBúṣírí, which I take the liberty of mentioning in this chapter,\r\nalthough its author died some forty years after the Mongol Invasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṭughrá’í († _circa_ 1120 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nḤasan b. ‘Alí al-Ṭughrá’í was of Persian descent and a native of\r\nIṣfahán.[610] He held the offices of _kátib_ (secretary) and _munshí_ or\r\n_ṭughrá’í_ (chancellor) under the great Seljúq Sultans, Maliksháh and\r\nMuḥammad, and afterwards became Vizier to the Seljúqid prince Ghiyáthu\r\n’l-Dín Mas‘úd[611] in Mosul. He derived the title by which he is\r\ngenerally known from the royal signature (_ṭughrá_) which it was his\r\nduty to indite on all State papers over the initial _Bismilláh_. The\r\n_Lámiyyatu ’l-‘Ajam_ is so called with reference to Shanfará's renowned\r\npoem, the _Lámiyyatu ’l-‘Arab_ (see p. 79 seq.), which rhymes in the\r\nsame letter; otherwise the two odes have only this in common,[612] that\r\nwhereas Shanfará depicts the hardships of an outlaw's life in the\r\ndesert, Ṭughrá’í, writing in Baghdád, laments the evil times on which he\r\nhas fallen, and complains that younger rivals, base and servile men, are\r\npreferred to him, while he is left friendless and neglected in his old\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Búṣírí († _circa_ 1296 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe _Qaṣídatu ’l-Burda_ (Mantle Ode) of al-Búṣírí[613] is a hymn in\r\npraise of the Prophet. Its author was born in Egypt in 1212 A.D. We know\r\nscarcely anything concerning his life, which, as he himself declares,\r\nwas passed in writing poetry and in paying court to the great[614]; but\r\nhis biographers tell us that he supported himself by copying\r\nmanuscripts, and that he was a disciple of the eminent Ṣúfí, Abu\r\n’l-‘Abbás Aḥmad al-Marsí. It is said that he composed the _Burda_ while\r\nsuffering from a stroke which paralysed one half of his body. After\r\npraying God to heal him, he began to recite the poem. Presently he fell\r\nasleep and dreamed that he saw the Prophet, who touched his palsied side\r\nand threw his mantle (_burda_) over him.[615] \"Then,\" said al-Búṣírí, \"I\r\nawoke and found myself able to rise.\" However this may be, the Mantle\r\nOde is held in extraordinary veneration by Muḥammadans. Its verses are\r\noften learned by heart and inscribed in golden letters on the walls of\r\npublic buildings; and not only is the whole poem regarded as a charm\r\nagainst evil, but some peculiar magical power is supposed to reside in\r\neach verse separately. Although its poetical merit is no more than\r\nrespectable, the _Burda_ may be read with pleasure on account of its\r\nsmooth and elegant style, and with interest as setting forth in brief\r\ncompass the mediæval legend of the Prophet--a legend full of prodigies\r\nand miracles in which the historical figure of Muḥammad is glorified\r\nalmost beyond recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rhymed prose.]\r\n\r\nRhymed prose (_saj‘_) long retained the religious associations which it\r\npossessed in Pre-islamic times and which were consecrated, for all\r\nMoslems, by its use in the Koran. About the middle of the ninth century\r\nit began to appear in the public sermons (_khuṭab_, sing.\r\n_khuṭba_) of the Caliphs and their viceroys, and it was still further\r\ndeveloped by professional preachers, like Ibn Nubáta († 984 A.D.), and\r\nby official secretaries, like Ibráhím b. Hilál al-Ṣábí († 994 A.D.).\r\nHenceforth rhyme becomes a distinctive and almost indispensable feature\r\nof rhetorical prose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Badí‘u ’l-Zamán al-Hamadhání († 1007 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe credit of inventing, or at any rate of making popular, a new and\r\nremarkable form of composition in this style belongs to al-Hamadhání (†\r\n1007 A.D.), on whom posterity conferred the title _Badí‘u ’l-Zamán_,\r\n_i.e._, 'the Wonder of the Age.' Born in Hamadhán (Ecbatana), he left\r\nhis native town as a young man and travelled through the greater part of\r\nPersia, living by his wits and astonishing all whom he met by his talent\r\nfor improvisation. His _Maqámát_ may be called a romance or literary\r\nBohemianism. In the _maqáma_ we find some approach to the dramatic\r\nstyle, which has never been cultivated by the Semites.[616] Hamadhání\r\nimagined as his hero a witty, unscrupulous vagabond journeying from\r\nplace to place and supporting himself by the presents which his\r\nimpromptu displays of rhetoric, poetry, and learning seldom failed to\r\ndraw from an admiring audience. The second character is the _ráwí_ or\r\nnarrator, \"who should be continually meeting with the other, should\r\nrelate his adventures, and repeat his excellent compositions.\"[617] The\r\n_Maqámát_ of Hamadhání became the model for this kind of writing, and\r\nthe types which he created survive unaltered in the more elaborate work\r\nof his successors. Each _maqáma_ forms an independent whole, so that the\r\ncomplete series may be regarded as a novel consisting of detached\r\nepisodes in the hero's life, a medley of prose and verse in which the\r\nstory is nothing, the style everything.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ḥarírí (1054-1122 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nLess original than Badí‘u ’l-Zamán, but far beyond him in variety of\r\nlearning and copiousness of language, Abú Muḥammad al-Qásim\r\nal-Ḥarírí of Baṣra produced in his _Maqámát_ a masterpiece which\r\nfor eight centuries \"has been esteemed as, next to the Koran, the chief\r\ntreasure of the Arabic tongue.\" In the Preface to his work he says that\r\nthe composition of _maqámát_ was suggested to him by \"one whose\r\nsuggestion is a command and whom it is a pleasure to obey.\" This was the\r\ndistinguished Persian statesman, Anúshirwán b. Khálid,[618] who\r\nafterwards served as Vizier under the Caliph Mustarshid Billáh\r\n(1118-1135 A.D.) and Sultán Mas‘úd, the Seljúq (1133-1152 A.D.); but at\r\nthe time when he made Ḥarírí's acquaintance he was living in\r\nretirement at Baṣra and devoting himself to literary studies.\r\nḤarírí begged to be excused on the score that his abilities were\r\nunequal to the task, \"for the lame steed cannot run like the strong\r\ncourser.\"[619] Finally, however, he yielded to the request of\r\nAnúshirwán, and, to quote his own words--\r\n\r\n \"I composed, in spite of hindrances that I suffered\r\n  From dullness of capacity and dimness of intellect,\r\n  And dryness of imagination and distressing anxieties,\r\n  Fifty Maqámát, which contain serious language and lightsome,\r\n  And combine refinement with dignity of style,\r\n  And brilliancies with jewels of eloquence,\r\n  And beauties of literature with its rarities,\r\n  Beside verses of the Koran wherewith I adorned them,\r\n  And choice metaphors, and Arab proverbs that I interspersed,\r\n  And literary elegancies and grammatical riddles,\r\n  And decisions based on the (double) meaning of words,\r\n  And original discourses and highly-wrought orations,\r\n  And affecting exhortations as well as entertaining jests:\r\n  The whole of which I have indited as by the tongue of Abú Zayd\r\n    of Sarúj,\r\n  The part of narrator being assigned to Harith son of Hammám\r\n    of Baṣra.\"[620]\r\n\r\nḤarírí then proceeds to argue that his _Maqámát_ are not mere frivolous\r\nstories such as strict Moslems are bound to reprobate in accordance with\r\na well-known passage of the Koran referring to Naḍr b. Ḥárith, who\r\nmortally offended the Prophet by amusing the Quraysh with the old\r\nPersian legends of Rustam and Isfandiyár (Koran, xxxi, 5-6): \"_There is\r\none that buyeth idle tales that he may seduce men from the way of God,\r\nwithout knowledge, and make it a laughing-stock: these shall suffer a\r\nshameful punishment. And when Our signs are read to him, he turneth his\r\nback in disdain as though he heard them not, as though there were in his\r\nears a deafness: give him joy of a grievous punishment!_\" Ḥarírí insists\r\nthat the _Assemblies_ have a moral purpose. The ignorant and malicious,\r\nhe says, will probably condemn his work, but intelligent readers will\r\nperceive, if they lay prejudice aside, that it is as useful and\r\ninstructive as the fables of beasts, &c.,[621] to which no one has ever\r\nobjected. That his fears of hostile criticism were not altogether\r\ngroundless is shown by the following remarks of the author of the\r\npopular history entitled _al-Fakhrí_ († _circa_ 1300 A.D.). This\r\nwriter, after claiming that his own book is more useful than the\r\n_Ḥamása_ of Abú Tammám, continues:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: _Maqámát_ criticised as immoral.]\r\n\r\n  \"And, again, it is more profitable than the _Maqámát_ on which men\r\n  have set their hearts, and which they eagerly commit to memory;\r\n  because the reader derives no benefit from _Maqámát_ except\r\n  familiarity with elegant composition and knowledge of the rules of\r\n  verse and prose. Undoubtedly they contain maxims and ingenious\r\n  devices and experiences; but all this has a debasing effect on the\r\n  mind, for it is founded on begging and sponging and disgraceful\r\n  scheming to acquire a few paltry pence. Therefore, if they do good\r\n  in one direction, they do harm in another; and this point has been\r\n  noticed by some critics of the _Maqámát_ of Ḥarírí and Badí‘u\r\n  ’l-Zamán.\"[622]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of Abú Zayd.]\r\n\r\nBefore pronouncing on the justice of this censure, we must consider for\r\na moment the character of Abú Zayd, the hero of Ḥarírí's work, whose\r\nadventures are related by a certain Ḥárith b. Hammám, under which\r\nname the author is supposed to signify himself. According to the general\r\ntradition, Ḥarírí was one day seated with a number of savants in the\r\nmosque of the Banú Ḥarám at Baṣra, when an old man entered,\r\nfootsore and travel-stained. On being asked who he was and whence he\r\ncame, he answered that his name of honour was Abú Zayd and that he came\r\nfrom Sarúj.[623] He described in eloquent and moving terms how his\r\nnative town had been plundered by the Greeks, who made his daughter a\r\ncaptive and drove him forth to exile and poverty. Ḥarírí was so\r\nstruck with his wonderful powers of improvisation that on the same\r\nevening he began to compose the _Maqáma of the Banú Ḥarám_,[624]\r\nwhere Abú Zayd is introduced in his invariable character: \"a crafty old\r\nman, full of genius and learning, unscrupulous of the artifices which he\r\nuses to effect his purpose, reckless in spending in forbidden\r\nindulgences the money he has obtained by his wit or deceit, but with\r\nveins of true feeling in him, and ever yielding to unfeigned emotion\r\nwhen he remembers his devastated home and his captive child.\"[625] If an\r\nimmoral tendency has been attributed to the _Assemblies_ of Ḥarírí it\r\nis because the author does not conceal his admiration for this\r\nunprincipled and thoroughly disreputable scamp. Abú Zayd, indeed, is\r\nmade so fascinating that we can easily pardon his knaveries for the sake\r\nof the pearls of wit and wisdom which he scatters in splendid\r\nprofusion--excellent discourses, edifying sermons, and plaintive\r\nlamentations mingled with rollicking ditties and ribald jests. Modern\r\nreaders are not likely to agree with the historian quoted above, but\r\nalthough they may deem his criticism illiberal, they can hardly deny\r\nthat it has some justification.\r\n\r\nḤarírí's rhymed prose might be freely imitated in English, but the\r\ndifficulty of rendering it in rhyme with tolerable fidelity has caused\r\nme to abandon the attempt to produce a version of one of the\r\n_Assemblies_ in the original form.[626] I will translate instead three\r\npoems which are put into the mouth of Abú Zayd. The first is a tender\r\nelegiac strain recalling far-off days of youth and happiness in his\r\nnative land:--\r\n\r\n \"Ghassán is my noble kindred, Sarúj is my land of birth,\r\n  Where I dwelt in a lofty mansion of sunlike glory and worth,\r\n  A Paradise for its sweetness and beauty and pleasant mirth!\r\n\r\n  And oh, the life that I led there abounding in all delight!\r\n  I trailed my robe on its meadows, while Time flew a careless flight,\r\n  Elate in the flower of manhood, no pleasure veiled from my sight.\r\n\r\n  Now, if woe could kill, I had died of the troubles that haunt me here,\r\n  Or could past joy ever be ransomed, my heart's blood had not been\r\n    dear,\r\n  Since death is better than living a brute's life year after year.\r\n\r\n  Subdued to scorn as a lion whom base hyenas torment.\r\n  But Luck is to blame, else no one had failed of his due ascent:\r\n  If she were straight, the conditions of men would never be bent.\"[627]\r\n\r\nThe scene of the eleventh _Assembly_ is laid in Sáwa, a city lying\r\nmidway between Hamadhán (Ecbatana) and Rayy (Rhages). \"Ḥárith, in a\r\nfit of religious zeal, betakes himself to the public burial ground, for\r\nthe purpose of contemplation. He finds a funeral in progress, and when\r\nit is over an old man, with his face muffled in a cloak, takes his stand\r\non a hillock, and pours forth a discourse on the certainty of death and\r\njudgment.... He then rises into poetry and declaims a piece which is one\r\nof the noblest productions of Arabic literature. In lofty morality, in\r\nreligious fervour, in beauty of language, in power and grace of metre,\r\nthis magnificent hymn is unsurpassed.\"[628]\r\n\r\n \"Pretending sense in vain, how long, O light of brain, wilt thou heap\r\n    sin and bane, and compass error's span?\r\n  Thy conscious guilt avow! The white hairs on thy brow admonish thee,\r\n    and thou hast ears unstopt, O man!\r\n  Death's call dost thou not hear? Rings not his voice full clear? Of\r\n    parting hast no fear, to make thee sad and wise?\r\n  How long sunk in a sea of sloth and vanity wilt thou play heedlessly,\r\n    as though Death spared his prize?\r\n  Till when, far wandering from virtue, wilt thou cling to evil ways\r\n    that bring together vice in brief?\r\n  For thy Lord's anger shame thou hast none, but let maim o'ertake thy\r\n    cherished aim, then feel'st thou burning grief.\r\n  Thou hail'st with eager joy the coin of yellow die, but if a bier pass\r\n    by, feigned is thy sorry face;\r\n  Perverse and callous wight! thou scornest counsel right to follow\r\n    the false light of treachery and disgrace.\r\n  Thy pleasure thou dost crave, to sordid gain a slave, forgetting\r\n    the dark grave and what remains of dole;\r\n  Were thy true weal descried, thy lust would not misguide nor thou\r\n    be terrified by words that should console.\r\n  Not tears, blood shall thine eyes pour at the great Assize, when thou\r\n    hast no allies, no kinsman thee to save;\r\n  Straiter thy tomb shall be than needle's cavity: deep, deep thy plunge\r\n    I see as diver's 'neath the wave.\r\n  There shall thy limbs be laid, a feast for worms arrayed, till utterly\r\n    decayed are wood and bones withal,\r\n  Nor may thy soul repel that ordeal horrible, when o'er the Bridge of\r\n    Hell she must escape or fall.\r\n  Astray shall leaders go, and mighty men be low, and sages shall cry,\r\n   'Woe like this was never yet.'\r\n  Then haste, my thoughtless friend, what thou hast marred to mend,\r\n    for life draws near its end, and still thou art in the net.\r\n  Trust not in fortune, nay, though she be soft and gay; for she will\r\n    spit one day her venom, if thou dote;\r\n  Abate thy haughty pride! lo, Death is at thy side, fastening, whate'er\r\n    betide, his fingers on thy throat.\r\n  When prosperous, refrain from arrogant disdain, nor give thy tongue\r\n    the rein: a modest tongue is best.\r\n  Comfort the child of bale and listen to his tale: repair thine actions\r\n    frail, and be for ever blest.\r\n  Feather the nest once more of those whose little store has vanished:\r\n    ne'er deplore the loss nor miser be;\r\n  With meanness bravely cope, and teach thine hand to ope, and spurn\r\n    the misanthrope, and make thy bounty free.\r\n  Lay up provision fair and leave what brings thee care: for sea\r\n    the ship prepare and dread the rising storm.\r\n  This, friend, is what I preach expressed in lucid speech. Good luck\r\n    to all and each who with my creed conform!\"\r\n\r\nIn the next _Maqáma_--that of Damascus--we find Abú Zayd, gaily attired,\r\namidst casks and vats of wine, carousing and listening to the music of\r\nlutes and singing--\r\n\r\n \"I ride and I ride through the waste far and wide, and I fling away\r\n    pride to be gay as the swallow;\r\n  Stem the torrent's fierce speed, tame the mettlesome steed, that\r\n    wherever I lead Youth and Pleasure may follow.\r\n  I bid gravity pack, and I strip bare my back lest liquor I lack when\r\n    the goblet is lifted:\r\n  Did I never incline to the quaffing of wine, I had ne'er been with\r\n    fine wit and eloquence gifted.\r\n  Is it wonderful, pray, that an old man should stay in a well-stored\r\n    seray by a cask overflowing?\r\n  Wine strengthens the knees, physics every disease, and from sorrow\r\n    it frees, the oblivion-bestowing!\r\n  Oh, the purest of joys is to live sans disguise unconstrained by\r\n    the ties of a grave reputation,\r\n  And the sweetest of love that the lover can prove is when fear and\r\n    hope move him to utter his passion.\r\n  Thy love then proclaim, quench the smouldering flame, for 'twill\r\n    spark out thy shame and betray thee to laughter:\r\n  Heal the wounds of thine heart and assuage thou the smart by the cups\r\n    that impart a delight men seek after;\r\n  While to hand thee the bowl damsels wait who cajole and enravish\r\n    the soul with eyes tenderly glancing,\r\n  And singers whose throats pour such high-mounting notes, when\r\n    the melody floats, iron rocks would be dancing!\r\n  Obey not the fool who forbids thee to pull beauty's rose when in\r\n    full bloom thou'rt free to possess it;\r\n  Pursue thine end still, tho' it seem past thy skill; let them say\r\n    what they will, take thy pleasure and bless it!\r\n  Get thee gone from thy sire, if he thwart thy desire; spread thy\r\n    nets nor enquire what the nets are receiving;\r\n  But be true to a friend, shun the miser and spend, ways of charity\r\n    wend, be unwearied in giving.\r\n  He that knocks enters straight at the Merciful's gate, so repent\r\n    or e'er Fate call thee forth from the living!\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may judge from these extracts whether the _Assemblies_ of\r\nḤarírí are so deficient in matter as some critics have imagined. But,\r\nof course, the celebrity of the work is mainly due to its consummate\r\nliterary form--a point on which the Arabs have always bestowed singular\r\nattention. Ḥarírí himself was a subtle grammarian, living in\r\nBaṣra, the home of philological science;[629] and though he wrote to\r\nplease rather than to instruct, he seems to have resolved that his work\r\nshould illustrate every beauty and nicety of which the Arabic language\r\nis capable. We Europeans can see as little merit or taste in the verbal\r\nconceits--equivoques, paronomasias, assonances, alliterations,\r\n&c.--with which his pages are thickly studded, as in _tours de force_\r\nof composition which may be read either forwards or backwards, or which\r\nconsist entirely of pointed or of unpointed letters; but our impatience\r\nof such things should not blind us to the fact that they are intimately\r\nconnected with the genius and traditions of the Arabic tongue,[630] and\r\ntherefore stand on a very different footing from those euphuistic\r\nextravagances which appear, for example, in English literature of the\r\nElizabethan age. By Ḥarírí's countrymen the _Maqámát_ are prized as\r\nan almost unique monument of their language, antiquities, and culture.\r\nOne of the author's contemporaries, the famous Zamakhsharí, has\r\nexpressed the general verdict in pithy verse--\r\n\r\n \"I swear by God and His marvels,\r\n  By the pilgrims' rite and their shrine:\r\n  Ḥarírí's _Assemblies_ are worthy\r\n  To be written in gold each line.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The religious literature of the period.]\r\n\r\nConcerning some of the specifically religious sciences, such as Dogmatic\r\nTheology and Mysticism, we shall have more to say in the following\r\nchapter, while as to the science of Apostolic Tradition (_Ḥadíth_) we\r\nmust refer the reader to what has been already said. All that can be\r\nattempted here is to take a passing notice of the most eminent writers\r\nand the most celebrated works of this epoch in the field of religion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Málik b. Anas (713-795 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe place of honour belongs to the Imám Málik b. Anas of Medína, whose\r\n_Muwaṭṭa’_ is the first great _corpus_ of Muḥammadan Law. He\r\nwas a partisan of the ‘Alids, and was flogged by command of the Caliph\r\nManṣúr in consequence of his declaration that he did not consider the\r\noath of allegiance to the ‘Abbásid dynasty to have any binding effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bukhárí and Muslim.]\r\n\r\nThe two principal authorities for Apostolic Tradition are Bukhárí († 870\r\nA.D.) and Muslim († 875 A.D.), authors of the collections entitled\r\n_Ṣaḥíḥ_. Compilations of a narrower range, embracing only those\r\ntraditions which bear on the _Sunna_ or custom of the Prophet, are the\r\n_Sunan_ of Abú Dáwúd al-Sijistání († 889 A.D.), the _Jámi‘_ of Abú ‘Isá\r\nMuḥammad al-Tirmidhí († 892 A.D.), the _Sunan_ of al-Nasá’í († 915\r\nA.D.), and the _Sunan_ of Ibn Mája († 896 A.D.). These, together with the\r\n_Ṣaḥíḥs_ of Bukhárí and Muslim, form the Six Canonical Books\r\n(_al-kutub al-sitta_), which are held in the highest veneration. Amongst\r\nthe innumerable works of a similar kind produced in this period it will\r\nsuffice to mention the _Maṣábíḥu ’l-Sunna_ by al-Baghawí (†\r\n_circa_ 1120 A.D.). A later adaptation called _Mishkátu\r\n’l-Maṣábíḥ_ has been often printed, and is still extremely\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Máwardí († 1058 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabic authorities on Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ghazálí († 1111 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nOmitting the great manuals of Moslem Jurisprudence, which are without\r\nliterary interest in the larger sense, we may pause for a moment at the\r\nname of al-Máwardí, a Sháfi‘ite lawyer, who wrote a well-known treatise\r\non politics--the _Kitábu ’l-Aḥkám al-Sulṭániyya_, or 'Book of the\r\nPrinciples of Government.' His standpoint is purely theoretical. Thus he\r\nlays down that the Caliph should be elected by the body of learned,\r\npious, and orthodox divines, and that the people must leave the\r\nadministration of the State to the Caliph absolutely, as being its\r\nrepresentative. Máwardí lived at Baghdád during the period of Buwayhid\r\nascendancy, a period described by Sir W. Muir in the following words:\r\n\"The pages of our annalists are now almost entirely occupied with the\r\npolitical events of the day, in the guidance of which the Caliphs had\r\nseldom any concern, and which therefore need no mention here.\"[631]\r\nUnder the ‘Abbásid dynasty the mystical doctrines of the Ṣúfís were\r\nsystematised and expounded. Some of the most important Arabic works of\r\nreference on Ṣúfiism are the _Qútu ’l-Qulúb_, or 'Food of Hearts,' by\r\nAbú Ṭálib al-Makkí († 996 A.D.); the _Kitábu ’l-Ta‘arruf li-Madhhabi\r\nahli ’l-Taṣawwuf_, or 'Book of Enquiry as to the Religion of the\r\nṢúfís,' by Muḥammad b. Isḥáq al-Kalábádhí († _circa_ 1000 A.D.);\r\nthe _Ṭabaqátu ’l-Ṣúfiyya_, or 'Classes of the Ṣúfís,' by Abú\r\n‘Abd al-Raḥmán al-Sulamí († 1021 A.D.); the _Ḥilyatu ’l-Awliyá_,\r\nor 'Adornment of the Saints,' by Abú Nu‘aym al-Iṣfahání († 1038\r\nA.D.); the _Risálatu ’l-Qushayriyya_, or 'Qushayrite Tract,' by Abu\r\n’l-Qásim al-Qushayrí of Naysábúr († 1074 A.D.); the _Iḥyá’u ‘Ulúm\r\nal-Dín_, or 'Revivification of the Religious Sciences,' by Ghazálí (†\r\n1111 A.D.); and the _‘Awárifu ’l-Ma‘árif_, or 'Bounties of Knowledge,'\r\nby Shihábu ’l-Dín Abú Ḥafṣ ‘Umar al-Suhrawardí († 1234 A.D.)--a\r\nlist which might easily be extended. In Dogmatic Theology there is none\r\nto compare with Abú Ḥámid al-Ghazálí, surnamed 'the Proof of Islam'\r\n(_Ḥujjatu ’l-Islám_). He is a figure of such towering importance that\r\nsome detailed account of his life and opinions must be inserted in a\r\nbook like this, which professes to illustrate the history of\r\nMuḥammadan thought. Here, however, we shall only give an outline of\r\nhis biography in order to pave the way for discussion of his\r\nintellectual achievements and his far-reaching influence.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Life of Ghazálí according to the _Shadharátu ’l-Dhahab_.]\r\n\r\n  \"In this year (505 A.H. = 1111 A.D.) died the Imám, who was the\r\n  Ornament of the Faith and the Proof of Islam, Abú Ḥámid\r\n  Muḥammad ... of Ṭús, the Sháfi‘ite. His death took place on the\r\n  14th of the Latter Jumádá at Ṭábarán, a village near Ṭús. He\r\n  was then fifty-five years of age. Ghazzálí is equivalent to Ghazzál,\r\n  like ‘Aṭṭárí (for ‘Aṭṭár) and Khabbází (for Khabbáz), in\r\n  the dialect of the people of Khurásán[632]: so it is stated by the\r\n  author of the _‘Ibar_.[633] Al-Isnawí says in his\r\n  _Ṭabaqát_[634]:--Ghazzálí is an Imám by whose name breasts are\r\n  dilated and souls are revived, and in whose literary productions the\r\n  ink-horn exults and the paper quivers with joy; and at the hearing\r\n  thereof voices are hushed and heads are bowed. He was born at Ṭús\r\n  in the year 450 A.H. = 1058-1059 A.D. His father used to spin wool\r\n  (_yaghzilu ’l-ṣúf_) and sell it in his shop. On his deathbed he\r\n  committed his two sons, Ghazzálí himself and his brother Aḥmad,\r\n  to the care of a pious Ṣúfí, who taught them writing and educated\r\n  them until the money left him by their father was all spent. 'Then,'\r\n  says Ghazzálí, 'we went to the college to learn divinity (_fiqh_) so\r\n  that we might gain our livelihood.' After studying there for some\r\n  time he journeyed to Abú Naṣr al-Ismá‘ílí in Jurján, then to the\r\n  Imámu ’l-Ḥaramayn[635] at Naysábúr, under whom he studied with\r\n  such assiduity that he became the best scholastic of his\r\n  contemporaries (_ṣára anẓara ahli zamánihi_), and he lectured\r\n  _ex cathedrâ_ in his master's lifetime, and wrote books.... And on\r\n  the death of his master he set out for the Camp[636] and presented\r\n  himself to the Niẓámu ’l-Mulk, whose assembly was the\r\n  alighting-place of the learned and the destination of the leading\r\n  divines and savants; and there, as was due to his high merit, he\r\n  enjoyed the society of the principal doctors, and disputed with his\r\n  opponents and rebutted them in spite of their eminence. So the\r\n  Niẓámu ’l-Mulk inclined to him and showed him great honour, and\r\n  his name flew through the world. Then, in the year '84 (1091 A.D.)\r\n  he was called to a professorship in the Niẓámiyya College at\r\n  Baghdád, where a splendid reception awaited him. His words reached\r\n  far and wide, and his influence soon exceeded that of the Emírs and\r\n  Viziers. But at last his lofty spirit recoiled from worldly\r\n  vanities. He gave himself up to devotion and dervishhood, and set\r\n  out, in the year '88 (1095 A.D.), for the Ḥijáz.[637] On his\r\n  return from the Pilgrimage he journeyed to Damascus and made his\r\n  abode there for ten years in the minaret of the Congregational\r\n  Mosque, and composed several works, of which the _Iḥyá_ is said\r\n  to be one. Then, after visiting Jerusalem and Alexandria, he\r\n  returned to his home at Ṭús, intent on writing and worship and\r\n  constant recitation of the Koran and dissemination of knowledge and\r\n  avoidance of intercourse with men. The Vizier Fakhru ’l-Mulk,[638]\r\n  son of the Niẓámu ’l-Mulk, came to see him, and urged him by\r\n  every means in his power to accept a professorship in the\r\n  Niẓámiyya College at Naysábúr.[639] Ghazzálí consented, but after\r\n  teaching for a time, resigned the appointment and returned to end\r\n  his days in his native town.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His principal works.]\r\n\r\nBesides his _magnum opus_, the already-mentioned _Iḥyá_, in which he\r\nexpounds theology and the ethics of religion from the standpoint of the\r\nmoderate Ṣúfí school, Ghazálí wrote a great number of important\r\nworks, such as the _Munqidh mina ’l-Ḑalál_, or 'Deliverer from\r\nError,' a sort of 'Apologia pro Vitâ Suâ'; the _Kímiyá’u ’l-Sa‘ádat_, or\r\n'Alchemy of Happiness,' which was originally written in Persian; and the\r\n_Taháfutu ’l-Falásifa_, or 'Collapse of the Philosophers,' a polemical\r\ntreatise designed to refute and destroy the doctrines of Moslem\r\nphilosophy. This work called forth a rejoinder from the celebrated Ibn\r\nRushd (Averroes), who died at Morocco in 1198-1199 A.D.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shahrastání's 'Book of Religions and Sects.']\r\n\r\nHere we may notice two valuable works on the history of religion, both\r\nof which are generally known as _Kitábu ’l-Milal wa-’l-Niḥal_,[640]\r\nthat is to say, 'The Book of Religions and Sects,' by Ibn Ḥazm of\r\nCordova († 1064 A.D.) and Abu ’l-Fatḥ al-Shahrastání († 1153 A.D.).\r\nIbn Ḥazm we shall meet with again in the chapter which deals\r\nspecially with the history and literature of the Spanish Moslems.\r\nShahrastání, as he is named after his birthplace, belonged to the\r\nopposite extremity of the Muḥammadan Empire, being a native of\r\nKhurásán, the huge Eastern province bounded by the Oxus. Cureton, who\r\nedited the Arabic text of the _Kitábu ’l-Milal wa-’l-Niḥal_ (London,\r\n1842-1846), gives the following outline of its contents:--\r\n\r\n  After five introductory chapters, the author proceeds to arrange his\r\n  book into two great divisions; the one comprising the Religious, the\r\n  other the Philosophical Sects. The former of these contains an\r\n  account of the various Sects of the followers of Muḥammad, and\r\n  likewise of those to whom a true revelation had been made (the _Ahlu\r\n  ’l-Kitáb_, or 'People of the Scripture'), that is, Jews and\r\n  Christians; and of those who had a doubtful or pretended revelation\r\n  (_man lahú shubhatu ’l-Kitáb_), such as the Magi and the Manichæans.\r\n  The second division comprises an account of the philosophical\r\n  opinions of the Sabæans (Ṣábians), which are mainly set forth in\r\n  a very interesting dialogue between a Sabæan and an orthodox\r\n  Muḥammadan; of the tenets of various Greek Philosophers and some\r\n  of the Fathers of the Christian Church; and also of the\r\n  Muḥammadan doctors, more particularly of the system of Ibn Síná\r\n  or Avicenna, which the author explains at considerable length. The\r\n  work terminates with an account of the tenets of the Arabs before\r\n  the commencement of Islamism, and of the religion of the people of\r\n  India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grammar and philology.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The invention of Arabic grammar.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The philogists of Baṣra.]\r\n\r\nThe science of grammar took its rise in the cities of Baṣra and Kúfa,\r\nwhich were founded not long after Muḥammad's death, and which\r\nremained the chief centres of Arabian life and thought outside the\r\npeninsula until they were eclipsed by the great ‘Abbásid capital. In\r\nboth towns the population consisted of Bedouin Arabs, belonging to\r\ndifferent tribes and speaking many different dialects, while there were\r\nalso thousands of artisans and clients who spoke Persian as their\r\nmother-tongue, so that the classical idiom was peculiarly exposed to\r\ncorrupting influences. If the pride and delight of the Arabs in their\r\nnoble language led them to regard the maintenance of its purity as a\r\nnational duty, they were equally bound by their religious convictions to\r\ntake decisive measures for ensuring the correct pronunciation and\r\ninterpretation of that \"miracle of Divine eloquence,\" the Arabic Koran.\r\nTo this latter motive the invention of grammar is traditionally\r\nascribed. The inventor is related to have been Abu ’l-Aswad al-Du’ilí,\r\nwho died at Baṣra during the Umayyad period. \"Abu ’l-Aswad, having\r\nbeen asked where he had acquired the science of grammar, answered that\r\nhe had learned the rudiments of it from ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib. It is said\r\nthat he never made known any of the principles which he had received\r\nfrom ‘Alí till Ziyád[641] sent to him the order to compose something\r\nwhich might serve as a guide to the public and enable them to understand\r\nthe Book of God. He at first asked to be excused, but on hearing a man\r\nrecite the following passage out of the Koran, _anna ’lláha baríun mina\r\n’l-mushrikína wa-rasúluhu_,[642] which last word the reader pronounced\r\n_rasúlihi_, he exclaimed, 'I never thought that things would have come\r\nto this.' He then returned to Ziyád and said, 'I will do what you\r\nordered.'\"[643] The Baṣra school of grammarians which Abu ’l-Aswad is\r\nsaid to have founded is older than the rival school of Kúfa and\r\nsurpassed it in fame. Its most prominent representatives were Abú ‘Amr\r\nb. al-‘Alá († 770 A.D.), a diligent and profound student of the Koran,\r\nwho on one occasion burned all his collections of old poetry, &c., and\r\nabandoned himself to devotion; Khalíl b. Aḥmad, inventor of the\r\nArabic system of metres and author of the first Arabic lexicon (the\r\n_Kitábu ’l-‘Ayn_), which, however, he did not live to complete; the\r\nPersian Síbawayhi, whose Grammar, entitled 'The Book of Síbawayhi,' is\r\nuniversally celebrated; the great Humanists al-Aṣma‘í and Abú ‘Ubayda\r\nwho flourished under Hárún al-Rashid; al-Mubarrad, about a century\r\nlater, whose best-known work, the _Kámil_, has been edited by Professor\r\nWilliam Wright; his contemporary al-Sukkarí, a renowned collector and\r\ncritic of old Arabian poetry; and Ibn Durayd († 934 A.D.), a\r\ndistinguished philologist, genealogist, and poet, who received a pension\r\nfrom the Caliph Muqtadir in recognition of his services on behalf of\r\nscience, and whose principal works, in addition to the famous ode known\r\nas the _Maqṣúra_, are a voluminous lexicon (_al-Jamhara fi ’l-Lugha_)\r\nand a treatise on the genealogies of the Arab tribes (_Kitábu\r\n’l-Ishtiqáq_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The philogists of Kúfa.]\r\n\r\nAgainst these names the school of Kúfa can set al-Kisá’í, a Persian\r\nsavant who was entrusted by Hárún al-Rashíd with the education of his\r\nsons Amín and Ma’mún; al-Farrá († 822 A.D.), a pupil and compatriot of\r\nal-Kisá’í; al-Mufaḍḍal al-Ḑabbí, a favourite of the Caliph\r\nMahdí, for whom he compiled an excellent anthology of Pre-islamic poems\r\n(_al-Mufaḍḍaliyyát_), which has already been noticed[644]; Ibnu\r\n’l-Sikkít, whose outspoken partiality for the House of ‘Alí b. Abí\r\nṬálib caused him to be brutally trampled to death by the Turkish\r\nguards of the tyrant Mutawakkil (858 A.D.); and Tha‘lab, head of the\r\nKúfa school in his time († 904 A.D.), of whose rivalry with al-Mubarrad\r\nmany stories are told. A contemporary, Abú Bakr b. Abi ’l-Azhar, said in\r\none of his poems:--\r\n\r\n \"Turn to Mubarrad or to Tha‘lab, thou\r\n  That seek'st with learning to improve thy mind!\r\n  Be not a fool, like mangy camel shunned:\r\n  All human knowledge thou with them wilt find.\r\n  The science of the whole world, East and West,\r\n  In these two single doctors is combined.\"[645]\r\n\r\nReference has been made in a former chapter to some of the earliest\r\nHumanists, _e.g._, Ḥammád al-Ráwiya († 776 A.D.) and his slightly\r\nyounger contemporary, Khalaf al-Aḥmar, to their inestimable labours\r\nin rescuing the old poetry from oblivion, and to the unscrupulous\r\nmethods which they sometimes employed.[646] Among their successors, who\r\nflourished in the Golden Age of Islam, under the first ‘Abbásids, the\r\nplace of honour belongs to Abú ‘Ubayda († about 825 A.D.) and al-Asma‘í\r\n(† about 830 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú ‘Ubayda.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aṣma‘í.]\r\n\r\nAbú ‘Ubayda Ma‘mar b. al-Muthanná was of Jewish-Persian race, and\r\nmaintained in his writings the cause of the Shu‘úbites against the Arab\r\nnational party, for which reason he is erroneously described as a\r\nKhárijite.[647] The rare expressions of the Arabic language, the history\r\nof the Arabs and their conflicts were his predominant study--\"neither in\r\nheathen nor Muḥammadan times,\" he once boasted, \"have two horses met\r\nin battle but that I possess information about them and their\r\nriders\"[648]; yet, with all his learning, he was not always able to\r\nrecite a verse without mangling it; even in reading the Koran, with the\r\nbook before his eyes, he made mistakes.[649] Our knowledge of Arabian\r\nantiquity is drawn, to a large extent, from the traditions collected by\r\nhim which are preserved in the _Kitábu ’l-Aghání_ and elsewhere. He left\r\nnearly two hundred works, of which a long but incomplete catalogue\r\noccurs in the _Fihrist_ (pp. 53-54). Abú ‘Ubayda was summoned by the\r\nCaliph Hárún al-Rashíd to Baghdád, where he became acquainted with\r\nAṣma‘í. There was a standing feud between them, due in part to\r\ndifference of character[650] and in part to personal jealousies. ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Malik b. Qurayb al-Aṣma‘í was, like his rival, a native of\r\nBaṣra. Although he may have been excelled by others of his\r\ncontemporaries in certain branches of learning, none exhibited in such\r\nfine perfection the varied literary culture which at that time was so\r\nhighly prized and so richly rewarded. Whereas Abú ‘Ubayda was dreaded\r\nfor his sharp tongue and sarcastic humour, Aṣma‘í had all the\r\naccomplishments and graces of a courtier. Abú Nuwás, the first great\r\npoet of the ‘Abbásid period, said that Aṣma‘í was a nightingale to\r\ncharm those who heard him with his melodies. In court circles, where the\r\ntalk often turned on philological matters, he was a favourite guest, and\r\nthe Caliph would send for him to decide any abstruse question connected\r\nwith literature which no one present was able to answer. Of his numerous\r\nwritings on linguistic and antiquarian themes several have come down to\r\nus, _e.g._, 'The Book of Camels' (_Kitábu ’l-Ibil_), 'The Book of\r\nHorses' (_Kitábu ’l-Khayl_), and 'The Book of the Making of Man'\r\n(_Kitábu Khalqi ’l-Insán_), a treatise which shows that the Arabs of the\r\ndesert had acquired a considerable knowledge of human anatomy. His work\r\nas editor, commentator, and critic of Arabian poetry forms (it has been\r\nsaid) the basis of nearly all that has since been written on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibnu ’l-Muqaffa‘ († _circa_ 760 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Qutayba († 899 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jáḥiẓ († 869 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn ‘Abdi Rabbihi († 940 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abu ’l-Faraj al-Iṣfahání († 967 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tha‘álibí († 1037 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nBelles-lettres (_Adab_) and literary history are represented by a whole\r\nseries of valuable works. Only a few of the most important can be\r\nmentioned here, and that in a very summary manner. The Persian Rúzbih,\r\nbetter known as ‘Abdulláh Ibnu ’l-Muqaffa‘, who was put to death by\r\norder of the Caliph Manṣúr, made several translations from the\r\nPehleví or Middle-Persian literature into Arabic. We possess a specimen\r\nof his powers in the famous _Book of Kalíla and Dimna_, which is\r\nultimately derived from the Sanscrit _Fables of Bidpai_. The Arabic\r\nversion is one of the oldest prose works in that language, and is justly\r\nregarded as a model of elegant style, though it has not the pungent\r\nbrevity which marks true Arabian eloquence. Ibn Qutayba, whose family\r\ncame from Merv, held for a time the office of Cadi at Dínawar, and lived\r\nat Baghdád in the latter half of the ninth century. We have more than\r\nonce cited his 'Book of General Knowledge' (_Kitábu ’l-Ma‘árif_)[651]\r\nand his 'Book of Poetry and Poets,' (_Kitábu ’l-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_),\r\nand may add here the _Adabu ’l-Kátib_, or 'Accomplishments of the\r\nSecretary,'[652] a manual of stylistic, dealing with orthography,\r\northoepy, lexicography, and the like; and the _‘Uyúnu ’l-Akhbár_, or\r\n'Choice Histories,'[653] a work in ten chapters, each of which is\r\ndevoted to a special theme such as Government, War, Nobility,\r\nFriendship, Women, &c. ‘Amr b. Baḥr al-Jáḥiẓ of Baṣra was a\r\ncelebrated freethinker, and gave his name to a sect of the Mu‘tazilites\r\n(_al-Jáḥiẓiyya_).[654] He composed numerous books of an anecdotal\r\nand entertaining character. Ibn Khallikán singles out as his finest and\r\nmost instructive works the _Kitábu ’l-Ḥayawán_ ('Book of Animals'),\r\nand the _Kitábu ’l-Bayán wa-’l-Tabyín_ ('Book of Eloquence and\r\nExposition'), which is a popular treatise on rhetoric. It so\r\nhappens--and the fact is not altogether fortuitous--that extremely\r\nvaluable contributions to the literary history of the Arabs were made by\r\ntwo writers connected with the Umayyad House. Ibn ‘Abdi Rabbihi of\r\nCordova, who was descended from an enfranchised slave of the Spanish\r\nUmayyad Caliph, Hishám b. ‘Abd al-Raḥmán (788-796 A.D.), has left us\r\na miscellaneous anthology entitled _al-‘Iqd al-Faríd_, or 'The Unique\r\nNecklace,' which is divided into twenty-five books, each bearing the\r\nname of a different gem, and \"contains something on every subject.\"\r\nThough Abu ’l-Faraj ‘Alí, the author of the _Kitábu ’l-Aghání_, was born\r\nat Iṣfahán, he was an Arab of the Arabs, being a member of the tribe\r\nQuraysh and a lineal descendant of Marwán, the last Umayyad Caliph.\r\nComing to Baghdád, he bent all his energies to the study of Arabian\r\nantiquity, and towards the end of his life found a generous patron in\r\nal-Muhallabí, the Vizier of the Buwayhid sovereign, Mu‘izzu ’l-Dawla.\r\nHis minor works are cast in the shade by his great 'Book of Songs.' This\r\nmay be described as a history of all the Arabian poetry that had been\r\nset to music down to the author's time. It is based on a collection of\r\none hundred melodies which was made for the Caliph Hárún al-Rashíd, but\r\nto these Abu ’l-Faraj has added many others chosen by himself. After\r\ngiving the words and the airs attached to them, he relates the lives of\r\nthe poets and musicians by whom they were composed, and takes occasion\r\nto introduce a vast quantity of historical traditions and anecdotes,\r\nincluding much ancient and modern verse. It is said that the Ṣáḥib\r\nIbn ‘Abbád,[655] when travelling, used to take thirty camel-loads of\r\nbooks about with him, but on receiving the _Aghání_ he contented himself\r\nwith this one book and dispensed with all the rest.[656] The chief man\r\nof letters of the next generation was Abú Mansúr al-Tha‘álibí (the\r\nFurrier) of Naysábúr. Notwithstanding that most of his works are\r\nunscientific compilations, designed to amuse the public rather than to\r\nimpart solid instruction, his famous anthology of recent and\r\ncontemporary poets--the _Yatímatu ’l-Dahr_, or 'Solitaire of the\r\nTime'--supplies indubitable proof of his fine scholarship and critical\r\ntaste. Successive continuations of the _Yatíma_ were written by\r\nal-Bákharzí († 1075 A.D.) in the _Dumyatu ’l-Qaṣr_, or 'Statue of the\r\nPalace'; by Abu ’l-Ma‘álí al-Ḥaẓírí († 1172 A.D.) in the _Zínatu\r\n’l-Dahr_, or 'Ornament of the Time'; and by the favourite of Saladin,\r\n‘Imádu ’l-Dín al-Kátib al-Iṣfahání († 1201 A.D.), in the _Kharídatu\r\n’l-Qaṣr_, or 'Virgin Pearl of the Palace.' From the tenth century\r\nonward the study of philology proper began to decline, while on the\r\nother hand those sciences which formerly grouped themselves round\r\nphilology now became independent, were cultivated with brilliant\r\nsuccess, and in a short time reached their zenith.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: History.]\r\n\r\nThe elements of History are found (1) in Pre-islamic traditions and (2)\r\nin the _Ḥadíth_ of the Prophet, but the idea of historical\r\ncomposition on a grand scale was probably suggested to the Arabs by\r\nPersian models such as the Pehleví _Khudáy-náma_, or 'Book of Kings,'\r\nwhich Ibnu ’l-Muqaffa‘ turned into Arabic in the eighth century of our\r\nera under the title of _Siyaru Mulúki ’l-‘Ajam_, that is, 'The History\r\nof the Kings of Persia.'\r\n\r\nUnder the first head Hishám Ibnu ’l-Kalbí († 819 A.D.) and his father\r\nMuḥammad deserve particular mention as painstaking and trustworthy\r\nrecorders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Histories of the Prophet and his Companions.]\r\n\r\nHistorical traditions relating to the Prophet were put in writing at an\r\nearly date (see p. 247). The first biography of Muḥammad (_Síratu\r\nRasúli ’lláh_), compiled by Ibn Isḥáq, who died in the reign of\r\nManṣúr (768 A.D.), has come down to us only in the recension made by\r\nIbn Hishám († 834 A.D.). This work as well as those of al-Wáqidí († 823\r\nA.D.) and Ibn Sa‘d († 845 A.D.) have been already noticed.\r\n\r\nOther celebrated historians of the ‘Abbásid period are the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baládhurí.]\r\n\r\nAḥmad b. Yaḥyá al-Baládhurí († 892 A.D.), a Persian, wrote an\r\naccount of the early Muḥammadan conquests (_Kitábu Futúḥi\r\n’l-Buldán_), which has been edited by De Goeje, and an immense chronicle\r\nbased on genealogical principles, 'The Book of the Lineages of the\r\nNobles' (_Kitábu Ansábi ’l-Ashráf_), of which two volumes are\r\nextant.[657]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dínawarí.]\r\n\r\nAbú Ḥánífa Aḥmad al-Dínawarí († 895 A.D.) was also of Íránian\r\ndescent. His 'Book of Long Histories' (_Kitábu ’l-Akhbár al-Ṭiwál_)\r\ndeals largely with the national legend of Persia, and is written\r\nthroughout from the Persian point of view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ya‘qúbí.]\r\n\r\nIbn Wáḍiḥ al-Ya‘qúbí, a contemporary of Dínawarí, produced an\r\nexcellent compendium of universal history, which is specially valuable\r\nbecause its author, being a follower of the House of ‘Alí, has preserved\r\nthe ancient and unfalsified Shí‘ite tradition. His work has been edited\r\nin two volumes by Professor Houtsma (Leyden, 1883).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Annals of Ṭabarí, edited by De Goeje and other European scholars\r\n(Leyden, 1879-1898), and the Golden Meadows[658] (_Murúju ’l-Dhahab_) of\r\nMas‘údí, which Pavet de Courteille and Barbier de Meynard published with\r\na French translation (Paris, 1861-1877), have been frequently cited in\r\nthe foregoing pages; and since these two authors are not only the\r\ngreatest historians of the Muḥammadan East but also (excepting,\r\npossibly, Ibn Khaldún) the most eminent of all who devoted themselves to\r\nthis branch of Arabic literature, we must endeavour to make the reader\r\nmore closely acquainted with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṭabarí (838-923 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nAbú Ja‘far Muḥammad b. Jarír was born in 838-839 A.D. at Ámul in\r\nṬabaristán, the mountainous province lying along the south coast of\r\nthe Caspian Sea; whence the name, Ṭabarí, by which he is usually\r\nknown.[659] At this time ‘Iráq was still the principal focus of\r\nMuḥammadan culture, so that a poet could say:--\r\n\r\n \"I see a man in whom the secretarial dignity is manifest,\r\n  One who displays the brilliant culture of ‘Iráq.\"[660]\r\n\r\nThither the young Ṭabarí came to complete his education. He travelled\r\nby way of Rayy to Baghdád, visited other neighbouring towns, and\r\nextended his tour to Syria and Egypt. Although his father sent him a\r\nyearly allowance, it did not always arrive punctually, and he himself\r\nrelates that on one occasion he procured bread by selling the sleeves of\r\nhis shirt. Fortunately, at Baghdád he was introduced to ‘Ubaydulláh b.\r\nYaḥyá, the Vizier of Mutawakkil, who engaged him as tutor for his\r\nson. How long he held this post is uncertain, but he was only\r\ntwenty-three years of age when his patron went out of office. Fifteen\r\nyears later we find him, penniless once more, in Cairo (876-877 A.D.).\r\nHe soon, however, returned to Baghdád, where he passed the remainder of\r\nhis life in teaching and writing. Modest, unselfish, and simple in his\r\nhabits, he diffused his encyclopædic knowledge with an almost superhuman\r\nindustry. During forty years, it is said, he wrote forty leaves every\r\nday. His great works are the _Ta’ríkhu ’l-Rusul wa-’l-Mulúk_, or 'Annals\r\nof the Apostles and the Kings,' and his _Tafsír_, or 'Commentary on the\r\nKoran.' Both, even in their present shape, are books of enormous extent,\r\nyet it seems likely that both were originally composed on a far larger\r\nscale and were abbreviated by the author for general use. His pupils, we\r\nare told, flatly refused to read the first editions with him, whereupon\r\nhe exclaimed: \"Enthusiasm for learning is dead!\" The History of\r\nṬabarí, from the Creation to the year 302 A.H. = 915 A.D., is\r\ndistinguished by \"completeness of detail, accuracy, and the truly\r\nstupendous learning of its author that is revealed throughout, and that\r\nmakes the Annals a vast storehouse of valuable information for the\r\nhistorian as well as for the student of Islam.\"[661] It is arranged\r\nchronologically, the events being tabulated under the year (of the\r\nMuḥammadan era) in which they occurred. Moreover, it has a very\r\npeculiar form. \"Each important fact is related, if possible, by an\r\neye-witness or contemporary, whose account came down through a series of\r\nnarrators to the author. If he has obtained more than one account of a\r\nfact, with more or less important modifications, through several series\r\nof narrators, he communicates them all to the reader _in extenso_. Thus\r\nwe are enabled to consider the facts from more than one point of view,\r\nand to acquire a vivid and clear notion of them.\"[662] According to\r\nmodern ideas, Ṭabarí's compilation is not so much a history as a\r\npriceless collection of original documents placed side by side without\r\nany attempt to construct a critical and continuous narrative. At first\r\nsight one can hardly see the wood for the trees, but on closer study the\r\nessential features gradually emerge and stand out in bold relief from\r\namidst the multitude of insignificant circumstances which lend freshness\r\nand life to the whole. Ṭabarí suffered the common fate of standard\r\nhistorians. His work was abridged and popularised, the _isnáds_ or\r\nchains of authorities were suppressed, and the various parallel accounts\r\nwere combined by subsequent writers into a single version.[663] Of the\r\nAnnals, as it left the author's hands, no entire copy exists anywhere,\r\nbut many odd volumes are preserved in different parts of the world. The\r\nLeyden edition is based on these scattered MSS., which luckily comprise\r\nthe whole work with the exception of a few not very serious lacunæ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mas‘údí († 956 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n‘Alí b. Ḥusayn, a native of Baghdád, was called Mas‘údí after one of\r\nthe Prophet's Companions, ‘Abdulláh b. Mas‘úd, to whom he traced his\r\ndescent. Although we possess only a small remnant of his voluminous\r\nwritings, no better proof can be desired of the vast and various\r\nerudition which he gathered not from books alone, but likewise from long\r\ntravel in almost every part of Asia. Among other places, he visited\r\nArmenia, India, Ceylon, Zanzibar, and Madagascar, and he appears to have\r\nsailed in Chinese waters as well as in the Caspian Sea. \"My journey,\" he\r\nsays, \"resembles that of the sun, and to me the poet's verse is\r\napplicable:--\r\n\r\n \"'We turn our steps toward each different clime,\r\n  Now to the Farthest East, then West once more;\r\n  Even as the sun, which stays not his advance\r\n  O'er tracts remote that no man durst explore.'\"[664]\r\n\r\nHe spent the latter years of his life chiefly in Syria and Egypt--for he\r\nhad no settled abode--compiling the great historical works,[665] of\r\nwhich the _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_ is an epitome. As regards the motives which\r\nurged him to write, Mas‘údí declares that he wished to follow the\r\nexample of scholars and sages and to leave behind him a praiseworthy\r\nmemorial and imperishable monument. He claims to have taken a wider view\r\nthan his predecessors. \"One who has never quitted his hearth and home,\r\nbut is content with the knowledge which he can acquire concerning the\r\nhistory of his own part of the world, is not on the same level as one\r\nwho spends his life in travel and passes his days in restless\r\nwanderings, and draws forth all manner of curious and precious\r\ninformation from its hidden mine.\"[666]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_.]\r\n\r\nMas‘údí has been named the 'the Herodotus of the Arabs,' and the\r\ncomparison is not unjust.[667] His work, although it lacks the artistic\r\nunity which distinguishes that of the Greek historian, shows the same\r\neager spirit of enquiry, the same open-mindedness and disposition to\r\nrecord without prejudice all the marvellous things that he had heard or\r\nseen, the same ripe experience and large outlook on the present as on\r\nthe past. It is professedly a universal history beginning with the\r\nCreation and ending at the Caliphate of Muṭí‘, in 947 A.D., but no\r\ndescription can cover the immense range of topics which are discussed\r\nand the innumerable digressions with which the author delights or\r\nirritates his readers, as the case may be.[668] Thus, to pick a few\r\nexamples at random, we find a dissertation on tides (vol. i, p. 244); an\r\naccount of the _tinnín_ or sea-serpent (_ibid._, p. 267); of\r\npearl-fishing in the Persian Gulf (_ibid._, p. 328); and of the\r\nrhinoceros (_ibid._, p. 385). Mas‘údí was a keen student and critic of\r\nreligious beliefs, on which subject he wrote several books.[669] The\r\n_Murúju ’l-Dhahab_ supplies many valuable details regarding the\r\nMuḥammadan sects, and also regarding the Zoroastrians and Ṣábians. There\r\nis a particularly interesting report of a meeting which took place\r\nbetween Aḥmad b. Ṭúlún, the governor of Egypt (868-877 A.D.), and an\r\naged Copt, who, after giving his views as to the source of the Nile and\r\nthe construction of the Pyramids, defended his faith (Christianity) on\r\nthe ground of its manifest errors and contradictions, arguing that its\r\nacceptance, in spite of these, by so many peoples and kings was decisive\r\nevidence of its truth.[670] Mas‘údí's account of the Caliphs is chiefly\r\nremarkable for the characteristic anecdotes in which it abounds. Instead\r\nof putting together a methodical narrative he has thrown off a brilliant\r\nbut unequal sketch of public affairs and private manners, of social life\r\nand literary history. Only considerations of space have prevented me\r\nfrom enriching this volume with not a few pages which are as lively and\r\npicturesque as any in Suetonius. His last work, the _Kitábu ’l-Tanbíh\r\nwa-’l-Ishráf_ ('Book of Admonition and Recension'),[671] was intended to\r\ntake a general survey of the field which had been more fully traversed\r\nin his previous compositions, and also to supplement them when it seemed\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor historians.]\r\n\r\nWe must pass over the minor historians and biographers of this\r\nperiod--for example, ‘Utbí († 1036 A.D.), whose _Kitáb al-Yamíní_\r\ncelebrates the glorious reign of Sultan Mahmúd of Ghazna; Khaṭíb of\r\nBaghdád († 1071 A.D.), who composed a history of the eminent men of that\r\ncity; ‘Imádu ’l-Dín of Iṣfahán († 1201 A.D.), the biographer of\r\nSaladin; Ibnu ’l-Qiftí († 1248 A.D.), born at Qifṭ (Coptos) in Upper\r\nEgypt, whose lives of the philosophers and scientists have only come\r\ndown to us in a compendium entitled _Ta’ríkhu ’l-Ḥukamá_; Ibnu\r\n’l-Jawzí († 1200 A.D.), a prolific writer in almost every branch of\r\nliterature, and his grandson, Yúsuf († 1257 A.D.)--generally called\r\nSibṭ Ibn al-Jawzí--author of the _Mir’átu ’l-Zamán_, or 'Mirror of\r\nthe Time'; Ibn Abí Uṣaybi‘a († 1270 A.D.), whose history of\r\nphysicians, the _‘Uyúnu ’l-Anbá_, has been edited by A. Müller (1884);\r\nand the Christian, Jirjis (George) al-Makín († 1273 A.D.), compiler of a\r\nuniversal chronicle--named the _Majmú‘ al-Mubárak_--of which the second\r\npart, from Muḥammad to the end of the ‘Abbásid dynasty, was rendered\r\ninto Latin by Erpenius in 1625.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibnu ’l-Athír († 1234 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nA special notice, brief though it must be, is due to ‘Izzu ’l-Dín Ibnu\r\n’l-Athír († 1234 A.D.). He was brought up at Mosul in Mesopotamia, and\r\nafter finishing his studies in Baghdád, Jerusalem, and Syria, he\r\nreturned home and devoted himself to reading and literary composition.\r\nIbn Khallikán, who knew him personally, speaks of him in the highest\r\nterms both as a man and as a scholar. \"His great work, the _Kámil_,[672]\r\nembracing the history of the world from the earliest period to the year\r\n628 of the Hijra (1230-1231 A.D.), merits its reputation as one of the\r\nbest productions of the kind.\"[673] Down to the year 302 A.H. the author\r\nhas merely abridged the Annals of Ṭabarí with occasional additions\r\nfrom other sources. In the first volume he gives a long account of the\r\nPre-islamic battles (_Ayyámu ’l-‘Arab_) which is not found in the\r\npresent text of Ṭabarí; but De Goeje, as I learn from Professor\r\nBevan, thinks that this section was included in Ṭabarí's original\r\ndraft and was subsequently struck out. Ibnu ’l-Athír was deeply versed\r\nin the science of Tradition, and his _Usdu ’l-Ghába_ ('Lions of the\r\nJungle') contains biographies of 7,500 Companions of the Prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographers.]\r\n\r\nAn immense quantity of information concerning the various countries and\r\npeoples of the ‘Abbásid Empire has been preserved for us by the Moslem\r\ngeographers, who in many cases describe what they actually witnessed and\r\nexperienced in the course of their travels, although they often help\r\nthemselves liberally and without acknowledgment from the works of their\r\npredecessors. The following list, which does not pretend to be\r\nexhaustive, may find a place here.[674]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Khurdádbih.]\r\n\r\n1. The Persian Ibn Khurdádbih (first half of ninth century) was\r\npostmaster in the province of Jibál, the Media of the ancients. His\r\n_Kitábu ’l-Masálik wa-’l-Mamálik_ ('Book of the Roads and Countries'),\r\nan official guide-book, is the oldest geographical work in Arabic that\r\nhas come down to us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iṣṭakhrí and Ibn Ḥawqal.]\r\n\r\n2. Abú Isḥáq al-Fárisí a native of Persepolis (Iṣṭakhr)--on\r\nthis account he is known as Iṣṭakhrí--wrote a book called\r\n_Masáliku ’l-Mamálik_ ('Routes of the Provinces'), which was afterwards\r\nrevised and enlarged by Ibn Ḥawqal. Both works belong to the second\r\nhalf of the tenth century and contain \"a careful description of each\r\nprovince in turn of the Muslim Empire, with the chief cities and notable\r\nplaces.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muqaddasí.]\r\n\r\n3. Al-Muqaddasí (or al-Maqdisí), _i.e._, 'the native of the Holy City',\r\nwas born at Jerusalem in 946 A.D. In his delightful book entitled\r\n_Aḥsanu ’l-Taqásím fí ma‘rifati ’l-Aqálím_ he has gathered up the\r\nfruits of twenty years' travelling through the dominions of the\r\nCaliphate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Yáqút.]\r\n\r\n4. Omitting the Spanish Arabs, Bakrí, Idrísí, and Ibn Jubayr, all of\r\nwhom flourished in the eleventh century, we come to the greatest of\r\nMoslem geographers, Yáqút b. ‘Abdalláh (1179-1229 A.D.). A Greek by\r\nbirth, he was enslaved in his childhood and sold to a merchant of\r\nBaghdád. His master gave him a good education and frequently sent him on\r\ntrading expeditions to the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. After being\r\nenfranchised in consequence of a quarrel with his benefactor, he\r\nsupported himself by copying and selling manuscripts. In 1219-1220 A.D.\r\nhe encountered the Tartars, who had invaded Khwárizm, and \"fled as naked\r\nas when he shall be raised from the dust of the grave on the day of the\r\nresurrection.\" Further details of his adventurous life are recorded in\r\nthe interesting notice by Ibn Khallikán.[675] His great Geographical\r\nDictionary (_Mu‘jamu ’l-Buldán_) has been edited in six volumes by\r\nWüstenfeld (Leipzig, 1866), and is described by Mr. Le Strange as \"a\r\nstorehouse of geographical information, the value of which it would be\r\nimpossible to over-estimate.\" We possess a useful epitome of it, made\r\nabout a century later, viz., the _Maráṣidu ’l-Iṭṭilá‘_. Among\r\nthe few other extant works of Yáqút, attention maybe called to the\r\n_Mushtarik_--a lexicon of places bearing the same name--and the _Mu‘jamu\r\n’l-Udabá_, or 'Dictionary of Littérateurs,' which has been edited by\r\nProfessor Margoliouth for the Trustees of the Gibb Memorial Fund.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The foreign sciences.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Translations from the Greek.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ma’mún's encouragement of the New Learning.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the philosophical and exact sciences the Moslems naturally\r\nderived their ideas and material from Greek culture, which had\r\nestablished itself in Egypt, Syria, and Western Asia since the time of\r\nAlexander's conquests. When the Syrian school of Edessa was broken up by\r\necclesiastical dissensions towards the end of the fifth century of our\r\nera, the expelled savants took refuge in Persia at the Sásánian court,\r\nand Khusraw Anúshirwán, or Núshírwán (531-578 A.D.)--the same monarch\r\nwho welcomed the Neo-platonist philosophers banished from Athens by\r\nJustinian--founded an Academy at Jundé-shápúr in Khúzistán, where Greek\r\nmedicine and philosophy continued to be taught down to ‘Abbásid days.\r\nAnother centre of Hellenism was the city of Ḥarrán in Mesopotamia.\r\nIts inhabitants, Syrian heathens who generally appear in Muḥammadan\r\nhistory under the name of 'Ṣábians,' spoke Arabic with facility and\r\ncontributed in no small degree to the diffusion of Greek wisdom. The\r\nwork of translation was done almost entirely by Syrians. In the\r\nmonasteries of Syria and Mesopotamia the writings of Aristotle, Galen,\r\nPtolemy, and other ancient masters were rendered with slavish fidelity,\r\nand these Syriac versions were afterwards retranslated into Arabic. A\r\nbeginning was made under the Umayyads, who cared little for Islam but\r\nwere by no means indifferent to the claims of literature, art, and\r\nscience. An Umayyad prince, Khálid b. Yazíd, procured the translation of\r\nGreek and Coptic works on alchemy, and himself wrote three treatises on\r\nthat subject. The accession of the ‘Abbásids gave a great impulse to\r\nsuch studies, which found an enlightened patron in the Caliph Manṣúr.\r\nWorks on logic and medicine were translated from the Pehleví by Ibnu\r\n’l-Muqaffa‘ († about 760 A.D.) and others. It is, however, the splendid\r\nreign of Ma’mún (813-833 A.D.) that marks the full vigour of this\r\nOriental Renaissance. Ma’mún was no ordinary man. Like a true Persian,\r\nhe threw himself heart and soul into theological speculations and used\r\nthe authority of the Caliphate to enforce a liberal standard of\r\northodoxy. His interest in science was no less ardent. According to a\r\nstory told in the _Fihrist_,[676] he dreamed that he saw the venerable\r\nfigure of Aristotle seated on a throne, and in consequence of this\r\nvision he sent a deputation to the Roman Emperor (Leo the Armenian) to\r\nobtain scientific books for translation into Arabic. The Caliph's\r\nexample was followed by private individuals. Three brothers,\r\nMuḥammad, Aḥmad, and Ḥasan, known collectively as the Banú\r\nMúsá, \"drew translators from distant countries by the offer of ample\r\nrewards[677] and thus made evident the marvels of science. Geometry,\r\nengineering, the movements of the heavenly bodies, music, and astronomy\r\nwere the principal subjects to which they turned their attention; but\r\nthese were only a small number of their acquirements.\"[678] Ma’mún\r\ninstalled them, with Yaḥyá b. Abí Manṣúr and other scientists, in\r\nthe House of Wisdom (_Baytu ’l-Ḥikma_) at Baghdád, an institution\r\nwhich comprised a well-stocked library and an astronomical observatory.\r\nAmong the celebrated translators of the ninth century, who were\r\nthemselves conspicuous workers in the new field, we can only mention the\r\nChristians Qusṭá b. Lúqá and Ḥunayn b. Isḥáq, and the Ṣábian\r\nThábit b. Qurra. It does not fall within the scope of this volume to\r\nconsider in detail the achievements of the Moslems in science and\r\nphilosophy. That in some departments they made valuable additions to\r\nexisting knowledge must certainly be granted, but these discoveries\r\ncount for little in comparison with the debt which we owe to the Arabs\r\nas pioneers of learning and bringers of light to mediæval Europe.[679]\r\nMeanwhile it is only possible to enumerate a few of the most eminent\r\nphilosophers and scientific men who lived during the ‘Abbásid age. The\r\nreader will observe that with rare exceptions they were of foreign\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe leading spirits in philosophy were:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kindí.]\r\n\r\n1. Ya‘qúb b. Isḥáq al-Kindí, a descendant of the princely family of\r\nKinda (see p. 42). He was distinguished by his contemporaries with the\r\ntitle _Faylasúfu ’l-‘Arab_, 'The Philosopher of the Arabs.' He\r\nflourished in the first half of the ninth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fárábí.]\r\n\r\n2. Abú Naṣr al-Fárábí († 950 A.D.), of Turkish race, a native of\r\nFáráb in Transoxania. The later years of his life were passed at Aleppo\r\nunder the patronage of Sayfu ’l-Dawla. He devoted himself to the study\r\nof Aristotle, whom Moslems agree with Dante in regarding as \"il maestro\r\ndi color che sanno.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Síná.]\r\n\r\n3. Abú ‘Alí Ibn Síná (Avicenna), born of Persian parents at Kharmaythan,\r\nnear Bukhárá, in the year 980 A.D. As a youth he displayed extraordinary\r\ntalents, so that \"in the sixteenth year of his age physicians of the\r\nhighest eminence came to read medicine with him and to learn those modes\r\nof treatment which he had discovered by his practice.\"[680] He was no\r\nquiet student, like Fárábí, but a pleasure-loving, adventurous man of\r\nthe world who travelled from court to court, now in favour, now in\r\ndisgrace, and always writing indefatigably. His system of philosophy, in\r\nwhich Aristotelian and Neo-platonic theories are combined with Persian\r\nmysticism, was well suited to the popular taste, and in the East it\r\nstill reigns supreme. His chief works are the _Shifá_ (Remedy) on\r\nphysics, metaphysics, &c., and a great medical encyclopædia entitled the\r\n_Qánún_ (Canon). Avicenna died in 1037 A.D.\r\n\r\n4. The Spanish philosophers, Ibn Bájja (Avempace), Ibn Ṭufayl, and\r\nIbn Rushd (Averroes), all of whom flourished in the twelfth century\r\nafter Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medicine, Astronomy, and Mathematics.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bírúní 973-1048 A.D.]\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious name beside Avicenna in the history of Arabian\r\nmedicine is Abú Bakr al-Rází (Rhazes), a native of Rayy, near Teheran (†\r\n923 or 932 A.D.). Jábir b. Ḥayyán of Tarsus († about 780 A.D.)--the\r\nGeber of European writers--won equal renown as an alchemist. Astronomy\r\nwent hand in hand with astrology. The reader may recognise al-Farghání,\r\nAbú Ma‘shar of Balkh († 885 A.D.) and al-Battání, a Ṣábian of\r\nḤarrán († 929 A.D.), under the names of Alfraganus, Albumaser, and\r\nAlbategnius, by which they became known in the West. Abú ‘Abdalláh\r\nal-Khwárizmí, who lived in the Caliphate of Ma’mún, was the first of a\r\nlong line of mathematicians. In this science, as also in Medicine and\r\nAstronomy, we see the influence of India upon Muḥammadan\r\ncivilisation--an influence, however, which, in so far as it depended on\r\nliterary sources, was more restricted and infinitely less vital than\r\nthat of Greece. Only a passing reference can be made to Abú Rayḥán\r\nal-Bírúní, a native of Khwárizm (Khiva), whose knowledge of the\r\nsciences, antiquities, and customs of India was such as no Moslem had\r\never equalled. His two principal works, the _Áthár al-Báqiya_, or\r\n'Surviving Monuments,' and the _Ta’ríkhu ’l-Hind_, or 'History of\r\nIndia,' have been edited and translated into English by Dr. Sachau.[681]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Fihrist_.]\r\n\r\nSome conception of the amazing intellectual activity of the Moslems\r\nduring the earlier part of the ‘Abbásid period, and also of the enormous\r\nlosses which Arabic literature has suffered through the destruction of\r\nthousands of books that are known to us by nothing beyond their titles\r\nand the names of their authors, may be gained from the _Fihrist_, or\r\n'Index' of Muḥammad b. Isḥáq b. Abí Ya‘qúb al-Nadím al-Warráq\r\nal-Baghdádí († 995 A.D.). Regarding the compiler we have no further\r\ninformation than is conveyed in the last two epithets attached to his\r\nname: he was a copyist of MSS., and was connected with Baghdád either by\r\nbirth or residence; add that, according to his own statement (p. 349, l.\r\n14 sqq.), he was at Constantinople (_Dáru ’l-Rúm_) in 988 A.D., the same\r\nyear in which his work was composed. He may possibly have been related\r\nto the famous musician, Isḥáq b. Ibráhím al-Nadím of Mosul († 849-850\r\nA.D.), but this has yet to be proved. At any rate we owe to his industry\r\na unique conspectus of the literary history of the Arabs to the end of\r\nthe fourth century after the Flight. The _Fihrist_ (as the author\r\nexplains in his brief Preface) is \"an Index of the books of all nations,\r\nArabs and foreigners alike, which are extant in the Arabic language and\r\nscript, on every branch of knowledge; comprising information as to their\r\ncompilers and the classes of their authors, together with the\r\ngenealogies of those persons, the dates of their birth, the length of\r\ntheir lives, the times of their death, the places to which they\r\nbelonged, their merits and their faults, since the beginning of every\r\nscience that has been invented down to the present epoch: namely, the\r\nyear 377 of the Hijra.\" As the contents of the _Fihrist_ (which\r\nconsiderably exceed the above description) have been analysed in detail\r\nby G. Flügel (_Z.D.M.G._, vol. 13, p. 559 sqq.) and set forth in tabular\r\nform by Professor Browne in the first volume of his _Literary History of\r\nPersia_,[682] I need only indicate the general arrangement and scope of\r\nthe work. It is divided into ten discourses (_maqálát_), which are\r\nsubdivided into a varying number of sections (_funún_). Ibnu ’l-Nadím\r\ndiscusses, in the first place, the languages, scripts, and sacred books\r\nof the Arabs and other peoples, the revelation of the Koran, the order\r\nof its chapters, its collectors, redactors, and commentators. Passing\r\nnext to the sciences which, as we have seen, arose from study of the\r\nKoran and primarily served as handmaids to theology, he relates the\r\norigin of Grammar, and gives an account of the different schools of\r\ngrammarians with the treatises which they wrote. The third discourse\r\nembraces History, Belles-Lettres, Biography, and Genealogy; the fourth\r\ntreats of Poetry, ancient and modern. Scholasticism (_Kalám_) forms the\r\nsubject of the following chapter, which contains a valuable notice of\r\nthe Ismá‘ílís and their founder, ‘Abdulláh b. Maymún, as also of the\r\ncelebrated mystic, Ḥusayn b. Manṣúr al-Ḥalláj. From these and\r\nmany other names redolent of heresy the author returns to the orthodox\r\nschools of Law--the Málikites, Ḥanafites, Sháfi‘ites and\r\nẒáhirites; then to the jurisconsults of the Shí‘a, &c. The seventh\r\ndiscourse deals with Philosophy and 'the Ancient Sciences,' under which\r\nhead we find some curious speculations concerning their origin and\r\nintroduction to the lands of Islam; a list of translators and the books\r\nwhich they rendered into Arabic; an account of the Greek philosophers\r\nfrom Thales to Plutarch, with the names of their works that were known\r\nto the Moslems; and finally a literary survey of the remaining sciences,\r\nsuch as Mathematics, Music, Astronomy, and Medicine. Here, by an abrupt\r\ntransition, we enter the enchanted domain of Oriental fable--the _Hazár\r\nAfsán_, or Thousand Tales, Kalíla and Dimna, the Book of Sindbád, and\r\nthe legends of Rustam and Isfandiyár; works on sorcery, magic,\r\nconjuring, amulets, talismans, and the like. European savants have long\r\nrecognised the importance of the ninth discourse,[683] which is devoted\r\nto the doctrines and writings of the Ṣábians and the Dualistic sects\r\nfounded by Manes, Bardesanes, Marcion, Mazdak, and other heresiarchs.\r\nThe author concludes his work with a chapter on the Alchemists\r\n(_al-Kímiyá’ún_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nORTHODOXY, FREE-THOUGHT, AND MYSTICISM\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Abbásids and Islam.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of theologians.]\r\n\r\nWe have already given some account of the great political revolution\r\nwhich took place under the ‘Abbásid dynasty, and we have now to consider\r\nthe no less vital influence of the new era in the field of religion. It\r\nwill be remembered that the House of ‘Abbás came forward as champions of\r\nIslam and of the oppressed and persecuted Faithful. Their victory was a\r\ntriumph for the Muḥammadan over the National idea. \"They wished, as\r\nthey said, to revive the dead Tradition of the Prophet. They brought the\r\nexperts in Sacred Law from Medína, which had hitherto been their home,\r\nto Baghdád, and always invited their approbation by taking care that\r\neven political questions should be treated in legal form and decided in\r\naccordance with the Koran and the Sunna. In reality, however, they used\r\nIslam only to serve their own interest. They tamed the divines at their\r\ncourt and induced them to sanction the most objectionable measures. They\r\nmade the pious Opposition harmless by leading it to victory. With the\r\ndownfall of the Umayyads it had gained its end and could now rest in\r\npeace.\"[684] There is much truth in this view of the matter, but\r\nnotwithstanding the easy character of their religion, the ‘Abbásid\r\nCaliphs were sincerely devoted to the cause of Islam and zealous to\r\nmaintain its principles in public life. They regarded themselves as the\r\nsovereign defenders of the Faith; added the Prophet's mantle\r\n(_al-burda_) to those emblems of Umayyad royalty, the sceptre and the\r\nseal; delighted in the pompous titles which their flatterers conferred\r\non them, _e.g._, 'Vicegerent of God,' 'Sultan of God upon the Earth,'\r\n'Shadow of God,' &c.; and left no stone unturned to invest themselves\r\nwith the attributes of theocracy, and to inspire their subjects with\r\nveneration.[685] Whereas the Umayyad monarchs ignored or crushed\r\nMuḥammadan sentiment, and seldom made any attempt to conciliate the\r\nleading representatives of Islam, the ‘Abbásids, on the other hand, not\r\nonly gathered round their throne all the most celebrated theologians of\r\nthe day, but also showed them every possible honour, listened\r\nrespectfully to their counsel, and allowed them to exert a commanding\r\ninfluence on the administration of the State.[686] When Málik b. Anas\r\nwas summoned by the Caliph Hárún al-Rashíd, who wished to hear him\r\nrecite traditions, Málik replied, \"People come to seek knowledge.\" So\r\nHárún went to Málik's house, and leaned against the wall beside him.\r\nMálik said, \"O Prince of the Faithful, whoever honours God, honours\r\nknowledge.\" Al-Rashíd arose and seated himself at Malik's feet and spoke\r\nto him and heard him relate a number of traditions handed down from the\r\nApostle of God. Then he sent for Sufyán b. ‘Uyayna, and Sufyán came to\r\nhim and sat in his presence and recited traditions to him. Afterwards\r\nal-Rashíd said, \"O Málik, we humbled ourselves before thy knowledge, and\r\nprofited thereby, but Sufyán's knowledge humbled itself to us, and we\r\ngot no good from it.\"[687] Many instances might be given of the high\r\nfavour which theologians enjoyed at this time, and of the lively\r\ninterest with which religious topics were debated by the Caliph and his\r\ncourtiers. As the Caliphs gradually lost their temporal sovereignty, the\r\ninfluence of the _‘Ulamá_--the doctors of Divinity and Law--continued to\r\nincrease, so that ere long they formed a privileged class, occupying in\r\nIslam a position not unlike that of the priesthood in mediæval\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to discuss the religious phenomena of the ‘Abbásid\r\nperiod under the following heads:--\r\n\r\nI. Rationalism and Free-thought.\r\n\r\nII. The Orthodox Reaction and the rise of Scholastic Theology.\r\n\r\nIII. The Ṣúfí Mysticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rationalism and Free-thought.]\r\n\r\nI. The first century of ‘Abbásid rule was marked, as we have seen, by a\r\ngreat intellectual agitation. All sorts of new ideas were in the air. It\r\nwas an age of discovery and awakening. In a marvellously brief space the\r\ndiverse studies of Theology, Law, Medicine, Philosophy, Mathematics,\r\nAstronomy, and Natural Science attained their maturity, if not their\r\nhighest development. Even if some pious Moslems looked askance at the\r\nforeign learning and its professors, an enlightened spirit generally\r\nprevailed. People took their cue from the court, which patronised, or at\r\nleast tolerated,[688] scientific research as well as theological\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mu‘tazilites and their opponents.]\r\n\r\nThese circumstances enabled the Mu‘tazilites (see p. 222 sqq.) to\r\npropagate their liberal views without hindrance, and finally to carry\r\ntheir struggle against the orthodox party to a successful issue. It was\r\nthe same conflict that divided Nominalists and Realists in the days of\r\nThomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Occam. As often happens when momentous\r\nprinciples are at stake, the whole controversy between Reason and\r\nRevelation turned on a single question--\"Is the Koran created or\r\nuncreated?\" In other terms, is it the work of God or the Word of God?\r\nAccording to orthodox belief, it is uncreated and has existed with God\r\nfrom all eternity, being in its present form merely a transcript of the\r\nheavenly archetype.[689] Obviously this conception of the Koran as the\r\ndirect and literal Word of God left no room for exercise of the\r\nunderstanding, but required of those who adopted it a dumb faith and a\r\nblind fatalism. There were many to whom the sacrifice did not seem too\r\ngreat. The Mu‘tazilites, on the contrary, asserted their intellectual\r\nfreedom. It was possible, they said, to know God and distinguish good\r\nfrom evil without any Revelation at all. They admitted that the Koran\r\nwas God's work, in the sense that it was produced by a divinely inspired\r\nProphet, but they flatly rejected its deification. Some went so far as\r\nto criticise the 'inimitable' style, declaring that it could be\r\nsurpassed in beauty and eloquence by the art of man.[690]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rationalism adopted and put in force by the Caliph Ma’mún.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mutawakkil returns to orthodoxy.]\r\n\r\nThe Mu‘tazilite controversy became a burning question in the reign of\r\nMa’mún (813-833 A.D.), a Caliph whose scientific enthusiasm and keen\r\ninterest in religious matters we have already mentioned. He did not\r\ninherit the orthodoxy of his father, Hárún al-Rashíd; and it was\r\nbelieved that he was at heart a _zindíq_. His liberal tendencies would\r\nhave been wholly admirable if they had not been marred by excessive\r\nintolerance towards those who held opposite views to his own. In 833\r\nA.D., the year of his death, he promulgated a decree which bound all\r\nMoslems to accept the Mu‘tazilite doctrine as to the creation of the\r\nKoran on pain of losing their civil rights, and at the same time he\r\nestablished an inquisition (_miḥna_) in order to obtain the assent of\r\nthe divines, judges, and doctors of law. Those who would not take the\r\ntest were flogged and threatened with the sword. After Ma’mún's death\r\nthe persecution still went on, although it was conducted in a more\r\nmoderate fashion. Popular feeling ran strongly against the Mu‘tazilites.\r\nThe most prominent figure in the orthodox camp was the Imám Aḥmad b.\r\nḤanbal, who firmly resisted the new dogma from the first. \"But for\r\nhim,\" says the Sunnite historian, Abu ’l-Maḥásin, \"the beliefs of a\r\ngreat number would have been corrupted.\"[691] Neither threats nor\r\nentreaties could shake his resolution, and when he was scourged by\r\ncommand of the Caliph Mu‘taṣim, the palace was in danger of being\r\nwrecked by an angry mob which had assembled outside to hear the result\r\nof the trial. The Mu‘tazilite dogma remained officially in force until\r\nit was abandoned by the Caliph Wáthiq and once more declared heretical\r\nby the cruel and bigoted Mutawakkil (847 A.D.). From that time to this\r\nthe victorious party have sternly suppressed every rationalistic\r\nmovement in Islam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The end of the Mu‘tazilites.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Steiner, the original Mu‘tazilite heresy arose in the bosom\r\nof Islam, independently of any foreign influence, but, however that may\r\nbe, its later development was largely affected by Greek philosophy. We\r\nneed not attempt to follow the recondite speculations of Abú Hudhayl\r\nal-‘Alláf († about 840 A.D.) of his contemporaries, al-Naẓẓám,\r\nBishr b. al-Mu‘tamir, and others, and of the philosophical schools of\r\nBaṣra and Baghdád in which the movement died away. Vainly they sought\r\nto replace the Muḥammadan idea of God as will by the Aristotelian\r\nconception of God as law. Their efforts to purge the Koran of\r\nanthropomorphism made no impression on the faithful, who ardently hoped\r\nto see God in Paradise face to face. What they actually achieved was\r\nlittle enough. Their weapons of logic and dialectic were turned against\r\nthem with triumphant success, and scholastic theology was founded on the\r\nruins of Rationalism. Indirectly, however, the Mu‘tazilite principles\r\nleavened Muḥammadan thought to a considerable extent and cleared the\r\nway for other liberal movements, like the Fraternity of the _Ikhwánu\r\n’l-Ṣafá_, which endeavoured to harmonise authority with reason, and\r\nto construct a universal system of religious philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ikhwánu ’l-Ṣafá.]\r\n\r\nThese 'Brethren of Purity,'[692] as they called themselves, compiled a\r\ngreat encyclopædic work in fifty tractates (_Rasá’il_). Of the authors,\r\nwho flourished at Baṣra towards the end of the tenth century, five\r\nare known to us by name: viz., Abú Sulaymán Muḥammad b. Ma‘shar\r\nal-Bayusti or al-Muqaddasí (Maqdisí), Abu ’l-Ḥasan ‘Alí b. Hárún\r\nal-Zanjání, Abú Aḥmad al-Mihrajání, al-‘Awfí, and Zayd b. Rifá‘a.\r\n\"They formed a society for the pursuit of holiness, purity, and truth,\r\nand established amongst themselves a doctrine whereby they hoped to win\r\nthe approval of God, maintaining that the Religious Law was defiled by\r\nignorance and adulterated by errors, and that there was no means of\r\ncleansing and purifying it except philosophy, which united the wisdom of\r\nfaith and the profit of research. They held that a perfect result would\r\nbe reached if Greek philosophy were combined with Arabian religion.\r\nAccordingly they composed fifty tracts on every branch of philosophy,\r\ntheoretical as well as practical, added a separate index, and entitled\r\nthem the 'Tracts of the Brethren of Purity' (_Rasá’ilu Ikhwán\r\nal-Ṣafá_). The authors of this work concealed their names, but\r\ncirculated it among the booksellers and gave it to the public. They\r\nfilled their pages with devout phraseology, religious parables,\r\nmetaphorical expressions, and figurative turns of style.\"[693] Nearly\r\nall the tracts have been translated into German by Dieterici, who has\r\nalso drawn up an epitome of the whole encyclopædia in his _Philosophie\r\nder Araber im X Jahrhundert_. It would take us too long to describe the\r\nsystem of the _Ikhwán_, but the reader will find an excellent account of\r\nit in Stanley Lane-Poole's _Studies in a Mosque_, 2nd ed., p. 176 sqq.\r\nThe view has recently been put forward that the Brethren of Purity were\r\nin some way connected with the Ismá‘ílí propaganda, and that their\r\neclectic idealism represents the highest teaching of the Fátimids,\r\nCarmathians, and Assassins. Strong evidence in support of this theory is\r\nsupplied by a MS. of the Bibliothèque Nationale (No. 2309 in De Slane's\r\nCatalogue), which contains, together with fragments of the _Rasá’il_, a\r\nhitherto unknown tract entitled the _Jámi‘a_ or 'Summary.'[694] The\r\nlatter purports to be the essence and crown of the fifty _Rasá’il_, it\r\nis manifestly Ismá‘ílite in character, and, assuming that it is genuine,\r\nwe may, I think, agree with the conclusions which its discoverer, M. P.\r\nCasanova, has stated in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The doctrines of the Brethren of Purity identical with\r\n  the esoteric philosophy of the Ismá‘ílís.]\r\n\r\n  \"Surtout je crois être dans le vrai en affirmant que les doctrines\r\n  philosophiques des Ismaïliens sont contenues tout entières dans les\r\n  Epîtres des Frères de la Pureté. Et c'est ce qui explique 'la\r\n  séduction extraordinaire que la doctrine exerçait sur des hommes\r\n  sérieux.'[695] En y ajoutant la croyance en l'_imám caché_ (_al-imám\r\n  al-mastúr_) qui doit apparaître un jour pour établir le bonheur\r\n  universel, elle réalisait la fusion de toutes les doctrines\r\n  idéalistes, du messianisme et du platonisme. Tant que l'imám restait\r\n  caché, il s'y mêlait encore une saveur de mystère qui attachait les\r\n  esprits les plus élevés.... En tous cas, on peut affirmer que les\r\n  Carmathes et les Assassins ont été profondément calomniés quand ils\r\n  ont été accusés par leurs adversaires d'athéisme et de débauche. Le\r\n  fetwa d'Ibn Taimiyyah, que j'ai cité plus haut, prétend que leur\r\n  dernier degré dans l'initiation (_al-balágh al-akbar_) est la\r\n  négation même du Créateur. Mais la _djâmi‘at_ que nous avons\r\n  découverte est, comme tout l'indique, le dernier degré de la science\r\n  des Frères de la Pureté et des Ismaïliens; il n'y a rien de fondé\r\n  dans une telle accusation. La doctrine apparait très pure, très\r\n  élevée, très simple même: je repète que c'est une sorte de\r\n  panthéisme mécaniste et esthétique qui est absolument opposé au\r\n  scepticisme et au matérialisme, car il repose sur l'harmonie\r\n  générale de toutes les parties du monde, harmonie voulue par le\r\n  Créateur parce qu'elle est la beauté même.\r\n\r\n  \"Ma conclusion sera que nous avons là un exemple de plus dans\r\n  l'histoire d'une doctrine très pure et très élevée en théorie,\r\n  devenue, entre les mains des fanatiques et des ambitieux, une source\r\n  d'actes monstrueux et méritant l'infamie qui est attachée a ce nom\r\n  historique d'Assassins.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the Mu‘tazilites, we hear much of another class of heretics who\r\nare commonly grouped together under the name of _Zindíqs_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Zindíqs_.]\r\n\r\n\"It is well known,\" says Goldziher,[696] \"that the earliest persecution\r\nwas directed against those individuals who managed more or less adroitly\r\nto conceal under the veil of Islam old Persian religious ideas.\r\nSometimes indeed they did not consider any disguise to be necessary, but\r\nopenly set up dualism and other Persian or Manichæan doctrines, and the\r\npractices associated therewith, against the dogma and usage of Islam.\r\nSuch persons were called _Zindíqs_, a term which comprises different\r\nshades of heresy and hardly admits of simple definition. Firstly, there\r\nare the old Persian families incorporated in Islam who, following the\r\nsame path as the Shu‘úbites, have a _national interest_ in the revival\r\nof Persian religious ideas and traditions, and from this point of view\r\nreact against the _Arabian_ character of the Muḥammadan system. Then,\r\non the other hand, there are freethinkers, who oppose in particular the\r\nstubborn dogma of Islam, reject _positive religion_, and acknowledge\r\nonly the moral law. Amongst the latter there is developed a monkish\r\nasceticism extraneous to Islam and ultimately traceable to Buddhistic\r\ninfluences.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution of _Zindíqs_.]\r\n\r\nThe ‘Abbásid Government, which sought to enforce an official standard of\r\nbelief, was far less favourable to religious liberty than the Umayyads\r\nhad been. Orthodox and heretic alike fell under its ban. While Ma’mún\r\nharried pious Sunnites, his immediate predecessors raised a hue and cry\r\nagainst _Zindíqs_. The Caliph Mahdí distinguished himself by an\r\norganised persecution of these enemies of the faith. He appointed a\r\nGrand Inquisitor (_Ṣáḥibu ’l-Zanádiqa_[697] or _‘Arífu\r\n’l-Zanádiqa_) to discover and hunt them down. If they would not recant\r\nwhen called upon, they were put to death and crucified, and their\r\nbooks[698] were cut to pieces with knives.[699] Mahdí's example was\r\nfollowed by Hádí and Hárún al-Rashíd. Some of the ‘Abbásids, however,\r\nwere less severe. Thus Khaṣíb, Manṣúr's physician, was a _Zindíq_\r\nwho professed Christianity,[700] and in the reign of Ma’mún it became\r\nthe mode to affect Manichæan opinions as a mark of elegance and\r\nrefinement.[701]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bashshár b. Burd.]\r\n\r\nThe two main types of _zandaqa_ which have been described above are\r\nillustrated in the contemporary poets, Bashshár b. Burd and Ṣáliḥ\r\nb. ‘Abd al-Quddús. Bashshár was born stone-blind. The descendant of a\r\nnoble Persian family--though his father, Burd, was a slave--he cherished\r\nstrong national sentiments and did not attempt to conceal his sympathy\r\nwith the Persian clients (_Mawálí_), whom he was accused of stirring up\r\nagainst their Arab lords. He may also have had leanings towards\r\nZoroastrianism, but Professor Bevan has observed that there is no real\r\nevidence for this statement,[702] though Zoroastrian or Manichæan views\r\nare probably indicated by the fact that he used to dispute with a number\r\nof noted Moslem theologians in Baṣra, _e.g._, with Wáṣil b.\r\n‘Aṭá, who started the Mu‘tazilite heresy, and ‘Amr b. ‘Ubayd. He and\r\nṢáliḥ b. ‘Abd al-Quddús were put to death by the Caliph Mahdí in\r\nthe same year (783 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṣáliḥ b. ‘Abd al-Quddús.]\r\n\r\nThis Ṣáliḥ belonged by birth or affiliation to the Arab tribe of\r\nAzd. Of his life we know little beyond the circumstance that he was for\r\nsome time a street-preacher at Baṣra, and afterwards at Damascus. It\r\nis possible that his public doctrine was thought dangerous, although the\r\npreachers as a class were hand in glove with the Church and did not,\r\nlike the Lollards, denounce religious abuses.[703] His extant poetry\r\ncontains nothing heretical, but is wholly moral and didactic in\r\ncharacter. We have seen, however, in the case of Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya, that\r\nMuḥammadan orthodoxy was apt to connect 'the philosophic mind' with\r\npositive unbelief; and Ṣáliḥ appears to have fallen a victim to\r\nthis prejudice. He was accused of being a dualist (_thanawí_), _i.e._, a\r\nManichæan. Mahdí, it is said, conducted his examination in person, and\r\nat first let him go free, but the poet's fate was sealed by his\r\nconfession that he was the author of the following verses:--\r\n\r\n \"The greybeard will not leave what in the bone is bred\r\n  Until the dark tomb covers him with earth o'erspread;\r\n  For, tho' deterred awhile, he soon returns again\r\n  To his old folly, as the sick man to his pain.\"[704]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí on the _Zindíqs_.]\r\n\r\nAbu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí, himself a bold and derisive critic of\r\nMuḥammadan dogmas, devotes an interesting section of his _Risálatu\r\n’l-Ghufrán_ to the _Zindíqs_, and says many hard things about them,\r\nwhich were no doubt intended to throw dust in the eyes of a suspicious\r\naudience. The wide scope of the term is shown by the fact that he\r\nincludes under it the pagan chiefs of Quraysh; the Umayyad Caliph Walíd\r\nb. Yazíd; the poets Di‘bil, Abú Nuwás, Bashshár, and Ṣáliḥ b. ‘Abd\r\nal-Quddús; Abú Muslim, who set up the ‘Abbásid dynasty; the Persian\r\nrebels, Bábak and Mázyár; Afshín, who after conquering Bábak was starved\r\nto death by the Caliph Mu‘taṣim; the Carmathian leader al-Jannábí;\r\nIbnu ’l-Ráwandí, whose work entitled the _Dámigh_ was designed to\r\ndiscredit the 'miraculous' style of the Koran; and Ḥusayn b.\r\nManṣúr al-Ḥalláj, the Ṣúfí martyr. Most of these, one may\r\nadmit, fall within Abu ’l-‘Alá’s definition of the _Zindíqs_: \"they\r\nacknowledge neither prophet nor sacred book.\" The name _Zindíq_, which\r\nis applied by Jáḥiẓ († 868 A.D.) to certain wandering monks,[705]\r\nseems in the first instance to have been used of Manes (_Mání_) and his\r\nfollowers, and is no doubt derived, as Professor Bevan has suggested,\r\nfrom the _zaddíqs_, who formed an elect class in the Manichæan\r\nhierarchy.[706]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Orthodox Reaction.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-ash‘arí.]\r\n\r\nII. The official recognition of Rationalism as the State religion came\r\nto an end on the accession of Mutawakkil in 847 A.D. The new Caliph, who\r\nowed his throne to the Turkish Prætorians, could not have devised a\r\nsurer means of making himself popular than by standing forward as the\r\navowed champion of the faith of the masses. He persecuted impartially\r\nJews, Christians, Mu‘tazilites, Shí‘ites, and Ṣúfís--every one, in\r\nshort, who diverged from the narrowest Sunnite orthodoxy. The Vizier Ibn\r\nAbí Du’ád, who had shown especial zeal in his conduct of the Mu‘tazilite\r\nInquisition, was disgraced, and the bulk of his wealth was confiscated.\r\nIn Baghdád the followers of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal went from house to\r\nhouse terrorising the citizens,[707] and such was their fanatical temper\r\nthat when Ṭabarí, the famous divine and historian, died in 923 A.D.,\r\nthey would not allow his body to receive the ordinary rites of\r\nburial.[708] Finally, in the year 935 A.D., the Caliph Ráḍí issued an\r\nedict denouncing them in these terms: \"Ye assert that your ugly,\r\nill-favoured faces are in the likeness of the Lord of Creation, and that\r\nyour vile exterior resembles His, and ye speak of the hand, the fingers,\r\nthe feet, the golden shoes, and the curly hair (of God), and of His\r\ngoing up to Heaven and of His coming down to Earth.... The Commander of\r\nthe Faithful swears a binding oath that unless ye refrain from your\r\ndetestable practices and perverse tenets he will lay the sword to your\r\nnecks and the fire to your dwellings.\"[709] Evidently the time was ripe\r\nfor a system which should reconcile the claims of tradition and reason,\r\navoiding the gross anthropomorphism of the extreme Ḥanbalites on the\r\none side and the pure rationalism of the advanced Mu‘tazilites (who were\r\nstill a power to be reckoned with) on the other. It is a frequent\r\nexperience that great intellectual or religious movements rising slowly\r\nand invisibly, in response, as it were, to some incommunicable want,\r\nsuddenly find a distinct interpreter with whose name they are henceforth\r\nassociated for ever. The man, in this case, was Abu ’l-Ḥasan\r\nal-Ash‘arí. He belonged to a noble and traditionally orthodox family of\r\nYemenite origin. One of his ancestors was Abú Músá al-Ash‘arí, who, as\r\nthe reader will recollect, played a somewhat inglorious part in the\r\narbitration between ‘Alí and Mu‘áwiya after the battle of\r\nṢiffín.[710] Born in 873-874 A.D. at Baṣra, a city renowned for\r\nits scientific and intellectual fertility, the young Abu ’l-Ḥasan\r\ndeserted the faith of his fathers, attached himself to the freethinking\r\nschool, and until his fortieth year was the favourite pupil and intimate\r\nfriend of al-Jubbá’í († 915 A.D.), the head of the Mu‘tazilite party at\r\nthat time. He is said to have broken with his teacher in consequence of\r\na dispute as to whether God always does what is best (_aṣlaḥ_) for\r\nHis creatures. The story is related as follows by Ibn Khallikán (De\r\nSlane's translation, vol. ii, p. 669 seq.):--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Story of the three brothers.]\r\n\r\n  Ash‘arí proposed to Jubbá’í the case of three brothers, one of whom\r\n  was a true believer, virtuous and pious; the second an infidel, a\r\n  debauchee and a reprobate; and the third an infant: they all died,\r\n  and Ash‘arí wished to know what had become of them. To this Jubbá’í\r\n  answered: \"The virtuous brother holds a high station in Paradise;\r\n  the infidel is in the depths of Hell, and the child is among those\r\n  who have obtained salvation.\"[711] \"Suppose now,\" said Ash‘arí,\r\n  \"that the child should wish to ascend to the place occupied by his\r\n  virtuous brother, would he be allowed to do so?\" \"No,\" replied\r\n  Jubbá’í, \"it would be said to him: 'Thy brother arrived at this\r\n  place through his numerous works of obedience towards God, and thou\r\n  hast no such works to set forward.'\" \"Suppose then,\" said Ash‘arí,\r\n  \"that the child say: 'That is not my fault; you did not let me live\r\n  long enough, neither did you give me the means of proving my\r\n  obedience.'\" \"In that case,\" answered Jubbá’í, \"the Almighty would\r\n  say: 'I knew that if I had allowed thee to live, thou wouldst have\r\n  been disobedient and incurred the severe punishment (of Hell); I\r\n  therefore acted for thy advantage.'\" \"Well,\" said Ash‘arí, \"and\r\n  suppose the infidel brother were to say: 'O God of the universe!\r\n  since you knew what awaited him, you must have known what awaited\r\n  me; why then did you act for his advantage and not for mine?\"\r\n  Jubbá’í had not a word to offer in reply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ash‘arí's conversion to orthodoxy.]\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Ash‘arí made a public recantation. One Friday, while\r\nsitting (as his biographer relates) in the chair from which he taught in\r\nthe great mosque of Baṣra, he cried out at the top of his voice:\r\n\"They who know me know who I am: as for those who do not know me I will\r\ntell them. I am ‘Alí b. Ismá‘íl al-Ash‘arí, and I used to hold that the\r\nKoran was created, that the eyes of men shall not see God, and that we\r\nourselves are the authors of our evil deeds. Now I have returned to the\r\ntruth; I renounce these opinions, and I undertake to refute the\r\nMu‘tazilites and expose their infamy and turpitude.\"[712]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ash‘arí as the founder of Scholastic Theology.]\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes possess little or no historical value, but illustrate\r\nthe fact that Ash‘arí, having learned all that the Mu‘tazilites could\r\nteach him and having thoroughly mastered their dialectic, turned against\r\nthem with deadly force the weapons which they had put in his hands. His\r\ndoctrine on the subject of free-will may serve to exemplify the method\r\nof _Kalám_ (Disputation) by which he propped up the orthodox creed.[713]\r\nHere, as in other instances, Ash‘arí took the central path--_medio\r\ntutissimus_--between two extremes. It was the view of the early Moslem\r\nChurch--a view justified by the Koran and the Apostolic Traditions--that\r\neverything was determined in advance and inscribed, from all eternity,\r\non the Guarded Tablet (_al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfúẓ_), so that men had no\r\nchoice but to commit the actions decreed by destiny. The Mu‘tazilites,\r\non the contrary, denied that God could be the author of evil and\r\ninsisted that men's actions were free. Ash‘arí, on his part, declared\r\nthat all actions are created and predestined by God, but that men have a\r\ncertain subordinate power which enables them to acquire the actions\r\npreviously created, although it produces no effect on the actions\r\nthemselves. Human agency, therefore, was confined to this process of\r\nacquisition (_kasb_). With regard to the anthropomorphic passages in the\r\nKoran, Ash‘arí laid down the rule that such expressions as \"_The\r\nMerciful has settled himself upon His throne_,\" \"_Both His hands are\r\nspread out_,\" &c., must be taken in their obvious sense without asking\r\n'How?' (_bilá kayfa_). Spitta saw in the system of Ash‘arí a successful\r\nrevolt of the Arabian national spirit against the foreign ideas which\r\nwere threatening to overwhelm Islam,[714] a theory which does not agree\r\nwith the fact that most of the leading Ash‘arites were Persians.[715]\r\nVon Kremer came nearer the mark when he said \"Ash‘arí's victory was\r\nsimply a clerical triumph,\"[716] but it was also, as Schreiner has\r\nobserved, \"a victory of reflection over unthinking faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe victory, however, was not soon or easily won.[717] Many of the\r\northodox disliked the new Scholasticism hardly less than the old\r\nRationalism. Thus it is not surprising to read in the _Kámil_ of Ibnu\r\n’l-Athír under the year 456 A.H. = 1063-4 A.D., that Alp Arslán's\r\nVizier, ‘Amídu ’l-Mulk al-Kundurí, having obtained his master's\r\npermission to have curses pronounced against the Ráfiḍites (Shí‘ites)\r\nfrom the pulpits of Khurásán, included the Ash‘arites in the same\r\nmalediction, and that the famous Ash‘arite doctors, Abu ’l-Qásim\r\nal-Qushayrí and the Imámu ’l-Ḥaramayn Abu ’l-Ma‘álí al-Juwayní, left\r\nthe country in consequence. The great Niẓámu ’l-Mulk exerted himself\r\non behalf of the Ash‘arites, and the Niẓámiyya College, which he\r\nfounded in Baghdád in the year 1067 A.D., was designed to propagate\r\ntheir system of theology. But the man who stamped it with the impression\r\nof his own powerful genius, fixed its ultimate form, and established it\r\nas the universal creed of orthodox Islam, was Abú Ḥámid al-Ghazálí\r\n(1058-1111 A.D.). We have already sketched the outward course of his\r\nlife, and need only recall that he lectured at Baghdád in the\r\nNiẓámiyya College for four years (1091-1095 A.D.).[718] At the end of\r\nthat time he retired from the world as a Ṣúfí, and so brought to a\r\ncalm and fortunate close the long spiritual travail which he has himself\r\ndescribed in the _Munqidh mina ’l-Ḑalál_, or 'Deliverer from\r\nError.'[719] We must now attempt to give the reader some notion of this\r\nwork, both on account of its singular psychological interest and because\r\nGhazálí's search for religious truth exercised, as will shortly appear,\r\na profound and momentous influence upon the future history of\r\nMuḥammadan thought. It begins with these words:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ghazálí's autobiography.]\r\n\r\n  \"In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise be to\r\n  God by the praise of whom every written or spoken discourse is\r\n  opened! And blessings on Muḥammad, the Elect, the Prophet and\r\n  Apostle, as well as on his family and his companions who lead us\r\n  forth from error! To proceed: You have asked me, O my brother in\r\n  religion, to explain to you the hidden meanings and the ultimate\r\n  goal of the sciences, and the secret bane of the different\r\n  doctrines, and their inmost depths. You wish me to relate all that I\r\n  have endured in seeking to recover the truth from amidst the\r\n  confusion of sects with diverse ways and paths, and how I have dared\r\n  to raise myself from the abyss of blind belief in authority to the\r\n  height of discernment. You desire to know what benefits I have\r\n  derived in the first place from Scholastic Theology, and what I have\r\n  appropriated, in the second place, from the methods of the\r\n  Ta‘límites[720] who think that truth can be attained only by\r\n  submission to the authority of an Imám; and thirdly, my reasons for\r\n  spurning the systems of philosophy; and, lastly, why I have accepted\r\n  the tenets of Ṣúfiism: you are anxious, in short, that I should\r\n  impart to you the essential truths which I have learned in my\r\n  repeated examination of the (religious) opinions of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nIn a very interesting passage, which has been translated by Professor\r\nBrowne, Ghazálí tells how from his youth upward he was possessed with an\r\nintense thirst for knowledge, which impelled him to study every form of\r\nreligion and philosophy, and to question all whom he met concerning the\r\nnature and meaning of their belief.[721] But when he tried to\r\ndistinguish the true from the false, he found no sure test. He could not\r\ntrust the evidence of his senses. The eye sees a shadow and declares it\r\nto be without movement; or a star, and deems it no larger than a piece\r\nof gold. If the senses thus deceive, may not the mind do likewise?\r\nPerhaps our life is a dream full of phantom thoughts which we mistake\r\nfor realities--until the awakening comes, either in moments of ecstasy\r\nor at death. \"For two months,\" says Ghazálí, \"I was actually, though not\r\navowedly, a sceptic.\" Then God gave him light, so that he regained his\r\nmental balance and was able to think soundly. He resolved that this\r\nfaculty must guide him to the truth, since blind faith once lost never\r\nreturns. Accordingly, he set himself to examine the foundations of\r\nbelief in four classes of men who were devoted to the search for truth,\r\nnamely, Scholastic Theologians, Ismá‘ílís (_Bátiniyya_), Philosophers,\r\nand Ṣúfís. For a long while he had to be content with wholly negative\r\nresults. Scholasticism was, he admitted, an excellent purge against\r\nheresy, but it could not cure the disease from which he was suffering.\r\nAs for the philosophers, all of them--Materialists (_Dahriyyún_),\r\nNaturalists (_Ṭabí‘iyyún_), and Theists (_Iláhiyyún_)--\"are branded\r\nwith infidelity and impiety.\" Here, as often in his discussion of the\r\nphilosophical schools, Ghazálí's religious instinct breaks out. We\r\ncannot imagine him worshipping at the shrine of pure reason any more\r\nthan we can imagine Herbert Spencer at Lourdes. He next turned to the\r\nTa‘límites (Doctrinists) or Báṭinites (Esoterics), who claimed that\r\nthey knew the truth, and that its unique source was the infallible Imám.\r\nBut when he came to close quarters with these sectaries, he discovered\r\nthat they could teach him nothing, and their mysterious Imám vanished\r\ninto space. Ṣúfiism, therefore, was his last hope. He carefully\r\nstudied the writings of the mystics, and as he read it became clear to\r\nhim that now he was on the right path. He saw that the higher stages of\r\nṢúfiism could not be learned by study, but must be realised by actual\r\nexperience, that is, by rapture, ecstasy, and moral transformation.\r\nAfter a painful struggle with himself he resolved to cast aside all his\r\nworldly ambition and to live for God alone. In the month of Dhu\r\n’l-Qa‘da, 488 A.H. (November, 1095 A.D.), he left Baghdád and wandered\r\nforth to Syria, where he found in the Ṣúfí discipline of prayer,\r\npraise, and meditation the peace which his soul desired.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan B. Macdonald, to whom we owe the best and fullest life of\r\nGhazálí that has yet been written, sums up his work and influence in\r\nIslam under four heads[722]:--\r\n\r\n_First_, he led men back from scholastic labours upon theological dogmas\r\nto living contact with, study and exegesis of, the Word and the\r\nTraditions.\r\n\r\n_Second_, in his preaching and moral exhortations he re-introduced the\r\nelement of fear.\r\n\r\n_Third_, it was by his influence that Ṣúfiism attained a firm and\r\nassured position within the Church of Islam.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, he brought philosophy and philosophical theology within the\r\nrange of the ordinary mind.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ghazálí's work and influence.]\r\n\r\n  \"Of these four phases of al-Ghazzālī's work,\" says Macdonald,\r\n  \"the first and third are undoubtedly the most important. He made his\r\n  mark by leading Islam back to its fundamental and historical facts,\r\n  and by giving a place in its system to the emotional religious life.\r\n  But it will have been noticed that in none of the four phases was he\r\n  a pioneer. He was not a scholar who struck out a new path, but a man\r\n  of intense personality who entered on a path already trodden and\r\n  made it the common highway. We have here his character. Other men\r\n  may have been keener logicians, more learned theologians, more\r\n  gifted saints; but he, through his personal experiences, had\r\n  attained so overpowering a sense of the divine realities that the\r\n  force of his character--once combative and restless, now narrowed\r\n  and intense--swept all before it, and the Church of Islam entered on\r\n  a new era of its existence.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṣúfiism in the ‘Abbásid period.]\r\n\r\nIII. We have traced the history of Mysticism in Islam from the ascetic\r\nmovement of the first century, in which it originated, to a point where\r\nit begins to pass beyond the sphere of Muḥammadan influence and to enter\r\non a strange track, of which the Prophet assuredly never dreamed,\r\nalthough the Ṣúfís constantly pretend that they alone are his true\r\nfollowers. I do not think it can be maintained that Ṣúfiism of the\r\ntheosophical and speculative type, which we have now to consider, is\r\nmerely a development of the older asceticism and quietism which have\r\nbeen described in a former chapter. The difference between them is\r\nessential and must be attributed in part, as Von Kremer saw,[723] to the\r\nintrusion of some extraneous, non-Islamic, element. As to the nature of\r\nthis new element there are several conflicting theories, which have been\r\nso clearly and fully stated by Professor Browne in his _Literary History\r\nof Persia_ (vol. i, p. 418 sqq.) that I need not dwell upon them here.\r\nBriefly it is claimed--\r\n\r\n(_a_) That Ṣúfiism owes its inspiration to Indian philosophy, and\r\nespecially to the Vedanta.\r\n\r\n(_b_) That the most characteristic ideas in Ṣúfiism are of Persian\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n(_c_) That these ideas are derived from Neo-platonism.\r\n\r\nInstead of arguing for or against any of the above theories, all of\r\nwhich, in my opinion, contain a measure of truth, I propose in the\r\nfollowing pages to sketch the historical evolution of the Ṣúfí\r\ndoctrine as far as the materials at my disposal will permit. This, it\r\nseems to me, is the only possible method by which we may hope to arrive\r\nat a definite conclusion as to its origin. Since mysticism in all ages\r\nand countries is fundamentally the same, however it may be modified by\r\nits peculiar environment, and by the positive religion to which it\r\nclings for support, we find remote and unrelated systems showing an\r\nextraordinarily close likeness and even coinciding in many features of\r\nverbal expression. Such resemblances can prove little or nothing unless\r\nthey are corroborated by evidence based on historical grounds. Many\r\nwriters on Ṣúfiism have disregarded this principle; hence the\r\nconfusion which long prevailed. The first step in the right direction\r\nwas made by Adalbert Merx,[724] who derived valuable results from a\r\nchronological examination of the sayings of the early Ṣúfís. He did\r\nnot, however, carry his researches beyond Abú Sulaymán al-Dárání († 830\r\nA.D.), and confined his attention almost entirely to the doctrine,\r\nwhich, according to my view, should be studied in connection with the\r\nlives, character, and nationality of the men who taught it.[725] No\r\ndoubt the origin and growth of mysticism in Islam, as in all other\r\nreligions, _ultimately_ depended on general causes and conditions, not\r\non external circumstances. For example, the political anarchy of the\r\nUmayyad period, the sceptical tendencies of the early ‘Abbásid age, and\r\nparticularly the dry formalism of Moslem theology could not fail to\r\nprovoke counter-movements towards quietism, spiritual authority, and\r\nemotional faith. But although Ṣúfiism was not called into being by\r\nany impulse from without (this is too obvious to require argument), the\r\ninfluences of which I am about to speak have largely contributed to make\r\nit what it is, and have coloured it so deeply that no student of the\r\nhistory of Ṣúfiism can afford to neglect them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ma‘rúf al-Karkhí († 815 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eighth century of our era the influence of new\r\nideas is discernible in the sayings of Ma‘rúf al-Karkhí († 815 A.D.), a\r\ncontemporary of Fuḍayl b. ‘Iyáḍ and Shaqíq of Balkh. He was born\r\nin the neighbourhood of Wásiṭ, one of the great cities of\r\nMesopotamia, and the name of his father, Fírúz, or Fírúzán, shows that\r\nhe had Persian blood in his veins. Ma‘rút was a client (_mawlá_) of the\r\nShí‘ite Imám, ‘Alí b. Músá al-Riḍá, in whose presence he made\r\nprofession of Islam; for he had been brought up as a Christian (such is\r\nthe usual account), or, possibly, as a Ṣábian. He lived during the\r\nreign of Hárún al-Rashíd in the Karkh quarter of Baghdád, where he\r\ngained a high reputation for saintliness, so that his tomb in that city\r\nis still an object of veneration. He is described as a God-intoxicated\r\nman, but in this respect he is not to be compared with many who came\r\nafter him. Nevertheless, he deserves to stand at the head of the\r\nmystical as opposed to the ascetic school of Ṣúfís. He defined\r\nṢúfiism as \"the apprehension of Divine realities and renunciation of\r\nhuman possessions.\"[726] Here are a few of his sayings:--\r\n\r\n \"Love is not to be learned from men; it is one of God's gifts and\r\n  comes of His grace.\r\n\r\n \"The Saints of God are known by three signs: their thought is of\r\n  God, their dwelling is with God, and their business is in God.\r\n\r\n \"If the gnostic (_‘árif_) has no bliss, yet he himself is in every\r\n    bliss.\r\n\r\n \"When you desire anything of God, swear to Him by me.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these last words, which Ma‘rúf addressed to his pupil Sarí\r\nal-Saqaṭí, it is manifest that he regarded himself as being in the\r\nmost intimate communion with God.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abú Sulaymán al-Dárání († 830 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nAbú Sulaymán († 830 A.D.), the next great name in the Ṣúfí\r\nbiographies, was also a native of Wásiṭ, but afterwards emigrated to\r\nSyria and settled at Dárayá (near Damascus), whence he is called\r\n'al-Dárání.' He developed the doctrine of gnosis (_ma‘rifat_). Those who\r\nare familiar with the language of European mystics--_illuminatio_,\r\n_oculus cordis_, &c.--will easily interpret such sayings as these:--\r\n\r\n  \"None refrains from the lusts of this world save him in whose heart\r\n  there is a light that keeps him always busied with the next world.\r\n\r\n  \"When the gnostic's spiritual eye is opened, his bodily eye is shut:\r\n  they see nothing but Him.\r\n\r\n  \"If Gnosis were to take visible form, all that looked thereon would\r\n  die at the sight of its beauty and loveliness and goodness and\r\n  grace, and every brightness would become dark beside the splendour\r\n  thereof.[727]\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Gnosis is nearer to silence than to speech.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dhu ’l-Nún al-Misrí († 860 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nWe now come to Dhu ’l-Nún al-Misrí († 860 A.D.), whom the Ṣúfís\r\nthemselves consider to be the primary author of their doctrine.[728]\r\nThat he at all events was among the first of those who helped to give it\r\npermanent shape is a fact which is amply attested by the collection of\r\nhis sayings preserved in ‘Aṭṭár's _Memoirs of the Saints_ and in\r\nother works of the same kind.[729] It is clear that the theory of\r\ngnosis, with which he deals at great length, was the central point in\r\nhis system; and he seems to have introduced the doctrine that true\r\nknowledge of God is attained only by means of ecstasy (_wajd_). \"The man\r\nthat knows God best,\" he said, \"is the one most lost in Him.\" Like\r\nDionysius, he refused to make any positive statements about the Deity.\r\n\"Whatever you imagine, God is the contrary of that.\" Divine love he\r\nregarded as an ineffable mystery which must not be revealed to the\r\nprofane. All this is the very essence of the later Ṣúfiism. It is\r\ntherefore desirable to ascertain the real character of Dhu ’l-Nún and\r\nthe influences to which he was subjected. The following account gives a\r\nbrief summary of what I have been able to discover; fuller details will\r\nbe found in the article mentioned above.\r\n\r\nHis name was Abu ’l-Fayḍ Thawbán b. Ibráhím, Dhu ’l-Nún (He of the\r\nFish) being a sobriquet referring to one of his miracles, and his father\r\nwas a native of Nubia, or of Ikhmím in Upper Egypt. Ibn Khallikán\r\ndescribes Dhu ’l-Nún as 'the nonpareil of his age' for learning,\r\ndevotion, communion with the Divinity (_ḥál_), and acquaintance with\r\nliterature (_adab_); adding that he was a philosopher (_ḥakím_) and\r\nspoke Arabic with elegance. The people of Egypt, among whom he lived,\r\nlooked upon him as a _zindíq_ (freethinker), and he was brought to\r\nBaghdád to answer this charge, but after his death he was canonised. In\r\nthe _Fihrist_ he appears among \"the philosophers who discoursed on\r\nalchemy,\" and Ibnu ’l-Qifṭí brackets him with the famous occultist\r\nJábir b. Ḥayyán. He used to wander (as we learn from Mas‘údí)[730]\r\namidst the ruined Egyptian monuments, studying the inscriptions and\r\nendeavouring to decipher the mysterious figures which were thought to\r\nhold the key to the lost sciences of antiquity. He also dabbled in\r\nmedicine, which, like Paracelsus, he combined with alchemy and magic.\r\n\r\nLet us see what light these facts throw upon the origin of the Ṣúfí\r\ntheosophy. Did it come to Egypt from India, Persia, or Greece?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of theosophical Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the time, place, and circumstances in which it arose, and\r\nhaving regard to the character of the man who bore a chief part in its\r\ndevelopment, we cannot hesitate, I think, to assert that it is largely a\r\nproduct of Greek speculation. Ma‘rúf al-Karkhí, Abú Sulaymán al-Dárání,\r\nand Dhu ’l-Nún al-Miṣrí all three lived and died in the period (786-861\r\nA.D.) which begins with the accession of Hárún al-Rashíd and is\r\nterminated by the death of Mutawakkil. During these seventy-five years\r\nthe stream of Hellenic culture flowed unceasingly into the Moslem world.\r\nInnumerable works of Greek philosophers, physicians, and scientists were\r\ntranslated and eagerly studied. Thus the Greeks became the teachers of\r\nthe Arabs, and the wisdom of ancient Greece formed, as has been shown in\r\na preceding chapter, the basis of Muḥammadan science and philosophy. The\r\nresults are visible in the Mu‘tazilite rationalism as well as in the\r\nsystem of the _Ikhwánu ’l-Ṣafá_. But it was not through literature alone\r\nthat the Moslems were imbued with Hellenism. In ‘Iráq, Syria, and Egypt\r\nthey found themselves on its native soil, which yielded, we may be sure,\r\na plentiful harvest of ideas--Neo-platonic, Gnostical, Christian,\r\nmystical, pantheistic, and what not? In Mesopotamia, the heart of the\r\n‘Abbásid Empire, dwelt a strange people, who were really Syrian\r\nheathens, but who towards the beginning of the ninth century assumed the\r\nname of Ṣábians in order to protect themselves from the persecution with\r\nwhich they were threatened by the Caliph Ma’mún. At this time, indeed,\r\nmany of them accepted Islam or Christianity, but the majority clung to\r\ntheir old pagan beliefs, while the educated class continued to profess a\r\nreligious philosophy which, as it is described by Shahrastání and other\r\nMuḥammadan writers, is simply the Neo-platonism of Proclus and\r\nIamblichus. To return to Dhu ’l-Nún, it is incredible that a mystic and\r\nnatural philosopher living in the first half of the ninth century in\r\nEgypt should have derived his doctrine directly from India. There may be\r\nIndian elements in Neo-platonism and Gnosticism, but this possibility\r\ndoes not affect my contention that the immediate source of the Ṣúfí\r\ntheosophy is to be sought in Greek and Syrian speculation. To define its\r\norigin more narrowly is not, I think, practicable in the present state\r\nof our knowledge. Merx, however, would trace it to Dionysius, the\r\nPseudo-Areopagite, or rather to his master, a certain \"Hierotheus,\" whom\r\nFrothingham has identified with the Syrian mystic, Stephen bar Sudaili\r\n(_circa_ 500 A.D.). Dionysius was of course a Christian Neo-platonist.\r\nHis works certainly laid the foundations of mediæval mysticism in\r\nEurope, and they were also popular in the East at the time when Ṣúfiism\r\narose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṣúfiism composed of many different elements.]\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the various current theories as to the origin of\r\nṢúfiism, I said that in my opinion they all contained a measure of\r\ntruth. No single cause will account for a phenomenon so widely spread\r\nand so diverse in its manifestations. Ṣúfiism has always been thoroughly\r\neclectic, absorbing and transmuting whatever 'broken lights' fell across\r\nits path, and consequently it gained adherents amongst men of the most\r\nopposite views--theists and pantheists, Mu‘tazilites and Scholastics,\r\nphilosophers and divines. We have seen what it owed to Greece, but the\r\nPerso-Indian elements are not to be ignored. Although the theory \"that\r\nit must be regarded as the reaction of the Aryan mind against a Semitic\r\nreligion imposed on it by force\" is inadmissible--Dhu ’l-Nún, for\r\nexample, was a Copt or Nubian--the fact remains that there was at the\r\ntime a powerful anti-Semitic reaction, which expressed itself, more or\r\nless consciously, in Ṣúfís of Persian race. Again, the literary\r\ninfluence of India upon Muḥammadan thought before 1000 A.D. was greatly\r\ninferior to that of Greece, as any one can see by turning over the pages\r\nof the _Fihrist_; but Indian religious ideas must have penetrated into\r\nKhurásán and Eastern Persia at a much earlier period.\r\n\r\nThese considerations show that the question as to the origin of Ṣúfiism\r\ncannot be answered in a definite and exclusive way. None of the rival\r\ntheories is completely true, nor is any of them without a partial\r\njustification. The following words of Dr. Goldziher should be borne in\r\nmind by all who are interested in this subject:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Goldziher on the character of Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\n  \"Ṣúfiism cannot be looked upon as a regularly organised sect within\r\n  Islam. Its dogmas cannot be compiled into a regular system. It\r\n  manifests itself in different shapes in different countries. We find\r\n  divergent tendencies, according to the spirit of the teaching of\r\n  distinguished theosophists who were founders of different schools,\r\n  the followers of which may be compared to Christian monastic orders.\r\n  The influence of different environments naturally affected the\r\n  development of Ṣúfiism. Here we find mysticism, there asceticism the\r\n  prevailing thought.\"[731]\r\n\r\nThe four principal foreign sources of Ṣúfiism are undoubtedly\r\nChristianity, Neo-platonism, Gnosticism, and Indian asceticism and\r\nreligious philosophy. I shall not attempt in this place to estimate\r\ntheir comparative importance, but it should be clearly understood that\r\nthe speculative and theosophical side of Ṣúfiism, which, as we have\r\nseen, was first elaborated in ‘Iráq, Syria, and Egypt, bears\r\nunmistakable signs of Hellenistic influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Báyazíd of Bisṭám.]\r\n\r\nThe early Ṣúfís are particularly interested in the theory of mystical\r\nunion (_faná wa-baqá_) and often use expressions which it is easy to\r\nassociate with pantheism, yet none of them can fairly be called a\r\npantheist in the true sense. The step from theosophy to pantheism was\r\nnot, I think, made either by Ḥalláj († 922 A.D.) or by the celebrated\r\nAbú Yazíd, in Persian Báyazíd († 874-75 A.D.), of Bisṭám, a town in the\r\nprovince of Qúmis situated near the south-eastern corner of the Caspian\r\nSea. While his father, Surúshán, was a Zoroastrian, his master in\r\nṢúfiism seems to have been connected with Sind (Scinde), where Moslem\r\ngovernors had been installed since 715 A.D. Báyazíd carried the\r\nexperimental doctrine of _faná_ (dying to self) to its utmost limit, and\r\nhis language is tinged with the peculiar poetic imagery which was\r\nafterwards developed by the great Ṣúfí of Khurásán, Abú Sa‘íd b. Abi\r\n’l-Khayr († 1049 A.D.). I can give only a few specimens of his sayings.\r\nTheir genuineness is not above suspicion, but they serve to show that if\r\nthe theosophical basis of Ṣúfiism is distinctively Greek, its mystical\r\nextravagances are no less distinctively Oriental.\r\n\r\n  \"Creatures are subject to 'states' (_aḥwál_), but the gnostic has no\r\n  'state,' because his vestiges are effaced and his essence is\r\n  annihilated by the essence of another, and his traces are lost in\r\n  another's traces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"I went from God to God until they cried from me in me, 'O Thou I!'\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Nothing is better for Man than to be without aught, having no\r\n  asceticism, no theory, no practice. When he is without all, he is\r\n  with all.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Verily I am God, there is no God except me, so worship me!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Glory to me! how great is my majesty!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"I came forth from Báyazíd-ness as a snake from its skin. Then I\r\n  looked. I saw that lover, beloved, and love are one, for in the\r\n  world of unification all can be one.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"I am the wine-drinker and the wine and the cup-bearer.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in the course of a century, Ṣúfiism, which at first was little\r\nmore than asceticism, became in succession mystical and theosophical,\r\nand even ran the risk of being confused with pantheism. Henceforward the\r\nterm _Taṣawwuf_ unites all these varying shades. As a rule, however,\r\nthe great Ṣúfís of the third century A.H. (815-912 A.D.) keep their\r\nantinomian enthusiasm under control. Most of them agreed with Junayd of\r\nBaghdád († 909 A.D.), the leading theosophist of his time, in preferring\r\n\"the path of sobriety,\" and in seeking to reconcile the Law (_sharí‘at_)\r\nwith the Truth (_ḥaqíqat_). \"Our principles,\" said Sahl b. ‘Abdulláh\r\nal-Tustarí († 896 A.D.), \"are six: to hold fast by the Book of God, to\r\nmodel ourselves upon the Apostle (Muḥammad), to eat only what is\r\nlawful, to refrain from hurting people even though they hurt us, to\r\navoid forbidden things, and to fulfil obligations without delay.\" To\r\nthese articles the strictest Moslem might cheerfully subscribe.\r\nṢúfiism in its ascetic, moral, and devotional aspects was a\r\nspiritualised Islam, though it was a very different thing essentially.\r\nWhile doing lip-service to the established religion, it modified the\r\ndogmas of Islam in such a way as to deprive them of their original\r\nsignificance. Thus Allah, the God of mercy and wrath, was in a certain\r\nsense depersonalised and worshipped as the One absolutely Real\r\n(_al-Ḥaqq_). Here the Ṣúfís betray their kinship with the\r\nMu‘tazilites, but the two sects have little in common except the Greek\r\nphilosophy.[732] It must never be forgotten that Ṣúfiism was the\r\nexpression of a profound religious feeling--\"hatred of the world and\r\nlove of the Lord.\"[733] \"_Taṣawwuf_,\" said Junayd, \"is this: that God\r\nshould make thee die to thyself and should make thee live in Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe further development of Ṣúfiism may be indicated in a few words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The development of Ṣúfiism.]\r\n\r\nWhat was at first a form of religion adopted by individuals and\r\ncommunicated to a small circle of companions gradually became a monastic\r\nsystem, a school for saints, with rules of discipline and devotion which\r\nthe novice (_muríd_) learned from his spiritual director (_pír_ or\r\n_ustádh_), to whose guidance he submitted himself absolutely. Already in\r\nthe third century after Muḥammad it is increasingly evident that the\r\ntypical Ṣúfí adept of the future will no longer be a solitary ascetic\r\nshunning the sight of men, but a great Shaykh and hierophant, who\r\nappears on ceremonial occasions attended by a numerous train of admiring\r\ndisciples. Soon the doctrine began to be collected and embodied in\r\nbooks. Some of the most notable Arabic works of reference on Ṣúfiism\r\nhave been mentioned already. Among the oldest are the _Kitábu ’l-Luma‘_,\r\nby Abú Naṣr al-Sarráj († 988 A.D.) and the _Qútu ’l-Qulúb_ by Abú\r\nṬálib al-Makkí († 996 A.D.). The twelfth century saw the rise of the\r\nDervish Orders. ‘Adí al-Hakkárí († 1163 A.D.) and ‘Abdu ’l-Qádir al-Jílí\r\n(† 1166 A.D.) founded the fraternities which are called ‘Adawís and\r\nQádirís, after their respective heads. These were followed in rapid\r\nsuccession by the Rifá‘ís, the Shádhilís, and the Mevlevís, of whom the\r\nlast named owe their origin to the Persian poet and mystic, Jalálu\r\n’l-Dín Rúmí († 1273 A.D.). By this time, mainly through the influence of\r\nGhazálí, Ṣúfiism had won for itself a secure and recognised position\r\nin the Muḥammadan Church. Orthodoxy was forced to accept the popular\r\nSaint-worship and to admit the miracles of the _Awliyá_, although many\r\nMoslem puritans raised their voices against the superstitious veneration\r\nwhich was paid to the tombs of holy men, and against the prayers,\r\nsacrifices, and oblations offered by the pilgrims who assembled. Ghazálí\r\nalso gave the Ṣúfí doctrine a metaphysical basis. For this purpose he\r\navailed himself of the terminology, which Fárábí (also a Ṣúfí) and\r\nAvicenna had already borrowed from the Neo-platonists. From his time\r\nforward we find in Ṣúfí writings constant allusions to the Plotinian\r\ntheories of emanation and ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Umar Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ.]\r\n\r\nMysticism was more congenial to the Persians than to the Arabs, and its\r\ninfluence on Arabic literature is not to be compared with the\r\nextraordinary spell which it has cast over the Persian mind since the\r\neleventh century of the Christian era to the present day. With few\r\nexceptions, the great poets of Persia (and, we may add, of Turkey) speak\r\nthe allegorical language and use the fantastic imagery of which the\r\nquatrains of the Persian Ṣúfí, Abú Sa‘íd b. Abi ’l-Khayr,[734] afford\r\nalmost the first literary example. The Arabs have only one mystical poet\r\nworthy to stand beside the Persian masters. This is Sharafu ’l-Dín ‘Umar\r\nIbnu ’l-Fáriḍ, who was born in Cairo (1181 A.D.) and died there in\r\n1235. His _Díwán_ was edited by his grandson ‘Alí, and the following\r\nparticulars regarding the poet's life are extracted from the\r\nbiographical notice prefixed to this edition[735]:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Shaykh ‘Umar Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ was of middle stature; his face\r\n  was fair and comely, with a mingling of visible redness; and when he\r\n  was under the influence of music (_samá‘_) and rapture (_wajd_), and\r\n  overcome by ecstasy, it grew in beauty and brilliancy, and sweat\r\n  dropped from his body until it ran on the ground under his feet. I\r\n  never saw (so his son relates) among Arabs or foreigners a figure\r\n  equal in beauty to his, and I am the likest of all men to him in\r\n  form.... And when he walked in the city, the people used to press\r\n  round him asking his blessing and trying to kiss his hand, but he\r\n  would not allow anyone to do so, but put his hand in theirs....\r\n  ‘Umar Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ said: 'In the beginning of my detachment\r\n  (_tajríd_) from the world I used to beg permission of my father and\r\n  go up to the Wádi ’l-Mustaḍ‘afín on the second mountain of\r\n  al-Muqaṭṭam. Thither I would resort and continue in this\r\n  hermit life (_síyáḥa_) night and day; then I would return to my\r\n  father, as bound in duty to cherish his affection. My father was at\r\n  that time Lieutenant of the High Court (_khalífatu ’l-ḥukmi\r\n  ’l-‘azíz_) in Qáhira and Miṣr,[736] the two guarded cities, and\r\n  was one of the men most eminent for learning and affairs. He was\r\n  wont to be glad when I returned, and he frequently let me sit with\r\n  him in the chambers of the court and in the colleges of law. Then I\r\n  would long for \"detachment,\" and beg leave to return to the life of\r\n  a wandering devotee, and thus I was doing repeatedly, until my\r\n  father was asked to fill the office of Chief Justice (_Qáḍi\r\n  ’l-Quḍát_), but refused, and laid down the post which he held,\r\n  and retired from society, and gave himself entirely to God in the\r\n  preaching-hall (_qá‘atu ’l-khiṭába_) of the Mosque al-Azhar.\r\n  After his death I resumed my former detachment, and solitary\r\n  devotion, and travel in the way of Truth, but no revelation was\r\n  vouchsafed to me. One day I came to Cairo and entered the Sayfiyya\r\n  College. At the gate I found an old grocer performing an ablution\r\n  which was not prescribed. First he washed his hands, then his feet;\r\n  then he wiped his head and washed his face. \"O Shaykh,\" I said to\r\n  him, \"do you, after all these years, stand beside the gate of the\r\n  college among the Moslem divines and perform an irregular ablution?\"\r\n  He looked at me and said, \"O ‘Umar, nothing will be vouchsafed to\r\n  thee in Egypt, but only in the Ḥijáz, at Mecca (may God exalt\r\n  it!); set out thither, for the time of thy illumination hath come.\"\r\n  Then I knew that the man was one of God's saints and that he was\r\n  disguising himself by his manner of livelihood and by pretending to\r\n  be ignorant of the irregularity of the ablution. I seated myself\r\n  before him and said to him, \"O my master, how far am I from Mecca!\r\n  and I cannot find convoy or companions save in the months of\r\n  Pilgrimage.\" He looked at me and pointed with his hand and said,\r\n  \"Here is Mecca in front of thee\"; and as I looked with him, I saw\r\n  Mecca (may God exalt it!); and bidding him farewell, I set off to\r\n  seek it, and it was always in front of me until I entered it. At\r\n  that moment illumination came to me and continued without any\r\n  interruption.... I abode in a valley which was distant from Mecca\r\n  ten days' journey for a hard rider, and every day and night I would\r\n  come forth to pray the five prayers in the exalted Sanctuary, and\r\n  with me was a wild beast of huge size which accompanied me in my\r\n  going and returning, and knelt to me as a camel kneels, and said,\r\n  \"Mount, O my master,\" but I never did so.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen fifteen years had elapsed, ‘Umar Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ returned to\r\nCairo. The people venerated him as a saint, and the reigning monarch,\r\nMalik al-Kámil, wished to visit him in person, but ‘Umar declined to see\r\nhim, and rejected his bounty. \"At most times,\" says the poet's son, \"the\r\nShaykh was in a state of bewilderment, and his eyes stared fixedly. He\r\nneither heard nor saw any one speaking to him. Now he would stand, now\r\nsit, now repose on his side, now lie on his back wrapped up like a dead\r\nman; and thus would he pass ten consecutive days, more or less, neither\r\neating nor drinking nor speaking nor stirring.\" In 1231 A.D. he made the\r\npilgrimage to Mecca, on which occasion he met his famous contemporary,\r\nShihábu’ l-Dín Abú Ḥafṣ ‘Umar al-Suhrawardí. He died four years\r\nlater, and was buried in the Qaráfa cemetery at the foot of Mount\r\nMuqaṭṭam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The poetry of Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ.]\r\n\r\nHis _Díwán_ of mystical odes, which were first collected and published\r\nby his grandson, is small in extent compared with similar works in the\r\nPersian language, but of no unusual brevity when regarded as the\r\nproduction of an Arabian poet.[737] Concerning its general character\r\nsomething has been said above (p. 325). The commentator, Ḥasan\r\nal-Búríní († 1615 A.D.), praises the easy flow (_insijàm_) of the\r\nversification, and declares that Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ \"is accustomed to play\r\nwith ideas in ever-changing forms, and to clothe them with splendid\r\ngarments.\"[738] His style, full of verbal subtleties, betrays the\r\ninfluence of Mutanabbí.[739] The longest piece in the _Díwán_ is a Hymn\r\nof Divine Love, entitled _Naẓmu ’l-Sulúk_ ('Poem on the Mystic's\r\nProgress'), and often called _al-Tá’iyyatu ’l-Kubrá_ ('The Greater Ode\r\nrhyming in _t_'), which has been edited with a German verse-translation\r\nby Hammer-Purgstall (Vienna, 1854). On account of this poem the author\r\nwas accused of favouring the doctrine of _ḥulúl_, _i.e._, the\r\nincarnation of God in human beings. Another celebrated ode is the\r\n_Khamriyya_, or Hymn of Wine.[740]\r\n\r\nThe following versions will perhaps convey to English readers some faint\r\nimpression of the fervid rapture and almost ethereal exaltation which\r\ngive the poetry of Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ a unique place in Arabic\r\nliterature:--\r\n\r\n \"Let passion's swelling tide my senses drown!\r\n  Pity love's fuel, this long-smouldering heart,\r\n  Nor answer with a frown,\r\n  When I would fain behold Thee as Thou art,\r\n  '_Thou shall not see Me._'[741] O my soul, keep fast\r\n  The pledge thou gav'st: endure unfaltering to the last!\r\n  For Love is life, and death in love the Heaven\r\n  Where all sins are forgiven.\r\n  To those before and after and of this day,\r\n  That witnesseth my tribulation, say,\r\n  'By me be taught, me follow, me obey,\r\n  And tell my passion's story thro' wide East and West.'\r\n  With my Beloved I alone have been\r\n  When secrets tenderer than evening airs\r\n  Passed, and the Vision blest\r\n  Was granted to my prayers,\r\n  That crowned me, else obscure, with endless fame,\r\n  The while amazed between\r\n  His beauty and His majesty\r\n  I stood in silent ecstasy,\r\n  Revealing that which o'er my spirit went and came.\r\n  Lo! in His face commingled\r\n  Is every charm and grace;\r\n  The whole of Beauty singled\r\n  Into a perfect face\r\n  Beholding Him would cry,\r\n 'There is no God but He, and He is the most High!'\"[742]\r\n\r\nHere are the opening verses of the _Tá’iyyatu ’l-Ṣughrá_, or 'The\r\nLesser Ode rhyming in _t_,' which is so called in order to distinguish\r\nit from the _Tá’iyyatu ’l-Kubrá_:--\r\n\r\n \"Yea, in me the Zephyr kindled longing, O my loves, for you;\r\n  Sweetly breathed the balmy Zephyr, scattering odours when it blew;\r\n  Whispering to my heart at morning secret tales of those who dwell\r\n  (How my fainting heart it gladdened!) nigh the water and the well;\r\n  Murmuring in the grassy meadows, garmented with gentleness,\r\n  Languid love-sick airs diffusing, healing me of my distress.\r\n  When the green slopes wave before thee, Zephyr, in my loved Ḥijáz,\r\n  Thou, not wine that mads the others, art my rapture's only cause.\r\n  Thou the covenant eternal[743] callest back into my mind,\r\n  For but newly thou hast parted from my dear ones, happy Wind!\r\n  Driver of the dun-red camels that amidst acacias bide,\r\n  Soft and sofa-like thy saddle from the long and weary ride!\r\n  Blessings on thee, if descrying far-off Túḍih at noonday,\r\n  Thou wilt cross the desert hollows where the fawns of Wajra play,\r\n  And if from ‘Urayḍ's sand-hillocks bordering on stony ground\r\n  Thou wilt turn aside to Ḥuzwá, driver for Suwayqa bound,\r\n  And Ṭuwayli‘'s willows leaving, if to Sal‘ thou thence wilt ride--\r\n  Ask, I pray thee, of a people dwelling on the mountain-side!\r\n  Halt among the clan I cherish (so may health attend thee still!)\r\n  And deliver there my greeting to the Arabs of the hill.\r\n  For the tents are basking yonder, and in one of them is She\r\n  That bestows the meeting sparely, but the parting lavishly.\r\n  All around her as a rampart edge of sword and point of lance,\r\n  Yet my glances stray towards her when on me she deigns to glance.\r\n  Girt about with double raiment--soul and heart of mine, no less--\r\n  She is guarded from beholders, veiled by her unveiledness.\r\n  Death to me, in giving loose to my desire, she destineth;\r\n  Ah, how goodly seems the bargain, and how cheap is Love\r\n    for Death![744]\r\n\r\nIbnu ’l-Fáriḍ came of pure Arab stock, and his poetry is thoroughly\r\nArabian both in form and spirit. This is not the place to speak of the\r\ngreat Persian Ṣúfís, but Ḥusayn b. Manṣúr al-Ḥalláj, who was\r\nexecuted in the Caliphate of Muqtadir (922 A.D.), could not have been\r\nomitted here but for the fact that Professor Browne has already given an\r\nadmirable account of him, to which I am unable to add anything of\r\nimportance.[745] The Arabs, however, have contributed to the history of\r\nṢúfiism another memorable name--Muḥyi’l-Dín Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí, whose\r\nlife falls within the final century of the ‘Abbásid period, and will\r\ntherefore fitly conclude the present chapter.[746]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí.]\r\n\r\nMuḥyi ’l-Dín Muḥammad b. ‘Alí Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí (or Ibn ‘Arabí)[747]\r\nwas born at Mursiya (Murcia) in Spain on the 17th of Ramaḍán, 560\r\nA.H. = July 29, 1165 A.D. From 1173 to 1202 he resided in Seville. He\r\nthen set out for the East, travelling by way of Egypt to the Ḥijáz,\r\nwhere he stayed a long time, and after visiting Baghdád, Mosul, and Asia\r\nMinor, finally settled at Damascus, in which city he died (638 A.H. =\r\n1240 A.D.). His tomb below Mount Qásiyún was thought to be \"a piece of\r\nthe gardens of Paradise,\" and was called the Philosophers' Stone.[748]\r\nIt is now enclosed in a mosque which bears the name of Muḥyi ’l-Dín,\r\nand a cupola rises over it.[749] We know little concerning the events of\r\nhis life, which seems to have been passed chiefly in travel and\r\nconversation with Ṣúfís and in the composition of his voluminous\r\nwritings, about three hundred in number according to his own\r\ncomputation. Two of these works are especially celebrated, and have\r\ncaused Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí to be regarded as the greatest of all\r\nMuḥammadan mystics--the _Futúḥát al-Makkiyya_, or 'Meccan\r\nRevelations,' and the _Fuṣúṣú ’l-Ḥikam_, or 'Bezels of\r\nPhilosophy.' The _Futúḥát_ is a huge treatise in five hundred and\r\nsixty chapters, containing a complete system of mystical science. The\r\nauthor relates that he saw Muḥammad in the World of Real Ideas,\r\nseated on a throne amidst angels, prophets, and saints, and received his\r\ncommand to discourse on the Divine mysteries. At another time, while\r\ncircumambulating the Ka‘ba, he met a celestial spirit wearing the form\r\nof a youth engaged in the same holy rite, who showed him the living\r\nesoteric Temple which is concealed under the lifeless exterior, even as\r\nthe eternal substance of the Divine Ideas is hidden by the veils of\r\npopular religion--veils through which the lofty mind must penetrate,\r\nuntil, having reached the splendour within, it partakes of the Divine\r\nnature and beholds what no mortal eye can endure to look upon. Ibnu\r\n’l-‘Arabí immediately fell into a swoon. When he came to himself he was\r\ninstructed to contemplate the visionary form and to write down the\r\nmysteries which it would reveal to his gaze. Then the youth entered the\r\nKa‘ba with Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí, and resuming his spiritual aspect, appeared\r\nto him on a three-legged steed, breathed into his breast the knowledge\r\nof all things, and once more bade him describe the heavenly form in\r\nwhich all mysteries are enshrined.[750] Such is the reputed origin of\r\nthe 'Meccan Revelations,' of which the greater portion was written in\r\nthe town where inspiration descended on Muḥammad six hundred years\r\nbefore. The author believed, or pretended to believe, that every word of\r\nthem was dictated to him by supernatural means. The _Fúṣúṣ_, a\r\nshort work in twenty-seven chapters, each of which is named after one of\r\nthe prophets, is no less highly esteemed, and has been the subject of\r\nnumerous commentaries in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The doctrine of the Perfect Man.]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí combined the most extravagant mysticism\r\nwith the straitest orthodoxy. \"He was a Ẓáhirite (literalist) in\r\nreligion and a Báṭinite (spiritualist) in his speculative\r\nbeliefs.\"[751] He rejected all authority (_taqlíd_). \"I am not one of\r\nthose who say, 'Ibn Ḥazm said so-and-so, Aḥmad[752] said\r\nso-and-so, al-Nu‘mán[753] said so-and-so,'\" he declares in one of his\r\npoems. But although he insisted on punctilious adherence to the letter\r\nof the sacred law, we may suspect that his refusal to follow any human\r\nauthority, analogy, or opinion was simply the overweening presumption of\r\nthe seer who regards himself as divinely illuminated and infallible.\r\nMany theologians were scandalised by the apparently blasphemous\r\nexpressions which occur in his writings, and taxed him with holding\r\nheretical doctrines, _e.g._, the incarnation of God in man (_ḥulúl_)\r\nand the identification of man with God (_ittiḥád_). Centuries passed,\r\nbut controversy continued to rage over him. He found numerous and\r\nenthusiastic partisans, who urged that the utterances of the saints must\r\nnot be interpreted literally nor criticised at all. It was recognised,\r\nhowever, that such high mysteries were unsuitable for the weaker\r\nbrethren, so that many even of those who firmly believed in his sanctity\r\ndiscouraged the reading of his books. They were read nevertheless,\r\npublicly and privately, from one end of the Muḥammadan world to the\r\nother; people copied them for the sake of obtaining the author's\r\nblessing, and the manuscripts were eagerly bought. Among the\r\ndistinguished men who wrote in his defence we can mention here only\r\nMajdu ’l-Dín al-Fírúzábádí († 1414 A.D.), the author of the great Arabic\r\nlexicon entitled _al-Qámús_; Jalálu ’l-Dín al-Suyúṭí († 1445 A.D.);\r\nand ‘Abdu ’l-Wahháb al-Sha‘rání († 1565 A.D.). The fundamental principle\r\nof his system is the Unity of Being (_waḥdatu ’l-wujúd_). There is no\r\nreal difference between the Essence and its attributes or, in other\r\nwords, between God and the universe. All created things subsist\r\neternally as ideas (_a‘yán thábita_) in the knowledge of God, and since\r\nbeing is identical with knowledge, their \"creation\" only means His\r\nknowing them, or Himself, under the aspect of actuality; the universe,\r\nin fact, is the concrete sum of the relations of the Essence as subject\r\nto itself as object. This pantheistic monism puts on an Islamic mask in\r\nthe doctrine of \"the Perfect Man\" (_al-Insán al-Kámil_), a phrase which\r\nIbnu ’l-‘Arabí was the first to associate with it. The Divine\r\nconsciousness, evolving through a series of five planes\r\n(_ḥaḍarát_), attains to complete expression in Man, the\r\nmicrocosmic being who unites the creative and creaturely attributes of\r\nthe Essence and is at once the image of God and the archetype of the\r\nuniverse. Only through him does God know Himself and make Himself known;\r\nhe is the eye of the world whereby God sees His own works. The daring\r\nparadoxes of Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí's dialectic are illustrated by such verses\r\nas these:--\r\n\r\n  He praises me (by manifesting my perfections and creating me in\r\n    His form),\r\n  And I praise Him (by manifesting His perfections and obeying Him).\r\n  How can He be independent when I help and aid Him? (because the Divine\r\n    attributes derive the possibility of manifestation from their human\r\n    correlates).\r\n  For that cause God brought me into existence,\r\n  And I know Him and bring Him into existence (in my knowledge\r\n    and contemplation of Him).[754]\r\n\r\nThus it is the primary function of Man to reveal and realise his Divine\r\nnature; and the Perfect Men, regarded individually, are the prophets and\r\nsaints. Here the doctrine--an amalgam of Manichæan, Gnostic,\r\nNeo-platonic and Christian speculations--attaches itself to Muḥammad,\r\n\"the Seal of the prophets.\" According to Moslem belief, the pre-existent\r\nSpirit or Light of Muḥammad (_Núr Muḥammadí_) became incarnate in\r\nAdam and in the whole series of prophets, of whom Muḥammad is the\r\nlast. Muḥammad, then, is the Logos,[755] the Mediator, the Vicegerent\r\nof God (_Khalífat Allah_), the God-Man who has descended to this earthly\r\nsphere to make manifest the glory of Him who brought the universe into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí's philosophy carries him far beyond the\r\nrealm of positive religion. If God is the \"self\" of all things sensible\r\nand intelligible, it follows that He reveals Himself in every form of\r\nbelief in a degree proportionate to the pre-determined capacity of the\r\nbeliever; the mystic alone sees that He is One in all forms, for the\r\nmystic's heart is all-receptive: it assumes whatever form God reveals\r\nHimself in, as wax takes the impression of the seal.\r\n\r\n \"My heart is capable of every form,\r\n  A cloister for the monk, a fane for idols,\r\n  A pasture for gazelles, the pilgrim's Ka‘ba,\r\n  The Tables of the Torah, the Koran.\r\n  Love is the faith I hold: wherever turn\r\n  His camels, still the one true faith is mine.\"[756]\r\n\r\nThe vast bulk of Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí's writings, his technical and scholastic\r\nterminology, his recondite modes of thought, and the lack of method in\r\nhis exposition have, until recently, deterred European Orientalists from\r\nbestowing on him the attention which he deserves.[757] In the history of\r\nṢúfiism his name marks an epoch: it is owing to him that what began\r\nas a profoundly religious personal movement in Islam ends as an eclectic\r\nand definitely pantheistic system of philosophy. The title of \"The Grand\r\nMaster\" (_al-Shaykh al-Akbar_), by which he is commonly designated,\r\nbears witness to his supremacy in the world of Moslem mysticism from the\r\nMongol Invasion to the present day. In Persia and Turkey his influence\r\nhas been enormous, and through his pupil, Ṣadru ’l-Dín of Qóniya, he\r\nis linked with the greatest of all Ṣúfí poets, Jalálu ’l-Dín Rúmí,\r\nthe author of the _Mathnawí_, who died some thirty years after him. Nor\r\ndid all those who borrowed his ideas call themselves Moslems. He\r\ninspired, amongst other mediæval Christian writers, \"the Illuminated\r\nDoctor\" Raymond Lull, and probably Dante.[758]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ARABS IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that before the end of the first century of the\r\nHijra, in the reign of the Umayyad Caliph, Walíd b. ‘Abd al-Malik\r\n(705-715 A.D.), the Moslems under Ṭáriq and Músá b. Nuṣayr,\r\ncrossed the Mediterranean, and having defeated Roderic the Goth in a\r\ngreat battle near Cadiz, rapidly brought the whole of Spain into\r\nsubjection. The fate of the new province was long doubtful. The Berber\r\ninsurrection which raged in Africa (734-742 A.D.) spread to Spain and\r\nthreatened to exterminate the handful of Arab colonists; and no sooner\r\nwas this danger past than the victors began to rekindle the old feuds\r\nand jealousies which they had inherited from their ancestors of Qays and\r\nKalb. Once more the rival factions of Syria and Yemen flew to arms, and\r\nthe land was plunged in anarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán, the Umayyad.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán b. Mu‘áwiya, a grandson of the Caliph\r\nHishám, had escaped from the general massacre with which the ‘Abbásids\r\ncelebrated their triumph over the House of Umayya, and after five years\r\nof wandering adventure, accompanied only by his faithful freedman, Badr,\r\nhad reached the neighbourhood of Ceuta, where he found a precarious\r\nshelter with the Berber tribes. Young, ambitious, and full of confidence\r\nin his destiny, ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán conceived the bold plan of throwing\r\nhimself into Spain and of winning a kingdom with the help of the Arabs,\r\namongst whom, as he well knew, there were many clients of his own\r\nfamily. Accordingly in 755 A.D. he sent Badr across the sea on a secret\r\nmission. The envoy accomplished even more than was expected of him. To\r\ngain over the clients was easy, for ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán was their natural\r\nchief, and in the event of his success they would share with him the\r\nprize. Their number, however, was comparatively small. The pretender\r\ncould not hope to achieve anything unless he were supported by one of\r\nthe great parties, Syrians or Yemenites. At this time the former, led by\r\nthe feeble governor, Yúsuf b. ‘Abd al-Raḥmán al-Fihrí, and his cruel\r\nbut capable lieutenant, Ṣumayl b. Ḥátim, held the reins of power\r\nand were pursuing their adversaries with ruthless ferocity. The\r\nYemenites, therefore, hastened to range themselves on the side of ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Raḥmán, not that they loved his cause, but inspired solely by the\r\nprospect of taking a bloody vengeance upon the Syrians. These Spanish\r\nMoslems belonged to the true Bedouin stock!\r\n\r\nA few months later ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán landed in Spain, occupied Seville,\r\nand, routing Yúsuf and Ṣumayl under the walls of Cordova, made\r\nhimself master of the capital. On the same evening he presided, as\r\nGovernor of Spain, over the citizens assembled for public worship in the\r\ngreat Mosque (May, 756 A.D.).\r\n\r\nDuring his long reign of thirty-two years ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán was busily\r\nemployed in defending and consolidating the empire which more than once\r\nseemed to be on the point of slipping from his grasp. The task before\r\nhim was arduous in the extreme. On the one hand, he was confronted by\r\nthe unruly Arab aristocracy, jealous of their independence and regarding\r\nthe monarch as their common foe. Between him and them no permanent\r\ncompromise was possible, and since they could only be kept in check by\r\nan armed force stronger than themselves, he was compelled to rely on\r\nmercenaries, for the most part Berbers imported from Africa. Thus, by a\r\nfatal necessity the Moslem Empire in the West gradually assumed that\r\ndespotic and Prætorian character which we have learned to associate with\r\nthe ‘Abbásid Government in the period of its decline, and the results\r\nwere in the end hardly less disastrous. The monarchy had also to reckon\r\nwith the fanaticism of its Christian subjects and with a formidable\r\nSpanish national party eager to throw off the foreign yoke.\r\nExtraordinary energy and tact were needed to maintain authority over\r\nthese explosive elements, and if the dynasty founded by ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Raḥmán not only survived for two centuries and a half but gave to\r\nSpain a more splendid era of prosperity and culture than she had ever\r\nenjoyed, the credit is mainly due to the bold adventurer from whom even\r\nhis enemies could not withhold a tribute of admiration. One day, it is\r\nsaid, the Caliph Manṣúr asked his courtiers, \"Who is the Falcon of\r\nQuraysh?\" They replied, \"O Prince of the Faithful, that title belongs to\r\nyou who have vanquished mighty kings and have put an end to civil war.\"\r\n\"No,\" said the Caliph, \"it is not I.\" \"Mu‘áwiya, then, or ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Malik?\" \"No,\" said Manṣúr, \"the Falcon of Quraysh is ‘Abdu\r\n’l-Raḥmán b. Mu‘áwiya, he who traversed alone the deserts of Asia and\r\nAfrica, and without an army to aid him sought his fortune in an unknown\r\ncountry beyond the sea. With no weapons except judgment and resolution\r\nhe subdued his enemies, crushed the rebels, secured his frontiers, and\r\nfounded a great empire. Such a feat was never achieved by any one\r\nbefore.\"[759]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Islam in Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Yaḥyá b. Yaḥyá.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Revolt of the Suburb.]\r\n\r\nOf the Moslems in Spain the Arabs formed only a small minority, and\r\nthey, moreover, showed all the indifference towards religion and\r\ncontempt for the laws of Islam which might be expected from men imbued\r\nwith Bedouin traditions whose forbears had been devotedly attached to\r\nthe world-loving Umayyads of Damascus. It was otherwise with the Spanish\r\nconverts, the so-called 'Renegades' or _Muwalladún_ (Affiliati) living\r\nas clients under protection of the Arab nobility, and with the Berbers.\r\nThese races took their adopted religion very seriously, in accordance\r\nwith the fervid and sombre temperament which has always distinguished\r\nthem. Hence among the mass of Spanish Moslems a rigorous orthodoxy\r\nprevailed. The Berber, Yaḥyá b. Yaḥyá († 849 A.D.), is a typical\r\nfigure. At the age of twenty-eight years he travelled to the East and\r\nstudied under Málik. b Anas, who dictated to him his celebrated work\r\nknown as the _Muwaṭṭa’_. Yaḥyá was one day at Málik's lecture\r\nwith a number of fellow-students, when some one said, \"Here comes the\r\nelephant!\" All of them ran out to see the animal, but Yaḥyá did not\r\nstir. \"Why,\" said Málik, \"do you not go out and look at it? Such animals\r\nare not to be seen in Spain.\" To this Yaḥyá replied, \"I left my\r\ncountry for the purpose of seeing you and obtaining knowledge under your\r\nguidance. I did not come here to see the elephant.\" Málik was so pleased\r\nwith this answer that he called him the most intelligent (_‘áqil_) of\r\nthe people of Spain. On his return to Spain Yaḥyá exerted himself to\r\nspread the doctrines of his master, and though he obstinately refused,\r\non religious grounds, to accept any public office, his influence and\r\nreputation were such that, as Ibn Ḥazm says, no Cadi was ever\r\nappointed till Yaḥyá had given his opinion and designated the person\r\nwhom he preferred.[760] Thus the Málikite system, based on close\r\nadherence to tradition, became the law of the land. \"The Spaniards,\" it\r\nis observed by a learned writer of the tenth century, \"recognise only\r\nthe Koran and the _Muwaṭṭa’_; if they find a follower of Abú\r\nḤanífa or Sháfi‘í, they banish him from Spain, and if they meet with\r\na Mu‘tazilite or a Shí‘ite or any one of that sort, they often put him\r\nto death.\"[761] Arrogant, intensely bigoted, and ambitious of power, the\r\nMuḥammadan clergy were not disposed to play a subordinate rôle in the\r\nState. In Hishám (788-796 A.D.), the successor of ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán,\r\nthey had a prince after their own heart, whose piety and devotion to\r\ntheir interests left nothing to be desired. Ḥakam (796-822 A.D.) was\r\nless complaisant. He honoured and respected the clergy, but at the same\r\ntime he let them see that he would not permit them to interfere in\r\npolitical affairs. The malcontents, headed by the fiery Yaḥyá b.\r\nYaḥyá, replied with menaces and insults, and called on the populace\r\nof Cordova--especially the 'Renegades' in the southern quarter\r\n(_rabaḍ_) of the city--to rise against the tyrant and his insolent\r\nsoldiery. One day in Ramaḍán, 198 A.H. (May, 814 A.D.), Ḥakam\r\nsuddenly found himself cut off from the garrison and besieged in his\r\npalace by an infuriated mob, but he did not lose courage, and, thanks to\r\nhis coolness and skilful strategy, he came safely out of the peril in\r\nwhich he stood. The revolutionary suburb was burned to the ground and\r\nthose of its inhabitants who escaped massacre, some 60,000 souls, were\r\ndriven into exile. The real culprits went unpunished. Ḥakam could not\r\nafford further to exasperate the divines, who on their part began to\r\nperceive that they might obtain from the prince by favour what they had\r\nfailed to wring from him by force. Being mostly Arabs or Berbers, they\r\nhad a strong claim to his consideration. Their power was soon restored,\r\nand in the reign of ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán II (822-852 A.D.) Yaḥyá\r\nhimself, the ringleader of the mutiny, directed ecclesiastical policy\r\nand dispensed judicial patronage as he pleased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ‘Umar b. Ḥafṣún.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolt of the Suburb was only an episode in the long and sanguinary\r\nstruggle between the Spaniards, Moslem or Christian, on the one hand,\r\nand the monarchy of Cordova on the other--a struggle complicated by the\r\nrival Arab tribes, which sometimes patched up their own feuds in order\r\nto defend themselves against the Spanish patriots, but never in any\r\ncircumstances gave their support to the detested Umayyad Government. The\r\nhero of this war of independence was ‘Umar b. Ḥafṣún. He belonged\r\nto a noble family of West-Gothic origin which had gone over to Islam and\r\nsettled in the mountainous district north-east of Malaga. Hot-blooded,\r\nquarrelsome, and ready to stab on the slightest provocation, the young\r\nman soon fell into trouble. At first he took shelter in the wild\r\nfastnesses of Ronda, where he lived as a brigand until he was captured\r\nby the police. He then crossed the sea to Africa, but in a short time\r\nreturned to his old haunts and put himself at the head of a band of\r\nrobbers. Here he held out for two years, when, having been obliged to\r\nsurrender, he accepted the proposal of the Sultan of Cordova that he and\r\nhis companions should enlist in the Imperial army. But ‘Umar was\r\ndestined for greater glory than the Sultan could confer upon him. A few\r\ncontemptuous words from a superior officer touched his pride to the\r\nquick, so one fine day he galloped off with all his men in the direction\r\nof Ronda. They found an almost impregnable retreat in the castle of\r\nBobastro, which had once been a Roman fortress. From this moment, says\r\nDozy, ‘Umar b. Ḥafṣún was no longer a brigand-chief, but leader of\r\nthe whole Spanish race in the south. The lawless and petulant free-lance\r\nwas transformed into a high-minded patriot, celebrated for the stern\r\njustice with which he punished the least act of violence, adored by his\r\nsoldiers, and regarded by his countrymen as the champion of the national\r\ncause. During the rest of his life (884-917 A.D.) he conducted the\r\nguerilla with untiring energy and made himself a terror to the Arabs,\r\nbut fortune deserted him at the last, and he died--_felix opportunitate\r\nmortis_--only a few years before complete ruin overtook his party. The\r\nMoslem Spaniards, whose enthusiasm had been sensibly weakened by their\r\nleader's conversion to Christianity, were the more anxious to make their\r\npeace with the Government, since they saw plainly the hopelessness of\r\ncontinuing the struggle.\r\n\r\nIn 912 A.D. ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III, the Defender of the Faith\r\n(_al-Náṣir li-díní ’lláh_), succeeded his grandfather, the Amír\r\n‘Abdulláh, on the throne of Cordova. The character, genius, and\r\nenterprise of this great monarch are strikingly depicted in the\r\nfollowing passage from the pen of an eloquent historian whose work,\r\nalthough it was published some fifty years ago, will always be\r\nauthoritative[762]:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III (912-961 A.D).]\r\n\r\n  \"Amongst the Umayyad sovereigns who have ruled Spain the first place\r\n  belongs incontestably to ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III. What he\r\n  accomplished was almost miraculous. He had found the empire\r\n  abandoned to anarchy and civil war, rent by factions, parcelled\r\n  amongst a multitude of heterogeneous princes, exposed to incessant\r\n  attacks from the Christians of the north, and on the eve of being\r\n  swallowed up either by the Léonnese or the Africans. In spite of\r\n  innumerable obstacles he had saved Spain both from herself and from\r\n  the foreign domination. He had endowed her with new life and made\r\n  her greater and stronger than she had ever been. He had given her\r\n  order and prosperity at home, consideration and respect abroad. The\r\n  public treasury, which he had found in a deplorable condition, was\r\n  now overflowing. Of the Imperial revenues, which amounted annually\r\n  to 6,245,000 pieces of gold, a third sufficed for ordinary expenses;\r\n  a third was held in reserve, and ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán devoted the\r\n  remainder to his buildings. It was calculated that in the year 951\r\n  he had in his coffers the enormous sum of 20,000,000 pieces of gold,\r\n  so that a traveller not without judgment in matters of finance\r\n  assures us that ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán and the Ḥamdánid (Náṣiru\r\n  ’l-Dawla), who was then reigning over Mesopotamia, were the\r\n  wealthiest princes of that epoch. The state of the country was in\r\n  keeping with the prosperous condition of the treasury. Agriculture,\r\n  industry, commerce, the arts and the sciences, all flourished....\r\n  Cordova, with its half-million inhabitants, its three thousand\r\n  mosques, its superb palaces, its hundred and thirteen thousand\r\n  houses, its three hundred bagnios, and its twenty-eight suburbs, was\r\n  inferior in extent and splendour only to Baghdád, with which city\r\n  the Cordovans loved to compare it.... The power of ‘Abdu\r\n  ’l-Raḥmán was formidable. A magnificent fleet enabled him to\r\n  dispute with the Fáṭimids the empire of the Mediterranean, and\r\n  secured him in the possession of Ceuta, the key of Mauritania. A\r\n  numerous and well-disciplined army, perhaps the finest in the world,\r\n  gave him superiority over the Christians of the north. The proudest\r\n  sovereigns solicited his alliance. The emperor of Constantinople,\r\n  the kings of Germany, Italy, and France sent ambassadors to him.\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly, these were brilliant results; but what excites our\r\n  astonishment and admiration when we study this glorious reign is not\r\n  so much the work as the workman: it is the might of that\r\n  comprehensive intelligence which nothing escaped, and which showed\r\n  itself no less admirable in the minutest details than in the\r\n  loftiest conceptions. This subtle and sagacious man, who\r\n  centralises, who founds the unity of the nation and of the monarchy,\r\n  who by means of his alliances establishes a sort of political\r\n  equilibrium, who in his large tolerance calls the professors of\r\n  another religion into his councils, is a modern king rather than a\r\n  mediæval Caliph.\"[763]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regency of Manṣúr Ibn Abí ‘Ámir (976-1002 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nIn short, ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III made the Spanish Moslems one people,\r\nand formed out of Arabs and Spaniards a united Andalusian nation, which,\r\nas we shall presently see, advanced with incredible swiftness to a\r\nheight of culture that was the envy of Europe and was not exceeded by\r\nany contemporary State in the Muḥammadan East. With his death,\r\nhowever, the decline of the Umayyad dynasty began. His son, Ḥakam II\r\n(† 976 A.D.), left as heir-apparent a boy eleven years old, Hishám II,\r\nwho received the title of Caliph while the government was carried on by\r\nhis mother Aurora and the ambitious minister Muḥammad b. Abí ‘Ámir.\r\nThe latter was virtually monarch of Spain, and whatever may be thought\r\nof the means by which he rose to eminence, or of his treatment of the\r\nunfortunate Caliph whose mental faculties he deliberately stunted and\r\nwhom he condemned to a life of monkish seclusion, it is impossible to\r\ndeny that he ruled well and nobly. He was a great statesman and a great\r\nsoldier. No one could accuse him of making an idle boast when he named\r\nhimself 'Al-Manṣúr' ('The Victorious'). Twice every year he was\r\naccustomed to lead his army against the Christians, and such was the\r\npanic which he inspired that in the course of more than fifty campaigns\r\nhe scarcely ever lost a battle. He died in 1002 A.D. A Christian monk,\r\nrecording the event in his chronicle, adds, \"he was buried in Hell,\" but\r\nMoslem hands engraved the following lines upon the tomb of their\r\nchampion:--\r\n\r\n \"His story in his relics you may trace,\r\n  As tho' he stood before you face to face.\r\n  Never will Time bring forth his peer again,\r\n  Nor one to guard, like him, the gaps of Spain.\"[764]\r\n\r\nHis demise left the Prætorians masters of the situation. Berbers and\r\nSlaves[765] divided the kingdom between them, and amidst revolution and\r\ncivil war the Umayyad dynasty passed away (1031 A.D.).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Party Kings (_Mulúku ’l-Ṭawá’if_).]\r\n\r\nIt has been said with truth that the history of Spain in the eleventh\r\ncentury bears a close resemblance to that of Italy in the fifteenth. The\r\nsplendid empire of ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III was broken up, and from its\r\nruins there emerged a fortuitous conglomeration of petty states governed\r\nby successful condottieri. Of these Party Kings (_Mulúku\r\n’l-Ṭawá’if_), as they are called by Muḥammadan writers, the most\r\npowerful were the ‘Abbádids of Seville. Although it was an age of\r\npolitical decay, the material prosperity of Spain had as yet suffered\r\nlittle diminution, whilst in point of culture the society of this time\r\nreached a level hitherto unequalled. Here, then, we may pause for a\r\nmoment to review the progress of literature and science during the most\r\nfruitful period of the Moslem occupation of European soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Arabic culture on the Spaniards.]\r\n\r\nWhilst in Asia, as we have seen, the Arab conquerors yielded to the\r\nspell of an ancient culture infinitely superior to their own, they no\r\nsooner crossed the Straits of Gibraltar than the rôles were reversed. As\r\nthe invaders extended their conquests to every part of the peninsula,\r\nthousands of Christians fell into their hands, who generally continued\r\nto live under Moslem protection. They were well treated by the\r\nGovernment, enjoyed religious liberty, and often rose to high offices in\r\nthe army or at court. Many of them became rapidly imbued with Moslem\r\ncivilisation, so that as early as the middle of the ninth century we\r\nfind Alvaro, Bishop of Cordova, complaining that his co-religionists\r\nread the poems and romances of the Arabs, and studied the writings of\r\nMuḥammadan theologians and philosophers, not in order to refute them\r\nbut to learn how to express themselves in Arabic with correctness and\r\nelegance. \"Where,\" he asks, \"can any one meet nowadays with a layman who\r\nreads the Latin commentaries on the Holy Scriptures? Who studies the\r\nGospels, the Prophets, the Apostles? Alas, all young Christians of\r\nconspicuous talents are acquainted only with the language and writings\r\nof the Arabs; they read and study Arabic books with the utmost zeal,\r\nspend immense sums of money in collecting them for their libraries, and\r\nproclaim everywhere that this literature is admirable. On the other\r\nhand, if you talk with them of Christian books, they reply\r\ncontemptuously that these books are not worth their notice. Alas, the\r\nChristians have forgotten their own language, and amongst thousands of\r\nus scarce one is to be found who can write a tolerable Latin letter to a\r\nfriend; whereas very many are capable of expressing themselves\r\nexquisitely in Arabic and of composing poems in that tongue with even\r\ngreater skill than the Arabs themselves.\"[766]\r\n\r\nHowever the good bishop may have exaggerated, it is evident that\r\nMuḥammadan culture had a strong attraction for the Spanish\r\nChristians, and equally, let us add, for the Jews, who made numerous\r\ncontributions to poetry, philosophy, and science in their native speech\r\nas well as in the kindred Arabic idiom. The 'Renegades,' or Spanish\r\nconverts to Islam, became completely Arabicised in the course of a few\r\ngenerations; and from this class sprang some of the chief ornaments of\r\nSpanish-Arabian literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The poetry of the Spanish Arabs.]\r\n\r\nConsidered as a whole, the poetry of the Moslems in Europe shows the\r\nsame characteristics which have already been noted in the work of their\r\nEastern contemporaries. The paralysing conventions from which the\r\nlaureates of Baghdád and Aleppo could not emancipate themselves remained\r\nin full force at Cordova and Seville. Yet, just as Arabic poetry in the\r\nEast was modified by the influences of Persian culture, in Spain also\r\nthe gradual amalgamation of Aryans with Semites introduced new elements\r\nwhich have left their mark on the literature of both races. Perhaps the\r\nmost interesting features of Spanish-Arabian poetry are the tenderly\r\nromantic feeling which not infrequently appears in the love-songs, a\r\nfeeling that sometimes anticipates the attitude of mediæval chivalry;\r\nand in the second place an almost modern sensibility to the beauties of\r\nnature. On account of these characteristics the poems in question appeal\r\nto many European readers who do not easily enter into the spirit of the\r\n_Mu‘allaqát_ or the odes of Mutanabbí, and if space allowed it would be\r\na pleasant task to translate some of the charming lyric and descriptive\r\npieces which have been collected by anthologists. The omission, however,\r\nis less grave inasmuch as Von Schack has given us a series of excellent\r\nversions in his _Poesie und Kunst der Araber in Spanien und Sicilien_\r\n(2nd ed., Stuttgart, 1877).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Folk-songs.]\r\n\r\n\"One of its marvels,\" says Qazwíní, referring to the town of Shilb\r\n(Silves) in Portugal, \"is the fact, which innumerable persons have\r\nmentioned, that the people living there, with few exceptions, are makers\r\nof verse and devoted to belles-lettres; and if you passed by a labourer\r\nstanding behind his plough and asked him to recite some verses, he would\r\nat once improvise on any subject that you might demand.\"[767] Of such\r\nfolk-songs the _zajal_ and _muwashshaḥ_ were favourite types.[768]\r\nBoth forms were invented in Spain, and their structure is very similar,\r\nconsisting of several stanzas in which the rhymes are so arranged that\r\nthe master-rhyme ending each stanza and running through the whole poem\r\nlike a refrain is continually interrupted by a various succession of\r\nsubordinate rhymes, as is shown in the following scheme:--\r\n\r\n  _aa_\r\n  _bbba_\r\n  _ccca_\r\n  _ddda._\r\n\r\nMany of these songs and ballads were composed in the vulgar dialect and\r\nwithout regard to the rules of classical prosody. The troubadour Ibn\r\nQuzmán († 1160 A.D.) first raised the _zajal_ to literary rank. Here is\r\nan example of the _muwashshaḥ_:--\r\n\r\n \"Come, hand the precious cup to me,\r\n  And brim it high with a golden sea!\r\n  Let the old wine circle from guest to guest,\r\n  While the bubbles gleam like pearls on its breast,\r\n  So that night is of darkness dispossessed.\r\n  How it foams and twinkles in fiery glee!\r\n  'Tis drawn from the Pleiads' cluster, perdie.\r\n\r\n  Pass it, to music's melting sound,\r\n  Here on this flowery carpet round,\r\n  Where gentle dews refresh the ground\r\n  And bathe my limbs deliciously\r\n  In their cool and balmy fragrancy.\r\n\r\n  Alone with me in the garden green\r\n  A singing-girl enchants the scene:\r\n  Her smile diffuses a radiant sheen.\r\n  I cast off shame, for no spy can see,\r\n  And 'Hola,' I cry, 'let us merry be!'\"[769]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Verses by ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán I.]\r\n\r\nTrue to the traditions of their family, the Spanish Umayyads loved\r\npoetry, music, and polite literature a great deal better than the Koran.\r\nEven the Falcon of Quraysh, ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán I, if the famous verses\r\non the Palm-tree are really by him, concealed something of the softer\r\ngraces under his grim exterior. It is said that in his gardens at\r\nCordova there was a solitary date-palm, which had been transplanted from\r\nSyria, and that one day ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán, as he gazed upon it,\r\nremembered his native land and felt the bitterness of exile and\r\nexclaimed:--\r\n\r\n \"O Palm, thou art a stranger in the West,\r\n  Far from thy Orient home, like me unblest.\r\n  Weep! But thou canst not. Dumb, dejected tree,\r\n  Thou art not made to sympathise with me.\r\n  Ah, thou wouldst weep, if thou hadst tears to pour,\r\n  For thy companions on Euphrates' shore;\r\n  But yonder tall groves thou rememberest not,\r\n  As I, in hating foes, have my old friends forgot.\"[770]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ziryáb the musician.]\r\n\r\nAt the court of ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán II (822-852 A.D.) a Persian musician\r\nwas prime favourite. This was Ziryáb, a client of the Caliph Mahdí and a\r\npupil of the celebrated singer, Isḥáq al-Mawṣilí.[771] Isḥáq,\r\nseeing in the young man a dangerous rival to himself, persuaded him to\r\nquit Baghdád and seek his fortune in Spain. ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán received\r\nhim with open arms, gave him a magnificent house and princely salary,\r\nand bestowed upon him every mark of honour imaginable. The versatile and\r\naccomplished artist wielded a vast influence. He set the fashion in all\r\nthings appertaining to taste and manners; he fixed the toilette,\r\nsanctioned the cuisine, and prescribed what dress should be worn in the\r\ndifferent seasons of the year. The kings of Spain took him as a model,\r\nand his authority was constantly invoked and universally recognised in\r\nthat country down to the last days of Moslem rule.[772] Ziryáb was only\r\none of many talented and learned men who came to Spain from the East,\r\nwhile the list of Spanish savants who journeyed \"in quest of knowledge\"\r\n(_fí ṭalabi ’l-‘ilm_) to Africa and Egypt, to the Holy Cities of\r\nArabia, to the great capitals of Syria and ‘Iráq, to Khurásán,\r\nTransoxania, and in some cases even to China, includes, as may be seen\r\nfrom the perusal of Maqqarí's fifth chapter, nearly all the eminent\r\nscholars and men of letters whom Moslem Spain has produced. Thus a\r\nlively exchange of ideas was continually in movement, and so little\r\nprovincialism existed that famous Andalusian poets, like Ibn Hání and\r\nIbn Zaydún, are described by admiring Eastern critics as the Buḥturís\r\nand Mutanabbís of the West.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Library of Ḥakam II.]\r\n\r\nThe tenth century of the Christian era is a fortunate and illustrious\r\nperiod in Spanish history. Under ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III and his\r\nsuccessor, Ḥakam II, the nation, hitherto torn asunder by civil war,\r\nbent its united energies to the advancement of material and intellectual\r\nculture. Ḥakam was an enthusiastic bibliophile. He sent his agents in\r\nevery direction to purchase manuscripts, and collected 400,000 volumes\r\nin his palace, which was thronged with librarians, copyists, and\r\nbookbinders. All these books, we are told, he had himself read, and he\r\nannotated most of them with his own hand. His munificence to scholars\r\nknew no bounds. He made a present of 1,000 dínárs to Abu ’l-Faraj of\r\nIṣfahán, in order to secure the first copy that was published of the\r\ngreat 'Book of Songs' (_Kitábu ’l-Aghání_), on which the author was then\r\nengaged. Besides honouring and encouraging the learned, Ḥakam took\r\nmeasures to spread the benefits of education amongst the poorest of his\r\nsubjects. With this view he founded twenty-seven free schools in the\r\ncapital and paid the teachers out of his private purse. Whilst in\r\nChristian Europe the rudiments of learning were confined to the clergy,\r\nin Spain almost every one could read and write.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The University of Cordova.]\r\n\r\n  \"The University of Cordova was at that time one of the most\r\n  celebrated in the world. In the principal Mosque, where the lectures\r\n  were held, Abú Bakr b. Mu‘áwiya, the Qurayshite, discussed the\r\n  Traditions relating to Muḥammad. Abú ‘Alí al-Qálí of Baghdád\r\n  dictated a large and excellent miscellany which contained an immense\r\n  quantity of curious information concerning the ancient Arabs, their\r\n  proverbs, their language, and their poetry. This collection he\r\n  afterwards published under the title of _Amálí_, or 'Dictations.'\r\n  Grammar was taught by Ibnu ’l-Qúṭiyya, who, in the opinion of Abú\r\n  ‘Ali al-Qálí, was the leading grammarian of Spain. Other sciences\r\n  had representatives no less renowned. Accordingly the students\r\n  attending the classes were reckoned by thousands. The majority were\r\n  students of what was called _fiqh_, that is to say, theology and\r\n  law, for that science then opened the way to the most lucrative\r\n  posts.\"[773]\r\n\r\nAmong the notable savants of this epoch we may mention Ibn ‘Abdi Rabbihi\r\n(† 940 A.D.), laureate of ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III and author of a\r\nwell-known anthology entitled _al-‘Iqd al-Faríd_; the poet Ibn Hání of\r\nSeville († 973 A.D.), an Ismá‘ílí convert who addressed blasphemous\r\npanegyrics to the Fáṭimid Caliph Mu‘izz;[774] the historians of\r\nSpain, Abú Bakr al-Rází († 937 A.D.), whose family belonged to Rayy in\r\nPersia, and Ibnu ’l-Qúṭiyya († 977 A.D.), who, as his name indicates,\r\nwas the descendant of a Gothic princess; the astronomer and\r\nmathematician Maslama b. Aḥmad of Madrid († 1007 A.D.); and the great\r\nsurgeon Abu ’l-Qásim al-Zahráwí of Cordova, who died about the same\r\ntime, and who became known to Europe by the name of Albucasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Abbádids (1023-1091 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mu‘tamid of Seville (1069-1091 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Spanish Umayyads, which took place in the first half of\r\nthe eleventh century, left Cordova a republic and a merely provincial\r\ntown; and though she might still claim to be regarded as the literary\r\nmetropolis of Spain, her ancient glories were overshadowed by the\r\nindependent dynasties which now begin to flourish in Seville, Almeria,\r\nBadajoz, Granada, Toledo, Malaga, Valencia, and other cities. Of these\r\nrival princedoms the most formidable in arms and the most brilliant in\r\nits cultivation of the arts was, beyond question, the family of the\r\n‘Abbádids, who reigned in Seville. The foundations of their power were\r\nlaid by the Cadi Abu ’l-Qásim Muḥammad. \"He acted towards the people\r\nwith such justice and moderation as drew on him the attention of every\r\neye and the love of every heart,\" so that the office of chief magistrate\r\nwas willingly conceded to him. In order to obtain the monarchy which he\r\ncoveted, the Cadi employed an audacious ruse. The last Umayyad Caliph,\r\nHishám II, had vanished mysteriously: it was generally supposed that,\r\nafter escaping from Cordova when that city was stormed by the Berbers\r\n(1013 A.D.), he fled to Asia and died unknown; but many believed that he\r\nwas still alive. Twenty years after his disappearance there suddenly\r\narose a pretender, named Khalaf, who gave out that he was the Caliph\r\nHishám. The likeness between them was strong enough to make the\r\nimposture plausible. At any rate, the Cadi had his own reasons for\r\nabetting it. He called on the people, who were deeply attached to the\r\nUmayyad dynasty, to rally round their legitimate sovereign. Cordova and\r\nseveral other States recognised the authority of this pseudo-Caliph,\r\nwhom Abu ’l-Qásim used as a catspaw. His son ‘Abbád, a treacherous and\r\nbloodthirsty tyrant, but an amateur of belles-lettres, threw off the\r\nmask and reigned under the title of al-Mu‘taḍid (1042-1069 A.D.). He\r\nin turn was succeeded by his son, al-Mu‘tamid, whose strange and\r\nromantic history reminds one of a sentence frequently occurring in the\r\n_Arabian Nights_: \"Were it graven with needle-gravers upon the\r\neye-corners, it were a warner to whoso would be warned.\" He is described\r\nas \"the most liberal, the most hospitable, the most munificent, and the\r\nmost powerful of all the princes who ruled in Spain. His court was the\r\nhalting-place of travellers, the rendezvous of poets, the point to which\r\nall hopes were directed, and the haunt of men of talent.\"[775] Mu‘tamid\r\nhimself was a poet of rare distinction. \"He left,\" says Ibn Bassám,\r\n\"some pieces of verse beautiful as the bud when it opens to disclose the\r\nflower; and had the like been composed by persons who made of poetry a\r\nprofession and a merchandise, they would still have been considered\r\ncharming, admirable, and singularly original.\"[776] Numberless anecdotes\r\nare told of Mu‘tamid's luxurious life at Seville: his evening rambles\r\nalong the banks of the Guadalquivir; his parties of pleasure; his\r\nadventures when he sallied forth in disguise, accompanied by his Vizier,\r\nthe poet Ibn ‘Ammár, into the streets of the sleeping city; and his\r\npassion for the slave-girl I‘timád, commonly known as Rumaykiyya, whom\r\nhe loved all his life with constant devotion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, a terrible catastrophe was approaching. The causes\r\nwhich led up to it are related by Ibn Khallikán as follows[777]:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The Almoravides in Spain.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Battle of Zalláqa (October 23, 1086 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n  \"At that time Alphonso VI, the son of Ferdinand, the sovereign of\r\n  Castile and king of the Spanish Franks, had become so powerful that\r\n  the petty Moslem princes were obliged to make peace with him and pay\r\n  him tribute. Mu‘tamid Ibn ‘Abbád surpassed all the rest in greatness\r\n  of power and extent of empire, yet he also paid tribute to Alphonso.\r\n  After capturing Toledo (May 29, 1085 A.D.) the Christian monarch\r\n  sent him a threatening message with the demand that he should\r\n  surrender his fortresses; on which condition he might retain the\r\n  open country as his own. These words provoked Mu‘tamid to such a\r\n  degree that he struck the ambassador and put to death all those who\r\n  accompanied him.[778] Alphonso, who was marching on Cordova, no\r\n  sooner received intelligence of this event than he returned to\r\n  Toledo in order to provide machines for the siege of Seville. When\r\n  the Shaykhs and doctors of Islam were informed of this project they\r\n  assembled and said: 'Behold how the Moslem cities fall into the\r\n  hands of the Franks whilst our sovereigns are engaged in warfare\r\n  against each other! If things continue in this state the Franks will\r\n  subdue the entire country.' They then went to the Cadi (of Cordova),\r\n  ‘Abdulláh b. Muḥammad b. Adham, and conferred with him on the\r\n  disasters which had befallen the Moslems and on the means by which\r\n  they might be remedied. Every person had something to say, but it\r\n  was finally resolved that they should write to Abú Ya‘qúb Yúsuf b.\r\n  Táshifín, the king of the _Mulaththamún_[779] and sovereign of\r\n  Morocco, imploring his assistance. The Cadi then waited on Mu‘tamid,\r\n  and informed him of what had passed. Mu‘tamid concurred with them on\r\n  the expediency of such an application, and told the Cadi to bear the\r\n  message himself to Yúsuf b. Táshifín. A conference took place at\r\n  Ceuta. Yúsuf recalled from the city of Morocco the troops which he\r\n  had left there, and when all were mustered he sent them across to\r\n  Spain, and followed with a body of 10,000 men. Mu‘tamid, who had\r\n  also assembled an army, went to meet him; and the Moslems, on\r\n  hearing the news, hastened from every province for the purpose of\r\n  combating the infidels. Alphonso, who was then at Toledo, took the\r\n  field with 40,000 horse, exclusive of other troops which came to\r\n  join him. He wrote a long and threatening letter to Yúsuf b.\r\n  Táshifín, who inscribed on the back of it these words: '_What will\r\n  happen thou shalt see!_' and returned it. On reading the answer\r\n  Alphonso was filled with apprehension, and observed that this was a\r\n  man of resolution. The two armies met at Zalláqa, near Badajoz. The\r\n  Moslems gained the victory, and Alphonso fled with a few others,\r\n  after witnessing the complete destruction of his army. This year was\r\n  adopted in Spain as the commencement of a new era, and was called\r\n  the year of Zalláqa.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captivity and death of Mu‘tamid.]\r\n\r\nMu‘tamid soon perceived that he had \"dug his own grave\"--to quote the\r\nwords used by himself a few years afterwards--when he sought aid from\r\nthe perfidious Almoravide. Yúsuf could not but contrast the beauty,\r\nriches, and magnificent resources of Spain with the barren deserts and\r\nrude civilisation of Africa. He was not content to admire at a distance\r\nthe enchanting view which had been dangled before him. In the following\r\nyear he returned to Spain and took possession of Granada. He next\r\nproceeded to pick a quarrel with Mu‘tamid. The Berber army laid siege to\r\nSeville, and although Mu‘tamid displayed the utmost bravery, he was\r\nunable to prevent the fall of his capital (September, 1091 A.D.). The\r\nunfortunate prince was thrown into chains and transported to Morocco.\r\nYúsuf spared his life, but kept him a prisoner at Aghmát, where he died\r\nin 1095 A.D. During his captivity he bewailed in touching poems the\r\nmisery of his state, the sufferings which he and his family had to\r\nendure, and the tragic doom which suddenly deprived him of friends,\r\nfortune, and power. \"Every one loves Mu‘tamid,\" wrote an historian of\r\nthe thirteenth century, \"every one pities him, and even now he is\r\nlamented.\"[780] He deserved no less, for, as Dozy remarks, he was \"the\r\nlast Spanish-born king (_le dernier roi indigène_), who represented\r\nworthily, nay, brilliantly, a nationality and culture which succumbed,\r\nor barely survived, under the dominion of barbarian invaders.\"[781]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Zaydún.]\r\n\r\nThe Age of the Tyrants, to borrow from Greek history a designation which\r\nwell describes the character of this period, yields to no other in\r\nliterary and scientific renown. Poetry was cultivated at every\r\nAndalusian court. If Seville could point with just pride to Mu‘tamid and\r\nhis Vizier, Ibn ‘Ammár, Cordova claimed a second pair almost equally\r\nillustrious--Ibn Zaydún (1003-1071 A.D.) and Walláda, a daughter of the\r\nUmayyad Caliph al-Mustakfí. Ibn Zaydún entered upon a political career\r\nand became the confidential agent of Ibn Jahwar, the chief magistrate of\r\nCordova, but he fell into disgrace, probably on account of his love for\r\nthe beautiful and talented princess, who inspired those tender melodies\r\nwhich have caused the poet's European biographers to link his name with\r\nTibullus and Petrarch. In the hope of seeing her, although he durst not\r\nshow himself openly, he lingered in al-Zahrá, the royal suburb of\r\nCordova built by ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III. At last, after many wanderings,\r\nhe found a home at Seville, where he was cordially received by\r\nMu‘taḍid, who treated him as an intimate friend and bestowed on him\r\nthe title of _Dhu ’l-Wizáratayn_.[782] The following verses, which he\r\naddressed to Walláda, depict the lovely scenery of al-Zahrá and may\r\nserve to illustrate the deep feeling for nature which, as has been said,\r\nis characteristic of Spanish-Arabian poetry in general.[783]\r\n\r\n \"To-day my longing thoughts recall thee here;\r\n  The landscape glitters, and the sky is clear.\r\n  So feebly breathes the gentle zephyr's gale,\r\n  In pity of my grief it seems to fail.\r\n  The silvery fountains laugh, as from a girl's\r\n  Fair throat a broken necklace sheds its pearls.\r\n  Oh, 'tis a day like those of our sweet prime,\r\n  When, stealing pleasures from indulgent Time,\r\n  We played midst flowers of eye-bewitching hue,\r\n  That bent their heads beneath the drops of dew.\r\n  Alas, they see me now bereaved of sleep;\r\n  They share my passion and with me they weep.\r\n  Here in her sunny haunt the rose blooms bright,\r\n  Adding new lustre to Aurora's light;\r\n  And waked by morning beams, yet languid still,\r\n  The rival lotus doth his perfume spill.\r\n  All stirs in me the memory of that fire\r\n  Which in my tortured breast will ne'er expire.\r\n  Had death come ere we parted, it had been\r\n  The best of all days in the world, I ween;\r\n  And this poor heart, where thou art every thing,\r\n  Would not be fluttering now on passion's wing.\r\n  Ah, might the zephyr waft me tenderly,\r\n  Worn out with anguish as I am, to thee!\r\n  O treasure mine, if lover e'er possessed\r\n  A treasure! O thou dearest, queenliest!\r\n  Once, once, we paid the debt of love complete\r\n  And ran an equal race with eager feet.\r\n  How true, how blameless was the love I bore,\r\n  Thou hast forgotten; but I still adore!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Ḥazm (994-1064 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe greatest scholar and the most original genius of Moslem Spain is Abú\r\nMuḥammad ‘Alí Ibn Ḥazm, who was born at Cordova in 994 A.D. He\r\ncame of a 'Renegade' family, but he was so far from honouring his\r\nChristian ancestors that he pretended to trace his descent to a Persian\r\nfreedman of Yazíd b. Abí Sufyán, a brother of the first Umayyad Caliph,\r\nMu‘áwiya; and his contempt for Christianity was in proportion to his\r\nfanatical zeal on behalf of Islam. His father, Aḥmad, had filled the\r\noffice of Vizier under Manṣúr Ibn Abí ‘Ámir, and Ibn Ḥazm himself\r\nplunged ardently into politics as a client--through his false\r\npedigree--of the Umayyad House, to which he was devotedly attached.\r\nBefore the age of thirty he became prime minister of ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán\r\nV (1023-1024 A.D.), but on the fall of the Umayyad Government he retired\r\nfrom public life and gave himself wholly to literature. Ibn Bashkuwál,\r\nauthor of a well-known biographical dictionary of Spanish celebrities\r\nentitled _al-Ṣila fí akhbári a’immati ’l-Andalus_, speaks of him in\r\nthese terms: \"Of all the natives of Spain Ibn Ḥazm was the most\r\neminent by the universality and the depth of his learning in the\r\nsciences cultivated by the Moslems; add to this his profound\r\nacquaintance with the Arabic tongue, and his vast abilities as an\r\nelegant writer, a poet, a biographer, and an historian; his son\r\npossessed about 400 volumes, containing nearly 80,000 leaves, which Ibn\r\nḤazm had composed and written out.\"[784] It is recorded that he said,\r\n\"My only desire in seeking knowledge was to attain a high scientific\r\nrank in this world and the next.\"[785] He got little encouragement from\r\nhis contemporaries. The mere fact that he belonged to the Ẓáhirite\r\nschool of theology would not have mattered, but the caustic style in\r\nwhich he attacked the most venerable religious authorities of Islam\r\naroused such bitter hostility that he was virtually excommunicated by\r\nthe orthodox divines. People were warned against having anything to do\r\nwith him, and at Seville his writings were solemnly committed to the\r\nflames. On this occasion he is said to have remarked--\r\n\r\n \"The paper ye may burn, but what the paper holds\r\n  Ye cannot burn: 'tis safe within my breast: where I\r\n  Remove, it goes with me, alights when I alight,\r\n  And in my tomb will lie.\"[786]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 'The Book of Religions and Sects.']\r\n\r\nAfter being expelled from several provinces of Spain, Ibn Ḥazm\r\nwithdrew to a village, of which he was the owner, and remained there\r\nuntil his death. Of his numerous writings only a few have escaped\r\ndestruction, but fortunately we possess the most valuable of them all,\r\nthe 'Book of Religions and Sects' (_Kitábu ’l-Milal\r\nwa-’l-Niḥal_),[787] which was recently printed in Cairo for the first\r\ntime. This work treats in controversial fashion (1) of the\r\nnon-Muḥammadan religious systems, especially Judaism, Christianity,\r\nand Zoroastrianism, and (2) of Islam and its dogmas, which are of course\r\nregarded from the Ẓáhirite standpoint, and of the four principal\r\nMuḥammadan sects, viz., the Mu‘tazilites, the Murjites, the Shí‘ites,\r\nand the Khárijites. The author maintains that these sects owed their\r\nrise to the Persians, who sought thus to revenge themselves upon\r\nvictorious Islam.[788]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literature in Spain in the eleventh century.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Samuel Ha-Levi.]\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most distinguished Spanish writers of this\r\nepoch: the historian, Abú Marwán Ibn Ḥayyán of Cordova († 1075 A.D.),\r\nwhose chief works are a colossal history of Spain in sixty volumes\r\nentitled _al-Matín_ and a smaller chronicle (_al-Muqtabis_), both of which\r\nappear to have been almost entirely lost;[789] the jurisconsult and\r\npoet, Abu ’l-Walíd al-Bájí († 1081 A.D.); the traditionist Yúsuf Ibn\r\n‘Abd al-Barr († 1071 A.D.); and the geographer al-Bakrí, a native of\r\nCordova, where he died in 1094 A.D. Finally, mention should be made of\r\nthe famous Jews, Solomon Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron) and Samuel Ha-Levi. The\r\nformer, who was born at Malaga about 1020 A.D., wrote two philosophical\r\nworks in Arabic, and his _Fons Vitae_ played an important part in the\r\ndevelopment of mediæval scholasticism. Samuel Ha-Levi was Vizier to\r\nBádís, the sovereign of Granada (1038-1073 A.D.). In their admiration of\r\nhis extraordinary accomplishments the Arabs all but forgot that he was a\r\nJew and a prince (_Naghíd_) in Israel.[790] Samuel, on his part, when he\r\nwrote letters of State, did not scruple to employ the usual\r\nMuḥammadan formulas, \"Praise to Allah!\" \"May Allah bless our Prophet\r\nMuḥammad!\" and to glorify Islam quite in the manner of a good Moslem.\r\nHe had a perfect mastery of Hebrew and Arabic; he knew five other\r\nlanguages, and was profoundly versed in the sciences of the ancients,\r\nparticularly in astronomy. With all his learning he was a supple\r\ndiplomat and a man of the world. Yet he always preserved a dignified and\r\nunassuming demeanour, although in his days (according to Ibnu\r\n’l-‘Idhárí) \"the Jews made themselves powerful and behaved arrogantly\r\ntowards the Moslems.\"[791]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the twelfth, and well into the first half of the\r\nthirteenth, century Spain was ruled by two African dynasties, the\r\nAlmoravides and the Almohades, which originated, as their names denote,\r\nin the religious fanaticism of the Berber tribes of the Sahara. The rise\r\nof the Almoravides is related by Ibnu ’l-Athír as follows:--[792]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Rise of the Almoravides.]\r\n\r\n  \"In this year (448 A.H. = 1056 A.D.) was the beginning of the power\r\n  of the _Mulaththamún_.[793] These were a number of tribes descended\r\n  from Ḥimyar, of which the most considerable were Lamtúna, Jadála,\r\n  and Lamṭa.... Now in the above-mentioned year a man of Jadála,\r\n  named Jawhar, set out for Africa[794] on his way to the Pilgrimage,\r\n  for he loved religion and the people thereof. At Qayrawán he fell in\r\n  with a certain divine--Abú ‘Imrán al-Fásí, as is generally\r\n  supposed--and a company of persons who were studying theology under\r\n  him. Jawhar was much pleased with what he saw of their piety, and on\r\n  his return from Mecca he begged Abú ‘Imrán to send back with him to\r\n  the desert a teacher who should instruct the ignorant Berbers in the\r\n  laws of Islam. So Abú ‘Imrán sent with him a man called ‘Abdulláh b.\r\n  Yásín al-Kuzúlí, who was an excellent divine, and they journeyed\r\n  together until they came to the tribe of Lamtúna. Then Jawhar\r\n  dismounted from his camel and took hold of the bridle of ‘Abdulláh\r\n  b. Yásín's camel, in reverence for the law of Islam; and the men of\r\n  Lamtúna approached Jawhar and greeted him and questioned him\r\n  concerning his companion. 'This man,' he replied, 'is the bearer of\r\n  the Sunna of the Apostle of God: he has come to teach you what is\r\n  necessary in the religion of Islam.' So they bade them both welcome,\r\n  and said to ‘Abdulláh, 'Tell us the law of Islam,' and he explained\r\n  it to them. They answered, 'As to what you have told us of prayer\r\n  and alms-giving, that is easy; but when you say, \"He that kills\r\n  shall be killed, and he that steals shall have his hand cut off, and\r\n  he that commits adultery shall be flogged or stoned,\" that is an\r\n  ordinance which we will not lay upon ourselves. Begone\r\n  elsewhere!'... And they came to Jadála, Jawhar's own tribe, and\r\n  ‘Abdulláh called on them and the neighbouring tribes to fulfil the\r\n  law, and some consented while others refused. Then, after a time,\r\n  ‘Abdulláh said to his followers, 'Ye must fight the enemies of the\r\n  Truth, so appoint a commander over you.' Jawhar answered, 'Thou art\r\n  our commander,' but ‘Abdulláh declared that he was only a\r\n  missionary, and on his advice the command was offered to Abú Bakr b.\r\n  ‘Umar, the chief of Lamtúna, a man of great authority and influence.\r\n  Having prevailed upon him to act as leader, ‘Abdulláh began to\r\n  preach a holy war, and gave his adherents the name of Almoravides\r\n  (_al-Murábitún_).\"[795]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Almoravide Empire (1056-1147 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nThe little community rapidly increased in numbers and power. Yúsuf b.\r\nTáshifín, who succeeded to the command in 1069 A.D., founded the city of\r\nMorocco, and from this centre made new conquests in every direction, so\r\nthat ere long the Almoravides ruled over the whole of North-West Africa\r\nfrom Senegal to Algeria. We have already seen how Yúsuf was invited by\r\nthe ‘Abbádids to lead an army into Spain, how he defeated Alphonso VI at\r\nZalláqa and, returning a few years later, this time not as an ally but\r\nas a conqueror, took possession of Granada and Seville. The rest of\r\nMoslem Spain was subdued without much trouble: laity and clergy alike\r\nhailed in the Berber monarch a zealous reformer of the Faith and a\r\nmighty bulwark against its Christian enemies. The hopeful prospect was\r\nnot realised. Spanish civilisation enervated the Berbers, but did not\r\nrefine them. Under the narrow bigotry of Yúsuf and his successors free\r\nthought became impossible, culture and science faded away. Meanwhile the\r\ncountry was afflicted by famine, brigandage, and all the disorders of a\r\nfeeble and corrupt administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Túmart.]\r\n\r\nThe empire of the Almoravides passed into the hands of another African\r\ndynasty, the Almohades.[796] Their founder, Muḥammad Ibn Túmart, was\r\na native of the mountainous district of Sús which lies to the south-west\r\nof Morocco. When a youth he made the Pilgrimage to Mecca (about 1108\r\nA.D.), and also visited Baghdád, where he studied in the Niẓámiyya\r\nCollege and is said to have met the celebrated Ghazálí. He returned home\r\nwith his head full of theology and ambitious schemes. We need not dwell\r\nupon his career from this point until he finally proclaimed himself as\r\nthe Mahdí (1121 A.D.), nor describe the familiar methods--some of them\r\ndisreputable enough--by which he induced the Berbers to believe in him.\r\nHis doctrines, however, may be briefly stated. \"In most questions,\" says\r\none of his biographers,[797] \"he followed the system of Abu ’l-Ḥasan\r\nal-Ash‘arí, but he agreed with the Mu‘tazilites in their denial of the\r\nDivine Attributes and in a few matters besides; and he was at heart\r\nsomewhat inclined to Shí‘ism, although he gave it no countenance in\r\npublic.\"[798] The gist of his teaching is indicated by the name\r\n_Muwaḥḥid_ (Unitarian), which he bestowed on himself, and which\r\nhis successors adopted as their dynastic title.[799] Ibn Túmart\r\nemphasised the Unity of God; in other words, he denounced the\r\nanthropomorphic ideas which prevailed in Western Islam and strove to\r\nreplace them by a purely spiritual conception of the Deity. To this main\r\ndoctrine he added a second, that of the Infallible Imám (_al-Imám\r\nal-Ma‘ṣúm_), and he naturally asserted that the Imám was Muḥammad\r\nIbn Túmart, a descendant of ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Almohades (1130-1269 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Mahdí (1130 A.D.) the supreme command devolved upon\r\nhis trusted lieutenant, ‘Abdu ’l-Mu’min, who carried on the holy war\r\nagainst the Almoravides with growing success, until in 1158 A.D. he\r\n\"united the whole coast from the frontier of Egypt to the Atlantic,\r\ntogether with Moorish Spain, under his sceptre.\"[800] The new dynasty\r\nwas far more enlightened and favourable to culture than the Almoravides\r\nhad been. Yúsuf, the son of ‘Abdu ’l-Mu’min, is described as an\r\nexcellent scholar, whose mind was stored with the battles and traditions\r\nand history of the Arabs before and after Islam. But he found his\r\nhighest pleasure in the study and patronage of philosophy. The great\r\nAristotelian, Ibn Ṭufayl, was his Vizier and court physician; and Ibn\r\nRushd (Averroes) received flattering honours both from him and from his\r\nsuccessor, Ya‘qúb al-Manṣúr, who loved to converse with the\r\nphilosopher on scientific topics, although in a fit of orthodoxy he\r\nbanished him for a time.[801] This curious mixture of liberality and\r\nintolerance is characteristic of the Almohades. However they might\r\nencourage speculation in its proper place, their law and theology were\r\ncut according to the plain Ẓáhirite pattern. \"The Koran and the\r\nTraditions of the Prophet--or else the sword!\" is a saying of the\r\nlast-mentioned sovereign, who also revived the autos-da-fé, which had\r\nbeen prohibited by his grandfather, of Málikite and other obnoxious\r\nbooks.[802] The spirit of the Almohades is admirably reflected in Ibn\r\nṬufayl's famous philosophical romance, named after its hero, _Ḥayy\r\nibn Yaqẓán_, _i.e._, 'Alive, son of Awake,'[803] of which the\r\nfollowing summary is given by Mr. Duncan B. Macdonald in his excellent\r\n_Muslim Theology_ (p. 253):--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The story of Ḥayy b. Yaqẓán.]\r\n\r\n  \"In it he conceives two islands, the one inhabited and the other\r\n  not. On the inhabited island we have conventional people living\r\n  conventional lives, and restrained by a conventional religion of\r\n  rewards and punishments. Two men there, Salámán and Asál,[804] have\r\n  raised themselves to a higher level of self-rule. Salámán adapts\r\n  himself externally to the popular religion and rules the people;\r\n  Asál, seeking to perfect himself still further in solitude, goes to\r\n  the other island. But there he finds a man, Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓán,\r\n  who has lived alone from infancy and has gradually, by the innate\r\n  and uncorrupted powers of the mind, developed himself to the highest\r\n  philosophic level and reached the Vision of the Divine. He has\r\n  passed through all the stages of knowledge until the universe lies\r\n  clear before him, and now he finds that his philosophy thus reached,\r\n  without prophet or revelation, and the purified religion of Asál are\r\n  one and the same. The story told by Asál of the people of the other\r\n  island sitting in darkness stirs his soul, and he goes forth to them\r\n  as a missionary. But he soon learns that the method of Muḥammad\r\n  was the true one for the great masses, and that only by sensuous\r\n  allegory and concrete things could they be reached and held. He\r\n  retires to his island again to live the solitary life.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literature under the Almoravides and Almohades (1100-1250\r\nA.D.).]\r\n\r\nOf the writers who flourished under the Berber dynasties few are\r\nsufficiently important to deserve mention in a work of this kind. The\r\nphilosophers, however, stand in a class by themselves. Ibn Bájja\r\n(Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Ibn Ṭufayl, and Músá b. Maymún\r\n(Maimonides) made their influence felt far beyond the borders of Spain:\r\nthey belong, in a sense, to Europe. We have noticed elsewhere the great\r\nmystic, Muḥyi ’l-Dín Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí († 1240 A.D.); his\r\nfellow-townsman, Ibn Sab‘ín († 1269 A.D.), a thinker of the same type,\r\nwrote letters on philosophical subjects to Frederick II of Hohenstaufen.\r\nValuable works on the literary history of Spain were composed by Ibn\r\nKháqán († 1134 A.D.), Ibn Bassám († 1147 A.D.), and Ibn Bashkuwál (†\r\n1183 A.D.). The geographer Idrísí († 1154 A.D.) was born at Ceuta,\r\nstudied at Cordova, and found a patron in the Sicilian monarch, Roger\r\nII; Ibn Jubayr published an interesting account of his pilgrimage from\r\nGranada to Mecca and of his journey back to Granada during the years\r\n1183-1185 A.D.; Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar), who became a Vizier under the\r\nAlmoravides, was the first of a whole family of eminent physicians; and\r\nIbnu ’l-Bayṭár of Malaga († 1248 A.D.), after visiting Egypt, Greece,\r\nand Asia Minor in order to extend his knowledge of botany, compiled a\r\nMateria Medica, which he dedicated to the Sultan of Egypt, Malik\r\nal-Kámil.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconquest of Spain by Ferdinand III.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Naṣrids of Granada (1232-1492 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nWe have now taken a rapid survey of the Moslem empire in Spain from its\r\nrise in the eighth century of our era down to the last days of the\r\nAlmohades, which saw the Christian arms everywhere triumphant. By 1230\r\nA.D. the Almohades had been driven out of the peninsula, although they\r\ncontinued to rule Africa for about forty years after this date. Amidst\r\nthe general wreck one spot remained where the Moors could find shelter.\r\nThis was Granada. Here, in 1232 A.D., Muḥammad Ibnu ’l-Aḥmar\r\nassumed the proud title of 'Conqueror by Grace of God' (_Ghálib billáh_)\r\nand founded the Naṣrid dynasty, which held the Christians at bay\r\nduring two centuries and a half. That the little Moslem kingdom survived\r\nso long was not due to its own strength, but rather to its almost\r\nimpregnable situation and to the dissensions of the victors. The latest\r\nbloom of Arabic culture in Europe renewed, if it did not equal, the\r\nglorious memories of Cordova and Seville. In this period arose the\r\nworld-renowned Alhambra, _i.e._, 'the Red Palace' (al-Ḥamrá) of the\r\nNaṣrid kings, and many other superb monuments of which the ruins are\r\nstill visible. We must not, however, be led away into a digression even\r\nupon such a fascinating subject as Moorish architecture. Our information\r\nconcerning literary matters is scantier than it might have been, on\r\naccount of the vandalism practised by the Christians when they took\r\nGranada. It is no dubious legend (like the reputed burning of the\r\nAlexandrian Library by order of the Caliph ‘Umar),[805] but a\r\nwell-ascertained fact that the ruthless Archbishop Ximenez made a\r\nbonfire of all the Arabic manuscripts on which he could lay his hands.\r\nHe wished to annihilate the record of seven centuries of Muḥammadan\r\nculture in a single day.\r\n\r\nThe names of Ibnu ’l-Khaṭíb and Ibn Khaldún represent the highest\r\nliterary accomplishment and historical comprehension of which this age\r\nwas capable. The latter, indeed, has no parallel among Oriental\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibnu ’l-Khaṭíb (1313-1374 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nLisánu ’l-Dín Ibnu ’l-Khaṭíb[806] played a great figure in the\r\npolitics of his time, and his career affords a conspicuous example of\r\nthe intimate way in which Moslem poetry and literature are connected\r\nwith public life. \"The Arabs did not share the opinion widely spread\r\nnowadays, that poetical talent flourishes best in seclusion from the\r\ntumult of the world, or that it dims the clearness of vision which is\r\nrequired for the conduct of public affairs. On the contrary, their\r\nprinces entrusted the chief offices of State to poets, and poetry often\r\nserved as a means to obtain more brilliant results than diplomatic notes\r\ncould have procured.\"[807] A young man like Ibnu ’l-Khaṭíb, who had\r\nmastered the entire field of belles-lettres, who improvised odes and\r\nrhyming epistles with incomparable elegance and facility, was marked out\r\nto be the favourite of kings. He became Vizier at the Naṣrid court, a\r\nposition which he held, with one brief interval of disgrace, until 1371\r\nA.D., when the intrigues of his enemies forced him to flee from Granada.\r\nHe sought refuge at Fez, and was honourably received by the reigning\r\nSultan, ‘Abdu ’l-‘Azíz; but on the accession of Abu ’l-‘Abbás in 1374\r\nA.D. the exiled minister was incarcerated and brought to trial on the\r\ncharge of heresy (_zandaqa_). While the inquisition was proceeding a\r\nfanatical mob broke into the gaol and murdered him. Maqqarí relates that\r\nIbnu ’l-Khaṭib suffered from insomnia, and that most of his works\r\nwere composed during the night, for which reason he got the nickname of\r\n_Dhu ’l-‘Umrayn_, or 'The man of two lives.'[808] He was a prolific\r\nwriter in various branches of literature, but, like so many of his\r\ncountrymen, he excelled in History. His monographs on the sovereigns and\r\nsavants of Granada (one of which includes an autobiography) supply\r\ninteresting details concerning this obscure period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Khaldún (1332-1406 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nSome apology may be thought necessary for placing Ibn Khaldún, the\r\ngreatest historical thinker of Islam, in the present chapter, as though\r\nhe were a Spaniard either by birth or residence. He descended, it is true,\r\nfrom a family, the Banú Khaldún, which had long been settled in Spain,\r\nfirst at Carmona and afterwards at Seville; but they migrated to Africa\r\nabout the middle of the thirteenth century, and Ibn Khaldún was born at\r\nTunis. Nearly the whole of his life, moreover, was passed in Africa--a\r\ncircumstance due rather to accident than to predilection; for in 1362\r\nA.D. he entered the service of the Sultan of Granada, Abú ‘Abdalláh Ibnu\r\n’l-Aḥmar, and would probably have made that city his home had not the\r\njealousy of his former friend, the Vizier Ibnu ’l-Khaṭíb, decided him\r\nto leave Spain behind. We cannot give any account of the agitated and\r\neventful career which he ended, as Cadi of Cairo, in 1406 A.D. Ibn\r\nKhaldún lived with statesmen and kings: he was an ambassador to the\r\ncourt of Pedro of Castile, and an honoured guest of the mighty\r\nTamerlane. The results of his ripe experience are marvellously displayed\r\nin the Prolegomena (_Muqaddima_), which forms the first volume of a huge\r\ngeneral history entitled the _Kitábu ’l-‘Ibar_ ('Book of\r\nExamples').[809] He himself has stated his idea of the historian's\r\nfunction in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Ibn Khaldún as a philosophical historian.]\r\n\r\n  \"Know that the true purpose of history is to make us acquainted with\r\n  human society, _i.e._, with the civilisation of the world, and with\r\n  its natural phenomena, such as savage life, the softening of\r\n  manners, attachment to the family and the tribe, the various kinds\r\n  of superiority which one people gains over another, the kingdoms and\r\n  diverse dynasties which arise in this way, the different trades and\r\n  laborious occupations to which men devote themselves in order to\r\n  earn their livelihood, the sciences and arts; in fine, all the\r\n  manifold conditions which naturally occur in the development of\r\n  civilisation.\"[810]\r\n\r\nIbn Khaldún argues that History, thus conceived, is subject to universal\r\nlaws, and in these laws he finds the only sure criterion of historical\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: His canons of historical criticism.]\r\n\r\n  \"The rule for distinguishing what is true from what is false in\r\n  history is based on its possibility or impossibility: that is to\r\n  say, we must examine human society (civilisation) and discriminate\r\n  between the characteristics which are essential and inherent in its\r\n  nature and those which are accidental and need not be taken into\r\n  account, recognising further those which cannot possibly belong to\r\n  it. If we do this we have a rule for separating historical truth\r\n  from error by means of a demonstrative method that admits of no\r\n  doubt.... It is a genuine touchstone whereby historians may verify\r\n  whatever they relate.\"[811]\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, the writer claims too much, and it must be allowed that he\r\noccasionally applied his principles in a pedantic fashion, and was led\r\nby purely _a priori_ considerations to conclusions which are not always\r\nso warrantable as he believed. This is a very trifling matter in\r\ncomparison with the value and originality of the principles themselves.\r\nIbn Khaldún asserts, with justice, that he has discovered a new method\r\nof writing history. No Moslem had ever taken a view at once so\r\ncomprehensive and so philosophical; none had attempted to trace the\r\ndeeply hidden causes of events, to expose the moral and spiritual forces\r\nat work beneath the surface, or to divine the immutable laws of national\r\nprogress and decay. Ibn Khaldún owed little to his predecessors,\r\nalthough he mentions some of them with respect. He stood far above his\r\nage, and his own countrymen have admired rather than followed him. His\r\nintellectual descendants are the great mediæval and modern historians of\r\nEurope--Machiavelli and Vico and Gibbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Kaldún's theory of historical evolution.]\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to sketch briefly the peculiar theory of historical\r\ndevelopment which Ibn Khaldún puts forward in his Prolegomena--a theory\r\nfounded on the study of actual conditions and events either past or\r\npassing before his eyes.[812] He was struck, in the first place, with\r\nthe physical fact that in almost every part of the Muḥammadan Empire\r\ngreat wastes of sand or stony plateaux, arid and incapable of tillage,\r\nwedge themselves between fertile domains of cultivated land. The former\r\nwere inhabited from time immemorial by nomad tribes, the latter by an\r\nagricultural or industrial population; and we have seen, in the case of\r\nArabia, that cities like Mecca and Ḥíra carried on a lively\r\nintercourse with the Bedouins and exerted a civilising influence upon\r\nthem. In Africa the same contrast was strongly marked. It is no wonder,\r\ntherefore, that Ibn Khaldún divided the whole of mankind into two\r\nclasses--Nomads and Citizens. The nomadic life naturally precedes and\r\nproduces the other. Its characteristics are simplicity and purity of\r\nmanners, warlike spirit, and, above all, a loyal devotion to the\r\ninterests of the family and the tribe. As the nomads become more\r\ncivilised they settle down, form states, and make conquests. They have\r\nnow reached their highest development. Corrupted by luxury, and losing\r\nthe virtues which raised them to power, they are soon swept away by a\r\nruder people. Such, in bare outline, is the course of history as Ibn\r\nKhaldún regards it; but we must try to give our readers some further\r\naccount of the philosophical ideas underlying his conception. He\r\ndiscerns, in the life of tribes and nations alike, two dominant forces\r\nwhich mould their destiny. The primitive and cardinal force he calls\r\n_‘aṣabiyya_, the _binding_ element in society, the feeling which\r\nunites members of the same family, tribe, nation, or empire, and which\r\nin its widest acceptation is equivalent to the modern term, Patriotism.\r\nIt springs up and especially flourishes among nomad peoples, where the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation awakens a keen sense of kinship and drives\r\nmen to make common cause with each other. This _‘aṣabiyya_ is the\r\nvital energy of States: by it they rise and grow; as it weakens they\r\ndecline; and its decay is the signal for their fall. The second of the\r\nforces referred to is Religion. Ibn Khaldún hardly ascribes to religion\r\nso much influence as we might have expected from a Moslem. He\r\nrecognises, however, that it may be the only means of producing that\r\nsolidarity without which no State can exist. Thus in the twenty-seventh\r\nchapter of his _Muqaddima_ he lays down the proposition that \"the Arabs\r\nare incapable of founding an empire unless they are imbued with\r\nreligious enthusiasm by a prophet or a saint.\"\r\n\r\nIn History he sees an endless cycle of progress and retrogression,\r\nanalogous to the phenomena of human life. Kingdoms are born, attain\r\nmaturity, and die within a definite period which rarely exceeds three\r\ngenerations, _i.e._, 120 years.[813] During this time they pass through\r\nfive stages of development and decay.[814] It is noteworthy that Ibn\r\nKhaldún admits the moral superiority of the Nomads. For him civilisation\r\nnecessarily involves corruption and degeneracy. If he did not believe in\r\nthe gradual advance of mankind towards some higher goal, his pessimism\r\nwas justified by the lessons of experience and by the mournful plight of\r\nthe Muḥammadan world, to which his view was restricted.[815]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of Granada (1492 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nIn 1492 A.D. the last stronghold of the European Arabs opened its gates\r\nto Ferdinand and Isabella, and \"the Cross supplanted the Crescent on the\r\ntowers of Granada.\" The victors showed a barbarous fanaticism that was\r\nthe more abominable as it violated their solemn pledges to respect the\r\nreligion and property of the Moslems, and as it utterly reversed the\r\ntolerant and liberal treatment which the Christians of Spain had enjoyed\r\nunder Muḥammadan rule. Compelled to choose between apostasy and exile,\r\nmany preferred the latter alternative. Those who remained were subjected\r\nto a terrible persecution, until in 1609 A.D., by order of Philip III,\r\nthe Moors were banished _en masse_ from Spanish soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Arabs in Sicily.]\r\n\r\nSpain was not the sole point whence Moslem culture spread itself over\r\nthe Christian lands. Sicily was conquered by the Aghlabids of Tunis\r\nearly in the ninth century, and although the island fell into the hands\r\nof the Normans in 1071 A.D., the court of Palermo retained a\r\nsemi-Oriental character. Here in the reign of Frederick II of\r\nHohenstaufen (1194-1250 A.D.) might be seen \"astrologers from Baghdád\r\nwith long beards and waving robes, Jews who received princely salaries\r\nas translators of Arabic works, Saracen dancers and dancing-girls, and\r\nMoors who blew silver trumpets on festal occasions.\"[816] Both Frederick\r\nhimself and his son Manfred were enthusiastic Arabophiles, and\r\nscandalised Christendom by their assumption of 'heathen' manners as well\r\nas by the attention which they devoted to Moslem philosophy and science.\r\nUnder their auspices Arabic learning was communicated to the\r\nneighbouring towns of Lower Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFROM THE MONGOL INVASION TO THE PRESENT DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General characteristics of the period.]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to speak of the terrible catastrophe which filled the\r\nwhole of Western Asia with ruin and desolation, I may offer a few\r\npreliminary remarks concerning the general character of the period which\r\nwe shall briefly survey in this final chapter. It forms, one must admit,\r\na melancholy conclusion to a glorious history. The Caliphate, which\r\nsymbolised the supremacy of the Prophet's people, is swept away.\r\nMongols, Turks, Persians, all in turn build up great Muḥammadan\r\nempires, but the Arabs have lost even the shadow of a leading part and\r\nappear only as subordinate actors on a provincial stage. The chief\r\ncentres of Arabian life, such as it is, are henceforth Syria and Egypt,\r\nwhich were held by the Turkish Mamelukes until 1517 A.D., when they\r\npassed under Ottoman rule. In North Africa the petty Berber dynasties\r\n(Ḥafṣids, Ziyánids, and Marínids) gave place in the sixteenth\r\ncentury to the Ottoman Turks. Only in Spain, where the Naṣrids of\r\nGranada survived until 1492 A.D., in Morocco, where the Sharífs\r\n(descendants of ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib) assumed the sovereignty in 1544\r\nA.D., and to some extent in Arabia itself, did the Arabs preserve their\r\npolitical independence. In such circumstances it would be vain to look\r\nfor any large developments of literature and culture worthy to rank with\r\nthose of the past. This is an age of imitation and compilation. Learned\r\nmen abound, whose erudition embraces every subject under the sun. The\r\nmass of writing shows no visible diminution, and much of it is valuable\r\nand meritorious work. But with one or two conspicuous exceptions--_e.g._\r\nthe historian Ibn Khaldún and the mystic Sha‘rání--we cannot point to\r\nany new departure, any fruitful ideas, any trace of original and\r\nilluminating thought. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries \"witnessed\r\nthe rise and triumph of that wonderful movement known as the\r\nRenaissance,... but no ripple of this great upheaval, which changed the\r\nwhole current of intellectual and moral life in the West, reached the\r\nshores of Islam.\"[817] Until comparatively recent times, when Egypt and\r\nSyria first became open to European civilisation, the Arab retained his\r\nmediæval outlook and habit of mind, and was in no respect more\r\nenlightened than his forefathers who lived under the ‘Abbásid Caliphate.\r\nAnd since the Mongol Invasion I am afraid we must say that instead of\r\nadvancing farther along the old path he was being forced back by the\r\ninevitable pressure of events. East of the Euphrates the Mongols did\r\ntheir work of destruction so thoroughly that no seeds were left from\r\nwhich a flourishing civilisation could arise; and, moreover, the Arabic\r\nlanguage was rapidly extinguished by the Persian. In Spain, as we have\r\nseen, the power of the Arabs had already begun to decline; Africa was\r\ndominated by the Berbers, a rude, unlettered race, Egypt and Syria by\r\nthe blighting military despotism of the Turks. Nowhere in the history of\r\nthis period can we discern either of the two elements which are most\r\nproductive of literary greatness: the quickening influence of a higher\r\nculture or the inspiration of a free and vigorous national life.[818]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mongol Invasion.]\r\n\r\nBetween the middle of the eleventh century and the end of the fourteenth\r\nthe nomad tribes dwelling beyond the Oxus burst over Western Asia in\r\nthree successive waves. First came the Seljúq Turks, then the Mongols\r\nunder Chingíz Khan and Húlágú, then the hordes, mainly Turkish, of\r\nTímúr. Regarding the Seljúqs all that is necessary for our purpose has\r\nbeen said in a former chapter. The conquests of Tímúr are a frightful\r\nepisode which I may be pardoned for omitting from this history, inasmuch\r\nas their permanent results (apart from the enormous damage which they\r\ninflicted) were inconsiderable; and although the Indian empire of the\r\nGreat Moguls, which Bábur, a descendant of Tímúr, established in the\r\nfirst half of the sixteenth century, ran a prosperous and brilliant\r\ncourse, its culture was borrowed almost exclusively from Persian models\r\nand does not come within the scope of the present work. We shall,\r\ntherefore, confine our view to the second wave of the vast Asiatic\r\nmigration, which bore the Mongols, led by Chingíz Khan and Húlágú, from\r\nthe steppes of China and Tartary to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chingíz Khan and Húlágú.]\r\n\r\nIn 1219 A.D. Chingíz Khan, having consolidated his power in the Far\r\nEast, turned his face westward and suddenly advanced into Transoxania,\r\nwhich at that time formed a province of the wide dominions of the Sháhs\r\nof Khwárizm (Khiva). The reigning monarch, ‘Alá’u ’l-Dín Muḥammad,\r\nwas unable to make an effective resistance; and notwithstanding that his\r\nson, the gallant Jalálu ’l-Dín, carried on a desperate guerilla for\r\ntwelve years, the invaders swarmed over Khurásán and Persia, massacring\r\nthe panic-stricken inhabitants wholesale and leaving a wilderness behind\r\nthem. Hitherto Baghdád had not been seriously threatened, but on the\r\nfirst day of January, 1256 A.D.--an epoch-marking date--Húlágú, the\r\ngrandson of Chingíz Khan, crossed the Oxus, with the intention of\r\noccupying the ‘Abbásid capital. I translate the following narrative from\r\na manuscript in my possession of the _Ta’ríkh al-Khamís_ by Diyárbakrí\r\n(† 1574 A.D.):--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Húlágú before Baghdád (1258 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Sack of Baghdád.]\r\n\r\n  In the year 654 (A.H. = 1256 A.D.) the stubborn tyrant, Húlágú, the\r\n  destroyer of the nations (_Mubídu ’l-Umam_), set forth and took the\r\n  castle of Alamút from the Ismá‘ílís[819] and slew them and laid\r\n  waste the lands of Rayy.... And in the year 655 there broke out at\r\n  Baghdád a fearful riot between the Sunnís and the Shí‘ites, which\r\n  led to great plunder and destruction of property. A number of\r\n  Shí‘ites were killed, and this so incensed and infuriated the Vizier\r\n  Ibnu ’l-‘Alqami that he encouraged the Tartars to invade ‘Iráq, by\r\n  which means he hoped to take ample vengeance on the Sunnís.[820] And\r\n  in the beginning of the year 656 the tyrant Húlágú b. Túlí b.\r\n  Chingíz Khán, the Moghul, arrived at Baghdád with his army,\r\n  including the Georgians (_al-Kurj_) and the troops of Mosul. The\r\n  Dawídár[821] marched out of the city and met Húlágú's vanguard,\r\n  which was commanded by Bájú.[822] The Moslems, being few, suffered\r\n  defeat; whereupon Bájú advanced and pitched his camp to the west of\r\n  Baghdád, while Húlágú took up a position on the eastern side. Then\r\n  the Vizier Ibnu ’l-‘Alqamí said to the Caliph Musta‘ṣim Billáh: \"I\r\n  will go to the Supreme Khán to arrange peace.\" So the hound[823]\r\n  went and obtained security for himself, and on his return said to\r\n  the Caliph: \"The Khán desires to marry his daughter to your son and\r\n  to render homage to you, like the Seljúq kings, and then to depart.\"\r\n  Musta‘ṣim set out, attended by the nobles of his court and the\r\n  grandees of his time, in order to witness the contract of marriage.\r\n  The whole party were beheaded except the Caliph, who was trampled to\r\n  death. The Tartars entered Baghdád and distributed themselves in\r\n  bands throughout the city. For thirty-four days the sword was never\r\n  sheathed. Few escaped. The slain amounted to 1,800,000 and more.\r\n  Then quarter was called.... Thus it is related in the _Duwalu\r\n  ’l-Islám_.[824]... And on this wise did the Caliphate pass from\r\n  Baghdád. As the poet sings:--\r\n\r\n   \"_Khalati ’l-manábiru wa-’l-asirralu minhumú\r\n     wa-‘alayhimú hatta ’l-mamáti salámú._\"\r\n\r\n   \"_The pulpits and the thrones are empty of them;\r\n     I bid them, till the hour of death, farewell!_\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of ‘Ayn Jálút (September, 1260 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabic ceases to be the language of the whole Moslem world.]\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if all Muḥammadan Asia lay at the feet of the pagan\r\nconqueror. Resuming his advance, Húlágú occupied Mesopotamia and sacked\r\nAleppo. He then returned to the East, leaving his lieutenant, Ketboghá,\r\nto complete the reduction of Syria. Meanwhile, however, an Egyptian army\r\nunder the Mameluke Sultan Muẓaffar Quṭuz was hastening to oppose\r\nthe invaders. On Friday, the 25th of Ramaḍán, 658 A.H., a decisive\r\nbattle was fought at ‘Ayn Jálút (Goliath's Spring), west of the Jordan.\r\nThe Tartars were routed with immense slaughter, and their subsequent\r\nattempts to wrest Syria from the Mamelukes met with no success. The\r\nsubmission of Asia Minor was hardly more than nominal, but in Persia the\r\ndescendants of Húlágú, the Íl-Kháns, reigned over a great empire, which\r\nthe conversion of one of their number, Gházán (1295-1304 A.D.), restored\r\nto Moslem rule. We are not concerned here with the further history of\r\nthe Mongols in Persia nor with that of the Persians themselves. Since\r\nthe days of Húlágú the lands east and west of the Tigris are separated\r\nby an ever-widening gulf. The two races--Persians and Arabs--to whose\r\nco-operation the mediæval world, from Samarcand to Seville, for a long\r\ntime owed its highest literary and scientific culture, have now finally\r\ndissolved their partnership. It is true that the cleavage began many\r\ncenturies earlier, and before the fall of Baghdád the Persian genius had\r\nalready expressed itself in a splendid national literature. But from\r\nthis date onward the use of Arabic by Persians is practically limited to\r\ntheological and philosophical writings. The Persian language has driven\r\nits rival out of the field. Accordingly Egypt and Syria will now demand\r\nthe principal share of our attention, more especially as the history of\r\nthe Arabs of Granada, which properly belongs to this period, has been\r\nrelated in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mamelukes of Egypt (1250-1517 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sultan Baybars (1260-1277 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ‘Abbásid Caliphs of Egypt.]\r\n\r\nThe dynasty of the Mameluke[825] Sultans of Egypt was founded in 1250\r\nA.D. by Aybak, a Turkish slave, who commenced his career in the service\r\nof the Ayyúbid, Malik Ṣáliḥ Najmu ’l-Dín. His successors[826] held\r\nsway in Egypt and Syria until the conquest of these countries by the\r\nOttomans. The Mamelukes were rough soldiers, who seldom indulged in any\r\nuseless refinement, but they had a royal taste for architecture, as the\r\nvisitor to Cairo may still see. Their administration, though disturbed\r\nby frequent mutinies and murders, was tolerably prosperous on the whole,\r\nand their victories over the Mongol hosts, as well as the crushing blows\r\nwhich they dealt to the Crusaders, gave Islam new prestige. The ablest\r\nof them all was Baybars, who richly deserved his title Malik\r\nal-Ẓáhir, _i.e._, the Victorious King. His name has passed into the\r\nlegends of the people, and his warlike exploits into romances written in\r\nthe vulgar dialect which are recited by story-tellers to this day.[827]\r\nThe violent and brutal acts which he sometimes committed--for he shrank\r\nfrom no crime when he suspected danger--made him a terror to the\r\nambitious nobles around him, but did not harm his reputation as a just\r\nruler. Although he held the throne in virtue of having murdered the late\r\nmonarch with his own hand, he sought to give the appearance of\r\nlegitimacy to his usurpation. He therefore recognised as Caliph a\r\ncertain Abu ’l-Qásim Aḥmad, a pretended scion of the ‘Abbásid house,\r\ninvited him to Cairo, and took the oath of allegiance to him in due\r\nform. The Caliph on his part invested the Sultan with sovereignty over\r\nEgypt, Syria, Arabia, and all the provinces that he might obtain by\r\nfuture conquests. This Aḥmad, entitled al-Mustanṣir, was the first\r\nof a long series of mock Caliphs who were appointed by the Mameluke\r\nSultans and generally kept under close surveillance in the citadel of\r\nCairo. There is no authority for the statement, originally made by\r\nMouradgea d'Ohsson in 1787 and often repeated since, that the last of\r\nthe line bequeathed his rights of succession to the Ottoman Sultan Selím\r\nI, thus enabling the Sultans of Turkey to claim the title and dignity of\r\nCaliph.[828]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabic poetry after the Mongol Invasion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ṣafiyyu ’l-Dín al-Ḥillí.]\r\n\r\nThe poets of this period are almost unknown in Europe, and until they\r\nhave been studied with due attention it would be premature to assert\r\nthat none of them rises above mediocrity. At the same time my own\r\nimpression (based, I confess, on a very desultory and imperfect\r\nacquaintance with their work) is that the best among them are merely\r\nelegant and accomplished artists, playing brilliantly with words and\r\nphrases, but doing little else. No doubt extreme artificiality may\r\ncoexist with poetical genius of a high order, provided that it has\r\nbehind it Mutanabbí's power, Ma‘arrí's earnestness, or Ibnu\r\n’l-Fáriḍ's enthusiasm. In the absence of these qualities we must be\r\ncontent to admire the technical skill with which the old tunes are\r\nvaried and revived. Let us take, for example, Ṣafiyyu ’l-Dín\r\nal-Ḥillí, who was born at Ḥilla, a large town on the Euphrates, in\r\n1278 A.D., became laureate of the Urtuqid dynasty at Máridín, and died\r\nin Baghdád about 1350. He is described as \"the poet of his age\r\nabsolutely,\" and to judge from the extracts in Kutubí's _Fawátu\r\n’l-Wafayát_[829] he combined subtlety of fancy with remarkable ease and\r\nsweetness of versification. Many of his pieces, however, are _jeux\r\nd'esprit_, like his ode to the Prophet, in which he employs 151\r\nrhetorical figures, or like another poem where all the nouns are\r\ndiminutives.[830] The following specimen of his work is too brief to do\r\nhim justice:--\r\n\r\n \"How can I have patience, and thou, mine eye's delight,\r\n  All the livelong year not one moment in my sight?\r\n  And with what can I rejoice my heart, when thou that art a joy\r\n  Unto every human heart, from me hast taken flight?\r\n  I swear by Him who made thy form the envy of the sun\r\n  (So graciously He clad thee with lovely beams of light):\r\n  The day when I behold thy beauty doth appear to me\r\n  As tho' it gleamed on Time's dull brow a constellation bright.\r\n  O thou scorner of my passion, for whose sake I count as naught\r\n  All the woe that I endure, all the injury and despite,\r\n  Come, regard the ways of God! for never He at life's last gasp\r\n  Suffereth the weight to perish even of one mite!\"[831]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular poetry.]\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the folk-songs (_muwashshaḥ_ and _zajal_)\r\nwhich originated in Spain. These simple ballads, with their novel metres\r\nand incorrect language, were despised by the classical school, that is\r\nto say, by nearly all Moslems with any pretensions to learning; but\r\ntheir popularity was such that even the court poets occasionally\r\ncondescended to write in this style. To the _zajal_ and _muwashshaḥ_\r\nwe may add the _dúbayt_, the _mawáliyyá_, the _kánwakán_, and the\r\n_ḥimáq_, which together with verse of the regular form made up the\r\n'seven kinds of poetry' (_al-funún al-sab‘a_). Ṣafiyyu ’l-Dín\r\nal-Ḥillí, who wrote a special treatise on the Arabic folk-songs,\r\nmentions two other varieties which, he says, were invented by the people\r\nof Baghdád to be sung in the early dawn of Ramaḍán, the Moslem\r\nLent.[832] It is interesting to observe that some few literary men\r\nattempted, though in a timid fashion, to free Arabic poetry from the\r\nbenumbing academic system by which it was governed and to pour fresh\r\nlife into its veins. A notable example of this tendency is the _Hazzu\r\n’l-Quḥúf_[833] by Shirbíní, who wrote in 1687 A.D. Here we have a\r\npoem in the vulgar dialect of Egypt, but what is still more curious, the\r\nauthor, while satirising the uncouth manners and rude language of the\r\npeasantry, makes a bitter attack on the learning and morals of the\r\nMuḥammadan divines.[834] For this purpose he introduces a typical\r\nFellah named Abú Shádúf, whose rôle corresponds to that of Piers the\r\nPlowman in Longland's _Vision_. Down to the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, at any rate, such isolated offshoots had not gone far to found\r\na living school of popular poetry. Only the future can show whether the\r\nArabs are capable of producing a genius who will succeed in doing for\r\nthe national folk-songs what Burns did for the Scots ballads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Khallikán (1211-1282 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nBiography and History were cultivated with ardour by the savants of\r\nEgypt and Syria. Among the numerous compositions of this kind we can\r\nhave no hesitation in awarding the place of honour to the _Wafayátu\r\n’l-A‘yán_, or 'Obituaries of Eminent Men,' by Shamsu ’l-Dín Ibn\r\nKhallikán, a work which has often been quoted in the foregoing pages.\r\nThe author belonged to a distinguished family descending from Yaḥyá\r\nb. Khálid the Barmecide (see p. 259 seq.), and was born at Arbela in\r\n1211 A.D. He received his education at Aleppo and Damascus (1229-1238)\r\nand then proceeded to Cairo, where he finished the first draft of his\r\nBiographical Dictionary in 1256. Five years later he was appointed by\r\nSultan Baybars to be Chief Cadi of Syria. He retained this high office\r\n(with a seven years' interval, which he devoted to literary and\r\nbiographical studies) until a short time before his death. In the\r\nPreface to the _Wafayát_ Ibn Khallikán observes that he has adopted the\r\nalphabetical order as more convenient than the chronological. As regards\r\nthe scope and character of his Dictionary, he says:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: His Biographical Dictionary.]\r\n\r\n  \"I have not limited my work to the history of any one particular\r\n  class of persons, as learned men, princes, emirs, viziers, or poets;\r\n  but I have spoken of all those whose names are familiar to the\r\n  public, and about whom questions are frequently asked; I have,\r\n  however, related the facts I could ascertain respecting them in a\r\n  concise manner, lest my work should become too voluminous; I have\r\n  fixed with all possible exactness the dates of their birth and\r\n  death; I have traced up their genealogy as high as I could; I have\r\n  marked the orthography of those names which are liable to be written\r\n  incorrectly; and I have cited the traits which may best serve to\r\n  characterise each individual, such as noble actions, singular\r\n  anecdotes, verses and letters, so that the reader may derive\r\n  amusement from my work, and find it not exclusively of such a\r\n  uniform cast as would prove tiresome; for the most effectual\r\n  inducement to reading a book arises from the variety of its\r\n  style.\"[835]\r\n\r\nIbn Khallikan might have added that he was the first Muḥammadan\r\nwriter to design a Dictionary of National Biography, since none of his\r\npredecessors had thought of comprehending the lives of eminent Moslems\r\nof every class in a single work.[836] The merits of the book have been\r\nfully recognised by the author's countrymen as well as by European\r\nscholars. It is composed in simple and elegant language, it is extremely\r\naccurate, and it contains an astonishing quantity of miscellaneous\r\nhistorical and literary information, not drily catalogued but conveyed\r\nin the most pleasing fashion by anecdotes and excerpts which illustrate\r\nevery department of Moslem life. I am inclined to agree with the opinion\r\nof Sir William Jones, that it is the best general biography ever\r\nwritten; and allowing for the difference of scale and scope, I think it\r\nwill bear comparison with a celebrated English work which it resembles\r\nin many ways--I mean Boswell's _Johnson_.[837]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historians of the Mameluke period.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maqrízí.]\r\n\r\nTo give an adequate account of the numerous and talented historians of\r\nthe Mameluke period would require far more space than they can\r\nreasonably claim in a review of this kind. Concerning Ibn Khaldún, who\r\nheld a professorship as well as the office of Cadi in Cairo under Sultan\r\nBarqúq (1382-1398 A.D.), we have already spoken at some length. This\r\nextraordinary genius discovered principles and methods which might have\r\nbeen expected to revolutionise historical science, but neither was he\r\nhimself capable of carrying them into effect nor, as the event proved,\r\ndid they inspire his successors to abandon the path of tradition. I\r\ncannot imagine any more decisive symptom of the intellectual lethargy in\r\nwhich Islam was now sunk, or any clearer example of the rule that even\r\nthe greatest writers struggle in vain against the spirit of their own\r\ntimes. There were plenty of learned men, however, who compiled local and\r\nuniversal histories. Considering the precious materials which their\r\nindustry has preserved for us, we should rather admire these diligent\r\nand erudite authors than complain of their inability to break away from\r\nthe established mode. Perhaps the most famous among them is Taqiyyu\r\n’l-Dín al-Maqrízí (1364-1442 A.D.). A native of Cairo, he devoted\r\nhimself to Egyptian history and antiquities, on which subject he\r\ncomposed several standard works, such as the _Khiṭaṭ_[838] and the\r\n_Sulúk_.[839] Although he was both unconscientious and uncritical, too\r\noften copying without acknowledgment or comment, and indulging in\r\nwholesale plagiarism when it suited his purpose, these faults which are\r\ncharacteristic of his age may easily be excused. \"He has accumulated and\r\nreduced to a certain amount of order a large quantity of information\r\nthat would but for him have passed into oblivion. He is generally\r\npainstaking and accurate, and always resorts to contemporary evidence if\r\nit is available. Also he has a pleasant and lucid style, and writes\r\nwithout bias and apparently with distinguished impartiality.\"[840] Other\r\nwell-known works belonging to this epoch are the _Fakhrí_ of Ibnu\r\n’l-Ṭiqṭaqá, a delightful manual of Muḥammadan politics[841]\r\nwhich was written at Mosul in 1302 A.D.; the epitome of universal\r\nhistory by Abu ’l-Fidá, Prince of Ḥamát († 1331); the voluminous\r\nChronicle of Islam by Dhahabí († 1348); the high-flown Biography of\r\nTímúr entitled _‘Ajá’ibu ’l-Maqdúr_, or 'Marvels of Destiny,' by Ibn\r\n‘Arabsháh († 1450); and the _Nujúm al-Záhira_ ('Resplendent Stars') by\r\nAbu ’l-Maḥásin b. Taghríbirdí († 1469), which contains the annals of\r\nEgypt under the Moslems. The political and literary history of\r\nMuḥammadan Spain by Maqqarí of Tilimsán († 1632) was mentioned in the\r\nlast chapter.[842]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jalálu ’l-Dín al-Suyúṭí (1445-1505 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nIf we were asked to select a single figure who should exhibit as\r\ncompletely as possible in his own person the literary tendencies of the\r\nAlexandrian age of Arabic civilisation, our choice would assuredly fall\r\non Jalálu ’l-Dín al-Suyúṭí, who was born at Suyúṭ (Usyúṭ) in\r\nUpper Egypt in 1445 A.D. His family came originally from Persia, but,\r\nlike Dhahabí, Ibn Taghríbirdí, and many celebrated writers of this time,\r\nhe had, through his mother, an admixture of Turkish blood. At the age of\r\nfive years and seven months, when his father died, the precocious boy\r\nhad already reached the _Súratu ’l-Taḥrím_ (Súra of Forbidding),\r\nwhich is the sixty-sixth chapter of the Koran, and he knew the whole\r\nvolume by heart before he was eight years old. He prosecuted his studies\r\nunder the most renowned masters in every branch of Moslem learning, and\r\non finishing his education held one Professorship after another at Cairo\r\nuntil 1501, when he was deprived of his post in consequence of\r\nmalversation of the bursary monies in his charge. He died four years\r\nlater in the islet of Rawḍa on the Nile, whither he had retired under\r\nthe pretence of devoting the rest of his life to God. We possess the\r\ntitles of more than five hundred separate works which he composed. This\r\nnumber would be incredible but for the fact that many of them are brief\r\npamphlets displaying the author's curious erudition on all sorts of\r\nabstruse subjects--_e.g._, whether the Prophet wore trousers, whether\r\nhis turban had a point, and whether his parents are in Hell or Paradise.\r\nSuyúṭí's indefatigable pen travelled over an immense field of\r\nknowledge--Koran, Tradition, Law, Philosophy and History, Philology and\r\nRhetoric. Like some of the old Alexandrian scholars, he seems to have\r\ntaken pride in a reputation for polygraphy, and his enemies declared\r\nthat he made free with other men's books, which he used to alter\r\nslightly and then give out as his own. Suyúṭí, on his part, laid\r\nbefore the Shaykhu ’l-Islám a formal accusation of plagiarism against\r\nQasṭallání, an eminent contemporary divine. We are told that his\r\nvanity and arrogance involved him in frequent quarrels, and that he was\r\n'cut' by his learned brethren. Be this as it may, he saw what the public\r\nwanted. His compendious and readable handbooks were famed throughout the\r\nMoslem world, as he himself boasts, from India to Morocco, and did much\r\nto popularise the scientific culture of the day. It will be enough to\r\nmention here the _Itqán_ on Koranic exegesis; the _Tafsíru ’l-Jalálayn_,\r\nor 'Commentary on the Koran by the two Jaláls,' which was begun by\r\nJalálu ’l-Dín al-Maḥallí and finished by his namesake, Suyúṭí; the\r\n_Muzhir_ (_Mizhar_), a treatise on philology; the _Ḥusnu\r\n’l-Muḥáḍara_, a history of Old and New Cairo; and the _Ta’ríkhu\r\n’l-Khulafá_, or 'History of the Caliphs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other scholars of the period.]\r\n\r\nTo dwell longer on the literature of this period would only be to\r\nemphasise its scholastic and unoriginal character. A passing mention,\r\nhowever, is due to the encyclopædists Nuwayrí († 1332), author of the\r\n_Niháyatu ’l-Arab_, and Ibnu ’l-Wardí († 1349). Ṣafadí († 1363)\r\ncompiled a gigantic biographical dictionary, the _Wáfí bi ’l-Wafayát_,\r\nin twenty-six volumes, and the learned traditionist, Ibn Ḥajar of\r\nAscalon († 1449), has left a large number of writings, among which it\r\nwill be sufficient to name the _Iṣába fí tamyíz al-Ṣaḥába_, or\r\nLives of the Companions of the Prophet.[843] We shall conclude this part\r\nof our subject by enumerating a few celebrated works which may be\r\ndescribed in modern terms as standard text-books for the Schools and\r\nUniversities of Islam. Amidst the host of manuals of Theology and\r\nJurisprudence, with their endless array of abridgments, commentaries,\r\nand supercommentaries, possibly the best known to European students are\r\nthose by Abu ’l-Barakát al-Nasafí († 1310), ‘Aḍudu ’l-Dín al-Íjí (†\r\n1355), Sídí Khalíl al-Jundí († 1365), Taftázání († 1389), Sharíf\r\nal-Jurjání († 1413), and Muḥammad b. Yúsuf al-Sanúsí († 1486). For\r\nPhilology and Lexicography we have the _Alfiyya_, a versified grammar by\r\nIbn Málik of Jaen († 1273); the _Ájurrúmiyya_ on the rudiments of\r\ngrammar, an exceedingly popular compendium by Ṣanhájí († 1323); and\r\ntwo famous Arabic dictionaries, the _Lisánu ’l-‘Arab_ by Jamálu ’l-Dín\r\nIbn Mukarram († 1311), and the _Qámús_ by Fírúzábádí († 1414). Nor,\r\nalthough he was a Turk, should we leave unnoticed the great\r\nbibliographer Ḥájjí Khalífa († 1658), whose _Kashfu ’l-Ẓunún_\r\ncontains the titles, arranged alphabetically, of all the Arabic,\r\nPersian, and Turkish books of which the existence was known to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The 'Thousand and One Nights.']\r\n\r\nThe Mameluke period gave final shape to the _Alf Layla wa-Layla_, or\r\n'Thousand and One Nights,' a work which is far more popular in Europe\r\nthan the Koran or any other masterpiece of Arabic literature. The modern\r\ntitle, 'Arabian Nights,' tells only a part of the truth. Mas‘údí († 956\r\nA.D.) mentions an old Persian book, the _Hazár Afsána_ ('Thousand\r\nTales') which \"is generally called the Thousand and One Nights; it is\r\nthe story of the King and his Vizier, and of the Vizier's daughter and\r\nher slave-girl: Shírázád and Dínázád.\"[844] The author of the _Fihrist_,\r\nwriting in 988 A.D., begins his chapter \"concerning the Story-Tellers\r\nand the Fabulists and the names of the books which they composed\" with\r\nthe following passage (p. 304):--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Persian origin of the 'Thousand and One Nights.']\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: The _Hazár Afsán_.]\r\n\r\n  \"The first who composed fables and made books of them and put them\r\n  by in treasuries and sometimes introduced animals as speaking them\r\n  were the Ancient Persians. Afterwards the Parthian kings, who form\r\n  the third dynasty of the kings of Persia, showed the utmost zeal in\r\n  this matter. Then in the days of the Sásánian kings such books\r\n  became numerous and abundant, and the Arabs translated them into the\r\n  Arabic tongue, and they soon reached the hands of philologists and\r\n  rhetoricians, who corrected and embellished them and composed other\r\n  books in the same style. Now the first book ever made on this\r\n  subject was the Book of the Thousand Tales (_Hazár Afsán_), on the\r\n  following occasion: A certain king of Persia used to marry a woman\r\n  for one night and kill her the next morning. And he wedded a wise\r\n  and clever princess, called Shahrázád, who began to tell him stories\r\n  and brought the tale at daybreak to a point that induced the king to\r\n  spare her life and ask her on the second night to finish her tale.\r\n  So she continued until a thousand nights had passed, and she was\r\n  blessed with a son by him.... And the king had a stewardess\r\n  (_qahramána_) named Dínárzád, who was in league with the queen. It\r\n  is also said that this book was composed for Ḥumání, the daughter\r\n  of Bahman, and there are various traditions concerning it. The\r\n  truth, if God will, is that Alexander (the Great) was the first who\r\n  heard stories by night, and he had people to make him laugh and\r\n  divert him with tales; although he did not seek amusement therein,\r\n  but only to store and preserve them (in his memory). The kings who\r\n  came after him used the 'Thousand Tales' (_Hazár Afsán_) for this\r\n  purpose. It covers a space of one thousand nights, but contains less\r\n  than two hundred stories, because the telling of a single story\r\n  often takes several nights. I have seen the complete work more than\r\n  once, and it is indeed a vulgar, insipid book (_kitábun ghaththun\r\n  báridu ’l-hadíth_).[845]\r\n\r\n  Abu ‘Abdalláh Muḥammad b. ‘Abdús al-Jahshiyárí († 942-943 A.D.),\r\n  the author of the 'Book of Viziers,' began to compile a book in\r\n  which he selected one thousand stories of the Arabs, the Persians,\r\n  the Greeks, and other peoples, every piece being independent and\r\n  unconnected with the rest. He gathered the story-tellers round him\r\n  and took from them the best of what they knew and were able to tell,\r\n  and he chose out of the fable and story-books whatever pleased him.\r\n  He was a skilful craftsman, so he put together from this material\r\n  480 nights, each night an entire story of fifty pages, more or less,\r\n  but death surprised him before he completed the thousand tales as he\r\n  had intended.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different sources of the collection.]\r\n\r\nEvidently, then, the _Hazár Afsán_ was the kernel of the 'Arabian\r\nNights,' and it is probable that this Persian archetype included the\r\nmost finely imaginative tales in the existing collection, _e.g._, the\r\n'Fisherman and the Genie,' 'Camaralzamán and Budúr,' and the 'Enchanted\r\nHorse.' As time went on, the original stock received large additions\r\nwhich may be divided into two principal groups, both Semitic in\r\ncharacter: the one belonging to Baghdád and consisting mainly of\r\nhumorous anecdotes and love romances in which the famous Caliph 'Haroun\r\nAlraschid' frequently comes on the scene; the other having its centre in\r\nCairo, and marked by a roguish, ironical pleasantry as well as by the\r\nmechanic supernaturalism which is perfectly illustrated in 'Aladdin and\r\nthe Wonderful Lamp.' But, apart from these three sources, the 'Arabian\r\nNights' has in the course of centuries accumulated and absorbed an\r\nimmense number of Oriental folk-tales of every description, equally\r\nvarious in origin and style. The oldest translation by Galland (Paris,\r\n1704-1717) is a charming paraphrase, which in some respects is more true\r\nto the spirit of the original than are the scholarly renderings of Lane\r\nand Burton.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The 'Romance of ‘Antar.']\r\n\r\nThe 'Romance of ‘Antar' (_Síratu ‘Antar_) is traditionally ascribed to\r\nthe great philologist, Aṣma‘í,[846] who flourished in the reign of\r\nHárún al-Rashíd, but this must be considered as an invention of the\r\nprofessional reciters who sit in front of Oriental cafés and entertain\r\nthe public with their lively declamations.[847] According to\r\nBrockelmann, the work in its present form apparently dates from the time\r\nof the Crusades.[848] Its hero is the celebrated heathen poet and\r\nwarrior, ‘Antara b. Shaddád, of whom we have already given an account as\r\nauthor of one of the seven _Mu‘allaqát_. Though the Romance exhibits all\r\nthe anachronisms and exaggerations of popular legend, it does\r\nnevertheless portray the unchanging features of Bedouin life with\r\nadmirable fidelity and picturesqueness. Von Hammer, whose notice in the\r\n_Mines de l'Orient_ (1802) was the means of introducing the _Síratu\r\n‘Antar_ to European readers, justly remarks that it cannot be translated\r\nin full owing to its portentous length. It exists in two recensions\r\ncalled respectively the Arabian (_Ḥijáziyya_) and the Syrian\r\n(_Shámiyya_), the latter being very much curtailed.[849]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orthodoxy and mysticism.]\r\n\r\nWhile the decadent state of Arabic literature during all these centuries\r\nwas immediately caused by unfavourable social and political conditions,\r\nthe real source of the malady lay deeper, and must, I think, be referred\r\nto the spiritual paralysis which had long been creeping over Islam and\r\nwhich manifested itself by the complete victory of the Ash‘arites or\r\nScholastic Theologians about 1200 A.D. Philosophy and Rationalism were\r\nhenceforth as good as dead. Two parties remained in possession of the\r\nfield--the orthodox and the mystics. The former were naturally\r\nintolerant of anything approaching to free-thought, and in their\r\nprinciple of _ijmá‘_, _i.e._, the consensus of public opinion (which was\r\npractically controlled by themselves), they found a potent weapon\r\nagainst heresy. How ruthlessly they sometimes used it we may see from\r\nthe following passage in the _Yawáqít_ of Sha‘rání. After giving\r\ninstances of the persecution to which the Ṣúfís of old--Báyazíd, Dhú\r\n’l-Nún, and others--were subjected by their implacable enemies, the\r\n_‘Ulamá_, he goes on to speak of what had happened more recently[850]:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Persecution of heretics.]\r\n\r\n  \"They brought the Imám Abú Bakr al-Nábulusí, notwithstanding his\r\n  merit and profound learning and rectitude in religion, from the\r\n  Maghrib to Egypt and testified that he was a heretic (_zindíq_). The\r\n  Sultan gave orders that he should be suspended by his feet and\r\n  flayed alive. While the sentence was being carried out, he began to\r\n  recite the Koran with such an attentive and humble demeanour that he\r\n  moved the hearts of the people, and they were near making a riot.\r\n  And likewise they caused Nasímí to be flayed at Aleppo.[851] When he\r\n  silenced them by his arguments, they devised a plan for his\r\n  destruction, thus: They wrote the _Súratu ’l-Ikhláṣ_[852] on a\r\n  piece of paper and bribed a cobbler of shoes, saying to him, 'It\r\n  contains only love and pleasantness, so place it inside the sole of\r\n  the shoe.' Then they took that shoe and sent it from a far distance\r\n  as a gift to the Shaykh (Nasímí), who put it on, for he knew not.\r\n  His adversaries went to the governor of Aleppo and said: 'We have\r\n  sure information that Nasímí has written, _Say, God is One_, and has\r\n  placed the writing in the sole of his shoe. If you do not believe\r\n  us, send for him and see!' The governor did as they wished. On the\r\n  production of the paper, the Shaykh resigned himself to the will of\r\n  God and made no answer to the charge, knowing well that he would be\r\n  killed on that pretext. I was told by one who studied under his\r\n  disciples that all the time when he was being flayed Nasímí was\r\n  reciting _muwashshaḥs_ in praise of the Unity of God, until he\r\n  composed five hundred verses, and that he was looking at his\r\n  executioners and smiling. And likewise they brought Shaykh Abu\r\n  ’l-Ḥasan al-Shádhilí[853] from the West to Egypt and bore\r\n  witness that he was a heretic, but God delivered him from their\r\n  plots. And they accused Shaykh ‘Izzu ’l-Dín b. ‘Abd al-Salám[854] of\r\n  infidelity and sat in judgment over him on account of some\r\n  expressions in his _‘Aqída_ (Articles of Faith) and urged the Sultan\r\n  to punish him; afterwards, however, he was restored to favour. They\r\n  denounced Shaykh Táju ’l-Dín al-Subkí[855] on the same charge,\r\n  asserting that he held it lawful to drink wine and that he wore at\r\n  night the badge (_ghiyár_) of the unbelievers and the zone\r\n  (_zunnár_)[856]; and they brought him, manacled and in chains, from\r\n  Syria to Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture is too highly coloured. It must be admitted for the credit\r\nof the _‘Ulamá_, that they seldom resorted to violence. Islam was\r\nhappily spared the horrors of an organised Inquisition. On the other\r\nhand, their authority was now so firmly established that all progress\r\ntowards moral and intellectual liberty had apparently ceased, or at any\r\nrate only betrayed itself in spasmodic outbursts. Ṣúfiism in some\r\ndegree represented such a movement, but the mystics shared the triumph\r\nof Scholasticism and contributed to the reaction which ensued. No longer\r\nan oppressed minority struggling for toleration, they found themselves\r\nside by side with reverend doctors on a platform broad enough to\r\naccommodate all parties, and they saw their own popular heroes turned\r\ninto Saints of the orthodox Church. The compromise did not always work\r\nsmoothly--in fact, there was continual friction--but on the whole it\r\nseems to have borne the strain wonderfully well. If pious souls were\r\nshocked by the lawlessness of the Dervishes, and if bigots would fain\r\nhave burned the books of Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí and Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ, the\r\ndivines in general showed a disposition to suspend judgment in matters\r\ntouching holy men and to regard them as standing above human criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs typical representatives of the religious life of this period we may\r\ntake two men belonging to widely opposite camps--Taqiyyu ’l-Dín Ibn\r\nTaymiyya and ‘Abdu ’l-Wahháb al-Sha‘rání.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibn Taymiyya (1263-1328 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nIbn Taymiyya was born at Ḥarrán in 1263 A.D. A few years later his\r\nfather, fleeing before the Mongols, brought him to Damascus, where in\r\ndue course he received an excellent education. It is said that he never\r\nforgot anything which he had once learned, and his knowledge of theology\r\nand law was so extensive as almost to justify the saying, \"A tradition\r\nthat Ibn Taymiyya does not recognise is no tradition.\" Himself a\r\nḤanbalite of the deepest dye--holding, in other words, that the Koran\r\nmust be interpreted according to its letter and not by the light of\r\nreason--he devoted his life with rare courage to the work of religious\r\nreform. His aim, in short, was to restore the primitive monotheism\r\ntaught by the Prophet and to purge Islam of the heresies and corruptions\r\nwhich threatened to destroy it. One may imagine what a hornet's nest he\r\nwas attacking. Mystics, philosophers, and scholastic theologians, all\r\nfell alike under the lash of his denunciation. Bowing to no authority,\r\nbut drawing his arguments from the traditions and practice of the early\r\nChurch, he expressed his convictions in the most forcible terms, without\r\nregard to consequences. Although several times thrown into prison, he\r\ncould not be muzzled for long. The climax was reached when he lifted up\r\nhis voice against the superstitions of the popular faith--saint-worship,\r\npilgrimage to holy shrines, vows, offerings, and invocations. These\r\nthings, which the zealous puritan condemned as sheer idolatry, were part\r\nof a venerable cult that was hallowed by ancient custom, and had\r\nengrafted itself in luxuriant overgrowth upon Islam. The mass of Moslems\r\nbelieved, and still believe implicitly in the saints, accept their\r\nmiracles, adore their relics, visit their tombs, and pray for their\r\nintercession. Ibn Taymiyya even declared that it was wrong to implore\r\nthe aid of the Prophet or to make a pilgrimage to his sepulchre. It was\r\na vain protest. He ended his days in captivity at Damascus. The vast\r\ncrowds who attended his funeral--we are told that there were present\r\n200,000 men and 15,000 women--bore witness to the profound respect which\r\nwas universally felt for the intrepid reformer. Oddly enough, he was\r\nburied in the Cemetery of the Ṣúfís, whose doctrines he had so\r\nbitterly opposed, and the multitude revered his memory--as a saint! The\r\nprinciples which inspired Ibn Taymiyya did not fall to the ground,\r\nalthough their immediate effect was confined to a very small circle. We\r\nshall see them reappearing victoriously in the Wahhábite movement of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sha‘rání († 1565 A.D.).]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the brilliant effort of Ghazálí to harmonise dogmatic\r\ntheology with mysticism, it soon became clear that the two parties were\r\nin essence irreconcilable. The orthodox clergy who held fast by the\r\nauthority of the Koran and the Traditions saw a grave danger to\r\nthemselves in the esoteric revelation which the mystics claimed to\r\npossess; while the latter, though externally conforming to the law of\r\nIslam, looked down with contempt on the idea that true knowledge of God\r\ncould be derived from theology, or from any source except the inner\r\nlight of heavenly inspiration. Hence the antithesis of _faqíh_\r\n(theologian) and _faqír_ (dervish), the one class forming a powerful\r\nofficial hierarchy in close alliance with the Government, whereas the\r\nṢúfís found their chief support among the people at large, and\r\nespecially among the poor. We need not dwell further on the natural\r\nantagonism which has always existed between these rival corporations,\r\nand which is a marked feature in the modern history of Islam. It will be\r\nmore instructive to spend a few moments with the last great\r\nMuḥammadan theosophist, ‘Abdu ’l-Wahháb al-Sha‘rání, a man who, with\r\nall his weaknesses, was an original thinker, and exerted an influence\r\nstrongly felt to this day, as is shown by the steady demand for his\r\nbooks. He was born about the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\nConcerning his outward life we have little information beyond the facts\r\nthat he was a weaver by trade and resided in Cairo. At this time Egypt\r\nwas a province of the Ottoman Empire. Sha‘rání contrasts the miserable\r\nlot of the peasantry under the new _régime_ with their comparative\r\nprosperity under the Mamelukes. So terrible were the exactions of the\r\ntax-gatherers that the fellah was forced to sell the whole produce of\r\nhis land, and sometimes even the ox which ploughed it, in order to save\r\nhimself and his family from imprisonment; and every lucrative business\r\nwas crushed by confiscation. It is not to be supposed, however, that\r\nSha‘rání gave serious attention to such sublunary matters. He lived in a\r\nworld of visions and wonderful experiences. He conversed with angels and\r\nprophets, like his more famous predecessor, Muḥyi ’l-Dín Ibnu\r\n’l-‘Arabí, whose _Meccan Revelations_ he studied and epitomised. His\r\nautobiography entitled _Laṭá’ifu ’l-Minan_ displays the hierophant in\r\nfull dress. It is a record of the singular spiritual gifts and virtues\r\nwith which he was endowed, and would rank as a masterpiece of shameless\r\nself-laudation, did not the author repeatedly assure us that all his\r\nextraordinary qualities are Divine blessings and are gratefully set\r\nforth by their recipient _ad majorem Dei gloriam_. We should be treating\r\nSha‘rání very unfairly if we judged him by this work alone. The arrogant\r\nmiracle-monger was one of the most learned men of his day, and could\r\nbeat the scholastic theologians with their own weapons. Indeed, he\r\nregarded theology (_fiqh_) as the first step towards Ṣúfiism, and\r\nendeavoured to show that in reality they are different aspects of the\r\nsame science. He also sought to harmonise the four great schools of law,\r\nwhose disagreement was consecrated by the well-known saying ascribed to\r\nthe Prophet: \"The variance of my people is an act of Divine mercy\"\r\n(_ikhtiláfu ummatí raḥmatun_). Like the Arabian Ṣúfís generally,\r\nSha‘rání kept his mysticism within narrow bounds, and declared himself\r\nan adherent of the moderate section which follows Junayd of Baghdád (†\r\n909-910 A.D.). For all his extravagant pretensions and childish belief\r\nin the supernatural, he never lost touch with the Muḥammadan Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century Ibn Taymiyya had tried to eradicate the abuses\r\nwhich obscured the simple creed of Islam. He failed, but his work was\r\ncarried on by others and was crowned, after a long interval, by the\r\nWahhábite Reformation.[857]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Muḥammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahháb and his successors.]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahháb,[858] from whom its name is derived, was\r\nborn about 1720 A.D. in Najd, the Highlands of Arabia. In his youth he\r\nvisited the principal cities of the East, \"as is much the practice with\r\nhis countrymen even now,\"[859] and what he observed in the course of his\r\ntravels convinced him that Islam was thoroughly corrupt. Fired by the\r\nexample of Ibn Taymiyya, whose writings he copied with his own\r\nhand,[860] Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahháb determined to re-establish the pure\r\nreligion of Muḥammad in its primitive form. Accordingly he returned\r\nhome and retired with his family to Ḑira‘iyya at the time when\r\nMuḥammad b. Sa‘úd was the chief personage of the town. This man\r\nbecame his first convert and soon after married his daughter. But it was\r\nnot until the end of the eighteenth century that the Wahhábís, under\r\n‘Abdu ’l-‘Azíz, son of Muḥammad b. Sa‘úd, gained their first great\r\nsuccesses. In 1801 they sacked Imám-Ḥusayn,[861] a town in the\r\nvicinity of Baghdád, massacred five thousand persons, and destroyed the\r\ncupola of Ḥusayn's tomb; the veneration paid by all Shí‘ites to that\r\nshrine being, as Burckhardt says, a sufficient cause to attract the\r\nWahhábí fury against it. Two years later they made themselves masters of\r\nthe whole Ḥijáz, including Mecca and Medína. On the death of ‘Abdu\r\n’l-‘Azíz, who was assassinated in the same year, his eldest son, Sa‘úd,\r\ncontinued the work of conquest and brought the greater part of Arabia\r\nunder Wahhábite rule. At last, in 1811, Turkey despatched a fleet and\r\narmy to recover the Holy Cities. This task was accomplished by\r\nMuḥammad ‘Alí, the Pasha of Egypt (1812-13), and after five years'\r\nhard fighting the war ended in favour of the Turks, who in 1818\r\ninflicted a severe defeat on the Wahhábís and took their capital,\r\nḐira‘iyya, by storm. The sect, however, still maintains its power in\r\nCentral Arabia, and in recent times has acquired political importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wahhábite Reformation.]\r\n\r\nThe Wahhábís were regarded by the Turks as infidels and authors of a new\r\nreligion. It was natural that they should appear in this light, for they\r\ninterrupted the pilgrim-caravans, demolished the domes and ornamented\r\ntombs of the most venerable Saints (not excepting that of the Prophet\r\nhimself), and broke to pieces the Black Stone in the Ka‘ba. All this\r\nthey did not as innovators, but as reformers. They resembled the\r\nCarmathians only in their acts. Burckhardt says very truly: \"Not a\r\nsingle new precept was to be found in the Wahaby code. Abd el Waháb took\r\nas his sole guide the Koran and the Sunne (or the laws formed upon the\r\ntraditions of Mohammed); and the only difference between his sect and\r\nthe orthodox Turks, however improperly so termed, is, that the Wahabys\r\nrigidly follow the same laws which the others neglect, or have ceased\r\naltogether to observe.\"[862] \"The Wahhábites,\" says Dozy, \"attacked the\r\nidolatrous worship of Mahomet; although he was in their eyes a Prophet\r\nsent to declare the will of God, he was no less a man like others, and\r\nhis mortal shell, far from having mounted to heaven, rested in the tomb\r\nat Medína. Saint-worship they combated just as strongly. They proclaimed\r\nthat all men are equal before God; that even the most virtuous and\r\ndevout cannot intercede with Him; and that, consequently, it is a sin to\r\ninvoke the Saints and to adore their relics.\"[863] In the same puritan\r\nspirit they forbade the smoking of tobacco, the wearing of gaudy robes,\r\nand praying over the rosary. \"It has been stated that they likewise\r\nprohibited the drinking of coffee; this, however, is not the fact: they\r\nhave always used it to an immoderate degree.\"[864]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sanúsís in Africa.]\r\n\r\nThe Wahhábite movement has been compared with the Protestant Reformation\r\nin Europe; but while the latter was followed by the English and French\r\nRevolutions, the former has not yet produced any great political\r\nresults. It has borne fruit in a general religious revival throughout\r\nthe world of Islam and particularly in the mysterious Sanúsiyya\r\nBrotherhood, whose influence is supreme in Tripoli, the Sahara, and the\r\nwhole North African Hinterland, and whose members are reckoned by\r\nmillions. Muḥammad b. ‘Alí b. Sanúsí, the founder of this vast and\r\nformidable organisation, was born at Algiers in 1791, lived for many\r\nyears at Mecca, and died at Jaghbúb in the Libyan desert, midway between\r\nEgypt and Tripoli, in 1859. Concerning the real aims of the Sanúsís I\r\nmust refer the reader to an interesting paper by the Rev. E. Sell\r\n(_Essays on Islam_, p. 127 sqq.). There is no doubt that they are\r\nutterly opposed to all Western and modern civilisation, and seek to\r\nregenerate Islam by establishing an independent theocratic State on the\r\nmodel of that which the Prophet and his successors called into being at\r\nMedína in the seventh century after Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Islam and modern civilisation.]\r\n\r\nSince Napoleon showed the way by his expedition to Egypt in 1798, the\r\nMoslems in that country, as likewise in Syria and North Africa, have\r\ncome more and more under European influence.[865] The above-mentioned\r\nMuḥammad ‘Alí, who founded the Khedivial dynasty, and his successors\r\nwere fully alive to the practical benefits which might be obtained from\r\nthe superior culture of the West, and although their policy in this\r\nrespect was marked by greater zeal than discretion, they did not exert\r\nthemselves altogether in vain. The introduction of the printing-press in\r\n1821 was an epoch-making measure. If, on the one hand, the publication\r\nof many classical works, which had well-nigh fallen into oblivion,\r\nrekindled the enthusiasm of the Arabs for their national literature, the\r\ncause of progress--I use the word without prejudice--has been furthered\r\nby the numerous political, literary, and scientific journals which are\r\nnow regularly issued in every country where Arabic is spoken.[866]\r\nBesides these ephemeral sheets, books of all sorts, old and new, have\r\nbeen multiplied by the native and European presses of Cairo, Búláq, and\r\nBeyrout. The science and culture of Europe have been rendered accessible\r\nin translations and adaptations of which the complete list would form a\r\nvolume in itself. Thus, an Arab may read in his own language the\r\ntragedies of Racine, the comedies of Molière,[867] the fables of La\r\nFontaine, 'Paul and Virginia,' the 'Talisman,' 'Monte Cristo' (not to\r\nmention scores of minor romances), and even the Iliad of Homer.[868]\r\nParallel to this imitative activity, we see a vigorous and growing\r\nmovement away from the literary models of the past. \"Neo-Arabic\r\nliterature is only to a limited extent the heir of the old 'classical'\r\nArabic literature, and even shows a tendency to repudiate its\r\ninheritance entirely. Its leaders are for the most part men who have\r\ndrunk from other springs and look at the world with different eyes. Yet\r\nthe past still plays a part in their intellectual background, and there\r\nis a section amongst them upon whom that past retains a hold scarcely\r\nshaken by newer influences. For many decades the partisans of the 'old'\r\nand the 'new' have engaged in a struggle for the soul of the Arabic\r\nworld, a struggle in which the victory of one side over the other is\r\neven yet not assured. The protagonists are (to classify them roughly for\r\npractical purposes) the European-educated classes of Egyptians and\r\nSyrians on the one hand, and those in Egypt and the less advanced Arabic\r\nlands whose education has followed traditional lines on the other.\r\nWhatever the ultimate result may be, there can be no question that the\r\nconflict has torn the Arabic world from its ancient moorings, and that\r\nthe contemporary literature of Egypt and Syria breathes in its more\r\nrecent developments a spirit foreign to the old traditions.\"[869]\r\n\r\nHitherto Western culture has only touched the surface of Islam. Whether\r\nit will eventually strike deeper and penetrate the inmost barriers of\r\nthat scholastic discipline and literary tradition which are so firmly\r\nrooted in the affections of the Moslem peoples, or whether it will\r\nalways remain an exotic and highly-prized accomplishment of the\r\nenlightened and emancipated few, but an object of scorn and detestation\r\nto Muḥammadans in general--these are questions that may not be fully\r\nsolved for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Past affords an ample and splendid field of study.\r\n\r\n  \"_Man lam ya‘i ’l-ta’ríkha fí ṣadrihí\r\n  Lam yadri ḥulwa ’l-‘ayshi min murrihi\r\n  Wa-man wa‘á akhbára man qad maḍá\r\n  Aḍáfa a‘máran ilá ‘umrihí._\"\r\n\r\n  \"He in whose heart no History is enscrolled\r\n  Cannot discern in life's alloy the gold.\r\n  But he that keeps the records of the Dead\r\n  Adds to his life new lives a hundredfold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] H.

His great dictionary, the\r\n_Shamsu ’l-‘Ulúm_, is a valuable aid to those engaged in the study of\r\nSouth Arabian antiquities. It has been used by D. H. Müller to fix the\r\ncorrect spelling of proper names which occur in the Ḥimyarite Ode\r\n(_Z.D.M.G._, vol. 29, p. 620 sqq.; _Südarabische Studien_, p. 143 sqq.).\r\n\r\n[43] _Fihrist_, p. 89, l. 26.\r\n\r\n[44] _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_, ed. by Barbier de Meynard, vol. iv, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[45] Von Kremer, _Die Südarabische Sage_, p. 56. Possibly, as he\r\nsuggests (p. 115), the story may be a symbolical expression of the fact\r\nthat the Sabæans were divided into two great tribes, Ḥimyar and\r\nKahlán, the former of which held the chief power.\r\n\r\n[46] _Cf._ Koran xxxiv, 14 sqq. The existing ruins have been described\r\nby Arnaud in the _Journal Asiatique_, 7th series, vol. 3 (1874), p. 3\r\nsqq.\r\n\r\n[47] I follow Mas‘údí, _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_ (ed. by Barbier de Meynard),\r\nvol. iii, p. 378 sqq., and Nuwayrí in Reiske's _Primæ lineæ Historiæ\r\nRerum Arabicarum_, p. 166 sqq.\r\n\r\n[48] The story of the migration from Ma’rib, as related below, may have\r\nsome historical basis, but the Dam itself was not finally destroyed\r\nuntil long afterwards. Inscriptions carved on the existing ruins show\r\nthat it was more or less in working order down to the middle of the\r\nsixth century A.D. The first recorded flood took place in 447-450, and\r\non another occasion (in 539-542) the Dam was partially reconstructed by\r\nAbraha, the Abyssinian viceroy of Yemen. See E. Glaser, _Zwei\r\nInschriften über den Dammbruch von Mârib_ (_Mitteilungen der\r\nVorderastatischen Gesellschaft_, 1897, 6).\r\n\r\n[49] He is said to have gained this sobriquet from his custom of tearing\r\nto pieces (_mazaqa_) every night the robe which he had worn during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[50] Freytag, _Arabum Proverbia_, vol. i, p. 497.\r\n\r\n[51] Hamdání, _Iklíl_, bk. viii, edited by D. H. Müller in _S.B.W.A._\r\n(Vienna, 1881), vol. 97, p. 1037. The verses are quoted with some\r\ntextual differences by Yáqút, _Mu‘jam al-Buldán_, ed. by Wüstenfeld,\r\nvol. iv, 387, and Ibn Hishám, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[52] The following inscription is engraved on one of the stone cylinders\r\ndescribed by Arnaud. \"Yatha‘amar Bayyin, son of Samah‘alí Yanúf, Prince\r\nof Saba, caused the mountain Balaq to be pierced and erected the\r\nflood-gates (called) Raḥab for convenience of irrigation.\" I\r\ntranslate after D. H. Müller, _loc. laud._, p. 965.\r\n\r\n[53] The words _Ḥimyar_ and _Tubba‘_ do not occur at all in the older\r\ninscriptions, and very seldom even in those of a more recent date.\r\n\r\n[54] See Koran, xviii, 82-98.\r\n\r\n[55] Dhu ’l-Qarnayn is described as \"the measurer of the earth\"\r\n(_Massáḥu ’l-arḍ_) by Hamdání, _Jazíratu ’l-‘Arab_, p. 46, l. 10.\r\nIf I may step for a moment outside the province of literary history to\r\ndiscuss the mythology of these verses, it seems to me more than probable\r\nthat Dhu ’l-Qarnayn is a personification of the Sabæan divinity ‘Athtar,\r\nwho represents \"sweet Hesper-Phosphor, double name\" (see D. H. Müller in\r\n_S.B.W.A._, vol. 97, p. 973 seq.). The Minæan inscriptions have \"‘Athtar\r\nof the setting and ‘Athtar of the rising\" (_ibid._, p. 1033). Moreover,\r\nin the older inscriptions ‘Athtar and Almaqa are always mentioned\r\ntogether; and Almaqa, which according to Hamdání is the name of Venus\r\n(_al-Zuhara_), was identified by Arabian archæologists with Bilqís. For\r\n_qarn_ in the sense of 'ray' or 'beam' see Goldziher, _Abhand. zur Arab.\r\nPhilologie_, Part I, p. 114. I think there is little doubt that Dhu\r\n’l-Qarnayn and Bilqís may be added to the examples (_ibid._, p. 111\r\nsqq.) of that peculiar conversion by which many heathen deities were\r\nenabled to maintain themselves under various disguises within the pale\r\nof Islam.\r\n\r\n[56] The Arabic text will be found in Von Kremer's _Altarabische\r\nGedichte ueber die Volkssage von Jemen_, p. 15 (No. viii, l. 6 sqq.).\r\nḤassán b. Thábit, the author of these lines, was contemporary with\r\nMuḥammad, to whose cause he devoted what poetical talent he possessed.\r\nIn the verses immediately preceding those translated above he claims to\r\nbe a descendant of Qaḥṭán.\r\n\r\n[57] Von Kremer, _Die Südarabische Sage_, p. vii of the Introduction.\r\n\r\n[58] A prose translation is given by Von Kremer, _ibid._, p. 78 sqq. The\r\nArabic text which he published afterwards in _Altarabische Gedichte\r\nueber die Volkssage von Jemen_, p. 18 sqq., is corrupt in some places\r\nand incorrect in others. I have followed Von Kremer's interpretation\r\nexcept when it seemed to me to be manifestly untenable. The reader will\r\nhave no difficulty in believing that this poem was meant to be recited\r\nby a wandering minstrel to the hearers that gathered round him at\r\nnightfall. It may well be the composition of one of those professional\r\nstory-tellers who flourished in the first century after the Flight, such\r\nas ‘Abíd b. Sharya (see p. 13 _supra_), or Yazíd b. Rabí‘a b. Mufarrigh\r\n(† 688 A.D.), who is said to have invented the poems and romances of the\r\nḤimyarite kings (_Aghání_, xvii, 52).\r\n\r\n[59] Instead of Hinwam the original has Hayyúm, for which Von Kremer\r\nreads Ahnúm. But see Hamdání, _Jazíralu ’l-‘Arab_, p. 193, last line and\r\nfol.\r\n\r\n[60] I read _al-jahdi_ for _al-jahli_.\r\n\r\n[61] I omit the following verses, which tell how an old woman of Medína\r\ncame to King As‘ad, imploring him to avenge her wrongs, and how he\r\ngathered an innumerable army, routed his enemies, and returned to\r\nẒafár in triumph.\r\n\r\n[62] Ibn Hishám, p. 13, l. 14 sqq.\r\n\r\n[63] Ibn Hishám, p. 15, l. 1 sqq.\r\n\r\n[64] _Ibid._, p. 17, l. 2 sqq.\r\n\r\n[65] Arabic text in Von Kremer's _Altarabische Gedichte ueber die\r\nVolkssage von Jemen_, p. 20 seq.; prose translation by the same author\r\nin _Die Südarabische Sage_, p. 84 sqq.\r\n\r\n[66] The second half of this verse is corrupt. Von Kremer translates (in\r\nhis notes to the Arabic text, p. 26): \"And bury with me the camel\r\nstallions (_al-khílán_) and the slaves (_al-ruqqán_).\" Apart, however,\r\nfrom the fact that _ruqqán_ (plural of _raqíq_) is not mentioned by the\r\nlexicographers, it seems highly improbable that the king would have\r\ncommanded such a barbarity. I therefore take _khílán_ (plural of _khál_)\r\nin the meaning of 'soft stuffs of Yemen,' and read _zuqqán_ (plural of\r\n_ziqq_).\r\n\r\n[67] Ghaymán or Miqláb, a castle near Ṣan‘á, in which the\r\nḤimyarite kings were buried.\r\n\r\n[68] The text and translation of this section of the _Iklíl_ have been\r\npublished by D.

The incidental references to contemporary events in\r\nSyriac and Byzantine writers, who often describe what they saw with\r\ntheir own eyes, are extremely valuable as a means of fixing the\r\nchronology, which Arabian historians can only supply by conjecture,\r\nowing to the want of a definite era during the Pre-islamic period.\r\nMuḥammadan general histories usually contain sections, more or less\r\nmythical in character, \"On the Kings of Ḥíra and Ghassán.\" Attention\r\nmay be called in particular to the account derived from Hishám b.\r\nMuḥammad al-Kalbí, which is preserved by Ṭabarí and has been\r\ntranslated with a masterly commentary by Nöldeke in his _Geschichte der\r\nPerser und Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden_. Hishám had access to the\r\narchives kept in the churches of Ḥíra, and claims to have extracted\r\ntherefrom many genealogical and chronological details relating to the\r\nLakhmite dynasty (Ṭabarí, i, 770, 7).\r\n\r\n[84] Ḥíra is the Syriac _ḥértá_ (sacred enclosure, monastery),\r\nwhich name was applied to the originally mobile camp of the Persian\r\nArabs and retained as the designation of the garrison town.\r\n\r\n[85] Sadír was a castle in the vicinity of Ḥíra.\r\n\r\n[86] Ṭabarí, i, 853, 20 sqq.\r\n\r\n[87] Bahrám was educated at Ḥíra under Nu‘mán and Mundhir. The\r\nPersian grandees complained that he had the manners and appearance of\r\nthe Arabs among whom he had grown up (Ṭabarí, i, 858, 7).\r\n\r\n[88] Má’ al-samá (_i.e._, Water of the sky) is said to have been the\r\nsobriquet of Mundhir's mother, whose proper name was Máriya or Máwiyya.\r\n\r\n[89] For an account of Mazdak and his doctrines the reader may consult\r\nNöldeke's translation of Ṭabarí, pp. 140-144, 154, and 455-467, and\r\nProfessor Browne's _Literary History of Persia_, vol. i, pp. 168-172.\r\n\r\n[90] Mundhir slaughtered in cold blood some forty or fifty members of\r\nthe royal house of Kinda who had fallen into his hands. Ḥárith\r\nhimself was defeated and slain by Mundhir in 529. Thereafter the power\r\nof Kinda sank, and they were gradually forced back to their original\r\nsettlements in Ḥaḍramawt.\r\n\r\n[91] On another occasion he sacrificed four hundred Christian nuns to\r\nthe same goddess.\r\n\r\n[92] See p. 50 _infra_.\r\n\r\n[93] _Aghání_, xix, 86, l. 16 sqq.\r\n\r\n[94] _Aghání_, xix, 87, l. 18 sqq.\r\n\r\n[95] Hind was a princess of Kinda (daughter of the Ḥárith b. ‘Amr\r\nmentioned above), whom Mundhir probably captured in one of his marauding\r\nexpeditions. She was a Christian, and founded a monastery at Ḥíra.\r\nSee Nöldeke's translation of Ṭabarí, p. 172, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[96] _Aghání_, xxi, 194, l. 22.\r\n\r\n[97] Zayd was actually Regent of Ḥíra after the death of Qábús, and\r\npaved the way for Mundhir IV, whose violence had made him detested by\r\nthe people (Nöldeke's translation of Ṭabarí, p. 346, n. 1).\r\n\r\n[98] The Arabs called the Byzantine emperor '_Qayṣar_,' _i.e._,\r\nCæsar, and the Persian emperor '_Kisrá_,' _i.e._, Chosroes.\r\n\r\n[99] My friend and colleague, Professor A. A. Bevan, writes to me that\r\n\"the story of ‘Adí's marriage with the king's daughter is based partly\r\non a verse in which the poet speaks of himself as connected by marriage\r\nwith the royal house (_Aghání_, ii, 26, l. 5), and partly on another\r\nverse in which he mentions 'the home of Hind' (_ibid._, ii, 32, l. 1).\r\nBut this Hind was evidently a Bedouin woman, not the king's daughter.\"\r\n\r\n[100] _Aghání_, ii, 22, l. 3 sqq.\r\n\r\n[101] When Hurmuz summoned the sons of Mundhir to Ctesiphon that he\r\nmight choose a king from among them, ‘Adí said to each one privately,\r\n\"If the Chosroes demands whether you can keep the Arabs in order, reply,\r\n'All except Nu‘mán.'\" To Nu‘mán, however, he said: \"The Chosroes will\r\nask, 'Can you manage your brothers?' Say to him: 'If I am not strong\r\nenough for them, I am still less able to control other folk!'\" Hurmuz\r\nwas satisfied with this answer and conferred the crown upon Nu‘mán.\r\n\r\n[102] A full account of these matters is given by Ṭabarí, i,\r\n1016-1024 = Nöldeke's translation, pp. 314-324.\r\n\r\n[103] A similar description occurs in Freytag's _Arabum Proverbia_, vol.\r\nii. p. 589 sqq.\r\n\r\n[104] Ṭabarí, i, 1024-1029 = Nöldeke's translation, pp. 324-331.

See\r\n_The Third Part of the Ecclesiastical History of John, Bishop of\r\nEphesus_, translated by R. Payne Smith, p. 168.\r\n\r\n[111] Iyás b. Qabíṣa succeeded Nu‘mán III as ruler of Ḥíra\r\n(602-611 A.D.). He belonged to the tribe of Ṭayyi’. See Rothstein,\r\n_Laẖmiden_, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[112] I read _yatafaḍḍalu_ for _yanfaṣilu_. The arrangement\r\nwhich the former word denotes is explained in Lane's Dictionary as \"the\r\nthrowing a portion of one's garment over his left shoulder, and drawing\r\nits extremity under his right arm, and tying the two extremities\r\ntogether in a knot upon his bosom.\"\r\n\r\n[113] The _fanak_ is properly a kind of white stoat or weasel found in\r\nAbyssinia and northern Africa, but the name is also applied by\r\nMuḥammadans to other furs.\r\n\r\n[114] _Aghání_, xvi, 15, ll. 22-30. So far as it purports to proceed\r\nfrom Ḥassán, the passage is apocryphal, but this does not seriously\r\naffect its value as evidence, if we consider that it is probably\r\ncompiled from the poet's _díwán_ in which the Ghassánids are often\r\nspoken of. The particular reference to Jabala b. al-Ayham is a mistake.\r\nḤassán's acquaintance with the Ghassánids belongs to the pagan period\r\nof his life, and he is known to have accepted Islam many years before\r\nJabala began to reign.\r\n\r\n[115] Nábigha, ed. by Derenbourg, p. 78; Nöldeke's _Delectus_, p. 96.\r\nThe whole poem has been translated by Sir Charles Lyall in his _Ancient\r\nArabian Poetry_, p. 95 sqq.\r\n\r\n[116] Thorbecke, _‘Antarah, ein vorislamischer Dichter_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[117] The following narrative is an abridgment of the history of the War\r\nof Basús as related in Tibrízí's commentary on the _Ḥamása_ (ed. by\r\nFreytag), pp. 420-423 and 251-255. _Cf._ Nöldeke's _Delectus_, p. 39 sqq.\r\n\r\n[118] See p. 5 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[119] Wá’il is the common ancestor of Bakr and Taghlib.

In a specimen cited at p. 81 we find the words _witla yā\r\ndlêwēna_--_i.e._, \"Rise, O bucket!\" several times repeated.\r\n\r\n[142] Goldziher, _Ueber die Vorgeschichte der Higâ-Poesie_ in his\r\n_Abhand. zur Arab. Philologie_, Part I (Leyden, 1896), p. 26.\r\n\r\n[143] _Cf._ the story of Balak and Balaam, with Goldziher's remarks\r\nthereon, _ibid._, p. 42 seq.\r\n\r\n[144] _Ibid._, p. 46 seq.\r\n\r\n[145] _Rajaz_ primarily means \"a tremor (which is a symptom of disease)\r\nin the hind-quarters of a camel.\" This suggested to Dr. G. Jacob his\r\ninteresting theory that the Arabian metres arose out of the\r\ncamel-driver's song (_ḥidá_) in harmony with the varying paces of the\r\nanimal which he rode (_Studien in arabischen Dichtern_, Heft III, p. 179\r\nsqq.).\r\n\r\n[146] The Arabic verse (_bayt_) consists of two halves or hemistichs\r\n(_miṣrá‘_). It is generally convenient to use the word 'line' as a\r\ntranslation of _miṣrá‘_, but the reader must understand that the\r\n'line' is not, as in English poetry, an independent unit. _Rajaz_ is the\r\nsole exception to this rule, there being here no division into\r\nhemistichs, but each line (verse) forming an unbroken whole and rhyming\r\nwith that which precedes it.\r\n\r\n[147] In Arabic 'al-bayt,' the tent, which is here used figuratively for\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\n[148] Ibn Qutayba, _Kitábu ’l-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_, p. 36, l. 3 sqq.\r\n\r\n[149] Already in the sixth century A.D. the poet ‘Antara complains that\r\nhis predecessors have left nothing new for him to say (_Mu‘allaqa_, v.\r\n1).\r\n\r\n[150] _Ancient Arabian Poetry_, Introduction, p. xvi.\r\n\r\n[151] _Qaṣída_ is explained by Arabian lexicographers to mean a poem\r\nwith an artistic purpose, but they differ as to the precise sense in\r\nwhich 'purpose' is to be understood. Modern critics are equally at\r\nvariance. Jacob (_Stud. in Arab. Dichtern_, Heft III, p. 203) would\r\nderive the word from the principal motive of these poems, namely, to\r\ngain a rich reward in return for praise and flattery. Ahlwardt\r\n(_Bemerkungen über die Aechtheit der alten Arab. Gedichte_, p. 24 seq.)\r\nconnects it with _qaṣada, to break_, \"because it consists of verses,\r\nevery one of which is divided into two halves, with a common end-rhyme:\r\nthus the whole poem is _broken_, as it were, into two halves;\" while in\r\nthe _Rajaz_ verses, as we have seen (p. 74 _supra_), there is no such\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n[152] _Kitábu ’l-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_, p. 14, l. 10 sqq.\r\n\r\n[153] Nöldeke (_Fünf Mo‘allaqát_, i, p. 3 sqq.) makes the curious\r\nobservation, which illustrates the highly artificial character of this\r\npoetry, that certain animals well known to the Arabs (_e.g._, the\r\npanther, the jerboa, and the hare) are seldom mentioned and scarcely\r\never described, apparently for no reason except that they were not\r\nincluded in the conventional repertory.\r\n\r\n[154] _Ancient Arabian Poetry_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[155] Verses 3-13.

It has been translated into English\r\nverse by G. Hughes (London, 1896). Other versions are mentioned by\r\nNöldeke, _Beiträge zur Kenntniss d. Poesie d. alten Araber_, p. 200.\r\n\r\n[156] The poet, apparently, means that his three friends are _like_ the\r\nanimals mentioned. Prof. Bevan remarks, however, that this\r\ninterpretation is doubtful, since an Arab would scarcely compare his\r\n_friend_ to a hyena.\r\n\r\n[157] _Ḥamása_, 242.\r\n\r\n[158] _Ḥamása_, 41-43.

Although these verses are not Pre-islamic, and\r\nbelong in fact to a comparatively late period of Islam, they are\r\nsufficiently pagan in feeling to be cited in this connection.

The other renderings in verse with\r\nwhich I am acquainted are those of Rückert (_Hamâsa_, vol. i, p. 299)\r\nand Sir Charles Lyall (_Ancient Arabian Poetry_, p. 48). I have adopted\r\nSir Charles Lyall's arrangement of the poem, and have closely followed\r\nhis masterly interpretation, from which I have also borrowed some turns\r\nof phrase that could not be altered except for the worse.\r\n\r\n[195] The Arabic text will be found in the _Hamása_, p. 382 sqq.\r\n\r\n[196] This and the following verse are generally taken to be a\r\ndescription not of the poet himself, but of his nephew. The\r\ninterpretation given above does no violence to the language, and greatly\r\nenhances the dramatic effect.\r\n\r\n[197] In the original this and the preceding verse are transposed.\r\n\r\n[198] Although the poet's uncle was killed in this onslaught, the\r\nsurprised party suffered severely. \"The two clans\" belonged to the great\r\ntribe of Hudhayl, which is mentioned in the penultimate verse.\r\n\r\n[199] It was customary for the avenger to take a solemn vow that he\r\nwould drink no wine before accomplishing his vengeance.\r\n\r\n[200] _Ḥamása_, 679.\r\n\r\n[201] _Cf._ the lines translated below from the _Mu‘allaqa_ of\r\nḤárith.\r\n\r\n[202] The best edition of the _Mu‘allaqát_ is Sir Charles Lyall's (_A\r\nCommentary on Ten Ancient Arabic Poems_, Calcutta, 1894), which contains\r\nin addition to the seven _Mu‘allaqát_ three odes by A‘shá, Nábigha, and\r\n‘Abíd b. al-Abraṣ.

Klasse_, vols. 140-144 (1899-1901); this is by far the\r\nbest translation for students. No satisfactory version in English prose\r\nhas hitherto appeared, but I may call attention to the fine and\r\noriginal, though somewhat free, rendering into English verse by Lady\r\nAnne Blunt and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt (_The Seven Golden Odes of Pagan\r\nArabia_, London, 1903).\r\n\r\n[203] _Ancient Arabian Poetry_, Introduction, p. xliv. Many other\r\ninterpretations have been suggested--_e.g._, 'The Poems written down\r\nfrom oral dictation' (Von Kremer), 'The richly bejewelled' (Ahlwardt),\r\n'The Pendants,' as though they were pearls strung on a necklace (A.\r\nMüller).\r\n\r\n[204] The belief that the _Mu‘allaqát_ were written in letters of gold\r\nseems to have arisen from a misunderstanding of the name _Mudhhabát_ or\r\n_Mudhahhabát_ (_i.e._, the Gilded Poems) which is sometimes given to\r\nthem in token of their excellence, just as the Greeks gave the title\r\nχρύσεα ἔπη to a poem falsely attributed to Pythagoras. That some of\r\nthe _Mu‘allaqát_ were recited at ‘Ukáẓ is probable enough and is\r\ndefinitely affirmed in the case of ‘Amr b. Kulthúm (_Aghání_, ix, 182).\r\n\r\n[205] The legend first appears in the _‘Iqd al-Faríd_ (ed. of Cairo,\r\n1293 A.H., vol. iii, p. 116 seq.) of Ibn ‘Abdi Rabbihi, who died in 940\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\n[206] See the Introduction to Nöldeke's _Beiträge zur Kenntniss der\r\nPoesie der alten Araber_ (Hannover, 1864), p. xvii sqq., and his article\r\nMo‘allaḳát' in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n[207] It is well known that the order of the verses in the _Mu‘allaqát_,\r\nas they have come down to us, is frequently confused, and that the\r\nnumber of various readings is very large. I have generally followed the\r\ntext and arrangement adopted by Nöldeke in his German translation.\r\n\r\n[208] See p. 42 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[209] _Ancient Arabian Poetry_, p. 105.\r\n\r\n[210] See the account of his life (according to the _Kitábu’ l-Aghání_)\r\nin _Le Diwan d'Amro’lkaïs_, edited with translation and notes by Baron\r\nMacGuckin de Slane (Paris, 1837), pp. 1-51; and in _Amrilkais, der\r\nDichter und König_ by Friedrich Rückert (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1843).\r\n\r\n[211] That he was not, however, the inventor of the Arabian _qaṣída_\r\nas described above (p. 76 sqq.) appears from the fact that he mentions\r\nin one of his verses a certain Ibn Ḥumám or Ibn Khidhám who\r\nintroduced, or at least made fashionable, the prelude with which almost\r\nevery ode begins: a lament over the deserted camping-ground (Ibn\r\nQutayba, _K. al-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_, p. 52).\r\n\r\n[212] The following lines are translated from Arnold's edition of the\r\n_Mu‘allaqát_ (Leipsic, 1850), p. 9 sqq., vv. 18-35.\r\n\r\n[213] The native commentators are probably right in attributing this and\r\nthe three preceding verses (48-51 in Arnold's edition) to the\r\nbrigand-poet, Ta’abbaṭa Sharran.\r\n\r\n[214] We have already (p. 39) referred to the culture of the Christian\r\nArabs of Ḥíra.\r\n\r\n[215] Vv. 54-59 (Lyall); 56-61 (Arnold).\r\n\r\n[216] See Nöldeke, _Fünf Mu‘allaqát_, i, p. 51 seq. According to the\r\ntraditional version (_Aghání_, ix, 179), a band of Taghlibites went\r\nraiding, lost their way in the desert, and perished of thirst, having\r\nbeen refused water by a sept of the Banú Bakr. Thereupon Taghlib\r\nappealed to King ‘Amr to enforce payment of the blood-money which they\r\nclaimed, and chose ‘Amr b. Kulthúm to plead their cause at Ḥíra. So\r\n‘Amr recited his _Mu‘allaqa_ before the king, and was answered by\r\nḤárith on behalf of Bakr.\r\n\r\n[217] Freytag, _Arabum Proverbia_, vol. ii, p. 233.\r\n\r\n[218] _Aghání_, ix, 182.\r\n\r\n[219] Vv. 1-8 (Arnold); in Lyall's edition the penultimate verse is\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n[220] Vv. 15-18 (Lyall); 19-22 (Arnold).\r\n\r\n[221] The Arabs use the term _kunya_ to denote this familiar style of\r\naddress in which a person is called, not by his own name, but 'father of\r\nSo-and-so' (either a son or, as in the present instance, a daughter).\r\n\r\n[222] _I.e._, even the _jinn_ (genies) stand in awe of us.\r\n\r\n[223] Here Ma‘add signifies the Arabs in general.\r\n\r\n[224] Vv. 20-30 (Lyall), omitting vv. 22, 27, 28.\r\n\r\n[225] This is a figurative way of saying that Taghlib has never been\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\n[226] Vv. 46-51 (Lyall), omitting v. 48.\r\n\r\n[227] _I.e._, we will show our enemies that they cannot defy us with\r\nimpunity. This verse, the 93rd in Lyall's edition, is omitted by Arnold.\r\n\r\n[228] Vv. 94-104 (Arnold), omitting vv. 100 and 101. If the last words\r\nare anything more than a poetic fiction, 'the sea' must refer to the\r\nRiver Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[229] Vv. 16-18.\r\n\r\n[230] Vv. 23-26.\r\n\r\n[231] A place in the neighbourhood of Mecca.\r\n\r\n[232] Vv. 40-42 (Lyall); 65-67 (Arnold).\r\n\r\n[233] See _‘Antarah, ein vorislamischer Dichter_, by H. Thorbecke\r\n(Leipzig, 1867).\r\n\r\n[234] I have taken some liberties in this rendering, as the reader may\r\nsee by referring to the verses (44 and 47-52 in Lyall's edition) on\r\nwhich it is based.\r\n\r\n[235] Ghayẓ b. Murra was a descendant of Dhubyán and the ancestor of\r\nHarim and Ḥárith.\r\n\r\n[236] The Ka‘ba.\r\n\r\n[237] This refers to the religious circumambulation (_ṭawáf_).\r\n\r\n[238] Vv. 16-19 (Lyall).\r\n\r\n[239] There is no reason to doubt the genuineness of this passage, which\r\naffords evidence of the diffusion of Jewish and Christian ideas in pagan\r\nArabia. Ibn Qutayba observes that these verses indicate the poet's\r\nbelief in the Resurrection (_K. al-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_, p. 58, l. 12).\r\n\r\n[240] Vv. 27-31.\r\n\r\n[241] The order of these verses in Lyall's edition is as follows: 56,\r\n57, 54, 50, 55, 53, 49, 47, 48, 52, 58.\r\n\r\n[242] Reference has been made above to the old Arabian belief that poets\r\nowed their inspiration to the _jinn_ (genii), who are sometimes called\r\n_shayátín_ (satans). See Goldziher, _Abhand. zur arab. Philologie_, Part\r\nI, pp. 1-14.\r\n\r\n[243] Vv. 1-10 (Lyall), omitting v. 5.\r\n\r\n[244] Vv. 55-60 (Lyall).\r\n\r\n[245] The term _nábigha_ is applied to a poet whose genius is slow in\r\ndeclaring itself but at last \"jets forth vigorously and abundantly\"\r\n(_nabagha_).\r\n\r\n[246] _Díwán_, ed. by Derenbourg, p. 83; Nöldeke's _Delectus_, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[247] He means to say that Nu‘mán has no reason to feel aggrieved\r\nbecause he (Nábigha) is grateful to the Ghassánids for their munificent\r\npatronage; since Nu‘mán does not consider that his own favourites, in\r\nshowing gratitude to himself, are thereby guilty of treachery towards\r\ntheir former patrons.\r\n\r\n[248] _Diwán_, ed. by Derenbourg, p. 76, ii, 21. In another place (p.\r\n81, vi, 6) he says, addressing his beloved:--\r\n\r\n \"Wadd give thee greeting! for dalliance with women is lawful to me\r\n    no more,\r\n  Since Religion has become a serious matter.\"\r\n\r\nWadd was a god worshipped by the pagan Arabs.

I may as well\r\nsay at once that I entirely disagree with the view suggested in this\r\npassage that Muḥammad did not believe himself to be inspired.\r\n\r\n[272] The above details are taken from the _Fihrist_, ed. by G.

Studien_, Part II, p. 48 seq.\r\n\r\n[280] The reader may consult Muir's Introduction to his _Life of\r\nMahomet_, pp. 28-87.\r\n\r\n[281] Ibn Hishám, p. 105, l. 9 sqq.\r\n\r\n[282] This legend seems to have arisen out of a literal interpretation\r\nof Koran, xciv, 1, \"_Did we not open thy breast?_\"--_i.e._, give thee\r\ncomfort or enlightenment.\r\n\r\n[283] This name, which may signify 'Baptists,' was applied by the\r\nheathen Arabs to Muḥammad and his followers, probably in consequence\r\nof the ceremonial ablutions which are incumbent upon every Moslem before\r\nthe five daily prayers (see Wellhausen, _Reste Arab. Heid._, p. 237).\r\n\r\n[284] Sir Charles Lyall, _The Words 'Ḥaníf' and 'Muslim,'_ _J.R.A.S._\r\nfor 1903, p. 772. The original meaning of _ḥaníf_ is no longer\r\ntraceable, but it may be connected with the Hebrew _ḥánéf_,\r\n'profane.' In the Koran it generally refers to the religion of Abraham,\r\nand sometimes appears to be nearly synonymous with _Muslim_. Further\r\ninformation concerning the Ḥanífs will be found in Sir Charles\r\nLyall's article cited above; Sprenger, _Das Leben und die Lehre des\r\nMoḥammed_, vol. i, pp. 45-134; Wellhausen, _Reste Arab. Heid._, p.\r\n238 sqq.; Caetani, _Annali dell' Islam_, vol. i, pp. 181-192.\r\n\r\n[285] Ibn Hishám, p. 143, l. 6 sqq.\r\n\r\n[286] _Aghání_, iii, 187, l. 17 sqq.\r\n\r\n[287] See p. 69 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[288] Tradition associates him especially with Waraqa, who was a cousin\r\nof his first wife, Khadíja, and is said to have hailed him as a prophet\r\nwhile Muḥammad himself was still hesitating (Ibn Hishám, p. 153, l.\r\n14 sqq.).\r\n\r\n[289] This is the celebrated 'Night of Power' (_Laylatu ’l-Qadr_)\r\nmentioned in the Koran, xcvii, 1.\r\n\r\n[290] The Holy Ghost (_Rúḥu’l-Quds_), for whom in the Medína Súras\r\nGabriel (Jibríl) is substituted.\r\n\r\n[291] But another version (Ibn Hishám, p. 152, l. 9 sqq.) represents\r\nMuḥammad as replying to the Angel, \"What am I to read?\" (_má aqra’u_\r\nor _má dhá aqra’u_). Professor Bevan has pointed out to me that the\r\ntradition in this form bears a curious resemblance, which can hardly be\r\naccidental, to the words of Isaiah xl. 6: \"The voice said, Cry. And he\r\nsaid, What shall I cry?\" The question whether the Prophet could read and\r\nwrite is discussed by Nöldeke (_Geschichte des Qorâns_, p. 7 sqq.), who\r\nleaves it undecided. According to Nöldeke (_loc. cit._, p. 10), the\r\nepithet _ummí_, which is applied to Muḥammad in the Koran, and is\r\ncommonly rendered by 'illiterate,' does not signify that he was ignorant\r\nof reading and writing, but only that he was unacquainted with the\r\nancient Scriptures; _cf._ 'Gentile.' However this may be, it appears\r\nthat he wished to pass for illiterate, with the object of confirming the\r\nbelief in his inspiration: \"_Thou_\" (Muḥammad) \"_didst not use to\r\nread any book before this_\" (the Koran) \"_nor to write it with thy right\r\nhand; else the liars would have doubted_\" (Koran, xxix, 47).\r\n\r\n[292] The meaning of these words (_iqra’ bismi rabbika_) is disputed.\r\nOthers translate, \"Preach in the name of thy Lord\" (Nöldeke), or\r\n\"Proclaim the name of thy Lord\" (Hirschfeld). I see no sufficient\r\ngrounds for abandoning the traditional interpretation supported by\r\nverses 4 and 5. Muḥammad dreamed that he was commanded to read the\r\nWord of God inscribed in the Heavenly Book which is the source of all\r\nRevelation.\r\n\r\n[293] Others render, \"who taught (the use of) the Pen.\"\r\n\r\n[294] This account of Muḥammad's earliest vision (Bukhárí, ed. by\r\nKrehl, vol. iii, p. 380, l. 2 sqq.) is derived from ‘A’isha, his\r\nfavourite wife, whom he married after the death of Khadíja.\r\n\r\n[295] Ibn Hishám, p. 152, l. 9 sqq.\r\n\r\n[296] See p. 72 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[297] This interval is known as the Fatra.\r\n\r\n[298] Literally, 'warn.'\r\n\r\n[299] 'The abomination' (_al-rujz_) probably refers to idolatry.\r\n\r\n[300] Literally, \"The Last State shall be better for thee than the\r\nFirst,\" referring either to Muḥammad's recompense in the next world\r\nor to the ultimate triumph of his cause in this world.\r\n\r\n[301] _Islám_ is a verbal noun formed from _Aslama_, which means 'to\r\nsurrender' and, in a religious sense, 'to surrender one's self to the\r\nwill of God.' The participle, _Muslim_ (Moslem), denotes one who thus\r\nsurrenders himself.\r\n\r\n[302] Sprenger, _Leben des Mohammad_, vol. i, p. 356.\r\n\r\n[303] It must be remembered that this branch of Muḥammadan tradition\r\nderives from the pietists of the first century after the Flight, who\r\nwere profoundly dissatisfied with the reigning dynasty (the Umayyads),\r\nand revenged themselves by painting the behaviour of the Meccan\r\nancestors of the Umayyads towards Muḥammad in the blackest colours\r\npossible. The facts tell another story. It is significant that hardly\r\nany case of real persecution is mentioned in the Koran. Muḥammad was\r\nallowed to remain at Mecca and to carry on, during many years, a\r\nreligious propaganda which his fellow-citizens, with few exceptions,\r\nregarded as detestable and dangerous. We may well wonder at the\r\nmoderation of the Quraysh, which, however, was not so much deliberate\r\npolicy as the result of their indifference to religion and of\r\nMuḥammad's failure to make appreciable headway in Mecca.\r\n\r\n[304] Ibn Hishám, p. 168, l. 9. sqq.\r\n\r\n[305] At this time Muḥammad believed the doctrines of Islam and\r\nChristianity to be essentially the same.\r\n\r\n[306] Ṭabarí, i, 1180, 8 sqq. _Cf._ Caetani, _Annali dell' Islam_,\r\nvol. i, p. 267 sqq.\r\n\r\n[307] Muir, _Life of Mahomet_, vol. ii, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[308] We have seen (p. 91 _supra_) that the heathen Arabs disliked\r\nfemale offspring, yet they called their three principal deities the\r\ndaughters of Allah.\r\n\r\n[309] It is related by Ibn Isḥáq (Ṭabarí, i, 1192, 4 sqq.). In his\r\nlearned work, _Annali dell' Islam_, of which the first volume appeared\r\nin 1905, Prince Caetani impugns the authenticity of the tradition and\r\ncriticises the narrative in detail (p. 279 sqq.), but his arguments do\r\nnot touch the main question. As Muir says, \"it is hardly possible to\r\nconceive how the tale, if not founded in truth, could ever have been\r\ninvented.\"\r\n\r\n[310] The Meccan view of Muḥammad's action may be gathered from the\r\nwords uttered by Abú Jahl on the field of Badr--\"O God, bring woe upon\r\nhim who more than any of us hath severed the ties of kinship and dealt\r\ndishonourably!\" (Ṭabarí, i, 1322, l. 8 seq.). Alluding to the Moslems\r\nwho abandoned their native city and fled with the Prophet to Medína, a\r\nMeccan poet exclaims (Ibn Hishám, p. 519, ll. 3-5):--\r\n\r\n   _They_ (the Quraysh slain at Badr) _fell in honour. They\r\n   did not sell their kinsmen for strangers living in a far\r\n   land and of remote lineage;_\r\n\r\n   _Unlike you, who have made friends of Ghassán_ (the people\r\n   of Medína), _taking them instead of us--O, what a shameful\r\n   deed!_\r\n\r\n   _Tis an impiety and a manifest crime and a cutting of all\r\n   ties of blood: your iniquity therein is discerned by men of\r\n   judgment and understanding._\r\n\r\n[311] _Súra_ is properly a row of stones or bricks in a wall.\r\n\r\n[312] See p. 74 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[313] Koran, lxix, 41.\r\n\r\n[314] Nöldeke, _Geschichte des Qorâns_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[315] _I.e._, what it has done or left undone.\r\n\r\n[316] The Last Judgment.\r\n\r\n[317] Moslems believe that every man is attended by two Recording Angels\r\nwho write down his good and evil actions.\r\n\r\n[318] This is generally supposed to refer to the persecution of the\r\nChristians of Najrán by Dhú Nuwás (see p. 26 _supra_). Geiger takes it\r\nas an allusion to the three men who were cast into the fiery furnace\r\n(Daniel, ch. iii).\r\n\r\n[319] See above, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[320] According to Muḥammadan belief, the archetype of the Koran and\r\nof all other Revelations is written on the Guarded Table (_al-Lawḥ\r\nal-Maḥfúẓ_) in heaven.\r\n\r\n[321] Koran, xvii, 69.\r\n\r\n[322] See, for example, the passages translated by Lane in his\r\n_Selections from the Kur-án_ (London, 1843), pp. 100-113.\r\n\r\n[323] _Ikhláṣ_ means 'purifying one's self of belief in any god\r\nexcept Allah.'\r\n\r\n[324] The Prophet's confession of his inability to perform miracles did\r\nnot deter his followers from inventing them after his death. Thus it\r\nwas said that he caused the infidels to see \"the moon cloven asunder\"\r\n(Koran, liv, 1), though, as is plain from the context, these words refer\r\nto one of the signs of the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\n[325] I take this opportunity of calling the reader's attention to a\r\nmost interesting article by my friend and colleague, Professor A. A.\r\nBevan, entitled _The Beliefs of Early Mohammedans respecting a Future\r\nExistence_ (_Journal of Theological Studies_, October, 1904, p. 20\r\nsqq.), where the whole subject is fully discussed.\r\n\r\n[326] Shaddád b. al-Aswad al-Laythí, quoted in the _Risálatu ’l-Ghufrán_\r\nof Abu ’l-‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí (see my article in the _J.R.A.S._ for 1902,\r\npp. 94 and 818); _cf._ Ibn Hishám, p. 530, last line.

See Brockelmann's _Gesch. der Arab.

He contends that ‘Umar's reform was not based on purely ideal\r\ngrounds, but was demanded by the necessities of the case, and that, so\r\nfar from introducing disorder into the finances, his measures were\r\ndesigned to remedy the confusion which already existed.\r\n\r\n[382] Mas‘údí, _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_, v, 479.\r\n\r\n[383] The Arabic text and literal translation of these verses will be\r\nfound in my article on Abu ’l-‘Alá's _Risálatu ’l-Ghufrán_ (_J.R.A.S._\r\nfor 1902, pp. 829 and 342).\r\n\r\n[384] Wellhausen, _Das Arabische Reich und sein Sturz_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[385] _I.e._, the main body of Moslems--_Sunnís_, followers of the\r\n_Sunna_, as they were afterwards called--who were neither Shí‘ites nor\r\nKhárijites, but held (1) that the Caliph must be elected by the Moslem\r\ncommunity, and (2) that he must be a member of Quraysh, the Prophet's\r\ntribe. All these parties arose out of the struggle between ‘Alí and\r\nMu‘áwiya, and their original difference turned solely on the question of\r\nthe Caliphate.\r\n\r\n[386] Brünnow, _Die Charidschiten unter den ersten Omayyaden_ (Leiden,\r\n1884), p. 28. It is by no means certain, however, that the Khárijites\r\ncalled themselves by this name. In any case, the term implies\r\n_secession_ (_khurúj_) from the Moslem community, and may be rendered by\r\n'Seceder' or 'Nonconformist.'\r\n\r\n[387] _Cf._ Koran, ix, 112.\r\n\r\n[388] Brünnow, _op. cit._, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[389] Wellhausen, _Die religiös-politischen Oppositionsparteien im alten\r\nIslam_ (_Abhandlungen der Königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu\r\nGöttingen_, _Phil.-Hist. Klasse_, 1901), p. 8 sqq. The writer argues\r\nagainst Brünnow that the oldest Khárijites were not true Bedouins\r\n(_A‘rábí_), and were, in fact, even further removed than the rest of the\r\nmilitary colonists of Kúfa and Baṣra from their Bedouin traditions.\r\nHe points out that the extreme piety of the Readers--their constant\r\nprayers, vigils, and repetitions of the Koran--exactly agrees with what\r\nis related of the Khárijites, and is described in similar language.\r\nMoreover, among the oldest Khárijites we find mention made of a company\r\nclad in long cloaks (_baránis_, pl. of _burnus_), which were at that\r\ntime a special mark of asceticism. Finally, the earliest authority (Abú\r\nMikhnaf in Ṭabarí, i, 3330, l. 6 sqq.) regards the Khárijites as an\r\noffshoot from the Readers, and names individual Readers who afterwards\r\nbecame rabid Khárijites.\r\n\r\n[390] Later, when many non-Arab Moslems joined the Khárijite ranks the\r\nfield of choice was extended so as to include foreigners and even\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n[391] Ṭabarí, ii, 40, 13 sqq.\r\n\r\n[392] Shahrastání, ed. by Cureton, Part I, p. 88. l. 12.\r\n\r\n[393] _Ibid._, p. 86, l. 3 from foot.\r\n\r\n[394] Ṭabarí, ii, 36, ll. 7, 8, 11-16.\r\n\r\n[395] _Ḥamása_, 44.\r\n\r\n[396] Ibn Khallikán, ed. by Wüstenfeld, No. 555, p. 55, l. 4 seq.; De\r\nSlane's translation, vol. ii, p. 523.\r\n\r\n[397] Dozy, _Essai sur l'histoire de l'Islamisme_ (French translation by\r\nVictor Chauvin), p. 219 sqq.\r\n\r\n[398] Wellhausen thinks that the dogmatics of the Shí‘ites are derived\r\nfrom Jewish rather than from Persian sources. See his account of the\r\nSaba’ites in his most instructive paper, to which I have already\r\nreferred, _Die religiös-politischen Oppositionsparteien im alten Islam_\r\n(_Abh. der König. Ges. der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen_, _Phil.-Hist.\r\nKlasse_, 1901), p. 89 sqq.\r\n\r\n[399] Ṭabarí, i, 2942, 2.\r\n\r\n[400] \"_Verily, He who hath ordained the Koran for thee_ (_i.e._, for\r\nMuḥammad) _will bring thee back to a place of return_\" (_i.e._, to\r\nMecca). The ambiguity of the word meaning 'place of return' (_ma‘ád_)\r\ngave some colour to Ibn Sabá's contention that it alluded to the return\r\nof Muḥammad at the end of the world. The descent of Jesus on earth is\r\nreckoned by Moslems among the greater signs which will precede the\r\nResurrection.\r\n\r\n[401] This is a Jewish idea. ‘Alí stands in the same relation to\r\nMuḥammad as Aaron to Moses.\r\n\r\n[402] Ṭabarí, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[403] Shahrastání, ed. by Cureton, p. 132, l. 15.\r\n\r\n[404] _Aghání_, viii, 32, l. 17 sqq. The three sons of ‘Alí are Ḥasan,\r\nḤusayn, and Muḥammad Ibnu ’l-Ḥanafiyya.\r\n\r\n[405] Concerning the origin of these sects see Professor Browne's _Lit.\r\nHist. of Persia_, vol. i, p. 295 seq.\r\n\r\n[406] See Darmesteter's interesting essay, _Le Mahdi depuis les origines\r\nde l'Islam jusqu'à nos jours_ (Paris, 1885). The subject is treated more\r\nscientifically by Snouck Hurgronje in his paper _Der Mahdi_, reprinted\r\nfrom the _Revue coloniale internationale_ (1886).\r\n\r\n[407] _Ṣiddíq_ means 'veracious.' Professor Bevan remarks that in\r\nthis root the notion of 'veracity' easily passes into that of\r\n'endurance,' 'fortitude.'\r\n\r\n[408] Ṭabarí, ii, 546. These 'Penitents' were free Arabs of Kúfa, a\r\nfact which, as Wellhausen has noticed, would seem to indicate that the\r\n_ta‘ziya_ is Semitic in origin.\r\n\r\n[409] Wellhausen, _Die religiös-politischen Oppositionsparteien_, p. 79.\r\n\r\n[410] Ṭabarí, ii, 650, l. 7 sqq.\r\n\r\n[411] Shahrastání, Haarbrücker's translation, Part I, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[412] Von Kremer, _Culturgeschicht_. _Streifzüge_, p. 2 sqq.\r\n\r\n[413] The best account of the early Murjites that has hitherto appeared\r\nis contained in a paper by Van Vloten, entitled _Irdjâ_ (_Z.D.M.G._,\r\nvol. 45, p. 161 sqq.). The reader may also consult Shahrastání,\r\nHaarbrücker's trans., Part I, p. 156 sqq.; Goldziher, _Muhammedanische\r\nStudien_, Part II, p. 89 sqq.; Van Vloten, _La domination Arabe_, p. 31\r\nseq.\r\n\r\n[414] Van Vloten thinks that in the name 'Murjite' (_murji’_) there is\r\nan allusion to Koran, ix, 107: \"_And others are remanded (murjawna)\r\nuntil God shall decree; whether He shall punish them or take pity on\r\nthem--for God is knowing and wise._\"\r\n\r\n[415] _Cf._ the poem of Thábit Quṭna (_Z.D.M.G._, _loc. cit._, p.\r\n162), which states the whole Murjite doctrine in popular form. The\r\nauthor, who was himself a Murjite, lived in Khurásán during the latter\r\nhalf of the first century A.H.\r\n\r\n[416] Van Vloten, _La domination Arabe_, p. 29 sqq.\r\n\r\n[417] Ibn Ḥazm, cited in _Z.D.M.G._, vol. 45, p. 169, n. 7. Jahm (†\r\nabout 747 A.D.) was a Persian, as might be inferred from the boldness of\r\nhis speculations.\r\n\r\n[418] Ḥasan himself inclined for a time to the doctrine of free-will,\r\nbut afterwards gave it up (Ibn Qutayba, _Kitábu ’l-Ma‘árif_, p. 225). He\r\nis said to have held that everything happens by fate, except sin\r\n(_Al-Mu‘tazilah_, ed. by T. W. Arnold, p. 12, l. 3 from foot). See,\r\nhowever, Shahrastání, Haarbrücker's trans., Part I, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[419] Koran, lxxiv, 41.\r\n\r\n[420] _Ibid._, xli, 46.\r\n\r\n[421] _Kitábu ’l-Ma‘árif_, p. 301. Those who held the doctrine of\r\nfree-will were called the Qadarites (_al-Qadariyya_), from _qadar_\r\n(power), which may denote (1) the power of God to determine human\r\nactions, and (2) the power of man to determine his own actions. Their\r\nopponents asserted that men act under compulsion (_jabr_); hence they\r\nwere called the Jabarites (_al-Jabariyya_).\r\n\r\n[422] As regards Ghaylán see _Al-Mu‘tazilah_, ed. by T. W.

According to Professor De Goeje, _al-Saffáḥ_ means 'the\r\nmunificent' (literally, 'pouring out' gifts, &c.). In any case it is\r\nimportant to notice that the name was given to certain Pre-islamic\r\nchieftains. Thus Salama b. Khálid, who commanded the Banú Taghlib at the\r\nfirst battle of al-Kuláb (Ibnu ’l-Athír, ed. by Tornberg, vol. i, p.\r\n406, last line), is said to have been called _al-Saffáḥ_ because he\r\n'emptied out' the skin bottles (_mazád_) of his army before a battle\r\n(Ibn Durayd, ed. by Wüstenfeld, p. 203, l. 16); and we find mention of a\r\npoet named al-Saffáḥ b. ‘Abd Manát (_ibid._, p. 277, penult. line).\r\n\r\n[479] See p. 205.\r\n\r\n[480] G. Le Strange, _Baghdad under the Abbasid Caliphate_, p. 4 seq.\r\n\r\n[481] Professor De Goeje has kindly given me the following\r\nreferences:--Ṭabarí, ii, 78, l. 10, where Ziyád is called the _Wazír_\r\nof Mu‘áwiya; Ibn Sa‘d, iii, 121, l. 6 (Abú Bakr the _Wazír_ of the\r\nProphet). The word occurs in Pre-islamic poetry (Ibn Qutayba, _K.\r\nal-Shi‘r wa-’l-Shu‘ará_, p. 414, l. 1). Professor De Goeje adds that the\r\n‘Abbásid Caliphs gave the name _Wazír_ as title to the minister who was\r\nformerly called _Kátib_ (Secretary). Thus it would seem that the Arabic\r\n_Wazír_ (literally 'burden-bearer'), who was at first merely a 'helper'\r\nor 'henchman,' afterwards became the representative and successor of the\r\n_Dapír_ (official scribe or secretary) of the Sásánian kings.\r\n\r\n[482] This division is convenient, and may be justified on general\r\ngrounds. In a strictly political sense, the period of decline begins\r\nthirty years earlier with the Caliphate of Ma’mún (813-833 A.D.). The\r\nhistorian Abu ’l-Maḥásin († 1469 A.D.) dates the decline of the\r\nCaliphate from the accession of Muktafí in 902 A.D. (_al-Nujúm\r\nal-Záhira_, ed. by Juynboll, vol. ii, p. 134).\r\n\r\n[483] See Nöldeke's essay, _Caliph Manṣur_, in his _Sketches from\r\nEastern History_, trans. by J. S.

These lines are aimed, as has been remarked by S.\r\nKhuda Bukhsh (_Contributions to the History of Islamic Civilisation_,\r\nCalcutta, 1905, p. 92), against Nabatæans who falsely claimed to be\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n[512] The name is derived from Koran, xlix, 13: \"_O Men, We have created\r\nyou of a male and a female and have made you into peoples_ (shu‘úban)\r\n_and tribes, that ye might know one another. Verily the noblest of you\r\nin the sight of God are they that do most fear Him._\" Thus the\r\ndesignation 'Shu‘úbite' emphasises the fact that according to\r\nMuḥammad's teaching the Arab Moslems are no better than their\r\nnon-Arab brethren.\r\n\r\n[513] _Muhamm.

Others attribute his conversion to disgust with the\r\nimmorality and profanity of the court-poets amongst whom he lived.\r\n\r\n[535] Possibly he alludes to these aspersions in the verse (_ibid._, p.\r\n153, l. 10): \"_Men have become corrupted, and if they see any one who is\r\nsound in his religion, they call him a heretic_\" (_mubtadi‘_).\r\n\r\n[536] Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya declares that knowledge is derived from three\r\nsources, logical reasoning (_qiyás_), examination (_‘iyár_), and oral\r\ntradition (_samá‘_).

It\r\nappears highly improbable that Abu ’l-‘Atáhiya was a Shí‘ite. _Cf._ the\r\nverses (_Díwán_, p. 104, l. 13 seq.), where, speaking of the prophets\r\nand the holy men of ancient Islam, he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"_Reckon first among them Abú Bakr, the veracious,\r\n    And exclaim 'O ‘Umar!' in the second place of honour.\r\n    And reckon the father of Ḥasan after ‘Uthmán,\r\n    For the merit of them both is recited and celebrated._\"\r\n\r\n[539] _Aghání_, iii, 128, l. 6 sqq.\r\n\r\n[540] _Transactions of the Ninth Congress of Orientalists_, vol. ii. p.\r\n114.\r\n\r\n[541] _Díwán_, p. 274, l. 10. _Cf._ the verse (p. 199, penultimate\r\nline):--\r\n\r\n  \"_When I gained contentment, I did not cease (thereafter)\r\n  To be a king, regarding riches as poverty._\"\r\n\r\nThe ascetic \"lives the life of a king\" (_ibid._, p. 187, l. 5).\r\nContented men are the noblest of all (p. 148, l. 2). So the great\r\nPersian mystic, Jalálu ’l-Dín Rúmí, says in reference to the perfect\r\nṢúfí (_Díván-i Shams-i Tabríz_, No. viii, v. 3 in my edition):\r\n_Mard-i khudá sháh buvad zír-i dalq_, \"the man of God is a king 'neath\r\ndervish-cloak;\" and eminent spiritualists are frequently described as\r\n\"kings of the (mystic) path.\" I do not deny, however, that this metaphor\r\nmay have been originally suggested by the story of Buddha.\r\n\r\n[542] _Díwán_, p. 25, l. 3 sqq.

Ṣafadí, however, says in his commentary\r\non Ṭughrá’í's ode (I translate from a MS. copy in my possession): \"It\r\nis named _Lámiyyatu ’l-‘Ajam_ by way of comparing it with the _Lámiyyatu\r\n’l-‘Arab_, because it resembles the latter in its wise sentences and\r\nmaxims.\"\r\n\r\n[613] _I.e._, the native of Abúṣir (Búṣír), a village in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[614] The _Burda_, ed. by C. A. Ralfs (Vienna, 1860), verse 140; _La\r\nBordah traduite et commentée par René Basset_ (Paris, 1894), verse 151.\r\n\r\n[615] This appears to be a reminiscence of the fact that Muḥammad\r\ngave his own mantle as a gift to Ka‘b b. Zuhayr, when that poet recited\r\nhis famous ode, _Bánat Su‘ád_ (see p. 127 _supra_).\r\n\r\n[616] _Maqáma_ (plural, _maqámát_) is properly 'a place of standing';\r\nhence, an assembly where people stand listening to the speaker, and in\r\nparticular, an assembly for literary discussion. At an early period\r\nreports of such conversations and discussions received the name of\r\n_maqámát_ (see Brockelmann, _Gesch. der Arab. Litteratur_, vol. i, p.\r\n94). The word in its literary sense is usually translated by 'assembly,'\r\nor by the French '_séance_.'\r\n\r\n[617] _The Assemblies of al-Ḥarírí_, translated from the Arabic, with\r\nan introduction and notes by T. Chenery (1867), vol. i, p. 19. This\r\nexcellent work contains a fund of information on diverse matters\r\nconnected with Arabian history and literature. Owing to the author's\r\ndeath it was left unfinished, but a second volume (including\r\n_Assemblies_ 27-50) by F. Steingass appeared in 1898.\r\n\r\n[618] A full account of his career will be found in the Preface to\r\nHoutsma's _Recueil de textes relatifs à l'histoire des Seldjoucides_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 11 sqq. _Cf._ Browne's _Lit. Hist. of Persia_, vol. ii, p.\r\n360.\r\n\r\n[619] This is a graceful, but probably insincere, tribute to the\r\nsuperior genius of Hamadhání.\r\n\r\n[620] The above passage is taken, with some modification, from the\r\nversion of Ḥarírí published in 1850 by Theodore Preston, Fellow of\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, who was afterwards Lord Almoner's Professor\r\nof Arabic (1855-1871).\r\n\r\n[621] Moslems had long been familiar with the fables of Bidpai, which\r\nwere translated from the Pehleví into Arabic by Ibnu ’l-Muqaffa‘ (†\r\n_circa_ 760 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[622] _Al-Fakhrí_, ed. by Derenbourg, p. 18, l. 4 sqq.\r\n\r\n[623] A town in Mesopotamia, not far from Edessa. It was taken by the\r\nCrusaders in 1101 A.D. (Abu ’l-Fidá, ed. by Reiske, vol. iii, p. 332).\r\n\r\n[624] The 48th _Maqáma_ of the series as finally arranged.\r\n\r\n[625] Chenery, _op. cit._, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[626] This has been done with extraordinary skill by the German poet,\r\nFriedrich Rückert (_Die Verwandlungen des Abu Seid von Serug_, 2nd ed.\r\n1837), whose work, however, is not in any sense a translation.\r\n\r\n[627] A literal translation of these verses, which occur in the sixth\r\n_Assembly_, is given by Chenery, _op. cit._, p. 138.\r\n\r\n[628] _Ibid._, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[629] Two grammatical treatises by Ḥarírí have come down to us. In\r\none of these, entitled _Durratu ’l-Ghawwáṣ_ ('The Pearl of the\r\nDiver') and edited by Thorbecke (Leipzig, 1871), he discusses the\r\nsolecisms which people of education are wont to commit.\r\n\r\n[630] See Chenery, _op. cit._, pp. 83-97.\r\n\r\n[631] _The Caliphate, its Rise, Decline, and Fall_, p. 573.\r\n\r\n[632] Another example is ‘Umar al-Khayyámí for ‘Umar Khayyám. The\r\nspelling Ghazzálí (with a double _z_) was in general use when Ibn\r\nKhallikán wrote his Biographical Dictionary in 1256 A.D. (see De Slane's\r\ntranslation, vol. i, p. 80), but according to Sam‘ání the name is\r\nderived from Ghazála, a village near Ṭús; in which case Ghazálí is\r\nthe correct form of the _nisba_. I have adopted 'Ghazalí' in deference\r\nto Sam‘ání's authority, but those who write 'Ghazzálí' can at least\r\nclaim that they err in very good company.\r\n\r\n[633] Shamsu ’l-Dín al-Dhahabí († 1348 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[634] ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥím al-Isnawí († 1370 A.D.), author of a\r\nbiographical work on the Sháfi‘ite doctors. See Brockelmann, _Gesch. der\r\nArab. Litt._, vol. ii, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[635] Abu ’l-Ma‘álí al-Juwayní, a famous theologian of Naysábúr († 1085\r\nA.D.), received this title, which means 'Imám of the Two Sanctuaries,'\r\nbecause he taught for several years at Mecca and Medína.\r\n\r\n[636] _I.e._, the camp-court of the Seljúq monarch Maliksháh, son of Alp\r\nArslán.\r\n\r\n[637] According to his own account in the _Munqidh_, Ghazálí on leaving\r\nBaghdád went first to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, and then to Mecca.\r\nThe statement that he remained ten years at Damascus is inaccurate.\r\n\r\n[638] The MS. has Fakhru ’l-Dín.\r\n\r\n[639] Ghazálí's return to public life took place in 1106 A.D.\r\n\r\n[640] The correct title of Ibn Ḥazm's work is uncertain. In the Cairo\r\ned. (1321 A.H.) it is called _Kitábu ’l-Fiṣal fi ’l-Milal wa ’l-Ahwá\r\nwa ’l-Niḥal_.\r\n\r\n[641] See p. 195 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[642] Kor. ix, 3. The translation runs (\"This is a declaration) _that\r\nGod is clear of the idolaters, and His Apostle likewise_.\" With the\r\nreading _rasúlihi_ it means that God is clear of the idolaters and also\r\nof His Apostle.\r\n\r\n[643] Ibn Khallikan, De Slane's translation, vol. i, p. 663.\r\n\r\n[644] See p. 128.\r\n\r\n[645] Ibn Khallikán, No. 608; De Slane's translation, vol. iii, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[646] See pp. 131-134, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[647] Goldziher, _Muhammedanische Studien_, Part I, p. 197.\r\n\r\n[648] _Ibid._, p. 195.\r\n\r\n[649] Ibn Qutayba, _Kitábu ’l-Ma‘árif_, p. 269.\r\n\r\n[650] While Abú ‘Ubayda was notorious for his freethinking\r\nproclivities, Aṣma‘í had a strong vein of pietism. See Goldziher,\r\n_loc. cit._, p. 199 and _Abh. zur Arab. Philologie_, Part I, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[651] Professor Browne has given a _résumé_ of the contents in his _Lit.\r\nHist. of Persia_, vol. i, p. 387 seq.\r\n\r\n[652] Ed. by Max Grünert (Leyden, 1900).\r\n\r\n[653] Vol. i ed. by C. Brockelmann (Weimar and Strassburg, 1898-1908).\r\n\r\n[654] The epithet _jáḥiẓ_ means 'goggle-eyed.'\r\n\r\n[655] See p. 267.\r\n\r\n[656] Ibn Khallikán, De Slane's translation, vol. ii, p. 250.\r\n\r\n[657] One of these, the eleventh of the complete work, has been edited\r\nby Ahlwardt: _Anonyme Arabische Chronik_ (Greifswald, 1883). It covers\r\npart of the reign of the Umayyad Caliph, ‘Abdu ’l-Malik (685-705 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[658] The French title is _Les Prairies d'Or_. Brockelmann, in his\r\nshorter _Hist. of Arabic Literature_ (Leipzig, 1901), p. 110, states\r\nthat the correct translation of _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_ is 'Goldwäschen.'\r\n\r\n[659] Concerning Ṭabarí and his work the reader should consult De\r\nGoeje's Introduction (published in the supplementary volume containing\r\nthe Glossary) to the Leyden edition, and his excellent article on\r\nṬabarí and early Arab Historians in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n[660] Abu ’l-Maḥásin, ed. by Juynboll, vol. i, p. 608.\r\n\r\n[661] _Selection from the Annals of Tabarí_, ed. by M.

A translation of this passage by De Sacy will be found\r\nin Barbier de Meynard's edition of the _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_, vol. ix, p.\r\n302 sqq.\r\n\r\n[669] See _Murúj_, vol. i, p. 201, and vol. iii, p. 268.\r\n\r\n[670] _Ibid._, vol. ii, p. 372 sqq.\r\n\r\n[671] De Sacy renders the title by 'Le Livre de l'Indication et de\r\nl'Admonition ou l'Indicateur et le Moniteur'; but see De Goeje's edition\r\nof the text (Leyden, 1894), p. xxvii.\r\n\r\n[672] The full title is _Kitábu ’l-Kámil fi ’l-Ta’ríkh_, or 'The Perfect\r\nBook of Chronicles.' It has been edited by Tornberg in fourteen volumes\r\n(Leyden, 1851-1876).\r\n\r\n[673] Ibn Khallikán, De Slane's translation, vol. ii, p. 289.\r\n\r\n[674] An excellent account of the Arab geographers is given by Guy Le\r\nStrange in the Introduction to his _Palestine under the Moslems_\r\n(London, 1890). De Goeje has edited the works of Ibn Khurdádbih,\r\nIṣṭakhrí, Ibn Ḥawqal, and Muqaddasí in the _Bibliotheca\r\nGeographorum Arabicorum_ (Leyden, 1870, &c.)\r\n\r\n[675] De Slane's translation, vol. iv, p. 9 sqq.\r\n\r\n[676] P. 243.\r\n\r\n[677] The translators employed by the Banú Músá were paid at the rate of\r\nabout 500 dínárs a month (_ibid._, p. 43, l. 18 sqq.).\r\n\r\n[678] _Ibid._, p. 271; Ibn Khallikán, De Slane's translation, vol. iii,\r\np. 315.\r\n\r\n[679] A chapter at least would be required in order to set forth\r\nadequately the chief material and intellectual benefits which European\r\ncivilisation has derived from the Arabs.

See Goldziher, _Muhamm. Studien_, Part II,\r\np. 401 seq.\r\n\r\n[691] _Al-Nujúm al-Záhira_, ed. by Juynboll, vol. i, p. 639.\r\n\r\n[692] This is the literal translation of _Ikhwánu ’l-Safá_, but\r\naccording to Arabic idiom 'brother of purity' (_akhu ’l-ṣafá_) simply\r\nmeans 'one who is pure or sincere,' as has been shown by Goldziher,\r\n_Muhamm. Studien_, Part I, p. 9, note. The term does not imply any sort\r\nof brotherhood.\r\n\r\n[693] Ibnu ’l-Qifṭí, _Ta’ ríkhu ’l-Ḥukamá_ (ed. by Lippert), p.\r\n83, l. 17 sqq.\r\n\r\n[694] _Notice sur un manuscrit de la secte des Assassins_, by P.\r\nCasanova in the _Journal Asiatique_ for 1898, p 151 sqq.\r\n\r\n[695] De Goeje, _Mémoire sur les Carmathes_, p. 172.\r\n\r\n[696] _Ṣâliḥ b. ‘Abd al-Quddûs und das Zindîḳthum während der\r\nRegierung des Chalifen al-Mahdí in Transactions of the Ninth Congress of\r\nOrientalists_, vol. ii, p. 105 seq.\r\n\r\n[697] Ṭabarí, iii, 522, 1.\r\n\r\n[698] _I.e._ the sacred books of the Manichæans, which were often\r\nsplendidly illuminated.

Studien_, Part II, p. 161 sqq.\r\n\r\n[704] The Arabic text of these verses will be found in Goldziher's\r\nmonograph, p. 122, ll. 6-7.\r\n\r\n[705] See a passage from the _Kitábu ’l-Ḥayawán_, cited by Baron V.\r\nRosen in _Zapiski_, vol. vi, p. 337, and rendered into English in my\r\n_Translations from Eastern Poetry and Prose_, p. 53. Probably these\r\nmonks were Manichæans, not Buddhists.\r\n\r\n[706] _Zaddíq_ is an Aramaic word meaning 'righteous.' Its etymological\r\nequivalent in Arabic is _siddíq_, which has a different meaning, namely,\r\n'veracious.' _Zaddíq_ passed into Persian in the form _Zandík_, which\r\nwas used by the Persians before Islam, and _Zindíq_ is the Arabicised\r\nform of the latter word. For some of these observations I am indebted to\r\nProfessor Bevan. Further details concerning the derivation and meaning\r\nof _Zindíq_ are given in Professor Browne's _Literary Hist. of Persia_\r\n(vol. i, p. 159 sqq.), where the reader will also find a lucid account\r\nof the Manichæan doctrines.\r\n\r\n[707] Ibnu ’l-Athír, vol. viii, p. 229 seq.

Much\r\nadditional information is contained in a lengthy article, which I have\r\nextracted from a valuable MS. in my collection, the _Shadharátu\r\n’l-Dhahab_, and published in the _J.R.A.S._ for 1906, pp. 806-824. _Cf._\r\nalso Von Kremer's _Herrschende Ideen_, pp. 102-109.\r\n\r\n[747] Muḥyi ’l-Dín means 'Reviver of Religion.' In the West he was\r\ncalled Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí, but the Moslems of the East left out the definite\r\narticle (_al_) in order to distinguish him from the Cadi Abú Bakr Ibnu\r\n’l-‘Arabí of Seville († 1151 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[748] _Al-Kibrít al-aḥmar_ (literally, 'the red sulphur').\r\n\r\n[749] See Von Kremer, _op. cit._, p. 108 seq.\r\n\r\n[750] The above particulars are derived from an abstract of the\r\n_Futúḥát_ made by ‘Abdu ’l-Wahháb al-Sha‘rání († 1565 A.D.), of which\r\nFleischer has given a full description in the _Catalogue of Manuscripts\r\nin the Leipzig Univ. Library_ (1838), pp. 490-495.\r\n\r\n[751] Maqqarí, i, 569, 11.\r\n\r\n[752] Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal.\r\n\r\n[753] Abú Ḥanífa.\r\n\r\n[754] _Fuṣúṣu ’l-Ḥikam_ (Cairo, A.H. 1321), p. 78. The words\r\nwithin brackets belong to the commentary of ‘Abdu ’l-Razzáq al-Káshání\r\nwhich accompanies the text.\r\n\r\n[755] Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí uses the term \"Idea of ideas\" (_Ḥaqíqatu\r\n’l-ḥaqá’iq_) as equivalent to λόγος ἐνδιάθετος, while \"the\r\nIdea of Muḥammad\" (_al-Ḥaqíqatu ’l-Muḥammadiyya_) corresponds\r\nto λόγος προφορικός.\r\n\r\n[756] The Arabic text of these verses will be found in the collection of\r\nIbnu ’l-‘Arabí's mystical odes, entitled _Tarjumánu ’l-Ashwáq_, which I\r\nhave edited (Oriental Translation Fund, New Series, vol. xx, p. 19, vv.\r\n13-15).\r\n\r\n[757] Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí has been studied by Asin Palacios, Professor of\r\nArabic at Madrid, whose books are written in Spanish, and H. S. Nyberg\r\n(_Kleinere Schriften des Ibn al-‘Arabí_, Leiden, 1919). A general view\r\nmay be obtained from my _Studies in Islamic Mysticism_, pp. 77-142 and\r\npp. 149-161.\r\n\r\n[758] See Asin Palacios, _Islam and the Divine Comedy_, London, 1926.\r\n\r\n[759] Abridged from Ibnu ’l-‘Idhárí, _al-Bayán al-Mughrib_, ed. by Dozy,\r\nvol. ii, p. 61 seq.\r\n\r\n[760] Ibn Khallikán, ed. by Wüstenfeld, No. 802; De Slane's translation,\r\nvol. iv, p. 29 sqq.\r\n\r\n[761] Muqaddasí (ed. by De Goeje), p. 236, cited by Goldziher, _Die\r\nZâhiriten_, p. 114.\r\n\r\n[762] Dozy, _Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne_ (Leyden, 1861), vol. iii,\r\np. 90 sqq.\r\n\r\n[763] ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III was the first of his line to assume this\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n[764] Maqqarí, vol. i, p. 259. As Maqqarí's work is our principal\r\nauthority for the literary history of Moslem Spain, I may conveniently\r\ngive some account of it in this place. The author, Aḥmad b.\r\nMuḥammad al-Tilimsání al-Maqqarí († 1632 A.D.) wrote a biography of\r\nIbnu ’l-Khaṭíb, the famous Vizier of Granada, to which he prefixed a\r\nlong and discursive introduction in eight chapters: (1) Description of\r\nSpain; (2) Conquest of Spain by the Arabs; (3) History of the Spanish\r\ndynasties; (4) Cordova; (5) Spanish-Arabian scholars who travelled in\r\nthe East; (6) Orientals who visited Spain; (7) Miscellaneous extracts,\r\nanecdotes, poetical citations, &c., bearing on the literary history of\r\nSpain; (8) Reconquest of Spain by the Christians and expulsion of the\r\nArabs. The whole work is entitled _Nafḥu ’l-Ṭíb min ghuṣní\r\n’l-Andalusi ’l-raṭíb wa-dhikri wazírihá Lisáni ’l-Dín Ibni\r\n’l-Khaṭíb_. The introduction, which contains a fund of curious and\r\nvaluable information--\"a library in little\"--has been edited by Dozy and\r\nother European Arabists under the title of _Analectes sur l'Histoire et\r\nla Littérature des Arabes d'Espagne_ (Leyden, 1855-1861).\r\n\r\n[765] The name of Slaves (_Ṣaqáliba_) was originally applied to\r\nprisoners of war, belonging to various northern races, who were sold to\r\nthe Arabs of Spain, but the term was soon widened so as to include all\r\nforeign slaves serving in the harem or the army, without regard to their\r\nnationality. Like the Mamelukes and Janissaries, they formed a\r\nprivileged corps under the patronage of the palace, and since the reign\r\nof ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán III their number and influence had steadily\r\nincreased. _Cf._ Dozy, _Hist. des Mus. d'Espagne_, vol. iii, p. 58 sqq.\r\n\r\n[766] Dozy, _op. cit._, vol. ii, p. 103 seq.\r\n\r\n[767] Qazwíní, _Átháru ’l-Bilád_, ed. by Wüstenfeld, p. 364, l. 5 sqq.\r\n\r\n[768] See Schack, _op. cit._, vol. ii, p. 46 sqq.\r\n\r\n[769] The Arabic original occurs in the 11th chapter of the _Ḥalbatu\r\n’l-Kumayt_, a collection of poems on wine and drinking by Muḥammad b.\r\nḤasan al-Nawájí († 1455 A.D.), and is also printed in the _Anthologie\r\nArabe_ of Grangeret de Lagrange, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[770] _Al-Ḥullat al-Siyará_ of Ibnu ’l-Abbár, ed. by Dozy, p. 34.

Naghdála. See the Introduction to\r\nDozy's ed. of Ibnu ’l-‘Idhárí, p. 84, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[791] An interesting notice of Samuel Ha-Levi is given by Dozy in his\r\n_Hist. des Mus. d'Espagne_, vol. iv, p. 27 sqq.\r\n\r\n[792] _Kámil_ of Ibnu ’l-Athír, ed. by Tornberg, vol. ix, p. 425 sqq.\r\nThe following narrative (which has been condensed as far as possible)\r\ndiffers in some essential particulars from the accounts given by Ibn\r\nKhaldún (_History of the Berbers_, De Slane's translation, vol. ii, p.\r\n64 sqq.) and by Ibn Abí Zar‘ (Tornberg, _Annales Regum Mauritaniæ_, p.\r\n100 sqq. of the Latin version). _Cf._ A.

Such buildings were often\r\noccupied, in addition to the garrison proper, by individuals who, from\r\npious motives, wished to take part in the holy war (_jihád_) against the\r\nunbelievers. The word _murábiṭ_, therefore, gradually got an\r\nexclusively religious signification, 'devotee' or 'saint,' which appears\r\nin its modern form, _marabout_. As applied to the original Almoravides,\r\nit still retains a distinctly military flavour.\r\n\r\n[796] See Goldziher's article _Materialien zur Kenntniss der\r\nAlmohadenbewegung in Nordafrika_ (_Z.D.M.G._, vol. 41, p. 30 sqq.).\r\n\r\n[797] ‘Abdu ’l-Wáḥid, _History of the Almohades_, ed. by Dozy, p.\r\n135, l. 1 sqq.\r\n\r\n[798] The Berbers at this time were Sunnite and anti-Fáṭimid.\r\n\r\n[799] Almohade is the Spanish form of _al-Muwaḥḥid_.\r\n\r\n[800] Stanley Lane-Poole, _The Mohammadan Dynasties_, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[801] Renan, _Averroës et l'Averroïsme_, p. 12 sqq.\r\n\r\n[802] See a passage from ‘Abdu ’l-Wáhid's _History of the Almohades_ (p.\r\n201, l. 19 sqq.), which is translated in Goldziher's _Ẓâhiriten_, p.\r\n174.\r\n\r\n[803] The Arabic text, with a Latin version by E. Pocock, was published\r\nin 1671, and again in 1700, under the title _Philosophus Autodidactus_.\r\nAn English translation by Simon Ockley appeared in 1708, and has been\r\nseveral times reprinted.\r\n\r\n[804] The true form of this name is Absál, as in Jámí's celebrated poem.\r\n_Cf._ De Boer, _The History of Philosophy in Islam_, translated by E. R.\r\nJones, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[805] Jurjí Zaydán, however, is disposed to regard the story as being\r\nnot without foundation. See his interesting discussion of the evidence\r\nin his _Ta‘ríkhu ’l-Tamaddun al-Islámi_ ('History of Islamic\r\nCivilisation'), Part III, pp. 40-46.\r\n\r\n[806] The life of Ibnu ’l-Khaṭib has been written by his friend and\r\ncontemporary, Ibn Khaldún (_Hist. of the Berbers_, translated by De\r\nSlane, vol. iv. p. 390 sqq.), and forms the main subject of Maqqarí's\r\n_Nafḥu ’l-Ṭíb_ (vols. iii and iv of the Buláq edition).\r\n\r\n[807] Schack, _op. cit._, vol. i, p. 312 seq.\r\n\r\n[808] Cited in the _Shadharátu ’l-Dhahab_, a MS. in my collection. See\r\n_J.R.A.S._ for 1899, p. 911 seq., and for 1906, p. 797.\r\n\r\n[809] The Arabic text of the Prolegomena has been published by\r\nQuatremère in _Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque\r\nImpériale_, vols. 16-18, and at Beyrout (1879, 1886, and 1900). A French\r\ntranslation by De Slane appeared in _Not. et Extraits_, vols. 19-21.\r\n\r\n[810] _Muqaddima_ (Beyrout ed. of 1900), p. 35, l. 5 sqq. = Prolegomena\r\ntranslated by De Slane, vol. i, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[811] _Muqaddima_, p. 37, l. 4 fr. foot = De Slane's translation, vol.\r\ni, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[812] Von Kremer has discussed Ibn Khaldún's ideas more fully than is\r\npossible here in an admirably sympathetic article, _Ibn Chaldun und\r\nseine Culturgeschichte der islamischen Reiche_, contributed to the\r\n_Sitz. der Kais. Akad. der Wissenschaften_, vol. 93 (Vienna, 1879). I\r\nhave profited by many of his observations, and desire to make the\r\nwarmest acknowledgment of my debt to him in this as in countless other\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n[813] _Muqaddima_, Beyrout ed., p. 170 = De Slane's translation, vol. i,\r\np. 347 sqq.\r\n\r\n[814] _Muqaddima_, p. 175 = De Slane's translation, vol. i, p. 356 sqq.\r\n\r\n[815] An excellent appreciation of Ibn Khaldún as a scientific historian\r\nwill be found in Robert Flint's _History of the Philosophy of History_,\r\nvol. i, pp. 157-171.\r\n\r\n[816] Schack, _op. cit._, vol. ii, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[817] E. J. W. Gibb, _A History of Ottoman Poetry_, vol. ii, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[818] The nineteenth century should have been excepted, so far as the\r\ninfluence of modern civilisation has reacted on Arabic literature.\r\n\r\n[819] These Ismál‘ílís are the so-called Assassins, the terrible sect\r\norganised by Ḥasan b. Ṣabbáḥ (see Professor Browne's _Literary\r\nHistory of Persia_, vol. ii, p. 201 sqq.), and finally exterminated by\r\nHúlágú. They had many fortresses, of which Alamút was the most famous,\r\nin the Jibál province, near Qazwín.\r\n\r\n[820] The reader must be warned that this and the following account of\r\nthe treacherous dealings of Ibnu ’l-‘Alqamí are entirely contradicted by\r\nShí‘ite historians. For example, the author of _al-Fakhrí_ (ed. by\r\nDerenbourg, p. 452) represents the Vizier as a far-seeing patriot who\r\nvainly strove to awaken his feeble-minded master to the gravity of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[821] Concerning the various functions of the Dawídár (literally\r\nInkstand-holder) or Dawádár, as the word is more correctly written, see\r\nQuatremère, _Histoire des Sultans Mamlouks_, vol. i, p. 118, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[822] The MS. writes Yájúnas.\r\n\r\n[823] _Al-kalb_, the Arabic equivalent of the Persian _sag_ (dog), an\r\nanimal which Moslems regard as unclean.\r\n\r\n[824] By Shamsu ’l-Dín al-Dhahabí († 1348 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[825] Mameluke (Mamlúk) means 'slave.' The term was applied to the\r\nmercenary troops, Turks and Kurds for the most part, who composed the\r\nbodyguard of the Ayyúbid princes.\r\n\r\n[826] There are two Mameluke dynasties, called respectively Baḥrí\r\n(River) Mamelukes and Burjí (Tower) Mamelukes. The former reigned from\r\n1250 to 1390, the latter from 1382 to 1517.\r\n\r\n[827] See Lane, _The Modern Egyptians_, ch. xxii.\r\n\r\n[828] See Sir T. W. Arnold, _The Caliphate_, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[829] Ed. of Buláq (1283 A.H.), pp. 356-366.\r\n\r\n[830] _Ibid._, p. 358.\r\n\r\n[831] These verses are cited in the _Ḥadíqatu ’l-Afráḥ_ (see\r\nBrockelmann's _Gesch. d. Arab. Litt._, ii, 502), Calcutta, 1229 A.H., p.\r\n280. In the final couplet there is an allusion to Kor. iv, 44: \"_Verily\r\nGod will not wrong any one even the weight of an ant_\" (mithqála\r\ndharratin).\r\n\r\n[832] Hartmann, _Das Muwa[vs][vs]aḥ_ (Weimar, 1897), p. 218.\r\n\r\n[833] Literally, 'The Shaking of the Skull-caps,' in allusion to the\r\npeasants' dance.\r\n\r\n[834] See Vollers, _Beiträge zur Kenntniss der lebenden arabischen\r\nSprache in Aegypten_, _Z.D.M.G._, vol. 41 (1887), p. 370.\r\n\r\n[835] Ibn Khallikán, De Slane's translation, vol. i, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[836] It should be pointed out that the _Wafayát_ is very far from being\r\nexhaustive. The total number of articles only amounts to 865. Besides\r\nthe Caliphs, the Companions of the Prophet, and those of the next\r\ngeneration (_Tábi‘ún_), the author omitted many persons of note because\r\nhe was unable to discover the date of their death. A useful supplement\r\nand continuation of the _Wafayát_ was compiled by al-Kutubí († 1363\r\nA.D.) under the title _Fawátu ’l-Wafayát_.\r\n\r\n[837] The Arabic text of the _Wafayát_ has been edited with variants and\r\nindices by Wüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1835-1850). There is an excellent\r\nEnglish translation by Baron MacGuckin de Slane in four volumes\r\n(1842-1871).\r\n\r\n[838] The full title is _al-Mawá‘iẓ wa-’l-l‘tibár fí dhikri\r\n’l-Khiṭaṭ wa-’l-Athár_. It was printed at Buláq in 1270 A.H.\r\n\r\n[839] _Al-Sulúk li-ma‘rifati Duwali ’l-Mulúk_, a history of the Ayyúbids\r\nand Mamelukes.

The simplicity of its style and the varied interest of its\r\ncontents have made it deservedly popular. Leaving the Koran out of\r\naccount, I do not know any book that is better fitted to serve as an\r\nintroduction to Arabic literature.\r\n\r\n[842] See p. 413, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[843] _A Biographical Dictionary of Persons who knew Mohammad_, ed. by\r\nSprenger and others (Calcutta, 1856-1873).\r\n\r\n[844] _Murúju ’l-Dhahab_, ed. by Barbier de Meynard, vol. iv. p. 90. The\r\nnames Shírázád and Dínázád are obviously Persian. Probably the former is\r\na corruption of Chihrázád, meaning 'of noble race,' while Dínázád\r\nsignifies 'of noble religion.' My readers will easily recognise the\r\nfamiliar Scheherazade and Dinarzade.\r\n\r\n[845] Strange as it may seem, this criticism represents the view of\r\nnearly all Moslem scholars who have read the 'Arabian Nights.'\r\n\r\n[846] Many episodes are related on the authority of Aṣma‘í, Abú\r\n‘Ubayda, and Wahb b.

See Lane's _Modern Egyptians_, ch. xxiii.\r\n\r\n[848] That it was extant in some shape before 1150 A.D. seems to be\r\nbeyond doubt. _Cf._ the _Journal Asiatique_ for 1838, p. 383;\r\nWüstenfeld, _Gesch. der Arab.

Gibb's\r\n_History of Ottoman Poetry_, vol. i, pp. 343-368. It is highly\r\nimprobable that the story related here gives the true ground on which he\r\nwas condemned: his pantheistic utterances afford a sufficient\r\nexplanation, and the Turkish biographer, Laṭífí, specifies the verse\r\nwhich cost him his life. I may add that the author of the _Shadharátu\r\n’l-Dhahab_ calls him Nasímu ’l-Dín of Tabríz (he is generally said to be\r\na native of Nasím in the district of Baghdád), and observes that he\r\nresided in Aleppo, where his followers were numerous and his heretical\r\ndoctrines widely disseminated.\r\n\r\n[852] The 112th chapter of the Koran.

Burckhardt was in Arabia while the Turks were\r\nengaged in re-conquering the Ḥijáz from the Wahhábís. His graphic and\r\nhighly interesting narrative has been summarised by Dozy, _Essai sur\r\nl'histoire de l'Islamisme_, ch. 13.\r\n\r\n[858] Following Burckhardt's example, most European writers call him\r\nsimply ‘Abdu ’l-Wahháb.\r\n\r\n[859] Burckhardt, _op. cit._, vol. ii, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[860] MSS. of Ibn Taymiyya copied by Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahháb are extant\r\n(Goldziher in _Z.D.M.G._, vol. 52, p. 156).\r\n\r\n[861] This is the place usually called Karbalá or Mashhad Ḥusayn.\r\n\r\n[862] _Op. cit._, vol. ii, p. 112.\r\n\r\n[863] _Essai sur l'histoire de l'Islamisme_, p. 416.\r\n\r\n[864] Burckhardt, _loc. laud._, p. 115.\r\n\r\n[865] I cannot enter into details on this subject.

Mr Gibb has given references to the\r\nchief works on the subject, but for the sake of those who do not read\r\nArabic or Russian it may be hoped that he will continue and complete his\r\nown survey, to which there is nothing _simile aut secundum_ in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nP. xxii, l. 2. Arabic begins to appear in North Arabian inscriptions\r\nin the third century A.D. Perhaps the oldest yet discovered\r\nis one, of which the probable date is 268 A.D., published by Jaussen\r\nand Savignac (_Mission archéologique en l'Arabie_, vol. i, p. 172).\r\nThough it is written in Aramaic characters, nearly all the words\r\nare Arabic, as may be seen from the transcription given by Professor\r\nHorovitz in _Islamic Culture_ (Hyderabad, Deccan), April\r\n1929, vol. iii, No. 2, p. 169, note 2.\r\n\r\nP. 4 foll. Concerning the Sabaeans and the South Arabic inscriptions a\r\ngreat deal of valuable information will be found in the article _Saba’_\r\nby J. Tkatsch in the _Encyclopædia of Islam_. The writer points out the\r\nspecial importance of the epigraphic discoveries of E. Glaser, who, in\r\nthe course of four journeys (1882-94), collected over 2000 inscriptions.\r\nSee also D. Nielsen, _Handbuch der altarabischen Altertumskunde_, vol. i\r\n(Copenhagen and Paris, 1927).\r\n\r\nP. 13, note 2. Excerpts from the _Shamsu ’l-‘Ulúm_ relating\r\nto South Arabia have been edited by Dr ‘Azímu’ddín Aḥmad\r\n(E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Series, vol. xxiv).\r\n\r\nP. 26 foll.

An edition of the _Aghání_ with critical notes is\r\nin course of publication at Cairo.\r\n\r\nP. 52, l. 9 foll. The battle mentioned here cannot be the battle\r\nof ‘Ayn Ubágh, which took place between Ḥárith, the son of\r\nḤárith b. Jabala, and Mundhir IV of Ḥíra about 583 A.D.

As regards the authenticity of the Pre-islamic poems\r\nwhich have come down to us, the observations of one of the\r\ngreatest authorities on the subject, the late Sir Charles J. Lyall,\r\nseem to me to be eminently judicious (Introduction to the\r\n_Mufaḍḍalīyāt_, vol. ii, pp. xvi-xxvi). He concludes that\r\n\"upon the whole, the impression which a close study of these ancient\r\nrelics gives is that we must take them, generally speaking, as the\r\nproduction of the men whose names they bear.\" All that can be urged\r\nagainst this view has been said with his usual learning by Professor\r\nMargoliouth (_The Origins of Arabic Poetry_, _J.R.A.S._, 1925, p. 417\r\nfoll.).\r\n\r\nP. 145, l. 2. The oldest extant commentary on the Koran is that of\r\nBukhárí in ch. 65 of the _Ṣaḥíḥ_, ed. Krehl, vol. iii, pp.\r\n193-390.\r\n\r\nP. 146, note 2. Recent investigators (Caetani and Lammens)\r\nare far more sceptical. Cf. Snouck Hurgronje, _Mohammedanism_,\r\np. 22 foll.\r\n\r\nP. 152, note 5. As suggested by Mr Richard Bell (_The Origin\r\nof Islam in its Christian environment_, p. 88), the word _rujz_ is in\r\nall likelihood identical with the Syriac _rugza_, wrath, so that this\r\nverse of the Koran means, \"Flee from the wrath to come.\"\r\n\r\nP. 170, l. 2 foll. This is one of the passages I should have liked\r\nto omit. Even in its present form, it maintains a standpoint\r\nwhich I have long regarded as mistaken.\r\n\r\nP. 184, l. 4 foll. Professor Snouck Hurgronje (_Mohammedanism_,\r\np. 44) asks, \"Was Mohammed conscious of the universality of his\r\nmission?\" and decides that he was not. I now agree that \"in\r\nthe beginning he conceived his work as merely the Arabian part\r\nof a universal task\"--in which case _dhikrun li ’l-‘álamín_ in the\r\npassage quoted will mean \"a warning to all the people (of Mecca\r\nor Arabia).\" But similar expressions in Súras of the Medina\r\nperiod carry, I think, a wider significance. The conception of\r\nIslam as a world-religion is implied in Mohammed's later belief--he\r\nonly came to it gradually--that the Jewish and Christian\r\nscriptures are corrupt and that the Koran alone represents the\r\noriginal Faith which had been preached in turn by all the\r\nprophets before him. And having arrived at that conviction,\r\nhe was not the man to leave others to act upon it.\r\n\r\nP. 223, l. 9. In an article which appeared in the _Rivista degli studi\r\norientali_, 1916, p. 429 foll., Professor C. A. Nallino has shown that\r\nthis account of the origin of the name \"Mu‘tazilite\" is erroneous. The\r\nword, as Mas‘údí says (_Murúju ’l-Dhahab_, vol. vi, p. 22, and vol. vii,\r\np. 234), is derived from _i‘tizál_, _i.e._ the doctrine that anyone who\r\ncommits a capital sin has thereby withdrawn himself (_i‘tazala_) from\r\nthe true believers and taken a position (described as _fisq_, impiety)\r\nmidway between them and the infidels. According to the Murjites, such a\r\nperson was still a true believer, while their opponents, the Wa‘ídites,\r\nand also the Khárijites, held him to be an unbeliever.\r\n\r\nP. 225, l. 1. The Ḥadíth, \"No monkery (_rahbániyya_) in Islam,\"\r\nprobably dates from the third century of the Hijra. According\r\nto the usual interpretation of Koran, LVII, 27, the _rahbániyya_\r\npractised by Christian ascetics is condemned as an innovation\r\nnot authorised by divine ordinance; but Professor Massignon\r\n(_Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane_,\r\np. 123 foll.) shows that by some of the early Moslem commentators\r\nand also by the Ṣúfís of the third century A.H. this verse of the\r\nKoran was taken as justifying and commending those Christians\r\nwho devoted themselves to the ascetic life, except in so far as they\r\nhad neglected to fulfil its obligations.\r\n\r\nP. 225, l. 6 from foot. For the life and doctrines of Ḥasan of\r\nBaṣra, see Massignon, _op. cit._, p. 152 foll.\r\n\r\nP. 228 foll. It can now be stated with certainty that the name \"Ṣúfí\"\r\noriginated in Kúfa in the second century A.H. and was at first confined\r\nto the mystics of ‘Iráq. Hence the earliest development of Ṣúfiism,\r\nproperly so called, took place in a hotbed of Shí‘ite and Hellenistic\r\n(Christian and Gnostic) ideas.\r\n\r\nP. 233, l. 4 from foot. In _Rābi‘a the Mystic_ (Cambridge, 1928) Miss\r\nMargaret Smith has given a scholarly and sympathetic account of the\r\nlife, legend, and teaching of this celebrated woman-saint. The statement\r\nthat she died and was buried at Jerusalem is incorrect. Moslem writers\r\nhave confused her with an earlier saint of the same name, Rábi‘a bint\r\nIsmá‘íl († 135).\r\n\r\nP. 313 foll. The text and translation of 332 extracts from the\r\n_Luzúmiyyát_ will be found in ch. ii of my _Studies in Islamic Poetry_,\r\npp. 43-289.\r\n\r\nP. 318, l. 12. Since there is no warrant for the antithesis of\r\n\"knaves\" and \"fools,\" these verses are more faithfully rendered\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 167):\r\n\r\n  They all err--Moslems, Christians, Jews, and Magians;\r\n  Two make Humanity's universal sect:\r\n  One man intelligent without religion,\r\n  And one religious without intellect.\r\n\r\nP. 318, l. 7 from foot. _Al-Fuṣúl wa ’l-Gháyát_. No copy of\r\nthis work was known before 1919, when the discovery of the first\r\npart of it was announced (_J.R.A.S._, 1919, p. 449).\r\n\r\nP. 318, note 2. An edition of the _Risálatu ’l-Ghufrán_ by Shaykh\r\nIbráhím al-Yáziji was published at Cairo in 1907.\r\n\r\nP. 319, l. 6. The epistle of ‘Alí b. Manṣúr al-Ḥalabí (Ibnu\r\n’l-Qáriḥ), to which the _Risálatu ’l-Ghufrán_ is the reply, has been\r\npublished in _Rasá’ilu ’l-Bulaghá_, ed. Muḥammad Kurd ‘Alí\r\n(Cairo, 1913).\r\n\r\nP. 332, note 2. For rhymed prose renderings of the 11th and\r\n12th _Maqámas_, see _Translations of Eastern Poetry and Prose_,\r\npp. 116-124.\r\n\r\nP. 367, l. 7 from foot. New light has recently been thrown\r\nupon the character of the Mu‘tazilite movement by the publication\r\nof the Mu‘tazilite al-Khayyáṭ's _Kitábu ’l-Intiṣár_ (ed. H. S.\r\nNyberg, Cairo, 1926), a third (ninth) century polemical work\r\ndirected against the Shí‘ite freethinker Ibnu ’l-Ráwandí (cf. p. 375\r\n_supra_). It is now evident that this \"heretical\" sect played an\r\nactive part as champions of Islam, not only in the early controversies\r\nwhich arose between Moslems and Christians in Syria but\r\nalso against the more dangerous attacks which proceeded in the\r\nfirst hundred years of the ‘Abbásid period from the Manichæans\r\nand other \"_zanádiqa_\" in Persia and especially in ‘Iráq (cf.\r\nI. Guidi, _La Lotta tra l'Islam e il Manicheismo_ (Rome, 1927)).\r\nIn order to meet these adversaries on equal terms, the Mu‘tazilites\r\nmade themselves acquainted with Greek philosophy and logic,\r\nand thus laid the foundations of an Islamic scholasticism. Cf.\r\nH. H. Schaeder, _Der Orient und die Griechische Erbe_ in W. Jaeger's\r\n_Die Antike_, vol. iv, p. 261 foll.\r\n\r\nP. 370, I. 3 foll. From what has been said in the preceding note it\r\nfollows that this view of the relation between the Mu‘tazilites and the\r\n_Ikhwánu ’l-Ṣafá_ requires considerable modification. Although, in\r\ncontrast to their orthodox opponents, the Mu‘tazilites may be described\r\nas \"rationalists\" and \"liberal theologians,\" their principles were\r\nentirely opposed to the anti-Islamic eclecticism of the _Ikhwán_.\r\n\r\nP. 375, note 2. Professor Schaeder thinks that Middle Persian\r\n_zandík_ has nothing to do with the Aramaic _zaddíq_ (_Z.D.M.G._,\r\nvol. 82, Heft 3-4, p. lxxx).\r\n\r\nPp. 383-393. During the last twenty years our knowledge of early\r\nṢúfiism has increased, chiefly through the profound researches of\r\nProfessor Massignon, to such an extent as to render the account given in\r\nthese pages altogether inadequate. The subject being one of great\r\ndifficulty and unsuitable for detailed exposition in a book of this\r\nkind, I must content myself with a few illustrative remarks and\r\nreferences, which will enable the student to obtain further information.\r\n\r\nP. 383. Massignon's view is that Ṣúfiism (down to the fourth century\r\nA.H.) owed little to foreign influences and was fundamentally Islamic, a\r\nproduct of intensive study of the Koran and of inward meditation on its\r\nmeaning and essential nature. There is great force in his argument,\r\nthough I cannot help believing that the development of mysticism, like\r\nthat of other contemporary branches of Moslem thought, must have\r\nbeen vitally affected by contact with the ancient Hellenistic\r\nculture of the Sásánian and Byzantine empires on its native\r\nsoil. Cf. A. J. Wensinck, _The Book of the Dove_ (Leyden,\r\n1919) and _Mystic Treatises by Isaac of Niniveh_ (Amsterdam,\r\n1923).\r\n\r\nP. 384, l. 1. The identity of third-century Ṣúfiism with the\r\ndoctrines of the Vedanta is maintained by M. Horten (_Indische\r\nStrömungen in der Islamischen Mystik_, Heidelberg, 1927-8). Few,\r\nhowever, would admit this. The conversion of Ṣúfiism into a\r\nmonistic philosophy was the work of Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí (1165-1240\r\nA.D.). See p. 402 foll.\r\n\r\nP. 384, l. 5. The so-called \"Theology of Aristotle,\" translated\r\nfrom Syriac into Arabic about 830 A.D., is mainly an abstract of\r\nthe _Enneads_ of Plotinus. There is an edition with German translation\r\nby Dieterici.\r\n\r\nP. 385, l. 11. All previous accounts of the development of\r\nmystical doctrines in Islam during the first three centuries after\r\nthe Hijra have been superseded by Massignon's intimate analysis\r\n(_Essai_, chs. iv and v, pp. 116-286), which includes biographies of\r\nthe eminent Ṣúfís of that period and is based upon an amazingly\r\nwide knowledge of original and mostly unpublished sources of\r\ninformation. A useful summary of these two chapters is given\r\nby Father Joseph Maréchal in his _Studies in the Psychology of the\r\nMystics_, tr. Thorold (1927), pp. 241-9.\r\n\r\nP. 386, l. 6 from foot. For Dhu ’l-Nún, see Massignon, _op. cit._,\r\np. 184 foll.\r\n\r\nP. 389, l. 12. _The Book of the Holy Hierotheos_ has recently been\r\nedited in Syriac for the first time, with English translation, by\r\nF.

See my essay on the Odes of Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ (_Studies\r\nin Islamic Mysticism_, pp. 162-266), which comprises translations\r\nof the _Khamriyya_ and three-fourths of the _Tá’iyyatu ’l-Kubrá_.\r\n\r\nP. 399, note 1. With Ḥalláj, thanks to the monumental work\r\nof Massignon (_La Passion d'al-Ḥalláj_, 2 vols., Paris, 1922), we\r\nare now better acquainted than with any other Moslem mystic.\r\nHis doctrine exhibits some remarkable affinities with Christianity\r\nand bears no traces of the pantheism attributed to him by later\r\nṢúfís as well as by Von Kremer and subsequent European writers.\r\nCf. the summary given by Father Joseph Maréchal, _op. cit._, pp.\r\n249-281, and _The Idea of Personality in Ṣúfism_ (Cambridge, 1922),\r\npp. 26-37.\r\n\r\nP. 402, l. 9. For Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí's theory of the Perfect Man,\r\nsee Tor Andrae, _Die Person Muhammeds_, p. 339 foll., and for the\r\nsame theory as expounded by ‘Abdu ’l-Karím al-Jílí († circ.\r\n1410 A.D.), a follower of Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí, in his famous treatise\r\nentitled _al-Insán al-Kámil_, cf. _Studies in Islamic Mysticism_, pp.\r\n77-142.\r\n\r\nP. 456, l. 1 foll. Here, though he is out of place in such an academic\r\ncompany, mention should have been made of Ibn Baṭṭúṭa of\r\nTangier († 1377), whose frank and entertaining story of his almost\r\nworld-wide travels, entitled _Tuḥfatu ’l-Nuẓẓár_, is described\r\nby its latest translator, Mr H. A. R. Gibb, as \"an authority for the\r\nsocial and cultural history of post-Mongol Islam.\"\r\n\r\nP. 465, last line. For a summary of the doctrines and history\r\nof the Wahhábís, see the article _Wahhābīs_ by Professor D.

Cheikho (Beyrouth,\r\n1908-10), which deals chiefly with the literature produced by the\r\nChristian Arabs of Syria, deserves mention as one of the few works on\r\nthe subject written in a European language. The influence of Western\r\nideas on Moslem theology may be studied in the _Risálatu ’l-tauḥíd_\r\nof the great Egyptian divine, Muḥammad ‘Abduh (1842-1905), which has\r\nbeen translated into French by B. Michel and Mustapha ‘Abd el Razik\r\n(Paris, 1925).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORKS BY\r\nEUROPEAN AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list is intended to give students of Arabic as well\r\nas those who cannot read that language the means of obtaining\r\nfurther information concerning the various topics which fall within\r\nthe scope of a work such as this. Since anything approaching to a\r\ncomplete bibliography is out of the question, I have mentioned only\r\na few of the most important translations from Arabic into English,\r\nFrench, German, and Latin; and I have omitted (1) monographs on\r\nparticular Arabic writers, whose names, together with the principal\r\nEuropean works relating to them, will be found in Brockelmann's\r\ngreat History of Arabic Literature, and (2) a large number of books\r\nand articles which appeal to specialists rather than to students.\r\nAdditional information is supplied by E. G. Browne in his _Literary\r\nHistory of Persia_, vol. i, pp. 481-496, and D. B. Macdonald in his\r\n_Development of Muslim Theology, etc._ (London, 1903), pp. 358-367,\r\nwhile the Appendix to H. A. R. Gibb's _Arabic Literature_ (Oxford\r\nUniversity Press, 1926) contains a well-chosen list of books of\r\nreference and translations. Those who require more detailed\r\nreferences may consult the _Bibliographie des ouvrages arabes ou\r\nrelatifs aux Arabes publ. dans l'Europe chrétienne de 1810 à 1885_,\r\nby V.
