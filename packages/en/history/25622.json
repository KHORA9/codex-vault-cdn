The State papers of Milan and Venice, of Ferrara and Modena,\r\nhave yielded up their treasures; the correspondence of Isabella d'Este,\r\nin the Gonzaga archives at Mantua, has proved a source of inexhaustible\r\nwealth and knowledge. A flood of light has been thrown on the history of\r\nItaly in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; public events and\r\npersonages have been placed in a new aspect; the judgments of posterity\r\nhave been modified and, in some instances, reversed.\r\n\r\nWe see now, more clearly than ever before, what manner of men and women\r\nthese Estes and Gonzagas, these Sforzas and Viscontis, were. We gain\r\nfresh insight into their characters and aims, their secret motives and\r\nprivate wishes. We see them in their daily occupations and amusements,\r\nat their work and at their play. We follow them from the battle-field\r\nand council chamber, from the chase and tournament, to the privacy of\r\ndomestic life and the intimate scenes of the family circle. And we\r\nrealize how, in spite of the tragic stories or bloodshed and strife that\r\ndarkened their lives, in spite, too, of the low standard of morals and\r\nof the crimes and vices that we are accustomed to associate with\r\nRenaissance princes, there was a rare measure of beauty and goodness, of\r\nculture and refinement, of love of justice and zeal for truth, among\r\nthem. As the latest historian of the Papacy, Dr. Pastor, has wisely\r\nremarked, we must take care not to paint the state of morals during the\r\nItalian Renaissance blacker than it really was. Virtue goes quietly on\r\nher way, while vice is noisy and uproarious; the criminal forces\r\nhimself upon the public attention, while the honest man does his duty in\r\nsilence, and no one hears of him. This is especially the case with the\r\nwomen of the Renaissance. They had their faults and their weaknesses,\r\nbut the great majority among them led pure and irreproachable lives, and\r\ntrained their children in the paths of truth and duty. Even Lucrezia\r\nBorgia, although she may not have been altogether immaculate, was not\r\nthe foul creature that we once believed. And the more closely we study\r\nthese newly discovered documents, the more we become convinced that this\r\nage produced some of the most admirable types of womanhood that the\r\nworld has ever seen. When Castiglione painted his ideal woman in the\r\npages of the \"Cortigiano,\" he had no need to draw on his imagination.\r\nElizabeth Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, and Isabella d'Este, Marchioness\r\nof Mantua, were both of them women of great intellect and stainless\r\nvirtue, whose genuine love of art and letters attracted the choicest\r\nspirits to their court, and exerted the most beneficial influence on the\r\nthought of the day. Isabella, whose vast correspondence with the\r\nforemost painters and scholars of the age has been preserved almost\r\nintact, was probably the most remarkable lady of the Renaissance. The\r\nstory of her long and eventful life--a theme of absorbing interest--yet\r\nremains to be written. The present work is devoted to the history of her\r\nyounger sister, Beatrice, Duchess of Milan, who, as the wife of Lodovico\r\nSforza, reigned during six years over the most splendid court of Italy.\r\nThe charm of her personality, the important part which she played in\r\npolitical life at a critical moment of Italian history, her love of\r\nmusic and poetry, and the fine taste which she inherited, in common with\r\nevery princess of the house of Este, all help to make Beatrice\r\nsingularly attractive, while the interest which she inspires is deepened\r\nby the pathos of her sudden and early death.\r\n\r\nIf in Isabella we have the supreme representative of Renaissance culture\r\nin its highest and most intellectual phase, Beatrice is the type of that\r\nnew-found joy in life, that intoxicating rapture in the actual sense of\r\nexistence, that was the heritage of her generation, and found\r\nexpression in the words of a contemporary novelist, Matteo\r\nBandello--himself of Lombard birth--when with his last breath he bade\r\nhis companions live joyously, \"_Vivete lieti!_\" We see this bride of\r\nsixteen summers flinging herself with passionate delight into every\r\namusement, singing gay songs with her courtiers, dancing and hunting\r\nthrough the livelong day, outstripping all her companions in the chase,\r\nand laughing in the face of danger. We see her holding her court in the\r\nfamous Castello of Porta Giovia or in the summer palaces of Vigevano and\r\nCussago, in these golden days when Milan was called the new Athens, when\r\nLeonardo and Bramante decorated palaces or arranged masquerades at the\r\nduke's bidding, when Gaspare Visconti wrote sonnets in illuminated\r\nbooks, and Lorenzo da Pavia constructed organs or viols as perfect and\r\nbeautiful to see as to hear, for the pleasure of the youthful duchess.\r\nScholars and poets, painters and writers, gallant soldiers and\r\naccomplished cavaliers, we see them all at Beatrice's feet, striving how\r\nbest they may gratify her fancies and win her smiles. Young and old,\r\nthey were alike devoted to her service, from Galeazzo di Sanseverino,\r\nthe valiant captain who became her willing slave and chosen companion,\r\nto Niccolo da Correggio, that all-accomplished gentleman who laid down\r\nhis pen and sword to design elaborate devices for his mistress's new\r\ngowns. We read her merry letters to her husband and sister, letters\r\nsparkling with wit and gaiety and overflowing with simple and natural\r\naffection. We see her rejoicing with all a young mother's proud delight\r\nover her first-born son, repeating, as mothers will, marvellous tales of\r\nhis size and growth, and framing tender phrases for his infant lips. And\r\nwe catch glimpses of her, too, in sadder moods, mourning her mother's\r\nloss or wounded by neglect and unkindness. We note how keenly her proud\r\nspirit resents wrong and injustice, and how in her turn she is not\r\nalways careful of the rights and feelings of her rivals. But whatever\r\nher faults and mistakes may have been, she is always kindly and\r\ngenerous, human and lovable. A year or two passes, and we see her,\r\nroyally arrayed in brocade and jewels, standing up in the great council\r\nhall of Venice, to plead her husband's cause before the Doge and\r\nSenate. Later on we find her sharing her lord's counsels in court and\r\ncamp, receiving king and emperor at Pavia or Vigevano, fascinating the\r\nsusceptible heart of Charles VIII. by her charms, and amazing Kaiser\r\nMaximilian by her wisdom and judgment in affairs of state. And then\r\nsuddenly the music and dancing, the feasting and travelling, cease, and\r\nthe richly coloured and animated pageant is brought to an abrupt close.\r\nBeatrice dies, without a moment's warning, in the flower of youth and\r\nbeauty, and the young duchess is borne to her grave in S. Maria delle\r\nGrazie amid the tears and lamentations of all Milan. And with her death,\r\nthe whole Milanese state, that fabric which Lodovico Sforza had built up\r\nat such infinite cost and pains, crumbles into ruin. Fortune, which till\r\nthat hour had smiled so kindly on the Moro and had raised him to giddy\r\nheights of prosperity, now turned her back upon him. In three short\r\nyears he had lost everything--crown, home, and liberty--and was left to\r\ndrag out a miserable existence in the dungeons of Berry and Touraine.\r\n\r\n\"And when Duchess Beatrice died,\" wrote the poet, Vincenzo Calmeta,\r\n\"everything fell into ruin, and that court, which had been a joyous\r\nparadise, was changed into a black Inferno.\"\r\n\r\nThen Milan and her people become a prey to the rude outrages of French\r\nsoldiery. Leonardo's great horse was broken in pieces by Gascon archers,\r\nand the Castello, \"which had once held the finest flower of the whole\r\nworld, became,\" in Castiglione's words, \"a place of drinking-booths and\r\ndung-hills.\" The treasures of art and beauty stored up within its walls\r\nwere destroyed by barbarous hands, and all that brilliant company was\r\ndispersed and scattered abroad. Artists and poets, knights and\r\nscholars--Leonardo and Bramante, Galeazzo and Niccolo--were driven out,\r\nand went their way each in a different direction, to seek new homes and\r\nother patrons. But the memory of the young duchess--the _Donna beata_ of\r\nPistoja and Visconti's song--lived for many a year in the hearts of her\r\nloyal servants, Castiglione enshrined her name in his immortal pages,\r\nAriosto celebrated her virtues in the cantos of his \"Orlando Furioso,\"\r\nand far on in the new century, grey-headed scholars spoke of her as\r\n\"_la più zentil Donna d'Italia_\"--the sweetest lady in all Italy.\r\n\r\nAnd to-day, as we pace the dim aisles of the great Certosa, we may look\r\non the marble effigy of Duchess Beatrice and see the lovely face with\r\nthe curling locks and child-like features which the Lombard sculptor\r\ncarved, and which still bears witness to the love of Lodovico Sforza for\r\nhis young wife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I must acknowledge how deeply I am indebted to Signor\r\nLuzio, keeper of the Gonzaga archives at Mantua, and to his able\r\ncolleague, Signor Renier, for the assistance which they have lent to my\r\nresearches, as well as for the help afforded by their own publications,\r\nin which many of Isabella and Beatrice d'Este's most interesting letters\r\nhave already been given to the world.

All\r\nthe great story of the past, all the romance of medieval chivalry, seems\r\nto live again in that picturesque, irregular pile with the crenellated\r\ntowers and dusky red-brick walls, overhanging the sleepy waters of the\r\nancient moat. The song of Boiardo and Ariosto still lingers in the air\r\nabout the ruddy pinnacles; the spacious courts and broad piazza recall\r\nthe tournaments and pageants of olden time. Once more the sound of\r\nclanging trumpets or merry hunting-horn awakes the echoes, as the joyous\r\ntrain of lords and ladies sweep out through the castle gates in the\r\nsummer morning; once more, under vaulted loggias and high-arched\r\nbalconies, we see the courtly scholar bending earnestly over some\r\nclassic page, or catch the voice of high-born maiden singing Petrarch's\r\nsonnets to her lute.\r\n\r\nSt. George was the champion of Ferrara and the patron saint of the house\r\nof Este. There year by year his festival was celebrated with great\r\nrejoicings, and vast crowds thronged the piazza before the Castello to\r\nsee the famous races for the _pallium_. It is St. George who rides full\r\ntilt at the dragon in the rude sculptures on the portal of the\r\nRomanesque Cathedral hard by; it is the same warrior-saint who, in his\r\ngleaming armour, looks down from the painted fresco above the portcullis\r\nof the castle drawbridge. And all the masters who worked for the Este\r\ndukes, whether they were men of native or foreign birth--Vittore\r\nPisanello and Jacopo Bellini, Cosimo Tura and Dosso Dossi--took delight\r\nin the old story, and painted the legend of St. George and Princess\r\nSabra in the frescoes or altar-pieces with which they adorned the\r\nchurches and castle halls.\r\n\r\nThe Estes, who took St. George for their patron, and fought and died\r\nunder his banner, were themselves a chivalrous and splendour-loving\r\nrace, ever ready to ride out in quest of fresh adventure in the chase or\r\nbattle-field. Men and women alike were renowned, even among the princely\r\nhouses of Italy in Renaissance time, for their rare culture and genuine\r\nlove of art and letters. And they were justly proud of their ancient\r\nlineage and of the love and loyalty which their subjects bore them. The\r\nSforzas of Milan, the Medici of Florence, the Riarios or the Della\r\nRoveres, were but low-born upstarts by the side of this illustrious race\r\nwhich had reigned on the banks of the Po during the last two hundred\r\nyears. In spite of wars and bloodshed, in spite of occasional\r\nconspiracies and tumults, chiefly stirred up by members of the reigning\r\nfamily, the people of Ferrara loved their rulers well, and never showed\r\nany wish to change the house of Este for another. The citizens took a\r\npersonal interest in their own duke and duchess and in all that belonged\r\nto them, and chronicled their doings with minute attention. They shared\r\ntheir sorrows and rejoiced in their joys, they lamented their departure\r\nand hailed their return with acclamation, they followed the fortunes of\r\ntheir children with keen interest, and welcomed the return of the\r\nyouthful bride with acclamations, or wept bitter tears over her untimely\r\nend.\r\n\r\nOf all the Estes who held sway at Ferrara, the most illustrious and most\r\nbeloved was Duke Ercole I., the father of Beatrice. During the\r\nthirty-four years that he reigned in Ferrara, the duchy enjoyed a degree\r\nof material prosperity which it had never attained before, and rose to\r\nthe foremost rank among the states of North Italy. And in the troubled\r\ntimes of the next century, his people looked back on the days of Duke\r\nErcole and his good duchess as the golden age of Ferrara. After the\r\ndeath of his father, the able and learned Niccolo III., who first\r\nestablished his throne on sure and safe foundations, Ercole's two elder\r\nhalf-brothers, Leonello and Borso, reigned in succession over Ferrara,\r\nand kept up the proud traditions of the house of Este, both in war and\r\npeace. Both were bastards, but in the Este family this was never held to\r\nbe a bar to the succession. \"In Italy,\" as Commines wrote, \"they make\r\nlittle difference between legitimate and illegitimate children.\" But\r\nwhen the last of the two, Duke Borso, died on the 27th of May, 1471, of\r\nmalarial fever caught on his journey to Rome, to receive the investiture\r\nof his duchy from the Pope, Niccolo's eldest legitimate son Ercole\r\nsuccessfully asserted his claim to the throne, and entered peacefully\r\nupon his heritage. Two years later, the next duke, who was already\r\nthirty-eight years of age, obtained the hand of Leonora of Aragon,\r\ndaughter of Ferrante, King of Naples, and sent his brother Sigismondo at\r\nthe head of a splendid retinue to bring home his royal bride. After a\r\nvisit to Rome, where Pope Sixtus IV. entertained her at a series of\r\nmagnificent banquets and theatrical representations, the young duchess\r\nentered Ferrara in state. On a bright June morning she rode through the\r\nstreets in a robe glittering with jewels, with a stately canopy over her\r\nhead and a gold crown on her flowing hair. Latin orations, orchestral\r\nmusic, and theatrical displays, for which Ferrara was already famous,\r\ngreeted the bridal procession at every point. The houses were hung with\r\ntapestries and cloth of gold, avenues of flowering shrubs were planted\r\nalong the broad white streets, and ringing shouts greeted the coming of\r\nthe fair princess who was to make her home in Ferrara. The happy event\r\nwas commemorated by a noble medal, designed by the Mantuan Sperandio,\r\nthe most illustrious of a school of medallists employed at Ferrara in\r\nDuke Borso's time, while Leonora's refined features and expressive face\r\nare preserved in a well-known bas-relief, now in Paris. Ercole and his\r\nbride took up their abode in the Este palace, a stately Renaissance\r\nstructure opposite the old Lombard Duomo, a few steps from the Castello,\r\nwith which it was connected by a covered passage.\r\n\r\nThe charm and goodness of the young duchess soon won the heart of her\r\nsubjects. From the first she entered eagerly into Ercole's schemes for\r\nordering his capital and encouraging art, and brought a new and gentler\r\ninfluence to bear on the society of her husband's court. There, too, she\r\nfound a congenial spirit in the duke's accomplished sister, Bianca, that\r\nVirgin of Este, who was the subject of Tito Strozzi's impassioned\r\neulogy, and whose Latin and Greek prose excited the admiration of all\r\nher contemporaries. This cultivated princess had been originally\r\nbetrothed to the eldest son of Federigo, Duke of Urbino, but his early\r\ndeath put an end to these hopes, and in 1468 she married Galeotto della\r\nMirandola, a prince of the house of Carpi, who lived, at Ferrara some\r\nyears, and afterwards entered the service of Lodovico Sforza and served\r\nas captain in his wars.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, 1474, the duchess gave birth to a daughter, who\r\nreceived the name of Isabella, always a favourite in the house of\r\nAragon, and was destined to become the most celebrated lady of the\r\nRenaissance. A year later, on the 29th of June, 1475, a second daughter\r\nsaw the light. Her appearance, however, proved no cause of rejoicing, as\r\nwe learn from the contemporary chronicle published by Muratori--\r\n\r\n\"A daughter was born this day to Duke Ercole, and received the name of\r\nBeatrice, being the child of Madonna Leonora his wife. And there were no\r\nrejoicings, because every one wished for a boy.\"\r\n\r\nNo one in Ferrara then dreamt that the babe who received so cold a\r\nwelcome would one day reign over the Milanese, as the wife of Lodovico\r\nSforza, the most powerful of Italian princes, and would herself be\r\nremembered by posterity as \"la più zentil donna in Italia\"--the sweetest\r\nlady in all Italy. At least the name bestowed upon her was a good omen.\r\nShe was called Beatrice after two favourite relatives of her parents.\r\nOne of these was Leonora's only sister, Beatrice of Aragon, who in that\r\nsame year passed through Ferrara on her way to join her husband,\r\nMatthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, and whose presence, we are told by\r\nthe diarist, gave great pleasure to both duke and duchess. The other\r\nBeatrice was Ercole's half-sister, the elder daughter of Niccolo III.,\r\nwho had long been the ornament of her father's court, when she had been\r\nknown as the Queen of Feasts, and it had become a common proverb that to\r\nsee Madonna Beatrice dance was to find Paradise upon earth. In 1448, at\r\nthe age of twenty-one, this brilliant lady had wedded Borso da\r\nCorreggio, a brother of the reigning prince of that city, and, after her\r\nfirst husband's early death, had become the wife of Tristan Sforza, an\r\nillegitimate son of the great Condottiere Francesco Sforza, Duke of\r\nMilan. Although her home was now in Lombardy, Beatrice d'Este remained\r\non intimate terms with her own family, and her son Niccolo da Correggio\r\nwas known as the handsomest and most accomplished cavalier at the court\r\nof Ferrara. He had accompanied his uncle Duke Borso on his journey to\r\nRome, and had been one of the escort sent to conduct Duchess Leonora\r\nfrom Naples.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year following Beatrice's birth, the hopes of the\r\nloyal Ferrarese were at length fulfilled, and a son was born to the duke\r\nand duchess on the 21st of July, 1476. This time the citizens abandoned\r\nthemselves to demonstrations of enthusiastic delight. The bells were\r\nrung and the shops closed during three whole days, and the child was\r\nbaptized with great pomp in the Chapel of the Vescovado, close to the\r\nDuomo. The infant received the name of Alfonso, after his grandfather,\r\nthe great King of Naples, and a \"beautiful fête,\" to quote one\r\nchronicler's words, \"was held in honour of the auspicious event in the\r\nSala Grande of the Schifanoia Villa.\" On this occasion a concert was\r\ngiven by a hundred trumpeters, pipers, and tambourine-players in the\r\nfrescoed hall of this favourite summer palace, and a sumptuous banquet\r\nwas prepared after the fashion of the times, with an immense number of\r\n_confetti_, representing lords and ladies, animals, trees, and castles,\r\nall made of gilt and coloured sugar, which our friend the diarist tells\r\nus were carried off or eaten by the people as soon as the doors were\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nBut a few days afterwards, while Duke Ercole was away from Ferrara, his\r\nwife was surprised by a sudden rising, the result of a deep-laid\r\nconspiracy, secretly planned by his nephew, Niccolo, a bastard son of\r\nLeonello d'Este. Niccolo's first endeavour was to seize on the person of\r\nthe duchess and her young children, an attempt which almost proved\r\nsuccessful, but was fortunately defeated by Leonora's own courage and\r\npresence of mind. The palace was already surrounded by armed men, when\r\nthe alarm reached the ears of the duchess, and, springing out of bed\r\nwith her infant son in her arms, followed by her two little daughters\r\nand a few faithful servants, she fled by the covered way to the\r\nCastello. Hardly had she left her room, when the conspirators rushed in\r\nand sacked the palace, killing all who tried to offer resistance. The\r\npeople of Ferrara, however, were loyal to their beloved duke and\r\nduchess. After a few days of anxious suspense, Ercole returned, and soon\r\nquelled the tumult and restored order in the city. That evening he\r\nappeared on the balcony of the Castello, and publicly embraced his wife\r\nand children amid the shouts and applause of the whole city. The next\r\nday the whole ducal family went in solemn procession to the Cathedral,\r\nand there gave public thanks for their marvellous deliverance. A\r\nterrible list of cruel reprisals followed upon this rebellion, and\r\nNiccolo d'Este himself, with two hundred of his partisans, were put to\r\ndeath after the bloody fashion of the times.\r\n\r\nA year later, when the danger was over and tranquillity had been\r\ncompletely restored, Leonora and her two little daughters set out for\r\nNaples, under the escort of Niccolo da Correggio, to be present at her\r\nfather King Ferrante's second marriage with the young Princess Joan of\r\nAragon, a sister of Ferdinand the Catholic. The duchess and her children\r\ntravelled by land to Pisa, where galleys were waiting to conduct them to\r\nNaples, and reached her father's court on the 1st of June, 1477. Here\r\nLeonora spent the next four months, and in September, gave birth to a\r\nsecond son, who was named Ferrante, after his royal grandfather. But\r\nsoon news reached Naples that war had broken out in Northern Italy, and\r\nthat Duke Ercole had been chosen Captain-general of the Florentine\r\narmies. In his absence the presence of the duchess was absolutely\r\nnecessary at Ferrara, and early in November Leonora left Naples and\r\nhastened home to take up the reins of government and administer the\r\nstate in her lord's stead. She took her elder daughter Isabella with\r\nher, but left her new-born son at Naples, together with his little\r\nsister Beatrice, from whom the old King Ferrante refused to part. This\r\nbright-eyed child, who had won her grandfather's affections at this\r\nearly age, remained at Naples for the next eight years, and grew up in\r\nthe royal palace on the terraced steps of that enchanted shore, where\r\neven then Sannazzaro was dreaming of Arcadia, and where Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici loved to talk over books and poetry with his learned friend the\r\nDuchess Ippolita. Beatrice was too young to realize the rare degree of\r\nculture which had made Alfonso's and Ferrante's court the favourite\r\nabode of the Greek and Latin scholars of the age, too innocent to be\r\naware of the dark deeds which threw a shadow over these sunny regions,\r\nwhere the strange medley of luxury and vice, of refinement and cruelty,\r\nrecalled the days of Imperial Rome. But the balmy breath of these\r\nSouthern climes, the soft luxuriant spell of blue seas and groves of\r\npalm and cassia, sank deep into the child's being, and something of the\r\nfire and passion, the mirth and gaiety, of the dwellers in this\r\ndelicious land passed into her soul, and helped to mould her nature\r\nduring these years that she spent far from mother and sister at King\r\nFerrante's court.\r\n\r\nIn these early days many personages with whom she was to be closely\r\nassociated in after-years were living at Naples. There were scholars and\r\npoets whom she was to meet again in Milan at her husband's court, and\r\nwho would be glad to remind her that they had known her as a child in\r\nher grandfather's palace. There was Pontano, the founder of the Academy\r\nof Naples, who was busy writing his Latin eclogues on the myrtle bowers\r\nof Baiae and the orange groves of Sorrento. There was her aunt, the\r\naccomplished Ippolita Sforza, Duchess of Calabria, who had learnt Greek\r\nof the great teacher Lascaris in her young days at Milan, and whose\r\nwedding had brought the magnificent Lorenzo to the court of the Sforzas.\r\nAnd for playmates the little Beatrice had Ippolita's children: the boy\r\nFerrante, whose chivalrous nature endeared him to his Este cousins, even\r\nwhen their husbands joined with the French invaders to drive him from\r\nhis father's throne; and the girl Isabella, who was already affianced to\r\nthe young Duke Giangaleazzo, who was in future years to become her\r\ncompanion and rival at the court of Milan. Here, too, in the summer of\r\n1479, came a new visitor in the shape of Duchess Ippolita's brother,\r\nLodovico Sforza, surnamed _Il Moro_, himself the younger son of the\r\ngreat Duke Francesco. On his elder brother Sforza's death, the King of\r\nNaples had invested him with the duchy of Bari, and now he promised him\r\nmen and money with which to assert his claims against his sister-in-law,\r\nthe widowed Duchess Bona and the minions who had driven him and his\r\nbrothers out of their native land. In June, 1477, only a few days after\r\nLeonora and her children left Ferrara, the exiled prince had arrived\r\nthere on his way to Pisa, and had been courteously entertained by Duke\r\nErcole in the Schifanoia Palace. Since then he had spent two dreary\r\nyears in exile at Pisa, fretting out his heart in his enforced idleness,\r\nand pining for the hour of release. That hour was now at hand. Before\r\nthe end of the year, Lodovico Sforza had, by a succession of bold\r\nmanoeuvres, driven out his rivals and was virtually supreme in Milan.\r\nThe first step which the new regent took was to ally himself with the\r\nDuke of Ferrara. The houses of Sforza and Este had always been on\r\nfriendly terms, and Ercole's father Niccolo had presented Francesco\r\nSforza with a famous diamond in acknowledgment of the services rendered\r\nhim by the great Condottiere. When Francesco's son and successor, Duke\r\nGaleazzo Maria, was murdered in 1476, his widow, Duchess Bona, had\r\nrenewed the old alliance with Ferrara, and a marriage had been arranged\r\nbetween her infant daughter Anna Sforza and Duke Ercole's new-born son\r\nand heir Alfonso. In May, 1477, this betrothal was proclaimed in Milan,\r\nand a fortnight later the nuptial contract was signed at Ferrara. The\r\nunion of the two houses was celebrated by solemn processions and\r\nthanksgivings throughout the duchy, and the infant bridegroom was\r\ncarried in the arms of his chamberlain to meet the Milanese ambassador,\r\nwho appeared on behalf of the little three-year-old bride. Seven years\r\nafterwards, Duchess Leonora sent a magnificent doll with a trousseau of\r\nclothes designed by the best artists in Ferrara, as a gift to the little\r\ndaughter-in-law whom she had not yet seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1480, Lodovico Sforza formally asked Ercole to give him the hand of\r\nhis elder daughter Isabella, then a child of six. Lodovico himself was\r\ntwenty-nine, and besides being a man of remarkable abilities and\r\nsingularly handsome presence, had the reputation of being the richest\r\nprince in Italy. Duke Ercole further saw the great importance of\r\nstrengthening the alliance with Milan at a time when Ferrara was again\r\nthreatened by her hereditary enemies, the Pope and Venice.\r\nUnfortunately, his youthful daughter had already been sought in marriage\r\nby Federico, Marquis of Mantua, on behalf of his elder son, Giovanni\r\nFrancesco; and Ercole, unwilling to offend so near a neighbour, and yet\r\nreluctant to lose the chance of a second desirable alliance, offered\r\nLodovico Sforza the hand of his younger daughter, Beatrice. The Duke of\r\nBari made no objection to this arrangement, and on St. George's Day,\r\nErcole addressed the following letter to his old ally, Marquis\r\nFederico:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LORD AND DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n\"This is to inform you that the most illustrious Madonna Duchess of\r\nMilan and His Illustrious Highness Lodovico Sforza have sent their\r\nambassador, M. Gabriele Tassino, to ask for our daughter Madonna\r\nIsabella on behalf of Signor Lodovico. We have replied that to our\r\nregret this marriage was no longer possible, since we had already\r\nentered into negotiations on the subject with your Highness and your\r\neldest son. But since we have another daughter at Naples, who is only\r\nabout a year younger, and who has been adopted by his Majesty the King\r\nof Naples as his own child, we have written to acquaint His Serene\r\nMajesty with the wish of these illustrious Persons, and have asked him\r\nif he will consent to accept the said Signor Lodovico as his kinsman,\r\nsince without his leave we were unable to dispose of our daughter\r\nBeatrice's hand. The said Persons having expressed themselves as well\r\ncontent with the proceeding, out of respect for the King's Majesty he\r\nhas now declared his approval of this marriage, to which we have\r\naccordingly signified our consent. We are sure that you will rejoice\r\nwith us, seeing the close union and alliance that has long existed\r\nbetween us, and beg your Illustrious Highness to keep the matter secret\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\n                                         \"HERCULES, DUX FERR., ETC.[1]\r\n\r\n_Ferrara, 23rd April, 1480._\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to reflect on the possible changes in the course of\r\nevents in Italian history during the next thirty years, if Lodovico\r\nSforza's proposals had reached Ferrara a few months earlier, and\r\nIsabella d'Este, instead of her sister Beatrice, had become his wife.\r\nWould the rare prudence and self-control of the elder princess have led\r\nher to play a different part in the difficult circumstances which\r\nsurrounded her position at the court of Milan as the Moro's wife? Would\r\nIsabella's calmer temperament and wise and far-seeing intellect have\r\nbeen able to restrain Lodovico's ambitious dreams and avert his ruin?\r\nThe cordial relations that were afterwards to exist between Lodovico and\r\nhis gifted sister-in-law, the Moro's keen appreciation of Isabella's\r\ncharacter, incline us to believe that she would have acquired great\r\ninfluence over her lord; and that so remarkable a woman would have\r\nplayed a very important part on this larger stage. But the Fates had\r\nwilled otherwise, and Beatrice d'Este became the bride of Lodovico\r\nSforza. Her royal grandfather, old King Ferrante, gave his sanction to\r\nthe proposed marriage, although he refused to part from his little\r\ngrandchild at present, and when, five years later, Beatrice returned to\r\nFerrara, she assumed the title and estate of Duchess of Bari, and was\r\npublicly recognized as Lodovico's promised wife. She had by this time\r\nreached the age of ten, and her espoused husband was exactly\r\nthirty-four.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Luzio-Renier in Archivio Storico Lombardo, xvii. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLodovico Sforza--Known as Il Moro--His birth and childhood--Murder of\r\nDuke Galeazzo Maria--Regency of Duchess Bona--Exile of the Sforza\r\nbrothers--Lodovico at Pisa--His invasion of Lombardy and return to Milan\r\n--Death of Cecco Simonetta--Flight of Duchess Bona--Lodovico Regent of\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\n1451-1582\r\n\r\n\r\nLodovico Sforza was certainly one of the most remarkable figures of the\r\nItalian Renaissance. He has generally been described as one of the\r\nblackest. \"Born for the ruin of Italy,\" was the verdict of his\r\ncontemporary Paolo Giovio, a verdict which every chronicler of the\r\nsixteenth century has endorsed. These men who saw the disasters which\r\noverwhelmed their country under the foreign rule, could not forget that\r\nCharles VIII., the first French king who invaded Italy, had crossed the\r\nAlps as the friend and ally of Lodovico Moro. They forgot how many\r\nothers were at least equally guilty, and did not realize the vast\r\nnetwork of intrigues in which Pope Julius II., the Venetian Signory, and\r\nthe King of Naples all had a share. Later historians with one consent\r\nhave accepted Paolo Giovio's view, and have made Lodovico responsible\r\nfor all the miseries which arose from the French invasion. The bitter\r\nhatred with which both French and Venetian writers regarded the prince\r\nwho had foiled their countrymen and profited by their mistakes, has\r\nhelped to deepen this sinister impression. The greatest crimes were\r\nimputed to him, the vilest calumnies concerning his personal character\r\nfound ready acceptance. But the more impartial judgment of modern\r\nhistorians, together with the light thrown upon the subject by recently\r\ndiscovered documents, has done much to modify our opinion of Lodovico's\r\ncharacter. The worst charges formerly brought against him, above all,\r\nthe alleged poisoning of his nephew, the reigning Duke of Milan, have\r\nbeen dismissed as groundless and wholly alien to his nature and\r\ncharacter. On the other hand, his great merits and rare talents as ruler\r\nand administrator have been fully recognized, while it is admitted on\r\nall hands that his generous and enlightened encouragement of art and\r\nletters entitles him to a place among the most illustrious patrons of\r\nthe Renaissance. To his keen intellect and discerning eye, to his fine\r\ntaste and quick sympathy with all forms of beauty, we owe the production\r\nof some of the noblest works of art that human hands have ever\r\nfashioned. To his personal encouragement and magnificent liberality we\r\nowe the grandest monuments of Lombard architecture, and the finest\r\ndevelopment of Milanese painting, the façade of the Certosa and the\r\ncupola of Sta. Maria delle Grazie, the frescoes and altar-pieces of the\r\nBrera and the Ambrosiana. Above all, it was at the Milanese court, under\r\nthe stimulating influence of the Moro, that Leonardo da Vinci's finest\r\nwork was done.\r\n\r\nAs a man, Lodovico Sforza is profoundly interesting. Burckhardt has\r\ncalled him the most complete among the princely figures of the Italian\r\nRenaissance, and there can be no doubt that alike in his virtues and in\r\nhis faults, he was curiously typical of the age in which he lived.\r\nGuicciardini, who was certainly no friend to him, and regarded him as\r\nthe inveterate foe of Florence, describes him as \"a creature of very\r\nrare perfection, most excellent for his eloquence and industry and many\r\ngifts of nature and spirit, and not unworthy of the name of milde and\r\nmercifull;\" and the Milanese doctor Arluno, the author of an unpublished\r\nchronicle in the Biblioteca Marciana at Venice, says, \"He had a sublime\r\nsoul and universal capacity. Whatever he did, he surpassed expectation,\r\nin the fine arts and learning, in justice and benevolence. And he had no\r\nequal among Italian princes for wisdom and sagacity in public affairs.\"\r\nContemporary writers describe him as very pleasant in manner and\r\ngracious in speech, always gentle and courteous to others, ready to\r\nlisten, and never losing his temper in argument. He shared in the\r\nlaxity of morals common to his age; but was a man of deep affections as\r\nwell as strong passions, fondly attached to his children and friends,\r\nwhile the profound and lasting grief with which he lamented his dead\r\nwife amazed his more fickle contemporaries. Singularly refined and\r\nsensitive by nature, he shrank instinctively from bloodshed, and had a\r\nhorror of all violent actions. In this he differed greatly from his\r\nelder brother Galeazzo Maria, who was a monster of lust and cruelty,\r\nintent only on gratifying his savage instincts, and as callous to human\r\nsuffering as he was reckless of human life. Lodovico, as his most\r\nhostile critics agree, was emphatically not a cruel man, and rarely\r\nconsented to condemn even criminals to death. But, like many other\r\npoliticians who have great ends in view, he was often unscrupulous as to\r\nthe means which he employed, and, as Burckhardt very truly remarked,\r\nwould probably have been surprised at being held responsible for the\r\nmeans by which he attained his object. Trained from early youth in the\r\nmost tortuous paths of Italian diplomacy, he acted on the principle laid\r\ndown by the Venetian Marino Sanuto, that the first duty of the really\r\nwise statesman is to persuade his enemies that he means to do one thing\r\nand then do another. But in these tangled paths he often over-reached\r\nhimself, and only succeeded in inspiring all parties with distrust; and,\r\nas too often happens, this deceiver was deceived in his turn, and in the\r\nend betrayed by men in whom his whole trust had been placed. Another\r\ncurious feature of Lodovico's character was the strain of moral\r\ncowardice which, in spite of great personal bravery, marked his public\r\nactions at the most critical moments. This sudden failure of courage, or\r\nloss of nerve, that to his contemporaries seemed little short of\r\nmadness, absolutely inexplicable in a man who had faced death without a\r\nthought on many a battle-field, ultimately wrought his own downfall as\r\nwell as that of his State.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of all his faults and failings, in spite of the\r\nstrange tissue of complex aims and motives which swayed his course,\r\nLodovico Sforza was a man of great ideas and splendid capacities, a\r\nprince who was in many respects distinctly in advance of his age. His\r\nwise and beneficial schemes for the encouragement of agriculture and the\r\ngood of his poorer subjects, his careful regulations for the\r\nadministration of the University and advancement of all branches of\r\nlearning, his extraordinary industry and minute attention to detail,\r\ncannot fail to inspire our interest and command our admiration. In more\r\npeaceful times and under happier circumstances he would have been an\r\nexcellent ruler, and his great dream of a united kingdom of North Italy\r\nmight have been well and nobly realized. As it was, the history of\r\nLodovico Moro belongs to the saddest tragedies of the Renaissance, and\r\nthe splendour of his prosperity and the greatness of his fall became the\r\ncommon theme of poet and moralist.\r\n\r\nThe story of Lodovico's childhood is one of the pleasantest parts of his\r\nstrangely chequered career. He was the fourth son of Francesco Sforza,\r\nthe famous soldier of fortune who had married Madonna Bianca, daughter\r\nof the last Visconti, and reigned in right of his wife as Duke of Milan\r\nduring twenty years. On the 19th of August, 1451, a year and a half\r\nafter the great captain had boldly entered Milan and been proclaimed\r\nDuke, Duchess Bianca gave birth at her summer palace of Vigevano to a\r\nfine boy. This \"_bel puello_,\" as he is called in the despatch\r\nannouncing the news to his proud father, received the name of Lodovico\r\nMauro, which was afterwards altered to Lodovico Maria, when, after his\r\nrecovery from a dangerous illness at five years old, his mother placed\r\nhim under the special protection of the Blessed Virgin. On this occasion\r\nBianca vowed rich offerings to the shrine of Il Santo at Padua, and in\r\ndischarge of this vow, her faithful servant Giovanni Francesco Stanga of\r\nCremona was sent to Padua in February, 1461, to present a life-size\r\nimage of the boy richly worked in silver, together with a complete set\r\nof vestments and of altar plate bearing the ducal arms, to the ark of\r\nthe blessed Anthony. In documents still preserved in the Paduan archives\r\nthe boy is twice over mentioned as _Lodovicus Maurus filius quartus\r\nmasculus_, but the silver image itself bore the inscription, \"_Pro\r\nsanitate filii_. Lodovici Mariæ, 1461.\"[2] There can, however, be little\r\ndoubt that Maurus was the second name first given to Lodovico, and that\r\nthis was the true origin of the surname _Il Moro_ by which Francesco\r\nSforza's son became famous in after-years. The most ingenious\r\nexplanations of this name have been invented by Italian chroniclers.\r\nPrato and Lomazzo both say that Lodovico was called Il Moro because of\r\nthe darkness of his complexion and long black hair. Guicciardini repeats\r\nthe same, but Paolo Giovio, who had seen Lodovico at Como, asserts that\r\nhis complexion was fair, and he owed this surname to the mulberry-tree\r\nwhich he adopted as his device, because it waits till the winter is well\r\nover to put forth its leaves, and is therefore called the most prudent\r\nof all trees. As a matter of fact, there is no doubt that the surname\r\nwas given to Lodovico by his parents. \"He was first called Moro by his\r\nfather Francesco and his mother Bianca in his earliest years,\" writes\r\nPrato, and we find the same expression in the verse of a Milanese court\r\npoet: \"_Et Maurum læto patris cognomine dictum_.\" The name naturally\r\nprovoked puns. The dark-eyed boy with his long black hair and bushy\r\neyebrows went by the nickname of Moro, and as he grew up, adopted both\r\nthe Moor's head and the mulberry-tree as his badge. These devices in\r\ntheir turn supplied the poets and painters of his court with themes on\r\nwhich they were never tired of exercising their wit and ingenuity. Moors\r\nand Moorish costumes were introduced in every masquerade and ballet, a\r\nMoorish page was represented brushing the robes of Italy in a fresco of\r\nthe Castello of Milan, while mulberry colour became fashionable among\r\nthe ladies of the Moro's court, and was commonly worn by the servants\r\nand pages in the palace. Lodovico early gave signs of the love of\r\nliterature and the great abilities which distinguished him in\r\nafter-life. His quickness in learning by heart, his extraordinary\r\nmemory, and the fluency with which he wrote and spoke Latin amazed his\r\ntutors. And he was fortunate in receiving an excellent education from\r\nthe first Greek scholars of the day. Madonna Bianca, the only daughter\r\nof Filippo Maria, the last Visconti who had betrothed her before she was\r\neight years old to Francesco Sforza, proved herself the best of wives\r\nand mothers. By her courage and wisdom she helped her husband to gain\r\npossession of her dead father's duchy, and won the hearts of all her\r\nsubjects by her goodness. While Francesco was engaged with affairs of\r\nstate, she directed the studies of her children, and gave her six sons\r\nan admirable training in learning and knightly exercises. \"Let us\r\nremember,\" she said to her son's tutor, the learned scholar Filelfo,\r\n\"that we have princes to educate, not only scholars.\" We find her\r\nsetting the boys a theme on the manner in which princes should draw up\r\ntreaties, and desiring them in her absence to write to her once a week\r\nin Latin. Several of these letters are still preserved in the archives\r\nof Milan. There is one, for instance, in which Lodovico, then sixteen\r\nyears old, tells his mother that he is sending her seventy quails, two\r\npartridges, and a pheasant, the result of a day's sport in the forest,\r\nbut takes care to assure her that the pleasures of the chase will never\r\nmake him neglect his books.\r\n\r\nMany are the pleasant glimpses we catch of the family circle, whether in\r\nthe Corte vecchia or old ducal palace of the Viscontis at Milan, in the\r\nbeautiful park and gardens of the Castello at Pavia, or in their country\r\nhomes of Vigevano and Binasco. We see Duke Francesco riding out with his\r\nyoung sons through the streets of Milan, visiting the churches and\r\nconvents that were rising on all sides, the new hospital, which was the\r\nobject of Madonna Bianca's tender care, the oak avenues and gardens with\r\nwhich she loved to surround her favourite shrines. We find the boys at\r\nhome, helping their mother to entertain her guests with music and\r\ndancing, and accompanying her on visits to the noble Milanese families.\r\nOne day their grandmother, Agnese di Maino, came to see the duke's sons\r\nwith an old gentleman from Navarre, who went home declaring that he had\r\nnever seen such wise and well-educated children; another time we hear of\r\na Madonna Giovanna coming to spend the day at the palace, and dancing\r\nall the evening with Lodovico Maria; and when the duchess took her\r\nyounger children to visit Don Tommaseo de' Rieti, general laughter was\r\nexcited by the little four-year-old Ascanio, the future cardinal, who\r\nwalked straight up to a portrait of the duke, exclaiming, \"There is my\r\nlord father!\" When the newly elected Pope Pius II., who as Eneas Sylvius\r\nPiccolomini had often been in Milan, came to visit the duke in 1457, he\r\nfound Galeazzo reading Cicero, and his little brothers with their\r\ncherub faces sitting round their tutor, intent on his discourse; while\r\non one occasion their sister Ippolita, the pupil of the great\r\nConstantine Lascaris, pronounced a Latin oration in honour of His\r\nHoliness. On Christmas day, a festival which was always celebrated with\r\nmuch pomp at Milan, each of the duke's four elder sons came forward and\r\nrecited a Latin speech, and Lodovico delighted all who were present by\r\nthe ease and grace of his bearing, and the eloquent periods in which he\r\nextolled his father's great deeds in peace and war.\r\n\r\nThe duke himself always singled out Lodovico for especial notice, and\r\nsaid the boy would do great things. It was, no doubt, his sense of the\r\nyouthful Moro's talents that made Francesco choose him, at the age of\r\nthirteen, to be the leader of the body of three thousand men which were\r\nto join in the Crusade preached by Pope Pius II. On the 2nd of June,\r\n1464, the ducal standard, bearing the golden lion of the house of Sforza\r\nand the adder of the Visconti, was solemnly committed to the charge of\r\nthe young Crusader, before the eyes of the whole court, on the piazza in\r\nfront of the old palace, which was gaily decorated for the occasion with\r\ngarlands and tapestries. But the Pope died, and the idea of the Crusade\r\nwas abandoned. Lodovico, however, was sent by his father to Cremona, the\r\ncity which had been Duchess Bianca's dowry, and whose inhabitants were\r\namong the most loyal subjects of the Sforza princes. Here he lived\r\nduring the next two years, enjoying his foretaste of power, and making\r\nhimself very popular with the Cremonese. In 1465, his accomplished\r\nsister was married to Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, and Lorenzo de Medici\r\ncame to Milan for the nuptials. Then these two men, who in days to come\r\nwere to be so often named together as the most illustrious patrons of\r\nart and letters in the Renaissance, met for the first time, and\r\ndiscovered the mutual tastes which in future years often brought them\r\ninto close relation.\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of Duke Francesco in 1466 brought a change in\r\nLodovico's position, and the ingratitude with which the new duke,\r\nGaleazzo, treated his widowed mother, naturally irritated his brothers.\r\nIn October, 1468, Bianca retired to Cremona, where she died a week\r\nafter her arrival--\"more from sorrow of heart than sickness of body,\"\r\nwrote her doctor. The good duchess was buried by her husband's side in\r\nthe Duomo of Milan, and was long and deeply lamented both by her\r\nchildren and subjects, and by none more than her son Lodovico, who\r\nalways remembered his mother with the deepest affection. But he remained\r\non good terms with Galeazzo, and was deputed by the new duke to receive\r\nhis bride, Bona of Savoy, when the princess arrived at Genoa, from the\r\nFrench court, where her youth had been spent with her sister, the wife\r\nof King Louis XI. During the next ten years Lodovico lived in enforced\r\nidleness at the Milanese court, and, freed from the restraint of his\r\nparents' authority, abandoned himself to idle pleasures. All we have\r\nfrom his pen at this period are two short letters. In one, written from\r\nMilan and dated April 19, 1476, he asks the Cardinal of Novara to stand\r\ngodfather to the illegitimate son whom his mistress, Lucia Marliani,\r\nCountess of Melzi, had borne him, and who was to be baptized at Pavia.\r\nThe other is an affectionate letter addressed from Vigevano a year later\r\nto Lucia herself, rejoicing to hear of her well-being, and looking\r\nforward to seeing her after the feast of St. George. Whether the son was\r\nLeone Sforza, afterwards apostolic protonotary, or whether he was the\r\nchild whose death Lodovic lamented a few years later, does not appear,\r\nbut all his life the Moro retained a sincere regard for the mother,\r\nLucia Marliani, and left her certain lands by his will.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the conduct of his elder brother Galeazzo he had the worst\r\npossible example. Once in possession of supreme power, the new duke gave\r\nhimself up to the most unbridled course of vice and cruelty. The\r\nprofligacy of his life, and the horrible tortures which he inflicted on\r\nthe hapless victims of his jealousy and anger, caused Milanese\r\nchroniclers to describe him as another Nero. He was commonly believed to\r\nhave poisoned both his mother and Dorotea Gonzaga, the betrothed bride\r\nof whom he wished to rid himself when a more desirable marriage\r\npresented itself. These charges were probably groundless, but some of\r\nhis actions went far to justify the suspicions of madness which he\r\naroused in the minds of his contemporaries. When, for instance, he\r\nordered his artists to decorate a hall at the Castello at Pavia with\r\nportraits of the ducal family in a single night, under pain of instant\r\ndeath, the Ferrarese Diarist had good reason to describe the new Duke of\r\nMilan as a prince guilty of great crimes and greater follies. At the\r\nsame time, Galeazzo showed himself a liberal patron of art and learning.\r\nHe founded a library at Milan, invited doctors and priests to the\r\nUniversity of Pavia, and brought singers from all parts of the world to\r\nform the choir of the ducal chapel. During his reign a whole army of\r\npainters and sculptors were employed to decorate the interior of the\r\nCastello of the Porta Giovia at Milan, which his father had rebuilt when\r\nhe gave up the ground in front of the old palace to the builders of the\r\nDuomo, and which now became the chief ducal residence. Under his\r\nauspices printing was introduced, and the first book ever produced in\r\nItaly, the Grammar of Lascaris--a Greek professor who had taken refuge\r\nat the court of the Sforzas on the fall of Constantinople--appeared at\r\nMilan in 1476. The splendour of his court surpassed anything that had\r\nbeen yet seen. Great rejoicings took place in 1469, when Lorenzo de\r\nMedici came to Milan to stand godfather to the duke's infant son, and\r\nGaleazzo was so delighted at the sight of the costly diamond necklace\r\nwhich the Magnificent Medici presented to Duchess Bona on this occasion,\r\nthat he exclaimed, \"You must be godfather to all my children!\" The\r\nwealth and luxury displayed by the duke and duchess when they visited\r\nFlorence two years later with a suite of two thousand persons,\r\nscandalized the old-fashioned citizens, and, in Machiavelli's opinion,\r\nproved the beginning of a marked degeneracy in public morals.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Milanese were amused by the _fêtes_ provided for them,\r\nand dazzled by the sight of all this splendour; but retribution came in\r\ntime, and on the Feast of St. Stephen in the winter of 1476, Duke\r\nGaleazzo was assassinated at the doors of the church of S. Stefano by\r\nthree courtiers whom he had wronged. The Milanese chronicler Bernardino\r\nCorio gives a dramatic account of the scene, which he himself witnessed,\r\nand relates how Bona, who was haunted by a presentiment of coming evil,\r\nimplored her lord not to leave the Castello that morning, and how three\r\nravens were seen hovering about Galeazzo's head on that very morning,\r\nwhen, in his splendid suit of crimson brocade, the tall and handsome\r\nduke entered the church doors, while the choir sang the words, \"_Sic\r\ntransit gloria mundi_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The peace of Italy is dead!\" exclaimed Pope Sixtus IV. when the news of\r\nGaleazzo's murder reached him. And the issue proved that he was not far\r\nwrong. In her distress, the widowed duchess, who seems to have been\r\nfondly attached to her husband, in spite of his crimes and follies,\r\naddressed a piteous letter to the Holy Father owning her dead lord's\r\nguilt, and asking him if he could issue a bull absolving him from his\r\nmany and grievous sins. In her anxiety for Galeazzo's soul, she promised\r\nto atone as far as possible for his crimes by making reparation to those\r\nwhom he had wronged, and offered to build churches and monasteries,\r\nendow hospitals, and perform other works of mercy. The Pope does not\r\nseem to have returned a direct answer to this touching prayer, but he\r\ntook advantage of Bona's present mood to hurry on the marriage of\r\nCaterina Sforza, the duke's natural daughter, with his own nephew,\r\nGirolamo Riario, which had been arranged by Galeazzo, and which took\r\nplace in the following April. Lodovico was absent at the time of\r\nGaleazzo's assassination, and with his brother Sforza, Duke of Bari, was\r\nspending Christmas at the court of Louis XI. at Tours. They had not been\r\nbanished, as Corio asserts, but, tired of idleness and fired with a wish\r\nto see the world, they had gone on a journey to France, and, after\r\nvisiting Paris and Angers, were on their way home when the news of the\r\nduke's murder reached them. But if any hope of obtaining a share in the\r\ngovernment had been aroused in Lodovico's heart, it was doomed to speedy\r\ndisappointment. Cecco Simonetta, the able secretary and minister who had\r\nadministered the state under Galeazzo, kept a firm hold on the reins of\r\ngovernment, ruled the Milanese in the name of Duchess Bona and her young\r\nson Gian Galeazzo. The Sforza brothers soon found their position\r\nintolerable, and the intervention of a friendly neighbour, the Marquis\r\nof Mantua, was necessary before they could obtain any recognition of\r\ntheir right. At his request, Bona agreed to give each of her\r\nbrothers-in-law a suitable residence in Milan, as well as a portion of\r\n12,500 ducats from the revenues of their mother's inheritance, the city\r\nof Cremona. Filippo Sforza, the second of the brothers, who is described\r\nas weak in intellect and a person of no account, was content to live\r\npeaceably in Milan, where his very existence seems to have been\r\nforgotten by his family, and where the only mention of him that occurs\r\nagain is that of his death in 1492. The other brothers were sent to\r\nGenoa, where an insurrection had broken out, and succeeded in subduing\r\nthe rebels and restoring peace. But when they returned to Milan at the\r\nhead of a victorious army, with their kinsman the valiant Condottiere\r\nRoberto di Sanseverino, a movement was set on foot among the old\r\nGhibelline followers of Duke Francesco to obtain the regency for Sforza,\r\nDuke of Bari. Cries of _Moro! Moro!_ began to be heard in the streets of\r\nMilan. Simonetta, becoming alarmed, threw Donato del Conte, one of the\r\nGhibelline leaders, into prison, upon which Sanseverino and the Sforzas\r\nloudly demanded his release. Simonetta gave them fair words in return,\r\nand induced the dissatisfied chiefs to meet in the park of the Castello,\r\nwhere they agreed to lay down their arms. But Sanseverino, suspecting\r\ntreachery, set spurs to his horse, and, riding with drawn sword in his\r\nhand out of the city through the Porta Vercellina, crossed the Ticino,\r\nand did not pause until he was in safety. His companions soon followed\r\nhis example. Ottaviano Sforza, the youngest of the family, a brave lad\r\nof eighteen, was drowned in crossing the swollen Adda, and his three\r\nremaining brothers were condemned to perpetual exile. Sforza was\r\nbanished to his duchy of Bari, in the kingdom of Naples, Ascanio to\r\nPerugia, and Lodovico to the city of Pisa.\r\n\r\nDuring the next eighteen months Lodovico lived at Pisa, fretting his\r\nheart out in exile and wasting the best years of his life, as he\r\ncomplained to Lorenzo de Medici. His friend could only counsel patience,\r\nfor, sympathize as he might with the banished prince, Lorenzo was\r\nclosely allied with the rulers of Milan, and Lodovico soon saw that his\r\nonly hope of seeing his native land again was to be found in the support\r\nof Ferrante, King of Naples, the sworn foe of the Medici. This monarch\r\nlooked on Simonetta as a traitorous villain who had taken advantage of\r\nBona's weakness to usurp the supreme power in Milan, and wrote to King\r\nLouis XI, begging him to come to his kinswoman's help and assist in\r\nrestoring the Duke of Bari and his brother to their rights. But the\r\nFrench king had no wish to be drawn into the quarrel, and when Ferrante\r\nendeavoured to obtain the restoration of his exiled kinsmen by fair\r\nmeans and had failed, Sforza and Lodovico resolved to try the fortunes\r\nof war once more. Roberto di Sanseverino, whose mother had been a niece\r\nof Duke Francesco, and who had large estates of his own in Lombardy,\r\nplaced his sword at their disposal, and they knew they could reckon on\r\nthe secret support of their Sforza and Visconti kinsmen in Milan. Among\r\nthese, Lodovico had a devoted partisan in Beatrice d'Este, the sister of\r\nDuke Ercole of Ferrara, who had lately been left a widow for the second\r\ntime by the death of her husband, the brave soldier Tristan Sforza, and\r\nwho kept up a secret correspondence with the exiled princes. Early in\r\nFebruary, 1479, the Sforza brothers and Roberto di Sanseverino landed in\r\nGenoa and boldly raised the standard of revolt. Simonetta retaliated by\r\nconfiscating their revenues and proclaiming them rebels, while he hired\r\nErcole D'Este and Federigo Gonzaga to join the Florentines in resisting\r\nthe advance of the Neapolitan forces. In the midst of these warlike\r\npreparations, Sforza Duke of Bari died very suddenly at Genoa. His death\r\nwas attributed, after the fashion of the day, to poison secretly sent\r\nhim from Milan; but, as Corio remarks, many persons thought that his\r\nexcessive stoutness was the true cause of his decease. Lodovico, whom\r\nthe King of Naples immediately invested with the dukedom of Bari in his\r\nbrother's stead, now crossed the Genoese Alps and boldly invaded the\r\nterritory of Tortona. But the enterprise was a perilous one, and the\r\nallied forces of Milan were preparing to crush his little army, when an\r\nunexpected turn of fortune altered the whole condition of affairs.\r\nDuchess Bona, a very beautiful woman, but, as Commines remarks, \"_une\r\ndame de petit sens_\" had become infatuated with a certain Antonio\r\nTassino, a Ferrarese youth of low extraction, whom Galeazzo had\r\nappointed carver at the royal table, and who, after the duke's death,\r\nhad made himself indispensable to his mistress. The _liaison_ had\r\ncreated a coolness between the duchess and her prime minister, of which\r\nBeatrice d'Este and some of the Sforza party cleverly availed\r\nthemselves to widen the breach. They deplored the growing arrogance of\r\nSimonetta, and lamented the success of his intrigues against Lodovico,\r\nwho was his sister-in-law's nearest relative and rightful protector.\r\nActing on their suggestion, Bona took a sudden resolve. She sent a\r\nmessenger to invite Lodovico to return to Milan in his nephew's name,\r\nand late in the evening of the 7th of October, 1479, the Moro, leaving\r\nthe camp at Tortona, arrived in Milan, and was secretly admitted into\r\nthe Castello by the garden door. The duchess and her son, Gian Galeazzo,\r\na boy of ten, received him with open arms, and great was the joy among\r\nall the Ghibellines of Milan, when they heard to their surprise that\r\nDuke Francesco's son was once more among them. Simonetta looked grave,\r\nas he well might, when he heard the news. \"Most illustrious duchess,\" he\r\nsaid to Bona the next day, \"do you know what will happen? My head will\r\nbe cut off, and before long you will lose this state.\" But he proceeded\r\nto congratulate Lodovico on his return, and was received by him in the\r\nmost courteous manner. When the news of these events reached the rival\r\ncamps outside Milan, a truce was proclaimed, and the leaders on either\r\nside disbanded their armies. The object of the expedition was attained,\r\nand Lodovico restored to his rightful place at Milan. But neither\r\nRoberto di Sanseverino nor the other Ghibelline leader could be content\r\nwhile their hated rival Simonetta was still at large. They sent\r\nmessengers to Lodovico, imperiously demanding his summary punishment,\r\nand declaring that they would never lay down their arms until he and his\r\nconfederates were imprisoned. After some delay, Lodovico yielded to\r\ntheir demand; Bona's faithful secretary was arrested and sent to Pavia\r\nwith his brother, while the fickle populace sacked their houses.\r\nCongratulations poured in from all the kinsfolk of the Sforza family.\r\nCaterina Sforza, the illegitimate daughter of Duke Galeazzo, who had\r\nbeen brought up by Bona with her own children, wrote from Rome, where\r\nshe was living with her husband, Girolamo Riario, Count of Imola and\r\nForli at the papal court, to rejoice with her brother the young duke\r\nover the fall of the hated minister; \"_quelo nefandissimo Cecho_ the\r\nmurderer of our family and our flesh and blood.\" Now at length, he\r\nadds, she will be able to visit Milan and see her beloved mother once\r\nmore in peace and safety. And her husband's uncle, Pope Sixtus IV.,\r\nhimself wrote to congratulate both duke and duchess on the arrest of\r\nSimonetta and the restoration of peace and tranquillity. Lodovico was\r\nnow formally associated with Duchess Bona in the regency, and his\r\nbrother Ascanio was recalled and advanced to the dignity of Archbishop\r\nof Pavia. Before many months were over peace was concluded with\r\nFlorence, and with the full approval of King Ferrante, the Duke of\r\nFerrara accepted Lodovico Sforza as his future son-in-law.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile party feeling still ran high in Milan, and the Ghibellines,\r\nwith Sanseverino and Pusterla at their head, never ceased to clamour for\r\nSimonetta's head. People began to complain that Lodovico, who had been\r\nbrought back to power by the Ghibellines, was after all a Guelph at\r\nheart, and a traitor to his party. In vain the Moro advocated milder\r\nmeasures, and wrote a letter to Simonetta, offering to release him on\r\npayment of a ransom. The old secretary, who was upwards of seventy years\r\nof age, refused, saying that he was ill and weary of life, and had no\r\nfear of death. At length Lodovico, vexed by the continual recriminations\r\nof his Ghibelline followers, reluctantly gave way. Bona signed the death\r\nwarrant of her old servant, and on the 30th of October, 1480, Simonetta\r\nwas beheaded in the Castello of Pavia. His brother Giovanni, an able and\r\nlearned scholar, was released, and lived to write the famous Sforziada,\r\nor history of Duke Francesco's great deeds, which he dedicated to his\r\nson Lodovico.\r\n\r\nAlready one-half of the unfortunate minister's prophecy had come true;\r\nthe other half was soon to be fulfilled. For a few months Bona rejoiced\r\nin her freedom from the cares of state, and left all to Lodovico, \"who\r\ncould do her no greater pleasure than not to speak of these things,\"\r\nsays Commines. She herself was treated with the utmost respect, and\r\nspent her time in feasting and dancing, and loaded her favourite with\r\nhonours. Tassino lived in rooms next to her own, and rode out with the\r\nduchess on pillion behind him. But her favourite, encouraged by the\r\nfolly of his mistress, became every day more indolent, until one day he\r\nkept Lodovico Sforza and the chief officers of state waiting at the door\r\nof his room while he finished his toilet. Yet nothing could cure Bona's\r\ninfatuation, and she went so far as to beg Lodovico to appoint her\r\nminion's father to be governor of the _Rocca_ of Porta Zobia (Giovia),\r\nas the Castello of Milan was called. Fortunately Eustachio, who had been\r\nappointed to the post by Duke Galeazzo, and solemnly charged to hold it,\r\nin case of his own death, until his son was of age, refused to give up\r\nthe keys; and the young duke and his brother Ermes were conducted into\r\nthe Rocca, while at the same moment Tassino received an order from the\r\nCouncil to leave Milan. This he did without delay, taking with him a\r\nlarge sum of money and many valuable pearls and jewels which he had\r\nreceived from the duchess. When Bona heard of her favourite's flight she\r\nflew into a frantic rage, and, \"forgetful alike of honour and maternal\r\nduty,\" as Corio writes, she renounced her share of the regency, saying\r\nthat she placed her son in his uncle's care, and left Milan. \"Like some\r\ndemented woman,\" continues Corio, she fled as far as Abbiategrasso,\r\nwhere she was detained by Lodovico's orders, and not allowed to proceed\r\nto France as she had intended. In the end, however, she effected her\r\npurpose, and retired to her brother-in-law's Louis XI.'s court, where\r\nshe remained during the next few years, vowing vengeance against\r\nLodovico, and bitterly repenting her weakness in having consented to his\r\nreturn. So Lodovico Moro, \"that hero of patience and cunning,\" as\r\nMichelet calls him, at length attained his object, and found himself\r\nsole Regent of Milan. _Merito e tempore_ was the motto which he had\r\nchosen for his own, and which he placed in golden letters on his shield,\r\nand illuminated on the vellum pages of his favourite books, in the firm\r\nbelief that all things come to the man who can learn to bide his time.\r\nHenceforth his head appeared together with that of his younger nephew on\r\nall coins and medals, and the words _Lodovico patrue gubernante_\r\ninscribed below.\r\n\r\nPandolfini, the Florentine ambassador, who had watched his course with\r\nprofound interest, sent a minute report of the latest developments of\r\npublic events to Lodovico's friend, the Magnificent Medici. A year\r\nbefore, when Lodovico had just returned to Milan, the envoy remarked,\r\n\"Signor Lodovico is very popular here, both with the people and with\r\nMadonna.\" Again, a little later, he wrote, \"Madonna trusts much in\r\nMesser Lodovico's good nature.\" Now he added, \"The whole government of\r\nthe kingdom is placed in Lodovico's hands.\" He could not refrain from an\r\nexpression of admiration at the peaceable manner in which this\r\nrevolution had been accomplished. \"With what ability and skill he has\r\neffected this sudden change!\" And he added, \"I tell him, if he uses his\r\nopportunities well, he will become the arbiter of the whole of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Caffi in A. S. L., xiii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWars of Venice and Ferrara--Invasion of Ferrara--Lodovico Sforza and\r\nAlfonso of Calabria come to the help of Ercole d'Este--Peace of Bagnolo\r\n--Prosperity of Ferrara, and cultivation of art and learning at Ercole's\r\ncourt--Guarino and Aldo Manuzio--Strozzi and Boiardo--Architecture and\r\npainting--The frescoes of the Schifanoia--Music and the drama--Education\r\nof Isabella and Beatrice d'Este.\r\n\r\n1482-1490\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the prince to whom Duke Ercole had betrothed his younger\r\ndaughter, and who had suddenly become one of the chief personages in\r\nNorth Italy. But more than ten years were to elapse before the\r\nchild-bride even saw her affianced husband. During that time both Milan\r\nand Ferrara passed through many vicissitudes, and at one moment\r\nBeatrice's father and his state were reduced to the utmost extremity.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians availed themselves of the troubled state of Lombardy and\r\nthe civil strife that divided the house of Sforza, to attack their old\r\nenemy the Duke of Ferrara. In 1482 Roberto di Sanseverino, the valiant\r\ncaptain who had been one of the chief instruments in restoring his\r\nkinsman Lodovico Sforza to his country, left Milan in a rage, because he\r\ndid not consider his salary sufficient, and offered his services to the\r\nRepublic of Venice. With his gallant sons to help him, he invaded the\r\nterritory of Ferrara at the head of an army of seventeen thousand men,\r\nand carried all before him. The Pope as usual took up the quarrel of the\r\nVenetians, in the hope of sharing the spoil, and while Ercole's ally,\r\nKing Ferrante of Naples, was engaged in resisting the papal forces, the\r\nGenoese, who had revolted against Duchess Bona in 1478, and elected a\r\ndoge of their own, occupied Lodovico Sforza's attention. The Ferrarese\r\ntroops were completely defeated in a battle under the citadel of\r\nArgenta, many of the Ferrarese leaders were slain, and the duke's\r\nnephew, Niccolo da Correggio, and three hundred men were taken prisoners\r\nto Venice. Sanseverino made good use of his advantage, and his son\r\nGaspare, better known by his nickname of Fracassa, marched to the very\r\ngates of Ferrara, and planted the Lion of St. Mark on the peacocks'\r\nhouse in the ducal park. Meanwhile the plague had broken out in Ferrara,\r\nand so great was the scarcity of wheat in the beleaguered city, that\r\nBattista Guarino, the tutor of the young Princess Isabella, applied to\r\nher betrothed husband Francesco Gonzaga for a grant of corn to save him\r\nfrom starvation. Worse than all, Duke Ercole himself lay dangerously ill\r\nwithin the Castello, and a report of his death was circulated through\r\nthe city. At this critical moment Duchess Leonora once more showed her\r\ncourage and presence of mind. Seeing the greatness of the danger, she\r\nsent her children with a safe escort to Modena, and calling the\r\nmagistrates together, she harangued them from the garden loggia, and\r\nbade them be true to their old lords of the house of Este. The citizens,\r\nmoved to tears at the sight of Leonora's majesty and courage, shouted\r\nwith one voice, \"Diamante!\"--the watchword of the house of Este, and\r\nvowed to die for their duke. In their enthusiasm, the people broke open\r\nthe palace doors, and rushing into the chamber where Ercole lay on his\r\nsick-bed, covered his hands with kisses, and would not be satisfied\r\nuntil they had heard his voice again and knew him to be alive. After\r\nthis outburst of loyalty, they rallied bravely to the defence of the\r\ncity. Every man who could bear arms in Ferrara helped to man the walls,\r\nand the country-folk, rising in thousands, harassed the invading army\r\nand cut off their supplies. Fortunately, help was at hand. On the one\r\nhand, Lodovico Sforza's troops checked the advance of the Venetians on\r\nthe side of Modena; on the other, Ercole's brother-in-law, Alfonso, Duke\r\nof Calabria, himself rode at the head of fifty horsemen and a troop of\r\ninfantry to the help of the beleaguered city.\r\n\r\nThroughout the long struggle that followed, Lodovico Sforza proved\r\nhimself a wise and faithful friend of the house of Este, and it was\r\nchiefly owing to him that Ferrara preserved her independence. But the\r\nduke and his people had to make great sacrifices on their part, and at\r\nthe peace of Bagnolo, which was finally concluded in 1484, seven towns\r\nwere ceded to Venice, and the fertile district of Rovigo in the\r\nPolesina, \"_un petit pays_,\" in the words of Commines, \"_tout environné\r\nd'eau et abondant a merveille en tous biens_.\"\r\n\r\nA period of renewed peace and prosperity followed upon these disastrous\r\nwars. Ercole, although in his early youth he had proved himself a\r\nvaliant soldier, had in reality far greater taste for the arts of peace\r\nthan for those of war, and now devoted himself to the more congenial\r\ntask of adorning Ferrara and cultivating letters. His father Niccolo\r\nIII. had been the first prince in Northern Italy to take part in the\r\nrevival of Greek learning that had been set on foot in Naples and\r\nFlorence. He it was who, in 1402, revived the ancient University of\r\nFerrara, and invited the best scholars of the day to give lectures to\r\nits students. At his prayer, the Sicilian Hellenist Aurispa, who had\r\ntravelled to Greece and Constantinople in search of Greek manuscripts,\r\nfixed his residence at Ferrara; while Battista Guarino of Verona became\r\nthe tutor of Niccolo's own son Leonello, and inspired the young prince\r\nwith that ardour for learning which made him the most accomplished ruler\r\nof his time. It was Niccolo, again, who invited the celebrated Paduan\r\ndoctor, Michele Savonarola, to fill the chair of medicine at the\r\nUniversity of Ferrara. Michele's son became court physician to Ercole,\r\nand his grandson, the famous Dominican friar, Fra Girolamo Savonarola,\r\nwho had forsaken the study of medicine to take the vows of a preaching\r\nbrother, delivered his first course of Lent sermons in Ferrara during\r\nthat troubled year 1482.\r\n\r\nThe General Council held at Ferrara in 1438 brought some of the first\r\nGreek Oriental scholars together in that city, and Niccolo d'Este\r\nhimself assisted at many of the discussions held by these learned\r\nprofessors. His son Leonello, besides encouraging students by his own\r\nexample, devoted great pains and expense to the University library which\r\nhe founded, while his successor, Duke Borso, pensioned poor students,\r\nwho were clothed and fed at his cost. Ercole now followed in his\r\nfather's and brother's steps with so much success that under his reign\r\nthe University of Ferrara became the foremost in Italy, and boasted no\r\nless than forty-five professors, while the number of students reached\r\nfour hundred and seventy-four. In those days the most renowned scholars\r\nof the age flocked from all parts of Italy to hear Guarino lecture; and\r\nAldo Manuzio, the great printer, and his illustrious friend Pico della\r\nMirandola, the phoenix of the Renaissance, came to Ferrara to sit at the\r\nfeet of this revered teacher. Here Aldo acquired the passion for Greek\r\nliterature which made him inscribe the word Philhellene after his name\r\non his first printed books. Here, in his own turn, he lectured on Greek\r\nand Latin authors to the cultured youth of Ercole's court, and here he\r\nwould have set up his printing-press, under his friend Duchess Leonora's\r\npatronage, if the Venetian war had not forced him to leave Ferrara. Both\r\nfrom the court of Alberto Pio at Carpi, where he found refuge with a\r\nkinsman of the Estes, and at Venice, where he founded his famous\r\nprinting-press, he kept up frequent communications with the duke's\r\nfamily, and dedicated books to young Cardinal Ercole, and bound and\r\nprinted choice editions of Petrarch and Virgil for his sister Isabella\r\nd'Este. But if Duke Ercole emulated the zeal of his predecessors in the\r\nencouragement of classical learning, he surpassed them all in his love\r\nof travel, of building, and of theatrical representations. During the\r\nnext twenty years he indulged freely in all of these favourite pursuits.\r\n\r\nHis opportunities of travel, indeed, were limited by the duties of his\r\nposition; but whenever he could find leisure, he gratified his roving\r\ntaste by paying frequent visits to Milan or Venice, where the\r\nmagnificent palace bestowed upon his ancestor Nicolas II. in the last\r\ncentury, but confiscated during the war with Ferrara, had been restored\r\nto him at the peace of Bagnolo. In 1484, he took Duchess Leonora there\r\nwith a suite of seven hundred persons. On this occasion the palace\r\noriginally decorated by Duke Borso was sumptuously restored, and the\r\nDoge and Senate entertained their guests with princely hospitality. A\r\nmore distant pilgrimage to the shrine of S. Jago of Compostella in\r\nSpain, which Ercole had planned in 1487, had to be abandoned, owing to\r\nthe opposition of Pope Innocent VIII.; but eight years later the duke\r\npaid another visit to Florence, on the pretence of discharging a vow\r\nwhich he had made to Our Lady of the Annunziata. To the last the\r\nadventurous disposition of the Estes, the love of seeing and hearing new\r\nthings, marked his character and governed his actions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his imagination found plenty of food for activity at home, and\r\nnothing interfered with his love of building or with the delight which\r\nhe took in the stage. Under him, Ferrara became one of the finest cities\r\nin Italy. Her broad streets and spacious squares, her noble statues and\r\nimposing monuments, the stately symmetry of her well-kept ways, made a\r\ndeep impression on Lodovico Sforza when he visited his wife's home. At\r\nthe beginning of his reign Ercole had sent to Florence to borrow\r\nAlberti's Treatise on Architecture from Lorenzo de' Medici, and had\r\ncarried out his improvements on the principles advocated by the\r\nRenaissance architect. On every side new churches and palaces rose into\r\nbeing, a lofty Campanile was added to the ancient Lombard Cathedral, an\r\nequestrian statue of Niccolo III. and a bronze effigy of Duke Borso\r\nadorned the piazza in front of the Castello. Soon Ercole's subjects\r\ncaught their duke's passion for building, and vied with him in erecting\r\nnew and sumptuous houses. His brother, Cardinal Sigismondo, raised the\r\nPalazzo Diamante, that magnificent Renaissance structure in the Via\r\ndegli Angeli. The Trotti and the Costabili, the Strozzi and Boschetti,\r\nall followed suit and built palatial residences in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThese fine buildings were surrounded with spacious gardens. One of\r\nErcole's first improvements had been to lay out the noble park outside\r\nthe town, and to people it with stags and goats, with gazelles and\r\nantelopes and the spotted giraffes which Niccolo da Correggio describes\r\nin his poems; and on the gates leading from the city were marble busts\r\ncarved by the hand of Sperandio, the famous medallist who had worked so\r\nlong for the ducal house, and who has left us portraits of all the chief\r\npersonages at the Ferrarese court. The courtyard of the ancient Este\r\npalace was adorned with wide marble staircases, the villa of Belfiore\r\nwas enlarged and beautified, while that of Belriguardo, twelve miles\r\nfrom the city, on the banks of the Po, became celebrated as the most\r\nsumptuous of all the stately pleasure-houses in which Renaissance\r\nprinces took delight. No pains or expense were spared in the decoration\r\nof these luxurious country houses. The terraced gardens and marble\r\nloggias were adorned with fountains and statues, the halls were hung\r\nwith costly tapestries and gold and silver embroideries. Eastern carpets\r\nand carved ivories, cameos and intaglios, precious gems and rare\r\nmajolica from Urbino and Casteldurante were brought together in the\r\nCamerini of the Castello and the halls of the Schifanoia palace, that\r\nfavourite Sans-Souci of the Este princes close to the court-church of S.\r\nMaria in Vado and to the convent of Leonora's friends, the nuns of S.\r\nVito. In this charming retreat, where Borso and Ercole alike loved to\r\nescape from the cares of state, we may still see the remnants of these\r\nsplendid decorations which once adorned these halls: the painted\r\narabesques and stucco frieze of children playing musical instruments,\r\nthe barrel-vaulted ceilings, and marble doorways with their rows of\r\ncherub heads and dolphins. There the unicorn which Borso took for his\r\ndevice, figures side by side with the imperial eagle granted him by\r\nFrederic III when he came to visit Ferrara, and the fleur-de-lis of\r\nFrance, which the Estes were privileged to bear on their coat-of-arms.\r\nThere we still see fragments of the frescoes on the months and seasons\r\nof the year which Cossa and his scholars painted at the bidding of\r\nsuccessive dukes. Borso is there on his white horse as he rides out\r\nhunting, attended by falconers and pages leading his favourite\r\ngreyhounds in the leash; or looking on at the races of St. George's Day,\r\nsurrounded by scholars and courtiers, dwarfs and jesters, and fair\r\nladies clad in glittering robes of cloth of silver and gold. All the\r\npageant of court-life in old Ferrara, as it was in the days when Duke\r\nErcole reigned and Isabella and Beatrice d'Este grew up under the good\r\nDuchess Leonora's care, passes again before our eyes, as we linger in\r\nthese low halls of the little red-brick palace among the fruit trees of\r\nthis deserted quarter.\r\n\r\nNiccolo III. and his elder sons had all been liberal patrons of art, and\r\nhad invited the best artists they could find from other parts of Italy.\r\nVittore Pisanello and Jacopo Bellini had both of them visited Ferrara\r\nand painted portraits of the Este princes--that of Leonello, with his\r\nlong hooked nose and low forehead, is still preserved at Bergamo, and\r\nPiero de' Franceschi, the mighty Umbrian, is said to have supplied a\r\ndesign for Duke Borso's tomb. But it was in later years, under Ercole's\r\nreign, that this little group of native artists arose, and that Cosimo\r\nTura and his followers founded the school which gradually spread to\r\nBologna and Modena and boasted such masters as Lorenzo Costa and\r\nFrancia, or helped to mould the genius of a Raphael and a Correggio.\r\nTura himself remained at Ferrara all his life, painting altar-pieces for\r\nDuchess Leonora's favourite churches, as well as frescoes in the duke's\r\nvillas and portraits of the different members of the ducal family in\r\nturn. In 1472, before the Duke's marriage, he painted the portrait of\r\nErcole--strange to say--together with his illegitimate daughter Lucrezia\r\nd'Este, to be sent as a present to his bride, Leonora of Aragon, at her\r\nfather's court of Naples. Again, in the summer of 1485, he was called\r\nupon in his capacity of court painter to paint the likeness of the\r\nyouthful Isabella for her affianced husband, Francesco Gonzaga; and\r\nbefore the year was out he had to perform the same task for the other\r\nlittle bride, who had just returned from Naples. The following paper in\r\nthe Ferrarese archives fixes the exact date of the portrait, which was\r\nevidently sent as a Christmas gift to Lodovico Sforza at Milan. \"On the\r\n24th of December, 1485, Cosimo Tura received four gold florins from the\r\nduke, for painting from life the face and bust of the Illustrissima\r\nMadonna Beatrice, to be sent to Messer Lodovico Maria Sforza, Duca di\r\nBari, consort of the said Beatrice--Carlo Continga taking it to him.\"\r\nUnfortunately, both of these portraits have perished, and the only\r\nrepresentation of Beatrice as a girl that we have is the sculptor\r\nCristoforo Romano's well-known bust in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nWhile the native schools of painting became active and prosperous under\r\nErcole's auspices, a flourishing school of arts and crafts arose in\r\nFerrara under the immediate patronage of the duchess. From the day of\r\nher marriage, Leonora not only showed that intelligent love of art and\r\nlearning which might have been expected in a princess of the house of\r\nAragon, but a warm interest in the well-being of her subjects, together\r\nwith excellent sense and a strong practical bent. At her invitation,\r\ntapestry-workers from Milan and Florence came to settle at Ferrara, and\r\nskilled embroiderers were brought over from Spain. The duchess herself\r\nsuperintended these workers, selected the colours and patterns, and\r\nbecame an authority in the choice of hangings and decoration of rooms.\r\nWhile Ercole had an insatiable passion for gems and cameos, antique\r\nmarbles and ivories, Leonora showed an especial taste for gold and\r\nsilver metal-work. Silver boxes and girdles curiously chased and\r\nengraved were constantly sent to the duchess by Milanese goldsmiths, and\r\namong the workers in this line whom she frequently employed was\r\nFrancesco Francia, the goldsmith painter of Bologna. In 1488, this\r\nartist sent her an exquisite chain of gold hearts linked together, which\r\nexcited general admiration, and may perhaps have been intended as a\r\nbridal gift for Elizabeth Gonzaga, the sister of Isabella's betrothed\r\nhusband, who visited Ferrara that spring, on her way to Urbino.\r\nLeonora's own jewels were said to be the finest and most artistic owned\r\nby any princess of her day, and, as in the case of other Renaissance\r\nladies, formed no inconsiderable portion of her fortune; and, in\r\nconsequence, they were frequently pawned to raise money for her\r\nhusband's wars. The duchess's famous necklace of pearls, we learn, was\r\nrepeatedly lent by the duke to bankers or goldsmiths in Rome and\r\nFlorence as pledges for the repayment of loans advanced during the war\r\nwith Venice.\r\n\r\nMusic was another of Ercole's favourite pastimes, and the choir of his\r\ncourt chapel at one time rivalled that of Milan, which was held to be\r\nthe best in Italy. Violinists and lute-players were brought from Naples\r\nto Ferrara, French and Spanish tenors were included among the singers\r\nwho accompanied the duke on his journeys. A still more distinctive\r\nfeature of his court were the theatrical representations, which became a\r\nprominent part of all the palace festivities, and which undoubtedly owed\r\nmuch to the duke's taste for dramatic art. Under his directions, a\r\nspacious theatre was fitted up in the old Gothic Palazzo della Ragione\r\non the cathedral square. Here Latin comedies were performed before an\r\naudience which included the most learned classical scholars of the day,\r\nand Italian dramas were seen for the first time upon the stage. In 1486,\r\nan Italian version of the _Menæchimi_, translated by Ercole himself,\r\nwas acted here, with interludes of masques and morris dances, violin\r\nmusic, and recitations. This was followed, a year later, by a\r\nperformance of _Cefalo_, one of the oldest of Italian dramas, a pastoral\r\nplay composed by Niccolo da Correggio, chiefly taken from Ovid's\r\n\"Metamorphoses,\" and which is said to have suggested the subjects of\r\nCorreggio's famous frescoes in the Abbess of San Paolo's parlour at\r\nParma. Each Christmas and carnival these theatrical representations were\r\nrepeated, and many were the distinguished visitors who came to Ferrara\r\nto witness these celebrated performances. The _Amphitryon_ and _Cassina_\r\nof Plautus were frequently given. On one occasion, a play adapted from a\r\ndialogue of Lucian's by Matteo Boiardo was acted. Another time, at the\r\nwedding of a Marchese Strozzi, a Latin comedy written by the\r\nbridegroom's brother, Ercole Strozzi, was performed before the whole\r\ncourt. Sometimes, by way of variety, sacred subjects were placed upon\r\nthe stages. Tableaux of the Annunciation and the history of Joseph were\r\nintroduced, accompanied with recitations and music. While the duke was\r\nknown to have a strong preference for classical plays, the duchess and\r\nher daughters took pleasure in lighter forms of literature, and\r\nencouraged the songs and romances which courtly poets wrote for their\r\nbenefit in the _lingua vulgare_. A new school of Italian poets sprang up\r\nat Ferrara in the last years of the century. Antonio Tebaldeo, the\r\nfriend of Castiglione and Raphael--\"our Tebaldeo,\" whom Pietro Bembo\r\ndeclared Raphael had painted in so lifelike a manner that he was not so\r\nexactly himself in actual life as in this portrait--had his home at\r\nFerrara in these early days, and enjoyed the favour of the Marchioness\r\nIsabella in his later years. While the elder Strozzi, Tito, had the\r\nreputation of being the best Latin poet of the day, his son Ercole\r\nbelonged to the circle of younger scholars, and, like his friends Bembo\r\nand Ariosto, wrote elegant Italian verses as well as Latin epistles and\r\norations. Then there was the blind poet Francesco Bello, the author of\r\nthe \"Mambriano,\" that heroic poem on the favourite Carlovingian legend;\r\nAndrea Cossa of Naples, who sang his own _rime_ and _strambotti_ to the\r\nmusic of the lute; Niccolo da Correggio, called by Isabella d'Este and\r\nSabba da Castiglione \"the most accomplished gentleman of the age, the\r\nforemost man in all Italy, in the art of poetry and in courtesy,\" who\r\ndevoted his muse to the service of gentle ladies, and composed _canzoni_\r\nand _capitoli_ or set Petrarch's sonnets to music for Isabella and\r\nBeatrice's pleasure. And among Ercole's courtiers at Ferrara there was\r\none still greater, Matteo Boiardo, Count of Scandiano, who was intimate\r\nwith both duke and duchess, and held many high posts at court. He was a\r\nmember of the splendid suite sent in 1473 to escort Leonora from Naples\r\nto Ferrara, and afterwards held the important post of Governor of Modena\r\nduring many years. But in the midst of official labours and court\r\nduties, Matteo was all the while engaged in writing his great work\r\nof the \"Orlando Innamorato,\" that wonderful epic in which classic and\r\nromantic ideas are mingled together as strangely as in Piero di Cosimo\r\nor Sandro Botticelli's paintings. The first cantos of his poem, begun in\r\n1472, were published at Venice in 1486, with a dedication to Duke\r\nErcole, and the work was continued at intervals throughout his life, and\r\nwas only interrupted by the death of the poet. This took place in 1494,\r\nwhen the first French armies were first seen descending upon Italy, and\r\nthe sweet singer of high romance broke off abruptly with a prophetic\r\nnote of warning in his last accents--\"While I am singing, I see all\r\nItaly set on fire by these Gauls, coming to ravage I know not how many\r\nfresh lands, alas!\"\r\n\r\nIn this city which was at once the home of Italian epic and Italian\r\ndrama, at this court where the boy Ariosto was to take up the song that\r\ndropped from the lips of Boiardo, and to wear the laurel in his turn,\r\nthe young princesses of Este grew up. There were three of them, for\r\nLucrezia, the duke's illegitimate daughter, had found a kind mother in\r\nthe duchess, and was brought up with her young step-sisters Isabella and\r\nBeatrice, until in 1487, she became the wife of Annibale Bentivoglio,\r\nand went to live in Bologna. Under Leonora's careful and vigilant eyes,\r\nthese maidens were trained in all the culture of the day. Their\r\nclassical studies were directed by Battista Guarino, the son of the\r\nlearned Verona humanist, the same who begged the Marquis of Mantua for a\r\ngrant of wheat that he might the better be able to teach his betrothed\r\nbride Madonna Isabella during the famine at Ferrara. With him they\r\nlearnt sufficient Latin to read Cicero and Virgil, as well as Greek and\r\nRoman history. Music and dancing were taught them almost from infancy.\r\nThey learnt to play the viol and lute, and sang _canzoni_ and sonnets to\r\nthe accompaniment of these instruments. Beatrice, we know, was\r\npassionately fond of music. She employed the great Pavian Lorenzo\r\nGusnasco to make her clavichords and viols of the finest order, and like\r\nher father, she never travelled without her favourite singers. Isabella\r\nherself had a beautiful voice, and sang with a sweetness and grace which\r\ncharmed all hearers. The most accomplished poets of the Renaissance,\r\nPietro Bembo and Niccolo da Correggio, Girolamo Casio and Antonio\r\nTebaldeo, were proud to hear her sing their verses, and the Vicenza\r\nscholar Trissino, forestalling Waller in this, wrote a _canzone_\r\naddressed to \"My Lady Isabella playing the lute.\"\r\n\r\nMesser Ambrogio da Urbino began to give Isabella dancing lessons almost\r\nas soon as she could walk. Later on a certain Messer Lorenzo Lavagnolo,\r\nwho had taught Elizabeth and Maddalena Gonzaga, the young sisters of the\r\nMarquis of Mantua, and had afterwards been sent to the court of Milan to\r\nteach Duchess Bona's daughters, came to Ferrara. This master, who was\r\ncommended to the Duchess of Milan by the Marchioness Barbara of Mantua\r\nas superior to all other professors of the art of dancing, gave lessons\r\nto Isabella and her sisters, as we learn from a letter which she wrote\r\nto her affianced husband, thanking him in her sister's name and her own\r\nfor having sent so excellent a teacher to undertake the task, and\r\nrecommending this faithful and devoted servant to His Excellency's\r\nnotice. A bill for making dresses and scenery that were employed in a\r\n\"_festa_\" composed by Messer Lorenzo for the duke's daughters is\r\npreserved in the Gonzaga archives, and at Lucrezia's wedding, in 1487,\r\nthis renowned master travelled to Bologna to direct the _fêtes_ given in\r\nhonour of her marriage.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of French seems to have formed part of an Italian lady's\r\neducation at this period, but even Isabella, with all her quickness and\r\ntalent, was never able to speak French fluently, and Beatrice had\r\nrecourse to interpreters when she received the visit of King Charles\r\nVIII. at Asti, and was required to make civil speeches in reply to his\r\ncompliments. But they read Provençal poetry and translations of Spanish\r\nromances from the rare volumes, sumptuously bound in crimson velvet with\r\nenamelled and jewelled clasps and corners, that were among the most\r\nprecious treasures of Duchess Leonora's cabinet. Above all, they took\r\ndelight in French romances, such as \"_I reali di Francia_\"--that book\r\nwhich was so popular with Italian ladies, and became familiar with the\r\nexploits of Roland and the paladins of Charlemagne's court. As they bent\r\nover their embroidery-frames at their lady mother's side, in the painted\r\ncamerini of the Castello, or under the acacias and lemon-trees of the\r\nSchifanoia villa, they listened to the wonderful fairy tales which\r\nMatteo Boiardo recited, and heard him tell how Rinaldo of Montalbano was\r\npelted with roses and lilies and made captive by Cupid's dames. Now and\r\nthen, on summer evenings, they were allowed to join in the water-parties\r\nat Belriguardo, and float down the stream in the ducal bucentaur to the\r\nsound of the court violins, or else take part in those hunting\r\nexpeditions for which Beatrice developed a passionate taste in\r\nafter-years. As the frescoes of Schifanoia show, hunting was always a\r\nfavourite pastime at the court of Ferrara. The duke kept many hundred\r\nhorses in his stables, and the greatest care was bestowed upon his breed\r\nof dogs and falcons. When Borso went to Rome in 1471, he took in his\r\nretinue eighty pages, each leading four greyhounds in a leash; and when\r\nhe entertained the Emperor Frederic III. at Ferrara, he presented him\r\nwith fifty of his best horses. Ercole often received gifts of Barbary\r\nhorses from the Sultan of Tunis or the famous Gonzaga stables that were\r\nreckoned the best in Italy, and bought Spanish jennets and steeds of\r\nIrish race to improve his own breed. And Duchess Leonora owned a special\r\nbreed of greyhounds which were held in high esteem, and a pair of which\r\nshe sent to Caterina Sforza, Madonna of Forli, at the humble request of\r\nthis adventurous lady.\r\n\r\nBut it was only on very rare occasions that the young princesses of Este\r\nwere allowed to leave their studies, which occupied their whole days,\r\nand, as we learn from their different preceptors' letters, absorbed\r\ntheir whole attention. Nor, we may be quite sure, was their religious\r\neducation neglected under the eye of their mother, a sincerely devout\r\nand pious woman, who took pleasure in the converse of learned Dominicans\r\nand Carmelites, and paid frequent visits to S. Vito, close to the\r\nSchifanoia villa, and to the Convent of Corpus Domini, in which church\r\nshe was buried. Her many charitable works, the liberality with which she\r\nhelped her poorer subjects, relieved their wants, and gave dowries to\r\nvirtuous maidens, as well as her munificence in adorning altars and\r\nchurches with rich ornaments, are recorded by every Ferrarese historian.\r\nSabadino degli Arienti places her high among the illustrious women of\r\nthe age, and says her deeds cannot fail to have opened the adamant doors\r\nof Paradise, while Castiglione speaks of her excellent virtues as known\r\nto the whole world, and pronounces her worthy to have reigned over a far\r\nlarger state. With the pattern of this admirable mother before their\r\neyes, with all that was choicest in art and fairest in nature around\r\nthem, Leonora's daughters grew up to womanhood, and insensibly acquired\r\nthat enthusiasm for beauty in all its varied forms, that fine taste and\r\nperception which distinguished them above their contemporaries, which\r\nmade Isabella at the end of her long life still the most attractive\r\nwoman of her day, and which caused the bravest soldiers and the wisest\r\nscholars to lament the untimely death of the youthful Duchess Beatrice.\r\nIn all the difficult and tangled ways which they were separately called\r\nupon to tread, the breath of scandal, the slander of idle tongues, never\r\nsullied their fair names. Both princesses held fast to the ideal of\r\ntheir girlhood, and, leading the same pure and spotless life, left the\r\nsame gracious memory behind them, alike in the old Mantuan city on the\r\nbanks of the classic Mincio, where Isabella's presence lingers like some\r\ndelicate perfume about the _Camerini_ of the ancient Castello, and in\r\nthat grander and more splendid court where Beatrice reigned for a few\r\nbrief years by the Moro's side at Milan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIsabella d'Este--Lodovico Sforza delays his wedding--Plot against his\r\nlife--Submission of Genoa--Duke Gian Galeazzo--The Sanseverini brothers\r\n--Messer Galeazzo made Captain-General of the Milanese armies--His\r\nmarriage to Bianca Sforza--Marriage of Gian Galeazzo to Isabella of\r\nAragon--Wedding festivities at Milan--Lodovico draws up his marriage\r\ncontract with Beatrice d'Este.\r\n\r\n1485-1490\r\n\r\n\r\nIsabella d'Este, the eldest of Ercole's and Leonora's two daughters,\r\nearly displayed the striking beauty and great qualities that\r\ndistinguished her in after-years. Her regular features and delicate\r\ncolouring, her ready wit and gracious manners, charmed all the visitors\r\nto Ferrara. The letters of princes and ambassadors were full of her\r\npraises. The Mantuan envoy who was sent to Ferrara in 1480, to arrange\r\nthe terms of the marriage contract, was amazed at the little bride's\r\nprecocity. The six-year-old child not only danced charmingly before him,\r\nbut conversed with a grace and intelligence which seemed to him little\r\nshort of miraculous. All her teachers told the same story. Whatever\r\nMadonna Isabella did was well done. Her quickness in learning, her\r\nmarvellous memory, and application to her studies were the theme of\r\nevery one at court. She was the apple of her father's eye, her mother's\r\nmost sweet and cherished companion--\"_la mia carissima e dolce figliuola\r\nsopra altre_.\" When she married and left home for Mantua, her poor old\r\ntutor shed tears at the loss of his favourite pupil, and wandered\r\nthrough the castle recalling her every word and movement; while for\r\nweeks the good duchess could not bear to enter the room or open the\r\nwindows of the room which her darling child had occupied, and which was\r\nnow left empty and desolate.\r\n\r\nBy the side of this brilliant creature, her younger sister, the little\r\nBeatrice, passed comparatively unnoticed. Her name is scarcely ever\r\nmentioned in the records of the period. Yet she was only a year younger\r\nthan Isabella, and if all had gone well, the double wedding of the two\r\nsisters was to have been celebrated at the same time in February, 1490.\r\nBut Lodovico Sforza had shown no inclination to press the matter. He\r\nprofessed the most cordial friendship for the Duke of Ferrara, who had\r\nevery reason to be grateful for his help in the Venetian wars, and\r\nentertained Ercole magnificently when, in 1487, he paid a visit to\r\nMilan. But when the question of her marriage was mooted, he made excuses\r\nand suggested further delay. The extreme youth of the bride, the urgency\r\nof affairs of state, were all brought forward as excellent reasons for\r\nputting off the marriage until a more convenient season. During the ten\r\nyears after his return to Milan, Lodovico's time and thoughts had been\r\nfully occupied. The internal as well as the external affairs of his\r\nstate, the attacks of public enemies and private foes, alike demanded\r\nhis whole energies. But so far Fortune had favoured him in a wonderful\r\nway. An attempt was made by Duchess Bona's confessor to assassinate him\r\non the steps of Saint Ambrogio at Christmas, 1485, but fortunately\r\nfailed, because that day Lodovico entered the church by a side door to\r\navoid the crowd. The sympathy excited by this cowardly attempt on his\r\nlife, and by his recovery from a dangerous illness which brought him to\r\nthe point of death, helped to strengthen his position at home, while\r\ncomplete success attended his arms and diplomacy. On the one hand,\r\nVenice was forced to accept his terms of peace; on the other, Genoa,\r\nsorely pressed by her old rival Florence, appealed to the Regent of\r\nMilan for assistance, and once more recognized the supremacy of Gian\r\nGaleazzo Sforza. A cardinal's hat was obtained for Ascanio Sforza, in\r\nwhom Lodovico found an able and loyal supporter both in Rome and Milan.\r\nAnd when, in 1488, Lodovico's niece, Caterina Sforza, turned to him for\r\nhelp against the conspirators who had murdered her husband and seized\r\nthe Rocca of Forli, a Milanese army under young Galeazzo di Sanseverino\r\nwas promptly sent to her assistance. The citadel was besieged and\r\ncaptured, and the rights of Caterina and her son Ottaviano were\r\ntriumphantly vindicated. Thus on every side the house of Sforza was\r\nrestored to its former dignity, and the great Condottiere's name was\r\nrespected and honoured. The Milanese once more enjoyed a period of peace\r\nand prosperity, and Lodovico was able to devote himself to his favourite\r\npursuits, the encouragement of learning and of the fine arts. Even at\r\nthe most anxious and busiest times, in the midst of the war with Venice\r\nand the negotiations for the league against her, Lodovico had found time\r\nto carry on his brother's schemes for the decoration of the Castello of\r\nMilan, and to help forward the works of the Duomo and the Certosa of\r\nPavia. He had begun to rebuild the palace of Vigevano on a splendid\r\nscale, and had set on foot a vast system of irrigation for the\r\nimprovement of the ducal estates. Besides encouraging the rising school\r\nof native artists, he had invited the best foreign architects and\r\npainters, sculptors and poets, to his court. Already Bramante of Urbino\r\nwas the chief architect at the ducal court, and now Lorenzo de' Medici\r\nsent a young Florentine master to Milan who played the lute divinely,\r\nand whose varied talents might prove serviceable to his friend Lodovico.\r\nSo Leonardo da Vinci came to the court of the Moro, and found in him so\r\ngenial and understanding a patron, so generous and kindly a friend, that\r\nhe settled at Milan, and remained in the duke's service for the next\r\nsixteen years. Thus Lodovico Sforza had shown himself a wise and\r\nexcellent regent, and had earned the gratitude of both prince and\r\npeople, while the young duke in whose name he governed was growing up to\r\nman's estate. From his birth Gian Galeazzo had been a frail and sickly\r\nchild, subject to constant feverish attacks, and in the year 1483 was so\r\ndangerously ill that at one moment his doctors despaired of his\r\nrecovery. As he grew older, it became plain that his mind was as feeble\r\nas his body. He was utterly incapable of applying himself to serious\r\nbusiness, far less of administering state affairs. His whole days were\r\nspent in idleness and pleasure, in hunting and drinking. Horses and dogs\r\nwere the only objects in which he took any interest. Under these\r\ncircumstances, it became plain that Lodovico would remain the actual\r\nruler of Milan even though his nephew bore the title of duke. All\r\noutward respect was paid to Gian Galeazzo; he lived in great state, with\r\na household and officers of his own, and was surrounded by regal pomp on\r\npublic occasions. Clad in ducal robes, he appeared seated on a throne\r\nerected in front of the Duomo when the Genoese patricians arrived at\r\nMilan, and received their homage as duke of the principality of Genoa.\r\nHis brother Ermes, his sisters Bianca and Anna, shared his state, and\r\nwhen Bianca's betrothed husband the young prince of Savoy died, she was\r\nformally affianced in the Duomo to the eldest son of Matthias Corvinus,\r\nKing of Hungary. But the real sovereign of Milan was Lodovico Duke of\r\nBari. Here and there a jealous or discontented Milanese nobleman might\r\ngrumble, but the majority of the duke's subjects felt that in these\r\ntroublous days a strong hand was needed at the helm, and knew that they\r\nhad this strong man in the Moro.\r\n\r\nBy degrees Lodovico removed those governors of cities and fortresses\r\nwhose loyalty he had reason to suspect, and replaced them by\r\nconfidential servants. Filippo Eustachio, captain of the Castello of\r\nMilan, a brave and honest man, Corio tells us, who had refused to yield\r\nup the keys of the Rocca to Bona's minion, but whose brothers had been\r\nimplicated in the plot against Lodovico's life, was one day arrested by\r\nthe duke's orders, and imprisoned at Abbiategrasso; he was afterwards\r\nreleased, no evidence of his guilt being produced, but his post was\r\nfilled by one of the Moro's servants. Chief among the trusted captains\r\nin whom Lodovico placed his confidence were the Sanseverini brothers, \"i\r\ngran Sanseverini,\" as they were called in the court poet's verses, as\r\nmuch on account of their great strength and stature as of the exalted\r\nposition which they held at the Milanese court. Their father, that\r\nturbulent soldier Roberto, after making three desperate attempts to\r\nunseat the prince whose return to power he had effected, and being three\r\ntimes proclaimed a rebel and outlaw at Milan, had taken service under\r\nPope Innocent VIII. and led the campaign against Alfonso of Calabria, as\r\nCaptain-general of the Church. But before long he quarrelled with the\r\nPope and returned to the service of the Venetian Republic, until in\r\nAugust, 1486, at the age of seventy, he fell fighting with heroic valour\r\nagainst the Imperialists in the battle of Trent. Of his twelve sons,\r\nfour entered the service of their kinsman, Lodovico Sforza, and rose to\r\nhigh honour and dignity. All of them were mighty men of valour like\r\ntheir father before them, while a fifth, Cardinal Federigo, was to prove\r\na staunch adherent of the Sforzas in days to come. He inherited the\r\ngiant stature as well as the martial tastes of his family, and at the\r\nconsecration of Pope Alexander VI. is said to have lifted Borgia in his\r\narms and placed him on the high altar. The eldest of the brothers,\r\nGiovanni Francesco, Count of Caiazzo, succeeded to his father's estates\r\nin Calabria, but lived at Milan, and became one of Lodovico's chief\r\ncaptains. Both Gaspare--the gallant soldier known by his surname of\r\nCaptain Fracassa--and Antonio Maria, the husband of the fair and learned\r\nMargherita Pia of Carpi, a beloved friend and cousin of the Este\r\nprincesses, were prominent figures at the Milanese court. But the most\r\nfamous and popular of all the brothers was Galeazzo. This brilliant and\r\naccomplished cavalier, who was to play so great a part at the Milanese\r\ncourt, early attracted the notice of Lodovico by his personal charm and\r\nrare skill in knightly exercises. As a rider and jouster, he was without\r\na rival. Wherever he entered the lists, at Milan or Venice, at Ferrara\r\nor Urbino, he invariably carried off the prize, and was proclaimed\r\nvictor in the games. And to this prowess in courtly exercises he joined\r\na love of art and learning which especially commended him to the Moro.\r\nUnlike his brother Captain Fracassa, who refused Caterina Sforza's\r\ninvitation to join in dance and song, saying that war was his trade and\r\nhe sought no other, Galeazzo was a model of courtesy and grace. All fair\r\nladies had a smile for him. Isabella d'Este and Elisabetta Gonzaga\r\nhonoured him with their friendship, and Beatrice d'Este found in him the\r\ntruest of friends and best of servants. Three kings of France, Charles\r\nVIII., Louis XII., and Francis I., singled him out for special\r\ndistinction, and after enjoying the highest honour at Lodovico Sforza's\r\ncourt, he lived to become Grand Ecuyer of France in the next century.\r\nFrench Italian chroniclers alike own the fascination of his handsome\r\npresence and extol the _gentilezza_ of this very perfect knight.\r\nLeonardo da Vinci and Luca Pacioli the mathematician had in him a noble,\r\ngenerous patron, and Baldassare Castiglione, who knew him in his youth\r\nat Milan, has enshrined his memory in the pages of his \"Cortigiano.\" It\r\nwas this rare union of qualities which endeared the young Sanseverino to\r\nthe Moro, who chose him for his intimate friend and companion. On his\r\nreturn from his successful campaign against the Forli rebels, Lodovico\r\nappointed him Captain-general of the Milanese armies, a step which\r\nnaturally excited great jealousy among his rivals, and mortally wounded\r\nthe pride of Messer Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, an older captain in the same\r\nservice. Short of stature and rude of speech, with the big nose and\r\nrugged features that are familiar to us in Caradosso's medal, this able\r\nsoldier presented a curious contrast to the brilliant and courtly Messer\r\nGaleazzo, whose rival he remained to the end of his life. Yet he knew\r\nhow to appreciate genius, and after his triumphant return to Milan in\r\n1499, employed Leonardo to paint his portrait and design his tomb.\r\nAlthough a Guelph by birth, Trivulzio, up to this time, had been one of\r\nLodovico's most active supporters. But when he saw a younger rival\r\npreferred to him, he left Milan in disgust and retired to Naples, where\r\nhe entered King Ferrante's service, and became from that time a bitter\r\nenemy of the Sforza's. Meanwhile the Moro loaded his favourite Galeazzo\r\nwith honours and rewards. He gave him the fine estate of Castelnuovo in\r\nthe Tortonese, which had once belonged to his father, the great\r\nCondottiere Roberto, as well as a house in Pavia near the church of San\r\nFrancesco and a palace in Milan, near the Porta Vercellina, and allowed\r\nhim to build a villa and extensive stables in the park of the Castello.\r\nAs a last and crowning honour, he bestowed upon this fortunate youth the\r\nhand of his illegitimate daughter Bianca, a beautiful and attractive\r\nchild to whom he was fondly attached. Of her mother we have no certain\r\nknowledge, but she is generally supposed to have been some mistress of\r\nlow origin, and Bianca herself is described by a contemporary writer as\r\n\"_figlia ex pellice nata_.\" The wedding was solemnized with great\r\nsplendour in the chapel of the Castello di Pavia, on the last day of the\r\nyear 1489, but the young princess was still a child, and Galeazzo had to\r\nwait five years before he took home his bride. After his marriage he\r\nadopted the name of Sforza Visconti, and was treated by Lodovico as a\r\nmember of his family.\r\n\r\nAnother wedding which took place about this time was that of the young\r\nduke, Gian Galeazzo. He had already entered his twentieth year, and the\r\nPrincess Isabella of Aragon, to whom he had been betrothed in his\r\nfather's lifetime, was turned eighteen, so that the marriage could no\r\nlonger be delayed. In November, 1488, his brother Ermes was sent to\r\nNaples with a suite of four hundred persons, who entered King Ferrante's\r\ncapital sumptuously arrayed in silk brocade, and amazed even his\r\nluxurious courtiers by the splendour of their gold chains and jewelled\r\nplumes. At least Isabella's father, Alfonso, who had little love for his\r\nbrother-in-law, and had already found Lodovico more than a match for his\r\nown cunning, could not complain that his daughter had not been\r\nhonourably treated. After a rough passage in the depth of winter, which\r\nsorely tried the patience of the court poet Bellincioni, who was a\r\nmember of the Milanese suite, the bride landed on the 7th of February,\r\nand travelled by land to Genoa and Tortona. There her bridegroom, the\r\nyoung Duke of Milan, was awaiting her, with his uncle Lodovico, and a\r\nbanquet as memorable for ingenuity as for splendour was given in her\r\nhonour. Each course was introduced by some mythological personage. Jason\r\nappeared with the golden fleece, Phoebus Apollo brought in a calf stolen\r\nfrom the herds of Admetus, Diana led Actæon in the form of a stag,\r\nAtalanta followed with the wild boar of Calydon, Iris came with a\r\npeacock from the car of Juno, and Orpheus carried in the birds whom he\r\nhad charmed with his lute. Hebe poured out the wines, Vertumnus and\r\nPomona handed round apples and grapes, Thetis and her sea-nymphs brought\r\nevery variety of fish, and shepherds crowned with chaplets of ivy\r\narrived from the hills of Arcady, bearing jars of milk and honey to the\r\nfestive board. At Milan fresh wonders were awaiting the bridal pair. The\r\ncourt of the Castello was hung with blue drapery and wreaths of laurel\r\nand ivy, above which the ducal arms, designed in antique style, were\r\nseen, supported by figures of Centaurs. Under a seven-columned portico\r\nadorned with crimson-and-gold hangings, the duke's sister, Bianca Maria\r\nSforza, received the bride, and led her to a richly decorated chamber in\r\nthe Camera della Torre. On the following day the wedding was solemnized\r\nwith great pomp in the Duomo. The duke and duchess, clad in white,\r\nwalked hand-in-hand up the great aisles of the church, and finally, were\r\nescorted to the rooms prepared for them in the Rocca, and after the\r\nMilanese fashion, hung with pure white satin. But the most memorable\r\npart of the wedding festivities, and that to which Lodovico himself\r\ndevoted especial attention, was the performance of an operetta composed\r\nby the court poet Bellincioni for the occasion. \"It was called _Il\r\nParadiso_\" adds the chronicler to whom we owe these details, \"because\r\nMaestro Leonardo Vinci, the Florentine, had with great art and ingenuity\r\nfabricated a paradise or celestial sphere, in which the seven planets\r\nwere represented by actors in costumes similar to those described by\r\nthose poets of old, who each in turn spoke the praise of Duchess\r\nIsabella.\"\r\n\r\nThe festivities were interrupted by the illness of the young duke, who\r\nwas so much exhausted by the fatigues of these successive\r\nentertainments, that he was unable to leave his bed for some weeks. But\r\nin the following summer two splendid tournaments were held at Pavia, at\r\nwhich Messer Galeazzo, as Sanseverino is always styled in Milanese\r\nannals, appeared with twenty followers in golden armour, mounted on\r\nchargers with gold trappings and harness, and, having unhorsed no less\r\nthan nineteen of his opponents, bore off the first prize, a length of\r\ncostly silver brocade. The duke and duchess were present with their\r\nwhole court, but the Ferrarese ambassador remarked that the crowd all\r\nshouted, \"Moro! Moro!\" and that Signor Lodovico was by far the most\r\npopular personage with the citizens of Pavia.\r\n\r\n\"He is a great man, and intends to be what he is in fact\r\nalready--everything!\" he wrote in his despatches to Ferrara. \"And yet\r\nwho knows? In a short time he may be nobody.\"\r\n\r\nGian Galeazzo, however, showed no signs of interfering with his uncle in\r\nthe management of public affairs. On the contrary, he gave full rein to\r\nhis pleasure-loving tastes, seldom came to Milan, and spent his days at\r\nPavia or Vigevano in the company of his young wife and a few favourites.\r\nDuchess Isabella, as time showed, was a woman of strong character and\r\ndeep feeling, but she never seemed to have acquired any influence over\r\nher feeble husband, and found herself powerless to arouse him to any\r\nsense of his position, \"_La dicte fille_\" says Commines, \"_etoit fort\r\ncourageuse et eut volontier donné crédit à son mary, si elle eut pu,\r\nmais il n'etoit guère saige et révélait ce qu'elle lui disait_.\"\r\nLodovico treated both his nephew and niece with the utmost respect, and\r\ndiscussed the situation freely with the Florentine ambassador\r\nPandolfini, saying that King Ferrante's envoy had lately gone so far as\r\nto suggest that, since this young man could never rule for himself, his\r\nuncle might as well assume the title, as well as the cares, of the head\r\nof the state. But this, Lodovico declared, was a crime of which he would\r\nnever be guilty. \"If I were to attempt such a thing,\" he exclaimed, \"I\r\nshould be infamous in the eyes of the whole world!\"\r\n\r\nFor the present the sense of power, the knowledge that he was the actual\r\nruler, sufficed him, and, as the King of Naples himself recognized, no\r\none could have governed Milan more wisely or well than Lodovico did in\r\nhis nephew's name. The birth of Duchess Isabella's son, in December,\r\n1490, may have been a blow to his hopes. But the happy event was\r\ncelebrated with due rejoicings, the costly presents from the city of\r\nMilan and court officials were displayed in the Castello, and the infant\r\nheir of the house of Sforza received the name of his renowned\r\ngreat-grandfather, Francesco, together with the title of Count of Pavia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lodovico felt that it was time to think of his own marriage,\r\nand to keep the troth which he had pledged to the child-princess of\r\nEste. His actions, as he well knew, were narrowly watched at the court\r\nof Ferrara. Duchess Leonora was beginning to feel anxious about her\r\ndaughter's future, and the marriage of Anna Sforza with young Alfonso\r\nd'Este had also to be arranged. Accordingly in May, 1489, when the Duke\r\nof Milan's wedding was safely over, the Ferrarese envoy Giacomo Trotti\r\nwas sent back to his master duly acquainted with Signor Lodovico's\r\nwishes and intentions respecting these important matters.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, the articles of the marriage contract were finally\r\ndrawn up and signed at the Castello of Ferrara. They were on the same\r\nbasis as the marriage treaties which had lately been drawn up between\r\nthe Marquis Mantua and Isabella d'Este and the Duke and Duchess of\r\nMilan. Lodovico was to receive 40,000 gold crowns and 2000 more in\r\njewels as Beatrice's portion. A sum equal to three-parts of the bride's\r\ndower was to be chargeable on the goods and lands of Signor Lodovico. If\r\nthe most illustrious Madonna were to die without children, this dowry\r\nwas to be returned, as was stipulated in the case of the Duchess of\r\nMilan. With regard to the choice and arrangement of the bride's\r\nhousehold, and the number of her women, Lodovico was content to leave\r\nall particulars to the Duke and Duchess of Ferrara, trusting to their\r\ngoodness and prudence to settle all these matters on a scale suitable to\r\nthe birth and rank of a princess of this illustrious house. But he\r\nespecially begged Duke Ercole to see that Madonna Beatrice was well\r\nsupplied with clothes and other necessary articles of toilet fitting the\r\nposition which she would occupy at Milan as wife of the Duke of Bari and\r\nRegent of the State. Last of all, the date of the marriage was\r\npositively fixed for the month of May, 1490, Lodovico promising to\r\ndefray all the expenses of the wedding festivities. At the same time it\r\nwas also decided that Madonna Anna's marriage should take place in July,\r\n1490, by which time Signor Alfonso would have completed his fourteenth\r\nyear, and the sum due to Messer Lodovico for Beatrice's dowry was to be\r\ndeducted from that of his niece, who, as a princess of Milan, was to\r\nreceive a portion of 100,000 crowns.\r\n\r\nSo Beatrice d'Este's wedding-day was at length fixed, and Duchess\r\nLeonora rejoiced in the happy prospect of seeing both her daughters\r\nmarried in the course of the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMarriage of Isabella d'Este--Lodovico puts off his wedding--Cecilia\r\nGallerani--Her portrait by Leonardo da Vinci--Mission of Galeazzo\r\nVisconti to Ferrara--Preparations for Beatrice's wedding--Cristoforo\r\nRomano's bust--Duchess Leonora and her daughters travel to Piacenza and\r\nPavia--Their reception at Pavia by Lodovico.\r\n\r\n1490-1491\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young Marquis of Mantua, Gian Francesco Gonzaga, had proved himself\r\na more ardent lover than Lodovico Sforza. He frequently exchanged\r\nletters and compliments with his youthful bride, or sent Isabella\r\npresents and verses written in her honour by Mantuan poets. After his\r\nfather's death in 1484, he visited Mantua, and brought Duchess Leonora a\r\nMadonna painted by the hand of the great Paduan master, Andrea Mantegna,\r\nthe court painter of the Gonzagas. In the autumn of the same year,\r\nLeonora took her daughter to Mantua for a short visit, where she first\r\nmet Gian Francesco's sister, Elizabeth Duchess of Urbino, who was to\r\nbecome her dearest friend and constant companion in the early days of\r\nher married life. Four years afterwards, the same Elizabeth, the\r\npeerless Duchess of Castiglione and Bembo's adoration, stopped at\r\nFerrara on her wedding journey to her new home of Urbino, and received\r\nan affectionate welcome from Leonora and her daughters. The duchess, she\r\nwrote, treated her as a mother, while in the Marchesana she had already\r\nfound a loving sister and friend. On the 11th of February, 1490,\r\nIsabella's own wedding was celebrated at Ferrara, and the following\r\nmorning the bride rode through the streets of the city, with the Duke of\r\nUrbino on her right and the Ambassador of Naples on her left hand. On\r\nthe 12th, the bride set out for Mantua, travelling by water up the\r\nriver Po in a stately bucentaur presented to Isabella by Duke Ercole,\r\nadorned with rich carving and gilding. Her parents and three brothers,\r\nAlfonso, Ferrante, and the boy Ippolito, afterwards well known as\r\nAriosto's patron, Cardinal d'Este, with a large suite, accompanied her\r\nto the gates of Mantua, where a magnificent reception awaited her. The\r\nyoung marquis had made great preparations to welcome his bride, and,\r\nafter the fashion of the days, had borrowed gold and silver plate,\r\ncarpets, and hangings from all his friends and relations, including the\r\nfamous tapestries of the Trojan war, which were the chief ornaments of\r\nthe palace of Urbino. The _fêtes_ passed off brilliantly, the crowds\r\nwhich assembled in the streets of Mantua were enormous, and the utmost\r\nenthusiasm was excited by the youth and loveliness of the bride. The\r\nonly drawback was the absence of Mantegna, whom Pope Innocent had\r\ndetained in Rome, in spite of his master's urgent request that the\r\npainter might return in time to arrange the wedding festivities.\r\n\r\nThe void which Isabella left in her old home was keenly felt alike by\r\nher mother and sister. The duchess could not console herself for her\r\ndaughter's absence, and after spending a delightful week with her\r\nsister-in-law Elizabeth on the lake of Garda, among the lemon-groves and\r\ngardens of those sunny shores, Isabella and her husband returned to\r\nFerrara in April. Here she found that Beatrice's marriage had been again\r\nput off by Signor Lodovico's wish until the summer, and Isabella agreed\r\nto return to Ferrara early in July, and accompany her mother and sister\r\nto Milan. But when July came and the young marchioness reached Ferrara,\r\nshe found to her surprise that all these plans had been suddenly\r\nchanged. Lodovico had once more found it impossible to keep his\r\nengagement, and pleaded urgent public affairs and unavoidable pressure\r\nof business to excuse his apparent apathy. This time the duke and\r\nduchess were seriously annoyed, and began to doubt if Lodovico ever\r\nintended to wed their daughter. The question was gravely discussed\r\nduring Isabella's visit, and a messenger from Milan suddenly reached\r\nFerrara late one evening. It was no other than Messer Galeazzo Visconti,\r\none of Lodovico's most trusted envoys, who had ridden from Milan in\r\ngreat haste, with letters from his lord. The contents of these letters\r\nremained unknown. One thing only was clear: they gave the duke great\r\ndissatisfaction. And Messer Galeazzo departed the next day, as quickly\r\nas he came. \"I have tried in vain,\" wrote Benedetto Capilupi, the\r\nMarquis of Mantua's agent at Ferrara, \"to discover the reason of all\r\nthese disturbances. Every one is out of temper, and the duke seems to be\r\nvery much displeased. M. Galeazzo has left suddenly.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella returned to join her husband at Mantua, leaving affairs in this\r\nunsatisfactory state. Beatrice's wedding seemed further off than ever,\r\nand doubts as to her union with Signor Lodovico began to be openly\r\nexpressed. It was well known at Ferrara, where everything that happened\r\nat the court of Milan was minutely reported to Duke Ercole by his\r\nfaithful envoy, Giacomo Trotti, that Lodovico Sforza had a mistress to\r\nwhom he was fondly attached, and whom he had for many years past treated\r\nwith the respect and honour due to a wife. This was Cecilia Gallerani,\r\nafterwards the wife of Count Lodovico Bergamini, a young Milanese lady\r\nof noble birth, as distinguished for her learning as for her beauty. She\r\nspoke and wrote Latin fluently, composed sonnets in Italian, and\r\ndelivered Latin orations to the theologians and philosophers who met at\r\nher house. Contemporary writings abound in allusions to the rare virtues\r\nand learning of \"la bella Gallerani,\" the Sappho of modern times.\r\nScaligero wrote epigrams in her honour, Ortensio Lando classes her with\r\nIsabella d'Este and Vittoria Colonna among the most cultured women of\r\nthe age. The novelist Matteo Bandello, himself a friar of the Dominican\r\nconvent of S. Maria delle Grazie at Milan, is never tired of singing\r\nCecilia's praises, and of describing the pleasant company who met at the\r\ncountess's palace in Milan or at her villa near Cremona. There, he tells\r\nus, all the finest wits, all the most distinguished strangers in Milan\r\nassemble, and you may hear valiant captains reasoning with doctors and\r\nphilosophers, or look at paintings and designs by living artists and\r\narchitects, and listen to the playing and singing of the best musicians.\r\nAs a young girl, Cecilia's charms captured the heart of the Moro, who,\r\nas early as 1481, bestowed the estate of Saronno, which he had inherited\r\nfrom his brother Sforza, upon her by a deed of gift, in which he\r\nextolled her learning and excellence, and at the same time recalled the\r\nmerits and services of her ancestors. Soon after Leonardo da Vinci's\r\narrival in Milan, Lodovico employed him to paint the portrait of his\r\nfair young mistress, and we have more than one proof of the admiration\r\nwhich the Florentine master's work excited among his contemporaries. In\r\nthe _Rime_ of the court-poet, Bellincioni, we find the following sonnet\r\nevidently inspired by this picture and bearing the inscription: \"On the\r\nportrait of Madonna Cecilia, painted by Maestro Leonardo.\" The poet\r\nseeks to appease Dame Nature's wrath at the sight of this portrait, in\r\nwhich the painter has represented the lovely maiden \"listening, not\r\nspeaking,\" but so full of life and radiance, that the sun's beams grow\r\ndim before the brightness of her eyes. And instead of envying art, he\r\nbids her rejoice that this living image of so beautiful a form will be\r\nhanded down to future ages, and give thanks to Lodovico's wisdom and\r\nLeonardo's genius for having preserved this fair face to be the joy and\r\nwonder of posterity. \"Thine, O Nature,\" he cries, \"is the honour! the\r\nmore living and beautiful Cecilia shall appear in the eyes of\r\ngenerations to come, the greater will be thy glory! For long as the\r\nworld endures, all who see her face will recognize in Leonardo's work\r\nthe close union of Art and Nature.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Che lei vedrà, così ben che sia tardo,\r\n    Vederla viva, dirà: basti ad noi\r\n    Comprender or quel che è natura et arte.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of April, 1498, a year after Beatrice d'Este's death, her\r\nsister the Marchioness Isabella herself wrote to the Countess Bergamini\r\nfrom Mantua, begging her for the loan of the portrait which Leonardo had\r\npainted of her and which she had formerly seen in Milan. \"Having to-day\r\nseen some fine portraits by the hand of Giovanni Bellini, we began to\r\ndiscuss the works of Leonardo, and wished we could compare them with\r\nthese paintings. And since we remember that he painted your likeness; we\r\nbeg you to be so good as to send us your portrait by this messenger whom\r\nwe have despatched on horseback, so that we may not only be able to\r\ncompare the works of the two masters, but may also have the pleasure of\r\nseeing your face again. The picture shall be returned to you\r\nafterwards, with our most grateful thanks for your kindness, and\r\nassuring you of our own readiness to oblige you to the utmost of our\r\npower, etc.\r\n\r\n                                                     \"ISABELLA D'ESTE.\r\n\r\nFrom Mantua.\"\r\n\r\nCecilia sent the precious picture by the courier to Mantua, with the\r\nfollowing note in reply:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCELLENT MADONNA AND VERY DEAR LADY,\r\n\r\n\"I have read your Highness's letter, and since you wish to see my\r\nportrait I send it without delay, and would send it with even greater\r\npleasure if it were more like me. But your Highness must not think this\r\nproceeds from any defect in the _Maestro_ himself, for indeed I do not\r\nbelieve there is another painter equal to him in the world, but merely\r\nbecause the portrait was painted when I was still at so young and\r\nimperfect an age. Since then I have changed altogether, so much so that\r\nif you saw the picture and myself together, you would never dream it\r\ncould be meant for me! All the same, your Highness will, I hope, accept\r\nthis proof of my good-will, and believe that I am ready and anxious to\r\ngratify your wishes, not only in respect to the portrait, but in any\r\nother way that I can, since I am ever Your Highness's most devoted slave\r\nand commend myself to you a thousand times.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your Highness's servant,\r\n                                        CECILIA VISCONTA BERGAMINA,[3]\r\n\r\nFrom Milan, the 29th of April, 1498.\"\r\n\r\nSince that day when the great Florentine first painted her, Cecilia\r\nGallerani had developed into a handsome matron, and as Lodovico Sforza's\r\nrecognized mistress she enjoyed a position of great honour at court. For\r\nsome years she occupied a suite of rooms in the Castello of Milan, where\r\nher lover constantly visited her and took the greatest delight in her\r\ncompany. His passion for this beautiful and intellectual woman only\r\nseemed to increase 108 with years. She had already borne him one son,\r\nthe Leone, whom he was known to love so well that his courtiers did not\r\ndare tell him the sad news when the child died suddenly in 1487. The\r\nDuke of Bari, it was even said, intended ere long to make her his lawful\r\nwife, and thus to render her future issue legitimate.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it can hardly be wondered if Lodovico Sforza\r\nshowed some reluctance in keeping the troth which he had plighted to the\r\nyoung princess of Este, while Duke Ercole's vexation was the more\r\npardonable. For a time it seemed as if a rupture between the two houses\r\nwas inevitable, and all thought of a union between them must be\r\nabandoned. But soon a change came over Il Moro's dream. The difficulties\r\nin the way of a closer union with Cecilia Gallerani were great, and must\r\ninvariably lead to jealousies and quarrels of a serious order. His own\r\nposition in Milan would be endangered, and fresh hindrances placed in\r\nthe way of his future designs. At the same time, the alliances with\r\nFerrara and Mantua were both of great importance to the state, and could\r\nnot be lightly thrown away. So he determined to sacrifice his\r\ninclinations to political exigencies, and make Beatrice d'Este his wife.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, at the end of August he sent another ambassador, Francesco\r\nda Casate, to Ferrara with a magnificent gift for his bride, in the\r\nshape of a necklace of large pearls set in gold flowers, with a very\r\nfine pear-shaped pendant of rubies, pearls, and emeralds. This costly\r\njewel was duly presented to Beatrice in the name of her affianced\r\nhusband, and Duchess Leonora wrote forthwith to give her daughter\r\nIsabella the good news, informing her that Signor Lodovico hoped she\r\nwould accompany her mother and sister to Milan that autumn for the\r\nwedding. The young marchioness was delighted to accept this invitation,\r\nand in the course of a few days she paid another visit to Ferrara, to\r\nassist in the preparations for her sister's marriage. Messer Galeazzo\r\nVisconti was sent there again to learn the duke and duchess's pleasure\r\nas to their daughter's journey, and, after making the final\r\narrangements, left Ferrara on the 26th of November. The bride's\r\ndeparture was fixed for the last day of the year, and the wedding, it\r\nwas decided, should take place in the chapel of the Castello of Pavia on\r\nthe 16th of January.\r\n\r\nIsabella hurried to Mantua to buy horses and clothes, jewels and plate\r\nfor her journey, and announced her intention of taking upwards of one\r\nhundred persons in her suite, with ninety horses and trumpeters.\r\nAfterwards, however, she reduced the number to fifty persons and thirty\r\nhorses at the request of Lodovico, who begged her to bring as few\r\nattendants as possible, owing to the large number of guests who were\r\nexpected at Milan. Her husband, the Marquis Gianfrancesco, had naturally\r\nbeen included in the invitation, but as a close ally of the Venetians he\r\ndid not think it politic to appear at the wedding of Lodovico Sforza.\r\nThe Signory of Venice were known to look coldly on this alliance between\r\nFerrara and Milan, and entertained the deepest distrust of Lodovico's\r\npolicy. So Isabella decided to join her mother and sister on their\r\njourney up the river, and proceed with them to Pavia and ultimately to\r\nMilan. Meanwhile another emissary from Milan had arrived at Ferrara.\r\nThis was the young sculptor, Cristoforo Romano, who was sent to Signor\r\nLodovico to carve a bust-portrait of his bride before she left her\r\nfather's home. The son of a Pisan sculptor who had settled in Rome,\r\nCristoforo's genius had attracted attention when he was quite a boy, and\r\nhe had been sent to Milan by Cardinal Ascanio Sforza. The young Roman\r\nmaster was one of those brilliant and versatile artists who especially\r\ncommended themselves to Lodovico. He sang and played the lute admirably,\r\nwhile his literary tastes made him the intimate friend of Bembo and\r\nCastiglione, and a great favourite with the cultured princesses of\r\nMantua and Urbino. He takes a leading part in the dialogues of the\r\nCortigiano, and is frequently mentioned as worthy to rank with Michael\r\nAngelo, whose fame he might have rivalled had he not suffered from\r\ncontinual ill health. As it is, the few works which he left behind him\r\nare marked with singular grace and refinement. His bust of Beatrice, now\r\nin the Louvre, where for many years it passed as the work of Leonardo,\r\nis at once remarkable for its truth and charm. The somewhat irregular\r\nfeatures of the maiden of fifteen years are admirably given, the\r\nroundness of her cheeks, the pouting lips and slightly _retroussé_ nose,\r\nand the curling locks are faithfully represented; yet we realize the\r\nforce of character that lies under this soft, child-like face, and the\r\nfrank joyousness which made her so attractive. Each stray lock of hair\r\nis rendered with delicate accuracy, the brocaded bodice of her gown and\r\nthe scarf lightly thrown over her shoulders are elaborately adorned with\r\nthe triangular diamond and other favourite devices of the house of Este.\r\nThe quaint figure of the two hands holding a veil, from which\r\nfertilizing dust falls on the open flower, is supposed to be an emblem\r\nof marriage, and is said to signify that Beatrice was already an\r\naffianced bride. But since the words \"Herculis filiæ\" are cut in the\r\nmarble, it is plain that Cristoforo carved the bust while the young\r\nduchess was still in her father's home, and probably took it home with\r\nhim that autumn to Milan.\r\n\r\nThat year the winter set in with unusual severity. The bitter frost and\r\ncold which man and beast endured that January were long remembered, both\r\nin Mantua and Ferrara. On Christmas night it began to snow, and so heavy\r\nand continuous was the fall, that by noon on the next day the snow lay\r\nthree feet deep in front of the Vescovado, or Bishop's house, opposite\r\nthe Este palace. The Po was frozen over, and the ice on the river never\r\nthawed until the first week in February, while the snow lasted till the\r\n12th of March, and some patches might still be seen in the streets of\r\nFerrara on the 20th of that month.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these unwonted rigours, the wedding-party set out on\r\ntheir long journey. The royal brides of these days seem to have been\r\nsingularly unlucky in the matter of weather. For one thing, they always\r\ntravelled in the depths of winter. Elizabeth Gonzaga almost died of\r\nexhaustion after the sufferings of her journey from Mantua to Urbino in\r\na violent tempest, which kept her ship tossing on the waves of the Po\r\nfor several days and nights. The fleet which conveyed Isabella and her\r\nescort from Naples to Leghorn, narrowly escaped shipwreck off the coast\r\nof Tuscany. Bianca Sforza had to ride in December over the roughest\r\nroads across the Alps of the Valtellina, to join her Imperial lord at\r\nInnsbrück. And now Leonora and her daughters were called upon to brave\r\nthe terrors of an Arctic winter on their way to Milan.\r\n\r\n\"On the 29th of December, 1490,\" writes the diarist of Ferrara,\r\n\"Madonna Beatrice, daughter of Duke Ercole, went to Milan to marry\r\nSignor Lodovico Sforza, accompanied by her mother, Leonora Duchess of\r\nFerrara; and also by Messer Sigismondo, her uncle\"--the duke's younger\r\nbrother, Cardinal d'Este--\"and her brother, Don Alfonso, who went to\r\nbring home his bride, Madonna Anna, sister of the Duke of Milan and\r\ndaughter of Galeazzo, and he rode in a sledge because the Po was\r\nfrozen.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the party travelled in rude country carts--\"_carrette_\"--as\r\nfar as Brescello, where the Po was navigable, and they were able to\r\ncontinue their journey by water to Pavia. Here Messer Galeazzo Visconti\r\nwas awaiting them with a fleet of boats and three bucentaurs, by which\r\npompous name the rude barges in which these high-born personages travelled\r\nwere glorified. The many discomforts and the actual cold and hunger which\r\nthe Este ladies endured during the five days which they spent on board\r\nthese vessels are graphically described in a letter addressed to Isabella's\r\nhusband by her Ferrarese lady-in-waiting, Beatrice de' Contrari, after the\r\ntravellers had reached Pavia. The boat which bore the provisions for the\r\nparty was delayed by stress of weather, so that the travellers were left\r\nwith but scanty breakfast and no dinner. When at length they anchored near\r\nthe shore of Toresella at three o'clock at night, the Marchesana and her\r\nladies were in a starving condition. \"If it had not been for the timely\r\nhelp of Madonna Camilla, who sent us part of her supper from her barge, I\r\nfor one,\" writes the lively lady-in-waiting, \"should have certainly been\r\nby this time a saint in Paradise.\" As for going to bed, all wish for\r\nsleep was put out of their heads by the rocking of the ship and the\r\nuncomfortable berths, and the poor Marchesana was so cold and wretched\r\nwithout a fire that she wished herself dead, and her lady-in-waiting\r\ncould not keep back her tears. However, at length these miseries were\r\nended, Piacenza was safely reached, on the 12th of January, and the\r\nroyal ladies and their companions were hospitably entertained by Count\r\nBartolommeo Scotti, and enjoyed the luxury of warm fires and comfortable\r\nbeds!\r\n\r\n\"And now that we have arrived,\" wrote Beatrice de' Contrari to her lord,\r\nthe marquis, \"and are beginning to enjoy these weddings for the sake of\r\nwhich we have suffered so many discomforts, I am thinking seriously of\r\nmaking my last will and testament.\"[5]\r\n\r\nAfter a day's rest at Piacenza, the bridal party continued their journey\r\nup the river, and reached Pavia at half-past four on Sunday afternoon.\r\nHere Signor Lodovico was awaiting them on the banks of the river Ticino,\r\nwhich joins the Po a few hundred yards below the city, with a gallant\r\ncompany of Milanese lords and gentlemen, and himself conducted first\r\nBeatrice and then her mother and sister to the shore. Together they rode\r\non horseback over the covered bridge which spans the river, and passed\r\nthrough the long streets until they reached the goal of their journey,\r\nand entered the gates of the far-famed Castello of Pavia.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] G.

But it was a far grander and more beautiful sight in the\r\ndays when Lodovico Sforza's bride landed near the chapel on the bridge,\r\nand in the fading light of the short winter afternoon rode at his side\r\nthrough the chief streets of the old Lombard capital, or, as it was\r\nproudly called, the city of a hundred towers. On the princely cavalcade\r\nwound, amid a dense crowd of people shouting, \"_Moro! Moro!_\" up the\r\nlong Strada Nova, with its marble palaces, and newly painted loggias\r\nadorned with busts and frescoes, in front of the stately _Ateneo_ with\r\nits halls and porticoes for the different schools, which had the\r\nreputation of being the finest university in all Italy, and past the\r\nrising walls of the new Duomo which Lodovico was building on the site of\r\nthe ruined basilica of Charlemagne's time. A few months before, the\r\nrenowned Sienese architect, Francesco Martini, had arrived at Pavia on\r\nhorseback to give his advice as to the cupola of the new cathedral,\r\naccompanied by His Excellency's servant, Magistro Leonardo, the\r\nFlorentine, and a vast train of servants, and had been entertained at\r\nthe public expense. Martini had soon left again for Milan, after giving\r\nthe architect of the Duomo, Bramante's pupil Cristoforo Rocchi, the\r\nbenefit of his advice, and promising to send him a model of the cupola;\r\nbut Leonardo had remained at Pavia all the summer and autumn, turning\r\nover old manuscripts in the library of the Castello, and discussing\r\nanatomical problems with the professors and surgeons of the university,\r\nuntil a peremptory summons had reached him from the governor of the\r\nCastello at Milan, desiring him to return immediately and assist in\r\ndecorating the ball-room for the wedding _fêtes_. Another visitor, a\r\ncitizen of Beatrice's own city of Ferrara, had also been at Pavia a few\r\nmonths before--the Dominican friar, Girolamo Savonarola, who had visited\r\nthe Certosa and Castello of Pavia on his way from Brescia to preach at\r\nGenoa, before he was summoned at Pico della Mirandola's request to begin\r\nhis famous course of Lent sermons in St. Mark's of Florence. But now the\r\nduke's painter and the humble friar had both gone their separate ways,\r\nFra Girolamo to startle the scholars of the Medici circle with his\r\nthunders, and Leonardo to paint cupids in the halls of the Castello at\r\nMilan, and to resume his labours at the great equestrian statue of\r\nFrancesco Sforza, which Signor Lodovico was longing to see finished. All\r\nunconscious of their existence, the young bride of the powerful regent\r\nrode at her lord's side and entered the wide courtyard through the great\r\ngateway, under the lofty towers of the famous Castello which for over a\r\nhundred and fifty years had been the home of Viscontis and Sforzas.\r\n\r\nAfter the cold and fatigue of the long journey in this snowy winter\r\nseason, the bridal party were thankful to reach the end of their journey\r\nand to enjoy a day's rest before the wedding ceremony, which, after\r\nconsultation with Messer Ambrogio da Rosate, the chief court physician\r\nand astrologer, had been fixed for Tuesday, the 17th of January, this\r\nbeing the day of Mars, and therefore especially propitious for the\r\nmarriage of a lord, who above all things desired the birth of a son.\r\nThroughout his life Il Moro, like many of his contemporaries, had a\r\nblind belief in the stars, and placed the most implicit confidence in\r\nMesser Ambrogio, who was said to have saved his life during his\r\ndangerous illness at Vigevano three years before, and who had been\r\nlately called upon to cast the horoscope of Pope Innocent VIII. at the\r\nearnest entreaty of His Holiness. \"Maestro Ambrogio has been suddenly\r\ncalled to fly to Vigevano,\" wrote Giacomo Trotti to Ferrara one day in\r\n1489, \"because he is a professor of astrology, by which this excellent\r\nSignor orders all his actions.\" The date of Lodovico's journeys, the\r\nhour of all important court ceremonies, and even the movements of his\r\narmies in time of war, were regulated by the course of the stars. Messer\r\nAmbrogio, consequently, became a most important personage at the court\r\nof Milan. \"Without him,\" wrote Beatrice's maid of honour to the\r\nMarchioness Isabella, \"nothing can be done here.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful park and gardens at Pavia lay deep in snow, their lakes\r\nand fountains were all frozen over, but there was plenty to interest and\r\namuse the visitors within the walls of this great Castello, of which\r\nthey had heard so much, and which was said to be the grandest of royal\r\nhouses in the whole of Europe. Three or four generations of masters had\r\nbeen employed by successive Visconti dukes to rear this glorious fabric,\r\nwhich in its palmy days must have been a noble monument of Lombard\r\narchitecture. The long colonnades of low round arches went back to\r\nRomanesque days and the times of the first Visconti lords of Pavia; the\r\nGothic windows of the banqueting-hall and upper stories had been\r\nfinished in the reign of the great Giangaleazzo, and were enriched with\r\nslender marble shafts and exquisite terra-cotta mouldings similar to\r\nthose that we admire to-day in the cloisters of the Certosa. The vaulted\r\nhalls were painted with the finest ultramarine and gold, and the arms of\r\nSforzas and Viscontis, the lilies of France and the red cross of Savoy,\r\nappeared on the groined roof between planets and stars of raised gold.\r\nThe vast Sala della Palla, where the dukes and their courtiers indulged\r\nin their favourite pastime of \"pall-mall,\" which Burckhardt calls the\r\nclassic game of the Renaissance, was decorated with frescoes by the best\r\nartists of Pavia or Cremona, representing fishing and hunting scenes.\r\nPortraits of the dukes and duchesses were introduced, together with\r\nlions and tigers, wild boars and stags flying before the hounds, in the\r\nforest shades or on the open moor. The ball-room was adorned with\r\nhistoric subjects from the lives of the earlier Viscontis. The poet\r\nPetrarch, who had once filled a chair in the university, was seen\r\ndelivering an oration before the duke; and Giangaleazzo, the founder of\r\nthe Duomo of Milan and of the Certosa, was represented seated at a\r\nfestive board laden with gold and silver plate, entertaining foreign\r\nambassadors, with his armour-bearer standing at his side, and his\r\ncupbearer pouring out the wine, while huntsmen and falconers with horses\r\nand dogs awaited his pleasure. Of later date were the frescoes in the\r\nduchess's rooms, representing the marriage of Galeazzo Sforza at the\r\nFrench court and the reception of Bona of Savoy at Genoa, while the\r\npaintings which adorned the chapel had only lately been completed by\r\nVincenzo Foppa and Bonifazio da Cremona.\r\n\r\nSignor Lodovico was very proud, as he might well be, of this his\r\nancestral home, and of the famous library which he had done so much to\r\nimprove. He led his guests from room to room, and showed them all the\r\nrare and curious objects--the armoury with its store of ancient coats of\r\nmail and hauberks, of swords and helmets of ancient design, and its\r\nchoice specimens of the engraved and damascened work; the breastplates\r\nand greaves that were a _specialité_ of Milanese armourers at this\r\nperiod; the wonderful clock of copper and brass worked by wheels and\r\nweights, upon which Giovanni Dondi had spent sixteen years of ceaseless\r\nthought and toil, and which not only had a peal of bells, but a complete\r\nsolar system, showing the movement of sun, moon, and planets as set\r\nforth by Ptolemy. After Dondi's death, Duke Galeazzo had to send to\r\nParis for a clockmaker who could regulate the works of this elaborate\r\nmachine, which was so much admired by Charles V. when he visited Pavia\r\nin 1530, that he commissioned a mechanician of Cremona to make a similar\r\none for him to take back to Spain. And Messer Lodovico showed them also\r\nwhat he himself held to be his greatest treasures--the precious books\r\nadorned by exquisite miniatures from the hand of Fra Antonio da Monza\r\nand other living artists, the Sforziada and the Chant de Roland, and the\r\nrare Greek and Latin manuscripts which he had been at such infinite\r\npains to collect; the _codici_ brought from Bobbio by Giorgio Merula,\r\nand the manuscripts which Erasmo Brasca had discovered when _Il Moro_\r\nsent him to search for missing texts in the convents of the South of\r\nFrance. For Lodovico himself spared no expense and grudged no time or\r\ntrouble in order to enrich what he felt to be a great national\r\ninstitution. Two years before he had addressed a letter to the son of\r\nMatthias Corvinus, King of Hungary--the prince who was to have wedded\r\nBianca Sforza--begging him to have a rare manuscript by Festus Pompeius\r\ncopied for him, and deploring the \"decay of the knowledge of the Latin\r\ntongue in Italy, and the loss of so many priceless classical works which\r\nthe barbarians have carried away.\"\r\n\r\nThe sight of these precious and varied treasures were fully appreciated\r\nby the cultivated Duchess Leonora, who had grown up among the scholars\r\nof her royal father's academy at Naples, and by her daughter, the\r\naccomplished Marchesana Isabella, ever eager, as she says in one of her\r\nletters, to see and learn some new thing, \"_desiderosa di cosa nova_.\"\r\nAnd Signor Lodovico proved himself the most courteous and pleasant of\r\nhosts, conversing with graceful ease on a thousand subjects, and\r\ngratifying his new sister-in-law by the marked attention and courtesy\r\nwith which he treated her.\r\n\r\n\"I find myself highly honoured and caressed by Signor Lodovico,\" she\r\nwrote to her husband from Pavia; and the discerning eyes of the\r\nFerrarese ambassador, Giacomo Trotti, noticed how much pleasure His\r\nExcellency already took in the company of Madonna Beatrice and the\r\nMarchesana. On that first day which they spent together at the Castello,\r\nTrotti wrote to Duke Ercole, \"Signor Lodovico is always at his wife's\r\nside, speaking to her and watching her most attentively. And he tells me\r\nthat it would be impossible for her to give him greater pleasure or\r\nsatisfaction than she does, and never ceases to praise her.\"\r\n\r\nThe first impression which the youthful bride made on her husband was\r\nevidently favourable. By all accounts, Beatrice was a singularly lovely\r\nand fascinating child. Without the regular features and distinguished\r\nair of her sister Isabella, there was a distinct charm in her sparkling\r\ndark eyes and jet-black hair, her bright colouring and gay smile. The\r\ncontemporary chronicler Muralti describes her in his Annals as \"of\r\nyouthful age, beautiful in face, and dark in colouring, fond of\r\ninventing new costumes, and of spending day and night in song and\r\ndancing and all manner of delights.\" In these early days at Pavia and\r\nMilan there was, indeed, Trotti tells us, a certain shyness and reserve\r\nabout her that was only natural and might well be ascribed to maiden\r\nshyness and timidity, but in the freedom and gaiety of her new life this\r\nsoon gave way to the irrepressible mirth and joyousness of youthful\r\nvivacity. From the first she seems to have become sincerely attached to\r\nLodovico, who, although considerably older than herself, and already\r\nthirty-nine years of age, was a very handsome and splendid-looking man,\r\nof imposing stature and striking countenance, with courteous manners and\r\ngentle ways. And however often he may have excited her jealousy or\r\nwounded her feelings, his young wife never wavered in her love for him,\r\nbut proved, as he himself confessed, the best and most devoted of\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 17th of January, the long-delayed wedding finally took\r\nplace, in the Castello of Pavia. A small but very brilliant company was\r\nassembled that day in the ancient chapel of the Visconti. The official\r\nfestivities were to be celebrated at Milan, where the duke and duchess\r\nand their court were awaiting the bride's arrival, and the Ferrarese\r\nambassador was the only foreign envoy present at the wedding. But\r\nLodovico's personal friends and retainers mustered in force, as well as\r\nthose captains and courtiers who could claim kinship with the house of\r\nEste. Niccolo da Correggio was there, as one nearly related to both\r\nbride and bridegroom, and was universally pronounced to be the\r\nhandsomest and best dressed of all the cavaliers who were present that\r\nday. There, too, was Galeotto Prince of Mirandola, the husband of the\r\ngifted Bianca d'Este, and Rodolfo Gonzaga, the Marquis of Mantua's\r\nuncle, and, conspicuous by their lofty stature and martial air, the four\r\nSanseverino brothers.\r\n\r\nThe bride, arrayed in a white robe sown with pearls and glittering with\r\njewels, was led to the altar by the Duchess of Ferrara and Marchioness\r\nof Mantua, supported by the young Don Alfonso, his uncle Sigismondo,\r\nand a select retinue of Ferrarese courtiers and ladies. It was rumoured\r\nthat the Marquis Gianfrancesco Gonzaga had himself been seen in the\r\ncrowd assembled in the courtyard of the Castello, and, much to\r\nIsabella's surprise, Lodovico asked the marchioness, at the banquet\r\nwhich followed, if this report were true. But Isabella could only reply\r\nthat if her husband were at Pavia, she was unaware of the fact, and it\r\nwas not until the last day of the tournament at Milan that the marquis\r\nappeared in public.\r\n\r\n\"The nuptial benediction was pronounced, and the act of espousals\r\nconfirmed by the ring which Signor Lodovico placed on the bride's\r\nfinger, and that night the marriage was consummated,\" were the words of\r\nthe official proclamation that was made in Milan the next day, and duly\r\nnotified to the magistrates of the different cities in the duchy as well\r\nas to the duke's ambassadors at foreign courts.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Lodovico left for Milan, to complete the\r\narrangements for the bride's reception early in the following week.\r\nNothing, he was determined, should be left undone to do honour to his\r\nnuptials or to make the occasion memorable both in the eyes of the\r\npeople of Milan and throughout Italy. During the summer and autumn\r\npreparations had been actively going on, and a whole army of painters,\r\ngoldsmiths, and embroiderers were at work, decorating the suite of rooms\r\nin the Rocca, or inner citadel of the Castello of the Porta Giovia,\r\nadjoining the Corte Ducale, where the Moro and his bride were to take up\r\ntheir abode. \"Here all hands are busy,\" wrote the Ferrarese envoy to his\r\nmaster, \"and Lodovico takes care that for the duchess nothing is done by\r\nhalves.\" When the date of the wedding had been finally determined, every\r\nnerve was strained to complete the works within the Castello, and an\r\nimperative summons was issued by Messer Ambrogio Ferrari, the chief\r\nducal commissioner, to the governors of Cremona, Piacenza, and Pavia,\r\ncommanding the immediate return of the painters who were absent in these\r\ncities. Among the masters especially mentioned in these letters, we find\r\nthe names of Bernardino da Rossi, Zenale and Buttinone di Treviglio,\r\nTreso di Monza, and Magistro Leonardo. This was none other than the\r\ngreat Florentine, then absent at Pavia, who was required to give his\r\nadvice, if not to assist, in the actual decoration of the _Sala della\r\npalla_ on the first floor of the Castello. The vaulted roof of this\r\nspacious hall, which was to serve as ball-room on this occasion, was\r\npainted in azure and gold to imitate the starry sky, while the walls\r\nwere hung with canvases representing the heroic deeds of the great\r\nCondottiere, Francesco Sforza, whose glorious memory his son Lodovico\r\nwas always eager to celebrate. At the entrance of the hall, an effigy of\r\nthe hero on horseback was placed under a triumphal arch, with an\r\ninscription recalling his greatness, and saying that by virtue of these\r\nmighty exploits his children now triumph and hold festival in his\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, orders were sent in the duke's name to the seneschals\r\nof the castles and towns between Pavia and Milan to see that the roads\r\nand bridges were repaired and widened, in order that the bridal party\r\nmight be able to travel without hindrance or inconvenience. On the 18th\r\nof January, invitations were issued to the chief lords in the state, as\r\nwell as to those foreign princes who were connected by marriage with the\r\nSforza and Este families, the Marquis of Montferrat, the Marquis of\r\nMantua, Giovanni Bentivoglio of Bologna, and others, requesting them to\r\nhonour with their presence a three-days' tournament to be held on the\r\ngreat _piazza_ in front of the Castello, during the last week in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nWhile Lodovico was personally superintending the final arrangements,\r\nseeing that the last touches were given to the frescoes in the duchess's\r\n_Camerino_, or discussing to the masques and comedies that were to be\r\nperformed, with Bramante and Leonardo, his bride remained at Pavia with\r\nher family and friends. The princesses of Este were well content, for\r\nnot only were all the treasures of the Castello and library at their\r\ndisposal, but they had the best of company in the person of Messer\r\nGaleazzo di Sanseverino, who had been charged by his father-in-law,\r\nSignor Lodovico, to supply his place during the interval of his enforced\r\nabsence. And certainly no better squire of dames could have been found\r\nthan this courteous and brilliant cavalier. He took Isabella and\r\nBeatrice out riding in the park, and showed them some of the beauties\r\nof that wide domain, which in the French chronicler's eyes seemed more\r\nlike the garden of Eden than any earthly spot. They could not, it is\r\ntrue, admire those flowery lawns watered by crystal streams, and groves\r\nof plane and cypress and myrtle, which charmed the travellers from the\r\nnorth, and made Commines exclaim there was no other region in the world\r\nas divinely beautiful as the Milanese land. But they could visit the\r\npleasure-houses and pavilions in the gardens, and hunt the stags and red\r\ndeer that ran wild in the park. For their amusement Messer Galeazzo let\r\nfly some of those good falcons of his, with their jewelled hoods and\r\nsilver bells, and chased the herons and water-fowl along the lake, while\r\nthe ducal huntsmen followed in their suits of green velvet embroidered\r\nwith gold, and blew their golden bugles. Indoors they laughed and sang\r\ntogether, and turned over the leaves of the illuminated missals or the\r\nrare folios of the library. And as they talked of Messer Matteo\r\nBoiardo's famous new poem and of the old French romances, a lively\r\ndiscussion over the respective merits of the paladins, Roland and\r\nRinaldo di Montalbano arose between the two princesses on the one hand,\r\nand Messer Galeazzo on the other. Isabella and Beatrice were all in\r\nfavour of the knight of Montalbano as the type of Italian chivalry,\r\nwhile Sanseverino, who had kinsmen at the court of France and took\r\ndelight in French costumes and French literature, was as much at home in\r\nFrance as he was at Milan, and defended the matchless glory of his hero,\r\nOrlando. The quarrel waxed warm between them in those idle days, and in\r\nthe fulness of their youth and high spirits they amused themselves,\r\ncrying out, \"Rolando! Rolando!\" on the one side, and a \"Rinaldo!\" on the\r\nother, until one afternoon Messer Galeazzo was acknowledged victor, and\r\neven Isabella took up his cry of Roland, but soon returned to her old\r\nallegiance, and declared boldly that she would allow no rival to the\r\nwronged knight of Montalbano. The controversy was to be prolonged for\r\nmany a day, and was to become the theme of more than one merry letter\r\nand gay challenge between the Marchesana Isabella and the handsome\r\nSanseverino, who soon won over Duchess Beatrice to his side. So the days\r\nflew by until the week was almost over, and the time came to start for\r\nMilan. Every hour fresh news reached Pavia of the new wonders and\r\nmarvellous entertainments that were awaiting them at the Milanese\r\ncapital, and Isabella's spirits rose high with eager expectation and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be here,\" this lively princess wrote to her youngest\r\nbrother-in-law, Giovanni Gonzaga, who had stayed behind at Mantua, and\r\nwas absent from the wedding _fêtes_. And she told him of all the jousts\r\nand banquets and balls that were to succeed each other at Milan, this\r\nwonderful city which she was longing to see for herself. \"And among\r\nother _fêtes_,\" she added, \"there will be three of the finest theatrical\r\nrepresentations that have ever been seen. But one thing which will make\r\nyou still more envious is that from Milan we mean to go and visit that\r\nglorious city of Genoa, where you have never been! Only think how many\r\nnew places and lands we shall have seen by the time of our return! We\r\nwish you all good things, but fear our wishes will profit you little,\r\nand are sure my letter will make your mouth water.\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 21st the bridal party set out from Pavia, and, leaving\r\nthe Certosa on the right, travelled across the Lombard plain to Binasco,\r\nwhere they spent the night at the feudal castle of the Visconti, the\r\nruins of which may still be seen on the heights above the little town.\r\nOn Sunday morning the procession entered Milan, and the bride was\r\nreceived by her cousin, Isabella of Aragon, wife of the reigning duke,\r\nwho had ridden out to meet her at the suburban church of S. Eustorgio,\r\nwhere the bones of the martyred friar, S. Pietro Martire, repose in\r\ntheir shrine of sculptured marble. At the gates Duke Gian Galeazzo and\r\nhis uncle met them, followed by a brilliant company of Milanese nobles,\r\nand Lodovico, clad in a gorgeous mantle of gold brocade, rode through\r\nthe streets at the side of his youthful bride. A hundred trumpeters\r\nmarched before them, filling the air with strains of martial music, and\r\nthe crowds, who had assembled from all parts of Lombardy, thronged\r\naround to gaze on the duchess and her daughters, and more especially on\r\nthe Moro's bride.\r\n\r\nThe street decorations that day were on the grandest scale. Lodovico had\r\ngiven orders that no expense should be spared, and the magnificence of\r\nthe pageant amazed the foreign ambassadors and visitors from Mantua and\r\nFerrara. Not only were the walls and balconies hung with red and blue\r\nsatin or brocades, while wreaths of ivy were twined round the columns\r\nand doorways, but one whole street where the armourers had their shops\r\nwas lined with effigies of armed warriors on horseback, entirely clad\r\nwith chain-armour and plates of damascened steel. \"Every one took these\r\nmailed figures to be alive,\" says Tristan Calco, the admiring chronicler\r\nto whom we owe these details. The procession halted on the _piazza_ in\r\nfront of the Castello, and the heralds gave a loud blast of music as the\r\nbride was lifted from her horse, and received under the grand portal by\r\nthe duchess-mother, Bona of Savoy, and her two daughters, Bianca Maria\r\nand Anna Sforza. Bona herself had returned to Milan at the French king's\r\nrequest soon after her son's marriage, and had consented to an outward\r\nreconciliation with her brother-in-law, Lodovico. Her daughter Anna's\r\nmarriage with the heir of the house of Este had always been one of the\r\nobjects of her fondest wishes, and now she gave Duchess Leonora and her\r\ndaughters a cordial welcome to her son's court.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the marriage of Alfonso d'Este and the princess\r\nAnna was privately solemnized in the ducal chapel, but the final nuptial\r\nbenediction was deferred until their return to Ferrara, a month later.\r\nMeanwhile the bride's sumptuous trousseau and jewels, as well as the\r\nsplendid presents received by her, were displayed during the next week\r\nin the Castello, before the courtiers who came to pay their homage to\r\nthe newly wedded Duke and Duchess of Bari. Of Anna Sforza herself we\r\nhear little, but her beauty and gentleness are praised by more than one\r\ncontemporary chronicler, and endeared her especially to her uncle\r\nLodovico, who was sincerely grieved by her early death. She and her\r\nhusband paid frequent visits to Milan after her marriage, and were very\r\nhappy in the society of Beatrice, whom she only survived a few months,\r\ndying at the birth of her first babe, to the great sorrow of her\r\nfather-in-law, Duke Ercole. \"She was very beautiful and very charming,\"\r\nwrites the Ferrarese diarist, \"and there is little to tell about her,\r\nbecause she lived so short a time.\"\r\n\r\nThe most splendid _fêtes_ were yet to come. On the 24th of January, the\r\nday after Alfonso and Anna's wedding, three tribunals were erected on\r\nthe piazza, the one occupied by a group of heralds and trumpeters, the\r\nother loaded with precious bowls and dishes of gold and silver plate,\r\nthe gifts of the magistrates of Milan and other cities to Signor\r\nLodovico and his bride. The new duchess, accompanied by the other\r\nprinces and princesses, arrayed in their richest robes and literally\r\nblazing with precious jewels, writes an eye-witness, ascended the third\r\ntribunal erected in the centre, and received the homage of the deputies\r\nof the city; after which two cavaliers, a Visconti and a Suardi, bending\r\non one knee before the bride, took from her hand two lengths of cloth of\r\ngold, which were hung in the courtyard, as prizes to be given to the\r\nvictor in the tournament. That evening two hundred Milanese ladies of\r\nhigh rank were invited to the great ball, or _festa per le donne_, given\r\nin the Sala della palla. On this occasion peasant girls from all parts\r\nof Italy, clad in the red, white, and blue of the Sforza colours, danced\r\nbefore the court, and \"the palm of Terpsichore,\" we are told, was\r\nawarded to a Tuscan maiden.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, the Giostra, which was to be the crowning event of the\r\nweek's festivities, began. At the tournament held in Pavia in honour of\r\nGiangaleazzo's wedding, the knights had for the most part appeared in\r\ntheir ordinary attire; but this time, to add greater splendour to the\r\noccasion, they entered the lists in companies, clad in fancy costumes\r\nand bearing symbolical devices after the fashion of the day. First of\r\nall came the Mantuan troop of twenty horsemen clad in green velvet and\r\ngold lace, bearing golden lances and olive boughs in their hand, with\r\nIsabella's kinsman, Alfonso Gonzaga, at their head. Then came Annibale\r\nBentivoglio, the young husband of Lucrezia d'Este, with the Bologna\r\nknights, riding on a triumphal car drawn by stags and unicorns, the\r\nbadge of the House of Este. These were followed by Gaspare di\r\nSanseverino, with a band of twelve riders in black and gold Moorish\r\ndress, bearing Lodovico's device of the Moor's head on their helmets and\r\nwhite doves on their black armour. Last of all came a troop of wild\r\nScythians, mounted on Barbary steeds, who galloped across the _piazza_,\r\nand then, halting in front of the ducal party, suddenly threw off their\r\ndisguise and appeared in magnificent array, with the captain of the\r\nMilanese armies, Galeazzo di Sanseverino, at their head. He planted his\r\ngolden lance in the ground, and at this sign a giant Moor, advancing to\r\nthe front, recited a poem in honour of Duchess Beatrice.[6]\r\n\r\nThese pageants and masques formed an important feature of Renaissance\r\n_fêtes_, and were evidently regarded as such by the chroniclers of these\r\nwedding festivities, but to us the chief interest of this tournament\r\nlies in the knowledge that the Scythian disguise assumed by Galeazzo di\r\nSanseverino and his companions was designed by no less a personage than\r\nLeonardo da Vinci. Some of the drawings of savages and masks which we\r\nsee to-day on the stray leaves of his sketch-books may relate to these\r\nfigures, but we know for certain that he was actually employed by Messer\r\nGaleazzo to arrange this masquerade. In a note in his own handwriting,\r\non the margin of the \"Codex Atlanticus,\" we read, \"Item, 26 of January,\r\nbeing in the house of Messer Galeazzo di San Sev^o, ordering the festa\r\nof his Giostra, certain men-at-arms took off their vests to try on some\r\nclothes of savages, upon which Giacomo\" (the apprentice whom he had\r\nalready caught thieving at Pavia) \"took up a purse which lay on the bed\r\nwith their other clothes, and took the money that was inside it.\" The\r\nactual share which the great Florentine took in the preparation of the\r\nwedding festivities has often been discussed, and we are never likely to\r\nknow how much of the duchess's cabinet he painted, or what part he took\r\nin the decoration of the city, but at least this characteristic note on\r\nthe lad whose honesty he had reason to suspect, proves that he was\r\npresent in Milan at the time, and was the authority to whom Lodovico's\r\nson-in-law naturally turned for advice in planning this masquerade.\r\nIncidents of this kind help us to realize how many and varied were the\r\noffices Leonardo was called upon to discharge in his master's service,\r\nand how frequent were the interruptions which interfered with the\r\npainting of his pictures or the modelling of his great horse.\r\n\r\nAfter this pageant, the serious business of the Giostra began, and the\r\ntilting-matches lasted during three whole days. Among the foremost\r\nknights who distinguished themselves on this occasion, the chronicler\r\nand court poet mention the Marquis of Mantua, who entered the lists in\r\ndisguise; young Annibale Bentivoglio, who wounded his hand badly, but\r\nrefused to leave the ground; the Marchesino Girolamo Stanga, one of\r\nIsabella d'Este's especial friends and of Beatrice's most devoted\r\nservants; and Niccolo da Correggio, who was universally admired in his\r\nsuit of gold brocade. All four Sanseverini brothers fought in the lists\r\nwith their wonted skill and valour, but once more Messer Galeazzo,\r\n_Gentis columen_, came off the victor and proved himself unrivalled in\r\ncourtly exercises, both as jouster and swordsman. On the last day of the\r\ntournament the prizes were given away, and Messer Galeazzo was conducted\r\ntriumphantly to the Rocca, and there received the _pallium_ of gold\r\nbrocade from the bride's own hand.[7] As soon as Lodovico recognized the\r\nMarquis of Mantua, he sent him a pressing invitation to take his place\r\nwith the ducal party; and Gianfrancesco, unable to refuse so courteous a\r\nrequest, joined his wife and sat down with the rest of his kinsfolk to\r\nthe family banquet, which was held that night in the Castello.\r\n\r\nA curious letter, addressed by the Duke of Milan to his uncle Cardinal\r\nAscanio Sforza in Rome, gives a full and minute account of this\r\ntournament, which Giangaleazzo describes as one of the most important\r\nevents of his reign, and which he begs may be fully reported to His\r\nHoliness Pope Innocent. He dwells on the extraordinary magnificence of\r\nthe sight, on the number and size of the lances used, which were more\r\nnumerous and larger than ever before seen on these occasions, and ends\r\nwith a splendid tribute to Messer Galeazzo, who both in valour and\r\nfortune surpassed all others. On the other hand, we recognize the\r\ncunning of Lodovico in the despatch addressed on this occasion by the\r\nducal secretary to the Milanese envoy at Bologna. Here the incidents of\r\nthe Giostra are briefly recounted, and great stress is laid on the\r\nvalour displayed by Messer Annibale Bentivoglio, who, notwithstanding\r\nhis wounded hand, broke many lances, and, in spite of his great youth,\r\nproved himself as skilled a jouster as any, and won no less glory than\r\nif he had borne off the prize, which he would certainly have done if\r\nfortune had served him as well as he deserved.\r\n\r\nThe wedding festivities were now brought to a close, and were\r\nunanimously pronounced to have passed off with brilliant success.\r\nNothing now remained for the bride's mother but to take leave of her\r\ndaughter and return home. Accordingly, on the 1st of February, Duchess\r\nLeonora set out on her homeward journey, with her son and his newly-made\r\nbride and the Marchioness Isabella, accompanied by an escort of two\r\nhundred Milanese gentlemen, with Anna's brother, Ermes Sforza, and the\r\nCount of Caiazzo--Gianfrancesco, the eldest of the Sanseverino brothers\r\n--at their head. Both Leonora and Isabella were anxious to see the\r\nCertosa, of which they had heard so much, on their way back to Pavia,\r\nand Lodovico, glad to do the honours of this famous abbey, in which he\r\ntook a just pride, sent a courier with the following letter to inform\r\nthe prior and brothers of the Duchess of Ferrara's visit:--\r\n\r\n\"Since, besides the other honours which we have paid to the illustrious\r\nDuchess of Ferrara, we are above all anxious to show her the most\r\nremarkable things in our domain, and since we count this our church and\r\nmonastery to be among the chief of these, we write this to inform you\r\nthat the said duchess will visit the Certosa on Wednesday next, on her\r\nreturn home. And we desire you to give her a fitting reception, and to\r\nprepare an honourable banquet for the duchess and her company, which\r\nwill number about four hundred persons and horses. No excuse on your\r\npart can be allowed, since this is our will and pleasure. And above all\r\nyou will see that an abundant supply of lampreys is prepared. But we are\r\nquite sure that you will do your best to pay honour to the duchess,\r\nsince otherwise we should feel obliged to do a thing that would be\r\ndispleasing to you, and send our chamberlain to provide for her\r\nhonourable entertainment.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe prior and brothers of the Certosa knew their own interest too well\r\nnot to comply with this somewhat imperious missive, and left nothing\r\nundone which could gratify their illustrious guests. Isabella's\r\ncuriosity for the beautiful and marvellous was amply gratified, and in\r\nLodovico's future letters to his sister-in-law we find more than one\r\nallusion to \"our church and convent of the Certosa, which you saw when\r\nyou were at Pavia.\" After spending the following night at the Castello\r\ndi Pavia, the duchess and her large party embarked on the bucentaurs\r\nthat were awaiting them at the junction of the Ticino and the Po, and\r\nreached Ferrara on the 11th of February, there to begin a new series of\r\nsplendid entertainments in honour of Don Alfonso's marriage with this\r\nSforza princess.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Porrò in A.

Under the watchful eye of\r\na wise and careful mother, she had been trained in all the learning and\r\naccomplishments of the day, but had been allowed little liberty or\r\nopportunity of revealing her strong individuality. Her charms and\r\ntalents had been thrown into the shade by the superior beauty and\r\nintellect of the Marchioness Isabella, and until the day she landed at\r\nPavia she had been regarded in the comparatively insignificant light of\r\nthe younger and less gifted sister. Now all this suddenly changed. At\r\nthe age of fifteen, Beatrice d'Este found herself the wife of the ablest\r\nand most powerful prince in Italy, released from all the restraints\r\nhitherto imposed upon her and placed in a position of absolute freedom\r\nand independence. From the quiet regularity of the sheltered life which\r\nshe had led at Ferrara by her mother's side, she suddenly found herself\r\ntransplanted to the gayest and most splendid court in Italy, surrounded\r\nby every luxury that wealth could give and every beautiful object that\r\ntaste could devise. The bravest captains and the most accomplished\r\nartists of the day were at her feet, ready to obey her orders and\r\ngratify her smallest fancy. Leonardo and Bramante were at hand to\r\narrange pageants and masquerades, to paint _amorini_ on her mantelpiece\r\nor mythological fables along the frieze of her rooms, to build elegant\r\npavilions, or lay out labyrinths and lakes in her garden. Bellincioni\r\nand a dozen other poets celebrated her name and recorded her words and\r\nactions in verse; learned scholars and commentators read Dante to her\r\nwhen she cared to listen. Niccolo da Correggio not only wrote sonnets\r\nand canzoni for her to sing but invented new patterns for her gowns; and\r\nCristoforo Romano laid down the sculptor's chisel to play the lyre or\r\nviol for her pleasure. For her the wise man of Pavia, Lorenzo Gusnasco,\r\nfashioned cunningly wrought instruments, lutes and viols inlaid with\r\nebony and ivory, and organs inscribed with Latin mottoes; and the\r\nwonderful tenor, Cordier, the priest of Louvain, sang his sweetest and\r\nmost entrancing strains in the ducal chapel. For her amusement the court\r\njesters laughed and chattered and played their foolish tricks--Diodato,\r\nwho had followed her from Ferrara, and the witty clown Barone, the\r\npetted favourite of Isabella d'Este and Veronica Gambara and a dozen\r\nother great ladies. And Messer Galeazzo was ready to risk his life and\r\nruin his best clothes, all for the sake of his duchess. From the moment\r\nof Beatrice's arrival at the Milanese court she won all hearts, less by\r\nher beauty than by her vivacity and high spirits, her bright eyes and\r\nringing laugh, her frank gladness and keen enjoyment of life. How\r\nfavourable was the first impression which the young duchess made upon\r\nthose around her, we learn from the letters which the Ferrarese envoy\r\nand ladies-in-waiting addressed almost daily to her anxious parents,\r\nduring the first few weeks after her marriage. Every little incident,\r\neach word or act that is likely to please Duchess Leonora, is faithfully\r\nreported by these good servants, in their eagerness to allay the natural\r\nfears of the loving mother for the absent child in her brilliant but\r\ndifficult position. The demeanour of Signor Lodovico towards his wife,\r\nall he said and thought of her, was narrowly watched by Giacomo Trotti,\r\nand duly repeated in his letters to Ferrara. For the present this was\r\neminently satisfactory. \"Signor Lodovico,\" writes the ambassador during\r\nthe wedding festivities at Milan, \"has nothing but the highest praise\r\nboth for his wife and the Marchesana. He is never tired of saying how\r\nmuch pleasure he takes in their company.\r\n\r\n\"Here jousting and tilting, feasting and dancing, are the order of the\r\nday. Signor Lodovico is delighted with his wife's appearance, and\r\nto-day, when she gave away the prizes, he kissed her repeatedly in the\r\neyes of all the people.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again a few days later, when the festivities were ended and the\r\nducal family were enjoying a little rest before the party broke up, he\r\nwrites--\r\n\r\n\"Whenever Lodovico Sforza is wanted, he is always to be found in the\r\ncompany of his wife, of the Marchesana, of Don Alfonso and Madonna Anna,\r\nwith whom he is never tired of talking and laughing, exactly as if he\r\nwere a youth of their own age.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February, after the departure of the duchess and her\r\nchildren, Trotti wrote again, remarking, \"Signor Lodovico seems to think\r\nof nothing but how best to please and amuse his wife, and every day he\r\ntells me how dear she is to him.\"[9]\r\n\r\nAmong the Ferrarese ladies who had remained at Milan, in attendance on\r\nthe young duchess, was her cousin, Polisenna d'Este, who, being\r\nconsiderably older and more sedate, and no longer either young or\r\nbeautiful, had for these very reasons been placed by Leonora in her\r\ndaughter's household, and desired to keep her informed of all that\r\nhappened. Early in February this lady-in-waiting wrote the following\r\nletter to Isabella d'Este, in terms that were well calculated to\r\nreassure both the anxious sister and mother as to Beatrice's happiness\r\nand her husband's behaviour:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MADONNA AND DEAR MARCHESANA,\r\n\r\n\"Since I have remained here after your Highness's departure from Milan,\r\ncontinually in the company of your sister, the illustrious Duchess of\r\nBari, and of her husband, Signor Lodovico, I will no longer delay to\r\ndischarge my duty in sending you some comforting words as to the\r\nwell-being and happiness of the said duchess. I cannot express how happy\r\nshe is to see herself every day more affectionately caressed and petted\r\nby her husband, who seems to find his sole delight in giving her every\r\npossible pleasure and amusement. It is indeed a rare joy to see them\r\ntogether and to realize what cordial love and good-will he bears her.\r\nGod grant it may last long! And I felt that I must write this good news\r\nto your Highness, knowing that it would give you especial satisfaction.\r\nI will only add that the air here seems to suit her particularly well,\r\nand that she is certainly very much improved and stronger in appearance,\r\nand seems every day to grow more beautiful. I beg of your Highness to\r\ncommend me to Madonna Beatrice and Collona.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your Highness's servant,\r\n                                                     POLISSENA D'ESTE.\r\n\r\nFrom Milan, 12th of February, 1491.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Beatrice herself wrote to Isabella in answer to her letter from her\r\nsister, describing the festivities at Ferrara, where her presence had\r\nbeen sadly missed by her affectionate relatives.\r\n\r\n\"I leave you to imagine how much content and delight your letter of the\r\n17th has given me. For in it you give me so full and vivid a description\r\nof the successful _fêtes_ in honour of the wedding of Madonna Anna, our\r\nbrother's wife and dearest sister, that I seem to have been present\r\nthere myself. And since you know well how much I love and respect you, I\r\nam sure you will understand how glad I was to hear from you. Your\r\nletter, indeed, gave me greater pleasure than any which I have received\r\nsince you left here, and I am quite sure that all of these pageants and\r\nspectacles were distinguished by the utmost beauty and gallantry, as you\r\nsay, since they were all planned and arranged by our dear father, who\r\norders these things with consummate wisdom and perfection. I can well\r\nbelieve that my absence has been a real grief to you, and that these\r\n_fêtes_ have given you but little pleasure, since I was not there. For\r\nmy own part, I cannot deny that, now I am without your company, I feel\r\nnot only that I am deprived of a very dear sister, but that I have lost\r\nhalf of myself. And if it were not for the new and continual amusements\r\nwhich my illustrious husband provides every day for my pleasure, I\r\nshould have been inconsolable until I could be once more with you. But\r\nsince our hearts and thoughts are still one, and we are able to exchange\r\nletters constantly, I beg you to take comfort as I do, and rest content\r\nin feeling that, now these ceremonies are all over, we can at least speak\r\nto each other by means of letters, written with our own hands, as you\r\nhave promised me.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThis simple, warm-hearted letter, which breathes all the frankness and\r\naffection of Beatrice's nature, is written, like most of her early\r\nletters, in her own hand. The words are often badly spelt, and her\r\nhandwriting is larger and less formed than that of Isabella, which it\r\notherwise resembles. But owing to the multiplicity of interests and\r\noccupations that claimed her time after the first years of her married\r\nlife, the young duchess generally employed a secretary, and has left\r\ncomparatively few letters. Lodovico himself addressed several letters to\r\nhis sister-in-law, to whom he was sincerely attached, and in order to\r\nfacilitate the intercourse between the two sisters, and as he said, to\r\nleave Isabella no excuse for not answering his communications, he sent a\r\ncourier regularly every week to Mantua, with orders to await the\r\nMarchesana's pleasure and bring back her letters.\r\n\r\n\"Loving you cordially as I do,\" he writes, a fortnight after her\r\ndeparture, \"and, knowing that I have in you a very dear sister, nothing\r\ncan give me greater pleasure than letters from your hand. I thank your\r\nHighness most sincerely for all that you tell me, and most of all for\r\nyour warm expressions of affection and for saying how sorry you were to\r\nleave us, and how not even the splendid _fêtes_ in Ferrara could console\r\nyou for being deprived of our presence. All I beg of you is to write\r\noften, and I will see that your letters are brought here.\"\r\n\r\nBesides her sister and brother-in-law and Madonna Polisenna, Isabella\r\nhad another correspondent at the court of Milan, in the person of Messer\r\nGaleazzo di Sanseverino, with whom she had formed a warm friendship at\r\nPavia, and who had promised to give her frequent news of her sister,\r\nwhile at the same time he still carried on the battle over Roland and\r\nRinaldo which had been started in the park of the Castello at Pavia. He\r\ntoo, writing on the 11th of February, was able to assure the Marchesana\r\nthat all was going well, and that the relations between her sister and\r\nSignor Lodovico left nothing to be desired.\r\n\r\n\"My Duchess,\" as he always calls the mistress to whose service he had\r\npledged his sword and life, \"perseveres in showing Signor Lodovico an\r\naffection which is truly beyond all praise, and, to put it briefly, I am\r\nsatisfied that there is such real attachment between them, that I do not\r\nbelieve two persons could love each other better.\"\r\n\r\nThe presence of this young and joyous princess gave a touch of romance\r\nto court life, and inspired men like Galeazzo and Niccolo da Correggio\r\nwith a chivalrous devotion to her person. Every one was ready to obey\r\nher wishes, and eager to win her smiles and to earn her thanks.\r\n\r\nEven Giangaleazzo, the feeble duke who seldom took pleasure in anything\r\nbut horses and dogs, and often treated his own wife in a brutal way,\r\nfelt the charm of this bright young creature, and was stirred out of his\r\nusual apathy by the coming of Beatrice. In a letter which he addressed\r\nto the Duke of Ferrara after the wedding festivities, he went out of his\r\nway to express the affection with which this charming princess, his\r\nwife's cousin and his uncle's wife, has inspired him.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" he writes, \"sufficiently express how much joy this marriage\r\nhas given me, and how glad I am to see the singular virtues and talents\r\nof _Madonna la sposa_.\" And after formally congratulating the duke on\r\nhis daughter's marriage, and on the renewed alliance between the two\r\nhouses, he goes on to say how much he rejoices in his uncle's happiness,\r\nwhich will, he feels sure, only increase his own. \"For by means of this\r\nmarriage, besides the two sisters which God had already given us, we\r\nhave now gained a third, whom by God's grace we shall not love less than\r\nthe two who are ours by nature.\"\r\n\r\nGiangaleazzo's own wife, Duchess Isabella, a virtuous and high-minded\r\nprincess whose own merits were sadly hampered by her husband's weakness\r\nand folly, was much beloved by her own servants, but inherited the proud\r\nreserve of the Aragonese race, and led a secluded existence with her\r\nlord, who hated town life and seldom showed his face in Milan. But this\r\nyoung wife of Lodovico, it was easy to see, would soon throw her into\r\nthe shade. Beatrice's presence lent a charm to the most tedious court\r\nfunctions. Her high spirits and overflowing mirth threw new zest into\r\nevery pursuit. Grave senators and wise statesmen listened to her words\r\nwith interest, and grey-headed prelates tolerated her merry jokes and\r\nsmiled at her irrepressible laughter. She sang and danced, and played at\r\nball and rode races, and took long hunting and fishing expeditions to\r\nthe royal villas in the neighbourhood of Milan. \"My wife,\" wrote\r\nLodovico to his sister-in-law three months after his marriage, \"has\r\ndeveloped a perfect passion for horsemanship, and is always either\r\nriding or hunting.\"\r\n\r\nThe regent himself was too deeply engaged in state affairs, and devoted\r\ntoo much time and attention to the details of administration, to be able\r\nto accompany his wife as a rule. But she had a devoted comrade in her\r\nhusband's son-in-law, whom he deputed to escort the duchess on her more\r\ndistant expeditions. Since his betrothal to Lodovico's daughter,\r\nGaleazzo had enjoyed all the privileges of a son, and was already, what\r\nthe Moro had promised to make him, the first man in the state. He\r\nassisted at all state audiences, and was the only person present when\r\nLodovico received foreign ambassadors. He shared the Moro's private\r\nlife, and always dined alone with the duke and duchess when there were\r\nno other guests at their table. His letters to Isabella d'Este give\r\nlively accounts of the expeditions which he took in Beatrice's company\r\nduring the first few months of her married life.\r\n\r\n\"This morning, being Friday,\" he writes on the 11th of February, 1491,\r\n\"I started at ten o'clock with the duchess and all of her ladies on\r\nhorseback to go to Cussago, and in order to let your Highness enter\r\nfully into our pleasures, I must tell you that first of all I had to\r\nride in a chariot with the duchess and Dioda, and as we drove we sang\r\nmore than twenty-five songs, arranged for three voices. That is to say,\r\nDioda took the tenor part, and the duchess the soprano, whilst I sang\r\nsometimes bass and sometimes soprano, and played so many foolish tricks\r\nthat I really think I may claim to be more of a fool than Dioda! And now\r\nfarewell for to-night, and I will try to improve still further, so as to\r\nafford your Highness the more pleasure when you come here in the\r\nsummer.\"\r\n\r\nBut Messer Galeazzo's story does not end here. A day or two later he\r\ntakes up the thread of his discourse again, and describes the pleasant\r\nday which the duchess spent at Cussago, one of Lodovico Sforza's\r\nfavourite villas on the sunny slopes of the Brianza, six miles from\r\nMilan, on the way to Como.\r\n\r\n\"Having reached Cussago,\" he goes on, \"we had a grand fishing expedition\r\nin the river, and caught an immense quantity of large pike, trout,\r\nlampreys, crabs, and several other good sorts of smaller fish, and\r\nproceeded to dine off them until we could eat no more. Then, to make our\r\nmeal digest the better, directly after dinner we began to play at ball\r\nwith great vigour and energy, and after we had played for some time we\r\nwent over the palace, which is really very beautiful, and, among other\r\nthings, contains a doorway of carved marble, as fine as the new works at\r\nthe Certosa. Next we examined the result of our sport, which had been\r\nlaid out in front of the place, and took back as many of the lampreys\r\nand crabs as we could eat with us, and sent some of the lampreys to his\r\nHighness the duke. When this was done, we went to another palace and\r\ncaught more than a thousand large trout, and after choosing out the best\r\nfor presents and for our own holy throats, we had the rest thrown back\r\ninto the water. And then we mounted our horses again, and began to let\r\nfly some of those good falcons of mine which you saw at Pavia, along the\r\nriver-side, and they killed several birds. By this time it was already\r\nfour o'clock. We rode out to hunt stags and fawns, and after giving\r\nchase to twenty-two and killing two stags and two fawns, we returned\r\nhome and reached Milan an hour after dark, and presented the result of\r\nour day's sport to my lord the Duke of Bari. My illustrious lord took\r\nthe greatest possible pleasure in hearing all we had done, far more,\r\nindeed, than if he had been there in person, and I believe that my\r\nduchess will in the end reap the greatest benefit, and that Signor\r\nLodovico will give her Cussago, which is a place of rare beauty and\r\nworth. But I have cut my boots to pieces and torn my clothes, and played\r\nthe fool into the bargain, and these are the rewards one gains in the\r\nservice of ladies. However, I will have patience, since it is all for\r\nthe sake of my duchess, whom I never mean to fail in life or death.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SFORZA MS. ILLUMINATED _From a private photograph._]\r\n\r\nGaleazzo was a true prophet, and in the British Museum we may still\r\nadmire the beautifully illuminated deed of gift, adorned with friezes of\r\nexquisite cherubs and medallion-portraits of Lodovico and Beatrice, by\r\nwhich the fair palace and lands of Cussago became the property of the\r\nyoung duchess. This favourite villa of the Visconti had been left by\r\nFrancesco Sforza to his son Lodovico, who had employed a host of\r\narchitects and painters to adorn its walls. Bramante is said to have\r\nreared the noble bell-tower and portico that are still standing, while\r\nMilanese or Pavian sculptors carved the medallions bearing the Sforza\r\narms, and the portrait of Lodovico that may still be seen on the arcades\r\nof the loggia. To-day the once beautiful country-house is a ruin; the\r\nmarble doorway which Galeazzo and Beatrice admired, carved it may be by\r\nthat same Cristoforo Romano to whom we owe the portal of the Stanga\r\npalace, and that of Isabella d'Este's studio at Mantua, has disappeared.\r\nOnly the fragments of frescoes and the rich terra-cotta mouldings and\r\nslender columns of the elegant _cortile_ recall the joyous day which\r\nBeatrice d'Este and her ladies spent at the villa. But their memory\r\nsheds a glamour on the scene, and in the story of those Renaissance\r\ndays, among so much that is dark and sinister, it is pleasant to recall\r\nthis picture of the young duchess and her gallant cavalier singing songs\r\nfor pure gladness of heart as they rode out together in the fair spring\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"One thing only,\" wrote Messer Galeazzo, \"was wanting to our pleasure,\r\nand that was the sweet company of yourself, fair Madonna Marchesana.\"\r\nAnd with a sigh he tells her how much she is missed in the Castello of\r\nMilan, and how often he wishes he could find her in Madonna the Duchess\r\nof Ferrara's rooms, having her long hair combed and curled by her\r\nfavourite maidens Teodora and Beatrice and Violante, to all of whom he\r\nsends courteous greeting. Then he returns to the old controversy over\r\nOrlando, and replies to a gay challenge which Isabella has sent him in a\r\nletter to Signor Lodovico, only wishing she were here to defend Rinaldo\r\nin person, or rather to be made to own the error of her ways, and to\r\nconfess that the knight of Montalbano is not to be compared to Roland!\r\nBut he warns her that if she perseveres in this heresy, he will draw up\r\nsuch an indictment of Rinaldo's faults as will fill her with confusion,\r\nand make her recognize with shame his inferiority to Roland, that baron\r\nof immortal fame, of whom nothing but good can be said. Isabella,\r\nhowever, stuck to her colours, and, a whole month later, Messer Galeazzo\r\nsent her a long letter from Vigevano, in which he drew up an elaborate\r\nparallel between the conduct of the two paladins, as recorded in\r\nBoiardo's poem, and ended with a splendid eulogy of Roland.\r\n\r\n\"Roland the most Christian! Roland the pure and strong, prudent, just,\r\nand merciful servant of Christ, the true defender of widows and orphans!\r\nOf his valour I will say nothing, this being known to all the world; but\r\nthis I say, that when I think of my worship for Roland, however sad and\r\nill disposed I may be feeling, my heart rejoices, and I become glad of\r\nheart and joyous again.\"\r\n\r\nSo he begs her, for the love that he bears her Highness, to try and\r\namend her ways and recant her errors, and do penitence in this Lenten\r\nseason for her fault, after the example of the great apostle St. Paul,\r\nwho was converted to the Christian faith, and became an elect son and\r\nmighty preacher of the gospel, bringing many to righteousness and\r\nenjoying the high favour of our Lord God. For Roland, the Marchesa may\r\nknow for certain, has his place in Paradise with the saints, \"and in\r\nserving him you will be serving God; but if, on the other hand, you\r\npersevere in your false opinions, you will find that you are serving the\r\ndevil, who accompanied Rinaldo both in his life here and afterwards in\r\nhis death. And remember,\" he adds in conclusion, \"when the blind lead\r\nthe blind, both fall into the ditch!\"\r\n\r\nNothing daunted by this long harangue, Isabella retorted in an equally\r\nlengthy epistle, flatly denying the charges brought against Rinaldo as\r\nfalse and unsupported by a tittle of evidence. Galeazzo replied in\r\nanother bantering letter, assuming the part of a priest, and exhorting\r\nthe fair sinner to confess her faults in these holy days of Passiontide,\r\nlest she should incur greater damnation, and drive her soul into the\r\ndevil's jaws.\r\n\r\n\"And since this is the hour of penitence and contrition,\" he concludes,\r\n\"I would once more beg and pray your Highness to return to the true\r\nfaith and devotion of Roland, having before your eyes the good example\r\nof our most illustrious duchess, your sister, who has acknowledged her\r\nerrors, and become a sincere follower of Roland, as a good Christian,\r\nand is now gone to Milan to obtain pardon.\r\n\r\n                                \"Your most humble and devoted servant,\r\n                                             GALEAZ SFORTIA VICECOMES,\r\n                                             _Armorum Capitaneus_.[11]\r\n\r\nVigevano, 30th of March, 1491.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella, however, still remained obdurate, declaring that on no account\r\nwould she follow Beatrice's changeable conduct, and was ready to defend\r\nher hero against a hundred thousand opponents. Upon which Galeazzo\r\nreminded her that, for all her boastings, she had been constrained to\r\nyield to his single-handed efforts in the park at Pavia, and had ended\r\nby taking up his cry of \"Roland.\" The more pity that she should turn her\r\nback upon the good cause now, and prove the inconstancy of woman's\r\nnature! But he consoled himself by reflecting that the Marchesana would\r\nsoon be back at Milan, when he would easily be able to make her give up\r\nRinaldo, and once more cry \"Roland\" as she had done before.\r\n\r\nThis letter was written by Galeazzo on the 13th of April, after which\r\nthe subject dropped for a while, until it was revived by a visit which\r\nhis brother, Gaspare Fracassa, paid to Mantua in the summer with his\r\nwife, Margherita Pia, a great friend of the Marchesana and Duchess of\r\nUrbino. Isabella could not resist the opportunity of returning the\r\ncharge, and sent Messer Galeazzo, by his brother's hands, a challenge to\r\nbattle, couched in approved terms, and indicating her choice of arms and\r\nof the scene of action. Galeazzo replied in the most courteous language,\r\ndeclaring himself absolutely at the service of his fair challenger, and\r\nassuring her that her coming is awaited with the utmost impatience by\r\nSignor Lodovico, the Duchess of Bari, and her humble servant.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Isabella prepared herself for the fray by collecting all the\r\ninformation on the subject that she could possibly obtain. In that same\r\nmonth of August, when Galeazzo sent her the last-named letter from his\r\nvilla at Castelnuovo, near Tortona, the Marchesana wrote to the Mantuan\r\nambassador at Venice, desiring him to send her all the poems and\r\nromances concerning French paladins at the court of Charlemagne which he\r\ncould discover. At the same time she addressed a letter to her old\r\nfriend, Messer Matteo Boiardo, at Ferrara, requesting him to send her\r\nthe concluding cantos of his poem, the \"Orlando Innamorato,\" which had\r\nnot as yet been given to the world. The poet replied that, to his great\r\nregret, he was unable to comply with her wish, since the cantos in\r\nquestion were not yet written; and Isabella could only beg him to let\r\nher have a copy of the two earlier books, in order that she might\r\nrefresh her memory by reading them once more.\r\n\r\nBut the Marchesana's intended visit to Milan was, after all, put off,\r\nand Messer Galeazzo was called away to more arduous duties in camp and\r\nfield. The debate, which had been prolonged with so much wit and\r\ningenuity on both sides, came to an abrupt ending. It was left to the\r\nFlorentine poet, Bellincioni, in whose verses the smallest incidents\r\nthat took place at court were faithfully reflected, to celebrate this\r\n\"praiseworthy and memorable duel of intellect between these two august\r\npersonages.\" At Beatrice's command Bellincioni wrote three sonnets\r\nillustrating the arguments brought forward on either side. In the first,\r\nhe adopts Isabella's standpoint, and is all in favour of Rinaldo. In the\r\nsecond, he sees a vision of Roland with the saints in Paradise, and\r\ndeclares almost in the same language as Galeazzo, that whereas Rinaldo\r\nwas only a brave soldier, Roland was able and virtuous as well as\r\nvaliant. Finally, in the third, he exhorts the illustrious marchioness\r\nto recant her errors, since the Scriptures tell us that it is human to\r\nerr, and not to follow the bad example of Pharaoh who hardened his\r\nheart, but to see how immeasurably inferior Rinaldo was to his rival,\r\nand to become, with Messer Galeazzo and others of his merit, a true\r\nChristian and follower of Roland.\r\n\r\nThe whole controversy is a curious instance of the deep interest which\r\nthese great ladies of the Italian Renaissance and their courtiers took\r\nin literary subjects, and especially in the romances of the Carlovingian\r\ncycle. This interest was not confined to the upper circles of society,\r\nbut spread through all classes, and was no doubt largely increased by\r\nthe songs and the improvisations of strolling minstrels and Provençal\r\nstory-tellers. First of all the Florentine Pulci, and after him Boiardo\r\nand Bello of Ferrara, sought inspiration in the same source, and later\r\non their example was followed by Ariosto and Tasso. And Poggio, writing\r\nin the fifteenth century, tells us how in his day a worthy citizen of\r\nMilan, after hearing one of these wandering _cantatores_ chanting the\r\nstory of Roland's death with dramatic action and effect, went home\r\nweeping so bitterly that his wife and friends could hardly console him\r\nor induce him to dry his tears. \"And yet,\" remarks the grave historian,\r\n\"this Roland they tell of has been dead well-nigh seven hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Isabella's share in this singular and interesting\r\ncorrespondence has perished, and only Messer Galeazzo's letters survive.\r\nThese may still be seen in the Gonzaga Archives, where they were first\r\ndiscovered by Signor Alessandro Luzio and Signor Rodolfo Renier. These\r\nlearned writers are in some perplexity as to the identity of the writer,\r\nsince the letters are signed Galeaz _Sfortia Vicecomes_, and internal\r\nevidence will not allow them to have been written by any Galeazzo Sforza\r\nor Visconti then living. But there can hardly be a doubt as to who the\r\nwriter actually was. Galeazzo di Sanseverino had been adopted by\r\nLodovico Sforza when he married his daughter Bianca, and from that time\r\nused the surname of the ducal house, _Sfortia Vicecomes_, and very\r\nfrequently added his title of _Armorum Capitaneus_, captain of the\r\narmies of Milan. His well-known patronage of artists and love of\r\nletters, as well as his intimate connection with the duke and duchess,\r\nall point in the same direction; and if any further proof were needed,\r\nthe mention of his brother Gaspare, and the allusion to Galeazzo by name\r\nin one of Bellincioni's sonnets on the subject, and the fact that one of\r\nthe letters is dated from his own villa of Castelnuovo, near Tortona,\r\nwould be sufficient to settle the question. The champion of Orlando and\r\nthe faithful servant of Beatrice d'Este was, it is evident, none other\r\nthan the friend of Leonardo and Castiglione--that ideal knight, Galeazzo\r\ndi Sanseverino.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] G.

Life for her was full of mirth and rapture; a long prospect of\r\nendless pleasures seemed to open before her as the first breath of spring\r\npassed over the green Lombard plains, and the delicious gardens of the\r\nCastello of Milan and the long avenues on the sunny terraces of Vigevano\r\nburst into leaf. The world seemed waking into new bliss, and Duchess\r\nBeatrice was the gayest and gladdest of its creatures. So at least she\r\nappeared to those who saw her in the full enjoyment of chase or dance.\r\nBut there was a darker side to the picture. Lodovico looked on his young\r\nwife as a joyous and fascinating child, as he told Giacomo Trotti,\r\n\"_lieta di natura et molto piacevolina_,\" and thought that as long as he\r\ntreated her with consideration and respect, and at the same time allowed\r\nher every possible indulgence, he might continue to go on his own way and\r\ntake his pleasure in whatever form he chose. But he soon found out his\r\nmistake. This young wife of his, full of mirth and high spirits as she\r\nwas, had a deeper nature and a stronger will than he suspected. If a\r\nconstant round of amusements could have satisfied her, she might have\r\naccepted the playful caresses of her indulgent husband, and been content\r\nwith the share of affection which he bestowed upon her. But Beatrice\r\nasked for more than this. She was bent on having sole possession of her\r\nlord's heart--of reigning there at least without a rival. And when she\r\ndiscovered that Lodovico had a mistress actually living in the Castello,\r\nwhom he visited constantly and loved passionately, her whole being rose\r\nup in arms. Her proud spirit would not brook a rival, and she vowed the\r\nduke must choose between his mistress and his wife. When the Ferrarese\r\nenvoy saw the newly wedded duke on his way to Cecilia Gallerani's rooms\r\nwithin a month after his marriage, he was full of gloomy forebodings.\r\nBut Lodovico was perfectly frank with him, and did not attempt to conceal\r\nhis actions or the motives of his conduct. For a while Beatrice spent her\r\ntime riding or hunting about the country with Messer Galeazzo and her\r\nladies, and remained in happy ignorance of the true state of affairs. But\r\nthis could not last long. Soon a rumour of Cecilia's presence in the\r\nRocca reached her ears; she heard how often the duke was seen in her\r\ncompany, and was told that before many weeks were over his mistress was\r\nlikely to bear him a child. The first intimation which we have of this\r\nrude awakening which had come to the young duchess is in a letter\r\naddressed by Trotti to Duke Ercole, which he sends in the strictest\r\nconfidence, begging his master to allow no one but our illustrious Madonna\r\nto read it, and then to burn it without delay.[12] In this letter he says\r\nthat Beatrice has absolutely refused to wear a certain vest of woven gold\r\nwhich her husband had given her, if Madonna Cecilia ever appeared in a\r\nsimilar one, which it seems was also Lodovico's present. The duke himself,\r\nhe adds, had been to see him that day, and had promised faithfully that he\r\nwould put an end to his _liaison_ with Cecilia, and would either marry\r\nher to one of his courtiers or desire her to become a nun. Lodovico, it\r\nis plain, had realized that the situation had become impossible, and\r\nthat he could not keep up his relations with his old mistress without\r\ncausing open scandal. He was true to his promise, and that carnival he\r\nbroke off the connection which gave Beatrice so much pain, and wrote to\r\nGiacomo Trotti from Vigevano on the 27th of March, informing him that he\r\nhad decided not to see Madonna Cecilia again, and that after her child's\r\nbirth she had agreed to become the wife of Count Lodovico Bergamini. This\r\nstrange compact was duly carried out.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of May, the duke's discarded mistress gave birth to a son,\r\nwho received the name of Cesare; and in the following July, Cecilia\r\nGallerani was married to Count Lodovico Bergamini of Cremona, one of the\r\nMoro's most loyal servants and subjects. Her trousseau on this occasion\r\nwas of the most sumptuous description, and it was noticed that the\r\ncorbeille which held her gowns bore the ducal arms. At the same time the\r\nDuke of Bari presented her with the stately Palazzo del Verme,\r\noriginally built by his ancestor, Filippo Maria Visconti, for the great\r\nCaptain Carmagnola, on the _piazza_ of the Duomo, as a token of his\r\nregard and a heritage for her infant son. Court painters and sculptors\r\nwere employed to decorate the halls and porticoes with frescoes and\r\nmedallions of the finest marble, and at the time of the French invasion,\r\neight years later, Countess Bergamini's palace was described as the\r\nfinest private house in Milan. Cecilia devoted herself to the classical\r\nstudies in which she had taken delight from her earliest youth, and\r\nentertained her learned friends in her town house or at her villa near\r\nCremona until she died in advanced old age, some years after the last of\r\nLodovico's sons had ceased to reign over Milan. Lodovico seems to have\r\nkept his promise loyally, but always treated Cecilia and her husband\r\nwith marked favour, and acknowledged the boy Cesare as his own son.\r\n\r\nA curious letter addressed to him by the poet Bellincioni, in February,\r\n1492, when the duke was absent from Milan for a few days, begins by\r\ninforming Lodovico that he has given Duchess Beatrice a pastoral which\r\nshe wishes to send her husband, and goes on to say that he was dining\r\nyesterday with Madonna Cecilia. He tells Lodovico how he had seen her\r\nson Cesare, who had grown into a very fine child--\"_quale è grasso, dico\r\ngrasso!_\"--and how he had made the little fellow laugh. In the same\r\nletter he complains of all that he has to suffer at the hands of envious\r\ndetractors, and by way of ingratiating himself with the duke, reminds\r\nhis Highness that he had always prophesied Madonna Cecilia's child would\r\nprove to be a boy. Bellincioni himself composed several sonnets in\r\nhonour of Cesare's birth and of his accomplished mother. And among the\r\nexquisite miniatures of the little Maximilian Sforza's Libro del Gesù in\r\nthe Trivulzian library, we find a picture of Lodovico and Beatrice's\r\nchild sitting at dinner with his mother and a lady bearing the name of\r\nCecilia, in whom tradition sees the duke's old mistress, Countess\r\nBergamini.\r\n\r\nBut although Cecilia remained at court, and even maintained friendly\r\nrelations with her famous lover, she never seems to have given Beatrice\r\ncause for jealousy again, and her name is never again mentioned in\r\nGiacomo Trotti's confidential despatches to his master. Only the\r\nsingular fact that Beatrice d'Este's portrait was never, so far as we\r\nknow, painted by Leonardo, the supreme master at her husband's court,\r\nmay well be owing to the remembrance that he had formerly painted\r\nCecilia Gallerani. The proud young duchess who would not wear a robe\r\nsimilar to that bestowed upon his mistress by her husband, may naturally\r\nenough have declined to have her portrait painted by the same artist,\r\nhowever excellent a master he might be. But whether or no this was the\r\ntrue reason of this strange omission, there was certainly no portrait of\r\nBeatrice d'Este by Leonardo's hand in Milan a year after her death, or\r\nher own sister Isabella would not have applied to Cecilia Gallerani for\r\nthe loan of her picture as an example of Leonardo's art. From this time,\r\nhowever, the young duchess succeeded in winning her husband's heart, and\r\nfor many years to come retained undivided possession of his roving\r\naffections. On the 20th of April, Trotti wrote to Ferrara that Signor\r\nLodovico had been to see him on the second or third day in Easter week,\r\nand had spoken with the greatest warmth and affection of his wife, with\r\nwhom he spent his whole time, and whose charming ways and manners gave\r\nhim the greatest pleasure. Madonna Beatrice is, as he says, not only of\r\na joyous nature, but of noble and elevated mind, and at the same time\r\nvery pleasing and no less modest. And in May, when Cecilia's son was\r\nborn, the duke himself told his wife the news, repeating his\r\ndetermination never again to renew the old connection. His letters to\r\nIsabella d'Este abound in the same expressions of genuine love and\r\nadmiration for his young wife. He is never tired of dwelling on her\r\nperfections, on her courage and fine horsemanship, and looks on with an\r\nindulgent smile at her wildest freaks and escapades.\r\n\r\nEarly in March he and Beatrice went to Vigevano, accompanied as usual by\r\nMesser Galeazzo and a few courtiers and ladies. All his life Lodovico\r\nretained especial affection for this old Lombard town, where he had been\r\nborn, and which he had greatly improved and beautified during the last\r\nfew years. By his care the streets were paved, and new houses erected;\r\nthe buildings of the ancient Forum, which dated back to Roman times,\r\nwere restored; and the church repaired and adorned with pictures, and\r\ndecorated by the hand of the sculptor Cristoforo Romano.\r\n\r\n\"At Vigevano,\" writes the contemporary Milanese chronicler Cagnola, \"a\r\nplace very dear to the house of Sforza, Lodovico made a fair and large\r\n_piazza_, and adorned it with many noble buildings and a fine park,\r\nwhich he filled with beasts of prey for the pleasure of the ducal\r\nfamily. He also laid out some most beautiful gardens, and since all this\r\ncountry was very dry and arid, he constructed aqueducts with great\r\nartifice and ingenuity, and brought water into the place in such\r\nabundance that these lands, which had hitherto been sterile and barren,\r\nbore fruit in great quantities. And so entirely did he improve and alter\r\nthe whole place that, instead of Vigevano, it might well be called\r\n_Citta nova_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time Lodovico rebuilt on a magnificent scale the old castle\r\nwhich crowns the heights above the valley of the Ticino, and employed\r\nBramante to design the lofty tower and the arcaded courts with delicate\r\ntraceries and terra-cotta mouldings in the finest Lombard style. This\r\nfavourite palace of the Moro's has been turned into a barrack, and\r\nlittle remains of its former splendour; but Bramante's tower is still\r\nstanding, and on the north gate of the keep we may read a significant\r\ninscription placed there by the citizens of Vigevano, recording the many\r\nbenefactions of this most illustrious duke, who loved his native city so\r\nwell, and was never tired of heaping benefactions on her people. \"By his\r\ncare not only was this splendid house raised from the ground, and the\r\nsquare of the old Forum restored to its pristine shape, but the course\r\nof rivers was turned, and flowing streams of water were brought into\r\nthis dry and barren land. The desert waste became a green and fertile\r\nmeadow, \"the wilderness rejoiced and blossomed as the rose.\"\r\n\r\nThe same sentiments inspired the verses in which Galeotto del Carretto,\r\none of the most accomplished poets of Beatrice's court, celebrated\r\nLodovico's improvements in this his favourite country house:\r\n\r\n    \"Vigevano, che gia fu gleba vile,\r\n    Ha fatto adorno, e gli agri a quel contigui\r\n    Ha coltivati con saper utile,\r\n    E i steril campi, e al far fructo ambigui\r\n    Fertili ha facto et abondanti prati,\r\n    E d'acqua ticinèse tutti irigui.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Cagnola and Galeotto refer, no doubt, to the vast system of\r\nirrigation which Lodovico constructed at immense pains and expense to\r\nfertilize this district of Lomellina, and which may well have earned the\r\ngratitude of its inhabitants. The great Naviglio Sforzesca, which has\r\nresisted the ravages of time, formed part of this admirable system, and\r\nwas probably constructed under the supervision of Leonardo, who was\r\noften at Vigevano with Lodovico, and who in later years became his chief\r\nengineer. It was here, in the immediate neighbourhood of Vigevano, that\r\nLodovico established his model farm for the encouragement of agriculture.\r\nLike all the Moro's other undertakings, this was planned on a splendid\r\nscale. The villa itself was an imposing quadrangular building, with four\r\nlofty towers, and a noble gateway adorned with a Latin inscription cut in\r\ngold letters on a tablet of massive marble, and bearing the date 1486.\r\nThese lines, composed at the duke's request by Ermolao Barbaro, the\r\nlearned Venetian scholar, who was a personal friend of his, and\r\nrepresented the republic at his court, record how Lodovico, the son of\r\none Sforza Duke of Milan, and uncle and guardian of another, brought\r\nwater to fertilize this barren province, and was the builder of this\r\nfair house, \"_villaque amenissima a fundamentis erecta_.\" In order to\r\ncarry out his schemes, the duke acquired a large extent of land in the\r\nneighbourhood, partly by purchase, and partly by the confiscation of\r\nterritory, which, as Corio remarks, naturally provoked much discontent\r\namong individuals, and did not help to increase Lodovico's popularity,\r\nalthough in the end it largely benefited both the state and posterity.\r\nHe proceeded to dig canals, and bring water on the one side by the\r\nNaviglio Sforzesca from the Ticino, and on the other by the Mora Canal\r\nfrom the Val Seria. Then, with the help of exports from Vicenza and\r\nVerona, he introduced the culture of the mulberry with excellent\r\nresults, and planted large vineyards. Here he tried various experiments\r\nin the culture of the vine, such, for instance, as that of burying vines\r\nin winter, which Leonardo noted down when he visited Vigevano in March,\r\n1492. At the same time Lodovico brought vast flocks of sheep from\r\nLanguedoc, and built the large farm known as La Pecorara, close to the\r\nnew villa. La Grange, as they called this farm, aroused the admiration\r\nof the French chroniclers who followed Louis XII. in his invasion of\r\nLombardy, more than any other of the beautiful and marvellous houses and\r\nenchanted gardens which they saw in this wonderful land of Milan. Robert\r\nGaguin cannot find words in which to express his amazement at the\r\nmarvellous number of beasts that he saw there--horses, mares, oxen,\r\ncows, bulls, rams, ewes, goats, and other beasts with their young, such\r\nas fawns, calves, foals, lambs, and kids--or the massive pillars and\r\nlofty vaulting of the stables, which are described as being larger than\r\nthe whole of the Carthusian convent in Paris.\r\n\r\n\"The farm itself,\" he writes, \"is finely situated in a wide meadow about\r\nfour leagues in circumference, with no less than thirty-three streams of\r\nfair running water flowing through the pastures, and well adapted for\r\nthe practical uses of agriculture, since they serve for the bathing and\r\ncleansing of the animals as well as for the watering of the grass. The\r\nplan of the farm-buildings is a large square, like some noble cloister,\r\nand in the park outside are barns and ricks of hay and other produce. In\r\nthe central courtyard are the houses of the governors and captains who\r\ndirect all the work on the farm. In the outhouses, which are built in\r\nthe shape of a great cross, the labourers have their homes, together\r\nwith their wives and families. Some of these clean and tend the cattle\r\nor groom the horses. Others milk the herds of cows at the proper time.\r\nOthers, again, receive the milk and bear it into the dairies, where it\r\nis made into the great cheeses which they call here Milan cheeses, under\r\nthe superintendence of the master cheese-maker. The exact weight of\r\neverything, that is to say, of the hay, milk, butter, and cheese, is\r\ncarefully recorded, and there is an extraordinary wealth and abundance\r\nof all these things.\"\r\n\r\nThese Milan cheeses were so highly esteemed by the French invaders in\r\n1499, that Louis XII. took back a large quantity with him to Blois, and\r\nkept them for several years in a room especially devoted to that\r\npurpose. They were preserved in oil, and are mentioned in one of his\r\nwife Anne of Brittany's inventories of the year 1504.\r\n\r\nSuch were the manifold industries which this far-seeing prince\r\nestablished on his royal domain, less, as he said, for actual profit\r\nthan for the encouragement of better methods in agriculture and the\r\npromotion of his poorer subjects' prosperity. And over all he kept the\r\nsame keen and vigilant eye, paying attention to every detail and\r\nproviding for every contingency. The management of this model farm and\r\nthe progress of the extensive works that were being executed in the new\r\npalace of Vigevano filled every moment that he could spare from affairs\r\nof state at Milan. But on this occasion his especial object in visiting\r\nhis native city was, as he tells Isabella d'Este, to stock the park with\r\ngame of all kinds--deer, chamois, hare, and pheasants--as well as the\r\nwild boars and wolves for the more serious sport known as _la grande\r\ncaccia_.\r\n\r\n\"I am hoping to go to Vigevano on Monday,\" he writes from Milan on the\r\n26th of February, \"with my wife, and intend to make extensive preparations\r\nfor fresh hunting-parties, so that when you are here we may be able to\r\ngive you the more pleasure. As for my wife, I really believe that since\r\nyour departure she has not let a single day pass without mounting her\r\nhorse!\" And later in the summer he says, \"My wife has become so clever at\r\nhawking that she quite outdoes me at this her favourite sport.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice herself gives a lively account of her country life during the\r\nspring of 1491, in a charming letter which she addressed to her sister\r\nfrom Villa Nova, another of Lodovico's delightful pleasure-houses in the\r\nvalley of the Ticino between Milan and Pavia.\r\n\r\n\"I am now here at Villa Nova, where the loveliness of the country and\r\nthe balmy sweetness of the air make me think we are already in the month\r\nof May, so warm and splendid is the weather we are enjoying! Every day\r\nwe go out riding with the dogs and falcons, and my husband and I never\r\ncome home without having enjoyed ourselves exceedingly in hunting herons\r\nand other water-fowl. I cannot say much of the perils of the chase,\r\nsince game is so plentiful here that hares are to be seen jumping out at\r\nevery corner--so much so, that often we hardly know which way to turn to\r\nfind the best sport. Indeed, the eye cannot take in all one desires to\r\nsee, and it is scarcely possible to count up the number of animals that\r\nare to be found in this neighbourhood. Nor must I forget to tell you how\r\nevery day Messer Galeazzo and I, with one or two other courtiers, amuse\r\nourselves playing at ball after dinner, and we often talk of your\r\nHighness, and wish that you were here. I say all this, not to diminish\r\nthe pleasure that I hope you will have when you do come by telling you\r\nwhat you may expect to find here, but in order that you may know how\r\nwell and happy I am, and how kind and affectionate my husband is, since\r\nI cannot thoroughly enjoy any pleasure or happiness unless I share it\r\nwith you. And I must tell you that I have had a whole field of garlic\r\nplanted for your benefit, so that when you come, we may be able to have\r\nplenty of your favourite dishes![13]\r\n\r\n\"Ex Villa Nova, 18 Martiji, 1491.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain from this letter that harmony had been restored between the\r\nwedded pair, and that the rock on which Beatrice's happiness had seemed\r\nlikely to founder had been fortunately avoided.\r\n\r\nThe passing cloud that cast a shadow on her bright young life had rolled\r\naway, and this letter breathes the serene happiness of the spring airs\r\nabout her. But her affection for her sister was warmer and stronger than\r\never, and hardly a day passed without some fresh expression of her\r\nimpatience for Isabella's return--an impatience which both Lodovico and\r\nGaleazzo seem to have shared.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April, after describing a successful wolf-hunt from\r\nVigevano, in which the Duke and Duchess of Milan and their courtiers had\r\nall taken part, Lodovico writes--\r\n\r\n\"The whole distance must have been at least thirty miles, yet on the way\r\nhome both the duchesses stayed behind the rest of us, to make their\r\nhorses race one against the other; and if your Highness had been here, I\r\nthink you would have entered the lists and tried your luck against them.\r\nAnd since you must come soon, and are expected by us impatiently, I will\r\nremind your Highness to bring some of those fine Barbary steeds which\r\nyour illustrious lord the marquis keeps in his stables, and then you\r\nwill easily be able to beat all the others.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 16th of May, Lodovico writes in the same strain--\r\n\r\n\"I am as sorry as you are that you could not be here for these\r\nwolf-hunts, because, as you said in the letter written with your own\r\nhand on the 5th instant, I am quite sure you would have given us proofs\r\nof your spirit and courage. I must, however, tell you that your sister's\r\nboldness is such that I think even you would hardly come off victor in\r\nthis contest, especially as, since you were here, she has made great\r\nprogress both in the arts of horsemanship and of hunting. All the same,\r\nI am so impatient to see you together and to match your courage one\r\nagainst the other, that it seems to me a thousand years until your\r\narrival!\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice, it appears, was absolutely fearless in the presence of danger,\r\nand faced an angry boar or wounded stag with the same lightness of\r\nheart. The greater the risks she ran, the higher her spirits rose. This\r\nfeature of his young wife's character aroused the Moro's highest\r\nadmiration. In a letter of the 8th of July, after recounting the various\r\nincidents of a long day's hunting, he tells the Marchesa what a narrow\r\nescape Beatrice has had from an infuriated stag which gored her horse.\r\n\r\n\"All at once we heard that the wounded stag had been seen, and had\r\nattacked the horse which my wife was riding, and the next moment we saw\r\nher lifted up in the air a good lance's height from the ground; but she\r\nkept her seat, and sat erect all the while. The duke and duchess and I\r\nall rushed to her help, and asked if she were hurt; but she only\r\nlaughed, and was not in the least frightened.\"[14]\r\n\r\nIsabella herself was burning with eager desire to join Lodovico and\r\nBeatrice in these hunting-parties, and have a share in the thrilling\r\nadventures which they narrated in their letters, But her husband the\r\nmarquis was away all the spring and early summer; first at Bologna,\r\nwhere he attended his brother Giovanni Gonzaga's wedding, and afterwards\r\nwith his sister the Duchess Elizabeth at Urbino. After his return to\r\nMantua he fell ill, and when he recovered it was already late in August,\r\nand Isabella was compelled very reluctantly to decline Lodovico Sforza's\r\npressing invitations. Money was scarce at the court of Mantua, and the\r\nexpenses of a journey to Milan were heavy. So she contented herself with\r\ngoing to see her mother that autumn at Ferrara, and put off her visit to\r\nMilan until the following spring, much to the disappointment of Beatrice\r\nand her husband. Lodovico wrote her word that he had been arranging a\r\ntournament at Pavia in honour of the christening of Gian Galeazzo's son,\r\nthe little Count of Pavia, but that since she would not come, he had\r\nmade up his mind to put it off and have no jousting.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] G.

This princess, who was Beatrice's\r\nfirst cousin and only five years older than Lodovico's wife, is\r\nmentioned not only as present with her husband at all court festivities\r\nand hunting-parties, but as her constant companion in all her\r\noccupations and amusements, both at Vigevano and Pavia. In after-days,\r\nwhen Lodovico had a son of his own and was suspected of designs on the\r\nducal crown, Duchess Isabella bitterly resented his conduct and that of\r\nhis wife. But there is absolutely no foundation for Corio's statement\r\nthat this rivalry between the two duchesses began at the time of\r\nBeatrice's wedding, and that from the moment of her arrival at Milan,\r\nLodovico's wife objected to yield precedence to the Duchess of Milan.\r\nThe Milanese chronicler wrote after Lodovico's fall, and always assumed\r\nthe truth of the worst charges brought against the Moro and his wife.\r\nUnfortunately, his hasty and inaccurate statements have been repeated by\r\nGuicciardini and other contemporaries, and accepted as literally true by\r\nlater writers. In this case Corio probably looked back on the past\r\nthrough the medium of the present, and judged the actors in the drama by\r\nthe light of their later conduct. In any case, there is absolutely no\r\ntrace of any jealousy or rivalry between the two young duchesses in the\r\nprivate letters and court records of the period. On the contrary,\r\nIsabella seems to have welcomed her cousin's presence joyfully, and to\r\nhave found that the dull life which she led by the side of her feeble\r\nhusband was sensibly brightened by Beatrice's company.\r\n\r\nBellincioni, whose verses certainly mirror the court life of the day, if\r\nthey also breathe the incense of flattery, wrote several sonnets in\r\nwhich he descants on the close friendship and companionship of the two\r\nduchesses, and the love that bound them together in the tender bonds of\r\nsisterly affection. He is never tired of praising the concord that\r\nreigned in the ducal family, and the pleasure that Beatrice took in\r\nIsabella's little son, who was constantly seen in her arms.\r\n\r\n\"And when the ladies ask if she does not wish for a son of her own, she\r\nreplies in sweet accents, 'This one child is enough for me;' and\r\nstraightway all her courtiers repeat and extol her answer.\"\r\n\r\nBut more trustworthy than the rhymes of court poets is the evidence to\r\nbe found in the letters describing the daily round of life at Milan or\r\nPavia and Vigevano. Here Isabella and Beatrice are mentioned as joining\r\nin the same games and sports, whether playing at ball, sometimes even\r\ntrying their strength in wrestling matches.\r\n\r\n\"The two duchesses,\" writes the Ferrarese ambassador, on the 28th of\r\nApril, \"have been having a sparring match, and the Duke of Bari's wife\r\nhas knocked down her of Milan.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes their escapades were of a decidedly undignified order. But\r\npractical jokes were much in vogue among these exalted lords and ladies\r\nof the Renaissance. For instance, we find Beatrice's brother Alfonso and\r\nMesser Galeazzo, disguised as robbers, breaking into the house of\r\nGirolamo Tuttavilla, one of Lodovico's favourite ministers, at midnight,\r\nand leading him blindfold on a donkey through the streets of Milan and\r\ninto the Castello, where he was released amid peals of laughter. And the\r\ntwo young duchesses seem to have celebrated this Eastertide, which they\r\nspent at Milan, by the wildest freaks.\r\n\r\n\"There is literally no end to the pleasures and amusements which we\r\nhave here,\" writes Lodovico, on the 12th of April, to his sister-in-law\r\nat Mantua. \"I could not tell you one-thousandth part of the tricks and\r\ngames in which the Duchess of Milan and my wife indulge. In the country\r\nthey spent their time in riding races and galloping up behind their\r\nladies at full speed, so as to make them fall off their horses. And now\r\nthat we are back here in Milan, they are always inventing some new forms\r\nof amusement. They started yesterday in the rain on foot, with five or\r\nsix of their ladies, wearing cloths or towels over their heads, and\r\nwalked through the streets of the city to buy provisions. But since it\r\nis not the custom for women to wear cloths on their heads here, some of\r\nthe women in the street began to laugh at them and make rude remarks,\r\nupon which my wife fired up and replied in the same manner, so much so\r\nthat they almost came to blows. In the end they came home all muddy and\r\nbedraggled, and were a fine sight! I believe, when your Highness is\r\nhere, they will go out with all the more courage, since they will have\r\nin you so bold and spirited a comrade, and if any one dares to be rude\r\nto you, they will get back as good as they give! From your affectionate\r\nbrother,\r\n\r\n                                                       \"Lodovico.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIsabella, for all her wisdom and prudence, does not seem to have been in\r\nthe least scandalized by her sister's behaviour, and replied that she\r\nwould have done worse if any one had ventured to insult her; upon which\r\nLodovico remarked--\r\n\r\n\"Your letter in answer to my description of my wife and the duchess\r\nwalking about Milan with cloths on their heads, delighted me. I am sure\r\nyou have far too much spirit to allow rude things to be said to you, and\r\nwhen I read your letter, I could see the angry flash in your eye, and\r\nhear the indignant answer that you would have had in readiness for any\r\none who dared insult you.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter we give was written on the 12th of June, from the\r\nCastello di Pavia, where the ducal family spent that summer, and is of\r\nspecial interest on account of the allusions which it contains to the\r\nfamous sanctuary of the Certosa.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent several days lately at the Certosa, which your Highness,\r\nI know, visited when you were last here. And since I did not think the\r\nchoir-stalls in the church were in any way suitable or equal in beauty\r\nto the rest of the building, I went back there the day before yesterday\r\nand had them taken down, and have ordered new stalls to be designed in\r\ntheir place. And as I was returning, the duke and duchess and my wife\r\ncame to meet me, and attacked me suddenly, and in order to defend\r\nmyself, I divided my retainers, who were most of them riding mules, into\r\nthree squadrons, and charged the enemy in due order, so there was a fine\r\nscuffle! Then we came home to see some youths run races, with lances in\r\ntheir hands, and after that we went to supper. And since those\r\nillustrious duchesses took it into their heads to return again to the\r\nCertosa, they went back there yesterday morning, and when it was time\r\nfor them to return, I went out to meet them, and found that both\r\nduchesses and all their ladies were dressed in Turkish costumes. These\r\ndisguises were invented by my wife, who had all the dresses made in one\r\nnight! It seems that when they began to set to work about noon\r\nyesterday, the Duchess of Milan could not contain her amazement at\r\nseeing my wife sewing with as much vigour and energy as any old woman.\r\nAnd my wife told her that, whatever she did, whether it were jest or\r\nearnest, she liked to throw her whole heart into it and try and do it as\r\nwell as possible. Certainly in this case she succeeded perfectly, and\r\nthe skill and grace with which she carried out her idea gave me\r\nindescribable pleasure and satisfaction.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe passage is eminently characteristic both of the Moro and his wife.\r\nWe see on the one hand the spirit and resolution which made Beatrice, in\r\nthe words of the Emperor Maximilian, not merely a sweet and loving wife\r\nto her lord, but a partner who shared actively in all his schemes and\r\nlightened every burden; and on the other, we understand the admiration\r\nwhich this force of character and tenacity of purpose excited in\r\nLodovico's weaker and more easily swayed nature. Beatrice's masquerade\r\nrecalls another curious feature of the day--that taste for Turkish\r\ncostumes and interest in Oriental habits which had sprung up in Italy\r\nduring the forty years which had elapsed since the fall of\r\nConstantinople. In Venice, Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio were already\r\nshowing signs of this familiarity with Eastern habits by the Turkish\r\ncostumes and personages who figure in their pictures; and a troop of\r\nTurks were introduced into a masque written by the Milanese poet,\r\nGaspare Visconti, and acted before the Court. These strangers from the\r\nfar East, attracted by the fame of the great city of Milan, were\r\nsupposed to arrive in a boat on the Lombard shores, singing the\r\nfollowing chorus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bel paese è Lombardia\r\n    Degno assai, ricca e galante.\r\n      Ma di gioie la Soria\r\n    E di fructi è più abbondante\r\n      Tanta fama è per il mondo\r\n    Del gran vostro alto Milano,\r\n      Che solcando il mar profondo;\r\n    Siam venuti da lontano,\r\n      Gran paese soriano,\r\n    Per veder se cosi sia,\r\n      Bel paese di Lombardia.\"\r\n\r\nStill greater interest attaches to Lodovico's description of his own\r\nvisit to the Certosa and of the alterations which he effected in the\r\nchoir. This famous church and monastery had been the pride of successive\r\nDukes of Milan, since the day when Galeazzo Visconti laid the first\r\nstone in his park of Pavia a hundred years before. Viscontis and Sforzas\r\nhad alike helped to enrich their ancestor's mighty foundation, and to\r\ncarry on the work. But the Certosa owes more to Lodovico Sforza than to\r\nany other member of the dynasty. From the day when he returned to Milan\r\nand took up the reins of government in his nephew's name, to the last\r\nsad moments when his state was crumbling to pieces, this great shrine\r\nwas the special object of his solicitude. In his eyes, as he said in the\r\nletter informing the Prior and brothers of Duchess Leonora's visit, the\r\nCertosa was the jewel of the crown, the noblest monument in the whole\r\nrealm. The completion of the façade and the internal decoration of the\r\ngreat church and chapels was one of the objects that lay nearest to his\r\nheart. A whole army of architects and sculptors, painters and builders\r\nwere employed under his orders; and so great was the store of precious\r\nmarbles, brought there from Carrara and other parts of Italy, that the\r\nplace was said to resemble a vast stone quarry. During the twenty years\r\nthat the Moro reigned as Regent and Duke in Milan, the new apse built in\r\nBramante's classical style, the central cupola, and the beautiful\r\ncloisters with their slender marble shafts and dark red terra-cotta\r\nfriezes of angel-heads, all rose into being. Then Ambrogio Borgognone\r\ndecorated the roof of nave and apse, and designed the elaborate\r\n_intarsiatura_ of these very choir-stalls to which Lodovico alludes in\r\nhis letter to Isabella d'Este. And then the same Lombard master painted\r\nthese frescoes and altar-pieces of grave saints and gentle Madonnas,\r\nwhich still adorn the side chapels with their solemn forms and rich\r\ngolden harmonies. Many of these are ruined, others we know are gone. The\r\nfragments of the noble banners with portraits of kneeling figures, which\r\nthe artist painted for processional use on solemn occasions are now in\r\nour National Gallery. There, too, is that loveliest of all Perugino's\r\nMadonnas, with the warrior Archangels at her side, and the perfect\r\nlandscape beyond, which the Umbrian master painted in the last years of\r\nthe century, by the Moro's express command, for his favourite sanctuary.\r\n\r\nBut the crowning work of Lodovico's days was the façade of the great\r\nchurch which, after many different attempts, was finally begun in 1491,\r\nand mostly executed during the next seven years. This magnificent\r\ncreation, the triumph of Lombard genius, was designed by a native\r\narchitect, Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, or Di Madeo, as he signs himself, a\r\npeasant lad who had grown up in his father's farm close by, and whose\r\nearliest independent work is said to have been a group of angels on the\r\nmarble doorway leading from the church into the cloisters. He had\r\nafterwards been employed at Bergamo, where the Colleoni Chapel and the\r\neffigy of the great Condottiere's young daughter, the sleeping virgin\r\nMedea, still bear witness to his poetic invention and rare decorative\r\nskill. One of Lodovico's first acts after his return to Milan had been\r\nto recall Amadeo to Pavia, and in 1490, this gifted artist was appointed\r\n_Capo maestro_ of the Certosa works. To his delicate fancy and exquisite\r\nrefinement we owe much of the lovely detail in the church and cloisters,\r\nthe singing angels of the portals, the reliefs on Gian Galeazzo's\r\nmonument, and in the monks' lavatory, and the medallions of the Sforzas\r\nover the doorways of the choir. There we may see the strongly marked\r\nfeatures and refined expression of the great Moro, between his brother\r\nand his nephew, while above the opposite portal are the four Duchesses\r\nof Milan, Bianca Maria Visconti, Bona of Savoy, Isabella of Aragon, and\r\nBeatrice d'Este with the same soft, beautiful face, the same long coil\r\nof hair and jewelled net that we see in her portrait in the Brera or in\r\nCristoforo Romano's bust in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nBut the wonderful marble façade, with its great central portal and\r\nround-headed windows, its historical reliefs and marvellous wealth of\r\ndecorative sculpture, is Amadeo's grandest creation. We know not how far\r\nit was completed before 1499, when his labours as chief architect of the\r\ncathedrals of Milan and Pavia compelled him to give up his post at the\r\nCertosa; but in much of the ornamental detail--in the angels that adorn\r\nits branches of the candelabra between the windows, in the profusion of\r\ncarved trophies, armorial bearings, burning censers, cherub-heads,\r\nleaf-mouldings, flowers and fruit that has been lavished on every\r\nportion of the west front we recognize his handiwork. And this façade of\r\nthe Certosa, more than any other architectural work of the age, bears\r\nthe stamp of Lodovico Sforza's peculiar genius. Alike in the abundance\r\nof classical motives and in the amazing wealth of invention and infinite\r\ngrace that inspired the whole conception, we recognize Lodovico's\r\npassionate love of the antique and minute attention to detail. We know\r\nthat he was constantly on the spot, as the letter to his sister-in-law\r\nproves, and that when absent from Pavia the works of the Certosa were\r\nconstantly in his mind. He was always writing orders to Amadeo to buy\r\nmarbles and hurry on the work, always urging the prior to hasten the\r\ncompletion of the church, or inquiring in Florence and Rome for new\r\nmasters to paint altar-pieces for the Certosa. And to-day, when so many\r\nof his noblest creations have perished, when the glorious pile of the\r\nCastello of Milan, with its stately towers and frescoed halls, rich\r\ndecorations and vast gardens, has been defaced and battered by the hands\r\nof barbarian invaders, when Leonardo's fresco is a wreck and the tomb\r\nof Beatrice broken to pieces, when Vigevano and Cussago are in ruins,\r\nand the matchless library of Pavia has been scattered to the winds, we\r\nrejoice to think that the Certosa remains to show us how splendid were\r\nthe dreams and how rare the skill of artists in the days when Lodovico\r\nSforza reigned over Milan.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest artists who was working at the Certosa under\r\nLodovico's eye in the summer of 1491, was the accomplished Roman\r\nsculptor, Giovanni Cristoforo Romano. We remember how he had been sent\r\nto Ferrara in the autumn of the previous year to execute a bust of\r\nBeatrice for his master. Since then he had gone back to his work at the\r\nCertosa, where he was employed upon the monument which Lodovico was\r\nraising to his ancestor Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the founder of the great\r\nCarthusian Abbey. His exact share in this noble work, which was begun in\r\n1490, remains uncertain, but both the effigy of this duke and the figure\r\nof the Madonna and Child in the upper part of the monument are generally\r\nascribed to his hand. At the same time Cristoforo had promised to design\r\nthe chief portal of the ancient Stanga palace in Cremona, which was\r\nbeing restored by Lodovico's Superintendent of Finances, the Marchese\r\nStanga, known in court circles as the Marchesino, to distinguish him\r\nfrom his father, Duchess Bianca Maria's faithful servant. That June the\r\nMarchesino was married at Milan to a daughter of Count Giovanni\r\nBorromeo, and on this occasion, doubtless, he employed the gifted Roman\r\nsculptor to design the magnificent doorway which now adorns the Louvre\r\nand is a masterpiece of classic elegance. But now a fresh invitation\r\nreached Cristoforo from another quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness of Mantua had seen the Roman master's bust of her sister\r\nBeatrice when she came to Milan in the winter for the wedding\r\nfestivities, and was seized with an ardent wish to have her features\r\ncarved in marble by the same unrivalled artist. On the 22nd of June she\r\nwrote to Beatrice from her favourite villa at Porto, near Mantua,\r\nbegging her to ask Lodovico if he would kindly allow \"that excellent\r\nmaster, Johan Cristoforo, who carved your Highness's portrait in\r\nmarble,\" to come to Mantua for a few days, that he might render her the\r\nsame service. Beatrice, who was always ready and anxious to gratify\r\nIsabella's wishes, replied that she had shown the letter at once to her\r\nhusband, and that Lodovico would gladly comply with her sister's\r\nrequest, and had written to beg the Marchesino--for whom Johan\r\nCristoforo was working at that moment--to send this master to Mantua.\r\n\"No doubt by this time,\" he adds, writing from Pavia on the 15th of\r\nJuly, \"Messer Cristoforo is already on his way to Mantua.\"\r\n\r\nBut the sculptor, like most great artists, took his time about his work,\r\nand would not be interrupted or hurried, even to please so charming and\r\nillustrious a lady as Isabella d'Este. He wrote a courteous note to the\r\nMarchesa from Pavia, saying how gladly he would have obeyed her summons\r\non the spot, and how deeply he regretted that this was impossible, since\r\nhe could not leave the work upon which he was engaged for the Marchesino\r\nunfinished. But he hoped to have the pleasure of seeing her some day.\r\nMeanwhile he suggested that she should order two pieces of fine marble\r\nfrom Venice, and see that they were very white and without stain or vein\r\nof colour. Isabella, however, was not easily discouraged, especially\r\nwhere excellent masters and works of art were in question, and, as she\r\nwrote on another occasion to Niccolo da Correggio, liked to have her\r\nwishes gratified on the spot. This time she wrote to the Marchesino\r\nhimself, begging him to send Messer Johan Cristoforo to Mantua as soon\r\nas possible. Now Giovanni Stanga, besides being a finished courtier, was\r\non intimate terms with the fair Marchesana herself and with all her\r\nfamily. Only a few weeks before, Isabella had written him a charming\r\nletter of congratulation on his marriage, and he often sent presents of\r\nsilver boxes and ornaments both to her and Duchess Leonora. So, when his\r\nown doorway was finished, he did his best to induce the sculptor to\r\noblige the marchioness. But Cristoforo had evidently no intention of\r\nleaving Pavia at present. The summer months slipped away, and still\r\nIsabella waited in vain. At length, in October, she heard from the\r\nMarchesino that Messer Cristoforo feared it was impossible for him to\r\ncome to Mantua at all this year, since his whole time was spent in\r\nworking at the Certosa, besides which he was one of the Duchess of\r\nBari's singers, and must obey her wishes and travel with her, now in\r\none direction, now in another. \"At present,\" adds the writer, \"he is\r\nwith her in Genoa.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not, in fact, until after Beatrice's death that Isabella obtained\r\nLodovico's leave for his favourite sculptor to visit Mantua. By that\r\ntime the duke's affairs were in dire confusion, and seeing there was\r\nlittle hope of further employment and none of certain pay, Messer\r\nCristoforo left the Milanese court sorrowfully and went to Mantua, where\r\nhe carved the lovely doorway still to be seen in Isabella's studio of\r\n_Il Paradiso_ at the top of the grim old Castello, and designed the\r\nbeautiful medal of the marchioness herself, which was praised as a\r\ndivine thing at the Court of Naples, and which the old scholar Jacopo\r\nd'Atri kissed a thousand times over, for the sake of its beauty and of\r\nthe likeness which it bore to the beloved mistress whom he had not seen\r\nfor so many years. Afterwards we know Cristoforo moved on to Urbino,\r\nwhere Bembo and Emilia Pia and the good duchess all gave him a glad\r\nwelcome, and Castiglione enshrined his memory in the pages of the\r\n_Cortigiano_. Then, again, we find him in his native city, Rome,\r\nsearching for antiques in the ruins of the Eternal City, and examining\r\nthe newly discovered Laocoon with Michelo Angelo, until at last the\r\nincurable malady which had long undermined his strength put an end to\r\nhis life, and he died in the prime of manhood at the Santa Casa of\r\nLoreto. But his best work was done, and his happiest years were spent,\r\nin the service of Duchess Beatrice, at the court of Milan.\r\n\r\nIf Lodovico did not always care to part from his best artists at\r\nIsabella's request, he rarely failed to oblige his charming\r\nsister-in-law in other matters. Presents of game and venison, choice\r\nvegetables and fruit, artichokes and truffles, apples and pears or\r\npeaches, were constantly borne to Mantua by his couriers; and in return\r\nIsabella would send him the famous salmon-trout of the Lake of Garda,\r\nthat were accounted such rare delicacies, and which Lodovico was fond of\r\nseeing at table, especially, as he often remarked, in Lent. The\r\ncorrespondence between the two courts was briskly kept up that year,\r\nalthough Isabella was unable to visit Milan. Lodovico himself rarely\r\nmissed a post, and complained repeatedly that Isabella was not so\r\nregular a correspondent as himself.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my affection for your Highness is greater than yours for\r\nme,\" he says, writing in September, 1491. \"It is plain that I think of\r\nyou much oftener than you think of me, and I know for certain that I\r\nwrite far more letters to you than you ever write to me.\"\r\n\r\nBut Isabella was unwearied in the applications which she made constantly\r\nto her brother-in-law on behalf of persons who, rightly or wrongly, had\r\nbeen accused of offences against the laws of Milan. Often, it must be\r\nowned, these suppliants whom she recommended to mercy proved to be\r\ncriminals of the worst type; and quite as often the _protégés_ whom she\r\nsent to Milan turned out to be utterly worthless characters. This made\r\nher a little ashamed of the perpetual recommendations with which she\r\ntroubled Lodovico, and explains the apologetic tone of a note which she\r\naddressed to him in June, 1491, on behalf of some suppliant for money.\r\n\r\n\"The letters of recommendation which I have received in this case are so\r\nurgent that I feel it would be brutal to refuse the petition I send you,\r\nespecially since they are addressed to me by private friends. But if\r\nyour Highness complains, as you may justly do, of the frequency of my\r\nappeals, I must ask you to impute their persistency less to me than to\r\nmy innate compassion, which induces me to intercede for all who ask in\r\ngood faith. But the truth is, your Highness has given me so many tokens\r\nof affection that many persons who seek your favour apply to me,\r\ntrusting to my powers of intercession. And since I should be well\r\ncontent to let the whole world know the love and kindness which your\r\nHighness shows me, I grant these requests the more easily, because I\r\nremember what good fruit my recommendations have hitherto borne.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the Marquis Gianfrancesco was away from Mantua, we find\r\nhis wife consulting Lodovico on affairs of state, asking him to prevent\r\nher neighbour Galeotto della Mirandola from constructing a canal which\r\nmay injure her subjects, or appealing to the Sanseverino brothers in the\r\ncase of a faithless servant of hers who had sought shelter under the\r\nCount of Caiazzo's banners. Beatrice, in her turn, occasionally sent her\r\nservants and subjects with recommendations to Mantua. For instance,\r\nthat July a Milanese soldier named Messer Giacomello arrived at the\r\ncourt of the Gonzagas, with letters from the Duchess of Bari and Messer\r\nGaleazzo di Sanseverino, asking for leave to fight a duel with a man of\r\nAscoli who had insulted him; and the marchioness, ignorant of the\r\ncustomary method of treating these challenges, referred the case to her\r\nhusband in a long and elaborate statement.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September Beatrice fell ill, and for some days her\r\nhusband was seriously uneasy about her. The anxiety which he showed, and\r\nthe attentions with which he surrounded her, were duly reported by\r\nGiacomo Trotti in a letter to Ferrara.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Lodovico,\" he wrote on the 18th of September, \"does not leave\r\nhis wife's bedside by day or night. He is always with her, and thinks of\r\nnothing but how he can best please and amuse her. The only cause of\r\nregret he has is that as yet there are not any signs of the birth of a\r\nson and heir.\"\r\n\r\nLodovico's concern for his young wife was genuine. He wrote daily\r\nreports of her health to Isabella and her mother, and on the 4th of\r\nOctober rejoiced to be able to tell the Marchesana that her sister had\r\nonce more been able to assist at a boar-hunt, which had taken place six\r\nmiles from Pavia.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday your sister came to look on at a boar-hunt, six or seven\r\nmiles from here. She drove to the spot in a chariot with a raised seat\r\nat the back, very much like the pulpits from which friars preach! Here\r\nshe stood up, to be out of danger, and enjoyed herself immensely, as\r\nbeing placed at such a height, she could see the whole hunt better than\r\nany one else.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later he wrote again to say he had decided to send his wife\r\nto Genoa, since the air of Pavia was not healthy, he felt convinced, at\r\nthis season of the year, and in the hope that change would help to\r\ncomplete her cure.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow my wife starts for Genoa _incognita_. I am sending her, first\r\nof all, to give her pleasure and do her health good, and, secondly, to\r\nprepare the way for your Highness when you come here next.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have no further particulars of this visit to Genova la\r\nSuperba, that city which both the sisters were so anxious to see, and\r\nthe letters in which Beatrice described this journey to her husband have\r\neither perished or still lie buried in some private archives. All we\r\nknow is that Cristoforo Romano was among the singers who accompanied the\r\nduchess on this occasion, although she travelled _incognita_ and took\r\nonly a few persons in her suite.\r\n\r\nBy December Lodovico and his wife were again settled in Milan, where\r\nthey received an unexpected visit from the Marquis of Mantua in the\r\nfirst week of that month. Gianfrancesco's own wife was absent with her\r\nmother at Ferrara, and without even informing Isabella of his intention,\r\nhe suddenly arrived at Milan, and spent a week at the Castello with the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Bari. As a rule, the company of the marquis, a brave\r\nsoldier, but not apparently a very attractive person, with his short\r\nungainly figure and rugged features, his dark complexion and rough\r\nmanners, was not particularly agreeable to his polished brother-in-law;\r\nbut he received a kindly welcome from both his hosts on this occasion,\r\nand was highly gratified with the honours and attention that were paid\r\nhim. Isabella, on her part, was overjoyed to hear of the kindness with\r\nwhich her husband had been treated at the court of Milan, and declared\r\nthat his letters gave her as much pleasure as if she had been with him\r\nherself. Lodovico did his guest the honours of his palace and city,\r\nshowed him the treasures and jewels of the Castello, and sent him home\r\nloaded with gifts. Among other presents which Gianfrancesco received\r\nfrom his brother-in-law were a pair of lions which the Moro, who was\r\nconstantly sending to Africa for wild beasts, showed him in his\r\nmenagerie, and promised to send him as soon as they were sufficiently\r\ntame. Some weeks, however, passed before they were pronounced fit to\r\ntravel safely, and it was not till February of the following year that\r\nthey were sent to Mantua, with a note from Lodovico, explaining that the\r\nkeeper who accompanied them was accustomed to wild beasts, and would\r\nteach Gianfrancesco's servants how to treat them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 111.\r\n\r\n[16] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 114.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nClaims of Charles VIII. to Naples--Of the Duke of Orleans to Milan--\r\nIntrigues of the Venetian Senate, of Pope Innocent VIII., and of\r\nFerrante and Alfonso of Naples--Visit of the French ambassadors to Milan\r\n--Treasures of the Castello--Jewels of Lodovico Sforza--Isabella of\r\nAragon and her father--An embassy to the French court proposed--Secret\r\ninstructions of the Count of Caiazzo--_Fête_ at Vigevano--Tournament of\r\nPavia.\r\n\r\n1491\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important event at the court of Milan that winter was the visit\r\nof the French ambassadors. The young King of France, Charles VIII., now\r\nthat he had emancipated himself from his sister's tutelage and felt\r\nhimself his own master, was beginning to cherish secret dreams of\r\nconquest, and already turned envious eyes towards the kingdom of Naples,\r\nthat ancient heritage of the House of Anjou. His own ardour for military\r\nglory was fanned by the presence at the French court of several exiled\r\nnoblemen, who had fled from Naples to escape the harsh rule of King\r\nFerrante and his hated son Alfonso, and were burning to avenge their\r\nwrongs. Chief among these were Antonio, Prince of Salerno, the head of\r\nthe great Sanseverino family, and his cousin, the Prince of Bisignano,\r\nboth of whom were in constant communication with their kinsmen at the\r\nMilanese court. At the same time, Charles VIII.'s brother-in-law and\r\ncousin, Louis, Duke of Orleans, a valiant and ambitious prince just\r\nthirty years of age, who had inherited the Lombard town of Asti from his\r\ngrandmother, Valentina Visconti, and claimed the Duchy of Milan in right\r\nof his descent from the Visconti dukes, rejoiced at the prospect of\r\nadvancing his pretensions against the rival House of Sforza.\r\n\r\nAlready more than one invitation to cross the Alps had reached the\r\nyoung French king from Italy. In January, 1484, when Venice was waging a\r\ndesperate war against Milan and Naples, Antonio Loredano was sent to the\r\nFrench court with secret instructions to remind Charles VIII., who had\r\njust succeeded his father, Louis XI., that the kingdom of Naples had\r\nformerly belonged to his family, and that, besides occupying a throne to\r\nwhich he had no right, Ferrante of Aragon had instigated Lodovico Sforza\r\nto usurp the crown of Milan. The Venetian envoy was further desired to\r\ninform the Duke of Orleans that Lodovico evidently intended to make\r\nhimself Duke of Milan in his nephew's stead, and to point out that Louis\r\ncould not find a better moment than this, to assert his own claim to the\r\nduchy of his Visconti ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"Say all you can to instigate the Duke of Orleans to undertake this\r\nenterprise,\" were the secret instructions of the Ten, \"and tell the\r\nFrench that if they wish to dethrone the tyrant Ferrante and seize\r\nNaples, they will never have a better opportunity.\"[17]\r\n\r\nA month later the Venetian Government sent another message to Louis of\r\nOrleans, urging him to invade Milan, and offering him the help of their\r\nforces. The duke was by no means averse to the suggestion, but Anne de\r\nBeaujeu, who governed France during her brother's minority, wisely\r\ndeclined to meddle in the quarrels of Italian States, and by August\r\npeace had been concluded between Venice and Milan.\r\n\r\nFive years afterwards Pope Innocent VIII., having quarrelled with King\r\nFerrante, invited Charles VIII. to invade Naples, and offered him the\r\ninvestiture of this important fief of the Church. But at that time the\r\nFrench monarch had no leisure to think of a foreign expedition. He was\r\nalready engaged in war with Maximilian, King of the Romans, and in a\r\nfierce quarrel with the States of Brittany over the regency of that\r\nprovince during the minority of young Duchess Anne, the betrothed bride\r\nof the future Emperor, whose first wife, Mary of Burgundy, had died in\r\n1482. Finding that there was no prospect of help from this quarter, the\r\nPope had been forced to come to terms with Ferrante, whose armies\r\nthreatened Rome, and made peace with Naples in January, 1492.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles VIII. had mortally offended the King of the Romans by\r\nsending back his daughter Margaret, to whom while yet Dauphin he had\r\nbeen formally betrothed by his father, Louis XI., and who had been\r\neducated in Touraine for the last six years, and taking Maximilian's\r\naffianced bride, Anne of Brittany, for his wife. The marriage was\r\nsolemnized in the Castle of Langeais in December, 1491, and two months\r\nafterwards the new queen was crowned at Saint Denis. Maximilian now\r\nsought to form a coalition against Charles, to avenge his injured\r\nhonour; and his ally, Henry VII. of England, sent a letter to Lodovico\r\nSforza, asking him to join the league and invade France from the south.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Charles VIII. was naturally anxious to\r\nstrengthen the old alliance which had existed between his father and the\r\nHouse of Sforza. Even before his own marriage, in the summer of 1490,\r\nLodovico had sent Erasmo Brasca on a private mission to the French king,\r\nto ask for a renewal of the investiture of the Duchy of Genoa,\r\noriginally granted to Francesco Sforza by Louis XI. Since those days,\r\nGenoa had been lost during the regency of Duchess Bona, and only\r\nrecovered in 1888, by Lodovico's successful negotiations. Now Charles\r\nVIII. gladly granted the regent's request, and proposed to send an\r\nembassy to Milan in the course of the next year. Lodovico, on his part,\r\nprepared to give the French ambassadors a splendid reception, and in\r\nMarch, 1491, wrote to his chief secretary, Bartolommeo Calco, from\r\nVigevano, giving minute instructions for the preparation of a suite of\r\nrooms in the Castello, where the Most Christian King's envoys were to be\r\nlodged. Since, at that time, extensive improvements were being made in\r\nother parts of the palace, Lodovico gave up his own rooms on the ground\r\nfloor for the use of these distinguished strangers. The chief\r\nambassador, the Scottish noble, Bernard Stuart d'Aubigny, Chamberlain to\r\nKing Charles, he wrote word, would occupy the Duchess of Bari's\r\napartment, known as the Sala della Asse, from the raised platform at one\r\nend of the room, and would use the duchess's boudoir, with the painted\r\nAmorini over the mantelpiece, and the adjoining chambers for his dining\r\nand robing room. The second ambassador, Jean Roux de Visque, was to\r\noccupy Lodovico's apartments; and the third, King Charles's doctor, the\r\nItalian Teodoro Guainiero of Pavia, would be lodged in the rooms of\r\nMadonna Beatrice, Niccolo da Correggio's mother, and of the duke's\r\nsecretary, Jacopo Antiquario. All of these rooms had been decorated and\r\nhung with rich tapestries and curtains of velvet and brocade for\r\nLodovico's wedding a year before, but on this occasion he desired that\r\ncanopies adorned with the _fleur-de-lys_ should be placed over the beds,\r\nand that other changes should be made in the hangings and furniture. And\r\nsince there was not room in the Castello, where the court officials and\r\nservants who were daily lodged and fed within its precincts already\r\nnumbered some two hundred, for the whole of the suite, the remainder\r\nwere to be entertained at the duke's expense at the different inns of\r\nthe city, at the sign of the Stella, the Fontana and Campana.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the ambassadors arrived at Milan, and were\r\nmagnificently received by Lodovico and his nephew, both of whom wore\r\nsumptuous vests of white Lyons brocade, presented to them in the French\r\nking's name, at the ceremony of investiture which followed. Giangaleazzo\r\nwas formally invested with the Duchy of Genoa, and did homage to the\r\nrepresentative of his suzerain, the French king, in the presence of the\r\nwhole court. Among the members of the ducal family present on this\r\noccasion was the duke's elder sister, Bianca Maria, who still remained\r\nunmarried since her affianced husband, the son of Matthias Corvinus, had\r\nbeen driven from the throne of Hungary, after his father's death in\r\n1490. The splendour of the ceremony, and the dazzling white velvet suits\r\nworn by her brother and uncle, were long remembered by this princess of\r\nseventeen, who spent most of her time with her mother, Bona, at\r\nAbbiategrasso. More than seven years afterwards, when poor Giangaleazzo\r\nwas dead, and the Sforzas' throne was already tottering to its fall,\r\nBianca Maria, then the wife of the Emperor Maximilian, wrote from\r\nFribourg, begging her uncle to try and procure her a robe of the white\r\nvelvet woven at Lyons, \"like the vests worn by yourself and my brother,\r\nof blessed memory, on the day when he was invested with the Duchy of\r\nGenoa.\"[18] The young empress, whose mind, as her husband complained,\r\nnever rose above childish things, and who, in the lonely splendour of\r\nher grim castles in the Tyrol, pined for the brightness of her fair\r\nMilanese home, had set her heart on a gown of this material, and begged\r\nher kind uncle to excuse her if she asked too much, assuring him that\r\nnothing else could give her so much pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Milan, with its stately Castello and white marble Duomo,\r\nits spacious streets and long rows of armourers' and goldsmiths' shops,\r\nits beautiful gardens and frescoed palaces, made a deep impression upon\r\nthese strangers from the North. Never had they seen so fair a city or so\r\nrich a land. Marvellous were the tales they had to tell their countrymen\r\nof the splendid court where they had lived like princes, and of this\r\nwealthy and magnificent Signor Lodovico, who had entertained them in so\r\nroyal a manner.\r\n\r\nBut although the investiture of Genoa had been provisionally granted,\r\nand a treaty of alliance agreed upon, several articles of the league\r\nstill remained to be discussed. Negotiations dragged on all through the\r\nyear, chiefly with regard to certain castles belonging to Charles's\r\nally, the Marquis of Montferrat, which had been seized by the Milanese.\r\nNiccolo da Correggio was sent to France in the summer to endeavour to\r\nbring matters to a satisfactory conclusion, but nothing was finally\r\nsettled until the winter, when Charles decided to send a second embassy\r\nto Milan. This time one of the former envoys, Jean Roux de Visque, was\r\nselected for the office, and, together with Le Sieur Pierre de\r\nCourthardi, left Paris early in December, and arrived at Milan in\r\nJanuary, 1492.\r\n\r\nLodovico himself received the ambassadors in the Castello, and\r\nentertained them with his wonted magnificence. A treaty was drawn up, by\r\nwhich Charles agreed to recognize all the claims advanced by the Duke of\r\nMilan, and admitted the Duke of Bari by name as governor of his nephew\r\ninto the defensive and offensive league concluded on the 13th of\r\nJanuary, and on the 19th the French ambassadors left Milan. Before their\r\ndeparture, however, Lodovico, anxious to do his guests honour and at the\r\nsame time impress them with his wealth and the vast resources at his\r\ncommand, himself conducted them over the Treasury of the Castello,\r\nwhich was deservedly regarded as one of the principal sights of Milan.\r\n\r\nThere, in the heart of the Rocchetta, close to his own apartments, was\r\nthe vaulted room, decorated with frescoes by Leonardo and Bramante, and\r\nknown as the Sala del Tesoro. Here, piled up in enormous chests, were\r\nthe vast store of gold ducats which he kept as a reserve fund for the\r\nState, and the priceless jewels that were his own private property.\r\nHere, too, in oak presses, secured by ingenious contrivances devised\r\nexpressly for the purpose by Leonardo, were the treasures of gold and\r\nsilver plate, the salvers and goblets, the dishes and vases of antique\r\nshape, in which the Moro took especial pride, and which were only\r\nexhibited on festive occasions. Milan was at this time one of the\r\nrichest states in Italy. The revenue of the duchy, under Lodovico's wise\r\nand careful rule, exceeded the sum of 600,000 ducats--that is to say,\r\ndouble the revenue of Naples, and more than six times as much as that of\r\nMantua, and was only surpassed by that of Venice, which amounted to\r\n800,000 ducats; while, according to the same table, the revenue of\r\nEngland in the fifteenth century was calculated at 700,000 ducats, and\r\nthat of France at 1,000,000 ducats. And here, too, in the Sala del\r\nTesoro, were the jewels belonging to Lodovico, a collection which at\r\nthis time included some of the most famous gems in the world. A few of\r\nthese which he pawned to a Venetian merchant in 1495, were valued at\r\n150,000 ducats, and a list, which is still preserved in the Trivulzio\r\nlibrary, gives a description of the different jewels which in the\r\ntroubled times at the close of his reign were pledged to bankers in Rome\r\nand Milan.[19] There was the balass ruby, called _El Spigo_ or \"the ear\r\nof corn,\" which was valued at the enormous sum of 250,000 ducats; and\r\nthe jewel of _Il Lupo_, \"the wolf,\" consisting of one large diamond and\r\nthree choice pearls, which the goldsmiths priced at 120,000 ducats.\r\nThere was the famous _Puncta_, or diamond arrow, given by Duchess\r\nBeatrice's grandfather, Niccolo d'Este, to Francesco Sforza; and the\r\n_Caduceus_, a favourite device of the Moro's, wrought in large pearls,\r\neach of which was said to be worth 25,000 ducats; while the balass ruby,\r\nknown as the Marone, often worn as a brooch by Beatrice, was valued at\r\n10,000 ducats. Another balass bore the effigy of Lodovico, and the\r\ninsignia of the Moraglia, or Mulberry, was composed of emeralds,\r\ndiamonds, and pearls. This jewel was frequently worn by the Moro\r\nhimself, at state banquets, as well as the famous Sancy diamond, which\r\nhad been found on the body of Charles the Bold after the battle of\r\nNancy, and afterwards acquired by Lodovico, whose agents were always in\r\nsearch of precious stones of fine water and rare workmanship.\r\n\r\nSuch were a few of the treasures which the regent displayed before the\r\ndazzled eyes of the French ambassadors. Unfortunately the presents which\r\nhe gave them on their departure seemed to them poor and insignificant,\r\nafter the marvels which they had seen in the Castello, and their\r\ncupidity was but ill-satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"The French envoys,\" wrote the Florentine ambassador, Pandolfini, to his\r\nmaster, Lorenzo de Medici, \"are gone away disappointed with Signor\r\nLodovico's gifts, expecting to receive a handsomer present after seeing\r\nall the splendours of the Treasury.\"[20]\r\n\r\nLodovico now determined to send an embassy to the French court to return\r\nthe king's civilities and congratulate him on his marriage. He was the\r\nmore anxious to strengthen his alliance with France on account of the\r\ngrowing estrangement between himself and the royal family of Naples.\r\nHitherto, indeed, King Ferrante had maintained cordial relations with\r\nthe Regent of Milan, whose claims to this position he had been the first\r\nto support, and whose marriage with his granddaughter Beatrice formed a\r\nnew link between the Houses of Aragon and Sforza. But his son Alfonso,\r\nDuke of Calabria, who had frequently visited Milan during the long war\r\nwith Venice, had never forgiven Lodovico for treating with the Venetians\r\nindependently, and made no secret of his hatred for his brother-in-law.\r\nThe quarrel between the two princes was naturally embittered by the\r\ncomplaints which Alfonso received from his daughter Isabella, Duchess of\r\nMilan. Her miserable husband, Giangaleazzo, showed less inclination than\r\never to take his proper place at the head of affairs, and abandoned\r\nhimself to low debauchery. In his drunken fits it was even said that he\r\nforgot himself so far as to strike his wife.\r\n\r\n\"There is no news here,\" wrote the widowed Marchioness of Montferrat\r\nfrom Milan to her envoy at Mantua, on the 2nd of May, 1492, \"saving that\r\nthe Duke of Milan has beaten his wife.\"[21]\r\n\r\nBut the proud and high-spirited duchess began to resent the subordinate\r\nposition in which she and her husband were placed at their own court,\r\nand she tried to instil her keen sense of this injustice into\r\nGiangaleazzo's feeble mind. When Lodovico came to Pavia that spring, his\r\nnephew began by refusing to see him, but before long he forgot his\r\nwrongs, and after behaving for a few days like a sulky child, was on the\r\nmost affectionate terms with his uncle when they met again. Isabella\r\nsoon found that no dependence could be placed upon this foolish youth,\r\nwho cared for nothing but his dogs and horses, and repeated everything\r\nthat she said to Lodovico. So she devoured her griefs in silence, and\r\nonly gave utterance to her sorrows in her letters to Naples.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alfonso did his utmost to stir up enemies against Lodovico,\r\nwhile, with habitual duplicity, he sent flattering messages to his\r\nbrother-in-law, and begged for the continuance of his friendship. That\r\nFebruary envoys were sent from Naples to France, under pretence of\r\nbuying horses and dogs for hunting, but with secret instructions to\r\npersuade Charles VIII., if possible, to break with Lodovico Sforza, and\r\nrefuse to acknowledge him as Regent of Milan. Charles, however, was too\r\nmuch intent on his own plans for the conquest of Naples to pay any heed\r\nto these proposals, and the only result of Alfonso's intrigues was to\r\nstrengthen the alliance between France and Milan.\r\n\r\nGianfrancesco, Count of Caiazzo, the eldest of the Sanseverino brothers,\r\nwas chosen by Lodovico as chief ambassador to the French king, and\r\nreceived secret instructions to show Charles VIII. the proposals which\r\nhad been made to the Regent of Milan by the King of England and\r\nMaximilian, King of the Romans.\r\n\r\n\"Let him know by this means,\" runs the letter, still preserved in the\r\nMilanese archives, \"how unwilling we are to act in any way against his\r\ninterests, and let him see that we have preferred his alliance to that\r\nof the mightiest monarchs in Europe. Take care also to insist on the\r\nimportance of the Duchy of Milan and on the exalted position that we\r\noccupy in the eyes of other Italian States. And assure him that we are\r\nhis firm and loyal friends, whose constancy neither threats nor promises\r\ncan ever shake.\"[22]\r\n\r\nCount Carlo Belgiojoso, Galeazzo Visconti and Girolamo Tuttavilla, Count\r\nof Sarno, who was himself one of King Ferrante's exiled subjects, were\r\nselected to accompany Caiazzo on his mission. On the 23rd of February\r\nthey left Milan, and reached Paris towards the end of March.\r\n\r\nNot only had Lodovico given his envoys minute instructions as to the\r\nlanguage they were to hold in treating with the French king, but the\r\nclothes they were to wear, the presents which they bore to Charles VIII.\r\nand his queen, the very day and hour of their entry into Paris, were all\r\nregulated by his orders. His astrologer, Ambrogio di Rosate, had fixed\r\nupon the 28th of March as the most propitious moment for Caiazzo to\r\nenter Paris, and on that day, accordingly, the Milanese ambassadors,\r\nsplendidly arrayed in rich brocades and cloth of gold, rode through the\r\nstreets of the capital, and under the walls of the old Louvre, where the\r\nking and queen had their abode. On the following day, Charles himself\r\nreceived the envoys, and Galeazzo Visconti delivered a long Latin\r\ndiscourse prepared by Lodovico. On the 30th they were presented to the\r\nqueen, and a few days afterwards they accompanied the royal party on a\r\nhunting expedition in the forest of Saint-Germain, but found the sport\r\nof a rude and fatiguing description, and complained that both men and\r\nanimals were very savage in their habits. Every detail of the\r\nproceedings was faithfully reported to Lodovico by Antonio Calco, the\r\nsecretary of the mission. For his benefit and that of Beatrice, he not\r\nonly describes the costumes of the royal pair--the king's gorgeous\r\nmantle of Lyons velvet, lined with yellow satin, and the queen's gold\r\nbrocade robe and cape of lion skin lined with crimson--but gives a\r\nminute account of Anne of Brittany's coiffure, a black velvet cap with\r\na gold fringe hanging about a finger's length over her forehead, and a\r\nhood studded with big diamonds drawn over her head and ears. So curious\r\nwere Beatrice and her ladies on these matters, that Lodovico wrote on\r\nthe 8th of April from Vigevano, desiring Calco to send him a drawing of\r\nthe French queen's costume, \"in order that the same fashion may be\r\nadopted here in Milan.\" At the same time Lodovico desired Caiazzo to\r\nshow especial civility to the Duke of Orleans, assuring him that the\r\nDukes of Bari and Milan both regarded him as their own kinsman, and\r\nhoped that the love and friendship between them would be that of\r\nbrothers. The ambassador was further empowered to offer the hand of\r\nBianca Sforza, the duke's unmarried sister, to James IV., the young King\r\nof Scotland, through Stuart d'Aubigny, the Scottish nobleman whom\r\nCharles VIII. had sent as his envoy to Milan. Meanwhile, King Ferrante's\r\nemissaries were doing their best to stir up the Duke of Orleans against\r\nhis Sforza rivals, and had secretly offered his granddaughter Charlotte\r\nin marriage to the youthful Scottish monarch.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment Lodovico's star was in the ascendant, and his\r\ninfluence reigned supreme at the French court. Charles VIII. formally\r\nratified all the conditions of the treaty which had been signed at Milan\r\nin January, and wrote to inform Pope Innocent that he had entered into\r\nclose alliance with the house of Sforza, and would regard any injury\r\ndone to the Dukes of Milan and Bari as a personal wrong.\r\n\r\nThe object of the embassy being accomplished, Count Caiazzo, Galeazzo\r\nVisconti and Tuttavilla took leave of the French king and returned to\r\nMilan on the 5th of May, leaving Count Belgiojoso as permanent envoy at\r\nParis. The triumph of Lodovico's diplomacy was complete, and without\r\nshedding a drop of blood, or making any warlike demonstration, he had\r\noutwitted all his foes and secured the alliance of his most powerful\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nThe good news gave fresh zest to the pleasures of Beatrice's court that\r\nsummer, and to all the memorable enterprises upon which Lodovico was\r\nengaged at home.\r\n\r\nEarly in March the Duke and Duchess of Bari left Milan to take up their\r\nabode at Vigevano, and held a series of brilliant _fêtes_ and hunting\r\nparties in this newly-finished palace. The works upon which Bramante and\r\nhis companions had been employed for years past were finished, the great\r\nhall with its richly-wrought marble capitals, the noble tower and\r\nimposing porticoes, were all complete. The last stone was in its place,\r\nand on the great archway that formed the entrance to the stately pile,\r\nLodovico placed this proud Latin inscription, bearing the date, 1492.\r\n\r\n     \"LUDOVICUS MARIA SFORTIA VICECOMES PRINCIPATU JOANNI GALEACIO\r\n     NEPOTI AB EXTERIS ET INTESTINIS MOTIBUS STABILITO POSTEAQUAM\r\n     SQUALLENTES AGROS VIGEVANENSES IMMISSIS FLUMINIBUS FERTILES\r\n     FECIT AD VOLUPTARIOS SECESSUS IN HAC ARCE VETERES PRINCIPUM\r\n     EDES REFORMAVIT ET NOVIS CIRCUMEDIFICATIS SPECIOSA, ETIAM\r\n     TURRI MUNIVIT POPULI QUOQUE HABITATIONIS SITU ET SQUALORE\r\n     OCCUPATAS STRATIS UT EXPEDITIS PER URBEM VIIS AD CIVILEM\r\n     LAUTICIAM REDEGIT DIRRUTIS ETIAM CIRCA FORUM VETERIBUS\r\n     EDIFICIIS ARCAM AMPLIANT AC PORTICIBUS CIRCUMDUCTIS IN HANC\r\n     SPECIEM EXORNAVIT. ANNO A SALUTE CHRISTIANA NONAGESIMOSECUNDO\r\n     SUPRA MILLESIMUM ET QUADRIGENTESIMUM.\"\r\n\r\nHe had given back peace to his nephew's realm and had vanquished external\r\nfoes and quelled internal dissensions, he had brought rivers of water to\r\nmake the barren fields of Vigevano fertile, and had rebuilt the ancient\r\nForum and raised fair porticoes and fine houses round the wide square.\r\nAnd now, as a crowning gift to this his native city, he had restored and\r\nbeautified the ancestral castle of the illustrious house of Sforza and\r\nhad reared stately halls and a fair tower to make Vigevano a home of\r\nperpetual delight.\r\n\r\nDuring the continual round of amusements in which these festive weeks\r\nwere spent, Beatrice had little time for writing, and the only letter we\r\nhave from her hand during this visit to Vigevano is one addressed to her\r\nsister Isabella, in which she begs for information respecting Father\r\nBernardino da Feltre, a famous revivalist preacher of the Franciscan\r\norder, who had travelled through the cities of Central Italy, preaching\r\nrepentance and founding the charitable institutions known as Monte di\r\nPietà for the relief of the poor.\r\n\r\n\"A report has reached us here,\" wrote the young duchess, \"that the\r\nvenerable Father Bernardino da Feltre, who has been preaching in Verona\r\nthis Lent, was heard to declare from the pulpit that he had received a\r\nmessage from heaven, warning him that he would die in Holy Week, after\r\nmiraculously opening the eyes of a blind man. Now I am very anxious to\r\nknow if this report is true, and since at Mantua you are sufficiently\r\nnear Verona to learn the truth of these tales, I beg you to make\r\ninquiries and let me know the result.\"\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, Isabella, who had been absent from Mantua, was able\r\nto satisfy her sister's curiosity and at the same time answer a previous\r\nnote in which Beatrice had given her a bad character of one of the\r\nMarchesana's _protégés_, an archer in Fracassa's service. She writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND HONOURED SISTER,\r\n\r\n\"Only yesterday I received two letters which you wrote to me on the 16th\r\nand 17th of April: the one in answer to my recommendation of Malacarno,\r\nSignor Fracassa's archer, the other regarding a report which had reached\r\nyou as to certain words which Fra Bernardino da Feltre is said to have\r\nspoken at Verona. In reply to your first letter, I assure your Highness\r\nthat if I had ever dreamt Malacarno could be guilty of such detestable\r\ncrimes, I would never have pleaded his cause, since naturally I hate\r\nsuch conduct. But as I had been told his faults were trifling, I\r\nconsented to intercede with you on his behalf; and now I hear the bad\r\ncharacter he bears, am well satisfied to hear the punishment which he\r\nhas received, and praise your illustrious consort's prudence, while at\r\nthe same time I thank you for the very kind expressions in your letter.\r\nAs to Fra Bernardino's supposed prophecy that he would die this Holy\r\nWeek after miraculously opening the eyes of a blind man, I find that\r\nthere is absolutely no truth in the report you mention. Neither at\r\nVerona, nor yet at Padua, where he has also been preaching, did he ever\r\nuse such language, which indeed his humility would forbid, and as I have\r\nlearnt from a monk who attended his sermons. All the same, in order to\r\nsatisfy you and make sure of the truth, I have made further inquiries,\r\nthe result of which I now lay before you, begging you to commend me\r\nwarmly to your illustrious lord.[23]\r\n\r\n\"Mantua, May 2nd, 1492.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Vigevano, Lodovico and his wife moved to Pavia, where the summer\r\nmonths were spent in entertaining a succession of guests, and, as\r\nbefore, Beatrice and Isabella joined together in hunting parties and\r\namusements of every description. Giangaleazzo had totally forgotten his\r\npassing vexation, the clouds which darkened Isabella's sad life seemed\r\nto lift for the moment, and once more harmony reigned in the ducal\r\nfamily. The _fêtes_ in honour of her son's christening, which had been\r\npostponed in the previous summer, were now celebrated with increased\r\nsplendour. Bramante was summoned to arrange a succession of dramatic\r\nperformances, and a grand tournament was held in the park of the\r\nCastello, in which Messer Galeazzo and his brother and all the most\r\nskilled jousters at court took part. And the Moro's accomplished friend,\r\nErmolao Barbaro, the young Venetian patriarch, who had been once more\r\nsent as envoy to Milan, composed a wonderful Latin epigram in honour of\r\nthe occasion, praying Pallas not to avert her face in sorrow at the\r\nsound and tumult of war, which is after all but a mimic display, and\r\ncalling upon her, the goddess whose wisdom Lodovico honours above all\r\nthe thunders of Jove, to bless the great house of Sforza, illustrious\r\nalike in the arts of war and peace.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] Secret Archives of the Venetian Senate, Reg. 31, fol. 123, 131,\r\netc., and Reg. 32, fol. 87.\r\n\r\n[18] F.

The intellectual and\r\nartistic movement which Lodovico Sforza had inaugurated was now in full\r\nvigour, and the fruits of his wise and enlightened rule began to appear\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\n\"Now that the wars were ended,\" writes Corio, \"an era of peace and\r\nprosperity began, and everything seemed on a firmer and more stable\r\nfoundation than it had ever been in times past. The court of our princes\r\nwas most splendid, full of new fashions, rich clothes, and endless\r\ndelights. Here Minerva and Venus vied with each other, while beautiful\r\nyouths and maidens came to learn in the school of Cupid, Minerva held\r\nher gentle academy in Milan, and that illustrious prince, Lodovico\r\nSforza, brought men of rare excellence from the furthest ends of Europe\r\nat his expense. Here the learning of Greece shone, together with the\r\nprose and verse of the Latin race. Here the muses of poetry, and the\r\nmasters of sculpture reigned supreme; here came the most distinguished\r\npainters from distant regions; here night and day were heard sounds of\r\nsuch sweet singing, and such delicious harmonies of music, that they\r\nseemed to descend from heaven itself.\"\r\n\r\nForemost among the \"men of singular merit\" whom Lodovico attracted to\r\nhis court and retained in his service, were his two secretaries,\r\nBartolommeo Calco and Jacopo Antiquario of Perugia. Both were men of\r\ngreat learning and discernment, fired with the same passion for arts and\r\nletters as their master, and as liberal as he was in assisting poorer\r\nscholars. Calco was Lodovico's right hand and chief adviser in his great\r\nschemes for beautifying cities and palaces. He delivered his orders to\r\nthe countless artists in his employment, arranged court festivities and\r\ngenerally conducted the duke's correspondence. Jacopo Antiquario was\r\nmore purely a scholar, who protected other men of letters, and helped\r\nthem generously in time of need. His honest nature and kindly actions\r\nmade him singularly beloved, and a contemporary describes him as the\r\nmost learned of good men, and the best of learned men; while his\r\nintimate friend, the great printer, Aldo Manuzio, has immortalized his\r\nmemory in the beautiful epistle in which he dedicates the Moralia of\r\nPlutarch to this man, whose name, he prays, may go down to future ages\r\nlinked with his own. Both of these secretaries proved able assistants in\r\nthe great revival of art and learning which is Lodovico's lasting title\r\nto fame. Chief among these was the reform and extension of the\r\nUniversity of Pavia. During the troubled times that followed Galeazzo\r\nSforza's death, this ancient University had sunk to a very low ebb. The\r\nprofessors remained unpaid, and in many cases ceased to lecture, the\r\nbuildings were small and inconvenient and the students lawless and\r\nriotous. Lodovico set himself with a stern hand to repress abuses on the\r\none side, while on the other he grudged neither time nor money in\r\npromoting the cause of learning. A letter which he addressed to the\r\nstudents from Vigevano in August, 1488, only a few weeks before the\r\ndangerous illness which almost ended his life, deserves to be quoted, if\r\nonly as an example of the attention which he gave to every detail of\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\"Not a day passes,\" he writes, \"but I hear of some fresh misconduct on\r\nyour part, some crime committed or some uproar excited in the city, by\r\nyou who are scholars of the University. Even last Holy Week your\r\nbehaviour towards certain gentlemen and citizens of Pavia was justly the\r\ncause of scandal and complaint. Such things are not to be borne, nor do\r\nI intend to bear them any longer. Schools are intended for learning, and\r\nthe object of all study and learning is that we may know how to live\r\nwell, and, by our good conduct and fair lives, gain honour and praise\r\nboth in the eyes of God and man. We do not see that the human and divine\r\nlaws, in which you are daily instructed, produce any good effect if you\r\ncan behave as you have done in this case towards peaceable citizens,\r\nespecially in these holy days when the fear of God should, above all,\r\ncontrol your ways and actions. If you thus neglect the laws of good\r\nliving, nothing but confusion can be the result. And know that, unless\r\nyou speedily return to better ways, and show more respect for our holy\r\nreligion, and more honourable treatment of our honest citizens, no love\r\nof learning will induce me to countenance such misconduct. For to\r\nrepress crime, keep Italy in peace, and maintain the honour of our\r\nillustrious lord duke, is the first and chief object of our endeavours.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lodovico neglected no means of improving the condition of\r\nboth professors and scholars of the University. In 1489, the magnificent\r\nnew Ateneo which he had planned was completed, and the different schools\r\nof medicine, jurisprudence, fine arts and letters, were brought together\r\nunder the same roof. The most distinguished foreign scholars were\r\ninvited to occupy the different professional chairs, their salaries were\r\nraised and their numbers increased. Giasone del Maino, who was professor\r\nof law at Pavia for fifty-two years, and whose reputation as jurist\r\nattracted students from all parts of the world, received the large\r\nsalary of 2250 florins at this time, while Giorgio Merula of Alessandria,\r\nthe historian, who for many years was professor of rhetoric at the\r\nUniversity, and received only 375 florins in 1486, had his salary\r\nraised in 1492 to 1000 florins. Next to the law schools, that of\r\nmedicine was the most noted for its excellence at Pavia, and among its\r\ndistinguished professors were Alvise Marliani, who was said to rival\r\nAristotle in philosophy, Hippocrates in medicine, and Ptolemy in\r\nastronomy, and who was court-physician in turn to Lodovico Sforza, to\r\nhis son Maximilian, and to the Emperor Charles V.; and Ambrogio of\r\nVarese, who occupied the chair of astrology, and taught the science of\r\nAlmansor, as it was termed. This favourite servant of the Moro received\r\nthe title of Count and the castle and lands of Rosate from Gian Galeazzo\r\nin 1493, \"for his services,\" so ran the patent, \"in saving my illustrious\r\nuncle the Duke of Bari's life.\" Oriental study was another branch of\r\nlearning that Lodovico especially encouraged. Count Teseo de'Albonesi of\r\nPavia became noted as the first Chaldaic scholar of his age, and in 1490,\r\nthe Moro established a chair of Hebrew, and appointed the Jew Benedetto\r\nIspano to be the first professor, with express injunctions to study the\r\ntext of the Bible. This experiment, however, proved a failure, and so few\r\nscholars attended his lectures that at the end of a year the chair was\r\nabolished. At the same time, new colleges were opened, and scholarships\r\nfounded for poor students; and in 1496, Lodovico being then reigning Duke\r\nof Milan, granted the professors of law, medicine, philosophy and fine\r\narts, an exemption from all taxation. Under his fostering care the\r\nUniversity flourished as it had never flourished before. Scholars from\r\nall parts of Europe came to attend Giasone di Maino's lectures, the\r\nnumber of professors reached ninety: that of students was said to be\r\nthree thousand. As the Milanese poet Lancinus Curtius sang in his Latin\r\nrhymes, \"The fair-skinned Germans with their long hair flowing on their\r\nnecks, the English and the knights from Gaul, the Iberian from the golden\r\nsands of Tagus, all hasten thither from the far North. The rude Pannonian\r\nlays aside his military cloak to join the eager throng who crowd into the\r\nvirgin temple and seek the Helicon of Phoebus under the carved dome of\r\nwisdom, which bears Lodovico's name above the stars.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Moro patronage of learning was by no means limited to Pavia. He\r\ndid his utmost to revive the ancient University of Milan, which had long\r\nfallen into decay, and founded new and flourishing schools in this city.\r\nThe best Pavian professors Merula and the Greek Demetrius Calcondila\r\namongst others, were invited to lecture to the Milanese students. Fra\r\nLuca Pacioli of Borgo San Sepolcro, the famous mathematician, came to\r\nteach them geometry and arithmetic, and Ferrari occupied the first chair\r\nof history ever founded in Italy, while the priest Gaffuri became the\r\nfirst public instructor in the new school of music. In short, as a\r\ncontemporary writes, there was not a science of any description that\r\ncould not be learnt at Milan in the days of Lodovico Sforza.\r\n\r\nThe endowment of research was another point in which Lodovico showed\r\nhimself to be in advance of his age. He granted liberal pensions to\r\nBernardino Corio and Tristano Calco, \"the Milanese Livy,\" who continued\r\nthe history of the Visconti begun by the Alessandria professor and\r\naddressed letters in his own hand to the private owners of valuable\r\nmanuscripts, requesting the loan of works that would assist these\r\nwriters of Lombard history, \"in order that a perpetual memory of the\r\ngreat deeds done by our ancestors may be preserved for future\r\ngenerations.\" From his earliest years history had been one of Lodovico's\r\nfavourite studies, and an illuminated volume of extracts from Greek and\r\nRoman history which he compiled under his tutor Filelfo's direction at\r\nthe age of fifteen may still be seen in the library of Turin. And in\r\nriper years, amid all the pressure of State affairs and political\r\nanxieties, he never let a day pass without having some passages from\r\nancient and modern history read aloud to him by his secretaries. So wise\r\nand enlightened a prince well deserved the high praise bestowed upon him\r\nby the Bolognese scholar, Filippo Beroaldo, and the great Florentine,\r\nAngelo Poliziano, with whom Lodovico frequently exchanged letters, and\r\nwho in one of his effusions thus addresses his princely friend: \"All the\r\nworld knows you to be a prince of brilliant genius and singular wisdom,\r\nwhile above all others you cherish the noble arts and show your love for\r\nthese intellectual studies which we profess.\" The jealousy of his own\r\nsubjects was often roused by the favour with which Lodovico regarded\r\nscholars of other nationalities, and on one occasion a fierce quarrel\r\narose between Merula and Poliziano, in which the Lombard historian\r\nstooped to the vilest personalities. Another Pavian professor with whom\r\nhe had a controversy over certain commentaries of Martial, had, it\r\nappears, ventured to hint that Merula did not really know Greek, an\r\ninsinuation which provoked the most violent display of anger on his\r\npart, and when Poliziano endeavoured to appease both parties, the\r\naffronted Lombard flew at him like a small terrier attacking some big\r\nmastiff. All Lodovico's tact and courtesy were needed to allay the\r\nstorm, and when at length Merula died in 1494, the duke ordered the\r\nimmediate destruction of all the papers relating to this deplorable\r\ncontroversy, of which all parties, he felt, had good reason to be\r\nashamed. The remodelling of the library of the Castello di Pavia was\r\nanother important work which was carried out in the year 1492, by\r\nTristano Calco the historian and kinsman of the chief secretary, under\r\nthe eye of Lodovico himself, while he and Beatrice spent the summer at\r\nPavia. All the rare and precious manuscripts which he had been at such\r\npains to collect in France and Italy and Germany, and the ancient books\r\ncontained in the library were catalogued and arranged for the use of\r\nstudents. For Lodovico was not only bent on enriching the ducal library,\r\nbut was determined to make its treasures accessible to scholars of all\r\nnationalities. He allowed contemporary historians, Corio, Merula, and\r\nTristan Calco himself, to borrow manuscripts freely, and, what was even\r\nmore admirable in those days of persecution, gave permission under his\r\nown hand and seal to a Jewish scholar, named Salomone Ebreo, to live in\r\nthe Castello with his family, in order that he might translate Hebrew\r\nmanuscripts into Latin for the promotion of theological studies, and\r\nalso be enabled to study the text of the Hebrew Bible belonging to the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nIt is melancholy to reflect on the sad fate of this priceless\r\ncollection, upon which Lodovico and his ancestors had expended so much\r\ncare and thought. In 1499, the bulk of the library of the Castello was\r\ncarried off to Blois by Louis XII. and its precious contents were\r\ndispersed. Some were taken to Fontainebleau by Francis I. and afterwards\r\nby Henry Quatre to Paris, where they are still the glory of the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale. Others again found their way into different\r\npublic and private collections, and may be seen at Madrid and St.\r\nPetersburg, in London and Vienna, still bearing the inscription \"De\r\nPavye au roi Louis XII.,\" which tells us that they once formed part of\r\nthe Sforza Library. An illuminated manuscript of Aulus Gellius, and\r\nanother of the \"Triumphs\" of Petrarch, encircled with miniatures and\r\nbearing Lodovico's name, which originally belonged to the same\r\ncollection, are among the treasures of the Bibliothèque Nationale. Many\r\nmore no doubt have disappeared, lost in the general anarchy and\r\nconfusion which prevailed in the Milanese during the century after the\r\nMoro's fall.\r\n\r\nThe newly discovered art of printing was also liberally encouraged by\r\nLodovico, one of whose _protégés_, Alessandro Minuziano, set up a\r\nprinting press in Milan before Aldo Manuzio had settled in Venice, and\r\nin the course of the year 1494, published twenty-two books, including a\r\nLatin dictionary by Dionigi Este and complete editions of Cicero and\r\nTacitus, Pliny and Suetonius, as well as the works of Filelfo and the\r\nSonnets and Triumphs of Petrarch. In 1496, a treatise on music by\r\nFranchino Gaffuri was published, with a dedication to the duke, and was\r\nfollowed by the appearance of several works on harmony.\r\n\r\nThe munificence of Lodovico stirred up others to follow his example. His\r\nsecretary Bartolommeo Calco founded free schools, where Greek and Latin\r\nprofessors lectured free of charge to poor Milanese students; and two\r\nother noblemen, Tommaso Grassi and Tommaso Piatti, endowed similar\r\ninstitutions. The new passion for learning spread from Milan and Pavia\r\nto other cities, and even Lombard villages had their public schools and\r\nlecturers. Everywhere the same thirst for knowledge was felt and the\r\nsame respect for scholars was shown. For as Signor Lodovico wrote to his\r\nfriend Poliziano, at Florence, \"Both natural inclination and the example\r\nof our ancestors have inspired us with ardent love for learned men and\r\nan eager desire to honour and reward them to the best of our power.\"\r\n\r\nIf the intellectual movement which took place during the twenty years of\r\nLodovico Moro's rule in Milan commanded general admiration; if learning\r\nflourished there as it had never done before, the widespread revival of\r\nart in Lombardy was a still more remarkable feature of the period. This\r\nindeed was the province in which Lodovico's true genius was most\r\napparent, and in which his own fine taste, vast power of organization\r\nand minute attention to detail, all made themselves felt and bore rich\r\nfruit. \"This,\" wrote Isabella d'Este--herself no mean judge of these\r\nmatters--from Lodovico's court, \"is the school of the Master and of\r\nthose who know, the home of art and understanding.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the Milanese, architects and engineers, painters and\r\nsculptors, with a host of minor craftsmen, were carrying out the vast\r\nprojects that emanated from this one man. The decoration of the capital\r\nwas naturally among the chief objects of his ambition.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1492,\" writes the chronicler Cagnola, \"this glorious and\r\nmagnanimous prince adorned the Castello di Porta Zobia with many fair\r\nand marvellous buildings, enlarged the Piazza in front of the Castello,\r\nand removed obstructions in the streets of the city, and caused them to\r\nbe painted and beautified with frescoes. And he did the same in the city\r\nof Pavia, so that both these towns, that were formerly ugly and dirty,\r\nare now most beautiful, which things are very laudable and excellent,\r\nespecially in the eyes of those who remember these cities as they were\r\nof old, and who see them as they are to-day.\"\r\n\r\nChief among Lodovico's most honoured and trusted servants was Bramante\r\nof Urbino, whose genius excited so marked an influence on the\r\ndevelopment of Lombard architecture, and who was to the builders what\r\nLeonardo became to the painters of Milan. \"Signor Lodovico loved\r\nBramante greatly, and rewarded him richly,\" writes Fra Gaspare Bugati, a\r\nDominican friar of S. Maria delle Grazie, the Moro's favourite church,\r\nwhich this great architect did so much to beautify. During this year,\r\nBramante, having finished the palace of Vigevano and completed the new\r\nbuildings at the royal villas of Abbiategrasso, Cuzzago and other\r\nplaces, upon which he had been long engaged, began several important\r\nworks in Milan itself. The new cloister or Canonica attached to the\r\nancient basilica of S. Ambrogio, with its graceful columns and\r\ndark-green marble capitals, and the apse of S. Maria delle Grazie, soon\r\nto be crowned with that matchless cupola that remains among Bramante's\r\nmost perfect works, were both begun in 1492. A few years before, between\r\n1485 and 1490, he had built the Baptistery of San Satiro, which another\r\nof Lodovico's chosen artists, the great Como sculptor, Caradosso, was\r\nnow engaged in modelling the lovely terra-cotta frieze of children and\r\nthe medallions bearing, it is said, his own portrait and that of\r\nBramante. The noble church of S. Maria presso San Celso, which in\r\nBurckhardt's opinion combines magnificence and simplicity better than\r\nany building of the Renaissance, was the work of Bramante's assistant,\r\nDolcebuono, and owed its erection to the munificence of Lodovico, who\r\nlaid the first stone in 1491. Nor were churches and palaces the only\r\nbuildings upon which Lodovico lavished his gold and employed his most\r\ndistinguished masters. In those days, the hospitals of Rome, Florence,\r\nVenice and Siena were the finest in Europe, and when Luther visited\r\nRome, he is said to have been more impressed by the size and splendour\r\nof the hospitals, than by anything else in Italy. The great Moro,\r\ndetermined not to allow Milan to remain behind his age in this respect,\r\nemployed Bramante to adorn the Gothic buildings of the Ospedale Maggiore\r\nwith the arched windows and stately porticoes that we still admire,\r\nwhile he encircled the cloisters with marble shafts and terra-cotta\r\nmouldings after his own heart. And in 1488, after his own recovery from\r\nillness, and that terrible visitation of the plague which had carried\r\noff fifty thousand inhabitants of Milan in six months, Lodovico founded\r\nthe vast Lazzaretto, which still deserves its proud title, and may well\r\nbe called a \"glorious refuge for Christ's poor.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the works of the Duomo of Milan, that other great foundation\r\nof the Visconti dukes, were being vigorously carried on. In 1481,\r\nLodovico had nominated his favourite Pavian master, Amadeo, the\r\narchitect of the Certosa, as Capomaestro in succession to Guiniforte\r\nSolari; but the Councillors of the Fabric declined to accept his\r\nsuggestion, and sent to Strasburg for a German architect, John\r\nNexemperger of Graz, who held the office for some years, but effected\r\nlittle, and was finally dismissed in 1486. After his departure, the\r\nruinous state of the central cupola requiring immediate attention,\r\nLodovico invited Luca Fancelli, the chief architect of the Gonzagas at\r\nMantua, to visit Milan, and by his advice Leonardo, Bramante, and other\r\nleading masters were invited in 1487 to design models for a new cupola.\r\nOn this occasion Leonardo executed a model, which, however, does not\r\nseem to have satisfied the Fabbricieri, and after applying in vain to\r\nhis ambassador in Rome and Florence for a master able and willing to\r\nundertake the task, Lodovico returned to his first choice, and appointed\r\nAmadeo and Dolcebuono, architects of the Duomo, with powers to alter and\r\nperfect the models of the cupola submitted to them for inspection. In\r\norder to strengthen their hands and satisfy himself, Lodovico invited\r\nLuca Fancelli of Mantua and Francesco Martini of Siena to decide on the\r\nrespective merits of the models already prepared. Caradosso was sent to\r\nconduct Martini from Siena, while Gaffuri, Professor of Music, escorted\r\nFancelli from Mantua by the duke's orders, and both masters were richly\r\nrewarded for the pains and presented with silken vests and clothes for\r\ntheir servants over and above the pay to which they were entitled.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June, 1490, a meeting was held in the Castello, at which\r\nLodovico presided, and after much deliberation the final execution of\r\nthe cupola was entrusted to Amadeo and Dolcebuono. Bramante himself was\r\nnot present on this occasion, but he approved highly of the model\r\nselected, and praised its lightness and elegance.\r\n\r\nAs for Leonardo, he was absorbed in other studies, and had apparently\r\nceased to take any interest in the subject. After allowing his first\r\nmodel to be spoilt, and receiving payment for a second which he never\r\nbegan, he had, as already mentioned, accompanied the Sienese architect,\r\nMartini, to Pavia, to give his opinion on the new Duomo in course of\r\nerection. There he lingered, studying anatomy or discussing scientific\r\nand philosophical questions with the University professors, until he was\r\nrecalled to Milan, to assist in the preparations for Beatrice's wedding\r\n_fêtes_. Many and varied were the tasks on which Leonardo had been\r\nemployed since the day, some eight years before, when the Magnificent\r\nMedici first sent him to his friend at Milan. In the letter which the\r\nyoung master, proudly conscious of his powers, himself addressed to\r\nLodovico Sforza, offering him his services, he had, first of all,\r\nretailed at length his different inventions \"for the construction of\r\nbridges, cannons, engines, and catapults of fair and useful shape\r\nhitherto unknown, but of admirable efficiency in time of war,\" after\r\nwhich he proceeded to give the following account of his artistic\r\ncapacities:--\r\n\r\n\"In time of peace I believe I can equal any man in constructing public\r\nbuildings and conducting water from one place to another. I can execute\r\nsculpture, whether in marble, bronze, or terra-cotta, and in painting I\r\nam the equal of any master, be he who he may. Again, I will undertake to\r\nexecute the bronze horse to the immortal glory and eternal honour of the\r\nduke, your father, of blessed memory, and of the illustrious House of\r\nSforza. And if any of the things I have mentioned above should seem to\r\nyou impossible and impracticable, I will gladly make trial of them in\r\nyour park, or any other place that may please your Excellency, to whom I\r\ncommend myself in all humility.\"\r\n\r\nThe master had kept his word, and justified the confidence which from\r\nthe first Lodovico Sforza placed in him. According to Vasari and the\r\nbiographer of the Magliabecchiana, who wrote about 1540, Leonardo\r\noriginally attracted the Moro's notice by the surpassing charm with\r\nwhich he played on a silver lyre of his own invention, and afterwards\r\nfascinated him by his conversation. But from the moment of his arrival\r\nat Milan the Florentine artist was employed by his new master to paint\r\nportraits and frescoes, to construct canals, arrange masques and\r\npageants, or invent mechanical contrivances for use on the stage or in\r\nthe house. A thousand different studies in his sketch-books and\r\nmanuscripts bear witness to the strange variety of subjects upon which\r\nhis versatile genius was brought to bear. But the most important work\r\nupon which Leonardo was engaged, and that which lay nearest to Lodovico\r\nSforza's heart, was the equestrian statue of Duke Francesco Sforza.\r\nThis, we learn from the master's own words, was the true reason that\r\nbrought him to Milan. In a letter to the Fabbricieri of the Duomo of\r\nPiacenza, he describes himself as Leonardo the Florentine whom Signor\r\nLodovico brought to Milan to make the bronze horse, and says that he can\r\nundertake no other task, for this will fill his whole life, if indeed it\r\nis ever finished! Countless were the designs, endless the different\r\nforms which the great master made for this model, which was, after all,\r\nnever to be cast in bronze, and was destined to perish by the hands of\r\nFrench archers. At one time it seemed as if he could neither satisfy\r\nhimself nor yet his master. In July, 1489, Pietro Alamanni, one of\r\nLorenzo de' Medici's agents, wrote to ask his master if he could send\r\nanother artist capable of executing the work to the Milanese court.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Lodovico,\" he says, \"wishes to raise a noble memorial to his\r\nfather, and has already charged Leonardo da Vinci to prepare a model for\r\na great bronze horse, with a figure of Duke Francesco in armour. But\r\nsince His Excellency is anxious to have something superlatively fine,\r\nhe desires me to write and beg you to send him another master, for\r\nalthough he has given the work to Leonardo, he does not feel satisfied\r\nthat he is equal to the task.\"\r\n\r\nProbably Lodovico's confidence had been shaken by Leonardo's endless\r\ndelays and hesitation, but a few months later the master was at work\r\nagain, this time it appears on a completely new model of the great\r\nstatue. On April, 1490, we find the following memorandum in Leonardo's\r\nwriting:--\r\n\r\n\"To-day I commenced this book, and began the horse again.\"\r\n\r\nBut soon another interruption came to interfere with the progress of the\r\ngreat work. There was the visit to Pavia, and the decoration of the\r\nball-room in the Castello, and the wedding _fêtes_, and the tournaments\r\nin which Messer Galeazzo sought his help. And in this year--1492--we\r\nfind Leonardo at Vigevano with the Moro in March, making designs for a\r\nnew staircase for the Sforzesca, and studying vine-culture, and later in\r\nthe summer drawing plans of a bath-room for Duchess Beatrice, and of a\r\npavilion with a round cupola for the duke's labyrinth in the gardens of\r\nthe Castello. It was in this same year, according to Amoretti, that he\r\nfinished the beautiful painting of the Holy Family, upon which he had\r\nlong been engaged. This may have been the picture ordered by Lodovico as\r\na gift for the art-loving King of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus, when his\r\nniece Bianca Maria was betrothed to that monarch's son.\r\n\r\n\"Since we hear that His Majesty delights in pictures,\" wrote Lodovico to\r\nMaffeo di Treviglio, the ambassador whom he was sending to Hungary in\r\n1485, \"and we have here a most excellent painter, with whose genius we\r\nare well acquainted, and who, we are sure, has no equal, we have ordered\r\nthis master to paint a figure of Our Lady, as beautiful and perfect and\r\nholy as he can imagine, without sparing pains or expense. He has already\r\nset to work, and will undertake nothing else until this picture is\r\nfinished, and we are able to send it as a gift to his said Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe painter who had no equal could be none other than Leonardo; but it\r\nwould be interesting to know if this picture, originally destined for\r\nMatthias Corvinus, was the Nativity eventually given by Lodovico in 1493\r\nto Bianca Maria's future husband, the Emperor Maximilian. All traces of\r\nthis altar-piece, however, as well as of the Bacchus and other subjects\r\nwhich Leonardo painted for the Moro, have vanished; and the only works\r\nthat remain to us of his Milanese period are the cartoon of the Virgin\r\nand St. Anne now in the Royal Academy, and the \"Vierge aux Rochers\" in\r\nthe Louvre, which was originally painted between 1490 and 1494 for a\r\nchapel in San Francesco of Milan, the church where the great Condottiere\r\nRoberto di Sanseverino was piously buried by his sons, after his death\r\nin the battle of Trent. The fame which Leonardo had attained, and the\r\nhigh esteem in which he was held by the Moro, is proved by the verses of\r\ncontemporary poets, and especially by those of his fellow-countryman,\r\nBellincioni, the court-poet who died in 1492.\r\n\r\n\"To-day,\" he sings, \"Milan is the new Athens! Here Lodovico holds his\r\nParnassus; here rare and excellent artists flock as bees to seek honey\r\nfrom the flowers; here, chief among them all, is the new Apelles whom he\r\nhas brought from Florence.\" In the volume of Bellincioni's Sonnets,\r\npublished soon after his death by the priest Francesco Tanzio, the name\r\nMagistro Leonardo da Vinci appears in a marginal note, and in another\r\nsonnet inscribed to \"Four illustrious men who have grown up under the\r\nshadow of the Moro,\" the editor gives the respective names of these\r\nfamous individuals as \"the painter Maestro Leonardo Florentino, the\r\ngoldsmith Caradosso, the learned Greek scholar Giorgio Merula, called\r\nthe sun of Alessandria, and Maestro Giannino, the Ferrarese\r\ngun-founder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rejoice, O Milano,\" sings the poet in these verses--\"rejoice above all,\r\nthat within your walls you hold one who is foremost among excellent\r\nartists, Da Vinci, whose drawing and colouring are alike unrivalled by\r\nancient or modern masters.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that Lodovico was able to keep this great master at his court\r\nduring so long a period is the best proof we have of his knowledge of\r\nmen and love of art. These sixteen years were the most brilliant and\r\nproductive of Leonardo's life. Never again was he to enjoy a freedom\r\nand independence so complete, never again was he to find a master as\r\ngenerous, as stimulating to his powers of brain and hand as the great\r\nMoro. It was not only that Signor Lodovico gave him the large salary of\r\n2000 ducats--about £4000 of our money--\"besides many other gifts and\r\nrewards,\" as Leonardo himself told Cardinal de Gurk, but that he was\r\nhimself so fine a connoisseur and understanding a patron. More than\r\nthis, he knew how to deal with men of genius, and could make allowance\r\nfor their wayward fancies, and humour their caprices with infinite tact\r\nand kindliness. And from the little that we glean of his intercourse\r\nwith Leonardo, he seems to have treated him rather as an equal than as a\r\nsubject, and more like a friend than a servant.\r\n\r\nThe glimpses that we catch of Leonardo's private life from the writings\r\nof contemporaries, whether in Bandello's _novelle_, or in Bellincioni's\r\n_rime_, all give the same pleasant impression, and show the ease and\r\nliberty which he enjoyed at the court of Milan. And in his own\r\n\"Trattato\" (Cap. 36) the painter describes himself as living in a fine\r\nhouse, full of beautiful paintings and choice objects, surrounded by\r\nmusicians and poets. Here he sits at his work, handling a brush full of\r\nlovely colour, never so happy as when he can paint listening to the\r\nsound of sweet melodies. The spacious atelier is full of scholars and\r\napprentices employed in carrying out their master's ideas or making\r\nchemical experiments, but careless of the noise of tools and hammers,\r\nthe fair-haired boy Angelo sings his golden song, and Serafino the\r\nwondrous _improvisatore_ chants his own verses to the sound of the lyre.\r\nVisitors come and go freely--Messer Jacopo of Ferrara, the architect who\r\nwas \"dear to Leonardo as a brother,\" the courtly poet Gaspare Visconti,\r\nand Vincenzo Calmeta, Duchess Beatrice's secretary, or, it may be, the\r\ngreat Messer Galeaz himself, whose big jennet and Sicilian horse the\r\nmaster has been drawing as models for the great equestrian statue\r\nstanding outside in the Corte Vecchia. There, among them all, the\r\npainter bends over his canvas seeking to perfect the glazes and scumbles\r\nof his pearly tints, or trying to realize some dream of a face that\r\nhaunts his fancy with its exquisite smile. He has, it is true, many\r\nlabours--\"_a tanta faccenda!_\" as he wrote to the councillors of\r\nPiacenza--and at times he hardly knows which way to turn, but he is his\r\nown master, free to work as he will, now at one, now at another. He has\r\nno cares or anxiety. He can dress as he pleases, wear rich apparel if he\r\nis so minded, or don the plain clothes and sober hues that he prefers.\r\nHe has gold enough and to spare; he can help a poorer friend and educate\r\na needy apprentice, or save his money for a rainy day; and, above all,\r\nhe has plenty of books and leisure to meditate on philosophical\r\ntreatises, or ponder over the scientific problems in which his soul\r\ndelights. He can find time to jot down his thoughts on many things, to\r\nwrite his great treatise on painting, and to draw the wonderful\r\ninterlaced patterns inscribed with the strange words which have puzzled\r\nso many generations of commentators. And he has friends, too, dear to\r\nhis heart--Messer Jacopo, and the wise Lorenzo da Pavia, that master of\r\norgans whose hands were as deft in fashioning lyres and viols as in\r\ndrawing out sweet sounds, with whom he loved to commune of musical\r\ninstruments and eternal harmonies, and the boy Andrea Salai, with the\r\nbeautiful curling hair, whom he loved to dress up in green velvet\r\nmantles, and shoes with rose-coloured ribbons and silver buckles.\r\n\r\n\"Such,\" he tells us, \"was I, Leonardo the Florentine, at the court of\r\nthe most Illustrious Prince Signor Lodovic.\" And what the Moro was to\r\nLeonardo that he showed himself to other artists and men of letters. In\r\nthe poet's words, he was the magnet who drew men of genius (_virtuosi_)\r\nfrom all parts of the world to Milan. He might be an exacting and\r\ncritical master, he was certainly never satisfied with any work short of\r\nthe best--even Leonardo, we have seen, did not always find him easy to\r\nplease--but once he discovered a man who was excellent in any branch of\r\nknowledge, he thought no cost too great to retain him at his court. And\r\nso the foremost scholars and the finest artists, Giorgio Merula and\r\nLancinus Curtius, Caradosso and Cristoforo Romano, Bramante and\r\nLeonardo, were all drawn to Milan in turn, and, having once entered the\r\nMoro's service, remained there until the end.\r\n\r\n\"We know, O most illustrious Prince!\" wrote Tanzio in his preface to\r\nBellincioni's Sonnets--\"we know that you, the Chief of the Insubrians,\r\nare no less a lover of your country than of your glorious father, in\r\nwhose honour you have reared that mighty and immortal work, the great\r\nColossus, which, like himself, remains without a rival. We see you\r\nequally anxious to glorify both his memory and your own great city. We\r\nsee Milan, by your care, not only adorned with peace and wealth, with\r\nnoble churches and edifices, but with rare and admirable intellects, who\r\nall turn to you in their hour of need, as the rivers flow into the vast\r\nocean.\"\r\n\r\nNor was it only in Milan and Pavia that this revival made itself felt.\r\nThe new impulse spread from city to city. The lovely Renaissance façade\r\nof S. Maria dei Miracoli at Brescia was completed in 1487, and the great\r\nChurch of the Incoronata at Lodi, begun in 1488, was continued during\r\nthe next twenty years under the superintendence of Dolcebuono and\r\nAmadeo. Bramante supplied designs for the new façade and portals that\r\nwere added to the cathedral of Como in 1491, and for the majestic church\r\nof Abbiategrasso, close to this favourite country house of the Sforzas.\r\nA number of other churches, both in Milan and the neighbourhood, were\r\ndesigned by him or his scholars, and bear witness to the revolution\r\nwhich he had effected in Lombard architecture. At Piacenza and Cremona,\r\nat Saronno and Lugano, new churches and palaces arose, and the famous\r\nSanctuary of Varallo in the Val Sesia was founded in 1491 by that devout\r\npersonage, Messer Bernardino Caimo, on his return from a pilgrimage to\r\nthe Holy Land. The same passion for building and decoration prevailed\r\neverywhere. On all sides poets and scholars celebrated Lodovico's name\r\nas the Pericles of this new Athens, and joined in the chorus of praise\r\nwhich inspired Pistoia's famous line--\r\n\r\n\"E un Dio in cielo e il Moro in terra.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one God in heaven and the Moro upon earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBeatrice d'Este as a patron of learning and poetry--Vincenzo Calmeta,\r\nher secretary--Serafino d'Aquila--Rivalry of Lombard and Tuscan poets\r\n--Gaspare Visconti's works--Poetic jousts with Bramante--Niccolo di\r\nCorreggio and other poets--Dramatic art and music at the court of\r\nMilan--Gaffuri and Testagrossa--Lorenzo Gusnasco of Pavia.\r\n\r\n1492\r\n\r\n\r\nLodovico Moro, as we have seen, was justly extolled by his\r\ncontemporaries as the most illustrious Mecænas of his age. As Abbé\r\nTiraboschi, the learned historian of Italian literature, wrote ninety\r\nyears ago, \"If we consider the immense number of learned men who flocked\r\nto his court from all parts of Italy in the certainty of receiving great\r\nhonours and rich rewards; if, again, we remember how many famous\r\narchitects and painters he invited to Milan, and how many noble\r\nbuildings he raised, how he built and endowed the magnificent University\r\nof Pavia, and opened schools of every kind of science in Milan; if\r\nbesides all this we read the splendid eulogies and dedicatory epistles\r\naddressed to him by scholars of every nationality, we feel inclined to\r\npronounce him the best prince that ever lived.\" And in Beatrice d'Este,\r\nLodovico possessed a wife admirably adapted to share his aims and\r\npreside over his court. Both her birth and education fitted her for the\r\nposition which she now occupied. Her youth and beauty lent a new lustre\r\nto the court, her quick intelligence and cultured tastes led her to\r\nappreciate the society of poets and scholars. The natural love of\r\nsplendour, which she shared with the Moro, went hand-in-hand with\r\nartistic invention. Her rich clothes and jewels were distinguished by\r\ntheir refinement and rare workmanship. The fashions which she\r\nintroduced were marked by their elegance and beauty. She took especial\r\ndelight in music and poetry, and gave signs of a fine and discriminating\r\nliterary judgment. And like Lodovico, she knew not only how to attract\r\nmen of genius, but how to retain them in her service. Where, again, asks\r\nCastiglione, who had known her in her brightest days at Milan, shall we\r\nfind a woman of intellect as remarkable as Duchess Beatrice? And her own\r\nsecretary, the writer known as \"_l'elegantissimo_ Calmeta\" in the\r\ncultured circles of Mantua and Urbino, has told us how much men of\r\nletters owed to her sympathy and help. In the life of his friend,\r\nSerafino Aquilano, written seven years after Beatrice's death, when the\r\nMilanese was a French province and the Moro a captive at Loches, Calmeta\r\nrecalls the brilliant days of his old life at Lodovico's court, and\r\nspeaks thus of his lost mistress:--\r\n\r\n\"This duke had for his most dear wife Beatrice d'Este, daughter of\r\nErcole, Duke of Ferrara, who, coming to Milan in the flower of her\r\nopening youth, was endowed with so rare an intellect, so much grace and\r\naffability, and was so remarkable for her generosity and goodness that\r\nshe may justly be compared with the noblest women of antiquity. This\r\nduchess devoted her time to the highest objects. Her court was composed\r\nof men of talent and distinction, most of whom were poets and musicians,\r\nwho were expected to compose new eclogues, comedies, or tragedies, and\r\narrange new spectacles and representations every month. In her leisure\r\nhours she generally employed a certain Antonio Grifo\"--a well-known\r\nstudent and commentator of Dante--\"or some equally gifted man, to read\r\nthe Divina Commedia, or the works of other Italian poets, aloud to her.\r\nAnd it was no small relaxation of mind for Lodovico Sforza, when he was\r\nable to escape from the cares and business of state, to come and listen\r\nto these readings in his wife's rooms. And among the illustrious men\r\nwhose presence adorned the court of the duchess there were three\r\nhigh-born cavaliers, renowned for many talents, but above all for their\r\npoetic gifts--Niccolo da Correggio, Gaspare Visconti, and Antonio di\r\nCampo Fregoso, together with many others, one of whom was myself,\r\nVincenzo Calmeta, who for some years held the post of secretary to that\r\nglorious and excellent lady. And besides those I have named there was\r\nBenedetto da Cingoli, called Piceno, and many other youths of no small\r\npromise, who daily offered her the first fruits of their genius. Nor was\r\nDuchess Beatrice content with rewarding and honouring the poets of her\r\nown court. On the contrary, she sent to all parts of Italy to inquire\r\nfor the compositions of elegant poets, and placed their books as sacred\r\nand divine things on the shelves of her cabinet of study, and praised\r\nand rewarded each writer according to his merit. In this manner, poetry\r\nand literature in the vulgar tongue, which had degenerated and sunk into\r\nforgetfulness after the days of Petrarch and Boccaccio, has been\r\nrestored to its former dignity, first by the protection of Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici, and then by the influence of this rare lady, and others like\r\nher, who are still living at the present time. But when Duchess Beatrice\r\ndied everything fell into ruin. That court, which had been a joyous\r\nParadise, became a dark and gloomy Inferno, and poets and artists were\r\nforced to seek another road.\"\r\n\r\nCalmeta himself was a prolific writer both of verse and prose, whose\r\ntranslation of Ovid's _Ars amandi_, dedicated to Lodovico Moro, was\r\nhighly esteemed by his contemporaries, and whom Castiglione introduces\r\namong the speakers of his _Cortigiano_. Like his friends Niccolo da\r\nCorreggio and Gaspare Visconti, Beatrice's secretary was a fervent\r\nadmirer of Petrarch, and wrote an elaborate commentary on the _Canzone_,\r\n\"_Mai non vo' più cantar como io solea_,\" which he dedicated to Isabella\r\nd'Este and sent her with a letter expressing his conviction that no one\r\nbefore him had ever fully understood this profound and subtle poem.\r\nAnother of Beatrice's _protégés_ was Serafino, the famous improvisatore\r\nof Aquila in the Abruzzi, a short and ugly little man, whom Cardinal\r\nBibbiena once laughingly compared to a carpet-bag (_valigia_)! But in\r\nspite of his dwarfed stature and elfish appearance, Serafino sang his\r\nown _strambotti_ and eclogues so well, and had so fascinating a way of\r\naccompanying himself on the lute, that the Este and Gonzaga ladies all\r\nentreated him for new verses, and literally wrangled over the man\r\nhimself! Like Calmeta and many others, however, after spending some time\r\nat the courts of Mantua and Urbino, he came to Milan, and devoted his\r\ntalents to the service of Duchess Beatrice until her death, after which\r\nhe went his way sadly, and sought shelter in his old haunts. Most of his\r\ntime after this was spent with the good Duchess Elizabeth at Urbino,\r\nwhere the Milanese refugees found a warm welcome, and where Serafino was\r\ncaressed and _fêted_ by all the great ladies in turn, until a premature\r\ndeath closed his career, and he died in Rome in 1500, lamented in prose\r\nand verse by the most cultured spirits of the age.\r\n\r\nWhile Beatrice encouraged these foreign poets to settle at Milan,\r\nLodovico invited the Tuscans Bellincioni and Antonio Cammelli, surnamed\r\nPistoia, to his court, in the hope of refining and polishing the rude\r\nLombard diction. The priest Tanzio, writing after Bellincioni's death in\r\n1492, remarks that this influence had already borne fruit, and that the\r\nsonnet, which was practically unknown in Milan before Bellincioni's\r\ncoming, was now diligently cultivated there. But, not unnaturally, a\r\nbitter rivalry sprung up between the Lombard and the Tuscan poets, and a\r\nfierce poetic warfare was exchanged between them. Bellincioni's\r\nsuspicious and quarrelsome nature is revealed in his letters to his\r\npatron, in which he is always complaining of the envious detractors\r\nwhose wicked tongues are employed in backbiting him day and night. His\r\nown character was by no means free from the same imputations; and the\r\nFerrarese poet, Tebaldeo, the friend of Raphael and Castiglione,\r\ncomposed a witty epitaph, in which he warns passers-by to avoid the last\r\nresting-place of this singer, who had made so many enemies in life, lest\r\nhe turn in his grave and bite them. Bellincioni's bitterest foe was a\r\ncertain Bergamasque poet, Guidotto Prestinari, who wrote many odes and\r\nsongs in honour of Beatrice, and represented the old Lombard school. On\r\none occasion this misguided person even dared to attack Leonardo, and\r\nwrote a sonnet in which he jeers at the great painter for spending his\r\ntime in hunting for curious worms and insects on the hills of Bergamo,\r\nwhen he visited his friends of the Melzi family. Leonardo scorned to\r\ntake any notice of these petty insults, but in his letter to the\r\ncouncillors of Piacenza we see the contempt which he had for Lombard\r\nartists--\"those rude and ignorant workmen,\" as he calls them, \"who boast\r\nthey will get letters of recommendation from Signora Lodovico or his\r\nCommissioner of Works, Messer Ambrogio Ferrari, when not one of them is\r\nfit to undertake the task.\" And certain epigrams in the Windsor\r\nSketchbook are plainly directed against the false and venal science of\r\nthe astrologer Ambrogio da Rosate, whose name is given in the margin,\r\nand show how cordial was Leonardo's hatred of the duke's all-powerful\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nFortunately, both Leonardo himself, as well as Calmeta and Pistoia, were\r\non friendly terms with Gaspare Visconti, who, originally a scholar of\r\nPrestinari, became the chief representative of the Lombard school of\r\npoetry at Milan, and whom Beatrice's secretary places next to Niccolo da\r\nCorreggio among the best poets of her court. This popular poet and\r\npolished cavalier was a great favourite, not only with Beatrice and her\r\nhusband, but with Galeazzo di Sanseverino, the Marchesino Stanga, and\r\nall the chief personages at court. Born in 1461 of noble Milanese\r\nparents, he married Cecilia, daughter of Cecco Simonetta, Duchess Bona's\r\nill-fated minister, and was advanced to the dignity of _Eques Auratus_\r\nand ducal councillor. After the death of Bellincioni he succeeded to the\r\npost of court poet, and was often employed by Lodovico to address\r\ncomplimentary verses to other princes or to write sonnets on passing\r\nevents, whether his theme were a royal wedding or the death of a\r\nfavourite falcon. His most important work was a romance entitled \"Paolo\r\ne Daria,\" founded on Bramante's discovery of a tomb containing the ashes\r\nof these lovers, when the foundations of his new cloisters at S.\r\nAmbrogio were being laid in the year 1492. The incident excited great\r\ninterest at court, and Gasparo dedicated his poem to Lodovico--\"_mio\r\nDuca_\"--and introduced an eloquent eulogy in honour of his friend\r\nBramante in the first canto. In the following year he published a volume\r\nof rhymes, dedicated to Niccolo da Correggio, who sent the book to the\r\ninsatiable Isabella d'Este, saying this would please her better than any\r\nverses that he could write. Finally, in 1496, he formally presented the\r\nduchess with a copy of his poems, written in silver letters and gold on\r\nivory vellum, and enriched with miniatures of rare beauty. This\r\nsumptuous volume, bound in silver-gilt boards enamelled with flowers,\r\nand containing 143 sonnets as well as epistles on love and other\r\nphilosophical and theological subjects, was dedicated to Beatrice in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n\"To the Most Illustrious Duchess of Milan, Gaspare Visconti, Having\r\nbeen told by many honourable persons, chief among whom is Messer\r\nGaleazzo Sanseverino, that the said duchess graciously pleads my cause\r\nwith His Excellency the Duke, I beg of her to accept this book,\r\ndedicated to her by her humble servant.\" The same grateful sentiments\r\ninspired the lyric which followed, in which the poet implored the\r\nduchess to use her well-known influence with her lord, and incline his\r\nwill to look favourably upon her servant's prayer--\r\n\r\n\"Donna beata! e Spirito pudico!\r\nDeh! fa benigna a questa mia richiesta\r\nLa voglia del tuo Sposo Lodovico.\r\n    Io so ben quel che dico!\r\nTanta è la tua virtu che ció che vuoi\r\nDello invitto cuor disponer puoi.\"[24]\r\n\r\nAn ardent lover of Petrarch, to whose poems these of the Milanese poet\r\nwere often compared by his admirers, Gaspare Visconti took the lead in a\r\nlively poetic contest with Bramante on the respective merits of Dante\r\nand Petrarch, The discussion was carried on during many weeks, in the\r\npresence of the duchess and her courtiers in the beautiful gardens of\r\nVigevano, or in those fair pleasure-houses by the running streams in the\r\npark at Pavia, where Beatrice and her ladies spent the long summer days.\r\nGaspare found animated supporters in his friends Calmeta and Niccolo da\r\nCorreggio, who was himself an enthusiastic admirer of Petrarch, and on\r\none occasion journeyed twenty-five miles from Correggio over the worst\r\nroads in the world to see the remote village of Rosena, where the Tuscan\r\npoet had composed some of his finest _canzoni_. On the other hand,\r\nBramante had the duke and duchess on his side. We know how, at the end\r\nof a long day's work, Lodovico loved to listen to the reading of the\r\n\"Divina Commedia\" in his wife's boudoir, and ponder the meaning of that\r\ngreat vision of heaven and hell. And when the catastrophe of Novara had\r\ncrushed his last hopes, and he was borne a captive into the strange\r\nland, the only favour he asked of his victors was the loan of a volume\r\nof Dante, \"_per studiare_\"--in order that he might study the divine\r\npoet's words. One of Gaspare's sonnets on the subject, which was\r\nafterwards printed, bears this inscription: \"These verses were not\r\nwritten with any pretence of deciding between the merits of these two\r\ngreat men, but solely to answer Bramante, who is a violent partisan of\r\nDante.\"\r\n\r\nAnother poetic tourney, in which both the great architect and his friend\r\nVisconti were the chief combatants, turned on Bramante's supposed\r\npoverty and the complaints with which he filled the air, calling on all\r\nthe gods in heaven to help him in his misery. This was in the summer of\r\n1492, and not only Gaspare, but Bellincioni, who was then living, and\r\nMascagni of Turin took up the parable, and charged Bramante with begging\r\nfor a pair of shoes, when all the while he was receiving five ducats a\r\nweek from the duke, and was secretly hoarding up a store of gold. To\r\nthis Bramante replied in a sonnet full of allusions to Calliope, Erato,\r\nand all the Muses, begging his friends for pity's sake to give him a\r\ncrown, if they would not see him left barefoot and naked to battle with\r\nrude Boreas. A whole series of curious sonnets from Bramante's pen has\r\nbeen lately discovered by M. Müntz among the Italian manuscripts in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, and reveal the burlesque side of the great\r\narchitect's character, and the biting wit which made his opponents give\r\nhim the name of Cerberus.[25]\r\n\r\nThese poetic jousts or encounters of wits were a favourite amusement of\r\nthe cultured princesses of the Renaissance and their courtiers. Thus it\r\nwas that Poliziano and Ficino discussed philosophical questions before\r\nLorenzo in the gardens of Careggi or on the terraces of Fiesole; so\r\nCastiglione and Bibbiena reasoned of art and love with Duchess Elizabeth\r\nand Emilia Pia, in the palace of Urbino, till the short summer night was\r\nwell-nigh over and the dawn broke over the peaks of Monte Catria. And at\r\nMilan, where in Beatrice's days there was less pedantry and more freedom\r\nand gaiety than in any court of the day, these lively debates found\r\nespecial favour. The most brilliant courtiers and bravest knights, the\r\ngravest scholars and officers of state alike took part in them. Messer\r\nGaleazzo, as we have seen, was an adept at the game, and could wield his\r\npen and challenge fair ladies in defence of Roland as gallantly as he\r\ncouched his lance to ride in the lists or wielded his sword in the thick\r\nof the battle. So, too were the Marchesino Stanga and his friend\r\nGirolamo Tuttavilla. Both these noblemen were great sonnet-writers, and\r\nare classed by Pistoia among those illustrious lords, who, like Messer\r\nGaleazzo and Signor Lodovico himself, were poets and writers as well as\r\nstatesmen and generals.\r\n\r\nBramante addressed several of his sonnets to Count Tuttavilla, who in\r\nhis turn had a lively controversy in rhyme with the Marchesino. And\r\nwhen, in the spring of 1492, Tuttavilla accompanied the Count of Caiazzo\r\non his embassy to France, Gaspare Visconti sent him a sonnet asking for\r\nthe latest news from Paris, which Duchess Beatrice and all her ladies\r\nwere dying to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me if the Queen of France is fair, and how the king appears in\r\nyour eyes--whether he is cruel or clement, inclined to walk in the paths\r\nof virtue or of vice. And tell us, too, if the people of Paris seem to\r\nfear the English and the Spaniard, and if they are true followers of\r\nMars? Tell us how the crowds who walk the streets are clad, and what\r\ncustoms and manners they have, and how they speak, and what they think.\r\nTell me how many students their University numbers, and in what branches\r\nof learning they excel. Tell me the names of their lawgivers and\r\nhistorians, and if any classical antiquities are to be found in Paris.\r\nTell me how the Abbey of S. Denis is built, and what style of\r\narchitecture prevails in the far North? And tell me, too, if I dare ask,\r\nhave you perchance in Paris found some fair lady to bend a gracious\r\nsmile upon you, and console you for all that you have left behind?\"\r\n\r\nGirolamo Tuttavilla replied in verses of the same light and airy strain,\r\nalluding to the fierce contest over Dante that waged between Dottore\r\nBramante and his foes, and laughing at friend Bellincioni's furious\r\nrages, but saying that he at least is wiser, and will take the _viâ\r\nmedia_ and steer warily between the two contending parties.\r\n\r\nBut the best poet at Lodovico's court, a sweeter singer and a finer\r\nscholar than the much-praised Bellincioni or the gay Visconti, was\r\nNiccolo, the \"gran Correggio\" of Gaspare's song. The son of that\r\naccomplished princess of Este, Beatrice the Queen of Festivals, reared\r\nby her in all the culture of Ferrara, this singularly polished and\r\nhandsome personage was in the eyes of his contemporaries the model of a\r\nperfect courtier. To have known him was in itself a liberal education.\r\nSabba da Castiglione, that fastidious scholar and refined writer of the\r\nsixteenth century, counted himself fortunate because as a boy he had\r\nseen and known \"this most famous, most courteous and gifted cavalier in\r\nall Italy.\" Ariosto saw him in his vision upholding the Fountain of\r\nSong, and chanting in his own lofty and noble style--\r\n\r\n          \"Un Signor di Correggio\r\nCon alto stil par che cantando scriva.\"\r\n\r\nNiccolo had come to Milan in Beatrice's bridal train, and remained there\r\never since, highly valued and beloved by Lodovico and all the ducal\r\nfamily, riding in jousts and tournaments, going on foreign missions, and\r\ncomposing songs and eclogues for that young duchess whose death was one\r\nday to inspire some of his most touching verses. But the Marchesa\r\nIsabella was the true goddess of his adoration, the mistress to whom his\r\nheart and lyre alike were pledged, who was for him, not only \"_la mia\r\npatrona e signora_,\" but \"_la prima donna del mondo_,\" \"the first lady\r\nin all the world.\" For her he translated Breton legends and Provençal\r\nromances; for her he set Virgil and Petrarch to music; for her fair\r\nsake, old and stiff as advancing years have made him, he is ready to\r\nbreak a lance or join once more in the dance. At Christmas-time, in the\r\nlast days of 1491, the impatient Marchesana had written to remind him\r\nthat she had never yet received the eclogue which he had promised to\r\nsend her at her brother Alfonso's wedding, and refused to be put off\r\nwith any other verses, saying that his poems pleased her more than those\r\nof any living bard. When in later years she found that Niccolo was\r\ninclined to transfer his allegiance to her sister-in-law, Lucrezia\r\nBorgia, she was sorely affronted, and after his death entered into a\r\nlong contention for the possession of the book of poems which he had\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\nThere were many other poets of Beatrice's court whose names were famous\r\nin their day, but have long ago been forgotten, and whose works have\r\npassed into oblivion with all that vanished world. There was Lancino di\r\nCorte, or, as he preferred to style himself, Lancinus Curtius, the\r\nwriter of Latin epigrams; and Antonio di Fregoso, the noble Genoese\r\nyouth who, like Niccolo, won Calmeta and Ariosto's praises, and whose\r\npoetic disputes with Lancinus were a feature of Cecilia Gallerani's\r\nentertainments; and Baldassare Taccone of Alessandria; and Pietro\r\nLazzarone of the Valtellina. There was Galeotto del Carretto, the\r\nMontferrat poet and historian, who left his home at Casale to compose\r\nplays and sonnets for Beatrice, and who, like Niccolo da Correggio, was\r\none of Isabella's favourite correspondents, and sent her eclogues and\r\nstrambotti to sing to the lute. When Beatrice died he had just finished\r\na comedy dedicated to this princess, which he afterwards sent to\r\nIsabella, begging her to accept it both for his sake and that of the\r\nlamented _Madonna Duchessa sorella_, who had taken pleasure in reading\r\nhis effusions. And there was another Tuscan poet, Antonio Cammelli of\r\nPistoia, who composed a whole volume of sonnets dedicated to \"that most\r\ninvincible Prince, the light and splendour of the world, Lodovico Moro.\"\r\nThese sonnets are of great interest, less on account of their poetic\r\nmerit than because of the fidelity with which they commemorate political\r\nevents. The invasion of the French, the conquest of Naples, the battle\r\nof Fornovo, the peace of Vercelli, the proclamation of Lodovico as Duke\r\nof Milan, his coronation _fêtes_ at Milan and Pavia, are all carefully\r\nrecorded. Nor does the series end here; in another sonnet the poet takes\r\nup the note of warning, and bids Lodovico beware of the new King of\r\nFrance and, ceasing to dally with Fortune, prepare to defend his fair\r\nduchy. The next time Pistoia took up his pen, it was to wail over the\r\nduke's fall and the ruin of Italy, and to hurl curses on the head of the\r\nfalse servants who had betrayed their trust and yielded up the Castello\r\nto their master's foes. This, at least, may be said to Pistoia's\r\ncredit--he did not forget his generous patron in the days of adversity;\r\nand when Pamfilo Sasso, the Modena bard who had basked in the sunshine\r\nof the Moro's favour, assailed the fallen duke in his verses, Pistoia\r\nrose up in defence of his old master, and fiercely rebuked the cowardly\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n\"I send you,\" wrote Calmeta to the Marchioness of Mantua in 1502, in a\r\nletter enclosing Pistoia's verses, \"an invective against Sasso for\r\ncertain sonnets and epigrams which he printed at Bologna against our\r\nDuke Lodovico Sforza, and which some people say that I wrote. It was\r\nnever my habit to attack others, but if I had wasted a little ink in\r\ndefending so illustrious a prince, I hardly think I should deserve much\r\nblame.\"[26]\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of Beatrice there had been no theatre in Milan, but\r\nLodovico had done his best to encourage dramatic art. As early as 1484,\r\nhe had written to the Duke of Ferrara, asking him to lend him a\r\nBolognese actor, Albergati by name, who was also a skilled mechanic, to\r\ngive sacred representations during Holy Week in Milan. The presence of\r\nDuke Ercole's daughter naturally gave a fresh impulse to the growth of\r\ndramatic art, and after Lodovico's visit to Ferrara in 1493, a theatre\r\nwas erected in Milan. Courtiers and poets vied with each other in the\r\nproduction of plays and masques at each successive Christmas or\r\nCarnival. In 1493, Niccolo da Correggio wrote a pastoral entitled _Mopsa\r\ne Daphne_, which was performed at court that Carnival, and which he\r\nafterwards sent to Isabella, promising to explain its allegorical\r\nmeaning at their next meeting. Another time, Gaspare Visconti composed\r\nthe masque with the chorus of Turks, to which we have already alluded,\r\nfor representation before the duke and duchess. On one occasion a piece\r\ncalled _La Fatica_ was acted at the house of Antonio Maria Sanseverino,\r\nwhose wife, Margherita of Carpi, was the sister of Elizabeth Gonzaga's\r\nbeloved companion, Emilia Pia, and herself a learned and cultivated\r\nprincess. On another a representation described as _La Pazienza_ was\r\ngiven before the court, in honour of a visit which Cardinal Federigo\r\nSanseverino paid to Milan.\r\n\r\nMusic, as Calmeta tells us, was another art that flourished in an\r\nespecial manner at the Milanese court. Both Lodovico and his wife were\r\npassionately fond of music, and the delicious melodies that daily\r\nresounded through their palace halls were the theme alike of chronicler\r\nand poet. When first Lorenzo de Medici had sent Leonardo to his friend's\r\ncourt to charm the Moro's ears with the surpassing sweetness of his\r\nplaying, he had brought with him a well-known musician and maker of\r\ninstruments, Atalante Migliorotti, who stood high in Lodovico's favour,\r\nand spent much of his time at Milan. We find Isabella d'Este writing to\r\nher friend, Niccolo da Correggio, in 1493, begging him to procure her\r\nthe loan of a silver lyre, given him by Atalante, that she may learn to\r\nplay this instrument; and in the following year the marchioness herself\r\nstood godmother to the Florentine musician's infant daughter, who was\r\ncalled Isabella after her illustrious sponsor. And in 1492 we find\r\nLodovico writing to thank Francesco Gonzaga for allowing a certain\r\nNarcisso, who was in the Marquis of Mantua's service, to visit Milan,\r\nand saying what exquisite pleasure this singer's voice has afforded him.\r\nThe following summer, Isabella, in her turn, begged her sister to allow\r\nher favourite violinist, Jacopo di San Secondo, to spend a few weeks at\r\nMantua; and on the 7th of July Beatrice wrote to desire his return.\r\n\"Since you are back at Mantua, I think you will not want Jacopo di San\r\nSecondo much longer, and beg you to send him back to Pavia as soon as\r\npossible, since his music will be a pleasure to my husband, who is\r\nsuffering from a slight attack of fever.\" This Jacopo was a famous\r\nviolin-player of his day, who had settled at the Moro's court, and who\r\nafter Lodovico's fall left Milan for Rome, where he became the friend of\r\nRaphael and Castiglione, and is said to have served as model for the\r\nlaurel-crowned Apollo of the Parnassus, in the Vatican Stanze. Another\r\nof Beatrice's favourite singers was Angelo Testagrossa, a beautiful\r\nyouth who sang, we are told, like a seraph, and who, after the death of\r\nthis princess, accepted Isabella's pressing invitation to Mantua, where\r\nhe composed songs and gave her lessons on the lute. Testagrossa is said\r\nto have sung in the Spanish style, which was much in vogue at Milan,\r\nwhere a Spaniard named Pedro Maria was director of the palace concerts,\r\nand is frequently mentioned in Bellincioni's poems. The priest Franchino\r\nGaffuri, as already stated, occupied the first chair of music ever\r\nfounded in Italy. Besides this master's works on music, another treatise\r\non harmony, composed by a priest named Florentio, and dedicated to\r\nCardinal Ascanio Sforza, is preserved in the Trivulzian Library, with a\r\nfine miniature of Leonardo playing the lyre as frontispiece.\r\n\r\nBoth the Flemish priest Cordier, with the wonderful tenor voice, and the\r\naccomplished master Cristoforo Romano were, as we know, among the\r\nchosen singers who accompanied Beatrice on her travels. And there was\r\none more gifted artist, who, like Atalante Migliorotti, was both a\r\nskilled musician and a mechanic, and whose whole life was devoted to the\r\nconstruction of musical instruments of the choicest quality, Lorenzo\r\nGusnasco of Pavia. It was Lodovico Moro who first discovered the rare\r\ntalents of this \"master of organs,\" as he was styled by his\r\ncontemporaries, and it was for Beatrice's use that he began to make\r\nthose wonderful clavichords and lutes and viols that made his name\r\nfamous throughout Italy. In his hands the manufacture of musical\r\ninstruments was carried to the highest pitch of excellence. He grudged\r\nno labour and spared no pains to make his work perfect. The choicest\r\nebony and ivory, the most precious woods and delicate strings were\r\nsought out by him; the best scholars supplied him with Greek and Latin\r\nepigrams to be inscribed upon his organs and clavichords. In his opinion\r\nboth material and shape were of the utmost importance, because, as he\r\nwrote to Isabella d'Este, \"beauty of form is everything,\" \"_perche ne la\r\nforma sta il tuto_.\" The work of this gifted maker naturally acquired a\r\nrare value in the eyes of his contemporaries. Sabba da Castiglione and\r\nTeseo Albonese praise him as the man who, above all others, has learnt\r\nthe secret of combining lovely melodies with beauteous form, just as a\r\ndivine soul is enshrined in a fair body. Painters and scholars alike\r\ntook delight in Lorenzo's company. He was the intimate friend of\r\nGiovanni Bellini and Andrea Mantegna, of Pietro Bembo and Aldo Manuzio,\r\nof Leonardo and Isabella d'Este. It was in these festive days, in the\r\nCastello of Pavia, that Lorenzo da Pavia first met both the great\r\nFlorentine and the accomplished princess who set so high a store on his\r\nfriendship. For more than twenty years Isabella corresponded regularly\r\nwith this gifted artist, and employed him not only to make organs and\r\nlutes for her, but to buy antiques and cameos, Murano glass and\r\ntapestry, choice pictures and rare books. Whether she wished for a\r\n_fantasia_, or Holy Family from the hand of Gian Bellini, or a choice\r\nedition of Dante or Petrarch from the press of Aldo Manuzio, it was to\r\nMesser Lorenzo that the request was addressed. In 1494, the Pavian\r\nmaster moved to Venice, where he found it easier to procure materials\r\nfor his trade, and was able to carry on his work on a larger scale. By\r\nthis time his fame had spread far and wide through Italy. He made an\r\norgan for Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary, and another which he\r\nhimself took to Rome for Pope Leo X. But his relations with Duchess\r\nBeatrice were not interrupted by this change of abode. In that same year\r\nhe made her that clavichord which Isabella describes as the best and\r\nmost beautiful which she had ever seen, and which she never ceased to\r\ncovet until, after her sister's death and Lodovico's fall, she obtained\r\npossession of the precious instrument.\r\n\r\nIt was at Venice, in the early spring of 1500, that Leonardo da Vinci\r\nonce more met this master, whom he had formerly known so well at Pavia\r\nand Milan. There the two artists who had lived together for many years\r\nin the Moro's service conversed sadly of the terrible catastrophe which\r\nhad overwhelmed their old master in sudden and inevitable ruin, and\r\nmourned over the disastrous fate which had plunged the fair Milanese\r\ninto confusion and misery. Then, as they looked back on the happy days\r\nof their former life, and talked of their old companions, the painter\r\nbrought out a drawing which Lorenzo immediately recognized as the\r\nportrait of Isabella d'Este, the illustrious princess, who was proud to\r\ncall herself their friend.\r\n\r\n\"Leonardo,\" he wrote the next day to the Marchesana, \"is here in Venice,\r\nand has shown me a portrait of your Highness, which is as natural and\r\nlifelike as possible.\"[27] This drawing, which the princess describes in\r\na letter to the painter as being _ni carbone_ and not in colours, is now\r\none of the treasures of the Louvre, and has an inestimable value, both\r\nas the work of Leonardo and as a genuine portrait of the most brilliant\r\nlady of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Uzielli, _Ricerche_, i.: Renier, _Gaspare Visconti_.\r\n\r\n[25] _Gazette des B.

But, as she wrote to her husband,\r\nwho was then in Venice, it was quite impossible for her to start on her\r\njourney at this early date. In the first place, half of her household\r\nwas in bed, ladies and servants alike were suffering from a feverish\r\nepidemic which had attacked the whole court; and in the second place,\r\nmany preparations were necessary if she were to appear at Milan in state\r\nworthy of the Marquis of Mantua's wife. \"Of course, if you wish it,\" she\r\nadds proudly, \"I will set off alone, in my chemise, but this I think you\r\nwill hardly desire.\"\r\n\r\nSignor Lodovico's invitation, however, was gladly accepted, and Isabella\r\nmade every preparation to start by the middle of August. She sent to\r\nFerrara, urging her favourite goldsmith, as he loved her, to finish a\r\nnecklace of a hundred links by next week, and begging him to lend her\r\nsome more jewelled chains for the use of her courtiers and\r\nmaids-of-honour. And the same day she wrote to the Venetian merchant\r\nTaddeo Contarini, excusing herself for her delay in paying for some\r\njewels which she had lately bought, since her visit to Milan necessarily\r\nentailed heavy expenses. By the 10th of August she was able to start on\r\nher journey, and spent a night on the way at Canneto with her kinswoman,\r\nAntonia del Balzo, wife of Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of Bozzolo, who came to\r\nmeet her with two beautiful daughters. \"Messer Andrea Mantegna himself,\"\r\nexclaimed the marchioness, \"could not paint fairer maidens!\" On the\r\n12th, she reached Cremona, where Lodovico's cousin, Francesco Sforza,\r\nwas awaiting her, and a crowd of people hailed her arrival with\r\nenthusiasm. After spending a night in the Episcopal palace, she went on\r\nto Pizzighettone, where she discovered that her best hat had been\r\nforgotten, and sent a messenger back to Mantua with the key of her black\r\nchest, desiring one of her servants to look out her hat with the\r\njewelled feather and send it after her by a flying courier. On the 15th,\r\nthe Marchesana reached Pavia, where both the Duchesses of Milan and Bari\r\nrode out to meet her, and placing her between them, after many embraces,\r\nconducted her through the city. Here the two dukes and all the\r\nambassadors were awaiting her, and a troop of trumpeters and outriders\r\nescorted the party up to the castle gates. That evening she supped alone\r\nwith Beatrice, and the hours flew by in delightful intercourse. Both\r\nsisters were in the highest spirits, and Isabella anticipated the\r\ngreatest pleasure from her visit, only regretting that her husband had\r\nnot been able to accompany her.\r\n\r\n\"The only news here,\" she wrote next day to the marquis, \"is the\r\nelection of this new Pope, which fills every one with great joy, and is\r\nsaid to be entirely due to Monsignore Ascanio, who will, they say, be\r\nthe new Vice-Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, Innocent VIII. had breathed his last, and on the\r\n6th of August, the conclave met to elect a new Pope. Among the\r\ntwenty-three Cardinals of which the Sacred College then consisted, three\r\nwere prominent candidates for the papal tiara. First of all there was\r\nCardinal Roderigo Borgia, the oldest and wealthiest of the group, who\r\nheld the three most important archbishoprics in Spain, as well as\r\ninnumerable benefices in the rest of Christendom, and whose scandalous\r\nvices amid the general corruption of morals in Rome offered no bar to\r\nhis advancement to the chair of St. Peter. Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, the\r\nrich and powerful brother of Lodovico Moro, was the second candidate\r\nfor the tiara; while the third was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of\r\nS. Pietro in Vincula, whose well-known French sympathies, as well as the\r\ninfluential position which he had occupied in Rome under his uncle,\r\nSixtus IV., made him unpopular with most of his colleagues. When Ascanio\r\nSforza saw that he could not ensure his own election, he threw his whole\r\ninfluence on the side of Borgia, who lavished his gold and promises\r\nfreely among the other members of the Sacred College, with the result\r\nthat he was elected on the 11th of August, and proclaimed Pope under the\r\ntitle of Alexander VI. The secret Archives of the Vatican[28] give full\r\nparticulars of this election, which was obtained by the most flagrant\r\nsimony, and proved a prelude to the days of confusion and misery which\r\nFra Girolamo Savonarola, the Dominican of Florence, daily prophesied\r\nwere in store for the Church. Ascanio Sforza was the first to reap the\r\nreward of his base compliance. The new Pope loaded him with favours, and\r\nopenly acknowledged his indebtedness both to him and Lodovico, while at\r\nMilan the event was hailed with public rejoicings, and joy-bells and\r\nsolemn processions celebrated the accession of this pontiff, who was\r\ndestined to prove the most bitter enemy of the House of Sforza.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Lodovico,\" wrote the Ferrarese envoy, our old friend Giacomo\r\nTrotti, to his master, \"is in the highest spirits at the success of his\r\nbrother's efforts. Cardinal Ascanio is likely, people say, to administer\r\nall the papal estates, and will be every bit as much pope as if he sat\r\nin Alexander's chair.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella's letters to her husband give the same impression. On the 19th\r\nof August she wrote from Pavia--\r\n\r\n\"To-day I dined with Signor Lodovico and my sister in their rooms,\r\naccording to our usual habit of taking our meals together, sometimes in\r\nmy rooms, sometimes in theirs. After dinner he dismissed all the\r\ncompany, excepting the Duke and Duchess of Milan, myself, and my\r\ncompanions, whom Signor Lodovico invited to remain, and with his own\r\nlips he read aloud a letter from his ambassador in Rome, saying that His\r\nHighness had sent for him, and addressed him in the following terms:\r\n'Take note of my words. I acknowledge that I have been made pope by the\r\naction of Monsignore Ascanio, contrary to all expectations, and in a\r\ntruly miraculous manner. I mean to show myself the most grateful of\r\npopes. It is my pleasure that he should sit in my chair, and dispose of\r\nmy spiritual and temporal estate as if I were myself,' with many other\r\naffectionate words. Cardinal Ascanio has already received the first\r\nproofs of his gratitude, since, besides the vice-chancellorship, the\r\nPope has given him his own furnished house in Rome, as well as the city\r\nof Nepi, and many other things. And His Highness has already dined with\r\nhim in private.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this, Signor Lodovico read us a letter which the Pope had\r\nwritten with his own hand to Monsignore Ascanio, complaining that he had\r\nnot seen him for half a day, a period which seemed to him more like a\r\nthousand years, and begging him to come to him at once, since he had\r\nmany things of the utmost importance to settle with him. After\r\ndescribing this interview, the said Monsignore went on to tell how\r\nwarmly His Holiness spoke of Signor Lodovico, saying that he was\r\ndetermined to maintain the most cordial relations with His Highness, and\r\nprofit in all cases by his advice, and only wished that he were seated\r\nin his chair. All of this, my dear lord, affords the court here reason\r\nfor the greatest rejoicings, and I have expressed both in word and\r\ngesture the pleasure which your Highness and I take in these things,\r\nbecause of our close union with Signor Lodovico.\"\r\n\r\nThe marchioness goes on to describe a hunting-party, in which the whole\r\ncourt had taken part.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, about four o'clock, all of these lords and ladies rode out\r\nwith me to a place called S. Pirono, some four miles from Pavia, and had\r\nfine sport. White tents were erected in the meadows on the edge of the\r\nforest, and in the midst a _pergola_ of green boughs, under which the\r\nduchess and I took our places, the duke and others, whether on horseback\r\nor on foot, occupying other tents. One stag of the eight which were\r\nfound there, ran out of the wood, followed by eight of the Duke of\r\nBari's dogs. Messer Galeazzo galloped after it with a long spear, and\r\nkilled it before our eyes. To-morrow we dine at Belriguardo, and go on\r\nto supper at Vigevano, where we expect my father, who is to arrive on\r\nThursday.\"\r\n\r\nDuke Ercole had reached Pavia on the 4th of August, and had paid a\r\nvisit to the Certosa with his son-in-law, after which he returned to\r\nFerrara, where his presence was required, owing to urgent affairs of\r\nState connected with the Pope's death. Now he once more joined his\r\ndaughters, accompanied by his son Alfonso and a troop of actors and\r\npages skilled in singing and reciting poetry. Among them was young\r\nAriosto, the bard of the Orlando Furioso, who was to celebrate the\r\npraises of all the princely personages present at Pavia and Vigevano, in\r\nhis great poem, and who on this occasion probably met Leonardo for the\r\nfirst time. _Fêtes_ and hunting-parties now succeeded each other every\r\nday. Even the King of Naples' ambassadors went out hunting, and one of\r\nthem succeeded in wounding a wild boar. Isabella sent her husband\r\nwonderful accounts of the thrilling adventures and splendid sport which\r\nafforded the two sisters such unfeigned delight.\r\n\r\n\"To-day,\" she wrote on the 27th of August, \"we went out hunting in a\r\nbeautiful valley which seemed as if it were expressly created for the\r\nspectacle. All the stags were driven into the wooded valley of the\r\nTicino, and closed in on every side by the hunters, so that they were\r\nforced to swim the river and ascend the mountains, where the ladies\r\nwatched them from under the _pergola_ and green tents set up on the\r\nhillside. We could see every movement of the animals along the valley\r\nand up the mountain-side, where the dogs chased them across the river;\r\nbut only two climbed the hillside and ran far out of sight, so that we\r\ndid not see them killed, but Don Alfonso and Messer Galeazzo both gave\r\nthem chase, and succeeded in wounding them. Afterwards came a doe with\r\nits young one, which the dogs were not allowed to follow. Many wild\r\nboars and goats were found, but only one boar was killed before our\r\neyes, and one wild goat, which fell to my share. Last of all came a\r\nwolf, which made fine somersaults in the air as it ran past us, and\r\namused the whole company; but none of its arts availed the poor beast,\r\nwhich soon followed its comrades to the slaughter. And so, with much\r\nlaughter and merriment, we returned home, to end the day at supper, and\r\ngive the body a share in the recreations of the mind.\"[29]\r\n\r\nFour venison pasties were despatched to Mantua the next day as a\r\npresent to the marquis, whose absence from these expeditions his wife\r\nnever ceased to regret, and for whom, at least in these early years of\r\nher married life, she had a genuine affection.\r\n\r\n\"All of these days,\" she writes on the 22nd, \"I have been trying to\r\nwrite to Your Highness, but have never been able to find time, as I am\r\nalways in my sister's and Signor Lodovico's company. Now I have at\r\nlength snatched a moment, and hasten to pay you a visit in mind, since I\r\ncannot do so in person. For greater even than all the pleasures which I\r\nam enjoying here, is the satisfaction I receive when I hear that you are\r\nwell and happy.\" A week later she wrote again: \"It really seems an age\r\nsince I saw Your Highness, and, pleasant and delightful as it is here, I\r\nbegin to get a little tired of these scenes, but rejoice at the prospect\r\nof paying a visit to Genoa before long.\" And in an affectionate letter\r\nto her mother, she says that sometimes in the middle of the finest hunt\r\nshe remembers with a pang how long it is since she has seen her, and how\r\nfar away she is from Ferrara, and the thought throws a shadow over the\r\nbrightest sunshine and the gayest pastimes.\r\n\r\nAfter a succession of boar hunts at Novara and Mortara, Lodovico and\r\nBeatrice took their guests to Milan on the 15th of September, and\r\nIsabella entered the capital on horseback between the two young\r\nduchesses, while \"the old Duchess Bona,\" she tells her husband, \"and her\r\ndaughter Madonna Bianca, with many other ladies, were awaiting me in my\r\nrooms in the Castello, the same suite which Signor Lodovico occupied at\r\nthe time of his wedding.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke's mother still remained at court, and occupied rooms in the\r\nCastello, although she made no secret of her aversion for her powerful\r\nbrother-in-law, and was secretly intriguing against him with her nephew,\r\nCharles VIII. At her request the French king wrote a letter to Lodovico,\r\ndesiring him to give the duchess's mother leave to come to France for\r\nhis wife Anne of Brittany's confinement. But the Moro, fearing the\r\neffect of Bona's presence at the French court, courteously declined\r\nCharles's invitation, alleging as an excuse the fact that both Bona's\r\ndaughter-in-law, the Duchess Isabella, and her young sister-in-law, his\r\nown wife Beatrice, were expecting similar events early in the next\r\nyear, while her daughter Bianca was of marriageable age and needed her\r\nmother's protection. At Milan new pleasures awaited Isabella. Theatrical\r\nrepresentations in honour of Duke Ercole, were given by the Delle Torre\r\nfamily and other noble houses, and Isabella spent long days with her\r\nsister in the park and beautiful gardens of the Castello, among the\r\nroses and fountains which Lodovico loved. He was never tired of\r\nbeautifying and enlarging the grounds, which now extended three miles\r\nround the Castello, and sent to Mantua for a pair of swans to adorn the\r\nlake, saying how much he liked to watch the movements of these\r\nwhite-plumed birds upon the water. To his sister-in-law, as Isabella\r\nalways repeated in her letters, the Moro showed himself the kindest and\r\nmost generous of hosts, and was unwearied in providing for her\r\namusements and gratification.\r\n\r\n\"To-day,\" she writes on the evening after her arrival at Milan, \"Signor\r\nLodovico showed me the treasure, which Your Highness saw when you were\r\nlast here, but which has lately received the addition of two large\r\nchests full of ducats, and another full of gold quartz about two and a\r\nhalf feet square. Would to God that we, who are so fond of spending\r\nmoney, possessed as much!\"[30]\r\n\r\nAfter which characteristic expression, the Marchesana proceeds to tell\r\nher lord that the date of her departure for Genoa has been fixed for the\r\nlast day of September, and to describe her brother-in-law's preparations\r\nfor the visit. Before her departure, he made a splendid present, which\r\nshe describes in a letter written on the 20th of September. \"Yesterday\r\nSignor Lodovico sent me, with the Duchess of Milan and Bari, to look at\r\nsome sumptuous brocades which he had seen in the house of one of the\r\nrichest merchants here. When we came home, he asked me which I\r\nconsidered the finest. I replied that what I had most admired was a\r\ncertain gold and silver tissue embroidered with the twin towers of the\r\nlighthouse in the port of Genoa, bearing the Spanish motto, _Tal\r\ntrabalio mes plases par tal thesauros non perder_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Moro praised her good taste, saying that he had already had a\r\n_camora_, or robe, made for his wife of this material, and begged her\r\nto accept fifteen yards of the same stuff, and wear it for his sake.\r\n\r\n\"This brocade,\" wrote Isabella joyfully to her husband, \"is worth at\r\nleast forty ducats a yard!\" And without delay she sent for a tailor to\r\ncut out the gown, in order that she might wear it once before she left\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesino Stanga and Count Girolamo Tuttavilla were chosen to\r\nescort Isabella to Genoa, where she was received in state by the\r\ngovernor Adorno, and splendidly entertained at the Casa Spinola by the\r\nchief citizens. Beatrice's delicate state of health had prevented her\r\nfrom accompanying her sister on this journey, but she still persisted in\r\ntaking long hunting expeditions, and one day when she and the Moro were\r\nstaying at Cuzzago, encountered a savage boar which had already wounded\r\nseveral greyhounds.\r\n\r\n\"My wife,\" wrote the Moro to his sister-in-law, \"came suddenly face to\r\nface with this furious beast, and herself gave it the first wound, after\r\nwhich Messer Galeazzo and I followed suit, so that the boar must have\r\nhad great pleasure in feeling how much trouble it had given us and to\r\nwhat dangers its hunters had been exposed.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this long and fatiguing hunting expedition was that\r\nBeatrice fell seriously ill. Lodovico was much alarmed, and sent daily\r\nbulletins both to his sister-in-law and to her mother at Ferrara. \"There\r\nis no fresh news to give you here,\" he wrote on the 6th of October. \"My\r\nwhole days are spent at the bedside of my dear wife, endeavouring to\r\ndistract her thoughts and amuse her mind as best I can during her\r\nillness.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella, who had intended to return home from Genoa, hurried back to\r\nMilan at the news of her sister's illness, and did not leave her until\r\nshe was convalescent. During these weeks Lodovico showed himself the\r\nmost devoted and attentive of husbands, and his letters to Isabella are\r\nfull of the practical jokes and witty dialogues and repartees with which\r\nhe and Messer Galeazzo amused the duchess. The following letter affords\r\na characteristic specimen of the kind of fooling which these great\r\nRenaissance lords and ladies carried on at the expense of the\r\nhalf-witted jesters and buffoons who were attached to their different\r\nhouseholds:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SISTER AND MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCELLENT LADY,\r\n\r\n\"You know what good sport we had in the wild boar-hunts at which you\r\nwere present this last summer. Poor Mariolo, you remember, could not be\r\nthere, first because he was ill at Milan, and afterwards because he was\r\nrequired to keep my wife company during her illness, and was much\r\ndistressed to have been absent from these expeditions, when he heard\r\nthat even the king's ambassadors had wounded a wild boar. And he told us\r\nall what great things he would have done, had he only been present. Now\r\nthat my dearest wife is better, and begins to be able to go out-of-doors\r\nagain, I thought we would have a little fun at his expense. Some wolves\r\nand wild goats having been driven into a wood near La Pecorara, which,\r\nas you know, is about a mile from here, on the way to La Sforzesca,\r\nCardinal Sanseverino had a common farm pig shut up in the same\r\nenclosure, and the next day we went out hunting, and took Mariolo with\r\nus. While we hunted the wolves and wild goats, we left the pig to him,\r\nand he, taking it for a wild boar, chased it with a great hue and cry\r\nalong the woods. If your Highness could only have seen him running after\r\nthis pig, you would have died of laughter, the more so that he gallantly\r\ntried to spear it three times over, and only succeeded in touching its\r\nside once. And seeing how proud he was of his prowess, we said to him,\r\n'Don't you know, Mariolo, that you have been hunting a tame pig?' He\r\nstood dumb with astonishment, and stared as if he did not know what we\r\ncould mean, and so we all came home infinitely amused, and every one\r\nasked Mariolo if he did not know the difference between a wild boar and\r\na tame pig!\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your brother,\r\n                                           LODOVICO MARIA SFORTIA.[31]\r\n\r\nVigevano, December 6, 1492.\"\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable thing about these letters is that a prince who was\r\nengaged in so much and varied business, who himself conducted a vast\r\ncorrespondence in which the most intricate diplomatic questions of the\r\nday were involved with his envoys at the different European courts, and\r\npersonally superintended every detail of administration, while at the\r\nsame time he gave minute instructions to the hundreds of architects,\r\nsculptors, and painters in his service, should have found time to write\r\nthese bantering epistles to his sister-in-law. One of these letters, for\r\ninstance, is devoted to a long account of the jokes that passed between\r\nMesser Galeazzo and the duchess at table, how Messer Galeazzo begged to\r\nbe allowed a taste of the duchess's soup, and complained that he was\r\nforgotten now that the Marchesana was no longer there, and how Beatrice\r\ntold him she would write and tell her sister, to which he replied, \"Tell\r\nher whatever you like, as long as I get my soup!\"\r\n\r\nYet at this very moment, when he penned these joking letters to\r\nIsabella, Lodovico was engaged in some of the most difficult and anxious\r\nnegotiations with other States.\r\n\r\nDuring Ercole d'Este's visit, the question of sending the customary\r\ncongratulations to the new Pope had been discussed, and Lodovico had\r\nsuggested that the ambassadors of the four allied powers--Milan, Naples,\r\nFlorence, and Ferrara--should send a joint deputation, both as a mark of\r\nspecial honour to His Holiness, and as a public manifesto to foreign\r\npowers of the strength of these united States. The step, he was\r\nconfident, would produce a good effect both on the King of the Romans\r\nand Charles VIII. of France, whose designs on Italy were already\r\nexciting alarm. Both the Duke of Ferrara and King Ferrante, who had been\r\nconsulted through his ambassadors, when they came to hunt at Vigevano,\r\nagreed readily to Lodovico's proposal, and the only person to raise\r\nobjections was Piero de' Medici, who had lately succeeded his father as\r\nchief magistrate of Florence, and pretended to the same power. The death\r\nof his friend Lorenzo had been sincerely deplored by Lodovico, who,\r\nbefore many months had passed, began to discover how weak and\r\ncontemptible a character his son possessed, and had already consulted\r\nhis astrologer as to the influence which this young man would have upon\r\nhis own fortunes. Now the vain and foolish youth refused to join in the\r\nproposed embassy to the Vatican, because he wished to appear alone\r\nbefore Alexander VI. and impress that new Pope by the magnificence of\r\nhis apparel and retinue. Not content with frustrating the Moro's plan,\r\nPiero induced King Ferrante to withdraw his consent to the joint\r\ndeputation, a step which did not tend to improve the strained relations\r\nthat had existed for some time past between Naples and Milan. Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere had retired to Ostia in disgust at the election of\r\nthe Borgia Pope, leaving Ascanio Sforza all powerful at the Vatican, and\r\nthe Pope availed himself of every occasion to show his friendship for\r\nLodovico. Already a marriage had been proposed between Alexander's\r\ndaughter Lucrezia Borgia and Giovanni Sforza, Prince of Pesaro, and the\r\nKing of Naples looked with alarm on the friendly relations that existed\r\nbetween the Holy See and Milan. \"Alexander VI.,\" said Ferrante,\r\nbitterly, \"has no respect for the Holy Church, and cares for nothing but\r\nthe aggrandisement of his own family. Rome will soon become a Milanese\r\ncamp.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Lodovico Sforza looked with suspicion on the intrigues of\r\nFerrante's son Alfonso, and was anxious to strengthen his alliance with\r\nother powers, he had as yet no thought of inviting the French to invade\r\nItaly. On the contrary, the whole tenor of his private letters and\r\npublic despatches was marked by the same anxiety to maintain cordial\r\nrelations with the different Italian states, in order that they might\r\npresent a united front to foreign enemies. However friendly were his\r\nadvances to the King of France, he had never by word or hint given him\r\nthe slightest encouragement to invade Italy or assert his claim to the\r\ncrown of Naples. It was only when he saw peace restored between Charles\r\nand Maximilian, on the one hand, and on the other a treaty of alliance\r\nconcluded between the Pope and the King of Naples, that he began to\r\ntremble for his own safety, and suddenly changed his policy. But for the\r\nmoment counsels of peace prevailed, and the ambitious Moro could look\r\nforward with hope and confidence to the coming year, that promised to\r\nbring him new joys, and perchance the fulfilment of his long-cherished\r\ndesire, in the birth of a son and heir.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] Pastor's \"History of the Popes,\" vol. v. p. 383, etc.\r\n\r\n[29] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 350, etc.\r\n\r\n[30] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 356.\r\n\r\n[31] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 361.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nBirth of Beatrice's first-born son--The Duchess of Ferrara at\r\nMilan--_Fêtes_ and rejoicings at court and in the Castello--The court\r\nmoves to Vigevano--Beatrice's wardrobe--Her son's portrait--Letters to\r\nher mother and sister--Lodovico's plans for a visit to Ferrara and\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\n1493\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January, at four o'clock on a winter's afternoon,\r\nBeatrice gave birth to a son in the Rocchetta of the castle of Milan.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Lodovico's joy at the birth of his first-born son is beyond all\r\ndescription,\" wrote Giacomo Trotti to his master, Duke Ercole. Duchess\r\nLeonora was present on the occasion, and herself announced the happy\r\nevent in a letter to her daughter Isabella, who promptly sent a special\r\nenvoy with her congratulations to the Duke of Bari and her sister. A\r\nfortnight before, Leonora had set out for Pavia, where Trotti had been\r\nsent to meet her, and crowds shouting _Moro! Moro!_ had everywhere\r\nhailed her arrival. Three days later, she reached Milan in time to make\r\nthe last preparations before the birth of her grandson. The child, a\r\nfine healthy boy, received the name of Ercole, in compliment to his\r\ngrandfather, the Duke of Ferrara, but was afterwards called Maximilian,\r\nwhen the emperor became his godfather after his marriage to Bianca\r\nSforza. The auspicious event was hailed with public rejoicings. The\r\nbells rang for six days, and solemn processions were held, and\r\nthanksgivings offered up in all the churches and abbeys of the Milanese.\r\nPrisoners for debt were released, and the advent of the new-born prince\r\nwas celebrated with as great honour as if his father had been the\r\nreigning duke. Already some of the courtiers attached to Giangaleazzo's\r\nhousehold began to whisper that the birth of Francesco, the little Count\r\nof Pavia, two years before, had been celebrated with far less pomp. But\r\nin the same week Duchess Isabella, who was residing in the _Corte\r\nducale_ of the Castello, gave birth to a daughter, who received the name\r\nof Bona, so that, as Lodovico informed the foreign ambassadors, there\r\nwas double cause for rejoicings.\r\n\r\nFull and elaborate details of the ceremonies observed on this occasion,\r\nand of the splendid _fêtes_ that attended the recovery of the two\r\nduchesses, were sent to Isabella d'Este at Mantua by her mother's maid\r\nof honour, Teodora degli Angeli. Every particular of the decorations in\r\nthe rooms of the Castello, the colour of the hangings and the draperies\r\nof the cradle, the gowns worn by the different princesses at their\r\nsuccessive appearances in public, was faithfully reported for Isabella's\r\nbenefit. On the eve of the young prince's birth, the sumptuous cradle\r\nand layette prepared for his reception were shown to the Ambassadors,\r\nchief magistrates, and nobles of Milan, and displayed on tables covered\r\nwith gold and crimson brocade, lined with Spanish cat, in the Sala del\r\nTesoro, adjoining Beatrice's rooms. All through the next fortnight\r\ncostly gifts for the young duchess and her new-born babe were received\r\nfrom the magistrates of Milan and the chief towns of the duchy, and\r\nprincipal courtiers. On Sunday, the 4th of February, the ambassadors,\r\ncouncillors, magistrates and court officials, together with many noble\r\nMilanese ladies, were invited to present their congratulations to\r\nBeatrice, and that evening the gifts presented to her were publicly\r\ndisplayed in the Sala del Tesoro. The doors of the shelves along the\r\nwalls were thrown open, and the splendid gold and silver plate, the\r\nmassive jars, bowls, vases, and dishes, which they contained, were\r\nranged in tiers on a stand, protected by iron bars and guarded by two\r\nmen-at-arms wearing ducal liveries. The seneschal of Lodovico's\r\nhousehold, Ambrogio da Corte, received the guests at the doors of the\r\nRocchetta, paying each of them the honours due to his rank, and\r\nconducted them to the Sala del Tesoro. There they were received by\r\nstewards clad in silver brocade, who led them through a suite of rooms\r\nadorned with gilded columns and hung with white damask curtains richly\r\nembroidered with equestrian figures and other Sforzesque devices, into\r\nthe presence of the duchess. This chamber was still more richly\r\ndecorated than the others. \"Indeed, it is calculated,\" writes the\r\nadmiring maid of honour, \"that the tapestries and hangings here are\r\nworth 70,000 ducats.\" Two pages guarded the doors, and within, near the\r\nfireplace, Duchess Leonora sat at her daughter's bedside, accompanied by\r\ntwo or three ladies. Beatrice's own couch was gorgeously adorned with\r\ndraperies of mulberry colour and gold, and a crimson canopy bearing the\r\nnames of Lodovico and Beatrice in massive gold, with red and white\r\nrosettes and a fringe of golden balls which alone was valued at 8000\r\nducats.\r\n\r\n\"All,\" exclaimed Teodora--\"_bello e galante_, beyond words!\"[32]\r\n\r\nAfter paying their respects to the illustrious mother, the guests passed\r\non into the room of the new-born child--_la camera del Puttino_. Here\r\nthe walls were hung with brocades of the Sforza colours, red, white, and\r\nblue, and tapestries, embroidered with all manner of beasts and birds\r\nand fantastic designs. But the golden cradle itself, which had been made\r\nin Milan, was the most beautiful thing of all, with its four slender\r\ncolumns and pale blue silk canopy enriched with gold cords and fringes.\r\n\"Truly rich and elegant beyond anything that I have ever seen!\" writes\r\nthe ecstatic maid of honour, whose eyes were fairly dazzled by the sight\r\nof all these splendours, and who, as she told Isabella, was lost in\r\nwonder and admiration at the magnificence of the Milanese court. After a\r\nglimpse of the royal infant, sleeping under his coverlid of cloth of\r\ngold, watched over by Beatrice's ladies, the visitors were conducted\r\ninto Signor Lodovico's hall of audience, where he received the\r\nambassadors and chief councillors, and through the adjoining room,\r\noccupied by his favourite astrologer, Messer Ambrogio da\r\nRosate--\"without whom nothing can be done here,\" remarks Teodora--back\r\nto the entrance hall, where the seneschal was in waiting to escort them\r\nto the gates.\r\n\r\nMesser Ambrogio, as Teodora opined, had to be consulted before the\r\nduchess was allowed to leave her bed. This was on Wednesday, the 24th of\r\nFebruary, on which day both the royal ladies issued from their rooms at\r\nthe same hour. \"Now at length,\" wrote the lively maid of honour to\r\nIsabella, \"I am able to inform your Highness that the illustrious\r\nMadonna your sister has left her room, and those poor tormented souls\r\nwhose task it has been for so many nights to bring in shawls to spread\r\nover the presents, are at last freed from their labours.\"\r\n\r\nThat same day, both the young duchesses went in state to S. Maria delle\r\nGrazie, to return thanks and praise to God for the birth of their\r\nchildren. The royal ladies rode in the Duchess of Ferrara's chariot, a\r\nsumptuous carriage hung with purple, and were accompanied by Leonora\r\nherself and five other Sforza princesses--Alfonso d'Este's wife, Anna;\r\nDuke Giangaleazzo's sister, Bianca Sforza; Signor Lodovico's daughter,\r\nBianca, the youthful bride of Galeazzo Sanseverino; Madonna\r\nBeatrice--Niccolo da Correggio's mother--and Madonna Camilla Sforza of\r\nPesaro. The toilettes worn on this occasion were exceptionally rich, as\r\nTeodora relates. \"Our Madonna, Duchess Leonora, wore black, as usual,\r\nbut was very gallantly adorned with her finest jewels. The Duchess of\r\nBari had a lovely vest of gold brocade worked in red and blue silk, and\r\na blue silk mantle trimmed with long-haired fur, and her hair coiled as\r\nusual in a silken net. Duchess Isabella wore gold brocade and green\r\nvelvet enriched with crimson cords and silver thread, and a mantle of\r\ncrimson velvet lined with grey silk. Both ladies were covered with\r\njewels. Madonna Anna's _camora_ was of cloth-of-gold with crimson\r\nsleeves, lined with fur and edged with gold fringe. One fine invention\r\nwhich I noticed was a new trimming made of grey lamb's wool, but there\r\nwas no end to the variety of colours and fringes or to the beauty of the\r\njewels.\"\r\n\r\nAfter hearing a solemn Te Deum and other canticles very beautifully sung\r\nby the choir of the ducal chapel, the whole party drove to the house of\r\nCount Della Torre, who entertained the dukes and duchesses, ambassadors\r\nand councillors, and all the chief gentlemen and ladies of the court at\r\na splendid banquet. On the following day the duchesses and princesses\r\nwere entertained at a feast given by Niccolo's mother, Madonna Beatrice,\r\nin her rooms in the Castello, and appeared in fresh costumes and still\r\nmore splendid jewels. On Friday no _fête_ was given, but most of the\r\nyouthful princes and princesses went out hunting in the park, and three\r\nstags were killed in the course of the day. Beatrice appeared in a\r\nriding-habit of rose-tinted cloth, and a large jewel instead of a\r\nfeather in her silk hat, and rode on a black horse. Madonna Anna wore\r\nblack and gold, with a pearl-embroidered crimson hat, and her sister\r\nBianca also appeared on horseback, while Duchess Leonora spent the day\r\nwith old Duchess Bona in her rooms.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday a _fête_ was given at the house of Gaspare di Pusterla.\r\nBeatrice looked particularly charming with a feather of rubies in her\r\nhair, and a crimson satin robe embroidered with a pattern of knots and\r\ncompasses and many ribbons, \"after her favourite fashion,\" adds Teodora.\r\nIt is these very ribbons that we still see to-day, both in the few\r\nportraits that we have of the short-lived duchess, and in the marble\r\neffigy upon her tomb. Isabella of Aragon appeared on this occasion, in a\r\ngown embroidered with books and letters, a favourite device of\r\nRenaissance ladies; while Anna Sforza was all in white, \"because it was\r\nSaturday,\" explained Teodora, and she had vowed to wear no colours on\r\nthat day for a certain number of weeks. This was a common practice with\r\nmany Italian princesses who had lately recovered from illness or given\r\nbirth to a child, and one to which we find frequent allusion in the\r\ncorrespondence of Isabella d'Este. On Saturday all the court attended\r\nhigh mass at S. Maria delle Grazie, and a last entertainment was given,\r\nthis time by Duchess Beatrice herself, in the Rocchetta.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Lodovico took his wife and mother-in-law, with the Duchess\r\nof Milan and their other guests, to Vigevano, to enjoy a little rest and\r\ncountry air. But here fresh amusements awaited them, and the splendour\r\nof Beatrice's wardrobe and the treasures of her _camerini_ filled the\r\nFerrarese visitors with wonder and envy. On the 6th of March, Bernardo\r\nProsperi wrote to tell Isabella that our Madonna had been conducted by\r\nthe jester Mariolo over Beatrice's \"_guardaroba_,\" and had seen all the\r\nsplendid gowns, pelisses, and mantles which had been made for her during\r\nthe last two years, about eighty-four in all, \"besides many more,\" adds\r\nthe writer, \"which your sister the duchess has in Milan.\" The costliness\r\nof the materials, and the rich and intricate embroidery which covered\r\nsatins and brocades, made Leonora exclaim that she felt as if she were\r\nin a sacristy looking at priests' vestments and altar frontals. After\r\nexamining all of these fine clothes, the duchess was taken into two\r\nother _camerini_, where Beatrice, after the fashion of great ladies in\r\nthose days, had collected her favourite books and _object d'art_. One\r\ncabinet was full of Murano glass of delicate shape and colour, of\r\nporcelain dishes, and majolica from Faenza or Gubbio. Another held\r\nivories, crystals, and enamels engraved in the same style as Lodovico's\r\nvases in the treasury at Milan. Perfumes and washes filled another case,\r\nwhile a separate cabinet was devoted to hunting implements, dog-collars,\r\npouches, flasks, horns, knives, and hoods for falcons. \"There was,\r\nindeed,\" added Duchess Leonora's attendant, \"enough to fill many shops.\"\r\n\r\nThe evenings at Vigevano were enlivened with music and singing, and, by\r\nLodovico's orders, a band of Spanish musicians who had been sent from\r\nRome to Milan by his brother, Cardinal Ascanio, came to play before\r\nBeatrice and her mother, who both admired the sweet strains of their\r\nlarge viols, and examined the shape and size of their instruments with\r\ncuriosity. On Sunday theatrical representations were given, and Beatrice\r\nappeared in a wonderful new gown made of gold-striped cloth, with a\r\ncrimson vest laced with fine silver thread \"arranged,\" wrote an admiring\r\nlady-in-waiting, \"in the most graceful fashion. This your sister wore,\"\r\nshe adds, \"because it was Carnival Sunday; but even now, although Lent\r\nhas begun for most of us, Carnival is not yet over for these highnesses,\r\nsince Signor Lodovico and his duchess, Messer Galeazzo, the Duke and\r\nDuchess of Milan, and many of their courtiers, have received\r\ndispensations from Rome to eat meat all the same.\"[33]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Beatrice's little son was growing into a strong healthy child,\r\nand her letters are full of the beauty and perfections of her precious\r\nbabe. Again and again, in her notes to Isabella, she talks of \"my son\r\nErcole,\" with all a young mother's proud delight.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you,\" she writes to her sister, \"how well Ercole is\r\nlooking, and how big and plump he has grown lately. Each time I see him\r\nafter a few days' absence, I am amazed and delighted to see how much he\r\nhas grown and improved, and I often wish that you could be here to see\r\nhim, as I am quite sure you would never be able to stop petting and\r\nkissing him.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella, on her part, wrote warmly to her sister in return, saying how\r\nmuch she longed to see her beautiful boy--\"_il suo bello puttino_\" and\r\n\"not only to see him, but to hold him in my arms and enjoy his company\r\nafter my own fashion.\"\r\n\r\nDuchess Leonora returned to Ferrara at the end of another week, and one\r\nof Beatrice's first anxieties was to have a portrait of her child\r\npainted for her mother. On the 16th of April, she wrote from her\r\nfavourite country house Villa Nova, where she had brought the babe to\r\nenjoy the sweet spring air--\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST ILLUSTRIOUS MADAMA MINE, AND DEAREST MOTHER,\r\n\r\n\"Your Highness must forgive my delay in writing to you. The reason was\r\nthat every day I have been hoping the painter would bring me the\r\nportrait of Ercole, which my husband and I now send you by this post.\r\nAnd, I can assure you, he is much bigger than this picture makes him\r\nappear, for it is already more than a week since it was painted. But I\r\ndo not send the measure of his height, because people here tell me if I\r\nmeasure him he will never grow! Or else I certainly would let you have\r\nit. And my lord and I, both of us, commend ourselves to your Highness,\r\nand I kiss your hand, my dearest mother.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your obedient servant and child,\r\n                                             BEATRICE SFORTIA DA ESTE,\r\n                                               with _my own_ hand.[34]\r\n\r\nTo the most illustrious Lady my dearest Mother,\r\nSignora Duchessa di Ferrara.\"\r\n\r\nThe baby's portrait was forwarded to Mantua for Isabella's inspection,\r\ntogether with a letter from her mother, saying--\r\n\r\n\"I enclose a drawing which has been sent to us from Milan, to show how\r\nwell our grandson thrives, and certainly, if we have been already told\r\nhow flourishing he is, this gives us a living witness to his beauty and\r\nwell-being. And if you ask me whether the portrait is a good one, I need\r\nonly tell you who has sent it and who is the master who has done this\r\ndrawing, and then I am sure you will be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nLeonora's words excite our wonder as to who the artist could be whose\r\nname of itself would be enough to satisfy Isabella of the excellence of\r\nthe work. As Signor Luzio has already remarked,[35] it is impossible to\r\nread these words without thinking that Leonardo must have been the\r\nartist employed by Lodovico on this occasion to take a sketch of his\r\ninfant son. But the drawing of Ercole has vanished, and the painter's\r\nname remains unknown.\r\n\r\nAnother name which recurs frequently in Beatrice's letters to both her\r\nmother and sister at this time, is that of a Spanish embroiderer, named\r\nMaestro Jorba, noted for his rare skill, who was in the service of the\r\nDuchess of Ferrara, and was left by her at Vigevano in April, to design\r\nhangings and gowns for Lodovico's wife. On the 14th of March, Jorba was\r\nsent back to Ferrara with a letter from Beatrice to her mother,\r\nexpressing her satisfaction with his work; and in April, Leonora sent\r\nher a new design for a _camora_ which the clever Spaniard had invented.\r\n\r\n\"I have to-night,\" wrote Beatrice in reply, \"received the design of the\r\n_camora_ made by Jorba, which I admire very much, and have just shown it\r\nto my embroiderer, as your Highness advised. He remarks that the flowers\r\nof the pattern are all the same size, and since the _camora_ will\r\nnaturally be cut narrower above than below, the flowers ought to be\r\naltered in the same proportion. I have not yet decided what will be the\r\nbest thing to do, but thought I would tell you what Schavezi says, and\r\nwait to hear what you advise, and then do whatever you think best.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the same year, we find Maestro Jorba once more at Milan,\r\nworking for Duchess Beatrice, much to the annoyance of her sister\r\nIsabella, who was anxious to secure the services of the skilful\r\nembroiderer, and offered him a salary of two hundred ducats a year if he\r\nwould settle at Mantua. Jorba, however, seems to have preferred to\r\nremain at Ferrara, and only paid occasional visits to the princesses of\r\nEste at Milan and Mantua.\r\n\r\nThroughout April, all the tailors and embroiderers, goldsmiths and\r\njewellers, in Beatrice's service were busy making preparations for a\r\nvisit which their mistress was shortly to pay to her old home. Before\r\nLeonora left Vigevano the Moro had promised to bring his wife and child\r\nto Ferrara in May, and had decided to send Beatrice to Venice, with her\r\nmother Duchess Leonora, who was going to spend a few days with her son\r\nAlfonso and his wife, at the palace of the Estes on the Canal Grande. He\r\nhad further intimated his intention of paying a visit to his\r\nsister-in-law at Mantua on the way. Isabella, who had just accepted an\r\ninvitation from the Doge, Agostino Barbarigo, to visit Venice for the\r\nFeast of the Ascension, was somewhat dismayed when the news reached her,\r\nand looked forward with no little alarm to the prospect of entertaining\r\nher splendid brother-in-law. She wrote off without delay to consult her\r\nhusband on the subject--\r\n\r\n\"Madama sends me word that Signor Lodovico has decided to visit Ferrara\r\nin May, and gives me the list of the company who are to attend him,\r\nwhich I enclose for you to see. For my part I can hardly believe it, but\r\nshall be sorry if I am at Venice when such _fêtes_ are being held at\r\nFerrara. Your Highness must decide what you think is best for the honour\r\nof our house, since when I was at Milan Signor Lodovico told me that if\r\nhe came to Ferrara he would visit Mantua on the way. No doubt you will\r\ndo what seems to be most prudent, and will let me know your wishes. But\r\nperhaps I may be mistaken.[36]\r\n\r\n\"Mantua, 9th of April, 1493.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella was still more disturbed when she heard that Lodovico intended\r\nto send his wife to Venice. Her pride shrank from the bare notion of\r\nappearing before the Doge and Senate at the same time as her sister,\r\nwhose sumptuous apparel and numerous suite she felt herself unable to\r\nrival. \"Nothing in the world,\" she wrote to Gianfrancesco, who was then\r\nat Venice as captain-general of the Republic's forces, \"will induce me\r\nto go to Venice at the same time as my sister the duchess.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she insisted on her desire to appear before the Doge, not as a guest\r\nand foreign visitor, but as a daughter and servant, begging that she\r\nmight be treated without any pomp or ceremony.\r\n\r\nFortunately, whether from political motives, or from his usual\r\nattention to his astrologer's advice, Lodovico deferred his visit to\r\nFerrara until the middle of May, and himself wrote a courteous letter to\r\nIsabella, expressing his regret that he would after all be unable to\r\naccept her invitation to Mantua, since he found himself obliged to visit\r\nParma. The marchioness, thus happily relieved from her fears, set off\r\nfor Ferrara on the 4th of May, and proceeded to Venice a week later,\r\nhaving doubled the number of her retinue, and strained every nerve to\r\npresent an appearance which should not offer too marked a contrast with\r\nBeatrice's regal splendours.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] L.

Up to that time the Moro seems to have been content to govern in\r\nhis nephew's name, and had rejected with horror King Ferrante's\r\nsuggestion that he should depose Gian Galeazzo as incapable, and reign\r\nin his stead. But whether it was that Beatrice in her turn had become\r\nambitious to bear the title of Duchess of Milan and see her son\r\nrecognized as heir to the crown, or whether the birth of his son stirred\r\nup new desires in her lord's breast, it is certain that the spring of\r\n1493 was a turning-point in Lodovico's career. From this time he began\r\nto aim at reigning in his nephew's stead, and applied himself in good\r\nearnest to obtain legal recognition of his title. In the first place,\r\nthe birth of Ercole, and the extraordinary honours paid to the child and\r\nhis mother on this occasion, had the effect of exasperating Isabella of\r\nAragon, and exciting new and bitter rivalry between herself and\r\nBeatrice. Gian Galeazzo, sunk in idle pleasures and debauchery, had long\r\nceased to take any interest in the government of Milan, or to show the\r\nleast wish to assert himself. He was recognized on all hands as\r\naltogether unfit to rule--in the words of the historian Guicciardini,\r\n\"_incapacissimo_.\" But with his wife it was different. In public she\r\ncontrolled her rage and appeared with her cousin at _fêtes_ and state\r\nceremonies, but in private she wept bitter tears. Already her father,\r\nAlfonso, Duke of Calabria, had begged his sister Duchess Leonora and her\r\nhusband to try and induce Lodovico to restore the Duke and Duchess of\r\nMilan to their rightful position, and the good duchess, who was on\r\nfriendly terms with Bona of Savoy and with her own niece, Isabella of\r\nAragon, did all in her power to soften the rivalry between the two young\r\nprincesses. But after her departure from Milan, Isabella's ill-concealed\r\nanger broke out, and, according to Corio, she wrote the memorable Latin\r\nletter to her father.\r\n\r\n\"It was then,\" writes the Milanese chronicler, \"that the duchess, being\r\na princess of great spirit, refused to endure the humiliations to which\r\nshe and her husband were exposed, and wrote to Alfonso her father, after\r\nthis manner: 'Many years have passed, my father, since you first wedded\r\nme to Gian Galeazzo, on the understanding that he would in due time\r\nsucceed to the sceptre of his father and ascend the throne of Galeazzo\r\nand Francesco Sforza and of his Visconti ancestors. He is now of age and\r\nis himself a father; but he is not yet in possession of his dominions,\r\nand can only obtain the actual necessaries of life from the hands of\r\nLodovico and his ministers. It is Lodovico who administers the state,\r\ntreats of war and peace, confirms the laws, grants privileges, imposes\r\ntaxes, hears petitions, and raises money. Everything is in his power,\r\nwhile we are left without friends or money, and are reduced to live as\r\nprivate persons. Not Gian Galeazzo, but Lodovico, is recognized as lord\r\nof the kingdom. He places prefects in the castles, raises military\r\nforces, appoints magistrates, and discharges all the duties of a prince.\r\nHe is, in fact, the true duke. His wife has lately borne him a son, who\r\nevery one prophesies will soon be called Count of Pavia, and will\r\nsucceed to the dukedom, and royal honours were paid him at his birth,\r\nwhile we and our children are treated with contempt, and it is not\r\nwithout risk to our lives that we remain under the roof of the palace,\r\nfrom which he would remove us in his envious hatred, leaving me widowed\r\nand desolate, destitute of help and friends. But I have still spirit and\r\ncourage of my own; the people regard us with compassion, and look upon\r\nhim with hatred and curses, because he has robbed them of their gold to\r\nsatisfy his greed. I am not able to contend with men, and am forced to\r\nsuffer every kind of humiliation. There is no one here to whom I can\r\nspeak, for even our servants are given us by him. But if you have any\r\nfatherly compassion, if a spark of royal or noble feeling still lives in\r\nyour heart, if love of me and the sight of my tears can move your soul,\r\nI implore you to come to our help, and deliver your daughter and\r\nson-in-law from the fear of slavery, and restore them once more to their\r\nrightful kingdom. But if you will not help us, I would rather die by my\r\nown hands than bear the yoke of strangers, which would be a still\r\ngreater evil than to allow a rival to reign in my place.'\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was probably composed by the historian, but there is no\r\ndoubt that it reproduces the wronged duchess's sentiments, and that\r\nCorio does not exaggerate the effect which his daughter's indignant\r\nappeal produced upon Alfonso. \"Shall we suffer our own blood to be\r\ndespised?\" he is said to have exclaimed, when he called upon his father\r\nto avenge his daughter's wrong, and at the same time pointed out how\r\nfraught with danger to the realm of Naples was the existence of so\r\npowerful and independent a prince as Lodovico. But the old king\r\npreferred to have recourse to his usual expedients of cunning and\r\nintrigue, and while he employed every artifice to undermine Lodovico's\r\ninfluence both at the other courts of Italy and in France, he sent\r\nambassadors to congratulate the Moro on his son's birth, and only\r\nexpostulated in a friendly manner with his kinsman. Lodovico himself,\r\nhowever, was too astute not to see the dangers which threatened him, and\r\nhe became doubly anxious to form a close alliance with the Pope, and\r\nwith his old enemies the Signory of Venice. Early in 1493, Alexander\r\nVI., now Lodovico Sforza's firm friend, proposed a new alliance between\r\nhimself, Milan, and Venice to the Doge and Senate, and Count Caiazzo was\r\nsent by Lodovico to negotiate the terms of the treaty, which was to hold\r\ngood for twenty-five years, and had for its express object the\r\nmaintenance of the peace of Italy. Ferrara and Mantua both joined the\r\nnew league, which was solemnly proclaimed at Venice on St. Mark's day,\r\nwhen, after high mass, the Doge conferred the honour of knighthood on\r\nTaddeo Vimercati, the Milanese ambassador, and the banners of Milan and\r\nof the Pope were borne in procession round the Piazza.\r\n\r\nIn order to confirm the alliance, Lodovico not only agreed to visit\r\nFerrara in May, but also decided to send his wife at the head of an\r\nembassy to Venice, as a proof of his friendship for his new allies. Four\r\nexperienced councillors, Count Girolamo Tuttavilla, Galeazzo Visconti,\r\nAngelo Talenti, and Pietro Landriano, were chosen to accompany her, and\r\nan elaborate paper of secret directions was drawn up by Lodovico\r\nhimself, dated the 10th of May. On the same day a still more important\r\npaper of instructions was delivered by the Moro to Erasmo Brasca, the\r\nenvoy whom he sent that week to Germany. This agent was instructed to\r\nlay two proposals before Maximilian, King of the Romans. In the first\r\nplace, he was to offer him the hand of Bianca Maria Sforza, the Duke of\r\nMilan's sister, with the enormous dowry of 400,000 ducats. In the\r\nsecond, he was to ask Maximilian, on Lodovico's behalf, for a renewal of\r\nthe investiture of Milan, formerly granted to the Visconti dukes, but\r\nnever obtained by the three princes of the house of Sforza. As, on the\r\nextinction of the Visconti race, the fief ought to have returned to the\r\nempire, it was in the emperor's power to bestow the duchy upon Lodovico,\r\nwhose title would thus be rendered perfectly legal, while Gian Galeazzo\r\nwould become the usurper, he himself, his father, and grandfather having\r\nonly held the dukedom by right of a popular election, which had never\r\nbeen confirmed by the emperor. This, then, was the proposal which the\r\nMoro secretly made to Maximilian, whose father, the Emperor Frederic\r\nIII., was at the time still living, but was known to be in very failing\r\nhealth. The King of the Romans was by no means insensible to the\r\nadvantages of an alliance with the powerful Regent of Milan, or to the\r\nlarge dowry which Bianca Maria would bring with her to replenish his\r\nempty coffers. Some objections were raised by the German princes, who\r\nchose to consider this marriage with a Sforza princess beneath the\r\nimperial dignity, but Maximilian himself readily consented to all\r\nLodovico's conditions, and promised to grant him the investiture of the\r\nduchy of Milan as soon as he succeeded his father, only stipulating\r\nthat this part of the agreement should be kept secret for the present.\r\nThe royal bridegroom was to receive three hundred thousand ducats as\r\nBianca's dowry, while the remaining hundred thousand, which represented\r\nthe tribute dues on the investiture of the duchy, as an imperial fief,\r\nwere to be paid when this part of the transaction was accomplished.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maximilian had already entered into negotiations with Charles\r\nVIII., who, in his anxiety to undertake the expedition of Naples, was\r\nready to make any sacrifices in other directions; and on the 15th of May\r\nthe Treaty of Senlis was concluded between the two monarchs. Lodovico's\r\nambassador, Belgiojoso, accompanied the French king to Senlis, and kept\r\nhis master fully informed of all that happened at court. But while the\r\nMoro had repeatedly assured Charles of his friendly intentions, he had\r\nhitherto prudently abstained from offering any device as to the young\r\nking's warlike designs against Naples, and had, it was well known,\r\nopposed them. When in March, Charles VIII. had begged him, as a personal\r\nfavour, to send him his son-in-law, Galeazzo di Sanseverino, of whose\r\nknightly prowess he had heard so much, in order that he might confer\r\nwith this distinguished captain on military questions, Lodovico\r\nabsolutely refused to consent, fearing the suspicions which Messer\r\nGaleazzo's presence at the French court might excite.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of political affairs when, on the 18th of May, 1493,\r\nLodovico and Beatrice, with their infant son, arrived at Ferrara. They\r\nspent the night before their arrival at the palazzo Trotti, in the\r\nsuburbs, and on the following morning entered the town by the bridge of\r\nCastel Tealde. After riding in state up the Via Grande and the Via degli\r\nSablioni to the Castello they visited the Duomo, attended mass, and made\r\nan offering at the altar. The Piazza was decorated with green boughs and\r\nbright draperies, and crowds thronged the streets, shouting \"_Moro!\r\nMoro!_\" as the young duchess rode by in all her bravery, escorted by her\r\nbrother Alfonso and Madonna Anna, who had ridden out to meet her, with a\r\ngay company of Ferrarese lords and ladies. That day Beatrice wore the\r\n_camora_ of wonderful crimson brocade, embroidered with the lighthouse\r\ntowers of the port of Genoa, and a velvet cap studded with big pearls,\r\n\"as large as are Madama's very largest gems,\" wrote the faithful\r\nProsperi to Isabella d'Este, \"as well as five splendid rubies.\"\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Lodovico was determined to dazzle the eyes of the world\r\nby his splendour, and the robes and jewels of Beatrice were the wonder\r\nof Ferrara and Venice. Ten chariots and fifty mules laden with baggage\r\nfollowed in their train, and Prosperi describes one marvellous new\r\n_camora_, which Beatrice brought with her, embroidered with Lodovico's\r\nfavourite device of the caduceus worked in large pearls, rubies, and\r\ndiamonds, with one big diamond at the top. Not to be outdone by her\r\nsister-in-law, Madonna Anna appeared in a crimson and grey satin robe,\r\nadorned with letters of massive gold, and borrowed her mother-in-law's\r\nfinest pearls for the occasion, so that, as Prosperi reports, her jewels\r\nmade almost as fine a show as those of the duchess. Nor was this rivalry\r\nin clothes and jewels limited to the royal ladies themselves. Our lively\r\nfriend, Duchess Leonora's maid of honour, Teodora, gives Isabella an\r\namusing account of the keen emulation that existed between the Milanese\r\nand Ferrarese ladies who were to accompany the two duchesses to\r\nVenice.[37] Beatrice's ladies each wore long gold chains, valued at two\r\nhundred ducats apiece, and her chief maids of honour had been provided\r\nwith some of their mistress's brocade robes for the occasion. Hearing of\r\nthis, the Ferrarese ladies begged duchess Leonora to give them similar\r\nnecklaces, and did not rest until they were supplied with chains valued\r\nat two hundred and twenty ducats apiece. And since it transpired that\r\nBeatrice had given some of her ladies strings of pearls for their\r\npaternosters, Madama presented each of her attendants with pearl\r\nrosaries of a still handsomer and costlier description. When Signor\r\nLodovico saw this, he went up to Beatrice, saying, \"Wife, I wish all of\r\nyour ladies to wear pearl rosaries;\" and straightway ordered some much\r\nlarger and finer ones to be made for the Duchess of Bari's attendants.\r\n\"But Madama,\" adds Isabella's correspondent, gleefully, \"has given some\r\nof her smaller pendants to our ladies, a thing which I do not think the\r\nduchess can supply; and there is one other point in which the duchess's\r\nsuite will come off the worst. Madama has had pelisses of green satin\r\nwith broad stripes of black velvet made for all her ladies, which they\r\nare to wear at Venice, and is taking a fresh supply of jewels to lend\r\nthem when they arrive. This I think the duchess can hardly manage.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the next day Prosperi reports that the famous goldsmith\r\nCaradosso has just arrived with a quantity of rubies and diamonds, which\r\nMesser Lodovico has bought for two thousand ducats, and is having strung\r\ninto necklaces for his wife's ladies.\r\n\r\nA week of brilliant festivities had been arranged by Duke Ercole in\r\nhonour of his son-in-law. A splendid tournament was held one day on the\r\nPiazza in front of the Castello. \"Messer Galeazzo rode in the lists,\"\r\nwrites the old chronicler of Ferrara, \"with all his usual _gentilezza_,\r\nand carried off the prize against his brothers Caiazzo and Fracassa,\r\nNiccolo da Correggio, Ermes Sforza, and all other rivals. Afterwards,\r\ntaking a massive lance in his hand, he charged a gentleman of Mirandola,\r\nbroke his lance, and unseated him, so that both horse and man rolled\r\nover together. And Lodovico sent one hundred ducats to the soldier of\r\nMirandola, because he fought so well. Another day a single-handed\r\ncontest between a Milanese and a Mantuan man-at-arms was held in the\r\ncourtyard of the castle, and won by the Mantuan, and Lodovico gave him a\r\nsatin vest with a gold fringe and skirt of silver cloth, and the Marquis\r\nof Mantua and others made him fine presents.\"[38] Then came the\r\nhorse-races for the _pallium_, which Don Alfonso won, and at which\r\nGianfrancesco Gonzaga's famous Barbary horses made a splendid show. A\r\nbeautiful _festa_ was also held one afternoon in the gardens, at which\r\nall the court assisted, and in the evenings, theatrical representations\r\nof the _Menæchmi_ and other Latin plays were given, which pleased\r\nLodovico so well that he declared he must build a theatre at Milan on\r\nhis return. Amongst the pieces given on this occasion was a comedy, of\r\nwhich the plot, Prosperi remarks, appeared to be aimed against Signor\r\nLodovico, but it seems to have given him no offence.\r\n\r\nThe Moro was apparently in the highest good-humour, courteous and\r\naffable, after his wont, to all, and full of proud delight in his wife\r\nand child. He admired the palaces and gardens of Ferrara, and surveyed\r\nDuke Ercole's latest improvements with keen interest. The width and\r\ncleanliness of the streets, struck him especially, and he determined to\r\nfollow the duke's example and remove the forges and shops which blocked\r\nup the road and interfered with the traffic and the pleasantness of the\r\nprospect at Milan. But of all the sights which he saw in Ferrara, what\r\npleased him best was Ercole's beautiful villa of Belriguardo. On\r\nSaturday, the 25th of May, after Beatrice and her mother had started for\r\nVenice, Ercole took his son-in-law and the Milanese nobles to spend the\r\nday at this his favourite country house, and entertained the party at a\r\nbanquet in the famous terraced gardens on the banks of the Po. The same\r\nevening Lodovico found time to write to his wife, in which he tells her\r\nhow much he is enjoying the loveliness of the summer evening at\r\nBelriguardo.\r\n\r\n\"I would not for all the world have missed seeing this place. Really, I\r\ndo not think that I have ever seen so large and fine a house, or one\r\nwhich is so well laid out and adorned with such excellent pictures. I do\r\nnot believe there is another to rival it in the whole world, and did not\r\nthink it possible to find a villa at once so spacious and so thoroughly\r\ncomfortable and well arranged. To say the truth, if I were asked whether\r\nVigevano, or the Castello of Pavia, or this place was the finest palace\r\nin the world--the Castello must forgive me, for I would certainly choose\r\nBelriguardo!\"[39]\r\n\r\nFrom Belriguardo, Ercole and his son-in-law proceeded to visit\r\nMirandola, the castle and principality of Bianca d'Este's husband, Count\r\nGaleotto, and the court of the scholar princes of Carpi, who were\r\nintimately connected with the Sanseverini and other noble Milanese\r\nhouses. After visiting Modena, the ducal party returned to receive the\r\nVenetian ambassadors at Ferrara, and accompanied them to Belriguardo,\r\nwhich Lodovico was not sorry to visit a second time. Here the Moro took\r\nfarewell of his hosts, and, leaving his infant son at Ferrara to await\r\nhis mother's return, he set out for Parma, on his way back to Milan.\r\n\r\nHere at Torgiara, in the Parmesana, he was joined by his envoy, Count\r\nBelgiojoso, who, in his anxiety to bring his master the latest news, had\r\nridden the whole 600 miles from Senlis in six days. This faithful\r\nservant had already written to give Lodovico details of the treaty\r\nconcluded between Charles VIII. and Maximilian, and had informed him of\r\nthe French king's resolve to invade Italy without delay. Now, at his\r\nmaster's summons, he rode to Parma as fast as relays of the fleetest\r\nhorses could take him, and fell seriously ill on the day after his\r\narrival. The news which he brought determined Lodovico in the policy\r\nwhich he was about to adopt, and decided him to withdraw all opposition\r\nto the French king's expedition against Naples. Charles VIII. now\r\nappeared as the friend and ally of Maximilian, and even consented to\r\nsupport Lodovico's suit with the King of the Romans. \"It seems strange,\"\r\nwrote the Florentine ambassador at the French court to Piero de' Medici,\r\n\"that the king should support Signor Lodovico in a thing so harmful to\r\nthe interests of his cousin the Duke of Orleans' claims, but so it is,\r\nand this will show you the influence that now predominates in the royal\r\ncounsels.\"\r\n\r\nBelgiojoso reached Torgiara, in the district of Parma, on the 4th of\r\nJune, and on the 24th, Maximilian sent the despatch from the castle of\r\nGmünden, by which he accepted the hand of Bianca Sforza in marriage, and\r\npromised Lodovico Sforza the investiture of the duchy of Milan as soon\r\nas he himself should receive the imperial dignity. In the same month of\r\nJune, the marriage of the Pope's daughter, Lucrezia Borgia, to Giovanni\r\nSforza of Pesaro was celebrated with great pomp in the Vatican, and the\r\nPope and cardinals joined in the orgies which followed. But old King\r\nFerrante gnashed his teeth with rage, and his son Alfonso vowed\r\nvengeance against the hated Moro and all his crew. And in the Duomo of\r\nFlorence, the fiery Dominican friar, Fra Girolamo of San Marco,\r\npreaching with passionate fervour to the crowds who hung on his lips,\r\nboldly denounced the shameless profligacy that reigned in high places,\r\nand warned the Church and the world of the avenging sword of the Lord.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 374.\r\n\r\n[38] Muratori, R.

Clemente--Their\r\ntriumphal entry--Procession and _fêtes_ in the Grand Canal--Letter of\r\nBeatrice to her husband--The palace of the Dukes of Ferrara in Venice.\r\n\r\n1493\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1493, as we have already said, proved a turning-point in\r\nLodovico Sforza's policy. And it also marked a new period in the life of\r\nBeatrice d'Este. Up to this time the young duchess was a bright and\r\njoyous child, intellectual and cultivated like the other ladies of her\r\nfamily, but eager, above all, to enjoy the splendour and gaiety of her\r\nnew life, to taste of every pleasure, and fling herself into every\r\npassing amusement. But now she appears in a new light. For the first\r\ntime, on this visit to Venice, she takes a leading part in political\r\naffairs, and comes before the Doge and Senate as her husband's\r\nambassador and spokeswoman. Here we see this princess, who was not yet\r\neighteen years of age, assuming the character of orator and diplomatist,\r\nand revealing these talents which excited the admiration of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian and made him pronounce her unlike all other women.\r\n\r\nIn selecting his young wife for this important mission, Lodovico had\r\nacted with his usual prudence and forethought. He saw her remarkable\r\npowers of mind, and trusted implicitly in her womanly tact and charm.\r\nWhen the Venetian Senate first heard that Lodovico was to visit Ferrara,\r\nthey announced their intention of sending ambassadors to request him to\r\naccompany the two duchesses to Venice. But the Moro felt that, at this\r\ncritical moment of his negotiations with both Charles VIII. and\r\nMaximilian, his presence at Venice might lead to awkward questions and\r\nexcite the suspicion of these princes. So he preferred to send his wife,\r\nwhose journey with her mother and brother would appear rather in the\r\nlight of a party of pleasure, and whose youth and charms would disarm\r\nsuspicion, and at the same time exert a beneficial influence on the\r\ncounsels of the Republic. In the written instructions which he gave\r\nTuttavilla and the other envoys who accompanied Beatrice, they were\r\ndesired to lay especial stress on the honour which the rulers of Milan\r\nwere doing the Signory of Venice by the choice of so exalted a lady to\r\nbe their messenger.\r\n\r\n\"The presence of the most illustrious Duchess of Bari is the best proof\r\ntheir Excellencies can have of the singular satisfaction with which the\r\nDukes of Milan and Bari regard the conclusion of this league. In\r\nsending, the one his aunt, the other his wife, who is the dearest thing\r\nthat he possesses, to congratulate the Signory on this auspicious\r\noccasion, they show you how great and exceptional is the pleasure which\r\nthey feel at this alliance between our two states.\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 25th of May, the Duchess of Ferrara, with her two\r\ndaughters, Beatrice Duchess of Bari and Madonna Anna Sforza, and her son\r\nAlfonso, accompanied by a large retinue numbering in all 1200 persons,\r\nsailed down the Po into the Adriatic, on their way to Venice. Beatrice\r\nwas accompanied by Antonio Trivulzio, Bishop of Como, Francesco Sforza\r\nand his wife, and several other Milanese gentlemen of rank, besides the\r\nfour ambassadors already named, and in her train were the famous Flemish\r\ntenor Cordier and the other court singers of the ducal chapel. On the\r\n20th the party reached Chioggia, where they were entertained in the\r\nhouses of noble Venetian families, and on the following day sailed up\r\nbetween the islands, under the long sandy shore of the Lido, into the\r\nport of Venice. At Malamocco, the fort on the southern point of Lido\r\nguarding the entrance of the harbour, they were received by a deputation\r\nof patricians, while at S. Clemente the old Doge, Agostino Barbarigo,\r\nhimself came out to meet them in the bucentaur, followed by an immense\r\ncompany of boats and gondolas in festive array.\r\n\r\n\"Of all cities that I have ever known, Venice is the one where the\r\ngreatest honour is paid to strangers,\" wrote Philippe de Commines, when,\r\na year and a half later, he came to Venice as ambassador from his most\r\nChristian Majesty. And on this occasion the welcome offered to the wife\r\nof the powerful Moro was grander, and the _fêtes_ given in her honour\r\nwere more splendid, than had been seen for many years.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" wrote Taddeo de' Vimercati, the Milanese ambassador, \"was lord\r\nor lady received with greater joy, or more magnificently entertained\r\nthan the duchess has been on this occasion.\" And in his letters to his\r\nwife Isabella, the Marquis of Mantua, who had arrived at Venice three\r\ndays earlier, and was among the spectators of his mother and\r\nsister-in-law's triumphal entry, dilates on the extraordinary honours\r\nthat were paid them, on the vast concourse of people assembled to greet\r\ntheir arrival, and the exultation with which they were received. He\r\ndescribes the procession of barks and gondolas, filled with ladies in\r\ngay toilettes, that were seen rowing across the lagoon many hours before\r\nthe arrival of the illustrious visitors, and tells how the old Doge--the\r\nsame whose venerable figure is familiar to us in Giovanni Bellini's\r\naltar-piece, at Murano--made his way to S. Clemente early in the\r\nafternoon, and retired to rest for an hour or two, in a chamber prepared\r\nfor his Serene Highness, until the Ferrarese bucentaurs were seen in the\r\ndistance. Gianfrancesco dwells on the number and beauty of the gaily\r\ndecorated barges and triremes, and describes the magnificent loggia hung\r\nwith tapestries and wreaths of flowers which had been erected in front\r\nof the _palazzo_ occupied by the Milanese ambassador, at the entrance of\r\nthe Canal Grande. But what impressed him most of all were the thundering\r\nsalvoes of artillery which burst from the fleet of galleys, from the\r\narsenal and the Milanese embassy, at one and the same moment, as about\r\nfive o'clock the Ferrarese bucentaurs reached Malamocco and entered the\r\nVenetian waters. \"The whole air,\" he writes, \"was filled with confusion,\r\nwhen these demonstrations of great rejoicing burst simultaneously upon\r\nour ears.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella d'Este, who had herself lately returned from Venice and was now\r\nwith her beloved sister-in-law, Elizabeth Duchess of Urbino, at the\r\nvilla of Porto, devoured her husband's letters greedily, although she\r\nprofessed indifference, and wrote to her mother, \"To me all these\r\nceremonies seem very much of the same nature, and are all alike very\r\ntedious and monotonous.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one point, however, upon which Gianfrancesco confessed himself\r\nunable to gratify his wife and sister's curiosity. \"I will not attempt,\"\r\nhe says, \"to describe the gowns and ornaments worn by these duchesses\r\nand Madonna Anna, this being quite out of my line, and will only tell\r\nyou that all three of them appeared resplendent with the most precious\r\njewels.\"[40] Fortunately, this omission was supplied by one of\r\nBeatrice's secretaries, Niccolo de' Negri, who, in a letter to Lodovico,\r\ninformed him, on the day of her arrival at Venice, that the duchess wore\r\nher gold brocade, embroidered with crimson doves, with a jewelled\r\nfeather in her cap, and a rope of pearls and diamonds round her neck, to\r\nwhich the priceless ruby known as El Spigo was attached as pendant. But\r\nthe best account we have of Beatrice's visit to Venice is contained in\r\nfour of her own letters addressed to her husband, which have been\r\npreserved in the archives of Milan. They were originally published\r\ntwenty years ago by Molmenti, who, however, omitted some portions which\r\nare given here, and transcribed some of the dates incorrectly.\r\nUnfortunately, several of the letters in which Beatrice daily recorded\r\nthe events of this memorable week for her lord's benefit are missing.\r\nBut although the narrative is incomplete, it is none the less of rare\r\nvalue and interest. The first two letters after her departure from\r\nFerrara are missing, but in their stead we have two notes from Lodovico,\r\nwhich show how tenderly he thought of his absent wife, and how carefully\r\nhe followed her movements. On the evening of the 25th, he wrote the\r\nletter that has been already quoted, from Belriguardo; on the 26th, he\r\nsent her a second note in reply to the letters which he had just\r\nreceived. In one of these Beatrice had apparently given a lively account\r\nof her triumphs at cards in the games which she had played with her\r\ncompanions on board the bucentaur. Like Isabella d'Este and most of her\r\ncontemporaries, the duchess was very fond of _scartino_ and other\r\nfashionable card-games, and had the reputation of being exceptionally\r\nlucky. In the course of the year 1494, Lodovico informed Girolamo\r\nTuttavilla, who was at one time treasurer to the duchess, that his wife\r\nhad won no less than three thousand ducats, all of which she declared\r\nhad been spent in alms. \"When I remarked that this seemed a very large\r\nsum, the duchess confessed she had paid some of it to embroiderers and\r\nother craftsmen. Even then I fail to see how she could have disposed of\r\nmore than a few hundred ducats. At this rate I fear she will be unable\r\nto buy lands or build new houses, but when you return from Naples, we\r\nmust try and carry out some plans better worthy of your name.\"\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Beatrice seems to have won a considerable sum of money\r\nat the game of _britino_ during her journey to Chioggia, and had\r\napparently informed her husband of her good luck, for he writes in\r\nreply--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAREST WIFE,\r\n\r\n\"It has given me the greatest pleasure to hear from your last letters\r\nthat you have been winning your companions' money, and since I conclude\r\nyou have been playing at _buttino_, I hope you will remember to keep\r\naccount of your winnings, so that you may keep the money for yourself.\r\nBut I only say this in case you win, as if you lose, I do not care to\r\nhear about it. Commend me to the illustrious Madonna Duchessa, our\r\ncommon mother, as well as to Don Alfonso and Madonna Anna, and salute\r\nall the councillors for me.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your most affectionate husband,\r\n                                          LODOVICUS MARIA SFORTIA.[41]\r\n\r\nBelriguardo, 26th of May, 1493.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of Beatrice's letters that we have was written on the evening\r\nof her arrival at her father's house in Venice and is dated May 27.\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE AND EXCELLENT LORD, MY DEAREST HUSBAND,\r\n\r\n\"I wrote to you yesterday of our arrival at Chioggia. This morning I\r\nheard mass in a chapel of the house where I lodged. The singers\r\nassisted, and I felt the greatest spiritual delight in hearing them,\r\nMesser Cordier as usual doing his part very well, as he did also\r\nyesterday morning. Certainly his singing is the greatest consolation\r\npossible. Then we breakfasted, and at ten we entered the bucentaur,\r\ndividing our company between the middle-sized and small bucentaur and a\r\nfew gondolas, which were prepared for us, as being safer, since the\r\nweather was still rather stormy. My most illustrious mother, Don Alfonso\r\nand Madonna Anna, with a very few servants, entered the small bucentaur,\r\nand the other ladies and gentlemen travelled on the larger bucentaur, or\r\nin small gondolas, while I entered another gondola with Signor Girolamo,\r\nMesser Visconti, and a few others, so as to lighten the small bucentaur\r\nand travel more comfortably, as we were assured. So we set out and\r\nreached the port of Chioggia, where the ships began to dance. I took the\r\ngreatest delight in tossing up and down, and, by the grace of God, did\r\nnot feel the least ill effects. But I can tell you that some of our\r\nparty were very much alarmed, amongst others Signor Ursino, Niccolo de'\r\nNegri, and Madonna Elisabetta. Even Signor Girolamo, although he had\r\nbeen very frugal, felt rather uncomfortable; but no one in my gondola\r\nwas really ill, excepting Madonna Elisabetta and Cavaliere Ursino, at\r\nthe port of Chioggia. Most of the others, especially the women, were\r\nvery ill. The weather now improved so much, that we arrived at Malamocco\r\nin quite good time. Here we found about twenty-four gentlemen, with\r\nthree well-fitted and decorated barges, one of which we entered, with as\r\nmany of our suite as it could hold, and were honourably seated in the\r\nprow. Several Venetian gentlemen now entered our barge, and a certain\r\nMesser Francesco Capello, clad in a long mantle of white brocade,\r\nembroidered with large gold patterns, like your own, delivered an\r\noration to the effect that this illustrious Signory, having heard of\r\nyour presence at Ferrara, had sent two ambassadors to show the love they\r\nbear you, and that now, having heard of my Lady Mother's and my own\r\nvisit to Venice, they had sent the other gentlemen who received us at\r\nChioggia, and now, as a further token of their affection, sent these to\r\nMalamocco, to express the great pleasure the Signory felt at our coming,\r\nand to inform us that the Doge himself, with the Signory and a number\r\nof noble matrons, were about to give us welcome and do us honour to the\r\nbest of their power. My mother, with her usual modesty, begged me to\r\nreply, but I insisted on her saying a few words, and afterwards began to\r\nspeak myself. But hardly had she finished speaking, and before I had\r\nbegun, than all the gentlemen ran up to kiss our hands, as they had done\r\nthe day before, so that I could only express my feelings by courteous\r\ngestures.\r\n\r\n\"Then we set off towards Venice, and before we reached S. Clemente,\r\nwhere the Prince was expecting us, two rafts came towards us, and\r\nsaluted us with the sound of trumpets and firing of guns, followed by\r\ntwo galleys ready for battle, and other barks decked out like gardens,\r\nwhich were really beautiful to see. An infinite number of boats, full of\r\nladies and gentlemen, now surrounded us, and escorted us all the way to\r\nS. Clemente. Here we landed, and were conducted to a spacious pavilion\r\nhung with drapery, where the Prince, accompanied by the members of the\r\nSignory, met us and bade us welcome, assuring us how eagerly our\r\npresence had been desired, and saying that my lord father the duke and\r\nyour Excellency could do him no greater pleasure than to send us, whom\r\nhe looked upon as his dear daughters. All this and much more concerning\r\nthe fatherly love which he bore us, he hoped to be able to express at a\r\nfuture occasion. Then he placed my lady mother on his right and myself\r\non his left, with Madonna Anna next to me, and next to my mother the\r\nMarquis of Mantua and Don Alfonso--the Marchese having arrived with the\r\nPrince--and so he conducted us on board the bucentaur. On the way we\r\nshook hands with all the ladies, who stood up in two rows behind the\r\nPrince, and then sat down in the same order. All of our ladies shook\r\nhands with the Prince, and we set out again on our journey, meeting an\r\ninfinite number of decorated galleys, boats, and barks. Among others,\r\nthere was a raft with figures of Neptune and Minerva, armed with trident\r\nand spear, seated on either side of a hill crowned with the arms of the\r\nPope and our own illustrious lord, together with your own and those of\r\nthe Signory of Venice. First Neptune began to dance and gambol and throw\r\nballs into the air to the sound of drums and tambourines, and then\r\nMinerva did the same. Afterwards they both joined hands and danced\r\ntogether. Next Minerva struck the mountain with her spear, and an olive\r\ntree appeared. Neptune did the same with his trident, and a horse jumped\r\nout. Then other personages appeared on the mountain with open books in\r\ntheir hands, signifying that they had come to decide on the name that\r\nwas to be given to the city on the mountain, and they gave judgment in\r\nfavour of Minerva. This representation was said to signify that the\r\nexistence of states is founded on treaties of peace, and that those who\r\nlay the foundations will give their name to future kingdoms, as Minerva\r\ndid to Athens.\r\n\r\n\"As we sailed on, we saw many other barks and galleys, all richly\r\ndecorated. Among them was one galley of armed Milanese, with a Moor in\r\nthe centre, armed with a spear, and bearing shields with the ducal arms\r\nand your own fastened to the stern and prow. Round this Moor were\r\nfigures of Fortitude, Temperance, Justice, and Wisdom with a sceptre in\r\nhis hand, all of which made a fine pageant, and the firing of guns and\r\ncannons at the same time sounded quite splendid.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these there were many barks representing the different arts and\r\ncrafts of Venice, very beautiful to see. And so we entered the Canal\r\nGrande, where the Prince, who talked to us all the way with the utmost\r\nfamiliarity and kindness, took great pleasure in showing us the chief\r\npalaces of this noble city, and pointing out the ladies, who appeared\r\nglittering with jewels at all the balconies and windows, besides the\r\ngreat company--about a hundred and thirty in number--who were already\r\nwith us in the bucentaur. All the palaces were richly adorned, and\r\ncertainly it was a magnificent sight. The Prince showed us all the chief\r\nobjects along the canal, until we reached my father's palace, where we\r\nare lodged, and where the Prince insisted on landing and conducting us\r\nto our rooms, although my mother and I begged him not to take this\r\ntrouble. We found all the palace hung with tapestries, and the beds\r\ncovered with satin draperies adorned with the ducal arms and those of\r\nyour Excellency. And the rooms and hall are hung with Sforzesca colours,\r\nso you see that in point of good entertainment, good company, and good\r\nliving we could desire nothing better. This evening three gentlemen\r\ncame to visit me in the name of the Signory, and made the most splendid\r\noffers, beyond all that could have been expected, for my pleasure and\r\nconvenience. To-morrow, if the audience has taken place, you shall hear\r\nmore. I commend myself to your Highness.[42]\r\n\r\n\"Venice, May 27, 1493.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Era stupendissima cesa a vedere!_ It was a magnificent sight!\"\r\nexclaimed Beatrice. And indeed the scene was one which would have\r\nstirred a less impressionable nature than that of this young princess,\r\nwho was so keenly alive to joy and beauty, and who now for the first\r\ntime saw \"this most triumphant city of the world,\" in all the loveliness\r\nof the summer evening. Both the Milanese ambassador and the Marquis of\r\nMantua said they had never seen the like. The blue waters of the lagoon\r\nswarmed with boats and gondolas decked with flowers and streamers of the\r\ngayest hues, the Venetian Gothic palaces along the canal were hung with\r\nIndian and Persian carpets. The rich colours of Oriental stuffs relieved\r\nthe dazzling whiteness of Istrian stone, and festoons of fresh leaves\r\nand flowers were twisted round their columns of porphyry and serpentine.\r\nFrom each carved balcony and painted window fair Venetian ladies looked\r\ndown in their sumptuous robes, glittering with gold and gems, and the\r\nair rang with the _Vivas_ of the crowds who filled the gondolas or\r\nflocked along the Riva to see the gay pageant. It was a spectacle such\r\nas Venice alone could offer in these days of her glory, when the Canal\r\nGrande was, as Commines justly said, the finest street in the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAnd the Palazzo to which the old Doge conducted Beatrice and her mother\r\nwas the oldest and one of the grandest in that long avenue of palaces.\r\nOriginally built for the Pesaro family, it had been presented to Niccolo\r\nII. of Este in gratitude for his services when, a hundred years before,\r\nhe had supplied the Republic with corn during the long war against\r\nGenoa. Since then the house had been repeatedly sequestered during the\r\nwars between Venice and Ferrara, and had only been restored to Duke\r\nErcole after the conclusion of the peace of Bagnolo. Now its ancient\r\nwalls, dating as far back as the year 900, had been freshly decorated\r\nwith frescoes, and the long arcades and loggias, with their massive\r\npillars and Byzantine capitals of grey marble, were enriched with\r\nshields carved with the unicorns and lilies of the house of Este.\r\nWithin, the spacious halls were lavishly adorned with gilding and\r\nvariegated marble, with fine pictures and the painted _cassoni_ and\r\nchairs which we still admire on old Venetian palaces, while the\r\ntapestries and hangings bearing Sforza devices and the Moro's favourite\r\nmottoes met Beatrice's eyes at every turn. As she wrote in her joyous\r\nletters to her husband, there was nothing lacking that could charm the\r\neyes or please the mind, and the courtesy and hospitality of the\r\nvenerable old Doge and of the Venetian Signory left nothing to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] \"Storia di Venezia nella Vita privata,\" p. 60.\r\n\r\n[41] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 376.\r\n\r\n[42] Molmenti, _op. cit._, p. 693.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_Fêtes_ at Venice in honour of the Duchess of Ferrara and Duchess of\r\nBari--Beatrice d'Este has an audience with the Doge and\r\nSignory--Explains Lodovico's position and his treaties with France and\r\nGermany--Visit to St. Mark's and the Treasury--_Fête_ in the ducal\r\npalace--The Duchess visits the Great Council--Takes leave of the\r\nDoge--Return to Ferrara.\r\n\r\n1493\r\n\r\n\r\nA series of _fêtes_ had been arranged by the Doge and Signory of Venice\r\nin honour of their illustrious guests, and the order in which they took\r\nplace is given by the Marquis of Mantua in a letter to his wife. On\r\nTuesday races were held in the piazza for a _pallinum_ of twenty yards\r\nof crimson velvet; on Wednesday afternoon a regatta took place on the\r\nRiva. Amongst other amusing contests, Pietro Bembo tells us there was a\r\nrace between boats rowed by four women, a thing never before seen in\r\nVenice, and which, on account of its novelty, excited the greatest\r\namusement. \"In which marvellous contention,\" says Bembo, \"a thing\r\nhappened which added greatly to the pleasure of the spectacle and to the\r\ngeneral mirth. A bark won the race that was rowed by a mother and her\r\ntwo daughters and one daughter-in-law, this being arranged out of\r\ncompliment to Duchess Leonora, who has herself two daughters and one\r\ndaughter-in-law.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning after her arrival, Beatrice received a visit from three\r\ngentlemen sent by the Doge to confer with her on the object of her\r\nmission. Much to their surprise and admiration, says Romanini, the\r\nVenetian historian, the young duchess, who was not yet twenty years of\r\nage, requested to be allowed the honour of an audience with the Signory.\r\nBefore leaving the Este palace these gentlemen assisted at mass, which\r\nwas privately celebrated in the duchess's rooms, and heard Cordier sing,\r\nas we learn from a short note addressed to Lodovico on the morning of\r\nthe 28th.\r\n\r\n\"This morning,\" she writes, \"as soon as I was dressed, I heard mass sung\r\nin my own rooms. Messer Cordier sang, and, as usual, did his part\r\nadmirably, which pleased me greatly, both on account of the rare delight\r\nwhich his talent gives me, and because on this occasion the gentlemen\r\nwho had been sent to see me by the Doge were also present, and expressed\r\nthe greatest admiration for his singing.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice and the four Milanese ambassadors were then escorted to the\r\nducal palace, where the young duchess was admitted to the Sala del\r\nCollegio, and laid her husband's memorial before the Signory. But, as M.\r\nDelaborde remarks, the language which Beatrice employed on this occasion\r\ndiffered considerably from the written instructions which had been given\r\nto the Milanese envoys by Lodovico. During the interval, Belgiojoso's\r\ndespatches relating to the Treaty of Senlis, and announcing the French\r\nking's fixed intention of undertaking an expedition against Naples, had\r\nproduced a sensible alteration in Lodovico's policy. In the letter of\r\nthe 10th of May, the ambassadors were desired to congratulate the\r\nVenetian Signory in the most cordial terms on the conclusion of the\r\nleague between Milan, the Pope, and the Republic, and to dwell\r\nespecially on the importance of being in readiness to resist foreign\r\ninvasions at this critical time when the French monarch and the King of\r\nthe Romans were about to settle their differences. But when Beatrice\r\nherself addressed the Signory, she insisted on the excellent relations\r\nof Lodovico as Regent of Milan with both France and Germany, and, after\r\nsetting forth the pains which her lord had taken to oppose the French\r\nexpedition, laid Belgiojoso's latest despatch before the Signory. In\r\nthis missive the Milanese envoy informed Lodovico of Charles the\r\nEighth's intention to send an envoy to Milan, Venice, and Rome, and seek\r\nthe help of these powers in carrying out his designs for the conquest of\r\nNaples. Beatrice, addressing the Venetian Signory in her lord's name,\r\nasked their advice as to the answer which he should give to the French\r\nking, and ended by informing them of his negotiations with Maximilian\r\nfor the investiture of the duchy of Milan, which, she added, were\r\nalready far advanced. After some deliberation, the Signory returned a\r\ncourteous but evasive answer, begging the duchess to assure her husband\r\nof their most friendly sentiments, but saying that the French king's\r\nproposals required grave consideration, and that they must, first of\r\nall, communicate with the Pope as head of the League.\r\n\r\nAt a second conference which the Doge had with the young duchess on the\r\n1st of June, Beatrice, acting under Lodovico's directions, laid stress\r\non the fact that her husband as regent was all-powerful in Milan, and\r\ncould dispose of the treasure and castles of Lombardy at his pleasure.\r\nThe Doge understood by this, as we learn from the secret records of the\r\nVenetian Government, that the real aim of the duchess was to discover\r\nhow far the Republic was disposed to uphold Lodovico's claim to the\r\nducal title, but he merely returned a civil answer and repeated his\r\nprofessions of friendship. If Beatrice's mission, however, secured no\r\nvery tangible result from the wise and crafty Venetian, her charms made\r\na deep impression upon the old councillors, who one and all marvelled at\r\nher wisdom and eloquence, and grudged no pains or expense to give her\r\npleasure. \"No honours,\" writes Cardinal Bembo, \"were held too great for\r\nthese royal ladies, who in those joyous times had come to see the city,\r\nnor was any kind of pleasure or generous liberality lacking in the\r\nsplendid _fêtes_ with which they were entertained on this memorable\r\noccasion.\" As for Beatrice herself, she was enchanted with the beauties\r\nof Venice and the courtesy of her hosts, and longed to see and hear all\r\nthe wonders of the famous city. The greater part of these days was spent\r\nin visiting the chief sights of the place--the great Dominican and\r\nFranciscan churches, S. Zanipolo with the tombs of the doges and the\r\nGothic shrine of S. Maria Gloriosa with Giovanni Bellini's newly painted\r\nMadonnas in all their radiant loveliness, the graceful Renaissance\r\nbuildings of S. Maria dei Miracoli and the Scuola di S. Marco, which the\r\nLombardi had lately finished. Like all royal visitors, the duchesses\r\nwere conducted over the arsenal, which Commines justly calls the finest\r\nthing of the kind in the whole world, and were shown not only the fleet\r\nof a hundred ships in port, but the galleys in course of construction,\r\nthe men making the oars, the women and children at work on the sails and\r\nropes, the sulphur and saltpetre mills, and the splendid armoury, all\r\nenclosed within lofty walls, and guarded by twin towers crowned with the\r\nwinged lion. And they saw what was indeed one of the wonders of the\r\nworld--the glorious front of St. Mark's just as we see it in Gentile\r\nBellini's great picture, with the many domes and myriads of pillars, the\r\nglittering mosaics and famous bronze horses, and the crimson standards\r\nfloating from the three tall Venetian masts on the Piazza. We are not\r\ntold whether Beatrice, like her sister Isabella d'Este, ascended the\r\nCampanile to enjoy the wonderful prospect over the lagoons, but we know\r\nthat she went to hear the singing of the Augustinian nuns, a community\r\nof noble Venetian maidens as famous for the many scandals attached to\r\ntheir society as for the perfection of their musical services. Above all\r\nthings in Venice, the duchesses admired the magnificent pile of the\r\nducal palace and the noble mural paintings on which the Bellini and\r\ntheir fellow-artists were at work in the Great Hall, a sight of which\r\nthe great fire of the sixteenth century has deprived future generations.\r\n\r\nBut the most splendid _fête_ given in Beatrice's honour was the banquet,\r\nball, and torchlight procession that were held on Thursday in the ducal\r\npalace. That same morning the duchesses attended mass in state at St.\r\nMark's, and by the Doge's request the Milanese choir took part in the\r\nservice. Beatrice's letters to her husband give a full account of the\r\nday's festivities--\r\n\r\n\"MOST EXCELLENT AND ILLUSTRIOUS LORD, MY DEAREST HUSBAND,\r\n\r\n\"To continue my relation of what is happening here day by day, I must\r\nnow inform you that this morning my illustrious mother, Don Alfonso,\r\nMadonna Anna, and I, with all our company, set out for St. Mark's, where\r\nthe Prince invited both us and our singers to assist at mass and see the\r\nTreasury. But before reaching St. Mark's, we landed at the Rialto, and\r\nwent on foot up those streets which are called the Merceria, where we\r\nsaw the shops of spices and silks and other merchandise, all in fair\r\norder and excellent both in quality and in the great quantity and\r\nvariety of goods for sale. And of other crafts there was also a goodly\r\ndisplay, so much so that we stopped constantly to look at now one thing,\r\nnow at another, and were quite sorry when we reached St. Mark's. Here\r\nour trumpets sounded from a loggia in front of the church, and we found\r\nthe prince, who advanced to meet us at the doors of St. Mark's, and\r\nplacing himself as before, between my illustrious mother and myself, led\r\nus to the high altar, where we found the priest already vested. There we\r\nknelt down with the prince and said the confession, and then took the\r\nseats prepared for us and heard mass, which the priest and his\r\nassistants sang with great solemnity, and our singers did their part,\r\nand their singing greatly pleased both the Prince and all who were\r\npresent, especially that of Cordier, who always takes great pains to do\r\nhonour to your Highness. After mass, we accompanied the Prince to see\r\nthe Treasury, but had the greatest difficulty in the world to get in,\r\nbecause of the crowds of people who were assembled there, as well as in\r\nthe streets, although every one tried to make room for us, even the\r\nPrince crying out to try and clear the way. But at last the Prince\r\nhimself was forced to retire on account of the great pressure of the\r\ncrowd, and left us to enter with only a few others, and even then we had\r\nthe greatest difficulty to get in. Once safely inside the Treasury we\r\nsaw everything, which was a great pleasure, for there was an infinite\r\nquantity of most beautiful jewels and some magnificent cups and\r\nchalices. When we came out of the Treasury, we went on the Piazza of St.\r\nMark, among the shops of the Ascensiontide fair which is still going on,\r\nand found such a magnificent show of beautiful Venetian glass, that we\r\nwere fairly bewildered, and were obliged to remain there for a long\r\ntime. And as we walked along from shop to shop, every one turned to look\r\nat the jewels which I wore in the velvet cap on my head, and on the vest\r\nembroidered with the towers of the Port of Genoa, and especially at the\r\nlarge diamond which I wore at my breast. And I heard people saying one\r\nto the other--'That is the wife of Signor Lodovico. Look what fine\r\njewels she wears! What splendid rubies and diamonds she has!'\r\n\r\n\"At last, since the hour was already late, we went home to dine, and by\r\nthis time it was nearly two o'clock.[43]\r\n\r\n\"Venice, May 30, 1493.\"\r\n\r\nThe day's labours, however, were hardly begun, and in her next letter\r\nBeatrice resumes her story--\r\n\r\n\"After dinner and a little rest, a large company of gentlemen came to\r\nconduct us to the _festa_ at the palace. We travelled in barges, and,\r\nwhen we reached the palace, were conducted into the Great Hall. There a\r\ngrand tribunal was erected at one end of the hall, in two divisions\r\nrunning the whole length of the walls, and in the centre of the hall a\r\nsquare stage was placed for dancing and theatrical representations. We\r\nascended the tribunal, where we found a number of noble Venetian ladies,\r\none hundred and thirty-two in all, richly adorned with jewels. On the\r\nwing to our right as we entered sat the Lord of the Company of 'the\r\nPotenti'--'a group of the famous company of La Calza, which included the\r\nwealthiest and most illustrious youths of Venice'--seated on a throne\r\nunder a canopy of gold brocade, with Don Alfonso as a member of the\r\ncompany on his right hand. We took our seat on the left wing, and sent\r\nMadonna Anna to take her place by the Lord of the Company. The Prince\r\nwas not present on this occasion, being too old and infirm to take part\r\nin such fatiguing entertainments; but a certain Messer Constantino\r\nPrivolo occupied his place, as the oldest member of the Signory. The\r\nchiefs of the _festa_ led out several ladies to dance, two or three at a\r\ntime, and then came to ask if some of our ladies and gentlemen would not\r\nalso take part in the dance. So, to show our friendly intentions, we\r\nagreed, and Conte Girolamo da Figino and a few others danced. Of the\r\nwomen, the wife of Count Francesco Sforza, the daughters Messer\r\nSigismondo and of Messer Raynaldo, and a few others, also danced. During\r\nthe dancing, by reason of the excessive heat of the room, my head began\r\nto ache, and as my throat also felt a little sore, I left the hall and\r\nretired to rest in another room for an hour. When I returned, it was\r\nalready dark. A hundred lighted torches hung from the ceiling, and a\r\nrepresentation was given on the stage, in which two big animals with\r\nlarge horns appeared, ridden by two figures, bearing golden balls and\r\ncups wreathed with verdure. These two were followed by a triumphal\r\nchariot, in which Justice sat enthroned, holding a drawn sword in her\r\nhand inscribed with the motto _Concordia_, and wreathed with palms and\r\nolive. In the same car was an ox with his feet resting on a figure of\r\nSt. Mark and the adder. This, as your Highness will readily understand,\r\nwas meant to signify the League, and as in all their discourses to me\r\nthe Prince and these gentlemen speak of your Highness as the author of\r\npeace and tranquillity of Italy, so in this representation they placed\r\nyour head on the triumphal arch above the others. Behind the chariot\r\ncame two serpents, ridden by two other youths, dressed like the first\r\nriders. All these figures mounted the tribunal in the centre of the\r\nhall, and danced round Justice, and after dancing for a while, their\r\nballs exploded, and out of the flames, an ox, a lion, an adder, and a\r\nMoor's head suddenly appeared, and all of these danced together round\r\nthe figure of Justice. Then the banquet followed, and the different\r\ndishes and _confetti_ were carried in to the sound of trumpets,\r\naccompanied by an infinite number of torches. First of all came figures\r\nof the Pope, the Doge, and the Duke of Milan, with their armorial\r\nbearings and those of your Highness; then St. Mark, the adder, and the\r\ndiamond, and many other objects, In coloured and gilded sugar, making as\r\nmany as three hundred in all, together with every variety of cakes and\r\nconfectionery, and gold and silver drinking-cups, all of which were\r\nspread out along the hall, and made a splendid show. Among other things,\r\nI saw a figure of the Pope surrounded by ten cardinals, which was said\r\nto be a prophecy of the ten cardinals whom the Pope is going to make\r\nto-morrow! The banquet was spread out upon the stage, and the dishes\r\nwere handed round with many of these triumphs, and the Pope and the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Milan fell to my share. When the banquet was finished, we\r\nhad another representation, in which the two youths on serpents played\r\nthe chief part. A messenger arrived, riding on a triumphal car in a\r\nboat, bearing a letter in a packet, which he presented to the Lord of\r\nthe Company, who opened it, and, after reading the letter, handed it\r\nback to him; then he entered the boat again and left the hall, followed\r\nby the others on their serpents. This last figure was said to be a\r\nherald who had been sent to announce the proclamation of the League, and\r\na little while afterwards the triumphal car of the League, as described\r\nabove, appeared again, followed by four giants. The first one carried a\r\nhorn of foliage and fruit, the two next bore two clubs with gold and\r\nsilver balls, or catapults, while the last carried a cornucopia, similar\r\nto that borne by the first giant in his hand. Then came four animals in\r\nthe shape of Chimeras ridden by four naked Moors, sounding tambourines\r\nand cymbals or clapping their hands. They were followed by four\r\ntriumphal cars, bearing figures of Diana, Death, the mother of Meleager,\r\nand several armed men--four or five persons in each chariot, the whole\r\nintended to represent the story of Meleager, which was fully set forth,\r\nfrom his birth to his death, with interludes of dances. The whole fable\r\nwould take too long to repeat, but Gian Giacomo Gillino will be able to\r\nrecite it from beginning to end, if you care to hear it. This was the\r\nconclusion of the whole _festa_. After this we entered our boats, and\r\nthe clock struck one before we got home. The bishop of Como was sitting\r\nby me all the evening, and his infinite weariness at the length of the\r\nperformance, and his dislike of the great heat in that crowded hall,\r\nmade me laugh as I never laughed before. And in order to tease him and\r\nhave more fun, I kept on telling him that there was still more to come,\r\nand that the acting would go on till to-morrow morning; and it was most\r\namusing to see him stretch himself first on one leg, then on the other,\r\nand to hear him complain, 'My legs are worn out. When will this _festa_\r\never come to an end? Never again will I come to another.' I really think\r\nthat his sighs and groans gave me as much pleasure as the _festa_\r\nitself. When at length we reached home, I supped frugally and then went\r\nto bed, as it was already three o'clock. The gown that I wore after\r\ndinner was of crimson and gold watered silk, with my jewelled cap on my\r\nhead, and the rope of pearls with the Marone as a pendant. I commend\r\nmyself to your Highness. Your Excellency's most affectionate wife,\r\n\r\n                                      \"BEATRICE SFORTIA VISCOMTIS.[44]\r\n\r\nVenetina, May 31, 1493.\"\r\n\r\nOn the back of this letter are the words--\r\n\r\n\"To the most illustrious Prince and excellent Lord, my dearest husband,\r\nthe Lord Lodovico Maria Sfortia, etc. _Ubi. sit. cito. cito._\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 1st of June, Beatrice wrote another letter, in which\r\nshe describes her visit to the Great Council and final interview with\r\nthe Doge, but makes no mention of political affairs, which were no doubt\r\nreserved for a separate despatch.\r\n\r\n\"To-day after dinner,\" she begins, \"we went to the palace, honourably\r\nattended by many Venetian gentlemen, to visit the Great Council, and\r\nwere conducted into the Great Hall. Here in the centre of the hall we\r\nfound the Prince, who had descended from his rooms to meet us, and who\r\naccompanied us to the Tribunal, where we sat in our usual order, and the\r\nCouncil began to vote by ballot for elections to two different offices.\r\nWhen this was over, my lady mother thanked the Prince for all the\r\nhonours which had been paid us, and took her leave. When she had\r\nfinished speaking, I did the same; then, following the instructions\r\nwhich you had given me in your letter, I offered myself as a daughter to\r\nobey all the Doge's commands. The Prince replied that he needed no\r\nthanks, for he had only done what might be expected from a father for a\r\nbeloved daughter, excusing himself if anything had been left undone, and\r\nbegging I would not impute what was lacking to him, but to the failure\r\nof his servants to discharge their duties, and assuring me once more\r\nthat his will could not be better disposed towards me. Then he once more\r\nexpressed the paternal love which he cherished towards our most\r\nillustrious duke, towards your Highness and myself, and again placed\r\nhimself and his Government at the disposal of your Excellency, with many\r\nvery generous expressions, begging me to salute your Highness and beg\r\nyou to be of good courage, and tell you that the Signory accepted all my\r\noffers, and would, if need be, avail themselves gratefully of your help.\r\nAfter this, I replied again in similar terms, and he again desired me to\r\ngreet you warmly from him, and beg you to take good care of your own\r\nhealth and person. Our councillors were then presented to him, and\r\nMonsignore da Como returned thanks very courteously and repeated our\r\nexpressions of gratitude, as was convenient, and then took leave. He\r\nalso replied in suitable terms to all that the Prince had said to me,\r\nwhich speech I will not repeat here, for fear of wearying your\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince then rose and accompanied us to the foot of the great\r\nstaircase, and here shook hands and left us. After that we went to visit\r\nthe Queen of Cyprus at Murano, where she received us with great honour\r\nand gave us a beautiful entertainment. We also visited the shrine of St.\r\nLucia, and so ends my tale for to-day. To-morrow morning, by the grace\r\nof God, we hope to set out on our journey at eight o'clock. I commend\r\nmyself to your Excellency.\r\n\r\n                              \"Your most illustrious lordship's wife,\r\n                                                     BEATRICE SFORTIA.\r\n\r\nVenice, 1st of June, 1493.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, with a pleasant trip across the sunny waters of the lagoon and a\r\n_festa_ in the beautiful gardens of Caterina Cornaro, that royal lady\r\nwho never neglected an opportunity of showing her friendship for the\r\nhouse of Este, Beatrice's week at Venice came to an end. The success of\r\nher visit had been complete, and both the Milanese ambassador and\r\nNiccolo de' Negri were eloquent on the splendour of the _fêtes_ held in\r\nher honour and the favourable impression which she had made on these\r\ngrave and reverend signers.\r\n\r\nThe secretary especially, in his letters to Lodovico, dwells with\r\ncomplacency on the admiration which the young duchess's gowns and\r\njewels, and still more her own charms, had excited among the Venetians.\r\n\"On every occasion the duchess appeared clad in new and beautiful robes\r\nand glittering jewels. Her jewels, indeed, were the wonder of the whole\r\ntown. But I shall not be wrong if I say that the finest jewel of all is\r\nherself--my dear and most excellent Madonna, whose gracious ways and\r\ncharming manners filled all the people of Venice with the utmost delight\r\nand enthusiasm, so that your Highness may well count himself what he\r\nis--the happiest and most fortunate prince in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] E.

The 7th of June was\r\nspent at Belriguardo, and from this favourite villa the young duchess\r\nwrote to her sister, expressing her regret that she would be unable to\r\nvisit Mantua on her return to Milan.\r\n\r\n\"I would most willingly come to see you at Mantua, as I had hoped to do,\r\nand as you know I still desire, and should very much enjoy a few days\r\nwith you in the country, but my husband is exceedingly anxious for my\r\nreturn. So I must beg your Highness to let me enjoy a sight of you in\r\nthe bucentaur, and not to insist upon my landing this time.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella complied with her sister's request, and went to meet the\r\nduchess at Revere, where Beatrice stopped for a few hours on her way up\r\nthe Po, to join her husband at Pavia. Lodovico was naturally impatient,\r\nnot only to see his wife again, but to hear from her own lips all that\r\nhad happened at Venice. And he on his part had much to tell her of the\r\nnews which Belgiojoso had brought from France, and of the despatches\r\nwhich he received from Erasmo Brasca in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe summer months were spent in the Castello of Pavia, where Beatrice\r\nnursed her husband in a slight attack of fever, and afterwards received\r\na visit from her father and brother. They arrived on the 25th of August,\r\nbringing with them a troop of actors to perform the _Menæchmi_ and some\r\nof the other comedies which had pleased Lodovico so much at Ferrara.\r\nDuke Ercole himself, as usual, took keen interest in these theatricals,\r\nand before he left home sent to borrow two complete Turkish costumes and\r\nturbans from the Marquis of Mantua, in order to supply deficiencies in\r\nhis actors' wardrobe. Three days after his arrival, Borso da Correggio,\r\na young nephew of Niccolo, who had travelled to Pavia with the duke,\r\nsent the following note to give his cousin Isabella the latest news of\r\nher family:--\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SISTER AND HONOURED LADY,\r\n\r\n\"We arrived on the 25th at Pavia, and were received by these excellent\r\nlords and ladies with the usual formalities. We find both of the\r\nduchesses well and happy, one of them, indeed--her of Milan--expects the\r\nbirth of another child shortly, but our own duchess is as gay and joyous\r\nas ever. On the 27th the comedy of _The Captives_ was acted, and the\r\nperformance went off very well. To-day _The Merchant_ is to be given,\r\nand will, I hope, prove equally successful. To-morrow we are to have a\r\nthird. Our way of living is as follows. Early in the morning we go out\r\nriding. After dinner we play at _scartino_, or else at 'raising dead\r\nmen' and '_l'imperiale_,' and other card games, till it is bed-time. The\r\nplayers are, as a rule, the Duke and Duchess of Bari together, Ambrogio\r\nda Corte, and some third man, whoever may happen to be present. To-day\r\nyour father the duke, Don Alfonso, and Messer Galeaz Visconti are\r\nplaying at pall-mall against Messer Galeaz Sanseverino, Signor Girolamo\r\nTuttavilla, and myself. The Duchess of Milan does not join us in these\r\ngames, and only appears at the theatricals. The Duke of Bari is more\r\ndevoted to the duchess than ever, and is constantly caressing and\r\nembracing her. My lord your father is altogether intent on the comedies.\r\nWhen they are ended, hunting-parties will begin, and we shall all be\r\nready for the quails.\"\r\n\r\nThese amusements were unexpectedly interrupted by the news of Duchess\r\nLeonora's serious illness, a gastric affection which ended fatally on\r\nthe 11th of October. The death of this virtuous and admirable lady was\r\ndeeply lamented both by the members of her immediate family circle and\r\nby the subjects to whom she had endeared herself by her goodness of\r\nheart. Funeral orations in her honour were delivered both at Mantua and\r\nMilan, and Ariosto pronounced a panegyric in verse over her grave. The\r\nyoung Duchess Beatrice, who had been with her mother at Venice so\r\nlately, wept bitter tears, and for several weeks could scarcely be\r\npersuaded to leave her room. Some anxiety was felt respecting her sister\r\nIsabella, who, after being married for three years, was now expecting\r\nthe birth of her first child, and during ten days the news was concealed\r\nfrom her. But by the end of that time the Marchesa began to be uneasy,\r\nand to inquire why she received no letter from Ferrara. Soon the sad\r\nnews reached her from Milan, \"whether out of mere imprudence or by some\r\nmalicious design, we cannot discover,\" wrote one of her ladies to the\r\nabsent marquis. Isabella, however, showed her usual prudence and\r\nself-control. After the first burst of grief, she bore her loss with\r\nfortitude, and found distraction in putting herself, her rooms, and her\r\nhousehold into mourning. In her anxiety to appear elegant, even in her\r\ngrief, we find her asking Beatrice to send her some of the white lawn\r\nveils that were made in Milan, since she could find none to her taste in\r\nMantua. And at the same time, she begged one of her friends at the\r\nMilanese court to give her minute details as to the colour and material\r\nof the mourning worn by the duchess. On the 25th of October, her\r\ncorrespondent replied--\r\n\r\n\"Although I have not yet been able to see the Duchess of Bari, since she\r\nstill remains entirely in her room, yet, in order to satisfy your\r\nHighness, I have made inquiries as to the kind of mourning that she\r\nwears. Her Excellency is clad in a robe of black cloth, with sleeves of\r\nthe same, and a very long mantle, also of black cloth, and wears on her\r\nhead a black silk cap with muslin folds, which are neither grey nor\r\nyellow, but pure white. She hardly ever leaves her room, and Signor\r\nLodovico spends most of his time with her, and they two and Messer\r\nGaleaz have their meals alone in their rooms.\"[45]\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, Beatrice roused herself from her grief to help her\r\nhusband in the preparations for his niece Bianca Sforza's wedding to the\r\nEmperor Maximilian. The death of the old Emperor Frederic III., who\r\nbreathed his last at Linz on the 19th of August, and the elevation of\r\nhis son to the imperial throne, had hastened the development of\r\nLodovico's plans. The King of the Romans, as he was still called, until\r\nhe could be solemnly invested with the imperial insignia, now proposed\r\nto send ambassadors to Milan, before the end of the year, to solemnize\r\nhis espousals with the Princess Bianca and bring his bride across the\r\nAlps to Innsbrück. The date of the wedding was fixed for the last week\r\nin November, and Lodovico prepared to celebrate the event with fitting\r\nsplendour. The widowed Duchess Bona was transported with joy at the\r\nprospect of this exalted alliance, and forgave the Moro all his sins in\r\nher delight at seeing her daughter become an empress. On her part,\r\nBeatrice prepared to lay aside her mourning for the occasion, and appear\r\nin a new and wonderful robe at her niece's wedding.\r\n\r\nAccordingly she wrote to Isabella on the 12th of November, asking her\r\nsister's leave to make use of a design for a new _camora_, which had\r\nbeen suggested by Niccolo da Correggio.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot remember if your Highness has yet carried out the idea of that\r\npattern of linked tracery which Messer Niccolo da Correggio suggested to\r\nyou when we were last together. If you have not yet ordered the\r\nexecution of this design, I am thinking of having his invention carried\r\nout in massive gold, on a _camora_ of purple velvet, to wear on the day\r\nof Madonna Bianca's wedding, since my husband desires the whole court to\r\nlay aside mourning for that one day and to appear in colours. This being\r\nthe case, I cannot refrain from wearing colours on this occasion,\r\nalthough the heavy loss we have had in our dear mother's death has left\r\nme with little care for new inventions. But since this is necessary, I\r\nhave decided to make a trial of this pattern, if your Highness has not\r\nyet made use of it, and send the present courier, begging you not to\r\ndetain him, but to let me know at once if you have yet tried this new\r\ndesign or not.\"[46]\r\n\r\nThe courier to Mantua brought back word that the marchioness had not yet\r\nmade use of Niccolo's invention, and begged that her sister would feel\r\nherself at liberty to adopt the idea and \"satisfy her appetite.\"\r\nBeatrice ordered the _camora_ to be put in hand without delay, and\r\nMesser Niccolo had the satisfaction of seeing the duchess appear in this\r\nrobe at the imperial wedding. The subject is of special interest,\r\nbecause this same pattern is repeated in the sleeves of Ambrogio de\r\nPredis' portrait of Lodovico's fair young daughter Bianca, which must\r\nhave been painted about this time, and was probably adopted at the wish\r\nof Beatrice, who was fondly attached to her youthful step-daughter.\r\nAgain, this same linked tracery or \"_fantasia dei vinci_,\" as it is\r\ncalled in Beatrice and her sister's letters, is to be seen both in the\r\ndecorations that adorn the ceiling of a hall in the Castello of Milan,\r\nand on the vaulting of the sacristy in St. Maria delle Grazie. And as\r\nMr. Müntz[47] has lately pointed out, this same interlaced ornament, or\r\n_vinci_, in which the Belgian professor, M. Errera, sees a play upon the\r\ngreat painter's name, forms the motive of the famous circular engravings\r\nbearing the words \"_Academia Leonardi Vinci_,\" which have given rise to\r\nso many conjectures as to the existence of that mysterious institution.\r\nAll these repetitions of the pattern invented by Niccolo da Correggio,\r\nand adopted by Beatrice d'Este for her wedding robe, show how\r\nfashionable the _fantasia dei vinci_ became at the Milanese court, and\r\nlead us to imagine that Leonardo himself may have had some part in the\r\noriginal design.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of November, Lodovico wrote a note to Vigevano, where he and\r\nBeatrice had retired after Duchess Leonora's death, informing his\r\nfather-in-law that he was on the point of returning to Milan to receive\r\nthe imperial ambassadors, Gaspar Melchior, Bishop of Brixen, and Jean\r\nBontemps. These important personages arrived on the 7th, and were met by\r\nLodovico and his nephew, the Duke of Milan, at the Porta Orientale,\r\nopposite the newly erected Lazzaretto, and conducted in state to their\r\nrooms in the Castello. Here the German envoys were loaded with gifts,\r\nand magnificently entertained during the next three weeks. The nuptial\r\nceremony was put off a week, to allow time for the arrival of the\r\nspecial envoys whom at the last moment Charles VIII. had decided to\r\nsend, to do homage to his allies, and finally took place on St.\r\nAndrew's festival, the 30th of November, in the Duomo of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe street decorations on this occasion surpassed anything which had\r\nbeen seen before; the doors and windows were wreathed with ivy, laurel,\r\nand myrtle boughs, and the walls hung with tapestries and brocades\r\nembroidered with the armorial bearings of the different royal houses\r\nconnected with the Sforza family. The adder of the Visconti, the cross\r\nof Savoy, and the imperial eagle were seen side by side with the\r\nmulberry-tree and other favourite devices of the Moro and his race,\r\nwhile all manner of strange and fantastic emblems were introduced by\r\nprivate owners, and one house exhibited the effigy of a crocodile, \"a\r\ncreature never before seen,\" remarks the historian, Tristan Calco, \"in\r\nour city.\" But the most striking feature of the whole was the triumphal\r\narch erected on the piazza in front of the Castello, and, by Lodovico's\r\norders, crowned with Leonardo's model for the colossal equestrian statue\r\nof the great captain, Francesco Sforza. This clay horse, to which the\r\nFlorentine master had devoted so many years of arduous labour, and which\r\nhad cost him such infinite thought and care, was now at length\r\ncompleted, and the Milanese poets with one voice celebrated the praise\r\nof Lodovico, who had ordered the work,--\r\n\r\n    \"Per memoria del padre un gran colosso;\"\r\n\r\nand the fame of Leonardo, whose rare genius had produced this unrivalled\r\nstatue--\r\n\r\n    \"Guarde pur come è bello quel cavallo\r\n    Leonardo Vinci a farli sol s'è mosso\r\n    Statura bon pictore, e bon geometra\r\n    Un tanto ingegno rar dal ciel s'impetra.\"\r\n\r\nSo Baldassare Taccone sang in his poem on Bianca's wedding, while a\r\ngreater scholar, Lancinus Curtius, recorded the completion of the\r\nlong-expected work in the following epigram:--\r\n\r\n    \"Expectant animi, molemque futuram\r\n    Suspiciunt; fluat æs; vox erit: Ecce deus!\"\r\n\r\nThe court poet Taccone waxes eloquent over the splendour of the\r\nprocession, led by Messer Galeazzo, captain-general of the armies, and\r\nthe beauty of the bride, whose tall and slender figure showed to\r\nadvantage in her gorgeous apparel, with her long fair hair flowing over\r\nher shoulders, as she rode through the streets bowing in response to the\r\nenthusiastic cheers of the crowd. He paints the marvellous scene inside\r\nthe Duomo, where the venerable Archbishop of Milan sang mass in the\r\npresence of the most brilliant assembly ever seen within its walls, and\r\nthe firing of guns and ringing of bells marked the moment when the\r\nBishop of Brixen placed the imperial crown on the bride's head. Taccone\r\ndescribes the glittering array of chandeliers and vases, designed after\r\nSignor Lodovico's favourite antique fashion, which adorned the high\r\naltar, the blaze of a thousand wax lights which illumined the majestic\r\nchoir, the sweet perfumes of incense and celestial harmonies of the\r\nmusic that filled the air. And, like a true courtier, he contrives to\r\nmake everything, decorations, music, and processions, redound to the\r\npraise of the great Moro, the author of all the glories of Milan.\r\n\r\nBut we have an equally minute and perhaps more interesting description\r\nof the scene from Beatrice's own pen, in a letter which she sent to her\r\nsister Isabella from Vigevano on the 29th of December. The marchioness,\r\nwhose state of health prevented her from being present on the important\r\noccasion, had begged her sister to send her full accounts of the\r\nceremony, but, owing to the _fêtes_ which followed the wedding and the\r\njourney of the court as far as Como with the imperial bride, a whole\r\nmonth elapsed before Beatrice was able to fulfil her promise.\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LADY AND DEAREST SISTER,\r\n\r\n\"I told you some time ago that I would let you have a full account of\r\nthe triumphant display held in Milan, at the marriage of her Most Serene\r\nHighness the Queen of the Romans, and I certainly desired the chancellor\r\nto send you this account. But since you write that it has never reached\r\nyou, the fault must rest with the said chancellor, and you must excuse\r\nme for this apparent neglect.\r\n\r\n\"On the last day of the past month the nuptials took place, and in\r\npreparation for this solemnity, a portico was erected in front of the\r\nChiesa Maggiore of the city of Milan, with pillars on either side,\r\nsupporting a purple canopy, embroidered with doves. Within the church,\r\nthe aisles were hung with brocade as far as the choir, in front of which\r\na triumphal arch had been erected on massive pillars. This was entirely\r\npainted, and bore in the centre an effigy of Duke Francesco on\r\nhorseback, in his ducal robes, with the ducal arms and those of the King\r\nof the Romans above. This triumphal arch was square in shape, and\r\nornamented with pictures of antique feasts, and the imperial insignia\r\nand the arms of my husband were placed on the side towards the high\r\naltar. Beyond this arch were steps that led up to a great tribunal\r\nerected in front of the high altar. On the left was a small tribunal\r\nfrom which the Gospel was sung, hung with gold brocade; on the right was\r\nanother, adorned with silver brocade; and behind these tribunals were\r\nseats ranged in order and covered with draperies, for the councillors\r\nand other feudatories and gentlemen. In the extreme corners of the choir\r\nwere two raised stages, one for the singers, the other for the\r\ntrumpeters, and in the space between were seated the doctors of law and\r\nmedicine, with their birettas and capes lined with fur, each according\r\nto his rank. The altar itself was sumptuously adorned with all the\r\nsilver vases and images of saints which you saw in the Rocchetta when\r\nyou were at Milan.\r\n\r\n\"The street leading to the Duomo was beautifully decorated. There were\r\ncolumns wreathed with ivy all the way from the bastions of the Castello\r\nto the end of the piazza, and between the columns were festoons of\r\nboughs bearing antique devices, and round shields with the imperial arms\r\nand those of our house, and Sforzesca draperies were hung above the\r\nstreet all the way from the Castello to the Duomo. Many of the doors had\r\ntheir pillars wreathed with ivy and green boughs, so that the season\r\nseemed to be May-time rather than November. On both sides of the street,\r\nthe walls were hung with satin, excepting those houses which have lately\r\nbeen adorned with frescoes, and which are no less beautiful than\r\ntapestries.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of the day, at about nine o'clock, the reverend and\r\nmagnificent ambassadors of the King of the Romans rode to the church,\r\nhonourably attended by the Marchese Ermes, the Count of Caiazzo, Count\r\nFrancesco Sforza, the Count of Melzo, and Messer Lodovico da Fojano, and\r\ntook their seats on the grand tribunal, close to the small tribunal\r\ncovered with cloth of gold, on the left as you go in, this being counted\r\nthe most honourable place, as it is the Gospel side. At ten o'clock, her\r\nserene Highness the Queen ascended the triumphal car which our dearest\r\nmother of blessed memory gave me when I was at Ferrara, and which was\r\ndrawn on this occasion by four snow-white horses. The queen wore a vest\r\nof crimson satin, embroidered in gold thread and covered with jewels.\r\nHer train was immensely long, and the sleeves were made to look like two\r\nwings, which had a very fine appearance. On her head she wore an\r\nornament of magnificent diamonds and pearls. And to add to the solemnity\r\nof the occasion, Messer Galeazzo Pallavicino carried the train, and\r\nCount Conrado de' Lando and Count Manfredo Torniello each of them\r\nsupported one of the sleeves. Before the bride walked all the\r\nchamberlains, courtiers, officials, gentlemen, feudatories, and last of\r\nall the councillors. The queen seated herself in the centre of the car,\r\nthe Duchess Isabella being on her right, and myself on her left. The\r\nsaid duchess wore a _camora_ of crimson satin, with gold cords looped\r\nover it, as in my grey cloth _camora_, which you must remember; and I\r\nwore my purple velvet _camora_, with the pattern of the links worked in\r\nmassive gold and green and white enamel, about six inches deep on the\r\nfront and back of my bodice, and on both sleeves. The _camora_ was lined\r\nwith cloth of gold, and with it I wore a girdle of St. Francis made of\r\nlarge pearls, with a beautiful clear-cut ruby for clasp. On the other\r\nside of the chariot were Madonna Fiordelisa\"--an illegitimate daughter\r\nof Duke Francesco Sforza, who occupied rooms in the Castello,--\"Madonna\r\nBianca, the wife of Messer Galeazzo; and the wife of Count Francesco\r\nSforza. The chariot was followed by the ambassadors who have been sent\r\nby his Most Christian Majesty of France to honour these nuptials, and\r\nafter them came the envoys of the different Italian powers, according to\r\ntheir rank, then the lord duke and my husband on horseback. These were\r\nfollowed by about twelve chariots containing the noblest maidens of\r\nMilan, who had been especially chosen and invited to attend the\r\nsolemnity, and the ladies of the queen, all wearing the same livery,\r\nwith tan-coloured _camoras_ and mantles of bright green satin. Both the\r\nDuchess Isabella's ladies and mine were riding in these chariots. And as\r\nwe drove to the Duomo in this procession, all the shops and windows on\r\nthe road were hung with satin draperies and filled with men and women,\r\nand it was impossible to count the crowds of people who thronged every\r\npart of the streets.\r\n\r\n\"When we reached the gates of the Duomo, we alighted from the chariots\r\nand found Madonna Beatrice waiting to receive the bride, with a number\r\nof noble ladies, and we proceeded as far as the steps of the tribunal,\r\nwhere the ambassadors of the King of the Romans advanced to meet the\r\nqueen, whom they conducted to her place on the great tribunal in front\r\nof the high altar. Then we all took our proper places--that is to say,\r\nthe ambassadors mounted the tribunal covered with cloth of gold, the\r\nqueen was led to the tribunal of silver brocade, between the French\r\nambassadors, while behind them were seated the envoys of the other\r\npowers, the duke and my husband, Duchess Isabella and myself. The other\r\nhonourable relatives of the bride occupied a lower range of seats, and\r\nthe central part of the tribunal was filled with a large number of\r\nladies. On the queen's side, the councillors, feudatories, and other\r\ncourtiers, officials, and chamberlains occupied the remainder of the\r\nseats. As for the rest of the people, the church, which is a very large\r\none, could not contain them all.\r\n\r\n\"When we were all in our places, the Most Reverend Archbishop of Milan\r\nentered in full vestments, with the priests in ordinary, and began to\r\ncelebrate mass with the greatest pomp and solemnity, to the sound of\r\ntrumpets, flutes, and organ-music, together with the voices of the\r\nchapel choir, who adapted their singing to Monsignore's time. At the\r\nsinging of the Gospel, two of the priests in ordinary of the cathedral\r\nbore the incense, the one to the ambassadors of the King Maximilian, and\r\nthe other to the queen, the duke and duchess, and my husband and myself,\r\nwho were opposite. The Pax was given, when the right time came, by the\r\nBishop of Piacenza to the king's representatives, and to us others who\r\nsat on the other tribunal by the Bishop of Como. After mass had been\r\ncelebrated with the greatest solemnity, the queen rose from her place\r\nbetween the ambassadors of his Most Christian Majesty, and, accompanied\r\nby the duke and my husband, Duchess Isabella and myself, and followed by\r\nall the princes of the blood, advanced to the altar. The ambassadors of\r\nKing Maximilian advanced on their side, and we all stood before the\r\naltar, where Monsignore the Archbishop pronounced the marriage service,\r\nand the Bishop of Brixen first gave the ring to the queen, and then,\r\nassisted by the archbishop, placed on her head the crown, which act was\r\naccompanied with great blowing of trumpets, ringing of bells, and firing\r\nof guns and shells. And the said crown was of gold, enriched with\r\nrubies, pearls, and diamonds, set in the form of arches meeting in the\r\nshape of a cross, and on the top of all was a figure of the globe,\r\ncrowned with a small imperial cross, after the pattern given by the\r\nambassadors, in obedience to the king's directions.\r\n\r\n\"After this, every one walked in procession to the gates of the Duomo,\r\nthe above-named feudatories bearing the train and sleeves. Then the\r\nwomen, as well as the men, mounted horses, and a _baldacchino_ of white\r\ndamask lined with ermine was prepared, under which the queen rode,\r\npreceded by the ambassadors and the whole court, with the duke and my\r\nhusband at their head. Next to the queen rode the ambassadors of her\r\nhusband the king, the Bishop of Brixen being on the left hand, outside\r\nthe _baldacchino_, and so the long procession moved towards the\r\nCastello. All the clergy of the city of Milan, richly apparelled and\r\nvery devout in appearance, were drawn up between the Castello and Duomo,\r\nboth on the way thither and on the return journey. Messer Zoan Francesco\r\nPallavicino and Messer Francesco Bernardo Visconti acted as the queen's\r\nstaff-bearers, from the Duomo to the Castello. The _baldacchino_ was\r\ncarried all the way by doctors robed in the manner described above, and\r\nbehind the queen rode the duchess and myself, followed by the relatives,\r\ncourtiers, and invited guests, all on horseback. Then came the ladies of\r\nthe queen, those of the duchess, and my own, all sumptuously clad and\r\nmaking a splendid show, and finest of all was the queen, with the\r\nimperial crown on her head. Nothing but gold and silver brocade was to\r\nbe seen, and the least well-dressed persons wore crimson velvet, so that\r\nthe costumes were a marvellous sight, besides the infinite number of\r\ngold chains worn by knights and others. All those who were present\r\nagreed that they had never seen so glorious a spectacle. And the\r\nambassador of Russia, who was among the spectators, declared that he had\r\nnever seen such extraordinary pomp. The nuncio of His Holiness the Pope\r\nsaid the same, as well as the French ambassador, who declared that,\r\nalthough he had been present at the Pope's coronation and at that of his\r\nown king and queen, he had never seen as splendid a sight. Your Highness\r\nmay judge from this how full of pleasure and glory these nuptials have\r\nbeen. All the people shouted for joy, and so at length we reached the\r\nCastello of Milan, where the procession broke up and the crowd\r\ndispersed. I wished for your presence many times during the whole\r\nceremony, but since this desire of mine could not be satisfied, I\r\nthought I would give you this account with my own hand. Commending\r\nmyself to your Highness as ever,\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your sister,\r\n                   BEATRIX SFORTIA VICECOMES ESTENSIS DUCHISA BRI.[48]\r\n\r\nVigevano, December 29, 1493.\r\n\r\nTo my illustrious lady and most dear sister the lady Isabella di\r\nGonzaga Estensis, Marchionissæ Mantuæ.\"\r\n\r\nThe splendours which Beatrice describes with so much enthusiasm did not\r\nend with the bride's return to the Castello. Here Bianca's magnificent\r\ntrousseau was exhibited before the admiring eyes of the ladies of Milan.\r\nIt was valued at 100,000 ducats, and included not only rich clothes and\r\ncostly jewels, but gold and silver plate for use in the royal chapel and\r\non the dinner-table, altar fittings and bed-hangings, mirrors and\r\nperfumes, and a vast store of fine linen, carpets, saddles and\r\nhorse-trappings of the most sumptuous description. The court poet goes\r\non to tell how Duchess Bona welcomed her daughter with tears of joy, and\r\nhow during the next two days high festival was held in the Castello.\r\nThere was a tournament, in which the \"gran Sanseverini\" once more proved\r\ntheir valour, and Messer Galeaz as usual bore off the prize, followed\r\nby much feasting and dancing, and a grand display of fireworks. \"So many\r\ntorches and lights illumined the darkness of night, that all Milan\r\nblazed as if the city were on fire.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the marriage ceremony, the queen started on her\r\njourney across the Alps, attended by Maximilian's ambassadors and a\r\nnumerous suite, which included her brother, Ermes Sforza; her cousin,\r\nFrancesco Sforza; the Archbishop of Milan; the poet Gaspare Visconti;\r\nand the great jurist Giasone del Maino, as well as Erasmo Brasca, who\r\nwas to resume his post of envoy to the King of the Romans. The Duke and\r\nDuchess of Milan, Lodovico and Beatrice, and Bona of Savoy all\r\naccompanied Bianca as far as Como, where the bishop and clergy came out\r\nto meet her, and conducted her in state to the cathedral. After a solemn\r\nthanksgiving service, at which all the court assisted, the queen and the\r\nGerman ambassadors spent the night in the episcopal palace, while the\r\nother princes and princesses were entertained in the houses of\r\ndistinguished courtiers in the town. On the following morning the bride\r\ntook leave of her family, and embarked on a richly decorated barge\r\nfitted out by the royal citizens of Torno and rowed by forty sailors,\r\nwhile her suite followed in thirty smaller boats, painted and decked out\r\nwith laurel boughs and tapestries. Niccolo da Correggio, whose daughter\r\nLeonora was one of the ladies chosen to accompany Bianca on her journey,\r\nhas described the beauty of the scene that morning, the blue waters of\r\nthe lake covered with glittering sails, the shores crowded with people\r\nin holiday attire, and the joyous sounds of music that filled the air as\r\nthe gay _cortége_ left Como. The bridal party reached Bellagio in\r\nsafety, and after spending the night at the Marchesino Stanga's castle,\r\nstarted on their journey towards the upper end of the lake. But hardly\r\nhad they left the shore, than the weather changed and a violent storm\r\nscattered the fleet in all directions. The poor young queen and her\r\nladies wept and cried aloud to God for mercy, and their companions were\r\nscarcely less terrified. Only Giasone del Maino preserved his composure\r\nand smiled at the terror of the courtiers, who gave themselves up for\r\nlost, while he exhorted the frightened boatmen to keep their heads.\r\nFortunately, towards nightfall the tempest subsided, and after tossing\r\non the waves for several hours, the queen's barge with part of the fleet\r\nmanaged to put back into Bellagio. The next day a more prosperous start\r\nwas made, and on the 8th of December the party set off on horseback to\r\ncross the mountain passes. But the hardships of the journey were not yet\r\nover. A rough mule-track was the only road that led in those days over\r\nthe Alps that divided the Valtellina from the Tyrol, \"that fearful and\r\ncruel mountain of Nombray,\" as the Venetian chronicler calls the pass\r\nnow crossed by the Stelvio road. No wonder the sight of those\r\nprecipitous cliffs filled the Milanese ladies with terror, and they\r\nshrank from exploring such barbarous regions in the depth of winter. One\r\nmaid of honour had to be left behind at Gravedona, unable to bear the\r\nfatigues of the journey, and Bianca herself complained bitterly to\r\nErasmo Brasca of the hardships which she had to endure. \"The queen,\"\r\nwrote the ambassador to Lodovico, \"conducts herself well on the whole,\r\nbut often complains that I deceive her, by telling her, each morning\r\nwhen she mounts her horse, that she will not find the road so rough\r\nto-day, and then, as ill luck will have it, it turns out to be worse\r\nthan ever.\" At length, however, on the 23rd of December, the travellers\r\nreached Innsbrück, and Bianca was kindly received by Maximilian's uncle,\r\nthe Archduke Sigismund of Austria, and his wife, with whom she spent\r\nChristmas and beguiled the winter days with dancing and games, while\r\nErasmo Brasca went on to meet the King of the Romans at Vienna. Even\r\nthen some weeks passed before this laggard bridegroom joined his newly\r\nwedded wife, and Erasmo Brasca's mind was sorely perturbed at his\r\nprolonged delays and excuses. Bianca, however, whose childish mind was\r\neasily distracted, found plenty of amusement in her new surroundings and\r\nwrote long and affectionate letters to her uncle Lodovico, telling him\r\nhow she and the Archduchess Barbara had been dressing up their ladies _à\r\nla Tedesca_ and _à la Lombarda_, and how the court painter, Ambrogio de\r\nPredis, who had accompanied her from Milan to paint Maximilian's\r\nportrait, had just made a picture of the archduchess, which greatly\r\npleased her. And she informs her uncle that the German princess had sent\r\nto ask her for a portrait of Signor Lodovico, which she had been very\r\nanxious to see and had studied with the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the 9th of March, Maximilian arrived at the castle of Hall,\r\nwhere his bride met him, and the marriage was at length consummated, \"to\r\nthe confusion of all our enemies,\" as Brasca wrote triumphantly to his\r\nmaster on the following morning. This union, in which Lodovico's friends\r\nand foes alike acknowledged a master-stroke of successful diplomacy, was\r\nnot destined to prove a very happy one. From the first Maximilian looked\r\nwith critical eyes on this bride of twenty-one, who was thirteen years\r\nyounger than himself, and told Erasmo Brasca that Bianca was quite as\r\nfair as his first wife, Mary of Burgundy, but inferior in wisdom and\r\ngood sense to that princess, adding that perhaps she might improve in\r\ntime. He treated her kindly to begin with, and gratified her by the\r\nhandsome robes which he gave her in order that she might appear attired\r\nin German fashion at her coronation. Before long, however, he began to\r\nfind fault with her extravagant habits, and complained that she had\r\nspent 2000 florins, presented to her by the city of Cologne, in one\r\nsingle day. Brasca himself felt obliged to remonstrate with her on her\r\nfoolish tricks, especially for eating her meals on the floor instead of\r\nat table, and other bad habits which annoyed the emperor, while the\r\nviolent friendship which she made with one of her ladies, Violante by\r\nname, led to continual intrigues and quarrels. Maximilian soon began to\r\nfind her presence wearisome, and to leave her mostly to herself, and\r\nwhen he found that his hopes of an heir did not seem likely to be\r\nrealized, he allowed the poor empress to lead a very dull and solitary\r\nlife. Left alone, as she often was for weeks, in the vast, gloomy castle\r\nof Innsbrück, Bianca pined for the bright and sunny villas and palaces\r\nof Milan, and looked back sadly on the gay years of her old life. She\r\nwas constantly writing affectionate letters to her uncle, asking him to\r\ngive places and pensions to her old friends and servants in Milan, and\r\nbegging him for portraits of himself and Beatrice, as well as for the\r\nsilks and feathers, the jewels and perfumes, with which her thoughts\r\nwere always busy.[49]\r\n\r\nBut, to do her justice, she proved a loyal friend to Lodovico in his\r\ndarkest days, and when his children lived in exile at Innsbrück, they\r\nfound a kind and loving protector in the empress during the few\r\nremaining years of her life. From the year after her marriage her health\r\nbegan to droop, and she became gradually weaker, until in 1510 she died\r\nof this lingering illness, and was buried in the Franciscan church of\r\nInnsbrück, where the bronze effigy of Maximilian's Lombard bride, robed\r\nin the rich brocades which she loved so well, still adorns his sumptuous\r\nmausoleum.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] Luzio-Renier. _op. cit._, pp. 380-382.\r\n\r\n[46] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 383.\r\n\r\n[47] \"Leonardo da Vinci,\" by Eugène Müntz, vol. i. p. 226.\r\n\r\n[48] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 388.\r\n\r\n[49] F.

The promise of the investiture of Milan, which he had received\r\nfrom the emperor, soon became known; it was freely discussed that autumn\r\nboth in Rome and Venice, and gave Alfonso of Calabria good reason to\r\ntake up arms in defence of his son-in-law Gian Galeazzo's rights. But\r\nKing Ferrante still hesitated to declare war against Milan, and, while\r\nhe raised forces and made preparations for the defence of his dominions,\r\nwas far more concerned to detach Lodovico from the French alliance than\r\nto interfere in the domestic affairs of Milan on behalf of his\r\ngranddaughter and her husband. In August he succeeded in making peace\r\nwith Pope Alexander, and even consented to a marriage contract between\r\nhis granddaughter Sancia, and Godfrey Borgia, the Pope's young son. This\r\nnew departure alarmed Lodovico seriously, and produced a marked\r\nalteration in his foreign policy. When Charles the Eighth's envoy,\r\nPerron de' Baschi, visited Milan in June, he met with polite but vague\r\nanswers from the Moro, and received no distinct promise of support in\r\nthe conquest of Naples. But early in September, Count Belgiojoso\r\nreturned to France, and lost no time in seeking an interview with the\r\nking. \"Is your Majesty going to undertake the expedition or not?\" were\r\nhis first words. \"Signor Lodovico is anxious to learn your intention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already told Signor Lodovico my intentions a thousand times\r\nover, by envoys and letters,\" replied the king, petulantly, and\r\nproceeded to intimate that if the Moro played him false, he would\r\nsupport the Duke of Orleans in reviving his old claims on the Milanese.\r\nBelgiojoso hastened to assure Charles of his master's friendly\r\nsentiments, upon which the king's ill temper mollified, and he said,\r\n\"Then I will regard him as a father, and seek his advice in everything.\"\r\n\r\nAll the same, when Charles repeated his request that Lodovico should\r\nsend him Messer Galeazzo, and expressed his great wish to see the hero\r\nof so many tournaments in person, the Moro once more gave an evasive\r\nanswer, and told Belgiojoso that he could not spare his son-in-law at\r\npresent. The Pope showed his friendliness to the house of Este by\r\nincluding Beatrice's brother Ippolito, a lad of fifteen, among the\r\ntwelve cardinals whom he created that September, his own son, Cesar\r\nBorgia, being another of the number. In November he sent Lodovico his\r\ncordial congratulations on his niece's marriage with the emperor, and\r\npresented Maximilian with a consecrated sword.\r\n\r\n\"This is the state of affairs in Italy at present,\" wrote the chronicler\r\nMalipiero on the 25th of September, 1493. \"The Pope is in league with\r\nLodovico of Milan. Maximilian, King of the Romans, has been elected\r\nemperor, and has taken Bianca Sforza to wife with 400,000 ducats, and\r\nLodovico is to be invested with the duchy of Milan by him as emperor. At\r\nRome Cardinal Ascanio's affairs prosper, and Lodovico of Milan is on\r\nintimate terms with the Pope and all of his allies. And Duke Ercole has\r\nsent his son Alfonso to France to tell King Charles that his troops will\r\nhave free passage to Naples through his dominions, because he is the\r\nfather-in-law of Lodovico.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, old King Ferrante, becoming desperate, made a\r\nlast effort to win over Lodovico to his side, and implored him to use\r\nhis influence to stop the French monarch, warning him that the tide of\r\nevents might in the end prove too strong for him. \"The time will come,\"\r\nreplied Lodovico proudly, \"when all Italy will turn to me and pray to be\r\ndelivered from the coming evils.\" In his anxiety to recover the Moro's\r\nfriendship, the old king even thought of coming to Genoa himself to meet\r\nhis granddaughter's husband, and arrive at some agreement. But early in\r\nthe new year he fell ill, and died of fever on the 25th of January, at\r\nthe age of seventy.\r\n\r\nThe death of Ferrante and accession of his son Alfonso, the father of\r\nDuchess Isabella, and a personal enemy of the Moro, brought matters to a\r\ncrisis. The old king could never conquer his dislike of the Pope, and\r\nhad only given a reluctant consent to the proposed marriage of his\r\ngranddaughter with a Borgia. Alfonso, on the contrary, was ready to\r\nagree to any terms which might conciliate Alexander VI., and employed\r\nevery artifice to obtain the Pope's support, and that of Piero de'\r\nMedici against France and Milan. In spite of the compliments that were\r\nexchanged on both sides upon his accession, Alfonso's enmity to Lodovico\r\nSforza was well known at Naples, and the Milanese ambassador, Antonio\r\nStanga, warned Lodovico to beware of assassins and prisoners, since, to\r\nhis certain knowledge, the \"new king has paid large sums of money to\r\nseveral Neapolitans of bad repute, who have been sent to Milan on some\r\nevil errand.\" After much vacillation on the Pope's part, and prolonged\r\nnegotiations with both France and Naples, he was induced by the Orsini,\r\nwho were staunch allies of the house of Aragon, to grant Alfonso the\r\ninvestiture of Naples, and to send his son, Cardinal Juan Borgia, to\r\nofficiate at his coronation. A papal bull was addressed to Charles\r\nVIII., warning him not to invade Italy at the peril of his soul, and\r\nCardinal Ascanio Sforza, whose influence had been hitherto all-powerful\r\nwith the Pope, left the Vatican and retired to his own palace. The\r\nPope's change of front finally determined Lodovico's policy. From this\r\nmoment he threw himself heart and soul into the alliance with France,\r\nand left no stone unturned to bring Charles VIII. into Italy. In an\r\nimportant letter which, on the 10th of March, he addressed to his\r\nbrother, Cardinal Ascanio, who shared all his secrets, he reminds him\r\nthat he had originally been no friend to the French invasion.\r\n\r\n\"It is not true,\" he writes, \"that the whole movement proceeds from me.\r\nIt was the Most Christian King who took the initiative, which is proved\r\nby the appeal for the investiture of Naples, which he addressed to the\r\nlate Pope Innocent, and also by many letters written on the subject by\r\nour own hand. When the Treaty of Senlis was signed, he sent his envoy to\r\ntell me that he meant to invade Italy. At that moment, seeing how badly\r\nthe King of Naples had behaved against the Holy Father, I was not sorry\r\nto come to the help of His Holiness. I ceased to dissuade the Most\r\nChristian King from the enterprise. I approved his resolution, and now\r\nhe is at Lyons.\"\r\n\r\nAs late as the 6th of February, Lodovico had again declined to send\r\nMesser Galeazzo to France, saying that every one would think he had come\r\nto hasten the king's movements, and that in this way Charles would lose\r\nthe honour of the campaign. But when the news of the alliance between\r\nAlfonso and the Pope reached him, he made no further difficulties, and\r\non the 1st of April, Galeazzo started for Lyons. On the 5th, he entered\r\nthe town secretly, disguised as a German, and, accompanied only by four\r\nriders, made his way to the royal lodgings, and saw the king privately,\r\nthis being the day which had been selected by Lodovico's astrologer,\r\nAmbrogio da Rosate, for his arrival at court. On the following morning\r\nhe made his public entry, attended by a suite of a hundred horsemen clad\r\nin the French fashion, which Messer Galeazzo himself commonly affected.\r\nThe king received him with the utmost cordiality, and conducted him\r\nimmediately to see the queen, whom he presented with a magnificent\r\nSpanish robe in Lodovico's name, together with choice specimens of\r\nMilanese armour, jennets from his own famous breed, and several handsome\r\nsilver flagons filled with fragrant perfumes, in which Charles took\r\nespecial delight. The French king fell an easy victim to this brilliant\r\ncavalier's personal charm. He insisted on seeing him ride in a tilting\r\nmatch before the court, and could talk of nothing but Messer Galeazzo's\r\nfeats of horsemanship, whether in council or at table, and even when he\r\nwent to bed. He bestowed the order of St. Michel upon his guest, and,\r\namong other marks of favour, he invited Galeazzo to his private rooms,\r\nwhere he sat with a few of his favourites, and, taking one of the\r\nfairest maidens by the hand, presented her to his visitor. Then the king\r\nhimself sat down by another, and so they remained for some hours in\r\npleasant conversation.\"\r\n\r\nIn his reply to Belgiojoso, who duly reported these events to his\r\nmaster, Lodovico dwells with infinite satisfaction on the great honours\r\nwhich have been paid to his dear son, and rejoices to hear that his\r\nMajesty has introduced him into his private apartments, and even shared\r\nhis domestic pleasures with him. The presence of Galeazzo di Sanseverino\r\nat Lyons had, no doubt, the effect of counteracting the intrigues of the\r\nDuke of Orleans and the Aragonese party at the French court, and the\r\nconfidence with which he inspired Charles dissipated any doubts which\r\nthe king may have entertained of Lodovico's honesty. \"The mission of\r\nSignor Galeazzo,\" wrote Belgiojoso, \"has been crowned with success.\r\nWithout his coming, the enterprise would have been utterly ruined.\"\r\n\r\nAnother and still more powerful advocate of the expedition now appeared\r\nat Lyons in the person of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, who, in\r\nGuicciardini's opinion, \"was the fatall instrument of all the miseries\r\nof Italy.\" This bitter enemy of the Borgias had been repeatedly\r\nthreatened with assassination by the Pope's creatures, and, feeling that\r\nOstia was no safe place for him, he embarked one night in a fisherman's\r\nbark and fled first to Savona and thence to Genoa. Here, with Lodovico's\r\nassistance, he managed to proceed on his journey to France, and on the\r\n1st of June reached Lyons, where his vehement invectives against the\r\nPope and urgent entreaties helped to hasten the king's preparations. At\r\nthe same time Erasmo Brasca, acting under Lodovico's orders, succeeded\r\nin disarming Maximilian's opposition to the French king's invasion of\r\nItaly, and wrote to his master on the 14th of June, informing him that\r\nthe French ambassador had just left Worms with an assurance from the\r\nemperor that he would not impede that monarch's designs upon Naples.\r\nWhen, ten days later, Galeazzo di Sanseverino returned to Milan, the die\r\nwas cast, and the French invasion of Italy was at length finally\r\ndetermined. Meanwhile the long-expected rupture between Milan and Naples\r\nhad taken place. On the 8th of May, Alfonso was crowned by the papal\r\nnuncio, Juan Borgia, after the marriage of the Princess Sancia to\r\nGodfrey Borgia had been solemnized on the previous day. A fortnight\r\nlater, as the king rode in state, accompanied by all the foreign\r\nambassadors, to church on the Feast of Corpus Christi, he took occasion\r\nto ask the Milanese envoy, Antonio Stanga, if the news which reached him\r\nfrom Lyons were true, and the French king's enterprise, after being\r\nalmost given up, had now been decided upon, owing to Messer Galeazzo's\r\nvisit. The ambassador listened deferentially, cap in hand, but\r\ncourteously disclaimed all knowledge of such information.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Signor Lodovico,\" returned the king, \"that he will be the first to\r\nrue the day when the French set foot in Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before I had time to reply,\" writes Stanga, \"the other ambassadors had\r\narrived to salute his Majesty, and I did not see him again alone.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later the Milanese envoy was abruptly dismissed, and war\r\ndeclared against Milan. Alfonso committed the first open act of\r\nhostilities by seizing Lodovico's principality of Bari. At the same time\r\na fleet was equipped to attack Genoa, and the land forces prepared to\r\njoin the papal army and march through Romagna against the Milanese.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1494, \"that most unhappie year for Italy,\" writes\r\nGuicciardini, \"for that in it was made open the way to infinite and\r\nhorrible calamities,\" was spent by Lodovico and his wife at their\r\nfavourite palace of Vigevano. After Bianca's wedding they had retired\r\nthere, to spend the remaining period of Beatrice's mourning at this\r\ncountry retreat, and did not leave until the spring was well advanced.\r\nFrom here Beatrice wrote on the 3rd of January to rejoice with her\r\nsister Isabella on the birth of her first child, a daughter, who\r\nreceived the name of Leonora, after their beloved mother. The duchess\r\ncongratulated her sister in affectionate terms, and signed herself,\r\n\"_Quella che desidera vedere la Signoria Vostra_.\" She who desires to\r\nsee your Highness,\r\n\r\n\"BEATRICE SFORZA D'ESTE.\"[50]\r\n\r\nBelow she added messages from her baby-boy: \"Ercole begs me to commend\r\nhim to your Highness, and to his new cousin.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Beatrice was the more cordial and warm in expressing her\r\naffection for her sister because of the difference that had lately\r\narisen between her husband and the marquis, who had lately been invited\r\nto take the command of the King of Naples' troops in the war against\r\nMilan. This offer he eventually declined, as well as an invitation from\r\nthe French king to enter his service; but on this and other occasions\r\nhis attitude excited Lodovico's displeasure, while the Moro's somewhat\r\nimperious request annoyed both Gianfrancesco and his wife. For one\r\nthing, Isabella could not forgive the way in which her brother-in-law\r\ndesired that fish from the lake of Garda should to sent to Milan at his\r\npleasure, and wrote to her husband on the 1st of February in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\r\n\r\n\"I am quite willing to see that fish should be sent to Milan\r\noccasionally, but not every week, as he requests in his imperious\r\nfashion, as if we were his feudatories, lest it should appear as if we\r\nwere compelled to send it, and it were a kind of tribute.\"\r\n\r\nBut although Beatrice's exalted position and the splendour of the\r\nMilanese court sometimes excited Isabella's envy, and Lodovico's\r\npretensions ruffled her equanimity, nothing ever disturbed the happy\r\nrelations between the sisters. Beatrice was always frank and generous in\r\nher behaviour to Isabella, and the marchioness remained sincerely\r\nattached to her, and in her letters to her beloved sister-in-law, the\r\nDuchess of Urbino, constantly assures her that she holds the next place\r\nin her heart to that occupied by her only sister, \"_la sorella mia\r\nunica, la Duchessa di Bari_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at Vigevano that winter, on the 28th of January, that Lodovico\r\ndrew up the deed of gift by which he endowed his wife with his palace\r\nlands of Cussago, as well as the Sforzesca and other lands in the\r\ndistrict of Novara and Pavia. The deed, signed with his own hand, and\r\nrichly illuminated by some excellent miniature painter of the Milanese\r\nschool, is preserved in the British Museum, and is an admirable example\r\nof contemporary Lombard art. Medallion portraits of Lodovico and\r\nBeatrice are painted on the vellum, together with a frieze of lovely\r\n_putti_, supporting their armorial bearings, and a variety of Sforza\r\ndevices and mottoes, interspersed with festoons of foliage and fruit,\r\ntorches and cornucopias. Lodovico's strongly marked features and long\r\ndark hair are relieved by the richness of his dark blue mantle sown with\r\ngold stars, while Beatrice wears a gold _ferronière_ on her brow. Her\r\ndark brown hair is coiled in a jewelled net, a lock strays over her\r\ncheek, as in Zenale's portrait in the Brera altar-piece. Her mauve\r\nbodice is enriched with gold arabesques, and a cross of pearls hangs\r\nfrom a long chain she wears round her throat.\r\n\r\nThere were no _fêtes_ that spring at Milan or Pavia. The treasury was\r\nexhausted by the great expenses of the Empress Bianca's wedding, and the\r\ncourt was still in mourning, while Lodovico's time and thoughts were\r\nabsorbed in diplomatic correspondence and preparations for war. But\r\nthere were gay hunting-parties at Vigevano, in which Beatrice joined\r\nwith all her wonted spirit and love of sport.\r\n\r\n\"I must thank you for your pleasant account of my brother's\r\nhunting-expeditions,\" wrote Lodovico on the 18th of March to his old\r\nfavourite, Count Tuttavilla, who was staying in Rome with Cardinal\r\nAscanio; \"but I really think, if my brother were here and could join in\r\nour hunting-parties, he would find them even more delightful.\" In the\r\nsame letter he gives Girolamo a hint of the deed of investiture which he\r\nwas hoping to receive from Maximilian.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing else to say, saving that, by reason of the warm\r\nfriendship we entertain with his serene Majesty the King of the Romans,\r\nas well as with the Most Christian King, to which we may add the love\r\nwhich his Holiness bears us, I hope soon to give you some good news\r\nwhich will greatly please you.\"[51]\r\n\r\nGirolamo Tuttavilla, the old and tried servant to whom this letter was\r\naddressed, had left Milan in February, owing to a quarrel with Galeazzo\r\ndi Sanseverino and his brothers, whose haughty manners gave frequent\r\noffence to other Milanese courtiers. Both Lodovico and Beatrice, to whom\r\nTuttavilla was sincerely attached, did their best to allay his\r\ndispleasure, and Cardinal Ascanio tried to induce his guest to use\r\ngreater moderation in speaking of Messer Galeazzo and his brothers; but,\r\nalthough Girolamo kept up friendly relations with the duke and duchess,\r\nthe wound was never healed, and he refused to return to Milan. He\r\nafterwards entered the service of the young King Ferrante of Naples, and\r\nwhen a league was formed to oppose the French invaders, was appointed to\r\ncommand the cavalry, but found himself once more brought into contact\r\nwith his old rivals Galeazzo and Fracassa, who were at the head of the\r\nMilanese contingent, and soon parted company with them, complaining\r\nthat Messer Galeazzo would obey no one. But he never renounced his\r\nallegiance to Lodovico, and sent him and Beatrice his most hearty\r\ncongratulations when the Moro became Duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe Sanseverini brothers seem frequently to have given offence to\r\nLodovico's other ministers by their proud bearing. Even the mild and\r\npatient Erasmo Brasca incurred Messer Galeazzo's displeasure by\r\nrepeating some reports about his French leanings which had reached the\r\nGerman court, and had to send an apology before he could obtain pardon\r\nfor his mistake. But nothing could diminish the favour with which\r\nLodovico regarded his son-in-law, and during his absence at Lyons we\r\nfind him busy in preparing a new and splendid palace at Vigevano to\r\nreceive Messer Galeazzo and his youthful bride. In a letter which the\r\nMoro addressed on the 11th of May to his superintendent of works, the\r\nMarchesino Stanga, we find a mention of this building, as well as of the\r\ndecoration of several rooms in the Castello of Milan.\r\n\r\n\"MARCHESINO,--We have given orders that the rooms which are being added\r\non the garden side should be furnished according to the enclosed list,\r\nand desire that you should provide Messer Gualtero with the necessary\r\nmoney, 127-1/2 ducats, which you will charge on the extraordinary fund.\r\nYou will provide in the same way for the moneys which I have assigned\r\nfor the building of Messer Galeazzo's palace, and for the conduits for\r\nwatering the Giardinato and the adjoining lavatories, also for the\r\npainting of the hall and dining-room occupied by the chamberlain of my\r\nillustrious consort, so that they may be fit for use, as arranged, by\r\nthe end of the month.\"[52]\r\n\r\nNeither the pressure of political affairs nor the anxieties of\r\napproaching conflict could destroy Lodovico's interest in artistic\r\nmatters in the decorations of the Castello or the furnishing of his new\r\nrooms. The object which at this time lay nearest to his heart was the\r\ncompletion of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the Dominican church which he\r\nhad taken under his especial protection, and which he intended to be the\r\nburial-place of his family. Even now Bramante was engaged in\r\nconstructing the new cupola, and before long his favourite painter\r\nLeonardo was to set to work on his great Cenacolo in the refectory.\r\n\r\nWhile Lodovico and Beatrice were pursuing these different objects of\r\ntheir ambition, the unfortunate Duchess Isabella was eating out her\r\nheart in the Castello of Pavia. After the imperial wedding, at which she\r\nhad made so brave a show, she and Gian Galeazzo retired to Pavia, and\r\nwere rarely seen in public again. The duke's health and mental condition\r\nbecame every day more enfeebled, and his wife devoted herself wholly to\r\nhim and her children. That winter she gave birth to a second daughter,\r\nwho was named Ippolita after her grandmother, but died at the age of\r\nseven. And now, as if to increase the sadness of her forlorn condition,\r\ncame the prospect of war with Naples, and the invasion of her father's\r\ndominions by a foreign monarch, who entered Italy as the ally of\r\nLodovico, the usurper of her husband's throne. But melancholy as her\r\nsurroundings were, and keenly as she felt the sight of her rival\r\nBeatrice's prosperity, the privations which she and her husband were\r\nforced to endure have been greatly exaggerated. According to Corio, they\r\nwere often destitute of food and necessaries, and reduced to the verge\r\nof starvation. This chronicler, however, was not only frequently\r\ninaccurate in his statements, but had a spite against Duchess Beatrice,\r\nwhose character and actions he totally misrepresented, while, after\r\nLodovico's fall, his ingratitude towards his former master drew down\r\nupon him the bitter reproaches and invective of Lancinius Curtius. In\r\nthis instance his statements are refuted by the bills for the expenses\r\nof the ducal household, which are still preserved in the Milanese\r\narchives. From these records we learn that Isabella's ladies were as\r\nnumerous and as richly dressed as those of any reigning sovereign, and\r\nthat her _camoras_ and jewels were as sumptuous as Beatrice's own. Gian\r\nGaleazzo's stables were always well filled with horses and hounds, for\r\nLodovico was too wise to grudge his nephew anything that tended to\r\noccupy his thoughts and distract them from public affairs. And during\r\nhis last illness the unfortunate duke announced his intention of giving\r\ndowries to a hundred poor maidens on his recovery, which affords another\r\nproof that his poverty was not so great as Corio has declared. But none\r\nthe less it was a bitter mortification for a king's daughter of the\r\nproud house of Aragon to see herself and her husband left with the mere\r\nsemblance of power, while her cousin reigned in her place.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 389.\r\n\r\n[51] Gabotto, G. _Tuttavilla_.\r\n\r\n[52] Luca Beltrami, _Il Castello di Milano_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nArrival of the Duke of Orleans at Asti--The Neapolitan fleet sent\r\nagainst Genoa--The forces of Naples repulsed at Rapallo--Charles VIII.\r\nat Asti--Beatrice d'Este entertains him at Annona--The king's\r\nillness--His visit to Vigevano and Pavia--His interview with the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Milan--Last illness and death of Giangaleazzo\r\nSforza--Lodovico proclaimed Duke at Milan--Mission of Maffeo Pirovano to\r\nMaximilian.\r\n\r\n1494\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, the Duke of Orleans crossed the Alps with the\r\nadvanced guard of the French army, and arrived at his own city of Asti,\r\nthe fief which had formed part of the dowry of his grandmother,\r\nValentina Visconti. Lodovico Sforza went to meet him at Alexandria on\r\nthe 13th of July, and held a council of war there. The naval\r\npreparations that were being made at Genoa were the chief subject of\r\ndiscussion, and Orleans asked for a loan of sixty thousand ducats, which\r\nthe Moro undertook to arrange. This was the first meeting between these\r\ntwo princes, who were destined to become such bitter enemies in days to\r\ncome. Even now it was well known that the Duke of Orleans assumed the\r\ntitle of _Dux Mediolani_, and his deeply rooted aversion to the Moro was\r\nno secret at Milan. But both princes had the same courtly and polished\r\nmanners, and Lodovico on his part took care that nothing should be\r\nwanting in the entertainment of his rival. The other ambassadors watched\r\nthe scene with curious eyes, but the first impression which Louis of\r\nOrleans made upon them was distinctly unfavourable. \"He has a small head\r\nwith not much room for brains,\" wrote Pietro Alamanni to Piero de'\r\nMedici; \"Lodovico will soon get the better of him.\"\r\n\r\nMuch interest was excited among the Milanese ladies by the arrival of\r\nthe French duke, and Benedetto Capilupi, who had been sent from Mantua\r\nto invite Beatrice to the christening of her infant niece, Leonora\r\nGonzaga, wrote to Isabella on the 23rd of July--\r\n\r\n\"The duchess says that when the Duke of Orleans comes here, she will\r\nhave to leave off her mourning and dance, and be kissed by the duke, who\r\nwill kiss all the maids of honour and all the court ladies after the\r\nFrench fashion. Barone, the jester, says that when he has kissed Madonna\r\nPolissena d'Este, he will be tired of it and will go no further. When\r\nthe Count Dauphin and other princes of the blood royal arrive, the\r\nduchess sends your Highness word that you will have to come too and\r\nreceive some of these kisses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans, however, had no time to waste in paying his\r\nrespects to the ladies of Beatrice's court. Directly after his interview\r\nwith Lodovico, he went on to Genoa to fit out the French fleet to oppose\r\nthat in which Alfonso's brother, Don Federigo, had already sailed to\r\nattack Genova. Twice over during the next few weeks the Neapolitan\r\nforces landed at Porto Venere and Rapallo, but each time they were\r\nrepulsed by the Genoese and French troops, supported by a strong\r\nMilanese contingent under the gallant Fracassa and Antonio di\r\nSanseverino, after which Don Federigo retired to the harbour of Leghorn,\r\nand was soon recalled to defend Naples itself against the French. On the\r\n27th of July, the Count of Caiazzo received the _bâton_ of command from\r\nLodovico's hands on the piazza in front of the Castello of Milan, and\r\nstarted at the head of fifteen hundred foot soldiers and light cavalry\r\nto join the French army that was marching into Romagna to meet the\r\nforces led by Ferrante Duke of Calabria. On the 23rd of August, Isabella\r\nd'Este came to Parma at her brother-in-law's invitation to meet him and\r\nthe French ambassador, and see the first French troops under La\r\nTrémouille and Stuart d'Aubigny--the Marchese d'Obegnino, as the\r\nItalians called him--march through the town. The spectacle, however, was\r\nless imposing than she expected, only about four hundred light cavalry\r\nriding past, as she describes it, in some confusion and disorder.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles VIII. had at length crossed the Alps and after pawning\r\nthe jewels of his allies, the Marchioness of Montferrat and Duchess of\r\nSavoy, to pay his troops, arrived at Asti on the 9th of September. Here\r\nhe was received with great honour by Lodovico and his father-in-law,\r\nDuke Ercole, who rode out to meet him on his entry into the town. The\r\nmagistrates and citizens welcomed him as their liege lord, and the\r\nilliterate French barons were amazed to hear a child of eleven,\r\nMargareta Solari, declaim a Latin oration with perfect ease and fluency.\r\nTwo days afterwards Beatrice herself arrived at the castle of Annona, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Asti, bringing her choir of singers and musicians,\r\nand accompanied by eighty ladies especially chosen for their beauty and\r\nrich attire, and gave the king a magnificent reception. Charles\r\nadvanced, cap in hand, to greet the duchess, and, beginning with\r\nBeatrice and Bianca, the young wife of Messer Galeazzo, kissed all the\r\nladies present. The beauty and vivacity of the young duchess made a deep\r\nimpression upon the susceptible French monarch, who could not take his\r\neyes off her, and after spending some time with her in lively\r\nconversation, begged her to allow him to see her dance. Beatrice readily\r\ncomplied with his request, as she tells Isabella in the following\r\nletter, written from Annona on the 12th of September:--\r\n\r\n\"About noonday the king came here to pay me a friendly visit with the\r\nchief lords of his court, and remained for about three hours with me and\r\nmy ladies, conversing with the greatest familiarity and affection. I\r\nassure you that no prince in the world could have made himself more\r\nagreeable. He desired to see my ladies dance, and then begged me to\r\ndance before him, which seemed to give him great pleasure.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe young king himself, short and ill proportioned as he was, with round\r\nshoulders and a large head, a very wide mouth and big nose, cut but a\r\nvery sorry figure by the side of the stately Moro and the handsome\r\nSanseverini brothers; but his good nature and genial manners atoned for\r\nhis want of presence, and surprised Beatrice and her ladies, who had\r\nexpected a far more formidable personage. \"He was little in stature and\r\nof small sense, very timid in speech owing to the way in which he had\r\nbeen treated as a child, and as feeble in mind as he was in body, but\r\nthe kindest and gentlest creature alive,\" says Commines, who accompanied\r\nCharles to Asti, and was sent on as ambassador to Venice. Guicciardini's\r\njudgment is more severe--\r\n\r\n\"And for the increasing of the infelicities of Italy, he whose coming\r\nbrought all these calamities, was void of almost all the gifts of\r\nnature and the mind. For it is most certaine that King Charles from his\r\ninfancie was of complexion very delicate and of body unsound and\r\ndiseased, of small stature, and of face, if the aspect and dignitie of\r\nhis eyes had been taken away, foule and deformed, his other members\r\nbearing such equal proportion that he seemed more a monster than a man.\r\nHe was not only without all knowledge of good sciences, but scarcely he\r\nknew the distinct characters of letters; his mind desirous to command,\r\nbut more proper to any other thing, for that being environed alwayes\r\nwith his familiars and favourites, he retained with them no majestie or\r\nauthoritie; he rejected all affaires and businesse, and yet if he did\r\ndebate and consider in any he showed a weak discretion and judgment. And\r\nif he had anything in him that carried appearance of merite of praise,\r\nyet being thoroughly weighed and sounded, it was found farther off from\r\nvertue than vice. He had an inclination to glory, but it was tempered\r\nmore with rashness and fury than with moderation and counsell: his\r\nliberalities were without discretion, measure, or distinction,\r\nimmoveable oftentimes in his purposes, but that was rather an\r\nill-grounded obstinacy than constancie, and that which many call bountie\r\ndeserved more reasonably in his the name of coldnesse and slacknesse of\r\nspirit.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThe splendours of the court of Milan, and more especially the toilettes\r\nof the Duchess Beatrice and her ladies, amazed the French chroniclers,\r\nwho have left us a graphic description of the scene at the castle of\r\nAnnona. The poet André de la Vigne, in his rhyming chronicle \"Le Vergier\r\nd'honneur,\" describes Beatrice's sumptuous apparel in the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Avecques luy fist venir sa partie\r\n      Qui de Ferrare fille du duc estait;\r\n    De fin drap d'or en tout ou en partie\r\n      De jour en jour volontiers se vestait\r\n    Chaines, colliers, affiquetz, pierrerie,\r\n    Ainsi qu'on dit en ung commun proverbe,\r\n      Tant en avait que c'etait diablerie.\r\n    Brief mieulx valait le lyen que le gerbe.\r\n    Autour du col bagues, joyaulx carcaus,\r\n      Et pour son chief de richesse estoffer,\r\n      Bordures d'or, devises et brocans.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his \"Histoire de Charles VIII.\" (1684) Godefroy quotes the\r\nfollowing letter, written by an eye-witness from the French camp to the\r\nking's sister, Anne Duchess of Bourbon, for whose benefit Charles had\r\nBeatrice's portrait painted by Jean Perréal and sent to Moulins:--\r\n\r\n\"People crowd to meet and welcome the king from all parts, princes and\r\nprincesses, dukes and duchesses. Only this morning a new one has\r\narrived, the description of whose dress will, I am sure, please you.\r\nFirst of all, when she arrived she was on a horse with trappings of gold\r\nand crimson velvet, and she herself wore a robe of gold and green\r\nbrocade, and a fine linen _gorgerette_ turned back over it, and her head\r\nwas richly adorned with pearls, and her hair hung down behind in one\r\nlong coil with a silk ribbon twisted round it. She wore a crimson silk\r\nhat, made very much like our own, with five or six red and grey\r\nfeathers, and with all that on her head, sat up on horseback as straight\r\nas if she had been a man. And with her came the wife of Seigneur Galeaz'\r\nand many other ladies, as many as twenty-two, all riding handsome and\r\nrichly apparelled horses, and six chariots hung with cloth of gold and\r\ngreen velvet, all full of ladies. They had intended to visit the king in\r\nhis lodgings, but this he would not allow, and, in order to appear\r\ngracious, said that he would visit them, but he did not go to their\r\nlodgings that day, feeling unwell. The next day, after dinner, he went\r\nto see this lady, whom he found magnificently arrayed, after the fashion\r\nof the country, in a green satin robe. The bodice of her gown was loaded\r\nwith diamonds, pearls, and rubies, both in front and behind, and the\r\nsleeves were made very tight and slashed so as to show the white chemise\r\nunderneath, and tied up with a wide grey silk ribbon, which hung almost\r\ndown to the ground. Her throat was bare and adorned with a necklace of\r\nvery large pearls, with a ruby as big as your 'Grand Valloy,' and her\r\nhead was dressed just the same as yesterday, only that instead of a hat\r\nshe wore a velvet cap with an aigrette of feathers fastened with a clasp\r\nmade of two rubies, a diamond, and a pear-shaped pearl, like your own,\r\nonly larger. After that the king had paid her a visit, he returned to\r\nhis house, but first he had some conversation with her, and made her\r\ndance in the French fashion, with some of her ladies. And I can assure\r\nyou, madame, that she danced wonderfully well in the French fashion,\r\nalthough she said she had never danced in this manner before. If the\r\nking were not going to send you her picture, to show you the fashion of\r\nher dress, I would have endeavoured to obtain one to send you myself.\"\r\n\r\nA grand _fête_ was arranged for the following day, but the king fell\r\nsuddenly ill of small-pox, and had to call in Messer Ambrogio da Rosate\r\nto attend him. All his plans were altered, and more than a fortnight\r\nelapsed before he was able to leave his room. This delay discouraged the\r\nFrench, who suffered from the great heat, and complained, as Commines\r\ntells us, of the sourness of the country wine, the last vintage having\r\nbeen a bad one. All Lodovico's smooth words and tact were needed to keep\r\nthe leaders in good humour in these trying circumstances. On the other\r\nhand, Alfonso of Naples, taking courage, boldly announced that the\r\napproach of winter and want of pay would force the French to retreat,\r\nand Piero de' Medici sent a troop of Florentine soldiers to join the\r\nDuke of Calabria in Romagna. But their triumph was of short duration. On\r\nthe 6th of October the king had recovered sufficiently to leave Asti,\r\nand while most of his army marched direct to Piacenza, he himself\r\ntravelled by Casale and through the dominions of his ally, the young\r\nMarquis of Montferrat, to Vigevano. Here Lodovico and Beatrice once more\r\ngave their royal guest a splendid reception, and held a banquet and\r\nboar-hunt in his honour during the next two days. The beauty of the\r\npalace, and the wealth and magnificence displayed on all sides, filled\r\nthe French with wonder; but although Charles took Lodovico's advice on\r\nall points, and was apparently on the most cordial terms with his host,\r\nhe asked for the keys of the castle at night, and desired his guards to\r\nkeep strict watch at the gates. \"The fashion of their friendship was\r\nsuch,\" says Commines, \"that it could not last long. But for the present\r\nthe king could not do without Lodovico.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, Charles slept at the Sforzesca and visited Lodovico's\r\nfamous farm of La Pecorara, or Les Granges, as the French chroniclers\r\ntermed this vast farm, where agricultural industries were cultivated on\r\nsuch a splendid scale. They saw the spacious buildings, the stables with\r\ntheir noble columns and separate accommodation for mares and stallions,\r\nand the superb breed of horses which were reared under Messer Galeazzo's\r\ncare; the pastures with their 14,000 buffaloes, oxen, and cows, and as\r\nmany sheep and goats; and the large dairies, where butter and cheese\r\nwere made on the most approved system, and marvelled afresh at the\r\nindustry of the Milanese farmers and the wealth and fertility of this\r\nwonderful land. The next day the king went on to Pavia, where triumphal\r\narches had been prepared for his reception, and the clergy and\r\nprofessors of the university hailed his presence in long harangues and\r\ncomplimentary speeches. At first lodgings had been prepared for him in\r\nthe city, but, according to Commines, some of the king's followers had\r\ninspired him with fears of foul play, and he preferred to take up his\r\nabode in the Castello itself. Lodovico himself showed him the library\r\nand other treasures of his ancestral palace, and took him out hunting in\r\nthe park. On the 15th, he visited the Duomo and Arca di S. Agostino, and\r\non the 16th, rode out to the Certosa, where the monks entertained both\r\nprinces at a grand banquet in a house outside the cloister precincts. In\r\nthe evenings, comedies were acted or musical entertainments given in the\r\nCastello for the king's amusement.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Charles's visit to Pavia, the Duke and Duchess of Milan\r\nand their children were occupying their rooms in the Castello, but\r\nduring the last few weeks Giangaleazzo had become seriously ill and was\r\nunable to leave his bed. Both his wife and his mother Bona were\r\nassiduous in their attentions to the sick prince, and Isabella hardly\r\never left his bedside. The chronicler Godefroy, who has left us so\r\nfaithful and accurate an account of Charles VIII.'s expedition,\r\ndescribes the splendid _fêtes_ given to the king at Pavia, and says that\r\nthe Duchess Isabella, with her young son Francesco, herself received him\r\nat the portico of the Castello, but does not mention his visit to the\r\nsick duke. Another trustworthy authority, Corio, tells us that Charles\r\nwith great thoughtfulness paid a visit to his cousin, who was suffering\r\nfrom an incurable disease, and growing visibly worse, and that the\r\nunfortunate duke recommended his wife and children to the king's care.\r\nCommines, who was at Pavia three days before Charles, on his way to\r\nVenice, says that he saw the little four-year-old prince Francesco, but\r\nnot the duke, since he was very ill and his wife very sorrowful,\r\nwatching by his bedside. \"However,\" he adds, \"the king spoke with him,\r\nand told me their words, which only related to general subjects, for he\r\nfeared to displease Lodovico; all the same, he told me afterwards that\r\nhe would have willingly given him a warning. And the duchess threw\r\nherself on her knees before Lodovico, begging him to have pity upon her\r\nfather and brother. To which he replied that he could do nothing, and\r\ntold her to pray rather for her husband and for herself, who was still\r\nso young and fair a lady.\"\r\n\r\nThe Venetian chronicler, Marino Sanuto, gives a more sensational account\r\nof the interview. According to him, Isabella absolutely refused to see\r\nthe king, and, seizing a dagger, declared she would stab herself rather\r\nthan meet her father's mortal enemy. Lodovico, however, in the end\r\ninduced her to receive the king, upon which she threw herself in tears\r\nat the feet of Charles VIII., and implored him to spare her father and\r\nbrother and the house of Aragon. The king's kindly heart was touched\r\nwith compassion at the grief of the unhappy princess, but he only spoke\r\na few consoling words, and promised that her son should be as dear to\r\nhim as if he were his own son. When Isabella renewed her earnest\r\nentreaties on her father's behalf, he replied that it was too late for\r\nhim to give up the expedition, which had already cost him so much\r\ntrouble and money, and which was now so far advanced that he could not\r\nretire with honour. On the 17th of October, Charles, after assisting at\r\nmass in the chapel of the Castello, left Pavia for Piacenza, where he\r\njoined the French army and prepared to enter Tuscan territory. Here he\r\nlearnt that the Duke of Calabria had been worsted in two engagements by\r\nthe forces of the Count of Caiazzo and the French under d'Aubigny, and\r\nwas in full retreat. And here on the 20th, a courier from Pavia arrived,\r\nbringing Lodovico word that his nephew was dying. He set out at once for\r\nPavia, and met another messenger on the way who told him that the duke\r\nwas already dead. Two days after Charles VIII.'s departure from Pavia,\r\nGiangaleazzo became suddenly worse. A fresh attack of fever was brought\r\non by his own folly in drinking large quantities of wine and eating\r\npears and apples contrary to his doctor's express orders, in spite of\r\nthe continual sickness from which he suffered. The next day he was\r\nrather better, and in the evening of the 20th, the four doctors who were\r\nattending him sent Lodovico an improved account, saying that the duke\r\nhad slept for some hours, and had afterwards been able to take some\r\nchicken-broth, raw eggs, and wine. Now he had fallen asleep again. He\r\nwas certainly no worse, they added, although still very weak and by no\r\nmeans out of danger. That same evening he spoke cheerfully to his\r\ntrusted servant, Dionigi Confanerio, and asked to see two horses which\r\nLodovico had sent him, and which were brought into the hall adjoining\r\nhis rooms for his inspection. Afterwards he spoke affectionately of his\r\nuncle, and said he was sure that Lodovico would have come to see him if\r\nhe had not been obliged to wait upon the French king. And he asked\r\nDionigi in a confidential tone if he thought that Lodovico loved him and\r\nwas sorry to see him so ill, and seemed quite satisfied with his\r\nattendant's assurances on the subject. A former prior of Vigevano, who\r\nhad known the dying prince from his childhood, and had been summoned to\r\nPavia by the duchess, now paid the duke a visit and heard his\r\nconfession, after which Giangaleazzo asked to see his greyhounds, which\r\nwere brought to his bedside, and spoke cheerfully of his speedy recovery\r\nbefore he fell asleep. Early the next morning he died in the presence of\r\nhis wife and mother and the doctors who had attended him during the last\r\nfew weeks.\r\n\r\nA few hours later Lodovico reached Pavia, and without a moment's delay\r\nhastened on to Milan, giving orders that the duke's body should be\r\nremoved as soon as possible to the Duomo of Milan. There during the next\r\nthree days the dead prince lay before the high altar, clad in the ducal\r\ncap and robes, with his sword and sceptre at his side, and his white\r\nface exposed to view. Meanwhile Lodovico had lost no time. His first\r\nact, on his arrival in the Castello, was to summon the councillors,\r\nmagistrates, and chief citizens of Milan to a meeting on the following\r\nday, but even before these dignitaries could be assembled, he called\r\ntogether a few of his immediate friends and courtiers in the great hall\r\nof the Rocchetta, and after informing them of his nephew's premature and\r\nlamentable end, proposed that his son Francesco should be proclaimed\r\nduke in his father's place. Upon this, Antonio da Landriano, prefect of\r\nthe Treasury, responded in an eloquent speech, dwelling on the danger in\r\nthese troublous times of placing the helm of the state in the hands of a\r\nfour-year-old child, and calling on Lodovico, for the sake of the people\r\nwhom he had hitherto ruled so well and wisely in his nephew's name, to\r\nundertake the burden of sovereignty and ascend the ducal throne. \"Since\r\nthe death of Giangaleazzo's father,\" he said, \"we have had no duke but\r\nyou; you alone among our princes can grasp the ducal sceptre with a firm\r\nhand.\" These last words were hailed with loud applause by the Moro's\r\nfriends, and when Landriano had ended his speech, Galeazzo Visconti\r\nBaldassare Pusterla, the able lawyer Andrea Cagnola, and several other\r\ncouncillors, well known for their devotion to the Moro, all spoke in the\r\nsame strain.\r\n\r\n\"It was propounded,\" writes Guicciardini, \"by the principals of the\r\nCounsell, that, in regard of the greatness of that estate and the\r\ndangerous times prepared now for Italy, it would be a thing prejudicial\r\nthat the sonne of John Galeaz, having not five yeares in age, should\r\nsucceed his father, and therefore, as well as to keepe the liberties of\r\nthe State in protection, as to be able to meete with the inconveniences\r\nwhich the time threatened, they thought it just and necessary--derogating\r\nsomewhat for the public benefite, and for the necessite present from the\r\ndisposition of the laws--as the laws themselves do suffer to constraine\r\nLodovic, for the better stay of the commonweale, to suffer that unto him\r\nmight be transported the title and dignitie of Duke, a burden very\r\nweightie, in so dangerous a season; with the which colour, honestie giving\r\nplace to ambition, the morning following, making some show of resistance,\r\nhe tooke upon him the name and armes of the Duke of Milan.\"\r\n\r\nThe Florentine historian's account of the transaction is accurate in all\r\nbut the last particular. Lodovico was indeed proclaimed duke in his\r\nnephew's stead, and, clad in a mantle of cloth of gold, rode that\r\nafternoon through the streets of the city, and visited the church of S.\r\nAmbrogio, to give thanks for his accession to the throne. The ducal\r\nsword and sceptre were borne before him by Galeazzo Visconti, the bells\r\nwere rung, and the trumpets sounded, while the people hailed him with\r\nshouts of _Duca! Duca! Moro! Moro!_ But he was careful to style himself\r\nLodovicus Dux, and would not assume the title of Duke of Milan until he\r\nhad received the imperial privileges, confirming his election and\r\ngranting him the investiture of the duchy. These he lost no time in\r\nsecuring. Already a few weeks before this, Maximilian, mindful of his\r\nengagements at the time of his wedding, had sent his wife's uncle the\r\ndiploma granting him the desired investiture for himself and his sons,\r\nboth legitimate and illegitimate, in succession. The original deed has\r\nnever been discovered, but, according to Corio, the diploma was granted\r\non the 5th of September at Antwerp, with the express stipulation that it\r\nwas not to be published until after the Feast of St. Martin. This\r\ndiploma must have reached Lodovico a week or two before his nephew's\r\ndeath, and had been kept secret, in obedience to Maximilian's desires.\r\nThat memorable day when he rode through the streets of Milan,\r\naccompanied by the ambassadors of Florence and Ferrara, he said in reply\r\nto the congratulations of the latter, our old friend Giacomo Trotti, \"In\r\nanother month you will hear greater news.\" \"I verily believe you,\" said\r\nthe Florentine, Pietro Alamanni, who recorded these words, to Piero de'\r\nMedici, \"that he means to make himself greater still, and dreams of a\r\nkingdom of Insubria and Liguria.\" And Donato de' Preti evidently thought\r\nthe same. \"Signor Lodovico,\" he wrote to Isabella d'Este, \"is not yet\r\ncalled Duke of Milan, but merely duke, and all documents sent out by the\r\nCancelleria are worded in this manner. Some persons who knew his\r\nExcellency well, say that it is his intention to call himself _Rex\r\nInsubrium_. On the return of the ambassador who has been sent to the\r\nemperor, perhaps this will be announced.\"\r\n\r\nNow that Giangaleazzo was actually dead, the Moro felt that there was no\r\ntime to be lost in obtaining the publication of the imperial diploma.\r\nAccordingly he ordered one of his most trusted agents, Maffeo Pirovano,\r\nto start the next day for Antwerp, with letters informing Maximilian and\r\nhis wife of Giangaleazzo's death, and asking for the prompt despatch of\r\nambassadors with the coveted privileges. And that same evening he wrote\r\nlong and minute instructions to Maffeo himself and to Erasmo Brasca at\r\nAntwerp, urging them to lose no time in laying the case before the\r\nemperor. The letter to Maffeo, discovered in the Taverna archives at\r\nMilan, and first published by Signor Calvi in his life of Bianca Sforza,\r\nis of especial interest.\r\n\r\n\"MAPHEO,--We have written this evening to Germany to inform the Most\r\nSerene King of the Romans of the death of the illustrious Duke, our\r\nnephew, and must now send you to state our case _vivâ voce_ to his\r\nMajesty, desiring him to give effect in our person to the ducal\r\nprivileges, which he never consented to give our nephew, in consequence\r\nof the wrong which the emperor supposed to have been done him by our\r\nfather and brother, in holding the duchy without any concession from the\r\nimperial authorities. And therefore the said king has conceded these\r\nprivileges to us, as being innocent of this fault, and as having claims\r\nto the title by reason of our maternal descent, but has desired that\r\nthese privileges should not be made public before the next feast of St.\r\nMartin, and before this date will not fix the time and place for the\r\nexpedition of the said privileges. The approach of this time, the fact\r\nthat this death has compelled us to take up the succession, have\r\nimpelled us to send an envoy to the said king, and for this purpose we\r\nhave made choice of yourself, being persuaded that your faithfulness and\r\nprudence will be equal to the gravity of this emergency. And so I desire\r\nyou to start with the utmost speed, and not to rest till you have found\r\nhis Majesty, and our councillor and ambassador Messer Erasmo Brasca, to\r\nwhom you will explain the reason of your coming, and having through his\r\nmeans obtained an audience of his Majesty, you will pay him our dutiful\r\nrespects, and, after delivering your credentials, by virtue of them will\r\nproceed to tell him how immediately after this death the chiefs of the\r\nState and of the people of this city approached me to offer their\r\ncondolences in the customary manner, and signified their fears and\r\nanxieties as to the succession. One and all, speaking in the name of the\r\nState, declared that they would have no lord but ourselves, and\r\nentreated us with earnest words to accept this dignity, saying that if\r\nwe refused they would not be content and would have to consider some\r\nother mode of action. After this has been explained to the king, you\r\nwill tell him that, seeing on the one hand the conditions imposed by his\r\nMajesty respecting the privileges, which we do not intend to infringe,\r\nand on the other the dangers that might arise if the State were left\r\nwithout a lord until the time fixed for the promulgation of the\r\nprivileges, and being further aware that the people of Milan set the\r\nexample and draw after them all the rest of the State, we have chosen to\r\naccept the burden they offer us, and have ridden through the town in\r\norder to satisfy the wishes of the people. And this we have done, in\r\norder not to leave the State and city in doubt as to the last duke's\r\nsuccessor, without taking either title or armorial bearings, lest we\r\nshould incur the same blame as that illustrious lord our father. Thus,\r\nsolely to prove that the State is not left without a lord, and at the\r\nsame time not to infringe the conditions attached to the privileges, we\r\nhave taken this name of duke, and will inscribe our name as _Ludovicus\r\nDux_ in letters and other documents, without specifying of what place we\r\nare duke, so as to observe the commands laid upon us by his Majesty not\r\nto publish the privileges before the feast of St. Martin. The full form\r\nwhich we intend to adopt at the said feast will be signified to him\r\nafter this feast, when we shall adopt the style of _Dux Mediolani_ in\r\naccordance with this command. But we will abstain from publishing the\r\nprivileges until we have the approval of the said Majesty, which we hope\r\nto obtain as soon as the term which he fixed shall expire.\r\n\r\n\"And you will also tell his Majesty that the publication of these\r\nprivileges carries with it the investiture and enjoyment of the temporal\r\npossessions of the duchy, and therefore, as our procurator, you will ask\r\nfor this investiture with all respect and submission. And you will beg\r\nhis Majesty to send us an ambassador to declare that he places us in\r\npossession of the duchy, in order that he may give the world an outward\r\ndemonstration of the act that he has already done in private. This, we\r\nbeg to assure his Majesty, shall ensure a perpetual obligation on our\r\npart and that of our posterity towards his Majesty, who may count on the\r\nfidelity of this State in all contingencies, most of all in the affairs\r\nof Italy, where no State can be greater or of more importance than this\r\none, which has the same influence in Italy as he has in Germany. And\r\nsince the form of investiture has been given this summer to the\r\nTreasurer of Burgundy, you can obtain it from him by means of Messer\r\nErasmo, and we will afterwards send you the imperial mandate that you\r\nmay arrange this. As to the form of delivery of the temporalities, we\r\ndesire to follow that which was employed in the cases of former dukes,\r\nwhich we will seek out and let you have. To this effect you will\r\nnegotiate with the Most Serene King of the Romans, making use of the\r\nadvise of Messer Erasmo, in order to obtain this concession in the\r\nmanner that we devise.\r\n\r\n\"You will also visit our niece, the Most Serene Queen, and condole in\r\nour name on the duke's death, which is a common cause of grief to both\r\nof us, and will recommend our affairs to her, begging her Majesty to\r\nassist you, and to employ great warmth and fervour in addressing the\r\nMost Serene Lord her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Milan, 22nd October, 1494.\"\r\n\r\nThese instructions were followed by a short letter from Lodovico,\r\nenclosing the petition to be presented to Maximilian, and urging him to\r\nlose no time in reaching his destination.\r\n\r\n\"MAPHEO,--We enclose the petition for the investiture, and have to-day\r\nsent you money and horses. There is nothing more to say, excepting to\r\nurge you once more to use all diligence to seek out His Serene Majesty,\r\nand with the help of Erasmo leave nothing undone that may induce him to\r\ngrant the investiture without delay, and at the same time send back with\r\nyou persons empowered to put me in possession of the temporal\r\npossessions of the duchy. Without these two things, all that has been\r\ndone till now will be of no avail.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, Lodovico sent an official intimation of his nephew's death,\r\nand of the \"incredible grief\" which this sad event had given him, to his\r\nrelatives and allies. On the 22nd, he issued another circular, informing\r\nthem in well-turned phrases of his election by the people of Milan, and\r\nof his consent to take up the burden imposed upon him by the will of his\r\nsubjects. And on the same day the Mantuan envoy, Donato de' Preti,\r\nwriting to Isabella d'Este, gave her the following version of affairs:\r\n\"This morning a meeting was held in the Castello, at which Signor\r\nLodovicus was proclaimed King of Milan in the presence of the gentlemen\r\nand councillors assembled in the Rocchetta, no one else being nominated.\r\nFew spoke, and very little was said, but Signor Lodovico was chosen by\r\nuniversal acclamation, or at least with no dissent. This afternoon he\r\ncame out of the Rocca clad in gold brocade, and rode all round the town\r\nfor the space of two hours, and the shops are closed, and all the bells\r\nof the city are to be rung for three days.\" At Pavia, where the Moro had\r\nmade himself greatly beloved both by the citizens and the members of the\r\nuniversity, there was great rejoicing when the people heard him publicly\r\nproclaimed duke to the sound of fifes and trumpets. \"All the people of\r\nPavia,\" wrote Count Borella, on the 23rd of October, \"are filled with\r\nthe utmost joy and delight, like the loyal and affectionate servants of\r\nyour Highness that they are, and pray that you may live long to enjoy\r\nyour exalted dignity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 27th, the body of the late duke, after lying in\r\nstate during several days before the high altar in the Duomo of Milan,\r\n\"was buried in the vault of his ancestors with the greatest pomp and\r\nhonour,\" as the Mantuan envoy told Isabella d'Este. \"The Marchese Ermes,\r\nthe Ferrarese ambassador, with the whole house of Visconti, and all the\r\ncouncillors, ministers, and court officials attending, robed in black.\r\nAn immense concourse of people were present, together with priests and\r\nfriars innumerable, and the blaze of lighted wax candles was so great in\r\nthe church that I could see nothing. An eloquent and highly ornate\r\nsermon was preached by a Mantuan friar, named Giovanni Pietro Suardo.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the next day his successor joined the French king in his camp under\r\nthe walls of Sarzana. He had at length attained the object of his\r\nambition, and was reigning on his father's throne.\r\n\r\n\"To sum up the whole matter,\" writes Commines, \"Lodovico had himself\r\nproclaimed Lord of Milan, and that, as many people say, was the reason\r\nwhy he brought us over the mountains.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 394.\r\n\r\n[54] Guicciardini's \"Italy,\" Fenton's English translation, vol. i. p.\r\n34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLodovico joins Charles VIII. at Sarzana--Suspicious rumours as to the\r\nlate duke's death--Piero de' Medici surrenders the six fortresses of\r\nTuscany to Charles VIII.--Lodovico retires in disgust from the\r\ncamp--Congratulations of all the Italian States on his accession--Grief\r\nof Duchess Isabella--Her return to Milan--Mission of Maffeo Pirovano to\r\nAntwerp--His interviews with Maximilian and Bianca--Letter of Lodovico\r\nto the Bishop of Brixen--Charles VIII. enters Rome--His treaty with\r\nAlexander VI. and departure for Naples.\r\n\r\n1494\r\n\r\n\r\nThe short week which had elapsed between the king's departure from Pavia\r\nand the return of Lodovico to the French camp had effected a complete\r\nchange in the situation. Suddenly the Moro found himself at the height\r\nof his ambition, elected duke by popular acclamation, and in actual\r\npossession of the throne, while he held in his hands the imperial\r\ndiploma that was to give him a surer and safer title to the duchy than\r\nany of his race had possessed.\r\n\r\n\"All that this man does prospers, and all that he dreams of by night\r\ncomes true by day,\" wrote the Venetian chronicler. \"And, in truth, he is\r\nesteemed and revered throughout the world and is held to be the wisest\r\nand most successful man in Italy. And all men fear him, because fortune\r\nfavours him in everything that he undertakes.\"\r\n\r\nBut already ugly rumours began to be whispered abroad. The unhappy duke,\r\nit was openly said at Florence and Venice, had, it was plain, died of\r\npoison, administered by his uncle. The moment of his death was so\r\nopportune, and fitted in so exactly with Lodovico's plans; the\r\npromptness with which the Moro had acted in seizing the crown which\r\nought to have belonged to Giangaleazzo's son, helped to confirm the\r\nsuspicions that were aroused in the minds of men whom the new duke's\r\npolicy had inspired with distrust, and who looked with jealous eyes on\r\nthe success of his diplomacy. The French king's doctor, Theodore\r\nGuainiero of Pavia, was quite sure he had detected signs of poisoning in\r\nthe sick duke's face when he had been present at the interview between\r\nhis royal master and poor Giangaleazzo at Pavia. Contemporary\r\nchroniclers, improving upon this remark, with one voice asserted that\r\nthe doctor had found evident traces of poison on the body at a\r\npost-mortem examination held after the duke's death, ignoring the fact\r\nthat at that moment Theodore Guainiero was with King Charles at\r\nPiacenza. So the legend grew, and found ready acceptance among both\r\nFrench and Italians, who alike hated the Moro with deadly hatred.\r\n\r\n\"And if the duke were dispatched by poison, there was none,\" wrote the\r\nFlorentine historian, \"that held that his uncle was innocent, and either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, as he, who not content with an absolute power,\r\nbut aspiring, according to the common desires of great men, to make\r\nthemselves glorious with titles and honours, and especially he judged\r\nthat both for his proper heritage and the succession of his children,\r\nthe death of the lawful duke was necessary, wherein ambition and\r\ncovetousness prevailed above conscience and law of nature, and the\r\njealous desire of dominion enforced his disposition, otherwise abhorring\r\nblood, to that vile action.\"\r\n\r\nThe careful examination of the various documents connected with\r\nGiangaleazzo's death has led recent historians to a different\r\nconclusion. \"Nothing is further from the truth,\" writes Magenta, in his\r\nhistory of the \"Castello di Pavia,\" \"than that Giangaleazzo died of\r\npoison.\" And Delaborde, Porrò, Cantù, as well as those able and learned\r\nscholars, Signor Luzio and Signor Renier, all endorse these statements,\r\nand ascribe the duke's death to natural causes. Even Paolo Giovio, who\r\nhated the Moro as the man who had betrayed his country to the French,\r\nowns that there is much reason for doubting the truth of the accusation\r\nbrought against him in this instance. Charles VIII., it is plain, did\r\nnot himself believe in Lodovico's guilt. When the news of Giangaleazzo's\r\ndeath reached him, he caused a solemn requiem mass to be held in the\r\nDuomo of Piacenza, and distributed liberal alms to the poor of the town\r\nin memory of his dead cousin. And Galeazzo di Sanseverino, who had\r\nremained in attendance upon the king, informed Lodovico, in one of his\r\nletters, that the only remark which His Most Christian Majesty had made\r\non the subject was to express his sorrow for the duke's orphan children,\r\nand to say that he hoped Signor Lodovico would treat them as his own, to\r\nwhich Galeazzo replied that he might rest assured they would want for\r\nnothing. But the suspicion that the duke's end had been hastened by his\r\nuncle's act found general acceptance in the French army, and deepened\r\nthe distrust with which Lodovico was already regarded. At this critical\r\nmoment, the unexpected action of Piero de' Medici helped to bring about\r\na breach between the Moro and his allies.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 31st of October, the new duke reached the French camp\r\nbefore the Tuscan castle of Sarzana, he found to his surprise that Piero\r\nde' Medici, who up to this time had been the staunchest ally of Naples,\r\nhad arrived there the day before, to make his submission to King\r\nCharles. Sanuto relates how this craven son of the magnificent Lorenzo\r\nthrew himself at the feet of the French monarch, and promised to accept\r\nwhatever conditions he chose to impose. Not only did he agree to give\r\nthe army of Charles free passage through Tuscany, and to dismiss the\r\nFlorentine troops which he had levied, but he actually promised to\r\nsurrender the six strongholds of Sarzana, Sarzanello, Pietra Santa,\r\nLibrafratta, Leghorn, and Pisa. Thus, without a single blow, the city\r\nand state of Florence was placed at the mercy of the invaders. Even the\r\nFrench councillors who negotiated the terms of the treaty, were amazed\r\nat the readiness with which their demands were accepted, and told\r\nCommines afterwards that they marvelled to see Piero de' Medici settle\r\nso weighty a matter with so much lightness of heart, \"mocking and\r\njeering at his cowardice as they spoke.\" Lodovico, on his part, received\r\nthe news of Piero's disgraceful concessions with ill-concealed disgust.\r\nNow that he had attained his own objects, and had nothing to fear from\r\nAlfonso, whose armies were in full retreat, he would willingly have seen\r\nthe progress of the French delayed, and the king forced to winter in\r\nTuscany, and was bitterly annoyed to find that the passes of the\r\nApennines were in the hands of Charles, as well as the castles and ports\r\nwhich he had hoped to obtain for Milan as the price of his alliance.\r\nGuicciardini relates how he met Piero de' Medici that day in the camp,\r\nand how his old friend's son, anxious to ingratiate himself with the\r\npowerful duke, made excuses for not having given him an official welcome\r\ninto Florentine territory, saying that he had ridden out to meet him,\r\nbut had missed his way. \"One of us certainly missed the way,\" replied\r\nthe duke, with a bitter meaning under his courteous phrases; \"perhaps it\r\nis you who have taken the wrong road.\"\r\n\r\nBut he hid his vexation as best he could, when he entered the French\r\nking's presence, and boldly asked Charles to give him the castles of\r\nSarzana and Pietra Santa, which had formerly belonged to Genoa. When the\r\nking replied that he preferred to keep these forts in his own hands\r\nuntil his return from Naples, Lodovico once more disguised his feelings,\r\nand contented himself with asking for a renewal of the investiture of\r\nGenoa, formerly granted to his nephew, which he obtained on payment of\r\n30,000 ducats. After this he saw no reason for remaining in the French\r\ncamp any longer, and, pleading urgent State affairs, he left again for\r\nMilan on the 3rd of November.\r\n\r\n\"_Et merveilleusement malcontent_,\" says Commines, \"_se partit du Roy\r\npour le reffuz_.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the Count of Caiazzo, with a troop of fifty horse, remained in the\r\nFrench camp, while Galeazzo di Sanseverino and Duchess Beatrice's\r\nbrother, Ferrante d'Este, were the sole Italians to be seen riding in\r\nthe royal procession when Charles made his triumphal entry into\r\nFlorence. \"Many thought then,\" adds the Sieur d'Argenton, \"that he\r\nwished the king out of Italy.\" A week later he recalled the Milanese\r\ntroops from Romagna, saying that their presence was no longer needed.\r\nFor the present, however, the new Duke of Milan took a strictly neutral\r\nline, and while he outwardly maintained friendly relations with France,\r\nat the same time received congratulatory messages on his accession from\r\nthe Pope, the Doge and Signory of Venice, and his old enemy, Alfonso of\r\nNaples, who forgot all the grievances of the past in his dismay at the\r\napproach of the French invaders.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November Lodovico returned to Milan, and joined his wife\r\nat Vigevano, where Beatrice had remained during her husband's absence\r\nwith her infant son. We have no letters to tell us what her feelings\r\nwere at this eventful period, and do not learn if she joined her husband\r\nduring the few days of his hurried visit to Milan in October. But we are\r\nglad to find that she expressed sympathy with the unhappy widow of\r\nGiangaleazzo, and showed real concern for her cousin's melancholy\r\ncondition. After her husband's death, Isabella's courage and fortitude\r\nbroke down under the long strain, and for some days she shut herself up\r\nin a dark room, and refused to take food, or accept any comfort. Four\r\nMilanese councillors waited upon her at Pavia to offer their\r\ncondolences, and invited her to come to Milan in the name of the new\r\nduke and the people, assuring her that she and her children should be\r\ntreated with due honour, and retain possession of the ducal residence in\r\nthe Castello. This attention gratified her, and Paolo Bilia, an old and\r\nfaithful servant, who had been long in her service, wrote by her desire\r\nto Lodovico on the 28th of October--\r\n\r\n\"My Lady is much pleased to hear that you have accepted the gift which\r\nshe sent you, and is grateful for the kind messages which she has\r\nreceived from Your Illustrious Consort, as well as the offers which you\r\nhave made her, and the addresses of the councillors. Under Niccolo da\r\nCusano's treatment her health has certainly improved; and the children\r\nare very well, only the boy objects to the black clothes and hangings of\r\nthe rooms.\"\r\n\r\nA week later the Councillor Pusterla wrote that he visited the Duchess\r\nevery day, and found her much rested, and already considerably calmer,\r\nand was charged to convey her warmest thanks to the duke for his\r\nkindness, and express her wish to show herself in all things his\r\nobedient daughter. But she still refused to leave Pavia, and shrank from\r\nseeing any one but her children and servants.\r\n\r\n\"The duchess,\" wrote Donato de Preti from Milan to his mistress Isabella\r\nd'Este, \"has not yet arrived here, but is expected on Friday. All the\r\nrooms and furniture in the Castello are hung with black. To-day a man\r\nwho came from Pavia is said to have brought word that Count Borella had\r\nbeen sent to ask the duchess for her son Francesco, but that she had\r\nrefused to send him. This, however, may not be true, for the person who\r\ntold me is not to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of November, the same informant wrote again--\r\n\r\n\"The widowed duchess has not yet come to Milan. It appears that she has\r\nasked leave to remain at Pavia until after her confinement, and this she\r\nwill certainly do. I hear that she still mourns her dead lord.\"\r\n\r\nHer mother-in-law, Duchess Bona, remained with her at Pavia, and here,\r\non the first of December, she received a visit from Chiara Gonzaga, a\r\nsister of the Marquis of Mantua, and wife of Gilbert, Duke of\r\nMontpensier, who was captain-general of the French army. This princess,\r\nwho was now on her way to Mantua, was sincerely attached to both\r\nIsabella and Beatrice d'Este, and proved a loyal friend to Lodovico at\r\nthe French court, while after her husband's death he, in his turn, gave\r\nher the benefit of his powerful help in her efforts to obtain the\r\nrecovery of her fortune from the French king. There seems, however, to\r\nhave been no truth in the report that the widowed duchess was again with\r\nchild, and on the 6th of December she finally summoned up courage to\r\nreturn to Milan. On her arrival she was received by Beatrice, and\r\nBarone, the jester, who was on the same familiar terms with the\r\nMarchioness of Mantua as he was with her sister, sent her the following\r\npathetic account of their meeting--\r\n\r\n\"Last night the Duchess Isabella arrived in Milan, and our duchess went\r\nto meet her, two miles outside the town, and directly they met, our\r\nduchess got out of her chariot and entered that of Duchess Isabella,\r\nboth of them weeping bitterly, and so they rode together towards the\r\nCastello, where the Duke of Milan met them on horseback at the gate of\r\nthe garden. He took off his cap, and accompanied them to the Castello,\r\nwhere they all three alighted, and placing Duchess Isabella between\r\nthem, our duke and duchess accompanied her to her old rooms. When they\r\nreached these rooms they sat down together, and the Duchess Isabella\r\ncould do nothing but weep, until at last the duke spoke to her, and\r\nbegged her to calm herself, and be comforted, with many other similar\r\nwords. Dear friend, the hardest heart would have been melted with\r\ncompassion at the sight of her, with her three children, looking so thin\r\nand altered by her grief, wearing a long black robe like a friar's\r\nhabit, made of rough cloth, worth fourpence the yard, and her eyes\r\nhidden by a thick black veil. Certainly I, for one, could not help\r\ncrying, and if I had not restrained myself, I should have wept still\r\nmore.\"[55]\r\n\r\nUntil the death of Beatrice, Isabella of Aragon and her children\r\noccupied the rooms in the Castello where she and her husband had\r\nformerly resided, and spent the spring and summer in the Castello of\r\nPavia, but the widowed duchess lived in complete retirement during the\r\nnext two years, and her name seldom appears in contemporary records. Her\r\nmother-in-law Bona, retained her rooms until the following January, when\r\nthe duke desired her to move to the old palace near the Duomo, known as\r\nthe Corte Vecchia, partly because the use of her apartments was required\r\nby the court officials, and partly owing to the intrigues which she\r\nsecretly practised. Only lately Lodovico's envoys at Antwerp had\r\ninformed him of the bitter words which Bona wrote against him to her\r\ndaughter Bianca, words which the empress's secretary thought it wiser to\r\npass over when he read her mother's letters aloud, taking care, he adds,\r\nto see that they were burnt before they could do further mischief. A\r\nyear afterwards, Bona left Milan for good and returned to France, where\r\nshe lived at Amboise until the end of 1499, when she came back to her\r\nnative land of Savoy, and died at Fossano on the 8th of January, 1504.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maffeo Pirovano, after being delayed on his journey by violent\r\nstorms and floods, and narrowly escaping with his life from the brigands\r\nand highwaymen who infested the streets of Cologne, had at length\r\nreached Antwerp and discharged his errand. In his letters to the duke,\r\nhe gives an interesting account of his interview with the emperor, whose\r\nimposing presence and gracious kindness made a deep impression upon him.\r\n\r\n\"The Most Serene King has the noblest bodily presence as well as the\r\ngreatest qualities of mind and soul, and as far as you can judge from\r\noutward signs, I should say that his Majesty's wisdom and loyalty are\r\nbeyond dispute, and that there is no prince in the world whom he\r\nesteems more highly than your Excellency. And if I asked why all the\r\nking's dealings appear slow and tardy, I should say that this was caused\r\nby two obstacles, which neither of them proceed from his Majesty's own\r\nfault. The first is want of money, and the second the little confidence\r\nthat he can place in his ministers.\"\r\n\r\nMaffeo was able to give Lodovico satisfactory assurances as to\r\nMaximilian's readiness to confirm him in the investiture of Milan. He\r\npromised to send the letters forthwith, but desired the duke to allow no\r\none but his brother Cardinal Ascanio to see a copy, and not to publish\r\nthem before March. \"He fears,\" wrote the Milanese envoy, \"in the first\r\nplace the electors of the Diet, and in the second the wrath of King\r\nAlfonso of Naples. But his Majesty promises to speak to the electors as\r\nsoon as possible, and after that will have the privileges drawn up by\r\nthe chancellor, and will send a solemn embassy to put the duke in\r\npossession of his dignities and the realm.\r\n\r\nThe young empress, who, Maffeo remarked, \"is not very wise,\" was\r\noverjoyed to see an old friend, and had much to hear about her beloved\r\nMilanese home. She wrote an affectionate little note to her uncle,\r\nlamenting her poor brother's death and congratulating him on his\r\naccession, which she called \"a due reward of all the benefits which we\r\nhave received from your Excellency.\"[56]\r\n\r\nAnd when Maffeo left Antwerp early in December to return to Milan, he\r\nreceived a whole string of commissions from her Majesty. He was, in the\r\nfirst place, to visit and condole with her mother, her widowed\r\nsister-in-law, and her brother Ermes, and to commend the Duchess\r\nIsabella and her children especially to the duke. Then he was to beg the\r\nduke and duchess to send her their latest portraits, as well as those of\r\nher mother, brother, sister-in-law, and her sister Madonna Anna, wife of\r\nAlfonso d'Este. There was a special message to Beatrice, begging her for\r\nsome perfumes and powders, a ball of musk, and a bunch of heron's\r\nplumes. And there was another for Lodovico, asking him to try and\r\nprocure a certain set of pearls from Bianca's half-sister, Caterina\r\nSforza, the famous Madonna of Forli. Last of all, there was an earnest\r\nrequest that the duke would entreat her lord the Most Serene King to\r\ncome to Italy, and write urgently to him on the subject, without,\r\nhowever, letting it appear that the suggestion had proceeded from Bianca\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIn these communications between the empress and her family there is no\r\ntrace whatever of any ill-will to Lodovico and Beatrice, far less any\r\nsuspicion that her uncle had hastened her brother's death, although some\r\nchroniclers allude to a report that Maximilian's wife held Lodovico to\r\nbe guilty of this crime. The fact that some rumour of this kind had\r\nreached the imperial court seems probable from the Latin letter which\r\nLodovico himself addressed in December, 1494, to the Bishop of Brixen,\r\none of the delegates who were afterwards sent to Milan with the imperial\r\nprivilege. In this letter the Moro refutes the calumny which he hears\r\nhad been brought against him in certain quarters, and points out that\r\nhis nephew's death had been due to natural causes, that the late duke\r\nhad been ill for many months, and that he had been assiduously attended\r\nby his devoted wife and the most skilful doctors, three of whom had\r\nknown him from his cradle. He alludes to the visit paid to Giangaleazzo\r\na few days before his death by His Most Christian Majesty, and explains\r\nthat he himself was only prevented from being present at his nephew's\r\ndeath-bed by the necessity of attending on the French king. \"Nothing,\"\r\nhe adds, \"could be more contrary to our nature than so great a crime.\"\r\nIn conclusion, he dwells on the fatherly love which he had always shown\r\nhis nephew, and renews his protestations of devotion to His Most Serene\r\nMajesty the King of the Romans. In point of fact, as both Maffeo and\r\nBrasca informed their master the subject which disquieted Maximilian at\r\nthis moment far more than poor Giangaleazzo's death, was the rapid\r\nadvance of the French king. A rumour had reached the German court that\r\nCharles aspired to the imperial title, and intended to make the Pope\r\ncrown him in Rome. This report filled the emperor-elect with dismay, and\r\nhe turned to the Milanese envoys with the words, \"I know that the Duke\r\nof Milan has great power in Italy, and has proved his faith and good\r\nintentions towards myself, but I hope, since he is so wise in\r\neverything, that he will make some difference between me and the King of\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nLodovico, however, needed no warning on this subject, and was as much\r\nalarmed as any of his neighbours at the extraordinary success which had\r\nattended Charles VIII.'s expedition. Florence and Siena both received\r\nhim within their gates, and helped him with loans of money and supplies\r\nof corn. On the 4th of December he left Siena; by the 10th he was at\r\nViterbo, within sixty miles of Rome, and sent the Pope word that he\r\nwould spend Christmas in the Vatican and treat with him there. For a\r\nmoment Alexander VI., encouraged by the arrival of the Duke of\r\nCalabria's army under the walls of the eternal city, put on a bold face\r\nand defied Charles to do his worst. The same day he arrested the\r\ncardinals Ascanio Sforza and Sanseverino at a consistory in the Vatican,\r\nupon which Galeazzo di Sanseverino, who was at Viterbo with the French\r\nking, rode all the way to Vigevano in three days, to take Lodovico the\r\nnews of this insult to his family. The duke was furious, and vowed\r\nvengeance upon the Pope. But Alexander's courage soon failed him. In a\r\nfew days his defiant mood gave place to one of abject terror, the two\r\ncardinals were released and sent to plead the Pope's cause with Charles\r\nVIII., and on the 30th of December Ferrante retired with his troops\r\ntowards Naples. That same day the French king entered Rome by the\r\nFlaminian Gate, and rode in triumphal procession along the Corso with\r\nCardinals Giuliano delle Rovere and Ascanio Sforza at his side, both of\r\nthem, remarks Commines, great enemies of the Pope, and still greater\r\nenemies of one another. Alexander fled for shelter to the Castello\r\nSant'Angelo, and Charles took up his abode in the palace of San Marco,\r\nfrom which he dictated terms of peace to the terrified pontiff. Already\r\na rumour had reached Milan that the Pope was to be deposed, and that the\r\nFrench king intended to attempt a general reformation of the scandals\r\nthat disgraced the Church.\r\n\r\n\"His Most Christian Majesty,\" remarked Lodovico, drily, \"had better\r\nbegin by reforming himself.\" And when the Venetian ambassador Sebastian\r\nBadoer and Benedetto Trevisano arrived at Vigevano to take counsel with\r\nthe duke in this perilous state of affairs, he spoke very contemptuously\r\nof the king's person and character.\r\n\r\n\"The Most Christian King,\" he said, \"is young and foolish, with little\r\npresence and still less mental power. When I was with him at Asti,\r\ntreating of important matters, his councillors spent their time eating\r\nand playing cards in his presence. Sometimes he would dictate a letter\r\nby one man's advice, and then withdraw it at the suggestion of another.\r\nHe is haughty and ill-mannered, and when we were together, he has more\r\nthan once left me alone in the room like a beast, to go and dine with\r\nhis friends.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to remind the Venetian envoys how he had sent his wife,\r\nDuchess Beatrice, to warn the Signoria of the critical state of affairs,\r\nand how his advice had been neglected, and nothing had been done.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" the duke added, \"that I lent the king money, but at the\r\nsame time I gave him good advice. 'Sire,' I said to him, 'drive out the\r\ntyrant Piero de' Medici, and give Florence her old liberties;' and when\r\nI refused to accompany him further, I desired Messer Galeaz to defend\r\nthe freedom and rights of both Florence and Siena. You see how little\r\nthe king has followed my advice and how cruel and insolent he has shown\r\nhimself. These French are bad people, and we must not allow them to\r\nbecome our neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality, what disturbed the Duke of Milan far more than the success\r\nof Charles in the south, was the presence of Louis of Orleans with a\r\nbody of troops at Asti. When Charles left Asti in October, his cousin\r\nwas ill with an attack of fever, and had been compelled to remain\r\nbehind. The close vicinity of this dangerous neighbour, and the boldness\r\nwith which Orleans asserted his claim on Milan, led the Moro to use all\r\nhis influence with Maximilian to induce him to join his old enemies, the\r\nVenetians, in a common league against the French. While these\r\nnegotiations were being secretly carried on, the victorious French king\r\nhad, on the 15th of January, signed a treaty with the Pope, by which the\r\ncrown of Naples was bestowed upon him, and the chief fortresses of the\r\nPapal States were surrendered into his hands until his return. The next\r\nday Charles attended mass at St. Peter's, and met the Pope in the\r\nVatican--\"a very fine house,\" he wrote to his brother-in-law, the Duke\r\nof Bourbon, \"as well furnished and adorned as any palace or castle I\r\nhave ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, he did homage to His Holiness before the College\r\nof Cardinals, as Vicar of Christ and successor of the Apostles, and was\r\nembraced and welcomed by the Pope in return as the eldest son of the\r\nChurch. A week later he left Rome and set out at the head of his army on\r\nthe march to Naples. And the same day he received the news that Alfonso\r\nof Aragon, seized with a fatal panic, had abdicated his crown in favour\r\nof his son Ferrante, and was on his way to Sicily.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] A Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 399.\r\n\r\n[56] F.

Once more\r\ngreat preparations were made in the Rocchetta for the happy event. On\r\nthe 10th of December her sister Isabella sent her the size and pattern\r\nof a cradle which her father had given her before the birth of her\r\nlittle daughter, Leonora, the year before, excusing herself for not\r\nwriting a longer letter because she was engaged with her sister-in-law,\r\nthe Duchess of Montpensier. Duke Lodovico himself, immediately on his\r\nreturn to Vigevano in November, had written begging the Marchesa to come\r\nto Milan in January, and on the 15th she left Mantua. On the day after\r\nher arrival she paid a visit of condolence to the widowed duchess, whose\r\nsorrowful condition filled her with compassion.\r\n\r\n\"I found her in the large room,\" writes Isabella to her husband, on the\r\n20th of January, \"all hung with black, with only just light and air\r\nenough to save one from suffocation. Her Highness wore a cloth cloak,\r\nand a black veil on her head, and her deep mourning filled me with so\r\nmuch compassion that I could not keep back my tears. I condoled with her\r\nin your name and my own, and she gratefully accepted my sympathy, and\r\nsent for her children, the sight of whom increased my emotion.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February, Beatrice gave birth to a second son, a fine boy,\r\nwho received no less than fifteen names, including those of Francesco\r\nSforza, after his illustrious grandfather. As a child he was called\r\nSforza, but became afterwards known as Francesco, under which name he\r\nreigned during the last years of his short life over the duchy of Milan.\r\nIsabella d'Este held the infant prince at the baptismal font, and\r\nremained at Milan till the end of the Carnival, at the urgent entreaty\r\nof her brother-in-law, who himself wrote to beg the marquis for\r\npermission to keep his wife a few weeks longer.\r\n\r\nAlfonso d'Este and his wife, Anna Sforza, always a favourite at the\r\ncourt of Milan, now joined the ducal party, and took part in the\r\nbrilliant series of festivities which celebrated Beatrice's recovery and\r\nthe christening of the infant prince.\r\n\r\n\"Every third day,\" wrote Isabella to an absent Milanese friend of hers,\r\nAnton Maria de' Collis, \"we have triumphal and magnificent festivities,\r\none of which lasted till two in the morning, another was not over till\r\nfour o'clock. We spend the intervening days in riding and driving in the\r\npark or else through the streets of Milan, which has been made so\r\nbeautiful that if you were to come back here to-day, you would no longer\r\nknow the place.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter Isabella describes a splendid _festa_ at the house of\r\nMesser Niccolo da Correggio, at which a representation of the fable of\r\nHippolyte and Theseus, as told in the \"_Innamoramento di Orlando_\" was\r\nbeautifully given. And in answer to a letter from her brother-in-law,\r\nGiovanni Gonzaga, telling her of an allegorical representation in which\r\nthe famous Serafino of Aquila had taken part, she writes--\r\n\r\n\"Here too we are enjoying feasts and pleasures of every description,\r\nwhich afford us the greatest possible delight, and I hope to tell you\r\nmany things that will excite your Highness's envy. For this is the\r\nschool of the master of those who know.\"[57]\r\n\r\nSuch phrases as these were no small praise on the lips of so\r\naccomplished and critical a woman as Isabella d'Este. Another\r\ncontemporary, the Florentine Guicciardini, who visited the capital of\r\nLombardy, was filled with amazement at the sight, and describes Milan\r\nduring Lodovico's reign as famous for the wealth of its citizens; the\r\ninfinite number of its shops; the abundance and delicacy of all things\r\npertaining to human life; the superb pomp and sumptuous ornaments of its\r\ninhabitants, both men and women; the skill and talent of its artists,\r\nmechanics, embroiderers, goldsmiths, and armourers; and the innumerable\r\nquantity of new and stately buildings which adorn its streets. \"Not\r\nonly,\" he adds, \"is the city full of joy and pleasure, of feasting and\r\ndelight, but so wonderfully is it increased in riches, magnificence, and\r\nglory, that it may certainly be called the most flourishing and happiest\r\nof all the cities in Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger from Florence and Venice might well admire the duke's\r\nknowledge and taste, and wonder at the splendid results which his\r\nenlightened patronage of art and learning had produced. For they saw his\r\ngreat city of Milan as it has never been seen again, before the savage\r\ninvader had spoiled its charm and defaced its loveliness; when\r\nBramante's churches and porticoes rose in perfect symmetry against the\r\nsky, and the glowing tints of Leonardo's frescoes were yet fresh upon\r\nthe walls. They saw the _Ruga bella_, or Beautiful Way, with its long\r\nline of palaces on either side, its painted walls and richly carved\r\nportals. They saw the lovely cupola of S. Maria delle Grazie, and the\r\nmarble cloisters of S. Ambrogio, and the graceful Baptistery of S.\r\nSatiro, which Caradosso had lately adorned with his elegant frieze of\r\ncherubs and medallions. They saw the stately arcades of the Spedale\r\nGrande, and the deep-red brick and terra-cotta pile of the vast\r\nLazzaretto, and the wide streets and piazzas which the duke had laid out\r\n\"to give the people more light and air.\" Above all, they saw the great\r\nCastello which was the pride of Lodovico's court. These vaulted ceilings\r\nand painted halls, these beautiful gardens with their temples and\r\nlabyrinths, their fountains and statues, these splendid stables with\r\ncolumned aisles and walls adorned with frescoes of horses, which the\r\nFrench invaders admired more than anything else in Milan, were well-nigh\r\ncomplete. But still Lodovico was always planning some new improvements\r\nto add to the charm and pleasantness of the ducal residence. Isabella's\r\nfriend Leonardo, we know from one of the duke's letters, was engaged at\r\nthis moment in painting the vaults of the newly built Camerini, while\r\nhe was still putting the last touches to the famous equestrian statue\r\nwhich the Marchesa now saw for the first time, and which the duke\r\npromised should be soon cast in bronze. But the great master's thoughts\r\nwere taking a new direction, and he was already preparing designs for\r\nthe mural painting of the Cenacolo, with which Lodovico had ordered him\r\nto decorate the refectory of the Dominicans in his favourite convent of\r\nS. Maria della Grazie. It was a work after Leonardo's own heart, and he\r\ndetermined to frame an altogether new and original composition, a Last\r\nSupper which should be unlike all others in Italy. This time at least\r\nthe duke's fastidious taste should be satisfied, and the Lombards should\r\nbe made to own that Leonardo the Florentine was an artist who had no\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nAnother of Isabella's favourite artists, Maestro Lorenzo, the gifted\r\norgan-maker, was absent from court, and had left his old home at Pavia\r\nto take up his abode at Venice near his friend Aldo Manuzio, the\r\nprinter. But during this visit the Marchesa saw \"the beautiful and\r\nperfect clavichord\" which he had made for Beatrice, and vowed to leave\r\nno stone unturned until she had obtained a similar one. Unfortunately,\r\nwhen she wrote to inform Messer Lorenzo of her wishes, he was engaged in\r\nmaking a viol for the Duchess of Milan, and had also promised Messer\r\nAntonio Visconti a clavichord, so that he was unable to satisfy the\r\nimpatient Marchesa as quickly as she would have liked. Nothing daunted,\r\nhowever, Isabella returned to the charge, and addressed a letter in her\r\nsweetest and most persuasive strain to Count Antonio Visconti, begging\r\nhim, since her desires were so ardent and she had already waited so\r\nlong, of his courtesy to allow Messer Lorenzo to begin her clavichord as\r\nsoon as Duchess Beatrice's viol should be finished. The count naturally\r\nenough was unable to refuse the request of so charming a princess, and\r\nas usual Isabella got her own way. On Christmas Day, 1496, she wrote\r\njoyously to tell her Venetian agent, Brognolo, that Messer Lorenzo had\r\njust arrived at Mantua, bringing the precious clavichord, which was as\r\nbeautiful and perfect as it could possibly be. But the saddest part of\r\nthe story has yet to be told. After the death of Beatrice, and\r\nLodovico's final ruin, Isabella d'Este remembered the matchless organ\r\nwhich Lorenzo de Pavia had made for her sister, and wrote immediately\r\nto the Pallavicini brothers who had joined in the betrayal of the\r\nCastello, begging them, if possible, to let her have the instrument. A\r\nconsiderable time elapsed before her wish was gratified, but in the end\r\nher perseverance triumphed over all difficulties, and on the last day of\r\nJuly, 1501, she wrote to tell Messer Lorenzo that the beautiful\r\nclavichord which he had made for the Duchess of Milan had been given her\r\nby Galeazzo Pallavicino, the husband of Niccolo da Correggio's\r\nhalf-sister, Elizabeth Sforza, and would be doubly precious to her as\r\nhis work and because of its rare excellence.[58] By a strange fate, the\r\nfragments of this precious clavichord, which was so highly esteemed in\r\nits day, have of late years found their way to the ancient palace of the\r\ndukes of Ferrara in Venice. The instrument which the gifted Pavian made\r\nfor Beatrice, inscribed with the Greek and Latin mottoes chosen by\r\nLorenzo, may still be seen under the roof of her father's old house, in\r\nthose halls where the young duchess once spent that joyous May-time long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nAnother incident which took place at Milan during Isabella's visit, and\r\ncould not fail to inspire her with the keenest interest, was the arrival\r\nof a marble Leda and a number of other antiques that were sent to the\r\nduke from Rome, by the goldsmith Caradosso. After the flight of Piero\r\nde' Medici and the revolution which had taken place in Florence,\r\nLodovico sent this well-known connoisseur to try and acquire some of the\r\npriceless marbles or gems from the Magnificent Lorenzo's collection. But\r\nthe Florentine magistrates wisely declined to part from these objects of\r\nart, which were now the property of the nation, and after Christmas\r\nCaradosso went on to Rome. He arrived there to find the French army in\r\npossession of the city and everything in the greatest confusion, but in\r\nthe end succeeded in securing several valuable antiques. The cardinals,\r\nto whom Caradosso obtained introductions through Ascanio Sforza, were\r\nglad to ingratiate themselves with the powerful Duke of Milan at this\r\ncritical moment, and the artist was able to inform his master that\r\nCardinal di Monreale had given him a marble Leda--a really good antique,\r\nthough some limbs of it were missing--and that other prelates had made\r\nhim liberal offers.\r\n\r\n\"The Cardinal of Parma asked me yesterday what brought me to Rome. I\r\ntold him I had come, by your Excellency's desire, to see if I could find\r\nany beautiful works in bronze or marble that were to be had for gold.\r\nMonsignore asked me if you really cared for these things. I replied,\r\n'Yes, undoubtedly.' Upon which the Most Reverend informed me that he had\r\nan antique statue, and begged me to come and see if I thought that you\r\nwould like it, as if so, he should be glad to send it as a present to\r\nyour Excellency. I have seen it, and it is decidedly good.... Monsignore\r\ndi Sanseverino has promised to show me some fine things, and I hear that\r\nMonsignore Colonna and the Cardinal of Siena have also some good things,\r\nbut, unluckily, they are both of them away from Rome. Since I am here I\r\nmust do my best to play the rogue. I hope to have enough to load a bark\r\nshortly, and send statues to Genoa and to Milan. Meanwhile I should be\r\nglad if you would write and thank the Cardinal of Parma for his statue,\r\nbecause it may induce him to send you some more fine works of art, and\r\nyour gratitude may lead others, who are anxious to gain your\r\nExcellency's favour, to follow his example and send you some more\r\nbeautiful objects, so that the world may become aware how far you\r\nsurpass all other princes both in magnanimity and in the delight which\r\nyou take in this most laudable pursuit. On my return to Florence, I will\r\nmake another effort to obtain some of the precious objects which I saw\r\nthere, and perhaps this time affairs may be in better order, and I may\r\nbe more successful in obeying the orders of your Excellency, to whom I\r\ncommend myself.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your servant,\r\n                                                   CARADOSSO DE MUNDO.\r\n\r\nRoma, February, 1495.\"\r\n\r\nNo one sympathized more truly with Lodovico's passion for collecting\r\nantiques, or appreciated the treasures of art which he had brought\r\ntogether in the Castello, more fully than Isabella d'Este. As before,\r\nthis brilliant princess charmed all hearts at Milan. When she asked a\r\nfavour, whether it was of Count Pallavicino or Madonna Cecilia, of\r\nMesser Lorenzo or Gian Bellini, no one could refuse her prayer. When she\r\nreceived the Venetian ambassadors, the grace and gallantry of her\r\nbearing were irresistible. Whatever she did was done well. Her high\r\nspirits never failed, her strength never seemed to tire. She could ride\r\nall day and dance all night. She could answer Gaspare Visconti's verses\r\nin impromptu rhymes, and keep up animated literary controversies with\r\nNiccolo da Correggio and Messer Galeaz, or discuss grave political\r\nquestions with the duke in the wisest and most sagacious manner. \"As\r\nusual,\" wrote her secretary Capilupi, \"Madonna's gracious ways and\r\nlively conversation have charmed every one here, most of all the Signor\r\nDuca, who calls her his dear daughter, and always makes her dine with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nIf Lodovico took pleasure in Isabella's company, Beatrice's warm heart\r\nglowed with tender affection for the sister whose presence recalled her\r\ndead mother and the home of her youth, while Isabella's love for\r\nchildren could not resist the advances of her little nephew Ercole, who\r\nfollowed his aunt about the rooms of the Castello and made her laugh\r\ntill the tears ran down her cheeks. But the happy peace of these days\r\nwas destined to be rudely disturbed. Suddenly, on the last day of the\r\nmonth, news reached Milan that the King of France had entered Naples and\r\nbeen crowned King of the Sicilies in the cathedral on the 22nd of\r\nFebruary. The young king Ferrante had fled to Ischia with the rest of\r\nthe royal family, and throughout his dominions the people flocked out\r\nalong the roads to hail the victor's coming, and welcomed him with\r\nshouts of joy. Great was the consternation at the Milanese court that\r\nevening, and Isabella wrote to her husband--\r\n\r\n\"So complete and sudden a downfall appears almost impossible both to\r\nthis illustrious lord, the duke, and to us all. It would indeed have\r\nbeen impossible were it not a Divine judgment. This sad case must be an\r\nexample to all the kings and powers of the world, and will, I hope,\r\nteach them to value the love of their subjects more than all their\r\nfortresses, treasures, and men-at-arms, for, as we see now, the\r\ndiscontent of the people is more dangerous to a monarch than all the\r\nmight of his enemies on the battle-field.\"\r\n\r\nThe bad news threw a gloom over the gay party in the Castello. All the\r\npleasure and feasting of the Carnival, all the mirth of the dancing and\r\nfeasting, died away. Isabella and Beatrice thought sadly of their cousin\r\nFerrante, the chivalrous young prince who was a favourite with all his\r\nkinsfolk, and his sister, the widowed Duchess Isabella, shed bitter\r\ntears over this fresh sorrow. Even comedies and pageants lost their old\r\ngaiety and became dull and tedious. \"To me this Carnival seems a\r\nthousand years long,\" sighed Isabella d'Este, in a letter to her\r\nhusband, deploring her prolonged absence and complaining that the duke\r\nwould not allow her to leave before a certain day, fixed by his\r\nastrologer. By the middle of March, however, she returned to Mantua,\r\nfollowed by the most sincere regrets and liveliest expressions of\r\naffection on the part of both her sister and brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\"In all her actions,\" wrote Lodovico to the Marquis of Mantua, \"this\r\nworthy Madonna has shown so much charm and excellence, that, although we\r\nrejoice to think you will soon enjoy her presence, we cannot but feel\r\ngreat regret at the loss of her sweet company, and when she leaves us\r\nto-morrow, I must confess we shall seem to be deprived of a part of\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a week later Beatrice wrote to her sister, \"I cannot tell you often\r\nenough how strange and sad the departure of your Highness has seemed to\r\nme this time. Wherever I turn, in the house or out-of-doors, I seem to\r\nsee your face before my eyes, and when I find myself deceived, and\r\nrealize that you are really gone, you will understand how sore my\r\ndistress has been--nay, how great it still is. And you, I think, will\r\nhave felt the same grief, because of the love between us. Even little\r\nErcole misses you, and keeps on asking continually in his childish\r\nfashion for his aunt, and crying '_Cia, cia!_' and he seems quite lost\r\nwhen he cannot find you anywhere.\"[59]\r\n\r\nBeatrice's strange and sad forebodings were destined to prove all too\r\ntrue. That was Isabella's last visit to her brother-in-law's court, and\r\nthe sisters never met again. When, thirteen years afterwards, the\r\nMarchesa returned once more to Milan and danced in the halls of the\r\nCastello, she came as the guest of Louis XII., the king who had\r\nconquered Lodovico's fair duchy and brought about the ruin of the house\r\nof Sforza. Beatrice had long been dead, her children were in exile, and\r\nthe Moro was wearing his heart out in lonely captivity within the gloomy\r\nprison walls of Loches.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 622.\r\n\r\n[58] C. dell'Acqua, _Lorenzo Gusnasco_, pp. 19, 20.\r\n\r\n[59] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, pp. 622, 623.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nProclamation of the new league against France at Venice--Charles VIII.\r\nat Naples--Demoralization of the victors--Charles leaves Naples and\r\nreturns to Rome--The Duke of Orleans refuses to give up Asti--Arrival of\r\nthe imperial ambassadors at Milan--Lodovico presented with the ducal\r\ninsignia--_Fêtes_ in the Castello--The Duke of Orleans seizes\r\nNovara--Terror of Lodovico--Battle of Fornovo--Victory claimed by both\r\nparties--The French reach Asti--Isabella's trophies restored by\r\nBeatrice.\r\n\r\n1495\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 27th of February, while the joy bells were ringing\r\nin the Milanese churches in honour of the French king's triumph, the\r\nduke sent for the Venetian ambassadors.\r\n\r\n\"I have had bad news,\" he said. \"Naples is lost, and the French king has\r\nbeen joyfully welcomed by the people. I am ready to do whatever the\r\nRepublic desires. But there is no time to waste; we must act at once.\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes now turned to Lodovico as the only man who could save Italy\r\nfrom the French invaders. The emperor and the Venetians had been urging\r\nhim to declare war against France for the last eight weeks, and now\r\nFerrante of Aragon, in his despair, appealed to him by the Sforza blood\r\nthat flowed in both their veins to deliver him and his kingdom from the\r\ndominion of the foreigner. The duke himself could not feel safe as long\r\nas Louis of Orleans remained at Asti, and declared that he was ready to\r\nplace himself at the head of a league for the defence of Italy. He wrote\r\nto congratulate Commines, the French ambassador at Venice, on his\r\nmaster's success, but the same day he sent the Bishop of Como and\r\nFrancesco Bernardino Visconti to Venice, there to negotiate a new league\r\nbetween himself, the Signoria, the Pope, the King of the Romans, and\r\nthe King and Queen of Spain. The presence of the German and Spanish\r\nambassadors, as well as the arrival of the two new Milanese envoys,\r\nexcited Commines' suspicions, while the long faces and terror-struck air\r\nof the Venetian senators, when the news from Naples arrived, reminded\r\nhim of the Romans after the defeat of Cannæ. But so well was the secret\r\nkept that he knew nothing of the league until after it had been signed,\r\nlate on the night of the 31st of March, in the bedchamber of the old\r\nDoge. Early the next morning he was summoned to the palace, and, in the\r\npresence of a hundred senators, solemnly informed of the new treaty.\r\n\r\n\"Magnificent ambassador,\" said the prince, \"our friendship for your\r\nmaster makes it our duty to inform you of all that concerns the state.\r\nKnow, then, that yesterday, in the name of the Holy Spirit, of the\r\nglorious Virgin Mary, and the blessed Evangelist Monsignore S. Marco,\r\nour patron, a league has been concluded for the protection of the Church\r\nand the defence of the Holy Roman Empire and your own states, between\r\nhis Holiness the Pope, his Majesty the King of the Romans, the King and\r\nQueen of Spain, our Signoria, and the Duke of Milan. Tell this, we pray\r\nyou, to your Most Christian Majesty.\" Before the prince had done\r\nspeaking, Commines heard the bells of St. Mark's ringing to celebrate\r\nthe new league, and, still dazed by the unexpected news, he stammered\r\nout, \"What will happen to my king? Will he be able to return to France?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the prince, \"if he comes as a friend to the\r\nleague.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word, Commines left the palace, but as he went down the\r\ngrand staircase, he asked the secretary who accompanied him to repeat\r\nthe Doge's words, since he could hardly take them in. Then he told his\r\ngondoliers to row him back to his house, near S. Giorgio Maggiore, and\r\non the way he met the ambassador of Naples, in a fine new robe, with a\r\nsmiling face, as he well might have, \"for this,\" adds Commines, \"was\r\ngreat news for him.\" Marino Sanuto, who narrates the incident, was much\r\nstruck by Commines' rage and dismay, and, like a true Venetian, remarks\r\ncontemptuously, \"He did not know how to dissimulate his feelings, as one\r\nshould do in such a case.\" And, in the same spirit, he goes on to\r\nadmire the presence of mind displayed by the Milanese ambassadors, who\r\nto all Commines' remonstrances replied courteously, that of course their\r\nduke had nothing to do with all this. \"They acted,\" he adds, \"as the\r\nwise act in the government of states. They persuade their enemies that\r\nthey mean to do one thing, and then they do another.\"\r\n\r\nAt night all Venice was illuminated, and from his covered gondola the\r\nFrench ambassador saw the fireworks and the banquetings that were held\r\nat the palaces of the other envoys. He understood what it all meant, and\r\ntrembled for his king's safety. But he lost no time, and sent warnings\r\nboth to Orleans at Asti and to Charles at Naples, of the coming storm. A\r\nweek or two later he left Venice, and went to meet Charles at Florence.\r\nOn Palm Sunday, the 10th of April, the League was solemnly proclaimed on\r\nthe Piazza of St. Mark, and all the ambassadors marched in procession\r\nround the square, while images of united Italy, and of all the kings and\r\nprinces of the League, were carried about in triumph, and the golden\r\nrose was given by the Pope to the Venetian ambassador in Rome. \"To-day,\"\r\nsaid the Duke of Milan, \"will see the dawn of the peace and prosperity\r\nof Italy.\"\r\n\r\nKing Charles, meanwhile, unconscious of the dangers that threatened to\r\nimpede his return home, was revelling in the delights of Naples, and\r\nholding jousts and banquets in the sunny gardens and fair palaces of\r\nthat enchanted bay. \"My brother,\" he wrote to the Duke of Bourbon, \"this\r\nis the divinest land and the fairest city that I have ever seen. You\r\nwould never believe what beautiful gardens I have here. So delicious are\r\nthey, and so full of rare and lovely flowers and fruits, that nothing,\r\nby my faith, is wanting, except Adam and Eve, to make this place another\r\nEden.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the king and his nobles were eating off gold and silver plate and\r\ndrinking out of jewelled goblets in King Alfonso's tapestried halls, the\r\nFrench soldiers were to be seen lying about in the streets, intoxicated\r\nwith the strong and luscious wines of Southern Italy. The whole army was\r\ngiven over to luxury and vice, and the outrages which the troops\r\ncommitted soon made them hated by the fickle populace, who a few weeks\r\nbefore had welcomed them as deliverers from the tyrant's yoke. \"From the\r\nmoment of the king's arrival until his departure,\" writes Commines, \"he\r\nthought of nothing but pleasure, and those about him only cared to seek\r\ntheir own profit. His youth may excuse him, but for his servants there\r\ncould be no excuse.\" The news of the league between the powers came to\r\nstartle Charles out of this fool's paradise. On the 8th of April, the\r\nCount of Caiazzo was suddenly recalled to Milan, and when Charles asked\r\nLodovico to send him Messer Galeazzo instead, the duke replied curtly\r\nthat he had need of him at home. By degrees the king began to realize\r\nthe formidable combination which had arisen against him, and prepared to\r\nmarch northward with the bulk of his army, leaving the Duke of\r\nMontpensier with a few hundred French troops and some thousand Swiss\r\nmercenaries to defend his newly conquered kingdom. On the 20th of May,\r\nhe finally left Naples, and on the 1st of June entered Rome by the Latin\r\ngate, two days after the Pope had fled to Orvieto. Almost at the same\r\nmoment, King Ferrante returned to Calabria, and his subjects flocked to\r\njoin the old banner of the house of Aragon.\r\n\r\nLodovico's first step was to send Galeazzo di Sanseverino with a body of\r\nnewly raised troops against Asti, on the 19th of April, and to summon\r\nthe Duke of Orleans to surrender the town and to drop the title of Duke\r\nof Milan. In this he was supported by the Emperor Maximilian, who sent\r\nan imperious order to Louis forbidding him to assume the title, on pain\r\nof forfeiting his fief of Asti. Orleans replied proudly that Asti formed\r\npart of his heritage, and that he was ready to defend it to the last\r\ndrop of his blood against Signor Lodovico or any other foe. At the same\r\ntime he sent an urgent appeal to the Duke of Bourbon for reinforcements,\r\nand prepared to act on the offensive.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of the same month, the Duke of Milan wrote a gay letter to\r\nIsabella d'Este, informing her of his intention to attack Asti, and\r\nregretting that she was not present to join the expedition on her fleet\r\ncharger. But Asti was too strongly fortified, and the forces under\r\nGaleazzo were too raw and ill paid, for him to attempt an assault; so he\r\nremained in his camp at Annona, and contented himself with cutting off\r\nthe supplies of the beleaguered city.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April, the imperial envoys were at length despatched\r\nwith the long-promised privileges, and in the middle of May they reached\r\nMilan, where they were magnificently entertained by the duke and duchess\r\nin the Castello. On the 26th of May, the festival of S. Felicissimo, the\r\ngreat ceremony took place. An imposing tribunal, hung with crimson satin\r\nembroidered with gold mulberry leaves and berries, was erected for the\r\noccasion on the piazza at the doors of the Duomo, and here, after\r\nattending high mass, Lodovico Sforza was solemnly proclaimed Duke of\r\nMilan, Count of Pavia and Angera, by the grace of God and the will of\r\nhis Cesarean Majesty, Maximilian, Emperor-elect and chief of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire. The imperial delegates, Melchior, Bishop of Brixen, and\r\nConrad Stürzl, Chancellor of the King of the Romans, first read aloud\r\nthe privileges in their master's name, and then invested Lodovico with\r\nthe ducal cap and mantle, and placed the sceptre and sword of state in\r\nhis hands. Giasone del Maino, the celebrated Pavian jurist, recited a\r\nLatin oration, after which the duke, accompanied by the imperial\r\nambassadors, and followed by the duchess and a brilliant suite of\r\ncourtiers and ladies, rode in procession to the ancient basilica of S.\r\nAmbrogio to return thanks for his accession. Then the whole company\r\nreturned, \"with immense rejoicing and triumph,\" to the Castello, where a\r\nseries of splendid _fêtes_ were given in honour of the occasion, and\r\nrich presents were made to the imperial ambassadors and court officials.\r\nTwo days afterwards another imposing ceremony was held in the Castello,\r\nwhen the heads of houses from the different quarters of the city were\r\nassembled, and each citizen in turn swore fealty, first to Duke Lodovico\r\nand afterwards to Duchess Beatrice, whom, in the event of his own death,\r\nhe had appointed to be regent of the State and guardian of his sons. The\r\nMarquis of Mantua was among the guests present, and Beatrice felt the\r\nkeenest regret that the marchioness was unable to accompany him and\r\nwitness the wonderful scene before the Duomo, which, she exclaims in her\r\nyouthful enthusiasm,\" was the grandest spectacle and noblest solemnity\r\nthat our eyes have ever beheld.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the proudest day of Lodovico's life, and his adored wife, who\r\nshared the cares of State as well as the festivities of his court, might\r\nwell join in his exultation. But his confidence in the favours of\r\nFortune and in the security of his position was destined to receive a\r\nrude shock. Before the week was ended, on the very day when Beatrice\r\nwrote her triumphant letter to her sister, Louis of Orleans,\r\nstrengthened by the arrival of fresh troops, made a successful sally\r\nfrom Asti at nightfall and appeared before the walls of Novara. The\r\ncitizens, who were already disaffected by reason of the oppressive\r\nexactions of the Duke of Milan, opened their gates, and after a short\r\nsiege the citadel surrendered. Suddenly the Duke of Milan, who was\r\nresting after the fatigues of the recent festivities at Vigevano, heard\r\nthat his rival, at the head of a strongly armed force, was within twenty\r\nmiles of his palace gates. An irresistible panic seized him, and he\r\nretired, first to Abbiategrasso, beyond the Ticino, and then to Milan,\r\nwhere he took refuge in the Castello with his wife and children. The\r\nVenetian annalist Malipiero records how, on the 20th of June, two\r\nLombard friars arrived at the convent of San Salvador in Venice,\r\nbringing word that the duke had fled in terror of his life to the Rocca,\r\nand would hardly see or speak to a single soul. \"He is in bad health,\r\nwith one hand paralyzed, they say, and is hated by all the people, and\r\nfears they will rise against him.\" In this critical moment, Beatrice\r\nshowed a courage and presence of mind which contrasted curiously with\r\nher husband's weakness. She sent for the chief Milanese noblemen, spoke\r\nbrave words to them, and took prompt measures for defending the Castello\r\nand city. Fortunately, the Venetian general, Bernardo Contarini, arrived\r\non the 22nd of June at the head of several thousand Greek Stradiots to\r\nthe duke's assistance, while the French were held in check by Galeazzo's\r\nforce and compelled to remain within the walls of Novara. This momentary\r\npanic over, Lodovico recovered his health and nerve, but his treasury\r\nwas exhausted by the large subsidies granted to his allies and the\r\nextravagant expenditure of the last two years, and the forced loans\r\nwhich he exacted from his subjects created a general feeling of\r\ndiscontent. Galeazzo's force was weakened by continual desertion, and\r\nthe duke had great difficulty in raising sufficient money to maintain\r\ntwo separate armies. Rumours of the disaffection of the Milanese and of\r\nthe perils which threatened his ally had reached Maximilian's ears at\r\nWorms, and on the 18th of June he sent Lodovico a grave warning by his\r\nenvoy, Angelo Talenti, begging the duke to place German troops in the\r\nfortress of Lombardy, and to provide guards for the castles of Milan and\r\nComo, \"in order that he may be able to sleep in peace.\" Two days later\r\nhe spoke again to the envoy, and begged him to urge the duke to remove\r\nhis womankind from the Castello to Cremona, where he heard that he had a\r\nfine palace, saying that the presence of women had often caused the loss\r\nof citadels. Perhaps, if Maximilian had known Duchess Beatrice as well\r\nas he did a year later, he would have thought this warning superfluous.\r\nLodovico, however, thanked his Majesty for his thoughtfulness, and\r\napplied himself, with the help of Leonardo, to fortify the Castello of\r\nMilan and make it an impregnable citadel. That winter he had appointed\r\nBernardino del Corte, one of his favourite and most devoted servants, to\r\nbe governor of the Rocca, which held his treasure and jewels together\r\nwith all his most precious possessions, and on the 12th of January, a\r\nfortnight before the birth of Beatrice's child, the new castellan had\r\ntaken a solemn oath of fealty to the duke and duchess, swearing, with\r\nhis hand on the crucifix, that he would hold the Castello for his liege\r\nlord and lady till his latest breath. Messer Galeazzo and his brother,\r\nAntonio Maria di Sanseverino, Giasone del Maino, Ambrogio di Rosate, the\r\nastrologer, Galeotto Prince of Mirandola, and Giovanni Adorno, a\r\npowerful Genoese nobleman, who had married a sister of the Sanseverini\r\nbrothers, were all present in Beatrice's room in the Rocchetta on this\r\noccasion, and signed the document as witnesses of Bernardino's oath.\r\n\r\nMaximilian now sent his long-promised contingent of Swiss and German\r\ntroops to join the Count of Caiazzo's horse, and the Venetian army,\r\nunder the generalship of Gian Francesco Gonzaga, and the allied forces,\r\namounting in all to some twenty-five thousand men, prepared to cut off\r\nthe retreat of the French king and prevent his return to Asti. \"Here I\r\nam,\" wrote the Marquis of Mantua to his wife, \"at the head of the finest\r\narmy which Italy has ever seen, not only to resist, but to exterminate\r\nthe French.\" And Isabella wrote back in high spirits at the \"great\r\nenterprise\" that was before him, sending him a cross with an Agnus Dei\r\nto wear round his neck in battle, and telling him that her prayers and\r\nthose of all the priests of Mantua were with him.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 5th of July, the French army, reduced by sickness and\r\ndesertion to less than ten thousand in number, and fatigued by long\r\nforced marches across the Apennines, descended into the valley of the\r\nTaro, and encamped at the village of Fornovo, on the right bank of the\r\nmountain torrent. Further along the same bank, down in the plains, lay\r\nthe army of the league, and, in order to reach Lombardy, the French had\r\nto cross the river in full view of the enemy's camp. Early on Monday\r\nmorning, the 6th of July, Charles, mounted on his favourite charger,\r\n\"Savoy,\" and wearing white and purple plumes in his cap, led the van of\r\nhis army across the Taro, swollen as it was by the late heavy rains. At\r\nthe same moment, the Marquis of Mantua and the Count of Caiazzo, at the\r\nhead of their light cavalry, attacked the French rear-guard, and the\r\nbattle began. Paolo Giovio describes the engagement that followed as the\r\nfiercest battle of the age, in which more blood was spilt than in any\r\nother during the last two hundred years, although Commines, who was\r\npresent with his monarch, says that the actual fighting only lasted a\r\nquarter of an hour. On both sides the leaders fought with heroic\r\ncourage. Charles VIII. himself repeatedly led the charge against the\r\nMilanese horse, and, calling on the chivalry of France to live or die\r\nwith him, dashed into the thickest of the fray. Once mounted on his\r\nwar-horse, and face to face with the foe, the ugly little deformed man\r\nbecame a true king, and risked his life and liberty at the head of his\r\nsubjects. Francesco Gonzaga, on his part, performed prodigies of valour,\r\nand had three horses killed under him, while his uncle, Rodolfo Gonzaga,\r\nand many other gallant knights were left dead on the field. But personal\r\nexploits could not atone for his want of generalship, and while the\r\nmarquis and his immediate followers were engaged in a desperate\r\nhand-to-hand fight with the foe, a large body of his reserve remained\r\ninactive on the banks of the Taro, and his Stradiots were engaged in\r\nplundering the French camp. The result was that, in spite of their\r\nsuperior numbers, the Italian ranks were broken and many of the\r\nVenetians fled in confusion towards Parma, while the French succeeded in\r\ncrossing the river, and, early on Tuesday morning, continued their march\r\nacross the Lombard plain. But, as the camp and baggage remained in the\r\nhands of the allies, the Italians claimed the victory. The Venetians\r\ncelebrated their triumph with public rejoicings and illuminations on the\r\nPiazza of S. Marco, and lauded their brave captain to the skies. Both at\r\nMilan and Mantua there was great exultation when the news became known;\r\npoets and painters alike did honour to the victors: Sperandio designed\r\nhis noble medal, and Mantegna painted the Madonna della Vittoria to\r\nimmortalize Francesco Gonzaga's triumph. But the marquis himself,\r\nwriting to his wife from the camp the day after the battle, remarks that\r\nif only others had fought as he and his followers did, the victory would\r\nhave been complete, and laments the disobedience and cowardice of the\r\nStradiots, who first plundered the enemy's camp and then fled, although\r\nno one pursued them. \"These things,\" he adds, \"have caused me the\r\ngreatest grief that I have ever known.\"\r\n\r\nLodovico's congratulations on the victory were coldly worded, and evoked\r\na reply from his brother-in-law, saying that if he had foiled in\r\ncourage, he would have been a dead man. But the duke could not forgive\r\nGonzaga for allowing the French to pursue their way unmolested. Only the\r\nCount of Caiazzo and his brothers had attempted to follow them with\r\ntheir light cavalry, who were too few in number to do the enemy serious\r\ndamage, and by the 8th of July, Charles and his tired army reached Asti\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\n\"God Himself was our guide,\" devoutly ejaculates Commines, \"and led us\r\nhome with honour, as that good man Fra Girolamo of Florence had\r\nforetold. But, as he said truly, we were made to suffer for our sins,\r\nfor we were in sore need of food, and so great was our want of water\r\nthat men drank of the ditches along the road; but no one was heard to\r\ncomplain, although it was the hardest journey I ever took in my life,\r\nand I have had many bad ones.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the booty which fell into the hands of the marquis after the\r\nbattle was the French king's tent with all its contents. These included\r\na sword and helmet, said to have belonged to Charlemagne, a silver\r\ncasket containing the royal seals, besides a set of rich hangings and\r\naltar-plate, and a jewelled cross and reliquary on which Charles set\r\ngreat value, because it held a sacred thorn and piece of wood from the\r\nholy cross, a vest of our Lady, and a limb of St. Denis, which were\r\nobjects of his especial devotion. Many of these relics were eventually\r\nrestored to the king, who, not to be outdone in courtesy, sent the\r\nmarquis a favourite white horse of his, which had been captured by the\r\nFrench, gorgeously apparelled in gold trappings. Among the spoils sent\r\nto Mantua were a magnificent set of embroidered hangings from the royal\r\ntent, and a curious book of paintings, containing portraits of the chief\r\nItalian beauties who had fascinated King Charles. These, together with\r\nthe hilt of the broken sword with which the marquis himself had fought\r\nin the _mêlèe_, were joyfully received by Isabella, who counted these\r\ntrophies among her proudest possessions. She was, accordingly, a good\r\ndeal annoyed when, a week later, her husband desired her to send back\r\nthe French king's hangings, as he wished to give them to her sister\r\nBeatrice. Her protest on this occasion is very characteristic.\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LORD,\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency has desired me to send the four pieces of drapery that\r\nbelonged to the French king, in order that you may present them to the\r\nDuchess of Milan. I of course obey you, but in this instance I must say\r\nI do it with great reluctance, as I think these royal spoils ought to\r\nremain in our family, in perpetual memory of your glorious deeds, of\r\nwhich we have no other record here. By giving them to others, you appear\r\nto surrender the honour of the enterprise with these trophies of the\r\nvictory. I do not send them to-day, because they require a mule, and I\r\nalso hope that you will be able to make some excuse to the duchess and\r\ntell her, for instance, that you have already given me these hangings.\r\nIf I had not seen them already, I should not have cared so much; but\r\nsince you gave them to me in the first place, and they were won at the\r\nperil of your own life, I shall only give them up with tears in my eyes.\r\nAll the same, as I said before, I will obey your Excellency, but shall\r\nhope to receive some explanation in reply. If these draperies were a\r\nthousand times more valuable than they are, and had been acquired in any\r\nother way, I should gladly give them up to my sister the duchess, whom,\r\nas you know, I love and honour with all my heart. But, under the\r\ncircumstances, I must own it is very hard for me to part with them.\r\n\r\n\"Mantua, July 24, 1495.\"\r\n\r\nIn this case Beatrice showed herself, as she habitually was, the more\r\ngenerous of the two. The marquis had his way, and sent the four hangings\r\nto Milan, followed by a fifth belonging to the suite, which he had in\r\nthe mean time recovered.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of August, Beatrice, having duly received and admired her\r\nbrother-in-law's gift, sent them all back to Mantua, with the following\r\nnote, thanking him for his kindness, but declining to accept a present\r\nthat she felt belonged of right to her sister:--\r\n\r\n\"I have to-day received, by your Highness's courier, one of the pieces\r\nof drapery belonging to the King of France. Andrea Cossa had already\r\nbrought me the other four, for which I thank you exceedingly; but I feel\r\nthat, under the circumstances, I ought not to keep them. As it is, I\r\nhave great pleasure in seeing them all together, and now your Highness\r\ncan give them back to the Marchesana.\"[60]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, pp. 632, 633.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nFerrante II. recovers Naples--Siege of Novara by the army of the league\r\n--Review of the army by the Duke and Duchess of Milan--Charles VIII.\r\nvisits Turin and comes to Vercelli--Negotiations for peace--Lodovic and\r\nBeatrice at the camp--Treaty of Vercelli concluded between France and\r\nMilan--Jealousy of the other Powers--Commines at Vigevano--Zenale's\r\naltar-piece in the Brera.\r\n\r\n1495\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the failure of the league to cut off the French king's return to\r\nFornovo had disappointed Lodovico, he found compensation in the news\r\nthat reached Milan from Naples. Hardly had Charles VIII. started on his\r\nmarch northwards, than Ferrante once more set foot in his own realm and\r\nreceived a joyful welcome from his subjects. On the 7th of July, the day\r\nafter the battle of the Taro, he entered Naples, where the people took\r\nup arms in his favour, and the nobles who had been the first to join the\r\nFrench king hastened to assure him of their loyalty. One by one the\r\ncastles in the neighbourhood surrendered to their rightful king, and\r\nMontpensier with the remnant of his forces retired into the Calabrian\r\nfastnesses, to carry on a petty war of depredation and skirmishes during\r\nthe winter months. Lodovico hastened to impart the good news to his\r\nsister-in-law Isabella, who replied in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS DUKE OF MILAN AND DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n\"The news of King Ferrante's entry into Naples, which your Highness was\r\nso good as to send me, has given me the greatest pleasure, both for his\r\nMajesty's own sake and for that of your Highness, since it seems to me\r\nthat all this must help to deliver us the more speedily from the hands\r\nof the French. So I congratulate myself with your Excellency, and thank\r\nyou with all my heart for your kindness in allowing me to share the good\r\nnews, which has indeed given me the greatest happiness. I only hope that\r\nyou may soon receive tidings of the recovery of Novara, and begging you\r\nto keep me informed of your successes, and to commend me cordially to my\r\nsister the duchess,\r\n\r\n                              \"I remain, your daughter and servant,\r\n                                                ISABELLA DA ESTE.\"[61]\r\n\r\nWritten with my own hand in Mantua on the 16th of July, 1495.\"\r\n\r\nThe siege of Novara, where the Duke of Orleans had been beleagured since\r\nthe middle of June, was now the centre of interest in Lombardy.\r\nImmediately after Fornovo, the Count of Caiazzo's cavalry had joined his\r\nbrother Galeazzo's force before Novara, and on the 19th of July the\r\nMarquis of Mantua encamped under the walls with the Venetian army. The\r\ngarrison of the besieged city was six or seven thousand strong, and well\r\nprovided with arms and ammunition, but already supplies of food were\r\nscarce, and men and horses were dying of sickness and hunger. Some\r\ndissensions having arisen between Francesco Gonzaga and the other\r\nleaders as to the conduct of the siege, the Duke of Milan himself\r\nvisited the camp of the league on the 3rd of August, bringing with him,\r\nsays Guicciardini, his beloved wife--\"_la sua carissima consorte_\"--who\r\nwas his companion \"no less in matters of importance than in actions\r\nfamiliar, and who on this occasion, it is said, chiefly by her advice\r\nand counsel brought the captains to an agreement.\" A council of war was\r\nheld, and Lodovico's recommendation to blockade the town instead of\r\ncarrying it by assault was finally adopted. On the 5th of August the\r\nduke and duchess were present at a grand review of the whole army,\r\nwhich, with Galeazzo's troops and the German and Swiss reinforcements,\r\nnow amounted to upwards of forty thousand men. Never in the memory of\r\nman, say the chroniclers, had so great and splendid an army been seen in\r\nItaly as that which, with flying colours and beating drums, to the sound\r\nof trumpets and martial music, marched past the chariot of Duchess\r\nBeatrice. First came the hero of Fornovo, Francesco Gonzaga, at the head\r\nof his troop of horse, mounted on magnificent chargers, \"a sight\r\nadmirable to behold;\" then the infantry, all in excellent order, led by\r\ntheir different Condottieri, in glittering armour; afterwards the\r\nartillery, firing big guns, which seemed to rend the air; then the\r\nStradiots armed with lances, targets, and scimitars, and the Venetian\r\ncross-bowmen and light cavalry. These were followed by Galeazzo di\r\nSanseverino, who looked his best that day, clad in French attire as a\r\nknight of the Order of St. Michel--for which, we are told, he was\r\nsharply reprimanded by the duke--followed by the flower of Milanese\r\nchivalry, bearing in their midst the ducal banner with the figure of a\r\nMoor, holding an eagle in one hand and strangling a dragon with the\r\nother. After Messer Galeaz came his brothers, Antonio Maria and\r\nFracassa, \"_ce très-beau et très-gracieux gendarme_,\" as Commines calls\r\nhim, each leading his own squadron; and finally the German infantry,\r\nconsisting of some five or six thousand men.\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed,\" writes the Neapolitan scholar, Jacopo d'Atri, who was\r\nin attendance on his master, the Marquis of Mantua, \"a stupendous sight,\r\nand all who were present say that since the days of the Romans, so vast\r\nand well-disciplined an army has never been seen.\" And the Marquis of\r\nMantua, in his letters, never ceased to regret his wife's absence,\r\ntelling her that she had missed the grandest sight in the world, a thing\r\nthe like of which she would never see again.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback to the day's success was an accident which befell the\r\nduke's horse, who stumbled and fell as Lodovico passed along the lines,\r\nthrowing his rider to the ground, and soiling his rich clothes in the\r\nmud. \"This,\" remarks the chronicler who tells the story, \"was held to be\r\nan evil omen, and was remembered afterwards by many who were present\r\nthat day.\" After this review, the duke and duchess returned to Vigevano,\r\nand the siege of Novara was prosecuted with fresh vigour. In vain Louis\r\nof Orleans and his famished soldiers looked out for the French army that\r\nwas to bring them relief. King Charles had gone to visit his ally the\r\nDuchess of Savoy at Turin, and was consoling himself for the toil and\r\ndisappointments of the campaign by making love to fair Anna Solieri in\r\nthe neighbouring town of Chieri. Since his reduced forces were unequal\r\nto the task of facing the army of the league and relieving Novara, he\r\nsent the bailiff of Dijon to raise a body of twelve thousand Swiss in\r\nthe Cantons friendly to France, and decided to await their arrival\r\nbefore he took active measures.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he and most of his followers were thoroughly tired of warfare,\r\nand the queen never ceased imploring him to return home. The French\r\nsupplies of men and money were exhausted, and when Charles sent home for\r\nreinforcements, Anne of Brittany replied that there were no Frenchmen\r\nleft to send, only widows weeping for their husbands, whose bones were\r\nwhitening on the Italian plains. The Venetian ambassador, Commines, who\r\nwas strongly in favour of peace, had already opened negotiations with\r\nsome of his friends in Venice, and Charles lent a willing ear both to\r\nhis proposals and to those of the Duchess of Savoy, who on her part\r\noffered to mediate between him and the Duke of Milan. But Briconnet, the\r\nCardinal of S. Malo, Lodovico's old enemy and a staunch partisan of\r\nOrleans, defeated these plans by his intrigues, and the French army,\r\nleaving Asti, advanced to Vercelli, in the duchy of Savoy, and prepared\r\nto take the field. Both parties, however, were growing weary of this\r\nprolonged warfare, and Commines declares that in the French camp no one\r\nwanted to fight, unless the king led them to battle, and that Charles\r\nhimself had not the slightest wish to take the field.\r\n\r\nAt length, early in September, the first detachment of Swiss levies\r\nreached Vercelli, and on the 12th the king himself arrived in the camp.\r\nHis first act was to hold a council of war, which decided in favour of\r\npeace, and Commines was sent to treat with the Marquis of Mantua. The\r\nallies insisted on the unconditional surrender of Novara, while Charles\r\nVIII. asked for the restitution of Genoa as an ancient fief of the\r\nFrench crown. Nothing was concluded, but a truce of eight days was\r\nagreed upon, and prolonged conferences were held at a castle between\r\nVercelli and Cameriano.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, Lodovico returned to the camp of the league,\r\nbringing Beatrice with him, and rode out to meet the French\r\ncommissioners. Commines gives a minute account of the conferences, which\r\ntook place in the duke's lodgings at Cameriano during the next\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n\"Every day the duke and duchess came to meet us at the end of a long\r\ngallery and conducted us to their rooms, where we found two long rows of\r\nchairs prepared, and we sat down on one side, and the representatives of\r\nthe league on the other. First came the ambassadors of the King of the\r\nRomans and the King of Spain; then the Marquis of Mantua and the\r\nVenetian Provveditori and envoy; then the Duke of Milan and his wife the\r\nduchess, seated between him and the ambassador of Ferrara. On their\r\nside, the duke was the only spokesman, and on our side one only. But our\r\nhabit is not to speak as quietly as they do; two or three of us often\r\nbegan to speak at the same time, which made the duke say, 'Ho! ho! if\r\nyou please, one at a time.' And two secretaries, one of ours and one of\r\ntheirs, wrote down the articles agreed upon, and before we took leave,\r\nread them aloud, the one in Italian, the other in French, to see if\r\nthere was anything that could be altered or shortened.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice was present at all the deliberations, and surprised the other\r\ncommissioners by her cleverness and quickness, and the ready tact she\r\ninvariably showed. The duke was now sincerely anxious for peace, and\r\nonly cared to recover Novara, and to see the French safely out of his\r\ndominions, where the presence of Louis of Orleans could not fail to\r\nprove a disturbing element. Both he and Commines directed all their\r\nefforts to bring matters to a favourable conclusion, but the other\r\ncommissioners made difficulties, and the Venetian, Spanish, and German\r\nambassadors would decide nothing without consulting their separate\r\ngovernments. The evacuation of Novara, however, was unanimously agreed\r\nupon, and on the 26th of September, Orleans and his garrison marched out\r\nwith the honours of war, and were escorted by Messer Galeaz and the\r\nMarquis of Mantua to the French outposts. More than two thousand men had\r\nalready died of sickness and starvation. Almost all their horses had\r\nbeen eaten, and the survivors were in a miserable plight. Many perished\r\nby the roadside, and Commines found fifty troopers in a fainting\r\ncondition in a garden at Cameriano, and saved their lives by feeding\r\nthem with soup. Even then one man died on the spot, and four others\r\nnever reached the camp. Three hundred more died at Vercelli, some of\r\nsickness, others from over-eating themselves after the prolonged\r\nstarvation which they had endured, and the dung-hills of the town were\r\nstrewn with dead corpses. Yet still Orleans, who, as Commines remarks,\r\nhad caused all this mischief, was eager for war, and entreated the king\r\nto make no terms with Signor Lodovico. He had a strong supporter in the\r\nMilanese captain, Jean Jacques Trivulzio, who had entered the French\r\nking's service after Alfonso's flight from Naples, and had never\r\nforgotten his old griefs against Lodovico and his son-in-law. And on the\r\nselfsame day that Novara was evacuated, the bailiff of Dijon arrived at\r\nVercelli with ten or twelve thousand more Swiss mercenaries, bringing up\r\nthe whole number to upwards of twenty thousand. So large a body had\r\nnever been assembled before, and the presence of these rude\r\nmountaineers, greedy for spoil and ready to quarrel with friends or\r\nfoes, created general alarm. The Duke of Milan was now more eager than\r\never to conclude peace, and when Louis of Orleans and Trivulzio urged\r\nthe king to break off negotiations and march at the head of the Swiss on\r\nMilan, Charles replied curtly that it was too late, for the\r\npreliminaries of peace were already signed. He himself had no wish but\r\nto return home and send help to his distressed troops in Naples.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 9th of October a separate convention was concluded\r\nbetween the King of France and the Duke of Milan, leaving the other\r\nPowers to settle their differences among themselves. Novara was restored\r\nto Lodovico, and his title to Genoa and Savona recognized, while Charles\r\nrenounced the support of his cousin Louis of Orleans' claims upon Milan.\r\nIn return the duke promised not to assist Ferrante with troops or ships,\r\nto give free passage to French armies, and assist the king with Milanese\r\ntroops if he returned to Naples in person. He further renounced his\r\nclaim on Asti, and agreed to pay the Duke of Orleans 50,000 ducats as a\r\nwar indemnity, and lend the king two ships as transports for his\r\nsoldiers from Genoa to Naples. A debt of 80,000 ducats, that was still\r\nowing to Lodovico, was cancelled, and the Castelletto of the port of\r\nGenoa was placed in the Duke of Ferrara's hands, as a security that\r\nthese engagements would be kept on both sides. The king, we learn from\r\nCommines, still retained a friendly feeling for the Duke of Milan, and\r\ninvited him to a meeting before he left Italy; but Lodovico had taken\r\numbrage at certain offensive remarks made by the Count of Ligny and\r\nCardinal Briconnet, and excused himself on plea of illness, while he\r\ndeclared in private that he would not trust himself in the French king's\r\ncompany unless a river ran between them. \"It is true,\" says Commines,\r\n\"that foolish words had been spoken, but the king meant well, and wished\r\nto remain his friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Mantua was better disposed towards his Most Christian\r\nMajesty, and gladly accepted an invitation to visit the king at Vercelli\r\nbefore his departure. He wrote to his wife in great haste, begging her\r\nto send him his finest linen shirts and best gold brocade vest and\r\nmantle, together with different sorts of choice perfumes, and the next\r\nday duly made his obeisance to the king. He was highly gratified at the\r\ncourtesy with which he was received, and at the familiar way in which\r\nhis Majesty conversed, not only with himself, but with his servants,\r\n\"treating them exactly as if they were his equals\" and condescending to\r\nlift his hand to his cap each time they saluted him.\" What impressed\r\nthis rough soldier most of all was the sight of three cardinals standing\r\namong the crowd at the door, \"just as the chaplains may be seen in any\r\nother house,\" and among them the cardinal of S. Pietro in Vincula\r\n(afterwards Julius II.), \"who dares contend with the Pope, and who yet\r\nstood here in the humblest and most respectful fashion.\" Before the\r\nmarquis left, the king made him a present of two valuable bay horses,\r\nremarkable for their fine shape and speed. One of the two was an\r\nexcellent jumper, and delighted Francesco by the way in which he could\r\nclear wide trenches and lofty fences at a single bound, \"jumping with\r\nall four feet in the air at once.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time Gonzaga's secretary, Jacopo d'Atri, informed the\r\nMarchesa that the priest Bernardino d'Urbino and a troop of Mantuan\r\nsingers had been sent that evening to amuse the king. Charles questioned\r\nthe chaplain closely about his master's wife, asking for an exact\r\ndescription of her person, height, and features, and being especially\r\nanxious to learn if Isabella at all resembled the Duchess Beatrice, and\r\nif, like that illustrious lady, she was as charming and gracious as she\r\nwas beautiful. Don Bernardino replied discreetly that the Marchesa was,\r\nto say the truth, even more beautiful than her sister, and surpassed all\r\nother ladies by her charm and brilliancy. This roused the king's\r\ncuriosity to the highest pitch, and he insisted on having a full and\r\nparticular account of Isabella's talents and accomplishments, as well as\r\nof the gowns she usually wore and the fashion of her clothes, and\r\nrejoiced to hear she was not very tall, since he himself was short of\r\nstature and admired small women. \"In short,\" adds the secretary, \"his\r\nMajesty appeared quite in love with my description of your Excellency,\r\nand if he meets you, will, I am sure, seek to kiss your cheek, not once,\r\nbut many times. And this being the case, I am glad to be able to tell\r\nyou that the King of France is less deformed than people say.\"[62]\r\n\r\nThe desired meeting, however, was never effected. Immediately peace was\r\nsigned, Charles VIII. left Vercelli, crossed the Alps with the remnants\r\nof his army, and reached Lyons on the 7th of November. Commines,\r\nmeanwhile, was sent on a further errand to Venice, where he vainly\r\nendeavoured to negotiate a treaty, but found the Signoria determined to\r\nmaintain the cause of Ferrante of Naples. The Venetians were not sorry\r\nto disband their army and see the French cross the Alps; but none the\r\nless their indignation was great at the Duke of Milan's breach of faith\r\nin concluding a separate peace, and sharp words passed between the\r\nambassadors of Spain and Naples and the Milanese envoy at Venice.\r\n\r\n\"The best thing, in my opinion,\" remarks the annalist Malipiero, \"would\r\nhave been for Contarini to give the Stradiots orders to cut to pieces\r\nboth Duke Lodovico and Ercole of Ferrara, who are the Signory's worst\r\nenemies. And the truth is, you should never take part in another's\r\nquarrel, or enter the country of a foreign ally, for in these matters no\r\none is to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Altar piece ascribed to Zenale with portraits of Lodovico\r\nSforza and Beatrice d'Este (Brera)\r\n\r\nD. Anderson.]\r\n\r\nMaximilian, on his part, was satisfied with Lodovico's excuses, and\r\nowned that the duke was right to make peace without delay. As for\r\nLodovico, it was with a deep sense of relief that he saw the departure\r\nof the last French troops. He invited the Duke of Ferrara, the\r\nMarquis of Mantua, and the Venetian Provveditori to Vigevano, and\r\nentertained them all magnificently. When, on his return from Venice,\r\nCommines in his turn visited Vigevano, the duke rode out to meet him\r\nwith charming courtesy, and bade the French ambassador welcome to his\r\nbeautiful country home. But when they came to business, it was another\r\nmatter. Commines heard from Genoa that the two ships, which the Duke of\r\nMilan was to send to Naples with the French fleet, had received orders\r\nnot to sail, and when he asked for an explanation, Lodovico told him\r\nthat he could put no trust or confidence in his master the king. At the\r\nend of three days the ambassador took his leave, and just as he was\r\nstarting on his journey, to his surprise the duke came up to him very\r\ncivilly, and said that, after all, he wished to keep on friendly terms\r\nwith his Most Christian Majesty, and had determined to send Messer\r\nGaleaz with the ships to Naples, and that before Commines reached Lyons\r\nhe should receive a letter to this effect. So Commines crossed the Alps\r\nwith a light heart, and all the way to Lyons he kept looking back, he\r\ntells us, in constant expectation of hearing the sound of horse's hoofs\r\nbehind him. But the duke's messenger did not overtake him, and the ships\r\nnever sailed from Genoa.\r\n\r\nThat year the festival of Christmas was celebrated with great joy and\r\nsplendour at the court of Milan. After the troubled times of the last\r\ntwelve months, after the dangers which had threatened the very existence\r\nof the State, and brought the noise of war to the gates of Vigevano,\r\npeace and tranquillity were once more restored, and another era of\r\nunclouded prosperity seemed about to dawn. Now that poor Giangaleazzo\r\nwas dead, and Louis of Orleans had once more crossed the Alps, there was\r\nno one to dispute Lodovico's title or to prevent his son from eventually\r\nsucceeding him on the throne. Once more he and Beatrice were free to\r\ndevote themselves to the encouragement of learning and poetry, of\r\npainting and architecture; to watch Bramante and Leonardo at work, or\r\nread Dante and Petrarch together.\r\n\r\nThat winter the altar-piece of the Brera, containing the portraits of\r\nthe duke and his family, was painted by Zenale or some other Lombard\r\nmaster, for the church of S. Ambrogio in Nemo. Here the Madonna and\r\nChild are enthroned in the centre of the picture; the four Fathers of\r\nthe Church, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory, stand on either\r\nside; and in the foreground, kneeling at the foot of the throne, are the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Milan, with their two children. The Christ-child\r\nturns towards Lodovico, and St. Ambrose, the protector and patron saint\r\nof Milan, lays his hand on the shoulder of the duke, as, clad in rich\r\nbrocades and wearing a massive gold chain round his neck, he clasps his\r\nhands in prayer. And the gentle Madonna stretches out her hand lovingly\r\ntowards Beatrice, who kneels at her feet, with the long coil of twisted\r\nhair, and the pearls on her head and neck, and her favourite knots of\r\nribbons fluttering from her shoulders or falling over the velvet stripes\r\nof her yellow satin robe. Close at her side is the infant prince,\r\nFrancesco Sforza, with his baby face and swaddled clothes; while\r\nopposite, kneeling at his father's side, is the handsome little Count of\r\nPavia. Here, at least, there is no doubt that we have authentic\r\nportraits of both Lodovico Sforza and Beatrice d'Este, the reigning Duke\r\nand Duchess of Milan, towards the close of the year 1495. There is no\r\nmistaking the long black hair, the refined features, and long nose of\r\nthe Moro, while in Beatrice's features we recognize the same youthful\r\nand child-like charm that mark her countenance in Cristoforo Romano's\r\nbust or Solari's effigy in the Certosa of Pavia.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit_., p. 627.\r\n\r\n[62] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 630.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nThe war of Pisa--Venice defends the liberties of Pisa against Florence\r\n--Lodovico invites Maximilian to enter Italy and succour the Pisans--The\r\nDuke and Duchess of Milan go to meet the emperor at Mals--Maximilian\r\ncrosses the Alps and comes to Vigevano--His interview with the Venetian\r\nenvoys--His expedition to Pisa.\r\n\r\n1496\r\n\r\n\r\n\"After Fornovo,\" wrote the Venetian Malipiero, \"Lodovico Duke of Milan\r\ngoverned all things in Italy.\" The departure of the French had left him\r\npractically the arbiter between the other Powers, and afforded him fresh\r\nopportunities of satisfying his ambitious schemes. He had long cherished\r\nhopes of recovering the city of Pisa, upon which the Dukes of Milan had\r\nancient claims, and in September, 1495, while Orleans still held Novara,\r\nhe sent Fracassa, at the head of a band of Genoese archers, to help the\r\nPisans defend their newly recovered liberties against the Florentines.\r\nThree months later Fracassa was recalled, in tardy compliance with the\r\ncondition of the Treaty of Vercelli; but early in the following year,\r\nthe Pisans, finding themselves deserted by the French, turned once more\r\nto Lodovico and implored his help. At the same time they sought\r\nassistance from the Signory of Venice, who, in March, 1496, publicly\r\ntook the city of Pisa under the protection of St. Mark, and helped their\r\nnew allies with liberal supplies of men and money. The Duke of Milan\r\nsent a small brigade to join these forces, and strongly encouraged the\r\nVenetians to bear the burden of a war from which in the end he hoped to\r\nreap solid advantage. But his secret jealousy of Venice, as well as\r\nrumours that Charles VIII. was meditating a second French expedition to\r\nrelieve the distressed garrison of Naples, induced him to seek the help\r\nof a new ally In the person of the Emperor Maximilian.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring he sent the Marchesino Stanga across the Alps to\r\ninvite Maximilian to come to the help of Pisa, which as an imperial city\r\nhad already appealed to him for protection, assuring him that his\r\npresence in Italy would maintain the balance of power between Venice and\r\nFlorence, and curb the French king's ambition. The prospect of\r\ndescending upon Italy and assuming the imperial crown flattered\r\nMaximilian's vanity, but, as usual, his movements were hampered by lack\r\nof money. At length he agreed to meet the Duke of Milan on the frontier\r\nof Tyrol and the Valtellina, and discuss their future plan of operations\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July the emperor left Innsbrück for Nauders, and on the\r\nsame day the duke and duchess, accompanied by Galeazzo di Sanseverino\r\nand the Count of Melzi, set out on their journey up the lake of Como to\r\nBormio, in the Valtellina, On the 17th they reached the Abbey of Mals,\r\n\"an ancient monastery,\" says Cagnola, \"at the foot of those terrible\r\nmountains on the way to Germany;\" and two days afterwards, received a\r\nmessage from Maximilian, informing the duke and duchess that he was\r\nabout to pay them a visit, but begging them not to leave their lodgings,\r\nas he wished the meeting to be informal and without ceremony. Early on\r\nthe morning of the 20th, the gay music of hunting-horns woke the\r\nmountain echoes, and a hunting-party suddenly appeared at the gates of\r\nthe old Benedictine abbey. First came a hundred soldiers on foot,\r\nbearing long lances, then fifty German lords in hunting-garb, with\r\nfalcons on their wrists. These were followed by his Imperial Majesty, a\r\nprincely figure in his simple grey cloth tunic and black velvet cap,\r\nwith a lion's skin hanging over his thighs, and the badge of the Golden\r\nFleece on his breast. A troop of servants and pages, in the imperial\r\nliveries of red, white, and yellow, brought up the rear of the\r\nprocession, that wound along the steep mountain-side and halted before\r\nthe convent, where the Duke of Milan had his lodgings.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian ambassador, Francesco Foscari, hearing of Maximilian's\r\nproposed visit, had, on Lodovico's invitation, followed him across the\r\nAlps, accompanied by the Cardinal of Santa Croce, the papal nuncio.\r\nBoth these envoys waited on the emperor at Mals, and that evening\r\nFoscari's secretary, Conrade Vimerca, wrote the following account of the\r\nmeeting between Maximilian and the duke and duchess in his despatches to\r\nVenice:--\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty alighted with an eagerness which seemed to me only too\r\ngreat, and went upstairs, where he found the duke alone with the\r\nduchess, and spent half an hour in close and affectionate intercourse\r\nwith them both. Afterwards they all three attended mass in the\r\nneighbouring church, and his Majesty appeared, leading the duchess with\r\nhis right hand and the duke with his left, with such demonstrations of\r\nlove and familiarity as can hardly be described. All three then rode on\r\nhorseback to the emperor's lodgings at Colorno (Glurns), some eight\r\nmiles distant, where his Majesty entertained the duke and duchess and\r\nall their suite at dinner under a pavilion, which had been erected under\r\nthe trees. His Majesty insisted on both the duke and duchess washing\r\ntheir hands with him in the same bowl, and, sitting down between them at\r\ntable, himself helped first one, then the other, from the endless\r\nvariety of dishes spread out before them. All this he did with an ease\r\nand kindness beyond anything that I have ever seen in royal personages.\r\nEach time the duke spoke he took off his cap, and his Majesty did the\r\nsame. After dinner they remained for some while in pleasant\r\nconversation, and then rode all three together to another place called\r\nMals, one mile further off, his Majesty bearing all the expenses of the\r\nentertainment. To-morrow night they will remain together here, and there\r\nwill be some time for discussion. I am quite sure,\" adds the Venetian\r\nsecretary, \"after this that we shall see his Majesty in Italy next\r\nAugust, and this you may hold to be absolutely certain. As for the King\r\nof France, they do not even mention his name or think of him any more\r\nthan if he did not exist.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the Signoria of Venice had joined the Duke of Milan in inviting\r\nMaximilian to come to Italy, and had promised him their assistance, they\r\nwere secretly not a little alarmed at the prospect of another foreign\r\ninvasion, fearing, as one of their chroniclers observes, that the\r\nGermans might prove to be even greater barbarians than the French. In\r\nthe interview which Foscari had with the emperor at Mals, he endeavoured\r\npolitely to dissuade him from entering Italy with a German army; but,\r\nas his secretary remarked, it was too late, for the Duke of Milan willed\r\nthat he should come. Nor were the jealous Venetians altogether pleased\r\nto see the marks of friendship and confidence with which the German\r\nemperor honoured Lodovico and his wife. The familiarity with which\r\nMaximilian treated both the duke and duchess, and the evident pleasure\r\nwhich he took in their company, seemed little short of marvellous in the\r\neyes of both Foscari and his secretary.\r\n\r\nThe singular charm and intelligence of Beatrice made a deep impression\r\nupon Maximilian, who could not but contrast her brightness and\r\ncleverness with the dulness and ignorance of his own Milanese wife. And\r\nthe duke's polished manners and cultured tastes could not fail to exert\r\na powerful fascination upon a monarch whose genuine love of art and\r\nromance made him in his way as remarkable a type of the Renaissance as\r\nthe Moro himself. Even apart from political considerations, this meeting\r\nbetween the two princes, that summer-time in the mountains of Tyrol, was\r\nan event of deep interest, and we can only regret that no record of\r\nBeatrice's impressions on this occasion has been left us.\r\n\r\nA conference between the emperor, the Duke of Milan, and the ambassadors\r\nwas held on the evening of that eventful day, and the details of the\r\nconvention between the allied powers was finally agreed upon. A new\r\nleague, which Henry the Seventh of England was afterwards invited to\r\njoin, was formed between the Emperor Maximilian, the Duke of Milan, the\r\nPope, the King of Spain, and the Venetian Republic; and Venice and Milan\r\npromised Maximilian a subsidy of 16,000 ducats if he would cross the\r\nAlps with an army, and compel the Florentines to give up Pisa and\r\nLeghorn.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the Venetian ambassador and the papal legate took\r\ntheir leave, and Maximilian accompanied the duke and duchess over the\r\nAlps to Bormio, where he joined in a chamois-hunt, and then rode back\r\nwith his retinue across the mountains to meet the empress at Tirano.\r\nLodovico and Beatrice travelled back to Milan, where they kept the feast\r\nof the \"glorious martyr St, Lawrence,\" on the 10th of August, with\r\nunwonted splendour, and then retired to Vigevano to prepare for the\r\nemperor's speedy return.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the month, Maximilian had once more crossed that\r\n\"_crudelissima montagna_\" of Braulio (Piz Umbrail), and was at Bellagio\r\non the Lake of Como, where Fracassa received him, and with five other\r\nMilanese knights held a _baldacchino_ over his head as he rode up to the\r\nMarchesino Stanga's Castle on the hills.\r\n\r\n\"But he only brought six secretaries and two hundred horsemen with him,\r\nand as before was simply clad in a suit of grey cloth,\" remarks a\r\nVenetian writer: \"the pettiest German baron would have come with more\r\npomp!\" A few days afterwards, the emperor went on to the ducal villa at\r\nMeda, near Como, where Lodovico met him with the Cardinal di Santa Croce\r\nand Foscari, and conducted him, on the 2nd of September, to see Duchess\r\nBeatrice at Vigevano. Here he remained for the next three weeks,\r\nenjoying the beauties of the Moro's favourite summer palace, and\r\nadmiring the perfection of Lodovico's latest improvements--the clock\r\nrecently constructed by Bramante, the marble capitals of the great hall,\r\nand the model farm and stables of the Sforzesca. Maximilian had\r\noriginally intended to visit Milan, and the erection of a triumphal arch\r\nin the Roman style had been ordered by the duke, together with other\r\ndecorations on a vast scale; but at the last moment this idea was\r\nabandoned. The Venetian, Marino Sanuto, unkindly suggests that the Moro\r\nwould not allow the emperor to come to Milan, lest he should see Duchess\r\nIsabella's son, who was the rightful heir to the crown. In all\r\nprobability the true reason lay in Maximilian's dislike of\r\nstate-pageants, and his preference for the freedom and country pleasures\r\nof Vigevano. As he told the Venetian ambassador, he preferred to travel\r\nabout in different places and enjoy himself in his own way. And His\r\nMajesty added, with a frankness by no means agreeable to Foscari and his\r\ngovernment, that he had no need of his company, and he preferred to be\r\nalone, since Duke Lodovico, with whom he was very intimate, could tell\r\nhim all that he wished to know. With which distinctly unpalatable piece\r\nof information the ambassador had to be content. Maximilian, he was\r\ncompelled to acknowledge, had come to Italy as the sworn friend and ally\r\nof the Duke of Milan, and the Republic must stoop to take the second\r\nplace in the councils of the League.\r\n\r\nIf Beatrice's charms had captivated the wise emperor at their first\r\nmeeting in the mountains of the Valtellina, he found her a thousand\r\ntimes more fascinating at her beautiful country home, with her children\r\nin her arms. He took great interest in both her little boys, and begged\r\nthat the elder of the two, Ercole, should bear the name of Maximilian,\r\nby which he became known in future days. In memory of this visit the\r\nemperor's portrait was introduced in the beautiful miniatures which\r\nillustrate Maximilian Sforza's Book of Prayers, or Libro di Gesù, still\r\npreserved in the Trivulzian Library. Here the young count is represented\r\non horseback, receiving his illustrious cousin, while the words of the\r\nLatin oration, which he is in the act of reciting, are illuminated on\r\nthe front page.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian Signory had decided to send two special ambassadors to\r\ncongratulate the emperor on his arrival in Italy, and on the 14th these\r\nenvoys, Antonio Grimani and Marco Morosini, reached Milan, where they\r\nwere received by Galeazzo Sforza, Count of Melzi, and lodged in the\r\nPalazzo del Verme, then inhabited by Madonna Cecilia Gallerani and her\r\nhusband Count Lodovico Bergamini, and lately decorated with frescoes and\r\nmarbles at the duke's expense. Early the next day they travelled by boat\r\nto Abbiategrasso, past the fair villas and smiling gardens that charmed\r\nthe eyes of Jean d'Auton when he travelled along the banks of the\r\nTicino. Here Foscari, who was already in attendance on the emperor, came\r\nto meet them, and they rode into Vigevano, where they were received by\r\nthe Count of Caiazzo and Galeotto della Mirandola, and listened in\r\ntorrents of rain to a Latin oration that was delivered in Maximilian's\r\nname. It was already dark when the ambassadors reached the Castello, but\r\nthe duke himself rode out to welcome them, and conducted them to their\r\nlodgings in the palace of his son-in-law, Galeazzo di Sanseverino. Here\r\nthe duke's own daughter, Madonna Bianca, the youthful bride whom Messer\r\nGaleaz had brought home a few weeks before, entertained her father's\r\nguests, and bade them welcome in the name of her gallant husband, who\r\nwas laid up with an attack of fever, and was unable to leave his room\r\nor attend to business. The next day the ambassadors were granted an\r\naudience, at which Marino Sanuto, as a member of Foscari's suite, was\r\nhimself present. His Majesty, whom the Venetian described as a\r\nmagnificent-looking man of thirty-seven, with long hair already turning\r\nwhite, and perfect manners, received them at the top of the grand\r\nstaircase, on the first floor of the Castello. As usual, he was clad in\r\nblack and wore a long velvet mantle, and a black woollen cap trimmed\r\nwith cords in the French style, having taken a vow to wear no colours\r\nuntil he had defeated the Turks, while his sole ornament was a gold\r\nchain, with the badge of the Golden Fleece, which hung round his neck.\r\nHe was seated on a daïs, draped with cloth of gold, with the Duke of\r\nMilan on his right hand, and the Cardinal di Santa Croce on his left.\r\nThe ambassadors of Naples and Spain were also present, as well as the\r\nCount of Caiazzo, the Marchesino Stanga, Don Angelo de' Talenti, the\r\nBishops of Como and Piacenza, the secretary de' Negri, and other\r\nwell-known Milanese courtiers. Marco Morosini then pronounced an elegant\r\nharangue, which was praised by all present, and graciously accepted by\r\nthe emperor, who conversed affably with the envoys on general subjects.\r\nAfterwards Marino Sanuto was presented to the Duchess Beatrice, who, he\r\nremarks, \"never leaves her lord's side, although she is once more with\r\nchild,\"--and her two fine little boys, \"Ercole, whose name has been\r\nchanged by His Majesty's desire to Maximilian, and who is called Count\r\nof Pavia, and a second named Sforza.\" A succession of _fêtes_ and\r\nhunting-parties was given by the duke for the entertainment of his\r\nimperial guest during the next week, and ending with a \"_Caccia\r\nbellissima_\" to which the cardinal-legate, all the princes, ambassadors,\r\nand courtiers were invited. Two hundred riders took part in the hunt\r\nthat day, and \"I myself,\" adds the grave historian, \"was there and saw a\r\nhare caught by a leopard.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of September the emperor took leave of the Duchess Beatrice,\r\nwho presented him, as a parting gift, with a superb litter, made of\r\nwoven gold, richly adorned with fine needlework--\"the most beautiful\r\nthing which I have ever seen,\" writes Sanuto, \"and valued at a thousand\r\nducats.\" The duke accompanied his guest as far as Tortona, where he\r\nleft Maximilian to go on to Genoa, and thence by sea to Pisa.\r\n\r\n\"There are, people say, three reasons,\" remarked Marino Sanuto, \"why His\r\nImperial Majesty is such fast friends with the Duke of Milan. In the\r\nfirst place, he sees that Lodovico has great power and authority\r\nthroughout Italy. In the second, he hopes to get some money out of him.\r\nAnd in the third place, he looks on him as a useful ally against the\r\nKing of France.\"\r\n\r\nHappily for both the emperor and the Duke of Milan's peace of mind, the\r\nFrench king's military ardour had soon died away, and although Trivulzio\r\nwas sent to Asti, and Orleans would gladly have followed him, Charles\r\nthe Eighth spent his time in jousts and hunting-parties, and forgot his\r\nunhappy subjects in Southern Italy. Ferrante, assisted by a Venetian\r\nforce under Francesco Gonzaga, recovered one fortress after another. On\r\nthe 29th of July, Montpensier, after holding the fortified city of\r\nAtella during many months, was forced to capitulate with his five\r\nthousand men, and himself died of fever a few weeks later at Pozzuoli.\r\nMost of his troops shared the same fate, and few of that gallant army\r\nlived to return to France. Suddenly, in the midst of his victorious\r\ncareer, the young king Ferrante, who had a few months before obtained a\r\npapal dispensation to marry his father's youthful half-sister, Princess\r\nJoan, died of fever, brought on by the fatigues and hardships to which\r\nhe had exposed himself in the previous campaign. His death was deeply\r\nlamented alike by his subjects and his relatives at Milan and Mantua,\r\nwho retained a sincere affection for this brave and popular prince.\r\nFortunately, his uncle and successor Frederic, the fifth king who had\r\nreigned over Naples during the last three years, proved a wise and\r\ncapable monarch. By degrees he succeeded in capturing the few remaining\r\ncastles still held by the French, and once more restored peace to his\r\ndistracted kingdom. Such was the state of affairs that autumn, when the\r\nGerman emperor landed at Pisa on the 21st of October. The citizens\r\nreceived him with acclamations, and, pulling down the French king's\r\nstatue, as they had broken the lion of Florence in pieces two years\r\nbefore, placed the imperial eagle on the top of the column in the public\r\nsquare. But they were once more doomed to disappointment. Maximilian,\r\nfinding himself, as usual, ill supplied with both men and money, and\r\nbeing inadequately supported by his allies of Venice and Milan, was\r\nunable to prosecute the war against Florence with any vigour. He\r\nattempted to besiege Leghorn; but his fleet was scattered and many of\r\nhis ships were wrecked by a violent storm, after which he gave up the\r\nundertaking, saying that he could not fight against both God and man.\r\nOne day towards the end of November, he suddenly took his departure,\r\nand, leaving Pisa, returned by Sarzana to Pavia. The Venetians saw the\r\nfailure of this expedition and the fruitless result of their large\r\nexpenditure of men and money, with great dissatisfaction, and attributed\r\nmost of the blame to Duke Lodovico.\r\n\r\n\"Things go badly for the Signory at Pisa,\" wrote Malipiero, who was\r\nhimself on board the Venetian fleet that sailed with Maximilian against\r\nLeghorn, \"and the cause of this is Lodovico Duke of Milan.... His pride\r\nand arrogance are beyond description. He boasts that Pope Alexander is\r\nhis chaplain, the Emperor Maximilian his condottiere, the Signory of\r\nVenice his chamberlain, since they spend their money largely to attain\r\nhis ends, and the King of France his courier, who comes and goes at his\r\npleasure. Truly a fearful state of things!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Marino Sanuto remarked, \"The Duke of Milan is one of the wisest men\r\nin the world, but his success has rendered him very ungrateful to\r\nVenice, whose secret enemy he will always remain. He made a great\r\nmistake in allowing the Duke of Orleans to escape from Novara, and some\r\nday he will be punished for his bad faith. For he never keeps his\r\npromises, and when he says one thing, always does another. All men fear\r\nhim, because fortune is propitious to him in everything. But none the\r\nless, I believe that he will not continue long in prosperity, for God is\r\njust, and will punish him because he is a traitor and never keeps faith\r\nwith any one.\"\r\n\r\nThe Florentine Guicciardini moralized in much the same strain, saying\r\nthat Lodovico publicly vaunted himself to be the son of Fortune, \"little\r\nremembering the inconstancy of human fame,\" and flattered himself that\r\nhe would always be able to govern the affairs of Italy, \"with his\r\nindustrie to turn and winde the minds of every one. This fond\r\npersuasion he could not dissemble, neither in himself, nor in his\r\npeoples, in so much that Milan day and night was replenished with voices\r\nvaine and glorious, celebrating with verses Latine and vulgar and with\r\npublicke orations full of flatterie, the wonderfull wisedom of Lodowike\r\nSforce, on the which they made to depend the peace and warre of Italy,\r\nexalting his name even to the third heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days the bard of Pistoja proclaimed that there was one God in\r\nheaven and one Moro upon earth, and sang the praises of this great and\r\ndivine Duca, who alone could open and close the doors of the Temple of\r\nJanus and make peace or war in Italy, while Gaspare Visconti extolled\r\nthe talents and virtues of Duchess Beatrice as surpassing those of all\r\nthe most illustrious women of antiquity. Then Leonardo designed that\r\nfamous series of allegories in his sketch-book, in which Duke Lodovico\r\nis represented alternately as Fortune, driving the squalid figure of\r\nPoverty away with a golden wand, and throwing his ducal mantle over a\r\nhelpless youth who flies before the ugly hag; or as supreme Wisdom,\r\nwearing the spectacles which can pierce through all disguises, and\r\npronouncing sentence between Envy on the one hand and Justice on the\r\nother. Then Bramante painted those frescoes on the walls of the Castello\r\nof Milan, in which the Moro was seen crowned and seated on his throne,\r\nunder a stately portico, administering justice, with four councillors\r\nand two pages at his side, while the criminal trembled before him, and\r\nofficers of state held the scales and prepared to carry out the\r\nsentence. And then, too, somewhere else in the palace, an unknown\r\nLombard master painted that fresco of Italy as a fair queen, with the\r\nnames of the chief cities embroidered on her robes, and the Moro\r\nstanding at her side, brushing the dust off her skirts with the\r\n_scopetta_ or little broom, that favourite emblem which appears in so\r\nmany illuminated books of the day. On the wall below the painting, the\r\nfollowing motto was inscribed:--\r\n\r\n\"_Per Italia nettar d'ogni bruttura_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, my lord duke,\" the Florentine ambassador is reported to have\r\nsaid, when Lodovico graciously explained the meaning of the\r\nallegory--\"take care the negro who is so busy brushing Italy's skirts\r\ndoes not cover himself with dust in his turn!\" The courteous duke only\r\nsmiled at the jest, and shrugged his shoulders; but others overheard the\r\nremark and repeated it, much to the satisfaction of his foes in Florence\r\nand Venice.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the great and powerful Duke of Milan had reached the distant\r\ncliffs of Albion and the palace of Westminster, and that November\r\nLodovico received a letter from Henry VII. of England, rejoicing with\r\nhis new ally on the conclusion of the League against France, and the\r\nvisit of the emperor to Italy. The king further informed him that \"the\r\ntreaty had been solemnly proclaimed by the Cardinal-Archbishop of\r\nConturberi, on the Feast of All Saints, in the cathedral church of the\r\nBlessed Apostle St. Paul, in our city of London.\" And our friend, Marino\r\nSanuto, proceeds to improve the occasion by informing us that \"this King\r\nEnrico has for wife Madonna Ysabeta, daughter of the late King Edward,\r\nbecause he defended the cause of Richard, brother of the said Edward.\r\nAnd he has two sons, Artur, prince of Squales, which is a neighbouring\r\nisland, and the Duke of Yorche.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nIsabella d'Este joins her husband in Naples--Works of Bramante and\r\nLeonardo in the Castello of Milan--The Cenacolo--Lodovico sends for\r\nPerugino--His passion for Lucrezia Crivelli--Grief of Beatrice--Death of\r\nBianca Sforza--The Emperor Maximilian at Pavia--The Duke and Duchess\r\nreturn to Milan--Last days and sudden death of Beatrice d'Este.\r\n\r\n1496\r\n\r\n\r\nThe records we have of Beatrice's private life during this busy year are\r\nvery meagre and disappointing. Scarcely one of her letters, belonging to\r\nthis period, has been preserved, while those which her sister Isabella\r\naddressed to Milan are almost as rare. The _marchesa's_ time and\r\nthoughts had been much engaged in public affairs during the absence of\r\nher husband with the Venetian forces at Naples, and she had little\r\nleisure for correspondence. On the 13th of July she gave birth to a\r\nsecond child, which, to her great disappointment, proved to be another\r\ngirl, who received the name of Margherita, but only lived a few weeks.\r\nOf this event the duchess was duly informed, and, in sending her\r\ncongratulations, was able to tell her sister that she was hoping to\r\nbecome the mother of a third child early in the following year. In\r\nSeptember the marquis fell dangerously ill of fever, and his wife\r\nhurried to join him in Calabria, and, as soon as he was able to move,\r\nbrought him back by slow stages to Mantua. During that summer, the only\r\nletter of interest which Isabella wrote to the Milanese court was a note\r\nto her friend, the jester Barone, begging him to find out for her how\r\nMesser Galeazzo and others who like him are the glass of fashion, manage\r\nto dye their hair black on certain occasions, and afterwards resume the\r\nnatural colour of their locks, adding that she remembers distinctly to\r\nhave seen Count Francesco Sforza with black locks one day, and the next\r\nwith brown.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November, Lodovico wrote an imperative note from Vigevano\r\nto the Castellan of the Rocchetta, Bernardino del Corte, desiring him to\r\nsee that the walls of the new rooms are dry and ready for habitation by\r\nthe end of the month, since the duchess must have the use of the\r\napartments adjoining the ball-room during her approaching confinement,\r\nand telling him to ask Bergonzio, the treasurer, for money, if more\r\nshould be required. Bernardino replied that the rooms were finished, and\r\nthat good fires had been lighted to dry the walls, and that the whole\r\nsuite would be furnished by the following week and ready to receive the\r\nduchess. He also informed the duke that the new rooms on the side of the\r\ngarden would be completed by Christmas, and told him that Bramante,\r\nafter finishing the arcades of the new gallery between the ball-room and\r\nRocchetta, had begun the design of the new tower. Both Leonardo and\r\nBramante were employed on extensive works in the Castello during the\r\nduke's absence that summer, although the Florentine master, we know, was\r\nchiefly engaged in finishing his great fresco in the refectory of the\r\nDominican convent outside the Porta Vercellina. Often during the summer\r\nheats, Matteo Bandello, then a young novice of the Order, saw the\r\nFlorentine master at noonday, \"when the sun was in the sign of the\r\nLion,\" leave the Corte Vecchia, where he was finishing his great horse,\r\nand, hurrying through the streets to the Grazie, mount the scaffold,\r\nbrush in hand, and put a few touches to some of the figures in the\r\nCenacolo, after which he would hurry away as quickly as he came. Often\r\ntoo the young friar watched him at his work; \"for this excellent\r\npainter,\" Matteo tells us, \"always liked to hear other people give their\r\nopinions freely on his pictures.\" Many a time the young Dominican saw\r\nMesser Leonardo ascend the scaffold in the early morning, and remain\r\nthere from sunrise till the hour of twilight, forgetting to eat and\r\ndrink, and painting all the while without a moment's pause. Sometimes\r\nagain he would not paint a single stroke for several days, but just\r\nstand before the picture during one or two hours, contemplating his\r\nwork, and considering and examining the different figures. And the\r\nfriars were very much annoyed because of the master's delays, and\r\ncomplained to the duke, who paid him so large a sum for the work, that\r\nhe had not yet begun the head of the traitor Judas. When the duke asked\r\nLeonardo why he left this head undone, he replied that during the last\r\nyear he had been vainly seeking in all the worst streets of Milan to\r\nfind a type of criminal who would suit the character of Judas, but that\r\nif desired he would introduce the prior's own likeness, which he thought\r\nwould answer the purpose excellently! This answer is said to have amused\r\nthe duke highly, and Lodovico and his painter had a good laugh together\r\nat the expense of the prior.\r\n\r\nBut since Leonardo was otherwise engaged, and another painter who had\r\nbeen employed in the Castello suddenly disappeared, owing, we are told,\r\nto some scandal in which he was concerned, the duke determined to send\r\nto Florence for another artist to complete the decorations of his new\r\nrooms. There was evidently no Lombard master whom he considered equal to\r\nthe task, and since Lorenzo de' Medici had sent him Leonardo, there\r\nmight be some other artists of rare excellence among his\r\nfellow-citizens. So Lodovico wrote to his envoy at Florence, and desired\r\nhim to let him have a full description of the best painters then living\r\nthere. In reply, he received the following list, which is still\r\npreserved in the archives of Milan, and which is of great interest, both\r\nas a monument of the Moro's untiring perseverance in seeking out the\r\nbest masters, and as a record of the different degrees of estimation in\r\nwhich living artists were held by their contemporaries:--\r\n\r\n\"Sandro de Botticelli--a most excellent master, both in panel and\r\nwall-painting. His figures have a manly air, and are admirable in\r\nconception and proportion.\r\n\r\n\"Filippino di Frati Filippo--an excellent disciple of the above-named,\r\nand a son of the rarest master of our times. His heads have a gentler\r\nand more suave air; but, we are inclined to think, less art.\r\n\r\n\"Il Perugino--a rare and singular artist, most excellent in\r\nwall-painting. His faces have an air of the most angelic sweetness.\r\n\r\n\"Domenico de Grillandaio--a good master in panels and a better one in\r\nwall-painting. His figures are good, and he is an industrious and active\r\nmaster, who produces much work.\r\n\r\n\"All of these masters have given proof of their excellence in the Chapel\r\nof Pope Sixtus, excepting Filippino, and also in the Spedaletto of the\r\nMagnifico Laurentio, and their merit is almost equal.\"[63]\r\n\r\nThis intimation seems to have decided Lodovico to apply to Perugino,\r\nwhom Leonardo had known as his fellow-pupil in Verrocchio's atelier at\r\nFlorence, and who was supposed to be in Venice at the time. So his\r\nsecretary wrote to desire Guido Arcimboldo, the Archbishop of Milan, who\r\nwas then in Venice, to inquire for the Umbrian master, and see if he\r\ncould be induced to visit Milan. The archbishop, writing on the 14th of\r\nJune, replied that Maestro Pietro of Perugia had left Venice six months\r\nago and was back at Florence. Lodovico, however, did not lose sight of\r\nthe master, and in the following October, by his desire, the monks of\r\nthe Certosa of Pavia engaged this popular artist to paint an altar-piece\r\nfor one of their chapels. In the following year the duke returned to the\r\ncharge, and hearing that Perugino had returned to his native city, wrote\r\ntwo pressing letters to one of the Baglioni, who was the chief\r\nmagistrate of Perugia, begging him, as a personal favour, to induce\r\nMesser Pietro to come to Milan, and offering to pay the artist whatever\r\nprice he may ask, and to retain him permanently in his service or keep\r\nhim only for a fixed time, as he may think best. Perugino, however, was\r\nthen engaged in decorating the Sala del Cambio in his native town, and\r\nhad already more commissions than he could execute. He declined the Duke\r\nof Milan's repeated invitations, and the Moro was obliged to fall back\r\nupon Bramante and Leonardo to finish the works in the Castello.\r\n\r\nBut although the duke's passion for building new churches and palaces or\r\nbeautifying those which he had already built, was as ardent as ever, it\r\nbecame more and more difficult to find the money to meet the vast\r\nexpenditure which his splendid schemes involved. The _fêtes_ in honour\r\nof Maximilian and the subsidies which had been granted for his\r\nexpedition had already entailed heavy expenses, and on every side the\r\nsame complaint was heard. There was no money to pay the salaries of the\r\nnumerous professors at Pavia and Milan, whose chairs had been founded\r\nby Lodovico himself; none to pay the bills for building and furnishing\r\nthe new rooms in the Castello, or to cast Leonardo's great horse in\r\nbronze. Everywhere people were groaning at the heavy burdens imposed\r\nupon them, and at Lodi, Cremona, and other places there had been not\r\nonly murmuring against the duke, but actual rioting and tumults, while\r\nin some parts of the duchy the inhabitants were leaving their homes to\r\nescape these harsh exactions. Lodovico's most faithful servants began to\r\nlook grave, and the duke himself could not but be aware of his growing\r\nunpopularity among his subjects.\r\n\r\nWhether these rumours reached the ears of Beatrice and disturbed her\r\nhappiness, we cannot tell; but we know that her life was saddened and\r\nthe gladness of her heart clouded by a new sorrow that autumn. The duke,\r\nwho for many years past had proved himself a devoted and affectionate\r\nhusband, and realized better than any one what an admirable companion\r\nand partner he had in his young wife, suddenly found a new object for\r\nhis affections in Lucrezia Crivelli, a beautiful and accomplished maiden\r\nof a noble Milanese family, who was one of the duchess's\r\nladies-in-waiting. Soon Lodovico's passion for this new mistress became\r\npublicly known, Leonardo was employed to paint her picture; and, under\r\nthe date of November, 1496, the annalist of Ferrara writes, \"The latest\r\nnews from Milan is that the duke spends his whole time and finds all his\r\npleasure in the company of a girl who is one of his wife's maidens. And\r\nhis conduct is ill regarded here.\" The chronicler Muralti, in his brief\r\nand touching account of the young duchess, after recalling Beatrice's\r\ncharms and joyous nature, tells us that, although Lodovico loved his\r\nwife intensely, he took Lucrezia Crivelli for his mistress, a thing\r\nwhich caused Beatrice the most bitter anguish of mind, but could not\r\nalter her love for him. And remorse for the pain which he had caused\r\nBeatrice gave the sharpest sting to Lodovico's own despair, on that sad\r\nday when he wept for his young wife's early death.\r\n\r\nThat autumn a fresh and unexpected blow fell upon the ducal family, in\r\nthe death of Lodovico's beloved daughter Bianca, the young wife of\r\nGaleazzo di Sanseverino, who died very suddenly at Vigevano, on the\r\n22nd of November. Both the duke and duchess had been fondly attached to\r\nthis fair young girl who only four or five months before had become the\r\nwife of Galeazzo, and was one of Beatrice's favourite companions. Her\r\nsudden and premature death threw a gloom over the whole court, and in\r\nelegant verse Niccolo da Correggio deplored the loss of the gentle\r\nmaiden who had gone in the flower of her youth to join the blessed\r\nspirits, and grieved for the gallant husband whom a cruel fate had so\r\nearly robbed of his bride. There can be little doubt that we have a\r\nportrait of this lamented princess in the beautiful picture of the\r\nAmbrosiana, which, long supposed to be the work of Leonardo, is now\r\nrecognized by the best critics as that of Ambrogio de Predis. At one\r\ntime this portrait was said to represent Beatrice herself, but neither\r\nthe long slender throat nor the delicate features bear the least\r\nresemblance to those of the duchess, while the style of head-dress is\r\nequally unlike that which Beatrice wears in authentic representations.\r\nAgain, some critics have supposed the Ambrosian picture to represent\r\nKaiser Maximilian's wife, Bianca Maria Sforza; but the discovery of\r\nAmbrogio de Predis's actual portrait of the empress, and of his sketch\r\nof her head in the Venetian Academy, have shown this theory to be\r\nimpossible. The Venetian Marc Antonio Michieli, who saw this picture in\r\nTaddeo Contarini's house at Venice in 1525, describes it as \"a profile\r\nportrait of the head and bust of Madonna, daughter of Signor Lodovico of\r\nMilan,\" after which he adds, \"married to the Emperor Maximilian ... by\r\nthe hand of ... _Milanese_.\" The connoisseur had evidently confused the\r\ntwo Bianca Sforzas, but now that this mistake has been explained by a\r\ncomparison of the Ambrosian portrait with genuine pictures and medals of\r\nthe empress, there is no difficulty in accepting the remainder of his\r\nstatement. For we have here, there can be little doubt, the portrait of\r\nLodovico's daughter, by the hand of a Milanese painter, in all\r\nprobability, as Morelli divined, the court-painter of the ducal house,\r\nAmbrogio de Predis. And the German critic, Dr. Müller-Walde, is probably\r\nright in his conjecture that the companion picture in the Ambrosiana is\r\nthe portrait of Bianca's husband, Galeazzo di Sanseverino. This picture\r\nhas been called by many names, and ascribed to many different hands. It\r\nhas been described in turn as a portrait of Maximilian, of the\r\nshort-lived Duke Giangaleazzo, and of Lodovico Moro himself. But\r\nAmbrogio's portrait certainly represents none of the three, and it is\r\nfar more likely that we have here a likeness of the duke's son-in-law,\r\npainted about the time of his marriage to Bianca Sforza. This handsome\r\nman of thirty, in the fur-trimmed vest and red cap, with the dark eyes,\r\nlong locks, and refined thoughtful face, touched with an air of\r\nmelancholy, may well be the brilliant cavalier who played so great a\r\npart at the Moro's court, the patron of Leonardo and Luca Pacioli, and\r\nthe loyal servant of Duchess Beatrice.\r\n\r\nBoth the duke and his wife were overwhelmed with grief at Madonna\r\nBianca's death. Lodovico himself wrote to Isabella d'Este that the wound\r\nhad pierced his inmost heart, and the duchess and Messer Galeaz both\r\nexpressed their grief in touching words. On the 23rd of November,\r\nBeatrice wrote these few sad lines to her sister--\r\n\r\n\"Although you will have already heard from my husband the duke of the\r\npremature death of Madonna Bianca, his daughter and the wife of Messer\r\nGaleaz, none the less I must write these few lines with my own hand, to\r\ntell you how great is the trouble and distress which her death has\r\ncaused me. The loss indeed is greater than I can express, because of our\r\nclose relationship and of the place which she held in my heart. May God\r\nhave her soul in His keeping!\"[64]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galeazzo Di Sanseverino.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by Ambrogio de Predis.\r\n\r\n(Ambrosiana)\r\n\r\nD. Anderson.]\r\n\r\nAll the _fêtes_ which had been prepared in honour of the emperor's\r\nreturn to Lombardy were stopped, and the duke and duchess, with their\r\nlittle son, attended by a small suite of courtiers and ladies, in deep\r\nmourning, travelled by water to Pavia, to receive their illustrious\r\nkinsman when he arrived from Sarzana on the 2nd of December. On this\r\noccasion Maximilian behaved with great consideration, and showed deep\r\nsympathy with his distressed relatives. Instead of making a public entry\r\nthrough the city, he rode up through the park to the private gate of the\r\nCastello, where the duke and duchess met him and conducted him to his\r\nrooms. Here he spent the evening alone in their company, and refused to\r\nsee any one but the little Count of Pavia, for whom he is said to have\r\ncherished great affection. The Venetian envoy, Francesco Foscari,\r\nhearing of the emperor's arrival, hastened to Pavia, and with difficulty\r\nobtained an audience from His Majesty, who told him that it was\r\nimpossible for him to visit Milan or remain any longer in Italy, since\r\nthe German Diet was about to meet, and he had promised to join his son,\r\nthe Archduke Philip, at Augsburg. A council was held in the Castello to\r\ndiscuss political affairs, but it was plain that the Pisans had nothing\r\nmore to expect from their imperial ally, and Maximilian was only anxious\r\nto be back in Germany. On the 4th he attended a solemn requiem mass for\r\nthe lamented princess Bianca in the Duomo, and in the afternoon rode out\r\nto the Certosa with Lodovico, who showed him all the wonders of that\r\nfamous church and abbey. On the 6th, the duke took his wife, whose\r\ndelicate state of health needed rest, back to Milan, and a few days\r\nlater returned with Foscari to meet the emperor at the ducal villa of\r\nCussago. On the 11th, Maximilian went to Groppello, where he knighted\r\nthe Venetian ambassador and dismissed him, after which he took leave of\r\nthe duke, says the chronicler, with many expressions of affection on\r\nboth sides, and once more set out on his journey across the terrible\r\nmountains. His expedition, remarked the Venetian writer, \"has effected\r\nnothing, and he leaves Italy in still greater confusion than he found\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nLodovico now joined his wife at Milan in time to receive another guest\r\nin the person of Chiara Gonzaga, the widowed Duchess of Montpensier, who\r\nwas on her way back from France. Since her husband's death at Pozzuoli,\r\nthis unfortunate lady had been vainly trying to recover her fortune from\r\nthe French king, and was full of gratitude to the duke for his friendly\r\nexertions on her behalf. Both her sons, Louis de Bourbon and Charles the\r\nfamous Connétable, were fighting with the remnants of the French army\r\nagainst her brother in Naples, and both were to lose their lives in the\r\nwars of Italy, while she herself spent the rest of her existence in\r\npoverty and seclusion at Mantua. But to the last she remained a loyal\r\nfriend to Lodovico, with whom she corresponded frequently. On the 22nd,\r\nChiara left Milan, and the celebration of the Christmas festival began.\r\nBut the courtiers and ladies-in-waiting noticed the strange and mournful\r\nforebodings which seemed to oppress their young duchess. They often saw\r\ntears in her eyes, and wondered whether they were caused by her\r\nhusband's neglect or grief for the loss of Bianca. Day after day she\r\npaid long visits to the Church of S. Maria delle Grazie, where the\r\nduke's daughter had been laid to rest in this his favourite shrine.\r\nThere in those last days of the year Beatrice might constantly be seen,\r\nspending hours in prayer at the tomb of the young princess, and musing\r\nsadly on the vanity of human joys. But no one dreamt how soon her own\r\nend was at hand.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 2nd of January, the Duchess Beatrice drove in her chariot\r\nthrough the park of the Castello and along the streets of the city to\r\nthe Porta Vercellina and the Church of S. Maria delle Grazie, where even\r\nthen Leonardo was at work upon his great fresco. In the eyes of the\r\npeople who saw her pass, she seemed in excellent health, and returned\r\ntheir loyal greetings with the same gracious charm. But when she reached\r\nthe Dominican church, and had paid her devotions at Our Lady's altar,\r\nand prayed for the repose of her daughter's soul, she lingered by the\r\nnew-made tomb, rapt in sorrowful thought, and it was long before her\r\nladies could persuade her to come away. After her return to the Castello\r\nthat afternoon, there was dancing in her rooms in the Rocchetta until\r\neight o'clock in the evening, when she was suddenly taken ill. Three\r\nhours later she gave birth to a still-born son, and half an hour after\r\nmidnight her spirit passed away.\r\n\r\nThat night, contemporary writers tell us, \"the sky above the Castello of\r\nMilan was all a-blaze with fiery flames, and the walls of the duchess's\r\nown garden fell with a sudden crash to the ground, although there was\r\nneither wind nor earthquake. And these things were held to be evil\r\nomens.\" \"And from that time,\" adds Marino Sanuto, \"the duke began to be\r\nsore troubled, and to suffer great woes, having up to that time lived\r\nvery happily.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice was gone, and with her all the joy and delight of the duke's\r\nlife had passed away. The court was turned from an earthly paradise into\r\nthe blackest hell, and ruin overtook the Moro and the whole realm of\r\nMilan, as the poet of the house of Este sang in his _Orlando Furioso_--\r\n\r\n\"Come ella poi lascerà il mondo,\r\nCosì degli infelici andrà nel fondo.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] Dr. Müller-Walde in _Jahrbuch d. pr.

There was sorrow and consternation among\r\nBeatrice's servants, and dismay upon the faces of secretaries and\r\ncourtiers who stood waiting for news in the halls and porticoes of\r\nBramante's building. The duke's grief was said to be terrible. For some\r\ntime he refused to see any one, and many days passed before even his\r\nchildren were admitted into their father's presence. But, with\r\ncharacteristic strength of mind, he sent for his secretaries that\r\nmorning, and himself dictated the letters which bore the sad news to\r\nBeatrice's family at Mantua and Ferrara. In that dark hour the passion\r\nof his love and sorrow breaks through conventional formalities, and\r\ngives a touch of pathos to the brief message which he sent to Francesco\r\nGonzaga--\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS RELATIVE AND DEAREST BROTHER,--\r\n\r\n\"My wife was taken with sudden pains at eight o'clock last night. At\r\neleven she gave birth to a dead son, and at half-past twelve she gave\r\nback her spirit to God. This cruel and premature end has filled me with\r\nbitter and indescribable anguish, so much so that I would rather have\r\ndied myself than lose the dearest and most precious thing that I had in\r\nthis world. But great and excessive as is my grief, beyond all measure,\r\nand grievous as your own will be, I know, I feel that I must tell you\r\nthis myself, because of the brotherly love between us. And I beg you not\r\nto send any one to condole with me, as that would only renew my sorrow.\r\nI would not write to the Madonna Marchesana, and leave you to break the\r\nnews to her as you think best, knowing well how inexpressible her sorrow\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\n                                   \"LODOVICUS M. SFORTIA,\r\n                                           _Anglus Dux Mediolani_.[65]\r\n\r\nMilan, January 3, 1497, 6 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nThe same day the duke sent the following intimation to the loyal\r\ncitizens of Pavia: \"Last night at half-past twelve our beloved wife,\r\nafter giving birth to a son who died at eleven, changed this life for\r\ndeath, which most cruel event snatches from us one who, by reason of her\r\nrare and singular virtues, was dearer to us than our own life. You will\r\nunderstand what our grief is and how difficult it is to bear this\r\nirreparable loss with patience and reason. We beg of you to pray God for\r\nthe soul of our dearest consort, and to hold solemn funeral services in\r\nthe Duomo and in all other churches of the city.\"[66]\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock that afternoon, the Ferrarese ambassador, Antonio\r\nCostabili, received an unexpected summons to the Castello, and he was\r\nadmitted into the duke's presence. We give the details of his interview\r\nwith the grief-stricken prince, in his own words from a letter which he\r\naddressed the same evening to Beatrice's father, Duke Ercole--\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCELLENT LORD,\r\n\r\n\"Although I had received a message to the effect that I need not leave\r\nthe house before night, as none of your august family could be present\r\nat the funeral of our most illustrious Madonna, the late duchess,\r\nnevertheless at four o'clock the duke sent two councillors to fetch me,\r\nand accompanied by these gentlemen, I went to the Camera della Torre in\r\nthe Castello, where I found all the ambassadors, ducal councillors, and\r\na very large company of gentlemen assembled. Directly I arrived, his\r\nExcellency sent for me, and I found him in his room, lying on the bed,\r\nquite prostrate, and more overwhelmed with grief than any one whom I\r\nhave ever seen. After the customary salutations, I endeavoured, in\r\nobedience to the request of some of his councillors, to exhort his\r\nHighness to take a little comfort and have patience, trying to make use\r\nof whatever words came into my mind at the moment, and entreating him to\r\nbear this cruel blow with constancy and fortitude, because in this\r\nmanner he would give comfort and courage to your Excellency in helping\r\nyou to bear your grief, and at the same time relieve the anxieties of\r\nhis own servants, and restore hope and peace to their hearts.\r\n\r\n\"His Highness thanked me for my kindness, and said that he could not\r\nbear this most cruel and grievous sorrow without speaking out the\r\nthoughts of his heart freely, and had sent for me, in order to tell me\r\nthat if, as he was conscious, he had not always behaved as well as he\r\nshould have done to your daughter, who deserved all good things, and who\r\nhad never done him any wrong whatsoever, he begged both your\r\nExcellency's pardon, and hers for whose sake his heart was now sorely\r\ntroubled. He went on to tell me that in every one of his prayers he had\r\nasked our Lord God to allow her to survive him, since he placed all his\r\ntrust and peace of mind in her. And, since this had not been the will of\r\nGod, he prayed, and would never cease praying, that if it were ever\r\npossible for a living man to see the dead, God would give him grace to\r\nsee her and speak to her once more, since he had loved her better than\r\nhimself. After many sobs and lamentations, he ended by begging me to\r\nassure your Highness that the love and affection which he bore you would\r\nnever be diminished in the smallest degree, and that he would retain the\r\nsame warm sentiments for you and for all your sons, as long as he lived,\r\nand would prove by his actions the depth and sincerity of his feelings.\r\nThen I took my leave, and he told me to go and follow the corpse, with a\r\nfresh outburst of sorrow, lamenting her in language so true and natural\r\nthat it would have moved the very stones to tears. Thus, still weeping,\r\nI returned to join the other ambassadors, who all approached and\r\nexpressed their grief and sympathy with your Excellency in very loving\r\nand compassionate words.\r\n\r\n\"The obsequies which followed were celebrated with all possible\r\nmagnificence and pomp. All the ambassadors at present in Milan, among\r\nwhom were one from the King of the Romans, two from the King of Spain,\r\nand others from all the powers of Italy, lifted the corpse and bore it\r\nto the first gate of the Castello. Here the privy councillors took the\r\nbody in their turn, and at the corners of the streets groups of\r\nmagistrates stood waiting to receive it. All the relatives of the ducal\r\nfamily wore long mourning cloaks that trailed on the ground, and hoods\r\nover their heads. I walked first with the Marchese Ermes, and the others\r\nfollowed, each in his right order. We bore her to Santa Maria delle\r\nGrazie, attended by an innumerable company of monks and nuns and\r\npriests, bearing crosses of gold, of silver and wood, infinite numbers\r\nof gentlemen and citizens, and crowds of people of every rank and class,\r\nall weeping and making the greatest lamentation that was ever seen, for\r\nthe great loss which this city has suffered in the death of its duchess.\r\nThere were so many wax torches it was marvellous to see! At the gates of\r\nSanta Maria delle Grazie, the ambassadors were waiting to receive the\r\nbody, and, taking it from the hands of the chief magistrates, they bore\r\nit to the steps of the high altar, where the most reverend\r\ncardinal-legate was seated, in his purple robes, between two bishops,\r\nand himself said the whole Office. And there the duchess was laid on a\r\nbier draped with cloth of gold, bearing the arms of the house of Sforza,\r\nand clad in one of her richest _camoras_ of gold brocade.\r\n\r\n\"My dear lord, besides the extraordinary demonstrations of grief which\r\nhave been shown by the whole people of this city, and by the women quite\r\nas much as by the men, which may well be a great consolation to your\r\nExcellency, I must tell you how above all others, Signore Messer\r\nGaleazzo di Sanseverino has both by his words and deeds, as well as by\r\nhis demonstrations of sorrow, given admirable expression to the\r\naffection which he had for the duchess, and has taken care to make known\r\nto every one the virtues and goodness of that most illustrious Madonna.\r\nAll of which I have felt it my duty to tell your Excellency, in the\r\nhope that it may help to alleviate your sorrow, praying you to maintain\r\nthe same fortitude that you have always shown hitherto.\r\n\r\n\"To whose favour I ever commend myself,\r\n\r\n                                   \"Your Excellency's servant,\r\n                                              ANTONIUS COSTABILIS.[67]\r\n\r\nMilan, January 3, 1497.\"\r\n\r\nSo, by the light of a thousand torches, at the close of the short\r\nwinter's day, the long procession of mourners bore Duchess Beatrice to\r\nher last resting-place under Bramante's cupola, in the church of Our\r\nLady. It was the duke's pleasure that his dearly loved wife should rest\r\nthere, before the altar where she had often worshipped, by the side of\r\nthe young daughter whom they had both loved so well. Only a year or two\r\nbefore, the people of Milan had seen her enter those doors in the bloom\r\nof her youthful beauty and the joy of her proud young motherhood to give\r\nthanks for the birth of her first-born son. But yesterday they had\r\nwatched her moving among them, full of life and charm; now they saw her\r\nlying there in her gorgeous brocades and jewelled necklace, with her\r\neyes closed in death and the dark locks curling over her marble brow.\r\n\r\nIt was a tragedy which might well melt the heart of the bravest man and\r\nmove the sternest to tears. No wonder that men like Galeazzo and the\r\nMarchesino, who had shared Beatrice's pleasures, and had seen her so\r\nlately foremost in the chase and gayest in dance and song, wept when\r\nthey saw her lying there cold and lifeless. As the chroniclers one and\r\nall tell us, \"Such grief had never been known before in Milan.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ferrara, the home of Beatrice's childhood, where she was loved both\r\nfor her own and for her mother's sake, the sorrow was scarcely less.\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday, the 4th of January,\" writes the diarist, \"came the news\r\nof the death of Beatrice, Duchess of Milan. And the duke was very sad,\r\nand so were all the people. And on the 12th, Duke Ercole attended an\r\nOffice said for the repose of the late duchess in the church of the\r\nDominicans, which was all hung with black, and all the clergy,\r\nmagistrates, and courtiers were there, carrying lighted torches; all the\r\npeople wore black, and the shops were closed as if it were Christmas,\r\nand more than 400 Masses were said for the repose of her soul, and 660\r\ncandles were burnt that day. It was a fine day, but a great quantity of\r\nwax tapers were used for this funeral service. As for the Duke of Milan,\r\nI will say nothing, because the things he does sound incredible to those\r\nwho have not seen them. Certainly the extraordinary honours which he\r\npays his dead wife show how dearly he loved her. She has left him two\r\nlittle sons. And all Ferrara sorrows for her death, and I saw many\r\nweeping. And so goes this ribald world.\"[68]\r\n\r\nThat year no races were held on St. George's Day, at Ferrara, and the\r\n_pallium_ usually given to the winner was presented by Duke Ercole to\r\nthe Franciscan Church.\r\n\r\nAt Mantua there was the same general lamentation, and the same funeral\r\nMasses were offered up for the young duchess, who had not yet completed\r\nher twenty-second year. Isabella's own sorrow was great.\r\n\r\n\"When I think,\" she wrote to her father, on the 5th of January, \"what a\r\nloving, honoured, and only sister I have lost, I am so much oppressed\r\nwith the burden of this sudden loss, that I know not how I can ever find\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the marquis, writing to Duke Lodovico, says that he had never seen\r\nhis wife so completely overwhelmed with grief; and that she who has\r\nalways shown herself full of strong and manly courage in adversity, is\r\nnow utterly broken down. On hearing this, Lodovico roused himself from\r\nthe torpor of his grief to try and comfort his sister-in-law, and sent\r\nher an affectionate letter by one of his secretaries, begging her to\r\nseek the consolation which he himself could not find, and telling her\r\nhow much he thought of her, even though his own grief and bitterness of\r\nsoul made it impossible for him to write with his own hand. From all\r\nsides letters of condolence flowed in. Elegies and Latin verses recalled\r\nthe charms and talents of Beatrice and lamented the hard fate which had\r\nsnatched her away in the flower of life. Among these poetical tributes,\r\nNiccolo da Correggio's sonnet on seeing a portrait of the late duchess\r\nis perhaps the best.\r\n\r\n\"Se a li occhi mostri quel che fosti viva\r\n   Morti lor, come te, nulla vedranno\r\n   Ma le parte invisibil tue staranno.\r\n   Po che del secol questa eta sia priva.\r\nLaude al pictor, ma più laude in che scriva\r\n   Quello a futuri che i presenti sanno,\r\n   Origin e stato e che al triseptimo anno\r\n   Morte spense ogni ben che in te fioriva.\r\nMa come excedo tua forma il pennello\r\n   Excederà le tue virtù le penne\r\n   E resterà imperfetto, e questo e quello.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet's complaint that the painter's art can never reproduce one-half\r\nof the dead lady's charms is literally true in this instance, and those\r\nof Beatrice's portraits which we possess do but scant justice to the\r\nbrightness and beauty which fascinated young and old among her\r\ncontemporaries. Two of the letters addressed to Lodovico on this\r\nmelancholy occasion are especially worthy of mention. One was a Latin\r\nepistle from the Emperor Maximilian, in which the writer expresses his\r\ncordial regard for the duke and his frank admiration for the lamented\r\nduchess whose delightful company he had so lately enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe letter bears the date of January 11, 1497, and was written from\r\nInnsbrück.\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE AND DEAREST OF KINSMEN AND FRIENDS,\r\n\r\n\"Having just heard of the sad calamity which has befallen you in the\r\ndeath of your illustrious wife, Beatrice, our most dear kinswoman, we\r\nare filled with grief both on account of our great affection for you and\r\nof all the gifts of person and mind which adorned that renowned\r\nprincess, and which now only adds to the heaviness of our mutual loss.\r\nNothing could grieve us more at this present moment than to find\r\nourselves thus suddenly deprived of a relative who was dear to us above\r\nall other princesses, and whose surpassing charms and virtues we had\r\nlately learnt to value as they deserved. But we are still more\r\ndistressed to think that you whom we love so well should lose in her,\r\nnot only a sweet wife, but a companion who in so remarkable a degree\r\nshared the burdens of your crown and lightened your cares and cheered\r\nyour labours by her society. As for her, although she was one of the few\r\nwomen worthy of perpetual regret and eternal remembrance, this premature\r\ndeath is no true cause of sorrow, and we take comfort in the thought\r\nthat, since we must all die, they are most blessed who die young and\r\nwho, having lived happily in their youth, escape the innumerable\r\ncalamities of this miserable world and the evils of a weary old age.\r\nYour most fortunate wife enjoyed all that makes life good; no gift of\r\nbody and mind, no advantage of beauty or birth, was denied her. She was\r\nin every respect worthy to be your wife and to reign over the most\r\nflourishing realm in Italy. She has left you the sweetest children to\r\nrecall the face of their lost mother, and to be alike the consolation of\r\nyour present sorrow and the staff of your declining years. And when the\r\ntime comes for you to go hence, you will be able to leave them a\r\npeaceful throne and the immortal memory of your name. May the\r\nrecollection of all the good that you owe her help you to share in these\r\nconsolations, so that, having already mourned your dear one's death more\r\nthan enough, your tears may at length be dried and she may rest more\r\nsafely, while we on our part are once more able to avail ourselves of\r\nyour help in these difficult and perilous times.\"[69]\r\n\r\nThe other letter was written to the duke on the 5th of January, from\r\nMantua, by Chiara Gonzaga, the widowed Duchess of Montpensier, who had\r\nso lately enjoyed the pleasure of Beatrice's company at Milan, and who\r\nnow poured out the fulness of her grief and sympathy with the bereaved\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"The piteous and lamentable news of your wife's sudden death, which, my\r\ndear lord, I have just received, has so bitterly revived my own sorrows,\r\nthat I am unable to write to your Excellency as I ought, or speak a\r\nsingle word of comfort, '_Chè medico morbeso mal sana li malatti_'--for\r\na sick doctor cures sick folks badly.--All I can do is to join my tears\r\nwith your own in lamenting this cruel and grievous misfortune and our\r\nmutual sorrow, which I only wish I could bear in your stead. Had\r\nfortune only better understood your need and mine, she would have left\r\nthat blessed soul to enjoy all the prosperity in store for her, and\r\nwould have allowed death to relieve me from the burden of my tearful and\r\nwretched existence. May that Divine Providence, Who orders all things\r\nfor some good end, give your Excellency comfort and lead this toilsome\r\nlife to a safe haven.\"[70]\r\n\r\nMaximilian's allusion to the duke's prolonged mourning for his wife\r\nagrees with the remarks of the Ferrarese and Venetian chroniclers. To\r\nthese men of the Renaissance, accustomed as they were to pass quickly\r\nfrom one phase of life to another and to witness swift and sudden\r\nchanges of fortune, this inconsolable grief seemed beyond understanding.\r\nFor a whole fortnight Lodovico remained in a darkened room, refusing to\r\nsee his children, and taking no pleasure even in their company. No\r\nambassadors were admitted into his presence; even Borso da Correggio,\r\nwho came from Ferrara, was referred to the Marchesino Stanga and the\r\nConte di Caiazzo, as deputies appointed by the duke to receive\r\ncondolences. And when Lodovico saw his ministers, they were strictly\r\ncharged only to speak of business matters, and never to mention the name\r\nof the duchess or allude to the duke's recent bereavement. So complete\r\nwas his seclusion and so profound his melancholy, that those about him\r\nbegan to tremble for his reason. \"The duke,\" wrote Sanuto, \"has ceased\r\nto care for his children or his state or anything on earth, and can\r\nhardly bear to live.\" But fears of his old enemy Louis of Orleans before\r\nlong roused him from the apathy and despair, and showed his foes that\r\nthey had still to reckon with him. Rumours of a French invasion were\r\nonce more heard; Trivulzio was at Asti with a strong force, and the Duke\r\nof Orleans was shortly expected to lead an expedition into Lombardy and\r\nassert his claim to Milan.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, Lodovico shaved his head, came out of his room,\r\nand publicly gave the standard and bâton of command to Galeazzo di\r\nSanseverino, who was sent to defend Alessandria at the head of a\r\nconsiderable Milanese and German army. But the French king's health was\r\nfailing, and the Duke of Orleans, who, since the death of the little\r\ndauphin twelve months before, had become the next heir to the crown,\r\nsuddenly refused to leave France. Trivulzio was repulsed in an attack\r\non Novi; while an attempt to seize Genoa, which was set on foot by the\r\nCardinal della Rovere and Battista Fregoso, was frustrated by the prompt\r\nmeasures of defence taken by the Duke of Milan and the Venetians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile every possible honour was paid to the memory of Duchess\r\nBeatrice. All through the duchy, during the month of January, solemn\r\nfuneral services were held, and one hundred requiem masses were said\r\ndaily in S. Maria delle Grazie for the repose of her soul, while a\r\nhundred tapers were kept burning day and night round the stone\r\nsarcophagus supported by lions in which her remains were interred. The\r\nduke himself, clad in a suit of black fustian and wrapt in a long black\r\ncloak, which all his courtiers wore as a badge of mourning, attended two\r\nor three masses daily, as well as many offices to Our Lady, and sent a\r\nhundred gold ducats to the Santa Casa at Loreto, in discharge of a vow\r\nwhich poor Beatrice had made to take a pilgrimage to that famous shrine\r\nafter the birth of her child.\r\n\r\nMarino Sanuto, writing in August, seven months after Beatrice's death,\r\nremarks that since his wife's death the duke has become an altered man.\r\n\"He is very religious, recites offices daily, observes fasts, and lives\r\nchastely and devoutly. His rooms are still hung with black, and he takes\r\nall his meals standing, and wears a long black cloak. He goes every day\r\nto visit the church where his wife is buried, and never leaves this\r\nundone, and much of his time is spent with the friars of the convent.\"\r\nAnd a Dominican historian, Padre Rovegnatino, then living, records how\r\nduring the whole of the next year Lodovico visited the convent regularly\r\ntwice a week--on Tuesday, which, being the day of the week on which\r\nBeatrice died, he always kept as a fast, and on Saturday, and on these\r\noccasions dined with the prior Giovanni da Tortona and his successor\r\nVincenzo Baldelli.\r\n\r\nThe decoration and improvement of this church and convent now became the\r\nchief object of Lodovico's thoughts. The beautiful shrine which he had\r\nalready adorned with Bramante's cupola and portico, was now doubly dear\r\nto him for the sake of Beatrice and his dead children. The annals of the\r\nconvent record the multitude of his benefactions to both church and\r\nconvent, and the cordial relations which he maintained with the\r\nDominican friars to the end of his reign. First of all, he applied\r\nhimself to raise a monument to the memory of Beatrice immediately in\r\nfront of the high altar, where her remains were buried. The sculptor\r\nwhom he chose for this work was Cristoforo Solari, called _Il Gobbo_, or\r\nthe hunchback, a surname which he had inherited from his father, who\r\nseems to have been deformed. The Solari were a race of sculptors, many\r\nof whom had been employed at the Certosa, while Cristoforo, who had\r\nsettled in Venice about 1490, was recalled to Milan about this time and\r\nappointed ducal sculptor, on the recommendation of the Marchesino\r\nStanga. It was the duke's pleasure that a recumbent effigy of Beatrice,\r\nwearing the rich brocades and jewels in which she had been borne to her\r\nrest, should be placed on her tomb, so that future ages should have a\r\nperpetual memorial of the young duchess as she had last appeared in the\r\neyes of the servants and people who had loved her so well. And as it was\r\nLodovico's own wish to be buried in the same tomb, the sculptor was to\r\ncarve an effigy of himself in ducal crown and mantle, lying at his\r\nwife's side in the last slumber. So, at the duke's bidding, the Milanese\r\nambassador, Battista Sfondrati, bought the finest blocks of Carrara\r\nmarble that he could find in Venice, and the brothers of the Certosa\r\nsent seven loads more from their vast stores to Solari's house in Milan.\r\nOut of these marbles the sculptor carved a noble bas-relief of the Dead\r\nChrist and the two admirable effigies of the duke and duchess, which now\r\nadorn the Certosa of Pavia. His task was probably finished before the\r\nclose of the following year, and the tomb was set up in the _Cappella\r\nmaggiore_ of S. Maria delle Grazie, at a cost of upwards of 15,000\r\nducats. At the same time Lodovico placed a slab of black marble on the\r\nwalls of the same chapel, in memory of the dead child whose birth had\r\ncost his mother her life, with the following proud inscription:--\r\n\r\n\"Infelix partus: amisi ante vitam quam in\r\nLucem ederer; infelicior quod matri\r\nMoriens vitam ademi et parentem con\r\n-sorte sua orbavi in tam adverso fato.\r\nHoc solum mihi potest jocundium esse\r\nQuod divi parentes me, Ludovicus et\r\nBeatrix Mediolanenses duces genuere,\r\nM.C.C.C.C.LXXXXVII. Tertio Nonas Januarii.\"\r\n\r\nThe ill-fated child had died before he had ever seen the light of day,\r\nand, still more unfortunate in this, he had deprived his mother of life,\r\nand left his father widowed and alone; but this at least he could\r\nproudly say, \"Lodovico and Beatrice, Duke and Duchess of Milan, were my\r\nparents.\"\r\n\r\nThe walls of the chapel were decorated with rich marbles and gilding,\r\nand new altars were set up in honour of Saint Louis and Santa Beatrice,\r\nthe patron saints of the duke and duchess. Cristoforo was employed to\r\ncarve reliefs for the high altar, and the duke gave the friars a\r\njewelled crucifix and marvellously wrought set of chalices, patens,\r\ncandelabra, paci of _niello_, engraved with Beatrice's name and arms.\r\nAmong other costly gifts, he also presented them with a magnificent\r\n_pallium_ and richly embroidered hangings for the altar, and a set of\r\nilluminated choir-books with enamelled and jewelled bindings, while the\r\nMarchesino Stanga gave an organ to the church. Bramante was ordered to\r\ncomplete the cupola as soon as possible, and was employed later to add a\r\nnew sacristy to the church.\r\n\r\nBut there was one thing more which lay still nearer to Lodovico's heart.\r\nLeonardo's great wall-painting for the convent refectory was well-nigh\r\ncompleted. Cardinal Perault de Gurk, when he visited his friend the\r\nDominican prior towards the end of January, 1497, saw and admired the\r\nwork of Leonardo, and conversed with the painter, who laughed, Bandello\r\ntells us, at his Eminence's ignorance for thinking his salary of 2000\r\nducats a large one and expressing surprise at the duke's liberality.\r\nLodovico was now anxious to see the life-sized portraits of himself and\r\nBeatrice with their children painted by the great master's hand on the\r\nopposite wall. The Dominican historian, Padre Pino, writing in the last\r\ncentury, says that the convent retained a life-sized portrait of that\r\nmost excellent and famous lady, Duchess Beatrice, in which the sweet\r\ngentleness of her nature and majesty of her bearing were faithfully\r\nreproduced; and Padre Gattico, a very accurate and careful writer of the\r\nsixteenth century who wrote the history of the convent from its\r\nfoundation, describes how Leonardo da Vinci was employed by Lodovico to\r\npaint portraits of himself and Beatrice, with their children kneeling at\r\ntheir feet, on the wall opposite the Cenacolo, but adds that these\r\nportraits, being painted in oil, were already in a ruinous condition.\r\nThe Dominican father's words were all too true, and only the merest\r\nfragments of these portraits, which Vasari described as works of sublime\r\nbeauty, now remain on the wall, where the Lombard artist Montorfano had\r\nalready painted his fresco of the Crucifixion. That of Beatrice is a\r\nmere ghost, but enough remains of Lodovico's figure to show how nobly\r\nLeonardo treated his subject, and is of the deepest interest as an\r\nexample of the great Florentine's art and a faithful likeness of his\r\nillustrious patron. A distinct reference to Lodovico's wishes on the\r\nsubject may be found in the paper of directions which he drew up on the\r\n30th of June, 1497, for his minister the Marchesino Stanga.\r\n\r\n\"_Memorandum of the things which Messer Marchesino is to do._\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, he is to place the ducal arms in gold letters on a\r\nmarble slab on Porta Ludovica, together with ten bronze medals bearing\r\nthe duke's head.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to see that similar tablets are placed on all the public\r\nbuildings, excepting those in the Castello, which are in charge of\r\nMesser Bernardino di Corte, and that medals are placed between them.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to see that _El Gobbo_ carves the reliefs for the altar this\r\nyear, and that he has sufficient marble, and if more is needed, send to\r\nVenice or Carrara.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to see that the sepulchre is finished without delay, and to\r\ndesire _Gobbo_ to work at the covering and all the other portions\r\nbelonging to the tomb, so that it may be ready as soon as the rest of\r\nthe sepulchre.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to ask Leonardo the Florentine to finish his work on the wall\r\nof the Refectory, and to begin the painting on the other wall of the\r\nRefectory. If he will do this, some arrangement may be made with him\r\nregarding the agreements signed by his own hand, by which he stipulated\r\nto finish the work within a certain time.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to see that the portico of S. Ambrogio is finished, for which\r\ntwo thousand ducats have been assigned.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to call together all the most skilled architects to hold a\r\nconsultation, and design a model for the façade of Santa Maria delle\r\nGrazie, which shall be of the same height and proportions as the\r\n_Capella Grande_.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to finish the _Strada da Corte_, which the duke wishes to see\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to make a head of our Madonna the late duchess, and place it on\r\na medallion with that of the duke on the doors of the chapel in Santa\r\nMaria delle Grazie.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to open a new gate in the walls corresponding to the Porta S.\r\nMarco, and call it the Porta Beatrice, and place the ducal arms and\r\nletters of the said duchess upon the said gate, as has been done at\r\nPorta Ludovica.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to desire that the decorations of the Broletto Nuovo should be\r\nfinished by August.\r\n\r\n\"_Item_: to place an inscription in gold letters on black marble above\r\nthe portraits of the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nThis _Memoriale_ was signed by the ducal secretary, Bartolommeo Calco,\r\nand the following lines were added by Lodovico himself:--\r\n\r\n\"MARCHESINO,--We have charged you with the execution of the works here\r\nmentioned, and, although you have already received our orders by word of\r\nmouth, we have for our further satisfaction set them down in writing, to\r\nshow you how extraordinary is the interest that we take in their\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\n\"LUDOVICO MARIA SFORTIA.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThe bronze medals here mentioned, which by Lodovico's orders were to be\r\nplaced on all the chief public buildings, were probably those designed\r\nby Caradosso after Beatrice's death, in which the head of the duke and\r\nduchess appear side by side.\r\n\r\nThe name and arms of Beatrice were to be seen everywhere; her portrait\r\nwas to be placed in the church of the Grazie, and her medallion above\r\nthe gate. And to-day, in spite of the common ruin which has overwhelmed\r\nthe palaces and churches of Lodovico's fair duchy, the armorial bearings\r\nof his consort may still be seen painted in the lunette above the\r\nCenacolo, as if the duke wished Leonardo's great painting to be\r\nespecially associated with her beloved memory; while not only in the\r\nCastello of Milan, but on the site of ducal castles and villas\r\nthroughout the Milanese, blocks of stone and marble carved with the\r\ninitials of Lodovico and Beatrice are constantly brought to light.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these tokens of grief and love for his lost wife, we\r\ncome upon a strange incident. That May, Lucrezia Crivelli, the mistress\r\nwhose _liaison_ with the duke had caused Beatrice the sorrow which he\r\nnow remembered with so much remorse, bore Lodovico a son, who was named\r\nGianpaolo, and who became a valiant soldier and loyal subject of his\r\nhalf-brother Duke Francesco Sforza in after days. The Moro, as far as we\r\nknow, never renewed his connection with Lucrezia after his wife's death.\r\nThe universal testimony of his contemporaries--\"he lived chastely and\r\ndevoutly, and was a changed man\"--seems to bear witness to the contrary;\r\nbut in the following August he settled Cussago and Saronno, the lands\r\nwhich three years before he had given to Beatrice, upon his mistress as\r\na provision for the son she had borne him, and in the act of donation\r\nspeaks expressly of the delight which he had found in her gentle and\r\nexcellent company.\r\n\r\nEven more strange it sounds in our ears to find Isabella d'Este, only a\r\nyear after Beatrice's death, writing to the duke's former mistress,\r\nCecilia Gallerani, to ask for the loan of her portrait by Leonardo's\r\nhand, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The fact that a\r\nprincess of the proud house of Este, and one who, in the eyes of her\r\ngeneration, was the model of all virtues, should seek a favour from one\r\nwho had wronged her sister so deeply, affords fresh proof how lightly\r\nsuch _liaisons_ were regarded in those days, and may incline us to be\r\nmore lenient in our judgments of the men and women of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[65] Luzio-Renier, _op. cit._, p. 639.\r\n\r\n[66] C.

In September the marquis and\r\nMesser Galeazzo met at a tournament held at Brescia in honour of the\r\nQueen of Cyprus. Fracassa was also present with his wife, Margherita\r\nPia, in a chariot driven by twelve fine horses, and both he and the\r\nmarquis entered the lists with their followers, but the hero of the day\r\nwas Galeazzo, who appeared suddenly at the head of forty horsemen, all\r\nin deep mourning, with hair dyed black, and black and gold armour, and a\r\nherald bearing a black pennon with gold griffins. When the joust was\r\nover, the queen entertained Fracassa's wife, and all the cavaliers, at\r\nsupper, and the next day Galeazzo escorted her home over the hills to\r\nAsolo. But this meeting did not improve the strained relations between\r\nthe princes of Milan and Mantua, and the secret intrigues which\r\nFrancesco Gonzaga carried on both with France and Florence soon came to\r\nLodovico's ears. In November the duke wrote a strong remonstrance to\r\nIsabella, complaining bitterly of her husband's ingratitude, and\r\ndeclaring that he would have exposed his fraudulent conduct in the eyes\r\nof the Venetians, and of all Italy, had it not been for the love and\r\nregard which he had for her. Isabella was seriously alarmed at the tone\r\nof her brother-in-law's letter, and did her best to effect a\r\nreconciliation between him and her husband. Her efforts were seconded by\r\nher father, Duke Ercole, and his sons, who were often at Milan, and kept\r\nup friendly relations with Lodovico after their sister's death. Alfonso\r\nand his wife, Anna Sforza, were at the Castello in June, and Galeazzo di\r\nSanseverino himself accompanied the heir of Ferrara to the shop of the\r\nfamous Missaglia to order a suit of armour which should be \"of a\r\ngallantry and perfection worthy of Don Alfonso.\" We hear of a splendid\r\nsuit of gilded armour, also the work of the Missaglias, being presented\r\nto Ferrante d'Este by the Duke of Milan, while Beatrice's youngest\r\nbrother, the boy-cardinal, Ippolito, succeeded Guido Arcimboldo as\r\nArchbishop of Milan, and took up his abode in that city. But a new\r\ncalamity befell the house of Este that November in the death of Anna\r\nSforza, who, like her sister-in-law, gave birth to a still-born child on\r\nthe 30th of November, and herself expired a few hours later, to the\r\ngrief of her whole family, and more especially of Duke Ercole, who, in\r\nhis advancing years, saw himself bereaved of all of those he loved best.\r\nThe sweetness and goodness of this princess, the Ferrarese diarist tells\r\nus, had endeared her to all the people of Ferrara, and in the shock of\r\nher sudden death Lodovico felt a renewal of his own sorrow. In the same\r\nweek, another Este princess, who had been closely associated with the\r\nMilanese court, also passed away. This was the widowed mother of Niccolo\r\nda Correggio, that once beautiful and charming Beatrice, who had been\r\nknown in her youth as the Queen of Festivals, and who for many years had\r\nbeen a staunch friend of the Moro, and had long occupied rooms in the\r\nCastello. After her death, Niccolo, feeling that the last link which\r\nbound him to Lodovico's court was severed, left Milan, and returned to\r\nhis old home at Ferrara. That autumn, Cristoforo Romano also left the\r\ncourt, which Duchess Beatrice's death had shorn of its old brightness\r\nand splendour, and entered the service of her sister Isabella d'Este at\r\nMantua, while the court-poet, Gaspare Visconti, died early in the\r\nfollowing year. One by one artists and singers were dropping out of\r\nsight, and the brilliant company which Lodovico's wife had gathered\r\nround her was fast melting away. The gay days of Vigevano and Cussago\r\nwere over, the deer and wild boars grazed unharmed in these woodland\r\nvalleys, and when Kaiser Maximilian asked the duke for one of his famous\r\nbreed of falcons, Lodovico sent him one belonging to Messer Galeazzo's\r\nbreed, saying that he no longer kept any of his own, and had quite given\r\nup hunting since the death of the duchess of blessed memory.\r\n\r\nBut his love of art and learning was as great as ever, and Fra Luca\r\nPacioli, the able mathematician, who came to Milan in 1496, and\r\ndedicated his treatise of _La Divina Proporzione_ to Lodovico, describes\r\nthe laudable and scientific duel of famous and learned men, that was\r\nheld on the 9th of February, 1498, in the Castello of Milan--\"that\r\ninvincible fortress of the glorious city which is a residence worthy of\r\nHis Excellency.\" The duke himself presided at this meeting, which some\r\nwriters have supposed to be a sitting of an academy of arts and sciences\r\nfounded by Lodovico, with Leonardo for its president, and left Milan the\r\nnext day, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Mount of the Madonna at Varese.\r\nAmong the many illustrious personages, religious and secular, who were\r\npresent on this occasion, Fra Luca mentions \"Messer Galeazzo Sforza di\r\nSan Severino, my own special patron,\" to whom he presented the beautiful\r\nilluminated copy of his treatise, now in the Ambrosiana, the Prior of\r\nthe convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the doctors and astrologers,\r\nAmbrogio da Rosate, Pirovano, Cusani and Marliani, and many well-known\r\njurists, councillors, architects, and engineers, including Leonardo da\r\nVinci, \"our fellow-citizen of Florence, who, in sculpture and painting\r\nalike, justifies his name and surpasses\"--i.e. _vince_ = conquers--\"all\r\nother masters.\"[72]\r\n\r\nLeonardo's Cenacolo, we learn from his friend Pacioli, was at length\r\nfinished, and preparations were being made for casting his great horse\r\nin bronze, but the master himself was chiefly engaged in the study of\r\nhydraulics, and was writing a treatise on motion and water-power. In\r\nApril, however, he was again painting in the Castello, and Messer\r\nGualtero, one of Lodovico's most trusted servants, informed the duke,\r\nwho was absent for a few days, that both his sons were very well, and\r\nthat Magistro Leonardo was at work in the Saletta Negra. He would\r\nshortly proceed to the Camera Grande in the tower, and promised to\r\ncomplete the decorations by September, in order that the duke might be\r\nable to enjoy them next autumn. A note in one of Leonardo's manuscripts\r\nspeaks of twenty-four Roman subjects, probably small decorative groups\r\nin _camaieu_, painted on the vaulting of these rooms, and gives the\r\nexact cost of the blue, gold, and enamel employed, but all trace of\r\nthese decorations has vanished. At the same time Lodovico appointed his\r\nfavourite master to the post of ducal engineer, and employed him to\r\nsurvey those vast and elaborate fortifications in the Castello, which\r\nexcited the wonder of the French invaders.\r\n\r\nTwo of Amadeo's great architectural works, the cupola of the Duomo of\r\nMilan, and the façade of the Certosa, were brought to a successful\r\nconclusion in these last years of Lodovico's rule, while the foundation\r\nstone of the noble Cistercian monastery attached to S. Ambrogio, now a\r\nmilitary hospital, was laid by the duke, and built at his expense from\r\nBramante's designs. The charitable society known as the Confraternity of\r\nthe Santa Corona, or Holy Crown of Thorns, a name familiar to all who\r\nhave visited its ancient halls, and seen Luini's fresco, was another\r\nexcellent institution intended for the relief of the sick poor in their\r\nown homes, which was founded under the duke's auspices, and largely\r\nsupported by his liberality. But once more wars and rumours of war came\r\nto disturb the Milanese, and to call Lodovico away from these public\r\nworks and improvements in which he took delight.\r\n\r\nThe renewed intrigues of Charles VIII. with the Florentines, and revived\r\nfears of a French invasion, induced Lodovico to send Baldassare Pusterla\r\nto Venice in February, 1498, to solicit the help of the Signoria, but\r\nwhile these negotiations were going on, a courier arrived from Ferrara\r\nwith the news of the French king's sudden death. Charles, who was not\r\ntwenty-eight, had died of apoplexy as he was watching a game of bowls at\r\nAmboise, and his cousin, the Duke of Orleans, had been proclaimed king\r\nunder the title of Louis XII. Sanuto reports that the courier who\r\nbrought the news from Amboise to Florence had ridden the whole way in\r\nseven days, and had killed no less than thirteen horses!\r\n\r\n\"Magnificent ambassador!\" said the Doge to the Milanese envoy, \"you told\r\nus that His Most Christian Majesty was on his way to Italy. We hear that\r\nhe is dead!\"\r\n\r\nThe news was a great relief to most of the Italian powers, to none more\r\nso than Lodovico, who saw his immediate fears removed, and did not\r\nrealize how much reason he had to dread the ambitious designs of his old\r\nrival king Louis. But in his eagerness to secure the alliance of\r\nFlorence, he committed the fatal mistake of affronting the Venetians. He\r\nrefused to allow a fresh detachment of troops, which they were sending\r\nto Pisa, to pass through his dominions, and the Signory in revenge sent\r\nan embassy to the King of France with secret orders to take counsel with\r\nTrivulzio and negotiate a league with Louis XII. against the Duke of\r\nMilan. All Lodovico's hopes were now fixed on the formation of a new\r\nleague between Maximilian, the Pope, Naples, and Milan. When this was\r\nconcluded, he offered the generalship of the allied forces, with the\r\ntitle of Captain of the King of the Romans, to the Marquis of Mantua.\r\nStill Francesco Gonzaga was not satisfied, and complained that he ought\r\nalso to be entitled Captain-general to the Duke of Milan, a title which\r\nLodovico refused to take from his son-in-law Galeazzo. However,\r\nIsabella, who had already paved the way for this reconciliation,\r\nimplored her husband to be content for the present with the duke's\r\noffer, remarking that the salary was the important thing, and in May the\r\nmarquis went to Milan, where he received a cordial welcome, and the\r\nterms of the agreement were satisfactorily arranged.\r\n\r\nLodovico now announced his intention of coming to Mantua in person, and\r\non the 27th of June arrived there on a visit to the marquis and\r\nmarchioness, accompanied by the young Cardinal Ippolito and the German,\r\nSpanish, Florentine, and Neapolitan ambassadors, with a suite of a\r\nthousand persons. Great was Isabella's anxiety that nothing should be\r\nlacking on this occasion, and endless were the pains which she took to\r\ndo honour to her splendid brother-in-law. She borrowed plate and\r\ntapestries from Niccolo da Correggio, and desired her own envoy at\r\nMilan, Benedetto Capilupi, to ask Galeazzo Visconti and Antonio\r\nCostabili what wines the duke preferred and what clothes he would expect\r\nher to wear. Lodovico himself had not yet laid aside his mourning, and\r\nIsabella wondered if the rooms of his apartments at Mantua must be hung\r\nwith black velvet, or if she might venture to relieve them with violet\r\ntints, as would, she felt, be more fitting to this festive occasion. The\r\nduke, Capilupi replied, would be satisfied with any arrangements the\r\nmarchesa liked to make, and as for the wines, he found that those\r\nusually preferred by his Excellency at supper were clear white wines,\r\nrather sweet and new, while at dinner he generally drank light red wine,\r\nsuch as Cesolo, all very clear and new.\r\n\r\nThe visit passed off successfully, and after three days of _fêtes_ and\r\nentertainments Lodovico returned to Milan. Francesco Gonzaga, however,\r\nstill wavered between the duke and the Venetians, and it was not till\r\nLodovico sent Marchesino Stanga and Fracassa to Mantua in November, that\r\nthe agreement was finally concluded, and Erasmo Brasca delivered the\r\nbâton to the marquis in the emperor's name. Isabella herself interviewed\r\nthe ceremony from a tribunal erected on the piazza in front of the\r\nCastello di Corte at Mantua, and the duke wrote a graceful note to his\r\nsister-in-law, thanking her for her good offices in the matter. He still\r\nconstantly sent her presents of choice fruits or wines and venison,\r\nwhile Isabella, in return, sent him salmon-trout from Garda, and\r\nEvangelista, the marquis's famous trainer, tamed the duke's horses. In\r\nJuly Lodovico sent her a basket of peaches, wishing they had been even\r\nfiner than they were, to be more worthy of her acceptance, and Isabella\r\nwrote in reply: \"The peaches sent by your Excellency are most welcome,\r\nnot only because they are the first ripe ones I have tasted this summer,\r\nbut far more because they are a proof of your gracious remembrance, for\r\nwhich I can never thank your Excellency enough.\" On New Year's Day,\r\n1499, Lodovico sent the marchioness two barrels of wine--\"_vino\r\namabile_\"--and two chests of lemons, and in February wrote to thank her\r\nfor the fish, which were very fine and good and had reached him\r\nopportunely, as it was Friday in Lent.\r\n\r\nGifts of artichokes, which were then esteemed a great delicacy, were\r\noften sent to the duke by Genoese nobles, and in March, 1499, we find\r\nGiovanni Adorno, the brother-in-law of the San Severini, who evidently\r\nknew Lodovico's taste for flowers, sending a basket of forty artichokes\r\ntogether with a bouquet of the finest roses. Another characteristic note\r\nwas the following, written by the Moro to Francesco Gonzaga, in\r\nJanuary:--\r\n\r\n\"I always take great delight in seeing the swans which you sent us some\r\nyears ago, sailing on the castle moat under these windows. So if you\r\nhave any others to spare, I beg you to send me some, for which I shall\r\nbe very grateful.\"[73]\r\n\r\nTwo of the last letters, which Isabella addressed to her brother-in-law,\r\nare of especial interest, as relating to Giangaleazzo's widow, the\r\nDuchess Isabella of Aragon. A few weeks after Beatrice's death, this\r\nunfortunate lady had been desired by the duke to leave her rooms in the\r\nCastello, and take up her abode in the old palace near the Duomo. Some\r\ncontention arose respecting the boy Francesco Sforza, whom Lodovico\r\nwished to keep with his own sons in the Rocchetta, and who remained\r\nthere for a time, only visiting his mother once a week. \"You have taken\r\nmy son's crown away,\" said the duchess, indignantly, \"and now you would\r\ntake his mother too!\" Lodovico is said to have replied, \"Madam, you are\r\na woman, so I will not quarrel with you.\" But in spite of her hatred for\r\nLodovico, Isabella of Aragon still kept up friendly relations with her\r\nEste cousins. In 1498, she asked the marchioness for an antique bust,\r\nwhich Andrea Mantegna had brought back from Rome, and which she heard\r\nbore a striking likeness to herself. The painter, however, valued the\r\nmarble so highly that for long he refused to part with it, and offered\r\nto send the duchess a cast of the bust in bronze. Isabella d'Este,\r\nhowever, finally prevailed upon him to let her buy the head, and send it\r\nas a present to her cousin, whom she declared it resembled in a\r\nmarvellous manner. At the same time she promised the duchess a replica\r\nof a portrait of her brother, King Ferrante of Naples, which she valued\r\ntoo much to part with, but would have copied as soon as possible by\r\nFrancesco Mantegna. Before satisfying her cousin's wishes, however, the\r\nprudent Isabella applied to the duke and ascertained that he had no\r\nobjection to her action. Again, when in March, 1499, the duchess begged\r\nIsabella to let her have her own portrait, the marchioness sent the\r\npicture to Lodovico, and asked him for leave to send the picture to\r\nGiangaleazzo's widow.\r\n\r\n\"MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE AND EXCELLENT DUKE AND DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I shall weary not only your Highness, but all Italy with\r\nthe sight of my portraits; but reluctantly as I do this, I could not\r\nrefuse the Duchess Isabella's urgent entreaties to let her have my\r\nportrait in colours. I send this one, which is not very like me, and\r\nmakes me look fatter than I really am, and have desired Negro, my master\r\nof the horse, to show it to your Highness, and, if you approve, give it\r\nto the duchess from me.\"[74]\r\n\r\nLodovico replied pleasantly that he admired the portrait, and thought it\r\nvery like Isabella, although it made her look stouter than when he had\r\nlast seen her, but suggested that perhaps she had grown fatter during\r\nthe interval. And the picture was duly presented to Duchess Isabella\r\nthat same day.\r\n\r\nThe marquis's widowed sister Chiara Gonzaga, Duchess of Montpensier,\r\nalso kept up an active correspondence with the Moro at this time, and\r\nwarned him repeatedly of the intrigues against him that were going on at\r\nthe French court, and of the dangers he had to fear from Trivulzio and\r\nthe Venetians.\r\n\r\nSo warm was the friendship between this lady and Lodovico, that a\r\nMantuan doctor wrote from Milan to Francesco Gonzaga, on pretence of\r\nhaving received a commission from the duke to ask for his widowed\r\nsister's hand in marriage, and as well as for that of his youthful\r\ndaughter Leonora on behalf of the young Count of Pavia. The duke wrote\r\nback that he had never seen the doctor, and that the whole was a\r\nfabrication. As he informed Chiara, he had not the smallest intention of\r\nmarrying a second time, although he had already received proposals to\r\nthis effect, both from Naples and Germany. And, by way of\r\npeace-offering, he sent her a beautiful little _niello_ pax, as a\r\nspecimen of the work of his Milanese goldsmiths, and as a proof that he\r\nplaced himself altogether at her service. In return, Chiara sent him her\r\ncordial thanks, and informed him that her brother had given orders for\r\nthe instant arrest of the mischievous doctor, and would see that he was\r\ndelivered into the duke's hands.\r\n\r\nAnother princess, who was in constant correspondence with the Moro\r\nduring these last years, was his niece Caterina Sforza, the famous\r\nMadonna of Forli. Long ago, he had helped her against the conspirators\r\nwho had killed her first husband and besieged her in the Rocca, and ten\r\nyears before, Galeazzo di Sanseverino had won his first laurels at\r\nForli. Since those days, Lodovico had been a good friend to this warlike\r\nlady in all her perpetual quarrels with her subjects and neighbours. \"I\r\nshould be ready to drown myself, were it not for the trust that I place\r\nin your Excellency,\" Caterina wrote to her uncle in 1496. Now that she\r\nhad aroused the wrath of Venice by her alliance with Florence, and that\r\nRomagna was actually invaded by a Venetian force, the duke sent first\r\nFracassa and then the Count of Caiazzo to her help. In her gratitude she\r\ncalled the infant son born of her third marriage with Giovanni de'\r\nMedici, Lodovico, a name which he afterwards changed, to become famous\r\nin history as Giovanni _delle bande nere_. But this _virago_, as\r\nMachiavelli named the gallant lady of Forli, was by no means easy to\r\ndeal with, and she was constantly appealing to Lodovico to settle her\r\ndisputes. One day she welcomed Fracassa as a delivering angel, the next\r\nshe quarrelled with him violently, and turned a deaf ear to the Moro's\r\nadvice to overcome the Condottiere's rudeness by fair words and gentle\r\ncourtesy. After summarily rejecting his suggestion of a Gonzaga bride\r\nfor her son, and informing him that she was about to accept the Count of\r\nCaiazzo's proposals for her daughter Bianca, she changed her mind,\r\ndeclaring the count to be too old, and suddenly bethought herself of\r\nGaleazzo di Sanseverino, as a suitable husband. This proposal, however,\r\nthe Moro promptly declined in a curt note, telling the countess that\r\nMesser Galeazzo had no intention of marrying again.[75]\r\n\r\nBut the days of the once powerful Moro's reign were already numbered,\r\nand the time was coming when he would be in sore need of help himself.\r\nHis subjects were already grievously discontented. At Milan, Cremona,\r\nand Lodi, even in faithful Pavia, there had been tumults and riotings.\r\nIt became increasingly difficult to exact the loans required to meet the\r\nheavy expenses for the national defence, while the ill-paid troops\r\nmurmured, and in many cases deserted the standard.\r\n\r\n\"In the whole Milanese there is trouble and discontent. No one loves the\r\nduke. And yet he still reigns.... But he is a traitor to Venice, and\r\nwill be punished for his bad faith.\" So wrote Marino Sanuto that autumn;\r\nwhile another Venetian chronicler, Malipiero, gave vent to his bitter\r\nhatred in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Lodovico hoped to give the Signory trouble by his alliance with Charles\r\nVIII., but God our protector has taken away that monarch's life, and has\r\nmade King Alvise his successor, who is Lodovico's enemy.\"\r\n\r\nSo the year closed gloomily. The political horizon was black and\r\nlowering, and Lodovico had lost the wife upon whose courage and presence\r\nof mind he had learnt to lean. He was suffering from gout himself, and\r\nwas often unable to mount a horse. But he still found pleasure in his\r\nartistic dreams and in the vast schemes that filled his brain. Already\r\nhe had seen many of his plans carried out. Bramante's cupola and\r\nsacristy were finished and Beatrice's tomb, with the sleeping form and\r\nface, had been exquisitely wrought in marble by the sculptor's hand.\r\nLeonardo had completed the Cenacolo to be the wonder of the world in\r\ncoming ages, and the great equestrian statue was only waiting for better\r\ntimes to be cast in bronze and become a permanent memorial of the proud\r\nSforza race. Now a new and grander vision filled his thoughts. He would\r\nrebuild the convent of the Dominican Friars on a vast and splendid\r\nscale, and make it the most glorious sanctuary in the world, surpassing\r\neven his beloved Certosa, for the sake of Beatrice, and as a living\r\nmemorial of the love which he had borne to his dead wife.\r\n\r\nHe began by rebuilding the friars' dormitories, enlarging their gardens,\r\nand giving them a good water-supply. Then, on the 3rd of December of\r\nthis year, 1498, he drew up a deed by which he granted his beautiful\r\nvilla of the Sforzesca, with the spacious farms and fertile lands which\r\nhad been his pride and pleasure in past days, to the prior and convent\r\nof Santa Maria delle Grazie, in perpetuity. In the preamble to the deed\r\nof gift, the duke expresses his great love for this church, \"where our\r\ndead children repose, and our most dear wife Beatrice d'Este sleeps,\r\nwhere, God willing, we ourselves hope to rest until the day of\r\nresurrection,\" and ends with a devout prayer \"that God and the Blessed\r\nVirgin, the Dominican saints, Peter Martyr, Thomas Aquinas, and Dominic,\r\nSt. Vincent, St. Katharine of Siena, and all the saints, will hear the\r\nprayers offered at these altars by the brothers of the order, and\r\nforgive our failings, increase our merit, preserve our sons, give peace\r\nand tranquillity to our subjects, receive the soul of our dearly loved\r\nBeatrice into rest eternal, and finally place us, when this life is\r\nover, among the holy monarchs and princes of His kingdom.\" This deed,\r\nsigned and sealed by Lodovico's own hand, and beautifully illuminated by\r\nAntonio da Monza, or some miniaturist of his school, is preserved,\r\ntogether with the former privileges granted to the community during the\r\nlifetime of Duke Giangaleazzo, in the collection of the Marchese d'Adda.\r\nEach leaf is elaborately decorated with Lodovico's favourite mottoes and\r\ndevices and other ornaments, while on the first page is a miniature of\r\nthe duke in black cap and mantle, in the act of presenting the act of\r\ndonation to the Dominican prior. After the French conquest of Milan,\r\nLouis XII. annulled this deed of gift, although the friars escaped\r\nfurther spoliation owing to the protection of the powerful Borromeo\r\nfamily, and, after a long dispute, their possession of the Sforzesca was\r\neventually confirmed by Emperor Charles V. An inscription was placed\r\nover the gates of the Sforzesca in honour of Lodovico Sforza and his\r\nwife, and the domain remained the property of the convent until the\r\ngeneral confiscation of Church lands by Napoleon in 1798. Now Lodovico's\r\nfoundation has become national property, the remnants of his spacious\r\nbuildings are used as government schools.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, December 3, 1498, Lodovico made his will, a curious and\r\ninteresting document, which is still preserved in the Milanese archives,\r\nand opens with these sentences:\r\n\r\n\"The holy Fathers teach us that according to the laws of the Eternal\r\nkingdom, ordered by God Almighty, the elect may attain to this immortal\r\nheritage by purifying their souls from every earthly stain. By mourning\r\nfor our sins, by giving alms and making reparation for wrong done to\r\nothers, by fasting, prayers, and good works, we can win everlasting\r\nlife, as has been decreed by God in all eternity. Believing this truth\r\nwith our whole heart, in full agreement with the Catholic faith, and\r\ndesiring to provide for the salvation of our soul as precious above all\r\nearthly treasures, so that by the help of God we may rise purified from\r\nthe stains of this life to enjoy life and peace in the company of the\r\nblessed, we order these things.\"[76] After recommending his soul once\r\nmore to all the saints, mentioned in the former deed, he desires that\r\nhis body, the ducal robes and insignia, may be buried on the right of\r\nhis wife, in the tomb erected by him, in the _Cappella Maggiore_ of\r\nSanta Maria delle Grazie, and further endows the convent with a rent of\r\n1500 ducats, in order that they may never cease to pray for his own soul\r\nand that of his lady, Beatrice. Seven masses, he decrees, are to be said\r\ndaily for the duke, seven for the duchess, five requiems are to be\r\nchanted every Wednesday, and the whole office for the dead is to be used\r\non the 3rd of every month, being the day on which Beatrice died; while\r\nin the church of the Sforzesca, masses are to be said in January and\r\nJune--these being the months of Beatrice's birth and death--for both the\r\nduke and his wife. For a whole year after his death, the alms which he\r\nhas given since the duchess's death are to be continued, a certain\r\nnumber of poor families are to be relieved, and poor maidens and nuns\r\ndowered, who are to pray for the souls of Beatrice and of his children\r\nLeone and Bianca. He leaves 4000 ducats to be distributed yearly in\r\nalms, and 3000 more to pension his old servants, while 5000 ducats are\r\nto be paid to each of his illegitimate sons, Cesare and Gianpaolo. All\r\nhis debts and those of his mother are to be discharged, and a sum of\r\nmoney equal to that which he, his father, and brother Galeazzo had\r\nexacted from the Jews is to be spent in good works. All his gifts to the\r\nDuomo of Milan are confirmed, including the rich plate and vestments\r\npresented by Azzo Visconti to the chapel of S. Gottardo in the old\r\npalace, and removed by Duke Galeazzo to the Castello, but restored by\r\nLodovico.\r\n\r\nTo this same date, another even more interesting document must be\r\nassigned: the political will of Lodovico, which was among the\r\nmanuscripts brought from Milan by Louis XII., in 1499, and is still\r\npreserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale.[77] This document consists of\r\nthirty-four parchment leaves, enriched with delicately painted initials\r\nand the monogram of Lodovico and Beatrice, bound in black velvet and\r\nfastened with gold clasps. By the duke's orders, it was placed in an\r\niron casket, richly ornamented with silver work, bearing his arms and\r\nthose of his wife, as well as the Sforza devices of the lion with the\r\nbuckets and his own favourite emblem of the caduceus. This casket was\r\nsealed with the cornelian engraved with Beatrice's portrait, which\r\nLodovico always used after her death, and deposited in the treasury of\r\nthe Rocchetta, in the charge of the governor of the Castello, to be\r\nopened by him and the chief secretary and chamberlain, immediately after\r\nthe duke's death. The writer begins by explaining that since the\r\npremature death of his wife, in whose wisdom and knowledge he placed\r\nabsolute trust, has deprived his sons of their natural guardian, he has\r\ndrawn up the following instructions for their education and guidance and\r\nfor the proper administration of the State, until the elder of the two,\r\nMaximilian Count of Pavia, shall attain the age of twenty.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he desires the governors and regents set over his son, to\r\nimpress upon the new duke the love and duty which he owes to his Father\r\nin heaven, who is the Disposer of all, and the King of earthly kings,\r\nand under Him to his vicar, the holy pontiff, and his Imperial Majesty,\r\nMaximilian King of the Romans. And immediately on the present duke's\r\ndeath, his son is to apply to the Cesarean Majesty for a confirmation of\r\nthe privileges granted to Duke Lodovico as a singular mark of favour,\r\nafter they had been refused to his father, brother, and nephew. Lodovico\r\nthen proceeds to give minute directions for the constitution of a\r\nCouncil of Regency, the administration of the finances, the punishment\r\nof criminals, appointment of magistrates, and organization of the\r\nnational defences. A standing army of 1200 men-at-arms and 600 light\r\ncavalry is to be kept up, as well as garrisons in the fortresses, and\r\ngreat stress is laid on the selection of tried and trusted castellans. A\r\nspecial paragraph is devoted to Genoa, and Lodovico begs his successor\r\nto pay especial attention to the noble families of Adorno, Fieschi, and\r\nSpinola, warning him that the Genoese are easily led but will never be\r\ndriven, and must be treated courteously, and with due regard. All\r\nimportant questions of peace and war and of making new laws are to be\r\nreferred to representatives of the people, and the voice of the nation\r\nis as far as possible to be consulted in these matters. The young duke\r\nis to make the Castello his residence, and be as seldom absent from\r\nMilan as possible, never going further than his country houses of\r\nAbbiategrasso, Cussago, Monza, Dece, and Melegnano, until he has reached\r\nthe age of fourteen. After that, he may, if he pleases, cross the\r\nTicino, and visit Vigevano and Pavia, but is recommended to be seldom\r\nabsent from Milan, if he wishes to keep the affection of his subjects.\r\nHis education is to be entrusted to none but the best governors and\r\nteachers, who are to train him carefully in all branches of religious\r\nand secular learning, in good conduct and habits, and in the knowledge\r\nof letters, which last is not merely an ornament but an absolute\r\nnecessity for a prince. From his earliest years he is to take his place\r\nin the council, and is to be gradually initiated into the management of\r\naffairs, taught to deliver speeches and receive ambassadors, and\r\ninstructed in all that is necessary to make him a wise and good prince,\r\nwho cares for the welfare of his subjects and is capable of ruling them\r\nin days of peace, and defending them in time of war. One particular on\r\nwhich Lodovico insists is the restraint which he places on his son's\r\nexpenditure. The young prince is to observe great caution in his gifts\r\nto his favourites. Up to the age of fourteen, he is never to give away\r\nmore than 500 ducats at a time, without the leave of his councillors,\r\nand may never give presents exceeding that value to strangers on his own\r\nauthority, before he is twenty. Similar directions are given for the\r\neducation of Lodovico's younger son, Sforza, Duke of Bari, and the\r\nrevenues of his principality are to be carefully invested in Genoese\r\nbanks until he is of age. The wise management of the ducal stables and\r\nof the chapel choir is especially recommended to the regents, and good\r\nhorses and good singers are always to be kept, for the duke's pleasure\r\nand the honour of his name. Minute instructions for the safe custody of\r\nthe treasure in the Rocchetta are given, and the very forms to be\r\nobserved in the payment of public money and in the use of the different\r\nseals affixed to public documents are all carefully determined. Great\r\ndiscrimination is to be observed in the appointment of certain\r\nministers, in the choice of the Podesta of Milan, in the selection of\r\nCommissioners of Corn and Salt, as well as of the officer of Public\r\nHealth, since all three of these departments are of the foremost\r\nimportance in a well-regulated State.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, directions are given as to the ceremonial to be observed\r\nat Lodovico's own funeral, which is to take place before the\r\nproclamation of his successor, who is warned, on pain of incurring the\r\npaternal malediction, not to assume the ducal crown until his father has\r\nbeen laid in the grave.\r\n\r\nThis political testament, which is so characteristic a monument of\r\nLodovico's forethought and attention to detail, and of his enlightened\r\ntheories of government, bears no seal or signature, but ends with the\r\nfollowing lines in the Moro's own handwriting--\r\n\r\n\"We Lodovico Maria, lord of Milan, affirm these orders to be those which\r\nwe desire to be followed after our death, in the government of the\r\nState, under our son and successor in the Duchy. And in token of this,\r\nwe have subscribed them with our own hand, and have appended our ducal\r\nseal.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] G. Uzielli, _Ricerche sopra L. da Vinci_, i.\r\n\r\n[73] L.

He refused to give Lodovico\r\nthe title of duke, addressing him as Messer Lodovico, while he styled\r\nhimself King of France and Duke of Milan, and told the Bishop of Arles\r\nthat he would rather reign over the Milanese for one year than be King\r\nof France during his whole lifetime. At the same time he spoke freely of\r\nhis plans for the conquest of Italy, and told his courtiers that he\r\nmeant one of his sons to be King of Naples, and the other Duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nThese sayings were duly reported to Lodovico by his own friends at the\r\nFrench court, and chief among them M. de Trano, a Provençal gentleman\r\nwho was in constant correspondence with Milan, as well as by the Duke of\r\nFerrara's envoy. Ercole himself is described by French agents as \"_très\r\nattaché à son gendre_\" and Marino Sanuto speaks of him as \"exceedingly\r\npartial to his son-in-law and devoted to him in his secret heart,\" but\r\nhe was far too wise and prudent a ruler to oppose Louis XII. openly.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, long the Moro's firm ally, had turned against him since the\r\ndissolution of his daughter Lucrezia's marriage to Giovanni Sforza in\r\n1497, and the presence of Cardinal della Rovere, who returned to Rome\r\ntowards the end of 1498, increased his hatred of the Sforzas. He was\r\nstill more drawn to France by the offers of Louis XII. to forward the\r\nambitious designs of his son Cæsar Borgia, who had renounced his\r\ncardinal's hat and was seeking the hand of the King of Navarre's\r\ndaughter. The discovery of these intrigues led to a sharp\r\npassage-at-arms between the Pope and Ascanio Sforza in a consistory held\r\non the 3rd of December. The cardinal openly accused his Holiness of\r\nbringing ruin upon Italy, upon which Alexander retorted that he was only\r\nfollowing the Duke of Milan's example. In vain Lodovico endeavoured to\r\navert the gathering storm by entering into negotiations with the French\r\nking, and even approached Trivulzio with that purpose, but all attempts\r\nat a peaceable arrangement were frustrated by Galeazzo di Sanseverino\r\nand Antonio Landriano's hatred of their old rival and the fixed\r\ndetermination of Louis XII. to reign in the Moro's stead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Venetian envoys were secretly plotting the Duke of Milan's\r\nruin, and on the 15th of April the Treaty of Blois was signed and the\r\npartition of the Milanese between France and Venice finally determined.\r\nThe Signory agreed to invade the duke's territory with an army of 6000\r\nmen, and were to receive the district of Cremona in return for their\r\nassistance. This was followed by Cæsar Borgia's marriage to Charlotte\r\nd'Albret, which took place at Blois on the 10th of May. The Pope's son\r\nwas created Duke of Valentinois by the French king, and Alexander VI.\r\njoined France and Venice and publicly declared that the house of Sforza\r\nmust be swept off the face of the earth. At the same time, Francesco\r\nGonzaga made secret advances to Louis XII., who accepted his offers of\r\nservice and advised the Venetians to make peace with him.\r\n\r\nIn his extremity Lodovico turned to his sole remaining ally, the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, and sent Erasmo Brasca and Marchesino Stanga to Fribourg, to\r\nbeg that a German force might be speedily sent to his assistance, while\r\nhe earnestly entreated his niece the empress to plead his cause with her\r\nhusband. Unfortunately, Bianca had little or no influence at the\r\nimperial court, and Maximilian, who would gladly have helped the duke,\r\nwas hampered by want of money and already engaged in war with his\r\nturbulent Swiss neighbours. But Bianca did her best for her uncle, and\r\nin these last days her letters were his chief consolation. She sent him\r\nthe latest and most confidential news, and wrote repeatedly from\r\nFribourg and Innsbrück, encouraging him with hopes of speedy help, and\r\nreminding him how triumphantly he had overcome greater dangers in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nEven now, when his enemies were closing round him and the last struggle\r\nwas at hand, Lodovico still clung to his old ideals. The love of art was\r\nstill the ruling passion of his life, and Leonardo still for him the\r\nprince of painters. On the 26th of April, he made the Florentine master\r\na present of a vineyard which he had bought from the monastery of S.\r\nVictor outside the Porta Vercellina, probably adjoining a house and\r\npiece of land which the painter had already received from him, near S.\r\nMaria delle Grazie. During the last few years the duke, we know, had\r\nfound it increasingly difficult to provide money for his vast\r\nenterprises, and from a rough draft of a letter that has been found\r\namong Leonardo's manuscripts, we gather that the painter's salary was in\r\narrears, and that his equestrian statue had not yet been cast in bronze:\r\n\r\n\"Signore,\" he writes in these fragmentary sentences, \"knowing the mind\r\nof your Excellency to be fully occupied, I must ask pardon for reminding\r\nyou of my small affairs.... My life is at your service; I am always\r\nready to obey your commands. I will say nothing of the horse, because I\r\nknow the times; but, as your Highness is aware, two years' salary is\r\nowing to me, and I have two masters working at my expense, so that I\r\nhave had to advance fifteen _lire_ out of my own purse to pay them.\r\nGladly as I would undertake immortal works and show posterity that I\r\nhave lived, I am obliged to earn my living.... May I remind your\r\nHighness of the commission to paint the Camerini, only asking ...\"\r\n\r\nThe painter, we know, had never complained of Lodovico's want of\r\nliberality, and before he left Milan that December, he was able to send\r\n600 gold florins to Florence, but he probably received the vineyard\r\noutside the gate in answer to this appeal. In the deed of gift, the\r\nduke expressly states that Leonardo, in his judgment and in that of the\r\nbest judges, is the most famous of living painters, and that, having\r\nbeen employed by him in manifold works, in all of which he has shown\r\nadmirable genius, the time has come to put the promises which have been\r\nmade him into execution. Accordingly, the duke presents him with this\r\nvineyard, small indeed compared with the painter's merits, but which\r\nLeonardo may take as a sign that, as in the past, he will always find\r\nthe ducal house sensible of his services, and that Lodovico himself will\r\nin the future more fully reward the master's excellent acts and singular\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nA week later Lodovico remembered the altar-piece which Perugino had\r\npromised to paint for the Certosa, and on the 1st of May wrote to the\r\nCarthusian friars, desiring them to urge the Umbrian painter to complete\r\nand deliver the work without delay.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he wrote, \"how much labour and expense we have bestowed on\r\nthe decoration of the Certosa of Pavia, and how much we rejoice to see\r\nthat the building is nearly finished. And we have always exhorted\r\nyourselves, venerable Prior and brothers, to choose the most excellent\r\nartists to paint pictures that may be at once helps to devotion and\r\nornaments of the church. Since, with this intention, we proposed a\r\ncertain Perugino and a Maestro Filippo, both of them admirable and\r\nhonoured masters, to paint two altar-pieces, and disbursed large sums in\r\norder to obtain these pictures, we are seriously displeased to find that\r\nthree years have passed without the work being done. This is unjust both\r\nto ourselves and the friars, since it deprives the Certosa of the\r\nperfection that we desire to see there, and we must beg you to insist on\r\nthese excellent masters completing the said altar-pieces within a\r\nreasonable term, or else returning the money which they have received.\r\nFor, as you know, nothing is dearer to our hearts than the things that\r\nconcern this church and monastery.\"\r\n\r\nLodovico's exertions were not in vain, at least in the case of Perugino.\r\nBefore the end of the year, the great altar-piece containing the lovely\r\nMadonna and saints, which now adorns the National Gallery, was finished,\r\nand while the duke himself wandered in exile beyond the Alps, the\r\nUmbrian painter's masterpiece was safely placed in the glorious church\r\nwhich he had loved so well.\r\n\r\nThis letter relating to the Certosa altar-piece and the gift to Leonardo\r\nwere the last public acts in which the great Moro showed his love of art\r\nand generosity to artists. His fate was sealed, and already his foes\r\nwere at the door. Before the end of May, King Louis and Cæsar Borgia\r\ncame to Lyons, and Trivulzio descended upon Asti with fifteen thousand\r\nmen. A few weeks later the Milanese envoy to Venice was dismissed, and\r\nthe Venetian army prepared to enter the district of Cremona. Caterina\r\nSforza, almost the only Italian ally who was still faithful to Milan,\r\nsent a troop of men from Forli to her uncle's help, but the invasion of\r\nRomagna by papal troops hindered her from attacking the Venetians as she\r\nhad intended. In vain Lodovico sent despairing letters to Maximilian,\r\nbegging for the promised reinforcements. Week after week went by, and\r\nstill the German troops did not arrive. On the 13th of August, Trivulzio\r\ninvaded the Milanese with a powerful force of well-trained soldiers, and\r\ntook the castle of Annona. The same day the Venetians crossed the\r\neastern frontier and advanced towards the river Adda. On the 14th\r\nLodovico wrote the following letter to his niece, the Empress Bianca:--\r\n\r\n\"In our present great anxieties, while the French are attacking us on\r\nthe one side, and on the other a large Venetian army is advancing, your\r\nMajesty's loving letter has been a great comfort, expressing not only\r\nthe sympathy which you feel in our troubles, but the efforts you have\r\nmade to induce your husband, the king, to help us in these bad times.\r\nWhat you say of his good-will is not more than we expected, but your\r\nkind words have given us unspeakable joy, and we are exceedingly\r\ngrateful, and beg you with all our heart to continue your offices on our\r\nbehalf with the king, entreating him to send us help immediately\r\n(_presto, presto_). Indeed, his troops ought to be here now, for we are\r\nalready reduced to extremity, as you will learn from Messer Galeazzo\r\nVisconti and others, whom we have sent to your Majesty, praying that\r\nhelp may be speedy and effectual.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThree days after, Bianca herself wrote to say that she had spoken to the\r\nemperor, and begged her _maître d'hôtel_ to support her request, and\r\nthat he had solemnly promised to send her uncle help. Maximilian kept\r\nhis word, and before the month was over despatched a strong German force\r\nto the duke's relief. But the sorely needed succour came too late. When\r\nthe Germans reached the Italian frontier, Milan had already surrendered,\r\nand they met Lodovico flying for his life. There were traitors in the\r\nMoro's camp and court. Not only had the Marquis of Mantua broken faith\r\nand refused to defend the Milanese against the Venetians, but two of the\r\nSanseverino brothers, Fracassa and Antonio Maria, had for some time past\r\nthreatened to enter the Venetian service; while Francesco Bernardino\r\nVisconti, the Borromeos, and Pallavicini were secretly corresponding\r\nwith Trivulzio, and the Count of Caiazzo was out of temper and jealous\r\nof his younger brother Galeazzo, if he was not, as Corio and other\r\ncontemporaries affirm, already in league with the French. Galeazzo\r\nhimself, who had the supreme command of the Milanese forces and held\r\nAlessandria with 5000 men, was a brilliant carpet-knight and gallant\r\nsoldier, but had little experience as a general, and had no confidence\r\nin his ill-paid and half-starved troops. When the duke, in a moment of\r\nirritation, reproached his son-in-law with thinking too much of fine\r\nclothes and fair ladies, Galeazzo boldly told him that his subjects were\r\ndisaffected and tired of his rule, and that if he did not take vigorous\r\nmeasures, he would lose his state. His words proved all too true. One by\r\none the fortresses of the Lomellina opened their gates to Trivulzio's\r\nvictorious army, Antonio Maria Pallavicini surrendered Tortona without a\r\nblow, and when Galeazzo prepared to relieve Pavia, his troops refused to\r\nfollow him. At the head of a handful of cavalry, he made a gallant\r\nattempt to reach Pavia, but the citizens, alarmed at the approach of the\r\nFrench, closed their gates and refused to admit any armed men.\r\n\r\nAlessandria was now the only fortified town in the district which could\r\narrest Trivulzio's onward march, and Lodovico, trusting to Galeazzo's\r\nvalour, was confident he would be able to hold the town until the\r\narrival of Maximilian's reinforcements. But, to the amazement of friend\r\nand foe alike, on the night of the 28th of August, Galeazzo, attended by\r\nonly three horsemen, left Alessandria at nightfall, crossed the Po, and,\r\nafter cutting the bridge behind him, rode as fast as he could go to\r\nMilan. There had been dissensions in the garrison, and the soldiers\r\nclamoured for pay and refused to fight, but whispers of darker treachery\r\nwere abroad. The Count of Caiazzo, it was said, had forged a letter\r\npurporting to be from the duke, recalling his son-in-law to Milan on the\r\nspot, and Galeazzo himself afterwards showed the false orders which had\r\ndeceived him to the French and Milanese chroniclers who repeat the\r\nstory. There seems little doubt that Caiazzo's defection was one of the\r\nprincipal causes of Lodovico's ruin, but, whatever the circumstances of\r\nthe case may have been, it is certain that on the next day the French\r\nentered Alessandria without meeting with any resistance, and Trivulzio\r\nsent word to his kinsman Erasmo that before the week was over he would\r\ndine with him in Milan.\r\n\r\nWhen Lodovico heard that Alessandria was lost, his courage failed him.\r\nHe determined to seek safety in flight, and prepared to send his sons to\r\nGermany under the charge of his brother Cardinal Ascanio Sforza and\r\nCardinal Sanseverino, both of whom had left Rome secretly on the 14th of\r\nJuly, and travelled by Genoa to Milan. Once more the duke called the\r\nchief citizens together, and appealed to them, by the love which they\r\nbore to the house of Sforza and the memory of the peace and prosperity\r\nwhich they had enjoyed under his rule, to defend Milan against the\r\nforeign invaders. But already sedition was spreading among the people.\r\nThat evening the ducal treasurer, Antonio Landriano, one of Lodovico's\r\nablest and most loyal servants, was attacked by the mob on the Piazza of\r\nthe Duomo and mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nOn the same day--Saturday, the 31st of August--the duke took leave of\r\nhis sons, and sent them to Como in the charge of the two cardinals and\r\ntheir kinswoman, Camilla Sforza. \"A truly piteous and heart-breaking\r\nsight it was,\" writes Corio, \"to see these poor children embrace their\r\nbeloved father, whose face was wet with their tears.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty mules laden with baggage, and a large chariot bearing Lodovico's\r\nmost precious jewels and 240,000 gold ducats, covered with black canvas\r\nand drawn by eight strong horses, followed in the young princes' train.\r\nAll the rest of the Moro's treasures, including a sum of 30,000 ducats,\r\nhis vast stores of gold and silver plate, and all Duchess Beatrice's\r\nrich clothes and possessions, were left in the Castello, which was\r\nprovided with ample supplies of food and ammunition, and defended by\r\n1800 guns and a garrison of 2800 men, who had received six months' pay\r\nin advance. These the duke entrusted solemnly to the charge of the\r\ngovernor, Bernardino da Corte, leaving him full instructions as to his\r\nfuture course of action, and a system of signals by which he could\r\ncommunicate with friends in the town, and telling him that he would\r\nreturn with 30,000 Germans before a month was over. Both Ascanio Sforza\r\nand Galeazzo di Sanseverino, it is said, entertained doubts of\r\nBernardino da Corte's fidelity, and warned the duke not to leave him\r\nwithout a colleague in this responsible office; but Lodovico did not\r\nshare their fears, and trusted implicitly in the loyalty of this\r\nservant, whom he had advanced from a humble position to fill this\r\nresponsible post and loaded with favours.\r\n\r\nAfter his children were gone, Lodovico drew up a last deed, by which he\r\nleft certain of his lands and houses to his friends in Milan, and made\r\nreparation to others whom he had wronged. Chief among these was the\r\nwidowed Duchess Isabella, to whom he gave his own duchy of Bari, in the\r\nkingdom of Naples, with a yearly revenue of 6000 ducats in place of her\r\ndowry. He restored the lands of Angleria and the fortress of Arona to\r\nthe Borromeos, gave poor Beatrice's favourite country house of Villa\r\nNuova to Battista Visconti, and divided his different domains among the\r\nchief representatives of noble Milanese families, in the hope of\r\nsecuring their allegiance. While he was engaged in this final disposal\r\nof his property, a deputation arrived to inform him that a meeting had\r\nbeen held that day in the Dominican hall of La Rosa, at which the Bishop\r\nof Como, Landriano, general of the Umiliati, Castiglione, Archbishop of\r\nBari, and Francesco Bernardino Visconti were chosen to form a\r\nprovisional committee of public safety, and that these councillors had\r\ndecided to make terms with Trivulzio and admit the French. The duke said\r\nthat he still put his trust in the people; upon which Visconti asked him\r\nwhy, if this were the case, he had sent his sons and his treasure away?\r\n\"If you surrender the city to the French,\" replied the duke, \"I will\r\nhold the Castello for the emperor.\" It was his last word. In vain\r\nGaleazzo urged him to put himself at the head of his loyal servants, and\r\ncall upon the citizens of Milan to man the walls against the French and\r\nfight or die with their duke. It was already too late. While they were\r\nstill speaking, news reached the Castello that the people had risen in\r\ntumultuous uproar, and that Galeazzo di Sanseverino's stables and the\r\nseneschal Ambrogio Ferrari's house had been sacked by the mob. The shops\r\nwere closed, and the houses in the principal streets were barricaded.\r\nTerror and confusion prevailed everywhere, and Milan seemed in a state\r\nof siege. Lodovico now took leave of his faithful servants, and solemnly\r\ncharged Bernardino da Corte to hold the Castello as a sacred trust. \"As\r\nlong as the Rocca holds out, I know that I shall return; but when that\r\nsurrenders, the house of Sforza is doomed.\" With these words he kissed\r\nthe castellan on the cheek, and, mounted on a black horse, in the long\r\nblack mantle which he always wore since his wife's death, he rode out,\r\naccompanied by his chief senators to the Porta Vercellina. There he\r\nturned to his companions, and, with a noble and dignified air, thanked\r\nthem once more for their faithful services, and bade them all farewell.\r\n\"_State con Dio_--may God be with you,\" he said, and, with a last wave\r\nof his hand, put spurs to his black charger and rode off.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting in the western sky, and the sorrowing courtiers\r\nthought that their master had gone to Como. But he alighted before the\r\ngates of S. Maria delle Grazie, and, throwing the reins to a page,\r\nentered the church where Beatrice was buried. There he knelt in prayer\r\nby the tomb of the wife whom he had loved so well and mourned so\r\nlong--_la sua amantissima duchessa_--while the moments slipped away and\r\nhis servants waited anxiously outside. At length he rose from his knees,\r\ntook a last look at the fair face and form lying there in the deep\r\nrepose of death, and left the church, accompanied by the weeping friars,\r\nwho followed him with their tears and blessings to the door. Three times\r\nhe turned round, while the tears streamed down his pale face, and looked\r\nat the stately pile, which held all that had been dearest to him in the\r\nworld--where Leonardo had painted his Last Supper, and where Bianca and\r\nBeatrice slept together. Then, in the dusk of the summer evening, he\r\nrode slowly back through the park and gardens of the Castello.\r\n\r\nAt break of day on the following morning, Monday, the 2nd of September,\r\nDuke Lodovico, accompanied by his son-in-law, Galeazzo di Sanseverino,\r\nhis nephews, Ermes and the Count of Melzi, and his brother-in-law,\r\nIppolito d'Este, and attended by a few armed horsemen, left Milan and\r\nrode to Como. Here the fugitives spent the night, and the duke issued a\r\nlast decree, by which he confirmed the privileges and grants of land\r\nwhich he had granted to the friars of S. Maria delle Grazie. Then he\r\ntold the loyal citizens of Como that he would soon return at the head of\r\na German army, and rode along the banks of the lake to the mountains of\r\nthe Valtellina. Often on the road he looked back at the blue waters and\r\nlovely shores of that native land which he had been so proud to call his\r\nown, and, at last, addressing his companions in the words of the Roman\r\npoet, said sorrowfully, \"_Nos patriam fugimus et dulcia linquimus\r\narva_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only think, reader,\" moralizes Marino Sanuto, \"what grief and shame so\r\ngreat and glorious a lord, who had been held to be the wisest of\r\nmonarchs and ablest of rulers, must have felt at losing so splendid a\r\nstate in these few days, without a single stroke of the sword.... Let\r\nthose who are in high places take warning, considering the miserable\r\nfall of this lord, who was held by many to be the greatest prince in the\r\nworld, and let them remember that when Fortune sets you on the top of\r\nher wheel, she may at any moment bring you to the ground, and then the\r\ncloser you have been to heaven, the greater and the more sudden will be\r\nyour fall.\"\r\n\r\nAlready Ligny's horsemen were scouring the country round Como in pursuit\r\nof the fugitive, and reports reached Venice that the duke had been\r\ncaptured and Galeazzo slain. By this time, however, Lodovico had crossed\r\nthe frontier and was safe on Tyrolese soil. At Bormio he met 2000 German\r\ntroops, who were marching to his relief; and when he reached Innsbrück,\r\nhe found that the Empress Bianca had prepared rooms for his reception,\r\nand received kindly messages from Maximilian, promising him more\r\nefficient support as soon as he had settled his quarrel with the Swiss.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pavia had opened her gates to the French, upon hearing news\r\nof the duke's flight, Trivulzio had taken possession of the Castello,\r\nand Ligny was occupying the Certosa, while Jean d'Auton knew not whether\r\nto wonder most at the rich marbles and sumptuous chapels of the great\r\nchurch, or the vast herds of red deer which roamed in the park.\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" the good Benedictine exclaimed, as he wandered through these\r\nflowery meadows with their banks of roses and myrtles, and clear springs\r\nof running water--\"truly, this is Paradise upon earth!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of September, after a feeble effort on the part of the\r\nMilanese nobles to preserve the rights and liberties of the city, the\r\nkeys were given up to Trivulzio, who entered by the Porta Ticinese with\r\nLigny and two hundred horse, and, after visiting the Duomo, breakfasted\r\nin the house of his kinsman, the Bishop of Como.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Caiazzo had gone out to meet Trivulzio the day before, and\r\nhad been received with great honour, while his brothers Fracassa and\r\nAntonio Maria took refuge with Giovanni Adorno at Genoa, and waited to\r\nsee how the tide would turn.\r\n\r\nStill the Castello held out, and Trivulzio was debating how best to\r\nreduce this almost impregnable citadel, when Bernardino da Corte sent a\r\nherald to parley with Francesco Bernardino Visconti. At the end of a few\r\ndays the faithless governor agreed to surrender the Castello, in\r\nexchange for a large sum of money and the concession of various\r\nprivileges for his family and friends. On the 22nd, letters from the\r\nduke arrived, telling the castellan to be of good cheer, for the German\r\ntroops were on their way. But when they reached Milan, the Castello was\r\nalready in the hands of the French. The treasures of gold and silver\r\nplate which the Rocca contained, the money and the precious stuffs, the\r\npictures and statues and furniture which adorned its _Camerini_, were\r\ndivided between the treacherous governor, Francesco Visconti, and\r\nAntonio Pallavicini, while Trivulzio reserved Lodovico's magnificent\r\ntapestries, that alone were valued at 150,000 ducats, for his share of\r\nthe spoil. Then the wonders of antique and modern art which the Moro had\r\ncollected from all parts of Italy, the paintings of Leonardo and the\r\ngems of Caradosso, the Greek marbles and Roman cameos, Lorenzo da\r\nPavia's rare instruments and Antonio da Monza's miniatures, were\r\nscattered to the winds. Certain things--the gorgeous altar-plate and\r\nvestments of the chapel, with the priceless manuscripts of the Castello\r\nof Pavia, and most of the Sforza portraits--were taken to Blois, others\r\nfound their way to Venice or Mantua, and many fell into unworthy hands\r\nand vanished altogether.\r\n\r\nLodovico was lying ill of asthma in the castle at Innsbrück, discussing\r\nthe best means of relieving the Castello with Galeazzo, when the news of\r\nBernardino da Corte's treachery reached him. For some minutes he\r\nremained silent, as if unable to realize the full meaning of the words.\r\nThen he said to the friends at his bedside, \"Since the day of Judas\r\nthere has never been so black a traitor as Bernardino da Corte.\" And all\r\nthe rest of that day he never spoke again.\r\n\r\nEven the French were filled with horror at Bernardino's treachery, and\r\nshunned him like a criminal when he appeared among them. As for his old\r\nfriends and comrades, the poets and scholars of Lodovico's court, their\r\nindignation knew no bounds, Lancinus Curtius hurled bitter epigrams at\r\nhis head, and Pistoia held him up to the scorn of the whole world in\r\nsome of his finest sonnets. He did not live long to enjoy the reward of\r\nhis treachery and it was popularly believed in Italy that he had\r\npoisoned himself in his despair, or put an end to his wretched life by\r\nfalling upon his own sword. Even Charon, sang the poet, shuddered when\r\nhe heard the traitor's name, and refused to let him enter the gates of\r\nHades.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the conquest of Milan reached Lyons, Louis XII. crossed\r\nthe Alps without delay. On the 21st of September he was at Vercelli; on\r\nthe 26th, at Lodovico's favourite Vigevano; on the 2nd of October he\r\nreached Pavia, where the Marquis of Mantua and the Duke of Ferrara, who\r\nfeared the Pope's vengeance and Cæsar Borgia's army even more than the\r\nFrench, came to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Duke Ercole and his two sons,\" wrote the Ferrarese annalist, \"are gone\r\nto meet the King of France. As for the Duke of Milan, his name is never\r\nmentioned, and you might think that he had never lived.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 6th of October, he made his triumphal entry into Milan,\r\nwith the Dukes of Ferrara and Savoy riding at his side; the Cardinals\r\ndella Rovere and d'Amboise were in front of him; and ambassadors from\r\nall the chief cities of Italy, and a goodly array of princes and nobles,\r\nin his train. Francesco Gonzaga, who had so lately been Duke Lodovico's\r\nguest, was there. And there, too, were men like Caiazzo and Fracassa,\r\nwho had eaten and drunk at the Moro's table, and were fighting under his\r\nbanner only a few weeks before, and with them one, who was still more\r\nclosely associated with Lodovico and his wife by the ties of blood and\r\nfriendship--Niccolo da Correggio, the favourite courtier and poet of the\r\nMoro, and the cousin of Beatrice.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among them all by his height and majestic bearing was the\r\nPope's son, Cæsar Borgia, while the king himself made a gallant show in\r\nhis long white mantle embroidered with golden lilies over a suit of\r\nroyal purple, bearing the ducal cap and sword. Eight Milanese nobles\r\ncarried an ermine-lined canopy over his head, and the doctors of the\r\nUniversity of Pavia were there in their scarlet robes, as they appeared\r\na few short years before at Lodovico's coronation. Fair ladies in gay\r\nattire welcomed the victor with their smiles. Everywhere tall white\r\nlilies were seen blossoming in the streets that led to the Duomo--Notre\r\nDame du Dôme, as the monkish chronicler calls the glorious pile of\r\ndazzling marbles that rose into the summer air. Here the procession\r\npaused, and the king walked up the vaulted aisles to pay his devotions\r\nat the Madonna's shrine. Then he rode on again, to the sound of trumpets\r\nand horns, and the royal guard of Gascon archers led the way up the\r\nwell-known street, with the frescoed palaces and goldsmiths and\r\narmourers' shops, to the gates of the famous Castello, where the victor\r\nentered and took up his abode in this proud citadel of the Sforzas, the\r\ncore and centre of the Milanese.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the French strangers it was all very marvellous--the\r\nbeautiful city with its stately palaces and hospitals, and the fair\r\nchurches with their Gothic spires and pinnacles, their slender creamy\r\nshafts and deep red terra-cotta mouldings; the Milanese ladies with\r\ntheir jewelled robes and mantles embroidered with cunningly wrought\r\ndevices, the flowering lilies and the garlands of laurel and myrtle--all\r\nseen under the radiant sunshine and the deep blue of the Italian skies.\r\nBut what excited their admiration and wonder more than all was the\r\nCastello.\r\n\r\n\"A thing,\" writes one of them, \"truly marvellous and inestimable, with\r\nso many large and beautiful rooms that I lost all reckoning. Without are\r\nbroad lakes, fair running streams, and bridges. There is a fine large\r\nsquare on the side of the town, and on the other are beautiful meadows\r\nand woods and the château, where the Moro had his stables, painted with\r\nfrescoes of different-coloured horses.\"\r\n\r\nKing Louis wondered most of all at the strength and completeness of the\r\nbastions and excellence of the artillery, exclaiming that never before\r\nhad he seen so strong and splendid a citadel! And he and all the\r\nFrenchmen greatly blamed that second Judas, who had betrayed his master\r\nand delivered it up without a blow.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, his Majesty attended mass at S. Ambrogio, accompanied\r\nby the Dukes of Ferrara and Savoy, the Marquis of Mantua, Cæsar Borgia,\r\nand all the cardinals and ambassadors, and afterwards visited the church\r\nand convent of S. Maria delle Grazie. Here he gazed with admiration on\r\nthe Cenacolo of Leonardo, that master of whose genius he had heard so\r\nmuch, and expressed his ardent wish to transfer the famous wall-painting\r\nto France, a sentiment which can hardly have gratified the Dominican\r\nfriars or the Italian princes in his train. The painter was not present\r\non this occasion. His master had fled, the works upon which he was\r\nengaged were all interrupted, and on the approach of the French he had\r\nleft Milan for one of his favourite country retreats in the hills of\r\nBergamo or the mountains of Como, where he could study Nature and pursue\r\nhis scientific researches in peace. And the French king and Cæsar\r\nBorgia, whose genuine appreciation of fine art was well known, did not\r\nfail to admire Bramante's fair chapel and that latest masterpiece of\r\nLombard sculpture, the noble tomb which the Moro had raised to be an\r\neternal memorial of his love and sorrow. There were others in his train\r\nthat day who could hardly look unmoved on the sleeping form of the young\r\nduchess with the child-like face and the brocade robes which _Il Gobbo_\r\nhad fashioned with such exquisite skill. There was her brother-in-law,\r\nFrancesco Gonzaga, and Niccolo da Correggio, in whose heart that fair\r\nface and bright eyes, he tells us, were for ever enshrined; there were\r\nher brothers, Alfonso and Ferrante; above all, there was her father, the\r\naged Duke Ercole. The sight of that marble figure, with the soft curling\r\nhair and the long fringe of eyelashes and quietly folded hands, must\r\nhave vividly recalled the memory of his dead child, and of all the joy\r\nand brightness that had vanished in the grave with Beatrice. For him at\r\nleast that must have been a bitter moment.\r\n\r\nAnd there was yet another, young Baldassare Castiglione, that courtly\r\nand handsome boy who had been sent to Milan a few years before to finish\r\nhis education, and had now followed his master, the Marquis of Mantua,\r\nto wait upon the French king. He had been present many a time at those\r\nbrilliant _fêtes_ in the Castello, and had seen Duchess Beatrice in her\r\nmost radiant and triumphant hour, had talked with Leonardo and Bramante,\r\nand looked on Messer Galeaz as the mirror of chivalry. Now he came back\r\nto find the scene changed and that gay company all dead or gone. And the\r\nnext day he sat down to write home to Mantua and tell his mother of all\r\nthe pomp and splendour of the scenes which he had witnessed. He\r\ndescribed the king's triumphal entry, and the great procession in which\r\nhe had taken part, with all a boy's enthusiasm; but he could not refrain\r\nfrom a sigh over the melancholy change in the Castello, when he told her\r\nhow these halls and courts, that had once been the home and\r\nmeeting-place of rare intellects and accomplished artists, \"the fine\r\nflower of the human race,\" were now full of drinking-booths and\r\ndung-hills--of rude soldiery, who defiled the place with their foul\r\nhabits and polluted the air with their savage oaths. So passes the glory\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] L.

Isabella d'Este,\r\neager to ingratiate herself with the French, invited Ligny to visit her,\r\nand sent dogs and falcons, as well as trout from Garda, to the king, who\r\ntold La Trémouille that he had never tasted better fish. And when\r\nCardinal d'Amboise expressed his admiration for Andrea Mantegna's art\r\nand told the marquis that in his opinion he was the first master in the\r\nworld, Isabella hastened to promise him a picture by the great Paduan's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad time for the followers of Lodovico. The faithful servants\r\nwho had followed him into exile, saw their lands and houses confiscated\r\nand divided among the victors. The Count of Ligny's mother occupied the\r\nMarchesino Stanga's house, and Trivulzio's triumph over his rivals was\r\ncomplete when he received the Moro's palace of Vigevano and Messer\r\nGaleazzo's fair domain of Castel Novo as his share of the spoils. But\r\nno one suffered more keenly or shed more bitter tears than\r\nGiangaleazzo's widow, Duchess Isabella. She had unwisely declined\r\nLodovico's advice to leave Milan when the war broke out, and take refuge\r\non her uncle Frederic's galleys at Genoa. Instead of this, she remained\r\nin Milan and sent her son, a child of eight, whom contemporaries\r\ndescribe as beautiful as a cherub, but weak in mind, like his father, to\r\nmeet Louis XII. on his arrival at the Castello. But, to her dismay, the\r\nking refused to allow the young prince to return to his mother, and when\r\nhe left Milan on the 7th of November, he took the boy with him to\r\nFrance, and made him Abbot of Noirmoutiers, where he lived in retirement\r\nuntil, twelve years later, he broke his neck out hunting. After her\r\nson's departure, the unhappy mother, who signed herself \"_Ysabella de\r\nAragonia Sforcia unica in disgrazia_\" in letters of this period, finally\r\nleft Milan. Early in 1500 she paid a visit to Isabella d'Este at Mantua,\r\nand then travelled by sea from Genoa to Naples, and spent the rest of\r\nher life in her principality of Bari. One of her daughters died as a\r\nchild; the other, Bona, was betrothed to her cousin, Maximilian Sforza,\r\nwhen, in 1512, he was restored to his father's throne. It was Isabella's\r\ncherished dream that her last remaining child should reign over the\r\nduchy of Milan, where, after all, her own brightest days had been spent;\r\nbut before the marriage could take place, the young duke had been\r\ncompelled to abdicate his throne and taken captive to France. His\r\nbetrothed bride, Princess Bona, married Sigismund, King of Poland, in\r\n1518, and six years later her mother died at Naples.\r\n\r\nAfter Louis XII. left Milan, the severity of Trivulzio's rule, and the\r\nviolence and rapacity of the French soldiery, led to increasing\r\ndiscontent among the people, who sighed for the good old days of Duke\r\nLodovico, when at least their life and property, and the honour of their\r\nwives and daughters, were safe. Even on the day of the French king's\r\nentry, Marino Sanuto remarks that Louis was displeased to find how few\r\nof the people cried \"France!\" while the Venetians were greeted with\r\nshouts of \"Dogs!\" and hardly dared show themselves in the streets. \"We\r\nhave given the king his dinner,\" said a Milanese citizen; \"you will be\r\nserved up for his supper!\" Already, on the 21st of September, the\r\nannalist of Ferrara wrote: \"The French are hated in Milan for their\r\nrudeness and arrogance.\" And a private letter, written by a Venetian\r\nfrom Milan, in October, confirms Castiglione's account of the confusion\r\nand disorder that reigned in the Castello.\r\n\r\n\"The French are dirty people. The king goes to hear mass without a\r\nsingle candle, and eats alone, in the eyes of all the people. In the\r\nCastello there is nothing but foulness and dirt, such as Signor Lodovico\r\nwould not have allowed for the whole world! The French captains spit\r\nupon the floor of the rooms, and the soldiers outrage women in the\r\nstreets. The Ducheto has been taken from his mother, who weeps all day\r\nlong. Galeazzo is with Lodovico, Caiazzo with King Louis, Fracassa and\r\nAntonio Maria are at Ferrara, and keep up an active correspondence with\r\nLodovico and Galeazzo.\"[79]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at Innsbrück, the exiled duke was anxiously watching the\r\ncourse of events, and awaiting a favourable moment to return and claim\r\nhis own. \"I will beat the drum in winter and dance all the summer,\" was\r\nthe motto which he adopted, together with the device of a tambourine, in\r\nreference to his future hopes. A letter which the well-known preacher,\r\nCelso Maffei of Verona, addressed to him, moralizing over the causes of\r\nhis fall, and exhorting him to observe the laws of public and private\r\njustice, gave Lodovico an opportunity of issuing a manifesto to his\r\nadherents. In this curious document he defends his conduct, and declares\r\nthat he has no reason to reproach himself for anything in his past life.\r\nHe has always led a Christian life, given abundant alms, listened to\r\nfrequent masses, and said many prayers, especially since the death of\r\nhis dear wife Beatrice. He has ever had a strict regard for justice, no\r\ncomplaint of his subjects has ever been left unheard, and since his\r\nfall, no one has ever reproached him with injustice excepting the\r\nBorromeos, whose alleged wrongs he explains, in a manner to justify his\r\nown action. His whole desire has been to love his subjects as his own\r\nchildren, and seek peace and prosperity for his realm. If he raised\r\nheavy taxes, it was only in order to defend his people from their\r\nenemies, and he never waged war excepting to resist the invasion of\r\nhostile armies. Whatever mistakes he may have made, the Milanese have\r\nnever had reason to complain of him, and have proved this by their\r\nfidelity, only a few captains having sold the fortresses in their charge\r\nand joined the French. And in conclusion he appeals to his old subjects\r\nto restore him once more to the throne of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nHis appeal was not in vain. Niccolo della Bussola and the architect\r\nJacopo da Ferrara, Leonardo's friend, arrived at Innsbrück in December,\r\nbringing the duke word of the disaffection that reigned in Milan, and of\r\nthe prayers that were daily offered up for his return. Cheered by these\r\ntidings, Lodovico determined to leave nothing undone on his part. He\r\npawned his jewels and began to raise forces both in the Tyrol and\r\nSwitzerland. In his eagerness to find allies, he applied to Henry VII.\r\nof England, and even invited the Turks to attack the Venetians in\r\nFriuli. Maximilian helped him with men and money, as far as his slender\r\nresources would allow, and summoned the German Diet to meet at Augsburg\r\nin February, in the hope of obtaining support from the electors. But the\r\nMoro's impatience could brook no delay. At Christmas he came to Brixen,\r\nand there succeeded in collecting a force of eight or ten thousand Swiss\r\nand German _Landsknechten_, supported by a body of Stradiots and his own\r\nMilanese horse. At the head of this little army, Lodovico left Brixen on\r\nthe 24th of January, and set out on his gallant but ill-fated attempt to\r\nrecover his dominions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Girolamo Landriano, the General of the Umiliati, who had been\r\nthe first to yield Milan to the French, was actively engaged in plotting\r\nthe restoration of Lodovico, with the help of the leading ecclesiastics\r\nin the city. \"To say the truth,\" writes Jean d'Auton, \"the whole duchy\r\nof Milan was secretly in favour of Lodovico, and all the Lombards were\r\nswollen with poison, and ready like vipers to shoot out the deadly venom\r\nof their treason.\" A general rising was fixed for Candlemas Day, but so\r\nwell was the secret kept, that not a whisper reached the vigilant ears\r\nof Trivulzio, and all remained quiet until the last few days of January.\r\nOn the 24th, a band of children at play, engaged in a mimic fight\r\nbetween the supposed French and Milanese armies, ending with the rout of\r\nthe French and a procession in which the effigy of King Louis was\r\ndragged through the streets tied to a donkey's tail. Some French\r\nsoldiers, who witnessed the scene, fired on the children, killing one\r\nand wounding others, upon which the citizens rose in arms, and drove the\r\nforeigners back into the Castello. This was followed by a more serious\r\nriot on the 31st of January, and Trivulzio gave orders for a general\r\ndisarming of the people, which, however, he was unable to enforce.\r\nAlready news had reached Como that the Moro had crossed the Alps, and\r\nwas on his way to Milan.\r\n\r\nThe course of Lodovico's victorious march is best described in a letter\r\nwhich he addressed to his sister-in-law, Isabella d'Este, on the day\r\nafter his triumphal entry into his old capital.\r\n\r\n\"ILLUSTRIOUS LADY AND DEAREST SISTER,\r\n\r\n\"On the 24th of last month we left Brixen by the grace of God, and\r\ncrossed Monte Braulio into the Valtellina with a body of\r\n_Landsknechten_. Monsignore the Vice-chancellor, Messer Galeaz, and\r\nMesser Visconti, went on before with the Swiss and Grison infantry, by\r\nway of Coire and Chiavenna, and reached the lake of Como on the 30th.\r\nHere M. Galeaz fitted out eleven ships, with which he attacked and put\r\nto flight the enemy's fleet, and took a fortress occupied by the French.\r\nBoth the Castle of Bellagio and the town of Torno surrendered to His\r\nReverence, who pushed on with his troops to Como, where he met\r\nMonsignore Sanseverino arriving from the Valtellina, and the two\r\ncardinals together did the rest. Monsieur de Ligny and the Count of\r\nMusocho\"--Trivulzio's son--\"who held the town with 1500 horse, fled at\r\nthe approach of the two Monsignori, knowing the feeling of the people,\r\nand his Eminence entered Como amidst the greatest rejoicing in the\r\nworld. M. Galeaz and his light horse pursued the enemy, and Monsignore\r\npushed on towards Milan, hearing from our friends there that his arrival\r\nwas impatiently desired. On Friday, the last of January, some of the\r\npeople rose in arms, and M. Gian Giacomo fortified the Corte Vecchia and\r\nthe Duomo, and, with 2000 infantry, marched through the streets of the\r\narmourers, the builders, and the hatters, to make a public\r\ndemonstration. But our friends waited, knowing that the right moment\r\nhad not yet come. On Sunday, the 2nd, the French captains, hearing of\r\nthe cardinals' approach, and knowing the strong feeling in the city,\r\nassembled their troops early on the Piazza of the Castello. Our friends\r\nwere well prepared, and at the same moment all the bells rang, and the\r\nwhole city rose in arms. More than 60,000 people attacked the French,\r\nand drove them back into the Castello, where they spent the night,\r\nwithout forage for their horses, and on Monday morning, the day before\r\nyesterday, they fled from Milan in terror. The bridges had been broken\r\ndown to hinder their passage, but, luckily for them, the Ticino was low,\r\nand they crossed the bed of the river, and retired to Gaiata in safety.\r\nAnd on Monday the Vice-chancellor entered Milan, amidst universal\r\nrejoicing, and endeavoured to give chase to the French army, but had not\r\na sufficient number of horse to effect his object.\r\n\r\n\"On Monday morning we reached Como, after taking possession of the\r\ncastle on the rock of Musso, and were joyfully received all along the\r\nlake, by the chief citizens and gentlemen of the district, who came out\r\nin boats to meet us. At the gates of the city, the whole population\r\nreceived us with incredible rejoicing and loud acclamations. Yesterday\r\nwe slept at Mirabello, a house of the Landriani, about a mile out of\r\nMilan. All the way from Como crowds of gentlemen and citizens streamed\r\nout to meet us on foot or on horseback, in continually increasing\r\nnumbers, and cries of _Moro! Moro!_ and shouts of joy greeted our steps,\r\nwhichever way we turned. This morning at sunrise we left Mirabello, and\r\nentered the suburb of the Porta Nova, at the hour indicated by our\r\nastrologer, but alighted at Gian Francesco da Vimercato's garden, and\r\nwaited there a little while, to give the gentlemen time to meet us, and\r\nenter the city.\r\n\r\n\"The two cardinals rode out to meet us, and Messer Galeaz and many\r\ngentlemen, with a great number of men-at-arms on foot and horseback, and\r\nwe marched all through the city and up to the Duomo. All the streets and\r\nwindows and roofs were thronged with people shouting our name, with such\r\nrapture that it would be a thing almost incredible if we had not seen it\r\nourselves. And so with universal rejoicing we have returned here, by\r\nthe grace of God, and already we hear that Lodi, Piacenza, Pavia,\r\nTortona, and Alessandria have driven out the French, and returned of\r\ntheir own free will to our allegiance. The castle of Trezzo has\r\nsurrendered, and that of Cassano has been fortified in our name by the\r\nMarchesino, and all the towns on the Venetian frontier have declared for\r\nus, and before long we hope to have recovered the whole state. The\r\nCastello here is still held by 300 French soldiers, but it is badly\r\nprovided with victuals and fuel, and although they have saltpetre, there\r\nis no charcoal to make gunpowder, so we are in good hope of recovering\r\nthe place, but do not mean to let this delay us for a moment in pursuing\r\nour victorious course. The enemy is in full retreat, and we mean to\r\ndrive them back to the mountain passes, and have already sent M. Galeaz\r\nearly this morning with the infantry, and all the horse that we have, in\r\ntheir pursuit. Monsignore Sanseverino is gone to-day, and we follow\r\nto-morrow with all the horse we can collect and a good number of\r\ninfantry, the better to carry out our plans. We hear that the soldiers,\r\nwhich were in Romagna, to the number of 250 lances, besides infantry,\r\nhave been recalled, and have reached Parma, and feel sure that your\r\nlord, the Marquis of Mantua, and our other allies will pursue them, and\r\nwith their help, and the general rising of the people, we trust to\r\nobtain complete victory. We tell your Highness these things the more\r\ngladly because we feel sure that you have been grieved for our trouble,\r\nand will rejoice with us at these fortunate successes. You will forgive\r\nme for not writing in my own hand, because of pressing engagements.\r\n\r\n                        \"LODOVICUS MARIA SFORTIA,\r\n                             _Anglus Dux Mediolani, etc., B. Chalcus_.\r\n\r\nMilan, February 5, 1500.\"[80]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Lodovico wrote to Francesco Gonzaga--\r\n\r\n\"This morning we entered Milan, and it would be impossible to describe\r\nthe immense jubilation of the whole city and all classes of people, or\r\nthe extraordinary demonstrations of affection and good-will that we have\r\nreceived on all sides. Our intention is to follow up our victory with\r\nthe utmost speed, to effect the complete destruction of our enemies, and\r\nsecure the passes neglecting no precaution. To-day we have sent\r\nMonsignore Sanseverino on with ten thousand Germans, and intend to\r\nfollow with the remaining forces ourselves to-morrow. I hope your\r\nHighness will attack and destroy the troops on their way from Romagna,\r\nand if they are already gone, join with the forces of our allies and the\r\nmen of the country in their pursuit, according to the orders that we\r\nhave already issued.\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden revolution took all Italy by surprise. When couriers arrived\r\nin Mantua and Ferrara, saying that Duke Lodovico had that day entered\r\nMilan in triumph, people refused to believe the news. But it was true.\r\n\"The Moro has returned,\" wrote Jean d'Auton, \"and has entered Milan,\r\nwhere he has been received as if he were a God from heaven, great and\r\nsmall shouting _Moro!_ with one accord. Verily these Lombards seem to\r\nadore him. One and all implore him to drive out the French and become\r\ntheir prince again.\" When the people saw the well-known form of their\r\nold duke riding through the streets, clad in rich crimson damask, their\r\nenthusiasm knew no bounds. The two cardinals were at his side, and\r\nMesser Galeazzo rode behind him, in a suit of glittering brocade, with\r\ntall white plumes in his cap and white shoes, \"better fitted,\" remarks\r\nthe chronicler, \"for the service of Venus than for that of Mars.\" They\r\ntook up their abode in the old palace of the Corte Vecchia, near the\r\nDuomo, since the Castello was in the hands of the enemy, and the duke\r\nissued a proclamation, calling on all loyal subjects to restore the\r\npictures, hangings, and other rare and precious objects, which had been\r\ntaken from the Castello. The wealthy citizens parted freely with their\r\ngold and jewels, the Prior and friars of S. Maria delle Grazie melted\r\ndown their sumptuous altar-plate, and the canons of the Duomo brought\r\nthe duke those costly gifts which he had made them in his days of\r\nprosperity. Having thus succeeded in raising 100,000 ducats, Lodovico\r\nassembled the councillors, and harangued them in eloquent language,\r\nreminding them of all they had suffered from the French tyranny, and\r\ncalling on them to join him in delivering their land from this\r\nintolerable yoke. \"I, too, have been guilty of mistakes and faults in\r\nthe past,\" he added, \"but I will repair them. All I ask is to be your\r\ncaptain, not your lord. Help me to drive out the stranger.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the week was over, Jacopo Andrea and his friends had succeeded\r\nin obtaining the capitulation of the French garrison, and the Castello\r\nwas occupied by Cardinal Ascanio, whom Lodovico left with a small force\r\nat Milan, while he himself went on to Pavia. It was on one of the few\r\ndays which he spent in Milan that his meeting with the Chevalier Bayard\r\ntook place, as recorded in the joyous chronicle of the loyal servant.\r\nAfter a skirmish with some of Messer Galeazzo's horse at Binasco, the\r\nyoung French knight who had been too eager in the pursuit of his foes\r\nwas taken prisoner, and brought before the duke at Milan. Lodovico,\r\nwondering at his youth, asked him what brought him in such hurried guise\r\nto Milan, and ended by restoring his sword and horse, and sending him\r\nback to his friends under the escort of a herald, to tell Ligny of the\r\ncourteous treatment which he had received from the Moro, and to say what\r\na gallant gentleman Duke Lodovico was--\"_qui pour peu de chose n'est pas\r\naisé à étonner_.\"\r\n\r\nAt Pavia the Moro was received with the same enthusiastic joy, and\r\nduring the fortnight that he remained there the Castello was bombarded\r\nand taken by his artillery. The next week his native town of Vigevano\r\nwelcomed him with open arms, and the French garrison was forced to quit\r\nthe citadel. But the Venetians held Lodi and Piacenza, and the Duke of\r\nFerrara and Marquis of Mantua, however much they wished their kinsman\r\nwell, and secretly disliked the French, did not dare to incur their\r\nvengeance by any rash action. In vain the Moro wrote passionate appeals\r\nto Francesco Gonzaga from Pavia and Vigevano, urging him to come to his\r\nhelp before it was too late, and pointing out how the safety and\r\nwell-being of Mantua depended upon that of Milan. All the marquis\r\nventured to do was to send his brother Giovanni, with a troop of horse,\r\nto help Lodovico in the siege of Novara, which he now attacked with the\r\naid of fifty pieces of artillery sent from Innsbrück.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his foes were every day gaining strength. King Louis had\r\nhastily collected a large army of French lances and Swiss mercenaries\r\nunder La Trémouille at Asti, who entered Lombardy, and marched to\r\nrelieve Trivulzio and Ligny at Mortara. On the other hand, the French\r\ntroops who had gone with Yves d'Allégre to assist Cæsar Borgia in the\r\nsiege of Forli and conquest of Romagna, speedily retraced their steps to\r\nrelieve the garrison of Novara. But they could not hold out against the\r\nfurious assaults of the Germans and Burgundians, and on the 21st of\r\nMarch the castle surrendered, and the garrison marched out with the\r\nhonours of war. Two days afterwards La Trémouille reached Vercelli at\r\nthe head of his powerful army, and succeeded in effecting a junction\r\nwith Trivulzio's forces. This put an end to the Moro's brilliant\r\nsuccesses, and it became evident to all that the unequal contest could\r\nnot be maintained much longer. Seeing himself outnumbered and surrounded\r\non all sides, Lodovico threw himself into Novara, and early in April was\r\nbesieged there in his turn. But the Swiss, who formed the bulk of his\r\nforce, murmured because they were not allowed to pillage the towns, and\r\nbegan to communicate secretly with their comrades in the hostile camp.\r\nThe Moro had sent Galeazzo Visconti to Berne, and at his request the\r\nHelvetian Diet issued orders to the Swiss in both armies, forbidding\r\nthem to fight against their comrades. But the French envoy, Antoine de\r\nBussy, bribed the herald who bore the message to Novara, and only the\r\nSwiss in the Moro's service received orders to lay down their arms. The\r\nresult was that when Lodovico's captains led them out to meet the enemy,\r\nthey refused to fight, and withdrew in confusion into the city. In vain\r\nthe duke offered them his silver plate and jewels, till he could obtain\r\nmoney from Milan, and begged them to return to the battle. In vain\r\nGaleazzo, at the head of his Lombards, charged the foe gallantly,\r\nkilling many of them with his artillery and putting the others to\r\nflight. He and his brothers fought desperately, till the sword was\r\nbroken in Galeazzo's hands and Fracassa was badly wounded. But all their\r\nheroism was of no avail. Trivulzio was already in secret treaty with the\r\nSwiss, who sent a deputy to the French camp, asking for leave to lay\r\ndown their arms and return to their own country.\r\n\r\nAntonio Grumello, who was in Novara at the time, describes how late one\r\nevening, when the duke sat playing chess with Fracassa in the bishop's\r\npalace, where he lodged, a spy was led in, who told him that Trivulzio\r\nhad boasted that the Moro would be his captive in less than a\r\nfortnight. \"What do you say?\" asked Lodovico of Almodoro, the\r\nastrologer, who had followed him into exile. But Almodoro shook his\r\nhead. It was impossible; no planet foretold such a disaster; on the\r\ncontrary, all the signs were propitious, and he spoke confidently of\r\ncoming victory. \"On Wednesday in Holy Week,\" continued the chronicler,\r\n\"the betrayal of Judas began.\" That day, as Galeazzo was preparing for\r\nanother sally, the Swiss came to him in a body and laid down their arms,\r\nsaying they would not fight against their comrades in the other camp.\r\nAlready one of the gates had been treacherously opened, and the French\r\nwere in the city. In this extremity an Albanian captain offered the duke\r\na fleet Arab horse and begged him to escape. But Lodovico refused to\r\ndesert his friends, and would only accept the proposal of the Swiss\r\ncaptains that he and his companions should assume the garb of common\r\nsoldiers and mingle in the ranks. He covered his crimson silk vest and\r\nscarlet hose, hid his long hair under a tight cap, and took a halberd in\r\nhis hand. In this disguise he was preparing to file out of the camp in\r\nthe ranks of the Grison troops, when a Swiss captain named Turman, and\r\ncalled Soprasasso by the Italians, betrayed him to the French. The\r\nSwiss, it is said, received 30,000 ducats as the price of blood from\r\nTrivulzio, but were discontented with the sum, and quarrelled violently\r\nover the gold among themselves; while the traitor had his head cut off\r\non his return home, and such were the execrations heaped upon him by his\r\ncomrades, that his wife and children were forced to change their name.\r\n\"_E lo quello_\"--\"There he is\"--were the words in which Turman pointed\r\nLodovico out to a French captain, who immediately laid his hand on the\r\nduke's arm and arrested him in the name of King Louis. \"_Son contento_,\"\r\nreplied Lodovico, calmly; and made no further resistance. \"I surrender,\"\r\nhe said afterwards, \"to my kinsman, Monsignore de Ligny.\" Accordingly he\r\nwas delivered to Ligny, who treated him with all respect, and provided\r\nhim with a horse and apparel suited to his rank.\r\n\r\nIt is said that at first he declined to meet Trivulzio, but the\r\nchronicler Prato describes an interview which took place between the\r\nduke and his former captain soon afterwards. Trivulzio, in whose heart\r\nthe old wrong still rankled, greeted his captive with the words, \"It is\r\nyou, Lodovico Sforza, who drove me out for the sake of a stranger, and,\r\nnot content with this, have stirred the Milanese to rebellion.\" Lodovico\r\nmerely shrugged his shoulders, and replied quietly, \"Who among us can\r\ntell the reason why we love one man and hate another?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" adds Grumello, \"poor Lodovico was taken captive, and with him\r\nGaleazzo and Fracassa; but Galeazzo became the prisoner of the Swiss,\r\nand was led away by these Helvetians on a black horse without a saddle,\r\nriding on a sack. And I saw this with my own eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAll three of the Sanseverini brothers were claimed by the Bailiff of\r\nDijon as his prisoners, but Antonio Maria managed to escape from their\r\nhands, and both Fracassa and Galeazzo were ransomed by their relatives\r\nfor one thousand ducats a-piece at the end of a few weeks. Fracassa\r\nsought his wife at Ferrara, and Galeazzo took refuge with the other\r\nMilanese exiles at Innsbrück. The Marchesino Stanga, who was also taken\r\ncaptive at Novara, was imprisoned in the Castello of Milan, and died\r\nthere before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of his capture, Wednesday, the 10th of April, Lodovico\r\nwas taken to the citadel of Novara, where he remained for a week. His\r\nfaithful friends, the good friars of S. Maria delle Grazie, supplied\r\ntheir illustrious patron with a set of silk and gold and silver brocade\r\nvests, hats and shoes to match, scarlet hose, and fine Reims linen\r\nshirts. All Lodovico himself asked for was a copy of Dante's \"Divina\r\nCommedia,\" that he might study it during his captivity. On the 17th he\r\nwas conducted by La Trémouille, accompanied by four servants and two\r\npages, to Susa, where he became so ill that he was unable to continue\r\nthe journey. After a few days' rest he recovered, and was taken over the\r\nmountains to Lyons, in charge of M. de Crussol and the king's band of\r\narchers.\r\n\r\nGreat were the rejoicings among the Moro's enemies when the news of his\r\ncapture was made known. King Louis ordered solemn _Te Deums_ to be\r\nchanted in Notre Dame of Paris, and himself went in state to give thanks\r\nin the church of Our Lady of Comfort at Lyons, while he extolled La\r\nTrémouille as another Clovis or Charles Martel in his despatches. The\r\nPope gave the messenger who brought the news a gift of a hundred ducats,\r\nfor joy, he said, that the traitor-brood was annihilated. The Orsini\r\nlighted bonfires, and the jubilee rejoicings waxed louder and longer\r\nthrough the night. Cardinal Ascanio's palace, with all his treasures of\r\nart, was seized by Alexander VI., and his benefices were divided among\r\nthe pontiff's creatures. In Venice the Piazza was illuminated and all\r\nthe bells rung, while the children and boatmen sang--\r\n\r\n    \"Ora il Moro fa la danza,\r\n    Viva Marco e 'l re di Franza!\"\r\n\r\nand dancing and pageants celebrated the downfall of the Republic's most\r\ndreaded foe. Even in Florence the citizens rejoiced over the fall of\r\nanother tyrant, and raised a crucifix at the doors of the Palazzo\r\nPubblico to commemorate the victory of freedom. Had they known it, they\r\nwere in reality celebrating the loss of national independence, the\r\nbeginning of a long reign of slavery and foreign rule. Seldom has the\r\ncause of freedom and civilization suffered a worse blow than this\r\nbetrayal of the Moro at Novara, which left the Milanese a prey to French\r\ninvaders, and planted the yoke of the stranger firmly on the neck of\r\nNorthern Italy.\r\n\r\nAt the news of his brother's capture, Ascanio Sforza left Milan to seek\r\nrefuge across the Alps, but was himself taken prisoner, with his nephew\r\nErmes, at the Castle of Rivolta, near Piacenza, by the Venetians, who\r\ndelivered them up to the French king. Both were taken to France, and the\r\ncardinal was detained in honourable captivity in the citadel of Bourges,\r\nuntil, in January, 1502, he was released to take part in the conclave\r\nthat elected Pius III. With Trivulzio's return to Milan a reign of\r\nterror began. The city was heavily fined, the partisans of the Sforza\r\nwere exiled or imprisoned, Niccolo da Bussola and Leonardo's beloved\r\nfriend, Jacopo Andrea, were hung, and their limbs drawn and quartered\r\nand exposed to view on the battlements of the Castello, in spite of Duke\r\nErcole's intercession on behalf of the distinguished architect. Pavia\r\nwas sacked by the French, and Lombardy paid with tears and blood for\r\nits loyalty to the race of Sforza. The period of anarchy and confusion\r\nwhich followed is described in mournful language by the Milanese\r\nchroniclers. During the next forty years, the city was continually taken\r\nand sacked by contending armies, her fair parks and gardens were\r\ntrampled underfoot by foreign soldiery, and her beautiful churches and\r\npalaces destroyed by shells and cannon-balls. French and German ruffians\r\ntore the clothes off the backs of the poor, and snatched the bread from\r\nthe lips of starving children. People were everywhere seen dying of\r\nhunger and the grass growing in the squares. There were no voices in the\r\nstreets, often no services in the churches. Silence and desolation\r\nreigned throughout the unhappy city. \"Blessed indeed,\" sighs the writer,\r\n\"were those who were able to seek shelter in flight.\" Beyond the borders\r\nof Lombardy, there were others who grieved over the Moro's fall. In\r\nMantua and Ferrara his friends shed secret tears over his fate. \"Duke\r\nErcole is very sad,\" writes our friend the annalist, \"for his\r\nson-in-law's sake, and so are all the people.\" And Caterina Sforza, in\r\nher lonely captivity within the walls of the Castel' Sant' Angelo, wept\r\nover her uncle's ruin and the downfall of her race. Far away in\r\nFlorence, one artist, who had lived in close intimacy with the Moro for\r\nmany a long year, who had discussed a hundred problems and planned all\r\nmanner of mighty works with him, heard the news with a pang of regret.\r\nLeonardo had been in Venice with Lorenzo da Pavia, the great\r\norgan-master, when the wonderful tidings of the duke's return had come.\r\nHe and Lorenzo must have smiled when they saw the long faces and\r\nsinister air of the grave Venetian senators at this unexpected turn of\r\naffairs. Eagerly they watched and waited and wondered if these things\r\ncould be really true, and if the Moro were to reign once more on his\r\nfathers' throne, and carry out all the great dreams of his soul. And now\r\nit was all over, and the French were supreme in Milan, and the great\r\nhorse on which the master had spent the best years of his life was used\r\nas a target for the arrows of Gascon archers. The duke and Messer Galeaz\r\nwere captives, Sforzas and Viscontis were in prison or exile, and Jacopo\r\nAndrea had died a cruel death. On Leonardo the blow fell with crushing\r\nforce; but he held his peace, and only the few broken sentences in his\r\nnotebook remain to tell of his shattered hopes and of his inconsolable\r\nregrets.\r\n\r\n\"The Saletta above ... (left unfinished).\r\n\r\n\"Bramante's buildings ... (left undone).\r\n\r\n\"The Castellano a prisoner ...\r\n\r\n\"Visconti in prison--his son dead.\r\n\r\n\"Gian della Rosa's revenues seized.\r\n\r\n\"Bergonzio\"--the duke's treasurer--\"deprived of his fortune.\r\n\r\n\"The duke has lost state, fortune, and liberty, and not one of his works\r\nhas been completed.\"\r\n\r\nIn these last melancholy words we read Lodovico Sforza's epitaph,\r\npronounced over him by Leonardo the Florentine.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] M.

That day the King of France's captive was led along the banks of\r\nthe swift Rhone and through the Grande Rue up to the fortress of\r\nPierre-Encise, on the top of the steep hill that crowns the old Roman\r\ncity. The scene has been described in a well-known letter by an\r\neye-witness, the Venetian ambassador Benedetto Trevisano, one of the\r\nenvoys who had been sent, three years before, to meet the emperor on his\r\ndescent into Italy, and whom the Duke of Milan had entertained royally\r\nat Vigevano. The fierce and vindictive tone of the writer, the exultant\r\nspirit in which he triumphs over the fallen foe, is another proof of the\r\nterror and hatred which the Moro inspired in Venice. Trevisano's letter\r\nwas written on the evening of the 2nd of May, and addressed to the Doge.\r\n\r\n\"To-day, before two o'clock, Signor Lodovico was brought into the city.\r\nThe following was the order of the procession: first came twelve\r\nofficers of the city guard, to restrain the people who thronged the\r\nstreets from shouting. Then came the Governor of Lyons and Provost of\r\nJustice on horseback, and then the said Signor Lodovico, clad in a black\r\ncamlet vest with black hose and riding-boots, and a black cloth\r\n_berretta_, which he held most of the time in his hand. He looked about\r\nhim as if determined to hide his feelings in this great change of\r\nfortune, but his face was very pale and he looked very ill, although he\r\nhad been shaved this morning, and his arms trembled and he shook all\r\nover. Close beside him rode the captain of the king's archers, followed\r\nby a hundred of his men. In this order they led him all through the\r\ntown, up to the castle on the hill, where he will be well guarded for\r\nthe next week, until the iron cage is ready, which will be his room both\r\nby night and day. The cage, I hear, is very strong, and made of iron\r\nframed in wood, in such a manner that the iron bars, instead of breaking\r\nunder a file or any other instrument, would throw out sparks of fire.\r\nOne thing I must not forget to tell you. The ambassador of Spain and I\r\nwere together at a window when Signor Lodovico passed, and when the\r\nSpaniard was pointed out to him, he took off his hat and bowed. And\r\nbeing told that I was the ambassador of your Serene Highness, he\r\nstopped, and seemed about to speak. But I did not move, and the captain\r\nof the archers, who rode by him, said, 'Go on--go on!' Afterwards the\r\ncaptain mentioned this to the king, who said, 'Do you mean that he\r\nrefused to pay you any reverence?' adding that such men as this who do\r\nnot keep faith are bad, and so on. And I replied that I should have felt\r\nshame rather than honour if I had received any sign of courtesy from a\r\nperson of this kind. The king was in his palace, and had seen Signor\r\nLodovico pass, and with him were many other lords and gentlemen, who\r\nspoke much of the Moro. His Christian Majesty said that he had decided\r\nnot to send him to Loches as he had intended, because at certain seasons\r\nof the year he himself goes there with his court for his amusement, and\r\nwould rather not be there with him, as he does not wish to see him. So\r\nhe has decided to send him to Lys in Berry, two leagues from the city of\r\nBourges, where the king has a very strong castle with trenches wider\r\nthan those of the Castello of Milan, full of water. This place is in the\r\ncentre of France, and is kept by a gentleman, who was captain of the\r\narchers when his Majesty was Duke of Orleans, and had a body of tried\r\nguards who were trained by the king himself. When the Moro alighted from\r\nthe mule which he rode, he was carried into the castle, and is, I am\r\ntold, so weak that he cannot walk a step without help. From this I judge\r\nthat his days will be few. I commend myself humbly to your Serene\r\nHighness.\r\n\r\n\"BENEDICTUS TREVISANUS.[81]\r\n                    _Eques. Orator_.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, the iron cage seems to have been a fable invented by the\r\nVenetian ambassador, and from all accounts the prisoner was well and\r\nhonourably treated, although the king absolutely refused his request to\r\nsee him during the fortnight that he remained in the fortress at Lyons.\r\nHe received visits, however, from several of the king's ministers, who\r\nall remarked that if he had been guilty of some foolish actions his\r\nwords were remarkably wise--\"_toutefois moult sagement parloit_.\" Anger\r\ngave place to pity at the sight of this victim who had suffered so\r\nterrible a reverse of fortune, and the Benedictine chronicler, Jean\r\nd'Auton, deplores the sad fate of this unfortunate prince, who, after\r\nmany golden days of wealth and prosperity, was doomed to end his life in\r\nweary and lonely captivity far from house and friends: \"_Somme, si le\r\npauvre Seigneur captif, de deuil inconsolable avoit le coeur serrè a nul\r\ndevoit sembler merveilles_.\" The sorrowful destiny of the \"_infelice\r\nDuca_,\" who had once boasted himself to be the favourite of\r\nfortune--\"_Il Figlio della Fortuna_\"--became the burden of popular\r\npoetry, alike in France and Italy. Jean d'Auton himself gives vent to\r\nhis feelings in an elegy on the vanity of earthly glories--\r\n\r\n    \"Si Ludovic, qui jadys pleine cacque\r\n    Heut de ducatz et pouvoir magnifique,\r\n    Est en exil, sans targe, escu ne placque,\r\n    Captif, afflict, plus mausain que cung heticque,\r\n    Et que, de main hostile et inimique,\r\n    Malheur le fiere rudement et estocque--\r\n    Gloire mondaine est fragile et caducque.\"\r\n\r\nThe grief of the Milanese bards for their duke's cruel fate found\r\nutterance in the following lament:\r\n\r\n    Son quel duca in Milano\r\n    Che compianto sto in dolore ...\r\n    Io diceva che un sel Dio\r\n    Era in cielo e un Moro in terra--\r\n    E secondo il mio disio\r\n    Io faveva pace e guerra\r\n    Son quel duca di Milano,\" etc.\r\n\r\nFausto Andrelino wrote a Latin poem beginning with the lines--\r\n\r\n    \"Ille ego sum Maurus, franco qui captus ab hoste\r\n    Exemplum instabilis non leve sortis eo;\"\r\n\r\nand Jean Marot found inspiration in a Venetian song--\"Ogni fumo viene al\r\nbasso\"--which he rendered in the following lines, alluding to the legend\r\nof the Moro's fresco in the Castello of Milan:--\r\n\r\n    \"Jadiz fist paindre une dame, embellie\r\n    Par sur sa robe, des villes d'Ytalie\r\n    Et luy au près tenant des epoussetes,\r\n    Voullant dire, par superbe follie,\r\n    Que l'Ytalie estoit toute sonillie\r\n    Et qu'il voulloit faire les villes nettes.\r\n    Le roi Loys, voulant ravoir ses mettes,\r\n    Par bonne guerre luy a fait tel ennuy\r\n    Que l'Ytalie est nettoyé de lui!\r\n    Chose usurpée legier est consommée,\r\n    Comme argent vif qui retourne en fumée.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Lyons the captive duke was removed to Lys Saint-Georges in Berry,\r\nwhere he remained during the next four years in the charge of Gilbert\r\nBertrand, the king's old captain of the guard. He was allowed to take\r\nexercise in the precincts of the castle and to fish in the moat.\r\nAccording to Sanuto, he was not wholly cut off from his friends. \"Since\r\nhe likes to know what is happening in the world outside, the king allows\r\nhim to receive letters and to hear the news.\" But his health suffered\r\nfrom the confinement, and in the summer of 1501, he became so ill that\r\nLouis XII., who was hunting in the neighbourhood, sent his doctor,\r\nMaitre Salomon, to see him. The physician was shocked at the prisoner's\r\naltered appearance; his long hair, as we learn from a contemporary\r\nminiature, had turned entirely white, and there were black circles round\r\nhis eyes. He sighed constantly, complained of the faithless subjects who\r\nhad caused his ruin, and asked eagerly for the latest news of the treaty\r\nwith the King of the Romans. Maitre Salomon told the king that he\r\nbelieved Signor Lodovico was losing his reason, and his account moved\r\nLouis so much that he sent to Milan for one of the duke's favourite\r\ndwarfs, in order to beguile the weary hours of captivity. Meanwhile, in\r\njustice to Maximilian, it must be said that he was untiring in his\r\nefforts to obtain the release of his friend and kinsman. For many years\r\nhe steadily refused to grant Louis XII. the investiture of Milan, unless\r\nLodovico was set at liberty, and repeated his solicitations to this\r\neffect with the most unwearied pertinacity. On this point, however, the\r\nFrench king was inexorable. He knew the hold which the Moro had retained\r\non the hearts of his subjects, and would not run the risk of another\r\nrebellion by allowing Lodovico to join his children at Innsbrück. At the\r\nprayer of the Empress Bianca, he released her brother, Ermes Sforza, in\r\n1502, and a year later allowed Ascanio Sforza to return to Rome, at the\r\nrequest of Cardinal d'Amboise, and give his vote in the papal conclave.\r\nAfter the accession of his old enemy, Giuliano della Rovere, to the\r\npapal throne, Cardinal Sforza once more attained a high degree of honour\r\nand prosperity, and when he died, in 1505, Julius II. raised the\r\nmagnificent monument in the church of S. Maria del Popolo to his memory.\r\nIn February, 1504, the German ambassador made another strong appeal to\r\nthe king on his master's behalf for Lodovico's release, but the only\r\nconcession that he could obtain was some relaxation in the rigour of his\r\ntreatment. The duke was removed to the château of Loches in Touraine, a\r\nhealthy and beautiful spot, on the summit of a lofty hill, and was\r\nallowed greater liberty and more society.\r\n\r\nAll contemporary writers agree that he bore his long and tedious\r\ncaptivity with remarkable patience and fortitude. \"I have heard,\" writes\r\nthe Como historian, Paolo Giovio, \"from Pier Francesco da Pontremoli,\r\nwho was the duke's faithful companion and servant during his captivity,\r\nthat he bore his miserable condition with pious resignation and\r\nsweetness, often saying that God had sent him these tribulations as a\r\npunishment for the sins of his youth, since nothing but the sudden might\r\nof destiny could have subverted the counsels of human wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1508, the Moro seems to have made a desperate\r\nattempt to escape. According to the Milanese chronicler Prato, he bribed\r\none of his guardians, with gold supplied, as we learn, from Padre\r\nGattico, by the friars of S. Maria delle Grazie, and succeeded in making\r\nhis way out of the castle gates hidden in a waggon load of straw. But he\r\nlost his way in the woods that surround Loches, and after wandering all\r\nnight in search of the road to Germany, he was discovered on the\r\nfollowing day by blood-hounds, who were put upon his track. After this,\r\nhis captivity became more severe. He was deprived of books and writing\r\nmaterials and cut off from intercourse with the outer world. It was\r\nthen, too, in all likelihood, that he was confined in the subterranean\r\ndungeon, still shown as the Moro's prison. The cell, as visitors to\r\nLoches remember, is cut out of the solid rock, and light and air can\r\nonly penetrate by one narrow loophole. There, tradition says, Leonardo's\r\npatron, the great duke who had once reigned over Milan, beguiled the\r\nweary hours of his captivity by painting red and blue devices and\r\nmottoes on his prison walls. Among these rude attempts at decoration we\r\nmay still discover traces of a portrait of himself in casque and armour,\r\nand a sun-dial roughly scratched on the stone opposite the slit in the\r\nrock. And there, too, half effaced by the damp, are fragments of\r\ninscriptions, which tell the same piteous tale of regret for vanished\r\ndays and weary longings for the end that would not come.\r\n\r\n    \"Quand Mort me assault et que je ne puis mourir\r\n    Et se courir on ne me veult, mais me faire rudesse\r\n    Et de liesse me voir bannir. Que dois je plus guèrir?\"\r\n\r\nOr this--\r\n\r\n\"Je porte en prison pour ma device que je m'arme de patience par force\r\nde peine que l'on me fait pouster\" (porter) . .\r\n\r\nAgain, in large letters among the fragment of red and blue paint, we\r\nread--\r\n\r\n    \"Celui qui ne craint fortune n'est pas bien saige.\"\r\n\r\nEven more pathetic, when we recall the joyous days at Milan and\r\nVigevano, where Lodovico listened to readings from Dante in Beatrice's\r\nrooms, is the following version of Francesca da Rimini's famous lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Il n'y au monde plus grande destresse,\r\n    Du bon tempts soi souvenir en la tristesse.\"\r\n\r\nAt length death brought the desired release. Marino Sanuto briefly\r\nrecords the fact in the following words: \"On the 17th day of May, 1508,\r\nat Loches, Signor Lodovico Sforza, formerly Duke of Milan, who was there\r\nin prison, died as a good Christian with the rites of the Catholic\r\nChurch.\" All we know besides is that his faithful servant, Pier\r\nFrancesco, was with him to the end, and closed his eyes in the last\r\nsleep. To this day the place of his burial remains unknown. A local\r\ntradition says that he was interred in the church of Loches at the\r\nentrance of the choir, but a manuscript account of the Sieur Dubuisson's\r\ntravels in 1642, preserved in the Mazarin Library, states that Ludovic\r\nSforza sleeps in the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre on the eastern side of\r\nthe church. On his death-bed, it is said, he desired to be buried in the\r\nchurch of the Dominican friars at Tarascon, but we never hear if his\r\nwishes were carried out, and no trace of his burial is to be found in\r\nthis place. On the whole we are inclined to think the most trustworthy\r\nauthority on the subject is the Dominican historian of S. Maria delle\r\nGrazie, Padre Gattico. In the history of the convent which he wrote a\r\nhundred and fifty years after the Moro's death, he tells us that the\r\nfriars of his convent supplied the duke with means for his unfortunate\r\nattempt to escape, and that this having failed, after his death they\r\nremoved his body to Milan, and buried him by the side of his wife,\r\nDuchess Beatrice. This may very well have been effected during the reign\r\nof Lodovico's son Maximilian, who was restored to his father's throne in\r\n1512, and would explain the uncertainty which has always existed at\r\nLoches as to the Moro's grave, and the absence of any inscription to\r\nmark his burial-place.\r\n\r\nFor Lodovico's sake, let us hope, the good Dominican's story is true. It\r\nis good to think that, after all the distress of those long years of\r\nexile and captivity, the unfortunate prince should have been brought\r\nback to rest in his own sunny Milanese, under Bramante's cupola, in the\r\ntomb where he had wished to lie, at Beatrice's side. There, during the\r\nnext three centuries, masses were duly said for the repose of Duke\r\nLodovico's soul and that of his wife, on the four anniversaries sacred\r\nto their memory, \"in gratitude,\" writes Padre Pino, \"for all the\r\nbenefactions that we have received from this duke and duchess.\" And to\r\nthis day, on the Feast of All Souls, the stone floor immediately in\r\nfront of the high altar, where Beatrice's monument once stood, is\r\nsolemnly censed, year by year, in memory of the illustrious dead who\r\nsleep there, in Lodovico's own words, \"until the day of resurrection.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[81] M.

A\r\ndocument among the Italian papers in the Bibliothèque Nationale gives a\r\nlong list of the Milanese exiles who, in the year 1503, were living in\r\nexile, and whose lands and fortunes had been granted to French nobles or\r\nItalians who had embraced Louis XII.'s party. Among them we recognize\r\nmany familiar names, Crivellis, Bergaminis, Marlianis, and Viscontis,\r\nwho had served Duke Lodovico loyally and now shared in his disgrace.\r\nMany of these took refuge at Ferrara and Mantua; others went to Rome or\r\nlived in retirement on Venetian territory, while as many as two hundred\r\nand fifty were living at one time at Innsbrück. A few of these were\r\npardoned in course of years, and obtained leave to return to their\r\nLombard homes, but by far the greater number died in exile.\r\n\r\nChief among those courtiers and captains of the Moro who found refuge at\r\nMaximilian's court were the Sanseverino brothers. Two of these, Fracassa\r\nand Antonio Maria, were soon reconciled with King Louis by the powerful\r\ninfluence of their brothers, the Count of Caiazzo and Cardinal\r\nSanseverino. For Galeazzo, the son-in-law and prime favourite of the\r\nMoro, a strange future was in store. After his brilliant years at the\r\ncourt of Milan, he, too, tasted how salt the bread of exile is, and how\r\nbitter it is to depend on the charity of others. In 1503, he was still\r\nliving at Innsbrück, where Sanuto describes him as always dressed in\r\nblack and looking very sorrowful, and held of little account by the\r\nGerman courtiers, although Maximilian always treated him kindly. He\r\naccompanied the Emperor to the Diet at Augsburg, and took an active part\r\nin his various efforts to obtain Lodovico's deliverance. But a year\r\nlater, when all hope of obtaining Lodovico's release was at an end, a\r\nfresh attempt seems to have been made by the Sanseverino family to\r\nreconcile Galeazzo with King Louis. He came to Milan and saw the\r\nCardinal d'Amboise, who embraced his cause warmly, and a petition for\r\nthe restoration of Galeazzo's houses and estates, as well as the fortune\r\nof 240,000 ducats which he had inherited from his wife Bianca, was\r\naddressed to the King. The result was that he soon received a summons to\r\nthe French court, where he quickly won the royal favour, and on the\r\ndeath of Pierre d'Urfé a year later, was appointed Grand Ecuyer de\r\nFrance. From that time Galeazzo became one of Louis XII.'s chief\r\nfavourites, and seldom left the king's side. In 1507 he attended Louis\r\nXII. when he entered Milan for the second time, and was a conspicuous\r\nfigure in the grand tournament that was held on the Piazza of the\r\nCastello. Once more he came back to the scene of his old triumphs, under\r\nthese changed circumstances, and played a leading part in the wars that\r\ndistracted the Milanese. Under Francis I., Galeazzo rose still higher in\r\nthe royal favour, and won a signal victory over his old rival Trivulzio.\r\nThe Grand Ecuyer boldly asserted his right to Castel Novo, which Louis\r\nXII. had granted to Trivulzio after the conquest of Milan, and, at the\r\nage of seventy, the old soldier came to Paris to plead his cause against\r\nMesser Galeazzo. But the suit was given against him, and he was thrown\r\ninto prison for contempt of the king's majesty, and died at Chartres in\r\n1518, bitterly rueing the day when he had entered the service of a\r\nforeign prince and led the French against Milan. Galeazzo triumphed once\r\nmore, and kept up his reputation as a gallant soldier and brilliant\r\ncourtier, until, in 1525, he was slain in the battle of Pavia, under\r\nthe walls of the Castello, where, thirty-five years before, he had been\r\nwedded to Bianca Sforza.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Beatrice's sons grew up at Innsbrück, under the care of their\r\ncousin, the Empress Bianca. It was a melancholy life for these young\r\nprinces, born in the purple and reared in all the luxury and culture of\r\nMilan. And when their cousin Bianca died in 1510, they lost their best\r\nfriend. But a sudden and unexpected turn of the tide brought them once\r\nmore to the front. That warlike pontiff, Julius II., who, as Cardinal\r\ndella Rovere, had been one of the chief instruments in bringing the\r\nFrench into Italy, entered into a league with Maximilian to expel them\r\nand reinstate the son of the hated Moro on the throne of Milan. They\r\nsucceeded so well that, in 1512, four years after Lodovico's death at\r\nLoches, young Maximilian Sforza entered Milan in triumph, amidst the\r\nenthusiastic applause of the people. Once more he rode up to the gates\r\nof the Castello where he was born, and took up his abode there as\r\nreigning duke. But his rule over Lombardy was short. A handsome, gentle\r\nyouth, without either his father's talents or his mother's high spirit,\r\nMaximilian was destined to become a passive tool in the hands of\r\nstronger and more powerful men. His weakness and incapacity soon became\r\napparent, and when, three years later, the new French king, Francis I.,\r\ninvaded the Milanese, and defeated the Italian army at Marignano, the\r\nyoung duke signed an act of abdication, and consented to spend the rest\r\nof his life in France. There he lived in honourable captivity, content\r\nwith a pension allowed him by King Francis and with the promise of a\r\ncardinal's hat held out to him by the Pope, until he died, in May, 1530,\r\nand was buried in the Duomo of Milan. His brother Francesco was a far\r\nmore spirited and courageous prince, who might have proved an admirable\r\nruler in less troublous times, but was doomed to experience the\r\nstrangest vicissitudes of fortune. After the second conquest of Milan by\r\nthe French, he retired to Tyrol, until, in 1521, Pope Leo X. combined\r\nwith Charles V. to oppose Francis I., and restore the Sforzas. Their\r\naims were crowned with success, and by the end of the year Francesco\r\nSforza was proclaimed Duke of Milan, only to be driven from his throne\r\nagain three years later. After the defeat of Pavia, the young duke, who\r\nhad won the love of all his subjects, was again restored; but having\r\nentered into a league with the Pope and Venice to expel the\r\nImperialists, incurred the displeasure of Charles V., and was besieged\r\nin the Castello by the Connétable de Bourbon, who at length forced him\r\nto surrender. A prolonged struggle followed, in which Francesco Sforza\r\nwas often worsted, and at one time forced to retire to Como. In the end,\r\nhowever, he was restored to the throne by Charles V., whose favour he\r\nsucceeded in recovering, when, in 1530, that monarch visited Italy to\r\nreceive the imperial crown. At length this long-distracted realm enjoyed\r\nan interval of peace, and a brighter day seemed about to dawn for the\r\nunhappy Milanese.\r\n\r\nThe young duke was very popular with the people, who rejoiced in having\r\na prince of their own once more, and who, in Guicciardini's words,\r\nlooked to see a return of that felicity which they had enjoyed during\r\nhis father's reign. When, in 1534, he married Charles V.'s niece,\r\nChristina of Denmark, the splendour of the wedding _fêtes_, the balls\r\nand tournaments that took place in the Castello, recalled the glories of\r\nLodovico's reign and the marriage of the Empress Bianca. The charms of\r\nthe youthful bride revived the memory of the duke's mother, Beatrice\r\nd'Este, and a richly illuminated book of prayers, prepared in honour of\r\nthis occasion, and adorned with miniatures and Sforza devices, bore\r\nwitness to Francesco's artistic tastes, and showed his desire to tread\r\nin his father's steps. But these bright prospects were soon clouded. The\r\nyoung duke became seriously ill, owing to a dangerous wound which he had\r\nreceived from an assassin, Bonifazio Visconti, twelve years before, and,\r\nafter lingering through the summer months, he died on All Souls' Day,\r\n1535, to the consternation of the whole Milanese, On the 19th of\r\nNovember the last of the Sforzas was buried with royal pomp in the Duomo\r\nof Milan, and his childless widow, the youthful Duchess Christina,\r\nretired to the city of Tortona, which had been given her as her marriage\r\nportion. Her portrait, painted by the hand of Holbein, is familiar to us\r\nall as well as \"the few words she wisely spoke,\" when, in reply to Henry\r\nVIII.'s offer of marriage, she said \"that unfortunately she had only one\r\nhead, but that if she had two, one should be at his Majesty's service.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tomb of Lodovico Sforza and Beatrice d'Este Contessa of\r\nPavia.]\r\n\r\nA week or two later, Lodovico Sforza's only remaining son, Gianpaolo,\r\nthe child of Lucrezia Crivelli, who had fought gallantly against French\r\nand Imperialists in defence of his brother's rights, died on his way to\r\nNaples. With him the last claimant to the throne of the Sforzas passed\r\naway. The duchy of Milan reverted to the Imperial crown, and this fair\r\nand prosperous realm sank into a mere province of Charles V.'s vast\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThirty years after the last Sforza duke had been laid in his grave, the\r\nnoble monument which the Moro had raised to his wife's memory in S.\r\nMaria delle Grazie was broken up. The friars who had known Lodovico and\r\nrevered his memory were dead and gone, and the Prior then in office,\r\nseized with iconoclastic zeal, ordered the monument to be removed from\r\nthe choir, in accordance with a canon of the Council of Trent. The tomb\r\nwas taken to pieces, and Cristoforo Solari's beautiful effigies of the\r\nduke and duchess were offered for sale. Fortunately, the news of this\r\nact of vandalism reached the ears of the Carthusians at Pavia, and\r\nremembering how much they owed to the Moro's generosity, they sent word\r\nto a Milanese citizen, Oldrado Lampugnano, to purchase the two marble\r\nstatues for the Certosa. Oldrado, whose father had been exiled after the\r\nMoro's fall, and who was himself a loyal partisan of the house of\r\nSforza, bought Solari's effigies for the small sum of thirty-eight\r\nducats, and removed them to the Certosa, \"that shrine which had been so\r\noften visited by the said duke and duchess in their lifetime, and for\r\nwhich they had ever shown the greatest love and honour.\"\r\n\r\nThere we see them to-day--Lodovico with the hooked nose and bushy\r\neyebrows, in all the pride of his ducal robes, and Beatrice at his side,\r\nin the charm and purity of her youthful slumber, surrounded by other\r\nmemorials of Sforzas and Viscontis, wrought with the same exquisite art\r\nand enriched with the same wealth of ornament. After all, these marble\r\nforms could hardly find a better home than the great Lombard sanctuary\r\nwhich was so closely linked with the brightest days of Beatrice's wedded\r\nlife, and which to the last remained the object of Lodovico Sforza's\r\ncare and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAgnese di Maino, 16\r\n\r\nAlbergati, 151\r\n\r\nAldo Manuzio, 30, 126, 131, 153, 261\r\n\r\nAlessandro Manuzio, 131\r\n\r\nAlexander VI.
