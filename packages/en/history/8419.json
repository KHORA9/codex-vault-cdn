Milford & Worrell together with Messrs. A. Chouteau,\r\nC. Gratiot, and many other respectable inhabitants of St. Louis, who\r\nhad engaged to accompany me to the Vilage of St. Charles; accordingly\r\nat 12 Oclk after bidding an affectionate adieu to my Hostis, that\r\nexcellent woman the spouse of Mr. Peter Chouteau, and some of my fair\r\nfriends of St. Louis, we set forward to that village in order to join\r\nmy friend companion and fellow labourer Capt. William Clark who had\r\npreviously arrived at that place with the party destined for the\r\ndiscovery of the interior of the continent of North America the first 5\r\nmiles of our rout laid through a beatifull high leavel and fertile\r\nprarie which incircles the town of St. Louis from N. W. to S. E. the\r\nlands through which we then passed are somewhat broken up fertile the\r\nplains and woodlands are here indiscriminately interspersed untill you\r\narrive within three miles of the vilage when the woodland commences and\r\ncontinues to the Missouri the latter is extreamly fertile. At half\r\nafter one P.M. our progress was interrupted the near approach of a\r\nviolent thunder storm from the N. W. and concluded to take shelter in a\r\nlittle cabbin hard by untill the rain should be over; accordingly we\r\nalighted and remained about an hour and a half and regailed ourselves\r\nwith a could collation which we had taken the precaution to bring with\r\nus from St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe clouds continued to follow each other in rapaid succession,\r\ninsomuch that there was but little prospect of it's ceasing to rain\r\nthis evening; as I had determined to reach St. Charles this evening and\r\nknowing that there was now no time to be lost I set forward in the\r\nrain, most of the gentlemen continued with me, we arrived at half after\r\nsix and joined Capt Clark, found the party in good health and sperits.\r\nsuped this evening with Monsr. Charles Tayong a Spanish Ensign & late\r\nCommandant of St. Charles at an early hour I retired to rest on board\r\nthe barge--St. Charles is situated on the North bank of the Missouri 21\r\nMiles above it's junction with the Mississippi, and about the same\r\ndistance N. W. from St. Louis; it is bisected by one principal street\r\nabout a mile in length runing nearly parrallel with the river, the\r\nplain on which it stands-is narrow tho sufficiently elivated to secure\r\nit against the annual inundations of the river, which usually happen in\r\nthe month of June, and in the rear it is terminated by a range of small\r\nhills, hence the appellation of petit Cote, a name by which this vilage\r\nis better known to the French inhabitants of the Illinois than that of\r\nSt. Charles. The Vilage contains a Chappel, one hundred dwelling\r\nhouses, and about 450 inhabitants; their houses are generally small and\r\nbut illy constructed; a great majority of the inhabitants are miserably\r\npour, illiterate and when at home excessively lazy, tho they are polite\r\nhospitable and by no means deficient in point of natural genious, they\r\nlive in a perfect state of harmony among each other; and plase as\r\nimplicit confidence in the doctrines of their speritual pastor, the\r\nRoman Catholic priest, as they yeald passive obedience to the will of\r\ntheir temporal master the commandant. a small garden of vegetables is\r\nthe usual extent of their cultivation, and this is commonly imposed on\r\nthe old men and boys; the men in the vigor of life consider the\r\ncultivation of the earth a degrading occupation, and in order to gain\r\nthe necessary subsistence for themselves and families, either undertake\r\nhunting voyages on their own account, or engage themselves as hirelings\r\nto such persons as possess sufficient capital to extend their traffic\r\nto the natives of the interior parts of the country; on those voyages\r\nin either case, they are frequently absent from their families or homes\r\nthe term of six twelve or eighteen months and alwas subjected to severe\r\nand incessant labour, exposed to the ferosity of the lawless savages,\r\nthe vicissitudes of weather and climate, and dependant on chance or\r\naccident alone for food, raiment or relief in the event of malady.\r\nThese people are principally the decendants of the Canadian French, and\r\nit is not an inconsiderable proportian of them that can boast a small\r\ndash of the pure blood of the aboriginees of America. On consulting\r\nwith my friend Capt. C. I found it necessary that we should pospone our\r\ndeparture untill 2 P M. the next day and accordingly gave orders to the\r\nparty to hold themselves in readiness to depart at that hour.\r\n\r\nCaptn. Clark now informed me that having gotten all the stores on board\r\nthe Barge and perogues on the evening of the 13th of May he determined\r\nto leave our winter cantainment at the mouth of River Dubois the next\r\nday, and to ascend the Missouri as far as the Vilage of St. Charles,\r\nwhere as it had been previously concerted between us, he was to wait my\r\narrival; this movement while it advanced us a small distance on our\r\nrout, would also enable him to determine whether the vessels had been\r\njudiciously loaded and if not timely to make the necessary alterations;\r\naccordingly at 4 P.M. on Monday the 14th of May 1804, he embarked with\r\nthe party in the presence of a number of the neighbouring Citizens who\r\nhad assembled to witness his departure. during the fore part of this\r\nday it rained excessively hard. In my last letter to the President\r\ndated at St. Louis I mentioned the departure of Capt. Clark from River\r\nDubois on the 15th Inst, which was the day that had been calculated on,\r\nbut having completed the arrangements a day earlyer he departed on the\r\n14th as before mentioned. On the evening of the 14th the party halted\r\nand encamped on the upper point of the first Island which lyes near the\r\nLarbord shore, on the same side and nearly opposite the center of this\r\nIsland a small Creek disimbogues called Couldwater.\r\n\r\nThe course and distance of this day was West 4 Miles the Wind from N. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 20, 1804]\r\nSunday 20th May\r\na Cloudy morning rained and a hard wind last night I continue to write\r\nRolls, Send 20 men to Church to day one man Sick Capt Lewis and Several\r\nGentlemen arrive from St Louis thro a violent Shoure of rain, the most\r\nof the party go to the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 20, 1804]\r\nSunday 20th May\r\nA Cloudy morning rained and hard wind from the ____ last night, The\r\nletter George lost yesterday found by a Country man, I gave the party\r\nleave to go and hear a Sermon to day delivered by Mr. ____ a romon\r\nCarthlick Priest at 3 oClock Capt.

This is the third instance in which this instrument has\r\nstopt in a similar manner since she nas been in my possession, tho the\r\nfirst only since our departure from the River Dubois. in the two\r\npreceding cases when she was again set in motion, and her rate of going\r\ndetermined by a series of equal altitudes of the sun taken for that\r\npurpose, it was found to be the same precisely as that mentioned in the\r\npreliminary remarks to these observations, or 15 s & 5 tenths too slow\r\nin 24 h-as her rate of going after stoping, and begin again set in\r\nmotion has in two instances proved to be the same, I have concluded,\r\nthat whatever this impediment may procede from, it is not caused by any\r\nmaterial injury which her works have sustained, and that when she is in\r\nmotion, her error on mean time above stated, may be depended on as\r\naccurate. In consequence of the chronometer's having thus accedentally\r\nstoped, I determined to come too at the first convenient place and make\r\nsuch observations as were necessary to ascertain her error, establish\r\nthe Latitude & Longitude, and determine the variation of the nedle, in\r\norder to fix a second point of departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 16, 1804]\r\nJuly 16 1804 Monday\r\nSet out verry early and proceeded on the Side of a Prarie passd the\r\nhead of the Island opsd. which we Camped last night, (1) passed a Small\r\nwillow Island off the L. point, hills make near the river (2) passed a\r\nlarge Island nearest the L.

This being a good\r\nSituation and much nearer the Otteaus town than the Mouth of the Platt,\r\nwe concluded to delay at this place a fiew days and Send for Some of\r\nthe Chiefs of that nation to let them Know of the Change of Government,\r\nThe wishes of our Government to Cultivate friendship with them, the\r\nObjects of our journy and to present them with a flag and Some Small\r\npresents\r\n\r\nSome of our Provisions in the French Perogue being wet it became\r\nnecessary to Dry them a fiew days--Wind hard from N W. five Deer Killed\r\nto day--The river rise a little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 22, 1804]\r\nJuly 22nd 1804.\r\nA summary discription of the apparatus employed in the following\r\nobservations; containing also some remarks on the manner in which they\r\nhave been employed, and the method observed in recording the\r\nobservations made with them.\r\n\r\n1st--a brass Sextant of 10 Inches radius, graduated to 15 which by the\r\nassistance of the nonius was devisible to 15\"; and half of this sum by\r\nmeans of the micrometer could readily be distinguished, therefore-7.5\"\r\nof an angle was perceptible with this instrument; she was also\r\nfurnished with three eye-pieces, consisting of a hollow tube and two\r\ntelescopes one of which last reversed the images of observed objects.\r\nfinding on experiment that the reversing telescope when employed as the\r\neye-piece gave me a more full and perfect image than either of the\r\nothers, I have most generally imployed it in all the observations made\r\nwith this instrument; when thus prepared I found from a series of\r\nobservations that the quantity of her index error was 8' 45\"-; this sum\r\nis therefore considered as the standing error of the instrument unless\r\notherwise expressly mentioned. the altitudes of all objects, observed\r\nas well with this instrument as with the Octant were by means of a\r\nreflecting surface; and those stated to have been taken with the\r\nsextant are the degrees, minutes, &c shewn by the graduated limb of the\r\ninstrument at the time of observation and are of course the double\r\naltitudes of the objects observed.\r\n\r\n2ed--A common Octant of 14 Inches radius, graduated to 20', which by\r\nmeans of the nonius was devisbile to 1', half of this sum, or 30\" was\r\nperceptible by means of a micrometer. this instrument was prepared for\r\nboth the fore and back observation; her error in the fore observation\r\nis 2°+, & and in the back observtion 2° r 1' 40.3\" + at the time of our\r\ndeparture from the River Dubois untill the present moment, the sun's\r\naltitude at noon has been too great to be reached with my sextant, for\r\nthis purpose I have therefore employed the Octant by the back\r\nobservation. the degrees ' & \", recorded for the sun's altitude by the\r\nback observation express only the angle given by the graduated limb of\r\nthe instrument at the time of observation, and are the complyment of\r\nthe double Altitude of the sun's observed limb; if therefore the angle\r\nrecorded be taken from 180° the remainder will be the double altitude of\r\nthe observed object, or that which would be given by the fore\r\nobservation with a reflecting surface.\r\n\r\n3rd--An Artificial Horizon on the construction recommended and\r\npracticed by Mr. Andrw. Ellicott of Lancaster, Pensyla., in which water\r\nis used as the reflecting surface; believing this artificial Horizon\r\nliable to less error than any other in my possession, I have uniformly\r\nused it when the object observed was sufficiently bright to reflect a\r\ndistinct immage; but as much light is lost by reflection from water I\r\nfound it inconvenient in most cases to take the altitude of the moon\r\nwith this horizon, and that of a star impracticable with any degree of\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\n4th--An Artificial Horizon constructed in the manner recommended by Mr.\r\nPatterson of Philadelphia; glass is here used as the reflecting\r\nsurface. this horizon consists of a glass plane with a single\r\nreflecting surface, cemented to the flat side of the larger segment of\r\na wooden ball; adjusted by means of a sperit-level and a triangular\r\nstand with a triangular mortice cut through it's center sufficiently\r\nlarge to admit of the wooden ball partially; the stand rests on three\r\nscrews inserted near it's angles, which serve as feet for it to rest on\r\nwhile they assist also in the adjustment. this horizon I have employed\r\nin taking the altitude of the sun when his image he has been reather\r\ntoo dull for a perfect reflection from water; I have used it generally\r\nin taking the altitude of the moon, and in some cases of the stars\r\nalso; it gives the moon's image very perfectly, and when carefully\r\nadjusted I consider it as liable to but little error.\r\n\r\n5th--An Artificial Horizon formed of the index specula of a Sextant\r\ncemented to a flat board; adjusted by means of a sperit level and the\r\ntriangular stand before discribed. as this glass reflects from both\r\nsurfaces it gives the images of all objects much more bright than\r\neither of the other horizons; I have therefore most generally employed\r\nit in observing the altitudes of stars\r\n\r\n6th--A Chronometer; her ballance-wheel and escapement were on the most\r\nimproved construction. she rested on her back, in a small case prepared\r\nfor her, suspended by an universal joint. she was carefully wound up\r\nevery day at twelve oclock. Her rate of going as asscertained by a\r\nseries of observations made by myself for that purpose was found to be\r\n15 Seconds and a 5 tenths of a second too slow in twenty four howers on\r\nMean Solar time. This is nearly the same result as that found by Mr.\r\nAndrew Ellicott who was so obliging as to examine her rate of going for\r\nthe space of fourteen days, in the summer 1803. her rate of going as\r\nascertained by that gentleman was 15.6 s too slow M. T. in 24 h. and\r\nthat she went from 3 to 4 s. slower the last 12 h, than she did the\r\nfirst 12 h. after being wound up.\r\n\r\nat 12 OCk. on the 14th day of may 1804 (being the day on which the\r\ndetachment left the mouth of the River Dubois) the Chronometer was too\r\nfast M. T. 6 m. 32 s. & 2/10.--This time-piece was regulated on\r\nmeantime, and the time entered in the following observations is that\r\nshewn by her at the place of observation. the day is recconed on Civil\r\ntime, (i e) commencing at midnight.\r\n\r\n7th--A Circumferentor, circle 6 Inches diameter, on the common\r\nconstruction; by means of this instrument adjusted with the sperit\r\nlevel, I have taken the magnetic azimuth of the sun and pole Star. It\r\nhas also been employed in taking the traverse of the river:--from the\r\ncourses thus obtained, together with the distances estimated from point\r\nto point, the chart of the Missouri has been formed which now\r\naccompanys these observations. the several points of observation are\r\nmarked with a cross of red ink, and numbered in such manner as to\r\ncorrespond with the celestial observations made at those points\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 23, 1804]\r\nCamp 10 Ms. above the river Plate Monday July the 23rd\r\na fair morning--Sent out a party of 5 men to look to timber for Ores\r\ntwo other parties to hunt at 11 oClock Sent, G.

Capt Lewis went on an\r\nIsland above our Camp, this Island is abt. one mile long, with a Great\r\npurpotion ceder timber near the middle of it\r\n\r\nI gave out a flannel Shirt to each man, & powder to those who had\r\nexpended thers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, September 17, 1804]\r\nMonday September 17th 1804.\r\nHaving for many days past confined myself to the boat, I determined to\r\ndevote this day to amuse myself on shore with my gun and view the\r\ninterior of the country lying between the river and the Corvus Creek-\r\naccordingly before sunrise I set out with six of my best hunters, two\r\nof whom I dispatched to the lower side of Corvus creek, two with orders\r\nto hunt the bottoms and woodland on the river, while I retained two\r\nothers to acompany me in the intermediate country. one quarter of a\r\nmile in rear of our camp which was situated in a fine open grove of\r\ncotton wood passed a grove of plumb trees loaded with fruit and now\r\nripe. observed but little difference between this fruit and that of a\r\nsimilar kind common to the Atlantic States. the trees are smaller and\r\nmore thickly set. this forrest of plumb trees garnish a plain about 20\r\nfeet more lelivated than that on which we were encamped; this plain\r\nextends back about a mile to the foot of the hills one mile distant and\r\nto which it is gradually ascending this plane extends with the same\r\nbredth from the creek below to the distance of near three miles above\r\nparrallel with the river, and is intirely occupyed by the burrows of\r\nthe barking squril hertefore discribed; this anamal appears here in\r\ninfinite numbers, and the shortness and virdue of grass gave the plain\r\nthe appearance throughout it's whole extent of beatifull bowlinggreen\r\nin fine order. it's aspect is S. E. a great number of wolves of the\r\nsmall kind, balks and some pole-cats were to be seen. I presume that\r\nthose anamals feed on this squirril.--found the country in every\r\ndirection for about three miles intersected with deep reveries and\r\nsteep irregular hills of 100 to 200 feet high; at the tops of these\r\nhills the country breakes of as usual into a fine leavel plain\r\nextending as far as the eye can reach. from this plane I had an\r\nextensive view of the river below, and the irregular hills which border\r\nthe opposite sides of the river and creek. the surrounding country had\r\nbeen birnt about a month before and young grass had now sprung up to\r\nhight of 4 Inches presenting the live green of the spring. to the West\r\na high range of hills, strech across the country from N. to S and\r\nappeared distant about 20 miles; they are not very extensive as I could\r\nplainly observe their rise and termination no rock appeared on them and\r\nthe sides were covered with virdue similar to that of the plains this\r\nsenery already rich pleasing and beatiful, was still farther hightened\r\nby immence herds of Buffaloe deer Elk and Antelopes which we saw in\r\nevery direction feeding on the hills and plains. I do not think I\r\nexagerate when I estimate the number of Buffaloe which could be\r\ncompreed at one view to amount to 3000. my object was if possible to\r\nkill a female Antelope having already procured a male; I pursued my\r\nrout on this plain to the west flanked by my two hunters untill eight\r\nin the morning when I made the signal for them to come to me which they\r\ndid shortly after. we rested our selves about half an hour, and\r\nregailed ourselves on half a bisquit each and some jirk of Elk which we\r\nhad taken the precaution to put in our pouches in the morning before we\r\nset out, and drank of the water of a small pool which had collected on\r\nthis plain from the rains which had fallen some days before. We had now\r\nafter various windings in pursuit of several herds of antelopes which\r\nwe had seen on our way made the distance of about eight miles from our\r\ncamp. we found the Antelope extreemly shye and watchfull insomuch that\r\nwe had been unable to get a shot at them; when at rest they generally\r\nseelect the most elivated point in the neighbourhood, and as they are\r\nwatchfull and extreemly quick of sight and their sense of smelling very\r\naccute it is almost impossible to approach them within gunshot; in\r\nshort they will frequently discover and flee from you at the distance\r\nof three miles. I had this day an opportunity of witnessing the agility\r\nand superior fleetness of this anamal which was to me really\r\nastonishing. I had pursued and twice surprised a small herd of seven,\r\nin the first instance they did not discover me distinctly and therefore\r\ndid not run at full speed, tho they took care before they rested to\r\ngain an elivated point where it was impossible to approach them under\r\ncover except in one direction and that happened to be in the direction\r\nfrom which the wind blew towards them; bad as the chance to approach\r\nthem was, I made the best of my way towards them, frequently peeping\r\nover the ridge with which I took care to conceal myself from their view\r\nthe male, of which there was but one, frequently incircled the summit\r\nof the hill on which the females stood in a group, as if to look out\r\nfor the approach of danger. I got within about 200 paces of them when\r\nthey smelt me and fled; I gained the top of the eminece on which they\r\nstood, as soon as possible from whence I had an extensive view of the\r\ncountry the antilopes which had disappeared in a steep revesne now\r\nappeared at the distance of about three miles on the side of a ridge\r\nwhich passed obliquely across me and extended about four miles. so soon\r\nhad these antelopes gained the distance at which they had again\r\nappeared to my view I doubted at ferst that they were the same that I\r\nhad just surprised, but my doubts soon vanished when I beheld the\r\nrapidity of their flight along the ridge before me it appeared reather\r\nthe rappid flight of birds than the motion of quadrupeds. I think I can\r\nsafely venture the asscertion that the speed of this anamal is equal if\r\nnot superior to that of the finest blooded courser.--this morning I saws\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, September 17, 1804]\r\n17th of Septr.

The ice which incloses them lyes in several\r\nstratas of unequal thicknesses which are seperated by streams of water.\r\nthis peculiarly unfortunate because so soon as we cut through the first\r\nstrata of ice the water rushes up and rises as high as the upper\r\nsurface of the ice and thus creates such a debth of water as renders it\r\nimpracticable to cut away the lower strata which appears firmly\r\nattatched to, and confining the bottom of the vessels. the instruments\r\nwe have hitherto used has been the ax only, with which, we have made\r\nseveral attempts that proved unsuccessful) from the cause above\r\nmentioned. we then determined to attempt freeing them from the ice by\r\nmeans of boiling water which we purposed heating in the vessels by\r\nmeans of hot stones, but this expedient proved also fruitless, as every\r\nspecies of stone which we could procure in the neighbourhood partook so\r\nmuch of the calcarious genus that they burst into small particles on\r\nbeing exposed to the heat of the fire. we now determined as the dernier\r\nresort to prepare a parse) of Iron spikes and attatch them to the end\r\nof small poles of convenient length and endeavour by means of them to\r\nfree the vessels from the ice. we have already prepared a large rope of\r\nElk-skin and a windless by means of which we have no doubt of being\r\nable to draw the boat on the bank provided we can free from the ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 3, 1805]\r\n3rd of February 1805 our provisions of meat being nearly exorsted I\r\nconcluded to Decend the River on the Ice & hunt, I Set out with about\r\n16 men 3 horses & 2 Slays Descended nearly 60 miles Killed & loaded the\r\nhorses back, & made 2 pens which we filed with meat, & returned on the\r\n13th we Killed 40 Deer, 3 Bulls 19 Elk, maney So meager that they were\r\nunfit for use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 4, 1805]\r\n4th February, Monday 1805.\r\nThis morning fair tho could the thermometer stood at 18° below Naught,\r\nwind from N. W. Capt Clark set out with a hunting party consisting of\r\nsixteen of our command and two frenchmen who together with two others,\r\nhave established a small hut and resided this winter within the\r\nvicinity of Fort Mandane under our protection. visited by many of the\r\nnatives today. our stock of meat which we had procured in the Months of\r\nNovember & December is now nearly exhausted; a supply of this articles\r\nis at this moment peculiarly interesting as well for our immediate\r\nconsumption, as that we may have time before the approach of the warm\r\nseason to prepare the meat for our voyage in the spring of the year.\r\nCapt. Clark therefore deturmined to continue his rout down the river\r\neven as far as the River bullet unless he should find a plenty of game\r\nnearer--The men transported their baggage on a couple of small wooden\r\nSlays drawn by themselves, and took with them 3 pack horses which we\r\nhad agreed should be returned with a load of meat to fort mandane as\r\nsoon as they could procure it. no buffaloe have made their appearance\r\nin our neighbourhood for some weeks; and I am informed that our Indian\r\nneighbours-suffer extreemly at this moment for the article of flesh.\r\nShields killed two deer this evening, both very lean--one a large buck,\r\nhe had shed his horns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 5, 1805]\r\n5th February Tuesday 1805.\r\nPleasent morning wind from N. W. fair; visited by many of the natives\r\nwho brought a considerable quanty of corn in payment for the work which\r\nthe blacksmith had done for them--they are pecuarly attatched to a\r\nbattle ax formed in a very inconvenient manner in my opinion. it is\r\nfabricated of iron only, the blade is extreemly thin, from 7 to nine\r\ninches in length and from 43/4, to 6 Inches on it's edge, from whence\r\nthe sides proceed nearly in a straight line to the eye where it's width\r\nis generally not more than an inch. The eye is round & about one inch\r\nin diameter. the handle seldom more than fourteen inches in length, the\r\nwhole weighing about one pound--the great length of the blade of this\r\nax, added to the small size of the handle renders a stroke uncertain\r\nand easily avoided, while the shortness of the handel must render a\r\nblow much less forceable if even well directed, and still more\r\ninconvenient as they uniformly use this instrument in action on\r\nhorseback. The oalder fassion is still more inconvenient, it is\r\nsomewhat in the form of the blade of an Espantoon but is attatchd to a\r\nhelve of the dementions before discribed the blade is sometimes by way\r\nof ornament purforated with two three or more small circular holes--the\r\nfollowing is the general figure it is from 12 to 15 inces in length\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 6, 1805]\r\n6th February Wednesday 1805.\r\nFair morning Wind from N. W. had a sley prepared against the return of\r\nthe horses which Capt Clark had promised to send back as soon as he\r\nshould be able to procure a load of meat. visited by many of the\r\nnatives among others the Big white, the Coal, big-man, hairy horn and\r\nthe black man, I smoked with them, after which they retired, a\r\ndeportment not common, for they usually pester us with their good\r\ncompany the ballance of the day after once being introduced to our\r\napartment. Shields killed three antelopes this evening. the blacksmiths\r\ntake a considerable quantity of corn today in payment for their labour.\r\nthe blacksmith's have proved a happy resoce to us in our present\r\nsituation as I believe it would have been difficult to have devised any\r\nother method to have procured corn from the natives. the Indians are\r\nextravegantly fond of sheet iron of which they form arrow-points and\r\nmanufacter into instruments for scraping and dressing their buffaloe\r\nrobes--I permited the blacksmith to dispose of a part of a sheet-iron\r\ncallaboos which had been nearly birnt out on our passage up the river,\r\nand for each piece about four inches square he obtained from seven to\r\neight gallons of corn from the natives who appeared extreemly pleased\r\nwith the exchange-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 7, 1805]\r\n7th February Thursday 1805.\r\nThis morning was fair Thermometer at 18° above naught much warmer than it\r\nhas been for some days; wind S. E. continue to be visited by the\r\nnatives. The Sergt. of the guard reported that the Indian women (wives\r\nto our interpreters) were in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any\r\ntime of night and admitting their Indian visitors, I therefore directed\r\na lock to be put to the gate and ordered that no Indian but those\r\nattatched to the garrison should be permitted to remain all night\r\nwithin the fort or admitted during the period which the gate had been\r\npreviously ordered to be kept shut which was from sunset untill sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 8, 1805]\r\n8th February Friday 1805.\r\nThis morning was fair wind S. E. the weather still warm and pleasent-\r\nvisited by the black-Cat the principal chief of the Roop-tar-he, or\r\nupper mandane vilage. this man possesses more integrety, firmness,\r\ninteligence and perspicuety of mind than any indian I have met with in\r\nthis quarter, and I think with a little management he may be made a\r\nusefull agent in furthering the views of our government. The black Cat\r\npresented me with a bow and apologized for not having completed the\r\nshield he had promised alledging that the weather had been too could to\r\npermit his making it, I gave him som small shot 6 fishing-hooks and 2\r\nyards of ribbon his squaw also presented me with 2 pair of mockersons\r\nfor which in return I gave a small lookingglass and a couples of\r\nnedles. the chief dined with me and left me in the evening. he informed\r\nme that his people suffered very much for the article of meat, and that\r\nhe had not himself tasted any for several days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 9, 1805]\r\n9th February Saturday 1805.\r\nThe morning fair and pleasent, wind from S. E.--visted by Mr. McKinzey\r\none the N. W. Company's clerks. this evening a man by the name of\r\nHoward whom I had given permission to go the Mandane vilage returned\r\nafter the gate was shut and rether than call to the guard to have it\r\nopened scaled the works an indian who was looking on shortly after\r\nfollowed his example. I convinced the Indian of the impropryety of his\r\nconduct, and explained to him the riske he had run of being severely\r\ntreated, the fellow appeared much allarmed, I gave him a small piece of\r\ntobacco and sent him away Howard I had comitted to the care of the\r\nguard with a determineation to have him tryed by a Courtmartial for\r\nthis offence. this man is an old soldier which still hightens this\r\noffnce-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 10, 1805]\r\n10th February Sunday 1805.\r\nThis Morning was Cloudy after a slight snow which fell in the course of\r\nthe night the wind blue very hard from N. W. altho the thermometer\r\nstood at 18° Above naught the violence of the wind caused a degree of\r\ncould that was much more unpleasent than that of yesterday when\r\nthermometer stood at 10° only above the same point. Mr. McKinzey left me\r\nthis morning. Charbono returned with one of the Frenchmen and informed\r\nthat he had left the three Horses and two men with the meat which Capt.\r\nClark had sent at some distance below on the river--he told me that the\r\nhorses were heavy loaded and that not being shod it was impossible for\r\nhorses to travel on the ice. I determined to send down some men with\r\ntwo small slays for the meat and accordingly I gave orders that they\r\nshould set out early the next morning. two men were also sent to\r\nconduct the horses by way of the plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 11, 1805]\r\n11th February Monday 1805.\r\nThe party that were ordered last evening set out early this morning.\r\nthe weather was fair and could wind N. W. about five oclock this\r\nevening one of the wives of Charbono was delivered of a fine boy. it is\r\nworthy of remark that this was the first child which this woman had\r\nboarn and as is common in such cases her labour was tedious and the\r\npain violent; Mr. Jessome informed me that he had freequently\r\nadminstered a small portion of the rattle of the rattle-snake, which he\r\nassured me had never failed to produce the desired effect, that of\r\nhastening the birth of the child; having the rattle of a snake by me I\r\ngave it to him and he administered two rings of it to the woman broken\r\nin small pieces with the fingers and added to a small quantity of\r\nwater. Whether this medicine was truly the cause or not I shall not\r\nundertake to determine, but I was informed that she had not taken it\r\nmore than ten minutes before she brought forth perhaps this remedy may\r\nbe worthy of future experiments, but I must confess that I want faith\r\nas to it's efficacy.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 12, 1805]\r\n12th February Tuesday 1805.\r\nThe morning was fair tho could, thermometer at 14° below naught wind S.\r\nE. ordered the Blacksmith to shoe the horses and some others to prepare\r\nsome gears in order to send them down with three slays to join the\r\nhunting party and transport the meat which they may have pocured to\r\nthis place--the the men whom I had sent for the meat left by Charbono\r\ndid not return untill 4 OClock this evening. Drewyer arrived with the\r\nhorses about the same time, the horses appeared much fatieged I\r\ndirected some meal brands given them moisened with a little water but\r\nto my astonishment found that they would not eat it but prefered the\r\nbark of the cotton wood which forms the principall article of food\r\nusually given them by their Indian masters in the winter season; for\r\nthis purpose they cause the trees to be felled by their women and the\r\nhorses feed on the boughs and bark of their tender branches. the\r\nIndians in our neighbourhood are freequently pilfered of their horses\r\nby the Recares, Souixs and Assinniboins and therefore make it an\r\ninvariable rule to put their horses in their lodges at night. in this\r\nsituation the only food of the horse consists of a few sticks of the\r\ncottonwood from the size of a man's finger to that of his arm. The\r\nIndians are invariably severe riders, and frequently have occasion for\r\nmany days together through the whole course of the day to employ their\r\nhorses in pursuing the Buffaloe or transporting meat to their vilages\r\nduring which time they are seldom suffered to tast food; at night the\r\nHorse returned to his stall where his food is what seems to me a scanty\r\nallowance of wood. under these circumstances it would seem that their\r\nhorses could not long exist or at least could not retain their flesh\r\nand strength, but the contrary is the fact, this valuable anamall under\r\nall those disadvantages is seldom seen meager or unfit for service.--A\r\nlittle after dark this evening Capt. Clark arrived with the hunting\r\nparty--since they set out they have killed forty Deer, three buffaloe\r\nbulls, & sixteen Elk, most of them were so meager that they were unfit\r\nfor uce, particularly the Buffaloes and male Elk--the wolves also which\r\nare here extreemly numerous heped themselves to a considerable\r\nproportion of the hunt--if an anamal is killed and lyes only one night\r\nexposed to the wolves it is almost invariably devoured by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 13, 1805]\r\n13th February Wednesday 1805.\r\nThe morning cloudy thermometer 2° below naught wind from S.

You then provide an earthen pot of\r\nconvenient size say of three gallons which will stand the fire; a\r\nplatter also of the same materials sufficiently small to be admitted in\r\nthe mouth of the pot or jar. the pot has a nitch in it's edge through\r\nwhich to watch the beads when in blast. You then provide some well\r\nseasoned clay with a propertion of sand sufficient to prevent it's\r\nbecoming very hard when exposed to the heat. this clay must be tempered\r\nwith water untill it is about the consistency of common doe. of this\r\nclay you then prepare, a sufficient number of little sticks of the size\r\nyou wish the hole through the bead, which you do by roling the clay on\r\nthe palm of the hand with your finger. this done put those sticks of\r\nclay on the platter and espose them to a red heat for a few minutes\r\nwhen you take them off and suffer them to cool. the pot is also heated\r\nto cles it perfectly of any filth it may contain. small balls of clay\r\nare also mad of about an ounce weight which serve each as a pedestal\r\nfor a bead. these while soft ar distributed over the face of the\r\nplatter at such distance from each other as to prevent the beads from\r\ntouching. some little wooden paddles are now provided from three to\r\nfour inches in length sharpened or brought to a point at the extremity\r\nof the handle. with this paddle you place in the palm of the hand as\r\nmuch of the wet pounded glass as is necessary to make the bead of the\r\nsize you wish it. it is then arranged with the paddle in an oblong\r\nform, laying one of those little stick of clay crosswise over it; the\r\npounded glass by means of the paddle is then roped in cilindrical form\r\narround the stick of clay and gently roled by motion of the hand\r\nbackwards an forwards until you get it as regular and smooth as you\r\nconveniently can. if you wish to introduce any other colour you now\r\npurforate the surface of the bead with the pointed end of your little\r\npaddle and fill up the cavity with other pounded glass of the colour\r\nyou wish forming the whole as regular as you can. a hole is now made in\r\nthe center of the little pedestals of clay with the handle of your\r\nshovel sufficiently large to admit the end of the stick of clay arround\r\nwhich the bead is formed. the beads are then arranged perpindicularly\r\non their pedestals and little distance above them supported by the\r\nlittle sticks of clay to which they are attatched in the manner before\r\nmentioned. Thus arranged the platter is deposited on burning coals or\r\nhot embers and the pot reversed with the apparture in it's edge turned\r\ntowards coverd the whole. dry wood pretty much doated _; is then plased\r\narron the pot in sush manner as compleatly to cover it is then set on\r\nfire and the opperator must shortly after begin to watch his beads\r\nthrough the apparture of the pot lest they should be distroyed by being\r\nover heated. he suffers the beads to acquire a deep red heat from which\r\nwhen it passes in a small degree to a pailer or whitish red, or he\r\ndiscovers that the beads begin to become pointed at their upper\r\nextremities he removes the fire from about the pot and suffers the\r\nwhole to cool gradually. the pot is then removed and the beads taken\r\nout. the clay which fills the hollow of the beads is picked out with an\r\nawl or nedle, the bead is then fit for uce. The Indians are extreemly\r\nfond of the large beads formed by this process. they use them as\r\npendants to their years, or hair and sometimes wear them about their\r\nnecks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 16, 1805]\r\n16th of March Satturday 1805\r\na Cloudy day wind from the S.

Louis, a small canoe with two French hunters\r\naccompanyed the barge; these men had assended the missouri with us the\r\nlast year as engages. The barge crew consisted of six soldiers and two\r\n____ Frenchmen; two Frenchmen and a Ricara Indian also take their\r\npassage in her as far as the Ricara Vilages, at which place we expect\r\nMr. Tiebeau to embark with his peltry who in that case will make an\r\naddition of two, perhaps four men to the crew of the barge. We gave\r\nRichard Warfington, a discharged Corpl., the charge of the Barge and\r\ncrew, and confided to his care likewise our dispatches to the\r\ngovernment, letters to our private friends, and a number of articles to\r\nthe President of the United States. One of the Frenchmen by the Name of\r\nGravline an honest discrete man and an excellent boat-man is imployed\r\nto conduct the barge as a pilot; we have therefore every hope that the\r\nbarge and with her our dispatches will arrive safe at St. Louis. Mr.\r\nGravlin who speaks the Ricara language extreemly well, has been\r\nimployed to conduct a few of the Recara Chiefs to the seat of\r\ngovernment who have promised us to decend in the barge to St. Liwis\r\nwith that view.-\r\n\r\nAt same moment that the Barge departed from Fort Mandan, Capt. Clark\r\nembaked with our party and proceeded up the river. as I had used no\r\nexercise for several weeks, I determined to walk on shore as far as our\r\nencampment of this evening; accordingly I continued my walk on the N.\r\nside of the River about six miles, to the upper Village of the Mandans,\r\nand called on the Black Cat or Pose cop'se ha, the great chief of the\r\nMandans; he was not at home; I rested myself a minutes, and finding\r\nthat the party had not arrived I returned about 2 miles and joined them\r\nat their encampment on the N. side of the river opposite the lower\r\nMandan village. Our party now consisted of the following Individuals.\r\nSergts. John Ordway, Nathaniel Prior, & Patric Gass; Privates, William\r\nBratton, John Colter, Reubin, and Joseph Fields, John Shields, George\r\nGibson, George Shannon, John Potts, John Collins, Joseph Whitehouse,\r\nRichard Windsor, Alexander Willard, Hugh Hall, Silas Goodrich, Robert\r\nFrazier, Peter Crouzatt, John Baptiest la Page, Francis Labiech, Hue\r\nMcNeal, William Werner, Thomas P.

Clark, an Indian Woman wife to\r\nCharbono with a young child, and a Mandan man who had promised us to\r\naccompany us as far as the Snake Indians with a view to bring about a\r\ngood understanding and friendly intercourse between that nation and his\r\nown, the Minetares and Ahwahharways.\r\n\r\nOur vessels consisted of six small canoes, and two large perogues. This\r\nlittle fleet altho not quite so rispectable as those of Columbus or\r\nCapt. Cook were still viewed by us with as much pleasure as those\r\ndeservedly famed adventurers ever beheld theirs; and I dare say with\r\nquite as much anxiety for their safety and preservation. we were now\r\nabout to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width, on\r\nwhich the foot of civillized man had never trodden; the good or evil it\r\nhad in store for us was for experiment yet to determine, and these\r\nlittle vessells contained every article by which we were to expect to\r\nsubsist or defend ourselves. however as this the state of mind in which\r\nwe are, generally gives the colouring to events, when the immagination\r\nis suffered to wander into futurity, the picture which now presented\r\nitself to me was a most pleasing one. entertaing as I do, the most\r\nconfident hope of succeading in a voyage which had formed a darling\r\nproject of mine for the last ten years, I could but esteem this moment\r\nof my departure as among the most happy of my life. The party are in\r\nexcellent health and sperits, zealously attatched to the enterprise,\r\nand anxious to proceed; not a whisper of murmur or discontent to be\r\nheard among them, but all act in unison, and with the most perfect\r\nharmony. I took an early supper this evening and went to bed. Capt.\r\nClark myself the two Interpretters and the woman and child sleep in a\r\ntent of dressed skins. this tent is in the Indian stile, formed of a\r\nnumber of dressed Buffaloe skins sewed together with sinues. it is cut\r\nin such manner that when foalded double it forms the quarter of a\r\ncircle, and is left open at one side where it may be attatched or\r\nloosened at pleasure by strings which are sewed to its sides to the\r\npurpose. to erect this tent, a parsel of ten or twelve poles are\r\nprovided, fore or five of which are attatched together at one end, they\r\nare then elivated and their lower extremities are spread in a circular\r\nmanner to a width proportionate to the demention of the lodge, in the\r\nsame position orther poles are leant against those, and the leather is\r\nthen thrown over them forming a conic figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 7, 1805]\r\n7th of April Satturday 1805\"\r\na windey day, The Interpreter we Sent to the Villages returned with\r\nChief of the Ricara's & 3 men of that nation this Chief informed us\r\nthat he was Sent by his nation to Know the despositions of the nations\r\nin this neighbourhood in respect to the recara's Settleing near them,\r\nthat he had not yet made those arrangements, he request that we would\r\nSpeek to the Assinniboins, & Crow Inds. in their favour, that they\r\nwished to follow our directions and be at peace with all, he viewed all\r\nnations in this quarter well disposed except the Sioux.

Capt\r\nClark returned foud she had filled with water and all her loading wet.\r\nwe lost half a bag of hisquit, and about thirty pounds of powder by\r\nthis accedent; the powder we regard as a serious loss, but we spread it\r\nto dry immediately and hope we shall still be enabled to restore the\r\ngreater part of it. this was the only powder we had which was not\r\nperfectly secure from geting wet. we took dinner at this place, and\r\nthen proceed on to oure encampment, which was on the S. side opposite\r\nto a high bluff. the Mandan man came up after we had encamped and\r\nbrought with him a woman who was extreemly solicitous to accompany one\r\nof the men of our party, this however we positively refused to permit.\r\n\r\nFrom the upper point on an island (being the point to which Capt. Clark\r\ntook his last course when he assended the river in surch of a place for\r\nwinter quarters 1st November last) to a point of wood land Stard side,\r\npassing a high bluff on the Lard.

W. proceeded on passed\r\nall the villages the inhabitents of which flocked down in great numbers\r\nto view us, I took my leave of the great Chief of the Mandans who gave\r\nme a par of excellent mockersons, one Canoe filed with water every\r\nthing in her got wet. 2/3 of a barrel of powder lost by this accedent.\r\n\r\nCamped on the S. S. opsd. a high bluff an Indian joined us, also an\r\nIndian woman with a view to accompany us, the woman was Sent back the\r\nman being acquainted with the Countrey we allowed him to accompanie ns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 9, 1805]\r\nTuesday April 9th\r\nSet out as early as it was possible to see this morning and proceed\r\nabout five miles where we halted and took beakfas--the Indian man who\r\nhad promised us to accompany us as far as the Snake Indians, now\r\ninformed us of his intention to relinquish the journey, and accordingly\r\nreturned to his village. we saw a great number of brant passing up the\r\nriver, some of them were white, except the large feathers in the first\r\nand second joint of the wing which are black. there is no other\r\ndifference between them and the common gray brant but that of their\r\ncolour--their note and habits are the same, and they are freequently\r\nseen to associate together. I have not yet positively determined\r\nwhether they are the same, or a different species.--Capt Clark walked\r\non shore to-day and informed me on his return, that passing through the\r\nprarie he had seen an anamal that precisely resembled the burrowing\r\nsqurril, accept in point of size, it being only about one third as\r\nlarge as the squirrel, and that it also burrows. I have observed in\r\nmany parts of the plains and praries the work of an anamal of which I\r\ncould never obtain a view. their work resembles that of the salamander\r\ncommon to the sand hills of the States of South Carolina and Georgia;\r\nand like that anamal also it never appears above the ground. the little\r\nhillocks which are thrown up by these anamals have much the appearance\r\nof ten or twelve pounds of loose earth poared out of a vessel on the\r\nsurface of the plain. in the state they leave them you can discover no\r\nwhole through which they throw out this earth; but by removing the\r\nloose earth gently you may discover that the soil has been broken in a\r\ncircle manner for about an inch and a half in diameter, where it\r\nappears looser than the adjacent surface, and is certainly the place\r\nthrough which the earth has been thrown out, tho the operation is\r\nperformed without leaving any visible aperture.--the Bluffs of the\r\nriver which we passed today were upwards of a hundred feet high, formed\r\nof a mixture of yellow clay and sand--many horizontal stratas of\r\ncarbonated wood, having every appearance of pitcoal at a distance; were\r\nseen in the the face of these bluffs. these stratas are of unequal\r\nthicknesses from I to 5 feet, and appear at different elivations above\r\nthe water some of them as much as eighty feet. the hills of the river\r\nare very broken and many of them have the apearance of having been on\r\nfire at some former period. considerable quantities of pumice stone and\r\nlava appear in many parts of these hills where they are broken and\r\nwashed down by the rain and melting snow. when we halted for dinner the\r\nsquaw busied herself in serching for the wild artichokes which the mice\r\ncollect and deposit in large hoards. this operation she performed by\r\npenetrating the earth with a sharp stick about some small collections\r\nof drift wood. her labour soon proved successful, and she procurrd a\r\ngood quantity of these roots. the flavor of this root resembles that of\r\nthe Jerusalem Artichoke, and the stalk of the weed which produces it is\r\nalso similar, tho both the root and stalk are much smaller than the\r\nJarusalem Artichoke. the root is white and of an ovate form, from one\r\nto three inches in length and usually about the size of a man's finger.\r\none stalk produces from two to four, and somitimes six of these roots.\r\n\r\nat the distance of 6 miles passed a large wintering or hunting camp of\r\nthe Minetares on the Stard. side. these lodges about thirty in number\r\nare built of earth and timber in their usual stile. 21/4 miles higher\r\nwe passed the entrance of Miry Creek, which discharges itself on the\r\nStard. side. this creek is but small, takes it's rise in some small\r\nlakes near the Mouse river and passes in it's course to the Missouri,\r\nthrough beatifull, level, and fertile plains, intirely destitute of\r\ntimber.--Three miles above the mouth of this creek we passed a hunting\r\ncamp of Minetares who had prepared a park and were wating the return of\r\nthe Antelope; which usually pass the Missouri at this season of the\r\nyear from the Black hills on the South side, to the open plains on the\r\nnorth side of the river; in like manner the Antelope repasses the\r\nMissouri from N. to South in the latter end of Autumn, and winter in\r\nthe black hills, where there is considerable bodies of woodland. we\r\nproceed on 111/2 miles further and encamped on the N. side in a most\r\nbeatifull high extensive open bottom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 9, 1805]\r\n9th of April Tuesday 1805.\r\nSet out this morning verry early under a gentle breeze from the S. E.\r\nat Brackfast the Indian deturmined to return to his nation. I saw a\r\nMusquetor to day great numbers of Brant flying up the river, the Maple,\r\n& Elm has buded & Cotton and arrow wood beginning to bud. I saw in the\r\nprarie an animal resembling the Prarie dog or Barking Squirel & burrow\r\nin the Same way, this animal was about 1/3 as large as the barking\r\nSquirel. But fiew resident birds or water fowls which I have Seen as\r\nyet at 6 miles passed an old hunting camp of Menitarrees on the S. S.\r\n21/2 miles higher passed the mouth of Miry Creek on the S.

S. waiting the return of the\r\nAntilope, Saw Great numbers of Gees feedin in the Praries on the young\r\ngrass, I saw flowers in the praries to day, juniper grows on the Sides\r\nof the hills, & runs on the ground all the hills have more or Less\r\nindefferent Coal in Stratias at different bites from the waters edge to\r\n80 feet. those Stratias from 1 inch to 5 feet thick. we Campd. on the\r\nS. S. above some rocks makeing out in the river in a butifull ellivated\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 10, 1805]\r\nWednesday April 10th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour this morning at the distance of three miles\r\npassed some Minetares who had assembled themselves on the Lard shore to\r\ntake a view of our little fleet. Capt Clark walked on shore today, for\r\nseveral hours, when he returned he informed me that he had seen a gang\r\nof Antelopes in the plains but was unable to get a shoot at them he\r\nalso saw some geese and swan. the geese are now feeding in considerable\r\nnumbers on the young grass which has sprung up in the bottom prariesthe\r\nMusquetoes were very troublesome to us today. The country on both sides\r\nof the missouri from the tops of the river hills, is one continued\r\nlevel fertile plain as far as the eye can reach, in which there is not\r\neven a solitary tree or shrub to be seen except such as from their\r\nmoist situations or the steep declivities of hills are sheltered from\r\nthe ravages of the fire. at the distance of 12 miles from our\r\nencampment of last night we arrived at the lower point of a bluff on\r\nthe Lard side; about 11/2 miles down this bluff from this point, the\r\nbluff is now on fire and throws out considerable quantities of smoke\r\nwhich has a strong sulphurious smell. the appearance of the coal in the\r\nblufs continues as yesterday. at 1 P.M. we overtook three french\r\nhunters who had set out a few days before us with a view of traping\r\nbeaver; they had taken 12 since they left Fort Mandan. these people\r\navail themselves of the protection which our numbers will enable us to\r\ngive them against the Assinniboins who sometimes hunt on the Missouri\r\nand intend ascending with us as far as the mouth of the Yellow stone\r\nriver and continue there hunt up that river. this is the first essay of\r\na beaver hunter of any discription on this river. the beaver these\r\npeople have already taken is by far the best I have ever seen. the\r\nriver bottoms we have passed to-day are wider and possess more timber\r\nthan usualthe courant of the Missouri is but moderate, at least not\r\ngreater than that of the Ohio in high tide; it's banks are falling in\r\nbut little; the navigation is therefore comparitively with it's lower\r\nportion easy and safe.--we encamped this evening on a willow point,\r\nStard. side just above a remarkable bend in the river to the S. W.\r\nwhich we called the little bason.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 10, 1805]\r\n10th of April Wednesday 1805\r\nSet out verry early. the morning cool and no wind proceeded on passed a\r\ncamp of Inds. on the L.

S. with\r\nhorses and dogs loaded going down, those are a part of the Menetarras\r\nwho camped a little above this with the Ossinniboins at the mouth of\r\nthe little Missouri all the latter part of the winter we Camped on the\r\nS. S. below a falling in bank. the river raise a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 12, 1805]\r\nFriday April the 12th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour. our peroge and the Canoes passed over to the\r\nLard side in order to avoid a bank which was rappidly falling in on the\r\nStard. the red perogue contrary to my expectation or wish passed under\r\nthis bank by means of her toe line where I expected to have seen her\r\ncarried under every instant. I did not discover that she was about to\r\nmake this attempt untill it was too late for the men to reembark, and\r\nretreating is more dangerous than proceeding in such cases; they\r\ntherefore continued their passage up this bank, and much to my\r\nsatisfaction arrived safe above it. this cost me some moments of\r\nuneasiness, her cargo was of much importance to us in our present\r\nadvanced situation--We proceeded on six miles and came too on the lower\r\nside of the entrance of the little Missouri on the Lard shore in a fine\r\nplain where we determined to spend the day for the purpose of celestial\r\nobservation. we sent out 10 hunters to procure some fresh meat. at this\r\nplace made the following observations.-\r\n\r\nThe night proved so cloudy that I could make no further observations.\r\nGeorge Drewyer shot a Beaver this morning, which we found swiming in\r\nthe river a small distance below the entrance of the little Missouri.\r\nthe beaver being seen in the day, is a proof that they have been but\r\nlittle hunted, as they always keep themselves closly concealed during\r\nthe day where they are so.--found a great quantity of small onions in\r\nthe plain where we encamped; had some of them collected and cooked,\r\nfound them agreeable. the bulb grows single, is of an oval form, white,\r\nand about the size of a small bullet; the leaf resembles that of the\r\nshive, and the hunters returned this eying with one deer only. the\r\ncountry about the mouth of this river had been recently hunted by the\r\nMinetares, and the little game which they had not killed and frightened\r\naway, was so extreemly shy that the hunters could not get in shoot of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe little Missouri disembogues on the S. side of the Missouri 1693\r\nmiles from the confluence of the latter with the Mississippi. it is 134\r\nyards wide at it's mouth, and sets in with a bould current but it's\r\ngreatest debth is not more than 21/2 feet. it's navigation is extreemly\r\ndifficult, owing to it's rapidity, shoals and sand bars. it may however\r\nbe navigated with small canoes a considerable distance. this river\r\npasses through the Northern extremity of the black hills where it is\r\nvery narrow and rapid and it's banks high an perpendicular. it takes\r\nit's rise in a broken country West of the Black hills with the waters\r\nof the yellow stone river, and a considerable distance S. W. of the\r\npoint at which it passes the black hills. the country through which it\r\npasses is generally broken and the highlands possess but little timber.\r\nthere is some timber in it's bottom lands, which consists of Cottonwood\r\nred Elm, with a small proportion of small Ash and box alder. the under\r\nbrush is willow, red wood, (sometimes called red or swamp willow-) the\r\nred burry, and Choke cherry the country is extreamly broken about the\r\nmouth of this river, and as far up on both sides, as we could observe\r\nit from the tops of some elivated hills, which stand betwen these two\r\nrivers, about 3 miles from their junction. the soil appears fertile and\r\ndeep, it consists generally of a dark rich loam intermixed with a small\r\nproportion of fine sand. this river in it's course passed near the N.\r\nW. side of the turtle mountain, which is said to be no more than 4 or 5\r\nleagues distant from it's entrance in a straight direction, a little to\r\nthe S. of West.--this mountain and the knife river have therefore been\r\nlaid down too far S. W. the colour of the water, the bed of the river,\r\nand it's appearance in every respect, resembles the Missouri; I am\r\ntherefore induced to believe that the texture of the soil of the\r\ncountry in which it takes it's rise, and that through which it passes,\r\nis similar to the country through which the Missouri passes after\r\nleaving the woody country, or such as we are now in.--on the side of a\r\nhill not distant from our camp I found some of the dwarf cedar of which\r\nI preserved a specimen (See No. 2). this plant spreads it's limbs\r\nalonge the surface of the earth, where they are sometimes covered, and\r\nalways put forth a number of roots on the under side, while on the\r\nupper there are a great number of small shoots which with their leaves\r\nseldom rise higher than 6 or eight inches. they grow so close as\r\nperfectly to conceal the eath. it is an evergreen; the leaf is much\r\nmore delicate than the common Cedar, and it's taste and smell the same.\r\nI have often thought that this plant would make very handsome edgings\r\nto the borders and walks of a garden; it is quite as handsom as box,\r\nand would be much more easily propegated.--the appearance of the\r\nglauber salts and Carbonated wood still continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 12, 1805]\r\n12th April Friday 1805\r\na fine morning Set out verry early, the murcery Stood 56° above 0.\r\nproceeded on to the mouth of the Little Missouri river and formed a\r\nCamp in a butifull elivated plain on the lower Side for the purpose of\r\ntakeing Some observations to fix the Latitude & Longitude of this\r\nriver. this river falls in on the L. Side and is 134 yards wide and 2\r\nfeet 6 Inches deep at the mouth, it takes its rise in the N W extremity\r\nof the black mountains, and through a broken countrey in its whole\r\ncourse washing the N W base of the Turtle Mountain which is Situated\r\nabout 6 Leagues S W of its mouth, one of our men Baptiest who came down\r\nthis river in a canoe informs me that it is not navagable, he was 45\r\ndays descending.\r\n\r\nOne of our men Shot a beaver Swimming below the mouth of this river.\r\n\r\nI walked out on the lower Side of this river and found the countrey\r\nhilley the Soil composed of black mole & a Small perportion of Sand\r\ncontaining great quantity of Small peable Some limestone, black flint,\r\n& Sand Stone I killed a Hare Changeing its Colour Some parts retaining\r\nits long white fur & other parts assumeing the Short grey, I Saw the\r\nMagpie in pars, flocks of Grouse, the old field lark & Crows, &\r\nobserved the leaf of the wild Chery half grown, many flowers are to be\r\nseen in the plains, remains of Minetarra & Ossinneboin hunting Camps\r\nare to be Seen on each Side of the two Missouris\r\n\r\nThe wind blew verry hard from the S. all the after part of the day, at\r\n3 oClock P M. it became violent & flowey accompanied with thunder and a\r\nlittle rain. We examined our canoes &c found Several mice which had\r\nalready commenced cutting our bags of corn & parched meal, the water of\r\nthe little Missouri is of the Same texture Colour & quallity of that of\r\nthe Big Missouri the after part of the day so Cloudy that we lost the\r\nevening observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 13, 1805]\r\nSaturday April 13th\r\nBeing disappointed in my observations of yesterday for Longitude, I was\r\nunwilling to remain at the entrance of the river another day for that\r\npurpose, and therefore determined to set out early this morning; which\r\nwe did accordingly; the wind was in our favour after 9 A.M. and\r\ncontinued favourable untill three 3 P.M. we therefore hoisted both the\r\nsails in the White Perogue, consisting of a small squar sail, and\r\nspritsail, which carried her at a pretty good gate, untill about 2 in\r\nthe afternoon when a suddon squall of wind struck us and turned the\r\nperogue so much on the side as to allarm Sharbono who was steering at\r\nthe time, in this state of alarm he threw the perogue with her side to\r\nthe wind, when the spritsail gibing was as near overseting the perogue\r\nas it was possible to have missed. the wind however abating for an\r\ninstant I ordered Drewyer to the helm and the sails to be taken in,\r\nwhich was instant executed and the perogue being steered before the\r\nwind was agin placed in a state of security. this accedent was very\r\nnear costing us dearly. beleiving this vessell to be the most steady\r\nand safe, we had embarked on board of it our instruments, Papers,\r\nmedicine and the most valuable part of the merchandize which we had\r\nstill in reserve as presents for the Indians. we had also embarked on\r\nboard ourselves, with three men who could not swim and the squaw with\r\nthe young child, all of whom, had the perogue overset, would most\r\nprobably have perished, as the waves were high, and the perogue upwards\r\nof 200 yards from the nearest shore; however we fortunately escaped and\r\npursued our journey under the square sail, which shortly after the\r\naccident I directed to be again hoisted. our party caught three beaver\r\nlast evening; and the French hunters 7. as there was much appearance of\r\nbeaver just above the entrance of the little Missouri these hunters\r\nconcluded to remain some days; we therefore left them without the\r\nexpectation of seeing them again.--just above the entrance of the\r\nLittle Missouri the great Missouri is upwards of a mile in width, tho\r\nimmediately at the entrance of the former it is not more than 200 yards\r\nwide and so shallow that the canoes passed it with seting poles. at the\r\ndistance of nine miles passed the mouth of a creek on the Stard. side\r\nwhich we called onion creek from the quantity of wild onions which grow\r\nin the plains on it's borders. Capt. Clark who was on shore informed me\r\nthat this creek was 16 yards wide a mile & a half above it's entrance,\r\ndischarges more water than creeks of it's size usually do in this open\r\ncountry, and that there was not a stick of timber of any discription to\r\nbe seen on it's borders, or the level plain country through which it\r\npasses. at the distance of 10 miles further we passed the mouth of a\r\nlarge creek; discharging itself in the center of a deep bend. of this\r\ncreek and the neighbouring country, Capt Clark who was on shore gave me\r\nthe following discription \"This creek I took to be a small river from\r\nit's size, and the quantity of water which it discharged. I ascended it\r\n11/2 miles, and found it the discharge of a pond or small lake, which\r\nhad the appearance of having formerly been the bed of the Missouri.\r\nseveral small streems discharge themselves into this lake. the country\r\non both sides consists of beautifull level and elivated plains;\r\nasscending as they recede from the Missouri; there were a great number\r\nof Swan and gees in this lake and near it's borders I saw the remains\r\nof 43 temperary Indian lodges, which I presume were those of the\r\nAssinniboins who are now in the neighbourhood of the British\r\nestablishments on the Assinniboin river-\" This lake and it's discharge\r\nwe call Boos Egg from the circumstance of Capt Clark shooting a goose\r\nwhile on her nest in the top of a lofty cotton wood tree, from which we\r\nafterwards took one egg. the wild gees frequently build their nests in\r\nthis manner, at least we have already found several in trees, nor have\r\nwe as yet seen any on the ground, or sand bars where I had supposed\r\nfrom previous information that they most commonly deposited their eggs.-\r\n saw some Bufhaloe and Elk at a distance today but killed none of them.\r\nwe found a number of carcases of the Buffaloe lying along shore, which\r\nhad been drowned by falling through the ice in winter and lodged on\r\nshore by the high water when the river broke up about the first of this\r\nmonth. we saw also many tracks of the white bear of enormous size,\r\nalong the river shore and about the carcases of the Buffaloe, on which\r\nI presume they feed. we have not as yet seen one of these anamals, tho\r\ntheir tracks are so abundant and recent. the men as well as ourselves\r\nare anxious to meet with some of these bear. the Indians give a very\r\nformidable account of the strengh and ferocity of this anamal, which\r\nthey never dare to attack but in parties of six eight or ten persons;\r\nand are even then frequently defeated with the loss of one or more of\r\ntheir party. the savages attack this anamal with their bows and arrows\r\nand the indifferent guns with which the traders furnish them, with\r\nthese they shoot with such uncertainty and at so short a distance, that\r\nthey frequently mis their aim & fall a sacrefice to the bear. two\r\nMinetaries were killed during the last winter in an attack on a white\r\nbear. this anamall is said more frequently to attack a man on meeting\r\nwith him, than to flee from him. When the Indians are about to go in\r\nquest of the white bear, previous to their departure, they paint\r\nthemselves and perform all those superstitious rights commonly observed\r\nwhen they are about to make war uppon a neighbouring nation.

Clark walked on shore this morning, and on his return informed me\r\nthat he had passed through the timbered bottoms on the N. side of the\r\nriver, and had extended his walk several miles back on the hills; in\r\nthe bottom lands he had met with several uninhabited Indian lodges\r\nbuilt with the boughs of the Elm, and in the plains he met with the\r\nremains of two large encampments of a recent date, which from the\r\nappearance of some hoops of small kegs, seen near them we concluded\r\nthat they must have been the camps of the Assinniboins, as no other\r\nnation who visit this part of the missouri ever indulge themselves with\r\nspirituous liquor. of this article the Assinniboins are pationately\r\nfond, and we are informed that it forms their principal inducement to\r\nfurnish the British establishments on the Assinniboin river with the\r\ndryed and pounded meat and grease which they do. they also supply those\r\nestablishments with a small quantity of fur, consisting principally of\r\nthe large and small wolves and the small fox skins. these they barter\r\nfor small kegs of ruin which they generally transport to their camps at\r\na distance from the establishments, where they revel with their friends\r\nand relations as long as they possess the means of intoxication, their\r\nwomen and children are equally indulged on those occations and are all\r\nseen drunk together. so far is a state of intoxication from being a\r\ncause of reproach among them, that with the men, it is a matter of\r\nexultation that their skill and industry as hunters has enabled them to\r\nget drunk frequently. in their customs, habits, and dispositions these\r\npeople very much resemble the Siouxs from whom they have descended. The\r\nprincipal inducement with the British fur companies, for continuing\r\ntheir establishments on the Assinniboin river, is the Buffaloe meat and\r\ngrease they procure from the Assinniboins, and Christanoes, by means of\r\nwhich, they are enabled to supply provision to their engages on their\r\nreturn from rainy Lake to the English river and the Athabaskey country\r\nwhere they winter; without such resource those voyagers would\r\nfrequently be straitened for provision, as the country through which\r\nthey pass is but scantily supplyed with game, and the rappidity with\r\nwhich they are compelled to travel in order to reach their winter\r\nstations, would leave therm but little leasure to surch for food while\r\non their voyage.\r\n\r\nThe Assinniboins have so recently left this neighbourhood, that the\r\ngame is scarce and very shy. the river continues wide, and not more\r\nrapid than the Ohio in an averge state of it's current. the bottoms are\r\nwide and low, the moister parts containing some timber; the upland is\r\nextreemly broken, chonsisting of high gaulded nobs as far as the eye\r\ncan reach on ether side, and entirely destitute of timber. on these\r\nhills many aromatic herbs are seen; resembling in taste, smel and\r\nappearance, the sage, hysop, wormwood, southernwood and two other herbs\r\nwhich are strangers to me; the one resembling the camphor in taste and\r\nsmell, rising to the hight of 2 or 3 feet; the other about the same\r\nsize, has a long, narrow, smooth, soft leaf of an agreeable smel and\r\nflavor; of this last the Atelope is very fond; they feed on it, and\r\nperfume the hair of their foreheads and necks with it by rubing against\r\nit. the dwarf cedar and juniper is also found in great abundance on the\r\nsides of these hills. where the land is level, it is uniformly fertile\r\nconsisting of a dark loam intermixed with a proportion of fine sand. it\r\nis generally covered with a short grass resembling very much the blue\r\ngrass.--the miniral appearances still continue; considerable quantities\r\nof bitumenous water, about the colour of strong lye trickles down the\r\nsides of the hills; this water partakes of the taste of glauber salts\r\nand slightly of allumn.--while the party halted to take dinner today\r\nCapt Clark killed a buffaloe bull; it was meagre, and we therefore took\r\nthe marrow bones and a small proportion of the meat only. near the\r\nplace we dined on the Lard. side, there was a large village of\r\nburrowing squirrels. I have remarked that these anamals generally\r\ncelect a South Easterly exposure for their residence, tho they are\r\nsometimes found in the level plains.--passed an Island, above which two\r\nsmall creeks fall in on Lard side; the upper creek largest, which we\r\ncalled Sharbono's Creek after our interpreter who encamped several\r\nweeks on it with a hunting party of Indians. this was the highest point\r\nto which any whiteman had ever ascended; except two Frenchmen who\r\nhaving lost their way had straggled a few miles further, tho to what\r\nplace precisely I could not learn.--I walked on shore above this creek\r\nand killed an Elk, which was so poor that it was unfit for uce; I\r\ntherefore left it, and joined the party at their encampment on the\r\nStard shore a little after dark. on my arrival Capt Clark informed me\r\nthat he had seen two white bear pass over the hills shortly after I\r\nfired, and that they appeared to run nearly from the place where I\r\nshot. the lard. shore on which I walked was very broken, and the hills\r\nin many places had the appearance of having sliped down in masses of\r\nseveral acres of land in surface.--we saw many gees feeding on the\r\ntender grass in the praries and several of their nests in the trees; we\r\nhave not in a single instance found the nest of this bird on or near\r\nthe ground. we saw a number of Magpies their nests and eggs. their\r\nnests are built in trees and composed of small sticks leaves and grass,\r\nopen at top, and much in the stile of the large blackbird comm to the U\r\nStates. the egg is of a bluish brown colour, freckled with redish brown\r\nspots. one of the party killed a large hooting owl. I observed no\r\ndifference between this burd and those of the same family common to the\r\nU States, except that this appeared to be more booted and more thickly\r\nclad with feathers.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 14, 1805]\r\n14th of April Sunday 1805.\r\na fine morning, a dog came to us this morning we Suppose him to be left\r\nby the Inds. who had their camps near the Lake we passd. yesterday not\r\nlong Sence, I observed Several Single Lodges built of Stiks of cotten\r\ntimber in different parts of the bottoms. in my walk of this day which\r\nwas through the wooded bottoms and on the hills for several miles back\r\nfrom the river on the S. S. I Saw the remains of two Indian incampments\r\nwith wide beeten tracks leading to them. those were no doubt the Camps\r\nof the Ossinnaboin Indians (a Strong evidence is hoops of Small Kegs\r\nwere found in the incampments) no other nation on the river above the\r\nSioux make use of Spiritious licquer, the Ossinniboins is said to be\r\npasionately fond of Licquer, and is the principal inducement to their\r\nputting themselves to the trouble of Catching the fiew wolves and foxes\r\nwhich they furnish, and recive their liquor always in small Kegs. The\r\nOssinniboins make use of the Same kind of Lodges which the Sioux and\r\nother Indians on this river make use of--Those lodges or tents are made\r\nof a number of dressed buffalow Skins Sowed together with Sinues &\r\ndeckerated with the tales, & Porcupine quils, when open it forms a half\r\ncircle with a part about 4 Inches wide projecting about 8 or 9 Inches\r\nfrom the center of the Streight Side for the purpose of attaching it to\r\na pole to it the hight they wish to raise the tent, when they errect\r\nthis tent four poles of equal length are tied near one end, those poles\r\nare elevated and 8 10 or 12 other poles are anexed forming a Circle at\r\nthe ground and lodging in the forks of the four attached poles, the\r\ntents are then raised, by attach the projecting part to a pole and\r\nincumpassing the poles with the tent by bringing the two ends together\r\nand attached with a Cord, or laied as high as is necessary, leaveing\r\nthe lower part open for about 4 feet for to pass in & out, and the top\r\nis generally left open to admit the Smoke to pass--The Borders of the\r\nriver has been So much hunted by those Indians who must have left it\r\nabout 8 or 10 days past and I prosume are now in the neighbourhood of\r\nBritish establishments on the Osinniboin; the game is Scerce and verry\r\nwild. The River Continues wide and the current jentle not more rapid\r\nthan the Current of the Ohio in middle State--The bottoms are wide and\r\nlow and the moist parts of them Contain Som wood such as cotton Elm &\r\nSmall ash, willow rose bushes &c. &c. &. next to the hills Great\r\nquantity of wild Isoop, the hills are high broken in every direction,\r\nand the mineral appearance of Salts Continue to appear in a greater\r\nperportion, also Sulpher, Coal & bitumous water in a Smaller quantity,\r\nI have observed but five burnt hills, about the little Missouri, and I\r\nhave not Seen any pumey stone above that River I Saw Buffalow on the L.\r\nS. Crossed and dureing the time of dinner killed a Bull, which was\r\npore, we made use of the best of it, I Saw a village of Burrowing dogs\r\non the L. S. passed a Island above which two Small Creeks falls in on\r\nthe L. S. the upper of which is the largest and we call Shabonas Creek\r\nafter our interpreter who incamped several weeks on this Creek and is\r\nthe highest point on the Missouri to which a white man has been\r\nprevious to this time. Capt. Lewis walked out above this creek and\r\nkilled an Elk which he found So meager that it was not fit for use, and\r\njoined the boat at Dusk at our Camp on the S. S. opposit a high hill\r\nSeveral parts of which had Sliped down. on the Side of those hills we\r\nSaw two white bear running from the report of Capt. Lewis Shot, those\r\nanimals assended those Steep hills with Supprising ease & verlocity.\r\nthey were too far to discover their prosise Colour & Size--Saw Several\r\ngees nests on trees, also the nests & egs of the Magpies, a large grey\r\nowl killed, booted & with ears &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 15, 1805]\r\nMonday April 15th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour this morning. I walked on shore, and Capt.\r\nClark continued with the party it being an invariable rule with us not\r\nto be both absent from our vessels at the same time. I passed through\r\nthe bottoms of the river on the Stard. side. they were partially\r\ncovered with timber & were extensive, level and beatifull. in my walk\r\nwhich was about 6 miles I passed a small rivulet of clear water making\r\ndown from the hills, which on tasting, I discovered to be in a small\r\ndegree brackish. it possessed less of the glauber salt, or alumn, than\r\nthose little streams from the hills usually do.--in a little pond of\r\nwater fromed by this rivulet where it entered the bottom, I heard the\r\nfrogs crying for the first time this season; their note was the same\r\nwith that of the small frogs which are common to the lagoons and swamps\r\nof the U States.--I saw great quantities of gees feeding in the\r\nbottoms, of which I shot one. saw some deer and Elk, but they were\r\nremarkably shy. I also met with great numbers of Grouse or prarie hens\r\nas they are called by the English traders of the N. W. these birds\r\nappeared to be mating; the note of the male is kuck, kuck, kuck, coo,\r\ncoo, coo. the first part of the note both male and female use when\r\nflying. the male also dubbs something like the pheasant, but by no\r\nmeans as loud. after breakfast Capt. Clark walked on the Std. shore,\r\nand on his return in the evening gave me the following account of his\r\nramble. \"I ascended to the high country, about 9 miles distant from the\r\nMissouri. the country consists of beatifull, level and fertile plains,\r\ndestitute of timber I saw many little dranes, which took their rise in\r\nthe river hills, from whence as far as I could see they run to the N.\r\nE.\" these streams we suppose to be the waters of Mous river a branch of\r\nthe Assinniboin which the Indians informed us approaches the Missouri\r\nvery nearly, about this point. \"I passed,\" continued he, \"a Creek about\r\n20 yards wide,\" which falls into the Missouri; the bottoms of this\r\ncreek are wide level and extreemly fertile, but almost entirely\r\ndestitute of timber. the water of this creek as well as all those\r\ncreeks and rivulets which we have passed since we left Fort Mandan was\r\nso strongly impregnated with salts and other miniral substances that I\r\nwas incapable of drinking it. I saw the remains of several camps of the\r\nAssinniboins; near one of which, in a small ravene, there was a park\r\nwhich they had formed of timber and brush, for the purpose of taking\r\nthe Cabrie or Antelope. it was constructed in the following manner. a\r\nstrong pound was first made of timbers, on one side of which there was\r\na small apparture, sufficiently large to admit an Antelope; from each\r\nside of this apparture, a curtain was extended to a considerable\r\ndistance, widening as they receded from the pound.--we passed a rock\r\nthis evening standing in the middle of the river, and the bed of the\r\nriver was formed principally of gravel. we encamped this evening on a\r\nsand point on Lard. side. a little above our encampment the river was\r\nconfined to a channel of 80 yards in width.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 15, 1805]\r\n15th of April Monday 1805\r\nSet out at an early hour, Captn Lewis walked on Shore and Killed a\r\ngoose, passed a Island in a bend to the L. S. the wind hard from the S.\r\nE. after brackfast I walked on Shore and assended to the high Countrey\r\non the S. S. and off from the Missouri about three miles the countrey\r\nis butifull open fertile plain the dreans take theer rise near the\r\nClifts of the river and run from the river in a N E derection as far as\r\nI could See, this is the part of the River which Mouse river the waters\r\nof Lake Winnipec approaches within a fiew miles of Missouri, and I\r\nbelieve those dreans lead into that river. we passed a creek about 20\r\nyds. wide on the S. S. the bottoms of this Creek is extensive &\r\nfertile, the water of this as also, all the Streams which head a fiew\r\nmiles in the hills discharge water which is black & unfit for use (and\r\ncan Safely Say that I have not Seen one drop of water fit for use above\r\nfort Mandan except Knife and the little Missouris Rivers and the\r\nMissouri, the other Streams being So much impregnated with mineral as\r\nto be verry disagreeble in its present State.) I saw the remains of\r\nSeveral Camps of ossinniboins, near one of those camps & at no great\r\ndistance from the mouth of the aforesid Creek, in a hollow, I saw a\r\nlarge Strong pen made for the purpose of Catching the antelope, with\r\nwings projecting from it widining from the pen\r\n\r\nSaw Several gangs of Buffalow and Some elk at a distance, a black bear\r\nSeen from the Perogues to day--passed a rock in the Middle of the\r\nriver, Some Smaller rocks from that to the L. Shore, the dog that came\r\nto us yesterday morning continues to follow us, we camped on a Sand\r\npoint to the L. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 16, 1805]\r\nTuesday April 16th 1805.\r\nSet out very early this morning. Capt. Clark walked on Shore this\r\nmorning, and killed an Antelope, rejoined us at 1/2 after eight A.M.-\r\nhe informed me that he had seen many Buffaloe Elk and deer in his\r\nabsence, and that he had met with a great number of old hornets nests\r\nin the woody bottoms through which he had passed.--the hills of the\r\nriver still continue extreemly broken for a few miles back, when it\r\nbecomes a fine level country of open fertile lands immediately on the\r\nriver there are many fine leavel extensive and extreemly fertile high\r\nplains and meadows. I think the quantity of timbered land on the river\r\nis increasing. the mineral appearances still continue. I met with\r\nseveral stones today that had the appearance of wood first carbonated\r\nand then petrefyed by the water of the river, which I have discovered\r\nhas that effect on many vegitable substances when exposed to it's\r\ninfluence for a length of time. l believe it to be the stratas of Coal\r\nseen in those hills which causes the fire and birnt appearances\r\nfrequently met with in this quarter. where those birnt appearances are\r\nto be seen in the face of the river bluffs, the coal is seldom seen,\r\nand when you meet with it in the neighbourhood of the stratas of birnt\r\nearth, the coal appears to be presisely at the same hight, and is\r\nnearly of the same thickness, togeter with the sand and a sulphurious\r\nsubstance which ususually accompanys it. there was a remarkable large\r\nbeaver caught by one of the party last night. these anamals are now\r\nvery abundant. I have met with several trees which have been felled by\r\nthem 20 Inches in diameter. bark is their only food; and they appear to\r\nprefer that of the Cotton wood and willow; as we have never met with\r\nany other species of timber on the Missouri which had the appearance of\r\nbeing cut by them.--we passed three small creeks on the Stard. side.\r\nthey take their rise in the river hills at no great distance. we saw a\r\ngreat number of geese today, both in the plains and on the river--I\r\nhave observed but few ducks, those we have met with are the Mallard and\r\nblue winged Teal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 16, 1805]\r\n16th of April Tuesday 1805\r\nWind hard from the S.

Some verry handsom high planes\r\n& extensive bottoms, the mineral appearances of Coal & Salt together\r\nwith Some appearance of Burnt hils continue. a number of old hornets\r\nnests Seen in every bottom more perticularly in the one opposit to the\r\nplace we camped this night--the wooded bottoms are more extensive to\r\nday than Common. passed three Small Creeks on the S. S. to day which\r\ntake their rise in the hills at no great distance, Great numbers of\r\nGees in the river & in the Plains feeding on the Grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 17, 1805]\r\nWednesday April 17th 1805.\r\nA delightfull morning, set out at an erly hour. the country though\r\nwhich we passed to (lay was much the same as that discribed of\r\nyesterday; there wase more appearance of birnt hills, furnishing large\r\nquanties of lava and pumice stone, of the latter some pieces were seen\r\nfloating down the river. Capt. Clark walked on shore this morning on\r\nthe Stard. side, and did not join us untill half after six in the\r\nevening. he informed me that he had seen the remains of the Assinniboin\r\nencampments in every point of woodland through which he had passed. we\r\nsaw immence quantities of game in every direction around us as we\r\npassed up the river; consisting of herds of Buffaloe, Elk, and\r\nAntelopes with some deer and woolves. tho we continue to see many\r\ntracks of the bear we have seen but very few of them, and those are at\r\na great distance generally runing from us; I thefore presume that they\r\nare extreemly wary and shy; the Indian account of them dose not\r\ncorrispond with our experience so far. one black bear passed near the\r\nperogues on the 16th and was seen by myself and the party but he so\r\nquickly disappeared that we did not shoot at him.--at the place we\r\nhalted to dine on the Lard. side we met with a herd of buffaloe of\r\nwhich I killed the fatest as I concieved among them, however on\r\nexamining it I found it so poar that I thought it unfit for uce and\r\nonly took the tongue; the party killed another which was still more\r\nlean. just before we encamped this evening we saw some tracks of\r\nIndians who had passed about 24 hours; they left four rafts of timber\r\non the Stard. side, on which they had passed. we supposed them to have\r\nbeen a party of the Assinniboins who had been to war against the rocky\r\nmountain Indians, and then on their return. Capt. Clark saw a Curlou\r\ntoday. there were three beaver taken this morning by the party. the men\r\nprefer the flesh of this anamal, to that of any other which we have, or\r\nare able to procure at this moment. I eat very heartily of the beaver\r\nmyself, and think it excellent; particularly the tale, and liver. we\r\nhad a fair wind today which enabled us to sail the greater part of the\r\ndistance we have travled, encamped on the Lard shore the extremity of\r\nthe last course\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 17, 1805]\r\n17th of April Wednesday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the S E. Genly to day handsom high extencive\r\nrich Plains on each Side, the mineral appearances continue with greater\r\nappearances of Coal, much greater appearance of the hills haveing been\r\nburnt, more Pumice Stone & Lava washed down to the bottoms and some\r\nPumice Stone floating in the river, I walked on the S. S. Saw great\r\nnumbs. of Buffalow feeding in the Plains at a distance Capt. Lewis\r\nkilled 2 Buffalow buls which was near the water at the time of dineing,\r\nthey were So pore as to be unfit for use. I Saw Several Small parties\r\nof antelopes large herds of Elk, Some white wolves, and in a pond\r\n(formed on the S. S. by the Missouries Changeing its bead) I Saw Swan\r\nGees & different kinds of Ducks in great numbers also a Beaver house.\r\nPassed a Small Creek on the S. S. & Several runs of water on each Side,\r\nSaw the remains of Indian camps in every point of timbered land on the\r\nS. S. in the evining a thunder gust passed from the S W, without rain,\r\nabout Sunset Saw Some fresh Indians track and four rafts on the shore\r\nS. S. Those I prosume were Ossinniboins who had been on a war party\r\nagainst the Rockey Mountain Indians--Saw a Curlow, Some verry large\r\nbeaver taken this morning. those animals are made use of as food and\r\npreferred by the party to any other at this Season\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 18, 1805]\r\nThursday April 18th 1805.\r\nA fine morning, set out at an early hour. one Beaver caught this\r\nmorning by two traps, having a foot in each; the traps belonged to\r\ndifferent individuals, between whom, a contest ensued, which would have\r\nterminated, most probably, in a serious rencounter had not our timely\r\narrival at the place prevented it. after breakfast this morning, Capt.\r\nClark walked on Stad. shore, while the party were assending by means of\r\ntheir toe lines, I walked with them on the bank; found a species of pea\r\nbearing a yellow flower, and now in blume; it seldom rises more than 6\r\ninches high, the leaf & stalk resembles that of the common gardin pea,\r\nthe root is pirenial. (See specimen of vegitables No. 3.) I also saw\r\nseveral parsels of buffaloe's hair hanging on the rose bushes, which\r\nhad been bleached by exposure to the weather and became perfectly\r\nwhite. it every appearance of the wool of the sheep, tho much finer and\r\nmore silkey and soft. I am confident that an excellent cloth may be\r\nmade of the wool of the Buffaloe. the Buffaloe I killed yesterday had\r\ncast his long hare, and the poll which remained was very thick, fine,\r\nand about 2 inches in length. I think this anamal would have furnished\r\nabout five pounds of wool. we were detained today from one to five P.M.\r\nin consequence of the wind which blew so violently from N. that it was\r\nwith difficulty we could keep the canoes from filling with water altho\r\nthey were along shore; I had them secured by placing the perogues on\r\nthe out side of them in such manner as to break the waves off them. at\r\n5 we proceed, and shortly after met with Capt. Clark, who had killed an\r\nElk and a deer and was wating our arrival. we took the meat on board\r\nand continued our march untill nearly dark when we came too on the\r\nStard side under a boald welltimbered bank which sheltered us from the\r\nwind which had abated but not yet ceased. here we encamped, it being\r\nthe extremity of the last course of this day.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 18, 1805]\r\n18th of April Thursday 1805\r\nSet out at an early hour one Beaver & a Musrat Cought this morning, the\r\nbeaver cought in two traps, which like to have brought about a\r\nmissunderstanding between two of the party &c. after brackfast I\r\nassended a hill and observed that the river made a great bend to the\r\nSouth, I concluded to walk thro the point about 2 miles and take\r\nShabono, with me, he had taken a dost of Salts &c. his Squar followed\r\non with his child, when I Struck the next bend of the river could See\r\nnothing of the Party, left this man & his wife & Child on the river\r\nbank and went out to hunt, Killed a young Buck Elk, & a Deer, the Elk\r\nwas tolerable meat, the Deer verry pore, Butcherd the meat and\r\nContinued untill near Sunset before Capt Lewis and the party Came up,\r\nthey were detained by the wind, which rose Soon after I left the boat\r\nfrom the N W. & blew verry hard untill verry late in the evening. we\r\nCamped on the S. S. in an excellent harbor, Soon after We came too, two\r\nmen went up the river to Set their beaver traps they met with a Bear\r\nand being without their arms thought prodent to return &c. the wild\r\nCheries are in bloom, Great appearance of Burnt hills Pumice Stone &c.\r\nthe Coal & Salt appearance Continued, the water in the Small runs much\r\nbetter than below,--Saw Several old Indian Camps, the game, Such as\r\nBuffalow Elk, antelopes & Deer verry plenty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 19, 1805]\r\nFriday April 19th 1805.\r\nThe wind blew So hard this morning from N. W. that we dared not to\r\nventure our canoes on the river.--Observed considerable quantities of\r\ndwarf Juniper on the hillsides (see specimen No. 4) it seldom rises\r\nhigher then 3 feet.--the wind detained us through the couse of this\r\nday, tho we were fortunate in having placed ourselves in a safe\r\nharbour. the party killed one Elk and a beaver today. The beaver of\r\nthis part of the Missouri are larger, fatter, more abundant and better\r\nclad with fur than those of any other part of the country that I have\r\nyet seen; I have remarked also that their fur is much darker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 19, 1805]\r\n19th of April Friday 1805\r\na blustering windey day the wind So hard from the N, W. that we were\r\nfearfull of ventering our Canoes in the river, lay by all day on the S.\r\nSide in a good harber, the Praries appear to green, the cotton trees\r\nbigin to leave, Saw some plumb bushes in full bloom, those were the\r\nplumb bushes which I have Seen for Some time. Killed an Elk an a Beaver\r\nto day--The beaver of this river is much larger than usial, Great deal\r\nof Sign of the large Bear,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 20, 1805]\r\nSaturday April 20th 1805.\r\nThe wind continued to blow tolerably hard this morning but by no means\r\nas violently as it (lid yesterday; we determined to set out and\r\naccordingly departed a little before seven. I walked on shore on the N.\r\nside of the river, and Capt Clark proceeded with the party. the river\r\nbottoms through which I passed about seven miles were fertil and well\r\ncovered with Cottonwood some Box alder, ash and red Elm. the under\r\nbrush, willow, rose bushes Honeysuccle, red willow, goosbury, currant\r\nand servicebury & in the open grounds along the foot of the river hills\r\nimmence quantities of the hisop. in the course of my walk I killed two\r\ndeer, wounded an Elk and a deer; saw the remains of some Indian hunting\r\ncamps, near which stood a small scaffold of about 7 feet high on which\r\nwere deposited two doog slays with their harnis. underneath this\r\nscaffold a human body was lying, well rolled in several dressed\r\nbuffaloe skins and near it a bag of the same materials containg sundry\r\narticles belonging to the disceased; consisting of a pare of\r\nmockersons, some red and blue earth, beaver's nails, instruments for\r\ndressing the Buffalo skin, some dryed roots, several platts of the\r\nsweet grass, and a small quantity of Mandan tobacco.--I presume that\r\nthe body, as well as the bag containing these articles, had formerly\r\nbeen placed on the scaffold as is the custom of these people, but had\r\nfallen down by accedent. near the scaffold I saw the carcase of a large\r\ndog not yet decayed, which I supposed had been killed at the time the\r\nhuman body was left on the scaffold; this was no doubt the reward,\r\nwhich the poor doog had met with for performing the ____-friendly\r\noffice to his mistres of transporting her corps to the place of\r\ndeposit. it is customary with the Assinniboins, Mandans, Minetares &c\r\nwho scaffold their dead, to sacrefice the favorite horses and doggs of\r\ntheir disceased relations, with a view of their being servicable to\r\nthem in the land of sperits. I have never heard of any instances of\r\nhuman sacrefices on those occasions among them.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew so hard that I concluded it was impossible fror the\r\nperogues and canoes to proceed and therefore returned and joined them\r\nabout three in the evening. Capt. Clark informed me that soon after\r\nseting out, a part of the bank of the river fell in near one of the\r\ncanoes and had very nearly filled her with water. that the wind became\r\nso hard and the waves so high that it was with infinite risk he had\r\nbeen able to get as far as his present station. the white perrogue and\r\nseveral of the canoes had shiped water several times but happily our\r\nstores were but little injured; those which were wet we put out to dry\r\nand determined to remain untill the next morning. we sent out four\r\nhunters who soon added 3 Elk 4 gees and 2 deer to our stock of\r\nprovisions. the party caught six beaver today which were large and in\r\nfine order. the Buffaloe, Elk and deer are poor at this season, and of\r\ntours are not very palitable, however our good health and apetites make\r\nup every necessary deficiency, and we eat very heartily of them.-\r\nencamped on Stard side; under a high well timbered bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 20, 1805]\r\n20th of April Satturday 1805\r\nwind a head from the N W. we Set out at 7 oClock proceeded on, Soon\r\nafter we Set out a Bank fell in near one of the Canoes which like to\r\nhave filled her with water, the wind became hard and waves So rought\r\nthat we proceeded with our little Canoes with much risque, our\r\nSituation was Such after Setting out that we were obliged to pass round\r\nthe 1st Point or lay exposed to the blustering winds & waves, in\r\npassing round the Point Several canoes took in water as also our large\r\nPerogue but without injuring our Stores & much I proceeded on to the\r\nupper part of the 1st bend and came too at a butifull Glade on the S.\r\nS., about 1 mile below Capt Lewis who had walked thro the point, left\r\nhis Coat & a Deer on the bank which we took on board,-. a Short\r\ndistance below our Camp I Saw Some rafts on the S. S. near which, an\r\nIndian woman was Scaffeled in the Indian form of Deposing their dead, &\r\nfallen down She was or had been raised about 6 feet inclosed in Several\r\nrobes tightly laced around her, with her dog Slays, her bag of\r\nDifferent coloured earths paint Small bones of animals beaver nales and\r\nSeveral other little trinkets, also a blue jay, her dog was killed and\r\nlay near her. Capt. Lewis joined me Soon after I landed & informed me\r\nhe has walked Several miles higher, & in his walk killed 2 Deer &\r\nwounded an Elk & a Deer, our party Shot in the river four beaver &\r\ncought two, which were verry fat and much admired by the men, after we\r\nlanded they killed 3 Elk 4 Gees & 2 Deer we had Some of our Provisions\r\n& which got a little wet aired, the wind Continued So hard that we were\r\nCompelled to delay all day. Saw Several buffalow lodged in the drift\r\nwood which had been drouned in the winter in passing the river; Saw the\r\nremains of 2 which had lodged on the Side of the bank & eate by the\r\nbears.\r\n\r\nThis morning was verry cold, Some Snow about 2 oClock from flying\r\nclouds, Some frost this morning & the mud at the edge of the water was\r\nfrosed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 21, 1805]\r\nSunday April 21st 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour this morning. Capt Clark walked on shore; the\r\nwind tho a head was not violent. the country through which we passed is\r\nvery simelar in every rispect to that through which we have passed for\r\nseveral days.--We saw immence herds of buffaloe Elk deer & Antelopes.\r\nCapt Clark killed a buffaloe and 4 deer in the course of his walk\r\ntoday; and the party with me killed 3 deer, 2 beaver, and 4 buffaloe\r\ncalves. the latter we found very delicious. I think it equal to any\r\nveal I ever tasted. the Elk now begin to shed their horns. passed one\r\nlarge and two small creeks on the Lard. side, tho neither of them\r\ndischarge any water at present. the wind blew so hard this evening that\r\nwe were obliged to halt several hours. we reached the place of\r\nincampment after dark, which was on the Lard. side a little above White\r\nearth river which discharges itself on the Stard. side. immediately at\r\nthe mouth of this river it is not more than 10 yards wide being choked\r\nup by the mud of the Missouri; tho after leaving the bottom lands of\r\nthis river, or even sooner, it becomes a boald stream of sixty yards\r\nwide and is deep and navigable. the course of this river as far as I\r\ncould see from the top of Cut bluff, was due North. it passes through a\r\nbeatifull level and fertile vally about five miles in width. I think I\r\nsaw about 25 miles up this river, and did not discover one tree or bush\r\nof any discription on it's borders. the vally was covered with Elk and\r\nbuffaloe. saw a great number of gees today as usual, also some swan and\r\nducks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 21, 1805]\r\n21st of April Sunday 1805\r\nSet out early the wind gentle & from the N. W. the river being verry\r\nCrooked, I concluded to walk through the point, the Countrey on either\r\nSide is verry Similar to that we have passed, Saw an emence number of\r\nElk & Buffalow, also Deer Antelopes Geese Ducks & a fiew Swan, the\r\nBuffalow is about Calveing I killed a Buffalow & 4 Deer in my walk to\r\nday, the party killed 2 deer 2 beaver & 4 Buffalow Calves, which was\r\nverry good veele. I Saw old Camps of Indians on the L. Side, we passed\r\n1 large & 2 Small Creeks on the L. Side neither of them discharge any\r\nwater into the river, in the evening the wind became verry hard a head,\r\nwe made Camp at a late hour which was on the L. Side a little above the\r\nmouth of White Earth River which falls in on the Stad Side and is 60\r\nyds. wide, several Mes. up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 22, 1805]\r\nMonday April 22cd 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour this morning; proceeded pretty well untill\r\nbreakfat, when the wind became so hard a head that we proceeded with\r\ndifficulty even with the assistance of our toe lines. the party halted\r\nand Cpt. Clark and myself walked to the white earth river which\r\napproaches the Missouri very near at this place, being about 4 miles\r\nabove it's entrance. we found that it contained more water than streams\r\nof it's size generally do at this season. the water is much clearer\r\nthan that of the Missouri. the banks of the river are steep and not\r\nmore than ten or twelve feet high; the bed seems to be composed of mud\r\naltogether. the salts which have been before mentioned as common on the\r\nMissouri, appears in great quantities along the banks of this river,\r\nwhich are in many places so thickly covered with it that they appear\r\nperfectly white. perhaps it has been from this white appearance of it's\r\nbanks that the river has derived it's name. this river is said to be\r\nnavigable nearly to it's source, which is at no great distance from the\r\nSaskashawan, and I think from it's size the direction which it seems to\r\ntake, and the latitude of it's mouth, that there is very good ground to\r\nbelieve that it extends as far North as latitude 50°.--this stream passes\r\nthrough an open country generally.--the broken hills of the Missouri\r\nabout this place exhibit large irregular and broken masses of rocks and\r\nstones; some of which tho 200 feet above the level of the water seem at\r\nsome former period to have felt it's influence, fo they appear smoth as\r\nif woarn by the agetation of the water. this collection consists of\r\nwhite & grey gannite, a brittle black rock, flint, limestone,\r\nfreestone, some small specimens of an excellent pebble and occasionally\r\nbroken stratas of a stone which appears to be petrefyed wood, it is of\r\na black colour, and makes excellent whetstones. Coal or carbonated wood\r\npumice stone lava and other mineral apearances still continue. the coal\r\nappears to be of better quality; I exposed a specimen of it to the fire\r\nand found that it birnt tolerably well, it afforded but little flame or\r\nsmoke, but produced a hot and lasting fire.--I asscended to the top of\r\nthe cutt bluff this morning, from whence I had a most delightfull view\r\nof the country, the whole of which except the vally formed by the\r\nMissouri is void of timber or underbrush, exposing to the first glance\r\nof the spectator immence herds of Buffaloe, Elk, deer, & Antelopes\r\nfeeding in one common and boundless pasture. we saw a number of bever\r\nfeeding on the bark of the trees alonge the verge of the river, several\r\nof which we shot, found them large and fat. walking on shore this\r\nevening I met with a buffaloe calf which attatched itself to me and\r\ncontinued to follow close at my heels untill I embarked and left it. it\r\nappeared allarmed at my dog which was probably the cause of it's so\r\nreadily attatching itself to me. Capt Clark informed me that he saw a\r\nlarge drove of buffaloe pursued by wolves today, that they at length\r\ncaught a calf which was unable to keep up with the herd. the cows only\r\ndefend their young so long as they are able to keep up with the herd,\r\nand seldom return any distance in surch of them.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 22, 1805]\r\n22nd of April Monday 1805\r\na verry cold morning Some frost, we Set out at an early hour and\r\nproceeded on verry well untill brackfast at which time the wind began\r\nto blow verry hard ahead, and Continued hard all day we proceeded on\r\nwith much dificuelty with the assistance of the toe Ropes. Capt. Lewis\r\n& my Self walked to the ____ River which is near the Missouri four\r\nmiles above its mouth, this river is 60 yards wide and contains a\r\ngreater perportion of water at this time than is Common for Rivers of\r\nits Size it appears navagable as fur as any of the party was, and I am\r\ntold to near its Source in morrasses in the open Plains, it passes (as\r\nfar as we can See which is 6 or 7 Leagus) thro a butifull extinsive\r\nvallie, rich & fertile and at this time Covered with Buffalow, Elk &\r\nantelopes, which may be Seen also in any other direction in this\r\nquarter--this river must take its rise at no great distance Easte of\r\nthe Saskashawan, and no doubt as far N. as Latd. 50°\r\n\r\nSome of the high plains or the broken Revien of the river contains\r\ngreat quantity of Pebble Stones of various Sizes, The Stratum of Coal\r\nis much richer than below, the appearances of Mineral & burnt hills\r\nStill continue the river riseing a little, Saw an emence number of\r\nbeaver feeding on the waters edge & Swiming Killed Several, Capt. Lewis\r\nassended a hill from the top of which he had a most inchanting prospect\r\nof the Countrey around & the meanderings of the two rivers, which is\r\nremarkable Crooked--a buffalow calf which was on the Shore alone\r\nfollowed Cap Lewis Some distance,--I observed a large drove of buffalow\r\nprosued by wolves the wolves cought one of their Calves in my view,\r\nthose animals defend their young as long as they Can keep up with the\r\ndrove\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 23, 1805]\r\nTuesday April 23rd\r\nSet out at an early hour this morning. about nine A.M. the wind arose,\r\nand shortly after became so violent that we were unabled to proceed, in\r\nshort it was with much difficulty and some risk that I was enabled to\r\nget the canoes and perogues into a place of tolerable safety, there\r\nbeing no timber on either side of the river at this place. some of the\r\ncanoes shiped water, and wet several parsels of their lading, which I\r\ndirected to be opened and aired we remained untill five in the evening\r\nwhen the wind abating in some measure, we reloaded, and proceeded.\r\nshortly after we were joined by Capt. Clark who had walked on shore\r\nthis morning, and passing through the bottom lands had fallen on the\r\nriver some miles above, and concluding that the wind had detained us,\r\ncame down the river in surch of us. he had killed three blacktaled, or\r\nmule deer, and a buffaloe Calf, in the course of his ramble. these hard\r\nwinds, being so frequently repeated, become a serious source of\r\ndetention to us.--incamped on the Stard. side.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 23, 1805]\r\n23rd of April 1805\r\na cold morning at about 9 oClock the wind as usial rose from the N W\r\nand continued to blow verry hard untill late in the evening I walked on\r\nShore after brackfast in my walk on the S side passed through extensive\r\nbottoms of timber intersperced with glades & low open plains, I killed\r\n3 mule or black tail Deer, which was in tolerable order, Saw Several\r\nothers, I also killed a Buffalow Calf which was verry fine, I Struck\r\nthe river above the Perogus which had Come too in a bend to the L. S.\r\nto Shelter from the wind which had become violently hard, I joined Capt\r\nLewis in the evening & after the winds falling which was late in the\r\nevening we proceeded on & encamped on the S. S. The winds of this\r\nCountrey which blow with Some violence almost every day, has become a\r\nSerious obstruction in our progression onward, as we Cant move when the\r\nwind is high without great risque, and if there was no risque the winds\r\nis generally a head and often too violent to proceed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 24, 1805]\r\nWednesday April 24th\r\nThe wind blew so hard during the whole of this day, that we were unable\r\nto move. notwithstanding that we were sheltered by high timber from the\r\neffects of the wind, such was it's violence that it caused the waves to\r\nrise in such manner as to wet many articles in the small canoes before\r\nthey could be unloaded. we sent out some hunters who killed 4 deer & 2\r\nElk, and caught some young wolves of the small kind.--Soar eyes is a\r\ncommon complaint among the party. I believe it origenates from the\r\nimmence quantities of sand which is driven by the wind from the\r\nsandbars of the river in such clouds that you are unable to discover\r\nthe opposite bank of the river in many instances. the particles of this\r\nsand are so fine and light that they are easily supported by the air,\r\nand are carried by the wind for many miles, and at a distance\r\nexhibiting every appearance of a collumn of thick smoke. so penitrating\r\nis this sand that we cannot keep any article free from it; in short we\r\nare compelled to eat, drink, and breath it very freely. my pocket\r\nwatch, is out of order, she will run only a few minutes without\r\nstoping. I can discover no radical defect in her works, and must\r\ntherefore attribute it to the sand, with which, she seems plentifully\r\ncharged, notwithstanding her cases are double and tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 24, 1805]\r\n24th of April Wednesday 1805\r\nThe wind rose last night and continued blowing from the N. & N W. and\r\nSometimes with great violence, untill 7 oClock P. M, Several articles\r\nwet in the Perogues by their takeing water &c. as the wind was a head\r\nwe could not move today Sent out hunters, they killed 4 Deer 2 Elk &\r\ncought Some young wolves of the Small kind, The party complain much of\r\nthe Sand in their eyes, the Sand is verry fine and rises in clouds from\r\nthe Points and bars of the river, I may Say that dureing those winds we\r\neat Drink & breeth a prepotion of Sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 25, 1805]\r\nThursday April 25th 1805.\r\nThe wind was more moderate this morning, tho still hard; we set out at\r\nan early hour. the water friezed on the oars this morning as the men\r\nrowed. about 10 oclock A.M. the wind began to blow so violently that we\r\nwere obliged to lye too. my dog had been absent during the last night,\r\nand I was fearfull we had lost him altogether, however, much to my\r\nsatisfaction he joined us at 8 Oclock this morning. The wind had been\r\nso unfavorable to our progress for several days past, and seeing but\r\nlittle prospect of a favourable chang; knowing that the river was\r\ncrooked, from the report of the hunters who were out yesterday, and\r\nbeleiving that we were at no very great distance from the Yellow stone\r\nRiver; I determined, in order as mush as possible to avoid detention,\r\nto proceed by land with a few men to the entrance of that river and\r\nmake the necessary observations to determine it's position, which I\r\nhoped to effect by the time that Capt. Clark could arrive with the\r\nparty; accordingly I set out at 1 t OCk. on the Lard. side, accompanyed\r\nby four men. we proceeded about four miles, when falling in with some\r\nbufaloe I killed a yearling calf, which was in good order; we soon\r\ncooked and made a hearty meal of a part of it, and renewed our march\r\nour rout lay along the foot of the river hills. when we had proceeded\r\nabout four miles, I ascended the hills from whence I had a most\r\npleasing view of the country, perticularly of the wide and fertile\r\nvalues formed by the missouri and the yellowstone rivers, which\r\noccasionally unmasked by the wood on their borders disclose their\r\nmeanderings for many miles in their passage through these delightfull\r\ntracts of country. I could not discover the junction of the rivers\r\nimmediately, they being concealed by the woods, however, sensible that\r\nit could not be distant I determined to encamp on the bank of the\r\nYellow stone river which made it's appearance about 2 miles South of\r\nme. the whol face of the country was covered with herds of Buffaloe,\r\nElk & Antelopes; deer are also abundant, but keep themselves more\r\nconcealed in the woodland. the buffaloe Elk and Antelope are so gentle\r\nthat we pass near them while feeding, without apearing to excite any\r\nalarm among them, and when we attract their attention, they frequently\r\napproach us more nearly to discover what we are, and in some instances\r\npursue us a considerable distance apparenly with that view.--in our way\r\nto the place I had determined to encamp, we met with two large herds of\r\nbuffaloe, of which we killed three cows and a calf. two of the former,\r\nwer but lean, we therefore took their tongues and a part of their\r\nmarrow-bones only. I then proceeded to the place of our encampment with\r\ntwo of the men, taking with us the Calf and marrowbones, while the\r\nother two remained, with orders to dress the cow that was in tolerable\r\norder, and hang the meat out of the reach of the wolves, a precaution\r\nindispensible to it's safe keeping, even for a night. we encamped on\r\nthe bank of the yellowstone river, 2 miles South of it's confluence\r\nwith the Missouri. On rejoining Capt. Clark, the 26th in the evening,\r\nhe informed me, that at 5 P.M. after I left him the wind abated in some\r\nmeasure and he proceeded a few miles further and encamped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 25, 1805]\r\n25th of April Thursday 1805\r\nThe wind was moderate & ahead this morning, we Set out at an early hour\r\nThe morning cold, Some flying Clouds to be Seen, the wind from the N.\r\nice collected on the ores this morning, the wind increased and became\r\nSo violent about 1 oClock we were obliged to lay by our Canoes haveing\r\ntaken in Some water, the Dog which was lost yesterday, joined us this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nfinding that the winds retarded our progression for maney days past,\r\nand no apparance of an alteration, and the river being Crooked that we\r\ncould never have 3 miles fair wind, Capt. Lewis concluded to go by land\r\nas far as the Rochejhone or yellow Stone river, which we expect is at\r\nno great distance by land and make Some Selestial observations to find\r\nthe Situation of its mouth, and by that measure not detain the Perogues\r\nat that place any time for the purpose of makeing those necessary\r\nobservations he took 4 men & proceeded on up the Missouri on the L.\r\nSide, at 5 oClock the wind luled and we proceeded on and incamped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 26, 1805]\r\nFriday April 26th 1805.\r\nThis morning I dispatched Joseph Fields up the yellowstone river with\r\norders to examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the\r\nsame evening; two others were directed to bring in the meat we had\r\nkilled last evening, while I proceeded down the river with one man in\r\norder to take a view of the confluence of this great river with the\r\nMissouri, which we found to be two miles distant on a direct line N. W.\r\nfrom our encampment. the bottom land on the lower side of the\r\nyellowstone river near it's mouth for about one mile in width appears\r\nto be subject to inundation; while that on the opposite side of the\r\nMissouri and the point formed by the junction of these rivers is of the\r\ncommon elivation, say from twelve to 18 feet above the level of the\r\nwater, and of course not liable to be overflown except in extreem high\r\nwater, which dose not appear to be very frequent there is more timber\r\nin the neighbourhood of the junction of these rivers, and on the\r\nMissouri as far below as the White earth river, than there is on any\r\npart of the Missouri above the entrance of the Chyenne river to this\r\nplace. the timber consists principally of Cottonwood, with some small\r\nelm, ash and boxalder. the under growth on the sandbars and verge of\r\nthe river is the small leafed willow; the low bottoms, rose bushes\r\nwhich rise to three or four feet high, the redburry, servicebury, and\r\nthe redwood; the high bottoms are of two discriptions either timbered\r\nor open; the first lies next to the river and it's under brush is the\r\nsame with that of the low timbered bottoms with the addition of the\r\nbroad leafed willow, Goosbury, choke cherry, purple currant; and\r\nhoneysuckle bushis; the open bottoms border on the hills, and are\r\ncovered in many parts by the wild hyssop which rises to the hight of\r\ntwo feet. I observe that the Antelope, Buffaloe Elk and deer feed on\r\nthis herb; the willow of the sandbars also furnish a favorite winter\r\nfood to these anamals as well as the growse, the porcupine, hare, and\r\nrabbit. about 12 Olock I heard the discharge of several guns at the\r\njunction of the rivers, which announced to me the arrival of the paty\r\nwith Capt Clark; I afterwards learnt that they had fired on some\r\nbuffaloe which they met with at that place, and of which they killed a\r\ncow and several Calves; the latter are now fine veal. I dispatched one\r\nof the men to Capt Clark requesting him to send up a canoe to take down\r\nthe meat we had killed and our baggage to his encampmt, which was\r\naccordingly complyed with. after I had completed my observations in the\r\nevening I walked down and joined the party at their encampment on the\r\npoint of land fromed by the junction of the rivers; found them all in\r\ngood health, and much pleased at having arrived at this long wished for\r\nspot, and in order to add in some measure to the general pleasure which\r\nseemed to pervade our little community, we ordered a dram to be issued\r\nto each person; this soon produced the fiddle, and they spent the\r\nevening with much hilarity, singing & dancing, and seemed as perfectly\r\nto forget their past toils, as they appeared regardless of those to\r\ncome. in the evening, the man I had sent up the river this morning\r\nreturned, and reported that he had ascended it about eight miles on a\r\nstreight line; that he found it crooked, meandering from side to side\r\nof the valley formed by it; which is from four to five miles wide. the\r\ncorrent of the river gentle, and it's bed much interrupted and broken\r\nby sandbars; at the distance of five miles he passed a large Island\r\nwell covered with timber, and three miles higher a large creek falls in\r\non the S. E. sides above a high bluff in which there are several\r\nstratas of coal. the country bordering on this river as far as he could\r\npercieve, like that of the Missouri, consisted of open plains. he saw\r\nseveral of the bighorned anamals in the couse of his walk; but they\r\nwere so shy that he could not get a shoot at them; he found a large\r\nhorn of one of these anamals which he brought with him. the bed of the\r\nyellowstone river is entirely composed of sand and mud, not a stone of\r\nany kind to be seen in it near it's entrance. Capt Clark measured these\r\nrivers just above their confluence; found the bed of the Missouri 520\r\nyards wide, the water occupying 330. it's channel deep. the yellowstone\r\nriver including it's sandbar, 858 yds. of which, the water occupyed 297\r\nyards; the depest part 12 feet; it was falling at this time & appeard\r\nto be nearly at it's summer tide.--the Indians inform that the\r\nyellowstone river is navigable for perogues and canoes nearly to it's\r\nsource in the Rocky Mountains, and that in it's course near these\r\nmountains it passes within less than half a day's march of a navigable\r\npart of the Missouri. it's extreem sources are adjacent to those of the\r\nMissouri, river platte, and I think probably with some of the South\r\nbranch of the Columbia river. the first part of its course lies through\r\na mountanous rocky country tho well timbered and in many parts fertile;\r\nthe middle, and much the most extensive portion of the river lies\r\nthrough a delightfull rich and fertile country, well covered with\r\ntimber, intersperced with plains and meadows, and well watered; it is\r\nsome what broken in many parts. the lower portion consists of fertile\r\nopen plains and meadows almost entirely, tho it possesses a\r\nconsiderable proportion of timber on it's borders. the current of the\r\nupper portion is extreemly rappid, that of the middle and lower\r\nportions much more gentle than the Missouri. the water of this river is\r\nturbid, tho dose not possess as much sediment as that of the Missouri.\r\nthis river in it's course recieves the waters of many large tributary\r\nstrains principally from the S. E. of which the most considerable are\r\nthe Tongue and bighorn rivers the former is much the largest, and heads\r\nwith the river Platte and Bighorn river, as dose the latter with the\r\nTongue river and the river Platte.--a suficient quantity of limestone\r\nmay be readily procured for building near the junction of the Missouri\r\nand yellowstone rivers. I could observe no regular stratas of it, tho\r\nit lies on the sides of the river hills in large irregular masses, in\r\nconsiderable quantities; it is of a light colour, and appears to be of\r\nan excellent quality.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 26, 1805]\r\n26th of April Friday 1805\r\nlast night was verry Cold. the Thermometer Stood at 32 abov 0 this\r\nmorning. I Set out at an early hour, as it was cold I walked on the\r\nbank, & in my walk Shot a beaver & 2 Deer, one of the Deer in tolerable\r\norder, the low bottom of the river is generaly Covered with wood\r\nwillows & rose bushes, red berry, wild Cherry & red or arrow wood\r\nintersperced with glades The timber is Cottonwood principally, Elm\r\nSmall ash also furnish a portion of the timber, The Clay of the bluffs\r\nappear much whiter than below, and Contain Several Stratums of Coal, on\r\nthe hill Sides I observe pebbles of different Size & Colour--The river\r\nhas been riseing for Several days, & raised 3 inches last night, at 12\r\noClock arrived at the forks of the Roche Johne & Missouri and formed a\r\nCamp on the point Soon after George Drewyer Came from Capt Lewis &\r\ninformed me that he was a little way up the Roche johne and would join\r\nme this evining, I Sent a canoe up to Capt Lewis and proceeded measure\r\nthe width of the rivers, and find the debth. The Missouri is 520 yards\r\nwide above the point of yellow Stone and the water covers 330 yards;\r\nthe YellowStone River is 858 yards wide includeing its Sand bar, the\r\nwater covers 297 yards and the deepest part is 12 feet water, it is at\r\nthis time falling, the Missouri rising The Indians inform that the\r\nyellow Stone River is navagable for Perogues to near its Source in the\r\nRocky Mountains, it has many tributary Streams, principally on the S.\r\nE. Side, and heads at no great distance from the Missouri, the largest\r\nrivers which fall into it is Tongue river which heads with the waters\r\nof River Platt, and Big horn river which also heads with Platt & Tongue\r\nR the current of this river is Said to be rapid near its mouth it is\r\nverry jentle, and its water is of a whitish colour much Clearer of\r\nSediment than the Missouri. the Countrey on this river is Said to be\r\nbroken in its whole Course & Contains a great deel of wood, the\r\ncountrey about its mouth is verry fine, the bottoms on either Side is\r\nwooded with Cotton wood, ash, Elm &c. near the banks of the river back\r\nis higher bottoms and Covered with red berry, Goose berry & rose bushes\r\n&. interspersed with Small open Glades, and near the high land is\r\nGenerally open rich bottoms--at our arrival at the forks I observed a\r\nDrove of Buffalow Cows & Calves on a Sand bar in the point, I directed\r\nthe men to kill the fattest Cow, and 3 or 4 Calves, which they did and\r\nlet the others pass, the Cows are pore, Calves fine veele.\r\n\r\nCapt Lewis joined me in the evening after takeing equal altitudes a\r\nlittle way up the YellowStone river the Countrey in every direction is\r\nplains except the moist bottoms of the river, which are covered with\r\nSome indifferent timber Such as Cotton wood Elm & Small ash, with\r\ndifferent kind of Stubs & bushes in the forks about 1 mile from the\r\npoint at which place the 2 rivers are near each other a butifull low\r\nleavel plain Commences, and extends up the Missourie & back, this plain\r\nis narrow at its commencement and widens as the Missouri bends north,\r\nand is bordered by an extencive wood land for many miles up the yellow\r\nStone river, this low plain is not Subject to over flow, appear to be a\r\nfew inches above high water mark and affords a butifull commanding\r\nSituation for a fort near the commencement of the Prarie, about ____\r\nmiles from the Point & ____ yards from the Missouri a Small lake is\r\nSituated, from this lake the plain rises gradually to a high butifull\r\nCountrey, the low Plain continues for Some distance up both rivers on\r\nthe Yellow Stone it is wide & butifull opsd. the point on the S. Side\r\nis Some high timbered land, about 11/2 miles below on the Same Side a\r\nlittle distance from the water is an elivated plain--Several of the\r\nparty was up the yellow Stone R Several miles, & informed that it\r\nmeandered throught a butifull Countrey Joseph Fields discovered a large\r\nCreek falling into the Yellowstone River on the S E Side 8 miles up\r\nnear which he Saw a big horn animal, he found in the Prarie the horn of\r\none of those animals which was large and appeared to have laid Several\r\nyears I Saw maney buffalow dead on the banks of the river in different\r\nplaces Some of them eaten by the white bears & wolves all except the\r\nSkin & bones, others entire, those animals either drounded in\r\nattempting to Cross on the ice dureing the winter or Swiming across to\r\nbluff banks where they Could not get out & too weak to return we Saw\r\nseveral in this Situation.\r\n\r\nemence numbers of antelopes in the forks of the river, Buffalow & Elk &\r\nDeer is also plenty beaver is in every bend. I observe that the Magpie\r\nGoose duck & Eagle all have their nests in the Same neighbourhood, and\r\nit is not uncommon for the Magpie to build in a few rods of the eagle,\r\nthe nests of this bird is built verry Strong with Sticks Covered verry\r\nthickly with one or more places through which they enter or escape, the\r\nGoose I make no doubt falls a pray to those vicious eagles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 27, 1805]\r\nSaturday April 27th 1805. Previous to our seting out this morning I\r\nmade the following observations.\r\n\r\nThis morning I walked through the point formed by the junction of the\r\nrivers; the woodland extends about a mile, when the rivers approach\r\neach other within less than half a mile; here a beatifull level low\r\nplain commences and extends up both rivers for many miles, widening as\r\nthe rivers recede from each other, and extending back half a mile to a\r\nplain about 12 feet higher than itself; the low plain appears to be a\r\nfew inches higher than high water mark and of course will not be liable\r\nto be overflown; tho where it joins the high plain a part of the\r\nMissouri when at it's greatest hight, passes through a channel of 60 or\r\n70 yards wide and falls into the yellowstone river. on the Missouri\r\nabout 21/2 miles from the entrance of the yellowstone river, and\r\nbetween this high and low plain, a small lake is situated about 200\r\nyards wide extending along the edge of the high plain parallel with the\r\nMissouri about one mile. on the point of the high plain at the lower\r\nextremity of this lake I think would be the most eligible site for an\r\nestablishment. between this low plain and the Yellowstone river their\r\nis an extensive body of timbered land extending up the river for many\r\nmiles. this site recommended is about 400 yards distant from the\r\nMissouri and about double that distance from the river yellowstone;\r\nfrom it the high plain, rising very gradually, extends back about three\r\nmiles to the hills, and continues with the same width between these\r\nhills and the timbered land on the yellowstone river, up that stream,\r\nfor seven or eight miles; and is one of the hadsomest plains I ever\r\nbeheld. on the Missouri side the hills sircumscribe it's width, & at\r\nthe distance of three miles up that river from this site, it is not\r\nmore than 400 yards wide. Capt Clark thinks that the lower extremity of\r\nthe low plane would be most eligible for this establishment; it is true\r\nthat it is much nearer both rivers, and might answer very well, but I\r\nthink it reather too low to venture a permanent establishment,\r\nparticularly if built of brick or other durable materials, at any\r\nconsiderable expence; for so capricious, and versatile are these\r\nrivers, that it is difficult to say how long it will be, untill they\r\ndirect the force of their currents against this narrow part of the low\r\nplain, which when they do, must shortly yeald to their influence; in\r\nsuch case a few years only would be necessary, for the annihilation of\r\nthe plain, and with it the fortification.--I continued my walk on\r\nshore; at 11 A.M. the wind became very hard from N. W. insomuch that\r\nthe perogues and canoes were unable either to proceede or pass the\r\nriver to me; I was under the necessity therefore of shooting a goose\r\nand cooking it for my dinner. the wind abated about 4. P.M. and the\r\nparty proceeded tho I could not conveniently join them untill night.\r\naltho game is very abundant and gentle, we only kill as much as is\r\nnecessary for food. I believe that two good hunters could conveniently\r\nsupply a regiment with provisions. for several days past we have\r\nobserved a great number of buffaloe lying dead on the shore, some of\r\nthem entire and others partly devoured by the wolves and bear. those\r\nanamals either drownded during the winter in attempting to pass the\r\nriver on the ice during the winter or by swiming acrss at present to\r\nbluff banks which they are unable to ascend, and feeling themselves too\r\nweak to return remain and perish for the want of food; in this\r\nsituation we met with several little parties of them.--beaver are very\r\nabundant, the party kill several of them every day. The Eagles,\r\nMagpies, and gees have their nests in trees adjacent to each other; the\r\nmagpye particularly appears fond of building near the Eagle, as we\r\nscarcely see an Eagle's nest unaccompanyed with two or three Magpies\r\nnests within a short distance.--The bald Eagle are more abundant here\r\nthan I ever observed them in any part of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 27, 1805]\r\n27th of April Satturday 1805\r\nafter take the azmuth of the Sun & brackfasting we Set out wind\r\nmoderate & a head, at 11 oClock the wind rose and continued to blow\r\nverry hard a head from the N. W. untill 4 oClock P M, which blew the\r\nSand off the Points in Such clouds as almost Covered us on the opposit\r\nbank, at 4 I Set out from my unpleasent Situation and proceeded on,\r\nCapt. Lewis walked on Shore in the Point to examine & view the Countrey\r\nand could not get to the boats untill night, Saw great numbers of Goats\r\nor antilopes, Elk, Swan Gees & Ducks, no buffalow to day I Saw Several\r\nbeaver and much Sign, I Shot one in the head which imediately Sunk,\r\naltho the game of different kinds are in abundance we Kill nothing but\r\nwhat we can make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 28, 1805]\r\nSunday April 28th 1805.\r\nSet out this morning at an early hour; the wind was favourable and we\r\nemployed our sails to advantage. Capt Clark walked on shore this\r\nmorning, and I proceeded with the party. the country through which we\r\npassed today is open as usual and very broken on both sides near the\r\nriver hills, the bottoms are level fertile and partially covered with\r\ntimber. the hills and bluffs exhibit their usual mineral appearances,\r\nsome birnt hills but no appearance of Pumicestone; coal is in great\r\nabundance and the salts still increase in quantity; the banks of the\r\nriver and sandbars are incrusted with it in many places and appear\r\nperfectly white as if covered with snow or frost.--the woods are now\r\ngreen, tho the plains and meadows appear to abate of the verdure those\r\nbelow exhibited some days past. we past three small runs today. two\r\nfalling in on the Stard. and one on the Lard. side, they are but small\r\nafford but little water and head a few miles back in the hills. we saw\r\ngreat quantities of game today; consisting of the common and mule deer,\r\nElk, Buffaloe, and Antelopes; also four brown bear, one of which was\r\nfired on and wounded by one of the party but we did not get it; the\r\nbeaver have cut great quantities of timber; saw a tree nearly 3 feet in\r\ndiameter that had been felled by them. Capt. Clark in the course of his\r\nwalk killed a deer and a goose; & saw three black bear; he thinks the\r\nbottoms are not so wide as they have been for some days past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 28, 1805]\r\n28th of April Sunday 1805\r\na fine day river falling, wind favourable from the S. E. and moderate,\r\nI walked on Shore to view the Countrey, from the top of the high hills,\r\nI beheld a broken & open Countrey on both Sides, near the river Some\r\nverry handsom low plains, I killd. a Deer & a goose, Saw three black\r\nbear great numbers of Elk antelopes & 2 Gangues of Buffalow, the hills\r\n& Bluffs Shew the Straturs of Coal, and burnt appearances in maney\r\nplaces, in and about them I could find no appearance of Pumice Stone,\r\nthe wood land have a green appearance, the Plains do not look So green\r\nas below, The bottoms are not So wide this afternoon as below Saw four\r\nbear this evening, one of the men Shot at one of them. The Antilopes\r\nare nearly red, on that part which is Subject to change i e the Sides &\r\n2/3 of the back from the head, the other part as white as Snow, 2 Small\r\nruns fall in on the S. Side and one this evening on the Lard Side those\r\nruns head at a fiew miles in the hills and discharge but little water,\r\nthe Bluffs in this part as also below Shew different Straturs of Coal\r\nor carbonated wood, and Coloured earth, such as dark brown, yellow a\r\nlightish brown, & a dark red &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 29, 1805]\r\nMonday April 29th 1805.\r\nSet out this morning at the usual hour; the wind was moderate; I walked\r\non shore with one man. about 8 A.M. we fell in with two brown or yellow\r\nbear; both of which we wounded; one of them made his escape, the other\r\nafter my firing on him pursued me seventy or eighty yards, but\r\nfortunately had been so badly wounded that he was unable to pursue so\r\nclosely as to prevent my charging my gun; we again repeated our fir and\r\nkilled him. it was a male not fully grown, we estimated his weight at\r\n300 lbs. not having the means of ascertaining it precisely. The legs of\r\nthis bear are somewhat longer than those of the black, as are it's\r\ntallons and tusks incomparably larger and longer. the testicles, which\r\nin the black bear are placed pretty well back between the thyes and\r\ncontained in one pouch like those of the dog and most quadrupeds, are\r\nin the yellow or brown bear placed much further forward, and are\r\nsuspended in seperate pouches from two to four inches asunder; it's\r\ncolour is yellowish brown, the eyes small, black, and piercing; the\r\nfront of the fore legs near the feet is usually black; the fur is finer\r\nthicker and deeper than that of the black bear. these are all the\r\nparticulars in which this anamal appeared to me to differ from the\r\nblack bear; it is a much more furious and formidable anamal, and will\r\nfrequently pursue the hunter when wounded. it is asstonishing to see\r\nthe wounds they will bear before they can be put to death. the Indians\r\nmay well fear this anamal equiped as they generally are with their bows\r\nand arrows or indifferent fuzees, but in the hands of skillfull\r\nriflemen they are by no means as formidable or dangerous as they have\r\nbeen represented. game is still very abundant we can scarcely cast our\r\neyes in any direction without percieving deer Elk Buffaloe or\r\nAntelopes. The quantity of wolves appear to increase in the same\r\nproportion; they generally hunt in parties of six eight or ten; they\r\nkill a great number of the Antelopes at this season; the Antelopes are\r\nyet meagre and the females are big with young; the wolves take them\r\nmost generally in attempting to swim the river; in this manner my dog\r\ncaught one drowned it and brought it on shore; they are but clumsey\r\nswimers, tho on land when in good order, they are extreemly fleet and\r\ndureable. we have frequently seen the wolves in pursuit of the Antelope\r\nin the plains; they appear to decoy a single one from a flock, and then\r\npursue it, alturnately relieving each other untill they take it. on\r\njoining Capt Clark he informed me that he had seen a female and faun of\r\nthe bighorned anamal; that they ran for some distance with great\r\naparent ease along the side of the river bluff where it was almost\r\nperpendicular; two of the party fired on them while in motion without\r\neffect. we took the flesh of the bear on board and proceeded. Capt.\r\nClark walked on shore this evening, killed a deer, and saw several of\r\nthe bighorned anamals. there is more appearance of coal today than we\r\nhave yet seen, the stratas are 6 feet thick in some instances; the\r\nearth has been birnt in many places, and always appears in stratas on\r\nthe same level with the stratas of coal. we came too this evening in\r\nthe mouth of a little river, which falls in on the Stard. side. This\r\nstream is about 50 yards wide from bank to bank; the water occupyes\r\nabout 15 yards. the banks are of earth only, abrupt, tho not high--the\r\nbed, is of mud principally. Capt Clark, who was up this streeam about\r\nthree miles, informed me that it continued about the same width, that\r\nit's current was gentle and it appeared navigable for perogus it\r\nmeanders through an extensive, fertile, and beautifull vally as far as\r\ncould bee seen about N. 30°W. there was but one solitary tree to be seen\r\non the banks of this river after it left the bottom of the Missouri.\r\nthe water of this river is clear, with a brownish yelow tint. here the\r\nhighlands receede from the Missouri, leaving the vally formed by the\r\nriver from seven to eight miles wide, and reather lower then usual.-\r\nThis stream my friend Capt. C. named Marthas river\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 29, 1805]\r\n29th of April Monday 1805\r\nSet out this morning at the usial hour. the wind is moderate & from the\r\nN E had not proceeded far eer we Saw a female & her faun of the Bighorn\r\nanimal on the top of a Bluff lying, the noise we made allarmed them and\r\nthey came down on the Side of the bluff which had but little Slope\r\nbeing nearly purpindicular, I directed two men to kill those anamals,\r\none went on the top and the other man near the water they had two Shots\r\nat the doe while in motion without effect, Those animals run & Skiped\r\nabout with great ease on this declivity & appeared to prefur it to the\r\nleavel bottom or plain. Capt Lewis & one man walkd on Shore and he\r\nkilled a yellow Bear & the man with him wounded one other, after\r\ngetting the flesh of the bear on bord which was not far from the place\r\nwe brackfast, we proceeded on Saw 4 gangus of buffalow and great\r\nnumbers of Antelopes in every direction also Saw Elk and Several\r\nwolves, I walked on Shore in the evening & killed a Deer which was So\r\nmeager as to be unfit for use The hills Contain more Coal, and has a\r\ngreater appearance of being burnt that below, the burnt parts appear on\r\na parrilel with the Stratiums of Coal, we Came too in the mouth of a\r\nLittle river on the S. S. which is about 50 or 60 yards from bank to\r\nbank, I was up this Stream 3 miles it continues its width and glides\r\nwith a gentle Current, its water is about 15 yards wide at this time,\r\nand appears to be navagable for Canoes &c. it meanders through a\r\nbutifull & extencive vallie as far as can be Seen about N 30° W. I saw\r\nonly a Single tree in this fertile vallie The water of the River is\r\nclear of a yellowish Colour, we call this river Martheys river in honor\r\nto the Selebrated M. F\r\n\r\nHere the high land widen from five to Eight miles and much lower than\r\nbelow, Saw Several of the big horn animals this evening. The Wolves\r\ndistroy great numbers of the antilopes by decoying those animals\r\nSingularly out in the plains and prosueing them alternetly, those\r\nantelopes are Curious and will approach any thing which appears in\r\nmotion near them &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 30, 1805]\r\nTuesday April 30th 1805.\r\nSet out at sunrise. the wind blew hard all last night, and continued to\r\nblow pretty hard all day, but not so much, as to compell us to ly by.\r\nthe country as usual is bare of timber; the river bottoms are level and\r\nfertile and extensive, but possess but little timber and that of an\r\nindifferent quality even of it's kind; principally low cottonwood,\r\neither too small for building, or for plank or broken and dead at top\r\nand unsound in the center of the trunk. saw great quantities of game as\r\nusual. Capt. Clark walked on shore the greater part of the day, past\r\nsome old Indian lodges built of drift wood; they appear to be of\r\nantient date and not recently inhabited.

Joseph Fields one of the hunters who was out today found\r\nseveral yards of scarlet cloth which had been suspended on the bough of\r\na tree near an old indian hunting camp, where it had been left as a\r\nsacrefice to the deity by the indians, probably of the Assinniboin\r\nnation, it being a custom with them as well as all the nations\r\ninhabiting the waters of the Missouri so far as they are known to us,\r\nto offer or sacrefice in this manner to the deity watever they may be\r\npossessed off which they think most acceptable to him, and very\r\nhonestly making their own feelings the test of those of the deity offer\r\nhim the article which they most prize themselves. this being the most\r\nusual method of weshiping the great sperit as they term the deity, is\r\npracticed on interesting occasions, or to produce the happy eventuation\r\nof the important occurrances incident to human nature, such as relief\r\nfrom hungar or mallady, protection from their enemies or the delivering\r\nthem into their hands, and with such as cultivate, to prevent the\r\nriver's overflowing and distroying their crops &c. screfices of a\r\nsimilar kind are also made to the deceased by their friends and\r\nrelatives. the are was very piercing this evening the water friezed on\r\nthe oars as they rowed. the wind dying at 5 P.M. we set out.\r\n\r\nevery thing which is incomprehensible to the indians they call big\r\nmedicine, and is the opperation of the presnts and power of the great\r\nsperit. this morning one of the men shot the indian dog that had\r\nfollowed us for several days, he would steal their cooked provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 2, 1805]\r\nMay 2nd Thursday 1805\r\nThe wind blew verry hard all the last night, this morning about Sunrise\r\nbegan to Snow, (The Thermomtr. at 28 abov o) and Continued untill about\r\n10 oClock, at which time it Seased, the wind Continued hard untill\r\nabout 2 P.M. the Snow which fell to day was about 1 In deep, a verry\r\nextroadernaley Climate, to behold the trees Green & flowers Spred on\r\nthe plain, & Snow an inch deep. we Set out about 3 oClock and proceeded\r\non about five 1/2 miles and encamped on the Std Side, the evening verry\r\ncold, Ice freesing to the Ores, I Shot a large beaver & Drewyer three\r\nin walking on the bank, the flesh of those animals the party is fond of\r\neating &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 3, 1805]\r\nFriday May 3rd 1805.\r\nThe morning being very could we did not set out as early as usual; ice\r\nformed on a kettle of water 1/4 of an inch thick. the snow has melted\r\ngenerally in the bottoms, but the hills still remain covered. on the\r\nlard side at the distance of 2 miles we passed a curious collection of\r\nbushes which had been tyed up in the form of a faciene and standing on\r\nend in the open bottom it appeared to be about 30 feet high and ten or\r\ntwelve feet in diameter, this we supposed to have been placed there by\r\nthe Indians, as a sacrefice for some purpose. The wind continued to\r\nblow hard from the West but not so strong as to compel us to ly by.\r\nCapt. Clark walked on shore and killed an Elk which he caused to be\r\nbutched by the time I arrived with the party, here we halted and dined\r\nbeing about 12 OCk. our usual time of halting for that purpose. after\r\ndinner Capt. Clark pursued his walk, while I continued with the party,\r\nit being a rule which we had established, never to be absent at the\r\nsame time from the party. the plains or high lands are much less\r\nelivated than they were, not being more than from 50 to 60 feet above\r\nthe river bottom, which is also wider than usual being from 5 to 9 ms.\r\nin width; traces of the ancient beds of the river are visible in many\r\nplaces through the whole extent of this valley. since the hills have\r\nbecome lower the appearance of the stratas of coal burnt hills and\r\npumice stone have in a great measure ceased; I saw none today. we saw\r\nvast quantities of Buffaloe, Elk, deer principally of the long tale\r\nkind, Antelope or goats, beaver, geese, ducks, brant and some swan.\r\nnear the entrance of the river mentioned in the 10th course of this\r\nday, we saw an unusual number of Porcupines from which we determined to\r\ncall the river after that anamal, and accordingly denominated it\r\nPorcupine river. this stream discharges itself into the Missouri on the\r\nStard. side 2000 miles above the mouth of the latter, it is a beatifull\r\nbold runing stream, 40 yards wide at it's entrance; the water is\r\ntransparent, it being the first of this discription that I have yet\r\nseen discharge itself into the Missouri; before it enters a large sand\r\nbar through which it discharges itself into the missouri it's banks and\r\nbottom are formed of a stiff blue and black clay; it appears to be\r\nnavigable for canoes and perogues at this time and I have no doubt but\r\nit might be navigated with boats of a considerable size in high water.\r\nit's banks appear to be from 8 to ten feet high and seldom overflow;\r\nfrom the quantity of water furnished by this river, the appearance of\r\nthe country, the direction it pursues, and the situation of it's\r\nentrance, I have but little doubt but it takes it's source not far from\r\nthe main body of the Suskashawan river, and that it is probably\r\nnavigable 150 miles; perhaps not very distant from that river. should\r\nthis be the case, it would afford a very favorable communication to the\r\nAthebaskay country, from whence the British N. W. Company derive so\r\nlarge a portion of their valuable furs.--Capt. Clark who ascended this\r\nriver several miles and passed it above where it entered the hills\r\ninformed me on his return that he found the general width of the bed of\r\nthe river about one hundred yards, where he passed the river the bed\r\nwas 112 yards wide, the water was knee deep and 38 yard in width; the\r\nriver which he could observe from the rising grounds for about 20\r\nmiles, bore a little to the East of North. there was a considerable\r\nportion of timber in the bottom lands of this river. Capt Clark also\r\nmet with limestone on the surface of the earth in the course of his\r\nwalk. he also saw a range of low mountains at a distance to the W of N\r\n, their direction being N. W. the country in the neighborhood of this\r\nriver, and as far as the eye can reach, is level, fertile, open and\r\nbeatifull beyond discription. 1/4 of a mile above the entrance of this\r\nriver a large creek falls in which we called 2000 mile creek. I sent\r\nRubin Fields to examine it, he reported it to be a bold runing stream,\r\nit's bed 30 yards wide. we proceeded about 3 miles abov this creek and\r\nencamped on the Stard. shore. I walked out a little distance and met\r\nwith 2 porcupines which were feeding on the young willow which grow in\r\ngreat abundance on all the sandbars; this anamal is exceedingly clumsy\r\nand not very watchfull I approached so near one of them before it\r\npercieved me that I touched it with my espontoon.--found the nest of a\r\nwild goose among some driftwood in the river from which we took three\r\neggs. this is the only nest we have met with on driftwood, the usual\r\nposition is the top of a broken tree, sometimes in the forks of a large\r\ntree but almost invariably, from 15 to 20 feet or upwards high.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 3, 1805]\r\nMay 3rd Friday 1805\r\nwe Set out reather later this morning than usial owing to weather being\r\nverry cold, a frost last night and the Thermt.

The high lands are low and from 8 to 9 miles apart and\r\nthere is evident marks of the bead of the river having been changed\r\nfrequently but little appearance of the Coal & burnt hills to day-\r\nGreat numbers of Buffalow, Elk, Deer, antilope, beaver, Porcupins, &\r\nwater fowls Seen to day, Such as, Geese, ducks of dift. kinds, & a fiew\r\nSwan--I continued my walk on Shore after dinner, and arrived at the\r\nmouth of a river on the St. Side, which appeared to be large, and I\r\nconcluded to go up this river a few miles to examine it accordingly I\r\nSet out North 1 mile thro wood or timbered bottom, 2 miles through a\r\nbutifull leavel plain, and 1 mile over a high plain about 50 feet\r\nhigher than the bottom & Came to the little river, which I found to be\r\na butifull clear Stream of about 100 yds. from bank to bank, (I waded\r\nthis river at the narrowest part and made it 112 Steps from bank to\r\nbank and at this place which was a kind of fording place the water was\r\nnear Knee deep, and 38 steps wide, the bottom of a hard stiff Black\r\nClay,) I observed a Great perportion of timber in the bottoms of this\r\nriver as far as I could See which was to the East of N. 18 or 20 miles,\r\nit appears to be navigable at this time for Canoes, and from\r\nappearances must be navagable a long distance for Perogus & boats in\r\nhigh water. This river we call Porcupine from the great number of those\r\nanamals found about it's mouth.--a Short distance above about 1/4 mile\r\nand on the Lard Side a large Creek falls in, which R. Fields went to\r\nexamine & reports that it is a bold running Stream, 30 yds wide as this\r\nCreek is 2000 miles up the Missouri we Call it the 2000 mile Creek, we\r\nproceeded on 3 miles & Camped on the S.

I walked on shore\r\nthis morning, the weather was more plesant, the snow has disappeared;\r\nthe frost seems to have effected the vegetation much less than could\r\nhave been expected the leaves of the cottonwood the grass the box alder\r\nwillow and the yellow flowering pea seem to be scarcely touched; the\r\nrosebushes and honeysuckle seem to have sustaned the most considerable\r\ninjury. The country on both sides of the Missouri continues to be open\r\nlevel fertile and beautifull as far as the eye can reach which from\r\nsome of the eminences is not short of 30 miles. the river bottoms are\r\nvery extensive and contain a much greater proportion of timber than\r\nusual; the fore part of this day the river was bordered with timber on\r\nboth sides, a circumstance which is extreemly rare and the first which\r\nhas occurred of any thing like the same extent since we left the\r\nMandans, in the after part of the day we passed an extensive beautifull\r\nplain on the Stard. side which gradually ascended from the river. I saw\r\nimmence quantities of buffaloe in every direction, also some Elk deer\r\nand goats; having an abundance of meat on hand I passed them without\r\nfiring on them; they are extreemly gentle the bull buffaloe\r\nparticularly will scarcely give way to you. I passed several in the\r\nopen plain within fifty paces, they viewed me for a moment as something\r\nnovel and then very unconcernedly continued to feed. Capt. Clark walked\r\non shore this evening and did not rejoin us untill after dark, he\r\nstruck the river several miles above our camp and came down to us. we\r\nsaw many beaver some which the party shot, we also killed two deer\r\ntoday. much sign of the brown bear. passed several old Indian hunting\r\ncamps in the course of the day one of them contained two large lodges\r\nwhich were fortifyed with old driftwood and fallen timber; this\r\nfortification consisted of a circular fence of timber lade horizontally\r\nlaping on and over laying each other to the hight of 5 feet. these\r\npounds are sometimes built from 20 to 30 feet in diameter and covered\r\nover with the trunks and limbs of old timber. the usual construction of\r\nthe lodges we have lately passed is as follows. three or more strong\r\nsticks the thickness of a man's leg or arm and about 12 feet long are\r\nattatched together at one end by a with of small willows, these are\r\nthen set on end and spread at the base, forming a circle of ten twelve\r\nor 14 feet in diameter; sticks of driftwood and fallen timber of\r\nconvenient size are now placed with one end on the ground and the other\r\nresting against those which are secured together at top by the with and\r\nwhich support and give the form to the whole, thus the sticks are laid\r\non untill they make it as thick as they design, usually about three\r\nranges, each piece breaking or filling up the interstice of the two\r\nbeneath it, the whole forming a connic figure about 10 feet high with a\r\nsmall apperture in one side which answers as a door. leaves bark and\r\nstraw are sometimes thrown over the work to make it more complete, but\r\nat best it affords a very imperfect shelter particularly without straw\r\nwhich is the state in which we have most usually found them.\r\n\r\nAt noon the sun was so much obscured that I could not obtain his\r\nmaridian Altitude which I much wished in order to fix the latitude of\r\nthe entrance of Porcupine river. Joseph Fields was very sick today with\r\nthe disentary had a high fever I gave him a doze of Glauber salts,\r\nwhich operated very well, in the evening his fever abated and I gave\r\nhim 30 drops of laudnum.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 4, 1805]\r\nMay 4th Satturday 1805\r\nThe rudder Irons of our large Perogue broke off last night, the\r\nreplaceing of which detained us this morning untill 9 oClock at which\r\ntime we Set out the wind a head from the west, The Countrey on each\r\nSide of the Missouri is a rich high and butifull the bottoms are\r\nextencive with a great deal of timber on them all the fore part of this\r\nday the wood land bordered the river on both Sides, in the after part a\r\nbutifull assending plain on the Std Side we Camped on the Std.

Saw great\r\nnumbers of anamals of different kinds on the banks, I Saw the black\r\nmartin to day-in the evening I walkd. on Shore on the Std Side & Struck\r\nthe river Several miles above our Camp & did not get to Camp untill\r\nSome time after night--we have one man Sick, The river has been falling\r\nfor Several days passed; it now begins to rise a little; the rate of\r\nrise & fall is from one to 3 inches in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 5, 1805]\r\nSunday May 5th 1805\r\nA fine morning I walked on shore untill 8 A M when we halted for\r\nbreakfast and in the course of my walk killed a deer which I carried\r\nabout a mile and a half to the river, it was in good order. soon after\r\nseting out the rudder irons of the white perogue were broken by her\r\nruning fowl on a sawyer, she was however refitted in a few minutes with\r\nsome tugs of raw hide and nales. as usual saw a great quantity of game\r\ntoday; Buffaloe Elk and goats or Antelopes feeding in every direction;\r\nwe kill whatever we wish, the buffaloe furnish us with fine veal and\r\nfat beef, we also have venison and beaver tales when we wish them; the\r\nflesh of the Elk and goat are less esteemed, and certainly are\r\ninferior. we have not been able to take any fish for some time past.\r\nThe country is as yesterday beatifull in the extreme.\r\n\r\nsaw the carcases of many Buffaloe lying dead along the shore partially\r\ndevoured by the wolves and bear. saw a great number of white brant also\r\nthe common brown brant, geese of the common kind and a small species of\r\ngeese which differ considerably from the common canadian goose; their\r\nneck head and beak are considerably thicker shorter and larger than the\r\nother in proportion to it's size, they are also more than a third\r\nsmaller, and their note more like that of the brant or a young goose\r\nwhich has not perfectly acquired his notes, in all other rispects they\r\nare the same in colour habits and the number of feathers in the tale,\r\nthey frequently also ascociate with the large geese when in flocks, but\r\nnever saw them pared off with the large or common goose. The white\r\nbrant ascociate in very large flocks, they do not appear to be mated or\r\npared off as if they intended to raise their young in this quarter, I\r\ntherefore doubt whether they reside here during the summer for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nthis bird is about the size of the common brown brant or two thirds of\r\nthe common goose, it is not so long by six inches from point to point\r\nof the wings when extended as the other; the beak head and neck are\r\nalso larger and stronger; their beak legs and feet are of a redish or\r\nfleshcoloured white. the eye is of moderate size, the puple of a deep\r\nsea green incircled with a ring of yellowish brown. it has sixteen\r\nfeathers of equal length in the tale; their note differs but little\r\nfrom the common brant, their flesh much the same, and in my opinion\r\npreferable to the goose, the flesh is dark. they are entirely of a\r\nbeatifull pure white except the large feathers of the 1st and second\r\njoints of the wings which are jut black. form and habits are the same\r\nwith the other brant; they sometimes ascociate and form one common\r\nflock. Capt Clark found a den of young wolves in the course of his walk\r\ntoday and also saw a great number of those anamals; they are very\r\nabundant in this quarter, and are of two species the small woolf or\r\nburrowing dog of the praries are the inhabitants almost invariably of\r\nthe open plains; they usually ascociate in bands of ten or twelve\r\nsometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by\r\ngame; not being able alone to take a deer or goat they are rarely ever\r\nfound alone but hunt in bands; they frequently watch and seize their\r\nprey near their burrows; in these burrows they raise their young and to\r\nthem they also resort when pursued; when a person approaches them they\r\nfrequently bark, their note being precisely that of the small dog. they\r\nare of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog, very\r\nactive fleet and delicately formed; the ears large erect and pointed\r\nthe head long and pointed more like that of the fox; tale long; the\r\nhair and fur also resembles the fox tho is much coarser and inferior.\r\nthey are of a pale redish brown colour. the eye of a deep sea green\r\ncolour small and piercing. their tallons are reather longer than those\r\nof the ordinary wolf or that common to the atlantic states, none of\r\nwhich are to be found in this quarter, nor I believe above the river\r\nPlat.--The large woolf found here is not as large as those of the\r\natlantic states. they are lower and thicker made shorter leged. their\r\ncolour which is not effected by the seasons, is a grey or blackish\r\nbrown and every intermediate shade from that to a creen coloured white;\r\nthese wolves resort the woodlands and are also found in the plains, but\r\nnever take refuge in the ground or burrow so far as I have been able to\r\ninform myself. we scarcely see a gang of buffaloe without observing a\r\nparsel of those faithfull shepherds on their skirts in readiness to\r\ntake care of the mamed & wounded. the large wolf never barks, but howls\r\nas those of the atlantic states do. Capt. Clark and Drewyer killed the\r\nlargest brown bear this evening which we have yet seen. it was a most\r\ntremendious looking anamal, and extreemly hard to kill notwithstanding\r\nhe had five balls through his lungs and five others in various parts he\r\nswam more than half the distance acoss the river to a sandbar & it was\r\nat least twenty minutes before he died; he did not attempt to attact,\r\nbut fled and made the most tremendous roaring from the moment he was\r\nshot. We had no means of weighing this monster; Capt. Clark thought he\r\nwould weigh 500 lbs. for my own part I think the estimate too small by\r\n100 lbs. he measured 8 Feet 71/2 Inches from the nose to the extremety\r\nof the hind feet, 5 F. to 1/2 Inch arround the breast, 1 F. 11 I.\r\narround the middle of the arm, & 3 F. 11 I. arround the neck; his\r\ntallons which were five in number on each foot were 4 1/8 Inches in\r\nlength. he was in good order, we therefore divided him among the party\r\nand made them boil the oil and put it in a cask for future uce; the oil\r\nis as hard as hogs lard when cool, much more so than that of the black\r\nbear. this bear differs from the common black bear in several respects;\r\nit's tallons are much longer and more blont, it's tale shorter, it's\r\nhair which is of a redish or bey brown, is longer thicker and finer\r\nthan that of the black bear; his liver lungs and heart are much larger\r\neven in proportion with his size; the heart particularly was as large\r\nas that of a large Ox. his maw was also ten times the size of black\r\nbear, and was filled with flesh and fish. his testicles were pendant\r\nfrom the belly and placed four inches assunder in seperate bags or\r\npouches.--this animal also feeds on roots and almost every species of\r\nwild fruit.\r\n\r\nThe party killed two Elk and a Buffaloe today, and my dog caught a\r\ngoat, which he overtook by superior fleetness, the goat it must be\r\nunderstood was with young and extreemly poor. a great number of these\r\ngoats are devowered by the wolves and bear at this season when they are\r\npoor and passing the river from S. W. to N. E. they are very inactive\r\nand easily taken in the water, a man can out swim them with great ease;\r\nthe Indians take them in great numbers in the river at this season and\r\nin autumn when they repass to the S. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 5, 1805]\r\n5th of May Sunday 1805\r\nWe Set out verry early and had not proceeded far before the rudder\r\nIrons of one of the Perogus broke which detained us a Short time Capt\r\nLewis walked on Shore this morning and killed a Deer, after brackfast I\r\nwalked on Shore Saw great numbers of Buffalow & Elk Saw also a Den of\r\nyoung wolves, and a number of (frown wolves in every direction, the\r\nwhite & Grey Brant is in this part of the Missouri I shot at the white\r\nbrant but at So great a distance I did not kill, The Countrey on both\r\nsides is as yesterday, handsom & fertile--The river rising & Current\r\nStrong & in the evening we Saw a Brown or Grisley beare on a Sand\r\nbeech, I went out with one man Geo. Drewyer & Killed the bear, which\r\nwas verry large and a turrible looking animal, which we found verry\r\nhard to kill we Shot ten Balls into him before we killed him, & 5 of\r\nthose Balls through his lights This animal is the largest of the\r\nCarnivorous kind I ever Saw we had nothing that could way him, I think\r\nhis weight may be Stated at 500 pounds, he measured 8 feet 71/2 In.\r\nfrom his nose to the extremity of the Toe, 5 feet 101/2 in. arround the\r\nbreast, 1 feet 11 Ins. around the middle of the arm, 3 feet 11 Ins.\r\narround the neck his tallents was 4 Inches &3/8 long, he was good\r\norder, and appeared verry different from the Common black bear in as\r\nmuch as his tallents were blunt, his tail Short, his liver & lights\r\nmuch larger, his maw ten times as large and Contained meat or flesh &\r\nfish only--we had him Skined and divided, the oile tried up & put in\r\nKegs for use. we Camped on the Stard Side, our men killed three Elk and\r\na Buffalow to day, and our Dog Cought an antilope a fair race, this\r\nanimal appeared verry pore & with young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 6, 1805]\r\nMonday May 6th 1805.\r\nThe morning being fair and pleasant and wind favourable we set sale at\r\nan early hour, and proceeded on very well the greater part of the day;\r\nthe country still continues level fertile and beautifull, the bottoms\r\nwide and well timbered comparitively speaking with other parts of the\r\nriver; no appearance of birnt hills pumice stone or coal, the salts of\r\ntartar or vegitable salts continues to appear on the river banks, sand\r\nbars and in many parts of the plains most generally in the little\r\nrevines at the base of the low hills. passed three streames today which\r\ndischarged themselves on the Lard. side; the first of these we call\r\nlittle dry creek it contained some water in standing pools but\r\ndischarged none, the 2ed 50 yards wide no Water, we called it Big dry\r\nCreek, the 3rd is bed of a conspicuous river 200 yards wide which we\r\ncalled little dry river; the banks of these streams are low and bottoms\r\nwide with but little timber, their beds are almost entirely formed of a\r\nfine brown sand intermixed with a small proportion of little pebbles,\r\nwhich were either transparent, white, green, red, yellow or brown.\r\nthese streams appeared to continue their width without diminution as\r\nfar as we could perceive them, which with rispect to the river was many\r\nmiles, they had recenly discharged their waters. from the appearance of\r\nthese streams, and the country through which they passed, we concluded\r\nthat they had their souces in level low dry plains, which probably is\r\nthe character of the country for a great distance west of this, or to\r\nthe vicinity of the black hills, that the country being low on the same\r\nlevel nearly and in the same parallel of latitude, that the rains in\r\nthe spring of the year suddonly melts the snow at the same time and\r\ncauses for a few days a vast quantity of water which finds it's way to\r\nthe Missouri through those channels; by reference to the diary of the\r\nweather &c it will be percieved that there is scarcely any rain during\r\nthe summer Autumn and winter in this open country distant from the\r\nmountains. Fields still continues unwell. saw a brown bear swim the\r\nriver above us, he disappeared before we can get in reach of him; I\r\nfind that the curiossity of our party is pretty well satisfyed with\r\nrispect to this anamal, the formidable appearance of the male bear\r\nkilled on the 5th added to the difficulty with which they die when even\r\nshot through the vital parts, has staggered the resolution several of\r\nthem, others however seem keen for action with the bear; I expect these\r\ngentlemen will give us some amusement shotly as they soon begin now to\r\ncoppolate. saw a great quantity of game of every species common here.\r\nCapt Clark walked on shore and killed two Elk, they were not in very\r\ngood order, we therefore took a part of the meat only; it is now only\r\namusement for Capt. C. and myself to kill as much meat as the party can\r\nconsum; I hope it may continue thus through our whole rout, but this I\r\ndo not much expect. two beaver were taken in traps this morning and one\r\nsince shot by one of the party. saw numbers of these anamals peeping at\r\nus as we passed out of their wholes which they form of a cilindric\r\nshape, by burrowing in the face of the abbrupt banks of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 6, 1805]\r\nMay 6th Monday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the N.

Side, neither of them discharged any water\r\ninto the Missouri, they were wide and Continued their width for Some\r\ndistance, the little water of those Creeks & the little river must wash\r\nthe low Country, I believe those Streams to be the Conveyance of the\r\nwater of the heavy rains & melting Snows in the Countrey back &c. &c. I\r\nwalked on Shore and Killed two Elk neither of which was fat, we saved\r\nthe best of the meat, one beaver Shot to day. the countrey on both\r\nSides butifull no appearances of either Coal or pumice Stone & burnt\r\nhills, The Salts of Tarter or white aprs. of Salts are yet to be Seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 7, 1805]\r\nTuesday May 7th 1805.\r\nA fine morning, set out at an early hour; the drift wood begins to come\r\ndown in consequence of the river's rising; the water is somewhat\r\nclearer than usual, a circumstance I did not expect on it's rise. at 11\r\nA.M. the wind became so hard that we were compelled to ly by for\r\nseveral hours, one of the small canoes by the bad management of the\r\nsteersman filled with water and had very nearly sunk; we unloaded her\r\nand dryed the baggage; at one we proceed on the wind having in some\r\nmeasure abated. the country we passed today on the North side of the\r\nriver is one of the most beautifull plains we have yet seen, it rises\r\ngradually from the river bottom to the hight of 50 or 60 feet, then\r\nbecoming level as a bowling green. extends back as far as the eye can\r\nreach; on the S. side the river hills are more broken and much higher\r\ntho some little destance back the country becomes level and fertile. no\r\nappearance of birnt hills coal or pumicestone, that of salts still\r\ncontinue. vegitation appears to have advanced very little since the\r\n28th Ulto.--we continue to see a great number of bald Eagles, I presume\r\nthey must feed on the carcases of dead anamals, for I see no fishing\r\nhawks to supply them with their favorite food. the water of the river\r\nis so terbid that no bird wich feeds exclusively on fish can subsist on\r\nit; from it's mouth to this place I have neither seen the blue crested\r\nfisher nor a fishing hawk. this day we killed 3 Buffaloe 1 Elk & 8\r\nbeaver; two of the Buffaloe killed by Capt Clark near our encampment of\r\nthis evening wer in good order dressed them and saved the meat, the Elk\r\nI killed this morning, thought it fat, but on examineation found it so\r\nlean that we took the tongue marrowbones and Skin only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 7, 1805]\r\nMay 7th Tuesday, 1805\r\nA fine morning river rose 11/2 Inches last night, the drift wood\r\nbeginning to run the water Something Clearer than usial, the wind\r\nbecame verry hard, and at 11 oClock one Canoe by bad Stearing filled\r\nwith water, which detained us about 3 hours, had a Meridian altitude,\r\nthe Laid. from which is 47°36' 11\" 6/10 The Countrey on the North Side of\r\nthe Missouri is one of the handsomest plains we have yet Seen on the\r\nriver the plain rises from the river bottom gradually. The Hills on the\r\nSouth Side is high & uneavin. no appearance of Coal or burnt hills,\r\nthat of Salts Still appear; vegitation appears to be Slow, I walked on\r\nthe bank to day and Shot 2 beaver, in the evening Killed two Buffalow\r\nin tolerable order which we Saved and Camped on the Lard Side. 8\r\nbeaver, 3 buffalow & an Elk killed to day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 8, 1805]\r\nWednesday May 8th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour under a gentle brieze from the East. a black\r\ncloud which suddonly sprung up at S. E. soon over shaddowed the\r\nhorizon; at 8 A.M. it gave us a slight sprinke of rain, the wind became\r\nmuch stronger but not so much so as to detain us. we nooned it just\r\nabove the entrance of a large river which disimbogues on the Lard.\r\nside; I took the advantage of this leasure moment and examined the\r\nriver about 3 miles; I found it generally 150 yards wide, and in some\r\nplaces 200. it is deep, gentle in it's courant and affords a large\r\nboddy of water; it's banks which are formed of a dark rich loam and\r\nblue clay are abbrupt and about 12 feet high. it's bed is principally\r\nmud. I have no doubt but it is navigable for boats perogues and canoes,\r\nfor the latter probably a great distance. the bottoms of this stream ar\r\nwide, level, fertile and possess a considerable proportion of timber,\r\nprincipally Cottonwood. from the quantity of water furnised by this\r\nriver it must water a large extent of country; perhaps this river also\r\nmight furnish a practicable and advantageous communication with the\r\nSaskashiwan river; it is sufficiently large to justify a belief that it\r\nmight reach to that river if it's direction be such. the water of this\r\nriver possesses a peculiar whiteness, being about the colour of a cup\r\nof tea with the admixture of a tablespoonful) of milk. from the colour\r\nof it's water we called it Milk river. (we think it possible that this\r\nmay be the river called by the Minitares the river which scoalds at all\r\nothers or ____) Capt Clark who walked this morning on the Lard. shore\r\nascended a very high point opposite to the mouth of this river; he\r\ninformed me that he had a perfect view of this river and the country\r\nthrough which it passed for a great distance (probably 50 or 60 Miles,)\r\nthat the country was level and beautifull on both sides of the river,\r\nwith large herds of Buffaloe distributed throughout that the river from\r\nit's mouth boar N. W. for 12 or 15 Miles when it forked, the one taking\r\na direction nearly North, and the other to the West of N. West. from\r\nthe appearance of the vallies and the timber on each of these streams\r\nCapt. C. supposed that they were about the same size. great appearance\r\nof beaver on this river, and I have no doubt but what they continue\r\nabundant, there being plenty of cottonwood and willow, the timber on\r\nwhich they subsist. The country on the Lard. side of the river is\r\ngenerally high broken hills, with much broken, grey black and brown\r\ngrannite scattered on the surface of the earth in a confused manner.\r\nThe wild Licquorice is found on the sides of these hills, in great\r\nabundance. at a little distance from the river there is no timber to be\r\nseen on either side; the bottom lands are not more than one fifth\r\ncovered with timber; the timber as below is confined to the borders of\r\nthe river. in future it will be understood that there is no timber of\r\nany discription on the upland unless particularly mentioned; and also\r\nthat one fifth of the bottom lands being covered with timber is\r\nconsidered a large proportion. The white apple is found in great\r\nabundance in this neighbourhood; it is confined to the highlands\r\nprincipally. The whiteapple, so called by the French Engages, is a\r\nplant which rises to the hight of 6 or 9 Inchs. rarely exceeding a\r\nfoot; it puts forth from one to four and sometimes more stalks from the\r\nsame root, but is most generally found with one only, which is branched\r\nbut not defusely, is cylindric and villose; the leafstalks, cylindric,\r\nvillose and very long compared with the hight of the plant, tho\r\ngradually diminish in length as they ascend, and are irregular in point\r\nof position; the leaf, digitate, from three to five in number, oval 1\r\nInch long, absolutely entire and cottony; the whole plant of a pale\r\ngreen, except the under disk of the leaf which is of a white colour\r\nfrom the cottony substance with which it is covered. the radix a\r\ntuberous bulb; generally ova formed, sometimes longer and more rarely\r\npartially divided or brancing; always attended with one or more\r\nradicles at it's lower extremity which sink from 4 to 6 inches deep.\r\nthe bulb covered with a rough black, tough, thin rind which easily\r\nseperates from the bulb which is a fine white substance, somewhat\r\nporus, spungy and moist, and reather tough before it is dressed; the\r\ncenter of the bulb is penitrated with a small tough string or ligament,\r\nwhich passing from the bottom of the stem terminates in the extremity\r\nof the radicle, which last is also covered by a prolongation of the\r\nrind which invellopes the bulb. The bulb is usually found at the debth\r\nof 4 inches and frequently much deeper. This root forms a considerable\r\narticle of food with the Indians of the Missouri, who for this purpose\r\nprepare them in several ways. they are esteemed good at all seasons of\r\nthe year, but are best from the middle of July to the latter end of\r\nAutumn when they are sought and gathered by the provident part of the\r\nnatives for their winter store. when collected they are striped of\r\ntheir rhind and strung on small throngs or chords and exposed to the\r\nsun or placed in the smoke of their fires to dry; when well dryed they\r\nwill keep for several years, provided they are not permitted to become\r\nmoist or damp; in this situation they usually pound them between two\r\nstones placed on a piece of parchment, untill they reduce it to a fine\r\npowder thus prepared they thicken their soope with it; sometimes they\r\nalso boil these dryed roots with their meat without breaking them; when\r\ngreen they are generally boiled with their meat, sometimes mashing them\r\nor otherwise as they think proper. they also prepare an agreeable dish\r\nwith them by boiling and mashing them and adding the marrow grease of\r\nthe buffaloe and some buries, until the whole be of the consistency of\r\na haisty pudding. they also eat this root roasted and frequently make\r\nhearty meals of it raw without sustaining any inconvenience or injury\r\ntherefrom. The White or brown bear feed very much on this root, which\r\ntheir tallons assist them to procure very readily. the white apple\r\nappears to me to be a tastless insippid food of itself tho I have no\r\ndoubt but it is a very healthy and moderately nutricious food. I have\r\nno doubt but our epicures would admire this root very much, it would\r\nserve them in their ragouts and gravies in stead of the truffles\r\nmorella.\r\n\r\nWe saw a great number buffaloe, Elk, common and Black taled deer, goats\r\nbeaver and wolves. Capt C. killed a beaver and a wolf, the party killed\r\n3 beaver and a deer. We can send out at any time and obtain whatever\r\nspecies of meat the country affords in as large quantity as we wish. we\r\nsaw where an Indian had recently grained, or taken the hair off of a\r\ngoatskin; we do not wish to see those gentlemen just now as we presume\r\nthey would most probably be the Assinniboins and might be troublesome\r\nto us. Capt C. could not be certain but thought he saw the smoke and\r\nsome Indian lodges at a considrable distance up Milk river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 8, 1805]\r\nMay the 8th Wednesday 1805\r\na verry black Cloud to the S W. we Set out under a gentle breeze from\r\nthe N. E. about 8 oClock began to rain, but not Sufficient to wet, we\r\npassed the mouth of a large river on the Starboard Side 150 yards wide\r\nand appears to be navagable. the Countrey thro which it passes as far\r\nas Could be seen from the top of a verry high hill on which I was, a\r\nbutifull leavil plain this river forks about N W from its mouth 12 or\r\n15 miles one fork runs from the North & the other to the West of N W.\r\nthe water of this river will justify a belief that it has its Sourse at\r\na considerable distance, and waters a great extent of Countrey--we are\r\nwilling to believe that this is the River the Minitarres Call the river\r\nwhich Scolds at all others\r\n\r\nthe Countrey on the Lard.

The party killed 3 Beaver 1 Deer I saw where an\r\nIndian had taken the hair off a goat Skin a fiew days past--Camped\r\nearly on the Lard. Side. The river we passed today we call Milk river\r\nfrom the peculiar whiteness of it's water, which precisely resembles\r\ntea with a considerable mixture of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 9, 1805]\r\nThursday May 9th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour; the wind being favourable we used our sails\r\nand proceeded very well; the country in appearance is much as yester,\r\nwith this difference that the land appears more fertile particularly of\r\nthe Lard. hills which are not so stoney and less broken; the timber has\r\nalso in some measure declined in quantity. today we passed the bed of\r\nthe most extraordinary river that I ever beheld. it is as wide as the\r\nMissouri is at this place or 1/2 a mile wide and not containing a\r\nsingle drop of runing water; some small standing pools being all the\r\nwater that could be per-ceived. it falls in on the Lard. side. I walked\r\nup this river about three miles and ascended an eminence from which I\r\ncould perceive it many miles; it's course about South for 10 or 12\r\nmiles, when it viered around to the E of S. E. as far as I could see.\r\nthe valley of this river is wide and possesses but a scanty proportion\r\nof timber; the hills which border it are not very high nor is the\r\ncountry very broken; it is what may properly be designated a wavy or\r\nroling country intersperced with some handsom level plains. the bank\r\nare low and abbrupt, seldom more than 6 or eight feet above the level\r\nof the bed, yet show but little appearance of being overflown; they are\r\nof black or yellow clay or a rich sandy loam. the bed is entirely\r\ncomposed of a light brown sand the particles of which as well as that\r\nof the Missoury are remarkably fine. this river I presume must extend\r\nback as far as the black hills and probably is the channel through\r\nwhich a great extent of plain country discharge their superfluous\r\nwaters in the spring season. it had the appearance of having recently\r\ndischarged it's waters; and from the watermark, it did not appear that\r\nit had been more than 2 feet deep at it's greatest hight. This stream\r\n(if such it can properly be termed) we called Big dry river. about a\r\nmile below this river on the same side a large creek falls in also dry\r\nat present. The mineral salts and quarts appear in large quantities in\r\nthis neighbourhood. the sand of the Missouri from it's mouth to this\r\nplace has always possessed a mixture of granulated talk or I now think\r\nmost probably that it is this quarts. Capt C. killed 2 bucks and 2\r\nbuffaloe, I also killed one buffaloe which proved to be the best meat,\r\nit was in tolerable order; we saved the best of the meat, and from the\r\ncow I killed we saved the necessary materials for making what our\r\nwrighthand cook Charbono calls the boudin blanc, and immediately set\r\nhim about preparing them for supper; this white pudding we all esteem\r\none of the greatest delacies of the forrest, it may not be amiss\r\ntherefore to give it a place. About 6 feet of the lower extremity of\r\nthe large gut of the Buffaloe is the first mosel that the cook makes\r\nlove to, this he holds fast at one end with the right hand, while with\r\nthe forefinger and thumb of the left he gently compresses it, and\r\ndischarges what he says is not good to eat, but of which in the squel\r\nwe get a moderate portion; the mustle lying underneath the shoulder\r\nblade next to the back, and fillets are next saught, these are needed\r\nup very fine with a good portion of kidney suit; to this composition is\r\nthen added a just proportion of pepper and salt and a small quantity of\r\nflour; thus far advanced, our skilfull opporater C-o seizes his\r\nrecepticle, which has never once touched the water, for that would\r\nintirely distroy the regular order of the whole procedure; you will not\r\nforget that the side you now see is that covered with a good coat of\r\nfat provided the anamal be in good order; the operator sceizes the\r\nrecepticle I say, and tying it fast at one end turns it inwards and\r\nbegins now with repeated evolutions of the hand and arm, and a brisk\r\nmotion of the finger and thumb to put in what he says is bon pour\r\nmanger; thus by stuffing and compressing he soon distends the\r\nrecepticle to the utmost limmits of it's power of expansion, and in the\r\ncourse of it's longtudinal progress it drives from the other end of the\r\nrecepticle a much larger portion of the ____ than was prevously\r\ndischarged by the finger and thumb of the left hand in a former part of\r\nthe operation; thus when the sides of the recepticle are skilfully\r\nexchanged the outer for the iner, and all is compleatly filled with\r\nsomething good to eat, it is tyed at the other end, but not any cut\r\noff, for that would make the pattern too scant; it is then baptised in\r\nthe missouri with two dips and a flirt, and bobbed into the kettle;\r\nfrom whence after it be well boiled it is taken and fryed with bears\r\noil untill it becomes brown, when it is ready to esswage the pangs of a\r\nkeen appetite or such as travelers in the wilderness are seldom at a\r\nloss for.\r\n\r\nwe saw a great quantity of game today particularly of Elk and Buffaloe,\r\nthe latter are now so gentle that the men frequently throw sticks and\r\nstones at them in order to drive them out of the way. we also saw this\r\nevening emence quantities of timber cut by the beaver which appeared to\r\nhave been done the preceeding year, in place particularly they had cut\r\nall the timber down for three acres in front and on nearly one back\r\nfrom the river and had removed a considerable proportion of it, the\r\ntimber grew very thick and some of it was as large as a man's body. the\r\nriver for several days has been as wide as it is generally near it's\r\nmouth, tho it is much shallower or I should begin to dispair of ever\r\nreaching it's source; it has been crouded today with many sandbars; the\r\nwater also appears to become clearer, it has changed it's complexin\r\nvery considerably. I begin to feel extreemly anxious to get in view of\r\nthe rocky mountains.\r\n\r\nI killed four plover this evening of a different species from any I\r\nhave yet seen; it resembles the grey or whistling plover more than any\r\nother of this family of birds; it is about the size of the yellow\r\nlegged or large grey plover common to the lower part of this river as\r\nwell as most parts of the Atlantic States where they are sometimes\r\ncalled the Jack curloo; the eye is moderately large, are black with a\r\nnarrow ring of dark yellowish brown; the head, neck, upper part of the\r\nbody and coverts of the wings are of a dove coloured brown, which when\r\nthe bird is at rest is the predominant colour; the brest and belley are\r\nof a brownish white; the tail is composed of 12 feathers of 3 Ins.\r\nbeing of equal length, of these the two in the center are black, with\r\ntraverse bars of yellowish brown; the others are a brownish white. the\r\nlarge feathers of the wings are white tiped with blacked. the beak is\r\nblack, 21/2 inches in length, slightly tapering, streight of a\r\ncilindric form and blontly or roundly pointed; the chaps are of equal\r\nlength, and nostrils narrow. longitudional and connected; the feet and\r\nlegs are smoth and of a greenish brown; has three long toes and a short\r\none on each foot, the long toes are unconnected with a web, and the\r\nshort one is placed very high up the leg behind, insomuch that it dose\r\nnot touch the ground when the bird stands erect. the notes of this bird\r\nare louder and more various than any other of this family that I have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 9, 1805]\r\nMay 9th Thursday 1805\r\na fine Day wind from the East we proceeded on verry well the Countrey\r\nmuch the appearance which it had yesterday the bottom & high land rich\r\nblack earth, Timber not so abondant as below, we passed the mouth of a\r\nriver (or the appearance of a river) on the Lard.

The hunters\r\nreturned this evening having seen no tents or Indians nor any fresh\r\nsign of them; they killed two Mule deer, one common fallow or\r\nlongtailed deer, 2 Buffaloe and 5 beaver, and saw several deer of the\r\nMule kind of immence size, and also three of the Bighorned anamals.\r\nfrom the appearance of the Mule deer and the bighorned anamals we\r\nbeleive ourselves fast approaching a hilly or mountainous country; we\r\nhave rarely found the mule deer in any except a rough country; they\r\nprefer the open grounds and are seldom found in the woodlands near the\r\nriver; when they are met with in the woodlands or river bottoms and are\r\npursued, they invariably run to the hills or open country as the Elk\r\ndo. the contrary happens with the common deer ther are several\r\nesscential differences between the Mule and common deer as well in form\r\nas in habits. they are fully a third larger in general, and the male is\r\nparticularly large; I think there is somewhat greater disparity of size\r\nbetween the male and female of this speceis than there is between the\r\nmale and female fallow deer; I am convinced I have seen a buck of this\r\nspecies twice the volume of a buck of any other species. the ears are\r\npeculiarly large; I measured those of a large buck which I found to be\r\neleven inches long and 31/2 in width at the widest part; they are not\r\nso delicately formed, their hair in winter is thicker longer and of a\r\nmuch darker grey, in summer the hair is still coarser longer and of a\r\npaleer red, more like that of the Elk; in winter they also have a\r\nconsiderable quantity of a very fine wool intermixed with the hair and\r\nlying next to the skin as the Antelope has. the long hair which grows\r\non the outer sides of the 1st joint of the hinder legs, and which in\r\nthe common deer do not usually occupy more than 2 inches in them\r\noccupys from 6 to eight; their horns also differ, these in the common\r\ndeer consist of two main beams from which one or more points project\r\nthe beam graduly deminishing as the points procede from it, with the\r\nmule deer the horns consist of two beams which at the distance of 4 or\r\n6 inches from the head divide themselves each into two equal branches\r\nwhich again either divide into two other equal branches or terminate in\r\na smaller, and two equal ones; having either 2 4 or 6 points on a beam;\r\nthe horn is not so rough about the base as the common deer and are\r\ninvariably of a much darker colour. the most striking difference of\r\nall, is the white rump and tale. from the root of the tail as a center\r\nthere is a circular spot perfectly white, of abot 3 inches radius,\r\nwhich occupys a part of the rump and extremitys of the buttocks and\r\njoins the white of the belley underneath; the tail which is usually\r\nfrom 8 to 9 inches long, for the first 4 or 5 inches from it's upper\r\nextremity is covered with short white hairs, much shorter indeed than\r\nthe hairs of the body; from hence for about one inch further the hair\r\nis still white but gradually becomes longer, the tail then terminates\r\nin a tissue of black hair of about 3 Inches long. from this black hair\r\nof the tail they have obtained among the French engages the appelation\r\nof the black taled deer, but this I conceive by no means characteristic\r\nof the anamal as much the larger portion of the tail is white. the year\r\nand the tail of this anamal when compared with those of the common\r\n(leer, so well comported with those of the mule when compared with the\r\nhorse, that we have by way of distinction adapted the appellation of\r\nthe mule deer which I think much more appropriate. on the inner corner\r\nof each eye there is a drane or large recepicle which seems to answer\r\nas a drane to the eye which gives it the appearance of weeping, this in\r\nthe common deer of the atlantic states is scarcely perceptable but\r\nbecomes more conspicuous in the fallow deer, and still more so in the\r\nElk; this recepticle in the Elk is larger than in any of the pecora\r\norder with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nBoils and imposthumes have been very common with the party Bratton is\r\nnow unable to work with one on his hand; soar eyes continue also to be\r\ncommon to all of us in a greater or less degree. for the imposthume I\r\nuse emmolient poltices, and for soar eyes a solution of white vitriol\r\nand the sugar of lead in the proportion of 2 grs. of the former and one\r\nof the latter to each ounce of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 10, 1805]\r\nMay the 10th Friday 1805\r\nriver fell 3/4 of an inch last night, wind from the N.

Set out this morning at an early hour, the\r\ncourant strong; and river very crooked; the banks are falling in very\r\nfast; I sometimes wonder that some of our canoes or perogues are not\r\nswallowed up by means of these immence masses of earth which are\r\neternally precipitating themselves into the river; we have had many\r\nhair breadth escapes from them but providence seems so to have ordered\r\nit that we have as yet sustained no loss in consequence of them. The\r\nwind blue very hard the forepart of last night but abated toward\r\nmorning; it again arose in the after part of this day and retarded our\r\nprogress very much. the high lands are broken, the hills higher and\r\napproach nearer the river, tho the soil of both hills and bottoms\r\nappear equally as furtile as below; it consists of a black looking tome\r\nwith a moderate portion of sand; the hills and bluffs to the debth of\r\n20 or thirty feet, seemed to be composed entirely of this loam; when\r\nthrown in the water it desolves as readily as loaf sugar and\r\neffervesses like marle. great appearance of quarts and mineral salts,\r\nthe latter appears both on the hills and bottoms, in the bottoms of the\r\ngullies which make down from the hills it lies incrusting the earth to\r\nthe debth of 2 or 3 inches, and may with a fether be swept up and\r\ncollected in large quantities, I preserved several specimines of this\r\nsalts. the quarts appears most commonly in the faces of the bluffs. no\r\ncoal, burnt hills, or pumice stone. saw today some high hills on the\r\nStard. whose summits were covered with pine. Capt Clark went on shore\r\nand visited them; he brought with him on his return som of the boughs\r\nof this pine it is of the pitch kind but I think the leaves somewhat\r\nlonger than ours in Virginia. Capt C. also in his walk killed 2 Mule\r\ndeer a beaver and two buffaloe; these last he killed about 3 miles\r\nabove where we encamped this evening in the expectation that we would\r\nreach that place, but we were unable to do so from the adverse winds\r\nand other occurrences, and he came down and joined us about dark. there\r\nis a dwarf cedar growing among the pine on the hills; it rises to the\r\nhight thre sometimes 4 feet, but most generally spreads itself like a\r\nvine along the surface of the earth, which it covers very closely,\r\nputing out roots from the underside of the limbs; the leaf is finer and\r\nmore delicate than the common red ceader, it's fruit and smell are the\r\nsame with the red ceader. the tops of these hills which produce the\r\npine and cedar is of a different soil from that just described; it is a\r\nlight coloured poor sterile sandy soil, the base usually a yellow or\r\nwhite clay; it produces scarcely any grass, some scattering tuffts of\r\nsedge constitutes the greater part of it's grass. About 5 P.M. my\r\nattention was struck by one of the Party runing at a distance towards\r\nus and making signs and hollowing as if in distress, I ordered the\r\nperogues to put too, and waited untill he arrived; I now found that it\r\nwas Bratton the man with the soar hand whom I had permitted to walk on\r\nshore, he arrived so much out of breath that it was several minutes\r\nbefore he could tell what had happened; at length he informed me that\r\nin the woody bottom on the Lard. side about 11/2 below us he had shot a\r\nbrown bear which immediately turned on him and pursued him a\r\nconsiderable distance but he had wounded it so badly that it could not\r\novertake him; I immediately turned out with seven of the party in quest\r\nof this monster, we at length found his trale and persued him about a\r\nmile by the blood through very thick brush of rosbushes and the large\r\nleafed willow; we finally found him concealed in some very thick brush\r\nand shot him through the skull with two balls; we proceeded dress him\r\nas soon as possible, we found him in good order; it was a monstrous\r\nbeast, not quite so large as that we killed a few days past but in all\r\nother rispects much the same the hair is remarkably long fine and rich\r\ntho he appears parshally to have discharged his winter coat; we now\r\nfound that Bratton had shot him through the center of the lungs,\r\nnotwithstanding which he had pursued him near half a mile and had\r\nreturned more than double that distance and with his tallons had\r\nprepared himself a bed in the earth of about 2 feet deep and five long\r\nand was perfectly alive when we found him which could not have been\r\nless than 2 hours after he received the wound; these bear being so hard\r\nto die reather intimedates us all; I must confess that I do not like\r\nthe gentlemen and had reather fight two Indians than one bear; there is\r\nno other chance to conquer them by a single shot but by shooting them\r\nthrough the brains, and this becomes difficult in consequence of two\r\nlarge muscles which cover the sides of the forehead and the sharp\r\nprojection of the center of the frontal bone, which is also of a pretty\r\ngood thickness. the flece and skin were as much as two men could\r\npossibly carry. by the time we returned the sun had set and I\r\ndetermined to remain here all night, and directed the cooks to render\r\nthe bear's oil and put it in the kegs which was done. there was about\r\neight gallons of it.\r\n\r\nthe wild Hysop grows here and in all the country through which we have\r\npassed for many days past; tho from big Dry river to this place it has\r\nbeen more abundant than below, and a smaller variety of it grows on the\r\nhills, the leaves of which differ considerably being more deeply\r\nindented near it's extremity. the buffaloe deer and Elk feed on this\r\nherb in the winter season as they do also on the small willow of the\r\nsandbars. there is another growth that begins now to make it's\r\nappearance in the bottom lands and is becoming extreemly troublesome;\r\nit is a shrub which rises to the hight of from two to four feet, much\r\nbranched, the bark of the trunk somewhat rough hard and of light grey\r\ncolour; the wood is firm and stif, the branches beset with a great\r\nnumber of long, shap, strong, wooddy looking thorns; the leaf is about\r\n3/4 or an inch long, and one 1/8 of an inch wide, it is obtuse,\r\nabsolutely entire, veinless fleshy and gibbose; has no perceptable\r\ntaste or smell, and no anamal appears to eat it. by way of designating\r\nwhen I mention it hereafter I shall call it the fleshey leafed thorn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 11, 1805]\r\nMay the 11th Satturday 1805.\r\nWind hard fore part of last night the latter part verry Cold a white\r\nfrost this morning, the river riseing a little and verry Crooked the\r\nhigh land is rugged and approaches nearer than below, the hills and\r\nbluff exhibit more mineral quats & Salts than below, the gullies in\r\nmaney places are white, and their bottoms one, two & 3 Inches deep of\r\nthis mineral, no appearance of either burnt pumice Stone or Coal, the\r\nCountrey hilley on both Sides of a rich black earth, which disolves\r\nThis kind of Countrey Continues of the Same quallity for maney miles on\r\neither Side, we observed Some hills which appeared to be timbered, I\r\nwalked to this timber and found it to pitch pine & Dwarf Cedar, we\r\nobserve in every derection Buffalow, Elk, Antelopes & Mule deer\r\ninumerable and So jintle that we Could approach near them with great\r\nease, I killed 2 Mule Deer for the benifit of their Skins for the\r\nparty, and about the place I expected the party would get to Camp I\r\nkilled 2 fat Bulls for theire use, in my absence they had killed a fine\r\nfat Yellow bear below which detained them and they did not reach the\r\nplace I expected, but had Camped on the Lard.

I ascended the hills and had a view of a\r\nrough and broken country on both sides of the river; on the North side\r\nthe summits of the hills exhibit some scattering pine and cedar, on the\r\nSouth side the pine has not yet commenced tho there is some cedar on\r\nthe face of the hills and in the little ravines. the choke cherry also\r\ngrows here in the hollows and at the heads of the gullies; the choke\r\nCherry has been in blume since the ninth inst. this growth has\r\nfreequently made it's appearance on the Missouri from the neighbourhood\r\nof the Baldpated Prarie, to this place in the form of it's leaf colour\r\nand appearance of it's bark, and general figure of it's growth it\r\nresembles much the Morillar cherry,1 tho much smaller not generally\r\nrising to a greater hight than from 6 to 10 feet and ascociating in\r\nthick clusters or clumps in their favorit situations which is usually\r\nthe heads of small ravines or along the sides of small brooks which\r\nflow from the hills. the flowers which are small and white are\r\nsupported by a common footstalk as those of the common wild cherry are,\r\nthe corolla consists of five oval petals, five stamen and one\r\npistillum, and of course of the Class and order Pentandria Monogynia.\r\nit bears a fruit which much resembles the wild cherry in form and\r\ncolour tho larger and better flavoured; it's fruit ripens about the\r\nbegining of July and continues on the trees untill the latter end of\r\nSeptember--The Indians of the Missouri make great uce of this cherry\r\nwhich they prepare for food in various ways, sometimes eating when\r\nfirst plucked from the trees or in that state pounding them mashing the\r\nseed boiling them with roots or meat, or with the prarie beans and\r\nwhite-apple; again for their winter store they geather them and lay\r\nthem on skins to dry in the sun, and frequently pound them and make\r\nthem up in small roles or cakes and dry them in the sun; when thus\r\ndryed they fold them in skins or put them in bags of parchment and keep\r\nthem through the winter either eating them in this state or boiling\r\nthem as before mentioned. the bear and many birds also feed on these\r\nburries. the wild hysop sage, fleshey leaf thorn, and some other herbs\r\nalso grow in the plains and hills, particularly the arromatic herb on\r\nwhich the Antelope and large hare feed. The soil has now changed it's\r\ntexture considerably; the base of the hills and river bottoms continue\r\nthe same and are composed of a rich black loam while the summits of the\r\nhills and about half their hight downwards are of a light brown colour,\r\npoor sterile and intermixed with a coarse white sand. about 12 OClock\r\nthe wind veered about to the N.

I felt an inclination to eat some veal\r\nand walked on shore and killed a very fine buffaloe calf and a large\r\nwoolf, much the whitest I had seen, it was quite as white as the wool\r\nof the common sheep. one of the party wounded a brown bear very badly,\r\nbut being alone did not think proper to pursue him. In the evening the\r\nmen in two of the rear canoes discovered a large brown bear lying in\r\nthe open grounds about 300 paces from the river, and six of them went\r\nout to attack him, all good hunters; they took the advantage of a small\r\neminence which concealed them and got within 40 paces of him\r\nunperceived, two of them reserved their fires as had been previously\r\nconscerted, the four others fired nearly at the same time and put each\r\nhis bullet through him, two of the balls passed through the bulk of\r\nboth lobes of his lungs, in an instant this monster ran at them with\r\nopen mouth, the two who had reserved their fires discharged their\r\npieces at him as he came towards them, boath of them struck him, one\r\nonly slightly and the other fortunately broke his shoulder, this\r\nhowever only retarded his motion for a moment only, the men unable to\r\nreload their guns took to flight, the bear pursued and had very nearly\r\novertaken them before they reached the river; two of the party betook\r\nthemselves to a canoe and the others seperated an concealed themselves\r\namong the willows, reloaded their pieces, each discharged his piece at\r\nhim as they had an opportunity they struck him several times again but\r\nthe guns served only to direct the bear to them, in this manner he\r\npursued two of them seperately so close that they were obliged to throw\r\naside their guns and pouches and throw themselves into the river altho\r\nthe bank was nearly twenty feet perpendicular; so enraged was this\r\nanamal that he plunged into the river only a few feet behind the second\r\nman he had compelled take refuge in the water, when one of those who\r\nstill remained on shore shot him through the head and finally killed\r\nhim; they then took him on shore and butched him when they found eight\r\nballs had passed through him in different directions; the bear being\r\nold the flesh was indifferent, they therefore only took the skin and\r\nfleece, the latter made us several gallons of oil; it was after the sun\r\nhad set before these men come up with us, where we had been halted by\r\nan occurrence, which I have now to recappitulate, and which altho\r\nhappily passed without ruinous injury, I cannot recollect but with the\r\nutmost trepidation and horror; this is the upseting and narrow escape\r\nof the white perogue It happened unfortunately for us this evening that\r\nCharbono was at the helm of this Perogue, in stead of Drewyer, who had\r\npreviously steered her; Charbono cannot swim and is perhaps the most\r\ntimid waterman in the world; perhaps it was equally unluckey that Capt.\r\nC. and myself were both on shore at that moment, a circumstance which\r\nrarely happened; and tho we were on the shore opposite to the perogue,\r\nwere too far distant to be heard or to do more than remain spectators\r\nof her fate; in this perogue ____ were embarked, our papers,\r\nInstruments, books medicine, a great part of our merchandize and in\r\nshort almost every article indispensibly necessary to further the\r\nviews, or insure the success of the enterprize in which we are now\r\nlaunched to the distance of 2200 miles. surfice it to say, that the\r\nPerogue was under sail when a sudon squawl of wind struck her\r\nobliquely, and turned her considerably, the steersman allarmed, in\r\nstead of puting her before the wind, lufted her up into it, the wind\r\nwas so violent that it drew the brace of the squarsail out of the hand\r\nof the man who was attending it, and instantly upset the perogue and\r\nwould have turned her completely topsaturva, had it not have been from\r\nthe resistance mad by the oarning against the water; in this situation\r\nCapt. C and myself both fired our guns to attract the attention if\r\npossible of the crew and ordered the halyards to be cut and the sail\r\nhawled in, but they did not hear us; such was their confusion and\r\nconsternation at this moment, that they suffered the perogue to lye on\r\nher side for half a minute before they took the sail in, the perogue\r\nthen wrighted but had filled within an inch of the gunwals; Charbono\r\nstill crying to his god for mercy, had not yet recollected the rudder,\r\nnor could the repeated orders of the Bowsman, Cruzat, bring him to his\r\nrecollection untill he threatend to shoot him instantly if he did not\r\ntake hold of the rudder and do his duty, the waves by this time were\r\nruning very high, but the fortitude resolution and good conduct of\r\nCruzat saved her; he ordered 2 of the men to throw out the water with\r\nsome kettles that fortunately were convenient, while himself and two\r\nothers rowed her ashore, where she arrived scarcely above the water; we\r\nnow took every article out of her and lay them to drane as well as we\r\ncould for the evening, baled out the canoe and secured her; there were\r\ntwo other men beside Charbono on board who could not swim, and who of\r\ncourse must also have perished had the perogue gone to the bottom.\r\nwhile the perogue lay on her side, finding I could not be heard, I for\r\na moment forgot my own situation, and involluntarily droped my gun,\r\nthrew aside my shot pouch and was in the act of unbuttoning my coat,\r\nbefore I recollected the folly of the attempt I was about to make,\r\nwhich was to throw myself into the river and indevour to swim to the\r\nperogue; the perogue was three hundred yards distant the waves so high\r\nthat a perogue could scarcely live in any situation, the water\r\nexcessively could, and the stream rappid; had I undertaken this project\r\ntherefore, there was a hundred to one but what I should have paid the\r\nforfit of my life for the madness of my project, but this had the\r\nperogue been lost, I should have valued but little.--After having all\r\nmatters arranged for the evening as well as the nature of circumstances\r\nwould permit, we thought it a proper occasion to console ourselves and\r\ncheer the sperits of our men and accordingly took a drink of grog and\r\ngave each man a gill of sperits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 14, 1805]\r\n14th of May Tuesday 1805\r\nA verry Clear Cold morning a white frost & some fog on the river the\r\nThermomtr Stood at 32 above 0, wind from the S. W. we proceeded on\r\nverry well untill about 6 oClock a Squawl of wind Struck our Sale broad\r\nSide and turned the perogue nearly over, and in this Situation the\r\nPerogue remained untill the Sale was Cut down in which time She nearly\r\nfiled with water--the articles which floated out was nearly all caught\r\nby the Squar who was in the rear. This accident had like to have cost\r\nus deerly; for in this perogue were embarked our papers, Instruments,\r\nbooks, medicine, a great proportion of our merchandize, and in short\r\nalmost every article indispensibly necessary to further the views, or\r\ninsure the success of the enterprize in which, we are now launched to\r\nthe distance of 2,200 miles. it happened unfortunately that Capt. Lewis\r\nand myself were both on shore at the time of this occurrence, a\r\ncircumstance which seldom took place; and tho we were on the shore\r\nopposit to the perogue were too far distant to be heard or do more than\r\nremain spectators of her fate; we discharged our guns with the hope of\r\nattracting the attention of the crew and ordered the sail to be taken\r\nin but such was their consternation and confusion at the instant that\r\nthey did not hear us. when however they at length took in the sail and\r\nthe perogue wrighted; the bowsman Cruzatte by repeated threats so far\r\nbrought Charbono the Sternman to his recollection that he did his duty\r\nwhile two hands bailed the perogue and Cruzatte and two others rowed\r\nher on shore were she arrived scarcely above the water. we owe the\r\npreservation of the perogue to the resolution and fortitude of Cruzatte\r\n\r\nThe Countrey like that of yesterday, passed a Small Island and the\r\nenterence of 3 large Creeks, one on the Stard. & the other 2 on the\r\nLard Side, neither of them had any running water at this time--Six good\r\nhunters of the party fired at a Brown or Yellow Bear Several times\r\nbefore they killed him, & indeed he had like to have defeated the whole\r\nparty, he pursued them Seperately as they fired on him, and was near\r\nCatching Several of them one he pursued into the river, this bear was\r\nlarge & fat would way about 500 wt; I killed a Buffalow, & Capt.

I walked on shore this evening and killed a\r\nbuffaloe cow and calf, we found the calf most excellent veal. the\r\ncountry on either side of the river is broken and hills much higher\r\nthan usual, the bottoms now become narrow and the timber more scant;\r\nsome scattering pine and cedar on the steep declivities of the hills.-\r\nthis morning a white bear toar Labuiche's coat which he had left in the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 16, 1805]\r\nMay 16th Thursday 1805 a fair morning our articles all out to Dry at 4\r\noClock we had every thing that was Saved dry and on bord, our loss is\r\nSome medison, Powder, Seeds, & Several articles which Sunk, and maney\r\nSpoiled had a medn. altitude which gave for Latd. _° _' _\" N.--two of our\r\nmen fired at a pant hr a little below our Camp, this animale they say\r\nwas large, had Caught a Deer & eate it half & buried the ballance. a\r\nfiew antilope Swam the river near our Camp two of them were Cought by\r\nthe party in the river. at half past 4 oClock we Set out and proceeded\r\non verry well ____ miles and incamped on the Std.

Side and killed a Cow & Calf\r\nthe calf was verry fine their bases. it is somewhat singular that the\r\nlower part of these hills appear to be formed of a dark rich loam while\r\nthe upper region about 150 feet is formed of a whiteish brown sand, so\r\nhard in many parts as to resemble stone; but little rock or stone of\r\nany kind to be seen in these hills. the river is much narrower than\r\nusual, the bed from 200 to 300 yards only and possessing a much larger\r\nproportion of gravel than usual. a few scattering cottonwood trees are\r\nthe only timber near the river; the sandbars, and with them the willow\r\npoints have almost entirely disappeared. greater appearance than usual\r\nof the saline incrustations of the banks and river hills. we passed two\r\ncreeks the one on Stard. side, and the other just below our camp on the\r\nLard. side; each of these creeks afford a small quantity of runing\r\nwater, of a brackish tast. the great number of large beds of streams\r\nperfectly dry which we daily pass indicate a country but badly watered,\r\nwhich I fear is the case with the country through which we have been\r\npassing for the last fifteen or twenty days. Capt Clark walked on shore\r\nthis evening and killed an Elk; buffaloe are not so abundant as they\r\nwere some days past. the party with me killed a female brown bear, she\r\nwas but meagre, and appeared to have suckled young very recently. Capt.\r\nClark narrowly escaped being bitten by a rattlesnake in the course of\r\nhis walk, the party killed one this evening at our encampment, which he\r\ninformed me was similar to that he had seen; this snake is smaller than\r\nthose common to the middle Atlantic States, being about 2 feet 6 inches\r\nlong; it is of a yellowish brown colour on the back and sides,\r\nvariagated with one row of oval spots of a dark brown colour lying\r\ntransversely over the back from the neck to the tail, and two other\r\nrows of small circular spots of the same colour which garnis the sides\r\nalong the edge of the scuta. it's bely contains 176 scuta on the belly\r\nand 17 on the tale. Capt Clark informed me that he saw some coal which\r\nhad been brought down by the water of the last creek we passed; this\r\ncreek also throws out considerable quantities of Driftwood, though\r\nthere is no timber on it which can be perceived from the Missouri; we\r\ncalled this stream rattlesnake creek. Capt Clark saw an Indian\r\nfortifyed camp this evening, which appeared to have been recently\r\noccupyed, from which we concluded it was probable that it had been\r\nformed by a war party of the Menetares who left their vilage in March\r\nlast with a view to attack the blackfoot Indians in consequence of\r\ntheir having killed some of their principal warriors the previous\r\nautumn. we were roused late at night by the Sergt. of the guard, and\r\nwarned of the danger we were in from a large tree that had taken fire\r\nand which leant immediately over our lodge. we had the loge removed,\r\nand a few minutes after a large proportion of the top of the tree fell\r\non the place the lodge had stood; had we been a few minutes later we\r\nshould have been crushed to attoms. the wind blew so hard, that\r\nnotwithstanding the lodge was fifty paces distant from the fire it\r\nsustained considerable injury from the burning coals which were thrown\r\non it; the party were much harrassed also by this fire which\r\ncommunicated to a collection of fallen timber, and could not be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 17, 1805]\r\nMay 17th Friday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the N W. mercury at 60° a 0. river falling a\r\nlittle. we Set out at an early hour and proceeded on verry well by the\r\nassistance of the Toe rope principally, the Countrey verry rugged &\r\nhills high and the river washing the base on each Side, Great\r\nappearance of the Salt Substance. a fiew Cotton trees is the only\r\ntimber which is Scattered in the bottoms & the hills contain a fiew\r\nPine & Cedar, which is Scattered. river much narrower than below from 2\r\nto 300 yards wide, the bottoms muddey & hills rich earth except near\r\ntheir topes--We passed 2 large Creeks to day one on the Starbd Side and\r\nthe other just below our camp on the Lard.

Capt Clark in\r\nthe course of his walk this evening killed four deer, two of which were\r\nthe black tailed or mule deer; the skins are now good, they have not\r\nyet produced their young.--we saw a number of buffaloe, Elk, deer and\r\nAntelopes.--the saline substance frequently mentioned continues to\r\nappear as usual.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 18, 1805]\r\nMay 18th Satturday 1805\r\nA windey morning wind from the West we proceeded on verry well with the\r\nassistance of the Toe Coard, river narrow but flew Sand bars, & current\r\njentle, but a few Cotton Trees Contained in the bottoms willow is not\r\ncommon on the bears as usial Some little on the Sides of the river is\r\nyet to be Seen, the after part of the day was Cloudy & at about 12\r\noClock it began to rain and continued moderately for about 11/2 hours,\r\nnot Sufficient to wet a man thro his clothes; this is the first rain\r\nSince we Set out this Spring The hills widen and the bottoms Contain\r\nmore timber than for Several days past, we passed a Wisers Creek on the\r\nStd. Side about 3 oClock and Camped on the Lard Side opposit the lower\r\npoint of a handsom little Island near the middle of the river. I walked\r\non Shore and killed four Deer, 2 common & 2 mule deer, one of which had\r\n3 fauns, 2 others had 2 each, those deer are fat, & their Skins\r\ntolerable good, which are now in demand with us for clothes Such as\r\nLegins & Mockersons, I Saw great numbers of Buffalows & Elk; Some of\r\nthe party Shoot & Catch beaver every day & night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 19, 1805]\r\nSunday May 19th 1805.\r\nThe last night was disagreeably could; we were unable to set out untill\r\n8 oclock A.M. in consequence of a heavy fogg, which obscured the river\r\nin such a manner that we could not see our way; this is the first we\r\nhave experienced in any thing like so great a degree; there was also a\r\nfall of due last evening, which is the second we have experienced since\r\nwe have entered this extensive open country. at eight we set out and\r\nproceeded as yesterday by means of the cord principally, the hills are\r\nhigh and the country similar to that of yesterday. Capt Clark walked on\r\nshore with two of the hunters and killed a brown bear; notwithstanding\r\nthat it was shot through the heart it ran at it's usual pace near a\r\nquarter of a mile before it fell. one of the party wounded a beaver,\r\nand my dog as usual swam in to catch it; the beaver bit him through the\r\nhind leg and cut the artery; it was with great difficulty that I could\r\nstop the blood; I fear it will yet prove fatal to him. on Capt. Clark's\r\nreturn he informed me that he had from the top of one of the adjacent\r\nhights discovered the entrance of a large stream which discharged\r\nitself into the Missouri on the Lard. side distant 6 or seven miles;\r\nfrom the same place he also saw a range of Mountains, bearing W.\r\ndistant 40 or 50 miles; they appeared to proceed in a S. S. W.\r\ndirection; the N. N. E. extremity of these mountains appeared abrupt.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon the river was croked, rappid and containing more sawyers\r\nthan we have seen in the same space since we left the entrance of the\r\nriver Platte. Capt. C. in the course of his walk killed three deer and\r\na beaver, I also walked on shore this evening a few miles and killed an\r\nElk, a buck, and a beaver. the party killed and caught 4 other beaver &\r\n3 deer.\r\n\r\nThe men complain much of sore eyes and imposthumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 19, 1805]\r\nMay 19th Sunday 1805\r\na verry cold night, the murckery Stood at 38 at 8 oClock this morning,\r\na heavy dew which is the 2d I have Seen this Spring. The fog (which was\r\nthe first) was So thick this morning that we could not Set out untill\r\nthe Sun was about 2 hours up, at which time a Small breeze Sprung up\r\nfrom the E. which Cleared off the fog & we proceeded on by means of the\r\nCord The hills are high & rugged the Countrey as yesterday--I walked on\r\nShore with two men we killed a white or grey bear; not withstanding\r\nthat it was Shot through the heart it ran at it's usial pace near a\r\nquarter of a mile before it fell. Capt Lewis's dog was badly bitten by\r\na wounded beaver and was near bleading to death-. after killing the\r\nBear I continued my walk alone, & killed 3 Deer & a Beaver; finding\r\nthat the Perogues were below I assended the highest hill I could See,\r\nfrom the top of which I Saw the mouth of M. Shell R & the meanderings\r\nof the Missouri for a long distance. I also Saw a high mountain in a\r\nwesterley direction, bearing S. S W. about 40 or 50 miles distant, in\r\nthe evening the river was verry Crooked and much more rapid &\r\nContaining more Sawyers than any which we have passed above the River\r\nPlatte Capt Lewis walked on Shore this after noon & killed an Elk, Buck\r\n& a Beaver, I kiled three Deer at dinner, the hunters killed three\r\nother Deer to day Several beaver also killed. We Camped on the Stard\r\nSide in a bottom of Small Cotton wood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 20, 1805]\r\nMonday May 20th 1805\r\nSet out at an early hour as usual, the banks being favourable and water\r\nstrong we employed the toe rope principally; river narrow and croked;\r\ncountry much as that of yesterday; immence number of the prickley pears\r\nin the plains and on the hills. At the distance of 21/4 miles passed\r\nthe entrance of a large Creek, affording but little water; this stream\r\nwe named Blowing Fly Creek, from the immence quantities of those\r\ninsects found in this neighbourhood, they infest our meat while\r\nroasting or boiling, and we are obliged to brush them off our provision\r\nas we eat. At 11 A.M. we arrived at the entrance of a handsome bold\r\nriver which discharges itself into the Missouri on the Lard. side; this\r\nstream we take to be that called by the Minnetares the ____ or\r\nMuscleshell River; if it be the same, of which I entertain but little\r\ndoubt, it takes it's rise, by their information in the 1st Chain of the\r\nRocky Mountains at no great distance from the Yellow stone river, from\r\nwhence in it's course to this place it passes through a high and broken\r\ncountry pretty well timbered, particularly on it's borders, and\r\nintersperced with handsome fertile plains and medows. but from the\r\ncircumstance of the same Indians informing us that we should find a\r\nwell timbered country in the neighbourhood of it's mouth, I am induced\r\nto beleive that the timbered country of which they speak is similar to\r\nthat we have passed for a day or two, or that in our view above, which\r\nconsists of nothing more than a few scattering small scrubby pine and\r\ndwarf cedar on the summits of some of the highest hills nine tenths of\r\nthe country being wholy destitute of timber of any kind, covered with a\r\nshort grass, arromatic herbs and the prickley pear; the river bottom\r\nhowever, so far as we have explored it or 8 m. are well stocked with\r\nCottonwood timber of tollerable size, & lands of excellent quality. We\r\nhalted at thentrance of the river on the point formed by it's junction\r\nwith the Missouri determining to spend the day, make the necessary\r\nobservations and send out some hunters to explore the country. The\r\nMuscle Shell river falls into the Missouri 2270 miles above it's mouth,\r\nand is 110 yards in width, it affords much more water than streams of\r\nit's width generally do below, it's courant is by no means rappid, and\r\nfrom appearances it might be navigated with canoes a considerable\r\ndistance; it's bed is coarse sand and gravel principally with an\r\noccasion mixture of black mud; it's banks abbrupt and about 12 feet\r\nhigh yet never appear to overflow; the waters of this river is of a\r\ngreenish yellow cast, much more transparent than the Missouri, which\r\nlast is also much more transparent than below but still retains it's\r\nwhiteish hue and a proportion of it's sedement. the Missouri opposite\r\nto this point is deep, gentle in it's courant, and 222 yards in width.\r\nThe hunters returned this evening and informed us that the country\r\ncontinued much the same in appearance as that we saw where we were or\r\nbroken, and that about five miles abe the mouth of shell river a\r\nhandsome river of about fifty yards in width discharged itself into the\r\nshell river on the Stard. or upper side; this stream we called\r\nSah-ca-gar me-ah or bird woman's River, after our interpreter the Snake\r\nwoman. Shields also found a bould spring or fountain issuing from the\r\nfoot of the Lard. hills about 4 miles up the Missouri; a fountain in\r\nthis plain country is a great novelty; I have not seen a bould fountain\r\nof pure water except one since I left the Mandans; there a number of\r\nsmall ones but all without exception are impregnated with the salts\r\nwhich abound in this country, and with which I believe the Missoury\r\nitself considerably impregnated but to us in the habit of useing it not\r\nperceptible; the exception I make is a very fine fountain under the\r\nbluffs on the Lard. side of the Missouri and at a distance from the\r\nriver about five miles below the entrance of the yellowstone River. The\r\nsands of the Missouri are not so abundant as they have been for some\r\ntime past, being confined to the points only; the bed of the river\r\nprincipally mud and still too deep to use the seting pole. Capt. Clark\r\nwalked out today and killed two deer and an Elk, the hunters killed 4\r\ndeer and elk and a buffaloe. I saw two large Owls with remarkable long\r\nfeathers on the sides of the head which resembled ears; I take them to\r\nbe the large hooting owl tho they are somewhat larger and their colours\r\nbrighter than those common to the J States.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 20, 1805]\r\nMay 20th Monday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the N E. river falling a little We Set out at\r\n7 oClock and proceeded on verry well as usial by the assistance of the\r\nCord passed Some verry Swift water, river narrow and Crooked, at 11\r\noClock arrived at the mouth of Shell river on the Lard Side and formed\r\na Camp for the present. haveing passed a large Creek about 4 miles\r\nbelow on the Ld Side which we call Blowing fly Creek from the emence\r\nquantites of those insects which geather on our meat in Such numbers\r\nthat we are oblige to brush them off what we eate.\r\n\r\nmuscle Shell River falls in on Lard Side 2270 miles up Contains a\r\ngreater perportion of water than Rivers of its Size below, I measured\r\nit and find it to be 110 yards wide, the water of a Greenish yellow\r\nColour, and appers to be navagable for Small Craft, The Minetarras\r\ninform us that this river heads in the 1st of the rockey Mountains &\r\npasses through a broken Countrey. its head at no great distance from\r\nthe Yellow Stone River The Countrey about this river as described\r\nyesterday we took the Meredian altitude 59° 50' 0\" back observation and\r\nfound the Latd. to be 47° 0' 24\"\r\n\r\nThe Missouri at the mouth of Shell River is 222 yards wide with a Smoth\r\nCurrent the Missouri water is not So muddey as below, but retains\r\nnearly its usial Cholour, and the Sands principally Confined to the\r\npoints I killed two Deer & an Elk, the hunters killed an Elk & Several\r\ndeer mearly for their Skins to make Leagins,--Sent men out in every\r\nderection, the Countrey generally verry broken Some leavel plains up\r\nthe Shell river The bottoms of the Shell river is well timbered as also\r\na Small river which falls into that river on the upper Side 5 miles\r\nabove its mouth.

Mineral appearances as usual.\r\nthe growse or praire hen are now less abundant on the river than they\r\nwere below; perhaps they betake themselves to the open plains at a\r\ndistance from the river at this season.-\r\n\r\nThe wind which was moderate all the fore part of the day continued to\r\nencrease in the evening, and about dark veered about to N. W. and blew\r\na storm all night, in short we found ourselves so invelloped with\r\nclouds of dust and sand that we could neither cook, eat, nor sleep; and\r\nwere finally compelled to remove our lodge about eight oClock at night\r\nto the foot of an adjacent hill where we were covered in some measure\r\nfrom the wind by the hills. several loose articles blown over board and\r\nlost. our first station was on a bar on Stard. opposite the lower point\r\nof a small Island, which we now called windy Island. the bends of the\r\nriver are short and suddon, the points covered with some cottonwood,\r\nlarger willow, or broadleafed willow with an abundance of the wild rose\r\nand some small honeysuckle bushes constitute the undergrowth, the\r\nredwood is also found in small quantities.

Salts and other mineral appearances as\r\nusual. the river continues about the same width or from 200 to 250 yds.\r\nwide, fewer sandbars and the courant more gentle and regular; game not\r\nso abundant as below the Muscle Shell river. I killed a deer in the\r\ncourse of my walk today. Capt. C. also walked out this evening and took\r\na view of the country from a conspicuous point and found it the same as\r\nhas been discribed. we have caught but few fish since we left the\r\nMandans, they do not bite freely, what we took were the white cat of 2\r\nto 5 lbs. I presume that fish are scarce in this part of the river. We\r\nencamped earlyer this evening than usual in order render the oil of a\r\nbear which we killed. I do not believe that the Black bear common to\r\nthe lower part of this river and the Atlantic States, exists in this\r\nquarter; we have neither seen one of them nor their tracks which would\r\nbe easily distinguished by it's shortness of tallons when compared with\r\nthe brown grizly or white bear.

W. of it and appear to be about\r\n30 mes. distant, perhaps it heads in them. This range of mountains\r\nappear to be about 70 miles long runing from E to W. having their\r\nEastern extremity about 30 mes. distant in a northwardly direction from\r\npot Island.--also passed two small creeks on Lard. and two others on\r\nStard. all inconsiderable and dry at their entrances. just above the\r\nentrance of Teapot Creek on the stard. there is a large assemblage of\r\nthe burrows of the Burrowing Squirrel they generally seelect a south or\r\na south Easterly exposure for their residence, and never visit the\r\nbrooks or river for water; I am astonished how this anamal exists as it\r\ndose without water, particularly in a country like this where there is\r\nscarcely any rain during Yi of the year and more rarely any due; yet we\r\nhave sometimes found their villages at the distance of five or six\r\nmiles from any water, and they are never found out of the limits of the\r\nground which their burrows occupy; in the Autumn when the hard frosts\r\ncommence they close their burrows and do not venture out again untill\r\nspring, indeed some of them appear to be yet in winter quarters. passed\r\n3 Islands the two first covered with tall cottonwood timber and the\r\nlast with willows only. river more rappid, & the country much the same\r\nas yesterday. some spruce pine of small size appears among the pitch\r\npine, and reather more rock than usual on the face of the hills.

This tract of country so called consists of a collection\r\nof high broken and irregular hills and short chain of mountains\r\nsometimes 120 miles in width and again becomeing much narrower, but\r\nalways much higher than the country on either side; they commence about\r\nthe head of the Kanzas river and to the West of that river near the\r\nArkansas, from whence they take their course a little to the W. of N.\r\nW. approaching the rockey Mountains obliquely, passing the river platte\r\nabove the forks and intercepting the Yellowstone river near the big\r\nbend and passing the Missouri at this place and probably continuing to\r\nswell the country as far North as the Saskashawan river tho they are\r\nlower here than they are discribed to the Sth. and may therefore\r\nprobably terminate before they reach the Suskashawan. the black hills\r\nin their course nothwardly appear to approach more nearly to the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nWe set out at an early hour this morning and proceed on principally by\r\nthe chord untill about 9 A.M. when a fine breeze sprung up from the S.\r\nE. and enabled us though the ballance of the day to employ our sails to\r\nadvantage; we proceed at a pretty good pace notwithstanding the courant\r\nof the river was very strong. we passed two large and four small\r\nIslands; also several streams on either side; the first of these is a\r\nlarge Creek or small river which disinboged on the Stard. side about\r\n11/2 miles above our encampment of last evening, it is 30 yards wide\r\nand contains some water. the bed is gravley and intermixed with some\r\nstone, it takes its rise in the mountains which are situated in a\r\nNorthwardly direction from its entrance, distant about 30 miles. the\r\nair is so pure in this open country that mountains and other elivated\r\nobjects appear much nearer than they really are; these mountains do not\r\nappear to be further than 15 m. we sent a man up this creek to explore\r\nthe country he returned late in the evening and informed that he had\r\nproceeded ten miles directly towards these mountains and that he did\r\nnot think himself by any mean half way these mountains are rockey and\r\ncovered with some scattering pine. This stream we call North Mountain\r\ncreek. the next stream in order is a creek which falls in on Lard. 21/2\r\nmiles higher; this is 15 yds. wide no water; a large village of the\r\nburrowing or barking squirrels on the Stard. side opposite it's\r\nentrance, hence the name Little dog Ck. that being the name by which\r\nthe French Engages call this anamal. at three miles and at 10 ms. from\r\nhence still ascending 2 Small creek fall in on the Stard. side, no\r\nwater. 51/2 miles higher a small river falls in on Lard. side this we\r\ncalled South Mountain creek as from it's direction it appeared to take\r\nit's rise in a range of Mountains lying in a S. Westerly direction from\r\nit's entrance distant 50 or 60 m.; this creek is 40 yards wide and\r\ndischarges a handsome stream of water. it's bed is rockey with gravel\r\nand sand, the banks high and country broken it's bottom narrow and no\r\ntimber. The country high and broken, a considerable portion of black\r\nrock and brown sandy rock appear in the faces of the hills; the tops of\r\nthe hills covered with scattering pine spruce and dwarf cedar; the soil\r\npoor and sterile, sandy near the tops of the hills, the whole producing\r\nbut little grass; the narrow bottoms of the Missouri producing little\r\nelse but Hysop or southern wood and the pulpy leafed thorn. Capt. Clark\r\nwalked on shore this evening and killed a buffaloe cow, we left 2\r\nCanoes and six men to dress the Cow and bring on the meat, they did not\r\novertake us this evening. game is becoming more scarce, particularly\r\nbeaver, of which we have seen but few for several days the beaver\r\nappears to keep pace with the timber as it declines in quantity they\r\nalso become more scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 24, 1805]\r\nMay 24th Friday 1805\r\na Cold night the water in the Small vestles frosed 1/8 of an inch\r\nthick, and the thermometer Stood this morning at the freesing point. we\r\nSet out at an early hour and proceeded on, at 9 oClock we had a Breeze\r\nfrom the S E which Continued all day.

Clark and Bratton who were on shore\r\neach killed one of these anamals this evening. The head and horns of\r\nthe male which Drewyer killed weighed 27 lbs. it was somewhat larger\r\nthan the male of the common deer, the boddy reather thicker deeper and\r\nnot so long in proportion to it's hight as the common deer; the head\r\nand horns are remakably large compared with the other part of the\r\nanamal; the whole form is much more delicate than that of the common\r\ngoat, and there is a greater disparity in the size of the male and\r\nfemale than between those of either the deer or goat. the eye is large\r\nand prominant, the puple of a deep sea green and small, the iris of a\r\nsilvery colour much like the common sheep; the bone above the eye is\r\nremarkably prominant; the head nostrils and division of the upper lip\r\nare precisely in form like the sheep. there legs resemble the sheep\r\nmore than any other animal with which I am acquainted tho they are more\r\ndelicately formed, like the sheep they stand forward in the knee and\r\nthe lower joint of the foreleg is smallest where it joins the knee, the\r\nhoof is black & large in proportion, is divided, very open and roundly\r\npointed at the toe, like the sheep; is much hollowed and sharp on the\r\nunder edge like the Scotch goat, has two small hoofs behind each foot\r\nbelow the ankle as the goat sheep and deer have. the belley, inside of\r\nthe legs, and the extremity of the rump and butocks for about two\r\ninches arround the but of the tale, are white, as is also the tale\r\nexcet just at it's extremity on the upper side which is of a dark\r\nbrown. the tail is about three inches in length covered with short\r\nhair, or at least not longer than that of the boddy; the outher parts\r\nof the anamal are of a duskey brown or reather a leadcoloured light\r\nbrown; the anamal is now sheding it's winter coat which is thick not\r\nquite as long as that of the deer and appears to be intermixed with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of a fine fur which lyes next to the skin &\r\nconceald by the coarcer hear; the shape of the hair itself is celindric\r\nas that of the antelope is but is smaller shorter, and not compressed\r\nor flattened as that of the deer's winter coat is, I believe this\r\nanamal only sheds it's hair once a year. it has eight fore teeth in the\r\nunder jaw and no canine teeth. The horns are lagest at their base, and\r\noccupy the crown of the head almost entirely. they are compressed, bent\r\nbackwards and lunated; the surface swelling into wavy rings which\r\nincircleing the horn continue to succeed each other from the base to\r\nthe extremity and becoming less elivated and more distant as they\r\nrecede from the head. the horn for about two thirds of it's length is\r\nfilled with a porus bone which is united with the frontal bone. I\r\nobtained the bones of the upper part of the head of this animal at the\r\nbig bone lick. the horns of the female are small, but are also compress\r\nbent backwards and incircled with a succession of wavy rings. the horn\r\nis of a light brown colour; when dressed it is almost white extreemly\r\ntransparent and very elastic. this horn is used by the natives in\r\nconstructing their bows; I have no doubt but it would eligant and\r\nucefull hair combs, and might probably answer as many valuable purposes\r\nto civilized man, as it dose to the savages, who form their watercups\r\nspoons and platters of it. the females have already brought forth their\r\nyoung indeed from the size of the young I suppose that they produce\r\nthem early in March. they have from one to two at a birth. they feed on\r\ngrass but principally on the arromatic herbs which grow on the clifts\r\nand inaccessable hights which they usually frequent. the places they\r\ngerally celect to lodg is the cranies or cevices of the rocks in the\r\nfaces of inacessable precepices, where the wolf nor bear can reach them\r\nand where indeed man himself would in many instancies find a similar\r\ndeficiency; yet these anamals bound from rock to rock and stand\r\napparently in the most careless manner on the sides of precipices of\r\nmany hundred feet. they are very shye and are quick of both sent and\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of two 3/4 miles above our encampment of last evening\r\nwe passed a Creek 20 yard wide affording no runing water, we also\r\npassed 7 Islands in the course of the day. The Country on either hand\r\nis high broken and rockey; the rock is either soft brown sand stone\r\ncovered with a thin strata of limestone, or a hard black rugged\r\ngrannite, both usually in horizontal stratas and the Sandy rock\r\noverlaying the other.--Salts and quarts still appear, some coal and\r\npumice stone also appear; the river bottoms are narrow and afford\r\nscarcely any timber. the bars of the river are composed principally of\r\ngravel, but little pine on the hills. We saw a Pole-cats this evening\r\nit is the first we have seen for many days. buffalow are now scarce and\r\nI begin to fear our harvest of white puddings are at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 25, 1805]\r\nMay 25th Satturday 1805\"\r\nThe two Canoes left for meat yesterday did not joint us untill 8 oClock\r\nthis morning at which time we Set out, the morning Cool & pleasent wind\r\na head all day from the S. W. we pass a Creek on the Lard. Side about\r\n20 yards wide, which does not run, we also passd 7 Islands, I walked on\r\nShore and killed a female Ibex or big horn animal in my absence Drewyer\r\n& Bratten killed two others, this animale is a species peculiar to this\r\nupper part of the Missouri, the head and horns of the male which\r\nDrewyer killed to day weighed 27 lbs it was Somewhat larger than the\r\nMail of the Common Deer;) The body reather thicker deeper and not So\r\nlong in proportion to its hight as the common Deer; the head and horns\r\nof the male are remarkably large Compared with the other parts of the\r\nanimal; the whole form is much more delicate than that of the common\r\ngoat, and there is a greater disparity in the Size of the mail and\r\nfemale than between those of either the deer or goat. the eye is large\r\nand prominant, the puple of a deep Sea green and Small, the iris of a\r\nSilvery Colour much like the common Sheep; the bone above the Eye is\r\nremarkably prominant; the head nostrils and division of the upper lip\r\nare precisely in form like the Sheep. their legs resemble the Sheep\r\nmore than any other animal with which I am acquainted tho they are more\r\ndelicately formed, like the Sheep they stand foward in the Knee and the\r\nlower joint of the fore leg is Smallest where it joins the Knee, the\r\nhoof is black and large in perpotion, is divided, very open and roundly\r\npointed at the toe; like the Sheep; is much hollowed and Sharp on the\r\nunder edge like the Scotch goat, has two Small Hoofs behind each foot\r\nbelow the ankle as the goat Sheep and Deer have. the belley, iner Side\r\nof the legs, and the extremity of the rump and buttocks for about two\r\ninches 1/2 around the but of the tail, are white, as is also the tail\r\nexcept just at its extremity on the upper Side which is of a dark\r\nbrown. the tail is about 3 inches in length covered with Short hair, or\r\nat least not longer than that of the boddy; the outer part of the\r\nanimal are of a duskey brown or reather a lead coloured light brown;\r\nthe animal is now Sheding its winter coat which is thick not quite as\r\nlong as that of the Deer and appears to be inter mixt with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fine fur which lies next to the Skin and\r\nconcealed by the Coarcer hair; the Shape of the hair itself is\r\ncylindric as that of the Antilope is, but is Smaller, Shorter and not\r\nCompressed or flattened as that of the deers winter Coat is. I believe\r\nthis animal only Sheds it's hair once a year. it has Eight fore teeth\r\nin the underjaw and no canine teeth. The Horns are large at their base,\r\nand occupy the Crown of the head almost entirely, they are compressed,\r\nbent backwards and lunated; the Surface Swelling into wavey rings which\r\nincircleing the horn continue to Succeed each other from the base to\r\nthe extremity and becomeing less elivated and more distant as they\r\nreceed from the head. The horn for about two thirds of its length is\r\nfilled with a porus bone which is united with the frontal bone (Capt.\r\nLewis obtained the bones of the upper part of the head of this Animal\r\nat the big Bone Lick in the State of Kentucky which I Saw and find to\r\nbe the Same in every respect with those of the Missouri and the Rockey\r\nMountains) the horns of the female are Small, but are also compressed\r\nand bent backwards and incircled with a Succession of wavy rings. the\r\nhorn is of a light brown Colour; when Dressed it is almost white\r\nextreamly transparent and very elastic. this horn is used by the nativs\r\nin constructing their bows; I have no doubt of it's elegance and\r\nusefullness in hair Combs, and might probably answer as maney valuable\r\npurpoces to civilized man, as it does to the native indians, who form\r\ntheir water Cups, Spoons and platters of it. the females have already\r\nbrought forth their young indeed from the Size of the young, I Suppose\r\nthat they produce them early in March. they have from one to two at a\r\nbirth. they feed on grass, but principally on the arramatic herbs which\r\ngrow on the Clifts and inaccessable hights which they frequent most\r\ncommonly, and the places they generally collect to lodge is the Cranies\r\nor Cevices of the rocks in the face of inaccessable precepices, where\r\nthe wolf nor Bear Can reach them, and where indeed man himself would in\r\nmaney instances find a Similar deficiency; yet those animals bound from\r\nrock to rock and Stand apparently in the most Careless manner on the\r\nSide of precipices of maney hundred feet. they are very Shy and quick\r\nof both Sent and Sight. The flesh of this animal is dark and I think\r\ninferior to the flesh of the Common Deer, and Superior to the antilope\r\nof the Missouri and the Columbian Plains-. In my walk of this day I saw\r\nmountts. on either side of the river at no great distance, those\r\nmountains appeared to be detached, and not ranges as laid down by the\r\nMinetarrees, I also think I saw a range of high mounts. at a great\r\ndistance to the S S W. but am not certain as the horozon was not clear\r\nenough to view it with Certainty. The country on either side is high\r\nbroken and rockey a dark brown hard rugid Stone intermixed with a Soft\r\nwhite Sand Stone. the hills contain Coal or cabonated wood as below and\r\nSome Scattering pumistone. the Sides of the river is bordered with\r\ncoars gravel, which in maney places have washed either together or down\r\nSmall brooks and forms bars at Some distance in the water, around which\r\nthe current passes with great valocity. the bottoms between hills and\r\nriver are narrow and Contain Scercely any timber. The appearence of\r\nSalts, and bitumun Still Continue. we Saw a polecat to day being the\r\nfirst which we have Seen for Some time past. The Air of this quarter is\r\npure and helthy. the water of the Missouri well tasted not quite So\r\nmuddy as it is below, not withstanding the last rains has raised the\r\nriver a little it is less muddy than it was before the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 26, 1805]\r\nSunday May 26th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour and proceeded principally by the toe line,\r\nusing the oars mearly to pass the river in order to take advantage of\r\nthe shores. scarcely any bottoms to the river; the hills high and\r\njuting in on both sides, to the river in many places. the stone\r\ntumbleing from these clifts and brought down by the rivulets as\r\nmentioned yesterday became more troublesome today. the black rock has\r\ngiven place to a very soft sandstone which appears to be washed away\r\nfast by the river, above this and towards the summits of the hills a\r\nhard freestone of a brownish yellow colour shews itself in several\r\nstratas of unequal thicknesses frequently overlain or incrusted by a\r\nvery thin strata of limestone which appears to be formed of concreted\r\nshells. Capt. Clark walked on shore this morning and ascended to the\r\nsummit of the river hills he informed me on his return that he had seen\r\nmountains on both sides of the river runing nearly parrallel with it\r\nand at no great distance; also an irregular range of mountains on lard.\r\nabout 50 mes. distant, the extremities of which boar W and N. W. from\r\nhis station. he also saw in the course of his walk, some Elk, several\r\nherds of the Big horn, and the large hare; the latter is common to\r\nevery part of this open country. scarcely any timber to be seen except\r\nthe few scattering pine and spruce which crown the high hills, or in\r\nsome instances grow along their sides. In the after part of the day I\r\nalso walked out and ascended the river hills which I found sufficiently\r\nfortiegueing. on arriving to the summit one of the highest points in\r\nthe neighbourhood I thought myself well repaid for any labour; as from\r\nthis point I beheld the Rocky Mountains for the first time, I could\r\nonly discover a few of the most elivated points above the horizon, the\r\nmost remarkable of which by my pocket compass I found bore N. 65° W.\r\nbeing a little to the N. of the N. W. extremity of the range of broken\r\nmountains seen this morning by Capt. C. these points of the Rocky\r\nMountains were covered with snow and the sun shone on it in such manner\r\nas to give me the most plain and satisfactory view. while I viewed\r\nthese mountains I felt a secret pleasure in finding myself so near the\r\nhead of the heretofore conceived boundless Missouri; but when I\r\nreflected on the difficulties which this snowey barrier would most\r\nprobably throw in my way to the Pacific, and the sufferings and\r\nhardships of myself and party in them, it in some measure\r\ncounterballanced the joy I had felt in the first moments in which I\r\ngazed on them; but as I have always held it a crime to anticipate evils\r\nI will believe it a good comfortable road untill I am compelled to\r\nbeleive differently. saw a few Elk & bighorns at a distance on my\r\nreturn to the river I passed a creek about 20 yds. wide near it's\r\nentrance it had a handsome little stream of runing water; in this creek\r\nI saw several softshelled Turtles which were the first that have been\r\nseen this season; this I believe proceeded reather from the season than\r\nfrom their non existence in the portion of the river from the Mandans\r\nhither. on the Stard. shore I killed a fat buffaloe which was very\r\nacceptable to us at this moment; the party came up to me late in the\r\nevening and encamped for the night on the Lard. side. it was after dark\r\nbefore we finished butchering the buffaloe, and on my return to camp I\r\ntrod within five inches of a rattle snake but being in motion I passed\r\nbefore he could probably put himself in a striking attitude and\r\nfortunately escaped his bite, I struck about at random with my\r\nespontoon being directed in some measure by his nois untill I killed\r\nhim. Our hunters had killed two of the Bighorned Anamals since I had\r\nleft them. we also passed another creek a few miles below Turtle Creek\r\non the Stard. 30 yds in width which also had runing water bed rockey.-\r\nlate this evening we passed a very bad rappid which reached quite\r\nacross the river, the party had considerable difficulty in ascending it\r\naltho they doubled their crews and used both the rope and the pole.\r\nwhile they were passing this rappid a female Elk and it's fawn swam\r\ndown throught the waves which ran very high, hence the name of Elk\r\nrappids which they instantly gave this place, these are the most\r\nconsiderable rappids which we have yet seen on the missouri and in\r\nshort the only place where there has appeared to be a suddon decent.\r\nopposite to these rappids there is a high bluff and a little above on\r\nLard. a small cottonwood bottom in which we found sufficient timber for\r\nour fires and encampment. here I rejoined the party after dark. The\r\nappearances of coal in the face of the bluffs, also of birnt hills,\r\npumice stone salt and quarts continue as yesterday. This is truly a\r\ndesert barren country and I feel myself still more convinced of it's\r\nbeing a continuation of the black hills. we have continued every day to\r\npass more or less old stick lodges of the Indians in the timbered\r\npoints, there are two even in this little bottom where we lye.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 26, 1805]\r\nMay 26th Sunday 1805\r\nWe Set out early and proceeded as yesterday wind from the S. W. the\r\nriver enclosed with very high hills on either Side. I took one man and\r\nwalked out this morning, and ascended the high countrey to view the\r\nmountains which I thought I Saw yesterday, from the first Sumit of the\r\nhill I could plainly See the Mountains on either Side which I Saw\r\nyesterday and at no great distance from me, those on the Stard Side is\r\nan errigular range, the two extremities of which bore West and N. West\r\nfrom me. those Mountains on the Lard. Side appeared to be Several\r\ndetached Knobs or mountains riseing from a leven open Countrey, at\r\ndifferent distances from me, from South West to South East, on one the\r\nmost S. Westerly of those Mountains there appeared to be Snow. I\r\ncrossed a Deep holler and assended a part of the plain elevated much\r\nhigher than where I first viewed the above mountains; from this point I\r\nbeheld the Rocky Mountains for the first time with Certainty, I could\r\nonly discover a fiew of the most elivated points above the horizon. the\r\nmost remarkable of which by my pocket Compas I found bore S. 60 W.\r\nthose points of the rocky Mountain were Covered with Snow and the Sun\r\nShown on it in Such a manner as to give me a most plain and\r\nSatisfactory view. whilst I viewed those mountains I felt a Secret\r\npleasure in finding myself So near the head of the heretofore Conceived\r\nboundless Missouri; but when I reflected on the difficulties which this\r\nSnowey barrier would most probably throw in my way to the Pacific\r\nOcean, and the Sufferings and hardships of my Self and party in them,\r\nit in Some measure Counter ballanced the joy I had felt in the first\r\nmoments in which I gazed on them; but as I have always held it little\r\nShort of Criminality to anticipate evils I will allow it to be a good\r\nComfortable road untill I am Compelled to believe otherwise The high\r\nCountry in which we are at present and have been passing for Some days\r\nI take to be a continuation of what the Indians as well as the French\r\nEngages call the Black hills. This tract of Country So Called Consists\r\nof a Collection of high broken and irregular hills and Short Chains of\r\nMountains, sometimes 100 miles in width and again becoming much\r\nnarrower, but always much higher than the Country on either Side; they\r\ncommence about the head of the Kanzas river and to the west of that\r\nriver near the Arkansaw river, from whence they take their Cource a\r\nlittle to the west of N. W. approaching the Rocky Mountains obliquely\r\npassing the river Platt near the forks, and intersepting the River\r\nRochejhone near the big bend of that river, and passing the Missouri at\r\nthis place-, and probably Continueing to Swell the Country as far North\r\nas the Saskashawan river. tho they are lower here than they are\r\ndiscribed to the South and may therefore termonate before they reach\r\nthe Saskashawan. the Black hills in their Course northerly appear to\r\napproach more nearly the Rocky Mountains. I Saw a great number of white\r\nbrant, also the common brown brant, Geese of the common Size & kind and\r\na Small Species of geese, which differs considerably from the Common or\r\nCanadian Goose; their necks, head and backs are considerably thicker,\r\nShorter and larger than the other in propotion to its Size they are\r\nalso more than a third Smaller, and their note more like that of the\r\nbrant or young goose which has not perfectly acquired his note, in all\r\nother respect they are the Same in Colour habits and the number of\r\nfeathers in the tail, they frequently also ascocate with the large\r\nGeese when in flocks, but never Saw them pared off with the larger or\r\ncommon goose. The white Brant ascocates in very large flocks, they do\r\nnot appear to be mated or pared off as if they intended to raise their\r\nyoung in this quarter, I therefore doubt whether they reside here\r\ndureing the Summer for that purpose. this bird is larger than the\r\nCommon brown brant or 2/3 of the common goose. it is not So long by Six\r\ninches from point to point of the wings when extended as the other; the\r\nback head and neck are also larger and Stronger; their beak, legs and\r\nfeet are of a redish flesh coloured white. the eye of a moderate Size,\r\nthe puple of a deep Sea green encircled with a ring of yellowish brown.\r\nit has 16 feathers of equal length in the tail their note differs but\r\nlittle from the Common brant. they are of a pure white except the large\r\nfeathers of the 1st and 2d joint of the wings which are jut black.\r\n\r\nThe country which borders the river is high broken and rocky, generally\r\nimbeded with a Soft Sand Stone higher up the hill the Stone is of a\r\nbrownish yellow hard and gritty those Stones wash down from the hills\r\ninto the river and cause the Shore to be rocky &c. which we find\r\ntroublesom to assend there is Scerce any bottom between the Hills &\r\nriver and but a fiew trees to be Seen on either Side except Scattering\r\npine on the Sides of the emence hills; we passed 2 Creeks on the Stard\r\nSide both of them had running water in one of those Creek Capt Lewis\r\ntells me he saw Soft Shell Turtle Capt Lewis in his walk killed a fat\r\nBuffalow which we were in want of our hunters killed 2 Mountain rams or\r\nbighorns in the evening late we passed a rapid which extended quite\r\nacross the river we assended it by the assistance of a Cord & poles on\r\nthe Lard. Side the Cliffs jut over, the opposit Side is a Small leavel\r\nbottom, we Camped a little above in a Small grove of Cotton trees on\r\nthe Lard. Side in the rapid we saw a Dow Elk & her faun, which gave\r\nrise to the name of Elk & faun Riffle we had a few drops of rain at\r\nDark.--the Salts Coal & Burnt hills & Pumicston Still Continue, game\r\nScerce this Countrey may with propriety I think be termed the Deserts\r\nof America, as I do not Conceive any part can ever be Settled, as it is\r\ndeficent in water, Timber & too Steep to be tilled. We pass old Indian\r\nlodges in the woody points everry day & 2 at our camp &c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 26, 1805]\r\nMay 26, 1805.\r\nOne of the party killed a bighorned, the head and horns of which\r\nweighed 27 lbs. a hare was also killed which weighed 81/2 lbs. the hare\r\nare now of a plale lead brown colour-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 27, 1805]\r\nMonday May 27th 1805.\r\nThe wind blew so hard this morning that we did not sent out untill 10\r\nA.M. we employed the chord most of the day; the river becomes more\r\nrappid and is intercepted by shoals and a greater number of rocky\r\npoints at the mouths of the little gulies than we experienced\r\nyesterday. the bluffs are very high steep rugged, containing\r\nconsiderable quantities of stone and border the river closely on both\r\nsides; once perhaps in the course of several miles there will be a few\r\nacres of tolerably level land in which two or thre impoverished\r\ncottonwood trees will be seen. great quantities of stone also lye in\r\nthe river and garnish it's borders, which appears to have tumbled from\r\nthe bluffs where the rains had washed away the sand and clay in which\r\nthey were imbeded. the bluffs are composed of irregular tho horizontal\r\nstratas of yellow and brown or black clay, brown and yellowish white\r\nsand, of soft yellowish white sand stone and a hard dark brown free\r\nstone, also of large round kidneyformed and irregular seperate masses\r\nof a hard black Iron stone, which is imbeded in the Clay and sand. some\r\nlittle pine spruce and dwarf cedar on the hills. some coal or\r\ncarbonated wood still makes it's appearance in these bluffs,\r\npumicestone and birnt hills it's concommutants also are seen. the salts\r\nand quarts are seen but not in such abundance. the country more broken\r\nand barren than yesterday if possible. about midday it was very warm to\r\nthis the high bluffs and narrow channel of the river no doubt\r\ncontributed greatly. we passed a small untimbered Island this morning\r\non the Lard. side of the river just above our encampment of last\r\nevening. saw a few small herds of the Bighorned anamals and two Elk\r\nonly, of the last we killed one, the river is generally about 200 yds.\r\nwide, very rappid and has a perceptable fall or declination through\r\nit's whole course.\r\n\r\nThis evening we encamped, for the benefit of wood, near two dead toped\r\ncottonwood trees on the Lard. side; the dead limbs which had fallen\r\nfrom these trees furnished us with a scanty supply only, and more was\r\nnot to be obtained in the neighbourhood.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 27, 1805]\r\nMay 27th Monday 1805.\r\nThe wind blew hard from the S W. which detained us untill about 10\r\noClock, at which time we Set out and proceeded on, passed a Small\r\nnacked Island on the Lard Side imediately above the timber in which we\r\nCamped The river is verry Shoaley and the bad places are verry\r\nnumerous, i e at the mouth of every Drean the rocks which is a hard\r\ndark gritey Stone is thrown out Some distance in the river which Cause\r\na Considerable riffle on that Side, the hills approach the river verry\r\nClose on either Side, river narrow & no timber except Some Scattering\r\npine on the hills & hill Sides, the Salts, Coal, burn hills & Pumice\r\nStone &c. Continue, the hills are Generally Bluffs of various Coloured\r\nearth most commonly black with different quallities stone intermixed\r\nSome Stratums of Soft Sand Stone, Some hard, Some a dark brown & yellow\r\nhard grit, those Stones are loosened by the earths washing from them\r\ninto the river and ultimately role down into the river, which appears\r\nto be Crowded with them. This day is verry worm--we only Saw a fiew\r\nSmall herds of the big horn animals on the hills, and two Elk one of\r\nwhich We killed, we Camped at 2 dead top trees on the Lard Side. The\r\nriver is Genly about 200 yards wide and Current very Swift to day and\r\nhas a verry perceptiable fall in all its Course--it rises a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 28, 1805]\r\nTuesday May 28th 1805.\r\nThis morning we set forward at an early hour; the weather dark and\r\ncloudy, the are smokey, had a few drops of rain; we employed the chord\r\ngenerally to which we also gave the assistance of the pole at the\r\nriffles and rocky points; these are as numerous and many of them much\r\nworse than those we passed yesterday; arround those points the water\r\ndrives with great force, and we are obliged in many instaces to steer\r\nour vessels through the appertures formed by the points of large sharp\r\nrocks which reach a few inches above the surface of the water, here\r\nsould our chord give way the bough is instantly drivin outwards by the\r\nstream and the vessel thrown with her side on the rocks where she must\r\ninevitably overset or perhaps be dashed to peices; our ropes are but\r\nslender, all of them except one being made of Elk's skin and much\r\nwoarn, frequently wet and exposed to the heat of the weather are weak\r\nand rotten; they have given way several times in the course of the day\r\nbut happily at such places that the vessel had room to wheel free of\r\nthe rocks and therefore escaped injury; with every precaution we can\r\ntake it is with much labour and infinite risk that we are enabled to\r\nget around these points. found a new indian lodge pole today which had\r\nbeen brought down by the stream, it was woarn at one end as if draged\r\nby dogs or horses; a football also, and several other articles were\r\nfound, which have been recently brought down by the courant; these are\r\nstrong evedences of Indians being on the river above us, and probably\r\nat no great distance; the football is such as I have seen among the\r\nMinetaries and therefore think it most probable that they are a band of\r\nthe Minetaries of Fort de Prarie. the river country &c continued much\r\nas yesterday untill late in the evening when we arrived at the entrance\r\nof a large Creek discharges itself on the Stard. side, is 35 Yd. wide\r\nand contains runing water; here the hills recede from the river on both\r\nsides, the bottoms extensive particularly on the Stard. side where the\r\nhills are comparitively low and open into three large vallies which\r\nextend for a considerable distance in a Northwardly direction; here\r\nalso the river spreads to more than 3 times it's former width and is\r\nfilled with a number of small and handsome Islands covered with\r\ncottonwood some timber also in the bottoms, the land again fertile.\r\nThese appearances were quite reviving after the drairy country through\r\nwhich we had been passing. Capt. C. walked on shore in the early part\r\nof the day and killed a big horned anamal; he saw a great number of\r\nthem as well as ourselves in the broken country. at 10 A.M. a few drops\r\nof rain again fell and were attended with distant thunder which is the\r\nfirst we have heated since we left the Mandans.--This evening we\r\nencamped on Stard. opposite to the entrance of a small Creek. I beleive\r\nthe bighorn have their young at a very early season, say early in March\r\nfor they appear now to be half grown. One of the party saw a very large\r\nbear today but being some distance from the river and no timber to\r\nconceal him he did not think proper to fire on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 28, 1805]\r\nMay 28th Tuesday 1805\r\na Cloudy morning Some fiew drops of rain and verry Smokey wind from the\r\nS.

Side we call Bull Creek from the Circumstance of a Buffalow Bull\r\nswiming from the opposit Side and comeing out of the river imedeately\r\nacross one of the Perogues without Sinking or injureing any thing in\r\nthe Perogue, and passing with great violence thro our Camp in the night\r\nmakeing 3 angles without hurting a man, altho they lay in every\r\ndirection, and it was very dark The Creek below 35 yards wide I call\r\nThompsons Creek after a valuable member of our party--this Creek\r\ncontains a Greater preportion of running water than Common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 29, 1805]\r\nWednesday May 29th 1905.\r\nLast night we were all allarmed by a large buffaloe Bull, which swam\r\nover from the opposite shore and coming along side of the white\r\nperogue, climbed over it to land, he then alarmed ran up the bank in\r\nfull speed directly towards the fires, and was within 18 inches of the\r\nheads of some of the men who lay sleeping before the centinel could\r\nallarm him or make him change his course, still more alarmed, he now\r\ntook his direction immediately towards our lodge, passing between 4\r\nfires and within a few inches of the heads of one range of the men as\r\nthey yet lay sleeping, when he came near the tent, my dog saved us by\r\ncausing him to change his course a second time, which he did by turning\r\na little to the right, and was quickly out of sight, leaving us by this\r\ntime all in an uproar with our guns in or hands, enquiring of each\r\nother the case of the alarm, which after a few moments was explained by\r\nthe centinel; we were happy to find no one hirt. The next morning we\r\nfound that the buffaloe in passing the perogue had trodden on a rifle,\r\nwhich belonged to Capt. Clark's black man, who had negligently left her\r\nin the perogue, the rifle was much bent, he had also broken the\r\nspindle, pivit, and shattered the stock of one of the bluntderbushes on\r\nboard, with this damage I felt well content, happey indeed, that we had\r\nsustaned no further injury. it appears that the white perogue, which\r\ncontains our most valuable stores, is attended by some evil gennii.\r\nThis morning we set out at an early hour and proceded as usual by the\r\nChord. at the distance of 21/2 miles passed a handsome river which\r\ndischarged itself on the Lard. side, I walked on shore and acended this\r\nriver about a mile and a half in order to examine it. I found this\r\nriver about 100 yds. wide from bank to bank, the water occupying about\r\n75 yard. the bed was formed of gravel and mud with some sand; it\r\nappeared to contain much more water as the Muscle-Shell river, was more\r\nrappid but equally navigable; there were no large stone or rocks in\r\nit's bed to obstruct the navigation; the banks were low yet appeared\r\nseldom to overflow; the water of this River is Clear than any we have\r\nmet with great abundance of the Argalia or Bighorned animals in the\r\nhigh country through which this river passes Cap. C who assended this\r\nR. much higher than I did has thought proper to call it Judieths River.\r\nThe bottoms of this stream as far as I could see were wider and\r\ncontained more timber than the Missouri; here I saw some box alder\r\nintermixed with the Cottonwood willow rose bushes and honeysuckle with\r\nsome red willow constitute the undergrowth. on the Missouri just above\r\nthe entrance of the Big Horn River I counted the remains of the fires\r\nof 126 Indian lodges which appeared to be of very recent date perhaps\r\n12 or 15 days. Capt. Clark also saw a large encampent just above the\r\nentrance of this river on the Stard. side of reather older date,\r\nprobably they were the same Indians. The Indian woman with us exmined\r\nthe mockersons which we found at these encampments and informed us that\r\nthey were not of her nation the Snake Indians, but she beleived they\r\nwere some of the Indians who inhabit the country on this side of Rocky\r\nMountains and North of the Missoury and I think it most probable that\r\nthey were the Minetaries of Fort de Prarie. At the distance of six 1/2\r\nms. from our encampment of last night we passed a very bad rappid to\r\nwhich we gave the name of the Ash rappid from a few trees of that wood\r\ngrowing near them; this is the first ash I have seen for a great\r\ndistance. at this place the hills again approach the river closely on\r\nboth sides, and the same seen which we had on the 27th and 28th in the\r\nmorning again presents itself, and the rocky points and riffles reather\r\nmore numerous and worse; there was but little timber; salts coal &c\r\nstill appear. today we passed on the Stard. side the remains of a vast\r\nmany mangled carcases of Buffalow which had been driven over a\r\nprecipice of 120 feet by the Indians and perished; the water appeared\r\nto have washed away a part of this immence pile of slaughter and still\r\ntheir remained the fragments of at least a hundred carcases they\r\ncreated a most horrid stench. in this manner the Indians of the\r\nMissouri distroy vast herds of buffaloe at a stroke; for this purpose\r\none of the most active and fleet young men is scelected and disguised\r\nin a robe of buffaloe skin, having also the skin of the buffaloe's head\r\nwith the years and horns fastened on his head in form of a cap, thus\r\ncaparisoned he places himself at a convenient distance between a herd\r\nof buffaloe and a precipice proper for the purpose, which happens in\r\nmany places on this river for miles together; the other indians now\r\nsurround the herd on the back and flanks and at a signal agreed on all\r\nshew themselves at the same time moving forward towards the buffaloe;\r\nthe disguised indian or decoy has taken care to place himself\r\nsufficiently nigh the buffaloe to be noticed by them when they take to\r\nflight and runing before them they follow him in full speede to the\r\nprecepice, the cattle behind driving those in front over and seeing\r\nthem go do not look or hesitate about following untill the whole are\r\nprecipitated down the precepice forming one common mass of dead an\r\nmangled carcases; the decoy in the mean time has taken care to secure\r\nhimself in some cranney or crivice of the clift which he had previously\r\nprepared for that purpose. the part of the decoy I am informed is\r\nextreamly dangerous, if they are not very fleet runers the buffaloe\r\ntread them under foot and crush them to death, and sometimes drive them\r\nover the precepice also, where they perish in common with the\r\nbuffaloe.--we saw a great many wolves in the neighbourhood of these\r\nmangled carcases they were fat and extreemly gentle, Capt. C. who was\r\non shore killed one of them with his espontoon. just above this place\r\nwe came too for dinner opposite the entrance of a bold runing river 40\r\nyds. wide which falls in on Lard. side. this stream we called slaughter\r\nriver. it's bottoms are but narrow and contain scarcely any timber. our\r\nsituation was a narrow bottom on the Stard. possessing some cottonwood.\r\nsoon after we landed it began to blow & rain, and as there was no\r\nappearance of even wood enough to make our fires for some distance\r\nabove we determined to remain here untill the next morning, and\r\naccordingly fixed our camp and gave each man a small dram.\r\nnotwithstanding the allowance of sperits we issued did not exceed 1/2\r\npn. man several of them were considerably effected by it; such is the\r\neffects of abstaining for some time from the uce of sperituous liquors;\r\nthey were all very merry.--The hunters killed an Elk this evening, and\r\nCapt. C. killed two beaver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 29, 1805]\r\nMay 29th Wednesday 1805\r\nIn the last night we were alarmed by a Buffalow which Swam from the\r\nopposit Shore landed opposit the Perogue in which Capt Lewis & my Self\r\nwere in he Crossed the perogue, and went with great force up to the\r\nfire where Several men were Sleeping and was 18 inches of their heads,\r\nwhen one man Sitting up allarmed him and he turned his course along the\r\nrange of men as they lay, passing between 4 fires and within a fiew\r\nInches of Some of the mens heads as they lay imediately in a direction\r\nto our lodge about which Several men were lying. our Dog flew out & he\r\nchanged his course & passed without doeing more damage than bend a\r\nrifle & brakeing hir Stock and injureying one of the blunder busts in\r\nthe perogue as he passed through--We Set out this morning at the usial\r\nhour & proceeded on at 21/2 miles passed the mouth of a river ____\r\nyards wide, discharging a great quantity of water, and Containing more\r\nwood in its bottoms than the Missouri--this river Capt Lewis walked up\r\nfor a Short distance & he Saw an old encampment of Indians (I also saw\r\nlarge encampment on the Stard Side at the mouth of a Small Creek of\r\nabout 100 Lodges which appeared to be 5 or 6 weeks past, the Indian\r\nwoman examined the mockersons &c. and told us they were the Indians\r\nwhich resided below the rocky mountains & to the North of this\r\nriver,that her nation make their mockersons differently) at 61/2 miles\r\npassed a considerable rapid at which place the hills approach near the\r\nriver on both Sides, leaveing a narrow bottom on the Stard. Side, (ash\r\nrapid) and continue Close all day but little timber, I walked on the\r\nbank in the evening and saw the remains of a number of buffalow, which\r\nhad been drove down a Clift of rocks I think from appearances that\r\nupwards of 100 of those animals must have perished here, Great numbers\r\nof wolves were about this place & verry jentle I killed one of them\r\nwith my Spear. The hills above ash rapid Contains more rock and Coal,\r\nand the more rapid points. we Came too for Dinner opposit the enterence\r\nof a Small river which falls in on the Lard Side and is about ____\r\nyards wide, has a bold running Stream, Soon after we Came too it began\r\nto rain & blow hard, and as we were in a good harbor & Small point of\r\nwoods on the Stard Side, and no timber for some distance above, induced\r\nus to conclude to Stay all night. we gave the men a dram, altho verry\r\nSmall it was Sufficent to effect Several men. one of our hunters killed\r\nan elk this evening--I killed 2 beaver on the Side of the bank a table\r\nSpoon full of water exposed to the air in a Saucer would avaperate in\r\n36 hours when the mercury did not Stand higher than the temperate point\r\nin the heat of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 30, 1805]\r\nThursday May 30th 1805.\r\nThe rain which commenced last evening continued with little\r\nintermission untill 11this morning when we set out; the high wind which\r\naccompanied the rain rendered it impracticable to procede earlyer. more\r\nrain has now fallen than we have experienced since the 15th of\r\nSeptember last. many circumstances indicate our near approach to a\r\ncountry whos climate differs considerably from that in which we have\r\nbeen for many months. the air of the open country is asstonishingly dry\r\nas well as pure. I found by several experiments that a table spoon full\r\nof water exposed to the air in a saucer would avaporate in 36 hours\r\nwhen the murcury did not stand higher than the temperate point at the\r\ngreatest heat of the day; my inkstand so frequently becoming dry put me\r\non this experiment. I also observed the well seasoned case of my\r\nsextant shrunk considerably and the joints opened. The water of the\r\nriver still continues to become clearer and notwithstanding the rain\r\nwhich has fallen it is still much clearer than it was a few days past.\r\nthis day we proceded with more labour and difficulty than we have yet\r\nexperienced; in addition to the imbarrasments of the rappid courant,\r\nriffles, & rockey point which were as bad if not worse than yesterday,\r\nthe banks and sides of the bluff were more steep than usual and were\r\nnow rendered so slippery by the late rain that the men could scarcely\r\nwalk. the chord is our only dependance for the courant is too rappid to\r\nbe resisted with the oar and the river too deep in most places for the\r\npole. the earth and stone also falling from these immence high bluffs\r\nrender it dangerous to pass under them. the wind was also hard and\r\nagainst us. our chords broke several times today but happily without\r\ninjury to the vessels. we had slight showers of rain through the course\r\nof the day, the air was could and rendered more disagreeable by the\r\nrain. one of the party ascended the river hills and reported on his\r\nreturn that there was snow intermixed with the rain which fell on the\r\nhights; he also informed us that the country was level a little back\r\nfrom the river on both sides. there is now no timber on the hills, an\r\nonly a few scattering cottonwood, ash, box Alder and willows to be seen\r\nalong the river. in the course of the day we passed several old\r\nencampment of Indians, from the apparent dates of which we conceived\r\nthat they were the several encampments of a band of about 100 lodges\r\nwho were progressing slowly up the river; the most recent appeared to\r\nhave been evacuated about 5 weeks since. these we supposed to be the\r\nMinetares or black foot Indians who inhabit the country watered by the\r\nSuskashawan and who resort to the establishment of Fort de Prarie, no\r\npart of the Missouri from the Minetaries to this place furnishes a\r\nperminent residence for any nation yet there is no part of it but what\r\nexhibits appearances of being occasionally visited by some nation on\r\nhunting excurtions. The Minnetares of the Missoury we know extend their\r\nexcurtions on the S. side as high as the yellowstone river; the\r\nAssinniboins still higher on the N. side most probably as high as about\r\nPorcupine river and from thence upwards most probably as far as the\r\nmountains by the Minetares of Fort de Prarie and the Black Foot Indians\r\nwho inhabit the S. fork of the Suskashawan. I say the Missouri to the\r\nRocky mountains for I am convinced that it penetrates those mountains\r\nfor a considerable distance.--Two buffaloe killed this evening a little\r\nabove our encampment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 30, 1805]\r\nMay 30th Thursday 1805\r\nThe rain conmmenced yesterday evining, and continued moderately through\r\nthe course of the night, more rain has now fallin than we have\r\nexperienced Since the 15th of September last, the rain continued this\r\nmorning, and the wind too high for us to proceed, untill about 11\r\noClock at which time we Set out, and proceeded on with great labour, we\r\nwere obliged to make use of the Tow rope & the banks were So muddey &\r\nSlipery that the men could Scercely walk not with Standing we proceeded\r\non as well as we could wind hard from the N W. in attempting to assend\r\na rapid our toe Cord broke & we turned without injurey, those rapids or\r\nShoaley points are noumerous and dificuelt, one being at the mouth of\r\nevery drean Some little rain at times all day one man assended the high\r\nCountrey and it was raining & Snowing on those hills, the day has\r\nproved to be raw and Cold. Back from the river is tollerably leavel, no\r\ntimber of any kind on the hills, and only a fiew Scattering cotton\r\nwillow & ash near the river, much hard rock; & rich earth, the Small\r\nportion of rain which has fallen causes the rich earth as deep as is\r\nwet to Slip into the river or bottoms &c.\r\n\r\nwe discover in Several places old encampments of large bands of\r\nIndians, a fiew weeks past and appear to be makeing up the river--Those\r\nIndians we believe to be the Blackfoot Inds. or Menetares who inhabit\r\nthe heads of the Saskashowin & north of this place and trade a little\r\nin the Fort de Prarie establishments. we Camped in a grove of Cotton\r\ntrees on the Stard Side, river rise 11/2 In.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 31, 1805]\r\nFriday May 31st 1805.\r\nThis morning we proceeded at an early hour with the two perogues\r\nleaving the canoes and crews to bring on the meat of the two buffaloe\r\nthat were killed last evening and which had not been brought in as it\r\nwas late and a little off the river. soon after we got under way it\r\nbegan to rain and continued untill meridian when it ceased but still\r\nremained cloudy through the ballance of the day. The obstructions of\r\nrocky points and riffles still continue as yesterday; at those places\r\nthe men are compelled to be in the water even to their armpits, and the\r\nwater is yet very could, and so frequent are those point that they are\r\none fourth of their time in the water, added to this the banks and\r\nbluffs along which they are obliged to pass are so slippery and the mud\r\nso tenacious that they are unable to wear their mockersons, and in that\r\nsituation draging the heavy burthen of a canoe and walking ocasionally\r\nfor several hundred yards over the sharp fragments of rocks which\r\ntumble from the clifts and garnish the borders of the river; in short\r\ntheir labour is incredibly painfull and great, yet those faithfull\r\nfellows bear it without a murmur. The toe rope of the white perogue,\r\nthe only one indeed of hemp, and that on which we most depended, gave\r\nway today at a bad point, the perogue swung and but slightly touched a\r\nrock, yet was very near overseting; I fear her evil gennii will play so\r\nmany pranks with her that she will go to the bottomm some of those\r\ndays.--Capt. C. walked on shore this morning but found it so\r\nexcessively bad that he shortly returned. at 12 OCk. we came too for\r\nrefreshment and gave the men a dram which they received with much\r\ncheerfullness, and well deserved.\r\n\r\nThe hills and river Clifts which we passed today exhibit a most\r\nromantic appearance. The bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from\r\n2 to 300 feet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed\r\nof remarkable white sandstone which is sufficiently soft to give way\r\nreadily to the impression of water; two or thre thin horizontal stratas\r\nof white free-stone, on which the rains or water make no impression,\r\nlie imbeded in these clifts of soft stone near the upper part of them;\r\nthe earth on the top of these Clifts is a dark rich loam, which forming\r\na graduly ascending plain extends back from 1/2 a mile to a mile where\r\nthe hills commence and rise abruptly to a hight of about 300 feet more.\r\nThe water in the course of time in decending from those hills and\r\nplains on either side of the river has trickled down the soft sand\r\nclifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures, which with the\r\nhelp of a little immagination and an oblique view at a distance, are\r\nmade to represent eligant ranges of lofty freestone buildings, having\r\ntheir parapets well stocked with statuary; collumns of various\r\nsculpture both grooved and plain, are also seen supporting long\r\ngalleries in front of those buildings; in other places on a much nearer\r\napproach and with the help of less immagination we see the remains or\r\nruins of eligant buildings; some collumns standing and almost entire\r\nwith their pedestals and capitals; others retaining their pedestals but\r\ndeprived by time or accident of their capitals, some lying prostrate an\r\nbroken othes in the form of vast pyramids of connic structure bearing a\r\nsereis of other pyramids on their tops becoming less as they ascend and\r\nfinally terminating in a sharp point. nitches and alcoves of various\r\nforms and sizes are seen at different hights as we pass. a number of\r\nthe small martin which build their nests with clay in a globular form\r\nattatched to the wall within those nitches, and which were seen\r\nhovering about the tops of the collumns did not the less remind us of\r\nsome of those large stone buildings in the U States. the thin stratas\r\nof hard freestone intermixed with the soft sandstone seems to have\r\naided the water in forming this curious scenery. As we passed on it\r\nseemed as if those seens of visionary inchantment would never have and\r\nend; for here it is too that nature presents to the view of the\r\ntraveler vast ranges of walls of tolerable workmanship, so perfect\r\nindeed are those walls that I should have thought that nature had\r\nattempted here to rival the human art of masonry had I not recollected\r\nthat she had first began her work. These walls rise to the hight in\r\nmany places of 100 feet, are perpendicular, with two regular faces and\r\nare from one to 12 feet thick, each wall retains the same thickness at\r\ntop which it possesses at bottom. The stone of which these walls are\r\nformed is black, dence and dureable, and appears to be composed of a\r\nlarge portion of earth intermixed or cemented with a small quantity of\r\nsand and a considerable portion of talk or quarts. these stones are\r\nalmost invariably regular parallelepipeds, of unequal sizes in the\r\nwalls, but equal in their horizontal ranges, at least as to debth.\r\nthese are laid regularly in ranges on each other like bricks, each\r\nbreaking or covering the interstice of the two on which it rests. thus\r\nthe purpendicular interstices are broken, and the horizontal ones\r\nextend entire throughout the whole extent of the walls. These stones\r\nseem to bear some proportion to the thickness of the walls in which\r\nthey are employed, being larger in the thicker walls; the greatest\r\nlength of the parallelepiped appears to form the thickness of the\r\nthiner walls, while two or more are employed to form that of the\r\nthicker walls. These walls pass the river in several places, rising\r\nfrom the water's edge much above the sandstone bluffs, which they seem\r\nto penetrate; thence continuing their course on a streight line on\r\neither side of the river through the gradually ascending plains, over\r\nwhich they tower to the hight of from ten to seventy feet until) they\r\nreach the hills, which they finally enter and conceal themselves. these\r\nwalls sometimes run parallel to each other, with several ranges near\r\neach other, and at other times interscecting each other at right\r\nangles, having the appearance of the walls of ancient houses or\r\ngardens. I walked on shore this evening and examined these walls\r\nminutely and preserved a specimine of the stone. I found the face of\r\nmany of the river hills formed of Clifts of very excellent free stone\r\nof a light yellowish brown colour; on these clifts I met with a species\r\nof pine which I had never seen, it differs from the pitchpine in the\r\nparticular of it's leaf and cone, the first being vastly shorter, and\r\nthe latter considerably longer and more pointed. I saw near those\r\nbluffs the most beautiful) fox that I ever beheld, the colours appeared\r\nto me to be a fine orrange yellow, white and black, I endevoured to\r\nkill this anamal but it discovered me at a considerable distance, and\r\nfinding that I could get no nearer, I fired on him as he ran, and\r\nmissed him; he concealed himself under the rocks of the clift; it\r\nappeared to me to be about the size of the common red fox of the\r\nAtlantic states, or reather smaller than the large fox common to this\r\ncountry; convinced I am that it is a distinct species. The appearance\r\nof coal continues but in small quantities, but little appearance of\r\nbirnt hills or pumice stones the mineral salts have in some measure\r\nabated and no quarts. we saw a great number of the Bighorn some mule\r\ndeer and a few buffaloe and Elk, no antelopes or common deer. Drewyer\r\nwho was with me and myself killed two bighorned anamals; the sides of\r\nthe Clifts where these anamals resort much to lodg, have the peculiar\r\nsmell of the sheepfolds. the party killed in addition to our hunt 2\r\nbuffaloe and an Elk. the river today has been from 150 to 250 yds. wide\r\nbut little timber today on the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 31, 1805]\r\nMay 31st Friday 1805.\r\nA cloudy morning we dispatched all the Canoes to Collect the meat of 2\r\nBuffalow killed last night a head and a little off the river, and\r\nproceeded on with the perogues at an early hour. I attempted to walk on\r\nShore Soon found it verry laborious as the mud Stuck to my mockersons &\r\nwas verry Slippery. I return'd on board. it continued to rain\r\nmoderately untill about 12 oClock when it ceased, & Continued Cloudy.\r\nthe Stone on the edge of the river continue to form verry Considerable\r\nrapids, which are troublesom & dificuelt to pass, our toe rope which we\r\nare obliged to make use of altogether broke & we were in Some danger of\r\nturning over in the perogue in which I was, we landed at 12 and\r\nrefreshed the men with a dram, our men are obliged to under go great\r\nlabour and fatigue in assending this part of the Missouri, as they are\r\ncompelled from the rapidity of the Current in many places to walk in\r\nthe water & on Slippery hill Sides or the Sides of rocks, on Gravel &\r\nthro a Stiff mud bear footed, as they Cannot keep on Mockersons from\r\nthe Stiffness of the mud & decline of the Slipy. hills Sides--the Hills\r\nand river Clifts of this day exhibit a most romantick appearance on\r\neach Side of the river is a white Soft Sand Stone bluff which rises to\r\nabout half the hight of the hills, on the top of this Clift is a black\r\nearth on points, in maney places this Sand Stone appears like antient\r\nruins some like elegant buildings at a distance, Some like Towers &c.\r\n&c. in maney places of this days march we observe on either Side of the\r\nriver extraodanary walls of a black Semented Stone which appear to be\r\nregularly placed one Stone on the other, Some of those walls run to the\r\nhite of 100 feet, they are from about 1 foot to 12 feet thick and are\r\nperpendicular, those walls Commence at the waters edge & in Some places\r\nmeet at right angles--those walls appear to Continue their Course into\r\nthe Sand Clifts, the Stones which form those walls are of different\r\nSizes all Squar edged, Great numbers has fallen off from the walls near\r\nthe river which cause the walls to be of uneaquil hite, in the evening\r\nthe Countrey becomes lower and the bottoms wider, no timber on the\r\nuplands, except a few Cedar & pine on the Clifts a few Scattering\r\nCotton trees on the points in the river bottoms, The apparance of Coal\r\nContinus Capt Lewis walked on Shore & observed a Species of Pine we had\r\nnever before Seen, with a Shorter leaf than Common & the bur different,\r\nhe also Collected Some of the Stone off one of the walls which appears\r\nto be a Sement of Isin glass black earth we Camped on the Stard Side in\r\na Small timbered bottom above the mouth of a Creek on the Stard Side\r\nour hunters killed, 2 animals with big horns, 2 Buffalow & an Elk, we\r\nSaw Great numbers of those big horned animals on the Clifts, but fiew\r\nBuffalow or Elk, no antelope, a fiew mule deer, Saw a fox to day.

Soon after we got under way it began\r\nto rain and Continued untill 12 oClock when it Seased but Still\r\nremained cloudy through the ballance of the day. the obstructions of\r\nrocky points and riffles Still continue as yesterday; at those places\r\nthe men are compelled to be in the water even to their armpits, and the\r\nwater is yet very cold, and So frequent are those points that they are\r\none fourth of their time in the water. added to this the bank and bluff\r\nalong which they are obliged to pass are So Slippery and the mud So\r\ntenatious that they are unable to bare their mockersons, and in that\r\nSituation dragging the heavy burthen of a Canoe and Walking\r\noccasionally for Several hundred yards over the Sharp fragments of\r\nrocks which tumble from the Clifts; and in Short their labour is\r\nincredibly painfull and great, yet those faithfull fellows bear it\r\nwithout a murmer.\r\n\r\nThe toe rope of the white perogue, the only one indeed of hemp, and\r\nthat on which we most depended, gave way to day at a bad point, the\r\nperogue Swong and but slightly touched a rock, yet was very near\r\noversetting; I fear her evil Ginnie will play So many pranks with her\r\nthat She will go to the bottom Some of those days.\r\n\r\nI attempted to walk on Shore this morning but found it so excessivily\r\nbad that I Soon returned on board. at 12 oClock we came too for\r\nrefreshment and gave the men a dram which they received with much\r\nChearfulness, and well deserved all wet and disagreeable. Capt. Lewis\r\nwalked on Shore, he informed one that he Saw \"the most butifull fox in\r\nthe world\" the Colour appeared to him to be of a fine Orrange yellow,\r\nwhite and black, he fired at this fox running and missed him, he\r\nappeared to be about the size of the common red fox of the united\r\nStates, or rather smaller.\r\n\r\nThe hills and river clifts which we pass to day exhibit a most romantic\r\nappearance. The Bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300\r\nfeet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed of\r\nremarkable white Sandstone which is Sufficiently Soft to give way\r\nreadily to the impression of water; two or three thin horizontal\r\nStratas of white free Stone, on which the rains or water make no\r\nimpression, lie imbeded in those clifts of Soft Stone near the upper\r\npart of them; the earth on the top of these clifts is a dark rich loam,\r\nwhich forming a gradual ascending plain extend back from 1/2 a mile to\r\na mile where the hills commence and rise abruptly to the hight of about\r\n300 feet more. The water in the Course of time acecending from those\r\nhills and plains on either Side of the river has trickled down the Soft\r\nSand Clifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures; which with\r\nthe help of a little imagination and an oblique view at a distance are\r\nmade to represent elegant ranges of lofty freestone buildings, haveing\r\ntheir parapets well Stocked with Statuary; Colloms of various\r\nSculptures both Grooved and plain, are also Seen Supporting long\r\ngalleries in part of those buildings; in other places on a much nearer\r\napproach and with the with the help of less immagination we See the\r\nremains of ruins of eligant buildings; Some Collumns Standing and\r\nalmost entire with their pedestals and Capitals, others retaining their\r\npedestals but deprived by time or accedint of their capitals, Some\r\nlying prostrate and broken, others in the form of vast Pyramids of\r\nconnic Structure bearing a Serious of other pyramids on their tops\r\nbecomeing less as they ascend and finally termonateing in a Sharp\r\npoint. nitches and alcoves of various forms and Sizes are Seen at\r\ndifferent hights as we pass. a number of the Small martin which build\r\ntheir nests with Clay of a globular form attached to the wall within\r\nthose nitches, and which were Seen hovering about the top of the\r\ncollumns did not the less remind us of Some of those large Stone\r\nbuildings in the United States. The thin Stratas of hard free Stone\r\nintermixed with the Soft Sand Stone Seems to have aided the water in\r\nforming this Curious Scenery.\r\n\r\nas we passed on it Seemed as if those Seens of Visionary enchantment\r\nwould never have an end; for here it is too that nature presents to the\r\nview of the traveler vast ranges of walls of tolerable workmanship, So\r\nperfect indeed are those walls that I Should have thought that nature\r\nhad attempted here to rival the human art of Masonry had I not\r\nrecollected that She had first began her work. These walls rise to the\r\nhight in many places of 100 feet, are perpindicular, with two regular\r\nfaces, and are from one to 12 feet thick, each wall retains the Same\r\nthickness to the top which it possesses at bottom. The Stone of which\r\nthese walls are formed is black, dense and dureable, and appears to be\r\nComposed of a large portion of earth intermixed or Cemented with a\r\nSmall quantity of Sand and a Considerable portion of quarts. these\r\nStones are almost invariably regular parallelepipeds, of unequal Sizes\r\nin the wall, but equal in their horizontal ranges, at least as to\r\ndebth. These are laid regularly in ranges on each other like bricks,\r\neach breaking or covering this interstice of the two on which it rests,\r\nthus the pirpendicular interstices are broken, and the horizontal ones\r\nextend entire throughout the whole extent of the walls. These Stones\r\nSeam to bear Some proportion to the thickness of the walls in which\r\nthey are employd, being larger in the thicker walls; the greatest\r\nlength of the parallelepiped appear to form the thickness of the thiner\r\nwalls, while two or more are employed to form that of the thicker\r\nwalls. Those walls pass the river in Several places rising from the\r\nwaters edge much above the Sand Stone Bluffs, which they Seam to\r\npenetrate; thence Continueing their course on a Streight line on either\r\nSide of the river thorough the gradually ascending plains over which\r\nthey tower to the hight of from ten to 90 feet untill they reach the\r\nhills which they finally enter and Conceal themselves. these walls\r\nSometimes run parallel to each other, with Several ranges near each\r\nother, and at other times intersecting each other at right angles,\r\nhaveing the appearance of the walls of ancient houses or gardins. both\r\nCapt Lewis and My self walked on Shore this evening and examined those\r\nwalls minutely and preserved a Specimine of the Stone.--I found many\r\nclifts of very excellent free Stone of a light yellowish brown Colour.\r\nCapt. Lewis observed a Species of pine which I had never Seen, it\r\ndiffers from the pitch pine in the particular of its leaf and Cone, the\r\nfirst being partly Shorter, and the latter considerably longer and more\r\npointed. The appearance of Coal Continues but in Smaller quantities,\r\nbut little appearance of burnt hills or pumicestone. the mineral Salt\r\nin Some measure have abated and no quarts. we Saw a great number of the\r\nBig Horn, Some mule deer, and a few Buffalow and Elk, no antelopes or\r\nCommon Deer-. Capt. Lewis killed a Big horn animal. the party killed 2\r\nBuffalow one Elk and a Big horn or Ibex to day-. The river has been\r\nfrom 150 to 250 yards wide but little timber on the river to day. river\r\nless muddy than it was below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 1, 1805]\r\nSaturday June 1st 1805\r\nThe moring was cloudy and a few drops of rain. Set out at an early hour\r\nand proceeded as usual by the help of our chords. the river Clifts and\r\nbluffs not so high as yesterday and the country becomes more level. a\r\nmountain or a part of the N. Mountain appears to approach the river\r\nwithin 8 or 10 ms. bearing N. from our encampment of the last evening.\r\nCapt C. who walked on shore today informed me that the river hills were\r\nmuch lower than usual and that from the tops of those hills he had a\r\ndelightfull view of rich level and extensive plains on both sides of\r\nthe river; in those plains, which in many places reach the river\r\nclifts, he observed large banks of pure sand which appeared to have\r\nbeen driven by the S W. winds from the river bluffs and there\r\ndeposited. the plains are more fertile at some distance from the river\r\nthan near the bluffs where the surface of the earth is very generally\r\ncovered with small smothe pebbles which have the appearance of having\r\nbeen woarn by the agitation of the waters in which they were no doubt\r\nonce immerced. A range of high Mountains appear to the S. W. at a\r\nconsiderable distance covered with snow, they appear to run Westerly.\r\nno timber appears on the highlands; but much more than yesterday on the\r\nriver and Islands. rockey points and shoals less freequent than\r\nyesterday but some of them quite as bad when they did occur. the river\r\nfrom 2 to 400 yards wide, courant more gentle and still becoming\r\nclearer. game is by no means as abundant as below; we killed one male\r\nbighorn and a mule deer today; saw buffalow at a distance in the plains\r\nparticularly near a small Lake on Lard. side about 8 ms. distant. some\r\nfew drops of rain again fell this evening. we passed six Islands and\r\nencamped on the 7th; they are all small but contain some timber. the\r\nwind has been against us all day.--I saw the choke cherry the yellow\r\nand red courant bushes; the wild rose appears now to be in full bloom\r\nas are also the prickley pear which are numerous in these plains.--We\r\nalso saw some Indian Lodges of sticks today which did not appear to\r\nhave been long evacuated.--some coal appear in the bluffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 1, 1805]\r\nJune 1st Satterday 1805\r\na Cloudy morning we Set out at an early hour and proseeded on as usial\r\nwith the toe rope The Countrey appears to be lower and the Clifts not\r\nSo high or Common, a mountain or a part of the north Mountain about 8\r\nor 10 miles N. of this place, I walked on Shore to day found the Plains\r\nmuch lower than we have Seen them and on the top we behold an extencive\r\nplain on both Sides, in this plain I observed maney noles of fine Sand\r\nwhich appeared to have blown from the river bluffs and collected at\r\nthese points Those plains are fertile near the river a great no. of\r\nSmall Stone, I observed at Some distance to the S.

The river bluffs still continue to get lower and the\r\nplains leveler and more extensive; the timber on the river increases in\r\nquantity; the country in all other rispects much as discribed\r\nyesterday. I think we are now completely above the black hills we had a\r\nsmall shower of rain today but it lasted only a few minutes and was\r\nvery moderate. Game becomeing more abundant this morning and I thought\r\nit best now to loose no time or suffer an opportunity to escape in\r\nproviding the necessary quantity of Elk's skins to cover my leather\r\nboat which I now expect I shall be obliged to use shortly. Accordingly\r\nI walked on shore most of the day with some of the hunters for that\r\npurpose and killed 6 Elk 2 buffale 2 Mule deer and a bear. these\r\nanamals were all in good order we therefore took as much of the meat as\r\nour canoes and perogues could conveniently carry. the bear was very\r\nnear catching Drewyer; it also pursued Charbono who fired his gun in\r\nthe air as he ran but fortunately eluded the vigilence of the bear by\r\nsecreting himself very securely in the bushes untill Drewyer finally\r\nkilled it by a shot in the head; the shot indeed that will conquer the\r\nfarocity of those tremendious anamals.--in the course of the day we\r\npassed 9 Islands all of them small and most of them containing some\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nwe came too on the Lard. side in a handsome bottom of small cottonwood\r\ntimber opposite to the entrance of a very considerable river; but it\r\nbeing too late to examine these rivers minutely to night we determined\r\nto remain here untill the morning, and as the evening was favourable to\r\nmake some obsevations.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 2, 1805]\r\nJune 2nd Sunday 1805\r\nwe had a hard wind and a little rain last night, this morning fair we\r\nSet out at an early hour, wind from the S W.

An interesting\r\nquestion was now to be determined; which of these rivers was the\r\nMissouri, or that river which the Minnetares call Amahte Arz zha or\r\nMissouri, and which they had discribed to us as approaching very near\r\nto the Columbia river. to mistake the stream at this period of the\r\nseason, two months of the traveling season having now elapsed, and to\r\nascend such stream to the rocky Mountain or perhaps much further before\r\nwe could inform ourselves whether it did approach the Columbia or not,\r\nand then be obliged to return and take the other stream would not only\r\nloose us the whole of this season but would probably so dishearten the\r\nparty that it might defeat the expedition altogether. convinced we were\r\nthat the utmost circumspection and caution was necessary in deciding on\r\nthe stream to be taken. to this end an investigation of both streams\r\nwas the first thing to be done; to learn their widths, debths,\r\ncomparitive rappidity of their courants and thence the comparitive\r\nbodies of water furnished by each; accordingly we dispatched two light\r\ncanoes with three men in each up those streams; we also sent out\r\nseveral small parties by land with instructions to penetrate the\r\ncountry as far as they conveniently can permiting themselves time to\r\nreturn this evening and indeavour if possible to discover the distant\r\nbearing of those rivers by ascending the rising grounds. between the\r\ntime of my A.M. and meridian Capt. C & myself stroled out to the top of\r\nthe hights in the fork of these rivers from whence we had an extensive\r\nand most inchanting view; the country in every derection around us was\r\none vast plain in which innumerable herds of Buffalow were seen\r\nattended by their shepperds the wolves; the solatary antelope which now\r\nhad their young were distributed over it's face; some herds of Elk were\r\nalso seen; the verdure perfectly cloathed the ground, the weather was\r\npleasent and fair; to the South we saw a range of lofty mountains which\r\nwe supposed to be a continuation of the S. Mountains, streching\r\nthemselves from S. E. to N. W. terminating abbrubtly about S. West from\r\nus; these were partially covered with snow; behind these Mountains and\r\nat a great distance, a second and more lofty range of mountains\r\nappeared to strech across the country in the same direction with the\r\nothers, reaching from West, to the N of N. W., where their snowey tops\r\nlost themselves beneath the horizon. this last range was perfectly\r\ncovered with snow. the direction of the rivers could be seen but little\r\nway, soon loosing the break of their channels, to our view, in the\r\ncommon plain. on our return to camp we boar a little to the left and\r\ndiscovered a handsome little river falling into the N. fork on Lard.\r\nside about 11/2 ms. above our camp. this little river has as much\r\ntimber in it's bottoms as either of the larger streams. there are a\r\ngreat number of prickley pears in these plains; the Choke cherry grows\r\nhere in abundance both in the river bottoms and in the steep ravenes\r\nalong the river bluffs. saw the yellow and red courants, not yet ripe;\r\nalso the goosberry which begins to ripen; the wild rose which grows\r\nhere in great abundance in the bottoms of all these rivers is now in\r\nfull bloom, and adds not a little to the beaty of the cenery. we took\r\nthe width of the two rivers, found the left hand or S. fork 372 yards\r\nand the N. fork 200. The noth fork is deeper than the other but it's\r\ncourant not so swift; it's waters run in the same boiling and roling\r\nmanner which has uniformly characterized the Missouri throughout it's\r\nwhole course so far; it's waters are of a whitish brown colour very\r\nthick and terbid, also characteristic of the Missouri; while the South\r\nfork is perfectly transparent runds very rappid but with a smoth\r\nunruffled surface it's bottom composed of round and flat smooth stones\r\nlike most rivers issuing from a mountainous country. the bed of the N.\r\nfork composed of some gravel but principally mud; in short the air &\r\ncharacter of this river is so precisely that of the missouri below that\r\nthe party with very few exceptions have already pronounced the N. fork\r\nto be the Missouri; myself and Capt. C. not quite so precipitate have\r\nnot yet decided but if we were to give our opinions I believe we should\r\nbe in the minority, certain it is that the North fork gives the\r\ncolouring matter and character which is retained from hence to the\r\ngulph of Mexico. I am confident that this river rises in and passes a\r\ngreat distance through an open plain country I expect that it has some\r\nof it's souces on the Eastern side of the rocky mountain South of the\r\nSaskashawan, but that it dose not penetrate the first range of these\r\nMountains and that much the greater part of it's sources are in a\r\nnorthwardly direction towards the lower and middle parts of the\r\nSaskashawan in the open plains. convinced I am that if it penetrated\r\nthe Rocky Mountains to any great distance it's waters would be clearer\r\nunless it should run an immence distance indeed after leaving those\r\nmountains through these level plains in order to acquire it's turbid\r\nhue. what astonishes us a little is that the Indians who appeared to be\r\nso well acquainted with the geography of this country should not have\r\nmentioned this river on wright hand if it be not the Missouri; the\r\nriver that scolds at all others, as they call it if there is in\r\nreallity such an one, ought agreeably to their account, to have fallen\r\nin a considerable distance below, and on the other hand if this\r\nrighthand or N. fork be the Missouri I am equally astonished at their\r\nnot mentioning the S. fork which they must have passed in order to get\r\nto those large falls which they mention on the Missouri. thus have our\r\ncogitating faculties been busily employed all day.\r\n\r\nThose who have remained at camp today have been busily engaged in\r\ndressing skins for cloathing, notwithstanding that many of them have\r\ntheir feet so mangled and bruised with the stones and rough ground over\r\nwhich they passed barefoot, that they can scarcely walk or stand; at\r\nleast it is with great pain they do either. for some days past they\r\nwere unable to wear their mockersons; they have fallen off\r\nconsiderably, but notwithstanding the difficulties past, or those which\r\nseem now to mennace us, they still remain perfectly cheerfull. In the\r\nevening the parties whom we had sent out returned agreeably to\r\ninstructions. The parties who had been sent up the rivers in canoes\r\ninformed that they ascended some distance and had then left their\r\ncanoes and walked up the rivers a considerable distance further barely\r\nleaving themselves time to return; the North fork was not so rappid as\r\nthe other and afforded the easiest navigation of course; Six feet\r\nappeared to be the shallowest water of the S. Branch and 5 feet that of\r\nthe N. Their accounts were by no means satisfactory nor did the\r\ninformation we acquired bring us nigher to the decision of our question\r\nor determine us which stream to take. Sergt. Pryor had ascended the N.\r\nfork and had taken the following courses and distances-viz-\r\n\r\nJoseph and Reubin Fields reported that they had been up the South fork\r\nabout 7 mes. on a streight course somewhat N of W. and that there the\r\nlittle river which discharges itself into the North fork just above us,\r\nwas within 100 yards of the S. fork; that they came down this little\r\nriver and found it a boald runing stream of about 40 yds. wide containg\r\nmuch timber in it's bottom, consisting of the narrow and wide leafed\r\ncottonwood with some birch and box alder undrgrowth willows rosebushes\r\ncurrents &c. they saw a great number of Elk on this river and some\r\nbeaver. Those accounts being by no means satisfactory as to the\r\nfundamental point; Capt. C. and myself concluded to set out early the\r\nnext morning with a small party each, and ascend these rivers untill we\r\ncould perfectly satisfy ourselves of the one, which it would be most\r\nexpedient for us to take on our main journey to the Pacific.\r\naccordingly it was agreed that I should ascend the right hand fork and\r\nhe the left. I gave orders to Sergt. Pryor Drewyer, Shields, Windsor,\r\nCruzatte and La Page to hold themselves in readiness to accompany me in\r\nthe morning. Capt. Clark also selected Reubin &Joseph Fields, Sergt.\r\nGass, Shannon and his black man York, to accompany him. we agreed to go\r\nup those rivers one day and a halfs march or further if it should\r\nappear necessary to satisfy us more fully of the point in question. the\r\nhunters killed 2 Buffaloe, 6 Elk and 4 deer today. the evening proved\r\ncloudy. we took a drink of grog this evening and gave the men a dram,\r\nand made all matters ready for an early departure in the morning. I had\r\nnow my sack and blanket happerst in readiness to swing on my back,\r\nwhich is the first time in my life that I had ever prepared a burthen\r\nof this kind, and I am fully convinced that it will not be the last. I\r\ntake my Octant with me also, this I confide La Page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 3, 1805]\r\nJune 3rd Monday 1805\r\nwe formed a Camp on the point in the junction of the two rivers, and\r\ndispatched a Canoe & three men up each river to examine and find if\r\npossible which is the most probable branch, the left fork which is the\r\nlargest we are doubtfull of, the Indians do not mention any river\r\nfalling in on the right in this part of the Missouri, The Scolding\r\nriver, if there is Such a one Should have fallen in below agreeable to\r\ntheir accts. we also dispatched men in different dircts. by land, to a\r\nmountain Covered with Snow to the South & other up each river--Capt\r\nLewis and my Self walked out & assended the hill in the point observed\r\na leavel open Countrey to the foot of the mountains which lye South of\r\nthis, also a River which falls into the Right hand fork about 11/2\r\nmiles above its mouth on the Lard.

C. departed, and at the same time I passed the\r\nwright hand fork opposite to our camp below a small Island; from hence\r\nI steered N. 30 W. 41/2 to a commanding eminence; here I took the\r\nfollowing bearings of the mountains which were in view. The North\r\nMountains appear to change their direction from that of being parallel\r\nwith the Missouri turning to the North and terminating abruptly; their\r\ntermineation bearing N. 48° E distant by estimate 30 mes. The South\r\nMountains appear to turn to the S. also terminating abrubtly, their\r\nextremity bearing S. 8 W. distant 25 mes. The Barn Mountain, a lofty\r\nmountain so called from it's resemblance to the roof of a large Barn,\r\nis a seperate Mountain and appears reather to the wright of and\r\nretreating from the extremity of the S. mts.; this boar S. 38 W.\r\ndistant 35 ms. The North fork which I am now ascending lies to my left\r\nand appears to make a considerable bend to the N. W. on it's Western\r\nborder a range of hills about 10 mes. long appear to lye parallel with\r\nthe river and from hence bear N. 60° W. to the N. of this range of hills\r\nan Elivated point of the river bluff on it's Lard. side boar N. 72° W.\r\ndistant 12 mes. to this last object I now directed my course through a\r\nhigh level dry open plain. the whole country in fact appears to be one\r\ncontinued plain to the foot of the mountains or as far as the eye can\r\nreach; the soil appears dark rich and fertile yet the grass is by no\r\nmeans as high nor dose it look so luxurient as I should have expected,\r\nit is short just sufficient to conceal the ground. great abundance of\r\nprickly pears which are extreemly troublesome; as the thorns very\r\nreadily perce the foot through the Mockerson; they are so numerous that\r\nit requires one half of the traveler's attention to avoid them In these\r\nplains I observed great numbers of the brown Curloos, a small species\r\nof curloo or plover of a brown colour about the size of the common\r\nsnipe and not unlike it in form with a long celindric curved and\r\npointed beak; it's wings are proportionately long and the tail short;\r\nin the act of liteing this bird lets itself down by an extention of\r\nit's wings without motion holding their points very much together above\r\nit's back, in this rispect differing ascentially from any bird I ever\r\nobserved. a number of sparrows also of three distinct species I\r\nobserved. also a small bird which in action resembles the lark, it is\r\nabout the size of a large sparrow of a dark brown colour with some\r\nwhite fathers in the tail; this bird or that which I take to be the\r\nmale rises into the air about 60 feet and supporting itself in the air\r\nwith a brisk motion of the wings sings very sweetly, has several shrill\r\nsoft notes reather of the plaintive order which it frequently repeats\r\nand varies, after remaining stationary about a minute in his aireal\r\nstation he descends obliquely occasionly pausing and accomnying his\r\ndecension with a note something like twit twit twit; on the ground he\r\nis silent. thirty or forty of these birds will be stationed in the air\r\nat a time in view, these larks as I shall call them add much to the\r\ngayety and cheerfullness of the scene. All those birds are now seting\r\nand laying their eggs in the plains; their little nests are to be seen\r\nin great abundance as we pass. there are meriads of small grasshoppers\r\nin these plains which no doubt furnish the principal aliment of this\r\nnumerous progeny of the feathered creation. after walking about eight\r\nmiles I grew thisty and there being no water in the plains I changed my\r\ndirection and boar obliquely in towards the river, on my arrival at\r\nwhich about 3 mes. below the point of observation, we discovered two\r\ndeer at feed at some distance near the river; I here halted the party\r\nand sent Drewyer to kill one of them for breakfast; this excellent\r\nhunter soon exceded his orders by killing of them both; they proved to\r\nbe two Mule Bucks in fine order; we soon kindled a fire cooked and made\r\na hearty meal. it was not yet twelve when we arrived at the river and I\r\nwas anxious to take the Meridian Altd. of the sun but the clouds prevent\r\ned my obtaining the observation. after refreshing ourselves we proceded\r\nup the river to the extremity of the first course, from whence the\r\nriver boar on it's general course N. 15° W. 2 M. to a bluff point on\r\nStard. here Drewyer killed four other deer of the common kind; we\r\nskined them and hung up a part of the meat and the skins as we did also\r\nof the first, and took as much of the meat as we thought would answer\r\nfor our suppers and proceeded N. 30 W. 2 m. to the entrance of a large\r\ncreek on Lard. side the part of the river we have passed is from 40 to\r\n60 yds. wide, is deep, has falling banks, the courant strong, the water\r\nterbid and in short has every appearance of the missouri below except\r\nas to size. it's bottoms narrow but well timbered. Salts coal and other\r\nmineral appearances as usual; the bluffs principally of dark brown,\r\nyellow and some white clay; some freestone also appears in places. The\r\nriver now boar N. 20° E. 12 mes. to a bluff on Lard. At the commencement\r\nof this course we ascended the hills which are about 200 feet high, and\r\npassed through the plains about 3 m. but finding the dry ravines so\r\nsteep and numerous we determined to return to the river and travel\r\nthrough it's bottoms and along the foot and sides of the bluffs,\r\naccordingly we again reached the river about 4 miles from the\r\ncommencement of the last course and encamped a small distant above on\r\nthe Stard. side in a bend among the willow bushes which defended us\r\nfrom the wind which blew hard from the N. W. it rained this evening and\r\nwet us to the skin; the air was extremely could. just before we\r\nencamped Drewyer fired at a large brown bar across the river and\r\nwounded him badly but it was too late to pursue him. killed a braro and\r\na beaver, also at the place of our encampment, a very fine Mule deer.\r\nwe saw a great number of Buffaloe, Elk, wolves and foxes today. the\r\nriver bottoms form one emence garden of roses, now in full bloe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 4, 1805]\r\nJune 4th Tuesday 1805\r\nCapt.

W. 4 m. at the entrance of this creek the bluffs were\r\nvery steep and approached the river so near on the Stard. side that we\r\nascended the hills and passed through the plains; at the extremity of\r\nthis course we returned to the river which then boar North 2 rues. from\r\nthe same point, I discovered a lofty single mountain which appeard to\r\nbe at a great distance, perhaps 80 or more miles it boar N. 52 W. from\r\nit's conic figure I called it tower Mountain. we now passed through the\r\nriver bottoms to the extremity of the last course thence with the river\r\nS 60° W 11/2 m.

I saw a flock of the mountain cock, or a large species of heath\r\nhen with a long pointed tail which the Indians informed us were common\r\nto the Rockey Mountains, I sent Shields to kill one of them but he was\r\nobliged to fire a long distance at them and missed his aim. as we had\r\nnot killed or eat anything today we each killed a burrowing squrrel as\r\nwe passed them in order to make shure of our suppers. we again\r\nintersepted the river at the expiration of the last course or the lard.\r\nbluffs, from whence it now boar N 80° W. 2 mes. from this point saw some\r\nother lofty mountains to the N.

The forepart of the last evening was fair but in the latter part\r\nof the night clouded up and contnued so with short intervals of\r\nsunshine untill a little before noon when the whole horizon was\r\novercast, and I of course disappointed in making the observation which\r\nI much wished. I had sent Sergt. Pryor and Windsor early this morning\r\nwith orders to procede up the river to some commanding eminence and\r\ntake it's bearing as far as possible. in the mean time the four others\r\nand myself were busily engaged in making two rafts on which we purposed\r\ndescending the river; we had just completed this work when Sergt. Pryor\r\nand Windsor returned, it being about noon; they reported that they had\r\nproceded from hence S 70 W. 6 m. to the summit of a commanding eminence\r\nfrom whence the river on their left was about 21/2 miles distant; that\r\na point of it's Lard. bluff, which was visible boar S 80 W. distant\r\nabout 15 ms.; that the river on their left bent gradually arround to\r\nthis point, and from thence seemed to run Northwardly. we now took\r\ndinner and embarcked with our plunder and five Elk's skins on the rafts\r\nbut were soon convinced that this mode of navigation was hazerdous\r\nparticularly with those rafts they being too small and slender. we wet\r\na part of our baggage and were near loosing one of our guns; I\r\ntherefore determined to abandon the rafts and return as we had come, by\r\nland. I regreted much being obliged to leave my Elk's skins, which I\r\nwanted to assist in forming my leather boat; those we had prepared at\r\nFort Mandan being injured in such manner that they would not answer. we\r\nagain swung our packs and took our way through the open plains for\r\nabout 12 mes. when we struck the river; the wind blew a storm from N.\r\nE. accompanyed by frequent showers of rain; we were wet and very could.\r\ncontinued our rout down the river only a few miles before the\r\nAbruptness of the clifts and their near approach to the river compelled\r\nus take the plains and once more face the storm; here we boar reather\r\ntoo much to the North and it was late in the evening before we reached\r\nthe river, in our way we killed two buffaloe and took with us as much\r\nof the flesh as served us that night, and a part of the next day. we\r\nencamped a little below the entrance of the large dry Creek called Lark\r\nC. having traveled abut 25 mes. since noon. it continues to rain and we\r\nhave no shelter, an uncomfortable nights rest is the natural\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 6, 1805]\r\nJune 6th Thursday 1805\r\na Cloudy Cold raw day wind hard from the N.

E. and could. the grownd remarkably slipry, insomuch\r\nthat we were unable to walk on the sides of the bluffs where we had\r\npassed as we ascended the river. notwithstanding the rain that has now\r\nfallen the earth of these bluffs is not wet to a greater debth than 2\r\ninches; in it's present state it is precisely like walking over frozan\r\ngrownd which is thawed to small debth and slips equally as bad. this\r\nclay not only appears to require more water to saturate it as I before\r\nobserved than any earth I ever observed but when saturated it appears\r\non the other hand to yeald it's moisture with equal difficulty. In\r\npassing along the face of one of these bluffs today I sliped at a\r\nnarrow pass of about 30 yards in length and but for a quick and\r\nfortunate recovery by means of my espontoon I should been precipitated\r\ninto the river down a craggy pricipice of about ninety feet. I had\r\nscarcely reached a place on which I could stand with tolerable safety\r\neven with the assistance of my espontoon before I heard a voice behind\r\nme cry out god god Capt. what shall I do on turning about I found it\r\nwas Windsor who had sliped and fallen abut the center of this narrow\r\npass and was lying prostrate on his belley, with his wright hand arm\r\nand leg over the precipice while he was holding on with the left arm\r\nand foot as well as he could which appeared to be with much difficulty.\r\nI discovered his danger and the trepedation which he was in gave me\r\nstill further concern for I expected every instant to see him loose his\r\nstrength and slip off; altho much allarmed at his situation I disguised\r\nmy feelings and spoke very calmly to him and assured him that he was in\r\nno kind of danger, to take the knife out of his belt behind him with\r\nhis wright hand and dig a hole with it in the face of the bank to\r\nreceive his wright foot which he did and then raised himself to his\r\nknees; I then directed him to take off his mockersons and to come\r\nforward on his hands and knees holding the knife in one hand and the\r\ngun in the other this he happily effected and escaped. those who were\r\nsome little distance bhind returned by my orders and waded the river at\r\nthe foot of the bluff where the water was breast deep. it was useless\r\nwe knew to attempt the plains on this part of the river in consequence\r\nof the numerous steep ravines which intersected and which were quite as\r\nhad as the river bluffs. we therefore continued our rout down the river\r\nsometimes in the mud and water of the bottom lands, at others in the\r\nriver to our breasts and when the water became so deep that we could\r\nnot wade we cut footsteps in the face of the steep bluffs with our\r\nknives and proceded. we continued our disagreeable march through the\r\nrain mud and water untill late in the evening having traveled only\r\nabout 18 miles, and encamped in an old Indian stick lodge which\r\nafforded us a dry and comfortable shelter. during the day we had killed\r\nsix deer some of them in very good order altho none of them had yet\r\nentirely discarded their winter coats. we had reserved and brought with\r\nus a good supply of the best peices; we roasted and eat a hearty supper\r\nof our venison not having taisted a mosel before during the day; I now\r\nlaid myself down on some willow boughs to a comfortable nights rest,\r\nand felt indeed as if I was fully repaid for the toil and pain of the\r\nday, so much will a good shelter, a dry bed, and comfortable supper\r\nrevive the sperits of the waryed, wet and hungry traveler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 7, 1805]\r\nJune 7th Friday 1805\r\nrained moderately all the last night and Continus this morning, the\r\nwind from the S.

The\r\nriver bottoms affording all the timber which is to be seen in the\r\ncountry they are filled with innumerable litle birds that resort\r\nthither either for shelter or to build their nests. when sun began to\r\nshine today these birds appeared to be very gay and sung most\r\ninchantingly; I observed among them the brown thrush, Robbin, turtle\r\ndove, linnit goaldfinch, the large and small blackbird, wren and\r\nseveral other birds of less note. some of the inhabitants of the\r\npraries also take reffuge in these woods at night or from a storm. The\r\nwhole of my party to a man except myself were fully peswaided that this\r\nriver was the Missouri, but being fully of opinion that it was neither\r\nthe main stream or that which it would be advisable for us to take, I\r\ndetermined to give it a name and in honour of Miss Maria W-d. called it\r\nMaria's River. it is true that the hue of the waters of this turbulent\r\nand troubled stream but illy comport with the pure celestial virtues\r\nand amiable qualifications of that lovely fair one; but on the other\r\nhand it is a noble river; one destined to become in my opinion an\r\nobject of contention between the two great powers of America and Great\r\nBritin with rispect to the adjustment of the North westwardly boundary\r\nof the former; and that it will become one of the most interesting\r\nbrances of the Missouri in a commercial point of view, I have but\r\nlittle doubt, as it abounds with anamals of the fur kind, and most\r\nprobably furnishes a safe and direct communication to that productive\r\ncountry of valuable furs exclusively enjoyed at present by the subjects\r\nof his Britanic Majesty; in adition to which it passes through a rich\r\nfertile and one of the most beatifully picteresque countries that I\r\never beheld, through the wide expance of which, innumerable herds of\r\nliving anamals are seen, it's borders garnished with one continued\r\ngarden of roses, while it's lofty and open forrests, are the habitation\r\nof miriads of the feathered tribes who salute the ear of the passing\r\ntraveler with their wild and simple, yet sweet and cheerfull melody.--I\r\narrived at camp about 5 OClock in the evening much fatiegued, where I\r\nfound Capt. Clark and the ballance of the party waiting our return with\r\nsome anxiety for our safety having been absent near two days longer\r\nthan we had engaged to return. on our way to camp we had killed 4 deer\r\nand two Antelopes; the skins of which as well as those we killed while\r\non the rout we brought with us. Maria's river may be stated generally\r\nfrom sixty to a hundred yards wide, with a strong and steady current\r\nand possessing 5 feet water in the most sholly parts.\r\n\r\nAs the incidents which occurred Capt. C. during his rout will be more\r\nfully and satisfactoryley expressed by himself I here insert a copy of\r\nhis journal during the days we wer seperated.-\r\n\r\nI now gave myself this evening to rest from my labours, took a drink of\r\ngrog and gave the men who had accompanyed me each a dram. Capt. Clark\r\nploted the courses of the two rivers as far as we had ascended them. I\r\nnow began more than ever to suspect the varacity of Mr. Fidler or the\r\ncorrectness of his instruments. for I see that Arrasmith in his late\r\nmap of N. America has laid down a remarkable mountain in the chain of\r\nthe Rocky mountains called the tooth nearly as far South as Latitude 45°,\r\nand this is said to be from the discoveries of Mr. Fidler? we are now\r\nwithin a hundred miles of the Rocky Mountains, and I find from my\r\nobservation of the 3rd Inst that the latitude of this place is 47° 24'\r\n12.8\". the river must therefore turn much to the South, between this\r\nand the rocky Mountain to have permitted Mr. Fidler to have passed\r\nalong the Eastern border of these mountains as far S. as nearly 45°\r\nwithout even seeing it. but from hence as far as Capt. C. had ascended\r\nthe S. fork or Missouri being the distance of 55 miles it's course is\r\nS. 29°W. and it still appeared to bear considerably to the W. of South as\r\nfar as he could see it. I think therefore that we shall find that the\r\nMissouri enters the rocky mountains to the North of 45°--we did take the\r\nliberty of placing his discoveries or at least the Southern extremity\r\nof them about a degree further N. in the sketh which we sent on to the\r\ngovernment this spring mearly from the Indian information of the\r\nbearing from Fort Mandan of the entrance of the Missouri into the Rocky\r\nMountains, and I reather suspect that actual observation will take him\r\nat least one other degree further North. The general Course of Maria's\r\nriver from hence to the extremity of the last course taken by Sergt.\r\npryor is N 69° W. 59 mes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 8, 1805]\r\nJune 8th Saturday 1805\r\nrained moderately all the last night & Some this morning untill 10\r\noClock, I am Some what uneasy for Capt. Lewis & party as days has now\r\npassed the time he was to have returned, I had all the arms put in\r\norder and permited Severall men to hunt, aired and dried our Stores &c.\r\nThe rivers at this point has fallen 6 Inches Sinc our arrival, at 10\r\noClock cleared away and became fair--the wind all the morning from the\r\nS. W. & hard--The water of the South fork is of a redish brown colour\r\nthis morning the other river of a whitish colour as usual-The mountains\r\nto the South Covered with Snow. Wind Shifted to the N E in the evening,\r\nabout 5 oClock Capt. Lewis arrived with the party much fatigued, and\r\ninform'd me that he had assended the river about 60 miles by Land and\r\nthat the river had a bold current of about 80 or 100 yards wide the\r\nbottoms of Gravel & mud, and may be estimated at 5 feet water in\r\nSholest parts\r\n\r\nSome rain in the evening. the left hand fork rose a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 9, 1805]\r\nSunday June 9th 1805.\r\nWe determined to deposite at this place the large red perogue all the\r\nheavy baggage which we could possibly do without and some provision,\r\nsalt, tools powder and Lead &c with a view to lighten our vessels and\r\nat the same time to strengthen their crews by means of the seven hands\r\nwho have been heretofore employd. in navigating the red perogue;\r\naccordingly we set some hands to diging a hole or cellar for the\r\nreception of our stores. these holes in the ground or deposits are\r\ncalled by the engages cashes; on enquiry I found that Cruzatte was well\r\nacquainted this business and therefore left the management of it\r\nintirely to him. today we examined our maps, and compared the\r\ninformation derived as well from them as from the Indians and fully\r\nsettled in our minds the propryety of addopting the South fork for the\r\nMissouri, as that which it would be most expedient for us to take. The\r\ninformation of Mr. Fidler incorrect as it is strongly argued the\r\nnecessity of taking the South fork, for if he has been along the\r\nEastern side of the rocky mountains as far as even Latd. 47°, which I\r\nthink fully as far south as he ever was in that direction, and saw only\r\nsmall rivulets making down from those mountains the presumption is very\r\nstrong that those little streams do not penetrate the rocky Mountains\r\nto such distance as would afford rational grownds for a conjecture that\r\nthey had their sources near any navigable branch of the Columbia, and\r\nif he has seen those rivulets as far south as 47° they are most probably\r\nthe waters of some Nothern branch of the Missouri or South fork\r\nprobably the river called by the Indians Medicine River; we therefore\r\ncannot hope by going Northwardly of this place being already in\r\nLatititude 47° 24\" to find a stream between this place and the\r\nSaskashawan which dose penetrate the Rocky mountains, and which\r\nagreeably to the information of the Indians with rispect to the\r\nMissouri, dose possess a navigable curent some distance in those\r\nmountains. The Indian information also argued strongly in favour of the\r\nSouth fork. they informed us that the water of the Missouri was nearly\r\ntransparent at the great falls, this is the case with the water of the\r\nSouth fork; that the falls lay a little to the South of sunset from\r\nthem; this is also brobable as we are only a few minutes North of Fort\r\nMandan and the South fork bears considerably South from hence to the\r\nMountains; that the falls are below the rocky mountains and near the\r\nNothern termineation of one range of those mountains. a range of\r\nmountains which apear behind the S. Mountains and which appear to\r\nterminate S. W. from this place and on this side of the unbroken chain\r\nof the Rocky Mountains gives us hope that this part of their\r\ninformation is also correct, and there is sufficient distance between\r\nthis and the mountains for many and I fear for us much too many falls.\r\nanother impression on my mind is that if the Indians had passed any\r\nstream as large as the South fork on their way to the Missouri that\r\nthey would not have omitted mentioning it; and the South fork from it's\r\nsize and complexion of it's waters must enter the Ry. Mountains and in\r\nmy opinion penetrates them to a great distance, or els whence such an\r\nimmence body of water as it discharges; it cannot procede from the dry\r\nplains to the N. W. of the Yellow Stone river on the East side of the\r\nRocky Mountains for those numerous large dry channels which we\r\nwitnessed on that side as we ascended the Missouri forbid such a\r\nconjecture; and that it should take it's sourses to the N. W. under\r\nthose mountains the travels of Mr. Fidler fobid us to beleive. Those\r\nideas as they occurred to me I indevoured to impress on the minds of\r\nthe party all of whom except Capt. C. being still firm in the beleif\r\nthat the N. Fork was the Missouri and that which we ought to take; they\r\nsaid very cheerfully that they were ready to follow us any wher we\r\nthought proper to direct but that they still thought that the other was\r\nthe river and that they were affraid that the South fork would soon\r\ntermineate in the mountains and leave us at a great distance from the\r\nColumbia. Cruzatte who had been an old Missouri navigator and who from\r\nhis integrity knowledge and skill as a waterman had acquired the\r\nconfidence of every individual of the party declared it as his opinion\r\nthat the N. fork was the true genuine Missouri and could be no other.\r\nfinding them so determined in this beleif, and wishing that if we were\r\nin an error to be able to detect it and rectify it as soon as possible\r\nit was agreed between Capt. C. and myself that one of us should set out\r\nwith a small party by land up the South fork and continue our rout up\r\nit untill we found the falls or reached the snowy Mountains by which\r\nmeans we should be enabled to determine this question prety accurately.\r\nthis expedition I prefered undertaking as Capt. C best waterman &c. and\r\ndetermined to set out the day after tomorrow; I wished to make some\r\nfurther observations at this place, and as we had determined to leave\r\nour blacksmith's bellows and tools here it was necessary to repare some\r\nof our arms, and particularly my Airgun the main spring of which was\r\nbroken, before we left this place. these and some other preperations\r\nwill necessarily detain us two perhaps three days. I felt myself very\r\nunwell this morning and took a portion of salts from which I feel much\r\nreleif this evening. The cash being completed I walked to it and\r\nexamined it's construction. it is in a high plain about 40 yards\r\ndistant from a steep bluff of the South branch on it's nothern side;\r\nthe situation a dry one which is always necessary. a place being fixed\r\non for a cash, a circle abut 20 inches in diameter is first discribed,\r\nthe terf or sod of this circle is carefully removed, being taken out as\r\nentire as possible in order that it may be replaced in the same\r\nsituation when the chash is filled and secured. this circular hole is\r\nthen sunk perpendicularly to the debth of one foot, if the ground be\r\nnot firm somewhat deeper. they then begin to work it out wider as they\r\nproceed downwards untill they get it about six or seven feet deep\r\ngiving it nearly the shape of the kettle or lower part of a large\r\nstill. it's bottom is also somewhat sunk in the center. the dementions\r\nof the cash is in proportion to the quantity of articles intended to be\r\ndeposited. as the earth is dug it is handed up in a vessel and\r\ncarefully laid on a skin or cloth and then carryed to some place where\r\nit can be thrown in such manner as to conseal it usually into some\r\nruning stream wher it is washed away and leaves no traces which might\r\nlead to the discovery of the cash. before the goods are deposited they\r\nmust be well dryed; a parsel of small dry sticks are then collected and\r\nwith them a floor is maid of three or four inches thick which is then\r\ncovered with some dry hay or a raw hide well dryed; on this the\r\narticles are deposited, taking care to keep them from touching the\r\nwalls by putting other dry sticks between as you stoe away the\r\nmerchandize, when nearly full the goods are covered with a skin and\r\nearth thrown in and well ramed untill with the addition of the turf\r\nfurst removed the whole is on a level with the serface of the ground.\r\nin this manner dryed skins or merchandize will keep perfectly sound for\r\nseveral years. the traders of the Missouri, particularly those engaged\r\nin the trade with the Siouxs are obliged to have frequent recourse to\r\nthis method in order to avoyd being robed. most of the men are busily\r\nengaged dressing skins for cloathing. In the evening Cruzatte gave us\r\nsome music on the violin and the men passed the evening in dancing\r\nsinging &c and were extreemly cheerfull.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 9, 1805]\r\nJune 9th Sunday a fair morning the wind hard from the S.

Course of the South fork\r\nfor 35 miles is S. 29° W.--that of the N. fork is N. 69° W. for 59 miles,\r\nand as we are North of Fort mandan it is probable the most Southerley\r\nfork is the best for us.--Capt.

Fork three hundred yards distant from the point. we concluded that\r\nwe still could spare more amunition for this deposit Capt. Clark was\r\ntherefore to make a further deposit in the morning, in addition to one\r\nKeg of 20 lbs. and an adequate proportion of lead which had been laid\r\nby to be buryed in the large Cash. we now scelected the articles to be\r\ndeposited in this cash which consisted of 2 best falling axes, one\r\nauger, a set of plains, some files, blacksmiths bellowses and hammers\r\nStake tongs &c. 1 Keg of flour, 2 Kegs of parched meal, 2 Kegs of Pork,\r\n1 Keg of salt, some chissels, a cooper's Howel, some tin cups, 2\r\nMusquets, 3 brown bear skins, beaver skins, horns of the bighorned\r\nanamal, a part of the men's robes clothing and all their superfluous\r\nbaggage of every discription, and beaver traps.--we drew up the red\r\nperogue into the middle of a small Island at the entrance of Maria's\r\nriver, and secured and made her fast to the trees to prevent the high\r\nfloods from carrying her off put my brand on several trees standing\r\nnear her, and covered her with brush to shelter her from the effects of\r\nthe sun. At 3 P.M. we had a hard wind from the S. W. which continued\r\nabout an hour attended with thunder and rain. as soon as the shower had\r\npassed over we drew out our canoes, corked, repared and loaded them. I\r\nstill feel myself somewhat unwell with the disentary, but determined to\r\nset out in the morning up the South fork or Missouri leaving Capt.\r\nClark to compleat the deposit and follow me by water with the party;\r\naccordingly gave orders to Drewyer, Joseph Fields, Gibson and Goodrich\r\nto hold themselves in readiness to accompany me in the morning.\r\nSah-cah-gah, we a, our Indian woman is very sick this evening; Capt.

I swung my pack, and set forward with my little party.\r\nproceeded to the point where Rose River a branch Maria's River\r\napproaches the Missouri so nearly. from this hight we discovered a herd\r\nof Elk on the Missouri just above us to which we desended and soon\r\nkilled four of them. we butchered them and hung up the meat and skins\r\nin view of the river in order that the party might get them. I\r\ndetermined to take dinner here, but before the meal was prepared I was\r\ntaken with such violent pain in the intestens that I was unable to\r\npartake of the feast of marrowbones. my pain still increased and\r\ntowards evening was attended with a high fever; finding myself unable\r\nto march, I determined to prepare a camp of some willow boughs and\r\nremain all night. having brought no medecine with me I resolved to try\r\nan experiment with some simples; and the Choke cherry which grew\r\nabundanly in the bottom first struck my attention; I directed a parsel\r\nof the small twigs to be geathered striped of their leaves, cut into\r\npieces of about 2 Inches in length and boiled in water untill a strong\r\nblack decoction of an astringent bitter tact was produced; at sunset I\r\ntook a point of this decoction and abut an hour after repeated the dze\r\nby 10 in the evening I was entirely releived from pain and in fact\r\nevery symptom of the disorder forsook me; my fever abated, a gentle\r\nperspiration was produced and I had a comfortable and refreshing nights\r\nrest. Goodrich who is remarkably fond of fishing caught several douzen\r\nfish of two different species--one about 9 inches long of white colour\r\nround and in form and fins resembles the white chub common to the\r\nPotomac; this fish has a smaller head than the Chubb and the mouth is\r\nbeset both above and below with a rim of fine sharp teeth; the eye\r\nmoderately large, the puple dark and the iris which is narrow is of a\r\nyellowish brown colour, they bite at meat or grasshoppers. this is a\r\nsoft fish, not very good, tho the flesh is of a fine white colour. the\r\nother species is precisely the form and about the size of the well\r\nknown fish called the Hickory Shad or old wife, with the exception of\r\nthe teeth, a rim of which garnish the outer edge of both the upper and\r\nlower jaw; the tonge and pallet are also beset with long sharp teeth\r\nbending inwards, the eye of this fish is very large, and the iris of a\r\nsilvery colour and wide. of the 1st species we had caught some few\r\nbefore our arrival at the entrance of Maria's river, but of the last we\r\nhad seen none untill we reached that place and took them in Missouri\r\nabove it's junction with that river. the latter kind are much the best,\r\nand do not inhabit muddy water; the white cat continue as high as the\r\nentrance of Maria's R, but those we have caught above Mandans never\r\nexcede 6 lbs. I beleive that there are but few in this part of the\r\nMissouri. saw an abundance of game today even in our short march of 9\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 11, 1805]\r\nJune 11th Tuesday 1805\r\na fair morning wind from the S W. hard we burry 1 keg in the Cash & 2\r\nCanisters of Powder in 2 seperate places all with Lead; & in the Cash 2\r\naxes, auger, Plains, 1 Keg flour, 2 Kegs Pork, 2 Kegs Parchd meal 1 Keg\r\nsalt, files Chisel, 2 Musquits, Some tin cups, bowel, 3 bear Skins,\r\nBeaver Skins, Horns, & parts of the mens robes & clothes.--Beaver Traps\r\nand blacksmith's tools.

I now boar out from the river in\r\norder to avoid the steep ravines of the river which usually make out in\r\nthe plain to the distance of one or two miles; after gaining the leavel\r\nplain my couse was a litte to the West of S. W.--having traveled about\r\n12 miles by 9 in the morning, the sun became warm, and I boar a little\r\nto the south in order to gain the river as well to obtain water to\r\nallay my thirst as to kill something for breakfast; for the plain\r\nthrough which we had been passing possesses no water and is so level\r\nthat we cannot approach the buffaloe within shot before they discover\r\nus and take to flight. we arrived at the river about 10 A.M. having\r\ntraveled about 15 m. at this place there is a handsom open bottom with\r\nsome cottonwood timber, here we met with two large bear, and killed\r\nthem boath at the first fire, a circumstance which I beleive has never\r\nhappend with the party in killing the brown bear before. we dressed the\r\nbear, breakfasted on a part of one of them and hung the meat and skins\r\non the trees out of the reach of the wolves. I left a note on a stick\r\nnear the river for Capt. Clark, informing him of my progress &c.--after\r\nrefreshing ourselves abut 2 hours we again ascended the bluffs and\r\ngained the high plain; saw a great number of burrowing squirrels in the\r\nplains today. also wolves Antelopes mule deer and immence herds of\r\nbuffaloe. we passed a ridge of land considerably higher than the\r\nadjacent plain on either side, from this hight we had a most beatifull\r\nand picturesk view of the Rocky mountains which wer perfectly covered\r\nwith Snow and reaching from S. E. to the N. of N. W.--they appear to be\r\nformed of several ranges each succeeding range rising higher than the\r\npreceding one untill the most distant appear to loose their snowey tops\r\nin the clouds; this was an august spectacle and still rendered more\r\nformidable by the recollection that we had them to pass. we traveled\r\nabout twelve miles when we agin struck the Missoury at a handsome\r\nlittle bottom of Cottonwood timber and altho the sun had not yet set I\r\nfelt myself somewhat weary being weakened I presume by late disorder;\r\nand therfore determined to remain here during the ballance of the day\r\nand night, having marched about 27 miles today. on our way in the\r\nevening we had killed a buffaloe, an Antelope and three mule deer, and\r\ntaken a sufficient quantity of the best of the flesh of these anamals\r\nfor three meals, which we had brought with us. This evening I ate very\r\nheartily and after pening the transactions of the day amused myself\r\ncatching those white fish mentioned yesterday; they are here in great\r\nabundance I caught upwards of a douzen in a few minutes; they bit most\r\nfreely at the melt of a deer which goodrich had brought with him for\r\nthe purpose of fishing.\r\n\r\nThe narrow leafed cottonwood grows here in common with the other\r\nspecies of the same tree with a broad leaf or that which has\r\nconstituted the major part of the timber of the Missouri from it's\r\njunction with the Mississippi to this place. The narrow leafed\r\ncottonwood differs only from the other in the shape of it's leaf and\r\ngreater thickness of it's bark. the leaf is a long oval acutely\r\npointed, about 21/2 or 3 Inches long and from 3/4 to an inch in width;\r\nit is thick, sometimes slightly grooved or channeled; margin slightly\r\nserrate; the upper disk of a common green while the under disk is of a\r\nwhiteish green; the leaf is smoth. the beaver appear to be extremely\r\nfond of this tree and even seem to scelect it from among the other\r\nspecies of Cottonwood, probably from it's affording a deeper and softer\r\nbark than the other species.--saw some sign of the Otter as well as\r\nbeaver near our camp, also a great number of tracks of the brown bear;\r\nthese fellows leave a formidable impression in the mud or sand I\r\nmeasured one this evening which was eleven inches long exclusive of the\r\ntallons and seven and 1/4 in width.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 12, 1805]\r\nJune 12th 1805 Wednesday\r\nlast night was Clear and Cold, this morning fair we Set out at 8 oClock\r\n& proceeded on verry well wind from the S.

W. two curious mountains presented\r\nthemselves of square figures, the sides rising perpendicularly to the\r\nhight of 250 feet and appeared to be formed of yellow clay; their tops\r\nappeared to be level plains; these inaccessible hights appeared like\r\nthe ramparts of immence fortifications; I have no doubt but with very\r\nlittle assistance from art they might be rendered impregnable. fearing\r\nthat the river boar to the South and that I might pass the falls if\r\nthey existed between this an the snowey mountains I altered my course\r\nnealy to the South leaving those insulated hills to my wright and\r\nproceeded through the plain; I sent Feels on my right and Drewyer and\r\nGibson on my left with orders to kill some meat and join me at the\r\nriver where I should halt for dinner. I had proceded on this course\r\nabout two miles with Goodrich at some distance behind me whin my ears\r\nwere saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing\r\na little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn\r\nof smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I\r\npresume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not\r\nhowever loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a\r\nroaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great\r\nfalls of the Missouri. here I arrived about 12 OClock having traveled\r\nby estimate about 15 Miles. I hurryed down the hill which was about 200\r\nfeet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand\r\nspecticle. I took my position on the top of some rocks about 20 feet\r\nhigh opposite the center of the falls. this chain of rocks appear once\r\nto have formed a part of those over which the waters tumbled, but in\r\nthe course of time has been seperated from it to the distance of 150\r\nyards lying prarrallel to it and forming a butment against which the\r\nwater after falling over the precipice beats with great fury; this\r\nbarrier extends on the right to the perpendicular clift which forms\r\nthat board of the river but to the distance of 120 yards next to the\r\nclift it is but a few feet above the level of the water, and here the\r\nwater in very high tides appears to pass in a channel of 40 yds. next\r\nto the higher part of the ledg of rocks; on the left it extends within\r\n80 or ninty yards of the lard. Clift which is also perpendicular;\r\nbetween this abrupt extremity of the ledge of rocks and the\r\nperpendicular bluff the whole body of water passes with incredible\r\nswiftness. immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide;\r\nabout ninty or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth\r\neven sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet,\r\nthe remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest\r\nsight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but\r\nthe irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in\r\nit's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes\r\na thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling\r\nfoam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed\r\nbefore large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is\r\nthrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most\r\nhappily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200\r\nyards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after\r\ndecending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which\r\nI stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous\r\ncourant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight\r\nwhich rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock\r\ndefends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is\r\ndeversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the\r\nlower extremity of the bottom there is a very thick grove of the same\r\nkind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian\r\nlodges formed of sticks. a few small cedar grow near the ledge of rocks\r\nwhere I rest. below the point of these rocks at a small distance the\r\nriver is divided by a large rock which rises several feet above the\r\nwater, and extends downwards with the stream for about 20 yards. about\r\na mile before the water arrives at the pitch it decends very rappidly,\r\nand is confined on the Lard. side by a perpendicular clift of about 100\r\nfeet, on Stard. side it is also perpendicular for about three hundred\r\nyards above the pitch where it is then broken by the discharge of a\r\nsmall ravine, down which the buffaloe have a large beaten road to the\r\nwater, for it is but in very few places that these anamals can obtain\r\nwater near this place owing to the steep and inaccessible banks. I see\r\nseveral skelletons of the buffaloe lying in the edge of the water near\r\nthe Stard. bluff which I presume have been swept down by the current\r\nand precipitated over this tremendious fall. about 300 yards below me\r\nthere is another butment of solid rock with a perpendicular face and\r\nabot 60 feet high which projects from the Stard. side at right angles\r\nto the distance of 134 yds. and terminates the lower part nearly of the\r\nbottom before mentioned; there being a passage arround the end of this\r\nbutment between it and the river of about 20 yardes; here the river\r\nagain assumes it's usual width soon spreading to near 300 yards but\r\nstill continues it's rappidity. from the reflection of the sun on the\r\nspray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull\r\nrainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this\r\nmajestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I\r\nagain viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect\r\nidea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen\r\nacross it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps\r\nsucceed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished\r\nfor the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be\r\nenabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly\r\nmagnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the\r\ncommencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but\r\nthis was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regreted that I had not\r\nbrought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I\r\ncould have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my\r\nreach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to\r\ntraces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of\r\nwhich and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to\r\ngive to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment\r\nfills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of it's kind I\r\nwill venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. I\r\nretired to the shade of a tree where I determined to fix my camp for\r\nthe present and dispatch a man in the morning to inform Capt. C. and\r\nthe party of my success in finding the falls and settle in their minds\r\nall further doubts as to the Missouri. the hunters now arrived loaded\r\nwith excellent buffaloe meat and informed me that they had killed three\r\nvery fat cows about 3/4 of a mile hence. I directed them after they had\r\nrefreshed themselves to go back and butcher them and bring another load\r\nof meat each to our camp determining to employ those who remained with\r\nme in drying meat for the party against their arrival. in about 2 hours\r\nor at 4 OClock P.M. they set out on this duty, and I walked down the\r\nriver about three miles to discover if possible some place to which the\r\ncanoes might arrive or at which they might be drawn on shore in order\r\nto be taken by land above the falls; but returned without effecting\r\neither of these objects; the river was one continued sene of rappids\r\nand cascades which I readily perceived could not be encountered with\r\nour canoes, and the Clifts still retained their perpendicular structure\r\nand were from 150 to 200 feet high; in short the river appears here to\r\nhave woarn a channel in the process of time through a solid rock. on my\r\nreturn I found the party at camp; they had butchered the buffaloe and\r\nbrought in some more meat as I had directed. Goodrich had caught half a\r\ndouzen very fine trout and a number of both species of the white fish.\r\nthese trout are from sixteen to twenty three inches in length,\r\nprecisely resemble our mountain or speckled trout in form and the\r\nposition of their fins, but the specks on these are of a deep black\r\ninstead of the red or goald colour of those common to the U. States.\r\nthese are furnished long sharp teeth on the pallet and tongue and have\r\ngenerally a small dash of red on each side behind the front ventral\r\nfins; the flesh is of a pale yellowish red, or when in good order, of a\r\nrose red.\r\n\r\nI am induced to believe that the Brown, the white and the Grizly bear\r\nof this country are the same species only differing in colour from age\r\nor more probably from the same natural cause that many other anamals of\r\nthe same family differ in colour. one of those which we killed\r\nyesterday was of a creemcoloured white while the other in company with\r\nit was of the common bey or rdish brown, which seems to be the most\r\nusual colour of them. the white one appeared from it's tallons and\r\nteath to be the youngest; it was smaller than the other, and although a\r\nmonstrous beast we supposed that it had not yet attained it's growth\r\nand that it was a little upwards of two years old. the young cubs which\r\nwe have killed have always been of a brownish white, but none of them\r\nas white as that we killed yesterday. one other that we killed sometime\r\nsince which I mentioned sunk under some driftwood and was lost, had a\r\nwhite stripe or list of about eleven inches wide entirely arround his\r\nbody just behind the shoalders, and was much darker than these bear\r\nusually are. the grizly bear we have never yet seen. I have seen their\r\ntallons in possession of the Indians and from their form I am perswaded\r\nif there is any difference between this species and the brown or white\r\nbear it is very inconsiderable. There is no such anamal as a black bear\r\nin this open country or of that species generally denominated the black\r\nbear\r\n\r\nmy fare is really sumptuous this evening; buffaloe's humps, tongues and\r\nmarrowbones, fine trout parched meal pepper and salt, and a good\r\nappetite; the last is not considered the least of the luxuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 13, 1805]\r\nJune 13th Thursday 1805\r\na fair morning, Some dew this morning the Indian woman Verry sick I\r\ngave her a doste of Salts. We Set out early, at a mile & 1/2 passed a\r\nSmall rapid Stream on the Lard Side which heads in a mountain to the S.\r\nE 12 or 15 miles, which at this time covered with Snow, we call this\r\nstream Snow river, as it is the conveyance of the melted snow from that\r\nmountain at present. numbers of gees & goslings, the gees cannot fly at\r\nthis Season--goose berries are ripe and in great abundance, the yellow\r\nCurrent is also Common, not yet ripe Killed a buffalow & Campd on the\r\nLard Side near an old Indian fortified campy one man Sick & 3 with\r\nSwellings, the Indian woman verry Sick.

Clark and ordered him to keep sufficiently near the river to\r\nobserve it's situation in order that he might be enabled to give Capt.\r\nClark an idea of the point at which it would be best to halt to make\r\nour portage. I set one man about preparing a saffold and collecting\r\nwood to dry the meat Sent the others to bring in the ballance of the\r\nbuffaloe meat, or at least the part which the wolves had left us, for\r\nthose fellows are ever at hand and ready to partake with us the moment\r\nwe kill a buffaloe; and there is no means of puting the meat out of\r\ntheir reach in those plains; the two men shortly after returned with\r\nthe meat and informed me that the wolves had devoured the greater part\r\nof the meat. about ten OClock this morning while the men were engaged\r\nwith the meat I took my Gun and espontoon and thought I would walk a\r\nfew miles and see where the rappids termineated above, and return to\r\ndinner. accordingly I set out and proceeded up the river about S. W.\r\nafter passing one continued rappid and three small cascades of abut for\r\nor five feet each at the distance of about five miles I arrived at a\r\nfall of about 19 feet; the river is hereabout 400 yds. wide. this pitch\r\nwhich I called the crooked falls occupys about three fourths of the\r\nwidth of the river, commencing on the South side, extends obliquly\r\nupwards about 150 yds. then forming an accute angle extends downwards\r\nnearly to the commencement of four small Islands lying near the N.\r\nshore; among these Islands and between them and the lower extremity of\r\nthe perpendicular pitch being a distance of 100 yards or upwards, the\r\nwater glides down the side of a sloping rock with a volocity almost\r\nequal to that of it's perpendicular decent. just above this rappid the\r\nriver makes a suddon bend to the right or Northwardly. I should have\r\nreturned from hence but hearing a tremendious roaring above me I\r\ncontinued my rout across the point of a hill a few hundred yards\r\nfurther and was again presented by one of the most beatifull objects in\r\nnature, a cascade of about fifty feet perpendicular streching at\r\nrightangles across the river from side to side to the distance of at\r\nleast a quarter of a mile. here the river pitches over a shelving rock,\r\nwith an edge as regular and as streight as if formed by art, without a\r\nnich or brake in it; the water decends in one even and uninterupted\r\nsheet to the bottom wher dashing against the rocky bottom rises into\r\nfoaming billows of great hight and rappidly glides away, hising\r\nflashing and sparkling as it departs the sprey rises from one extremity\r\nto the other to 50 f. I now thought that if a skillfull painter had\r\nbeen asked to make a beautifull cascade that he would most probably\r\nhave pesented the precise immage of this one; nor could I for some time\r\ndetermine on which of those two great cataracts to bestoe the palm, on\r\nthis or that which I had discovered yesterday; at length I determined\r\nbetween these two great rivals for glory that this was pleasingly\r\nbeautifull, while the other was sublimely grand. I had scarcely infixed\r\nmy eyes from this pleasing object before I discovered another fall\r\nabove at the distance of half a mile; thus invited I did not once think\r\nof returning but hurried thither to amuse myself with this newly\r\ndiscovered object. I found this to be a cascade of about 14 feet\r\npossessing a perpendicular pitch of about 6 feet. this was tolerably\r\nregular streching across the river from bank to bank where it was about\r\na quarter of a mile wide; in any other neighbourhood but this, such a\r\ncascade would probably be extoled for it's beaty and magnifficence, but\r\nhere I passed it by with but little attention, determining as I had\r\nproceded so far to continue my rout to the head of the rappids if it\r\nshould even detain me all night. at every rappid cateract and cascade I\r\ndiscovered that the bluffs grew lower or that the bed of the river rose\r\nnearer to a level with the plains. still pursuing the river with it's\r\ncourse about S. W. passing a continued sene of rappids and small\r\ncascades, at the distance of 21/2 miles I arrived at another cataract\r\nof 26 feet. this is not immediately perpendicular, a rock about 1/3 of\r\nit's decent seems to protrude to a small distance and receives the\r\nwater in it's passage downwards and gives a curve to the water tho it\r\nfalls mostly with a regular and smoth sheet. the river is near six\r\nhundred yards wide at this place, a beatifull level plain on the S.\r\nside only a few feet above the level of the pitch; on the N. side where\r\nI am the country is More broken and immediately behind me near the\r\nriver a high hill. below this fall at a little distance a beatifull\r\nlittle Island well timbered is situated about the middle of the river.\r\nin this Island on a Cottonwood tree an Eagle has placed her nest; a\r\nmore inaccessable spot I beleive she could not have found; for neither\r\nman nor beast dare pass those gulphs which seperate her little domain\r\nfrom the shores. the water is also broken in such manner as it decends\r\nover this pitch that the mist or sprey rises to a considerable hight.\r\nthis fall is certainly much the greatest I ever behald except those two\r\nwhich I have mentioned below. it is incomparably a geater cataract and\r\na more noble interesting object than the celibrated falls of Potomac or\r\nSoolkiln &c. just above this is another cascade of about 5 feet, above\r\nwhich the water as far as I could see began to abate of it's valosity,\r\nand I therefore determined to ascend the hill behind me which promised\r\na fine prospect of the adjacent country, nor was I disappointed on my\r\narrival at it's summit. from hence I overlooked a most beatifull and\r\nextensive plain reaching from the river to the base of the Snowclad\r\nmountains to the S. and S. West; I also observed the missoury streching\r\nit's meandering course to the South through this plain to a great\r\ndistance filled to it's even and grassey brim; another large river\r\nflowed in on it's Western side about four miles above me and extended\r\nitself though a level and fertile valley of 3 miles in width a great\r\ndistance to the N. W. rendered more conspicuous by the timber which\r\ngarnished it's borders. in these plains and more particularly in the\r\nvalley just below me immence herds of buffaloe are feeding. the\r\nmissouri just above this hill makes a bend to the South where it lies a\r\nsmoth even and unruffled sheet of water of nearly a mile in width\r\nbearing on it's watry bosome vast flocks of geese which feed at\r\npleasure in the delightfull pasture on either border. the young geese\r\nare now completely feathered except the wings which both in the young\r\nand old are yet deficient. after feasting my eyes on this ravishing\r\nprospect and resting myself a few minutes I determined to procede as\r\nfar as the river which I saw discharge itself on the West side of the\r\nMissouri convinced that it was the river which the Indians call\r\nmedicine river and which they informed us fell into the Missouri just\r\nabove the falls I decended the hills and directed my course to the bend\r\nof the Missouri near which there was a herd of at least a thousand\r\nbuffaloe; here I thought it would be well to kill a buffaloe and leave\r\nhim untill my return from the river and if I then found that I had not\r\ntime to get back to camp this evening to remain all night here there\r\nbeing a few sticks of drift wood lying along shore which would answer\r\nfor my fire, and a few sattering cottonwood trees a few hundred yards\r\nbelow which would afford me at least a semblance of a shelter. under\r\nthis impression I scelected a fat buffaloe and shot him very well,\r\nthrough the lungs; while I was gazeing attentively on the poor anamal\r\ndischarging blood in streams from his mouth and nostrils, expecting him\r\nto fall every instant, and having entirely forgotton to reload my\r\nrifle, a large white, or reather brown bear, had perceived and crept on\r\nme within 20 steps before I discovered him; in the first moment I drew\r\nup my gun to shoot, but at the same instant recolected that she was not\r\nloaded and that he was too near for me to hope to perform this\r\nopperation before he reached me, as he was then briskly advancing on\r\nme; it was an open level plain, not a bush within miles nor a tree\r\nwithin less than three hundred yards of me; the river bank was sloping\r\nand not more than three feet above the level of the water; in short\r\nthere was no place by means of which I could conceal myself from this\r\nmonster untill I could charge my rifle; in this situation I thought of\r\nretreating in a brisk walk as fast as he was advancing untill I could\r\nreach a tree about 300 yards below me, but I had no sooner terned\r\nmyself about but he pitched at me, open mouthed and full speed, I ran\r\nabout 80 yards and found he gained on me fast, I then run into the\r\nwater the idea struk me to get into the water to such debth that I\r\ncould stand and he would be obliged to swim, and that I could in that\r\nsituation defend myself with my espontoon; accordingly I ran haistily\r\ninto the water about waist deep, and faced about and presented the\r\npoint of my espontoon, at this instant he arrived at the edge of the\r\nwater within about 20 feet of me; the moment I put myself in this\r\nattitude of defence he sudonly wheeled about as if frightened, declined\r\nthe combat on such unequal grounds, and retreated with quite as great\r\nprecipitation as he had just before pursued me. as soon as I saw him\r\nrun off in that manner I returned to the shore and charged my gun,\r\nwhich I had still retained in my hand throughout this curious\r\nadventure. I saw him run through the level open plain about three\r\nmiles, till he disappeared in the woods on medecine river; during the\r\nwhole of this distance he ran at full speed, sometimes appearing to\r\nlook behind him as if he expected pursuit. I now began to reflect on\r\nthis novil occurrence and indeavoured to account for this sudden\r\nretreat of the bear. I at first thought that perhaps he had not smelt\r\nme before he arrived at the waters edge so near me, but I then\r\nreflected that he had pursued me for about 80 or 90 yards before I took\r\nthe water and on examination saw the grownd toarn with his tallons\r\nimmediately on the impression of my steps; and the cause of his allarm\r\nstill remains with me misterious and unaccountable.--so it was and I\r\nfeelt myself not a little gratifyed that he had declined the combat. My\r\ngun reloaded I felt confidence once more in my strength; and determined\r\nnot to be thwarted in my design of visiting medicine river, but\r\ndetermined never again to suffer my peice to be longer empty than the\r\ntime she necessarily required to charge her. I passed through the plain\r\nnearly in the direction which the bear had run to medecine river, found\r\nit a handsome stream, about 200 yds. wide with a gentle current,\r\napparently deep, it's waters clear, and banks which were formed\r\nprincipally of darkbrown and blue clay were about the hight of those of\r\nthe Missouri or from 3 to 5 feet; yet they had not the appearance of\r\never being overflown, a circumstance, which I did not expect so\r\nimmediately in the neighbourhood of the mountains, from whence I should\r\nhave supposed, that sudden and immence torrants would issue at certain\r\nseasons of the year; but the reverse is absolutely the case. I am\r\ntherefore compelled to beleive that the snowey mountains yeald their\r\nwarters slowly, being partially effected every day by the influence of\r\nthe sun only, and never suddonly melted down by haisty showers of rain.\r\n\r\nhaving examined Medecine river I now determined to return, having by my\r\nestimate about 12 miles to walk. I looked at my watch and found it was\r\nhalf after six P.M.--in returning through the level bottom of Medecine\r\nriver and about 200 yards distant from the Missouri, my direction led\r\nme directly to an anamal that I at first supposed was a wolf; but on\r\nnearer approach or about sixty paces distant I discovered that it was\r\nnot, it's colour was a brownish yellow; it was standing near it's\r\nburrow, and when I approached it thus nearly, it couched itself down\r\nlike a cat looking immediately at me as if it designed to spring on me.\r\nI took aim at it and fired, it instantly disappeared in it's burrow; I\r\nloaded my gun and exmined the place which was dusty and saw the track\r\nfrom which I am still further convinced that it was of the tiger kind.\r\nwhether I struck it or not I could not determine, but I am almost\r\nconfident that I did; my gun is true and I had a steady rest by means\r\nof my espontoon, which I have found very serviceable to me in this way\r\nin the open plains. It now seemed to me that all the beasts of the\r\nneighbourhood had made a league to distroy me, or that some fortune was\r\ndisposed to amuse herself at my expence, for I had not proceded more\r\nthan three hundred yards from the burrow of this tyger cat, before\r\nthree bull buffaloe, which wer feeding with a large herd about half a\r\nmile from me on my left, seperated from the herd and ran full speed\r\ntowards me, I thought at least to give them some amusement and altered\r\nmy direction to meet them; when they arrived within a hundred yards\r\nthey mad a halt, took a good view of me and retreated with\r\nprecipitation. I then continued my rout homewards passed the buffaloe\r\nwhich I had killed, but did not think it prudent to remain all night at\r\nthis place which really from the succession of curious adventures wore\r\nthe impression on my mind of inchantment; at sometimes for a moment I\r\nthought it might be a dream, but the prickley pears which pierced my\r\nfeet very severely once in a while, particularly after it grew dark,\r\nconvinced me that I was really awake, and that it was necessary to make\r\nthe best of my way to camp. it was sometime after dark before I\r\nreturned to the party; I found them extremely uneasy for my safety;\r\nthey had formed a thousand conjectures, all of which equally forboding\r\nmy death, which they had so far settled among them, that they had\r\nalready agreed on the rout which each should take in the morning to\r\nsurch for me. I felt myself much fortiegued, but eat a hearty supper\r\nand took a good night's rest.--the weather being warm I had left my\r\nleather over shirt and had woarn only a yellow flannin one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 14, 1805]\r\nJune 14th Friday 1805\r\na fine morning, the Indian woman complaining all night & excessively\r\nbad this morning--her case is Somewhat dangerous--two men with the\r\nTooth ake 2 with Turners, & one man with a Tumor & Slight fever passed\r\nthe Camp Capt.

I amused myself in fishing, and sleeping away the fortiegues of\r\nyesterday. I caught a number of very fine trout which I made Goodrich\r\ndry; goodrich also caught about two douzen and several small cat of a\r\nyellow colour which would weigh about 4 lbs. the tails was seperated\r\nwith a deep angular nitch like that of the white cat of the missouri\r\nfrom which indeed they differed only in colour. when I awoke from my\r\nsleep today I found a large rattlesnake coiled on the leaning trunk of\r\na tree under the shade of which I had been lying at the distance of\r\nabout ten feet from him. I killed the snake and found that he had 176\r\nscuta on the abdomen and i'7 half formed scuta on the tale; it was of\r\nthe same kinde which I had frequently seen before; they do not differ\r\nin their colours from the rattle snake common to the middle attlantic\r\nstates, but considerably in the form and figures of those colours. This\r\nevening after dark Joseph Fields returned and informed me that Capt\r\nClark had arrived with the party at the foot of a rappid about 5 miles\r\nbelow which he did not think proper to ascend and would wait my arrival\r\nthere. I had discovered from my journey yesterday that a portage on\r\nthis side of the river will be attended by much difficulty in\r\nconsequence of several deep ravines which intersect the plains nearly\r\nat right angles with the river to a considerable distance, while the\r\nSouth side appears to be a delighfull smoth unbroken plain; the\r\nbearings of the river also make it pobable that the portage will be\r\nshorter on that side than on this.--I directed Fields to return early\r\nin the morning to Capt. C. and request him to send up a party of men\r\nfor the dryed meat which we had made. I finde a very heavy due on the\r\ngrass about my camp every morning which no doubt procedes from the mist\r\nof the falls, as it takes place no where in the plains nor on the river\r\nexcept here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 15, 1805]\r\nJune the 15th Satturday 1805\r\na fair morning and worm, we Set out at the usial time and proceeded on\r\nwith great dificuelty as the river is more rapid we can hear the falls\r\nthis morning verry distinctly--our Indian woman Sick &low Spirited I\r\ngave her the bark & apply it exteranaly to her region which revived her\r\nmuch. the curt. excessively rapid and dificuelt to assend great numbers\r\nof dangerous places, and the fatigue which we have to encounter is\r\nincretiatable the men in the water from morning untill night hauling\r\nthe Cord & boats walking on Sharp rocks and round Sliperery Stones\r\nwhich alternately cut their feet & throw them down, not with Standing\r\nall this dificuelty they go with great chearfulness, aded to those\r\ndificuelties the rattle Snakes inumerable & require great caution to\r\nprevent being bitten.--we passed a Small river on the Lard Side about\r\n30 yards wide verry rapid which heads in the mountains to the S.

I\r\nSent up this river 5 miles, it has Some timber in its bottoms and a\r\nfall of 15 feet at one place, above this river the bluffs are of red\r\nearth mixed with Stratums of black Stone, below this little river, we\r\npass a white clay which mixes with water like flour in every respect,\r\nthe Indian woman much wors this evening, She will not take any medison,\r\nher husband petetions to return &c., river more rapid late in the\r\nevening we arrived at a rapid which appeared So bad that I did not\r\nthink it prudent to attempt passing of it this evening as it was now\r\nlate, we Saw great numbers of Gees Ducks, Crows Blackbirds &c Geese &\r\nDucks with their young. after Landing I detached Joseph Fields to Capt.\r\nLewis to let him know where I was &c river rises a little this evening\r\nwe could not get a Sufficency of wood for our use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 16, 1805]\r\nSunday June 16th 1805\r\nJ. Fields set out early on his return to the lower camp, at noon the\r\nmen arrived and shortly after I set out with them to rejoin the party.\r\nwe took with us the dryed meat consisting of about 600 lbs. and several\r\ndouzen of dryed trout. about 2 P.M. I reached the camp found the Indian\r\nwoman extreemly ill and much reduced by her indisposition. this gave me\r\nsome concern as well for the poor object herself, then with a young\r\nchild in her arms, as from the consideration of her being our only\r\ndependence for a friendly negociation with the Snake Indians on whom we\r\ndepend for horses to assist us in our portage from the Missouri to the\r\ncolumbia River. I now informed Capt. C. of my discoveries with rispect\r\nto the most proper side for our portage, and of it's great length,\r\nwhich I could not estimate at less than 16 miles. Capt. C. had already\r\nsent two men this morning to examine the country on the S. side of the\r\nriver; he now passed over with the party to that side and fixed a camp\r\nabout a mile blow the entrance of a Creek where there was a sufficient\r\nquantity of wood for fuel, an article which can be obtained but in few\r\nplaces in this neighbourhood. after discharging the loads four of the\r\ncanoes were sent back to me, which by means of strong ropes we hawled\r\nabove the rappid and passed over to the south side from whence the\r\nwater not being rappid we can readily convey them into the creek by\r\nmeans of which we hope to get them on the high plain with more ease.\r\none of the small canoes was left below this rappid in order to pass and\r\nrepass the river for the purpose of hunting as well as to procure the\r\nwater of the Sulpher spring, the virtues of which I now resolved to try\r\non the Indian woman. this spring is situated about 200 yards from the\r\nMissouri on the N. E. side nearly opposite to the entrance of a large\r\ncreek; it discharges itself into the Missouri over a precepice of rock\r\nabout 25 feet, forming a pretty little ____ the water is as transparent\r\nas possible strongly impregnated with sulpher, and I suspect Iron also,\r\nas the colour of the hills and bluffs in the neighbourhood indicate the\r\nexistence of that metal. the water to all appearance is precisely\r\nsimilar to that of Bowyer's Sulpher spring in Virginia. Capt. Clark\r\ndetermined to set out in the morning to examine and survey the portage,\r\nand discover the best rout. as the distance was too great to think of\r\ntransporting the canoes and baggage on the men's shoulders, we\r\nscelected six men, and ordered them to look out some timber this\r\nevening, and early in the morning to set about making a parsel of truck\r\nwheels in order to convey our canoes and baggage over the portage. we\r\ndetermined to leave the white perogue at this place, and substitute the\r\nIron boat, and also to make a further deposit of a part of our stores.\r\nin the evening the men who had been sent out to examine the country and\r\nmade a very unfavourable report. they informed us that the creek just\r\nabove us and two deep ravenes still higher up cut the plain between the\r\nriver and mountain in such a manner, that in their opinions a portage\r\nfor the canoes on this side was impracticable. good or bad we must make\r\nthe portage. notwithstanding this report I am still convinced from the\r\nview I had of the country the day before yesterday that a good portage\r\nmay be had on this side at least much better than on the other, and\r\nmuch nearer also. I found that two dozes of barks and opium which I had\r\ngiven her since my arrival had produced an alteration in her pulse for\r\nthe better; they were now much fuller and more regular. I caused her to\r\ndrink the mineral water altogether. wen I first came down I found that\r\nher pulse were scarcely perceptible, very quick frequently irregular\r\nand attended with strong nervous symptoms, that of the twitching of the\r\nfingers and leaders of the arm; now the pulse had become regular much\r\nfuller and a gentle perspiration had taken place; the nervous symptoms\r\nhave also in a great measure abated, and she feels herself much freeer\r\nfrom pain. she complains principally of the lower region of the\r\nabdomen, I therefore continued the cataplasms of barks and laudnumn\r\nwhich had been previously used by my friend Capt Clark. I beleive her\r\ndisorder originated principally from an obstruction of the mensis in\r\nconsequence of taking could.--I determined to remain at this camp in\r\norder to make some celestial observations, restore the sick woman, and\r\nhave all matters in a state of readiness to commence the portage\r\nimmediately on the return of Capt. Clark, who now furnished me with the\r\ndayly occurrences which had taken place with himself and party since\r\nour seperation which I here enter in his own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 16, 1805]\r\nJune 16th of Sunday 1805\r\nSome rain last night a cloudy morning wind hard from the S.

Clark set out early this morning with five men to examine the\r\ncountry and survey the river and portage as had been concerted last\r\nevening. I set six men at work to pepare four sets of truck wheels with\r\ncouplings, toungs and bodies, that they might either be used without\r\nthe bodies for transporting our canoes, or with them in transporting\r\nour baggage I found that the Elk skins I had prepared for my boat were\r\ninsufficient to compleat her, some of them having become dammaged by\r\nthe weather and being frequently wet; to make up this deficiency I sent\r\nout two hunters this morning to hunt Elk; the ballance of the party I\r\nemployed first in unloading the white perogue, which we intend leaving\r\nat this place, and bring the whole of our baggage together and\r\narranging it in proper order near our camp. this duty being compleated\r\nI employed them in taking five of the small canoes up the creek which\r\nwe now call portage creek about 13/4 miles; here I had them taken out\r\nand lyed in the sun to dry. from this place ther is a gradual ascent to\r\nthe top of the high plain to which we can now take them with ease; the\r\nbluffs of this creek below and those of the river above it's entrance\r\nare so steep that it would be almost impracticable to have gotten them\r\non the plain. we found much difficulty in geting the canoes up this\r\ncreek to the distance we were compelled to take them, in consequence of\r\nthe rappids and rocks which obstruct the channel of the creek. one of\r\nthe canoes overset and was very near injuring 2 men essencially. just\r\nabove the canoes the creek has a perpendicular fall of 5 feet and the\r\ncliffts again become very steep and high. we were fortunate enough to\r\nfind one cottonwood tree just below the entrance of portage creek that\r\nwas large enough to make our carrage wheels about 22 Inches in\r\ndiameter; fortunate I say because I do not beleive that we could find\r\nanother of the same size perfectly sound within 20 miles of us. the\r\ncottonwood which we are obliged to employ in the other parts of the\r\nwork is extreemly illy calculated for it being soft and brittle. we\r\nhave made two axeltrees of the mast of the white peroge, which I hope\r\nwill answer tolerably well tho it is reather small. The Indian woman\r\nmuch better today, I have still continued the same course of medecine;\r\nshe is free from pain clear of fever, her pulse regular, and eats as\r\nheartily as I am willing to permit her of broiled buffaloe well\r\nseasoned with pepper and salt and rich soope of the same meat; I think\r\ntherefore that there is every rational hope of her recovery. saw a vast\r\nnumber of buffaloe feeding in every direction arround us in the plains,\r\nothers coming down in large herds to water at the river; the fragments\r\nof many carcases of these poor anamals daily pass down the river, thus\r\nmangled I pesume in decending those immence cataracts above us. as the\r\nbuffaloe generally go in large herds to water and the passages to the\r\nriver about the falls are narrow and steep the hinder part of the herd\r\npress those in front out of their debth and the water instatly takes\r\nthem over the cataracts where they are instantly crushed to death\r\nwithout the possibility of escaping. in this manner I have seen ten or\r\na douzen disappear in a few minutes. their mangled carcases ly along\r\nthe shores below the falls in considerable quantities and afford fine\r\namusement for the bear wolves and birds of prey; this may be one reason\r\nand I think not a bad one either that the bear are so tenatious of\r\ntheir right of soil in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 17, 1805]\r\nJune 17th Monday 1805\r\na fine morning wind as usial Capt.

Of 93 yards\r\nhaveing a Small bottom of timber on the Stard Side which is definded by\r\na rock, rangeing Cross wise the river a little below the Shoot, a Short\r\ndistance below this Cataract a large rock divides the Stream, I in\r\nassendending the Clifts to take the hith of the fall was near Slipping\r\ninto the water, at which place I must have been Sucked under in an\r\ninstant, and with deficuelty and great risque I assended again, and\r\ndecended the Clift lower down (but few places Can be descended to the\r\nriver) and took the hight with as much accuricy as possible with a\r\nSpirit Leavels &c. dined at a fine Spring 200 yards below the pitch\r\nnear which place 4 Cotton willow trees grew. on one of them I marked my\r\nname the date, and hight of the falls,--we then proceeded up on the\r\nriver passing a Continued Cascade & rapid to a fall of 19 feet at 4\r\nSmall Islands, this fall is diaguanally across the river from the Lard\r\nSide, forming an angle of 3/4 of the width from the Lard. from which\r\nSide it pitches for 2/3 of that distance. on the Stard Side is a rapid\r\ndecline--below this Shoot a Deep revein falls in which we Camped for\r\nthe night which was Cold (The mountains in every derection has Snow on\r\nThem) The plain to our left is leavel we Saw one Bear & inumerable\r\nnumbers of Buffalow, I Saw 2 herds of those animals watering\r\nimmediately above a considerable rapid, they decended by a narrow pass\r\nto the bottom Small, the rier forced those forwd into the water Some of\r\nwhich was taken down in an instant, and Seen no more others made Shore\r\nwith difficuelty, I beheld 40 or 50 of those Swimming at the Same time\r\nthose animals in this way are lost and accounts for the number of\r\nbuffalow carcases below the rapids\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 18, 1805]\r\nTuesday June 18th 1805.\r\nThis morning I employed all hands in drawing the perogue on shore in a\r\nthick bunch of willow bushes some little distance below our camp;\r\nfastened her securely, drove out the plugs of the gage holes of her\r\nbottom and covered her with bushes and driftwood to shelter her from\r\nthe sun. I now scelected a place for a cash and set tree men at work to\r\ncomplete it, and employed all others except those about the waggons, in\r\noverhawling airing and repacking our indian goods ammunition, provision\r\nand stores of every discription which required inspection. examined the\r\nframe of my Iron boat and found all the parts complete except one\r\nscrew, which the ingenuity of Sheilds can readily replace, a resource\r\nwhich we have very frequent occasion for. about 12 O'Clk. the hunters\r\nreturned; they had killed 10 deer but no Elk. I begin to fear that we\r\nshall have some difficulty in procuring skins for the boat. I wold\r\nprefer those of the Elk because I beleive them more durable and strong\r\nthan those of the Buffaloe, and that they will not shrink so much in\r\ndrying. we saw a herd of buffaloe come down to water at the sulpher\r\nspring this evening, I dispatched some hunters to kill some of them,\r\nand a man also for a cask of mineral water. the hunters soon killed two\r\nof them in fine order and returned with a good quantity of the flesh,\r\nhaving left the remainder in a situation that it will not spoil\r\nprovided the wolves do not visit it. The waggons are completed this\r\nevening, and appear as if they would answer the purpose very well if\r\nthe axetrees prove sufficiently strong. the wind blew violently this\r\nevening, as they frequently do in this open country where there is not\r\na tree to brake or oppose their force. The Indian woman is recovering\r\nfast she set up the greater part of the day and walked out for the fist\r\ntime since she arrived here; she eats hartily and is free from fever or\r\npain. I continue same course of medecine and regimen except that I\r\nadded one doze of 15 drops of the oil of vitriol today about noon.\r\n\r\nThere is a species of goosberry which grows very common about here in\r\nopen situations among the rocks on the sides of the clifts. they are\r\nnow ripe of a pale red colour, about the size of a common goosberry.\r\nand like it is an ovate pericarp of soft pulp invelloping a number of\r\nsmal whitish coloured seeds; the pulp is a yelloish slimy muselaginous\r\nsubstance of a sweetish and pinelike tast, not agreeable to me. the\r\nsurface of the berry is covered with a glutinous adhesive matter, and\r\nthe frut altho ripe retains it's withered corollar. this shrub seldom\r\nrises more than two feet high and is much branched, the leaves resemble\r\nthose of the common goosberry only not so large; it has no thorns. the\r\nberry is supported by seperate peduncles or footstalks of half an inch\r\nin length. immence quantities of small grasshoppers of a brown colour\r\nin the plains, they no doubt contribute much to keep the grass as low\r\nas we find it which is not generally more than three inches, the grass\r\nis a narrow leaf, soft, and affords a fine pasture for the Buffaloe.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 18, 1805]\r\nJune 18th Tuesday 1805\r\nwe Set out early and arrived at the second great Cataract at about 200\r\nyds above the last of 19 feet pitch--this is one of the grandest views\r\nin nature and by far exceeds any thing I ever Saw, the Missouri falling\r\nover a Shelveing rock for 47 feet 8 Inches with a Cascade &c of 14 feet\r\n7 Inches above the Shoot for a 1/4 mile I decended the Clift below this\r\nCateract with ease measured the hight of the purpendicular fall of 47\r\nfeet 8 Inches at which place the river is 473 yards wide as also the\r\nhight of the Cascade &c. a continuel mist quite across this fall* after\r\nwhich we proceeded on up the river a little more than a mile to the\r\nlargest fountain or Spring I ever Saw, and doubt if it is not the\r\nlargest in America Known, this water boils up from under th rocks near\r\nthe edge of the river and falls imediately into the river 8 feet and\r\nkeeps its Colour for 1/2 a mile which is emencely Clear and of a bluish\r\nCast, proceeded on up the river passed a Succession of rapids to the\r\nnext great fall of 26 Ft. 5 I. river 580 yards wide this fall is not\r\nintirely perpdincular a Short bench gives a Curve to the water as it\r\nfalls a butifull Small Island at the foot of this fall near the Center\r\nof the Channel Covered with trees, the Missouri at this fall is 36\r\nyards wide, a Considerable mist rises at this fall ocasionally, from\r\nthis pitch to the head of the rapids is one mile & has a fall of 20\r\nfeet, this is also a handsome Scenery a fall in an open leavel plain,\r\nafter takeing the hight & measureing the river proceeded on, Saw a\r\ngange of Buffalow Swiming the river above the falls, Several of which\r\nwas drawn in to the rapids and with dificuelty mad Shore half drowned,\r\nwe killed one of those Cows & took as much meat as we wished. emence\r\nherds of those animals in every direction, passed 2 groves in the Point\r\njust above the rapids & dined in one opposit the mouth of Medison\r\nRiver, which fails in on the Stard.

I also dispatched George Drewyer Reubin Fields and\r\nGeorge Shannon on the North side of the Missouri with orders to proceed\r\nto the entrance of Medecine river and indeavour to kill some Elk in\r\nthat neigh-bourhood. as there is more timber on that river than the\r\nMissouri I expect that the Elk are more plenty. The cash completed\r\ntoday. The wind blew violently the greater part of the day. the Indian\r\nwoman was much better this morning she walked out and gathered a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the white apples of which she eat so heartily\r\nin their raw state, together with a considerable quantity of dryed fish\r\nwithout my knowledge that she complained very much and her fever again\r\nreturned. I rebuked Sharbono severely for suffering her to indulge\r\nherself with such food he being privy to it and having been previously\r\ntold what she must only eat. I now gave her broken dozes of diluted\r\nnitre untill it produced perspiration and at 10 P.M. 30 drops of\r\nlaudnum which gave her a tolerable nights rest. I amused myself in\r\nfishing several hours today and caught a number of both species of the\r\nwhite fish, but no trout nor Cat. I employed the men in making up our\r\nbaggage in proper packages for transportation; and waxed the stoppers\r\nof my powder canesters anew. had the frame of my Iron boat clensed of\r\nrust and well greased. in the evening the men mended their mockersons\r\nand preparedthemselves for the portage. After dark my dog barked very\r\nmuch and seemed extreemly uneasy which was unusual with him; I ordered\r\nthe sergt. of the guard to reconniter with two men, thinking it\r\npossible that some Indians might be about to pay us a visit, or perhaps\r\na white bear; he returned soon after & reported that he believed the\r\ndog had been baying a buffaloe bull which had attempted to swim the\r\nriver just above our camp but had been beten down by the stream landed\r\na little below our camp on the same side & run off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 19, 1805]\r\nJune 19th Wednesday 1805\r\nWe went on the Island to hunt the White bear this morning but Could not\r\nfind him, after plotting my Courses &c. I deturmined to dry the meat we\r\nkilled and leave here, and proceed up the river as far as it bent to\r\nthe S. E. and examine a Small Creek above our Camp, I Set out and found\r\nthe Creek only Contained back water for 1 mile up, ascend near the\r\nMissouri 3 miles to the bend, from which place it turnd. Westerly, from\r\nthis bend I with 2 men went forward towards the Camp of the party to\r\nexamine the best ground for the portage, the little Creek has verry\r\nextencive bottoms which Spread out into a varriety of leavl rich\r\nbottoms quite to the mountains to the East, between those bottoms is\r\nhills low and Stoney on this declivity where it is Steep. I returned to\r\nCamp late and deturmined that the best nearest and most eassy rout\r\nwould be from the lower part of the 3rd or white bear Island, the wind\r\nall this day blew violently hard from the S W. off the Snowey\r\nmountains, Cool, in my last rout I lost a part of my notes which could\r\nnot be found as the wind must have blown them to a great distance.\r\nSummer duck Setting great numbers of buffalow all about our Camp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 20, 1805]\r\nThursday June 20th 1805.\r\nThis morning we had but little to do; waiting the return of Capt.\r\nClark; I am apprehensive from his stay that the portage is longer than\r\nwe had calculated on. I sent out 4 hunters this morning on the opposite\r\nside of the river to kill buffaloe; the country being more broken on\r\nthat side and cut with ravenes they can get within shoot of the\r\nbuffaloe with more ease and certainty than on this side of the river.\r\nmy object is if possible while we have now but little to do, to lay in\r\na large stock of dryed meat at this end of the portage to subsist the\r\nparty while engaged in the transportation of our baggage &c, to the\r\nend, that they may not be taken from this duty when once commenced in\r\norder to surch for the necessary subsistence. The Indian woman is qute\r\nfree from pain and fever this morning and appears to be in a fair way\r\nfor recovery, she has been walking about and fishing. In the evening 2\r\nof the hunters returned and informed me that they had killed eleven\r\nbuffaloe eight of which were in very fine order, I sent off all hands\r\nimmediately to bring in the meat they soon returned with about half of\r\nthe best meat leaving three men to remain all night in order to secure\r\nthe ballance. the bufhaloe are in inimence numbers, they have been\r\nconstantly coming down in large herds to water opposite to us for some\r\nhours sometimes two or three herds wartering at the same instant and\r\nscarcely disappear before others supply their places. they appear to\r\nmake great use of the mineral water, whether this be owing to it's\r\nbeing more convenient to them than the river or that they actually\r\nprefer it I am at a loss to determine for they do not use it\r\ninvaryably, but sometimes pass at no great distance from it and water\r\nat the river. brackish water or that of a dark colour impregnated with\r\nmineral salts such as I have frequenly mentioned on the Missouri is\r\nfound in small quantities in some of the steep ravenes on the N. side\r\nof the river opposite to us and the falls. Capt. Clark and party\r\nreturned late this evening when he gave me the following relation of\r\nhis rout and the occurrences which had taken place with them since\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\nCapt. Clark now furnished me with the field notes of the survey which\r\nhe had made of the Missouri and it's Cataracts cascades &c. from the\r\nentrance of portage Creek to the South Eastwardly bend of the Missouri\r\nabove the White bear Islands, which are as follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 20, 1805]\r\nJune 20th Thursday 1805\r\na Cloudy morning, a hard wind all night and this morning, I direct\r\nStakes to be Cut to Stick up in the prarie to Show the way for the\r\nparty to transport the baggage &c. &c. we Set out early on the portage,\r\nSoon after we Set out it began to rain and continued a Short time we\r\nproceeded on thro a tolerable leavel plain, and found the hollow of a\r\nDeep rivein to obstruct our rout as it Could not be passed with Canos &\r\nbaggage for Some distance above the place we Struck it I examined it\r\nfor Some time and finding it late deturmined to Strike the river & take\r\nits Course & distance to Camp which I accordingly did the wind hard\r\nfrom the S. W. a fair after noon, the river on both Sides Cut with\r\nraveins Some of which is passes thro Steep Clifts into the river, the\r\nCountrey above the falls & up the Medison river is leavel, with low\r\nbanks, a chain of mountains to the west Some part of which particuler\r\nthose to the N W. & S W are Covered with Snow and appear verry high--I\r\nSaw a rattle Snake in an open plain 2 miles from any Creek or wood.\r\nWhen I arrived at Camp found all well with great quantites of meet, the\r\nCanoes Capt. Lewis had Carried up the Creek 1 mile to a good place to\r\nassend the band & taken up. Not haveing Seen the Snake Indians or\r\nknowing in fact whither to Calculate on their friendship or hostillity,\r\nwe have Conceived our party Sufficiently Small, and therefore have\r\nConcluded not to dispatch a Canoe with a part of our men to St. Louis\r\nas we have intended early in the Spring. we fear also that Such a\r\nmeasure might also discourage those who would in Such Case remain, and\r\nmigh possibly hazard the fate of the expedition. we have never hinted\r\nto any one of the party that we had Such a Scheem in contemplation, and\r\nall appear perfectly to have made up their minds, to Succeed in the\r\nexpedition or perish in the attempt. we all believe that we are about\r\nto enter on the most perilous and dificuelt part of our Voyage, yet I\r\nSee no one repineing; all appear ready to meet those dificuelties which\r\nawait us with resolution and becomeing fortitude.\r\n\r\nWe had a heavy dew this morning. the Clouds near those mountains rise\r\nSuddonly and discharge their Contents partially on the neighbouring\r\nPlains; the Same Cloud discharge hail alone in one part, hail and rain\r\nin another and rain only in a third all within the Space of a fiew\r\nMiles; and on the Mountains to the South & S. E. of us Sometimes Snow.\r\nat present there is no Snow on those mountains; that which covered them\r\na fiew days ago has all disappeared. the Mountains to the N. W. and\r\nWest of us are Still entirely Covered are white and glitter with the\r\nreflection of the Sun.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the Clouds that pervale at this Season of the\r\nyear reach the Summits of those lofty mountains; and if they do the\r\nprobability is that they deposit Snow only for there has been no\r\nproceptable diminution of the Snow which they Contain Since we first\r\nSaw them. I have thought it probable that these mountains might have\r\nderived their appellation of Shineing Mountains, from their glittering\r\nappearance when the Sun Shines in certain directions on the Snow which\r\nCover them.\r\n\r\nDureing the time of my being on the Plains and above the falls I as\r\nalso all my party repeatedly heard a nois which proceeded from a\r\nDirection a little to the N. of West, as loud and resembling precisely\r\nthe discharge of a piece of ordinance of 6 pounds at the distance of 5\r\nor six miles. I was informed of it Several times by the men J. Fields\r\nparticularly before I paid any attention to it, thinking it was thunder\r\nmost probably which they had mistaken. at length walking in the plains\r\nyesterday near the most extreem S. E. bend of the River above the falls\r\nI heard this nois very distinctly, it was perfectly calm clear and not\r\na Cloud to be Seen, I halted and listened attentively about two hour\r\ndureing which time I heard two other discharges, and took the direction\r\nof the Sound with my pocket Compass which was as nearly West from me as\r\nI could estimate from the Sound. I have no doubt but if I had leasure I\r\ncould find from whence it issued. I have thought it probable that it\r\nmight be caused by running water in Some of the caverns of those emence\r\nmountains, on the principal of the blowing caverns; but in Such case\r\nthe Sounds would be periodical and regular, which is not the Case with\r\nthis, being Sometimes heard once only and at other times Several\r\ndischarges in quick Succession. it is heard also at different times of\r\nthe day and night. I am at a great loss to account for this Phenomenon.\r\nI well recollect hereing the Minitarees Say that those Rocky Mountains\r\nmake a great noise, but they could not tell me the Cause, neither Could\r\nthey inform me of any remarkable substance or situation in these\r\nmountains which would autherise a conjecture of a probable cause of\r\nthis noise-. it is probable that the large river just above those Great\r\nfalls which heads in the detection of the noise has taken it's name\r\nMedicine River from this unaccountable rumbling Sound, which like all\r\nunacountable thing with the Indians of the Missouri is Called Medicine.\r\n\r\nThe Ricaras inform us of the black mountains making a Simalar noise &c.\r\n&c. and maney other wonderfull tales of those Rocky mountains and those\r\ngreat falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 21, 1805]\r\nFriday June 21st 1805.\r\nThis morning I employed the greater part of the men in transporting a\r\npart of the bagage over portage creek to the top of the high plain\r\nabout three miles in advance on the portage. I also had one canoe\r\ncarryed on truck wheles to the same place and put the baggage in it, in\r\norder to make an early start in the morning, as the rout of our portage\r\nis not yet entirely settled, and it would be inconvenient to remain in\r\nthe open plain all night at a distance from water, which would probably\r\nbe the case if we did not set out early as the latter part of the rout\r\nis destitute of water for about 8 miles--having determined to go to the\r\nupper part of the portage tomorrow; in order to prepare my boat and\r\nreceive and take care of the stores as they were transported, I caused\r\nthe Iron frame of the boat and the necessary tools my private baggage\r\nand Instruments to be taken as a part of this load, also the baggage of\r\nJoseph Fields, Sergt. Gass and John sheilds, whom I had scelected to\r\nassist me in constructing the leather boat. Three men were employed\r\ntoday in shaving the Elk skins which had ben collected for the boat.\r\nthe ballance of the party were employed in cuting the meat we had\r\nkilled yesterday into thin Retches and drying it, and in bring in the\r\nballance of what had been left over the river with three men last\r\nevening. I readily preceive several difficulties in preparing the\r\nleather boat which are the want of convenient and proper timber; bark,\r\nskins, and above all that of pitch to pay her seams, a deficiency that\r\nI really know not how to surmount unless it be by means of tallow and\r\npounded charcoal which mixture has answered a very good purpose on our\r\nwooden canoes heretofore. I have seen for the first time on the\r\nMissouri at these falls, a species of fishing ducks with white wings,\r\nbrown and white body and the head and part of the neck adjoining of a\r\nbrick red, and the beak narrow; which I take to be the same common to\r\nJames river, the Potomac and Susquehanna. immence numbers of buffaloe\r\ncomeing to water at the river as usual. the men who remained over the\r\nriver last night killed several mule deer, and Willard who was with me\r\nkilled a young Elk. The wind blew violently all day. The growth of the\r\nneighbourhood what little there is consists of the broad and narrow\r\nleafed cottonwood, box alder, the large or sweet willow, the narrow and\r\nbroad leafed willow. the sweet willow has not been common to the\r\nMissouri below this or the entrance of Maria's river; here attains to\r\nthe same size and in appearance much the same as in the Atlantic\r\nStates. the undergrowth consists of rosebushes, goosberry and current\r\nbushes, honeysuckle small, and the red wood, the inner bark of which\r\nthe engages are fond of smoking mixed with tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 21, 1805]\r\nJune 21st Friday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the S W. off the mountains and hard, Capt\r\nLewis with the men except a few take a part of the baggage & a Canoe up\r\nthe Hill 3 mile in advance, Several men employed in Shaveing & Graneing\r\nElk hides for the Iron boat as it is called--3 men were Sent up the\r\nMedison river yesterday to kill Elk for the Skins for the boat, I fear\r\nthat we Shall be put to Some dificuelty in precureing Elk Skins\r\nSufficent-, Cloudy afternoon, we dry meat for the men to eat on their\r\nreturn from the upper part of the portage Capt Lewis determine to\r\nproceed to the upper part of the Portage tomorrow & with 3 men proced\r\nto fix the Iron boat with Skins &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 22, 1805]\r\nSaturday June 22cd 1805.\r\nThis morning early Capt Clark and myself with all the party except\r\nSergt. Ordway Sharbono, Goodrich, york and the Indian woman, set out to\r\npass the portage with the canoe and baggage to the Whitebear Islands,\r\nwhere we intend that this portage shall end. Capt. Clarke piloted us\r\nthrough the plains. about noon we reached a little stream about 8 miles\r\non the portage where we halted and dined; we were obliged here to renew\r\nboth axeltrees and the tongues and howns of one set of wheels which\r\ntook us no more than 2 hours. these parts of our carriage had been made\r\nof cottonwood and one axetree of an old mast, all of which proved\r\ndeficient and had broken down several times before we reached this\r\nplace we have now renewed them with the sweet willow and hope that they\r\nwill answer better. after dark we had reached within half a mile of our\r\nintended camp when the tongues gave way and we were obliged to leave\r\nthe canoe, each man took as much of the baggage as he could carry on\r\nhis back and proceeded to the river where we formed our encampment much\r\nfortiegued. the prickly pears were extreemly troublesome to us sticking\r\nour feet through our mockersons. Saw a great number of buffaloe in the\r\nplains, also immence quantities of little birds and the large brown\r\ncurloo; the latter is now seting; it lays it's eggs, which are of a\r\npale blue with black specks, on the ground without any preperation of a\r\nnest. there is a kind of larke here that much resembles the bird called\r\nthe oldfield lark with a yellow brest and a black spot on the croop;\r\ntho this differs from ours in the form of the tail which is pointed\r\nbeing formed of feathers of unequal length; the beak is somewhat longer\r\nand more curved and the note differs considerably; however in size,\r\naction, and colours there is no perceptable difference; or at least\r\nnone that strikes my eye. after reaching our camp we kindled our fires\r\nand examined the meat which Capt. Clark had left, but found only a\r\nsmall proportion of it, the wolves had taken the greater part. we eat\r\nour suppers and soon retired to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 22, 1805]\r\nJune 22nd Satturday 1805\r\na fine morning, Capt Lewis my Self and all the party except a Sergeant\r\nOrdway Guterich and the Interpreter and his wife Sar car gah we a (who\r\nare left at Camp to take Care of the baggage left) across the portage\r\nwith one Canoe on truck wheels and loaded with a part of our Baggage I\r\npiloted thro the plains to the Camp I made at which place I intended\r\nthe portage to end which is 3 miles above the Medesin River we had\r\ngreat dificuelty in getting on as the axeltree broke Several times, and\r\nthe Cuppling tongus of the wheels which was of Cotton & willow, the\r\nonly wood except Boxelder & ____ that grow in this quarter, we got\r\nwithin half a mile of our intended Camp much fatigued at dark, our\r\ntongus broke & we took a load to the river on the mens back, where we\r\nfound a number of wolves which had distroyed a great part of our meat\r\nwhich I had left at that place when I was up day before yesterday we\r\nSoon went to Sleep & Slept Sound wind from the ____ we deturmine to\r\nemploy every man Cooks & all on the portage after to day\r\n\r\nCanoe and baggage brought up, after which we breakfasted and nearly\r\nconsumed the meat which he had left here. he now set out on his return\r\nwith the party. I employed the three men with me in the forenoon\r\nclearing away the brush and forming our camp, and puting the frame of\r\nthe boat together. this being done I sent Shields and Gass to look out\r\nfor the necessary timber, and with J. Fields decended the river in the\r\ncanoe to the mouth of Medicine river in surch of the hunters whom I had\r\ndispatched thither on the 19th inst. and from whom we had not heard a\r\nsentence. I entered the mouth of medicine river and ascended it about\r\nhalf a mile when we landed and walked up the Stard. side. frequently\r\nhooping as we went on in order to find the hunters; at length after\r\nascending the river about five miles we found Shannon who had passed\r\nthe Medecine river & fixed his camp on the Lard. side, where he had\r\nkilled seven deer and several buffaloe and dryed about 600 lbs. of\r\nbuffaloe meat; but had killed no Elk. Shannon could give me no further\r\naccount of R. Fields and Drewyer than that he had left them about noon\r\non the 19th at the great falls and had come on the mouth of Medicine\r\nriver to hunt Elk as he had been directed, and never had seen them\r\nsince. the evening being now far spent I thought it better to pass the\r\nMedicine river and remain all night at Shannon's camp; I passed the\r\nriver on a raft which we soon constructed for the purpose. the river is\r\nhere about 80 yds. wide, is deep and but a moderate current. the banks\r\nlow as those of the Missouri above the falls yet never appear to\r\noverflow. as it will give a better view of the transactions of the\r\nparty, I shall on each day give the occurrences of both camps during\r\nour seperation as I afterwards learnt those of the lower camp from\r\nCapt. Clark. on his return today he cut of several angles of the rout\r\nby which we came yesterday, shortened the portage considerably,\r\nmeasured it and set up stakes throughout as guides to marke the rout.\r\nhe returned this evening to the lower camp in sufficient time to take\r\nup two of the canoes from portage creek to the top of the plain about a\r\nmile in advance. this evening the men repaired their mockersons, and\r\nput on double souls to protect their feet from the prickley pears.\r\nduring the late rains the buffaloe have troden up the praire very much,\r\nwhich having now become dry the sharp points of earth as hard as frozen\r\nground stand up in such abundance that there is no avoiding them. this\r\nis particulary severe on the feet of the men who have not only their\r\nown wight to bear in treading on those hacklelike points but have also\r\nthe addition of the burthen which they draw and which in fact is as\r\nmuch as they can possibly move with. they are obliged to halt and rest\r\nfrequently for a few minutes, at every halt these poor fellows tumble\r\ndown and are so much fortiegued that many of them are asleep in an\r\ninstant; in short their fatiegues are incredible; some are limping from\r\nthe soreness of their feet, others faint and unable to stand for a few\r\nminutes, with heat and fatiegue, yet no one complains, all go with\r\ncheerfullness. in evening Reubin Fields returned to the lower camp and\r\ninformed Capt. Clark of the absence of Shannon, with rispect to whome\r\nthey were extreemly uneasy. Fields and Drewyer had killed several\r\nbuffaloe at the bend of the missouri above the falls and had dryed a\r\nconsiderable quantity of meat; they had also killed several deer but no\r\nElk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 23, 1805]\r\nJune 23rd Sunday 1805\r\na Cloudy morning wind from the S.

I had the best rout Staked out and\r\nmeasured which is 17 miles 3/4 to the river & 1/2 a mile up i.e 181/4\r\nmiles portage--from the lower rapid to the 1st Creek is 286 poles, to a\r\nDeep run of water, Called Willow Run is 6 miles thence to the river 3\r\nmiles above Medison Riv at 3 Island Called White Bear Islands is 11\r\nmiles all prarie without wood or water except at the Creek & run which\r\nafford a plenty of fine water and a little wood the plain is tolerably\r\nleavel except at the river a Small assent & passing a low hill from the\r\nCreek a rough & Steep assent for about 1/4 of a mile and Several\r\nGullies & a gradual hill for 11/2 miles the heads of Several gullies\r\nwhich have Short assents & the willow run of a Steep hill on this run\r\ngrows Purple & red Currents. the red is now ripe the Purple full grown,\r\nan emence number of Prarie birds now Setting of two kinds one larger\r\nthan a Sparrow dark yellow the Center feathers of its tail yellow & the\r\nout Sides black Some Streeks about its neck, the other about the Same\r\nSize White tail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 24, 1805]\r\nMonday June 24th 1805.\r\nSupposing that Drewyer and R. Fields might possibly be still higher up\r\nmedicine river, I dispatched J. Fields up the river with orders to\r\nproceede about four miles and then return whether he found them or not\r\nand join Shannon at this camp. I set out early and walked down the\r\nSouth West side of the river and sent Shannon down the opposite side to\r\nbring the canoe over to me and put me across the Missouri; having\r\nlanded on the Lard. side of the Missouri I sent Shannon back with the\r\ncanoe to ascend the Medicine river as far as his camp to meet J. Fields\r\nand bring the dryed meat at that place to the camp at the white bear\r\nIslands which accomplished and arrived with Fields this evening. the\r\nparty also arrived this evening with two canoes from the lower camp.\r\nthey were wet and fatiegued, gave them a dram. R. Fields came with them\r\nand gave me an account of his & Drewyer's hunt, and informed me that\r\nDrewyer was still at their camp with the meat they had dryed. the iron\r\nframe of my boat is 36 feet long 41/2 F. in the beam and 26 Inches in\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nThis morning early Capt. Clark had the remaining canoe drawn out of the\r\nwater; and divided the remainder of our baggage into three parcels, one\r\nof which he sent today by the party with two canoes. The Indian woman\r\nis now perfectly recovered. Capt. C. came a few miles this morning to\r\nsee the party under way and returned. on my arrival at the upper camp\r\nthis morning, I found that Sergt. Gass and Shields had made but slow\r\nprogress in collecting timber for the boat; they complained of great\r\ndifficulty in geting streight or even tolerably streight sticks of 4/2\r\nfeet long. we were obliged to make use of the willow and box alder, the\r\ncottonwood being too soft and brittle. I kept one of them collecting\r\ntimber while the other shaved and fitted them. I have found some pine\r\nlogs among the drift wood near this place, from which, I hope to obtain\r\nas much pitch as will answer to pay the seams of the boat. I directed\r\nFraizer to remain in order to sew the hides together, and form the\r\ncovering for the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 24, 1805]\r\nJune 24th Monday 1805\r\na Cloudy morning I rose early had, the remaining Canoe hauled out of\r\nthe water to dry and divided the baggage into 3 parcels, one of which\r\nthe party took on their backs & one waggon with truk wheels to the\r\nCanoes 3 miles in advance (Those Canoes or 5 of our Canoes were Carried\r\nup the Creek 13/4 of a mile taken out on the bank and left to dry from\r\nwhich place they are taken up a point and intersects this rout from the\r\nmouth of the Creek at 3 miles from the foot of the rapids) after\r\ngetting up their loads they divided men & load & proceeded on with 2\r\ncanoes on truck wheels as before, I accompaned them 4 miles and\r\nreturned, my feet being verry Sore from the walk over ruts Stones &\r\nhills & thro the leavel plain for 6 days proceeding Carrying my pack\r\nand gun. Some few drops of rain in the fore part of the day, at 6\r\noClock a black Cloud arose to the N West, the wind shifted from the S\r\nto that point and in a short time the earth was entirely Covered with\r\nhail, Some rain Succeeded, which Continud for about an hour very\r\nmoderately on this Side of the river, without the earths being wet 1/2\r\nan inch, the riveins on the opposit or N W Side discharged emence\r\ntorrents of water into the river, & Showed evidently that the rain was\r\nmuch heavyer on that Side, Some rain at different times in the night\r\nwhich was worm--Thunder without lightning accompanied the hail Cloud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 25, 1805]\r\nTuesday June 25th 1805.\r\nThis morning early I sent the party back to the lower camp; dispatched\r\nFrazier down with the canoe for Drewyer and the meat he had collected,\r\nand Joseph Fields up the Missouri to hunt Elk. at eight OCIk. sent Gass\r\nand Sheilds over to the large Island for bark and timber. about noon\r\nFields returned and informed me that he had seen two white bear near\r\nthe river a few miles above and in attempting to get a shoot them had\r\nstumbled uppon a third which immediately made at him being only a few\r\nsteps distant; that in runing in order to escape from the bear he had\r\nleaped down a steep bank of the river on a stony bar where he fell cut\r\nhis hand bruised his knees and bent his gun. that fortunately for him\r\nthe bank hid him from the bear when he fell and that by that means he\r\nhad escaped. this man has been truly unfortunate with these bear, this\r\nis the second time that he has narrowly escaped from them. about 2 P. M\r\nShields and Gass returned with but a small quantity of both bark and\r\ntimber and informed me that it was all they could find on the Island;\r\nthey had killed two Elk the skins of which and a part of the flesh they\r\nbrought with them. in the evening Drewyer and Frazier arrivd with about\r\n800 lbs. of excellent dryed meat and about 100 lbs of tallow. The river\r\nis about 800 yds. wide opposite to us above these islands, and has a\r\nvery gentle current the bottoms are hadsome level and extensive on both\r\nsides; the bank on this side is not more than 2 feet above the level of\r\nthe water; it is a pretty little grove in which our camp is situated.\r\nthere is a species of wild rye which is now heading it rises to the\r\nhight of 18 or 20 inches, the beard is remarkably fine and soft it is a\r\nvery handsome grass the culm is jointed and is in every rispect the\r\nwild rye in minuture. great quantities of mint also are here it\r\nresemble the pepper mint very much in taste and appearance. the young\r\nblackbirds which are almost innumerable in these islands just begin to\r\nfly. see a number of water tarripens. I have made an unsuccessfull\r\nattempt to catch fish, and do not think there are any in this part of\r\nthe river. The party that returned this evening to the lower camp\r\nreached it in time to take one canoe on the plain and prepare their\r\nbaggage for an early start in the morning after which such as were able\r\nto shake a foot amused themselves in dancing on the green to the music\r\nof the violin which Cruzatte plays extreemly well.\r\n\r\nCapt.

This morning early I\r\ndispatched J. Fields and Drewyer in one of the canoes up the river to\r\nhunt Elk. set Frazier at work to sew the skins together for the\r\ncovering of the boat. Sheilds and Gas I sent over the river to lurch a\r\nsmall timbered bottom on that side opposite to the Islands for timber\r\nand bark; and to myself I assign the duty of cook as well for those\r\npresent as for the party which I expect again to arrive this evening\r\nfrom the lower camp. I collected my wood and water, boiled a large\r\nquantity of excellent dryed buffaloe meat and made each man a large\r\nsuet dumpling by way of a treat. about 4 P.M. Shields and Gass returned\r\nwith a better supply of timber than they had yet collected tho not by\r\nany means enough. they brought some bark principally of the Cottonwood\r\nwhich I found was too brittle and soft for the purpose; for this\r\narticle I find my only dependence is the sweet willow which has a tough\r\n& strong bark. Shields and Gass had killed seven buffaloe in their\r\nabsence the skins of which and a part of the best of the meat they\r\nbrought with them. if I cannot procure a sufficient quantity of Elk's\r\nskins I shall substitute those of the buffaloe. late in the evening the\r\nparty arrived with two more canoes and another portion of the baggage.\r\nWhitehouse one of them much heated and fortiegued on his arrivall dank\r\na very hearty draught of water and was taken almost instanly extreemly\r\nill. his pulse were very full and I therefore bled him plentifully from\r\nwhich he felt great relief. I had no other instrument with which to\r\nperform this opperation but my pen knife, however it answered very\r\nwell. the wind being from S. E today and favourable the men made\r\nconsiderable progress by means of their sails.\r\n\r\nAt the lower Camp. The party set out very early from this place, and\r\ntook with them two canoes and a second alotment of baggage consisting\r\nof Parched meal, Pork, powder lead axes, tools, bisquit, portable\r\nsoupe, some merchandize and cloathing. Capt. C. gave Sergt. Pryor a\r\ndoze of salts this morning and employed Sharbono in rendering the\r\nbuffaloe tallow which had been collected there, he obtained a\r\nsufficient quantity to fill three empty kegs. Capt. C. also scelected\r\nthe articles to be deposited in the cash consisting of my desk which I\r\nhad left for that purpose and in which I had left some books, my\r\nspecimens of plants minerals &c. collected from fort Mandan to that\r\nplace. also 2 Kegs of Pork, 1/2 a Keg of flour 2 blunderbushes, 1/2 a\r\nkeg of fixed ammunition and some other small articles belonging to the\r\nparty which could be dispenced with. deposited the swivel and carriage\r\nunder the rocks a little above the camp near the river. great numbers\r\nof buffaloe still continue to water daily opposite the camp. The\r\nantelopes still continue scattered and seperate in the plains. the\r\nfemales with their young only of which they generally have two, and the\r\nmales alone. Capt. Clarke measured the rout from the Camp at the\r\nWhitebear Islands to the lower camp which is as follows.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 26, 1805]\r\nJune 26th Wednesday 1805\r\nSome rain last night this morning verry Cloudy the party Set out this\r\nmorning verry early with their loads to the Canoe Consisting of Parched\r\nmeal Pork Powder Lead axes, Tools Bisquit, P.

W. and shortly\r\nafter came on attended with violent Thunder Lightning and hail &c. (see\r\nnotes on diary of the weather for June). soon after this storm was over\r\nDrewyer and J. Fields returned. they were about 4 miles above us during\r\nthe storm, the hail was of no uncommon size where they were. They had\r\nkilled 9 Elk and three bear during their absence; one of the bear was\r\nthe largest by far that we have yet seen; the skin appear to me to be\r\nas large as a common ox. while hunting they saw a thick brushey bottom\r\non the bank of the river where from the tracks along shore they\r\nsuspected that there were bare concealed; they therefore landed without\r\nmaking any nois and climbed a leaning tree and placed themselves on\r\nit's branches about 20 feet above the ground, when thus securely fixed\r\nthey gave a hoop and this large bear instantly rushed forward to the\r\nplace from whence he had heard the human voice issue, when he arrived\r\nat the tree he made a short paus and Drewyer shot him in the head. it\r\nis worthy of remark that these bear never climb. the fore feet of this\r\nbear measured nine inches across and the hind feet eleven and--3/4 in\r\nlength & exclusive of the tallons and seven inches in width. a bear\r\ncame within thirty yards of our camp last night and eat up about thirty\r\nweight of buffaloe suit which was hanging on a pole. my dog seems to be\r\nin a constant state of alarm with these bear and keeps barking all\r\nnight. soon after the storm this evening the water on this side of the\r\nriver became of a deep crimson colour which I pesume proceeded from\r\nsome stream above and on this side. there is a kind of soft red stone\r\nin the bluffs and bottoms. of the gullies in this neighbourhood which\r\nforms this colouring matter.--At the lower camp. Capt. Clark completed\r\na draught of the river with the couses and distances from the entrance\r\nof the Missouri to Ft. Mandan, which we intend depositing here in order\r\nto guard against accedents. Sergt. Pryor is somewhat better this\r\nmorning. at 4 P.M. the party returned from the upper camp; Capt. C.\r\ngave them a drink of grog; they prepared for the labour of the next\r\nday. soon after the party returned it began to rain accompanyed by some\r\nhail and continued a short time; a second shower fell late in the\r\nevening accompanyed by a high wind from N. W.--the mangled carcases of\r\nseveral buffaloe pass down the river today which had no doubt perished\r\nin the falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 27, 1805]\r\nJune 27th Thursday 1805\r\na fair warm morning wind from the S, E, and moderate.

The White bear have become so troublesome to us that I\r\ndo not think it prudent to send one man alone on an errand of any kind,\r\nparticularly where he has to pass through the brush. we have seen two\r\nof them on the large Island opposite to us today but are so much\r\nengaged that we could not spare the time to hunt them but will make a\r\nfrolick of it when the party return and drive them from these islands.\r\nthey come close arround our camp every night but have never yet\r\nventured to attack us and our dog gives us timely notice of their\r\nvisits, he keeps constantly padroling all night. I have made the men\r\nsleep with their arms by them as usual for fear of accedents. the river\r\nis now about nine inches higher than it was on my arrival. lower Camp.\r\nearly this morning Capt. C. dispatched the remaining canoe with some\r\nbaggage to the top of the plain above Portage creek three miles in\r\nadvance; some others he employed in carrying the articles to the cash\r\nand depositing them and others to mend the carriages which wer somewhat\r\nout of repair. this being accomplished he loaded the two carriages with\r\nthe remaining baggage and set out with all the party and proceeded on\r\nwith much difficulty to the canoe in the plain. portage creek had\r\narisen considerably and the water was of crimson colour and illy\r\ntasted. on his arrival at the canoe he found there was more baggage\r\nthan he could possibly take at one load on the two sets of trucks and\r\ntherefore left some barrels of pork & flour and a few heavy boxes of\r\namunition which could not well be injured, and proceeded with the canoe\r\n& one set of trucks loaded with baggage to willow run where he encamped\r\nfor the night, and killed two buffaloe to subsist the party. soon after\r\nhis arrival at willow run he experienced a hard shower of rain which\r\nwas succeeded by a violent wind from the S. W. off the snowy mountains,\r\naccompanyed with rain; the party being cold and wet, he administered\r\nthe consolation of a dram to each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 28, 1805]\r\nJune 28th Friday 1805\r\na fair morning wind from the South I dispatch the remaining Canoe with\r\nbaggage in her to the top of the Hill three miles, imploy Some hands in\r\nCarrying those things we intend to deposit to the Carsh or hole, Some\r\nto repareing one of the trucks &c. &c. the water is riseing and of a\r\nredish brown Cholour after Covering the Carshe & loading the two\r\nCarrges with the remaining part of our Baggage we all Set out passed\r\nthe Creek which had rose a little and the water nearly red, and bad\r\ntasted, we assended the hill to the place the Canoe lay with great\r\nlabour, at the Canoe at which place we left Some boxes & Kegs of Pork &\r\nflour for another Load, and proceeded on with the Canoe & what baggage\r\nwe could draw on the wheels to willow run 6 miles where we Camped, this\r\nrun mearly Some water remaining in holes &c. Soon after we halted we\r\nhad a Shower, and at dark we expereinced a most dredfull wind from off\r\nthe Snow Mountains to the S. W. accompd. with rain which continued at\r\nintervales all night men wet. I refreshed them with a dram. Killed 2\r\nBuffalow. Great nos. about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 29, 1805]\r\nSaturday June 29th 1805.\r\nThis morning we experienced a heavy shower of rain for about an hour\r\nafter which it became fair. not having seen the large fountain of which\r\nCapt. Clark spoke I determined to visit it today as I could better\r\nspare this day from my attention to the boat than probably any other\r\nwhen the work would be further advanced; accordingly after seting the\r\nhands at their several employments I took Drewyer and seet out for the\r\nfountain and passed through a level beautiful plain for about Six miles\r\nwhen I reached the brake of the river hills here we were overtaken by a\r\nviolent gust of wind and rain from the S. W. attended with thunder and\r\nLitning. I expected a hail storm probably from this cloud and therefore\r\ntook refuge in a little gully wher there were some broad stones with\r\nwhich I purposed protecting my head if we should have a repetition of\r\nthe seene of the 27th but fortunately we had but little hail and that\r\nnot large; I sat very composedly for about an hour without sheter and\r\ntook a copious drenching of rain; after the shower was over I continued\r\nmy rout to the fountain which I found much as Capt. C; had discribed &\r\nthink it may well be retained on the list of prodegies of this\r\nneighbourhood towards which, nature seems to have dealt with a liberal\r\nhand, for I have scarcely experienced a day since my first arrival in\r\nthis quarter without experiencing some novel occurrence among the party\r\nor witnessing the appearance of some uncommon object. I think this\r\nfountain the largest I ever beheld, and the hadsome cascade which it\r\naffords over some steep and irregular rocks in it's passage to the\r\nriver adds not a little to it's beauty. it is about 25 yds. from the\r\nriver, situated in a pretty little level plain, and has a suddon decent\r\nof about 6 feet in one part of it's course. the water of this fountain\r\nis extreemly tranparent and cold; nor is it impregnated with lime or\r\nany other extranious matter which I can discover, but is very pure and\r\npleasent. it's waters marke their passage as Capt. Clark observes for a\r\nconsiderable distance down the Missouri notwithstanding it's rapidity\r\nand force. the water of the fountain boil up with such force near it's\r\ncenter that it's surface in that part seems even higher than the\r\nsurrounding earth which is a firm handsom terf of fine green grass.\r\nafter amusing myself about 20 minutes in examining the fountain I found\r\nmyself so chilled with my wet cloaths that I determined to return and\r\naccordingly set out; on our way to camp we found a buffaloe dead which\r\nwe had shot as we came out and took a parsel of the meat to camp it was\r\nin very good order; the hump and tongue of a fat buffaloe I esteem\r\ngreat delicasies. on my arrival at camp I was astonished not to find\r\nthe party yet arrived, but then concluded that probably the state of\r\nthe praries had detained them, as in the wet state in which they are at\r\npresent the mud sticks to the wheels is such manner that they are\r\nobliged to halt frequently and clense them. Transaction and\r\noccurrencies which took place with Capt. Clark and party today.\r\n\r\nShortly after the rain which fell early this morning he found it\r\nimposseble from the state of the plains for the party to reach the\r\nupper extremity of the portage with their present load, and therefore\r\nsent back almost all of the party to bring the baggage which had been\r\nleft behind yesterday. he determined himself to pass by the way of the\r\nriver to camp in order to supply the deficiency of some notes and\r\nremarks which he had made as he first ascended the river but which he\r\nhad unfortunately lost. accordingly he left one man at Willow run to\r\nguard the baggage and took with him his black man York, Sharbono and\r\nhis indian woman also accompanyed Capt. C. on his arrival at the falls\r\nhe perceived a very black cloud rising in the West which threatened\r\nimmediate rain; he looked about for a shelter but could find none\r\nwithout being in great danger of being blown into the river should the\r\nwind prove as violent as it sometimes is on those occasions in these\r\nplains; at length about a 1/4 of a mile above the falls he discovered a\r\ndeep rivene where there were some shelving rocks under which he took\r\nshelter near the river with Sharbono and the Indian woman; laying their\r\nguns compass &c. under a shelving rock on the upper side of the rivene\r\nwhere they were perfectly secure from the rain. the first shower was\r\nmoderate accompanyed by a violent rain the effects of which they did\r\nbut little feel; soon after a most violent torrent of rain decended\r\naccompanyed with hail; the rain appeared to decend in a body and\r\ninstantly collected in the rivene and came down in a roling torrent\r\nwith irrisistable force driving rocks mud and everything before it\r\nwhich opposed it's passage, Capt. C. fortunately discovered it a moment\r\nbefore it reached them and seizing his gun and shot pouch with his left\r\nhand with the right he assisted himself up the steep bluff shoving\r\noccasionaly the Indian woman before him who had her child in her arms;\r\nSharbono had the woman by the hand indeavouring to pull her up the hill\r\nbut was so much frightened that he remained frequently motionless and\r\nbut for Capt. C. both himself and his woman and child must have\r\nperished. so suddon was the rise of the water that before Capt C could\r\nreach his gun and begin to ascend the bank it was up to his waist and\r\nwet his watch; and he could scarcely ascend faster than it arrose till\r\nit had obtained the debth of 15 feet with a current tremendious to\r\nbehold. one moment longer & it would have swept them into the river\r\njust above the great cataract of 87 feet where they must have\r\ninevitably perished. Sarbono lost his gun shot pouch, horn, tomahawk,\r\nand my wiping rod; Capt. Clark his Umbrella and compas or\r\ncircumferenter. they fortunately arrived on the plain safe, where they\r\nfound the black man, York, in surch of them; york had seperated from\r\nthem a little while before the storm, in pursuit of some buffaloe and\r\nhad not seen them enter the rivene; when this gust came on he returned\r\nin surch of them & not being able to find them for some time was much\r\nallarmed. the bier in which the woman carrys her child and all it's\r\ncloaths wer swept away as they lay at her feet she having time only to\r\ngrasp her child; the infant was therefore very cold and the woman also\r\nwho had just recovered from a severe indisposition was also wet and\r\ncold, Capt C. therefore relinquished his intended rout and returned to\r\nthe camp at willow run in order also to obtain dry cloathes for himself\r\nand directed them to follow him. on Capt. Clark's arrival at camp he\r\nfound that the party dispatched for the baggage had returned in great\r\nconfusion and consternation leaving their loads in the plains; the men\r\nwho were all nearly naked and no covering on the head were sorely\r\nmawled with the hail which was so large and driven with such force by\r\nthe wind that it nocked many of them (town and one particulary as many\r\nas three times most of them were bleeding freely and complained of\r\nbeing much bruised. willow run raised about 6 feet with this rain and\r\nthe plains were so wet they could do nothing more this evening. Capt.\r\nC. gave the party a dram to console them in some measure for their\r\ngeneral defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 29, 1805]\r\nJunne 29th Saltarday 1805\r\na little rain verry early this morning after Clear, finding that the\r\nPrarie was So wet as to render it impossible to pass on to the end of\r\nthe portage, deturmined to Send hack to the top of the hill at the\r\nCreek for the remaining part of the baggage left at that place\r\nyesterday, leaveing one man to take care of the baggage at this place.\r\nI deturmined any Self to proceed on to the falls and take the river,\r\naccording we all Set out., I took my Servent & one man Chabono our\r\nInterpreter & his Squar accompanied, Soon after I arrived at the falls,\r\nI perceived a Cloud which appeared black and threaten imediate rain, I\r\nlooked out for a Shelter but Could See no place without being in great\r\ndanger of being blown into the river if the wind Should prove as\r\nturbelant as it is at Some times about 1/4 of a mile above the falls I\r\nobsd a Deep rivein in which was Shelveing rocks under which we took\r\nShelter near the river and placed our guns the Compass &c. &c. Under a\r\nShelveing rock on the upper Side of the Creek, in a place which was\r\nverry Secure from rain, the first Shower was moderate accompanied with\r\na violent wind, the effects of which we did not feel, Soon after a\r\ntorrent of rain and hail fell more violent than ever I Saw before, the\r\nrain fell like one voley of water falling from the heavens and gave us\r\ntime only to get out of the way of a torrent of water which was Poreing\r\ndown the hill in the rivin with emence force tareing every thing before\r\nit takeing with it large rocks & mud, I took my gun & Shot pouch in my\r\nleft hand, and with the right Scrambled up the hill pushing the\r\nInterpreters wife (who had her Child in her arms) before me, the\r\nInterpreter himself makeing attempts to pull up his wife by the hand\r\nmuch Scared and nearly without motion--we at length retched the top of\r\nthe hill Safe where I found my Servent in Serch of us greatly agitated,\r\nfor our wellfar-. before I got out of the bottom of the revein which\r\nwas a flat dry rock when I entered it, the water was up to my waste &\r\nwet my watch, I Scrcely got out before it raised 10 feet deep with a\r\ntorrent which turrouble to behold, and by the time I reached the top of\r\nthe hill, at least 15 feet water, I directed the party to return to the\r\nCamp at the run as fast as possible to get to our lode where Clothes\r\nCould be got to Cover the Child whose Clothes were all lost, and the\r\nwoman who was but just recovering from a Severe indispostion, and was\r\nwet and Cold, I was fearfull of a relaps I caused her as also the\r\nothers of the party to take a little Spirits, which my Servent had in a\r\nCanteen, which revived verry much. on arrival at the Camp on the willow\r\nrun-met the party who had returned in great Confusion to the run\r\nleaveing their loads in the Plain, the hail & wind being So large and\r\nviolent in the plains, and them naked, they were much brused, and Some\r\nnearly killed one knocked down three times, and others without hats or\r\nany thing on their heads bloodey & Complained verry much; I refreshed\r\nthem with a little grog--Soon after the run began to rise and rose 6\r\nfeet in a few minits-. I lost at the river in the torrent the large\r\nCompas, an eligant fusee, Tomahawk Humbrallo, Shot pouh, & horn wih\r\npowder & Ball, mockersons, & the woman lost her Childs Bear & Clothes\r\nbedding &c.--The Compass is a Serious loss; as we have no other large\r\none.

Fraizer\r\nand Whitehouse still continue their opperation of sewing the skins\r\ntogether. I set Shields and gass to shaving bark and Fields continued\r\nto make the cross brases. Drewyer and myself rendered a considerable\r\nquantity of tallow and cooked. I begin to be extremely impatient to be\r\noff as the season is now waisting a pace nearly three months have now\r\nelapsed since we left Fort Mandan and not yet reached the Rocky\r\nMountains I am therefore fully preswaded that we shall not reach Fort\r\nMandan again this season if we even return from the ocean to the Snake\r\nIndians. wherever we find timber there is also beaver; Drewyer killed\r\ntwo today. There are a number of large bat or goatsucker here I killed\r\none of them and found that there was no difference between them and\r\nthose common to the U States; I have not seen the leather winged bat\r\nfor some time nor is there any of the small goatsuckers in this quarter\r\nof the country. we have not the whip-poor-will either. this last is by\r\nmany persons in the U States confounded with the large goat-sucker or\r\nnight-hawk as it is called in the Eastern States, and are taken for the\r\nsame bird. it is true that there is a great resemblance but they are\r\ndistinct species of the goatsucker. here the one exists without the\r\nother. the large goat sucker lays it's eggs in these open plains\r\nwithout the preperation of a nest we have found their eggs in several\r\ninstances they lay only two before they set nor do I beleive that they\r\nraise more than one brood in a season; they have now just hatched their\r\nyoung.--This evening the bark was shaved and the leather covering for\r\nthe sections were also completed and I had them put into the water, in\r\norder to toughen the bark, and prepare the leather for sewing on the\r\nsections in the morning. it has taken 28 Elk skins and 4 Buffaloe skins\r\nto complete her. the crossbars are also finished this evening; we have\r\ntherefore only the way strips now to obtain in order to complete the\r\nwood work, and this I fear will be a difficult task. The party have not\r\nreturned from the lower camp I am therefore fearfull that some uncommon\r\naccedent has happened.\r\n\r\nOccurrences with Capt. Clark and Party\r\n\r\nThis morning Capt. Clark dispatched two men to kill some buffaloe, two\r\nothers to the falls to surch for the articles lost yesterday, one he\r\nretained to cook and sent the others for the baggage left in the plains\r\nyesterday. the hunters soon returned loaded with meat those sent for\r\nthe baggage brought it up in a few hours, he then set four men at work\r\nto make axeltrees and repare the carrages; the others he employed in\r\nconveying the baggage over the run on their sholders it having now\r\nfallent to about 3 feet water. the men complained much today of the\r\nbruises and wounds which they had received yesterday from the hail. the\r\ntwo men sent to the falls returned with the compas which they found\r\ncovered in the mud and sand near the mouth of the rivene the other\r\narticles were irrecoverably lost. they found that part of rivene in;\r\nwhich Capt. C. had been seting yesterday, filled with huge rocks. at 11\r\nA.M. Capt. Clark dispatched the party with a load of the baggage as far\r\nas the 6 miles stake, with orders to deposit it there and return with\r\nthe carriages which they did accordingly. they experienced a heavy gust\r\nof wind this evening from the S. W. after which it was a fair\r\nafternoon. more buffaloe than usual were seen about their camp; Capt. C\r\nassured me that he beleives he saw at least ten thousand at one view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 30, 1805]\r\nJune 30th Sunday 1805.\r\na fair morning, I dispatch the party except 5 for the remaining baggage\r\nScattered in the plains, two to hunt for meat, two to the falls, and\r\none to Cook at 10 oClock the hunters Came in loaded with fat meat, &\r\nthose were dispatched for the baggage returned with it.

Great numbers\r\nof Buffalow in every direction, I think 10,000 may be Seen in a view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 1, 1805]\r\nMonday July 1st 1805.\r\nThis morning I set Frazier and Whitehouse to sewing the leather on the\r\nsides of the sections of the boat; Shields and J. Fields to collect and\r\nsplit light wood and prepare a pit to make tar. Gas I set at work to\r\nmake the way strips out of some willow limbs which tho indifferent were\r\nthe best which could be obtained. Drewyer and myself completed the\r\nopperation of rendering the tallow; we obtained about 100 lbs. by\r\nevening the skins were all attatched to their sections and I returned\r\nthem again to the water. all matters were now in readiness to commence\r\nthe opperation of puting the parts of the boat together in the morning.\r\nthe way strips are not yet ready but will be done in time as I have\r\nobtained the necessary timber. the difficulty in obtaining the\r\nnecessary materials has retarded my operations in forming this boat\r\nextreemly tedious and troublesome; and as it was a novel peice of\r\nmachinism to all who were employed my constant attention was necessary\r\nto every part of the work; this together with the duties of cheif cook\r\nhas kept me pretty well employed. at 3 P.M. Capt. Clark arrived with\r\nthe party all very much fortiegued. he brought with him all the baggage\r\nexcept what he had deposited yesterday at the six mile stake, for which\r\nthe party were too much fortiegued to return this evening. we gave them\r\na dram and suffered them to rest from their labours this evening. I\r\ndirected Bratton to assist in making the tar tomorrow, and scelected\r\nseveral others to assist in puting the boat together. the day has been\r\nwarm and the Musquetoes troublesome of course the bear were about our\r\ncamp all last night, we have therefore determined to beat up their\r\nquarters tomorrow, and kill them or drive them from their haunts about\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 1, 1805]\r\nWhite Bear Islands above the Falls of the Missouri July 1st Monday 1805\r\nI arrived at this place to day at 3 oClock P.M. with the party from the\r\nlower part of the portage much fatigued &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 1, 1805]\r\nJuly 1st Monday 1805.\r\nWe Set out early this morning with the remaining load, and proceeded on\r\nverry well to Capt Lewis's Camp where we arrived at 3 oClock, the Day\r\nworm and party much fatigued, found Capt.

Shields and\r\nBratton seting their tarkiln, Sergts. Pryor and Gass at work on the\r\nwaystrips and myself and all other hands engaged in puting the boat\r\ntogether which we accomplished in about 3 hours and I then set four men\r\nat work sewing the leather over the cross bars of Iron on the inner\r\nside of the boat, which form the ends of the sections. about 2 P.M. the\r\nparty returned with the baggage, all well pleased that they had\r\ncompleted the laborious task of the portage. The Musquetoes uncommonly\r\ntroublesome the wind hard from the S. W. all day I think it possible\r\nthat these almost perpetual S. W. winds proceede from the agency of the\r\nSnowey Mountains and the wide level and untimbered plains which streach\r\nthemselves along their bases for an immence distance (i e) that the air\r\ncomeing in contact with the snow is suddonly chilled and condenced,\r\nthus becoming heaver than the air beneath in the plains, it glides down\r\nthe sides of these mountains & decends to the plains, where by the\r\nconstant action of the sun on the face of an untimbered country there\r\nis a partial vacuum formed for it's reception. I have observed that the\r\nwinds from this quarter are always the coldest and most violent which\r\nwe experience, yet I am far from giving full credit to my own\r\nhypothesis on this subject; if hoever I find on the opposite side of\r\nthese mountains that the winds take a contrary direction I shall then\r\nhave more faith. After I had completed my observation of Equal\r\nAltitudes today Capt. Clark Myself and 12 men passed over to the large\r\nIsland to hunt bear. the brush in that part of it where the bear\r\nfrequent is an almost impenetrable thicket of the broad leafed willow;\r\nthis brush we entered in small parties of 3 or four together and\r\nsurched in every part. we found one only which made at Drewyer and he\r\nshot him in the brest at the distance of about 20 feet, the ball\r\nfortunately passed through his heart, the stroke knocked the bear down\r\nand gave Drewyer time to get out of his sight; the bear changed his\r\ncourse we pursued him about a hundred yards by the blood and found him\r\ndead; we surched the thicket in every part but found no other, and\r\ntherefore returned. this was a young male and would weigh about 400\r\nlbs. the water of the Missouri here is in most places about 10 feet\r\ndeep. after our return, in moving some of the baggage we caught a large\r\nrata it was somewhat larger than the common European rat, of lighter\r\ncolour; the body and outer part of the legs and head of a light lead\r\ncolour, the belly and inner side of the legs white as were also the\r\nfeet and years. the toes were longer and the ears much larger than the\r\ncommon rat; the ears uncovered with hair. the eyes were black and\r\nprominent the whiskers very long and full. the tail was reather longer\r\nthan the body and covered with fine fur or poil of the same length and\r\ncolour of the back. the fur was very silkey close and short. I have\r\nfrequently seen the nests of these rats in clifts of rocks and hollow\r\ntrees but never before saw one of them. they feed very much on the\r\nfruit and seed of the prickly pear; or at least I have seen large\r\nquantities of the hulls of that fruit lying about their holes and in\r\ntheir nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 2, 1805]\r\nJuly 2nd Tuesday 1805\r\nSome rain at day light this morning. dispatched the party for the\r\nremaining baggage left at the 6 mile Stake, they returned in the\r\nevening and we Crossed to a large Island nearly opposit to us to kill\r\nbear which has been Seen frequently in the Island, we killed one bear &\r\nreturned at Sun Set.

I fear I have committed another blunder\r\nalso in sewing the skins with a nedle which has sharp edges these have\r\ncut the skin and as it drys I discover that the throng dose not fill\r\nthe holes as I expected tho I made them sew with a large throng for\r\nthat purpose. at 10 OCk A.M. we had a slight shower which scarcely wet\r\nthe grass. One buffaloe only and 2 Antelopes killed today six beaver\r\nand 2 otter have been killed within the last three days. The current of\r\nthe river looks so gentle and inviting that the men all seem anxious to\r\nbe moving upward as well as ourselves. we have got the boat prety well\r\nforward today and think we shall be able to complete her tomorrow\r\nexcept paying her, to do which will require some little time to make\r\nher first perfectly dry. she has assumed her shape and looks extreemly\r\nwell.

W. I think it\r\npossible that those almost perpetial S W. winds, proceed from the\r\nagency of the Snowey mountains and the wide leavel and untimbered\r\nplains which Streach themselves along their borders for an emence\r\ndistance, that the air comeing in Contact with the Snow is Suddenly\r\nchilled and condensed, thus becomeing heavyer than the air beneath in\r\nthe plains it glides down the Sides of those mountains and decends to\r\nthe plains, where by the constant action of the Sun on the face of the\r\nuntimbered country there is a partial vacuom formed for it's reception\r\nI have observed that the winds from this quarter is always the Coaldest\r\nand most violent which we experience, yet I am far from giveing full\r\ncredit to this hypothesis on this Subject; if I find however on the\r\nopposit Side of these mountains that the winds take a contrary\r\ndirection I Shall then have full faith. (The winds take a contrary\r\ndirection in the morning or from the mountains on the west Side)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 4, 1805]\r\nThursday July 4th 1805.\r\nYesterday we permitted Sergt. Gass McNeal and several others who had\r\nnot yet seen the falls to visit them. no appearance of tar yet and I am\r\nnow confident that we shall not be able to obtain any; a serious\r\nmisfortune. I employed a number of hands on the boat today and by 4\r\nP.M. in the evening completed her except the most difficult part of the\r\nwork that of making her seams secure. I had her turned up and some\r\nsmall fires kindled underneath to dry her. Capt. C. completed a draught\r\nof the river from Fort Mandan to this place which we intend depositing\r\nat this place in order to guard against accedents. not having seen the\r\nSnake Indians or knowing in fact whether to calculate on their\r\nfriendship or hostility or friendship we have conceived our party\r\nsufficiently small and therefore have concluded not to dispatch a canoe\r\nwith a part of our men to St. Louis as we had intended early in the\r\nspring. we fear also that such a measure might possibly discourage\r\nthose who would in such case remain, and might possibly hazzard the\r\nfate of the expedition. we have never once hinted to any one of the\r\nparty that we had such a scheme in contemplation, and all appear\r\nperfectly to have made up their minds to suceed in the expedition or\r\npurish in the attempt. we all beleive that we are now about to enter on\r\nthe most perilous and difficult part of our voyage, yet I see no one\r\nrepining; all appear ready to met those difficulties which wait us with\r\nresolution and becoming fortitude. we had a heavy dew this morning. the\r\nclouds near these mountains rise suddonly and discharge their contents\r\npartially on the neighbouring plains; the same cloud will discharge\r\nhail alone in one part hail and rain in another and rain only in a\r\nthird all within the space of a few miles; and on the Mountains to the\r\nS. E. of us sometimes snow. at present there is no snow on those\r\nmountains; that which covered them when we first saw them and which has\r\nfallen on them several times since has all disappeared. the Mountains\r\nto the N. W. & W. of us are still entirely covered are white and\r\nglitter with the reflection of the sun. I do not beleive that the\r\nclouds which prevail at this season of the year reach the summits of\r\nthose lofty mountains; and if they do the probability is that they\r\ndeposit snow only for there has been no perceptible deminution of the\r\nsnow which they contain since we first saw them. I have thought it\r\nprobable that these mountains might have derived their appellation of\r\nshining Mountains, from their glittering appearance when the sun shines\r\nin certain directions on the snow which covers them. since our arrival\r\nat the falls we have repeatedly witnessed a nois which proceeds from a\r\ndirection a little to the N. of West as loud and resembling precisely\r\nthe discharge of a piece of ordinance of 6 pounds at the distance of\r\nthree miles. I was informed of it by the men several times before I\r\npaid any attention to it, thinking it was thunder most probably which\r\nthey had mistaken at length walking in the plains the other day I heard\r\nthis noise very distictly, it was perfectly calm clear and not a cloud\r\nto be seen, I halted and listened attentively about an hour during\r\nwhich time I heard two other discharges and tok the direction of the\r\nsound with my pocket compass. I have no doubt but if I had leasure I\r\ncould find from whence it issued. I have thout it probable that it\r\nmight be caused by runing water in some of the caverns of those immence\r\nmountains, on the principal of the blowing caverns; but in such case\r\nthe sounds would be periodical & regular, which is not the case with\r\nthis, being sometimes heard once only and at other times, six or seven\r\ndischarges in quick succession. it is heard also at different seasons\r\nof the day and night. I am at a loss to account for this phenomenon.\r\nour work being at an end this evening, we gave the men a drink of\r\nsperits, it being the last of our stock, and some of them appeared a\r\nlittle sensible of it's effects the fiddle was plyed and they danced\r\nvery merrily untill 9 in the evening when a heavy shower of rain put an\r\nend to that part of the amusement tho they continued their mirth with\r\nsongs and festive jokes and were extreemly merry untill late at night.\r\nwe had a very comfortable dinner, of bacon, beans, suit dumplings &\r\nbuffaloe beaf &c. in short we had no just cause to covet the sumptuous\r\nfeasts of our countrymen on this day.--one Elk and a beaver were all\r\nthat was killed by the hunters today; the buffaloe seem to have\r\nwithdrawn themselves from this neighbourhood; tho the men inform us\r\nthat they are still abundant about the falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 4, 1805]\r\n,July the 4th Thursday 1805\r\nA fine morning, a heavy dew last night, all hands employed in\r\nCompleteing the leather boat, gave the Party a dram which made Several\r\nverry lively, a black Cloud came up from the S.

I then set a couple of men to pounding\r\nof charcoal to form a composition with some beeswax which we have and\r\nbuffaloe tallow now my only hope and resource for paying my boat; I\r\nsincerely hope it may answer yet I fear it will not. the boat in every\r\nother rispect completely answers my most sanguine expectation; she is\r\nnot yet dry and eight men can carry her with the greatest ease; she is\r\nstrong and will carry at least 8,000 lbs. with her suit of hands; her\r\nform is as complete as I could wish it. the stitches begin to gape very\r\nmuch since she has began to dry; I am now convinced this would not have\r\nbeen the case had the skins been sewed with a sharp point only and the\r\nleather not cut by the edges of a sharp nedle. about 8 A M. a large\r\nherd of buffaloe came near our camp and Capt. Clark with a party of the\r\nhunters indeavoured to get a shoot at them but the wind proved\r\nunfavourable and they ran off; the hunters pursued and killed three of\r\nthem; we had most of the meat brought in and set a party to drying it.\r\ntheir skins were all brought in and streached to dry for the purpose of\r\ncovering the baggage. 2 Wolves and three Antelopes also killed today.\r\nwe permitted three other men to visit the falls today; these were the\r\nlast of the party who had not as yet indulged themselves with this\r\ngrand and interesting seen. the buffaloe again appear in great numbers\r\nabout our camp and seem to be moving down the river. it is somewhat\r\nremarkable that altho you may see ten or a douzen herds of buffaloe\r\ndistinctly scattered and many miles distant yet if they are undisturbed\r\nby pursuit, they will all be traveling in one direction. the men who\r\nwere permitted to visit the falls today returned in the evening and\r\nreported that the buffaloe were very numerous in that quarter; and as\r\nthe country is more broken near the river in that quarter we conclude\r\nto dispatch a couple of canoes tomorrow with some hunters to kill as\r\nmany as will answer our purposes.\r\n\r\nThe plains in this part of the country are not so fertile as below the\r\nentrance of the Cockkle or missel shell river and from thence down the\r\nMissouri there is also much more stone on the sides of the hills and on\r\nthe broken lands than below.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 5, 1805]\r\nJuly 5th Friday 1805\r\nA fine morning and but little wind, worm and Sultrey at 8 oClock--I Saw\r\na large gangue of Buffalow and prosued them with Several men the wind\r\nwas unfavourable and we Could not get near them, the party Scattered &\r\nKilled 3 buffalow and brought in their Skins and Some meat, Killed 2\r\nwolves & 3 Antilopes for their Skins, Capt.

Clarks black man York is very unwell today and he\r\ngave him a doze of tartar emettic which operated very well and he was\r\nmuch better in the evening. this is a discription of medecine that I\r\nnevr have recourse to in my practice except in cases of the\r\nintermittent fever. this evening the hunters returned with the canoes\r\nand brought thre buffaloe skins only and two Antelope 4 deer and three\r\nwolf skins; they reported that the buffaloe had gone further down the\r\nriver. the two hunters whom we sent out from hence returned also\r\nwithout having killed anything except one Elk. I set one of the party\r\nat work to make me some sacks of the wolf skins, to transport my\r\nInstruments when occasion requirs their being carried any distance by\r\nland.--we had a light shower of rain about 4 P.M. attended with some\r\nthunder and lightning. one beaver caught this morning. the musquetoes\r\nare excessively troublesome to us. I have prepared my composition which\r\nI should have put on this evening but the rain prevented me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 7, 1805]\r\nJuly 7th Sunday 1805\r\nA Warm day wind from the S.

Clark Determined to make a second effort to replace the notes\r\nwhich he had made with rispect to the river and falls accordingly he\r\nset out after an early breakfast and took with him the greater part of\r\nthe men with a view also to kill buffaloe should there be any in that\r\nquarter. after geting some distance in the plains he divided the party\r\nand sent them in different directions and himself and two others struck\r\nthe Missouri at the entrance of medicine river and continued down it to\r\nthe great Cataract, from whence he returned through the plains to camp\r\nwhere he arrived late in the evening. the hunters also returned having\r\nkilled 3 buffaloe 2 Antelopes and a deer. he informed me that the\r\nimmence herds of buffaloe which we had seen for some time past in this\r\nneighbourhood have almost entirely disappeared and he beleives are gone\r\ndown the river.\r\n\r\nThe day being warm and fair about 12 OCk. the boat was sufficiently dry\r\nto receive a coat of the composition which I accordingly applyed. this\r\nadds very much to her appearance whether it will be effectual or not.\r\nit gives her hull the appearance of being formed of one solid piece.\r\nafter the first coat had cooled I gave her a second which I think has\r\nmade it sufficiently thick. The mountains which ly before us from the\r\nSouth, to the N. W. still continue covered with snow. one hunter also\r\npassed the river to hunt this morning in the evening he returned having\r\nkilled a Buck and a male Antelope. The party who were down with Capt.\r\nClark also killed a small fox which they brought with them. it was a\r\nfemale appeared to give suck, otherwise it is so much like the comm\r\nsmall fox of this country commonly called the kit fox that I should\r\nhave taken it for a young one of that species; however on closer\r\nexamination it did apear to differ somewhat; it's colour was of a\r\nlighter brown, it's years proportionably larger, and the tale not so\r\nlarge or the hair not so long which formed it. they are very delicately\r\nformed, exceedingly fleet, and not as large as the common domestic cat.\r\ntheir tallons appear longer than any species of fox I ever saw and seem\r\ntherefore prepared more amply by nature for the purpose of burrowing.\r\nthere is sufficient difference for discrimination between it and the\r\nkit fox, and to satisfy me perfectly that it is a distinct species. the\r\nmen also brought me a living ground squirrel which is something larger\r\nthan those of the U States or those of that kind which are also common\r\nhere. this is a much hadsomer anamal. like the other it's principal\r\ncolour is a redish brown but is marked longitudinally with a much\r\ngreater number of black or dark bron stripes; the spaces between which\r\nis marked by ranges of pure white circular spots, about the size of a\r\nbrister blue shot. these colours imbrace the head neck back and sides;\r\nthe tail is flat, or the long hair projecting horizontally from two\r\nsides of it only gives it that appearance. the belly and breast are of\r\nmuch lighter brown or nearly white. this is an inhabitant of the open\r\nplain altogether, wher it burrows and resides; nor is it like the other\r\nfound among clifts of rocks or in the woodlands. their burrows\r\nsometimes like those of the mole run horizontally near the surface of\r\nthe ground for a considerable distance, but those in which they reside\r\nor take refuge strike much deeper in the earth.--Slight rain this\r\nafternoon. musquetoes troublesome as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 8, 1805]\r\nJuly 8th Monday 1805\r\nA worm morning flying Clouds I deturmin take the width of the river at\r\nthe falls & the Medison river and to take the greater part of the men\r\nwhich Can be Speared to Kill Buffalow for their Skins as well as meat,\r\ndevided the party & Sent them in different directions to hunt &\r\nproceeded my Self to the mouth of Medison river measured it and found\r\nit to be 137 yards wide, in the narrowest part of the Missouri\r\nimediately above Medison river the Missouri is 300 yards wide, below\r\nand a little above the falls 1440 yards wide with the direction of the\r\nupper great fall 580 yards wide, at the great Spring 270 yards wide, at\r\nthe handsom falls of 47 ft. 8 I. the river is 473 yards wide, at the\r\nlower great falls the river is confined within 280 yards, below the\r\nfalls the water occupies 93 yards only--after takeing the wedth of the\r\nriver at those Sundery placies I returned thro the plains in a direct\r\nline to Camp. Some rain this evening after a verry hot day.--the\r\nmountains which are in view to the South & N W. are Covered with Snow.\r\nthose nearer us and forma 3/4 Circle around us is not Covered with Snow\r\nat this time. The hunters killed 3 buffalow, two antelopes, & a Deer to\r\nday--the emence herds of buffalow which was near us a fiew days ago,\r\nhas proceeded on down the river, we Can See but a fiew Bulls in the\r\nplains\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 9, 1805]\r\nTuesday July 9th 1805.\r\nThe morning was fair and pleant. the Islands seem crouded with\r\nblackbirds; the young brude is now completely feathered and flying in\r\ncommon with the others. we corked the canoes and put them in the water\r\nand also launched the boat, she lay like a perfect cork on the water.\r\nfive men would carry her with the greatest ease. I now directed seats\r\nto be fixed in her and oars to be fitted. the men loaded the canoes in\r\nreadiness to depart. just at this moment a violent wind commenced and\r\nblew so hard that we were obliged to unload the canoes again; a part of\r\nthe baggage in several of them got wet before it could be taken out.\r\nthe wind continued violent untill late in the evening, by which time we\r\ndiscovered that a greater part of the composition had seperated from\r\nthe skins and left the seams of the boat exposed to the water and she\r\nleaked in such manner that she would not answer. I need not add that\r\nthis circumstance mortifyed me not a little; and to prevent her leaking\r\nwithout pich was impossible with us, and to obtain this article was\r\nequally impossible, therefore the evil was irraparable I now found that\r\nthe section formed of the buffaloe hides on which some hair had been\r\nleft, answered much the best purpose; this leaked but little and the\r\nparts which were well covered with hair about 1/8th of an inch in\r\nlength retained the composition perfectly and remained sound and dry.\r\nfrom these circumstances I am preswaided, that had I formed her with\r\nbuffaloe skins singed not quite as close as I had done those I\r\nemployed, that she would have answered even with this composition. but\r\nto make any further experiments in our present situation seemed to me\r\nmadness; the buffaloe had principally dserted us, and the season was\r\nnow advancing fast. I therefore relinquished all further hope of my\r\nfavorite boat and ordered her to be sunk in the water, that the skins\r\nmight become soft in order the better to take her in peices tomorrow\r\nand deposite the iron fraim at this place as it could probably be of no\r\nfurther service to us. had I only singed my Elk skins in stead of\r\nshaving them I beleive the composition would have remained and the boat\r\nhave answered; at least untill we could have reached the pine country\r\nwhich must be in advance of us from the pine which is brought down by\r\nthe water and which is probably at no great distance where we might\r\nhave supplyed ourselves with the necessary pich or gum. but it was now\r\ntoo late to introduce a remidy and I bid a dieu to my boat, and her\r\nexpected services.--The next difficulty which presented itself was how\r\nwe should convey the stores and baggage which we had purposed carrying\r\nin the boat. both Capt. Clark and myself recollected having heard the\r\nhunters mention that the bottoms of the river some few miles above us\r\nwere much better timbered than below and that some of the trees were\r\nlarge. the idea therefore suggested itself of building two other canoes\r\nsufficiently large to carry the surplus baggage. on enquiry of the\r\nhunters it seemed to be the general opinion that trees sufficiently a\r\nlarge for this purpose might be obtained in a bottom on the opposite\r\nside about 8 miles distant by land and reather more than double that\r\ndistance by water; accordingly Capt. Clark determined to set out early\r\nin the morning with ten of the best workmen and proceede by land to\r\nthat place while the others would in the mean time be employed by\r\nmyself in taking the Boat in peices and depositing her, together with\r\nthe articles which we had previously determined to deposit at this\r\nplace, and also in trasporting all the baggage up the river to that\r\npoint in the six small canoes. this plan being settled between us\r\norders were accordingly given to the party, and the ten men who were to\r\naccompany Capt. Clark had ground and prepared their axes and adds this\r\nevening in order to prepare for an early departure in the morning. we\r\nhave on this as well as on many former occasions found a small\r\ngrindstone which I brought with me from Harper's ferry extreemly\r\nconvenient to us. if we find trees at the place mentioned sufficiently\r\nlarge for our purposes it will be extreemly fortunate; for we have not\r\nseen one for many miles below the entrance of musselshell River to this\r\nplace, which would have answered.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 9, 1805]\r\nJuly 9th Tuesday 1805\r\na clear worm morning wind from the S W.

Clark set out with his party early this morning and passed over\r\nto the opposite side. after which I dispatched Sergt. Ordway with 4\r\nCanoes and 8 men to take up a load of baggage as far as Capt. Clark's\r\ncamp and return for the remainder of our plunder. with six others I now\r\nset to work on my boat, which had been previously drawn out of the\r\nwater before the men departed, and in two hours had her fraim in\r\nreadiness to be deposited. had a cash dug and deposited the Fraim of\r\nthe boat, some papers and a few other trivial articles of but little\r\nimportance. the wind blew very hard the greater part of the day. I also\r\nhad the truck wheels buried in the pit which had been made to hold the\r\ntar. having nothing further to do I amused myself in fishing and caught\r\na few small fish; they were of the species of white chub mentioned\r\nbelow the falls, tho they are small and few in number. I had thought on\r\nmy first arrival here that there were no fish in this part of the\r\nriver. Capt. Clark proceeded up the river 8 miles by land (distance by\r\nwater 231/4) and found 2 trees of Cottonwood and cut them down; one\r\nproved to be hollow and split in falling at the upper part and was\r\nsomewhat windshaken at bottom; the other proved to be much windshaken.\r\nhe surched the bottom for better but could not find any he therefore\r\ndetermined to make canoes of those which he had fallen; and to contract\r\ntheir length in such manner as to clear the craks and the worst of the\r\nwindsken parts making up the deficiency by allowing them to be as wide\r\nas the trees would permit. they were much at a loss for wood to make\r\naxhandles. the Chokecherry is the best we can procure for this purpose\r\nand of that wood they made and broke thir 13 handles in the course of\r\nthis part of a day. had the eyes of our axes been round they would have\r\nanswered this country much better. the musquetoes were very troublesome\r\nto them as well as ourselves today. Sergt. Ordway proceeded up the\r\nriver about 5 miles when the wind became so violent that he was obliged\r\nto ly by untill late in the evening when he again set out with the\r\ncanoes and arrived within 3 miles of Capt. Clark's Camp where he halted\r\nfor the night. about five miles above whitebear camp there are two\r\nIslands in the river covered with Cottonwood box alder and some sweet\r\nwillow also the undergrowth like that of the islands at this place.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 10, 1805]\r\nJuly 10th Wednesday 1805\r\na fair windey day wind hard the most of the day from the S.

I Set out with Sergt.\r\nPryor four Choppers two Involids & one man to hunt, Crossed to the Std.\r\nSide and proceeded on up the river 8 miles by land (distance by water\r\n231/4 ms.) and found two Trees which I thought would make Canoes, had\r\nthem fallen, one of them proved to be hollow & Split at one End & verry\r\nmuch win Shaken at the other, the other much win Shaken, we Serched the\r\nbottoms for better trees and made a trial of Several which proved to be\r\nmore indifferent. I deturmined to make Canoes out of the two first\r\ntrees we had fallen, to Contract thir length so as to clear the hollow\r\n& winshakes, & ad to the width as much as the tree would allow. The\r\nMusquitors emencely noumerous & troublesom, Killed two deer & a goat.\r\nThe Canoes did not arrive as I expected, owing to the hard wind which\r\nblew a head in maney places. we ar much at a loss for wood to make ax\r\nhilthes,13 hath been made & broken in this piece of a day by the four\r\nChoppers, no other wood but Cotton Box elder Choke Cherry and red arrow\r\nwood. we Substitute the Cherry in place of Hickory for ax hilthes ram\r\nrods, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 11, 1805]\r\nThursday July 11th 1805.\r\nWe had now nothing to do but wait for the canoes; as they had not\r\nreturned I sent out some of the small party with me to hunt; in the\r\nevening they returned with a good quantity of the flesh of a fat\r\nbuffaloe which they had killed. the canoes not arrived this evening. I\r\nsaw several very large grey Eagles today they are a half as large again\r\nas the common bald Eagle of this country. I do not think the bald Eagle\r\nhere qute so large as those of the U States; the grey Eagle is\r\ninfinitely larger and is no doubt a distinct species. this evening a\r\nlittle before the sun set I heared two other discharges of this\r\nunaccounable artillery of the Rocky Mountains proceeding from the same\r\nquarter that I had before heard it. I now recollected the Minnetares\r\nmaking mention of the nois which they had frequently heard in the Rocky\r\nMountains like thunder; and which they said the mountains made; but I\r\npaid no attention to the information supposing it either false or the\r\nfantom of a supersticious immagination. I have also been informed by\r\nthe engages that the Panis and Ricaras give the same account of the\r\nBlack mountains which lye West of them. this phenomenon the philosophy\r\nof the engages readily accounts for; they state it to be the bursting\r\nof the rich mines of silver which these mountains contain.\r\n\r\nThis morning Capt. Clark dispatched Bratton to meet the canoes which\r\nwere detained by the wind to get a couple of axes. he obtained the axes\r\nand returned in about two hours. this man has been unable to work for\r\nseveral days in consequence of a whitlow on one of his fingers; a\r\ncomplaint which has been very common among the men. one of the canoes\r\narrived at Capt. Clarks camp about 10 A.M. this he had unloaded and set\r\na few miles up the river for a buffaloe which had been killed, the\r\nparty sent killed another in thir rout and brought in the flesh and\r\nskins of both they were in good order; his hunters had also killed two\r\ndeer and an Antelope yesterday. the three other canoes did not arrive\r\nuntill late in the evening in consequence of the wind and the fear of\r\nweting their loads which consisted of articles much more liable to be\r\ninjured by moisture than those which composed the load of that which\r\narrived in the morning. Capt. C. had the canoes unloaded and ordered\r\nthem to float down in the course of the night to my camp, but the wind\r\nproved so high after night that they were obliged to put too about 8\r\nmiles above and remain untill morning. Capt. C. kept the party with him\r\nbusily engaged at the canoes. his hunters killed and brought in three\r\nvery fat deer this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 11, 1805]\r\nJuly 11th Thursday 1805\r\na fair windey morning wind S.

Musquitors verry troublesom, and in addition to their torments\r\nwe have a Small Knat, which is as disagreeable, our hunter killed 3\r\nDeer to day one of them verry fat. all the men with me engaged about\r\nthe Canoes hunting &c. &.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 12, 1805]\r\nFriday July 12th 1805.\r\nThe canoes not having arrived and the wind still high I dispatched\r\nSergt. Gass with three men to join Capt. Clark and assist in completing\r\nthe canoes retaining only a few who in addition to those in the canoes\r\nthat I expect every moment, will be sufficient to man the six canoes\r\nand take up all the baggage we have here at one load. I feel\r\nexcessively anxious to be moving on. the canoes were detained by the\r\nwind untill 2 P.M. when they set out and arrived at this place so late\r\nthat I thought it best to detain them untill morning. Bratton came down\r\ntoday for a cople of axes which I sent by him; he returned immediately.\r\nSergt. Gass and party joined Capt. Clark at 10 A.M. Capt. C. kept all\r\nthe men with him busily engaged some in drying meat, others in hunting,\r\nand as many as could be employed about the canoes. Segt. Pryor got his\r\nsholder dislocated yesterday, it was replaced immediately and is likely\r\nto do him but little injury; it is painfull to him today. the hunters\r\nwith Capt. C. killed three deer and two otter today. the otter are now\r\nplenty since the water has become sufficiently clear for them to take\r\nfish. the blue crested fisher, or as they are sometimes called the\r\nKingfisher, is an inhabitant of this part of the country; this bird is\r\nvery rare on the Missouri; I have not seen more than three or four of\r\nthose birds during my voyage from the entrance of the Missouri to the\r\nmouth of Maria's river and those few were reather the inhabitants of\r\nstreams of clerer water which discharged themselves into the Missouri\r\nthan of that river, as they were seen about the entrances of such\r\nstreams. Musquetoes extreemly troublesome to me today nor is a large\r\nblack knat less troublesome, which dose not sting, but attacks the eye\r\nin swarms and compells us to brush them off or have our eyes filled\r\nwith them. I made the men dry the ballance of the freshe meet which we\r\nhad abot the camp amounting to about 200 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 12, 1805]\r\nJuly 12th Friday 1805\r\na fair windey morning wind from the S.

I\r\nnow bid a cheerfull adue to my camp and passed over to the opposite\r\nshore. Baptiest La Page one of the men whom I had reserved to man the\r\ncanoes being sick I sent Charbono in his stead by water and the sick\r\nman and Indian woman accompanyed me by land. from the head of the white\r\nbear Islands I passed in a S. W. direction and struck the Missouri at 3\r\nmiles and continued up it to Capt. Clark's camp where I arrived about 9\r\nA.M. and found them busily engaged with their canoes Meat &c. in my way\r\nI passed a very extraordinary Indian lodge, or at least the fraim of\r\none; it was formed of sixteen large cottonwood poles each about fifty\r\nfeet long and at their larger end which rested on the ground as thick\r\nas a man's body; these were arranged in a circular manner at bottom and\r\nequally distributed except the omission of one on the East side which I\r\nsuppose was the entrance to the lodge; the upper part of the poles are\r\nunited in a common point above and secured with large wyths of willow\r\nbrush. in the center of this fabric there was the remains of a large\r\nfire; and about the place the marks of about 80 leather lodges. I know\r\nnot what was the intention or design of such a lodge but certain I am\r\nthat it was not designed for a dwelling of anyone family. it was 216\r\nfeet in circumpherence at the base. it was most probably designed for\r\nsome great feast, or a council house on some great national concern. I\r\nnever saw a similar one nor do the nations lower down the Missouri\r\nconstruct such. The canoes and party with Sergt. Ordway poceeded up the\r\nriver about 5 miles when the wind became so violent that two of the\r\ncanoes shiped a considerable quanty of water and they were compelled to\r\nput too take out the baggage to dry and clense the canoes of the water.\r\nabout 5 P.M. the wind abated and they came on about 8 miles further and\r\nencamped. I saw a number of turtledoves and some pigeons today. of the\r\nlatter I shot one; they are the same common to the United States, or\r\nthe wild pigeon as they are called. nothing remarkable in the\r\nappearance of the country; the timber entirely confined to the river\r\nand the country back on either side as far as the eye can reach\r\nentirely destitute of trees or brush. the timber is larger and more\r\nabundant in the bottom in which we now are than I have seen it on the\r\nMissouri for many hundred miles. the current of the river is still\r\nextreemly gentle. The hunters killed three buffaloe today which were in\r\ngood order. the flesh was brought in dryed the skins wer also streached\r\nfor covering our baggage. we eat an emensity of meat; it requires 4\r\ndeer, an Elk and a deer, or one buffaloe, to supply us plentifully 24\r\nhours. meat now forms our food prinsipally as we reserve our flour\r\nparched meal and corn as much as possible for the rocky mountains which\r\nwe are shortly to enter, and where from the indhan account game is not\r\nvery abundant. I preserved specemines of several small plants to day\r\nwhich I have never before seen. The Musquetoes and knats are more\r\ntroublesome here if possible than they were at the White bear Islands.\r\nI sent a man to the canoes for my musquetoe bier which I had neglected\r\nto bring with me, as it is impossible to sleep a moment without being\r\ndefended against the attacks of these most tormenting of all insects;\r\nthe man returned with it a little after dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 13, 1805]\r\nJuly 13th Saturday 1805.\r\na fair Calm Morning, verry Cool before day--we were visited by a\r\nBuffalow Bull who came within a fiew Steps of one of the Canoes the men\r\nwere at work.

I walked out today and ascended the\r\nbluffs which are high rockey and steep; I continued my rout about 31/2\r\nwhen I gained a conspicuous eminence about 2 mes. distant from the\r\nriver a little below the entrance of Fort Mountain Creek. from this\r\nplace I had a commanding view of the country and took the bearings of\r\nthe following places. (viz)\r\n\r\nTo the point at which the Missouri first enters the Rocky Mountains\r\nS. 28° W.\r\n25\r\nTo the termineation of the 1st Chain of Rocky Mountains; northwardly,\r\nbeing that through which the Missouri first passes\r\nN. 73° W\r\n80\r\nTo the extremity or tirmineation of 2cd Chain of the Rocky Mountains\r\nN. 65 W.\r\n150\r\nTo the most distant point of a third and continued chain of  the same\r\nmts\r\nN. 50°W.\r\n200\r\nThe direction of the 2cd Do. from S 45 E. to N. 45 W.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Fort Mountain\r\nS. 75° W.\r\n8\r\n\r\nThe country in most parts very level and in others swelling with gentle\r\nrises and decents, or in other wirds what I have heretofore designated\r\na wavy country destitute of timber except along the water-courses. On\r\nmy return to camp found Sergt. Ordway had arrived with all the canoes\r\nabout noon and had unloaded them every preperation except the entire\r\ncompletion of the oars poles &c is made for our departure tomorrow. the\r\ngrass and weeds in this bottom are about 2 feet high; which is a much\r\ngreater hight than we have seen them elsewhere this season. here I\r\nfound the sand rush and nittles in small quantities. the grass in the\r\nplains is not more than 3 inches high. grasshoppers innumerable in the\r\nplains and the small birds before noticed together with the brown\r\nCurlooe still continue nomerous in every part of the plains.\r\n\r\nhad a slight shower at 4 P.M. this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 14, 1805]\r\nJuly 14th Sunday 1805\r\na fine morning Calm and worm musquetors & Knats verry troublesom.

At 10 A.M. we once more saw ourselves fairly under\r\nway much to my joy and I beleive that of every individual who compose\r\nthe party. I walked on shore and killed 2 Elk near one of which the\r\nparty halted and dined. we took the skins marrow bones and a part of\r\nthe flesh of these Elk. in order to lighten the burthen of the canoes I\r\ncontinued my walk all the evening and took our only invalledes Potts an\r\nLaPage with me. we passed the river near where we dined and just above\r\nthe entrance of a beautifull river 80 yards wide which falls in on the\r\nLard. side which in honour of Mr. Robert Smith the Secretary of the\r\nNavy we called Smith's River. this stream meanders through a most\r\nlovely valley to the S. E. for about 25 miles when it enters the Rocky\r\nmountains and is concealed from our view. many herds of buffaloe were\r\nfeeding in this valley. we again crossed the river to the Stard. side\r\nand passed through a plain and struck the river at a Northwardly bend\r\nwhere there was timber here we waited untill the canoes arrived by\r\nwhich time it was so late that we concluded to encamp for the night.\r\nhere Drewyer wouded a deer which ran into the river my dog pursued\r\ncaught it drowned it and brought it to shore at our camp. we have now\r\npassed Fort Mountain on our right it appears to be about ten miles\r\ndistant. this mountain has a singular appearance it is situated in a\r\nlevel plain, it's sides stand nearly at right angles with each other\r\nand are each about a mile in extent. these are formed of a yellow clay\r\nonly without the mixture of rock or stone of any size and rise\r\nperpendicularly to the hight of 300 feet. the top appears to be a level\r\nplain and from the eminence on which I was yesterday I could see that\r\nit was covered with a similar cost of grass with the plain on which it\r\nstands. the surface appears also to possess a tolerable fertile mole of\r\n2 feet thick. and is to all appearance inaccessible. from it's figure\r\nwe gave it the name of fort mountain. those mounds before mentioned\r\nnear the falls have much the same appearance but are none of them as\r\nlarge as this one. the prickly pear is now in full blume and forms one\r\nof the beauties as well as the greatest pests of the plains. the\r\nsunflower is also in blume and is abundant. this plant is common to\r\nevery part of the Missouri from it's entrance to this place. the\r\nlambsquarter, wild coucumber, sand rush and narrow dock are also common\r\nhere. Drewyer killed another deer and an Otter today. we find it\r\ninconvenient to take all the short meanders of the river which has now\r\nbecome cooked and much narrower than below, we therefore take it's\r\ngeneral course and lay down the small bends by the eye on our daily\r\ntraverse or chart. the river is from too to 150 yds. wide. more timber\r\non the river than below the falls for a great distance. on the banks of\r\nthe river there are many large banks of sand much elivated above the\r\nplains on which they ly and appear as if they had been collected in the\r\ncourse of time from the river by the almost incessant S. W. winds; they\r\nalways appear on the sides of the river opposite to those winds.\r\n\r\nThe couses and distances from the White bear islands to the camp at\r\nwhich we made the canoes as taken by Sergt.

Capt\r\nLew Killed 2 Elk & the hunters killed 2 Deer & a Ortter, we Camped on\r\nthe Stard Side at which place I Saw many beaver, the timber on the edge\r\nof the river more Common than below the falls--as I am compelled to\r\nwalk on Shore find it verry dificuelt to take the Courses of the river,\r\nas it is verry Crooked more So than below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 16, 1805]\r\nTuesday July 16th 1805.\r\nWe had a heavy dew last night sen one man back this morning for an ax\r\nthat he had carelessly left last evening some miles below, and set out\r\nat an early hour. early this morning we passed about 40 little booths\r\nformed of willow bushes to shelter them from the sun; they appeared to\r\nhave been deserted about 10 days; we supposed that they were snake\r\nIndians. they appeared to have a number of horses with them-. this\r\nappearance gives me much hope of meeting with these people shortly.\r\nDrewyer killed a buffaloe this morning near the river and we halted and\r\nbreakfasted on it. here for the first time I ate of the small guts of\r\nthe buffaloe cooked over a blazing fire in the Indian stile without any\r\npreperation of washing or other clensing and found them very good.-\r\nAfter breakfast I determined to leave Capt. C. and party, and go on to\r\nthe point where the river enters the Rocky Mountains and make the\r\nnecessary observations against their arrival; accordingly I set out\r\nwith the two invalleds Potts and LaPage and Drewyer; I passed through a\r\nvery handsome level plain on the Stard. side of the river, the country\r\nequally level and beautiful) on the opposite side; at the distance of 8\r\nmes. passed a small stream on which I observed a considerable quantity\r\nof aspin. a little before 12 I halted on the river at a Stard. bend and\r\nwell timbered bottom about 41/2 miles below the mountains and made the\r\nfollowing observation.\r\n\r\nafter this observation we pursued our rout through a high roling plain\r\nto a rappid immediately at the foot of the mountain where the Missouri\r\nfirst enters them. the current of the missouri below these rappids is\r\nstrong for several miles, tho just above there is scarcely any current,\r\nthe river very narrow and deep abot 70 yds. wide only and seems to be\r\nclosely hemned in by the mountains on both sides, the bottoms only a\r\nfew yards in width. an Indian road enters the mountain at the same\r\nplace with the river on the Stard side and continues along it's border\r\nunder the steep clifts these mountains appear to be only about 800 feet\r\nabove the river and are formed almost entirely of a hard black\r\ngrannite. with a few dwarf pine and cedar scattered on them. at this\r\nplace there is a large rock of 400 feet high wich stands immediately in\r\nthe gap which the missouri makes on it's passage from the mountains; it\r\nis insulated from the neighbouring mountains by a handsome little plain\r\nwhich surrounds it base on 3 sides and the Missouri washes it's base on\r\nthe other, leaving it on the Lard. as it decends. this rock I called\r\nthe tower. it may be ascended with some difficulty nearly to it's\r\nsummit, and from it there is a most pleasing view of the country we are\r\nnow about to leave. from it I saw this evening immence herds of\r\nbuffaloe in the plains below. near this place we killed a fat elk on\r\nwhich we both dined and suped. the Musquetoes are extreemly troublesome\r\nthis evening and I had left my bier, of course suffered considerably,\r\nand promised in my wrath that I never will be guily of a similar peice\r\nof negligence while on this voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 16, 1805]\r\nJuly 16th Tuesday 1805\r\na fair morning after a verry cold night, heavy dew, dispatched one man\r\nback for an ax left a fiew miles below, and Set out early Killed a\r\nBuffalow on which we Brackfast Capt Lewis & 3 men went on to the\r\nmountain to take a meridian altitude, passed about 40 Small Camps,\r\nwhich appeared to be abandoned about 10 or 12 days, Suppose they were\r\nSnake Indians, a fiew miles above I Saw the poles Standing in thir\r\nposition of a verry large lodge of 60 feet Diamater, & the appearance\r\nof a number of Leather Lodges about, this Sign was old & appeared to\r\nhave been last fall great number of buffalow the river is not So wide\r\nas below from 100 to 150 yards wide & Deep Crouded with Islands &\r\nCrooked Some Scattering timber on its edge Such as Cotton wood Cotton\r\nwillow, willow and box elder, the Srubs are arrow wod, red wood, Choke\r\nCherry, red berries, Goose beries, Sarvis burey, red & yellow Currents\r\na Spcie of Shomake &c.\r\n\r\nI camped on the head of a Small Island near the Stard. Shore at the\r\nRockey Mountains this Range of mountains appears to run N W & S E and\r\nis about 800 feet higher than the Water in the river faced with a hard\r\nblack rock the current of the River from the Medison river to the\r\nmountain is gentle bottoms low and extensive, and its General Course is\r\nS. 10° W. about 30 miles on a direct line\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 17, 1805]\r\nWednesday July 17th 1805.\r\nThe sunflower is in bloom and abundant in the river bottoms. The\r\nIndians of the Missouri particularly those who do not cultivate maze\r\nmake great uce of the seed of this plant for bread, or use it in\r\nthickening their scope. they most commonly first parch the seed and\r\nthen pound them between two smooth stones until) they reduce it to a\r\nfine meal. to this they sometimes mearly add a portion of water and\r\ndrink it in that state, or add a sufficient quantity of marrow grease\r\nto reduce it to the consistency of common dough and eate it in that\r\nmanner. the last composition I think much best and have eat it in that\r\nstate heartily and think it a pallateable dish. there is but little of\r\nthe broad leafed cottonwood above the falls, much the greater portion\r\nbeing of the narrow leafed kind. there are a great abundance of red\r\nyellow perple & black currants, and service berries now ripe and in\r\ngreat perfection. I find these fruits very pleasent particularly the\r\nyellow currant which I think vastly preferable to those of our gardens.\r\nthe shrub which produces this fruit rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet;\r\nthe stem simple branching and erect. they grow closly ascociated in\r\ncops either in the oppen or timbered lands near the watercouses. the\r\nleaf is petiolate of a pale green and resembles in it's form that of\r\nthe red currant common to our gardens. the perianth of the\r\nfructification is one leaved, five cleft, abreviated and tubular, the\r\ncorolla is monopetallous funnel-shaped; very long, superior, withering\r\nand of a fine orrange colour. five stamens and one pistillum; of the\r\nfirst, the fillaments are capillare, inserted into the corolla, equal,\r\nand converging; the anther ovate, biffid and incumbent. with rispect to\r\nthe second the germ is roundish, smoth, inferior pedicelled and small;\r\nthe style, long, and thicker than the stamens, simple, cylindrical,\r\nsmooth, and erect, withering and remains with the corolla untill the\r\nfruit is ripe. stigma simple obtuse and withering.--the fruit is a\r\nberry about the size and much the shape of the red currant of our\r\ngardins, like them growing in clusters supported by a compound\r\nfootstalk, but the peduncles which support the several berries are\r\nlonger in this species and the berries are more scattered. it is quite\r\nas transparent as the red current of our gardens, not so ascid, & more\r\nagreeably flavored. the other species differ not at all in appearance\r\nfrom the yellow except in the colour and flavor of their berries. I am\r\nnot confident as to the colour of the corolla, but all those which I\r\nobserved while in blume as we came up the Missouri were yellow but they\r\nmight possibly have been all of the yellow kind and that the perple red\r\nand black currants here may have corollas of different tints from that\r\nof the yellow currant.--The survice berry differs somewhat from that of\r\nthe U States the bushes are small sometimes not more than 2 feet high\r\nand scarcely ever exceed 8 and are proportionably small in their stems,\r\ngrowing very thickly ascosiated in clumps. the fruit is the same form\r\nbut for the most part larger more lucious and of so deep a perple that\r\non first sight you would think them black.--there are two species of\r\ngoosbirris here allso but neither of them yet ripe. the choke cherries\r\nalso abundant and not yet ripe. there is Box alder, red willow and a\r\nspecies of sumac here also. there is a large pine tree situated on a\r\nsmall island at the head of these rappids above our camp; it being the\r\nfirst we have seen for a long distance near the river I called the\r\nisland pine island. This range of the rocky mountains runs from S E to\r\nN. W.--at 8 A.M. this morning Capt. Clark arrived with the party. we\r\ntook breakfast here, after which I had the box which contained my\r\ninstruments taken by land arround tower rock to the river above the\r\nrappid; the canoes ascended with some difficulty but without loss or\r\ninjury, with their loads.\r\n\r\nAfter making those observations we proceed, and as the canoes were\r\nstill heavy loaded all persons not employed in navigating the canoes\r\nwalled on shore. the river clifts were so steep and frequently\r\nprojecting into the river with their perpendicular points in such\r\nmanner that we could not pass them by land, we wer therefore compelled\r\nto pass and repass the river very frequently in the couse of the\r\nevening. the bottoms are narrow the river also narrow deep and but\r\nlittle current. river from 70 to 100 yds. wide. but little timber on\r\nthe river aspin constitutes a part of that little. see more pine than\r\nusual on the mountains tho still but thinly scattered. we saw some\r\nmountain rams or bighorned anamals this evening, and no other game\r\nwhatever and indeed there is but little appearance of any. in some\r\nplaces both banks of the river are formed for a short distance of\r\nnearly perpendicular rocks of a dark black grannite of great hight; the\r\nriver has the appearance of having cut it's passage in the course of\r\ntime through this solid rock. we ascended about 6 miles this evening\r\nfrom the entrance of the mountain and encamped on the Stard. side where\r\nwe found as much wood as made our fires. musquetoes still troublesome\r\nknats not as much so.--Capt. C. now informed me that after I left him\r\nyesterday, he saw the poles of a large lodge in praire on the Stard.\r\nside of the river which was 60 feet in diameter and appeared to have\r\nbeen built last fall; there were the remains of about 80 leather lodges\r\nnear the place of the same apparent date. This large lodge was of the\r\nsame construction of that mentioned above the white bear Islands. the\r\nparty came on very well and encamped on the lower point of an island\r\nnear the Stard. shore on that evening. this morning they had set out\r\nearly and proceeded without obstruction untill they reached the rappid\r\nwhere I was encamped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 17, 1805]\r\nJuly 17th Wednesday 1805\r\nSet out early this morning and Crossed the rapid at the Island Cald\r\npine rapid with Some dificuelty, at this rapid I came up with Capt\r\nLewis & party took a Medn. altitude & we took Some Luner Observations\r\n&c. and proceeded on, the emence high Precipies oblige all the party to\r\npass & repass the river from one point to another the river confined in\r\nmaney places in a verry narrow Chanel from 70 to 120 yards wide bottoms\r\nnarrow without timber and maney places the mountain approach on both\r\nSides, we observe great deel of Scattering pine on the mountains, Some\r\naspin, Spruce & fur trees took a meridian altd. which gave for\r\nLattitude 46° 42' 14\" 7/10 N we proceeded on verry well about 8 miles &\r\nCamped on the Stard Side The river crooked bottoms narrow, Clifts high\r\nand Steep, I assended a Spur of the Mountain which I found to be highe\r\n& dificuelt of axcess, Containig Pitch Pine & Covered with grass\r\nScercely any game to be Seen The yellow Current now ripe also the\r\nfussey red Choke Cheries getting ripe Purple Current are also ripe. Saw\r\nSeveral Ibex or mountain rams to day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 18, 1805]\r\nThursday July 18th 1805.\r\nSet out early this morning. previous to our departure saw a large herd\r\nof the Bighorned anamals on the immencely high and nearly perpendicular\r\nclift opposite to us; on the fase of this clift they walked about and\r\nhounded from rock to rock with apparent unconcern where it appared to\r\nme that no quadruped could have stood, and from which had they made one\r\nfalse step they must have been precipitated at least a 500 feet. this\r\nanamal appears to frequent such precepices and clifts where in fact\r\nthey are perfectly secure from the pursuit of the wolf, bear, or even\r\nman himself.--at the distance of 21/2 miles we passed the entrance of a\r\nconsiderable river on the Stard. side; about 80 yds. wide being nearly\r\nas wide as the Missouri at that place. it's current is rapid and water\r\nextreamly transparent; the bed is formed of small smooth stones of flat\r\nrounded or other figures. it's bottoms are narrow but possess as much\r\ntimber as the Missouri. the country is mountainous and broken through\r\nwhich it passes. it appears as if it might be navigated but to what\r\nextent must be conjectural. this handsome bold and clear stream we\r\nnamed in honour of the Secretary of war calling it Dearborn's river.-\r\nas we were anxious now to meet with the Sosonees or snake Indians as\r\nsoon as possible in order to obtain information relative to the\r\ngeography of the country and also if necessary, some horses we thought\r\nit better for one of us either Capt. C. or myself to take a small party\r\n& proceed on up the river, some distance before the canoes, in order to\r\ndiscover them, should they be on the river before the daily discharge\r\nof our guns, which was necessary in procuring subsistence for the\r\nparty, should allarm and cause them to retreat to the mountains and\r\nconceal themselves, supposing us to be their enemies who visit them\r\nusually by the way of this river. accordingly Capt. Clark set out this\r\nmorning after breakfast with Joseph Fields, Pots and his servant York.\r\nwe proceeded on tolerably well; the current stonger than yesterday we\r\nemploy the cord and oars principally tho sometimes the setting pole. in\r\nthe evening we passed a large creek about 30 yds. wide which\r\ndisembogues on the Stard. side; it discharges a bold current of water\r\nit's banks low and bed frormed of stones altogether; this stream we\r\ncalled Ordway's creek after Sergt. John Ordway. I have observed for\r\nseveral days a species of flax growing in the river bottoms the leaf\r\nstem and pericarp of which resembles the common flax cultivated in the\r\nU States. the stem rises to the hight of about 21/2 or 3 feet high; as\r\nmany as 8 or ten of which proceede from the same root. the root appears\r\nto be perennial. the bark of the stem is thick strong and appears as if\r\nit would make excellent Hax. the seed are not yet ripe but I hope to\r\nhave an opportunity of collecting some of them after they are so if it\r\nshould on experiment prove to yeald good flax and at the same time\r\nadmit of being cut without injuring the perennial root it will be a\r\nmost valuable plant, and I think there is the greatest probability that\r\nit will do so, for notwithstanding the seed have not yet arrived at\r\nmaturity it is puting up suckers or young shoots from the same root and\r\nwould seem therefore that those which are fully grown and which are in\r\nthe proper stage of vegitation to produce the best fax are not longer\r\nessencial to the preservation or support of the root. the river\r\nsomewhat wider than yesterday and the mountains more distant from the\r\nriver and not so high; the bottoms are but narrow and little or no\r\ntimber near the river. some pine on the mountains which seems\r\nprincipally confined to their uper region. we killed one Elk this\r\nmorning and found part of the flesh and the skin of a deer this evening\r\nwhich had been kited and left by Capt. Clark. we saw several herds of\r\nthe Bighorn but they were all out of our reach on inacessable clifts.-\r\nwe encamped on the Lard. side in a small grove of narrow leafed\r\ncottonwood there is not any of the broad leafed cottonwood on the river\r\nsince it has entered the mountains. Capt Clark ascended the river on\r\nthe Stard. side. in the early part of the day after he left me the\r\nhills were so steep that he gained but little off us; in the evening he\r\npassed over a mountain by which means he cut off many miles of the\r\nriver's circuitous rout; the Indian road which he pursued over this\r\nmountain is wide and appears as if it had been cut down or dug in many\r\nplaces; he passed two streams of water, the branches of Ordway's creek,\r\non which he saw a number of beaver dams succeeding each other in close\r\norder and extending as far up those streams as he could discover them\r\nin their couse towards the mountains. he also saw many bighorn anamals\r\non the clifts of the mountains. not far beyond the mountain which he\r\npassed in the evening he encamped on a small stream of runing water.\r\nhaving travelled about 20 m. the water of those rivulets which make\r\ndown from these mountains is extreemly cold pure and fine. the soil\r\nnear the river is of a good quality and produces a luxuriant growth of\r\ngrass and weeds; among the last the sunflower holds a distinguished\r\nplace. the aspin is small but grows very commonly on the river and\r\nsmall streams which make down from the Mouts.\r\n\r\nI also observed another species of flax today which is not so large as\r\nthe first, sildome obtaining a greater hight than 9 Inches or a foot\r\nthe stem and leaf resemble the other species but the stem is rarely\r\nbranched, bearing a single monopetallous bellshaped blue flower which\r\nis suspended with it's limb downwards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 18, 1805]\r\nJuly 18th Tursday 1805\r\na fine morning passed a Considerable river which falls in on the Stard\r\nSide and nearly as wide as the Missouri we call Dearbournes river after\r\nthe Sety. of war. we thought it prudent for a partey to go a head for\r\nfear our fireing Should allarm the Indians and cause them to leave the\r\nriver and take to the mountains for Safty from their enemes who visit\r\nthem thro this rout.

I\r\nwalked along shore today and killed an Antelope. whever we get a view\r\nof the lofty summits of the mountains the snow presents itself, altho\r\nwe are almost suffocated in this confined vally with heat. the pine\r\ncedar and balsum fir grow on the mountains in irregular assemleages or\r\nspots mostly high up on their sides and summits. this evening we\r\nentered much the most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen. these\r\nclifts rise from the waters edge on either side perpendicularly to the\r\nhight of 1200 feet. every object here wears a dark and gloomy aspect.\r\nthe towering and projecting rocks in many places seem ready to tumble\r\non us. the river appears to have forced it's way through this immence\r\nbody of solid rock for the distance of 53/4 miles and where it makes\r\nit's exit below has thown on either side vast collumns of rocks\r\nmountains high. the river appears to have woarn a passage just the\r\nwidth of it's channel or 150 yds. it is deep from side to side nor is\r\nther in the 1st 3 miles of this distance a spot except one of a few\r\nyards in extent on which a man could rest the soal of his foot. several\r\nfine springs burst out at the waters edge from the interstices of the\r\nrocks. it happens fortunately that altho the current is strong it is\r\nnot so much so but what it may be overcome with the oars for there is\r\nhear no possibility of using either the cord or Setting pole. it was\r\nlate in the evening before I entered this place and was obliged to\r\ncontinue my rout untill sometime after dark before I found a place\r\nsufficiently large to encamp my small party; at length such an one\r\noccurred on the lard. side where we found plenty of lightwood and\r\npichpine. this rock is a black grannite below and appears to be of a\r\nmuch lighter colour above and from the fragments I take it to be flint\r\nof a yelloish brown and light creemcolourd yellow.--from the singular\r\nappearance of this place I called it the gates of the rocky mountains.\r\nthe mountains higher today than yesterday, saw some Bighorns and a few\r\nAntelopes also beaver and Otter; the latter are now very plenty one of\r\nthe men killed one of them today with a setting pole. musquetoes less\r\ntroublesome than usual. we had a thundershower today about 1 P.M. which\r\ncontinued about an hour and was attended with som hail. we have seen no\r\nbuffaloe since we entered the mounts. this morning early Capt. Clark\r\npursued his rout, saw early in the day the remains of several Indians\r\ncamps formed of willow brush which appeared to have been inhabited some\r\ntime this spring. saw where the natives had pealed the bark off the\r\npine trees about this same season. this the indian woman with us\r\ninforms that they do to obtain the sap and soft part of the wood and\r\nbark for food. at 11 A.M. Capt. C. feell in with a gang of Elk of which\r\nhe killed 2. and not being able to obtain as much wood as would make a\r\nfire substituded the dung of the buffaloe and cooked a part of their\r\nmeat on which they breakfasted and again pursueed their rout, which lay\r\nalong an old indian road. this evening they passed a hansome valley\r\nwatered by a large creek which extends itself with it's valley into the\r\nmountain to a considerable distance. the latter part of the evening\r\ntheir rout lay over a hilly and mountanous country covered with the\r\nsharp fragments of flint which cut and bruised their feet excessively;\r\nnor wer the prickly pear of the leveler part of the rout much less\r\npainfull; they have now become so abundant in the open uplands that it\r\nis impossible to avoid them and their thorns are so keen and stif that\r\nthey pearce a double thickness of dressed deers skin with ease. Capt.\r\nC. informed me that he extracted 17 of these bryers from his feet this\r\nevening after he encamped by the light of the fire. I have guarded or\r\nreather fortifyed my feet against them by soaling my mockersons with\r\nthe hide of the buffaloe in parchment. he encamped on the river much\r\nfortiegud having passed two mountains in the course of the day and\r\ntravelled about 30 miles.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 19, 1805]\r\nJuly 19th Fryday 1805\r\na find morning I proceeded on in an Indian path river verry crooked\r\npassed over two mountains Saw Several Indian Camps which they have left\r\nthis Spring. Saw trees Peeled & found poles &c. at 11 oC I Saw a gange\r\nof Elk as we had no provision Concluded to kill Some Killd two and\r\ndined being oblige to Substitute dry buffalow dung in place of wood,\r\nthis evening passed over a Cream Coloured flint which roled down from\r\nthe Clifts into the bottoms, the Clifts Contain flint a dark grey Stone\r\n& a redish brown intermixed and no one Clift is Solid rock, all the\r\nrocks of everry description is in Small pices appears to have been\r\nbroken by Some Convulsion--passed a butifull Creek on the Std. Side\r\nthis eveng which meanders thro a butifull Vallie of great extent, I\r\ncall after Sgt Pryor the countrey on the Lard Side a high mountain Saw\r\nSeveral Small rapids to day the river Keep its width and appear to be\r\ndeep, my feet is verry much brused & cut walking over the flint, &\r\nconstantly Stuck full Prickley pear thorns, I puled out 17 by the light\r\nof the fire to night We camped on the river Same (Lard) Side Musqutors\r\nverry troublesom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 20, 1805]\r\nSaturday 20 h 1805.\r\nSet out early this morning as usual, currant strong, we therefore\r\nemploy the toe rope when ever the banks permit the use of it; the water\r\nis reather deep for the seting pole in most places. at 6 A.M. the hills\r\nretreated from the river and the valley became wider than we have seen\r\nit since we entered the mountains. some scattering timber on the river\r\nand in the valley. consisting of the narrowleafed Cottonwood aspin &\r\npine. vas numbers of the several species of currants goosberries and\r\nservice berries; of each of these I preserved some seeds. I found a\r\nblack currant which I thought preferable in flavor to the yellow. this\r\ncurrant is really a charming fruit and I am confident would be prefered\r\nat our markets to any currant now cultivated in the U States. we killed\r\nan Elk this morning which was very acceptable to us. through the valley\r\nwhich we entered early in the morning a large creek flows from the\r\nmountains and discharges itself into the river behind an island on\r\nStard. side about 15 yds. wide this we called Potts's Creek after John\r\nPotts one of our party. about 10 A.M. we saw the smoke arrose as if the\r\ncountry had been set on fire up the valley of this creek about 7 ms.\r\ndistant we were at a loss to determine whether it had been set on fire\r\nby the natives as a signall among themselves on discovering us, as is\r\ntheir custom or whether it had been set on fire by Capt. C. and party\r\naccedentally. the first however proved to be the fact, they had\r\nunperceived by us discovered Capt. Clark's party or mine, and had set\r\nthe plain on fire to allarm the more distant natives and fled\r\nthemselves further into the interior of the mountains. this evening we\r\nfound the skin of an Elk and part of the flesh of the anamal which\r\nCapt. C. had left near the river at the upper side of the valley where\r\nhe assended the mountain with a note informing me of his transactions\r\nand that he should pass the mounts which lay just above us and wate our\r\narrival at some convenient place on the river. the other elk which\r\nCapt. C. had killed we could not find. about 2 in the evening we had\r\npassed through a range of low mountains and the country bacame more\r\nopen again, tho still broken and untimbered and the bottoms not very\r\nextensive. we encamped on the Lard. side near a spring on a high bank\r\nthe prickly pears are so abundant that we could scarcely find room to\r\nlye. just above our camp the river is again closed in by the Mouts. on\r\nboth sides. I saw a black woodpecker today about the size of the lark\r\nwoodpecker as black as a crow. I indevoured to get a shoot at it but\r\ncould not. it is a distinct species of woodpecker; it has a long tail\r\nand flys a good deel like the jay bird.\r\n\r\nThis morning Capt. Clark set out early and proceeded on through a\r\nvalley leaving the river about six miles to his left; he fell in with\r\nan old Indian road which he pursued untill it struck the river about 18\r\nmiles from his camp of the last evening just above the entrance of a\r\nlarge creek which we call white paint Creek. the party were so much\r\nfortiegued with their march and their feet cut with the flint and\r\nperced with the prickly pears untill they had become so painfull that\r\nhe proceeded but little further before he determined to encamp on the\r\nriver and wait my arrival.--Capt. C. saw a smoke today up the valley of\r\nPryor's creek which was no doubt caused by the natives likewise. he\r\nleft signals or signs on his rout in order to inform the indians should\r\nthey pursue his trale that we were not their enemies, but white men and\r\ntheir friends.--cloth &c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 20, 1805]\r\nJuly 20th Satturday 1805\r\na fine morning we proceded on thro a valley leaveing the river about 6\r\nmiles to our left and fell into an Indian roade which took us to the\r\nriver above the mo. of a Creek 18 miles The Misquetors verry troublesom\r\nmy man York nearly tired out, the bottoms of my feet blistered. I\r\nobserve a Smoke rise to our right up the Valley of the last Creek about\r\n12 miles distant, The Cause of this Smoke I can't account for certainly\r\ntho think it probable that the Indians have heard the Shooting of the\r\nPartey below and Set the Praries or Valey on fire to allarm their\r\nCamps; Supposeing our party to be a war party comeing against them, I\r\nleft Signs to Shew the Indians if they Should come on our trail that we\r\nwere not their enemeys. Camped on the river, the feet of the men with\r\nme So Stuck with Prickley pear & cut with the Stones that they were\r\nScerseley able to march at a Slow gate this after noon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 21, 1805]\r\nSunday July 21st 1805.\r\nSet out early this morning and passed a bad rappid where the river\r\nenters the mountain about 1 m. from our camp of last evening the Clifts\r\nhigh and covered with fragments of broken rocks. the current strong; we\r\nemployed the toe rope principally, and also the pole as the river is\r\nnot now so deep but reather wider and much more rapid our progress was\r\ntherefore slow and laborious. we saw three swans this morning, which\r\nlike the geese have not yet recovered the feathers of the wing and\r\ncould not fly we killed two of them the third escaped by diving and\r\npassed down with the current; they had no young ones with them\r\ntherefore presume they do not breed in this country these are the first\r\nwe have seen on the river for a great distance. we daily see great\r\nnumbers of gees with their young which are perfectly feathered except\r\nthe wings which are deficient in both young and old. my dog caught\r\nseveral today, as he frequently dose. the young ones are very fine, but\r\nthe old gees are poor and unfit for uce. saw several of the large brown\r\nor sandhill Crain today with their young. the young Crain is as large\r\nas a turkey and cannot fly they are of a bright red bey colour or that\r\nof the common deer at this season. this bird feeds on grass prinsipally\r\nand is found in the river bottoms. the grass near the river is lofty\r\nand green that of the hill sides and high open grounds is perfectly dry\r\nand appears to be scorched by the heat of the sun. the country was\r\nrough mountainous & much as that of yesterday untill towards evening\r\nwhen the river entered a beautifull and extensive plain country of\r\nabout 10 or 12 miles wide which extended upwards further that the eye\r\ncould reach this valley is bounded by two nearly parallel ranges of\r\nhigh mountains which have their summits partially covered with snow.\r\nbelow the snowey region pine succeeds and reaches down their sides in\r\nsome parts to the plain but much the greater portion of their surfaces\r\nis uncovered with timber and expose either a barren sterile soil\r\ncovered with dry parched grass or black and rugged rocks. the river\r\nimmediately on entering this valley assumes a different aspect and\r\ncharacter, it spreads to a mile and upwards in width crouded with\r\nIslands, some of them large, is shallow enough for the use of the\r\nseting pole in almost every part and still more rappid than before;\r\nit's bottom is smooth stones and some large rocks as it has been since\r\nwe have entered the mountains. the grass in these extensive bottoms is\r\ngreen and fine, about 18 inches or 2 feet high. the land is a black\r\nrich loam and appears very fertile. we encamped in this beatiful valley\r\non the Lard. side the party complain of being much fatiegued with this\r\ndays travel. we killed one deer today.--This morning we passed a bold\r\ncreek 28 yds. wide which falls in on Stard. side. it has a handsome and\r\nan extensive valley. this we called Pryor's Creek after Sergt. (John)\r\nPryor one of our party. I also saw two fesants today of a dark brown\r\ncolour much larger than the phesant of the U States.\r\n\r\nthis morning Capt. Clark having determined to hunt and wait my arrival\r\nsomewhere about his preset station was fearfull that some indians might\r\nstill be on the river above him sufficiently near to hear the report of\r\nhis guns and therefore proceeded up, the river about three miles and\r\nnot finding any indians nor discovering any fresh appearance of them\r\nreturned about four miles below and fixed his camp near the river;\r\nafter refreshing themselves with a few hours rest they set out in\r\ndifferent directions to hunt. Capt C. killed a buck and Fields a buck\r\nand doe. he caught a young curlooe which was nearly feathered. the\r\nmusquetoes were equally as troublesome to them as to ourselves this\r\nevening; tho some hours after dark the air becomes so cold that these\r\ninsects disappear. the men are all fortunately supplyed with musquetoe\r\nbiers otherwise it would be impossible for them to exist under the\r\nfatiegues which they daily encounter without their natural rest which\r\nthey could not obtain for those tormenting insects if divested of their\r\nbiers. timber still extreemly scant on the river but there is more in\r\nthis valley than we have seen since we entered the mountains; the\r\ncreeks which fall into the river are better supplyed with this article\r\nthan the river itself.-\r\n\r\nwe saw a number of trout today since the river has become more shallow;\r\nalso caught a fish of a white colour on the belly and sides and of a\r\nbluish cast on the back which had been accedentally wounded by a\r\nsetting pole. it had a long pointed mouth which opened somewhat like\r\nthe shad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 21, 1805]\r\nJuly 21st Sunday 1805\r\na fine morning our feet So brused and Cut that I deturmined to delay\r\nfor the Canoes, & if possible kill Some meat by the time they arrived,\r\nall the Creeks which fall into the Missouri on the Std.

I killed a Buck, and J. Fields\r\nkilled a Buck and Doe this evening. Cought a young Curlough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 22, 1805]\r\nMonday July 22cd 1805.\r\nWe set out early as usual. The river being divided into such a number\r\nof channels by both large and small Island that I found it impossible\r\nto lay it down correctly following one channel only in a canoe and\r\ntherefore walked on shore took the general courses of the river and\r\nfrom the rising grounds took a view of the Islands and it's different\r\nchannels which I laid don in conformity thereto on my chart. there\r\nbeing but little timber to obstruct my view I could see it's various\r\nmeanders very satisfactorily. I passed though a large Island which I\r\nfound a beautifull level and fertile plain about 10 feet above the\r\nsurface of the water and never overflown. on this Island I met with\r\ngreat quantities of a smal onion about the size of a musquit ball and\r\nsome even larger; they were white crisp and well flavored I geathered\r\nabout half a bushel of them before the canoes arrived. I halted the\r\nparty for breakfast and the men also geathered considerable quantities\r\nof those onions. it's seed had just arrived to maturity and I gathered\r\na good quantity of it. This appears to be a valuable plant inasmuch as\r\nit produces a large quantity to the squar foot and bears with ease the\r\nrigor of this climate, and withall I think it as pleasantly flavored as\r\nany species of that root I ever tasted. I called this beatifull and\r\nfertile island after this plant Onion Island. here I passed over to the\r\nstard. shore where the country was higher and ascended the river to the\r\nentrance of a large creek which discharges itself into the Missouri on\r\nthe Stard. side. it is composed of three pretty considerable creeks\r\nwhich unite in a beautifull and extensive vally a few miles before it\r\ndischarges itself into the river. while wateing for the canoes to\r\narrive I killed an otter which sunk to the bottom on being shot, a\r\ncircumstance unusual with that anamal. the water was about 8 feet deep\r\nyet so clear that I could see it at the bottom; I swam in and obtained\r\nit by diving. I halted the party here for dinner; the canoes had taken\r\ndifferent channels through these islands and it was sometime before\r\nthey all came up. I placed my thermometer in a good shade as was my\r\ncustom about 4 P.M. and after dinner set out without it and had\r\nproceeded near a mile before I recollected it I sent Sergt. Ordway back\r\nfor it, he found it and brought it on. the murcury stood at 80 a. 0\r\nthis is the warmest day except one which we have experienced this\r\nsummer. The Indian woman recognizes the country and assures us that\r\nthis is the river on which her relations live, and that the three forks\r\nare at no great distance. this peice of information has cheered the\r\nsperits of the party who now begin to console themselves with the\r\nanticipation of shortly seeing the head of the missouri yet unknown to\r\nthe civilized world. the large creek which we passed on Stard. 15 yds.\r\nwe call white Earth Creek from the circumstance of the natives\r\nprocuring a white paint on this crek.--Saw many gees, crams, and small\r\nbirds common to the plains, also a few phesants and a species of small\r\ncurlooe or plover of a brown colour which I first met with near the\r\nentrance of Smith's river but they are so shy and watchfull there is no\r\npossibility of geting a shoot at them it is a different kind from any\r\nheretofore discribed and is about the size of the yellow leged plover\r\nor jack Curlooe. both species of the willow that of the broad leaf and\r\nnarrow leaf still continue, the sweet willow is very scarce. the rose\r\nbush, small honesuckle, the pulpy leafed thorn, southernwood, sage Box\r\nalder narrow leafed cottonwood, red wod, a species of sumac are all\r\nfound in abundance as well as the red and black goosberries, service\r\nberries, choke cherries and the currants of four distinct colours of\r\nblack, yellow, red and perple. the cherries are not yet ripe. the bear\r\nappear to feed much on the currants. late this evening we arrived at\r\nCapt. Carks camp on the stard. side of the river; we took them on board\r\nwith the meat they had collected and proceeded a short distance and\r\nencamped on an Island Capt. Clark's party had killed a deer and an Elk\r\ntoday and ourselves one deer and an Antelope only. altho Capt C. was\r\nmuch fatiegued his feet yet blistered and soar he insisted on pursuing\r\nhis rout in the morning nor weould he consent willingly to my releiving\r\nhim at that time by taking a tour of the same kind. finding him anxious\r\nI readily consented to remain with the canoes; he ordered Frazier and\r\nJo. & Reubin Filds to hold themselves in readiness to accompany him in\r\nthe morning. Sharbono was anxious to accompany him and was accordingly\r\npermitted. the musquetoes and knats more than usually troublesome to us\r\nthis evening.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 22, 1805]\r\nJuly 22d Monday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the S.

A M. we came up with Drewyer who had seperated from us yesterday\r\nevening and lay out all night not being able to find where we had\r\nencamped. he had killed 5 deer which we took on board and continued our\r\nrout. the river is still divided by a great number of islands, it\r\nchannels sometimes seperating to the distance of 3 miles; the current\r\nvery rapid with a number of riffles; the bed gravel and smooth stones;\r\nthe banks low and of rich loam in the bottoms; some low bluffs of\r\nyellow and red clay with a hard red slate stone intermixed. the bottoms\r\nare wide and but scantily timbered; the underbrush very thick\r\nconsisting of the narrow & broad leafed willow rose and Currant bushes\r\nprincipally. high plains succeeds the river bottoms and extend back on\r\neither side to the base of the mountains which are from 8 to 12 miles\r\nassunder, high, rocky, some small pine and Cedar on them and ly\r\nparallel with the river. passed a large creek on Lard. side 20 yds.\r\nwide which after meandering through a beautifull and extensive bottom\r\nfor several miles nearly parallel with the river discharges itself\r\nopposite to a large cluster of islands which from their number I called\r\nthe 10 islands and the creek Whitehous's Creek, after Josph. Whitehouse\r\none of the party. saw a great abundance of the common thistles; also a\r\nnumber of the wild onions of which we collected a further supply. there\r\nis a species of garlic also which grows on the high lands with a flat\r\nleaf now green and in bloe but is strong tough and disagreeable. found\r\nsome seed of the wild flax ripe which I preserved; this plant grows in\r\ngreat abundance in these bottoms. I halted rearther early for dinner\r\ntoday than usual in order to dry some articles which had gotten wet in\r\nseveral of the canoes. I ordered the canoes to hoist their small flags\r\nin order that should the indians see us they might discover that we\r\nwere not Indians, nor their enemies. we made great uce of our seting\r\npoles and cords the uce of both which the river and banks favored. most\r\nof our small sockets were lost, and the stones were so smooth that the\r\npoints of their poles sliped in such manner that it increased the\r\nlabour of navigating the canoes very considerably, I recollected a\r\nparsel of giggs which I had brought on, and made the men each atatch\r\none of these to the lower ends of their poles with strong wire, which\r\nanswered the desired purpose. we saw Antelopes Crain gees ducks beaver\r\nand Otter. we took up four deer which Capt. Clark & party had killed\r\nand left near the river. he pursued his rout untill late in the evening\r\nand encamped on the bank of the river 25 ms. above our encampment of\r\nthe last evening; he followed an old indian road which lyes along the\r\nriver on the stard side Capt. saw a number of Antelopes, and one herd\r\nof Elk. also much sign of the indians but all of ancient date.

I Set out by land at 6 miles\r\novertook G Drewyer who had killed a Deer. we killed in the Same bottom\r\n4 deer & a antelope & left them on the river bank for the Canoes\r\nproceeded on an Indian roade through a wider Vallie which the Missouri\r\nPasses about 25 miles & Camped on the bank of the river, High mountains\r\non either Side of the Vallie Containing Scattering Pine & Cedar Some\r\nSmall Cotton willow willow &c. on the Islands & bank of the river I Saw\r\nno fresh Sign of Indians to day Great number of antelopes Some Deer & a\r\nlarge Gangue of Elk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 24, 1805]\r\nWednesday July 24th 1805.\r\nSet out at sunrise; the current very strong; passed a remarkable bluff\r\nof a crimson coloured earth on Stard. intermixed with Stratas of black\r\nand brick red slate. the valley through which the river passed today is\r\nmuch as that of yesterday nor is there any difference in the appearance\r\nof the mountains, they still continue high and seem to rise in some\r\nplaces like an amphatheater one rang above another as they receede from\r\nthe river untill the most distant and lofty have their tops clad with\r\nsnow. the adjacent mountains commonly rise so high as to conceal the\r\nmore distant and lofty mountains from our view. I fear every day that\r\nwe shall meet with some considerable falls or obstruction in the river\r\nnotwithstanding the information of the Indian woman to the contrary who\r\nassures us that the river continues much as we see it. I can scarcely\r\nform an idea of a river runing to great extent through such a rough\r\nmountainous country without having it's stream intercepted by some\r\ndifficult and gangerous rappids or falls. we daily pass a great number\r\nof small rappids or riffles which decend one to or 3 feet in 150 yards\r\nbut they are rarely incommoded with fixed or standing rocks and altho\r\nstrong rappid water are nevertheless quite practicable & by no means\r\ndangerous. we saw many beaver and some otter today; the former dam up\r\nthe small channels of the river between the islands and compell the\r\nriver in these parts to make other channels; which as soon as it has\r\neffected that which was stoped by the beaver becomes dry and is filled\r\nup with mud sand gravel and drift wood. the beaver is then compelled to\r\nseek another spot for his habitation wher he again erects his dam. thus\r\nthe river in many places among the clusters of islands is constantly\r\nchanging the direction of such sluices as the beaver are capable of\r\nstoping or of 20 yds. in width. this anamal in that way I beleive to be\r\nvery instrumental in adding to the number of islands with which we find\r\nthe river crouded. we killed one deer today and found a goat or\r\nAntelope which had been left by Capt. Clark. we saw a large bear but\r\ncould not get a shoot at him. we also saw a great number of Crams &\r\nAntelopes, some gees and a few red-headed ducks the small bird of the\r\nplains and curloos still abundant. we observed a great number of snakes\r\nabout the water of a brown uniform colour, some black, and others\r\nspeckled on the abdomen and striped with black and brownish yellow on\r\nthe back and sides. the first of these is the largest being about 4\r\nfeet long, the second is of that kind mentioned yesterday, and the last\r\nis much like the garter snake of our country and about it's size. none\r\nof these species are poisonous I examined their teeth and fund them\r\ninnosent. they all appear to be fond of the water, to which they fly\r\nfor shelter immediately on being pursued.--we saw much sign of Elk but\r\nmet with none of them. from the appearance of bones and excrement of\r\nold date the buffaloe sometimes straggle into this valley; but there is\r\nno fresh sighn of them and I begin think that our harrvest of white\r\npuddings is at an end, at least untill our return to the buffaloe\r\ncountry. our trio of pests still invade and obstruct us on all\r\noccasions, these are the Musquetoes eye knats and prickley pears, equal\r\nto any three curses that ever poor Egypt laiboured under, except the\r\nMahometant yoke. the men complain of being much fortiegued, their\r\nlabour is excessively great. I occasionly encourage them by assisting\r\nin the labour of navigating the canoes, and have learned to push a\r\ntolerable good pole in their fraize. This morning Capt. Clark set out\r\nearly and pursued the Indian road whih took him up a creek some miles\r\nabot 10 A.M. he discovered a horse about six miles distant on his left,\r\nhe changed his rout towards the horse, on approaching him he found the\r\nhorse in fine order but so wild he could not get within less than\r\nseveral hundred paces of him. he still saw much indian sign but none of\r\nrecent date. from this horse he directed his course obliquely to the\r\nriver where on his arrival he killed a deer and dined. in this wide\r\nvalley where he met with the horse he passed five handsome streams, one\r\nof which only had timber another some willows and much stoped by the\r\nbeaver. after dinner he continued his rout along the river upwards and\r\nencamped having traveled about 30 mes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 24, 1805]\r\nJuly 24th Wednesday 1805\r\na fine day wind from the N W. I proceeded on up a Creek on the\r\ndirection of the Indian road at 10 oClock discovered a horse 6 miles to\r\nmy left towards the river as I approached the horse found him fat and\r\nverry wild we could not get near him, we changed our Direction to the\r\nriver for water haveing previously Crossed 5 handsom Streams in one\r\nVallie one only had any timber on it one other Willows only & a number\r\nof beaver Dams. when I Struck the river turned down to kill a Deer\r\nwhich we dined on & proceeded on up the river a fiew miles an Campd. on\r\nthe river. the river much like it was yesterday. the mountains on\r\neither Side appear like the hills had fallen half down & turned Side\r\nupwards the bottoms narrow and no timber a fiew bushes only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 25, 1805]\r\nThursday July 25th 1805.\r\nSet out at an early hour and proceeded on tolerably well the water\r\nstill strong and some riffles as yesterday. the country continues much\r\nthe same as the two preceeding days. in the forenoon we saw a large\r\nbrown bear on an island but he retreated immediately to the main shore\r\nand ran off before we could get in reach of him. they appear to be more\r\nshy here than on the Missouri below the mountains. we saw some\r\nantelopes of which we killed one. these anamals appear now to have\r\ncollected again is small herds several females with their young and one\r\nor two males compose the herd usually. some males are yet soletary or\r\ntwo perhaps together scattered over the plains which they seen\r\ninvariably to prefer to the woodlands. if they happen accedentaly in\r\nthe woodlands and are allarmed they run immediately to the plains,\r\nseeming to plaise a just confidence in their superior fleetness and\r\nbottom. we killed a couple of young gees which are very abundant and\r\nfine; but as they are but small game to subsist a party on of our\r\nstrength I have forbid the men shooting at them as it waists a\r\nconsiderable quantity of amunition and delays our progress. we passed\r\nCapt. Clark's encampment of the 23rd inst. the face of the country &\r\nanamal and vegatable productions were the same as yesterday, untill\r\nlate in the evening, when the valley appeared to termineate and the\r\nriver was again hemned in on both sides with high caiggy and rocky\r\nclifts. soon after entering these hills or low mountains we passed a\r\nnumber of fine bold springs which burst out underneath the Lard. clifts\r\nnear the edge of the water; they wer very cold and freestone water. we\r\npassed a large Crk. today in the plain country, 25 yds. wide, which\r\ndischarges itself on the Stard. side; it is composed of five streams\r\nwhich unite in the plain at no great distance from the river and have\r\ntheir souces in the Mts. this stream we called Gass's Creek. after\r\nSergt. Patric Gass one of our party.--two rapids near the large spring\r\nwe passed this evening were the worst we have seen since that we passed\r\non entering the rocky Mountain; they were obstructed with sharp pointed\r\nrocks, ranges of which extended quite across the river. the clifts are\r\nformed of a lighter coloured stone than those below I obseve some\r\nlimestone also in the bed of the river which seem to have been brought\r\ndown by the current as they are generally small and woarn smooth.--This\r\nmorning Capt. Clark set out early and at the distance of a few miles\r\narrived at the three forks of the Missouri, here he found the plains\r\nrecently birnt on the stard. side, and the track of a horse which\r\nappeared to have passed only about four or five days. after taking\r\nbreakfast of some meat which they had brought with them, examined the\r\nrivers, and written me a note informing me of his intended rout, he\r\ncontinued on up the North fork, which though not larger than the middle\r\nfork, boar more to the West, and of course more in the direction we\r\nwere anxious to pursue. he ascended this stream about 25 miles on\r\nStard. side, and encamped, much fatiegued, his feet blistered and\r\nwounded with the prickley pear thorns. Charbono gave out, one of his\r\nankles failed him and he was unable to proceede any further.--I\r\nobserved that the rocks which form the clifts on this part of the river\r\nappear as if they had been undermined by the river and by their weight\r\nhad seperated from the parent hill and tumbled on their sides, the\r\nstratas of rock of which they are composed lying with their edges up;\r\nothers not seperated seem obliquely depressed on the side next the\r\nriver as if they had sunk down to fill the cavity which had been formed\r\nby the washing and wearing of the river. I have observed a red as well\r\nas a yellow species of goosberry which grows on the rocky Clifts in\r\nopen places of a swetish pine like flavor, first observed in the\r\nneighbourhood of the falls; at least the yellow species was first\r\nobserved there. the red differs from it in no particular except it's\r\ncolour and size being somewhat larger; it is a very indifferent fruit,\r\nbut as they form a variety of the native fruits of this country I\r\npreserved some of their seeds. musquetoes and knats troublesome as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 25, 1805]\r\nJuly 25th Thursday 1805\r\na fine morning we proceeded on a fiew miles to the three forks of the\r\nMissouri those three forks are nearly of a Size, the North fork appears\r\nto have the most water and must be Considered as the one best\r\ncalculated for us to assend middle fork is quit as large about 90 yds.\r\nwide. The South fork is about 70 yds wide & falls in about 400 yards\r\nbelow the midle fork. those forks appear to be verry rapid & Contain\r\nSome timber in their bottoms which is verry extincive,--on the North\r\nSide the Indians have latterly Set the Praries on fire, the Cause I\r\ncan't account for. I Saw one horse track going up the river about four\r\nor 5 days past. after Brackfast (which we made on the ribs of a Buck\r\nkilled yesterday), I wrote a note informing Capt Lewis the rout I\r\nintended to take, and proeeded on up the main North fork thro a vallie,\r\nthe day verry hot about 6 or 8 miles up the North fork a Small rapid\r\nriver falls in on the Lard Side which affords a great Deel of water and\r\nappears to head in the Snow mountains to the S W. this little river\r\nfalls into the Missouri by three mouthes, haveing Seperated after it\r\narrives in the river Bottoms, and Contains as also all the water\r\ncourses in this quarter emence number of Beaver & orter maney thousand\r\nenhabit the river & Creeks near the 3 forks (Pholosiphie's River)--We\r\nCampd on the Same Side we assended Starboard 20 miles on a direct line\r\nup the N. fork. Shabono our intrepreter nearly tired one of his ankles\r\nfalling him--The bottoms are extencive and tolerable land Covered with\r\ntall grass & prickley pears The hills & mountains are high Steep &\r\nrockey. The river verry much divided by Islands Some Elk Bear & Deer\r\nand Some Small timber on the Islands. Great quantities of Currents,\r\nred, black, yellow, Purple, also Mountain Currents which grow on the\r\nSides of Clifts; inferior in taste to the others haveing Sweet pineish\r\nflaver and are red & yellow, Choke Cheries, Boin roche, and the red\r\nburies also abound--musquitors verry trouble Som untill the mountain\r\nbreeze Sprung up which was a little after night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 26, 1805]\r\nFriday July 26th 1805.\r\nSet out early this morning as usual current strong with frequent\r\nriffles; employ the cord and seting poles. the oars scarcely ever being\r\nused except to pass the river in order to take advantage of the shore\r\nand cur-rent. at the distance of 33/4 m. passed the entrance of a large\r\nCreek 15 yds. wide which discharges itself on Lard. near the center of\r\na Lard. bend it is a bold runing stream this we called Howard's Creek\r\nafter Thomas P. Howard one of our party. at the distance of one mile\r\nfurther we passed the entrance of a small run which falls in just above\r\na rocky clift on Lard. here the hills or reather mountains again recede\r\nfrom the river and the valley again widens to the extent of several\r\nmiles with wide and fertile bottom lands. covered with grass and in\r\nmany places a fine terf of greenswoard. the high lands are thin meagre\r\nsoil covered with dry low sedge and a species of grass also dry the\r\nseeds of which are armed with a long twisted hard beard at the upper\r\nextremity while the lower point is a sharp subulate firm point beset at\r\nit's base with little stiff bristles standing with their points in a\r\ncontrary direction to the subulate point to which they answer as a barb\r\nand serve also to pres it forward when onece entered a small distance.\r\nthese barbed seed penetrate our mockersons and leather legings and give\r\nus great pain untill they are removed. my poor dog suffers with them\r\nexcessively, he is constantly hinting and scratching himself as if in a\r\nrack of pain. the prickly pear also grow here as abundantly as usual.\r\nthere is another species of the prickly pear of a globular form,\r\ncomposed of an assemblage of little conic leaves springing from a\r\ncommon root to which their small points are attached as a common center\r\nand the base of the cone forms the apex of the leaf which is garnished\r\nwith a circular range of sharp thorns quite as stif and more keen than\r\nthe more common species with the flat leaf, like the Cockeneal plant.\r\non entering this open valley I saw the snowclad tops of distant\r\nmountains before us. the timber and mountains much as heretofore. saw a\r\nnumber of beaver today and some otter, killed one of the former, also 4\r\ndeer; found a deer's skin which had been left by Capt. C. with a note\r\ninforming me of his having met with a horse but had seen no fresh\r\nappearance of the Indians. the river in the valley is from 2 to 250\r\nyds. wide and crouded with Islands, in some places it is 3/4 of a mile\r\nwide including islands. were it passed the hills it was from 150 to 200\r\nyds. the banks are still low but never overflow. one of the men brought\r\nme an indian bow which he found, it was made of cedar and about 2 F. 9\r\nInh. in length. it had nothing remarkable in it's form being much such\r\nas is used by the Mandans Minetares &c. This morning Capt. Clark left\r\nSharbono and Joseph Fields at the camp of last evening and proceeded up\r\nthe river about 12 miles to the top of a mountain from whence he had an\r\nextensive view of the valley of the river upwards and of a large creek\r\nwhich flowed into it on Std. side. not meeting with any fresh\r\nappearance of Indians he determined to return and examine the middle\r\nfork of the missouri and meet me by the time he expected me to arrive\r\nat the forks. he returned down the mountain by the way of an old Indian\r\nroad which led through a deep hollow of the mountain facing the south\r\nthe day being warm and the road unshaded by timber he suffered\r\nexcessively with heat and the want of water, at length he arrived at a\r\nvery cold spring, at which he took the precaution of weting his feet\r\nhead and hands before drank but notwithstanding this precaution he soon\r\nfelt the effects of the water. he felt himself very unwell shortly\r\nafter but continued his march rejoined Sharbono and Fields where the\r\nparty eat of a fawn which Jo. Fields had killed in their absence Capt.\r\nC. was so unwell that he had no inclination to eat. after a short\r\nrespite he resumed his march pass the North fork at a large island;\r\nhere Charbono was very near being swept away by the current and cannot\r\nswim, Capt. C however risqued him and saved his life. Capt. C.\r\ncontinued his march to a small river which falls into the North fork\r\nsome miles above the junction of the 3 forks it being the distance of\r\nabout four miles from his camp of last evening here finding himself\r\nstill more unwell he determined to encamp. they killed two brown or\r\nGrisley bear this evening on the island where they passed the N. fork\r\nof the Missouri. this stream is much divided by islands and it's\r\ncurrent rapid and much as that of the missouri where we are and is\r\nnavigable.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 26, 1805]\r\nJuly 26th Friday 1805\r\nI deturmined to leave Shabono & one man who had Sore feet to rest &\r\nproceed on with the other two to the top of a mountain 12 miles distant\r\nwest and from thence view the river & vallies a head, we with great\r\ndificuelty & much fatigue reached the top at 11 oClock from the top of\r\nthis mountain I could see the Course of the North fork about 10 miles\r\nmeandering through a Vallie but Could discover no Indians or Sign which\r\nwas fresh. I could also See Some distance up the Small River below, and\r\nalso the middle fork after Satisfying my Self returned to the two men\r\nby an old Indian parth, on this parth & in the Mountain we Came to a\r\nSpring of excessive Cold water, which we drank reather freely of as we\r\nwere almost famished; not with Standing the precautions of wetting my\r\nface, hands, & feet, I Soon felt the effects of the water. We Contind.\r\nthro a Deep Vallie without a Tree to Shade us Scorching with heat to\r\nthe men who had killed a pore Deer, I was fatigued my feet with Several\r\nblisters & Stuck with prickley pears. I eate but verry little\r\ndeturmined to Cross to the middle fork and examine that. we Crossed the\r\nMissouri which was divided by a verry large Island, the first Part was\r\nknee deep, the other waste deep & verry rapid--I felt my Self verry\r\nunwell & took up Camp on the little river 3 miles above its mouth &\r\nnear the place it falls into the bottom a fiew Drops of rain this\r\nevening\r\n\r\nwe killed 2 bear which was imediately in our way. both pore emence\r\nnumber of Beaver and orter in this little river which forks in the\r\nbottom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 27, 1805]\r\nSaturday July 27th 1805.\r\nWe set out at an early hour and proceeded on but slowly the current\r\nstill so rapid that the men are in a continual state of their utmost\r\nexertion to get on, and they begin to weaken fast from this continual\r\nstate of violent exertion. at the distance of 13/4 miles the river was\r\nagain closely hemned in by high Clifts of a solid limestone rock which\r\nappear to have tumbled or sunk in the same manner of those discribed\r\nyesterday. the limestone appears to be of an excellent quality of deep\r\nblue colour when fractured and of a light led colour where exposed to\r\nthe weather. it appears to be of a very fine grain the fracture like\r\nthat of marble. we saw a great number of the bighorn on those Clifts.\r\nat the distance of 33/4 ms. further we arrived at 9 A.M. at the\r\njunction of the S. E. fork of the Missouri and the country opens\r\nsuddonly to extensive and beatifull plains and meadows which appear to\r\nbe surrounded in every direction with distant and lofty mountains;\r\nsupposing this to be the three forks of the Missouri I halted the party\r\non the Lard. shore for breakfast and walked up the S. E. fork about 1/2\r\na mile and ascended the point of a high limestone clift from whence I\r\ncommanded a most perfect view of the neighbouring country. From this\r\npoint I could see the S. E. fork about 7 miles. it is rapid and about\r\n70 yards wide. throughout the distance I saw it, it passes through a\r\nsmoth extensive green meadow of fine grass in it's course meandering in\r\nseveral streams the largest of which passes near the Lard. hills, of\r\nwhich, the one I stand on is the extremity in this direction. a high\r\nwide and extensive plain succeeds the meadow and extends back several\r\nmiles from the river on the Stard. sade and with the range of mountains\r\nup the Lard. side of the middle fork. a large spring arrises in this\r\nmeadow about 1/4 of a mile from the S. E. fork into which it discharges\r\nitself on the Stard. side about 400 paces above me. from E to S.\r\nbetween the S. E. and middle forks a distant range of lofty mountains\r\nrose their snow-clad tops above the irregular and broken mountains\r\nwhich lie adjacent to this beautifull spot. the extreme point to which\r\nI could see the S. E. fork boar S. 65° E. distant 7 ms. as before\r\nobserved. between the middle and S. E. forks near their junctions with\r\nthe S. W. fork there is a handsom site for a fortification it consists\r\nof a limestone rock of an oblong form; it's sides perpendicular and\r\nabout 25 ft high except at the extremity towards the middle fork where\r\nit ascends gradually and like the top is covered with a fine terf of\r\ngreenswoard. the top is level and contains about 2 Acres. the rock\r\nrises from the level plain as if it had been designed for some such\r\npurpose. the extream point to which I can see the bottom and meandering\r\nof the Middle fork bears S. 15 E distant about 14 miles. here it turns\r\nto the right around a point of a high plain and disappears to my view.\r\nit's bottoms are several miles in width and like that of the S. E. fork\r\nform one smoth and beautifull green meadow. it is also divided into\r\nseveral streams. betwen this and the S. W. fork there is an extensive\r\nplain which appears to extend up both those rivers many miles and back\r\nto the mountains. the extreme point to which I can see the S. W. fork\r\nbears S. 30 W. distant about 12 miles. this stream passes through a\r\nsimilar country with the other two and is more divided and serpentine\r\nin it's course than either of the others; it also possesses abundanly\r\nmore timber in it's bottoms. the timber here consists of the\r\nnarrowleafed cottonwood almost entirely. but little box alder or sweet\r\nwillow the underbrush thick and as heretofore discribed in the quarter\r\nof the missouri. a range of high mountains at a considerable distance\r\nappear to reach from South to West and are partially covered with snow\r\nthe country to the right of the S. W. fork like that to the left of the\r\nS. E. fork is high broken and mountainous as is that also down the\r\nmissouri behind us, through which, these three rivers after assembling\r\ntheir united force at this point seem to have forced a passage these\r\nbottom lands tho not more than 8 or 9 feet above the water seem never\r\nto overflow. after making a draught of the connection and meanders of\r\nthese streams I decended the hill and returned to the party, took\r\nbreakfast and ascended the S. W. fork 13/4 miles and encamped at a\r\nLard. bend in a handsome level smooth plain just below a bayou, having\r\npassed the entrance of the middle fork at 1/2 a mile. here I encamped\r\nto wait the return of Capt. Clark and to give the men a little rest\r\nwhich seemed absolutely necessary to them. at the junction of the S. W.\r\nand Middle forks I found a note which had been left by Capt. Clark\r\ninforming me of his intended rout, and that he would rejoin me at this\r\nplace provided he did not fall in with any fresh sighn of Indians, in\r\nwhich case he intended to pursue untill he over took them calculating\r\non my taking the S. W. fork, which I most certainly prefer as it's\r\ndirection is much more promising than any other. beleiving this to be\r\nan essential point in the geography of this western part of the\r\nContinent I determined to remain at all events untill I obtained the\r\nnecessary data for fixing it's latitude Longitude &c. after fixing my\r\ncamp I had the canoes all unloaded and the baggage stoed away and\r\nsecurely covered on shore, and then permitted several men to hunt. I\r\nwalked down to the middle fork and examined and compared it with the S.\r\nW. fork but could not satisfy myself which was the largest stream of\r\nthe two, in fact they appeared as if they had been cast in the same\r\nmould there being no difference in character or size, therefore to call\r\neither of these streams the Missouri would be giving it a preference\r\nwich it's size dose not warrant as it is not larger then the other.\r\nthey are each 90 yds. wide. in these meadows I saw a number of the\r\nduckanmallad with their young which are now nearly grown. Currants of\r\nevery species as well as goosberries are found here in great abundance\r\nand perfection. a large black goosberry which grows to the hight of\r\nfive or six feet is also found here. this is the growth of the bottom\r\nlands and is found also near the little rivulets which make down from\r\nthe hills and mountains it puts up many stems from the same root, some\r\nof which are partialy branched and all reclining. the berry is\r\nattatched seperately by a long peduncle to the stem from which they\r\nhang pendant underneath. the berry is of an ovate form smooth as large\r\nas the common garden goosberry when arrived at maturity and is as black\r\nas jet, tho the pulp is of a cimson colour. this fruit is extreemly\r\nasced. the leaf resembles the common goosberry in form but is reather\r\nlarger and somewhat proportioned to the superior size of it's stem when\r\ncompared with the common goosberry. the stem is covered with very sharp\r\nthorns or bryers. below the tree forks as we passed this morning I\r\nobserved many collections of the mud nests of the small martin\r\nattatched to the smooth face of the limestone rocks sheltered by\r\nprojections of the same rock above. Our hunters returned this evening\r\nwith 6 deer 3 Otter and a musk rat. they informed me that they had seen\r\ngreat numbers of Antelopes, and much sign of beaver Otter deer Elk, &c.\r\nat 3 P.M. Capt Clark arrived very sick with a high fever on him and\r\nmuch fatiegued and exhausted. he informed me that he was very sick all\r\nlast night had a high fever and frequent chills & constant aking pains\r\nin all his mustles. this morning notwithstanding his indisposition he\r\npursued his intended rout to the middle fork about 8 miles and finding\r\nno recent sign of Indians rested about an hour and came down the middle\r\nfork to this place. Capt. C. thought himself somewhat bilious and had\r\nnot had a passage for several days; I prevailed on him to take a doze\r\nof Rushes pills, which I have always found sovereign in such cases and\r\nto bath his feet in warm water and rest himself. Capt. C's\r\nindisposition was a further inducement for my remaining here a couple\r\nof days; I therefore informed the men of my intention, and they put\r\ntheir deer skins in the water in order to prepare them for dressing\r\ntomorrow. we begin to feel considerable anxiety with rispect to the\r\nSnake Indians. if we do not find them or some other nation who have\r\nhorses I fear the successfull issue of our voyage will be very\r\ndoubtfull or at all events much more difficult in it's accomplishment.\r\nwe are now several hundred miles within the bosom of this wild and\r\nmountanous country, where game may rationally be expected shortly to\r\nbecome scarce and subsistence precarious without any information with\r\nrispect to the country not knowing how far these mountains continue, or\r\nwher to direct our course to pass them to advantage or intersept a\r\nnavigable branch of the Columbia, or even were we on such an one the\r\nprobability is that we should not find any timber within these\r\nmountains large enough for canoes if we judge from the portion of them\r\nthrough which we have passed. however I still hope for the best, and\r\nintend taking a tramp myself in a few days to find these yellow\r\ngentlemen if possible. my two principal consolations are that from our\r\npresent position it is impossible that the S. W. fork can head with the\r\nwaters of any other river but the Columbia, and that if any Indians can\r\nsubsist in the form of a nation in these mountains with the means they\r\nhave of acquiring food we can also subsist. Capt. C. informed me that\r\nthere is a part of this bottom on the West side of the Middle fork near\r\nthe plain, which appears to overflow occasionally and is stony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 27, 1805]\r\nJuly 27th Saturday 1805\r\nI was verry unwell all last night with a high fever & akeing in all my\r\nbones. my fever &c. continus, deturmind to prosue my intended rout to\r\nthe middle fork, accordingly Set out in great pain across a Prarie 8\r\nmiles to the Middle this fork is nearly as large as the North fork &\r\nappears to be more rapid, we examined and found no fresh Sign of\r\nIndians, and after resting about an hour, proceeded down to the\r\njunction thro a wide bottom which appears to be overflown every year, &\r\nmaney parts Stoney this river has Several Islands and number of beaver\r\n& orter, but little timber. we could See no fresh Sign of Indians just\r\nabove the Point I found Capt Lewis encamped haveing arrived about 2\r\noClock. Several Deer killed this evening. I continue to be verry unwell\r\nfever verry high; take 5 of rushes pills & bathe my feet & legs in hot\r\nwater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 28, 1805]\r\nSunday July 28th 1805.\r\nMy friend Capt. Clark was very sick all last night but feels himself\r\nsomwhat better this morning since his medicine has opperated. I\r\ndispatched two men early this morning up the S. E. Fork to examine the\r\nriver; and permitted sundry others to hunt in the neighbourhood of this\r\nplace. Both Capt. C. and myself corrisponded in opinon with rispect to\r\nthe impropriety of calling either of these streams the Missouri and\r\naccordingly agreed to name them after the President of the United\r\nStates and the Secretaries of the Treasury and state having previously\r\nnamed one river in honour of the Secretaries of War and Navy. In\r\npursuance of this resolution we called the S. W. fork, that which we\r\nmeant to ascend, Jefferson's River in honor of Thomas Jefferson. the\r\nMiddle fork we called Madison's River in honor of James Madison, and\r\nthe S. E. Fork we called Gallitin's River in honor of Albert Gallitin.\r\nthe two first are 90 yards wide and the last is 70 yards. all of them\r\nrun with great valocity and thow out large bodies of water. Gallitin's\r\nRiver is reather more rapid than either of the others, is not quite as\r\ndeep but from all appearances may be navigated to a considerable\r\ndistance. Capt. C. who came down Madison's river yesterday and has also\r\nseen Jefferson's some distance thinks Madison's reather the most rapid,\r\nbut it is not as much so by any means as Gallitin's. the beds of all\r\nthese streams are formed of smooth pebble and gravel, and their waters\r\nperfectly transparent; in short they are three noble streams. there is\r\ntimber enough here to support an establishment, provided it be erected\r\nwith brick or stone either of which would be much cheaper than wood as\r\nall the materials for such a work are immediately at the spot. there\r\nare several small sand-bars along the shores at no great distance of\r\nvery pure sand and the earth appears as if it would make good brick. I\r\nhad all our baggage spread out to dry this morning; and the day proving\r\nwarm, I had a small bower or booth erected for the comfort of Capt. C.\r\nour leather lodge when exposed to the sun is excessively hot. I observe\r\nlarge quantities of the sand rush in these bottoms which grow in many\r\nplaces as high as a man's breast and stand as thick as the stalks of\r\nwheat usually do. this affords one of the best winter pastures on earth\r\nfor horses or cows, and of course will be much in favour of an\r\nestablishment should it ever be thought necessary to fix one at this\r\nplace. the grass is also luxouriant and would afford a fine swarth of\r\nhay at this time in parsels of many acres together. all those who are\r\nnot hunting altho much fatiegued are busily engaged in dressing their\r\nskins, making mockersons leggings &c to make themselves comfortable.\r\nthe Musquetoes are more than usually troublesome, the knats are not as\r\nmuch so. in the evening about 4 O'Ck the wind blew hard from South West\r\nand after some little time brought on a Cloud attended with thunder and\r\nLightning from which we had a fine refreshing shower which cooled the\r\nair considerably; the showers continued with short intervals untill\r\nafter dark. in the evening the hunters all returned they had killed 8\r\ndeer and 2 Elk. some of the deer wer in excellent order. those whome I\r\nhad sent up Gallitin's river reported that after it passed the point to\r\nwhich I had seen it yesterday that it turned more to the East to a\r\nconsiderable distance or as far as they could discover the opening of\r\nthe Mountains formed by it's valley which was many miles. the bottoms\r\nwere tolerably wide but not as much so as at or near it's mouth. it's\r\ncurrent is rappid and the stream much divided with islands but is\r\nsufficiently deep for canoe navigation. Our present camp is precisely\r\non the spot that the Snake Indians were encamped at the time the\r\nMinnetares of the Knife R. first came in sight of them five years\r\nsince. from hence they retreated about three miles up Jeffersons river\r\nand concealed themselves in the woods, the Minnetares pursued, attacked\r\nthem, killed 4 men 4 women a number of boys, and mad prisoners of all\r\nthe females and four boys, Sah-cah-gar-we-ah or Indian woman was one of\r\nthe female prisoners taken at that time; tho I cannot discover that she\r\nshews any immotion of sorrow in recollecting this event, or of joy in\r\nbeing again restored to her native country; if she has enough to eat\r\nand a few trinkets to wear I beleive she would be perfectly content\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 28, 1805]\r\nJuly 28th Sunday 1805\r\nI was verry unwell all night, Something better this morning, a very\r\nworm day untill 4 oClock when the wind rose & blew hard from the S W.\r\nand was Cloudy, The Thermometr.

Capt. Clark\r\nis much better today, is perfectly clear of fever but still very\r\nlanguid and complains of a general soarness in all his limbs. I\r\nprevailed on him to take the barks which he has done and eate tolerably\r\nfreely of our good venison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 29, 1805]\r\nJuly 29 Monday 1805\r\nA fair morning wind from the North I feel my Self something better to\r\nday, made some Celestial observations took two Merdn. altitudes which\r\ngave for Latd. 45° 22' 34\" N men all dressing Skins &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 30, 1805]\r\nTuesday July 30th 1805.\r\nCapt. Clark being much better this morning and having completed my\r\nobservations we reloaded our canoes and set out, ascending Jeffersons\r\nriver. Sharbono, his woman two invalleds and myself walked through the\r\nbottom on the Lard. side of the river about 41/2 miles when we again\r\nstruck it at the place the woman informed us that she was taken\r\nprisoner. here we halted untill Capt. Clark arrived which was not\r\nuntill after one P.M. the water being strong and the river extreemly\r\ncrooked. we dined and again proceeded on; as the river now passed\r\nthrough the woods the invalleds got on board together with Sharbono and\r\nthe Indian woman; I passed the river and continued my walk on the\r\nStard. side. saw a vast number of beaver in many large dams which they\r\nhad maid in various bayoes of the river which are distributed to the\r\ndistance of three or four miles on this side of the river over an\r\nextensive bottom of timbered and meadow lands intermixed. in order to\r\navoid these bayoes and beaver dams which I found difficult to pass I\r\ndirected my course to the high plain to the right which I gained after\r\nsome time with much difficulty and waiding many beaver dams to my waist\r\nin mud and water. I would willingly have joined the canoes but the\r\nbrush were so thick, the river crooked and bottoms intercepted in such\r\nmanner by the beaver dams, that I found it uceless to attempt to find\r\nthem, and therefore proceeded on up the river in order to intersept it\r\nwhere it came near the plain and woult be more collected into one\r\nchannel. at length about sunset I arrived at the river only about six\r\nmiles from my calculation on a direct line from the place I had left\r\nthe canoes but I thought they were still below me. I found the river\r\nwas divided where I reached it by an Island and was therefore fearfull\r\nthat they might pass without my seeing them, and went down to the lower\r\npoint of the large island; here I discovered a small Island, close\r\nunder the shore on which I was; I passed the narrow channel to the\r\nsmall island and examined the gravly bar along the edge of the river\r\nfor the tracks of the men, knowing from the appearance of the river at\r\nthis place that if they had passed they would have used the cord on the\r\nside where I was. I saw no tracks and was then fully convinced that\r\nthey were below me. I fired my gun and hallooed but counld hear nothing\r\nof them. by this time it was getting nearly dark and a duck lit on the\r\nshore in about 40 steps of me and I killed it; having now secured my\r\nsupper I looked our for a suitable place to amuse myself in combating\r\nthe musquetoes for the ballance of the evening. I found a parsel of\r\ndrift wood at the head of the little Island on which I was and\r\nimmediately set it on fire and collected some willow brush to lye on. I\r\ncooked my duck which I found very good and after eating it layed down\r\nand should have had a comfortable nights lodge but for the musquetoes\r\nwhich infested me all night. late at night I was awakened by the nois\r\nof some animal runing over the stoney bar on which I lay but did not\r\nsee it; from the weight with which it ran I supposed it to be either an\r\nElk or a brown bear. the latter are very abundant in this\r\nneighbourhood. the night was cool but I felt very little inconvenience\r\nfrom it as I had a large fire all night. Capt. Clark had proceeded on\r\nafter I seperated from him and encamped on a islad. only about 2 miles\r\nbelow me but did not hear the report of my gun nor of my hooping.-I saw\r\nsome deer and antelopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 30, 1805]\r\nJuly 30th Monday 1805\r\nWe Set out 8 oClock and proceeded on 131/2 miles up the N. fork the\r\nriver verry rapid & Sholey the Channel entirely Corse gravel many\r\nIslands and a number of Chanels in different directions thro the bottom\r\n&c. passed the place the Squar interpretress was taken, one man with\r\nhis Sholder Strained, 2 with Turners, we Camped on the Std.

Capt Lewis who walkd on Shore did not join me this evening\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 31, 1805]\r\nWednesday July 31st 1805.\r\nThis morning I waited at my camp very impatiently for the arrival of\r\nCapt. Clark and party; I observed by my watch that it was 7 A.M. and\r\nthey had not come in sight. I now became very uneasy and determined to\r\nwait until 8 and if they did not arrive by that time to proceed on up\r\nthe river taking it as a fact that they had passed my camp some miles\r\nlast evening. just as I set out to pursue my plan I discovered Charbono\r\nwalking up shore some distance below me and waited untill arrived I now\r\nlearnt that the canoes were behind, they arrived shortly after. their\r\ndetention had been caused by the rapidity of the water and the\r\ncircuitous rout of the river. they halted and breakfasted after which\r\nwe all set out again and I continued my walk on the Stard. shore the\r\nriver now becomes more collected the islands tho numerous ar generally\r\nsmall. the river continues rapid and is from 90 to 120 yd. wide has a\r\nconsiderable quantity of timber in it's bottoms. towards evening the\r\nbottoms became much narrower and the timber much more scant. high hills\r\nset in close on the Lard. and the plain high waivy or reather broken on\r\nthe Stard. and approach the river closely for a shot distance vally\r\nabove 11/2 M wd. About one mile above Capt. Clark's encampment of the\r\nlast evening the principall entrance of a considerable river discharges\r\nitself into Jefferson's river. this stream is a little upwards of 30\r\nyd. wide discharges a large quantity of very clear water it's bed like\r\nthat of Jefferson's river is pebble and gravel. it takes it's rise in\r\nthe snowclad mountains between Jefferson's and Madison's Rivers to the\r\nS. W. and discharges itself into the former by seven mouths it has some\r\ntimber in it's bottoms and vas numbers of beaver and Otter. this stream\r\nwe call River Philosophy. the rock of the clifts this evening is a hard\r\nblack grannite like that of the clifts of most parts of the river below\r\nthe limestone clifts at the 3 forks of the Missouri this evening just\r\nbefore we encamped Drewyer discovered a brown bear enter a small cops\r\nof bushes on the Lard. side; we surrounded the place an surched the\r\nbrush but he had escaped in some manner unperceived but how we could\r\nnot discover. nothing killed today and our fresh meat is out. when we\r\nhave a plenty of fresh meat I find it impossible to make the men take\r\nany care of it, or use it with the least frugallity. tho I expect that\r\nnecessity will shortly teach them this art. the mountiains on both\r\nsides of the river at no great distance are very lofty. we have a lame\r\ncrew just now, two with turners or bad boils on various parts of them,\r\none with a bad stone bruise, one with his arm accedently dislocated but\r\nfortunately well replaced, and a fifth has streigned his back by\r\nsliping and falling backwards on the gunwall of the canoe. the latter\r\nis Sergt. Gass. it gives him great pain to work in the canoe in his\r\npresent situation, but he thinks he can walk with convenience, I\r\ntherefore scelected him as one of the party to accompany me tomorrow,\r\nbeing determined to go in quest of the Snake Indians. I also directed\r\nDrewyer and Charbono to hold themselves in readiness. Charbono thinks\r\nthat his ankle is sufficiently recovered to stand the march but I\r\nentertain my doubts of the fact; he is very anxious to accompany me and\r\nI therefore indulge him. There is some pine on the hills on both sides\r\nof the river opposite to our encampment which is on the Lard. side upon\r\na small island just above a run. the bull rush & Cat-tail flag grow in\r\ngreat abundance in the moist parts of the bottoms the dryer situations\r\nare covered with fine grass, tanzy, thistles, onions and flax. the\r\nbottom land fertile and of a black rich loam. the uplands poor sterile\r\nand of a light yellow clay with a mixture of small smooth pebble and\r\ngravel, poducing prickley pears, sedge and the bearded grass in great\r\nabundance; this grass is now so dry that it would birn like tinder.--we\r\nsaw one bighorn today a few antelopes and deer.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 31, 1805]\r\nJuly 31st Tuesday 1805\r\na fair Morning Capt Lewis out all night, we arrived at his Camp to\r\nbrackfast, he was without a blanket, & he killed a Duck whiche Suped on\r\n&c. the river as yesterday Sholey & rapid, passed the lower mouth of a\r\nSmall river on the Lard. in the morning & the upper mouth a ____ Miles\r\nabove, this little river is the one I camped on the 26th & heads in the\r\nSnow mountains to the S W. proceeded on verry well and Camped on a\r\nSmall Island a little above the place I Camped the 25th instant at the\r\nmouth of a run on the Lard Side, the bottoms from the Mouth of the\r\nriver extend to 21/2 Miles & enter a Short & high hill which is about 1\r\nmile thro and, the river then passes thro a 2d value of about 11/2\r\nMiles wide, Some Islands. below this Knobe the river is Crouded with\r\nIslands, we are out of fresh meet, & nothing killed to day The\r\nMountains on either Side is high & rough we have two men with toumers\r\nand unable to work.\r\n\r\nCapt Lewis deturmin to proceed on with three men in Serch of the Snake\r\nIndians, tomorrow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 1, 1805]\r\nAugust 1st 1805\r\nAt half after 8 A.M. we halted for breakfast and as had been previously\r\nagreed on between Capt. Clark and myself I set out with 3 men in quest\r\nof the Snake Indians. the men I took were the two Interpreters Drewyer\r\nand Sharbono and Sergt. Gass who by an accedental fall had so disabled\r\nhimself that it was with much pain he could work in the canoes tho he\r\ncould march with convenience. the rout we took lay over a rough high\r\nrange of mountains on the North side of the river. the rive entered\r\nthese mountains a few miles above where we left it. Capt Clark\r\nrecommended this rout to me from a belief that the river as soon as it\r\npast the mountains boar to the N. of W. he having a few days before\r\nascended these mountains to a position from which he discovered a large\r\nvalley passing betwen the mountains and which boar to the N. West. this\r\nhowever poved to be the inlet of a large creek which discharged itself\r\ninto the river just above this range of mountans, the river bearing to\r\nthe S. W. we were therefore thrown several miles out of our rout. as\r\nsoon as we discovered our mistake we directed our course to the river\r\nwhich we at length gained about 2 P.M. much exhausted by the heat of\r\nthe day the roughnes of the road and the want of water. the mountains\r\nare extreemly bare of timber and our rout lay through the steep valleys\r\nexposed to the heat of the sun without shade and scarcely a breath of\r\nair; and to add to my fatiegue in this walk of about 11 miles I had\r\ntaken a doze of glauber salts in the morning in consequence of a slight\r\ndesentary with which I had been afflicted for several days; being\r\nweakened by the disorder and the opperation of the medecine I found\r\nmyself almost exhausted before we reached the river. I felt my sperits\r\nmuch revived on our near approach to the river at the sight of a herd\r\nof Elk of which Drewyer and myself killed two. we then hurried to the\r\nriver and allayed our thirst. I ordered two of the men to skin the Elk\r\nand bring the meat to the river while myself and the other prepared a\r\nfire and cooked some of the meat for our dinner. we made a comfortable\r\nmeal of the Elk and left the ballance of the meat on the bank of the\r\nriver the party with Capt. Clark. this supply was no doubt very\r\nacceptable to them as they had had no fresh meat for near two days\r\nexcept one beaver Game being very scarce and shy. we had seen a few\r\ndeer and some goats but had not been fortunate enough to kill any of\r\nthem. after dinner we resumed our march and encamped about 6 m. above\r\non the Stard side of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 1, 1805]\r\nThursday August 1st 1805.\r\nThis morning we set out early and proceeded on tolerably well untill 8\r\nOCT. by which time we had arrived within a few miles of a mountain\r\nthrough which the river passes. we halted on the Stard. side and took\r\nbreakfast. after which or at 1/2 after 8 A.M. as had been previously\r\nconcerted betwen Capt. Clark and myself I set out with three men in\r\nsurch of the Snake Indians or Sosonees. our rout lay over a high range\r\nof mountains on the North side of the river. Capt C. recommended this\r\nrout to me no doubt from a beleif that the river as soon as it passed\r\nthis chain of mountains boar to the N. of W. he having on the 26th ult.\r\nascended these mountains to a position from whence he discoved a large\r\nvalley passing between the mountains which boar to the N. W. and\r\npresumed that the river passed in that direction; this however proved\r\nto be the passage of a large creek which discharged itself into the\r\nriver just above this range of mountains, the river bearing to the S.\r\nW. we were therefore thrown several miles out of our rout. as soon as\r\nwe discovered our error we directed our course to the river which we at\r\nlength gained about 2 P.M. much exhausted by the heat of the day, the\r\nroughness of the road and the want of water. the mountains are\r\nextreemly bare of timber, and our rout lay through the steep and narrow\r\nhollows of the mountains exposed to the intese heat of the midday sun\r\nwithout shade or scarcely a breath of air to add to my fatiegue in this\r\nwalk of about 11 miles, I had taken a doze of glauber salts in the\r\nmorning in consequence of a slight disentary with which I had been\r\nafflicted for several days. being weakened by the disorder and the\r\noperation of the medicine I found myself almost exhausted before we\r\nreached the river. I felt my sperits much revived on our near approach\r\nto the river at the sight of a herd of Elk, of which Drewyer and myself\r\nsoon killed a couple. we then hurryed to the river and allayed our\r\nthirst. I ordered two of the men to skin the Elk and bring the meat to\r\nthe river, while myself and the other prepared a fire and cooked some\r\nof the meat for our dinner. we made a comfortable meal on the Elk, and\r\nleft the ballance of the meat and skins on the bank of the river for\r\nCapt. Clark and party. this supply will no doubt be acceptable to them,\r\nas they had had no fresh meat when I left them for almost 2 days except\r\none beaver; game being very scarce and shy above the forks. we had seen\r\na few deer and antelopes but had not been fortunate enough to kill any\r\nof them. as I passed these mountains I saw a flock of the black or dark\r\nbrown phesants; the young phesant is almost grown we killed one of\r\nthem. this bird is fully a third larger than the common phesant of the\r\nAtlantic states. it's form is much the same. it is booted nearly to the\r\ntoes and the male has not the tufts of long black feathers on the sides\r\nof the neck which are so conspicuous in those of the Atlantic. their\r\ncolour is a uniform dark brown with a small mixture of yellow or\r\nyelloish brown specks on some of the feathers particularly those of the\r\ntail, tho the extremities of these are perfectly black for about one\r\ninch. the eye is nearly black, the iris has a small dash of yellowish\r\nbrown. the feathers of the tail are reather longer than that of our\r\nphesant or pattridge as they are Called in the Eastern States; are the\r\nsame in number or eighteen and all nearly of the same length, those in\r\nthe intermediate part being somewhat longest. the flesh of this bird is\r\nwhite and agreeably flavored. I also saw near the top of the mountain\r\namong some scattering pine a blue bird about the size of the common\r\nrobbin. it's action and form is somewhat that of the jay bird and never\r\nrests long in any one position but constantly flying or hoping from\r\nsprey to sprey. I shot at one of them but missed it. their note is loud\r\nand frequently repeated both flying and when at rest and is char ah',\r\nchar'ah, char ah', as nearly as letters can express it. after dinner we\r\nresumed our march and my pack felt much lighter than it had done about\r\n2 hours before. we traveled about six miles further and encamped on the\r\nstard. bank of the river, making a distance of 17 miles for this day.\r\nthe Musquetoes were troublesome but I had taken the precaution of\r\nbringing my bier.\r\n\r\nShortly after I left Capt. Clark this morning he proceed on and passed\r\nthrough the mountains; they formed tremendious clifts of ragged and\r\nnearly perpendicular rocks; the lower.part of this rock is of the\r\nblack grannite before mentioned and the upper part a light coloured\r\nfreestone. these clifts continue for 9 miles and approach the river\r\nvery closely on either side. he found the current verry strong. Capt.\r\nC. killed a big horn on these clifts which himself and party dined on.\r\nafter passing this range of mountains he entered this beautifull valley\r\nin which we also were it is from 6 to 8 miles wide. the river is\r\ncrooked and crouded with islands, it's bottoms wide fertile and covered\r\nwith fine grass from 9 inches to 2 feet high and possesses but a scant\r\nproportion of timber, which consists almost entirely of a few narrow\r\nleafed cottonwood trees distributed along the verge of the river. in\r\nthe evening Capt. C. found the Elk I had left him and ascended a short\r\ndistance above to the entrance of a large creek which falls in on\r\nStard. and encamped opposite to it on the Lard. side. he sent out the\r\ntwo Fieldses to hunt this evening and they killed 5 deer, which with\r\nthe Elk again gave them a plentifull store of fresh provisions. this\r\nlarge creek we called Field's Creek after Reubin Fields one our party.\r\non the river about the mountains wich Capt. C. passed today he saw some\r\nlarge cedar trees and some juniper also just at the upper side of the\r\nmountain there is a bad rappid here the toe line of our canoe broke in\r\nthe shoot of the rapids and swung on the rocks and had very nearly\r\noverset. a small distance above this rapid a large bold Creek falls in\r\non Lard. side which we called Frazier's Creek after Robt. Frazier. They\r\nsaw a large brown bear feeding on currants but could not get a shoot at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 1, 1805]\r\nAugust 1st Wednesday 1805\r\nA fine day Capt. Lewis left me at 8 oClock just below the place I\r\nentered a verrey high mountain which jutted its tremedious Clifts on\r\neither Side for 9 Miles, the rocks ragide Some verry dark & other part\r\nverry light rock the light rocks is Sand Stone. The water Swift & very\r\nSholey. I killed a Ibix on which the whole party Dined, after passing\r\nthrough the Mountain we entered a wide extesive vallie of from 4 to 8\r\nMiles wide verry leavell a Creek falls in at the Commencement of this\r\nVallie on the Lard Side, the river widens & spreds into Small Chanels.\r\nWe encamped on the Lard Side opposit a large Creek I sent out Jo. & R\r\nfields to hunt this evening they killed 5 Deer, I saw a large Bear\r\neateing Currents this evining The river so rapid that the greatest\r\nexertion is required by all to get the boats on wind S W Murckery at\r\nsun rise 50° Ab. 0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 2, 1805]\r\nAugust 2nd 1805.\r\nWe resumed our march this morning at sunrise the weather was fair and\r\nwind from N. W. finding that the river still boar to the south I\r\ndetermined to pass it if possible to shorten our rout this we effected\r\nabout five miles above our camp of last evening by wading it. found the\r\ncurrent very rappid about 90 yards wide and waist deep this is the\r\nfirst time that I ever dared to make the attempt to wade the river, tho\r\nthere are many places between this and the three forks where I presume\r\nit migh be attempted with equal success. the valley though which our\r\nrout of this day lay and through which the river winds it's meandering\r\ncourse is a beatifull level plain with but little timber and that on\r\nthe verge of the river. the land is tolerably fertile, consisting of a\r\nblack or dark yellow loam, and covered with grass from 9 Inches to 2\r\nfeet high. the plain ascends gradually on either side of the river to\r\nthe bases of two ranges of mountains which ly parrallel to the river\r\nand which terminate the width of the vally. the tops of these mountains\r\nwere yet partially covered with snow while we in the valley. were\r\nsuffocated nearly with the intense heat of the midday sun. the nights\r\nare so could that two blankets are not more than sufficient covering.\r\nwe found a great courants, two kinds of which were red, others yellow\r\ndeep purple and black, also black goosburies and service buries now\r\nripe and in full perfection, we feasted suptuously on our wild fruit\r\nparticularly the yellow courant and the deep purple servicebury which I\r\nfound to be excellent the courrant grows very much like the red currant\r\ncommon to the gardens in the atlantic states tho the leaf is somewhat\r\ndifferent and the growth taller. the service burry grows on a smaller\r\nbush and differs from ours only in colour and the superior excellence\r\nof it's flavor and size, it is of a deep purple. this day we saw an\r\nabundance of deer and goats or antelopes and a great number of the\r\ntracks of Elk; of the former we killed two. we continued our rout along\r\nthis valley which is from six to eight Miles wide untill sun set when\r\nwe encamped for the night on the river bank having traveled about 24\r\nmiles. I feel myself perfectly recovered of my indisposition and do not\r\ndoubt being able to pursue my march with equal comfort in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 2, 1805]\r\nFriday August 2cd 1805.\r\nWe resumed our march this morning at sunrise; the day was fair and wind\r\nfrom N. W. finding that the river still boar to the South I determined\r\nto pass it if possible in order to shorten our rout; this we effected\r\nby wading the river about 5 miles above our encampment of the last\r\nevening. we found the current very rapid waist deep and about 90 yd.\r\nwide bottom smooth pebble with a small mixture of coarse gravel. this\r\nis the first time that I ever dared to wade the river, tho there are\r\nmany places between this and the forks where I presume it might be\r\nattempted with equal success. The vally allong which we passed today,\r\nand through which the river winds it's meandering course is from 6 to 8\r\nmiles wide and consists of a beatifull level plain with but little\r\ntimber and that confined to the verge of the river; the land is\r\ntolerably fertile, and is either black or a dark yellow loam, covered\r\nwith grass from 9 inches to 2 feet high. the plain ascends gradually on\r\neither side of the river to the bases of two ranges of high mountains,\r\nwhich lye parallel to the river and prescribe the limits of the plains.\r\nthe tops of these mountains are yet covered partially with snow, while\r\nwe in the valley are nearly suffocated with the intense heat of the\r\nmidday sun; the nights are so cold that two blankets are not more than\r\nsufficient covering. soon after passing the river this morning Sergt.\r\nGass lost my tommahawk in the thick brush and we were unable to find\r\nit, I regret the loss of this usefull implement, however accedents will\r\nhappen in the best families, and I consoled myself with the\r\nrecollection that it was not the only one we had with us. the bones of\r\nthe buffaloe and their excrement of an old date are to be met with in\r\nevery part of this valley but we have long since lost all hope of\r\nmeeting with that animal in these mountains. we met with great\r\nquantities of currants today, two species of which were red, others\r\nyellow, deep perple and black; also black goosberries and\r\nserviceberries now ripe and in great perfection. we feasted sumptuously\r\non our wild fruits, particularly the yellow currant and the deep perple\r\nserviceberries, which I found to be excellent. the serviceberry grows\r\non a small bush and differs from ours only in colour size and superior\r\nexcellence of it's flavour. it is somewhat larger than ours. on our way\r\nwe saw an abundance of deer Antelopes, of the former we killed 2. we\r\nalso saw many tracks of the Elk and bear. no recent appearance of\r\nIndians. the Indians in this part of the country appear to construct\r\ntheir lodges with the willow boughs and brush; they are small of a\r\nconic figure and have a small aperture on one side through which they\r\nenter. we continued our rout up this valley on the Lard. side of the\r\nriver untill sunset, at which time we encamped on the Lard. bank of the\r\nriver having traveled 24 miles. we had brought with us a good stock of\r\nvenison of which we eat a hearty supper. I feel myself perfectly\r\nrecovered of my indisposition, and do not doubt being able to pursue my\r\nrout tomorrow with the same comfort I have done today.--we saw some\r\nvery large beaver dams today in the bottoms of the river several of\r\nwhich wer five feet high and overflowed several acres of land; these\r\ndams are formed of willow brush mud and gravel and are so closely\r\ninterwoven that they resist the water perfectly. the base of this work\r\nis thick and rises nearly perpendicularly on the lower side while the\r\nupper side or that within the dam is gently sloped. the brush appear to\r\nbe laid in no regular order yet acquires a strength by the irregularity\r\nwith which they are placed by the beaver that it would puzzle the\r\nengenuity of man to give them.\r\n\r\nCapt. Clark continued his rout early this morning. the rapidity of the\r\ncurrent was such that his progress was slow, in short it required the\r\nutmost exertion of the men to get on, nor could they resist this\r\ncurrent by any other means than that of the cord and pole. in the\r\ncourse of the day they passed some villages of burrowing squirrels, saw\r\na number of beaver dams and the inhabitants of them, many young ducks\r\nboth of the Duckanmallard and the redheaded fishing duck, gees, several\r\nrattle snakes, black woodpeckers, and a large gang of Elk; they found\r\nthe river much crouded with island both large and small and passed a\r\nsmall creek on Stard. side which we called birth Creek. Capt. Clark\r\ndiscovers a tumor rising on the inner side of his ankle this evening\r\nwhich was painfull to him. they incamped in a level bottom on the Lard.\r\nside.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 2, 1805]\r\nAugust 2nd Friday 1805\r\na fine day Set out early the river has much the Same kind of banks\r\nChanel Current &c. as it had in the last vallie, I walked out this\r\nmorning on Shore & Saw Several rattle Snakes in the plain, the wind\r\nfrom the S W we proceeded on with great dificuelty from the rapidity of\r\nthe current & rapids, abt. 15 miles and Encamped on the Lard Side, saw\r\na large Gangue of Elk at Sunset to the S W. passed a Small Creek on the\r\nStard Side and maney large and Small Islands.

Drewyer killed a\r\ndoe and we halted and took breakfast. the mountains continue high on\r\neither side of the valley, and are but skantily supplyed with timber;\r\nsmall pine appears to be the prevalent growth. there is no timber in\r\nthe valley except a small quantity of the narrow leafed cottonwood on\r\nthe verge of the river. the underwood consists of the narrowleafed or\r\nsmall willow, honeysuckle rosebushes, courant, goosbury and service\r\nbury bushes allso a small quantity of a species of dwarf burch the leaf\r\nof which, oval, deep green, finely indented and very small. we encamped\r\nthis evening after sunset having traveled by estimate 23 miles. from\r\nthe width and appearance of the valley at this place I concieved that\r\nthe river forked not far above me and therefore resolved the next\r\nmorning to examine the adjacent country more minutely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 3, 1805]\r\nSaturday August 3rd 1805.\r\nSet out early this morning, or before sunrise; still continued our\r\nmarch through the level valley on the lard. side of the river. the\r\nvalley much as yesterday only reather wider; I think it 12 Miles wide,\r\ntho the plains near the mountains rise higher and are more broken with\r\nsome scattering pine near the mountain. in the leaveler parts of the\r\nplain and river bottoms which are very extensive there is no timber\r\nexcept a scant proportion of cottonwood neat the river. the under wood\r\nconsists of the narrow leafed or small willow, the small honeysuckle,\r\nrosebushes, currant, serviceberry, and goosbery bushes; also a small\r\nspecies of berth in but small quantities the leaf which is oval finely,\r\nindented, small and of a deep green colour. the stem is simple\r\nascending and branching, and seldom rises higher than 10 or 12 feet.\r\nthe Mountains continue high on either side of the valley, and are but\r\nscantily supplyed with timber; small pine apears to be the prevalent\r\ngrowth; it is of the pith kind, with a short leaf. at 11 A.M. Drewyer\r\nkilled a doe and we halted about 2 hours and breakfasted, and then\r\ncontinued our rout untill night without halting, when we arrived at the\r\nriver in a level bottom which appeared to spread to greater extent than\r\nusual. from the appearance of the timber I supposed that the river\r\nforked above us and resolved to examine this part of the river minutely\r\ntomorrow. this evening we passed through a high plain for about 8 miles\r\ncovered with prickley pears and bearded grass, tho we found this even\r\nbetter walking than the wide bottoms of the river, which we passed in\r\nthe evening; these altho apparently level, from some cause which I know\r\nnot, were formed into meriads of deep holes as if rooted up by hogs\r\nthese the grass covered so thick that it was impossible to walk without\r\nthe risk of falling down at every step. some parts of these bottoms\r\nalso possess excellent terf or peat, I beleive of many feet deep. the\r\nmineral salts also frequently mentioned on the Missouri we saw this\r\nevening in these uneven bottoms. we saw many deer, Antelopes ducks,\r\ngees, some beaver and great appearance of their work. also a small bird\r\nand the Curlooe as usual. we encamped on the river bank on Lard. side\r\nhaving traveled by estimate 23 Miles. The fish of this part of the\r\nriver are trout and a species of scale fish of a white colour and a\r\nremarkable small long mouth which one of our men inform us are the same\r\nwith the species called in the Eastern states bottlenose. the snowey\r\nregion of the mountains and for some distance below has no timber or\r\nherbage of any kind; the timber is confined to the lower and middle\r\nregions. Capt. Clark set out this morning as usual. he walked on shore\r\na small distance this morning and killed a deer. in the course of his\r\nwalk he saw a track which he supposed to be that of an Indian from the\r\ncircumstance of the large toes turning inward. he pursued the track and\r\nfound that the person had ascended a point of a hill from which his\r\ncamp of the last evening was visible; this circumstance also confirmed\r\nthe beleif of it's being an Indian who had thus discovered them and ran\r\noff. they found the river as usual much crouded with islands, the\r\ncurrant more rapid & much more shallow than usual. in many places they\r\nwere obliged to double man the canoes and drag them over the stone and\r\ngravel. this morning they passed a small creek on Stard. at the\r\nentrance of which Reubin Fields killed a large Panther. we called the\r\ncreek after that animal Panther Creek. they also passed a handsome\r\nlittle stream on Lard. which is form of several large springs which\r\nrise in the bottoms and along the base of the mountains with some\r\nlittle rivulets from the melting snows. the beaver have formed many\r\nlarge dams on this stream. they saw some deer Antelopes and the common\r\nbirds of the country. in the evening they passed a very bad rappid\r\nwhere the bed of the river is formed entrely of solid rock and encamped\r\non an island just above. the Panther which Fields killed measured seven\r\nand 1/2 feet from the nose to the extremity of the tail. it is precisely\r\n the same animal common to the western part of our country. the men wer\r\ncompelled to be a great proportion of their time in the water today;\r\nthey have had a severe days labour and are much fortiegued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 3, 1805]\r\nAugust 3rd Saturday1805\r\na fine morning wind from the N E I walked on Shore & killed a Deer in\r\nmy walk I saw a fresh track which I took to be an Indian from the Shape\r\nof the foot as the toes turned in, I think it probable that this Indian\r\nSpied our fires and Came to a Situation to view us from the top of a\r\nSmall knob on the Lard Side. the river more rapid and Sholey than\r\nyesterday one R. F. man killed a large Panthor on the Shore we are\r\noblige to haul over the Canoes Sholey in maney places where the Islands\r\nare noumerous and bottom Sholey, in the evening the river more rapid\r\nand Sholey we encamped on an Island avove a part of the river which\r\npassed thro a rockey bed enclosed on both sides with thick willow\r\ncurrent & red buries &c &c passed a bold Stream which heads in the\r\nmountains to our right and the drean of the minting Snow in the Montn.\r\non that side ar in View--at 4 oClock passed a bold Stream which falls\r\nfrom a mountn in three Channels to our left, the Greater portion of the\r\nSnow on this mountain is melted, but little remaining near us Some Deer\r\nElk & antelopes & Bear in the bottoms. but fiew trees and they Small\r\nthe Mountains on our left Contain pine those on our right but verry\r\npartially Supplied and what pine & cedar it has is on the Lower region,\r\nno wood being near the Snow. great numbers of Beaver Otter &c.

E. by E. about 4 Miles\r\nwhen we passed a bould runing creek about 12 yards wide the water could\r\nand remarkably clear, we then changed our course to S. E. passing\r\nobliquely across a valley which boar nearly E leaving the valley which\r\nwe had pursued for the 2 precedeing days. at the distance of 3 miles we\r\npassed a handsome little river which passes through this valley; it is\r\nabout 30 yards wide affords a considerable quantity of water and I\r\nbelieve it may be navigated some miles. I then changed my rout to S. W.\r\npassed a high plain which lyes between the vallies and returned to the\r\nS. valley, in passing which I fell in with a river about 45 yards wide\r\nwhich I waideg and then continued my rout down to it's junction with\r\nthe river just mentioned, and from thence to the entrance of the creek\r\nwhich falls in about 2 miles below; still continuing my rout down this\r\nstream about three miles further and about 2 M. below our encampment of\r\nthe last evening this river forms a junction with a river 50 yards wide\r\nwhich comes from the N. W. and falling into the S. valley runs\r\nparrallel with the middle fork about 12 miles. this is a bould rappid &\r\nclear stream it's bed so broken and obstructed by gravel bars and\r\nIslands that it appeared to me impossible to navigate it with safety.\r\nthe middle fork is gentle and possesses about 2/3ds as much water as\r\nthis rappid stream, it's cours so far as I can observe it is about S.\r\nW. and it appears to be navigable; its water is much warmer than that\r\nof the rappid fork and somewhat turbid, from which I concluded that it\r\nhad it's source at a greater distance in the mountains and passed\r\nthrough an opener country than the other. under this impression I wrote\r\na note to Capt. Clark recommending his taking the middle fork provided\r\nhe should arrive at this place before my return which I expect will be\r\nthe day after tomorrow. the note I left on a pole at the forks of the\r\nriver and having refreshed ourselves and eat heartily of some venison\r\nwe killed this morning I continued my rout up the Stard side of the N.\r\nW. fork, determining to pursue it untill 12 OC. the next day and then\r\npass over to the middle fork and return to their junction or untill I\r\nmet Capt. Clark. we encamped this evening near the point where the\r\nriver leaves the valley and enters the mountains, having traveled about\r\n20 miles.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 4, 1805]\r\nSunday August 4th 1805.\r\nSet out very early this morning and Steered S. E. by E. 4 M. when we\r\npased a bold runing Creek 12 yds. wide, the water of which was clear\r\nand very cold. it appears to be formed by four dranes from the snowey\r\nmountains to our left. after passing this creek we changed our\r\ndirection to S. E. passing obliquely across a valley which boar E\r\nleaving the valley we had pursued for the two peceeding days. at the\r\ndistance of 3 Ms. we passed a handsome little river which meanders\r\nthrough this valley; it is about 30 yds wide, affords a considerable\r\nquantity of water and appears as if it might be navigated some miles.\r\nthe currant is not rapid nor the water very clear; the banks are low\r\nand the bed formed of stone and gravel. I now changed my rout to S. W.\r\npassed a high plain which lies betwen the valleies and returned to the\r\nSouth valley, in passing which I fell in with a river about 45 yds.\r\nwide gravley bottom gentle currant waist deep and water of a whitish\r\nblue tinge. this stream we waded and continued our rout down it to the\r\nentrance of the river just mentioned about 3/4 of a mile. still\r\ncontinuing down we passed the entrance of the creek about 2 miles lower\r\ndown; and at the distance of three miles further arrived at it's\r\njunction with a river 50 yds. wide which Comes from the S. W. and\r\nfalling into the South valley runs parallel with the middle fork about\r\n12 miles before it forms a junction. I now found that our encampment of\r\nthe last evening was about 11/2 miles above the entrance of this large\r\nriver on Stard. this is a bold rappid and Clear Stream, it's bed so\r\nmuch broken and obstructed by gravley bars and it's waters so much\r\nsubdivided by Islands that it appears to me utterly impossible to\r\nnavigate it with safety. the middle fork is gentle and possesses about\r\n2/3rds as much water as this stream. it's course so far as I can\r\nobserve it is about S. W., and from the opening of the valley I beleive\r\nit still bears more to the West above it may be safely navigated. it's\r\nwater is much warmer then the rapid fork and it's water more turbid;\r\nfrom which I conjecture that it has it's sources at a greater distance\r\nin the mountains and passes through an opener country than the other.\r\nunder this impression I wrote a note to Capt Clark, recommending his\r\ntaking the middle fork povided he should arrive at this place before my\r\nreturn, which I expect will be the day after tomorrow. this note I left\r\non a pole at the forks of the river, and having refreshed ourselves and\r\neat heartily of some venison which we killed this morning we continued\r\nour rout up the rapid fork on the Stard side, resolving to pursue this\r\nstream untill noon tomorrow and then pass over to the middle fork and\r\ncome down it to their junction or untill I meet Capt Clark. I have seen\r\nno recent Indian sign in the course of my rout as yet. Charbono\r\ncomplains much of his leg, and is the cause of considerable detention\r\nto us. we encamped on the river bank near the place at which it leaves\r\nthe valley and enters the mountain having traveled about 23 miles. we\r\nsaw some Antelopes deer Grains, gees, and ducks of the two species\r\ncommon to this country. the summer duck has ceased to appear, nor do I\r\nbeleive it is an inhabitant of this part of the country. the timber &c\r\nis as heretofore tho there is more in this valley on the rapid fork\r\nthan we have seen in the same extent on the river since we entered this\r\nvalley. the Indians appear on some parts of the river to have distroyed\r\na great proportion of the little timber which there is by seting fire\r\nto the bottoms. This morning Capt. Clark set out at sunrise, and sent\r\ntwo hunters ahead to kill some meat. at 8 A.M. he arrived at my camp of\r\nthe 2ed inst. where he breakfasted; here he found a note which I had\r\nleft for him at that place informing him of the occurences of my rout\r\n&c. the river continued to be crouded with Islands, rapid and shoaly.\r\nthese shoals or riffles succeeded each other every 3 or four hundred\r\nyards; at those places they are obliged to drag the canoes over the\r\nstone there not being water enough to float them, and betwen the riffles\r\n the current is so strong that they are compelled to have cecourse to\r\nthe cord; and being unable to walk on the shore for the brush wade in\r\nthe river along the shore and hawl them by the cord; this has increased\r\nthe pain and labour extreemly; their feet soon get tender and soar by\r\nwading and walking over the stones. these are also so slipry that they\r\nfrequently get severe falls. being constantly wet soon makes them feble\r\nalso. their hunters killed 2 deer today and some gees and ducks wer\r\nkilled by those who navigated the canoes. they saw deer antelopes\r\nGrains beaver Otter &c. Capt. Clark's ancle became so painfull to him\r\nthat he was unable to walk.--This evening they encamped on the Stard.\r\nside in a bottom of cottonwood timber all much fatiegued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 4, 1805]\r\nAugust 4th Sunday 1805\r\na fine morning cool proceeded on verry early and Brackfast at the Camp\r\nCapt Lewis left yesterday morning, at this Camp he left a note\r\ninforming that he discovered no fresh Sign of Indians &c. The river\r\ncontinued to be crouded with Islands Sholey rapid & clear, I could not\r\nwalk on Shore to day as my ankle was Sore from a turner on that part.\r\nthe method we are compelled to take to get on is fatigueing & laborious\r\nin the extreen, haul the Canoes over the rapids, which Suckceed each\r\nother every two or three hundred yards and between the water rapid\r\noblige to towe & walke on Stones the whole day except when we have\r\npoleing men wet all day Sore feet &c. &c Murcury at Sun rise 49 a. 0,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 5, 1805]\r\nMonday August 5th 1805\r\nAs Charbono complained of being unable to march far today I ordered him\r\nand Sergt. Gass to pass the rappid river near our camp and proceed at\r\ntheir leasure through the level bottom to a point of high timber about\r\nseven miles distant on the middle fork which was in view; I gave them\r\nmy pack that of Drewyer and the meat which we had, directing them to\r\nremain at that place untill we joined them. I took Drewyer with me and\r\ncontinued my rout up the stard. side of the river about 4 miles and\r\nthen waded it; found it so rapid and shallow that it was impossible to\r\nnavigate it. continued up it on the Lard. side about 11/2 miles further\r\nwhen the mountains put in close on both sides and arrose to great\r\nhight, partially covered with snow. from hence the course of the river\r\nwas to the East of North. I took the advantage of a high projecting\r\nspur of the mountain which with some difficulty we ascended to it's\r\nsummit in about half an hour. from this eminance I had a pleasing view\r\nof the valley through which I had passed many miles below and the\r\ncontinuation of the middle fork through the valley equally wide above\r\nme to the distance of about 20 miles when that also appeared to enter\r\nthe mountains and disappeared to my view; however the mountains which\r\ntermineate the valley in this direction appeared much lower than those\r\nup either of the other forks. on the rapid fork they appeared still to\r\nrise the one range towering above another as far as I could perceive\r\nthem. the middle fork as I suspected dose bear considerably to the West\r\nof South and the gap formed by it in the mountains after the valley\r\nterminates is in the same direction. under these circumstances I did\r\nnot hesitate in beleiving the middle fork the most proper for us to\r\nascend. about South from me, the middle fork approached within about 5\r\nmiles. I resolved to pass across the plains to it and return to Gass\r\nand Charbono, accordingly we set out and decended the mountain among\r\nsome steep and difficult precipices of rocks. here Drewyer missed his\r\nstep and had a very dangerous fall, he sprained one of his fingers and\r\nhirt his leg very much. in fifteen or 20 minutes he was able to proceed\r\nand we continued our rout to the river where we had desighned to\r\ninterscept it. I quenched my thirst and rested a few minutes examined\r\nthe river and found it still very navi-gable. an old indian road very\r\nlarge and plain leads up this fork, but I could see no tracks except\r\nthose of horses which appeared to have passed early in the spring. as\r\nthe river mad a great bend to the South East we again ascended the high\r\nplain and steered our course as streight as we could to the point where\r\nI had directed Gass and Sharbono to remain. we passed the plain\r\nregained the bottom and struck the river about 3 miles above them; by\r\nthis time it was perfectly dark & we hooped but could hear no tidings\r\nof them. we had struck the river at the point of timber to which I had\r\ndirected them, but having mistaken a point of woods lower down, had\r\nhalted short of the place. we continued our rout after dark down the\r\nbottom through thick brush of the pulppy leafed thorn and prickly pears\r\nfor about 2 hours when we arrived at their camp. they had a small\r\nquantity of meat left which Drewyer and myself eat it being the first\r\nwe had taisted today. we had traveled about 25 miles. I soon laid down\r\nand slept very soundly untill morning. I saw no deer today nor any game\r\nexcept a few Antelopes which were very shy. the soil of the plains is a\r\nlight yellow clay very meager and intermixed with a large proportion of\r\ngravel, producing nothing except the twisted or bearded grass, sedge\r\nand prickly pears. the dryer parts of the bottoms are also much more\r\nindifferent in point of soil to those below and are covered with the\r\nsouthernwood pulpy leafed thorn and prickley pears with but little\r\ngrass. the moist parts are fertile and covered with fine grass and sand\r\nrushes.\r\n\r\nThis morning Capt. Clark set out at sunrise and dispatched Joseph &\r\nReubin Fields to hunt. they killed two deer on one of which the party\r\nbreakfasted. the river today they found streighter and more rapid even\r\nthan yesterday, and the labour and difficulty of the navigation was\r\nproportionably increased, they therefore proceeded but slowly and with\r\ngreat pain as the men had become very languid from working in the water\r\nand many of their feet swolen and so painfull that they could scarcely\r\nwalk. at 4 P.M. they arrived at the confluence of the two rivers where\r\nI had left the note. this note had unfortunately been placed on a green\r\npole which the beaver had cut and carried off together with the note;\r\nthe possibility of such an occurrence never one occurred to me when I\r\nplaced it on the green pole. this accedent deprived Capt. Clark of any\r\ninformation with ripect to the country and supposing that the rapid\r\nfork was most in the direction which it was proper we should pursue, or\r\nWest, he took that stream and asscended it with much difficulty about a\r\nmile and encamped on an island that had been lately overflown and was\r\nyet damp; they were therefore compelled to make beds of brush to keep\r\nthemselves out of the mud. in ascending this stream for about a quarter\r\nof a mile it scattered in such a maner that they were obliged to cut a\r\npassage through the willow brush which leant over the little channels\r\nand united their tops. Capt. Clarks ankle is extreemly painfull to him\r\nthis evening; the tumor has not yet mature, he has a slight fever.--The\r\nmen were so much fortiegued today that they wished much that navigation\r\nwas at an end that they might go by land.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 5, 1805]\r\nAugust 5th Monday 1805\r\na Cold Clear morning the wind from the S.

The S W fok contains more timber\r\nthan is below for Some distance, we assended this fork about one mile\r\nand Encamped on an Island which had been laterly overflown & was wet we\r\nraised our bead on bushes, we passed a part of the river above the\r\nforks which was divided and Scattered thro the willows in Such a manner\r\nas to render it dificuelt to pass through for a 1/4 of a mile, we wer\r\noblige to Cut our way thro the willows--Men much fatigued from their\r\nexcessive labours in hauling the Canoes over the rapids &c. verry weak\r\nbeing in the water all day. my foot verry painfull\r\n\r\nAssended the N W Fork 9 miles on a Course S. 30° W. to a Bluff on the\r\nStard. Side passed Several Bayous & Islands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 6, 1805]\r\nTuesday August 6th 1805.\r\nWe set out this morning very early on our return to the forks. having\r\nnothing to eat I set Drewyer to the woodlands to my left in order to\r\nkill a deer, sent Sergt. Gass to the right with orders to keep\r\nsufficiently near to discover Capt. C. and the party should they be on\r\ntheir way up that stream, and with Sharbono I directed my course to the\r\nmain forks through the bottom directing the others to meet us there.\r\nabout five miles above the forks I head the hooping of the party to my\r\nleft and changed my rout towards them; on my arrival found that they\r\nhad taken the rapid fork and learnt from Capt. Clark that he had not\r\nfound the note which I had left for him at that place and the reasons\r\nwhich had induced him to ascend this stream. it was easeist & more in\r\nour direction, and apd. to contain as much water he had hoever\r\npreviously to my comeing up with him, met Drewyer who informed him of\r\nthe state of the two rivers and was on his return. one of their canoes\r\nhad just overset and all the baggage wet, the medecine box among other\r\narticles and several articles lost a shot pouch and horn with all the\r\nimplements for one rifle lost and never recovered. I walked down to the\r\npoint where I waited their return. on their arrival found that two\r\nother canoes had filled with water and wet their cargoes completely.\r\nWhitehouse had been thrown out of one of the canoes as she swing in a\r\nrapid current and the canoe had rubed him and pressed him to the bottom\r\nas she passed over him and had the water been 2 inches shallower must\r\ninevitably have crushed him to death. our parched meal, corn, Indian\r\npreasents, and a great part of our most valuable stores were wet and\r\nmuch damaged on this ocasion. to examine, dry and arrange our stores\r\nwas the first object; we therefore passed over to the lard. side\r\nopposite to the entrance of the rapid fork where there was a large\r\ngravly bar that answered our purposes; wood was also convenient and\r\nplenty. here we fixed our camp, and unloaded all our canoes and opened\r\nand exposed to dry such articles as had been wet. a part of the load of\r\neach canoe consisted of the leaden canestirs of powder which were not\r\nin least injured, tho some of them had remained upwards of an hour\r\nunder water. about 20 lbs. of powder which we had in a tight Keg or at\r\nleast one which we thought sufficiently so got wet and intirely\r\nspoiled. this would have been the case with the other had it not have\r\nbeen for the expedient which I had fallen on of securing the powder by\r\nmeans of the lead having the latter formed into canesters which were\r\nfilled with the necessary proportion of poder to discharge the lead\r\nwhen used, and those canesters well secured with corks and wax. in this\r\ncountry the air is so pure and dry that any vessel however well\r\nseasoned the timber may be will give way or shrink unless it is kept\r\nfull of some liquid. we found that three deer skins which we had left\r\nat a considerable hight on a tree were taken off which we supposed had\r\nbeen done by a panther. we sent out some men to hunt this evening, they\r\nkilled 3 deer and four Elk which gave us a plentifull supply of meat\r\nonce more. Shannon had been dispatched up the rapid fork this morning\r\nto hunt, by Capt Clark before he met with Drewyer or learnt his mistake\r\nin the rivers. when he returned he sent Drewyer in surch of him, but he\r\nrejoined us this evening and reported that he had been several miles up\r\nthe river and could find nothing of him. we had the trumpet sounded and\r\nfired several guns but he did not join us this evening. I am fearful he\r\nis lost again. this is the same man who was seperated from us 15 days\r\nas we came up the Missouri and subsisted 9 days of that time on grapes\r\nonly. Whitehouse is in much pain this evening with the injury one of\r\nhis legs sustained from the canoe today at the time it upset and swing\r\nover him. Capt Clarks ankle is also very painfull to him.--we should\r\nhave given the party a days rest some where near this place had not\r\nthis accedent happened, as I had determined to take some observations\r\nto fix the Latitude and longitude of these forks. our merchandize\r\nmedecine &c are not sufficiently dry this evening we covered them\r\nsecurely for the evening. Capt Clark had ascended the river about 9\r\nmiles from this place on a course of S 30° W. before he met with Drewyer.\r\n\r\nwe beleive that the N. W. or rapid fork is the dane of the melting\r\nsnows of the mountains, and that it is not as long as the middle fork\r\nand dose not at all seasons of the year supply any thing like as much\r\nwater as the other and that about this season it rises to it's greatest\r\nhight. this last appears from the apparent bed of the river which is\r\nnow overflown and the water in many plases spreads through old channels\r\nwhich have their bottoms covered with grass that has grown this season\r\nand is such as appears on the parts of the bottom not innundated. we\r\ntherefore determined that the middle fork was that which ought of right\r\nto bear the name we had given to the lower portion or River Jefferson\r\nand called the bold rapid an clear stream Wisdom, and the more mild and\r\nplacid one which flows in from the S. E. Philanthrophy, in\r\ncommemoration of two of those cardinal virtues, which have so eminently\r\nmarked that deservedly selibrated character through life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 6, 1805]\r\nAugust 6th Tuesday 1805\r\na Clear morning Cool wind from the S W we proceeded on with much\r\ndificuelty and fatigue over rapids & Stones; river about 40 or 50 yards\r\nwide much divided by Islands and narrow Bayoos to a low bluff on the\r\nStard Side & Brackfast, dureing the time of Brackfast Drewyer Came to\r\nme from Capt. Lewis and informed me that they had explored both forks\r\nfor 30 or 40 miles & that the one we were assending was impractiabl\r\nmuch further up & turned imediately to the north, The middle fork he\r\nreported was jintle and after a Short distanc turned to the S. W. and\r\nthat all the Indian roades leades up the middle fork. this report\r\ndeturmind me to take the middle fork, accordingly Droped down to the\r\nforks where I met with Capt Lewis & party, Capt Lewis had left a Letter\r\non a pole in the forks informing me what he had discovered & the course\r\nof the rivers &c. this lettr was Cut down by the beaver as it was on a\r\ngreen pole & Carried off. Three Skins which was left on a tree was\r\ntaken off by the Panthers or wolvers. In decending to the Point one\r\nCanoe Struck & turned on a rapid & Sunk, and wet every thing which was\r\nin her, this misfortune obliged us to halt at the forks and dry those\r\narticles, one other Canoe nearly turning over, filled half full of\r\nwater & wet our medison & Some Goods Corn &c. Several hunters out to\r\nday & killed a young Elk, Antilope, & 3 Deer, one man Shannon did not\r\nreturn to night--This evening Cool my anckle much wors than it has\r\nbeen--this evening a Violent wind from the N. W accompanied with rain\r\nwhich lasted half an hour wind N. W\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 7, 1805]\r\nWednesday August 7th 1805.\r\nThe morning being fair we spread our stores to dry at an early hour.\r\nDispatched Reubin Fields in surch of Shannon. our stores were now so\r\nmuch exhausted that we found we could proceed with one canoe less. we\r\ntherefore drew out one of them into a thicket of brush and secured her\r\nin such manner that the water could not take her off should the river\r\nrise to the hight where she is. The creek which falls in above us we\r\ncalled turf creek from the cercustance of it's bottoms being composed\r\nof excellent turf. my air gun was out of order and her sights had been\r\nremoved by some accedent I put her in order and regulated her. she shot\r\nagain as well as she ever did. The clouds last night prevented my\r\ntaking any lunar observations this day I took Equal Altitudes of the 0\r\nwith Sextant.\r\n\r\nAt one oclock all our baggage was dry we therefore packed it up\r\nreloaded the canoes and the party proceeded with Capt. Clark up\r\nJefferson's river. I remained with Sergt. Gass to complete the\r\nobservation of equal altitudes and joined them in the evening at their\r\ncamp on the Lard. side just above the entrance of turf creek. we had a\r\nshower of rain wich continued about 40 minutes attended with thunder\r\nand lightning. this shower wet me perfectly before I reached the camp.\r\nthe clouds continued during the night in such manner that I was unable\r\nto obtain any lunar observations. This evening Drewyer brought in a\r\ndeer which he had killed. we have not heard any thing from Shannon yet,\r\nwe expect that he has pursued Wisdom river upwards for som distance\r\nprobably killed some heavy animal and is waiting our arrival. the large\r\nbiteing fly or hare fly as they sometimes called are very troublesome\r\nto us. I observe two kinds of them a large black species and a small\r\nbrown species with a green head. the musquetoes are not as troublesome\r\nas they were below, but are still in considerable quantities. the eye\r\nknats have disappeared. the green or blowing flies are still in swarms.\r\n\r\nr the courses from the entrance of Wisdom river to the forks of\r\nJefferson's river are taken directly to the objects mentioned and the\r\ndistance set down is that by land on a direct line between the points;\r\nthe estimated distances by water is also added in the body of the\r\nremarks on each course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 7, 1805]\r\nAugust 7th Wednesday 1805\r\na fine morning put out our Stores &c. to dry & took equal altitudes\r\nwith the Sextant,--as our Store were a little exorsted and one Canoe\r\nbecame unnecessary deturmind to leave one. we Hauled her up in the\r\nbushes on the lower Side of the main fork & fastened her So that the\r\nwater could not flote her off. The Countrey in this quarter is as\r\nfollows i, e a Vallie of 5 or 6 miles wide Inclosed between two high\r\nMountains, the bottom rich Some Small timber on the Islands & bushes on\r\nthe edges of the river Some Bogs & verry good turf in different places\r\nin the vallie, Some scattering Pine & ceder on the mountains in places,\r\nother Parts nacked except grass and Stone The Lattitude of the Mouth of\r\nWisdom River is 45° 2' 21.6\" North, we proceeded up the Main Middle or S.\r\nE. fork, passed a Camped on the Lard. Side above the mouth of a bold\r\nrunning Stream 12 yards wide, which we call turf Creek from the number\r\nof bogs & quanty of turf in its waters. this Creek runs thro a open\r\nPlain for Several miles, takeing its rise in a high mountain to the N\r\nE. The river Jefferson above Wisdom is gentle Crooked and about 40\r\nyards wide, Containing but little timber, Some few Cotton willow Willow\r\n& Birch, and the Srubs common to the countrey and before mentioned at 5\r\noClock a thunder Storm from the N. W. accompanied with rain which\r\nlasted about 40 minits.--despatched R Fields to hunt Shannon, who was\r\nout huntg. on Wisdom river at the time I returned down that Stream, and\r\nhas made on up the river expecting us to follow him up that river one\r\nDeer killed this evening. all those Streams Contain emence number of\r\nBeaver orter Muskrats &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 8, 1805]\r\nThursday August 8th 1805.\r\nWe had a heavy dew this morning. as one canoe had been left we had now\r\nmore hads to spear for the chase; game being scarce it requires more\r\nhunters to supply us. we therefore dispatched four this morning. we set\r\nout at sunrise and continued our rout up the river which we find much\r\nmore gentle and deep than below the entrance of Wisdom river it is from\r\n35 to 45 yards wide very crooked many short bends constituteing large\r\nand general bends; insomuch that altho we travel briskly and a\r\nconsiderable distance yet it takes us only a few miles on our general\r\ncourse or rout. there is but very little timber on this fork\r\nprincipally the under brush frequently mentioned. I observe a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the buffaloe clover in the bottoms. the\r\nsunflower, flax, green swoard, thistle and several species of the rye\r\ngrass some of which rise to the hight of 3 or 4 feet. there is a grass\r\nalso with a soft smooth leaf that bears it's seeds very much like the\r\ntimothy but it dose not grow very luxouriant or appear as if it would\r\nanswer so well as the common timothy for meadows. I preserved some of\r\nit's seeds which are now ripe, thinking perhaps it might answer better\r\nif cultivated, at all events is at least worth the experi-ment. it\r\nrises about 3 feet high. on a direct line about 2 miles above our\r\nencampment of this morning we passed the entrance of Philanthrophy\r\nRiver which discharges itself by 2 channels a small distance assunder.\r\nthis river from it's size and S. Eastwardly course no doubt heads with\r\nMadisons river in the snowey mountains visible in that direction. at\r\nNoon Reubin Fields arrived and reported that he had been up Wisdom\r\nriver some miles above where it entered the mountain and could find\r\nnothing of Shannon, he had killed a deer and an Antelope. great\r\nquantity of beaver Otter and musk-rats in these rivers. two of the\r\nhunters we sent out this morning returned at noon had killed each a\r\ndeer and an Antelope. we use the seting poles today almost altogether.\r\nwe encamped on the Lard sides where there was but little timber were\r\nobliged to use willow brush for fuel; the rosebushes and bryers were\r\nvery thick. the hunters brought in another deer this evening. to tumor\r\non Capt. Clarks ankle has discharged a considerable quantity of matter\r\nbut is still much swolen and inflamed and gives him considerable pain.\r\nsaw a number of Gees ducks and some Crains today. the former begin to\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nthe evening again proved cloudy much to my mortification and prevented\r\nmy making any lunar observations. the Indian woman recognized the point\r\nof a high plain to our right which she informed us was not very distant\r\nfrom the summer retreat of her nation on a river beyond the mountains\r\nwhich runs to the west. this hill she says her nation calls the\r\nbeaver's head from a conceived remblance of it's figure to the head of\r\nthat animal. she assures us that we shall either find her people on\r\nthis river or on the river immediately west of it's source; which from\r\nit's present size cannot be very distant. as it is now all important\r\nwith us to meet with those people as soon as possible, I determined to\r\nproceed tomorrow with a small party to the source of the principal\r\nstream of this river and pass the mountains to the Columbia; and down\r\nthat river untill I found the Indians; in short it is my resolusion to\r\nfind them or some others, who have horses if it should cause me a trip\r\nof one month. for without horses we shall be obliged to leave a great\r\npart of our stores, of which, it appears to me that we have a stock\r\nalready sufficiently small for the length of the voyage before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 8, 1805]\r\nAugust 8th Thursday 1805\r\nWe proceeded on early wind from the S W. The Thermometer at 52 a 0 at\r\nSunrise at 5 miles by water & 41/2 on a derect line from the forks we\r\npassed a River on the Lard Side 30 yards wide and navagable for Some\r\ndistance takeing its rise in the Mountains Easterly & with the waters\r\nof Madisons River, passes thro an extensive vallie open & furtill &c.\r\nthis river we call Philanthophy--above this river (which has but little\r\ntimber) Jeffersons R is crooked with Short bends a fiew Islands and\r\nmaney gravelly Sholes, no large timber, Small willow Birch & Srubs &c.\r\nEncamped on the Lard Side, R Fields joined us this eveng. & informes\r\nthat he could not find Shannon my foot yet verry Swore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 9, 1805]\r\nFriday August 9th 1805.\r\nThe morning was fair and fine; we set out at an early hour and\r\nproceeded on very well. some parts of the river more rapid than\r\nyesterday. I walked on shore across the land to a point which I\r\npresumed they would reach by 8 A.M. our usual time of halting. by this\r\nmeans I acquired leasure to accomplish some wrightings which I\r\nconceived from the nature of my instructions necessary lest any\r\naccedent should befall me on the long and reather hazardous rout I was\r\nnow about to take. the party did not arrive and I returned about a mile\r\nand met them, here they halted and we breakefasted; I had killed two\r\nfine gees on my return. while we halted here Shannon arrived, and\r\ninformed us that having missed the party the day on which he set out he\r\nhad returned the next morning to the place from whence he had set out\r\nor furst left them and not finding that he had supposed that they wer\r\nabove him; that he then set out and marched one day up wisdom river, by\r\nwhich time he was convinced that they were not above him as the river\r\ncould not be navigated; he then returned to the forks and had pursued\r\nus up this river. he brought the skins of three deer which he had\r\nkilled which he said were in good order. he had lived very plentifully\r\nthis trip but looked a good deel worried with his march. he informed us\r\nthat Wisdom river still kept it's course obliquely down the Jefferson's\r\nriver as far as he was up it. immediately after breakfast I slung my\r\npack and set out accompanyed by Drewyer Shields and McNeal who had been\r\npreviously directed to hold themselves in readiness for this service. I\r\ndirected my course across the bottom to the Stard. plain led left the\r\nbeaver's head about 2 miles to my left and interscepted the river about\r\n8 miles from the point at which I had left it; I then waded it and\r\ncontinued my rout to the point where I could observe that it entered\r\nthe mountain, but not being able to reach that place, changed my\r\ndirection to the river which I struck some miles below the mountain and\r\nencamped for the evening having traveled 16 M. we passed a handsom\r\nlittle stream formed by some large spring which rise in this wide\r\nbottom on the Lard. side of the river. we killed two Antelopes on our\r\nway and brought with us as much meat as was necessary for our suppers\r\nand breakfast the next morning. we found this bottom fertile and\r\ncovered with taller grass than usual. the river very crooked much\r\ndivided by islands, shallow rocky in many plases and very rapid;\r\ninsomuch that I have my doubts whether the canoes could get on or not,\r\nor if they do it must be with great labour.--Capt. Clark proceeded\r\nafter I left him as usual, found the current of the river increasing in\r\nrapidity towards evening. his hunters killed 2 antelopes only. in the\r\nevening it clouded up and we experienced a slight rain attended with\r\nsome thunder and lightning. the musquetoes very troublesome this\r\nevening. there are some soft bogs in these vallies covered with turf.\r\nthe earth of which this mud is composed is white or bluish white and\r\nappears to be argillacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 9, 1805]\r\nAugust 9th Friday 1805\r\na fine morning wind from the N. E we proceeded on verry well rapid\r\nplaces more noumerous than below, Shannon the man whome we lost on\r\nWisdom River Joined us, haveing returned to the forks & prosued us up\r\nafter prosueing Wisdom River one day\r\n\r\nCapt Lewis and 3 men Set out after brackft. to examine the river above,\r\nfind a portage if possible, also the Snake Indians. I Should have taken\r\nthis trip had I have been able to march, from the rageing fury of a\r\nturner on my anckle musle, in the evening Clouded up and a fiew drops\r\nof rain Encamped on the Lard Side near a low bluff, the river to day as\r\nyesterday. the three hunters Could kill only two antelopes to day, game\r\nof every kind Scerce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 10, 1805]\r\nSaturday August 10th 1805.\r\nWe set out very early this morning and continued our rout through the\r\nwide bottom on the Lard. side of the river after passing a large creek\r\nat about 5 miles we fel in with a plain Indian road which led towards\r\nthe point that the river entered the mountain we therefore pursued the\r\nroad I sent Drewyer to the wright to kill a deer which we saw feeding\r\nand halted on the river under an immencely high perpendicular clift of\r\nrocks where it entered the mountain here we kindled a fire and waited\r\nfor Drewyer. he arrived in about an hour and a half or at noon with\r\nthree deer skins and the flesh of one of the best of them, we cooked\r\nand eat a haisty meal and departed, returning a shot distance to the\r\nIndian road which led us the best way over the mountains, which are not\r\nvery high but ar ruggid and approach the river closely on both sides\r\njust below these mountains I saw several bald Eagles and two large\r\nwhite headed fishinghawks boath these birds were the same common to our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nfrom the number of rattle snakes about the Clifts at which we halted we\r\ncalled them the rattle snake clifts. this serpent is the same before\r\ndiscribed with oval spots of yellowish brown. the river below the\r\nmountains is rapid rocky, very crooked, much divided by islands and\r\nwithal shallow. after it enters the mountains it's bends are not so\r\ncircuetous and it's general course more direct, but it is equally\r\nshallow les divided more rocky and rapid. we continued our rout along\r\nthe Indian road which led us sometimes over the hills and again in the\r\nnarrow bottoms of the river till at the distance of fifteen Ms. from\r\nthe rattle snake Clifts we arrived in a hadsome open and leavel vally\r\nwhere the river divided itself nearly into two equal branches; here I\r\nhalted and examined those streams and readily discovered from their\r\nsize that it would be vain to attempt the navigation of either any\r\nfurther. here also the road forked one leading up the vally of each of\r\nthese streams. I therefore sent Drewer on one and Shields on the other\r\nto examine these roads for a short distance and to return and compare\r\ntheir information with respect to the size and apparent plainness of\r\nthe roads as I was now determined to pursue that which appeared to have\r\nbeen the most traveled this spring. in the mean time I wrote a note to\r\nCapt. Clark informing him of the occurrences which had taken place,\r\nrecommending it to him to halt at this place untill my return and\r\ninforming him of the rout I had taken which from the information of the\r\nmen on their return seemed to be in favour of the S W or Left hand fork\r\nwhich is reather the smallest. accordingly I put up my note on a dry\r\nwillow pole at the forks, and set out up the S. E. fork, after\r\nproceeding about 11/2 miles I discovered that the road became so blind\r\nthat it could not be that which we had followed to the forks of\r\nJefferson's river, neither could I find the tracks of the horses which\r\nhad passed early in the spring along the other; I therefore determined\r\nto return and examine the other myself, which I did, and found that the\r\nsame horses had passed up the West fork which was reather largest, and\r\nmore in the direction that I wished to pursue; I therefore did not\r\nhesitate about changing my rout but determined to take the western\r\nroad. I now wrote a second note to Capt C. informing him of this change\r\nand sent Drewyer to put it with the other at the forks and waited\r\nuntill he returned. there is scarcely any timber on the river above the\r\nR. Snake Clifts, nor is there anything larger than willow brush in\r\nsight of these forks. immediately in the level plain between the forks\r\nand about 1/2 a mile distance from them stands a high rocky mountain,\r\nthe base of which is surrounded by the level plain; it has a singular\r\nappearance. the mountains do not appear very high in any direction tho\r\nthe tops of some of them are partially covered with snow. this\r\nconvinces me that we have ascended to a great hight since we have\r\nentered the rocky Mountains, yet the ascent has been so gradual along\r\nthe vallies that it was scarcely perceptable by land. I do not beleive\r\nthat the world can furnish an example of a river runing to the extent\r\nwhich the Missouri and Jefferson's rivers do through such a mountainous\r\ncountry and at the same time so navigable as they are. if the Columbia\r\nfurnishes us such another example, a communication across the continent\r\nby water will be practicable and safe. but this I can scarcely hope\r\nfrom a knowledge of its having in it comparitively short course to the\r\nocean the same number of feet to decend which the Missouri and\r\nMississippi have from this point to the Gulph of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the west fork through which we passed for four miles boar\r\na little to N of West and was about 1 mile wide hemned in on either\r\nside by rough mountain and steep Clifts of rock at 41/2 miles this\r\nstream enters a beatifull and extensive plain about ten miles long and\r\nfrom 5 to six in width. this plain is surrounded on all sides by a\r\ncountry of roling or high wavy plains through which several little\r\nrivulets extend their wide vallies quite to the Mountains which\r\nsurround the whole in an apparent Circular manner; forming one of the\r\nhandsomest coves I ever saw, of about 16 or 18 miles in diameter. just\r\nafter entering this cove the river bends to the N. W. and runs close\r\nunder the Stard. hills. here we killed a deer and encamped on the\r\nStard.,side and made our fire of dry willow brush, the only fuel which\r\nthe country produces. there are not more than three or four cottonwood\r\ntrees in this extensive cove and they are but small. the uplands are\r\ncovered with prickly pears and twisted or bearded grass and are but\r\npoor; some parts of the bottom lands are covered with grass and\r\ntolerably fertile; but much the greater proportion is covered with\r\nprickly pears sedge twisted grass the pulpy leafed thorn southernwood\r\nwild sage &c and like the uplands is very inferior in point of soil. we\r\ntraveled by estimate 30 Ms. today, that is 10 to the Rattle snake\r\nClift, 15 to the forks of Jefferson's river and 5 to our camp in the\r\ncove. at the apparent extremity of the bottom above us two\r\nperpendicular clifts of considerable hight stand on either side of the\r\nriver and appers at this distance like a gate, it is about 10 M. due\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nCapt Clark set out at sunrise this morning and pursued his rout; found\r\nthe river not rapid but shallow also very crooked. they were obliged to\r\ndrag the canoes over many riffles in the course of the day. they passed\r\nthe point which the natives call the beaver's head. it is a steep rocky\r\nclift of 150 feet high near the Stard. side of the river, opposite to\r\nit at the distance of 300 yards is a low clift of about 50 feet which\r\nis the extremity of a spur of the mountains about 4 miles distant on\r\nLard. at 4 P.M. they experienced a heavy shower of rain attended with\r\nhail thunder and Lightning which continued about an hour. the men\r\ndefended themselves from the hail by means of the willow bushes but all\r\nthe party got perfectly wet. after the shower was over they pursued\r\ntheir march and encamped on the stard side only one deer killed by\r\ntheir hunters today. tho they took up another by the way which had been\r\nkilled three days before by Jos. Fields and hung up near the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 10, 1805]\r\nAugust 10th Satturday 1805\r\nSome rain this morning at Sun rise and Cloudy we proceeded on passed a\r\nremarkable Clift point on the Stard. Side about 150 feet high, this\r\nClift the Indians Call the Beavers head, opposit at 300 yards is a low\r\nclift of 50 feet which is a Spur from the Mountain on the Lard. about 4\r\nmiles, the river verry Crooked, at 4 oClock a hard rain from the S W\r\naccompanied with hail Continued half an hour, all wet, the men\r\nSheltered themselves from the hail with bushes We Encamped on the Stard\r\nSide near a Bluff, only one Deer killed to day, the one killed Jo\r\nFields 3 Days past & hung up we made use of river narrow, & Sholey but\r\nnot rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 11, 1805]\r\nSunday August 11th 1805.\r\nWe set out very early this morning; but the track which we had pursued\r\nlast evening soon disappeared. I therefore resolved to proceed to the\r\nnarrow pass on the creek about 10 miles West in hopes that I should\r\nagain find the Indian road at the place, accordingly I passed the river\r\nwhich was about 12 yards wide and bared in several places entirely\r\nacross by beaver dams and proceeded through the level plain directly to\r\nthe pass. I now sent Drewyer to keep near the creek to my right and\r\nShields to my left, with orders to surch for the road which if they\r\nfound they were to notify me by placing a hat in the muzzle of their\r\ngun. I kept McNeal with me; after having marched in this order for\r\nabout five miles I discovered an Indian on horse back about two miles\r\ndistant coming down the plain toward us. with my glass I discovered\r\nfrom his dress that he was of a different nation from any that we had\r\nyet seen, and was satisfyed of his being a Sosone; his arms were a bow\r\nand quiver of arrows, and was mounted on an eligant horse without a\r\nsaddle, and a small string which was attatched to the underjaw of the\r\nhorse which answered as a bridle. I was overjoyed at the sight of this\r\nstranger and had no doubt of obtaining a friendly introduction to his\r\nnation provided I could get near enough to him to convince him of our\r\nbeing whitemen. I therefore proceeded towards him at my usual pace.\r\nwhen I had arrived within about a mile he mad a halt which I did also\r\nand unloosing my blanket from my pack, I mad him the signal of\r\nfriendship known to the Indians of the Rocky mountains and those of the\r\nMissouri, which is by holding the mantle or robe in your hands at two\r\ncorners and then throwing up in the air higher than the head bringing\r\nit to the earth as if in the act of spreading it, thus repeating three\r\ntimes. this signal of the robe has arrisen from a custom among all\r\nthose nations of spreading a robe or skin for ther gests to set on when\r\nthey are visited. this signal had not the desired effect, he still kept\r\nhis position and seemed to view Drewyer an Shields who were now\r\ncomiming in sight on either hand with an air of suspicion, I wold\r\nwillingly have made them halt but they were too far distant to hear me\r\nand I feared to make any signal to them least it should increase the\r\nsuspicion in the mind of the Indian of our having some unfriendly\r\ndesign upon him. I therefore haistened to take out of my sack some\r\nbeads a looking glas and a few trinkets which I had brought with me for\r\nthis purpose and leaving my gun and pouch with McNeal advanced unarmed\r\ntowards him. he remained in the same stedfast poisture untill I arrived\r\nin about 200 paces of him when he turn his hose about and began to move\r\noff slowly from me; I now called to him in as loud a voice as I could\r\ncommand repeating the word tab-ba-bone, which in their language\r\nsignifyes white man. but loking over his sholder he still kept his eye\r\non Drewyer and Sheilds who wer still advancing neither of them haveing\r\nsegacity enough to recollect the impropriety of advancing when they saw\r\nme thus in parley with the Indian. I now made a signal to these men to\r\nhalt, Drewyer obeyed but Shields who afterwards told me that he did not\r\nobseve the signal still kept on the Indian halted again and turned his\r\nhorse about as if to wait for me, and I beleive he would have remained\r\nuntill I came up whith him had it not been for Shields who still\r\npressed forward. whe I arrived within about 150 paces I again\r\nrepepeated the word tab-ba-bone and held up the trinkits in my hands\r\nand striped up my shirt sieve to give him an opportunity of seeing the\r\ncolour of my skin and advanced leasure towards him but he did not\r\nremain untill I got nearer than about 100 paces when he suddonly turned\r\nhis hose about, gave him the whip leaped the creek and disapeared in\r\nthe willow brush in an instant and with him vanished all my hopes of\r\nobtaining horses for the preasent. I now felt quite as much\r\nmortification and disappointment as I had pleasure and expectation at\r\nthe first sight of this indian. I fet soarly chargrined at the conduct\r\nof the men particularly Sheilds to whom I principally attributed this\r\nfailure in obtaining an introduction to the natives. I now called the\r\nmen to me and could not forbare abraiding them a little for their want\r\nof attention and imprudence on this occasion. they had neglected to\r\nbring my spye-glass which in haist I had droped in the plain with the\r\nblanket where I made the signal before mentioned. I sent Drewyer and\r\nShields back to surche it, they soon found it and rejoined me. we now\r\nset out on the track of the horse hoping by that means to be lead to an\r\nindian camp, the trail of inhabitants of which should they abscond we\r\nshould probably be enabled to pursue to the body of the nation to which\r\nthey would most probably fly for safety. this rout led us across a\r\nlarge Island framed by nearly an equal division of the creek in this\r\nbottom; after passing to the open ground on the N. side of the creek we\r\nobserved that the track made out toward the high hills about 3 m.\r\ndistant in that direction. I thought it probable that their camp might\r\nprobably be among those hills & that they would reconnoiter us from the\r\ntops of them, and that if we advanced haistily towards them that they\r\nwould become allarmed and probably run off; I therefore halted in an\r\nelivated situation near the creek had a fire kindled of willow brush\r\ncooked and took breakfast. during this leasure I prepared a small\r\nassortment of trinkits consisting of some mockkerson awls a few strans\r\nof several kinds of beads some paint a looking glass &c which I\r\nattatched to the end of a pole and planted it near our fire in order\r\nthat should the Indians return in surch of us they might from this\r\ntoken discover that we were friendly and white persons. before we had\r\nfinised our meal a heavy shower of rain came on with some hail wich\r\ncontinued abot 20 minutes and wet us to the skin, after this shower we\r\npursued the track of the horse but as the rain had raised the grass\r\nwhich he had trodden down it was with difficulty that we could follow\r\nit. we pursued it however about 4 miles it turning up the valley to the\r\nleft under the foot of the hills. we pas several places where the\r\nIndians appeared to have been diging roots today and saw the fresh\r\ntracks of 8 or ten horses but they had been wandering about in such a\r\nconfused manner that we not only lost the track of the hose which we\r\nhad been pursuing but could make nothing of them. in the head of this\r\nvalley we passed a large bog covered with tall grass and moss in which\r\nwere a great number of springs of cold pure water, we now turned a\r\nlittle to the left along the foot of the high hills and arrived at a\r\nsmall branch on which we encamped for the night, having traveled in\r\ndifferent directions about 20 Miles and about 10 from the camp of last\r\nevening on a direct line. after meeting with the Indian today I fixed a\r\nsmall flag of the U'S. to a pole which I made McNeal carry. and planted\r\nin the ground where we halted or encamped.\r\n\r\nThis morning Capt Clark dispatched several hunters a head; the morning\r\nbeing rainy and wet did not set out untill after an early breakfast. he\r\npassed a large Island which he called the 3000 mile Island from the\r\ncircumstance of it's being that distance from the entrance of the\r\nMissouri by water. a considerable proportion of the bottom on Lard.\r\nside is a bog covered with tall grass and many parts would afford fine\r\nturf; the bottom is about 8 Ms. wide and the plains which succeed it on\r\neither side extend about the same distance to the base of the\r\nmountains. they passed a number of small Islands and bayous on both\r\nsides which cut and intersect the bottoms in various directions. found\r\nthe river shallow and rapid, insomuch that the men wer compelled to be\r\nin the water a considerable proportion of the day in drageing the\r\ncanoes over the shoals and riffles. they saw a number of geese ducks\r\nbeaver & otter, also some deer and antelopes. the men killed a beaver\r\nwith a seting pole and tommahawked several Otter. the hunters killed 3\r\ndeer and an Antelope. Capt. C. observed some bunches of privy near the\r\nriver. there are but few trees in this botom and those small narrow\r\nleafed Cottonwood. the principal growth is willow with the narrow leaf\r\nand Currant bushes. they encamped this evening on the upper point of a\r\nlarge Island near the Stard. shore.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 11, 1805]\r\nAugust 11th Sunday 1805.\r\na Shower of rain this morning at Sun rise, Cloudy all the morning wind\r\nfrom the S W passed a large Island which I call the 3000 mile Island as\r\nit is Situated that distance from the mouth of the Missouri by water, a\r\nnumber of Small Bayoes running in different directions thro the Bottom,\r\nwhich is about 5 miles wide, then rises to an ellivated plain on each\r\nSide which extends as far. passed Several Small Islands and a number of\r\nBayoes on each Side and Encamped on the upper point of a large Island,\r\nour hunters killed three Deer, one antilope, and Tomahawked Several\r\nOrter to day killed one Beaver with a Setting pole. I observed Some\r\nbunches of Privey on the banks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 12, 1805]\r\nMonday August 12th 1805\r\nThis morning I sent Drewyer out as soon as it was light, to try and\r\ndiscover what rout the Indians had taken. he followed the track of the\r\nhorse we had pursued yesterday to the mountain wher it had ascended,\r\nand returned to me in about an hour and a half. I now determined to\r\npursue the base of the mountains which form this cove to the S. W. in\r\nthe expectation of finding some Indian road which lead over the\r\nMountains, accordingly I sent Drewyer to my right and Shields to my\r\nleft with orders to look out for a road or the fresh tracks of horses\r\neither of which we should first meet with I had determined to pursue.\r\nat the distance of about 4 miles we passed 4 small rivulets near each\r\nother on which we saw som resent bowers or small conic lodges formed\r\nwith willow brush. near them the indians had geathered a number of\r\nroots from the manner in which they had toarn up the ground; but I\r\ncould not discover the root which they seemed to be in surch of. I saw\r\nseveral large hawks that were nearly black near this place we fell in\r\nwith a large and plain Indian road which came into the cove from the N.\r\nE. and led along the foot of the mountains to the S. W. oliquely\r\napproaching the main stream which we had left yesterday. this road we\r\nnow pursued to the S. W. at 5 miles it passed a stout stream which is a\r\nprincipal fork of the man stream and falls into it just above the\r\nnarrow pass between the two clifts before mentioned and which we now\r\nsaw below us. here we halted and breakfasted on the last of our\r\nvenison, having yet a small peice of pork in reseve. after eating we\r\ncontinued our rout through the low bottom of the main stream along the\r\nfoot of the mountains on our right the valley for 5 mes. further in a\r\nS. W. direction was from 2 to 3 miles wide the main stream now after\r\ndiscarding two stream on the left in this valley turns abruptly to the\r\nWest through a narrow bottom betwen the mountains. the road was still\r\nplain, I therefore did not dispair of shortly finding a passage over\r\nthe mountains and of taisting the waters of the great Columbia this\r\nevening. we saw an animal which we took to be of the fox kind as large\r\nor reather larger than the small wolf of the plains. it's colours were\r\na curious mixture of black, redis-brown and yellow. Drewyer shot at him\r\nabout 130 yards and knocked him dow bet he recovered and got out of our\r\nreach. it is certainly a different animal from any that we have yet\r\nseen. we also saw several of the heath cock with a long pointed tail\r\nand an uniform dark brown colour but could not kill one of them. they\r\nare much larger than the common dunghill fowls, and in their habits and\r\nmanner of flying resemble the growse or prarie hen. at the distance of\r\n4 miles further the road took us to the most distant fountain of the\r\nwaters of the mighty Missouri in surch of which we have spent so many\r\ntoilsome days and wristless nights. thus far I had accomplished one of\r\nthose great objects on which my mind has been unalterably fixed for\r\nmany years, judge then of the pleasure I felt in allying my thirst with\r\nthis pure and ice cold water which issues from the base of a low\r\nmountain or hill of a gentle ascent for 1/2 a mile. the mountains are\r\nhigh on either hand leave this gap at the head of this rivulet through\r\nwhich the road passes. here I halted a few minutes and rested myself.\r\ntwo miles below McNeal had exultingly stood with a foot on each side of\r\nthis little rivulet and thanked his god that he had lived to bestride\r\nthe mighty & heretofore deemed endless Missouri. after refreshing\r\nourselves we proceeded on to the top of the dividing ridge from which I\r\ndiscovered immence ranges of high mountains still to the West of us\r\nwith their tops partially covered with snow. I now decended the\r\nmountain about 3/4 of a mile which I found much steeper than on the\r\nopposite side, to a handsome bold running Creek of cold Clear water.\r\nhere I first tasted the water of the great Columbia river. after a\r\nshort halt of a few minutes we continued our march along the Indian\r\nroad which lead us over steep hills and deep hollows to a spring on the\r\nside of a mountain where we found a sufficient quantity of dry willow\r\nbrush for fuel, here we encamped for the night having traveled about 20\r\nMiles. as we had killed nothing during the day we now boiled and eat\r\nthe remainder of our pork, having yet a little flour and parched meal.\r\nat the creek on this side of the mountain I observed a species of deep\r\nperple currant lower in its growth, the stem more branched and leaf\r\ndoubly as large as that of the Missouri. the leaf is covered on it's\r\nunder disk with a hairy pubersence. the fruit is of the ordinary size\r\nand shape of the currant and is supported in the usual manner, but is\r\nascid & very inferior in point of flavor.\r\n\r\nthis morning Capt. Clark set out early. found the river shoally, rapid\r\nshallow, and extreemly difficult. the men in the water almost all day.\r\nthey are geting weak soar and much fortiegued; they complained of the\r\nfortiegue to which the navigation subjected them and wished to go by\r\nland Capt. C. engouraged them and passifyed them. one of the canoes was\r\nvery near overseting in a rapid today. they proceeded but slowly. at\r\nnoon they had a thunderstorm which continued about half an hour. their\r\nhunters killed 3 deer and a fawn. they encamped in a smoth plain near a\r\nfew cottonwood trees on the Lard. side.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 12, 1805]\r\nAugust 12th Monday 1805\r\nWe Set out early (Wind N E) proceeded on passed Several large Islands\r\nand three Small ones, the river much more Sholey than below which\r\nobliges us to haul the Canoes over those Sholes which Suckceed each\r\nother at Short intervales emencely laborious men much fatigued and\r\nweakened by being continualy in the water drawing the Canoes over the\r\nSholes encamped on the Lard Side men complain verry much of the emence\r\nlabour they are obliged to undergo & wish much to leave the river. I\r\npassify them. the weather Cool, and nothing to eate but venison, the\r\nhunters killed three Deer to day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 13, 1805]\r\nTuesday August 13th 1805.\r\nWe set out very early on the Indian road which still led us through an\r\nopen broken country in a westerly direction. a deep valley appeared to\r\nour left at the base of a high range of mountains which extended from\r\nS. E. to N. W. having their sides better clad with pine timber than we\r\nhad been accustomed to see the mountains and their tops were also\r\npartially covered with snow. at the distance of five miles the road\r\nafter leading us down a long decending valley for 2 Ms. brought us to a\r\nlarge creek about 10 yds. wide; this we passed and on rising the hill\r\nbeyond it had a view of a handsome little valley to our left of about a\r\nmile in width through which from the appearance of the timber I\r\nconjectured that a river passed. I saw near the creek some bushes of\r\nthe white maple, the shumate of the small species with the winged rib,\r\nand a species of honeysuckle much in it's growth and leaf like the\r\nsmall honeysuckle of the Missouri only reather larger and bears a\r\nglobular berry as large as a garden pea and as white as wax. this berry\r\nis formed of a thin smooth pellicle which envellopes a soft white\r\nmusilagenous substance in which there are several small brown seed\r\nirregularly scattered or intermixed without any sell or perceptable\r\nmembranous covering.--we had proceeded about four miles through a wavy\r\nplain parallel to the valley or river bottom when at the distance of\r\nabout a mile we saw two women, a man and some dogs on an eminence\r\nimmediately before us. they appeared to vew us with attention and two\r\nof them after a few minutes set down as if to wait our arrival we\r\ncontinued our usual pace towards them. when we had arrived within half\r\na mile of them I directed the party to halt and leaving my pack and\r\nrifle I took the flag which I unfurled and avanced singly towards them\r\nthe women soon disappeared behind the hill, the man continued untill I\r\narrived within a hundred yards of him and then likewise absconded. tho\r\nI frequently repeated the word tab-ba-bone sufficiently loud for him to\r\nhave heard it. I now haistened to the top of the hill where they had\r\nstood but could see nothing of them. the dogs were less shye than their\r\nmasters they came about me pretty close I therefore thought of tying a\r\nhandkerchief about one of their necks with some beads and other\r\ntrinkets and then let them loose to surch their fugitive owners\r\nthinking by this means to convince them of our pacific disposition\r\ntowards them but the dogs would not suffer me to take hold of them;\r\nthey also soon disappeared. I now made a signal fror the men to come\r\non, they joined me and we pursued the back tarck of these Indians which\r\nlead us along the same road which we had been traveling. the road was\r\ndusty and appeared to have been much traveled lately both by men and\r\nhorses. these praries are very poor the soil is of a light yellow clay,\r\nintermixed with small smooth gravel, and produces little else but\r\nprickly pears, and bearded grass about 3 inches high. the prickley pear\r\nare of three species that with a broad leaf common to the missouri;\r\nthat of a globular form also common to the upper part of the Missouri\r\nand more especially after it enters the Rocky Mountains, also a 3rd\r\npeculiar to this country. it consists of small circular thick leaves\r\nwith a much greater number of thorns. these thorns are stronger and\r\nappear to be barbed. the leaves grow from the margins of each other as\r\nin the broad leafed pear of the missouri, but are so slightly attatched\r\nthat when the thorn touches your mockerson it adhears and brings with\r\nit the leaf covered in every direction with many others. this is much\r\nthe most troublesome plant of the three. we had not continued our rout\r\nmore than a mile when we were so fortunate as to meet with three female\r\nsavages. the short and steep ravines which we passed concealed us from\r\neach other untill we arrived within 30 paces. a young woman immediately\r\ntook to flight, an Elderly woman and a girl of about 12 years old\r\nremained. I instantly laid by my gun and advanced towards them. they\r\nappeared much allarmed but saw that we were to near for them to escape\r\nby flight they therefore seated themselves on the ground, holding down\r\ntheir heads as if reconciled to die which the expected no doubt would\r\nbe their fate; I took the elderly woman by the hand and raised her up\r\nrepeated the word tab-babone and strip up my shirt sieve to sew her my\r\nskin; to prove to her the truth of the ascertion that I was a white man\r\nfor my face and hads which have been constantly exposed to the sun were\r\nquite as dark as their own. they appeared instantly reconciled, and the\r\nmen coming up I gave these women some beads a few mockerson awls some\r\npewter looking-glasses and a little paint. I directed Drewyer to\r\nrequest the old woman to recall the young woman who had run off to some\r\ndistance by this time fearing she might allarm the camp before we\r\napproached and might so exasperate the natives that they would perhaps\r\nattack us without enquiring who we were. the old woman did as she was\r\nrequested and the fugitive soon returned almost out of breath. I\r\nbestoed an equvolent portion of trinket on her with the others. I now\r\npainted their tawny cheeks with some vermillion which with this nation\r\nis emblematic of peace. after they had become composed I informed them\r\nby signs that I wished them to conduct us to their camp that we wer\r\nanxious to become acquainted with the chiefs and warriors of their\r\nnation. they readily obeyed and we set out, still pursuing the road\r\ndown the river. we had marched about 2 miles when we met a party of\r\nabout 60 warriors mounted on excellent horses who came in nearly full\r\nspeed, when they arrived I advanced towards them with the flag leaving\r\nmy gun with the party about 50 paces behid me. the chief and two others\r\nwho were a little in advance of the main body spoke to the women, and\r\nthey informed them who we were and exultingly shewed the presents which\r\nhad been given them these men then advanced and embraced me very\r\naffectionately in their way which is by puting their left arm over you\r\nwright sholder clasping your back, while they apply their left cheek to\r\nyours and frequently vociforate the word ah-hi'-e, &h-hi'-e that is, I\r\nam much pleased, I am much rejoiced. bothe parties now advanced and we\r\nwer all carresed and besmeared with their grease and paint till I was\r\nheartily tired of the national hug. I now had the pipe lit and gave\r\nthem smoke; they seated themselves in a circle around us and pulled of\r\ntheir mockersons before they would receive or smoke the pipe. this is a\r\ncustom among them as I afterwards learned indicative of a sacred\r\nobligation of sincerity in their profession of friendship given by the\r\nact of receiving and smoking the pipe of a stranger. or which is as\r\nmuch as to say that they wish they may always go bearfoot if they are\r\nnot sincere; a pretty heavy penalty if they are to march through the\r\nplains of their country. after smoking a few pipes with them I\r\ndistributed some trifles among them, with which they seemed much\r\npleased particularly with the blue beads and vermillion. I now informed\r\nthe chief that the object of our visit was a friendly one, that after\r\nwe should reach his camp I would undertake to explain to him fully\r\nthose objects, who we wer, from whence we had come and wither we were\r\ngoing; that in the mean time I did not care how soon we were in motion,\r\nas the sun was very warm and no water at hand. they now put on their\r\nmockersons, and the principal chief Ca-me-ah-wait made a short speach\r\nto the warriors. I gave him the flag which I informed him was an emblem\r\nof peace among whitemen and now that it had been received by him it was\r\nto be respected as the bond of union between us. I desired him to march\r\non, which did and we followed him; the dragoons moved on in squadron in\r\nour rear. after we had marched about a mile in this order he halted\r\nthem ang gave a second harang; after which six or eight of the young\r\nmen road forward to their encampment and no further regularity was\r\nobserved in the order of march. I afterwards understood that the\r\nIndians we had first seen this morning had returned and allarmed the\r\ncamp; these men had come out armed cap a pe for action expecting to\r\nmeet with their enemies the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie whome they\r\nCall Rah'-kees. they were armed with bows arrow and Shield except three\r\nwhom I observed with small pieces such as the N. W. Company furnish the\r\nnatives with which they had obtained from the Rocky Mountain Indians on\r\nthe yellow stone river with whom they are at peace. on our arrival at\r\ntheir encampmen on the river in a handsome level and fertile bottom at\r\nthe distance of 4 Ms. from where we had first met them they introduced\r\nus to a londge made of willow brush and an old leather lodge which had\r\nbeen prepared for our reception by the young men which the chief had\r\ndispatched for that purpose. Here we were seated on green boughs and\r\nthe skins of Antelopes. one of the warriors then pulled up the grass in\r\nthe center of the lodge forming a smal circle of about 2 feet in\r\ndiameter the chief next produced his pipe and native tobacco and began\r\na long cerimony of the pipe when we were requested to take of our\r\nmockersons, the Chief having previously taken off his as well as all\r\nthe warriors present. this we complyed with; the Chief then lit his\r\npipe at the fire kindled in this little magic circle, and standing on\r\nthe oposite side of the circle uttered a speach of several minutes in\r\nlength at the conclusion of which he pointed the stem to the four\r\ncardinal points of the heavens first begining at the East and ending\r\nwith the North. he now presented the pipe to me as if desirous that I\r\nshould smoke, but when I reached my hand to receive it, he drew it back\r\nand repeated the same cremony three times, after which he pointed the\r\nstern first to the heavens then to the center of the magic circle\r\nsmoked himself with three whifs and held the pipe untill I took as many\r\nas I thought proper; he then held it to each of the white persons and\r\nthen gave it to be consumed by his warriors. this pipe was made of a\r\ndense simitransparent green stone very highly polished about 21/2\r\ninches long and of an oval figure, the bowl being in the same direction\r\nwith the stem. a small piece of birned clay is placed in the bottom of\r\nthe bowl to seperate the tobacco from the end of the stem and is of an\r\nirregularly rounded figure not fitting the tube purfectly close in\r\norder that the smoke may pass. this is the form of the pipe. their\r\ntobacco is of the same kind of that used by the Minnetares Mandans and\r\nRicares of the Missouri. the Shoshonees do not cultivate this plant,\r\nbut obtain it from the Rocky mountain Indians and some of the bands of\r\ntheir own nation who live further south. I now explained to them the\r\nobjects of our journey &c. all the women and children of the camp were\r\nshortly collected about the lodge to indulge themselves with looking at\r\nus, we being the first white persons they had ever seen. after the\r\ncerimony of the pipe was over I distributed the remainder of the small\r\narticles I had brought with me among the women and children. by this\r\ntime it was late in the evening and we had not taisted any food since\r\nthe evening before. the Chief informed us that they had nothing but\r\nberries to eat and gave us some cakes of serviceberries and Choke\r\ncherries which had been dryed in the sun; of these I made a hearty\r\nmeal, and then walked to the river, which I found about 40 yards wide\r\nvery rapid clear and about 3 feet deep. the banks low and abrupt as\r\nthose of the upper part of the Missouri, and the bed formed of loose\r\nstones and gravel. Cameahwait informed me that this stream discharged\r\nitself into another doubly as large at the distance of half a days\r\nmarch which came from the S. W. but he added on further enquiry that\r\nthere was but little more timber below the junction of those rivers\r\nthan I saw here, and that the river was confined between inacessable\r\nmountains, was very rapid and rocky insomuch that it was impossible for\r\nus to pass either by land or water down this river to the great lake\r\nwhere the white men lived as he had been informed. this was unwelcome\r\ninformation but I still hoped that this account had been exagerated\r\nwith a view to detain us among them. as to timber I could discover not\r\nany that would answer the purpose of constructing canoes or in short\r\nmore than was bearly necessary for fuel consisting of the narrow leafed\r\ncottonwood and willow, also the red willow Choke Cherry service berry\r\nand a few currant bushes such as were common on the Missouri. these\r\npeople had been attacked by the Minetares of Fort de prarie this spring\r\nand about 20 of them killed and taken prisoners. on this occasion they\r\nlost a great part of their horses and all their lodges except that\r\nwhich they had erected for our accomodation; they were now living in\r\nlodges of a conic figure made of willow brush. I still observe a great\r\nnumber of horses feeding in every direction around their camp and\r\ntherefore entertain but little doubt but we shall be enable to furnish\r\nourselves with an adiquate number to transport our stores even if we\r\nare compelled to travel by land over these mountains. on my return to\r\nmy lodge an indian called me in to his bower and gave me a small morsel\r\nof the flesh of an antelope boiled, and a peice of a fresh salmon\r\nroasted; both which I eat with a very good relish. this was the first\r\nsalmon I had seen and perfectly convinced me that we were on the waters\r\nof the Pacific Ocean. the course of this river is a little to the North\r\nof west as far as I can discover it; and is bounded on each side by a\r\nrange of high Mountains. tho those on the E. side are lowest and more\r\ndistant from the river.\r\n\r\nThis evening the Indians entertained us with their dancing nearly all\r\nnight. at 12 O'Ck. I grew sleepy and retired to rest leaving the men to\r\namuse themselves with the Indians. I observe no essential difference\r\nbetween the music and manner of dancing among this nation and those of\r\nthe Missouri. I was several times awoke in the course of the night by\r\ntheir yells but was too much fortiegued to be deprived of a tolerable\r\nsound night's repose.\r\n\r\nThis morning Capt Clark set out early having previously dispatched some\r\nhunters ahead. it was cool and cloudy all the forepart of the day. at 8\r\nA.M. they had a slight rain. they passed a number of shoals over which\r\nthey were obliged to drag the canoes; the men in the water 3/4ths of\r\nthe day, they passed a bold runing stream 7 yds. wide on the Lard. side\r\njust below a high point of Limestone rocks. this stream we call\r\nMcNeal's Creek after Hugh McNeal one of our party. this creek heads in\r\nthe Mountains to the East and forms a handsome valley for some miles\r\nbetween the mountains. from the top of this limestone Clift above the\r\ncreek The beaver's head boar N 24° E. 12 Ms. the course of Wisdom river\r\nor that which the opening of it's valley makes through the mountains is\r\nN. 25 W. to the gap through which Jefferson's river enters the\r\nmountains above is S 18° W 10 M. they killed one deer only today. saw a\r\nnumber of Otter some beaver Antelopes ducks gees and Grains. they\r\ncaught a number of fine trout as they have every day since I left them.\r\nthey encamped on Lrd. in a smooth level prarie near a few cottonwood\r\ntrees, but were obliged to make use of the dry willow brush for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 13, 1805]\r\nAugust 13th Tuesday 1805\r\na verry Cool morning the Thermometer Stood at 52 a 0 all the fore part\r\nof the day.

Clark time to reach the forks of Jefferson's\r\nriver I concluded to spend this day at the Shoshone Camp and obtain\r\nwhat information I could with rispect to the country. as we had nothing\r\nbut a little flour and parched meal to eat except the berries with\r\nwhich the Indians furnished us I directed Drewyer and Shields to hunt a\r\nfew hours and try to kill something, the Indians furnished them with\r\nhorses and most of their young men also turned out to hunt. the game\r\nwhich they principally hunt is the Antelope which they pursue on\r\nhorseback and shoot with their arrows. this animal is so extreemly\r\nfleet and dureable that a single horse has no possible chance to\r\novertake them or run them down. the Indians are therefore obliged to\r\nhave recorce to strategem when they discover a herd of the Antelope\r\nthey seperate and scatter themselves to the distance of five or six\r\nmiles in different directions arround them generally scelecting some\r\ncommanding eminence for a stand; some one or two now pursue the herd at\r\nfull speed over the hills values gullies and the sides of precipices\r\nthat are tremendious to view. thus after runing them from five to six\r\nor seven miles the fresh horses that were in waiting head them and\r\ndrive them back persuing them as far or perhaps further quite to the\r\nother extreem of the hunters who now in turn pursue on their fresh\r\nhorses thus worrying the poor animal down and finally killing them with\r\ntheir arrows. forty or fifty hunters will be engaged for half a day in\r\nthis manner and perhaps not kill more than two or three Antelopes. they\r\nhave but few Elk or black tailed deer, and the common red deer they\r\ncannot take as they secrete themselves in the brush when pursued, and\r\nthey have only the bow and arrow wich is a very slender dependence for\r\nkilling any game except such as they can run down with their horses. I\r\nwas very much entertained with a view of this indian chase; it was\r\nafter a herd of about 10 Antelope and about 20 hunters. it lasted about\r\n2 hours and considerable part of the chase in view from my tent. about\r\n1 A.M. the hunters returned had not killed a single Antelope, and their\r\nhorses foaming with sweat. my hunters returned soon after and had been\r\nequally unsuccessfull. I now directed McNeal to make me a little paist\r\nwith the flour and added some berries to it which I found very\r\npallateable.\r\n\r\nThe means I had of communicating with these people was by way of\r\nDrewyer who understood perfectly the common language of jesticulation\r\nor signs which seems to be universally understood by all the Nations we\r\nhave yet seen. it is true that this language is imperfect and liable to\r\nerror but is much less so than would be expected. the strong parts of\r\nthe ideas are seldom mistaken.\r\n\r\nI now prevailed on the Chief to instruct me with rispect to the\r\ngeography of his country. this he undertook very cheerfully, by\r\ndelienating the rivers on the ground. but I soon found that his\r\ninformation fell far short of my expectation or wishes. he drew the\r\nriver on which we now are to which he placed two branches just above\r\nus, which he shewed me from the openings of the mountains were in view;\r\nhe next made it discharge itself into a large river which flowed from\r\nthe S. W. about ten miles below us, then continued this joint stream in\r\nthe same direction of this valley or N. W. for one days march and then\r\nenclined it to the West for 2 more days march, here he placed a number\r\nof beeps of sand on each side which he informed me represented the vast\r\nmountains of rock eternally covered with snow through which the river\r\npassed. that the perpendicular and even juting rocks so closely hemned\r\nin the river that there was no possibilyte of passing along the shore;\r\nthat the bed of the river was obstructed by sharp pointed rocks and the\r\nrapidity of the stream such that the whole surface of the river was\r\nbeat into perfect foam as far as the eye could reach. that the\r\nmountains were also inaccessible to man or horse. he said that this\r\nbeing the state of the country in that direction that himself nor none\r\nof his nation had ever been further down the river than these\r\nmountains. I then enquired the state of the country on either side of\r\nthe river but he could not inform me. he said there was an old man of\r\nhis nation a days march below who could probably give me some\r\ninformation of the country to the N. W. and refered me to an old man\r\nthen present for that to the S. W.--the Chief further informed me that\r\nhe had understood from the persed nosed Indians who inhabit this river\r\nbelow the rocky mountains that it ran a great way toward the seting sun\r\nand finally lost itself in a great lake of water which was illy\r\ntaisted, and where the white men lived. I next commenced my enquiries\r\nof the old man to whom I had been refered for information relative the\r\ncountry S W. of us. this he depicted with horrors and obstructions\r\nscarcely inferior to that just mentioned. he informed me that the band\r\nof this nation to which he belonged resided at the distance of 20 days\r\nmarch from hence not far from the white people with whom they traded\r\nfor horses mules cloth metal beads and the shells which they woar as\r\norniment being those of a species of perl oister. that the course to\r\nhis relations was a little to the West of South. that in order to get\r\nto his relations the first seven days we should be obliged to climb\r\nover steep and rocky mountains where we could find no game to kill nor\r\nanything but roots such as a ferce and warlike nation lived on whom he\r\ncalled the broken mockersons or mockersons with holes, and said\r\ninhabited those mountains and lived like the bear of other countries\r\namong the rocks and fed on roots or the flesh of such horses as they\r\ncould take or steel from those who passed through their country. that\r\nin passing this country the feet of our horses would be so much wounded\r\nwith the stones many of them would give out. the next part of the rout\r\nwas about 10 days through a dry and parched sandy desert in which no\r\nfood at this season for either man or horse, and in which we must\r\nsuffer if not perish for the want of water. that the sun had now dryed\r\nup the little pools of water which exist through this desert plain in\r\nthe spring season and had also scorched all the grass. that no animal\r\ninhabited this plain on which we could hope to subsist. that about the\r\ncenter of this plain a large river passed from S. E. to N. W. which was\r\nnavigable but afforded neither Salmon nor timber. that beyond this\r\nplain thee or four days march his relations lived in a country\r\ntolerable fertile and partially covered with timber on another large\r\nriver which ran in the same direction of the former. that this last\r\ndischarged itself into a large river on which many numerous nations\r\nlived with whom his relations were at war but whether this last\r\ndischarged itself into the great lake or not he did not know. that from\r\nhis relations it was yet a great distance to the great or stinking lake\r\nas they call the Ocean. that the way which such of his nation as had\r\nbeen to the Stinking lake traveled was up the river on which they lived\r\nand over to that on which the white people lived which last they knew\r\ndischarged itself into the Ocean, and that this was the way which he\r\nwould advise me to travel if I was determined to proceed to the Ocean\r\nbut would advise me to put off the journey untill the next spring when\r\nhe would conduct me. I thanked him for his information and advise and\r\ngave him a knife with which he appeared to be much gratifyed. from this\r\nnarative I was convinced that the streams of which he had spoken as\r\nruning through the plains and that on which his relations lived were\r\nsouthern branches of the Columbia, heading with the rivers Apostles and\r\nCollorado, and that the rout he had pointed out was to the Vermillion\r\nSea or gulph of Callifornia. I therefore told him that this rout was\r\nmore to the South than I wished to travel, and requested to know if\r\nthere was no rout on the left of this river on which we now are, by\r\nmeans of which, I could intercept it below the mountains through which\r\nit passes; but he could not inform me of any except that of the barren\r\nplain which he said joined the mountain on that side and through which\r\nit was impossible for us to pass at this season even if we were\r\nfortunate enough to escape from the broken mockerson Indians. I now\r\nasked Cameahwait by what rout the Pierced nosed indians, who he\r\ninformed me inhabited this river below the mountains, came over to the\r\nMissouri; this he informed me was to the north, but added that the road\r\nwas a very bad one as he had been informed by them and that they had\r\nsuffered excessively with hunger on the rout being obliged to subsist\r\nfor many days on berries alone as there was no game in that part of the\r\nmountains which were broken rockey and so thickly covered with timber\r\nthat they could scarcely pass. however knowing that Indians had passed,\r\nand did pass, at this season on that side of this river to the same\r\nbelow the mountains, my rout was instantly settled in my own mind,\r\npovided the account of this river should prove true on an investigation\r\nof it, which I was determined should be made before we would undertake\r\nthe rout by land in any direction. I felt perfectly satisfyed, that if\r\nthe Indians could pass these mountains with their women and Children,\r\nthat we could also pass them; and that if the nations on this river\r\nbelow the mountains were as numerous as they were stated to be that\r\nthey must have some means of subsistence which it would be equally in\r\nour power to procure in the same country. they informed me that there\r\nwas no buffaloe on the West side of these mountains; that the game\r\nconsisted of a few Elk deer and Antelopes, and that the natives\r\nsubsisted on fish and roots principally. in this manner I spent the day\r\nsmoking with them and acquiring what information I could with respect\r\nto their country. they informed me that they could pass to the\r\nSpaniards by the way of the yellowstone river in 10 days. I can\r\ndiscover that these people are by no means friendly to the Spaniard\r\ntheir complaint is, that the Spaniards will not let them have fire arms\r\nand amunition, that they put them off by telling them that if they\r\nsuffer them to have guns they will kill each other, thus leaving them\r\ndefenceless and an easy prey to their bloodthirsty neighbours to the\r\nEast of them, who being in possession of fire arms hunt them up and\r\nmurder them without rispect to sex or age and plunder them of their\r\nhorses on all occasions. they told me that to avoid their enemies who\r\nwere eternally harrassing them that they were obliged to remain in the\r\ninterior of these mountains at least two thirds of the year where the\r\nsuffered as we then saw great heardships for the want of food sometimes\r\nliving for weeks without meat and only a little fish roots and berries.\r\nbut this added Cameahwait, with his ferce eyes and lank jaws grown\r\nmeager for the want of food, would not be the case if we had guns, we\r\ncould then live in the country of buffaloe and eat as our enimies do\r\nand not be compelled to hide ourselves in these mountains and live on\r\nroots and berries as the bear do. we do not fear our enimies when\r\nplaced on an equal footing with them. I told them that the Minnetares\r\nMandans & Recares of the Missouri had promised us to desist from making\r\nwar on them & that we would indevour to find the means of making the\r\nMinnetares of fort d Prarie or as they call them Pahkees desist from\r\nwaging war against them also. that after our finally returning to our\r\nhomes towards the rising sun whitemen would come to them with an\r\nabundance of guns and every other article necessary to their defence\r\nand comfort, and that they would be enabled to supply themselves with\r\nthese articles on reasonable terms in exchange for the skins of the\r\nbeaver Otter and Ermin so abundant in their country. they expressed\r\ngreat pleasure at this information and said they had been long anxious\r\nto see the whitemen that traded guns; and that we might rest assured of\r\ntheir friendship and that they would do whatever we wished them.\r\n\r\nI now told Cameahwait that I wished him to speak to his people and\r\nengage them to go with me tomorrow to the forks of Jeffersons river\r\nwhere our baggage was by this time arrived with another Chief and a\r\nlarge party of whitemen who would wait my return at that place. that I\r\nwish them to take with them about 30 spare horses to transport our\r\nbaggage to this place where we would then remain sometime among them\r\nand trade with them for horses, and finally concert our future plans\r\nfor geting on to the ocean and of the traid which would be extended to\r\nthem after our return to our homes. he complyed with my request and\r\nmade a lengthey harrangue to his village. he returned in about an hour\r\nand a half and informed me that they would be ready to accompany me in\r\nthe morning. I promised to reward them for their trouble. Drewyer who\r\nhad had a good view of their horses estimated them at 400. most of them\r\nare fine horses. indeed many of them would make a figure on the South\r\nside of James River or the land of fine horses.--I saw several with\r\nSpanish brands on them, and some mules which they informed me that they\r\nhad also obtained from the Spaniards. I also saw a bridle bit of\r\nspanish manufactary, and sundry other articles which I have no doubt\r\nwere obtained from the same source. notwithstanding the extreem poverty\r\nof those poor people they are very merry they danced again this evening\r\nuntill midnight. each warrior keep one ore more horses tyed by a cord\r\nto a stake near his lodge both day and night and are always prepared\r\nfor action at a moments warning. they fight on horseback altogether.\r\nlobserve that the large flies are extreemly troublesome to the horses\r\nas well as ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe morning being cold and the men stif and soar from the exertions of\r\nyesterday Capt. Clark did not set out this morning untill 7 A.M. the\r\nriver was so crooked and rapid that they made but little way at one\r\nmile he passed a bold runing stream on Stard. which heads in a mountain\r\nto the North, on which there is snow. this we called track Creek. it is\r\n4 yard wide and 3 feet deep at 7 Ms. passed a stout stream which heads\r\nin some springs under the foot of the mountains on Lard. the river near\r\nthe mountain they found one continued rapid, with was extreemly\r\nlaborious and difficult to ascend. this evening Charbono struck his\r\nindian Woman for which Capt. C. gave him a severe repremand. Joseph and\r\nReubin Fields killed 4 deer and an Antelope, Capt. C. killed a buck.\r\nseveral of the men have lamed themselves by various accedents in\r\nworking the canoes through this difficult part of the river, and Capt.\r\nC. was obliged personally to assist them in this labour. they encamped\r\nthis evening on Lard. side near the rattlesnake clift\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 14, 1805]\r\nAugust 14th Wednesday 1805.\r\na Cold morning wind from the S.

I had eat\r\nnothing yesterday except one scant meal of the flour and berries except\r\nthe dryed cakes of berries which did not appear to satisfy my appetite\r\nas they appeared to do those of my Indian friends. I found on enquiry\r\nof McNeal that we had only about two pounds of flour remaining. this I\r\ndirected him to divide into two equal parts and to cook the one half\r\nthis morning in a kind of pudding with the hurries as he had done\r\nyesterday and reserve the ballance for the evening. on this new\r\nfashoned pudding four of us breakfasted, giving a pretty good allowance\r\nalso to the Chief who declared it the best thing he had taisted for a\r\nlong time. he took a little of the Hour in his hand, taisted and\r\nexamined very scrutinously and asked me if we made it of roots. I\r\nexplained to him the manner in which it grew. I hurried the departure\r\nof the Indians. the Chief addressed them several times before they\r\nwould move they seemed very reluctant to accompany me. I at length\r\nasked the reason and he told me that some foolish persons among them\r\nhad suggested the idea that we were in league with the Pahkees and had\r\ncome on in order to decoy them into an ambuscade where their enimies\r\nwere waiting to receive them. but that for his part he did not believe\r\nit. I readily perceived that our situation was not entirely free from\r\ndanger as the transision from suspicion to the confermation of the fact\r\nwould not be very difficult in the minds of these ignorant people who\r\nhave been accustomed from their infancy to view every stranger as an\r\nenimy. I told Cameahwait that I was sorry to find that they had put so\r\nlittle confidence in us, that I knew they were not acquainted with\r\nwhitemen and therefore could forgive them. that among whitemen it was\r\nconsidered disgracefull to lye or entrap an enimy by falsehood. I told\r\nhim if they continued to think thus meanly of us that they might rely\r\non it that no whitemen would ever come to trade with them or bring them\r\narms and amunition and that if the bulk of his nation still entertained\r\nthis opinion I still hoped that there were some among them that were\r\nnot affraid to die, that were men and would go with me and convince\r\nthemselves of the truth of what I had asscerted. that there was a party\r\nof whitemen waiting my return either at the forks of Jefferson's river\r\nor a little below coining on to that place in canoes loaded with\r\nprovisions and merchandize. he told me for his own part he was\r\ndetermined to go, that he was not affraid to die. I soon found that I\r\nhad touched him on the right string; to doubt the bravery of a savage\r\nis at once to put him on his metal. he now mounted his horse and\r\nharanged his village a third time; the perport of which as he\r\nafterwards told me was to inform them that he would go with us and\r\nconvince himself of the truth or falsity of what we had told him if he\r\nwas sertain he should be killed, that he hoped there were some of them\r\nwho heard him were not affraid to die with him and if there was to let\r\nhim see them mount their horses and prepare to set out. shortly after\r\nthis harange he was joined by six or eight only and with these I smoked\r\na pipe and directed the men to put on their packs being determined to\r\nset out with them while I had them in the humour at half after 12 we\r\nset out, several of the old women were crying and imploring the great\r\nsperit to protect their warriors as if they were going to inevitable\r\ndistruction. we had not proceeded far before our party was augmented by\r\nten or twelve more, and before we reached the Creek which we had passed\r\nin the morning of the 13th it appeared to me that we had all the men of\r\nthe village and a number of women with us. this may serve in some\r\nmeasure to ilustrate the capricious disposition of those people who\r\nnever act but from the impulse of the moment. they were now very\r\ncheerfull and gay, and two hours ago they looked as sirly as so many\r\nimps of satturn. when we arrived at the spring on the side of the\r\nmountain where we had encamped on the 12th the Chief insited on halting\r\nto let the horses graize with which I complyed and gave the Indians\r\nsmoke. they are excessively fond of the pipe; but have it not much in\r\ntheir power to indulge themselves with even their native tobacco as\r\nthey do not cultivate it themselves.--after remaining about an hour we\r\nagain set out, and by engaging to make compensation to four of them for\r\ntheir trouble obtained the previlege of riding with an indian myself\r\nand a similar situation for each of my party. I soon found it more\r\ntiresome riding without tirrups than walking and of course chose the\r\nlatter making the Indian carry my pack. about sunset we reached the\r\nupper part of the level valley of the Cove which now called Shoshone\r\nCove. the grass being birned on the North side of the river we passed\r\nover to the south and encamped near some willow brush about 4 miles\r\nabove the narrow pass between the hills noticed as I came up this cove\r\nthe river was here about six yards wide, and frequently darned up by\r\nthe beaver. I had sent Drewyer forward this evening before we halted to\r\nkill some meat but he was unsuccessfull and did not rejoin us untill\r\nafter dark I now cooked and among six of us eat the remaining pound of\r\nflour stired in a little boiling water.--Capt. Clark delayed again this\r\nmorning untill after breakfast, when he set out and passed between low\r\nand rugged mountains which had a few pine trees distributed over them\r\nthe clifts are formed of limestone and a hard black rock intermixed. no\r\ntrees on the river, the bottoms narrow river crooked shallow shoally\r\nand rapid. the water is as coald as that of the best springs in our\r\ncountry. the men as usual suffered excessively with fatiegue and the\r\ncoldness of the water to which they were exposed for hours together. at\r\nthe distance of 6 miles by water they passed the entrance of a bold\r\ncreek on Stard. side 10 yds. wide and 3 f. 3 i. deep which we called\r\nWillard's Creek after Alexander Willard one of our party. at 4 miles by\r\nwater from their encampment of las evening passed a bold branch which\r\ntumbled down a steep precipice of rocks from the mountains on the Lard.\r\nCapt Clark was very near being bitten twice today by rattlesnakes, the\r\nIndian woman also narrowly escaped. they caught a number of fine trout.\r\nCapt. Clark killed a buck which was the only game killed today. the\r\nvenison has an uncommon bitter taist which is unpleasent. I presume it\r\nproceeds from some article of their food, perhaps the willow on the\r\nleaves of which they feed very much. they encamped this evening on the\r\nLard. side near a few cottonwood trees about which there were the\r\nremains of several old Indian brush lodges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 15, 1805]\r\nAugust 15th Thursday 1805\r\na Cool windey morning wind from the S W we proceeded on thro a ruged\r\nlow mountain water rapid as usial passed a bold running Stream which\r\nfalls from the mountain on the Lard.

I\r\ninformed the Ceif of my view in this measure, and requested that he\r\nwould keep his young men with us lest by their hooping and noise they\r\nshould allarm the game and we should get nothing to eat, but so\r\nstrongly were there suspicions exited by this measure that two parties\r\nof discovery immediately set out one on ech side of the valley to watch\r\nthe hunters as I beleive to see whether they had not been sent to give\r\ninformation of their approach to an enemy that they still preswaided\r\nthemselves were lying in wait for them. I saw that any further effort\r\nto prevent their going would only add strength to their suspicions and\r\ntherefore said no more. after the hunters had been gone about an hour\r\nwe set out. we had just passed through the narrows when we saw one of\r\nthe spies comeing up the level plain under whip, the chief pawsed a\r\nlittle and seemed somewhat concerned. I felt a good deel so myself and\r\nbegan to suspect that by some unfortunate accedent that perhaps some of\r\nthere enimies had straggled hither at this unlucky moment; but we were\r\nall agreeably disappointed on the arrival of the young man to learn\r\nthat he had come to inform us that one of the whitemen had killed a\r\ndeer. in an instant they all gave their horses the whip and I was taken\r\nnearly a mile before I could learn what were the tidings; as I was\r\nwithout tirrups and an Indian behind me the jostling was disagreeable I\r\ntherefore reigned up my horse and forbid the indian to whip him who had\r\ngiven him the lash at every jum for a mile fearing he should loose a\r\npart of the feast. the fellow was so uneasy that he left me the horse\r\ndismounted and ran on foot at full speed, I am confident a mile. when\r\nthey arrived where the deer was which was in view of me they dismounted\r\nand ran in tumbling over each other like a parcel of famished dogs each\r\nseizing and tearing away a part of the intestens which had been\r\npreviously thrown out by Drewyer who killed it; the seen was such when\r\nI arrived that had I not have had a pretty keen appetite myself I am\r\nconfident I should not have taisted any part of the venison shortly.\r\neach one had a peice of some discription and all eating most\r\nravenously. some were eating the kidnies the melt and liver and the\r\nblood runing from the corners of their mouths, others were in a similar\r\nsituation with the paunch and guts but the exuding substance in this\r\ncase from their lips was of a different discription. one of the last\r\nwho attacted my attention particularly had been fortunate in his\r\nallotment or reather active in the division, he had provided himself\r\nwith about nine feet of the small guts one end of which he was chewing\r\non while with his hands he was squezzing the contents out at the other.\r\nI really did not untill now think that human nature ever presented\r\nitself in a shape so nearly allyed to the brute creation. I viewed\r\nthese poor starved divils with pity and compassion I directed McNeal to\r\nskin the deer and reserved a quarter, the ballance I gave the Chief to\r\nbe divided among his people; they devoured the whole of it nearly\r\nwithout cooking. I now boar obliquely to the left in order to\r\ninterscept the creek where there was some brush to make a fire, and\r\narrived at this stream where Drewyer had killed a second deer; here\r\nnearly the same seene was encored. a fire being kindled we cooked and\r\neat and gave the ballance of the two deer to the Indians who eat the\r\nwhole of them even to the soft parts of the hoofs. Drewyer joined us at\r\nbreakfast with a third deer. of this I reserved a quarter and gave the\r\nballance to the Indians. they all appeared now to have filled\r\nthemselves and were in a good humour. this morning early soon after the\r\nhunters set out a considerable part of our escort became allarmed and\r\nreturned 28 men and three women only continued with us. after eating\r\nand suffering the horses to graize about 2 hours we renued our march\r\nand towads evening arrived at the lower part of the cove Shields killed\r\nan Antelope on the way a part of which we took and gave the remainder\r\nto the Indians. being now informed of the place at which I expected to\r\nmeat Capt C. and the party they insisted on making a halt, which was\r\ncomplyed with. we now dismounted and the Chief with much cerimony put\r\ntippets about our necks such as they temselves woar I redily perceived\r\nthat this was to disguise us and owed it's origine to the same cause\r\nalready mentioned. to give them further confidence I put my cocked hat\r\nwith feather on the chief and my over shirt being of the Indian form my\r\nhair deshivled and skin well browned with the sun I wanted no further\r\naddition to make me a complete Indian in appearance the men followed my\r\nexample and we were son completely metamorphosed. I again repeated to\r\nthem the possibility of the party not having arrived at the place which\r\nI expected they were, but assured them they could not be far below,\r\nlest by not finding them at the forks their suspicions might arrise to\r\nsuch hight as to induce them to return precipitately. we now set out\r\nand rode briskly within sight of the forks making one of the Indians\r\ncarry the flag that our own party should know who we were. when we\r\narrived in sight at the distance of about 2 miles I discovered to my\r\nmortification that the party had not arrived, and the Indians slackened\r\ntheir pace. I now scarcely new what to do and feared every moment when\r\nthey would halt altogether, I now determined to restore their\r\nconfidence cost what it might and therefore gave the Chief my gun and\r\ntold him that if his enimies were in those bushes before him that he\r\ncould defend himself with that gun, that for my own part I was not\r\naffraid to die and if I deceived him he might make what uce of the gun\r\nhe thought proper or in other words that he might shoot me. the men\r\nalso gave their guns to other indians which seemed to inspire them with\r\nmore confidence; they sent their spies before them at some distance and\r\nwhen I drew near the place I thought of the notes which I had left and\r\ndirected Drewyer to go with an Indian man and bring them to me which he\r\ndid. the indian seeing him take the notes from the stake on which they\r\nhad been plased I now had recource to a stratagem in which I thought\r\nmyself justifyed by the occasion, but which I must confess set a little\r\nawkward. it had it's desired effect. after reading the notes which were\r\nthe same I had left I told the Chief that when I had left my brother\r\nChief with the party below where the river entered the mountain that we\r\nboth agreed not to bring the canoes higher up than the next forks of\r\nthe river above us wherever this might happen, that there he was to\r\nwait my return, should he arrive first, and that in the event of his\r\nnot being able to travel as fast as usual from the difficulty of the\r\nwater, that he was to send up to the first forks above him and leave a\r\nnote informing me where he was, that this note was left here today and\r\nthat he informed me that he was just below the mountains and was coming\r\non slowly up, and added that I should wait here for him, but if they\r\ndid not beleive me that I should send a man at any rate to the Chief\r\nand they might also send one of their young men with him, that myself\r\nand two others would remain with them at this place. this plan was\r\nreadily adopted and one of the young men offered his services; I\r\npromised him a knife and some beads as a reward for his confidence in\r\nus. most of them seemed satisfyed but there were several that\r\ncomplained of the Chief's exposing them to danger unnecessarily and\r\nsaid that we told different stories, in short a few were much\r\ndissatisfyed. I wrote a note to Capt. Clark by the light of some willow\r\nbrush and directed Drewyer to set out early being confident that there\r\nwas not a moment to spare. the chief and five or six others slept about\r\nmy fire and the others hid themselves in various parts of the willow\r\nbrush to avoid the enimy whom they were fearfull would attack them in\r\nthe course of the night. I now entertained various conjectures myself\r\nwith rispect to the cause of Capt. Clarks detention and was even fearful\r\nl that he had found the river so difficult that he had halted below the\r\nRattlesnake bluffs. I knew that if these people left me that they would\r\nimmediately disperse and secrete themselves in the mountains where it\r\nwould be impossible to find them or at least in vain to pursue them and\r\nthat they would spread the allarm to all other bands within our reach &\r\nof course we should be disappointed in obtaining horses, which would\r\nvastly retard and increase the labour of our voyage and I feared might\r\nso discourage the men as to defeat the expedition altogether. my mind\r\nwas in reallity quite as gloomy all this evening as the most affrighted\r\nindian but I affected cheerfullness to keep the Indians so who were\r\nabout me. we finally laid down and the Chief placed himself by the side\r\nof my musquetoe bier. I slept but little as might be well expected, my\r\nmind dwelling on the state of the expedition which I have ever held in\r\nequal estimation with my own existence, and the fait of which appeared\r\nat this moment to depend in a great measure upon the caprice of a few\r\nsavages who are ever as fickle as the wind. I had mentioned to the\r\nchief several times that we had with us a woman of his nation who had\r\nbeen taken prisoner by the Minnetares, and that by means of her I hoped\r\nto explain myself more fully than I could do by signs. some of the\r\nparty had also told the Indians that we had a man with us who was black\r\nand had short curling hair, this had excited their curiossity very\r\nmuch. and they seemed quite as anxious to see this monster as they wer\r\nthe merchandize which we had to barter for their horses.\r\n\r\nat 7 A M. Capt. C. set out after breakfast. he changed the hands in\r\nsome of the canoes; they proceeded with more ease than yesterday, yet\r\nthey found the river still rapid and shallow insomuch that they were\r\nobliged to drag the large canoes the greater part of the day. the water\r\nexcessively cold. in the evening they passed several bad rapids.\r\nconsiderable quantities of the buffaloe clover grows along the narrow\r\nbottoms through which they passed. there was no timber except a few\r\nscatiring small pine on the hills. willow service berry and currant\r\nbushes were the growth of the river bottoms. they geatherd considerable\r\nquantities of service berries, and caught some trout. one deer was\r\nkilled by the hunters who slept out last night. and did not join the\r\nparty untill 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nCapt. Clark sent the hunters this evening up to the forks of the river\r\nwhich he discovered from an eminence; they mus have left this place but\r\na little time before we arrived. this evening they encamped on the\r\nLard. side only a few miles below us. and were obliged like ourselves\r\nto make use of small willow brush for fuel. the men were much fatigued\r\nand exhausted this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 16, 1805]\r\nAugust 16th Friday 1805\r\nas this morning was cold and the men fatigued Stiff and Chilled\r\ndeturmined me to detain & take brackfast before I Set out.

I made McNeal cook the remainder\r\nof our meat which afforded a slight breakfast for ourselves and the\r\nCheif. Drewyer had been gone about 2 hours when an Indian who had\r\nstraggled some little distance down the river returned and reported\r\nthat the whitemen were coming, that he had seen them just below. they\r\nall appeared transported with joy, & the chef repeated his fraturnal\r\nhug. I felt quite as much gratifyed at this information as the Indians\r\nappeared to be. Shortly after Capt. Clark arrived with the Interpreter\r\nCharbono, and the Indian woman, who proved to be a sister of the Chif\r\nCameahwait. the meeting of those people was really affecting,\r\nparticularly between Sah cah-gar-we-ah and an Indian woman, who had\r\nbeen taken prisoner at the same time with her, and who had afterwards\r\nescaped from the Minnetares and rejoined her nation. At noon the Canoes\r\narrived, and we had the satisfaction once more to find ourselves all\r\ntogether, with a flattering prospect of being able to obtain as many\r\nhorses shortly as would enable us to prosicute our voyage by land\r\nshould that by water be deemed unadvisable.\r\n\r\nWe now formed our camp just below the junction of the forks on the\r\nLard. side in a level smooth bottom covered with a fine terf of\r\ngreenswoard. here we unloaded our canoes and arranged our baggage on\r\nshore; formed a canopy of one of our large sails and planted some\r\nwillow brush in the ground to form a shade for the Indians to set under\r\nwhile we spoke to them, which we thought it best to do this evening.\r\nacordingly about 4 P.M. we called them together and through the medium\r\nof Labuish, Charbono and Sah-cah-gar-weah, we communicated to them\r\nfully the objects which had brought us into this distant part of the\r\ncountry, in which we took care to make them a conspicuous object of our\r\nown good wishes and the care of our government. we made them sensible\r\nof their dependance on the will of our government for every species of\r\nmerchandize as well for their defence & comfort; and apprized them of\r\nthe strength of our government and it's friendly dispositions towards\r\nthem. we also gave them as a reason why we wished to petrate the\r\ncountry as far as the ocean to the west of them was to examine and find\r\nout a more direct way to bring merchandize to them. that as no trade\r\ncould be carryed on with them before our return to our homes that it\r\nwas mutually advantageous to them as well as to ourselves that they\r\nshould render us such aids as they had it in their power to furnish in\r\norder to haisten our voyage and of course our return home. that such\r\nwere their horses to transport our baggage without which we could not\r\nsubsist, and that a pilot to conduct us through the mountains was also\r\nnecessary if we could not decend the river by water. but that we did\r\nnot ask either their horses or their services without giving a\r\nsatisfactory compensation in return. that at present we wished them to\r\ncollect as many horses as were necessary to transport our baggage to\r\ntheir village on the Columbia where we would then trade with them at\r\nour leasure for such horses as they could spare us.--They appeared well\r\npleased with what had been said. the chief thanked us for friendship\r\ntowards himself and nation & declared his wish to serve us in every\r\nrispect; that he was sorry to find that it must yet be some time before\r\nthey could be furnished with firearms but said they could live as they\r\nhad done heretofore untill we brought them as we had promised. he said\r\nthey had not horses enough with them at present to remove our baggage\r\nto their village over the mountain, but that he would return tomorrow\r\nand encourage his people to come over with their horses and that he\r\nwould bring his own and assist us. this was complying with all we\r\nwished at present. we next enquired who were chiefs among them.\r\nCameahwait pointed out two others whom he said were Chiefs we gave him\r\na medal of the small size with the likeness of Mr. Jefferson the\r\nPresident of the U States in releif on one side and clasp hands with a\r\npipe and tomahawk on the other, to the other Chiefs we gave each a\r\nsmall medal which were struck in the Presidency of George Washing Esqr.\r\nwe also gave small medals of the last discription to two young men whom\r\nthe 1st Chief informed us wer good young men and much rispected among\r\nthem. we gave the 1st Chief an uniform coat shirt a pair of scarlet\r\nlegings a carrot of tobacco and some small articles to each of the\r\nothers we gave a shirt leging handkerchief a knife some tobacco and a\r\nfew small articles we also distributed a good quantity paint mockerson\r\nawls knives beads lookingglasses &c among the other Indians and gave\r\nthem a plentifull meal of lyed corn which was the first they had ever\r\neaten in their lives. they were much pleased with it. every article\r\nabout us appeared to excite astonishment in ther minds; the appearance\r\nof the men, their arms, the canoes, our manner of working them, the\r\nback man york and the segacity of my dog were equally objects of\r\nadmiration. I also shot my air-gun which was so perfectly\r\nincomprehensible that they immediately denominated it the great\r\nmedicine. the idea which the indians mean to convey by this appellation\r\nis something that eminates from or acts immediately by the influence or\r\npower of the great sperit; or that in which the power of god is\r\nmanifest by it's incomprehensible power of action. our hunters killed 4\r\ndeer and an Antelope this evening of which we also gave the Indians a\r\ngood proportion. the cerimony of our council and smoking the pipe was\r\nin conformity of the custom of this nation perfomed bearfoot. on those\r\noccasions points of etiquet are quite as much attended to by the\r\nIndians as among scivilized nations. To keep indians in a good humour\r\nyou must not fatiegue them with too much business at one time.\r\ntherefore after the council we gave them to eat and amused them a while\r\nby shewing them such articles as we thought would be entertaining to\r\nthem, and then renewed our enquiries with rispect to the country. the\r\ninformation we derived was only a repetition of that they had given me\r\nbefore and in which they appeared to be so candid that I could not\r\navoid yealing confidence to what they had said. Capt. Clark and myself\r\nnow concerted measures for our future operations, and it was mutually\r\nagreed that he should set out tomorrow morning with eleven men\r\nfurnished with axes and other necessary tools for making canoes, their\r\narms accoutrements and as much of their baggage as they could carry.\r\nalso to take the indians Carbono and the indian woman with him; that on\r\nhis arrival at the Shoshone camp he was to leave Charbono and the\r\nIndian woman to haisten the return of the Indians with their horses to\r\nthis place, and to proceede himself with the eleven men down the\r\nColumbia in order to examine the river and if he found it navigable and\r\ncould obtain timber to set about making canoes immediately. In the mean\r\ntime I was to bring on the party and baggage to the Shoshone Camp,\r\ncalculating that by the time I should reach that place that he would\r\nhave sufficiently informed himself with rispect to the state of the\r\nriver &c. as to determine us whether to prosicute our journey from\r\nthence by land or water. in the former case we should want all the\r\nhorses which we could perchase, the latter only to hire the Indians to\r\ntransport our baggage to the place at which we made the canoes. in\r\norder to inform me as early as possible of the state of the river he\r\nwas to send back one of the men with the necessary information as soon\r\nas he should satisfy himself on this subject. this plan being settled\r\nwe gave orders accordingly and the men prepared for an early march. the\r\nnights are very cold and the sun excessively hot in the day. we have no\r\nfuel here but a few dry willow brush. and from the appearance of\r\ncountry I am confident we shall not find game here to subsist us many\r\ndays. these are additional reasons why I conceive it necessary to get\r\nunder way as soon as possible.--this morning Capt. Clark had delayed\r\nuntill 7 A.M. before he set out just about which time Drewyer arrived\r\nwith the Indian; he left the canoes to come on after him, and\r\nimmediately set out and joined me as has been before mentioned.The\r\nsperits of the men were now much elated at the prospect of geting\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 17, 1805]\r\nAugust 17th Satturday 1805\r\na fair Cold morning wind S.

Lewis met\r\nme with great cordialliaty embraced and took a Seat on a white robe,\r\nthe Main Chief imedeately tied to my hair Six Small pieces of Shells\r\nresembling perl which is highly Valued by those people and is prcured\r\nfrom the nations resideing near the Sea Coast. we then Smoked in their\r\nfassion without Shoes and without much cerimoney and form.\r\n\r\nCapt Lewis informed me he found those people on the Columbia River\r\nabout 40 miles from the forks at that place there was a large camp of\r\nthem, he had purswaded those with him to Come and See that what he said\r\nwas the truth, they had been under great apprehension all the way, for\r\nfear of their being deceived. The Great Chief of this nation proved to\r\nbe the brother of the Woman with us and is a man of Influence Sence &\r\neasey & reserved manners, appears to possess a great deel of Cincerity.\r\nThe Canoes arrived & unloaded--every thing appeared to asstonish those\r\npeople. the appearance of the men, their arms, the Canoes, the Clothing\r\nmy black Servent. & the Segassity of Capt Lewis's Dog. we Spoke a fiew\r\nwords to them in the evening respecting our rout intentions our want of\r\nhorses &c. & gave them a fiew presents & medals--we made a number of\r\ninquires of those people about the Columbia River the Countrey game &c.\r\nThe account they gave us was verry unfavourable, that the River\r\nabounded in emence falls, one perticularly much higher than the falls\r\nof the Missouri & at the place the mountains Closed So Close that it\r\nwas impracticable to pass, & that the ridge Continued on each Side of\r\nperpendicular Clifts inpenetratable, and that no Deer Elk or any game\r\nwas to be found in that Countrey, aded to that they informed us that\r\nthere was no timber on the river Sufficiently large to make Small\r\nCanoes, This information (if true is alarming) I deturmined to go in\r\nadvance and examine the Countrey, See if those dificueltes presented\r\nthemselves in the gloomey picture in which they painted them, and if\r\nthe river was practiable and I could find timber to build Canoes, those\r\nIdeas & plan appeard to be agreeable to Capt Lewis's Ideas on this\r\npoint, and I selected 11 men, directed them to pack up their baggage\r\nComplete themselves with amunition, take each an ax and Such tools as\r\nwill be Soutable to build Canoes, and be ready to Set out at 10 oClock\r\ntomorrow morning. Those people greatly pleased our hunters killed three\r\nDeer & an antilope which was eaten in a Short time the Indians being so\r\nharrassed & compelled to move about in those rugid mountains that they\r\nare half Starved liveing at this time on berries & roots which they\r\ngeather in the plains. Those people are not begerley but generous, only\r\none has asked me for anything and he for powder.\r\n\r\nThis nation Call themselves Cho-shop-ne the Chief is name\r\nToo-et-te-con'l Black Gun is his war name Ka-me-ah-wah--or Come &\r\nSmoke. this Chief gave me the following name and pipe Ka-me-ah-wah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 18, 1805]\r\nSunday August 18th 1805.\r\nThis morning while Capt Clark was busily engaged in preparing for his\r\nrout, I exposed some articles to barter with the Indians for horses as\r\nI wished a few at this moment to releive the men who were going with\r\nCapt Clark from the labour of carrying their baggage and also one to\r\nkeep here in order to pack the meat to camp which the hunters might\r\nkill. I soon obtained three very good horses for which I gave an\r\nuniform coat, a pair of legings, a few handkerchiefs, three knives and\r\nsome other small articles the whole of which did not cost more than\r\nabout 20$ in the U States. the Indians seemed quite as well pleased\r\nwith their bargin as I was. the men also purchased one for an old\r\nchecked shirt a pair of old legings and a knife. two of those I\r\npurchased Capt. C. took on with him. at 10 A.M. Capt. Clark departed\r\nwith his detatchment and all the Indians except 2 men and 2 women who\r\nremained with us. Two of the inferior chiefs were a little displeased\r\nat not having received a present equivolent to that given the first\r\nChief. to releive this difficulty Capt. Clark bestoed a couple of his\r\nold coats on them and I promised that if they wer active in assisting\r\nme over the mountains with horses that I would give them an additional\r\npresent; this seemed perfectly to satisfy them and they all set out in\r\na good humour. Capt. Clark encamped this evening near the narrow pass\r\nbetween the hills on Jefferson's river in the Shoshone Cove. his\r\nhunters killed one deer which the party with the aid of the Indians\r\nreadily consumed in the course of the evening.--after there departure\r\nthis morning I had all the stores and baggage of every discription\r\nopened and aired. and began the operation of forming the packages in\r\nproper parsels for the purpose of transporting them on horseback. the\r\nrain in the evening compelled me to desist from my operations. I had\r\nthe raw hides put in the water in order to cut them in throngs proper\r\nfor lashing the packages and forming the necessary geer for pack\r\nhorses, a business which I fortunately had not to learn on this\r\noccasion. Drewyer Killed one deer this evening. a beaver was also\r\ncaught by one of the party. I had the net arranged and set this evening\r\nto catch some trout which we could see in great abundance at the bottom\r\nof the river. This day I completed my thirty first year, and conceived\r\nthat I had in all human probability now existed about half the period\r\nwhich I am to remain in this Sublunary world. I reflected that I had as\r\nyet done but little, very little indeed, to further the hapiness of the\r\nhuman race, or to advance the information of the succeeding generation.\r\nI viewed with regret the many hours I have spent in indolence, and now\r\nsoarly feel the want of that information which those hours would have\r\ngiven me had they been judiciously expended. but since they are past\r\nand cannot be recalled, I dash from me the gloomy thought and resolved\r\nin future, to redouble my exertions and at least indeavour to promote\r\nthose two primary objects of human existence, by giving them the aid of\r\nthat portion of talents which nature and fortune have bestoed on me; or\r\nin future, to live for mankind, as I have heretofore lived for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 18, 1805]\r\nAugust 18th Sunday 1805\r\nPurchased of the Indians three horses for which we gave a Chiefs Coat\r\nSome Handkerchiefs a Shirt Legins & a fiew arrow points &c. I gave two\r\nof my coats to two of the under Chiefs who appeared not well Satisfied\r\nthat the first Chief was dressed so much finer than themselves. at 10\r\noClock I Set out accompanied by the Indians except 3 the interpreter\r\nand wife, the fore part of the day worm, at 12 oClock it became hasey\r\nwith a mist of rain wind hard from the S. W. and Cold which increased\r\nuntill night the rain Seased in about two hours. We proceeded on thro a\r\nwide leavel vallie without wood except willows & Srubs for 15 miles and\r\nEncamped at a place the high lands approach within 200 yards in 2\r\npoints the River here only 10 yards wide Several Small Streams\r\nbranching out on each Side below. all the Indians proceeded on except\r\nthe 3 Chiefs & two young men. my hunters killed two Deer which we eate.\r\nThe Course from the forks is West 9 miles N. 60° W. 6 miles. The Laid. of\r\nthe forks agreeable to observations is 43° 30' 43\" North-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 19, 1805]\r\nMonday August 19th 1805.\r\nThis morning I arrose at dylight. and sent out three hunters. some of\r\nthe men who were much in want of legings and mockersons I suffered to\r\ndress some skins. the others I employed in repacking the baggage,\r\nmaking pack saddles &c. we took up the net this morning but caugt no\r\nfish. one beaver was caught in a trap. the frost which perfectly\r\nwhitened the grass this morning had a singular appearance to me at this\r\nseason. this evening I made a few of the men construct a sein of willow\r\nbrush which we hawled and caught a large number of fine trout and a\r\nkind of mullet about 16 Inhes long which I had not seen before. the\r\nscales are small, the nose is long and obtusely pointed and exceedes\r\nthe under jaw. the mouth is not large but opens with foalds at the\r\nsides, the colour of it's back and sides is of a bluish brown and\r\nbelley white; it has the faggot bones, from which I have supposed it to\r\nbe of the mullet kind. the tongue and pallate are smooth and it has no\r\nteeth. it is by no means as good as the trout. the trout are the same\r\nwhich I first met with at the falls of the Missouri, they are larger\r\nthan the speckled trout of our mountains and equally as well flavored.-\r\nThe hunters returned this evening with two deer. from what has been\r\nsaid of the Shoshones it will be readily perceived that they live in a\r\nwretched stait of poverty. yet notwithstanding their extreem poverty\r\nthey are not only cheerfull but even gay, fond of gaudy dress and\r\namusements; like most other Indians they are great egotists and\r\nfrequently boast of heroic acts which they never performed. they are\r\nalso fond of games of wrisk. they are frank, communicative, fair in\r\ndealing, generous with the little they possess, extreemly honest, and\r\nby no means beggarly. each individual is his own sovereign master, and\r\nacts from the dictates of his own mind; the authority of the Cheif\r\nbeing nothing more than mere admonition supported by the influence\r\nwhich the propiety of his own examplery conduct may have acquired him\r\nin the minds of the individuals who compose the band. the title of\r\ncheif is not hereditary, nor can I learn that there is any cerimony of\r\ninstalment, or other epoh in the life of a Cheif from which his title\r\nas such can be dated. in fact every man is a chief, but all have not an\r\nequal influence on the minds of the other members of the community, and\r\nhe who happens to enjoy the greatest share of confidence is the\r\nprincipal Chief. The Shoshonees may be estimated at about 100 warriors,\r\nand about three times that number of woomen and children. they have\r\nmore children among them than I expected to have seen among a people\r\nwho procure subsistence with such difficulty. there are but few very\r\nold persons, nor did they appear to treat those with much tenderness or\r\nrispect. The man is the sole propryetor of his wives and daughters, and\r\ncan barter or dispose of either as he thinks proper. a plurality of\r\nwives is common among them, but these are not generally sisters as with\r\nthe Minnetares & Mandans but are purchased of different fathers. The\r\nfather frequently disposes of his infant daughters in marriage to men\r\nwho are grown or to men who have sons for whom they think proper to\r\nprovide wives. the compensation given in such cases usually consists of\r\nhorses or mules which the father receives at the time of contract and\r\nconverts to his own uce. the girl remains with her parents untill she\r\nis conceived to have obtained the age of puberty which with them is\r\nconsidered to be about the age of 13 or 14 years. the female at this\r\nage is surrendered to her sovereign lord and husband agreeably to\r\ncontract, and with her is frequently restored by the father quite as\r\nmuch as he received in the first instance in payment for his daughter;\r\nbut this is discretionary with the father. Sah-car-gar-we-ah had been\r\nthus disposed of before she was taken by the Minnetares, or had arrived\r\nto the years of puberty. the husband was yet living and with this band.\r\nhe was more than double her age and had two other wives. he claimed her\r\nas his wife but said that as she had had a child by another man, who\r\nwas Charbono, that he did not want her. They seldom correct their\r\nchildren particularly the boys who soon become masters of their own\r\nacts. they give as a reason that it cows and breaks the Sperit of the\r\nboy to whip him, and that he never recovers his independence of mind\r\nafter he is grown. They treat their women but with little rispect, and\r\ncompel them to perform every species of drudgery. they collect the wild\r\nfruits and roots, attend to the horses or assist in that duty cook\r\ndreess the skins and make all their apparal, collect wood and make\r\ntheir fires, arrange and form their lodges, and when they travel pack\r\nthe horses and take charge of all the baggage; in short the man dose\r\nlittle else except attend his horses hunt and fish. the man considers\r\nhimself degraded if he is compelled to walk any distance, and if he is\r\nso unfortunately poor as only to possess two horses he rides the best\r\nhimself and leavs the woman or women if he has more than one, to\r\ntransport their baggage and children on the other, and to walk if the\r\nhorse is unable to carry the additional weight of their persons--the\r\nchastity of their women is not held in high estimation, and the husband\r\nwill for a trifle barter the companion of his bead for a night or\r\nlonger if he conceives the reward adiquate; tho they are not so\r\nimportunate that we should caress their women as the siouxs were and\r\nsome of their women appear to be held more sacred than in any nation we\r\nhave seen I have requested the men to give them no cause of jealousy by\r\nhaving connection with their women without their knowledge, which with\r\nthem strange as it may seem is considered as disgracefull to the\r\nhusband as clandestine connections of a similar kind are among\r\ncivilized nations. to prevent this mutual exchange of good officies\r\naltogether I know it impossible to effect, particularly on the part of\r\nour young men whom some months abstinence have made very polite to\r\nthose tawney damsels. no evil has yet resulted and I hope will not from\r\nthese connections.--notwithstanding the late loss of horses which this\r\npeople sustained by the Minnetares the stock of the band may be very\r\nsafely estimated at seven hundred of which they are perhaps about 40\r\ncoalts and half that number of mules.these people are deminutive in\r\nstature, thick ankles, crooked legs, thick flat feet and in short but\r\nilly formed, at least much more so in general than any nation of\r\nIndians I ever saw. their complexion is much that of the Siouxs or\r\ndarker than the Minnetares mandands or Shawnees. generally both men and\r\nwomen wear their hair in a loos lank flow over the sholders and face;\r\ntho I observed some few men who confined their hair in two equal cues\r\nhanging over each ear and drawnn in front of the body. the cue is\r\nformed with throngs of dressed lather or Otterskin aternately crossing\r\neach other. at present most of them have cut short in the neck in\r\nconsequence of the loss of their relations by the Minnetares.\r\nCameahwait has his cut close all over his head. this constitutes their\r\ncerimony of morning for their deceased relations. the dress of the men\r\nconsists of a robe long legings, shirt, tippet and Mockersons, that of\r\nthe women is also a robe, chemise, and Mockersons; sometimes they make\r\nuse of short legings. the ornements of both men and women are very\r\nsimilar, and consist of several species of sea shells, blue and white\r\nbeads, bras and Iron arm bands, plaited cords of the sweet grass, and\r\ncollars of leather ornamented with the quills of the porcupine dyed of\r\nvarious colours among which I observed the red, yellow, blue, and\r\nblack. the ear is purforated in the lower part to receive various\r\nornaments but the nose is not, nor is the ear lasserated or disvigored\r\nfor this purpose as among many nations. the men never mark their skins\r\nby birning, cuting, nor puncturing and introducing a colouring matter\r\nas many nations do. there women sometimes puncture a small circle on\r\ntheir forehead nose or cheeks and thus introduce a black matter usually\r\nsoot and grease which leaves an indelible stane. tho this even is by no\r\nmeans common. their arms offensive and defensive consist in the bow and\r\narrows sheild, some lances, and a weapon called by the Cippeways who\r\nformerly used it, the pog-gal'-mag-gon'. in fishing they employ wairs,\r\ngigs, and fishing hooks. the salmon is the principal object of their\r\npursuit. they snair wolves and foxes. I was anxious to learn whether\r\nthese people had the venerial, and made the enquiry through the\r\nintrepreter and his wife; the information was that they sometimes had\r\nit but I could not learn their remedy; they most usually die with it's\r\neffects. this seems a strong proof that these disorders bothe\r\ngonaroehah and Louis venerae are native disorders of America. tho these\r\npeople have suffered much by the small pox which is known to be\r\nimported and perhaps those other disorders might have been contracted\r\nfrom other indian tribes who by a round of communication might have\r\nobtained from the Europeans since it was introduced into that quarter\r\nof the globe. but so much detatched on the other had from all\r\ncommunication with the whites that I think it most probable that those\r\ndisorders are original with them. from the middle of May to the firt of\r\nSeptember these people reside on the waters of the Columbia where they\r\nconsider themselves in perfect security from their enimies as they have\r\nnot as yet ever found their way to this retreat; during this season the\r\nsalmon furnish the principal part of their subsistence and as this\r\nfirsh either perishes or returns about the 1st of September they are\r\ncompelled at this season in surch of subsistence to resort to the\r\nMissouri, in the vallies of which, there is more game even within the\r\nmountains. here they move slowly down the river in order to collect and\r\njoin other bands either of their own nation or the Flatheads, and\r\nhaving become sufficiently strong as they conceive venture on the\r\nEastern side of the Rockey mountains into the plains, where the\r\nbuffaloe abound. but they never leave the interior of the mountains\r\nwhile they can obtain a scanty subsistence, and always return as soon\r\nas they have acquired a good stock of dryed meat in the plains; when\r\nthis stock is consumed they venture again into the plains; thus\r\nalternately obtaining their food at the risk of their lives and\r\nretiring to the mountains, while they consume it.--These people are now\r\non the eve of their departure for the Missouri, and inform us that they\r\nexpect to be joined at or about the three forks by several bands of\r\ntheir own nation, and a band of the Flatheads. as I am now two busily\r\nengaged to enter at once into a minute discription of the several\r\narticles which compose their dress, impliments of war hunting fishing\r\n&c I shall pursue them at my leasure in the order they have here\r\noccurred to my mind, and have been mentioned. This morning capt. Clark\r\ncontinued his rout with his party, the Indians accompanying him as\r\nyesterday; he was obliged to feed them. nothing remarkable happened\r\nduring the day. he was met by an Indian with two mules on this side of\r\nthe dividing ridge at the foot of the mountain, the Indian had the\r\npoliteness to offer Capt. C. one of his mules to ride as he was on\r\nfoot, which he accepted and gave the fellow a waistcoat as a reward for\r\nhis politeness. in the evening he reached the creek on this side of the\r\nIndian camp and halted for the night. his hunters killed nothing today.\r\nThe Indians value their mules very highly. a good mule can not be\r\nobtained for less than three and sometimes four horses, and the most\r\nindifferent are rated at two horses. their mules generally are the\r\nfinest I ever saw without any comparison.--today I observed time and\r\ndistance of sun's and moon's nearest limbs with sextant sun East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 19, 1805]\r\nAugust 19th Monday 1805\r\nA verry Cold morning Frost to be Seen we Set out at 7 oClock and\r\nproceeded on thro a wide leavel Vallie the Chief Shew me the place that\r\na number of his nation was killed about 1 years past this Vallie\r\nContinues 5 miles & then becoms narrow, the beaver has Darned up the\r\nRiver in maney places we proceeded on up the main branch with a gradial\r\nassent to the head and passed over a low mountain and Decended a Steep\r\nDecent to a butifull Stream, passed over a Second hill of a verry Steep\r\nassent & thro a hilley Countrey for 8 miles an Encamped on a Small\r\nStream the Indians with us we wer oblige to feed--one man met one with\r\na mule & Spanish Saddle to ride, I gave him a wistoat a mule is\r\nconsidered a of great value among those people we proceeded on over a\r\nverry mountanious Countrey across the head of hollows & Springs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 20, 1805]\r\nTuesday August 20th 1805.\r\nThis morning I sent out the two hunters and employed the ballance of\r\nthe party pretty much as yesterday. I walked down the river about--3/4\r\nof a mile and scelected a place near the river bank unperceived by the\r\nIndians for a cash, which I set three men to make, and directed the\r\ncentinel to discharge his gun if he pereceived any of the Indians going\r\ndown in that direction which was to be the signal for the men at work\r\non the cash to desist and seperate, least these people should discover\r\nour deposit and rob us of the baggage we intend leaving here. by\r\nevening the cash was completed unperceived by the Indians, and all our\r\npackages made up. the Pack-saddles and harries is not yet complete. in\r\nthis operation we find ourselves at a loss for nails and boards; for\r\nthe first we substitute throngs of raw hide which answer verry well,\r\nand for the last to cut off the blades of our oars and use the plank of\r\nsome boxes which have heretofore held other articles and put those\r\narticles into sacks of raw hide which I have had made for the purpose.\r\nby this means I have obtained as many boards as will make 20 saddles\r\nwhich I suppose will be sufficient for our present exegencies. The\r\nIndians with us behave themselves extreemly well; the women have been\r\nbusily engaged all day making and mending the mockersons of our party.\r\nIn the evening the hunters returned unsuccessfull. Drewyer went in\r\nsearch of his trap which a beaver had taken off last night; he found\r\nthe beaver dead with the trap to his foot about 2 miles below the place\r\nhe had set it. this beaver constituted the whole of the game taken\r\ntoday. the fur of this animal is as good as I ever saw any, and beleive\r\nthat they are never out of season on the upper part of the Missouri and\r\nit's branches within the Mountains. Goodrich caught several douzen fine\r\ntrout. today. I made up a small assortment of medicines, together with\r\nthe specemines of plants, minerals, seeds &c. which, I have collected\r\nbetwen this place and the falls of the Missouri which I shall deposit\r\nhere. the robe woarn by the Shoshonees is the same in both sexes and is\r\nloosly thrown about their sholders, and the sides at pleasure either\r\nhanging loose or drawn together with the hands, sometimes if the\r\nweather is cold they confine it with a girdel arround the waist; they\r\nare generally about the size of a 21/2 point blanket for grown persons\r\nand reach as low as the middle of the leg. this robe forms a garment in\r\nthe day and constitutes their only covering at night. with these people\r\nthe robe is formed most commonly of the skins of Antelope, Bighorn, or\r\ndeer, dressed with the hair on, tho they prefer the buffaloe when they\r\ncan procure them. I have also observed some robes among them of beaver,\r\nmoonax, and small wolves. the summer robes of both sexes are also\r\nfrequently made of the Elk's skin dressed without the hair. The shirt\r\nof the men is really a commodious and decent garment. it roomy and\r\nreaches nearly half way the thye, there is no collar, the apperture\r\nbeing sufficiently large to admit the head and is left square at top,\r\nor most frequently, both before and behind terminate in the tails of\r\nthe animals of which they are made and which foald outwards being\r\nfrequently left entire or somtimes cut into a fring on the edges and\r\nornimented with the quills of the Porcupine. the sides of the shirt are\r\nsewed deeply fringed, and ornamented in a similar manner from the\r\nbottom upwards, within six or eight inches of the sieve from whence it\r\nis left open as well as the sieve on it's under side to the elbow\r\nnearly. from the elbow the sieve fits the arm tight as low as the wrist\r\nand is not ornimented with a fringe as the sides and under parts of the\r\nsieve are above the elbow. the sholder straps are wide and on them is\r\ngenerally displayed the taste of the manufacterer in a variety of\r\nfigures wrought with the quills of the porcupine of several colours;\r\nbeads when they have them are also displayed on this part. the tail of\r\nthe shirt is left in the form which the fore legs and neck give it with\r\nthe addition of a slight fringe. the hair is usually left on the tail,\r\n& near the hoofs of the animal; part of the hoof is also retained to\r\nthe skin and is split into a fring by way of orniment. these shirts are\r\ngenerally made of deer's Antelope's, Bighorn's, or Elk's skins dressed\r\nwithout the hair. the Elk skin is less used for this purpose than\r\neither of the others. their only thread used on this or any other\r\noccasion is the sinews taken from the back and loins of the deer Elk\r\nbuffaloe &c. Their legings are most usually formed of the skins of the\r\nAntelope dressed without the hair. in the men they are very long and\r\nfull each leging being formed of a skin nearly entire. the legs, tail\r\nand neck are also left on these, and the tail woarn upwards; and the\r\nneck deeply fringed and ornimented with porcupine qulls drags or trails\r\non the ground behind the heel. the skin is sewn in such manner as to\r\nfit the leg and thye closely; the upper part being left open a\r\nsufficient distance to permit the legs of the skin to be dran\r\nunderneath a girdle both before and behind, and the wide part of the\r\nskin to cover the buttock and lap before in such manner that the\r\nbreechcloth is unnecessary. they are much more decent in concealing\r\nthose parts than any nation on the Missouri the sides of the legings\r\nare also deeply fringed and ornimented. sometimes this part is\r\nornimented with little fassicles of the hair of an enimy whom they have\r\nslain in battle. The tippet of the Snake Indians is the most eligant\r\npeice of Indian dress I ever saw, the neck or collar of this is formed\r\nof a strip of dressed Otter skin with the fur. it is about four or five\r\ninches wide and is cut out of the back of the skin the nose and eyes\r\nforming one extremity and the tail the other. begining a little behind\r\nthe ear of the animal at one edge of this collar and proceeding towards\r\nthe tail, they attatch from one to two hundred and fifty little roles\r\nof Ermin skin formed in the following manner. the skin is first dressed\r\nwith the fur on it and a narrow strip is cut out of the back of the\r\nskin reaching from the nose and imbracing the tail. this is sewed\r\narround a small cord of the silk-grass twisted for the purpose and\r\nregularly tapering in such manner as to give it ajust proportion to the\r\ntail which is to form the lower extremity of the stran. thus arranged\r\nthey are confined at the upper point in little bundles of two-three, or\r\nmore as the disign may be to make them more full; these are then\r\nattatched to the collars as before mentioned, and to conceal the\r\nconnection of this part which would otherwise have a course appearance\r\nthey attatch a broad fringe of the Ermin skin to the collar overlaying\r\nthat part. little bundles of fine fringe of the same materials is\r\nfastened to the extremity of the tails in order to shew their black\r\nextremities to greater advantage. the center of the otterskin collar is\r\nalso ornamented with the shells of the perl oister. the collar is\r\nconfined arond the neck and the little roles of Ermin skin about the\r\nsize of a large quill covers the solders and body nearly to the waist\r\nand has the appearance of a short cloak and is really handsome. these\r\nthey esteem very highly, and give or dispose of only on important\r\noccasions. the ermin whic is known to the traiders of the N. W. by the\r\nname of the white weasel is the genuine ermine, and might no doubt be\r\nturned to great advantage by those people if they would encourage the\r\nIndians to take them. they are no doubt extreemly plenty and readily\r\ntaken, from the number of these tippets which I have seen among these\r\npeople and the great number of skins employed in the construction of\r\neach timppet. scarcely any of them have employed less than one hundred\r\nof these skins in their formation.--This morning Capt. Clark set out at\r\n6 in the morning and soon after arrived near their camp they having\r\nremoved about 2 miles higher up the river than the camp at which they\r\nwere when I first visited them. the chief requested a halt, which was\r\ncomplyed with, and a number of the indians came out from the village\r\nand joined them after smoking a few pipes with them they all proceeded\r\nto the village where Capt C. was conducted to a large lodge prepared in\r\nthe center of the encampment for himself and party. here they gave him\r\none salmon and some cakes of dryed berries. he now repeated to them\r\nwhat had been said to them in council at this place which was repeated\r\nto the village by the Cheif. when he had concluded this address he\r\nrequested a guide to accompany him down the river and an elderly man\r\nwas pointed out by the Cheif who consented to undertake this task. this\r\nwas the old man of whom Cameahwait had spoken as a person well\r\nacquainted with the country to the North of this river. Capt. C.\r\nencouraged the Indians to come over with their horses and assist me\r\nover with the baggage. he distrubuted some presents among the Indians.\r\nabout half the men of the village turned out to hunt the antelope but\r\nwere unsuccessfull. at 3 P.M. Capt. Clark departed, accompanyed by his\r\nguide and party except one man whom he left with orders to purchase a\r\nhorse if possible and overtake him as soon as he could. he left\r\nCharbono and the indian woman to return to my camp with the Indians. he\r\npassed the river about four miles below the Indians, and encamped on a\r\nsmall branch, eight miles distant. on his way he met a rispectable\r\nlooking indian who returned and continued with him all night; this\r\nindian gave them three salmon. Capt. C. killed a cock of the plains or\r\nmountain cock. it was of a dark brown colour with a long and pointed\r\ntail larger than the dunghill fowl and had a fleshey protuberant\r\nsubstance about the base of the upper chap, something like that of the\r\nturkey tho without the snout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 20, 1805]\r\nAugust 20th Tuesday 1805\r\nSet out at half past 6 oClock and proceeded on (met maney parties of\r\nIndians) thro a hilley Countrey to the Camp of the Indians on a branch\r\nof the Columbia River, before we entered this Camp a Serimonious hault\r\nwas requested by the Chief and I Smoked with all that Came around for\r\nSeveral pipes, we then proceeded on to the Camp & I was introduced into\r\nthe only Lodge they had which was pitched in the Center for my party\r\nall the other Lodges made of bushes, after a fiew Indian Seremonies I\r\ninformed the Indians the object of our journey our good intentions\r\ntowards them my consern for their distressed Situation, what we had\r\ndone for them in makeing a piece with the Minitarras Mandans Rickara\r\n&c. for them-. and requested them all to take over their horses &\r\nassist Capt Leiwis across &c. also informing them the oject of my\r\njourney down the river and requested a guide to accompany me, all of\r\nwhich was repeited by the Chief to the whole village.\r\n\r\nThose pore people Could only raise a Sammon & a little dried Choke\r\nCherris for us half the men of the tribe with the Chief turned out to\r\nhunt the antilopes, at 3 oClock after giveing a fiew Small articles as\r\npresents I set out accompanied by an old man as a Guide (I endevered to\r\nprocure as much information from thos people as possible without much\r\nSuckcess they being but little acquainted or effecting to be So-) I lef\r\none man to purchase a horse and overtake me and proceeded on thro a\r\nwide rich bottom on a beaten Roade 8 miles Crossed the river and\r\nencamped on a Small run, this evening passed a number of old lodges,\r\nand met a number of men women children & horses, met a man who appeared\r\nof Some Consideration who turned back with us, he halted a woman & gave\r\nus 3 Small Sammon, this man continued with me all night and partook of\r\nwhat I had which was a little Pork verry Salt. Those Indians are verry\r\nattentive to Strangers &c. I left our interpreter & his woman to\r\naccompany the Indians to Capt Lewis tomorrow the Day they informed me\r\nthey would Set out I killed a Pheasent at the Indian Camp larger than a\r\ndungal fowl with feshey protuberances about the head like a turkey.\r\nFrost last night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 21, 1805]\r\nWednesday August 21st 1805.\r\nThis morning was very cold. the ice 1/4 of an inch thick on the water\r\nwhich stood in the vessels exposed to the air. some wet deerskins that\r\nhad been spread the grass last evening are stiffly frozen. the ink\r\nfeizes in my pen. the bottoms are perfectly covered with frost insomuch\r\nthat they appear to be covered with snow. This morning early I\r\ndispatched two hunters to kill some meat if possible before the Indians\r\narrive; Drewyer I sent with the horse into the cove for that purpose.\r\nThe party pursued their several occupations as yesterday. by evening I\r\nhad all the baggage, saddles, and harness completely ready for a march.\r\nafter dark, I made the men take the baggage to the cash and deposit it.\r\nI beleve we have been unperceived by the Indians in this movement.\r\nnotwithstanding the coldness of the last night the day has proved\r\nexcessively warm. neither of the hunters returned this evening and I\r\nwas obliged to issue pork and corn. The mockersons of both sexes are\r\nusually the same and are made of deer Elk or buffaloe skin dressed\r\nwithout the hair. sometimes in the winter they make them of buffaloe\r\nskin dressed with the hair on and turn the hair inwards as the Mandans\r\nMinetares and most of the nations do who inhabit the buffaloe country.\r\nthe mockerson is formed with one seem on the outer edge of the foot is\r\ncut open at the instep to admit the foot and sewed up behind. in this\r\nrispect they are the same with the Mandans. they sometimes ornament\r\ntheir mockersons with various figures wrought with the quills of the\r\nPorcupine. some of the dressey young men orniment the tops of their\r\nmockersons with the skins of polecats and trale the tail of that animal\r\non the ground at their heels as they walk.the robe of the woman is\r\ngenerally smaller than that of the man but is woarn in the same manner\r\nover the sholders. the Chemise is roomy and comes down below the middle\r\nof the leg the upper part of this garment is formed much like the shirt\r\nof the men except the sholder strap which is never used with the\r\nChemise. in women who give suck, they are left open at the sides nearly\r\nas low as the waist, in others, close as high as the sleeve. the sleeve\r\nunderneath as low as the elbow is open, that part being left very full.\r\nthe sides tail and upper part of the sleeves are deeply fringed and\r\nsometimes ornimented in a similar manner with the shirts of the men\r\nwith the addition of little patches of red cloth about the tail edged\r\naround with beads. the breast is usually ornament with various figures\r\nof party colours rought with the quills of the Porcupine. it is on this\r\npart of the garment that they appear to exert their greatest ingenuity.\r\na girdle of dressed leather confines the Chemise around the waist. when\r\neither the man or woman wish to disengage their arm from the sleeve\r\nthey draw it out by means of the opening underneath the arm an throw\r\nthe sleeve behind the body. the legings of the women reach as high as\r\nthe knee and are confined with a garter below. the mockerson covers and\r\nconfins it's lower extremity. they are neither fringed nor ornamented.\r\nthese legings are made of the skins of the antelope and the Chemise\r\nusually of those of the large deer Bighorn and the smallest elk.--They\r\nseldom wear the beads they possess about their necks at least I have\r\nnever seen a grown person of either sex wear them on this part; some\r\ntheir children are seen with them in this way. the men and women were\r\nthem suspen from the ear in little bunches or intermixed with\r\ntriangular peices of the shells of the perl oister. the men also were\r\nthem attached in a similar manner to the hare of the fore part of the\r\ncrown of the head; to which they sometimes make the addition of the\r\nwings and tails of birds. the nose in neither sex is pierced nor do\r\nthey wear any ornament in it. they have a variety of small sea shells\r\nof which they form collars woarn indiscriminately by both sexes. these\r\nas well as the shell of the perl oister they value very highly and\r\ninform us that they obtain them from their friends and relations who\r\nlive beyond the barren plain towards the Ocean in a S. Westerly\r\ndirection. these friends of theirs they say inhabit a good country\r\nabounding with Elk, deer, bear, and Antelope, and possess a much\r\ngreater number of horses and mules than they do themselves; or using\r\ntheir own figure that their horses and mules are as numerous as the\r\ngrass of the plains. the warriors or such as esteem themselves brave\r\nmen wear collars made of the claws of the brown bear which are also\r\nesteemed of great value and are preserved with great care. these claws\r\nare ornamented with beads about the thick end near which they are\r\npeirced through their sides and strung on a throng of dressed leather\r\nand tyed about the neck commonly with the upper edge of the tallon next\r\nthe breast or neck but sometimes are reversed. it is esteemed by them\r\nan act of equal celebrity the killing one of these bear or an enimy,\r\nand with the means they have of killing this animal it must really be a\r\nserious undertaking. the sweet sented grass which grows very abundant\r\non this river is either twisted or plaited and woarn around the neck in\r\nether sex, but most commonly by the men. they have a collar also woarn\r\nby either sex. it generally round and about the size of a man's finger;\r\nformed of leather or silk-grass twisted or firmly rolled and covered\r\nwith the quills of the porcupine of different colours. the tusks of the\r\nElk are pierced strung on a throng and woarn as an orniment for the\r\nneck, and is most generally woarn by the women and children. the men\r\nfrequently wear the skin of a fox or a broad strip of that of the otter\r\naround the forehead and head in form of a bando. they are also fond of\r\nthe feathers of the tail of the beautifull eagle or callumet birds with\r\nwhich they ornament their own hair and the tails and mains of their\r\nhorses. The dress of these people is quite as desent and convenient as\r\nthat of any nation of Indians I ever saw.\r\n\r\nThis morning early Capt. C. resumed his march; at the distance of five\r\nmiles he arrived at some brush lodges of the Shoshones inhabited by\r\nabout seven families here he halted and was very friendly received by\r\nthese people, who gave himself and party as much boiled salmon as they\r\ncould eat; they also gave him several dryed salmon and a considerable\r\nquantity of dryed chokecherries. after smoking with them he visited\r\ntheir fish wear which was abut 200 yds. distant. he found the wear\r\nextended across four channels of the river which was here divided by\r\nthree small islands. three of these channels were narrow, and were\r\nstoped by means of trees fallen across, supported by which stakes of\r\nwillow were driven down sufficiently near each other to prevent the\r\nsalmon from passing. about the center of each a cilindric basket of\r\neighteen or 20 feet in length terminating in a conic shape at it's\r\nlower extremity, formed of willows, was opposed to a small apperture in\r\nthe wear with it's mouth up stream to receive the fish. the main\r\nchannel of the water was conducted to this basket, which was so narrow\r\nat it's lower extremity that the fish when once in could not turn\r\nitself about, and were taken out by untying the small ends of the\r\nlongitudinal willows, which frormed the hull of the basket. the wear in\r\nthe main channel was somewhat differently contrived. there were two\r\ndistinct wears formed of poles and willow sticks, quite across the\r\nriver, at no great distance from each other. each of these, were\r\nfurnished with two baskets; the one wear to take them ascending and the\r\nother in decending. in constructing these wears, poles were first tyed\r\ntogether in parcels of three near the smaller extremity; these were set\r\non end, and spread in a triangular form at the base, in such manner,\r\nthat two of the three poles ranged in the direction of the intended\r\nwork, and the third down the stream. two ranges of horizontal poles\r\nwere next lashed with willow bark and wythes to the ranging poles, and\r\non these willow sticks were placed perpendicularly, reaching from the\r\nbottom of the river to about 3 or four feet above it's surface; and\r\nplaced so near each other, as not to permit the passage of the fish,\r\nand even so thick in some parts, as with the help of gravel and stone\r\nto give a direction to the water which they wished.--the baskets were\r\nthe same in form of the others. this is the form of the work, and\r\ndisposition of the baskets.\r\n\r\nAfter examining the wears Capt. C. returned to the lodges, and shortly\r\ncontinued his rout and passed the river to the Lard. side a little\r\ndistance below the wears. he sent Collins with an Indian down the Lard.\r\nside of the river to the forks 5 me. in surch of Cruzatte who was left\r\nat the upper camp yesterday to purchase a horse and had followed on\r\ntoday and passed them by another road while they were at the lodges and\r\nhad gone on to the forks. while Capt. Clark was at these lodges an\r\nIndian brought him a tomehawk which he said he found in the grass near\r\nthe lodge where I had staid at the upper camp when I was first with his\r\nnation the tommahawk was Drewyer's he missed it in the morning before\r\nwe had set out and surched for it but it was not to be found I beleive\r\nthe young fellow stole it, but if he did it is the only article they\r\nhave pilfered and this was now returned. Capt. C. after traveling about\r\n20 miles through the valley with the course of the river nearly N. W.\r\nencamped on the Stard. side in a small bottom under a high Clift of\r\nrocks. on his way one of the party killed a very large Salmon in a\r\ncreek which they passed at the distance of 14 ms. he was joined this\r\nevening by Cruzatte and Collins who brought with them five fresh salmon\r\nwhich had been given them by the Indians at the forks. the forks of\r\nthis river is famous as a gig fishery and is much resorted by the\r\nnatives.--They killed one deer today. The Guide apeared to be a very\r\nfriendly intelligent old man, Capt. C. is much pleased with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 21, 1805]\r\nAugust 21st Wednesday 1805\r\nFrost last night proceeded on with the Indians I met about 5 miles to\r\nthere Camp, I entered a lodge and after Smokeing with all who Came\r\nabout me I went to See the place those people take the fish, a wear\r\nacross the Creek in which there is Stuk baskets Set in different\r\nderections So as to take the fish either decending or assending on my\r\nreturn to the Camp which was 200 yards only the different lodges (which\r\nis only bushes) brought in to the lodge I was introduced into, Sammon\r\nboiled, and dried Choke Chers. Sufficent for all my party.--one man\r\nbrought me a tomahawk which we expected they had Stolen from a man of\r\nCapt Lewis's party, this man informed me he found the tomk in the grass\r\nnear the place the man Slept. Crossed the River and went over a point\r\nof high land & Struck it again near a Bluff on the right Side the man I\r\nleft to get a horse at the upper Camp missed me & went to the forks\r\nwhich is about five miles below the last Camp.\r\n\r\nI sent one man by the forks with derections to join me to night with\r\nthe one now at that place, those two men joined me at my Camp on the\r\nright Side below the 1st Clift with 5 Sammon which the Indians gave\r\nthem at the forks, the place they gig fish at this Season. Their method\r\nof takeing fish with a gig or bone is with a long pole, about a foot\r\nfrom one End is a Strong String attached to the pole, this String is a\r\nlittle more than a foot long and is tied to the middle of a bone from 4\r\nto 6 inches long, one end Sharp the other with a whole to fasten on the\r\nend of the pole with a beard to the large end, the fasten this bone on\r\none end & with the other, feel for the fish & turn and Strike them So\r\nhard that the bone passes through and Catches on the opposit Side,\r\nSlips off the End of the pole and holds the Center of the bone Those\r\nIndians are mild in their disposition appear Sincere in their\r\nfriendship, punctial, and decided. kind with what they have, to Spare.\r\nThey are excessive pore, nothing but horses there Enemies which are\r\nnoumerous on account of there horses & Defenceless Situation, have\r\nDeprived them of tents and all the Small Conveniances of life. They\r\nhave only a few indifferent Knives, no ax, make use of Elk's horn\r\nSharpened to Spit ther wood, no clothes except a Short Legins & robes\r\nof different animals, Beaver, Bear, Buffalow, wolf Panthor, Ibex, Sheep\r\nDeer, but most commonly the antilope Skins which they ware loosely\r\nabout them--Their ornements are Orter Skin dcurated with See Shells &\r\nthe Skins & tales of the white weasel, Sea Shels of different size hung\r\nto their Ears hair and breast of their Shirts, beeds of Shells platted\r\ngrass, and Small Strings of otter Skin dressed, they are fond of our\r\ntrinkets, and give us those ornements as the most valueable of their\r\npossession. The women are held Sacred and appear to have an equal Shere\r\nin all Conversation, which is not the Case in any othe nation I have\r\nSeen. their boeys & Girls are also admited to Speak except in Councils,\r\nthe women doe all the drugery except fishing and takeing care of the\r\nhorses, which the men apr. to take upon themselves.--The men ware the\r\nhair loose flowing over ther Sholders & face the women Cut Short,\r\norniments of the back bones of fish Strung plated grass grains of Corn\r\nStrung Feathers and orniments of Birds Claws of the Bear encurcling\r\ntheir necks the most Sacred of all the orniments of this nation is the\r\nSea Shells of various Sizes and Shapes and colours, of the bassterd\r\nperl kind, which they inform us they get from the Indians to the South\r\non the other Side of a large fork of this river in passing to which\r\nthey have to pass thro Sandy & barron open plains without water to\r\nwhich place they can travel in 15 or 20 days--The men who passed by the\r\nforks informed me that the S W. fork was double the Size of the one I\r\ncame down, and I observed that it was a handsom river at my camp I\r\nshall injustice to Capt Lewis who was the first white man ever on this\r\nfork of the Columbia Call this Louis's river. one Deer killed this\r\nmorning, and a Sammon in the last Creek 21/2 feet long The Westerley\r\nfork of the Columbia River is double the Size of the Easterley fork &\r\nbelow those forks the river is about the Size Jeffersons River near its\r\nmouth or 100 yards wide, it is verry rapid & Sholey water Clear but\r\nlittle timber. This Clift is of a redish brown Colour the rocks which\r\nfall from it is a dark brown flint tinged with that Colour. Some\r\nGullies of white Sand Stone and Sand fine & as white as Snow. The\r\nmountains on each Side are high, and those on the East ruged & Contain\r\na fiew Scattering pine, those on the West contain pine on ther tops &\r\nhigh up the hollows--The bottoms of this is wide & rich from some\r\ndistance above the place I struck the East fork they are also wide on\r\nthe East Passed a large Creek which fall in on the right Side 6 miles\r\nbelow the forks a road passes up this Creek & to the Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 22, 1805]\r\nThursday August 22ed 1805\r\nThis morning early I sent a couple of men to complete the covering of\r\nthe cash which could not be done well last night in the dark, they soon\r\naccomplished their work and returned. late last night Drewyer returned\r\nwith a fawn he had killed and a considerable quantity of Indian\r\nplunder. the anecdote with rispect to the latter is perhaps worthy of\r\nrelation. he informed me that while hunting in the Cove yesterday about\r\n12 OCk. he came suddonly upon an Indian Camp, at which there were a\r\nyoung man an Old man a boy and three women, that they seemed but little\r\nsupprised at seeing him and he rode up to them and dismounted turning\r\nhorse out to graize. these people had just finished their repast on\r\nsome roots, he entered into conversation with them by signs, and after\r\nabout 20 minutes one of the women spoke to the others of the party and\r\nthey all went immediately and collected their horses brought them to\r\ncamp and saddled them at this moment he thought he would also set out\r\nand continue his hunt, and accorgingly walked to catch his horse at\r\nsome little distance and neglected to take up his gun which, he left at\r\ncamp. the Indians perceiving him at the distance of fifty paces\r\nimmediately mounted their horses, the young man took the gun and the\r\nwhole of them left their baggage and laid whip to their horses\r\ndirecting their course to the pass of the mountains. finding himself\r\ndeprived of his gun he immediately mounted his horse and pursued; after\r\nruning them about 10 miles the horses of two of the women nearly gave\r\nout and the young fellow with the gun from their frequent crys\r\nslackened his pace and being on a very fleet horse road around the\r\nwomen at a little distance at length Drewer overtook the women and by\r\nsigns convinced them that he did not wish to hirt them they then halted\r\nand the young fellow approached still nearer, he asked him for his gun\r\nbut the only part of the answer which he could understand was pah kee\r\nwhich he knew to be the name by which they called their enimies.\r\nwatching his opportunity when the fellow was off his guard he suddonly\r\nrode along side of him seized his gun and wrest her out of his hands.\r\nthe fellow finding Drewyer too strong for him and discovering that he\r\nmust yeald the gun had pesents of mind to open the pan and cast the\r\npriming before he let the gun escape from his hands; now finding\r\nhimself devested of the gun he turned his horse about and laid whip\r\nleaving the women to follow him as well as they could. Drewyer now\r\nreturned to the place they had left their baggage and brought it with\r\nhim to my camp. it consisted of several dressed and undressed skins; a\r\ncouple of bags wove with the fingers of the bark of the silk-grass\r\ncontaining each about a bushel of dryed service berries some checherry\r\ncakes and about a bushel of roots of three different kinds dryed and\r\nprepared for uce which were foalded in as many parchment hides of\r\nbuffaloe. some flint and the instrument of bone for manufactureing the\r\nflint into arrow points. some of this flint was as transparent as the\r\ncommon black glass and much of the same colour easily broken, and\r\nflaked off much like glass leaving a very sharp edge. one speceis of\r\nthe roots were fusiform abot six inches long and about the size of a\r\nman's finger at the larger end tapering to a small point. the radicles\r\nlarger than in most fusiform roots. the rind was white and thin. the\r\nbody or consistence of the root was white mealy and easily reduced by\r\npounding to a substance resembleing flour which thickens with boiling\r\nwater something like flour and is agreeably flavored. this rout is\r\nfrequently eaten by the Indians either green or in it's dryed state\r\nwithout the preparation of boiling. another speceis was much mutilated\r\nbut appeared to be fibrous; the parts were brittle, hard of the size of\r\na small quill, cilindric and as white as snow throughout, except some\r\nsmall parts of the hard black rind which they had not seperated in the\r\npreperation. this the Indians with me informed were always boiled for\r\nuse. I made the exprement, found that they became perfectly soft by\r\nboiling, but had a very bitter taste, which was naucious to my pallate,\r\nand I transfered them to the Indians who had eat them heartily. a third\r\nspeceis were about the size of a nutmeg, and of an irregularly rounded\r\nform, something like the smallest of the Jerusalem artichoke, which\r\nthey also resemble in every other appearance. they had become very hard\r\nby being dryed these I also boiled agreeably to the instruction of the\r\nIndians and found them very agreeable. they resemble the Jerusalem\r\nArtichoke very much in their flavor and I thought them preferable,\r\nhowever there is some allowance to be made for the length of time I\r\nhave now been without vegitable food to which I was always much\r\nattatched. these are certainly the best root I have yet seen in uce\r\namong the Indians. I asked the Indians to shew me the plant of which\r\nthese roots formed a part but they informed me that neither of them\r\ngrew near this place. I had set most of the men at work today to dress\r\nthe deerskin belonging to those who had gone on command with Capt.\r\nClark. at 11 A.M. Charbono the Indian Woman, Cameahwait and about 50\r\nmen with a number of women and children arrived. they encamped near us.\r\nafter they had turned out their horses and arranged their camp I called\r\nthe Cheifs and warriors together and addressed them a second time; gave\r\nthem some further presents, particularly the second and third Cheifs\r\nwho it appeared had agreeably to their promise exerted themselves in my\r\nfavour. having no fresh meat and these poor devils half starved I had\r\npreviously prepared a good meal for them all of boiled corn and beans\r\nwhich I gave them as soon as the council was over and I had distributed\r\nthe presents. this was thankfully received by them. the Chief wished\r\nthat his nation could live in a country where they could provide such\r\nfood. I told him that it would not be many years before the whitemen\r\nwould put it in the power of his nation to live in the country below\r\nthe mountains where they might cultivate corn beans and squashes. he\r\nappeared much pleased with the information. I gave him a few dryed\r\nsquashes which we had brought from the Mandans he had them boiled and\r\ndeclared them to be the best thing he had ever tasted except sugar, a\r\nsmall lump of which it seems his sister Sah-cah-gar Wea had given him.\r\nlate in the evening I made the men form a bush drag, and with it in\r\nabout 2 hours they caught 528 very good fish, most of them large trout.\r\namong them I now for the first time saw ten or a douzen of a whte\r\nspeceis of trout. they are of a silvery colour except on the back and\r\nhead, where they are of a bluish cast. the scales are much larger than\r\nthe speckled trout, but in their form position of their fins teeth\r\nmouth &c they are precisely like them they are not generally quite as\r\nlarge but equally well flavored. I distributed much the greater portion\r\nof the fish among the Indians. I purchased five good horses of them\r\nvery reasonably, or at least for about the value of six dollars a peice\r\nin merchandize. the Indians are very orderly and do not croud about our\r\ncamp nor attempt to disterb any article they see lying about. they\r\nborrow knives kettles &c from the men and always carefully return them.\r\nCapt. Clark says, \"we set out early and passed a small creek at one\r\nmile, also the points of four mountains which were high steep and\r\nrocky. the mountains are so steep that it is almost incredible to\r\nmention that horses had passed them. our road in many places lay over\r\nthe sharp fragments of rocks which had fallen from the mountains and\r\nlay in confused heaps for miles together; yet notwithstanding our\r\nhorsed traveled barefoot over them as fast as we could and did not\r\ndetain us. passed two bold runing streams, and arrived at the entrance\r\nof a small river\" where some Indian families resided. they had some\r\nscaffoalds of fish and burries exposed to dry. they were not acquainted\r\nwith the circumstance of any whitemen being in their country and were\r\ntherefore much allarmed on our approach several of the women and\r\nchildren fled in the woods for shelter. the guide was behind and the\r\nwood thick in which their lodges were situated we came on them before\r\nthey had the least notice of us. those who remained offered us every\r\nthing they had, which was but little; they offered us collars of elks\r\ntusks which their children woar Salmon beries &c. we eat some of their\r\nfish and buries but returned them the other articles they had offered\r\nwith a present of some small articles which seemed to add much to their\r\npacification.\r\n\r\nThe guide who had by this time arrived explained to them who we were\r\nand our object in visiting them; but still there were some of the women\r\nand Children inconsoleable, they continued to cry during our stay,\r\nwhich was about an hour. a road passes up this river which my guide\r\ninformed me led over the mountains to the Missouri. from this place I\r\ncontinued my rout along the steep side of a mountain for about 3 miles\r\nand arrived at the river near a small Island on the lower point of\r\nwhich we encamped in the evening we attempted to gig fish but were\r\nunsuccessfull only obtaining one small salmon. in the course of the day\r\nwe had passed several women and children geathering burries who were\r\nvery liberal in bestoing us a part of their collections. the river is\r\nvery rapid and shoaly; many rocks lie in various derections scattered\r\nthroughout it's bed. There are some few small pine scattered through\r\nthe bottoms, of which I only saw one which appeared as if it would\r\nanswer for a canoe and that was but small. the tops of the mountains on\r\nthe Lard. side are covered with pine and some also scattered on the\r\nsides of all the mountains. I saw today a speceis of woodpecker, which\r\nfed on the seeds of the pine. it's beak and tail were white, it's wings\r\nwere black, and every other part of a dark brown. it was about the size\r\nof a robin-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 22, 1805]\r\nAugust 22d Thursday 1805\r\nWe Set out early passed a Small Creek on the right at 1 mile and the\r\npoints of four mountains verry Steap high & rockey, the assent of three\r\nwas So Steap that it is incrediable to describe the rocks in maney\r\nplaces loose & Sliped from those mountains and is a bed of rugid loose\r\nwhite and dark brown loose rock for miles. the Indian horses pass over\r\nthose Clifts hills Sids & rocks as fast as a man, the three horses with\r\nme do not detain me any on account of those dificuelties, passed two\r\nbold rung. Streams on the right and a Small river at the mouth of Which\r\nSeveral families of Indians were encamped and had Several Scaffolds of\r\nfish & buries drying we allarmed them verry much as they knew nothing\r\nof a white man being in their Countrey, and at the time we approached\r\ntheir lodges which was in a thick place of bushes-my guiedes were\r\nbehind.--They offered every thing they possessed (which was verry\r\nlittl) to us, Some run off and hid in the bushes The first offer of\r\ntheirs were Elks tuskes from around their Childrens necks, Sammon &c.\r\nmy guide attempted passifyed those people and they Set before me\r\nberres, & fish to eate, I gave a fiew Small articles to those fritened\r\npeople which added verry much to their pasification but not entirely as\r\nSome of the women & Childn. Cried dureing my Stay of an hour at this\r\nplace, I proceeded on the Side of a verry Steep & rockey mountain for 3\r\nmiles and Encamped on the lower pt. of an Island. we attempted to gig\r\nfish without Suckcess. caught but one Small one.The last Creek or Small\r\nriver is on the right Side and \"a road passes up it & over to the\r\nMissouri\" in this day passed Several womin and Children gathering and\r\ndrying buries of which they were very kind and gave us a part. the\r\nriver rapid and Sholey maney Stones Scattered through it in different\r\ndirections. I Saw to day Bird of the wood pecker kind which fed on Pine\r\nburs its Bill and tale white the wings black every other part of a\r\nlight brown, and about the Size of a robin. Some fiew Pine Scattered in\r\nthe bottoms & Sides of the Mountains (the Top of the Motn. to the left\r\nCovered & inaxcessable) I Saw one which would make a Small Canoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 23, 1805]\r\nFriday August 23rd 1805.\r\nThis morning I arrose very early and despatched two hunters on\r\nhorseback with orders to extend their hunt to a greater distance up the\r\nS. E. fork than they had done heretofore, in order if possible to\r\nobtain some meet for ourselves as well as the Indians who appeared to\r\ndepend on us for food and our store of provision is growing too low to\r\nindulge them with much more corn or flour. I wished to have set out\r\nthis morning but the cheef requested that I would wait untill another\r\nparty of his nation arrived which he expected today, to this I\r\nconsented from necessity, and therefore sent out the hunters as I have\r\nmentioned. I also laid up the canoes this morning in a pond near the\r\nforks; sunk them in the water and weighted them down with stone, after\r\ntaking out the plugs of the gage holes in their bottoms; hoping by this\r\nmeans to guard against both the effects of high water, and that of the\r\nfire which is frequently kindled in these plains by the natives. the\r\nIndians have promised to do them no intentional injury and beleive they\r\nare too lazy at any rate to give themselves the trouble to raise them\r\nfrom their present situation in order to cut or birn them. I reminded\r\nthe chief of the low state of our stores of provision and advised him\r\nto send his young men to hunt, which he immediately recommended to them\r\nand most of them turned out. I wished to have purchased some more\r\nhorses of them but they objected against disposing of any more of them\r\nuntill we reach their camp beyond the mountains. the Indians pursued a\r\nmule buck near our camp I saw this chase for about 4 miles it was\r\nreally entertaining, there were about twelve of them in pursuit of it\r\non horseback, they finally rode it down and killed it. the all came in\r\nabout 1 P.M. having killed 2 mule deer and three goats. this mule buck\r\nwas the largest deer of any kind I had ever seen. it was nearly as\r\nlarge as a doe Elk. I observed that there was but little division or\r\ndistribution of the meat they had taken among themselves. some familes\r\nhad a large stock and others none. this is not customary among the\r\nnations of Indians with whom I have hitherto been acquainted I asked\r\nCameahwait the reason why the hunters did not divide the meat among\r\nthemselves; he said that meat was so scarce with them that the men who\r\nkilled it reserved it for themselves and their own families. my hunters\r\narrived about 2 in the evening with two mule deer and three common\r\ndeer. I distributed three of the deer among those families who appeared\r\nto have nothing to eat. at three P.M. the expected party of Indians\r\narrived, about 50 men women and Children. I now learnt that most of\r\nthem were thus far on their way down the valley towards the buffaloe\r\ncountry, and observed that there was a good deel of anxiety on the part\r\nof some of those who had promised to assist me over the mountains to\r\naccompany this party, I felt some uneasiness on this subject but as\r\nthey still said they would return with me as they had promised I said\r\nnothing to them but resolved to set out in the morning as early as\r\npossible. I dispatched two hunters this evening into the cove to hunt\r\nand leave the meat they might kill on the rout we shall pass tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe metal which we found in possession of these people consited of a\r\nfew indifferent knives, a few brass kettles some arm bands of iron and\r\nbrass, a few buttons, woarn as ornaments in their hair, a spear or two\r\nof a foot in length and some iron and brass arrow points which they\r\ninformed me they obtained in exchange for horses from the Crow or Rocky\r\nMountain Indians on the yellowstone River. the bridlebits and stirrips\r\nthey obtained from the Spaniards, tho these were but few. many of them\r\nmade use of flint for knives, and with this instrument, skined the\r\nanimals they killed, dressed their fish and made their arrows; in short\r\nthey used it for every purpose to which the knife is applyed. this\r\nflint is of no regular form, and if they can only obtain a part of it,\r\nan inch or two in length that will cut they are satisfyed, they renew\r\nthe edge by fleaking off the flint by means of the point of an Elk's or\r\ndeer's horn. with the point of a deer or Elk's horn they also form\r\ntheir arrow points of the flint, with a quickness and neatness that is\r\nreally astonishing. we found no axes nor hatchets among them; what wood\r\nthey cut was done either with stone or Elk's horn. the latter they use\r\nalways to rive or split their wood. their culinary eutensils exclusive\r\nof the brass kettle before mentioned consist of pots in the form of\r\najar made either of earth, or of a white soft stone which becomes black\r\nand very hard by birning, and is found in the hills near the three\r\nforks of the Missouri betwen Madison's and Gallitin's rivers they have\r\nalso spoons made of the Buffaloe's horn and those of the Bighorn. Their\r\nbows are made of ceader or pine and have nothing remarkable about them.\r\nthe back of the bow is covered with sinues and glue and is about 21/2\r\nfeet long. much the shape of those used by the Siouxs Mandans\r\nMinnetares &c. their arrows are more slender generally than those used\r\nby the nations just mentioned but much the same in construction. Their\r\nSheild is formed of buffaloe hide, perfectly arrow proof, and is a\r\ncircle of 2 feet 4 I. or 2 F. 6 I. in diameter. this is frequently\r\npainted with varios figures and ornamented around the edges with\r\nfeather and a fringe of dressed leather. they sometimes make bows of\r\nthe Elk's horn and those also of the bighorn. those of the Elk's horn\r\nare made of a single peice and covered on the back with glue and sinues\r\nlike those made of wood, and are frequently ornamented with a stran\r\nwrought porcupine quills and sinues raped around them for some distance\r\nat both extremities. the bows of the bighorn are formed of small peices\r\nlaid flat and cemented with gleue, and rolled with sinews, after which,\r\nthey are also covered on the back with sinews and glew, and highly\r\nornamented as they are much prized. forming the sheild is a cerimony of\r\ngreat importance among them, this implement would in their minds be\r\ndevested of much of its protecting power were it not inspired with\r\nthose virtues by their old men and jugglers. their method of preparing\r\nit is thus, an entire skin of a bull buffaloe two years old is first\r\nprovided; a feast is next prepared and all the warriors old men and\r\njugglers invited to partake. a hole is sunk in the ground about the\r\nsame in diameter with the intended sheild and about 18 inches deep. a\r\nparcel of stones are now made red hot and thrown into the hole water is\r\nnext thrown in and the hot stones cause it to emit a very strong hot\r\nsteem, over this they spread the green skin which must not have been\r\nsuffered to dry after taken off the beast. the flesh side is laid next\r\nto the groround and as many of the workmen as can reach it take hold on\r\nit's edges and extend it in every direction. as the skin becomes\r\nheated, the hair seperates and is taken of with the fingers, and the\r\nskin continues to contract untill the whoe is drawn within the compas\r\ndesigned for the shield, it is then taken off and laid on a parchment\r\nhide where they pound it with their heels when barefoot. this operation\r\nof pounding continues for several days or as long as the feast lasts\r\nwhen it is delivered to the propryeter and declared by the jugglers and\r\nold men to be a sufficient defence against the arrows of their enimies\r\nor even bullets if feast has been a satisfactory one. many of them\r\nbeleive implisitly that a ball cannot penitrate their sheilds, in\r\nconsequence of certain supernaural powers with which they have been\r\ninspired by their jugglers.--The Poggamoggon is an instrument with a\r\nhandle of wood covered with dressed leather about the size of a whip\r\nhandle and 22 inches long; a round stone of 2 pounds weight is also\r\ncovered with leather and strongly united to the leather of the handle\r\nby a throng of 2 inches long; a loop of leather united to the handle\r\npasses arond the wrist. a very heavy blow may be given with this\r\ninstrument. They have also a kind of armor which they form with many\r\nfoalds of dressed Atelope's skin, unite with glue and sand. with this\r\nthey cover their own bodies and those of their horses. these are\r\nsufficient against the effects of the arrow.--the quiver which contains\r\ntheir arrows and implements for making fire is formed of various skins.\r\nthat of the Otter seems to be prefered. they are but narrow, of a\r\nlength sufficent to protect the arrow from the weather, and are woarn\r\non the back by means of a strap which passes over the left sholder and\r\nunder the wright arm.their impliments for making fire is nothing more\r\nthan a blunt arrow and a peice of well seasoned soft spongey wood such\r\nas the willow or cottonwood. the point of this arrow they apply to this\r\ndry stick so near one edge of it that the particles of wood which are\r\nseperated from it by the friction of the arrow falls down by it's side\r\nin a little pile. the arrow is held between the palms of the hand with\r\nthe fingers extended, and being pressed as much as possible against the\r\npeice is briskly rolled between the palms of the hands backwards and\r\nforwards by pressing the arrow downwards the hands of course in rolling\r\narrow also decend; they bring them back with a quick motion and repeat\r\nthe operation till the dust by the friction takes fire; the peice and\r\narrow are then removed and some dry grass or Boated wood is added. it\r\nastonished me to see in what little time these people would kindle fire\r\nin this way. in less than a minute they will produce fire.\r\n\r\nCapt. Clark set out this morning very early and poroceeded but slowly\r\nin consequence of the difficulty of his road which lay along the steep\r\nside of a mountain over large irregular and broken masses of rocks\r\nwhich had tumbled from the upper part of the mountain. it was with much\r\nwrisk and pain that the horses could get on. at the distance of four\r\nmiles he arrived at the river and the rocks were here so steep and\r\njuted into the river such manner that there was no other alternative\r\nbut passing through the river, this he attempted with success tho water\r\nwas so deep for a short distance as to swim the horses and was very\r\nrapid; he continued his rout one mile along the edge of the river under\r\nthis steep Clift to a little bottom, below which the whole current of\r\nthe river beat against the Stard. shore on which he was, and which was\r\nformed of a solid rock perfectly inaccessible to horses. here also the\r\nlittle track which he had been pursuing, terminated. he therefore\r\ndetermined to leave the horses and the majority of the party here and\r\nwith his guide and three men to continue his rout down the river still\r\nfurther, in order more fully to satisfy himself as to it's\r\npracticability. accordingly he directed the men to hunt and fish at\r\nthis place untill his return. they had not killed anything today but\r\none goose, and the ballance of the little provision they had brought\r\nwith them, as well as the five salmon they had procured yesterday were\r\nconsumed last evening; there was of tours no inducement for his halting\r\nany time, at this place; after a few minutes he continued his rout\r\nclambering over immence rocks and along the sides of lofty precepices\r\non the border of the river to the distance of 12 miles, at which place\r\na large creek discharged itself on the Norh side 12 yds. wide and deep.\r\na short distance above the entrance of this creek there is a narrow\r\nbottom which is the first that he had found on the river from that in\r\nwhich he left the horses and party. a plain indian road led up this\r\ncreek which the guide informed him led to a large river that ran to the\r\nNorth, and was frequented by another nation who occasionally visited\r\nthis river for the purpose of taking fish. at this place he saw some\r\nlate appearance of Indians having been encamped and the tracks of a\r\nnumber of horses. Capt. C. halted here about 2 hours, caught some small\r\nfish, on which, with the addition of some berries, they dined. the\r\nriver from the place at which he left the party to his present station\r\nwas one continued rapid, in which there were five shoals neither of\r\nwhich could be passed with loaded canoes nor even run with empty ones.\r\nat those several places therefore it would be necessary to unload and\r\ntransport the baggage for a considerable distance over steep and almost\r\ninacassable rocks where there was no possibility of employing horses\r\nfor the releif of the men; the canoes would next have to be let down by\r\ncords and even with this precaution Capt. C. conceived there would be\r\nmuch wriske of both canoes and men. at one of those shoals the lofty\r\nperpendicular rocks which from the bases of the mountains approach the\r\nriver so nearly on each side, as to prevent the possibility of a\r\nportage, or passage for the canoes without expending much labour in\r\nremoving rocks and cuting away the earth in some places. to surmount\r\nThese difficulties, precautions must be observed which in their\r\nexecution must necessarily consume much time and provision, neither of\r\nwhich we can command. the season is now far advanced to remain in these\r\nmountains as the Indians inform us we shall shortly have snow; the\r\nsalmon have so far declined that they are themselves haistening from\r\nthe country and not an animal of any discription is to be seen in this\r\ndifficult part of the river larger than a pheasant or a squirrel and\r\nthey not abundant; add to this that our stock of provision is now so\r\nlow that it would not support us more than ten days. the bends of the\r\nriver are short and the currant beats from side to side against the\r\nrocks with great violence. the river is about 100 yds. wide and so deep\r\nthat it cannot be foarded but in a few places, and the rocks approach\r\nthe river so near in most places that there is no possibility of\r\npassing between them and the water; a passage therefore with horses\r\nalong the river is also impracticable. The sides of these mountains\r\npresent generally one barren surface of confused and broken masses of\r\nstone. above these are white or brown and towards the base of a grey\r\ncolour and so hard that when struck with a steel, yeald fire like\r\nflint. those he had just past were scarcely releived by the appearance\r\nof a tree; but those below the entrance of the creek were better\r\ncovered with timber, and there were also some tall pine near the river.\r\nThe sides of the mountains are very steep, and the torrents of water\r\nwhich roll down their sides at certain seasons appear to carry with\r\nthem vast quantities of the loose stone into the river. after dinner\r\nCapt. C. continued his rout down the river and at 1/2 a mile pased\r\nanother creek not so large as that just mentioned, or about 5 yards\r\nwide. here his guide informed him that by ascending this creek some\r\ndistance they would have a better road and would cut off a considerable\r\nbend which the river made to the south; accordingly he pursued a well\r\nbeaten Indian track which led up this creek about six miles, then\r\nleaving the creek on the wright he passed over a ridge, and at the\r\ndistance of a mile arrived at the river where it passes through a well\r\ntimbered bottom of about eighty acres of land; they passed this bottom\r\nand asscended a steep and elivated point of a mountain, from whence the\r\nguide shewed him the brake of the river through the mountains for about\r\n20 miles further. this view was terminated by one of the most lofty\r\nmountains, Capt. C. informed me, he had ever seen which was perfectly\r\ncovered with snow. the river directed it's course immediately to this\r\nstupendous mountain at the bace of which the gude informe him those\r\ndifficulties of which himself and nation had spoken, commenced. that\r\nafter the river reached this mountain it continued it's rout to the\r\nNorth for many miles between high and perpendicular rocks, roling\r\nfoaming and beating against innumerable rocks which crouded it's\r\nchannel; that then it penetrated the mountain through a narrow gap\r\nleaving a perpendicular rock on either side as high as the top of the\r\nmountain which he beheld. that the river here making a bend they could\r\nnot see through the mountain, and as it was impossible to decend the\r\nriver or clamber over that vast mountain covered with eternal snow,\r\nneither himself nor any of his nation had ever been lower in this\r\ndirection, than in view of the place at which the river entered this\r\nmountain; that if Capt. C. wished him to do so, he would conduct him to\r\nthat place, where he thought they could probably arrive by the next\r\nevening. Capt. C. being now perfictly satisfyed as to the\r\nimpractability of this rout either by land or water, informed the old\r\nman, that he was convinced of the varacity of his assertions and would\r\nnow return to the village from whence they had set out where he\r\nexpected to meet myself and party. they now returned to the upper part\r\nof the last creek he had passed, and encamped. it was an hour after\r\ndark before he reached this place. a small river falls into this fork\r\nof the Columbia just above the high mountain through which it passes on\r\nthe south side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 23, 1805]\r\nAugust 23rd Friday 1805\r\nWe Set out early proceed on with great dificuelty as the rocks were So\r\nSharp large and unsettled and the hill sides Steep that the horses\r\ncould with the greatest risque and dificulty get on, no provisions as\r\nthe 5 Sammons given us yesterday by the Indians were eaten last night,\r\none goose killed this morning; at 4 miles we came to a place the horses\r\nCould not pass without going into the river, we passed one mile to a\r\nverry bad riffle the water Confined in a narrow Channel & beeting\r\nagainst the left Shore, as we have no parth further and the Mounts. jut\r\nSo close as to prevent the possibiley of horses proceeding down, I\r\ndeturmined to delay the party here and with my guide and three men\r\nproceed on down to examine if the river continued bad or was\r\npractiable. I Set out with three men directing those left to hunt and\r\nfish until my return. I proceeded on Somtims in a Small wolf parth & at\r\nother times Climeing over the rocks for 12 miles to a large Creek on\r\nthe right Side above the mouth of this Creek for a Short distance is a\r\nnarrow bottom & the first, below the place I left my partey, a road\r\npasses down this Creek which I understoode passed to the water of a\r\nRiver which run to Th North & was the ground of another nation, Some\r\nfresh Sign about this Creek of horse and Camps. I delayd 2 hours to\r\nfish, Cought Some Small fish on which we dined.\r\n\r\nThe River from the place I left my party to this Creek is almost one\r\ncontinued rapid, five verry Considerable rapids the passage of either\r\nwith Canoes is entirely impossable, as the water is Confined betwen\r\nhugh Rocks & the Current beeting from one against another for Some\r\ndistance below &c. &c. at one of those rapids the mountains Close So\r\nClost as to prevent a possibility of a portage with great labour in\r\nCutting down the Side of the hill removeing large rocks &c. &c. all the\r\nothers may be passed by takeing every thing over Slipery rocks, and the\r\nSmaller ones Passed by letting down the Canoes empty with Cords, as\r\nrunning them would certainly be productive of the loss of Some Canoes,\r\nthose dificuelties and necessary precautions would delay us an emince\r\ntime in which provisions would be necessary. (we have but little and\r\nnothing to be precured in this quarter except Choke Cheres & red haws\r\nnot an animal of any kind to be seen and only the track of a Bear)\r\nbelow this Creek the lofty Pine is thick in the bottom hill Sides on\r\nthe mountains & up the runs. The river has much the resemblance of that\r\nabove bends Shorter and no passing, after a few miles between the river\r\n& the mountains & the Current So Strong that is dangerous crossing the\r\nriver, and to proceed down it would rendr it necessarey to Cross almost\r\nat every bend This river is about 100 yards wide and can be forded but\r\nin a few places. below my guide and maney other Indians tell me that\r\nthe Mountains Close and is a perpendicular Clift on each Side, and\r\nContinues for a great distance and that the water runs with great\r\nviolence from one rock to the other on each Side foaming & roreing thro\r\nrocks in every direction, So as to render the passage of any thing\r\nimpossible. those rapids which I had Seen he said was Small & trifleing\r\nin comparrison to the rocks & rapids below, at no great distance & The\r\nHills or mountains were not like those I had Seen but like the Side of\r\na tree Streight up--Those Mountains which I had passed were Steep\r\nContain a white, a brown, & low down a Grey hard stone which would make\r\nfire, those Stone were of different Sises all Sharp and are continuly\r\nSlipping down, and in maney places one bed of those Stones inclined\r\nfrom the river bottom to the top of the mountains, The Torrents of\r\nwater which come down aftr a rain carries with it emence numbers of\r\nthose Stone into the river about 1/2 a mile below the last mentioned\r\nCreek another Creek falls in, my guide informed me that our rout was up\r\nthis Creek by which rout we would Save a considerable bend of the river\r\nto the South. we proceeded on a well beeten Indian parth up this Creak\r\nabout 6 miles and passed over a ridge 1 mile to the river in a Small\r\nvally through which we passed and assended a Spur of the Mountain from\r\nwhich place my guide Shew me the river for about 20 miles lower &\r\npointed out the dificulty we returned to the last Creek & camped about\r\none hour after dark.\r\n\r\nThere my guide Shewed me a road from the N Which Came into the one I\r\nwas in which he Said went to a large river which run to the north on\r\nwhich was a Nation he called Tushapass, he made a map of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 24, 1805]\r\nSaturday August 24th 1805.\r\nAs the Indians who were on their way down the Missouri had a number of\r\nspare hoses with them I thought it probable that I could obtain some of\r\nthem and therefore desired the Cheif to speak to them and inform me\r\nwhether they would trade. they gave no positive answer but requested to\r\nsee the goods which I was willing to give in exchange. I now produced\r\nsome battle axes which I had made at Fort Mandan with which they were\r\nmuch pleased. knives also seemed in great demand among them. I soon\r\npurchased three horses and a mule. for each horse I gave an ax a knife\r\nhandkercheif and a little paint; & for the mule the addition of a knife\r\na shirt handkercheif and a pair of legings; at this price which was\r\nquite double that given for the horses, the fellow who sold him made a\r\nmerit of having bestoed me one of his mules. I consider this mule a\r\ngreat acquisition. These Indians soon told me that they had no more\r\nhorses for sale and I directed the party to prepare to set out. I had\r\nnow nine horses and a mule, and two which I had hired made twelve these\r\nI had loaded and the Indian women took the ballance of the baggage. I\r\nhad given the Interpreter some articles with which to purchase a horse\r\nfor the woman which he had obtained. at twelve Oclock we set out and\r\npassed the river below the forks, directing our rout towards the cove\r\nalong the track formerly mentioned. most of the horses were heavily\r\nladen, and it appears to me that it will require at least 25 horses to\r\nconvey our baggage along such roads as I expect we shall be obliged to\r\npass in the mountains. I had now the inexpressible satisfaction to find\r\nmyself once more under way with all my baggage and party. an Indian had\r\nthe politeness to offer me one of his horses to ride which I accepted\r\nwith cheerfullness as it enabled me to attend better to the march of\r\nthe party. I had reached the lower part of the cove when an Indian rode\r\nup and informed me that one of my men was very sick and unable to come\r\non. I directed the party to halt at a small run which falls into the\r\ncreek on Lard. at the lower part of the Cove and rode back about 2\r\nMiles where I found Wiser very ill with a fit of the cholic. I sent\r\nSergt. Ordway who had remained with him for some water and gave him a\r\ndoze of the essence of Peppermint and laudinum which in the course of\r\nhalf an hour so far recovered him that he was enabled to ride my horse\r\nand I proceeded on foot and rejoined the party. the sun was yet an hour\r\nhigh but the Indians who had for some time impatiently waited my return\r\nat length unloaded and turned out their horses and my party had\r\nfollowed there ex-ample. as it was so late and the Indians had prepared\r\ntheir camp for the night I thought it best to acquiess and determined\r\nalso to remain. we had traveled only about six miles. after we encamped\r\nwe had a slight shower of rain. Goodrich who is our principal fisherman\r\ncaught several fine trout. Drewyer came to us late in the evening and\r\nhad not killed anything. I gave the Indians who were absolutely engaged\r\nin transporting the baggage, a little corn as they had nothing to eat.\r\nI told Cameahwait that my stock of provision was too small to indulge\r\nall his people with provision and recommended it to him to advise such\r\nas were not assisting us with our baggage to go on to their camp to\r\nmorrow and wait our arrival; which he did accordingly. Cameahwait\r\nliterally translated is one who never walks. he told me that his nation\r\nhad also given him another name by which he was signalized as a warrior\r\nwhich was Too-et'-te-con'-e or black gun. these people have many names\r\nin the course of their lives, particularly if they become distinguished\r\ncharacters. for it seems that every important event by which they\r\nhappen to distinguish themselves intitles them to claim another name\r\nwhich is generally scelected by themselves and confirmed by the nation.\r\nthose distinguishing acts are the killing and scalping an enemy, the\r\nkilling a white bear, leading a party to war who happen to be\r\nsuccessfull either in destroying their enemies or robing them of their\r\nhorses, or individually stealing the horses of an enemy. these are\r\nconsidered acts of equal heroism among them, and that of killing an\r\nenemy without scalping him is considered of no importance; in fact the\r\nwhole honour seems to be founded in the act of scalping, for if a man\r\nhappens to slay a dozen of his enemies in action and others get the\r\nscalps or first lay their hand on the dead person the honor is lost to\r\nhim who killed them and devolves on those who scalp or first touch\r\nthem. Among the Shoshones, as well as all the Indians of America,\r\nbravery is esteemed the primary virtue; nor can any one become eminent\r\namong them who has not at some period of his life given proofs of his\r\npossessing this virtue. with them there can be no preferment without\r\nsome warelike achievement, and so completely interwoven is this\r\nprinciple with the earliest Elements of thought that it will in my\r\nopinion prove a serious obstruction to the restoration of a general\r\npeace among the nations of the Missouri. while at Fort Mandan I was one\r\nday addressing some cheifs of the Minetares wo visited us and pointing\r\nout to them the advantages of a state of peace with their neighbours\r\nover that of war in which they were engaged. the Chiefs who had already\r\ngeathered their havest of larals, and having forceably felt in many\r\ninstances some of those inconveniences attending a state of war which I\r\npointed out, readily agreed with me in opinon. a young fellow under the\r\nfull impression of the Idea I have just suggested asked me if they were\r\nin a state of peace with all their neighhours what the nation would do\r\nfor Cheifs?, and added that the cheifs were now oald and must shortly\r\ndie and that the nation could not exist without cheifs. taking as\r\ngranted that there could be no other mode devised for making Cheifs but\r\nthat which custom had established through the medium of warlike\r\nacievements.\r\n\r\nThe few guns which the Shoshones have are reserved for war almost\r\nexclusively and the bow and arrows are used in hunting. I have seen a\r\nfew skins among these people which have almost every appearance of the\r\ncommon sheep. they inform me that they finde this animals on the high\r\nmountains to the West and S. W. of them. it is about the size of the\r\ncommon sheep, the wool is reather shorter and more intermixed with long\r\nhairs particularly on the upper part of the neck. these skins have been\r\nso much woarn that I could not form a just Idea of the animal or it's\r\ncolour. the Indians however inform me that it is white and that it's\r\nhorns are lunated comprest twisted and bent backward as those of the\r\ncommon sheep. the texture of the skin appears to be that of the sheep.\r\nI am now perfectly convinced that the sheep as well as the Bighorn\r\nexist in these mountains.\r\n\r\nThe usual caparison of the Shoshone horse is a halter and saddle. the\r\n1st consists either of a round plated or twisted cord of six or seven\r\nstrands of buffaloe's hair, or a throng of raw hide made pliant by\r\npounding and rubing. these cords of bufaloe's hair are about the size\r\nof a man's finger and remarkably strong. this is the kind of halter\r\nwhich is prefered by them. the halter of whatever it may be composed is\r\nalways of great length and is never taken from the neck of the horse\r\nwhich they commonly use at any time. it is first attatched at one end\r\nabout the neck of the horse with a knot that will not slip, it is then\r\nbrought down to his under jaw and being passed through the mouth\r\nimbaces the under jaw and tonge in a simple noose formed by crossing\r\nthe rope inderneath the jaw of the horse. this when mounted he draws up\r\non the near side of the horse's neck and holds in the left hand,\r\nsuffering it to trail at a great distance behind him sometimes the\r\nhalter is attatched so far from the end that while the shorter end\r\nserves him to govern his horse, the other trails on the grond as before\r\nmentioned. they put their horses to their full speed with those cords\r\ntrailing on the ground. when they turn out the horse to graze the noose\r\nis mearly loosed from his mouth. the saddle is made of wood and covered\r\nwith raw hide which holds the parts very firmly together. it is made\r\nlike the pack saddles in uce among the French and Spaniards. it\r\nconsists of two flat thin boards which fit the sides of the horses\r\nback, and are held frirm by two peices which are united to them behind\r\nand before on the outer side and which rise to a considerable hight\r\nterminating sometimes in flat horizontal points extending outwards, and\r\nalwas in an accute angle or short bend underneath the upper part of\r\nthese peices. a peice of buffaloe's skin with the hair on, is usually\r\nput underneath the saddle; and very seldom any covering on the saddle.\r\nstirrups when used are made of wood and covered with leather. these are\r\ngenerally used by the elderly men and women; the young men scarcely\r\never use anything more than a small pad of dressed leather stuffed with\r\nhair, which is confined with a leather thong passing arond the body of\r\nthe horse in the manner of a girth. they frequently paint their\r\nfavorite horses, and cut their ears in various shapes. they also\r\ndecorate their mains and tails, which they never draw or trim, with the\r\nfeathers of birds, and sometimes suspend at the breast of the horse the\r\nfinest ornaments they possess. the Spanish bridle is prefered by them\r\nwhen they can obtain them, but they never dispence with the cord about\r\nthe neck of the horse, which serves them to take him with more ease\r\nwhen he is runing at large. They are excellent horsemen and extreemly\r\nexpert in casting the cord about the neck of a horse. the horses that\r\nhave been habituated to be taken with the cord in this way, however\r\nwild they may appear at first, surrender the moment they feel the cord\r\nabout their necks.--There are no horses in this quarter which can with\r\npropriety be termed wild. there are some few which have been left by\r\nthe indians at large for so great a length of time that they have\r\nbecome shye, but they all shew marks of having been in possession of\r\nman. such is that one which Capt. Clark saw just below the three forks\r\nof the Missouri, and one other which I saw on the Missouri below the\r\nentrance of the Mussle shell river.--Capt. Clark set out very early\r\nthis morning on his return, he traveled down the creek to it's entrance\r\nby the same Indian track he had ascended it; at the river he marked his\r\nname on a pine tree, then ascended to the bottom above the second\r\ncreek, and brekfasted on burries, which occupyed them about one hour.\r\nhe now retraced his former track and joined the party where he had left\r\nthem at 4 P.M. on his way Capt. C. fell from a rock and injured one of\r\nhis legs very much. the party during his absence had killed a few\r\npheasants and caught a few small fish on which together with haws and\r\nServiceburies they had subsisted. they had also killed one cock of the\r\nMountains Capt. Clark now wrote me a discription of the river and\r\ncountry, and stated our prospects by this rout as they have been\r\nheretofore mentioned and dispatched Colter on horseback with orders to\r\nloose no time reaching me. he set out late with the party continued his\r\nrout about two miles and encamped. Capt Clark had seen some trees which\r\nwould make small canoes but all of them some distance below the Indian\r\nCaps which he passed at the entrance of fish Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 24, 1805]\r\nAugust 24th Satturday 1805\r\nSet out verry early this morning on my return passed down the Creek at\r\nthe mouth marked my name on a pine Tree, proceed on to the bottom above\r\nthe Creek & Brackfast on buries & delayed 1 hour, then proceed on up\r\nthe river by the Same rout we decended to the place I left my party\r\nwhere we arrived at 4 oClock, (I Sliped & bruised my leg verry much on\r\na rock) the party had killed Several phesents and Cought a fiew Small\r\nfish on which they had Subsisted in my absence. also a heath hen, near\r\nthe Size of a Small turkey.\r\n\r\nI wrote a letter to Capt Lewis informing him of the prospects before us\r\nand information recved of my guide which I thought favourable &c. &\r\nStating two plans one of which for us to pursue &c. and despatched one\r\nman & horse and directed the party to get ready to march back, every\r\nman appeared disheartened from the prospects of the river, and nothing\r\nto eate, I Set out late and Camped 2 miles above, nothing to eate but\r\nChoke Cherries & red haws which act in different ways So as to make us\r\nSick, dew verry heavy, my beding wet in passing around a rock the\r\nhorses were obliged to go deep into the water.\r\n\r\nThe plan I stated to Capt Lewis if he agrees with me we shall adopt is\r\nto procure as many horses (one for each man) if possible and to hire my\r\npresent guide who I sent on to him to interegate thro the Intprtr. and\r\nproceed on by land to Some navagable part of the Columbia River, or to\r\nthe Ocean, depending on what provisions we can procure by the gun aded\r\nto the Small Stock we have on hand depending on our horses as the last\r\nresort.\r\n\r\na second plan to divide the party one part to attempt this deficuet\r\nriver with what provisions we had, and the remaindr to pass by Land on\r\nhose back Depending on our gun &c for Provisions &c. and come together\r\noccasionally on the river.\r\n\r\nthe 1s of which I would be most pleased with &c.\r\n\r\nI saw Several trees which would make Small Canoes and by putting 2\r\ntogether would make a Siseable one, all below the last Indian Camp\r\nSeveral miles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 25, 1805]\r\nSunday August 25th 1805.\r\nThis morning loaded our horses and set out a little after sunrise; a\r\nfew only of the Indians unengaged in assisting us went on as I had\r\nyesterday proposed to the Cheif. the others flanked us on each side and\r\nstarted some Antelope which they pursued for several hours but killed\r\nnone of them. we proceeded within 2 Ms. of the narrow pass or seven\r\nmiles from our camp of last evening and halted for dinner. Our hunters\r\njoined us at noon with three deer the greater part of which I gave the\r\nindians. sometime after we had halted, Charbono mentioned to me with\r\napparent unconcern that he expected to meet all the Indians from the\r\ncamp on the Columbia tomorrow on their way to the Missouri. allarmed at\r\nthis information I asked why he expected to meet them. he then informed\r\nme that the 1st Cheif had dispatched some of his young men this morning\r\nto this camp requesting the Indians to meet them tomorrow and that\r\nhimself and those with him would go on with them down the Missouri, and\r\nconsequently leave me and my baggage on the mountain or thereabouts. I\r\nwas out of patience with the folly of Charbono who had not sufficient\r\nsagacity to see the consequencies which would inevitably flow from such\r\na movement of the indians, and altho he had been in possession of this\r\ninformation since early in the morning when it had been communicated to\r\nhim by his Indian woman yet he never mentioned it untill the after\r\nnoon. I could not forbear speaking to him with some degree of asperity\r\non this occasion. I saw that there was no time to be lost in having\r\nthose orders countermanded, or that we should not in all probability\r\nobtain any more horses or even get my baggage to the waters of the\r\nColumbia. I therefore Called the three Cheifs together and having\r\nsmoked a pipe with them, I asked them if they were men of their words,\r\nand whether I could depent on the promises they had made me; they\r\nreadily answered in the affermative; I then asked them if they had not\r\npromised to assist me with my baggage to their camp on the other side\r\nof the mountains, or to the place at which Capt. Clark might build the\r\ncanoes, should I wish it. they acknowledged that they had. I then asked\r\nthem why they had requested their people on the other side of the\r\nmountain to meet them tomorrow on the mountain where there would be no\r\npossibility of our remaining together for the purpose of trading for\r\ntheir horses as they had also promised. that if they had not promised\r\nto have given me their assistance in transporting my baggage to the\r\nwaters on the other side of the mountain that I should not have\r\nattempted to pass the mountains but would have returned down the river\r\nand that in that case they would never have seen anymore white men in\r\ntheir country. that if they wished the white men to be their friends\r\nand to assist them against their enemies by furnishing them with arms\r\nand keeping their enemies from attacking them that they must never\r\npromis us anything which they did not mean to perform. that when I had\r\nfirst seen them they had doubted what I told them about the arrival of\r\nthe party of whitemen in canoes, that they had been convinced that what\r\nI told them on that occasion was true, why then would they doubt what I\r\nsaid on any other point. I told them that they had witnessed my\r\nliberality in dividing the meat which my hunters killed with them; and\r\nthat I should continue to give such of them as assisted me a part of\r\nwhatever we had ourselves to eat. and finally concluded by telling them\r\nif they intended to keep the promisses they had made me to dispatch one\r\nof their young men immediately with orders to their people to remain\r\nwhere they were untill our arrival. the two inferior cheifs said that\r\nthey wished to assist me and be as good as their word, and that they\r\nhad not sent for their people, that it was the first Chief who had done\r\nso, and they did not approve of the measure. Cameahwait remained silent\r\nfor some time, at length he told me that he knew he had done wrong but\r\nthat he had been induced to that measure from seeing all his people\r\nhungary, but as he had promised to give me his assistance he would not\r\nin future be worse than his word. I then desired him to send\r\nimmediately and countermand his orders; acordingly a young man was sent\r\nfor this purpose and I gave him a handkerchief to engage him in my\r\ninterest. this matter being arranged to my satisfaction I called all\r\nthe women and men together who had been assisting me in the\r\ntransportation of the baggage and gave them a billet for each horse\r\nwhich they had imployed in that service and informed them when we\r\narrived at the plaice where we should finally halt on the river I would\r\ntake the billet back and give them merchandize for it. every one\r\nappeared now satisfyed and when I ordered the horses loaded for our\r\ndeparture the Indians were more than usually allert. we continued our\r\nmarch untill late in the evening and encamped at the upper part of the\r\ncove where the creek enters the mountains; here our hunters joined us\r\nwith another deer which they had killed, this I gave to the women and\r\nChildren, and for my own part remained supperless. I observed\r\nconsiderable quantities of wild onions in the bottom lands of this\r\ncove. I also saw several large hares and many of the cock of the plains.\r\n\r\nCapt. Clark set out early this morning and continued his rout to the\r\nindian camp at the entrance of fish Creek; here he halted about an\r\nhour; the indians gave himself and party some boiled salmon and\r\nhurries. these people appeared extreemly hospitable tho poor and dirty\r\nin the extreem. he still pursued the track up the river by which he had\r\ndecended and in the evening arrived at the bluff on the river where he\r\nhad encamped on the 21st Inst. it was late in the evening before he\r\nreached this place. they formed their camp, and Capt. C. sent them in\r\ndifferent directions to hunt and fish. some little time after they\r\nhalted a party of Indians passed by on their way down the river,\r\nconsisting of a man a woman and several boys; from these people the\r\nguide obtained 2 salmon which together with some small fish they caught\r\nand a beaver which Shannon killed furnished them with a plentifull\r\nsupper. the pine grows pretty abundantly high up on the sides of the\r\nmountains on the opposite side of the river. one of the hunters saw a\r\nlarge herd of Elk on the opposite side of the river in the edge of the\r\ntimbered land.--Winsor was taken very sick today and detained Capt C.\r\nvery much on his march. three hunters whom he had sent on before him\r\nthis morning joined him in the evening having killed nothing; they saw\r\nonly one deer.\r\n\r\nThe course and the distances, of Capt. Clark's rout down this branch of\r\nthe Columbia below this bluff, commencing opposite to an Island, are as\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThis morning while passing through the Shoshone cove Frazier fired his\r\nmusquet at some ducks in a little pond at the distance of about 60\r\nyards from me; the ball rebounded from the water and pased within a\r\nvery few feet of me. near the upper part of this cove the Shoshonees\r\nsuffered a very severe defeat by the Minnetares about six years since.\r\nthis part of the cove on the N. E. side of the Creek has lately been\r\nbirned by the Indians as a signal on some occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 25, 1805]\r\nAugust 25th Sunday 1805\r\nSet out verry early and halted one hour at the Indian Camp, they were\r\nkind gave us all a little boiled Sarnmon & dried buries to eate, abt.\r\nhalf as much as I could eate, those people are kind with what they have\r\nbut excessive pore & Durtey.--we proceeded on over the mountains we had\r\nbefore passed to the Bluff we Encamped at on the 21s instant where we\r\narrived late and turned out to hunt & fish, Cought Several Small fish,\r\na party of Squars & one man with Several boys going down to guathe\r\nberries below, my guide got two Sammon from this party (which made\r\nabout half a Supper for the party), after Dark Shannon came in with a\r\nbeaver which the Party suped on Sumptiously--one man verry Sick to day\r\nwhich detained us verry much I had three hunters out all day, they saw\r\none Deer, killed nothing. one of the Party Saw 9 Elk on a Mountain to\r\nour right assending, amongst the Pine timber which is thick on that side\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 26, 1805]\r\nMonday August 26th 1805.\r\nThis morning was excessively cold; there was ice on the vessels of\r\nwater which stood exposed to the air nearly a quarter of an inch thick.\r\nwe collected our horses and set out at sunrise. we soon arrived at the\r\nextreem source of the Missouri; here I halted a few minutes, the men\r\ndrank of the water and consoled themselves with the idea of having at\r\nlength arrived at this long wished for point. from hence we proceeded\r\nto a fine spring on the side of the mountain where I had lain the\r\nevening before I first arrived at the Shoshone Camp. here I halted to\r\ndine and graize our horses, there being fine green grass on that part\r\nof the hillside which was moistened by the water of the spring while\r\nthe grass on the other parts was perfectly dry and parched with the\r\nsun. I directed a pint of corn to be given each Indian who was engaged\r\nin transporting our baggage and about the same quantity to each of the\r\nmen which they parched pounded and made into supe. one of the women who\r\nhad been assisting in the transportation of the baggage halted at a\r\nlittle run about a mile behind us, and sent on the two pack horses\r\nwhich she had been conducting by one of her female friends. I enquired\r\nof Cameahwait the cause of her detention, and was informed by him in an\r\nunconcerned manner that she had halted to bring fourth a child and\r\nwould soon overtake us; in about an hour the woman arrived with her\r\nnewborn babe and passed us on her way to the camp apparently as well as\r\nshe ever was. It appears to me that the facility and ease with which\r\nthe women of the aborigines of North America bring fourth their\r\nchildren is reather a gift of nature than depending as some have\r\nsupposed on the habitude of carrying heavy burthens on their backs\r\nwhile in a state of pregnancy. if a pure and dry air, an elivated and\r\ncold country is unfavourable to childbirth, we might expect every\r\ndifficult incident to that operation of nature in this part of the\r\ncontinent; again as the snake Indians possess an abundance of horses,\r\ntheir women are seldom compelled like those in other parts of the\r\ncontinent to carry burthens on their backs, yet they have their\r\nchildren with equal convenience, and it is a rare occurrence for any of\r\nthem to experience difficulty in childbirth. I have been several times\r\ninformed by those who were conversent with the fact, that the indian\r\nwomen who are pregnant by whitemen experience more difficulty in\r\nchildbirth than when pregnant by an Indian. if this be true it would go\r\nfar in suport of the opinion I have advanced.\r\n\r\nthe tops of the high and irregular mountains which present themselves\r\nto our view on the opposite side of this branch of the Columbia are yet\r\nperfectly covered with snow; the air which proceeds from those\r\nmountains has an agreeable coolness and renders these parched and South\r\nhillsides much more supportable at this time of the day it being now\r\nabout noon. I observe the indian women collecting the root of a speceis\r\nof fennel which grows in the moist grounds and feeding their poor\r\nstarved children; it is really distressing to witness the situation of\r\nthose poor wretches. the radix of this plant is of the knob kind, of a\r\nlong ovate form terminating in a single radicle, the whole bing about 3\r\nor four inches in length and the thickest part about the size of a\r\nman's little finger. it is white firm and crisp in it's present state,\r\nwhen dryed and pounded it makes a fine white meal; the flavor of this\r\nroot is not unlike that of annisseed but not so pungent; the stem rises\r\nto the hight of 3 or four feet is jointed smooth and cilindric; from r\r\nto 4 of those knobed roots are attatched to the base of this stem. the\r\nleaf is sheathing sessile, & pultipartite, the divisions long and\r\nnarrow; the whole is of a deep green. it is now in blame; the flowers\r\nare numerous, small, petals white, and are of the umbellaferous kind.\r\nseveral small peduncles put forth from the main stock one at each joint\r\nabove the sheathing leaf. it has no root leaves. the root of the\r\npresent year declines when the seeds have been matured and the\r\nsucceeding spring other roots of a similar kind put fourth from the\r\nlittle knot which unites the roots and stem and grow and decline with\r\nthe stem as before mentioned. The sunflower is very abundant near the\r\nwatercourses the seeds of this plant are now rip and the natives\r\ncollect them in considerable quantities and reduce them to meal by\r\npounding and rubing them between smooth stones. this meal is a favorite\r\nfood their manner of using it has been beforementiond. after dinner we\r\ncontinued our rout towards the village. on our near approach we were\r\nmet by a number of young men on horseback. Cameahwait requested that we\r\nwould discharge our guns when we arrived in sight of the Village,\r\naccordingly when I arrived on an eminence above the village in the\r\nplain I drew up the party at open order in a single rank and gave them\r\na runing fire discharging two rounds. they appeared much gratifyed with\r\nthis exhibition. we then proceeded to the village or encampment of\r\nbrush lodges 32 in number. we were conducted to a large lodge which had\r\nbeen prepared for me in the center of their encampmerit which was\r\nsituated in a beautifull level smooth and extensive bottom near the\r\nriver about 3 miles above the place I had first found them encamped.\r\nhere we arrived at 6 in the evening arranged our baggage near my tent\r\nand placed those of the men on either side of the baggage facing\r\noutwards. I found Colter here who had just arrived with a letter from\r\nCapt. Clark in which Capt. C. had given me an account of his\r\nperegrination and the description of the river and country as before\r\ndetailed from this view of the subject I found it a folly to think of\r\nattemping to decend this river in canoes and therefore to commence the\r\npurchase of horses in the morning from the indians in order to carry\r\ninto execution the design we had formed of passing the rocky Mountains.\r\nI now informed Cameahwait of my intended expedition overland to the\r\ngreat river which lay in the plains beyond the mountains and told him\r\nthat I wished to purchase 20 horses of himself and his people to convey\r\nour baggage. he observed that the Minnetares had stolen a great number\r\nof their horses this spring but hoped his people would spear me the\r\nnumber I wished. I also asked a guide, he observed that he had no doubt\r\nbut the old man who was with Capt. C. would accompany us if we wished\r\nhim and that he was better informed of the country than any of them.\r\nmatters being thus far arranged I directed the fiddle to be played and\r\nthe party danced very merily much to the amusement and gratification of\r\nthe natives, though I must confess that the state of my own mind at\r\nthis moment did not well accord with the prevailing mirth as I somewhat\r\nfeared that the caprice of the indians might suddenly induce them to\r\nwithhold their horses from us without which my hopes of prosicuting my\r\nvoyage to advantage was lost; however I determined to keep the indians\r\nin a good humour if possible, and to loose no time in obtaining the\r\nnecessary number of horses.

W. and widening as it appeared\r\nto extend to the W. through that plain the Indian informed us that the\r\nColumbia river, in which we were in surch run. this plain appeared to\r\nbe about 60 Miles distant, but our guide assured us that we should\r\nreach it's borders tomorrow the appearance of this country, our only\r\nhope for subsistance greately revived the sperits of the party already\r\nreduced and much weakened for the want of food. the country is thickly\r\ncovered with a very heavy growth of pine of which I have ennumerated 8\r\ndistinct species. after leaving the ridge we asscended and decended\r\nseveral steep mountains in the distance of 6 miles further when we\r\nstruck a Creek about 15 yards wide our course being S. 35 W. we\r\ncontinued our rout 6 miles along the side of this creek upwards passing\r\n2 of it's branches which flowed in from the N. 1st at the place we\r\nstruck the creek and the other 3 miles further. the road was\r\nexcessively dangerous along this creek being a narrow rockey path\r\ngenerally on the side of steep precipice, from which in many places if\r\nether man or horse were precipitated they would inevitably be dashed in\r\npieces.

I\r\nhave also observed two birds of a blue colour both of which I believe\r\nto be of the haulk or vulter kind. the one of a blue shining colour\r\nwith a very high tuft of feathers on the head a long tale, it feeds on\r\nflesh the beak and feet black. it's note is cha-ah, cha-ah. it is about\r\nthe size of a pigeon; and in shape and action resembles the jay bird.-\r\nanother bird of very similar genus, the note resembling the mewing of\r\nthe cat, with a white head and a light blue colour is also common, as\r\nare a black species of woodpecker about the size of the lark woodpecker\r\nThree species of Pheasants, a large black species, with some white\r\nfeathers irregularly scattered on the brest neck and belley a smaller\r\nkind of a dark uniform colour with a red stripe above the eye, and a\r\nbrown and yellow species that a good deel resembles the phesant common\r\nto the Atlantic States. we were detained this morning untill ten oclock\r\nin consequence of not being enabled to collect our horses. we had\r\nproceeded about 2 miles when we found the greater part of a horse which\r\nCapt Clark had met with and killed for us. he informed me by note that\r\nhe should proceed as fast as possible to the leavel country which lay\r\nto the S. W. of us, which we discovered from the hights of the\r\nmountains on the 19th there he intended to hunt untill our arrival. at\r\none oclock we halted and made a hearty meal on our horse beef much to\r\nthe comfort of our hungry stomachs. here I larnt that one of the\r\nPackhorses with his load was missing and immediately dispatched\r\nBaptiest Lapage who had charge of him, to surch for him. he returned at\r\n;3 OC. without the horse. The load of the horse was of considerable\r\nvalue consisting of merchandize and all my stock of winter cloathing.

Several men and woman offered Dogs and fish to Sell, we\r\npurchased all the dogs we could, the fish being out of Season and\r\ndieing in great numbers in the river, we did not think proper to use\r\nthem, Send out Hunters to Shute the Prarie Cock a large fowl which I\r\nhave only Seen on this river; Several of which I have killed, they are\r\nthe Size of a Small turkey, of the pheasant kind, one I killed on the\r\nwater edge to day measured from the Beek to the end of the toe 2 feet 6\r\n& 3/4 Inches; from the extremities of its wings 3 feet 6 inches; the\r\ntale feathers is 13 inches long; they feed on grasshoppers and the Seed\r\nof the wild plant which is also peculiar to this river and the upper\r\nparts of the Missoury somewhat resembling the whins-. Capt.

Shore on which two large Mat Lodges\r\nof Indians were drying Salmon, (as they informed me by Signs for the\r\npurpose of food and fuel, & I do not think at all improbable that those\r\npeople make use of Dried fish as fuel,) The number of dead Salmon on\r\nthe Shores & floating in the river is incrediable to Say and at this\r\nSeason they have only to collect the fish Split them open and dry them\r\non their Scaffolds on which they have great numbers, how far they have\r\nto raft their timber they make their Scaffolds of I could not lern; but\r\nthere is no timber of any Sort except Small willow bushes in Sight in\r\nany directionfrom this Island the natives showed me the enterance of a\r\nlarge Westerly fork which they Call Tapetett at about 8 miles distant,\r\nthe evening being late I deturmined to return to the forks, at which\r\nplace I reached at Dark. from the point up the Columbia River is N. 83°\r\nW. 6 miles to the lower point of an Island near the Lard.

Saw great numhers of Dead Salmon on the Shores and floating in\r\nthe water, great numbers of Indians on the banks viewing me and 18\r\ncanoes accompanied me from the point--The Waters of this river is\r\nClear, and a Salmon may be Seen at the deabth of 15 or 20 feet. West 4\r\nmiles to the lower point of a large Island near the Stard. Side at 2\r\nLodges, passed three large lodges on the Stard Side near which great\r\nnumber of Salmon was drying on Scaffolds one of those Mat lodges I\r\nentered found it crouded with men women and children and near the\r\nenterance of those houses I saw maney Squars engaged Splitting and\r\ndrying Salmon. I was furnished with a mat to Sit on, and one man Set\r\nabout prepareing me Something to eate, first he brought in a piece of a\r\nDrift log of pine and with a wedge of the elks horn, and a malet of\r\nStone curioesly Carved he Split the log into Small pieces and lay'd it\r\nopen on the fire on which he put round Stones, a woman handed him a\r\nbasket of water and a large Salmon about half Dried, when the Stones\r\nwere hot he put them into the basket of water with the fish which was\r\nSoon Suflicently boiled for use. it was then taken out put on a platter\r\nof rushes neetly made, and Set before me they boiled a Salmon for each\r\nof the men with me, dureing those preperations, I Smoked with those\r\nabout me who Chose to Smoke which was but fiew, this being a custom\r\nthose people are but little accustomed to and only Smok thro form.\r\nafter eateing the boiled fish which was delicious, I Set out & halted\r\nor came too on the Island at the two Lodges. Several fish was given to\r\nme, in return for Which I gave Small pieces of ribbond from those\r\nLodges the natives Showed me the mouth of Tap teel River about 8 miles\r\nabove on the west Side this western fork appears to beare nearly West,\r\nThe main Columbia river N W.--a range of high land to the S W and\r\nparralal to the river and at the distance of 2 miles on the Lard.

I can proceive\r\na range of mountains to the East which appears to bare N. & South\r\ndistant about 50 or 60 miles. no wood to be Seen in any derection--On\r\nmy return I was followd. by 3 canoes in which there was 20 Indians I\r\nshot a large Prairie Cock Several Grouse, Ducks and fish. on my return\r\nfound Great Numbr. of the nativs with Capt Lewis, men all employd in\r\ndressing ther Skins mending their clothes and putting ther arms in the\r\nbest order the latter being always a matter of attention with us. The\r\nDress of those natives differ but little from those on the Koskoskia\r\nand Lewis's rivers, except the women who dress verry different in as\r\nmuch as those above ware long leather Shirts which highly ornimented\r\nwith heeds Shells &c. &c. and those on the main Columbia river only\r\nware a truss or pece of leather tied around them at their hips and\r\ndrawn tite between ther legs and fastened before So as barly to hide\r\nthose parts which are So Sacredly hid & Scured by our women. Those\r\nwomen are more inclined to Copulency than any we have yet Seen, with\r\nlow Stature broad faces, heads flatened and the foward compressed so as\r\nto form a Streight line from the nose to the Crown of the head, their\r\neyes are of a Duskey black, their hair of a corse black without\r\norniments of any kind braded as above, The orniments of each Sects are\r\nSimilar, Such as large blue & white beeds, either pendant from their\r\nears or encircling their necks, or wrists & arms. they also ware\r\nbracelets of Brass, Copper & horn, and trinkets of Shells, fish bones\r\nand curious feathers. Their garments Consists of a short Shirt of\r\nleather and a roabe of the Skins of Deer or the Antilope but fiew of\r\nthem ware Shirts all have Short robes. Those people appears to live in\r\na State of comparitive happiness; they take a greater Share labor of\r\nthe woman, than is common among Savage tribes, and as I am informd.\r\nContent with one wife (as also those on the Ki moo e nim river) Those\r\npeople respect the aged with veneration, I observed an old woman in one\r\nof the Lodges which I entered She was entirely blind as I was informed\r\nby Signs, had lived more than 100 winters, She occupied the best\r\nposition in the house, and when She Spoke great attention was paid to\r\nwhat She Said-. Those people as also those of the flat heads which we\r\nhad passed on the Koskoske and Lewis's rivers are Subject to Sore eyes,\r\nand maney are blind of one and Some of both eyes. this misfortune must\r\nbe owing to the reflections of the Sun &c. on the waters in which they\r\nare continually fishing during the Spring Summer & fall, & the Snows\r\ndureing the, winter Seasons, in this open countrey where the eye has no\r\nrest. I have observed amongst those, as well in all other tribes which\r\nI have passed on these waters who live on fish maney of different\r\nSectes who have lost their teeth about middle age, Some have their\r\nteeth worn to the gums, perticelar those of the upper jaws, and the\r\ntribes generally have bad teeth the cause of it I cannot account sand\r\nattachd. to the roots &c the method they have of useing the dri'd\r\nSalmon, which is mearly worming it and eating the rine & Scales with\r\nthe flesh of the fish, no doubt contributes to it\r\n\r\nThe Houses or Lodges of the tribes of the main Columbia river is of\r\nlarge mats made of rushes, Those houses are from 15 to 60 feet in\r\nlength generally of an Oblong Squar form, Suported by poles on forks in\r\nthe iner Side, Six feet high, the top is covered also with mats\r\nleaveing a Seperation in the whole length of about 12 or 15 inches\r\nwide, left for the purpose of admitting light and for the Smok of the\r\nfire to pass which is made in the middle of the house.--The roughfs are\r\nnearly flat, which proves to me that rains are not common in this open\r\nCountrey\r\n\r\nThose people appeare of a mild disposition and friendly disposedThey\r\nhave in their huts independant of their nets gigs & fishing tackling\r\neach bows & large quivers of arrows on which they use flint Spikes.\r\nTheire ammusements are Similar to those of the Missouri. they are not\r\nbeggerley and receive what is given them with much joy.\r\n\r\nI saw but flew horses they appeared make but little use of those\r\nanimals principally useing Canoes for their uses of procureing food &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, October 18, 1805]\r\nOctober 18th Friday 1805\r\na cold morning faire & wind from S E Several Heath hens or large\r\nPheasents lit near us & the men killed Six of them.\r\n\r\nTook one altitude of the Suns upper Limb 28° 22' 15\" at h m s 8 1 24 A.M.\r\n\r\nSeveral Indian Canoes Come down & joind those with us, made a Second\r\nChief by giveing a meadel & wampom I also gave a String of wampom to\r\nthe old Chief who came down with us and informed the Indians of our\r\nviews and intentions in a council\r\n\r\nMeasured the width of the Columbia River, from the Point across to a\r\nPoint of view is S 22° W from the Point up the Columa to a Point of view\r\nis N. 84° W. 148 poles, thence across to the 1st point of view is S 281/2\r\nE\r\n\r\nMeasured the width of Ki moo e nim River, from the Point across to an\r\nobject on the opposit side is N. 411/2 E from the Point up the river is\r\nN. 8 E. 82 poles thence accross to the Point of view is N. 79° East\r\n\r\nDistance across the Columbia 9603/4 yds water\r\n\r\nDistance across the Ki-moo-e nim 575 yds water\r\n\r\nNames of this nation above the mouth of the Ki-moo-e-nim is So-Kulk\r\nPerced noses The Names of the nation on the Kimoenim River is\r\nChopun-nish Piercd noses at the Prarie the name of a nation at the\r\nSecond forks of the Tape tele River, or Nocktock fork Chim-na-pum, Some\r\nof which reside with the So kulkc above this-at and a few miles\r\ndistance,--4 men in a Canoe come up from below Stayed a fiew minits and\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nTook a meridian altitude 68° 57' 30\" the Suns upper Limb.

Side\r\nwhich appeared to Come from the S. E.--we landed at Some distance above\r\nthe mouth of this river and Capt. Lewis and my Self Set out to view\r\nthis river above its mouth, as our rout was intersepted by a deep\r\nnarrow Chanel which runs out of this river into the Columbia a little\r\nbelow the place we landed, leaveing a high dry rich Island of about 400\r\nyards wide and 800 yards long here we Seperated, I proceeded on to the\r\nriver and Struck it at the foot of a verry Considerable rapid, here I\r\nbeheld an emence body of water Compressd in a narrow Chanel of about\r\n200 yds in width, fomeing over rocks maney of which presented their\r\ntops above the water, when at this place Capt. Lewis joined me haveing\r\ndelayed on the way to examine a root of which the nativs had been\r\ndigging great quantities in the bottoms of this River. at about two\r\nmiles above this River appears to be confined between two high hils\r\nbelow which it divided by numbers of large rocks, and Small Islands\r\ncovered with a low groth of timber, and has a rapid as far as the\r\nnarrows three Small Islands in the mouth of this River, this River\r\nhaveing no Indian name that we could find out, except \"the River on\r\nwhich the Snake Indians live,\" we think it best to leave the nameing of\r\nit untill our return.\r\n\r\nwe proceeded on pass the mouth of this river at which place it appears\r\nto discharge 1/4 as much water as runs down the Columbia. at two miles\r\nbelow this River passed Eight Lodges on the Lower point of the Rock\r\nIsland aforesaid at those Lodges we saw large logs of wood which must\r\nhave been rafted down the To war-ne hi ooks River, below this Island on\r\nthe main Stard Shore is 16 Lodges of nativs; here we landed a fiew\r\nminits to Smoke, the lower point of one Island opposit which heads in\r\nthe mouth of Towarnehiooks River which I did not observe untill after\r\npassing these lodges about 1/2 a mile lower passed 6 more Lodges on the\r\nSame Side and 6 miles below the upper mouth of Towarnehiooks River the\r\ncomencement of the pitch of the Great falls, opposit on the Stard.

It may be proper here to remark that from Some obstruction below,\r\nthe cause of which we have not yet learned, the water in high fluds\r\n(which are in the Spring) rise below these falls nearly to a leavel\r\nwith the water above the falls; the marks of which can be plainly\r\ntrac'd around the falls. at that Stage of the water the Salmon must\r\npass up which abounds in Such great numbers above--below those falls\r\nare Salmon trout and great numbers of the heads of a Species of trout\r\nSmaller than the Salmon. those fish they catch out of the Salmon\r\nSeason, and are at this time in the act of burrying those which they\r\nhad drid for winter food. the mode of buring those fish is in holes of\r\nvarious Sizes, lined with Straw on which they lay fish Skins in which\r\nthey inclose the fish which is laid verry close, and then Covered with\r\nearth of about 12 or 15 inches thick. Capt Lewis and three men crossed\r\nthe river and on the opposit Side to view the falls which he had not\r\nyet taken a full view of--At 9 oClock a.m. I Set out with the party and\r\nproceeded on down a rapid Stream of about 400 yards wide at 21/2 miles\r\nthe river widened into a large bason to the Stard. Side on which there\r\nis five Lodges of Indians. here a tremendious black rock Presented\r\nitself high and Steep appearing to choke up the river nor could I See\r\nwhere the water passed further than the Current was drawn with great\r\nvelocity to the Lard Side of this rock at which place I heard a great\r\nroreing. I landed at the Lodges and the natives went with me to the top\r\nof this rock which makes from the Stard. Side; from the top of which I\r\ncould See the dificuelties we had to pass for Several miles below; at\r\nthis place the water of this great river is compressed into a Chanel\r\nbetween two rocks not exceeding forty five yards wide and continues for\r\na 1/4 of a mile when it again widens to 200 yards and continues this\r\nwidth for about 2 miles when it is again intersepted by rocks. This\r\nobstruction in the river accounts for the water in high floods riseing\r\nto Such a hite at the last falls. The whole of the Current of this\r\ngreat river must at all Stages pass thro this narrow chanel of 45 yards\r\nwide. as the portage of our canoes over this high rock would be\r\nimpossible with our Strength, and the only danger in passing thro those\r\nnarrows was the whorls and Swills arriseing from the Compression of the\r\nwater, and which I thought (as also our principal watermen Peter\r\nCrusat) by good Stearing we could pass down Safe, accordingly I detur\r\nmined to pass through this place notwithstanding the horrid appearance\r\nof this agitated gut Swelling, boiling & whorling in every direction\r\n(which from the top of the rock did not appear as bad as when I was in\r\nit;) however we passed Safe to the astonishment of all the Inds. of the\r\nlast Lodges who viewed us from the top of the rock. passed one Lodge\r\nbelow this rock and halted on the Stard. Side to view a verry bad\r\nplace, the Current divided by 2 Islands of rocks the lower of them\r\nlarge and in the middle of the river, this place being verry bad I Sent\r\nby land all the men who could not Swim and Such articles as was most\r\nvaluable to us Such as papers Guns & amunition, and proceeded down with\r\nthe Canoes two at a time to a village of 20 wood housies in a Deep bend\r\nto the Stard.

Fields & Peter Crusat proceeded down to examine the rapids the\r\nGreat Shute which commenced at the Island on which we encamped Continud\r\nwith great rapidity and force thro a narrow chanel much compressd. and\r\ninterspersed with large rocks for 1/2 a mile, at a mile lower is a\r\nverry Considerable rapid at which place the waves are remarkably high,\r\nand proceeded on in a old Indian parth 21/2 miles by land thro a thick\r\nwood & hill Side, to the river where the Indians make a portage, from\r\nthis place I dispatched Peter Crusat (our principal waterman) back to\r\nfollow the river and examine the practibility of the Canoes passing, as\r\nthe rapids appeared to continue down below as far as I could See, I\r\nwith Jo. Fields proceeded on, at 1/2 a mile below the end of the\r\nportage passed a house where there had been an old town for ages past\r\nas this house was old Decayed and a plat of flees I did not enter it,\r\nabout 1/2 a mile below this house in a verry thick part of the woods is\r\n8 vaults which appeared Closely Covered and highly deckerated with\r\norniments. Those vaults are all nearly the Same Sise and form 8 feet\r\nSquare, 5 feet high, Sloped a little So as to convey off the rain made\r\nof Pine or Cedar boards Closely Connected & Scurely Covered with wide\r\nboards, with a Dore left in The East Side which is partially Stoped\r\nwith wide boards curiously engraved. In Several of those vaults the\r\ndead bodies wre raped up verry Securely in Skins tied around with cords\r\nof grass & bark, laid on a mat, all east & west and Some of those\r\nvaults had as maney as 4 bodies laying on the Side of each other. the\r\nother Vaults Containing bones only, Some contained bones for the debth\r\nof 4 feet. on the tops and on poles attached to those vaults hung Brass\r\nkitties & frying pans pearced thro their bottoms, baskets, bowls of\r\nwood, Sea Shels, Skins, bits of Cloth, Hair, bags of Trinkets & Small\r\npeices of bone &c and independant of the curious ingraveing and\r\nPaintings on the boards which formed the vaults I observed Several\r\nwooden Images, cut in the figure of men and Set up on the Sides of the\r\nvaults all round. Some of those So old and worn by time, that they were\r\nnearly out of Shape, I also observed the remains of Vaults rotted\r\nentirely into the ground and covered with moss. This must bee the\r\nburrying place for maney ages for the inhabitants of those rapids, the\r\nvaults are of the most lasting timber Pine & Cedar--I cannot Say\r\ncertainly that those nativs worship those wooden idols as I have every\r\nreason to believe they do not; as they are Set up in the most\r\nconspicious parts of their houses, and treated more like orniments than\r\nobjects of aderation. at 2 miles lower & 5 below our Camp I passed a\r\nvillage of 4 large houses abandend by the nativs, with their Bores\r\nbared up, I looked into those houses and observed as much property as\r\nis usial in the houses of those people which induced me to conclude\r\nthat they wre at no great distance, either hunting or Colecting roots,\r\nto add to their winter Subsistance. from a Short distance below the\r\nvaults the mountain which is but low on the Stard.

I observed Several places on\r\nthis Island where the nativs had dug for roots and from its lower point\r\nI observed 5 Indians in a Canoe below the upper point of an Island near\r\nthe middle of the river Covered with tall timber, which indued me to\r\nbelieve that a village was at no great distanc below, I could not See\r\nany rapids below in the extent of my view which was for a long distance\r\ndown the river, which from the last rapids widened and had everry\r\nappearance of being effected by the tide,--I deturmind to return to\r\nCamp 10 miles distant, a remarkable high detached rock Stands in a\r\nbottom on the Stard Side near the lower point of this Island on the\r\nStard.

I believe mostly with the latter as their knowledge of the white\r\npeople appears to be verry imperfect, and the articles which they\r\nappear to trade mostly i e Pounded fish, Beargrass, and roots; cannot\r\nbe an object of comerce with furin merchants--however they git in\r\nreturn for those articles Blue and white beeds copper Tea Kitties,\r\nbrass arm bands, some Scarlet and blue robes and a fiew articles of old\r\nclothes, they prefer beeds to any thing and will part with the last\r\nmouthfull or articles of clothing they have for a fiew of those beeds,\r\nthose beeds the trafick with Indians Still higher up this river for\r\nroabs, Skins, cha-pel-el bread, beargrass &c. who in their turn trafick\r\nwith those under the rockey mountains for Beargrass, Pashico roots &\r\nrobes &c.\r\n\r\nThe nativs of the waters of the Columbia appear helthy, Some have\r\nturners on different parts of their bodies, and Sore and weak Eyes are\r\ncommon, maney have lost their Sight entirely great numbers with one eye\r\nout and frequently the other verry weak; This misfortune I must again\r\nasscribe to the water &c. They have bad teeth, which is not common with\r\nindians, maney have worn their teeth down and Some quite into their\r\ngums, this I cannot Satisfactorily account for it, do ascribe it in\r\nsome measure to their method of eateing, their food, roots pertiularly,\r\nwhich they make use of as they are taken out of the earth frequently\r\nnearly covered with Sand, I have not Seen any of their long roots\r\noffered for Sale clear of Sand. They are rether below the Common Size\r\nhigh cheeks womin Small and homely, and have Swelled legs and thighs,\r\nand their knees remarkably large which I ascribe to the method in which\r\nthey Sit on their hams-go nearly necked wareing only a piece of leather\r\ntied about their breast which falls down nearly as low as the waste, a\r\nSmall roabe about 3 feet Square, and a piece of leather tied about\r\ntheir breach, They have all flat heads in this quarter They are tirty\r\nin the extream, both in their person and cooking, ware their hare loose\r\nhanging in every direction.

These people the Chinnooks and others residing in this\r\nneighbourhood and speaking the same language have been very friendly to\r\nus; they appear to be a mild inoffensive people but will pilfer if they\r\nhave an opportuny to do so where they conceive themselves not liable to\r\ndetection. they are great higlers in trade and if they conceive you\r\nanxious to purchase will be a whole day bargaining for a handfull of\r\nroots; this I should have thought proceeded from their want of\r\nknowledge of the comparitive value of articles of merchandize and the\r\nfear of being cheated, did I not find that they invariably refuse the\r\nprice first offered them and afterwards very frequently accept a\r\nsmaller quantity of the same article; in order to satisfy myself on\r\nthis subject I once offered a Chinnook my watch two knives and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of beads for a small inferior sea Otter's skin\r\nwhich I did not much want, he immediately conceived it of great value,\r\nand refused to barter except I would double the quantity of beads; the\r\nnext day with a great deal of importunity on his part I received the\r\nskin in exchange for a few strans of the same beads he had refused the\r\nday before. I therefore believe this trait in their character proceeds\r\nfrom an avaricious all grasping disposition. in this rispect they\r\ndiffer from all Indians I ever became acquainted with, for their\r\ndispositions invariably lead them to give whatever they are possessed\r\noff no matter how usefull or valuable, for a bauble which pleases their\r\nfancy, without consulting it's usefullness or value. nothing\r\ninteresting occurred today, or more so, than our wappetoe being all\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 4, 1806]\r\nSaturday 4th January 1806\r\nComowool and the Clatsops who visited us yesterday left us in the\r\nmorning. Those people the Chinnook and others resideing in this\r\nneighbourhood and Speaking the Same language have been very friendly to\r\nus; they appear to be a mild inoffensive people but will pilfer if they\r\nhave an oppertunity to do So when they Conceive themselves not liable\r\nto detection. they are great higlers in trade and if they Conceive you\r\nanxious to purchase will be a whole day bargaining for a hand full of\r\nroots; this I Should have thought proceeded from their want of\r\nKnowledge of the Comparitive value of articles of merchindize and the\r\nfear of being Cheated, did I not find that they invariably refuse the\r\nprice first offered them and afterwards very frequently accept a\r\nSmaller quantity of the Same article; in order to Satisfy myself on\r\nthis point, I once offered a Clatsop man my watch a knife, a Dollar of\r\nthe Coin of U State and hand full of beeds, for a Small Sea otter Skin,\r\nwhich I did not much want, he immediately Conceived it of great value,\r\nand refused to Sell unless I would give as maney more beads; the next\r\nday with a great deel of importunity on his part we receved the Skin in\r\nexchange for a fiew Strans of the Same beeds he had refused the day\r\nbefore. I therefore beleive this treat in their Charector proceeds from\r\nan avericious all grasping dis-position. in this respect they differ\r\nfrom all Indians I ever became acquainted with, for their dispositions\r\ninvariably lead them to give what ever they are possessed off no matter\r\nhow usefull or valueable, for a bauble which pleases their fancy,\r\nwithout Consulting its usefullness or value. nothing occured to day, or\r\nmore So, than our wappato being all exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 5, 1806]\r\nSunday January 5th 1806.\r\nAt 5 P.M. Willard and Wiser returned, they had not been lost as we\r\napprehended. they informed us that it was not untill the fifth day\r\nafter leaving the Fort that they could find a convenient place for\r\nmaking salt; that they had at length established themselves on the\r\ncoast about 15 Miles S. W. from this, near the lodge of some Killamuck\r\nfamilies; that the Indians were very friendly and had given them a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the blubber of a whale which perished on the\r\ncoast some distance S. E. of them; part of this blubber they brought\r\nwith them, it was white & not unlike the fat of Poark, tho the texture\r\nwas more spongey and somewhat coarser. I had a part of it cooked and\r\nfound it very pallitable and tender, it resembled the beaver or the dog\r\nin flavour. it may appear somewhat extraordinary tho it is a fact that\r\nthe flesh of the beaver and dog possess a very great affinity in point\r\nof flavour. These lads also informed us that J. Fields, Bratton and\r\nGibson (the Salt makers) had with their assistance erected a\r\ncomfortable camp killed an Elk and several deer and secured a good\r\nstock of meat; they commenced the making of salt and found that they\r\ncould obtain from 3 quarts to a gallon a day; they brought with them a\r\nspecemine of the salt of about a gallon, we found it excellent, fine,\r\nstrong, & white; this was a great treat to myself and most of the\r\nparty, having not had any since the 20th ultmo.; I say most of the\r\nparty, for my friend Capt. Clark declares it to be a mear matter of\r\nindifference with him whether he uses it or not; for myself I must\r\nconfess I felt a considerable inconvenience from the want of it; the\r\nwant of bread I consider as trivial provided, I get fat meat, for as to\r\nthe species of meat I am not very particular, the flesh of the dog the\r\nhorse and the wolf, having from habit become equally formiliar with any\r\nother, and I have learned to think that if the chord be sufficiently\r\nstrong, which binds the soul and boddy together, it dose not so much\r\nmatter about the materials which compose it. Colter also returned this\r\nevening unsuccessfull from the chase, having been absent since the 1st\r\nInst.--Capt. Clark determined this evening to set out early tomorrow\r\nwith two canoes and 12 men in quest of the whale, or at all events to\r\npurchase from the Indians a parcel of the blubber, for this purpose he\r\nprepared a small assortment of merchandize to take with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 5, 1806]\r\nSunday 5th of January 1806\r\nAt 5 p.m.Willard and Wiser returned, they had not been lost as we\r\nexpected. they informd us that it was not untill the 5th day after\r\nleaveing the fort, that they Could find a Convenient place for makeing\r\nSalt; that they had at length established themselves on the Sea Coast\r\nabout 15 miles S. W. from this, near the houses of Some Clat Sop & Kil\r\na mox families; that the Indians were very friendly and had given them\r\na considerable quantity of the blubber of the whale which perished on\r\nthe Coast Some distance S. E. of them, it was white and not unlike the\r\nfat of Pork, tho the texture was more Spungey and Somewhat Coarser. we\r\nhad part of it Cooked and found it very pallitable and tender, it\r\nresembles the beaver in flavour. those men also informed us that the\r\nSalt makers with their assistance had erected a Comfortable Camp, had\r\nkilled an Elk and Several Deer and Secured a good Stock of Meat; they\r\nCommenced the makeing of Salt and found that they Could make from 3\r\nquarts to a gallon a day; they brought with them a Specimen of the\r\nSalt, of about a gallon, we found it excellent white & fine, but not So\r\nStrong as the rock Salt or that made in Kentucky or the Western parts\r\nof the U, States--this Salt was a great treat to most of the party,\r\nhaveing not had any Since the 20th ulto. as to my Self I care but\r\nlittle whether I have any with my meat or not; provided the meat fat,\r\nhaveing from habit become entirely cearless about my diat, and I have\r\nlearned to think that if the Cord be Sufficiently Strong which binds\r\nthe Soul and boddy together, it does not So much matter about the\r\nmaterials which Compose it.\r\n\r\nColter returned this evening unsecksessfull from the Chase, haveing\r\nbeen absent since the 1st inst.\r\n\r\nI determine to Set out early tomorrow with two canoes & 12 men in quest\r\nof the whale, or at all events to purchase from the indians a parcel of\r\nthe blubber, for this purpose I made up a Small assortment of\r\nmerchindize, and directed the men to hold themselves in readiness &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 6, 1806]\r\nMonday January 6th 1806.\r\nCapt Clark set out after an early breakfast with the party in two\r\ncanoes as had been concerted the last evening; Charbono and his Indian\r\nwoman were also of the party; the Indian woman was very impotunate to\r\nbe permited to go, and was therefore indulged; she observed that she\r\nhad traveled a long way with us to see the great waters, and that now\r\nthat monstrous fish was also to be seen, she thought it very hard she\r\ncould not be permitted to see either (she had never yet been to the\r\nOcean).\r\n\r\nThe Clatsops, Chinnooks, Killamucks &c. are very loquacious and\r\ninquisitive; they possess good memories and have repeated to us the\r\nnames capasities of the vessels &c of many traders and others who have\r\nvisited the mouth of this river; they are generally low in stature,\r\nproportionably small, reather lighter complected and much more illy\r\nformed than the Indians of the Missouri and those of our frontier; they\r\nare generally cheerfull but never gay. with us their conversation\r\ngenerally turns upon the subjects of trade, smoking, eating or their\r\nwomen; about the latter they speak without reserve in their presents,\r\nof their every part, and of the most formiliar connection. they do not\r\nhold the virtue of their women in high estimation, and will even\r\nprostitute their wives and daughters for a fishinghook or a stran of\r\nbeads. in common with other savage nations they make their women\r\nperform every species of domestic drudgery. but in almost every species\r\nof this drudgery the men also participate. their women are also\r\ncompelled to geather roots, and assist them in taking fish, which\r\narticles form much the greatest part of their subsistance;\r\nnotwithstanding the survile manner in which they treat their women they\r\npay much more rispect to their judgment and oppinions in many rispects\r\nthan most indian nations; their women are permitted to speak freely\r\nbefore them, and sometimes appear to command with a tone of authority;\r\nthey generally consult them in their traffic and act in conformity to\r\ntheir opinions. I think it may be established as a general maxim that\r\nthose nations treat their old people and women with most differrence\r\nand rispect where they subsist principally on such articles that these\r\ncan participate with the men in obtaining them; and that, that part of\r\nthe community are treated with.least attention, when the act of\r\nprocuring subsistence devolves intirely on the men in the vigor of\r\nlife. It appears to me that nature has been much more deficient in her\r\nfilial tie than in any other of the strong affections of the human\r\nheart, and therefore think, our old men equally with our women indebted\r\nto civilization for their ease and comfort. Among the Siouxs,\r\nAssinniboins and others on the Missouri who subsist by hunting it is a\r\ncustom when a person of either sex becomes so old and infurm that they\r\nare unable to travel on foot from camp to camp as they rome in surch of\r\nsubsistance, for the children or near relations of such person to leave\r\nthem without compunction or remose; on those occasions they usually\r\nplace within their reach a small peace of meat and a platter of water,\r\ntelling the poor old superannuated wretch for his consolation, that he\r\nor she had lived long enough, that it was time they should dye and go\r\nto their relations who can afford to take care of them much better than\r\nthey could. I am informed that this custom prevails even among the\r\nMinetares Arwerharmays and Recares when attended by their old people on\r\ntheir hunting excurtions; but in justice to these people I must observe\r\nthat it appeared to me at their vilages, that they provided tolerably\r\nwell for their aged persons, and several of their feasts appear to have\r\nprincipally for their object a contribution for their aged and infirm\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThis day I overhalled our merchandize and dryed it by the fire, found\r\nit all damp; we have not been able to keep anything dry for many days\r\ntogether since we arrived in this neighbourhood, the humidity of the\r\nair has been so excessively great. our merchandize is reduced to a mear\r\nhandfull, and our comfort during our return the next year much depends\r\non it, it is therefore almost unnecessary to add that we much regret\r\nthe reduced state of this fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 6, 1806]\r\n2 3 4 5 & all Day\r\n6t of January 1805 all last night rained without intermition, & the\r\nmorning. I sat out with 12 men in 2 Canoes to around thro the bay and\r\nup a Creek to an old landing at which place the Indians have a roade\r\nacross thro Shashes West I landed made the Canoes fast and Set out up\r\nthe Cree on a road passed thro 3 Stashes to a pond, then up & around th\r\nbend along a bad thick way, took an Indian path which took us to a\r\nCreek which runs into the Sand bay at which place we found a Canoe\r\nwhich took over 3 men at a time crossed and on the top of a rise Saw\r\nElk prosued & Killed one and encamped at the forks of a Creek the West\r\nEate th Elk all up. a fine Butifull moon Shining night unto _____, Swan\r\nGeese, Brand &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 6, 1806]\r\nMonday 6th of January 1806\r\nThe last evening Shabono and his Indian woman was very impatient to be\r\npermitted to go with me, and was therefore indulged; She observed that\r\nShe had traveled a long way with us to See the great waters, and that\r\nnow that monstrous fish was also to be Seen, She thought it verry hard\r\nthat She Could not be permitted to See either (She had never yet been\r\nto the Ocian). after an early brackfast I Set out with two Canoes down\r\nthe Ne tel R into Meriwether Bay with a view to proced on to the\r\nClatsop town, and hire a guide to conduct me through the Creeks which I\r\nhad every reason to beleeve Comunicated both with the Bay and a Small\r\nriver near to which our men were making Salt. Soon after I arrived in\r\nthe Bay the wind Sprung up from the N. W and blew So hard and raised\r\nthe waves so high that we were obliged to put into a Small Creek Short\r\nof the Village. finding I could not proceed on to the Village in Safty,\r\nI deturmined to assend this Creek as high as the Canoes would go; which\r\nfrom its directions must be near the open lands in which I had been on\r\nthe 10th ulto., and leave the Canoes and proceed on by land. at the\r\ndistance of about 3 miles up this Creek I observed Some high open land,\r\nat which place a road Set out and had every appearance of a portage,\r\nhere I landed drew up the Canoes and Set out by land, proceeded on\r\nthrough 3 deep Slashes to a pond about a mile in length and 200 yards\r\nwide, kept up this pond leaving it to the right, and passing the head\r\nto a Creek which we Could not Cross, this Creek is the one which I\r\nrafted on the 8th & 9 ultimo. and at no great distance from where I\r\ncrossed in Cus ca lars Canoe on the 10th ulto. to which place I\r\nexpected a find a canoe, we proceeded on and found a Small Canoe at the\r\nplace I expected, calculated to Carry 3 men, we crossed and from the\r\ntop of a ridge in the Prarie we Saw a large gange of Elk feeding about\r\n2 miles below on our direction. I divided the party So as to be Certain\r\nof an elk, Several Shot were fired only one Elk fell, I had this Elk\r\nbutchered and carried to a Creak in advance at which place I intended\r\nto encamp, two other Elk were badly Shot, but as it was nearly dark we\r\nCould not pursue them, we proceeded on to the forks of the Creek which\r\nwe had just Crossed turning around to the S W. and meeting one of equal\r\nSize from the South, the two makeing a little river 70 yards wide which\r\nfalls into the Ocian near the 3 Clat Sop houses which I visited on the\r\n9th ulto. in the forks of this Creek we found Some drift pine which had\r\nbeen left on the Shore by the tide of which we made fires. the evening\r\na butifull Clear moon Shiney night, and the 1st fair night which we\r\nhave had for 2 months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 7, 1806]\r\nMonday January 7th 1806.\r\nLast evening Drewyer visited his traps and caught a beaver and an\r\notter; the beaver was large and fat we have therefore fared sumptuously\r\ntoday; this we consider a great prize for another reason, it being a\r\nfull grown beaver was well supplyed with the materials for making bate\r\nwith which to catch others. this bate when properly prepared will\r\nintice the beaver to visit it as far as he can smell it, and this I\r\nthink may be safely stated at a mile, their sense of smelling being\r\nvery accute. To prepare beaver bate, the castor or bark stone is taken\r\nas the base, this is gently pressed out of the bladderlike bag which\r\ncontains it, into a phiol of 4 ounces with a wide mouth; if you have\r\nthem you will put from four to six stone in a phiol of that capacity,\r\nto this you will add half a nutmeg, a douzen or 15 grains of cloves and\r\nthirty grains of cinimon finely pulverized, stir them well together and\r\nthen add as much ardent sperits to the composition as will reduce it\r\nthe consistency mustard prepared for the table; when thus prepared it\r\nresembles mustard precisely to all appearance. when you cannot procure\r\na phiol a bottle made of horn or a tight earthen vessel will answer, in\r\nall cases it must be excluded from the air or it will soon loose it's\r\nvirtue; it is fit for uce immediately it is prepared but becomes much\r\nstronger and better in about four or five days and will keep for months\r\nprovided it be perfectly secluded from the air. when cloves are not to\r\nbe had use double the quantity of Allspice, and when no spice can be\r\nobtained use the bark of the root of sausafras; when sperits cannot be\r\nhad use oil stone of the beaver adding mearly a sufficient quantity to\r\nmoisten the other materials, or reduce it to a stif past. it appears to\r\nme that the principal uce of the spices is only to give a variety to\r\nthe scent of the bark stone and if so the mace vineller and other\r\nsweetsmelling spices might be employed with equal advantage. The male\r\nbeaver has six stones, two which contain a substance much like finely\r\npulvarized bark of a pale yellow colour and not unlike tanner's ooz in\r\nsmell, these are called the bark stones or castors; two others, which\r\nlike the bark stone resemble small bladders, contain a pure oil of a\r\nstrong rank disagreeable smell, and not unlike train oil, these are\r\ncalled the oil stones; and 2 others of generation. the Barkstones are\r\nabout two inches in length, the others somewhat smaller all are of a\r\nlong oval form; and lye in a bunch together between the skin and the\r\nroot of the tail, beneath or behind the fundament with which they are\r\nclosely connected and seem to communicate. the pride of the female lyes\r\non the inner side much like those of the hog. they have no further\r\nparts of generation that I can perceive and therefore beleive that like\r\nthe birds they copulate with the extremity of the gut. The female have\r\nfrom two to four young ones at a birth and bring fourth once a year\r\nonly, which usually happens about the latter end of may and begining of\r\nJune. at this stage she is said to drive the male from the lodge, who\r\nwould otherwise destroy the young.--dryed our lodge and had it put away\r\nunder shelter; this is the first day during which we have had no rain\r\nsince we arrived at this place. nothing extraordinary happened today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 7, 1806]\r\nJany 7th Tuesday 1806\r\nSet out at Day light, porceded up the Creek about 2 mile and crossed on\r\na tree trunk the Salt makers have fallen across, then proceeded on to\r\nthe Ocean 3/4 mile & proceded up 3 miles to the mouth of Colimex River\r\nabout 80 or 100 yds wide verry rapid & Cuts its banks, here we found an\r\nold Village of 3 houses, one only inhabited by one familey, I gave the\r\nman a fish hook to put the party across, on the bank found a Skeet fish\r\nwhich had been lef by the tide proceded on 2 miles on the bank opposit\r\na kind of bay the river Cross to the Sea Cost to 2 Inds Indians Lodges\r\nat which place I found our Salt makers near the foot of a mountain\r\nwhich form the Shore.

It may appear Somewhat incrediable, but So it\r\nis that the Elk which was killed last evening was eaten except about 8\r\npounds, which I directed to be taken along with the Skin, I proceded up\r\nthe South fork of the Creek about 2 miles and crossed on a pine tree\r\nwhich had been fallen by the Saltmakers on their first going out, on\r\nthis tree we crossed the deepest of the water and waded on the opposit\r\nSide for 30 yards, from thence to the ocian 3/4 of a mile through a\r\nContinuation of open ridgey Prarie, here the Coast is Sandy, we\r\nproceeded on the Sandy beech nearly South for 3 miles to the mouth of\r\nbutifull river with bold and rapid Current of 85 yards wide and 3 feet\r\ndeep in the Shallowest place, a Short distance up this river on the N E\r\nSide is the remains of an old village of Clatsops. I entered a house\r\nwhere I found a Man 2 Womn & 3 Children, they appeared retchedly pore &\r\ndirty, I hired the man to Set us across the River which I call after\r\nthe Nation Clat Sop river for which I gave 2 fishing hooks--at this\r\nplace the Creek over which I crossed on a tree passes within 100 yards\r\nof the Clat Sop river over which the nativs have a portage which\r\naffords them an easy Communication with the villages near point adams,\r\nand at the mouth of the Creek, on which we lay last night. in walking\r\non the Sand after crossing the river I Saw a Singular Species of fish\r\nwhich I had never before Seen one of the men Call this fish a Skaite,\r\nit is properly a Thornback. I proceeded on about 2 miles to near the\r\nbase of high Mountain where I found our Salt makers, and with them\r\nSergt. Gass, Geo. Shannon was out in the woods assisting Jo Field and\r\ngibson to kill Some meat, the Salt makers had made a neet Close Camp,\r\nConvenient to wood Salt water and the fresh water of the Clat Sop river\r\nwhich at this place was within 100 paces of the Ocian they wer also\r\nSituated near 4 houses of Clatsops & Killamox, who they informed me had\r\nbeen verry kind and attentive to them. I hired a young Indian to pilot\r\nme to the whale for which Service I gave him a file in hand and\r\npromised Several other Small articles on my return, left Sergt. Gass\r\nand one man of my party Werner to make Salt & permited Bratten to\r\naccompany me, we proceeded on the round Slipery Stones under a high\r\nhill which projected into the ocian about 4 miles further than the\r\ndirection of the Coast. after walking for 21/2 miles on the Stones my\r\nguide made a Sudin halt, pointed to the top of the mountain and uttered\r\nthe word Pe Shack which means bad, and made Signs that we could not\r\nproceed any further on the rocks, but must pass over that mountain, I\r\nhesitated a moment & view this emence mountain the top of which was\r\nobscured in the clouds, and the assent appeard. to be almost\r\nperpindecular; as the Small Indian parth allong which they had brought\r\nemence loads but a fiew hours before, led up this mountain and appeared\r\nto assend in a Sideling direction, I thought more than probable that\r\nthe assent might be torerably easy and therefore proceeded on, I soon\r\nfound that the ____ become much worst as I assended, and at one place\r\nwe were obliged to Support and draw our Selves up by the bushes & roots\r\nfor near 100 feet, and after about 2 hours labour and fatigue we\r\nreached the top of this high mountain, from the top of which I looked\r\ndown with estonishment to behold the hight which we had assended, which\r\nappeared to be 10 or 12 hundred feet up a mountain which appeared to be\r\nalmost perpindicular, here we met 14 Indians men and women loaded with\r\nthe oil & Blubber of the whale. In the face of this tremendeous\r\nprecipic imediately below us, there is a Strater of white earth (which\r\nmy guide informed me) the neighbouring indians use to paint themselves,\r\nand which appears to me to resemble the earth of which the French\r\nPorcelain is made; I am confident that this earth Contains argill, but\r\nwhether it also Contains Silex or magnesia, or either of those earths\r\nin a proper perpotion I am unable to deturmine. we left the top of the\r\nprecipice and proceeded on a bad road and encamped on a Small run passin\r\ng to the left. all much fatiagued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 8, 1806]\r\nTuesday January 8th 1806.\r\nOur meat is begining to become scarse; sent Drewyer and Collins to hunt\r\nthis morning. the guard duty being hard on the men who now remain in\r\nthe fort I have for their relief since the departure of Capt.

In\r\nconsequence of the clouds this evening I lost my P.M. observation for\r\nEqual Altitudes, and from the same cause have not been able to take a\r\nsingle observation since we have been at this place. nothing\r\nextraordinary happened today.\r\n\r\nThe Clatsops Chinnooks and others inhabiting the coast and country in\r\nthis neighbourhood, are excessively fond of smoking tobacco. in the act\r\nof smoking they appear to swallow it as they dran it from the pipe, and\r\nfor many draughts together you will not perceive the smoke which they\r\ntake from the pipe; in the same manner also they inhale it in their\r\nlungs untill they become surcharged with this vapour when they puff it\r\nout to a great distance through their nostils and mouth; I have no\r\ndoubt the smoke of the tobacco in this manner becomes much more\r\nintoxicating and that they do possess themselves of all it's virtues in\r\ntheir fullest extent; they freequently give us sounding proofs of it's\r\ncreating a dismorallity of order in the abdomen, nor are those light\r\nmatters thought indelicate in either sex, but all take the liberty of\r\nobeying the dictates of nature without reserve. these people do not\r\nappear to know the uce of sperituous liquors, they never having once\r\nasked us for it; I presume therefore that the traders who visit them\r\nhave never indulged them with the uce of it; from what ever cause this\r\nmay proceede, it is a very fortunate occurrence, as well for the\r\nnatives themselves, as for the quiet and safety of thos whites who\r\nvisit them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 8, 1806]\r\nJany 8 Wedned\r\nSet out at Day a fine morning wind hard from S.

E. the\r\ncoast as as far as my sight Could be extended, the Seas rageing with\r\nemence wave and brakeing with great force from the rocks of Cape\r\nDisapointment as far as I could See to the N. W. The Clatsops Chinnooks\r\nand other villagers on each Side of the Columbia river and in the\r\nPraries below me, the meanderings of 3 handsom Streams heading in Small\r\nlakes at the foot the high Country; The Columbia River for a Some\r\ndistance up, with its Bays and Small rivers and on the other Side I\r\nhave a view of the Coast for an emence distance to the S.

Near this old\r\nTown I observed large Canoes of the neetest kind on the ground Some of\r\nwhich appeared nearly decayed others quit Sound, I examoned those\r\nCanoes and found they were the repository of the dead--This Custom of\r\nSecureing the Dead differs a little from the Chinnooks. the Kil a mox\r\nSecure the dead bodies in an oblong box of Plank, which is placed in an\r\nopen Canoe resting on the ground, in which is put a paddle and Sundery\r\nother articles the property of the disceased. The Coast in the\r\nneighbourhood of this old village is slipping from the Sides of the\r\nhigh hills, in emence masses; fifty or a hundred acres at a time give\r\nway and a great proportion of an instant precipitated into the Ocean.\r\nthose hills and mountains are principally composed of a yellow Clay;\r\ntheir Slipping off or Spliting assunder at this time is no doubt Caused\r\nby the incessant rains which has fallen within the last two months. the\r\nmountans Covered with a verry heavy Croth of pine & furr, also the\r\nwhite Cedar or arbor vita and a Small proportion of the black alder,\r\nthis alder grows to the hight of Sixty or Seventy feet and from 2 to 3\r\nfeet in diamiter. Some Species of pine on the top of the Point of View\r\nrise to the emmence hight of 210 feet and from 8 to 12 feet in\r\ndiameter, and are perfectly Sound and Solid. Wind hard from the S.

I returned to the village of 5 Cabins on\r\nthe Creek which I shall call E co-la or whale Creek, found the nativs\r\nbusily engaged boiling the blubber, which they performed in a large\r\nSquar wooden trought by means of hot Stones; the oil when extracted was\r\nSecured in bladders and the Guts of the whale; the blubber from which\r\nthe oil was only partially extracted by this process, was laid by in\r\ntheir Cabins in large flickes for use; those flickes they usially\r\nexpose to the fire on a wooden Spit untill it is prutty well wormed\r\nthrough and then eate it either alone or with roots of the rush, Shaw\r\nna tdk we or diped in the oil. The Kil a mox although they possessed\r\nlarge quantities of this blubber and oil were so prenurious that they\r\ndisposed of it with great reluctiance and in Small quantities only;\r\ninsomuch that my utmost exertion aided by the party with the Small\r\nStock of merchindize I had taken with me were not able to precure more\r\nblubber than about 300 wt. and a fiew gallons of oil; Small as this\r\nStock is I prise it highly; and thank providence for directing the\r\nwhale to us; and think him much more kind to us than he was to jonah,\r\nhaving Sent this monster to be Swallowed by us in Sted of Swallowing of\r\nus as jonah's did. I recrossed E co la Creek and Encamped on the bank\r\nat which place we observed an ebundance of fine wood the Indian men\r\nfollowed me for the purpose of Smokeing. I enquired of those people as\r\nwell as I could by Signs the Situation, mode of liveing & Strength of\r\ntheir nation They informed me that the bulk of their nation lived in 3\r\nlarge villages Still further along the Sea coast to the S, S, W. at the\r\nenterence Of 3 Creek which fell into a bay, and that other houses were\r\nScattered about on the Coast, Bay and on a Small river which fell into\r\nthe Bay in which they Cought Salmon, and from this Creek (which I call\r\nKil a mox River) they crossed over to the Wappato I. on the\r\nShock-ah-lil com (which is the Indian name for the Columbia river) and\r\npurchased Wappato &c. that the nation was once verry large and that\r\nthey had a great maney houses, In Salmon Season they Cought great\r\nnumbers of that fish in the Small Creeks, when the Salmon was Scerce\r\nthey found Sturgion and a variety of other fish thrown up by the waves\r\nand left by the tide which was verry fine, Elk was plenty in the\r\nmountains, but they Could not Kill maney of them with their arrows. The\r\nKil d mox in their habits Customs manners dress & language differ but\r\nlittle from the Clatsops, Chinnooks and others in this neighbourhood\r\nare of the Same form of those of the Clatsops with a Dore at each end &\r\ntwo fire places i, e the house is double as long as wide and divided\r\ninto 2 equal parts with a post in the middle Supporting the ridge pole,\r\nand in the middle of each of those divisions they make their fires,\r\ndotes Small & houses Sunk 5 feet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 9, 1806]\r\nFriday January 9th 1806.\r\nOur men are now very much engaged in dressing Elk and Deer skins for\r\nmockersons and cloathing. the deer are extreemly scarce in this\r\nneighbourhood, some are to be found near the praries and open grounds\r\nalong the coast. this evening we heard seven guns in quick succession\r\nafter each other, they appeared to be on the Creek to the South of us\r\nand several miles distant; I expect that the hunters Drewyer and\r\nCollins have fallen in with a gang of Elk. some marrow bones and a\r\nlittle fresh meat would be exceptable; I have been living for two days\r\npast on poor dryed Elk, or jurk as the hunters term it.\r\n\r\nThe Clatsops Chinnooks &c. bury their dead in their canoes. for this\r\npurpose four pieces of split timber are set erect on end, and sunk a\r\nfew feet in the grown, each brace having their flat sides opposite to\r\neach other and sufficiently far assunder to admit the width of the\r\ncanoes in which the dead are to be deposited; through each of these\r\nperpendicular posts, at the hight of six feet a mortice is cut, through\r\nwhich two bars of wood are incerted; on these cross bars a small canoe\r\nis placed in which the body is laid after being carefully roled in a\r\nrobe of some dressed skins; a paddle is also deposited with them; a\r\nlarger canoe is now reversed, overlaying and imbracing the small one,\r\nand resting with it's gunwals on the cross bars; one or more large mats\r\nof rushes or flags are then roled around the canoes and the whole\r\nsecurely lashed with a long cord, usually made of the bark of the Arbor\r\nvita or white cedar. on the cross bars which support the canoes is\r\nfrequently hung or laid various articles of cloathing culinary\r\neutensels &c. I cannot understand them sufficiently to make any\r\nenquiries relitive to their religeous opinions, but presume from their\r\ndepositing various articles with their dead, that they believe in a\r\nstate of future existence.\r\n\r\nThe persons who usually visit the entrance of this river for the\r\npurpose of traffic or hunting I believe are either English or\r\nAmericans; the Indians inform us that they speak the same language with\r\nourselves, and give us proofs of their varacity by repeating many words\r\nof English, as musquit, powder, shot, nife, file, damned rascal, sun of\r\na bitch &c. whether these traders are from Nootka sound, from some\r\nother late establishment on this coast, or immediately from the U\r\nStates or Great Brittain, I am at a loss to determine, nor can the\r\nIndians inform us. the Indians whom I have asked in what direction the\r\ntraders go when they depart from hence, or arrive here, always point to\r\nthe S. W. from which it is presumeable that Nootka cannot be their\r\ndestination; and as from Indian information a majority of these traders\r\nannually visit them about the beginning of April and remain with them\r\nsix or seven Months, they cannot come immediately from Great Britain or\r\nthe U States, the distance being too great for them to go and return in\r\nthe ballance of the year. from this circumstance I am sometimes induced\r\nto believe that there is some other establishment on the coast of\r\nAmerica south West of this place of which little is but yet known to\r\nthe world, or it may be perhaps on some Island in the pacific ocean\r\nbetween the Continents of Asia and America to the South West of us.\r\nThis traffic on the part of the whites consists in vending, guns,\r\n(principally old british or American musquits) powder, balls and Shot,\r\nCopper and brass kettles, brass teakettles and coffee pots, blankets\r\nfrom two to three point, scarlet and blue Cloth (coarse), plates and\r\nstrips of sheet copper and brass, large brass wire, knives, beads and\r\ntobacco with fishinghooks buttons and some other small articles; also a\r\nconsiderable quantity of Sailor's cloaths, as hats coats, trowsers and\r\nshirts. for these they receive in return from the natives, dressed and\r\nundressed Elkskins, skins of the sea Otter, common Otter, beaver,\r\ncommon fox, spuck, and tiger cat; also dryed and pounded sammon in\r\nbaskets, and a kind of buisquit, which the natives make of roots called\r\nby them shappelell. The natives are extravegantly fond of the most\r\ncommon cheap blue and white beads, of moderate size, or such that from\r\n50 to 70 will weigh one penneyweight. the blue is usually pefered to\r\nthe white; these beads constitute the principal circulating medium with\r\nall the indian tribes on this river; for these beads they will dispose\r\nany article they possess.--the beads are strung on strans of a fathom\r\nin length and in that manner sold by the bredth or yard.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 9, 1806]\r\nJanuary 9th Thursday 1806\r\na fine morning wind N E Set out at day lighte every man Some meat of\r\nthe whale and a little oile proceded on the track we Came out to a\r\nhouse at a branch where we halted 1/2 an hour to rest this house is at\r\nat place an old village has formerly been, on the Coast at the\r\nComencment ____ 27 foot wide 35 feet long Sunk in the ground 5 feet 2\r\nDotes & 2 fire places dotes 29 Ins. high & 141/4 wide handsom Steps to\r\ndecend down a post in the middle Coverede with boards Split thin an 2\r\nfeet wide, old grave in Canoes of 3 feet 8 Inches wide & 5 feet long\r\nneetly made high at bow proceded on to the top of the hill Passing 3\r\nbad points rockey &. from the Point Clarks Point of view Cape Disapt.\r\nbears S. 12° E passing a Great point at 15 miles one at 40 miles rocks\r\nout to the 1st large point from the Creek 4 points, between the 1st\r\nlarge Point and 2d a point of many large rocks, Day Clouded up, I can\r\nSee a point Bearing N 5° East along way just in Sight. from Clarks View\r\nPoint to Cape Disapointment is N 20° W.

I had the blubber & oil divided\r\namong the party and Set out about Sunrise and returned by the Same rout\r\nwe had went out, met Several parties of men & womin of the Chinnook and\r\nClatsops nations, on their way to trade with the Kil a mox for blubber\r\nand oil; on the Steep decent of the Mountain I overtook five men and\r\nSix womin with emence loads of the Oil and blubber of the Whale, those\r\nIndians had passed by Some rout by which we missed them as we went out\r\nyesterday; one of the women in the act of getting down a Steep part of\r\nthe mountain her load by Some means had Sliped off her back, and She\r\nwas holding the load by a Strap which was fastened to the mat bag in\r\nwhich it was in, in one hand and holding a bush by the other, as I was\r\nin front of my party, I endeavored to relieve this woman by takeing her\r\nload untill She Could get to a better place a little below, & to my\r\nestonishment found the load as much as I Could lift and must exceed 100\r\nwt. the husband of this woman who was below Soon came to her releif,\r\nthose people proceeded on with us to the Salt works, at which place we\r\narrived late in the evening, found them without meat, and 3 of the\r\nParty J. Field Gibson & Shannon out hunting. as I was excessively\r\nfatigued and my party appeared verry much so, I deturmined to Stay\r\nuntill the morning and rest our Selves a little. The Clatsops proceeded\r\non with their lodes--The Clatsops, Chin nooks Kil a mox &c. are verry\r\nloquacious and inquisitive; they possess good memories and have\r\nrepeeted to us the names capasities of the Vessels &c of maney traders\r\nand others who have visited the mouth of this river; they are generally\r\nlow in Statue, proportionably Small, reather lighter complected and\r\nmuch more illy formed than the Indians of the Missouri and those of our\r\nfronteers; they are generally Chearfull but never gay. with us their\r\nConversation generally turns upon the subject of trade, Smokeing,\r\neating or their womin; about the latter, they Speak without reserve in\r\ntheir presence, of their every part, and of the most farmiliar\r\nConnection. they do not hold the virtue of their womin in high\r\nestimation, and will even prostitute their wives and Daughters for a\r\nfishing hook or a Stran of beeds. in Common with other Savage nations\r\nthey make their womin perform every Species of domestic drugery; but in\r\nalmost every Species of this drugery the men also participate. their\r\nwoman are compelled to gather roots, and assist them in takeing fish;\r\nwhich articles form much the greater part of their Subsistance;\r\nnotwithstanding the Survile manner in which they treat their womin they\r\npay much more respect to their judgement and oppinion in maney respects\r\nthan most indian nations; their womin are permited to Speak freely\r\nbefore them, and Sometimes appear to command with a tone of authority;\r\nthey generally consult them in their traffic and act conformably to\r\ntheir opinions.\r\n\r\nI think it may be established as a general maxim that those nations\r\ntreat their old people and women with most defference and respect where\r\nthey Subsist principally on Such articles that these can participate\r\nwith the men in obtaining them; and that, that part of the Community\r\nare treated with least attention, when the act of precureing\r\nsubsistance devolves intirely on the men in the vigor of life. It\r\nappears to me that nature has been much more deficient in her filial\r\nties than in any others of the Strong effections of the humane heart,\r\nand therefore think our old men equally with our woman indebted to\r\nSivilization for their ease and Comfort. I am told among the Sioux's,\r\nAssinniboins and others on the Missouri who Subsist by hunting it is a\r\nCustom when a person of either Sex becoms So old and infirm that they\r\nare unable to travel on foot, from Camp to Camp as they rove in serch\r\nof Subsistance, for the Children or near relations of Such person to\r\nleave them without Compunction or remorse; on those occasions they\r\nusially place within their reach a Small piece of meat and a platter of\r\nwater, telling the poor old Superannuated retch for their Consolation,\r\nthat he or She had lived long enough, and that it was time they Should\r\ndie and go to their relations who Can afford to take Care of them, much\r\nbetter than they Could. I am informed that the Me ne tar es Ar war har\r\nmays and Ricares when attended by their old people on their hunting\r\nexpedition prosued the Same Custom; but injustice to those people I\r\nmust observe that it appeared to me at their villages, that they\r\nprovided tolerably well for their aged persons, and Several of their\r\nfeasts appear to have principally for their object a contribution for\r\ntheir aged and infirm persons. In one of the Mandan villages I Saw an\r\nold man to whome I gave a knife and enquired his age, he Said he had\r\nSeen more than 100 winters, and that he Should Soon go down the river\r\nto their old village--he requested I would give him Something to\r\nprevent the pain in his back his grand Son a Young man rebuked the old\r\nman and Said it was not worth while, that it was time for the old man\r\nto die. the old man occupied one Side of the fire and was furnished\r\nwith plenty of Covouring and food, and every attention appeared to be\r\npaid him &c. Jo. Field in my absence had killed an Elk and a Deer,\r\nbrought in the Deer and half of the Elk on a part of which we Suped,\r\nSome rain a little after dark. I visited a house near the Salt boilers\r\nfound it inhabited by 2 families, they were pore dirty and their house\r\nSworming with flees.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 10, 1806]\r\nSaturday January 10th 1806.\r\nAbout 10 A.M.

I gave him a medal of the smallest\r\nsize; he presented me with some indian tobacco and a basquit of\r\nwappetoe, in return for which I gave him some thread for making a\r\nskiming net and a small piece of tobacco. these people speak the same\r\nlanguage with the Chinnooks and Catsops whom they also resemble in\r\ntheir dress customs manners &c. they brought some dryed salmon,\r\nwappetoe, dogs, and mats made of rushes and flags, to barter; their\r\ndogs and a part of their wappetoe they disposed off, an remained all\r\nnight near the fort. This morning Drewyer and Collins returned having\r\nkilled two Elk only, and one of those had died in their view over a\r\nsmall lake which they had not the means of passing it being late in the\r\nevening and has of course spoiled, as it laid with the entrals in it\r\nall night; as the tide was going out we could not send for the elk\r\ntoday, therefore ordered a party to go for it early in the morning and\r\nGeorge and Collins to continue their hunt; meat has now become scarce\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nCapt Clark returned at to P.M. this evening with the majority of the\r\nparty who accompanyed him; having left some men to assist the\r\nsaltmakers to bring in the meat of two Elk which they had killed, and\r\nsent 2 others through by land to hunt. Capt. Clark found the whale on\r\nthe Coast about 45 Miles S. E. of Point Adams, and about 35 Miles from\r\nFort Clatsop by the rout he took; The whale was already pillaged of\r\nevery valuable part by the Killamucks, in the vicinity of one of whose\r\nvillages it lay on the strand where the waves and tide had driven up\r\nand left it. this skelleton measured one hundred and five feet. Capt.\r\nC. found the natives busily engaged in boiling the blubber, which they\r\nperformed in a large wooden trought by means of hot stones; the oil\r\nwhen extracted was secured in bladders and the guts of the whale; the\r\nblubber, from which the oil was only partially extracted by this\r\nprocess, was laid by in their lodges in large fliches for uce; this\r\nthey usually expose to the fire on a wooden spit untill it is pretty\r\nwell warmed through and then eat it either alone or with the roots of\r\nthe rush, squawmash, fern wappetoe &c. The natives although they\r\npossessed large quantities of this blubber and oil were so penurious\r\nthat they disposed of it with great reluctance and in small quantities\r\nonly; insomuch that the utmost exertions of Capt. C. and the whole\r\nparty aided by the little stock of merchandize he had taken with him\r\nand some small articles which the men had, were not able to procure\r\nmore blubber than about 300 lb. and a few gallons of the oil; this they\r\nhave brought with them, and small as the store is, we prize it highly,\r\nand thank providence for directing the whale to us, and think him much\r\nmore kind to us than he was jonah, having sent this monster to be\r\nswallowed by us in stead of swallowing of us as jona's did. Capt. C.\r\nfound the road along the coast extreemly difficult of axcess, lying\r\nover some high rough and stoney hills, one of which he discribes as\r\nbeing much higher than the others, having it's base washed by the Ocean\r\nover which it rares it's towering summit perpendicularly to the hight\r\nof 1500 feet; from this summit Capt. C. informed me that there was a\r\ndelightfull and most extensive view of the Ocean, the coast and\r\nadjacent country; this Mout. I have taken the liberty of naming Clark's\r\nMountain and point of view; it is situated about 30 M. S. E. of Point\r\nAdams and projects about 21/2 miles into the Ocean; Killamucks river\r\nfalls in a little to the N. W. of this mountain; in the face of this\r\ntremendious precepice there is a stra of white earth (see specimen No.\r\n____) which the neighbouring Indians use to paint themselves, and which\r\nappears to me to resemble the earth of which the French Porcelain is\r\nmade; I am confident this earth contains Argill, but wether it also\r\ncontains Silex or magnesia, or either of those earths in a proper\r\nproportion I am unable to determine.--Shannon and Gass were found with\r\nthe Salt makers and ordered to return McNeal was near being\r\nassassinated by a Killamuck Indian, but fortunately escaped in\r\nconsequence of a Chinnook woman giving information to Capt. C., the\r\nparty and Indians with them before the villain had prepaired himself to\r\nexecute his purposes. The party returned excessively fortiegued and\r\ntired of their jaunt. Killamucks river is 85 yards wide, rappid and 3\r\nfeet deep in the shallowest part. The Killamucks in their habits\r\ncustoms manners dress and language differ but little from the Clatsops\r\n& Chinnooks. they place their dead in canoes resting on the ground\r\nuncovered, having previously secured the dead bodies in an oblong box\r\nof plank.\r\n\r\nThe coast in the neighbourhood of Clarks Mountain is sliping off &\r\nfalling into the Ocean in immence masses; fifty or a hundred Acres at a\r\ntime give way and a great proportion in an instant precipitated into\r\nthe Ocean. these hills and mountains are principally composed of a\r\nyellow clay; there sliping off or spliting assunder at this time is no\r\ndoubt caused by the incessant rains which have fallen within the last\r\ntwo months. the country in general as about Fort Clatsop is covered\r\nwith a very heavy growth of several species of pine & furr, also the\r\narbor vita or white cedar and a small proportion of the black Alder\r\nwhich last sometimes grows to the hight of sixty or seventy feet, and\r\nfrom two to four feet in diameter. some species of the pine rise to the\r\nimmence hight of 210 feet and are from 7 to 12 feet in diameter, and\r\nare perfectly sound and solid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 10, 1806]\r\nJany 10 Friday 1806\r\nI left Sergt. Gass here and Set out at Sun rise, Crossed the little\r\nriver which I waded 85 yards wide & 3 feet Deep Swift, at which place I\r\nSaw Several Indians one of which had 2 butifull Sea orter Skins on as a\r\nroabe, here the Creek which I crossed at a tree and on which I camped\r\nthe 6th inst. came within 200 yds of the river & they Inds. make a\r\nportage here, Continued on a place 3 miles Crossed this Creek in a\r\nSmall Canoe. here I expected to find Shannon and gibson with meet to\r\nfurnish the Salt makers, but did not, divided the party Sent 2 men to\r\nmy right to try and kill Elk, Soon after met Gibson & Shannon with\r\nmeat, they had killed 2 Elk 2 miles to my right, I divided the meat\r\nbetween the party, and the load of 3 men whome I Send with gibson &\r\nShannon to help Carrey the 2 Elk to the Salt makers, and I my Self and\r\nthe party returned by the Same rout we went out to the Canoes Rd.\r\nFrasure behaved very badly, and mutonous--he also lost his large Knife.\r\nI Sent him back to look for his knife, with Directions to return with\r\nthe party of Serjt Gass, I proceded on, here is a portage of 1/4 of a\r\nmile from this Creck to a branch which falls into the Bay, we proceeded\r\non a much bette road than we went out across a Deep Slash and found our\r\nCanoes Safe, and Set out at Sunset, and arived at the foart, wet and\r\nCold at 9 oClock P.M. found a Cheif & number of Indians both Encamped\r\non the Shore, and at the fort of the Cath la-hur Tribe which lives at\r\nno great distance above this back of an Island Close under the South\r\nSide of the Columbia River\r\n\r\nThose people Speake the Same Language of the Clotsops dress nearly\r\nalike the men of both Cut their hair in the neck. use blankets of the\r\nmanifactory of the nativs near the falls of the Sheep Wool-fond of\r\nbrass arm bands and Check, They bring Wap-pa-to root (which is\r\nSagittifolia or the Common arrow head which is Cultivated by the\r\nChinees) to Sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 10, 1806]\r\nFriday the 10th of January 1806\r\nI derected Serjt. Gass to Continue with the Salt makers untill Shannon\r\nreturn from hunting, and then himself and Shannon to return to the\r\nFort, I Set out at Sunrise with the party waded the Clat Sop river\r\nwhich I found to be 85 Steps across and 3 feet deep, on the opposite\r\nSide a Kil a mox Indian Came to and offered to Sell Some roots of which\r\nI did not want, he had a robe made of 2 large Sea otter Skins which I\r\noffered to purchase, but he would not part with them, we returned by\r\nnearly the Same rout which I had Come out, at four miles, I met Gibson\r\n& Shannon each with a load of meat, they informed me that they had\r\nkilled Elk about 2 miles off, I directed 3 men to go with the hunters\r\nand help them pack the meat to the place they were makeing Salt, and\r\nreturn to the fort with Serjt. Gass, the balance of the party took the\r\nload of the 3 men, after crossing the 2d Creek frasure informed me that\r\nhe had lost his big knife, here we Dined, I put frasurs load on my\r\nguide who is yet with me, and Sent him back in Serch of his knife with\r\ndirections to join the other men who were out packing meat & return to\r\nthe fort all together. I arrived at the Canoes about Sunset, the tides\r\nwas Comeing in I thought it a favourable time to go on to the fort at\r\nwhich place we arrived at 10 oClock P M, found Several inidians of the\r\nCath'-lah-mah nation the great Chief Shahhar-wah cop who reside not far\r\nabove us on the South Side of the Columbia River, this is the first\r\ntime I have Seen the Chief, he was hunting when we passed his village\r\non our way to this place, we gave him a medal of the Smallest Size, he\r\npresented me with a basquet of Wappato, in return for which I gave him\r\na fish hook of a large Size and Some wire, those people Speak the Same\r\nlanguage with the Chinnooks and Clatsops, whome they all resemble in\r\nDress, Custom, manners &c. they brought Some Dried Salmon, Wappato,\r\nDogs, and mats made of rushes & flags to barter; their Dogs and part of\r\ntheir wappato they disposed of, and remained in their Camp near the\r\nfort all night.\r\n\r\nIn my absence the hunters from the fort killed only two Elk which is\r\nyet out in the woods. Capt. Lewis examined our Small Stock of\r\nmerchendize found Some of it wet and Dried it by the fire. Our\r\nmerchindize is reduced to a mear handfull, and our Comfort, dureing our\r\nreturn next year, much depends on it, it is therefore almost\r\nunnecessary to add that it is much reduced The nativs in this\r\nneighbourhood are excessively fond of Smokeing tobacco. in the act of\r\nSmokeing they appear to Swallow it as they draw it from the pipe, and\r\nfor maney draughts together you will not perceive the Smoke they take\r\nfrom the pipe, in the Same manner they inhale it in their longs untill\r\nthey become Surcharged with the vapour when they puff it out to a great\r\ndistance through their norstils and mouth; I have no doubt that tobacco\r\nSmoked in this manner becomes much more intoxicating, and that they do\r\npossess themselves of all its virtues to the fullest extent; they\r\nfrequently give us Sounding proofs of its createing a dismorallity of\r\norder in the abdomen, nor are those light matters thought indelicate in\r\neither Sex, but all take the liberty of obeying the dicktates of nature\r\nwithout reserve. Those people do not appear to know the use of\r\nSperitious licquors, they never haveing once asked us for it; I prosume\r\ntherefore that the traders who visit them have never indulged them with\r\nthe use of it; of whatever Cause this may proceed, it is a verry\r\nfortunate occurrence, as well for the nativs themselves, as for the\r\nquiet and Safty of those whites who visit them. George Drewyer visited\r\nthis traps in my absence and caught a Beaver & a otter; the beaver was\r\nlarge and fat, and Capt. L. has feested Sumptiously on it yesterday;\r\nthis we Consider as a great prize, it being a full grown beaver was\r\nwell Supplyed with the materials for makeing bate with which to Catch\r\nothers. this bate when properly prepared will entice the beaver to\r\nvisit it as far as he can Smell it, and this I think may be Safely\r\nStated at 1/2 a mile, their Sence of Smelling being verry accute. To\r\nprepare beaver bate, the Caster or bark Stone is taken as the base,\r\nthis is generally pressed out of the bladder like bag which Contains\r\nit, into a phiol of 4 ounces with a wide mouth; if you have them you\r\nwill put from 4 to 6 Stone in a phial of that Capacity, to this you\r\nwill add half a nutmeg, a Dozen or 15 grains of Cloves and 30 grains of\r\nSinimon finely pulverised, Stur them well together, and then add as\r\nmuch ardent Sperits to the Composition as will reduce it to the\r\nConsistancey of mustard prepared for the table, when thus prepared it\r\nresembles mustard precisely to all appearance. When you cannot precure\r\na phial a bottle made of horn or a light earthern vessel will answer,\r\nin all Cases it must be excluded from the air or it will Soon lose its\r\nVirtue; it is fit for use imediately it is prepared but becoms much\r\nStronger and better in 4 or 5 days and will keep for months provided it\r\nbe purfectly Secluded from the air. when Cloves are not to be had use\r\ndouble the quantity of allspice, and when no Spices can be obtained use\r\nthe bark of the root of the Sausafras; when Sperits cannot be had use\r\noil Stone of the beaver adding mearly a Sufficent quantity to moisten\r\nthe other materials, or reduce it to a Stiff paste. it appears to me\r\nthat the principal use of the Spices is only to give a variety to the\r\nScent of the bark Stone and if So the mace vineller, and other Sweet\r\nSmelling Spices might be employd with equal advantage. The Male Beaver\r\nhas Six stones, two which Contanes a Substance much like finely\r\npulverised bark of a pale yellow Colour and not unlike tanner's ooz in\r\nSmell, these are Called the bark Stones or castors; two others, which\r\nlike the bark stone resemble Small blatters, contain a pure oil of a\r\nStrong rank disagreable Smell, and not unlike train Oil, these are\r\nCalled the Oil Stones, and two others of Generation. The bark stones\r\nare about 2 inches in length, the others Somewhat Smaller, all are of a\r\nlong Oval form, and lye in a bunch together between the skin and the\r\nroot of the tail beneath or behind the fundiment with which they are\r\nClosely Connected and Seam to Communicate, the pride of the female lye\r\non the inner Side much like those of the hog they have no further parts\r\nof Generation that I can proceive, and therefore believe that like the\r\nbirds they Coperate with the extremity of the gut. The female have from\r\n2 to 4 young ones at a birth and bring forth once a year only which\r\nusially happins about the Latter end of May and beginning of June. at\r\nthis Stage She is Said to drive the Mail from the lodge, who would\r\notherwise distroy the young\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 11, 1806]\r\nSunday January 11th 1806.\r\nSent a party early this morning for the Elk which was killed on the\r\n9th. they returned with it in the evening; Drewyer and Collins also\r\nreturned without having killed anything. this morning the Sergt. of the\r\nguard reported the absence of our Indian Canoe, on enquiry we found\r\nthat those who came in it last evening had been negligent in securing\r\nher and the tide in the course of the night had taken her off; we sent\r\na party down to the bay in surch of her, they returned unsuccessfull,\r\nthe party also who went up the river and Creek in quest of the meat\r\nwere ordered to lookout for her but were equally unsuccessfull; we\r\nordered a party to resume their resurches for her early tomorrow; this\r\nwill be a very considerable loss to us if we do not recover her; she is\r\nso light that four men can carry her on their sholders a mile or more\r\nwithout resting; and will carry three men and from 12 to 15 hundred\r\nlbs. the Cuthlahmahs left us this evening on their way to the Catsops,\r\nto whom they purpose bartering their wappetoe for the blubber and oil\r\nof the whale, which the latter purchased for beads &c. from the\r\nKillamucks; in this manner there is a trade continually carryed on by\r\nthe natives of the river each trading some article or other with their\r\nneighbours above and below them; and thus articles which are vended by\r\nthe whites at the entrance of this river, find their way to the most\r\ndistant nations enhabiting it's waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 11, 1806]\r\nSaturday 11th of January 1806\r\nSent a party early this morning for the Elk which was killed on the 9th\r\nthey returned with it in the evining; This morning the Serjt. of the\r\nguard reported that our Indian Canoe had gone a Drift, on enquiry we\r\nfound that those who Came in it last evening had been negligent in\r\nSecureing her, and the tide in Corse of the night had taken her off; we\r\nSent a party down to the bay in Serch of her, they returned\r\nunsecksessfull, the party who went up the river and Creek after meat\r\nwere derected to look out for her but were equally unsecksessfull; this\r\nwill be a verry considerable loss to us if we do not recover her, She\r\nis so light that 4 men Can Carry her on their Sholders a mile or more\r\nwithout resting, and will Carry four men and from 10 to 12 hundred\r\npounds. The Cath IA mahs left us this evening on their way to the\r\nClatsops, to whome they perpose bartering their wappato for the blubber\r\n& Oil of the whale, which the latter purchased for Beeds &c. from the\r\nKil a mox; in this manner there is a trade Continually Carried on by\r\nthe nativs of the river each tradeing Some articles or other with their\r\nneighbours above and below them, and those articles which are Vended by\r\nthe whites at their enterance of this river, find their way to the most\r\ndistant nations inhabiting its waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 12, 1806]\r\nMonday January 12th 1806.\r\nThe men who were sent in surch of the canoe returned without being able\r\nto find her, we therefore give her over as lost. This morning sent out\r\nDrewyer and one man to hunt, they returned in the evening, Drewyer\r\nhaving killed seven Elk; I scarcely know how we should subsist were it\r\nnot for the exertions of this excellet hunter. At 2 P.M. the ballance\r\nof the party who had been left by Capt. C. arrived; about the same time\r\nthe two hunters also arrived who had been dispatched by Capt C. for the\r\npurpose of hunting on the 9th inst.; they had killed nothing. We have\r\nheretofore usually divided the meat when first killed among the four\r\nmesses into which we have divided our party leaving to each the care of\r\npreserving and the discretion of using it, but we find that they make\r\nsuch prodigal use of it when they hapen to have a tolerable stock on\r\nhand that we have determined to adapt a different system with our\r\npresent stock of seven Elk; this is to jerk it & issue it to them in\r\nsmall quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 12, 1806]\r\nSunday the 12th January 1806\r\nThis morning Sent out Drewyer and one man to hunt, they returned in the\r\nevening Drewyer haveing killed 7 Elk; I scercely know how we Should\r\nSubsist, I beleive but badly if it was not for the exertions of this\r\nexcellent hunter; maney others also exert themselves, but not being\r\naccquainted with the best method of finding and killing the elk and no\r\nother wild animals is to be found in this quarter, they are\r\nunsucksessfull in their exertions. at 2 P. M Serjt. Gass and the men I\r\nleft to assist the Salt makers in Carrying in their meat arrived also\r\nthe hunters which I directed to hunt in the point, they killed\r\nnothing-. We have heretofore devided the meat when first killed among\r\nthe four messes, into which we have divided our party, leaveing to each\r\nthe Care of preserving and distribution of useing it; but we find that\r\nthey make such prodigal use of it when they happen to have a tolerable\r\nStock on hand, that we are determined to adapt a Different System with\r\nour present stock of Seven Elk; this is to jurk it and issue it to them\r\nin Small quantities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 13, 1806]\r\nTuesday January 13th 1806.\r\nThis morning I took all the men who could be spared from the Fort and\r\nset out in quest of the flesh of the seven Elk that were killed\r\nyesterday, we found it in good order being untouched by the wolves, of\r\nwhich indeed there are but few in this country; at 1 P.M. we returned\r\nhaving gotten all the meat to the fort. this evening we exhausted the\r\nlast of our candles, but fortunately had taken the precaution to bring\r\nwith us moulds and wick, by means of which and some Elk's tallow in our\r\npossession we do not yet consider ourselves destitute of this necessary\r\narticle; the Elk we have killed have a very small portion of tallow.\r\n\r\nThe traders usually arrive in this quarter, as has been before\r\nobserved, in the month of April, and remain untill October; when here\r\nthey lay at anchor in a bay within Cape Disappointment on the N. side\r\nof the river; here they are visited by the natives in their canoes who\r\nrun along side and barter their comodities with them, their being no\r\nhouses or fortification on shore for that purpose. the nations who\r\nrepare thither are fist, those of the sea coast S. E. of the entrance\r\nof the river, who reside in the order in which their names are\r\nmentioned, begining at the entrance of the river (viz) The Clatsop,\r\nKillamuck, Ne-cost, Nat-ti, Nat-chies, Tarl-che, E-slitch, You-cone and\r\nSo-see. secondly those inhabiting the N. W. coast begining at the\r\nentrance of the river and mentioned in the same order; the Chinnook and\r\nChiltch the latter very numerous; and thirdly the Cath-lah-mah, and\r\nSkil-lutes, the latter numerous and inhabiting the river from a few\r\nmiles above the marshey Islands, where the Cuth-lahmahs cease, to the\r\ngrand rappids. These last may be esteemed the principal carryers or\r\nintermediate traders betwen the whites and the Indians of the Sea\r\nCoast, and the E-ne-shurs, the E-chee-lutes, and the Chil-luckkit-te\r\nquaws, who inhabit the river above, to the grand falls inclusive, and\r\nwho prepare most of the pounded fish which is brought to market. The\r\nbay in which this trade is carryed on is spacious and commodious, and\r\nperfectly secure from all except the S. and S. E. winds, these however\r\nare the most prevalent and strong winds in the Winter season. fresh\r\nwater and wood are very convenient and excellent timber for refiting\r\nand reparing vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 13, 1806]\r\nMonday 13th January 1806\r\nCapt.

The Traders usially arrive in\r\nthis quarter, in the month of april, and remain until October; when\r\nhere they lay at anchor in a Bay within Cape Disapointment on the N.\r\nSide of the river; here they are visited by the nativs in their Canoes\r\nwho run along Side and barter their Comodities with them, their being\r\nno houses or fortification on Shore for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe nations who repare thither ar first those of the Sea Coast S. E & N\r\nW of the enterance of the river, who reside in the order in which their\r\nnames are mentioned to the S E. the Clat Sops, Kil-a-mox, and those to\r\nthe N W. the Chin nooks, and Chiltch; and Secondly the Cath-lah-mah,\r\nWar-ki-a-cum, and Skil-lutes, the latter noumerous and inhabiting those\r\nlast may be considered or intermedeate traders between the whites and\r\nnations on the Sea Coast, and the E-ne-churs, the E-chee-lutes, and the\r\nChil-luck-kitte-quaws, who inhabit the river up to the great falls\r\ninclusive, and who prepare most of the pounded fish which is brought to\r\nMarket.\r\n\r\nThe Bay in which the trade is Carried on is Spacious and Commodious,\r\nand perfectly Secure from all except the S. & S E Winds and those blow\r\nbut Seldom the most prevalent & Strong winds are from the S W & N W in\r\nthe Winter Season. fish water and wood are very Convenient and\r\nexcellent timber for refitting and repareing vessels.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 14, 1806]\r\nWednesday January 14th 1806.\r\nThis morning the Sergt. of the Guard reported the absence of one of the\r\nlarge perogues, it had broken the chord by which it was attatched and\r\nthe tide had taken it off; we sent a party immediately in surch of her,\r\nthey returned in about 3 hours having fortunately found her. we now\r\ndirected three of the perogues to be drawn up out of reach of the tide\r\nand the fourth to be mored in the small branch just above the landing\r\nand confined with a strong rope of Elk-skin. had we lost this perogue\r\nalso we should have been obliged to make three small ones, which with\r\nthe few tools we have now left would be a serious undertaking. a\r\nfatiegue of 6 men employed in jerking the Elk beaf.\r\n\r\nFrom the best estimate we were enabled to make as we dscended the\r\nColumbia we conceived that the natives inhabiting that noble stream,\r\nfor some miles above the great falls to the grand rappids inclusive\r\nannually prepare about 30,000 lbs. of pounded sammon for market. but\r\nwhether this fish is an article of commerce with the whites or is\r\nexclusively sold to and consumed by the natives of the sea Coast, we\r\nare at a loss to determine. the first of those positions I am disposed\r\nto credit most, but, still I must confess that I cannot imagine what\r\nthe white merchant's object can be in purchasing this fish, or where\r\nthey dispose of it. and on the other hand the Indians in this\r\nneighbourhood as well as the Skillutes have an abundance of dryed\r\nsammon which they take in the creeks and inlets, and I have never seen\r\nany of this pounded fish in their lodges, which I pesume would have\r\nbeen the case if they purchased this pounded fish for their own\r\nconsumption. the Indians who prepared this dryed and pounded fish,\r\ninformed us that it was to trade with the whites, and shewed us many\r\narticles of European manufacture which they obtained for it. it is true\r\nthey obtain those articles principally for their fish but they trade\r\nwith the Skillutes for them and not immediately with the whites; the\r\nintermediate merchants and carryers, the Skillutes, may possibly\r\nconsume a part of this fish themselves and dispose of the ballance of\r\nit the natives of the sea coast, and from them obtain such articles as\r\nthey again trade with the whites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 14, 1806]\r\nTuesday 14th January 1806\r\nThis morning the Serjt. of the guard reported the absence of one of our\r\nCanoes it had broken the Cord by which it was attached and the tide had\r\ntaken her off; we Sent a party imediately in Serch of her, they\r\nreturned in about 3 hours haveing fortunately found her. we now derect\r\nthat 3 of the canoes be drawed up out of reach of the tide and the 4th\r\nto be tied with a long Strong Cord of Elk Skins, ready for use. had we\r\nlost this large Canoe we Should have been obliged to make 3 other Small\r\nones, which with the fiew tools we have now left would be a Serious\r\nundertakeing. a fatiege of Six men employd in jurking the Elk beef.\r\nFrom the best estermate we were enabled to make as we decended the\r\nColumbia we Conceived that the nativs inhabiting that noble Stream\r\n(from the enterance of Lewis's river to the neighbourhood of the falls\r\nthe nativs Consume all the fish they Catch either for food or fuel)\r\nFrom Tow ar ne hi ooks River or a fiew mils above the Great falls to\r\nthe grand rapids inclusive anually prepare about 30,000 lbs of pounded\r\nfish (Chiefly Salmon) for market, but whether this fish is an article\r\nof Commerce with their neighbours or is exclusively Sold to, and\r\nConsumed by the nativs of the Sea coast, we are at a loss to determine\r\nthe latter of those positions I am dispose to credit most, as I cannot\r\nimagine what the white merchents objet Could be in purchaseing fish, or\r\nwhere they Could dispose of it. on the other hand the Indians in this\r\nneighbourhood as well as the Skillutes and those above have an\r\nabundance of Dryed Salmon which they take in the Creeks and inlets.\r\nthey are excessively fond of the pounded fish haveing frequently asked\r\nus for Some of it-. the Indians who prepared this pounded fish made\r\nSigns that they traded it with people below them for Beeds and trinkets\r\n&c and Showed us maney articles of European manufacture which they\r\nobtained for it; The Skillutes and Indians about the great rapids are\r\nthe intermediate merchants and Carryers, and no doubt Consume a part of\r\nthis fish themselves and dispose of the ballance of it to the nativs of\r\nthe Sea coast, and from this obtain Such articles as they again trade\r\nwith the whites.\r\n\r\nThe persons who usially visit the enterence of this river for the\r\npurpose of traffic or hunting, I believe is either English or\r\nAmericans; the Indians inform us that they Speak the Same language with\r\nour Selves, and gave us proofs of their varacity by repeating maney\r\nwords of English, Sun of a pitch &c. whether those traders are from\r\nNootka Sound, from Some other late establishment on this Coast, or\r\nimediately from the U States or Great Brittain, I am at a loss to\r\ndetermine, nor Can the Indians inform us. the Indians whome I have\r\nasked in what direction the traders go when they depart from hence,\r\nallways point to the S. W. from which it is prosumeable that Nootka\r\ncannot be their distination, and from Indian information a majority of\r\nthose traders annually visit them about the beginning of April and\r\nremain Some time and either remain or revisit them in the fall of which\r\nI cannot properly understand, from this Circumstance they Cannot Come\r\ndirectly from the U States or Great Brittain, the distance being to\r\ngreat for them to go and return in the ballance of a year. I am\r\nSometimes induced to believe that there is Some other Establishment on\r\nthe Coast of America South of this place of which little is but yet\r\nknown to the world, or it may be perhaps on Some Island in the Pacific\r\nOcian between the Continant of America & Asia to the S. W. of us. This\r\ntraffic on the part of the whites Consist in vending, guns, principally\r\nold British or American Musquets, powder, balls and Shote, brass tea\r\nkettles, Blankets from two to three points, Scarlet and blue Cloth\r\n(Coarse), plates and Strips of Sheet Copper and brass, large brass wire\r\nKnives Beeds &Tobacco with fishing hooks, buttons and Some other Small\r\narticles; also a considerable quantity of Salors Clothes, as hats,\r\nCoats, Trouses and Shirts. for those they receive in return from the\r\nnativs Dressed and undressed Elk Skins, Skins of the Sea otter, Common\r\nOtter, beaver, common fox, Speck, and tiger Cat, also Some Salmon dried\r\nor pounded and a kind of buisket, which the nativs make of roots called\r\nby them Shappelell. The nativs are extravigantly fond of the most\r\nCommon Cheap Blue and white beeds, of moderate Size, or Such that from\r\n50 to 70 will way one pennyweight, the blue is usially prefured to the\r\nwhite; those beeds Constitute the principal Circulating medium with all\r\nthe Indian tribes on this river; for those beeds they will dispose of\r\nany article they possess-. the beeds are Strung on Straps of a fathom\r\nin length & in that manner Sold by the breth or yard-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 15, 1806]\r\nThursday January 15th 1806.\r\nHad a large coat completed out of the skins of the Tiger Cat and those\r\nalso of a small animal about the size of a squirrel not known to me;\r\nthese skins I procured from the Indians who had previously dressed them\r\nand formed them into robes; it took seven of these robes to complete\r\nthe coat. we had determined to send out two hunting parties today but\r\nit rained so incessantly that we posponed it. no occurrence worthy of\r\nrelation took place today.\r\n\r\nThe implyments used by the Chinnooks Clatsops Cuthlahmahs &c in hunting\r\nare the gun the bow & arrow, deadfalls, pitts, snares, and spears or\r\ngigs; their guns are usually of an inferior quality being oald refuse\r\nAmerican & brittish Musquits which have been repared for this trade.\r\nthere are some very good peices among them, but they are invariably in\r\nbad order; they apear not to have been long enouh accustomed to fire\r\narms to understand the management of them. they have no rifles. Their\r\nguns and amunition they reserve for the Elk, deer and bear, of the two\r\nlast however there are but few in their neighbourhood. they keep their\r\npowder in small japaned tin flasks which they obtain with their\r\namunition from the traders; when they happen to have no ball or shot,\r\nthey substitute gravel or peices of potmettal, and are insensible of\r\nthe damage done thereby to their guns. The bow and arrow is the most\r\ncommon instrument among them, every man being furnished with them\r\nwhether he has a gun or not; this instrument is imployed\r\nindiscriminately in hunting every species of anamal on which they\r\nsubsist. Their bows are extreamly neat and very elastic, they are about\r\ntwo and a half feet in length, and two inches in width in the center,\r\nthence tapering graduly to the extremities where they are half an inch\r\nwide they are very flat and thin, formed of the heart of the arbor vita\r\nor white cedar, the back of the bow being thickly covered with sinews\r\nof the Elk laid on with a gleue which they make from the sturgeon; the\r\nstring is made of sinues of the Elk also. the arrow is formed of two\r\nparts usually tho sometime entire; those formed of two parts are\r\nunequally divided that part on which the feathers are placed occupyes\r\nfour fifths of it's length and is formed of light white pine reather\r\nlarger than a swan's quill, in the lower extremity of this is a\r\ncircular mortice secured by sinues roled arround it; this mortice\r\nreceives the one end of the 2nd part which is of a smaller size than\r\nthe first and about five inches long, in the end of this the barb is\r\nfixed and confined with sinue, this barb is either stone, iron or\r\ncopper, if metal in this form forming at it's point a greater angle\r\nthan those of any other Indians I have observed. the shorter part of\r\nthe arrow is of hearder wood as are also the whole of the arrow when it\r\nis of one piece only. as these people live in a country abounding in\r\nponds lakes &c and frequently hunt in their canoes and shoot at fowl\r\nand other anamals where the arrow missing its object would be lost in\r\nthe water they are constructed in the manner just discribed in order to\r\nmake them float should they fall in the water, and consequently can\r\nagain he recovered by the hunter; the quiver is usually the skin of a\r\nyoung bear or that of a wolf invariably open at the side in stead of\r\nthe end as the quivers of other Indians generally are; this\r\nconstruction appears to answer better for the canoe than if they were\r\nopen at the end only. maney of the Elk we have killed since we have\r\nbeen here, have been wounded with these arrows, the short piece with\r\nthe barb remaining in the animal and grown up in the flesh.--the\r\ndeadfalls and snares are employed in taking the wolf the raccoon and\r\nfox of which there are a few only. the spear or gig is used to take the\r\nsea otter, the common otter, spuck, and beaver. their gig consists of\r\ntwo points or barbs and are the same in their construction as those\r\ndiscribed before as being common among the Indians on the upper part of\r\nthis river. their pits are employed in taking the Elk, and of course\r\nare large and deep, some of them a cube of 12 or 14 feet. these are\r\nusually placed by the side of a large fallen tree which as well as the\r\npit lye across the toads frequented by the Elk. these pitts are\r\ndisguised with the slender boughs of trees and moss; the unwary Elk in\r\npassing the tree precipitates himself into the pitt which is\r\nsufficiently deep to prevent his escape, and is thus taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 15, 1806]\r\nFriday 15th of January 1806\r\nCapt.

The imployments used by the Chinnooks\r\nClatsops, Cath lah mahs Kil a mox &c. in hunting are the gun the bow &\r\narrow, dead falls, Pitts, Snares, and Spears or gigs; their guns are\r\nusially of an inferior quallity being old refuse american or brittish\r\nmuskets which have been repared for this trade there are Some verry\r\ngood pieces among them, but they are invariably in bad order they\r\nappear not to be long enough acquainted with fire arms to understand\r\nthe management of them. They have no rifles. Their guns and amunition\r\nthey reserve for the Elk, Deer, and Bear, of the two last however there\r\nare but fiew in their neighbourhoods. they keep their powder in Small\r\njapaned tin flasks which they obtain with their amunition from the\r\ntraders; when they happen to have no Ball or Shot they Substitute\r\nGravel and are insenceable of the dammage done thereby to their Guns.\r\n\r\nThe Bow and arrow is the most common instrement among them, every man\r\nbeing furnished with them whether he has a gun or not, this instrement\r\nis imployed indiscreminately in hunting every Species of animal on\r\nwhich they Subsist, Their bows are extreemly meet neat and very\r\nelastic, they are about two feet Six inches long and two inches wide in\r\nthe Center, thence tapering gradually to the extremities, where they ar\r\n3/4 of an Inch wide, they are very flat and thin, formed of the heart\r\nof the arbor vita or white Cedar, the back of the Bow being thickly\r\nCovered with Sinues of the Elk laid on with a Gleue which they make\r\nfrom the Sturgeon; the String is made of the Sinues of the Elk also,\r\nthe arrow is formed of two parts usually tho Sometimes entire; those\r\nformed of 2 parts are uneaquilly devided, the part on which the\r\nfeathers are placed occupie 4/5 of it's length and is formed of light\r\nwhite pine rather larger than a Swans quill, in the lower extremity of\r\nthis is a Circular mortice Secured by Sinues raped around it; this\r\nmortice recives the one end of the 2d part which is of Smaller Size\r\nthan the first and about five inches long, in the end of this the barb\r\nis fixed and Confined with Sinues, the berb is either Iron Copper or\r\nStone--in this form forming at its point a greater angle than those of\r\nany other Indians I have observed. The Shorter part of the arrow is of\r\nharder wood, as are also the whole of the arrow where it is of one\r\npiece only. as these people live in a Countrey abounding in Ponds lakes\r\n&c. and frequently hunt in their Canoes and Shoot at fowls and other\r\nanimals where the arrow missing its object would be lost in the water\r\nthey are constructed in the Manner just discribed in order to make them\r\nflote Should they fall in the water, and Consequently Can again be\r\nrecovered by the hunter; the quiver is useally the Skin of a young bear\r\nor that of a wolf invariably open at the Side in Sted of the end, as\r\nthe quiver of other Indians generally are, this Construction appears to\r\nanswer better for the Canoe, than if they were open at the end only.\r\nmaney of the Elk which our hunters have killd.

The gig consists of two points or birbs and are the\r\nSame in their Construction as those which are Common among the Indians\r\non the upper part of this river and before discribed. Their pitts are\r\nemployed in takeing the Elk, and of Course are large and Deep, Some of\r\nthem a Cube of 12 or 14 feet, those ar commonly placed by the Side of a\r\nlarge fallen tree which as well as the pitt lie across the roads\r\nfrequented by the Elk, these pitts are disguised with the Slender bows\r\nof trees & moss; the unwarry Elk in passing the tree precipates himself\r\ninto the Pitt which is Sufficiently deep to prevent his escape.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 16, 1806]\r\nFriday January 16th 1806.\r\nThis evening we finished curing the meat. no occurrence worthy of\r\nrelation took place today. we have plenty of Elk beef for the present\r\nand a little salt, our houses dry and comfortable, and having made up\r\nour minds to remain until the 1st of April, every one appears content\r\nwith his situation and his fare. it is true that we could even travel\r\nnow on our return as far as the timbered country reaches, or to the\r\nfalls of the river; but further it would be madness for us to attempt\r\nto proceede untill April, as the indians inform us that the snows lye\r\nknee deep in the plains of Columbia during the winter, and in these\r\nplains we could scarcely get as much fuel of any kind as would cook our\r\nprovision as we descended the river; and even were we happyly over\r\nthese plains and again in the woody country at the foot of the Rocky\r\nMountains we could not possibly pass that immence barrier of mountains\r\non which the snows ly in winter to the debth in many places of 20 feet;\r\nin short the Indians inform us that they are impracticable untill about\r\nthe 1st of June, at which time even there is an abundance of snow but a\r\nscanty subsistence may be obtained for the horses.--we should not\r\ntherefore forward ourselves on our homeward journey by reaching the\r\nrocky mountains early than the 1st of June, which we can easily effect\r\nby seting out from hence on the 1st of April.\r\n\r\nThe Clatsops Chinnooks &c. in fishing employ the common streight net,\r\nthe scooping or diping net with a long handle, the gig, and the hook\r\nand line. the common net is of different lengths and debths usually\r\nemployed in taking the sammon, Carr and trout in the inlets among the\r\nmarshey grounds and the mouths of deep creeks. the skiming or scooping\r\nnet to take small fish in the spring and summer season; the gig and\r\nhook are employed indiscriminately at all seasons in taking such fish\r\nas they can procure by their means. their nets and fishing lines are\r\nmade of the silk-grass or white cedar bark; and their hooks are\r\ngenerally of European manufactary, tho before the whites visited them\r\nthey made hooks of bone and other substances formed in the following\r\nmanner A C, and C. B. are two small pieces of bone about the size of a\r\nstrong twine, these are flattened and leveled off of their extremities\r\nnear C. where they are firmly attatched together with sinues and\r\ncovered with rosin. C A. is reduced to a sharp point at A where it is\r\nalso bent in a little; C B. is attatched to the line, for about half\r\nit's length at the upper extremity B. the whole forming two sides of an\r\naccute angled triangle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 16, 1806]\r\nSaturday 16th January 1806\r\nThis evening we finished cureing the meat. no occurrence worthey of\r\nrelation took place to day. we have a plenty of Elk beef for the\r\npresent and a little Salt, our houses dry and Comfortable, haveing made\r\nup our minds to Stay untill the 1st of April every one appears\r\ncontented with his Situation, and his fair. it is true we Could travel\r\neven now on our return as far as the timbered Country reaches, or to\r\nthe falls of the river, but further it would be madness for us to\r\nattempt to proceed untill april, as the indians inform us that the\r\nSnows lyes knee deep in the Columbian Plains dureing the winter, and in\r\nthose planes we could not git as much wood as would Cook our provisions\r\nuntill the drift wood comes down in the Spring and lodges on the Shore\r\n&c. and even were we happily over those plains and in the woodey\r\ncountrey at the foot of the rockey mountains, we could not possibly\r\npass that emence bearier of mountains on which the Snow lyes in winter\r\nto the debth in maney placs of 20 feet; in Short the Indians tell us\r\nthey impassable untill about the 1s of June, at which time even then is\r\nan abundance of snow but a Scanty Subsistance may be had for the\r\nhorses--we Should not foward our homeward journey any by reaching the\r\nRocky mountains earlier than the 1st of June which we can effect by\r\nSetting out from hence by the 1st of April\r\n\r\nThe Clatsops, Chinnooks &c. in fishing employ the Common Streight net,\r\nthe Scooping or dipping net with a long handle, the gig, and the hook\r\nand line. the Common nets are of different lengths and debths usually\r\nemployd in takeing the Salmon, Carr and trout in the inlets among the\r\nmarshey grounds and the mouths of deep Creeks,--the Skiming or scooping\r\nnets to take Smaller fish in the Spring and Summer Season; the gig and\r\nhook are employed indiscreminately at all Seasons in takeing Such fish\r\nas they Can precure by these means. their nets and fishing lines are\r\nmade of the Silk Grass or white Cedar bark; and their hooks are\r\ngenerally of European manufactory, tho before the whites visited them\r\nthey made their Hooks of bone and other Substances formed in the\r\nfollowing manner A C and B C are two Small pieces of bone about the\r\nSize of a Strong twine, these are flattened & beaveled off to their\r\nextremites at C, where they are firmley attached together and Covered\r\nwith rozin C A is reduced to a Sharp point at A where it is also bent\r\nin a little; C B is attached to the line, at the upper extremity B. the\r\nwhole forming two Sides of an accute angled triangle. the line has a\r\nloop at D which it is anexed to a longer line and taken off at\r\npleasure.

They brought with\r\nthem some roots and buries for sale, of which however they disposed of\r\nbut very few as they asked for them such prices as our stock in trade\r\nwould not license us in giving. the Chief Comowool gave us some roots\r\nand buries for which we gave him in return a mockerson awl and some\r\nthread; the latter he wished for the purpose of making a skiming net.\r\none of the party was dressed in three very eligant Sea Otter skins\r\nwhich we much wanted; for these we offered him many articles but he\r\nwould not dispose of them for any other consideration but blue beads,\r\nof these we had only six fathoms left, which being 4 less than his\r\nprice for each skin he would not exchange nor would a knife or an\r\nequivalent in beads of any other colour answer his purposes, these\r\ncoarse blue beads are their favorite merchandiz, and are called by them\r\ntia Commashuck or Chiefs beads. the best wampum is not so much esteemed\r\nby them as the most inferior beads. Sent Coalter out to hunt this\r\nmorning, he shortly after returned with a deer, venison is a rarity\r\nwith us we have had none for some weeks. Drewyer also set out on a\r\nhunting excertion and took one man with him. he intends both to hunt\r\nthe Elk and trap the beaver.\r\n\r\nThe Culinary articles of the Indians in our neighbourhood consist of\r\nwooden bowls or throughs, baskets, wooden spoons and woden scures or\r\nspits. Their wooden bowls and troughs are of different forms and sizes,\r\nand most generally dug out of a solid piece; they are ither round or\r\nsimi globular, in the form of a canoe, cubic, and cubic at top\r\nterminating in a globe at bottom; these are extreemly well executed and\r\nmany of them neatly carved the larger vessels with hand-holes to them;\r\nin these vessels they boil their fish or flesh by means of hot stones\r\nwhich they immerce in the water with the article to be boiled. they\r\nalso render the oil of fish or other anamals in the same manner. their\r\nbaskets are formed of cedar bark and beargrass so closely interwoven\r\nwith the fingers that they are watertight without the aid of gum or\r\nrosin; some of these are highly ornamented with strans of beargrass\r\nwhich they dye of several colours and interweave in a great variety of\r\nfigures; this serves them the double perpose of holding their water or\r\nwearing on their heads; and are of different capacites from that of the\r\nsmallest cup to five or six gallons; they are generally of a conic form\r\nor reather the segment of a cone of which the smaller end forms the\r\nbase or bottom of the basket. these they make very expediciously and\r\ndispose off for a mear trifle. it is for the construction of these\r\nbaskets that the beargrass becomes an article of traffic among the\r\nnatives this grass grows only on their high mountains near the snowey\r\nregion; the blade is about 3/8 of an inch wide and 2 feet long smoth\r\npliant and strong; the young blades which are white from not being\r\nexposed to the sun or air, are those most commonly employed,\r\nparticularly in their neatest work. Their spoons are not remarkable nor\r\nabundant, they are generally large and the bole brawd. their meat is\r\nroasted with a sharp scure, one end of which is incerted in the meat\r\nwith the other is set erect in the ground. the spit for roasting fish\r\nhas it's upper extremity split, and between it's limbs the center of\r\nthe fish is inscerted with it's head downwards and the tale and\r\nextremities of the scure secured with a string, the sides of the fish,\r\nwhich was in the first instance split on the back, are expanded by\r\nmeans of small splinters of wood which extend crosswise the fish. a\r\nsmall mat of rushes or flags is the usual plate or dish on which their\r\nfish, flesh, roots or burries are served. they make a number of bags\r\nand baskets not watertight of cedar bark, silk-grass, rushes, flags and\r\ncommon coarse sedge. in these they secure their dryed fish, rooots,\r\nburies, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 17, 1806]\r\nSunday 17th January 1806\r\nThis morning we were visited by Comowool and 7 of the Clatsops our\r\nnearest neighbours, who left us again in the evening. They brought with\r\nthem Some roots and beries for Sale, of which however they disposed of\r\nvery fiew as they asked for them Such prices as our Stock in trade\r\nwould not licence us in giveing. The Chief Comowool gave us Some roots\r\nand berries, for which we gave him in return a mockerson awl and Some\r\nthread; the latter he wished for the purpose of makeing a Skiming Net.\r\none of the party was dressed in three verry elegant Sea otter Skins\r\nwhich we much wanted; for these we offered him maney articles but he\r\nwould not dispose of them for aney other Consideration but Blue beeds,\r\nof those we had only Six fathoms left, which being 4 less than his\r\nprice for each Skin he would not exchange nor would a Knife or any\r\nother equivolent in beeds of aney other Colour answer his purpose;\r\nthese Coarse blue beeds are their favourite merchandize and are Called\r\nby them Tia com ma shuck or Chief beeds, the best Wampom is not as much\r\nesteemed by them as the most indifferent beeds. Sent Colter out to hunt\r\nhe Shortly after returned with a Deer, Venison is a rarity with us we\r\nhave had none for Some weeks. Drewyer Set out on a hunting expedition\r\none man went with him. he intends to hunt the Elk and trap the beaver.\r\n\r\nThe Culianary articles of the Indians in our neighbourhood Consists of\r\nwooden bowls or troughs, Baskets, Shell and wooden Spoons and wooden\r\nScures or Spits, their wooden Bowles and troughs are of different forms\r\nand Sizes, and most generally dug out of Solid piecies; they are either\r\nround, Square or in the form of a canoe; those are extreemly well\r\nexecuted and maney of them neetly covered, the larger vessels with\r\nhandholes to them; in these vessels they boil their fish or flesh by\r\nmeans of hot Stones which they immerce in the water with the articles\r\nto be boiled. They also render the Oil of the fish, or other animals in\r\nthe Same manner. Their baskets are formed of Cedar bark and bargrass So\r\nclosely interwoven withe hands or fingers that they are watertight\r\nwithout the aid of gum or rozin; Some of those are highly ornimented\r\nwith the Straps of bargrass which they dye of Several Colours and\r\ninterweave in a great variety of figures; this Serves a double purpose\r\nof holding the Water or wareing on their heads; and are of different\r\nCapacities, from that of a Smallest Cup to five or Six gallons, they\r\nare generally of a Conic form or reather the Segment of a Cone of which\r\nthe Smaller end forms the base or bottom of the basket. these they make\r\nverry expediciously and dispose of for a mear trifle. it is for the\r\nConstruction of those baskets that Bargrass becoms an article of\r\ntraffic among the nativs of the Columbia. this grass grows only on\r\ntheir mountains near the Snowey region; the blade is about 3/8 of an\r\ninch wide and 2 feet long Smothe plient & Strong; the young blades\r\nwhich are white from not being exposed to the Sun or air, are those\r\nwhich are most Commonly employ'd, particularly in their neatest work.\r\nTheir wooden Spoons are not remarkable nor abundant, they are large &\r\nthe bowls broad. their meat is roasted with a Sharp Scure, one end of\r\nwhich is incerted in the meat while the other is Set erect in the\r\nground. The Spit for roasting fish has its upper extremity Split, and\r\nbetween its limbs the Center of the fish is incerted with its head\r\ndownwards, and the tale and the extremities of the Scure Secured with a\r\nString, the Side of the fish, which was in the first instance Split in\r\nthe back, are expanded by means of Small Splinters of wood which extend\r\nCrosswise the fish. a Small mat of rushes or flags is the usual plate,\r\nor Dish on which their fish, flesh, roots & berries are Served. they\r\nmake a number of Bags and Baskets not water tight of Cedar bark Silk\r\nGrass, rushes, flags, and common Gorse Sedge-. in those they Secure\r\ntheir dried fish, roots berries &.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 18, 1806]\r\nSunday January 18th 1806.\r\nTwo of the Clatsops who were here yesterday returned today for a dog\r\nthey had left; they remained with us a few hours and departed. no\r\nfurther occurrence worthy of relation took place. the men are still\r\nmuch engaged in dressing skins in order to cloath themselves and\r\nprepare for our homeward journey. The Clatsops Chinnooks &c construct\r\ntheir houses of timber altogether. they are from 14 to 20 feet wide and\r\nfrom 20 to 60 feet in length, and acommodate one or more families\r\nsometimes three or four families reside in the same room. thes houses\r\nare also divided by a partition of boards, but this happens only in the\r\nlargest houses as the rooms are always large compared with the number\r\nof inhabitants. these houses are constructed in the following manner;\r\ntwo or more posts of split timber agreeably to the number of divisions\r\nor partitions are furst provided, these are sunk in the ground at one\r\nend and rise perpendicularly to the hight of 14 or 18 feet, the tops of\r\nthem are hollowed in such manner as to receive the ends of a round beam\r\nof timber which reaches from one to the other, most commonly the whole\r\nlength of the building, and forming the upper part of the roof; two\r\nother sets of posts and poles are now placed at proper distances on\r\neither side of the first, formed in a similar manner and parrallel to\r\nit; these last rise to the intended hight of the eves, which is usually\r\nabout 5 feet. smaller sticks of timber are now provided and are placed\r\nby pares in the form of rafters, resting on, and reaching from the\r\nlower to the upper horizontal beam, to both of which they are attatched\r\nat either end with the cedar bark; two or three ranges of small poles\r\nare now placed horizontally on these rafters on each side of the roof\r\nand are secured likewise with strings of the Cedar bark. the ends sides\r\nand partitions are then formed with one range of wide boards of abut\r\ntwo inches thick, which are sunk in the ground a small distance at\r\ntheir lower ends and stand erect with their upper ends Taping on the\r\noutside of the eve poles and end rafters to which they are secured by\r\nan outer pole lying parallel with the eve poles and rafters being\r\nsecured to them by chords of cedar bark which pass through wholes made\r\nin the boards at certain distances for that purpose; the rough roof is\r\nthen covered with a double range of thin boards, and an aperture of 2\r\nby 3 feet left in the center of the roof to permit the smoke to pass.\r\nthese houses are sometimes sunk to the debth of 4 or 5 feet in which\r\ncace the eve of the house comes nearly to the surface of the earth. in\r\nthe center of each room a space of six by eight feet square is sunk\r\nabout twelve inches lower than the floor having it's sides secured with\r\nfour sticks of squar timber, in this space they make their fire, their\r\nfuel being generally pine bark. mats are spread arround the fire on all\r\nsides, on these they set in the day and frequently sleep at night. on\r\nthe inner side of the hose on two sides and sometimes on three, there\r\nis a range of upright peices about 4 feet removed from the wall; these\r\nare also sunk in the ground at their lower ends, and secured at top to\r\nthe rafters, from these other peices ar extended horizontally to the\r\nwall and are secured in the usual method by bark to the upright peices\r\nwhich support the eve poles. on these short horizontal pieces of which\r\nthere are sometimes two ranges one above the other, boards are laid,\r\nwhich either form ther beads, or shelves on which to put their goods\r\nand chattles of almost every discription. their uncured fish is hung on\r\nsticks in the smoke of their fires as is also the flesh of the Elk when\r\nthey happen to be fortunate enough to procure it which is but seldom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 18, 1806]\r\nMonday 18th January 1806\r\nTwo of the Clatsops that were here yesterday returned to day for a Dog\r\nthey had left;

two or more posts of Split timber\r\nagreeably to the number of devisions or partitions are first provided,\r\nthese are Sunk in the ground at one end and raised pirpindicular to the\r\nhight of 12 or 14 feet, the top of them are hollowed So as to recive\r\nthe end of a round beem of timber which reaches from one to the other\r\nor the entire length of the house; and forming the ridge pole; two\r\nother Sets of posts and poles are then placed at proper distancies on\r\neither Side of the first, formed in a Similar manner and parrelal to\r\nit; those last rise to the intended hight of the eves, which is usially\r\nabout 5 feet,--Smaller Sticks of timber is then previded and are placed\r\nby pears in the form of rafters, resting on, and reaching from the\r\nlower to the upper horizontial beam, to both of which they are atached\r\nat either end with the Cedar bark; two or 3 ranges of Small poles are\r\nthen placed Horizontially on these rafters on each Side of the roof &\r\nare Secured likewise with Cedar bark. the ends, Sides, and partitions\r\nare then formed, with one range of wide boards of about 2 inches thick,\r\nwhich are Sunk in the ground a Small distance at their lower ends &\r\nStands erect with their upper ends lapping on the out Side of the eve\r\npoles and end rafters to which they are Secured by a outer pole lyeing\r\nparrelal with the eve pole and rafters being Secured to them by Cords\r\nof Cedar bark which pass through wholes made in the bods at Certain\r\ndistances for that purpose; the rough roof is then Covered with a\r\ndouble range of thin boards, and an aperture of 2 by 3 feet left in the\r\nCenter of the roof to admit the Smoke to pass. These houses are\r\ncommonly Sunk to the debth of 4 or 5 feet in which Case the eve of the\r\nhouse comes nearly to the Surface of the earth. in the Center of each\r\nroom a Space of from 6 by 8 feet is Sunk about 12 inches lower than the\r\nHoar haveing its Sides Secured by four thick boards or Squar pieces of\r\ntimber, in this Space they make their fire, their fuel being generally\r\ndry pine Split Small which they perform with a peice of an Elks horn\r\nSharpened at one end drove into the wood with a Stone. mats are Spred\r\naround the fire on all Sides, on these they Sit in the day and\r\nfrequently Sleep at night. on the inner Side of the house on two Sides\r\nand Sometimes on three, there is a range of upright pieces about 4 feet\r\nremoved from the wall; these are also Sunk in the ground at their lower\r\nend, and Secured at top to the rafters, from those, other pieces are\r\nextended horozontially to the wall and are Secured in the usial manner\r\nwith bark to the upright pieces which Support the eve pole. on these\r\nShort horizontial peics of which there are Sometimes two ranges one\r\nabove the other, boards are laid, which either form their beads, or\r\nShelves on which to put their goods and Chattles, of almost every\r\ndiscription. their uncured fish is hung on Sticks in the Smoke of their\r\nfires as is also the flesh of the Elk when they happen to be fortunate\r\nenough to precure it which is but Seldom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 19, 1806]\r\nMonday January 19th 1806.\r\nThis morning sent out two parties of hunters, consisting of Collins and\r\nWillard whom we sent down the bay towards point Adams, and Labuish and\r\nShannon whom we sent up Fort River; the fist by land and the latter by\r\nwater. we were visited today by two Clatsop men and a woman who brought\r\nfor sale some Sea Otter skins of which we purchased one, giving in\r\nexchange the remainder of our blue beads consisting of 6 fathoms and\r\nabout the same quantity of small white beads and a knife. we also\r\npurchased a small quantity of train oil for a pair of Brass armbands\r\nand a hat for some fishinghooks. these hats are of their own\r\nmanufactory and are composed of Cedar bark and bear grass interwoven\r\nwith the fingers and ornimented with various colours and figures, they\r\nare nearly waterproof, light, and I am convinced are much more durable\r\nthan either chip or straw. These hats form a small article of traffic\r\nwith the Clatsops and Chinnooks who dispose of them to the whites. the\r\nform of the hat is that which was in vogue in the Ued States and great\r\nBritain in the years 1800 & 1801 with a high crown reather larger at\r\nthe top than where it joins the brim; the brim narrow or about 2 or\r\n21/2 inches.\r\n\r\nSeveral families of these people usually reside together in the same\r\nroom; they appear to be the father & mother and their sons with their\r\nson's wives and children; their provision seems to be in common and the\r\ngreatest harmoney appears to exist among them. The old man is not\r\nalways rispected as the head of the family, that duty most commonly\r\ndevolves on one of the young men. They have seldom more than one wife,\r\nyet the plurality of wives is not denyed them by their customs. These\r\nfamilies when ascociated form nations or bands of nations each\r\nacknoledging the authority of it's own chieftain who dose not appear to\r\nbe heriditary, nor his power to extend further than a mear repremand\r\nfor any improper act of an individual; the creation of a chief depends\r\nupon the upright deportment of the individual & his ability and\r\ndisposition to render service to the community; and his authority or\r\nthe deference paid him is in exact equilibrio with the popularity or\r\nvoluntary esteem he has acquired among the individuals of his band or\r\nnation. Their laws like those of all uncivilized Indians consist of a\r\nset of customs which have grown out of their local situations. not\r\nbeing able to speak their language we have not been able to inform\r\nourselves of the existence of any peculiar customs among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 19, 1806]\r\nTuesday 19th of January 1806\r\nThis morning Sent out two parties of hunters, one party towards Point\r\nadams and the other party up Ne tel River by water. we were visited to\r\nday by two Clatsop men and a woman who brought for Sale Some Sea otter\r\nSkins of which we purchased one gave in exchange the remainder of our\r\nblue heeds Consisting of 6 fathoms, and the Same quantity of Small\r\nwhite beids and a knife. we also purchased a Small quantity of train\r\noil for a par of Brass arm bands, and a hat for Som fishinghooks. these\r\nhats are of their own manufactory and are Composed of Cedar bark and\r\nbear grass interwoven with the fingers and ornimented with various\r\nColours and figures, they are nearly water proof, light, and I am\r\nConvinced are much more dureable than either Chip or Straw,--These hats\r\nform a article of traffic with Clatsops an Chinnooks who dispose of\r\nthem to the whites, the form of the Hats is that which was in voge in\r\nthe U States and Great Britain in 1800 & 1801 with a high Crown rather\r\nlarger at the top than where it joins the brim, the brim narrow about 2\r\nor 21/2 inches.\r\n\r\nSeveral families of those people usially reside together in the Same\r\nroom; they appear to be the father mother with their Sons and their\r\nSons wives and children; their provisions appears to be in common and\r\nthe greatest harmoney appears to exist among them. the old man is not\r\nalways respected as the head of the family that duty generally devolves\r\non one of the young men. They have Sildom more than one wife, yet\r\nplurality of wives are not denyed them by their Customs. those families\r\nwhen associated form bands of nations each acknowledgeing the authority\r\nof its own Chieftains, who does not appear to be herititary, or has\r\npower to extend further than a mear repremand for any improper\r\ndeportment of the indevidual; the Creation of a Chief depends upon the\r\nupright Conduct of the individual his abiltity and disposition to\r\nrender Service to the Comunity, and his authority and the defference\r\npaid him is in extent equilibrio with the popolarity or volintary\r\nesteem he has acquired among the individuals of his band, or nation.\r\nTheir Laws like all uncivilized Indians Consist of a Set of customs\r\nwhich has grown out of their local Situations. not being able to Speak\r\ntheir language we have not been able to inform ourselves of the\r\nexistance of any peculiar Customs among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 20, 1806]\r\nTuesday January 20th 1806.\r\nVisited this morning by three Clatsops who remained with us all day;\r\nthe object of their visit is mearly to smoke the pipe. on the morning\r\nof the eighteenth we issued 6 lbs. of jirked Elk pr. man, this evening\r\nthe Sergt. repoted that it was all exhausted; the six lbs. have\r\ntherefore lasted two days and a half only. at this rate our seven Elk\r\nwill last us only 3 days longer, yet no one seems much concerned about\r\nthe state of the stores; so much for habit. we have latterly so\r\nfrequently had our stock of provisions reduced to a minimum and\r\nsometimes taken a small touch of fasting that three days full allowance\r\nexcites no concern.

The root of the thistle, called by the natives shan-ne-tahque\r\nis a perpendicular fusiform and possesses from two to four radicles; is\r\nfrom 9 to 15 Inces in length and about the size a mans thumb; the rhind\r\nsomewhat rough and of a brown colour; the consistence when first taken\r\nfrom the earth is white and nearly as crisp as a carrot; when prepared\r\nfor uce by the same process before discribed of the white bulb or\r\npashshequo quawmash, it becomes black, and is more shugary than any\r\nfuit or root that I have met with in uce among the natives; the sweet\r\nis precisely that of the sugar in flavor; this root is sometimes eaten\r\nalso when first taken from the ground without any preperation; but in\r\nthis way is vastly in-ferior. it delights most in a deep rich dry lome\r\nwhich has a good mixture of sand. the stem of this plant is simple\r\nascending celindric and hisped. the root leaves yet possess their\r\nvirdure and are about half grown of a plale green. the cauline leaf as\r\nwell as the stem of the last season are now dead, but in rispect to\r\nit's form &c. it is simple, crenate, & oblong, reather more obtuse at\r\nit's apex than at the base or insertion; it's margin armed with\r\nprickles while it's disks are hairy, it's insertion decurrent and\r\nposition declining. the flower is also dry and mutilad. the pericarp\r\nseems much like that of the common thistle. it rises to the hight of\r\nfrom 3 to 4 feet.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 21, 1806]\r\nThursday 21st of January 1806\r\nTwo of the hunters Shannon & Labieche returned haveing killed three\r\nElk, ordered a party to go in quest of the meat early tomorrow morning\r\nand the hunters to return and continue the chase-. the Indians left us\r\nabout 12 oClock.\r\n\r\nThe root of the thistle called by the nativs Chan-ne-tak-que is\r\npirpendicular and possesses from two to 4 radicles;

it was in very inferior order, in short the animals were poor.\r\nReubin Fields also remained with the other hunters Shannon & Labuish\r\nour late supply of salt is out. we have not yet heared a sentence from\r\nthe other two parties of hunter's who are below us towards Point Adams\r\nand the Praries.\r\n\r\nThere are three species of fern in this neighbourhood the root one of\r\nwhich the natves eat; this grows very abundant in the open uplands and\r\npraries where the latter are not sandy and consist of deep loose rich\r\nblack lome. the root is horizontal sometimes a little deverging or\r\nobliquely descending, frequently dividing itself as it procedes into\r\ntwo equal branches and shooting up a number of stems; it lies about 4\r\nInces beneath the surface of the earth. the root is celindric, with few\r\nor no radicles and from the size of a goose quill to that of a man's\r\nfinger; the center of the root is divided into two equal parts by a\r\nstrong flat & white ligament like a piece of thin tape on either side\r\nof this there is a white substance which when the root is roasted in\r\nthe embers is much like wheat dough and not very unlike it in flavour,\r\nthough it has also a pungency which becomes more visible after you have\r\nchewed it some little time; this pungency was disagreeable to me, but\r\nthe natives eat it very voraciously and I have no doubt but it is a\r\nvery nutricious food. the bark of the root is black, somewhat rough,\r\nthin and brittle, it easily seperates in flakes from the part which is\r\neaten as dose also the internal liggament. this root perennil. in rich\r\nlands this plant rises to the hight of from 4 to five feet. the stem is\r\nsmooth celindric, slightly groved on one side erect about half it's\r\nhight on the 2 first branches thence reclining backwards from the\r\ngrooved side; it puts forth it's branches which are in reallyty long\r\nfootstalks by pares from one side only and near the edges of the\r\ngroove, these larger footstalks are also grooved cilindric and\r\ngradually tapering towards the extremity, puting forth alternate\r\nfootstalks on either side of the grove near it's edge; these lesser\r\nfootstalks the same in form as the first put forth from forty to fifty\r\nalternate pinate leaves which are sessile, horizontal, multipartite for\r\nhalf their length from the point of insertion and terminating in a long\r\nshaped apex, and are also revolute with the upper disk smoth and the\r\nlower slightly cottanny. these alternate leaves after proceeding half\r\nthe length of the footstalk cease to be partite and assume the tongue\r\nlike form altogether. this plant produces no flower or fruit whatever,\r\nis of a fine green colour in summer and a beautiful) plant. the top is\r\nannual and is of course dead at present.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 22, 1806]\r\nFriday 22nd January 1806\r\nThe party Sent for the meat this morning returned with it in the\r\nevening; it was in verry inferior order, in Short the animals were\r\npore. Rieuben Field Shannon and Labiech remained in the woods to hunt.\r\nour late Supply of Salt is out. we have not heard a word of the other\r\nhunters who are below us towards point adams and the Praries. Some rain\r\nthis day at intervales\r\n\r\nThere are three Species of fern in this neighbourhood the root one of\r\nwhich the nativs eate; that of which the nativs eate produce no flowers\r\nwhatever or fruit of a fine green Colour and the top is annual, and in\r\nCourse dead at present.\r\n\r\nI observe no difference between the licorice of this Countrey and that\r\nCommon to maney parts of the United States where it is sometimes\r\nCultivated in our gardins-. this plant delights in a deep lose Sandy\r\nSoil; here it grows verry abundant and large; the nativs roste it in\r\nthe embers and pound it Slightly with a Small Stick in order to make it\r\nSeperate more readily from the Strong liggaments which forms the center\r\nof the root; this they discard and chew and Swallow the ballance of the\r\nroot; this last is filled with a number of thin membrencies like\r\nnetwork, too tough to be masticated and which I find it necessary also\r\nto discard. This root when roasted possesses an agreeable flavour not\r\nunlike the Sweet potato. The root of the thistle (described yesterday)\r\nafter undergoing the process of Sweting or bakeing in a kiln is\r\nSometimes eaten with the train oil also, at other times pounded fine\r\nand mixed with Cold water, untill reduced to the Consistancy of Gruel;\r\nin this way I think it verry agreeable. but the most valuable of all\r\ntheir roots is foreign to this neighbourhood I mean the Wappetoe.\r\n\r\nThe Wappetoe, or bulb of the Sagitifolia or common arrow head, which\r\ngrows in great abundance in the marshey grounds of that butifull and\r\nfertile vally on the Columbia commenceing just above the quick Sand\r\nRiver and extending downwards for about 70 miles. this bulb forms a\r\nprincipal article of trafic between the inhabitents of the vally and\r\nthose of their neighbourhood or Sea coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 23, 1806]\r\nFriday January 23rd 1806.\r\nThis morning dispatched Howard and Warner to the Camp of the Saltmakes\r\nfor a supply of salt.

The Indians witnissed Drewyer's shooting some\r\nof those Elk, which has given them a very exalted opinion of us as\r\nmarksmen and the superior excellence of our rifles compared with their\r\nguns; this may probably be of service to us, as it will deter them from\r\nany acts of hostility if they have ever meditated any such. My Air-gun\r\nalso astonishes them very much, they cannot comprehend it's shooting so\r\noften and without powder; and think that it is great medicine which\r\ncomprehends every thing that is to them incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nI observe no difference between the liquorice of this country and that\r\ncommon to many parts of the United states where it is also sometimes\r\ncultivated in our gardens. this plant delights in a deep loose sandy\r\nsoil; here it grows very abundant and large; the natives roast it in\r\nthe embers and pound it slightly with a small stick in order to make it\r\nseperate more readily from the strong liggament which forms the center\r\nof the root; this the natives discard and chew and swallow the ballance\r\nof the root; this last is filled with a number of thin membrenacious\r\nlamela like net work, too tough to be masticated and which I find it\r\nnecessary also to discard. this root when roasted possesses an\r\nagreeable flavour not unlike the sweet pittaitoe. beside the small\r\ncelindric root mentioned on the 20th inst., they have also another\r\nabout the same form size and appearance which they use much with the\r\ntrain oil, this root is usually boiled; to me it possesses a\r\ndisagreeable bitterness. the top of this plant I have never yet seen.\r\nThe root of the thistle after undergoing the prossess of sweating or\r\nbaking in a kiln is sometimes eaten with the train oil also, and at\r\nother times pounded fine and mixed with could water untill reduced to\r\nthe consistency of sagamity or indian mush; in this way I think it very\r\nagreeable. but the most valuable of all their roots is foreign to this\r\nneighbourhood I mean the Wappetoe, or the bulb of the Sagitifolia or\r\ncommon arrow head, which grows in great abundance in the marshey\r\ngrounds of that beatifull and firtile valley on the Columbia commencing\r\njust above the entrance of Quicksand River, and extending downwards for\r\nabout 70 Miles. this bulb forms a principal article of traffic between\r\nthe inhabitants of the valley and those of this neighbourhood or sea\r\ncoast. The instrument used by the natives in diging their roots is a\r\nstrong stick of 31/2 feet long sharpened at the lower end and it's\r\nupper inscerted into a part of an Elks or buck's horn which serves as a\r\nhandle, standing transversely with the stick or it is in this form A\r\nthe lower point, B the upper part or handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 24, 1806]\r\nSunday 24th of January 1806\r\nDrewyer and Bapteist laPage returned this morning in a large Canoe with\r\nCommowol and six Clatsops. they brought two Deer and three Elk and one\r\nelk Skin, haveing given the flesh of one other Elk they killed and\r\nthree Elk skins to the Indians as the price of their assistance in\r\ntransporting the ballance of the meat to the Fort; these Deer and Elk\r\nwere killed near pt.

I know not whether this\r\nfruit Can properly be denomonated a berry, it is a pulpy pericarp, the\r\nouter coat of which is a thin Smothe, capsule with from three to four\r\nCells, each containing a Seperate Single Seed in form and Colour like\r\nthat of the wild Crab apple The wood of this tree is excessively hard\r\nwhen Seasoned. The nativs make great use of it to form their wedges of\r\nwhich they Split their boards of Pine for the purpose of building\r\nhouses. those wedges they employ in common with those formed of the\r\nElks horn, in Splitting their fire wood and in hollowing out their\r\nCanoes. I have Seen the nativs drive the wedges of this wood into a\r\nsolid dry pine which it cleft without fractureing injuring the wedge in\r\nthe Smallest degree. we have also found this wood useful) to us for ax\r\nhandles, as well as glutt or wedges. The bark of this tree is chewed by\r\nour party in place of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is exceedingly ascid and resembles the flavor of the wild\r\nCrab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 29, 1806]\r\nThursday January 29th 1806.\r\nNothing worthy of notice occurred today. our fare is the flesh of lean\r\nelk boiled with pure water, and a little salt. the whale blubber which\r\nwe have used very sparingly is now exhausted. on this food I do not\r\nfeel strong, but enjoy the most perfect health;--a keen appetite\r\nsupplys in a great degree the want of more luxurious sauses or dishes,\r\nand still render my ordinary meals not uninteresting to me, for I find\r\nmyself sometimes enquiring of the cook whether dinner or breakfast is\r\nready.-\r\n\r\nThe Sac a commis is the growth of high dry situations, and invariably\r\nin a piney country or on it's borders. it is generally found in the\r\nopen piney woodland as on the Western side of the Rocky mountain but in\r\nthis neighbourhood we find it only in the praries or on their borders\r\nin the more open wood lands; a very rich soil is not absolutely\r\nnecessary, as a meager one frequently produces it abundantly. the\r\nnatives on this side of the Rockey mountains who can procure this berry\r\ninvariably use it; to me it is a very tasteless and insippid fruit.\r\nthis shrub is an evergreen, the leaves retain their virdure most\r\nperfectly through the winter even in the most rigid climate as on lake\r\nWinnipic. the root of this shrub puts forth a great number of stems\r\nwhich seperate near the surface of the ground; each stem from the size\r\nof a small quill to that of a man's finger; these are much branched the\r\nbranches forming an accute angle with the stem, and all more poperly\r\npocumbent than creeping, for altho it sometimes puts forth radicles\r\nfrom the stem and branches which strike obliquely into the ground,\r\nthese radicles are by no means general, equable in their distances from\r\neach other nor do they appear to be calculated to furnish nutriment to\r\nthe plant but reather to hold the stem or branch in it's place. the\r\nbark is formed of several thin layers of a smoth thin brittle substance\r\nof a dark or redish brown colour easily seperated from the woody stem\r\nin flakes. the leaves with rispect to their position are scatered yet\r\nclosely arranged near the extremities of the twigs particularly. the\r\nleaf is about 3/4 of an inch in length and about half that in width, is\r\noval but obtusely pointed, absolutely entire, thick, smoth, firm, a\r\ndeep green and slightly grooved. the leaf is supported by a small\r\nfootstalk of proportionable length. the berry is attatched in an\r\nirregular and scattered manner to the small boughs among the leaves,\r\ntho frequently closely arranged, but always supported by seperate short\r\nand small peduncles, the insertion of which poduces a slight concavity\r\nin the bury while it's opposite side is slightly convex; the form of\r\nthe berry is a spheroid; the shorter diameter being in a line with the\r\npeduncle.--this berry is a pericarp the outer coat of which is a thin\r\nfirm tough pellicle, the inner part consists of a dry mealy powder of a\r\nyellowish white colour invelloping from four to six proportionably\r\nlarge hard light brown seeds each in the form of a section of a\r\nspheroid which figure they form when united, and are destitute of any\r\nmembranous covering.--the colour of this fruit is a fine scarlet. the\r\nnatives usually eat them without any preperation. the fruit ripens in\r\nseptember and remains on the bushes all winter. the frost appears to\r\ntake no effect on it. these berries are sometimes geathered and hung in\r\ntheir lodges in bags where they dry without further trouble, for in\r\ntheir most succulent state they appear to be almost as dry as flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 29, 1806]\r\nFriday 29th January 1806\r\nNothing worthey of notice occured to day. our fare is the flesh of lean\r\nElk boiled with pure water and a little Salt. the whale blubber which\r\nwe have used very Spearingly is now exhosted. on this food I do not\r\nfeel Strong, but enjoy tolerable health-. a keen appetite Supplies in a\r\ngreat degree the want of more luxurious Sauses or dishes, and Still\r\nrenders my ordanary meals not uninteresting to me, for I find myself\r\nSometimes enquireing of the Cook whether dinner Supper or Brackfast is\r\nreadyindeed my appetite is but Seldom gratified, not even after I have\r\neaten what I conceve a Sufficency.-\r\n\r\nManey of the nativs of the Columbia were hats & most commonly of a\r\nconic figure without a brim confined on the head by means of a String\r\nwhich passes under the chin and is attached to the two opposit Sides of\r\na Secondary rim within the hat--the hat at top termonates in a pointed\r\nknob of a conic form, or in this Shape. these hats are made of the bark\r\nof Cedar and beargrass wrought with the fingers So closely that it\r\nCasts the rain most effectually in the Shape which they give them for\r\ntheir own use or that just discribed, on these hats they work various\r\nfigures of different colours, but most commonly only black and white\r\nare employed. these figures are faint representations of the whales,\r\nthe Canoes, and the harpooners Strikeing them.

This Shrub is an\r\nevergreen, the leaves retain their virdue most perfectly throughout the\r\nwinter even in the most rigid climate as on Lake Winnipic. the root of\r\nthis shrub puts foth a great number of Stems, which seperate near the\r\nsurface of the ground; each Stem from the size of a Small quill, to\r\nthat of a mans finger. These are much branched forming an accute angle\r\nwith the Stem, and all more properly procumbent than crossing, for\r\naltho it sometimes puts foth radicles from the Stems and branches which\r\nStrike obliquely into the ground, those radicles are by no means\r\ngeneral, equable in their distances from each other nor do they appear\r\nto be calculated to furnish nutriment to the plant but rather to hold\r\nthe Stem or branch in its place. the bark is formed of several thin\r\nlayers of a Smothe thin brittle substance of a redish brown colour\r\neasily seperated from the woody Stem in flakes. the leaves with respect\r\nto their possition are scatter'd yet closely arranged near the\r\nextremities of the twigs particularly. the leaves are about 3/4 of an\r\ninch in length and about half that in width, is oval but obtusely\r\npointed, absolutely entire, thick, Smoth, firm, a deep green and\r\nslightly grooved. the leaf is Supported by a Small footstalk of\r\npreportionable length. the berry is attached in an irregular and\r\nScattered manner to the Small boughs among the leaves, tho frequently\r\nClosely arranged, but always Supported by a Seperate Short and Small\r\npeduncles, the incersion of which produces a Small concavity in the\r\nberry while its opposit side is Slightly convex; the form of the berry\r\nis a Spheroid, the Shorter diameter being in a line with the peduncle\r\nor Stem-. this berry is a pericarp the outer Coat of which is a thin\r\nfirm tough pellicle, the inner part consists of dry mealy powder of a\r\nyellowish white colour invelloping from four to six propotionably large\r\nhard light brown seeds each in the form of section of a spheroid which\r\nfigure they form when united, and are distitute of any membranous\r\ncovering.--the colour of this fruit is a fine scarlet. the nativs\r\nusually eat them without any preparation. the fruit ripens in September\r\nand remains on the bushes all winter. the frost appears to take no\r\neffects on it. these berries are Sometimes gathered and hung in their\r\nhouses in bags where they dry without further trouble, for in their\r\nsucculent State they appear to be almost as dry as flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, January 31, 1806]\r\nSaturday January 31st 1806.\r\nSent a party of eight men up the river this morning to renew their\r\nsurch for the Elk and also to hunt; they proceded but a few miles\r\nbefore they found the river so obstructed with ice that they were\r\nobliged to return. Joseph Fields arrived this evening, informed us that\r\nhe had been hunting in company with Gibson and Willard for the last\r\nfive days in order to obtain some meat for himself and the other Salt\r\nmakers, and that he had been unsuccessfull untill yesday evening when\r\nhe had fortunately killed two Elk, about six miles distant from this\r\nplace and about 8 from the salt works; he left Gibson and Willard to\r\ndry the meat of these Elk and had come for the assistance of some men\r\nto carry the meat to the salt camp; for this purpose we ordered four\r\nmen to accompany him early in the morning. discovered that McNeal had\r\nthe pox, gave him medecine. Charbono found a bird dead lying near the\r\nfort this morning and brought it to me I immediately recognized it to\r\nbe of the same kind of that which I had seen in the Rocky mountains on\r\nthe morning of the 20th of September last. this bird is about the size\r\nas near as may be of the robbin. it's contour also is precisely the\r\nsame with that bird. it measures one foot 31/4 Inches from tip to tip\r\nof the wings when extended. 91/4 inches from the extremity of the beak\r\nto that of the tail. the tail is 33/4 inches in length, and composed of\r\neleven feathers of the same length. The beak is smoth, black, convex\r\nand cultrated; one and 1/8 inches from the point to the opening of the\r\nchaps and 3/4 only uncovered with feathers; the upper chap exceeds the\r\nother a little in length. a few small black hairs garnish the sides of\r\nthe base of the upper chap. the eye is of a uniform deep sea green or\r\nblack, moderately large. it's legs feet and tallons are white; the legs\r\nare an inch and a 1/4 in length and smoth; four toes on each foot, of\r\nwhich that in front is the same length with the leg including the\r\nlength of the tallon, which is 4 lines; the three remaining toes are\r\n3/4 of an inch, each armed with proportionably long tallons. the toes\r\nare slightly imbricated. the tallons are curved and sharply pointed.\r\nThe crown of the head from the beak back to the neck, the back of the\r\nneck imbracing reather more than half the circumpherence of the neck,\r\nthe back and tale, are of bluish dark brown; the two outer feathers of\r\nthe tale have a little dash of white near their tips not percemtible\r\nwhen the tail is foalded. a fine black forms the ground of the wings;\r\ntwo stripes of the same colour pass on either side of the head from the\r\nbase of the beak along the side of the head to it's junction with the\r\nneck, and imbraces the eye to it's upper edge; a third stripe of the\r\nsame colour 3/4 of an inch in width passes from the sides of the neck\r\njust above the butts of the wings across the croop in the form of a\r\ngorget. the throat or under part of the neck brest and belly is of a\r\nfine yellowish brick red. a narrow stripe of this colour also commences\r\njust above the center of each eye, and extends backwards to the neck as\r\nfar as the black stripe reaches before discribed, to which, it appears\r\nto answer as a border. the feathers which form the 1st and second\r\nranges of the coverts of the two joints of the wing next the body, are\r\nbeautifully tiped with this brick red; as is also each large feather of\r\nthe wing on the short side of it's plumage for 1/2 an inch in length\r\ncommening at the extremity of the feathers which form the first or main\r\ncovert of the wing. this is a beatifull little bird. I have never heard\r\nit's note it appears to be silent. it feeds on berries, and I beleive\r\nis a rare bird even in this country, or at least this is the second\r\ntime only that I have seen it.--between the legs of this bird the\r\nfeathers are white, and those which form the tuft underneath the tail\r\nare a mixture of white and a brick red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, January 31, 1806]\r\nFriday January 31st 1806\r\nSent a party of Eight men with the hunters to renew their Serch for the\r\nElk, and also to hunt; they proceeded but a fiew miles before they\r\nfound the river So obstructed with ice that they were obliged to\r\nreturn.

The Eye is of a uniform deep Sea green or black, moderately\r\nlarge. it's legs feet and tallants are white; the legs are of 11/4 in\r\nlength and Smoth; four toes on each foot, of which that in front is the\r\nSame length of the leg including the tallants, which is 4 lines; the 3\r\nremaining toes are 3/4 of an inch, each armed with proportianably large\r\ntallons. the toes are Slightly imbricated. the tallons are curved and\r\nSharply pointed. The Crown of the head from the beak back to the neck\r\nimbracing rather more than half the circumphrence of the neck, the Back\r\nand tail is of a bluish dark brown; the two outer feathers of the tail\r\nhave a little dash of white near the tips, not proceivable when the\r\ntail is foalded. a fine black forms the ground of the wings; two\r\nStripes of the same colour passes on either side of the Head from the\r\nbase of the Back along the Side of the head to it's junction with the\r\nneck, and embraces the eye to its upper edge; a third Stripe of the\r\nSame Colour 3/4 of an inch in width passes from the Side of the neck\r\njust above the buts of the wings across the troop in the form of a\r\ngorget. the throat or under part of the neck brest and belly is of a\r\nfine Yellowish brick red. a narrow Stripe of this Colour also Commences\r\njust above the center of each eye, and extends backwards to the Neck as\r\nfar as the black Spots reaches before discribed, to which it appears to\r\nanswer as a border. the feathers which form the 1st and Second range of\r\nthe coverts of the two joints of the wings next the body are butifully\r\naped with this Brick red; as is also each large feather of the wing on\r\nthe Short Side of its plumage for 1/2 an inch in length Comencing at\r\nthe extremity of the feather which form the first or main Covert of the\r\nwing. This is a butifull little bird. I have never herd its notes it\r\nappears to be Silent. it feeds on berries, and I believe is a rare bird\r\neven in this country-. between the legs of this bird the feathers are\r\nwhite, and those which form the tuft underneath the tail are a mixture\r\nof white and Brick red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 1, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 1st 1806.\r\nThis morning a party of four men set out with Joseph Fields; Sergt.\r\nGass with a party of five men again set out up the Netul river in surch\r\nof the Elk which had been killed some days since, and which could not\r\nbe found in consequence of the snow. The Canoes of the natives\r\ninhabiting the lower portion of the Columbia River make their canoes\r\nremarkably neat light and well addapted for riding high waves. I have\r\nseen the natives near the coast riding waves in these canoes with\r\nsafety and apparently without concern where I should have thought it\r\nimpossible for any vessel of the same size to lived a minute. they are\r\nbuilt of whitecedar or Arborvita generally, but sometimes of the firr.\r\nthey are cut out of a solid stick of timber, the gunwals at the upper\r\nedge foald over outwards and are about 5/8 of an inch thick and 4 or\r\nfive broad, and stand horrizontally forming a kind of rim to the canoe\r\nto prevent the water beating into it. they are all furnished with more\r\nor less crossbars in proportion to the size of the canoe. these bars\r\nare round sticks about half the size of a man's arm, which are incerted\r\nthrough holes (just) made in either side of the canoe just below the\r\nrim of the gunwall and are further secured with strings of waytape;\r\nthese crossbars serve to lift and manage the canoe on land. when the\r\nnatives land they invariably take their canoes on shore, unless they\r\nare heavily laden, and then even, if they remain all night, they\r\ndischarge their loads and take the canoes on shore. some of the large\r\ncanoes are upwards of 50 feet long and will carry from 8 to 10 thousand\r\nlbs. or from 20 to thirty persons and some of them particularly on the\r\nsea coast are waxed painted and ornimented with curious images at bough\r\nand Stern; those images sometimes rise to the hight of five feet; the\r\npedestals on which these immages are fixed are sometimes cut out of the\r\nsolid stick with the canoe, and the imagary is formed of seperate small\r\npeices of timber firmly united with tenants and motices without the\r\nassistance of a single spike of any kind. when the natives are engaged\r\nin navigating their canoes one sets in the stern and steers with a\r\npaddle the others set by pears and paddle over the gunwall next them,\r\nthey all kneel in the bottom of the canoe and set on their feet. their\r\npaddles are of a uniform shape of which this is an imitation these\r\npaddles are made very thin and the middle of the blade is thick and\r\nhollowed out siddonly and made thin at the sides while the center forms\r\na kind of rib. the blade occupys about one third of the length of the\r\npaddle which is usually from 41/2 to 5 feet. I have observed four forms\r\nof canoe only in uce among the nations below the grand chatarac of this\r\nriver they are as follow. this is the smallest size about 15 feet long\r\nand calculated for one or two persons, and are most common among the\r\nCathlahmahs and Wack ki a cums among the marshey Islands. A the bow; B,\r\nthe stern; these are from twenty to thirty five feet and from two 1/2\r\nto 3 feet in the beam and about 2 feet in the hole; this canoe is\r\ncommon to all the nations below the grand rappids. it is here made\r\ndeeper and shorter in proportion than they really are.--the bowsprit\r\nfrom C, to D is brought to a sharp edge tapering gradually from the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThis is the most common forms of the canoe in uce among the Indians\r\nfrom; the Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw inclusive to the Ocean and is usually\r\nabout 30 or 35 feet long, and will carry from ten to twelve persons. 4\r\nmen are competent to carry them a considerable distance say a mile\r\nwithout resting. A is the end which they use as the bow, but which on\r\nfirst sight I took to be the stern C. D. is a comb cut of the sollid\r\nstick with the canoe and projects from the center of the end of the\r\ncanoe being about 1 inch thirck it's sides parallel and edge at C D.\r\nsharp. it is from 9 to 11 Inches in length and extends from the\r\nunderpart of the bowsprit at A to the bottom of the canoe at D.--the\r\nstern B. is mearly rounding and graduly ascending. 1 2 3 represents the\r\nrim of the gunwalls about 4 Inches wide, reather ascending as they\r\nrecede from the canoe. 4 5 6 7 8 are the round holes through which the\r\ncross bars are inserted.\r\n\r\nThis form of canoe we did not meet with untill we reached tidewater or\r\nbelow the grand rappids. from thence down it is common to all the\r\nnations but more particularly the Killamucks and others of the coast.\r\nthese are the largest canoes. B. is the bow and comb. C. the stern and\r\ncomb. their immages are representations of a great variety of grotesque\r\nfigures, any of which might be safely worshiped without committing a\r\nbreach of the commandments.\r\n\r\nThey have but few axes among them, and the only too usually imployed in\r\nfelling the trees or forming the canoe, carving &c is a chissel formed\r\nof an old file about an Inch or an Inch and a half broad. this chissel\r\nhas sometimes a large block of wood for a handle; they grasp the\r\nchissel just below the block with the right hand holding the edge down\r\nwhile with the left they take hold of the top of the block and strike\r\nbackhanded against the wood with the edge of the chissel. a person\r\nwould suppose that the forming of a large canoe with an instrument like\r\nthis was the work of several years; but these people make them in a few\r\nweeks. they prize their canoes very highly; we have been anxious to\r\nobtain some of them, for our journey up the river but have not been\r\nable to obtain one as yet from the natives in this neighbourhood.-\r\ntoday we opened and examined all our ammunition, which had been secured\r\nin leaden canesters. we found twenty seven of the best rifle powder, 4\r\nof common rifle, three of glaized and one of the musqut powder in good\r\norder, perfectly as dry as when first put in the canesters, altho the\r\nwhole of it from various accedents has been for hours under the water.\r\nthese cannesters contain four lbs. of powder each and 8 of lead. had it\r\nnot have been for that happy expedient which I devised of securing the\r\npowder by means of the lead, we should not have had a single charge of\r\npowder at this time. three of the canesters which had been accedentally\r\nbruized and cracked, one which was carelessly stoped, and a fifth that\r\nhad been penetrated with a nail, were a little dammaged; these we gave\r\nto the men to make dry; however exclusive of those five we have an\r\nabundant stock to last us back; and we always take care to put a\r\nproportion of it in each canoe, to the end that should one canoe or\r\nmore be lost we should still not be entirely bereft of ammunition,\r\nwhich is now our only hope for subsistence and defence in a rout of\r\n4000 miles through a country exclusively inhabited by savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 1, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 1st 1806\r\nThis morning a party of four men Set out with Jo.

I have Seen the nativs\r\nnear the Coast rideing waves in these Canoes in Safty and appearantly\r\nwithout Concern when I Should it impossible for any vessel of the Same\r\nSize to have lived or kept above water a minute. they are built of\r\nArborvitia or white Cedar generally, but Sometimes of fir. they are cut\r\nout of a solid Stick of timber, the gunnals at the upper edge fold over\r\noutwards and are about 5/8 of an inch thick and 4 or 5 broad, and Stand\r\nout nearly Horizontially forming a kind of rim to the Canoe to prevent\r\nthe water beating into it. they are all furnished with more or less\r\nCross bars agreeably to thier sizes of the Canoe, those bars are round\r\nSticks about 1 inch and 1/2 diameter which are atached to the iner Side\r\nof the canoes a little below the rim on either Side with throngs of\r\nCedar bark which is incerted through holes and made fast to the ends of\r\nthe Stick, which is made Smaller than the other part of the Stick to\r\nprevent the cord Slipping off these cross bears Serve to Strengthen the\r\ncanoe, and by which they lift and manage her on land. when the nativs\r\nland they invariably take their Canoes on Shore unless they are heavily\r\nladined, and then even, if they remain all night, they discharge their\r\nloads and take the Canoe on Shore.\r\n\r\nSome of the large Canoes are upwards of 50 feet long and will Carry\r\nfrom 8 to 12 thousand lbs. or from 20 to 30 persons, and Some of them\r\nparticularly on the Sea Coast are waxed painted and ornimented with\r\ncurious images on bow and Stern; those images sometimes rise to the\r\nhight of five feet; the pedestile on which these images are fixed, are\r\nSometimes cut out of the Solid Stick with the Canoe, and the image is\r\nformed of Seperate pieces of timber firmly united with tenants and\r\nmortices without the appearance of a Single Spike or nail of any kind.\r\nwhen the nativs are engaged in navigateing their Canoes, one Sets in\r\nthe Stern and Stears with a paddle the others Set by pars and paddle\r\nover their gunnals next them, they all kneel in the bottom of the Canoe\r\nand Set on their feet. their paddles are of an uniform shape which this\r\nis an imitation those paddles are made verry thin and the middle of the\r\nblade is thick and hollowed out Suddenly, and made thin on the Sides,\r\nthe center forming a kind of ridge. the handle occupies about 1/8 of\r\nthe length of the paddle which is usually 4 to 41/2 feet in length. I\r\nhave observed five forms of Canoes only in use among the nativs below\r\nthe Grand Cataract of this river. they areas follows. this is the\r\nSmallest Size about 15 feet long, 12 and Calculated for one two men\r\nmearly to cross creeks, take over Short portages to navagate the ponds\r\nand Still water, and is mostly in use amongst the Clatsops and\r\nChinnooks. this is the next Smallest and from 16 to 20 feet long and\r\ncalculated for two or 3 persons and are most common among the\r\nWau-ki-a-cums and Cath-lah-mahs among the marshey Islands, near their\r\nvillages. A the bow; B the Stern; those are from 20 to 40 feet in\r\nlength and from 21/2 to 31/2 feet in the beam and about 2 feet deep;\r\nthis Canoe is common to all the nations below the grand Rapids it here\r\nmade deeper and Shorter in pertotion than the Canoe realy is, the bow\r\nsprit from C. to D. is brought to a Sharp edge tapering gradually from\r\nthe Sides. This is the most common form of the Canoes in use among the\r\nindians from the Chil-luck-kit-te quaw inclusive to the ocian and is\r\ncommonly from about 30 to 35 feet long, and will carry from 10 to 12\r\npersons. 4 men are competent to carry them a considerable distance Say\r\na mile without resting. A is the end the nativs use as the bow, but\r\nwhich on first Sight I took to be the Stern c. d. is a comb cut of the\r\nsolid wood with the Canoe, and projects from the Center of the end of\r\nthe Canoe being about 1 inch thick, it's Sides parallel and edge at c,\r\nd, Sharp it is from 9 to 11 inches in debth and extends from the under\r\npart of the bow sprit at A to the bottom at, d,. the Stern B is nearly\r\nrounding and gradually assending. 1, 2, 3, represents the rim of the\r\ngunnals about 4 inches wide, reather ascending as they recede from the\r\nCanoe. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, are the holes through which the String pass to\r\nfasten the round pieces which pass Crosswise the Canoe to Strengthen &\r\nlift her. This form of a canoe we did not meet with untill we reached\r\ntide water or below the Great Rapids. from thence down it is common to\r\nall the nations but more particularly the Kil a mox and others of the\r\nCoast. these are the largest Canoes, I measured one at the Kilamox\r\nvillag S S W of us which was ____ feet long ____ feet wide and ____\r\nfeet deep, and they are most Commonly about that Size. B is the how,\r\nand Comb. C, the stern and Comb. Their images are representations of a\r\ngreat variety of grotesque figures, any of which might be Safely\r\nworshiped without commiting a breach of the Commandments.\r\n\r\nThey have but fiew axes among them, and the only tool usially employd\r\nin forming the Canoe, carveing &c is a chissel formed of an old file\r\nabout an inch or 11/2 inchs broad, this chissel has Sometimes a large\r\nblock of wood for a handle; they grasp the chissel just below the block\r\nwith the right hand holding the top of the block, and Strikes backwards\r\nagainst the wood with the edge of the Chissel. a person would Suppose\r\nthat forming a large Canoe with an enstriment like this was the work of\r\nSeveral years; but those people make them in a fiew weeks. They prize\r\ntheir Canoes very highly; we have been anxious to obtain Some of them,\r\nfor our journy up the river but have not been able to obtain one as yet\r\nfrom the nativs in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTo day we opened and examined all our Ammunition, which has been\r\nSecured in leaden Canistirs. we found twenty Sevin of the best Rifle\r\npowder, 4 of Common rifle, 3 of Glaize and one of Musquet powder in\r\ngood order, perfectly as dry as when first put in the Canisters, altho\r\nthe whole of it from various accidince have been for hours under the\r\nwater. these Cannisters Contain 4 pounds of powder each and 8 of Lead.\r\nhad it not been for that happy expedient which Capt Lewis devised of\r\nSecuring the powder by means of the Lead, we Should have found great\r\ndificuelty in keeping dry powder untill this time-; those Cannisters\r\nwhich had been accidently brused and cracked, one which was carelessly\r\nStoped, and a fifth which had been penetrated with a nail; were wet and\r\ndamaged; those we gave to the men to Dry; however exclusive of those 5\r\nwe have an abundant Stock to last us back; and we always take Care to\r\nput a purpotion of it in each canoe, to the end that Should one Canoe\r\nor more be lost we Should Still not be entirely bereft of ammunition,\r\nwhich is now our only hope for Subsistance and defences in the rout of\r\n4,000 miles through a Country exclusively inhabited by Indians-many\r\nbands of which are Savage in every Sense of the word-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 2, 1806]\r\nSunday February 2cd 1806.\r\nNot any occurrence today worthy of notice; but all are pleased, that\r\none month of the time which binds us to Fort Clatsop and which\r\nseperates us from our friends has now elapsed. one of the games of\r\namusement and wrisk of the Indians of this neighbourhood like that of\r\nthe Sosones consists in hiding in the hand some small article about the\r\nsize of a bean; this they throw from one hand to the other with great\r\ndexterity accompanying their opperations with a particular song which\r\nseems to have been addapted to the game; when the individul who holds\r\nthe peice has amused himself sufficiently by exchanging it from one\r\nhand to the other, he hold out his hands for his compettitors to guess\r\nwhich hand contains the peice; if they hit on the hand which contains\r\nthe peice they win the wager otherwise loose. the individual who holds\r\nthe peice is a kind of banker and plays for the time being against all\r\nthe others in the room; when he has lost all the property which he has\r\nto venture, or thinks proper at any time, he transfers the peice to\r\nsome other who then also becoms banker. The Sosone and Minnetares &c\r\nhave a game of a singular kind but those divide themselves in two\r\nparties and play for a common wager to which each individual\r\ncontributes to form the stock of his party. one of them holdes the\r\npeice and some one of the opposite party gesses which hand contains if\r\nhe hits on the hand which contains it the peice is transferred to the\r\nopposite party and the victor counts one, if he misses the party still\r\nretain the peice and score one but the individual tranfers the peice to\r\nsome other of his own party; the game is set to any number they think\r\nproper, and like the natives of this quarter they always accompany\r\ntheir opperations with a particular song. the natives here have also\r\nanother game which consists in bowling some small round peices about\r\nthe size of Bacgammon men, between two small upright sticks placed a\r\nfew inches asunder, but the principals of the game I have not learn not\r\nunderstanding their language sufficiently to obtain an explanation.\r\ntheir boys amuse themselves with their bows and arrows as those do of\r\nevery Indian nation with which I am acquainted. these people are\r\nexcessively fond of their games of risk and bet freely every species of\r\nproperty of which they are possessed. They have a smal dog which they\r\nmake usefull only in hunting the Elk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 2, 1806]\r\nSunday February 2nd 1806\r\nNot any accurrence to day worthy of notice; but all are pleased, that\r\none month of the time which binds us to fort Clatsop, and which\r\nSeperates us from our friends, has now alapsed.\r\n\r\nThe games of amusements of the natives of this neighbourhood are\r\nSeveral, one of which is verry similar to one which the Sosone's &\r\nMinatare's are verry fond of and frequently play. they devide\r\nthemselves into two parties and play for a common wager to which each\r\nindividual Contributes to form the Stock of his party, one of them\r\nholdes the piece which is usually about the Size of a Bean, and Some\r\none of the oposit party gesses which hand Contains, if he hits on the\r\nhand which Contains it, the piece is transfired to the opposit party\r\nand the victor Counts one, if he misses the party Still retains the\r\npiece and scores one, but the individual transfirs the piece to Some\r\none of his own party; the game is Set to any number they think proper.\r\nthey always accompany their opperations with a particular Song. The\r\namusements of the boys of all nations which I am acquainted with are\r\ngenerally the Bows and arrows.\r\n\r\nAll nations of Indians with which I am acquainted are excessive fond of\r\ntheir games of risk, and bet away Species of property of which they are\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThe nativs of this neighbourhood have a Small Dog which they make\r\nusefull only in hunting the Elk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 3, 1806]\r\nMonday February 3rd 1806.\r\nAbout three o'clock Drewyer and La Page, returned; Drewyer had killed\r\nseven Elk in the point below us, several miles distant but can be\r\napproached with in 3/4 of a mile with canoes by means of a small creek\r\nwhich discharges itself into the bay on this side of the Clatsop\r\nvillage direct Sergt. pryor to go in quest of the meat, the wind was so\r\nhigh that they were unable to set out untill a little before sunset,\r\nwhen they departed; at 10 P.M. they return excessively could and\r\ninformed us that they could not make land on this side of the bay nor\r\nget into the creek in consequence of the tide being out and much lower\r\nthan usual. we are apprehensive that the Clatsops who know where the\r\nmeat is will rob us of a part if not the whole of it. at half after 4\r\nP.M.

Pryor with a party of five men set out again in quest of the Elk\r\nwhich Drewyer had killed. Drewyer and La Page also returned to continue\r\nthe chase in the same quarter. the Elk are in much better order in the\r\npoint near the praries than they are in the woody country arround us or\r\nup the Netul. in the praries they feed on grass and rushes,\r\nconsiderable quantities of which are yet green and succulet. in the\r\nwoody country their food is huckle berry bushes, fern, and an evergreen\r\nshrub which resembles the lore) in some measure; the last constitutes\r\nthe greater part of their food and grows abundantly through all the\r\ntimbered country, particularly the hillsides and more broken parts of\r\nit. There are sveral species of fir in this neighbourhood which I shall\r\ndiscribe as well as my slender botanicall skit will enable me and for\r\nthe convenience of comparison with each other shal number them. (No 1.)\r\na species which grows to immence size; very commonly 27 feet in the\r\ngirth six feet above the surface of the earth, and in several instances\r\nwe have found them as much as 36 feet in the girth or 12 feet diameter\r\nperfectly solid and entire. they frequently rise to the hight of 230\r\nfeet, and one hundred and twenty or 30 of that hight without a limb.\r\nthis timber is white and soft throughout and rives better than any\r\nother species which we have tryed. the bark skales off in irregula\r\nrounded flakes and is of a redish brown colour particularly of the\r\nyounger growth. the stem of this tree is simple branching, ascending,\r\nnot very defuse, and proliferous. the leaf of this tree is acerose,\r\n1/10th of an Inch in width, and 3/4 of an Inch in length; is firm, stif\r\nand accuminate; they are triangular, a little declining, thickly\r\nscattered on all sides of the bough, but rispect the three uppersides\r\nonly and are also sessile growing from little triangular pedestals of\r\nsoft spungy elastic bark. at the junction of the boughs, the bud-scales\r\ncontinue to incircle their rispective twigs for several yeas; at least\r\nthree years is common and I have counted as many as the growth of four\r\nyears beyond these scales. this tree affords but little rosin. it's\r\ncone I have not yet had an opportunity to discover altho I have sought\r\nit frequently; the trees of this kind which we have felled have had no\r\ncones on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 4, 1806]\r\nTuesday February 4th 1806\r\nSerjt. Pryor with a party of 5 men Set out again in quest of the Elk\r\nwhich Drewyer had Killed. Drewyer also returned to continue the Chase\r\nin the Same quarter. the Elk are in much better order in the point near\r\nthe praries than they are in the woodey Country around us or up the\r\nNetul. in the praries they feed on grass and rushes, which are yet\r\ngreen. in the woddey Countrey their food is huckleberry bushes, fern,\r\nand the Shal-lon an evergreen Shrub, which resembles the Lorel in Some\r\nmeasure; the last constitutes the greater part of their food and grows\r\nabundant through all the timbered Country, particularly the hill Sides\r\nand more broken parts of it. There are Several Species of Fir in this\r\nneighbourhood which I shall discribe as well as my botanicale Skill\r\nwill enable me, and for the Convenience of Comparrison with each other\r\nShall number them. (No. i,) a Species which grows to an emence size;\r\nverry commonly 27 feet in Surcumferonce at 6 feet above the surface of\r\nthe earth, and in Several instances we have found them as much as 36\r\nfeet in the Girth, or 12 feet Diameter perfectly Solid & entire. they\r\nfrequently rise to the hight of 230 feet, and 120 or 30 of that hight\r\nwithout a limb. this timber is white and Soft throughout and rives\r\nbetter than any other Species we have tried the bark Shales off in\r\narregular rounded flakes and is of a redish brown Colour, particularly\r\nof the younger growth, the Stem of this tree is simple branching,\r\nassending, not very defuse, and proliferous, the leaf of this tree is\r\naccerose 1/2 a line in width, and 3/4 of an inch in length; is firm\r\nStiff and accuminate; they are triangular, little declineing, thickly\r\nscattered on all Sides of the Bough, but respect the three upper Sides\r\nonly Growing from little triangular pedistals of Soft Spungy Elastic\r\nbark. at the junction of these bough's, the bud-scales continue to\r\nincircle the respective twigs for several years; at least 3 years is\r\ncommon and I have counted as maney as the groth of 4 years beyond these\r\nScales. this tree affords but little rozin. it's cone I have not yet\r\nhad an oppertunity to discover altho I have Sought it frequently; the\r\ntrees of this kind which we have fell'd have had no cones on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 5, 1806]\r\nWednesday February 5th 1806.\r\nLate this evening one of the hunters fired his gun over the swamp of\r\nthe Netul opposite to the fort and hooped.

Gass and a\r\nparty of men over; the tide being in, they took advantage of a little\r\ncreek which makes up in that direction nearly to the highlands, and in\r\ntheir way fortunately recovered our Indian Canoe, so long lost and much\r\nlamented. The Hunter proved to be Reubin Fields, who reported that he\r\nhad killed six Elk on the East side of the Netul a little above us; and\r\nthat yesterday he had heard Shannon and Labuishe fire six or seven\r\nshots after he had seperated from them and supposed that they had also\r\nkilled several other Elk. Filds brought with him a phesant which\r\ndiffered but little from those common to the Atlantic states; it's\r\nbrown is reather brighter and more of a redish tint. it has eighteen\r\nfeathers in the tale of about six inches in length. this bird is also\r\nbooted as low as the toes. the two tufts of long black feathers on each\r\nside of the neck most conspicuous in the male of those of the Atlantic\r\nstates is also observable in every particular with this.--Fir No. 2 is\r\nnext in dignity in point of size. it is much the most common species,\r\nit may be sad to constitute at least one half of the timber in this\r\nneighbourhood. it appears to be of the spruse kind. it rises to the\r\nhight of 160 to 180 feet very commonly and is from 4 to 6 feet in\r\ndiameter, very streight round and regularly tapering. the bark is thin\r\nof a dark colour, and much divided with small longitudinal\r\nintersticies; that of the boughs and young trees is somewhat smoth but\r\nnot so much so as the balsom fir nor that of the white pine of our\r\ncountry. the wood is white throughout and reather soft but very tough,\r\nand difficult to rive. The trunk of this tree is a simple branching\r\ndiffused stem and not proliferous as the pines & firs usially are but\r\nlike most other trees it puts forth buds from the sides of the small\r\nboughs as well as their extremities. the stem usually terminates in a\r\nvery slender pointed top like the cedar. The leaves are petiolate, the\r\nfootstalk small short and oppressed; acerose reather more than half a\r\nline in width and very unequal in length, the greatest length being\r\nlittle more than half an inch, while others intermixed on every part of\r\nthe bough are not more than a 1/4 in length. flat with a small\r\nlongitudinal channel in the upper disk which is of a deep green and\r\nglossey, while the uder disk is of a whiteish green only; two ranked,\r\nobtusely pointed, soft and flexable. this tree affords but little\r\nrosin. the cone is remarkably small not larger than the end of a man's\r\nthumb soft, flexable and of an ovate form, produced at the ends of the\r\nsmall twigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 5, 1806]\r\nWednesday February 5th 1806\r\nLate this evening one of the hunters fired off his gun over the marsh\r\nof the Netul opposit to the fort & hhoped. we Sent Sergt.

I find that there are 2 vilages of Indians living on the\r\nN. side of the Columbia near the Marshy Islands who call themselves\r\nWackki-a-cum. these I have hertofore Considered as Cath-lah-mahs. they\r\nspeak the same language and are the same in every other rispect.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 A species of fir which one of my men informs me is precisely the\r\nsame with that called the balsam fir of Canada. it grows here to\r\nconsiderable size, being from 21/2 to 4 feet in diameter and rises to\r\nthe hight of eighty or an hundred feet. it's stem is simple branching,\r\nascending and proliferous. it's leaves are sessile, acerose, one 1/8 of\r\nan inch in 1/16th of an inch in width, thickly scattered on all sides\r\nof the twigs as far as the growth of four preceeding years and rispect\r\nthe three undersides only the uper side being neglected and the under\r\nside but thinly furnished; gibbous, a little declining, obtusely\r\npointed, soft flexible, and the upper disk longitudinally marked with a\r\nslight channel; this disk is of a glossy deep green, the under one\r\ngreen tho paler and not glossy. this tree affords considerable\r\nquantities of a fine clear arromatic balsam in appearance and taste\r\nlike the Canadian balsam. smal pustules filled with this balsam rise\r\nwith a blister like appearance on the body of the tree and it's\r\nbranches; the bark which covers these pustules is soft thin smoth and\r\neasily punctured. the bark of the tree generally is thin of a dark\r\nbrown colour and reather smooth tho not as much so as the white pine of\r\nour county. the wood is white and soft.--(No. 4) is a species of fir\r\nwhich in point of size is much that of No. 2. the stem simple branching\r\nascending and proliferous; the bark of a redish dark brown and thicker\r\nthan that of No. 3. it is divided with small longitudinal interstices,\r\nbut these are not so much ramifyed as in species No. 2. the leaves with\r\nrispect to their position in regard to each other is the same with the\r\nbalsam fir, as is the leaf in every other rispect except that it not\r\nmore than 2/3ds the width and little more than half the length of the\r\nother, nor is it's upper disk of so deep a green nor so glossey. it\r\naffords no balsam and but little rosin. the wood also white soft and\r\nreather porus tho tough.--No 5. is a species of fir which arrives to\r\nthe size of Nos. 2 and 4, the stem simple branching, diffuse and\r\nproliferous. the bark thin, dark brown, much divided with small\r\nlongitudinal interstices and sometimes scaleing off in thin rolling\r\nflakes. it affords but little rosin and the wood is redish white 2/3ds\r\nof the diameter in the center, the ballance white, somewhat porus and\r\ntough. the twigs are much longer and more slender than in either of the\r\nother species. the leaves are acerose, 1/20th of an inch in width, and\r\nan inch in length, sessile, inserted on all sides of the bough,\r\nstreight, their extremities pointing obliquely toward the extremities\r\nof the bough and more thickly placed than in either of the other\r\nspecies; gibbous and flexeable but more stif than any except No. 1 and\r\nmore blontly pointed than either of the other species; the upper disk\r\nhas a small longitudinal channel and is of a deep green tho not so\r\nglossy as the balsam fir, the under disk is of a pale green.--No. 65\r\nthe white pine; or what is usually so called in Virginia. I see no\r\ndifference between this and that of the mountains in Virginia; unless\r\nit be the uncommon length of cone of this found here, which are\r\nsometimes 16 or 18 inches in length and about 4 inches in\r\ncircumpherence. I do not recollect those of virginia perfectly but it\r\nstrikes me that they are not so long. this species is not common I have\r\nonly seen it but in one instance since I have been in this\r\nneighbourhood which was on the border of Haley's bay on the N. side of\r\nthe Columbia near the Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 6, 1806]\r\nThursday February 6th 1806\r\nSent Serjt.

I find\r\nthat those people will all Steal.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 a Species of fir, which one of my men inform me is presisely the\r\nSame with that called the balsam fir of Canada. it grows here to\r\nconsiderable Size, being from 21/2 to 4 feet in diameeter and rises to\r\nthe hight of 100 or 120 feet. it's Stem is Simple branching assending\r\nand proliferous-. it's leaves are cessile, acerose, 1/8 of an inch in\r\nlength and 1/16 of an inch in width, thickly scattered on all Sides of\r\nthe twigs as far as the groth of four proceeding years, and respects\r\nthe three undersides only, the upper Side being neglected and the under\r\nSide but thinly furnished; gibbous a little declineing, obtusely\r\npointed, Soft flexable, and the upper disk longitudinally marked with a\r\nSlight Channel; this disk is of a glossy deep green, the under one\r\ngreen tho paler and not glossy. This tree affords a considerable\r\nquantity of a fine Clear arromatic Balsom in appearance and taste like\r\nthe Canadian balsom. Small pustuls filled with the balsom rise with a\r\nblister like appearance on the body of the tree and it's branches; the\r\nbark which covers these pustules is Soft thin Smothe and easily\r\npunctured. the bark of the tree is generally thin of a dark brown\r\ncolour and reather Smooth tho not as much so as the white pine of the\r\nU.

I see no\r\ndifference between this and that of the mountains in Virginia; unless\r\nit be the uncommon length of the cone of this found here, which are\r\nSometimes 16 or 18 inches in length and about 4 inches in Surcumfrance.\r\nI do not recollect those of Virginia, but it Strikes me that they are\r\nnot So long. this Species is not common I have Seen it only in three\r\ninstances since I have been in this neighbourhood, I saw a few on\r\nHaleys bay on the North Side of the Columbia River, a fiew scattering\r\non the Sea coast to the North on one of which I engraved my name-and\r\nSome on the S S E Side of E co la Creek near the Kil a mox nation, at\r\nwhich place I Saw the white & red Cedar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 7, 1806]\r\nFriday February 7th 1806.\r\nThis evening Sergt. Ordway and Wiser returned with a part of the meat\r\nwhich R. Fields had killed; the ballance of the party with Sergt. Gass\r\nremained in order to bring the ballance of the meat to the river at a\r\npoint agreed on where the canoe is to meet them again tomorrow morning.\r\nThis evening we had what I call an excellent supper it consisted of a\r\nmarrowbone a piece and a brisket of boiled Elk that had the appearance\r\nof a little fat on it. this for Fort Clatsop is living in high stile.\r\nIn this neighbourhood I observe the honeysuckle common in our country I\r\nfirst met with it on the waters of the Kooskooske near the Chopunnish\r\nnation, and again below the grand rappids In the Columbian Valley on\r\ntidewater. The Elder also common to our country grows in great\r\nabundance in the rich woodlands on this side of the rocky Mountains;\r\ntho it differs Here in the colour of it's berry, this being of a pale\r\nsky blue while that of the U States is a deep perple. The seven bark or\r\nnine-bark as it is called in the U States is also common in this\r\nquarter. There is a species of huckleberry common to the piny lands\r\nfrom the commencement of the Columbian valley to the seacoast; it rises\r\nto the hight of 6 or 8 feet. is a simple branching some what defuse\r\nstem; the main body or trunk is cilindric and of a dark brown, while\r\nthe colateral branches are green smooth, squar, and put forth a number\r\nof alternate branches of the same colour and form from the two\r\nhorizontal sides only. the fruit is a small deep perple berry which the\r\nnatives inform us is very good. the leaf is thin of a pale green and\r\nsmall being 3/4 of an inch in length and 3/8 in width; oval\r\nterminateing more accutely at the apex than near the insertion of the\r\nfootstalk which is at the base; veined, nearly entire, serrate but so\r\nslightly so that it is scarcely perceptible; footstalk short and there\r\nposition with rispect to each other is alternate and two ranked,\r\nproceeding from the horizontal sides of the bough only. The small pox\r\nhas distroyed a great number of the natives in this quarter. it\r\nprevailed about 4 years since among the Clatsops and distroy several\r\nhundred of them, four of their chiefs fell victyms to it's ravages.\r\nthose Clatsops are deposited in their canoes on the bay a few miles\r\nbelow us. I think the late ravages of the small pox may well account\r\nfor the number of remains of vilages which we find deserted on the\r\nriver and Sea coast in this quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 7, 1806]\r\nFriday February 7th 1806\r\nThis evening Serjt Ordway and wiser returned with a part of the meat\r\nwhich R.

Gass\r\nremained in order to bring the ballance of the meat to the river at a\r\npoint agreeed on, where the Canoe is to meet them again tomorrow\r\nmorning. This evening we had what I call an excellent supper it\r\nconsisted of a marrowbone, a piece of brisket of boiled Elk that had\r\nthe appearance of a little fat on it. this for Fort Clatsop is liveing\r\nin high Stile, and in fact fiesting-.\r\n\r\nIn this neighbourhood I observe the honeysuckle common in the U States,\r\nI first met with it on the waters of the Kooskooske near the Chopunnish\r\nNation, and again below the grand rapids in the Columbian Vally on tide\r\nwater. The Elder also common to our Countrey grows in great abundance\r\nin the rich wood land on this Side of the rocky mountains, tho it\r\ndiffers here in the Colour of its berry, this being of a pale Sky blue\r\nwhile that of the U, States is a deep purple. The Seven or nine bark as\r\nit is called in the U, States is also Common in this quarter. There is\r\na Species of huckkleberry Common to the piney lands from the\r\nCommencement of the Columbian Vally to the Sea coast; it rises to the\r\nhight of 6 or 8 feet, is a Simple branching, Somewhat defused Stem; the\r\nmain body or trunk is cilindric branches are green Smothe squar, and\r\nput foth a number of alternet branches of the Same Colour and form from\r\nthe two horizontal Sides only. the frute is a small deep purple berry\r\nwhich the nativs inform us is very good, the leaf is thin of a pale\r\ngreen and Small being 3/4 of an inch in length and 3/8 in width; oval\r\nterminateing more accoutely at the apax, than near the insersion of the\r\nfootstalk which is at the base vened nearly entire; footstalks Short\r\nand their position in respect to each other is alternate and too\r\nranked, proceeding from the horizontal Side of the bough only.\r\n\r\nThe Small Pox had distroyed a great number of the nativs in this\r\nquarter. it provailed about 4 or 5 yrs Sinc among the Clatsops, and\r\ndistroy'd Several hundreds of them, four of their Chiefs fell a victym\r\nto it's ravages. these Clatsops are Deposited in their Canoes on the\r\nbay a fiew miles below us. I think the late ravages of the Small Pox,\r\nmay well account for the number of remains of villages which I Saw on\r\nmy rout to the Kil a mox in Several places-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 8, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 8th 1806.\r\nSent Sergt.

W. coast. I think this strong circumstancial proof\r\nthat there is a stettlement of white persons at Nootka sound or some\r\npoint to the N. W. of us on the coast.\r\n\r\nThere is a species of bryer which is common in this neighbourhood of a\r\ngreen colour which grows most abundant in the rich dry lands near the\r\nwatercourses, but is also found in small quantities in the piny lands\r\nat a distance from the watercourses in the former situation the stem is\r\nfrequently the size of a man's finger and rises perpendicularly to the\r\nhight of 4 or 5 feet when it decends in an arch and becomes procumbent\r\nor rests on some neighbouring plants or shrubs; it is simple unbranched\r\nand celindric; in the latter situation it is much smaller and usually\r\nprocumbent. the stem is armed with sharp and hooked bryers. the leaf is\r\npeteolate ternate and resembles in shape and appearance that of the\r\nperple raspberry common to the Atlantic states. the fruit is a berry\r\nresembling the black berry in every rispect and is eaten when ripe and\r\nmuch esteemed by the natives but is not dryed for winter consumption.\r\nin the country about the entrance of the quicksand river I first\r\ndiscovered this bryer. it groows so abundantly in the fertile valley of\r\nColumbia and the Islands in that part of the river that the country\r\nnear the river is almost impenitrable in many places. the briary bush\r\nwith a wide leaf is also one of it's ascociates. the green bryer\r\nretains it's foliage and verdure untill late in December.--There are\r\nalso two species of firn which are common to this country beside that\r\nformerly discribed of which the natives eat the roots. these from their\r\ndisparity in point of size I shall designate the large and small firn.\r\nboth species continue green all winter.--The large farn, rises to the\r\nheight of 3 or four feet the stem is a common footstalk or rib which\r\nproceedes immediately from the radix wich is somewhat flat on two sides\r\nabout the size of a man's arm and covered with innumerable black coarce\r\ncapillary radicles which issue from every pat of it's surface; one of\r\nthose roots or a collected bed of them will send fourth from twenty to\r\nforty of those common footstalks all of which decline or bend outwards\r\nfrom the common center. these ribs are cylindric and marked\r\nlongitudinally their whole length with a groove or channel on their\r\nupper side. on either side of this grove a little below it's edge, the\r\nleafets are inserted, being shortly petiolate for about 2/3 ds of the\r\nlength of the middle rib commencing at the bottom and from thence to\r\nthe extremity sessile. the rib is terminated by a single undivided\r\nlanceolate gagged leafet. the leafets are lanceolate, from 2 to 4\r\ninches in length gagged and have a small accute angular projection on\r\nthe upper edge near the base where it is spuar on the side which has\r\nthe projection and obliquely cut at the base on the other side of the\r\nrib of the leafet. or which will give a better idea in this form. the\r\nupper surface is Smooth and of a deep green the under disk of a pale\r\ngreen and covered with a brown bubersence of a woolly appearance\r\nparticularly near the cental fiber or rib. these leafets are\r\nalternately pinnate. they are in number from 110 to 140; shortest at\r\nthe two extremities of the common footstalk and longest in the center,\r\ngraduly lengthening and deminishing as they succeed each other.-\r\n\r\nThe small firn also rises with a common footstalk from the radix and\r\nare from four to eight in number. about 8 inches long; the central rib\r\nmarked with a slight longitudinal groove throughout it's whole length.\r\nthe leafets are oppositely pinnate about 1/3 rd of the length of the\r\ncommon footstalk from the bottom and thence alternately pinnate; the\r\nfootstalk terminating in a simple undivided nearly entire lanceolate\r\nleafet. the leafets are oblong, obtuse, convex absolutely entire,\r\nmarked on the upper disk with a slight longitudinal groove in place of\r\nthe central rib, smooth and of a deep green. near the upper extremity\r\nthese leafets are decursively pinnate as are also those of the large f\r\nrn. The grasses of this neighbourhood are generally coase harsh and\r\nsedge-like, and grow in large tufts. there is none except in the open\r\ngrounds. near the coast on the tops of some of the untimbered hills\r\nthere is a finer and softer species which resembles much the green\r\nswoard. the salt marshes also produce a coarse grass, Bull rushes and\r\nthe Cattail flagg. the two last the natives make great use in preparing\r\ntheir mats bags &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 13, 1806]\r\nTuesday February 13th 1806.\r\nThe Clatsop left us this morning at 11 A.M. not anything transpired\r\ndureing the day worthy of notice. yesterday we completed the opperation\r\nof drying the meat, and think we have a Sufficient Stock to last us\r\nthis month. the Indians inform us that we shall have great abundance of\r\nSmall fish in March. which from the discription must be the Herring.\r\nThose people have also informed us that one Moore who sometimes touches\r\nat this place and traded with the nativs of this Coast, had on board\r\nhis Ship 3 Cows, and that when he left them he continued his course\r\nalong the N W. Coast. I think this (if those Cows were not Coats)\r\nStrong circumstantial proof that their is a Settlement of white persons\r\nat Nootka Sound or Some place to the N W. of us on the coast.\r\n\r\nThere are also two Species of firn which are common to this Countrey\r\nbesides that before mentioned of which the nativs eate the roots. these\r\ntwo from their disparity in point of Size I shall distinguish the large\r\nand Small firn. both species continue green all winter\r\n\r\nThe large fern, rise to the hight of 3 or 4 feet, the Stem is a Common\r\nfootstalk or rib which proceeds imediately from the radix which is\r\nSomewhat flat on two Sides about the Size of a man's arm and covered\r\nwith innumerable black coarse capillary radicles which issue from every\r\npart of its surface; one of those roots or a collected bead of them\r\nwill Send forth from 20 to 40 of those Common footstalks all of which\r\ndecline or bend outwards from the Common center. those ribs are\r\ncylindric and marked longitudinally their whole length with a groove or\r\nchannel on their upper Side. on either Side of this groove a little\r\nbelow it's edge, the leafets are inserted, being partly petiolate for\r\nabout 2/3ds of the length of the middle rib, commenceing at the bottom\r\nand from thence to the extremity Sessile. the rib is termonated by a\r\nSingle undevided lanceolate gagged leafet. the leafets are lanceolate,\r\nfrom 2 to 4 inches in length gagged and have a Small accute angular\r\nprojection and obliquely cut at the base on either Side of the rib of\r\nthe leafet. upper Surface is Smooth and of a deep Green, the under disk\r\nof a pale Green and covered with a brown Substance of a woolly\r\nappearance particalarly near the center fiber or rib these leafets are\r\nalternately pointed they are in number from 110 to 140; shortest at the\r\ntwo extremities of the common footstalk and longest in the center,\r\ngradually lengthing and diminishing as they Suckceed each other\r\n\r\nThe Small firn also rises with a Common footstalk from the radix and\r\nare from 4 to 8 in number, about 8 inches long; the Central rib marked\r\nwith a Slight longitudinal Groove through out it's whole length. the\r\nleafets are oppositly pinnate about A of the length of the Common\r\nfootstalk from the bottom and thence alternately pinnate; the footstalk\r\ntermonating in a Simple undevided nearly entire lanceolate leafet. the\r\nleafets are oblong, obtuse, convex absolutely entire, marked on the\r\nupper disk with a Slight longitudinal grove in place of the central\r\nrib, smooth and of a deep green; near the upper extremity those lefets\r\nare decurscivily pinnate as are also those of the larg firn.\r\n\r\nThe Grass's of this neighbourhood are generally coarse harsh and Sedge\r\nlike, and grow in large tufts. there is none except in the open\r\ngrounds. near the Coast on the top of Some of the untimbered hills\r\nthere is a finer and Softer Species which resembles much the\r\nGreensword. the Salt marshes also produce a Corse grass, Bullrushes and\r\nthe Cattail flaggs. of the two last the nativs make great use in\r\nprepareing their mats bags &c. in those bags they Carry their fish\r\nBerries roots &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 14, 1806]\r\nFriday February 14th 1806.\r\nWe are very uneasy with rispect to our sick men at the salt works.\r\nSergt. Pryor and party have not yet returned nor can we conceive what\r\ncauses their delay. Drewyer visited his traps today and caught a very\r\nfine fat beaver on which we feasted this evening. on the 11th inst.\r\nCapt Clark completed a map of the country through which we have been\r\npassing from Fort Mandan to this place. in this map the Missouri\r\nJefferson's river the S. E. branch of the Columbia, Kooskooske and\r\nColumbia from the entrance of the S. E. fork to the pacific Ocean as\r\nwell as a part of Flathead river and our tract across the Rocky\r\nMountains are laid down by celestial observation and survey. the rivers\r\nare also connected at their sources with other rivers agreeably to the\r\ninformation of the natives and the most probable conjecture arrising\r\nfrom their capacities and the relative positions of their rispective\r\nentrances which last have with but few exceptions been established by\r\ncelestial observation. we now discover that we have found the most\r\npracticable and navigable passage across the Continent of North\r\nAmerica; it is that which we traveled with the exception of that part\r\nof our rout from the neighbourhood of the entrance of Dearborn's River\r\nuntill we arrived on Clarks river at the entrance of Traveler's rest\r\ncreek; the distance between those two points would be traveled more\r\nadvantageously by land as the navigation of the Missouri above the\r\nriver Dearborn is laborious and 420 miles distant by which no advantage\r\nis gained as the rout which we are compelled to travel by land from the\r\nsource of Jefferson's river to the entrance of Travelers rest Creek is\r\n220 miles being further by 500 miles than that from the entrance of\r\nDearborn's river to the last mentioned point and a much worse rout if\r\nIndian information is to be relyed on; from the same information the\r\nFlathead river like that of the S. E. fork of the Columbia which heads\r\nwith Jefferson's and Maddison's Rivers can not be navigated through the\r\nRocky Mountains in consequence of falls & rappids and as a confermation\r\nof this fact, we discovered that there were no salmon in the Flathead\r\nriver, which is the case in the S. E. branch of the Columbia although\r\nit is not navigable. added to this, the Indians further inform us, that\r\nthe Flathead river runs in the direction of the Rocky Mountains for a\r\ngreat distance to the North before it discharges itself into the\r\nColumbia river, which last from the same information from the entrance\r\nof the S. E. fork to that of Flathead river is obstructed with a great\r\nnumber of difficult and dangerous rappids. considering therefore the\r\ndanger and difficulties attending the navigation of the Columbia in\r\nthis part, as well as the circuitous and distant rout formed by itself\r\nand the Flathead river we conceive that even admitting the Flathead\r\nriver contrary to information to be as navigable as the Columbia river\r\nbelow it's entrance, that the tract by land over the Rocky Mountains\r\nusually traveled by the natives from the Entrance of Traveller's-rest\r\nCreek to the forks of the Kooskooske is preferable; the same being a\r\ndistance of 184 Miles. The inferrence therefore deduced from those\r\npremices are that the best and most Practicable rout across the\r\nContinent is by way of the Missouri to the entrance of Dearborn's river\r\nor near that place; from thence to flathead river at the entrance of\r\nTraveller's rest Creek, from thence up Traveller's rest creek to the\r\nforks, from whence you pursue a range of mounttains which divides the\r\nwaters of the two forks of this creek, and which still continuing it's\r\nWest wardly course divides the waters of the two forks of the\r\nKooskooske river to their junction; from thence to decend this river by\r\nwater to the S. E. branch of the Columbia, thence down that river to\r\nthe Columbia and with the latter to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 14, 1806]\r\nFriday February 14th 1806\r\nWe are very uneasy with respect to our Sick men at the Salt works.\r\nSerjt. Pryor and party haveing not yet returneded, nor can we conceive\r\nwhat can be the Cause of their delay. Drewyer visited his traps & to\r\nday and Cought a fine fat beaver on which we feasted this evening and\r\nthought it a great delecessey.-.\r\n\r\nI compleated a map of the Countrey through which we have been passing\r\nfrom the Mississippi at the Mouth of Missouri to this place. In the Map\r\nthe Missouri Jefferson's river the S. E. branch of the Columbia or\r\nLewis's river, Koos-koos-ke and Columbia from the enterance of the S. E\r\nfork to the pacific Ocian, as well as a part of Clark's river and our\r\ntrack across the Rocky Mountains are laid down by celestial\r\nobservations and Survey. the rivers are also conected at their Sources\r\nwith other rivers agreeably to the information of the nativs and the\r\nmost probable conjecture arrising from their capacities and the\r\nrelative positions of their respective enterances which last have with\r\nbut fiew exceptions been established by celestial observations. We now\r\ndiscover that we have found the most practicable and navigable passage\r\nacross the Continent of North America; it is that which we have\r\ntraveled with the exception of that part of our rout from the foot of\r\nthe Falls of the Missouri, or in neighbourhood of the enterance of the\r\nRocky Mountains untill we arive on Clarks river at the enterence of\r\nTravelers-rest Creek; the distance between those two points would be\r\ntraveled more advantagiously by land as the navigation of the Missouri\r\nabove the Falls is crooked laborious and 521 miles distant by which no\r\nadvantage is gained as the rout which we are compelled to travel by\r\nland from the Source of Jeffersons River to the enterance of Travellers\r\nrest Creek is 220 miles being further by At. 600 miles than that from\r\nthe Falls of the Missourie to the last mentioned point (Travellers rest\r\nCreek) and a much worse rout if indian information is to be relied on\r\nwhich is from the So so nee or Snake Indians, and the Flatheads of the\r\nColumbia west of the rocky mountains. from the Same information Clarks\r\nriver like that of the S. E. branch of the Columbia which heads with\r\nJefferson's and Maddisons river's can not be navagated thro the rocky\r\nmountains in consequence of falls and rapids, and as a confirmation of\r\nthe fact we discovered that there were no Salmon in Clark's river,\r\nwhich is not the Case in the S. E. branch of the Columbia altho it is\r\nnot navagable. added to this, the Indians of different quartes further\r\ninform us, that Clark's river runs in the direction of the Rocky\r\nMountains for a great distance to the north before it discharges itself\r\ninto the Columbia river---from the Same information the Columbia from\r\nthe enterance of the S. E. branch to the enterance of Clark's river is\r\nobstructed with a great number of dificuelt and dangerous rapids (and\r\nthe place Clark's river comes out of the Rocky mountains is a\r\ntremendious falls &c which there is no possibillity of passing the\r\nmountains either by land or water.) Considering therefore the dangers\r\nand deficuelties attending the navigation of the Columbia in this part,\r\nas well as the circuitous and distant rout formed by itself and that of\r\nClark's River we Conceive that even admitting that Clarks river\r\ncontrary to information to be as navagable as the Columbia below it's\r\nenterance, that the tract by land over the Rocky Mountains usially\r\ntraveled by the nativs from the enterance of Travellers rest Creek to\r\nthe Forks of the Kooskooske is preferable; the Same being a distance of\r\n184 miles. The inferrence therefore deduced from these premises are,\r\nthat the best and most practicable rout across the Continent is by way\r\nof the Missouri to the Great Falls; thence to Clarks river at the\r\nenterance of Travellers rest Creek, from thence up travillers rest\r\nCreek to the forks, from whence you prosue a range of mountains which\r\ndivides the waters of the two forks of this Creek, and which still\r\nContinues it's westwardly Course on the mountains which divides the\r\nwaters of the two forks of the Kooskooske river to their junction; from\r\nthence to decend this river to the S. E. branch of the Columbia, thence\r\ndown that river to the Columbia, and down the Latter to the Pacific\r\nOcian-. There is a large river which falls into the Columbia on its\r\nSouth Side at what point we could not lern; which passes thro those\r\nextencive Columbian Plains from the South East, and as the Indians\r\ninform us head in the mountains South of the head of Jeffersons River\r\nand at no great distance from the Spanish Settlements, and that that\r\nfork which heads with the River Rajhone and waters of the Missouri\r\npasses through those extensive plains in which there is no wood, and\r\nthe river Crowded with rapids & falls many of which are impassable. the\r\nother or westerly fork passes near a range of mountains and is the fork\r\nwhich great numbers of Indian Bands of the So sone or Snake Indians,\r\nthis fork most probably heads with North River or the waters of\r\nCallifornia. This River may afford a practicable land Communication\r\nwith New Mexico by means of its western fork. This river cannot be\r\nnavagable as an unpracticable rapid is within one mile of its enterance\r\ninto the Columbia, and we are fully purswaded that a rout by this river\r\nif practicable at all, would lengthen the distance greatly and\r\nincounter the Same dificuelties in passing the Rocky Mountains with the\r\nrout by way of Travellers rest Creek & Clarks river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 15, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 15th 1806.\r\nDrewyer and Whitehouse set out this morning on a hunting excurtion\r\ntowards the praries of Point Adams. we have heard our hunters over the\r\nNetul fire several shot today, but have had no account from them as\r\nyet. about 3 P.M. Bratton arrived from the salt works and informed us\r\nthat Sergt. Pryor and party were on their way with Gibson who is so\r\nmuch reduced that he cannot stand alone and that they are obliged to\r\ncarry him in a litter. Bratton himself appears much reduced with his\r\nlate indisposition but is now recovering fast. Bratton informed that\r\nthe cause of Sergt. Pryor's delay was attributeable to the winds which\r\nhad been so violent for several days as to render it impossible to get\r\na canoe up the creek to the point where it was necessary to pass with\r\nGibson. the S. W. winds are frequently very violent on the coast when\r\nwe are but little sensible of them at Fort Clatsop. in consequence of\r\nthe lofty and thickly timbered fir country which surrounds us on that\r\nquarter from the South to the North East.\r\n\r\nafter dark Sergt. Pryor arrived with Gibson. we are much pleased in\r\nfinding him by no means as ill as we had expected. we do no conceive\r\nhim in danger by any means, tho he has yet a fever and is much reduced.\r\nwe beleive his disorder to have orriginated in a violent cold which he\r\ncontracted in hunting and pursuing Elk and other game through the swams\r\nand marshes about the salt works. he is nearly free from pain tho a\r\ngooddeel reduced and very languid. we gave him broken dozes of diluted\r\nnitre and made him drink plentifully of sage tea, had his feet bathed\r\nin warm water and at 9 P.M. gave him 35 drops of laudanum.\r\n\r\nThe quadrupeds of this country from the Rocky Mountains to the pacific\r\nOcean are 1st the domestic animals, consisting of the horse and the dog\r\nonly; 2cdly the native wild animals, consisting of the Brown white or\r\ngrizly bear, (which I beleive to be the same family with a mearly\r\naccedental difference in point of colour) the black bear, the common\r\nred deer, the black tailed fallow deer, the Mule deer, Elk, the large\r\nbrown wolf, the small woolf of the plains, the large wolf of the\r\nplains, the tiger cat, the common red fox, black fox or fisher, silver\r\nfox, large red fox of the plains, small fox of the plains or kit fox,\r\nAntelope, sheep, beaver, common otter, sea Otter, mink, spuck, seal,\r\nracoon, large grey squirrel, small brown squirrel, small grey squirrel,\r\nground squirrel, sewelel, Braro, rat, mouse, mole, Panther, hare,\r\nrabbit, and polecat or skunk. all of which shall be severally noticed\r\nin the order in which they occur as well as shuch others as I learn do\r\nexist and which not been here recapitulated. The horse is confined\r\nprincipally to the nations inhabiting the great plains of Columbia\r\nextending from Latitude 40° to 50° N. and occuping the tract of country\r\nlying between the rocky mountains and a range of Mountains which pass\r\nthe columbia river about the great falls or from Longitude 116 to 121\r\nWest. in this extesive tract of principally untimbered country so far\r\nas we have leant the following nations reside (viz) the Sosone or snake\r\nIndians, the Chopunnish, sokulks, Cutssahnims, Chymnapums, Ehelutes,\r\nEneshuh & Chilluckkittequaws. all of whom enjoy the bennefit of that\r\ndocile, generous and valuable anamal the horse, and all of them except\r\nthe three last have immence numbers of them. Their horses appear to be\r\nof an excellent race; they are lofty eligantly formed active and\r\ndurable; in short many of them look like the fine English coarsers and\r\nwould make a figure in any country. some of those horses are pided with\r\nlarge spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with the\r\nblack brown bey or some other dark colour, but much the larger portion\r\nare of an uniform colour with stars snips and white feet, or in this\r\nrispect marked much like our best blooded horses in virginia, which\r\nthey resemble as well in fleetness and bottom as in form and colours.\r\nthe natives suffer them to run at large in the plains, the grass of\r\nwhich furnishes them with their only subsistence their masters taking\r\nno trouble to lay in a winters store for them, but they even keep fat\r\nif not much used on the dry grass of the plains during the winter. no\r\nrain scarcely ever falls in these plains and the grass is short and but\r\nthin. The natives appear to take no pains in scelecting their male\r\nhorses from which they breed, in short those of that discription which\r\nI have noticed appeared much the most indifferent. whether the horse\r\nwas orrigeonally a native of this country or not it is out of my power\r\nto determine as we can not understand the language of the natives\r\nsufficiently to ask the question. at all events the country and climate\r\nappears well adapted to this anamal. horses are said to be found wild\r\nin many parts of this extensive plain country. the several tribes of\r\nSosones who reside towards Mexico on the waters of Clark's river or\r\nparticularly one of them called Sh&-bo-bo-ah have also a great number\r\nof mules, which among the Indians I find are much more highly prized\r\nthan horses. an eligant horse may be purchased of the natives in this\r\ncountry for a lew peads or other paltry trinkets which in the U States\r\nwould not cost more than one or two dollars. This abundance and\r\ncheapness of horses will be extremely advantageous to those who may\r\nhereafter attemt the fir trade to the East Indies by way of the\r\nColumbia river and the Pacific Ocean.--the mules in the possession of\r\nthe Indians are principally stolen from the Spaniards of Mexeco; they\r\nappear to be large and fine such as we have seen. Among the Sosones of\r\nthe upper part of the S. E. fork of the Columbia we saw several horses\r\nwith spanish brands on them which we supposed had been stolen from the\r\ninhabitants of Mexeco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 15, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 15th 1806\r\nDrewyer and Whitehouse Set out on a hunting excurtion towards the\r\nmountains Southwest of us. we have heard our hunters over the Netul\r\nfire Several Shot today, but have had no account of them as yet. 3 P.M.\r\nBratten arived from the Saltworks, and informed us that Serjt. Pryor\r\nand party were on their way with gibson in a litter. he is verry bad\r\nand much reduced with his present indisposition. Wm. Bratten appears\r\nmuch reduced, and is yet verry unwell. he informs that the Cause of\r\nSergt.

Pryor arrived with\r\nGibson. we are much pleased in findeing him by no means as ill as we\r\nhad expected. we do not conceive him in danger by any means, tho he has\r\nyet a fever and is much reduced. we believe his disorder to have\r\noriginated in a violent Cold which he contracted in hunting and\r\nprosueing Elk and other game through the Swamps and marshes about the\r\nsalt works. he is nearly free from pain tho a good deel reduced and\r\nvery languid. we gave him double doses of diluted niter and made him\r\ndrink plentifully of Sage tea, had his feat bathed in worm water and at\r\n9 P.M. gave him 35 drops of laudanum.\r\n\r\nThe quadrupeds of this countrey from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\r\nOcian are first the Domestic Animals, consisting of the Horses and Dogs\r\nonly; 2ndly the Native Wild Animals, consisting of the White, brown, or\r\nGrizly bear (which I believe to be the same family with a mearly\r\naccidentail difference in point of Colour) The Black Bear, the Elk, the\r\nCommon red Deer, the Mule deer, the black tailed fallow Deer, the large\r\nbrown wolf, the Small wolf of the Plains, the large wolf of the Plains,\r\nPanther, the tiger cat, the common red fox, the black fox or fisher,\r\nthe Silver fox, large red fox of the plains, Small fox of the plains or\r\nkit fox, Antelope, Sheep, beaver, Common Otter, Sea Otter, minks, Seals\r\nracoons, large Grey Squerrel, Small brown Squirrel, Small grey\r\nSquirrel, Ground Squirrel, Sewelel, Braro, rat, mouse, mole, hare,\r\nrabbet, and pole Cat or Skunk. all of which Shall be Severally noticed\r\nin the order in which they occur as well as Such others as I learn do\r\nexist, and which not been here recapitulated.\r\n\r\nThe Horse is principally Confined to the Nations inhabiting the great\r\nPlains of Columbia extending from Latitude 40° to 50° N. and occupying the\r\ntract of Countrey lying between the Rocky Mountains and a rang of\r\nmountains which pass the Columbia River about the Great Falls or from\r\nLongitude 116° to 121° West in this extensive tract of Principally\r\nuntimbered countrey So far as we have lernt the following nations\r\nreside (viz) The Sosone, or Snake Indians inhabiting the South fork or\r\n____ River, the Chopunnish, Sokulk's, Cutssahnims, Chym na pum,\r\nEhelutes, Eneshuh & Chilluckkittequaws. all of whome enjoy the benifit\r\nof that docile generous and valueable Animal the Horse, and all of them\r\nexcept the three last have emence numbers of them. their horses appear\r\nto be of an excellent race; they are lofty eligantly formed active and\r\ndurable; in Short maney of them look like the fine English coursers and\r\nwould make a figure in any country. Some of those horses in pided with\r\nlarge spots of white irrigularly scattered and intermixed with black,\r\nbrown, Bey or Some other dark colour, but much the larger portion are\r\nof a uniform Colour with Stars, snips, and white feet, or in this\r\nrespect marked much like our best blooded horses in the U, States,\r\nwhich they resemble as well in fleetness and bottom as in form and\r\nColour. the nativs Suffer them to run at large in the plains, the Grass\r\nof which furnish them with their only Subsistance, their owners takeing\r\nno trouble to lay in a winters Store for them, but they keep fat if not\r\nmuch used on the dry grass of the plains dureing the winter. rain\r\nscercely ever falls in those plains and the Grass is Short and but\r\nthin. the nativs appear to take no pains in Selecting their male horses\r\nfrom which they bread, in Short those of that discription which I have\r\nnoticed appear much the most indifferent. whether the horses was\r\noriginally a native of this Country or not, it is out of my power to\r\ndetermine as we cannot understand the language of the nativs\r\nSufficiently to ask the question. at all events the Country and Climate\r\nappears well adapted to this Animal.

Shannon an Labiesh brought\r\nin to us to day a Buzzard or Vulture of the Columbia which they had\r\nwounded and taken alive. I believe this to be the largest Bird of North\r\nAmerica. it was not in good order and yet it wayed 25 lbs had it have\r\nbeen so it might very well have weighed 10 lbs. more or 35 lbs. between\r\nthe extremities of the wings it measured 9 feet 2 Inches; from the\r\nextremity of the beak to that of the toe 3 feet 9 inches and a half.\r\nfrom hip to toe 2 feet, girth of the head 9 inches 3/4. Girth of the\r\nneck 71/2 inches; Girth of the body exclusive of the wings 2 feet 3\r\ninches; girth of the leg 3 inches. the diameter of the eye 41/2 10ths\r\nof an inch, the iris of a pale scarlet red, the puple of a deep Sea\r\ngreen or black and occupies about one third of the diameter of the eye\r\nthe head and part of the neck as low as the figures 12 is uncovered\r\nwith feathers except that portion of it represented by dots foward and\r\nunder the eye. (See likeness on the other Side of this leaf) the tail\r\nis Composed of twelve feathers of equal length, each 14 inches. the\r\nlegs are 43/4 inches in length and of a whitefish colour uncovered with\r\nfeathers, they are not entirely Smooth but not imbricated; the toes are\r\nfour in number three of which are foward and that in the center much\r\nthe longest; the fourth is Short and is inserted near the inner of the\r\nthree other toes and reather projecting foward. the thye is covered\r\nwith feathers as low as the Knee. the top or upper part of the toes are\r\nimbricated with broad scales lying transversly; the nails are black and\r\nin proportion to the Size of the bird comparitively with those of the\r\nHawk or Eagle, Short and bluntly pointed---the under Side of the wing\r\nis Covered with white down and feathers. a white Stripe of about 2\r\ninches in width, also marks the outer part of the wing, imbraceing the\r\nlower points of the feathers, which cover the joints of the wing\r\nthrough their whole length or width of that part of the wing. all the\r\nother feathers of whatever part are of a Glossy Shineing black except\r\nthe down, which is not glossy, but equally black. the Skin of the beak\r\nand head to the joining of the neck is of a pale orrange Yellow, the\r\nother part uncovered with feathers is of a light flesh Colour. the Skin\r\nis thin and wrinkled except on the beak where it is Smooth. This bird\r\nfly's very clumsily. nor do I know whether it ever Seizes it's prey\r\nalive, but am induced to believe it does not. we have Seen it feeding\r\non the remains of the whale and other fish which have been thrown up by\r\nthe waves on the Sea Coast. these I believe constitute their principal\r\nfood, but I have no doubt but that they also feed on flesh. we did not\r\nmeet with this bird untille we had decended the Columbia below the\r\ngreat falls; and have found them more abundant below tide water than\r\nabove. this is the Same Species of Bird which R. Field killed on the\r\n18th of Novr. last and which is noticed on that day tho not fully\r\ndiscribed then I thought this of the Buzzard Specis. I now believe that\r\nthis bird is reather of the Vulture genus than any other, tho it wants\r\nSome of their characteristics particularly the hair on the neck, and\r\nthe feathers on the legs. this is a handsom bird at a little distance.\r\nit's neck is proportionably longer than those of the Hawks or Eagle.\r\nShannon also brought a Grey Eagle which appeared to be of the Same kind\r\ncommon to the U, States. it weighed 15 pds. and measured 7 feet 7\r\ninches between the extremities of the wings\r\n\r\nShannon and Labiesh informed us that when he approached this Vulture\r\nafter wounding it, that it made a loud noise very much like the barking\r\nof a Dog. the tongue is long firm and broad, filling the under Chap and\r\npartakeing of its transvirs curvature, or its Sides forming a\r\nlongitudinal Groove; obtuse at the point, the margin armed with firm\r\ncartelagenous prickkles pointed and bending inwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 17, 1806]\r\nMonday February 17th 1806.\r\nCollins and Windsor were permited to hunt today towards the praries in\r\nPoint Adams with a view to obtain some fresh meat for the sick. a\r\nlittle before noon Shannon LaBuishe & Frazier returned with the flesh\r\nand hide of an Elk which had been wouded by Sergt. Gass's party and\r\ntook the water where they pursued it and caught it. they did not see\r\nSergt. Gass or any of his party nor learn what further success they had\r\nhad. continue the barks with Bratton, and commenced them with Gibson\r\nhis fever being sufficiently low this morning to permit the uce of\r\nthem. I think therefore that there is no further danger of his\r\nrecovery.--at 2 P.M. Joseph Fields arrived from the Salt works and\r\ninformed us that they had about 2 Kegs of salt on hand which with what\r\nwe have at this place we suppose will be sufficient to last us to our\r\ndeposits of that article on the Missouri. we there directed a party of\r\nsix men to go with Fields in the morning in order to bring the salt and\r\nkettles to the fort. Shannon brought me one of the large carrion Crow\r\nor Buzzads of the Columbia which they had wounded and taken alive. I\r\nbleive this to be the largest bird of North America. it was not in good\r\norder and yet it weighed 25 lbs. had it have been so it might very well\r\nhave weighed 10 lbs mor or 35 lbs. between the extremities of the wings\r\nit measured 9 feet 2 inches; from the extremity of the beak to that of\r\nthe toe 3 F. 91/2 In. from hip to toe 2 feet, girth of head 93/4 In.\r\ngirth of the neck 71/2 Inches; do. of body exclusive of the wings 2\r\nfeet 3 Inches; do of leg 3 inches. diameter of the eye 41/2/toths of an\r\ninch. the iris of a pale scarlet red, the puple of deep sea green or\r\nblack and occupyed about one third of the diameter of the eye. the head\r\nand a part of the neck as low as the figures 12 is uncovered with\r\nfeathers except that portion of it represented by dots (see likeness).\r\nthe tail is composed of 12 feathers of equal length, each 14 inches.\r\nthe legs are 43/4 inches in length and of a white colour un covered\r\nwith feathers, they are not entirely smooth but not imbricated; the\r\ntoes are four in number three of which are forward and that in the\r\ncenter much the longes; the fourth is short and is inserted near the\r\ninner of the three other toes and reather projecting forward. the thye\r\nis covered with feathers as low as the knee. the top or upper part of\r\nthe toes are imbricated with broad scales lying transversly; the nails\r\nare blak and in proportion to the size of the bird comparitively with\r\nthose of the halk or Eagle, short and bluntly pointed. the under side\r\nof the wing is covered with white down and feathers. a white stripe of\r\nabout two inches in width, also marks the outer part of the wing,\r\nimbracing the lower points of the feathers, which cover the joints of\r\nthe wing through their whole length or width of that part of the wing.\r\nall the other feathers of whatever part are glossey shining black\r\nexcept the down which is not glossey but equally black. the skin of the\r\nbeak and head to the joining of the neck is of a pale orrange yellow\r\nthe other part uncovered with feathers is of a light flesh colour. the\r\nskin is thin and wrinkled except on the beak where it is smooth. this\r\nbird flys very clumsily nor do I know whether it ever seizes it's prey\r\nalive, but am induced to beleive that it dose not. we have seen it\r\nfeeding on the remains of the whale & other fish which have been thrown\r\nup by the waves on the sea coast. these I beleive constitute their\r\nprinsipal food, but I have no doubt but they also feed on flesh; we did\r\nnot met with this bird untill we had decended the Columbia below the\r\ngreat falls, and have found them more abundant below tide-water than\r\nabove. I beleive that this bird is reather of the Vulture genus than\r\nany other, tho it wants some of their charactaristics particularly the\r\nhair on the neck and feathers on the legs.--this is a handsome bird at\r\na little distance. it's neck is proportionably longer than those of the\r\nhawks or Eagle. Shannon also brought me a grey Eagle which appeared to\r\nbe of the same kind common to the U States; it weighed 15 lb. and\r\nmeasured 7 Feet 7 Inches between the extremities of the wings.--At 4\r\nP.M. Sergt. Gass and party arrived; they had killed eight Elk. Drewyer\r\nand Whitehouse also returned late in the evening, had killed one Elk.-\r\nLabuishe informed me that when he approached this vulture, after\r\nwounding it, that it made a loud noise very much like the barking of a\r\ndog & the tongue is large firm and broad, filling the under chap and\r\npartaking of it's transverse curvature, or it's sides colapsing upwards\r\nforming a longitudinal groove; obtuse at the point, the margin armed\r\nwith firm cartelaginous prickkles pointed and bending inwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 17, 1806]\r\nMonday February 17th 1806\r\nCollins and Windser were permited to hunt to day towards the praries in\r\npoint Adams with a view to obtain Some fresh meat for the Sick. a\r\nlittle before noon Shannon and Labiesh & frazier Came with the flesh\r\nand hide of an Elk which had been wounded by Serjt. Gasses party and\r\ntook the water where they pursued it and cought it. they did not See\r\nSergt. Gass or any of his party or learn what further Sucksess they\r\nhave had. Continu the barks with Bratten, and Commenced them with\r\ngibson his feaver being Sufficiently low this morning to permit the use\r\nof them. I think therefore that there is no further danger of his\r\nrecovery.---at 2 P.M. Joseph Field arrived from the Salt works and\r\ninformd us that they had about 2 Kegs of Salt on hand (say 3 bushels)\r\nwhich with what we have at this place we suppose will be Sufficient to\r\nlast us to our deposit of that article on the Missouri. we directed a\r\nparty of Six men to go in the morning in order to bring the salt and\r\nKittles to the Fort. at 4 P.M. Serjt. Gass and party arrive; they had\r\nkilled 8 Elk. Drewyer and Whitehouse also return late in the evening,\r\nthey had killed one Elk, part of the meat of which they brought in with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Brown, White, or Grizly Bear are found in the rocky mountains in\r\nthe timbered part of it or Westerly Side but rarely; they are more\r\nCommon below or on the East Side of the Rocky Mountains on the borders\r\nof the plains where there are Copses of bushes and underwood near the\r\nwater cources. they are by no means as plenty on this Side of the Rocky\r\nMountains as on the other, nor do I believe they are found at all in\r\nthe woody country which borders this coast as far in the interior as\r\nthe range of mountains which pass the Columbia between the enterance of\r\nClarks and the Quick sand Rivers or below the Great falls of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe Black Bear differs not any from those Common to the U. States, and\r\nare found under the Rocky Mountains in the woody country on the borders\r\nof the Great Plain's of Columbia and also in this tract of woody\r\ncountry which lie between these plains and the Pacific Ocian. their\r\neconimy and habits are also the Same with those of the United States.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 18, 1806]\r\nTuesday February 18th 1806.\r\nThis morning we dispatched a party to the Saltworks with Sergt.

Ordway returned and reported that the waves ran so\r\nhigh in the bay that he could not pass to the entrance of the creek\r\nwhich we had directed him to assend with the canoe. Collins and Winsor\r\nreturned this evening with one deer which they had killed. the deer are\r\npoor and their flesh by no means as good as that of the Elk which is\r\nalso poor but appears to be geting better than some weeks past.--in the\r\nforenoon we were visited by eight Clasops and Chinnooks from whom we\r\npurchased a Sea Otter's skin and two hats made of waytape and white\r\nceder bark. they remained untill late in the evening and departed for\r\ntheir village. these people are not readily obstructed by waves in\r\ntheir canoes.--Sergt. Ordway brought me a specemine of a species of\r\npine peculiar to the swamps and marshes frequently overflown by the\r\ntide as this is a distinct species I shall call it No. 7. this tree\r\nseldom rises to a greater hight than 35 feet and is from 21/2 to 4 feet\r\nin diameter; the stem is simple branching diffuse and proliferous. the\r\nbark the same with that of No. 1 only reather more rugged. the leaf is\r\nacerose, 2/10ths of an inch in width and 3/4 in length. they are firm\r\nstif and somewhat accuminated, ending in a short pointed hard tendril,\r\ngibbous, thickly scattered on all sides of the bough but rispect the\r\nthree upper sides only. those which have there insersion on the\r\nunderside incline sidewise with their points upwards giving the leaf\r\nthe figure of a sythe. the others are perpendicular or pointing\r\nupwards. is sessile growing as in No. 1 from small triangular pedestals\r\nof a soft spungy elastic bark. the under disk of these leaves or that\r\nwhich grows nearest towards the base of the bough is a deep glossey\r\ngreen while the upper or opposite side is of a mealy whiteish pale\r\ngreen; in this rispect differing from almost all leaves. the boughs\r\nretain their leaves as far back as to the sixth years growth. the\r\npeculiarity of the bud scales observed in No 1 is observed in this\r\nspecies. The cone is 31/2 inches in length and 3 in circumpherence, of\r\nan ovate figure being thickest in the middle and tapering and\r\nterminating in two obtuse points. it is composes of small, flexible,\r\nthin, obtusely pointed smooth and redish brown imbricated scales. each\r\nscale covering two small winged seeds and being itself covered in the\r\ncenter by a small thin inferior scale accutely pointed. the cone is\r\nsomewhat of this figure. they proceede from the side as well as the\r\nextremities of the bough but in the former case always at or near the\r\ncommencement of some one years growth which is some instances are as\r\nfar back as the third year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 18, 1806]\r\nTuesday February 18th 1806\r\nThis morning we dispatched a party to the Salt works with Sergt.\r\nOrdway. and a Second party with Sergt. Gass after the Eight Elk killed\r\nover the Netul. in the evening Sergt. Ordway returned and reported that\r\nthe waves ran So high in the Bay that he could not pass to the\r\nenterance of a Creek which we had directed him to assend with the\r\nCanoe. Collins & Windsir returned this evening with one Deer which they\r\nhad Killed. the deer are pore and their flesh by no means as good as\r\nthat of the Elk which is also poore but appears to be getting better\r\nthan Some weeks past. in the forenoon we were visited by a Clatsop &\r\nSeven Chinnooks from whome I purchased a Sea otter's Skin and two hats\r\nmade of way tape and Silk grass and white cedar bark. they remained\r\nuntill late in the evening and departed for their village. those people\r\nare not readily obstructed by waves in their Canoes. Since their\r\ndeparture we have discovered that they have Stole an ax.--Whitehouse\r\nbrought me a roab which he purchased of the Indians formed of three\r\nSkins of the Tiger Cat, this Cat differs from any which I have ever\r\nSeen. it is found on the borders of the plains and the woody Country\r\nlying along the Pacific Ocian. this animale is about the Size or\r\nreather larger than the wild Cat of our Countrey and is much the Same\r\nin form, agility and ferosity. the colour of the back, neck and Sides,\r\nis a redish brown irrigular varigated with Small Spots of dark brown\r\nthe tail is about two inches long nearly white except the extremity\r\nwhich is black; it termonates abruptly as if it had been cut off. the\r\nbelly is white with Small black spots. butifully varigated. the legs\r\nare of the Same Colour with the Sides and back marked with transvers\r\nstripes of black the ears are black on the outer Side Covered with fine\r\nblack hair, Short except at the upper point which is furnished with a\r\npencil of verry fine Streight black hair, 3/4 of an inch in length, the\r\nfur of this animale is long and fine. much more So than the wild Cat of\r\nthe U States but less so than the Louserva of the N West. the nativs of\r\nthis Country make great use of the skins of this Cat, to form the robes\r\nwhich they wear; three whole Skins is the complement usually employed,\r\nand Sometimes four in each roab. Those Cats are not marked alike maney\r\nof them have but fiew Spots of a darker Colour, particularly on the\r\nBack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 19, 1806]\r\nWednesday February 19th 1806.\r\nSergt. Ordway set out again this morning with a party for the salt\r\nworks by land. in the evening Sergt. Gass returned with the flesh of\r\neight Elk, and seven skins; having left one skin with Shannon and\r\nLabuishe who remained over the netul to continue the chase. we had the\r\nElk skins divided among the messes in order that they might be prepared\r\nfor covering our baggage when we set out in the spring. our sick are\r\nrecovering but they appear to strengthen but slowly. The common red\r\ndeer we found under the rocky mts. in the neighbourhood of the\r\nChopunnish, and about the great falls of the Columbia river and as low\r\ndown the same as the commencement of tide water. these do not appear to\r\ndiffer essentially from those of our country being about the same size\r\nshape and appearance in every rispect except their great length of tail\r\nwhich is more than half as long again as our deer I measured one of\r\nthem which was 17 inches long. The Black tailed fallow deer are\r\npeculiar to this coast and are a distinct species of deer partaking\r\nequally of peculiarities of the mule deer and the common deer. their\r\nears are reather larger and their winter coat darker than the common\r\ndeer; the recepticle of the eye or drane is mor conspicuous; their legs\r\nshorter and body thicker and larger than the common deer; their tail is\r\nabout the length of our deer or from 8 to 10 inches the hair on the\r\nunderside of which is white, and that of it's sides and top quite black\r\nthe horns resemble in form and colour those of the mule deer which it\r\nalso resembles in it's gate; that is bounding with all four feet off\r\nthe ground at the same time when runing at full speed and not loping as\r\nthe common deer or antelope do. they are sometimes found in the\r\nwoodlands but most frequently in the praries and open grounds. they may\r\nbe said generally to be a size larger than the common deer and that\r\nless than the mule deer. they are very seldom found in good order, or\r\nfat, even in the season which the common deer are so, and their flesh\r\nis inferior to any species of deer which I have ever seen.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 19, 1806]\r\nWednesday February 19th 1806.\r\nSergt.

Gass returned with the flesh of Eight Elk, and Seven\r\nSkins haveing left one Skin with Shannon and Labiche who remained over\r\nthe Netul to Continue the chase. we devided the Skins between the\r\nmesses in order that they might be prepared for Covering the baggage\r\nwhen we Set out in the Spring. our Sick appear to Strengthen but Slowly\r\nI gave Bratten 6 of Scotts pills which did not work him. he is very\r\nweak and Complains of his back.\r\n\r\nThe black Fox or as they are more frequently Called by the N West\r\nTrader Fisher is found in the woody country on this Coast. how this\r\nAnimal obtained the name of fisher I know not, but certain it is, that\r\nthe name is not appropriate, as it does not prey on or Seek it as a\r\nprey-. they are extreeinly active Strong and made for climbing which\r\nthey do with great agility, and bound from tree to tree in pursute of\r\nthe squirel or Rackoon, their natural and most usual food. their Colour\r\nis a jut Black except a Small Spot of white on the breast. the body is\r\nlong, legs Short and formed Something like the turnspit Dog, with a\r\nremarkable long tail. it does not differ here from those of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Fox this animale is very rare even in the Countrey where it\r\nexists, I have never Seen more than the Skins of this Animal and those\r\nwere in the possession of the nativs of the woody Country below the\r\nGreat falls of the Columbia, from which I think it is most probably\r\nthey are the inhabitants of the woody country exclusively. from the\r\nSkins, it appeard to be about the Size of the large red Fox of the\r\nplains and much of its form with a large tail. the legs I think\r\nsomewhat longer it has a fine long deep fur poil. the poil is of a dark\r\nlead colour and the long hairs intermixed with it, are either white or\r\nblack at the lower part, and white at top, the whole mixture forming a\r\nbutifull Silver Grey. I think this the handsomest of all the Fox\r\nSpecies, except a Species of which I Saw one running, and Capt Lewis\r\nhad a good view of another of the Same Species on the Missouri near the\r\nnatural walls. The large red fox of the plains, and the Kit fox are the\r\nSame which we met with on the Missouri and are the inhabitants almost\r\nexclusively of the open plains, or of the copse of bushes within the\r\nplain country. the Common red or grey fox of the United States is also\r\nfound in the woody country on this coast, nor does it appear to be\r\naltered in respect to it's fur colour or any other particular. we have\r\nSeen none of the large red fox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 20, 1806]\r\nThursday February 20th 1806.\r\nPermited Collins to hunt this morning he returned in the evening\r\nunsuccessfull as to the chase but brought with him some cranberries for\r\nthe sick.

Gibson still continues the barks three times a\r\nday and is on the recovery fast.-\r\n\r\nThe tyger Cat is found on the borders of the plains and in the woody\r\ncountry lying along the Pacific Ocean. this animal is about the size or\r\nreather larger than the wild cat of our country and is much the same in\r\nform, agility and ferosity. the colour of the back neck and sides is a\r\nredish brown irregularly variegated with small spots of dark brown the\r\ntail is about two inches long nearly white except the extremity which\r\nis black; it terminates abruptly as if it had been cut off. the belly\r\nis white with small black spots, beautifully variagated. the legs are\r\nof the same colour with the sides and back marked with transverse\r\nstripes of black the ears are black on the outer side covered with fine\r\nshort hair except at the upper point which furnished with a pensil of\r\nfine, streight, black hair, = 3/4 of an inch in length. the fur of this\r\nanamal is long and fine, much more so than the wild cat of the United\r\nStates but less so than that of Louservea of the N. West. the natives\r\nin this quarter make great use of the skins of this Cat to form the\r\nrobes which they wear; four skins is the compliment usuly employed in\r\neach robe. the Black fox, or as they most frequently called in the\r\nneighbourhood of Detroit, Fisher is found in the woody country on this\r\ncoast. how this animal obtained the name of fisher I know not, but\r\ncertain it is, that the name is not appropriate, as it dose not prey on\r\nfish or seek it as a prey. they are extreemly active strong and\r\nprepared for climbing, which they do with great agility, and bound from\r\ntree to tree in pursuit of the squirrel or Rackoon their natural and\r\nmost usual food. their colour is a jut black except a small spot of\r\nwhite on the breast. the body is long, legs short and formed something\r\nlike the ternspit dog with a remarkable long tail. it dose not differ\r\nhere from those of the United States. The Silver fox this animal is\r\nvery rare even in the country where it exists; I have never seen more\r\nthan the Skins of this anamal and those were in the possession of the\r\nnatives of the woody Country below the great falls of the Columbia from\r\nwhich I think that it is most probably the inhabtant of the woody\r\ncountry exclusively. from the skin it appeared to be about the size of\r\nthe large red fox of the plains and much of it's form with a large\r\ntail. the legs I think somewhat longer. it has a fine long deep fur\r\npoll. the poil is of a dark lead colour and the long hairs intermixed\r\nwith it are either white or black at the lower part and white at the\r\ntop, the whole mixture forming a beatifull silver grey. I think this\r\nthe most beautifull of all the Foxes except species of which I saw one\r\nonly on the Missouri near the natural walls. the large red fox of the\r\nplains and the Kit fox are the same which we met with on the Missouri\r\nand are the inhabitants almost exclusively of the open plains, or of\r\nthe cops of brush within the pain country. The common red fox of the\r\nUnited States is also found in the woody country on this coast nor dose\r\nit appear to be altered in rispect to it's fur colour or any other\r\nparticular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 21, 1806]\r\nFriday February 21st 1806\r\nVisited this morning by three Clatsops, who remained with us all day;\r\nthey are great begers; Capt Lewis gave one of them a fiew nedles with\r\nwhich he appeared much gratified, in the evening late they departed.\r\n\r\nDrewyer and Collins went in pursute of Some Elk the tracks of which\r\nCollins had discovered yesterday; but it rained So hard they Could not\r\npursue them by the tracks, and returned unsucksessfull.

Gibson Still Continus the bark 3 times a day and\r\nis on the recovery fast.\r\n\r\nThe large brown Wolf is like that of the atlantic States, and are found\r\nonly in the woody Country on the Pacific Ocean embraceing the mountains\r\nwhich pass the Columbia between the Great Falls an Rapids of the same.\r\nThe large and Small Wolves of the inhabitents principally of the open\r\nCountry and the wood land on their borders, and resemble in their\r\nhabits those of the plains of Missouri presisely they are not abundant\r\nin the Plains of Columbia because there is but little game on which for\r\nthem to subsist-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 22, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 22cd 1806.\r\nWe were visited today by two Clatsop women and two boys who brought a\r\nparsel of excellent hats made of Cedar bark and ornamented with\r\nbeargrass. two of these hats had been made by measures which Capt Clark\r\nand myself had given one of the women some time since with a request to\r\nmake each of us a hat; they fit us very well, and are in the form we\r\ndesired them. we purchased all their hats and distributed them among\r\nthe party. the woodwork and sculpture of these people as well as these\r\nhats and their waterproof baskets evince an ingenuity by no means\r\ncommon among the Aborigenes of America. in the evening they returned to\r\ntheir village and Drewyer accompanied them in their canoe in order to\r\nget the dogs which the Clatsops have agreed to give us in payment for\r\nthe Elk they stole from us some weeks since. these women informed us\r\nthat the small fish began to run which we suppose to be herring from\r\ntheir discription. they also informed us that their Chief, Coma or\r\nComowooll, had gone up the Columbia to the valley in order to purchase\r\nwappetoe, a part of which he in tended trading with us on his return.\r\none of our canoes brake the cord by which it was attatched and was\r\ngoing off with the tide this evening; we sent Sergt. Pryor and a party\r\nafter her who recovered and brought her back. our sick consisting of\r\nGibson, Bratton, Sergt. Ordway, Willard and McNeal are all on the\r\nrecovery. we have not had as may sick at any one time since we left\r\nWood River. the general complaint seams to be bad colds and fevers,\r\nsomething I beleive of the influenza.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope is found in the great plains of Columbia and are the same\r\nof those on the Missouri found in every part of that untimbered\r\ncountry. they are by no means as plenty on this side of the Rocky\r\nMountains as on the other. the natives here make robes of their skins\r\ndressed with the hair on them. when the salmon begin to decline in the\r\nlatter end of the sunme and Autumn the natves leave the river, at least\r\na majority and remove to the plains at some distance for the purpose of\r\nhunting the Antelope. they pursue them on horse back and shoot them\r\nwith their arrows. The sheep is found in various parts of the Rocky\r\nmountains, but most commonly in those parts which are timbered and\r\nsteep. they are also found in greater abundance on the Chain of\r\nmountains with form the commencement of the woody country on this coast\r\nand which pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids we have\r\nnever met with this anamal ourselves but have seen many of their skins\r\nin possession of the natives dressed with the wooll on them and aso\r\nseen the blankets which they manufacture of the wooll of this sheep.\r\nfrom the skin the animal appears to be about the size of the common\r\nsheep; of a white colour. the wooll is fine on most parts of the body\r\nbut not so long as that of our domestic sheep. the wooll is also curled\r\nand thick. on the back and more particularly on the top of the neck the\r\nwooll is intermixed with a considerable proportion of long streight\r\nhairs. there is no wooll on a small part of the body behind the\r\nsholders on each side of the brisquit which is covered with a short\r\nfine hairs as in the domestic sheep. form the signs which the Indians\r\nmake in discribing this animal they have herect pointed horns, tho one\r\nof our Engages La Page, assures us that he saw them in the black hills\r\nwhere the little Missouri passes them, and that they were in every\r\nrispect like the domestic sheep, and like them the males had lunated\r\nhorns bent backwards and twisted. I should be much pleased at meeting\r\nwith this animal, but have had too many proofs to admit a doubt of it's\r\nexisting and in considerable numbers in the mountains near this coast.\r\nthe Beaver and common Otter have before been mentioned in treating of\r\nthe occupations of the natives in hunting fishing &c. these do not\r\ndiffer from those of other parts of the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 22, 1806]\r\nSaturday February 22nd 1806\r\nWe were visited to day by two Clatsops women and two boys who brought a\r\nparcel of excellent hats made of Cedar bark, and ornemented with bear\r\ngrass. two of those hats had been made by measure which Capt Lewis and\r\nmy Self had given a woman Some time Since, with a request to make each\r\nof us a hat; they fit us very well, and are in the form we desired\r\nthem. we purchased the hats and distribeted them among the party. the\r\nwoodwork and sculpture of these people as well as those hats and the\r\nwater proof baskits evince an ingenuity by no means common among the\r\nAborigenes of America. in the evining they returned to their village\r\nand Drewyer accompanied them in order to get Some dogs &c. These women\r\ninformed us that the Small fish began to run which we suppose to be\r\nherring from their discription. they also informed us that their Chief\r\nConia Comawool, had gorn up the Columbia to the Vally in order to\r\npurchase Wappatoe, a part of which he entended tradeing with us on his\r\nreturn. our sick consisting of Gibson, Bratten, Willard McNeal and\r\nBaptiest LaPage is Something better Serjt. Ordway is complaining of a\r\nCoald & head ake. we have not had as many Sick at one time Since we\r\nleft the Settlements of the Illinois. the general Complaint appears to\r\nbe bad colds and fevers, with a violent pain in the head, and back,\r\nsomething I believe of the influenza.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope is found in the great plains of Columbia and are the Same\r\nwith those of the Missouri found in every part of that untimbered\r\nCountry. they are by no means as plenty on this Side of the Rocky\r\nMountains as on the other. the nativs here make robes of their Skins\r\ndressed withe the hair on them. when the Salmon begin to decline in the\r\nlatter end of Summer and autumn, the nativs leave the river, at least a\r\nmajority and move out into the plains at Some distance for the purpose\r\nof hunting the Antelope. they pursue them on hors back and Shute them\r\nwith their arrows.\r\n\r\nThe Sheep is found in various parts of the Rocky Mountains, but most\r\nCommonly on those parts which are timbered and Steep. they are also\r\nfound in greater abundance on the chain of mountains which forms the\r\nCommencement of the woody country on this Coast and which pass the\r\nColumbia between the great falls and rapids. we have never met with\r\nthis animal ourselves but have Seen maney of their Skins in the\r\npossession of the nativs dressed with the wool on them and also Seen\r\nand have the blankets which they manufacture of the wool of this Sheep.\r\nfrom the Skin the animal appears to be about the Size of the common\r\nSheep; of a white colour. the wool is fine on most parts of the body,\r\nbut not so long as that of the domestic Sheep; the wool is also Curled\r\nand thick. on the back and more particularly on the top of the neck the\r\nwool is intermixed with a Considerable proportion of long Streight\r\nhair. there is no wool on a Small part of the body behind the Sholders\r\non each Side of the brisquit which is covered with a Short fine hairs\r\nas in the domestic Sheep. from the Signs which the Indians make in\r\ndiscribing this animale they have herect pointed horns, tho one of our\r\nEngages Lapage, assures us that he Saw them in the Black hills where\r\nthe Little Missouri river passes them, and that they were in every\r\nrespect like our domestic Sheep, and like them the mail had lunated\r\nhorns bent backwards and twisted. I should be much pleased at meeting\r\nwith this animal. but have had too maney proofs to admit a doubt of\r\nit's existing and in considerable numbers in the mountains on this\r\nCoast. The Beaver and Common Otter have before been mentioned in\r\ntreating of the Occupation of the nativs in hunting, fishing, &c. these\r\ndo not differ from those of other parts of the Continent-.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 23, 1806]\r\nSunday February 23rd 1806.\r\nnot anything transpired during this day worthy of particular notice.\r\nour sick are all on the recovery, except Sergt. Ordway who is but\r\nlittle wose and not very ill tho more so than any of the others. the\r\nmen have provided themselves very amply with mockersons and leather\r\ncloathing, much more so indeed than they ever have since they have been\r\non this voige.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Otter is found on the sea coast and in the salt water. this\r\nanamal when fully grown is as large as a common mastive dog. the ears\r\nand eyes are remarkaby small, particularly the former which is not an\r\ninch in length thick fleshey and pointed covered with short hair. the\r\ntail is about 10 inches in length thick where it joins the body and\r\ntapering to a very sharp point; in common with the body it is covered\r\nwith a deep fir particularly on the upper side, on the under part the\r\nfur is not so long. the legs are remarkably short and the feet, which\r\nhave five toes each are broad large and webbed. the legs are covered\r\nwith fur and the feet with short hair. the body of this animal is long\r\nand nearly of the same thickness throughout. from the extremity of the\r\ntail to that of the nose they will measure 5 feet or upwards. the\r\ncolour is a uniform dark brown and when in good order and season\r\nperfectly black and glossey. it is the riches and I think the most\r\ndelicious fur in the world at least I cannot form an idea of any more\r\nso. it is deep thick silkey in the extreem and strong. the inner part\r\nof the fur when opened is lighter than the surface in it's natural\r\nposition. there are some fine black and shining hairs intermixed with\r\nthe fur which are reather longer and add much to it's beauty. the nose,\r\nabout the eyes ears and forehead in some of these otter is of a lighter\r\ncolour, sometimes a light brown. those parts in the young sucking Otter\r\nof this species is sometimes of a cream coloured white, but always much\r\nlighter than the other parts. the fur of the infant Otter is much\r\ninferior in point of colour and texture to that of the full grown\r\notter, or even after it has been weaned. there is so great a difference\r\nthat I have for some time supposed it a different animal; the Indians\r\ncalled the infant Otter Spuck, and the full grow or such as had\r\nobtained a coat of good fur, E-luck'-ke. this still further confirmed\r\nthe opinion of their being distinct species; but I have since learned\r\nthat the Spuck is the young Otter. the colour of the neck, body, legs\r\nand tail is a dark lead brown. The mink is found in the woody country\r\non this coast, and dose not differ in any particu from those of the\r\nAtlantic coast. the seal are found here in great numbers, and as far up\r\nthe Columbia river as the great falls above which there are none. I\r\nhave reason to beleive from the information of the men that there are\r\nseveral species of the seal on this coast and in the river but what the\r\ndifference is I am unable to state not having seen them myself\r\nsufficiently near for minute inspection nor obtained the different\r\nkinds to make a comparison. the skins of such as I have seen are\r\ncovered with a short coarse stiff and glossey hair of a redish hey\r\nbrown colour. tho the anamal while in the water or as we saw them\r\nfrequently in the river appear to be black and spoted with white\r\nsometimes. when we first saw those animals at the great falls and\r\nuntill our arrival at this place we conseived they were the Sea Otter.\r\nbut the indians here have undeceived us.--I am not much acquainted with\r\nthe Seal but suppose that they are the same common also to the Atlantic\r\nOcean in the same parallel of latitude. the skins I have seen are\r\nprecisely such as our trunks are frequently covered with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 23, 1806]\r\nSunday February 23rd 1806.\r\nNot any thing transpired desering particular notice. our Sick are all\r\non the recovery. the men have provided themselves verry amply with\r\nmockersons & leather clothing, much more So indeed than they have ever\r\nbeen Since they have been on the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Otter is found only on the Sea Coast and in the Salt water.\r\nThose animals which I took to be the Sea Otter from the Great Falls of\r\nthe Columbia to the mouth, proves to be the Phosia or Seal which at a\r\nlittle distance has every appearance of the Sea Otters. The Sea otter\r\nwhen fully grown is as large as the common mastif dog, the eail and\r\nEyes are remarkably Small, particularly the former which is not an inch\r\nin length thick fleshey and pointed, Covered with short hair. the tail\r\nis about 10 inches in length thick where it joins the body and tapering\r\nto a very Sharp point; in common with the body it is covered with a\r\ndeep fur particularly on the upper Side, on the under part the fur is\r\nnot So long. the legs are remarkably Short and the feat which have five\r\ntoes each are broad large and webbed. the legs are covered with fur and\r\nthe feet with Short hair. the body of this Animal is long and nearly of\r\nthe Same thickness throughout. from the extremity of the tail to that\r\nof the nose they will measure 5 feet or upwards. the colour is of a\r\nuniform dark brown, and when in good order and Season perfectly Black\r\nand Glossey. it is the richest and I think the most delightfull fur in\r\nthe world at least I cannot form an idea of any more so. it is deep\r\nthick silky in the extream and Strong. the inner part of the fur when\r\nopen is lighter than the surface in its natural position. there are\r\nSome fine black Shineing hairs intermixed with the fur which are\r\nreather longer and add much to its beauty. the nose, about the eyes,\r\nears and forehead in Some of those otter is of a light Colour,\r\nSometimes a light brown. those parts in the young Suckling otters of\r\nthis Species is Sometimes of a creem colour'd white, but always much\r\nlighter than the other parts. the fur of the infant otter is much\r\ninferior in point of colour, and texture, to that of the full grown\r\notter, or even after it has been weened-. there is so great a\r\ndifference that I have for Some time Supposed it a different animal;\r\nthe Indians Call the infant otter Spuck, and the full grown or such as\r\nhad obtained a Coat of good fur, E luck'ko. this Still further\r\nconfirmed the opinion of their being distinct Species; but I have Since\r\nlerned that the Spuck is the young otter. the Colour of the neck, body,\r\nlegs and tail is a dark lead brown. The Mink is found in the woody\r\nCountry on this Coast and does not differ in any particular from those\r\nof the Atlantic Coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Seal or Phoca are found here in great numbers, and as far up the\r\nColumbia as the great Falls, above which there are none. I have reasons\r\nto believe from the information of the men that there are Several\r\nSpecies of the Phoca on this Coast and in the river, but what the\r\ndifference is I am unable to State not haveing Seen them myself\r\nSufficiently near for manute inspection nor obtain the different kinds\r\nto make a comparison. the Skins of Such as I have Seen are covered with\r\na Short thick Coarse Glossy hair of a redish bey brown Colour. tho the\r\nanimal while in the water, or as we saw them frequently in the river\r\nappear to be black and Spoted with white sometimes. I am not much\r\nacquainted with the Seal, but Suppose that they are the Same common\r\nalso to the atlantic Ocian in the Same parrelal of Latitude. the Skins,\r\nor those which I have Seen are presisely Such as trunks are frequently\r\nCovered with. the flesh of this animal is highly prised by the nativs\r\nwho Swinge the hair off and then roste the flesh on Sticks before the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 24, 1806]\r\nMonday February 24th 1806.\r\nOur sick are still on the recovery. Shannon & Labuishe returned in the\r\nforenoon; they had killed no Elk and reported that they beleived the\r\nElk have retired from their former haunts and gone further back in the\r\ncountry to a considerable distance from this place. this is very\r\nunwelcome information for poor and inferior as the flesh of this animal\r\nis it is our principal dependance for subsistence.\r\n\r\nThis evening we were visited by Comowooll the Clatsop Chief and 12 men\r\nwomen & children of his nation. Drewyer came a passenger in their\r\ncanoe, and brought with him two dogs. The chief and his party had\r\nbrought for sail a Sea Otter skin some hats, stergeon and a species of\r\nsmall fish which now begin to run, and are taken in great quantities in\r\nthe Columbia R. about 40 miles above us by means of skiming or scooping\r\nnets. on this page I have drawn the likeness of them as large as life;\r\nit as perfect as I can make it with my pen and will serve to give a\r\ngeneral idea of the fish. the rays of the fins are boney but not sharp\r\ntho somewhat pointed. the small fin on the back next to the tail has no\r\nrays of bone being a thin membranous pellicle. the fins next to the\r\ngills have eleven rays each. those of the abdomen have eight each,\r\nthose of the pinna-ani are 20 and 2 half formed in front. that of the\r\nback has eleven rays. all the fins are of a white colour. the back is\r\nof a bluish duskey colour and that of the lower part of the sides and\r\nbelley is of a silvery white. no spots on any part. the first bone of\r\nthe gills next behid the eye is of a bluis cast, and the second of a\r\nlight goald colour nearly white. the puple of the eye is black and the\r\niris of a silver white. the underjaw exceeds the uper; and the mouth\r\nopens to great extent, folding like that of the herring. it has no\r\nteeth. the abdomen is obtuse and smooth; in this differing from the\r\nherring, shad anchovey &c of the Malacopterygious Order & Class Clupea,\r\nto which however I think it more nearly allyed than to any other altho\r\nit has not their accute and serrate abdomen and the under jaw exceeding\r\nthe upper. the scales of this little fish are so small and thin that\r\nwithout minute inspection you would suppose they had none. they are\r\nfilled with roes of a pure white colour and have scarcely any\r\nperceptable alimentary duct. I find them best when cooked in Indian\r\nstile, which is by roasting a number of them together on a wooden spit\r\nwithout any previous preperation whatever. they are so fat they require\r\nno additional sauce, and I think them superior to any fish I ever\r\ntasted, even more delicate and lussious than the white fish of the\r\nlakes which have heretofore formed my standart of excellence among the\r\nfishes. I have heard the fresh anchovey much extolled but I hope I\r\nshall be pardoned for beleiving this quite as good. the bones are so\r\nsoft and fine that they form no obstruction in eating this fish. we\r\npurchased all the articles which these people brought us; we suffered\r\nthese people to remain all night as it rained, the wind blew most\r\nviolently and they had their women and children with them; the latter\r\nbeing a sure pledge of their pacific dispositions. the Sturgeon which\r\nthey brought us was also good of it's kind. we determine to send a\r\nparty up the river to procure some of those fish, and another in some\r\ndirection to hunt Elk as soon as the weather will permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 24, 1806]\r\nMonday February 24th 1806\r\nOur Sick are Still on the recovery. Shannon and Labiche returned in the\r\nforenoon, they had killed no Elk, and reported that they believe the\r\nElk have returned from their former haunts and gorn further back in the\r\nmountains to a considerable distance from this place. this is very\r\nunwelcom information, for poore and inferior as the flesh of this\r\nanimale is, it is our principal dependance for Subsistance.\r\n\r\nThe Rackoon is found in the woody Country on the Coast in considerable\r\nquantities. the nativs take a fiew of them in Snars, and deadfalls; tho\r\nappear not to value their Skins much, and but Seldom prepare them for\r\nrobes. The large Grey Squirel appear to be a native of a narrow tract\r\nof Country on the upper Side of the mountains below the Great falls of\r\nColumbia which is pritty well covered in maney parts with a Species of\r\nwhite oak. this animal is much larger than the Gray Squirel of our\r\nCountry, it resembles it much in form and colour. it is as large as the\r\nFox Squirel of the South Atlantic States. the tail is reather larger\r\nthan the whole of the body and head, the hair of which is long and tho\r\ninserted on all Sides reispect the horozontal one. the eyes are black,\r\nwhiskers black and long. the back, Sides, head, tale and outer parts of\r\nthe legs are of a blue lead colour grey. the breast, belly, and inner\r\nparts of the legs are of a pure white. the hair is Short as that of the\r\nFox Squirel but is much finer and intermixed with a propotion of fur.\r\nthe nativs make great use of those Skins in forming their robes. this\r\nSquirel Subsists principally on the acorn and filburts, which last also\r\ngrow abundantly in the Oak Country-. The Small brown Squirel is a\r\nbutifull little animal about the size of the red Squirel of the E.\r\nStates or Something larger than the ground Squirel of the U States. the\r\ntail is as long as the body and neck formed Somewhat Hat. the eyes\r\nblack, whiskers long and black but not abundant. the back, Sides, head,\r\nneck and outer parts of the legs are of a redish dark brown. the\r\nthroat, breast, belly and inner parts of the legs are of a pale brick\r\nred. the tail is a mixture of black and fox coloured red in which the\r\nblack prodomonates in the middle, and the other on the edges and\r\nextremity. the hair of the body is about 1/2 inch long and So fine and\r\nsoft that it has the appearance of fur. the hair of the tail is coarser\r\nand double as long. this animal Subsists principally on the Seeds of\r\nvarious Species of pine and are always found in the piney Country. they\r\nare common to the tract of woody country on this coast. they lodge in\r\nClefts of rocks, holes in the Ground, old Stumps of trees and the\r\nhollow trunks of falling timber; in this respect resemble the rat\r\nalways haveing their habitation in or near the earth. The Small Grey\r\nSquirel Common to every part of the Rocky Mountains which is timbered,\r\ndiffer from the dark brown squirel just discribed only in its colour.\r\n\r\nit's back, neck, Sides, head, tail and outer Sides of the legs are of\r\nbrown lead coloured Grey; the tail has a Slight touch of the fox colour\r\nnear the extremity of some of the hairs. the throat, belly, breast, and\r\ninner part of the legs are of the Colour of tanners ooze and have a\r\nnarrow Stripe of black commencing behing each Sholder and extending\r\nlongitudinally for about 3 inches between the Colours of the Side &\r\nbelly. their habits are also the Same with the dark brown Squirel of\r\nthis neighbourhood, and like them are extreamly nimble and active. The\r\nGround Squirel is found in various parts of the Countrey as well the\r\nPraries as wood lands, and is one of the fiew animals which we have\r\nSeen in every part of our voy-age. it differs not at all from those of\r\nthe U, States.\r\n\r\nThe Barking Squirel and handsom Ground Squirel of the Plains on the\r\nEast Side of the Rocky Mountains are not found in the plains of the\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThis evening we were visited by Comowooll the Clatsop Chief and 14 men\r\nwomen and Children of his nation.

The large grey squirrel appears to be a native of a narrow tract\r\nof country on the upper side of the mountains just below the grand\r\nfalls of Columbia which is pretty well covered in many parts with a\r\nspecies of white oak. in short I beleive this squirrel to be\r\ncoextensive with timber only, as we have not seen them in any part of\r\nthe country where pine forms the majority of the timber, or in which\r\nthe oak dose not appear. this animal is much larger than the grey\r\nsquirrel of our country it resembles it much in form and colours. it is\r\nas large as the fox squirrel of the Southern Atlantic states. the tail\r\nis reather longer than the whole length of the body and head. the hair\r\nof which is long and tho inserted on all sides reispect the horizontal\r\nones only. the eyes are black. whiskers black and long. the back,\r\nsides, head, tail and outer part of the legs are of a blue lead\r\ncoloured grey. the breast belley and inner part of the legs are of a\r\npure white. the hair is short as that of the fox-squirrel but is much\r\nfiner and intermixed with a proportion of fur. the natives make great\r\nuse of these skins in forming their robes. this squirrel subsists\r\nprincipally on the acorn and filbird which last also grows abundantly\r\nin the oak country.--The small brown squirrel is a beautifull little\r\nanimal about the size and form of the red squirrel of the Eastern\r\nAtlantic states and western lakes. the tail is as long as the body and\r\nneck, formed like that of the red squirrel or somewhat flat. the eyes\r\nblack. whiskers long and black but not abundant. the back, sides, head,\r\nneck and outer part of the legs are of a redish dark brown. the throat,\r\nbreast, belley and inner part of the legs are of a pale brick red. the\r\ntail is a mixture of black and fox coloured red in which the black\r\npredominates in the midle and the other on the edges and extremity. the\r\nhair of the body is about 1/2 an inch long and so fine and soft that it\r\nhas the appearance of fur. the hair of the tail is coarser and doubly\r\nas long. this animal subsists principally on the seeds of various\r\nspecies of pine, and are always found in the piny country they are\r\ncommon to the tract of wooddy country on this coast. they lodge in\r\nclifts of rocks, holes in the ground old stumps of trees and the hollow\r\ntrunks of fallen timber; in this rispect resembling the rat, always\r\nhaving their habitatin in or near the earth. the small grey squirrel\r\ncommon to every part of the rocky mountain which is timbered, difirs\r\nfrom the dark brown squirrel just discribed only in it's colour. it's\r\nback, sides, neck, head tail and outer side of the legs are of a brown\r\nlead coloured grey; the tail has a slight touch of the fox colour near\r\nthe extremity of some of the hairs. the throat, breast, belley, and\r\ninner parts of the legs are of the colour of tanner's ooze and have a\r\nnarrow stripe of black, commencing just behide each sholder and\r\nextending longitudinaly for about 3 inches betwen the colours of the\r\nsides and belley. their habids are also the same of the dark brown\r\nsquirrel of this neighbourhood and like them are extreemly nimble and\r\nactive. the ground squirrel is found in every part of the country, as\r\nwell the praries as woodlands, and is one of the few animals which we\r\nhave seen in every part of our voyage. it differs not at all from those\r\nof the U States. the barking squirrel and handsome ground squirrel of\r\nthe plains on the East side of the rocky mountains are not found in the\r\nplains of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 25, 1806]\r\nTuesday February 25th 1806\r\nIt continued to rain and blow So violently that there was no movement\r\nof the party to day. the Indians left us in the morning on their return\r\nto their village. Willard Somewhat worse the others are on the\r\nrecovery. we are mortified at not haveing it in our power to make more\r\nCelestial observations since we have been at Fort Clatsop, but Such has\r\nbeen the State of the weather that we have found it utterly\r\nimpractiable-. I purchased of the Clatsops this morning about half a\r\nbushel of Small fish which they had cought about 40 miles up the\r\nColumbia in their scooping nets. as this is an uncommon fish to me and\r\none which no one of the party has ever Seen. on the next page I have\r\ndrawn the likeness of them as large as life; it's as perfect as I can\r\nmake it with my pen and will Serve to give a general idea of the fish.\r\nthe rays of the fins are boney but not Sharp tho Somewhat pointed. the\r\nSmall fin on the back next to the tail has no rays of bone being a thin\r\nmembranous pellicle. the fins next to the gills have eleven rays each.\r\nthose of the abdomen have Eight each, those of the pinna ani are 20 and\r\n2 half formed in front. that of the back has eleven rays. all the fins\r\nare of a white colour. the back is of a blueish duskey colour and that\r\nof the lower part of the Sides and belly is of a Silvery White. no\r\nSpots on any part. the first of the gills next behind the eye is of a\r\nblueish cast, and the second of a light gold colour nearly white. the\r\npuple of the eye is black and the iris of a silver white. the under jaw\r\nexceeds the upper; and the mouth opens to great extent, folding like\r\nthat of the Herring. it has no teeth. the abdomen is obtuse and Smooth;\r\nin this differing from the herring, Shad, anchovey &c. of the\r\nMalacapterygious Order and Class Clupea, to which however I think it\r\nmore nearly allyed than to any other altho it has not their accute and\r\nSerrate abdomen and the under jaw exceeding the upper. the scales of\r\nthis little fish are So small and thin that without manute inspection\r\nyou would Suppose they had none. they are filled with roes of a pure\r\nwhite Colour and have Scercely any perceptable alimentary duct. I found\r\nthem best when cooked in Indian Stile, which is by rosting a number of\r\nthem together on a wooden spit without any previous preperation\r\nwhatever. they are so fat that they require no aditional sauce, and I\r\nthink them Superior to any fish I ever tasted, even more dilicate and\r\nlussious than the white fish of the Lakes which have heretofore formed\r\nmy Standard of excellence among the fishes. I have herd the fresh\r\nanchovey much extoll'd but I hope I shall be pardened for believeing\r\nthis quit as good. the bones are So Soft and fine that they form no\r\nobstruction in eating this fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 26, 1806]\r\nWednesday February 26th 1806.\r\nThis morning we dispatched Drewyer and two men in our Indian canoe up\r\nthe Columbia River to take sturgeon and Anchovey. or if they were\r\nunsuccessfull in fishing we directed them to purchase fish from the\r\nnatives for which purpose we had furnished them with a few articles\r\nsuch as the natives are pleased with. we also Sent Shields, Joseph\r\nFields and Shannon up the Netul to hunt Elk. and directed Reubin Fields\r\nand some others to hunt in the point towards the praries of Point\r\nAdams. thus we hope shortly to replenish our stock of provision which\r\nis now reduced to a mere minnamum. we have three days provision only in\r\nstore and that of the most inferior dryed Elk a little tainted. a\r\ncomfortable prospect for good living. Sewelel is the Chinnook and\r\nClatsop name for a small animal found in the timbered country on this\r\ncoast. it is more abundant in the neighbourhood of the great falls and\r\nrapids of the Columbia than immediately on the coast. the natives make\r\ngreat use of the skins of this animal in forming their robes, which\r\nthey dress with the fur on them and attatch together with sinews of the\r\nElk or deer. I have never seen the animal and can therefore discribe it\r\nonly from the skin and a slight view which some of our hunters have\r\nobtained of the living animal. the skin when dressed is from 14 to 18\r\ninches in length and from 7 to 9 in width; the tail is always severed\r\nfrom the skin in forming their robes I cannot therefore say what form\r\nor length it is. one of the men informed me that he thought it reather\r\nshort and flat. that he saw one of them run up a tree like a squirrel\r\nand that it returned and ran into a hole in the ground. the ears are\r\nshort thin pointed and covered with short fine hair. they are of a\r\nuniform colour, a redish brown; tho the base of the long hairs, which\r\nexceed the fur but little in length, as well as the fur itself is of a\r\ndark colour for at least two thirds of it's length next to the skin.\r\nthe fur and hair are very fine, short, thickly set and silky. the ends\r\nof the fur and tips of the hair being of the redish brown that colour\r\npredominates in the ordinary appearance of the animal. I take this\r\nanimal to be about the size of the barking squirrel of the Missouri.\r\nand beleive most probably that it is of the Mustela genus, or perhaps\r\nthe brown mungo itself. I have indeavoured in many instances to make\r\nthe indians sensible how anxious I was to obtain one of these animals\r\nentire, without being skined, and offered them considerable rewards to\r\nfurnish me with one, but have not been able to make them comprehend me.\r\nI have purchased several of the robes made of these skins to line a\r\ncoat which I have had made of the skins of the tiger cat. they make a\r\nvery pleasant light lining. the Braro so called by the French engages\r\nis an animal of the civit genus and much resembles the common badger.\r\nthis is an inhabitant of the open plains of the Columbia as they are of\r\nthose of the Missouri but are sometimes also found in the woody\r\ncountry. they burrow in the hard grounds of the plains with surprising\r\nease and dexterity an will cover themselves in the ground in a very few\r\nminutes. they have five long fixed nails on each foot; those of the\r\nforefeet are much the longest; and one of those on each hind foot is\r\ndouble like those of the beaver. they weigh from 14 to 18 lbs. the body\r\nis reather long in proportion to it's thickness. the forelegs\r\nremarkably large and muscular and are formed like the ternspit dog.\r\nthey are short as are also the hind legs. they are broad across the\r\nsholders and brest. the neck short. the head is formed much like the\r\ncommon fist dog only that the skull is more convex. the mouth is wide\r\nand furnished with sharp streight teeth both above and below, with four\r\nsharp streight pointed tusks, two in the upper and two in the lower\r\njaw. the eyes are black and small. whiskers are plased in four points\r\non each side near the nose and on the jaws near the opening of the\r\nmouth. the ears are very short wide and appressed as if they had ben\r\ncut off. the apperture through them to the head is remarkably small.\r\nthe tail is about 4 inches long; the hair longest on it at it's\r\njunction with the body and becoming shorter towards it's extremity\r\nwhere it ends in an accute point. the hairs of the body are much longer\r\non the side and rump than any other part, which gives the body and\r\napparent flatness, particularly when the animal rests on it's belley.\r\nthis hair is upwards of 3 inches in length particularly on the rump\r\nwhere it extends so far towards the point of the tail that it almost\r\nconceals the shape of that part and gives to the whole of the hinder\r\npart of the body the figure of an accute angled triangle of which the\r\npoint of the tail forms the accute angle. the small quantity of coarse\r\nfur which is intermixed with the hair is of a redish pale yellow. the\r\nhair of the back, sides, upper part of the neck and tail, are of a\r\nredish light or pale yellow for about 2/3rds of their length from the\r\nskin, next black, and then tiped with white; forming a curious mixture\r\nof grey and fox coloured red with a yellowish hue. the belley flanks\r\nand breast are of the foxcoloured redish yellow. the legs black. the\r\nnails white the head on which the hair is short, is varia gated with\r\nblack and white. a narrow strip of white commences on the top of the\r\nnose about 1/2 an inch from it's extremity and extends back along the\r\ncenter of the forehead and neck nearly to the sholders--two stripes of\r\nblack succeed the white on either side imbracing the sides of the nose,\r\nthe eyes, and extends back as far as the ears. two other spots of black\r\nof a ramboidal figure are placed on the side of the head near the ears\r\nand between them and the opening of the mouth. two black spots also\r\nimmediately behind the ears. the other parts of the head white. this\r\nanimal feeds on flesh, roots, bugs, and wild fruits.--it is very clumsy\r\nand runs very slow. I have in two instances out run this animal and\r\ncaught it. in this rispect they are not much more fleet than the\r\nporcupine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, February 26, 1806]\r\nWednesday February 26th 1806\r\nThis morning we dispatched Drewyer and two men in our indian canoe up\r\nthe Columbia River to take Sturgion and Anchovey. or if they were\r\nunsucksessfull in fishing we directed them to purchase fish from the\r\nnativs, for which purpose we had furnished them with a fiew articles\r\nSuch as the nativs are pleased with. we also Sent Shields Jo.

I have never\r\nSeen the ammale and can therefore only discribe it from the Skin and a\r\nSlight view which Some of our party have obtained of the liveing\r\nanimal. the Skin when dressed is from 14 to 18 inches in length, and\r\nfrom 7 to 9 in width; the tail is always Severed from the body in\r\nforming their robes, I cannot therefore Say in what form or length it\r\nis. one of the men informed me that he thought it reather Short and\r\nflat. that he saw one of them run up a tree like a squirel, and that it\r\nreturned and ran into a hole in the ground. the ears are Short, thin,\r\npointed and Covered with Short fine hair. they are of uniform Colour, a\r\nredish brown; tho the base of the long hairs, exceed the fur but little\r\nin length, as well as the fur itself is of a Dark colour for at least\r\n2/3ds of it's length next to the Skin. the fur and hair are very fine,\r\nShort, thickly Set, and Silky. the ends of the fur and tips of the hair\r\nis of a redish brown, that colour prodominates in the ordinary\r\nappearance of the Animate. I took this animal to be about the Size of\r\nthe barking Squirel of the Missouri. and believe most probably that it\r\nis of the Mustela genus, or perhaps the brown mungo itself I have in\r\nmaney instances endeavured to make the nativs Sensiable how anxious I\r\nwas to obtain one of those animals entire, without being Skined, and\r\noffered them rewards to furnish me with one, but have not been able to\r\nmake them Comprehend me. we have purchased Several of the roabs made of\r\nthose Skins to loin a westcoat of the Sea otter, which I have made and\r\nCapt Lewis a Tiger Cat Skin Coat loined with them also, they make a\r\nvery pleasant light lighting.\r\n\r\nThe Rat in the rocky mountains on its west side are like those on the\r\nupper part of the Missouri in and near those Mountains and have the\r\ndistingushing trait of possessing a tail covered with hair like other\r\nparts of the body; one of these we caught at the white bear Islands in\r\nthe beginning of July last and then partially discribed.\r\n\r\nThere is rats in this neighbourhood but I have not seen them it is most\r\nprobable that they are like those of the Atlantic States, or at least\r\nthe native rat of our country which have no hair on their tail. this\r\nSpecis we found on the Missouri as far up it as the woody country\r\nextended. it is as large as the Common European house rat or reather\r\nlarger is of a lighter Colour bordering more on the lead or drab\r\ncolour, the hair longer; and the female has only four tits which are\r\nplaced far back near the hinder legs. this rat I have Seen in the\r\nSouthern parts of the State of Kentucky & west of the Miami.\r\n\r\nThe Mouse and mole of this neighbourhood are the Same as those native\r\nanimals with us.\r\n\r\nThe Panther is found indifferently either in the great Plains of\r\nColumbia the Western Side of the Rocky Mountains or on this coast in\r\nthe timbered country. it is precisily the Same animal common to the\r\nAtlantic States, and most commonly met with on our frontiers or\r\nunsettled parts of the Country. this animal is Scerce in the Country\r\nwhere they exist and are So remarkable Shye and watchfull that it is\r\nextreamly dificuelt to kill them.\r\n\r\nThe Polecat is found in every part of the Country. they are very\r\nabundant on Some parts of the Columbia, particularly in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Great falls & Narrows of that river, where they\r\nlive in the Clifts along the river & feed on the offal of the Indian\r\nfishing Shores. they are the Same as those of other parts of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, February 27, 1806]\r\nThursday February 27th 1806.\r\nReubin Fields returned this evening and had not killed anything. he\r\nreports that there are no Elk towards point Adams.

Field and Shannon returned late this\r\nevening haveing killed five Elk tho two of them are of a mountain at a\r\nconsiderable distance. we ordered these hunters to return early in the\r\nmorning and continue the hunt, and Sergt. Gass to take a party and go\r\nin quest of the Elk which they had killed. the hunters informed us that\r\nthe Elk is tolerable plenty near the mountains about nine or ten miles\r\ndistant. Kuskalaw brought a dog which Peter Crusat had purchased with\r\nhis Capo which this fellow had on.\r\n\r\nThe Hare on this Side of the Rocky Mountains is exclusively the\r\ninhabitents of the Great Plains of Columbia, as they are of those of\r\nthe Missouri East of the mountains. they weigh from 7 to 12 pounds. the\r\nmeasure of one which weighed 10 pounds, was as follows. from the\r\nextremity of the hinder, to that of the fore feet when extended 3 Feet.\r\nlength from nose to the extremity of the tail 2 feet, 2 inches. Hight\r\nwhen Standing erect 1 foot, 3 inches-. Girth of the body 1 foot, 4\r\ninches-. length of tail 61/2 inches-. length of ear 51/2 inches-. width\r\nof ear 3 inches and 1/8-. from the hip to the extremity of toe of the\r\nhind foot 1 foot 41/4 inches-. The eye is large and prominent. the\r\npupil is circular, of a deep Sea Green and Occupies one third of the\r\ndiamiter of the eye, the iris is of a bright yellowish silver colour.\r\nThe ears are placed far back on the head and very near each other, they\r\nare flexable and the animal moves them with great ease and quickness\r\nand can dilate and throw them foward, or contract and fold them on his\r\nback at pleasure. the fold of the front of the ear is of a redish brown\r\ncolour, the inner folds are those which lie together when the ears are\r\nthrown back, and which occupies 2/3ds of the width of the ears of a\r\npure white except the tips of the ears for about an inch. the hinder\r\nfolds or those which lie on the back are of a light grey; the Sides as\r\nthey approach the belly become gradually more white, the belly brest,\r\nand inner part of the legs and thyes are white, with a Slight Shade of\r\na lead Colour. The Head, neck, back Sholders, Sides, outer part of the\r\nlegs and thyes are of a Lead Coloured Grey. the tail is bluntly pointed\r\nand round, covered with fine Soft white fur not quite as long as on the\r\nother parts of the body. the body is covered with a deep fine Soft\r\nclose fur. the colours here discribed are those which the Animale\r\nassumes from the middle of April to the middle of November, the\r\nballance of the year they are of a pure white, except the black and\r\nredish brown of the ears which never changes. a fiew redish brown spots\r\nare Sometimes Seen intermixed with the white, at this Season on the\r\nheads and upper parts of the neck an Sholders. The body of this animal\r\nis Smaller and longer in purpotion to it's hight than the Rabbit. when\r\nit runs it carrys its tail Streight behind in the direction of it's\r\nbody. they appear to run with more ease and bound with greater agility\r\nthan any animal I ever saw. they are extreemly fleet and never burrow\r\nor take Shelter in the grounds when pursued. it's teeth are like those\r\nof the rabit, as is also its upper lip which is divided as high as the\r\nnose. it's food is Grass, herbs, and in winter feeds much on the bark\r\nof Several arematic Shrubs which grow in the plains and the young\r\nwillows along the rivers and other water courses.--I have measured the\r\nleaps of this animal and find them commonly from 18 to 22 feet. they\r\nare Generally found Seperate, and never Seen to associate in any number\r\nor more than two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 1, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 1st 1806.\r\nThis morning Sergt. Gass and a party set out in quest of the Elk which\r\nhad been killed by the hunters the day before yesterday. they returned\r\nwith the flesh of three of them late in the evening. Thompson was left\r\nwith the hunters in order to jurk and take care of the flesh of the\r\nremaining two. Kuskelar and wife left us about noon. he had a good\r\nlooking boy of about 10 years of age with him who he informed us was\r\nhis slave. this boy had been taken prisoner by the Killamucks from some\r\nnation on the Coast to the S. East of them at a great distance. like\r\nother Indian nations they adopt their slaves in their families and\r\ntreat them very much as their own children. Reubin Fields and Collins\r\nwho have been absent since yesterday morning returned without having\r\nkilled any game. The birds of the Western side of the Rocky Mountain to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, for convenience I shall divide into two classes,\r\nwhich I shal designate from the habits of the birds, Terrestrial and\r\nAquatic.\r\n\r\nThe Grouse or Prarie hen is peculiarly the inhabitant of the Grait\r\nPlains of Columbia they do not differ from those of the upper portion\r\nof the Missouri, the tail of which is pointed or the feathers in it's\r\ncenter much longer than those on the sides. this Species differs\r\nessentially in the construction of this part of their plumage from\r\nthose of the Illinois which have their tails composed of fathers of\r\nequal length. in the winter season this bird is booted even to the\r\nfirst joint of it's toes. the toes are also curiously bordered on their\r\nlower edges with narrow hard scales which are placed very close to each\r\nother and extend horizontally about 1/8 of an inch on each side of the\r\ntoes thus adding to the width of the tread which nature seems\r\nbountifully to have furnished them at this season for passing over the\r\nsnow with more ease. in the summer season those scales fall off. They\r\nhave four toes on each foot. Their colour is a mixture of dark brown\r\nredish and yellowish brown and white confusedly mixed in which the\r\nredish brown prevails most on the upper parts of the body wings and\r\ntail and the white underneath the belley and lower parts of the breast\r\nand tail. they associate in large flocks in autumn & winter and are\r\nfrequently found in flocks of from five to six even in summer. They\r\nfeed on grass, insects, the leaves of various shrubs in the plains and\r\non the seeds of several species of spelts and wild rye which grow in\r\nthe richer parts of the plains. in winter their food is the buds of the\r\nwillow & Cottonwood also the most of the native berries furnish them\r\nwith food.The Indians of this neighbourhood eat the root of the Cattail\r\nor Cooper's flag. it is pleasantly taisted and appears to be very\r\nnutricious. the inner part of the root which is eaten without any\r\nprevious preperation is composed of a number of capillary white\r\nflexable strong fibers among which is a mealy or starch like substance\r\nwhich readily desolves in the mouth and separate from the fibers which\r\nare then rejected. it appears to me that this substance would make\r\nexcellent starch; nothing can be of a purer white than it is.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 1, 1806]\r\nSaturday March the 1st 1806\r\nThis morning we despatched Sergt. Gass with 12 men in two Canoes in\r\nquest of the Elk which had been killed by the hunters the day before\r\nyesterday. they returned with the flesh of three of them late in the\r\nevening. Thompson was left with the hunters in order to jurk and take\r\ncare of the flesh of the remaining two. Kuskalar &c. left us about\r\nnoon. The boy which this Indian offered to Sell to me is about 10 years\r\nof age. this boy had been taken prisoner by the Kit a mox from Some\r\nNation on the Coast to the S. East of them at a great distance. like\r\nother Indian nations they adopt their Slaves in their famelies and\r\ntreat them very much like their own Children. Reuben Field and Collins\r\nwho had been absent Since yesterday morning returned without killing\r\nany thing.\r\n\r\nThe birds on the western Side of the Rocky Mountain's to the Pacific\r\nOcian for Convenience I Shall devide into from the habit of the birds,\r\nTerrestrial and Aquatic. i e Fowls of the air, and fowls of the water.\r\n\r\nThe Prarie Hen sometimes called the Grouse is peculiarly the inhabitent\r\nof the Great Plains of Columbia. they do not differ from those of the\r\nupper portion of the Missouri, the tails of which is pointed or the\r\nfeathers in its center much longer than those on the Sides. this\r\nSpecies differ assentially in the construction of this part of their\r\nplumage from those of the Illinois which have their tail composed of\r\nfeathers of equal length. in the winter Season this berd is booted even\r\nto the first joint of it's toes. the toes are also curiously bordered\r\non their lower edges with narrow hard scales which are placed very\r\nclose to each other and extend horizontally about 1/8 of an inch on\r\neach Side of the toe, thus adding to the width of the tread which\r\nnature Seams bountifully to have furnished them with at this Season for\r\npassing over the Snow with more ease. in the Summer Season those Scales\r\nfall off. they have four toes on each foot. their colour is a mixture\r\nof dark brown redish and yellowish brown and white confusedly mixed in\r\nwhich the redish brown prevails most on the upper parts of the body\r\nwings and tail. and the white underneath the belley and lower parts of\r\nthe breast and tail. they associate in large flocks in autumn & winter\r\nand are frequently found in flocks of from five to Six even in Summer.\r\nThey feed on grass, insects, the leaves of various Shrubs in the\r\nPraries, and on the Seeds of Several Species of Spelts and wild rye\r\nwhich grow in the richer parts of the Plains. in the winter their food\r\nis the buds of the willow and Cottonwood also the most of the native\r\nberries furnish them with food. they cohabit in flock & the Cocks fight\r\nverry much at those Seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 2, 1806]\r\nSunday March 2cd\r\nThe diet of the sick is so inferior that they recover their strength\r\nbut slowly. none of them are now sick but all in a state of\r\nconvalessence with keen appetites and nothing to eat except lean Elk\r\nmeat. late this evening Drewyer arrived with a most acceptable supply\r\nof fat Sturgeon, fresh Anchovies and a bag containing about a bushel of\r\nWappetoe. we feasted on Anchovies and Wappetoe.\r\n\r\nThe Cock of the Plains is found in the plains of Columbia and are in\r\nGreat abundance from the entrance of the S. E. fork of the Columbia to\r\nthat of Clark's river. this bird is about 2/3rds the size of a turkey.\r\nthe beak is large short curved and convex. the upper exceeding the\r\nlower chap. the nostrils are large and the beak black. the colour is an\r\nuniform mixture of dark brown reather bordeing on a dove colour, redish\r\nand yellowish brown with some small black specks. in this mixture the\r\ndark brown prevails and has a slight cast of the dove colour at a\r\nlittle distance. the wider side of the large feathers of the wings are\r\nof a dark brown only. the tail is composed of 19 feathers of which that\r\nin the center is the longest, and the remaining 9 on each side deminish\r\nby pairs as they receede from the center; that is any one feather is\r\nequal in length to one equa distant from the center of the tail on the\r\noposite side. the tail when foalded comes to a very sharp point and\r\nappears long in proportion to the body. in the act of flying the tail\r\nresembles that of a wild pigeon. tho the motion of the wings is much\r\nthat of the pheasant and Grouse. they have four toes on each foot of\r\nwhich the hinder one is short. the leg is covered with feathers about\r\nhalf the distance between the knee and foot. when the wing is expanded\r\nthere are wide opening between it's feathers the plumeage being so\r\nnarrow that it dose not extend from one quill to the other. the wings\r\nare also proportionably short, reather more so than those of the\r\npheasant or grouse. the habits of this bird are much the same as those\r\nof the grouse. only that the food of this fowl is almost entirely that\r\nof the leaf and buds of the pulpy leafed thorn; nor do I ever recollect\r\nseeing this bird but in the neighbourhood of that shrub. they sometimes\r\nfeed on the prickley pear. the gizzard of it is large and much less\r\ncompressed and muscular than in most fowls; in short it resembles a maw\r\nquite as much as a gizzard. when they fly they make a cackling noise\r\nsomething like the dunghill fowl. the following is a likeness of the\r\nhead and beak. the flesh of the cock of the Plains is dark, and only\r\ntolerable in point of flavor. I do not think it as good as either the\r\nPheasant or Grouse.--it is invariably found in the plains.The feathers\r\nabout it's head are pointed and stif some hairs about the base of the\r\nbeak. feathers short fine and stif about the ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 2, 1806]\r\nSunday March 2nd 1806\r\nThe diet of the Sick is So inferior that they recover their Strength\r\nbut Slowly. none of them are now Sick but all in a State of\r\nCovelessence with keen appetites and nothing to eate except lean Elk\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nThe nativs of this neighbourhood eate the root of the Cattail or\r\nCooper's flag. it is pleasantly tasted and appears to be very\r\nnutrecious. the inner part of the root which is eaten without any\r\nprevious preperation is Composed of a number of capellary white\r\nflexable Strong fibers among which is a mealy or Starch like Substance\r\nwhich readily disolves in the mouth and Seperates from the fibers which\r\nare then rejected. it appears to me that this Substance would make\r\nexcellent Starch; nothing Can be of a pureer white than it is\r\n\r\nThis evening late Drewyer, Crusat & Wiser returned with a most\r\nacceptable Supply of fat Sturgen, fresh anchoves and a bag Containing\r\nabout a bushel of Wappato. we feasted on the Anchovies and wappatoe.-.\r\n\r\nThe Heath Cock or cock of the Plains is found in the Plains of Columbia\r\nand are in great abundance from the enterance of Lewis's river to the\r\nmountains which pass the Columbia between the Great falls and Rapids of\r\nthat river. this fowl is about 3/4ths the Size of a turkey. the beak is\r\nlarge Short Curved and convex. the upper exceeding the lower chap. the\r\nnostrils are large and the back black. the Colour is a uniform mixture\r\nof dark brown reather bordering on a dove colour, redish and yellowish\r\nbrown with Some Small black Specks. in this mixture the dark brown\r\nprovails and has a Slight cast of the dove colour at a little distance.\r\nthe wider side of the larger feathers of the wings are of a dark brown\r\nonly. the tail is composed of 19 feathers of which that in the center\r\nis the longest, and the remaining 9 on each Side deminish by pairs as\r\nthey receede from the Center; that is any one feather is equal in\r\nlength to one of an equal distance from the Center of the tail on the\r\nopposit Side. the tail when folded Comes to a very Sharp point and\r\nappears long in perpotion to the body in the act of flying the tail\r\nresembles that of a wild pigeon. tho the motion of the wings is much\r\nthat of the Pheasant and Grouse. they have four toes on each foot of\r\nwhich the hinder one is Short. the leg is covered with feathers about\r\nhalf the distance between the knee and foot. when the wings is expanded\r\nthere are wide opening between it's feathers, the plumage being So\r\nnarrow that it does not extend from one quill to another. the wings are\r\nalso propotionably Short, reather more So than those of the Pheasant or\r\nGrouse. the habits of this bird is much the Same as those of the Prarie\r\nhen or Grouse. only that the food of this fowl is almost entirely that\r\nof the leaf and buds of the pulpy leafed thorn, nor do I ever recollect\r\nSeeing this bird but in the neighbourhood of that Shrub. The gizzard of\r\nit is large and much less compressed and muscular than in most fowls,\r\nin Short it resembles a maw quite as much as a gizzard. When they fly\r\nthey make a cackling noise Something like the dunghill fowl. the flesh\r\nof this fowl is dark and only tolerable in point of flavour. I do not\r\nthink it as good as wth the Pheasant or Prarie hen, or Grouse. the\r\nfeathers above it's head are pointed and Stiff Some hairs about the\r\nbase of the beak. feathers Short fine and Stiff about the ears, and\r\neye. This is a faint likeness of the Cock of the plains or Heath Cock\r\nthe first of those fowls which we met with was on the Missouri below\r\nand in the neighbourhood of the Rocky Mountains and from to the\r\nmountain which passes the Columbia between the Great falls and Rapids\r\nthey go in large gangues or Singularly and hide remarkably close when\r\npursued, make Short flights, &c.\r\n\r\nThe large Black & White Pheasant is peculiar to that portion of the\r\nRocky Mountains watered by the Columbia River. at least we did not See\r\nthem untill we reached the waters of that river, nor Since we have left\r\nthose mountains. they are about the Size of a well grown hen. the\r\ncontour of the bird is much that of the redish brown Pheasant common to\r\nour country. the tail is proportionably as long and is composed of 18\r\nfeathers of equal length, of a uniform dark brown tiped with black. the\r\nfeathers of the body are of a dark brown black and white. the black is\r\nthat which most prodomonates, and white feathers are irregularly\r\nintermixed with those of the black and dark brown on every part but in\r\ngreater perpotion about the neck breast and belly. this mixture gives\r\nit very much the appearance of that kind of dunghill fowl, which the\r\nhenwives of our Countrey Call dommanicker. in the brest of Some of\r\nthose birds the white prodominates most. they are not furnished with\r\ntufts of long feathers on the neck as other Pheasants are, but have a\r\nSpace on each Side of the neck about 21/2 inches long and one inch in\r\nwidth on which no feathers grow, tho it is consealed by the feathers\r\nwhich are inserted on the hinder and front part of the neck, this Space\r\nSeams to Serve them to dilate or contract the feathers of the neck with\r\nmore ease. the eye is dark, the beak black, uncovered Somewhat pointed\r\nand the upper exceeds the under chap. they have a narrow Strip of\r\nvermillion colour above each eye which consists of a fleshey Substance\r\nnot protuberant but uneaven, with a number of minute rounded dots. it\r\nhas four toes on each foot of which three are in front, it is booted to\r\nthe toes. it feeds on wild fruits, particularly the berry of the\r\nSac-a-com-mis, and much also on the Seed of the pine & fir. this fowl\r\nis usially found in Small numbers two and three & 4 together on the\r\nground. when Supprised flies up & lights on a tree and is easily Shot\r\ntheir flesh is Superior to most of the Pheasant Species which we have\r\nmet with. they have a gizzard as other Pheasants &c. feed also on the\r\nbuds of the Small Huckleberry bushes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 3, 1806]\r\nMonday March 3rd 1806.\r\nTwo of our perogues have been lately injured very much in consequence\r\nof the tide leaving them partially on shore. they split by this means\r\nwith their own weight. we had them drawn out on shore. our\r\nconvalessents are slowly on the recovery. Lapage is taken sick, gave\r\nhim a doze of Scots pills which did not operate. no movement of the\r\nparty today worthy of notice. every thing moves on in the old way and\r\nwe are counting the days which seperate us from the 1st of April and\r\nwhich bind us to fort Clatsop.--The large black and white pheasant is\r\npeculiar to that portion of the Rocky Mountain watered by the Columbia\r\nriver. at least we did not see them in these mountains until I we\r\nreached the waters of that river nor since we have left those\r\nmountains. they are about the size of a well grown hen. the contour of\r\nthe bird is much that of the redish brown pheasant common to our\r\ncountry. the tail is proportionably as long and is composed of eighteen\r\nfeathers of equal length, of an uniform dark brown tiped with black.\r\nthe feathers of the body are of a dark brown black and white. the black\r\nis that which most predominates, and white feathers are irregularly\r\nintermixed with those of the black and dark brown on every part, but in\r\ngreater proportion about the neck breast and belley. this mixture gives\r\nit very much the appearance of that kind of dunghill fowl which the\r\nhen-wives of our country call dom-manicker. in the brest of some of\r\nthese birds the white predominates most. they are not furnished with\r\ntufts of long feathers on the neck as our pheasants are, but have a\r\nspace on each side of the neck about 21/2 inches long and 1 In. in\r\nwidth on which no feathers grow, tho tis concealed by the feathers\r\nwhich are inserted on the hinder and front part of the neck; this space\r\nseems to surve them to dilate or contract the feathers of the neck with\r\nmore ease. the eye is dark, the beak black, curved somewhat pointed and\r\nthe upper exceeds the under chap. they have a narrow stripe of\r\nvermillion colour above each eye which consists of a fleshey substance\r\nnot protuberant but uneven with a number of minute rounded dots. it has\r\nfour toes on each foot of which three are in front. it is booted to the\r\ntoes. it feeds on wild fruits, particularly the berry of the\r\nsac-a-commis, and much also on the seed of the pine and fir.\r\n\r\nThe small speckled pheasant found in the same country with that above\r\ndiscribed, differs from it only in point of size and somewhat in\r\ncolour. it is scarcely half the size of the other; ascociates in much\r\nlarger flocks and is very gentle. the black is more predominant and the\r\ndark bron feathers less frequent in this than the larger species. the\r\nmixture of white is also more general on every part of this bird. it is\r\nconsiderably smaller than our pheasant and the body reather more round.\r\nin other particulars they differ not at all from the large black and\r\nwhite pheasant. this by way of distinction I have called the speckled\r\npheasant. the flesh of both these species of party coloured phesants is\r\nof a dark colour and with the means we had of cooking them not very\r\nwell flavored.\r\n\r\nThe small brown pheasant is an inhabitant of the same country and is of\r\nthe size and shape of the specled pheasant which it also resembles in\r\nit's economy and habits. the stripe above the eye in this species is\r\nscarcely perceptable, and is when closely examined of a yellow or\r\norrange colour instead of the vermillion of the outhers. it's colour is\r\nan uniform mixture of dark and yellowish brown with a slight mixture of\r\nbrownish white on the breast belley and the feathers underneath the\r\ntail. the whol compound is not unlike that of the common quail only\r\ndarker. this is also booted to the toes. the flesh of this is\r\npreferable to either of the others and that of the breast is as white\r\nas the pheasant of the Atlantic coast.the redish brown pheasant has\r\nbeen previously discribed.--The Crow raven and Large Blackbird are the\r\nsame as those of our country only that the crow is here much smaller\r\nyet it's note is the same. I observe no difference either between the\r\nhawks of this coast and those of the Atlantic. I have observed the\r\nlarge brown hawk, the small or sparrow hawk, and the hawk of an\r\nintermediate size with a long tail and blewish coloured wings\r\nremarkably swift in flight and very firce. sometimes called in the U\r\nStates the hen hawk. these birds seem to be common to every part of\r\nthis country, and the hawks crows & ravens build their nests in great\r\nnumbers along the high and inaccessable clifts of the Columbia river\r\nand it's S. E. branch where we passed along them.--we also met with the\r\nlarge hooting Owl under the Rocky mountain on the Kooskoskee river. it\r\ndid not appear to differ materially from those of our country. I think\r\nit's colours reather deeper and brighter than with us, particularly the\r\nredish brown. it is the same size and form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 3, 1806]\r\nMonday March 3rd 1806\r\nTwo of our Canoes have been lately injured very much in consequence of\r\nthe tide leaveing them partially on Shore. they Split by this means\r\nwith their own weight. we had them drawn out on Shore. our\r\nconvalessents are Slowly on the recovery.

I observe no difference between the Hawk of this Coast and those\r\nof the Atlantic. I have observed the large brown Hawk, the Small or\r\nSparrow hawk, and a hawk of an intermediate Size with a long tail and\r\nblewish coloured wings, remarkably Swift in flight and very ferce.\r\nSometimes called in the Un. States the hen Hawk. those birds Seam to be\r\ncommon to every part of this Country in greater or smaller numbers, and\r\nthe Hawks, Crows, and ravins build their nests in great numbers along\r\nthe high & inaxcessable clifts of the Columbia, and Lewis's rivers when\r\nwe passd along them. we also met with the large hooting Owl under the\r\nRocky mountains on the Kooskooske R. it's Colour reather deeper than\r\nwith us, but differ in no other respect from those of the U States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 4, 1806]\r\nTuesday March 4th 1806.\r\nNot any occurrence today worthy of notice. we live sumptuously on our\r\nwappetoe and Sturgeon. the Anchovey is so delicate that they soon\r\nbecome tainted unless pickled or smoked. the natives run a small stick\r\nthrough their gills and hang them in the smoke of their lodges, or\r\nkindle a small fire under them for the purpose of drying them. they\r\nneed no previous preperation of guting &c and will cure in 24 hours.\r\nthe natives do not appear to be very scrupelous about eating them when\r\na little feated.--the fresh sturgeon they keep for many days by\r\nimmersing it in water. they coock their sturgeon by means of vapor or\r\nsteam. the process is as follows. a brisk fire is kindled on which a\r\nparcel of stones are lad. when the fire birns down and the stones are\r\nsufficiently heated, the stones are so arranged as to form a tolerable\r\nlevel surface, the sturgeon which had been previously cut into large\r\nfletches is now laid on the hot stones; a parsel of small boughs of\r\nbushes is next laid on and a second course of the sturgeon thus\r\nrepating alternate layers of sturgeon and boughs untill the whole is\r\nput on which they design to cook. it is next covered closely with matts\r\nand water is poared in such manner as to run in among the hot stones\r\nand the vapor arrising being confined by the mats, cooks the fish. the\r\nwhole process is performed in an hour, and the sturgeon thus cooked is\r\nmuch better than either boiled or roasted.\r\n\r\nThe turtle dove and robbin are the same of our country and are found as\r\nwell in the plain as open country. the Columbian robbin heretofore\r\ndiscribed seems to be the inhabitant of the woody country exclusively.\r\nthe Magpy is most commonly found in the open country and are the same\r\nwith those formerly discribed on the Missouri. the large woodpecker or\r\nlog cock, the lark woodpeckers and the small white woodpecker with a\r\nread head are the same with those of the Atlantic states and are found\r\nexclusively in the timbered country. The blue crested Corvus and the\r\nsmall white breasted do have been previously discribed and are the\r\nnatives of a piney country invariably, being found as well on the rocky\r\nmountains as on this coast.--the lark is found in the plains only and\r\nare the same with those before mentioned on the Missouri, and not very\r\nunlike what is called in Virginia the old field lark.--The large\r\nbluefish brown or sandhill Crain are found in the valley of the Rocky\r\nmountains in Summer and Autumn where they raise their young, and in the\r\nwinter and begining of spring on this river below tidewater and on this\r\ncoast. they are the same as those common to the Southern and Western\r\nStates where they are most generally known by the name of the Sandhill\r\ncrain. The vulture has also been discribed. there are two species of\r\nthe flycatch, a small redish brown species with a short tail, round\r\nbody, short neck and short pointed beak. they have some fine black\r\nspecks intermixed with the uniform redish brown. this the same with\r\nthat which remains all winter in Virginia where it is sometimes called\r\nthe wren. the second species has lately returned and dose not remain\r\nhere all winter. it's colours are a yellowish brown on the back head\r\nneck wings and tail the breast and belley of a yellowish white; the\r\ntail is in proportion as the wren but it is a size smaller than that\r\nbird. it's beak is streight pointed convex reather lage at the base and\r\nthe chaps of equal length. the first species is the smallest, in short\r\nit is the smalest bird that I have ever seen in America except the\r\nhumming bird. both these species are found in the woody country only or\r\nat least I have never seen them elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 4, 1806]\r\nTuesday March 4th 1806\r\nNot any accurrance to day worthy of notice. we live Sumptiously on our\r\nwappatoe and Sturgeon. the Anchovey is so delicate that they Soon\r\nbecome tainted unless pickled or Smoked. the nativs run a Small Stick\r\nthrough their gills and hang them in the Smoke of their Lodges, or\r\nKindle Small fires under them for the purpose of drying them. they need\r\nno previous preperation of gutting &c. and will Cure in 24 hours. the\r\nnativs do not appear to be very Scrupilous about eating them a little\r\nfeated.\r\n\r\nthe fresh sturgeon they Keep maney days by immersing it in water. they\r\nCook their Sturgeon by means of vapor or Steam. the process is as\r\nfollows. a brisk fire is kindled on which a parcel of Stones are\r\nSufficiently heated, the Stones are So arranged as to form a tolerable\r\nleavel Surface, the Sturgeon which had been previously cut into large\r\nflaetches is now laid on the hot Stones; a parcel of Small boughs of\r\nbushes is next laid on, and a Second course of the Sturgeon thus\r\nrepeating alternate layers of Sturgeon & boughs untill the whole is put\r\non which they design to Cook. it is next covered closely with mats and\r\nwater is poared in Such manner as to run in among the hot Stones, and\r\nthe vapor arriseing being confind by the mats, cooks the fish. the\r\nwhole process is performd in an hour and the Sturgeon thus Cooked is\r\nmuch better than either boiled or roasted. in their usial way of\r\nbolting of other fish in baskets with hot Stones is not so good.\r\n\r\nThe turtle doves and robin are the Same of those of our countrey and\r\nare found as well as the plains as open countrey. the Columbia robin\r\nheretofore discribed Seams to be the inhabitent of the woody Country\r\nexclusively. the magpye is most commonly found in the open Country and\r\nare the Same with those formerly discribed on the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe large wood pecker or log cock the lark woodpecker and the common\r\nwood pecker with a red head are the Same with those of the Atlantic\r\nStates, and are found exclusively in the timbered Country. The Blue\r\ncrested Corvus and the Small white brested corvus are the nativs of a\r\npiney country invariably, being found as well on the Rocky Mountains as\r\non this coast-. The lark is found in the plains only and are the Same\r\nwith those on the Missouri and the Illinois and not unlike what is\r\nCalled in Virginia the old field Lark.\r\n\r\nThe large bluish brown or Sandhill Crain are found in the Vally's of\r\nthe Rocky Mountain in Summer and autumn when they raise their young and\r\nin the winter and beginning of Spring on this river below tide water\r\nand on this coast. they are the Same as those Common to the Southern\r\nand Western States where they are most generally known by the name of\r\nthe Sand hill Crain. The Vulture has already been discribed.\r\n\r\nThere are two Species of fly Catch, a Small redish brown with a Short\r\ntail, round body, Short neck, and Short pointed beak, and the Same as\r\nthat with us sometimes called the Wren. the 2d Species does not remain\r\nall winter they have just returned and are of a Yellowish brown Colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 5, 1806]\r\nWednesday March 5th 1806.\r\nThis morning we were visited by two parties of Clatsops. they brought\r\nsome fish a hat and some skins for sale most of which we purchased.\r\nthey returned to their village in the evening. late in the evening the\r\nhunters returned from the kil-haw-a-nack-kle River which discharges\r\nitself into the head of the bay. They had neither killed nor seen any\r\nElk. they informed us that the Elk had all gone off to the mountains a\r\nconsiderable distance from us. this is unwelcome information and\r\nreather allarming we have only 2 days provision on hand, and that\r\nnearly spoiled. we made up a small assortment of articles to trade with\r\nthe Indians and directed Sergt. Pryor to set out early in the morning\r\nin a canoe with 2 men, to ascend the Columbia to the resort of the\r\nIndian fishermen and purchase some fish; we also directed two parties\r\nof hunters to renew the Chase tomorrow early. the one up the Netul and\r\nthe other towards Point Adams. if we find that the Elk have left us, we\r\nhave determined to ascend the river slowly and indeavour to procure\r\nsubsistence on the way, consuming the Month of March in the woody\r\ncountry. earlyer than April we conceive it a folly to attempt the open\r\nplains where we know there is no fuel except a few small dry shrubs. we\r\nshall not leave our quarters at fort Clatsop untill the first of April,\r\nas we intended unless the want of subsistence compels us to that\r\nmeasure. The common snipe of the marshes and the small sand snipe are\r\nthe same of those common to the Atlantic Coast tho the former are by no\r\nmeans as abundant here. the prarrow of the woody country is also\r\nsimilar to ours but not abundant. those of the plains of Columbia are\r\nthe same with those of the Missouri, tho they are by no means so\r\nabundant. I have not seen the little singing lark or the large brown\r\nCurloo so common to the plains of the Missouri, but I beleive that the\r\nlatter is an inhabitant of this country during summer from Indian\r\ninformation. I have no doubt but what many species of birds found here\r\nin Autumn and Summer had departed before our arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 5, 1806]\r\nWednesday March 5th 1806.\r\nThis morning we were visited by two parties of Clatsops they brought\r\nSome fish, a hat and Some Skins for Sale most of which we purchased,\r\nthey returned to their Village in the evening with the returning tide.\r\nlate in the evening the Hunters returned from the Kil-haw-d nack-kle\r\nRiver which discharges itself into the head of the Bay. They had\r\nneither killed nor Seen any Elk. they informed us that the Elk had all\r\ngorn off to the mountains a considerable distance from us. this is\r\nunwelcom information and reather alarming. we have only two days\r\nprovisions on hand and that nearly Spoiled. we made up a Small\r\nassortment of Articles to trade with the Indians, and directed Sergt\r\nNatl.

If we find that the Elk have left us, we have determined to\r\nassend the river slowly and endeaver to precure Subsistance on the way,\r\nConsumeing the month of March in the woody Country, earlyer than april\r\nwe conceive it a folly to attempt the Open plains where we know there\r\nis no fuel except a fiew Small dry Shrubs. we Shall not leave our\r\nquarters at Fort Clatsop untill the 1st of April as we intended, unless\r\nthe want of Subsistance compels us to that measure.\r\n\r\nThe common Snipe of the marshes and the Small sand snipe are the same\r\nof those Common to the atlantic coast tho the former are by no means as\r\nabundant here.\r\n\r\nThe Sparrow of the woody country is also Similar to ours but not\r\nabundant. those of the plains of Columbia are the Same with those of\r\nthe Missouri. tho they are by no means So Abundant. I have not Seen the\r\nlittle Singing lark or the large brown Curloe So Common to the Plains\r\nof the Missouri. but believe the Curloe is an inhabitent of this\r\nCountrey dureing Summer from Indian information and their attemps to\r\nmimick the notes of this fowl. I have no doubt but what maney Species\r\nof birds found here in autumn and Summer had departed before our\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nThe Aquatic Birds of this country or such as obtain their Subsistence\r\nfrom the water, are the large blue and brown heron, fishing Hawk, blue\r\ncrested fisher, Gulls of Several Species of the Coast, the large grey\r\nGull of the Columbia, Comorant, loons of two Species, white and the\r\nbrown brant, Small and large Geese, small and large Swans, the\r\nDuckinmallard, canvis back Duck, red headed fishing Duck, black and\r\nwhite duck, little brown Duck, Black Duck, two Species of Divers, blue\r\nwinged teal, 14 and Some other Species of Ducks, two Species of Plevers.\r\n\r\nThe hunters who were out last informed me that they discovered a very\r\nConsiderable fall in the Kit-haw-a-nack-kle River on its main western\r\nfork at which place it falls abt. 100 feet from the Side of a mountain\r\nS.

The Fishing Hawk with the Crown of the head white, and\r\nback of a milkey white, and the blue crested or king fisher are found\r\non every part of the Columbia and its water Along which we passed and\r\nare the Same with those of the U, States. the fishing hawk is not\r\nabundant, particularly in the mountains. There are 4 Species of the\r\nlarus or gull on this coast and river. 1st a Small Species the Size of\r\na Pegion; white except some black spots about the head and the little\r\nbone on the but of the wing. 2d a Species Somewhat larger of a light\r\nbrown colour, with a mealy coloured back. 3rd the large Grey Gull, or\r\nwhite larus with a greyish brown back, and light grey belly and breast,\r\nabout the Size of a well grown pullet, the wings are remarkably long in\r\nperpotion to the Size of the body and it's under chap towards the\r\nextremity is gibbous and protuberant than in either of the other\r\nSpecies. a White Gull about the Size of the Second with a remarkable\r\nbeak; adjoining the head and on the base of the upper Chap there is an\r\nelivated orning of the Same Substance with the beak which forms the\r\nnostriels at A; it is Somewhat in this form. the feet are webed and the\r\nlegs and feet of a yellow colour. the form of the wings body &c are\r\nmuch that of the 2d Species this bird was Seen on Haleys bay.\r\n\r\nThe large Grey Gull is found on the Columbian waters as high as the\r\nenterence of the Koos koos ke and in common with the other Species on\r\nthe coast; the others appear confined to the tidewater, and the 4th\r\nSpecies not So common as either of the others. The Comorant is a large\r\nblack duck which feeds on fish; I proceive no difference between it &\r\nthese found in the rivers of the Atlantic Coasts. we met with as high\r\nup the river as the enterance of the Chopunnish into the Kooskooske\r\nriver. they increased in numbers as we decended, and formed much the\r\nGreatest portion of waterfowls which we saw on the Columbia untill we\r\nreached tidewater, where they also abound but do not bear a Similar\r\nproportion to the fowls found in this quarter. we found this bird fat\r\nand tolerably flavoured as we decended the Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 7, 1806]\r\nFriday March 7th 1806.\r\nThe wind was so high that Comowol did not leave us untill late this\r\nevening. Labuish and Drewyer returned at sunset having killed one Elk\r\nonly. they report that there are some scattering male Elk in the\r\nneighbourhood of the place they killed this one or about 5 miles up the\r\nNetul on this side.--Bratton is much wose today, he complains of a\r\nviolent pain in the small of his back and is unable in consequence to\r\nset up. we gave him one of our flanel shirts, applyed a bandage of\r\nflannel to the part and bathed and rubed it well with some vollatile\r\nlinniment which I prepared with sperits of wine, camphor, castile soap\r\nand a little laudinum. he felt himself better in the evening.--the\r\nlarge blue and brown herons, or Crams as they are usually called in the\r\nU States are found on this river below tidewater. they are the same\r\nwith those of the U States. the fishing hawk with the crown of the head\r\nWhite and back of a mealy white, and the blue crested or King fisher\r\nare found on every part of the Columbia and it's waters and are the\r\nsame with those of the U States. the fishing hawk is not abundant\r\nparticularly in the mountains. there are four speceis of larus or gull\r\non this coast and river, 1st a small speceis about the size of a\r\npigeon; white except some black spots about the head and a little brown\r\non the but of the wings, 2nd a speceis somewhat larger of a light brown\r\ncolour with a whitish or mealy coloured back. 3rd the large grey gull,\r\nor white larus with a greyish brown back and a light grey belley and\r\nbreast, about the size of a well grown pullet or reather larger. the\r\nwings are remarkably long in proportion to the size of the body and\r\nit's under chap towards the extremity is more gibbous and protuberant\r\nthan in either of the other speceis. 4th a white gull about the size of\r\nthe second with a remarkable beak; adjoining the head and at the base\r\nof the uper Chap there is an elivated orning of the same substance with\r\nthe beak which forms the nostrils; it is some what in this forma the\r\nfeet are webbed and the legs and feet of a yellow colour. the form of\r\nthe wings body &c are much that of the second species. the large grey\r\ngull is found on the river as high as the entrance of the Kooskooske\r\nand in common with the other speceis on the coast; the others appear to\r\nbe confined to tidewater; and the fourth speceis not so common as\r\neither of the others. the cormorant is a large black duck which feeds\r\non fish; I perceive no difference between it and those found in the\r\nPotomac and other rivers on the Atlantic Coast. tho I do not recollect\r\nseeing those on the atlantic so high up the rivers as those are found\r\nhere. we first met with them on the Kooskooske at the entrance of\r\nChopunnish river. they increased in quantity as we decended, and formed\r\nmuch the greatest portion of the waterfowl which we saw on the Columbia\r\nuntill we reached tidewater where they also abound but do not bear a\r\nsimilar proportion to the other fowls found in this quarter.\r\n\r\nThere are two speceis of loons. 1st the Speckled loon found on every\r\npart of the rivers of this country. they are the same size colours and\r\nform with those of the Atlantic coast. the second speceis we first met\r\nwith at the great falls of the Columbia and from thence down. this bird\r\nis not more than half the size of the speckled loon, it's neck is long,\r\nslender and white in front. the Colour of the body and back of the neck\r\nand head are of a dun or ash colour, the breast and belley are white.\r\nthe beak is like that of the speckled loon and like them it cannot fly\r\nbut flutters along on the top of the warter or dives for security when\r\npursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 7, 1806]\r\nFriday March 7th 1806\r\nThe wind was So high that Comowol did not leave us untill late this\r\nevening. Drewyer & Labiesh returned at Sunset haveing killed one Elk\r\nonly. they report that there are Some Scattering mail Elk in the\r\nneighbourhood of the place they killed this one or about 5 miles up the\r\nNetul river on the west Side-. Bratten is much worst to day he\r\ncomplains of a violent pain in the Small of his back, and is unable in\r\nconsequence of it to Set up. we gave him one of our flanel Shirts. I\r\napplied a bandage of flanel to the part and rubed it well with Some\r\nvolatile linniment which was prepared with Sperits of wine, camphire,\r\nSastile Soap, and a little laudinum. he felt himself better in the\r\nevening at which time I repeated the linnement and bathed his feet to\r\nrestore circulation which he complaind of in that part.\r\n\r\nThere are two Species of Loons. 1st the Speckled loon found on every\r\npart of the rivers of this quarter, they are the Same Size Colour and\r\nform with those of the Ohio, and atlantic coasts. the 2d Species we\r\nfirst met with at the great falls of the Columbia and from thence down.\r\nthis bird is not more than half the Size of the Speckled loon, it's\r\nneck is long, Slender and white in front. the colour of the body and\r\nback of the neck and head are of a dun or ash Colour, the breast and\r\nbelly are white. the back is like that of the Speckled loon, and like\r\nthem it cannot fly, but flutters along on the top of the water or Dives\r\nfor Security when pursued.\r\n\r\nJohn Shields Reubin Fields & Robert frasure measured 2 trees of the fur\r\nkind one 37 feet around, appears sound, has but fiew limbs for 200 feet\r\nit is East of the Netul abt 280 feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 8, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 8th 1806.\r\nBratton is much better today, his back gives him but little pain.\r\nCollins returned early in the morning and informed us that he had\r\nkilled three Elk about five miles distant on the edge of the prarie in\r\nPoint Adams. one of them fell in a deep pond of water and could not get\r\nit, the other two he butcherd and secured. he saw two large herds of\r\nElk in that quarter. we sent Drewyer and Joseph Fields to hunt those\r\nElk. a party were also sent with Labuish for the flesh of the Elk which\r\nDrewyer and himself had killed up the netul, they returned with it in\r\nthe evening. Shields, R. Fields and Frazier returned this evening from\r\nthe Kilhawanackkle unsuccessfull having seen no Elk. McNeal and\r\nGoodrich having recovered from the Louis veneri I directed them to\r\ndesist from the uce of mercury. The white brant is very common in this\r\ncountry particularly below tidewater where they remain in vast\r\nquantities during the winter. they feed like the swan gees &c on the\r\ngrass roots and seeds which they find in the marshes. this bird is\r\nabout the size of the brown brant or a third less than the common\r\nCanadian or wild goose. the head is proportionably with the goose\r\nreather large; the beak also thicker shorter and of much the same form,\r\nbeing of a yellowish white colour except the edges of the chaps, which\r\nare frequently of a dark brown. the legs and feet are of the same form\r\nof the goose and are of a redish white or pale flesh colour. the tail\r\nis composed of sixteen feathers of equal length as those of the geese\r\nand brown brant are and bears about the same proportion in point of\r\nlength. the eye is of a dark colour and nothing remarkable as to size.\r\nthe wings are rether longer compared with those of the goose but not as\r\nmuch so as in the brown or pided brant. the colour of the plumage of\r\nthis bird is unifomly a pure white except the large feathers of the\r\nextremities of the wings which are black. the large feathers of the 1st\r\njoint of the wing next to the body are white. the note of this bird\r\ndiffers essentially from that of the goose; it more resembles that of\r\nthe brown brant but is somewhat different. it is like the note of young\r\ndomestic goose which has not perfectly attained it's full note. the\r\nflesh of this bird is exceedingly fine, preferable to either the goose\r\nor pided brant.--The Brown or pided brant are much the same size and\r\nform of the white only that their wings are considerably longer and\r\nmore pointed. the plumage of the upper part of the body neck head and\r\ntail is much the colour of the canadian goose but reather darker in\r\nconsequence of som dark brown feathers which are distributed and\r\nirregularly scattered throughout. they have not the white on the neck\r\nand sides of the head as the goose has nor is the neck darker than the\r\nbody. like the goose there are some white feathers on the rump at the\r\njoining of the tail. the beak is dark and the legs and feet also dark\r\nwith a greenish cast; the breast and belley are of a lighter colour\r\nthan the back and is also irregularly intermixed with dark brown and\r\nblack feathers which give it a pided appearance. the flesh of this bird\r\nis dark and in my estimation reather better than that of the goose. the\r\nhabits of this bird are the same nearly with the goose and white brant\r\nwith this difference that they do not remain in this climate in such\r\nnumbers during the winter as the others, and that it sets out earlier\r\nin the fall season on it's return to the south and arrives later in the\r\nspring than the goose. I see no difference between this bird and that\r\ncalled simply the brant, common to the lakes the Ohio and Mississippi\r\n&c. The small goose of this country is reather less than the brant;\r\nit's head and neck like the brant are reather larger than that of the\r\ngoose in proportion; their beak is also thicker and shorter. their\r\nnotes are more like those of our tame gees; in all other rispects they\r\nare the same with the large goose with which, they so frequently\r\nascociate that it was some time after I first observed this goose\r\nbefore I could determine whether it was a distinct speceis or not. I\r\nhave now no hesitation in declaring them a distinct speceis. the large\r\ngoose is the same of that common on the Atlantic coast, and known by\r\nthe appellation of the wild, or Canadian goose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 8, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 8th 1806\r\nBratten is much better this morning, his back givs him but little pain.\r\nCollins returned early in the morning, and informed us that he had\r\nkilled three Elk about five miles distance on the edge of the prarie in\r\npoint Adams. one of them fell in a deep pond of water and he could not\r\ngit to it. the other two he butchered and Saved. he saw two large herds\r\nof Elk in that quarter. we Sent Drewyer & Jos.

Field and Frasure returned this evening from\r\nthe Kilhawanackkle unsuccessfull haveing Seen no Elk. McNeal and\r\nGoodrich haveing recovered from the Louis veneri I detected them to\r\ndesist from takeing the murcury or useing in future. willard is yet\r\ncomplaining and is low Spirited.\r\n\r\nThe White Brant is very common in this country particularly below tide\r\nwater where they remain in vast quantities dureing the winter. they\r\nfeed like the Swan Goose &c. on the grass and roots & Seeds which they\r\nfind in the marshes this bird is a little larger than the brown brant\r\nand a fourth less than the common wild or Canadian goose. the head is\r\nproportionably with the goose reather large; the beak thicker Shorter\r\nand of the Same form, being of a yellowish white colour except the\r\nedges of the Chaps, which are frequently of a dark brown. the legs and\r\nfeet are of the Same form of the goose and are of a redish white or\r\npail flesh colour. the tail is composed of Sixteen feathers of equal\r\nlength as those of the geese and brown brant are, and bears about the\r\nSame perpotion in point of length. the Eye is of a dark colour and\r\nnothing remarkable as to Size. the wings are reather longer compared\r\nwith those of the goose, but not as much So as is the brown or pieded\r\nbrant. the colour of the plumage of this bird is uniformly a pure white\r\nexcept the large feathers of the extremities of the wings which are\r\nblack. The large feathers of the 1st joint of the wing next to the body\r\nare white. the note of this bird differs essentially from that of the\r\ngoose; it more resembles that of the brown brant but is Somewhat\r\ndifferent. it is like the note of a young domestic goose which has not\r\nperfectly attained its full note. the flesh of this bird is exceedingly\r\nfine, prefferable to either the goose or pieded brant. the neck is\r\nShorter in prpotion than that of the goose.\r\n\r\nThe Brown or pieded brant are nearly the Size and much the Same form of\r\nthe white brante only that their wings are considerably longer and more\r\npointed. the plumage of the upper part of the body, neck, head and tail\r\nis much the Colour of the Common or Canadian Goose but rather darker in\r\nconsequence of Some dark brown feathers which are distributed and\r\nirregularly scattered throughout. they have not the white on the neck\r\nand Sides of the head as the goose has nor is the neck darker than the\r\nbody. like the goose there are Some white feathers on the rump at the\r\njunction of the tail. the beak, legs and feet are dark, with a greenish\r\ncast; the breast and belly are of a lighter colour than the back and is\r\nalso intermixed, irregularly, with dark brown and black feathers which\r\ngives it a pieded appearance. the flesh of this bird is dark, and in my\r\nestimation reather better than that of the goose. the habits of this\r\nbird is nearly the same with the goose and white brant, with this\r\ndifference that they do not remain in this Climate in Such numbers\r\ndureing the winter as the others. I See no difference between this bird\r\nand that Called Simpilly the Brant Common to the Lakes and frequently\r\nSeen on the Ohio and Mississippi in large flocks &c.\r\n\r\nThe Small Goose of this country is reather less than the Brant; it's\r\nhead and neck like the brant are reather larger than that of the goose\r\nin purpotion; their beak is also thicker and Shorter. their notes are\r\nmore like those of our taim geese, in all other respect they are the\r\nSame with the large Goose with which, they So frequently ascoiete, that\r\nit was Some time after I first observed this goose before I could\r\nwhether it was a distinct Speces or not. I have no hesitation now in\r\ndeclareing them a distinct Species. the large Goose is the Same as that\r\ncommon to the Ohio, and atlantic coast, and known by the appellation of\r\nthe wild, or Canadian Goose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 9, 1806]\r\nSunday March 9th 1806. This morning the men set out at daylight to go\r\nin gust of the Elk which Collins had killed, they returned with it at\r\neleven A.M. Bratton complains of his back being very painfull to him\r\ntoday; I conceive this pain to be something of the rheumatism. we still\r\napply the linniment and flannel; in the evening he was much better.\r\nDrewyer and Joseph Fields returned not having found any Elk. Sergt.\r\nPryor and the fishing party not yet arrived, suppose they are detained\r\nby the winds. visited by 3 Clatsop men who brought a dog some fish and\r\na Sea Otter skin for sale. we suffered them to remain all night. we set\r\nShields at work to make some sacks of Elk skin to contain various\r\narticles. The large Swan is precisely the same common to the Atlantic\r\nStates. the small swan differs only from the larger one in size and\r\nit's note. it is about one fourth less and it's note entirely\r\ndifferent. the latter cannot be justly immetated by the sound of\r\nletters nor do I know any sounds with which a comparison would be\r\npertinent. it begins with a kind of whistleing sound and terminates in\r\na round full note which is reather louder than the whistleing, or\r\nformer part; this note is as loud as that of the large swan. from the\r\npeculiar whistleing of the note of this bird I have called it the\r\nwhistleing swan it's habits colour and contour appear to be precisely\r\nthose of the large Swan. we first saw them below the great narrows of\r\nthe Columbia near the Chilluckkittequaw nation. They are very abundant\r\nin this neighbourhood and have remained with us all winter. in number\r\nthey are fully five for one of the large speceis. The duckinmallard or\r\ncommon large duck wich resembles the domestic duck are the same here\r\nwith those of the U Sts. they are abundant and are found on every part\r\nof the river below the mountains. they remain here all winter but I\r\nbeleive they do not continue during winter far above tidewater. a\r\nbeautifull duck and one of the most delicious in the world is found in\r\nconsiderable quantities in this neighbourhood during the Autumn and\r\nwinter. this is the same with that known in the Delliware,\r\nSusquehannah, and Potomac by the name of the Canvisback and in James\r\nRiver by that of shell-Drake; in the latter river; however I am\r\ninformed that they have latterly almost entirely disappeared. to the\r\nepicure of those parts of the union where this duck abounds nothing\r\nneed be added in praise of the exqusite flavor of this duck. I have\r\nfrequently eaten of them in several parts of the Union and I think\r\nthose of the Columbia equally as delicious. this duck is never found\r\nabove tide-water; we did not meet with them untill after we reached the\r\nmarshey Islands; and I beleive that they have already left this\r\nneighbourhood, but whether they have gone northwardly or Southwardly I\r\nam unable to determin; nor do I know in what part of the Continent they\r\nraise their young.--The read headed fishing duck is common to every\r\npart of the river and are found as well in the Rocky Mountains as\r\nelsewhere; in short this was the only duck we saw on the waters of the\r\nColumbia within the mountains. they feed principally on crawfish and\r\nare the same in every rispect as those on the rivers in the mountains\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 9, 1806]\r\nSunday Mach 9th 1806\r\nThis morning the men Set out at day light to go in quest of the Elk\r\nwhich Collins had killed, they returned at 11 A.M. Bratten complains of\r\nhis backs being very painfull to him to day. we Still apply the\r\nlinnement & flannel; in the evening he was much better. Jos. Field &\r\nDrewyer returned not haveing found any Elk. Sergt. Pryor and the\r\nfishing party not yet returned, Suppose they are detained by the winds.\r\nwe are visited by 3 Clatsop men who brought a Dog, Some fish and a Sea\r\notter Skin for Sale. we Suffered them to remain all night. we Set\r\nShields at work to make Some Sacks of Elk Skin to contain my papers,\r\nand various articles which we wish kept Dry.\r\n\r\nThe large Swan is precisely the Same Common to the Missouri,\r\nMississippi and the Atlantic States &c. The Small Swan differ only from\r\nthe large one in Size and it's note. it is about 1/4th less, and its\r\nnotes entirely different. the latter cannot be justly immetated by the\r\nSound of letters nor do I know any Sound with which a comparison would\r\nbe perti-nent. it begins with a kind of whistling Sound and terminates\r\nin a round full note which is reather louder than the whistling, or\r\nformer part; this note is as loud as that of the large Swan. from the\r\npeculiar whistling of the note of this bird I have Called it the\r\nWhistleing Swan. it's habits colour and contour appear to be precisely\r\nthose of the large swan. we first saw them below the great narrows of\r\nthe Columbia near the Chilluckkittequaw Nation. they are very abundant\r\nin this neighbourhood and have remained with us all winter. in number\r\nthey are fully five for one of the large Species of the Swan's.\r\n\r\nThe Duckinmallard are the Same here with those of the U, States. they\r\nare abundant and are found on every part of the river below the\r\nmountains. they remain here all winter, but I believe they do not\r\nremain all winter above tide water.--a butifull Duck and one of the\r\nmost delicious in the world is found in Considerable quantities in this\r\nneighbourhood dureing the Autumn and winter. this is the Same as that\r\nknown in the Dilliwar, Susquehannah and Potomac by the name of the\r\nCanvisback and James River by that of Shell-Drake; in the latter river\r\nI am informed that they have latterly almost entirely disapeared. the\r\nepicures of those parts of the Union where those Ducks abound nothing\r\nneed be added in prais of the exquisit flavor of this duck. I have\r\neaten of them in Several parts of the Union and I think those of the\r\nColumbia equally as delicious. this duck is never found above tide\r\nwater; we did not meat with them untill after we reached the marshey\r\nIslands; and I believe that they have already left this neighbourhood;\r\nbut whether they are gorn Northerly or Southerly, I am unable to\r\ndeturmine; nor do I know in what part of the Country they rais their\r\nyoung\r\n\r\nThe red headed fishing duck is common to every part of the river and\r\nare found as well in the Rocky Mountains as elsewhere; in short this\r\nwas the only duck we Saw within the Mountain on the Columbian waters.\r\nthey feed principally on Crawfish; and are the Same in every respects\r\nas those on the Ohio and rivers in the mountains of the atlantic Ocian.\r\n\r\nThe black and white Duck are Small about the Size of the blue-winged\r\nteal, or reather larger. the mail is butifully varigated with black and\r\nwhite. the white occupies the Side of the head, breast and back. black\r\nthe tail, large feathers of the wing, two tufts of feathers which cover\r\nthe upper part of the wings when folded, the neck and head. the female\r\nis darker or has much less white about her. I take this to be the Same\r\nSpecies of duck common to the ohio, as also the atlantic Coast, and\r\nSometimes called the butter box. the back is wide and Short, and as\r\nwell as the legs of a dark Colour. the flesh of this duck is verry well\r\nflavored I think Superior to the Duckinmallard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 10, 1806]\r\nMonday March 10th 1806.\r\nAbout 1 P.M. it became fair and we sent out two parties of hunters on\r\nthis side of the Netul the one below and the other above. we also\r\ndirected a party to set out early in the morning and pass the bay and\r\nhunt beyond the Kilhowanackkle. from the last we have considerable hope\r\nas we have as yet hunted but little in that quarter. it blew hard all\r\nday. in the evening the Indians departed. The hunters who were over the\r\nNetull the other day informed us that they measured a pine tree, (or\r\nfir No 1) which at the hight of a man's breast was 42 feet in the girth\r\nabout three feet higher, or as high as a tall man could reach, it was\r\n40 feet in the girth which was about the circumpherence for at least\r\n200 feet without a limb, and that it was very lofty above the\r\ncommencement of the limbs. from the appearance of other trees of this\r\nspeceis of fir and their account of this tree, I think it may be safely\r\nestimated at 300 feet. it had every appearance of being perfectly\r\nsound. The black and white duck are small abut the size of the\r\nblue-winged teal, or reather larger. the male is beautifully variagated\r\nwith black and white. the white occupys the sides of the head, breast\r\nand back, black, the tail feathers of the wings two tufts of feathers\r\nwhich cover the upper part of the wings when foalded, the neck and\r\nhead. the female is darker or has much less white about her. I take\r\nthis to be the same speceis of duck common to the Atlantic coast, and\r\nfrequently called the butterbox. the beak is wide and short, and as\r\nwell as the legs, of a dark colour. the flesh of this duck is very well\r\nflavored. the brown duck is much in form like the duckinmallard, tho\r\nnot much more than half it's size. the colour is an uniform mixture of\r\nyellowish and dark brown. there is nothing remarkable in the appearance\r\nof this duck it generally resorts the same kind of grassey marshes with\r\nthe duckinmallard and feeds in a similar manner, on grass seed, and\r\nroots. both these ducks are common to the river for some distance above\r\ntide water as well as below. The black duck is about the size of the\r\nbluewinged teal. their colour is a duskey black the breast and belley\r\nsomewhat lighter than the other parts, or a dark brown. the legs stand\r\nlongitudinally with the body, and the bird when on shore stands of\r\ncours very erect. the legs and feet are of a dark brown, the toes are\r\nfour on each foot, a short one at the heel and three long toes in\r\nfront, which are unconnected with a web. the webs are attatched to each\r\nsides of the several joints of the toe, and divided by deep sinuses at\r\neach joint. the web assuming in the intermediate part an eliptical\r\nfigure. the beak is about two inches long, streight, flated on the\r\nsides, and tapering to a sharp point. the upper chap somewhat longest,\r\nand bears on it's base at the joining of the head, a little conic\r\nprotuberance of a cartelagenous substace, being redish brown at the\r\npoint. the beak is of an ivory white colour. the eye dark. these ducks\r\nusually associate in large flocks, and are very noisey; their note\r\nbeing a sharp shrill whistle. they are usually fat and agreeably\r\nflavored; and feed principally on moss, and other vegitable productions\r\nof the water. we did not meet with them untill we reached tide-water,\r\nbut I beleive them not exclusively confined to that district at all\r\nseasons, as I have noticed the same duck on many parts of the Rivers\r\nOhio and Mississippi. the gizzard and liver are also remarkably large\r\nin this fowl. the divers are the same with those of the Atlantic\r\nStates. the smaller species has some white feathers about the rump with\r\nno perceptable tail and is very active and cluck in it's motion; the\r\nbody is of a redish brown. the beak sharp and somewhat curved like that\r\nof the pheasant. the toes are not connected but webed like those\r\ndiscribed of the black duck. the larger speceis are about the size of\r\nthe teal and can flye a short distance which the small one scarcely\r\never attapts. they have a short tail. their colour is also an uniform\r\nbrickredish brown, the beak is streight and pointed. the feet are of\r\nthe same form of the other speceis and the legs are remarkably thin and\r\nflat one edge being in front. the food of both speceis is fish, and the\r\nflesh unfit for uce. the bluewinged teal are a very excellent duck, and\r\nare the same with those of the Atlantic coast.--There are some other\r\nspeceis of ducks which shall be hereafter discribed as I may hereafter\r\nhave an opportunity to examine them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 10, 1806]\r\nMonday March 10th 1806\r\nabout 1 P.M. it became fair and we Sent out two parties of hunters on\r\nthis Side of the Netul, one above and the other below, we also derected\r\na party to Set out early in the morning and pass Meriwethers Bay and\r\nhunt beyond the Kilhow anak kle. from the last we have considerable\r\nhope, as we have as yet hunted but little in that quarter. it blew hard\r\nall day, in the evening the Indians departed. The Hunters, S. R. F. &\r\nF. who were over the netul the other day informed us that they measured\r\na 2d tree of the fir Speces (No. i) as high as a man Could reach, was\r\n39 feet in the girth; it tapered but very little for about 200 feet\r\nwithout any Considerable limbs, and that it was a very lofty above the\r\nCommmencement of the limbs. from the appearance of other Species of\r\nfir, and their account of this tree, I think it might safely estimated\r\nat 300 feet. it had every appearance of being perfectly Sound in every\r\npart\r\n\r\nThe brown Duck is much in form like the Duckinmallard, tho not much\r\nmore than half it's Size. the colour is one uniform mixture of\r\nyellowish and dark brown. there is nothing remarkable in the colour of\r\nthis duck; it resorts the Same kind of grassy marshes with the\r\nDuckinmallard, and feeds in a Similar manner, on grass, Seeds & roots.\r\nboth these ducks are common to the river for Some distance above tide\r\nwater as well as below. The black Duck is about the Size of the\r\nbluewinged teel. their colour is a duskey black the breast and belly\r\nSomewhat lighter than the other parts, or a dark brown. the legs Stand\r\nlongitudianally with the body, and the Bird when on Shore Stands very\r\nerect. the legs and feet are of a dark brown, the toes are four on each\r\nfoot, a short one on the heel and three long toes in front which are\r\nunconnected with a web. the web is atached to each Side of the Several\r\njoints of the toes, and devided by deep Sinuses at each joint. the web\r\nassumeing in the intermediate part an elipticle figure. the beak is\r\nabout two inches long, Streight, flated on the Sides, and tapering to a\r\nSharp point. the upper chap Somewhat longest and bears on its base at\r\nthe joining of the head, a little conic protuberance of a cartelagenous\r\nSubstance, being redish brown. the beak is of a ivery white colour. the\r\neye dark. these ducks usially associate in large flocks, and are very\r\nnoisey; their note being a Sharp shrill whistle. they are usially fat\r\nand tolerably flavoured; and feed on moss and other vegitable\r\nproductions of the water. we did not meet with them untill we reached\r\ntide water, I have noticed the Same duck on maney parts of the ohio an\r\nMississippi. the Gizzard and liver are also remarkably large in this\r\nfowl-. The Divers are the Same with those of the atlantic States. the\r\nSmaller Species has some white feathers about the rump and no\r\nperceptable tail and is very active and quick in its motion; the body\r\nis of a redish brown. the beak sharp and Somewhat curved like that of\r\nthe Pheasant the toes are not connected but webd. like those discribed\r\nof the black duck.

Drewyer Joseph Fields\r\nand Frazier set out by light this morning to pass the bay in order to\r\nhunt as they had been directed the last evening. we once more live in\r\nclover; Anchovies fresh Sturgeon and Wappetoe. the latter Sergt. Pryor\r\nhad also procured and brought with him. The reptiles of this country\r\nare the rattlesnake garter snake and the common brown Lizzard. The\r\nseason was so far advanced when we arrived on this side of the rocky\r\nmountains that but few rattlesnakes were seen I did not remark one\r\nparticularly myself, nor do I know whether they are of either of the\r\nfour speceis found in the different parts of the United states, or of\r\nthat species before mentioned peculiar to the upper parts of the\r\nMissouri and it's branches. The garter snake so called in the United\r\nStates is very common in this country; they are found in great numbers\r\non the open and sometimes marshey grounds in this neighbourhood. they\r\ndiffer not at all from those of the U States. the black or dark brown\r\nlizzard we saw at the rock fort Camp at the commencement of the woody\r\ncountry below the great narrows and falls of the Columbia; they are\r\nalso the same with those of the United States. The snail is numerous in\r\nthe woody country on this coast; they are in shape like those of the\r\nUnited States, but are at least five times their bulk. There is a\r\nspeceis of water lizzard of which I saw one only just above the grand\r\nrapids of the Columbia. it is about 9 inches long the body is reather\r\nflat and about the size of a mans finger covered with a soft skin of a\r\ndark brown colour with an uneven surface covered with little pimples\r\nthe neck and head are short, the latter terminating in an accute\r\nangular point and flat. the fore feet each four toes, the hinder ones\r\nfive unconnected with a web and destitute of tallons. it's tail was\r\nreather longer than the body and in form like that of the Musk-rat,\r\nfirst rising in an arch higher than the back and decending lower than\r\nthe body at the extremity, and flated perpendicularly. the belley and\r\nunder part of the neck and head were of a brick red every other part of\r\nthe colour of the upper part of the body a dark brown. the mouth was\r\nsmooth, without teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 11, 1806]\r\nTuesday March 11th 1806\r\nEarly this morning Sergt.

Drewyer Jo. Field & Frazier\r\nSet out by light this morning to pass the bay in order to hunt as they\r\nhad been directed last evening. we once more live in Clover; Anchovies\r\nfresh Sturgeon and Wappatoe. the latter Sergt. Pryor had also procured\r\na fiew and brought with him. The Deer of this Coust differ from the\r\nCommon Deer, fallow Deer or Mule Deer as has beformentiond.\r\n\r\nThe Mule Deer we have never found except in rough Country; they prefer\r\nthe Open Grounds and are Seldom found in the wood lands near the river;\r\nwhen they are met with in the wood lands or river bottoms and pursued,\r\nthey imediately run to the hills or open country as the Elk do, the\r\nContrary happens with the common Deer. there are Several differences\r\nbetween the mule and common deer as well as in form as in habits. they\r\nare fully a third larger in general, and the male is particularly\r\nlarge; think there is Somewhat greater disparity of Size between the\r\nMale and the female of this Species than there is between the male and\r\nfemale fallow Deer; I am Convinced I have Seen a Buck of this Species\r\ntwice the volume a Buck of the Common Deer. the Ears are peculiarly\r\nlarge, I measured those of a large Buck which I found to be eleven\r\ninches long and 31/2 in width at the widest part; they are not so\r\ndelicately formed, their hair in winter is thicker longer and of a much\r\ndarker grey, in Summer the hair is Still coarser longer and of a paler\r\nred, more like that of the Elk; in winter they also have a Considerable\r\nquantity of very fine wool intermixed with the hair and lying next to\r\nthe Skin as the Antelope has. the long hair which grows on the outer\r\nSide of the first joint of the hind legs, and which in the Common Deer\r\ndo not usially occupy more than 2 inches in them occupy from 6 to 8;\r\ntheir horns also differ, those in the Common deer consist of two main\r\nbeams gradually deminishing as the points proceed from it, with the\r\nmule deer the horns consist of two beams which at the distance of 4 or\r\n6 inches from the head divide themselves into two equal branches which\r\nagain either divide into two other equal branches or terminate in a\r\nSmaller, and two equal ones; haveing either 2, 4 or 6 points on a beam;\r\nthe horn is not so rough about the base as the common deer, and are\r\ninvariably of a much darker Colour. the most Strikeing difference of\r\nall, is the white rump and tail. from the root of the tail as a center\r\nthere is a circular Spot perfectly white of about 31/2 inches radius,\r\nwhich occupy a part of the rump and the extremities of buttocks and\r\njoins the white of the belley underneath; the tail which is usially\r\nfrom 8 to 9 inches long for the first 4 or 5 inches from its upper\r\nextremity is covered with Short white hairs, much Shorter indeed than\r\nthose hairs of the body; from hence for about one inch further, the\r\nhair is Still white but gradually becoms longer; the tail then\r\ntermonates in a tissue of Black hair of about 3 inches long. from this\r\nblack hair of the tail they have obtained among the French engages the\r\nappelation of the black tailed Deer, but this I conceive by no means\r\nCharacteristic of the Animal as much the larger portion of the tail is\r\nwhite. the Ears and the tail of this Animale when Compared with those\r\nof the Common Deer, So well Comported with those of the Mule when\r\ncompared with the Horse, that we have by way of distinction adapted the\r\nappellation of the mule Deer which I think much more appropriate. on\r\nthe inner corner of each eye there is a drane (like the Elk) or large\r\nrecepticle which Seams to Answer as a drane to the eye which givs it\r\nthe appearance of weeping, this in the Common Deer of the Atlantic\r\nStates is scercely proceptable but becoms more Conspicious in the\r\nfallow Deer, and Still more So in the Elk; this recepticle in the Elk\r\nis larger than any of the Pecora order with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nI have Some reasons to believe that the Calumet Eagle is Sometimes\r\nfound on this Side of the Rocky mountains from the information of the\r\nIndians in whose possession I have Seen their plumage. those are the\r\nSame with those of the Missouri, and are the most butifull of all the\r\nfamily of the Eagle of America it's colours are black and white with\r\nwhich it is butifully varigated. the feathers of the tail which is so\r\nhighly prized by the Indians is composed of twelve broad feathers of\r\nequal length those are white except about two inches at the extremity\r\nwhich is of a jut black. their wings have each a large circular white\r\nSpot in the middle when extended. the body is variously marked with\r\nwhite and black. the form is much that of the Common bald Eagle, but\r\nthey are reather Smaller and much more fleet. this Eagle is feared by\r\nall carnivarous birds, and on his approach all leave the carcase\r\ninstantly on which they were feeding. it breads in the inaccessable\r\nparts of the Mountains where it Spends the Summer, and decends to the\r\nplains and low country in the fall and winter when it is usially Sought\r\nand taken by the nativs. two tails of this bird is esteemed by Mandans,\r\nMinnetares, Ricaras, &c. as the full value of a good horse, or Gun and\r\naccoutrements. with the Osage & Kanzas and those nations enhabiting\r\nCountrys where this bird is more rare, the price is even double of that\r\nmentioned. with these feathers the nativs deckerate the Stems of their\r\nSacred pipes or Calumets; whence the name of Calumet Eagle, which has\r\nGenerally obtained among the Engages. The Ricaras have domesticated\r\nthis bird in many instances for the purpose of obtaining its plumage.\r\nthe nativs in every part of the Continent who can precure those\r\nfeathers attach them to their own hair and the mains and tail of their\r\nfavorite horses by way of orniment. they also deckerate their own caps\r\nor bonnets with those feathers. The Leather winged bat is found &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 12, 1806]\r\nWednesday March 12th 1806\r\nWe sent a party again in surch of the perogue but they returned\r\nunsuccessful) as yesterday. Sent one hunter out on this side of the\r\nNetul, he did not return this evening. I beleive the Callamet Eagle is\r\nsometimes found on this side of the rocky mountains from the\r\ninformation of the Indians in whose possession I have seen their\r\nplumage. these are the same with those of the Missouri, and are the\r\nmost beautiful) of all the family of the Eagles of America. it's\r\ncolours are black and white with which it is beautifully variagated.\r\nthe feathers of the tail which are so highly prized by the Indians is\r\ncomposed of twelve broad feathers of equal length. these are white\r\nexcept about 2 inches at the extremity which is of a jut black. there\r\nwings have each a large circular white spot in the middle when\r\nextended. the body is variously marked with white and black. the form\r\nis much that of the common bald Eagle, but they are reather smaller and\r\nmuch more fleet. this eagle is feared by all carnivorous birds, and on\r\nhis approach all leave the carcase instantly on which they were\r\nfeeding. it breads in the inaccessable parts of the mountains where it\r\nspends the summer, and decends to the plains and low country in the\r\nfall and winter when it is usually sought and taken by the natives. two\r\ntails of this bird is esteemed by the Mandans Minetares Ricares, &c as\r\nthe full value of a good horse, or gun and accoutrements. with the\r\nGreat and little Osages and those nations inhabiting countries where\r\nthis bird is more rare the price is even double of that mentioned. with\r\nthese feathers the natives decorate the stems of their sacred pipes or\r\ncallamets; whence the name, of Callamet Eagle, which has generally\r\nobtained among the Engages. the Ricares have domesticated this bird in\r\nmany instancies for the purpose of obtaining it's plumage. the natives\r\nin every part of the con tinent who can procure these feathers attatch\r\nthem to their own hair and the mains and tails of their favorite horses\r\nby way of ornament. they also decorate their war caps or bonnets with\r\nthose feathers.--The leather winged batt common to the United States is\r\nalso found on this side of the Rocky mountains.--Beside the fish of\r\nthis coast and river already mentioned we have met with the following\r\nspeceis viz. the Whale, Porpus, Skaite, flounder, Salmon, red charr,\r\ntwo speceis of Salmon trout, mountain or speckled trout, and a speceis\r\nsimilar to one of those noticed on the Missouri within the mountains,\r\ncalled in the Eastern states, bottle-nose. I have no doubt but there\r\nare many other speceis of fish, which also exist in this quarter at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, which we have not had an oportunity of\r\nseeing. the shell fish are the Clam, perrewinkle, common mussle,\r\ncockle, and a speceis with a circular flat shell. The Whale is\r\nsometimes pursued harpooned and taken by the Indians of this coast; tho\r\nI beleive it is much more frequently killed by runing fowl on the rocks\r\nof the coast in violent storms and thrown on shore by the wind and\r\ntide. in either case the Indians preseve and eat the blubber and oil as\r\nhas been before mentioned. the whalebone they also carefully preserve\r\nfor sale.--Our party are now furnished with 358 pair of Mockersons\r\nexclusive of a good portion of dressed leather.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 12, 1806]\r\nWednesday March 12th 1806\r\nWe Sent a party again in Serch of the Canoe but they returned\r\nunsucksessfull as yesterday Sent one hunter out on this Side of the\r\nNetul he did not return this evening. Our party are now furnished with\r\n358 par of Mockersons exclusive of a good portion of Dressed leather,\r\nthey are also previded with Shirts Overalls Capoes of dressed Elk Skins\r\nfor the homeward journey.\r\n\r\nBesides the fish of this Coast and river already mentioned we have met\r\nwith the following Species. viz. the Whale, Porpus, Skaite, flounder,\r\nSalmon, red-carr, two Specis of Salmon trout, mountain or Speckled\r\ntrout, and a Speceis Similar to one of those noticed on the Missouri\r\nwithin the mountains, called in the Eastern States, bottle nose. I have\r\nno doubt but there are many other Species of fish which also exist in\r\nthis quarter at different Seasons of the year, which we have not had an\r\noppertunity of seeing. the Shell fish are the Clam, perriwinkle, common\r\nMuscle, cockle, and a Species with a circular flat Shell.\r\n\r\nThe Whale is Sometimes pursued harpooned and taken by the Indians of\r\nthis Coast; tho I believe it is much more frequently killed by running\r\non the rocks of the Coast to S. S. W. in violent Storms, and thrown on\r\ndifferent parts of the Coast by the winds and tide-. in either case the\r\nIndians preserve and eat the blubber and Oil as has been before\r\nmentioned. the whale bone they also carefully preserve for Sale.\r\n\r\nThe Reptiles of this Country are the rattle snake, garter Snake a\r\ncommon brown Lizzard. The Season was so far advanced on this side of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains that but fiew rattle Snakes were Seen, I did not\r\nremark one particularly my Self, nor do I know if they are of either of\r\nthe four Species found in different parts of the United States, or of\r\nthat Species before observed only on the upper parts of the Missouri &\r\nits branches.\r\n\r\nThe Garter Snake So Called in the U States is very common in this\r\ncountry, they are found in great numbers on the open and Sometimes\r\nmarshy grounds in this neighbourhood. they differ not at all from those\r\nof the United States. the Black or Dark brown Lizzard we Saw at the\r\nlong narrows or Commencement of the woody country on the Columbia; they\r\nare also the Same with those of the U, States. The Snail is noumerous\r\nin the woodey Country on this Coast, they are in Shape like those of\r\nthe U, States, but are at least five times their bulk. there is a\r\nSpecis of water Lizzard of which I only Saw one just above the grand\r\nrapid of the Columbia. it is about 9 inches long the body is reather\r\nflat and about the Size of a mans finger, covered with a Soft Skin of\r\ndark brown Colour with an uneaven sufice covered with little pimples,\r\nthe neck and head are Short, the latter termonateing in an accute\r\nangular point and flat. the fore feet each have four toes, the hinder\r\nones five unconnected with a web and destitute of tallons. it's tail\r\nwas reather longer than the body, and in form like that of the muskrat,\r\nfirst riseing in an arch higher than the back, and decending lower than\r\nthe body at the extremety, and flated perpindicularly. the belly and\r\nunder part of the neck and head were of a Brick red every other part of\r\nthe colour of the upper part of the body are dark brown. the mouth was\r\nSmooth without teeth.\r\n\r\nThe horns of Some of the Elk have not yet fallen off and those of\r\nothers have Grown to the length of Six inches. the latter are in the\r\nbest order, from which it would Seem that the pore Elk retain their\r\nhorns longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 13, 1806]\r\nThursday March 13th 1806.\r\nThis morning Drewyer Jos Feilds and Frazier returned; they had killed\r\ntwo Elk and two deer. visited by two Cathlahmahs who left us in the\r\nevening. we sent Drewyer down to the Clatsop village to purchase a\r\ncouple of their canoes if possible. Sergt. Pryor and a party made\r\nanother surch for the lost peroge but was unsuccessfull; while engaged\r\nin surching for the perogue Collins one of his party killed two Elk\r\nnear the Netul below us. we sent Sergt. Ordway and a party for the\r\nflesh of one of the Elk beyond the bay with which they returned in the\r\nevening. the other Elk and two deer were at some distance. R. Fields\r\nand Thompson who set out yesterday morning on a hunting excurtion\r\ntowards point Adams have not yet returned. The horns of some of the Elk\r\nhave not yet fallen off, and those of others have shotten out to the\r\nlength of six inches. the latter are in the best order, from which it\r\nwould seem that the poor Elk retain their horns longest.\r\n\r\nThe Porpus is common on this coast and as far up the river as the water\r\nis brackish. the Indians sometimes gig them and always eat the flesh of\r\nthis fish when they can procure it; to me the flavor is disagreeable.\r\nthe Skaite is also common to the salt water, we have seen several of\r\nthem that had perished and were thrown out on the beach by the tide.\r\nThe flounder is also an inhabitant of the salt water, we have seen them\r\nalso on the beach where they had been left by the tide. the Indians eat\r\nthe latter and esteem it very fine. these several speceis are the same\r\nwith those of the Atlantic coast. the common Salmon and red Charr are\r\nthe inhabitants of both the sea and rivers. the former is usually\r\nlargest and weighs from 5 to 15 lbs. it is this speceis that extends\r\nitself into all the rivers and little creeks on this side of the\r\nContinent, and to which the natives are so much indebted for their\r\nsubsistence. the body of this fish is from 21/2 to 3 feet long and\r\nproportionably broad. it is covered with imbricated scales of a\r\nmoderate size and is variegated with irregular black spots on it's\r\nsides and gills. the eye is large and the iris of a silvery colour the\r\npupil black. the rostrum or nose extends beyond the under jaw, and both\r\nthe upper and lower jaws are armed with a single series of long teeth\r\nwhich are subulate and infleted near the extremities of the jaws where\r\nthey are also more closely arranged. they have some sharp teeth of\r\nsmaller size and same shape placed on the tongue which is thick and\r\nfleshey. the fins of the back are two; the first is plaised nearer the\r\nhead than the ventral fins and has ____ rays, the second is placed far\r\nback near the tail is small and has no rays. the flesh of this fish is\r\nwhen in order of a deep flesh coloured red and every shade from that to\r\nan orrange yellow, and when very meager almost white. the roes of this\r\nfish are much esteemed by the natives who dry them in the sun and\r\npreserve them for a great length of time. they are about the size of a\r\nsmall pea nearly transparent and of a redish yellow colour. they\r\nresemble very much at a little distance the common currants of our\r\ngardens but are more yellow. this fish is sometimes red along the sides\r\nand belley near the gills particularly the male. The red Charr are\r\nreather broader in proportion to their length than the common salmon,\r\nthe skales are also imbricated but reather large. the nostrum exceeds\r\nthe lower jaw more and the teeth are neither as large nor so numerous\r\nas those of the salmon. some of them are almost entirely red on the\r\nbelley and sides; others are much more white than the salmon and none\r\nof them are variagated with the dark spots which make the body of the\r\nother. their flesh roes and every other particular with rispect to\r\ntheir form is that of the Salmon. this fish we did not see untill we\r\ndecended below the grat falls of the Columbia; but whether they are\r\nexclusively confined to this portion of the river or not at all\r\nseasons, I am unable to determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 13, 1806]\r\nThursday March 13th 1806.\r\nThis morning Drewyer Jos. Fields and Frazer returned; they had killed\r\ntwo Elk and two deer. Visited by two Cath-lah-mars who left us in the\r\nevening. we Sent Drewyer down to the Clatsop Village to purchase a\r\ncouple of their canoes if possible. Sergt. Pryor and a party made\r\nanother Serch for the lost Canoe but was unsucksessfull; while engaged\r\nin Serching for the Canoe, Collins one of his party killed two Elk near\r\nthe Netul below us. we Sent Sergt. Ordway and a party for the flesh of\r\none of the Elk beyond the Bay with which they returned in the evening;\r\nthe other Elk and 2 Deer were at Some distance--R. Field and Thompson\r\nwho Set out on a hunting excursion yesterday morning towards point\r\nAdams have not yet returned. took equal altitudes to day this being the\r\nonly fair day for Sometime past.\r\n\r\nThe Porpus is common on this coast and as far up the river as the water\r\nis brackish. the Indians Sometimes gig them and always eat the flesh of\r\nthis fish when they Can precure it; to me the flavour is disagreeable.\r\nthe Skaite is also common to the Salt water, I have Seen Several of\r\nthem that had perished and were thrown out on the beach by the tide.\r\nThe flounder is also an enhabitent of the Salt water. we have Seen them\r\nalso on the beach where they had been left by the tide. the nativs eate\r\nthe latter and esteem it very fine. these Several Species are the Same\r\nof those of the atlantic Coasts. The Common Salmon and red charr are\r\nthe inhabitents of both the Sea and river. the former is usially\r\nlargest and weighs from 5 to 15 lbs. it is this Species that extends\r\nitself into all the rivers and little creek on this Side of the\r\nContinent, and to which the nativs are So much indebted for their\r\nSubsistence. the body of this fish is from 21/2 to 3 feet long and\r\nperpotionably broad. it is covered with imbricated scales of a moderate\r\nSize and is varigated with errigular black Spots on its Side and gills.\r\nthe eye is large and the iris of a Silvery colour the pupil black. the\r\nrostrum or nose extend beyond the under jaws, and both the upper and\r\nthe lower jaw are armed with a Single Series of long teeth which are\r\nSubulate and infleted near the extremities of the jaws where they are\r\nmore closely arranged. they have Some Sharp teeth of Smaller Size and\r\nSame Shape on the tongue which is thick and fleshey. the fins of the\r\nback are two; the first is placed nearer the head than the Venteral\r\nfins and has ____ rays, the Second is placed far back near the tail is\r\nsmall and has no rays. The flesh of this fish when in order of a deep\r\nflesh coloured red and every Shade from that to an orrange yellow, and\r\nwhen very meager almost white. the Roe of this fish are much esteemed\r\nby the nativs, who dry them in the Sun and preserve them for a great\r\nlength of time. they are about the Size of a Small pea nearly\r\ntransparrent and of a redish yellow colour. they resemble very much at\r\na little distance the Common Current of our gardens but are more\r\nyellow. this fish is Sometimes red along the Sides and belly near the\r\ngills; particularly the male of this Species.\r\n\r\nThe Red Charr are reather broader in proportion to their length than\r\nthe Common Salmon, the Skales are also embricated but reather large.\r\nthe nostrum exceeds the lower jaw more and the teeth are neither So\r\nnoumerous or large as those of the Salmon. Some of them are almost\r\nentirely red on the belly and Sides; others are much more white than\r\nthe Salmon, and none of them are varigated with the dark Spots which\r\nmark the body of the other. their flesh roe and every other particular\r\nwith respect to their is that of the Salmon. this fish we did not See\r\nuntill we had decended below the Great falls of the Columbia; but\r\nwhether they are exclusively confined to this portion of the river or\r\nnot at all Seasons, I am unable to determine.\r\n\r\nThe Salmon Trout are Seldom more than two feet in length, they are\r\nnarrow in purportion to their length, at least much more So than the\r\nSalmon & red charr. their jaws are nearly of the Same length, and are\r\nfurnished with a Single Series of Subulate Streight teeth, not so long\r\nor so large as those of the Salmon, the mouth is wide, and the tongue\r\nis also furnished with Some teeth. the fins are placed much like those\r\nof the Salmon. at the Great Falls are met with this fish of a Silvery\r\nwhite colour on the belly and Sides, and a blueish light brown on the\r\nback and head. in this neighbourhood we have met with another Species\r\nwhich does not differ from the other in any particular except in point\r\nof Colour. this last is of a dark colour on the back, and its Sides and\r\nbelley are yellow with transverse Stripes of dark brown. Sometimes a\r\nlittle red is intermixed with these Colours on the belly and Sides\r\ntowards the head. the flesh & roe is like those described of the\r\nSalmon. the white Species which we found below the falls were in\r\nexcellent order when the Salmon were entirely out of Season and not fit\r\nfor use. The Species which we found here early in november on our\r\narival in this quarter had declined considerably, reather more so than\r\nthe Red charr with which we found them asociated in the little\r\nriverlets and creeks. I think it may be Safely asserted that the Red\r\nCharr and both Species of the Salmon trout remain in Season longer in\r\nthe fall of the year than the common Salmon; but I have my doubt\r\nwhether of the Species of the Salmon trout ever pass the Great falls of\r\nthe Columbia. The Indians tell us that the Salmon begin to run early in\r\nthe next month; it will be unfortunate for us if they do not, for they\r\nmust form our principal dependance for food in assending the Columbia\r\nabove the Falls and it's S. E. branch Lewis's river to the Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Speckled or Mountain Trout are found in the waters of the Columbia\r\nwithin the Rocky mountains. they are the Same of those found in the\r\nupper part of the Missouri, but are not So abundent in the Columbian\r\nWaters as in that river. The bottle nose is also found on the waters of\r\nthe Columbia within the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 14, 1806]\r\nFriday March 14th 1806.\r\nThis morning we sent a party after the two Elk which Collins killed\r\nlast evening, they returned with them about noon. Collins, Jos. Fends\r\nand Shannon went in quest of the flock of Elk of which Collins had\r\nkilled those two. this evening we heared upwards of twenty shot, and\r\nexpect that they have fallen in with and killed a number of them.\r\nReubin Fields and Thompson returned this evening unsuccessfull having\r\nkilled one brant only. late in the evening Drewyer arrived with a party\r\nof the Clatsops who brought an indifferent canoe some hats and roots\r\nfor sale. the hats and roots we purchased, but could not obtain the\r\ncanoe without giving more than our stock of merchandize would lisence\r\nus. I offered him my laced uniform coat but he would not exchange. The\r\nSalmon Trout are seldom more than two feet in length they are narrow in\r\nproportion to their length, at least much more so than the Salmon or\r\nred charr. the jaws are nearly of the same length, and are furnished\r\nwith a single series of small subulate streight teeth, not so long or\r\nas large as those of the Salmon. the mouth is wide, and the tongue is\r\nalso furnished with some teeth. the fins are placed much like those of\r\nthe salmon. at the great falls we met with this fish of a silvery white\r\ncolour on the belley and sides, and a bluish light brown on the back\r\nand head. in this neighbourhood we have met with another speceis which\r\ndose not differ from the other in any particular except in point of\r\ncolour. this last is of a dark colour on the back, and it's sides and\r\nbelley are yellow with transverse stripes of dark brown. sometimes a\r\nlittle red is intermixed with these colours on the belley and sides\r\ntowards the head. the eye, flesh, and roes are like those discribed of\r\nthe Salmon. the white speceis which we found below the falls was in\r\nexcellent order when the salmon were entirely out of season and not fit\r\nfor uce. the speceis which we found here on our arrival early in\r\nNovember had declined considerably, reather more so inded than the red\r\nCharr with which we found them ascociated in the little rivulets and\r\ncreeks. I think it may be safely asserted that the red Charr and both\r\nspeceis of the salmon trout remain in season longer in the fall of the\r\nyear than the common Salmon; but I have my doubts whether either of\r\nthem ever pass the great falls of the Columbia. The Indians tell us\r\nthat the Salmon begin to run early in the next month; it will be\r\nunfortunate for us if they do not, for they must form our principal\r\ndependence for food in ascending the Columbia, above the falls and it's\r\nS. E. branch to the mountains. The mountain or speckled trout are found\r\nin the waters of the Columbia within the mountains. they are the same\r\nof those found in the upper part of the Missouri, but are not so\r\nabundant in the Columbia as on that river. we never saw this fish below\r\nthe mountains but from the transparency and coldness of the Kooskooske\r\nI should not doubt it's existing in that stream as low as it's junction\r\nwith the S E. branch of the Columbia.--The bottle nose is the same with\r\nthat before mentioned on the Missouri and is found exclusively within\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 14, 1806]\r\nFriday March 14th 1806\r\nThis morning we dispatched a party after two Elk which Collins killed\r\nlast evening, they returned with them about noon. Jos. Field, Collins,\r\nGo. Shannon & Labiesh went in quest of the Gang of Elk out of which\r\nCollins had killed the 2 yesterday. this evening we herd upwards of\r\ntwenty Shot and expect they have fallen in with and killed Several of\r\nthem. Reuben Field and Thompson returned this evening unsuksessfull\r\nhaveing killed only one Brant. late in the evening Geo. Drewyer arrived\r\nwith a party of the Clatsops who brought an indifferent Canoe, three\r\nhats and Some roots for Sale we could not purchase the Canoe without\r\ngiveing more than our Stock of merchandize would lisence us. Capt Lewis\r\noffered his laced uniform Coat for a verry indiferent Canoe, agreeable\r\nto their usial way of tradeing his price was double. we are informed by\r\nthe Clatsops that they have latterly Seen an Indian from the\r\nQuin-na-chart Nation who reside Six days march to the N. W and that\r\nfour vessles were there and the owners Mr. Haley, Moore, Callamon &\r\nSwipeton were tradeing with that noumerous nation, whale bone Oile and\r\nSkins of various discription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 15, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 15th 1806.\r\nThis morning at 11 OCk. the hunters arrived, having killed four Elk\r\nonly. Labuish it seems was the only hunter who fell in with the Elk and\r\nhaving by some accedent lost the fore sight of his gun shot a great\r\nnumber of times but killed only the number mentioned. as the elk were\r\nscattered we sent two parties for them, they returned in the evening\r\nwith four skins and the flesh of three Elk, that of one of them having\r\nbecome putrid from the liver and pluck having been carelessly left in\r\nthe animal all night. we were visited this afternoon by Delashshelwilt\r\na Chinnook Chief his wife and six women of his nation which the old\r\nbaud his wife had brought for market. this was the same party that had\r\ncommunicated the venerial to so many of our party in November last, and\r\nof which they have finally recovered. I therefore gave the men a\r\nparticular charge with rispect to them which they promised me to\r\nobserve. late this evening we were also visited by Catel a Clatsop man\r\nand his family. he brought a canoe and a Sea Otter Skin for sale\r\nneither of which we purchased this evening. The Clatsops who had\r\nbrought a canoe for sale last evening left us early this morning.-\r\nBratton still sick.\r\n\r\nThere is a third speceis of brant in the neighbourhood of this place\r\nwhich is about the size and much the form of the pided brant. they\r\nweigh about 81/2 lbs. the wings are not as long nor so pointed as those\r\nof the common pided brant. the following is a likeness of it's head and\r\nbeak. a little distance around the base of the beak is white and is\r\nsuddonly succeeded by a narrow line of dark brown. the ballance of the\r\nneck, head, back, wings, and tail all except the tips of the feathers\r\nare of the bluish brown of the common wild goose. the breast and belly\r\nare white with an irregular mixture of black feathers which give that\r\npart a pided appearance. from the legs back underneath the tail, and\r\narond the junction of the same with the body above, the feathers are\r\nwhite. the tail is composed of 18 feathers; the longest of which are in\r\nthe center and measure 6 Inches with the barrel of the quill; those\r\nsides of the tail are something shorter and bend with their extremeties\r\ninwards towards the center of the tail. the extremities of these\r\nfeathers are white. the beak is of a light flesh colour. the legs and\r\nfeet which do not differ in structure from those of the goose or brant\r\nof the other speceis, are of an orrange yellow colour. the eye is\r\nsmall; the iris is a dark yellowish brown, and pupil black. the note of\r\nthis brant is much that of the common pided brant from which in fact\r\nthey are not to be distinguished at a distance, but they certainly are\r\na distinct speis of brant. the flesh of this fowl is as good as that of\r\nthe common pided brant. they not remain here during the winter in such\r\nnumbers as the white brant do, tho they have now returned in\r\nconsiderable quantities. first saw them below tide-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 15, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 15th 1806\r\nThis morning at 11 oClock the hunters arived, haveing Killed four Elk\r\nonly. Labiesh it Seams was the only Hunter who fell in with the Elk and\r\nhaveing by some accident lost the foresight of his gun Shot a great\r\nnumber of times and only killed four. as the Elk were scattered we Sent\r\ntwo parties for them, they return in the evening with four Skins, and\r\nthe flesh of three Elk, that of one of them haveing become putred from\r\nthe liver and pluck haveing been carelessly left in the Animal all\r\nnight. We were visited this Afternoon in a Canoe 4 feet 2 I. wide by\r\nDe-lash-hel-wilt a Chinnook Chief his wife and Six women of his Nation,\r\nwhich the Old Boud his wife had brought for Market. this was the Same\r\nparty which had communicated the venereal to Several of our party in\r\nNovember last, and of which.they have finally recovered. I therefore\r\ngave the men a particular Charge with respect to them which they\r\npromised me to observe. late this evening we were also visited by\r\nCa-tel a Clatsop man and his family. he brought a Canoe and a Sea Otter\r\nSkin for Sale neither of which we could purchase of him. the Clatsops\r\nwhich had brought a Canoe for Sale last evening left us this morning.\r\nBratten is still very weak and unwell.\r\n\r\nThere is a third Species of Brant in the neighbourhood of this place\r\nwhich is about the Size and much the form of the bided brant. they\r\nweigh about 81/2 lbs. the wings are not as long nor So pointed as the\r\nCommon pided brant. the following is a likeness of its head and beak. a\r\nlittle distance arround the base of the beak is white and is Suddenly\r\nSucceeded by a narrow line of dark brown. the ballance of the neck,\r\nhead, back, wings and tail all except the tips of the feathers are of\r\nthe blueish brown of the Common wild goose, the breast and belly are\r\nwhite with an irregular mixture of black feathers which give that part\r\na pided appearance. from the legs back underneath the tail, and around\r\nthe junction of the Same with the body above, the feathers are white.\r\nthe tail is composed of 18 feathers; the longest of which are in the\r\ncenter and measure 6 inches with the barrel of the quill; those on the\r\nSide of the tail are Something Shorter and bend with their extremities\r\ninwards towards the center of the tail. the extremities of these\r\nfeathers are white. the beak is of a light flesh colour. the legs and\r\nfeet which do not differ in Structure from those of the Goose or brant\r\nof the other Species, are of an orrange yellow Colour. the eye is\r\nSmall; the iris is of a dark yellowish brown, and puple black. the note\r\nof this brant is much that of the common pided brant from which in fact\r\nthey are not to be distinguished at a distance, but they Certainly are\r\na distinct Species of brant. the flesh of this fowl is as good as that\r\nof the Common pided brant. they do not remain here dureing the winter\r\nin Such numbers as the white brant do, tho they have now returned in\r\nConsiderable quantities. we first met with this brant on tide water.\r\n\r\nThe Clams of this coast are very Small. the Shells consist of two\r\nvalves which open with a hinge, the Shell is Smooth thin and of an oval\r\nform or like that of the Common Muscle and of a Skye blue colour; it is\r\nof every Size under a Inch & 3/4 in length, and hangs in clusters to\r\nthe moss of the rocks, the nativs Sometimes eate them.--The Periwinkle\r\nboth of the river and Ocian are Similar to those found in the Same\r\nSituation on the Atlantic.--there is also an Animal which inhabits a\r\nShell perfectly circular about 3 inches in diameetor, thin and entire\r\non the marjin, convex and Smooth on the upper Side, plain on the under\r\npart and covered with a number of minute Capillary fibers by means of\r\nwhich it attaches itself to the Sides of the rocks. the Shell is thin\r\nand Consists of one valve. a Small circular opperture is formed in the\r\nCenter of the under Shell the Animal is Soft and boneless &c.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 16, 1806]\r\nSunday March 16th 1806.\r\nNot any occurrence worthy of relation took place today.

Old Delashelwilt and his\r\nwomen still remain they have formed a camp near the fort and seem to be\r\ndetermined to lay close sege to us but I beleive notwithstanding every\r\neffort of their wining graces, the men have preserved their constancy\r\nto the vow of celibacy which they made on this occasion to Capt C. and\r\nmyself. we have had our perogues prepared for our departer, and shal\r\nset out as soon as the weather will permit. the weather is so\r\nprecarious that we fear by waiting untill the first of April that we\r\nmight be detained several days longer before we could get from this to\r\nthe Cathlahmahs as it must be calm or we cannot accomplish that part of\r\nour rout. Drewyer returned late this evening from the Cathlahmahs with\r\nour canoe which Sergt. Pryor had left some days since, and also a canoe\r\nwhich he had purchased from those people. for this canoe he gave my\r\nuniform laced coat and nearly half a carrot of tobacco. it seems that\r\nnothing excep this coat would induce them to dispose of a canoe which\r\nin their mode of traffic is an article of the greatest value except a\r\nwife, with whom it is equal, and is generally given in exchange to the\r\nfather for his daughter. I think the U States are indebted to me\r\nanother Uniform coat, for that of which I have disposed on this\r\noccasion was but little woarn.--we yet want another canoe, and as the\r\nClatsops will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we\r\nwill take one from them in lue of the six Elk which they stole from us\r\nin the winter.-\r\n\r\nThe pellucid jellylike substance, called the sea-nettle is found in\r\ngreat abundance along the strad where it has been thrown up by the\r\nwaves and tide.\r\n\r\nThere are two speceis of the Fuci or seawreckwhich we also find thrown\r\nup by the waves. the 1st speceis at one extremity consists of a large\r\nvesicle or hollow vessell which would contain from one to two gallons,\r\nof a conic form, the base of which forms the extreem end and is convex\r\nand globelar bearing on it's center some short broad and irregular\r\nfibers. the substance is about the consistence of the rind of a citron\r\nmellon and 3/4 of an inch thick. the rihind is smooth. from the small\r\nextremity of the cone a long, hollow, celindrick, and regularly\r\ntapering tube extends to 20 or thirty feet and is then terminated with\r\na number of branches which are flat 1/2 an inch in width rough\r\nparticular on the edges where they are furnished with a number of\r\nlittle ovate vesicles or bags of the size of a pigeon's egg. this plant\r\nseems to be calculated to float at each extremity while the little end\r\nof the tube from whence the branches proceed, lies deepest in the water.\r\n\r\nThe other speceis I have never seen but Capt. Clark who saw it on the\r\ncoast towards the Killamucks informed me that it resembled a large\r\npumpkin, it is solid and it's specific gravity reather greater than the\r\nwater, tho it is sometimes thrown out by the waves. it is of a yellowis\r\nbrown colour. the rhind smooth and consistence harder than that of a\r\npumpkin tho easily cut with a knife. there are some dark brown fibers\r\nreather harder than any other part which pass longitudinally through\r\nthe pulp or fleshey substance wich forms the interior of this marine\r\nproduction.The following is a list of the names of the commanders of\r\nvessels who visit the entrance of the Columbia river in the spring and\r\nautumn fror the purpose of trading with the natives or hunting Elk.\r\nthese names are spelt as the Indians pronounce them.\r\n\r\nMr. Haley, their favorite trader visits them in a vessel with three\r\nmasts, and continues some time\r\n\r\nYouens,\r\nvisits in a\r\n3\r\nmasted vessel-\r\nTrader\r\nTallamon\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\nno trader\r\nCallallamet\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\nTrader. has a wooden leg.\r\nSwipton\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\nTrader.\r\nMoore\r\ndo.\r\n4\r\ndo.\r\ndo.\r\nMackey\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\ndo.\r\nWashington\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\ndo.\r\nMesship\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\ndo.\r\nDavidson\r\ndo.\r\n2\r\n\r\nno trader hunts Elk\r\nJackson\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\nmasted vessel\r\nTrader\r\nBolch\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\ndo.\r\nSkelley\r\ndo.\r\n3\r\ndo.\r\ndo. tho he has been gone some years. he has one eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 17, 1806]\r\nMonday March 17th 1806\r\nCatel and his family left us this morning.

These lists of our names we have given to several of the\r\nnatives and also paisted up a copy in our room. the object of these\r\nlists we stated in the preamble of the same as follows (viz) \"The\r\nobject of this list is, that through the medium of some civilized\r\nperson who may see the same, it may be made known to the informed\r\nworld, that the party consisting of the persons whose names are\r\nhereunto annexed, and who were sent out by the government of the U\r\nStates in May 1804 to explore the interior of the Continent of North\r\nAmerica, did penetrate the same by way of the Missouri and Columbia\r\nRivers, to the discharge of the latter into the Pacific Ocean, where\r\nthey arrived on the 14th November 1805, and from whence they departed\r\nthe ____ day of March 1806 on their return to the United States by the\r\nsame rout they had come out.\"--on the back of some of these lists we\r\nadded a sketch of the connection of the upper branches of the Missouri\r\nwith those of the Columbia, particularly of it's main S. E. branch, on\r\nwhich we also delienated the track we had come and that we meant to\r\npursue on our return where the same happened to vary. There seemed so\r\nmany chances against our government ever obtaining a regular report,\r\nthough the medium of the savages and the traders of this coast that we\r\ndeclined making any. our party are also too small to think of leaving\r\nany of them to return to the U States by sea, particularly as we shall\r\nbe necessarily divided into three or four parties on our return in\r\norder to accomplish the objects we have in view; and at any rate we\r\nshall reach the United States in all human probability much earlier\r\nthan a man could who must in the event of his being left here depend\r\nfor his passage to the United States on the traders of the coast who\r\nmay not return immediately to the U States or if they should, might\r\nprobably spend the next summer in trading with the natives before they\r\nwould set out on their return. this evening Drewyer went inquest of his\r\ntraps, and took an Otter.

The Killamucks, Clatsops, Chinnooks, Cathlahmahs and\r\nWac-ki-a-cums resemble each other as well in their persons and dress as\r\nin their habits and manners.--their complexion is not remarkable, being\r\nthe usual copper brown of most of the tribes of North America. they are\r\nlow in statue reather diminutive, and illy shapen; possessing thick\r\nbroad flat feet, thick ankles, crooked legs wide mouths thick lips,\r\nnose moderately large, fleshey, wide at the extremity with large\r\nnostrils, black eyes and black coarse hair. their eyes are sometimes of\r\na dark yellowish brown the puple black. I have observed some high\r\nacqualine noses among them but they are extreemty rare. the nose is\r\ngenerally low between the eyes.--the most remarkable trait in their\r\nphysiognomy is the peculiar flatness and width of forehead which they\r\nartificially obtain by compressing the head between two boards while in\r\na state of infancy and from which it never afterwards perfectly\r\nrecovers. this is a custom among all the nations we have met with West\r\nof the Rocky mountains. I have observed the heads of many infants,\r\nafter this singular bandage had been dismissed, or about the age of 10\r\nor eleven months, that were not more than two inches thick about the\r\nupper edge of the forehead and reather thiner still higher. from the\r\ntop of the head to the extremity of the nose is one streight line. this\r\nis done in order to give a greater width to the forehead, which they\r\nmuch admire. this process seems to be continued longer with their\r\nfemale than their mail children, and neither appear to suffer any pain\r\nfrom the operation. it is from this peculiar form of the head that the\r\nnations East of the Rocky mountains, call all the nations on this side,\r\nexcept the Aliahtans or snake Indians, by the generic name of Flat\r\nheads. I think myself that the prevalence of this custom is a strong\r\nproof that those nations having originally proceeded from the same\r\nstock. The nations of this neighbourhood or those recapitulated above,\r\nwear their hair loosly flowing on the back and sholders; both men and\r\nwomen divide it on the center of the crown in front and throw it back\r\nbehind the ear on each side. they are fond of combs and use them when\r\nthey can obtain them; and even without the aid of the comb keep their\r\nhair in better order than many nations who are in other rispects much\r\nmore civilized than themselves.--the large or apparently swolen legs\r\nparticularly observable in the women are obtained in a great measure by\r\ntying a cord tight around the ankle. their method of squating or\r\nresting themselves on their hams which they seem from habit to prefer\r\nto siting, no doubt contributes much to this deformity of the legs by\r\npreventing free circulation of the blood. the dress of the man consists\r\nof a smal robe, which reaches about as low as the middle of the thye\r\nand is attatched with a string across the breast and is at pleasure\r\nturned from side to side as they may have occasion to disencumber the\r\nright or left arm from the robe entirely, or when they have occasion\r\nfor both hands, the fixture of the robe is in front with it's corners\r\nloosly hanging over their arms. they sometimes wear a hat which has\r\nalready been discribed. this robe is made most commonly of the skins of\r\na small animal which I have supposed was the brown mungo, tho they have\r\nalso a number, of the skins of the tiger cat, some of those of the Elk\r\nwhich are used principally on their war excursions, others of the skins\r\nof the deer panther and bear and a blanket wove with the fingers of the\r\nwool of the native sheep. a mat is sometimes temperarily thrown over\r\nthe sholders to protect them from rain. they have no other article of\r\ncloathing whatever neither winter nor summer. and every part except the\r\nsholders and back is exposed to view. they are very fond of the dress\r\nof the whites, which they wear in a similar manner when they can obtain\r\nthem, except the shoe which I have never seen woarn by any of them.\r\nthey call us pah-shish'e-ooks, or cloth men. The dress of the women\r\nconsists of a robe, tissue, and sometimes when the weather is\r\nuncommonly cold, a vest. their robe is much smaller than that of the\r\nmen, never reaching lower than the waist nor extending in front\r\nsufficiently far to cover the body. it is like that of the men confined\r\nacross the breast with a string and hangs loosly over the sholders and\r\nback. the most esteemed and valuable of these robes are made of strips\r\nof the skins of the Sea Otter net together with the bark of the white\r\ncedar or silk-grass. these strips are first twisted and laid parallel\r\nwith each other a little distance assunder, and then net or wove\r\ntogether in such manner that the fur appears equally on both sides, and\r\nunites between the strands. it make a warm and soft covering. other\r\nrobes are formed in a similar manner of the skin of the Rackoon, beaver\r\n&c. at other times the skin is dressed in the hair and woarn without\r\nany further preperation. in this way one beaver skin, or two of those\r\nof the Raccoon or tiger catt forms the pattern of the robe. the vest is\r\nalways formed in the manner first discribed of their robes and covers\r\nthe body from the armpits to the waist, and is confined behind, and\r\ndestitute of straps over the sholder to keep it up. when this vest is\r\nwoarn the breast of the woman is concealed, but without it which is\r\nalmost always the case, they are exposed, and from the habit of\r\nremaining loose and unsuspended grow to great length particularly in\r\naged women in many of whom I have seen the hubby reach as low as the\r\nwaist. The garment which occupys the waist, and from thence as low as\r\nnearly to the knee before and the ham, behind, cannot properly be\r\ndenominated a petticoat, in the common acceptation of that term; it is\r\na tissue of white cedar bark, bruised or broken into small shreds,\r\nwhich are interwoven in the middle by means of several cords of the\r\nsame materials, which serve as well for a girdle as to hold in place\r\nthe shreds of bark which form the tissue, and which shreds confined in\r\nthe middle hang with their ends pendulous from the waist, the whole\r\nbeing of sufficient thickness when the female stands erect to conceal\r\nthose parts usually covered from formiliar view, but when she stoops or\r\nplaces herself in many other attitudes, this battery of Venus is not\r\naltogether impervious to the inquisitive and penetrating eye of the\r\namorite. This tissue is sometimes formed of little twisted cords of the\r\nsilk grass knoted at their ends and interwoven as discribed of the\r\nbark. this kind is more esteemed and last much longer than those of\r\nbark. they also form them of flags and rushes which are woarn in a\r\nsimilar manner. the women as well as the men sometimes cover themselves\r\nfrom the rain by a mat woarn over the sholders. they also cover their\r\nheads from the rain sometimes with a common water cup or basket made of\r\nthe cedar bark and beargrass. these people seldom mark their skins by\r\npuncturing and introducing a colouring matter. such of them as do mark\r\nthemselves in this manner prefer their legs and arms on which they\r\nimprint parallel lines of dots either longitudinally or circularly. the\r\nwomen more frequently than the men mark themselves in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe favorite ornament of both sexes are the common coarse blue and\r\nwhite beads which the men wear tightly wound arond their wrists and\r\nankles many times untill they obtain the width of three or more inches.\r\nthey also wear them in large rolls loosly arond the neck, or pendulous\r\nfrom the cartelage of the nose or rims of the ears which are purforated\r\nfor the purpose. the women wear them in a similar manner except in the\r\nnose which they never purforate. they are also fond of a species of\r\nwampum which is furnished them by a trader whom they call Swipton. it\r\nseems to be the native form of the shell without any preperation. this\r\nshell is of a conic form somewhat curved, about the size of a raven's\r\nquill at the base, and tapering to a point which is sufficiently large\r\nto permit to hollow through which a small thred passes; it is from one\r\nto 11/2 Inches in length, white, smooth, hard and thin. these are woarn\r\nin the same manner in which the beads are; and furnish the men with\r\ntheir favorite ornament for the nose. one of these shells is passed\r\nhorizontally through the cartilage of the nose and serves frequently as\r\na kind of ring to prevent the string which suspends other ornaments at\r\nthe same part from chafing and freting the flesh. the men sometimes\r\nwear collars of bears claws, and the women and children the tusks of\r\nthe Elk variously arranged on their necks arms &c. both males and\r\nfemales wear braslets on their wrists of copper brass or Iron in\r\nvarious forms. I think the most disgusting sight I have ever beheld is\r\nthese dirty naked wenches. The men of these nations partake of much\r\nmore of the domestic drudgery than I had at first supposed. they\r\ncollect and prepare all the fuel, make the fires, assist in cleansing\r\nand preparing the fish, and always cook for the strangers who visit\r\nthem. they also build their houses, construct their canoes, and make\r\nall their wooden utensils. the peculiar provence of the woman seems to\r\nbe to collect roots and manufacture various articles which are prepared\r\nof rushes, flags, cedar bark, bear grass or waytape. the management of\r\nthe canoe for various purposes seems to be a duty common to both sexes,\r\nas also many other occupations which with most Indian nations devolves\r\nexclusively on the woman. their feasts which they are very fond are\r\nalways prepared and served by the men.\r\n\r\nComowool and the two Cathlahmahs left us this evening. it continued to\r\nrain so constantly today that Sergt. Pryor could not pitch his canoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 19, 1806]\r\nWednesday March 19th 1806 Inds. Descd.\r\nIt continued to rain and hail in Such a manner that nothing Could be\r\ndone to the Canoes. a party were Sent out early after the Elk which was\r\nkilled last evening, with which they returned in the Course of a fiew\r\nhours, we gave Commorwool alias Cania, a Certificate of his good\r\nconduct and the friendly intercourse which he has maintained with us\r\ndureing our residence at this place; we also gave him a list of our\r\nnames &c.--The Kilamox, Clatsops, Chinnooks, Cath lah mahs Wau ki a cum\r\nand Chiltz I-resemble each other as well in their persons and Dress as\r\nin their habits and manners.--their complexion is not remarkable, being\r\nthe usial Copper brown of the tribes of North America. they are low in\r\nStatue reather diminutive, and illy Shaped, possessing thick broad flat\r\nfeet, thick ankles, crooked legs, wide mouths, thick lips, noses Stuk\r\nout and reather wide at the base, with black eyes and black coarse hair.\r\n\r\nI have observed Some high acqualine noses among them but they are\r\nextreemly reare. the most remarkable trate in their physiognamy is the\r\npeculiar flatness and width of the forehead which they Artificially\r\nobtain by compressing the head between two boards while in a State of\r\ninfancy, and from which it never afterwards perfectly recovers. This is\r\na custom among all the nations, we have met with West of the Rocky\r\nMountains. I have observed the head of maney infants, after this\r\nSingular Bandage had been dismissed, or about the age of 11 or 12\r\nmonths, that were not more than two inches thick about the upper part\r\nof the forehead and reather thiner Still higher. from the top of the\r\nhead to the extremity of the nose is one Streight line. this is done in\r\norder to give a greater width to the forehead, which they much admire.\r\nThis process seams to be continued longer with their female than their\r\nmale children, and neither appears to Suffer any pain from the\r\nopperation. it is from this peculiar form of the head that the nations\r\nEast of the Rocky Mountains, call all the nations on this Side, except\r\nAliahtans, So-so-ne, or Snake Indians by the General name of Flat\r\nHeads. I think my Self that the provalence of this custom is a Strong\r\nproof of those nations haveing originally proceeded from the Same\r\nStock. The nations of this neighbourhood or those recpitulated above,\r\nware their hair loosly flowing on their back and Sholders; both men and\r\nwomen divide it on the Center of the Crown in front and throw it back\r\nbehind the ear on each Side. they are fond of Combs and use them when\r\nthey Can obtain them; and even without the aid of Combs keep their in\r\nbetter order, than inaney nations who are in other respects much more\r\nCivilized than themselves.\r\n\r\nThe large or apparently Sweled legs particularly observable in the\r\nwomen, are obtained in a great measure by tying a cord tight around the\r\nleg above the ancle bone. their method of Squating or resting\r\nthemselves on their hams which they Seam from habit to prefer to\r\nSetting, no doubt contributes much to this deformity of the legs by\r\npreventing free circulation of the blood. This is also the Custom of\r\nthe nations above.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the men like those above on the Columbia river Consists of\r\na Small robe, which reaches about as low as the middle of the thye and\r\nis attatched with a String across the breast and is at pleasure turned\r\nfrom Side to Side as they may have an occasion to disincumber the right\r\nor left arm from the robe entirely, or when they have occasion for both\r\nhands, the fixture of the robe is in front with it's corner loosly\r\nhanging over their Arms. they Sometimes wear a hat which have already\r\nbeen discribed (See 29th Jany.) Their Robes are made most commonly of\r\nthe Skins of a Small animal which I have Supposed was the brown mungo,\r\ntho they have also a number of the Skins of the tiger Cat, Some of\r\nthose of the Elk which are used principally on their war excursions,\r\nothers of the Skins of Deer, panthor, Bear, and the Speckle Loon, and\r\nblankets wove with the fingers of the wool of the native Sheep. and\r\nSome of those on the Sea Coast have robes of Beaver and the Sea Otter.\r\na mat is Sometimes temperaly thrown over the Sholders to protect them\r\nfrom rain. they have no other article of Cloathing whatever neither\r\nwinter nor Summer, and every part except the Sholders and back is\r\nexposed to view. they are very fond of the dress of the whites, which\r\nthey ware in a Similar manner when they Can obtain them, except the\r\nShoe or mockerson which I have never Seen worn by any of them. They\r\nCall us pah-shish-e-ooks or Cloath men. The dress of the women consists\r\nof a roab, tissue, and Sometimes when the weather is uncommonly Cold, a\r\nvest. their robe is much Smaller than that of the men, never reaching\r\nlower than the waist nor extending in front Sufficiently far to cover\r\nthe body. it is like that of the men confined across the breast with a\r\nString and hangs loosely over the Sholders and back. the most esteemed\r\n& valuable of those robes are made of Strips of the Skin of the Sea\r\nOtter net together with the bark of the white Cedar or Silk grass.\r\nthese fish are first twisted and laid parallel with each other a little\r\ndistance asunder, and then net or wove together in Such a manner that\r\nthe fur appears equally on both Sides, and united between the Strands.\r\nit makes a worm and Soft covering. other robes are formed in a Similar\r\nmanner of the Skins of the rackoon, beaver &c. at other times the Skins\r\nis dressed in the hair and worn without any further preperation. in\r\nthis way one beaver Skin or two of the rackoon or one of the tiger Cat\r\nforms a vest and Covers the body from the Armpits to the waist, and is\r\nconfined behind, and destitute of Straps over the Sholder to keep it\r\nup. when this vest is worn the breast of the woman in consealed, but\r\nwithout it which is almost always the case, they are exposed, and from\r\nthe habit of remaining loose and unsuspended grow to great length,\r\nparticularly in aged women, on many of whome I have Seen the bubby\r\nreach as low as the waist. The petticoat or tissue which occupies the\r\nwaiste has been already described (See 7th Novr. 1805) formd. of the\r\nBark of white cedar, Silk grass, flags & rushes. The women as well as\r\nthe men Sometimes cover themselves from the rain by a mat worn over the\r\nSholders. They also Cover their heads from the rain Sometimes with a\r\ncommon water cup or basket made of Cedar bark and bear grass.\r\n\r\nThose people Sometimes mark themselves by punctureing and introducing a\r\nColouring matter. Such of them as do mark themselves in this manner\r\nprefur the legs and arms on which they imprint parallel lines of dots\r\neither longitudinally or circularly. the woman more frequently than the\r\nmen mark themselves in this manner. The favorite orniments of both\r\nSexes are the Common coarse blue and white beads as before discribed of\r\nthe Chinnooks. Those beads the men wear tightly wound around their\r\nwrists and Ankles maney times untill they obtain the width of three or\r\nfour inches. they also wear them in large rolls loosly around the neck,\r\nor pendulous from the cartelage of the nose or rims of the ears which\r\nare purfarated in different places round the extremities for the\r\npurpose. the woman wear them in a Similar manner except in the nose\r\nwhich they never purfarate. they are also fond of a Species of wompum,\r\nwhich is furnished by a trader whome they call Swipton. it seams to be\r\nthe nativ form of the Shell without any preperation. this Shell is of a\r\nconic form Somewhat curved about the Size of a ravens quill at the\r\nbase, and tapering to a point which is Sufficiently large to permit a\r\nhollow through which a Small thread passes; it is from 1 to 11/2 inches\r\nin length, white, Smooth, hard and thin these are worn in the Same\r\nmanner in which the beeds are; and furnish the men with their favorite\r\norniment for the nose. one of these Shells is passed horizontally\r\nthrough cartilage of the nose and Serves frequently as a kind of ring\r\nwhich prevents the string which Suspends other orniments at the Same\r\npart from Chafing and freting the flesh. The men Sometimes wear Collars\r\nof Bears Claws, and the women and children the tusks of the Elk\r\nvariously arranged on their necks arms &c. both male and female wear\r\nbracelets on their wrists of Copper, Brass or Iron in various forms.\r\nThe women Sometimes wash their faces & hands but Seldom. I think the\r\nmost disgusting Sight I have ever beheld is those dirty naked wenches.\r\n\r\nThe men of those nations partake of much more of the domestic drudgery\r\nthan I had at first Supposed. they Collect and prepare all the fuel,\r\nmake the fires, cook for the Strangers who visit them, and assist in\r\nCleaning and prepareing the fish. they also build their houses,\r\nconstruct their Canoes, and make all their wooden utensils. the\r\npeculiar province of the woman Seams to be to collect roots and\r\nmanufacture various articles which are prepared of rushes, flags, Cedar\r\nbark, bear grass or way tape, also dress and manufacture the Hats &\r\nrobes for Common use. the management of the Canoe for various purposes\r\nSeams to be a duty common to both Sexes, as are many other occupations\r\nwhich with most Indian nations devolve exclusively on the womin. their\r\nfeasts of which they are very fond are always prepared and Served by\r\nthe men.-.-.\r\n\r\nit Continued to rain So constantly dureing the day that Sergt. Pryor\r\nCould not Pay his Canoes. The Clatsop Chief Commowool and the two\r\nCath-lah-mahs left us this evening and returned to their village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 20, 1806]\r\nThursday March 20th 1806.\r\nIt continued to rain and blow so violently today that nothing could be\r\ndone towards forwarding our departure. we intended to have Dispatched\r\nDrewyer and the two Fieldses to hunt near the bay on this side of the\r\nCathlahmahs untill we jounded them from hence, but the rain rendered\r\nour departure so uncertain that we declined this measure for the\r\npresent. nothing remarkable happened during the day. we have yet\r\nseveral days provision on hand, which we hope will be sufficient to\r\nsubsist us during the time we are compelled by the weather to remain at\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nAltho we have not fared sumptuously this winter and spring at Fort\r\nClatsop, we have lived quite as comfortably as we had any reason to\r\nexpect we should; and have accomplished every object which induced our\r\nremaining at this place except that of meeting with the traders who\r\nvisit the entrance of this river. our salt will be very sufficient to\r\nlast us to the Missouri where we have a stock in store.--it would have\r\nbeen very fortunate for us had some of those traders arrived previous\r\nto our departure from hence, as we should then have had it our power to\r\nobtain an addition to our stock of merchandize which would have made\r\nour homeward bound journey much more comfortable. many of our men are\r\nstill complaining of being unwell; Willard and Bratton remain weak,\r\nprincipally I beleive for the want of proper food. I expect when we get\r\nunder way we shall be much more healthy. it has always had that effect\r\non us heretofore. The guns of Drewyer and Sergt. Pryor were both out of\r\norder. the first was repared with a new lock, the old one having become\r\nunfit for uce; the second had the cock screw broken which was replaced\r\nby a duplicate which had been prepared for the lock at Harpers ferry\r\nwhere she was manufactured. but for the precaution taken in bringing on\r\nthose extra locks, and parts of locks, in addition to the ingenuity of\r\nJohn Shields, most of our guns would at this moment been untirely unfit\r\nfor use; but fortunately for us I have it in my power here to record\r\nthat they are all in good order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 20, 1806]\r\nThursday March 20th 1806\r\nIt continued to rain and blow so violently to day that nothing could be\r\ndone towards fowarding our departure. we intended to have dispatched\r\nDrewyer & the 2 Field'es to hunt above Point William untill we joined\r\nthem from hense but the rain renders our departure So uncertain that we\r\ndecline this measure for the present. nothing remarkable happened\r\ndureing the day. we have yet Several days provisions on hand, which we\r\nhope will be Sufficient to Serve us dureing the time we are compell'd\r\nby the weather to remain at this place.-.\r\n\r\nAltho we have not fared Sumptuously this winter & Spring at Fort\r\nClatsop, we have lived quit as comfortably as we had any reason to\r\nexpect we Should; and have accomplished every object which induced our\r\nremaining at this place except that of meeting with the traders who\r\nvisit the enterance of this river. our Salt will be very sufficient to\r\nlast us to the Missouri where we have a Stock in Store.--it would have\r\nbeen very fortunate for us had Some of those traders arrived previous\r\nto our departure from hence; as we Should then have had it in our power\r\nto obtain an addition to our Stock of merchandize, which would have\r\nmade our homeward bound journey much more comfortable.\r\n\r\nManey of our men are Still Complaining of being unwell; Bratten and\r\nWillard remain weak principally I believe for the want of proper food.\r\nI expect when we get under way that we Shall be much more healthy. it\r\nhas always had that effect on us heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe Guns of Sergt.

The Clatsops inform us that Several of\r\ntheir nation has the Sore throat, one of which has laterly died with\r\nthis disorder. the Hunters Sent out to day all returned except Colter\r\nunsessfull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 23, 1806]\r\nSunday March 23rd 1806.\r\nHalf after 9 A.M. Colter arrived, having killed one Elk but so distant\r\nthat we could not send for the meat and get arround Point William\r\ntoday, we therefore prefered seting out and depending on Drewyer and\r\nthe hunters we have sent forward for meat. the wind is pretty high but\r\nit seems to be the common opinion that we can pass point William. we\r\naccordingly distributed the baggage and directed the canoes to be\r\nlaunched and loaded for our departure.--at 1 P.M. we bid a final adieu\r\nto Fort Clatsop. we had not proceeded more than a mile before we met\r\nDelashelwilt and a party of 20 Chinnooks men and women. this Cheif\r\nleaning that we were in want of a canoe some days past, had brought us\r\none for sale, but being already supplyed we did not purchase it.

I measured the tail of one of these bucks which was upwards\r\nof 17 Inches long; they are very poor, tho they are better than the\r\nblack tailed fallow deer of the coast. these are two very distinct\r\nspeceis of deer. the Indians call this large Island E-lal-lar or deer\r\nisland which is a very appropriate name. the hunters informed us that\r\nthey had seen upwards of a hundred deer this morning on this island.\r\nthe interior part of the island is praries and ponds, with a heavy\r\ngrowth of Cottonwood ash and willow near the river. we have seen more\r\nwaterfowl on this island than we have previously seen since we left\r\nFort Clatsop, consisting of geese, ducks, large swan, and Sandhill\r\ncrams. I saw a few of the Canvisback duck. the duckinmallard are the\r\nmost abundant. one of the hunters killed a duck which appeared to be\r\nthe male, it was a size less than the duckinmallard. the head neck as\r\nlow as the croop, the back tail and covert of the wings were of a fine\r\nblack with a small addmixture of perple about the head and neck, the\r\nbelley & breast were white; some long feathers which lie underneath the\r\nwings and cover the thye were of a pale dove colour with fine black\r\nspecks; the large feathers of the wings are of a dove colour. the legs\r\nare dark, the feet are composed of 4 toes each of which there are three\r\nin front connected by a web, the 4th is short Hat and placed high on\r\nthe heel behind the leg. the tail is composed of 14 short pointed\r\nfeathers. the beak of this duck is remarkably wide, and is 2 inches in\r\nlength, the upper chap exceeds the under one in both length and width,\r\ninsomuch that when the beak is closed the under is entirly concealed by\r\nthe upper chap. the tongue, indenture of the margin of the chaps &c.\r\nare like those of the mallard. the nostrils are large longitudinal and\r\nconnected. a narrow strip of white garnishes the upper part or base of\r\nthe upper chap; this is succeeded by a pale skye blue colour which\r\noccupys about one inch of the chap, is again succeeded by a transverse\r\nstripe of white and the extremity is of a pure black. the eye is\r\nmoderately large the puple black and iris of a fine orrange yellow. the\r\nfeathers on the crown of the head are longer than those on the upper\r\npart of neck and other parts of the head; these feathers give it the\r\nappearance of being crested. at 1/2 after ten A.M. it became fair, and\r\nwe had the canoes which wanted repairing hailed out and with the\r\nassistance of fires which we had kindled for the purpose dryed them\r\nsufficiently to receive the pitch which was immediately put on them; at\r\n3 in the evening we had them compleat and again launched and reloaded.\r\nwe should have set out, but as some of the party whom we had permitted\r\nto hunt since we arrived have not yet returned we determined to remain\r\nthis evening and dry our beding baggage &c. the weather being fair.\r\nSince we landed here we were visited by a large canoe with ten natives\r\nof the quathlahpahtle nation who are numerous and reside about\r\nseventeen miles above us on the lard. side of the Columbia, at the\r\nentrance of a small river. they do not differ much in their dress from\r\nthose lower down and speak nearly the same language, it is in fact the\r\nsame with a small difference of accent. we saw a great number of snakes\r\non this island they were about the size and much the form of the common\r\ngarter snake of the Atlantic coast and like that snake are not\r\npoisonous. they have 160 scuta on the abdomen and 71 on the tail. the\r\nabdomen near the head, and jaws as high as the eyes, are of a bluefish\r\nwhite, which as it receedes from the head becomes of a dark brown. the\r\nfield of the back and sides is black. a narrow stripe of a light yellow\r\nruns along the center of the back, on each side of this stripe there is\r\na range of small transverse oblong spots of a pale brick ret which\r\ngradually deminish as they receede from the head and disappear at the\r\ncommencement of the tail. the puple of the eye is black, with a narrow\r\nring of white bordering it's edge; the ballance of the iris is of a\r\ndark yellowish brown.--the men who had been sent after the deer\r\nreturned and brought in the remnent which the Vultures and Eagles had\r\nleft us; these birds had devoured 4 deer in the course of a few hours.\r\nthe party killed and brought in three other deer a goose some ducks and\r\nan Eagle. Drewyer also killed a tiger cat. Joseph Fields informed me\r\nthat the Vultures had draged a large buck which he had killed about 30\r\nyards, had skined it and broken the back bone. we came five miles only\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 28, 1806]\r\nFriday March 28th 1806\r\nThis morning we Set out verry early and at 9 A.M. arived at an old\r\nIndian Village on the N E side of Deer island where we found our\r\nhunters had halted and left one man with the Canoes at their Camp, they\r\narrived last evening at this place, and Six of them turned out very\r\nearly to hunt, at 10 A.M. they all returned to camp haveing killed\r\nSeven Deer, those were all of the Common fallow Deer with a long tail.\r\nI measured the tail of one of these bucks which was upwards of 17\r\ninches long; they are very poor, tho they are better than the black\r\ntail Species of the Sea coast. those are two very distinct Species of\r\nDeer. the Indians call this large Island E-lal-lar, or Deer Island,\r\nwhich is a very appropriate name. the hunters informed us that they had\r\nSeen upwards of a hundred Deer this morning on this island. the\r\ninterior of this Island is a prarie & ponds, with a heavy growth of\r\nCotton wood, ash & willow near the river. we have Seen more water fowl\r\non this island than we have previously Seen Since we left Fort Clatsop,\r\nConsisting of Geese, Ducks, large Swan & Sand Hill crains. I saw a fiew\r\nof the Canvis back duck as I believe. at 1/2 after 10 A.M. it became\r\nfair and we had the Canoes which wanted repareing hauled out and with\r\nthe assistance of fires which we had kindled for the purpose dryed them\r\nSufficiently to receve the pitch which was imedeately put on them; at 3\r\nin the evening we had them Compleated and lanced and reloaded. we\r\nshould have Set out but some of the party whome we had permitid to hunt\r\nSince we arrived heve not yet returned. we determined to remain here\r\nthis evening and dry our bedding &c. the weather being fair. Since we\r\nlanded here we were visited by a large Canoe with ten nativs of the\r\nQuathlahpohtle nation who are numerous and reside about fourteen Miles\r\nabove us on the N E. Side of the Columbia above the Enterance of a\r\nSmall river which the Indians call Chfih-w&h-na-hi-ooks. we saw a great\r\nnumber of Snakes on this island; they were about the Size and much the\r\nform of the garter snake of the U. S. the back and Sides are black with\r\na narrow Stripe of light yellow along the Center of the back, with\r\nsmall red spots on each Side they have ____ scuta on the abdomin & ____\r\non the tail and are not poisonous. The men who had been Sent after the\r\ndeer returned with four only, the other 4 haveing been eaten entirely\r\nby the Voulturs except the Skin. The men we had been permitted to hunt\r\nthis evening killed 3 deer 4 Eagles & a Duck. the deer are remarkably\r\npore. Some rain in the after part of the day. we only made 5 miles to\r\nday-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 29, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 29th 1806.\r\nWe set out early this morning and proceeded along the side of Deer\r\nIsland; halted at 10 A.M. near its upper point and breakfasted. here we\r\nwere joined by three men of the Clan-nah-min-na-mun nation. the upper\r\npoint of this Island may be esteemed the lower side or commencement of\r\nthe Columbian valley. after breakfast we proceeded on and at the\r\ndistance of 14 miles from our encampment of the last evening we passed\r\na large inlet 300 yds in width. this inlet or arm of the river extends\r\nitself to the South 10 or 12 M. to the hills on that side of the river\r\nand receives the waters of a small creek which heads with killamucks\r\nriver, and that of a bayau which passes out of the Columbia about 20\r\nmiles above, the large Island thus formed we call wappetoe island. on\r\nthis inlet and Island the following nations reside, (viz)\r\nClan-nah-min-namun, Clacks-star, Cath-lah-cum-up, Clah-in-na-ta,\r\nCath-lah-nah-qui-ah, and Cath-lah-cam-mah-tup. the two first reside on\r\nthe inlet and the others on the bayau and island.--observed a speceies\r\nof small wild onion growing among the moss on the rocks, they resemble\r\nthe shives of our gardens and grow remarkably close together forming a\r\nperfect turf; they are quite as agreeably flavoured as the shives. on\r\nthe North side of the columbia a little above the entrance of this\r\ninlet a considerable river discharges itself. this stream the natives\r\ncall the Cah-wah-na-hi-ooks. it is 150 yards wide and at present\r\ndischarges a large body of water, tho from the information of the same\r\npeople it is not navigable but a short distance in consequence of falls\r\nand rappids a tribe called the Hul-lu-ettell reside on this river above\r\nit's entr.--at the distance of three miles above the entrance of the\r\ninlet on the N. side behind the lower point of an island we arrived at\r\nthe village of the Cath-lah-poh-tle with consists of 14 large wooden\r\nhouses. here we arrived at 3 P.M. the language of these people as well\r\nas those on the inlet and wappetoe Island differs in some measure from\r\nthe nations on the lower part of the river. tho many of their words are\r\nthe same, and a great many others with the difference only of accent.\r\nthe form of their houses and dress of the men, manner of living habits\r\ncustoms &c as far as we could discover are the same. their women wear\r\ntheir ornaments robes and hair as those do below tho here their hair is\r\nmore frequently braded in two tresses and hang over each ear in front\r\nof the body. in stead of the tissue of bark woarn by the women below,\r\nthey wear a kind of leather breech clout about the width of a common\r\npocket handkerchief and reather longer. the two corners of this at one\r\nof the narrow ends are confined in front just above the hips; the other\r\nend is then brought between the legs, compressed into a narrow foalding\r\nbundel is drawn tight and the corners a little spread in front and\r\ntucked at the groin over and arround the part first confind about the\r\nwaist. the small robe which dose not reach the waist is their usual and\r\nonly garment commonly woarn be side that just mentioned. when the\r\nweather is a litte warm this robe is thrown aside and the leather truss\r\nor breech-clout constitutes the whole of their apparel. this is a much\r\nmore indecent article than the tissue of bark, and bearly covers the\r\nmons venes, to which it is drawn so close that the whole shape is\r\nplainly perceived. the floors of most of their houses are on a level\r\nwith the surface of the earth tho some of them are sunk two or 3 feet\r\nbeneath. the internal arrangement of their houses is the same with\r\nthose of the nations below. they are also fond of sculpture. various\r\nfigures are carved and painted on the peices which support the center\r\nof the roof, about their doors and beads. they had large quantities of\r\ndryed Anchovies strung on small sticks by the gills and others which\r\nhad been first dryed in this manner, were now arranged in large sheets\r\nwith strings of bark and hung suspended by poles in the roofs of their\r\nhouses; they had also an abundance of sturgeon and wappetoe; the latter\r\nthey take in great quantities from the neighbouring bonds, which are\r\nnumerous and extensive in the river bottoms and islands. the wappetoe\r\nfurnishes the principal article of traffic with these people which they\r\ndispose of to the nations below in exchange for beads cloth and various\r\narticles. the natives of the Sea coast and lower part of the river will\r\ndispose of their most valuable articles to obtain this root. they have\r\na number of large symeters of Iron from 3 to 4 feet long which hang by\r\nthe heads of their beads; the blade of this weapon is thickest in the\r\ncenter tho thin even there. all it's edges are sharp and it's greatest\r\nwidth which is about 9 inches from the point is about 4 inches. the\r\nform is thus. this is a formidable weapon. they have heavy bludgeons of\r\nwood made in the same form nearly which I presume they used for the\r\nsame purpose before they obtained metal. we purchased a considerable\r\nquantity of wappetoe, 12 dogs, and 2 Sea otter skins of these people.\r\nthey were very hospitable and gave us anchovies and wappetoe to eat.\r\nnotwithstanding their hospitality if it deserves that appellation, they\r\nare great begers, for we had scarcely finished our repast on the\r\nwappetoe and Anchovies which they voluntarily set before us before they\r\nbegan to beg. we gave them some small articles as is our custom on\r\nthose occasions with which they seemed perfectly satisfyed. we gave the\r\n1st Cheif a small medal, which he soon transfered to his wife. after\r\nremaining at this place 2 hours we set out & continued our rout between\r\nthis island, which we now call Cath-lah-poh-tle after the nation, and\r\nthe Lard shore. at the distance of 2 miles we encamped in a small\r\nprarie on the main shore, having traveled 19 miles by estimate. the\r\nriver rising fast. great numbers of both the large and small swans,\r\ngees and ducks seen today. the former are very abundant in the ponds\r\nwhere the wappetoe is found, they feed much on this bulb. the female of\r\nthe duck which was described yesterday is of a uniform dark brown with\r\nsome yellowish brown intermixed in small specks on the back neck and\r\nbreast. the garter snakes are innumerable, & are seen entwined arround\r\neach other in large bundles of forty or fifty lying about in different\r\ndirections through the praries. the frogs are croaking in the swams and\r\nmarhes; their notes do not differ from those of the Atlantic States;\r\nthey are not found in the salt marshes near the entrance of the river.\r\nheared a large hooting owl hollowing this evening. saw several of the\r\ncrested fishers and some of the large and small black-birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 29, 1806]\r\nSaturday March 29th 1806\r\nwe Set out very early this morning and proceeded to the head of deer\r\nisland and took brackfast. the morning was very cold wind Sharp and\r\nkeen off the rainge of Mountains to the East Covered with snow. the\r\nriver is now riseing very fast and retards our progress very much as we\r\nare compelled to keep out at Some distance in the Curent to clear the\r\nbushes, and fallin trees and drift logs makeing out from the Shore.\r\ndureing the time we were at Brackfast a Canoe with three Indians of the\r\nClan-nar-min-na-mon Nation came down, one of those men was dressed in a\r\nSalors jacket & hat & the other two had a blanket each, those people\r\ndiffer but little either in their dress manners & Language from the\r\nClatsops & Chinnooks they reside on Wappato Inlet which is on the S W.\r\nside about 12 miles above our encampment of the last night and is about\r\n2 miles from the lower point, four other Tribes also reside on the\r\ninlet and Since which passes on the South W. Side of the Island, the\r\nfirst tribe from the lower point is the Clannarminamon, on the Island,\r\nthe Clackster Nation on the main S. W. Shore. the next Cath-lah-cum-up,\r\nClhh-in-na-ta, Cath-lah-nah-qui-ah and at Some distance further up is a\r\ntribe called Cath-lah-com-mah-up Those tribes all occupie Single\r\nVillages. we proceeded on to the lower point of the Said island\r\naccompanied by the 3 Indians, & were met by 2 canoes of nativs of the\r\nquath-lah-pah-tal who informed us that the chanel to the N E of the\r\nIsland was the proper one. we prosued their advice and Crossed into the\r\nmouth of the Chahwah-na-hi-ooks River which is about 200 yards wide and\r\na great portion of water into the columbia at this time it being high.\r\nThe indians inform us that this river is crouded with rapids after Some\r\ndistance up it. Several tribes of the Hul-lu-et-tell Nation reside on\r\nthis river. at 3 oClock P.M. we arived at the Quath lah pah tie Village\r\nof 14 Houses on main Shore to the N E. Side of a large island. those\r\npeople in their habits manners Customs and language differ but little\r\nfrom those of the Clatsops and others below. here we exchanged our deer\r\nSkins killed yesterday for dogs, and purchased others to the Number of\r\n12 for provisions for the party, as the deer flesh is too poore for the\r\nMen to Subsist on and work as hard as is necessary. I also purchased a\r\nSea Otter robe. we purchased wappatoe and Some pashaquar roots. gave a\r\nMedal of the Small Size to the principal Chief, and at 5 oClock\r\nreembarked and proceeded up on the N E. of an Island to an inlet about\r\n1 mile above the village and encamped on a butifull grassy plat, where\r\nthe nativs make a portage of their Canoes and Wappato roots to and from\r\na large pond at a Short dis-tance. in this pond the nativs inform us\r\nthey Collect great quantities of pappato, which the womin collect by\r\ngetting into the water, Sometimes to their necks holding by a Small\r\ncanoe and with their feet loosen the wappato or bulb of the root from\r\nthe bottom from the Fibers, and it imedeately rises to the top of the\r\nwater, they Collect & throw them into the Canoe, those deep roots are\r\nthe largest and best roots. Great numbers of the whistling Swan, Gees\r\nand Ducks in the Ponds. Soon after we landed 3 of the nativs came up\r\nwith Wappato to Sell a part of which we purchased. they Continued but a\r\nShort time. our men are recoverey fast. Willard quit well & Bratten\r\nmuch Stronger. we made 15 miles to day only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 30, 1806]\r\nSunday March 30th 1806.\r\nWe got under way very early in the morning, and had not reached the\r\nhead of the island before we were met by three men of the\r\nClan-nah-minna-mun nation one of whom we recognized being the same who\r\nhad accompanied us yesterday, and who was very pressing in his\r\nentreaties that we should visit his nation on the inlet S. W. of\r\nWappetoe island. at the distance of about 2 M. or at the head of the\r\nquathlahpahtle island we met a party of the Claxtars and Cathlahcumups\r\nin two canoes; soon after we were met by several canoes of the\r\ndifferent nations who reside on each side of the river near this place.\r\nWappetoe Island is about 20 miles long and from 5 to 10 in width; the\r\nland is high and extreemly fertile and intersected in many parts with\r\nponds which produce great quantities of the sagittaria Sagittifolia,\r\nthe bulb of which the natives call wappetoe. there is a heavy growth of\r\nCottonwood, ash, the large leafed ash and sweet willow on most parts of\r\nthis island. the black alder common on the coast has now disappeared.\r\nwe passed several fishing camps on wappetoe island and at the distance\r\nof 5 miles above quathlahpotle Island on the N. E. side we halted for\r\nbreakfast near the place we had encamped on the evening of the 4th of\r\nNovember last; here we were visited by several canoes which came off\r\nfrom two towns situated a little distance above us on wappetoe Island.\r\nthe 1st of these tribes about 2 miles above us call themselves\r\nClan-nah-quah, the other about a mile above them call themselves\r\nMult-no-mah. from these visiters we purchased a sturgeon and some\r\nwappetoe and pashequa, for which we gave some small fishinghooks. these\r\nlike the natives below are great higglers in dealing. at 10 A.M. we set\r\nout and had not proceeded far before we came to a landing place of the\r\nnatives where there were several large canoes drawn out on shore and\r\nseveral natives seting in a canoe apparently waiting our arrival; they\r\njoined the fleet and continued with us some miles. we halted a few\r\nminutes at this landing and the Indians pointed to a village which was\r\nsituated abut 2 miles from the river behid a pond lying parallel with\r\nit on the N. E. side nearly opposite to the Clan-nah-quah town. here\r\nthey informed us that the Sho-toes resided. here we were joined by\r\nseveral other canoes of natives from the Island. most of these people\r\naccompanyed us untill 4 in the evening when they all returned; their\r\nprincipal object I beive was merely to indulge their curiossity in\r\nlooking at us. they appeared very friendly, tho most had taken the\r\nprecaution to bring with them their warlike implements. we continued\r\nour rout along the N. E. shore of the river to the place we had halted\r\nto dine on the 4th of Novembr opposite to the center of Immage canoe\r\nisland where the Indians stole Capt. Clarks tomahawk. here we encamped\r\na little before sunset in a beautifull prarie above a large pond having\r\ntraveled 23 M. I took a walk of a few miles through the prarie and an\r\nopen grove of oak timber which borders the prarie on the back part. I\r\nsaw 4 deer in the course of my walk and much appearance of both Elk and\r\ndeer. Joseph feields who was also out a little above me saw several Elk\r\nand deer but killed none of them; they are very shye and the annual\r\nfurn which is now dry and abundant in the bottoms makes so much nois in\r\npassing through it that it is extreemly difficult to get within reach\r\nof the game. Fends killed and brought with him a duck. about 10 P.M. an\r\nindian alone in a small canoe arrived at our camp, he had some\r\nconversation with the centinel and soon departed. The natives who\r\ninhabit this valley are larger and reather better made than those of\r\nthe coast. like those people they are fond of cold, hot, & vapor baths\r\nof which they make frequent uce both in sickness and in health and at\r\nall seasons of the year. they have also a very singular custom among\r\nthem of baithing themselves allover with urine every morning. The\r\ntimber and apearance of the country is much as before discribed. the up\r\nlands are covered almost entirely with a heavy growth of fir of several\r\nspeceis like those discribed in the neighbourhood of Fort Clatsop; the\r\nwhite cedar is also found hereof large size; no white pine nor pine of\r\nany other kind. we had a view of mount St. helines and Mount Hood. the\r\n1st is the most noble looking object of it's kind in nature. it's\r\nfigure is a regular cone. both these mountains are perfectly covered\r\nwith snow; at least the parts of them which are visible. the highlands\r\nin this valley are rolling tho by no means too steep for cultivation\r\nthey are generally fertile of a dark rich loam and tolerably free of\r\nstones. this valley is terminated on it's lower side by the mountanous\r\ncountry which borders the coast, and above by the rainge of mountains\r\nwhich pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids of the\r\nColumbia river. it is about 70 miles wide on a direct line and it's\r\nlength I beleive to be very extensive tho how far I cannot determine.\r\nthis valley would be copetent to the mantainance of 40 or 50 thousand\r\nsouls if properly cultivated and is indeed the only desireable\r\nsituation for a settlement which I have seen on the West side of the\r\nRocky mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 30, 1806]\r\nSunday March 30th 1806\r\nwe got under way verry early and had not proceeded to the head of the\r\nisland before we met with the three men of the Clan-nar-min-a-mon's who\r\nmet us yesterday brackfast at the upper point of the Island we met\r\nSeveral of the Clackstar and Cath-lah-cum-up in two canoes. Soon after\r\nwe were overtaken by Several Canoes of different tribes who reside on\r\neach Side of the river the three above Tribes and the Cldh-in-na-ta\r\ncath-lahnah-qui-up & Cath-lah-com-mah-tup reside on each Side of\r\nWappato inlet and back of Wappato Island which Island is formed by a\r\nSmall Chanel which passes from the Lower part of Image Canoe Island\r\ninto an inlet which makes in from the S W. Side, and receves the water\r\nof a Creek which heads with the Kil a mox River. this wappato Island is\r\nabout 18 or 20 Miles long and in places from 6 to 10 miles wide high &\r\nfurtile with ponds on different parts of it in which the nativs geather\r\nWappato. nearly opposit the upper point of the Isld. behing which we\r\nencamped last night, or on the Wappato Isld. is Several Camps of the\r\nnativs catching Sturgion. about 5 miles Still higher up and on the N E.\r\nSide we halted for brackfast at the place which We had encamped the 4th\r\nof November last. here we were visited by several canoes of Indians\r\nfrom two Towns a Short distance above on the Wappato Island. the 1st of\r\nthose Tribes Call themselves Clan-nah-quah and Situated about 2 miles\r\nabove us, the other about a mile above Call themselves Mult-no-mah we\r\npurchased of those visitors a Sturgion and Some Wappato & quarmarsh\r\nroots for which we gave Small fishing hooks. at 10 a.m. we Set out and\r\nhad not proceeded far before we came to a landing place where there was\r\nSeveral large canoes hauled up, and Sitting in a canoe, appearantly\r\nwaiting our arival with a view to join the fleet indian who was then\r\nalong Side of us. this man informed he was a Shoto and that his nation\r\nresided a little distance from the river. we landed and one of the\r\nindians pointed to the Shoto village which is Situated back of Pond\r\nwhich lies parrelal with the river on the N E. Side nearly opposit the\r\nClan-nah quah village. here we were also joined by Several Canoes\r\nloaded with the natives from the Island who Continued to accompany us\r\nuntill about 4 oClock when they all returned and we proceeded on to the\r\nplace the Indians Stole my Tomahawk 4th Novr. last and Encamped in a\r\nSmall Prarie above a large Pond on N. E and opposit the Center of image\r\nCanoe Island. capt Lewis walked out and Saw Several deer. Jo. Field\r\nShot at Elk he killed and brought in a fine duck. Soon after I had got\r\ninto bead an Indian came up alone in a Small Canoe. Those tribes of\r\nIndians who inhabit this vally differ but little in either their dress,\r\nmanners, habuts and language from the Clat Sops Chinnooks, and others\r\non the Sea coast. they differ in a fiew words and a little in the\r\naccent. The men are Stouter and much better formed than those of the\r\nSea Coast. more of their womin ware their hair braded in two tresses\r\nand hang over each ear. in Stead of the tissue of bark worn by the\r\nwomen below, they ware a kind of leather breech clout as before\r\ndescribed as worn by the Womin at the enterance of Lewis's river-the\r\nwidth of a Common pocket Handkerchief or Something Smaller and longer.\r\nthe two Corners of this at one of the narrow ends are confined in front\r\njust above the hips; the other Side is then brought between their legs,\r\nCompressed into a narrow folding bundle is drawn tight, and the Corners\r\na little Spred in front tucked at the ends over and around the part\r\nfirst confined about the Waiste. a Small roab which does not reach the\r\nWaiste is their usial and only garment commonly worn besides this just\r\nmentioned. when the weather is a little worm the roab is thrown aside,\r\nand the latter truss or breach clout constitutes the whole of their\r\napparreal. this is a much more indesant article than the tissue of\r\nbark, and bearly covers the Mons versus, to which it is drawn So close\r\nthat the whole Shape is plainly perseived. The Houses are Similar to\r\nthose already descrbed. they are fond of Sculpture. various figures are\r\ncarved and painted on the pieces which Support the Center of the roof\r\nabout their dotes and beads. They are well Supplied with anchoves\r\nSturgion and Wappato. The latter furnishes the principal article of\r\ntraffic with those Tribes which they despose of to the nativs below in\r\nexchange for beeds, Cloath and Various articles. the nativs of the Sea\r\ncoast and lower part of this river will dispose of their most valueable\r\narticles to obtain this root. I saw in Several houses of the Cath lah\r\npoh tie Village large Symeters of Iron from 3 to 4 feet long which\r\nhangs by the heads of their beads; the blade of this weapon is thickest\r\nin the Center tho thin even there, all it's edges are Sharp and its\r\ngreatest width which is about 9 inches from the point, is about 4\r\ninches. the form is this this is a formable weapon. they have heavy\r\nbludgeons of wood made in the Same form nearly which I prosume they use\r\nfor the Same purpose before they obtained metal. we made 22 Miles only\r\nto day the wind and a Strong current being against us all day, with\r\nrain. discovered a high mountain S E. Covered with Snow which we call\r\nMt. Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, March 31, 1806]\r\nMonday March 31st 1806\r\nWe set out early this morning and proceeded untill 8 A.M. when we\r\nLanded on the N. side opposite one large wooden house of the Shah-ha-la\r\nnation and took breakfast. when we decended the river in November last\r\nthere were 24 other lodges formed of Straw and covered with bark near\r\nthis house; these lodges are now distroyed and the inhabitants as the\r\nindians inform us have returned to the great rapids of this river which\r\nis their permanent residence; the house which remains is inhabited;\r\nsoon after we landed two canoes came over from this house with 4 men\r\nand a woman. they informed us that their relations who were with them\r\nlast fall usuly visit them at that season for the purpose of hunting\r\ndeer and Elk and collecting wappetoe and that they had lately returned\r\nto the rapids I presume to prepare for the fishing season as the Salmon\r\nwill begin to run shortly.--this morning we overtook the man who had\r\nvisited our camp last night he had a fine sturgeon in his canoe which\r\nhe had just taken. the Sagittaria Sagittifolia dose not grow on this\r\nriver above the Columbian valley.--These indians of the rapids\r\nfrequently visit this valley at every season of the year for the\r\npurpose of collecting wappetoe which is abundant and appears never to\r\nbe out of season at any time of the year. at 10 A.M. we resumed our\r\nmarch accompanyed by three men in a canoe; one of these fellows\r\nappeared to be a man of some note among them; he was dressed in a\r\nsalor's jacket which was decorated in his own fassion with five rows of\r\nlarge and small buttons in front and some large buttons on the pocket\r\nflaps. they are remarkably fond of large brass buttons. these people\r\nspeak a different language from those below tho in their dress habits\r\nmanners &c they differ but little from the quathlahpohtles. their women\r\nwear the truss as those do of all the nations residing from the\r\nquathlahpohtles to the entrance of Lewis's river. they differ in the\r\nmanner of intering their dead. they lay them horizontally on boards and\r\ncover them with mats, in a valt formed with boards like the roof of a\r\nhose supported by forks and a single pole laid horizontally on those\r\nforks. many bodies are deposited in the same valt above ground. these\r\nare frequently laid one on the other, to the hight of three or for\r\ncorps. they deposit with them various articles of which they die\r\npossessed, and most esteem while living. their canoes are frequently\r\nbroken up to strengthen the vault.--these people have a few words the\r\nsame with those below but the air of the language is intirely\r\ndifferent, insomuch, that it may be justly deemed a different language.\r\ntheir women wear longer and larger robes generally, than those below;\r\nthese are most commonly made of deer skins dressed with the hair on\r\nthem. we continued our rout along the N. side of the river passed\r\ndiamond Island and whitebrant island to the lower point of a handsom\r\nprarie opposite to the upper entrance of the Quicksand river; here we\r\nencamped having traveled 25 miles today. a little below the upper point\r\nof the White brant Island Seal river discharges itself on the N. side.\r\nit is about 80 yards wide, and at present discharges a large body of\r\nwater. the water is very clear. the banks are low and near the Columbia\r\noverflow and form several large ponds. the natives inform us that it is\r\nof no great extent and heads in the mountains just above us. at the\r\ndistance of one mile from the entrance of this stream it forks, the two\r\nbranches being nearly of the same size. they are both obstructed with\r\nfalls and innumerable rappids, insomuch that it cannot be navigated. as\r\nwe could not learn any name of the natives for this stream we called it\r\nSeal river from the great abundance of those animals which we saw about\r\nit's entrance. we determined to remain at our present encampment a day\r\nor two for the several purposes of examining quicksand river making\r\nsome Celestial observations, and procuring some meat to serve us as far\r\nas the falls or through the Western mountains where we found the game\r\nscarce as we decended.--the three indians who accompanied us last\r\nevening encamped a little distance above us and visited our camp where\r\nthey remained untill 9 P.M. in the entrance of Seal river I saw a\r\nsummer duck or wood duck as they are sometimes called. this is the same\r\nwith those of our country and is the first I have seen since I entered\r\nthe rocky mountains last summer.--our hunters who had halted a little\r\nbelow Seal river in consequence of the waves being too high for their\r\nsmall canoe did not join us untill after dark. Drewyer who was out\r\nbelow Seal river informed us that game was very scarce in that quarter,\r\na circumstance which we did not expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, March 31, 1806]\r\nMonday March 31st 1806\r\nwe Set out this morning and proceeded untill 8 oClock when we landed on\r\nthe N. Side opposit one large House of the Shah-ha-la Nation near this\r\nhouse at the time we passed on the 4th of November last was Situated 25\r\nhouses, 24 of them were built of Straw & Covered with bark as before\r\nmentioned. those of that description are all distroyed, the one built\r\nof wood only remains and is inhabited. we overtook the man whome came\r\nto our Camp last night and Soon after we landed two canoes Came over\r\nfrom the opposit Side with 5 men & a woman those people informed us\r\nthat their relations who was with them last fall reside at the Great\r\nrapids, and were down with them last fall gathering Wappato which did\r\nnot grow above, and also killing deer, that they Secured the bark of\r\nthe houses which they then lived in against their return next fall.\r\nthey also inform us that their relations also visit them frequently in\r\nthe Spring to collect this root which is in great quantities on either\r\nSide of the Columbia. at 10 A. M we proceeded on accompanied by one\r\nCanoe and three men, one of them appeared to be a man of Some note,\r\ndressed in a Salors jacket which had 5 rows of large & Small buttons on\r\nit. Those people Speak a differant language from those below, with Some\r\nfiew Words the Same, the accent entirely different. their dress and\r\nManners appear very Similar. the women ware the truss or breach clout\r\nand Short robes, and men roabs only passed up on the N. Side of White\r\nbrant Island near the upper point of Which a Small river falls in about\r\n80 yards wide and at this time discharges a great quantity of water.\r\nthe nativs inform us that this river is very Short and heads in the\r\nrange of mountains to the N E of its enterance into the Columbia the\r\nnativs haveing no name which we could learn for this little river we\r\nCall it Seal river from the great number of those Animals which\r\nfrequents its mouth. this river forks into two nearly equal branches\r\nabout 1 mile up and each branch is crouded with rapids & falls. we\r\nproceed on about 2 miles above the enterance of this Seacalf river and\r\nimedeately opposit the upper mouth of the quick Sand river we formed a\r\nCamp in a Small Prarie on the North Side of the Columbia where we\r\nintend to delay one or two days to make Some Selestial observations, to\r\nexamine quick sand river, and kill Some meat to last us through the\r\nWestern Mountains which Commences a fiew miles above us and runs in a\r\nN. N. W. & S. S. E. derection. The three Indians encamped near us and\r\nvisited our fire we entered into a kind of a Conversation by signs, of\r\nthe Country and Situation of the rivers. they informed us that Seal\r\nriver headed in the mountains at no great distance. quick Sand river\r\nwas Short only headed in Mt. Hood which is in view and to which he\r\npointed. this is a circumstance we did not expect as we had heretofore\r\ndeemed a considerable river. Mount Hood bears East from this place and\r\nis distant from this place about 40 miles. this information if true\r\nwill render it necessary to examine the river below on the South Side\r\nbehind the image canoe and Wappato islands for some river which must\r\nwater the Country weste of the western mountains to the Waters of\r\nCalifornia. The Columbia is at present on a Stand and we with\r\ndificuelty made 25 miles to day-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 1, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 1st 1806.\r\nThis morning early we dispatched Sergt. Pryar with two men in a small\r\ncanoe up quicksand river with orders to proceed as far as he could and\r\nreturn this evening. we also sent a party of three hunters over the\r\nriver to hunt a large bottom of woodland and prarie above the entrance\r\nof the Quicksand river; the ballance of the hunters we sent out in\r\ndifferent directions on this side of the Columbia and employed those\r\nabout camp in making a rope of Elkskin. the Indians who encamped near\r\nus last evening continued with us untill about midday. they informed us\r\nthat the quicksand river which we have heretofore deemed so\r\nconsiderable, only extendes through the Western mountains as far as the\r\nS. Western side of mount hood where it takes it's source. this mountain\r\nbears E from this place and is distant about 40 miles. this information\r\nwas corroborated by that of sundry other indians who visited us in the\r\ncourse of the day. we were now convinced that there must be some other\r\nconsiderable river which flowed into the columbia on it's south side\r\nbelow us which we have not yet seen, as the extensive valley on that\r\nside of the river lying between the mountainous country of the Coast\r\nand the Western mountains must be watered by some stream which we had\r\nheretofore supposed was the quicksand river. but if it be a fact that\r\nthe quicksand river heads in Mount Hood it must leave the valley within\r\na few miles of it's entrance and runs nearly parallel with the Columbia\r\nriver upwards. we indeavoured to ascertain by what stream the southern\r\nportion of the Columbian valley was watered but could obtain no\r\nsatisfactory information of the natives on this head. they informed us\r\nthat the quicksand river is navigable a short distance only in\r\nconsequence of falls and rapids; and that no nation inhabits it.-\r\nSergt. Pryar returned in the evening and reported that he had ascended\r\nthe river six miles; that above the point at which it divides itself\r\ninto two channels it is about 300 yds wide tho the channel is not more\r\nthan 50 yds and only 6 ft deep. this is a large vollume of water to\r\ncollect in so short a distance; I therefore think it probable that\r\nthere are some large creeks falling into it from the S. W. the bed of\r\nthis stream is formed entirely of quicksand; it's banks are low and at\r\npreasent overflows. the water is turbid and current rapid.the following\r\nare the courses taken by Sergt. Pryor. S. 10° W. 1 M. to a point on the\r\nLard. side passing a large Island on Stard. S. 24° E. 2 m. to the head of\r\nan Island near the Lard. shore. S 33° E. 4 m. to a stard. point passing\r\nseveral islands on the Lard. side and a creek 50 yds. wide on Stard at\r\n11/2 miles. the river from hence appeared to bend to the East. he heard\r\nfalls of water. several different tribes informed us that it heads at\r\nMount Hood. We were visited by several canoes of natives in the course\r\nof the day; most of whom were decending the river with their women and\r\nchildren. they informed us that they resided at the great rapids and\r\nthat their relations at that place were much streightened at that place\r\nfor the want of food; that they had consumed their winter store of\r\ndryed fish and that those of the present season had not yet arrived. I\r\ncould not learn wheather they took the Sturgeon but presume if they do\r\nit is in but small quantities as they complained much of the scarcity\r\nof food among them. they informed us that the nations above them were\r\nin the same situation & that they did not expect the Salmon to arrive\r\nuntill the full of the next moon which happens on the 2d of May. we did\r\nnot doubt the varacity of these people who seemed to be on their way\r\nwith their families and effects in surch of subsistence which they find\r\nit easy to procure in this fertile valley.--This information gave us\r\nmuch uneasiness with rispect to our future means of subsistence. above\r\nfalls or through the plains from thence to the Chopunnish there are no\r\ndeer Antelope nor Elk on which we can depend for subsistence; their\r\nhorses are very poor most probably at this season, and if they have no\r\nfish their dogs must be in the same situation. under these\r\ncircumstances there seems to be but a gloomy prospect for subsistence\r\non any terms; we therefore took it into serious consideration what\r\nmeasures we were to pursue on this occasion; it was at once deemed\r\ninexpedient to wait the arrival of the salmon as that would detain us\r\nso large a portion of the season that it is probable we should not\r\nreach the United States before the ice would close the Missouri; or at\r\nall events would hazard our horses which we lelft in charge of the\r\nChopunnish who informed us that they intended passing the rocky\r\nmountains to the Missouri as early as the season would permit them wich\r\nis as we believe about the begining of May. should these people leave\r\ntheir situation near kooskooske before our arrival we may probably find\r\nmuch difficulty in recovering our horses; without which there will be\r\nbut little possibility of repassing the mountains; we are therefore\r\ndetermined to loose as little time as possible in geting to the\r\nChopunnish Village. at 3 P.M. the hunters who were sent over the river\r\nreturned having killed 4 Elk and two deer; the Elk were in good order\r\nbut the deer extreemly poor. they informed us that game is very plenty\r\nin that quarter. the hunters on this side of the river also returned\r\nbut had killed nothing; they saw a few Elk and deer. there was also\r\nmuch sign of the black bear seen on the other side of the river. we\r\nsent a party to bring in the flesh of the Elk and deer that were\r\nkilled. they did not return this evening. I purchased a canoe from an\r\nIndian today for which I gave him six fathoms of wampum beads; he\r\nseemed satisfyed with his bargain and departed in another canoe but\r\nshortly after returned and canceled the bargain; took his canoe and\r\nreturned the beads. this is frequently the case in their method of\r\ntraiding and is deemed fair by them. The last evening and this morning\r\nwere so cloudy that I could neither obtain any Lunar observations nor\r\nequal altitudes.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 1, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 1st 1806\r\nThis morning early we dispatched Sergt. Pryor, with two men in a Small\r\ncanoe up quick sand river with orders to proceed as far as he Could and\r\nreturn this evening. we also Sent a party of three hunters over the\r\nriver to hunt a large bottom of woodland and prarie above the enterance\r\nof Q. Sand River; the ballance of the hunters we Sent out in different\r\ndirections on this Side of the Columbia, and employed those about Camp\r\nin makeing a rope of Elk Skin.\r\n\r\nThe information given by the indians to us last night respecting quick\r\nSand river was corrobarated by Sundery other indians who visited us in\r\nthe Course of this day. we were now convinced that if there information\r\nbe just; that Some Considerable river which flowed into the Columbia on\r\nit's South Side below us which we have not yet Seen, as the extensive\r\nvally on that Side of the river lying between the mountanious Country\r\nof the Coast, and the western mountains must be watered by Some Stream,\r\nwhich we had heretofore Supposed was the quick Sand river. but if it be\r\na fact that Quick Sand river heads in Mount Hood it must leave the\r\nvally within a fiew miles of it's enterance, and runs nearly parrilal\r\nwith the Columbia River upwards. we indeavered to assertained by what\r\nStream the South portion of the Columbian Vally was watered, but could\r\nobtain no Satisfactory information of the waters on this head. they\r\ninform us that the quick Sand river is not naviagable any distance in\r\nconsequence of falls and rapids; and that no nation inhabit it. Sergt.\r\nPryor returned in the evening and reported that he had assended the\r\nriver Six Miles; that above the point which it divides itself into two\r\nChanels, it is about 300 yards wide tho the Chanel is not more than 50\r\nyards, and only 6 feet deep. the other part of the river from 2 to 4\r\ninches water, the bead of this river is formed entirely of quick Sand;\r\nits banks are low and at present overflown. the water is turbed and\r\ncurrent rapid.--The following are the Courses taken by Sergt. Pryor.-\r\n\"S. 10° W. 1 mile to a point on the Lard. Side passing a large island on\r\nStard Side. S 24° E. 2 m. to the head of the island near the Lard Shore.\r\nS 33° E 4 m. to a Stard. point passing Several islands on the Lard Side\r\nand a Creek 50 yards wide on the Stard. Side at 11/2 miles. the river\r\nfrom hence upwards bend to the East. a fall of water heard at no great\r\ndistance up this river.\" Several diffirent tribes of indians inform us\r\nthat it heads at Mount Hood which is in view.\r\n\r\nWe were visited by Several Canoes of the nativs in the Course of this\r\nday; most of whome were decending the river with their womin and\r\nchildren. they inform us that they reside at the great rapids and that\r\ntheir relations at that place were much Streightened for the want of\r\nfood; that they had consumed their winter Store of dryed fish and those\r\nof the present Season had not yet arived. I could not lern whether they\r\ntook Sturgion but prosume if they do it is in but Small quantities as\r\nthey complain much of the Scercity of food among them, they informed us\r\nthat the nativs above them were in the Same Situation, and that they\r\ndid not expect the Salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon\r\nwhich happens on the 2nd of May. we did not doubt the veracity of those\r\npeople who Seamed to be on their way with their families and effects in\r\nserch of Subsistence which they find it easy to precure in this fertile\r\nVally-. This information givs us much uneasiness with respect to our\r\nfuture means of Subsistence, above the falls, on through the Plains\r\nfrom thence to the Chopunnish there are no Deer Antilopes or Elk on\r\nwhich we could depend for Subsistence; their horses are very poor most\r\nprobably at this Season, and if they have no fish their dogs must be in\r\nthe Same Situation. under these circumstances there Seams to be a\r\ngloomey prospect for Subsistence on any terms; we therefore took it\r\ninto Serious Consideration what measure we were to pursue on this\r\nOccasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to waite the arival of the\r\nSalmon as that would detain us So long a portion of the Season that it\r\nis probable we Should not reach the U States before the ice would close\r\nthe Missouri; or at all events would hazard our horses which we left in\r\ncharge of the Chopunnish who informed us that they intended passing the\r\nRocky Mountains to the Missouri as early as the Season would permit\r\nthem which is about the first of May. Should these people leave their\r\nSituation near Kooskooske before our arival we may probably find much\r\ndificulty in recovering our horses; without which there will be but\r\nlittle possibility of repassing the Mountains; we are therefore\r\ndetermined to lose as little time as possible in getting to the Cho\r\npunnish Village.\r\n\r\nat 3 P.M. the hunters who were Sent over the river returned, haveing\r\nKilled 4 Elk and 2 Deer; the Elk were in good order but the deer\r\nextreemly poor. they informed us that game is very plenty in that\r\nquarter. the hunters on this Side of the river also returned but had\r\nkilled nothing; they Saw a fiew Elk and Deer. there were also much Sign\r\nof the black bear Seen on the other Side of the river. we Sent a party\r\nto bring in the flesh of the Elk and Deer that were killed. they did\r\nnot return this evening. We purchased a Canoe from an Indian today for\r\nSix fathoms of white wampom; he Seemed Satisfied with his bargin and\r\ndeparted in another Canoe but Shortly after returned and canseled the\r\nbargain, took his canoe and returned the beeds. this is frequently the\r\ncase in their method of tradeing and is deemed fair by them. The last\r\nevening and this morning were So cloudy that we could neither obtain\r\nany Lunar observations nor equal altitudes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 2, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 2ed 1806.\r\nThis morning we came to a resolution to remain at our present\r\nencampment or some where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained\r\nas much dryed meat as would be necessary for our voyage as far as the\r\nChopunnish. to exchange our perogues for canoes with the natives on our\r\nway to the great falls of the columbia or purchase such canoes from\r\nthem for Elkskins and Merchandize as would answer our purposes. these\r\ncanoes we intend exchanging with the natives of the plains for horses\r\nas we proceed untill we obtain as many as will enable us to travel\r\naltogether by land. at some convenient point, perhaps at the entrence\r\nof the S. E. branch of the Columbia, we purpose sending a party of four\r\nor five men a head to collect our horses that they may be in readiness\r\nfor us by our arrival at the Chopunnish; calculating by thus acquiring\r\na large stock of horses we shall not only sucure the means of\r\ntransporting our baggage over the mountains but that we will also have\r\nprovided the means of subsisting; for we now view the horses as our\r\nonly certain resource for food, nor do we look forward to it with any\r\ndetestation or borrow, so soon is the mind which is occupyed with any\r\ninteresting object reconciled to it's situation. The men who were sent\r\nin quest of the Elk and deer that were killed yesterday returned at 8\r\nA.M. this morning. we now enformed the party of our intention of laying\r\nin a store of meat at this place, and immediately dispatched two\r\nparteis consisting of nine men to the opposite side of the river. five\r\nof those we sent below the Quicksand river and 4 above. we also sent\r\nout three others on this side, and those who remained in camp were\r\nemployed in collecting wood making a scaffoald and cuting up the meat\r\nin order to dry it. about this time several canoes of the natives\r\narrived at our camp and among others one from below which had on board\r\neight men of the Shah-ha-la nation these men informed us that 2 young\r\nmen whom they pointed out were Cash-hooks and resided at the falls of a\r\nlarge river which discharges itself into the Columbia on it's South\r\nside some miles below us. we readily prevailed on them to give us a\r\nsketch of this river which they drew on a mat with a coal. it appeared\r\nthat this river which they called Mult-no-mah discharged itself behind\r\nthe Island which we called the image canoe Island and as we had left\r\nthis island to the S. both in ascending and decending the river we had\r\nnever seen it. they informed us that it was a large river and run a\r\nconsiderable distance to the South between the mountains. Capt. Clark\r\ndetermined to return and examine this river accordingly he took a party\r\nof seven men and one of the perogues and set out 1/2 after 11 A.M., he\r\nhired one of the Cashhooks, for a birning glass, to pilot him to the\r\nentrance of the Multnomah river and took him on board with him. in\r\ntheir manners dress language and stature these people are the same with\r\nthe quathlahpohtle nation and others residing in the neighbourhood of\r\nwappetoe Island. near the entrance of multnomah river a considerable\r\nnation resides on the lower side of that stream by the same name. as\r\nmany as ten canoes with natives arrived at our camp in the course of\r\nthe day; most of them were families of men women and children decencing\r\nthe river. they all gave the same account of the scarcity of provision\r\nabove. I shot my air gun, with which they were much astonished. one\r\nfamily consisting of ten or twelve persons remained near us all night.\r\nthey conducted themselves in a very orderly manner. the three hunters\r\non this side of the river returned in the evening they had killed two\r\ndeer, tho they were so poor and at such a distance from camp that they\r\nbrought in their skins only. the night and morning being cloudy I was\r\nagain disappointed in making the observations I wished.\r\n\r\nFir is the common growth of the uplands, as is the cottonwood, ash;\r\nlarge leafed ash and sweet willow that of the bottom lands. the\r\nhuckleburry, shallon, and the several evergreen shrubs of that speceis\r\nwhich bear burries have seased to appear except that speceis which has\r\nthe leaf with a prickly margin. among the plants of this prarie in\r\nwhich we are encamped I observe the passhequo, Shannetahque, and\r\ncompound firn the roots of which the natives eat; also the water cress,\r\nstrawburry, flowering pea not yet in blume, the sinquefoil, narrow\r\ndock, sand rush which are luxuriant and abundant in the river bottoms;\r\na speceis of the bearsclaw of which I preserved a specemine it is in\r\nblume. the large leafed thorn has also disappeared. the red flowering\r\ncurrant is found here in considerable quantities on the uplands. the\r\nhunters inform me that there are extensive praries on the highlands a\r\nfew miles back from the river on this side. the land is very fertile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 2, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 2nd 1806\r\nThis morning we came to a resolution to remain at our present\r\nencampment or Some where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained\r\nas much dried meat as would be necessary for our voyage as far as the\r\nChopunnish. to exchange our large Canoes for Small ones with the nativs\r\non our way to the great Falls of the Columbia or purchase Such canoes\r\nfrom them for Elk skins and Merchindize as would answer our purposes.\r\nthese canoes we intend exchangeing with the nativs of the Plains for\r\nhorses as we proceed untill we obtain as maney as will enable us to\r\ntravel altogether by land. at Some convenient point, perhaps at the\r\nenterance of Lewis's River we intend Sending a party of 4 or 5 men\r\nahead to Collect our horses that they may be in readiness for us by our\r\narrival at the Chopunnish; Calculating by thus acquireing a large Stock\r\nof horses we shall not only Secure the means of transporting our\r\nbaggage over the Mountains, but that we also have provided the means of\r\nSubsisting; for we now view the horses as our only Certain resource for\r\nfood, nor do we look foward to it with any detestation or horrow, So\r\nSoon is the Mind which is occupied with any interesting object,\r\nreconsiled to it's Situation. The men who went in quest of the Elk and\r\nDeer which were killed yesterday returned at 8 A.M. this morning. we\r\nnow informed the party of our intention of laying in a Store of meat at\r\nthis place, and imediately dispatched two parties Consisting of nine\r\nmen to the opposit Side of the river. 5 of them below and 4 above quick\r\nSand River. we also Sent out 3 others on this Side, and those who\r\nremained in Camp were employd in Collecting wood makeing a Scaffold and\r\nCutting up the meat in order to dry it. about this time Several Canoes\r\nof the nativs arived at our Camp among others two from below with Eight\r\nmen of the Shah-ha-la Nation those men informed us that they reside on\r\nthe opposit Side of the Columbia near Some pine trees which they\r\npointed to in the bottom South of the Dimond Island, they Singled out\r\ntwo young men whome they informed us lived at the Falls of a large\r\nriver which discharges itself into the Columbia on it's South Side Some\r\nMiles below us. we readily provailed on them to give us a Sketch of\r\nthis river which they drew on a Mat with a coal, it appeared that this\r\nriver which they Call Mult-no'-mah discharged itself behind the Island\r\nwe call the image Canoe island, and as we had left this Island to the\r\nSouth both in decending & assending the river we had never Seen it.\r\nthey informed us that it was a large river and runs a Considerable\r\ndistance to the South between the Mountains. I deturmined to take a\r\nSmall party and return to this river and examine its Size and Collect\r\nas much information of the nativs on it or near its enterance into the\r\nColumbia of its extent, the Country which it waters and the nativs who\r\ninhabit its banks &c. I took with me Six Men. Thompson J. Potts, Peter\r\nCrusat, P. Wiser, T. P. Howard, Jos. Whitehouse & my man York in a\r\nlarge Canoe, with an Indian whome I hired for a Sun glass to accompany\r\nme as a pilot. at half past 11 A.M. I Set out, and had not proceeded\r\nfar eer I saw 4 large Canoes at Some distance above decending and\r\nbending their Course towards our Camp which at this time is very weak\r\nCapt. Lewis haveing only 10 men with him. I hisitated for a moment\r\nwhether it would not be advisable for me to return and delay untill a\r\npart of our hunters Should return to add more Strength to our Camp. but\r\non a Second reflection and reverting to the precautions always taken by\r\nmy friend Capt Lewis on those occasions banished all apprehensions and\r\nI proceeded on down. at 8 miles passed a village on the South side at\r\nthis place my Pilot informed me he resided and that the name of his\r\ntribe is Ne-cha-co-lee, this village is back or to the South of Dimond\r\nisland, and as we passed on the North Side of the island both decending\r\n& assending did not See or know of this Village. I proceeded on without\r\nlanding at this village. at 3 P.M. I landed at a large double house of\r\nthe Ne-er-choki-oo tribe of the Shah-ha-la Nation. at this place we had\r\nSeen 24 aditional Straw Huts as we passed down last fall and whome as I\r\nhave before mentioned reside at the Great rapids of the Columbia. on\r\nthe bank at different places I observed Small Canoes which the women\r\nmake use of to gather Wappato & roots in the Slashes. those Canoes are\r\nfrom 10 to 14 feet long and from 18 to 23 inches wide in the widest\r\npart tapering from the center to both ends in this form and about 9\r\ninches deep and So light that a woman may with one hand haul them with\r\nease, and they are Sufficient to Carry a woman an Some loading. I think\r\n100 of those canoes were piled up and Scattered in different directions\r\nabout in the Woods in the vecinity of this house, the pilot informed me\r\nthat those Canoes were the property of the inhabitents of the Grand\r\nrapids who used them ocasionally to gather roots. I entered one of the\r\nrooms of this house and offered Several articles to the nativs in\r\nexchange for Wappato. they were Sulkey and they positively refused to\r\nSell any. I had a Small pece of port fire match in my pocket, off of\r\nwhich I cut a pece one inch in length & put it into the fire and took\r\nout my pocket Compas and Set myself doun on a mat on one Side of the\r\nfire, and a magnet which was in the top of my ink Stand the port fire\r\ncought and burned vehemently, which changed the Colour of the fire;\r\nwith the Magnit I turned the Needle of the Compas about very briskly;\r\nwhich astonished and alarmed these nativs and they laid Several parsles\r\nof Wappato at my feet, & begged of me to take out the bad fire; to this\r\nI consented; at this moment the match being exhausted was of course\r\nextinguished and I put up the magnet &c. this measure alarmed them So\r\nmuch that the womin and children took Shelter in their beads and behind\r\nthe men, all this time a very old blind man was Speaking with great\r\nvehemunce, appearently imploreing his gode. I lit my pipe and gave them\r\nSmoke & gave the womin the full amount of the roots which they had put\r\nat my feet. they appeared Somewhat passified and I left them and\r\nproceeded on on the South Side of Image Canoe Island which I found to\r\nbe two Islands hid from the opposit Side by one near the Center of the\r\nriver. the lower point of the upper and the upper point of the lower\r\ncannot be Seen from the North Side of the Columbia on which we had\r\npassed both decending and ascending and had not observed the apperture\r\nbetween those islands. at the distance of 13 Miles below the last\r\nvillage and at the place I had Supposed was the lower point of the\r\nimage Canoe island, I entered this river which the nativs had informed\r\nus of, Called Mult no mah River so called by the nativs from a Nation\r\nwho reside on Wappato Island a little below the enterance of this\r\nriver. Multnomah discharges itself in the Columbia on the S. E. and may\r\nbe justly Said to be 1/4 the Size of that noble river. Multnomah had\r\nfallen 18 inches from it's greatest annual height. three Small Islands\r\nare situated in it's mouth which hides the river from view from the\r\nColumbia from the enterance of this river, I can plainly See Mt.\r\nJefferson which is high and Covered with snow S. E. Mt. Hood East, Mt\r\nSt. Helians a high humped Mountain to the East of Mt St. Helians. I\r\nalso Saw the Mt. Raneer Nearly North. Soon after I arived at this river\r\nan old man passed down of the Clark a'mos Nation who are noumerous and\r\nreside on a branch of this river which receives it's waters from\r\nMt.,Jefferson which is emensely high and discharges itself into this\r\nriver one day and a half up, this distance I State at 40 Miles. This\r\nnation inhabits 11 Villages their Dress and language is very Similar to\r\nthe Quath-lah-poh-tle and other tribes on Wappato Island.\r\n\r\nThe Current of the Multnomar is as jentle as that of the Columbia\r\nglides Smoothly with an eavin surface, and appears to be Sufficiently\r\ndeep for the largest Ship. I attempted fathom it with a Cord of 5\r\nfathom which was the only Cord I had, could not find bottom 1/3 of the\r\ndistance across. I proceeded up this river 10 miles from it's enterance\r\ninto the Columbia to a large house on the N E. Side and Encamped near\r\nthe house, the flees being So noumerous in the house that we could not\r\nSleep in it. this is the house of the Cush-hooks Nation who reside at\r\nthe falls of this river which the pilot informs me they make use of\r\nwhen they Come down to the Vally to gather Wappato. he also informs me\r\nthat a number of other Smaller houses are Situated on two Bayous which\r\nmake out on the S. E. Side a little below the house. this house appears\r\nto have been laterly abandoned by its inhabitants in which they had\r\nleft Sundery articles Such as Small Canoes mats, bladdles of Oil and\r\nbaskits bowls & trenchers. and as my pilot informed me was gorn up this\r\nto the falls to fish which is 2 days or 60 miles up. this house is 30\r\nfeet wide & presisely 40 feet long. built in the usial form of broad\r\nboads Covered with bark.\r\n\r\nThe course and distance assending the Molt no mar R from it's enterance\r\ninto the Columbia at the lower point of the 3rd Image Canoe island. viz.\r\n\r\nS. 30°W. 2 Miles to the upper point of a Small island in the Middle of\r\nMoltnomar river. thence\r\n\r\nS. 10° W. 3 miles to a Sluce 80 yards wide which devides Wappato Island\r\nfrom the Main Stard. Side Shore passing a Willow point on the Lard.\r\nSide.\r\n\r\nS. 60° E. 3 miles to a large Indian house on the Lard Side below Some\r\nhigh pine land. high bold Shore on the Starboard Side. thence\r\n\r\nS. 30° E 2 miles to a bend under the high lands on the Stard Side\r\n\r\nmiles 10 passing a Larborad point.\r\n\r\nthence the river bends to the East of S East as far as I could See. at\r\nthis place I think the wedth of the river may be Stated at 500 yards\r\nand Sufficiently deep for a Man of War or Ship of any burthen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 3, 1806]\r\nThursday April 3rd 1806.\r\nEarly this morning Joseph Feilds came over and informed me that Reubin\r\nFeilds Drewyer and himself had killed four Elk. as the party with me\r\nwere now but weak and the Indians constantly crouding about our camp, I\r\nthought it best to send a few men to dry the meat on the other side of\r\nthe river; accordingly Sergt Pryor and two men returned with Jos.\r\nFields for that purpose. the hunters were ordered to continue the\r\nchase; while the others were employed in drying the meat. I have had no\r\naccount as yet from the party below the entrance of Quicksand river.\r\nThe Indians continued to visit us today in considerable numbers most of\r\nthem were decending the river with their families. these poor people\r\nappeared to be almost starved, they picked up the bones and little\r\npeices of refuse meat which had been thrown away by the party. they\r\nconfirm the report of the scarcity of provision among the natives\r\nabove. I observe some of the men among them who wear a girdle arround\r\nthe waist between which and the body in front they confine a small skin\r\nof the mink or polecat which in some measure conceals the parts of\r\ngeneration, they also frequently wear a cap formed of the skin of the\r\ndeer's head with the ears left on it, they have some collars of leather\r\nwrought with porcupine quills after the method of the Shoshonees. From\r\nthis place Mount Hood bears S. 85 E. distant 40 miles. This evening we\r\ncompleted drying the flesh of the Elk which had been brought to camp.\r\nat 6 P.M. Capt. Clark returned, having completely succeeded in his\r\nexpedition. he found the entrance of the large river of which the\r\nIndians had informed us, just at the upper part of wappetoe Island. the\r\nfollowing is a sketch of the rivers furnished Capt C. by an old and\r\ninteligent Indian man.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 3, 1806]\r\nThursday April 3rd 1806\r\nThe water had fallen in the course of last night five inches. I Set out\r\nand proceeded up a Short distance and attempted a Second time to fathom\r\nthe river with my cord of 5 fathom but could find no bottom. the mist\r\nwas So thick that I could See but a Short distance up this river. where\r\nI left it, it was binding to the East of S. E. being perfectly\r\nSati'fyed of the Size and magnitude of this great river which must\r\nWater that vast tract of Country betwen the Western range of mountains\r\nand those on the Sea coast and as far S. as the Waters of Callifornia\r\nabout Latd. 37° North I deturmined to return. at 7 oClock A.M. Set out on\r\nmy return. the men exirted themselves and we arived at the Ne er cho ki\r\noo house in which the nativs were So illy disposed yesterday at 11 A.M.\r\nI entered the house with a view to Smoke with those people who\r\nConsisted of about 8 families, finding my presence alarmed them So much\r\nthat the children hid themselves, womin got behind their men, and the\r\nmen hung their heads, I detained but a fiew minits and returnd on board\r\nthe canoe. My pilot who Continued in the Canoe informed me on my return\r\nthat those people as well as their relations were very illy disposed\r\nand bad people. I proceeded on along the South Side met five canoes of\r\nthe Shah-ha-la Nation from the Great rapids with their wives and\r\nChildren decending the Columbia into this fertile Vally in pursute of\r\nprovi-sions. my Pilot informed me in a low voice that those people were\r\nnot good, and I did not Suffer them to come along Side of my Canoe\r\nwhich they appeared anxious to do. their numbers in those canoes who\r\nappeard anxious to come along Side was 21 men and 3 boys. at 3 P M. we\r\narived at the residence of our Pilot which consists of one long house\r\nwith Seven appartments or rooms in Square form about 30 feet each room\r\nopening into a passage which is quit through the house those passages\r\nare about 4 feet in width and formed of Wide boads Set on end in the\r\nground and reaching to the Ruff which Serves also as divisions to the\r\nrooms. The ground plot is in this form 1 1 1 1 is the passages. 2 2 &c.\r\nis the apartments about 30 feet square. this house is built of bark of\r\nthe White Cedar Supported on long Stiff poles resting on the ends of\r\nbroad boads which form the rooms &c. back of this house I observe the\r\nwreck of 5 houses remaining of a very large Village, the houses of\r\nwhich had been built in the form of those we first Saw at the long\r\nnarrows of the E-lute Nation with whome those people are connected. I\r\nindeavored to obtain from those people of the Situation of their\r\nnation, if scattered or what had become of the nativs who must have\r\npeopled this great town. an old man who appeared of Some note among\r\nthem and father to my guide brought foward a woman who was badly marked\r\nwith the Small Pox and made Signs that they all died with the disorder\r\nwhich marked her face, and which She was verry near dieing with when a\r\nGirl. from the age of this woman this Distructive disorder I judge must\r\nhave been about 28 or 30 years past, and about the time the Clatsops\r\ninform us that this disorder raged in their towns and distroyed their\r\nnation. Those people Speak a different language from those below tho in\r\ntheir dress habits and manners &c. they differ but little from the\r\nQuathlahpohtles. theire women ware the truss as those do of all the\r\nnations risideing from the quathlahpohtle to the enterance of Lewis's\r\nriver and on the Columbia above for Some distance. those people have\r\nSome words the Same with those below but the air of their language is\r\nentirely different, their men are Stouter and much better made, and\r\ntheir womin ware larger & longer robes than those do below; those are\r\nmost commonly made of Deer Skins dressed with the hair on them. they\r\npay great attention to their aged Severall men and women whom I\r\nobserved in this village had arived at a great age, and appeared to be\r\nhelthy tho blind. I provailed on an old man to draw me a Sketch of the\r\nMultnomar River ang give me the names of the nations resideing on it\r\nwhich he readily done, See draft on the other Side and gave me the\r\nnames Of 4 nations who reside on this river two of them very noumerous.\r\nThe first is Clark a-mus nation reside on a Small river which takes its\r\nrise in Mount Jefferson and falls into the Moltnomar about 40 miles up.\r\nthis nation is noumerous and inhabit 11 Towns. the 2d is the Cush-hooks\r\nwho reside on the N E. Side below the falls, the 3rd is the Char-cowah\r\nwho reside above the Falls on the S W. Side neether of those two are\r\nnoumerous. The fourth Nation is the Cal-lar-po-e-wah which is very\r\nnoumerous & inhabit the Country on each Side of the Multnomar from its\r\nfalls as far up as the knowledge of those people extend. they inform me\r\nalso that a high mountain passes the Multnomar at the falls, and above\r\nthe Country is an open plain of great extent.\r\n\r\nI purchased 5 dogs of those people for the use of their Oil in the\r\nPlains, and at 4 P M left the Village and proceeded on to Camp where I\r\njoind Capt. Lewis\r\n\r\nThe enterance of Multnomah river is 142 miles up the Columbia river\r\nfrom its enterance into the Pacific Ocean-. in my absence and Soon\r\nafter I left camp Several Canoes of men women and Children came to the\r\ncamp. and at one time there was about 37 of those people in Camp Capt\r\nLewis fired his Air gun which astonished them in Such a manner that\r\nthey were orderly and kept at a proper distance dureing the time they\r\nContinued with him--as maney as 10 Canoes arrived at Camp in the Course\r\nof this day. they all Seem to give the Same account of the Scercity of\r\nProvisions above. one family Continued all night and behaved themselves\r\nin a very orderly manner.\r\n\r\non the 3rd Joseph Field returned from the woods and informed the\r\nDrewyer Rubin & himself had killed four Elk. Capt L. Sent Sergt. Pryor\r\nand two men with Joseph Field to dry the flesh of the Elk in the woods\r\non Scaffolds with fire. the party bilow quick Sand river did not return\r\nto day. The Indians continue to vist our Camp in Considerable number\r\nfrom above with their families. these pore people appeared half\r\nStarved. they picked up the bones and little refuse meat which had been\r\nthrown away by the party. Capt L had the flesh of the 4 Elk which was\r\nkilled on the 1st inst. dried--Some of the men of the nativs who\r\nvisited Capt Lewis wore a girdle, with a Small Skin in front and a Cap\r\nof the Skin of the deers head &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 4, 1806]\r\nFriday April 4th 1806.\r\nThis morning early we sent Sergt. Ordway in Surch of Sergt. Gass and\r\nparty below the entrance of the Quicksand river fom whom we have yet\r\nhad no report. in the course of a few hours both parties returned.\r\nSergt. Gass and party brought the flesh of a bear and some venison.\r\nthey informed us that they had killed an Elk and six deer tho the flesh\r\nof the greater part of those animals was so meagre that it was unfit\r\nfor uce and they had therefore left it in the woods. Collins who had\r\nkilled the bear, found the bed of another in which there were three\r\nyoung ones; and requested to be permitted to return in order to waylay\r\nthe bed and kill the female bear; we permitted him to do so; Sergt.\r\nGass and Windsor returned with him. Several parties of the natives\r\nvisit us today as usual both from above and below; those who came from\r\nabove were moving with their families, and those from below appeared to\r\nbe empeled mearly by curiossity to see us. About noon we dispatched\r\nGibson Shannon Howard and Wiser in one of the light canoes, with orders\r\nto proceed up the Columbia to a large bottom on the South side about\r\nsix miles above us and to hunt untill our arrival. late in the evening\r\nJoseph Fields and Drewyer returned. they had killed two deer yesterday,\r\nand informed us that the meat would be dryed by midday tomorrow. we\r\ndirected Drewyer and the two Feildses to ascend the river tomorrow to\r\njoin Gibson and party, and hunt untill our arrival. this evening being\r\nfair I observed time and distance of Ys Eastern Limb from regulus with\r\nSextant. k West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 4, 1806]\r\nFriday April 4th 1806.\r\nMouth of quick Sand River\r\nThis morning early we Sent Sergt.

Gass and party brought the Flesh of a Bear, and Some venison.\r\nthey informed us they had killed an Elk and Six Deer tho the flesh of\r\nthe greater part of those Animals were So Meagre that it was unfit for\r\nuce, and they had therefore left it in the woods. Collins who had\r\nkilled the Bear, found the bead of another in which there was three\r\nyoung ones; and requested to be permited to return in order to waylay\r\nthe bed and kill the female bear; we permited him to do So; Sergt. Gass\r\nand Windser returned with him. Several parties of the nativs visit us\r\nto day as usial both from above and below; those who came from above\r\nwere moveing with their families, and those from below appeared to be\r\nimpeled mearly by curiosity to See us. About noon we dispatched Gibson,\r\nShannon, Howard & Wiser in one of the light Canoes, with orders to\r\nproceed up the Columbia to a large bottom on the South Side about Six\r\nMiles above us and there to hunt untill our arrival. late in the\r\nevening Jos Fields and Drewyer returned with a load of dried meat. they\r\nhad killed two deer yesterday and informed us that the meat would be\r\ndryed by Mid-day tomorrow. We directed Drewyer and Field's to assend\r\nthe river tomorrow and join Gibson & party, and hunt untill our\r\narrival. this evening being fair observed time and distance of moon's\r\nEastern Limb from regulus with Sextant * West\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 5, 1806]\r\nSaturday April 5th 1806.\r\nThis morning was so cloudy that I could not obtain any lunar\r\nobservations with a Aquila as I wished. Joseph Fields and Drewyer\r\ndeparted this morning agreeably to their orders of last evening. at 9\r\nA.M. we Sent Sergt. Ordway and a party to assist Sergt. Pryor in\r\nbringing in the meat of four Elk which he had dryed. at 1 P. M the\r\nparty returned with the meat. it had been so illy dryed that we feared\r\nit would not keep. we therefore directed it to be cut thinner and\r\nredryed over a fire this evening, as we purpose setting out early in\r\nthe morning. the deerskins which we have had cased for the purpose of\r\ncontaining our dryed meat are not themselves sufficiently dryed for\r\nthat purpose, we directed them to be dryed by the fire also. the\r\nweather has been so damp that there was no possibility of pounding the\r\nmeat as I wished.--we were visited today by several parties of the\r\nnatives as usual; they behaved themselves in a very orderly manner.\r\nObserved Magnetic Azimuth and altitude of the sun with Circumferenter\r\nand Sextant.\r\n\r\nSaw the Log cock, the hummingbird, gees ducks &c today. the tick has\r\nmade it's appearance it is the same with those of the Atlantic States.\r\nthe Musquetoes have also appeared but are not yet troublesome.--this\r\nmorning at 10 OClock Sergt. Gass returned with Collins and Windsor they\r\nhad not succeeded in killing the female bear tho they brought the three\r\ncubs with them. the Indians who visited us today fancyed these petts\r\nand gave us wappetoe in exchange for them.

The dogwood\r\ngrows abundantly on the uplands in this neighbourhood. it differs from\r\nthat of the United States in the appearance of it's bark which is much\r\nsmoother, it also arrives here to much greater size than I ever\r\nobserved it elsewhere sometimes the stem is nearly 2 feet in diameter.\r\nwe measured a fallen tree of fir No 1 which was 318 feet including the\r\nstump which was about 6 feet high. this tree was only about 31/2 feet\r\nin diameter. we saw the martin, small gees, the small speckled\r\nwoodpecker with a white back, the Blue crested Corvus, ravens, crows,\r\neagles Vultures and hawks. the mellow bug and long leged spider have\r\nappeared, as have also the butterfly blowing fly and many other\r\ninsects.

Gass returned with Collins\r\nand Windser they had not Succeeded in killing the female bear, tho they\r\nbrought the three cub's with them. the Indians who visited us to day\r\nfancied those Petts and gave us wappato in exchange for them. Fir and\r\nWhite Cedar is the common growth of the up lands, as is the Cotton\r\nwood, ash, large leafed Ash and Sweet Willow that of the bottom lands.\r\nThe Huckleberry, shallon, and the Several evergreen Shrubs, of that\r\nSpeces that bears berries have Seased to appear, except that Species\r\nwhich has the leaf with a prickley Margin. among the plants of this\r\nprarie in which we are encamped I observe the pashequo, Shannetahque,\r\nand Compound firn, the root of which the nativs eate; also the water\r\ncress, Straw berry flowering pea not yet in blume, narrow dock, and\r\nrush which are luxuriant and abundent in the river bottoms. the large\r\nleafed thorn has also disappeard. The red flowering Current is found\r\nhere in considerable quantities on the upland, and the Common Dog wood\r\nis found on either Side of the river in this neighbourhood and above\r\nMultnomah river. The Country on either Side is fertile, the bottom on\r\nthe South Side is wide and inter sperced with Small ponds in which the\r\nnativs gather their Wappato. back of this bottom the Country rises to\r\nabout 200 feet and the Soil is very rich as that also above q Sandy\r\nriver quite to the Mountains. the Country on the N. Side from a fiew\r\nMiles above this place as low down as the enterance of\r\nCah-wah-na-ki-ooks River rises to the hight generally of 150 or 200\r\nfeet is tolerably leavel, thickly timbered with Fir and White Cedar.\r\nthe Soil of the richest quallity. Some Small Praries on the bank of the\r\nriver. That portion of Country below as low down as the enterance of\r\nCah-wah na ki ooks River is a broken rich Country. the hills are high,\r\nthe bottom lands as before mentioned and fertile &c.-The Country a fiew\r\nmiles up the Multnomah River rises from the river bottoms to the hight\r\nof from 2 to 300 feet and is rich & fertile. Some Plains can be Seen to\r\nthe N. E. of our Camp of 10 or 12 miles in Secumference The Hunters &\r\nSerjt Pryor informed us that they had Measured a tree on the upper Side\r\nof quick Sand River 312 feet long and about 4 feet through at the Stump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 6, 1806]\r\nSunday April 6th 1806.\r\nThis morning we had the dryed meat secured in skins and the canoes\r\nloaded; we took breakfast and departed at 9 A.M. we continued up the N.\r\nside of the river nearly to the place at which we had encamped on the\r\n3rd of Nov. when we passed the river to the south side in quest of the\r\nhunters we had sent up yesterday and the day before. from the\r\nappearance of a rock near which we had encamped on the 3rd of November\r\nlast I could judge better of the rise of the water than I could at any\r\npoint below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet\r\nhigher than it was at that time; the river is here about 11/2 miles\r\nwide; it's general width from the beacon rock which may be esteemed the\r\nhead of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho\r\nin many places it is still wider. it is only in the fall of the year\r\nwhen the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the\r\nbeacon rock. this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of\r\nthe river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven\r\nhundred feet; it has some pine or reather fir timber on it's nothern\r\nside, the southern is a precipice of it's whole hight. it rises to a\r\nvery sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river. at the\r\ndistance of ten miles from our encampment we met with our hunters in\r\nthe upper end of the bottom to which we had directed them on the South\r\nside of the river. they had killed three Elk this morning and wounded\r\ntwo others so badly that they expected to get them. we therefore\r\ndetermined to encamp for the evening at this place in order to dry the\r\nmeat, in surch of which we sent a party immediately and employed others\r\nin preparing scaffoalds and collecting firewood &c against their\r\nreturn. we found some indians with our hunters when we arrived; these\r\npeople are constantly hanging about us.--As has been before mentioned\r\nCapt C set out with a party of seven men on 2ed inst. in surch of the\r\nentrance of the Multnomah river. he departed at 1/2 after 11 A. M and\r\ndirected his course along the Southern side of the river. at the\r\ndistance of 8 miles he passed the village of the Na-cha-co-lee tribe of\r\nthe E-lute Nation; this village is not large and being situated on the\r\nmain shore opposite to and S. of the Diamond Island it was concealed by\r\nthat island from our view both ascending and decending the Columbia as\r\nwe passed near the Northern shore. Capt C. passed this village without\r\nhalting and continued his rout untill 3 P.M. when he arrived at a large\r\ndouble house of the Ne-er-cho-ki-oo tribe of the Shah'ha-la nation; at\r\nthis place we had seen 24 additional straw and bark huts as we passed\r\ndown last fall, the inhabitants of which as I have before mentioned\r\nreside at the great rapids of the Columbia river. about this place in\r\ndifferent directions Capt C. saw a great number of small canoes lying\r\nscattered on the bank. these small canoes are employed by the women in\r\ncollecting wappetoe; with one of these a woman enters a pond where the\r\nSagitaria Sagittifolia grows frequently to her breast in water and by\r\nmeans of her toes and feet breakes the bulb of this plant loos from the\r\nparent radicle and disincumbering it from the mud it immediately rises\r\nto the surface of the water when she seizes it and throws it into her\r\ncanoe which she always keeps convenient to her. they will remain in the\r\nwater for hours together in surch of this bulb in middle of winter.\r\nthose canoes are from 10 to 14 feet in length, from 18 to 23 inches in\r\nwidth near the middle tapering or becoming narrower towards either\r\nextremity and 9 inches deep their form is thus. they are so light that\r\na woman can draw them over land or take them with ease through the\r\nswamps in any direction, and are sufficient to carry a single person\r\nand several bushells of roots. Capt. Clarks pilot informed him that the\r\nsmall canoes which he saw in the vicinity of this lodge were the\r\nproperty of the Shah-ha-las who used them occasionally when they visit\r\nthis neighbourhood for the purpose of collecting roots. while at this\r\nplace Capt C. entered one of the appartments of the house and offered\r\nseveral articles to the natives in exchange for wappetoe, they appeared\r\nto be in an ill humour and positively refused to let him have any.\r\nCapt. C. sat himself down near the fire and having a part of a portfire\r\nmatch in his pocket cut of a small peice of it and threw it in the\r\nfire; at the same time he took out his pocket compass and by means of a\r\nmagnet which he had in the top of his inkstand he turned the nedle of\r\nthe compass about very briskly; the match took fire and birned\r\nvehemently; the indians astonished and allarmed at these exhibitions,\r\nran and brought several parcels of wappetoe and laid at his feet and\r\nbegged that he would put out the bad fire; to this he consented; at\r\nthis moment the match being exhausted was of course extenguished and he\r\nput up his compass & magnet. they were now much more complisant, tho\r\nthe women and children were yet so much allarmed that they took refuge\r\nin their beads and behing the men who were seting opposite to Capt. C.\r\nduring the whole of this farcical seen an old man who was seting by\r\ncontinued to speak with great vehemence apparently imploring his god\r\nfor protection. Capt. C. gave them an adiquate compensation for their\r\nroots and having lighted his pipe smoaked with the men. they appeared\r\nin a great measure to get the better of their allarm and he left them\r\nand continued his rout along the south side of Image canoe Island which\r\nhe found to be three islands, the one in the center concealing the\r\napperture between the two others in such manner that from the north\r\nside of the river where we have previously passed they all appeared to\r\nform one island only. at the distance of 13 miles below the village\r\njust mentioned, and at the lower point of what we have heretofore\r\ndeemed the image canoe Island, Capt C. entered the Multnomah river so\r\ncalled by the natives from a nation of that name who reside on wappetoe\r\nisland a little below the entrance of this river? Multnomah river\r\ndischarges itself on the S. side of the Columbia 140 miles above the\r\nentrance of the latter into the Pacific Ocean, and may be justly\r\nesteemed one fourth of that noble river. Capt. C. found that this river\r\nhad attained it's greatest annual hight and had now fallen about 18\r\ninches. it has three small islands in it's mouth which conceal the\r\nriver from the view of those who pass with the stream of the Columbia.\r\nfrom the Columbia at the entrance of the Multonomah river Mount\r\nJefferson bears S. E. this is a noble mountain. I think equally as high\r\nas Mount St. Helines but it's distance being much greater than that of\r\nthe latter, so great a portion of it dose not appear above the range of\r\nmountains which lie betwen boath those stupendious mountains and this\r\npoint of view. like mount St. Heleans it's figure is a regular cone and\r\nis covered with eternal snow. M. St. Heleans from the same point boar N\r\n____, Mount Hood due East, and Mount Raniei nearly North. there is also\r\na very high humped mountain a little to the East of Mount St. Heleans\r\nwhich appears to lie in the same chain with those conic pointed\r\nmountains before mentioned. soon after Capt Clark entered the Multnomah\r\nriver he was met by an old Indian man alone in a canoe decending the\r\nriver, the pilot had some conversation with him and informed Capt. C.\r\nthat this was a man of the Clark-a'-mas nation who are numerous and\r\ninhabit eleven vilages on either side of a river of the same name which\r\nhas it's source in Mount Jefferson and after tranversing a woody and\r\nfertile country discharges itself into the Multnomah river on it's E.\r\nside at the distance of about 40 miles from it's junction with the\r\nColumbia. the Clarkamas river is navigable for canoes a great distance,\r\nfrom the Indian account almost to the foot of mount, Jefferson. the\r\nnation who inhabit it's borders live principally on fish with which\r\nthis stream abounds and also on roots which they procure on it's\r\nborders. they sometimes also come down to the Multnomah and Columbia in\r\nsurch of Wappatoe. they do not differ essentially in their language\r\ndress &c from the Quathlahpohtles and others in the vicinity of\r\nwappetoe island. The current of the Multnomah river is as gentle as\r\nthat of the Columbia, glides smoothly with an even surface, and appears\r\nto possess sufficient debth for the largest ship. Capt. C. attempted to\r\nsound it with a cord of 5 fathoms which was the longest in his\r\npossession but could not find bottom at this debth for at least one\r\nthird of the width of the river. Capt. C. ascended this river ten miles\r\nto a large wood house on the East side of the river, near which he\r\nencamped for the evening; the house being infested with such swarms of\r\nflees that they could not remain in it. this his guide informed him was\r\nthe house of the Cush-hooks nation who reside just below the falls of\r\nthe Multnomah river and who occasionally reside at this place for the\r\npurpose of collecting wappetoe. at present this house appeared to have\r\nbeen lately abandoned by the natives who had left therein exposed to\r\nevery visiter various articles such as small canoes, mats, bladders of\r\ntrain oil, baskets, bowls and trenchers. this is a strong evidence of\r\nthe honesty of the natives with rispect to the property of each other,\r\nbut they have given us several evidences that they do not pay the same\r\nrispect to the property of white men. his guide further informed him\r\nthat there were a number of small houses belonging to the last\r\nmentioned nation situated on two bayous which make out of the river a\r\nlittle above this large hose on the East side; that the inhabitants of\r\nthese as well as those of the large house had gone up to the falls of\r\nthe Multnomah river for the purpose of taking fish. these falls are\r\nsituated at the distance of 2 days travel from the junction of the\r\nMultnomah and Columbia rivers agreeably to the Indian account which we\r\nhave estimated at 60 miles or 20 m. above the entrance of Clarkamus\r\nriver. Capt C. took the dementions of the hose of the Ne-mal-quin-ner\r\ntribe of the Cushhooks nation near which he encamped on the 2ed inst.\r\nand found it presisely thirty feet by 40 squar constructed with broad\r\nboards and covered with the bark of the white cedar or arborvita; the\r\nfloor is on a level with the surface of the earth and the internal\r\narrangement is similar to those of the natives of the Sea coast.--these\r\npeople carry on a trafic with the Killamucks of the coast across the\r\nmountains and by way of the Killamucks river from the Killamucks they\r\nobtain their train oil. The courses and distances taken by Capt. Clark\r\nin ascending the Multnomah river from it's junction with the Columbia\r\nriver, commencing at the lower extremity of the Image canoe Islands are\r\nas follows. (viz) S. 30° W. 4 m. to the upper point of a small island in\r\nthe center of Multnomah river. thence S 10° W. 3 m. to a sluce 80 yds.\r\nwide on Stard. which dividing wappetoe Island from the main land\r\ndischarges itself into wappetoe inlet passed a willow point on Lard. S.\r\n60° W. 3 ms. to a large indian house on the Lard. side, just below some\r\nhigh fir land the shore is bold and high on Stard. side. S 30° E. 2 ms.\r\nto the center of a bend under The highlands on Stard. side, passing a\r\nLard. point; from hence the river directed it's course to the E. of S.\r\nE. as far as Capt. C. could perceive it.--at this place the Multnomah\r\nriver is 500 yds. wide and sufficiently deep to admit the largest ship.\r\nthe river appears to be washing away it's banks in some places, and has\r\nmore sandbars and willow points than the Columbia.On the morning of the\r\n3rd inst. Capt. Clark observed that the water had fallen in the course\r\nof the night about 5 inches. he set out early and proceeded up the\r\nriver a short distance few miles and attempted a second time to fathom\r\nit but with the same success as before he could nt find bottom with his\r\ncord of 5 fathoms for the distance of half the width of the stream.\r\nCapt C. having fully satisfyed himself of the magnitude of this great\r\nriver he set out on his return at 7 A.M. I have but little doubt but\r\nthat this river waters a vast tract of country lying between the\r\nWestern mountains and the mountainous country of the sea coast\r\nextending as far south as the waters of the gulph of Callifornia or\r\nabout Latitude 37° North. at 11 A.M. Capt. C. arrived at the\r\nNe-er-cho-ki-oo house where he had allarmed the inhabtants yesterday.\r\nhe halted here a few minutes to smoke with these people who consisted\r\nof eight families. he found that his presents excited fresh allarm\r\nparticularly among the women and children who hid themselves and took\r\nrefuge behind the men as yesterday; the men held down their heads and\r\nseemed much conserned; he therefore remained in the house but a few\r\nminutes, returned to his canoe and pursued his rout. his pilot now\r\ninformed him that these people as well as their relations at the falls\r\nof the Columbia were illy disposed bad men. soon after he set out he\r\nmet five canoes on board of which there were as many families of the\r\nShah-ha-la nation decending the river in surch of subsistence. they\r\nwere extreemly anxious to come along side, but he forbid their doing so\r\nas their number was too considerable there being 21 men on board these\r\ncanoes. his pilot told him that they were mischevous bad men. at 3 P.M.\r\nhe arrived at the present residence of his pilot on the South side of\r\nthe river opposite the Diamond Island. here he halted about an hour he\r\nfound this house very large; it consisted of seven appartments in one\r\nrange above ground each about 30 feet square. the entrances to these\r\nappartments were from passages which extended quite across the house,\r\nabout 4 feet wide and formed like the walls of the hose of broad boards\r\nset on end extending from beneath the floor to the roof of the house.\r\nthe apperture or hole through which they enter all those wooden houses\r\nare remarkably small not generally more than 3 feet high and about 22\r\ninches wide. the ground plot of the Nechecolee house is thus 1 1 1 1\r\nthe passages of 4 feet and 2 2 &c. the appartments of 30 feet square.\r\nthis house is covered with the bark of the white cedar, laid on in a\r\ndouble course, supported by rafters and longitudinal round poles\r\nattatched to the rafters with cores of this bark. the peices of the\r\ncedar bark extend the whole length of the side of the roof and jut over\r\nat the eve about 18 inches. at the distance of 18 inches transverse\r\nsplinters of dry fir is inserted through the cedar bark in order to\r\nkeep it smooth and prevent it's edges from colapsing by the heat of the\r\nsun; in this manner the natives make a very secure light and lasting\r\nroof of this bark. in the vicinity of this house Capt. Clark observed\r\nthe remains of five other large houses which appeared to have been sunk\r\nin the ground several feet and built after the method of those of the\r\nElutes nation at the great narrows of the columbia with whom these\r\npeople claim affinity. their language is the same with the Elutes, tho\r\nin their habits, dress manners &c they differ but little from the\r\nQuathlahpohtles and others in this neighborhood. they make use of some\r\nwords common to their neighbours but the air of their language is\r\nentirely different. they are much better formed and their men larger\r\nthan the nations below. their women wear larger and longer robes which\r\nare made principally of deerskins dressed in the hair. they pay great\r\nrispect to their aged persons. Capt. C. observed several persons of\r\nboth sexes who appeared to have arrived to great age yet they appeared\r\nperfectly healthy tho most of them perfectly blind. the loss of sight I\r\nhave observed to be more common among all the nations inhabiting this\r\nriver than among any people I ever observed. they have almost\r\ninvariably soar eyes at all stages of life. the loss of an eye is very\r\ncommon among them; blindness in perdsons of middle age is by no means\r\nuncommon, and it is almost invariably a concommitant of old age. I know\r\nnot to what cause to attribute this prevalent deficientcy of the eyes\r\nexcept it be their exposure to the reflection of the sun on the water\r\nto which they are constantly exposed in the occupation of fishing.\r\nCapt. C. enquired of the Nechecole the cause of the decline of their\r\nvillage. an old man who appeared to be of some note among them and the\r\nfather of his guide brought forward a woman who was much marked with\r\nthe small pox, and made signs that the inhabitants of those houses\r\nwhich he saw in ruins had all died with the disorder which marked the\r\nface of the woman and with which this woman was very near dying when a\r\ngirl. from the apparent age of the woman Capt. C. supposed that it was\r\nabout 28 or 30 years since this disorder had prevailed among these\r\npeople. this is about the time which we have supposed that it prevailed\r\namong the Clatsops and others of the coast. Capt C. now prevailed on\r\nthis old man to give him a sketch of the Multnomah river it's branches\r\nand the position and names of the Indian nations residing thereon this\r\nthe old man son executed with his finger in the dust. (see scetch\r\ninserted on the 3rd inst.). he informed that the Cush-hooks and\r\nChar-cow-ah nations who reside at the falls of that river were not\r\nnumerous; but that the Cal-lah-po-e-wah nation who inhabited both sides\r\nof this river above the falls as far as it was known to himself or his\r\nnation were very numerous. that the country they inhabited was level\r\nand wholy destitute of timber. that a high range of mountains passed\r\nthe Multnomah river at the falls, on the upperside of which the country\r\nwas one vast plain. the nations who inhabit this country reside on the\r\nrivers and subsist like those of the Columbia on fish and roots\r\nprincipally. Capt C. bought five dogs of these people and set out for\r\nmy camp at 5 P.M. where he arrived a little before dark, on the evening\r\nof the third.--the party whom we sent for the flesh of the Elk which\r\nShannon had killed returned in the evening with that of four, one had\r\nby some mistake been omitted. Drewyer and shannon found the two wounded\r\nElk and had killed them. we set all hands at work to prepare the meat\r\nfor the saffoald they continued their operations untill late at night.\r\nwe directed Shannon to go out early in the morning with a party to\r\nbring in the Elk which had been left last evening in mistake. we also\r\ndirected Drewyer and the two Feildses to ascend the river early in the\r\nmorning to a small bottom a few miles above and hunt untill our\r\narrival.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 6, 1806]\r\nSunday April 6th 1806.\r\nTwo Indians Came last night very late to our Camp and continued all\r\nnight. early we had all the meat packed up and our Canoes loaded ready\r\nfor to Set out and after an early brackfast at which time all things\r\nwere ready and we Set out and proceeded to the Camp of Gibson & party\r\nabout 9 miles, they had killed 3 Elk at no great distance and Wounded\r\ntwo others so badly that we expect to precure them. Sent a party of Six\r\nmen with Shannon who had killed the Elk to bring in the Elk, and formed\r\na Camp, near which we had a Scaffold made ready to dry the meat as Soon\r\nas it Should arive. Reubin Field killed a bird of the Quail kind or\r\nClass which was whistleing near our Camp it is larger than the quail or\r\npartridge as they are Called Kentucky and Virginia. it's form is\r\npresisely that of our partridge tho its plumage differs in every part.\r\nthe upper part of the head, Sides and back of the neck, including the\r\nCroop and about of the under part of the body is of a bright dove\r\ncoloured blue, under neath the under beak, as high as the lower edge of\r\nthe eye, and back as far as the hinder part of the eyes and thence\r\ncomeing down to a point in the front of the neck about 2/3rd of it's\r\nlength downwards, is of a fine dark brick red. between this brick red\r\nand the dove colour there runs a narrow Stripe of pure white. the ears\r\nare covered with some coarse dark brown feathers. just at the base of\r\nthe under chap there is a narrow transvirce Stripe of white. from the\r\ncrown of the head two long round feathers extend backwards nearly in\r\nthe direction of the beak and are of a black Colour. the length of\r\nthese feathers is 21/2 inches. one overlais and Conseals the other\r\nwhich is Somewhat Shorter and Seems to be raped in the plumage of that\r\nin front which folding backwards colapses behing and has a round\r\nappearance. the tail is composed of 12 dark brown feathers of nearly\r\nequal length. the large feathers of the wings are of a dark brown & are\r\nreather Short in purpotion to the body of the bird. in this respect\r\nvery Similar to the partridge. the covert of the wings and back are of\r\na dove Colour with a Slight admixture of redish brown. a wide Stripe\r\nwhich extends from Side to Side of the body and occupies the lower\r\nregion of the breast is beautifully varigated with the brick red white\r\n& black which perdominates in the order they are mentioned and the\r\nColours mark the feathers transversely. the legs are covered with\r\nfeathers as low as the Knee; these feathers are of dark brown tiped\r\nwith a dark brick red as are also those between and about the joining\r\nof the legs with the body. the foot is presisely that of the Common\r\npartridge except that they are as also the legs white. the upper beak\r\nis Short, wide at it's base, black, convex, curved downwards and\r\nreather obtusely pointed. it exceeds the under chap considerably which\r\nis of a white colour, also convex under neath and obtusely pointed. the\r\nnostrils are remarkably Small, placed far back and low down on the\r\nSides of the beak. they are covered by a thin proterant elastic, black\r\nleather like Substance. the eyes are of a uniform pierceing black\r\ncolour. this is a most butifull bird I preserved the Skin of this bird\r\nretaining the wings feet & head which I hope will give a just Idea of\r\nthe bird. it's loud note is Single and Consists of a loud Squall,\r\nintirely different from the whistling of our partridge or quailes. it\r\nhas a chiping note when allarmed like our partridge.--to day there was\r\na Second of those birds killed which presisely resembles that just\r\ndiscribed. I believe those to be the mail bird the female, if so, I\r\nhave not yet Seen.-.\r\n\r\nat 6 P.M. Shannon and party returned with the flesh of five Elk. the\r\ntwo he had wounded in the morning he found dead near the place he had\r\nShot them. we had the meat cut into thin pices and Scaffored with a\r\nfire under it to dry out, which we expect in the course of the night\r\nCan be effected. four Indians from the great rapids visited us to day\r\nand Continued all day. they give the Same account of the Scercity of\r\nprovisions above the falls as has already been given by others. This\r\nSupply of Elk I think by useing economey and in addition of roots and\r\ndogs which we may probably precure from he Nativs on Lewis's river will\r\nbe Sufficient to last us to the Chopunnish where we Shall Meet with our\r\nhorses-. and near which place there is Some deer to be precured.\r\n\r\nFrazer killed a pheasent of the Common kind. Jos. Field killed a\r\nvulture of that Speces already discribed. in the evening late the\r\nIndians left us and returned to their village. we detected that fires\r\nbe kept under the meat all night. and tha Drewyer and the two Fields\r\nproceed on to the next bottom and hunt untill we Should arive. 9 miles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 7, 1806]\r\nMonday April 7th 1806.\r\nThis morning early the flesh of the remaining Elk was brought in and\r\nDrewyer with the Feildses departed agreeably to the order of the last\r\nevening. we employed the party in drying the meat today which we\r\ncompleted by the evening, and we had it secured in dryed Elkskins and\r\nput on board in readiness for an early departure. we were visited today\r\nby several parties of indians from a village about 8 miles above us of\r\nthe Sahhalah nation. I detected one of them in steeling a peice of lead\r\nand sent him from camp. I hope we have now a sufficient stock of dryed\r\nmeat to serve us as far the Chopunnish provided we can obtain a few\r\ndogs horses and roots by the way. in the neighbourhood of the\r\nChopunnish we can procure a few deer and perhaps a bear or two for the\r\nmountains. last evening Reubin Fields killed a bird of the quail kind\r\nit is reather larger than the quail, or partridge as they are called in\r\nVirginia. it's form is precisely that of our patridge tho it's plumage\r\ndiffers in every part. the upper part of the head, sides and back of\r\nthe neck, including the croop and about 1/3 of the under part of the\r\nbody is of a bright dove coloured blue, underneath the under beak, as\r\nhigh as the lower edge of the eyes, and back as far as the hinder part\r\nof the eyes and thence coming down to a point in front of the neck\r\nabout two thirds of it's length downwards, is of a fine dark brick red.\r\nbetween this brick red and the dove colour there runs a narrow stripe\r\nof pure white. the ears are covered with some coarse stiff dark brown\r\nfeathers. just at the base of the under chap there is narrow transverse\r\nstripe of white. from the crown of the head two long round feathers\r\nextend backwards nearly in the direction of the beak and are of a black\r\ncolour. the longest of these feathers is two inches and an half, it\r\noverlays and conceals the other which is somewhat shorter and seems to\r\nbe raped in the plumage of that in front which folding backwards\r\ncolapses behind and has a round appearance. the tail is composed of\r\ntwelve dark brown feathers of nearly equal length. the large feathers\r\nof the wings are of a dark brown and are reather short in proportion to\r\nthe body of the bird in that rispect very similar to our common\r\npartridge. the covert of the wings and back are of a dove colour with a\r\nslight admixture of redish brown. a wide stripe which extends from side\r\nto side of the body and occupyes the lower region of the breast is\r\nbeautifully variagated with the brick red white and black which\r\npedominate in the order they are mentioned and the colours mark the\r\nfeathers transversely. the legs are covered with feathers as low as the\r\nknee; these feathers are of a dark brown tiped with the dark brick red\r\nas are also those between and about the joining of the legs with the\r\nbody. they have four toes on each foot of which three are in front and\r\nthat in the center the longest, those one each side nearly of a length;\r\nthat behing is also of good length and are all armed with long and\r\nstrong nails. the legs and feet are white and imbrecated with\r\nproportionably large broad scales. the upper beak is short, wide at\r\nit's base, black, convex, curved downwards and reather obtusely\r\npointed. it exceeds the under chap considerably which is of a white\r\ncolour, also convex underneath and obtusely pointed. the nostrils are\r\nremarkably small placed far back and low down on the sides of the beak.\r\nthey are covered by a thin protuberant elastic, black leatherlike\r\nsubstance. the eyes are of a uniform piercing black colour. this is a\r\nmost beautifull bird. I preserved the skin of this bird retaining the\r\nwings feet and head which I hope will give a just idea of the bird.\r\nit's loud note is single and consists of a loud squall, intirely\r\ndifferent from the whistling of our quales or partridge. it has a\r\ncherping note when allarmed something like ours.--today there was a\r\nsecond of these birds killed by Capt C. which precisely resembled that\r\njust discribed. I believe these to be the male bird the female, if so,\r\nI have not yet seen.--the day has been fair and weather extreemly\r\npleasant. we made our men exercise themselves in shooting today and\r\nregulate their guns found several of them that had their sights moved\r\nby accedent, and others that wanted some little alterations all which\r\nwere compleatly rectifyed in the course of the day. in the evening all\r\nthe Indians departed for their village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 7, 1806]\r\nMonday April 7th 1806\r\nThis morning Drewyer & the two Fields Set out agreeably to their orders\r\nof last evening, the remainder of the party employed in drying the\r\nflesh of the five Elk killed by Shannon yesterday. which was completed\r\nand we had it Secured in dried Shaved Elk Skins and put on board in\r\nreadiness for our early departure. we were visited by Several parties\r\nof Indians from a Village about 12 miles above us of the Sahhalah\r\nnation. one of them was detected in Stealing a piece of Lead. I Sent\r\nhim off imedeately. I hope now we have a Sufficient Stock of dryed meat\r\nto Serve us as far as the Chopunnish provided we can obtain a fiew\r\ndogs, horses and roots by the way. in the neighbourhood of the\r\nChopunnish under the Rocky Mountains we can precure a fiew deer, and\r\nperhaps a Bear or two for the Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe day has been fair and weather exceedingly pleasent. we made our men\r\nexersise themselves in Shooting and regulateing their guns, found\r\nSeveral of them that had their Sights moved by accident, and others\r\nthat wanted Some little alterations all which were compleated rectified\r\nin the Course of the day except my Small rifle, which I found wanted\r\nCutting out. about 4 oClock P M all the Indians left us, and returned\r\nto their Village. they had brought with them Wappato, & pashequa roots\r\nChapellel cakes, and a Species of Raspberry for Sale, none of which\r\nthey disposed of as they asked Such enormous prices for those articles\r\nthat we were not able to purchase any. Drewyer returned down the river\r\nin the evening & informed us that the nativs had Sceared all the Elk\r\nfrom the river above. Joseph & reuben Fields had proceeded on further\r\nup the river in the canoe, he expected to the village.\r\n\r\nI provaled on an old indian to mark the Multnomah R down on the Sand\r\nwhich hid and perfectly Corisponded with the Sketch given me by sundary\r\nothers, with the addition of a circular mountain which passes this\r\nriver at the falls and connects with the mountains of the Seacoast. he\r\nalso lais down the Clark a mos passing a high Conical Mountain near\r\nit's mouth on the lower Side and heads in Mount Jefferson which he lais\r\ndown by raiseing the Sand as a very high mountain and Covered with\r\neternal Snow. the high mountain which this Indian lais down near the\r\nenterance of Clark a mos river, we have not Seen as the hills in it's\r\ndiretion from this vally is high and obscures the Sight of it from us.\r\nMt Jefferson we Can plainly See from the enterance of Multnomah from\r\nwhich place it bears S. E. this is a noble Mountain and I think equally\r\nas high or Something higher than Mt. St. Heleansa but its distance\r\nbeing much greater than that of the latter, So great a portion of it\r\ndoes not appear above the range of mountains which lie between both\r\nthose Stupendious Mountains and the Mouth of Multnomah. like Mt. St.\r\nHeleans its figure is a regular Cone and is covered with eturnial Snow.\r\nthat the Clarkamos nation as also those at the falls of the Multnomah\r\nlive principally on fish of which those Streams abound and also on\r\nroots which they precure on it's borders, they also Sometimes Come down\r\nto the Columbia in Serch of Wappato. they build their houses in the\r\nSame form with those of the Columbian Vally of wide Split boads and\r\nCovered with bark of the White Cedar which is the entire length of the\r\none Side of the roof and jut over at the eve about 18 inches. at the\r\ndistance of about 18 inches transvers Spinters of dried pine is\r\ninserted through the Ceder bark inorder to keep it Smooth and prevent\r\nit's edge from Colapsing by the heat of the Sun; in this manner the\r\nnativs make a very Secure light and lasting roof of this bark. which we\r\nhave observed in every Vilege in this Vally as well as those above.\r\nthis Indian also informed me the multnomah above the falls was Crouded\r\nwith rapids and thickly inhabited by indians of the Callah-po-e-wah\r\nNation. he informed he had himself been a long way up that river &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 8, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 8th 1806.\r\nThe wind blew so violently this morning that we were obliged to unlode\r\nour perogues and canoes, soon after which they filled with water. being\r\ncompelled to remain during the day at our present station we sent out\r\nsome hunters in order to add something to our stock of provision; and\r\nexposed our dryed meat to the sun and the smoke of small fires. in the\r\nevening the hunters returned having killed a duck only; they saw two\r\nbear and some of the blacktailed jumping or fallow deer, such as are\r\nfound about Fort Clatsop; this kind of deer are scarce in this\r\nneighbourhood, the common longtailed fallow deer being most abundant.\r\nwe have seen the black bear only in this quarter. the wind continued\r\nwithout intermission to blow violently all day. I took a walk today of\r\nthree miles down the river; in the course of which I had an opportunity\r\nto correct an errow which I have heretofore made with rispect to the\r\nshrub I have hithertoo called the large leafed thorn. the leaf of this\r\nthorn is small being only abut 21/2 inches long, is petiolate,\r\nconjugate; the leafets are petiolate accutely pointed, having their\r\nmargins cut with unequal angular insissures. the shrub which I have\r\nheretofore confounded with this grows in similar situations, has a stem\r\nprecisely like it except the thorn and bears a large three loabed leaf.\r\nthis bryer is of the class Polyandria and order Polygynia. the flowers\r\nare single, the peduncle long and celindric. the calix is a perianth,\r\nof one leaf, five cleft, & accutely pointed. the perianth is proper,\r\nerect, inferior with rispect to both petals and germen, and equal. the\r\ncorolla consists of five accute pale scarlet petals, insirted in the\r\nrecepticle with a short and narrow claw. the Corolla is smooth,\r\nmoderately long, situated at the base of the germen, permanent, and cup\r\nshaped. of the stamens the filaments are subulate, inserted into the\r\nrecepticle, unequal and bent inwards concealing the pistillum; anther\r\ntwo loabed and inflected situated on the top of the fillaments of the\r\npistillum the germ is conical, imbricated, superior, sessile and short.\r\nthe styles are short with rispect to the stamen, capillary smooth,\r\nobtuse, distributed over the serface of the germ and decid-uous. no\r\nperseptable stigma.--late at night the centinel detected an old indian\r\nman in attempting to creep into camp in order to pilfer; he allarmed\r\nthe indian very much by presenting his gun at him; he gave the fellow a\r\nfew stripes with a switch and sent him off. this fellow is one of a\r\nparty of six who layed incamped a few hundred yards below us, they\r\ndeparted soon after this occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 8, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 8th 1806\r\nThis morning about day light I heard a Considerable roreing like wind\r\nat a distance and in the Course of a Short time ways rose very high\r\nwhich appeared to come across the river and in the Course of an hour\r\nbecame So high that we were obliged to unload the canoes, at 7 oClock\r\nA.M. the winds Suelded and blew So hard and raised the Waves So\r\nemensely high from the N. E and tossed our Canoes against the Shore in\r\nSuch a manner as to render it necessary to haul them up on the bank.\r\nfinding from the appearance of the winds that it is probable that we\r\nmay be detained all day, we Sent out Drewyer, Shannon Colter & Collins\r\nto hunt with derections to return if the Wind Should lul, if not to\r\nContinue the hunt all day except they killed Elk or bear Sooner &c. we\r\nhad the dried meat which was cured at our last encampment below exposed\r\nto the Sun. John Shields Cut out my Small rifle & brought hir to Shoot\r\nvery well. the party ows much to the injenuity of this man, by whome\r\ntheir guns are repared when they get out of order which is very often.\r\n\r\nI observed an Indian Woman who visited us yesterday blind of an eye,\r\nand a man who was nearly blind of both eyes. the loss of Sight I have\r\nobserved to be more Common among all the nations inhabiting this river\r\nthan among any people I ever observed. they have almost invariably Sore\r\neyes at all Stages of life. the loss of an eye is very Common among\r\nthem; blindness in persons of middle age is by no means uncommon, and\r\nit is almost invariably a concammitant of old age. I Know not to what\r\ncause to attribute this prevalent deficientcy of the eye except it be\r\ntheir exposure to the reflection of the Sun on the water to which they\r\nare constantly exposed in the Occupation of fishing. about 1 P M\r\nCollins Shannon and Colter returned. Collins Saw 2 bear but could not\r\nget a Shot at them. neither Shannon nor Colter Saw any thing worth\r\nShooting. Soon after Drewyer returned haveing only a Summer Duck. the\r\nElk is gorn to the mountains as the hunters Suppose. in the evening\r\nlate an old man his Son & Grand Son and their Wives &c. Came down\r\ndureing the time the waves raged with great fury. the wife of the Grand\r\nSon is a woman of differant appearance from any we have Seen on this\r\nriver, she has a very round head and pierceing black eyes. Soon after\r\nthose people arived the Old man was detected in Stealing a Spoon and he\r\nwas ordered away, at about 200 yards below our Camp they built\r\nthemselves a fire and did not return to our fires after-. The Wind\r\nContinued violently hard all day, and threw our Canoes with Such force\r\nagainst the Shore that one of them Split before we Could get it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 9, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 9th 1806.\r\nThis morning early we commenced the operation of reloading our canoes;\r\nat 7 A.M. we departed and proceeded on to the Camp of Reubin and Joseph\r\nFields they had not killed any game; we made no halt at this place but\r\ncontinued our rout to the Wah-clel-lah Village which is situated on the\r\nNorth side of the river about a mile below the beacon rock; here we\r\nhalted and took breakfast. John Colter one of our party observed the\r\ntomehawk in one of the lodges which had been stolen from us on the 4th\r\nof November last as we decended this river; the natives attempted to\r\nwrest the tomahawk from him but he retained it. they indeavoured\r\nafterwards to exculpate themselves from the odium of having stolen it,\r\nthey alledged that they had bought it from the natives below; but their\r\nneighbours had several days previously, informed us that these people\r\nhad stolen the Tommehawk and then had it at their village. this village\r\nappears to be the winter station of the Wah-clel-lahs and Clahclellars,\r\nthe greater part of the former have lately removed to the falls of the\r\nMultnomah, and the latter have established themselves a few miles above\r\non the North side of the river opposite the lower point of brant\r\nisland, being the commencement of the rapids, here they also take their\r\nsalmon; they are now in the act of removing, and not only take with\r\nthem their furniture and effects but also the bark and most of the\r\nboards which formed their houses. 14 houses remain entire but are at\r\nthis time but thinly inhabited, nine others appear to have been lately\r\nremoved, and the traces of ten or twelve others of ancient date were to\r\nbe seen in the rear of their present village. they sometimes sink their\r\nhouses in the earth, and at other times have their floors level with\r\nthe surface of the earth; they are generally built with boards and\r\ncovered with Cedar bark. most of them have a devision in their houses\r\nnear the entrance wich is at the end or in the event of it's bing a\r\ndouble house is from the center of a narrow passage. several families\r\ninhabit one appartment. the women of these people pierce the cartelage\r\nof the nose in which they wear various ornaments in other rispects they\r\ndo not differ from those in the neighbourhood of the Diamond island;\r\ntho most of the women brad their hair which hanges in two tresses one\r\nhanging over each ear. these people were very unfriendly, and seemed\r\nilly disposed had our numbers not detered them any acts of violence.\r\nwith some difficuly we obtained five dogs from them and a few wappetoe.\r\non our way to this village we passed several beautifull cascades which\r\nfell from a great hight over the stupendious rocks which cloles the\r\nriver on both sides nearly, except a small bottom on the South side in\r\nwhich our hunters were encamped. the most remarkable of these casscades\r\nfalls about 300 feet perpendicularly over a solid rock into a narrow\r\nbottom of the river on the south side. it is a large creek, situated\r\nabout 5 miles above our encampment of the last evening. several small\r\nstreams fall from a much greater hight, and in their decent become a\r\nperfect mist which collecting on the rocks below again become visible\r\nand decend a second time in the same manner before they reach the base\r\nof the rocks. the hills have now become mountains high on each side are\r\nrocky steep and covered generally with fir and white cedar. we saw some\r\nturkey buzzards this morning of the speceis common to the United states\r\nwhich are the first we have seen on this side the rocky mountains.\r\nduring our halt at this village the grand Cheif and two inferior Cheifs\r\nof the Chil-luck-kit-to-quaw nation arrived with several men and women\r\nof their nation in two large canoes. these people were on their return\r\nup the river, having been on a trading voyage to the Columbean vally,\r\nand were loaded with wappetoe dryed anchovies, with some beads &c which\r\nthey had received in exchange for dryed and pounded salmon shappelell\r\nbeargrass &c. These people had been very kind to us as we decended the\r\nriver we therefore smoked with them and treated them with every\r\nattention. at 2 P.M. we renewed our voyage; passed under the beacon\r\nrock on the north side, to the left of two small islands situated near\r\nthe shore. at four P.M. we arrived at the Clah-clel-lah village; here\r\nwe found the natives busily engaged in erecting their new habitations,\r\nwhich appear to be reather of a temperary kind; it is most probable\r\nthat they only reside here during the salmon season. we purchased two\r\ndogs of these people who like those of the village blow were but sulky\r\nand illy disposed; they are great rogues and we are obliged to keep\r\nthem at a proper distance from our bag-gage. as we could not ascend the\r\nrapid by the North side of the river with our large canoes, we passed\r\nto the oposite side and entered the narrow channel which seperates\r\nbrant Island from the South shore; the evening being far spent and the\r\nwind high raining and very cold we thought best not to attempt the\r\nrapids this evening, we therefore sought a safe harbour in this narrow\r\nchannel and encamped on the main shore. our small canoe with Drewer and\r\nthe two feildses was unable to pass the river with us in consequence of\r\nthe waves they therefore toed her up along the N. side of the river and\r\nencamped opposite the upper point of brant Island. after halting this\r\nevening I took a turn with my gun in order to kill a deer, but was\r\nunsuccessfull. I saw much fresh sign. the fir has been lately injured\r\nby a fire near this place and many of them have discharged considerable\r\nquantities of rozin. we directed that Collins should hunt a few hours\r\ntomorrow morning and that Gibson and his crew should remain at his\r\nplace untill we returned and employ themselves in collectng rozin which\r\nour canoes are now in want of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 9, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 9th 1806\r\nlast night at a late hour the old amsiated Indian who was detected in\r\nStealing a Spoon yesterday, Crept upon his belley with his hands and\r\nfeet, with a view as I Suppose to take Some of our baggage which was in\r\nSeveral defferent parcels on the bank. the Sentinal observed the\r\nmotions of this old amcinated retch untill he got with a fiew feet of\r\nthe baggage at he hailed him and approached with his gun in a possion\r\nas if going to Shoote which allarmed the old retch in Such a manner\r\nthat he ran with all his power tumbleing over brush and every thing in\r\nhis way. at 7 A.M. we Set out and proceeded on to the Camp of Joseph &\r\nReubin Fields. they had killed nothing. here we did not delay but\r\nproceeded on to Wah-clel-lah Village on the North Side and brackfast\r\nhere one the men Colter observed the Tomahawk which was Stolen from on\r\nthe 4th of Novr. last as we decended the Columbia, he took the tomahawk\r\nthe natives attempted to wrest it from him, he held fast the Tomahawk.\r\nThose people attempted to excuse themselves from odium of Stealing it,\r\nby makeing Signs that they had purchased the Tomahawk, but their\r\nnighbours informed me otherwise and made Signs that they had taken it.\r\nThis Village appears to be the wintering Station of two bands of the\r\nShah-ha-la Nation. One band has already moved the Falls of the\r\nMultnomah which is the place they take their Salmon. The other band is\r\nnow moveing a fiew miles above to the foot of the first rapid on this\r\nriver, at which place they take their Salmon. 14 houses only appear\r\noccupied and the inhabitants of those moveing off hourly, they take\r\nwith them in their Canoes independent of all their houshold effects the\r\nbark of their houses, and boards. 9 houses has been latterly abandened\r\nand 14 others is yet is thinly inhabited at present, and the remains of\r\n10 or 12 others are to be Seen and appears to have been enhabited last\r\nfall. those people were not hospital and with Some dificuelty we\r\nprecured 5 dogs and a fiew Wappato of them. Soon after we arived at\r\nthis Village the Grand Cheif and two others of the\r\nChee-luck-kit-le-quaw Nation arived from below. they had with them 11\r\nmen and 7 womin and had been trading in the Columbia Vally for Wappato,\r\nbeeds and dried Anchovies &c in exchange for which they had given\r\npounded fish Shappalell, bear grass, acorns boiled berries &c. &c. and\r\nare now on their return to their village. as those people had been very\r\nKind to us as we decended the river we gave them Smoke. at 2 oClock P.\r\nM we Set out and passed under the Beacon rock on the North Side of two\r\nSmall Islds. Situated nearest the N. side. at 4 P.M. we arived at the\r\nfirst rapid at the head of Straw berry island at which place on the N\r\nW. Side of the Columbia here we found the nativs from the last village\r\nrebuilding their habitations of the bark of their old Village 16 Huts\r\nare already Compleated and appear only temporrary it is most probable\r\nthat they only reside here dureing the Season of the Salmon. as we\r\nCould not pass with the large Canoes up the N. W. Side for the rocks,\r\nthe wind high and a rainey disagreeable evining. our Smallest Canoe\r\nbeing too low to cross through the high waves, we Sent her up on the N\r\nW. Side with Drewyer and the two Fields and after purchaseing 2 dogs\r\nCrossed and into the Sluce of a large high Island seperated from the S.\r\nE Side by a narrow chanel, in this chanel we found a good harbor and\r\nencamped on the lower Side. We Saw Some deer Sign and Collins to hunt\r\nin the mornig untill the Canoes were toed above the rapids. made 16\r\nMiles to day. evening wet & disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 10, 1806]\r\nThursday April 10th 1806.\r\nWe set out early and droped down the channel to the lower end of brant\r\nIsland from whence we drew them up the rapid by a cord about a quarter\r\nof a mile which we soon performed; Collins and Gibson not having yet\r\ncome over we directed Sergt. Pryor to remain with the cord on the\r\nIsland untill Gibson arrived and assist him with his crew in geting his\r\ncanoe up the rapid, when they were to join us on the oposite side at a\r\nsmall village of six houses of the Clah-clah'lahs where we halted for\r\nbreakfast. in passing the river which is here about 400 yds. wide the\r\nrapidity of the currant was such that it boar us down a considerable\r\ndistance notwithstanding we employed five oars. on entering one of\r\nthese lodges, the natives offered us a sheepskin for sail, than which\r\nnothing could have been more acceptable except the animal itself. the\r\nskin of the head of the sheep with the horns remaining was cased in\r\nsuch manner as to fit the head of a man by whom it was woarn and highly\r\nprized as an ornament. we obtained this cap in exchange for a knife,\r\nand were compelled to give two Elkskins in exchange for the skin. this\r\nappeared to be the skin of a sheep not fully grown; the horns were\r\nabout four inches long, celindric, smooth, black, erect and pointed;\r\nthey rise from the middle of the forehead a little above the eyes. they\r\noffered us a second skin of a full grown sheep which was quite as large\r\nas that of a common deer. they discovered our anxity to purchase and in\r\norder to extort a great plrice declared that they prized it too much to\r\ndispose of it. in expectation of finding some others of a similar kind\r\nfor sale among the natives of this neighbourhood I would not offer him\r\na greater price than had been given for the other which he refused.\r\nthese people informed us that these sheep were found in great abundance\r\non the hights and among the clifts of the adjacent mountains. and that\r\nthey had lately killed these two from a herd of 36, at no great\r\ndistance from their village. we could obtain no provision from those\r\npeople except four white salmon trout. at ten oclock Sergt. Pryor and\r\nGibson joined us with Collins who had killed 3 deer. these were all of\r\nthe blacktailed fallow kind. we set out and continued our rout up the\r\nN. side of the river with great difficulty in consequence of the\r\nrapidity of the current and the large rocks which form this shore; the\r\nSouth side of the river is impassable. as we had but one sufficient\r\ntoerope and were obliged to employ the cord in geting on our canoes the\r\ngreater part of the way we could only take them one at a time which\r\nretarded our progress very much. by evening we arrived at the portage\r\non the North side where we landed and conveyed our bagage to the top of\r\nthe hill about 200 paces distant where we formed a camp. we had the\r\ncanoes drawn on shore and secured. the small canoe got loose from the\r\nhunters and went a drift with a tin vessel and tommahawk in her; the\r\nIndians caught her at the last village and brought her up to us this\r\nevening for which service we gave them a couple of knives; the canoe\r\noverset and lost the articles which were in her.--Saw the white pine at\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 10, 1806]\r\nThursday April 10th 1806\r\nCollins went out in the bottom to hunt agreeable to the order of last\r\nevening, and gibsons Crew was derected to delay for Collins dureing\r\nwhich time they were derected to Collect rozin from the pines in the\r\nbottom near our Camp at 6 A M. we Set out and proceeded to the lower\r\npoint of the Island from whence we were Compelled to draw our Canoes up\r\na rapid for about 1/4 mile which we Soon performed. Collins & gibson\r\nhaveing not yet Come over we derected Serjt. Pryor to delay on the\r\nIsland untill Gibson Came over & assist him with the large toe roap\r\nwhich we also left and to join us at a village of four houses of the\r\nClah-lah-lar Tribe which is opposit to this Island on North Side at\r\nwhich place we intened to brackfast. in crossing the River which at\r\nthis place is not more than 400 yards wide we fell down a great\r\ndistance owing to the rapidity of the Current. I entered one of the\r\nhouses of those people and was Scercely Seated before they offered me a\r\nSheep Skin for Sale nothing could be more acceptable except the Animal\r\nitself in examoning this Skin I found it was a young one, the Skin of\r\nthe head was Cased So as to fit the head of a man and was esteemed as a\r\ngreat orniment and highly prised by them. we precured this Cased head\r\nfor a knife and, the Skin we were obliged to give two Raw Elk Skins\r\nfor. Soon after they offered a large one for Sall. after finding us\r\nanxious to purchase they declined silling this Skin. those people\r\ninformed us that they killed those Animals among the rocks in the\r\nmountains under which they live; and that great numbers of those\r\nanimals inhabit those mountains & that the lamb was killed out of a\r\ngange of 36 at a Short distance from their village. The wool of the\r\nfull grown Sheep, or that on the Skin which we Saw was much Corser than\r\nthat of the one which we purchased, the Skin was about the Size of that\r\nof a Common deer. The Skin we obtained appeared to be the Skin of a\r\nSheep not fully grown, the wool fine, the Horns were abought 4 inches\r\nlong, Celindric, Smooth, black, a little bending backwards and pointed;\r\nthey rise from the Middle of the foeheard, and a little above the eyes,\r\nand appeared to possess all the marks of the Common Sheep as already\r\ndiscribed. We could precure no provisions from those people except four\r\nwhite Salmon trout. at 10 oClock Sergt. Pryor and Gibson joined us with\r\nCollins who had killed 3 deer. these were all of the blacktailed fallow\r\nkind. We Set out and Continued up on the N. Side of the river with\r\ngreat dificuelty in Consequence of the Rapidity of the Current and the\r\nlarge rocks which forms this Shore; the South Side of the river is\r\nimpassable.\r\n\r\nAs we had but one Sufficent toe roap and were obliged to employ the\r\nCord in getting on our Canoes the greater part of the way we could only\r\ntake them one at a time which retarded our progress very much. by\r\nevening we arived at the portage on the N. Side where we landed and\r\nConveyed our baggage to the top of the hill about 200 paces distant\r\nwhere we found a Camp. we had the Canoes drawn on Shore and Secured.\r\nthe Small Canoe got loose from the hunters and went adrift with a tin\r\ncup & a tomahawk in her; the Indians Caught her at the last Village and\r\nbrought her up to us this evening for which we gave them two knives;\r\nthe Canoe overset and lost the articles which were in her.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 11, 1806]\r\nFriday April 11th 1806.\r\nAs the tents and skins which covered both our men and baggage were wet\r\nwith the rain which fell last evening, and as it continued still\r\nraining this morning we concluded to take our canoes first to the head\r\nof the rapids, hoping that by evening the rain would cease and afford\r\nus a fair afternoon to take our baggage over the portage. this portage\r\nis two thousand eight hundred yards along a narrow rough and slipery\r\nroad. the duty of getting the canoes above the rapid was by mutual\r\nconsent confided to my friend Capt. C. who took with him for that\r\npurpose all the party except Bratton who is yet so weak he is unable to\r\nwork, three others who were lamed by various accedents and one other to\r\ncook for the party. a few men were absolutely necessary at any rate to\r\nguard our baggage from the War-clel-lars who crouded about our camp in\r\nconsiderable numbers. these are the greates theives and scoundrels we\r\nhave met with. by the evening Capt. C. took 4 of our canoes above the\r\nrapids tho with much difficulty and labour. the canoes were much\r\ndamaged by being driven against the rocks in dispite of every\r\nprecaution which could be taken to prevent it. the men complained of\r\nbeing so much fatiegued in the evening that we posponed taking up our\r\n5th canoe untill tomorrow. these rapids are much worse than they were\r\nfall when we passed them, at that time there were only three difficult\r\npoints within seven miles, at present the whole distance is extreemly\r\ndifficult of ascent, and it would be impracticable to decend except by\r\nleting down the empty vessels by a cord and then even the wrisk would\r\nbe greater than in taking them up by the same means. the water appears\r\nto be upwards of 20 feet higher than when we decended the river. the\r\ndistance by way of the river between the points of the portage is 3\r\nMsmany of the natives crouded about the bank of the river where the men\r\nwere engaged in taking up the canoes; one of them had the insolence to\r\ncast stones down the bank at two of the men who happened to be a little\r\ndetatched from the party at the time. on the return of the party in the\r\nevening from the head of the rapids they met with many of the natives\r\non the road, who seemed but illy disposed; two of these fellows met\r\nwith John Sheilds who had delayed some time in purchasing a dog and was\r\na considerable distance behind the party on their return with Capt. C.\r\nthey attempted to take the dog from him and pushed him out of the road.\r\nhe had nothing to defend himself with except a large knife which he\r\ndrew with an intention of puting one or both of them to death before\r\nthey could get themselves in readiness to use their arrows, but\r\ndiscovering his design they declined the combat and instantly fled\r\nthrough the woods. three of this same tribe of villains the\r\nWah-clel-lars, stole my dog this evening, and took him towards their\r\nvillage; I was shortly afterwards informed of this transaction by an\r\nindian who spoke the Clatsop language, and sent three men in pursuit of\r\nthe theives with orders if they made the least resistence or difficulty\r\nin surrendering the dog to fire on them; they overtook these fellows or\r\nreather came within sight of them at the distance of about 2 miles; the\r\nindians discovering the party in pursuit of them left the dog and fled.\r\nthey also stole an ax from us, but scarcely had it in their possession\r\nbefore Thompson detected them and wrest it from them. we ordered the\r\ncentinel to keep them out of camp, and informed them by signs that if\r\nthey made any further attempts to steal our property or insulted our\r\nmen we should put them to instant death. a cheif of the Clah-clel-lah\r\ntribe informed us that there were two very bad men among the\r\nWah-clel-lahs who had been the principal actors in these seenes of\r\noutradge of which we complained, and that it was not the wish of the\r\nnation by any means to displease us. we told him that we hoped it might\r\nbe the case, but we should certainly be as good as our words if they\r\npresisted in their insolence. I am convinced that no other\r\nconsideration but our number at this moment protects us. The Cheif\r\nappeared mortified at the conduct of his people, and seemed friendly\r\ndisposed towards us. as he appeared to be a man of consideration and we\r\nhad reason to beleive much rispected by the neighbouring tribes we\r\nthought it well to bestoe a medal of small size upon him. he appeared\r\nmuch gratifyed with this mark of distinction, and some little attention\r\nwhich we shewed him. he had in his possession a very good pipe tomahawk\r\nwhich he informed us he had received as a present from a trader who\r\nvisited him last winter over land pointing to the N. W., whome he\r\ncalled Swippeton; he was pleased with the tommahawk of Capt. C. in\r\nconsequence of it's having a brass bowl and Capt. C. gratified him by\r\nan exchange. as a further proof of his being esteemed by this white\r\ntrader, he gave us a well baked saylor's bisquit which he also informed\r\nus he had received from Swippeton. from these evidences I have no doubt\r\nbut the traders who winter in some of the inlets to the N. of us visit\r\nthis part of the Columbia by land at certain seasons, most probably\r\nwhen they are confined to their winter harbour. and if so some of those\r\ninlets are probably at no great distance from this place, as there\r\nseems to be but little inducement to intice the trader hither from any\r\nconsiderable distance particularly as the difficulty in traveling on\r\nthe borders of this mountainous country must be great at that season as\r\nthe natives informed me their snows were frequently breast deep. I\r\nobserve snowshoes in all the lodges of the natives above the Columbean\r\nvally. I hope that the friendly interposition of this chief may prevent\r\nour being compelled to use some violence with these people; our men\r\nseem well disposed to kill a few of them. we keep ourselves perefectly\r\non our guard. This evening we send Drewyer and the two Feildses on a\r\nfew miles up the river to the entrance of Cruzatt's river to hunt\r\nuntill our arrival. The inhabitants of the Y-eh-huh Village on the\r\nNorth side immediately above the rapids have lately removed to the\r\nopposite side of the river, where it appears they usually take their\r\nsalmon. like their relations the Wah-Clel-lars they have taken their\r\nhouses with them. I observe that all the houses lately established have\r\ntheir floors on the surface of the earth, are smaller and of more\r\ntemperary structure than those which are sunk in the ground. I presume\r\nthe former are their spring and Summer dwellings and the latter those\r\nof the fall and winter. these houses are most generally built with\r\nboards and covered with bark. some of an inferior ore more temperary\r\ncast are built entirely of cedar bark, which is kept smooth and\r\nextended by inserting small splinters of wood through the bark\r\ncrosswise at the distance of 12 or 14 inches assunder. several families\r\ninhabit the same appartment. their women as well as those of the 3\r\nvillages next below us pierce the cartelage of the nose and insert\r\nvarious ornaments. they very seldom imprint any figures on their skins;\r\na few I observed had one or two longitudinal lines of dots on the front\r\nof the leg, reaching from the ankle upwards about midleg. most of their\r\nwomen braid their hair in two tresses as before mentioned. the men\r\nusually cew their hair in two parsels which like the braded tresses of\r\nthe female hang over each ear in front of the sholder, and gives an\r\nadditional width to the head and face so much admired by them. these\r\ncews are usually formed with throngs of dressed Otterskin crossing each\r\nother and not roled in our manner arrond the hair. in all other\r\nrispects I observe no difference in their dress habits manners &c. from\r\nthose in the Neighbourhood of the diamond Island. today we recognized a\r\nman of the Elute nation who reside at the long narrows of the Columbia,\r\nhe was on his return from a trading voyage to the Columbean valley with\r\n10 or 12 others of his nation. many other natives from the villages\r\nabove were employed in taking their roots &c over the portage on their\r\nreturn. I observed that the men equally with the women engage in the\r\nlabour of carrying. they all left their canoes below the rapids and\r\ntook others above which they had left as they decended. those which\r\nwere left below were taken down the river by the persons from whom they\r\nhad been hired or borrowed. the natives from above behaved themselves\r\nin a very orderly manner. The salmon have not yet made their\r\nappearance, tho the natives are not so much distressed for food as I\r\nwas induced to believe. I walked down today about 3/4 of a mile below\r\nour encampment to observe the manner in which these people inter their\r\ndead. I found eight sepulchers near the north bank of the river built\r\nin the following manner. four strong forks are first sunk several feet\r\nin the ground and rise about six feet high, froming a parrallelogram of\r\n8 by 10 feet. the intervals between these upright forks, on which four\r\npoles are laid, are filled up with broad erect boards with their lower\r\nends sunk in the ground and their upper ends confined to the horizontal\r\npoles. a flat roof is formed of several layers of boards; the floors of\r\nthese sepulchres are on a level with the surface of the earth. the\r\nhuman bodies are well rolled in dressed skins and lashed securely with\r\nchords and laid horizontaly on the back with the head to the west. in\r\nsome of these sepulchres they are laid on each other to the debth of\r\nthree or four bodies. in one of those sepulchres which was nearly\r\ndecayed I observed that the human bones filled it perfectly to the\r\nhight of about three feet. many articles appear to be sacreficed to the\r\ndead both within and without the sepulcres. among other articles, I\r\nobserved a brass teakettle, some scollep shells, parts of several robes\r\nof cloth and skins, with sticks for diging roots &c.--this appears to\r\nbe the burying ground of the Wahclellahs, Clahclellahs and Yehhuhs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 11, 1806]\r\nFriday April 11th 1806\r\nrained the greater part of the last night and continued to rain this\r\nmorning, as the Skins and the Covering of both the mend and loading\r\nwere wet we determined to take the Canoes over first in hopes that by\r\nthe evening the rain would Sease and afford us a fair afternoon to\r\nCarry our baggage over the portage which is 2 miles by land and a\r\nSlipery road. I therefore took all the men except three who had Sore\r\nfeet and two to cook, and who were with the baggage; and with great\r\ndificuelty and much fatigue we drew up 4 of our canoes above the Rapids\r\n3 miles in extent. the men became So fatigued that we deturmined to\r\npuspone takeing the 5th Canoe untill tomorrow. Those rapids are much\r\nworse than they were at the time we passed last fall at that time there\r\nwas only three bad places in the distance of 7 miles. at this time the\r\nwhole distance is a rapid and dificuelt of assent; and would be very\r\ndangerous at this Stage of the water (which is ____ feet higher than\r\nwhen we passed down) to decent in any kind of Craft. Great numbers of\r\nthe nativs visited us and viewed us from the banks as we passed on with\r\nthe Canoes, maney of those people were also about our baggage and on\r\nthe portage road. two of those fellows insulted John Shields who had\r\ndelayed in purchaseing a dog at the upper part of the rapids and was\r\nSome distance behind myself and the party on our return to camp. they\r\nattempted to take his dog and push him out of the road. he had nothing\r\nto defend himself except a large knife which he drew with a full\r\ndeturmination to put one of them to death before he had an oppertunity\r\nof dischargeing his arrow. the nativs obseveing his motion ran off. one\r\nother Indn. Stold an ax and was not in possession before he was\r\ndetected by Thompson and the ax taken from him. one other fellow\r\nattempted to Steal Capt. Lewis's dog, and had decoyed him nearly half a\r\nmile we were informed of it by a man who Spoke the Clatsop language and\r\nimediately Sent three men with their guns who over took the Indians,\r\nwho on their approach ran off and lift the dog--we informed the nativ's\r\nby Signs that if the indians insulted our men or Stold our property we\r\nShould Certainly put them to death a Chief of the Clah-clal-lahs Tribe\r\ninformed us that there was two very bad men who had been guilty of\r\nthose mischevious acts. that it was not the wish of their tribe that\r\nany thing should be done which might displese the white people. this\r\nChief had a large fine pipe tomahawk which he informed me he got from a\r\nTrader he called Swippeton. I exchanged tomahawks with this Chief, and\r\nas he appeared to be a man of consideration among the tribes of this\r\nneighbourhood and much conserned for the ingiries offered us, we gave\r\nhim a Medal of the Small Size which appeard. to please him verry much;\r\nand will I hope have a favourable tendincy, in as much as it will\r\nattach him to our interest, and he probably will harang his people in\r\nour favour, which may prevent any acts of violence being Commited, on\r\neither Side. nothing but the Strength of our party has prevented our\r\nbeing robed before this time. Sent Drewyer & 2 Fields on a head to\r\nhunt. The inhabitents of the Wyach-hich Tribe Village imediately above\r\nthose rapids on the N W. Side have latterly moved their village to the\r\nopposit Side of the river, where they take their Salmon; they are now\r\nin the act of removeing and not only take their furniture and effects\r\nbut also the bark and most of the boards which formed their houses.\r\nThose like the tribes below Sometimes Sink their houses in the earth,\r\nand at other times have their flowrs leavil with the Surface of the\r\nearth; they are Generally built of boards and Covered with bark. those\r\nwhich appear intended for temporary use are most generally built of the\r\nWhite Cedar bark. Most of those have a division in the houses near the\r\nenterance which is at the end, or in the event of it's being a double\r\nhouse is from the center of a narrow passage. Several families enhabit\r\none appartment. the women of those people as well as those in the 3\r\nvillages below pierce the cartilage of the nose in which they ware\r\nVarious orniments. in other respects they do not deffer from those of\r\nthe Dimond Island. tho most of the women brad their hair which hangs in\r\ntwo tresses, one hanging over each ear. The yound men of all those\r\ntribes ware their hair plated, in two plats anging over each Sholder,\r\nmaney of them also Cew their hair with otter Skin divided on the crown\r\nof the head and hanging over each ear. to day I recognised a man of the\r\nElute nation who reside at the Long narrows, he was on his return from\r\na tradeing voyage to the Columbian Vally with 10 or 12 of his tribe.\r\nmaney others from the villages above this were takeing their roots &c.\r\nover the portage to day on their return home.\r\n\r\nvegitation is rapidly progressing. Sarvis berry, Sackacommis and the\r\nlarge leafed ash is in blume. also fir N. ____ in bloom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 12, 1806]\r\nSaturday April 12th 1806.\r\nIt rained the greater part of last night and still continued to rain\r\nthis morning. I therefore determined to take up the remaining perogue\r\nthis morning for which purpose I took with me every man that could be\r\nof any service. a small distance above our camp there is one of the\r\nmost difficult parts of the rapid. at this place the current sets with\r\ngreat violence against a projecting rock. in hawling the perogue\r\narround this point the bow unfortunately took the current at too great\r\na distance from the rock, she turned her side to the stream and the\r\nutmost exertions of all the party were unable to resist the forse with\r\nwhich she was driven by the current, they were compelled to let loose\r\nthe cord and of course both perogue and cord went a drift with the\r\nstream. the loss of this perogue will I fear compell us to purchase one\r\nor more canoes of the indians at an extravegant price. after breakfast\r\nall hands were employed in taking our baggage over the portage. we\r\ncaused all the men who had short rifles to carry them, in order to be\r\nprepared for the natives should they make any attempts to rob or injure\r\nthem. I went up to the head of the rapids and left Capt. C. below.\r\nduring the day I obtained a vocabulary of the language of the\r\nWar-clel-lars &c. I found that their numbers were precisely those of\r\nthe Chinnooks but the other parts of their language essentially\r\ndifferent. by 5 P.M. we had brought up all our baggage and Capt. C.\r\njoined me from the lower camp with the Clahclellah cheif. there is an\r\nold village situated about halfway on the portage road the fraim of the\r\nhouses, which are remarkably large one 160 by 45 feet, remain almost\r\nentire. the covering of the houses appears to have been sunk in a pond\r\nback of the village. this the chief informed us was the residence\r\noccasionally of his tribe. these houses are fraimed in the usual manner\r\nbut consist of a double set as if oune house had been built within the\r\nother. the floors are on a level with the ground. the natives did not\r\ncroud about us in such numbers today as yesterday, and behaved\r\nthemselves much better; no doubt the precautions which they observed us\r\ntake had a good effect. I employed sergt. Pryor the greater part of the\r\nday in reparing and corking the perogue and canoes. it continued to\r\nrain by showers all day. about 20 of the Y-eh-huhs remained with me the\r\ngreater part of the day and departed in the evening. they conducted\r\nthemselves with much propryety and contemned the conduct of their\r\nrelations towards us. We purchased one sheepskin for which we gave the\r\nskin of an Elk and one of a deer. this animal was killed by the man who\r\nsold us the skin near this place; he informed us that they were\r\nabundant among the mountains and usually resorted the rocky parts. the\r\nbig horned animal is also an inhabitant of these mountains. I saw\r\nseveral robes of their skins among the natives.as the evening was rainy\r\ncold and far advanced and ourselves wet we determined to remain all\r\nnight. the mountains are high steep and rocky. the rock is principally\r\nblack. they are covered with fir of several speceis and the white\r\ncedar. near the river we find the Cottonwood, sweet willow, broad\r\nleafed ash, a species of maple, the purple haw, a small speceis of\r\ncherry; purple currant, goosberry, red willow, vining and white burry\r\nhoneysuckle, huckkle burry, sacacommis, two speceis of mountain holley,\r\n&common ash. for the three last days this inclusive we have made only 7\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 12, 1806]\r\nSaturday April 12th 1806.\r\nrained the greater part of the last night and this morning untile 10\r\nA.M. we employed all hands in attempting to take up the lost Canoe. in\r\nattempting to pass by a rock against which the Current run with emence\r\nforce, the bow unfortunately took the Current at too great a distance\r\nfrom the rock, She turned broad Side to the Stream, and the exertions\r\nof every man was not Sufficient to hold her. the men were Compelled to\r\nlet go the rope and both the Canoe and rope went with the Stream. the\r\nloss of this Canoe will I fear Compell us to purchase another at an\r\nextravigent price. after brackfast all hands who were employed in\r\nCarrying the baggage over the portage 11/2 miles which they performed\r\nby 4 P.M. the nativs did not visit us in Such Crouds to day as\r\nyesterday. we Caused all the men of the party who ha Short guns to\r\ncarry them on the portage for fear of Some attempt on the part of the\r\nnativs to rob the party. The rain Continued at intervales all day. in\r\nthe evening after everry thing was taken from the lower Camp I Set out\r\nmyself accompanied by the Cheif of the Clah-clal lars to the head of\r\nthe portage. as we passed the remains of an old Village about half way\r\nthe portage, this Cheif informed me that this old Village had been the\r\nresidence of his Tribe dureing the last Salmon Season. this village I\r\nmentiond in decending this river, but did not know the Tribes that had\r\ninhabited it that time. Capt. Lewis took a vocabulary of the languge of\r\nthose people whilst I had all the baggage taken across the portage & we\r\nformed a Camp at the place we had encamped on our way down.\r\n\r\nat my arival at the head of the portage found about 20 of the natives\r\nof the Wy ach hich tribe who reside above the rapids, with Capt Lewis.\r\nthose people appeared much better disposed towards us than either the\r\nClahclallah or Wahclellah and Condemn their Conduct much. Those tribes\r\nI believe to be all the Same Nation their Language habits manners dress\r\n&c. are presisely alike and differ but little from those below the\r\nGreat Narrows of this river. I observed a woman with a Sheep Skin robe\r\non which I purchased for one Elk and one deer Skin. the father of this\r\nwoman informed me that he had killed the animal off of which he had\r\ntaken this Skin on the mountains imediately above his village, and that\r\non those mountains great numbers of those animals were to be found in\r\nlarge flocks among the Steep rocks. I also purchased 2 pieces of\r\nChapellell and Some roots of those people. as the evening was rainey\r\nand ourselves and party wet we Concluded to delay untill the morning\r\nand dry our selves. The Indians left us about 6 P M and returned to\r\ntheir Village on the opposit Side. mountains are high on each Side and\r\nCovered with Snow for about 1/3 of the way down. the growth is\r\nprincipally fir and White Cedar. the bottoms and low Situations is\r\nCovered with a variety Such as Cotton, large leafed ash, Sweet willow a\r\nSpecies of beech, alder, white thorn, cherry of a Small Speces, Servis\r\nberry bushes, Huckleberries bushes, a Speces of Lorel &c. &c. I saw a\r\nturkey buzzard which is the 3rd which I have Seen west of the rocky\r\nmountains. the 1st was on the 7 inst. above quick Sand river. for the\r\nthree last days this inclusive we have made 7 miles only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 13, 1806]\r\nSunday April 13th 1806.\r\nThe loss of one of our perogues rendered it necessary to distribute her\r\ncrew and cargo among the 2 remaining perogues and 2 canoes, which being\r\ndone we loaded and set out 8 A.M. we passed the village immediately\r\nabove the rapids where only one house at present remains entire, the\r\nother 8 having been taken down and removed to the oposite side of the\r\nriver as before mentioned. we found the additional laiding which we had\r\nbeen compelled to put on board rendered our vessels extreemly\r\ninconvenient to mannage and in short reather unsafe in the event of\r\nhigh winds; I therefore left Capt. C. with the two perogues to proceede\r\nup the river on the N. side, and with the two canoes and some\r\nadditional hands passed over the river above the rapids to the Y-eh-huh\r\nvillage in order to purchase one or more canoes. I found the village\r\nconsisting of 11 houses crouded with inhabitants; it appeared to me\r\nthat they could have mustered about 60 fighting men then present. they\r\nappeared very friendly disposed, and I soon obtained two small canoes\r\nfrom them for which I gave two robes and four elkskins. I also\r\npurchased four paddles and three dogs from them with deerskins. the dog\r\nnow constitutes a considerable part of our subsistence and with most of\r\nthe party has become a favorite food; certain I am that it is a healthy\r\nstrong diet, and from habit it has become by no means disagreeable to\r\nme, I prefer it to lean venison or Elk, and is very far superior to the\r\nhorse in any state. after remaining about 2 hours at this Village I\r\ndeparted and continued my rout with the four canoes along the S. side\r\nof the river the wind being too high to pass over to the entrance of\r\nCruzatts river where I expected to have overtaken Capt. C. not seing\r\nthe perogues on the opposite side I ascended the river untill one\r\noclock or about 5 ms. above the entrance of Cruzat's river. being\r\nconvinced that the perogues were behind I halted and directed the men\r\nto dress the dogs and cook one of them for dinner; a little before we\r\nhad completed our meal Capt. C. arrived with the perogues and landed\r\nopposite to us. after dinner I passed the river to the perogues and\r\nfound that Capt. C. had halted for the evening and was himself hunting\r\nwith three of the party. the men in formed me that they had seen\r\nnothing of the hunters whom we had sent on the 11th ints. to the\r\nEntrance of Cruzatt's Riv. I directed Sergt. ordway to take the two\r\nsmall canoes for his mess and the loading which he had formerly carried\r\nin the perogue we lost yesterday, and to have them dryed this evening\r\nand payed with rozin. Capt. Clark returned in about an hour and being\r\nconvinced that the hunters were yet behind we dispatched Sergt. Pryor\r\nin surch of them with two men and an empty canoe to bring the meat they\r\nmay have killed. John Sheilds returned a little after six P.M. with two\r\ndeer which he had killed. these were also of the blacktailed fallow\r\ndeer; there appears to be no other speceis of deer in these mountains.\r\nCapt. C. informed me that the wind had detained him several hours a\r\nlittle above Cruzatt's river; that while detained here he sent out some\r\nmen to hunt; one of them wounded two deer but got neither of them. the\r\nwind having lulled in the evening and not seing anything of Drewyer and\r\nthe Feildses he had proceeded on to this place where he intended\r\nwaiting for me, and as he did not see my canoes when he landed had\r\ntaken a hunt with some of the men as before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 13, 1806]\r\nSunday April 13th 1806\r\nThe loss of one of our large Canoes rendered it necessary to divide the\r\nloading and men of that Canoe between the remaining four, which was\r\ndone and we loaded and Set out at 8 oClock A.M. passed the village\r\nimediately above the rapids, where only one house remains entire the\r\nother 8 haveing been taken down and moved to the opposit Side of the\r\nColumbia as already mentioned. the additional men and baggage in each\r\nCanoe renders them Crouded and unsafe. Capt. Lewis with 2 of the\r\nSmallest Canoes of Sergt. Pryor & gibson and Crossed above the Rapids\r\nto the Village on the S E Side with a view to purchase a Canoe of the\r\nnativs if possible. he took with him Some Cloth and a fiew Elk skins\r\nand Deer Skins. I with the two large Canoes proceeded on up the N. W.\r\nSide with the intention of gitting to the Encampment of our hunters who\r\nwas derected to hunt in the bottom above Crusats River, and there wait\r\nthe arival of Capt. Lewis. I proceeded on to the bottom in which I\r\nexpected to find the hunters but Could See nothing of them. the wind\r\nrose and raised the ways to Such a hight that I could not proceed any\r\nfurther. we landed and I sent out Shields and Colter to hunt; Shields\r\nShot two deer but Could get neither of them. I walkd. to Crusats river\r\nand up it 1/2 a mile on my return to the party found that the wind had\r\nlulled and as we Could See nothing of our hunters. I deturmined to\r\nproceed on to the next bottom where I thought it probable they had\r\nhalted at 1/2 passed 2 P M Set out and proceeded on to the bottom 6\r\nmiles and halted at the next bottom formed a Camp and Sent out all the\r\nhunters. I also walked out my self on the hills but saw nothing. on my\r\nreturn found Capt. Lewis at Camp with two canoes which he had purchased\r\nat the Y-ep-huh village for two robes and four elkskins. he also\r\npurchased 4 paddles and three Dogs from the nativs with deer Skins. the\r\ndogs now constitutes a considerable part of our Subsistance & with most\r\nof the party has become a favourable food. Certain I am that is a\r\nhelthy Strong diet, derected Serjt. ordway to take the 2 Small Canoes\r\npurchased by Capt. Lewis for his mess and the loading he had in his\r\nCanoe which we lost yesterday, and drawed up and paid with rozin.\r\n\r\nI was convinced that the hunters must have been up River Cruzatt.\r\ndespatched Sergt. Pryor with 2 men in a Canoe, with directions to\r\nassend Crusats River and if he found the hunters to assist them in with\r\nthe meat. Jo. Shields returned about Sunset with two deer which he had\r\nkilled, those were of the Black tail fallow Deer. there appears to be\r\nno other Species of Deer in those mountains. We proceeded on 12 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 14, 1806]\r\nMonday April 14th 1806.\r\nThis morning at seven oCk. we were joined by Sergt. Pryor and the three\r\nhunters they brought with them 4 deer which Drewyer had killed\r\nyesterday. we took breakfast and departed. at 9 A.M. the wind arrose\r\nand continued hard all day but not so violent as to prevent our\r\nproceeding. we kept close along the N. shore all day. the river from\r\nthe rapids as high as the commencement of the narrows is from 1/2 to\r\n3/4 of a mile in width, and possesses scarcely any current. the bed is\r\nprincipally rock except at the entrance of Labuish's river which heads\r\nin Mount hood and like the quicksand river brings down from thence vast\r\nbodies of sand. the mountains through which the river passes nearly to\r\nthe sepulchre rock, are high broken, rocky, partially covered with fir\r\nwhite cedar, and in many places exhibit very romantic seenes. some\r\nhandsome cascades are seen on either hand tumbling from the stupendious\r\nrocks of the mountains into the river. near the border of the river I\r\nobserved today the long leafed pine. this pine increases in quantity as\r\nyou ascend the river and about the sepulchre rock where the lower\r\ncountry commences it superceedes the fir altogether. throughout the\r\nwhole course of this river from the rapids as high as the\r\nChilluckkittequaws, we find the trunks of many large pine trees sanding\r\nerect as they grew at present in 30 feet water; they are much doated\r\nand none of them vegetating; at the lowest tide of the river many of\r\nthese trees are in ten feet water. certain it is that those large pine\r\ntrees never grew in that position, nor can I account for this\r\nphenomenon except it be that the passage of the river through the\r\nnarrow pass at the rapids has been obstructed by the rocks which have\r\nfallen from the hills into that channel within the last 20 years; the\r\nappearance of the hills at that place justify this opinion, they appear\r\nconstantly to be falling in, and the apparent state of the decayed\r\ntrees would seem to fix the era of their decline about the time\r\nmen-tioned. at 1 P.M. we arrived at a large village situated in a\r\nnarrow bottom on the N. side a little above the entrance of canoe\r\ncreek. their houses are reather detatched and extent for several miles.\r\nthey are about 20 in number. These people call themselves We-ock-sock,\r\nWil-lacum. they differ but litte in appeance dress &c. from those of\r\nthe rapids. Their men have some leging and mockersons among them. these\r\nare in the stile of Chopunnish. they have some good horses of which we\r\nsaw ten or a douzen. these are the fist horses we have met with since\r\nwe left this neighbourhood last fall, in short the country below this\r\nplace will not permit the uce of this valuable animal except in the\r\nColumbian vally and there the present inhabitants have no uce for them\r\nas they reside immediately on the river and the country is too thickly\r\ntimbered to admit them to run the game with horses if they had them. we\r\nhalted at this village and dined. purchased five dogs some roots,\r\nshappalell, filberds and dryed burries of the inhabitants. here I\r\nobserved several habitations entirely under grownd; they were sunk\r\nabout 8 feet deep and covered with strong timber and several feet of\r\nearth in a conic form. these habitations were evacuated at present.\r\nthey are about 16 feet in diameter, nearly circular, and are entered\r\nthrough a hole at the top which appears to answer the double purpose of\r\na chimney and a door. from this entrance you decend to the floor by a\r\nladder. the present habitations of these people were on the surface of\r\nthe ground and do not differ from those of the tribes of the rapids.\r\ntheir language is the same with that of the Chilluckkittequaws. these\r\npeople appeared very friendly. some of them informed us that they had\r\nlately returned from a war excurtion against the snake indians who\r\ninhabit the upper part of the Multnomah river to the S. E. of them.\r\nthey call them To-wannah'-hi'-ooks. that they had been fortunate in\r\ntheir expedition and had taken from their enimies most of the horses\r\nwhich we saw in their possession. after dinner we pursued our voyage;\r\nCapt. Clark walked on shore with Charbono. I ascended the river about\r\nsix miles at which place the river washed the base of high clifts on\r\nthe Lard. side, here we halted a few minutes and were joined by Capt.\r\nC. and Charbono and proceeded on to the entrance of a small run on N.\r\nside a little below a large village on the same side opposite the\r\nsepulchre rock. this village can raise about an hundred fighting men\r\nthey call themselves. they do not differ in any rispect from the\r\nvillage below. many of them visited our camp this evening and remained\r\nwith us untill we went to bed. they then left us and retired to their\r\nquarters.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 14, 1806]\r\nMonday April 14th 1806\r\nThis morning at 7 oClock we were joined by Sgt. Pryor and they three\r\nhunters they brought with them 4 deer which drewyer had killed\r\nyesterday. we took brackfast and departed at 9 A.M. the wind rose and\r\nContinued to blow hard all day but not so violent as to prevent our\r\nproceeding. we kept Close allong the N. Shore all day. the river from\r\nthe rapids to the Commencement of the narrows is from 1/2 to 3/4 of a\r\nMile in wedth, and possesses but little Current. the bead is rock\r\nexcept at the enterence of Labiech's river which heads in Mt. Hood and\r\nlike the quick Sand River brings down from thence Vast bodies of Sand\r\nthe Mountains through which the river passes nearly to Cataract River\r\nare high broken rocky, particularly Covered with fir and white Cedar,\r\nand in maney places very romantic scenes. Some handsom Cascades are\r\nSeen on either Side tumbling from the Stupendious rocks of the\r\nmountains into the river. I observe near the river the long leafed Pine\r\nwhich increas as we assend and Superseeds the fir altogether about the\r\nSepulchre rock. We find the trunks of maney large pine trees Standing\r\nerect as they grew, at present in 30 feet water; they are much doated\r\nand none of them vegitateing. at the lowest water of the river maney of\r\nthose trees are in 10 feet water. the Cause I have attempted to account\r\nfor as I decended. at 1 P M. we arrived at a large village Situated in\r\na narrow bottom on the N. Side a little above the enterance of Canoe\r\nCreek. their houses are reather detached, and extend for Several Miles.\r\nthey are about 20 in number. those people Call themselves Wil-la-cum.\r\nthey differ but little in appearance dress &c. from those of the\r\nrapids. their men have Some legins and mockersons among them. those are\r\nin the Stile of Chopunnish. they have Some good horss of which we Saw\r\n10 or 12 these are the first horses we have met with Since we left this\r\nneighbourhood last fall in Short the Country below this place will not\r\npermit the use of this valuable animal except in the Columbian vally,\r\nand there the present inhabitents have no use for them as they reside\r\nimediately on the river and the Country is too thickly timbd. We halted\r\nat this village Dined and purchased five dogs, Some roots Chappalell,\r\nPhilberds and dried berries of the inhabitents. here I observed Several\r\nhabitations under ground; they were Sunk about 8 feet deep and covered\r\nwith Strong timber and Several feet of earth in a conic form. those\r\nhabitations are avacuated at present. they are about 16 feet diamieter,\r\nnearly Circular, and are entered through a hole at top which appears to\r\nanswer the double purpose of a Chimney and a dore. from this enterance\r\nyou decend to the flore by a ladder. the present habitations of those\r\npeople were on the Surface of the ground and do not differ from those\r\nof the tribes about the Rapids. their language is the Same with the Che\r\nluck kit to quaws. these people appeared very friendly. Some of them\r\ninformed us that they had latterly returned from the War excurtion\r\nagainst the Snake Indians who inhabit the upper part of the Multnomah\r\nriver to the S. E. of them they Call them To wan nah hi ooks. that they\r\nhad been fortunate in the expidition and had taken from their enimies\r\nmost of the horses which we Saw in their possession. after dinner we\r\nproceeded on our voyage. I walked on Shore with Shabono on the N. Side\r\nthrough a handsom bottom. met Several parties of women and boys in\r\nSerch of herbs & roots to Subsist on maney of them had parcels of the\r\nStems of the Sunflower. I joined Capt Lewis and the party at 6 miles,\r\nat which place the river washed the bottom of high Clifts on the N.\r\nSide. Several Canoes over take us with families moveing up. we passed 3\r\nencampments and came too in the mouth of a Small Creek on the N. Side\r\nimediately below a village and opposit the Sepulchar rock. this village\r\nConsists of about 100 fighting men of Several tribes from the plains to\r\nthe North Collected here waiting for the Salmon. they do not differ in\r\nany respect from those below. many of them visited our Camp this\r\nevening and remaind. with us untill we went to bead. they then left us\r\nand returned to their quarters. made ____ miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 15, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 15th 1806\r\nWe delayed this morning untill after breakfast in order to purchase\r\nsome horses of the Indians; accordingly we exposed some articles in\r\nexchange for horses the natives were unwilling to barter, we therefore\r\nput up our merchandize and at 8 A.M. we set out. we halted a few\r\nminutes at the sepulchre rock, and examined the deposits of the ded at\r\nthat place. these were constructed in the same manner of those already\r\ndiscribed below the rapids. some of them were more than half filled\r\nwith dead bodies. there were thirteen sepulchres on this rock which\r\nstands near the center of the river and has a surface of about 2 acres\r\nabove highwater mark.--from hence we returned to the nothern shore and\r\ncontinued up it about four miles to another village of the same nation\r\nwith whom we remained last night. here we halted and informed the\r\nnatives of our wish to purchase horses; the produced us several for\r\nsale but would not take the articles which we had in exchange for them.\r\nthey wanted an instrumet which the Northwest traders call an eye-dag\r\nwhich we had not. we procured two dogs of them and departed. a little\r\nbelow the entrance of Cataract river we halted at another village of\r\nthe same people, at which we were equally unsuccessful) in the purchase\r\nof horses. we also halted at the two villages of the Chilluckkittequaws\r\na few miles above with no better success. at three in the evening we\r\narrived at the entrance of Quinnette creek which we ascended a short\r\ndistance and encamped at the place we have called rockfort camp. here\r\nwe were visited by some of the people from the villages at the great\r\nnarrows and falls. we informed them of our wish to purchase horses, &\r\nagreed to meet them on the opposite or North side of the river tomorrow\r\nfor the purpose of bartering with them. most of them returned to their\r\nvillages this evening three only remained with us all night. these\r\npeople are much better clad than any of the nations below; their men\r\nhave generally leging mockersons and large robes, many of them wear\r\nshirts of the same form those of the Chopunnish and Shoshonees highly\r\nornamented with the quills of the porcupine as are also their\r\nmockersons and legings. they conceal the parts of generation with the\r\nskin of a fox or some other small animal drawn underneath a girdle and\r\nhanging loosly in front of them like a narrow apron. the dress of their\r\nwomen differs very little from those about the rapids. both men and\r\nwomen cut their hair in the forehead which comes down as low as the\r\neyebrows, they have long earlocks cut square at the end. the other part\r\nof their hair is dressed in the same manner as those of the rapids.\r\nafter we landed and formed our camp this evening Drewyer and some\r\nothers took a hunt and killed a deer of the longtailed kind. it was a\r\nbuck and the young horns had shot fourth about 2 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 15, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 15th 1806\r\nWe delayed this morning untill after brackfast in order to purchase\r\nSome horses of the Indians; accordingly we exposed Some articles in\r\nexchange for horses the nativs were unwilling to exchange their horses,\r\nwe put up our merchindize and at 8 A M. Set out. we halted a fiew\r\nminits at the Sepulchar rock and examined the deposit of the dead at\r\nthat place. those were Constructed in the Same manner of those already\r\ndescribed below the rapids. Some of them were more than half filled\r\nwith dead bodies. there were 13 Sepulchers on this rock which Stands\r\nnear the Center of the river, and has a Cerface of about two acres\r\nabove the water.-. from hence we returned to the Northern Shore and\r\nContinued up it about 4 miles to a Village at the enterance of Cateract\r\nRiver, here we halted and informed the nativs of our wish to purchase\r\nhorses; the produced Several for Sale but would not take the articles\r\nwe had in exchange for them. they wanted an instriment which the Northw\r\nTraders call an eye dag which we had not. we precured two dogs and\r\ndeparted we also halted at the two villages of the Chil luck kitequaws\r\na fiew Ms. above with no better Sucksess. at 3 in the evening we\r\narivied at the enterance of Quinnett Creek which we assended a Short\r\ndistance and Encamped at the place we had Called rock fort Camp. here\r\nwe were visited by Some of the people from the Villages at the long\r\nNarrows & Falls. we informed them of our wish to purchase horses, and\r\nagreed to meet them on the opposit or north Side on tomorrow for the\r\npurpose of bartering with them. most of them returned to their village\r\nthis evening three only remained with us all night. those people are\r\nmuch better Clad than the nativs below. their men have generaly Legins\r\nmockersons & large robes. Maney of them were Shirts of the Same form of\r\nthose of the Chopunnish & Shoshonees highly ornamented with the quils\r\nof the purcupine, as are also their mockersons & Legins. they Conseal\r\nthe parts of generation with the Skins of the Fox or Some other Small\r\nanimal drawn under neath a girdle and hanging loosely in front of them\r\nlike a narrow apron. The dress of their women differ verry little from\r\nthose about the rapids. both men & women Cut their hair in the forehead\r\nwhich comes down as low as the Eyebrows, they have long ear locks Cut\r\nSquare at the end. The other parts of their hair is dressed in the Same\r\nManner as those of the rapids. after we landld and formed our Camp this\r\nevening Drewyer and some oths took a hunt and killed a Deer of the log\r\ntailed kind. it was a Buck and the young deer horns had Shot foth about\r\ntwo inches made ____ miles to day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 16, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 16th 1806.\r\nAbout 8 A.M. Capt. Clark passed the river with the two interpreters,\r\nthe indian woman and nine men in order to trade with the natives for\r\ntheir horses, for which purpose he took with him a good part of our\r\nstock of merchandize. I remained in camp; sent out the hunters very\r\nearly in the morning, and set Sergts. Gass and Pryor with some others\r\nat work to make a parsel of packsaddles. twelve horses will be\r\nsufficient to transport our baggage and some pounded fish which we\r\nintend taking with us as a reserved store for the rocky mountains. I\r\nwas visited today by several of the natives, and amused myself in\r\nmaking a collection of the esculent plants in the neighbourhood such as\r\nthe Indians use, a specemine of which I preserved. I also met with\r\nsundry other plants which were strangers to me which I also preserved,\r\namong others there is a currant which is now in blume and has yellow\r\nblossom something like the yellow currant of the Missouri but is a\r\ndifferent speceis. Reubin Feilds returned in the evening and brought\r\nwith him a large grey squrrel and two others of a kind I had never\r\nbefore seen. they are a size less than the grey squirrel common to the\r\nmiddle atlantic states and of a pided grey and yellowish brown colour,\r\nin form it resembles our grey squrrel precisely. I had them skined\r\nleaving the head feet and tail to them and placed in the sun to dry.\r\nJoseph Feilds brought me a black pheasant which he had killed; this I\r\nfound on examination to be the large black or dark brown pheasant I had\r\nmet with on the upper part of the Missouri. it is as large as a well\r\ngrown fowl the iris of the eye is of a dark yellowish brown, the puple\r\nblack, the legs are booted to the toes, the tail is composed of 18\r\nblack feathers tiped with bluish white, of which the two in the center\r\nare reather shorter than the others which are all of the same length.\r\nover the eye there is a stripe of a 1/4 of an inch in width uncovered\r\nwith feathers of a fine orrange yellow. the wide spaces void of\r\nfeathers on the side of the neck are also of the same colour. I had\r\nsome parts of this bird preserved. our present station is the last\r\npoint at which there is a single stick of timber on the river for a\r\ngreat distance and is the commencement of the open plains which extend\r\nnearly to the base of the rocky Mts. Labuish returned this evening\r\nhaving killed two deer I sent and had them brought in. this evening\r\nCapt. C. informed me by some of the men whom he sent over that that he\r\nhad obtained no horses as yet of the natives. that they promised to\r\ntrade with him provided he would remove to their vil-lage. to this he\r\nhad consented and should proceede to the Skillute village above the\r\nlong narrows as soon as the men returned whom he had sent to me for\r\nsome other articles. I dispatched the men on their return to capt. C.\r\nimmediately with these articles and he set out with his party\r\naccompanyed by the natives to their village where he remained all\r\nnight.--the natives who had spent the day with me seemed very well\r\ndisposed, they left me at 6 in the evening and returned to their\r\nrispective villages. the hunters informed me that they saw some\r\nAntelopes, & the tracks of several black bear, but no appearance of any\r\nElk. we were informed by the Indians that the river which falls in on\r\nthe S. side of the Columbia just above the Eneshur village heads in\r\nMount hood and dose not water the extensive country which we have\r\nheretofore calculated on. a great portion of that extensive tract of\r\ncountry to the S. and S. W. of the Columbia and it's S. E. branch, and\r\nbetween the same and the waters of Callifornia must be watered by the\r\nMultnomah river.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 16, 1806]\r\nApril 16th 1806\r\nCrossed the river and Sent Drewyer & Goodrich to the Skil lute village\r\nto envite the Indians to trade horses with us, also sent Frazer &\r\nShabono to the Che-luck-kit-ti-quar village for the same purpose a\r\nnumber of Indians came of both nations and delayed the greater part of\r\nthe day without tradeing a Single horse the Great Chief of the\r\nSkillutes also came with Drewyer. he was lame and Could not walk he\r\ntold me if I would go to his Town his people would trade with me. I Set\r\nout late and arrived at Sunset and informd. the natives that in the\r\nmorning I would trade with them. he gave me onions to eate which had\r\nbeen Sweated. Peter played the violin and the men danced. Saw abt. 100\r\nStacks of fish. maney nations visit this place for trade. the\r\ndiscription of the houses, their dress habits &c. Smoked &c. I saw\r\ngreat numbers of horses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 16, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 16th 1806\r\nabout 8 oClock this morning I passed the river with the two\r\ninterpreters, and nine men in order to trade with the nativs for their\r\nhorses, for which purpose I took with me a good part of our Stock of\r\nmerchindize. Capt L. Sent out the hunters and Set Several men at work\r\nmakeing pack Saddles. twelve horses will be Sufficient to trans port\r\nour baggage and Some pounded fish with our dried Elk. which we intend\r\ntakeing with us as a reserved Store for the Plains & rocky mountains. I\r\nformed a Camp on the N. Side and Sent Drewyer & Goodrich to the\r\nSkillute Village, and Shabono & Frazer down to the Chilluckkitequaw\r\nVillages with derections to inform the nativs that I had Crossed the\r\nriver for the purpose of purchaseing horses, and if they had horses to\r\nSell us to bring them to my Camp. Great numbers of Indians came from\r\nboth Villages and delayed the greater part of the day without tradeing\r\na Single horse. Drewyer returned with the principal Chief of the\r\nSkillutes who was lame and Could not walk. after his arival Some horses\r\nwere offered for Sale, but they asked nearly half the merchindize I had\r\nwith me for one horse. this price I could not think of giveing. the\r\nChief informed me if I would go to his town with him, his people would\r\nSell me horses. I therefore Concluded to accompany him to his Village 7\r\nmiles distant. we Set out and arrived at the Village at Sunset. after\r\nSome Serimony I entered the house of the Chief. I then informed them\r\nthat I would trade with them for their horses in the morning for which\r\nI would give for each horse the articles which I had offered yestered.\r\nThe Chief Set before me a large platter of Onions which had been\r\nSweeted. I gave a part of those onions to all my party and we all eate\r\nof them, in this State the root is very Sweet and the tops tender. the\r\nnativs requested the party to dance which they very readily consented\r\nand Peter Cruzat played on the Violin and the men danced Several dances\r\n& retired to rest in the houses of the 1st and Second Cheif.\r\n\r\nthis village is moved about 300 yards below the Spot it Stood last fall\r\nat the time we passed down. they were all above grown and built in the\r\nSame form of those below already discribed. We observed maney stacks of\r\nfish remaining untouched on either Side of the river. The Inhabitents\r\nof this Village ware the robe of deer Elk Goat &c. and most of the men\r\nware Legins and mockersons and Shirts highly ornimented with Porcupine\r\nquills & beeds. the women were the Truss most Commonly. tho Some of\r\nthem have long Shirts all of those articles they precure from other\r\nnations who visit them for the purpose of exchangeing those articles\r\nfor their pounded fish of which they prepare great quantities. This is\r\nthe Great Mart of all this Country. ten different tribes who reside on\r\nTaptate and Catteract River visit those people for the purpose of\r\npurchaseing their fish, and the Indians on the Columbia and Lewis's\r\nriver quite to the Chopunnish Nation Visit them for the purpose of\r\ntradeing horses buffalow robes for beeds, and Such articles as they\r\nhave not. The Skillutes precure the most of their Cloth knivs axes &\r\nbeeds from the Indians from the North of them who trade with white\r\npeople who come into the inlets to the North at no great distance from\r\nthe Tapteet. their horses of which I saw great numbers, they precure\r\nfrom the Indians who reside on the banks of the Columbia above, and\r\nwhat fiew they take from the To war ne hi ooks or Snake Indians. I\r\nsmoked with all the principal men of this nation in the house of their\r\ngreat Cheif and lay my Self down on a Mat to Sleep but was prevented by\r\nthe mice and vermin with which this house abounded and which was very\r\ntroublesom to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 17, 1806]\r\nThursday April 17th 1806.\r\nThis morning early I sent out the hunters, and set several additional\r\nhands about the packsaddles. I find that the sturgeon is not taken by\r\nany of the natives above the Columbean vally. the inhabitants of the\r\nrapids at this time take a few of the white salmon trout and\r\nconsiderable quantities of a small indifferent mullet on which they\r\nprincipally subsist. I have seen none except dryed fish of the last\r\nseason in the possession of the people above that place, they subsist\r\non roots principally with some dryed and pounded fish. the salmon not\r\nhaving made their appearance proves a serious inconvenience to us. but\r\nfew of the natives visited my camp today and those only remained a few\r\nhours. even at this place which is merely on the border of the plains\r\nof Columbia the climate seems to have changed the air feels dryer and\r\nmore pure. the earth is dry and seems as if there had been no rain for\r\na week or ten days. the plain is covered with a rich virdure of grass\r\nand herbs from four to nine inches high and exhibits a beautiful) seen\r\nparticularly pleasing after having been so long imprisoned in mountains\r\nand those almost impenetrably thick forrests of the seacoast. Joseph\r\nFeilds brought me today three eggs of the party coloured corvus, they\r\nare about the size and shape of those of the pigeon. they are bluish\r\nwhite much freckled with dark redish brown irregular spots, in short it\r\nis reather a mixture of those colours in which the redish brown\r\npredominates, particularly towards the larger end.--This evening\r\nWillard and Cruzatte returned from Capt. Clark and brought me a note in\r\nwhich Capt. C. informed me that he had sill been unsuccessful) having\r\nnot obtained a single horse as yet from the natives and the state of\r\nour stores are so low that I begin to fear we shall not be enabled to\r\nobtain as many horses at this place as will convey our baggage and\r\nunless we do obtain a sufficient number for that purpose we shall not\r\nhasten our progress as a part of our baggage must still be conveyed by\r\nwater. Capt. C. informed me that he should proceed as far as the\r\nEneshur village today and would return tomorrow and join me at the\r\nSkillute village to which place I mean to proceed with the party\r\ntomorrow. I dispatched Shannon with a note to Capt. Clark in which I\r\nrequested him to double the price we have heretofore offered for horses\r\nand if possible obtain as many as five, by this means we shall be\r\nenabled to proceed immediately with our small canoes and those horses\r\nto the villages in the neighbourhood of the mussel shell rapid where\r\nhorses are more abundant and cheaper; with the remainder of our\r\nmerchandize in addition to the canoes we can no doubt obtain as many\r\nhorses there as will answer our purposes. delay in the villages at the\r\nnarrows and falls will be expensive to us inasmuch as we will be\r\ncompelled to purchase both fuel and food of the indians, and might the\r\nbetter enable them to execute any hostile desighn should they meditate\r\nany against us.--all the hunters returned in the evening. Sheilds had\r\nkilled one deer which he brought with him. the packsaddles were\r\ncompleted this evening. I had some Elkskins put in the water today make\r\nharnes for the packhorses but shall not cut them untill I know the\r\nnumber we can obtain.--there is a species of hiasinth in these plains\r\nthe bulb of which the natives eat either boiled baked or dryed in the\r\nsun. this bulb is white, not entirely solid, and of a flat form; the\r\nbulb of the present year overlays, or crowns that of the last, and\r\nseems to be pressed close to it, the old bulb is withered much thiner\r\nequally wide with that of the present year and sends fourth from it's\r\nsides a number of small radicles.--this hiasinth is of a pale blue\r\ncolour and is a very pretty flower. I preserved a specemine of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 17, 1806]\r\nApril 17th 1806\r\nI rose early and took a position near to the village and exposed the\r\nartiles I had for Sale Great numbers of Indians Came from different\r\nderections, Some from below Some above and others across the Countrey\r\nfrom the Tapteet river See description of the Nations &c.--I obtained a\r\nSketch of the Columbia as also Clarks river. See sketch I made a bargin\r\nwith the Chief who has more horses than all the village besides for 2\r\nhorses. Soon after he Canseled his bargin, and we again bargined for 3\r\nhorses, they were brought forward, and only one fit for Service, the\r\nothers had Such intolerable backs as to render them entirely unfit for\r\nService. as I would not take the 3 he would not Sell the good one to\r\nme, and we were off the bargin. I then packed up and was about Setting\r\nout for the Falls when one Indian Sold me 2 horses and one other one\r\nhorse, and Some others Said they wished to trade which caused me to\r\nconclude to delay here one other night. Maney of the natives from above\r\nCome and Said they would trade, but asked a higher price than I thought\r\nI could give or reather more than this nation asked.--Great numbers of\r\nMen.--I hed to purchase 3 dogs for the men to eate & Some\r\nShap-per-lell. I Sent Crusat, Wiser, Willard and McNeal back to Capt\r\nLewis informing him of my ill Suck'sess, and adviseing him to proceed\r\non to this place as Soon as possible, and my intention of proceededing\r\non to the falls to purchase horses if possible Several Indians arived\r\nlate this evening. Capt. Lewis Sent me a note by Shannon informing me\r\nthat he would Set early on tomorrow morning early &c. &c. I sleped in\r\nhouse of the 2d Chief and they had not any thing except fish to eate\r\nand no wood for fire. those people have a number of buffalow robes.\r\nThey have great number of Skimming nets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 17, 1806]\r\nThursday 17th of April 1806\r\nI rose early after bad nights rest, and took my merchindize to a rock\r\nwhich afforded an elegable Situation for my purpose, and at a Short\r\ndistance from the houses, and divided the articles of merchindize into\r\nparsels of Such articles as I thought best Calculated to pleas the\r\nIndians, and in each parcel I put as many articles as we could afford\r\nto give, and thus exposed them to view, informing the Indians that each\r\nparcel was intended for a horse. they tanterlised me the greater part\r\nof the day, Saying that they had Sent out for their horses and would\r\ntrade as Soon as they Came. Several parcels of merchindize was laid by\r\nfor which they told me they would bring horses. I made a bargin with\r\nthe Chief for 2 horses, about an hour after he canseled the bargin and\r\nwe again bargained for 3 horses which were brought foward, only one of\r\nthe 3 could be possibly used the other two had Such intolerable backs\r\nas to render them entirely unfit for Service. I refused to take two of\r\nthem which displeased him and he refused to part with the 3rd. I then\r\npacked up the articles and was about Setting out for the Village above\r\nwhen a man Came and Sold me two horses, and another man Sold me one\r\nhorse, and Several others informed me that they would trade with me if\r\nI would Continue untill their horses could be drove up. this induced me\r\nto Continue at this Village another day. Maney of the nativs from\r\ndifferent villages on the Columbia above offered to trade, but asked\r\nSuch things as we had not and double as much of the articles which I\r\nhad as we could afford to give. this was a very unfavourable\r\ncircumstance as my dependance for precureing a Sufficiency of horses\r\nrested on the Suckcess above where I had reasons to believe there were\r\na greater abundance of those animals, and was in hopes of getting them\r\non better terms. I purchased 3 dogs for the party with me to eate and\r\nSome Chap-pa-lell for my Self. before precureing the 3 horses I\r\ndispatched Crusat, Willard & McNeal and Peter Wiser to Capt Lewis at\r\nthe Rock fort Camp with a note informing him of my ill Suckcess in\r\nprecureing horses, and advised him to proceed on to this place as Soon\r\nas possible. that I would in the mean time proceed on to the Enesher\r\nNation above the Great falls and try to purchase Some horses of that\r\npeople. Soon after I had dispatched this party the Chief of the\r\nEnesher's and 15 or 20 of his people visited me and appeared to be\r\nanxious to See the articles I offered for the horses. Several of them\r\nagreeed to let me have horses if I would add Sundery articles to those\r\nI offered which I agreeed to, and they lay'd those bundles by and\r\ninformed me they would deliver me the horses in the morning. I proposed\r\ngoing with them to their Town. the Chief informed me that their horses\r\nwere all in the plains with their womin gathering roots. they would\r\nSend out and bring the horses to this place tomorrow. this entiligence\r\nwas flattering, tho I doubted the Sincerity of those people who had\r\nSeveral times disapointed me in a Similar way. however I deturmined to\r\nContinue untill tomorrow. in the mean time industously employd. our\r\nSelves with the great multitude of indians of differant Nations about\r\nus trying to purchase horses. Shabono purchased a verry fine Mare for\r\nwhich he gave Hurmen, Elks Teeth, a belt and Some other articles of no\r\ngreat value. no other purchase was made in the Course of this day. in\r\nthe evening I recved a note from Capt L--by Shannon informing me that\r\nhe Should Set out early on tomorrow morning and Should proceed up to\r\nthe bason 2 miles below the Skillute Village. and adviseing me to give\r\ndouble the prices which we had first agreed on for each horse. I\r\nobserve at every house Scooping Nets with which they take the Salmon.\r\n\r\nI was envited into the house of the 2nd Chief where Concluded to Sleep.\r\nthis man was pore nothing to eat but dried fish, and no wood to burn.\r\naltho the night was Cold they Could not rase as much wood as would make\r\na fire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 18, 1806]\r\nFriday April 18th 1806.\r\nLate last evening we were visited by the principal cheif of\r\nChilluckkittaquaws and 12 of his nation they remained with us untill 9\r\nOC. when they all departed except the Cheif and two others who slept at\r\nmy feet. we loaded our vessels and set out after an early breakfast\r\nthis morning. we gave the indians a passage to the N. shore on which\r\nthey reside and pursued our rout to the foot of the first rapid at the\r\ndistance of 4 ms. here we found it necessary to unload the perogues and\r\ncanoes and make a portage of 70 paces over a rock; we then drew our\r\nvessels up by a cord and the assistance of setingpoles. from hence we\r\nproceeded to the bason below the long narrows 5 ms. further and landed\r\non the Lard. side at 1/2 after 3. the Cheif when he left me this\r\nmorning promised to bring some horses to barter with me at the bason.-\r\nthe long narrows are much more formidable than they were when we\r\ndecended them last fall there would be no possibility of passind either\r\nup or down them in any vessel.--after unloading the canoes and\r\narranging the camp I walked up to the Skillute Village and jouined\r\nCapt. he had procured four horses only for which a high price had been\r\ngiven, at least more than double that which we had formerly given for\r\nthose which we purchased from the Shoshonees and the first band of\r\nFlatheads. they have a great abundance of horses but will not dispose\r\nof them. we determined to make the portage to the head of the long\r\nnarrows with our baggage and five small canoes. the 2 perogues we could\r\ntake no further and therefore cut them up for fuel. in the evening\r\nCapt. C. and myself returned to the camp at the bason and left Drewyer\r\nand three others with the merchandize at the village, three parsels of\r\nwhich had been laid by at the request of individuals who promised to\r\ngive us horses for them in the morning.--I shot my airgun in the\r\npresents of the natives at the village which excited great astonishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 18, 1806]\r\nApril 18th 1806\r\nearly this morning I was awoke by a Indian from the nieghbourhood of\r\nour horses, he had he arived here yesterday & this morning found a\r\nSmall bag of powder and ball which had been left when we exposed our\r\ngoods yesterday and brought it to me. I had a fire made out and exposed\r\nthe articles &c. having increased the articles for each horse, and Sent\r\nout 2 men to hunt the horses bought yesterday. after Colecting them\r\nSent Shabono and Frazer with the 4 I had purchased down to Capt Lewis.\r\nand was tanterlised with the expectation of purchaseing more\r\nimediately. Great numbers of the Indians from the falls and both above\r\nand below. none of them appeared anxious to part with their horses but\r\ntold me that Several were Comeing from the plains about 1 or 2 P M. and\r\nlaid by 2 parcels of merchindize and told me that they had Sent for\r\ntheir horses. among other Tribes was those of the Skad-datts who\r\nbantered the Skillutes to play with them at a Singular Kind of game\r\nwhich was Soon Made up and 9 of aside Sat down they were Some time\r\nmaking up their bets of Beeds, brass thimbles or tubes robes &c. &c.\r\nwhen the bets were all made up the nine on each Side took opposides\r\nfaceing each other at the distance of about 12 feet. in front of each\r\nparty was placed a long pole on which they Struck with a Stick and\r\nSung. they made use of 2 Small pices of bone in this form and Size a\r\nbone was given to 2 men of the Same party who changed it from hand to\r\nhand with great dexterity one hand above the other looking down, and\r\nwhen he was ready for the opposit party to guess he Seperated his hands\r\nSwinging them around the breast looking at the opposit party who waved\r\ntheir hand to the Side the bone was in. if the opposit party guessed\r\nthe hand of each man the bone was given to them. if neither it was\r\nnothing. if they guessed one which they might single out if they\r\npleased they recived his bone, and lost on the other as they hapened to\r\nfail in guessing the also lose one if they fail guessing both The game\r\nis plaid at different numbers & each party has 5 sticks.

I payed but little attention\r\nto this bargain however Suffered the bundles to lye. I dressed the\r\nSores of the principal Chief gave Some Small things to his children and\r\npromised the Chief Some Medicine for to Cure his Sores. his wife who I\r\nfound to be a Sulky Bitch and was Somewhat efflicted with pains in her\r\nback. this I thought a good oppertunity to get her on my Side giveing\r\nhere Something for her back. I rubed a little Camphere on her temples\r\nand back, and applyed worm flannel to her back which She thought had\r\nnearly restored her to her former feelings. this I thought a favourable\r\ntime to trade with the Chief who had more horses than all the nation\r\nbesides. I accordingly made him an offer which he excepted and Sold me\r\ntwo horses. Great numbers of Indians from defferent derections visited\r\nme at this place to day, none of them appeared willing to part with\r\ntheir horses, but told me that Several were Comeing from the plains\r\nthis evening. among other Nations who visit this place for the purpose\r\nof trade is the Skad-datt's. those people bantered the Skillutes to\r\nplay at a Singular kind of game. in the Course of the day the Skillutes\r\nwon all their beeds Skins arrows &c. This game was Composed of 9 men on\r\na Side. they Set down opposit to each other at the distance of about 10\r\nfeet. in front of each party a long pole was placed on which they\r\nStruck with a Small Stick to the time of their Songs. after the bets\r\nwere made up which was nearly half an hour after they Set down, two\r\nround bones was producd about the Size of a mans little finger or\r\nSomething Smaller and 21/4 inches in length. which they held in their\r\nhand Changeing it from one hand to the other with great dexterity. 2\r\nmen on the Same Side performed this part, and when they had the bone in\r\nthe hand they wished, they looked at their advosarys Swinging arms\r\naround their Sholders for their advosary Guess which they pirformed by\r\nthe motion the hand either to the right or left. if the opposit party\r\nguessed the hand of both of the men who had the bone, the bones were\r\ngiven to them. if neither the bones was retained and nothing Counted.\r\nif they guessed one and not the other, one bone was dilivered up and\r\nthe party possessing the other bone Counted one. and one for every time\r\nthe advosary miss guessed untill they guessed the hand in which the\r\nbone was in-in this game each party has 5 Sticks. and one Side wins all\r\nthe Sticks, once twice or thrice as the game may be Set. I observed\r\nanother game which those people also play and is played by 2 persons\r\nwith 4 Sticks about the Size of a mans finger and about 7 inches in\r\nlength. two of those Sticks are black and the other 2 White and\r\nSomething larger than the black ones. those Sticks they place in\r\ndefferent positions which they perform under a kind of trencher made of\r\nbark round and about 14 inches diamieter. this is a very intricate game\r\nand I cannot Sufficiently understand to discribe it. the man who is in\r\npossession of the Sticks &c places them in defferent positions, and the\r\nopposit party tels the position of the black Sticks by a motion of\r\neither or both of his hands &c. this game is Counted in the Same way as\r\nthe one before mentioned. all their games are accompanied with Songs\r\nand time. at 3 P. M Sergt. Ordway & three men arived from Cap Lewis\r\nthey brought with them Several Elk Skins, two of my Coats and 4 robes\r\nof the party to add to the Stores I had with me for the purchase of\r\nhorses.

The Cheif who\r\nhad Visited Capt Lewis promised him that he would bring Some horses to\r\nthe bason and trade with him. but he was not as good as his word. Capt\r\nLewis gave a large Kittle for a horse which was offered to him at the\r\nbason this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 19, 1806]\r\nSaturday Aprl. 19th 1806.\r\nThis morning early we had our small canoes drawn out, and employed all\r\nhands in transporting our baggage on their backs and by means of the\r\nfour pack horses, over the portage. This labour we had accomplished by\r\n3 P.M. and established our camp a little above the present Skil-lute\r\nvillage which has been removed a few hundred yards lower down the river\r\nthan when we passed them last fall and like others below have the\r\nfloors of their summer dwellings on the surface of the earth instead of\r\nthose cellars in which they resided when we passed them. there was\r\ngreat joy with the natives last night in consequence of the arrival of\r\nthe salmon; one of those fish was caught; this was the harbinger of\r\ngood news to them. they informed us that these fish would arrive in\r\ngreat quantities in the course of about 5 days. this fish was dressed\r\nand being divided into small peices was given to each child in the\r\nvillage. this custom is founded in a supersticious opinon that it will\r\nhasten the arrival of the salmon. with much difficulty we obtained four\r\nother horses from the Indians today, we wer obliged to dispence with\r\ntwo of our kettles in order to acquire those. we have now only one\r\nsmall kettle to a mess of 8 men. in the evening Capt. Clark set out\r\nwith four men to the Enesher village at the grand falls in order to\r\nmake a further attempt to procure horses. these people are very\r\nfaithless in their contracts. they frequently receive the merchandize\r\nin exchange for their horses and after some hours insist on some\r\nadditional article being given them or revoke the exchange. they have\r\npilfered several small articles from us this evening.--I directed the\r\nhorses to be hubbled & suffered to graize at a little distance from our\r\ncamp under the immediate eye of the men who had them in charge. one of\r\nthe men Willard was negligent in his attention to his horse and\r\nsuffered it to ramble off; it was not to be found when I ordered the\r\nothers to be brought up and confined to the picquits. this in addition\r\nto the other difficulties under which I laboured was truly provoking. I\r\nrepremanded him more severely for this peice of negligence than had\r\nbeen usual with me. I had the remaining horses well secured by\r\npicquits; they were extreemly wrestless and it required the attention\r\nof the whole guard through the night to retain them notwithstanding\r\nthey were bubbled and picquted. they frequently throwed themselves by\r\nthe ropes by which they were confined. all except one were stone horse\r\nfor the people in this neighbourhood do not understand the art of\r\ngelding them, and this is a season at which they are most vicious. many\r\nof the natives remained about our camp all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 19, 1806]\r\nApril 19th 1806\r\nthis morning early Some rain had the Small Canoes hauled out to dry\r\nevery man Capable of Carrying a load Comencd the portage and by 5 P.

W. in exchange for pounded fish copper and beads.\r\nat present the principal village of the Eneshur is below the falls on\r\nthe N. side of the river. one other village is above the falls on the\r\nS. side and another a few miles above on the N. side. the first\r\nconsists of 19, the 2cd of 11, and the 3rd of 5 lodges. their houses\r\nlike those of the Skillutes have their floors on the surface of the\r\nground, but are formed of sticks and covered with mats and straw. they\r\nare large and contain usually several families each for fuel they use\r\nstraw, small willows and the southern wood. they use the silk grass in\r\nmanufacturing their fishing nets and bags, the bear grass and cedar\r\nbark are employed in forming a variety of articles. they are poor,\r\ndirty, proud, haughty, inhospitable, parsimonious and faithless in\r\nevery rispect, nothing but our numbers I beleive prevents their\r\nattempting to murder us at this moment.\r\n\r\nThis morning I was informed that the natives had pilfered six\r\ntommahawks and a knife from the party in the course of the last night.\r\nI spoke to the cheif on this subject. he appeared angry with his people\r\nand addressed them but the property was not restored. one horse which I\r\nhad purchased and paid for yesterday and which could not be found when\r\nI ordered the horses into close confinement yesterday I was now\r\ninformed had been gambled away by the rascal who had sold it to me and\r\nhad been taken away by a man of another nation. I therefore took the\r\ngoods back from this fellow. I purchased a gun from the cheif for which\r\nI gave him 2 Elkskins. in the course of the day I obtained two other\r\nindifferent horses for which I gave an extravigant price. I found that\r\nI should get no more horses and therefore resolved to proceed tomorrow\r\nmorning with those which I had and to convey the baggage in two small\r\ncanoes that the horses could not carry. for this purpose I had a load\r\nmade up for seven horses, the eighth Bratton was compelled to ride as\r\nhe was yet unable to walk. I barted my Elkskins old irons and 2 canoes\r\nfor beads. one of the canoes for which they would give us but little I\r\nhad cut up for fuel. These people have yet a large quantity of dryed\r\nfish on hand yet they will not let us have any but for an exorbitant\r\nprice. we purchased two dogs and some shappellel from them. I had the\r\nhorses graized untill evening and then picquited and bubbled within the\r\nlimits of our camp. I ordered the indians from our camp this evening\r\nand informed them that if I caught them attempting to perloin any\r\narticle from us I would beat them severely. they went off in reather a\r\nbad humour and I directed the party to examine their arms and be on\r\ntheir guard. they stole two spoons from us in the course of the day.\r\nThe Scaddals, Squan-nan-os, Shan-wah-purrs and Shallattas reside to the\r\nN.

I Showed the nativs\r\nwhat I had to give for their horses and attempted to purchase them.\r\nthey informed me that they would not Sell any horses to me, that their\r\nhorses were at a long ways off and they would not trade them. my offer\r\nwas a blue robe, Callico Shirt, a handkerchef, 5 parcels of paint a\r\nKnife, a wampom moon 4 braces of ribin, a pice of Brass and about 6\r\nbraces of yellow heeds; and to that amount for what I had I also\r\noffered my large blue blanket for one, my Coat Sword & Plume none of\r\nwhich Seem to entice those people to give horses if they had any. they\r\nSet in their huts which is of mats Supported on poles without fire. at\r\nnight when they wish a light they burn dry Straw & Some fiew Small dry\r\nwillows. they Speak defferent from those below, have but little to\r\neate. Some roots & Dryed fish is to be found in their houses. I am half\r\nfrozed at this inhospitable Village which is moved from its position\r\nabove the falls to one below and Contains 19 large houses, a village is\r\nalso established on the other Side imedeately above the falls. all the\r\nnatives who was established above the Falls for Some distance has\r\nremoved Those people are much better dressed than they were at the time\r\nwe went down the river. They have all new, Deer, Elk, Ibex Goat & wolf\r\nSkin robes, their Children also the large squirel Skin robes, maney of\r\nthem have Legins and mockersons, all of which they precure of the\r\nIndians at a distance in exchange for their pounded fish & Beeds, they\r\nalso purchase Silk grass, of which they make their nets & Sales for\r\ntakeing fish they also purchase Bear grass and maney other things for\r\ntheir fish. those people gave me roots and berries prepared in\r\ndifferent ways for which I gave some Small articles in return.-Great\r\nnumbers of Skiming knets on their houses. Those people are Pore and\r\nKind durty & indolt. They ware their hair loose flowing the men cut in\r\nthe foward which the Skilloots do not &c. &c.\r\n\r\nI could not precure a Single horse of those people, dureing this day at\r\nany price, they offered me 2 for 2 kittles of which we Could not spear.\r\nI used every artifice decent & even false Statements to enduce those\r\npore devils to Sell me horses. in the evening two different men offered\r\nto Sell me three horses which they informed me was a little distance\r\noff and they would bring them imediately. those two persons as I found\r\nwent imediately off up the river to their tribe without any intention\r\nto find or Sell their horses. a little before Sunset 3 men arived from\r\nSome distance above and informed me that they Came to See me. at Sunset\r\nfinding no probability of Capt Lewis arival, packed up the articles and\r\ntook them into the lodge in which I lay last night. Great numbers of\r\nthose people geathered around me to Smoke. I gave them 2 pipes and lay\r\ndown in the back part of the house with Sgt. P. & the men with our arms\r\nin a Situation as to be ready in case of any alarm. those pore people\r\nappear entirely harmless--I purchased a dog and Some wood with a little\r\npounded fish and Chappaless. made a fire on the rocks and Cooked the\r\ndogs on which the men breckfast & Dined. wind hard all day cold from N\r\nW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 20, 1806]\r\nSunday 20th April 1806\r\na very cold morning the western mountains Covered with Snow I Shewed\r\nthe Eneshers the articles I had to give for their horses. they without\r\nhezitation informed me that they would not Sell me any for the articles\r\nI had, if I would give them Kitties they would let me have horses, and\r\nnot without. that their horses were at a long ways off in the planes\r\nand they would not Send for them &c. my offer was a blue robe, a\r\nCalleco Shirt, a Silk handkerchief, 5 parcels of paint, a knife, a\r\nWampom moon, 8 yards of ribon, Several pieces of Brass, a mockerson awl\r\nand 6 braces of yellow beeds; and to that amount for each horse which\r\nis more than double what we gave either the Sohsohne or first flat\r\nheads we met with on Clarks river I also offered my large blue blanket,\r\nmy Coat Sword & plume none of which Seamed to entice those people to\r\nSell their horses. not with standing every exertion not a Single horse\r\nCould be precured of those people in the Course of the day. Those\r\npeople are much better Clad than they were last fall, their men have\r\ngenerally legins mockersons and large robes. maney of them ware Shirts\r\nof the Same form of those of the Chopunnish and Shoshone highly\r\nornimented with porcupine quills. the dress of their winen differs\r\nverry little from those above the great rapids. their Children have\r\nSmall robes of the Squirel Skins. those of the men & women are\r\nprincipally deer, Some elk, wolf, Ibix & buffalow which they precure\r\nfrom distant nations who purchase their Pounded fish in exchange for\r\nthose robes & Beeds. The principal village of the Enesher nation is\r\nimedeately below the falls on the N. Side. one other village of the\r\nSame nation above the falls on the opposit Side and one other a few\r\nmiles above on the North Side.--The Houses of those people like the\r\nSkillutes have the flores of their Summer dwelling on the Surface of\r\nthe earth in Sted of those Sellers in which they resided when we passed\r\nthem last fall. those houses are Covered with mats and Straw are large\r\nand Contain Several families each. I counted 19 at this Village & 11 on\r\nthe opposit Side. those people are pore durty haughty. they burn Straw\r\nand Small willows. have but little to eate and deer with what they\r\nhave. they precure the Silk grass of which they make their nets, the\r\nbear grass for makeing their mats and Several other necessary of the\r\nIndians of the following nations who trade with them as also the\r\nSkillutes for their pounded fish.

I sent several men in surch of the horse with\r\norders to return at 10 A.M. with or without the horse being determined\r\nto remain no longer with these villains. they stole another tomahawk\r\nfrom us this morning I surched many of them but could not find it. I\r\nordered all the spare poles, paddles and the ballance of our canoe put\r\non the fire as the morning was cold and also that not a particle should\r\nbe left for the benefit of the indians. I detected a fellow in stealing\r\nan iron socket of a canoe pole and gave him several severe blows and\r\nmad the men kick him out of camp. I now informed the indians that I\r\nwould shoot the first of them that attempted to steal an article from\r\nus. that we were not affraid to fight them, that I had it in my power\r\nat that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses, but it\r\nwas not my wish to treat them with severity provided they would let my\r\nproperty alone. that I would take their horses if I could find out the\r\npersons who had stolen the tommahawks, but that I had reather loose the\r\nproperty altogether than take the hose of an inosent person. the chiefs\r\nwere present hung their heads and said nothing. at 9 A.M. Windsor\r\nreturned with the lost horse, the others who were in surch of the horse\r\nsoon after returned also. the Indian who promised to accompany me as\r\nfar as the Chopunnish country produced me two horses one of which he\r\npolitely gave me the liberty of packing. we took breakfast and departed\r\na few minutes after 10 OClock. having nine horses loaded and one which\r\nBratton rode not being able as yet to march; the two canoes I had\r\ndispatched early this morning. at 1 P.M. I arrived at the Enesher\r\nVillage where I found Capt Clark and party; he had not purchased a\r\nsingle horse. he informed me that these people were quite as unfriendly\r\nas their neighbours the Skillutes, and that he had subsisted since he\r\nleft me on a couple of platters of pounded roots and fish which an old\r\nman had the politeness to offer him. his party fared much better on\r\ndogs which he purchased from those people. the man resided here from\r\nwhom I had purchased the horse which ran off from me yesterday. I had\r\ngiven him a large kettle and a knife in exchange for that horse which I\r\ninformed him should be taken from him unles he produced me the lost\r\nhorse or one of equal value in his stead, the latter he prefered and\r\nproduced me a very good horse which I very cheerfully received. we soon\r\nmade the portage with our canoes and baggage and halted about 1/2 a\r\nmile above the Village where we graized our horses and took dinner on\r\nsome dogs which we purchased of these people. after dinner we proceeded\r\non about four miles to a village of 9 mat lodges of the Enesher a\r\nlittle below the entrance of Clark's river and encamped; one of the\r\ncanoes joined us the other not observing us halt continued on. we\r\nobtained two dogs and a small quantity of fuel of these people for\r\nwhich we were obliged to give a higher price than usual. our guide\r\ncontinued with us, he appears to be an honest sincere fellow. he tells\r\nus that the indians a little above will treat us with much more\r\nhospitality than those we are now with. we purchased another horse this\r\nevening but his back is in such a horid state that we can put but\r\nlittle on him; we obtained him for a trifle, at least for articles\r\nwhich might be procured in the U States for 10 shillings Virga Cory.-\r\nwe took the precaution of piquting and spanseling our horses this\r\nevening near our camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 21, 1806]\r\nApril 21st 1806\r\na fair Cold morning.

Capt L.\r\ninformed the Indians that the next man who attempted to steal Should be\r\nShot and thretened them and informed them that he could kill them in a\r\nmoment and Set their town on fire if he pleased. but it was not his\r\ndesire to hurt them Severly if they would let the property of the party\r\nalone. the Chiefs hung their heads and Said nothing. he lost the horse\r\nthat was given for a large kittle, and a Chopunnish man lent a horse to\r\ncarry a load and accompanied the party--The man who we had reason to\r\nbelieve had Stolen the horse he had given for the Kittle we thretend a\r\nlittle and he produced a very good horse in the place of that one which\r\nwe Chearfully receved.\r\n\r\nafter dinner we proceeded on about 4 Miles to a Village of 9 Mat Lodges\r\nof the Enesher, a little below the enterance of To war nah hi ooks\r\nriver and encamped. one of the Canoes joined us, the other not haveing\r\nobserved us halt continued on.

States for 10/-virga.\r\nCurrency--we took the precaution of picqueting and Spancelling our\r\nhorses this evening near our Camp. the evening Cold and we Could afford\r\nonly one fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 22, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 22cd 1806.\r\nLast night two of our horses broke loos from the picquits and straggled\r\noff some little distance, the men who had charge of them fortunately\r\nrecovered them early. at 7 A.M. we set out having previously sent on\r\nour small Canoe with Colter and Potts. we had not arrived at the top of\r\na hill over which the road leads opposite the village before Charbono's\r\nhorse threw his load, and taking fright at the saddle and robe which\r\nstill adhered, ran at full speed down the hill, near the village he\r\ndisengaged himself from the saddle and robe, an indian hid the robe in\r\nhis lodge. I sent our guide and one man who was with me in the rear to\r\nassist Charbono in retaking his horse which having done they returned\r\nto the village on the track of the horse in surch of the lost articles\r\nthey found the saddle but could see nothing of the robe the indians\r\ndenyed having seen it; they then continued on the track of the horse to\r\nthe place from whence he had set out with the same success. being now\r\nconfident that the Indians had taken it I sent the Indian woman on to\r\nrequest Capt. C. to halt the party and send back some of the men to my\r\nassistance being determined either to make the indians deliver the robe\r\nor birn their houses. they have vexed me in such a manner by such\r\nrepeated acts of villany that I am quite disposed to treat them with\r\nevery severyty, their defenseless state pleads forgivness so far as\r\nrispects their lives. with this resolution I returned to their village\r\nwhich I had just reached as Labuish met me with the robe which he\r\ninformed me he found in an Indian lodg hid behind their baggage. I now\r\nreturned and joined Capt Clark who was waiting my arrival with the\r\nparty. the Indian woman had not reached Capt C. untill about the time I\r\narrived and he returned from a position on the top of a hill not far\r\nfrom where he had halted the party. from the top of this emmenense\r\nCapt. C. had an extensive view of the country. he observed the range of\r\nmountains in which Mount Hood stands to continue nearly south as far as\r\nthe eye could reach. he also observed the snow clad top of Mount\r\nJefferson which boar S. 10 W. Mount Hood from the same point boar S. 30\r\nW. the tops of the range of western mountains are covered with snow.\r\nCapt C. also discovered some timbered country in a Southern direction\r\nfrom him at no great distance. Clarks river which mouths immediately\r\nopposite this point of view forks at the distance of 18 or 20 miles\r\nfrom hence, the wright hand fork takes it rise in mount Hood, and the\r\nmain branch continues it's course to the S. E.\r\n\r\nwe now made the following regulations as to our future order of march\r\n(viz) that Capt. C. & myself should devide the men who were\r\ndisencumbered by horses and march alternately each day the one in front\r\nand the other in rear. haveing divided the party agreeably to this\r\narrangement, we proceeded on through an open plain country about 8\r\nmiles to a village of 6 houses of the Eneshur nation, here we observed\r\nour 2 canoes passing up on the opposite side; the wind being too high\r\nfor them to pass the river they continued on. we halted at a small run\r\njust above the village where we dined on some dogs which we purchased\r\nof the inhabitants and suffered our horses to graize about three hours.\r\nthere is no timber in this country we are obliged to purchase our fuel\r\nof the natives, who bling it from a great distance. while we halted for\r\ndinner we purch a horse. after dinner we proceeded on up the river\r\nabout 4 miles to a village of 7 mat lodges of the last mentioned\r\nnation. here our Chopunnish guide informed us that the next village was\r\nat a considerable distance and that we could not reach it tonight. the\r\npeople at this place offered to sell us wood and dogs, and we therefore\r\nthought it better to remain all night. a man blonging to the next\r\nvillage abovd proposed exchanging a horse for one of our canoes, just\r\nat this moment one of our canoes was passing. we hailed them and\r\nordered them to come over but the wind continued so high that they\r\ncould not join us untill after sunset and the Indian who wished to\r\nexchange his horse for the canoe had gone on. Charbonoe purchased a\r\nhorse this evening. we obtained 4 dogs and as much wood as answered our\r\npurposes on moderate terms. we can only afford ourselves one fire, and\r\nare obliged to lie without shelter, the nights are cold and days warm.-\r\nColter and Pots had passed on with their canoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 22, 1806]\r\nTuesday 22nd of April 1806\r\nlast night 2 of our horses broke loose and Strayed of at a Short\r\ndis-tance. at 7 oClock we loaded up and Set out, haveing previously\r\nSent off the Canoe with Colter and Potts we had not arived at the top\r\nof the hill which is 200 feet before Shabonos horse threw off his load\r\nand went with great Speed down the hill to the Village where he\r\ndisengaged himself of his Saddle & the robe which was under it, the\r\nIndians hid the robe and delayed Capt. Lewis and the rear party Some\r\ntime before they found the robe which was in a lodge hid behind their\r\nbaggage, and took possession of it. dureing the time the front of the\r\nparty was waiting for Cap Lewis, I assended a high hill from which I\r\ncould plainly See the range of Mountains which runs South from Mt. Hood\r\nas far as I could See. I also discovered the top of Mt. Jefferson which\r\nis Covered with Snow and is S to W. Mt. Hood is S. 30° W. the range of\r\nmountains are Covered with timber and also Mt Hood to a sertain bite.\r\nThe range of Mountains has Snow on them. I also discovered some\r\ntimbered land in a S. detection from me, Short of the mountains. Clarks\r\nriver which mouthes imedeately opposit to me forks at about 18 or 20\r\nmiles, the West fork runs to the Mt Hood and the main branch Runs from\r\nS. E. after Capt Lewis Came up we proceeded on through a open ruged\r\nplain about 8 miles to a Village of 6 Houses on the river. here we\r\nobserved our 2 Canoes passing up on the opposit Side and the Wind too\r\nhigh for them to join us. I halted at the mouth of a run above the\r\nvillage near Some good grass to let the horses graze and for the party\r\nto dine. Sent to the huts and purchased a dog & Some wood. dureing the\r\ntime the party was takeing diner we purchased one horse. after we\r\nproceeded on up the river about 4 miles to a village of 7 mat Lodges.\r\nhere our Chopunnish guide informed me that the next villg. was at Some\r\ndistance and that we Could not get to it to night, and that there was\r\nno wood to be precured on this Side. a man offered to Sell us a horse\r\nfor a Canoe. just at the moment we discovered one of our Canoes on the\r\nopposit Side. we concluded to Camp here all night with the expectation\r\nof precureing some horses. Sent and purchased Some wood and 4 dogs &\r\nShapillele. Shabono purchased a hors for which he gave a red rapper,\r\nShirt, ploom & Tomahawk &c. the party purchased a great quantity of\r\nChapellell and Some berries for which they gave bits of Tin and Small\r\npieces of Cloth & wire &c. had our horses led out and held to grass\r\nuntill dusk when they were all brought to Camp, and pickets drove in\r\nthe ground and the horses tied up. we find the horses very troublesom\r\nperticularly the Stud which Compose 10/13 of our number of horses. the\r\nair I find extreemly Cold which blows Continularly from Mt.

Serjt. Gass & R.

Reuben Feilds and\r\nSergt. Gass proceeded in the canoe. at 10 Labuish and Charbono returned\r\nunsuccessfull, they had gone back on the road nearly to the last\r\nvillage and suched the plains on either hand to a considerable\r\ndistance. our remaining longer would have prevented our making a timely\r\nstage which in our situation is all important; we therefore determined\r\nto proceed immediately to the next village which from the information\r\nof our guide will occupy the greater part of the day to reach at eleven\r\nOCk. we loaded our horses and set out. during the time we were detained\r\nthis morning we had two packsaddles made. we continued our march along\r\na narrow rocky bottom on the N. side of the river about 12 miles to the\r\nWah-how-pum Village of 12 temperary mat lodges near the Rock rapid.\r\nthese people appeared much pleased to see us, sold us 4 dogs and some\r\nwood for our small articles which we had previously prepared as our\r\nonly resource to obtain fuel and food through those plains. these\r\narticles conisted of pewter buttons, strips of tin iron and brass,\r\ntwisted wire &c. we also obtained some shap-pe-lell newly made from\r\nthese people. here we met with a Chopunnish man on his return up the\r\nriver with his family and about 13 head of horses most of them young\r\nand unbroken. he offered to hire us some of them to pack as far a his\r\nnation, but we prefer bying as by hireing his horses we shal have the\r\nwhole of his family most probably to mentain. at a little distance\r\nbelow this village we passed five lodges of the same people who like\r\nthose were waiting the arrival of the salmon. after we had arranged our\r\ncamp we caused all the old and brave men to set arround and smoke with\r\nus. we had the violin played and some of the men danced; after which\r\nthe natives entertained us with a dance after their method. this dance\r\ndiffered from any I have yet seen. they formed a circle and all sung as\r\nwell the spectators as the dancers who performed within the circle.\r\nthese placed their sholders together with their robes tightly drawn\r\nabout them and danced in a line from side to side, several parties of\r\nfrom 4 to seven will be performing within the circle at the same time.\r\nthe whole concluded with a premiscuous dance in which most of them sung\r\nand danced. these people speak a language very similar to the\r\nChopunnish whome they also resemble in their dress their women wear\r\nlong legings mockersons shirts and robes. their men also dress with\r\nlegings shirts robes and mockersons. after the dance was ended the\r\nIndians retired at our request and we retired to rest. we had all our\r\nhorses side bubbled and turned out to graize; at this village, a large\r\ncreek falls in on the N. side which we did not observe as we decended\r\nthe river. the river is by no means as rapid as when we decended or at\r\nleast not obstructed with those dangerous rapids the water at present\r\ncovers most of the rocks in the bed of the river. the natives promised\r\nto barter their horses with us in the morning we therefore entertained\r\na hope that we shall be enabled to proceede by land from hence with the\r\nwhole of our party and baggage. came 12 miles by land. the sands made\r\nthe march fatieguing.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 23, 1806]\r\nWednesday 23rd 1806\r\nat day light this morning we were informed that the two horses of our\r\ninterpreter Shabono were missing on enquirey we were informed that he\r\nhad neglected to tie up his horses as derected last evening. we\r\nimedeately dispatch him, R. Fields & Labiech in Serch of the horses,\r\none of them were found at no great distance. the other was not found.\r\nR. Fields retd. without finding the horse Set out with Sergt Gass in\r\nthe Small Canoe at about 8 A M. at 10 Shabono and Labiech returned also\r\nunsucksessfull they had went on the back trail nearly to the last\r\nVillage and took a circle around on the hills. as our Situation was\r\nSuch that we Could not detain for a horse, which would prevent our\r\nmakeing a timely Stage which is a great object with us in those open\r\nplains, we Concluded to give up the horse and proceed on to the next\r\nvillage which we were informed was at Some distance and would take us\r\nthe greater part of the day. at 11 A.M. we packed up and Set out and\r\nproceeded up on the N. Side of the Columbia on a high narrow bottom and\r\nrockey for 12 miles to the Wah-how-pum village near the rock rapid of\r\n12 temporary mat Lodges, those people appeared pleased to See us. they\r\nSold us 4 dogs Some Shapollell and wood for our Small articles Such as\r\nawls pieces of Tin and brass. we passed Several Lodges on the bank of\r\nthe river where they were fixed waiting for the Salmon. I over took a\r\nChoponish man whome I had Seen at the long, and who had found a bag of\r\nour powder and brought it to me at that place. this man had his family\r\non the ____ and about 3 head of horses which appeared young and\r\nunbroke. his spous as also that of the other gave me a Cake of\r\nChapellell and proceeded on with me to the Wah howpum Village and\r\nformed his Camp near us. we Caused all the old & brave men to Set\r\naround and Smoke with us. we Caused the fiddle to be played and Some of\r\nthe men danced. after them the nativs danced. they dance different from\r\nany Indians I have Seen. they dance with their Sholders together and\r\npass from Side to Side, defferent parties passing each other, from 2 to\r\n7. and 4 parties danceing at the Same time and Concluding the dance by\r\npassing promiscuisly throu & beetween each other. after which we Sent\r\nof the Indians and retired to bed. Those people Speak a language verry\r\nSimilal to the Chopunish and with a very inconsiderable difference.\r\ntheir dress and appearance is more like those of the Great falls of the\r\nColumbia. we had all our horses Side hobbled and let out to feed. at\r\nthis village a large Creek falls in on the N. Side which I had not\r\nobserved as I decended the river. the river is by no means as rapid as\r\nit was at the time we decended. The nativs promised to give is a horse\r\nfor one of our Canoes. and offer to Sell us another for a Scarlet robe\r\nwhich we have not at present. Shabono made a bargin with one of the\r\nIndian men going with us, for a horse for Which he gave his Shirt. and\r\ntwo of the leather Sutes of his wife.

I baithed my feet in cold water from which I experienced\r\nconsiderable releif. The curloos are abundant in these plains and are\r\nnow laying their eggs. saw the Kildee, the brown lizzard, and a Moonax\r\nwhich the natives had petted. the winds which set from Mount Hood or in\r\na westerly direction are much more cold than those from the opposite\r\nquarter. there are now no dews in these plains, and from the appearance\r\nof the earth there appears to have been no rain for several weeks.--we\r\nderected that the three horses which we purchased yesterday should be\r\nbubbled and confined to a picqut, and that the others should be\r\ndisposed of in the same manner they were last evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 24, 1806]\r\nThursday 24th April 1806\r\nrose early this morning and Sent out after the horses all of which were\r\nfound except McNeals which I hired an Indian to find and gave him a\r\nTomahawk had 4 pack Saddles made ready to pack the horses which we may\r\npurchase. we purchased 3 horses, and hired 3 others of the Chopunnish\r\nman who accompanies us with his family, and at 1 P.M.

C's swoard\r\nto barter for horses but were unsuccessfull these articles constitute\r\nat present our principal stock in trade. the Pish-quit-pahs insisted\r\nmuch on our remaining with them all night, but sudry reasons conspired\r\nto urge our noncomplyance with their wishes. we passed one house or\r\nreather lodge of the Metcowwees about a mile above our encampment of\r\nthe ____th of October last the Pish-quit-pahs, may be considered\r\nhunters as well as fishermen as they spend the fall and winter months\r\nin that occupation. they are generally pleasently featured of good\r\nstatue and well proportioned. both women and men ride extreemly well.\r\ntheir bridle is usually a hair rope tyed with both ends to the under\r\njaw of the horse, and their saddle consists of a pad of dressed skin\r\nstuffed with goats hair with wooden stirups. almost all the horses\r\nwhich I have seen in possession of the Indians have soar backs. the\r\nPishquitpah women for the most part dress with short shirts which reach\r\nto their knees long legings and mockersons, they also use large robes;\r\nsome of them weare only the truss and robe they brade their hair as\r\nbefore discribed but the heads of neither male nor female of this tribe\r\nare so much flattened as the nations lower down on this river. at 4\r\nP.M. we set out accompanyed by eighteen or twenty of their young men on\r\nhorseback. we continued our rout about nine miles where finding as many\r\nwillows as would answer our purposes for fuel we encamped for the\r\nevening. the country we passed through was much as that of yesterday.\r\nthe river hills are about 250 feet high and generally abrupt and\r\ncraggey in many places faced with a perpendicular and solid rock. this\r\nrock is black and hard. leve plains extend themselves from the tops of\r\nthe river hills to a great distance on either side of the river. the\r\nsoil is not as fertile as about the falls, tho it produces a low grass\r\non which the horses feed very conveniently. it astonished me to seed\r\nthe order of their horses at this season of the year when I knew that\r\nthey had wintered on the dry grass of the plains and at the same time\r\nroad with greater severity than is common among ourselves. I did not\r\nsee a single horse which could be deemed poor and many of them were as\r\nfat as seals. their horses are generally good. this evining after we\r\nhad encamped, we traded for two horses with nearly the same articles we\r\nhad offered at the village; these nags Capt.

C. signifying his wish to get a kettle\r\nbut on being informed that we had already disposed of every kettle we\r\ncould possibly spear he said he was content with whatever he thought\r\nproper to give him. Capt. C. gave him his swoard a hundred balls and\r\npowder and some sail articles with which he appeared perfectly\r\nsatisfyed. it was necessary before we entered on our rout through the\r\nplains where we were to meet with no lodges or resident indians that we\r\nshould lay in a stock of provision and not depend altogether on the\r\ngun. we directed Frazier to whom we have intrusted the duty of makeing\r\nthose purchases to lay in as many fat dogs as he could procure; he soon\r\nobtained ten. being anxious to depart we requested the Cheif to furnish\r\nus with canoes to pass the river, but he insisted on our remaining with\r\nhim this day at least, that he would be much pleased if we would conset\r\nto remain two or three, but he would not let us have canoes to leave\r\nhim today. that he had sent for the Chym nap'-pos his neighbours to\r\ncome down and join his people this evening and dance for us. we urged\r\nthe necessity of our going on immediately in order that we might the\r\nsooner return to them with the articles which they wished but this had\r\nno effect, he said that the time he asked could not make any\r\nconsiderable difference. I at length urged that there was no wind\r\nblowing and that the river was consequently in good order to pass our\r\nhorses and if he would furnish us with canoes for that purpose we would\r\nremain all night at our present encampment, to this proposition he\r\nassented and soon produced us a couple of canoes by means of which we\r\npassed our horses over the river safely and bubbled them as usual. we\r\nfound a Shoshone woman, prisoner among these people by means of whome\r\nand Sahcahgarweah we found the means of conversing with the\r\nWollahwollahs. we conversed with them for several hours and fully\r\nsatisfyed all their enquiries with rispect to ourselves and the objects\r\nof our pursuit. they were much pleased. they brought several diseased\r\npersons to us for whom they requested some medical aid. one had his\r\nknee contracted by the rheumatism, another with a broken arm &c to all\r\nof which we administered much to the gratification of those poor\r\nwretches. we gave them some eye-water which I beleive will render them\r\nmore essential service than any other article in the medical way which\r\nwe had it in our power to bestoe on them. soar eyes seem to be a\r\nuniversal complaint amonge these people; I have no doubt but the fine\r\nsand of these plains and river contribute much to this disorder. ulsers\r\nand irruptions of the skin on various parts of the body are also common\r\ndiseases among them. a little before sunset the Chymnahpos arrived;\r\nthey were about 100 men and a few women; they joined the Wallahwollahs\r\nwho were about the same number and formed a half circle arround our\r\ncamp where they waited very patiently to see our party dance. the\r\nfiddle was played and the men amused themselves with dancing about an\r\nhour. we then requested the Indians to dance which they very cheerfully\r\ncomplyed with; they continued their dance untill 10 at night. the whole\r\nassemblage of indians about 550 men women and children sung and danced\r\nat the same time. most of them stood in the same place and merely\r\njumped up to the time of their music. some of the men who were esteemed\r\nmost brave entered the space arrond which the main body were formed in\r\nsolid column, and danced in a circular manner sidewise. at 10 P.M. the\r\ndance concluded and the natives retired; they were much gratifyed with\r\nseeing some of our party join them in their dance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 28, 1806]\r\nMonday April 28th 1806\r\nThis morning early the Great Chief Yel lip pet brought a very eligant\r\nwhite horse to our Camp and presented him to me Signifying his wish to\r\nget a kittle but being informed that we had already disposed of every\r\nkittle we could possibly Spare he Said he was Content with what ever I\r\nthought proper to give him.

We urged the\r\nnecessity of our proceeding on imediately in order that we might the\r\nSooner return to them, with the articles which they wishd. brought to\r\nthem but this had no effect, he Said that the time he asked Could not\r\nmake any Considerable difference. I at length urged that there was no\r\nwind blowing and that the river was consequently in good order to pass\r\nour horses and if he would furnish us with Canoes for that purpose\r\n\r\nwe would remain all night at our present encampment, to this\r\nproposition he assented and Soon produced a Canoe. I Saw a man who had\r\nhis knee Contracted who had previously applyed to me for Some Medisene,\r\nthat if he would fournish another Canoe I would give him Some Medisene.\r\nhe readily Consented and went himself with his Canoe by means of which\r\nwe passed our horses over the river Safely and hobbled them as usial-.\r\nWe found a Sho Sho ne woman, prisoner among those people by means of\r\nwhome and Sah-cah gah-weah, Shabono's wife we found means of\r\nConverceing with the Wallahwallfirs. we Conversed with them for Several\r\nhours and fully Satisfy all their enquiries with respect to our Selves\r\nand the Object of our pursute. they were much pleased. they brought\r\nSeveral disordered persons to us for whome they requested Some Medical\r\naid. one had his knee contracted by the Rhumitism (whome is just\r\nmentioned above) another with a broken arm &c. to all of whome we\r\nadministered much to the gratification of those pore wretches, we gave\r\nthem Some eye water which I believe will render them more esential\r\nSirvece than any other article in the Medical way which we had it in\r\nour power to bestow on them Sore eyes Seam to be a universial Complaint\r\namong those people; I have no doubt but the fine Sands of those plains\r\nand the river Contribute much to the disorder. The man who had his arm\r\nbroken had it loosely bound in a peice of leather without any thing to\r\nSurport it. I dressed the arm which was broken Short above the wrist &\r\nSupported it with broad Sticks to keep it in place, put in a Sling and\r\nfurnished him with Some lint bandages &c. to Dress it in future. a\r\nlittle before Sun Set the Chim nah poms arrived; they were about 100\r\nmen and a fiew women; they joined the Wallah wallahs who were about 150\r\nmen and formed a half Circle arround our camp where they waited verry\r\npatiently to See our party dance. the fiddle was played and the men\r\namused themselves with danceing about an hour. we then requested the\r\nIndians to dance which they very Chearfully Complyed with; they\r\nContinued their dance untill 10 at night. the whole assemblage of\r\nIndians about 350 men women and Children Sung and danced at the Same\r\ntime. most of them danced in the Same place they Stood and mearly\r\njumped up to the time of their musick. Some of the men who were\r\nesteemed most brave entered the Space around which the main body were\r\nformed in Solid Column and danced in a Circular manner Side wise. at 10\r\nP M. the dance ended and the nativs retired; they were much gratified\r\nin Seeing Some of our Party join them in their dance. one of their\r\nparty who made himself the most Conspicious Charecter in the dance and\r\nSongs, we were told was a Medesene man & Could foretell things. that he\r\nhad told of our Comeing into their Country and was now about to Consult\r\nhis God the moon if what we Said was the truth &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 29, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 29th 1806.\r\nThis morning Yellept furnished us with two canoes and we began to\r\ntransport our baggage over the river; we also sent a party of the men\r\nover to collect the horses. we purchased some dogs and shappellell this\r\nmorning. we had now a store of 12 dogs for our voyage through the\r\nplains. by 11 A.M. we had passed the river with our party and baggage\r\nbut were detained several hours in consequence of not being able to\r\ncollect our horses. our guide now informed us that it was too late in\r\nthe evening to reach an eligible place to encamp; that we could not\r\nreach any water before night. we therefore thought it best to remain on\r\nthe Wallahwollah river about a mile from the Columbia untill the\r\nmorning, and accordingly encamped on that river near a fish wear. this\r\nwear consists of two curtains of small willow switches matted together\r\nwith four lines of withs of the same materials extening quite across\r\nthe river, parrallel with eah other and about 6 feet assunder. those\r\nare supported by several parsels of poles placed in the manner before\r\ndiscribed of the fishing wears. these curtains of willow are either\r\nroled at one end for a few feet to permit the fish to pass or are let\r\ndown at pleasure. they take their fish which at present are a mullet\r\nonly of from one to five lbs., with small seines of 15 or 18 feet long\r\ndrawn by two persons; these they drag down to the wear and raise the\r\nbottom of the seine against the willow curtain. they have also a small\r\nseine maniaged by one person it bags in the manner of the scooping net;\r\nthe one side of the net is confined to a simicircular bow of half the\r\nsize of a man's arm and about 5 feet long; the other side is confined\r\nto a strong string which being attatched to the extremities of the bow\r\nforms the cord line to the simicircle. The Wallahwollah river\r\ndischarges itself into the Columbia on it's S. side 15 miles below the\r\nentrance of Lewis's river or the S. E. branch. a high range of hills\r\npass the Columbia just below the entrance of this river. this is a\r\nhandsome stream about 41/2 feet deep and 50 yds. wide; it's bed is\r\ncomposed of gravel principally with some sand and mud; the banks are\r\nabrupt but not high, tho it dose not appear to overflow; the water is\r\nclear. the indians inform us that it has it's surces in the range of\r\nmountains in view of us to the E and S. E. these mountains commence a\r\nlittle to the south of Mt. Hood and extending themselves in a N.\r\nEastwardly direction terminate near a Southen branch of Lewis's river\r\nshort of the Rocky mountains. The Towannahiooks river, river LaPage and\r\nthe Wollah-wollah rivers all take their rise on the N side of these\r\nmountains; two principal branches of the first of these take their rise\r\nin Mountains Jefferson and hood. these mountains are covered with snow\r\nat present tho do not appear high; they seperate the waters of the\r\nMultnomah from those of the Columbia river. they appear to be about 65\r\nor 70 miles distant from hence. The Snake indian prisoner informed us\r\nthat at some distance in the large plains to the South of those\r\nmountains there was a large river runing to the N. W. which was as wide\r\nas the Columbia at this place which is nearly one mile. this account is\r\nno doubt some what exagerated but it serves to evince the certainty of\r\nthe Multnomah being a very large river and that it's waters are\r\nseperated from the Columbia by those mountains and that with the aid of\r\na southwardly branch of Lewis's river which passes arrond the eastern\r\nextremity of those mountains, it must water that vast tract of country\r\nextending from those mountains to the waters of the gulph of\r\nCalifornia. and no doubt it heads with the Yellowstone river and the\r\ndel Nord. we gave small medals to two inferior cheifs of this nation\r\nand they each presented us a fine horse in return we gave them sundry\r\narticles and among others one of my case pistols and several hundred\r\nrounds of amunition. there are 12 other lodges of the Wollahwollah\r\nnation on this river a little distance below our camp. 12 these as well\r\nas those beyond the Columbia appear to depend on this fishing wear for\r\ntheir subsistence. these people as well as the Chymnahpos are very well\r\ndressed, much more so particularly their women than they were as we\r\ndecended the river last fall most of them have long shirts and\r\nleggings, good robes and mockersons. their women wear the truss when\r\nthey cannot procure the shirt, but very few are seen with the former at\r\nthis moment. I presume the success of their winters hunt has produced\r\nthis change in their attire. they all cut their hair in their forehead\r\nand most of the men wear the two cews over each sholder in front of the\r\nbody; some have the addition of a few small plats formed of the\r\nearlocks and others tigh a small bundle of the docked foretop in front\r\nof the forehead. their ornaments are such as discribed of the nations\r\nbelow and are woarn in a similar manner. they insisted on our dancinq\r\nthis evening but it rained a little the wind blew hard and the weather\r\nwas cold, we therefore did not indulge them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 29, 1806]\r\nTuesday April 29th 1806\r\nThis Morning Yelleppit furnished us with 2 Canoes, and We began to\r\ntransport our baggage over the river; we also Sent a party of the men\r\nover to collect our horses. we purchased Some deer and chappellell this\r\nmorning. we had now a Store of 12 dogs for our voyage through the\r\nplains. by 11 A.M. we had passed the river with our party and baggage\r\nbut were detained Several hours in consequence of not being able to\r\nCollect our horses. our guide now informed us that it was too late in\r\nthe evening to reach an eligible place to encamp; that we Could not\r\nreach any water before night. we therefore thought it best to remain on\r\nthe Wallah wallah river about a mile from the Columbia untill the\r\nmorning, accordingly encampd on the river near a fish Wear. this weare\r\nConsists of two Curtains of Small willows wattled together with four\r\nlines of withes of the Same Materials extending quite across the river,\r\nparralal with each other and about 6 feet asunder. those are Supported\r\nby Several parrelals of poles placed in this manner those Curtains of\r\nwillows is either roled at one end for a fiew feet to permit the fish\r\nto pass or are let down at pleasure. they take their fish which at\r\npresent are a Mullet only of from one to 5 pounds Wt. with Small Seines\r\nof 15 or 18 feet long drawn by two persons; these they drag down to the\r\nWear and rase the bottom of the seine against the willow Curtain. they\r\nhave also a Small Seine managed by one person, it bags in the manner of\r\nthe Scooping Nets; the one Side of the Net is Confined to a\r\nSimicircular bow of half the Size of a mans arm and about 5 feet long,\r\nthe other Side is confined to a Strong String which being attatched to\r\nthe extremities of the bow forms the Cord line to the Simicurcle.

W. which was as wide as the\r\nColumbia at this place, which is nearly 1 mile. this account is no\r\ndoubt Somewhat exagurated but it Serves to evince the Certainty of the\r\nMultnomah being a very large River and that it's waters are Seperated\r\nfrom the Columbia by those Mountains, and that with the aid of a\r\nSouthwardly branch of Lewis's river which pass around the Eastern\r\nextremity of those mountains, it must water that vast tract of Country\r\nextending from those Mountains to the Waters of the Gulf of\r\nCallifornia. and no doubt it heads with the Rochejhone and Del Nord.\r\n\r\nWe gave Small Medals to two inferior Chiefs of this nation, and they\r\neach furnished us with a fine horse, in return we gave them Sundery\r\narticles among which was one of Capt Lewis's Pistols & Several hundred\r\nrounds of Amunition. there are 12 other Lodges of the Wallahwallah\r\nNation on this river a Short distance below our Camp. those as well as\r\nthose beyond the Columbia appear to depend on their fishing weres for\r\ntheir Subsistance. those people as well as the Chym na poms are very\r\nwell disposed, much more So particular their women than they were when\r\nwe decended the river last fall. Most of them have long Shirts and\r\nleggins, good robes and Mockersons. their women were the truss when\r\nthey Cannot precure the Shirt, but very fiew are Seen with the former\r\nat the present. I prosume the Suckcess of their Winters hunt has\r\nproduced this change in their attere. they all Cut their hair in the\r\nfore head, and most of the men ware the two Cews over each Sholder in\r\nfront of the body; Some have the addition of a fiew Small plats formed\r\nof the eare locks, and others tigh a Small bundle of the docked foretop\r\nin front of the fore head. their orniments are Such as discribed of the\r\nnativs below, and are worn in a Similar manner. they insisted on our\r\ndanceing this evening but it rained a little the wind blew hard and the\r\nweather was Cold, we therefore did not indulge them.--Several applyed\r\nto me to day for medical aides, one a broken arm another inward fever\r\nand Several with pains across their loins, and Sore eyes. I\r\nadministered as well as I could to all. in the evining a man brought\r\nhis wife and a horse both up to me. the horse he gave me as a present.\r\nand his wife who was verry unwell the effects of violent Coalds was\r\nplaced before me. I did not think her Case a bad one and gave Such\r\nmedesine as would keep her body open and raped her in flannel. left\r\nSome Simple Medesene to be taken. we also gave Some Eye water 1 G. of\r\nEla v V. & 2 grs. of Sacchm Stry. to an ounce of water and in that\r\nperpotion. Great No. of the nativs about us all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, April 30, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 30th 1806.\r\nThis morning we had some difficulty in collecting our horses\r\nnotwithstanding we had bubbled and picquited those we obtained of these\r\npeople. we purchased two other horses this morning and several dogs. we\r\nexchanged one of our most indifferent horses for a very good one with\r\nthe Chopunnish man who has his family with him. this man has a daughter\r\nnew arrived at the age of puberty, who being in a certain situation is\r\nnot permitted to ascociate with the family but sleeps at a distance\r\nfrom her father's camp and when traveling follows at some distance\r\nbehind. in this state I am informed that the female is not permitted to\r\neat, nor to touch any article of a culinary nature or manly occupation.\r\nat 10 A.M. we had collected all our horses except the white horse which\r\nYellept had given Capt. C. the whole of the men soon after returned\r\nwithout being able to find this horse. I lent my horse to Yellept to\r\nsurch Capt. C's about half an hour after he set out our Chopunnish man\r\nbrought up Capt. C's horse we now determined to leave one man to bring\r\non my horse when Yellept returned and to proceed on with the party\r\naccordingly we took leave of these friendly honest people the\r\nWollahwollahs and departed at 11 A.M. accompanyed by our guide and the\r\nChopunnish man and family. we continued our rout N. 30 E. 14 ms.\r\nthrough an open level sandy plain to a bold Creek 10 yds. wide. this\r\nstream is a branch of the Wallahwollah river into which it discharges\r\nitself about six miles above the junction of that river with the\r\nColumbia. it takes it's rise in the same range of mountains to the East\r\nof the sources of the main branch of the same. it appears to be\r\nnavigable for canoes; it is deep and has a bold current. there are many\r\nlarge banks of pure sand which appear to have been drifted up by the\r\nwind to the hight of 15 or 20 feet, lying in many parts of the plain\r\nthrough which we passed today. this plain as usual is covered with\r\narromatic shrubs hurbatious plants and a short grass. many of those\r\nplants produce those esculent roots which form a principal part of the\r\nsubsistence of the natives. among others there is one which produces a\r\nroot somewhat like the sweet pittaitoe.--we encamped at the place we\r\nintersepted the creek where we had the pleasure once more to find an\r\nabundance of good wood for the purpose of making ourselves comfortable\r\nfires, which has not been the case since we left rock fort camp.\r\nDrewyer killed a beaver and an otter; a pan of the former we reserved\r\nfor ourselves and gave the indians the ballance. these people will not\r\neat the dog but feast heartily on the otter which is vastly inferior in\r\nmy estimation, they sometimes also eat their horses, this indeed is\r\ncommon to all the indians who possess this annimal in the plains of\r\nColumbia; but it is only done when necessity compells them.--the narrow\r\nbottom of this creek is very fertile, tho the plains are poor and\r\nsandy. the hills of the creek are generally abrupt and rocky. there is\r\na good store of timber on this creek at least 20 fold more than on the\r\nColumbia river itself. it consists of Cottonwood, birch, the crimson\r\nhaw, redwillow, sweetwillow, chokecherry yellow currants, goosberry,\r\nwhiteberryed honeysuckle rose bushes, seven bark, and shoemate. I\r\nobserved the corngrass and rushes in some parts of the bottom. Reubin\r\nFeilds overtook us with my horse. our stock of horses has now encresed\r\nto 23 and most of them excellent young horses, but much the greater\r\nportion of them have soar backs. these indians are cruell\r\nhorse-masters; they ride hard, and their saddles are so illy\r\nconstructed that they cannot avoid wounding the backs of their horses;\r\nbut reguardless of this they ride them when the backs of those poor\r\nannimals are in a horrid condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, April 30, 1806]\r\nWednesday April 30th 1806.\r\nThis morning we had Some dificuelty in Collecting our horses\r\nnotwithstanding we had hobbled & Picqueted those we obtained of those\r\npeople. we purchased two other horses this morning and 4 dogs. we\r\nexchanged one of our most indeferent horses for a very good one with\r\nthe Choponnish man who has his family with him. this man has a doughter\r\nnow arived at the age of puberty who being in a certain Situation-is\r\nnot permited to acoiate with the family but Sleeps at a distance from\r\nher father's Camp, and when traveling follows at Some distance be-hind.\r\nin this State I am informed that the female is not permited to eat, nor\r\nto touch any article of a culinary nature or manly occupation. at 10\r\nA.M. we had Collected all our horses except the White horse which\r\nYelleppit the Great Chief had given me. the whole of the men haveing\r\nreturned without being able to find this hors. I informed the chief and\r\nhe mounted Capt Lewis's horse and went in Serch of the horse himself.\r\nabout half an hour after the Chopunnish man brought my horse. we\r\ndeturmined to proceed on with the party leaving one man to bring up\r\nCapt L.-s horse when Yelleppit Should return. We took leave of those\r\nhonest friendly people the Wallah wallahs and departed at 11 A.M.\r\naccompanied by our guide and the Chopunnish man and family. we\r\nContinued our rout N. 30° E. 14 ms. through an open leavel Sandy Plain to\r\na bold Creek 10 yards wide. this stream is a branch of the Wallahwallah\r\nriver, and takes it's rise in the same range of mountains to the East\r\nof the main branch. deep and has a bold Current. there are maney large\r\nbanks of pure Sand which appear to have been drifted up by the wind to\r\nthe hight of 20 or 30 feet, lying in maney parts of the plains through\r\nwhich we passed to day. This plain as usial is covered with arromatic\r\nShrubs, hurbatious plants and tufts of Short grass. Maney of those\r\nplants produce those esculent roots which forms a principal part of the\r\nSubsistance of the Nativs. among others there is one which produce a\r\nroot Somewhat like the Sweet potato. We encamped at the place we\r\nintersepted the Creek where we had the pleasure once more to find a\r\nSufficency of wood for the purpose of makeing ourselves comfortable\r\nfires, which has not been the Case Since we left Rock fort Camp below\r\nthe falls. Drewyer killed a beaver and an otter. the narrow bottoms of\r\nthis Creek is fertile. tho the plains are pore & Sandy. the hills of\r\nthe Creek are generaly abrupt and rocky. there is Some timber on this\r\nCreek. it consists of Cotton wood, birch, the Crimson haw, red willow,\r\nSweet willow, Choke Cherry, yellow Current, goose berry, white berried\r\nhoney suckle, rose bushes, Seven bark, Shoemate &c. &c. rushes in Some\r\nparts of the bottoms.\r\n\r\nR. Fields over took us with Capt Lewis's horse our Stock of horses have\r\nnow increased to 23 and most of them excellent young horses, but much\r\nthe greatest part of them have Sore backs. those Indians are cruel\r\nhorse masters; they ride hard and their Saddles illey constructed. &c.\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 1, 1806]\r\nThursday May 1st 1806.\r\nWe collected our horses tolerably early this morning took and set out a\r\nlittle after 7 A.M. we pursued the indian road which led us up the\r\ncreek about nine miles, here the Chopunnish man wo was in front with me\r\ninformed that an old unbeaten tract which he pointed out to the left\r\nwas our nearest rout. we halted the party and directed them to unload\r\nand let their horses graize untill our guide came up who was at some\r\ndistance behind. I wished to obtain good information of this newly\r\nrecommended tract before I could consent to leave the present road\r\nwhich seemed to lead us in the proper direction was level and furnished\r\nwith wood and water. when the guide arrived he seemed much displeased\r\nwith the other, he assured us that the rout up the creek was the\r\nnearest, and much the best, that if we took the other we would be\r\nobliged to remain here untill tomorrow morning, and then travel a whole\r\nday before we could reach water, and that there was no wood; the other\r\nagreed that this was the case. we therefore did not hesitate to pursue\r\nthe rout recommended by the guide. the creek, it's bottom lands, and\r\nthe appearance of the plains were much as those of esterday only with\r\nthis difference that the latter were not so sandy. we had sent out four\r\nhunters this morning two on foot and 2 on horseback they joined us\r\nwhile we halted here. Drewyer had killed a beaver. at 1 P.M. we resumed\r\nour march, leaving the Chopunnish man and his family; he had determined\r\nto remain at that place untill the next morning and then pursue the\r\nrout he had recommended to us. he requested a small quantity of powder\r\nand lead which we gave him. we traveled 17 miles this evening, making a\r\ntotal of 26 Ms. and encamped. the first 3 miles of our afternoons march\r\nwas through a similar country with that of the forenoon; the creek\r\nbottoms then became higher and widened to the extent of from 2 to 3 Ms.\r\nthe hills on the N. side were low but those on the opposite side\r\nretained their hight. we saw a number of deer of which Labuish killed\r\none. the timber on the creek becomes more abundant and it's extensive\r\nbottoms affords a pleasent looking country. the guide informs us that\r\nwe shall now find a plenty of wood water and game quite to the\r\nKooskooske. we saw a great number of the Curloos, some Grains, ducks,\r\nprarie larks and several speceis of sparrows common to the praries. I\r\nsee very little difference between the apparent face of the country\r\nhere and that of the plains of the Missouri only that these are not\r\nenlivened by the vast herds of buffaloe Elk &c which ornament the\r\nother. the courses and distances of this day are N. 45 E. 9 M. and N.\r\n75 E. 17 M. along the Northern side of this creek to our encampment.\r\nsome time after we had encamped three young men arrived from the\r\nWallahwollah village bringing with them a steel trap belonging to one\r\nof our party which had been neglegently left behind; this is an act of\r\nintegrity rarely witnessed among indians. during our stay with them\r\nthey several times found the knives of the men which had been\r\ncarelessly lossed by them and returned them. I think we can justly\r\naffirm to the honor of these people that they are the most hospitable,\r\nhonest, and sincere people that we have met with in our voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 1, 1806]\r\nThursday May 1st 1806.\r\nThis morning we collected our horses and made an early Start, haveing\r\npreveously Sent a hed 4 hunters with derections to proceed up the Creek\r\nand kill every Species of game which they might meet with. the Small\r\nportion of rain which fell last night Caused the road to be much furmer\r\nand better than yesterday. the morning Cloudy and Cool. we proceeded up\r\nthe Creek on the N. E. Side through a Countrey of less sand and Some\r\nrich bottoms on the Creek which is partially Supplyed with Small Cotton\r\ntrees, willow, red willow, choke Cherry, white thorn, birch, elder,\r\n____ rose & honey suckle. Great portion of these bottoms has been\r\nlatterly burnt which has entirely distroyed the timbered growth. at the\r\ndistance of nine miles we over took our hunters, they had killed one\r\nbever only at this place the road forked, one leaveing the Creek and\r\nthe Corse of it is nearly North. the Chopunnish who had accompanied us\r\nwith his family informed us that this was our best way. that it was a\r\nlong distance without water. and advised us to Camp on the Creek at\r\nthis place and in the morning to Set out early. This information\r\nperplexed us a little, in as much as the idea of going a days march\r\nwithout water thro an open Sandy plain and on a Course 50° out of our\r\nderection. we deturmined to unlode and wate for our Guide, or the\r\nChopunnish man who had accompanied us from the long Narrows, who was in\r\nthe rear with Drewyer our interpreter. on his arrival we enquired of\r\nhim which was the best and most direct roade for us to take. he\r\ninformed us that the road pointed out by his cumerade was through a\r\nopen hilly and Sandy Countrey to the river Lewis's River, and was a\r\nlong ways around, and that we Could not git to any water to day. the\r\nother roade up the creek was a more derect Course, plenty of water wood\r\nand only one hill in the whole distance and the road which he had\r\nalways recomended to us. Some words took place between those two men\r\nthe latter appeared in great pation Mounted his horse and Set out up\r\nthe Creek. we Sent a man after him and brought him back informed him\r\nthat we believed what he Said and Should imedeately after dinner\r\nproceed on the road up the Creek with him. we gave the former man Some\r\npowder and ball which had been promised him, and after an early dinner\r\nSet out up the Creek with our guide leaveing the Chopunnish man and his\r\nfamily encamped at the forks of the road where they intended to Stay\r\nuntill the morning and proceed on the rout he had recommended to us. we\r\ntraviled 17 miles this evening makeing a total of 26 mls. and encamped.\r\nthe first 3 miles of our afternoons march was through a Simaler Country\r\nof that of the fore noon; the Creek bottoms then became higher and\r\nwider; to the extent of from 2 to 3 miles. we Saw Several Deer of which\r\nLabiech killed one. the timber on the Creek become more abundant and\r\nless burnt, and its extensive bottoms afford a pleasent looking\r\nCountry. we Saw a Great number of Curloos, Some Crains, Ducks, prarie\r\ncocks, and Several Species of Sparrows common to the praries. I See\r\nVery little difference between the apparant face of the Country here\r\nand that of the plains of the Missouri. only that those are not\r\nenlivened by the vast herds of Buffalow, Elk &c. which animated those\r\nof the Missouri. The Courses & distances of this day are N. 45° E. 9 mls.\r\n& N. 75° E. 17 Miles allong the North Side of this Creek to our\r\nencampment. Sometime after we had encamped three young men arrived from\r\nthe Wallah wallah Village bringing with them a Steel trap belonging to\r\none of our party which had been negligently left behind; this is an act\r\nof integrity rearly witnessed among Indians. dureing our Stay with them\r\nthey Several times found the knives of the men which had been Carefully\r\nlossed by them and returned them. I think we can justly affirm to the\r\nhonor of those people that they are the most hospitable, honist and\r\nSencere people that we have met with on our Voyage.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 2, 1806]\r\nFriday May 2cd 1806.\r\nThis morning we dispatched two hunters a head. we had much difficulty\r\nin collecting our horses. at 8 A.M. we obtained them all except the\r\nhorse we obtained from the Chopunnish man whom we seperated from\r\nyesterday. we apprehended that this horse would make some attempts to\r\nrejoin the horses of this man and accordingly had him as we thought\r\nsecurely bubbled both before and at the side, but he broke the strings\r\nin the course of the night and absconded. we sent several men in\r\ndifferent directions in surch of him. I engaged one of the young\r\nindians who overtook us last evening to return in surch of him. at half\r\nafter 1 P.M.

Side N. 75° E 7 mes. the\r\ntimber increas in quantity the hills continue high. we met with the We\r\narh koont whome we have usially distinguished by the name of the big\r\nhorn Chief from the circumstance of his always wareing a horn of that\r\nanimal Suspended by a Cord to his left arm. he is a 1st Chief of a\r\nlarge band of the Chopunnish Nation. he had ten of his young men with\r\nhim. this man Went down Lewis's river by Land as we decended it by\r\nwater last fall quite to the Columbia, and I believe was very\r\ninstremental in precureing us a hospital and friendly reception among\r\nthe nativs. he had now come a Considerable distance to meet us. after\r\nmeeting this Cheif we Continued Still up the Creek bottoms N. 75° E. 2 m.\r\nto the place at which the roade leaves the Creek and assends the hill\r\nto the high plains: here we Encamped in a Small grove of Cotton trees\r\nwhich in some measure broke the violence of the wind. we Came 28 miles\r\ntoday. it rained, hailed, Snowed & blowed with Great Violence the\r\ngreater portion of the day. it was fortunate for us that this Storm was\r\nfrom the S. W. and of Course on our backs. the air was very cold. we\r\ndevided the last of our dried meat at dinner when it was Consumed as\r\nwell as the ballance of our Dogs nearly we made but a Scant Supper, and\r\nhad not any thing for tomorrow; however We-ark-koomt Consoled us with\r\nthe information that there was an Indian Lodge on the river at no great\r\ndistance where we might Supply our Selves with provisions tomorrow. our\r\nGuide and the three young Wallah wallah's left us this morning reather\r\nabruptly and we have Seen nothing of them Sence. the S W. Mountains\r\nappear to become lower as they receed to the N, E. This Creek reaches\r\nthe mountains. we are much nearer to them than we were last evening.\r\nthey are Covered with timber and at this time Snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 4, 1806]\r\nSunday May 4th 1806.\r\nCollected our horses and set out early; the morning was cold and\r\ndisagreeable. we ascended the Lard. hills of the creek and steered N. 60°\r\nE. 4 miles through a high level plain to a ravine which forms the\r\nsource of a small creek, thence down this creek N. 75° E. 8 ms. to it's\r\nentrance into Lewis's river 71/2 ms. below the entrance of the\r\nKooskooske. on the river a little above this creek we arrived at a\r\nlodge of 6 families of which Weark-koomt had spoken. we halted here for\r\nbreakfast and with much difficulty purchase 2 lean dogs. the\r\ninhabitants were miserably poor. we obtained a few large cakes of half\r\ncured bread made of a root which resembles the sweet potatoe, with\r\nthese we made some scope and took breakfast. the lands through which we\r\npassed today are fertile consisting of a dark rich loam the hills of\r\nthe river are high and approach it nearly on both sides. no timber in\r\nthe plains. the S. W. Mountains which appear to be about 15 Ms. above\r\nus still continue to become lower they are covered with snow at present\r\nnearly to their bases. Lewis's river appeas to pass through these mots.\r\nnear their N. Eastern extremity. these hills terminate in a high level\r\nplain between the Kooskooske and Lewis's river. these plains are in\r\nmany places well covered with the Longleafed pine, with some Larch and\r\nbalsom fir. the soil is extreemly fertile no dose it appear so thisty\r\nas that of the same apparent texture of the open plains. it produces\r\ngreat quantities of the quawmash a root of which the natives are\r\nextreemly fond. a great portion of the Chopunnish we are informed are\r\nnow distributed in small vilages through this plain collecting the\r\nquawmash and cows; the salmon not yet having arrived to call them to\r\nthe river. the hills of the creek which we decended this morning are\r\nhigh and in most parts rocky and abrupt. one of our pack horses sliped\r\nfrom one of those hights and fell into the creek with it's load\r\nconsisting principally of ammunition but fortunately neith the horse\r\nnor load suffered any material injury. the amunition being secured in\r\ncanesters the water did not effect it.--after dinner we continued our\r\nrout up the West side of the river 3 Ms. opposite to 2 lodges the one\r\ncontaining 3 and the other 2 families of the Chopunnish nation; here we\r\nmet with Te-toh, ar sky, the youngest of the two cheifs who accompanied\r\nus last fall the great falls of the Columbia here we also met with our\r\npilot who decended the river with us as far as the Columbia. these\r\nindians recommended our passing the river at this place and ascending\r\nthe Kooskooske on the N. E. side. they said it was nearer and a better\r\nrout to the forkes of that river where the twisted hair resided in\r\nwhose charge we had left our horses; thither they promised to conduct\r\nus. we determined to take the advice of the indians and immediately\r\nprepared to pass the river which with the assistance of three indian\r\ncanoes we effected in the course of the evening, purchased a little\r\nwood and some bread of cows from the natives and encamped having\r\ntraveled 15 Ms. only today. We-ark-koomt whose people resided on the\r\nWest side of Lewis's river above left us when we determined to pass the\r\nriver and went on to his lodg. the evening was cold and disagreeable,\r\nand the natives crouded about our fire in great numbers insomuch that\r\nwe could scarcely cook of keep ourselves warm. at all these lodges of\r\nthe Chopunnish I observe an appendage of a small lodg with one fire\r\nwhich seems to be the retreat of their women in a certain situation.\r\nthe men are not permitted to approach this lodge within a certain\r\ndistance and if they have any thing to convey to the occupants of this\r\nlittle hospital they stand at the distance of 50 or 60 paces and throw\r\nit towards them as far as they can and retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 4, 1806]\r\nSunday May 4th 1806\r\nCollected our horses and Set out early; the morning was Cold and\r\ndisagreeable. we assended the Larboard Hill of the Creek and Steared N\r\n60° E 4 M. through a high leavil plain to a revine which forms the Source\r\nof a small creek, thence down the Creek N 75° E. 8 Ms. to it's enterance\r\ninto Lewis's river 71/2 ms. below the enterance of Koos koos ke. on the\r\nriver a little above this Creek we arived at a lodge of 6 families of\r\nwhich We-ark'-koomt had Spoken. We halted here for brackfast and with\r\nmuch dificuelty purchased 2 lean dogs. the inhabitents were miserably\r\npore. we obtained a fiew large cakes of half cured bread made of a root\r\nwhich resembles the Sweet potatoe, with these we made Some Soope and\r\ntook brackfast. the lands through which we passed to day are fertile\r\nconsisting of a dark rich loam. the hills of the river are high and\r\nabrupt approaching it nearly on both Sides. no timber in the plains.\r\nthe S. W. Mountains which appear to be about 15 Miles from us Still\r\nContinue to become lower, they are Covered with Snow at present nearly\r\nto their bases. Lewis's river appear to pass through those Mountains\r\nnear the N Eastern extremity. those hills termonate in a high leavil\r\nplain between the Kooskoske & Lewis's river. these plains are in maney\r\nplaces well covered with the long leafed pine and Some balsom fir. the\r\nSoil is extreamly fertile. no does it appear So thirsty as that of the\r\nSame apparrant texture of the open plains. it produces great quantities\r\nof the quawmash a root of which the nativs are extreemly fond. a Great\r\nportion of the Chopunnish we are informed are now distributed in Small\r\nvillages through this plain Collecting the Cowse a white Meley root\r\nwhich is very fine in Soup after being dried and pounded; the Salmon\r\nnot yet haveing arived to Call them to the river-. The hills of the\r\nCreek which we decended this morning are high and in most parts rocky\r\nand abrupt. one of our pack horses Sliped from one of those hights and\r\nfell into the Creek with it's load Consisting principally of amunition,\r\nbut fortunately neither the horse nor load Suffered any Matereal\r\ninjury. the ammunition being Secured in Canesters the water did not\r\neffect it.\r\n\r\nafter dinner we Continued our rout up the West Side of the river 3 ms.\r\nopposit 2 Lodges the one Containing 3 and the other 2 families of the\r\nChopunnish Nation; here we met with Te-toh-ar-sky the oldest of the two\r\nChiefs who accompanied us last fall to the Great falls of the Columbia.\r\nhere we also met with our old pilot who decended the river with us as\r\nlow as the Columbia these indians recommended our passing the river at\r\nthis place and going up on the N E Side of the Kooskoske. they Sayed it\r\nwas nearer and a better rout to the forks of that river where the\r\ntwisted hair resided in whose charge we had left our horses; thither\r\nthey promised to Conduct us. we determined to take the advise of the\r\nindians and imediately prepared to pass the river which with the\r\nassistance of three indian Canoes we effected in the Course of the\r\nevening, purchased a little Wood, Some Cows bread and encamped, haveing\r\ntraveled 15 miles to day only. We ark koomt whose people reside on the\r\nWest Side of Lewis's river above left us when we deturmined to pass the\r\nriver. before he left us he expressed his concern that his people would\r\nbe deprived of the pleasure of Seeing us at the forks at which place\r\nthey had assimbled to Shew us Sivilities &c. I gave him a Small piece\r\nof tobacco and he went off Satisfied. the evening was Cold and\r\ndisagreeable, and the nativs Crouded about our fire in great numbers in\r\nso much that we Could Scercely Cook or keep ourselves worm. at all\r\nthose Lodges of the Chopunnish I observe an appendage of a Small lodge\r\nwith one fire, which Seames to be the retreat of their women in a\r\ncertain Situation. the men are not permited to approach this Lodge\r\nwithin a certain distance, and if they have any thing to Convey to the\r\nOccupents of this little hospital they Stand at the distance of 50 or\r\n60 paces and throw it towards them as far as they Can and retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 5, 1806]\r\nMonday May 5th 1806.\r\nCollected our horses and set out at 7 A.M. at 41/2 miles we arrived at\r\nthe entrance of the Kooskooske, up the N. Eastern side of which we\r\ncontinued our march 12 ms. to a large lodge of 10 families having\r\npassed two other large mat lodges the one at 5 and the other at 8 Ms.\r\nfrom the mouth of the Kooskooske but not being able to obtain any\r\nprovision at either of those lodges continued our march to the third\r\nwhere we arrived at 1 P.M. & with much difficulty obtained 2 dogs and a\r\nsmall quanty of root bread and dryed roots. at the second lodge we\r\npassed an indian man gave Capt. C. a very eligant grey mare for which\r\nhe requested a phial of eye-water which was accordingly given him.\r\nwhile we were encamped last fall at the entrance of the Chopunnish\r\nriver Capt. C. gave an indian man some volitile linniment to rub his\r\nkee and thye for a pain of which he complained, the fellow soon after\r\nrecovered and has never ceased to extol the virtues of our medecines\r\nand the skill of my friend Capt C. as a phisician. this occurrence\r\nadded to the benefit which many of them experienced from the eyewater\r\nwe gave them about the same time has given them an exalted opinion of\r\nour medicine. my friend Capt. C. is their favorite phisician and has\r\nalready received many applications. in our present situation I think it\r\npardonable to continue this deseption for they will not give us any\r\nprovision without compensation in merchandize and our stock is now\r\nreduced to a mere handfull. we take care to give them no article which\r\ncan possibly oinjure them. we foud our Chopunnish guide at this lodge\r\nwith his family. the indians brought us Capt. Clark's horse from the\r\noposite side of the river and delivered him to us while here. this\r\nhorse had by some accedent seperated from our other horses above and\r\nhad agreeably to indian information been in this neighbourhood for some\r\nweeks. while at dinner an indian fellow verry impertinently threw a\r\npoor half starved puppy nearly into my plait by way of derision for our\r\neating dogs and laughed very heartily at his own impertinence; I was so\r\nprovoked at his insolence that I caught the puppy and thew it with\r\ngreat violence at him and struk him in the breast and face, siezed my\r\ntomahawk and shewed him by signs if he repeated his insolence I would\r\ntommahawk him, the fellow withdrew apparently much mortifyed and I\r\ncontinued my repast on dog without further molestation. after dinner we\r\ncontinued our rout 4 miles to the entrance of Colter's Creek about 1/2\r\na mile above the rapid where we sunk the 1st canoe as we decended the\r\nriver last fall. we encamped on the lower side of this creek at a\r\nlittle distance from two lodges of the Chopunnish nation having\r\ntraveled 201/2 ms. today. one of these lodges contained eight families,\r\nthe other was much the largest we have yet seen. it is 156 feet long\r\nand about 15 wide built of mats and straw. in the form of the roof of a\r\nhouse having a number of small doors on each side, is closed at the\r\nends and without divisions in the intermediate space this lodge\r\ncontained at least 30 families. their fires are kindled in a row in the\r\ncenter of the house and about 10 feet assunder.\r\n\r\nall the lodges of these people are formed in this manner. we arrived\r\nhere extreemly hungry and much fatiegued, but no articles of\r\nmerchandize in our possession would induce them to let us have any\r\narticle of provision except a small quantity of bread of cows and some\r\nof those roots dryed. we had several applications to assist their sick\r\nwhich we refused unless they would let us have some dogs or horses to\r\neat. a man whose wife had an absess formed on the small of her back\r\npromised a horse in the morning provided we would administer to her\r\naccordingly Capt. C. opened the absess introduced a tent and dressed it\r\nwith basilicon; I prepared some dozes of the flour of sulpher and creem\r\nof tarter which were given with directions to be taken on each morning.\r\na little girl and sundry other patients were offered for cure but we\r\nposponed our operations untill morning; they produced us several dogs\r\nbut they were so poor that they were unfit for use. This is the\r\nresidence of one of 4 principal Cheifs of the nation whom they call\r\nNeesh-ne,-park-ke-ook or the cut nose from the circumstance of his nose\r\nbeing cut by the snake indians with a launce in battle. to this man we\r\ngave a medal of the small size with the likeness of the President. he\r\nmay be a great cheif but his countenance has but little inteligence and\r\nhis influence among his people seems but inconsiderable. a number of\r\nindians beside the inhabitants of these lodges geathered about us this\r\nevening and encamped in the timbered bottom on the creek near us. we\r\nmet with a snake indian man at this place through whome we spoke at\r\nsome length to the natives this evening with rispect to the objects\r\nwhich had induced us to visit their country. this address was induced\r\nat this moment by the suggestions of an old man who observed to the\r\nnatives that he thought we were bad men and had come most probably in\r\norder to kill them. this impression if really entertained I beleive we\r\neffaced; they appeared well satisfyed with what we said to them, and\r\nbeing hungry and tired we retired to rest at 11 oClock.--We-ark-koomt\r\nrejoined us this evening. this man has been of infinite service to us\r\non several former occasions and through him we now offered our address\r\nto the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 5, 1806]\r\nMonday May 5th 1806\r\nCollected our horses and Set out at 7 A M. at 41/2 ms. we arived at the\r\nenterance of Kooskooske, up the N E. Side of which we continued our\r\nMarch 12 Miles to a large lodge of 10 families haveing passed two other\r\nlarge mat lodges the one at 5 and the other at 8 Miles from the Mouth\r\nof the Kooskooske, but not being able to obtain provisions at either of\r\nthose Lodges continued our March to the 3rd where we arived at 1 P.M.\r\nand with much dificuelty obtained 2 dogs and a Small quantity of bread\r\nand dryed roots. at the Second Lodge of Eight families Capt L. & my\r\nself both entered Smoked with a man who appeared to be a principal man.\r\nas we were about to leave his lodge and proceed on our journey he\r\nbrought foward a very eligant Gray mare and gave her to me, requesting\r\nSome eye water. I gave him a phial of Eye water a handkerchief and some\r\nSmall articles of which he appeared much pleased-. While we were\r\nencamped last fall at the enterance of Chopunnish river, I gave an\r\nIndian man some volitile leniment to rub his knee and thye for a pain\r\nof which he Complained. the fellow Soon after recovered and have never\r\nSeased to extol the virtue of our medicines. near the enterance of the\r\nKooskooske, as we decended last fall I met with a man, who Could not\r\nwalk with a tumure on his thye. this had been very bad and recovering\r\nfast. I gave this man a jentle pirge cleaned & dressed his Sore and\r\nleft him Some Casteel Soap to wash the Sore which Soon got well. this\r\nman also assigned the restoration of his leg to me. those two cures has\r\nraised my reputation and given those nativs an exolted oppinion of my\r\nSkill as a phician. I have already received maney applications. in our\r\npresent Situation I think it pardonable to continue this deception for\r\nthey will not give us any provisions without Compensation in\r\nmerchendize, and our Stock is now reduced to a mear handfull. we take\r\nCare to give them no article which Can possibly injure them. and in\r\nmaney Cases can administer & give Such Medicine & Sergical aid as will\r\neffectually restore in Simple Cases &c. We found our Chopunnish Guide\r\nwith his family. the Indians brought my horse which was left at the\r\nplace we made Canoes, from the opposit Side and delivered him to me\r\nwhile here. this horse had by Some accident Seperated from our other\r\nhorses above, and agreeably to indian information had been in this\r\nneighbourhood Some weeks. while at dinner an indian fellow very\r\nimpertinently threw a half Starved puppy nearly into the plate of Capt.\r\nLewis by way of derision for our eating dogs and laughed very heartily\r\nat his own impertinence; Capt L.--was So provoked at the insolence that\r\nhe cought the puppy and threw it with great violence at him and Struck\r\nhim in the breast and face, Seazed his tomahawk, and Shewed him by Sign\r\nthat if he repeeted his insolence that he would tomahawk him, the\r\nfellow withdrew apparently much mortified and we continued our Dinner\r\nwithout further Molestation. after dinner we continued our rout 4 miles\r\nto the enterance of Colter's Creek about 1/2 a mile above the rapid\r\nwhere we Sunk the 1st Canoe as we decended the river last fall. We\r\nencamped on the lower Side of this Creek a little distance from two\r\nLodges of the Chopunnish nation haveing traviled 201/2 miles to day one\r\nof those Lodges Contained 8 families, the other was much the largest we\r\nhave yet seen. it is 156 feet long and about 15 feet wide built of mats\r\nand Straw, in the form of the roof of a house haveing a number of Small\r\ndores on each Side, is closed at the ends and without divisions in the\r\nintermediate Space. this lodge at least 30 families. their fires are\r\nkindled in a row in the Center of the Lodge and about 10 feet assunder.\r\nall the Lodges of these people are formed in this manner. we arrived\r\nhere extreemly hungary and much fatigued, but no articles of\r\nmerchindize in our possession would induce them to let us have any\r\narticle of Provisions except a Small quantity of bread of Cows and some\r\nof those roots dryed. We had Several applications to assist their Sick\r\nwhich we refused unless they would let us have Some dogs or horses to\r\neat. a man whose wife had an absess formed on the Small of her back\r\npromised a horse in the morning provided we would administer to her, I\r\nexamined the absess and found it was too far advanced to be cured. I\r\ntold them her case was desperate. agreeably to thir request I opened\r\nthe absess. I then introduced a tent and dressed it with bisilican; and\r\nprepared Some dozes of the flour of Sulpher and Creem of tarter which\r\nwere given with directions to be taken on each morning. a little girl\r\nand Sundery other patients were brought to me for Cure but we posponed\r\nour opperations untill the morning; they produced us Several dogs but\r\nthey were So pore that they were unfit to eat. This is the residence of\r\none of four principal Cheafs of the nation whome they call\r\nNeesh-ne-park-ke-ook or the Cut nose from the circumstance of his nose\r\nbeing Cut by the Snake Indians with a launce in battle. to this man we\r\ngave a Medal of the Small Size with a likeness of the President. he may\r\nbe a great Chief but his Countinance has but little inteligence and his\r\ninfluence among his people appears very inconsiderable. a number of\r\nIndians besides the inhabitents of these Lodges gathered about us this\r\nevening and encamped in the timbered bottom on the Creek near us. We\r\nmet with a Snake indian man at this place through whome we Spoke at\r\nSome length to the nativs this evening with respect to the object which\r\nhad enduced us to visit their Country. this address was induced at this\r\nmoment by the Suggestions of an old man who observed to the nativs that\r\nhe thought we were bad men and had Come most probably in order to kill\r\nthem.--this impression if really entertained I believe we effected;\r\nthey appeared well Satisfied with what we Said to them, and being\r\nhungary and tired we retired to rest at 11 oClock.--We-ark-koomt\r\nrejoined us this evening. this man has been of infinate Service to us\r\non Several former occasions and through him we now offered our address\r\nto the nativs-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 6, 1806]\r\nTuesday May 6th 1806.\r\nThis morning the husband of the sick woman was as good as his word, he\r\nproduced us a young horse in tolerable order which we immediately\r\nkilled and butchered. the inhabitants seemed more accomodating this\r\nmorning; they sold us some bread. we received a second horse for\r\nmedecine and prescription for a little girl with the rheumatism. Capt.\r\nC. dressed the woman again this morning who declared that she had\r\nrested better last night than she had since she had been sick. sore\r\neyes is an universal complaint with all the natives we have seen on the\r\nwest side of the Rocky mountains. Capt. C. was busily engaged for\r\nseveral hours this morning in administering eye-water to a croud of\r\napplicants. we once more obtained a plentifull meal, much to the\r\ncomfort of all the party. I exchanged horses with We-ark'-koomt and\r\ngave him a small flag with which he was much gratifyed. the sorrel I\r\nobtained is an eligant strong active well broke horse perfictly\r\ncalculated for my purposes. at this place we met with three men of a\r\nnation called the Skeets-so-mish who reside at the falls of a large\r\nriver disharging itself into the Columbia on it's East side to the\r\nNorth of the entrance of Clark's river. this river they informed us\r\nheaded in a large lake in the mountains and that the falls below which\r\nthey resided was at no great distance from the lake. these people are\r\nthe same in their dress and appearance with the Chopunnish, tho their\r\nlanguage is intirely different a circumstance which I did not learn\r\nuntill we were about to set out and it was then too late to take a\r\nvocabulary. The river here called Clark's river is that which we have\r\nheretofore called the Flathead river, I have thus named it in honour of\r\nmy worthy friend and fellow traveller Capt. Clark. for this stream we\r\nknow no indian name and no whiteman but ourselves was ever on it's\r\nprincipal branches. the river which Fidler calls the great lake river\r\nmay possibly be a branch of it but if so it is but a very\r\ninconsiderable branch and may as probably empty itself into the\r\nSkeetssomish as into that river. the stream which I have heretofore\r\ncalled Clark's river has it's three principal sources in mountains\r\nHood, Jefferson & the Northern side of the S. W. Mountains and is of\r\ncourse a short river. this river I shall in future call the\r\nTo-wannahiooks river it being the name by which it is called by the\r\nEneshur nation. The Kooskooske river may be safely navigated at present\r\nall the rocks of the shoals and rapids are perfectly covered; the\r\ncurrent is strong, the water clear and cold. this river is rising\r\nfast.The timber of this river which consists principally of the long\r\nleafed pine commences about 2 miles below our present camp on Colter's\r\nCreek. it was two oclock this evening before we could collect our\r\nhorses. at 3 P.M. we set out accompanyed by the brother of the twisted\r\nhair and We arkkoomt. I directed the horse which we had obtained for\r\nthe purpose of eating to be led as it was yet unbroke, in performing\r\nthis duty a quarrel ensued between Drewyer and Colter. we continued our\r\nmarch this evening along the river 9 miles to a lodge of 6 families,\r\nbuilt of sticks mats & dryed hay in the same form of those heretofore\r\ndiscribed. we passed a lodge of 3 families at 4 ms. on the road. no\r\nprovision of any discription was to be obtained of these people. a\r\nlittle after dark our young horse broke the rope by which he was\r\nconfined and made his escape much to the chagrine of all who\r\nrecollected the keenness of their appetites last evening. the brother\r\nof the twisted hair and Wearkkoomt with 10 or 12 others encamped with\r\nus this evening.-\r\n\r\nthe natives have a considerable salmon fishery up Colter's Creek. this\r\nstream extends itself to the pirs of the rocky mountain and in much the\r\ngreater part of it's course passes through a well timbered pine country\r\nit is 25 yds. wide and discharges a large body of water. the banks low\r\nand bed formed of pebbles.--had a small shower of rain this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 6, 1806]\r\nTuesday May 6th 1806\r\nThis morning the Susband of the Sick woman was as good as his word. he\r\nproduced us a young horse in tolerable order which we imedeately had\r\nkilled and butchered. the inhabitents Seemed more accommodating this\r\nmorning. they Sold us Some bread. we received a Second horse for\r\nMedecine & procription to a little girl with the rhumitism whome I had\r\nbathed in worm water, and anointed her a little with balsom Capivia. I\r\ndressed the woman again this morning who declared that She had rested\r\nbetter last night than She had Since She had been sick. Sore Eyes is an\r\nuniversal Complaint among all the nations which we have Seen on the\r\nWest Side of the rocky Mountains. I was busily imployed for several\r\nhours this morning in administering eye water to a Croud of applicants.\r\nwe once more obtained a plentiful meal, much to the Comfort of all the\r\nparty. Capt Lewis exchanged horses with We ark koomt and gave him a\r\nsmall flag with which he was much pleased and gratifyed. the Sorrel\r\nwhich Cap L. obtained is a Strong active well broke horse-. At this\r\nplace we met with three men of a nation Called the Skeetsso-mish who\r\nreside at the falls of a Small river dischargeing itself into the\r\nColumbia on its East Side to the South of the enterance of Clarks\r\nriver. this river they informed us headed in a large lake in the\r\nmountains and that the falls below which they reside was at no great\r\ndistance from the lake. these people are the Same in their dress and\r\nappearance with the Chopunnish, tho their language is entirely\r\ndifferent. one of them gave me his whip which was a twisted Stick 18\r\nIns. in length at one end a pice of raw hide Split So as to form two\r\nStrings about 20 inches in length as a lash, to the other end a String\r\npassed through a hole and fastened at each end for a loope to Slip over\r\nthe wrist. I gave in return for this whip a fathom of narrow binding.\r\nThe River here Calld. Clarks river is that which we have heretofore\r\nCalled Flathead river. Capt. Lewis has thought proper to Call this\r\nafter myself for this Stream we know no Indhan name and no white man\r\nbut our Selves was ever on this river. The river which Fiddler call's\r\nthe great Lake river may possiably be a branch of it, but if So it is\r\nbut a very inconsiderable branch, and may as probably empty itself into\r\nthe Columbia above as into Clarks river. the Stream which the party has\r\nheretofore Called Clarks river imedeately above the great falls, has\r\nit's three principal branches in Mountains Jefferson, Hood and the\r\nNorthern Side of the S. W. Mountains and is of course a Short river.\r\nthis river is Called by the Skillutes & Eneshure Nations Towannahhiooks\r\nwhich is also the name they Call those bands of Snake indians who Come\r\non this river every Spring to Catch the Salmon-.

We Continued our march along the river on\r\nits North Side 9 miles to a lodge of 6 families built of Sticks mats\r\nand dryed Hay. of the Same form of those heretofore discribed. we\r\npassed a Lodge of 3 families at 4 ms. on the river, no provisions of\r\nany discription was to be obtained of these people. a little after dark\r\nour young horse broke the rope by which he was Confined and made his\r\nescape much to the chagrine of all who recollected the keenness of\r\ntheir appetites last evening. the brother of the twisted hair &\r\nwearkkoomt with 10 others encamped with us this evening\r\n\r\nThe nativs have a Considerable Salmon fishery up Colters Creek. this\r\nStream extends itself to the Spurs of the Rocky Mountain and in much\r\nthe greater part of its Course passes through a well timbered pine\r\nCountry. it is 25 yds. wide and discharges a large body of water. the\r\nbanks low and bead formed of pebbles-. had a Small Shower of rain this\r\nevening. The Chopunnish about the Mouth of the Kooskooske bury their\r\ndead on Stoney hill Sides generally, and as I was informed by an Indian\r\nwho made Signs that they made a hole in the Grown by takeing away the\r\nStones and earth where they wished to deposit the dead body after which\r\nthey laid the body which was previously raped in a robe and Secured\r\nwith Cords. over the body they placed Stones So as to form a Sort of\r\narch on the top of which they put Stones and earth So as to Secure the\r\nbody from the wolves and birds &c. they Sometimes inclose the grave\r\nwith a kind of Sepulcher like the roof of a house formed of the canoes\r\nof the disceased. they also Sacrifice the favorite horses of the\r\ndisceased. the bones of many of which we See on and about the graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 7, 1806]\r\nWednesday May 7th 1806.\r\nThis morning we collected our horses and set out early accompanyed by\r\nthe brother of the twisted hair as a guide; Wearkkoomt and his party\r\nleft us. we proceeded up the river 4 miles to a lodge of 6 families\r\njust below the entrance of a small creek, here our guide recommended\r\nour passing the river. he informed us that the road was better on the\r\nSouth side and that game was more abundant also on that side near the\r\nentrance of the Chopunnish river. we determined to pursue the rout\r\nrecommended by the guide and accordingly unloaded our horses and\r\nprepared to pass the river which we effected by means of one canoe in\r\nthe course of 4 hours. a man of this lodge produced us two canisters of\r\npowder which he informed us he had found by means of his dog where they\r\nhad been buried in a bottom near the river some miles above, they were\r\nthe same which we had buryed as we decended the river last fall. as he\r\nhad kept them safe and had honesty enough to return them to us we gave\r\nhim a fire steel by way of compensation. during our detention at the\r\nriver we took dinner, after which or at 3 P.M. we renewed our march\r\nalong the river about 2 ms. over a difficult stony road, when we left\r\nthe river and asscended the hills to the wright which are here\r\nmountains high. the face of the country when you have once ascended the\r\nriver hills is perfectly level and partially covered with the\r\nlongleafed pine. the soil is a dark rich loam thickly covered with\r\ngrass and herbatious plants which afford a delightfull pasture for\r\nhorses. in short it is a beautifull fertile and picteresque country.\r\nNeeshneparkeeook overtook us and after riding with us a few miles\r\nturned off to the wright to visit some lodges of his people who he\r\ninformed me were geathering roots in the plain at a little distance\r\nfrom the road. our guide conducted us through the plain and down a\r\nsteep and lengthey hill to a creek which we called Musquetoe Creek in\r\nconsequence of being infested with swarms of those insects on our\r\narrival at it. this is but an inconsiderable stream about 6 yds. wide\r\nheads in the plains at a small distance and discharges itself into the\r\nKooskooke 9 miles by water below the entrance of the Chopunnish river.\r\nwe struck this creek at the distance of 5 ms. from the point at which\r\nwe left the river our cours being a little to the S. of East. ascending\r\nthe creek one mile on the S.

The Chopunnish bury their\r\ndead in different ways as I have obseved, besides that already\r\ndiscribed they scaffold Some and deposit others in Sepulchers, those\r\nare rearly to be Seen in this upper part of the Columbian Waters. the\r\none already discribed is the most Common. they all Sacrifice horses,\r\nCanoes and every Species of property to the dead. the bones of maney\r\nhorses are Seen lyeing about those repositaries of the dead &c.-.\r\n\r\nI observed in all the Lodges which we have passed Since we Crossed\r\nLewis's river decoys, or Stocking heads as they are Sometimes called.\r\nthese decoys are for the deer and is formed of the Skin of the head and\r\nupper portion of the neck of that animale extended in the nateral Shape\r\nby means of a fiew little Sticks placed within. the hunter when he Sees\r\na deer conseals himself and with his hand givs to the decoy the action\r\nof a deer at feed, and this induces the deer within arrowshot; in this\r\nmode the Indians near the woody country hunt on foot in Such places\r\nwhere they cannot pursue the deer with horses which is their favourite\r\nmethod when the grounds will permit-.-.

Sheilds returned with a small deer on\r\nwhich we breakfasted. by 11 A.M. all our hunters returned, Drewyer and\r\nCruzatte brought each a deer, Collins wounded another which my dog\r\ncaught at a little distance from the camp. our stock of provision now\r\nconsisted of 4 deer and the remnant of the horse which we killed at\r\nColter's Creek. Sheilds killed a duck of an uncommon kind. the head\r\nbeak and wing of which I preserved. the beak is remarkably wide and\r\nobtusely pointed, on it's edges it is furnished with a sceries of teeth\r\nvery long and fine not unlike the teeth of a comb. the belley is of a\r\nbrick red, the lower part of the neck white, the upper part or but of\r\nthe wing is a sky blue, underneath which a narrow stripe of white\r\nsucceeds marking the wing transversly, the large feathers are of a dark\r\ncolour. tail short and pointed and consists of 12 dark brown feathers.\r\nthe back is black and sides white; legs yellow and feet formed like the\r\nDuckinmallard which it also resembles in size and form. the eye is\r\nmoderately large, puple black and iris of an orrange colour. the\r\ncolours and appearance of the female is precisely that of the\r\nduckinmallard only, reather smaller. we are informed that the natives\r\nin this quarter were much distressed for food in the course of the last\r\nwinter; they were compelled to collect the moss which grows on the pine\r\nwhich they boiled and eat; near this camp I observed many pine trees\r\nwhich appear to have been cut down about that season which they inform\r\nus was done in order to collect the seed of the longleafed pine which\r\nin those moments of distress also furnishes an article of food; the\r\nseed of this speceis of pine is about the size and much the shape of\r\nthe seed of the large sunflower; they are nutricious and not unpleasent\r\nwhen roasted or boiled, during this month the natives also peal this\r\npine and eat the succulent or inner bark. in the creek near our\r\nencampment I observed a falling trap constructed on the same plan with\r\nthose frequent seen in the atlantic states for catching the fish\r\ndecending the stream Capt. C. took several small trout from this trap.\r\nNeesh-ne-park-kee-ook and several other indians joined us this morning.\r\nwe gave this cheif and the indians with us some venison, horsebeef, the\r\nentrels of the four deer, and four fawns which were taken from two of\r\nthe does that were killed, they eat none of their food raw, tho the\r\nentrals had but little preperation and the fawns were boiled and\r\nconsumed hair hide and entrals. these people sometimes eat the flesh of\r\nthe horse tho they will in most instances suffer extreem hunger before\r\nthey will kill their horses for that purpose, this seems reather to\r\nproceede from an attatchment to this animal, than a dislike to it's\r\nflesh for I observe many of them eat very heartily of the horsebeef\r\nwhich we give them. The Shoshone man was displeased because we did not\r\ngive him as much venison as he could eat and in consequence refused to\r\ninterpret, we took no further notice of him and in the course of a few\r\nhours he became very officious and seemed anxious to reinstate himself\r\nin our good opinons. the relation of the twisted hair and\r\nNeeshneparkkeook gave us a sketch of the principall watercourses West\r\nof the Rocky Mountains a copy of which I preserved; they make the main\r\nSouthwardly branch of Lewis's river much more extensive than the other,\r\nand place many villages of the Shoshonees on it's western side. at half\r\nafter 3 P.M. we departed; for the lodge of the Twisted hair accompanyed\r\nby the Cheif and sundry other indians. the relation of the twisted hair\r\nleft us. the road led us up a steep and high hill to a high and level\r\nplain mostly untimbered, through which we passed parrallel with the\r\nriver about 4 miles when we met the Twisted hair and a party of six\r\nmen. to this Cheif we had confided the care of our horses and a part of\r\nour saddles when we decended the river last fall. the Twisted hair\r\nreceived us very coolly an occurrence as unexpected as it was\r\nunaccountable to us. he shortly began to speak with a loud voice and in\r\na angry manner, when he had ceased to speak he was answered by the\r\nCutnose Cheif or Neeshneparkkeook; we readily discovered that a violet\r\nquarrel had taken place between these Cheifs but at that instant knew\r\nnot the cause; we afterwards learnt that it was on the subject of our\r\nhorses. this contreversy between the cheifs detained us about 20\r\nminutes; in order to put an end to this dispute as well as to releive\r\nour horses from the embarasment of their loads, we informed the Cheifs\r\nthat we should continue our march to the first water and encamp\r\naccordingly we moved on and the Indians all followed. about two miles\r\non the road we arrived at a little branch which run to the wright. here\r\nwe encamped for the evening having traveled 6 miles today. the two\r\ncheifs with their little bands formed seperate camps at a short\r\ndistance from ours, they all appeared to be in an ill humour. we had\r\nbeen informed some days since that the natives had discovered the\r\ndeposit of our saddles and taken them away and that our horses were\r\nmuch scattered. we were very anxious to learn the particulars or truth\r\nof these reports from the twisted hair, as it must in some measure\r\ngovern us in the establishment of our perminent camp which in\r\nconsequence of our detention by the snow of the mountains has become\r\nnecessary. to obtain our horses and saddles as quickly as possible is\r\nour wish, and we are somewhat apprehensive that this difference which\r\nhas taken place between these Chiefs may millitate against our\r\noperations in this rispect. we were therefore desireous to bring about\r\na good understanding between them as soon as possible. The Shoshone boy\r\nrefused to speak, he aledged it was a quarrel between two Cheifs and\r\nthat he had no business with it; it was in vain that we urged that his\r\ninterpreting what we said on this subject was not taking the responsibil\r\nity of the inteference on himself, he remained obstenately silent.\r\nabout an hour after we had encamped Drewyer returned from hunting we\r\nsent him to the Twisted hair to make some enquiries relative to our\r\nhorses and saddles and to ask him to come and smoke with us. The\r\nTwisted hair accepted the invitation and came to our fire. The twisted\r\nhair informed us that accordingly to the promis he had made us when he\r\nseperated from us at the falls of the Columbia he collected our horses\r\non his return and took charge of them, that about this time the Cutnose\r\nor Neeshneparkkeook and Tun-nach'-emoo-tools or the broken arm returned\r\nfrom a war excurtion against the Shoshonees on the South branch of\r\nLewis's river which had caused their absence when we were in this\r\nneighbourhood. that these men became dissatisfyed with him in\r\nconsequence of our having confided the horses to his care and that they\r\nwere eternally quarreling with him insomuch that he thought it best as\r\nhe was an old man to relinquish any further attention to the horses,\r\nthat they had consequently become scattered; that most of the horses\r\nwere near this place, a part were in the forks between the Chopunnish\r\nand Kooskooske rivers and three or four others were at the lodge of the\r\nbroken Arm about half a days march higher up the river. he informed us\r\nwith rispect to our saddles that on the rise of the water this spring\r\nthe earth had fallen from the door of the cash and exposed the saddles,\r\nhe being informed of their situation had taken them up and placed them\r\nin another cash where they were at this time; he said it was probable\r\nthat a part of them had fallen into the water but of this he was not\r\ncertain. The Twisted hair said if we would spend the day tomorrow at\r\nhis lodge which was a few miles only from hence and on the road leading\r\nto the Broken arm's lodge, he would collect such of our horses as were\r\nnear this place and our saddles, that he would also send some young men\r\nover the Kooskooske to collect those in the forks and bring them to the\r\nlodge of the broken Arm to met us. he advised us to go to the lodge of\r\nthe broken Arm as he said he was a Cheif of great emenence among them,\r\nand promised to accompany us thither if we wished him. we told him that\r\nwe should take his advice in every particular, that we had confided the\r\nhorses to his care and expected that he would collect them and deliver\r\nthem to us which when he performed we should pay him the two guns and\r\namunition we had promised him for that service. he seemed much pleased\r\nand promised his utmost exertions. we sent Drewyer to the Cutnose who\r\nalso came to our fire and smoked with ourselves and the Twisted hair we\r\ntook occasion in the course of the evening to express our regret that\r\nthere should be a misunderstanding between these Cheifs; the Cutnose\r\ntold us in the presents of the Twisted hair that he the twisted hair\r\nwas a bad old man that he woar two faces, that in stead of taking care\r\nof our horses as he had promised us that he had suffered his young men\r\nto ride them hunting and had injured them very much; that this was the\r\ncause why himself and the Broken arm had forbid his using them. the\r\nother made no reply. we informed the Cutnose of our intention of\r\nspending tomorrow at the Twisted hair's lodge in order to collect our\r\nhorses and saddles and that we should proceede the next day to the\r\nBroken Arm's lodge, he appeared well satisfyed with this arrangement\r\nand said he would continue with us, and would give us any assistance in\r\nhis power; he said he knew the broken arm expected us at his lodge and\r\nthat he had two bad horses for us, metaphorically speaking a present of\r\ntwo good horses. he said the broken arm had learnt our want of\r\nprovision and had sent four of his young men with a supply to meet us\r\nbut that they had taken a different road and had missed us.--about 10\r\nP.M. our guests left us and we layed down to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 8, 1806]\r\nThursday 8th of May 1806.\r\nThis morning our hunters was out by the time it was light. about 8\r\noClock Shields brought in a Small deer, on which we brackfast by 11\r\nA.M. all our hunters returned Drewyer & P.

Total of\r\nour Stock of provisions 4 deer & Some horse flesh. on the Small Creek\r\nwhich passes our Camp, the nativs have laterly encamped and as we are\r\ninformed have been much distressed for provisions, they have fallen a\r\nnumber of Small pine in the vicinity of this Encampment for the Seed\r\nwhich is in the bur of which they eate. we are informed that they were\r\nCompelled to Collect the moss off the pine boil & eate it in the latter\r\npart of the last Winter. on the Creek near our Camp I observed a kind\r\nof trap which was made with great panes to catch the Small fish which\r\npass down with the Stream This was a dam formed of Stone So as to\r\nCollect the water in a narrow part not exceeding 3 feet wide from which\r\nplace the water Shot with great force and Scattered through Some Small\r\nwillows Closely connected and fastened with bark. this mat of willow\r\nSwitches was about 4 feet wide and 6 long lying in a horozontal\r\nposition, fastened at the extremety. the Small fish which fell on those\r\nwillows was washed on the Willows where they untill taken off &c. I\r\ncought or took off those willows 9 Small trout from 3 to 7 Inches in\r\nlength. Soon after I returned from the fishery an Indian came from a\r\nfishery of a Similar kind a little above with 12 Small fish which he\r\noffered me which I declined axcepting as I found from his Signs that\r\nhis house was a Short distance above, and that those fisheries afforded\r\nthe principal part of the food for his Children. The Great Chief of the\r\nBands below who has a cut nose joined us this morning. we gave the\r\ninterals with 4 young fauns which was in two of the deer killed to day\r\nto the Indians also some of our deer & horse flesh. the Paunch of the\r\ndeer they eate without any preperation further than washing them a\r\nlittle. the fauns they boiled and eate every part of them even the\r\nSkins with the hair. The Snake Indian was much displeased that he was\r\nnot furnished with as much Deer as he could eate. he refused to Speake\r\nto the wife of Shabono, through whome we Could understand the nativs.\r\nwe did not indulge him and in the after part of the day he Came too and\r\nSpoke verry well. one of the Indians drew me a Sketch of the river (See\r\nthe latter part of this book) in this Sketch he makes the 1st large\r\nSoutherly fork of Lewis's river much the longest and on which great\r\nnumbers of the Snake Indians reside &c. at ____ P.M. we loaded up and\r\nSet on on the roade leading as we were informed to the lodge of the\r\ntwisted hair, the Chief in whoes Care we had left our horses. we were\r\naccompanied by the Cut nose Chief our old Chief who had accompanied us\r\ndown the river and Several men. we assended the hills which was Steep\r\nand emencely high to a leavel rich Country thinly timbered with pine.\r\nwe had not proceeded more than 4 miles before we met the twisted hair\r\nand Several men meeting of us. we were verry coolly recved by the\r\ntwisted hair. he Spoke aloud and was answered by the Cut Nose. we Could\r\nnot learn what they Said. but plainly discovered that a\r\nmissunderstanding had taken place between them. we made Signs to them\r\nthat we Should proceed on to the next water and encamp. accordingly I\r\nset out and they all followed. we had not proceeded far before the road\r\nCrossed a Small handsom Stream on which we encamped. The parties of\r\nthose two Chiefs took different positions at Some distance from each\r\nother and all appeared Sulkey. after we had formed our Camp we Sent\r\nDrewyer with a pipe to Smoke with the twisted hair and lern the Cause\r\nof the dispute between him and the Cut nose, and also to invite him to\r\nour fire to Smoke with us. The twisted hair came to our fire to Smoke\r\nwe then Sent drewyer to the Cut Noses fire with the Same directions. he\r\nreturned and informed us that the Cut nose Said he would join us in a\r\nfiew minits. it appears that the Cause of the quarrel between those two\r\nmen is about our horses. and we cannot lern the particulars of this\r\nquarrel which probably originated through jelousy on the part of the\r\nCut nose who blames the twisted hair for Suffer our horses to be rode,\r\nand want water dureing the Winter &c. twisted hair Says the horses were\r\ntaken from him &c. The Cut nose joined us in a Short time We Smoked\r\nwith all the party of both Chiefs, and told them that we were Sorry to\r\nfind them at varience with each other the cut nose said that the\r\ntwisted hair was a bad man and wore two fases, that he had not taken\r\ncare of our horses as was expected. that himself an the broken arm had\r\nCaused our horses to be Watered in the winter and had them drove\r\ntogether, and that if we would proceed on to the village of the great\r\nChief whome we had left a flag last fall the broken arm he would Send\r\nfor our horses, that he had himself three of them. he also informed us\r\nthat the great Chief hering of our distressed Situation had Sent his\r\nSon and 4 men to meet us and have us furnished on the way &c. that the\r\nyoung men had missed us and Could never over take us untill this time.\r\nthat the great chief had 2 bad horses for us and expected us to go to\r\nhis lodge which was near the river and about half a days march above\r\n&c. The twisted hair told us that he wished to Smoke with us at his\r\nlodge which was on the road leading to the Great Chiefs lodge, and but\r\na fiew miles a head. if we would delay at his lodge tomorrow he would\r\ngo after our Saddles and horses which was near the place we made our\r\nCanoes last fall. we deturmined to Set out early in the morning and\r\nproceed on to the lodge of the twisted hair and Send for our Saddles\r\nand powder which we had left burried mear the forks. and the day after\r\ntomorrow to proceed on to the lodge of the Grand Chief. accordingly we\r\ninformed the Indians of our intentions. we all Smoked and conversed\r\nuntill about 10 P M. the Indians retired and we lay down. Derected 5\r\nhunters to turn out early in the morning to hunt and meet us at the\r\ntwisted hair's lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 9, 1806]\r\nFriday May 9th 1806.\r\nWe sent out several hunters early this morning with instructions to\r\nmeet us at the lodge of the Twisted hair. Collecting our horses\r\ndetained us untill 9 A.M. when we charged our packhorses and set out.\r\nour rout lay through a level rich country similar to that of yesterday;\r\nat the distance of 6 miles we arrived at the lodge of the twisted hair;\r\nthis habitation was built in the usual form with sticks mats and dryed\r\nhay, and contained 2 firs and about 12 persons. even at this small\r\nhabitation there was an appendage of the soletary lodge, the retreat of\r\nthe tawny damsels when nature causes them to be driven into coventry;\r\nhere we halted as had been previously concerted, and one man with 2\r\nhorses accompayed the twisted hair to the canoe camp, about 4 ms. in\r\nquest of the saddles. the Twisted hair sent two young men in surch of\r\nour horses agreeably to his promis. The country along the rocky\r\nmountains for several hundred miles in length and about 50 in width is\r\nlevel extreemly fertile and in many parts covered with a tall and open\r\ngrowth of the longleafed pine. near the watercouses the hills are steep\r\nand lofty tho are covered with a good soil not remarkably stony and\r\npossess more timber than the level country. the bottom lands on the\r\nwatercourses are reather narrow and confined tho fertile & seldom\r\ninundated. this country would form an extensive settlement; the climate\r\nappears quite as mild as that of similar latitude on the Atlantic coast\r\nif not more so and it cannot be otherwise than healthy; it possesses a\r\nfine dry pure air. the grass and many plants are now upwards of knee\r\nhigh. I have no doubt but this tract of country if cultivated would\r\nproduce in great abundance every article essentially necessary to the\r\ncomfort and subsistence of civillized man. to it's present inhabitants\r\nnature seems to have dealt with a liberal hand, for she has distributed\r\na great variety of esculent plants over the face of the country which\r\nfurnish them a plentiful) store of provision; these are acquired with\r\nbut little toil, and when prepared after the method of the natives\r\nafford not only a nutricious but an agreeable food. among other roots\r\nthose called by them the Quawmash and Cows are esteemed the most\r\nagreeable and valuable as they are also the most abundant. the cows is\r\na knobbed root of an irregularly rounded form not unlike the Gensang in\r\nform and consistence. this root they collect, rub of a thin black rhind\r\nwhich covers it and pounding it expose it in cakes to the sun. these\r\ncakes ate about an inch and 1/4 thick and 6 by 18 in width, when dryed\r\nthey either eat this bread alone without any further preperation, or\r\nboil it and make a thick muselage; the latter is most common and much\r\nthe most agreeable. the flavor of this root is not very unlike the\r\ngensang.--this root they collect as early as the snows disappear in the\r\nspring and continue to collect it until) the quawmash supplys it's\r\nplace which happens about the latter end of June. the quawmash is also\r\ncollected for a few weaks after it first makes it's appearance in the\r\nspring, but when the scape appears it is no longer fit for use untill\r\nthe seed are ripe which happens about the time just mentioned, and then\r\nthe cows declines. the latter is also frequently dryed in the sun and\r\npounded afterwards and then used in making soope.--I observed a few\r\ntrees of the larch and a few small bushes of the balsam fir near the\r\nlodge of the Twisted hair. at 2 P.M. our hunters joined us Drewyer\r\nkilled a deer but lost it in the river. a few pheasants was the produce\r\nof the hunt. we procured a few roots of cows of which we made scope.\r\nlate in the evening The Twisted hair and Willard returned; they brought\r\nabout half of our saddles, and some powder and lead which had been\r\nburied at that place. my saddle was among the number of those which\r\nwere lost. about the same time the young men arrived with 21 of our\r\nhorses. the greater part of our horses were in fine order. five of them\r\nappeared to have been so much injured by the indians riding them last\r\nfall that they had not yet recovered and were in low order. three\r\nothers had soar backs. we had these horses caught and hubbled. the\r\nsituation of our camp was a disagreeable one in an open plain; the wind\r\nblew violently and was cold. at seven P.M. it began to rain and hail,\r\nat 9 it was succeeded by a heavy shower of snow which continued untill\r\nthe next morning.--several indians joined us this evening from the\r\nvillage of the broken arm or Tunnachemootoolt and continued all night.\r\nThe man who had imposed himself on us as a relation of the twisted hair\r\nrejoined us this evening we found him an impertinent proud supercilious\r\nfellow and of no kind of rispectability in the nation, we therefore did\r\nnot indulge his advances towards a very intimate connection. The\r\nCutnose lodged with the twisted hair I beleive they have become good\r\nfriends again. several indians slept about us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 9, 1806]\r\nFriday 9th May 1806\r\nThe hunters Set out very early agreeable to their derections. we were\r\ndetained untill 9 A.M. for our horses which were much Scattered at\r\nwhich time we Collected our horses and Set out and proceeded on through\r\na butifull open rich Country for 6 miles to the Camp of the twisted\r\nhair. this Campment is formed of two Lodges built in the usial form of\r\nmats and Straw. the largest and principal Lodge is Calculated for 2\r\nfires only and Contains about ____ persons. the Second lodge is Small &\r\nappears to be intended for the Sick women who always retire to a\r\nSeperate lodge when they have the ____ this Custom is Common to all the\r\nnations on this river as well as among all other Indian nations with\r\nwhom I am acquainted. at the distance of 2 miles we passd. a lodge of 2\r\nfires on a fork of the road which leads to the right Situated on a\r\nSmall branch which falls into Musquetor Creek. before 2 P M all our\r\nhunters joined us haveing killed only one deer which was lost in the\r\nriver and a pheasent. Soon after we halted at the lodge of the twisted\r\nhair he Set out with two boys and Willard with a pack horse down to the\r\nriver near the place we made the Canoes for our Saddles and a Cannister\r\nof powder and Some lead buried there, also a part of our horses which\r\nresorted near that place. late in the evening they returned with 21 of\r\nour horse and about half of our Saddles with the powder and ball. The\r\ngreater part of the horses were in fine order, tho five of them had\r\nbeen rode & worsted in Such a manner last fall by the Inds. that they\r\nhad not recovered and are in very low order, and 3 with Sore backs. we\r\nhad all the recovered horses Cought & hobbled. we precured Some pounded\r\nroots of which a Supe was made thick on which we Suped. the wind blew\r\nhard from the S. W. accompanied with rain untill from 7 oClock untill 9\r\nP.M. when it began to Snow and Continued all night. Several Indians\r\nCame from the village of the Chief with whome we had left a flag and\r\nContinued with us all night. they slept in the house of the twisted\r\nhair and two of them along Side of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 10, 1806]\r\nSaturday May 10th 1806.\r\nThis morning the snow continued falling 1/2 after 6 A.M. when it\r\nceased, the air keen and cold, the snow 8 inches deep on the plain; we\r\ncollected our horses and after taking a scant breakfast of roots we set\r\nout for the village of Tunnachemootoolt; our rout lay through an open\r\nplain course S. 35 E. and distance 16 ms. the road was slippery and the\r\nsnow clogged to the horses feet, and caused them to trip frequently.\r\nthe mud at the sources of the little ravines was deep black and well\r\nsupplyed with quawmash. Drewyer turned off to the left of the road in\r\norder to hunt and did not join us this evening. at 4 in the afternoon\r\nwe decended the hills to Commearp Creek and arrived at the Village of\r\nTunnachemootoolt, the cheeif at whos lodge we had left a flag last\r\nfall. this flag was now displayed on a staff placed at no great\r\ndistance from the lodge. underneath the flag the Cheif met my friend\r\nCapt. C. who was in front and conducted him about 80 yds. to a place on\r\nthe bank of the creek where he requested we should encamp; I came up in\r\na few minutes and we collected the Cheifs and men of consideration\r\nsmoked with them and stated our situation with rispect to provision.\r\nthe Cheif spoke to his people and they produced us about 2 bushels of\r\nthe Quawmas roots dryed, four cakes of the bread of cows and a dryed\r\nsalmon trout. We thanked them for this store of provision but informed\r\nthem that our men not being accustomed to live on roots alone we feared\r\nit would make them sick, to obviate which we proposed exchangeing a\r\ngood horse in reather low order for a young horse in tolerable order\r\nwith a view to kill. the hospitality of the cheif revolted at the aydea\r\nof an exchange, he told us that his young men had a great abundance of\r\nyoung horses and if we wished to eat them we should by furnished with\r\nas many as we wanted. accordingly they soon produced us two fat young\r\nhorses one of which we killed, the other we informed them we would\r\npospone killing untill we had consumed the one already killed. This is\r\na much greater act of hospitality than we have witnessed from any\r\nnation or tribe since we have passed the Rocky mountains. in short be\r\nit spoken to their immortal honor it is the only act which deserves the\r\nappellation of hospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter. we\r\ninformed these people that we were hungry and fatiegued at this moment,\r\nthat when we had eaten and refreshed ourselves we would inform them who\r\nwe were, from whence we had come and the objects of our resurches. a\r\nprincipal Cheif by name Ho-hast,-ill-pilp arrived with a party of fifty\r\nmen mounted on eligant horses. he had come on a visit to us from his\r\nvillage which is situated about six miles distant near the river. we\r\ninvited this man into our circle and smoked with him, his retinue\r\ncontinued on horseback at a little distance. after we had eaten a few\r\nroots we spoke to them as we had promised; and gave Tinnachemootoolt\r\nand Hohastillpilp each a medal; the former one of the small size with\r\nthe likeness of Mr. Jefferson and the latter one of the sewing medals\r\nstruck in the presidency of Washington, we explained to them the\r\ndesighn and the importance of medals in the estimation of the whites as\r\nwell as the red men who had been taught their value. The Cheif had a\r\nlarge conic lodge of leather erected for our reception and a parsel of\r\nwood collected and laid at the door after which he invited Capt. C. and\r\nmyself to make that lodge our home while we remained with him. we had a\r\nfire lighted in this lodge and retired to it accompanyed by the Cheifs\r\nand as many of the considerate men as could croud in a circcle within\r\nit. here after we had taken a repast on some horsebeef we resumed our\r\ncouncil with the indians which together with smoking the pipe occupyed\r\nthe ballance of the evening. I was surprised to find on decending the\r\nhills of Commearp Cr. to find that there had been no snow in the\r\nbottoms of that stream. it seems that the snow melted in falling and\r\ndecended here in rain while it snowed on the plains. the hills are\r\nabout six hundred feet high about one fourth of which distance the snow\r\nhad decended and still lay on the sides of the hills. as these people\r\nhad been liberal with is with rispect to provision I directed the men\r\nnot to croud their lodge surch of food in the manner hunger has\r\ncompelled them to do at most lodges we have passed, and which the\r\nTwisted hair had informed me was disgreeable to the natives. but their\r\nprevious want of hospitality had induced us to consult their\r\nenclinations but little and suffer our men to obtain provision from\r\nthem on the best terms they could. The village of the broken arm as I\r\nhave heretofore termed it consists of one house only which is 150 feet\r\nin length built in the usual form of sticks matts and dry grass. it\r\ncontains twenty four fires and about double that number of families.\r\nfrom appearances I presume they could raise 100 fighting men. the noise\r\nof their women pounding roots reminds me of a nail factory. The indians\r\nseem well pleased, and I am confident that they are not more so than\r\nour men who have their somachs once more well filled with horsebeef and\r\nmush of the bread of cows.--the house of coventry is also seen here.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 10, 1806]\r\nSaturday 10th of May 1806\r\nThis morning the Snow continued falling untill 1/2 past 6 A M when it\r\nSeased. the air keen and Cold the Snow 8 inches deep on the plain. we\r\nCollected our horses and after takeing a Scanty brackfast of roots, we\r\nSet out for the Village of the Chief with a flag, and proceeded on\r\nthrough an open plain. the road was Slipry and the Snow Cloged and\r\ncaused the horses to trip very frequently. the mud at heads of the\r\nStreams which we passed was deep and well Supplied with the Car mash.\r\nDrewyer turned off the road to hunt near the river to our lef and did\r\nnot join us to day. at 4 P M we arrived at the Village of Tin\r\nnach-e-moo-toolt the Chief whome We had left a flag. this flag was\r\nhoisted on a pole unde the flag the Chief met me and Conducted me to a\r\nSpot near a Small run about 80 paces from his Lodges where he requested\r\nme to halt which I did. Soon after Cap Lewis who was in the rear Came\r\nup and we Smoked with and told this Chief our Situation in respect to\r\nprovisions. they brought foward about 2 bushels of quawmash 4 Cakes of\r\nbread made of roots and a dried fish. we informed the Chief that our\r\nParty was not accustomed to eate roots without flesh & proposed to\r\nexchange Some of our oald horses for young ones to eate. they Said that\r\nthey would not exchange horses, but would furnish us with Such as we\r\nwished, and produced 2 one of which we killed and informd. them that we\r\ndid not wish to kill the other at this time. we gave Medals to the\r\nbroken arm or Tin-nach-e-moo tolt and Hoh-halt-ill-pitp two principal\r\nChiefs of the Chopunnish Natn. and was informed that there was one\r\nother Great Chief (in all 4) who had but one eye. he would be here\r\ntomorrow. a large Lodge of Leather was pitched and Capt. Lewis and my\r\nSelf was envited into it. we entered and the Chief and principal men\r\ncame into the lodge and formed a Circle a parcel of wood was Collected\r\nand laid at the dore and a fire made in this Conic lodge before we\r\nentered it. the Chief requested that we might make the Lodge our homes\r\nwhile we remained with him. here after we had taken a repast on roots &\r\nhorse beef we resumed our Council with the indians which together with\r\nSmokeing took up the ballance of the evening. I was Supprised to find\r\ndecending the hill to Commearp Creek to find that there had been no\r\nsnow in the bottoms of that Stream. it seams that the Snow melted in\r\nfalling and decended here in rain while it snowed in the plain. the\r\nhills are about Eight hundred feet high about 1/4 of which distance the\r\nSnow had decended and Still lay on the Sides of the hill. as those\r\npeople had been liberal I directed the men not to croud their Lodge in\r\nserch of food the manner hunger has Compelled them to do, at most\r\nlodges we have passed, and which the Twisted Hair had informed us was\r\ndisagreeable to the nativs. but their previous want of hospitality had\r\nenduced us to consult their enclinations but little and Suffer our men\r\nto obtain provisions from them on the best terms they could.\r\n\r\nThe Village of the broken Arm consists of one house or Lodge only which\r\nis 150 feet in length built in the usial form of Sticks, Mats and dry\r\ngrass. it contains 24 fires and about double that number of families.\r\nfrom appearance I prosume they could raise 100 fighting men. the noise\r\nof their women pounding the cows roots remind me of a nail factory. The\r\nIndians appear well pleased, and I am Confident that they are not more\r\nso than our men who have their Stomach once more well filled with horse\r\nbeef and the bread of cows. Those people has Shewn much greater acts of\r\nhospitallity than we have witnessed from any nation or tribe Since we\r\nhave passed the rocky Mountains. in Short be it Spoken to their\r\nimmortal honor it is the only act which diserves the appelation of\r\nhospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 11, 1806]\r\nSunday May 11th 1806.\r\nThe last evening we were much crouded with the indians in our lodge,\r\nthe whole floor of which was covered with their sleeping carcases. we\r\narrose early and took breakfast. at 8 A.M. a Cheif of great note among\r\nthese people arrived from his village or lodge on the S. side of\r\nLewis's River. this is a stout fellow of good countenance about 40\r\nyears of age and has lost the left eye. his name is Yoom-park'-kar-tim.\r\nto this man we gave a medal of the smal kind. those with the likeness\r\nof Mr. Jefferson have all been disposed of except one of the largest\r\nsize which we reserve for some great Cheif on the Yellow rock river. we\r\nnow pretty fully informed ourselves that Tunnachemootoolt,\r\nNeeshneparkkeeook, Yoomparkkartim and Hohastillpilp were the principal\r\nCheif of the Chopunnish nation and ranked in the order here mentioned;\r\nas all those cheifs were present in our lodge we thought it a\r\nfavourable time to repeat what had been said yesterday and to enter\r\nmore minutely into the views of our government with rispect to the\r\ninhabitants of this western part of the continent, their intention of\r\nestablishing trading houses for their releif, their wish to restore\r\npeace and harmony among the natives, the strength power and wealth of\r\nour nation &c. to this end we drew a map of the country with a coal on\r\na mat in their way and by the assistance of the snake boy and our\r\ninterpretters were enabled to make ourselves understood by them altho\r\nit had to pass through the French, Minnetare, Shoshone and Chopunnish\r\nlanguages. the interpretation being tedious it ocupyed nearly half the\r\nday before we had communicated to them what we wished. they appeared\r\nhighly pleased. after this council was over we amused ourselves with\r\nshewing them the power of magnetism, the spye glass, compass, watch,\r\nair-gun and sundry other articles equally novel and incomprehensible to\r\nthem. they informed us that after we had left the Minnetares last\r\nspring that three of their people had visited that nation and that they\r\nhad informed them of us and had told them that we had such things in\r\nour possession but that they could not place confidence in the\r\ninformation untill they had now witnessed it themselves.--A young man,\r\nson of a conspicuous Cheif among these people who was killed not long\r\nsince by the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie, brought and presented us a\r\nvery fine mare and colt. he said he had opened his ears to our councils\r\nand would observe them strictly, and that our words had made his heart\r\nglad. he requested that we would accept this mear and colt which he\r\ngave in token of his determination to pursue our advise.--about 3 P.M.\r\nDrewyer arrived with 2 deer which he had killed. he informed us that\r\nthe snow still continued to cover the plain. many of the natives apply\r\nto us for medical aid which we gave them cheerfully so far as our skill\r\nand store of medicine would enable us. schrofela, ulsers, rheumatism,\r\nsoar eyes, and the loss of the uce of their limbs are the most common\r\ncases among them. the latter case is not very common but we have seen\r\nthee instances of it among the Chopunnish. it is a very extraordinary\r\ncomplaint. a Cheif of considerable note at this place has been\r\nafflicted with it for three years, he is incapable of moving a single\r\nlimb but lies like a corps in whatever position he is placed, yet he\r\neats heartily, digests his food perfectly, injoys his understanding,\r\nhis pulse are good, and has retained his flesh almost perfectly, in\r\nshort were it not that he appears a little pale from having lain so\r\nlong in the shade he might well be taken for a man in good health. I\r\nsuspect that their confinement to a diet of roots may give rise to all\r\nthose disorders except the rheumatism & soar eyes, and to the latter of\r\nthese, the state of debility incident to a vegetable diet may\r\nmeasureably contribute.--The Chopunnish notwithstanding they live in\r\nthe crouded manner before mentioned are much more clenly in their\r\npersons and habitations than any nation we have seen since we left the\r\nOttoes on the river Platte.--The Twisted hair brought us six of our\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 11, 1806]\r\nSunday 11th May 1806\r\nSome little rain last night. we were Crouded in the Lodge with Indians\r\nwho continued all night and this morning Great numbers were around us.\r\nThe One Eyed Chief Yoom-park-kar-tim arived and we gave him a medal of\r\nthe Small Size and Spoke to the Indians through a Snake boy Shabono and\r\nhis wife. we informed them who we were, where we Came from & our\r\nintentions towards them, which pleased them very much. a young man Son\r\nto the great Chief who was killed not long Sence by the Indians from\r\nthe N. E. brought an elegant mare and Coalt and Gave us. and Said he\r\nhad opend. his ears to what we had Said and his heart was glad and\r\nrequested us to take this mare and Coalt as a token of his\r\ndeturmination to pursue our Councels &c. The twisted hair brough Six of\r\nour horses all in fine order. Great numbers of Indians apply to us for\r\nmedical aide which we gave them Cherfully So far as our Skill and Store\r\nof Medicine would enable us. Schrofla, ulsers, rhumitism, Sore eyes,\r\nand the loss of the use of their Limbs are the most common cases among\r\nthem. the latter Case is not very common but We have Seen 3 instances\r\nof it among the Chopunnish. a very extroadinery complnt. about 3 P.M.\r\nGeo. drewyer arived with 2 deer which he had killed. he informed us\r\nthat the Snow Still Continued to cover the plains. We are now pretty\r\nwell informed that Tunnachemootoolt, Hohastillpilp, Neshneparkkeeook,\r\nand Yoomparkkartim were the principal Chiefs of the Chopunnish Nation\r\nand ranked in the order here mentioned; as all those chiefs were\r\npresent in our lodge we thought it a favourable time to repeet what had\r\nbeen said and to enter more minutely into the views of our government\r\nwith respect to the inhabitents of this Western part of the Continent,\r\ntheir intention of establishing tradeing houses for their relief, their\r\nwish to restore peace and harmony among the nativs, the Strength welth\r\nand powers of our Nation &c. to this end we drew a map of the Country\r\nwith a coal on a mat in their way, and by the assistance of the Snake\r\nboy and our intrepeters were enabled to make ourselves under stood by\r\nthem altho it had to pass through French, Minnetare, Shoshone and\r\nChopunnish languages. the interpretation being tegious it occupied the\r\ngreater part of the day, before we had communicated to them what we\r\nwished. they appeared highly pleased. after this Council was over we\r\namused ourselves with Shewing them the power of Magnetism, the Spye\r\nglass, compass, watch, air gun and Sundery other articles equally novel\r\nand incomprehensible to them. they informed us that after we left the\r\nMenetares last Spring that 3 of their people had visited that nation,\r\nand that they had informed them of us, and had told them that we had\r\nSuch things in our possession but that they Could not place Confidence\r\nin the information untill they had now witnessed it themselves\r\n\r\nIn the evening a man was brought in a robe by four Indians and laid\r\ndown near me. they informed me that this man was a Chief of\r\nConsiderable note who has been in the Situation I see him for 5 years.\r\nthis man is incapable of moveing a single limb but lies like a corps in\r\nwhatever position he is placed, yet he eats hartily, dejests his food\r\nperfectly, enjoys his under standing, his pulse are good, and has\r\nretained his flesh almost perfectly; in Short were it not that he\r\nappears a little pale from having been So long in the Shade, he might\r\nwell be taken for a man in good health. I Suspect that their\r\nConfinement to a deet of roots may give rise to all the disordes of the\r\nNativs of this quarter except the Rhumitism & Sore eyes, and to the\r\nlatter of those, the State of debility incident to a vegitable diet may\r\nmeasureably contribute.-. The Chopunnish not withstanding they live in\r\nthe Crouded manner before mentioned are much more clenly in their\r\npersons and habitations than any nation we have Seen Sence we left the\r\nIllinois. These nativs take their fish in the following manner to wit.\r\na Stand Small Stage or warf consisting of Sticks and projecting about\r\n10 feet into the river and about 3 feet above the water on the\r\nextremity of this the fisherman stands with his guilt or a Skooping Net\r\nwhich differ but little in their form those Commonly used in our\r\nCountry it is formed thus with those nets they take the Suckers and\r\nalso the Salmon trout and I am told the Salmon also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 12, 1806]\r\nMonday May 12th 1806.\r\nThis morning a great number of indians collected about us as usual. we\r\ntook an early breakfast and Capt. C. began to administer eyewater to a\r\ncroud of at least 50 applicants. The Indians held a council among\r\nthemselves this morning with rispect to the subjects on which we had\r\nspoken to them yesterday. the result as we learnt was favourable. they\r\nplaced confidence in the information they had received and resolved to\r\npusue our advise. after this council was over the principal Cheif or\r\nthe broken Arm, took the flour of the roots of cows and thickened the\r\nscope in the kettles and baskets of all his people, this being ended he\r\nmade a harangue the purport of which was making known the deliberations\r\nof their council and impressing the necessity of unanimity among them\r\nand a strict attention to the resolutions which had been agreed on in\r\ncouncill; he concluded by inviting all such men as had resolved to\r\nabide by the decrees of the council to come and eat and requested such\r\nas would not be so bound to shew themselves by not partaking of the\r\nfeast. I was told by one of our men who was present, that there was not\r\na dissenting voice on this great national question, but all swallowed\r\ntheir objections if any they had, very cheerfully with their mush.\r\nduring the time of this loud and animated harangue of the Cheif the\r\nwomen cryed wrung their hands, toar their hair and appeared to be in\r\nthe utmost distress. after this cerimony was over the Cheifs and\r\nconsiderate men came in a body to where we were seated at a little\r\ndistance from our tent, and two young men at the instance of the\r\nnation, presented us each with a fine horse. we caused the cheifs to be\r\nseated and gave them each a flag a pound of powder and fifty balls. we\r\nalso gave powder and ball to the two young men who had presented the\r\nhorses. Neeshneeparkkeeook gave Drewyer a good horse. The band of\r\nTen-nach-e-moo-toolt have six guns which they acquired from the\r\nMinnetaries and appear anxious to obtain arms and amunition. after they\r\nhad received those presents the Cheifs requested we would retire to the\r\ntent whither they accompanied us, they now informed us that they wished\r\nto give an answer to what we had said to them the preceeding day, but\r\nalso informed us that there were many of their people waiting in great\r\npain at that moment for the aid of our medecine. it was agreed between\r\nCapt. C. and myself that he should attend the sick as he was their\r\nfavorite phisician while I would here and answer the Cheifs. The father\r\nof Hohastillpilp was the orrator on this occasion. he observed that\r\nthey had listened with attention to our advise and that the whole\r\nnation were resolved to follow it, that they had only one heart and one\r\ntongue on this subject. he said they were fully sensible of the\r\nadvantages of peace and that the ardent desire which they had to\r\ncultivate peace with their neighbours had induced his nation early last\r\nsummer to send a pipe by 3 of their brave men to the Shoshonees on the\r\nS. side of Lewis's river in the Plains of Columbia, that these people\r\nhad murdered these men, which had given rise to the war expedition\r\nagainst that nation last fall; that their warriors had fallen in with\r\nthe shoshonees at that time and had killed 42 of them with the loss of\r\n3 only on their part; that this had satisfyed the blood of their\r\ndisceased friends and that they would never again make war against the\r\nShoshonees, but were willing to receive them as friends. that they\r\nvalued the lives of their young men too much to wish them to be engaged\r\nin war. That as we had not yet seen the black foot Indians and the\r\nMinnetares of Fort de Prarie they did not think it safe to venture over\r\nto the Plains of the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided\r\nthose nations would not kill them. that when we had established our\r\nforts on the Missouri as we had promised, they would come over and\r\ntrade for arms Amunition &c. and live about us. that it would give them\r\nmuch pleasure to be at peace with these nations altho they had shed\r\nmuch of their blood. he said that the whitemen might be assured of\r\ntheir warmest attatchment and that they would alwas give them every\r\nassistance in their power; that they were poor but their hearts were\r\ngood. he said that some of their young men would go over with us to the\r\nMissouri and bring them the news as we wished, and that if we could\r\nmake a peace between themselves and their enimies on the other side of\r\nthe mountain their nation would go over to the Missouri in the latter\r\nend of the summer. on the subject of one of their cheifs accompanying\r\nus to the Land of the whitemen they could not yet determine, but that\r\nthey would let us know before we left them. that the snow was yet so\r\ndeep in the mountain if we attempted to pass we would certainly perish,\r\nand advised us to remain untill after the next full moon when the said\r\nthe snow would disappear and we could find grass for our horses.--when\r\nthe oald man had concluded I again spoke to them at some length with\r\nwhich they appeared highly gratifyed. after smoking the pipe which was\r\nabout 2 P.M. they gave us another fat horse to kill which was\r\nthankfully received by the party. Capt C. now joined us having just\r\nmade an end of his medical distrabution. we gave a phiol of eyewater to\r\nthe Broken Arm, and requested that he would wash the eyes of such as\r\nmight apply for that purpose, and that when it was exhausted we would\r\nreplenish the phiol. he was much pleased with this present. we now gave\r\nthe Twisted hair one gun and a hundred balls and 2 lbs. of powder in\r\npart for his attention to our horses and promised the other gun and a\r\nsimilar quantity of powder and lead when we received the ballance of\r\nour horses. this gun we had purchased of the indians below for 2\r\nElkskins. this evening three other of our original stock of horses were\r\nproduced, they were in fine order as well as those received yesterday.\r\nwe have now six horses out only, as our old guide Toby and his son each\r\ntook a horse of ours when they returned last fall. these horses are\r\nsaid to be on the opposite side of the river at no great distance from\r\nthis place. we gave the young men who had delivered us the two horses\r\nthis morning some ribbon, blue wampum and vermillion, one of them gave\r\nme a hansome pare of legings and the Broken Arm gave Capt. C. his\r\nshirt, in return for which we gave him a linin shirt.--we informed the\r\nindians of our wish to pass the river and form a camp at some proper\r\nplace to fish, hunt, and graize our horses untill the snows of the\r\nmountains would permit us to pass. they recommended a position a few\r\nmiles distant from hence on the opposite side of the river, but\r\ninformed us that there was no canoe at this place by means of which we\r\ncould pass our baggage over the river, but promised to send a man early\r\nin the morning for one which they said would meet us at the river by\r\nnoon the next day. The indians formed themselves this evening into two\r\nlarge parties and began to gamble for their beads and other ornaments.\r\nthe game at which they played was that of hiding a stick in their hands\r\nwhich they frequently changed acompanying their opperations with a\r\nsong. this game seems common to all the nations in this country, and\r\ndose not differ from that before discribed of the Shoshonees on the S.\r\nE. branch of Lewis's river. we are anxious to procure some guides to\r\naccompany us on the different routs we mean to take from Travellers\r\nrest; for this purpose we have turned our attention to the Twisted hair\r\nwho has several sons grown who are well acquainted as well as himself\r\nwith the various roads in those mountains. we invited the old fellow to\r\nremove his family and live near us while we remained; he appeared\r\ngratifyed with this expression of our confidence and promissed to do\r\nso.--shot at a mark with the indians, struck the mark with 2 balls.\r\ndistn. 220 yds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 12, 1806]\r\nMonday 12th May 1806\r\na fine Morning great number of Indians flock about us as usial. after\r\nbrackfast I began to administer eye water and in a fiew minits had near\r\n40 applicants with Sore eyes, and maney others with other Complaints\r\nmost Common Rhumatic disorders & weaknesses in the back and loins\r\nperticularly the womin. the Indians had a grand Council this morning\r\nafter which we were presented each with a horse by two young men at the\r\ninstance of the nation. we caused the chiefs to be Seated and gave then\r\neach a flag a pint of Powder and 50 balls to the two young men who had\r\npresented the horses we also gave powder and ball. The broken arm or\r\nTun na the mootoolt pulled off his leather Shirt and gave me. I in\r\nreturn gave him a Shirt. we retired into the Lodge and the natives\r\nSpoke to the following purpote, i e they had listened to our advice and\r\nthat the whole nation were deturmined to follow it, that they had only\r\none heart and one tongue on this Subject. explained the Cause of the\r\nWar with the Shoshones. they wished to be at peace with all nations &\r\nSome of their Men would accompany us to the Missouri &c. &c. as a great\r\nnumber of men women & Children were wateing and requesting medical\r\nassistance maney of them with the most Simple Complaints which Could be\r\neasily releived, independent of maney with disorders intirely out of\r\nthe power of Medison all requesting Some thing, we agreed that I Should\r\nadminister and Capt L--to here and answer the Indians. I was closely\r\nemployed until 12 P.M. administering eye water to about 40 grown\r\npersons. Some Simple Cooling Medicenes to the disabled Chief, to\r\nSeveral women with rhumatic effections & a man who had a Swelled hip\r\n&c. &c-. in the evening three of our horses were brought all in fine\r\norder. we have now only Six remaining out. we gave to each a Chief a\r\npint of Powder and 50 Balls a Small flag and to the two young men who\r\ndelivered us the horses we gave also powder & Ball and Some blue wompom\r\n& ribin. all appeared much pleased-. Those people are much affraid of\r\nthe black foot indians, and the Big bellies of Fort deprarie\r\nestablishment. those indians kill great numbers of this nation whenever\r\nthey pass over to hunt on the Missouri. one of our men bought a horse\r\nfor a fiew Small articles of an Indian. The Indians brought up a fat\r\nhorse and requested us to kill and eate it as they had nothing else to\r\noffer us to eate. The Cut nose made a present of a horse to Drewyer at\r\nthe Same time the two horses were offered to Capt. Lewis & my self. The\r\nhorses of those people are large well formed and active. Generally in\r\nfine order. Sore backs Caused by rideing them either with out Saddles,\r\nor with pads which does not prevent the wate of the rider pressing\r\nimedeately on the back bone, and weathers of the horse. the Indians\r\nformed two partis and plaied for their heeds. we gave the twisted hair\r\na gun, powder & 100 ball in part for takeing care of our horses &c.\r\n\r\nand wish him to Camp near us untill we Crossed the Mountains which he\r\nagreeed to do, and was much pleased we have turned our attentions\r\ntowards the twisted hair who has Several Sons grown who are well\r\nacquainted as well as himself with the various roads through the rocky\r\nMountains and will answer very well as guides to us through those\r\nMountains-In the Council to day the father of Hohastillpelp Said the\r\nChopunnish were fully Convinced of the advantages of peace and ardently\r\nwished to cultivate peace with their neighbours. early last Summer 3 of\r\ntheir brave men were Sent with a pipe to the Shoshones on the S E. fork\r\nof Lewis's river in the Plains of Columbia, their pipe was disreguarded\r\nand their 3 men murdered, which had given rise to the War expedition\r\nagainst that nation last fall; that their warriers had fallen in with\r\nand killed 42 of the Shoshones with the loss of 3 men only on their\r\npart; that this had Satisfied the blood of the deceased friends and\r\nthey would never again make war against the Shoshones, but were willing\r\nto receve them as friends-. That as we had not Seen the Indians towards\r\nFort de prere they did not think it Safe to venture over to the Plains\r\nof the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided those nations\r\nwould not kill them. I gave a vial of eye water to the Broken arm for\r\nto wash the eyes of all who applied to him and told him when it was out\r\nwe would replenish it again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 13, 1806]\r\nTuesday May 13th 1806.\r\nThis morning Capt. C. as usual was busily engaged with his patients\r\nuntill eleven OCk. at 1 P.M. we collected our horses and set out for\r\nthe river escorted by a number of the natives on horseback. we followed\r\nthe creek downwards about two miles, passing a stout branch at 1 m.\r\nwhich flowed in on the wright. our course S. E. we now entered an\r\nextensive open bottom of the Kooskooske R. through which we passed\r\nnearly N. about 11/2 miles and halted on the bank of the river at the\r\nplace appointed to meet the canoe. the man had set out early this\r\nmorning for the purpose but had not yet arrived with the canoe we\r\ntherefore unloaded our horses and turned them out to graize. as the\r\ncanoe did not arrive untill after sunset we remained here all night; a\r\nnumber of the natives continued with us. in the evening we tryed the\r\nspeed of several of our horses. these horses are active strong and well\r\nformed. these people have immence numbers of them 50, 60 or a hundred\r\nhed is not unusual for an individual to possess. The Chopunnish are in\r\ngeneral stout well formed active men. they have high noses and many of\r\nthem on the acqueline order with cheerfull and agreeable countenances;\r\ntheir complexions are not remarkable. in common with other savage\r\nnations of America they extract their beards but the men do not\r\nuniformly extract the hair below, this is more particularly confined to\r\nthe females. I observed several men among them whom I am convinced if\r\nthey had shaved their beards instead of extracting it would have been\r\nas well supplyed in this particular as any of my countrymen. they\r\nappear to be cheerfull but not gay; they are fond of gambling and of\r\ntheir amusements which consist principally in shooting their arrows at\r\na bowling target made of willow bark, and in riding and exercising\r\nthemselves on horseback, racing &c. they are expert marksmen and good\r\nriders. they do not appear to be so much devoted to baubles as most of\r\nthe nations we have met with, but seem anxious always to obtain\r\narticles of utility, such as knives, axes, tommahawks, kettles blankets\r\nand mockerson alls. blue beads however may form an exception to this\r\nremark; this article among all the nations of this country may be\r\njustly compared to goald or silver among civilized nations. They are\r\ngenerally well cloathed in their stile. their dress consists of a long\r\nshirt which reaches to the middle of thye, long legings which reach as\r\nhigh as the waist, mockersons, and robes. these are formed of various\r\nskins and are in all rispects like those particularly discribed of the\r\nShoshones. their women also dress like the Shoshones. their ornaments\r\nconsist of beads shells and peices of brass variously attatched to\r\ntheir dress, to their ears arrond their necks wrists arms &c. a bando\r\nof some kind usually surrounds the head, this is most frequently the\r\nskin of some fir animal as the fox otter &c. tho they have them also of\r\ndressed skin without the hair. the ornament of the nose is a single\r\nshell of the wampum. the pirl and beads are suspended from the ears.\r\nbeads are woarn arround their wrists necks and over their sholders\r\ncrosswise in the form of a double sash. the hair of the men is cewed in\r\ntwo rolls which hang on each side in front of the body as before\r\ndiscribed of other inhabitants of the Columbia. collars of bears claws\r\nare also common; but the article of dress on which they appear to bstow\r\nmost pains and ornaments is a kind of collar or brestplate; this is\r\nmost commonly a strip of otterskin of about six inches wide taken out\r\nof the center of the skin it's whole length including the head. this is\r\ndressed with the hair on; a hole is cut lengthwise through the skin\r\nnear the head of the animal sufficiently large to admit the head of the\r\nperson to pass. thus it is placed about the neck and hangs in front of\r\nthe body the tail frequently reaching below their knees; on this skin\r\nin front is attatched peices of pirl, beads, wampum peices of red cloth\r\nand in short whatever they conceive most valuable or ornamental. I\r\nobserved a tippit woarn by Hohastillpilp, which was formed of human\r\nscalps and ornamented with the thumbs and fingers of several men which\r\nhe had slain in battle. their women brade their hair in two tresses\r\nwhich hang in the same position of those of the men. they also wear a\r\ncap or cup on the head formed of beargrass and cedar bark. the men also\r\nfrequently attatch some small ornament to a small plat of hair on the\r\ncenter of the crown of their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 13, 1806]\r\nTuesday 13th May 1806.\r\na fine morning I administered to the Sick and gave directions. we\r\ncollected all our horses and Set out at 1 P.M. and proceeded down the\r\nCreek to the Flat head River a Short distance below the enterance of\r\nthe Creek at the distance of 3 miles from the Village. at this place we\r\nexpected to have met the Canoe which was promised to be furnished us,\r\nand for which an indian Set out very early this morning. we halted at\r\nthe Flat Head River unloaded our horses and turnd. them out to feed.\r\nSeveral Indians accompanied us to the river and Continued untill\r\nevening. The man who Set out early this morning to the forks of this\r\nriver for a Canoe and was to meet us at this place. as the Canoe did\r\nnot arive untill after Sun set we remained all night; in the evening we\r\ntried the Speed of Several of our horses. these horses are strong\r\nactive and well formed. Those people have emence numbers of them 50 or\r\n60 or a Hundred head is not unusial for an individual to possess.\r\n\r\nThe Chopunnish are in general Stout well formd active men. they have\r\nhigh noses and maney of them on the acqueline order with chearfull and\r\nagreeable countinances; their complexions are not remarkable. in common\r\nwith other Indian Nations of America they extract their beard, but the\r\nmen do not uniformly extract the hair below, this is more particularly\r\nconfined to the females. they appear to be cheerfull but not gay; they\r\nare fond of gambling and of their amusements which consists principally\r\nin shooting their arrows at a targit made of Willow bark, and in\r\nrideing and exersiseing themselves on horsback, raceing &c. they are\r\nexpirt marks men & good riders. they do not appear to be So much\r\ndevoted to baubles as most of the nations we have met with, but Seen\r\nanxious always to riceve articles of utility, Such as knives, axes,\r\nKittles, blankets & Mockerson awls. blue beeds however may form an\r\nexception to this remark; This article among all the nations of this\r\nCountry may be justly compared to gold and Silver among civilized\r\nnations. They are generally well clothed in their Stile. their dress\r\nConsists of a long shirt which reaches to the middle of leg, long\r\nlegins which reach as high as the waist, mockersons & robe. those are\r\nformed of various skins and are in all respects like those of the\r\nShoshone. Their orniments consists of beeds, Shells and peices of brass\r\nvariously attached to their dress, to their ears arround theire necks\r\nwrists arms &c. a band of Some kind usially Serounds the head, this is\r\nmost frequently the Skin of Some fer animal as the fox otter &c.; I\r\nobserved a tippet worn by Hohastillpilp, which was formed of Humane\r\nScalps and ornemented with the thumbs and fingers of Several men which\r\nhe had Slain in battle. they also were a coller or breast plate of\r\notter Skin orniminted with Shells beeds & quills. the women brade their\r\nhair in two tresses which hang in the same position of those of the\r\nmen, which ar Cewed and hang over each sholder. &c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 14, 1806]\r\nWednesday May 14th 1806.\r\nThe morning was fair, we arrose early and dispatched a few of our\r\nhunters to the opposite side of the river, and employed a part of the\r\nmen in transporting our baggage to the opposite shore wile others were\r\ndirected to collect the horses; at 10 A.M. we had taken our baggage\r\nover and collected our horses, we then took breakfast, after which we\r\ndrove our horses into the river which they swam without accedent and\r\nall arrived safe on the opposite shore. the river is 150 yds. wide at\r\nthis place and extreemly rapid. tho it may be safely navigated at this\r\nseason, as the water covers all the rocks which lie in it's bed to a\r\nconsiderable debth. we followed our horses and again collected them,\r\nafter which we removed our baggage to a position which we had\r\npreviously selected for our permanent camp about half a mile below.\r\nthis was a very eligible spot for defence it had been an ancient\r\nhabitation of the indians; was sunk about 4 feet in the ground and\r\nraised arround it's outer edge about three 1/2 feet with a good wall of\r\neath. the whole was a circle of about 30 feet in diameter. arround this\r\nwe formed our tents of sticks and grass facing outwards and deposited\r\nour baggage within the sunken space under a shelter which we\r\nconstructed for the purpose. our situation was within 40 paces of the\r\nriver in an extentsive level bottom thinly timbered with the longleafed\r\npine. here we are in the vicinity of the best hunting grounds from\r\nindian information, are convenient to the salmon which we expect daily\r\nand have an excellent pasture for our horses. the hills to the E and\r\nNorth of us are high broken and but partially timbered; the soil is\r\nrich and affords fine grass. in short as we are compelled to reside a\r\nwhile in this neighbourhood I feel perfectly satisfyed with our\r\nposition.immediately after we had passed the river Tunnachemootoolt and\r\nHosastillpilp arrived on the south side with a party of a douzen of\r\ntheir young men; they began to sing in token of friendship as is their\r\ncustom, and we sent the canoe over for them. they left their horses and\r\ncame over accompanyed by several of their party among whom were the 2\r\nyoung men who had presented us with two horses in behalf of the nation;\r\none of these was the son of Tunnachemootoolt and the other the son of\r\nthe Cheif who was killed by the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie last year\r\nand the same who had given us the mare and Colt. we received them at\r\nour camp and smoked with them; after some hours Hohastillpilp with much\r\ncerimony presented me with a very eligant grey gelding which he had\r\nbrought for that purpose. I gave him in return a handkercheif 200 balls\r\nand 4 lbs. of powder. with which he appeared perfectly satisfyed.\r\nCollins killed two bear this morning and was sent with two others in\r\nquest of the meat; with which they returned in the evening; the mail\r\nbear was large and fat the female was of moderate size and reather\r\nmeagre. we had the fat bear fleaced in order to reserve the oil for the\r\nmountains. both these bear were of the speceis common to the upper part\r\nof the missouri. they may be called white black grzly brown or red bear\r\nfor they are found of all those colours. perhaps it would not be\r\nunappropriate to designate them the variagated bear. we gave the\r\nindians who were about 15 in number half the female bear, with the\r\nsholder head and neck of the other. this was a great treat to those\r\npoor wretches who scarcely taist meat once a month. they immediately\r\nprepared a brisk fire of dry wood on which they threw a parsel of\r\nsmooth stones from the river, when the fire had birnt down and heated\r\nthe stones they placed them level and laid on a parsel of pine boughs,\r\non these they laid the flesh of the bear in flitches, placing boughs\r\nbetween each course of meat and then covering it thickly with pine\r\nboughs; after this they poared on a small quantity of water and covered\r\nthe whoe over with earth to the debth of four inches. in this situation\r\nthey suffered it to remain about 3 hours when they took it out. I\r\ntaisted of this meat and found it much more tender than that which we\r\nhad roasted or boiled, but the strong flavor of the pine distroyed it\r\nfor my pallate. Labuish returned late in the evening and informed us\r\nthat he had killed a female bear and two large cubbs, he brought with\r\nhim several large dark brown pheasants which he had also killed.\r\nShannon also returned with a few pheasants and two squirrells. we have\r\nfound our stone horses so troublesome that we indeavoured to exchange\r\nthem with the Chopunnish for mears or gelings but they will not\r\nexchange altho we offer 2 for one; we came to a resolution to castrate\r\nthem and began the operation this evening one of the indians present\r\noffered his services on this occasion. he cut them without tying the\r\nstring of the stone as is usual, and assures us that they will do much\r\nbetter in that way; he takes care to scrape the string very clean and\r\nto seperate it from all the adhereing veigns before he cuts it. we\r\nshall have an opportunity of judging whether this is a method\r\npreferable to that commonly practiced as Drewyer has gelded two in the\r\nusual way. The indians after their feast took a pipe or two with us and\r\nretired to rest much pleased with their repast. these bear are\r\ntremendious animals to them; they esteem the act of killing a bear\r\nequally great with that of an enimy in the field of action.--I gave the\r\nclaws of those which Collins killed to Hohastillpilp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 14, 1806]\r\nWednesday 14th of May 1806\r\na fine day. we had all our horses Collected by 10 a.m. dureing the time\r\nwe had all our baggage Crossed over the Flat head River which is rapid\r\nand about 150 yards wide. after the baggage was over to the North Side\r\nwe Crossed our horss without much trouble and hobbled them in the\r\nbottom after which we moved a Short distance below to a convenient\r\nSituation and formed a Camp around a very conveniant Spot for defence\r\nwhere the Indiands had formerly a house under ground and hollow circler\r\nSpot of about 30 feet diamieter 4 feet below the Serfce and a Bank of 2\r\nfeet above this Situation we Concluded would be Seffiently convenient\r\nto hunt the wood lands for bear & Deer and for the Salmon fish which we\r\nwere told would be here in a fiew days and also a good Situation for\r\nour horses. the hills to the E. & N. of us are high broken & but\r\npartially timbered; the soil rich and affords fine grass. in Short as\r\nwe are Compelled to reside a while in this neighbourhood I feel\r\nperfectly Satisfied with our position. imediately after we had Crossed\r\nthe river the Chief Called the broken Arm or Tin nach-e-moo toll\r\nanother principal Chief Hoh-host'-ill-pitp arived on the opposite Side\r\nand began to Sing. we Sent the Canoe over and those Chiefs, the Son of\r\nthe broken arm and the Sone of a Great Chief who was killed last year\r\nby the Big bellies of Sas kas she win river. those two young men were\r\nthe two whome gave Capt Lewis and my self each a horse with great\r\nserimony in behalf of the nation a fiew days ago, and the latter a most\r\nelligant mare & colt the morning after we arived at the Village. Hohast\r\nill pilt with much Serimoney presented Capt. Lewis with an elegant Gray\r\nhorse which he had brought for that purpose. Capt Lewis gave him in\r\nreturn a Handkerchief two hundred balls and four pouds of powder with\r\nwhich he appeared perfictly Satisfyed, and appeared much pleased.\r\n\r\nSoon after I had Crossed the river and during the time Cap Lewis was on\r\nthe opposit Side John Collins whome we had Sent out verry early this\r\nmorning with Labiech and Shannon on the North Side of the river to\r\nhunt, Came in and informed me, that he had killed two Bear at about 5\r\nmiles distant on the up lands. one of which was in good order. I\r\nimediately depatched Jo. Fields & P. Wiser with him for the flesh. we\r\nmade Several attempts to exchange our Stalions for Geldings or mars\r\nwithout success we even offered two for one. those horses are\r\ntroublesom and Cut each other very much and as we Can't exchange them\r\nwe think it best to Castrate them and began the opperation this evening\r\none of the Indians present offered his Services on this occasion. he\r\nCut them without tying the String of the Stone as is usial. he Craped\r\nit very Clean & Seperate it before he Cut it. about Meredian Shannon\r\nCame in with two Grows & 2 Squireles Common to this Country. his\r\nmockersons worn out obliged to come in early.\r\n\r\nCollins returned in the evening with the two bears which he had killed\r\nin the morning one of them an old hee was in fine order, the other a\r\nfemale with Cubs was Meagure. we gave the Indians about us 15 in number\r\ntwo Sholders and a ham of the bear to eate which they cooked in the\r\nfollowing manner. to wit on a brisk fire of dryed wood they threw a\r\nparcel of Small Stones from the river, when the fire had burnt down and\r\nheated the Stone, they placed them level and laid on a parsel of pine\r\nboughs, on those they laid the flesh of the bear in flitches, placeing\r\nboughs between each course of meat and then Covering it thickly with\r\npine boughs; after this they poared on a Small quantity of water, and\r\nCovered the whole over with earth to the debth of 4 inches. in this\r\nSituation they Suffered it to remain about 3 hours when they took it\r\nout fit for use. at 6 oClock P M Labiech returned and informed us that\r\nhe had killed a female Bear and two Cubs, at a long distance from Camp\r\ntowards the mountains. he brought in two large dark brown pheasents\r\nwhich he had also killed Shannon also returned also with a few black\r\nPheasents and two squirels which he had killed in the wood land towards\r\nCollins Creek. This nation esteem the Killing of one of those\r\ntremendeous animals (the Bear) equally great with that of an enemy in\r\nthe field of action-. we gave the Claws of those bear which Collins had\r\nkilled to Hohastillpelp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 15, 1806]\r\nThursday May 15th 1806.\r\nThis morning early Reubin Fields in surching for his horse saw a large\r\nbear at no great distance from camp; several men went in pursuit of the\r\nbear, they followed his trail a considerable distance but could not\r\ncome up with him. Labuish and Shannon set out with a view to establish\r\na hunting camp and continuing several days, two others accompanyed them\r\nin order to bring in the three bear which Labuish had killed. Drewyer\r\nand Cruzatte were sent up the river; Sheilds R. Feilds and Willard\r\nhunted in the hills near the camp they returned in the evening with a\r\nfew pheasants only and reported that there was much late appearance of\r\nbear, but beleived that they had gone off to a greater distance. at 11\r\nA.M. the men returned with the bear which Labuich had killed. These\r\nbear gave me a stronger evidence of the various coloured bear of this\r\ncountry being one speceis only, than any I have heretofore had. The\r\nfemale was black with a considerable proportion of white hairs\r\nintermixed and a white spot on the breast, one of the young bear was\r\njut black and the other of a light redish brown or bey colour. the poil\r\nof these bear were infinitely longer finer and thicker than the black\r\nbear their tallons also longer and more blont as if woarn by diging\r\nroots. the white and redish brown or bey coloured bear I saw together\r\non the Missouri; the bey and grizly have been seen and killed together\r\nhere for these were the colours of those which Collins killed\r\nyesterday. in short it is not common to find two bear here of this\r\nspeceis precisely of the same colour, and if we were to attempt to\r\ndistinguish them by their collours and to denominate each colour a\r\ndistinct speceis we should soon find at least twenty. some bear nearly\r\nwhite have also been seen by our hunters at this place. the most\r\nstriking differences between this speceis of bear and the common black\r\nbear are that the former are larger, have longer tallons and tusks,\r\nprey more on other animals, do not lie so long nor so closely in winter\r\nquarters, and will not climb a tree tho eversoheardly pressed. the\r\nvariagated bear I beleive to be the same here with those on the\r\nmissouri but these are not as ferocious as those perhaps from the\r\ncircumstance of their being compelled from the scarcity of game in this\r\nquarter to live more on roots and of course not so much in the habit of\r\nseizing and devouring living animals. the bear here are far from being\r\nas passive as the common black bear they have attacked and faught our\r\nhunters already but not so fiercely as those of the Missouri. there are\r\nalso some of the common black bear in this neighbourhood. Frazier, J.\r\nFields and Wiser complain of violent pains in their heads, and Howard\r\nand York are afflicted with the cholic. I attribute these complaints to\r\ntheir diet of roots which they have not been accustomed.\r\nTunnachemootoolt and 12 of his young men left us this morning on their\r\nreturn to their village. Hohastillpilp and three old men remained\r\nuntill 5 in the evening when they also departed. at 1 P.M. a party of\r\n14 natives on horseback passed our camp on a hunting excurtion; they\r\nwere armed with bows and arrows and had decoys for the deer these are\r\nthe skins of the heads and upper portions of the necks of the deer\r\nextended in their natural shape by means of a fraim of little sticks\r\nplaced within. the hunter when he sees a deer conceals himself and with\r\nhis hand gives to the decoy the action of a deer at feed; and thus\r\ninduces the deer within arrowshot; in this mode the indians hunt on\r\nfoot in the woodlands where they cannot pursue the deer with horses\r\nwhich is their favorite method when the ground will permit.--we had all\r\nof our horses driven together today near our camp, which we have\r\ndirected shall be done each day in order to familiarize them to each\r\nother. several of the horses which were gelded yesterday are much\r\nswolen particularly those cut by Drewyer, the others bled most but\r\nappear much better today than the others.\r\n\r\nwe had our baggage better secured under a good shelter formed of grass;\r\nwe also strengthened our little fortification with pine poles and\r\nbrush, and the party formed themselves very comfortable tents with\r\nwillow poles and grass in the form of the orning of a waggon, these\r\nwere made perfectly secure as well from the heat of the sun as from\r\nrain. we had a bower constructed for ourselves under which we set by\r\nday and sleep under the part of an old sail now our only tent as the\r\nleather lodge has become rotten and unfit for use. about noon the sun\r\nshines with intense heat in the bottoms of the river. the air on the\r\ntom of the river hills or high plain forms a distinct climate, the air\r\nis much colder, and vegitation is not as forward by at least 15 or\r\nperhaps 20 days. the rains which fall in the river bottoms are snows on\r\nthe plain. at the distance of fifteen miles from the river and on the\r\nEastern border of this plain the Rocky Mountains commence and present\r\nus with winter it it's utmost extreem. the snow is yet many feet deep\r\neven near the base of these mountains; here we have summer spring and\r\nwinter within the short space of 15 or 20 miles.--Hohastillpilp and the\r\nthree old men being unable to pass the river as the canoe had been\r\ntaken away, returned to our camp late in the evening and remained with\r\nus all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 15, 1806]\r\nThursday 15th of May 1806\r\nThis morning Reubin Fields went out to hunt his horse very early and\r\nSaw a large bear and no great distance from Camp. Several men went in\r\npursute of the bear, and prosued his trail Some time without gitting\r\nSight of this Monster. Shannon went out with Labeach to hunt and\r\ncontinue out 3 days, Gibson and Hall accompanied them for the meat\r\nLabeech killed yesterday which they brought in by 11 A M. this Morning\r\nthe female was black with white hares intermixed and a white Spot on\r\nthe breast the Cubs were about the Size of a dog also pore. one of them\r\nvery black and the other a light redish brown or bey colour. These bear\r\ngive me a Stronger evidence of the various Coloured bear of this\r\nCountry being one Specie only, than any I have heretofore had. Several\r\nother Colours have been seen. Drewyer and Peter Crusat went up the\r\nriver. John Shields, R. Fields and Willard hunted in the hills near\r\nCamp and returned before 2 P. M without killing any thing except a fiew\r\nGrows. they saw but few deer. Some bear Sign. Frazur Jo. Fields and\r\nPeter Wizer Complain of a violent pain in their heads. Howard and York\r\nwith violent Cholicks. the Cause of those disorders we are unable to\r\naccount for. their diet and the Sudin Change of Climate must\r\ncontribute. The Great Chief Tin nach-e-moo-tolt (or broken Arm) and 12\r\nof the young men of his nation left us today about 11 oClock and\r\nCrossed the river to his Village Hoh-hast-ill-pilt and 3 old men\r\nContinued with us untill about 5 P. M when they left us and returnd. to\r\ntheir Village. a party of 14 Indians passed our Camp about 1 P.M. on\r\ntheir way to the leavel uplands to run and kill the deer with their\r\nhorses and Bows and arrows. Some of them were also provided with deers\r\nheads Cased for the purpose of decoying the deer. those men continued\r\nwithus but a fiew minits and proceeded on. Those people hunt most\r\nCommonly on horse back Seround the Deer or Goat which they find in the\r\nopen plains & kill them with their arrows. tho they Sometimes hunt the\r\ndeer on foot & decoy them. we had all of our horses drove together to\r\nday with a view to fermilurize them to each other. those that were Cut\r\nyesterday are Stiff and Several of them much Swelled. we had all our\r\nbaggage Secured and Covered with a rouf of Straw. our little\r\nfortification also completely Secured with brush around which our Camp\r\nis formed. the Greater part of our Security from the rains &c. is the\r\ngrass which is formed in a kind of ruff So as to turn the rain\r\nCompletely and is much the best tents we have. as the days are worm &c.\r\nwe have a bowry made to write under which we find not only comfortable\r\nbut necessary, to keep off the intence heet of the Sun which has great\r\neffect in this low bottom. on the high plains off the river the Climate\r\nis entirely different cool. Some Snow on the north hill Sides near the\r\ntop and vegetation near 3 weeks later than in the river bottoms. and\r\nthe rocky Mountains imedeately in view covered Several say 4 & 5 feet\r\ndeep with Snow. here I behold three different Climats within a fiew\r\nmiles a little before dark Hoh-hast-ill-pilt and the 3 old men & one\r\nother returned to our Camp and informed us the Canoe was a great way\r\noff and they could not cross this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 16, 1806]\r\nFriday May 16th 1806.\r\nDrewyer's horse left his camp last night and was brought to us this\r\nmorning by an indian who informed us he had found him a considerable\r\ndistance towards the mountains. Hohastillpilp and all the natives left\r\nus about noon and informed us that they were going up the river some\r\ndistance to a place at which they expected to fine a canoe, we gave\r\nthem the head and neck of a bear, a part of which they eat and took the\r\nballance with them. these people sometimes kill the variagated bear\r\nwhen they can get them in the open plain where they can pursue them on\r\nhorseback and shoot them with their arrows. the black bear they more\r\nfrequently kill as they are less ferocious. our sick men are much\r\nbetter today. Sahcargarmeah geathered a quantity of the roots of a\r\nspeceis of fennel which we found very agreeable food, the flavor of\r\nthis root is not unlike annis seed, and they dispell the wind which the\r\nroots called Cows and quawmash are apt to create particularly the\r\nlatter. we also boil a small onion which we find in great abundance,\r\nwith other roots and find them also an antidote to the effects of the\r\nothers. the mush of roots we find adds much to the comfort of our\r\ndiet.--we sent out several hunters this morning but they returned about\r\n11 A.M. without success; they killed a few pheasants only. at 5 P.M.\r\nDrewyer and Cruzatte returned having killed one deer only. Drewyer had\r\nwounded three bear which he said were as white as sheep but had\r\nobtained neither of them. they informed us that the hunting was but bad\r\nin the quarter they had been, the Country was broken and thickly\r\ncovered in most parts with underbrush. a little after dark Shannon and\r\nLabuish returned with one deer; they informed us that game was wild and\r\nscarce, that a large creek (Collins Creek) ran parallel with the river\r\nat the distance of about 5 or 6 miles which they found impracticable to\r\npass with their horses in consequence of the debth and rapidity of it's\r\ncurrent. beyond this creek the Indians inform us that there is great\r\nabundance of game. Sergt. Pryor and Collins who set out this morning on\r\na hunting excurtion did not return this evening.--I killed a snake near\r\nour camp, it is 3 feet 11 Inches in length, is much the colour of the\r\nrattlesnake common to the middle atlantic states, it has no poisonous\r\nteeth. it has 218 scutae on the abdomen and fifty nine squamae or half\r\nformed scutae on the tail. the eye is of moderate size, the iris of a\r\ndark yellowish brown and puple black. there is nothing remarkable in\r\nthe form of the head which is not so wide across the jaws as those of\r\nthe poisonous class of snakes usually are.--I preserved the skin of\r\nthis snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 16, 1806]\r\nFriday 16th May 1806\r\na cloudy morning with Some rain which continued untill Meridean at\r\nintervales, but very moderately. a man and boy Came to our Camp at 11\r\nA. M with Drewyers Horse which he informed us he found at a long\r\ndistance towards the Mtns. this horse must have Strayed from Drewyers\r\nCamp last night. Hohhastillpelt and all the nativs left us at merdn.\r\nand went up the river with a view to Cross at Some distance above where\r\nthey expected to find a Canoe.\r\n\r\nwe gave those people a head and Neck of the largest bear a part of\r\nwhich they eate and the balance they Carefully took with them for their\r\nchildren. The Indians of this Country Seldom kill the bear they are\r\nvery much afraid of them and the killing of a white or Grzley bear, is\r\nas great a feet as two of their enimy. the fiew of those Animals which\r\nthey Chance to kill is found in the leavel open lands and pursued on\r\nhorses & killed with their Arrows. they are fond of the flesh of this\r\nanimal and eate emoderately of it when they have a Sufficiency to\r\nindulge themselves. The men who were complaining of the head ake and\r\nCholicks yesterday and last night are much better to day. Shabonos\r\nSquar gatherd a quantity of fenel roots which we find very paleatiable\r\nand nurishing food. the Onion we also find in abundance and boil it\r\nwith our meat. Shields rode out and hunted in the morning without\r\nSuckcess he returned at 11 A.M. having killed only a black wood pecker\r\nwith a red breast as discribed hereafter. A snake which resembles the\r\nrattle Snake in colour and Spots on the Skin, longer and inosent. at 5\r\nP M Drewyer and Crusat returned haveing killed only one Deer only. D.\r\nShot 3 White bear but Could get neither of them. they inform us that\r\nthe hunting in the derection they were is very bad. the country hilly &\r\nbrushey. a little after dark Shannon & Labiech came in from the Chass.\r\nShannon killed one deer which he brought in. this deer being the only\r\nanimal they Could kill. they informed that a large Creek (Collens's\r\nCreek) run parrelal with the river at about 5 or 6 miles distant\r\nbetween which there was but little game, and the Creek being high rapid\r\nand the Smothe rocks in the bottom rendered it impossible for them to\r\npass it on hors back. Sergt. Pryor and Collins who Set out early this\r\nmorning hunting have not returned. we derected that the horses be drove\r\nup in future at 12 oClock on each day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 17, 1806]\r\nSaturday May 17th 1806.\r\nIt rained the greater part of the last night and this morning untill 8\r\nOCk. the water passed through flimzy covering and wet our bed most\r\nperfectly in shot we lay in the water all the latter part of the night.\r\nunfortunately my chronometer which for greater security I have woarn in\r\nmy fob for ten days past, got wet last night; it seemed a little\r\nextraordinary that every part of my breechies which were under my head,\r\nshould have escaped the moisture except the fob where the time peice\r\nwas. I opened it and founded it nearly filled with water which I\r\ncarefully drained out exposed it to the air and wiped the works as well\r\nas I could with dry feathers after which I touched them with a little\r\nbears oil. several parts of the iron and steel works were rusted a\r\nlittle which I wiped with all the care in my power. I set her to going\r\nand from her apparent motion hope she has sustained no material\r\ninjury.--at 9 A.M. Sergt. Pryor and Collins returned, Sergt. Pryor\r\nbrought the Skin and flesh of a black bear which he had killed; Collins\r\nhad also killed a very large variegated bear but his horse having\r\nabsconded last evening was unable to bring it. they had secured this\r\nmeat perfectly from the wolves or birds and as it was at a considerable\r\ndistance we did not think proper to send for it today. neither of these\r\nbear were in good order. as the bear are reather ferocious and we are\r\nobliged to depend on them pincipally for our subsistence we thought it\r\nmost advisable to direct at least two hunters to go together, and they\r\naccordingly peared themselves out for this purpose. we also apportioned\r\nthe horses to the several hunters in order that they should be equally\r\nrode and thereby prevent any horse being materially injured by being\r\ntoo constantly hunted. we appointed the men not hunters to take charge\r\nof certain horses in the absence of the hunters and directed the\r\nhunters to set out in different directions early in the morning and not\r\nreturn untill they had killed some game. it rained moderately the\r\ngreater part of the day and snowed as usual on the plain. Sergt. Pryor\r\ninformed me that it was shoe deep this morning when he came down. it is\r\nsomewhat astonishing that the grass and a variety of plants which are\r\nnow from a foot to 18 inches high on these plains sustain no injury\r\nfrom the snow or frost; many of those plants are in blume and appear to\r\nbe of a tender susceptable texture. we have been visited by no indians\r\ntoday, and occurrence which has not taken place before since we left\r\nthe Narrows of the Columbia.--I am pleased at finding the river rise so\r\nrapidly, it now doubt is attributeable to the meting snows of the\r\nmountains; that icy barier which seperates me from my friends and\r\nCountry, from all which makes life esteemable.--patience, patience\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 17, 1806]\r\nSaturday 17th May 1806\r\nrained moderately all the last night and this morning untill we are\r\nwet. The little river on which we are encamped rise Sepriseingly fast.\r\nat 9 A.M. Sergt. Pryor and Collins returned with the flesh and Skin of\r\na Black bear on Sgt. Pryors horse. Collins's horse haveing run off from\r\nhim yesterday. they informed us that they had each killed a Bear\r\nneither of which were fat. the one which they left in the woods was of\r\nthe white Species and very large we did not think it necessary in the\r\ncours of this day to Send for the flesh of the bear left in the woods.\r\nthe rains of the last night unfortunately wet the Crenomuter in the fob\r\nof Capt. L. breaches. which has never before been wet Since we Set out\r\non this expedition. her works were cautiously wiped and made dry by\r\nCapt. L. and I think She will recive no injury from this misfortune &c.\r\nwe arranged the hunters and horses to each hunter and directed them to\r\nturn out in the morning early and continue out untill they Killed\r\nSomething. others arranged so as to take care of the hunters horses in\r\ntheir absence. rained moderately all day. at the Same time Snowed on\r\nthe mountains which is in to the S. E. of us. no Indians visit us to\r\nday which is a Singular circumstance as we have not been one day\r\nwithout Indians Since we left the long narrows of the Columbia. the\r\nfiew worm days which we have had has melted the Snows in the Mountains\r\nand the river has rose considerably. that icy barier which Seperates me\r\nfrom my friends and Country, from all which makes life estimable, is\r\nyet white with the Snow which is maney feet deep. I frequently Consult\r\nthe nativs on the subject of passing this tremendious barier which now\r\npresent themselves to our view for great extent, they all appear to\r\nagree as to the time those Mountains may be passed which is about the\r\nMiddle of June.\r\n\r\nSergt. pryor informs me that the Snow on the high plains from the river\r\nwas Shoe deep this morning when he Came down. it is somewhat\r\nestonishing that the grass and a variety of Plants Sustain no injurey\r\nfrom the Snow or frost; Maney of those plants are in blume and appear\r\nto be of tender susceptable texture. At the distance of 18 Miles from\r\nthe river and on the Eastern border of the high Plain the Rocky\r\nMountain Commences and presents us with Winter here we have Summer,\r\nSpring and Winter in the Short Space of twenty or thirty miles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 18, 1806]\r\nSunday May 18th 1806.\r\nTwelve hunters turned out this morning in different directions\r\nagreeably to the order of last evening. Potts and Whitehouse\r\naccompanied Collins to the bear he had killed on the 16th inst. with\r\nwhich they returned in the afternoon. the colours of this bear was a\r\nmixture of light redish brown white and dark brown in which the bey or\r\nredish brown predominated, the fur was bey as well as the lower pertion\r\nof the long hairs, the white next succeeded in the long hairs which at\r\ntheir extremites were dark brown, this uncommon mixture might be termed\r\na bey grizzle.\r\n\r\nour indian woman was busily engaged today in laying in a store of the\r\nfennel roots for the Rocky mountains. these are called by the Shoshones\r\nyear-pah. at 2 P.M. 3 Indians who had been hunting towards the place at\r\nwhich we met with Chopunnish last fall, called by them the quawmash\r\ngrounds, called at our camp; they informed us that they had been\r\nhunting several days and had killed nothing; we gave them a small peice\r\nof meat which they told us they would reserve for their small children\r\nwho were very hungary; we smoked with them and they shortly after\r\ndeparted. early this morning the natives erected a lodge on the\r\nopposite side of the river near a fishing stand a little above us. no\r\ndoubt to be in readiness for the salmon, the arrival of which they are\r\nso ardently wishing as well as ourselves. this stand is a small stage\r\nare warf constructed of sticks and projecting about 10 feet into the\r\nriver and about 3 feet above the surface of the water on the extremity\r\nof this the fisherman stands with his scooping net, which differ but\r\nlittle in their form from those commonly used in our country it is\r\nformed thus. the fisherman exercised himself some hours today but I\r\nbelieve without success. at 3 P.M. J. Fields returned very unwell\r\nhaving killed nothing. shortly after an old man and woman arrived; the\r\nformer had soar eyes and the latter complained of a lax and rheumatic\r\neffections. we gave the woman some creem of tartar and flour of\r\nsulpher, and washed the old man's eyes with a little eyewater. a little\r\nbefore dark Drewyer R. Fields and LaPage returned having been also\r\nunsuccessfull they had killed a hawk only and taken the part of a\r\nsalmon from an Eagle, the latter altho it was of itself not valuable\r\nwas an agreeable sight as it gave us reason to hope that the salmon\r\nwould shortly be with us. these hunters had scowered the country\r\nbetween the Kooskooske and Collins's Creek from hence to their junction\r\nabout 10 miles and had seen no deer or bear and but little sign of\r\neither. shortly after dark it began to rain and continued raining\r\nmoderately all night. the air was extreemly cold and disagreeable and\r\nwe lay in the water as the preceeding night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 18, 1806]\r\nSunday 18th May 1806\r\nCloudy morning 12 hunters turned out this morning in different\r\ndirections agreeably to the order of yesterday. Potts and Whitehouse\r\naccompanied Collins to the bear which he had killed on the 16th and\r\nbrought in the flesh and Skin. this bear was not large but remarkably\r\nlight coloured the hair of it as also the hair of all those which has\r\nbeen killed is very thick and long. The Squar wife to Shabono busied\r\nher Self gathering the roots of the fenel Called by the Snake Indians\r\nYear-pah for the purpose of drying to eate on the Rocky mountains.\r\nthose roots are very paliatiable either fresh rosted boiled or dried\r\nand are generally between the Size of a quill and that of a mans fingar\r\nand about the length of the latter. at 2 P.M. 3 Indians who had been\r\nout hunting towards the place we met with the Chopunnish last fall,\r\nwhich place they Call the quarmash grounds. those men had been out\r\nSeveral days and killed nothing. we gave them a Small piece of meat\r\nwhich they told us they would reserve for their Small Children who was\r\nvery hungary. we Smoked with them and they departed. The nativs made a\r\nlodge on the opposit bank of the river a little above us at a fishing\r\nplace. as all communication is cut off between us and the nativs on the\r\nopposit Side of the river, we cannot Say by whome or for what service\r\nthat lodge has been errected as no one has been near it Since it was\r\nerrected this morning. at 3 P M Jo. Field returned from the chase\r\nwithout killing any thing he complains of being unwell. Son after an\r\nold man and a woman arived the man with Sore eyes, and the woman with a\r\ngripeing and rhumatic effections. I gave the woman a dose of creme of\r\ntarter and flour of Sulphur, and the man Some eye water. a little\r\nbefore night Rueben Field Drewyer and LaPage returned haveing killed\r\nnothing but a large hawk they had hunted in the point between the\r\nKooskooske and Collins's Creek and Saw but little Sign of either deer\r\nor Bear. the evening Cloudy, Soon after dark it began to rain and\r\nrained moderately all night-. LaPage took a Salmon from an Eagle at a\r\nShort distance below our Camp. this is induces us to believe that the\r\nSalmon is in this river and most probably will be here in great numbers\r\nin the Course of a fiew days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 19, 1806]\r\nMonday May 19th 1806.\r\nIt continued to rain this morning untill 8 OCk. when it became fair. We\r\nsent Charbono, Thompson, Potts, Hall and Wiser over the river to a\r\nvillage above in order to purchase some roots to eat with our lean bear\r\nmeat. for this purpose we gave them a few awls, Kniting pins and\r\nArmbands. we were informed that there was a canoe at the village in\r\nwhich they could pass the river. I sent Joseph and R. Feilds up the\r\nriver in surch of the horse which I rode over the Rocky mountains last\r\nfall. he had been seen yesterday with a parse) of indian horses and has\r\nbecome almost wild. at 11 A.M. Thompson returned from the village\r\naccompanied by a train of invalids consisting of 4 men 8 women and a\r\nchild. The men had soar eyes and the women in addition to soar eyes had\r\na variety of other complaints principally rheumatic; a weakness and\r\npain in the loins is a common complaint with their women. eyewater was\r\nadministered to all; to two of the women cathartics were given, to a\r\nthird who appeared much dejected and who from their account of her\r\ndisease we supposed it to be histerical, we gave 30 drops of Laudanum.\r\nthe several parts of the others where the rheumatic pains were seated\r\nwere well rubed with volitile linniment. all of those poor wretches\r\nthought themselves much benefited and all returned to their village\r\nwell satisfyed. at 5 P.M. or marketers returned with about 6 bushels of\r\nthe cows roots and a considerable quanty of bread of the same\r\nmaterials. late in the evening Reubin and Joseph Feilds returned with\r\nmy horse; we had him immediately castrated together with two others by\r\nDrewyer in the ordinary. we amused ourselves about an hour this\r\nafternoon in looking at the men running their horses. several of those\r\nhorses would be thought fleet in the U States. a little after dark\r\nSheilds and Gibson returned unsuccessful) from the chase. they had seen\r\nsome deer but no bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 19, 1806]\r\nMonday 19th May 1806\r\nRained this morning untill 8 oClock when it Cleared off and became\r\nfair-. we Sent Shabono, Thomson, Potts, Hall & Wizer over to the\r\nVillages above to purchase Some roots to eate with our pore bear meat,\r\nfor which purchase we gave them a fiew Awls, Knitting pins, & arm bans\r\nand directed them to proceed up on this Side of the river opposit to\r\nthe Village and Cross in the Cano which we are informed is at that\r\nplace. Sent Jo. & Reuben Field up the river a Short distance after the\r\nhorse which Capt. Lewis rode over the mountains last fall, which horse\r\nwas Seen yesterday with a gangue of Indian horses, and is Very wild-.\r\nabout 11 oClock 4 men and 8 Women Came to our Camp with Thompson who\r\nwent to the Village very early this morning. those Men applyed for Eye\r\nwater and the Women had a Variety of Complaints tho the most general\r\nComplaint was the Rhumitism, pains in the back and the Sore eyes, they\r\nalso brought fowd. a very young Child whome they Said had been very\r\nSick-. I administered eye water to all, two of the women I gave a\r\ncarthartic, one whose Spirets were very low and much hipedz I gave 30\r\ndrops of Lodomem, and to the others I had their backs hips legs thighs\r\n& arms well rubed with Volitile leniment all of those pore people\r\nthought themselves much benifited by what had been done for them, and\r\nat 3 P.M. they all returned to their Villages well satisfied. at 5 P.M.\r\nPotts, Shabono &c. returned from the Village with about 6 bushels of\r\nthe root the nativs Call Cowse and Some bread of the Same root. Rubin &\r\nJos. Fields returned with the horse Capt. Lewis rode across the rocky\r\nmountains we had this horse imedeately Cut with 2 others which we had\r\nnot before thought proper to Castrate. we amused ourselves about an\r\nhour this after noon looking at the men run their horses, Several of\r\nthem would be thought Swift horses in the atlantic States. a little\r\nafter dark John Shields and Gibson returned haveing killed nothing.\r\nthey Saw Some deer but Saw no bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 20, 1806]\r\nTuesday May 20th 1806.\r\nIt rained the greater part of last night and continued this morning\r\nuntill noon when it cleared away about an hour and then rained at\r\nintervals untill 4 in the evening. our covering is so indifferent that\r\nCapt C. and myself lay in the water the greater part of the last night.\r\nDrewyer, and the two Feildses set out on a hunting excurtion towards\r\nthe mountains. Shannon and Colter came in unsuccessfull, they had\r\nwounded a bear and a deer last evening but the night coming on they\r\nwere unable to pursue them, and the snow which fell in the course of\r\nthe night and this morning had covered the blood and rendered all\r\nfurther pursuit impracticable. at 2 P.M. Labuish arrived with a large\r\nbuck of the Mule deer speceis which he had killed on Collins's Creek\r\nyesterday. he had left Cruzatte and Collins on the Creek where they\r\nwere to wait his return. he informed us that it was snowing on the\r\nplain while it was raining at our camp in the river bottom. late in the\r\nevening Labuish and LaPage set out to join Collins and Cruzatte in\r\norder to resume their hunt early tomorrow morning. this evening a party\r\nof indians assembled on the opposite bank of the river and viewed our\r\ncamp with much attention for some time and retired.--at 5 P.M. Frazier\r\nwho had been permitted to go to the village this morning returned with\r\na pasel of Roots and bread which he had purchased. brass buttons is an\r\narticle of which these people are tolerably fond, the men have taken\r\nadvantage of their prepossession in favour of buttons and have devested\r\nthemselves of all they had in possesson which they have given in\r\nexchange for roots and bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 20, 1806]\r\nTuesday 20th May 1806\r\nrained the greater part of the last night and this morning untill\r\nmeridean when it Cleared away for an hour and began to rain and rained\r\nat entervals untill 4 P.M. our Covering was so indefferent that Capt\r\nLewis and my self was wet in our bed all the latter part of the night.\r\nDrewyer, Jos. & R. Fields Set out to towards the mountains. Shannon &\r\nColter Came in without any thing. they had Seen and Shot at a Bear and\r\na Deer neither of which they Could get. both of those Animals they must\r\nhave Wounded Mortally, but the night Comeing on prevented their\r\nfollowing them, and this morning the Snow had Covered the tracks and\r\nhid the blood and prevented their getting either of them.\r\n\r\nat 2 P.M. Labiech Came in with a large Buck of the Mule Deer Speces\r\nwhich he had killed on Collins's Creek yesterday. he left Collins and\r\nPeter Crusat on the Creek at which place they would Continue untill his\r\nreturn. he informd. us that it was Snowing on the leavel plains on the\r\ntop of the hill all the time it was raining in the bottom at our Camp.\r\nLabiech & Lapage returned to Collins & Crusat in the evening late for\r\nthe purpose of Pursueing the hunt in the Morning early. Several Indians\r\ncame to the opposit side of the River and viewed us some time. at 5 P M\r\nFrazur who had leave to go to the Village returned with Some roots\r\nwhich he had purchased. cloudy &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 21, 1806]\r\nWednesday May 21st 1806.\r\nIt rained a few hours this morning. Sheilds and Gibson set out to hunt\r\ntowards the mountains. Collins came to camp at noon and remained about\r\n2 hours; he has killed nothing since he left us last. we set five men\r\nat work to make a canoe for the purpose of fishing and passing the\r\nriver. the Indians have already promised us a horse for this canoe when\r\nwe have no longer any uce for her. as our tent was not sufficient to\r\nshelter us from the rain we had a lodge constructed of willow poles and\r\ngrass in the form of the orning of a waggon closed at one end. this we\r\nhad made sufficiently large to sleep in and to shelter the most\r\nimportant part of our baggage. it is perfectly secure against the rain\r\nsun and wind and affords us much the most comfortable shelter we have\r\nhad since we left Fort Clatsop. today we divided the remnant of our\r\nstore of merchandize among our party with a view that each should\r\npurchase therewith a parsel of roots and bread from the natives as his\r\nstores for the rocky mountains for there seems but little probability\r\nthat we shall be enabled to make any dryed meat for that purpose and we\r\ncannot as yet form any just idea what resource the fish will furnish\r\nus. each man's stock in trade amounts to no more than one awl, one\r\nKniting pin, a half an ounce of vermillion, two nedles, a few scanes of\r\nthead and about a yard of ribbon; a slender stock indeed with which to\r\nlay in a store of provision for that dreary wilderness. we would make\r\nthe men collect these roots themselves but there are several speceis of\r\nhemlock which are so much like the cows that it is difficult to\r\ndiscriminate them from the cows and we are affraid that they might\r\npoison themselves. the indians have given us another horse to kill for\r\nprovision which we keep as a reserved store. our dependence for\r\nsubsistence is on our guns, the fish we may perhaps take, the roots we\r\ncan purchase from the natives and as the last alternative our horses.\r\nwe eat the last morsel of meat which we had for dinner this evening,\r\nyet nobody seems much conserned about the state of provision. Willard,\r\nSergt. Ordway and Goodrich were permitted to visit the village today;\r\nthe former returned in the evening with some roots and bread, the two\r\nlast remaining all night. one of our party brought in a young sandhill\r\ncrain it was about the size of a pateridge and of a redish brown\r\ncolour, it appeared to be about 5 or six days old; these crains are\r\nabundant in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 21, 1806]\r\nWednesday 21st May 1806\r\nrained this morning. Shields and Gibson Set out to hunt towards the\r\nmountains. Collins Came in to day and Stayed in about two hours, he has\r\nkilled nothing Since he went out last. we Set 5 Men at work to build a\r\nCanoe for the purpose of takeing fish and passing the river and for\r\nwhich we can get a good horse. as our tent is not Sufficient to keep\r\noff the rain we are Compelled to have Some other resort for a Security\r\nfrom the repeeted Showers which fall. we have a small half circular\r\nplace made and Covered with grass which makes a very Secure Shelter for\r\nus to Sleep under. We devided our Store of merchindize amongst our\r\nparty for the purpose of precureing Some roots &c. of the nativs to\r\neach mans part amounted to about an awl Knitting pin a little paint and\r\nSome thread & 2 Needles which is but a Scanty dependance for roots to\r\ntake us over those Great Snowey Barriers (rocky mountains) which is and\r\nwill be the Cause of our Detention in this neighbourhood probably\r\nuntill the 10 or 15 of June. they are at this time Covered deep with\r\nSnow. the plains on the high Country above us is also covered with\r\nSnow. Serjt. Ordway, Goodrich, & Willard went to the village to day to\r\nprecure a fiew roots. we eate the last of our meat for Dinner to day,\r\nand our only Certain dependance is the roots we Can precure from the\r\nnativs for the fiew articles we have left those roots with what Game we\r\nCan precure from the wods will probably last us untill the arival of\r\nthe Salmon. if they Should not; we have a horse in Store ready to be\r\nkilled which the indians have offered to us. Willard returned from the\r\nVillage. Sergt. Ordway and Goodrich Continued all night. one of the men\r\nbrought me a young Sandhill Crain which was about 5 or 6 days old it\r\nwas of a yellowish brown Colour, about the Size of a partridge. Those\r\nCrains are very abundant in every part of this country in pars of two,\r\nand Sometimes three together.\r\n\r\nthe party had gathered roots with leaves still attached they probably\r\ncould have been sorted with Indian assistance. However, the parsley\r\nfamily (Apiaceae) is one of the most diverse and confusing plant\r\nfamilies in the region, and Lewis could not be sure that the men would\r\nnot bring back some other poisonous species not well known to the\r\nIndians. The decision to purchase roots was probably prudent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 22, 1806]\r\nThursday May 22ed 1806.\r\nA fine morning we exposed all our baggage to air and dry as well as our\r\nstore of roots and bread purchased from the natives. permited Windsor\r\nand McNeal to go to the indian village. Sergt. Ordway and Goodrich\r\nreturned this morning with a good store of roots and bread. about noon\r\n2 indian men came down the river on a raft and continued at our camp\r\nabout 3 hours and returned to their village. we.sent out Shannon and\r\nColter to hunt towards the mountains. we sent Sergt. Pryor down to the\r\nentrance of Collins's Creek to examine the country and look out for a\r\ngood position for an encampment on the river below that Creek, having\r\ndetermined to remove our camp below that crek if it continues high, as\r\nsoon as we have completed our canoe, as the country to which we are\r\nconfined to hunt at present is limited by this creek and river to a\r\nvery narrow tract, and game have already become scarce. if we can\r\nobtain a good situation below the entrance of this creek it will be\r\nmuch more eligible as the hunting country is more extensive and game\r\nmore abundant than above. The horse which the indians have given us to\r\nkill was driven away yesterday by the natives with a gang of their\r\nhorses I presume in mistake; being without meat at noon we directed one\r\nof the largest of our colts to be killed. we found the flesh of this\r\nanimal fat tender and by no means illy flavoured. we have three others\r\nwhich we mean to reserve for the rocky mountains if we can subsist here\r\nwithout them. my horse which was castrated the day before yesterday\r\nwounded his thigh on the inner side with the rope by which he was\r\nconfined that evening and is now so much swolen with the wound the\r\ncastraiting and the collection of vermen that he cannot walk, in short\r\nhe is the most wretched specticle; I had his wounds clensed of the\r\nvermen by washing them well with a strong decoction of the bark of the\r\nroots & leaves of elder but think the chances are against his recovery.\r\nat 3 P.M. we observed a large party of Indians on horseback in pursuit\r\nof a deer which they ran into the river opposite to our camp; Capt. C.\r\nMyself & three of our men shot and killed the deer in the water; the\r\nindians pursued it on a raft and caught it. it is astonishing to see\r\nthese people ride down those steep hills which they do at full speed.\r\non our return to camp we found Drewyer the Two Feildses Gibson and\r\nSheilds just arrived with five deer which they had killed at a\r\nconsiderable distance towards the mountains. they also brought with\r\nthem two red salmon trout which they had purchased from some indians\r\nwhom they had met with on their return to camp.--Two Indians who were\r\njust arrived at our camp informed us that these salmon trout remained\r\nin this river the greater part of the winter, that they were not good\r\nat this season which we readily discovered, they were very meagre.\r\nthese indians also informed us that there were at this time a great\r\nnumber of salmon at no great distance from hence in Lewis's river which\r\nhad just arrived and were very fat and fine, they said it would be some\r\nyet before they would ascend this river as high as this place. a party\r\nof the natives on the opposite shore informed those with us that a\r\nparty of the Shoshones had two nights past surrounded a lodge of their\r\nnation on the South side of Lewis's river, that the inhabitants having\r\ntimely discovered the enimy effected their retreat in the course of the\r\nnight and escaped. Charbono's Child is very ill this evening; he is\r\ncuting teeth, and for several days past has had a violent lax, which\r\nhaving suddonly stoped he was attacked with a high fever and his neck\r\nand throat are much swolen this evening. we gave him a doze of creem of\r\ntartar and flour of sulpher and applyed a poltice of boiled onions to\r\nhis neck as warm as he could well bear it. Sergt. Pryor returned late\r\nin the evening and informed us that he had been down the river eight\r\nmiles and that the clifts set in so abruptly to the river he could get\r\nno further without returning several miles back and ascending the hills\r\nand that he had thought it best to return and ride down tomorrow on the\r\nhigh plain as he believed the mouth of the creek was a considerable\r\ndistance. Drewyer who has been at the place informs us that it is about\r\n10 ms. and that there is no situation on the river for some distance\r\nbelow this creek which can possibly answer our purposes.--we dryed our\r\nbaggage &c perfectly and put it up.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 22, 1806]\r\nThursday 22nd May 1806\r\na fine day we exposed all our baggage to the Sun to air and dry, also\r\nour roots which we have precured of the nativs. gave promission to\r\nWindser & McNeal to go to the Indian Villages. Sergt. Ordway and\r\ngoodrich returned at 11 A.M. Soon after 2 Indian men Came down on a\r\nraft and Continued with us about 3 hours and then returned to their\r\nVillage. Shannon & Colter went out to day to hunt towards the\r\nmountains. Sergt. Pryor went out to hunt down the river, and examine\r\nthe mouth of Collins Creek, if a good Situation was below that Creek\r\nfor a Camp. this Creek which Cannot be passed owing to it's debth &\r\nrapidity is a great beariore in our way to the best hunting Country. it\r\nconfines us to a narrow scope between this Creek and the river on which\r\nwe are Camped. If a Situation can be found imedeately below the Creek\r\nit will answer us better than our present one as from thence we Can get\r\nout to Some distance to hunt, and be convenient also to the fish Should\r\nthey pass up &c. The horse the Indian's left with us to kill has been\r\ndrove to their village with a gang of horses which I suppose belonged\r\nto another man. as the greater part of our men have not had any Meat to\r\neate for 2 days, and the roots they Complain of, not being accustiomed\r\nto live on them altogether we derected a large Coalt which was given to\r\nus by a young man with an elegant mare on the ____ instant. this Coalt\r\nwas fat and was handsom looking meat. late in the evening we were\r\ninformed that the horse which Capt L. rode over the rocky mountains and\r\nwhich was Cut day before yesterday had his hip out of place Since that\r\ntime, and Could not walk. Capt. Lewis examined him and thought he Could\r\nnot recover. at 3 P.M. we observed a number of Indians in chase of a\r\ndeer on their horses on the opposit hill Sides. Soon after the deer\r\ntook the water I Capt L. and 3 men run down on this Side, and killed\r\nthe deer in the water, the deer floated down and the Indians took it by\r\nmeans of a raft which they had ready. on my return to Camp found\r\nDrewyer Jos. & Reuben Fields, Shields and gibson just arrived from the\r\nChass with 5 Deer which they had killed on the high lands toward the\r\nmountains. they also brought with them two Salmon trout which they had\r\npurchased of Indians which they Saw on their return to Camp. at 5 p. M.\r\ntwo young men highly decurated in their way Came to our camp and\r\ninformed us that the fat fish were in great numbers in Lewis's river.\r\nthat those Salmon trout which our hunters brought were pore and Such as\r\nwere Cought in the Winter in this river and were not the kind which\r\nComes up in the Spring of the year. great number of Indians Come to the\r\nopposit bank and inform those on this Side that the Snake Indians had\r\ncome to a Lodge on Lewis's river at night. the inhabitents previously\r\ndiscovering them abandened the house. Shabonoes Son a Small child is,\r\ndangerously ill. his jaw and throat is much Swelled. we apply a poltice\r\nof Onions. after giveing him Some creem of tarter &c. this day proved\r\nto be fine fair which afforded us an oppertunety of drying our baggage\r\nwhich had got a little wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 23, 1806]\r\nFriday May 23rd 1806.\r\nSergt. Pryor wounded a deer early this morning in a lick near camp; my\r\ndog pursud it into the river; the two young Indian men who had remained\r\nwith us all night mounted their horses swam the river and drove the\r\ndeer into the water again; Sergt. Pryor killed it as it reached the\r\nshore on this side, the indians returned as they had passed over. we\r\ndirected half this deer to be given to the indians, they immediately\r\nmade a fire and cooked their meat, 4 others joined them from the\r\nvillage with the assistance of whom they consumed their portion of the\r\nspoil in less than 2 hours and took their leave of our camp. The Creem\r\nof tartar and sulpher operated several times on the child in the course\r\nof the last night, he is considerably better this morning, tho the\r\nswelling of the neck has abated but little; we still apply polices of\r\nonions which we renew frequently in the course of the day and night. at\r\nnoon we were visited by 4 indians who informed us they cad come from\r\ntheir village on Lewis's river at the distance of two days ride in\r\norder to see us and obtain a little eyewater, Capt. C. washed their\r\neyes and they set out on their return to their village. our skill as\r\nphisicans and the virture of our medecines have been spread it seems to\r\na great distance. I sincerely wish it was in our power to give releif\r\nto these poor afficted wretches. at 1 P.M. Shannon, Colter, Labuish,\r\nCruzatte, Collins, and LaPage returned from hunting without having\r\nkilled anything except a few pheasants of the dark brown kind, which\r\nthey brought with them.These hunters informed us that they had hunted\r\nthe country deligently between the river and Creek for some distance\r\nabove and below our camp and that there was no game to be found. all\r\nthe horses which have been castrated except my poor unfortunate horse\r\nappear as if they would do very well. I am convinced that those cut by\r\nthe indians will get well much soonest and they do not swell nor appear\r\nto suffer as much as those cut in the common way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 23, 1806]\r\nFriday 23rd May 1806\r\na fair morning. Sergt. Pryor wounded a Deer at a lick near our Camp and\r\nour dog prosued it into the river. two Indians which happened to be at\r\nour Camp Mounted their horses and Swam across the river chased the deer\r\ninto the water again and pursued it across to the Side on which we\r\nwere, and as the Deer Came out of the Water Sgt. Pryor killed it. we\r\nderected half of this deer to be given to those two indians. they\r\nimediately made a fire and Cooked the meat. 4 others joined them from\r\nthe Village and they Soon consumed their portion. The Child is\r\nSomething better this morning than it was last night. we apply a fresh\r\npoltice of the wild Onion which we repeeted twice in the Course of the\r\nday. the Swelling does not appear to increas any Since yesterday. The 4\r\nIndians who visited us to day informed us that they Came from their\r\nvillage on Lewis's river two days ride from this place for the purpose\r\nof Seeing of us and getting a little eye water I washed their eyes with\r\nSome eyewater and they all left us at 2 P.M. and returned to the\r\nVillages on the opposit Side of this river. at 1 oClock Shannon,\r\nColter, Labiech, Crusatt Lapage and Collins all returned from hunting\r\nwithout haveing killed any thing except a fiew heath hens & black\r\nPheasants two of which they brought with them. Labiech also brought a\r\nwhisteling squerel which he had killed on it's hole in the high plains.\r\nthis squerel differs from those on the Missouri in their Colour, Size,\r\nfood and the length tal and from those found near the falls of Columbia\r\n\r\nOur hunters brought us a large hooting owl which differ from those of\r\nthe atlantic States. The plumage of this owl is an uniform mixture of\r\ndark yellowish brown and white, in which the dark brown prodominates.\r\nit's Colour may be properly termed a dark Iron gray. the plumage is\r\nvery long and remarkably Silky and Soft. those have not the long\r\nfeathers on the head which give it the appearance of ears, or horns,\r\nremarkable large eyes\r\n\r\nthe hunters informed us that they had hunted with great industry all\r\nthe Country between the river and for Some distance above and below\r\nwithout the Smallest Chance of killing any game. they inform us that\r\nthe high lands are very cold with snow which has fallen for every day\r\nor night for Several past. our horses which was Cut is like to doe well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 24, 1806]\r\nSaturday May 24th 1806.\r\nThe child was very wrestless last night; it's jaw and the back of it's\r\nneck are much more swolen than they were yesterday tho his fever has\r\nabated considerably. we gave it a doze of creem of tartar and applyed a\r\nfresh poltice of onions. we ordered some of the hunters out this\r\nmorning and directed them to pass Collins's creek if possible and hunt\r\ntowards the quawmash feilds. William Bratton still continues very\r\nunwell; he eats heartily digests his food well, and his recovered his\r\nflesh almost perfectly yet is so weak in the loins that he is scarcely\r\nable to walk nor can he set upwright but with the greatest pain. we\r\nhave tryed every remidy which our engenuity could devise, or with which\r\nour stock of medicines furnished us, without effect. John Sheilds\r\nobserved that he had seen men in a similar situation restored by\r\nviolent sweats. Bratton requested that he might be sweated in the\r\nmanner proposed by Sheilds to which we consented. Sheilds sunk a\r\ncircular hole of 3 feet diamiter and four feet deep in the earth. he\r\nkindled a large fire in the hole and heated well, after which the fire\r\nwas taken out a seat placed in the center of the hole for the patient\r\nwith a board at bottom for his feet to rest on; some hoops of willow\r\npoles were bent in an arch crossing each other over the hole, on these\r\nseveral blankets were thrown forming a secure and thick orning of about\r\n3 feet high. the patient being striped naked was seated under this\r\norning in the hole and the blankets well secured on every side. the\r\npatient was furnished with a vessell of water which he sprinkles on the\r\nbottom and sides of the hole and by that means creates as much steam or\r\nvapor as he could possibly bear, in this situation he was kept about 20\r\nminutes after which he was taken out and suddonly plunged in cold water\r\ntwise and was then immediately returned to the sweat hole where he was\r\ncontinued three quarters of an hour longer then taken out covered up in\r\nseveral blankets and suffered to cool gradually. during the time of his\r\nbeing in the sweat hole, he drank copious draughts of a strong tea of\r\nhorse mint. Sheilds says that he had previously seen the tea of\r\nSinnecca snake root used in stead of the mint which was now employed\r\nfor the want of the other which is not be found in this country.--this\r\nexperiment was made yesterday; Bratton feels himself much better and is\r\nwalking about today and says he is nearly free from pain.--at 11 A.M. a\r\ncanoe arrived with 3 of the natives one of them the sick man of whom I\r\nhave before made mentions as having lost the power of his limbs. he is\r\na cheif of considerable note among them and they seem extreemly anxious\r\nfor his recovery. as he complains of no pain in any particular part we\r\nconceive it cannot be the rheumatism, nor do we suppose that it can be\r\na parelitic attack or his limbs would have been more deminished. we\r\nhave supposed that it was some disorder which owed it's origine to a\r\ndiet of particular roots perhaps and such as we have never before\r\nwitnessed. while at the village of the broken arm we had recommended a\r\ndiet of fish or flesh for this man and the cold bath every morning. we\r\nhad also given him a few dozes of creem of tarter and flour of sulpher\r\nto be repeated every 3rd day. this poor wretch thinks that he feels\r\nhimself of somewhat better but to me there appears to be no visible\r\nalteration. we are at a loss what to do for this unfortunate man. we\r\ngave him a few drops of Laudanum and a little portable soup. 4 of our\r\nparty pased the river and visited the lodge of the broken Arm for the\r\npurpose of traiding some awls which they had made of the links of small\r\nchain belonging to one of their steel traps, for some roots. they\r\nreturned in the evening having been very successfull, they had obtained\r\na good supply of roots and bread of cows.--this day has proved warmer\r\nthan any of the preceeding since we have arrived here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 24, 1806]\r\nSaturday 24th May 1806\r\na fine morning the Child was very restless last night its jaw and back\r\nof its neck is much more Swelled than it was yesterday. I gave it a\r\ndost of Creme of Tarter and a fresh Poltice of Onions. ordered Shields,\r\nGibson, Drewyer, Crusat, Collins, and Jo. & rubin Fields to turn out\r\nhunting and if possible Cross Collins Creek and hunt towards the quar\r\nmash fields. W. Brattin is yet very low he eats hartily but he is So\r\nweak in the Small of his back that he Can't walk. we have made use of\r\nevery remidy to restore him without it's haveing the desired effect.\r\none of our party, John Shields observed that he had Seen men in Similar\r\nSituations restored by Violent Swets. and bratten requested that he\r\nmight be Swetted in the way Sheilds purposed which we agreed to.\r\nShields dug a round hole 4 feet deep & 3 feet Diamuter in which he made\r\na large fire So as to beet the hole after which the fire was taken out\r\na Seet placed in the hole. the patent was then Set on the Seat with a\r\nboard under his feet and a can of water handed him to throw on the\r\nbottom & Sides of the hole So as to create as greate a heat as he Could\r\nbear. and the hole covered with blankets supported by hoops. after\r\nabout 20 minits the patient was taken out and put in Cold water a few\r\nminits, & returned to the hole in which he was kept about 1 hour. then\r\ntaken out and Covered with Several blankets, which was taken off by\r\ndegrees untill he became Cool. this remedy took place yesterday and\r\nbratten is walking about to day and is much better than he has been. at\r\n11 A.M. a canoe came down with the Indian man who had applyed for\r\nmedical assistance while we lay at the broken arms village. this man I\r\nhad given a fiew doses of Flower of Sulpher & Creme of Tarter and\r\nderected that he Should take the Cold bath every morning. he Conceited\r\nhimself a little better than he was at that time. he had lost the use\r\nof all his limbs and his fingers are Contracted. We are at a loss to\r\ndeturmine what to do for this unfortunate man. I gave him a few drops\r\nof Lodman and Some portable Supe as medisine. 4 of our men Crossed the\r\nriver and went to the broken arms Village and returned in the evening\r\nwith a Supply of bread and roots which they precured in exchange for\r\nAwls which were made of pieces of a chane--we were visited to day by\r\nthe 2 young men who gave Capt. L. and my Self a horse each at the\r\nvillage. those men Stayed about two hours and returned to their\r\nvillage. this day proved to be very worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 25, 1806]\r\nSunday May 25th 1806.\r\nIt rained the greater part of last night and continued untill 6 A.M.\r\nour grass tent is impervious to the rain. the Child is more unwell than\r\nyesterday. we gave it a doze of creem of tartar which did not operate,\r\nwe therefore gave it a clyster in the evening. we caused a sweat to be\r\nprepared for the indian Cheif in the same manner in which Bratton had\r\nbeen sweated, this we attempted but were unable to succeed, as he was\r\nunable to set up or be supported in the place. we informed the indians\r\nthat we knew of no releif for him except sweating him in their sweat\r\nhouses and giving him a plenty of the tea of the horsemint which we\r\nshewed them. and that this would probably nos succeed as he had been so\r\nlong in his present situation. I am confident that this would be an\r\nexcellent subject for electricity and much regret that I have it not in\r\nmy power to supply it.--Drewyer Labuish and Cruzatte set out this\r\nmorning to hunt towards the quawmash grounds if they can possibly pass\r\nCollins's Creek. Joseph and Reuben Feilds passed the river in order to\r\nhunt on the opposite side some miles above where the natives inform us\r\nthat there is an abundance of bear and some deer. Goodrich visited a\r\nvillage about 8 ms. above on the opposite side of the river and\r\nreturned in the evening; he procured but few roots, he informed us that\r\nthere were but 8 persons at home; the others were either hunting,\r\ndiging roots or fishing on Lewis's river. he saw several salmon in\r\ntheir lodges which they informed him came from that river these fish\r\nwere remarkably fat and fine. Gibson and shields returned this evening\r\nhaving killed a Sandhill Crain only. they had wounded a female bear and\r\na deer but got neither of them. Gibson informed me that the bear had\r\ntwo cubbs one of which was white and other as black as jett. four\r\nindians remained with us this evening.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 25, 1806]\r\nSunday 25th May 1806\r\nrained moderately the greater part of last night and this morning\r\nuntill 6 A.M. The child is not So well to day as yesterday. I repeeted\r\nthe Creem of tarter and the onion poltice. I caused a Swet to be\r\nprepared for the Indn. in the Same hole which bratten had been Sweeten\r\nin two days past Drewyer Labiech and Peter crusatt Set out hunting\r\ntowards the quarmash grounds if they can cross the Creek which is\r\nbetween this and that place, which has been the bearrer as yet to our\r\nhunters. Jos. & R Fields crossed the river to hunt on the opposit side.\r\nGoodrich went to the 2d village to purchase roots a fiew of which he\r\nprecured. he informed us that only 8 persons remained in the Village.\r\nthe men were either hunting on Lewis's river fishing, & the women out\r\ndigging roots. he saw Several fresh Salmon which the nativs informed\r\nhim Came from Lewis's river and were fat and fine. one of our men\r\npurchased a Bear Skin of the nativs which was nearly of a Cream\r\nColoured white. this Skin which was the Skin of an animal of the middle\r\nSize of bears together with the defferent Sizes colours &c. of those\r\nwhich have been killed by our hunters give me a Stronger evidence of\r\nthe various Coloured bear of this country being one Species only, than\r\nany I have heretofore had. the poil of these bear were infinately\r\nlonger finer & thicker than the black bear their tallons also longer &\r\nmore blunt as worn by digging roots. the white redish brown and bey\r\nColoured bear I saw together on the Missouri; the bey & Grizly have\r\nbeen Seen and killed together here. for these were the Colours of those\r\nwhich Collins killed on the 14th inst. in short it is not common to\r\nfind two bear here of this Species presisely of the same colour, and if\r\nwe were to attempt to distinguish them by their colours and to\r\ndenomonate each colour a distinct Species we Should Soon find at least\r\ntwenty. the most Strikeing difference between this Species of bear and\r\nthe Common black bear are that the former are large and have longer\r\ntallens, hair, and tushes, prey more on other animals, do not lie so\r\nlong or so closely in winter quarters, and will not Climb a tree, tho\r\never so hardly pursued. the varigated bear I believe to be the Same\r\nhere with those of the Missouri but these are not so ferocious as those\r\non the Missouri perhaps from the Circumstance of their being compeled\r\nfrom the scercity of game in this quarter to live more on roots and of\r\ncourse not so much in the habit of Seizing and debowering liveing\r\nanimals. the bear here is far from being as passive as the common black\r\nbear, they have atacked and fought our hunters already but not so\r\nfeircely as those of the Missouri. There are also some of the Common\r\nblack bear in this neghbourhood tho no So Common as the other Species.\r\n\r\nwe attempted to swet the sick indian but could not Suckceed. he was not\r\nable either to Set up or be Supported in the place prepared for him. I\r\ntherefore deturmined to inform the Nativs that nothing but Sefere\r\nSwetts would restore this disabled man, and even that doubtfull in his\r\npresent Situation. in the evening Shields & gibson returned haveing\r\nkilled a Sandhill Crane only. they Saw a female bear, & 2 Cubs &\r\nSeveral deer. they Shot the bear and a deer both of which made their\r\nescape. Gibson told me that the Cubs were of different Colours one jut\r\nblack and the other of a whiteish Colour-. 4 indians Continue with us,\r\none return to their village to daey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 26, 1806]\r\nMonday May 26th 1806.\r\nHad frequent showers in the course of the last night. Collins, Shannon\r\nand Colter set out to hunt on the high lands some distance up on the N.\r\nE. side of Collins's Creek. The Clyster given the Child last evening\r\noperated very well. it is clear of fever this evening and is much\r\nbetter, the swelling is considerably abated and appears as if it would\r\npass off without coming to a head. we still continue fresh poltices of\r\nonions to the swolen part. we directed the indians in what manner to\r\ntreat the dieased Cheif, gave him a few dozes of flour of sulpher and\r\nCreem of tartar & some portable soupe and directed them to take him\r\nhome. they seemed unwilling to comply with the latter part of the\r\ninjunction for they consumed the day and remained with us all night. at\r\n1 P.M. Joseph and R. Feilds returned, accompanyed by Hohastillpilp\r\nseveral other inferior Cheifs and some young men. These hunters\r\ninformed us they were unable to reach the grounds to which they had\r\nbeen directed in consequence of the debth and rapidity of a large creek\r\nwhich falls in about 10 Ms. above. they passed Commearp Creek at about\r\n11/2 Ms. and a second creek reather larger at 3 Ms. further. at the\r\ndistance of 4 Ms. up this last creek on their return they called at a\r\nvillage which our traders have never yet visited, here they obtained a\r\nlarge quantity of bread and roots of Cows on very moderate terms. we\r\npermitted Sergt. Pryor and four men to pass the river tomorrow morning\r\nwith a view to visit this village we also directed Charbono York and\r\nLePage to set out early for the same place and procure us some roots.\r\nour meat is again exhausted, we therefore directed R. Fields to hunt\r\nthe horse in the morning which the Indians have given us to kill. one\r\nof our men saw a salmon in the river today. in the afternoon we\r\ncompleated our canoe and put her in the water; she appears to answer\r\nvery well and will carry about 12 persons.--the river still rising fast\r\nand snows of the mountains visibly diminish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 26, 1806]\r\nMonday 26th May 1806\r\nSome Small Showers of rain last night, and continued Cloudy this\r\nmorning untill 7 A.

The Child Something better this morning\r\ntho the Swelling yet continues. we Still apply the onion poltice. I\r\ndetected what Should be done for the disabled man, gave him a fiew\r\ndoses of Creem of tarter & flour Sulphur, and Some portable Supe and\r\ndirected that he Should be taken home & Swetted &c. at 1 P.M. Joseph &\r\nR. Fields returned accompanied by Hoh hast ill pilt and an Second Chief\r\nand 4 men Several young men also rode down on this Side. Jo & R Fields\r\ninformed us that they were at a village 4 Miles up the 2nd Creek from\r\nthis place on the opposit side above at which place on the opposit side\r\nabove at which place they precured roots on very reasonable terms. they\r\nCould not proceed higher up to hunt as the creeks were too high for\r\nthem to Cross, &c. we gave permission to Serjt. Pryor and 4 men to\r\ncross the river and trade with nativs of the village the Field's were\r\nat yesterday for roots &c. we also directed Shabono & york to proceed\r\non to the Same Village and precure Some roots for our Selves if\r\npossible. one of our men Saw a Salmon in the river to day. and two\r\nothers eat of Salmon at the near Village which was brought from Lewis's\r\nriver. our Canoe finished and put into the water. it will Carry 12 men.\r\nthe riseing very fast and Snow appear to melt on the Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 27, 1806]\r\nTuesday May 27th 1806.\r\nEarly this morning we sent Reubin Fields in surch of the horse which\r\nthe indians had given us to kill. at 10 in the morning he returned with\r\nthe horse and we killed and butchered him; he was large and in good\r\norder. Hohastillpilp told us that most of the horses we saw runing at\r\nlarge in this neighbourhood belonged to himself and his people, and\r\nwhenever we were in want of meat he requested that we would kill any of\r\nthem we wished; this is a peice of liberallity which would do honour to\r\nsuch as host of civilization; indeed I doubt whether there are not a\r\ngreat number of our countrymen who would see us fast many days before\r\ntheir compassion would excite them to a similar act of liberallity.\r\nSergt. Pryor and the party ordered to the indian Village set out early\r\nthis morning. in the evening he returned with Gibson and Sheilds. the\r\nothers remained at the village all night; they brought a good store of\r\nroots and bread. we also sent Sergt. ordway and 2 men this morning over\r\nto Lewis's river for salmon, which the indians inform us may be\r\nprocured in abundance at that place, and that it is but half a days\r\nride, nearly south.--Drewyer, Cruzatte, and Labuish returned at 4 P.M.\r\nwith five deer which they had killed at some distance up Collins's\r\nCreek on this side; that stream still continues so high that they could\r\nnot pass it.--Charbono's son is much better today, tho the swelling on\r\nthe side of his neck I beleive will terminate in an ugly imposthume a\r\nlittle below the ear. the indians were so anxious that the sick Cheif\r\nshould be sweated under our inspection that they requested we would\r\nmake a second attept today; accordingly the hole was somewhat enlarged\r\nand his father a very good looking old man, went into the hole with him\r\nand sustained him in a proper position during the operation; we could\r\nnot make him sweat as copiously as we wished. after the operation he\r\ncomplained of considerable pain, we gave him 30 drops of laudanum which\r\nsoon composed him and he rested very well.--this is at least a strong\r\nmark of parental affection. they all appear extreemly attentive to this\r\nsick man nor do they appear to relax in their asceduity towards him\r\nnotwithstand he has been sick and helpless upwards of three years. the\r\nChopunnish appear to be very attentive and kind to their aged people\r\nand treat their women with more rispect than the nations of the\r\nMissouri.--There is a speceis of Burrowing squirrel common in these\r\nplains which in their habits somewhat resemble those of the missouri\r\nbut are a distinct speceis. this little animal measures one fot five\r\nand 1/2 inches from the nose to the extremity of the tail, of which the\r\ntail occupys 21/4 inches only; in the girth it is 11 In. the body is\r\nproportionably long, the neck and legs short; the ears are short,\r\nobtusely pointed, and lie close to the head; the aperture of the ear is\r\nlarger proportionably than most animals which burrow. the eyes are of\r\nmoderate size, the puple black and iris of a dark sooty brown. the\r\nteeth are like those of the squirrel as is it's whole contour. the\r\nwhiskers are full, long and black; it also has some long black hairs\r\nabove the eyes. it has five toes on each foot; the two inner toes of\r\nthe fore feet are remarkably short, and have short blont nails. the\r\nremaining toes on those feet are long, black, slightly curved, and\r\nsharply pointed. the outer and inner toes of the hind feet are not\r\nshort yet they are by no means as long as the three toes in the center\r\nof the foot which are remarkably long but the nails are not as long as\r\nthose of the fore feet tho of the same form and colour. the hair of the\r\ntail tho of the same form and colour. the hair of the tail tho thickly\r\ninserted on every part rispects the two sides only. this gives it a\r\nflat appearance and a long ovol form. the tips of the hair which form\r\nthe outer edges of the tail are white. the base of the hairs are either\r\nblack or a fox red. the under disk of the tail is an iron grey, the\r\nupper a redish brown. the lower part of the jaws, under part of the\r\nneck, legs and feet from the body down and belley are of a light brick\r\nred. the nose as high as the eyes is of a darker brick red. the upper\r\npart of the head neck and body are of a curious brownish grey colour\r\nwith a cast of the brick red. the longer hair of these parts being of a\r\nredish white colour at their extremities, fall together in such manner\r\nas to give it the appearance of being speckled at a little distance.\r\nthese animals form large ascociations as those of the Missouri,\r\noccupying with their burroughs one or sometimes 200 acres of land. the\r\nburrows are seperate and are each occupyed perhaps by ten or 12 of\r\nthose animals. there is a little mound in front of the hole formed of\r\nthe earth thrown out of the burrow and frequently there are three or\r\nfour distinct holes forming what I term one burrow with their mouths\r\narround the base of this little mound which seems to be occupyed as a\r\nwatch-tower in common by the inhabitants of those several holes. these\r\nmounds are sometimes as much as 2 feet high and 4 feet in diameter, and\r\nare irregularly distributed over the tract they occupy at the distance\r\nof from ten to thirty or 40 yds. when you approach a burrow the\r\nsquirrels, one or more, usually set erect on these mounds and make a\r\nkind of shrill whistleing nois, something like tweet, tweet, tweet, &c.\r\nthey do not live on grass as those of the missouri but on roots. one\r\nwhich I examined had in his mouth two small bulbs of a speceis of\r\ngrass, which resemble very much what is sometimes called the grassnut.\r\nthe intestins of those little animals are remarkably large for it's\r\nsize. fur short and very fine.--the grass in their villages is not cut\r\ndown as in those of the plains of the missouri. I preserved the skins\r\nof several of these animals with the heads feet and legs entire. The\r\nBlack woodpecker which I have frequently mentioned and which is found\r\nin most parts of the roky Mountains as well as the Western and S. W.\r\nmountains. I had never an opportunity of examining untill a few days\r\nsince when we killed and preserved several of them. this bird is about\r\nthe size of the lark woodpecker of the turtle dove, tho it's wings are\r\nlonger than either of those birds. the beak is black, one inch long,\r\nreather wide at the base, somewhat curved, and sharply pointed; the\r\nchaps are of equal length. arround the base of the beak including the\r\neye and a small part of the throat is of a fine crimson red. the neck\r\nand as low as the croop in front is of an iron grey. the belly and\r\nbreast is a curious mixture of white and blood reed which has much the\r\nappearance of having been artifically painted or stained of that\r\ncolour. the red reather predominates. the top of the head back, sides,\r\nupper surface of the wings and tail are black, with a gossey tint of\r\ngreen in a certain exposure to the light. the under side of the wings\r\nand tail are of a sooty black. it has ten feathers in the tail, sharply\r\npointed, and those in the center reather longest, being 21/2 inches in\r\nlength. the tongue is barbed, pointed, and of an elastic cartelaginous\r\nsubstance. the eye is moderately large, puple black and iris of a dark\r\nyellowish brown. this bird in it's actions when flying resembles the\r\nsmall redheaded woodpecke common to the Atlantic states; it's note also\r\nsomewhat resembles that bird. the pointed tail seems to assist it in\r\nseting with more eas or retaining it its resting position against the\r\nperpendicular side of a tree. the legs and feet are black and covered\r\nwith wide imbricated scales. it has four toes on each foot of which two\r\nare in rear and two in front; the nails are much curved long and\r\nremarkably keen or sharply pointed. it feeds on bugs worms and a\r\nvariety of insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 27, 1806]\r\nTuesday 27th May 1806\r\nA cloudy morning Serjt.

M he\r\nreturned with the horse and he was killed and butchered; he was large\r\nand in good order. hohastillpilp told us that most of the horses which\r\nwe Saw running in those plains in this neighbourhood at large belonged\r\nto himself and his people, and whenever we were in want of meet, he\r\nrequested that would kill any of them we wished; this is a piece of\r\nliberallity which would do honour to Such as host of civilization.\r\nSerjt. Pryor, Gibson & Shields returned from the Village with a good\r\nStock of roots and bread. Shabono Lapage & Yourk whome we had Sent to\r\npurchase roots for ourselves remained at the Village all night.\r\nDrewyer, Labiech & Crusat return at 4 P.M. with 5 Deer which they had\r\nkilled at Some distance up Collin's Creek on this Side, that Stream\r\nStill continue So high that they could not pass it.\r\n\r\nShabono's child is much better to day; tho the Swelling on the Side of\r\nhis neck I believe will termonate in an ugly imposthume a little below\r\nthe ear. The Indians were so anxious that the Sick Chief (who has lost\r\nthe use of his limbs) Should be Sweted under our inspection they\r\nrequested me to make a 2d attempt to day; accordingly the hole was\r\nenlargened and his father a very good looking old man performed all the\r\ndrugery &c. we could not make him Swet as copously as we wished. being\r\ncompelled to keep him erect in the hole by means of Cords. after the\r\noppiration he complained of Considerable pain, I gave him 30 drops of\r\nLaudnom which Soon composed him and he rested very well-. I observe the\r\nStrongest marks of parental affection. they all appear extreemly\r\nattentive to this Sick man, no do they appear to relax in their\r\nascituity towards him not withstanding he has been Sick and helpless\r\nfor near 5 years. The Chopunnish appeare to be very attentive & kind to\r\ntheir aged people and treat their women with more respect than the\r\nnativs on the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThere is a Species of whistleing Squirel common in these plains which\r\nin their habit Somewhat resembles those of the Missouri but are a\r\ndistinct Species. this little animale measures 1 foot 5 inches & a half\r\nfrom the nose to the extremity of the tail, of which the tail occupies\r\n21/4 inches only; in the girth it is 11 inches the body is\r\nperpotionably long, the neck and legs Short; the ears are Short,\r\nobtusely pointed, and lye close to the head; the aperture of the ear is\r\nlarger proportionably than most animals which burrow. the eyes are of\r\nModerate Size, the puple black and iris of a dark dusky brown. the\r\nteeth are like those of the Squirel as is it's whole contour. the\r\nwhiskers are full, long and black; it has also Some long black hars\r\nabove the eye-. it has five toes on each foot; the 2 iner toes of the\r\nfore feet are remarkably Short, and have Short blunt nails. the\r\nremaining toes on these feet are long Slightly Curved, black and\r\nSharply pointed. the outer and inner toes of the hind feet are not\r\nShort yet they are by no means as long as the three toes in the Center\r\nof the foot which are remarkably long but the nails are not as long as\r\nthose of the fore feet tho of the Same form and colour. the bars of the\r\ntail tho thickly inserted on every part respects the two Sides only.\r\nthis givs it a flat appearance and a long oval form. the tips of the\r\nhair which forms the outer edges of the tail are white. the bace of the\r\nhair are either black or a fox red. the under disk of the tail is an\r\niron gray, the upper a redish brown. the lower part of the jaws, under\r\npart of the neck, legs and feet from the body down and belly are of a\r\nlight brick red. the nose as high as the eyes is of a darker brick red.\r\nthe upper part of the head neck and body are of a curious brownish gray\r\ncolour with a cast of the brick red. the longer hairs of these parts\r\nbeing of a redish white colour at their extremities fall together in\r\nSuch a Manner as to give it to the appearance of being Spekled at a\r\nlittle distance. these animals form large ascoations as those of the\r\nMissouri, occupying with their burroughs one or Sometimes 200 acres of\r\nLand. the burrows are Seperate and are each occupyed perhaps by 10 or\r\n12 of those Animals. there is a little Mound in front of the hole\r\nformed of the earth thrown out of the burrow and frequently there are\r\nthree or four distinct holes forming what I call one burrow, around the\r\nbase of the mound, which Seams to be occupied as a watch tower in\r\ncommon by the inhabitents of those Several holes. these Mounds are\r\nSometimes as much as 2 feet high, and 4 feet in diameter, and are\r\nirregularly distributed over the tract they occupy at the distance of\r\nfrom ten to 30 or forty yards.

I\r\nfirst met with this bird above the three forks of the Missouri and saw\r\nthem on the hights of the rocky Mountains but never before had an\r\nopportunity of examining them closely. the small corvus discribed at\r\nFort Clatsop is a different speceis, tho untill now I had taken it to\r\nbe the same, this is much larger and has a loud squawling note\r\nsomething like the mewing of a cat. the beak of this bird is 11/2\r\ninches long, is proportionably large, black and of the form which\r\ncharacterizes this genus. the upper exceeds the under chap a little.\r\nthe head and neck are also proportionably large. the eye full and\r\nreather prominent, the iris dark brown and puple black. it is about the\r\nsize and somewhat the form of the Jaybird tho reather rounder or more\r\nfull in the body. the tail is four and a half inches in length,\r\ncomposed of 12 feathers nearly of the same length. the head neck and\r\nbody of this bird are of a dove colour. the wings are black except the\r\nextremities of six large fathers ocupying the middle joint of the wing\r\nwhich are white. the under disk of the wing is not of the shining or\r\ngrossy black which marks it's upper surface. the two feathers in the\r\ncenter of the tail are black as are the two adjacent feathers for half\r\ntheir width the ballance are of a pure white. the feet and legs are\r\nblack and imbricated with wide scales. the nails are black and\r\nremarkably long and sharp, also much curved. it has four toes on each\r\nfoot of which one is in the rear and three in front. the toes are long\r\nparticularly that in the rear. this bird feeds on the seed of the pine\r\nand also on insects. it resides in the rocky mountains at all seasons\r\nof the year, and in many parts is the only bird to be found.--our\r\nhunters brought us a large hooting Owl which differs considerably from\r\nthose of the Atlantic States which are also common here. the plumage of\r\nthis owl is an uniform mixture of dark yellowish brown and white, in\r\nwhich the dark brown predominates. it's colour may be properly termed a\r\ndark iron grey. the plumage is very long and remarkably silky and soft.\r\nthese have not the long feathers on the head which give it the\r\nappearance of ears or horns. the leathers of the head are long narrow\r\nand closely set, they rise upwright nearly to the extremity and then\r\nare bent back sudonly as iff curled. a kind of ruff of these feathers\r\nincircle the thoat. the head has a flat appearance being broadest\r\nbefore and behind and is 1 foot 10 Is. in circumference. incircling the\r\neyes and extending from them like rays from the center a tissue of open\r\nhairy long feathers are placed of a light grey colour, these conceal\r\nthe ears which are very large and are placed close to the eyes behind\r\nand extending below them. these feathers meet over the beak which they\r\nnearly conceal and form the face of the owl. they eyes are remarkably\r\nlarge and prominant, the iris of a pale goald colour and iris circular\r\nand of a deep sea green. the beak is short and wide at it's base. the\r\nupper chap is much curved at the extremity and comes down over and in\r\nfront of the under chap. this bird is about the size of the largest\r\nhooting Owl. the tail is composed of eleven feathers, of which those in\r\nthe center are reather the longest. it is booted to the extremity of\r\nthe toes, of which it has four on each foot, one in the rear one on the\r\nouter side and two in front. the toes are short particularly that in\r\nrear, but are all armed with long keen curved nails of a dark brown\r\ncolour. the beak is white and nostrils circular large and unconnected.\r\nthe habits and the note of this owl is much that of the common large\r\nhooting owl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 28, 1806]\r\nWednesday May 28th 1806\r\nWe sent Goodrich to the Village of the broken Arm for hair to Stuff\r\nSaddle pads.

The Sick Chief is much better\r\nthis morning he can use his hands and arms and Seems much pleased with\r\nthe prospects of recovering, he Says he feels much better than he has\r\ndone for a great Number of Months. I Sincerly wish that the Swetts may\r\nrestore him. I have Consented to repeet the Sweets.\r\n\r\nThe Country along the rocky mountains for Several hundred Miles in\r\nlength and about 50 in width is leavel extremely fertile and in many\r\nparts Covered with a tall and opult. growth of the long leafed pine.\r\nnear the Watercourses the hills are lofty tho are covered with a good\r\nSoil and not remarkably Stoney and possess more timber than the leavel\r\ncountry. the bottom lands on the Water courses are reather narrow and\r\nconfined tho fertile and Seldom inundated. this Country would form an\r\nextensive Settlement; the Climate appears quit as mild as that of a\r\nSimilar latitude on the Atlantic Coast; & it cannot be otherwise than\r\nhealthy; it possesses a fine dry pure air. the grass and maney plants\r\nare now upwards of Knee high. I have no doubt that this tract of\r\nCountry if Cultivated would produce in great abundance every article\r\nesentially necessary to the comfort and Subsistence of civillized man.\r\nto it's present inhabitents nature Seems to have dealt with a liberal\r\nhand, for she has distributed a great variety of esculent plants over\r\nthe face of the Country which furnish them a plentiful Store of\r\nprovisions; those are acquired but little toil; and when prepared after\r\nthe method of the nativs afford not only a nutricious but an agreeable\r\nfood. among other roots those Called by them the Quawmash and Cows are\r\nesteemd. the most agreeable and valuable as they are also the most\r\nabundant in those high plains.\r\n\r\nThe Cows is a knobbed root of an erregularly rounded form not unlike\r\nthe Gensang in form and Consistence; this root they Collect, rub off a\r\nthin black rhind which Covers it and pounding it exposes it in cakes to\r\nthe Sun. these Cakes are about an inch and 1/4 thick and 6 by 18 in\r\nwedth, when dry they either eat this bread alone without any further\r\npreperation, or boil it and make a thick Musilage; the latter is most\r\ncommon & much the most agreeable. the flower of this root is not very\r\nunlike the gensang-. this root they Collect as early as the Snow\r\ndisappears in the Spring, and Continues to collect it untill the\r\nQuawmash Supplies it's place which happins about the Middle of June.\r\nthe quawmash is also Collected for a fiew weeks after it first makes\r\nit's appearance in the Spring, but when the scape appears it is no\r\nlonger fit for use untill the Seed are ripe which happens about the\r\ntime just mentioned. and then the Cows declines. The Cows is also\r\nfrequently dried in the Sun and pounded afterwards and used in\r\nthickening Supe and Makeing Mush.\r\n\r\nThe Chopunnish held a Council in the morning of the 12th among\r\nthemselves in respect to the Subject on which we had Spoken to them the\r\nday before, the result as we learnt was favourable, they placed\r\nConfidence in the information they had recived and resolved to pursue\r\nour advise. after this Council was over the principal Chief or the\r\nbroken arm, took the flour of the roots of Cows and thickened the Soup\r\nin the Kitiles and baskets of all his people, this being ended he made\r\na harangue the purpote of which was makeing known the deliberations of\r\ntheir councils and impressing the necessity of unanimity among them,\r\nand a strict attention to the resolution which had been agreed on in\r\nCouncell; he concluded by enviting all such men as had resolved to\r\nabide by the decree of the councill to come and eat, and requested Such\r\nas would not be So bound to Show themselves by not partakeing of the\r\nfeast. I was told by one of our men who was present in the house, that\r\nthere was not a decenting voice on this great National question, but\r\nall Swallowed their objections if any they had, very cheerfully with\r\ntheir mush-. dureing the time of this loud animated harangue of the\r\nChief the women Cryed wrung their hands, tore their hair and appeared\r\nto be in the utmost distress. after this cerimoney was over, the Chiefs\r\nand considerate men came in a body to where we were Seated at a little\r\ndistance from our tent, and two young men at the instance of the nation\r\npresented Capt L. and myself each a fine horse. and informed us that\r\nthey had listened with attentioned to what we had Said and were\r\nresolved to pursue our Counsels &c.--That as we had not seen the Black\r\nfoot Indians and the Minetarries of Fort dePrarie they did not think it\r\nsafe to venter over to the plains of the Missouri, where they would\r\nfondly go provided those nations would not kill them. that when we had\r\nestablished a tradeing house on the Missouri as we had promised they\r\nwould Come over and trade for arms Amunition &c. and live about us.\r\nthat it would give them much pleasure to be at peace with those nations\r\naltho they had Shed much of their blood-. They Said that they were pore\r\nbut their hearts were good. we might be assured of their sincerety.\r\nSome of their brave men would go over with us to the Missouri and bring\r\nthem the news as we wished, and if we Could make a peace between them\r\nand their enimies on the other Side of the mountains their nation would\r\ngo over to the Missouri in the latter end of the Summer. on the Subject\r\nof one of their Chiefs accompanying us to the land of the White men\r\nthey Could not yet determine, but that they would let us know before we\r\nleft them. that the Snow was yet so deep in the Mountains that if we\r\nattempted to pass, we would Certainly perish, and advised us to remain\r\nuntill after the next full Moon when the Snow would disappear on the\r\nSouth hill sides and we would find grass for our horses.-.

I have called them the horned Lizzard. they are\r\nabout the size and a good deel the figure of the common black lizzard.\r\nbut their bellies are broader, the tail shorter and their action much\r\nslower; they crawl much like the toad. they are of brown colour with\r\nyellowish and yellowishbrown spots. it is covered with minute scales\r\nintermixed with little horny prosesses like blont prickles on the upper\r\nsurface of the body. the belley and throat is more like the frog and\r\nare of a light yelowish brown colour. arround the edge of the belley is\r\nregularly set with little horney projections which give to those edges\r\na serrate figure the eye is small and of a dark colour. above and\r\nbehind the eyes there are several projections of the bone which being\r\narmed at their extremities with a firm black substance has the\r\nappearance of horns sprouting out from the head. this part has induced\r\nme to distinguish it by the apppellation of the horned Lizzard. I\r\ncannot conceive how the engages ever assimilated this animal with the\r\nbuffaloe for there is not greater analogy than between the horse and\r\nthe frog. this animal is found in greatest numbers in the sandy open\r\nparts of the plains, and appear in great abundance after a shower of\r\nrain; they are sometimes found basking in the sunshine but conceal\r\nthemselves in little holes in the earth much the greater preportion of\r\ntheir time. they are numerous about the falls of the Missouri and in\r\nthe plains through which we past lately above the Wallahwallahs.--The\r\nChoke Cherry has been in blume since the 20th inst. it is a simple\r\nbranching ascending stem. the cortex smooth and of a dark brown with a\r\nredish cast. the leaf is scattered petiolate oval accute at its apex\r\nfinely serrate smooth and of an ordinary green. from 11/2 to 3 inches\r\nin length and 13/4 to 2 in width. the peduncles are common, cilindric,\r\nand from 4 to 5 inches in length and are inserted promiscuously on the\r\ntwigs of the preceeding years growth. on the lower portion of the\r\ncommon peduncle are frequently from 3 to 4 small leaves being the same\r\nin form as those last discribed. other peduncles 1/4 of an inch in\r\nlength are thickly scattered and inserted on all sides of the common\r\npeduncle at wright angles with it each elivating a single flower, which\r\nhas five obtuse short patent white petals with short claws inserted on\r\nthe upper edge of the calyx. the calyx is a perianth including both\r\nstamens and germ, one leafed fine cleft entire simiglobular, infrior,\r\ndeciduous. the stamens are upwards of twenty and are seated on the\r\nmargin of the flower cup or what I have called the perianth. the\r\nfilaments are unequal in length subulate inflected and superior\r\nmembranous. the anthers are equal in number with the filaments, they\r\nare very short oblong & flat, naked and situated at the extremity of\r\nthe filaments, is of a yelow colour as is also the pollen. one\r\npistillum. the germen is ovate, smooth, superior, sessile, very small;\r\nthe Style is very short, simple, erect, on the top of the germen,\r\ndeciduous. the stigma is simple, flat very short.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 29, 1806]\r\nThursday 29th of May 1806\r\nNo movement of the party to day worthy of notice. we have once more a\r\ngood Stock of Meat and roots.

Sence my arrival here I have\r\nkilled Several birds of the Corvus genus of a kind found only in the\r\nrocky mountains and their neighbourhood. I first met with bird on\r\nJeffersons River. and Saw them on the hights of the rocky mountains.\r\nbut never before had an oppertunity of examineing them Closely. the\r\nSmall Corvus discribed at Fort Clatsop is a different Species, tho\r\nuntill now I had taken it to be the Same, this is much larger and has a\r\nloud squaling note something like the newing of a Cat. the beak of this\r\nbird is 11/2 inches long, is proportionably large, black and of the\r\nform which characterize this genus. the upper exeeds the under Chap a\r\nlittle. the head and neck are also propotionably large, the eyes full\r\nand reather prominant, the iris dark brown and purple black. it is\r\nabout the Size and Some what the form of the jay bird, tho reather\r\nrounder and more full in the body. the tail is four and a half inches\r\nin length, composed of 12 feathers nearly of the Same length. the head,\r\nneck and body of this bird is of a dove Colour. the wings are black\r\nexcept the extremities of Six large feathers occupying the middle joint\r\nof the wings which are White. the under disk of the wings are not of\r\nthe shineing or glossy black which mark it's upper Surface. the two\r\nfeathers in the Center of the tail are black as are the two adjacent\r\nfeathers for half their wedth, the ballance are of a pure White. the\r\nfeet and legs are black, and imbricated with wide Scales, the nails are\r\nblack and remarkably long and Sharp, also much Curved, it has four toes\r\non each foot of which one is in the rear and 3 in front. the toes are\r\nlong particular that in the rear. this bird feeds on the Seeds of the\r\npine and also on insects. it resides in the rocky Mountains at all\r\nSeasons of the year, and in many parts is the only bird to be found. a\r\nSpecies of Lizzard Called by the French engages, Prarie buffaloe are\r\nnativs of these plains as well as those of the Missouri. I have Called\r\nthem the horned Lizzard. they are about the Size and a good deel the\r\nfigure of the Common black lizzard. but their bellies are broader, the\r\ntail Shorter and their action much Slower; they Crawl much like the\r\ntoad. they are of a brown Colour with yellowish and yellowish brown\r\nSpots. it is covered with minute scales intermixed with little horney\r\nlike blunt prickkles on the upper Surface of the body. the belly and\r\nthroat is more like the frog and are of a light yellowish brown Colour.\r\naround the edge of the belly is regularly Set with little horney\r\nprejections which give to those edges a Serrate figure, the eye is\r\nSmall and of a dark colour. above and behind the eyes there are Several\r\nProjections of the bone which being armed at their extremities with a\r\nfirm black Substance has the appearance of horns Sprouting out from the\r\nhead. this part has induced me to distinguish it by the appellation of\r\nthe Horned Lizard. I cannot conceive how the engagees ever assimilated\r\nthis animal withe Buffalow for there is not grater anology than between\r\nthe Horse and the frog. this Animal is found in greatest numbers in the\r\nSandy open parts of the Plains, and appear in great abundance after a\r\nrain; they are Sometimes found basking in the Sunshine but conceal\r\nthemselves in little holes under the tufts of grass or herbs much the\r\ngreater proportion of their time. they are noumerous about the Falls of\r\nMissouri, and in the plains through which we passed lately above the\r\nFalls of Columbia\r\n\r\nThe Choke Cherry has been in blume Since the 20th inst. it is a Simple\r\nbranching ascending Stem. the Cortex Smooth and of a dark brown with a\r\nredish Cast. the leaf is scattered petiolate oval accute at it's apex\r\nfinely Serated Smooth and of an ordinary green, from 21/2 to 3 inches\r\nin length and from 11/4 to 2 in width. the Peduncles cilindric and\r\nCommon from 4 to 5 inches in length and are inserted promiscuisly on\r\nthe twigs of the proceeding years growth. on the lower portion of the\r\nCommon peduncle are frequently from 3 to 4 Small leaves, being the same\r\nin form as those last discribed. other peduncles 1/4 of an inch in\r\nlength are Scattered and thickly inserted on all sides of the Common\r\npeduncle at right-angles with it, each elivateing a Single flower,\r\nwhich has five obtuse Short patent white petals with Short claws\r\nincerted on the upper edge of the calyx. the Calyx is a perianth\r\nincluding both Stemes & germ, one leafed five cleft entire, Semi\r\nglobular. the Stamons are upwards of twenty and are Seated on the\r\nMargin of the flower Cup or what I have Called the perianth. the\r\nfilaments are unequal in length Subulate inflected and Superior\r\nmembranous. the anthers are equal in number with the filaments, they\r\nare very Short oblong and flat, naked and Situated at the extremity of\r\nthe filaments. is of a yellowish colour asis also the pollen. one\r\npistillum. the germin is ovate, Smooth, Superior, sessile, very Small;\r\nthe Style is very Short, Simple, erect, on the top of the germen\r\ndeciduous. the Stigma is Simple, flat very Short.

Celindric, villose\r\nand of a pale red Colour. the branches are but fiew and those near it's\r\nupper extremity. the extremities of the branches are flexable and are\r\nbent down near their extremities with the weight of the flowers. the\r\nleaf is sessile, scattered thinly, nearly lineor tho Somewhat widest in\r\nthe middle, two inches in length, absolutely entire, villose, obtusely\r\npointed and of an Ordinary green. above each leaf a Small Short branch\r\nprotrudes, Supporting a tissue of four or five Small leaves of the Same\r\nappearance of those discribed. a leaf is placed under neath each branch\r\nand each flower. the Calyx is one flowered Spatha. the corolla\r\nSuperior, consists of four pale perple petals which are tripartite, the\r\nCenteral lobe largest and all terminate obtusely; they are inserted\r\nwith a long and narrow claw on the top of the germ, are long, Smooth\r\nand deciduous. there are two distinct Sets of Stamens the first or\r\nprincipal Consists of four, the filaments which are capillary, erect,\r\ninserted on the top of the germ alternately with the petals, equal\r\nshort, membranus; the anthers are also four each being elivated with\r\nit's fillaments; they are reather flat, erect sessile, cohering to the\r\nbase, membranous, longitudinally furrowed, twise as long as the\r\nfillament naked, and of a pale purple colour, the Second Set of Stamens\r\nare very minute, are also four and placed within and opposit to the\r\npetals, those are Scercely precptable while the first are large &\r\nConspicious, the fillaments are capillary equal, very Short white and\r\nSmooth. the anthers are four, oblong, beaked, erect Cohering at the\r\nbase, membanous, Shorter than the fillaments, White naked and appear\r\nnot to form pollen, there is one pistillum; the germ of which is also\r\none, celindric, villous, inferior, Sessile, as long as the first\r\nStamuns, and grooved. the Single Style and Stigma form a perfect mono\r\npetallous corolla only with this difference that the Style which\r\nelivates the Stigma or limb is not a tube but solid tho it's outer\r\nappearance is that of a tube of a Monopetallous corolla swelling as it\r\nascends and gliding in such manner into the limb that it Cannot be Said\r\nwhere the Style ends or the Stigma begins, jointly they are as long as\r\nthe Gorilla, while the limb is four cleft, Sauser Shaped, and the\r\nmargin of the lobes entire and rounded. this has the appearance of a\r\nmonopetallous flower growing from the Center of the four petalled\r\ncorollar which is rendered more conspicuous in consequence of the first\r\nbeing white and the latter of a pale purple. I regret very much that\r\nthe Seed of this plant are not ripe as yet and it is probable will not\r\nbe so dureing our residence in this neighbourhood-. our Horses maney of\r\nthem have become So wild that we Cannot take them without the\r\nassistance of the indians who are extreemly dextrous in throwing a Rope\r\nand takeing them with a noose about the neck; as we frequently want the\r\nuse of our horses when we cannot get the use of the indians to take\r\nthem, we had a Strong pound formed to day in order to take them at\r\npleasure-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 30, 1806]\r\nFriday May 30th 1806.\r\nLapage and Charbono set out to the indian vilages early this morning\r\nfor the purpose of trading with them for roots; Sergt. Gass was sent\r\nthis morning to obtain some goats hair to stuff the padds of our\r\nsaddles. he ascended the river on this side and being unable to pass\r\nthe river opposite to the village he wished to visit, returned in the\r\nevening unsuccessfull. Shannon and Collins were permitted to pass the\r\nriver in order to trade with the natives and lay in a store of roots\r\nand bread for themselves with their proportion of the merchandize as\r\nthe others had done; in landing on the opposite shore the canoe was\r\ndriven broad side with the full forse of a very strong current against\r\nsome standing trees and instantly filled with water and sunk. Potts who\r\nwas with them is an indifferent swimer, it was with much difficulty he\r\nmade the land. they lost three blankets a blanket coat and their\r\npittance of merchandize. in our bear state of clootheing this was a\r\nserious loss. I sent Sergt. Pryor and a party over with the indian\r\ncanoe in order to raise and secure ours but the debth of the water and\r\nthe strength of the current baffled every effort. I fear that we have\r\nalso lost our canoe. all our invalides are on the recovery. we gave the\r\nsick Cheif a severe sweat today, shortly after which he could move one\r\nof his legs and thyes and work his toes pretty well, the other leg he\r\ncan move a little; his fingers and arms seem to be almost entirely\r\nrestored. he seems highly delighted with his recovery. I begin to\r\nentertain strong hope of his restoration by these sweats. in the\r\nevening Joseph Feild returned in surch of his horses which had left\r\nthem last evening and returned to camp. Feilds informed us that himself\r\nand his brother whom he had left at their camp 6 ms. distant on\r\nCollin's creek, had killed 3 deer. The reptiles which I have observed\r\nin this quarter are the Rattlesnake of the speceis discribed on the\r\nMissouri, they are abundant in every part of the country and are the\r\nonly poisonous snake which we have yet met with since we left St.\r\nLouis. the 2 speceis of snakes of an inosent kind already discribed.\r\nthe common black lizzard, the horned lizzard, a smal green tree frog,\r\nthe smal frog which is common to our country which sings in the spring\r\nof the year, a large speceis of frog which resorts the water\r\nconsiderably larger than our bull frog, it's shape seems to be a medium\r\nbetween the delicate and lengthy form of our bull frog and that of our\r\nland frog or toad as they are sometimes called in the U States. like\r\nthe latter their bodies are covered with little pustles or lumps,\r\nelivated above the ordinary surface of the body; I never heard them\r\nmake any sound or nois. the mockerson snake or coperhead, a number of\r\nvipers a variety of lizzards, the toad bullfrog &c common to the U\r\nStates are not to be found in this country. most of the insects common\r\nto the U States are found here. the butterflies, common house and\r\nblowing flies, the horse flies, except the goald coloured ear fly, tho\r\nin stead of this fly we have a brown coloured fly about the same size\r\nwhich attatches itself to that part of the horse and is equally as\r\ntroublesome. the silkworm is also found here. a great variety of\r\nbeatles common to the Atlantic states are found here likewise. except\r\nfrom this order the large cow beatle and the black beatle usually alled\r\nthe tumble bug which are not found here. the hornet, the wasp and\r\nyellow wasp or yellow jacket as they are frequently called are not met\r\nwith in this quarter. there is an insect which much resembles the\r\nlatter only a vast deel larger which are very numerous particularly in\r\nthe rocky mountains on the waters of the Columbia; these build in the\r\nground where they form a nest like the hornet with an outer covering to\r\nthe comb in which they deposit their eggs and raise their young. the\r\nsheets of this comb are attatched to each other as those of the hornets\r\nare. their wings are four of a dark brown colour. the head is black,\r\nthe body and abdomen are yellow incircled with transverse rings of\r\nblack, they are ferce and sting very severely, we found them\r\ntroublesome in frightening our horses as we passed those mountains. the\r\nhoney bee is not found here. the bumble bee is. one of the men brought\r\nme today some onions from the high plain of a different speceis from\r\nthose near the borders of the river as they are also from the shive or\r\nsmall onion noticed below the falls of the Columbia. these onions were\r\nas large as a nutmeg, they generally grow double or two bulbs connected\r\nby the same tissue of radicles; each bulb has two long liniar flat\r\nsolid leaves. the peduncle is solid celindric and crowned with an umbal\r\nof from 20 to 30 flowers. this onion is exceedingly crisp and\r\ndelicately flavoured indeed I think more sweet and less strong than any\r\nI ever taisted. it is not yet perfectly in blow, the parts of the\r\nflower are not distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 30, 1806]\r\nFriday May 30th 1806.\r\nLapage and Shabono Set out early this morning to the Indian Village in\r\norder to trade with them for roots; Serjt. Gass was Sent this morning\r\nto obtain Some goats hair to Stuf the pads of our Saddles; he assended\r\nthe river on this Side and being unable to pass the river to the\r\nvillage he wished to visit returned in the evening unsucksessfull.\r\nShannon and Collins were permited to pass the river in order to trade\r\nwith the nativs and lay in a Store of roots and bread for themselves\r\nwith their proportion of the merchendize as others had done; on landing\r\non the opposit Shore the Canoe was driven broad Side with the full\r\nforce of a very Strong Current against Some Standing trees and\r\ninstantly filled with water and Sunk. Potts who was with them is an\r\nindifferent Swimer, it was with dificuelty he made the land. they lost\r\nthree blankets and a Blanket Cappo and their pittance of Merchindize.\r\nin our bear State of Clothing this was a Serious loss. I Sent Serjt.\r\nPryor and a party over in the Indian Canoe in order to raise and Secure\r\nours but the debth of the water and the Strength of the Current baffled\r\nevery effort. I fear that we have also lost our Canoe.all our involedes\r\nare on the recovery. we gave the Sick Chief a Severe Swet to day,\r\nShortly after which he could move one of his legs and thy's and work\r\nhis toes pritty well, the other leg he can move a little; his fingers\r\nand arms Seem to be almost entirely restored. he Seems highly delighted\r\nwith his recovery. I begin to entertain Strong hope of his recovering\r\nby these Sweats in the evening Joseph Fields returned in serch of his\r\nhorses which had left them last evening and returned to Camp. Field\r\ninformed us that himself and his brother whome he had left at their\r\nCamp 6 ms. distant on Collins Creek had killed 3 Deer.--The reptiles\r\nwhich I have observed in this quarter are the Rattle Snake of the\r\nSpecies discribed on the Missouri, they are abundant in every part of\r\nthe Country and are the only poisonous Snake which we have met with\r\nSince we left St. Louis. the Second Species of Snake of an inosent kind\r\nalready discribd. the Common black Lizzard, the horned Lizzard, a small\r\ngreen tree-frog; the Same frog which is common to our Country which\r\nSings in the Spring of the year. a large Species of frog which resorts\r\nthe water considerably larger than our bull-frog, it's Shape Seems to\r\nbe a Medium between the delicate and lengthy form of our bullfrogs and\r\nthat of our land frog or toad as they are Sometimes called in the\r\nUnited States. like the latter their bodies are covered with little\r\npustles or lumps, elevated above the ordinary Surface of the body; I\r\nnever heard them make any Sound or noise, the Mockerson Snake or Copper\r\nhead, a number of vipers, a variety of Lizzards, the toad bullfrog &c.\r\ncommon to the U. States are not to be found in this Country. Most of\r\nthe insects common to the U States are found here. the butterfly,\r\ncommon house and blowing flies, the horse flies, except the gold\r\ncoloured ear fly. tho in Stead of this fly we have a brown coloured fly\r\nabout the same Size which attatches itself to that part of the horse\r\nand is equally as troublesom. the Silk worm is also found here. a great\r\nvariety of beatles common to the atlantic States are Seen here\r\nlikewise. except from this order the large Cow beatle and the black\r\nbeatle usially termed tumble bug which are not found here. the hornet,\r\nthe Wasp and yellow Wasp or yellow jacket as they are frequently Called\r\nare not met with in this quarter. there is an insect which much\r\nresembles the latter only a vast deel larger which are very noumerous\r\nparticular in the Rocky mountains on the waters of the Columbia, those\r\nbuild in the ground where they form a nest like the hornet with an\r\nouter covering to the Comb in which they deposit their eggs and raise\r\ntheir young. the Sheets of this Comb are attatched to each other as\r\nthose of the hornets are. their wings are four of a dark brown\r\nColour--the head is black, the body and abdomin are yellow insercled with\r\ntransverce rings of black, they are firce and Sting very Severely; we\r\nfound them troublesom in frightening our horses as we passed through\r\nmountains. the honey bee is not found here. the bumblebee is. one of\r\nthe men brought me to day Some Onions from the high plains of a\r\ndifferent Species from those near the borders of the river as they are\r\nalso from the Shive or Small Onion noticed below the Falls of Columbia.\r\nthese Onions were as large as an nutmeg, they generally grow double or\r\ntwo bulbs connected by the same tissue of radicles; each bulb has two\r\nlong liner flat solid leaves. the pedencle is solid celindric and\r\ncround with an umble of from 20 to 30 flowers. this Onion is\r\nexceedingly crisp and delicately flavoured indeed. I think more Sweet\r\nand less strong than any I ever tasted, it is not yet perfectly in\r\nblume, the parts of the flower are not distinct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, May 31, 1806]\r\nSaturday May 31st 1806.\r\nGoodrich and Willard visited the indian Villages this morning and\r\nreturned in the evening. Willard brought with him the dressed skin of a\r\nbear which he had purchased for Capt. C. this skin was an uniform pale\r\nredish brown colour, the indians informed us that it was not the\r\nHoh-host or white bear, that it was the Yack-kah. this distinction of\r\nthe indians induced us to make further enquiry relative to their\r\nopinons of the several speceis of bear in this country. we produced the\r\nseveral skins of the bear which we had killed at this place and one\r\nvery nearly white which I had purchased. The white, the deep and plale\r\nred grizzle, the dark bron grizzle, and all those which had the\r\nextremities of the hair of a white or frosty colour without regard to\r\nthe colour of the ground of the poil, they designated Hoh-host and\r\nassured us that they were the same with the white bear, that they\r\nascosiated together, were very vicisious, never climbed the trees, and\r\nhad much longer nails than the others. the black skins, those which\r\nwere black with a number of intire white hairs intermixed, the black\r\nwith a white breast, the uniform bey, brown and light redish brown,\r\nthey designated the Yack-kah;-said that they climbed the trees, had\r\nshort nails and were not vicious, that they could pursue them and kill\r\nthem with safety, they also affirmed that they were much smaller than\r\nthe white bear. I am disposed to adopt the Indian distinction with\r\nrispect to these bear and consider them two distinct speceis. the white\r\nand the grizzly of this neighbourhood are the same of those found on\r\nthe upper portion of the Missouri where the other speceis are not, and\r\nthat the uniform redish brown black &c of this neighbourhood are a\r\nspeceis distinct from our black bear and from the black bear of the\r\nPacific coast which I believe to be the same with those of the Atlantic\r\ncoast, and that the common black bear do not exist here. I had\r\npreviously observed that the claws of some of the bear which we had\r\nkilled here had much shorter tallons than the variagated or white bear\r\nusually have but supposed that they had woarn them out by scratching up\r\nroots, and these were those which the indians called Yak-kah. on\r\nenquiry I found also that a cub of an uniform redish brown colour, pup\r\nto a female black bear intermixed with entire white hairs had climbed a\r\ntree. I think this a distinct speceis from the common black bear,\r\nbecause we never find the latter of any other colour than an uniform\r\nblack, and also that the poil of this bear is much finer thicker and\r\nlonger with a greater proportion of fur mixed with the hair, in other\r\nispects they are much the same.--This evening Joseph and R. Feilds\r\nreturned with the three deer which they had killed. The Indians brought\r\nus another of our origional Stock of horses; there are only two absent\r\nnow of those horses, and these the indians inform us that our shoshone\r\nguide rode back when he returned. we have sixty five horses at this\r\ntime, most of them in excellent order and fine strong active horses.-\r\n\r\nThe Indians pursued a mule deer to the river opposite to our camp this\r\nevening; the deer swam over and one of our hunters killed it. there\r\nbeing a large party of indians assembled on this occasion on the\r\nopposite side, Hohast-ill-pilp desired them to raise our canoe which\r\nwas sunk on that side of the river yesterday; they made the attempt but\r\nwere unable to effect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, May 31, 1806]\r\nSaturday May 31st 1806\r\nGoodrich and Willard visited the indian Village this morning and\r\nreturned in the evening Willard brought with him the dressed Skin of a\r\nbear which he had purchased for me. this Skin was of a uniform pale\r\nredish brown colour, the indians inform us that it was not the Hoh-host\r\nor white bear, that it was the Yack-kah this distinction of the indians\r\ninduced us to make further enquiry relitive to their oppinions of the\r\ndefferent Species of bear in this country. We produced the Several\r\nSkins of the bear which our hunters had killed at this place and one\r\nvery nearly white which Capt Lewis had purchased. the White, the deep\r\nand pale red grizzle, the dark brown grizzle, and all those that had\r\nthe extremities of the hair of a White or frosty Colour without reguard\r\nto the Colour of the ground of the poil, they disignated Hoh-host and\r\nassured us that they were the Same with the White bear, that they\r\nassociated together, were very vicisious, never climb the trees, and\r\nhad much longer nails than the others. The black skins, those which\r\nwere black with a number of entire white hairs intermixed, the black\r\nwith a White breast, the uniform bey, brown and light redish brown,\r\nthey disignated the Yack-kah-; Said that they Climb the trees had Short\r\nnails and were not viscisious, that they could prosue them and kill\r\nthem in Safty, they also affirmed that they were much Smaller than the\r\nwhite bear. I am disposed to adopt the Indians distinction with respect\r\nto these bear and consider them two distinct Species. the White and the\r\nGrizzly of this neighbourhood are the Same as those found on the upper\r\npart of the Missouri where the other Species are not, and that the\r\nuniform redish brown black &c. of this neighbourhood are a Species\r\ndistinct from both Species of our black bear and from the black bear of\r\nthe Pacific Coast which I believe to be the Same with those of the\r\nAtlantic Coast, and that the Common black bear do not exist here. I had\r\npreviously observed that the claws of Some of the bear which we had\r\nkilled here had much Shorter tallons than the varigated or White bear\r\nusially have but Supposed that they had worn them out by scratching out\r\nroots, and these were those which the indians call Yahkah. on enquiry I\r\nfound also that a Cub of a uniform redish brown Colour pup to a female\r\nblack bear intermixed with entire white hairs, had climbed a tree. I\r\nthink this a distinct Species from the common black bear becaus we\r\nnever find the latter of any other Colour than a uniform black, and\r\nalso that the poil of this bear is much finer thicker and longer with a\r\ngreater proportion of fur mixed with the hair, in other respects they\r\nare much the same\r\n\r\nThis evening, Joseph and Reuben Fields returned with the three deer\r\nthey had killed. The indians brought us another of our Original Stock\r\nof Horses; there are only two Absent now of these horses, and these the\r\nindians inform us that our Sho-Sho-ne guide rode back when he returned.\r\nwe have Sixty five horses at this time, most of them in excellent order\r\nand fine Strong active horses\r\n\r\nThe Indians pursued a Mule deer to the river opposit to our Camp this\r\nevening; the deer Swam over and one of our hunters killed it. there\r\nbeing a large party of indians assembled on this Occasion on the\r\nopposit Side with Tin-nach-e-moo-tolt they attempted to rais our Canoe\r\nwhich was Sunk on that Side of the river yesterday; they made the\r\nattempt but were unable to effect it-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 1, 1806]\r\nSunday June 1st 1806.\r\nYesterday evening Charbono an LaPage returned, having made a broken\r\nvoyage. they ascended the river on this side nearly opposite to a\r\nvillage eight miles above us, here their led horse which had on him\r\ntheir merchandize, feell into the river from the side of a steep clift\r\nand swam over; they saw an indian on the opposite side whom they\r\nprevailed on to drive their horse back again to them; in swiming the\r\nriver the horse lost a dressed Elkskin of LaPages and several small\r\narticles, & their paint was destroyed by the water. here they remained\r\nand dryed their articles the evening of the 30th Ult. the indians at\r\nthe village learning their errand and not having a canoe, made an\r\nattempt esterday morning to pass the river to them on a raft with a\r\nparsel of roots and bread in order to trade with them; the indian raft\r\nstruck a rock, upset and lost thir cargo; the river having fallen heir\r\nto both merchandize and roots, our traders returned with empty bags.\r\nThis morning Drewyer accompanyed by Hohastillpilp set out in surch of\r\ntwo tomahawks of ours which we have understood were in the possession\r\nof certain indians residing at a distance in the plains on the South\r\nside of the Kooskoske; the one is a tomahawk which Capt. C. left at our\r\ncamp on Musquetoe Creek and the other was stolen from us while we lay\r\nat the forks of this and the Chopunnish rivers last fall. Colter and\r\nWillard set out this morning on a hunting excurtion towards the quamash\r\ngrounds beyond Collins's Creek. we begin to feel some anxiety with\r\nrispect to Sergt. Ordway and party who were sent to Lewis's river for\r\nsalmon; we have received no inteligence of them since they set out. we\r\ndesired Drewyer to make some enquiry after the Twisted hair; the old\r\nman has not been as good as his word with rispect to encamping near us,\r\nand we fear we shall be at a loss to procure guides to conduct us by\r\nthe different routs we wish to pursue from Traveller's rest to the\r\nwaters of the Missouri.--I met with a singular plant today in blume of\r\nwhich I preserved a specemine; it grows on the steep sides of the\r\nfertile hills near this place, the radix is fibrous, not much branched,\r\nannual, woody, white and nearly smooth. the stem is simple branching\r\nascending, 21/2 feet high celindric, villose and of a pale red colour.\r\nthe branches are but few and those near it's upper extremity. the\r\nextremities of the branches are flexable and are bent down near their\r\nextremities with the weight of the flowers. the leaf is sissile,\r\nscattered thinly, nearly linear tho somewhat widest in the middle, two\r\ninches in length, absolutely entire, villose, obtusely pointed and of\r\nan ordinary green. above each leaf a small short branch protrudes,\r\nsupporting a tissue of four or five smaller leaves of the same\r\nappearance with those discribed. a leaf is placed underneath eah\r\nbranch, and each flower. the calyx is a one flowered spathe. the\r\ncorolla superior consists of four pale perple petals which are\r\ntripartite, the central lobe largest and all terminate obtusely; they\r\nare inserted with a long and narrow claw on the top of the germ, are\r\nlong, smooth, & deciduous. there are two distinct sets of stamens the\r\n1st or principal consist of four, the filaments of which are capillary,\r\nerect, inserted on the top of the germ alternately with the petals,\r\nequal short, membranous; the anthers are also four each being elivated\r\nwith it's fillament, they are linear and reather flat, erect sessile,\r\ncohering at the base, membranous, longitudinally furrowed, twise as\r\nlong as the fillament naked, and of a pale perple colour. the second\r\nset of stamens are very minute are also four and placed within and\r\nopposite to the petals, these are scarcely persceptable while the 1st\r\nare large and conspicuous; the filaments are capillary equal, very\r\nshort, white and smooth. the anthers are four, oblong, beaked, erect,\r\ncohering at the base, membranous, shorter than the fillaments, white\r\nnaked and appear not to form pollen. there is one pistillum; the germ\r\nof which is also one, cilindric, villous, inferior, sessile, as long as\r\nthe 1st stamens, and marked with 8 longitudinal furrows. the single\r\nstyle and stigma form a perfict monapetallous corolla only with this\r\ndifference, that the style which elivates the stigma or limb is not a\r\ntube but solid tho it's outer appearance is that of the tube of a\r\nmonopetallous corolla swelling as it ascends and gliding in such manner\r\ninto the limb that it cannot be said where the style ends, or the\r\nstigma begins; jointly they are as long as the corolla, white, the limb\r\nis four cleft, sauser shaped, and the margins of the lobes entire and\r\nrounded. this has the appearance of a monopetallous flower growing from\r\nthe center of a four petalled corollar, which is rendered more\r\nconspicuous in consequence of the 1st being white and the latter of a\r\npale perple. I regret very much that the seed of this plant are not yet\r\nripe and it is proble will not be so during my residence in this\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 1, 1806]\r\nSunday June 1st 1806.\r\nLate last evening Shabono & Lapage returnd. haveing made a broken\r\nvoyage. they assended the river on this Side nearly opposit to the\r\nVillage Eight miles above us, here their led horse who had on him their\r\nStock of Merchindize fell into the river from the Side of a Steep Clift\r\nand swam over, they Saw an indian on the opposit side whome they\r\nprovailed on to drive their horse back again to them; in swiming the\r\nhorse lost a dressed Elk skin of LaPages and Several small articles,\r\nand their paint was distroyed by the water. here they remained and\r\ndryed their articles the evening of the 30th ulto. the indians at the\r\nvillage learned their errand and not haveing a canoe, made an attempt\r\nYesterday morning made an attempt to pass the river to them on a raft\r\nwith a parcel of roots and bread in order to trade with them; the\r\nindian raft Struck a rock upset and lost their Cargo; the river haveing\r\nSwallowed both Merchindize & roots, our traders returned with empty\r\nbags. This morning Geo. Drewyer accompanied by Hohastillpilp Set out in\r\nSerch of two tomahawks of ours which we have understood were in the\r\npossession of certain indians resideing at a distance in the Plains on\r\nthe South Side of Flat Head river; one is a pipe tomahawk which Capt L.\r\nleft at our Camp on Musquetor Creek and the other was stolen from me\r\nwhilst we lay at the forks of this and Chopunnish rivers last fall.\r\nColter and Willard Set out this morning on a hunting excurtion towards\r\nthe quawmash grounds beyond Colins creek. we begin to feel Some anxiety\r\nwith respect to Sergt. Ordway and party who were Sent to Lewis's river\r\nfor salmon; we have receved no intillegence of them Sence they Set out.\r\nwe desired Drewyer to make Some enquiry after the Twisted hair; the old\r\nman has not been as good as his word with respect to encamping near us,\r\nand we fear we Shall be at a loss to procure guides to conduct us by\r\nthe different routs we wish to pursue from Travillers rest to the\r\nwaters of the Missouri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 2, 1806]\r\nMonday June 2cd 1806.\r\nMcNeal and york were sent on a trading voyage over the river this\r\nmorning. having exhausted all our merchandize we are obliged to have\r\nrecourse to every subterfuge in order to prepare in the most ample\r\nmanner in our power to meet that wretched portion of our journy, the\r\nRocky Mountain, where hungar and cold in their most rigorous forms\r\nassail the waried traveller; not any of us have yet forgotten our\r\nsufferings in those mountains in September last, and I think it\r\nprobable we never shall. Our traders McNeal and York were furnished\r\nwith the buttons which Capt. C. and myself cut off our coats, some eye\r\nwater and Basilicon which we made for that purpose and some Phials and\r\nsmall tin boxes which I had brought out with Phosphorus. in the evening\r\nthey returned with about 3 bushels of roots and some bread having made\r\na successful) voyage, not much less pleasing to us than the return of a\r\ngood cargo to an East India Merchant.--Collins, Sheilds, R & J. Feilds\r\nand Shannon set out on a hunting excurtion to the Quawmash grounds on\r\nthe lower side of Collins's Creek. our horses many of them have become\r\nso wild that we cannot take them without the assistance of the Indians\r\nwho are extreemly dextrous in throwing a rope and taking them with a\r\nnoose about the neck; as we frequently want the use of our horses when\r\nwe cannot get the assistance of the indians to take them, we had a\r\nstrong pound formed today in order to take them at pleasure. Drewyer\r\narrived this evening with Neeshneparkkeeook and Hohastillpilp who had\r\naccompanyed him to the lodges of the persons who had our tomahawks. he\r\nobtained both the tomahawks principally by the influence of the former\r\nof these Cheifs. the one which had been stolen we prized most as it was\r\nthe private property of the late Sergt. Floyd and Capt. C. was\r\ndesireous of returning it to his friends. the man who had this tomahawk\r\nhad purchased it from the Indian that had stolen it, and was himself at\r\nthe moment of their arrival just expiring. his relations were unwilling\r\nto give up the tomehawk as they intended to bury it with the disceased\r\nowner, but were at length induced to do so for the consideration of a\r\nhadkerchief, two strands of beads, which Drewyer gave them and two\r\nhorses given by the cheifs to be killed agreeably to their custom at\r\nthe grave of the disceased. The bands of the Chopunnish who reside\r\nabove the junction of Lewis's river and the Kooskooske bury their dead\r\nin the earth and place stones on the grave. they also stick little\r\nsplinters of wood in betwen the interstices of the irregular mass of\r\nstone piled on the grave and afterwards cover the whole with a roof of\r\nboard or split timber. the custom of sacreficing horses to the\r\ndisceased appears to be common to all the nations of the plains of\r\nColumbia. a wife of Neeshneeparkkeeook died some short time since,\r\nhimself and hir relations saceficed 28 horses to her. The Indians\r\ninform us that there are a plenty of Moos to the S. E. of them on the\r\nEast branch of Lewis's river which they call Tommanamah R. about Noon\r\nSergt. Ordway Frazier and Wizer returned with 17 salmon and some roots\r\nof cows; the distance was so great from which they had brought the fish\r\nthat most of them were nearly spoiled. these fish were as fat as any I\r\never saw; sufficiently so to cook themselves without the addition of\r\ngrease; those which were sound were extreemly delicious; their flesh is\r\nof a fine rose colour with a small admixture of yellow. these men set\r\nout on the 27th ult. and in stead of finding the fishing shore at the\r\ndistance of half a days ride as we had been informed, they did not\r\nreach the place at which they obtained their fish untill the evening of\r\nthe 29th having travelled by their estimate near 70 miles. the rout\r\nthey had taken however was not a direct one; the Indians conducted them\r\nin the first instance to the East branch of Lewis's river about 20\r\nmiles above it's junction with the South branch, a distance of about 50\r\nMs. where they informed them they might obtain fish; but on their\r\narrival at that place finding that the salmon had not yet arrived or\r\nwere not taken, they were conducted down that river to a fishery a few\r\nmiles below the junction of the forks of Lewis's river about 20 Ms.\r\nfurther, here with some difficulty and remaining one day they purchased\r\nthe salmon which they brought with them. the first 20 Ms. of their rout\r\nwas up Commeap Creek and through a plain open country, the hills of the\r\ncreek continued high and broken with some timber near it's borders. the\r\nballance of their rout was though a high broken mountanous country\r\ngenerally well timbered with pine the soil fertile in this quarter they\r\nmet with an abundance of deer and some bighorned animals. the East fork\r\nof Lewis's river they discribe as one continued rapid about 150 Yds.\r\nwide it's banks are in most places solid and perpendicular rocks, which\r\nrise to a great hight; it's hills are mountains high. on the tops of\r\nsome of those hills over which they passed, the snow had not entirely\r\ndisappeared, and the grass was just springing up. at the fishery on\r\nLewis's river below the forks there is a very considerable rapid nearly\r\nas great from the information of Segt. Ordway as the great falls of the\r\nColumbia the river 200 Yds. wide. their common house at this fishery is\r\nbuilt of split timber 150 feet long and 35 feet wide flat at top. The\r\ngeneral course from hence to the forks of Lewis's river is a little to\r\nthe West of south about 45 Ms.--The men at this season resort their\r\nfisheries while the women are employed in collecting roots. both forks\r\nof Lewis's river above their junction appear to enter a high\r\nMountainous country.--my sick horse being much reduced and apearing to\r\nbe in such an agoni of pain that there was no hope of his recovery I\r\nordered him shot this evening. the other horses which we casterated are\r\nall nearly recovered, and I have no hesitation in declaring my beleif\r\nthat the indian method of gelding is preferable to that practiced by\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 2, 1806]\r\nMonday June 2nd 1806\r\nMcNeal and York were Sent on a tradeing voyage over the river this\r\nmorning. having exhosted all our Merchendize we were obliged to have\r\nrecourse to every Subterfuge in order to prepare in the most ample\r\nmanner in our power to meet that wretched portion of our journy, the\r\nRocky Mountains, where hungar and Cold in their most regorous form\r\nassail the waried traveller; not any of us have yet forgotten our those\r\nmountains in September last, I think it probable we never Shall. Our\r\ntraders McNeal and York are furnished with the buttons which Capt L-.\r\nand my Self Cut off of our Coats, Some eye water and Basilicon which we\r\nmade for that purpose and Some phials of eye water and Some tin boxes\r\nwhich Capt L. had brought from Philadelphia. in the evening they\r\nreturned with about 3 bushels of roots and Some bread haveing made a\r\nSuckcessfull voyage, not much less pleasing to us than the return of a\r\ngood Cargo to an East India merchant.\r\n\r\nShields, Collins, Reuben & Joseph Field & Shannon Set out on a hunting\r\nexcurtion to the quaw mash the lower side of Collins Creek & towards\r\nthe Mountains.\r\n\r\nDrewyer arived this evening with Neeshneparkkeeook and Hohashillpilp\r\nwho had accompanied him to the lodge of the person who had our\r\ntomahawks. he obtained both the tomahawks principally by the influence\r\nof the former of those Chiefs. the one which had been Stolen we prized\r\nmost as it was the private property of the late Serjt. Floyd and I was\r\ndesireous of returning it to his friends. The man who had this tomahawk\r\nhad purchased it from the man who had Stolen it, and was himself at the\r\nmoment of their arival just expireing. his relations were unwilling to\r\ngive up the tomahawk as they intended to bury it with the deceased\r\nowner, but were at length to do so for the Consideration of a\r\nhandkerchief, two Strands of heeds, which drewyer gave them and two\r\nhorses given by the Chiefs to be Killed agreeable to their custom at\r\nthe grave of the deceased. The custom of Sacrificeing horses to the\r\ndisceased appears to be Common to all the nations of the plains of the\r\nColumbia. a Wife of Neeshneeparkkeeook died Some Short time Sence,\r\nhimself and her relations sacrificed horses to her. The Indians inform\r\nus that there is a plenty of Moos to the S. E. of them on the East\r\nbranch of Lewis's river which they Call Tommawamah River. About noon\r\nSergt. Ordway Frazier and Wiser returnd. with 17 Salmon and Some roots\r\nof the Cows; the distance was So great from whence they brought the\r\nfish, that most of them were nearly Spoiled. those fish were as fat as\r\nany I ever saw; Sufficiently So to cook themselves without the addition\r\nof Grease or butter; those which were Sound were extreemly delicious;\r\ntheir flesh is of a fine rose colour with a Small admixture of yellow.\r\nthese men Set out on the 27th ulto. and in Sted of finding the fishing\r\nShore at the distance of half a days ride as we had been informed, they\r\ndid not reach the place at which they obtained their fish untill the\r\nevening of the 29th haveing traveled near 70 miles. the rout they had\r\ntaken however was not a direct one; the Indians Conducted them in the\r\nfirst instance to the East fork of Lewis's river about 10 miles above\r\nit's junction with the South branch, a distance of about 50 miles where\r\nthey informed them they might obtain fish; but on their arival at that\r\nplace finding that the Salmon had not arived or were not taken, they\r\nwere Conducted down that river to a fishery a fiew miles below the\r\njunction of the forks of Lewis's River about 20 miles further, here\r\nthey remained one day and with some dificuelty, they purchased the\r\nSalmon which they brought with them. the first 20 ms. Of their rout was\r\nup Commeap Creek and through a plain open Country, the hills of the\r\nCreek Continued high and broken with Some timber near it's borders, the\r\nballance of their rout was through a high broken Mountanious Country.\r\ngenerally well timbered with pine the soil fertile. in this quarter the\r\nmeet with abundance of deer and Some big-horned Animals. The East fork\r\nof Lewis's river they discribe as one Continued rapid of about 150\r\nyards wide, it's banks are in most places Solid and perpindicular\r\nrocks, which rise to a great hight; it's hills are mountanious high. on\r\nthe top of Some of those hills over which they passed, the Snow had not\r\nentirely disappeared, and the grass was just springing up. at the\r\nfishery on Lewis's river below the forks there is a very Considerable\r\nrapid, nearly as Great from the information of Sergt. Ordway as the\r\nGreat falls of the Columbia the river 200 yards wide. their common\r\nhouse at this fishery is built of Split timber 150 feet long and 35\r\nfeet in width, flat at top. the general Course from here to the forks\r\nof Lewis's river is a little to the west of South about 45 ms. The men\r\nat this Season resort their fisheries while the womin are employed in\r\ncollecting roots-. both forks above the junction of Lewis's river\r\nappear to enter a high Mountainious Country. our horses are all\r\nrecovering & I have no hesitation in declareing that I believe that the\r\nIndian Method of guilding preferable to that practised by ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 3, 1806]\r\nTuesday June 3rd 1806.\r\nOur invalids are all on the recovery; Bratton is much stronger and can\r\nwalk about with considerable ease. the Indian Cheif appears to be\r\ngradually recovering the uce of his limbs, and the child is nearly\r\nwell; the imposthume on his neck has in a great measure subsided and\r\nleft a hard lump underneath his left ear; we still continue the\r\napplication of the onion poltice. at 2 P.M. The Broken arm and 3 of his\r\nwariars visited us and remained all night. Colter, Jo. Fields and\r\nWillard returned this evening with five deer and one bear of the brown\r\nspeceis; the hair of this was black with a large white spot on the\r\nbreast containing a small circular black spot. today the Indians\r\ndispatched an express over the mountains to travellers rest or the\r\nneighbourhood of that Creek on Clark's river in order to learn from the\r\nOote-lash-shoots a band of the Flatheads who have wintered there, the\r\noccurrences that have taken place on the East side of the mountains\r\nduring that season. this is the band which we first met with on that\r\nriver. the mountains being practicable for this express we thought it\r\nprobable that we could also pass, but the indians informed us that\r\nseveral of the creeks would yet swim our horses, that there was no\r\ngrass and that the roads were extreemly deep and slipery; they inform\r\nus that we may pass conveniently in twelve or fourteen days. we have\r\ncome to a resolution to remove from hence to the quawmash grounds\r\nbeyond Collins's creek on the 10th to hunt in that neighbourhood a few\r\ndays, if possible lay in a stock of meat and then attempt the mountains\r\nabout the middle of this month. I begin to lose all hope of any\r\ndependance on the Salmon as this river will not fall sufficiently to\r\ntake them before we shall leave it, and as yet I see no appearance of\r\ntheir runing near the shores as the indians informed us they would in\r\nthe course of a few days. I find that all the salmon which they procure\r\nthemselves they obtain on Lewis's river, and the distance thither is\r\ntoo great for us to think of sending after them even had we merchandize\r\nwith which to purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 3, 1806]\r\nTuesday June 3rd 1806\r\nOur invalids are all on the recovery; bratten is much Stronger and can\r\nwalk about with Considerable ease. the Indian Chief appears to be\r\ngradually recovering the use of his limbs, and the child is nearly\r\nwell; the inflomation on his neck Continus but the Swelling appears to\r\nSubside. we Still Continue the application of the onion poltice. at 3\r\nP.M. the broken arm and three wariors visited us and remained all\r\nnight. Colter, Jos. Fields and Willard returned this evening with five\r\ndeer and one bear of the brown Species; the hair of this was black with\r\na large white Spot on the breast containing a Small circular black\r\nSpot. (this Species of bear is Smaller than our Common black bear) this\r\nwas a female bear and as our hunters informed us had cubs last year,\r\nthis they judged from the length and Size of her tits &c. this bear I\r\nam Confident is not larger than the yerlin Cubs of our Country. To day\r\nthe Indians dispatched an express over the mountains to Travellers rest\r\nor to the neighbourhood of that Creek on Clark's river in order to\r\nlearn from a band of Flat-Heads who inhabit that river and who have\r\nprobably Wintered on Clarks river near the enterance of travellers rest\r\nCreek, the occurences which have taken place on the East Side of the\r\nmountains dureing the last winter. this is the band which we first met\r\nwith on that river. the Mountains being practicable for this express we\r\nthought it probable that we could also pass, but the Chiefs informs us\r\nthat Several of the Creek's would yet swim our horses, that there was\r\nno grass and that the road was extreemly deep and slipery; they inform\r\nus that we may pass Conveniently in twelve or fourteen days. we have\r\ncome to a resolution to remove from hence to the Quawmash Grounds\r\nbeyond Colins Creek on the 10th to hunt in that neighbourhood a fiew\r\ndays, if possible lay in a Stock of Meat, and then attempt the\r\nMountains about the Middle of this month. I begin to lose all hope of\r\nany dependance on the Salmon as this river will not fall Sufficiently\r\nto take them before we Shall leave it, and as yet I see no appearance\r\nof their running near the Shore as the indians informed us they would\r\nin the course of a fiew days. I find that all the Salmon which they\r\nprecure themselves they obtain on Lewis's river, and the distance\r\nthither is too great for us to think of Sending after them, even had we\r\nmerchendize with which to purchase the salmon.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 4, 1806]\r\nWednesday June 4th 1806.\r\nabout noon The 3 Cheifs left us and returned to their vilages. while\r\nthey were with us we repeated the promises we had formerly made them\r\nand invited them to the Missouri with us, they declined going untill\r\nthe latter end of the summer and said it was there intention to spend\r\nthe ensuing winter on the East side of the Rocky mountains. they gave\r\nus no positive answer to a request which we made, that two or three of\r\ntheir young men should accompany me to the falls of the Missouri and\r\nthere wait my return from the upper part of Maria's river where it was\r\nprobable I should meet with some of the bands of the Minnetares from\r\nFort de Prarie; that in such case I should indeavor to bring about a\r\ngood understanding between those indians and themselves, which when\r\neffected they would be informed of it though the young men thus sent\r\nwith me, and that on the contrary should I not be fortunate enough to\r\nmeet with these people nor to prevail on them to be at peace they would\r\nequally be informed through those young men, and they might still\r\nremain on their guard with rispect to them untill the whites had it in\r\ntheir power to give them more effectual releif. The Broken Arm invited\r\nus to his village and said he wished to speak to us before we set out,\r\nand that he had some roots to give us for our journey over the\r\nmountains; Capt.

Feilds Shannon\r\nand Labuish return from the chaise and brought with them five deer and\r\na brown bear. among the grasses of this country I observe a large\r\nspeceis which grows in moist situations; it rises to the hight of eight\r\nor ten feet, the culm is jointed, hollow, smooth, as large as a goos\r\nquill and more firm than ordinary grasses; the leaf is linnear broad\r\nand rough; it has much the appearance of the maden cain as it is called\r\nin the state of Gergia, and retains it's virdure untill late in the\r\nfall. this grass propegates principally by the root which is horizontal\r\nand perennial. a second speceis grows in tussucks and rises to the\r\nhight of six or eight feet; it seems to delight in the soil of the\r\nriver bottoms which possess a greater mixture of sand than the hills in\r\nthis neighbourhood. this is also a harsh course grass; it appears to be\r\nthe same which is called the Corn grass in the Southern states, and the\r\nfoxtail in Virginia. a third speceis resembles the cheet, tho the\r\nhorses feed on it very freely. a fourth and most prevalent speceis is a\r\ngrass which appears to be the same called the blue grass common to many\r\nparts of the United States; it is common to the bottom as well as the\r\nuplands, is now seeding and is from 9 inches to 2 feet high; it affords\r\nan excellent pasture for horses and appears to bear the frosts and snow\r\nbetter than any grass in our country; I therefore regret very much that\r\nthe seed will not be ripe before our probable departure. this is a fine\r\nsoft grass and would no doubt make excellent hay if cultivated.

C. This Cheif left me in the evening and\r\nreturned to his village. Capt C. Visited the Broken Arm today agreeably\r\nto his promise; he took with him Drewyer and several others. they were\r\nreceived in a friendly manner. The Broken Arm informed Capt. C. that\r\nthe nation would not pass the mountain untill the latter end of the\r\nsummer, and that with rispect to the young men whom we had requested\r\nshould accompany us to the falls of the Missouri, were not yet\r\nscelected for that purpose nor could they be so untill there was a\r\nmeeting of the nation in counsil. that this would happen in the course\r\nof ten or twelve days as the whole of the lodges were about to remove\r\nto the head of the Commeap Creek in the plain near Lewis's river, that\r\nwhen they had assembled themselves they would hold a council and\r\nscelect the young men. that if we set out previously to that period the\r\nmen would follow us. we therefore do not calculate on any assistance\r\nfrom them as guides, but depend more upon engageing some of the\r\nOotlashshoots in the neighborhood of Travellers rest C. for that\r\npurpose. The broken arm gave Capt. C. a few dryed Quawmas roots as a\r\ngreat present, but in our estimation those of cows are much better, I\r\nam confident they are much more healthy. The men who were with Capt. C.\r\nobtained a good store of roots and bread in exchange for a number of\r\nlittle notions, using the Yanke phrase, with which their own enginuity\r\nhad principally furnished them. on examination we find that our whole\r\nparty have an ample store of bread and roots for our voyage, a\r\ncircumstance not unpleasing. They retuned at 5 P.M. shortly after which\r\nwe were visited by Hohastillpilp the two young Cheifs who gave us the\r\nhorses in behalf of the nation some time since and several others, who\r\nremained all night. The Kooskooske is about 150 Yds. wide at this place\r\nand discharges a vast body of water; notwithstanding it high state the\r\nwater remains nearly transparent, and it's temperature appeas to be\r\nquite as cold as that of our best springs. we meet with a beautifull\r\nlittle bird in this neighbourhood about the size and somewhat the shape\r\nof the large spar-row. it is reather longer in proportion to it's bulk\r\nthan the sparrow. it measures 7 inches from the extremity of the beek\r\nto that of the tail, the latter occupying 21/2 inches. the beak is\r\nreather more than half an inch in length, and is formed much like the\r\nVirginia nitingale; it is thick and large for a bird of it's size; wide\r\nat the base, both chaps convex, and pointed, the uper exceeds the under\r\nchap a little is somewhat curved and of a brown colour; the lower chap\r\nof a greenish yellow. the eye full reather large and of a black colour\r\nboth puple and iris. the plumage is remarkably delicate; that of the\r\nneck and head is of a fine orrange yellow and red, the latter\r\npredominates on the top of the head and arround the base of the beak\r\nfrom whence it graduly deminishes & towards the lower part of the neck,\r\nthe orrange yellow prevails most; the red has the appearance of being\r\nlaid over a ground of yellow. the breast, the sides, rump and some long\r\nfeathers which lie between the legs and extend underneath the tail are\r\nof a fine orrange yellow. the tail, back and wings are black, ecept a\r\nsmall stripe of yellow on the outer part of the middle joint of the\r\nwing, 1/4 of an inch wide and an inch in length. the tail is composed\r\nof twelve feathers of which those in the center are reather shortest,\r\nand the plumage of all the feathers of the tail is longest on that side\r\nof the quill next the center of the tail. the legs and feet are black,\r\nnails long and sharp; it has four toes on each foot, of which three are\r\nforward and one behind; that behind is as long as the two outer of the\r\nthree toes in front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 6, 1806]\r\nFriday June 6th 1806\r\nI visited the Broken Arm to day agreeable to my promis of the 4th inst.\r\nand took with me Drewyer & three other men I was receved in a friendly\r\nmanner. The broken Arm informed me that maney of the Small chiefs of\r\nthe different Bands of his nation had not heard our word from our own\r\nmouths, Several of them were present and was glad to See me &c. I\r\nrepeeted in part what had been Said in Council before. The Broken arm\r\ntold me that the nation would not pass the mountains untill the latter\r\npart of the Summer, and with respect to the young men who we had\r\nrequested to accompany us to the falls of Missouri, were not yet\r\nSelected for that purpose nor could they be So untill they had a\r\nMeeting of the Nation in Council. that this would happen in the Course\r\nof ten or 12 days as the whole of the Lodges were about to Move to the\r\nhead of Commeap Creek in the Plain of Lewis's river, that when they\r\nheld a council they would Select two young men. that if we Set out\r\npreviously to that time the men would follow us. we therefore do not\r\nCalculate any assistance from them as guides, but depend more upon\r\nengageing Some of the Oatlash-shoots on Clarks river in the\r\nneighbouringhood of Travellers rest C. for that purpose. The Broken Arm\r\ngave me a fiew Quawmash roots as a great preasent, but in my estimation\r\nthose of Cows is much better. I am Confident they are much more\r\nhealthy. The Broken Arm informed me that they had latterly been\r\ninformed that a party of the Shoshones had arived at the Ye-E-al-po\r\nNation who reside to the South of the enterance of Kooskooske into\r\nLewis's river. and had informed that people that their nation (the\r\nShoshones) had received the talk which was given their relations on the\r\nhead of the East fork of Lewis's river last fall, and were resolved to\r\npursue our Councils, and had came foward for the purpose of makeing\r\npeace with them, and allso with the Chopunnish &c. that they had Sent\r\nSeveral men in Serch of those people with a view to bring them to\r\nLewis's river at which place the Broken Arm informed me he Should meet\r\nthem and Smoke the pipe of peace. which he Should afterwards Send by\r\nwith Some of his Chiefs in company with those Shoshones to their nation\r\nand confirm a piece which never Should be broken on his part. he\r\nproduced two pipes one of which he said was as a present to me the\r\nother he intended to Send to the Shoshones &c. and requested me to take\r\none, I receved the one made in the fascion of the Country, the other\r\nwhich was of Stone curiously inlaid with Silver in the common form\r\nwhich he got from the Shoshones. I deckorated the Stem of this pipe\r\nwith blue ribon and white wampom and informed the Chief this was the\r\nemblem of peace with us.\r\n\r\nThe men who accompanied me obtained a good Store of roots and bread in\r\nexchange for a number of little notions, useing the Yanke phrase, with\r\nwhich their own enginuiety had principally furnished them. on\r\nexamonation we find our whole party have a Sufficient Store of bread\r\nand roots for our Voyage. a Circumstance not unpleasing-.\r\n\r\nI returned at 4 P.

There is a\r\nspeceis of cherry which grows in this neighbourhood in sitations like\r\nthe Choke cherry or near the little rivulets and wartercouses. it\r\nseldom grows in clumps or from the same cluster of roots as the choke\r\ncherry dose. the stem is simple branching reather diffuse stem the\r\ncortex is of a redish dark brown and reather smooth. the leaf is of the\r\nordinary dexture and colour of those of most cherries, it is petiolate;\r\na long oval 11/4 inhes in length and 1/2 an inch in width, obtuse,\r\nmargin so finely serrate that it is scarcely perseptable & smooth. the\r\npeduncle is common 1 inch in length, branch proceeding from the\r\nextremities as well as the sides of the branches, celindric gradually\r\ntapering; the secondary peduncles are about 1/2 an inch in length\r\nscattered tho proceeding more from the extremity of the common peduncle\r\nand are each furnished with a small bracted. the parts of\r\nfructification are much like those discribed of the choke cherry except\r\nthat the petals are reather longer as is the calix reather deeper. the\r\ncherry appears to be half grown, the stone is begining to be hard and\r\nis in shape somewhat like that of the plumb; it appears that when ripe\r\nit would be as large as the Kentish cherry, which indeed the growth of\r\nthe bush somewhat resembles; it rises about 6 or 8 feet high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 7, 1806]\r\nSaurday June 7th 1806.\r\nThe two young cheafs and other Indians who accompanied them Crossed the\r\nriver and returned to their Village this morning after brackfast;\r\nShabono Sergt Gass McNeal, Whitehouse & Goodrich accompanied them for\r\nthe purpose of purchaseing or exchangeing old peces of Sane, fish gig,\r\npeces of iron, bullets, and old files and Such articles as they Could\r\nraise for ropes and Strings for to lash their loads, and bags to Cary\r\ntheir roots in Sergt.

George Drewyer Set out on\r\na hunting excurtion up Collins's Creek alone. our party are all much\r\nengaged in prepareing Sadles and packing up their Stores of Provisions\r\n&c.--The Flat Head river is about 150 yards wide at this place and\r\ndischarges a vast body of water; notwithstanding it's high State the\r\nwater remains nearly transparent, and it's temperature appears to be\r\nquit as cold as that of our best Springs. we met with a butifull little\r\nbird in this neighbourhood about the Size and Somewhat the Shape of the\r\nlarge Sparrow. it measures 7 inches from the extremity of the beak to\r\nthat of the tail, the latter Occupying 21/2 inches. the beak is reather\r\nmore than half an inch in length, and is formed much like the Virginia\r\nNightingal; red bd. it is thick and large for a bird of it's size, wide\r\nat the base, both Chaps convex, and pointed, the upper exceeds the\r\nunder chap a little is Somewhat cirved and of a brown Colour; the lower\r\nchap of a Greenish yellow. the eye full reather large and of a black\r\ncolour both puple and iris. the plumage is remarkably delicate; that of\r\nthe neck and head is of a fine orrange yellow and red. the latter\r\npredomonates on the top of the head and around the base of the beak\r\nfrom whence it gradually diminishes towards the lower part of the Neck,\r\nthe orring yellow prevails most, the red has the Appearance of haveing\r\nbeen laid over a Ground of yellow. the breast, the Sides, rump and some\r\nlong feathers which lie between the legs extend underneath the tail is\r\nof a fine orrange yellow. the tail, back and wings are black, except a\r\nSmall Strip of yellow on the outer part of the Middle joint of the\r\nwing, 1/4 of an inch wide and an inch in length. the tail is composed\r\nof 12 feathers of which those in the Center are reather Shortest, and\r\nthe plumage of all the feathers of the tail is longest on that Side of\r\nthe quill next to the Center of the tail. the legs and feet are black,\r\nnails long and Sharp; it has four toes on each foot, of which three are\r\nforward and one behind; that behind is as long as the two outer of the\r\nthree toes in front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 8, 1806]\r\nSunday June 8th 1806.\r\nDrewyer returned this morning from the chase without having killed\r\nanything. his hose left him last night, he pursued him but did not\r\novertake him untill he had nearly reached our camp. The sick Cheif is\r\nfast on the recovery, he can bear his weight on his legs, and has\r\nacquired a considerable portion of strength. the child is nearly well;\r\nBratton has so far recovered that we cannot well consider him an\r\ninvalid any longer, he has had a tedious illness which he boar with\r\nmuch fortitude and firmness.--The Cutnose visited us today with ten or\r\ntwelve warriors; two of the latter were Y-e-let-pos a band of the\r\nChopunnish nation residing on the South side of Lewis's river whom we\r\nhave not previously seen. the band with which we have been most\r\nconversent call themselves pel-late-pal-ler. one of the yeletpos\r\nexchanged his horse for an indifferent one of ours and received a\r\ntomahawk to boot; this tomahawk was one for which Capt. C. had given\r\nanother in exchange with the Clahclel-lah Chief at the rapids of the\r\nColumbia. we also exchanged two other of our indifferent horses with\r\nunsound backs for much better horses in fine order without any\r\nconsideration but the horse itself. several foot rarces were run this\r\nevening between the indians and our men. the indians are very active;\r\none of them proved as fleet as Drewer and R. Fields, our swiftest\r\nrunners. when the racing was over the men divided themselves into two\r\nparties and played prison base, by way of exercise which we wish the\r\nmen to take previously to entering the mountain; in short those who are\r\nnot hunters have had so little to do that they are geting reather lazy\r\nand slouthfull.--after dark we had the violin played and danced for the\r\namusement of ourselves and the indians.--one of the indians informed us\r\nthat we could not pass the mountains untill the full of the next moon\r\nor about the first of July, that if we attempted it sooner our horses\r\nwould be at least three days travel without food on the top of the\r\nmountain; this information is disagreable inasmuch as it causes some\r\ndoubt as to the time at which it will be most proper for us to set out.\r\nhowever as we have no time to loose we will wrisk the chanches and set\r\nout as early as the indians generally think it practicable or the\r\nmiddle of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 8, 1806]\r\nSunday June 8th 1806\r\nDrewyer returned this morning from the chase without killing any thing.\r\nhis horse left him last night and he prosued him near our camp before\r\nhe cought him. The Sick Chief is much mended, he can bear his weight on\r\nhis legs and recovers Strength. the Child has nearly recovered. The Cut\r\nnose and ten or 12 came over today to visit us, two of those were of\r\nthe tribes from the plains of Lewis's river whome we had not before\r\nSeen; one of those men brought a horse which I gave a tomahawk which I\r\nhad exchanged for with the Chief of the Clahclahlah's Nation below the\r\nGreat rapids of Columbia, and broken-down horse which was not able to\r\nCross the mountains. we also exchanged 2 of our indeferent horses for\r\nSound back horses. in the evening Several foot races were run by the\r\nmen of our party and the Indians; after which our party divided and\r\nplayed at prisoners base untill night. after dark the fiddle was played\r\nand the party amused themselves in danceing. one of those Indians\r\ninformed us that we could not cross the mountains untill the full of\r\nthe next moon, or about the 1st of July. if we attempted it Sooner our\r\nhorses would be three days without eateing, on the top of the Mountns.\r\nthis information is disagreeable to us, in as much as it admits of Some\r\ndoubt, as to the time most proper for us to Set out. at all events we\r\nShall Set out at or about the time which the indians Seem to be\r\ngenerally agreed would be the most proper. about the middle of this\r\nmonth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 9, 1806]\r\nMonday June 9th 1806.\r\nThis morning we had all our horses brought up and indeavoured to\r\nexchange five or shix with the Indians in consequence of their having\r\nunsound backs but succeeded in exchanging one only. Hohastillpilp with\r\nseveral of the natives who visited us yesterday took leave of us and\r\nset out for the plains near Lewis's river where the nation are about to\r\nassemble themselves.

The Cutnose\r\nor Neeshneeparkkeeook borrowed a horse and rode down the Kooskooske\r\nRiver a few miles this morning in quest of some young eagles which he\r\nintends raising for the benifit of their feathers; he returned soon\r\nafter with a pair of young Eagles of the grey kind; they were nearly\r\ngrown and prety well feathered. in the evening the young Chief who gave\r\nboth Capt. C. and myself a horse some time since, came to our camp with\r\na party of young men and remained all night. this evening one of our\r\nparty obtained a very good horse for an indifferent one by giving the\r\nindian an old leather shirt in addition. we eat the last of our meat\r\nyesterday evening and have lived on roots today. our party seem much\r\nelated with the idea of moving on towards their friends and country,\r\nthey all seem allirt in their movements today; they have every thing in\r\nreadiness for a move, and notwithstanding the want of provision have\r\nbeen amusing themselves very merrily today in runing footraces pitching\r\nquites, prison basse &c. the river has been falling for several days\r\nand is now lower by near six feet than it has been; this we view as a\r\nstrong evidence that the great body of snow has left the mountains,\r\nthough I do not conceive that we are as yet loosing any time as the\r\nroads is in many parts extreemly steep rocky and must be dangerous if\r\nwet and slippry; a few days will dry the roads and will also improve\r\nthe grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 9, 1806]\r\nModay June 9th 1806\r\nWe had all of our horses brought up and attempted to exchange our Sore\r\nback and most indifferent horses with the indians for Sound back\r\nhorses, we exchanged one only.

Whitehouse returned\r\nthis morning to our camp on the Kooskooske in surch of his horse.--As I\r\nhave had frequent occasion to mention the plant which the Chopunnish\r\ncall quawmash I shall here give a more particular discription of that\r\nplant and the mode of preparing it for food as practiced by the\r\nChopunnish and others in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains with whom\r\nit forms much the greatest portion of their subsistence. we have never\r\nmet with this plant but in or adjacent to a piny or fir timbered\r\ncountry, and there always in the open grounds and glades; in the\r\nColumbian vally and near the coast it is to be found in small\r\nquantities and inferior in size to that found in this neighbourhood and\r\nin the high rich flatts and vallees within the rocky mountains. it\r\ndelights in a black rich moist soil, and even grows most luxuriantly\r\nwhere the land remains from 6 to nine inches under water untill the\r\nseed are nearly perfect which in this neighbourhood or on these flats\r\nis about the last of this month. neare the river where I had an\r\nopportunity of observing it the seed were begining to ripen on the 9th\r\ninst. and the soil was nearly dry. it seems devoted to it's particular\r\nsoil and situation, and you will seldom find it more than a few feet\r\nfrom the inundated soil tho within it's limits it grows very closely in\r\nshort almost as much so as the bulbs will permit; the radix is a\r\ntunicated bulb, much the consistence shape and appearance of the onion,\r\nglutanous or somewhat slymy when chewed and almost tasteless and\r\nwithout smell in it's unprepared state; it is white except the thin or\r\nouter tunicated scales which are few black and not succulent; this bulb\r\nis from the size of a nutmeg to that of a hens egg and most commonly of\r\nan intermediate size or about as large as an onion of one years growth\r\nfrom the seed. the radicles are numerous, reather large, white,\r\nflexable, succulent and diverging. the foliage consists of from one to\r\nfour seldom five radicale, linear sessile and revolute pointed leaves;\r\nthey are from 12 to 18 inches in length and from 1 to 3/4 of an inch in\r\nwidest part which is near the middle; the uper disk is somewhat groved\r\nof a pale green and marked it's whole length with a number of small\r\nlongitudinal channels; the under disk is a deep glossy green and\r\nsmooth. the leaves sheath the peduncle and each other as high as the\r\nsurface of the earth or about 2 inches; they are more succulent than\r\nthe grasses and less so than most of the fillies hyesinths &c.--the\r\npeduncle is soletary, proceeds from the root, is columner, smooth\r\nleafless and rises to the hight of 2 or 21/2 feet. it supports from 10\r\nto forty flowers which are each supported by seperate footstalk of 1/2\r\nan inch in length scattered without order on the upper portion of the\r\npeduncle. the calix is a partial involucret situated at the base of the\r\nfootstalk of each flower on the peduncle; it is long thin and begins to\r\ndecline as soon as the corolla expands. the corolla consists of six\r\nlong oval, obtusly pointed skye blue or water coloured petals, each\r\nabout 1 inch in length; the corolla is regular as to the form and size\r\nof the petals but irregular as to their position, five of them are\r\nplaced near ech other pointing upward while one stands horizantally or\r\npointing downwards, they are inserted with a short claw on the\r\nextremity of the footstalk at the base of the germ; the corolla is of\r\ncourse inferior; it is also shriveling, and continues untill the seeds\r\nare perfect. The stamens are perfect, six in number; the filaments each\r\nelivate an anther, near their base are flat on the inside and rounded\r\non the outer terminate in a subulate point, are bowed or bent upwards,\r\ninserted on the inner side and on the base of the claws of the petals,\r\nbelow the germ, are equal both with rispect to themselves and the\r\ncorolla, smooth & membraneous. the Anther is oblong, obtusely pointed,\r\n2 horned or forked at one end and furrowed longitudinally with four\r\nchannels, the upper and lower of which seem almost to divide it into\r\ntwo loabs, incumbent patent, membranous, very short, naked, two valved\r\nand fertile with pollen, which last is of a yellow colour---the anther\r\nin a few hours after the corolla unfoalds, bursts, discharges it's\r\npollen and becomes very minute and shrivled; the above discription of\r\nthe anther is therefore to be understood of it at the moment of it's\r\nfirst appearance. the pistillum is only one, of which, the germ is\r\ntriangular reather swolen on the sides, smooth superior, sessile,\r\npedicelled, short in proportion to the corolla atho wide or bulky; the\r\nstyle is very long or longer than the stamens, simple, cilindrical,\r\nbowed or bent upwards, placed on the top of the germ, membranous\r\nshrivels and falls off when the pericarp has obtained its full size.\r\nthe stigma is three cleft very minute, & pubescent. the pericarp is a\r\ncapsule, triangular, oblong, obtuse, and trilocular with three\r\nlongitudinal valves. the seed so far as I could judge are numerous not\r\nvery minute and globelar.--soon after the seeds are mature the peduncle\r\nand foliage of this plant perishes, the grownd becomes dry or nearly so\r\nand the root encreases in size and shortly becomes fit for use; this\r\nhappens about the middle of July when the natives begin to collect it\r\nfor use which they continue untill the leaves of the plant attain some\r\nsize in the spring of the year. when they have collected a considerable\r\nquantity of these roots or 20 30 bushels which they readily do by means\r\nof stick sharpened at one end, they dig away the surface of the earth\r\nforming a circular concavity of 21/2 feet in the center and 10 feet in\r\ndiameter; they next collect a parsel of split dry wood with which they\r\ncover this bason in the grown perhaps a foot thick, they next collect a\r\nlarge parsel of stones of about 4 or 6 lbs. weight which are placed on\r\nthe dry wood; fire is then set to the wood which birning heats the\r\nstones; when the fire has subsided and the stones are sufficiently\r\nheated which are nearly a red heat, they are adjusted in such manner in\r\nthe whole as to form as level a surface as pissible, a small quantity\r\nof earth is sprinkled over the stones and a layer of grass about an\r\ninch thick is put over the stones; the roots, which have been\r\npreviously devested of the black or outer coat and radicles which rub\r\noff easily with the fingers, are now laid on in a conical pile, are\r\nthen covered with a layer of grass about 2 or 3 inches thick; water is\r\nnow thrown on the summit of the pile and passes through the roots and\r\nto the hot stones at bottom; some water is allso poared arround the\r\nedges of the hole and also finds its way to the hot stones; as soon as\r\nthey discover from the quantity of steem which issues that the water\r\nhas found its way generally to the hot stones, they cover the roots and\r\ngrass over with earth to the debth of four inches and then build a fire\r\nof dry wood all over the connical mound which they continue to renew\r\nthrough the course of the night or for ten or 12 hours after which it\r\nis suffered to cool two or three hours when the earth and grass are\r\nremoved and the roots thus sweated and cooked with steam are taken out,\r\nand most commonly exposed to the sun on scaffoalds untill they become\r\ndry, when they are black and of a sweet agreeable flavor. these roots\r\nare fit for use when first taken from the pitt, are soft of a sweetish\r\ntast and much the consistency of a roasted onion; but if they are\r\nsuffered to remain in bulk 24 hour after being cooked they spoil. if\r\nthe design is to make bread or cakes of these roots they undergo a\r\nsecond process of baking being previously pounded after the fist baking\r\nbetween two stones untill they are reduced to the consistency of dough\r\nand then rolled in grass in cakes of eight or ten lbs are returned to\r\nthe sweat intermixed with fresh roots in order that the steam may get\r\nfreely to these loaves of bread. when taken out the second time the\r\nwomen make up this dough into cakes of various shapes and sizes usually\r\nfrom 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick and expose it on sticks to dry in the\r\nsun, or place it over the smoke of their fires.--the bread this\r\nprepared if kept free from moisture will keep sound for a great length\r\nof time. this bread or the dryed roots are frequently eaten alone by\r\nthe natives without further preparation, and when they have them in\r\nabundance they form an ingredient in almost every dish they prepare.\r\nthis root is pallateable but disagrees with me in every shape I have\r\never used it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 11, 1806]\r\nWednesday June 11th 1806\r\nAll of our hunters were out by daylight this Morning. Labeech and Shann\r\nwas the only Suckcessull hunters, Labeech killed a Black bear and a\r\nlarge buck, and Gibson killed a very fat Buck. five of the indians also\r\nturned out and hunted untill near Meridn. without having killed any\r\nthing. at 3 P M they all packed up and returned to their village. one\r\nof our men exchanged an indifferent horse for a verey good one with\r\nthose people before they left us. in the evening all our hunters turned\r\nout in different directions with a view to find some probable Spot of\r\nkilling deer and were directed to lay out all night and hunt in the\r\nmorning early. Whitehouse returned this morning to our camp on the\r\nKooskooske in Serch of his horse.\r\n\r\nAs I have had frequent occasion to mention the plant which the\r\nChopunnish and other nations of the Columbia call Quawmash I Shall here\r\ngive a more particular discription of that plant and the mode of\r\nprepareing it for food as practiced by the Chopinnish and others in the\r\nvicinity of the Rocky Mountains with whome it forms much the greatest\r\nportion of their Subsistence. we have never met with this plant but in\r\nor adjacent to a piney or fir timbered Country, and there always in the\r\nopen grounds and glades; in the Columbian Vally and near the Coast it\r\nis to be found in small quantities and inferior in Size to that found\r\nin this neighbourhood or on those high rich flatts and vallies within\r\nthe rocky moun-tains. it delights in a black rich moist Soil, and even\r\ngrows most luxuriently where the lands remain from 6 to 9 inches under\r\nwater untill the seed are nearly perfect, which in this neighbourhood\r\nor on those flatts is about the last of this month. near the river\r\nwhere I had an oppertunity of observing it, the Seed were beginning to\r\nripen on the 9th inst. and the Soil was nearly dry. it seems devoted to\r\nit's particular Soil and Situation, and you will Seldom find more than\r\na fiew feet from an inundated Soil tho within it's limits it grows very\r\nclosely. in short almost as much so as the bulbs will permit. the radix\r\nis a tumicated bulb, much the consistence Shape and appearance of the\r\nOnion, glutinous or somewhat Slymey when chewed and almost tasteless\r\nand without smell in it's unprepared state; it is white except the thin\r\nor outer tumicated scales which are flew black and not Suculent; this\r\nbulb is from the Size of a nutmeg to that of a hen egg and most\r\ncommonly of an intermediate size or about as large as a common onion of\r\none years growth from the Seed. the radicles are noumerous, reather\r\nlarge, white, flexeable, Succulent and deviding the foliage consists of\r\nfrom one to four seldom five radicals, liner Sessile and revolute\r\npointed leaves; they are from 12 to 18 inches in length and from 1 to\r\n3/4 of an inch in widest part which is nearest the middle; the upper\r\ndisk is Somewhat groved of a pale green and marked it's whole length\r\nwith a number of Small longitudinal channels; the under disk is of a\r\ndeep glossy green and Smooth. the leaves sheath the peduncle and each\r\nother as high as the Surface of the earth or about 2 inches; they are\r\nmore succulent than the grasses and less so than most of the lillies\r\nhyisinths &c.--the peduncle is soletary, proceeds from the root, is\r\ncolumner, smooth and leafless and rises to the hight of 2 or 21/2 feet.\r\nit supports from 10 to 40 flowers which are each surported by a\r\nSeperate footstalk of 1/2 an inch in length scattered without order on\r\nthe upper portion of the peduncle. the calix is a partial involucre or\r\ninvolucret Situated at the base of the footstalk of each flower on the\r\npeduncle; it is long thin and begins to decline as soon as the corrolla\r\nexpands. the corolla consists of five long oval obtusely pointed Skye\r\nblue or water coloured petals, each about 1 inch in length; the Corolla\r\nis regular as to the form and size of the petals but irregular as to\r\ntheir position, five of them are placed near each other pointing\r\nupwards while one stands horozontially, or pointing downwards, they are\r\ninserted with a Short Claw on the extremity of the footstalk at the\r\nbase of the germ; the corolla is of course inferior; it is also\r\nshriveling, and continues untill the Seed are perfect. The Stamens are\r\nperfect, Six in number; the falaments each elivate an anther, near\r\ntheir base are flat on the inner side and rounded on the outer,\r\ntermonate in a subulate point, and bowed or bent upwards inserted on\r\nthe inner Side and on the base of the Claws of the petals, below the\r\ngerm, are equal both with respect to themselves and the Corolla, Smooth\r\nmembranous. the Anther is oblong obtusely pointed, 2 horned or forked\r\nat one end and furrowed longitudinally with four channels, the upper\r\nand lower of which Seem almost to divide it into two loabs, incumbent,\r\npatent, membranous, very short, necked, two valved and fertile with\r\npollen, which last is of a yellow colour. the Anther in a fiew hours\r\nafter the Corolla unfoalds, bursts discharges it's pollen and becomes\r\nvery manute and chrivled; the above discription of the Anther is\r\ntherefore to be understood of it, at the moment of it's first\r\nappearance. the pistillum is only one, of which the Germ is triangular\r\nreather Swolen on the Sides, Smooth, Superior, Sessile, pedicelled,\r\nShort in proportion to the Corolla tho wide or bulky; the Style is very\r\nlong or longer than the stamens, simple, cilindrical, bowed or bent\r\nupwards, placed on the top of the germ, membranous shrivels and falls\r\noff when the pericarp has obtained it's full Size.\r\n\r\nthe Stigma is three clefts very manute and pubescent. the pericarp is a\r\ncapsule, triangular, oblong, obtuse, and trilocular with three\r\nlongitudinal valves. the Seed So far as I could judge are noumerous not\r\nvery manute and globilar.--Soon after the seed are mature the peduncle\r\nand foliage of this plant perishes, the ground becoms dry or nearly so\r\nand the root increases in size and shortly become fit for use; this\r\nhappens about the middle of July when the nativs begin to collect it\r\nfor use which they continue untill the leaves of the plant obtain Some\r\nSize in the Spring of the year. when they have Collected a considerable\r\nquantity of these roots or 20 or 30 bushels which they readily do by\r\nmeans of Sticks Sharpened at one end, they dig away the surface of the\r\nearth forming a cercular concavity of 21/2 feet in the center and 10\r\nfeet in diameter; they next collect a parcel of dry split wood with\r\nwhich they cover this bason from the bottom perhaps a foot thick, they\r\nnext collect a parcel of Stones from 4 to 6 lb. weight which are placed\r\non the dry wood; fire is then Set to the wood which burning heats the\r\nStones; when the fire has subsided and the Stones are sufficiently\r\nheated which are nearly a red heat, they are adjusted in such manner in\r\nthe hole as to form as leavel a Surface as possible, a small quantity\r\nof earth is Sprinkled over the Stones, and a layer of grass about an\r\ninch thick is laid over the Stone; the roots which have been previously\r\ndevested of the black or outer coat and radicles which rub off easily\r\nwith the fingers, are now laid on in a circular pile, are then covered\r\nwith a layer of grass about 2 or 3 inches thick; water is then thrown\r\non the Summit of the pile and passes through the roots and to the hot\r\nStones at bottom; Some water is also pored around the edges of the\r\nhole, and also find it's way to the hot Stones. they cover the roots\r\nand grass over with earth to the debth of four inches and then build a\r\nfire of dry wood all over the Connical mound which they Continue to\r\nrenew through the course of the night or for 10 or 12 hours, after\r\nwhich it is Suffered to cool, 2 or three hours, when the earth and\r\ngrass are removed. and the roots thus Sweated are cooled with Steam or\r\ntaken out, and most commonly exposed to the Sun on Scaffolds untill\r\nthey become dry. when they are black and of a Sweet agreeable flavor.\r\nthese roots are fit for use when first taken from the pitt, are Soft of\r\na Sweetish taste and much the consistancy of a roasted onion; but if\r\nthey are Suffered to remain in bulk 24 hours after being cooked they\r\nSpoil. if the design is to make bread or cakes of those roots they\r\nundergo a Second preperation of baking being previously pounded after\r\nthe first baking between two Stones untill they are reduced to the\r\nconsistancy of dough and then rolled in grass in cakes of 8 or 10\r\npounds, are returned to the Sweat intermixes with fresh roots in order\r\nthat the steam may get freely to those loaves of bread. when taken out\r\nthe Second time the Indn. woman make up this dough into cakes of\r\nvarious Shapes and Sizes, usually from 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick and\r\nexpose it on sticks to dry in the Sun, or place it over the smoke of\r\ntheir fires.--The bread thus prepared if kept free from moisture will\r\nSound for a great length of time. this bread or the dryed roots are\r\nfrequently eaten alone by the nativs without further preperation, and\r\nwhen they have them in abundance they form an ingrediant in almost\r\nevery dish they prepare. this root is palateable but disagrees with us\r\nin every shape we have ever used it. the nativs are extreemly fond of\r\nthis root and present it their visiters as a great treat. when we first\r\narrived at the Chopunnish last fall at this place our men who were half\r\nStarved made So free a use of this root that it made them all Sick for\r\nSeveral days after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 12, 1806]\r\nThursday June 12th 1806.\r\nAll our hunters except Gibson returned about noon;

Whitehouse\r\nreturned with his horse at 1 P.M. the days are now very warm and the\r\nMusquetoes our old companions have become very troublesome.

The indian who visited us\r\nyesterday exchanged his horse for one of ours which had not perfectly\r\nrecovered from the operation of castration and received a small ax and\r\na knife to boot, he seemed much pleased with his exchange and set out\r\nimmediately to his village, as if fearfull that we would cansel the\r\nbargain which is customary among themselves and deemed only fair. we\r\ndirected the meat to be cut thin and exposed to dry in the sun. we made\r\na digest of the Indian Nations West of the Rocky Mountains which we\r\nhave seen and of whom we have been repeated informed by those with whom\r\nwe were conversent. they amount by our estimate to 69,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 13, 1806]\r\nFriday June 13th 1806.\r\nOrdered Rubin Fields and Willard to proceed on to a Small prarie in the\r\nMountains about 8 miles and there hunt untill we arrive the Set out at\r\n10 A.M.

Fields & Willard on Collin's Creek, they arrived at\r\nthis Creek last evening and had killed another Deer near the Creek.\r\nhere we let our horses graze in a Small glade and took dinner. the rain\r\nSeased and Sun Shown out. after detaining about 2 hours we proceeded on\r\npassing the Creek three times and passing over Some ruged hills or\r\nSpurs of the rocky Mountain, passing the Creek on which I encamped on\r\nthe 17th Septr. last to a Small glade of about 10 acres thickly Covered\r\nwith grass and quawmash, near a large Creek and encamped. we passed\r\nthrough bad fallen timber and a high Mountain this evening. from the\r\ntop of this Mountain I had an extensive view of the rocky Mountains to\r\nthe South and the Columbian plains for great extent also the S W.\r\nMountains and a range of high Mountains which divides the waters of\r\nLewis's & Clarks rivers and seems to termonate nearly a West Cours.\r\nSeveral high pts. to the N & N. E. Covered with Snow. a remarkable high\r\nrugd mountain in the forks of Lewis's river nearly South and covered\r\nwith Snow. The vally up the Chopunnish river appears extensive\r\ntolerably leavel and Covered with timber. The S W.

E. about seven\r\nmiles when we arrived at a small branch of hungry creek. the difficulty\r\nwe met with from the fallen timber detained us untill 11 oC before we\r\nreached this place. here is a handsome little glade in which we found\r\nsome grass for our horses we therefore halted to let them graize and\r\ntook dinner knowing that there was no other convenient situation for\r\nthat purpose short of the glaids on hungry creek where we intended to\r\nencamp, as the last probable place, at which we shall find a sufficient\r\nquantity of grass for many days. this morning Windsor busted his rifle\r\nnear the muzzle. before we reached this little branch on which we dined\r\nwe saw in the hollows and N. hillsides large quatities of snow yet\r\nundisolved; in some places it was from two to three feet deep.\r\nvegetation is proportionably backward; the dogtooth violet is just in\r\nblume, the honeysuckle, huckburry and a small speceis of white maple\r\nare begining to put fourth their leaves; these appearances in this\r\ncomparatively low region augers but unfavourably with rispect to the\r\npractibility of passing the mountains, however we determined to\r\nproceed, accordingly after taking a haisty meal we set out and\r\ncontinued our rout though a thick wood much obstructed with fallen\r\ntimber, and intersepted by many steep ravines and high hills. the snow\r\nhas increased in quantity so much that the greater part of our rout\r\nthis evening was over the snow which has become sufficiently firm to\r\nbear our horshes, otherwise it would have been impossible for us to\r\nproceed as it lay in immence masses in some places 8 or ten feet deep.\r\nwe found much difficulty in pursuing the road as it was so frequently\r\ncovered with snow. we arrived early in the evening at the place that\r\nCapt. C. had killed and left the flesh of a horse for us last\r\nSeptember. here is a small glade in which there was some grass, not a\r\nsufficiency for our horses but we thought it most advisable to remain\r\nhere all night as we apprehended if we proceeded further we should find\r\nless grass. the air is pleasent in the course of the day but becomes\r\nvery cold before morning notwithstanding the shortness of the nights.\r\nHungry creek is but small at this place but is deep and runs a perfect\r\ntorrent; the water is perfectly transparent and as cold as ice. the\r\npitch pine, white pine some larch and firs constite the timber; the\r\nlong leafed pine extends a little distance on this side of the main\r\nbranch of Collins's creek, and the white cedar not further than the\r\nbranch of hungry creek on which we dined. I killed a small brown\r\npheasant today, it feeds on the tender leaves and buds of the fir and\r\npitch pine. in the fore part of the day I observed the Cullumbine the\r\nblue bells and the yelow flowering pea in blume. there is an abundance\r\nof a speceis of anjelico in these mountains, much stonger to the taist\r\nand more highly scented than that speceis common to the U States. know\r\nof no particular virtue or property it possesses; the natives dry it\r\ncut it in small peices which they string on a small cord and place\r\nabout their necks; it smells very pleasantly. we came 15 miles today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 16, 1806]\r\nMonday June 16th 1806\r\nCollected our horses early and Set Out 7 A M proceeded on up the Creek\r\nthrough a gladey Swompy bottom with grass and quawmash Crossed the\r\nCreek to the East and proceeded on through most intolerable bad fallen\r\ntimber over a high Mountain on which great quantity of Snow is yet\r\nlying premisquissly through the thick wood, and in maney places the\r\nbanks of snow is 4 feet deep. we noned it or dined on a Small Creek in\r\na small open Vally where we found Some grass for our horses to eate,\r\naltho Serounded by Snow no other Convenient Situation Short of the\r\nglades on Hungery Creek where we intended to encamp, as the last\r\nprobable place, at which we Shall find a Sufficent quantity of grass\r\nfor maney days. This morning Windsor bursted his rifle near the Muzzle.\r\nVigitation is propotionable backward; the dog tooth Violet is just in\r\nblume, the honeysuckle, huckleberry and a Small Species of white maple\r\nare beginning to put foth their leaves, where they are clear of the\r\nSnow, those appearances in this comparratively low region augers but\r\nunfavourably with respect to the practibility of passing the Mountains,\r\nhowever we deturmine to proceed, accordingly after takeing a hasty meal\r\nwe Set out and Continued our rout through a thick wood much obstructed\r\nwith fallen timber, and interupted by maney Steep reveins and hills\r\nwhich wer very high. the Snow has increased in quantity So much that\r\nthe great part of our rout this evening was over the Snow which has\r\nbecome Sufficently firm to bear our horses, otherwise it would have\r\nbeen impossible for us to proceed as it lay in emince masses in Some\r\nplaces 8 or ten feet deep. We found much dificulty in finding the road,\r\nas it was So frequently covered with Snow. we arived early in the\r\nevening at the place I had killed and left the flesh of a horse for the\r\nparty in my rear last Septr. here is a Small glade in which there is\r\nSome grass, not a Sufficency of our horses, but we thought it\r\nadviseable to remain here all night as we apprehended if we proceeded\r\nfurther we should find less grass. The air is pleasant in the Course of\r\nthe day, but becomes very cold before morning not withstanding the\r\nShortness of the night. Hungary Creek is but Small at this place but is\r\ndeep and runs a perfect torrent; the water is perfectly transparent and\r\nas Cold as ice. the titch pine, white pine Some Larch and firs consists\r\nthe timber, the long leafed pine extends but a Short distance on the\r\nMts. Capt. L. killed a Small brown pheasant today, it feeds on the\r\ntender leaves and buds of the fir and pitch pine. in the forepart of\r\nthe day I observed the Cullumbine the blue bells and the Yellow\r\nflowering pea in blume. there is an abundance of a Species of Anjelico\r\nin the mountains much Stronger to the taiste, and more highly Scented\r\nthan that Species common to the U States. I know of no particular\r\nvirtue or property it possesses the nativs dry it Cut it in Small\r\npieces which they string on a Small Cord and place about the necks; it\r\nSmells pleasently. we Come 15 Ms. today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 17, 1806]\r\nTuesday June 17th 1806.\r\nwe collected our horses and set out early; we proceeded down hungry\r\ncreek about seven miles passing it twice; we found it difficult and\r\ndangerous to pass the creek in consequence of its debth and rapidity;\r\nwe avoided two other passes of the creek by ascending a very steep\r\nrocky and difficult hill. beyond this creek the road ascends the\r\nmountain to the hight of the main leading ridges which divides the\r\nWaters of the Chopunnish and Kooskooske rivers. this hill or reather\r\nmountain we ascended about 3 miles when we found ourselves invelloped\r\nin snow from 12 to 15 feet deep even on the south sides of the hills\r\nwith the fairest exposure to the sun; here was winter with all it's\r\nrigors; the air was cold, my hands and feet were benumbed. we knew that\r\nit would require five days to reach the fish wears at the entrance of\r\nColt Creek, provided we were so fortunate as to be enabled to follow\r\nthe proper ridges of the mountains to lead us to that place; short of\r\nthat point we could not hope for any food for our horses not even\r\nunderwood itself as the whole was covered many feet deep in snow. if we\r\nproceeded and should get bewildered in these mountains the certainty\r\nwas that we should loose all our horses and consequently our baggage\r\ninstruments perhaps our papers and thus eminently wrisk the loss of the\r\ndiscoveries which we had already made if we should be so fortunate as\r\nto escape with life. the snow boar our horses very well and the\r\ntravelling was therefore infinitely better that the obstruction of\r\nrocks and fallen timber which we met with in our passage over last fall\r\nwhen the snow lay on this part of the ridge in detached spots only.\r\nunder these circumstances we conceived it madnes in this stage of the\r\nexpedition to proceed without a guide who could certainly conduct us to\r\nthe fish wears on the Kooskooske, as our horses could not possibly\r\nsustain a journey of more than five days without food. we therefore\r\ncame to the resolution to return with our horses while they were yet\r\nstrong and in good order and indevour to keep them so untill we could\r\nprocure an indian to conduct us over the snowey mountains, and again to\r\nproceed as soon as we could procure such a guide, knowing from the\r\nappearance of the snows that if we remained untill it had desolved\r\nsufficiently for us to follow the road that we should not be enabled to\r\nreturn to the United States within this season. having come to this\r\nresolution, we ordered the party to make a deposit for all the baggage\r\nwhich we had not immediate use for, and also all the roots and bread of\r\ncows which they had except an allowance for a few days to enable them\r\nto return to some place at which we could subsist by hunting untill we\r\nprocured a guide. we left our instruments papers &c beleiving them\r\nsafer here than to wrisk them on horseback over the roads and creeks\r\nwhich we had passed. our baggage being laid on scaffoalds and well\r\ncovered we began our retrograde march at 1 P.M. having remained about 3\r\nhours on this snowey mountain. we returned by the rout we had come to\r\nhungry creek, which we ascended about 2 miles and encamped. we had here\r\nmore grass for our horses than the preceeding evening yet it was but\r\nscant. the party were a good deel dejected tho not so as I had\r\napprehended they would have been. this is the first time since we have\r\nbeen on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or\r\nmake a retrograde march. it rained on us most of this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 17, 1806]\r\nTuesday June 17th 1806\r\nWe Collected our horses and Set out early; we proceeded down hungary\r\nCreek about 7 miles passing it twice; we found it dificuelt and\r\ndangerous to pass the creek in consequence of it's debth and rapidity;\r\nwe avoided two other passes of the creek, by assending a Steep rockey\r\nand difficuelt hill. beyond this Creek the road assends the mountain to\r\nthe hight of the main leading ridges, which divides the waters of the\r\nKooskooske and Chopunnish Riv's. This mountain we ascended about 3\r\nmiles when we found ourselves invelloped in snow from 8 to 12 feet deep\r\neven on the South Side of the mountain. I was in front and Could only\r\nprosue the derection of the road by the trees which had been peeled by\r\nthe nativs for the iner bark of which they Scraped and eate, as those\r\npealed trees were only to be found Scattered promisquisley, I with\r\ngreat difficulty prosued the direction of the road one mile further to\r\nthe top of the mountain where I found the Snow from 12 to 15 feet deep,\r\nbut fiew trees with the fairest exposure to the Sun; here was Winter\r\nwith all it's rigors; the air was Cold my hands and feet were benumed.\r\nwe knew that it would require four days to reach the fish weare at the\r\nenterance of Colt Creek, provided we were So fortunate as to be enabled\r\nto follow the poper ridge of the mountains to lead us to that place; of\r\nthis all of our most expert woodsmen and principal guides were\r\nextreemly doubtfull; Short of that point we could not hope for any food\r\nfor our horses not even under wood itself as the whole was covered many\r\nfeet deep in Snow. if we proceeded and Should git bewildered in those\r\nMountains the Certainty was that we Should lose all of our horses and\r\nconsequencely our baggage enstrements perhaps our papers and thus\r\neventially resque the loss of our discoveries which we had already made\r\nif we Should be So fortunate as to escape with life. the Snow bore our\r\nhorses very well and the traveling was therefore infinately better than\r\nthe obstruction of rocks and fallen timber which we met with in our\r\npassage over last fall when the Snow lay on this part of the ridge in\r\ndetached spops only. under these Circumstances we Conceived it madness\r\nin this stage of the expedition to proceed without a guide who Could\r\nCertainly Conduct us to the fishwears on the Kooskooske, as our horses\r\ncould not possibly Sustain a journey of more than 4 or 5 days without\r\nfood. we therefore Come to the resolution to return with our horses\r\nwhile they were yet strong and in good order, and indeaver to keep them\r\nSo untill we could precure an indian to conduct us over the Snowey\r\nMountains, and again to proceed as soon as we could precure Such a\r\nguide, knowing from the appearance of the snows that if we remained\r\nuntill it had disolved Sufficiently for us to follow the road that we\r\nShould not be enabled to return to the United States within this\r\nSeason. having come to this resolution, we ordered the party to make a\r\ndeposit of all the baggage which we had not imediate use for, and also\r\nall the roots and bread of Cows which they had except an allowance for\r\na fiew days to enable them to return to Some place at which we could\r\nSubsist by hunting untill we precured a guide. we left our instrements,\r\nand I even left the most of my papers believing them Safer here than to\r\nWrisk them on horseback over the road, rocks and water which we had\r\npassed. our baggage being laid on Scaffolds and well covered, we began\r\nour retragrade march at 1 P.M. haveing remain'd about three hours on\r\nthis Snowey mountain. we returned by the rout we had advanced to\r\nhungary Creek, which we assended about 2 miles and encamped. we had\r\nhere more grass for our horses than the proceeding evening, yet it was\r\nbut scant. the party were a good deel dejected, tho not as much So as I\r\nhad apprehended they would have been. this is the first time Since we\r\nhave been on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat\r\nor make a retragrade march. it rained on us the most of this evening.\r\non the top of the Mountain the Weather was very fluctiating and\r\nuncertain snowed cloudy & fair in a few minets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 18, 1806]\r\nWednesday June 18th 1806.\r\nThis morning we had considerable difficulty in collecting our horses\r\nthey having straggled off to a considerable distance in surch of food\r\non the sides of the mountains among the thick timber; at 9 OCk. we\r\ncollected them all except one of Drewyers and one of Sheildes; we set\r\nout leaving Sheilds and LaPage to collect the two lost horses and\r\nfollow us. We dispatched Drewyer and Shannon to the Chopunnish Indians\r\nin the plains beyond the Kooskooske in order to hasten the arrival of\r\nthe indians who had promised to accompany us or to procure a gude at\r\nall events and rejoin us as soon as possible. we sent by them a rifle\r\nwhich we offered as a reward to any of them who would engage to conduct\r\nus to traveller's rest; we also dirrected them if they found difficulty\r\nin induciny any of them to accompany us to offer the reward of two\r\nother guns to be given them immediately and ten horses at the falls of\r\nMissouri. we had not proceeded far this morning before Potts cut his\r\nleg very badly with one of the large knives; he cut one of the large\r\nveigns on the inner side of the leg; I found much difficulty in stoping\r\nthe blood which I could not effect untill I applyed a tight bandage\r\nwith a little cushon of wood and tow on the veign below the wound.\r\nColter's horse fel with him in passing hungry creek and himself and\r\nhorse were driven down the creek a considerable distance rolling over\r\neach other among the rocks. he fortunately escaped without injury or\r\nthe loss of his gun. by 1 P.M. we returned to the glade on the branch\r\nof hungry Creek where we had dined on the 16th inst. here we again\r\nhalted and dined. as there was much appearance of deer about this place\r\nwe left R. and J. Feilds with directions to hunt this evening and\r\ntomorrow morning at this place and to join us in the evening at the\r\nmeadows of Collin's creek where we intend remaining tomorrow in order\r\nto rest our horses and hunt. after dinner we proceeded on to Collin's\r\nCreek and encamped in a pleasant situation at the upper part of the\r\nmeadows about 2 ms. above our encampment of the 15th inst. we sent out\r\nseveral hunters but they returned without having killed anything. they\r\nsaw a number of salmon in the creek and shot at them several times\r\nwithout success. we directed Colter and Gibson to fix each of them a\r\ngigg in the morning and indevour to take some of the salmon. the\r\nhunters saw much fresh appearance of bear but very little of deer. we\r\nhope by means of the fish together with what deer and bear we can kill\r\nto be enabled to subsist untill our guide arrives without the necessity\r\nof returning to the quawmash flats. there is a great abundance of good\r\nfood here to sustain our horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 18, 1806]\r\nWednesday June 18th 1806\r\nThis morning we had considerable dificuelty in collecting our horses\r\nthey haveing Strageled of to a considerable distance in Serch of food\r\non the Sides of the mountains among the thick timber, at 9 oClock we\r\nCollected them all except 2 one of Shields & one of Drewyer's. we Set\r\nout leaving Shields and LePage to collect the two lost horses and\r\nfollow us.\r\n\r\nWe dispatched Drewyer and Shannon to the Chopunnish Indians in the\r\nplains beyond the Kooskooske in order to hasten the arrival of the\r\nIndians who promised to accompany us, or to precure a guide at all\r\nevents and rejoin us as Soon as possible. We Sent by them a riffle\r\nwhich we offered as a reward to any of them who would engage to conduct\r\nus to Clarks river at the entrance of Travellers rest Creek; we also\r\ndirected them if they found difficuelty in induceing any of them to\r\naccompany us to offer the reward of two other guns to be given them\r\nimmediately and ten horses at the falls of Missouri. we had not\r\nproceeded far this morning before J. Potts cut his leg very badly with\r\none of the large knives; he cut one of the large veins on the iner side\r\nof the leg; Colters horse fell with him in passing hungary creek and\r\nhimself and horse were driven down the Creek a considerable distance\r\nroleing over each other among the rocks. he fortunately escaped without\r\nmuch injurey or the loss of his gun. he lost his blanket. at 1 P. M we\r\nreturned to the glade on a branch of hungary Creek where we had dined\r\non the 16th instant. here we again halted and dined. as there was some\r\nappearance of deer about this place we left J. & R Field with\r\ndirections to hunt this evening and tomorrow morning at this place and\r\njoin us in the evening in the Meadows on Collin's Creek where we\r\nintended to remain tomorrow in order to restour horses and hunt. after\r\ndinner we proceeded on to the near fork of Collins Creek and encamped\r\nin a pleasant Situation at the upper part of the Meadows about 2 miles\r\nabove our encampment of the 15th inst. we Sent out Several hunters but\r\nthey returned without having killed any thing-. they saw a number of\r\nlarge fish in the Creek and Shot at them Several times without\r\nSuckcess. we Gibson and Colter to fix each of themselves a gigg in the\r\nmorning and indeaver to take Some of those fish. the hunters Saw much\r\nfresh appearance of Bear, but very little deer Sign. we hope by the\r\nmeans of the fish together with what deer and bear we can kill to been\r\nabled to Subsist untill our guide arives without the necessaty of\r\nreturning to the quawmash flats. there is great abundance of good food\r\nhere to Sustain our horses. we are in flattering expectations of the\r\narrival of two young chiefs who informed us that they intended to\r\naccompany us to the U. States, and Should Set out from their village in\r\n9 nights after we left them on the 19th inst. if they Set out at that\r\ntime Drewyer & Shannon will meet them, and probably join us on the 20th\r\nor 21st-. Musquetors Troublesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 19, 1806]\r\nThursday June 19th 1806.\r\nOur hunters were out very early this morning, they returned before noon\r\nwith one deer only. the Fishermen had been more unsuccessfull, they\r\nreturned without a single fish and reported they could find but few and\r\nthose they had tryed to take in vain. they had broke both their giggs\r\nwhich were of indian fabrication made of bone. I happened to have a\r\npointed peice of iron in my pouch which answered by cuting in two\r\npeices to renew boath giggs. they took one fish this evening which\r\nproved to be a salmon trout much to our mortification, for we had hoped\r\nthat they were the salmon of this spring arrival and of course fat and\r\nfine. these trout are of the red kind they remain all winter in the\r\nupper parts of the rivers and creeks and are generally poor at this\r\nseason. At 2 P.M. J & R Feilds arived with two deer; John Sheilds and\r\nLaPage came with them, they had not succeeded in finding their horses.\r\nlate in the evening Frazier reported that my riding horse that of Capt\r\nClark and his mule had gone on towards the Quawmash flatts and that he\r\nhad pursued their tracks on the road about 21/2 miles. we determined to\r\nsend out all the hunters in the morning in order to make a fair\r\nexperiment of the pactability of our being able to subsist at this\r\nplace and if not we shall move the day after to the Quawmash flatts.\r\nthe musquetoes have been excessively troublesome to us since our\r\narrival at this place particularly in the evening. Cruzatte brought me\r\nseveral large morells which I roasted and eat without salt pepper or\r\ngrease in this way I had for the first time the true taist of the\r\nmorell which is truly an insippid taistless food. our stock of salt is\r\nnow exhausted except two quarts which I have reserved for my tour up\r\nMaria's River and that I left the other day on the mountain.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 19, 1806]\r\nThursday June 19th 1806\r\nThis morning early Collins Labeesh & Crusat turned out to hunt, and\r\nGibson & Colter fixed two Indian giggs and went in Serch of fish in the\r\nCreek. I took my gun and walked up the Creek about 4 Miles Saw some\r\nbear Sign and one fish only. Gibson killed only one fish which we found\r\nto be the Salmon Trout of the dark Species. this fish was of the common\r\nSize pore, and indifferently flavoured. Labeesh killed one Deer neither\r\nof the others killed any thing. about 1 P.M. Jo. & R Fields Shields &\r\nLaPage came up. Reubin &Joseph Fields brought two Deer which R. had\r\nkilled in the Small glade on a branch of Hungary Creek where we had\r\nleft them yesterday. Shields & LaPage did not find the two horses which\r\nwe lost yesterday morning. they report that they hunted with great\r\ndiligence in the vicinity of our camp of the 17th without suckcess. in\r\nmy walk of this day up the Creek I observed a great abundance of fine\r\ngrass sufficient to Sustain our horses any length of time we chose to\r\nStay at this place. Several glades of quawmash. the S W. Sides of the\r\nhills is fallen timber and burnt woods, the N. E. Sides of the hills is\r\nthickly timbered with lofty pine, and thick under growth This evening\r\nSeveral Salmon trout were Seen in the Creek, they hid themselves under\r\nthe banks of the Creek which jutted over in Such a manner as to secure\r\nthem from the Stroke of our giggs nets and spears which were made for\r\nthe purpose of taking those Salmon trout. we concluded to delay at this\r\nplace another day with a view to give time to the two young Chiefs to\r\narrive in case they set out on the 19th inst. as they informed us they\r\nShould they will have Sufficient time to join us tomorrow or early the\r\nnext day. Should we get a guide from this place it will Save us two\r\ndays march through some of the worst road through those Mountains,\r\ncrouded with fallin timber mud holes and steep hills &c. we directed\r\nall the hunters to turn out early and kill something for us to live on\r\n&c. Musquetors troublesom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 20, 1806]\r\nFriday June 20th 1806.\r\nOur hunters set out early this morning; most of them returned before\r\nnoon. R. Feilds killed a brown bear the tallons of which were\r\nremarkably short broad at their base and sharply pointed this was of\r\nthe speceis which the Chopunnish call Yah-kar. it was in very low order\r\nand the flesh of the bear in this situation is much inferior to lean\r\nvenison or the flesh of poor Elk. Labush and Cruzatte returned late in\r\nthe evening with one deer which the former had killed. we also caught\r\nseven salmon trout in the course of the day. the hunters assured us\r\nthat their greatest exertions would not enable them to support us here\r\nmore than one or two days longer from the great scarcity of game and\r\nthe difficult access of the country, the under brush being very thick\r\nand great quantities of fallen timber. as we shall necessarily be\r\ncompelled to remain more than two days for the return of Drewyer and\r\nShannon we determined to return in the morning as far as the quawmash\r\nflatts and indeavour to lay in another stock of meat for the mountains,\r\nour former stock being now nearly exhausted as well as what we have\r\nkilled on our return. by returning to the quawmash flatts we shall\r\nsooner be informed whether or not we can procure a guide to conduct us\r\nthrough the mountains; should we fail in procuring one, we have\r\ndetermined to wrisk a passage on the following plan immediately,\r\nbecause should we wait much longer or untill the snow desolves in such\r\nmanner as to enable us to follow the road we cannot hope to reach the\r\nUnited States this winter; this is that Capt. C. or myself shall take\r\nfour of our most expert woodsmen with three or four of our best horses\r\nand proceed two days in advance taking a plentiful) supply of\r\nprovision. for this party to follow the road by the marks which the\r\nbaggage of the indians has made in many places on the sides of the\r\ntrees by rubing against them, and to blaize the trees with a tomahawk\r\nas they proceeded. that after proceeding two days in advance of hungary\r\ncreek two of those men would be sent back to the main party who by the\r\ntime of their return to Hungary Creek would have reached that place.\r\nthe men so returning would be enabled to inform the main party of the\r\nprobable success of the preceeding party in finding the road and of\r\ntheir probable progress, in order that should it be necessary, the main\r\nparty by the delay of a day or two at hungary creek, should give the\r\nadvance time to mark the road through before the main party could\r\novertake them, and thus prevent delay on the part of the rout where no\r\nfood is to be obtained for our horses. should it so happen that the\r\nadvance could not find the road by the marks on the trees after\r\nattempting it for two days, the whole of then would return to the main\r\nparty. in which case we wold bring back our baggage and attempt a\r\npassage over these mountains through the country of the Shoshones\r\nfurther to the South by way of the main S. Westerly fork of Lewis's\r\nriver and Madison or Gallatin's rivers, where from the information of\r\nthe Chopunnish there is a passage which at this season of the year is\r\nnot obstructed by snow, though the round is very distant and would\r\nrequire at least a month in it's performance. The Shoshones informed us\r\nwhen we first met with them that there was a passage across the\r\nmountains in that quarter but represented the difficulties arrising\r\nfrom steep high and rugged mountains and also an extensive and barren\r\nplain which was to be passed without game, as infinitely more difficult\r\nthan the rout by which we came. from the circumstance of the Chopunnish\r\nbeing at war with that part of the Shoshones who inhabit the country on\r\nthis side of the Mountains through which the road passes I think it is\r\nhighly probable that they cannot be well informed with rispect to the\r\nroad, and further, had there been a better road in that quarter the\r\nShoshones on the East fork of Lewis's river who knew them both would\r\nnot have recommended that by which we came to this country. the\r\ntravelling in the mountains on the snow at present is very good, the\r\nsnow bears the horses perfictly; it is a firm coase snow without a\r\ncrust, and the horses have good foot hold without sliping much; the\r\nonly dificulty is finding the road, and I think the plan we have\r\ndevised will succeed even should we not be enabled to obtain a guide.\r\nAlthough the snow may be stated on an average at 10 feet deep yet\r\narround the bodies of the trees it has desolved much more than in other\r\nparts not being generally more than one or two feet deep immediately at\r\nthe roots of the trees, and; of course the marks left by the rubing of\r\nthe indian baggage against them is not concealed. the reason why the\r\nsnow is comparitively so shallow about the roots of the trees I presume\r\nproceeds as well from the snow in falling being thrown off from their\r\nbodies by their thick and spreading branches as from the reflection of\r\nthe sun against the trees and the warmth which they in some measure\r\nacquire from the earth which is never frozen underneath these masses of\r\nsnow. Bratton's horse was also discovered to be absent this evening. I\r\npresume he has also returned to the flatts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 20, 1806]\r\nFriday June 20th 1806\r\nThe hunters turned out early in different directions, our guiggers also\r\nturned out with 2 guigs a Bayonet fixed on a pole, a Scooping nett and\r\na Snar made of horse. near the ford of the Creek in a deep hole we\r\nkilled Six Salmon trout & 2 others were killed in the Creek above in\r\nthe evening. Reubin Field killed a redish brown bear which was very\r\nmeagure. the tallons of this bear was remarkably Short broad at their\r\nbase and Sharply pointed, this was of the Species the Chopunnish call\r\nYahkar. as it was in very low order the flesh was indifferent. Labiesh\r\n& Crusat returned late in the evening with one deer which the former\r\nhad killed. the hunters assured us that, their greatest exertions would\r\nnot enable them to support us here more than one or two days longer,\r\nfrom the great scercity of game and the dificuelt access of the\r\nCountry, the under brush being very thick and great quantities of\r\nfallen timber. as we shall necessarily be compelled to remain more than\r\ntwo days for the return of Drewyer & Shannon we determine to return in\r\nthe morning as far as the quawmash flatts, and endeaver to lay in\r\nanother Stock of meat for the mountains, our former Stock now being\r\nnearly exhosted as well as what we have killed on our rout. by\r\nreturning to the quawmash flatts we Shall Sooner be informed wheather\r\nor not we can precure a guide to conduct us through the Mountains;\r\nShould we fail in precureing one, we are deturmined to wrisk a passage\r\non the following plan immediately, because Should we wait much longer,\r\nor untill the Snow disolves in Such manner as to enable us to follow\r\nthe road we cannot expect to reach the U States this Winter; this is\r\nthat Capt. L. or myself shall take four of our most expert woods men\r\nwith 3 or four of our best horses and proceed two days in advance\r\ntakeing a plentiful Supply of provisions. for this party to follow the\r\nroad by the mark the indins have made in many places with their baggage\r\non the Sides of the trees by rubbing against them, and to blaize the\r\ntrees with a tomahawk as they proceed. that after proceeding two days\r\nin advance of Hungary Creek, two of those men would be sent back to the\r\nparty who by the time of their return to hungary Creek would have\r\nreached that place. the men So returning would be enabled to inform the\r\nmain party of the probable Suckcess of the proceeding party in finding\r\nthe road and of their probable progress, in order that Should it be\r\nnecessary, the main party by a delay of a day or two a hungary Creek,\r\nshould give the advance time to make the road through before the main\r\nparty could overtake them, and thus prevent delay on that part of the\r\nrout where no food is to be obtained for our horses. Should it So\r\nhappen that the advance Should not find the road by the marks of the\r\ntrees after attempting it for two days, the whole of them would return\r\nto the main party. in which Case we would bring back our baggage and\r\nattempt a passage over the Mountains through the Country of the\r\nShoshones further to the South, by way of the main S Westerly fork of\r\nLewis's river and Madisons or Gallitins river's, where from the\r\ninformation of the Chopunnish, there is a passage where at this season\r\nof the year is not obstructed by snow, though the round is very distant\r\nand would require at least a month in it's preformance. The Shoshones\r\ninformed us when we first met with them that there was a passage across\r\nthe Mountains in that quarter but represented the difficuelties\r\narriseing from Steep ruggid high mountains, and also an extensive and\r\nbarren plain which was to be passed without game, as infinitely more\r\ndifficuelt than the rout by which we Came. from the Circumstance of the\r\nChopunnish being at war with that part of the Shoshones who inhabit the\r\nCountry on this side of the Mountains through which the road passes, I\r\nthink it is highly probable they cannot be well informed with respect\r\nto the road, and further, had there been a better road in that quarter\r\nthe Shoshones on the East fork of Lewis's river who knew them boath\r\nwould not have recommend'd that by which we came to this country. The\r\ntravelling in the Mountains on the Snow, at present is very good, the\r\nSnow bears the horses perfectly; it is a firm coase Snow without a\r\ncrust, and the horses have good foot hold without slipping much; the\r\nonly dificuelty is finding the road, and I think the plan we have\r\ndevised will Suckceed even Should we not be enabled to obtain a guide.\r\naltho the Snow may be Stated on an average at 10 feet deep, yet arround\r\nthe body of the trees it has disolved much more than in other parts,\r\nnot being generally more than one or two feet deep imediately at the\r\nroots of the trees, and of course the marks made by the rubbing of the\r\nIndian baggage against them is not Concealed. The reason why the Snow\r\nis comparitively So Shallow about the roots of the trees, 1 prosume\r\nproceeds as well from the Snow in falling being thrown off from their\r\nbodies by the thick and Spreading branches, as from the reflection of\r\nthe Sun against the trees and the warmth which they in Some measure\r\nacquire from the earth which is never frozen underneath those masses of\r\nSnow. 4 of our horses are absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 21, 1806]\r\nSaturday June 21st 1806.\r\nWe collected our horses early set out on our return to the flatts. we\r\nall felt some mortification in being thus compelled to retrace our\r\nsteps through this tedious and difficult part of our rout, obstructed\r\nwith brush and innumerable logs of fallen timber which renders the\r\ntraveling distressing and even dangerous to our horses. one of\r\nThompson's horses is either choked this morning or has the distemper\r\nvery badly I fear he is to be of no further service to us. an excellent\r\nhorse of Cruzatte's snagged himself so badly in the groin in jumping\r\nover a parsel of fallen timber that he will evidently be of no further\r\nservice to us. at the pass of Collin's Creek we met two indians who\r\nwere on their way over the mountain; they had brought with them the\r\nthree horses and the mule that had left us and returned to the quawmash\r\ngrounds. these indians returned with us about 1/2 a mile down the creek\r\nwhere we halted to dine and graize our horses at the same place I had\r\nhalted and remained all night with the party on the ____ of Septembr\r\nlast. as well as we could understand the indians they informed us that\r\nthey had seen Drewyer and Shannon and that they would not return untill\r\nthe expiration of two days; the cause why Drewyer and Shannon had not\r\nreturned with these men we are at a loss to account for. we pressed\r\nthese indians to remain with us and to conduct us over the mountain on\r\nthe return of Drewyer and Shannon. they consented to remain two nights\r\nfor us and accordingly deposited their store of roots and bread in the\r\nbushes at no great distance and after dinner returned with us, as far\r\nas the little prarie about 2 miles distant from the creek, here they\r\nhalted with their horses and informed us they would remain untill we\r\novertook them or at least two nights. they had four supenumery horses\r\nwith them. we sent on four hunters a head to the quawmash flatts to\r\ntake an evenings hunt; they so far succeeded as to kill one deer. we\r\nleft Reubin and J.

E. of hungary Creek. here we necessarily halted about 2 hours to\r\narrange our baggage and prepare our loads. we cooked and made a haisty\r\nmeal of boiled venison and mush of cows. the snow has subsided near\r\nfour feet since the 17th inst. we now measured it accurately and found\r\nfrom a mark which we had made on a tree when we were last here on the\r\n17th that it was then 10 feet 10 inches which appeared to be about the\r\ncommon debth though it is deeper still in some places. it is now\r\ngenerally about 7 feet. on our way up this mountain about the border of\r\nthe snowey region we killed 2 of the small black pheasant and a female\r\nof the large dommanicker or speckled pheasant, the former have 16\r\nfathers in their tail and the latter 20 while the common pheasant have\r\nonly 18. the indians informed us that neither of these speceis drumed;\r\nthey appear to be very silent birds for I never heared either of them\r\nmake a noise in any situation. the indians haistened to be off and\r\ninformed us that it was a considerable distance to the place which they\r\nwished to reach this evening where there was grass for our horses.\r\naccordingly we set out with our guides who lead us over and along the\r\nsteep sides of tremendious mountains entirely covered with snow except\r\nabout the roots of the trees where the snow had sometimes melted and\r\nexposed a few square feet of the earth. we ascended and decended\r\nseverall lofty and steep hights but keeping on the dividing ridge\r\nbetween the Chopunnish and Kooskooske rivers we passed no stream of\r\nwater. late in the evening much to the satisfaction of ourselves and\r\nthe comfort of our horses we arrived at the desired spot and encamped\r\non the steep side of a mountain convenient to a good spring. having\r\npassed a few miles our camp of 18 Sepr 1805 here we found an abundance\r\nof fine grass for our horses. this situation was the side of an\r\nuntimbered mountain with a fair southern aspect where the snows from\r\nappearance had been desolved about 10 days. the grass was young and\r\ntender of course and had much the appearance of the greenswoard. there\r\nis a great abundance of a speceis of bear-grass which grows on every\r\npart of these mountains it's growth is luxouriant and continues green\r\nall winter but the horses will not eat it. soon after we had encamped\r\nwe were overtaken by a Chopunnish man who had pursued us with a view to\r\naccompany me to the falls of the Missouri. we were now informed that\r\nthe two young men whom we met on the 21st and detained several days are\r\ngoing on a party of pleasure mearly to the Oote-lash-shoots or as they\r\ncall them Sha-lees a band of the Tush-she-pah nation who reside on\r\nClark's river in the neighbourhood of traveller's rest. one of our\r\nguides lost 2 of his horses, which he returned in surch of; he found\r\nthem and rejoined us a little before dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 26, 1806]\r\nThursday June 26th 1806\r\nWe collected our horses and Set out early and proceeded on Down hungary\r\nCreek a fiew miles and assended to the Summit of the mountain where we\r\ndeposited our baggage on the 17th inst. found every thing Safe and as\r\nwe had left them. the Snow which was 10 feet 10 inches deep on the top\r\nof the mountain, had sunk to 7 feet tho perfectly hard and firm. we\r\nmade Some fire Cooked dinner and dined, while our horses Stood on snow\r\n7 feet deep at least. after dinner we packed up and proceeded on. about\r\nthe borders of the Snowey region we killed 2 Small black pheasents and\r\na female of the large dommanicker or Speckled pheasent, the former have\r\n16 feathers in the tail and the latter 20 while the common Pheasent\r\nhave 18. the indians informed us that neither of these Speces drumed;\r\nthey appear to be very Silent birds for I never heard any of them make\r\nany noise. the Indians hastened us off and informed us that it was a\r\nconsiderable distance to the place they wished to reach this evening\r\nwhere there was grass for our horses. accordingly we Set out with our\r\nguides who led us over and along the Steep Sides of tremendious\r\nMountains entirely covered with Snow except about the roots of the\r\ntrees where the Snow was partially melted and exposed a Small Spot of\r\nearth. we assended and decended Several Steep lofty hights but keeping\r\non the dividing ridge of the Chopunnish & Kooskooske river we passed no\r\nStream of water. late in the evening much to the Satisfaction of\r\nourselves and the Comfort of the horses we arived at the desired Spot\r\nand Encamped on the Steep Side of a Mountain Convenient to a good\r\nSpring. here we found an abundance of fine grass for our horses. this\r\nSituation was the Side of an untimbered mountain with a fair Southern\r\naspect where the Snow from appearance had been disolved about 10 days,\r\nthe grass was young and tender of course and had much the appearance of\r\nthe Green Swoard. there is a great abundance of Species of bear grass\r\nwhich grows on every part of those Mountains, its growth is luxurient\r\nand continues green all winter but the horses will not eate it. Soon\r\nafter we had encamped we were over taken by a Chopunnish man who had\r\npursued us with a view to accompany Capt Lewis to the falls of\r\nMissouri. we were now informed that the two young men we met on the\r\n21st and detained Several days were going on a party of pleasure mearly\r\nto the Oat-lash-shoots or as they call them Sha-lees a band of the\r\nTush-she-pah Nation who reside on Clarks river in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Mouth of Travelers rest. one of our Guides lost 2 of his horses, he\r\nreturned in Serch of them he found them & rejoined us at Dark. all of\r\nthe Indians with us have two & 3 horses each. I was taken yesterday\r\nwith a violent pain in my head which has tormented me ever Since, most\r\nviolently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 27, 1806]\r\nFriday June 27th 1806.\r\nWe collected our horses early and set out. the road still continued on\r\nthe heights of the same dividing ridge on which we had traveled\r\nyesterday for nine miles or to our encampment of the 18th of September\r\nlast. about one mile short of this encampment on an elivated point we\r\nhalted by the request of the Indians a few minutes and smoked the pipe.\r\non this eminence the natives have raised a conic mound of stones of 6\r\nor eight feet high and on it's summit erected a pine pole of 15 feet\r\nlong from hence they informed us that when passing over with their\r\nfamiles some of the men were usually sent on foot by the fishery at the\r\nentrance of Colt Creek in order to take fish and again met the main\r\nparty at the Quawmash glade on the head of the Kooskooske river. from\r\nthis place we had an extensive view of these stupendous mountains\r\nprincipally covered with snow like that on which we stood; we were\r\nentirely surrounded by those mountains from which to one unacquainted\r\nwith them it would have seemed impossible ever to have escaped; in\r\nshort without the assistance of our guides I doubt much whether we who\r\nhad once passed them could find our way to Travellers rest in their\r\npresent situation for the marked trees on which we had placed\r\nconsiderable reliance are much fewer and more difficult to find than we\r\nhad apprehended. these fellows are most admireable pilots; we find the\r\nroad wherever the snow has disappeared though it be only for a few\r\nhundred paces. after smoking the pipe and contemplating this seene\r\nsufficient to have damp the sperits of any except such hardy travellers\r\nas we have become, we continued our march and at the distance of 3 ms.\r\ndecended a steep mountain and passed two small branches of the\r\nChopunnish river just above their forks and again ascended the ridge on\r\nwhich we passed several miles and at a distance of 7 ms. arrived at our\r\nencampment of September near which we passed 3 small branches of the\r\nChopunnish river and again ascended to the dividing ridge on which we\r\ncontinued nine miles when the ridge became lower and we arrived at a\r\nsituation very similar to our encampment of the last evening tho the\r\nridge was somewhat higher and the snow had not been so long desolved of\r\ncourse there was but little grass. here we encamped for the night\r\nhaving traveled 28 miles over these mountains without releiving the\r\nhorses from their packs or their having any food. the indians inform us\r\nthat there is an abundance of the mountain sheep or what they call\r\nwhite buffaloe. we saw three black-tailed or mule deer this evening but\r\nwere unable to get a shoot at them. we also saw several tracks of those\r\nanimals in the snow. the indians inform that there is great abundance\r\nof Elk in the vally about the Fishery on the Kooskooske River. our meat\r\nbeing exhausted we issued a pint of bears oil to a mess which with\r\ntheir boiled roots made an agreeable dish. Potts's legg which has been\r\nmuch swolen and inflamed for several days is much better this evening\r\nand gives him but little pain. we applyed the pounded roots and leaves\r\nof the wild ginger & from which he found great relief.--neare our\r\nencampment we saw a great number of the yellow lilly with reflected\r\npetals in blume; this plant was just as forward here at this time as it\r\nwas in the plains on the 10th of may.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 27, 1806]\r\nFriday June 27th 1806\r\nWe collected our horses early and Set out. the road Still Continue on\r\nthe hights of the Dividing ridge on which we had traveled yesterday for\r\n9 Ms. or to our encampment of the 16th Septr. last. about 1 m. Short of\r\nthe encampment we halted by the request of the Guides a fiew minits on\r\nan ellevated point and Smoked a pipe on this eminance the nativs have\r\nraised a conic mound of Stons of 6 or 8 feet high and erected a pine\r\npole of 15 feet long. from hence they informed us that when passing\r\nover with their families some of the men were usually Sent on foot by\r\nthe fishery at the enterance of Colt Creek in order to take fish and\r\nagain meet the party at the quawmash glade on the head of Kooskoske\r\nriver. from this place we had an extencive view of these Stupendeous\r\nMountains principally Covered with Snow like that on which we Stood; we\r\nwere entirely Serounded by those mountains from which to one\r\nunacquainted with them it would have Seemed impossible ever to have\r\nescaped, in short without the assistance of our guides, I doubt much\r\nwhether we who had once passed them could find our way to Travellers\r\nrest in their present Situation for the marked trees on which we had\r\nplaced Considerable reliance are much fewer and more difficuelt to find\r\nthan we had apprehended. those indians are most admireable pilots; we\r\nfind the road wherever the Snow has disappeared tho it be only for a\r\nfiew paces. after haveing Smoked the pipe and Contemplating this Scene\r\nSufficient to have dampened the Spirits of any except Such hardy\r\ntravellers as we have become, we continued our march and at the dist.\r\nOf 3 m. decended a Steep mountain and passed two Small branches of the\r\nChopunnish river just above their fok, and again assend the ridge on\r\nwhich we passed. at the distance of 7 m. arived at our Encampment of\r\n16th Septr. last passed 3 Small branches passed on a dividing ridge\r\nrugid and we arived at a Situation very Similar to our Situation of\r\nlast night tho the ridge was Somewhat higher and the Snow had not been\r\nSo long disolved of course there was but little grass. here we Encamped\r\nfor the night haveing traveled 28 Ms. over these mountains without\r\nreleiveing the horses from their packs or their haveing any food. the\r\nIndians inform us that there is an abundance of the Mountain Sheep, or\r\nwhat they Call white Buffalow on those Mountains. we Saw 3 black tail\r\nor mule deer this evening but were unable to get a Shoot at them. we\r\nalso Saw Several tracks of those animals in the snow. our Meat being\r\nexhosted we issued a point of Bears Oil to a mess which with their\r\nboiled roots made an agreeable dish. Jo. Potts leg which had been much\r\nSwelled and inflaimed for several days is much better this evening and\r\ngivs him but little pain. we applied the poundd root & leaves of wild\r\nginger from which he found great relief. Near our encampment we saw\r\ngreat numbers of the Yellow lilly with reflected petals in blume; this\r\nplant was just as foward here at this time as it was in the plains on\r\nthe 10th of May. My head has not pained me so much to day as yesterday\r\nand last night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 28, 1806]\r\nSaturday June 28th 1806.\r\nThis morning we collected our horses and set out as usual after an\r\nearly breakfast. several of our horses had straggled to a considersble\r\ndistance in surch of food but we were fortunate enough to find them in\r\ngood time they look extreemly gant this morning, however the indians\r\ninformed us that at noon we would arrive at a place where there was\r\ngood food for them. we continued our rout along the dividing ridge\r\npassing one very deep hollow and at the distance of six miles passed\r\nour encampment of the 16 of September last, one and a half miles\r\nfurther we passed the road which leads by the fishery falling in on the\r\nwright immediately on the dividing ridge about eleven O'clock we\r\narrived at an untimbered side of a mountain with a Southern aspect just\r\nabove the fishery here we found an abundance of grass for our horses as\r\nthe Indians had informed us. as our horses were very hungary and much\r\nfatiegued and from information no other place where we could obtain\r\ngrass for them within the reach of this evening's travel we determined\r\nto remain at this place all night having come 13 miles only. the water\r\nwas distant from our encampment we therefore melted snow and used the\r\nwater principally. the whole of the rout of this day was over deep\r\nsnows. we find the traveling on the snow not worse than without it, as\r\nthe easy passage it gives us over rocks and fallen timber fully\r\ncompensate for the inconvenience of sliping, certain it is that we\r\ntravel considerably faster on the snow than without it. the snow sinks\r\nfrom 2 to 3 inches with a hors, is coarse and firm and seems to be\r\nformed of the larger and more dense particles of the snow; the surface\r\nof the snow is reather harder in the morning than after the sun shines\r\non it a few hours, but it is not in that situation so dense as to\r\nprevent the horse from obtaining good foothold. we killed a small black\r\npheasant; this bird is generally found in the snowey region of the\r\nmountains and feeds on the leaves of the pine and fir. there is a\r\nspeceis of small whortleburry common to the hights of the mountains,\r\nand a speceis of grass with a broad succulent leaf which looks not\r\nunlike a flag; of the latter the horses are very fond, but as yet it is\r\ngenerally under the snow or mearly making it's appearance as it\r\nconfined to the upper parts of the highest mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 28, 1806]\r\nSaturday June 28th 1806\r\nThis morning we Colected our horses and Set out as usial after an early\r\nbrackfast. we continued our rout along the dividig ridge over knobs &\r\nthrough deep hollows passed our encampmt of the 14 Sept. last near the\r\nforks of the road leaving the one on which we had Came one leading to\r\nthe fishery to our right imediately on the dividing ridge. at 12 oClock\r\nwe arived at an untimberd side of a mountain with a southern aspect\r\njust above the fishery here we found an abundance of grass for our\r\nhorses as the guids had informed us. as our horses were hungary and\r\nmuch fatiegued and from information no other place where we could\r\nobtain grass for them within the reach of this evening's travel we\r\ndeturmined to remain at this place all night haveing come 13 m. only.\r\nthe water was distant from our Encampment we therefore melted Snow and\r\nused the water. the whole of the rout of this day was over deep Snow.\r\nwe find the travelling on the Snow not worse than without it, as easy\r\npassage it givs us over rocks and fallen timber fully compensates for\r\nthe inconvenience of sliping, certain it is that we travel considerably\r\nfaster on the snow than without it. the Snow Sinks from 2 to 3 inches\r\nwith a horse, is course and firm and seems to be formed of the larger\r\nparticles the surface of the snow sees to be rather harder in the\r\nmorning than after the Sun Shines on it a fiew hours, but it is not in\r\nthat situation so dense as to prevent the horses from obtaining good\r\nfoothold. I killed a Small black pheasant; this bird is generally found\r\nin the Snowey region of the mountains and feeds on the leaves of the\r\npine & fir. there is a Species of Small huckleberry common to the\r\nhights of the mountains, and a Species of grass with a broad succulent\r\nleaf which looks not unlike a flag; of the latter the horses are very\r\nfond, but as yet it is generally under the Snow, or mearly makeing it's\r\nappearance as it confined to the upper part of the highest mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 29, 1806]\r\nSunday June 29th 1806.\r\nWe collected our horses early this morning and set out, having\r\npreviously dispatched Drewyer and R. Fields to the warm springs to\r\nhunt. we pursued the hights of the ridge on which we have been passing\r\nfor several days; it terminated at the distance of 5 ms. from our\r\nencampment and we decended to, and passed the main branch of the\r\nKooskooske 11/2 ms. above the entrance of Quawmash creek wid falls in\r\non the N. E. side. when we decended from this ridge we bid adieu to the\r\nsnow. near the river we fund a deer which the hunters had killed and\r\nleft us. this was a fortunate supply as all our oil was now exhausted\r\nand we were reduced to our roots alone without salt. the Kooskooske at\r\nthis place is about 30 yds. wide and runs with great volocity. the bed\r\nas all the mountain streams is composed of smooth stones. beyond the\r\nriver we ascended a very steep acclivity of a mountain about 2 Miles\r\nand arrived at it's summit where we found the old road which we had\r\npased as we went out, coming in on our wright. the road was now much\r\nplainer and more beaten, which we were informed happened from the\r\ncircumstance of the Ootslashshoots visiting the fishery frequently from\r\nthe vally of Clark's river; tho there was no appearance of there having\r\nbeen here this spring. at noon we arrived at the quawmas flatts on the\r\nCreek of the same name and halted to graize our horses and dine having\r\ntraveled 12 miles. we passed our encampment of the 13th of September at\r\n10 ms. where we halted there is a pretty little plain of about 50 acres\r\nplentifully stocked with quawmash and from apperances this fromes one\r\nof the principal stages or encampments of the indians who pass the\r\nmountains on this road. we found after we had halted that one of our\r\npackhorses with his load and one of my riding horses were left behind.\r\nwe dispatched J. Feilds and Colter in surch of the lost horses. after\r\ndinner we continued our march seven miles further to the warm springs\r\nwhere we arrived early in the evening and sent out several hunters, who\r\nas well as R Fields and Drewyer returned unsuccessful; late in the\r\nevening Colter and J. Fields joined us with the lost horses and brought\r\nwith them a deer which they had killed, this furnished us with supper.\r\nthese warm springs are situated at the base of a hill of no\r\nconsiderable hight on the N side and near the bank of travellers rest\r\ncreek which at that place is about 10 yards wide. these springs issue\r\nfrom the bottoms and through the interstices of a grey freestone rock,\r\nthe rock rises in iregular masy clifts in a circular range arround the\r\nsprings on their lower side. immediately above the springs on the creek\r\nthere is a handsome little quamas plain of about 10 acres. the\r\nprinsipal spring is about the temperature of the warmest baths used at\r\nthe hot springs in Virginia. In this bath which had been prepared by\r\nthe Indians by stoping the run with stone and gravel, I bathed and\r\nremained in 19 minutes, it was with dificulty I could remain thus long\r\nand it caused a profuse sweat two other bold springs adjacent to this\r\nare much warmer, their heat being so great as to make the hand of a\r\nperson smart extreemly when immerced. I think the temperature of these\r\nsprings about the same as the hotest of the hot springs in Virginia.\r\nboth the men and indians amused themselves with the use of a bath this\r\nevening. I observed that the indians after remaining in the hot bath as\r\nlong as they could bear it ran and plunged themselves into the creek\r\nthe water of which is now as cold as ice can make it; after remaining\r\nhere a few minutes they returned again to the warm bath, repeating this\r\ntransision several times but always ending with the warm bath. I killed\r\na small black pheasant near the quamash grounds this evening which is\r\nthe first I have seen below the snowy region. I also saw some young\r\npheasants which were about the size of Chickens of 3 days old. saw the\r\ntrack of two bearfoot indians who were supposed to be distressed\r\nrufugees who had fled from the Minnetares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 29, 1806]\r\nSunday June 29th 1806\r\nWe colected our horses and Set out haveing previously dispatched\r\nDrewyer & R. Field to the Warm Springs to hunt. we prosued the hights\r\nof the ridge on which we have been passing for several days; it\r\ntermonated at the distance of 5 M. from our encampment, and we decended\r\nto & passed the main branch of Kooskooke 11/2 Ms. above the enterance\r\nof Glade Creek which falls in on the N. E. Side. we bid adew to the\r\nSnow. near the River we found a Deer which the hunters had killed and\r\nleft us. this was a fortunate Supply as all our bears oil was now\r\nexhosted, and we were reduced to our roots alone without Salt. the\r\nriver is 30 yds wide and runs with great velossity. the bead as all the\r\nMountain streams is composed of Smooth Stone. beyond this river we\r\nassended a Steep Mountain about 2 Miles to it's Sumit where we found\r\nthe old road which we had passed on as we went out. comeing in on our\r\nright, the road was now much plainer and much beaten. at noon we arived\r\nat the quawmash flatts on Vally Creek and halted to graize our horses\r\nand dined haveing traveled 12 Miles here is a pretty little plain of\r\nabout 50 acres plentifully Stocked with quawmash and from appearance\r\nthis forms one of the principal Stages of the indians who pass the\r\nmountains on this road. we found that one of our pack horss with his\r\nload and one of Capt. L.s. horses were missing we dispatched Jo. Field\r\n& Colter in serch of the lost horse's. after dinner we continued our\r\nmarch 7 ms further to the worm Springs where we arrived early in the\r\nevening, and Sent out Several hunters, who as well as R. Field &\r\nDrewyer returned unsuksessfull; late in the evening Jo. Field & Colter\r\njoined us with the lost horses and brought with them a Deer which J. F.\r\nhad killed, this furnished us with a Supper.\r\n\r\nThose Worm or Hot Springs are Situated at the base of a a hill of no\r\nconsiderable hight, on the N. Side and near the bank of travellers rest\r\nCreek which is at that place about 10 yds wide. these Springs issue\r\nfrom the bottom and through the interstices of a grey freestone rock,\r\nthe rock rises in irregular masy clifts in a circular range, arround\r\nthe Springs on their lower Side. imediately above the Springs on the\r\nCreek there is a handsom little quawmash plain of about 10 acres. the\r\nprincipal Spring is about the temperature of the Warmest baths used at\r\nthe Hot Springs in Virginia. in this bath which had been prepared by\r\nthe Indians by stopping the river with Stone and mud, I bathed and\r\nremained in 10 minits it was with dificuelty I could remain this long\r\nand it causd a profuse swet. two other bold Springs adjacent to this\r\nare much warmer, their heat being so great as to make the hand of a\r\nperson Smart extreemly when immerced. we think the temperature of those\r\nSprings about the Same as that of the hotest of the hot Springs of\r\nVirginia. both the Men and the indians amused themselves with the use\r\nof the bath this evening. I observe after the indians remaining in the\r\nhot bath as long as they could bear it run and plunge themselves into\r\nthe Creek the water of which is now as Cold as ice Can make it; after\r\nremaining here a fiew minits they return again to the worm bath\r\nrepeeting this transision Several times but always ending with the worm\r\nbath. Saw the tracks of 2 bearfooted indians-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, June 30, 1806]\r\nMonday June 30th 1806.\r\nWe dispatched Drewyer and J. Fields early this morning to hunt on the\r\nroad and indeavour to obtain some meat for us. just as we had prepared\r\nto set out at an early hour a deer came in to lick at these springs and\r\none of our hunters killed it; this secured us our dinners, and we\r\nproceeded down the creek sometimes in the bottoms and at other times on\r\nthe top or along the steep sides of the ridge to the N. of the Creek.\r\nat one mile from the springs we passed a stout branch of the creek on\r\nthe north side and at noon having travelled 13 ms. we arrived at the\r\nentrance of a second Northen branch of the creek where we had nooned it\r\non the 12 th of Septr. last. here we halted, dined and graized our\r\nhorses. while here Sheilds took a small tern and killed a deer. at this\r\nplace a road turns off to the wright which the indians informed us\r\nleads to Clarks river some distance below where there is a fine\r\nextensive vally in which the Shalees or Ootslashshoots sometimes\r\nreside. in descending the creek this morning on the steep side of a\r\nhigh hill my horse sliped with both his hinder feet out of the road and\r\nfell, I also fell off backwards and slid near 40 feet down the hill\r\nbefore I could stop myself such was the steepness of the declivity; the\r\nhorse was near falling on me in the first instance but fortunately\r\nrecovers and we both escaped unhirt. I saw a small grey squirrel today\r\nmuch like those of the Pacific coast only that the belly of this was\r\nwhite. I also met with the plant in blume which is sometimes called the\r\nlady's slipper or mockerson flower. it is in shape and appearance like\r\nours only that the corolla is white, marked with small veigns of pale\r\nred longitudinally on the inner side. after dinner we resumed our\r\nmarch. soon after seting out Sheilds killed another deer and in the\r\ncourse of the evening we picked up three others which Drewyer had\r\nkilled along the road making a total of 6 today. Deer are very abundant\r\nin the neighbourhood of travellers rest of both speceis, also some\r\nbighorns and Elk. a little before sunset we arrived at our old\r\nencampment on the south side of the creek a little above it's entrance\r\ninto Clark's river. here we encamped with a view to remain two days in\r\norder to rest ourselves and horses & make our final arrangements for\r\nseperation. we came 19 ms. after dinner the road being much better than\r\nit has been since we entered the mountains we found no appearance of\r\nthe Ootslashshoots having been here lately. the indians express much\r\nconcern for them and apprehend that the Minnetares of fort de Prarie\r\nhave distroyed them in the course of the last winter and spring, and\r\nmention the tracks of the bearfoot Indians which we saw yesterday as an\r\nevidence of their being much distressed.--our horses have stood the\r\njourney supprisingly well, most of them are yet in fine order, and only\r\nwant a few days rest to restore them perfectly.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 30, 1806]\r\nMonday June 30th 1806\r\nWe dispatched Drewyer & Jo. Field early this morning ahead to hunt.\r\njust as we had prepard. to set out at an early hour, a deer Came in to\r\nlick at the Springs and one of our hunters killed it; this Secired to\r\nus our dinner. and we proceeded down the Creek, Sometimes in the\r\nbottoms and at other times on the tops or along the Steep Sides of the\r\nridge to the N of the Creek. at 11/2 m. we passd our encampment of the\r\n12th of Septr. last. we noon'd it at the place we had on the 12 of\r\nSeptr. last whiles here Shields killed a deer on the N. fork near the\r\nroad. here a rode leads up the N. fork and passed over to an extensive\r\nvally on Clarks river at Some distance down that river as our guids\r\ninform us. after dinner we resumed our march. Soon after Setting out\r\nShields killed another deer, and we picked up 3 others which G Drewyer\r\nhad killed along the road. Deer are very abundant in the neighbourhood\r\nof travellers rest of boath Specis, also Some big horn and Elk. a\r\nlittle before Sunset we arrived at our old encampment on the S. Side of\r\nthe Creek a little above its enterance into Clarks river. here we\r\nEncamped with a view to remain 2 days in order to rest ourselves and\r\nhorses and make our final arrangements for Seperation. we found no\r\nsigns of the Oatlashshots haveing been here lately. the Indians express\r\nmuch Concern for them and apprehend that the Menetarries of Fort d Prar\r\nhave destroyed them in the course of the last Winter and Spring, and\r\nmention the tracts of the bearfooted indians which we Saw yesterday as\r\nan evidence of their being much distressed-. our horses have stood the\r\njourney Supirisinly well and only want a fiew days rest to restore them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, June 30, 1806]\r\nDescended the mountain to Travellers rest leaveing those tremendious\r\nmountanes behind us-in passing of which we have experiensed Cold and\r\nhunger of which I shall ever remember. in passing over this part of the\r\nRocky mountains from Clarks river, to the quawmash flats from the 14th\r\nto the 19th of Septr. 1805 we marched through Snow, which fell on us on\r\nthe night of the 14th and nearly all the day of the 15 in addition to\r\nthe cold rendered the air cool and the way difficuelt. our food was\r\nhorses of which we eate three.--On our return we Set out from the\r\nquawmash flats on the 15th of June and commenes the assent of the rocky\r\nmountains; the air became cool and vigitation backward--on the 16th we\r\nmet with banks of Snow and in the hollars and maney of the hill Sides\r\nthe Snow was from 3 to 4 feet deep and Scercely any grass vegitation\r\njust commencing where the Snow had melted--on the 17th at meridian, the\r\nSnow became So deep in every derection from 6 to 8 feet deep we could\r\nnot prosue the road there being no grass for our horses we were obliged\r\nto return to the quawmash flatts to precure meat to live on as well as\r\ngrass for our horses--leaveing our baggage on the mountains We precured\r\n5 Indians as pilots and on the 24th of June 1806 we again under took\r\nthose Snowey regn. on the 26th we with our baggage arived at an open\r\nplain serounded with Snow where there was grass for horses on the 27th\r\n& 28th also passing over Snow 6 or 8 feet deep all the way on 29th\r\npassed over but little Snow--but saw great masses of it lying in\r\ndifferent directions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 1, 1806]\r\nTuesday July 1st 1806.\r\nThis morning early we sent out all our hunters. set Sheilds at work to\r\nrepair some of our guns which were out of order Capt. Clark & my self\r\nconsurted the following plan viz. from this place I determined to go\r\nwith a small party by the most direct rout to the falls of the\r\nMissouri, there to leave Thompson McNeal and goodrich to prepare\r\ncarriages and geer for the purpose of transporting the canoes and\r\nbaggage over the portage, and myself and six volunteers to ascend\r\nMaria's river with a view to explore the country and ascertain whether\r\nany branch of that river lies as far north as Latd. 50 and again return\r\nand join the party who are to decend the Missouri, at the entrance of\r\nMaria's river. I now called for the volunteers to accompany me on this\r\nrout, many turned out, from whom I scelected Drewyer the two Feildses,\r\nWerner, Frazier and Sergt Gass accompanied me the other part of the men\r\nare to proceed with Capt Clark to the head of Jefferson's river where\r\nwe deposited sundry articles and left our canoes. from hence Sergt\r\nOrdway with a party of 9 men are to decend the river with the canoes;\r\nCapt C. with the remaining ten including Charbono and York will proceed\r\nto the Yellowstone river at it's nearest approach to the three forks of\r\nthe missouri, here he will build a canoe and decend the Yellowstone\r\nriver with Charbono the indian woman, his servant York and five others\r\nto the missouri where should he arrive first he will wait my arrival.\r\nSergt Pryor with two other men are to proceed with the horses by land\r\nto the Mandans and thence to the British posts on the Assinniboin with\r\na letter to Mr. Heney whom we wish to engage to prevail on the Sioux\r\nChefs to join us on the Missouri, and accompany them with us to the\r\nseat of the general government. these arrangements being made the party\r\nwere informed of our design and prepared themselves accordingly. our\r\nhunters killed 13 deer in the course of this day of which 7 were fine\r\nbucks, deer are large and in fine order. the indians inform us that\r\nthere are a great number of white buffaloe or mountain sheep of the\r\nsnowey hights of the mountains West of this river; they state that they\r\ninhabit the most rocky and inaccessible parts, and run but badly, that\r\nthey kill them with great ease with their arrows when they can find\r\nthem. the indian warrior who overtook us on the 26th Ult. made me a\r\npresent of an excellent horse which he said he gave for the good\r\ncouncil we had given himself and nation and also to assure us of his\r\nattatchment to the white men and his desire to be at peace with the\r\nMinnetares of Fort de Prarie. we had our venison fleeced and exposed in\r\nthe sun on pole to dry. the dove the black woodpecker, the lark\r\nwoodpecker, the logcock, the prarie lark, sandhill crain, prarie hen\r\nwith the short and pointed tail, the robin, a speceis of brown plover,\r\na few curloos, small black birds, ravens hawks and a variety of\r\nsparrows as well as the bee martin and the several speceis of Corvus\r\ngenus are found in this vally.\r\n\r\nWindsor birst his gun near the muzzle a few days since; this Sheilds\r\ncut off and I then exchanged it with the Cheif for the one we had given\r\nhim for conducting us over the mountains. he was much pleased with the\r\nexchange and shot his gun several times; he shoots very well for an\r\ninexperienced person.\r\n\r\nThe little animal found in the plains of the Missouri which I have\r\ncalled the barking squirrel weighs from 3 to 31/2 pounds. it's form is\r\nthat of the squirrel. it's colour is an uniform light brick red grey,\r\nthe red reather predominating. the under side of the neck and bely are\r\nlighter coloured than the other parts of the body. the legs are short,\r\nand it is wide across the breast and sholders in propotion to it's\r\nsize, appears strongly formed in that part; the head is also bony\r\nmuscular and stout, reather more blontly terminated wider and flatter\r\nthan the common squirrel. the upper lip is split or divided to the\r\nnose. the ears are short and lie close to the head, having the\r\nappearance of being cut off, in this particular they resemble the\r\nguinea pig. the teeth are like those of the squrrel rat &c. they have a\r\nfalse jaw or pocket between the skin and the mustle of the jaw like\r\nthat of the common ground squrrel but not so large in proportion to\r\ntheir size. they have large and full whiskers on each side of the nose,\r\na few long hairs of the same kind on each jaw and over the eyes. the\r\neye is small and black. they have five toes on each foot of which the\r\ntwo outer toes on each foot are much shoter than those in the center\r\nparticularly the two inner toes of the fore feet, the toes of the fore\r\nfeet are remarkably long and sharp and seem well adapted to cratching\r\nor burrowing those of the hind feet are neither as long or sharp as the\r\nformer; the nails are black. the hair of this animal is about as long\r\nand equally as course as that of the common grey squrrel of our\r\ncountry, and the hair of the tail is not longer than that of the body\r\nexcept immediately at the extremity where it is somewhat longer and\r\nfrequently of a dark brown colour. the part of generation in the female\r\nis placed on the lower region of the belly between the hinder legs so\r\nfar forward that she must lie on her back to copolate. the whole length\r\nof this animal is one foot five inches from the extremity of the nose\r\nto that of the tail of which the tail occupyes 4 inches. it is nearly\r\ndouble the size of the whistleing squirrel of the Columbia. it is much\r\nmore quick active and fleet than it's form would indicate. these\r\nsquirrels burrow in the ground in the open plains usually at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the water yet are never seen at any distance\r\nfrom their burrows. six or eight usually reside in one burrow to which\r\nthere is never more than one entrance. these burrows are of great\r\ndebth. I once dug and pursued a burrow to the debth of ten feet and did\r\nnot reach it's greatest debth. they generally associate in large\r\nsocieties placing their burrows near each other and frequently occupy\r\nin this manner several hundred acres of land. when at rest above ground\r\ntheir position is generally erect on their hinder feet and rump; thus\r\nthey will generally set and bark at you as you approach them, their\r\nnote being much that of the little toy dogs, their yelps are in quick\r\nsuccession and at each they a motion to their tails upwards. they feed\r\non the grass and weeds within the limits of their village which they\r\nnever appear to exceed on any occasion. as they are usually numerous\r\nthey keep the grass and weeds within their district very closely\r\ngraized and as clean as if it had been swept. the earth which they\r\nthrow out of their burrows is usually formed into a conic mound around\r\nthe entrance. this little animal is frequently very fat and it's flesh\r\nis not unpleasant. as soon as the hard frosts commence it shuts up it's\r\nburrow and continues within untill spring. it will eat grain or meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 1, 1806]\r\nTuesday July 1st 1806 on Clark's river\r\nWe Sent out all the hunters very early this morning by 12 OClock they\r\nall returned haveing killd. 12 Deer Six of them large fat Bucks, this\r\nis like once more returning to the land of liveing a plenty of meat and\r\nthat very good. as Capt. Lewis and Myself part at this place we make a\r\ndivision of our party and such baggage and provisions as is Souteable.\r\nthe party who will accompany Capt L. is G. Drewyer, Sergt. Gass, Jo. &\r\nR. Fields, Frazier & Werner, and Thompson Goodrich & McNear as far as\r\nthe Falls of Missouri at which place the 3 latter will remain untill I\r\nSend down the Canoes from the head of Jeffersons river. they will then\r\njoin that party and after passing the portage around the falls, proceed\r\non down to the enterance of Maria where Capt. Lewis will join them\r\nafter haveing assended that river as high up as Laid. 50° North. from the\r\nhead of Jeffersons river I shall proceed on to the head of the\r\nRockejhone with a party of 9 or 10 men and desend that river. from the\r\nR Rockejhone I Shall dispatch Sergt. Pryor with the horses to the\r\nMandans and from thence to the Tradeing Establishments of the N. W. Co\r\non the Assinniboin River with a letter which we have written for the\r\npurpose to engage Mr. H. Haney to endeaver to get Some of the principal\r\nChiefs of the Scioux to accompany us to the Seat of our government &.\r\nwe divide the Loading and apportion the horses. Capt L. only takes 17\r\nhorses with him, 8 only of which he intends to take up the Maria &c.\r\nOne of the Indians who accompaned us Swam Clarks river and examined the\r\nCountry around, on his return he informed us that he had discovered\r\nwhere a Band of the Tushepaws had encamped this Spring passed of 64\r\nLodges, & that they had passed Down Clarks river and that it was\r\nprobable that they were near the quawmash flatts on a Easterly branch\r\nof that river. those guides expressed a desire to return to their\r\nnation and not accompany us further, we informed them that if they was\r\ndeturmined to return we would kill some meat for them, but wished that\r\nthey would accompy Capt. Lewis on the rout to the falls of Missouri\r\nonly 2 nights and show him the right road to cross the Mountains. this\r\nthey agreed to do. we gave a medal of the Small Size to the young man\r\nSon to the late Great Chief of the Chopunnish Nation who had been\r\nremarkably kind to us in every instance, to all the others we tied a\r\nbunch of blue ribon about the hair, which pleased them very much. the\r\nIndian man who overtook us in the Mountain, presented Capt. Lewis with\r\na horse and said that he opened his ears to what we had said, and hoped\r\nthat Cap Lewis would see the Crovanters of Fort De Prarie and make a\r\ngood peace that it was their desire to be at peace. Shew them the horse\r\nas a token of their wishes &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 2, 1806]\r\nWednesday July 2ed 1806.\r\nWe sent out the hunters early this morning, they returned not so\r\nsuccesfull as yesterday having killed 2 deer only. Sheilds continued\r\nrepairing the gunns which he compleated by evening. all arrangements\r\nbeing now compleat we determined to set out in the morning. in the\r\ncourse of the day we had much conversation with the indians by signs,\r\nour only mode of communicating our ideas. they informed us that they\r\nwished to go in surch of the Ootslashshoots their friends and intended\r\nleaving us tomorrow morning, I prevailed on them to go with me as far\r\nas the East branch of Clark's River and put me on the road to the\r\nMissouri. I gave the Cheif a medal of the small size; he insisted on\r\nexchanging names with me according to their custom which was\r\naccordingly done and I was called Yo-me-kol-lick which interpreted is\r\nthe white bearskin foalded. in the evening the indians run their\r\nhorses, and we had several foot races betwen the natives and our party\r\nwith various success. these are a race of hardy strong athletic active\r\nmen. nothin worthy of notice transpired in the course of the day.\r\nGoodrich and McNeal are both very unwell with the pox which they\r\ncontracted last winter with the Chinnook women this forms my inducement\r\nprincipally for taking them to the falls of the Missouri where during\r\nan intervail of rest they can use the murcury freely. I found two\r\nspeceis of native clover here, the one with a very narrow small leaf\r\nand a pale red flower, the other nearly as luxouriant as our red clover\r\nwith a white flower the leaf and blume of the latter are proportionably\r\nlarge. I found several other uncommon plants specemines of which I\r\npreserved. The leaf of the cottonwood on this river is like that common\r\nto the Columbia narrower than that common to the lower part of the\r\nMissouri and Mississippi and wider than that on the upper part of the\r\nMissouri. the wild rose, servise berry, white berryed honeysuckle,\r\nseven bark, elder, alder aspin, choke cherry and the broad and narrow\r\nleafed willow are natives of this valley. the long leafed pine forms\r\nthe principal timber of the neighbourhood, and grows as well in the\r\nriver bottoms as on the hills. the firs and larch are confined to the\r\nhigher parts of the hills and mountains. the tops of the high mountains\r\non either side of this river are covered with snow. the musquetoes have\r\nbeen excessively troublesome to us since our arrival at this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 2, 1806]\r\nWednesday July 2nd 1806\r\nSent out 2 hunters this morning and they killed 2 Deer. the Musquetors\r\nhas been So troublesom day and night Since our arrival in this Vally\r\nthat we are tormented very much by them and Cant write except under our\r\nBears. We gave the Second gun to our guides agreeable to our promis,\r\nand to each we gave Powder & ball I had the greater part of the meat\r\ndried for to Subsist my party in the Mountains between the head of\r\nJeffersons & Clarks rivers where I do not expect to find any game to\r\nkill. had all of our arms put in the most prime order two of the rifles\r\nhave unfortunately bursted near the muscle, Shields Cut them off and\r\nthey Shute tolerable well one which is very Short we exchanged with the\r\nIndian whoe we had given a longer gun to induc them to pilot us across\r\nthe Mountains. we caused every man to fill his horn with powder & have\r\na sufficincy of Balls &c. the last day in passing down Travellers rest\r\nCreek Capt Lewis fell down the Side of a Steep Mountain near 40 feet\r\nbut fortunately receved no dammage. his hors was near falling on him\r\nbut fortunately recovered and they both escaped unhurt. I killed a\r\nSmall grey squurel and a Common pheasant. Capt L. Showed me a plant in\r\nblume which is Sometimes called the ladies Slipper or Mockerson flower.\r\nit is in shape and appearance like ours only that the corolla is white\r\nmarked with Small veigns of pale red longitudinally on the inner Side,\r\nand much Smaller. The Indians and Some of our men amused themselves in\r\nrunning races on foot as well as with their horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 3, 1806]\r\nThursday July 3rd 1806.\r\nAll arrangements being now compleated for carrying into effect the\r\nseveral scheemes we had planed for execution on our return, we saddled\r\nour horses and set out I took leave of my worthy friend and companion\r\nCapt. Clark and the party that accompanyed him. I could not avoid\r\nfeeling much concern on this occasion although I hoped this seperation\r\nwas only momentary. I proceeded down Clark's river seven miles with my\r\nparty of nine men and five indians. here the Indians recommended our\r\npassing the river which was rapid and 150 yds. wide. 2 miles above this\r\nplace I passed the entrance of the East branch of Clark's River which\r\ndischarges itself by two channels; the water of this river is more\r\nterbid than the main stream and is from 90 to 120 yds. wide. as we had\r\nno other means of passing the river we busied ourselves collecting dry\r\ntimber for the purpose of constructing rafts; timber being scarce we\r\nfound considerable difficulty in procuring as much as made three small\r\nrafts. we arrived at 11 A.M. and had our rafts completed by 3 P.M. when\r\nwe dined and began to take over our baggage which we effected in the\r\ncourse of 3 hours the rafts being obliged to return several times. the\r\nIndians swam over their horses and drew over their baggage in little\r\nbasons of deer skins which they constructed in a very few minutes for\r\nthat purpose. we drove our horses in after them and they followed to\r\nthe opposite shore. I remained myself with two men who could scarcely\r\nswim untill the last; by this time the raft by passing so frequently\r\nhad fallen a considerable distance down the river to a rapid and\r\ndifficult part of it crouded with several small Islands and willow bars\r\nwhich were now overflown; with these men I set out on the raft and was\r\nsoon hurried down with the current a mile and a half before we made\r\nshore, on our approach to the shore the raft sunk and I was drawn off\r\nthe raft by a bush and swam on shore the two men remained on the raft\r\nand fortunately effected a landing at some little distance below. I wet\r\nthe chronometer by this accedent which I had placed in my fob as I\r\nconceived for greater security. I now joined the party and we proceeded\r\nwith the indians about 3 Ms. to a small Creek and encamped at sunset. I\r\nsent out the hunters who soon returned with three very fine deer of\r\nwhich I gave the indians half These people now informed me that the\r\nroad which they shewed me at no great distance from our Camp would lead\r\nus up the East branch of Clark's river and a river they called\r\nCokahlarishkit or the river of the road to buffaloe and thence to\r\nmedicine river and the falls of the Missouri where we wished to go.\r\nthey alledged that as the road was a well beaten track we could not now\r\nmiss our way and as they were affraid of meeting with their enimies the\r\nMinnetares they could not think of continuing with us any longer, that\r\nthey wished now to proceed down Clark's river in surch of their friends\r\nthe Shalees. they informed us that not far from the dividing ridge\r\nbetween the waters of this and the Missouri rivers the roads forked\r\nthey recommended the left hand as the best rout but said they would\r\nboth lead us to the falls of the Missouri. I directed the hunters to\r\nturn out early in the morning and indeavour to kill some more meat for\r\nthese people whom I was unwilling to leave without giving them a good\r\nsupply of provision after their having been so obliging as to conduct\r\nus through those tremendious mountains. the musquetoes were so\r\nexcessively troublesome this evening that we were obliged to kindle\r\nlarge fires for our horses these insects tortured them in such manner\r\nuntill they placed themselves in the smoke of the fires that I realy\r\nthought they would become frantic. about an hour after dark the air\r\nbecome so coald that the musquetoes disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe saw the fresh track of a horse this evening in the road near our\r\ncamp which the indians supposed to be a Shale spye. we killed a prarie\r\nhen with the short and pointed tail she had a number of young which\r\ncould just fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 4, 1806]\r\nJuly 4th 1806.\r\nAn Indian arrived alone from the West side of the mountains. he had\r\npursued and overtook us here. sent out the hunters early to kill some\r\nmeat to give the indians as they would not go with us further and I was\r\nunwilling after they service they had rendered to send them away\r\nwithout a good store of provision. they are going down Clark's River in\r\nsurch of the Shalees their friends, and from thence intend returning by\r\nthis rout home again, they fleesed their meat informed us that they\r\nshould dry it and leave it for their homeward journey.--Set out at 12.\r\nhad killed no deer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 4, 1806]\r\nFriday July 4th 1806.\r\nI arrose early this morning and sent out Drewyer and the Fieldses to\r\nhunt. at 6. A.M. a man of the Pallote pellows arrived from the West\r\nside of the Rocky mountains; he had pursued us a few days after our\r\ndeparture and overtook us at this place; he proved to be the same young\r\nman who had first attempted to pass the rocky mountains early in June\r\nlast when we lay on the Kooskooske and was obliged to relinquish the\r\nenterprize in consequence of the debth and softness of the snow. I gave\r\na shirt a handkercheif and a small quantity of ammunition to the\r\nindians. at half after eleven the hunters returned from the chase\r\nunsuccessfull. I now ordered the horses saddled smoked a pipe with\r\nthese friendly people and at noon bid them adieu. they had cut the meat\r\nwhich I gave them last evening thin and exposed it in the sun to dry\r\ninforming me that they should leave it in this neighbourhood untill\r\nthey returned as a store for their homeward journey. it is worthy of\r\nremark that these people were about to return by the same pass by which\r\nthey had conducted us through the difficult part of the Rocky\r\nMountains, altho they were about to decend Clark's river several days\r\njourney in surch of the Shale's their relations, a circumstance which\r\nto my mind furnishes sufficient evidence that there is not so near or\r\nso good a rout to the plains of Columbia by land along that river as\r\nthat which we came. the several war routs of the Minetarees which fall\r\ninto this vally of Clark's river concenter at traveller's rest beyond\r\nwhich point they have never yet dared to venture in pursuit of the\r\nnations beyond the mountains. all the nations also on the west side of\r\nthe mountain with whom we are acquainted inhabiting the waters of\r\nLewis's river & who visit the plains of the Missouri pass by this rout.\r\nthese affectionate people our guides betrayed every emmotion of\r\nunfeigned regret at seperating from us; they said that they were\r\nconfidint that the Pahkees, (the appellation they give the Minnetares)\r\nwould cut us off. the first 5 miles of our rout was through a part of\r\nthe extensive plain in which we were encamped, we then entered the\r\nmountains with the East fork of Clark's river through a narrow confined\r\npass on it's N. side continuing up that river five ms. further to the\r\nentrance of the Cokahlahishkit R which falls in on the N. E. side, is\r\n60 yds. wide deep and rapid. the banks bold not very high but never\r\noverflow. the East fork below its junction with this stream is 100 yds.\r\nwide and above it about 90. the water of boath are terbid but the East\r\nbranch much the most so; their beds are composed of sand and gravel;\r\nthe East fork possesses a large portion of the former. neither of those\r\nstreams are navigable in consequence of the rapids and shoals which\r\nobstruct their currents. thus far a plain or untimbered country\r\nbordered the river which near the junction of these streams spread into\r\na handsome level plain of no great extent; the hills were covered with\r\nlong leafed pine and fir.

I met with the hunters at a\r\nlittle grove of timber opposite to the island where they had killed a\r\ncowl and were waiting our arrival. they had met with no elk. I directed\r\nthe hunters to kill some buffaloe as well for the benifit of their\r\nskins to enable us to pass the river as for their meat for the men I\r\nmeant to leave at this place. we unloaded our horses and encamped\r\nopposite to the Islands. had the cow skined and some willows sticks\r\ncollected to make canoes of the hides by 12 OCk. they killed eleven\r\nbuffaloe most of them in fine order. the bulls are now generally much\r\nfatter than the cows and are fine beef. I sent out all hands with the\r\nhorses to assist in buthering and bringing in the meat by 3 in the\r\nevening we had brought in a large quantity of fine beef and as many\r\nhides as we wanted for canoes shelters and geer. I then set all hands\r\nto prepare two canoes the one we made after the mandan fassion with a\r\nsingle skin in the form of a bason and the other we constructed of two\r\nskins on a plan of our own. we were unable to compleat our canoes this\r\nevening. the wind blew very hard. we continued our operations untill\r\ndark and then retired to rest.

I fear that they are stolen. I\r\ndispatch two men on horseback in surch of them. the wind blew so\r\nviolently that I did not think it prudent to attempt passing the\r\nriver.--at Noon Werner returned having found three others of the horses\r\nnear Fort Mountain. Sergt. Gass did not return untill 3 P.M. not having\r\nfound the horses. he had been about 8 ms. up medecine river. I now\r\ndispatched Joseph Fields and Drewyer in quest of them. the former\r\nreturned at dark unsuccessfull and the latter continued absent all\r\nnight. at 5 P.M. the wind abated and we transported our baggage and\r\nmeat to the opposite shore in our canoes which we found answered even\r\nbeyond our expectations. we swam our horses over also and encamped at\r\nsunset. quetoes extreemly troublesome. I think the river is somewhat\r\nhigher than when we were here last summer. the present season has been\r\nmuch more moist than the preceeding one. the grass and weeds are much\r\nmore luxouriant than they were when I left this place on the 13th of\r\nJuly 1805 saw the brown thrush, pigeons, doves &c.\r\n\r\nthe yellow Currants begining to ripen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 13, 1806]\r\n13th July.\r\nremoved above to my old station opposite the upper point of the white\r\nbear island. formed our camp and set Thompson &c at work to complete\r\nthe geer for the horses. had the cash opened found my bearskins entirly\r\ndestroyed by the water, the river having risen so high that the water\r\nhad penitrated. all my specimens of plants also lost. the Chart of the\r\nMissouri fortunately escaped. opened my trunks and boxes and exposed\r\nthe articles to dry. found my papers damp and several articles damp.\r\nthe stoper had come out of a phial of laudinum and the contents had run\r\ninto the drawer and distroyed a gret part of my medicine in such manner\r\nthat it was past recovery. waited very impatiently for the return of\r\nDrewyer he did not arrive.

I find the fat buffaloe\r\nmeat a great improvement to the mush of these roots. the old cash being\r\ntoo damp to venture to deposit my trunks &c in I sent them over to the\r\nLarge island and had them put on a high scaffold among some thick brush\r\nand covered with skins. I take this precaution lest some indians may\r\nvisit the men I leave here before the arrival of the main party and rob\r\nthem. the hunters killed a couple of wolves, the buffaloe have almost\r\nentirely disappeared. saw the bee martin. the wolves are in great\r\nnumbers howling arround us and loling about in the plains in view at\r\nthe distance of two or three hundred yards. I counted 27 about the\r\ncarcase of a buffaloe which lies in the water at the upper point of the\r\nlarge island. these are generally of the large kind.

South of our\r\nencampment of the 7th inst. and had pursued this road Westwardly; I\r\nhave no doubt but they are a party of the Tushapahs who have been on a\r\nbuffaloe hunt. Drewyer informed that there camp was in a small bottom\r\non the river of about 5 acres inclosed by the steep and rocky and lofty\r\nclifts of the river and that so closely had they kept themselves and\r\nhorses within this little spot that there was not a track to be seen of\r\nthem within a quarter of a mile of that place. every spire of grass was\r\neaten up by their horses near their camp which had the appearance of\r\ntheir having remained here some time. his horse being much fatiegued\r\nwith the ride he had given him and finding that the indians had at\r\nleast 2 days the start of him thought it best to return. his safe\r\nreturn has releived me from great anxiety. I had already settled it in\r\nmy mind that a whitebear had killed him and should have set out\r\ntomorrow in surch of him, and if I could not find him to continue my\r\nrout to Maria's river. I knew that if he met with a bear in the plains\r\neven he would attack him. and that if any accedent should happen to\r\nseperate him from his horse in that situation the chances in favour of\r\nhis being killed would be as 9 to 10. I felt so perfectly satisfyed\r\nthat he had returned in safety that I thought but little of the horses\r\nalthough they were seven of the best I had. this loss great as it is,\r\nis not intirely irreparable, or at least dose not defeat my design of\r\nexploring Maria's river. I have yet 10 horses remaining, two of the\r\nbest and two of the worst of which I leave to assist the party in\r\ntaking the canoes and baggage over the portage and take the remaining 6\r\nwith me; these are but indifferent horses most of them but I hope they\r\nmay answer our purposes. I shall leave three of my intended party, (viz\r\n) Gass, Frazier and Werner, and take the two Feildses and Drewyer. by\r\nhaving two spare horses we can releive those we ride. having made this\r\narrangement I gave orders for an early departure in the morning, indeed\r\nI should have set out instantly but McNeal road one of the horses which\r\nI intend to take and has not yet returned. a little before dark McNeal\r\nreturned with his musquet broken off at the breech, and informed me\r\nthat on his arrival at willow run he had approached a white bear within\r\nten feet without discover him the bear being in the thick brush, the\r\nhorse took the allarm and turning short threw him immediately under the\r\nbear; this animal raised himself on his hinder feet for battle, and\r\ngave him time to recover from his fall which he did in an instant and\r\nwith his clubbed musquet he struck the bear over the head and cut him\r\nwith the guard of the guns and broke off the breech, the bear stunned\r\nwith the stroke fell to the ground and began to scratch his head with\r\nhis feet; this gave McNeal time to climb a willow tree which was near\r\nat hand and thus fortunately made his escape. the bear waited at the\r\nfoot of the tree untill late in the evening before he left him, when\r\nMcNeal ventured down and caught his horse which had by this time\r\nstrayed off to the distance of 2 ms. and returned to camp. these bear\r\nare a most tremenduous animal; it seems that the hand of providence has\r\nbeen most wonderfully in our favor with rispect to them, or some of us\r\nwould long since have fallen a sacrifice to their farosity. there seems\r\nto be a sertain fatality attatched to the neighbourhood of these falls,\r\nfor there is always a chapter of accedents prepared for us during our\r\nresidence at them. the musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner\r\nthat we can scarcely exist; for my own part I am confined by them to my\r\nbier at least 3/4ths of my time. my dog even howls with the torture he\r\nexperiences from them, they are almost insupportable, they are so\r\nnumerous that we frequently get them in our thrats as we breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 16, 1806]\r\nWednesday July 16th 1806.\r\nI dispatched a man early this morning to drive up the horses as usual,\r\nhe returned at 8 A.M. with one of them only. allarmed at this\r\noccurrence I dispatched one of my best hands on horseback in surch of\r\nthem he returned at 10 A.M. with them and I immediately set out. sent\r\nDrewyer and R. Fields with the horses to the lower side of Medecine\r\nriver, and proceeded myself with all our baggage and J. Fields down the\r\nmissouri to the mouth of Medecine river in our canoe of buffaloe skins.\r\nwe were compelled to swim the horses above the whitebear island and\r\nagain across medicine river as the Missouri is of great width below the\r\nmouth of that river. having arrived safely below Medicine river we\r\nimmediatly sadled our horses and proceeded down the river to the\r\nhandsom fall of 47 feet where I halted about 2 hours and took a haisty\r\nsketch of these falls; in the mean time we had some meat cooked and\r\ntook dinner after which we proceeded to the grand falls where we\r\narrived at sunset. on our way we saw two very large bear on the\r\nopposite side of the river. as we arrived in sight of the little wood\r\nbelow the falls we saw two other bear enter it; this being the only\r\nwood in the neighbourhood we were compelled of course to contend with\r\nthe bear for possession, and therefore left our horses in a place of\r\nsecurity and entered the wood which we surched in vain for the bear,\r\nthey had fled. here we encamped and the evening having the appearance\r\nof rain made our beds and slept under a shelving rock. these falls have\r\nabated much of their grandure since I first arrived at them in June\r\n1805, the water being much lower at preset than it was at that moment,\r\nhowever they are still a sublimely grand object. I determined to take a\r\nsecond drawing of it in the morning. we saw a few buffaloe as we passed\r\ntoday, the immence hirds which were about this place on our arrival\r\nhave principally passed the river and directed their course downwards.\r\nwe see a number of goats or antilopes always in passing through the\r\nplains of the Missouri above the Mandans. at this season they are\r\nthinly scattered over the plains but seem universally distributed in\r\nevery part; they appear very inquisitive usually to learn what we are\r\nas we pass, and frequently accompany us at no great distance for miles,\r\nfrequently halting and giving a loud whistle through their nostrils,\r\nthey are a very pretty animal and astonishingly fleet and active. we\r\nspent this evening free from the torture of the Musquetoes. there are a\r\ngreat number of geese which usually raise their young above these falls\r\nabout the entrance of Medicine river we saw them in large flocks of\r\nseveral hundred as we passed today. I saw both yesterday and today the\r\nCookkoo or as it is sometimes called the rain craw. this bird is not\r\nmet with west of the Rocky Mountains nor within them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 17, 1806]\r\nThursday July 17th 1806.\r\nI arrose early this morning and made a drawing of the falls. after\r\nwhich we took breakfast and departed. it being my design to strike\r\nMaria's river about the place at which I left it on my return to it's\r\nmouth in the begining of June 1805. I steered my course through the\r\nwide and level plains which have somewhat the appearance of an ocean,\r\nnot a tree nor a shrub to be seen. the land is not fertile, at least\r\nfar less so, than the plains of the Columbia or those lower down this\r\nriver, it is a light coloured soil intermixed with a considerable\r\nproportion of coarse gravel without sand, when dry it cracks and\r\nappears thursty and is very hard, in it's wet state, it is as soft and\r\nslipry as so much soft soap the grass is naturally but short and at\r\npresent has been rendered much more so by the graizing of the buffaloe,\r\nthe whole face of the country as far as the eye can reach looks like a\r\nwell shaved bowlinggreen, in which immence and numerous herds of\r\nbuffaloe were seen feeding attended by their scarcely less numerous\r\nsheepherds the wolves. we saw a number of goats as usual today, also\r\nthe party coloured plover with the brick red head and neck; this bird\r\nremains about the little ponds which are distributed over the face of\r\nthese plains and here raise their young. we killed a buffaloe cow as we\r\npassed throug the plains and took the hump and tonge which furnish\r\nample rations for four men one day. at 5 P.M. we arrived at rose rivers\r\nwhere I purposed remaining all night as I could not reach maria's river\r\nthis evening and unless I did there would be but little probability of\r\nour finding any wood and very probably no water either. on our arrival\r\nat the river we saw where a wounded and bleading buffaloe had just\r\npassed and concluded it was probable that the indians had been runing\r\nthem and were near at hand. the Minnetares of Fort de prarie and the\r\nblackfoot indians rove through this quarter of the country and as they\r\nare a vicious lawless and reather an abandoned set of wretches I wish\r\nto avoid an interview with them if possible. I have no doubt but they\r\nwould steel our horses if they have it in their power and finding us\r\nweak should they happen to be numerous wil most probably attempt to rob\r\nus of our arms and baggage; at all events I am determined to take every\r\npossible precaution to avoid them if possible. I hurried over the river\r\nto a thick wood and turned out the horses to graize; sent Drewyer to\r\npursue and kill the wounded buffaloe in order to determine whether it\r\nhad been wounded by the indians or not, and proceeded myself to\r\nreconnoitre the adjacent country having sent R. Fields for the same\r\npurpose a different rout. I ascended the river hills and by the help of\r\nmy glass examined the plains but could make no discovery, in about an\r\nhour I returned to camp, where I met with the others who had been as\r\nunsuccessfull as myself. Drewyer could not find the wounded buffaloe.\r\nJ. Fields whom I had left at camp had already roasted some of the\r\nbuffaloe meat and we took dinner after which I sent Drewyer and R.\r\nFields to resume their resurches for the indians; and set myself down\r\nto record the transactions of the day. rose river is at this place\r\nfifty yards wide, the water which is only about 3 feet deep occupys\r\nabout 35 yds. and is very terbid of a white colour. the general course\r\nof this river is from East to west so far as I can discover it's track\r\nthrough the plains, it's bottoms are wide and well timbered with\r\ncottonwood both the broad and narrow leafed speceis. the bed of this\r\nstream is small gravel and mud; it's banks are low but never overflow,\r\nthe hills are about 100 or 150 feet high; it possesses bluffs of earth\r\nlike the lower part of the Missouri; except the debth and valocity of\r\nit's stream and it is the Missouri in miniture. from the size of rose\r\nriver at this place and it's direction I have no doubt but it takes\r\nit's source within the first range of the Rocky mountains. the bush\r\nwhich bears the red berry is here in great plenty in the river bottoms\r\nThe spies returned having killed 2 beaver and a deer. they reported\r\nthat they saw no appearance of Indians.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 18, 1806]\r\nFriday July 18th 1806.\r\nWe set out this morning a little before sunrise ascended the river\r\nhills and continued our rout as yesterday through the open plains at\r\nabout 6 miles we reached the top of an elivated plain which divides the\r\nwaters of the rose river from those of Maria's river. from hence the\r\nNorth mountains, the South mountains, the falls mountains and the Tower\r\nMountain and those arround and to the East of the latter were visible.\r\nour course led us nearly parrallel with a creek of Maria's river which\r\ntakes it's rise in these high plains at the place we passed them; at\r\nnoon we struck this creek about 6 ms. from its junction with Maria's\r\nriver where we found some cottonwood timber; here we halted to dine and\r\ngraize our horses. the bed of this creek is about 25 yds. wide at this\r\nplace but is nearly dry at present, the water being confined to little\r\npools in the deeper parts of it's bed. from hence downwards there is a\r\nconsiderable quantity of timber in it's bottom. we passed immence herds\r\nof buffaloe on our way in short for about 12 miles it appeared as one\r\nherd only the whole plains and vally of this creek being covered with\r\nthem; saw a number of wolves of both speceis, also Antelopes and some\r\nhorses. after dinner we proceeded about 5 miles across the plain to\r\nMaria's river where we arrived at 6 P.M. we killed a couple of buffaloe\r\nin the bottom of this river and encamped on it's west side in a grove\r\nof cottonwood some miles above the entrance of the creek. being now\r\nconvinced that we were above the point to which I had formerly ascended\r\nthis river and faring that a fork of this stream might fall in on the\r\nNorthside between this place and the point to which I had ascended it,\r\nI directed Drewyer who was with me on my former excurtion, and Joseph\r\nFields to decend the river early in the morning to the place from\r\nwhence I had returned, and examine whether any stream fell inn or not.\r\nI keep a strict lookout every night, I take my tour of watch with the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 19, 1806]\r\nSaturday July 19th 1806.\r\nDrewyer and J. Fields set out early this morning in conformity to my\r\ninstructions last evening. they returned at 1/2 after 12 OCk. and\r\ninformed me that they had proceeded down the river to the place from\r\nwhich I had returned on the ____ of June last and that it was 6 miles\r\ndistant. they passed the entrance of buffaloe Creek at 2 ms. the course\r\nof the river from hence downwards as far as they were is N. 80 E. they\r\nkilled 8 deer and two Antelopes on their way; most of the deer were\r\nlarge fat mule bucks. having completed my observation of the sun's\r\nmeridian Altitude we set out, ascended the river hills having passed\r\nthe river and proceeded through the open plains up the N. side of the\r\nriver 20 miles and encamped. at 15 miles we passed a large creek on N.\r\nside a little above it's entrance; there is but little running water in\r\nthis creek at present, it's bed is about 30 yds. wide and appears to\r\ncome from the broken Mountains so called from their raggid and\r\nirregular shape there are three of them extending from east to West\r\nalmost unconnected, the center mountain terminates in a conic spire and\r\nis that which I have called the tower mountain they are destitute of\r\ntimber. from the entrance of this creek they bore N. 10° W. the river\r\nbottoms are usually about 1/2 a mile wide and possess a considerable\r\nquantity of timber entirely cottonwood; the underbrush is honeysuckle\r\nrose bushes the narrow leafed willow and the bush which bears the acid\r\nred berry called by the french engages grease de buff. just as we\r\nhalted to encamp R. Fields killed a mule doe. the plains are beautifull\r\nand level but the soil is but thin. in many parts of the plains there\r\nare great quantities of prickly pears. saw some herds of buffaloe today\r\nbut not in such quantities as yesterday, also antelopes, wolves, gees,\r\npigeons, doves, hawks, ravens crows larks sparrows &c. the Curlooe has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 20, 1806]\r\nSunday July 20th 1806\r\nWe set at sunrise and proceed through the open plain as yesterday up\r\nthe North side of the river. the plains are more broken than they were\r\nyesterday and have become more inferior in point of soil; a great\r\nquanty of small gravel is every where distributed over the surface of\r\nthe earth which renders travling extreemly painfull to our bearfoot\r\nhorses. the soil is generally a white or whiteish blue clay, this where\r\nit has been trodden by the buffaloe when wet has now become as firm as\r\na brickbat and stands in an inumerable little points quite as\r\nformidable to our horses feet as the gravel. the mineral salts common\r\nto the plains of the missouri has been more abundant today than usual.\r\nthe bluffs of the river are about 200 feet high, steep irregular and\r\nformed of earth which readily desolves with water, slips and\r\nprecipitates itself into the river as before mentioned frequentlly of\r\nthe bluffs of the Missouri below which they resemble in every\r\nparticular, differing essencially from those of the Missouri above the\r\nentrance of this river, they being composed of firm red or yellow clay\r\nwhich dose not yeald readily to the rains and a large quantity of rock.\r\nthe soil of the river bottom is fertile and well timbered, I saw some\r\ntrees today which would make small canoes. the timber is generally low.\r\nthe underbrush the same as before mentioned. we have seen fewer\r\nbuffaloe today than usual, though more Elk and not less wolves and\r\nAntelopes also some mule deer; this speceis of deer seems most\r\nprevalent in this quarter. saw some gees ducks and other birds common\r\nto the country. there is much appearance of beaver on this river, but\r\nnot any of otter. from the apparent decent of the country to the North\r\nand above the broken mountains I am induced to beleive that the South\r\nbranch of the Suskashawan receives a part of it's waters from the plain\r\neven to the borders of this river and from the brakes visible in the\r\nplains in a nothern direction think that a branch of that river\r\ndecending from the rocky mountains passes at no great distance from\r\nMaria's river and to the N. E. of the broken mountains. the day has\r\nproved excessively warm and we lay by four hours during the heat of it;\r\nwe traveled 28 miles and encamped as usual in the river bottom on it's\r\nN. side. there is scarcely any water at present in the plains and what\r\nthere is, lies in small pools and is so strongly impregnated with the\r\nmineral salts that it is unfit for any purpose except the uce of the\r\nbuffaloe. these animals appear to prefer this water to that of the\r\nriver. the wild liquorice and sunflower are very abundant in the plains\r\nand river bottoms, the latter is now in full blume; the silkgrass and\r\nsand rush are also common to the bottom lands. the musquetoes have not\r\nbeen troublesome to us since we left the whitebear islands.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 21, 1806]\r\nMonday July 21st 1806.\r\nWe set out at sunrise and proceeded a short distance up the North side\r\nof the river; we found the ravines which made in on this side were so\r\nsteep and numerous that we passed the river in doing which the pack\r\nhorse which carried my instruments missed the ford and wet the\r\ninstruments. this accident detained us about half an hor. I took the\r\nInstruments out wiped them and dryed their cases, they sustained no\r\nnaterial injury. we continued on the S. side of the river about 3 miles\r\nwhen we again passed over to the N. side and took our course through\r\nthe plains at some distance from the river. we saw a large herd of Elk\r\nthis morning. the buffaloe still become more scarce. at 2 P.M. we\r\nstruck a northern branch of Marias river about 30 yds. wide at the\r\ndistance of about 8 miles from it's entrance. this stream is closely\r\nconfined between clifts of freestone rocks the bottom narrow below us\r\nand above the rocks confine it on each side; some little timber below\r\nbut not any above; the water of this stream is nearly clear. from the\r\nappearance of this rock and the apparent hight of the bed of the streem\r\nI am induced to beleive that there are falls in these rivers somewhere\r\nabout their junction. being convinced that this stream came from the\r\nmountains I determined to pursue it as it will lead me to the most\r\nnothern point to which the waters of Maria's river extend which I now\r\nfear will not be as far north as I wished and expected. after dinner we\r\nset out up the North branch keeping on it's S. side; we pursued it\r\nuntill dark and not finding any timber halted and made a fire of the\r\ndung of the buffaloe. we lay on the south side in a narrow bottom under\r\na Clift. our provision is nearly out, we wounded a buffaloe this\r\nevening but could not get him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 22, 1806]\r\nTuesday July 22ed 1806.\r\nWe set out very early this morning as usual and proceeded up the river.\r\nfor the first seven miles of our travel this morning the country was\r\nbroken the land poor and intermixed with a greater quantity of gravel\r\nthan usual; the ravines were steep and numerous and our horses feet\r\nhave become extreemly soar in traveling over the gravel we therefore\r\ntraveled but slow. we met with a doe Elk which we wounded but did not\r\nget her. the river is confined closely between clifts of perpendicular\r\nrocks in most parts. after the distance of seven miles the country\r\nbecame more level les gravly and some bottoms to the river but not a\r\nparticle of timber nor underbush of any discription is to be seen. we\r\ncontinued up the river on it's South side for 17 miles when we halted\r\nto glaize our horses and eat; there being no wood we were compelled to\r\nmake our fire with the buffaloe dung which I found answered the purpose\r\nvery well. we cooked and eat all the meat we had except a small peice\r\nof buffaloe meat which was a little tainted. after dinner we passed the\r\nriver and took our course through a level and beautifull plain on the\r\nN. side. the country has now become level, the river bottoms wide and\r\nthe adjoining plains but little elivated above them; the banks of the\r\nriver are not usually more than from 3 to four feet yet it dose not\r\nappear ever to overflow them. we found no timber untill we had traveled\r\n12 miles further when we arrived at a clump of large cottonwood trees\r\nin a beautifull and extensive bottom of the river about 10 miles below\r\nthe foot of the rocky mountains where this river enters them; as I\r\ncould see from hence very distinctly where the river entered the\r\nmountains and the bearing of this point being S of West I thought it\r\nunnecessary to proceed further and therefore encamped resolving to rest\r\nourselves and horses a couple of days at this place and take the\r\nnecessary observations. this plain on which we are is very high; the\r\nrocky mountains to the S. W. of us appear but low from their base up\r\nyet are partially covered with snow nearly to their bases. there is no\r\ntimber on those mountains within our view; they are very irregular and\r\nbroken in their form and seem to be composed principally of clay with\r\nbut little rock or stone. the river appears to possess at least double\r\nthe vollume of water which it had where we first arrived on it below;\r\nthis no doubt proceeds from the avapparation caused by the sun and air\r\nand the absorbing of the earth in it's passage through these open\r\nplains. The course of the mountains still continues from S. E. to N. W.\r\nthe front rang appears to terminate abrubtly about 35 ms. to the N. W.\r\nOf us. I believe that the waters of the Suskashawan apporoach the\r\nborders of this river very nearly. I now have lost all hope of the\r\nwaters of this river ever extending to N Latitude 50° though I still hope\r\nand think it more than probable that both white earth river and milk\r\nriver extend as far north as latd. 50°--we have seen but few buffaloe\r\ntoday no deer and very few Antelopes; gam of every discription is\r\nextreemly wild which induces me to beleive that the indians are now, or\r\nhave been lately in this neighbourhood. we wounded a buffaloe this\r\nevening but our horses were so much fatiegued that we were unable to\r\npursue it with success.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 23, 1806]\r\nWednesdy July 23rd 1806\r\nI dispatched Drewyer an Joseph fields this morning to hunt. I directed\r\nDrewyer who went up the river to observe it's bearings and the point at\r\nwhich it entered the mountains, this he did and on his return I\r\nobserved the point at which the river entered to bear S 50° W. distant\r\nabout ten miles the river making a considerable bend to the West just\r\nabove us.\r\n\r\nboth these hunters returned unsuccessful and reported that there was no\r\ngame nor the appearance of any in this quarter. we now rendered the\r\ngrease from our tainted meat and made some mush of cows with a part of\r\nit, reserving as much meal of cows and grease as would afford us one\r\nmore meal tomorrow. Drewyer informed us that there was an indian camp\r\nof eleven leather lodges which appeared to have been abandoned about 10\r\ndays, the poles only of the lodges remained. we are confident that\r\nthese are the Minnetares of fort de prarie and suspect that they are\r\nprobably at this time somewhere on the main branch of Maria's river on\r\nthe borders of the buffaloe, under this impression I shall not strike\r\nthat river on my return untill about the mouth of the North branch.\r\nnear this place I observe a number of the whistleing squirrel of the\r\nspeceis common to the plains and country watered by the Columbia river,\r\nthis is the first instance in which I have found this squirrel in the\r\nplains of the Missouri. the Cottonwood of this place is also of the\r\nspeceis common to the Columbia. we have a delightfull pasture for our\r\nhorses where we are.\r\n\r\nThe clouds obscured the moon and put an end to further observation. the\r\nrok which makes its appearance on this part of the river is of a white\r\ncolour fine grit and makes excellet whetstones; it lies in horizontal\r\nstratas and makes it's appearance in the bluffs of the river near their\r\nbase. we indeavoured to take some fish but took only one small trout.\r\nMusquetoes uncommonly large and reather troublesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 24, 1806]\r\nThursday July 24th 1806.\r\nAt 8 A.M. the sun made it's appearance for a few minutes and I took\r\nit's altitude but it shortly after clouded up again and continued to\r\nrain the ballance of the day I was therefore unable to complete the\r\nobservations I wished to take at this place. I determined to remain\r\nanother day in the hope of it's being fair. we have still a little\r\nbread of cows remaining of which we made a kettle of mush which\r\ntogether with a few pigeons that we were fortunate enough to kill\r\nserved us with food for this day. I sent the hunters out but they\r\nshortly returned without having killed anything and declared that it\r\nwas useless to hunt within 6 or 8 miles of this place that there was no\r\nappearance of game within that distance. the air has become extreemly\r\ncold which in addition to the wind and rain renders our situation\r\nextreemly unpleasant. several wolves visited our camp today, I fired on\r\nand wounded one of them very badly. the small speceis of wolf barks\r\nlike a dog, they frequently salute us with this note as we pass through\r\nthe plains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 25, 1806]\r\nFriday July 25th 1806.\r\nThe weather still continues cold cloudy and rainy, the wind also has\r\nblown all day with more than usual violence from the N. W. this morning\r\nwe eat the last of our birds and cows, I therefore directed Drewyer and\r\nJ. Fields to take a couple of the horses and proceed to the S. E. as\r\nfar as the main branch of Maria's river which I expected was at no\r\ngreat distance and indeavour to kill some meat; they set out\r\nimmediately and I remained in camp with R. Fields to avail myself of\r\nevery opportunity to make my observations should any offer, but it\r\ncontinued to rain and I did not see the sun through the whole course of\r\nthe day R. Fields and myself killed nine pigeons which lit in the trees\r\nnear our camp on these we dined. late in the evening Drewyer and J.\r\nFields returned the former had killed a fine buck on which we now fared\r\nsumptuously. they informed me that it was about 10 miles to the main\r\nbranch of Maria's River, that the vally formed by the river in that\r\nquarter was wide extensive and level with a considerable quantity\r\ntimber; here they found some wintering camps of the natives and a great\r\nnumber of others of a more recent date or that had from appearance been\r\nevacuated about 6 weeks; we consider ourselves extreemly fortunate in\r\nnot having met with these people. I determined that if tomorrow\r\ncontinued cloudy to set out as I now begin to be apprehensive that I\r\nshall not reach the United States within this season unless I make\r\nevery exertion in my power which I shall certainly not omit when once I\r\nleave this place which I shall do with much reluctance without having\r\nobtained the necessary data to establish it's longitude-as if the fates\r\nwere against me my chronometer from some unknown cause stoped today,\r\nwhen I set her to going she went as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 26, 1806]\r\nSaturday July 26th 1806.\r\nThe moring was cloudy and continued to rain as usual, tho the cloud\r\nseemed somewhat thiner. I therefore posponed seting out untill 9 A.M.\r\nin the hope that it would clear off but finding the contrary result I\r\nhad the horses caught and we set out biding a lasting adieu to this\r\nplace which I now call camp disappointment. I took my rout through the\r\nopen plains S. E. 5 ms. passing a small creek at 2 ms. from the\r\nmountains wher I changed my direction to S. 75 E. for 7 ms. further and\r\nstruck a principal branch of Maria's river 65 yds. wide, not very deep,\r\nI passed this stream to it's south side and continued down it 2 ms. on\r\nthe last mentioned course when another branch of nearly the same\r\ndignity formed a junction with it, coming from the S. W. this last is\r\nshallow and rappid; has the appearance of overflowing it's banks\r\nfrequently and discharging vast torrants of water at certain seasons of\r\nthe year. the beds of both these streams are pebbly particularly the S.\r\nbranch. the water of the N. branch is very terbid while that of the S.\r\nbranch is nearly clear not withstanding the late rains. I passed the S.\r\nbranch just above it's junction and continued down the river which runs\r\na little to the N of E 1 ms. and halted to dine and graize our horses\r\nhere I found some indian lodges which appeared to have been inhabited\r\nlast winter in a large and fertile bottom well stocked with cottonwood\r\ntimber. the rose honeysuckle and redberry bushes constitute the\r\nundergrowth there being but little willow in this quarter both these\r\nrivers abov their junction appeared to be well stocked with timber or\r\ncomparitively so with other parts of this country. here it is that we\r\nfind the three species of cottonwood which I have remarked in my voyage\r\nassembled together that speceis common to the Columbia I have never\r\nbefore seen on the waters of the Missouri, also the narrow and broad\r\nleafed speceis. during our stay at this place R. Fields killed a buck a\r\npart of the flesh of which we took with us. we saw a few Antelopes some\r\nwolves and 2 of the smallest speceis of fox of a redish brown colour\r\nwith the extremity of the tail black. it is about the size of the\r\ncommon domestic cat and burrows in the plains. after dinner I continued\r\nmy rout down the river to the North of Eat about 3 ms. when the hills\r\nputting in close on the S side I determined to ascend them to the high\r\nplain which I did accordingly, keeping the Fields with me; Drewyer\r\npassed the river and kept down the vally of the river. I had intended\r\nto decend this river with it's course to it's junction with the fork\r\nwhich I had ascended and from thence have taken across the country\r\nobliquely to rose river and decend that stream to it's confluence with\r\nMaria's river. the country through which this portion of Maria's river\r\npasses to the fork which I ascended appears much more broken than that\r\nabove and between this and the mountains. I had scarcely ascended the\r\nhills before I discovered to my left at the distance of a mile an\r\nassembleage of about 30 horses, I halted and used my spye glass by the\r\nhelp of which I discovered several indians on the top of an eminence\r\njust above them who appeared to be looking down towards the river I\r\npresumed at Drewyer. about half the horses were saddled. this was a\r\nvery unpleasant sight, however I resolved to make the best of our\r\nsituation and to approach them in a friendly manner. I directed J.\r\nFields to display the flag which I had brought for that purpose and\r\nadvanced slowly toward them, about this time they discovered us and\r\nappeared to run about in a very confused manner as if much allarmed,\r\ntheir attention had been previously so fixed on Drewyer that they did\r\nnot discover us untill we had began to advance upon them, some of them\r\ndecended the hill on which they were and drove their horses within shot\r\nof it's summit and again returned to the hight as if to wate our\r\narrival or to defend themselves. I calculated on their number being\r\nnearly or quite equal to that of their horses, that our runing would\r\ninvite pursuit as it would convince them that we were their enimies and\r\nour horses were so indifferent that we could not hope to make our\r\nescape by flight; added to this Drewyer was seperated from us and I\r\nfeared that his not being apprized of the indians in the event of our\r\nattempting to escape he would most probably fall a sacrefice. under\r\nthese considerations I still advanced towards them; when we had arrived\r\nwithin a quarter of a mile of them, one of them mounted his horse and\r\nrode full speed towards us, which when I discovered I halted and\r\nalighted from my horse; he came within a hundred paces halted looked at\r\nus and turned his horse about and returned as briskly to his party as\r\nhe had advanced; while he halted near us I held out my hand and\r\nbecconed to him to approach but he paid no attention to my overtures.\r\non his return to his party they all decended the hill and mounted their\r\nhorses and advanced towards us leaving their horses behind them, we\r\nalso advanced to meet them. I counted eight of them but still supposed\r\nthat there were others concealed as there were several other horses\r\nsaddled. I told the two men with me that I apprehended that these were\r\nthe Minnetares of Fort de Prarie and from their known character I\r\nexpected that we were to have some difficulty with them; that if they\r\nthought themselves sufficiently strong I was convinced they would\r\nattempt to rob us in which case be their numbers what they would I\r\nshould resist to the last extremity prefering death to that of being\r\ndeprived of my papers instruments and gun and desired that they would\r\nform the same resolution and be allert and on their guard. when we\r\narrived within a hundred yards of each other the indians except one\r\nhalted I directed the two men with me to do the same and advanced\r\nsingly to meet the indian with whom I shook hands and passed on to\r\nthose in his rear, as he did also to the two men in my rear; we now all\r\nassembled and alighted from our horses; the Indians soon asked to smoke\r\nwith us, but I told them that the man whom they had seen pass down the\r\nriver had my pipe and we could not smoke untill he joined us. I\r\nrequested as they had seen which way he went that they would one of\r\nthem go with one of my men in surch of him, this they readily concented\r\nto and a young man set out with R. Fields in surch of Drewyer. I now\r\nasked them by sighns if they were the Minnetares of the North which\r\nthey answered in the affermative; I asked if there was any cheif among\r\nthem and they pointed out 3 I did not believe them however I thought it\r\nbest to please them and gave to one a medal to a second a flag and to\r\nthe third a handkercheif, with which they appeared well satisfyed. they\r\nappeared much agitated with our first interview from which they had\r\nscarcely yet recovered, in fact I beleive they were more allarmed at\r\nthis accedental interview than we were. from no more of them appearing\r\nI now concluded they were only eight in number and became much better\r\nsatisfyed with our situation as I was convinced that we could mannage\r\nthat number should they attempt any hostile measures. as it was growing\r\nlate in the evening I proposed that we should remove to the nearest\r\npart of the river and encamp together, I told them that I was glad to\r\nsee them and had a great deel to say to them. we mounted our horses and\r\nrode towards the river which was at but a short distance, on our way we\r\nwere joined by Drewyer Fields and the indian. we decended a very steep\r\nbluff about 250 feet high to the river where there was a small bottom\r\nof nearly 1/2 a mile in length and about 250 yards wide in the widest\r\npart, the river washed the bluffs both above and below us and through\r\nit's course in this part is very deep; the bluffs are so steep that\r\nthere are but few places where they could be ascended, and are broken\r\nin several places by deep nitches which extend back from the river\r\nseveral hundred yards, their bluffs being so steep that it is\r\nimpossible to ascend them; in this bottom there stand tree solitary\r\ntrees near one of which the indians formed a large simicircular camp of\r\ndressed buffaloe skins and invited us to partake of their shelter which\r\nDrewyer and myself accepted and the Fieldses lay near the fire in front\r\nof the sheter. with the assistance of Drewyer I had much conversation\r\nwith these people in the course of the evening. I learned from them\r\nthat they were a part of a large band which lay encamped at present\r\nnear the foot of the rocky mountains on the main branch of Maria's\r\nriver one 1/2 days march from our present encampment; that there was a\r\nwhiteman with their band; that there was another large band of their\r\nnation hunting buffaloe near the broken mountains and were on there way\r\nto the mouth of Maria's river where they would probably be in the\r\ncourse of a few days. they also informed us that from hence to the\r\nestablishment where they trade on the Suskasawan river is only 6 days\r\neasy march or such as they usually travel with their women and childred\r\nwhich may be estimated at about 150 ms. that from these traders they\r\nobtain arm amunition sperituous liquor blankets &c in exchange for\r\nwolves and some beaver skins. I told these people that I had come a\r\ngreat way from the East up the large river which runs towards the\r\nrising sun, that I had been to the great waters where the sun sets and\r\nhad seen a great many nations all of whom I had invited to come and\r\ntrade with me on the rivers on this side of the mountains, that I had\r\nfound most of them at war with their neighbours and had succeeded in\r\nrestoring peace among them, that I was now on my way home and had left\r\nmy party at the falls of the missouri with orders to decend that river\r\nto the entrance of Maria's river and there wait my arrival and that I\r\nhad come in surch of them in order to prevail on them to be at peace\r\nwith their neighbours particularly those on the West side of the\r\nmountains and to engage them to come and trade with me when the\r\nestablishment is made at the entrance of this river to all which they\r\nreadily gave their assent and declared it to be their wish to be at\r\npeace with the Tushepahs whom they said had killed a number of their\r\nrelations lately and pointed to several of those present who had cut\r\ntheir hair as an evidince of the truth of what they had asserted. I\r\nfound them extreemly fond of smoking and plyed them with the pipe\r\nuntill late at night. I told them that if they intended to do as I\r\nwished them they would send some of their young men to their band with\r\nan invitation to their chiefs and warriors to bring the whiteman with\r\nthem and come down and council with me at the entrance of Maria's river\r\nand that the ballance of them would accompany me to that place, where I\r\nwas anxious now to meet my men as I had been absent from them some time\r\nand knew that they would be uneasy untill they saw me. that if they\r\nwould go with me I would give them 10 horses and some tobacco. to this\r\nproposition they made no reply, I took the first watch tonight and set\r\nup untill half after eleven; the indians by this time were all asleep,\r\nI roused up R. Fields and laid down myself; I directed Fields to watch\r\nthe movements of the indians and if any of them left the camp to awake\r\nus all as I apprehended they would attampt to seal steal our horses.\r\nthis being done I fell into a profound sleep and did not wake untill\r\nthe noise of the men and indians awoke me a little after light in the\r\nmorning.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 27, 1806]\r\nJuly 27th 1806 Sunday.\r\nThis morning at day light the indians got up and crouded around the\r\nfire, J. Fields who was on post had carelessly laid his gun down behid\r\nhim near where his brother was sleeping, one of the indians the fellow\r\nto whom I had given the medal last evening sliped behind him and took\r\nhis gun and that of his brothers unperceived by him, at the same\r\ninstant two others advanced and seized the guns of Drewyer and myself,\r\nJ. Fields seing this turned about to look for his gun and saw the\r\nfellow just runing off with her and his brothers he called to his\r\nbrother who instantly jumped up and pursued the indian with him whom\r\nthey overtook at the distance of 50 or 60 paces from the camp sized\r\ntheir guns and rested them from him and R Fields as he seized his gun\r\nstabed the indian to the heart with his knife the fellow ran about 15\r\nsteps and fell dead; of this I did not know untill afterwards, having\r\nrecovered their guns they ran back instantly to the camp; Drewyer who\r\nwas awake saw the indian take hold of his gun and instantly jumped up\r\nand sized her and rested her from him but the indian still retained his\r\npouch, his jumping up and crying damn you let go my gun awakened me I\r\njumped up and asked what was the matter which I quickly learned when I\r\nsaw drewyer in a scuffle with the indian for his gun. I reached to\r\nseize my gun but found her gone, I then drew a pistol from my holster\r\nand terning myself about saw the indian making off with my gun I ran at\r\nhim with my pistol and bid him lay down my gun which he was in the act\r\nof doing when the Fieldses returned and drew up their guns to shoot him\r\nwhich I forbid as he did not appear to be about to make any resistance\r\nor commit any offensive act, he droped the gun and walked slowly off, I\r\npicked her up instantly, Drewyer having about this time recovered his\r\ngun and pouch asked me if he might not kill the fellow which I also\r\nforbid as the indian did not appear to wish to kill us, as soon as they\r\nfound us all in possession of our arms they ran and indeavored to drive\r\noff all the horses I now hollowed to the men and told them to fire on\r\nthem if they attempted to drive off our horses, they accordingly\r\npursued the main party who were drying the horses up the river and I\r\npursued the man who had taken my gun who with another was driving off a\r\npart of the horses which were to the left of the camp, I pursued them\r\nso closely that they could not take twelve of their own horses but\r\ncontinued to drive one of mine with some others; at the distance of\r\nthree hundred paces they entered one of those steep nitches in the\r\nbluff with the horses before them being nearly out of breath I could\r\npursue no further, I called to them as I had done several times before\r\nthat I would shoot them if they did not give me my horse and raised my\r\ngun, one of them jumped behind a rock and spoke to the other who turned\r\narround and stoped at the distance of 30 steps from me and I shot him\r\nthrough the belly, he fell to his knees and on his wright elbow from\r\nwhich position he partly raised himself up and fired at me, and turning\r\nhimself about crawled in behind a rock which was a few feet from him.\r\nhe overshot me, being bearheaded I felt the wind of his bullet very\r\ndistinctly. not having my shotpouch I could not reload my peice and as\r\nthere were two of them behind good shelters from me I did not think it\r\nprudent to rush on them with my pistol which had I discharged I had not\r\nthe means of reloading untill I reached camp; I therefore returned\r\nleasurely towards camp, on my way I met with Drewyer who having heared\r\nthe report of the guns had returned in surch of me and left the Fieldes\r\nto pursue the indians, I desired him to haisten to the camp with me and\r\nassist in catching as many of the indian horses as were necessary and\r\nto call to the Fieldes if he could make them hear to come back that we\r\nstill had a sufficient number of horses, this he did but they were too\r\nfar to hear him. we reached the camp and began to catch the horses and\r\nsaddle them and put on the packs. the reason I had not my pouch with me\r\nwas that I had not time to return about 50 yards to camp after geting\r\nmy gun before I was obliged to pursue the indians or suffer them to\r\ncollect and drive off all the horses. we had caught and saddled the\r\nhorses and began to arrange the packs when the Fieldses returned with\r\nfour of our horses; we left one of our horses and took four of the best\r\nof those of the indian's; while the men were preparing the horses I put\r\nfour sheilds and two bows and quivers of arrows which had been left on\r\nthe fire, with sundry other articles; they left all their baggage at\r\nour mercy. they had but 2 guns and one of them they left the others\r\nwere armed with bows and arrows and eyedaggs. the gun we took with us.\r\nI also retook the flagg but left the medal about the neck of the dead\r\nman that they might be informed who we were. we took some of their\r\nbuffaloe meat and set out ascending the bluffs by the same rout we had\r\ndecended last evening leaving the ballance of nine of their horses\r\nwhich we did not want. the Feildses told me that three of the indians\r\nwhom they pursued swam the river one of them on my horse. and that two\r\nothers ascended the hill and escaped from them with a part of their\r\nhorses, two I had pursued into the nitch one lay dead near the camp and\r\nthe eighth we could not account for but suppose that he ran off early\r\nin the contest. having ascended the hill we took our course through a\r\nbeatiful level plain a little to the S of East. my design was to hasten\r\nto the entrance of Maria's river as quick as possible in the hope of\r\nmeeting with the canoes and party at that place having no doubt but\r\nthat they would pursue us with a large party and as there was a band\r\nnear the broken mountains or probably between them and the mouth of\r\nthat river we might expect them to receive inteligence from us and\r\narrive at that place nearly as soon as we could, no time was therefore\r\nto be lost and we pushed our horses as hard as they would bear. at 8\r\nmiles we passed a large branch 40 yds. wide which I called battle\r\nriver. at 3 P.M. we arrived at rose river about 5 miles above where we h\r\nad passed it as we went out, having traveled by my estimate compared\r\nwith our former distances and couses about 63 ms. here we halted an\r\nhour and a half took some refreshment and suffered our horses to\r\ngraize; the day proved warm but the late rains had supplyed the little\r\nreservors in the plains with water and had put them in fine order for\r\ntraveling, our whole rout so far was as level as a bowling green with\r\nbut little stone and few prickly pears. after dinner we pursued the\r\nbottoms of rose river but finding inconvenient to pass the river so\r\noften we again ascended the hills on the S. W. side and took the open\r\nplains; by dark we had traveled about 17 miles further, we now halted\r\nto rest ourselves and horses about 2 hours, we killed a buffaloe cow\r\nand took a small quantity of the meat. after refreshing ourselves we\r\nagain set out by moon light and traveled leasurely, heavy thunderclouds\r\nlowered arround us on every quarter but that from which the moon gave\r\nus light. we continued to pass immence herds of buffaloe all night as\r\nwe had done in the latter part of the day. we traveled untill 2 OCk in\r\nthe morning having come by my estimate after dark about 20 ms. we now\r\nturned out our horses and laid ourselves down to rest in the plain very\r\nmuch fatiegued as may be readily conceived. my indian horse carried me\r\nvery well in short much better than my own would have done and leaves\r\nme with but little reason to complain of the robery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 28, 1806]\r\nJuly 28th 1806 Monday.\r\nThe morning proved fair, I slept sound but fortunately awoke as day\r\nappeared, I awaked the men and directed the horses to be saddled, I was\r\nso soar from my ride yesterday that I could scarcely stand, and the men\r\ncomplained of being in a similar situation however I encourged them by\r\ntelling them that our own lives as well as those of our friends and\r\nfellow travellers depended on our exertions at this moment; they were\r\nallert soon prepared the horses and we again resumed our march; the men\r\nproposed to pass the missouri at the grog spring where rose river\r\napproaches it so nearly and pass down on the S. W. side, to this I\r\nobjected as it would delay us almost all day to reach the point by this\r\ncircuetous rout and would give the enemy time to surprise and cut off\r\nthe party at the point if they had arrived there, I told them that we\r\nowed much to the safety of our friends and that we must wrisk our lives\r\non this occasion, that I should proceed immediately to the point and if\r\nthe party had not arrived that I would raft the missouri a small\r\ndistance above, hide our baggage and march on foot up the river through\r\nthe timber untill I met the canoes or joined them at the falls; I now\r\ntold them that it was my determination that if we were attacked in the\r\nplains on our way to the point that the bridles of the horses should be\r\ntied together and we would stand and defend them, or sell our lives as\r\ndear as we could. we had proceeded about 12 miles on an East course\r\nwhen we found ourselves near the missouri; we heared a report which we\r\ntook to be that of a gun but were not certain; still continuing down\r\nthe N. E. bank of the missouri about 8 miles further, being then within\r\nfive miles of the grog spring we heared the report of several rifles\r\nvery distinctly on the river to our right, we quickly repared to this\r\njoyfull sound and on arriving at the bank of the river had the\r\nunspeakable satisfaction to see our canoes coming down. we hurried down\r\nfrom the bluff on which we were and joined them striped our horses and\r\ngave them a final discharge imbrarking without loss of time with our\r\nbaggage. I now learned that they had brought all things safe having\r\nsustaned no loss nor met with any accident of importance. Wiser had cut\r\nhis leg badly with a knife and was unable in consequence to work. we\r\ndecended the river opposite to our principal cash which we proceeded to\r\nopen after reconnoitering the adjacent country. we found that the cash\r\nhad caved in and most of the articles burried therin were injured; I\r\nsustained the loss of two very large bear skins which I much regret;\r\nmost of the fur and baggage belonging to the men were injured. the\r\ngunpowder corn flour poark and salt had sustained but little injury the\r\nparched meal was spoiled or nearly so. having no time to air these\r\nthings which they much wanted we droped down to the point to take in\r\nthe several articles which had been buried at that place in several\r\nsmall cashes; these we found in good order, and recovered every article\r\nexcept 3 traps belonging to Drewyer which could not be found. here as\r\ngood fortune would have it Sergt. Gass and Willard who brought the\r\nhorses from the falls joined us at 1 P.M. I had ordered them to bring\r\ndown the horses to this place in order to assist them in collecting\r\nmeat which I had directed them to kill and dry here for our voyage,\r\npresuming that they would have arrived with the perogue and canoes at\r\nthis place several days before my return. having now nothing to detain\r\nus we passed over immediately to the island in the entrance of Maria's\r\nriver to launch the red perogue, but found her so much decayed that it\r\nwas impossible with the means we had to repare her and therefore mearly\r\ntook the nails and other ironwork's about her which might be of service\r\nto us and left her. we now reimbarked on board the white peroge and\r\nfive small canoes and decended the river about 15 ms. and encamped on\r\nthe S. W. side near a few cottonwood trees, one of them being of the\r\nnarrow leafed speceis and was the first of that kind which we had\r\nremarked on our passage up the river. we encamped late but having\r\nlittle meat I sent out a couple of hunters who soon returned with a\r\nsufficient quantity of the flesh of a fat cow. there are immence\r\nquantities of buffaloe and Elk about the junction of the Missouri and\r\nMaria's rivers.--during the time we halted at the er.crance of Maria's\r\nriver we experienced a very heavy shower of rain and hail attended with\r\nviolent thunder and lightning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 29, 1806]\r\nTuesday July 29th 1806.\r\nShortly after dark last evening a violent storm came on from N. W.\r\nattended with rain hail Thunder and lightning which continued the\r\ngreater part of the night. no having the means of making a shelter I\r\nlay in the water all night. the rain continued with but little\r\nintermission all day. I intend halting as soon as the weather proves\r\nfair in order to dry our baggage which much wants it. I placed the two\r\nFieldses and Colter and Collins in the two smallest canoes with orderes\r\nto hunt, and kill meat for the party and obtain as many Elkskins as are\r\nnecessary to cover our canoes and furnish us with shelters from the\r\nrain. we set out early and the currant being strong we proceeded with\r\ngreat rapidity. at 11 A.M. we passed that very interesting part of the\r\nMissouri where the natural walls appear, particularly discribed in my\r\noutward bound journey. we continued our rout untill late in the evening\r\nand encamped on the N. E. side of the river at the same place we had\r\nencamped on the 29th of May 1805. on our way today we killed 9 bighorns\r\nof which I preserved the skins and skeletons of 2 females and one male;\r\nthe flesh of this aninmal is extreemly delicate tender and well\r\nflavored, they are now in fine order. their flesh both in colour and\r\nflavor much resembles mutton though it is not so strong as our mutton.\r\nthe eye is large and prominant, the puple of a pale sea green and iris\r\nof a light yellowish brown colour. these animals abound in this quarter\r\nkeeping themselves principally confined to the steep clifts and bluffs\r\nof the river. we saw immence hirds of buffaloe in the high plains today\r\non either hand of the river. saw but few Elk. the brown Curloo has left\r\nthe plains I presume it has raised it's young and retired to some other\r\nclimate and country. as I have been very particular in my discription\r\nof the country as I ascended this river I presume it is unnecesssesary\r\nhere to add any-thing further on that subject. the river is now nearly\r\nas high as it has been this season and is so thick with mud and sand\r\nthat it is with difficulty I can drink it. every little rivulet now\r\ndischarges a torrant of water bringing down immece boddies of mud sand\r\nand filth from the plains and broken bluffs.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 30, 1806]\r\nWednesday July 30th 1806.\r\nThe rain still continued this morning it was therefore unnecessary to\r\nremain as we could not dry our baggage I Consequently set out early as\r\nusual and pursued my rout downwards. the currant being strong and the\r\nmen anxious to get on they plyed their oars faithfully and we went at\r\nthe rate of about seven miles an hour. we halted several times in the\r\ncourse of the day to kill some bighorns being anxious to procure a few\r\nmore skins and skeletons of this animal; I was fortunate enough to\r\nprocure one other malle and female for this purpose which I had\r\nprepared accordingly. seven others were killed by the party also 2\r\nbuffaloe one Elk 2 beaver with & a female brown bear with tallons 61/4\r\ninches in length. I preserved the skin of this bear also with the\r\ntallons; it was not large and in but low order. we arrived this evening\r\nat an island about 2 ms. above Goodriches Island and encamped on it's\r\nN. E. side. the rain continued with but little intermission all day;\r\nthe air is cold and extreemly disagreeable. nothing extraordinary\r\nhappened today\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, July 31, 1806]\r\nThursday July 31st 1806.\r\nThe rain still continuing I set out early and proceeded on as fast as\r\npossible. at 9 A.M. we fell in with a large herd of Elk of which we\r\nkilled 15 and took their skins. the bottoms in the latter part of the\r\nday became wider better timbered and abound in game. the party killed\r\n14 deer in the course of the day without attempting to hunt but little\r\nfor them. we also killed 2 bighorns and 1 beaver; saw but few buffaloe.\r\nthe river is still rising and excessively muddy more so I think than I\r\never saw it. we experienced some very heavy showers of rain today. we\r\nhave been passing high pine hills all day. late in the evening we came\r\ntoo on the N. E. side of the river and took sheter in some indian\r\nlodges built of sticks, about 8 ms. below the entrance of North\r\nmountain creek. these lodges appeared to have been built in the course\r\nof the last winter. these lodges with the addition of some Elk skins\r\nafforded us a good shelter from the rain which continued to fall\r\npowerfully all night. I think it probable that the minnetares of Fort\r\nde Prarie visit this part of the river; we meet with their old lodges\r\nin every bottom.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 1, 1806]\r\nFriday August 1st 1806.\r\nThe rain still continuing I set out early as usual and proceeded on at\r\na good rate. at 9 A.M. we saw a large brown bear swiming from an island\r\nto the main shore we pursued him and as he landed Drewyer and myself\r\nshot and killed him; we took him on board the perogue and continued our\r\nrout. at 11 A.M. we passed the entrance of Mussel shell river. at 1 in\r\nthe evening we arrived at a bottom on S. W. side where there were\r\nseveral spacious Indian lodges built of sticks and an excellent\r\nlanding. as the rain still continued with but little intermission and\r\nappearances seemed unfavorable to it's becomeing fair shortly, I\r\ndetermined to halt at this place at least for this evening and\r\nindeavour to dry my skins of the bighorn which had every appearance of\r\nspoiling, an event which I would not should happen on any consideration\r\nas we have now passed the country in which they are found and I\r\ntherefore could not supply the deficiency were I to loose these I have.\r\nI halted at this place being about 15 ms. below Missel shell river, had\r\nfires built in the lodges and my skins exposed to dry. shortly after we\r\nlanded the rain ceased tho it still continued cloudy all this evening.\r\na white bear came within 50 paces of our camp before we perceived it;\r\nit stood erect on it's hinder feet and looked at us with much apparent\r\nunconsern, we seized our guns which are always by us and several of us\r\nfired at it and killed it. it was a female in fine order, we fleesed it\r\nand extracted several gallons of oil. this speceis of bar are rearly as\r\npoor at this season of the year as the common black bear nor are they\r\never as fat as the black bear is found in winter; as they feed\r\nprincipally on flesh, like the wolf, they are most fatt when they can\r\nprocure a sufficiency of food without rispect to the season of the\r\nyear. the oil of this bear is much harder than that of the black bear\r\nbeing nearly as much so as the lard of a hog. the flesh is by no means\r\nas agreeable as that of the black bear, or Yahkah or partycoloured bear\r\nof the West side of the rocky mountains. on our way today we killed a\r\nbuck Elk in fine order the skins and a part of the flesh of which we\r\npreserved. after encamping this evening the hunters killed 4 deer and a\r\nbeaver. The Elk are now in fine order particularly the males. their\r\nhorns have obtained their full growth but have not yet shed the velvet\r\nor skin which covers them. the does are found in large herds with their\r\nyoung and a few young bucks with them. the old bucks yet herd together\r\nin parties of two to 7 or 8.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 2, 1806]\r\nSaturday August 2cd 1806.\r\nThe morning proved fair and I determined to remain all day and dry the\r\nbaggage and give the men an opportunity to dry and air their skins and\r\nfurr. had the powder parched meal and every article which wanted drying\r\nexposed to the sun. the day proved warm fair and favourable for our\r\npurpose. I permitted the Fieldses to go on a few miles to hunt. by\r\nevening we had dryed our baggage and repacked it in readiness to load\r\nand set out early in the morning. the river fell 18 inches since\r\nyesterday evening. the hunters killed several deer in the course of the\r\nday. nothing remarkable took place today. we are all extreemly anxious\r\nto reach the entrance of the Yellowstone river where we expect to join\r\nCapt. Clark and party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 3, 1806]\r\nSaturday August 3rd 1806.\r\nI arrose early this morning and had the perogue and canoes loaded and\r\nset out at half after 6 A.M. we soon passed the canoe of Colter and\r\nCollins who were on shore hunting, the men hailed them but received no\r\nanswer we proceeded, and shortly after overtook J. and R. Fields who\r\nhad killed 25 deer since they left us yesterday; deer are very abundant\r\nin the timbered bottoms of the river and extreemly gentle. we did not\r\nhalt today to cook and dine as usual having directed that in future the\r\nparty should cook as much meat in the evening after encamping as would\r\nbe sufficient to serve them the next day; by this means we forward our\r\njourney at least 12 or 15 miles Pr. day. we saw but few buffaloe in the\r\ncourse of this day, tho a great number of Elk, deer, wolves, some bear,\r\nbeaver, geese a few ducks, the party coloured covus, one Callamet\r\nEagle, a number of bald Eagles, redheaded woodpeckers &c. we encamped\r\nthis evening on N. E. side of the river 2 ms. above our encampment of\r\nthe 12th of May 1805 soon after we encamp Drewyer killed a fat doe. the\r\nFieldses arrived at dark with the flesh of two fine bucks, besides\r\nwhich they had killed two does since we passed them making in all 29\r\ndeer since yesterday morning. Collins and Colter did not overtake us\r\nthis evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 4, 1806]\r\nMonday August 4th 1806.\r\nSet out at 4 A.M. this morning. permited Willard and Sergt. Ordway to\r\nexchange with the Feildses and take their small canoe to hunt to-day.\r\nat 1/2 after eleven O'Ck. passed the entrance of big dry river; found\r\nthe water in this river about 60 yds. wide tho shallow. it runs with a\r\nboald even currant. at 3 P.M. we arrived at the entrance of Milk river\r\nwhere we halted a few minutes. this stream is full at present and it's\r\nwater is much the colour of that of the Missouri; it affords as much\r\nwater at present as Maria's river and I have no doubt extends itself to\r\na considerable distance North. during our halt we killed a very large\r\nrattlesnake of the speceis common to our country. it had 176 scuta on\r\nthe abdomen and 25 on the tail, it's length 5 feet. the scutae on the\r\ntail fully formed. after passing this river we saw several large herds\r\nof buffaloe and Elk we killed one of each of these animals and took as\r\nmuch of the flesh as we wished. we encamped this evening two miles\r\nbelow the gulph on the N. E. side of the river. Tonight for the first\r\ntime this season I heard the small whippoorwill or goatsucker of the\r\nMissouri cry. Colter and Collins have not yet overtaken us. Ordway and\r\nWillard delayed so much time in hunting today that they did not\r\novertake us untill about midnight. they killed one bear and 2 deer. in\r\npassing a bend just below the gulph it being dark they were drawn by\r\nthe currant in among a parsel of sawyers, under one of which the canoe\r\nwas driven and throwed Willard who was steering overboard; he caught\r\nthe sawyer and held by it; Ordway with the canoe drifted down about\r\nhalf a mile among the sawyers under a falling bank, the canoe struck\r\nfrequently but did not overset; he at length gained the shore and\r\nreturned by land to learn the fate of Willard whom he found was yet on\r\nthe sawyer; it was impossible for him to take the canoe to his relief\r\nWillard at length tied a couple of sticks together which had lodged\r\nagainst the sawyer on which he was and set himself a drift among the\r\nsawyers which he fortunately escaped and was taken up about a mile\r\nbelow by Ordway with the canoe; they sustained no loss on this\r\noccasion. it was fortunate for Willard that he could swim tolerably\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 5, 1806]\r\nTuesday August 5th 1806.\r\nColter and Collins not having arrived induced me to remain this morning\r\nfor them. the hunters killed four deer this morning near our\r\nencampment. I remained untill noon when I again reimbarked and set out\r\nconcluding that as Colter and Collins had not arrived by that time that\r\nthey had passed us after dark the night of the 3rd inst. as Sergt\r\nOrdway informed me he should have done last evening had not the\r\ncentinel hailed him. we continued our rout untill late in the evening\r\nwhen I came too and encamped on the South side about 10 miles below\r\nlittle dry river. on our way we killed a fat cow and took as much of\r\nthe flesh as was necessary for us. The Feildses killed 2 large bear\r\nthis evening one of them measured nine feet from the extremity of the\r\nnose to that of his tail, this is the largest bear except one that I\r\nhave seen. we saw several bear today as we passed but did not kill any\r\nof them. we also saw on our way immence herds of buffaloe & Elk, many\r\ndeer Antelopes, wolves, geese Eagles &c. but few ducks or prarie hens.\r\nthe geese cannot fly at present; I saw a solitary Pillacon the other\r\nday in the same situation. this happens from their sheding or casting\r\nthe fathers of the wings at this season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 6, 1806]\r\nWednesday August 6th 1806.\r\nA little after dark last evening a violent storm arrose to the N. E.\r\nand shortly after came on attended with violent Thunder lightning and\r\nsome hail; the rain fell in a mere torrant and the wind blew so\r\nviolently that it was with difficulty I could have the small canoes\r\nunloaded before they filled with water; they sustained no injury. our\r\nsituation was open and exposed to the storm. in attending to the canoes\r\nI got wet to the skin and having no shelter on land I betook myself to\r\nthe orning of the perogue which I had, formed of Elkskin, here I\r\nobtained a few hours of broken rest; the wind and rain continued almost\r\nall night and the air became very cold. we set out early this morning\r\nand decended the river about 10 miles below Porcupine river when the\r\nwind became so violent that I laid by untill 4 P.M. the wind then\r\nabaiting in some measure we again resumed our voyage, and decended the\r\nriver about 5 miles below our encampment of the 1st of May 1805 where\r\nwe halted for the night on the S. W. side of the river. after halting\r\nwe killed three fat cows and a buck. we had previously killed today 4\r\ndeer a buck Elk and a fat cow. in short game is so abundant and gentle\r\nthat we kill it when we please. the Feildses went on ahead this evening\r\nand we did not overtake them. we saw several bear in the course of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 7, 1806]\r\nThursday August 7th 1806.\r\nIt began to rain about midnight and continued with but little\r\nintermission until 10 A.M. today. the air was cold and extreemly\r\nunpleasant. we set out early resolving if possible to reach the\r\nYelowstone river today which was at the distance of 83 ms. from our\r\nencampment of the last evening; the currant favoured our progress being\r\nmore rapid than yesterday, the men plyed their oars faithfully and we\r\nwent at a good rate. at 8 A.M. we passed the entrance of Marthy's river\r\nwhich has changed it's entrance since we passed it last year, falling\r\nin at preasent about a quarter of a mile lower down. at or just below\r\nthe entrance of this river we meet with the first appearance of Coal\r\nbirnt hills and pumicestone, these appearances seem to be coextensive.\r\nhere it is also that we find the first Elm and dwarf cedar on the\r\nbluffs, the ash first appears in the instance of one solletary tree at\r\nthe Ash rapid, about the Elk rapid and from thence down we occasionly\r\nmeet with it scattered through the bottoms but it is generally small.\r\nfrom Marthy's river to Milk river on the N. E. side there is a most\r\nbeautifull level plain country; the soil is much more fertile here than\r\nabove. we overtook the Feildses at noon. they had killed 2 bear and\r\nseen 6 others, we saw and fired on two from our perogue but killed\r\nneither of them. these bear resort the river where they lie in wate at\r\nthe crossing places of the game for the Elk and weak cattle; when they\r\nprocure a subject of either they lie by the carcase and keep the wolves\r\noff untill they devour it. the bear appear to be very abundant on this\r\npart of the river. we saw a number of buffaloe Elk &c as we passed but\r\ndid not detain to kill any of them. we also saw an unusual flight of\r\nwhite gulls about the size of a pigeon with the top of their heads\r\nblack. at 4 P.M. we arrived at the entrance of the Yellowstone river. I\r\nlanded at the point and found that Capt. Clark had been encamped at\r\nthis place and from appearances had left it about 7 or 8 days. I found\r\na paper on a pole at the point which mearly contained my name in the\r\nhand wrighting of Capt. C. we also found the remnant of a note which\r\nhad been attatched to a peace of Elk's horns in the camp; from this\r\nfragment I learned that game was scarce at the point and musquetoes\r\ntroublesome which were the reasons given for his going on; I also\r\nlearnt that he intended halting a few miles below where he intended\r\nwaiting my arrival. I now wrote a note directed to Colter and Collins\r\nprovided they were behind, ordering them to come on without loss of\r\ntime; this note I wraped in leather and attatced onto the same pole\r\nwhich Capt. C. had planted at the point; this being done I instantly\r\nreimbarked and decended the river in the hope of reaching Capt. C's\r\ncamp before night. about 7 miles below the point on the S. W. shore I\r\nsaw some meat that had been lately fleased and hung on a pole; I\r\ndirected Sergt. Ordway to go on shore examine the place; on his return\r\nhe reported that he saw the tracks of two men which appeared so resent\r\nthat he beleived they had been there today, the fire he found at the\r\nplce was blaizing and appeared to have been mended up afresh or within\r\nthe course of an hour past. he found at this place a part of a Chinnook\r\nhat which my men recognized as the hat of Gibson; from these\r\ncircumstances we included that Capt. C's camp could not be distant and\r\npursued our rout untill dark with the hope of reaching his camp in this\r\nhowever we were disappointed and night coming on compelled us to encamp\r\non the N. E. shore in the next bottom above our encampment of the 23rd\r\nand 24th of April 1805. as we came too a herd of buffaloe assembled on\r\nthe shore of which we killed a fat cow.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 8, 1806]\r\nFriday August 8th 1806.\r\nBeleiving from the recent appearances about the fire which we past last\r\nevening that Capt Clark could be at no great distance below I set out\r\nearly; the wind heard from the N. E. but by the force of the oars and\r\ncurrant we traveled at a good rate untill 10 A.M. by which time we\r\nreached the center of the beaver bends about 8 ms. by water and 3 by\r\nland above the entrance of White earth river. not finding Capt. Clark I\r\nknew not what calculation to make with rispect to his halting and\r\ntherefore determined to proceed as tho he was not before me and leave\r\nthe rest to the chapter of accedents. at this place I found a good\r\nbeach for the purpose of drawing out the perogue and one of the canoes\r\nwhich wanted corking and reparing. the men with me have not had leasure\r\nsince we left the West side of the Rocky mountains to dress any skins\r\nor make themselves cloaths and most of them are therefore extreemly\r\nbare. I therefore determined to halt at this place untill the perogue\r\nand canoe could be repared and the men dress skins and make themselves\r\nthe necessary cloathing. we encamped on the N. E. side of the river; we\r\nfound the Musquetoes extreemly troublesome but in this rispect there is\r\nbut little choise of camps from hence down to St. Louis. from this\r\nplace to the little Missouri there is an abundance of game I shall\r\ntherefore when I leave this place travel at my leasure and avail myself\r\nof every opportunity to collect and dry meat untill I provide a\r\nsufficient quantity for our voyage not knowing what provision Capt C.\r\nhas made in this rispect. I formed a camp unloaded the canoes and\r\nperogue, had the latter and one of the canoes drawn out to dry, fleased\r\nwhat meat we had collected and hung it on poles in the sun, after which\r\nthe men busied themselves in dressing skins and making themselves\r\ncloaths. Drewyer killed 2 Elk and a deer this evening. the air is cold\r\nyet the Musquetoes continue to be troublesome.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 9, 1806]\r\nSaturday August 9th 1806.\r\nThe day proved fair and favourable for our purposes. the men were all\r\nengaged dressing skins and making themselves cloathes except R & J.\r\nFields whom I sent this morning over the river with orders to proceed\r\nto the entrance of the White earth river in surch of Capt. C. and to\r\nhunt and kill Elk or buffaloe should they find any convenient to the\r\nriver. in the evening these men returned and informed me that they saw\r\nno appearance of Capt. Clark or party. they found no game nor was there\r\na buffaloe.to be seen in the plains as far as the eye could reach.\r\nnothing remarkable took place in the course of the day. Colter and\r\nCollins have not yet overtaken us I fear some missfortune has happened\r\nthem for their previous fidelity and orderly deportment induces me to\r\nbeleive that they would not thus intentionally delay. the Perogue is\r\nnot yet sufficiently dry for reparing. we have no pitch and will\r\ntherefore be compelled to use coal and tallow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 10, 1806]\r\nSunday August 10th 1806.\r\nThe morning was somewhat cloudy I therefore apprehended rain however it\r\nshortly after became fair. I hastened the repairs which were necessary\r\nto the perogue and canoe which were compleated by 2 P.M. those not\r\nengaged about this business employed themselves as yester-day. at 4 in\r\nthe evening it clouded up and began to rain which puting a stop to the\r\nopperation of skindressing we had nothing further to detain us, I\r\ntherefore directed the vessels to be loaded and at 5 P.M. got under way\r\nthe wind has blown very hard all day but did not prove so much so this\r\nevening as absolutely to detain us. we decended this evening as low\r\nnearly as the entrance of white Earth river and encamped on the S. W.\r\nside. the musquetoes more than usually troublesome this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 11, 1806]\r\nMonday August 11th 1806.\r\nWe set out very early this morning. it being my wish to arrive at the\r\nbirnt hills by noon in order to take the latitude of that place as it\r\nis the most northern point of the Missouri, enformed the party of my\r\ndesign and requested that they would exert themselves to reach the\r\nplace in time as it would save us the delay of nearly one day; being as\r\nanxious to get forward as I was they plyed their oars faithfully and we\r\nproceeded rapidly. I had instructed the small canoes that if they saw\r\nany game on the river to halt and kill it and follow on; however we saw\r\nbut little game untill about 9 A.M. when we came up with a buffaloe\r\nswiming the river which I shot and killed; leaving the small canoes to\r\ndress it and bring on the meat I proceeded. we had gone but little way\r\nbefore I saw a very large grizzly bear and put too in order to kill it,\r\nbut it took wind of us and ran off. the small canoes overtook us and\r\ninformed that the flesh of the buffaloe was unfit for uce and that they\r\nhad therefore left it half after 11 A.M. we saw a large herd of Elk on\r\nthe N. E. shore and I directed the men in the small canoes to halt and\r\nkill some of them and continued on in the perogue to the birnt hills;\r\nwhen I arrived here it was about 20 minutes after noon and of course\r\nthe observation for the O's meridian Altitude was lost; jus opposite to\r\nthe birnt hills there happened to be a herd of Elk on a thick willow\r\nbar and finding that my observation was lost for the present I\r\ndetermined to land and kill some of them accordingly we put too and I\r\nwent out with Cruzatte only. we fired on the Elk I killed one and he\r\nwounded another, we reloaded our guns and took different routs through\r\nthe thick willows in pursuit of the Elk; I was in the act of firing on\r\nthe Elk a second time when a ball struck my left thye about an inch\r\nbelow my hip joint, missing the bone it passed through the left thye\r\nand cut the thickness of the bullet across the hinder part of the right\r\nthye; the stroke was very severe; I instantly supposed that Cruzatte\r\nhad shot me in mistake for an Elk as I was dressed in brown leather and\r\nhe cannot see very well; under this impression I called out to him damn\r\nyou, you have shot me, and looked towards the place from whence the\r\nball had come, seeing nothing I called Cruzatte several times as loud\r\nas I could but received no answer; I was now preswaded that it was an\r\nindian that had shot me as the report of the gun did not appear to be\r\nmore than 40 paces from me and Cruzatte appeared to be out of hearing\r\nof me; in this situation not knowing how many indians there might be\r\nconcealed in the bushes I thought best to make good my retreat to the\r\nperogue, calling out as I ran for the first hundred paces as loud as I\r\ncould to Cruzatte to retreat that there were indians hoping to allarm\r\nhim in time to make his escape also; I still retained the charge in my\r\ngun which I was about to discharge at the moment the ball struck me.\r\nwhen I arrived in sight of the perogue I called the men to their arms\r\nto which they flew in an instant, I told them that I was wounded but I\r\nhoped not mortally, by an indian I beleived and directed them to follow\r\nme that I would return & give them battle and releive Cruzatte if\r\npossible who I feared had fallen into their hands; the men followed me\r\nas they were bid and I returned about a hundred paces when my wounds\r\nbecame so painfull and my thye so stiff that I could scarcely get on;\r\nin short I was compelled to halt and ordered the men to proceed and if\r\nthey found themselves overpowered by numbers to retreat in order\r\nkeeping up a fire. I now got back to the perogue as well as I could and\r\nprepared my self with a pistol my rifle and air-gun being determined as\r\na retreat was impracticable to sell my life as deerly as possible. in\r\nthis state of anxiety and suspense remained about 20 minutes when the\r\nparty returned with Cruzatte and reported that there were no indians\r\nnor the appearance of any; Cruzatte seemed much allarmed and declared\r\nif he had shot me it was not his intention, that he had shot an Elk in\r\nthe willows after he left or seperated from me. I asked him whether he\r\ndid not hear me when I called to him so frequently which he absolutely\r\ndenied. I do not beleive that the fellow did it intentionally but after\r\nfinding that he had shot me was anxious to conceal his knowledge of\r\nhaving done so. the ball had lodged in my breeches which I knew to be\r\nthe ball of the short rifles such as that he had, and there being no\r\nperson out with me but him and no indians that we could discover I have\r\nno doubt in my own mind of his having shot me. with the assistance of\r\nSergt. Gass I took off my cloaths and dressed my wounds myself as well\r\nas I could, introducing tents of patent lint into the ball holes, the\r\nwounds blead considerably but I was hapy to find that it had touched\r\nneither bone nor artery. I sent the men to dress the two Elk which\r\nCruzatte and myself had killed which they did in a few minutes and\r\nbrought the meat to the river. the small canoes came up shortly after\r\nwith the flesh of one Elk. my wounds being so situated that I could not\r\nwithout infinite pain make an observation I determined to relinquish it\r\nand proceeded on. we came within eight miles of our encampment of the\r\n15th of April 1805 and encamped on N. E. side. as it was painfull to me\r\nto be removed I slept on board the perogue; the pain I experienced\r\nexcited a high fever and I had a very uncomfortable night. at 4 P.M. we\r\npassed an encampment which had been evacuated this morning by Capt.\r\nClark, here I found a note from Capt. C. informing me that he had left\r\na letter for me at the entrance of the Yelow stone river, but that\r\nSergt. Pryor who had passed that place since he left it had taken the\r\nletter; that Sergt. Pryor having been robed of all his horses had\r\ndecended the Yelowstone river in skin canoes and had over taken him at\r\nthis encampment. this I fear puts an end to our prospects of obtaining\r\nthe Sioux Cheifs to accompany us as we have not now leasure to send and\r\nenjage Mr. Heney on this service, or at least he would not have time to\r\nengage them to go as early as it is absolutely necessary we should\r\ndecend the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lewis, August 12, 1806]\r\nThursday August 12th 1806.\r\nBeing anxious to overtake Capt. Clark who from the appearance of his\r\ncamps could be at no great distance before me, we set out early and\r\nproceeded with all possible expedition at 8 A.M. the bowsman informed\r\nme that there was a canoe and a camp he beleived of whitemen on the N.\r\nE. shore. I directed the perogue and canoes to come too at this place\r\nand found it to be the camp of two hunters from the Illinois by name\r\nJoseph Dickson and Forest Hancock. these men informed me that Capt. C.\r\nhad passed them about noon the day before. they also informed me that\r\nthey had left the Illinois in the summer 1804 since which time they had\r\nbeen ascended the Missouri, hunting and traping beaver; that they had\r\nbeen robed by the indians and the former wounded last winter by the\r\nTetons of the birnt woods; that they had hitherto been unsuccessfull in\r\ntheir voyage having as yet caught but little beaver, but were still\r\ndetermined to proceed. I gave them a short discription of the Missouri,\r\na list of distances to the most conspicuous streams and remarkable\r\nplaces on the river above and pointed out to them the places where the\r\nbeaver most abounded. I also gave them a file and a couple of pounds of\r\npowder with some lead. these were articles which they assured me they\r\nwere in great want of. I remained with these men an hour and a half\r\nwhen I took leave of them and proceeded. while I halted with these men\r\nColter and Collins who seperated from us on the 3rd ist. rejoined us.\r\nthey were well no accedent having happened. they informed me that after\r\nproceeding the first day and not overtaking us that they had concluded\r\nthat we were behind and had delayed several days in waiting for us and\r\nhad thus been unable to join us untill the present momet. my wounds\r\nfelt very stiff and soar this morning but gave me no considerable pain.\r\nthere was much less inflamation than I had reason to apprehend there\r\nwould be. I had last evening applyed a poltice of peruvian barks at 1\r\nP.M. I overtook Capt. Clark and party and had the pleasure of finding\r\nthem all well. as wrighting in my present situation is extreemly\r\npainfull to me I shall desist untill I recover and leave to my frind\r\nCapt. C. the continuation of our journal. however I must notice a\r\nsingular Cherry which is found on the Missouri in the bottom lands\r\nabout the beaverbends and some little distance below the white earth\r\nriver. this production is not very abundant even in the small tract of\r\ncountry to which it seems to be confined. the stem is compound erect\r\nand subdivided or branching without any regular order it rises to the\r\nhight of eight or ten feet seldom puting up more than one stem from the\r\nsame root not growing in cops as the Choke Cherry dose. the bark is\r\nsmooth and of a dark brown colour. the leaf is peteolate, oval accutely\r\npointed at it's apex, from one and a 1/4 to 11/2 inches in length and\r\nfrom 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in width, finely or minutely serrate, pale\r\ngreen and free from bubessence. the fruit is a globular berry about the\r\nsize of a buck-shot of a fine scarlet red; like the cherries cultivated\r\nin the U States each is supported by a seperate celindric flexable\r\nbranch peduncle which issue from the extremities of the boughs the\r\npeduncle of this cherry swells as it approahes the fruit being largest\r\nat the point of insertion. the pulp of this fruit is of an agreeable\r\nascid flavour and is now ripe. the style and stigma are permanent. I\r\nhave never seen it in blume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 3, 1806]\r\nThursday July 3rd 1806\r\nwe colected our horses and after brackfast I took My leave of Capt\r\nLewis and the indians and at 8 A M Set out with ____ men interpreter\r\nShabono & his wife & child (as an interpreter & interpretess for the\r\nCrow Inds and the latter for the Shoshoni) with 50 horses. we proceeded\r\non through the Vally of Clarks river on the West Side of the river\r\nnearly South 18 Miles and halted on the upper Side of a large Creek,\r\nhaveing Crossed 8 Streams 4 of which were Small. this vally is from 10\r\nto 15 Ms. in width tolerably leavel and partially timberd with long\r\nleaf & pitch pine, Some cotton wood, Birch, and Sweet willow on the\r\nborders of the Streams. I observed 2 Species of Clover in this vally\r\none the white Clover Common in the Western parts of the U. States, the\r\nother Species which is much Smaller than either the red or white both\r\nit's leaf & blossom the horses are excessively fond of this Species.\r\nafter letting our horses graze a Sufficient length of time to fill\r\nthemselves, and taking dinner of Venison we again resumed our journey\r\nup the Vally which we found more boutifully versified with Small open\r\nplains covered with a great variety of Sweet cented plants, flowers &\r\ngrass. this evening we Crossed 10 Streams 8 of which were large Creeks\r\nwhich comes roleing their Currents with Velocity into the river. those\r\nCreeks take their rise in the mountains to the West which mountains is\r\nat this time Covered with Snow for about 1/5 of the way from their tops\r\ndownwards. Some Snow is also to be Seen on the high points and hollows\r\nof the Mountains to the East of us. our Course this evening was nearly\r\nSouth 18 Ms. makeing a total of 36 miles today. we encamped on the N.\r\nSide of a large Creek where we found tolerable food for our horses.\r\nLabeish killed a Deer this evening. We Saw great numbers of deer and 1\r\nbear today. I also observed the burring Squirel of the Species Common\r\nabout the quawmarsh flatts West of the Rocky Mountains. Musquetors very\r\ntroublesom.--one man Jo. Potts very unwell this evening owing to\r\nrideing a hard trotting horse; I give him a pill of Opiom which Soon\r\nreleve him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 4, 1806]\r\nFriday July 4th 1806\r\nI order three hunters to Set out early this morning to hunt & kill Some\r\nmeat and by 7 A.M. we Collected our horses took braekfast and Set out\r\nproceeded on up the Vally on the West Side of Clarks river crossing\r\nthree large deep and rapid Creeks, and two of a Smaller Size to a Small\r\nbranch in the Spurs of the mountain and dined. the last Creek or river\r\nwhich we pass'd was So deep and the water So rapid that Several of the\r\nhorses were Sweped down Some distance and the Water run over Several\r\nothers which wet Several articles. after Crossing this little river, I\r\nobserved in the road the tracks of two men whome I prosume is of the\r\nShoshone nation. our hunters joined us with 2 deer in tolerable order.\r\non the Side of the Hill near the place we dined Saw a gange of Ibex or\r\nbig horn Animals I Shot at them running and missed. This being the day\r\nof the decleration of Independence of the United States and a Day\r\ncommonly Scelebrated by my Country I had every disposition to Selebrate\r\nthis day and therefore halted early and partook of a Sumptious Dinner\r\nof a fat Saddle of Venison and Mush of Cows (roots) after Dinner we\r\nproceeded on about one mile to a very large Creek which we assended\r\nSome distance to find a foard to cross in crossing this creek Several\r\narticles got wet, the water was So Strong, alto the debth was not much\r\nabove the horses belly, the water passed over the backs and loads of\r\nthe horses. those Creeks are emensely rapid has great decnt the bottoms\r\nof the Creek as well as the low lands on each Side is thickly covered\r\nwith large Stone after passing this Creek I inclined to the left and\r\nfell into the road on which we had passed down last fall near the place\r\nwe had dined on the 7th of Sept. and continued on the road passing up\r\non the W. Side of Clarks river 13 miles to the West fork of Sd. river\r\nand Encamped on an arm of the same I Sent out 2 men to hunt, and 3 in\r\nSerch of a foard to pass the river. at dark they all returned and\r\nreported that they had found a place that the river might be passed but\r\nwith Some risque of the loads getting wet I order them to get up their\r\nhorses and accompany me to those places &c. our hunters killed 4 deer\r\nto day. we made 30 ms. to day on a course nearly South Vally from 8 to\r\n10 mes. wide. contains a good portion of Pitch pine. we passed three\r\nlarge deep rapid Creeks this after noon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 5, 1806]\r\nSaturday July 5th 1806\r\nI rose at day light this morning despatched Labeash after a Buck which\r\nhe killed late last evening; and I with the three men who I had Sent in\r\nSerch of a ford across the West fork of Clarks river, and examined each\r\nford neither of them I thought would answer to pass the fork without\r\nwetting all the loads. near one of those places pointed out by Colter I\r\nfound a practiable foard and returned to Camp, ordered everything\r\npacked up and after Brackfast we Set out passed 5 Chanels of the river\r\nwhich is divided by Small Islands in passing the 6th & last Chanel\r\nColter horse Swam and with Some dificuelty he made the Opposite Shore,\r\nShannon took a different derection from Colter rained his horse up the\r\nStream and passed over very well I derected all to follow Shannon and\r\npass quartering up the river which they done and passed over tolerably\r\nwell the water running over the back of the 2 Smaller horses only.\r\nunfortunately my trunk & portmantue Containing Sea otter Skins flags\r\nSome curiosites & necessary articles in them got wet, also an esortment\r\nof Medicine, and my roots. about 1 mile we struk the East fork which\r\nhad fallen and was not higher than when we passed it last fall we had\r\nnot proceeded up this fork more than 1 mile eer we struck the road by\r\nwhich we passed down last fall and kept it at one mile we crossed the\r\nriver at a very good foard and continued up on the East Side to the\r\nfoot of the Mountain nearly opposite flour Crek & halted to let our\r\nhorses graze and dry our wet articles. I saw fresh Sign of 2 horses and\r\na fire burning on the side of the road. I prosume that those indians\r\nare spies from the Shoshones. Shannon & Crusat killed each a deer this\r\nmorning and J. Shields killed a female Ibex or bighorn on the side of\r\nthe Mountain, this Animal was very meager. Shannon left his tomahawk at\r\nthe place he killed his deer. I derect him to return for it and join me\r\nin the Vally on the East Side of this mountain. gave Shields permission\r\nto proceed on over to the 1st Vally and there hunt untill my arival\r\nthis evening at that place, after drying every article which detained\r\nus untill 1/2 past 4 P.M. we packed up and Crossed the Mountain into\r\nthe vally where we first met with the flatheads here I overtook Shields\r\nhe had not killed any thing. I crossed the river which heads in a high\r\npeecked mountain Covered with Snow N. E. of the Vally at about 20\r\nMiles. Shields informed me that the Flat head indians passed up the\r\nSmall Creek which we came down last fall about 2 miles above our\r\nEncampment of the 4th & 5th of, Septr. I proceeded up this South branch\r\n2 Miles and encamped on the E. side of the Creek, and Sent out several\r\nmen to examine the road. Shields returned at dark and informed me that\r\nthe best road turned up the hill from the creek 3 Miles higher up, and\r\nappeared to be a plain beaten parth. as this rout of the Oat lash\r\nshoots can be followed it will evidently Shorten our rout at least 2\r\ndays and as the indians informed me last fall a much better rout than\r\nthe one we came out. at all events I am deturmined to make the attempt\r\nand follow their trail if possible if I can prosue it my rout will be\r\nnearer and much better than the one we Came from the Shoshones, & if I\r\nshould not be able to follow their road; our rout can't possibly be\r\nmuch wors. The hunters killed two deer this evening. The after part of\r\nthe day we only come 8 miles makeing a total of 20 Miles-. Shannon Came\r\nup about Sunset haveing found his tomahawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 6, 1806]\r\nSunday 6th July 1806\r\nSome frost this morning the last night was so cold that I could not\r\nSleep. we Collected our horses which were much scattered which detained\r\nus untill 9 A.M. at which time we Set out and proceeded up the Creek on\r\nwhich we camped 3 Miles and left the road which we came on last fall to\r\nour right and assended a ridge with a gentle Slope to the dividing\r\nmountain which Seperates the waters from the Middle fork of Clarks\r\nriver from those and Lewis's river and passed over prosueing the rout\r\nof the Oat lash shute band which we met last fall to the head of a\r\nbranch of Wisdom R and down the Said branch crossing it frequently on\r\neach Side of this handsom glades in which I observe great quantities of\r\nquawmash just beginning to blume on each side of those glades the\r\ntimber is small and a great propotion of it Killed by the fires. I\r\nobserve the appearance of old buffalow roads and some heads on this\r\npart of the mountain. The Snow appears to lying in considerable masses\r\non the mountain from which we decended on the 4th of Septr. last. I\r\nobserve great numbers of the whistleing Squirel which burrows their\r\nholes Scattered on each Side of the glades through which we passed.\r\nShields killed a hare of the large mountain Species. the after part of\r\nthe day we passed on the hill Side N of the Creek for 6 Ms. Creek and\r\nentered an extensive open Leavel plain in which the Indian trail\r\nScattered in Such a manner that we Could not pursue it. the Indian\r\nwoman wife to Shabono informed me that she had been in this plain\r\nfrequently and knew it well that the Creek which we decended was a\r\nbranch of Wisdom river and when we assended the higher part of the\r\nplain we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction to the\r\nCanoes, and when we arived at that gap we would See a high point of a\r\nmountain covered with snow in our direction to the canoes. we proceeded\r\non 1 mile and Crossd. a large Creek from the right which heads in a\r\nSnow Mountain and Fish Creek over which there was a road thro a gap. we\r\nassended a Small rise and beheld an open boutifull Leavel Vally or\r\nplain of about 20 Miles wide and near 60 long extending N & S. in every\r\ndirection around which I could see high points of Mountains Covered\r\nwith Snow. I discovered one at a distance very high covered with Snow\r\nwhich bore S. 80° E. The Squar pointed to the gap through which she said\r\nwe must pass which was S. 56° E. She said we would pass the river before\r\nwe reached the gap. we had not proceeded more than 2 Miles in the last\r\nCreek, before a violent Storm of wind accompand. with hard rain from\r\nthe S W. imediately from off the Snow Mountains this rain was Cold and\r\nlasted 11/2 hours. I discovd. the rain wind as it approached and halted\r\nand formd. a solid column to protect our Selves from the Violency of\r\nthe gust. after it was over I proceeded on about 5 Miles to Some Small\r\ndry timber on a Small Creek and encampd. made large fires and dryed our\r\nSelves. here I observed Some fresh Indian Signs where they had been\r\ngathering quawmash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 7, 1806]\r\nMonday 7th July 1806\r\nThis morning our horses were very much Scattered; I Sent out men in\r\nevery direction in Serch of them. they brought all except 9 by 6 oClock\r\nand informed me that they could not find those 9. I then ordered 6 men\r\nto take horses and go different directions and at a greater distance\r\nthose men all returned by 10 A.M. and informed me that they had circles\r\nin every direction to 6 or 8 miles around Camp and could not See any\r\nSigns of them, that they had reasons to believe that the indians had\r\nStolen them in the course of the night, and founded their reasons on\r\nthe quallity of the horses, all being the most valuable horses we had,\r\nand Several of them so attached to horses of inferior quallity which we\r\nhave they could not be Seperated from each other when driveing with\r\ntheir loads on in the course of the day. I thought it probable that\r\nthey might be stolen by Some Skulking Shoshones, but as it was yet\r\npossible that they may have taken our back rout or rambled to a greater\r\ndistance I deturmined to leave a Small party and hunt for them to day,\r\nand proceed on with the main party and all the baggage to the Canoes,\r\nraise them out of the water and expose them to the sun to dry by the\r\ntime this party Should overtake me. I left Sergt. Ordway, Shannon,\r\nGibson Collins & Labeech with directions to hunt this day for the\r\nhorses without they Should discover that the Inds. had taken them into\r\nthe Mountains, and prosue our trail &c. at 1/2 past 10 A M I set out\r\nand proceeded on through an open rich vally crossing four large Creeks\r\nwith extensive low and mirey bottoms, and a Small river keeping the\r\nCourse I had set out on S. 56° E after crossing the river I kept up on\r\nthe N E. side, Sometimes following an old road which frequently\r\ndisappeared, at the distance of 16 miles we arived at a Boiling Spring\r\nSituated about 100 paces from a large Easterly fork of the Small river\r\nin a leavel open vally plain and nearly opposit & E. of the 3 forks of\r\nthis little river which heads in the Snowey Mountains to the S E. & S W\r\nof the Springs. this Spring contains a very considerable quantity of\r\nwater, and actually blubbers with heat for 20 paces below where it\r\nrises. it has every appearance of boiling, too hot for a man to endure\r\nhis hand in it 3 seconds. I directt Sergt. Pryor and John Shields to\r\nput each a peice of meat in the water of different Sises. the one about\r\nthe Size of my 3 fingers Cooked dun in 25 minits the other much thicker\r\nwas 32 minits before it became Sufficiently dun. this water boils up\r\nthrough some loose hard gritty Stone. a little sulferish after takeing\r\ndininer and letting our horses graize 1 hour and a half we proceeded on\r\nCrossed this easterly branch and up on the N. Side of this middle fork\r\n9 miles crossed it near the head of an Easterly branch and passed\r\nthrough a gap of a mountain on the Easterly Side of which we encamped\r\nnear some butifull which fall into Willards Creek. I directed that the\r\nrambling horses should be hobbled, and the Sentinal to examine the\r\nhorses after the moon rose. Emence beaver sign.\r\n\r\nThis extensive vally Surround with covered with snow is extreemly\r\nfertile covered esculent plants &c and the Creeks which pass through it\r\ncontains emence numbers of beaver &c. I now take my leave of this\r\nbutifull extensive vally which I call the hot spring Vally, and behold\r\none less extensive and much more rugid on Willards Creek for near 12\r\nmiles in length. remarkable Cold night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 8, 1806]\r\nTuesday July 8th 1806\r\nOur horses being Scattered we were detained unill 8 A. M before we Set\r\nout. we proceeded on down Willards Creek on the S.W. Side about 11\r\nmiles near which the Creek passes through the mountain we then Steared\r\nS. 20° E. to the West branch of Jeffersons river in Snake Indian cove\r\nabout 7 miles and halded two hours to let the horses graize. after\r\ndinner we proceeded on down the forke which is here but Small 9 Miles\r\nto our encampment of 17 Augt. at which place we Sunk our Canoes &\r\nburied Some articles, as before mentioned the most of the Party with me\r\nbeing Chewers of Tobacco become So impatient to be chewing it that they\r\nScercely gave themselves time to take their Saddles off their horses\r\nbefore they were off to the deposit. I found every article Safe, except\r\na little damp. I gave to each man who used tobacco about two feet off a\r\npart of a role took one third of the ballance myself and put up 2/3 in\r\na box to Send down with the most of the articles which had been left at\r\nthis place, by the Canoes to Capt. Lewis. as it was late nothing Could\r\nbe done with the Canoes this evening. I examined them and found then\r\nall Safe except one of the largest which had a large hole in one Side &\r\nSplit in bow. The Country through which we passed to day was\r\ndiversified high dry and uneaven Stoney open plains and low bottoms\r\nvery boggy with high mountains on the tops and North sides of which\r\nthere was Snow, great quantities of the Species of hysoop & shrubs\r\ncommon to the Missouri plains are Scattered in those Vallys and hill\r\nSides. The road which we have traveled from travellers rest Creek to\r\nthis place an excellent road. and with only a few trees being cut out\r\nof the way would be an excellent waggon road one Mountain of about 4\r\nmiles over excepted which would require a little digging The distance\r\nis 164 Miles-. Shields killed an antelope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 9, 1806]\r\nWednesday 9th July 1806\r\nrose early had the horses brought up. after which I had the Canoes\r\nraised washed, brough down and drawn up on Shore to dry and repard. Set\r\nSeveral men to work digging for the Tobacco Capt. Lewis informed me he\r\nhad buried in the place the lodge Stood when we lay here last Summer,\r\nthey Serched diligently without finding anything. at 10 A M Sergt.\r\nOrdway and party arrived with the horses we had lost. he reported that\r\nhe found those horses near the head of the Creek on which we encamped,\r\nmakeing off as fast as they could and much Scattered. nothing material\r\ntook place with his party in their absence. I had the Canoes repared\r\nmen & lodes appotioned ready to embark tomorrow morning. I also formd.\r\nthe party to accomp me to the river Rejhone from applicants and\r\napportioned what little baggage I intended to carry as also the Spear\r\nhorses. this day was windy and Cold. The Squar brought me a Plant the\r\nroot of which the nativs eat. this root most resembles a Carrot in form\r\nand Size and Something of its colour, being of a pailer yellow than\r\nthat of our Carrot, the Stem and leaf is much like the Common Carrot,\r\nand the taste not unlike. it is a native of moist land.--John Sheilds\r\nand Collins each killed a Deer this morning. the wind dried our Canoes\r\nvery much they will be Sufficiently dry by tomorrow morning to Set out\r\nin them down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 10, 1806]\r\nThursday July 10th 1806\r\nlast night was very cold and this morning everything was white with\r\nfrost and the grass Stiff frozend. I had Some water exposed in a bason\r\nin which the ice was 3/4 of an inch thick this morning. I had all the\r\nCanoes put into the water and every article which was intended to be\r\nSent down put on board, and the horses collected and packed with what\r\nfiew articles I intend takeing with me to the River Rochejhone, and\r\nafter brackfast we all Set out at the Same time & proceeded on Down\r\nJeffersons river on the East Side through Sarviss Vally and rattle\r\nsnake mountain and into that butifull and extensive Vally open and\r\nfertile which we Call the beaver head Vally which is the Indian name in\r\ntheir language Har na Hap pap Chah. from the No. of those animals in it\r\n& a pt. of land resembling the head of one this Vally extends from the\r\nrattle Snake Mountain down Jeffersons river as low as fraziers Creek\r\nabove the big horn mountain and is from 12 to 30 miles in width and\r\n____ miles on a direct line in length and Jeffersons river in passing\r\nthrough this Vally reives McNeals Creek, Track Creek, Phalanthrophy\r\nriver, Wisdom river, Fields river and Fraziers Creek each throw in a\r\nconsiderable quantity of water and have innoumerable beaver and otter\r\non them; the bushes in their low bottoms are the resort for great\r\nnumbers of Deer, and in the higher parts of the Vally we see Antelopes\r\nscattered feeding. I saw also on the Sides of the rock in rattle snake\r\nmountain 15 big horn animals, those animals feed on the grass which\r\ngrow on the Sides of the mountn. and in the narrow bottoms on the Water\r\ncourses near the Steep Sides of the mountains on which they can make\r\ntheir escape from the pursute of wolves Bear &c. at Meridian I halted\r\nto let the horses Graze having Come 15 Miles I ordered the to land.\r\nSergt. Ordway informed me that the party with him had Come on very\r\nwell, and he thought the Canoes could go as farst as the horses &c. as\r\nthe river now become wider and not So Sholl, I deturmined to put all\r\nthe baggage &c. which I intend takeing with me to the river Rochejhone\r\nin the canoes and proceed on down with them myself to the 3 forks or\r\nMadisons & galletens rivers. leaveing the horses to be taken down by\r\nSergt. Pryor and 6 of the men of the party to accompany me to the river\r\nRochejhone and directed Sergt. Pryor to proceed on moderately and if\r\npossible encamp with us every night. after dinner had my baggage put on\r\nboard and Set out, and proceeded on tolerable well to the head of the\r\n3000 Mile Island on which we had encamped on the 11th of Augt last. the\r\nCanoes passed Six of my encampments assending, opposit this island I\r\nencamped on the East side. the Musquetors were troublesom all day and\r\nuntill one hour after Sunset when it became Cool and they disappeared.\r\nin passing down in the Course of this day we saw great numbers of\r\nbeaver lying on the Shores in the Sun. wild young Gees and ducks are\r\ncommon in this river. we killed two young gees this evening. I saw\r\nseveral large rattle Snakes in passing the rattle Snake Mountain they\r\nwere fierce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 11, 1806]\r\nFriday 11th July 1806\r\nSent on 4 of the best hunters in 2 Canoes to proceed on a fiew miles a\r\nhead and hunt untill I came up with them, after an early brackfast I\r\nproceeded on down a very crooked Chanel, at 8 a. m I overtook one Canoe\r\nwith a Deer which Collins had killed, at meridian passed Sergt. Pryors\r\nCamp near a high point of land on the left Side which the Shoshones\r\ncall the beavers head. the wind rose and blew with great violence from\r\nthe S W imediately off Some high mountains Covered with Snow. the\r\nviolence of this wind retarded our progress very much and the river\r\nbeing emencly Crooked we had it imediately in our face nearly every\r\nbend. at 6 P M I passed Phalanthrophy river which I proceved was very\r\nlow. the wind Shifted about to the N. E. and bley very hard tho much\r\nwormer than the forepart of the day. at 7 P M I arrived at the\r\nEnterance of Wisdom River and Encampd. in the Spot we had encamped the\r\n6th of August last. here we found a Bayonet which had been left & the\r\nCanoe quite safe. I directed that all the nails be taken out of this\r\nCanoe and paddles to be made of her Sides & here I came up with Gibson\r\n& Colter whome I had Sent on a head for the purpose of hunting this\r\nmorning, they had killed a fat Buck and 5 young gees nearly grown.\r\nWisdom river is very high and falling. I have Seen great Nos. of Beaver\r\non the banks and in the water as I passed down to day, also some Deer\r\nand great numbers young gees, Sand hill cranes &c. &c. Sgt. Pryor left\r\na deer on the shore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 12, 1806]\r\nSaturday 12th,July 1806\r\nSergt. Pryor did not join me last night he has proceeded on down. the\r\nbeaver was flacking in the river about us all the last night. this\r\nMorning I was detained untill 7 A M makeing Paddles and drawing the\r\nnails of the Canoe to be left at this place and the one we had before\r\nleft here. after completing the paddles &c and takeing Some Brackfast I\r\nset out the Current I find much Stronger below the forks than above and\r\nthe river tolerably streight as low as panther Creek when it became\r\nmuch more Crooked the Wind rose and blew hard off the Snowey mountains\r\nto the N. W. and renderd it very difficuelt to keep the canoes from\r\nrunning against the Shore at 2 P.M. the Canoe in which I was in was\r\ndriven by a Suden puff of wind under a log which projected over the\r\nwater from the bank, and the man in the Stern Howard was Caught in\r\nbetween the Canoe and the log and a little hurt after disingaging our\r\nselves from this log the canoe was driven imediately under a drift\r\nwhich projected over and a little abov the Water, here the Canoe was\r\nvery near turning over we with much exertion after takeing out Some of\r\nthe baggage hauled her out, and proceeded on without receving any\r\ndamage. the men in the other Canoes Seeing our Situation landed and\r\ncome with as much Speed as possible through the briers and thick brush\r\nto our assistance. but from the thickness of the brush did not get up\r\nto our assistance untill we had got Clear. at 3 P M we halted at the\r\nenterance of Fields Creek and dined here Willard and Collins over took\r\nus with two deer which they had killd. this morning and by takeing a\r\ndifferent Side of an Island from which we Came, we had passed them.\r\nafter dinner I proceeded on and Encamped a little below our encampmt.\r\nof the 31st of July last. the Musquetoes very troublesome this evening\r\nSome old buffalow Signs. I killed 4 young gees and Collins killed 2\r\nbever this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 13, 1806]\r\nSunday 13th July 1806\r\nSet out early this morning and proceded on very well to the enterance\r\nof Madicines river at our old Encampment of the 27th July last at 12\r\nwhere I found Sergt. Pryor and party with the horses, they had arived\r\nat this place one hour before us. his party had killed 6 deer & a white\r\nbear I had all the horses driven across Madicine & gallitines rivers\r\nand halted to dine and let the horses feed imediately below the\r\nenterance of Gallitine. had all the baggage of the land party taken out\r\nof the Canoes and after dinner the 6 Canoes and the party of 10 men\r\nunder the direction of Sergt. Ordway Set out. previous to their\r\ndepartur I gave instructions how they were to proceed &c. I also wrote\r\nto Capt Lewis by Sergt. Ordway-. my party now Consists of the following\r\npersons Viz: Serjeant N. Pryor, Jo. Shields, G. Shannon William\r\nBratton, Labiech, Windsor, H. Hall, Gibson, Interpreter Shabono his\r\nwife & Child and my man york; with 49 horses and a colt. the horses\r\nfeet are very sore and Several of them can Scercely proceed on. at 5.\r\nP. M I Set out from the head of Missouri at the 3 forks, and proceeded\r\non nearly East 4 miles and Encamped on the bank of Gallitines River\r\nwhich is a butifull navigable Stream. Saw a large Gange of Elk in the\r\nplains and Deer in the river bottoms. I also observe beaver and Several\r\notter in galletines river as I passed along. Gibson killed an otter the\r\nfur of which was much longer and whiter than any which I had Seen.\r\nWillard killed 2 deer this morning. all the meat I had put into the\r\nCanoes except a Sufficiency for Supper. The Country in the forks\r\nbetween Gallitins & Madisens rivers is a butifull leavel plain Covered\r\nwith low grass.--on the lower or N E. Side of Gallitins river the\r\nCountry rises gradually to the foot of a mountain which runs nearly\r\nparrelal. those plains are indefferant or the Soil of which is not very\r\nrich they are Stoney & Contain Several Stratas of white rock. the\r\nCurrent of the river is rapid and near the mouth contains Several\r\nislands, it is navigable for Canoes. I saw Several Antelope Common\r\nDeer, wolves, beaver, Otter, Eagles, hawks, Crows, wild gees both old\r\nand young, does &c. &c. I observe Several leading roads which appear to\r\npass to a gap of the mountain in a E. N E. direction about 18 or 20\r\nmiles distant. The indian woman who has been of great Service to me as\r\na pilot through this Country recommends a gap in the mountain more\r\nSouth which I shall cross.-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 14, 1806]\r\nMonday 14th July 1806\r\nSent Sheilds a head to kill a deer for our brackfast and at an early\r\nhour Set out with the party Crossed Gallitines river which makes a\r\nConsiderable bend to the N. E. and proceeded on nearly S. 78° E through\r\nan open Leavel plain at 6 miles I Struck the river and crossed a part\r\nof it and attemptd to proceed on through the river bottoms which was\r\nSeveral Miles wide at this place, I crossed Several chanels of the\r\nriver running through the bottom in defferent directions. I proceeded\r\non about two miles crossing those defferent chanels all of which was\r\ndamed with beaver in Such a manner as to render the passage\r\nimpracticable and after Swamped as I may Say in this bottom of beaver I\r\nwas compelled to turn Short about to the right and after Some\r\ndifficuelty made my way good to an open low but firm plain which was an\r\nIsland and extended nearly the Course I wished to proceed. here the\r\nSquar informed me that there was a large road passing through the upper\r\npart of this low plain from Madicins river through the gap which I was\r\nStearing my Course to. I proceeded up this plain 4 miles and Crossed\r\nthe main Chanel of the river, having passed through a Skirt of cotton\r\ntimber to an open low plain on the N E. Side of the river and nooned\r\nit. the river is divided and on all the small Streams inoumerable\r\nquantities of beaver dams, tho the river is yet navagable for Canoes. I\r\novertook Shields Soon after I set out; he had killed a large fat Buck.\r\nI saw Elk deer & Antelopes, and great deel of old Signs of buffalow.\r\ntheir roads is in every direction. The Indian woman informs me that a\r\nfiew years ago Buffalow was very plenty in those plains & Vallies quit\r\nas high as the head of Jeffersons river, but flew of them ever come\r\ninto those Vallys of late years owing to the Shoshones who are fearfull\r\nof passing into the plains West of the mountains and Subsist on what\r\ngame they Can Catch in the Mountains principally and the fish which\r\nthey take in the E. fork of Lewis's river. Small parties of the\r\nShoshones do pass over to the plains for a few days at a time and kill\r\nbuffalow for their Skins and dried meat, and return imediately into the\r\nMountains. after Dinner we proceeded on a little to the South of East\r\nthrough an open leavel plain to the three forks of the E branch of\r\nGallitines River at about 12 miles, crossed the most Southerly of those\r\nforks and Struck an old buffalow road which I kept Continuing nearly\r\nthe Same Course up the middle fork Crossed it and Camped on a small\r\nbranch of the middle fork on the N E. Side at the commencement of the\r\ngap of the mountain--the road leading up this branch, Several other\r\nroads all old Come in from the right & left. emence quantities of\r\nbeaver on this Fork quit down, and their dams very much impeed the\r\nnavigation of it from the 3 forks down, tho I beleive it practicable\r\nfor Small Canoes by unloading at a fiew of the worst of those dams.\r\nDeer are plenty. Shannon Shields and Sergt. Pryor each killed one which\r\nwere very fat much more So than they are Commonly at this Season of the\r\nyear. The Main fork of Galletins River turn South and enter them\r\nmountains which are yet Covered with Snow. Madisens river makes a Great\r\nbend to the East and enters the Same mountain. a leavel plain between\r\nthe two rivers below the mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 15, 1806]\r\nTuesday 15th July 1806\r\nwe collected our horses and after an early brackft at 8 A M Set out and\r\nproceeded up the branch to the head thence over a low gap in the\r\nmountain thence across the heads of the N E. branch of the fork of\r\nGallitins river which we Camped near last night passing over a low\r\ndividing ridge to the head of a water Course which runs into the\r\nRochejhone, prosueing an old buffalow road which enlargenes by one\r\nwhich joins it from the most Easterly branch of the East fork of\r\nGaletins R. proceeding down the branch a little to the N. of East\r\nkeeping on the North Side of the branch to the River rochejhone at\r\nwhich place I arrived at 2 P M. The Distance from the three forks of\r\nthe Easterly fork of Galletines river (from whence it may be navigated\r\ndown with Small Canoes) to the river Rochejhone is 18 miles on an\r\nexcellent high dry firm road with very incoiderable hills. from this\r\nriver to the nearest part of the main fork of Gallitine is 29 miles\r\nmostly through a leavel plain. from the head of the Missouri at the 3\r\nforks 48 miles through a leavel plain the most of the way as may be\r\nseen by the remarks in the evening after the usial delay of 3 hours to\r\ngive the horses time to feed and rest and allowing our Selves time also\r\nto Cook and eate Dinner, I proceeded on down the river on an old\r\nbuffalow road at the distance of 9 miles below the mountains Shield\r\nRiver discharges itself into the Rochejhone on it's N W. side above a\r\nhigh rocky Clift, this river is 35 yards wide deep and affords a great\r\nquantity of water it heads in those Snowey Mountains to the N W with\r\nHowards Creek, it contains some Timber Such as Cotton & willow in it's\r\nbottoms, and Great numbers of beaver the river also abounds in those\r\nanimals as far as I have Seen.\r\n\r\npassed the creek and over a high rocky hill and encamped in the upper\r\npart of a large bottom. The horses feet are very sore many of them Can\r\nScercely proceed on over the Stone and gravel in every other respect\r\nthey are Sound and in good Sperits. I saw two black bear on the side of\r\nthe mountains this morning. Several gangs of Elk from 100 to 200 in a\r\ngangue on the river, great numbers of Antelopes. one Elk only killed to\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Roche passes out of a high rugid mountain covered with Snow. the\r\nbottoms are narrow within the mountains but widen from 1/2 a m. to 2\r\nms. in the Vally below, those bottoms are Subject to over flow, they\r\ncontain Some tall Cotton wood, and willow rose bushes & rushes Honey\r\nsuckle &c. a Second bottom on the N E. Side which rises to about 20\r\nfeet higher the first & is 1 m. wide this bottom is coars gravel pebils\r\n& Sand with Some earth on which the grass grow very Short and at this\r\ntime is quit dry this 2d bottom over flows in high floods on the\r\nopposit Side of the river the plain is much higher and extendes quite\r\nto the foot of the mountain. The mountains to the S. S. E on the East\r\nside of the river is rocky rugid and on them are great quantities of\r\nSnow. a bold Snow mountain which bears East & is imediately at & N W of\r\nthe 3 forks of the East fork of Gallitins river may be Seen, there is\r\nalso a high rugid Mtn. on which is Snow bearing North 15 or 20 miles.\r\nbut fiew flowers to be Seen in those plains. low grass in the high\r\nplains, and the Common corse grass, rushes and a species of rye is the\r\ngrowth of the low bottoms. the mountains have Some scattering pine on\r\nthem, and on the Spurs and hill Sides there is some scrubby pine. I can\r\nSee no timber Sufficient large for a Canoe which will Carry more than 3\r\nmen and Such a one would be too Small to answer my purpose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 16, 1806]\r\nWednesday 16th July 1806\r\nI gave Labeech promission to proceed on early this morning a head and\r\nkill a fat Elk or Buffalow. our horses haveing rambled to a long\r\ndistance down the river detained us much later than Common. we did not\r\nSet out untill 9 A M. we had not proceeded on far before I saw a\r\nbuffalow & Sent Shannon to kill it this buffalow provd. to be a very\r\nfat Bull I had most of the flesh brought on an a part of the Skin to\r\nmake mockersons for Some of our lame horses. proceeded on down the\r\nriver without finding any trees Sufficently large for a Canoe about 10\r\nmiles and halted having passed over to an Island on which there was\r\ngood food for our horses to let them graze & Dine. I have not Seen\r\nLabeech as yet. Saw a large gangue of about 200 Elk and nearly as many\r\nAntilope also two white or Grey Bear in the plains, one of them I\r\nChased on horse back about 2 miles to the rugid part of the plain where\r\nI was compelled to give up the Chase two of the horses was So lame\r\nowing to their feet being worn quit Smooth and to the quick, the hind\r\nfeet was much the worst I had Mockersons made of green Buffalow Skin\r\nand put on their feet which Seams to releve them very much in passing\r\nover the Stoney plains. after dinner I proceeded on Soon after I had\r\nset Out Labeech joined us with part of a fat Elk which he had killed. I\r\npassed over a Stoney point at which place the river runs Close to the\r\nhigh land on the N W. side crossed a small Creek and Encamped on the\r\nriver a little below its Enterance. Saw emence heards of Elk feeding on\r\nthe opposit side of the river. I saw a great number of young gees in\r\nthe river. one of the men brought me a fish of a species I am\r\nunacquainted; it was 8 inches long formed like a trout. it's mouth was\r\nplaced like that of the Sturgeon a red streak passed down each Side\r\nfrom the gills to the tail. The rocks which the high lands are faced\r\nwith and which may also be seen in perpendicular Straters in the high\r\nplains, is a dark freestone. the greater part of this rock is of an\r\nexcellent grit for Grindstones hard and sharp. observe the Silkgrass\r\nSunflower & Wild indigo all in blume. but fiew other flowers are to be\r\nSeen in those plains. The river and Creek bottoms abound in Cotton wood\r\ntrees, tho none of them Sufficiently large for Canoes. and the current\r\nof the Rochejhone is too rapid to depend on Skinn canoes. no other\r\nalternetive for me but to proceed on down untill I can find a tree\r\nSufficently large &c. to make a Canoe.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 17, 1806]\r\nThursday 17th July 1806\r\nThe rain of last night wet us all. I had the horses all Collected early\r\nand Set out, proceeded ove the point of a ridge and through an open low\r\nbottom crossed a large Creek which heads in a high Snow toped Mountain\r\nto the N W. imediately opposit to the enterance of the Creek one\r\nSomething larger falls in from the high Snow mountains to the S W. &\r\nSouth those Creeks I call Rivers across they contain Some timber in\r\ntheir Vallys at the distance of ____ Miles by water we arive at the\r\nenterance of two Small rivers or large Creeks which fall in nearly\r\nopposit to each other the one on the N E side is 30 yards wide. I call\r\nit Otter River the other Beaver R below the enterance of this Creek I\r\nhalted as usial to let the Horses graze &c. I saw a Single Pelicon\r\nwhich is the first which I have Seen on this river. after Dinner I\r\nproceeded on Down the Rochejhone passing over a low ridge through a\r\nSmall bottom and on the Side of a Stoney hill for 2 miles and through a\r\nSmall bottom and again on the Side of a high hill for 11/2 M. to a\r\nbottom in which we Incamped opposit a Small Island. The high lands\r\napproach the river on either side much nearer than it does above and\r\ntheir Sides are partially covered with low pine & Cedar, none of which\r\nare Sufficently large for Canoes, nor have I Seen a Cotton tree in the\r\nlow bottoms Sufficently large for that purpose. Buffalow is getting\r\nmuch more plenty than they were above. not so many Elk & more deer\r\nShannon killed one deer. I Saw in one of those Small bottoms which I\r\npassed this evening an Indian fort which appears to have been built\r\nlast Summer. this fort was built of logs and bark. the logs was put up\r\nvery Closely capping on each other about 5 feet and Closely chinked.\r\naround which bark was Set up on end so as to Cover the Logs. the\r\nenterance was also guarded by a work on each Side of it and faceing the\r\nriver. this work is about 50 feet Diameter & nearly round. the Squaw\r\ninforms me that when the war parties find themselves pursued they make\r\nthose forts to defend themselves in from the pursuers whose Superior\r\nnumbers might other wise over power them and cut them off without\r\nreceiveing much injurey on hors back &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 18, 1806]\r\nFriday 18th July 1806\r\nas we were about Setting out this morning two Buffalow Bulls came near\r\nour Camp Several of the men Shot at one of them. their being near the\r\nriver plunged in and Swam across to the opposit Side and there died.\r\nShabono was thrown from his horse to day in pursute of a Buffaloe, the\r\nhose unfortunately Steping into a Braroe hole fell and threw him over\r\nhis head. he is a good deel brused on his hip Sholder & face. after\r\nbrackfast I proceeded on as usial, passd. over points of ridges So as\r\nto cutoff bends of the river crossed a Small Muddy brook on which I\r\nfound great quantities of the Purple, yellow & black currents ripe.\r\nthey were of an excellent flavour. I think the purple Superior to any I\r\nhave ever tasted. The river here is about 200 yards wide rapid as usial\r\nand the water gliding over corse gravel and round Stones of various\r\nsizes of an excellent grite for whetestones. the bottoms of the river\r\nare narrow. the hills are not exceeding 200 feet in hight the sides of\r\nthem are generally rocky and composed of rocks of the same texture of a\r\ndark Colour of Grit well Calculated for grindstones &c. The high\r\nbottoms is composed of gravel and Stone like those in the Chanel of the\r\nriver, with a mixture of earth of a dark brown colour The Country back\r\nfrom the river on each Side is generally open wavering plains. Some\r\npine is to be Seen in every direction in those plains on the Sides of\r\nhills &c. at 11 A.M. I observed a Smoke rise to the S. S. E in the\r\nplains towards the termonation of the rocky mountains in that direction\r\n(which is Covered with Snow) this Smoke must be raisd. by the Crow\r\nIndians in that direction as a Signal for us, or other bands. I think\r\nit most probable that they have discovered our trail and takeing us to\r\nbe Shoshone &c. in Serch of them the Crow Indians to trade as is their\r\nCustom, have made this Smoke to Shew where they are-or otherwise\r\ntakeing us to be their Enemy made this Signal for other bands to be on\r\ntheir guard. I halted in a bottom of fine grass to let the horses graze.\r\n\r\nShields killed a fat Buck on which we all Dined. after dinner and a\r\ndelay of 3 hours to allow the horses time to feed, we Set out at 4 P.M.\r\nI set out and proceeded down the river through a butifull bottom,\r\npassing a Indian fort on the head of a Small island near the Lard Shore\r\nand Encamped on a Small Island Seperated from the Lard Shore by a very\r\nnarrow Chanel. Shields killed a Buffalow this evening which Caused me\r\nto halt sooner than Common to Save Some of the flesh which was So rank\r\nand Strong that we took but very little. Gibson in attempting to mount\r\nhis horse after Shooting a deer this evening fell and on a Snag and\r\nsent it nearly two inches into the Muskeler part of his thy. he informs\r\nme this Snag was about 1 inch in diamuter burnt at the end. this is a\r\nvery bad wound and pains him exceedingly. I dressed the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 19, 1806]\r\nSaturday 19th July 1806.\r\nI rose early and dressed Gibsons wound. he Slept but very little last\r\nnight and complains of great pain in his Knee and hip as well as his\r\nthy. there being no timber on this part of the Rochjhone sufficintly\r\nlarge for a Canoe and time is pracious as it is our wish to get to the\r\nU States this Season, conclude to take Gibson in a litter if he is not\r\nable to ride on down the river untill I can find a tree Sufficently\r\nlarge for my purpose. I had the Strongest and jentlesst Horse Saddled\r\nand placed Skins & blankets in Such a manner that when he was put on\r\nthe horse he felt himself in as easy a position as when lying. this was\r\na fortunate circunstance as he Could go much more at his ease than in a\r\nlitter. passed Rose bud river on Sd Side I proceeded on about 9 miles,\r\nand halted to let the horses graze and let Gibson rest. his leg become\r\nSo numed from remaining in one position, as to render extreemly\r\npainfull to him. I derected Shields to keep through the thick timber\r\nand examine for a tree sufficently large & Sound to make a Canoe, and\r\nalso hunt for Some Wild Ginger for a Poltice for Gibsons wound. he\r\njoined me at dinner with 2 fat Bucks but found neither tree or Ginger.\r\nhe informed me that 2 white bear Chased him on horsback, each of which\r\nhe Shot from his horse &c. Currents are ripe and abundant, i, e, the\r\nYellow, black & purple spcies. we passed over two high points of Land\r\nfrom which I had a View of the rocky Mounts. to the W. & S. S. E. all\r\nCovered with Snow. I also Saw a low mountain in an Easterly direction.\r\nthe high lands is partially Covered with pine and form purpendcular\r\nClifts on either side. afer dinner I proceeded on the high lands become\r\nlower on either Side and those of the Stard Side form Bluffs of a\r\ndarkish yellow earth; the bottom widens to Several Ms. on the Stard\r\nSide. the timber which cotton wood principally Scattered on the borders\r\nof the river is larger than above. I have Seen Some trees which would\r\nmake very Small Canoes. Gibsons thy became So painfull that he could\r\nnot Set on the horse after rideing about 2 hours and a half I directed\r\nSergt Pryor and one man to continue with him under the Shade of a tree\r\nfor an hour and then proceed on to the place I Should encamp which\r\nwould be in the first good timber for canoes for the below. It may be\r\nproper to observe that the emence Sworms of Grass hoppers have\r\ndistroyed every Sprig of Grass for maney miles on this Side of the\r\nriver, and appear to be progressing upwards. about 4 Miles below the\r\nplace I left Sergt. Pryor with Gibson found some large timber near\r\nwhich the grass was tolerably good I Encamped under a thick grove of\r\nthose trees which was not Sufficiently large for my purpose, tho two of\r\nthem would mak small Canoes. I took Shields and proceeded on through a\r\nlarge timbered bottom imediately below in Serch of better trees for\r\nCanoes, found Several about the Same Size with those at my Camp. at\r\ndark I returned to Camp\r\n\r\nSergt. Pryor had arived with gibson. after my arival at this place the\r\nhunters killed Seven Elk, four Deer, and I wounded a Buffalow very\r\nbadly near the Camp imediately after I arived. in the forepart of the\r\nday the hunters killed two deer an Antelope & Shot two Bear. Shabono\r\ninformed me that he Saw an Indian on the high lands on the opposit Side\r\nof the river, in the time I was absent in the woods. I saw a Smoke in\r\nthe Same direction with that which I had Seen on the 7th inst. it\r\nappeared to be in the Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 20, 1806]\r\nSunday 20th July 1806\r\nI directed Sergt. Pryor and Shields each of them good judges of timber\r\nto proceed on down the river Six or 8 miles and examine the bottoms if\r\nany larger trees than those near which we are encamped can be found and\r\nreturn before twelve oClock. they Set out at daylight. I also Sent\r\nLabech Shabono & hall to Skin & some of the flesh of the Elk Labeech\r\nhad killed last evening they returned with one Skin the wolves haveing\r\neaten the most of the other four Elk. I also Sent two men in Serch of\r\nwood Soutable for ax handles. they found some choke cherry which is the\r\nbest wood which Can be precured in this Country. Saw a Bear on an\r\nIsland opposit and Several Elk. Sergt. Pryor and Shields returned at\r\nhalf past 11 A M. and informed me that they had proceeded down the\r\ntimbered bottoms of the river for about 12 miles without finding a tree\r\nbetter than those near my Camp. I deturmined to have two Canoes made\r\nout of the largest of those trees and lash them together which will\r\nCause them to be Study and fully Sufficient to take my Small party &\r\nSelf with what little baggage we have down this river. had handles put\r\nin the 3 Axes and after Sharpening them with a file fell the two trees\r\nwhich I intended for the two Canoes. those trees appeared tolerably\r\nSound and will make Canoes of 28 feet in length and about 16 or 18\r\ninches deep and from 16 to 24 inches wide. the men with the three axes\r\nSet in and worked untill dark. Sergt. Pryor dressed Some Skins to make\r\nhim Clothes. Gibsons wound looks very well. I dressed it. The horses\r\nbeing fatigued and their feet very Sore, I Shall let them rest a fiew\r\ndays. dureing which time the party intended for to take them by land to\r\nthe Mandans will dress their Skins and make themselves Clothes to bare,\r\nas they are nearly naked. Shields killed a Deer & Buffalow & Shannon a\r\nfaun and a Buffalow & York an Elk one of the buffalow was good meat. I\r\nhad the best of him brought in and cut thin and Spread out to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 21, 1806]\r\nMonday 21st July 1806\r\nThis morning I was informed that Half of our horses were absent. Sent\r\nout Shannon Bratten, and Shabono to hunt them. Shabono went up the\r\nriver Shanon down and Bratten in the bottom near Camp, Shabono and\r\nBratten returned at 10 A M and informed me that they Saw no Signs of\r\nthe horses. Shannon proceeded on down the river about 14 miles and did\r\nnot return untill late in the evening, he was equally unsuckcessfull.\r\nShannon informed me that he Saw a remarkable large Lodge about 12 miles\r\nbelow, covered with bushes and the top Deckorated with Skins &c and had\r\nthe appearance of haveing been built about 2 years. I Sent out two men\r\non hors back to kill a fat Cow which they did and returned in 3 hours\r\nthe men work very diligiently on the Canoes one of them nearly finished\r\nready to put in the water. Gibsons wound is beginning to heal. I am in\r\ngreat hope that it will get well in time for him to accompany Sgt.\r\n\r\nPryor with the horses to the Mandans. This evening late a very black\r\nCloud from the S. E. accompanied with Thunder and lightning with hard\r\nwinds which Shifted about and was worm and disagreeable. I am\r\napprehensive that the indians have Stolen our horses, and probably\r\nthose who had made the Smoke a fiew days passed towards the S. W. I\r\ndeturmined to have the ballance of the horses guarded and for that\r\npurpose sent out 3 men, on their approach near the horses were So\r\nalarmed that they ran away and entered the woods and the men returned-\r\na Great number of Geese which raise their young on this river passed\r\ndown frequently Since my arival at this place. we appear to be in the\r\nbeginning of the buffalow Country. the plains are butifull and leavel\r\nbut the Soil is but thin Stoney and in maney parts of the plains &\r\nbottoms there are great quantity of prickly pears. Saw Several herds of\r\nbuffalow Since I arived at this Camp also antilops, wolves, pigions,\r\nDovs, Hawks, ravins, Crows, larks, Sparrows, Eagles & bank martins &c.\r\n&c. The wolves which are the constant attendants of the Buffalow are in\r\ngreat numbers on the Scerts of those large gangues which are to be Seen\r\nin every direction in those praries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 22, 1806]\r\nTuesday 22nd of July 1806.\r\nThe wind continued to blow very hard from the N. E. and a little before\r\nday light was moderately Cool. I Sent Sergt. Pryor and Shabono in Serch\r\nof the horses with directions to proceed up the river as far as the 1st\r\nnarrows and examine particularly for their tracks, they returned at 3 P\r\nM and informed me that they had proceeded up the distance I derected\r\nthem to go and could See neither horses nor tracks; the Plains\r\nimediately out from Camp is So dry and hard that the track of a horse\r\nCannot be Seen without close examination. I therefore derected Sergt.\r\nPryor Shannon Shabono & Bratten to incircle the Camp at Some distance\r\naround and find the tracks of the horses and prosue them, they Serched\r\nfor tracks all the evening without finding which Course the horses had\r\ntaken, the plains being so remarkably hard and dry as to render it\r\nimpossible to See a track of a horse passing through the hard parts of\r\nthem. begin to Suspect that they are taken by the Indians and taken\r\nover the hard plains to prevent our following them. my Suspicions is\r\ngrounded on the improbibility of the horses leaveing the grass and\r\nrushes of the river bottoms of which they are very fond, and takeing\r\nimediately out into the open dry plains where the grass is but Short\r\nand dry. if they had Continued in the bottoms either up or down, their\r\ntracks Could be followed very well. I directed Labeech who understands\r\ntraking very well to Set out early in the morning and find what rout\r\nthe horses had taken if possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 23, 1806]\r\nWednesday 23rd July 1806.\r\nlast night the wolves or dogs came into our Camp and eat the most of\r\nour dryed meat which was on a scaffold Labeech went out early agreeable\r\nto my directions of last evening. Sergt. Pryor and Windser also went\r\nout. Sgt. pryor found an Indian Mockerson and a Small piece of a roab,\r\nthe mockerson worn out on the bottom & yet wet, and have every\r\nappearance of haveing been worn but a fiew hours before. those Indian\r\nSigns is Conclusive with me that they have taken the 24 horses which we\r\nlost on the night of the 10th instant, and that those who were about\r\nlast night were in Serch of the ballance of our horses which they could\r\nnot find as they had fortunately got into a Small Prarie Serounded with\r\nthick timber in the bottom. Labeech returned haveing taken a great\r\nCircle and informed me that he Saw the tracks of the horses makeing off\r\ninto the open plains and were by the tracks going very fast. The\r\nIndians who took the horses bent their course reather down the river.\r\nthe men finished both Canoes by 12 oClock to day, and I sent them to\r\nmake Oars & get poles after which I sent Shields and Labeech to kill a\r\nfat Buffalow out of a gangue which has been in a fiew miles of us all\r\nday. I gave Sergt Pryor his instructions and a letter to Mr. Haney and\r\ndirected that he G. Shannon & Windser take the remaining horses to the\r\nMandans, where he is to enquire for Mr. H. Heney if at the\r\nestablishments on the Assinniboin river to take 12 or 14 horses and\r\nproceed on to that place and deliver Mr. Heney the letter which is with\r\na view to engage Mr. Heney to provale on some of the best informed and\r\nmost influential Chiefs of the different bands of Sieoux to accompany\r\nus to the Seat of our Government with a view to let them See our\r\npopulation and resourses &c. which I believe is the Surest garentee of\r\nSavage fidelity to any nation that of a Governmt. possessing the power\r\nof punishing promptly every aggression. Sergt. Pryor is directed to\r\nleave the ballance of the horses with the grand Chief of the Mandans\r\nuntill our arival at his village also to keep a journal of the of his\r\nrout courses distances water courss Soil production, & animals to be\r\nparticularly noted. Shields and Labeech killed three buffalow two of\r\nthem very fat I had as much of the meat Saved as we could Conveniently\r\nCarry. in the evening had the two Canoes put into the water and lashed\r\ntogether ores and everything fixed ready to Set out early in the\r\nmorning, at which time I have derected Sergt. Pryor to Set out with the\r\nhorses and proceed on to the enterance of the big horn river at which\r\nplace the Canoes will meat him and Set him across the Rochejhone below\r\nthe enterance of that river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 23, 1806]\r\nSpeech for Yellowstone Indians\r\nChildren.

I deturmined to Set the horses\r\nacross on S. Side. one Chanel of the river passes under a high black\r\nbluff from one mile below the place we built the Canoes to within 3\r\nmiles of the enterance of Clarks fork when the bottoms widen on each\r\nside those on the Stard Side from 1/2 to a mile in width. river much\r\ndivided by Islands. at 6 ms. below the fork I halted on a large Island\r\nSeperated from the Stard. Shore by a narrow Channel, on this This being\r\na good place to Cross the river I deturmined to wait for Sergt. pryor\r\nand put him across the river at this place. on this Island I observd a\r\nlarge lodge the Same which Shannon informed me of a fiew days past.\r\nthis Lodge a council lodge, it is of a Conocil form 60 feet diamuter at\r\nits base built of 20 poles each pole 21/2 feet in Secumpheranc and 45\r\nfeet Long built in the form of a lodge & covered with bushes. in this\r\nLodge I observed a Cedar bush Sticking up on the opposit side of the\r\nlodge fronting the dore, on one side was a Buffalow head, and on the\r\nother Several Sticks bent and Stuck in the ground. a Stuffed Buffalow\r\nskin was Suspended from the Center with the back down. the top of those\r\npoles were deckerated with feathers of the Eagle & Calumet Eagle also\r\nSeveral Curious pieces of wood bent in Circleler form with sticks\r\nacross them in form of a Griddle hung on tops of the lodge poles others\r\nin form of a large Sturrip. This Lodge was errected last Summer. It is\r\nSituated in the Center of a butifull Island thinly Covered with Cotton\r\nwood under which the earth which is rich is Covered with wild rye and a\r\nSpecies of grass resembling the bluegrass, and a mixture of Sweet grass\r\nwhich the Indian plat and ware around their necks for its cent which is\r\nof a Strong sent like that of the Vinella after Dinner I proceeded on\r\npassed the enterance of a Small Creek and Some wood on the Stard. Side\r\nwhere I met with Sergt. Pryor, Shannon & Windser with the horses they\r\nhad but just arived at that place. Sergt. Pryor informed me that it\r\nwould be impossible for the two men with him to drive on the horses\r\nafter him without tireing all the good ones in pursute of the more\r\nindifferent to keep them on the Course. that in passing every gangue of\r\nbuffalow Several of which he had met with, the loos horses as Soon as\r\nthey Saw the Buffalow would imediately pursue them and run around them.\r\nAll those that Speed suffient would head the buffalow and those of less\r\nSpeed would pursue on as fast as they Could. he at length found that\r\nthe only practiacable method would be for one of them to proceed on and\r\nwhen ever they Saw a gang of Buffalow to Scear them off before the\r\nhorses got up. This disposition in the horses is no doubt owing to\r\ntheir being frequently exercised in chasing different animals by their\r\nformer owners the Indians as it is their Custom to chase every Speces\r\nof wild animal with horses, for which purpose they train all their\r\nhorses. I had the horses drove across the river and Set Sergt. Pryor\r\nand his party across. H. Hall who cannot Swim expressed a Wiliness to\r\nproceed on with Sergt. Pryor by land, and as another man was necessary\r\nto assist in driveing on the horses, but observed he was necked, I gave\r\nhim one of my two remaining Shirts a par of Leather Legins and 3 pr. of\r\nmockersons which equipt him Completely and Sent him on with the party\r\nby land to the Mandans. I proceeded on the river much better than above\r\nthe enterance of the Clarks fork deep and the Current regularly rapid\r\nfrom 2 to 300 yards in width where it is all together, much divided by\r\nislands maney of which are large and well Supplyed with Cotton wood\r\ntrees, Some of them large, Saw emenc number of Deer Elk and buffalow on\r\nthe banks. Some beaver. I landed on the Lard Side walked out into the\r\nbottom and Killd the fatest Buck I every Saw, Shields killed a deer and\r\nmy man York killed a Buffalow Bull, as he informed me for his tongue\r\nand marrow bones. for me to mention or give an estimate of the\r\ndifferant Spcies of wild animals on this river particularly Buffalow,\r\nElk Antelopes & Wolves would be increditable. I shall therefore be\r\nsilent on the Subject further. So it is we have a great abundance of\r\nthe best of meat. we made 70 ms. to day Current rapid and much divided\r\nby islands. Campd a little below Pryers river of 35 yds. on S E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 25, 1806]\r\nFriday 25th July 1806.\r\nWe Set out at Sunrise and proceeded on very well for three hours. Saw a\r\nlarge gange of Buffalow on the Lard Bank. I concluded to halt and kill\r\na fat one, dureing which time Some brackfast was ordered to be Cooked.\r\nwe killed 2 Buffalow and took as much of their flesh as I wished.\r\nShields killed two fat deer and after a delay of one hour and a half we\r\nagain proceeded on. and had not proceeded far before a heavy shower of\r\nrain pored down upon us, and the wind blew hard from the S W. the wind\r\nincreased and the rain continued to fall. I halted on the Stard. Side\r\nhad Some logs set up on end close together and Covered with deerskins\r\nto keep off the rain, and a large fire made to dry ourselves.\r\n\r\nthe rain continued moderately untill near twelve oClock when it Cleared\r\naway and become fair. the wind Contined high untill 2 P M. I proceeded\r\non after the rain lay a little and at 4 P M arived at a remarkable rock\r\nSituated in an extensive bottom on the Stard. Side of the river & 250\r\npaces from it. this rock I ascended and from it's top had a most\r\nextensive view in every direction. This rock which I shall Call Pompy's\r\nTower is 200 feet high and 400 paces in secumphrance and only\r\naxcessable on one Side which is from the N. E the other parts of it\r\nbeing a perpendicular Clift of lightish Coloured gritty rock on the top\r\nthere is a tolerable Soil of about 5 or 6 feet thick Covered with Short\r\ngrass. The Indians have made 2 piles of Stone on the top of this Tower.\r\nThe nativs have ingraved on the face of this rock the figures of\r\nanimals &c. near which I marked my name and the day of the month &\r\nyear. From the top of this Tower I Could discover two low Mountains &\r\nthe Rocky Mts. covered with Snow S W. one of them appeard to be\r\nextencive and bore S. 15° E. about 40 miles. the other I take to be what\r\nthe indians Call the Little wolf Mtn. I can only see the Southern\r\nextremity of it which bears N 55° W about 35 Miles. The plains to the\r\nSouth rise from the distance of about 6 miles the width of the bottom\r\ngradually to the mountains in that derection. a large Creek with an\r\nextencive Vally the direction of which is S. 25° E. meanders boutifully\r\nthrough this plain. a range of high land Covered with pine appears to\r\nrun in a N. & S. direction approaching the river below. on the\r\nNortherly Side of the river high romantic Clifts approach &jut over the\r\nwater for Some distance both above and below. a large Brooks which at\r\nthis time has Some running muddy water falls in to the Rochejhone\r\nimediately opposit Pompys Tower. back from the river for Some distance\r\non that Side the hills are ruged & some pine back the plains are open\r\nand extensive. after Satisfying my Self Sufficiently in this\r\ndelightfull prospect of the extensive Country around, and the emence\r\nherds of Buffalow, Elk and wolves in which it abounded, I decended and\r\nproceeded on a fiew miles, Saw a gang of about 40 Big horn animals\r\nfired at them and killed 2 on the Sides of the rocks which we did not\r\nget. I directed the Canoes to land, and I walked up through a crevis in\r\nthe rocks almost inaxcessiable and killed 2 of those animals one a\r\nlarge doe and the other a yearlin Buck. I wished very much to kill a\r\nlarge buck, had there been one with the gang I Should have killd. him.\r\ndureing the time the men were getting the two big horns which I had\r\nkilled to the river I employed my Self in getting pieces of the rib of\r\na fish which was Semented within the face of the rock this rib is about\r\n3 inchs in Secumpherance about the middle it is 3 feet in length tho a\r\npart of the end appears to have been broken off I have Several peces of\r\nthis rib the bone is neither decayed nor petrified but very rotten. the\r\npart which I could not get out may be Seen, it is about 6 or 7 Miles\r\nbelow Pompys Tower in the face of the Lard. Clift about 20 feet above\r\nthe water. after getting the big horn on board &c I proceeded on a\r\nShort distance and encamped, an earlyer than I intended on accout of a\r\nheavy cloud which was comeing up from the S. S W. and Some appearance\r\nof a Violent wind. I walked out and killed a Small Buck for his Skin\r\nwhich the party are in want of for Clothes. about Sunset the wind blew\r\nhard from the W. and Some little rain. I encamped on the Stard.

The Country back on each Side is\r\nwavering lands with Scattering pine. passed 2 Small Brooks on the\r\nStard. Side and two large ones on the Lard. Side. I shot a Buck from\r\nthe Canoe and killed one other on a Small Island. and late in the\r\nevening passed a part of the river which was rock under the Lard.\r\nClifts fortunately for us we found an excellent Chanel to pass down on\r\nthe right of a Stony Island half a mile below this bad place, we arived\r\nat the enterance of Big Horn River on the Stard. Side here I landed\r\nimediately in the point which is a Sof mud mixed with the Sand and\r\nSubject to overflow for Some distance back in between the two rivers. I\r\nwalked up the big horn 1/2 a mile and crossed over to the lower Side,\r\nand formed a Camp on a high point. I with one of my men Labeech walked\r\nup the N E Side of Big horn river 7 miles to th enterance of a Creek\r\nwhich falls in on the N E. Side and is 28 yds wide Some running water\r\nwhich is very muddy this Creek I call Muddy Creek Some fiew miles above\r\nthis Creek the river bent around to the East of South. The Courses as I\r\nassended it as follows Viz:\r\n\r\nThe bottoms of the Big Horn river are extencive and Covered with timber\r\nprincipally Cotton. it's Current is regularly Swift, like the Missouri,\r\nit washes away its banks on one Side while it forms extensive Sand bars\r\non the other. Contains much less portion of large gravel than the R.\r\nRochjhone and its water more mudy and of a brownish colour, while that\r\nof the rochejhone is of a lightish Colour. the width of those two\r\nrivers are very nearly the Same imediately at their enterances the\r\nriver Rochejhone much the deepest and contain most water. I measured\r\nthe debth of the bighorn quit across a 1/2 a mile above its junction\r\nand found it from 5 to 7 feet only while that of the River is in the\r\ndeepest part 10 or 12 feet water on the lower Side of the bighorn is\r\nextencive boutifull and leavil bottom thinly covered with Cotton wood\r\nunder which there grows great quantities of rose bushes. I am informed\r\nby the Menetarres Indians and others that this River takes its rise in\r\nthe Rocky mountains with the heads of the river plate and at no great\r\ndistance from the river Rochejhone and passes between the Coat Nor or\r\nBlack Mountains and the most Easterly range of Rocky Mountains. it is\r\nvery long and Contains a great perpotion of timber on which there is a\r\nvariety of wild animals, perticularly the big horn which are to be\r\nfound in great numbers on this river. Buffalow, Elk, Deer and Antelopes\r\nare plenty and the river is Said to abound in beaver. it is inhabited\r\nby a great number of roveing Indians of the Crow Nation, the paunch\r\nNation and the Castahanas all of those nations who are Subdivided rove\r\nand prosue the Buffalow of which they make their principal food, their\r\nSkins together with those of the Big horn and Antilope Serve them for\r\nClothes. This river is Said to be navagable a long way for perogus\r\nwithout falls and waters a fine rich open Country. it is 200 yds water\r\n& 1/4 of a Me. wd. I returned to Camp a little after dark, haveing\r\nkilled one deer, finding my Self fatigued went to bead without my\r\nSupper. Shields killed 2 Bull & 3 Elk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 27, 1806]\r\nSunday 27th July 1806\r\nI marked my name with red paint on a Cotton tree near my Camp, and Set\r\nout at an early hour and proceeded on very well the river is much wider\r\nfrom 4 to 600 yards much divided by Islands and Sand bars, passed a\r\nlarge dry Creek at 15 miles and halted at the enterance of River 50\r\nyards wide on the Lard Side I call R. Labeech killed 4 Buffalow and\r\nSaved as much of their flesh as we could Carry took brackfast. The\r\nBuffalow and Elk is estonishingly noumerous on the banks of the river\r\non each Side, particularly the Elk which lay on almost every point in\r\nlarge gang and are So jintle that we frequently pass within 20 or 30\r\npaces of them without their being the least alarmd. the buffalow are\r\nGenerally at a greater distance from the river, and keep a continueing\r\nbellowing in every direction, much more beaver Sign than above the\r\nbighorn. I Saw Several of those animals on the bank to day. the\r\nantilopes are Scerce as also the bighorns and the deer by no means So\r\nplenty as they were near the Rocky mountains. when we pass the Big horn\r\nI take my leave of the view of the tremendious chain of Rocky Mountains\r\nwhite with Snow in view of which I have been Since the 1st of May last.\r\n\r\nabout Sunset I Shot a very large fat buck elk from the Canoe near which\r\nI encamped, and was near being bit by a rattle Snake.

I intended to encamp on an eligable Spot\r\nimediately below this river, but finding that its water So muddy and\r\nworm as to render it very disagreeable to drink, I crossed the\r\nrochejhone and encamped on an island close to the Lard. Shore. The\r\nwater of this river is nearly milk worm very muddy and of a lightish\r\nbrown Colour. the Current rapid and the Chanel Contains great numbers\r\nof Snags. near its enterance there is great quantities of wood Such as\r\nis common in the low bottoms of the Rochejhone and Missouri. tho I\r\nbelieve that the Country back thro which this river passes is an open\r\none where the water is exposed to the Sun which heats it in its\r\npassage. it is Shallow and throws out great quantities of mud and Some\r\ncors gravel. below this river and on the Stard Side at a fiew Miles\r\nfrom the Rochejhone the hills are high and ruged Containing Coal in\r\ngreat quantities.

This is by far the wost\r\nplace which I have Seen on this river from the Rocky mountains to this\r\nplace a distance of 694 miles by water. a Perogu or large Canoe would\r\nwith Safty pass through the worst of those Shoals, which I call the\r\nBuffalow Sholes from the Circumstance of one of those animals being in\r\nthem. the rock which passes the river at those Sholes appear hard and\r\ngritty of a dark brown Colour. the Clifts on the Stard. Side is about\r\n100 feet in hight, on the Lard Side the Country is low and the bottom\r\nrises gradually back. here is the first appearance of Birnt hills which\r\nI have Seen on this river they are at a distance from the river on the\r\nLard Side. I landed at the enterance of a dry Creek on the Lard side\r\nbelow the Shoals and took brackfast. Those Dry Rivers, Creeks &c are\r\nlike those of the Missouri which take their rise in and are the\r\nConveyance of the water from those plains. they have the appearanc of\r\ndischargeing emence torrents of water. the late rains which has fallen\r\nin the plains raised Sudenly those Brooks which receive the water of\r\nthose plains on which those Suden & heavy Showers of rain must have\r\nfallen, Several of which I have Seen dischargeing those waters, whiles\r\nthose below heading or takeing their rise in the Same neighbourhood, as\r\nI passed them appears to have latterly been high. those Broods\r\ndischarge emencely of mud also, which Contributes much to the muddiness\r\nof the river. after Brackfast proceeded on the river much narrower than\r\nabove from 3 to 400 yards wide only and only a fiew scattering trees to\r\nbe Seen on the banks. at 20 miles below the Buffalow Shoals passed a\r\nrapid which is by no means dangerous, it has a number of large rocks in\r\ndifferent parts of the river which Causes high waves a very good Chanel\r\non the Lard.

W. obliged us to land imediately below\r\nthis rapid, draw up the Canoes and take Shelter in an old Indian Lodge\r\nabove the enterance of a river which is nearly dry it has laterly been\r\nvery high and Spread over nearly 1/4 a mile in width. its Chanel is 88\r\nyards and in this there is not more water than could pass through an\r\ninch auger hole. I call it Yorks dry R. after the rain and wind passed\r\nover I proceeded on at 7 Miles passed the enterance of a river the\r\nwater of which is 100 yds wide, the bead of this river nearly 1/4 of a\r\nmile this river is Shallow and the water very muddy and of the Colour\r\nof the banks a darkish brown. I observe great quantities of red Stone\r\nthrown out of this river that from the appearance of the hills at a\r\ndistance on its lower Side induced me to call this red Stone river. as\r\nthe water was disagreeably muddy I could not Camp on that Side below\r\nits mouth. however I landed at its enteranc and Sent out and killed two\r\nfat Cows, and took as much of the flesh as the Canoes would\r\nconveniently Carry and Crossed the river and encamped at the enterance\r\nof a Brook on the Lard. Side under a large Spredding Cotton tree. The\r\nriver on which we passed to day is not So wide as above containing but\r\nfiew islands with a Small quantity of Cotton timber. no timber of any\r\nkind to be Seen on the high lands on either Side.\r\n\r\nIn the evening below the enterance of redstone river I observed great\r\nnumbers of Buffalow feeding on the plains, elk on the points and\r\nantilopes. I also Saw Some of the Bighorn animals at a distance on the\r\nhills. Gibson is now able to walk, he walked out this evening and\r\nkilled an antilope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, July 31, 1806]\r\nSaturday 31st of July 1806\r\nI was much disturbed last night by the noise of the buffalow which were\r\nabout me. one gang Swam the river near our Camp which alarmed me a\r\nlittle for fear of their Crossing our Canoes and Splitting them to\r\npieces. Set out as usial about Sun rise passed a rapid which I call\r\nwolf rapid from the Circumstance of one of those animals being at the\r\nrapid. here the river approaches the high mountanious Country on the N\r\nW. Side those hills appear to be composed of various Coloured earth and\r\nCoal without much rock I observe Several Conical mounds which appear to\r\nhave been burnt. this high Country is washed into Curious formed mounds\r\n& hills and is cut much with reveens. the Country again opens and at\r\nthe distance of 23 miles below the Redston or War-har-sah River I\r\nlanded in the enterance of a Small river on the Stard. Side 40 yards\r\nwid Shallow and muddy. it has lately been very high. haveing passed the\r\nEnterance of a River on the Lard Side 100 yards wide which has running\r\nwater this river I take to be the one the Menetarries Call little wolf\r\nor Sa-a-shah River The high Country is entirely bar of timber. great\r\nquantities of Coal or carbonated wood is to be seen in every Bluff and\r\nin the high hills at a distance on each Side. Saw more Buffalow and Elk\r\nand antilopes this evening than usial. 18 Miles below the last river on\r\nthe Stard. Side, I passed one 60 yards wide which had running water.\r\nthis Stream I call oak-tar-pon-er or Coal River has very steep banks on\r\neach side of it. passed Several large Brooks Some of them had a little\r\nrunning water, also Several Islands Some high black looking Bluffs and\r\nencamped on the Stard. Side on a low point. the country like that of\r\nyesterday is open extencive plains. as I was about landing this evening\r\nSaw a white bear and the largest I ever Saw eating a dead buffalow on a\r\nSand bar. we fired two Shot into him, he Swam to the main Shore and\r\nwalked down the bank. I landed and fired 2 more Shot into this\r\ntremendious animal without killing him. night comeing on we Could not\r\npursue him he bled profusely. Showers all this day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 1, 1806]\r\nSunday 1st of August 1806.\r\nWe Set out early as usial the wind was high and ahead which caused the\r\nwater to be a little rough and delayed us very much aded to this we had\r\nShowers of rain repeetedly all day at the intermition of only a fiew\r\nminits between them. My Situation a very disagreeable one. in an open\r\nCanoe wet and without a possibility of keeping my Self dry. the Country\r\nthrough which we passed is in every respect like that through which I\r\npassed yesterday. The brooks have all Some water in them from the rains\r\nwhich has fallen. this water is excessively muddy. Several of those\r\nbrooks have Some trees on their borders as far as I can See up them. I\r\nobserve Some low pine an cedar on the Sides of the rugid hills on the\r\nStard. Side, and Some ash timber in the high bottoms. the river has\r\nmore Sand bars today than usial, and more Soft mud. the current less\r\nrapid. at 2 P.M. I was obliged to land to let the Buffalow Cross over.\r\nnot withstanding an island of half a mile in width over which this\r\ngangue of Buffalow had to pass and the Chanel of the river on each Side\r\nnearly 1/4 of a mile in width, this gangue of Buffalow was entirely\r\nacross and as thick as they could Swim. the Chanel on the Side of the\r\nisland the went into the river was crouded with those animals for 1/2\r\nan hour. the other Side of the island for more than 3/4 of an hour. I\r\ntook 4 of the men and killed 4 fat Cows for their fat and what portion\r\nof their flesh the Small Canoes Could Carry that which we had killed a\r\nfew days ago being nearly Spoiled from the wet weather. encamped on an\r\nIsland Close to the Lard Shore two gangues of Buffalow Crossed a little\r\nbelow us, as noumerous as the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 2, 1806]\r\nMonday August 2nd 1806.\r\nMusquetors very troublesom this morning I Set out early river wide and\r\nvery much divided by islands and Sand and Mud bars. the bottoms more\r\nextencive and contain more timber Such as Cotton wood ash willow &c.\r\nThe Country on the N W. Side rises to a low plain and extends leavel\r\nfor great extent. Some high rugid hills in the forepart of this day on\r\nthe S E. Side on which I saw the big horns but could not get near them.\r\nSaw emence numbers of Elk Buffalow and wolves to day. the wolves do\r\ncatch the elk. I saw 2 wolves in pursute of doe Elk which I beleive\r\nthey Cought they very near her when She entered a Small wood in which I\r\nexpect they cought her as She did not pass out of the small wood during\r\nmy remaining in view of it which was 15 or 20 minits &c. passed the\r\nenterance of Several brooks on each Side, a Small river 30 yds wide\r\nwith Steep banks on the Stard. Side, which I call Ibex River the river\r\nin this days decent is less rapid crouded with Islds and muddy bars and\r\nis generally about one mile in wedth. as the islands and bars\r\nfrequently hide the enterance of Brooks &c. from me as I pass'd maney\r\nof them I have not noticed. about 8 A. M this morning a Bear of the\r\nlarge vicious Species being on a Sand bar raised himself up on his hind\r\nfeet and looked at us as we passed down near the middle of the river.\r\nhe plunged into the water and Swam towards us, either from a\r\ndisposition to attack't or from the Cent of the meat which was in the\r\nCanoes. we Shot him with three balls and he returned to Shore badly\r\nwounded. in the evening I saw a very large Bear take the water above\r\nus. I ordered the boat to land on the opposit Side with a view to\r\nattack't him when he Came within Shot of the Shore. when the bear was\r\nin a fiew paces of the Shore I Shot it in the head. the men hauled her\r\non Shore and proved to be an old Shee which was so old that her tuskes\r\nhad worn Smooth, and Much the largest feemale bear I ever Saw. after\r\ntaking off her Skin, I proceeded on and encampd a little above the\r\nenterance of Jo. Feilds Creek on Stard. Side in a high bottom Covered\r\nwith low Ash and elm. the Musquetors excessively troublesom.\r\n\r\nI have noticed a great preportion Buck Elks on this lower part of the\r\nriver, and but very few above. those above which are emencely noumerous\r\nare feemales Generally. Shields killed a Deer this morning dureing the\r\ntime we were at Brackfast. we were very near being detained by the\r\nBuffalow today which were Crossing the river we got through the line\r\nbetween 2 gangues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 3, 1806]\r\nTueday August 3rd,1806.\r\nlast night the Musquetors was so troublesom that no one of the party\r\nSlept half the night. for my part I did not Sleep one hour. those\r\ntormenting insects found their way into My beare and tormented me the\r\nwhole night. they are not less noumerous or troublesom this morn-ing.\r\nat 2 miles passed the enterance of Jo. Field's Creek 35 yds wide\r\nimediately above a high bluff which is falling into the river very\r\nfast. on the Side of this bluff I saw Some of the Mountain Bighorn\r\nanimals. I assended the hill below the Bluff. the Musquetors were So\r\nnoumerous that I could not Shute with any Certainty and therefore Soon\r\nreturned to the Canoes. I had not proceeded far before I saw a large\r\ngangue of ewes & yearlins & fawns or lambs of the bighorn, and at a\r\ndistance alone I saw a ram. landed and Sent Labeech to kill the ram,\r\nwhich he did kill and brought him on board. this ram is not near as\r\nlarge as maney I have Seen. however he is Sufficiently large for a\r\nSample I directed Bratten to Skin him with his head horns & feet to the\r\nSkin and Save all the bone. I have now the Skin & bone of a Ram a Ewe &\r\na yearlin ram of those big Horn animals. at 8. A.M. I arived at the\r\njunction of the Rochejhone with the Missouri, and formed my Camp\r\nimediately in the point between the two river at which place the party\r\nhad all encamped the 26th of April-1805. at landing I observed Several\r\nElk feeding on the young willows in the point among which was a large\r\nBuck Elk which I shot & had his flesh dryed in the Sun for a Store down\r\nthe river. had the Canoes unloaded and every article exposed to dry &\r\nSun. Maney of our things were wet, and nearly all the Store of meat\r\nwhich had been killed above Spoiled. I ordered it to be thrown into the\r\nriver. Several Skins are also Spoiled which is a loss, as they are our\r\nprincipal dependance for Clothes to last us to our homes &c.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the Rocky Mountains at which place I struck the River\r\nRochejhone to its enterance into the Missouri 837 Miles 636 Miles of\r\nthis distance I decended in 2 Small Canoes lashed together in which I\r\nhad the following Persons. John Shields, George Gibson, William\r\nBratten, W. Labeech, Toust. Shabono his wife & child & my man York. The\r\nRochejhone or Yellow Stone river is large and navagable with but fiew\r\nobstructions quite into the rocky mountains. and probably near it's\r\nsource. The Country through which it passes from those Mounts. to its\r\njunction is Generaly fertile rich open plains the upper portion of\r\nwhich is roleing and the high hills and hill Sides are partially\r\ncovered with pine and Stoney. The middle portion or from the enterance\r\nof Clarks Fork as low as the Buffalow Shoals the high lands Contain\r\nSome Scattering pine on the Lard. Side. on the Stard. or S. E. Side is\r\nSome hills thickly Supplied with pine. The lower portion of the river\r\nbut fiew pines are to be Seen the Country opens into extencive plains\r\nriver widens and Contains more islands and bars; of corse gravel sand\r\nand Mud. The Current of this river may be estimated at 4 Miles and 1/2\r\npr. hour from the Rocky Mts. as low as Clarks Fork, at 31/2 Miles pr.\r\nhour from thence as low as the Bighorn, at 3--Miles pr. hour from\r\nthence as low as the Tongue river, at 23/4 Miles pr. hour from thence\r\nas low as Wolf rapid and at 21/2 miles pr. hour from thence to its\r\nenterance into the Missouri\r\n\r\nThe Colour of the Water differs from that of the Missouri it being of a\r\nyellowish brown, whilst that of the Missouri is of a deep drab Colour\r\ncontaining a greater portion of mud than the Rochejhone. This\r\ndelighfull river from indian information has it's extreem sources with\r\nthe North river in the Rocky mountains on the confines of New Mexico.\r\nit also most probably has it's westerly sources connected with the\r\nMultnomah and those the main Southerly branch of Lewis's river while\r\nit's Easterly branches head with those of Clark's R. the bighorn and\r\nRiver Platte and may be said to water the middle portion of the Rocky\r\nMountains from N W to S. E. for several hundred miles. the indians\r\ninform us, that a good road passes up this river to it's extreem source\r\nfrom whence it is buta short distance to the Spanish settlements. there\r\nis also a considerable fall on this river within the mountains but at\r\nwhat distance from it's source we never could learn like all other\r\nbranches of the Missouri which penetrate the Rocky Mountains all that\r\nportion of it lying within those mountains abound in fine beaver and\r\nOtter, it's streams also which issuing from the rocky mountain and\r\ndischarging themselves above Clark's fork inclusive also furnish an\r\nabundance of beaver and Otter and possess considerable portions of\r\nsmall timber in their values. to an establishment on this river at\r\nclarks Fork the Shoshones both within and West of the Rocky Mountains\r\nwould willingly resort for the purposes of trade as they would in a\r\ngreat measure be relived from the fear of being attacked by their\r\nenimies the blackfoot Indians and Minnetares of fort de Prarie, which\r\nwould most probably happen were they to visit any establishment which\r\ncould be conveniently formed on the Missouri. I have no doubt but the\r\nsame regard to personal safety would also induce many numerous nations\r\ninhabiting the Columbia and Lewis's river West of the mountains to\r\nvisit this establishment in preference to that at the entrance of\r\nMaria's river, particularly during the first years of those Western\r\nestablishments. the Crow Indians, Paunch Indians Castahanah's and\r\nothers East of the mountains and south of this place would also visit\r\nthis establishment; it may therefore be looked to as one of the most\r\nimportant establishments of the western fur trade. at the entrance of\r\nClark's fork there is a sufficiency of timber to support an\r\nestablishment, an advantage that no position possesses from thence to\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. The banks of the yellowstone river a bold not very\r\nhigh yet are not subject to be overflown, except for a few miles\r\nimmediately below where the river issues from the mountain. the bed of\r\nthis river is almost entirely composed of loose pebble, nor is it's bed\r\ninterrupted by chains of rock except in one place and that even\r\nfurnishes no considerable obstruction to it's navigation. as you decend\r\nwith the river from the mountain the pebble becomes smaller and the\r\nquantity of mud increased untill you reah Tongue river where the pebble\r\nceases and the sand then increases and predominates near it's mouth.\r\nThis river can be navigated to greater advantage in perogues than any\r\nother craft yet it possesses suficient debth of water for battauxs even\r\nto the mountains; nor is there any of those moving sand bars so\r\nformidable to the navigation of many parts of the Missouri. The Bighorn\r\nR and Clark's fork may be navigated a considerable distance in perogues\r\nand canoes. Tongue river is also navigable for canoes a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 4, 1806]\r\nWednesday 4th August 1806\r\nMusquetors excessively troublesom So much So that the men complained\r\nthat they could not work at their Skins for those troublesom insects.\r\nand I find it entirely impossible to hunt in the bottoms, those insects\r\nbeing So noumerous and tormenting as to render it imposseable for a man\r\nto continue in the timbered lands and our best retreat from those\r\ninsects is on the Sand bars in the river and even those Situations are\r\nonly clear of them when the Wind Should happen to blow which it did to\r\nday for a fiew hours in the middle of the day. the evenings nights and\r\nmornings they are almost indureable perticelarly by the party with me\r\nwho have no Bears to keep them off at night, and nothing to Screen them\r\nbut their blankets which are worn and have maney holes. The torments of\r\nthose Missquetors and the want of a Sufficety of Buffalow meat to dry,\r\nthose animals not to be found in this neighbourhood induce me to\r\ndeturmine to proceed on to a more eliagiable Spot on the Missouri below\r\nat which place the Musquetors will be less troublesom and Buffalow more\r\nplenty. (I will here obseve that Elk is Abundant but their flesh & fat\r\nis hard to dry in the Sun, and when dry is much easirSpoiled than\r\neither the Buffalow or Deer) I ordered the Canoes to be reloaded with\r\nour baggage & dryed meat which had been Saved on the Rochejhone\r\ntogether with the Elk killed at this place. wrote a note to Capt Lewis\r\ninforming him of my intentions and tied it to a pole which I had Stuck\r\nup in the point. At 5 P. M Set out and proceeded on down to the 2d\r\npoint which appeared to be an eligable Situation for my purpose killed\r\na porcupine on this point the Musquetors were So abundant that we were\r\ntormented much worst than at the point. The Child of Shabono has been\r\nSo much bitten by the Musquetor that his face is much puffed up &\r\nSwelled. I encamped on this extensive Sand bar which is on the N W.\r\nSide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 5, 1806]\r\nThursday 5th August 1806.\r\nThe Musquetors was So troublesom to the men last night that they Slept\r\nbut very little. indeed they were excessive troublesom to me. my\r\nMusquetor Bear has a number of Small holes worn through they pass in. I\r\nSet out at an early hour intending to proceed to Some other Situation.\r\nI had not proceded on far before I Saw a ram of the big horn Animal\r\nnear the top of a Lard. Bluff I assended the hill with a view to kill\r\nthe ram. the Misquetors was So noumerous that I could not keep them off\r\nmy gun long enough to take Sight and by thair means missed. at 10 a.m.\r\nthe wind rose with a gentle breeze from the N. W. which in Some measure\r\nthinned the Misquetors. I landed on a Sand bar from the South Point\r\nintending to form a Camp at this place and Continue untill Capt Lewis\r\nShould arive. and killed two Buck Elks and a Deer the best of their\r\nflesh & fat I had Saved. had all the dryed meat & fat put out to Sun\r\nand continued at this place untill late in the evening finding that\r\nthere were no buffalow or fresh Sign I deturmined to proceed on\r\naccordingly Set out at 4 P. M and proceeded on but a fiew miles eeir I\r\nsaw a Bear of the white Species walking on a Sand bear. I with one man\r\nwent on the Sand bear and killed the Bear which proved to be a feemale\r\nvery large and fat. much the fattest animale we have killed on the rout\r\nas this bear had got into the river before we killed her I had her toed\r\nacross to the South Side under a high Bluff where formed a Camp, had\r\nthe bear Skined and fleaced. our Situation was exposed to a light\r\nbreeze of wind which continued all the forepart of the night from the S\r\nW. and blew away the misquetors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 6, 1806]\r\nFriday 6th August 1806\r\nI rose very wet. about 11 P M last night the wind become very hard for\r\na fiew minits Suckceeded by Sharp lightning and hard Claps of Thunder\r\nand rained for about 2 hours very hard after which it continued Cloudy\r\nthe balance of the night. as we were about Setting out a female Big\r\nhorn animal came on the bluff imediately above us and looked down. I\r\nderected Labeech to Shoot it which he did, after Skinning this animal\r\nwe Set out and proceeded on to a Sand bar on the S W. Side below the\r\nenterance of White earth river where I landed and had the meat Skins\r\nand bedding all put out to dry. wind hard from the N W. I halted on the\r\nN W. Side of this river in the bend above the white earth river, where\r\nI saw where the Indians had been digging a root which they eate and use\r\nin Seup, not more than 7 or 8 days past. This morning a very large Bear\r\nof white Specis, discovered us floating in the water and takeing us, as\r\nI prosume to be Buffalow imediately plunged into the river and prosued\r\nus. I directed the men to be Still. this animal Came within about 40\r\nyards of us, and tacked about. we all fired into him without killing\r\nhim, and the wind So high that we could not pursue him, by which means\r\nhe made his escape to the Shore badly wounded. I have observed buffalow\r\nfloating down which I suppose must have been drounded in Crossing\r\nabove. more or less of those animals drown or mire in passing this\r\nriver. I observed Several floating buffalow on the R. Rochejhone\r\nimediately below where large gangues had Crossed. The wind blew hard\r\nall the after part of the day. I derected the men to dress their Skins\r\nexcept one which I took with me and walkd. through the bottom to the\r\nfoot of the hills I killed five deer and the man with me killed 2. four\r\nothers were killed in the Course of the day by the party only 2 of\r\nthose deer were fat owing as I suppose to the Musquetors which are So\r\nnoumerous and troublesom to them that they Cannot feed except under the\r\ntorments of millions of those Musquetors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 7, 1806]\r\nSaturday 7th August 1806\r\nSome hard rain this morning after daylight which wet us all. I formed a\r\nSort of Camped and delayed untill 11 a.m. when it Stoped raining for a\r\nshort time. I directed every thing put on board and proceeded on down.\r\nthe rain Continued at intervales all day tho not hard in the evenig Saw\r\na Bear on the bank but Could not get a Shoot at it. at 6 P M I landed\r\non a Sand bar on the South Side and Campd. Soon after we landed the\r\nwind blew very hard for about 2 hours, when it lulled a little. the air\r\nwas exceedingly Clear and Cold and not a misquetor to be Seen, which is\r\na joyfull circumstance to the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 8, 1806]\r\nSunday 8th August 1806\r\nA cool windey morning I derected Shields and Gibson to turn out and\r\nhunt this morning. at 8 A.M. Sergt. N. Pryor Shannon, hall & Windsor\r\nCame down the river in two Canoes made of Buffalow Skins. Sergt. Pryor\r\ninformed me that the Second night after he parted with me on the river\r\nRochejhone he arived about 4 P M on the banks of a large Creek which\r\ncontained no running water. he halted to let the horses graze dureing\r\nwhich time a heavy Shower of rain raised the Creek so high that Several\r\nhorses which had Stragled across the Chanel of this Creek was obliged\r\nto Swim back. here he deturmined to Continue all night it being in good\r\nfood for the horses. In the morning he could See no horses. in lookg\r\nabout their Camp they discovered Several tracks within 100 paces of\r\ntheir Camp, which they pursued found where they had Caught and drove\r\noff all the horses. they prosued on five miles the Indians there\r\ndivided into two parties. they Continued in pursute of the largest\r\nparty five miles further finding that there was not the Smallest Chance\r\nof overtakeing them, they returned to their Camp and packed up their\r\nbaggage on their backs and Steared a N. E. course to the River\r\nRochejhone which they Struck at pompys Tower, there they killed a\r\nBuffalow Bull and made a Canoe in the form and shape of the mandans &\r\nRicares (the form of a bason) and made in the following manner. Viz: 2\r\nSticks of 11/4 inch diameter is tied together So as to form a round\r\nhoop of the Size you wish the canoe, or as large as the Skin will allow\r\nto cover, two of those hoops are made one for the top or brim and the\r\nfor the bottom the deabth you wish the Canoe, then Sticks of the Same\r\nSize are Crossed at right angles and fastened with a throng to each\r\nhoop and also where each Stick Crosses each other. then the Skin when\r\ngreen is drawn tight over this fraim and fastened with throngs to the\r\nbrim or outer hoop So as to form a perfect bason. one of those Canoes\r\nwill carry 6 or 8 Men and their loads. Those two Canoes are nearly the\r\nSame Size 7 feet 3 inches diamieter & 16 inchs deep 15 ribs or Cross\r\nSticks in each. Sergt. Pryor informs me that the Cause of his building\r\ntwo Canoes was for fear of ones meating with Some accedent in passing\r\ndown the rochejhone a river entirely unknown to either of them by which\r\nmeans they might loose their guns and amunition and be left entirely\r\ndestitute of the means of precureing food. he informed me that they\r\npassed through the worst parts of the rapids & Shoals in the river\r\nwithout takeing a drop of water, and waves raised from the hardest\r\nwinds dose not effect them. on the night of the 26th ulto. the night\r\nafter the horses had been stolen a Wolf bit Sergt. Pryor through his\r\nhand when asleep, and this animal was So vicious as to make an attempt\r\nto Seize Windsor, when Shannon fortunately Shot him. Sergt. Pryers\r\nhand has nearly recovered. The Country through which St. Pryor Passed\r\nafter he parted with me is a broken open Country. he passed one Small\r\nriver which I have Called Pryors river which rises in a Mtn. to the\r\nSouth of Pompys tower. The note I left on a pole at the Mouth of the\r\nRiver Rochejhone Sergt. Pryor concluding that Capt. Lewis had passed\r\ntook the note and brought it with him. Capt. Lewis I expect will be\r\ncertain of my passing by the Sign which I have made and the encampment\r\nimediately in the point. Sergt. Pryor bing anxious to overtake me Set\r\nout Some time before day this morning and forgot his Saddlebags which\r\ncontains his papers &c. I Sent Bratten back with him in Serch of them.\r\nI also Sent Shannon over to hunt the bottom on the opposit Side.\r\nShields and Gibson returned at 10 A.M. with the Skins and part of the\r\nflesh of three deer which they had killed in this bottom. I derected\r\nthem to take one of the Skin Canoes and proceed down to the next bottom\r\nand untill my arival which will be this evening if Sergt. Pryor returns\r\nin time. My object is to precure as many Skins as possible for the\r\npurpose of purchaseing Corn and Beans of the Mandans. as we have now no\r\narticle of Merchindize nor horses to purchase with, our only resort is S\r\nkins which those people were very fond the winter we were Stationed\r\nnear them. after dark Sergt. Pryor returned with his Saddlebeggs &c.\r\nthey were much further up than he expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 9, 1806]\r\nMonday 9th August 1806\r\na heavy dew this morning. loaded the Canoes and proceeded on down about\r\n6 miles and landed at the Camp of the 2 hunters Shields and Gibson\r\nwhome I had Sent down to hunt last evening, they had killed five deer\r\ntwo of which were in good order which they brought in. here I took\r\nbrackfast and proceeded on a fiew miles and I walked on Shore across a\r\npoint of near 10 miles in extent in this bottom which was mostly open I\r\nsaw Some fiew deer and Elk. I killed 3 of the deer which were Meagure\r\nthe Elk appeared fat. I did not kill any of them as the distance to the\r\nriver was too great for the men to Carry the meat at the lower part of\r\nthis bottom a large Creek of runnig water 25 yds wide falls in which\r\nmeanders through an open roleing plain of great extent. in the low\r\nbottoms of this Creek I observed Some timber Such as Cottonwood, ash &\r\nElm. on my arival at the lower part of the bottom found that the canoes\r\nhad been in waiting for me nearly two hours. The Squar brought me a\r\nlarge and well flavoured Goose berry of a rich Crimsin Colour, and deep\r\npurple berry of the large Cherry of the Current Speces which is common\r\non this river as low as the Mandans, the engagees Call it the Indian\r\nCurrent. I landed opposit to a high plain on the S. E. Side late in the\r\nevening and walked in a Grove of timber where I met with an Elk which I\r\nkilled. this Elk was the largest Buck I ever Saw and the fattest animal\r\nwhich have been killed on the rout. I had the flesh and fat of this Elk\r\nbrought to Camp and cut thin ready to dry. the hunters killed nothing\r\nthis evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 10, 1806]\r\nTuesday 10th August 1806\r\nhad the flesh of the elk hung on poles to dry, and Sent out the the\r\nhunters. wind blew hard from the East all day. in the after part of the\r\nday it was cloudy & a fiew drops of rain. I finished a Copy of my\r\nSketches of the River Rochejhone. Shields killed a black tail deer & an\r\nantilope. the other hunters killed nothing. deer are very Scerce on\r\nthis part of the river. I found a Species of Cherry in the bottom the\r\nSrub or bush which are differant from any which I have ever Seen and\r\nnot very abundant even in this Small tract of country to which it Seems\r\nto be confined. the Stem is compound erect and subdivided or branching\r\nwithout any regular order. it rises to the hight of 8 or 10 feet Seldom\r\nputting out more than one Stem from the Same root not growing in cops\r\nas the Choke Cherry does. the bark is Smooth and of a dark brown\r\ncolour. the leaf is petialate, oval accutely pointed at it's apex, from\r\n1 and a 1/4 to one and a 1/2 inch in length and from a half to 3/4 of\r\nan inch in wedth, finely or manutely Serrate, pale green and free from\r\nbubessance. The fruit is a globular berry about the Size of a buck Shot\r\nof a fine Scarlet red; like the cherries cultivated in the U. States\r\neach is supported by a Seperate Celindric flexable branch peduncle\r\nwhich issues from the extremities of the boughs. the peduncle of this\r\ncherry Swells as it approaches the fruit being largest at the point of\r\ninsertion. the pulp of this fruit is of an agreeable ascid flavour and\r\nis now ripe. the Style and Stigma are permanent. I have never Seen it\r\nin blume. it is found on the high Stiff lands or hill Sides-. the men\r\ndug great parcel of the root which the Nativs call Hankee and the\r\nengagees the white apple which they boiled and made use of with their\r\nmeat. This is a large insipid root and very tasteless. the nativs use\r\nthis root after it is dry and pounded in their Seup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 11, 1806]\r\nWednesday 11th August 1806\r\nI set out early this morning. at 10 A.M. landed on a Sand bar and\r\nbrackfast dureing brackfast and my delay at this place which was 2\r\nhours had the Elk meat exposed to the Sun. at Meridian I set out and\r\nhad not proceeded more than 2 miles before I observed a Canoe near the\r\nShore. I derected the Canoes to land here I found two men from the\r\nillinoies Jos. Dixon, and ____ Handcock those men are on a trapping\r\nexpedition up the River Rochejhone. They inform me that they left the\r\nIllinois in the Summer 1804. the last winter they Spent with the Tetons\r\nin Company with a Mr. Coartong who brought up goods to trade The tetons\r\nrobed him of the greater part of the goods and wounded this Dixon in\r\nthe leg with a hard wad. The Tetons gave Mr. Coartong Some fiew robes\r\nfor the articles they took from him. Those men further informed me that\r\nthey met the Boat and party we Sent down from Fort Mandan near the\r\nKanzas river on board of which was a Chief of the Ricaras, that he met\r\nthe Yankton Chiefs with Mr. Deurion, McClellen & Several other traders\r\non their way down. that the Mandans and Menitarrais wer at war with the\r\nRicaras and had killed two of the latter. the Assinniboins were also at\r\nwar with the Mandans &c and had prohibited the N W. traders from\r\nComeing to the Missouri to trade. they have latterly killed one Trader\r\nnear the Mous River and are now in wait for Mr. McKenzey one of the\r\nClerks who have been for a long time with Menetarias. Those dificulties\r\nif true will I fear be a bar to our expectations of having the Mandan\r\nMinetarra & Ricara Chief to acompany us to the U. States. Tho we Shall\r\nendeaver to bring abot a peace between Mandans Mennetaries & Ricaras\r\nand provail on Some of their Cheifs to accompany us to the U.

I derected him to land his\r\nSkin Canoe and go back to our Camp of last night in Serch of it, and\r\nproceeded on my self with the two wood and one Skin Canoe to a large\r\nhottom on the N. E Side above the head of Jins island and landed to\r\ntake brackfast as well as to delay untill Shannon & Gibson Should\r\narive. Sent out Shields & Labiech to hunt deer in the bottom, at 2 P m.\r\nShannon and gibson arived having found the tomahawk at our camp they\r\nkilled 3 Elk &c. one of the Canoes of Buffalow Skin by accident got a\r\nhole peirced in her of about 6 inches diamuter. I derected two of the\r\nmen to patch the Canoe with a piece of Elk skin over the hole, which\r\nthey did and it proved all Sufficient, after which the Canoe did not\r\nleak one drop. The two hunters returned without haveing killed any\r\nthing. at meridian Capt Lewis hove in Sight with the party which went\r\nby way of the Missouri as well as that which accompanied him from\r\nTravellers rest on Clarks river; I was alarmed on the landing of the\r\nCanoes to be informed that Capt. Lewis was wounded by an accident-. I\r\nfound him lying in the Perogue, he informed me that his wound was\r\nslight and would be well in 20 or 30 days this information relieved me\r\nvery much. I examined the wound and found it a very bad flesh wound the\r\nball had passed through the fleshey part of his left thy below the hip\r\nbone and cut the cheek of the right buttock for 3 inches in length and\r\nthe debth of the ball. Capt L. informed me the accident happened the\r\nday before by one of the men Peter Crusat misstakeig him in the thick\r\nbushes to be an Elk. Capt Lewis with this Crusat and Several other men\r\nwere out in the bottom Shooting of Elk, and had Scattered in a thick\r\npart of the woods in pursute of the Elk. Crusat Seeing Capt L. passing\r\nthrough the bushes and takeing him to be an Elk from the Colour of his\r\nCloathes which were of leather and very nearly that of the Elk fired\r\nand unfortunately the ball passed through the thy as aforesaid. Capt\r\nLewis thinking it indians who had Shot him hobbled to the canoes as\r\nfast as possible and was followered by Crusat, the mistake was then\r\ndiscovered. This Crusat is near Sighted and has the use of but one eye,\r\nhe is an attentive industerous man and one whome we both have placed\r\nthe greatest Confidence in dureing the whole rout.--After Capt. Lewis\r\nand my Self parted at Travellers rest, he with the Indians proceeded\r\ndown the West Side of Clarks river Seven miles and crossed on rafts 2\r\nmiles below the East fork 120 yards wide, after Crossing the river he\r\nproceeded up the North Side of the east fork and encampd. here the\r\nIndians left him and proceeded down Clarks river in Serch of the\r\nTushepaws. an Indian man Came up with Cap L. from the W. of the\r\nmountains and proceeded on with those who had accompanied us. Capt. L.\r\nproceeded up the E. fork of Clarks river 17 ms. to the enterance of\r\nCokahlarishkit river or the river to buffalow, he proceeded up on the\r\nNorth Side of this river which is 60 yards wide crossing Several Small\r\nStreams and the N. fork, and passing over part of the dividing mountain\r\nonto the waters of Deabourns river in the plains and in a Derection to\r\nthe N. extremity of Easte range of rocky mountains which pass the\r\nMissouri at the pine Island Rapid. from thence he bore his Course to\r\nthe N E untill he Struck Meadcin river near where that river Enters the\r\nrocky Mts. and proceeded down Medicine river to the Missouri at the\r\nwhite bear Islands at the upper part of the portage. this rout is a\r\nvery good one tho not the most derect rout, the most derect rout would\r\nbe to proceed up the Missouri above Dearborns river and take a right\r\nhand road & fall on a South branch of the Cokatlarishkit R. and proceed\r\ndown that river to the main road but the best rout would be from the\r\nfalls of the Missouri by fort mountain and passing the N. extremity of\r\nthat range of the Rocky Mountains which pass the Missouri at the pine\r\nIsland rapid Course nearly S. W. and to the gap through which the great\r\nroad passeds the dividing mountain the distance from the falls to this\r\ngap about 45 miles through a tolerable leavel plain on an old indian\r\nroad. and the distance from thence to Clarks river is 105 miles. The\r\ntotal distance from the falls of the Missouri to Clarks river is only\r\n150 miles of a tolerable road--Capt L. arived at the white Bear Islands\r\nand encampd. on the West Side of the Missouri and in the morning he\r\ndiscovered that the Indians had taken of Seven of his best horses,\r\ndrewyer prosued the indians two day's on the rout towards Clarks river.\r\nhe Saw their camp on Dearborns river near the road on which Capt. Lewis\r\n& party Come on a by place where they had left only one or two day at\r\nthis encampment he Saw great appearanc of horses--on the return of\r\nDrewyer Capt L. took Drewyer & the 2 fieldses & proceeded on his\r\nintended rout up Marias river leaving Sergt. Gass, Thompson, Frazier,\r\nWerner, McNeal & Goodrich at the portage to prepare Geer and repar the\r\nwheels & Carrage against the arival of the Canoes and he also left 4\r\nhorses for the purpose of hauling the Canoes across. The Canoes arrived\r\non the 16th, and on the 26th they had all except one across, the Plains\r\nbecom So muddy from the emence rains which had fallen, that they Could\r\nnot get her over the portage. on the 28th they joined Capt Lewis at the\r\nGrog Spring a fiew miles above the enterance of Marias river From the\r\nFalls of Missouri Capt.

Jo. Fields Seeing this\r\nturned about to take his gun and Saw the fellow running off with his\r\nand his brothers, he called to his brother who instantly jumped up and\r\nprosued the indian with him whome they overtook at the distance of 50\r\nor 60 paces Siezed their guns and rested them from him and R.

I had Soon as I landed despatched Shabono to the\r\nMinetarras inviting the Chiefs to visit us, & Drewyer down to the lower\r\nVillage of the Mandans to ask Mr. Jessomme to Come and enterpret for\r\nus. Mr. Jessomme arived and I spoke to the chiefs of the Village\r\ninforming them that we Spoke to them as we had done when we were with\r\nthem last and we now repeeted our envitation to the principal Chiefs of\r\nall the Villages to accompany us and to the U States &c. &c. the Black\r\nCat Chief of the Mandans, Spoke and informed me that he wished to Visit\r\nthe United States and his Great Father but was afraid of the Scioux who\r\nwere yet at war with them and had killed Several of their men Since we\r\nhad left them, and were on the river below and would Certainly kill him\r\nif he attempted to go dow.i. I indeavered to do away with his\r\nobjections by informig him that we would not Suffer those indians to\r\nhurt any of our red Children who Should think proper to accompany us,\r\nand on their return they would be equally protected, and their presents\r\nwhich would be very liberal, with themselves, Conveyed to their own\r\nCountry at the expence of the U.

States and to hear his\r\nown Councils and receive his Gifts from his own hands as also See the\r\npopulation of a government which Can at their pleasure protect and\r\nSecur you from all your enimies, and chastize all those who will Shut\r\ntheir years to his Councils. we now offer to take you at the expense of\r\nour Government and Send you back to your Country again with a\r\nconsiderable present in merchendize which you will recive of your great\r\nFather. I urged the necessity of their going on with us as it would be\r\nthe means of hastening those Supples of Merchindize which would be Sent\r\nto their Country and exchanged as before mentioned for a moderate price\r\nin Pelteries and furs &c. the great Chief of the Menetaras Spoke, he\r\nSaid he wished to go down and See his great father very much, but that\r\nthe Scioux were in the road and would most certainly kill him or any\r\nothers who Should go down they were bad people and would not listen to\r\nany thing which was told them. when he Saw us last we told him that we\r\nhad made peace with all the nations below, Since that time the Seioux\r\nhad killed 8 of their people and Stole a number of their horses. he\r\nSaid that he had opened his ears and followed our Councils, he had made\r\npeace with the Chyennes and rocky mountains indians, and repieted the\r\nsame objecctions as mentioned. that he went to war against none and was\r\nwilling to receive all nations as friends. he Said that the Ricaras had\r\nStolen from his people a number of horses at different times and his\r\npeople had killed 2 Ricaras. if the Sieoux were at peace with them and\r\nCould be depended on he as also other Chiefs of the villages would be\r\nglad to go and See their great father, but as they were all afraid of\r\nthe Sieoux they Should not go down &c.\r\n\r\nThe Black Cat Chief of the Mandans Village on the North Side of the\r\nMissouri Sent over and requested me to go over to his village which\r\nenvertation I axceptd and crossed over to his village. he had a parcel\r\nof Corn about 12 bushuls in a pile in his lodge. he told me that his\r\npeople had but little corn part of which they had given me. after\r\ntakeing a Smoke he informed me that as the Sieoux were very troublesom\r\nand the road to his great father dangerous none of this village would\r\ngo down with us. I told the Cheifs and wariers of the village who were\r\nthere present that we were anxious that Some of the village Should go\r\nand See their great father and hear his good words & recve his\r\nbountifull gifts &c. and told them to pitch on Some Man on which they\r\ncould rely on and Send him to See their Great father, they made the\r\nSame objections which the Chief had done before. a young man offered to\r\ngo down, and they all agreeed for him to go down the charector of this\r\nyoung man I knew as a bad one and made an objection as to his age and\r\nChareckter at this time Gibson who was with me informed me that this\r\nyoung man had Stole his knife and had it then in his possession, this I\r\ninformed the Chief and directed him to give up the knife he delivered\r\nthe knife with a very faint apology for his haveing it in his\r\npossession. I then reproached those people for wishing to Send Such a\r\nman to See and hear the words of So great a man as their great father;\r\nthey hung their heads and Said nothing for Some time when the Cheif\r\nSpoke and Said that they were afraid to Send any one for fear of their\r\nbeing killed by the Sieux. after Smoking a pipe and relateing Some\r\npassages I recrossed to our Camp-. being informed by one of our\r\nenterpreters that the 2d Chief of the Mandans Comonly Called the little\r\nCrow intended to accompany us down, I took Charbono and walked to the\r\nVillage to See this Chief and talk with him on the Subject. he told me\r\nhe had deturmined to go down, but wished to have a council first with\r\nhis people which would be in the after part of the day. I smoked a pipe\r\nwith the little Crow and returned to the boat. Colter one of our men\r\nexpressed a desire to join Some trappers who offered to become Shearers\r\nwith and furnish traps &c. the offer a very advantagious one, to him,\r\nhis Services Could be dispenced with from this down and as we were\r\ndisposed to be of Service to any one of our party who had performed\r\ntheir duty as well as Colter had done, we agreed to allow him the\r\nprvilage provided no one of the party would ask or expect a Similar\r\npermission to which they all agreeed that they wished Colter every\r\nSuckcess and that as we did not wish any of them to Seperate untill we\r\nShould arive at St. Louis they would not apply or expect it &c.

I thanked the Chief for his kindness and informed him\r\nthat our Canoes would not Carry any more Corn than we had already\r\nbrought down. at 10 A. M the Chiefs of the different villages came to\r\nSee us and Smoke a pipe &c. as our Swivel Could no longer be\r\nServeceable to us as it could not be fireed on board the largest\r\nPerogue, we Concluded to make a present of it to the Great Chief of the\r\nMenetaras (the One Eye) with a view to ingratiate him more Strongly in\r\nour favour I had the Swivel Charged and Collected the Chiefs in a\r\ncircle around it and adressed them with great ceremoney. told them I\r\nhad listened with much attention to what the One Eye had Said yesterday\r\nand beleived that he was Sincere & Spoke from his heart. I reproached\r\nthem very Severely for not attending to what had been Said to them by\r\nus in Council in the fall of 1804 and at different times in the winter\r\nof 1804 & 5, and told them our backs were Scercely turned befor a party\r\nfollowed and killed the pore defenceless snake indians whom we had\r\ntaken by the hand & told them not to be afraid that you would never\r\nStrike them again &c. also mentioned the ricers &c. The little Cherry\r\nold Chief of the Menetarras Spoke as follows Viz: \"Father we wish to go\r\ndown with you to See our Great Father, but we know the nations below\r\nand are afraid of the Scioux who will be on the river and will kill us\r\non our return home. The Scioux has Stolen our horses and killed 8 of\r\nour men Since you left us, and the Ricaras have also Struck us. we\r\nStaid at home and listened to what you had told us. we at length went\r\nto war against the Scioux and met with Ricaras and killed two of them,\r\nthey were on their way to Strike us. We will attend to your word and\r\nnot hurt any people all Shall be Welcom and we Shall do as you\r\ndirect-.\" The One Eye Said his ears would always be open to the word of\r\nhis great father and Shut against bad Council &c. I then a good deel of\r\nCeremony made a preasent of the Swivel to the One Eye Chief and told\r\nhim when he fired this gun to remember the words of his great father\r\nwhich we had given him. this gun had anounced the words of his great\r\nfather to all the nations which we had Seen &c. &c. after the council\r\nwas over the gun was fired & delivered, they Chief appeared to be much\r\npleased and conveyed it immediately to his village &c. we Settled with\r\nand discharged Colter. in the evening I walked to the village to See\r\nthe little Crow and know when he would be ready, took with me a flag\r\nintending to give him to leave at his lodge but to my astonishment he\r\ninformed me he had declined going down the reason of which I found was\r\nthrough a jellousy between himself and the principal Chief he refused a\r\nflag & we Sent for Mr. Jessomme and told him to use his influn to\r\nprovail on one of the Chiefs to acompany us and we would employ him. he\r\ninformed us soon after that the big white Chief would go if we would\r\ntake his wife & Son & Jessoms wife & 2 children we wer obliged to agree\r\nto do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 17, 1806]\r\nSaturday 17th of August 1806\r\na Cool morning gave some powder & Ball to Big White Chief Settled with\r\nTouisant Chabono for his Services as an enterpreter the pric of a horse\r\nand Lodge purchased of him for public Service in all amounting to 500$\r\n33 1/3 cents. derected two of the largest of the Canoes be fastened\r\ntogether with poles tied across them So as to make them Study for the\r\npurpose of Conveying the Indians and enterpreter and their families\r\n\r\nwe were visited by all the principal Chiefs of the Menetarras to take\r\ntheir leave of us at 2 oClock we left our encampment after takeing\r\nleave of Colter who also Set out up the river in Company with Messrs.\r\nDickson & Handcock. we also took our leave of T. Chabono, his Snake\r\nIndian wife and their Son Child who had accompanied us on our rout to\r\nthe pacific Ocean in the Capacity of interpreter and interpretes. T.\r\nChabono wished much to accompany us in the Said Capacity if we could\r\nhave provailed the Menetarre Chiefs to dcend the river with us to the\r\nU. States, but as none of those chiefs of whoes language he was\r\nConversent would accompany us, his Services were no longer of use to\r\nthe U States and he was therefore discharged and paid up. we offered to\r\nconvey him down to the Illinois if he Chose to go, he declined\r\nproceeding on at present, observing that he had no acquaintance or\r\nprospects of makeing a liveing below, and must continue to live in the\r\nway that he had done. I offered to take his little Son a butifull\r\npromising Child who is 19 months old to which they both himself & wife\r\nwer willing provided the Child had been weened. they observed that in\r\none year the boy would be Sufficiently old to leave his mother & he\r\nwould then take him to me if I would be so freindly as to raise the\r\nChild for him in Such a manner as I thought proper, to which I agreeed\r\n&c.--we droped down to the Big white Cheifs Mandan Village 1/2 a mile\r\nbelow on the South Side, all the Indians proceeded on down by land. and\r\nI walked to the lodge of the Chief whome I found Sorounded by his\r\nfriends the men were Setting in a circle Smokeing and the womin Crying.\r\nhe Sent his bagage with his wife & Son, with the Interpreter Jessomme &\r\nhis wife and 2 children to the Canoes provided for them. after Smoking\r\none pipe, and distributing Some powder & lead which we had given him,\r\nhe informed me that he was ready and we were accompd to the Canoes by\r\nall the Village Maney of them Cried out aloud. as I was about to Shake\r\nwith the Grand Cheifs of all the Villages there assembled they\r\nrequested me to Set one minit longer with them which I readily agreed\r\nto and directed a pipe to be lit. the Cheifs informed that when we\r\nfirst came to their Country they did not beleive all we Said we then\r\ntold them. but they were now Convinced that every thing we had told\r\nthem were true, that they Should keep in memory every thing which we\r\nhad Said to them, and Strictly attend to our advice, that their young\r\nmen Should Stay at home and Should no go again to war against any\r\nnation, that if any atacted them they Should defend themselves, that we\r\nmight depend on what they Said, and requested us to inform their great\r\nfather. the also requested me to tell the Ricaras to Come and See them,\r\nnot to be afraid that no harm Should be done them, that they were\r\nanxious to be in peace with them.\r\n\r\nThe Seeoux they Said they had no dependance in and Should kill them\r\nwhenever they Came into their Country to do them harm &c. I told them\r\nthat we had always told them to defend themselves, but not to Strike\r\nthose nations we had taken by the hand, the Sieoux with whome they were\r\nat war we had never Seen on our return we Should inform their great\r\nfathe of their conduct towards his faithfull red Children and he would\r\ntake Such Steps as will bring about a lasting peace between them and\r\nhis faithfull red children.

I\r\nfurther informed them that the Mandans & Menetaras had opened their\r\nears to what we had Said to them but had Staid at home untill they were\r\nStruk that they were Still disposed to be friendly and on good terms\r\nwith the ricaras, they then Saw the great Chief of the Mandans by my\r\nSide who was on his way to see his great father, and was derected by\r\nhis nation & the Menetaras & Maharhas, to Smoke in the pipe of peace\r\nwith you and to tell you not to be afraid to go to their towns, or take\r\nthe Birds in the plains that their ears were open to our Councils and\r\nno harm Should be done to a Ricara.

That Several of the\r\nchiefs wished to accompany us down to See their great father, but\r\nwished to see the Chief who went down last Sumer return first, he\r\nexpressed Some apprehention as to the Safty of that Chiefs in passing\r\nthe Sieoux. that the Ricaras had every wish to be friendly with the\r\nMandans &c. that every mandan &c. who chose to visit the ricares should\r\nbe Safe that he Should Continue with his nation and See that they\r\nfollowed the Council which we had given them &c.--The Sun being very\r\nhot the Chyenne Chief envited us to his Lodge which was pitched in the\r\nplain at no great distance from the River. I accepted the invitation\r\nand accompanied him to his lodge which was new and much larger than any\r\nwhich I have Seen it was made of 20 dressed Buffalow Skins in the Same\r\nform of the Sceoux and lodges of other nations of this quarter. about\r\nthis lodges was 20 others Several of them of nearly the Same Size.

I told to them all that\r\nif they eve wished to be hapy that they must Shake off all intimecy\r\nwith the Seioux and unite themselves in a Strong allience and attend to\r\nwhat we had told them &c. which they promesed all to do and we Smoked\r\nand parted on the best terms, the Mandan Chief was Saluted by Several\r\nChiefs and brave men on his way with me to the river--I had requested\r\nthe ricaras & Chyennes to inform me as Soon as possible of their\r\nintentions of going down with us to See their great father or not. in\r\nthe evening the Great Chief requested that I would walk to his house\r\nwhich I did, he gave me about 2 quarts of Tobacco, 2 beaver Skins and a\r\ntrencher of boiled Corn & beans to eat (as it is the Custom of all the\r\nNations on the Missouri to give Something to every white man who enters\r\ntheir lodge Something to eat) this Chief informed me that none of his\r\nChiefs wished to go down with us they all wished to See the cheif who\r\nwent down return first, that the Chyennes were a wild people and were\r\nafraid to go. that they Should all listen to what I had Said. I gave\r\nhim Some ribon to Suspend his Medal to and a Shell which the Snake\r\nindians gave me for which he was very much pleased.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter informed me that the Cheifs of those villages had no\r\nintention of going down. one the Cheifs of the Village on the island\r\ntalkd. of going down.

The one arm 2d Cheif of this village whome we had\r\nexpected to accompany us down Spoke to the mandan Cheif in a loud and\r\nthretening tone which Caused me to be Some what alarmed for the Safty\r\nof that Cheif, I inform the Ricaras of this village that the Mandans\r\nhad opened their ears to and fold. our Councils, that this Cheif was on\r\nhis way to see their Great Father the P. of U S. and was under our\r\nprotection that if any enjorey was done to him by any nation that we\r\nShould all die to a man.

Since, that once been to See the\r\nmandans and they were going to kill him, they had not killed the\r\nMandans, it was the Seeoux who killed them and not the ricaras, he Said\r\nthat the Mandan Cheif was as Safe as if he was in his own Vilg that he\r\nhad opened his ears and Could here as well as the mandans. I then\r\ninformd them what I had told the upper villages and we all become\r\nperfectly reconsiled all to each other and Smoked in the most perfect\r\nharmony we had invatations to go into their lodges and eate.

I\r\nreturned the Canoes & derected the men to prepare to Set out. Some\r\nChyennes from two Lodges on the Main S E. Shore Came and Smoked with me\r\nand at 11 A. M we Set out haveing parted with those people who appeared\r\nto be Sorry to part with us. at this nation we found a french man by\r\nthe name of Rokey who was one of our Engagees as high as the Mandans\r\nthis man had Spend all his wages, and requested to return with uswe\r\nagreed to give him a passage down. I directed 2 guns to be fired. we\r\nproceeded on passed the Marapa and the We ter hoo Rivers, and landed to\r\ndry our bedding and robes &c which were all wet. here we delayed untill\r\n6 P M. and dryed our things which were much Spoiled.\r\n\r\nI derected 5 of the hunters to proceed on to Grouse Island a fiew miles\r\nbelow and hunt on that island untill we arived, we proceded on to the\r\nmain N E Shore below the Island and encamped, the hunters joined us\r\nwithout any thing. they Saw no game on the island. we made only 17\r\nMiles to day. below the ricaras the river widens and the Sand bars are\r\nemencely noumerous much less timber in the bottoms than above\r\n\r\nThe Chyenne's are portly Indians much the complections of the Mandans &\r\nricaras high Cheeks, Streight limbed & high noses the men are large,\r\ntheir dress in Sumner is Simpelly a roab of a light buffalow Skin with\r\nor without the hair and a Breach clout & mockerson Some ware leagins\r\nand mockersons, their ornaments are but fiew and those are composed\r\nprincipally of Such articles as they precure from other indians Such as\r\nblue beeds, Shell, red paint rings of brass broaches &c. they also ware\r\nBears Claws about their necks, Strips of otter Skin (which they as well\r\nas the ricaras are excessively fond of) around their neck falling back\r\nbehind. their ears are cut at the lower part, but fiew of them were\r\nornements in them, their hair is generally Cut in the forehead above\r\ntheir eyes and Small ornimented plats in front of each Sholder the\r\nremainder of the hair is either twisted in with horse or buffalow hair\r\ndivided into two plats over the Sholder or what is most common flow's\r\nback, Their women are homely, corse feetured wide mouthes they ware\r\nSimpially a leathe habit made in a plain form of two pieces of equal\r\nlength and equal weadth, which is sewen together with Sinues from the\r\ntail to about half way from the hip to the arm, a String fastens the 2\r\npieces together over the Sholders leaveng a flap or lapells which fall\r\nover near half way ther body both before and behind. those dresses\r\nusially fall as low as mid leg, they are frequently ornemented with\r\nbeeds and Shells & Elk tuskes of which all Indians are very fond of.\r\nthose dresses are als frequently Printed in various regular figures\r\nwith hot sticks which are rubed on the leather with Such velosity as to\r\nnearly burn it this is very handsom. they were their hair flowing and\r\nare excessively fond of ornamenting their ears with blue beeds--this\r\nnation peacbly disposed they may be estimated at from 350 to 400 men\r\ninhabetig from 130 to 150 Lodges, they are rich in horses & Dogs, the\r\ndogs Carry a great preportion of their light baggage. they Confess to\r\nbe at war with no nation except the Sieoux with whome they have ever\r\nsince their remembranc been on a difencive war, with the Bands of\r\nSieoux. as I was about to leave the Cheifs of the Chyennes lodge he\r\nrequested me to Send Some traders to them, that their country was full\r\nof beaver and they would then be encouraged to Kill beaver, but now\r\nthey had no use for them as they could get nothing for their skins and\r\ndid not know well, how to catch beaver. if the white people would come\r\namongst them they would become acquainted and the white people would\r\nlearn them how to take the beaver-. I promised the Nation that I would\r\ninform their Great father the President of the U States, and he would\r\nhave them Supplied with goods, and mentioned in what manner they would\r\nbe Supplied &c. &c.\r\n\r\nI am happy to have it in my power to Say that my worthy friend Capt\r\nLewis is recovering fast, he walked a little to day for the first time.\r\nI have discontinud the tent in the hole the ball came out\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned that the Mandans Maharhas Menetarras &\r\nRicarras, keep their horses in the Lodge with themselves at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 23, 1806]\r\nSaturday 23rd August 1806\r\nWe Set out very early, the wind rose & became very hard, we passed the\r\nSar-war-kar-na-har river at 10 A.

Sent out a hunter he Saw Several deer they were very wild and he\r\nreturned without haveing killed any, the deer on this pt. of the\r\nMissouri is mostly the Mule or black tail Species. we Saw only 6\r\nbuffalow to day the Sieoux have been laterly encamped on the river and\r\nhave Secured the most of the game opp. a large trail has passed on a\r\nderection to the enterance of the Chyenne this probably is the trail of\r\na war party. at 5 P.M. we proceeded on a fiew miles and Encampd. on the\r\ngouge of the lookout bend of 20 miles around and 3/4 through, a little\r\nabove an old tradeing house and 4 miles above of our outward bound\r\nencampment of the 1st of October 1804, haveing made 43 miles to day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 25, 1806]\r\nMonday 25th August 1806\r\na cool clear morning a Stiff breeze ahead we Set out at the usial hour\r\nand proceeded on very well. I derected Shields Collins Shannon and the\r\ntwo fieldses to proceed on in the two small Canoes to the Ponia Island\r\nand hunt on that Island untill we came on, they Set out before day\r\nlight The Skirt of timber in the bend above the Chyenne is not very\r\nConsiderable the timber is Scattered from 4 to 16 miles on the S W Side\r\nof the river, and the thickest part is at the distance of 6 & 10 miles\r\nfrom the Chyenne, a narrow bottom of Small Cotton trees is also on the\r\nN E pt. at the distance of from 4 to 41/2 miles above the Chyenne\r\nimediately at the enterance of that river I observe but fiew large\r\ntrees Some Small Growth and willows on the lower Side bottom on the\r\nMissouri about 1/2 a mile and extends up the Chyen 1 mile about a\r\nquarter of a mile above is a 2d bottom of Cotton timber, in the point\r\nabove the Chyenne there is a considerable bottom of about 2 miles on\r\nthat river and a large timbered bottom a Short distance above. at 8\r\nA.M. we Came to at the mouth of the Chyenne to delay untill 12 to make\r\na meridian observation and derected 3 hunters to proced up this river\r\nand hunt its bottoms untill twelve at which hou we Shall proceed on.\r\nthe hunters returned with 2 deer the Chyenne discharges but little\r\nwater which is much the colour of the missouri tho not So muddy I\r\nobserve a very eligable Situation on the bank of the Chyenne on it's\r\nlower Side about 100 paces from it's enterance. this Situation is above\r\nthe high floods and has a perfect Command of each river we obtained a\r\nMeridian altitude with the Sextt. and artificial Horizon 112° 50' 00\"-\r\nafter which we proceeded on passed the pania Island and came up with\r\nShields and Collins they had killed two deer only at 3 P M we passed\r\nthe place where we Saw the last encampement of Troubleson Tetons below\r\nthe old ponia village on the S W Side. a very large timbered bottom on\r\nthe N. E. Side imedialely below the Pania Island. Latd. of Chyenne is\r\n____ North. at Sunset we landed about the Center of a large bottom on\r\nthe N E Side a little below the enterance of No timber Creek and below\r\nour Encampment of 29th of Septr. 1804. dreyer killed a deer after we\r\nencamped. a little above our encampmt. the ricaras had formerly a large\r\nvillage on each Side which was destroyed by the Seioux. there is the\r\nremains of 5 other villages on the S W. Side below the Chyenne river\r\nand one on Le ho catts Isld. all those villages have been broken up by\r\nthe Seioux. This day proved a fine Still day and the men played their\r\noars and we made 48 miles to day. The 2 fields and Shannon did not join\r\nthis evening which caused me to encamp earlier than usial for them. we\r\nSaw no game on the plains today. the Tetons have been on the river not\r\nlong Since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 26, 1806]\r\nTuesday 26th of August 1806\r\na heavy dew this morning the hunters or Shannon & the 2 fields came up\r\nat Sunrise and we Set out, they had killed only 2 Small deer one of\r\nwhich they had eat at 8 passed the place the Tetons were encamped at\r\nthe time they attempted to Stop us in Septr. 1804, and at 9 A.M. passed\r\nthe enterance of Teton River. Saw Several black tail or Mule deer and\r\nSent out to kill them but they were wild and the hunters Could not get\r\na Shot at either of them. a fiew miles below the Teton river I observed\r\na buffalow Skin Canoe lying on the S Shore and a Short distance lower a\r\nraft which induces me to Suspect that the Tetons are not on the\r\nMissouri at the big bend as we were informed by the Ricaras, but up the\r\nTeton river. at Meridn. we halted on the N E. Side opposit a handsom\r\nleavel plain in which there is great quantities of plumbs which are not\r\nyet ripe. we passed the enteranc of Smoke Creek and landed and\r\nContinued two hours to Stop a leak in the perogue and fix the Stearing\r\noare, Saw great quantities of Grapes, they are black tho not thurerly\r\nripe. at 5 P M. we landed a Louisells fort on Ceder Island, this fort\r\nis entire and every part appears to be in the Same state it was when we\r\npassed it in Septr. 1804. I observed the appearance of 3 fires in the\r\nhouses which appeared to have been made 10 or 12 days past. we\r\nproceeded on about 10 miles lower and encamped on the S. W. Side\r\nopposit our outward bound encampment of the 21st of Septr. 1804, a fiew\r\nmiles above Tylors River. we had a Stiff breeze from the S. E. which\r\ncontinued to blow the greater part of the night dry and pleasent. as we\r\nwere now in the Country where we were informed the Sceoux were\r\nassembled we were much on our guard deturmined to put up with no\r\ninsults from those bands of Seioux, all the arms &. in perfect order.\r\nCapt.

I have\r\ndiscontinued the tent in the hole where the ball entered, agreeable to\r\nhis request. he tells me that he is fully Convinced that the wound is\r\nsufficiently heeled for the tents to be discontinued. we made 60 miles\r\nto day with the wind ahead greater part of the day-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 27, 1806]\r\nWednesday 27th Augt. 1806\r\nSet out before Sunrise a Stiff breeze a head from the East proceeded to\r\nthe enterance of Tylors river on the S W Side and landed on a Sand bar\r\nand Sent out the hunters to kill Some meat, our Stock of meat being now\r\nexousted and this the most favourable place to precure a fresh Supply,\r\nthe hunters returned in 3 hours without haveing killed any thing. they\r\ninformed me that the bottoms were entirely beaten up and the grass laid\r\nflat by the emence number of Buffalow which had been here a Short time\r\npast. the deer had left the bottom. they Saw several Buffalow Bulls\r\nwhich they did not think proper to kill as they were unfit for use.\r\nhere we discover the first Signs of the wild turkey. at 1 P M we halted\r\nin the big bend and killed a fat buck elk near the river, which was\r\nvery timely as our meat was entirely exhosted. at 2 P. M we again\r\nproceeded on down saw Several Buffalow Bulls on each Side of the river\r\nalso Some deer of the Common kind at 6 P.M. we herd the bellowing of\r\nthe Buffalow Bulls in the lower Isld. of the Big bend below the Gouge\r\nwhich induced a belief that there was Some fat Cows, 5 men went out\r\nfrom the 2 Small Canoes which was a little a head, and killed two Cows\r\none Bull and a Calf nether of them wer fat we droped the Perogue &\r\nCanoes to the lower part of the Island near to where the buffalow was\r\nkilled and incamped haveing Come 45 Miles only to day. had the buffalow\r\nbutched and brought in and divided. My friend Capt Lewis hurt himself\r\nvery much by takeing a longer walk on the Sand bar in my absence at the\r\nbuffalow than he had Strength to undergo, which Caused him to remain\r\nvery unwell all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, August 28, 1806]\r\nThursday 28th of August 1806\r\nCapt Lewis had a bad nights rest and is not very well this morning. we\r\nSet out early and proceded on very well, Saw a number of Buffalow bulls\r\non the banks in different places. passd the 3 rivers of the Seioux pass\r\nat 9 A.M. a Short distance below on the S W Side Sent out Reubin &\r\nJoseph Feild to hunt for the Mule deer or the antilope neither of which\r\nwe have either the Skins or Scellitens of, we detected those two men to\r\nproceed on down to the places we encamped the 16th & 17th of Septr.\r\n1804 and which place the party had called pleasant Camp from the great\r\nabundance of Game Such as Buffalow Elk, antilopes, Blacktail or mule\r\ndeer, fallow deer, common deer wolves barking Squirels, Turkies and a\r\nvariety of other animals, aded to which there was a great abundance of\r\nthe most delicious plumbs and grapes. this Situation which is a Short\r\ndistance above the enterance of Corvus Creek we are deturmined to delay\r\none day for the purpose of prcureing the sceletins of the Mule deer &\r\nantilope, and Some barking Squirels. a fiew miles below the place the 2\r\nFields were Set on Shore we Set Drewyer and Labeech on Shore with the\r\nSame directions which had been given to the 2 field's at 12 oClock we\r\nLanded on the S W.

I\r\nhave observed that in the country between the nations which are at war\r\nwith each other the greatest numbers of wild animals are to be found-\r\non my return to the river I killed 2 young deer. after Dinner we\r\nproceeded down the river about 3 mile to the Camp of Jo. & Rubin fields\r\nand Collins, and encamped on the S W.

Fields & Shannon to\r\ncontinue on the point of a Sand bar untill he corns up. I took 3\r\nhunters and walked on the N E Shore with a view to kill Some fat meet.\r\nwe had not proceeded far before Saw a large plumb orchd of the most\r\ndeelicious plumbs, out of this orchard 2 large Buck Elks ran the\r\nhunters killed them. I Stoped the Canoes and brought in the flesh which\r\nwas fat and fine. here the party Collected as many plumbs as they could\r\neate and Several pecks of which they put by &c. after a delay of nearly\r\n2 hours we again proceeded on downwards passed 3 Small Islands and as\r\nwe were about to land at the place appointed to wait for the 2 fields\r\nand Shannon, I saw Several men on horseback which with the help of a\r\nSpie glass I found to be Indians on the high hills to the N E we landed\r\non the S. W. Side and I sent out two men to a village of Barking\r\nSquirels to kill Some of those animals imedeatily after landing about\r\n20 indians was discovered on an eminanc a little above us on the\r\nopposite Side. one of those men I took to be a freinch man from his a\r\nblanket Capoe & a handkerchief around his head. imediately after 80 or\r\n90 Indian men all armed with fusees & Bows & arrows Came out of a wood\r\non the opposite bank about 1/4 of a mile below us. they fired of their\r\nguns as a Salute we returned the Salute with 2 rounds. we were at a\r\nloss to deturmin of what nation those indians were. from their hostile\r\nappearance we were apprehensive they were Tetons. but from the Country\r\nthrough which they roved we were willing to believe them eithe the\r\nYanktons, Ponars or Mahars either of which nations are well disposed\r\ntowards the white people. I deturmined to find out who they were\r\nwithout running any resque of the party and indians, and therefore took\r\nthree french men who could Speak the Mahar Pania and some Seioux and in\r\na Small canoe I went over to a Sand bar which extended Sufficently near\r\nthe opposite Shore to Converse. imedeately after I Set out 3 young men\r\nSet out from the opposite Side and Swam next me on the Sand bar. I\r\nderected the men to Speak to them in the Pania and mahar Languages\r\nfirst neither of which they could understand I then derected the man\r\nwho could Speak a fiew words of Seioux to inquire what nation or tribe\r\nthey belong to they informed me that they were Tetons and their Chief\r\nwas Tar-tack-kah-sabbar or the black buffalow This Chief I knew very\r\nwell to be the one we had seen with his band at Teton river which band\r\nhad attempted to detain us in the fall of 1804 as we assended this\r\nriver and with whome we wer near comeing to blows. I told those Indians\r\nthat they had been deef to our councils and ill treated us as we\r\nassended this river two years past, that they had abused all the whites\r\nwho had visited them since. I believed them to be bad people & Should\r\nnot Suffer them to cross to the Side on which the party lay, and\r\ndirected them to return with their band to their Camp, that if any of\r\nthem come near our camp we Should kill them certainly. I lef them on\r\nthe bear and returned to th party and examined the arms &c. those\r\nindians seeing Some Corn in the Canoe requested Some of it which I\r\nrefused being deturmined to have nothing to do with those people.\r\nSeveral others Swam across one of which understood pania, and as our\r\npania interpreter was a very good one we had it in our power to inform\r\nwhat we wished. I told this man to inform his nation that we had not\r\nforgot their treatment to us as we passed up this river &c. that they\r\nhad treated all the white people who had visited them very badly; robed\r\nthem of their goods, and had wounded one man whome I had Seen. we\r\nviewed them as bad people and no more traders would be Suffered to come\r\nto them, and whenever the white people wished to visit the nations\r\nabove they would Come Sufficiently Strong to whip any vilenous party\r\nwho dare to oppose them and words to the Same purpote. I also told them\r\nthat I was informed that a part of all their bands were gorn to war\r\nagainst the Mandans &c, and that they would be well whiped as the\r\nMandans & Menetarres & had a plenty of Guns Powder and ball, and we had\r\ngiven them a Cannon to defend themselves. and derected them to return\r\nfrom the Sand bar and inform their Chiefs what we had Said to them, and\r\nto keep away from the river or we Should kill every one of them &c. &c.\r\nthose fellows requested to be allowed to Come across and make Cumerads\r\nwhich we positively refused and I directed them to return imediately\r\nwhich they did and after they had informed the Chiefs &c. as I Suppose\r\nwhat we had Said to them, they all Set out on their return to their\r\nCamps back of a high hill. 7 of them halted on the top of the hill and\r\nblackguarded us, told us to come across and they would kill us all &c.\r\nof which we took no notice. we all this time were extreamly anxious for\r\nthe arival of the 2 fields & Shannon whome we had left behind, and were\r\nSome what consd. as to their Safty. to our great joy those men hove in\r\nSight at 6 P.M.

Saw Several Indians on\r\nthe hills at a distance this evening viewing us. our encampment of this\r\nevening was a very disagreable one, bleak exposed to the winds, and the\r\nSand wet. I pitched on this Situation to prevent being disturbed by\r\nthose Scioux in the Course of the night as well as to avoid the\r\nMusquetors-.

Jo. Fields and\r\nShannon landed on an Ponceras Island to try to kill Some deer which was\r\nSeen on the beech and the Canoes all passed them at 9 A. M we passed\r\nthe enterance of River Quiequur which had the Same appearance it had\r\nwhen we passed up water rapid and of a milky white Colour about two\r\nmiles below the Quicurre, 9 Indians ran down the bank and beckened to\r\nus to land, they appeared to be a war party, and I took them to be\r\nTetons and paid no kind of attention to them further than an enquirey\r\nto what tribe they belonged, they did not give me any answer, I prosume\r\nthey did not understand the man who Spoke to them as he Spoke but\r\nlittle of their language. as one Canoe was yet behind we landed in an\r\nopen Commanding Situation out of Sight of the indians deturmined to\r\ndelay untill they Came up. about 15 minits after we had landed Several\r\nguns were fired by the indians, which we expected was at the three men\r\nbehind. I calld out 15 men and ran up with a fill deturmination to\r\nCover them if possible let the number of the indians be what they\r\nmight. Capt Lewis hobled up on the bank and formed the remainder of the\r\nparty in a Situation well calculated to defend themselves and the\r\nCanoes &c. when I had proceeded to the point about 250 yards I\r\ndiscovered the Canoe about 1 mile above & the indians where we had left\r\nthem. I then walked on the Sand beech and the indians came down to meet\r\nme I gave them my hand and enquired of them what they were Shooting at,\r\nthey informed me that they were Shooting off their guns at an old Keg\r\nwhich we had thrown out of one of the Canoes and was floating down.\r\nthose Indians informed me they were Yanktons, one of the men with me\r\nknew one of the Indians to be the brother of young Durion's wife.\r\nfinding those indians to be Yanktons I invited them down to the boats\r\nto Smoke. when we arived at the Canoes they all eagerly Saluted the\r\nMandan Chief, and we all Set and Smoked Several pipes. I told them that\r\nwe took them to be a party of Tetons and the fireing I expected was at\r\nthe three men in the rear Canoe and I had went up with a full intention\r\nto kill them all if they had been tetons & fired on the Canoe as we\r\nfirst expected, but finding them Yanktons and good men we were glad to\r\nSee them and take them by the hand as faithfull Children who had opened\r\ntheir ears to our Councils. one of them Spoke and Said that their\r\nnation had opened their years, & done as we had directed them ever\r\nSince we gave the Meadel to their great Chief, and Should Continue to\r\ndo as we had told them we enquired if any of their Chiefs had gone down\r\nwith Mr. Durion, the answered that their great Chief and many of their\r\nbrave men had gone down, that the white people had built a house near\r\nthe Mahar village where they traded. we tied a piec of ribon to each\r\nmans hair and gave them Some Corn of which they appeared much pleased.\r\nThe Mandan Cheif gave a par of elegant Legins to the principal man of\r\nthe indian party, which is an indian fashion. the Canoe & 3 men haveing\r\njoined us we took our leave of this party telling them to return to\r\ntheir band and listen to our councils which we had before given to\r\nthem. Their band of 80 Lodges were on plum Creek a fiew miles to north.\r\nthose nine men had five fusees and 4 bows & quivers of arrows. at 2\r\nP.M. we came too on the upper point of bon homme opposit the antient\r\nfortification and Sent out men to hunt on each Side and on the island.\r\nand the canoes on each Side of the island to receive any meat might be\r\nkilled I walked on the N.

Labeech killed an Elk only the flesh of which was brought on\r\nin the perogue. at this island we brought 2 years together or on the\r\n1st of Septr. 1804 we Encamped at the lower point of this Island. after\r\nwe all Came together we again proceeded on down to a large Sand bar\r\nimediately opposit to the place were we met the Yanktons in Council at\r\nthe Calumet Bluffs and which place we left on the it of Septr. 1804. I\r\nobserved our old flag Staff or pole Standing as we left it. the\r\nmusquitors excessively troublesom untill about 10 P.M. when the S W\r\nwind became Strong and blew the most of them off. we came 52 miles to\r\nday only with a head wind. the Country on either Side are butifull and\r\nthe plains much richer below the Queiquer river than above that river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, September 2, 1806]\r\nTuesday 2nd of September 1806\r\nSet out at the usial hour passed the River Jacque at 8 A.M. in the\r\nfirst bottom below on the N E.

E untill 3 P. M\r\nI saw in my walk to day Lynn and Slipery Elm. the plains are tolerably\r\nleavel on each Side and very fertile. I saw 4 prarie fowls Common to\r\nthe Illinois, those are the highest up which have been Seen, white Oak\r\nis very Common also white ash on the riveens and high bottoms. two\r\nturkys killed to day of which the Indians very much admired being the\r\nfirst which they ever Saw.

Side at 11 A M. and at half past 4 P. M\r\nwe Spied two boats & Several men, our party peyed their Ores and we\r\nSoon landed on the Side of the Boats the men of these boats Saluted us\r\nwith their Small arms I landed & was met by a Mr. James Airs from\r\nMackanaw by way of Prarie Dechien and St. Louis. this Gentleman is of\r\nthe house of Dickson & Co. of Prarie de Chian who has a Licence to\r\ntrade for one year with the Sieoux he has 2 Batteaux loaded with\r\nMerchendize for that purpose. This Gentleman receved both Capt.

I set up late and partook of the\r\ntent of Mr. Aires which was dry. Mr. Aires unfortunately had his boat\r\nSunk on the 25 of July last by a violent Storm of Wind and hail by\r\nwhich accident he lost the most of his usefull articles as he informd.\r\nus. this Gentleman informed us of maney Changes & misfortunes which had\r\ntaken place in the Illinois amongst others the loss of Mr. Cady\r\nChoteaus house and furniture by fire. for this misfortune of our friend\r\nChoteaus I feel my Self very much Concernd &c. he also informed us that\r\nGenl.

I am happy\r\nto find that my worthy friend Capt L's is so well as to walk about with\r\nease to himself &c., we made 60 Miles to day the river much crowded\r\nwith Sand bars, which are very differently Situated from what they were\r\nwhen we went up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, September 4, 1806]\r\nThursday 4th September 1806\r\nThe Musquitors became troublesom early this morning I rose at the usial\r\nhour found all the party as wet as rain could make them. as we were in\r\nwant of Some tobacco I purposed to Mr. Airs to furnish us with 4\r\nCarrots for which we would Pay the amount to any Merchant of St. Louis\r\nhe very readily agreed to furnish us with tobacco and gave to each man\r\nas much as it is necessary for them to use between this and St. Louis,\r\nan instance of Generossity for which every man of the party appears to\r\nacknowledge. Mr. Airs also insisted on our accepting a barrel of\r\nflourwe gave to this gentleman what Corn we Could Spear amounting to\r\nabout 6 bushels, this Corn was well Calculated for his purpose as he\r\nwas about to make his establishment and would have it in his power to\r\nhull the Corn & The flower was very acceptable to us. we have yet a\r\nlittle flour part of what we carried up from the Illinois as high as\r\nMaria's river and buried it there untill our return &c. at 8 A. M we\r\ntook our leave and Set out, and proceeded on very well, at 11 A.M.\r\npassed the Enterance of the big Sieoux River which is low, and at\r\nmeridian we came too at Floyds Bluff below the Enterance of Floyds\r\nriver and assended the hill, with Capt Lewis and Several men, found the\r\ngrave had been opened by the nativs and left half Covered. we had this\r\ngrave Completely filled up, and returned to the Canoes and proceeded on\r\nto the Sand bar on which we encamped from the 12th to the 20th of\r\nAugust 1804 near the Mahar Village, here we came to and derected every\r\nwet article put out to dry, all the bedding of the party and Skins\r\nbeing wet. as it was late in the evening we deturmined to continue all\r\nnight. had issued to each man of the party a cup of flour. we See no\r\nSpecies of Game on the river as usial except wild geese and pelicans. I\r\nobserved near Sergt Floyds Grave a number of flurishing black walnut\r\ntrees, these are the first which I have seen decending the river. a\r\nlittle before night Several Guns were heard below and in a direction\r\ntowards the Mahar village which induced us to suspect that Mr.\r\nMcClellin who we was informed was on his way up to trade with the\r\nMahars had arived at the Creek below and that those reports of Guns was\r\nSome of his party out hunting. every thing being dry we derected the\r\nPerogue & Canoes to be loaded and in readiness to Set out in the\r\nmorning early. at dark the Musquetors became troublesom and continued\r\nSo all night the party obtained but little Sleep--we made 36 miles only\r\nto daye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Clark, September 5, 1806]\r\nFriday 5th September 1806\r\nThe Musquetors being So excessively tormenting that the party was all\r\non board and we Set out at day light and proceeded on very well. here\r\nthe river is bordered on both sides with timber &c becoms much narrower\r\nmore Crooked and the Current more rapid and Crouded with Snags or\r\nSawyers than it is above, and continus So all day. We did not meet with\r\nMcClellen as we expected at the Creek. the report of the guns which was\r\nheard must have been the Mahars who most probably have just arrived at\r\ntheir village from hunting the buffalow. this is a Season they usialy\r\nreturn to their village to Secure their Crops of Corn Beens punkins &c\r\n&c. proceeded on very well passd. the blue Stone bluff at 3 P.

Capt. McClellin informed us that he was\r\non reather a speculative expedition to the confines of New Spain, with\r\nthe view to entroduce a trade with those people. his plan is to\r\nproceede up this river to the Entcrance of the river platt there to\r\nform an establishment from which to trade partially with the Panas &\r\nOttoes, to form an acquaintance with the Panias and provail Some of\r\ntheir principal Chiefs to accompany him to Santa Fee where he will\r\nappear in a stile calculated to atract the Spanish government in that\r\nquarter and through the influence of a handsome present he expects to\r\nbe promited to exchange his merchindize for Silver & gold of which\r\nthose people abound. he has a kind of introductory Speach from Govr.\r\nWilkinson to the Panias and Ottoes and a quantity of presents of his\r\nown which he purposes distributing to the Panias and ELeatans with a\r\nview to gain their protection in the execution of his plans, if the\r\nSpanish Governmt. favour his plans, he purposes takeing his merchendize\r\non mules & horses which Can easily be procured of the panias, to Some\r\npoint convenient to the Spanish Settlements within the Louisiana\r\nTeritory to which place the inhabitants of New mexico may meet him for\r\nthe purpose of trade &c.
