Wylie, in his invaluable Notes on Chinese Literature, says, “Works\r\nof fiction par excellence are not admitted by the Chinese to form a\r\npart of their national literature. Those who have imbibed European\r\nideas on the subject, however, will feel that the novels and romances\r\nare too important as a class to be overlooked. The insight they give in\r\nthe national manners and customs of various ages, the specimens which\r\nthey furnish of an ever-changing language, the fact of this being the\r\nonly channel through which a large portion of the people gain their\r\nknowledge of history, and the influence which they must consequently\r\nexercise in the formation of character, are reasons too weighty to be\r\nleft out of account, notwithstanding the prejudices of scholars on the\r\nsubject. Foremost among these in popular estimation is the San Kuo Chih\r\nYen-i (三國志演義). This is a historical novel, in 120 chapters, written by\r\nLo Kuan-chung (羅貫中) of the Yüan dynasty (1260–1341). The plot, which is\r\nfounded on the historical events immediately succeeding the decadence\r\nof the house of Han, is wrought out with a most elaborate complication\r\nof details, embracing the period from 168 to 265. Following the course\r\nof events from the imbecile reign of Ling Ti of the Han, the tale opens\r\nwith an account of the insurrection of the ‘Yellow Caps,’ during which\r\nLiu Pei (劉備), a descendant of the imperial family, enters into a solemn\r\ncompact with Kuan Yü (關羽), now the deified Kuan Ti, God of War, and\r\nChang Fei (張飛) to aid each other till death, in their efforts to uphold\r\nthe falling house. The fortunes of Liu Pei are traced through a series\r\nof reverses, till he assumes the royal power, (known afterwards as\r\nChao-Lieh Ti), and the empire became divided into three states Wei, Shu\r\nand Wu. Tyranny and bloodshed mark the narrative for nearly a century,\r\ntill the usurper Tsʻao Mao of the Wei is deposed by his minister Ssŭ-ma\r\nChao, whose son became the consolidator of the empire, and founder of\r\nthe Tsin dynasty, being the Wu Ti of history.”\r\n\r\nAs a general description of the book, Wylie’s brief note leaves little\r\nto be desired; to amplify it would mean an analysis with which I would\r\nnot weary the reader. I will add, however, that the San Kuo is widely\r\nread and very generally known, perhaps, however, better through stage\r\nperformances than by actual reading.\r\n\r\nThe San Kuo is distinctly eastern, a book adapted for the story-teller;\r\none can almost hear him. It abounds in names and genealogies, which\r\nseem never to tire the eastern reader or listener. Happily, English\r\nadmits pronouns in place of so many strangely-spelt names which ought\r\nto appear, and they have been used; and as most persons have at least a\r\ntzŭ in addition to the hsing and ming I have tried to lighten the\r\nburden on the foreign reader’s memory by using only the hsing or hsing\r\nand ming of a man, suppressing his tzŭ except in the case of very\r\nwell-known characters.\r\n\r\nManchu, Japanese, Siamese, and possibly other versions of the San Kuo\r\nhave been made, and now to these I have attempted to add one in\r\nEnglish, with what measure of success I leave to curious readers\r\nqualified to compare my rendering with the original.\r\n\r\nThe Wade system of romanisation, in which the vowels are Italian, has\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to put on record my gratitude to Mr. Chen Ti Tsen\r\nwho typed the text, and Mr. E. Manico Gull who has read the proofs.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. H. B.-T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFEAST IN THE GARDEN OF PEACHES: BROTHERHOOD SWORN:\r\nSLAUGHTER OF REBELS: THE BROTHERS HEROES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmpires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce. When the rule\r\nof Chou weakened seven contending principalities sprang up, warring one\r\nwith another till they settled down as Tsʻin and when its destiny had\r\nbeen fulfilled arose Chʻu and Han to contend for the mastery. And Han\r\nwas the victor.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the fortunes of Han began with the slaughter of the White\r\nSerpent. In a short time the whole Empire was theirs and their\r\nmagnificent heritage was handed down in successive generations till the\r\ndays of Kuang-Wu, whose name stands in the middle of the long line of\r\nHan. This was in the first century of the western era and the dynasty\r\nhad then already passed its zenith. A century later came to the Throne\r\nthe Emperor Hsien, doomed to see the beginning of the division into\r\nthree parts, known to history as The Three Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe descent into misrule hastened in the reigns of the two Emperors\r\nHuan and Ling, who sat in the dragon seat about the middle of the\r\nsecond century. The former of these two paid no heed to the good men of\r\nhis court, but gave his confidence to the palace eunuchs. He lived and\r\ndied, leaving the sceptre to Ling, whose trusted advisers were the\r\nGeneral Tou Wu and the Grand Tutor Chʻên Fan. These two, disgusted with\r\nthe abuses resulting from the meddling of the eunuchs in affairs of\r\nState, plotted their destruction. But the chief eunuch Tsʻao Chieh was\r\nnot to be disposed of easily. The plot leaked out and the two honest\r\nmen fell, leaving the eunuchs stronger than before.\r\n\r\nIt fell upon the day of full moon of the fourth month, second year of\r\nthe period Chien-Ning, that the Emperor went in state to the Wên-tê\r\nHall. As he drew near the Throne a rushing whirlwind arose in the\r\ncorner of the hall and, lo! from the roof beams floated down a\r\nmonstrous black serpent that coiled itself up on the very seat of\r\nmajesty. The Emperor fell in a swoon. Those nearest him hastily raised\r\nand bore him to his palace while the courtiers scattered and fled. The\r\nserpent disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut there followed a terrific tempest, thunder, hail and torrents of\r\nrain, lasting till midnight and working havoc on all sides. Two years\r\nlater the earth quaked in Loyang, while along the coast a huge tidal\r\nwave rushed in which, in its recoil, swept away all the dwellers by the\r\nsea. Another evil omen was recorded ten years later, when the\r\nreign-title was changed: certain hens suddenly developed male\r\ncharacteristics, a miracle which could only refer to the effeminate\r\neunuchs meddling in affairs of State. At the new moon of the sixth\r\nmonth a long wreath of black vapour wound its way into the audience\r\nchamber, while in the following month a rainbow was seen in the Jade\r\nChamber. Away from the capital a mountain fell in, leaving a mighty\r\nrift in its flank.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of various omens. The Emperor, greatly moved by these\r\nsigns of the displeasure of Heaven, issued an edict asking his\r\nministers for an explanation of the calamities and marvels. A certain\r\nTsʻai Yung replied bluntly that showers of insects and changes of\r\nfowls’ sexes were brought about by feminine interference in State\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor read this memorial with deep sighs, and the chief eunuch\r\nTsʻao Chieh, from his place behind the Throne, anxiously noted these\r\nsigns of grief. An opportunity offering, he read the document and told\r\nhis fellows its purport. Before long a charge was trumped up against\r\nthe author, who was driven from court and forced to retire to his\r\ncountry house. With this victory the eunuchs grew bolder. Ten of them,\r\nrivals in wickedness and associates in evil deeds, formed a powerful\r\nparty known as The Ten. One of them, Chang Jang, won such influence\r\nthat he became the Emperor’s most honoured and trusted adviser. The\r\nEmperor even called him Daddie. So the Government went quickly from bad\r\nto worse, till the country was ripe for rebellion and buzzed with\r\nbrigandage.\r\n\r\nAt this time in Chülu was a certain Chang family, of whom three\r\nbrothers bore the name of Chio, Pao and Liang respectively. The eldest\r\nwas an unclassed graduate, who devoted himself to medicine. One day,\r\nwhile culling simples in the woods, he met a venerable old gentleman\r\nwith very bright eyes and fresh complexion, who walked leaning on a\r\nstaff. The old man beckoned Chio into a cave and there gave him three\r\nvolumes of the “Book of Heaven.” “This book” said he, “is the Way of\r\nPeace. With the aid of these volumes you can convert the world and\r\nrescue mankind. But you must be single-minded, or, rest assured, you\r\nwill greatly suffer.”\r\n\r\nWith a humble obeisance Chang took the book and asked the name of his\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\n“I am the Hsien of the Southern Land of Glory,” was the reply, as the\r\nold gentleman disappeared in thin air.\r\n\r\nThe new possessor of the wonderful book studied it eagerly and strove\r\nday and night to reduce its precepts to practice. Before long he could\r\nsummon the winds and command the rain, and became known as The Mystic\r\nof the Way of Peace. Soon he could test his other powers. With a change\r\nof reign-title appeared a terrible pestilence which ran throughout the\r\nland, whereupon Chang Chio distributed charmed remedies of which the\r\nsuccess gained him the title of the Wise and Good Master. He began to\r\nhave a following of disciples whom he initiated into the mysteries and\r\nsent abroad throughout all the land. They, like their master, could\r\nwrite charms and recite formulae and their fame increased his\r\nfollowing. He began to organise his disciples. He established thirty\r\nsix circuits, the larger with a myriad or more members, the smaller\r\nwith about half that number. Each circuit had its chief who took the\r\nmilitary title of General. They talked wildly of the death of the blue\r\nheavens and the setting up of the yellow; they said a new cycle was\r\nbeginning and would bring universal good fortune, and they persuaded\r\npeople to chalk the symbols for the first year of a cycle on the main\r\ndoor of their dwellings.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the number of his supporters grew also the ambition\r\nof the “Wise and Good.” He dreamed of empire. One of his partizans, Ma\r\nYüan-i, was sent bearing gifts to gain the support of the eunuchs\r\nwhereby to have allies within the palace. To his brothers Chang Chio\r\nsaid, “For schemes like ours always the most difficult part is to gain\r\nthe popular favour. But that is already ours. Such an opportunity must\r\nnot pass.” And they began to prepare. Many yellow flags were made and a\r\nday was chosen to strike the first blow.\r\n\r\nThen they wrote letters to the chief eunuch, Fêng Hsü, and sent them by\r\na follower, who alas! betrayed their trust and discovered the plot. The\r\nEmperor summoned his trusty General Ho Chin and bade him look to it. Ma\r\nYüan-i was at once taken and put to death. Fêng Hsü and many others\r\nwere cast into prison.\r\n\r\nThe plot having thus become known the Changs were forced at once to\r\ntake the field. They assumed grandiose titles, Tʻien Kung, or Celestial\r\nDuke, Ti Kung, or Terrestrial Duke, Jên Kung, or Duke of Humanity, and\r\nin these names they put forth this manifesto:—“The good fortune of the\r\nHans is exhausted and the Wise Man has appeared. Discern the will of\r\nHeaven, O ye people, and walk in the way of righteousness, whereby\r\nalone ye may attain to peace.”\r\n\r\nSupport was not lacking. On every side people bound their heads with a\r\nyellow turban and joined the army of the rebel Chang Chio, so that soon\r\nhis strength was exceeding great and the official troops melted away at\r\na whisper of his coming.\r\n\r\nHo Chin, Guardian of the Throne, memorialised for general preparations\r\nagainst the rebels and an edict called upon every one to fight against\r\nthem. In the meantime Lu Chih, Huangfu Sung and Chu Chien marched\r\nagainst them in three directions with veteran soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to turn to Chang Chio. He led his army into Yuchow, the\r\nnorthern of the eight divisions of the country. The Prefect was one Liu\r\nYen, a scion of the Imperial House through a certain Lu, Prince Kung of\r\nChingling. Learning of the approach of the rebels, the Prefect called\r\nin the Hsiao-yü Tsou Ching to consult over the position. Said Tsou,\r\n“They are many and we few; you must enlist more men to oppose them.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect saw this was so and he put out notices calling for\r\nvolunteers to serve against the rebels. One of these notices was posted\r\nup in the Cho district, where lived one of whom much will be heard\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThis man was no mere bookish scholar nor found he any pleasure in\r\nstudy. But he was liberal and amiable, albeit a man of few words,\r\nhiding all feeling under a calm exterior. He had always cherished a\r\nyearning for high emprise and had cultivated the friendship of men of\r\nmark. He was tall of stature. His ears were long, the lobes touching\r\nhis shoulders, and his hands hung down below his knees. His eyes were\r\nvery prominent, so that he could see backward past his ears. His\r\ncomplexion was clear as jade and he had rich red lips. He was a\r\ndescendant of a Prince whose father was the grandson of the Emperor\r\nChing, (the occupant of the dragon throne a century and a half B.C.)\r\nHis name was Liu Pei, or more commonly Liu Yüan-tê. Many years before\r\none of his forbears had been Marquis of that very district, but had\r\nlost his rank for remissness in ceremonial offerings. However, that\r\nbranch of the family had remained on in the place, gradually becoming\r\npoorer and poorer as the years rolled on. His father Liu Hung had been\r\na scholar and an official but died young. The widow and orphan were\r\nleft alone and Pei as a lad won a reputation for filial piety.\r\n\r\nAt this time the family had sunk deep in poverty and the son gained his\r\nliving by the sale of straw sandals and weaving grass mats. The family\r\nhome was in a village near the district city. Near the house stood a\r\nhuge mulberry tree, and seen from afar its curved profile resembled the\r\ntilt of a waggon. Noting the luxuriance of its foliage a soothsayer had\r\npredicted that one day a man of distinction would come forth from the\r\nfamily. As a child Yüan-tê and the other village boys played beneath\r\nthis tree and he would climb up into it, saying he was emperor and was\r\nmounting his chariot. The lad’s uncle recognised that he was no\r\nordinary boy and saw to it that the family did not come to actual want.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê was fifteen his mother sent him travelling for his\r\neducation. For a time he served Chêng Yüan and Lu Chih as masters and\r\nhe became great friends with Kungssun Tsan.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was twenty eight when the outbreak of the rebellion called for\r\nsoldiers. The sight of the notice saddened him and he sighed as he read\r\nit. Suddenly a rasping voice behind him cried, “Noble Sir, why sigh if\r\nyou do nothing to help your country?” Turning quickly he saw standing\r\nthere a man about his own height, with a bullet head like a leopard’s,\r\nlarge eyes, a pointed chin and a bristling moustache. He spoke in a\r\nloud bass voice and looked as irresistible as a runaway horse. At once\r\nYüan-tê saw he was no ordinary man and asked who he was.\r\n\r\n“Chang Fei is my name; I am usually called I-tê” replied the stranger.\r\n“I live near here where I have a farm; and I am a wine-seller and a\r\nbutcher as well. And I like to become acquainted with worthy men. Your\r\nsighs as you read the notice drew me toward you.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “I am of the Imperial Family, Liu by name, and my\r\ndistinguishing name is Pei. An I could I would destroy these rebels and\r\nrestore peace to the land, but alas! I am helpless.”\r\n\r\n“I am not without means,” said Fei. “Suppose you and I raised some men\r\nand tried what we could do.”\r\n\r\nThis was happy news for Yüan-tê and the two betook themselves to the\r\nvillage inn to talk over the project. As they were drinking, a huge,\r\ntall fellow appeared pushing a hand-cart along the road. At the\r\nthreshold he halted and entered the inn to rest awhile and he called\r\nfor wine. “And be quick,” added he “for I am in haste to get into the\r\ntown and offer myself for the army.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê looked over the new-comer item by item and noted his huge\r\nframe, his long beard, his dark brown face and deep red lips. He had\r\neyes like a phœnix and fine bushy eyebrows like silkworms. His whole\r\nappearance was dignified and awe-inspiring. Presently Yüan-tê crossed\r\nover, sat down beside him and asked his name.\r\n\r\n“I am Kuan Yü,” said he; “I used to be known as Shou-chʻang (Long as\r\neternity), but now am usually called Yün-chʻang (Long as a cloud). I am\r\na native of the east side of the river, but I have been a fugitive on\r\nthe waters for some five years, because I slew a ruffian who, since he\r\nwas powerful, was a bully. I have come to join the army here.”\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê told him his own intentions and all three went away to\r\nChang Fei’s farm where they could talk over the grand project.\r\n\r\nSaid Fei, “The peach trees in the orchard behind the house are just in\r\nfull flower. To-morrow we will institute a sacrifice there and solemnly\r\ndeclare our intention before Heaven and Earth. And we three will swear\r\nbrotherhood and unity of aims and sentiments; thus will we enter upon\r\nour great task.”\r\n\r\nAll three being of one mind, next day they prepared the sacrifices, a\r\nblack ox, a white horse and wine for libation. Beneath the smoke of the\r\nincense burning on the altar they bowed their heads and recited this\r\noath:—“We three, Liu Pei, Kuan Yü and Chang Fei, though of different\r\nfamilies, swear brotherhood, and promise mutual help to one end. We\r\nwill rescue each other in difficulty, we will aid each other in danger.\r\nWe swear to serve the state and save the people. We ask not the same\r\nday of birth but we seek to die together. May Heaven, the all-ruling,\r\nand Earth, the all-producing, read our hearts, and if we turn aside\r\nfrom righteousness or forget kindliness may Heaven and man smite us!”\r\n\r\nThey rose from their knees. The two others bowed before Yüan-tê as\r\ntheir elder brother and Chang Fei was to be the youngest of the trio.\r\nThis solemn ceremony performed, they slew other oxen and made a feast\r\nto which they invited the villagers. Three hundred joined them and all\r\nfeasted and drank deep in the Peach Garden.\r\n\r\nThe next day weapons were mustered. But there were no horses to ride.\r\nThis was a real grief, but soon they were cheered by the arrival of two\r\nhorse dealers with a drove of horses.\r\n\r\n“Thus does Heaven help us,” said Yüan-tê and the three brothers went\r\nforth to welcome the merchants. They were from Changshan and went\r\nnorthwards every year to buy horses. They were now on their way home\r\nbecause of the rising. They also came to the farm, where wine was set\r\nbefore them, and presently Yüan-tê told them of the plan to strive for\r\ntranquility. The two dealers were glad and at once gave them fifty good\r\nsteeds, and beside, gold and silver and a thousand catties of steel fit\r\nfor the forging of weapons.\r\n\r\nAfter the merchants had taken their leave, armourers were summoned to\r\nforge weapons. For Yüan-tê they made a double sword. Yün-chʻang\r\nfashioned a long-handled, curved blade called “Black Dragon” or “Cold\r\nBeauty,” which weighed a full hundredweight, and Chang Fei made himself\r\nan eighteen-foot spear. Each too had a helmet and full armour.\r\n\r\nWhen these were ready the troop, now five hundred strong, marched to\r\nTsou Ching, who presented them to Liu Yen. When the ceremony of\r\nintroduction was over, Yüan-tê declared his ancestry and Yen at once\r\naccorded him the favour due to a relation.\r\n\r\nBefore many days it was announced that the rebellion had actually\r\nbroken out and the leader, Chêng Yüan-chih, had invaded the district\r\nwith a huge army. Tsou Ching and the three heroes went out to oppose\r\nthem with the five hundred men. Yüan-tê joyfully undertook to lead the\r\nvan and marched to the foot of the Tahsing Hills where they saw the\r\nrebels. The rebels wore their hair flying about their shoulders and\r\ntheir foreheads were bound with yellow turbans.\r\n\r\nWhen the two armies had been drawn up opposite each other Yüan-tê with\r\nhis two brothers, one on each side, rode to the front and, flourishing\r\nhis whip, began to hurl reproaches at the rebels and called upon them\r\nto surrender. Their leader, full of rage, sent out one Têng Mou to\r\nbegin the battle. At once rode forward Chang Fei, his long spear poised\r\nto strike. One thrust and Têng rolled off his horse pierced through the\r\nheart. At this the leader himself whipped up his steed and rode forth\r\nwith sword raised ready to slay Chang. But Kuan Yü swung up his\r\nponderous weapon and rode at him. At the sight fear seized upon Chêng,\r\nand ere he could recover himself the great sword fell, cutting him in\r\nhalves.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Two heroes new to war’s alarms,\r\n        Ride boldly forth to try their arms.\r\n        Their doughty deeds three kingdoms tell\r\n        And poets sing how these befell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir leader fallen, the rebels threw away their weapons and fled. The\r\nofficial soldiers dashed in among them. Many thousands surrendered and\r\nthe victory was complete. Thus this part of the rebellion was broken\r\nup.\r\n\r\nOn their return the Prefect met them and distributed rewards. But\r\nbefore long letters came from the prefecture of Chingchou saying that\r\nthe rebels were laying siege to the chief city and it was near falling.\r\nHelp was needed quickly.\r\n\r\n“I will go,” said Yüan-tê as soon as he heard the news and he set out\r\nat once with his own men, reinforced by a large body under Tsou Ching.\r\nThe rebels seeing help coming at once attacked most fiercely. The\r\nrelieving force being comparatively small could not prevail and retired\r\nsome thirty li, where they made a camp.\r\n\r\n“They are many and we but few,” said Yüan-tê to his brothers. “We can\r\nonly beat them by superior strategy.”\r\n\r\nSo they prepared an ambush. The two younger brothers, each with a\r\ngoodly party, went behind the hills right and left and there hid. When\r\nthe gongs beat they were to move out to support the main army.\r\n\r\nThese preparations made, the drums rolled for the advance. The rebels\r\nalso came forward. Then Yüan-tê suddenly retired. Thinking this was\r\ntheir chance, the rebels pressed forward and were led over the hills.\r\nThen suddenly the gongs sounded for the ambush to discover itself and\r\nthe rebels were attacked on three sides. They lost heavily and fled to\r\nthe provincial city. But the Prefect led out the men he had to assist\r\nin the battle and the rebels were entirely defeated and many slain.\r\nChingchou was no longer in danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tho’ fierce as tigers soldiers be,\r\n        Battles are won by strategy.\r\n        A hero comes; he gains renown,\r\n        Already destined for a crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the celebrations in honour of victory were over Tsou Ching\r\nproposed to return home, but Yüan-tê preferred to go to the aid of his\r\nold master Lu Chih, then struggling with a horde of rebels led by Chang\r\nChio. So they separated and the three brothers with their troop made\r\ntheir way of Kuangtsung.\r\n\r\nThey found the Prefect in camp, were admitted to his presence and\r\ndeclared the reason of their coming. The Prefect received them with\r\ngreat joy and they remained with him while he made his plans.\r\n\r\nAt that time the rebels there were three to one and the two armies were\r\nfacing each other. Neither had had any success. The Prefect said to Liu\r\nPei, “I am surrounding these rebels here but the other two brothers\r\nChang Liang and Chang Pao are strongly intrenched opposite Huangfu Sung\r\nand Chu Chien at Yingchʻuan. I will give you a thousand more men and\r\nwith these you can go to find out what is happening and we can then\r\nsettle the moment to attack.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê set off and marched as quickly as possible. At that time the\r\nimperial troops were attacking with success and the rebels had retired\r\nupon Changshê. They had encamped among the thick grass, and, seeing\r\nthis, Huangfu decided to attack them by fire. So he bade every man cut\r\na bundle of dry grass and laid an ambush. That night the wind blew a\r\ngale and at the second watch they started a blaze. At the same time the\r\nrebels were attacked. Their camp was set on fire and the flames rose to\r\nthe very heavens. The rebels were thrown into great confusion. There\r\nwas no time to saddle horses or don armour; they fled in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe battle continued till dawn. Chang Liang and Chang Pao, with a few\r\nflying soldiers, found, as they thought, a way of escape. But suddenly\r\na troop of soldiers with crimson banners appeared to oppose them. Their\r\nleader was a man of medium stature with small eyes and a long beard. He\r\nwas one Tsʻao Tsʻao, also known as Tsʻao Mêng-tê, a Pʻeikuo man,\r\nholding the rank of Chi-tu-yü. His father was Tsʻao Sung, who had been\r\nborn to the Hsiahou family, but he had been brought up by the eunuch\r\nTsʻao Tʻêng and had taken his family name. This Tsʻao Tsʻao was Sung’s\r\nson and, as a lad, bore the name of A-man.\r\n\r\nAs a young man Tsʻao Tsʻao had been fond of hunting and delighted in\r\nsongs and dancing. He was resourceful and full of guile. An uncle,\r\nseeing the young fellow so unsteady, used to get angry with him and\r\ntold his father Tsʻao Sung of his misdeeds. His father remonstrated\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nBut the youth was equal to the occasion. One day, seeing his uncle\r\ncoming, he fell to the ground in a pretended fit. The uncle alarmed ran\r\nto tell his father, who came, and there was the youth in most perfect\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n“But your uncle said you were in a fit; are you better?”\r\n\r\n“I have never suffered from fits or any such illness,” said Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao. “But I have lost my uncle’s affection and he has deceived you.”\r\n\r\nThereafter, whatever the uncle might say of his faults, his father paid\r\nno heed. So the young man grew up licentious and uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nA certain man of the time said to Tsʻao Tsʻao, “Rebellion is at hand\r\nand only a man of the greatest ability can succeed in restoring\r\ntranquillity. That man is yourself.”\r\n\r\nAnd Ho Yung of Nanyang said of him, “The dynasty of Han is about to\r\nfall. He who can restore peace is this man and only he.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao went to enquire his future of a wise man of Junan.\r\n\r\n“What manner of man am I?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThe seer made no reply and again he put the question. Then he replied,\r\n“You are able enough to rule the world, but wicked enough to disturb\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao greatly rejoiced to hear this.\r\n\r\nHe graduated at twenty and began his career in a district near Loyang.\r\nIn the four gates of the city he ruled he hung up clubs of various\r\nsorts and any breach of the law met with its punishment whatever the\r\nrank of the offender.\r\n\r\nNow an uncle of a eunuch was found one night in the streets with a\r\nsword and was arrested. In due course he was beaten. Thereafter no one\r\ndared to offend and Tsʻao’s name became terrible. Soon he became a\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of rebellion he held the rank of Chi-tu-yü and was\r\ngiven command of five thousand horse and foot to help fight at\r\nYingchʻuan. He just happened to fall in with the newly defeated rebels\r\nwhom he cut to pieces. Thousands were slain and endless banners and\r\ndrums and horses were captured and not a little money. However the two\r\nleaders got away and, after an interview with Huangfu Sung, Tsʻao went\r\nin pursuit of them.\r\n\r\nWe return now to Yüan-tê. He and his brothers were hastening toward the\r\npoint of danger when they heard the din of battle and saw flames rising\r\nhigh toward the sky. However they arrived too late for the fighting.\r\nThey saw Huangfu and Chu to whom they told the intentions of Lu Chih.\r\n\r\n“The rebel power is quite broken here,” said the chiefs, “but they will\r\nsurely make for Kuangtsung to join Chang Chio. You can do nothing\r\nbetter than hasten back.”\r\n\r\nThe three brothers retraced their steps. Half way along the road they\r\nmet a party of soldiers escorting a prisoner in a cage-cart. When they\r\ndrew near the prisoner was no other than the man they were going to\r\nhelp. Hastily dismounting Liu Pei asked what had happened. Lu Chih\r\nexplained, “I had surrounded the rebels and was on the point of\r\nsmashing them, when Chang Chio employed some of his supernatural powers\r\nand prevented my victory. The Court sent down a eunuch to enquire into\r\nmy failure and that official demanded a bribe. I told him how hard\r\npressed we were and asked him where, in the circumstances, I could find\r\na gift for him. He went away in wrath and reported that I was hiding\r\nbehind my ramparts and would not give battle and I disheartened my men.\r\nSo I was superseded by one Tung Cho and I have to go to the capital to\r\nanswer the charge.”\r\n\r\nThis story put Chang Fei into a rage. He was for slaying the escort and\r\nsetting free the prisoner. But Yüan-tê checked him.\r\n\r\n“The Government will take the proper course,” said he. “You must not\r\nact hastily.” And they went their ways.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to continue on that road so Kuan Yü proposed to go back\r\nand they retook the road. Two days later they heard the thunder of\r\nbattle behind some hills. Hastening to the top they beheld the\r\ngovernment soldiers suffering great loss and they saw the countryside\r\nwas full of Yellow Turbans. On their banners were the words, “Celestial\r\nDuke,” writ large.\r\n\r\n“We will attack this Chang Chio,” said Yüan-tê and they galloped out to\r\njoin in the battle.\r\n\r\nChang Chio had worsted Tung Cho and was following up his advantage. He\r\nwas in hot pursuit when the three brothers dashed into his army, threw\r\nhis ranks into confusion and drove him back. Then they returned with\r\nthe rescued general to his camp.\r\n\r\n“What officers have you?” asked Tung Cho, when he had leisure to speak\r\nto the brothers.\r\n\r\n“None,” was the reply. And Tung treated them with disrespect. Yüan-tê\r\nretired calmly, but Chang Fei was furious.\r\n\r\n“We have just rescued this menial in a bloody fight,” cried he, “and\r\nnow he is rude to us! Nothing but his death can slake my anger.”\r\n\r\nHe would have dashed into the tent and slain the insulter had not his\r\nelder brothers held him back.\r\n\r\n\r\n        As it was in olden time so it is to-day,\r\n        The simple wight may merit well,\r\n            officialdom holds sway;\r\n        Chang Fei, the blunt and hasty,\r\n            where can you find his peer?\r\n        But slaying the ungrateful would\r\n            mean many deaths a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTung Cho’s fate will be unrolled in later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAN OFFICIAL IS THRASHED;\r\nUNCLE HO PLOTS TO KILL THE EUNUCHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must here be told who this Tung Cho was. Cho, or Chung-ying, was\r\nborn in the west at Lintʻao in modern Shênsi. His father was a prefect.\r\nHe himself was arrogant and overbearing. But the day he had treated the\r\nthree brothers with contumely had been his last had not the two elders\r\nrestrained their wrathful brother.\r\n\r\n“Remember he has the government commission;” said Yüan-tê, “who are we\r\nto judge and slay?”\r\n\r\n“It is bitter to take orders from such a wretch; I would rather slay\r\nhim. You may stay here an you wish to, but I will seek some other\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“We three are one in life and in death; there is no parting for us. We\r\nwill all go hence.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Yüan-tê and his brother was satisfied. Wherefore all three set\r\nout and lost no time in travelling till they came to Chu Chien, who\r\nreceived them well and accepted their aid in attacking Chang Pao.\r\n\r\nAt this time Tsʻao Tsʻao had joined himself to Huangfu Sung and they\r\nwere trying to destroy Chang Liang and there was a great battle at\r\nChuyang. At the same time Chang Pao was attacked. The rebel had led his\r\nmen to a strong position in the rear of the hills. An attack being\r\ndecided upon Yüan-tê was hsien-fêng, or leader of the van. On the rebel\r\nside a subordinate leader, Kao Hsing, came out to offer battle. Chang\r\nFei was sent to smite him. Out rode Fei at full speed, his spear ready\r\nset. After a few bouts he wounded Kao, who was unhorsed. At this the\r\nmain army had the signal to advance. Then Chang Pao, while still\r\nmounted, loosened his hair, grasped his sword and uttered his\r\nincantations. Thereupon began the wind to howl and the thunder to roll,\r\nwhile a dense black cloud from the heavens settled upon the field. And\r\ntherein seemed to be horse and footmen innumerable, who swept to attack\r\nthe imperial troops. Fear came upon them and Yüan-tê led off his men,\r\nbut they were in disorder and returned defeated.\r\n\r\nChu Chien and Yüan-tê considered the matter. “He uses magic,” said\r\nChien. “To-morrow, then, will I prepare counter magic in the shape of\r\nthe blood of slaughtered swine and goats and dogs. This blood shall be\r\nsprinkled upon their hosts from the precipices above by men whom they\r\nsee not. Thus shall we be able to break the power of their black art.”\r\n\r\nSo it was done. The two younger brothers took each a company of men and\r\nhid them on the high cliffs behind the hills, and they had a plentiful\r\nsupply of the blood of swine and goats and dogs and all manner of\r\nfilthy things. And so next day, when the rebels with fluttering banners\r\nand rolling drums came out to challenge, Yüan-tê rode forth to meet\r\nthem. At the same moment that the armies met, again Chang Pao began his\r\nmagic and again the elements began to struggle together. Sand flew in\r\nclouds, pebbles were swept along the ground, black masses of vapour\r\nfilled the sky and rolling masses of foot and horse descended from on\r\nhigh. Yüan-tê turned, as before, to flee and the rebels rushed on. But\r\nas they pressed through the hills the trumpets blared and the hidden\r\nsoldiers exploded bombs, threw down filth and spattered blood. The\r\nmasses of men and horses in the air fluttered to the earth as fragments\r\nof torn paper, the wind ceased to blow, the thunder subsided, the sand\r\nsank and the pebbles lay still upon the ground.\r\n\r\nChang Pao quickly saw his magic had been countered and turned to\r\nretire. Then he was attacked on the flanks by the two younger brothers,\r\nand in rear by Yüan-tê and Chu Chien. The rebels were routed. Yüan-tê,\r\nseeing from afar the banner of the “Duke of Earth,” galloped toward it\r\nbut only succeeded in wounding the “Duke” with an arrow in the left\r\narm. Wounded though he was, he got away into Yangchʻêng, where he\r\nfortified himself and was besieged by Chu Chien.\r\n\r\nScouts, sent out to get news of Huangfu, reported that he had been very\r\nsuccessful and Tung Cho had suffered many reverses. Therefore the Court\r\nhad put Huangfu in the latter’s place. Chang Chio had died before his\r\narrival. Chang Liang had added his brother’s army to his own but no\r\nheadway could be made against Huangfu, whose army gained seven\r\nsuccessive victories. And Chang Liang had been slain at Chüyang. Beside\r\nthis Chang Chio’s coffin had been exhumed, the corpse beheaded and the\r\nhead, after exposure, had been sent to the capital. The common crowd\r\nhad surrendered. For these services Huangfu had been promoted and now\r\nruled in Ichou.\r\n\r\nHe had not forgotten his friends. His first act after he had attained\r\nto power was to memorialise concerning the case of Lu Chih, who was\r\nthen restored to his former rank.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao also had received advancement for his services and was\r\npreparing to go south to his new post.\r\n\r\nHearing these things Huangfu Sung pressed harder yet upon Yangchʻêng\r\nand the approaching break-up of the rebellion became evident. Then one\r\nof Chang Pao’s officers killed his leader and brought his head in token\r\nof submission. Thus rebellion in that part of the country was stamped\r\nout and Chu Chien made his report to the government.\r\n\r\nHowever, the embers still smouldered. Three of the rebels Chao Hung,\r\nHan Chung and Sun Chung, began to murder and rob and burn, calling\r\nthemselves the avengers of Chang Chio. The successful Chu Chien was\r\ncommanded to lead his veteran and successful troops to destroy them. He\r\nat once marched toward Wanchʻêng, which the rebels were attacking. When\r\nChu arrived Han Chung was sent to oppose him. Chu Chien sent the three\r\nbrothers, our heroes, to attack the south west angle of the city. Han\r\nChung at once led the best of his men to beat them off. Meanwhile Chu\r\nChien himself led two companies of armoured horsemen to attack the\r\nopposite corner. The rebels, thinking the city lost, abandoned the\r\nsouth west and turned back. The three brothers pressed hotly in their\r\nrear and they were utterly routed. They took refuge in the city which\r\nwas then invested. When famine pressed upon the besieged they sent a\r\nmessenger to offer to surrender but the offer was refused.\r\n\r\nSaid Yüan-tê, “Seeing that the founder of the Han Dynasty could welcome\r\nthe submissive and receive the favourable why reject these?”\r\n\r\n“The conditions are different,” replied Chu Chien. “In those days\r\ndisorder was universal and the people had no fixed lord. Wherefore\r\nsubmission was welcomed and support rewarded to encourage people to\r\ncome over. Now the Empire is united and the Yellow Turbans are the only\r\nmalcontents. To receive their surrender is not to encourage the good.\r\nTo allow brigands, when successful, to give way to every licence, and\r\nto let them surrender when they fail is to encourage brigandage. Your\r\nplan is not a good one.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “Not to let brigands surrender is well. But the city\r\nis surrounded as by an iron barrel. If the rebels’ request be refused\r\nthey will be desperate and fight to the death and a myriad such men\r\ncannot be withstood. In the city there are many times that number, all\r\ndoomed to death. Let us withdraw from one corner and only attack the\r\nopposite. They will all assuredly flee and have no desire to fight. We\r\nshall take them.”\r\n\r\nChu Chien saw that the advice was good and followed it. As predicted\r\nthe rebels ran out, led by Han Chung. The besiegers fell upon them as\r\nthey fled and their leader was slain. They scattered in all directions.\r\nBut the other two rebels came with large reinforcements, and as they\r\nappeared very strong, the government soldiers retired and the new body\r\nof rebels entered Wanchʻêng.\r\n\r\nChu Chien encamped ten li from the city and prepared to attack. Just\r\nthen there arrived a body of horse and foot from the east. They were\r\nled by one Sun Chien.\r\n\r\nSun Chien had a broad open face, was lithe and yet powerfully built. He\r\nwas a native of Wu, a descendant of Sun Wu. His minor name was Wên-tai.\r\nWhen he was seventeen he was with his father on the Chʻientang River\r\nand saw a party of pirates, who had been plundering a merchant,\r\ndividing their booty on the river bank.\r\n\r\n“We can capture these,” said he to his father.\r\n\r\nSo, gripping his sword, he ran boldly up the bank and cried out to this\r\nside and that as if he was calling his men to come on. This made the\r\npirates believe the soldiers were on them and they fled, leaving their\r\nbooty behind them. He actually killed one of the pirates.\r\n\r\nIn this way be became known and was recommended for official rank.\r\nThen, in collaboration with the local officials, he raised a band and\r\nhelped to quell the rebellion of one Hsü Chʻang, who called himself the\r\nYangming Emperor. The rebel’s son was also slain. For this he was\r\ncommended in a memorial to the throne and received further promotion.\r\n\r\nWhen the Yellow Turban rebellion began he gathered together the young\r\nmen of his village, some of the merchant class, got a company and a\r\nhalf of veteran soldiers and took the field. Now he had reached the\r\nfighting area.\r\n\r\nChu Chien welcomed him gladly and ordered him to attack the south gate.\r\nOther gates were simultaneously attacked, but the east gate was left\r\nfree to give the rebels a chance of exit. Sun Chien was the first to\r\nmount the wall and cut down a score of men with his own hand. The\r\nrebels ran, but Chao Hung their leader, rode directly at Sun Chien with\r\nhis spear ready to thrust. Sun Chien leaped down from the wall,\r\nsnatched away the spear and with it knocked the rebel from his horse.\r\nThen mounting the horse he rode hither and thither, slaying as he went.\r\n\r\nThe rebels fled north. Meeting Yüan-tê they declined to fight and\r\nscattered. But Yüan-tê drew his bow, fitted an arrow and wounded their\r\nleader Sun Chung, who fell to the ground. The main army came up, and\r\nafter tremendous slaughter, the others surrendered. Thus was peace\r\nbrought to the country about Nanyang.\r\n\r\nChu Chien led his army to the capital, was promoted to a General of\r\nCavalry and received the governorship of Honan. He did not forget those\r\nwho had helped him to win victory.\r\n\r\nSun Chien, having influential friends to support him, quickly got an\r\nappointment and went to it. But Yüan-tê, in spite of Chu Chien’s\r\nmemorial, waited in vain for preferment and the three brothers became\r\nvery sad.\r\n\r\nWalking along one day Yüan-tê met a Court official, Chang Chün by name,\r\nto whom he related his services and told his sorrows. Chang was much\r\nsurprised at this neglect and one day at Court spoke to the Emperor\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “The Yellow Turbans rebelled because the eunuchs sold offices\r\nand bartered ranks. There was employment only for their friends,\r\npunishment only for their enemies. This led to rebellion. Wherefore it\r\nwould be well to slay the eunuchs and expose their heads and proclaim\r\nwhat had been done throughout the whole empire. Then reward the worthy.\r\nThereby the land would be wholly tranquil.”\r\n\r\nBut the eunuchs fiercely opposed this and said the memorialist was\r\ninsulting the Emperor and they bade the guard thrust him without.\r\n\r\nHowever, the eunuchs took counsel together and one said, “Surely some\r\none who rendered some service against rebels resents being passed\r\nover.”\r\n\r\nSo they caused a list of unimportant people to be prepared for\r\npreferment by and by. Among them was Yüan-tê, who received the post of\r\nmagistrate of the Anhsi district, to which he proceeded without delay\r\nafter disbanding his men and sending them home to their villages. He\r\nretained a score or so as escort.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers reached Anhsi, and soon the administration of the\r\ndistrict was so reformed and the rule so wise that in a month there was\r\nno law-breaking. The three brothers lived in perfect harmony, eating at\r\nthe same table and sleeping on the same couch. But when Yüan-tê was in\r\nthe company of others, the two younger brothers would stand in\r\nattendance, were it even a whole day.\r\n\r\nFour months after their arrival there came out a general order for the\r\nreduction of the number of military officers holding civil posts, and\r\nYüan-tê began to fear that he would be among those thrown out. In due\r\ncourse the inspecting official arrived and was met at the boundary, but\r\nto the polite obeisance of Yüan-tê he made no return, save a wave of\r\nhis whip as he sat on his horse. This made the younger brothers\r\nfurious; but worse was to follow.\r\n\r\nWhen the inspector had arrived at his lodging, he took his seat on the\r\ndaïs leaving Yüan-tê standing below. After a long time he addressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Magistrate Liu, what was your origin?”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “I am descended from Prince Ching. Since my first\r\nfight with the Yellow Turban rebels at Chochün I have been in some\r\nscore of battles, wherein I gained some trifling merit. My reward was\r\nthis office.”\r\n\r\n“You lie about your descent and your statement of services is false,”\r\nroared the inspector. “Now the Court has ordered the reduction of your\r\nsort of low class officials.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê muttered to himself and withdrew. On his return to the\r\nmagistracy he took council with his secretaries.\r\n\r\n“This pompous attitude only means he wants a bribe,” said they.\r\n\r\n“I have never wronged the people to the value of a single stalk of\r\nstubble; then where is a bribe to come from?”\r\n\r\nNext day the inspector had the minor officials before him and forced\r\nthem to bear witness that their master had oppressed the people.\r\nYüan-tê time after time went to rebut this charge, but the doorkeepers\r\ndrove him away and he could not enter.\r\n\r\nNow Chang Fei had been all day drowning his sorrow in wine and had\r\ndrunk far too much. Calling for his horse he rode out past the lodging\r\nof the inspector, and at the gate saw a small crowd of white-haired men\r\nweeping bitterly. He asked why. They said, “The inspector has compelled\r\nthe underlings to bear false witness against our magistrate, with the\r\ndesire to injure the noble Liu. We came to beg mercy for him, but are\r\nnot permitted to enter. Moreover, we have been beaten by the\r\ndoorkeepers.”\r\n\r\nThis provoked the irascible and half intoxicated man to fury. His eyes\r\nopened till they became circles; he ground his teeth; in a moment he\r\nwas off his steed, had forced his way past the scared doorkeepers into\r\nthe building and was in the rear apartments. There he saw the inspector\r\nsitting on high with the official underlings in bonds at his feet.\r\n\r\n“Oppressor of the people, robber!” cried Fei, “do you know me?”\r\n\r\nBut before he could reply Fei had him by the hair and had dragged him\r\ndown. Another moment he was outside and firmly lashed to the hitching\r\npost in front of the building. Then breaking off a switch from a willow\r\ntree Fei gave his victim a severe thrashing, only staying his hand when\r\nthe switch was too short to strike with.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was sitting alone, communing with his sorrow, when he heard a\r\nshouting before his door. He asked what was the matter. They told him\r\nGeneral Chang had bound somebody to a post and was thrashing him.\r\nHastily going outside he saw who the unhappy victim was and asked the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n“If we do not beat this sort of wretch to death what may we expect?”\r\nsaid Fei.\r\n\r\n“Noble Sir, save me,” cried the victim.\r\n\r\nNow Yüan-tê had always been kindly and gracious, wherefore he bade his\r\nbrother release the officer and go his way.\r\n\r\nThen Kuan Yü came up saying, “Brother, after your magnificent services\r\nyou only got this petty post and even here you have been insulted by\r\nthis fellow. A thorn bush is no place for a phoenix. Let us slay this\r\nfellow, leave here and go home till we can evolve a bigger scheme.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê contented himself with hanging the official seal about the\r\ninspector’s neck saying, “If I hear that you injure the people I will\r\nassuredly kill you. I now spare your life and I return to you the seal.\r\nWe are going.”\r\n\r\nThe inspector went to the Prefect and complained, and orders were\r\nissued for the arrest of the brothers, but they got away to Taichou and\r\nsought refuge with Liu Hui, who sheltered them because of Liu Pei’s\r\nnoble birth.\r\n\r\nBut nothing will be here related of this. By this time the Ten Eunuchs\r\nhad everything in their hands and they put to death all who did not\r\nstand in with them. From every officer who had helped to put down the\r\nrebels they demanded presents, and if these were not forthcoming he was\r\nremoved from office. Huangfu and Chu both fell victims to these\r\nintrigues, while on the other hand the eunuchs received the highest\r\nhonours. Thirteen of them were ennobled. The government grew worse and\r\nworse and every one was irritated.\r\n\r\nRebellion broke out in Changsha led by one Ou Hsing, and in other\r\nplaces. Memorials were sent up in number as snow flakes in winter, but\r\nthe eunuchs suppressed them all. One day the Emperor was at a feast in\r\none of the gardens with the eunuchs when a certain high minister Liu\r\nTʻao suddenly appeared showing very great distress. The Emperor asked\r\nwhat was the matter.\r\n\r\n“Sire, how can you be feasting with these when the Empire is at the\r\nlast gasp?” said Liu Tʻao.\r\n\r\n“All is well,” said the Emperor, “Where is anything wrong?”\r\n\r\nSaid Tʻao, “Robbers swarm on all sides and plunder the cities. And all\r\nis the fault of the Ten Eunuchs who sell offices and injure the people,\r\noppress the prince and deceive their superiors. All virtuous men have\r\nleft the services and misfortune is before our very eyes.”\r\n\r\nAt this the eunuchs pulled off their hats and threw themselves at their\r\nmaster’s feet.\r\n\r\n“His Excellency disapproves of us,” they said, “and we are in danger.\r\nWe pray that our lives be spared and we may go to our homes. Lo! we\r\nyield our property to help defray military expenses.”\r\n\r\nAnd they wept bitterly. The Emperor turned angrily to the minister,\r\nsaying, “You also have servants; why can you not bear with mine?”\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he called to the guards to eject Tʻao and put him to\r\ndeath. Liu Tʻao cried aloud, “My death matters nothing. The pity is\r\nthat the Hans, after four centuries of reign, are falling fast.”\r\n\r\nThe guards hustled him away and were just about to carry cut their\r\norders when another minister stopped them, saying, “Strike not! Wait\r\ntill I have spoken with His Majesty.”\r\n\r\nIt was the Ssŭ-tu, Chên Tan. He went in to the Emperor, to whom he\r\nsaid, “For what fault is Liu the Censor to be put to death?” “He has\r\nvilified my servants; and has insulted me,” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“All the Empire would eat the flesh of the eunuchs if they could, and\r\nyet, Sire, you respect them as if they were your parents. They have no\r\nmerit, but they are created nobles. Moreover, Fêng Hsü was in league\r\nwith the late rebels. Unless Your Majesty looks to it the State will\r\nfall.”\r\n\r\n“There was no proof against Fêng,” replied the Emperor. “Are there none\r\nfaithful among the eunuchs?”\r\n\r\nThe minister beat his forehead on the steps of the throne and did not\r\ndesist from remonstrance. Then the Emperor grew angry and commanded his\r\nremoval and imprisonment with Liu Tʻao. That night he was murdered.\r\n\r\nThen a forged edict went forth making Sun Chien Prefect of Changsha,\r\nwith orders to suppress the rebellion, and in less than two months he\r\nreported the district all tranquil. For this he was created Marquis of\r\nWuchʻêng. Further Liu Yü was made magistrate of Yuchow to move against\r\nYüyang and suppress Chang Chü and Chang Shun. The Prefect of Taichou\r\nrecommended Yüan-tê to Liu Yü, who welcomed him and gave him rank and\r\nsent him against the rebels. He fought with and worsted them, and\r\nentirely broke their spirit. Chang Shun was cruel and his men turned\r\nagainst him. One of his officers then slew him and brought in his head,\r\nafter which the others submitted. The other leader Chang Chü saw that\r\nall was lost and committed suicide.\r\n\r\nYüyang being now tranquil Liu Pei’s services were reported to the\r\nthrone and he received full pardon for the insult to the inspector. He\r\nalso became an official in Michʻêng. Then Sun Chien stated his previous\r\ngood services and he was made Pieh-pu Ssŭ-ma and sent to Pʻingyüan.\r\n\r\nThis place was very prosperous and Yüan-tê recovered something of his\r\nold manner before the days of adversity. Liu Yü also received\r\npreferment.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year A.D. 189 the Emperor became seriously ill and\r\nsummoned Ho Chin into the palace to arrange for the future. This man Ho\r\nhad sprung from a humble family of butchers, but a sister had become a\r\nconcubine of rank and borne a son to the Emperor, named Pien. After\r\nthis she became Huang-hou or Empress and Ho Chin became powerful. The\r\nEmperor had also greatly loved a beautiful girl named Wang who had\r\nborne him a son named Hsieh. The Empress Ho had poisoned the girl from\r\njealousy, and the babe had been given into the care of the Empress\r\nDowager Tung, who was the mother of the Emperor Ling. She was the wife\r\nof Liu Chang, the Marquis of Tu-ting. As time went on and the Emperor\r\nHuan had no son of his own he adopted the son of the marquis, who\r\nsucceeded as the Emperor Ling. After his accession he had taken his own\r\nmother into the palace to live and had conferred upon her the title of\r\nTʻai-hou, or Empress Dowager.\r\n\r\nThe Dowager Empress had always tried to persuade her son to name Hsieh\r\nas the Heir Apparent, and in fact the Emperor greatly loved the boy and\r\nwas disposed to do as his mother desired. When he fell ill one of the\r\neunuchs said, “If Hsieh is to succeed, Ho Chin must be killed.” The\r\nEmperor saw this too and commanded Ho Chin to come to him. But at the\r\nvery gates of the palace Ho had been warned of his danger and had\r\nsecreted himself. Ho had then called many of the ministers to his side\r\nand they met to consider how to put the eunuchs to death.\r\n\r\nAt this assembly Tsʻao Tsʻao had spoken saying, “The influence of the\r\neunuchs dates back half a century and has spread like a noxious weed in\r\nall directions. How can we hope to destroy it? Above all keep this plot\r\nsecret or you will be exterminated.”\r\n\r\nHo Chin was very angry at this speech and cried, “What do inferiors\r\nlike you know of the ways of government?”\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of the confusion a messenger came to say the Emperor\r\nwas no more. He also told them the eunuchs had decided to keep the\r\ndeath a secret and forge a command to Ho, the ‘State Uncle,’ to come\r\ninto the palace to settle the succession. Meanwhile to prevent trouble\r\nthey had inscribed the name of Hsieh on the roll. And as he finished\r\nspeaking the edict arrived.\r\n\r\n“The matter for the moment is to set up the rightful heir,” said Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao. “The other affair can wait.”\r\n\r\n“Who dares to join me?” asked Ho Chin.\r\n\r\nAt once one stood forward saying, “Give me five companies of veterans\r\nand we will break into the palace, set up the true heir, slay the\r\neunuchs and sweep clean the government. Then will follow peace.”\r\n\r\nThe energetic speaker was Yüan Shao, who then held the rank of\r\nHsiao-yü.\r\n\r\nHo Chin mustered five companies of the guards. Shao put on complete\r\narmour and took command. Ho Chin, supported by a large number of\r\nministers, went into the palace and in the hall where lay the coffin of\r\nthe late Emperor they placed Pien on the throne. After the ceremony was\r\nover and all had bowed before the new Ruler, Yüan Shao went in to\r\narrest the eunuch Chien Shih. Shih in terror fled into the palace\r\ngarden and hid among the shrubs, where he was discovered and murdered\r\nby another eunuch. The guards under his command went over to the other\r\nside. Shao thought the moment most opportune to slay all the eunuchs\r\nand it had been well if his advice had been taken. But the eunuchs\r\nscented the danger and went to the Empress Dowager Ho.\r\n\r\nThey said, “The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien\r\nShih; only he was concerned and no other. Now General Ho, on his\r\nlieutenant’s advice, wishes to slay every one of us. We implore thy\r\npity, O Grandmother.”\r\n\r\n“Fear not,” said she, “I will protect you.”\r\n\r\nShe sent for her brother, and said, “I and you are of lowly origin and\r\nwe owe our good fortune to the eunuchs. The misguided Chien Shih is now\r\ndead and need you really put all the others to death as Yüan Shao\r\nadvises?”\r\n\r\nAnd Ho Chin obeyed her wish. He explained to his party that the real\r\noffender having met his fate they need not exterminate the whole party\r\nnor injure his colleagues.\r\n\r\n“Slay them, root and branch,” cried Shao, “or they will ruin you.”\r\n\r\n“I have decided;” said Ho, coldly, “say no more.”\r\n\r\nWithin a few days Ho became a President of a Board and his friends\r\nreceived offices.\r\n\r\nTung Tʻai-hou summoned the eunuch Chang Jang and his party to a\r\ncouncil. Said she, “It was I who first brought forward the sister of Ho\r\nChin. To-day her son is on the throne and all the officials are her\r\nfriends and her influence is enormous. What can we do?”\r\n\r\nJang replied, “Madam should administer the state from ‘behind the\r\nveil’; create the Emperor’s son Hsieh a prince; give ‘Uncle’ Tung high\r\nrank and place him over the army and use us. That will do it.”\r\n\r\nTung Tʻai-hou approved. Next day she held a court and issued an edict\r\nin the sense proposed. When Ho Tʻai-hou saw this she prepared a banquet\r\nto which she invited her rival. In the middle of the feast, when all\r\nwere well warmed with wine, she rose and offered a cup to her guest\r\nsaying, “It is not fitting that we two women should meddle in state\r\naffairs. Of old when Lü Tʻai-hou laid hands upon the government all her\r\nclan were put to death. We ought to remain content, immured in our\r\npalaces, and leave state affairs to the statesmen. That would be well\r\nfor the country and I trust you will act thus.”\r\n\r\nBut the Empress Tung only got angry. “You poisoned the lady Wang out of\r\njealousy. Now, relying upon the fact that your son sits on the throne\r\nand that your brother is powerful, you speak these wild words. I will\r\ncommand that your brother be beheaded and that can be done as easily as\r\nI turn my hand.”\r\n\r\nThen Empress Ho in her turn waxed wroth and said, “I tried to persuade\r\nyou with fair words; why get so angry?”\r\n\r\n“You low born daughter of a butcher, what do you know of offices?”\r\ncried her rival.\r\n\r\nAnd the quarrel waxed hot.\r\n\r\nThe eunuchs persuaded the ladies to retire. But in the night Ho\r\nTʻai-hou summoned her brother into the palace and told him what had\r\noccurred. He went out and took counsel with the principal officers of\r\nstate. Next morn a court was held and a memorial was presented saying\r\nthat Tung Tʻai-hou, being the consort of a “frontier” prince—only a\r\ncollateral—could not properly occupy any part of the palace. She was to\r\nbe removed into Hochien and was to depart immediately. And while they\r\nsent an escort to remove the lady a strong guard was placed about her\r\nbrother’s dwelling. They took away his seal of office and he, knowing\r\nthis was the end, committed suicide in his private apartments. His\r\ndependents, who wailed his death, were driven off by the guards.\r\n\r\nTwo of the eunuchs having lost their patroness, sent large gifts to Ho\r\nChin’s younger brother Miao and his mother, and thus got them to put in\r\na good word to the Empress Dowager Ho so as to gain her protection. And\r\nso they gained favour once more at court.\r\n\r\nA few months later the secret emissaries of Ho Chin murdered Tung\r\nTʻai-hou in her residence in the country. Her remains were brought to\r\nthe capital and buried. Ho Chin feigned illness and did not attend the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao went one day to see Ho Chin to tell him that two eunuchs,\r\nChang Jang and Tuan Kuei, were spreading the report outside that Ho\r\nChin had caused the death of the late empress dowager and was aiming at\r\nthe throne. He urged Ho to make this an excuse to put them finally out\r\nof the way. Shao pointed out how Tou Wu had missed his chance because\r\nthe secret had not been kept and urged upon him the ease with which\r\nthey could be destroyed under the then favourable conditions. It was a\r\nheaven-sent opportunity.\r\n\r\nBut Ho Chin replied, “Let me think it over.”\r\n\r\nHis servants secretly told the intended victims, who sent further gifts\r\nto the younger brother. Corrupted by these he went in to speak with his\r\nsister and said, “The General is the chief support of the new Emperor,\r\nyet he is not gracious and merciful but thinks wholly of slaughter. If\r\nhe slay the eunuchs without cause, it may bring about revolution.”\r\n\r\nSoon after her brother entered and told her of his design to put the\r\neunuchs to death. She argued with him. She said that they looked after\r\npalace affairs and were old servants. To kill the old servants just\r\nafter the death of their master would appear disrespectful to the\r\nDynasty. And as Ho was of a vacillating mind he murmured assent and\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\n“What about it?” said Shao on meeting him.\r\n\r\n“She will not consent; what can be done?”\r\n\r\n“Call up an army and slay them; it is imperative. Never mind her\r\nconsent.”\r\n\r\n“That is an excellent plan,” said Ho.\r\n\r\nAnd he sent orders all round to march soldiers to the capital.\r\n\r\nBut the Recorder, Chʻên Lin, said, “Nay; do not act blindly. The\r\nproverb says ‘To cover the eyes and snatch at swallows is to fool one’s\r\nself.’ If in so small a matter you cannot attain your wish, what of\r\ngreat affairs? Now by virtue of the imperial prestige and with the army\r\nunder your hand you may do as you please. To use such enormous powers\r\nagainst the eunuchs would resemble lighting up a furnace to burn a\r\nhair. But act promptly; use your powers and smite at once and all the\r\nEmpire will be with you. But to summon forces to the capital, to gather\r\nmany bold men into one spot, each with his own schemes, is to turn\r\none’s weapons against one’s own person, to place one’s self in the\r\npower of another. Nothing but failure can come of it, nothing but\r\nconfusion.”\r\n\r\n“The view of a mere bookworm,” said Ho with a smile.\r\n\r\nThen one of those about him suddenly clapped his hands, crying,\r\n\r\n“It is as easy as turning over one’s hand! why so much talk?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wouldst thou withdraw wicked men from thy prince’s side\r\n    Then seek counsel of the wise men of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Tsʻao Tsʻao said will be disclosed in later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTUNG CHO SILENCES TING YÜAN:\r\nLI SU BRIBES LÜ PU.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Tsʻao Tsʻao said was this: “The eunuch evil is of very old\r\nstanding, but the real cause of the present trouble is in the improper\r\ninfluence allowed them by the ruler, and the misplaced favouritism they\r\nhave enjoyed. But a gaoler would be ample force to employ against the\r\nevil. Why increase confusion by summoning troops from the provinces?\r\nAny desire to slay them will speedily become known and the plan will\r\nfail.”\r\n\r\n“Then Mêng-tê, you have some scheme of your own to further,” said Ho\r\nwith a sneer.\r\n\r\n“Ho Chin is the man to throw the empire into confusion,” retorted\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen Ho Chin sent swift, secret letters far and wide.\r\n\r\nIt must be recalled here that the now powerful Tung Cho had failed in\r\nhis attempt to destroy the Yellow Turban rebellion and would have been\r\npunished but for the protection of the Ten Eunuchs, whom he had bribed\r\nheavily. Later he obtained an important military command in the west.\r\nBut he was treacherous and disloyal at heart. So when he received the\r\nsummons to the capital he rejoiced greatly and lost no time in obeying\r\nit. He left a son-in-law Niu Fu to hold Shênsi and set out for Loyang.\r\n\r\nLi Ju, his adviser and son-in-law said, “Though a formal summons has\r\ncome there are many obscurities in it. It would be well to send up a\r\nmemorial stating plainly our aims and intentions. Then we can proceed.”\r\nSo he composed one something like this: “Thy servant knows that the\r\ncontinual rebellions owe their origin to the eunuchs who act counter to\r\nall recognised precept. Now to stop the ebullition of a pot the best\r\nway is to withdraw the fire; to cut out an abscess, though painful, is\r\nbetter than to nourish the evil. I have dared to undertake a military\r\nadvance on the capital, and now pray that Chang Jang and the other\r\neunuchs be removed for the happiness of the Dynasty and of the whole\r\nland.”\r\n\r\nHo Chin read this memorial and showed it to his partisans. Then said\r\nCheng Tʻai, “A fierce wild beast; if he come his prey will be men.”\r\n\r\nHo Chin replied, “You are too timorous; you are unequal to great\r\nschemes.”\r\n\r\nBut Lu Chih also said, “Long have I known this man; in appearance\r\ninnocent, he is a very wolf at heart. Let him in and calamity enters\r\nwith him. Stop him; do not let him come and thus will you avoid\r\nconfusion.”\r\n\r\nHo Chin was obstinate and both these men gave up their posts and\r\nretired, as did more than half the ministers of State, while Ho Chin\r\nsent a warm welcome to Tung Cho, who soon camped at Ying Pool.\r\n\r\nThe eunuchs knew this move was directed against them and recognised\r\nthat their only chance for safety was to strike the first blow. So they\r\nfirst hid a band of armed ruffians in the palace at the Gate of\r\nAbundant Virtue and then went in to see the Empress.\r\n\r\nThey said, “The General, feigning to act under command, has called up\r\narmies to the capital to destroy us. We pray you, Grandmother, to pity\r\nand save us.”\r\n\r\n“Go to the General and confess your faults,” said she.\r\n\r\n“If we did then should we be cut to mincemeat. Rather summon the\r\nGeneral into your presence and command him to cease. If he will not,\r\nthen we pray but to die in your presence.”\r\n\r\nShe issued the requisite command and Ho was just going to her when\r\nChʻên Lin advised him not to enter, saying the eunuchs were certainly\r\nbehind the order and meant him harm. But Ho could only see the command\r\nof the Empress and was blind to all else.\r\n\r\n“The plot is no longer a secret”; said Yüan Shan, “still you may go if\r\nyou are ready to fight your way in.”\r\n\r\n“Get the eunuchs out first,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Silly children!” said Ho. “What can they do against the man who holds\r\nthe forces of the Empire in the palm of his hand?”\r\n\r\nShao said, “If you will go, then we will come as a guard, just as a\r\nprecaution.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon both he and Tsʻao chose a half company of the best men under\r\ntheir command, at whose head they placed a brother of Yüan Shao, named\r\nShu.\r\n\r\nYüan Shu, clad in mail, drew up his men outside the Chingso Gate while\r\nthe other two went as escort. When Ho Chin neared the palace the\r\neunuchs said, “The orders are to admit the General and none other.” So\r\nthe escort was detained outside.\r\n\r\nHo Chin went in proudly. At the Gate of Abundant Virtue he was met by\r\nthe two chief eunuchs and their followers quickly closed in around him.\r\nHo began to feel alarmed. Then Chang Jang in a harsh voice began to\r\nrevile him.\r\n\r\n“What crime had Tung Tʻai-hou committed that she should have been put\r\nto death? And when the Mother of the Country was buried, who feigned\r\nsickness and did not attend? We raised you and your paltry, huckstering\r\nfamily to all the dignity and wealth you have, and this is your\r\ngratitude! You would slay us. You call us sordid and dirty; who is the\r\ncleaner?”\r\n\r\nHo Chin was panic stricken and looked about for a way to escape, but\r\nthe eunuchs closed him in and then the assassins appeared and did their\r\nbloody work.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Closing the days of the Hans, and the years of their rule were\r\n                                                            near spent,\r\n    Stupid and tactless was Ho Chin, yet stood he highest in office;\r\n    Many were they who advised him, but he was deaf as he heard not;\r\n    Wherefore fell he a victim under the swords of the eunuchs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Ho Chin died. Yüan Shao waited long. By and by, impatient at the\r\ndelay, he called through the Gate, “Thy carriage waits, O General.” For\r\nreply the head of the murdered officer was flung over the wall.\r\n\r\nA decree was proclaimed that Ho Chin had contemplated treachery and\r\ntherefore had been slain. It pardoned his adherents. Yüan Shao shouted,\r\n“The eunuchs have slain the minister. Let those who will slay this\r\nwicked party come and help me.”\r\n\r\nThen one of Ho Chin’s officers set fire to the gate. Yüan Shu at the\r\nhead of his men burst in and fell to slaying the eunuchs without regard\r\nto age or rank. Yüan Shao and Tsʻao Tsʻao broke into the inner part of\r\nthe palace. Four of the eunuchs fled to the Blue Flower Lodge where\r\nthey were hacked to pieces. Fire raged, destroying the buildings. Four\r\nof the eunuchs led by Chang Jang carried off the Empress, the heir\r\napparent and the Prince of Chʻên-liu toward the north palace.\r\n\r\nLu Chih, since he had resigned office, was at home, but hearing of the\r\nrevolution in the palace he donned his armour, took his spear and\r\nprepared to fight. He saw the eunuch Tuan Kuei hurrying the Empress\r\nalong and called out “You rebels, how dare you abduct the Empress?” The\r\neunuch fled. The Empress leaped out of a window and was taken to a\r\nplace of safety.\r\n\r\nWu Kʻuang burst into one of the inner halls where he found Ho Miao,\r\nsword in hand.\r\n\r\n“You also were in the plot to slay your brother,” cried he. “You shall\r\ndie with the others.”\r\n\r\n“Let us kill the plotter against his elder brother,” cried many.\r\n\r\nMiao looked around; his enemies hemmed him in on every side. He was\r\nhacked to pieces.\r\n\r\nShao bade his soldiers scatter and seek out all the families of the\r\neunuchs, sparing none. In that slaughter many beardless men were killed\r\nin error.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao set himself to extinguish the fires. He then begged Ho\r\nTʻai-hou to undertake the direction of affairs and soldiers were sent\r\nto pursue Chang Jang and rescue the young Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe two chief eunuchs, Chang Jang and Tuan Kuei, had hustled away the\r\nEmperor and the Prince of Chʻên-liu. They burst through the smoke and\r\nfire and travelled without stopping till they reached the Peimang\r\nHills. It was then the third watch. They heard a great shouting behind\r\nthem and saw soldiers in pursuit. Their leader was shouting “Stop,\r\nstop!” Chang Jang, seeing that he was lost, jumped into the river,\r\nwhere he was drowned.\r\n\r\nThe two boys ignorant of the meaning of all this confusion and\r\nterrified out of their senses, dared not utter a cry; they crept in\r\namong the rank grass on the river bank and hid. The soldiers scattered\r\nin all directions but failed to find them. So they remained till the\r\nfourth watch, shivering with cold from the drenching dew and very\r\nhungry. They lay down in the thick grass and wept in each other’s arms,\r\nsilently, lest any one should discover them.\r\n\r\n“This is no a place to stay in,” said the Prince, “we must find some\r\nway out.”\r\n\r\nSo the two children knotted their clothes together and managed to crawl\r\nup the bank. They were in a thicket of thorn bushes and it was quite\r\ndark. They could not see any path. They were in despair when, all at\r\nonce, millions of fireflies sprang up all about them and circled in the\r\nair in front of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“God is helping us,” said the Prince.\r\n\r\nThey followed whither the fireflies led and gradually got into a road.\r\nThey walked till their feet were too sore to go further, when, seeing a\r\nheap of straw near the road, they crept to it and lay down.\r\n\r\nThis heap of straw was close to a farm house. In the night, as the\r\nfarmer was sleeping, he saw in a vision two bright red suns drop behind\r\nhis dwelling. Alarmed by the portent he hastily dressed and went forth\r\nto look about him. Then he saw a bright light shooting up from a heap\r\nof straw. He hastened thither and then saw two youths lying behind it.\r\n\r\n“To what household do you belong, young gentlemen?” asked he.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was too frightened to reply, but his companion said, “He is\r\nthe Emperor. There has been a revolution in the palace and we ran away.\r\nI am his brother Prince of Chʻên-liu.”\r\n\r\nThe farmer bowed again and again and said, “I am the brother of a\r\nformer official and my name is Tsʻui I. My brother was disgusted with\r\nthe behaviour of the eunuchs and so resigned and hid away here.”\r\n\r\nThe two lads were taken into the farm and their host on his knees\r\nserved them with refreshment.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Min Kung had gone in pursuit of the eunuch Tuan\r\nKuei. By and by Kung overtook him and cried, “Where is the Emperor?”\r\n\r\n“He disappeared. I do not know where he is.”\r\n\r\nKung slew him and hung the bleeding head on his horse’s neck. Then he\r\nsent his men searching in all directions and he rode off by himself on\r\nthe same quest. Presently he came to the farm. Tsʻui I, seeing what\r\nhung on his horse’s neck, questioned him and, satisfied with his story,\r\nled him to the Emperor. The meeting was affecting; all were moved to\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n“The State cannot be without its ruler,” said Min Kung. “I pray Your\r\nMajesty to return to the city.”\r\n\r\nAt the farm they had but one sorry nag and this they saddled for the\r\nEmperor. The young prince was taken on Min Kung’s charger. And thus\r\nthey left the farm. Soon they fell in with other officials and the\r\nseveral guards and soldiers made up an imposing cavalcade. Tears were\r\nshed freely as the ministers met their Emperor.\r\n\r\nA man was sent on in front to the capital there to expose the head of\r\nthe eunuch Tuan Kuei.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they could they placed the Emperor on a better steed and the\r\nyoung prince had a horse to himself.\r\n\r\nThus the Emperor returned to Loyang and so it happened after all as the\r\nstreet boys’ ditty ran:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though the Emperor doesn’t rule, though the prince no office fills,\r\n    Yet a brilliant cavalcade comes along from Peimang Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade had not proceeded far when they saw coming towards them a\r\nlarge body of soldiers with fluttering banners hiding the sun and\r\nraising a huge cloud of dust. The officials turned pale and the Emperor\r\nwas greatly alarmed. Yüan Shao rode out in advance and demanded who\r\nthey were. From under the shade of an embroidered banner rode out an\r\nofficer demanding if they had seen the Emperor. His Majesty was too\r\npanic-stricken to respond but the Prince of Chʻên-liu rode to the front\r\nand cried, “Who are you?”\r\n\r\nTung Cho replied giving his name and rank.\r\n\r\n“Have you come to protect the chariot or to steal it?” said the prince.\r\n\r\n“I have come to protect,” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\n“If that is so the Emperor is here; why do you not dismount?”\r\n\r\nCho hastily dismounted and made obeisance on the left of the road. Then\r\nthe prince spoke graciously to him.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last the prince had carried himself most perfectly so\r\nthat Cho in his heart admired his behaviour, and then arose the first\r\ndesire to set aside the Emperor in favour of the prince.\r\n\r\nThey reached the palace the same day and there was an affecting\r\ninterview with Ho Tʻai-hou.\r\n\r\nBut when they had restored order in the palace the Hereditary Seal, the\r\nspecial seal of the Emperor, was missing.\r\n\r\nTung Cho camped without the walls but every day he was to be seen in\r\nthe streets with an escort of mailed soldiers so that the common people\r\nwere in a state of constant trepidation. He also went in and out of the\r\npalace careless of all the rules of propriety.\r\n\r\nPao Hsin spoke of his behaviour to Yüan Shao, saying, “This man\r\nharbours some evil design and should be removed.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be done till the government is more settled,” said Shao.\r\n\r\nThen he saw Wang Yün and asked what he thought.\r\n\r\n“Let us talk it over,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nPao Hsin said no more but he left the capital and retired to Tʻaishan.\r\nTung Cho induced the soldiers of the two brothers Ho to join his\r\ncommand and privately spoke to his adviser about deposing the Emperor\r\nin favour of the Prince of Chʻên-liu.\r\n\r\n“The government is really without a head; there can be no better time\r\nthan this to carry out your plan. Delay will spoil all. To-morrow\r\nassemble the officials in the Wênming Garden and address them on the\r\nsubject. Put all opponents to death and your prestige is settled.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke his adviser and the words pleased Tung Cho mightily.\r\n\r\nSo the next day he spread a feast and invited many guests. As all the\r\nofficers went in terror of him no one dared be absent. He himself rode\r\nup to the garden last of all and took his place with his sword girded\r\non. When the wine had gone round several times Tung Cho stopped the\r\nservice and the music and began to speak.\r\n\r\n“I have something to say; listen quietly all of you.”\r\n\r\nAll turned towards him.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor is lord of all and if he lacks dignity and behaves in an\r\nunseemly manner he is no fitting inheritor of the ancestral\r\nprerogatives. He who is now on the throne is a weakling, inferior to\r\nthe Prince of Chʻên-liu in intelligence and love of learning. The\r\nPrince is in every way fitted for the throne. I desire to depose the\r\nEmperor and set up the Prince in his place. What think you?”\r\n\r\nThe assembly listened in perfect silence, none daring at first to utter\r\na word of dissent. But one dared; for suddenly a guest stood up in his\r\nplace, smote the table and cried.\r\n\r\n“No! No! who are you, that you dare utter such bold words? The Emperor\r\nis the son of the lawful consort and has done no wrong. Why then should\r\nhe be deposed? Are you a rebel?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Ting Yüan, governor of Chinchow.\r\n\r\nCho glared at him. “There is life for those who are with me, death for\r\nthose against,” roared he.\r\n\r\nHe drew his sword and made for the objector. But the watchful Li Ju had\r\nnoticed standing behind Ting Yüan a particularly dangerous looking\r\nhenchman of his, who was now handling his spear threateningly, and\r\nwhose eyes were blazing with anger. So he hastily interposed, saying,\r\n“But this is the banquet chamber and state affairs should be left\r\noutside. The matters can be fully discussed to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHis fellow guests persuaded Ting Yüan to leave, and after his departure\r\nTung Cho said, “Is what I said just and reasonable?”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Illustrious Sir,” said Lu Chih. “Of old [1] Tai Chia\r\nwas unenlightened. Wherefore I Yin immured him in the Tʻung Palace till\r\nhe reformed. Later [2] Prince Chʻang I ascended the throne, and in less\r\nthan a month he committed more than three thousand categorical faults.\r\nWherefore Ho Kuang, the regent, declared in the ancestral temple that\r\nhe was deposed. Our present Emperor is young, but he is intelligent,\r\nbenevolent and wise. He has not committed a single fault. You, Sir, are\r\nnot a metropolitan official and have had no experience in state\r\nadministration. Neither have you the pure intentions of I Yin which\r\nqualified his actions. Without that justification such an act is\r\npresumption.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho angrily drew his sword to slay the bold speaker, but another\r\nofficial remonstrated.\r\n\r\n“President Lu is the cynosure of the whole country and his violent\r\ndeath would stir the hearts of all men,” said Pʻêng Po.\r\n\r\nThen Tung Cho stayed his hand.\r\n\r\nThen said Wang Yün, “A great question like the deposition and\r\nsubstitution of Emperors is not one to be decided after a wine party.\r\nLet it be put off till another time.”\r\n\r\nSo the guests dispersed. Cho stood at the gate with drawn sword\r\nwatching them depart.\r\n\r\nStanding thus he noticed a spearman galloping to and fro on a fiery\r\nsteed and asked Li Ju if he knew him.\r\n\r\n“That is Lü Pu, the adopted son of Ting Yüan. His ordinary name is\r\nFênhsien. You must keep out of his way, my lord.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho went inside the gate so that he could not be seen. But next\r\nday a man reported to him that Ting Yüan had come out of the city with\r\na small army and was challenging to a battle. Tung Cho went forth to\r\naccept the challenge. And the armies were drawn up in proper array.\r\n\r\nLü Pu was a conspicuous figure in the forefront. His hair was arranged\r\nunder a handsome headdress of gold and he had donned a beautiful\r\nembroidered fighting robe, a tʻang-ni helmet and breast plate, and\r\nround his waist was a mang belt with a lion’s head clasp. With spear\r\nset he rode close behind his master.\r\n\r\nTing Yüan, pointing his finger at Tung Cho, began to revile him.\r\n\r\n“Unhappy indeed was this State when the eunuchs became so powerful that\r\nthe people were as if trodden into the mire under their feet. Now you,\r\ndevoid of the least merit, dare to talk of deposing the rightful\r\nEmperor and setting up another. This is to desire rebellion and no\r\nless.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho could not reply for Lü Pu, eager for the fight, rode straight\r\nat him. Tung Cho fled and Ting’s army came on. The battle went in their\r\nfavour and the beaten men retired and made another camp. Here Tung Cho\r\ncalled his officers to a council.\r\n\r\n“This Lü Pu is a marvel,” said Tung Cho. “If he was only on my side I\r\nwould defy the whole world.”\r\n\r\nAt this a man advanced saying, “Be content, O my lord! I am a fellow\r\nvillager of his and know him well, his bravery, his stupidity, his\r\ncupidity and unscrupulousness. With this little, blarneying tongue of\r\nmine I can persuade him to put up his hands and come over to your\r\nside.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho was delighted and gazed admiringly at the speaker, on Li Su a\r\nminor officer of his army.\r\n\r\n“What arguments will you use with him?”\r\n\r\n“You have a fine horse, the Hare, one of the best ever bred. I must\r\nhave this steed, and gold and pearls to win his heart. Then will I go\r\nand persuade him. He will certainly abandon Ting Yüan’s service for\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“What think you?” said Tung Cho to his adviser Li.\r\n\r\n“One cannot grudge a horse to win an empire,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo they gave the corrupter of morals what he demanded—a thousand taels\r\nof gold, ten strings of beautiful pearls and a jewelled belt, and these\r\naccompanied Li Su on his visit to his fellow villager. He reached the\r\ncamp and said to the guard, “Please tell General Lü that a very old\r\nfriend has come to visit him.”\r\n\r\nHe was admitted forthwith.\r\n\r\n“Worthy brother, have you been well since we last met?”\r\n\r\n“How long it is since we last saw each other!” replied Pu, bowing in\r\nreturn. “And where are you now?”\r\n\r\n“I am an officer in the Tiger Company. When I learned you were a strong\r\nsupporter of the throne I could not say how I rejoiced. I have come now\r\nto present to you a really fine horse, a thousand li a day horse, one\r\nthat crosses rivers and goes up mountains as if they were the level\r\nplain. He is called The Hare. He will be a fitting aid to your valour.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu bade them lead out the horse. He was of a uniform colour like\r\nglowing charcoal; not a hair of another colour. He measured ten feet\r\nfrom head to tail and from hoof to neck eight feet. When he neighed the\r\nsound filled the empyrean and shook the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mark ye the steed swift and tireless, see the dust, spurned by\r\n                                           his hoofs, rising in clouds;\r\n    Now he swims the river, anon climbs the hill, rending the purple\r\n                                                          mist asunder;\r\n    Scornful he breaks the rein, shakes from his head the jewelled\r\n                                                                bridle;\r\n    He is as a fiery dragon descending from the highest heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nPu was delighted with the horse and said, “What return can I hope to\r\nmake for such a creature?”\r\n\r\n“What return can I hope for? I came to you out of a sense of what is\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nWine was brought in and they drank.\r\n\r\n“We have seen very little of each other, but I am constantly meeting\r\nyour honourable father,” said Li Su.\r\n\r\n“You are drunk,” said Pu. “My father has been dead for years.”\r\n\r\n“Not so; I spoke of Ting Yüan, the man of the day.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu started. “Yes, I am with him but only because I can do no\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, your talent is higher than the heavens, deeper than the seas. Who\r\nin all the world does not bow before your name? Fame and riches and\r\nhonours are yours for the taking. And you say you can do no better than\r\nremain a subordinate!”\r\n\r\n“If I could only find a master to serve!” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“The clever bird chooses the branch whereon to perch; the wise servant\r\nselects the master to serve. Seize the chance when it comes, for\r\nrepentance ever comes too late.”\r\n\r\n“Now you are in the government. Who think you is really the bravest of\r\nall?”, asked Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“I despise the whole lot except Tung Cho. He is one who respects wisdom\r\nand reveres scholarship; he is discriminating in his rewards and\r\npunishments. Surely he is destined to be a really great man.”\r\n\r\n“I would that I could serve him, but there is no way, I fear.”\r\n\r\nThen Su produced his pearls and gold and the jewelled belt and laid\r\nthem out before his host.\r\n\r\n“What is this? What does it mean?” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“Send away the attendants,” said Li Su. And he went on, “Tung Cho has\r\nlong respected your valour and sent these by my hand. The Hare was also\r\nfrom him.”\r\n\r\n“But, if he loves me like this, what can I do in return?”\r\n\r\n“If a stupid fellow like me can be an officer in The Tigers, it is\r\nimpossible to say what honours await you.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I can offer him no service worth mentioning.”\r\n\r\n“There is one service you can do, and an extremely easy one to perform;\r\nbut you would not render that.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu pondered long in silence. Then he said, “I might slay Ting Yüan\r\nand bring over his soldiers to Tung Cho’s side; what think you of\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“If you would do that, there could be no greater service. But such a\r\nthing must be done quickly.”\r\n\r\nAnd Lü Pu promised his friend that he would do the deed and come over\r\non the morrow.\r\n\r\nSo Li Su took his leave. That very night, at the second watch, Lü Pu\r\nentered, sword in hand, into his master’s tent. He found Ting Yüan\r\nreading by the light of a solitary candle. Seeing who came in he said,\r\n“My son, what is afoot?”\r\n\r\n“I am a bold hero,” said Pu, “do you think I am willing to be a son of\r\nyours?”\r\n\r\n“Why this change, Fêng-hsien?”\r\n\r\nAs a reply Lü Pu made one cut at his protector and his head fell to the\r\nearth. Then he called the attendants and said, “He was an unjust man\r\nand I have slain him. Let those who back me stay; the others may\r\ndepart.”\r\n\r\nMost ran away. Next day, with the head of the murdered man as his gift,\r\nLü Pu betook himself to Li Su, who led him to Tung Cho. Cho received\r\nhim with a warm welcome and had wine set before him.\r\n\r\n“Your coming is welcome as the gentle dew to the parched grass,” said\r\nTung Cho.\r\n\r\nLü Pu made Cho seat himself and then made his obeisance, saying, “Pray\r\nlet me bow to you as my adopted father.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho gave his newly won ally gold and armour and silken robes and\r\nspread the feast of welcome. They then separated.\r\n\r\nThence Tung Cho’s power and influence increased rapidly. He gave ranks\r\nof nobility to his brother and Lü Pu, who were leaders of the two\r\nwings, he himself being leader of the centre. The adviser Li Ju never\r\nceased from urging him to carry out the design of deposing the young\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nThe now all-powerful general prepared a banquet in the capital at which\r\nall the officers of State were guests. He also bade Lü Pu post a\r\ncompany of armed men right and left ready for action. The feast began\r\nand several courses were served with nothing to distinguish that\r\nbanquet from any other. Then suddenly the host arose and drew his\r\nsword, saying, “He who is above us being weak and irresolute is unfit\r\nfor the duties of his high place. Wherefore I, as of old did I Yin and\r\nHo Kuang, will set aside this Emperor giving him the title of Prince\r\nHung-nung and I will place on the throne the present Prince of\r\nChʻên-liu. And those who do not support me will suffer death.”\r\n\r\nFear seized them in its grip and they were silent, all but Yüan Shao\r\nwho said that the Emperor was innocent of any fault and to set him\r\naside in favour of a commoner was rebellion and nothing else.\r\n\r\n“The Empire is in my hands;” cried Cho, “an I choose to do this thing\r\nwho will dare say nay? Think you my sword lacks an edge?”\r\n\r\n“If your sword is sharp, mine is never blunt,” said Shao as his sword\r\nflashed out of the sheath.\r\n\r\nThe two men stood face to face amid the feasters:\r\n\r\n\r\n        When Ting by treacherous murder died,\r\n        The loss was great to Yüan’s side.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of Yüan Shao will be disclosed in later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITION OF THE EMPEROR: PRINCE OF CHʻÊN-LIU BECOMES EMPEROR:\r\nSCHEMES AGAINST TUNG CHO: MÊNG-TÊ PRESENTS A SWORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that Tung Cho was on the point of slaying Yüan Shao, but\r\nhis adviser checked him, saying, “You must not kill rashly while the\r\nbusiness hangs in the balance.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao, his sword still unsheathed, left the assembly. He hung up\r\nthe symbols of his office at the east gate and went to Ichow.\r\n\r\nTung Cho said to the Tʻai-fu Yüan Wei, “Your nephew behaved improperly\r\nbut I pardon him for your sake; what think you of my scheme?”\r\n\r\n“What you think is right,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“If any one opposes the great scheme he will be dealt with by military\r\nlaw,” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\nThe ministers, thoroughly cowed, promised obedience and the feast came\r\nto an end. Tung asked Chou Pi and Wu Chiung what they thought of the\r\nflight of Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\n“He left in a state of great anger. In such a state of excitement much\r\nharm may ensue to the present state of affairs, especially as the Yüan\r\nfamily have been noted for their kindness to the people for four\r\ngenerations, and their protégés and dependents are everywhere. If they\r\nassemble bold spirits and call up their clients, all the valiant\r\nwarriors will be in arms and Shantung will be lost. You had better\r\npardon him and give him a post. He will be glad at being forgiven and\r\nwill do no harm.”\r\n\r\nWu said, “Shao is fond of scheming, but he fails in decision and so is\r\nnot to be feared. But it would be well to give him rank and thus win\r\npopular favour.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho followed this advice and thereupon sent a messenger to offer\r\nYüan Shao the command of Pohai.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth month the Emperor was invited to proceed to the Hall of\r\nAbounding Virtue where was a great assembly of officials. There Tung\r\nCho, sword in hand, faced the gathering and said, “The Emperor is a\r\nweakling unequal to the burden of ruling this land. Now listen ye to\r\nthe document I have prepared.”\r\n\r\nAnd Li Ju read as follows:—“The dutiful Emperor Ling too soon left his\r\npeople. The Emperor is the cynosure of all the people of this land.\r\nUpon the present Emperor Heaven has conferred but small gifts: in\r\ndignity and deportment he is deficient and in mourning he is remiss.\r\nOnly the most complete virtue can grace the imperial dignity. The\r\nEmpress Mother has trained him improperly and the whole State\r\nadministration has fallen into confusion. The Empress Dowager, Jung-lê,\r\ndied suddenly and no one knew why. The doctrine of the three bonds and\r\nthe continuity of celestial and terrestrial interdependence have both\r\nbeen injured. But Hsieh, Prince of Chʻên-liu, is sage and virtuous\r\nbeside being of handsome exterior. He conforms to all the rules of\r\npropriety, his mourning is sincere; his speech is always correct.\r\nEulogies of him fill the Empire. He is well fitted for the great duty\r\nof consolidating the rule of Han.\r\n\r\n“Now therefore the Emperor is deposed and created Prince Hung-nung and\r\nthe Empress Dowager retires from the administration.\r\n\r\n“I pray the Prince to accept the throne in conformity with the decrees\r\nof Heaven, the desires of men and the fulfilment of the hopes of\r\nmankind.”\r\n\r\nThis having been read Tung Cho bade the attendants lead the Emperor\r\ndown from the throne, remove his seal and cause him to kneel facing the\r\nnorth, styling himself minister and requesting commands. Moreover he\r\nbade the Empress Dowager strip off her dress of ceremony and await the\r\nimperial command. Both victims of this oppression wept and every\r\nminister present was deeply affected. One put his discontent into\r\nwords, crying, “The false Tung Cho is the author of this insult, which\r\nI will risk my life to wipe away.” And with this he rushed at Tung Cho\r\nthreatening him with his ivory bâton of office.\r\n\r\nIt was the President Ting Kuan and he was removed and summarily put to\r\ndeath. While he lived he ceased not to rail at the oppressor, nor was\r\nhe frightened at death.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The rebel Tung conceived the foul design\r\n        To thrust the King aside and wrong his line.\r\n        With folded arms the courtiers stood, save one\r\n        Ting Kuan, who dared to cry that wrong was done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the Emperor designate went to the upper part of the hall to\r\nreceive congratulations. After this the late Emperor, his mother and\r\nthe Lady in waiting Tʻang were removed to the Palace of Perpetual Calm.\r\nThe entrance gates were locked against all comers.\r\n\r\nIt was pitiful! There was the young Emperor, after reigning less than\r\nhalf a year, deposed and another put in his place. The new Emperor was\r\nHsieh, the second son of the late Emperor and the name under which he\r\nreigned is Hsien. He was nine years of age and the reign-style was\r\nchanged to Chʻu-Pʻing or The Inauguration of Tranquillity.\r\n\r\nAs chief minister Tung Cho was arrogant beyond all reason. When he\r\nbowed before the throne he did not declare his name; in going to court\r\nhe did not hasten. Booted and armed he entered the reception halls.\r\nNever had such a thing been seen before. Li Ju impressed upon him\r\nconstantly to employ men of reputation so that he should gain public\r\nesteem. So when they told him Chʻai Yung was a man of talent he was\r\nsummoned. But he would not go. Cho sent a message to him that if he did\r\nnot come he and his whole clan should be exterminated. Then Chʻai gave\r\nin and appeared. Cho was very gracious to him and promoted him thrice\r\nin a month. He became a Shih-chung and seemed to be on most friendly\r\nterms with the tyrant.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the deposed ruler, his mother and the Lady Tʻang were immured\r\nin the palace and found their daily supplies gradually diminishing. The\r\ndeposed Emperor wept incessantly. One day a pair of swallows gliding to\r\nand fro moved him to verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Spring! and the green of the tender grass,\r\n        Flushes with joy as the swallows pass;\r\n        The wayfarers pause by the rippling stream,\r\n        And their eyes with new born gladness gleam;\r\n        With lingering gaze the roofs I see\r\n        Of the palace that one time sheltered me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe messenger, sent by Tung Cho from time to time to the palace for\r\nnews of the prisoners, got hold of this poem and showed it to his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n“So he shows his resentment by writing poems, eh! A fair excuse to put\r\nthem all out of the way,” said Tung.\r\n\r\nLi Ju was sent with ten men into the palace to consummate the foul\r\ndeed. The three were in one of the upper rooms when he arrived. The\r\nEmperor shuddered when the maid announced the visitor’s name.\r\n\r\nPresently Li entered and offered a cup of poisoned wine to the Emperor.\r\nThe Emperor asked what this meant.\r\n\r\n“Spring is the season of blending and harmonious interchange and the\r\nMinister sends a cup of the wine of longevity,” said he.\r\n\r\n“If it be the wine of longevity you may share it too; pledge me first,”\r\nsaid the Empress.\r\n\r\nThen Li became brutally frank.\r\n\r\n“You will not drink!” cried he.\r\n\r\nHe called the men with daggers and cords and bade her look at them.\r\n\r\n“The cup, or these?” said he.\r\n\r\nThen said the Lady Tʻang, “Let the handmaiden drink in place of her\r\nlord. Spare the mother and her son, I pray.”\r\n\r\n“And who may you be to die for a prince?” said Li.\r\n\r\nThen he presented the cup to the Empress once more and bade her drink.\r\n\r\nShe railed against her brother, the feckless Ho Chin, the author of all\r\nthis trouble. She would not drink.\r\n\r\nNext Li approached the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“Let me say farewell to my mother,” begged he, and he did so in these\r\nlines:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The heaven and earth are changed alas! the sun and the moon leave\r\n                                                         their courses,\r\n    I, once the centre of all eyes, am driven to the farthest confines.\r\n    Oppressed by an arrogant minister my life nears its end,\r\n    Everything fails me and vain are my falling tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lady Tʻang sang:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Heaven is to be rent asunder, Mother Earth to fall away;\r\n    I, handmaid of an Emperor, would grieve if I followed him not.\r\n    We have come to the parting of ways, the quick and the dead walk\r\n                                                          not together;\r\n    Alas! I am left alone with the grief in my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had sung these lines they fell weeping into each others’\r\narms.\r\n\r\n“The minister is awaiting my report,” said Li, “and you delay too long.\r\nThink you that there is any hope of succour?”\r\n\r\nThe Empress broke into another fit of railing.\r\n\r\n“The rebel forces us to death, mother and son, and Heaven has abandoned\r\nus. But you, the tool of his crime, will assuredly perish.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Li grew more angry, laid hands on the Empress and threw her\r\nout of the window. Then he bade the soldiers strangle Lady Tʻang and\r\nforced the lad to swallow the wine of death.\r\n\r\nHe reported the achievement of the cruel deed to his master who bade\r\nthem bury the victims without the city. After this Tung’s behaviour was\r\nmore atrocious than before. He spent his nights in the palace, defiled\r\nthe virgins there and even slept on the imperial couch.\r\n\r\nOnce he led his soldiers out of the city to Yangchʻêng when the\r\nvillagers, men and women, were assembled from all sides for the annual\r\nfestival. His men surrounded the place and plundered it. They took away\r\nbooty by the cart load, and women prisoners and a large number of\r\nheads. The procession returned to the city and published a story that\r\nthey had obtained a great victory over some rebels. They burned the\r\nheads beneath the walls and the women and jewellery were shared out\r\namong the soldiers.\r\n\r\nAn officer named Wu Fou was disgusted at this ferocity and sought a\r\nchance to slay the tyrant. He constantly wore a breastplate underneath\r\nhis court dress and carried concealed a sharp dagger. One day when Tung\r\ncame to court Fou met him on the steps and tried to stab him. But Cho\r\nwas a very powerful man and held him off till Lü Pu came to his help.\r\nHe struck down the assailant.\r\n\r\n“Who told you to rebel?” said Tung.\r\n\r\nFou glared at him and cried, “You are not my prince, I am not your\r\nminister: where is the rebellion? Your crimes fill the heavens and\r\nevery man would slay you. I am sorry I cannot tear you asunder with\r\nchariots to appease the wrath of the world.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho bade them take him out and hack him to pieces. He only ceased\r\nrailing as he ceased to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Men praise Wu Fou, that loyal servant of the latter days of Han.\r\n    His valour was high as the Heavens, in all ages unequalled;\r\n    In the court itself would he slay the rebel, great is his fame!\r\n    Throughout all time will men call him a hero.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter Tung Cho always went well guarded.\r\n\r\nAt Pohai Yüan Shao heard of Tung Cho’s misuse of power and sent a\r\nsecret letter to Wang Yü.\r\n\r\n“That rebel Cho outrages Heaven and has deposed his ruler. Men cannot\r\nbear to speak of him. Yet you suffer his aggressions as if you knew\r\nnaught of them. How then are you a dutiful and loyal minister? I have\r\nassembled an army and desire to sweep clean the royal habitation, but I\r\ndare not lightly begin the task. If you are willing, then find an\r\nopportunity to plot against this man. If you would use force I am at\r\nyour command.”\r\n\r\nThe letter arrived but Wang Yün could see no chance. One day while\r\namong the throng in attendance, mostly men of long service, he said to\r\nhis colleagues, “This is my birthday, I pray you come to a little party\r\nin my humble cot this evening.”\r\n\r\n“We certainly will,” they cried, “and wish you long life.”\r\n\r\nThat night the tables were spread in an inner room and his friends\r\ngathered there. When the wine had made a few rounds the host suddenly\r\ncovered his face and began to weep.\r\n\r\nThe guests were aghast.\r\n\r\n“Sir, on your birthday too, why do you weep?” said they.\r\n\r\n“It is not my birthday,” replied he. “But I wished to call you together\r\nand I feared lest Tung Cho should suspect, so I made that the excuse.\r\nThis man insults the Emperor and does as he wishes so that the imperial\r\nprerogatives are in imminent peril. I think of the days when our\r\nillustrious founder destroyed Tsʻin, annihilated Chʻu and obtained the\r\nEmpire. Who could have foreseen this day when that Tung Cho has\r\nsubjugated all to his will? That is why I weep.”\r\n\r\nThen they all wept with him.\r\n\r\nSeated among the guests, however, was Tsʻao Tsʻao, who did not join in\r\nthe weeping but clapped his hands and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n“If all the officers of the government weep till dawn, and from dawn\r\nweep till dark, will that slay Tung Cho?” said he.\r\n\r\nHis host turned on him angrily.\r\n\r\n“Your forbears ate of the bounty of the Hans; do you feel no gratitude?\r\nYou can laugh?”\r\n\r\n“I laughed at the absurdity of an assembly like this being unable to\r\ncompass the death of one man. Foolish and incapable as I am I will cut\r\noff his head and hang it at the gate as an offering to the people.”\r\n\r\nThe host left his seat and went over to Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“These later days,” Tsʻao continued, “I have bowed my head to Tung Cho\r\nwith the sole desire of finding a chance to destroy him. Now he begins\r\nto trust me and so I can approach him sometimes. You have a ‘seven\r\nprecious’ sword which I would borrow and I will go into his palace and\r\nkill him. I care not if I die for it.”\r\n\r\n“What good fortune for the world that this is so!” said the host.\r\n\r\nWith this he himself poured out a goblet for his guest who drained it\r\nand swore an oath. After this the sword was brought out and given to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao who hid it under his dress. He finished his wine, took\r\nleave of the guests and left the hall. Before long the others\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nSoon after Tsʻao Tsʻao, with this short sword girded on, came to the\r\npalace of the minister.\r\n\r\n“Where is the minister?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“In the small guest room,” replied the attendants.\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao Tsʻao went in and found his host seated on a couch, Lü Pu was\r\nat his side.\r\n\r\n“Why so late, Mêng-tê?” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\n“My horse is out of condition and slow,” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nCho turned to his henchman.\r\n\r\n“Some good horses have come in from the west. You go and pick out a\r\ngood one as a present for him.” And Lü Pu left.\r\n\r\n“He is doomed,” thought Tsʻao Tsʻao. He ought to have struck then, but\r\nTsʻao knew Cho was very powerful and he was afraid; he wanted to make\r\nsure of his blow.\r\n\r\nNow Tung Cho’s corpulence was such that he could not remain long\r\nsitting, so he rolled over and lay face inwards. “Now is the time,”\r\nthought the assassin, and he gripped the good sword firmly. But just as\r\nhe was going to strike, his victim happened to look up and in a mirror\r\nhe saw the reflection of Tsʻao Tsʻao behind him with a sword in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing, Mêng-tê?” said he turning suddenly. And at that\r\nmoment Lü Pu came along leading a horse.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao in a flurry dropped on his knees and said, “I have a choice\r\nsword here which I wish to present to Your Benevolence.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho took it. It was a fine blade, over a foot in length, inlaid\r\nwith the seven precious signs and very keen; a fine sword in very\r\ntruth. He handed the weapon to Lü Pu while Tsʻao Tsʻao took off the\r\nsheath which he also gave to Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nThen they went out to look at the horse. Tsʻao Tsʻao was profuse in his\r\nthanks and said he would like to try him. So Cho bade them bring saddle\r\nand bridle. Tsʻao led the creature outside, lept into the saddle, laid\r\non his whip vigorously and galloped away eastward.\r\n\r\nLü Pu said, “Just as I was coming up it seemed to me as if that fellow\r\nwas going to stab you, only a sudden panic seized him and he presented\r\nthe weapon instead.”\r\n\r\n“I suspected him too,” said Cho. Just then Li Ju came in and they told\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“He has no family here but lodges quite alone and not far away,” said\r\nhe. “Send for him. If he comes forthwith the sword was meant as a gift,\r\nbut if he makes any excuses he had bad intentions. And you can arrest\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThey sent four prison warders to call Tsʻao Tsʻao. They were absent a\r\nlong time and then came back saying Tsʻao Tsʻao had not returned to his\r\nlodging but had ridden in hot haste out of the eastern gate. To the\r\ngate-warden’s questions he had replied that he was on a special message\r\nfor the minister. He had gone off at full speed.\r\n\r\n“His conscience pricked him and so he fled; there is no doubt that he\r\nmeant assassination,” said Li Ju.\r\n\r\n“And I trusted him so well!” said Tung Cho in a rage.\r\n\r\n“There must be a conspiracy afoot: when we catch him we shall know all\r\nabout it,” said Li Ju.\r\n\r\nLetters and pictures of the fugitive were sent everywhere with orders\r\nto catch him. A large reward in money was offered and a patent of\r\nnobility, while those who sheltered him would be held to share his\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao travelled in hot haste toward Chʻiaochün. On the road at\r\nChungmou he was recognised by the guards at the gate and made prisoner.\r\nThey took him to the magistrate. Tsʻao declared he was a merchant,\r\nnamed Huangfu. The magistrate scanned his face most closely and\r\nremained in deep thought.\r\n\r\nPresently he said, “When I was at the capital seeking a post I knew you\r\nas Tsʻao Tsʻao, why do you try to conceal your identity?”\r\n\r\nHe ordered him to the prison till the morrow when he could be sent to\r\nthe capital and the reward claimed. He gave the soldiers wine and food\r\nas a reward.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight he sent a trusty servant to bring the prisoner into his\r\nprivate rooms for interrogation.\r\n\r\n“They say the Minister treated you well; why did you try to harm him?”\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\n“How can swallows and sparrows understand the flight of the crane and\r\nthe wild goose? I am your prisoner and am to be sent to the capital for\r\na reward. Why so many questions?”\r\n\r\nThe official sent away the attendants and turning to the prisoner said,\r\n“Do not despise me. I am no mere hireling, only I have not yet found\r\nthe lord to serve.”\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao Tsʻao, “My ancestors enjoyed the bounty of the Hans and\r\nshould I differ from a bird or a beast if I did not desire to repay\r\nthem with gratitude? I have bowed the knee to Tung Cho that thereby I\r\nmight find an opportunity against him, and so remove this evil from the\r\nState. I have failed for this time. Such is the will of heaven.”\r\n\r\n“And where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Home to my village. Thence I shall issue a summons calling all the\r\nbold spirits to come with forces to kill the tyrant. This is my\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the magistrate himself loosened the bonds of the prisoner,\r\nled him to the upper seat and bowed saying, “I am called Chʻên Kung. My\r\naged mother and family are in the east. I am deeply affected by your\r\nloyalty and uprightness and I will abandon my office and follow you.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was delighted with this turn of affairs. The magistrate at\r\nonce collected some money for the expenses of their journey and gave\r\nhis prisoner a different dress. Then each took a sword and rode away\r\ntoward the home of Tsʻao. Three days later at eventide they reached\r\nChʻêngkao. Tsʻao Tsʻao pointed with his whip to a hamlet deep in the\r\nwoods and said, “There lives my uncle, Lü Po-shê, a sworn-brother of my\r\nfather. Suppose we go and ask news of my family and seek shelter for\r\nthe night?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said his companion and they rode over, dismounted at the\r\nfarm gate and entered.\r\n\r\nTheir host said, “I hear the government has sent stringent orders on\r\nall sides to arrest you. Your father has gone into hiding to Chʻên Lu.\r\nHow has this all come about?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao told him and said, “Had it not been for this man here with\r\nme I should have been already hacked to pieces.”\r\n\r\nPo-shê bowed low to Chʻên Kung saying, “You are the salvation of the\r\nTsʻao family. But be at ease and rest, I will find you a bed in my\r\nhumble cottage.”\r\n\r\nHe then rose and went into the inner chamber where he stayed a long\r\ntime. When he came out, he said, “There is no good wine in the house, I\r\nam going over to the village to get some for you.”\r\n\r\nAnd he hastily mounted his donkey and rode away. The two travellers sat\r\na long time. Suddenly they heard at the back of the house the sound of\r\nsharpening a knife.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said, “He is not my real uncle; I am beginning to doubt the\r\nmeaning of his going off. Let us listen.”\r\n\r\nSo they silently stepped out into a straw hut at the back. Presently\r\nsome one said, “Bind before killing, eh?”\r\n\r\n“As I thought;” said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “now unless we strike first we shall\r\nbe taken.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly they dashed in, sword in hand, and slew the whole household\r\nmale and female; in all eight persons.\r\n\r\nAfter this they searched the house. In the kitchen they found a pig\r\nbound ready to kill.\r\n\r\n“You have made a huge mistake,” said Chʻên Kung, “and we have slain\r\nhonest folk.”\r\n\r\nThey at once mounted and rode away. Soon they met their host coming\r\nhome and over the saddle in front of him they saw two vessels of wine.\r\nIn his hands he carried fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\n“Why are you going, Sirs?” he called to them.\r\n\r\n“Accused people dare not linger,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“But I have bidden them kill a pig! Why do you refuse my poor\r\nhospitality? I pray you ride back with me.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao paid no heed. Urging his horse forward he suddenly drew his\r\nsword and rode after Lu.\r\n\r\n“Who is that coming along?”\r\n\r\nLu turned and looked back and Tsʻao at the same instant cut him down.\r\n\r\nHis companion was frightened.\r\n\r\n“You were wrong enough before,” cried he. “What now is this?”\r\n\r\n“When he got home and saw his family killed, think you he would bear it\r\npatiently? If he had raised an alarm and followed us we should have\r\nbeen killed.”\r\n\r\n“To kill deliberately is very wrong,” said Chʻên Kung.\r\n\r\n“I would rather betray the world then let the world betray me,” was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nChʻên Kung only thought. They rode on some distance by moonlight and\r\npresently knocked up an inn for shelter. Having first fed their horses,\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was soon asleep, but his companion lay thinking.\r\n\r\n“I took him for a true man and left all to follow him, but he is cruel\r\nas a wolf. If I spare him he will do more harm,” thought Chʻên.\r\n\r\nAnd he rose intending to kill his companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In his heart lie cruelty and venom, he is no true man;\r\n    In nought doth he differ from his enemy Tung Cho.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe further fortunes of Tsʻao Tsʻao will be told in later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSENDING OUT THE CALL: MANY RESPOND:\r\nDESTROYING AN ARMY: THE THREE BROTHERS FIGHT AGAINST LÜ PU.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last chapter Tsʻao Tsʻao’s companion was about to\r\nslay him. But the memory of why he had decided to join his fortunes\r\nwith his companion’s stayed his hand. Rising from his bed before dawn\r\nhe mounted his horse and rode away toward his home in the east. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao awoke with the day and missed his companion. Thought he, “He\r\nthinks me brutal because of a couple of egoistic phrases I used and so\r\nhe has gone. I ought to push on too and not linger here.”\r\n\r\nSo he travelled as quickly as possible toward home. When he saw his\r\nfather he related what had happened and said he wanted to dispose of\r\nall the property and enlist soldiers with the money.\r\n\r\n“Our possessions are but small”; said his father, “and not enough to do\r\nanything with. However, there is a graduate here, one Wei Hung,\r\ncareless of wealth but careful of virtue, whose family is very rich.\r\nWith his help we might hope for success.”\r\n\r\nA feast was prepared and the rich man invited. Tsʻao made him a\r\nspeech:—“The Hans have lost their lordship and Tung Cho is really a\r\ntyrant. He flouts his prince and is cruel to the people, who gnash\r\ntheir teeth with rage. I would restore the Hans but my means are\r\ninsufficient. Sir, I appeal to your loyalty and public-spirit.”\r\n\r\nHe replied, “I have long desired this but, so far, have not found a man\r\nfit to undertake the task. Since you, Mêng-tê, have so noble a desire I\r\nwillingly devote all my property to the cause.”\r\n\r\nThis was joyful news and the call to arms was forthwith prepared and\r\nsent far and near. So they established a corps of volunteers and set up\r\na large white recruiting banner with the words “Loyalty and Right”\r\ninscribed thereon. The response was rapid and volunteers came in like\r\nrain drops in number.\r\n\r\nOne day came a certain Yo Chin, whose minor name was Wên-chʻien, and\r\nanother Li Tien, also known as Man-chʻêng. These two were appointed to\r\nTsʻao’s personal staff. Another was one Hsiahou Tun. He was descended\r\nfrom Hsiahou Ying and had been trained from his early boyhood to use\r\nthe spear and the club. When only fourteen he had been attached to a\r\ncertain master-in-arms. One day some one spoke disrespectfully of his\r\nmaster and Tun killed him. For this deed, however, he had to flee and\r\nhad been an exile for some time. Now he came to offer his services,\r\naccompanied by his brother. Each brought a company of trained men.\r\n\r\nReally these two were brothers of Tsʻao Tsʻao by birth since his father\r\nwas originally of the Hsiahou family, and had only been adopted into\r\nthe Tsʻao family.\r\n\r\nA few days later came two other brothers, Tsʻao Jên and Tsʻao Hung,\r\neach with a company. These two were accomplished horsemen and trained\r\nin the use of arms. Then drill began and Wei Hung spent his treasure\r\nfreely in buying clothing, armour, flags and banners. From all sides\r\npoured in gifts of grain.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan Shao received Tsʻao Tsʻao’s call to arms he collected all\r\nthose under his command to the number of three legions. He came to take\r\nthe oath to Tsʻao. Next a manifesto was issued:—\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao and his associates, moved by a sense of duty, now make this\r\nproclamation. Tung Cho defies heaven and earth. He is destroying the\r\nState and injuring his prince. He pollutes the palace and oppresses the\r\npeople. He is vicious and cruel. His crimes are heaped up. Now we have\r\nreceived a secret command to call up soldiers and we are pledged to\r\ncleanse the Empire and destroy the evil-doers. We will raise a\r\nvolunteer army and exert all our efforts to maintain the dynasty and\r\nsuccour the people. Respond to this, O Nobles, by mustering your\r\nsoldiers.”\r\n\r\nMany from every side answered the summons as the following list shows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Prefect of Nanyang, Yüan Shu.\r\n    The Governor of Ichow, Han Fu.\r\n    The Governor of Yüchow, Kʻung Yu.\r\n    The Governor of Yenchow, Liu Tai.\r\n    The Prefect of Honei, Wang Kʻuang.\r\n    The Prefect of Chʻên-liu, Chang Mo.\r\n    The Prefect of Tungchun, Chiao Mao.\r\n    The Prefect of Shanyang, Yüan I.\r\n    The Hsiang of Chipei, Pao Hsin.\r\n    The Prefect of Peihai, Kʻung Yung.\r\n    The Prefect of Kuangling, Chang Chʻao.\r\n    The Governor of Hsüchow, Tʻao Chʻien.\r\n    The Prefect of Hsiliang, Ma Tʻêng.\r\n    The Prefect of Peipʻing, Kungsun Tsan.\r\n    The Prefect of Shangtang, Chang Yang.\r\n    The Prefect of Chʻangsha, Sun Chien.\r\n    The Prefect of Pohai, Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese contingents varied in size, but each was complete in itself with\r\nits officers, civil and military, and battle-leaders, and they\r\nassembled at Loyang.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of Peipʻing, Kungsun Tsan, while on his way with his force\r\nof a legion and a half, passed through Pʻingyüan. There he saw among\r\nthe mulberry trees a yellow flag under which marched a small company.\r\nWhen they drew nearer he saw the leader was Liu Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“Good brother, what do you here?”\r\n\r\n“You were kind to me once and on your recommendation I was made\r\nmagistrate of this district. I heard you were passing through and came\r\nto salute you. May I pray my elder brother to enter into the city and\r\nrest his steed?”\r\n\r\n“Who are these two?” said Tsan pointing to the other two brothers.\r\n\r\n“These are Kuan Yü and Chang Fei, my sworn brothers.”\r\n\r\n“Were they fighting with you against the rebels?”\r\n\r\n“All my success was due to their efforts,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“And what offices do they fill?”\r\n\r\n“Kuan Yü is a mounted archer: Fei is a foot archer.”\r\n\r\n“Thus are able men buried!” said Tsan, sighing. Then he continued. “All\r\nthe highest in the land are now going to destroy the rebellious Tung\r\nCho. My brother would do better to abandon this petty place and join us\r\nin restoring the House of Han. Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I should like to go,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“If you had let me kill him that other time you would not have this\r\ntrouble to-day,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“Since things are so let us pack and go,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nSo without more ado the three brothers, with a few horsemen, joined\r\nKungsun Tsan and marched with him to join the great army.\r\n\r\nOne after another the feudal lords came up and encamped. Their camps\r\nextended over three hundred li and more. When all had arrived Tsʻao, as\r\nthe head, prepared sacrificial bullocks and horses and called all the\r\nlords to a great assembly to decide upon their plan of attack.\r\n\r\nThen spake the Prefect Wang saying “We have been moved by a noble sense\r\nof right to assemble here. Now must we first choose a chief and bind\r\nourselves to obedience.”\r\n\r\nThen said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “For four generations the highest offices of\r\nstate have been filled by members of the Yüan family and his clients\r\nand supporters are everywhere. As a descendant of ancient ministers of\r\nHan, Yüan Shao is a suitable man to be our chief lord.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao again and again declined this honour. But they all said, “It\r\nmust be he; there is no other.” And then he agreed.\r\n\r\nSo a three-storeyed altar was built and they planted about it the five\r\nbanners of the divisions of space. And they set up white yaks’ tails\r\nand golden axes and emblems of military authority and the seals of\r\nleadership round about.\r\n\r\nAll being ready the chief lord was invited to ascend the altar. Clad in\r\nceremonial robes and girt with a sword, Yüan Shao reverently ascended.\r\nThere he burned incense, made obeisance and recited the oath:—\r\n\r\n“The House of Han has fallen upon evil days, the bands of imperial\r\nauthority are loosened. The rebel minister, Tung Cho, takes advantage\r\nof the discord to work evil, and calamity falls upon honourable\r\nfamilies. Cruelty overwhelms simple folk. We, Shao and his\r\nconfederates, fearing for the safety of the imperial prerogatives, have\r\nassembled military forces to rescue the State. We now pledge ourselves\r\nto exert our whole strength and act in concord to the utmost limit of\r\nour powers. There must be no disconcerted or selfish action. Should any\r\ndepart from this pledge may he lose his life and leave no posterity.\r\nAlmighty Heaven and Universal Mother Earth and the enlightened spirits\r\nof our forefathers, be ye our witnesses.”\r\n\r\nThe reading finished, he smeared the blood of the sacrifice upon his\r\nlips and upon the lips of those who shared the pledge. All were deeply\r\naffected by the ceremony and many shed tears.\r\n\r\nThis done the oath-chief was supported down from the high place and led\r\nto his tent, where he took the highest place and the others arranged\r\nthemselves according to rank and age. Here wine was served.\r\n\r\nPresently Tsʻao Tsʻao said, “It behoves us all to obey the chief we\r\nhave this day set up, and support the State. There must be no feeling\r\nof rivalry or superiority based upon numbers.”\r\n\r\nShao replied, “Unworthy as I am, yet as elected chief I must\r\nimpartially reward merit and punish offences. Let each see to it that\r\nhe obeys the national laws and the army precepts. These must not be\r\nbroken.”\r\n\r\n“Only thy commands are to be obeyed,” cried all.\r\n\r\n“My brother, Yüan Shu, is appointed Chief of the Commissariat. He must\r\nsee to it that the whole camp is well supplied. But the need of the\r\nmoment is a van-leader who shall go to Ssŭshui Pass and provoke a\r\nbattle. The other forces must take up positions in support.”\r\n\r\nThen the Prefect of Chʻangsha offered himself for this service.\r\n\r\n“You are valiant and fierce, and equal to this service,” said Yüan\r\nShao.\r\n\r\nThe force under Sun Chien set out and presently came to the Pass. The\r\nguard there sent a swift rider to the capital to announce to the tyrant\r\nthe urgency of the situation.\r\n\r\nEver since Tung Cho had secured his position he had given himself up to\r\nluxury without stint. When the urgent news reached the adviser Li Ju,\r\nhe at once went to his master, who much alarmed called a great council.\r\n\r\nLü Pu stood forth and said, “Do not fear, my father, I look upon all\r\nthe lords without the Pass as so much stubble and with the men of our\r\nfierce army I will put every one of them to death and hang their heads\r\nat the gates of the capital.”\r\n\r\n“With your aid I can sleep secure,” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\nBut some one behind Lü Pu broke in upon his speech saying “A butcher’s\r\nknife to kill a chicken! There is no need for the Marquis to go: I will\r\ncut off their heads every one as easily as I would take a thing out of\r\nmy pocket.”\r\n\r\nCho looked up and his eyes rested on a stalwart man of fierce mien,\r\nlithe and supple. He had a small round head like a leopard and\r\nshoulders like an ape’s. His name was Hua Hsiung. Cho rejoiced at his\r\nbold words and at once gave him high rank and command over five legions\r\nof horse and foot. He, with Li Su, Hu Chên and Chao Tsʻên hastily moved\r\ntoward the Pass.\r\n\r\nAmong the feudal lords Pao Hsin was jealous lest the chosen van-leader\r\nshould win too great honours. Wherefore he endeavoured to meet the foe\r\nfirst and so he secretly despatched his brother Chung with three\r\ncompanies by a bye-road. As soon as this small force reached the Pass\r\nthey offered battle. Hua Hsiung at the head of half a company of\r\nmail-clad horsemen swept down from the Pass crying “Flee not, rebel.”\r\n\r\nBut Pao Chung was afraid and turned back. Hsiung came on, his arm rose,\r\nthe sword fell, and Chung was cut down from his horse. Most of his\r\ncompany were captured. His head was sent to the minister’s palace. Hua\r\nHsiung was promoted to Tu-tu, or Commander in Chief.\r\n\r\nSun Chien presently approached the Pass. He had four captains: Chʻêng\r\nPʻu, whose weapon was an iron-spined snaky lance; Huang Kai, who\r\nwielded an iron whip; Han Tang, a swordsman, and Tsu Mou, who fought\r\nwith a pair of swords.\r\n\r\nThe Commander Sun wore a helmet of fine silver wrapped round with a\r\npurple turban. He carried across his body his sword of ancient ingot\r\niron and rode a dappled horse with flowing mane.\r\n\r\nHe advanced to the Pass and hailed the defenders, calling them helpers\r\nof a fool, and summoned them to surrender. A half legion under Hu Chên\r\nwent out against him whom Chʻêng Pʻu with the snaky lance rode out and\r\nengaged. After a very few bouts Hu Chên was killed on the spot by a\r\nthrust through the throat. Then the signal was given for the main army\r\nto advance. But from the Pass they rained down showers of stones, which\r\nproved too much for the assailants and they retired into camp at\r\nLiangtung to await further help from Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\nAn urgent message for supplies was sent to the commissary. But one said\r\nto him, the Controller: “This Sun Chien is a very tiger. Should he take\r\nthe capital and destroy Tung Cho we should have a tiger in place of a\r\nwolf. Do not send him grain. Starve his men and that will decide the\r\nfate of that army.”\r\n\r\nAnd Yüan Shu gave ear to the detractors and sent no grain or forage.\r\nSoon the hungry soldiers showed their disaffection by indiscipline and\r\nthe spies bore the news to the defenders of the Pass, who decided upon\r\na speedy attack in front and rear. They hoped to capture the Sun Chien.\r\n\r\nSo the soldiers of the attacking face were told off and given a full\r\nmeal. At dark they left the Pass and crept by secret paths to the rear\r\nof Sun Chien’s camp. The moon was bright and the wind cool. They\r\narrived about midnight and the drums beat an immediate attack. Sun\r\nChien hastily donned his fighting gear and rode out. He ran straight\r\ninto Hua Hsiung and the two warriors engaged. But before they had\r\nexchanged many passes Li Su’s men came up and set fire to whatever\r\nwould burn.\r\n\r\nSun’s army were thrown into confusion and fled like rats. A general\r\nmêlée ensued and soon only Tsu Mou was left at his chief’s side. These\r\ntwo broke through the pass and fled. Hua Hsiung coming in hot pursuit,\r\nSun Chien took his bow and let fly two arrows in quick succession, but\r\nboth missed. He fitted a third arrow to the string, but drew the bow so\r\nfiercely that it snapped. He cast the magpie painted bow to the earth\r\nand set off at full gallop.\r\n\r\nThen spake Tsu Mou saying, “My lord’s purple turban is a mark that the\r\nrebels will too easily recognise. Give it to me and I will wear it.”\r\n\r\nSo Sun Chien exchanged his silver helmet with the turban for his\r\nfaithful friend’s headpiece, and the two men parted, riding different\r\nways. The pursuers looking only for the purple turban went after its\r\nwearer and Sun escaped along a bye-road.\r\n\r\nTsu Mou, hotly pursued, then tore off the headdress which he hung on\r\nthe post of a half-burned house as he passed and dashed into the thick\r\nwoods. Hua Hsiung’s men seeing the purple turban standing motionless\r\ndared not approach, but they surrounded it on every side and shot at it\r\nwith arrows. Presently they discovered the trick, went up and seized\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis was the moment that the hidden man awaited. At once he rushed\r\nforth, his two swords whirling about, and dashed at the leader. But Hua\r\nHsiung was too quick. With a loud yell he slashed at Tsu Mou and cut\r\nhim down. Day had now broken and the victor led his men back to the\r\nPass.\r\n\r\nThe three other leaders in time met their chief and the soldiers\r\nhalted. Sun Chien was much grieved at the loss of his generous\r\nsubordinate.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the disaster reached Yüan Shao he was greatly chagrined\r\nand called all the lords to a council. They assembled and Kungsun Tsan\r\nwas the last to arrive. When all were seated in the tent Yüan Shao\r\nsaid, “The brother of General Pao, disobeying the rules we made for our\r\nguidance, rashly went to attack the enemy; he was slain and with him\r\nmany of our soldiers. Now Sun Wên-tʻai has been defeated. Thus our\r\nfighting spirit has suffered and what is to be done?”\r\n\r\nEvery one was silent. Lifting his eyes the chief looked round from one\r\nto another till he came to Kungsun Tsan and then he remarked three men\r\nwho stood behind his seat. They were of striking appearance as they\r\nstood there, all three smiling cynically.\r\n\r\n“Who are those men behind you?” said the chief.\r\n\r\nKungsun told Yüan-tê to come forward, and said, “This is Liu Pei,\r\nmagistrate of Pʻingyüan and a brother of mine who shared my humble\r\ncottage.”\r\n\r\n“It must be the Liu Yüan-tê who broke up the Yellow Turban rebellion,”\r\nsaid Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“It is he,” said his patron and he ordered Liu Pei to make his\r\nobeisance to the assembly, to whom he then related his services and his\r\norigin, all in full detail.\r\n\r\n“Since he is of the Han line he should be seated,” said the chief and\r\nhe bade Liu Pei sit.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei modestly thanked him.\r\n\r\nSaid Shao, “This consideration is not for your fame and office; I\r\nrespect you as a scion of the imperial family.”\r\n\r\nSo Liu Pei took his seat in the lowest place of the long line of lords.\r\nAnd his two brothers with folded arms took their stations behind him.\r\n\r\nEven as they were at this meeting came in a scout to say that Hua\r\nHsiung with a company of mail-clad horsemen was coming down from the\r\nPass. They were flaunting Sun Chien’s captured purple turban on the end\r\nof a bamboo pole. The enemy was soon hurling insults at those within\r\nthe stockade and challenging them to fight.\r\n\r\n“Who dares go out to give battle?” said the chief.\r\n\r\n“I will go,” said Yü Shê, a leader who belonged to the train of Yüan\r\nShu.\r\n\r\nSo he went and almost immediately one came back to say that he had\r\nfallen in the third bout.\r\n\r\nFear began to lay its cold hand on the assembly. Then said another, “I\r\nhave a brave warrior among my men. Pʻan Fêng is his name and he could\r\nslay this Hua Hsiung.”\r\n\r\nSo Pʻan was ordered out to meet the foe. With his great battle-axe in\r\nhis hand he mounted and rode forth. But soon came the direful tidings\r\nthat he too had fallen. The faces of the gathering paled at this.\r\n\r\n“What a pity my two able leaders, Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou, are not\r\nhere! Then should we have some one who would not fear this man,” said\r\nthe chief.\r\n\r\nHe had not finished when from the lower end a voice cried, “I will go,\r\ntake his head and lay it before you here.”\r\n\r\nAll turned to look at the speaker. He was tall and had a long beard.\r\nHis eyes were those of a phœnix and his eyebrows thick and bushy like\r\ncaterpillars. His face was a swarthy red and his voice deep as the\r\nsound of a great bell.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” asked the chief.\r\n\r\nKungsun Tsan told them it was Kuan Yü, brother of Liu Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“And what is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is in the train of Liu Yüan-tê as a mounted archer.”\r\n\r\n“An insult to us all!” roared the chief’s brother from his place. “Have\r\nwe no leader? How dare an archer speak thus before us? Let us beat him\r\nforth!”\r\n\r\nBut Tsʻao Tsʻao intervened. “Peace, O Kung-lu! Since he speaks great\r\nwords, he is certainly valiant. Let him try. If he fail, then you may\r\nreproach him.”\r\n\r\n“Hua Hsiung will laugh at us if we send a mere archer to fight him,\r\nsaid the chief.”\r\n\r\n“He looks no common person. And how can the enemy know he is but a\r\nbowman?” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“If I fail then can you take my head,” cried Kuan.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao bade them heat some wine and offered a stirrup cup to Kuan\r\nYü as he went out.\r\n\r\n“Pour it out,” said Kuan. “I shall return in a little space.”\r\n\r\nHe went with his sword in his hand and vaulted into the saddle. Those\r\nin the tent heard the fierce roll of the drums and then a mighty sound\r\nas if skies were falling and earth rising, hills trembling and\r\nmountains tearing asunder. And they were sore afraid. And while they\r\nwere listening with ears intent, lo! the gentle tinkle of horse bells,\r\nand Kuan Yü threw at their feet the head of the slain leader, their\r\nenemy Hua Hsiung.\r\n\r\nThe wine was still warm!\r\n\r\nThis doughty deed has been celebrated in verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The power of the man stands first in all the world;\r\n    At the gate of the camp was heard the rolling of the battle drums;\r\n    Then Yün-chʻang set aside the wine cup till he should have\r\n                                                  displayed his valour,\r\n    And the wine was still warm when the enemy had been slain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was pleased at this success. But Chang Fei’s voice was\r\nheard, shouting, “Brother, you slew the leader; why did you not break\r\nthrough the Pass and seize Tung Cho? Could there have been a better\r\ntime?”\r\n\r\nAgain arose the voice of the peevish Yüan Shu, “We high officials are\r\ntoo meek and yielding. Here is the petty follower of a small magistrate\r\ndaring to flaunt his prowess before us! Expel him from the tent, I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\nBut again Tsʻao Tsʻao interposed, “Shall we consider the station of him\r\nwho has done a great service?”\r\n\r\n“If you hold a mere magistrate in such honour then I simply withdraw,”\r\nsaid Yüan Shu.\r\n\r\n“Is a word enough to defeat a grand enterprise?” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHe told Kungsun Tsan to lead his three companions back to their own\r\ncamp and the other chiefs then dispersed. That night he secretly sent\r\npresents of flesh and wine to soothe the three after this adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen Hua Hsiung’s men straggled back and told the story of defeat and\r\ndeath Li Su was greatly distressed. He wrote urgent letters to his\r\nmaster who called in his trusted advisers to a council. Li Ju summed up\r\nthe situation. “We have lost our best leader and the rebel power has\r\nthereby become very great. Yüan Shao is at the head of this confederacy\r\nand Yüan Wei of the same family is holder of high office in the\r\ngovernment. If those in the capital combine with those in the country\r\nwe may suffer. Therefore we must remove them. So I request you, Sir\r\nMinister, to place yourself at the head of your army and break this\r\nconfederation.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho agreed and at once ordered Li Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ to take half a\r\ncompany and surround the residence of Yüan Wei, the Tʻai-fu, slay every\r\nsoul, and hang the head of the high officer outside the gate as a\r\ntrophy. And Cho commanded twenty legions to advance in two armies. The\r\nfirst five legions were under Li Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ and they were to\r\nhold Ssŭshui Pass. They should not necessarily fight. The other fifteen\r\nlegions under Tung Cho himself went to Tigertrap Pass.\r\n\r\nThis Pass is fifty li from Loyang and as soon as they arrived Tung Cho\r\nbade Lü Pu take three legions and make a strong stockade on the outside\r\nof the Pass. The main body with Cho would occupy the Pass.\r\n\r\nNews of this movement reaching the confederate lords the chief summoned\r\na council. Said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “The occupation of the Pass would cut our\r\narmies in two, therefore must we oppose Tung Cho’s army on the way.”\r\n\r\nSo eight of the confederate lords went in the direction of the Pass to\r\noppose their enemy. Tsʻao Tsʻao and his men were a reserve to render\r\nhelp where needed.\r\n\r\nOf the eight, the Prefect of Honei was the first to arrive and Lü Pu\r\nwent to give battle with three companies of mailed horsemen.\r\n\r\nWhen Wang Kʻuang, Prefect of Honei, had ordered his army, horse and\r\nfoot, in battle array he took his station under the great banner and\r\nlooked over at his foe. There he saw Lü Pu, a conspicuous figure in\r\nfront of the line. On his head was a triple curved headdress of ruddy\r\ngold. He wore a robe of Ssŭchʻuan silk embroidered with flowers and\r\nover that breast and back mail adorned with a gaping animal’s head,\r\njoined by rings at the sides and girt to his waist with a belt fastened\r\nby a beautiful lion-head clasp. His bow and arrows were slung on his\r\nshoulders and he carried a trident-halberd (hua-chi). He was seated on\r\nhis snorting steed “The Hare”. Indeed he was the man among men, as his\r\nsteed was the horse among horses.\r\n\r\n“Who dares go out to fight him?” asked Wang Kʻuang turning to those\r\nbehind him. In response a tried warrior named Fang spurred to the\r\nfront, his spear set ready for battle. The two met: before the fifth\r\nbout Fang fell under a thrust of the halberd and Lü Pu dashed forward.\r\nWang Kʻuang’s men could not stand and scattered in all directions. Lü\r\nPu went to and fro slaying all he met. He was quite irresistible.\r\n\r\nHappily two other troops came up and rescued the wounded leader and his\r\nopponent retreated. The three having lost many men withdrew thirty li\r\nand made a stockade. And before long the remaining five lords came up\r\nand joined them. They held a council.\r\n\r\n“This Lü Pu is irresistible,” said they.\r\n\r\nAnd while they sat there anxious and uncertain, it was announced that\r\nLü Pu had returned to challenge them. Each mounted his horse and placed\r\nhimself at the head of his force, each body in its station on lofty\r\ncliffs. Around them was the opposing army, innumerable horse and foot,\r\ntheir embroidered banners waving in the breeze.\r\n\r\nThey attacked. Mu Shun, a leader from Shangtang, rode out, but fell at\r\nthe first encounter with Lü Pu. This frightened the others. Then\r\ngalloped forth Wu An-kuo of the iron mace. Lü Pu whirling his halberd\r\nand urging on his steed came to meet him. The two fought, well matched\r\nfor half a score bouts, when a blow from the halberd broke Wu An-kuo’s\r\nwrist. Letting his mace fall to the ground he fled. Then all eight of\r\nthe lords led forth their men to his rescue and Lü Pu retired.\r\n\r\nThe fighting then ceased and after their return to camp another council\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said, “No one can stand against the prowess of Lü Pu. Let\r\nus call up all the lords and evolve some good plan. If only Lü Pu were\r\ntaken, his master could easily be killed.”\r\n\r\nWhile the council was in progress again came Lü Pu to challenge them\r\nand again they moved out against him. This time Kungsun Tsan,\r\nflourishing his spear, went to meet the enemy. After a very few bouts\r\nTsan turned and fled, Lü Pu following at the topmost speed of “The\r\nHare.”\r\n\r\n“The Hare” was a thousand-li-a-day horse, swift as the wind. As they\r\nwatched “The Hare” gained rapidly upon the flying horseman and his\r\nrider’s spear was poised ready to strike Tsan just behind the heart.\r\nJust then dashed in a third rider with round glaring eyes and a\r\nbristling moustache, and armed with a long snake-like spear.\r\n\r\n“Stay, O thrice named slave!” roared he, “I, Chang Fei, await you.”\r\n\r\nSeeing this opponent Lü Pu left the pursuit of Tsan and engaged the new\r\nadversary. Fei fought with all his energies. They two were worthily\r\nmatched and they exchanged half a hundred bouts with no advantage to\r\neither side. Then Kuan Yü rode out with his huge and weighty\r\nmoon-curved sword and attacked Lü Pu on the other flank. The three\r\nsteeds stood like the letter T and their riders battered away at each\r\nother for nearly two score bouts, yet still Lü Pu stood firm. Then Liu\r\nYüan-tê rode out to his brothers’ aid, his double sword raised ready to\r\nstrike. The steed with the flowing mane was urged in at an angle and\r\nnow Lü Pu had to contend with three warriors at whom he struck one\r\nafter another, and they at him, the flashing of the warriors’ weapons\r\nlooking like the revolving lamps suspended at the new year. And the\r\nspectators gazed rapt with amazement at such a battle.\r\n\r\nBut Lü Pu’s guard began to weaken and fatigue seized him. Looking hard\r\nin the face of Yüan-tê he feigned a fierce thrust thus making him\r\nsuddenly draw back. Then, lowering his halberd, Lü dashed through the\r\nangle thus opened and got away.\r\n\r\nBut was it likely they would allow him to escape? They whipped their\r\nsteeds and followed hard. The men of the eight armies cracked their\r\nthroats with thunderous cheers and all dashed forward, pressing after\r\nLü Pu as he made for the shelter of the Pass. And first among his\r\npursuers were the three heroic brothers.\r\n\r\nAn ancient poet has told of this famous fight in these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fateful day of Han came in the reigns of Huan and Ling,\r\n    Their glory declined as the sun sinks at the close of day.\r\n    Tung Cho, infamous minister of state, pulled down the youthful\r\n                                             sovereign from his throne.\r\n    It is true Liu Hsieh was a weakling, too timid for his times.\r\n    Then Tsʻao Tsʻao proclaimed abroad these wicked deeds,\r\n    And the great lords, moved with anger, assembled their forces.\r\n    In council met they and chose as their oath-chief Yüan Shao,\r\n    Pledged themselves to maintain the ruling house and tranquillity.\r\n    Of the warriors of that time peerless Lü Pu was the boldest\r\n    His valour and prowess are sung by all within the four seas.\r\n    He clothed his body in silver armour like the scales of a dragon,\r\n    On his head was a golden headdress, fastened with a massive pin,\r\n    About his waist a shaggy belt, the clasp, two wild beasts’ heads\r\n                                                    with gripping jaws,\r\n    His flowing, broidered robe fluttered about his form,\r\n    His swift courser bounded over the plain, a mighty wind following,\r\n    His terrible halberd flashed in the sunlight, bright as a placid\r\n                                                                  lake.\r\n    Who dared face him as he rode forth to challenge?\r\n    The bowels of the confederate lords were torn with fear and their\r\n                                           hearts trembled within them.\r\n    Then leaped forth Chang Fei, the valiant warrior of the north,\r\n    Gripped in his mighty hand the long snakelike spear,\r\n    His moustache bristled with anger, standing stiff like wire.\r\n    His round eyes glared, lightning flashes darted from them.\r\n    Neither quailed in the fight, but the issue was undecided.\r\n    Kuan Yün-chʻang stood out in front, his soul vexed within him,\r\n    Black Dragon his sword shone white as hoar frost in the sunlight,\r\n    His bright coloured fighting robe fluttered like butterfly wings,\r\n    Demons and angels shrieked at the thunder of his horse hoofs,\r\n    In his eyes was fierce anger, a fire to be quenched only in blood.\r\n    Next Yüan-tê joined the battle, gripping his twin sword blades,\r\n    The heavens themselves trembled at the majesty of his wrath.\r\n    These three closely beset Lü Pu and long drawn out was the battle,\r\n    Always he warded their blows, never faltering a moment.\r\n    The noise of their shouting rose to the sky, and the earth\r\n                                                          re-echoed it,\r\n    The heat of battle ranged to the frozen pole star.\r\n    Worn out, feeling his strength fast ebbing, Lü Pu thought to flee,\r\n    He glanced at the hills around and thither would fly for shelter.\r\n    Then, reversing his halberd and lowering its lofty point,\r\n    Hastily he fled, loosing himself from the battle;\r\n    With head low bent, he gave the rein to his courser,\r\n    Turned his face away and fled to Hulaokuan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three brothers maintained the pursuit to the Pass. Looking up they\r\nsaw an immense umbrella of black gauze fluttering in the west wind.\r\n\r\n“Certainly there is Tung Cho,” cried Chang Fei. “What is the use of\r\npursuing Lü Pu? Better far seize the chief rebel and so pluck up the\r\nevil by the roots.”\r\n\r\nAnd he whipped up his steed toward the Pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To quell rebellion seize the leader if you can;\r\n    If you need a wondrous service then first find a wondrous man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following chapters will unfold the result of the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBURNING THE CAPITAL, TUNG CHO COMMITS AN ATROCITY:\r\nHIDING THE SEAL, SUN CHIEN BREAKS FAITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nChang Fei rode hard up to the Pass but the defenders sent down stones\r\nand arrows like rain so that he could not enter and he returned. The\r\neight lords all joined in felicitations to the three heroes for their\r\nservices and the story of victory was sent to Yüan Shao, who ordered\r\nSun Chien to advance.\r\n\r\nThereupon Sun with two trusty friends went over to the camp of Yüan\r\nShu. Tracing figures on the ground with his staff Sun Chien said, “Tung\r\nCho and I had no personal quarrel. Yet now I have thrown myself into\r\nthe battle regardless of consequences, exposed my person to the risk of\r\nwounds and fought bloody battles to their bitter end. And why? That I\r\nmight be the means of ridding my country of a rebel and—for the private\r\nadvantage of your family. Yet you, heeding the slanderous tongues of\r\ncertain enemies, formerly withheld the supplies absolutely necessary to\r\nme, and so I suffered defeat. How can you explain, General?”\r\n\r\nYüan Shu, confused and frightened, had no word to reply. He ordered the\r\ndeath of the slanderers to placate Sun.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly they told Sun, “Some officer has come riding down from\r\nthe Pass to see you, General; he is in the camp.”\r\n\r\nSun Chien therefore took his leave and returned to his own camp where\r\nhe found the visitor was an officer, much beloved of Tung Cho, named Li\r\nTsʻui.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore come you?” said Chien.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “You are the one person for whom my master has respect and\r\nadmiration, and he sends me to arrange a matrimonial alliance between\r\nthe two families. He wishes that his daughter may become the wife of\r\nyour son.”\r\n\r\n“What! Tung Cho, that rebel and renegade, that subverter of the throne!\r\nWould that I could destroy his nine generations as a thank-offering to\r\nthe Empire! Think you I would be willing to have an alliance with such\r\na family? I will not slay you as I ought, but go, and go quickly! Yield\r\nthe Pass and I may spare your lives. If you delay I will grind your\r\nbones to powder and make mincemeat of your flesh.”\r\n\r\nLi Tsʻui threw his arms over his head and ran out. He returned to his\r\nmaster and told him what a rude reception he had met with. Cho asked\r\nhis adviser Li Ju how to reply to this and he said that as Lü Pu’s late\r\ndefeat had somewhat blunted the edge of his desire for battle it would\r\nbe well to return to the capital and remove the Emperor to Chʻangan, as\r\nthe street boys had been lately singing:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        “A Han on the west, a Han on the east.\r\n        The deer will be safe in Chʻangan, poor beast.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLi continued “If you think out this couplet it applies to the present\r\njuncture. Half the first line refers to the founder of the dynasty, who\r\nbecame ruler in the western city, which was the capital during twelve\r\nreigns. The other half corresponds to Kuang-Wu who ruled from Loyang,\r\nthe capital during twelve later reigns. The revolution of the heavens\r\nbrings us to this moment and if the minister remove to Chʻangan there\r\nwill be no need for anxiety.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho was exceedingly pleased and said, “Had you not spoken thus I\r\nshould not have understood.”\r\n\r\nThen taking Lü Pu with him he started at once for the capital. Here he\r\ncalled all the officials to a great council in the palace and addressed\r\nthem thus:—\r\n\r\n“After two centuries of rule here the royal fortune has been exhausted\r\nand I perceive that the aura of rule has migrated to Chʻangan, whither\r\nI now desire to move the court. All you had better pack up for the\r\njourney.”\r\n\r\nThe minister Yang Piao said, “I pray you reflect. Within that city all\r\nis destruction. There is no reason to renounce the ancestral temples\r\nand abandon the imperial tombs here. I fear the people will be alarmed.\r\nIt is easy to alarm them but difficult to pacify them.”\r\n\r\n“Do you oppose the State plans?” said Cho angrily.\r\n\r\nAnother official, Huang Yüan, supported his colleague, “In the\r\nrebellion of Wang Mang, in the days of Kêng Shih and Fan Chʻung of the\r\nRed Eyebrows, the city was burned and became a place of broken tiles.\r\nThe inhabitants scattered all but a few. It is wrong to abandon these\r\npalaces for a desert.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho replied, “East of the Pass is full of sedition and all the\r\nEmpire is in rebellion. The city of Chʻangan is protected by Yaohan and\r\nvery near Shênsi, whence can be easily brought building material. In a\r\nmonth or so palaces can be erected. So an end to your wild words!”\r\n\r\nYet another raised a protest against disturbing the people but the\r\ntyrant overbore him also.\r\n\r\n“How can I stop to consider a few common people when my scheme affects\r\nthe Empire?”\r\n\r\nThat day the three objectors were degraded to the rank of ordinary\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAs Cho went out to get into his coach he met two other officers who\r\nmade obeisance. They were the President, Chou Pi, and the Captain of\r\nthe City Gate, Wu Chʻing. Cho stopped and asked them what they wanted.\r\nSaid the former, “We venture to try to dissuade you from moving the\r\ncapital to Chʻangan.”\r\n\r\nCho replied, “They used to say you two were supporters of Yüan Shao;\r\nnow he has already turned traitor and you are of the same party.”\r\n\r\nAnd without more ado he bade his guards take both outside the city and\r\nput them to death.\r\n\r\nThe command to remove to the new capital immediately was issued. On the\r\nadvice of Li Ju, who pointed out that money was short and the rich\r\npeople of Loyang could be easily plundered and that it was a good\r\noccasion to remove the supporters of their opponents, Cho sent five\r\ncompanies out to plunder and slay. They captured very many wealthy folk\r\nand, having stuck flags on their heads saying they were traitors and\r\nrebels, drove them out of the city and put them to death. Their\r\nproperty was all seized.\r\n\r\nThe task of driving forth the inhabitants, some millions, was given to\r\ntwo of Tung Cho’s creatures. They were sent off in bands of a hundred,\r\neach band between two parties of soldiers, who urged them forward.\r\nEnormous numbers fell by the road side and died in the ditches, and the\r\nescort plundered the fugitives and defiled the women. A wail of sorrow\r\narose to the very sky. The tyrant’s final orders as he left were to\r\nburn the whole city, houses, palaces and temples, and everything was\r\ndevoured by the flames. The capital became but a patch of scorched\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nTung Cho sent Lü Pu to desecrate the tombs of the Emperors and their\r\nconsorts for the jewels therein, and the common soldiers took the\r\noccasion to dig up the graves of officers and plunder the cemeteries of\r\nthe wealthy. The spoil of the city, gold and silver, pearls and silks,\r\nand beautiful ornaments, filled many carts and with these and the\r\npersons of the Emperor and his household Tung Cho moved off to the new\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe city being thus abandoned the commander at Ssŭshui Pass evacuated\r\nthat post of vantage, which Sun Chien at once occupied. The three\r\nbrothers took Tigertrap Pass and the confederate lords advanced.\r\n\r\nSun Chien hastened to the late capital which was still in flames. When\r\nhe arrived dense smoke hung all over it and spread for miles around. No\r\nliving thing, not a fowl, or a dog, or a human being, remained. Sun\r\ntold off his men to extinguish the fires and set out camping places for\r\nthe confederate lords.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao went to see the chief and said, “Tung has gone west; we\r\nought to follow and attack without loss of time; why do you remain\r\ninactive?”\r\n\r\n“All our colleagues are worn out and there is nothing to be gained by\r\nattack,” said Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao urged him to strike a blow for the moment was most\r\npropitious in the utter confusion that reigned, palaces burned, the\r\nEmperor abducted, the whole world upset and no one knowing whither to\r\nturn. But all the confederate lords seemed of one mind and that mind\r\nwas to postpone action. So they did nothing. However, Tsʻao Tsʻao and\r\nhis subordinates, with a full legion of soldiers, started in pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe road to the new capital led through Jungyang, and when the\r\ncavalcade reached it the Prefect went to welcome Tung Cho. Li Ju said,\r\n“As there is some danger of pursuit it would be well to order the\r\nPrefect of this place to lay an ambush ready to cut off the retreat of\r\nour pursuers when our army beats them off. That will teach any others\r\nnot to follow.”\r\n\r\nThen Lü Pu was ordered to command the rear guard. Very soon they saw\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao coming up and Lü Pu laughed at his colleague’s foresight.\r\nHe set out his men in fighting order.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao rode forward crying, “Rebels, abductors, drovers of the\r\npeople, where are you going?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu replied, “Treacherous simpleton, what mad words are these?”\r\n\r\nThen from Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army rode against him Hsiahou Tun with his\r\nspear set and they two engaged. The combat had hardly begun when Li\r\nTsʻui with a cohort came in from the left. Tsʻao Tsʻao bade Hsiahou\r\nYüan meet this onslaught. However, on the other side appeared Kuo Ssŭ,\r\nagainst whom was sent Tsʻao Jên. The onrush on three sides was too much\r\nto withstand and Lü Pu showed no signs of being vanquished, so Hsiahou\r\nTun had to retire to the main line. Thereupon Lü Pu’s mail-clad men\r\nattacked and completed the defeat. The beaten men turned toward\r\nJungyang.\r\n\r\nThey got as far as the foot of a bare hill in the second watch, about\r\nnine in the evening, and the moon made it as light as day. Here they\r\nhalted to reform. Just as they were burying the boilers to prepare a\r\nmeal there arose a great noise of shouting on all sides and out came\r\nthe men from the ambush fresh to attack.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao, thrown into a flurry, mounted and fled. He ran right in\r\nthe way of the waiting Prefect. Then he dashed off in another\r\ndirection, but the Prefect shot an arrow after him which struck him in\r\nthe shoulder. The arrow still in the wound, he fled for his life. As he\r\nwent over the hill two soldiers lying in wait among the grass suddenly\r\ndashed out and wounded his horse, which fell and rolled over, and as\r\nits rider slipped from the saddle he was seized and made prisoner.\r\n\r\nJust then a horseman riding at full speed and whirling his sword came,\r\nup, cut down both the captors and rescued Tsʻao Tsʻao. It was his\r\nbrother Tsʻao Hung.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said, “I am doomed, good brother, go and save yourself.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, mount my horse quickly; I will go afoot,” said Hung.\r\n\r\n“If those wretches come up, what then?”\r\n\r\n“The world can do without me, but not without you, my brother.”\r\n\r\n“If I live I shall owe you my life,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nSo he mounted. His brother tore off his own breastplate, gripped his\r\nsword and went on foot after the horse. Thus they proceeded till the\r\nfourth watch when they saw before them a broad stream, and behind they\r\nstill heard the shouts of pursuers drawing nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\n“This is my fate;” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. “I am really doomed.”\r\n\r\nHis brother helped him down from his horse. Then taking off his\r\nfighting robe he took the wounded man on his back and waded into the\r\nstream. When they reached the further side the pursuers had already\r\ngained the bank whence they shot arrows. Tsʻao Tsʻao all wet pushed on.\r\n\r\nDawn was near. They went on another thirty li and then sat down to rest\r\nunder a precipice. Suddenly loud shouting was heard and a party of\r\nhorse appeared. It was the Prefect of Jungpang who had forded the river\r\nhigher up. Just at this moment Hsiahou Tun and his brother, with a half\r\nscore men, came along.\r\n\r\n“Hurt not my lord!” cried Hsiahou to the Prefect, who at once rushed at\r\nhim. But the combat was short. The Prefect speedily fell under a spear\r\nthrust and his men were driven off. Before long Tsʻao Tsʻao’s other\r\ncaptains arrived. Sadness and joy mingled in the greetings. They\r\ngathered together the few hundreds of men left and then returned to\r\nHonei.\r\n\r\nThe story broke off leaving the confederate lords in their various\r\ncamps at Loyang. Sun Chien, after extinguishing the fires, camped\r\nwithin the walls, his own tent being set up near the Chienchang Hall of\r\nthe palace. His men cleared away the débris and closed the rifted\r\ntombs. The gates were barred. On the site of the Dynastic Temple he put\r\nup a mat shed containing three apartments, and here he begged the lords\r\nto meet and replace the sacred tablets, with solemn sacrifices and\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony over, the others left and Sun Chien returned to his camp.\r\nThat night the stars and moon vied with each other in brightness. As\r\nSun sat in the open air looking up at the heavens he noticed a mist\r\nspreading over the stars of the Constellation Draco.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor’s stars are dulled,” said he with a sigh, “No wonder a\r\nrebellious minister disturbs the State, the people sit in dust and\r\nashes, and the capital is a waste.”\r\n\r\nAnd his tears began to fall. Then a soldier pointing to the south said,\r\n“There is a beam of coloured light rising from a well.”\r\n\r\nHe bade his men light torches and descend into the well. Soon they\r\nbrought up the corpse of a woman, not in the least decayed although it\r\nhad been there many days. She was dressed in palace clothing and from\r\nher neck hung an embroidered bag. Opening this a red box was found,\r\nwith a golden lock, and when the box was opened they saw a jade seal,\r\nsquare in shape, an inch each way. On it were delicately engraved five\r\ndragons intertwined. One corner had been broken off and repaired with\r\ngold. There were eight characters in the seal style of engraving which\r\ninterpreted read, “I have received the command from Heaven: may my time\r\nbe always prosperous.”\r\n\r\nSun Chien showed this to Chʻêng Pʻu who at once recognised it as the\r\nhereditary seal of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nHe said, “This seal has a history. In olden days one Pʻien Ho saw a\r\nphœnix sitting on a certain stone at the foot of Ching Hill. He offered\r\nthe stone at court. King Wên of Chʻu split open the stone and found a\r\npiece of jade. Early in the Tsʻin dynasty a jade cutter made a seal\r\nfrom it and Li Ssŭ engraved the characters. Two years later it was\r\nthrown overboard in a terrific storm on the Tungtʻing Lake as a\r\npropitiatory offering, and the storm immediately ceased. Ten years\r\nlater again, when the Emperor was making a progress and had reached\r\nHuaying, an old man by the road side handed a seal to one of the\r\nattendants saying, “This is now restored to the ancestral dragon,” and\r\nhad then disappeared. Thus the jewel returned to Tsʻin. The next year\r\nEmperor Shê died.”\r\n\r\n“Later Tzŭ-ying presented the seal to the founder of the Han dynasty.\r\nIn Wang Mang’s rebellion the Emperor struck two of the rebels with the\r\nseal and broke off a corner, which was repaired with gold. Kuang-Wu got\r\npossession of it at Iyang and it has been regularly bequeathed\r\nthereafter. I heard it had been lost during the trouble in the palace\r\nwhen ‘The Ten’ hurried off the Emperor. It was missed on His Majesty’s\r\nreturn. Now my lord has it and certainly will come to the imperial\r\ndignity. But you must not remain here. Quickly go east where you can\r\nlay plans for the accomplishment of the great design.”\r\n\r\n“Your words exactly accord with my thoughts,” said Sun Chien.\r\n“To-morrow I will make an excuse that I am unwell and get away.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were told to keep the discovery a secret. But who could\r\nguess that one among them was a compatriot of the elected chief of the\r\nconfederacy? He thought this might be of great advantage to him so he\r\nstole away out of the camp and betrayed his master. He received a\r\nliberal reward and Yüan Shao kept him in his own camp. So when Sun\r\nChien came to take leave saying “I am rather unwell and wish to return\r\nto Changsha,” Shao laughed saying “I know what you are suffering from;\r\nit is called the Hereditary Seal!”\r\n\r\nThis was a shock to Sun Chien and he paled but he said, “Whence these\r\nwords?”\r\n\r\nShao said, “The armies were raised for the good of the State and to\r\nrelieve it from oppression. The seal is State property and since you\r\nhave got hold of it you should publicly hand it over to me as chief.\r\nWhen Tung Cho has been slain it must go back to the government. What do\r\nyou mean by concealing it and going away?”\r\n\r\n“How could the seal get into my hands?”\r\n\r\n“Where is the article out of the well?”\r\n\r\n“I have it not: why harass me thus?”\r\n\r\n“Quickly produce it, or it will be the worse for you.”\r\n\r\nSun Chien pointing toward the heavens as an oath said, “If I have this\r\njewel and am hiding it myself may my end be unhappy and my death\r\nviolent!”\r\n\r\nThe lords all said, “After an oath like this we think he cannot have\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThen Shao called out his informant. “When you pulled that thing out of\r\nthe well, was this man there?” asked he of Sun.\r\n\r\nSun Chien’s anger burst forth and he sprang forward to kill the man.\r\nThe chief also drew his sword saying “You touch that soldier and it is\r\nan insult to me.”\r\n\r\nIn a moment on all sides swords flew from their scabbards. But the\r\nconfusion was stayed by the efforts of the others and Sun Chien left\r\nthe assembly. Soon he broke up his camp and marched to his own place.\r\n\r\nThe chief was not satisfied. He wrote to Chingchou and sent the letter\r\nby a trusty hand to tell the governor to stop Sun Chien and take away\r\nthe seal.\r\n\r\nJust after this came the news of the defeat and misfortune of Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao and when he was coming home Shao sent out to welcome him and\r\nconduct him into camp. They also prepared a feast to console him.\r\nDuring the feast Tsʻao Tsʻao said sadly, “My object was for the public\r\ngood and all you gentlemen nobly supported me. My plan was to get Yüan\r\nShu with his Honei men to approach Mêngching and Suantsao while the\r\nothers of you held Chʻêng-kao and took possession of the granaries and\r\nguarded Taku, and so controlled the points of vantage. Yüan Shao was to\r\noccupy Tanshi and go into Wukuan to help the three supports, all were\r\nto fortify their positions and not fight. Advantage lay in an uncertain\r\nmilitary force showing the Empire’s possibilities of dealing with the\r\nrebellion. Victory would have been ours at once. But then came delays\r\nand doubts and inaction and the confidence of the people was lost and I\r\nam ashamed.”\r\n\r\nNo reply was possible and the guests dispersed. Tsʻao Tsʻao saw that\r\nthe others mistrusted him and in his heart knew that nothing could be\r\naccomplished, so he led off his force to Yangchou.\r\n\r\nThen Kungsun Tsan said to the three brothers, “This Yüan Shao is an\r\nincapable and things will go agley. We had better go too.”\r\n\r\nSo he broke camp and went north. At Pʻingyüan he left Liu Pei in\r\ncommand and went to strengthen his own position and refresh his men.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of Yenchou wished to borrow grain of the Prefect of\r\nTungchun. Being denied he attacked the camp, killed the leader and took\r\nover all his men. Yüan Shao seeing the confederacy breaking up also\r\nmarched away and went east.\r\n\r\nNow the Governor of Chingchou, Liu Piao, was a scion of the imperial\r\nhouse. As a young man he had made friends with many famous persons and\r\nhe and his companions were called the Eight Dilettanti. The other seven\r\nwere Chʻên Hsiang, Fan Pʻang, Kʻung Yu, Fan Kʻang, Tʻan Fu, Chang Chien\r\nand Tsʻên Ching. He was friends with all these. He had three famous men\r\nwho helped him in the government of his district. They were Kʻuai\r\nLiang, Kʻuai Yüeh and Tsʻai Mao.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter detailing the fault of Sun Chien arrived the two Kʻuai\r\nand Tsʻai were sent with a legion of soldiers to bar the way. When Sun\r\nChien drew near the force was arranged in fighting order and the\r\nleaders were in the front.\r\n\r\n“Why are you thus barring the road with armed men?” asked Sun.\r\n\r\n“Why do you, a minister of Han, secrete the Emperor’s special seal?\r\nLeave it with me at once and you go free,” said Kʻuai Yüeh.\r\n\r\nSun Chien angrily ordered out a leader Huang Kai, who exchanged a few\r\nbouts with Tsʻao Mao and presently dealt him a blow with the iron whip\r\njust over the heart. Mao turned his steed and fled and Sun Chien got\r\nthrough with a sudden rush.\r\n\r\nHowever, there arose the sound of gongs and drums on the hills behind\r\nand there was Prefect Liu in person with a large army. Sun Chien rode\r\nstraight up to him and bowing low spoke thus. “Why did you, on the\r\nfaith of a letter from Yüan Shao, try to coerce the chief of a\r\nneighbouring district?”\r\n\r\n“You have concealed the State jewel and I want you to restore it,” was\r\nLiu’s reply.\r\n\r\n“If I have this thing may I die a violent death!”\r\n\r\n“If you want me to believe you let me search your baggage.”\r\n\r\n“What force have you that you dare come to flout me thus?”\r\n\r\nAnd only the Prefect’s prompt retirement prevented a battle.\r\n\r\nSun Chien proceeded on his way. But from the rear of the second hill an\r\nambush suddenly discovered itself and Kʻuai and Tsʻai were still\r\nfollowing. Sun Chien seemed entirely hemmed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n    What doth it advantage a man to hold the imperial seal if its\r\n    possession lead to strife?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Sun Chien got clear of the difficulty will presently be told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nYÜAN SHAO FIGHTS WITH KUNGSUN TSAN AT PʻANHO:\r\nSUN CHIEN ATTACKS LIU PIAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last chapter Sun Chien was surrounded. However he\r\neventually fought his way through, though with the loss of three of his\r\nbest leaders and more than half his men and he returned to Chiangtung.\r\nHenceforward he and Liu Piao were open enemies.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao was in Honei. Being short of supplies he sent to borrow from\r\nIchou, whence he obtained the wherewithal to support his army. Then his\r\nadviser, Fêng Chi, said to him, “You are really the strongest power\r\nhere about, why then depend upon another for food? Ichou is rich and\r\nwide; why not seize it?”\r\n\r\n“I have no good plan,” replied Yüan.\r\n\r\n“You could secretly send a letter to Kungsun Tsan to attack, promising\r\nhim your support. The Prefect Han Fu being incapable must ask you to\r\ntake over his country and you will get it without lifting a finger.”\r\n\r\nSo the letter was sent, and when Kungsun Tsan saw therein the proposal\r\nto make a joint attack and divide the territory, he agreed to give his\r\nhelp. In the meantime Yüan Shao had sent to warn Han Fu of his danger.\r\nHan sought advice from Hsün Shên and Hsin Pʻing. The former said that\r\nif Kungsun came to attack them they could not stand against him,\r\nespecially if he had the help of Liu and Chang. So he counselled\r\ngetting aid from their powerful neighbour. “Yüan Pên-chʻu is bolder\r\nthan most and he has many able and famous leaders under him. You cannot\r\ndo better than ask him to assist in administering this district. He\r\nwill certainly treat you with generosity and you need have no fear from\r\nKungsun Tsan.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect agreed and sent a message to Yüan Shao. But the commandant\r\nof the palace, Kêng Wu, remonstrated with his master saying, “Yüan Shao\r\nis a needy man with a hungry army and as dependent on us for existence\r\nas an infant in arms on its mother. Stop the flow of milk and the\r\ninfant dies. Why should you hand the district over to him? It is\r\nnothing less than letting a tiger into the sheepfold.”\r\n\r\nHan Fu replied, “I am one of the clients of the Yüan family and I know\r\nthe abilities of Pên-chʻu. Why are you all so jealous? The ancients\r\ncounselled yielding to the sage.”\r\n\r\nKêng Wu sighed, “Ichou is lost!” said he.\r\n\r\nWhen the news got abroad two score of officers of Ichou left their\r\nemployment and the city. However Kêng and Kuan hid in the suburbs to\r\nawait the arrival of Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait. Soon Yüan Shao with his soldiers came and\r\nthe two men tried to assassinate him. This attempt failed. Yen Liang\r\nkilled one of them and Wên Chʻou the other. Thus both died and the\r\nobject of their hatred entered the prefecture.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to confer on Han Fu a high sounding title, but the\r\nadministration was entrusted to four of his own confidants who speedily\r\ndeprived the Prefect of all power. Full of chagrin Han soon abandoned\r\nall, even his family, and took refuge with the Prefect of Chʻên-liu.\r\n\r\nHearing of Shao’s invasion Kungsun Tsan sent his brother, Yüeh, to see\r\nthe usurper and demand his share of the district. The brother was sent\r\nback to request Kungsun himself to come, but on the homeward road he\r\nwas killed by assassins who loudly proclaimed they belonged to the\r\nMinister, Tung Cho. Those of his followers who escaped carried the news\r\nto their late master’s brother.\r\n\r\nKungsun Tsan was very angry and said, “He prevailed on me to attack and\r\nnow he has taken possession. Also he pretends the murderers of my\r\nbrother were not his men. Shall I not avenge my brother’s injury?”\r\n\r\nThen he brought up all his force to the attack. Yüan sent out his army\r\nand they met at Pʻanho. They halted on opposite sides of a stream, over\r\nwhich was a bridge. Kungsun Tsan took his station on the bridge and\r\ncried to his enemy, “Renegade, how dared you mislead me?”\r\n\r\nYüan rode to his end of the bridge and, pointing at Kungsun Tsan,\r\nreplied, “Han Fu yielded place to me because he was unequal to the\r\nrule. What concern is it of yours?”\r\n\r\nKungsun replied, “Formerly you were regarded as loyal and public\r\nspirited and we chose you chief of the confederacy. Now your deeds\r\nprove you cruel and base, wolf-hearted and currish in behaviour. How\r\ncan you look the world in the face?”\r\n\r\n“Who will capture him?” cried Yüan in a rage.\r\n\r\nAt once Wên Chʻou rode out with his spear set. Kungsun Tsan rode down\r\nthe bridge to the enemy’s side, where the two engaged. Half a score\r\nbouts showed Tsan he had met his master so he drew off. The enemy came\r\non. Tsan took refuge within his formation, but Wên Chʻou cut his way in\r\nand rode this way and that, slaying right and left. The four best of\r\nTsan’s captains offered joint battle, but one fell under the first\r\nstroke of the doughty warrior and the other three fled, Wên Chʻou\r\nfollowing clear through to the rear of the army. Kungsun made for the\r\nmountains. Wên Chʻou forced his horse to its utmost pace crying\r\nhoarsely, “Down! Dismount and surrender.”\r\n\r\nKungsun fled for life. His bow and quiver dropped from his shoulders,\r\nhis helmet fell off and his hair streamed straight behind him as he\r\nrode in and out between the sloping hills. Then his steed stumbled and\r\nhe was thrown, rolling over and over to the foot of the slope.\r\n\r\nWên Chʻou was now very near and poising his spear for the thrust. Then\r\nsuddenly came out from the shelter of a grassy mound on the left a\r\nleader of youthful mien, but sitting his steed bravely and holding a\r\nsturdy spear. He rode directly at Wên Chʻou and Kungsun crawled up the\r\nslope to look on.\r\n\r\nThe new warrior was of middle height with bushy eyebrows and large\r\neyes, a broad face and a heavy jowl, a youth of commanding presence.\r\nThe two exchanged some fifty bouts and yet neither had the advantage.\r\nThen Kungsun’s rescue force came along and Wên Chʻou turned and rode\r\naway. The youth did not pursue.\r\n\r\nKungsun Tsan hurried down the hill and asked the young fellow who he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nHe bowed low and replied that his name was Chao Yün, or Tzŭ-lung, and\r\nhe was of Chêngting.\r\n\r\n“I first served Yüan Shao, but when I saw that he was disloyal to his\r\nprince and careless of the welfare of the people I left him and I was\r\non my way to offer service to you. This meeting in this place is most\r\nunexpected.”\r\n\r\nKungsun was very pleased and the two went together to the camp, where\r\nthey at once busied themselves with preparations for a new battle.\r\n\r\nNext day Kungsun prepared for fight by dividing his army into two\r\nportions, like the wings of a bird. He had five thousand cavalry,\r\nnearly all mounted on white horses and because he had formerly seen\r\nservice against the frontier tribes, the Chʻiang (Ouigours) where he\r\nalways placed his white horses in the van of his army, he had won the\r\nsobriquet of General of the White Horse. The tribes held him so much in\r\nfear that they always fled as soon as the white horses appeared.\r\n\r\nOn Yüan Shao’s side Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou were leaders of the van.\r\nEach had a company of archers and crossbowmen. They were set out half\r\non either side, those on the left to shoot at Kungsun Tsan’s right and\r\nthose on the right to shoot at his left. In the centre was Chʻü I with\r\na small company of bowmen and a legion and a half of foot. The chief\r\ntook command of the reserve force in the rear.\r\n\r\nIn this fight Kungsun Tsan employed his new adherent Chao Yün for the\r\nfirst time and, as he did not feel assured of his good faith, put him\r\nin command of a company at the rear. The van-leader was Yen Kang and\r\nKungsun himself commanded the centre. He took his place on horseback on\r\nthe bridge beside an enormous red standard on which was displayed the\r\nword “General” in gold embroidery.\r\n\r\nFrom shên (7 a.m.–9 a.m.) till ssŭ (9 a.m.–11 a.m.) the drums rolled\r\nfor the attack, but Yüan’s army made no move. Chʻü I made his bowmen\r\nhide under their shields. They heard the roar of explosions, the\r\nwhistling of arrows and the rattle of the drums, as Yen Kang approached\r\nfrom the other side, but Chʻü I and his men lay closer than ever and\r\nnever stirred. They waited till Yen Kang had got close on them and\r\nthen, as the sound of a bomb rent the air, the whole company, eight\r\nhundred men, let fly their arrows in a cloud. Yen Kang was quite taken\r\naback and would have retired, but Chʻü I rode furiously toward him,\r\nwhirled up his sword and cut him down. So Kungsun’s men lost that\r\nbattle. The two wings that should have come to the rescue were kept\r\nback by the bowmen under Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou and Yüan’s men\r\nadvanced right up to the bridge. Then Chʻü I rode forward, slew the\r\nstandard bearer and hacked through the staff of the embroidered banner.\r\nSeeing this Kungsun Tsan turned his steed and galloped away.\r\n\r\nChʻü I followed. But just as he caught up the fugitive there came\r\nprancing forth Chao Yün, who rode directly at him with spear ready to\r\nstrike. After a few passes the pursuer was laid in the dust. Then Chao\r\nYün attacked the soldiers and turned the tide. Plunging forward on this\r\nside, dashing in on that, he went through as if there were no\r\nantagonists and, seeing this, Kungsun Tsan turned and came again into\r\nthe fight. The final victory was on his side.\r\n\r\nFrom the men sent to find out how the battle went Yüan Shao heard the\r\ngood news of Chʻü I’s success in slaying the standard bearer, capturing\r\nthe flag and his pursuit. So he took no further care but rode out with\r\nhis captains and a few guards to look on at the defeated enemy and\r\nenjoy his victory.\r\n\r\n“Ha ha!” he laughed. “The poor fool! He is an incapable.”\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke he saw in front the redoubtable Chao Yün. His\r\nguards hastened to prepare their bows, but before they could shoot Chao\r\nwith a few followers was in their midst and men were falling before him\r\nwherever he went. The others fled. Kungsun Tsan’s army then gathered\r\nround and hemmed in Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\nTʻien Fêng then said to his master, “Sir, take refuge in this empty\r\nbuilding here.”\r\n\r\nBut Yüan dashed his helmet to the ground, crying “The brave man rather\r\nfaces death in the battle than seeks safety behind a wall!”\r\n\r\nThis bold speech gave new courage to his men who now fought desperately\r\nand with such success that Chao Yün could nowhere force his way in.\r\nShao was soon reinforced by the arrival of his main body and Yen Liang,\r\nso that Chao Yün could only just get his master safe out of the press.\r\nWhen clear they both returned to the bridge. But Yüan’s men still came\r\non and fought their way across the bridge, forcing multitudes of their\r\nadversaries into the water, where many were drowned.\r\n\r\nYüan was leading in person and his men still advanced. But not very\r\nfar, for soon a great shouting was heard behind some hills, whence\r\nsuddenly burst out a body of men led by the three brothers.\r\n\r\nAt Pʻingyüan they had heard of the struggle between their protector and\r\nhis enemy, Yüan Shao, and had at once set out to help. Now the three\r\nriders, each with his peculiar weapon, flew straight at Yüan, who was\r\nso frightened that his soul seemed to leave his body and fly beyond the\r\nconfines of heaven. His sword fell from his hand and he fled for his\r\nlife. He was chased across the bridge when Kungsun Tsan called in his\r\nmen and they returned to camp.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual greetings Kungsun said, “If you had not come to our\r\nhelp, we should have been in very bad case.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê and Chao Yün were made acquainted with each other and a warm\r\naffection sprang up from the very first so that they were always\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nYüan had lost that battle and Kungsun Tsan would not risk another. He\r\nstrengthened his defences and the armies lay inactive for over a month.\r\nIn the meantime news of the fighting had reached the capital and Tung\r\nCho was told.\r\n\r\nHis adviser, Li Ju, went to see his master and said, “The two active\r\nwarriors of to-day are Yüan Shao and Kungsun Tsan, who are at grips at\r\nPʻanho. Pretend you have a command to make peace between them and both\r\nwill support you out of gratitude for your intervention.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Tung Cho. So he sent a Grand Preceptor and a Court\r\nChamberlain on the mission. When these men were arriving Yüan sent out\r\nto welcome them a hundred li from his headquarters and received the\r\ncommand with the greatest respect. Then the two officers went to\r\nKungsun Tsan and made known their errand. Kungsun sent letters to his\r\nadversary proposing friendship. The two emissaries returned to report\r\ntheir task accomplished. Kungsun drew off his army. He also sent up a\r\nmemorial eulogising Liu Yüan-tê, who was raised in rank.\r\n\r\nThe farewell between Liu Pei and Chao Yün was affecting. They held each\r\nother’s hands a long time, their eyes streaming with tears, and could\r\nnot tear themselves apart.\r\n\r\nChao Yün said with a sob, “I used to think Kungsun noble, but I see now\r\nthat he is no different from Yüan. They are both alike.”\r\n\r\n“But you are in his service, and we shall surely meet again.” said\r\nYüan-tê.\r\n\r\nBoth men wept freely as they separated.\r\n\r\nNow Yüan Shu, hearing that his brother had come into Ichou, sent to beg\r\na thousand horses. The request was refused and enmity sprang up between\r\nthe brothers. He also sent to Chingchow to borrow grain, which Liu Piao\r\nwould not send. In his resentment he wrote to Sun Chien trying to get\r\nhim to attack Liu Piao. The letter ran like this:—\r\n\r\n“When Liu Piao stopped you on your way home it was at the instigation\r\nof my brother. Now the same two have planned to fall upon your\r\ndistrict, wherefore you should at once strike at Liu Piao. I will\r\ncapture my brother for you and both resentments will be appeased. You\r\nwill get Chingchow and I shall have Ichou.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot bear Liu Piao.” said Sun Chien as he finished reading this\r\nletter. “He certainly did bar my way home and I may wait many years for\r\nmy revenge if I let slip this chance.”\r\n\r\nHe called a council.\r\n\r\n“You may not trust Yüan Shu; he is very deceitful,” said Chʻêng Pʻu.\r\n\r\n“I want revenge on my own part; what care I for his help?” said Chien.\r\n\r\nHe despatched Huang Kai to prepare a river fleet, arm and provision\r\nthem. Some craft were to take horses on board. The force soon set out.\r\n\r\nNews of these preparations came to Liu Piao and he hastily summoned his\r\nadvisers and warriors. Kʻuai Liang told him to be free from anxiety,\r\nand said, “Put Huang Tsu at the head of the Chianghsia army to make the\r\nfirst attack and you, Sir, support him. Let Sun Chien come ‘riding the\r\nrivers and straddling the lakes;’ what can he do?”\r\n\r\nSo Huang Tsu was bidden to prepare to march and a great army was\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nHere it may be said that Sun Chien had four sons, all the issue of his\r\nwife who was of the Wu family. Their names were Tsʻê (Po-fu), Chʻüan\r\n(Chung-mou), I (Shu-pi) and Kʻuang (Chi-tso). His wife’s sister was his\r\nsecond wife, and she bore him a son and daughter, the former called\r\nLang (Tsao-an), the latter Jên. He had also adopted a son from the Yü\r\nfamily named Shao (Kung-li). And he had a younger brother named Ching\r\n(Yu-tʻai).\r\n\r\nAs Sun Chien was leaving on this expedition his brother with all his\r\nsons stood near his steed and dissuaded him, saying, “Tung Cho is the\r\nreal ruler of the State for the Emperor is a weakling. The whole\r\ncountry is in rebellion, every one is scrambling for territory. Our\r\ndistrict is comparatively peaceful and it is wrong to begin a war\r\nmerely for the sake of a little resentment. I pray you, brother, to\r\nthink before you start.”\r\n\r\nChien replied, “Brother, say no more. I desire to make my strength felt\r\neverywhere and shall I not avenge my injuries?”\r\n\r\n“Then father, if you must go, let me accompany you,” said the eldest\r\nson.\r\n\r\nHis request was granted, and father and son embarked to go to ravage\r\nFanchʻêng.\r\n\r\nNow Huang Tsu had placed archers and crossbowmen along the river bank.\r\nWhen the ships approached a flight of arrows met them. Sun ordered his\r\nmen to remain under cover in the ships, which then sailed to and fro\r\ndrawing the fire for three days. Several times a landing was tried, but\r\nshowers of arrows repulsed each attempt. At last the arrows of the\r\ndefenders were all shot away and Sun, who collected them, found he had\r\nmany myriads. Then with a fair wind Sun’s men shot them back at the\r\nenemy. Those on the bank were thrown into great disorder and retired.\r\nThe army then landed and two divisions set out for Huang Tsu’s camp\r\nalong different roads. Between them marched Han Tang and under this\r\ntriple attack Huang Tsu was worsted. He left Fanchʻêng and hastened to\r\nTêngchʻêng.\r\n\r\nLeaving the ships under the command of Huang Kai, Sun led the pursuing\r\nforce. Huang Tsu came out of his city and drew up for battle in the\r\nopen country. When Sun had disposed his army he rode out to the\r\nstandard. His son, clad in armour, placed himself beside his father.\r\n\r\nHuang Tsu rode out with two captains Chang Hu and Chʻên Shêng.\r\nFlourishing his whip, the chief abused his enemy, “You swarm of rebels\r\nfrom Chiangtung, why do you invade the land of a scion of the ruling\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\nChang Hu challenged to combat and Han Tang went out to accept. The two\r\nchampions fought two score bouts and then Chʻên Shêng, seeing his\r\nfellow captain becoming exhausted, rode to his aid. Sun Chien saw him\r\ncoming, laid aside his spear, reached for his bow and shot an arrow\r\nwounding Chʻên Shêng in the face. He fell from his horse. Panic seized\r\nupon Chang at the fall of his comrade and he could no longer defend\r\nhimself. Then Han Tang with a slash of his sword clove his skull in\r\ntwain.\r\n\r\nBoth having fallen, Chʻêng Pʻu galloped up to make prisoner of Huang\r\nTsu, who threw off his helmet, slipped from his steed and mingled for\r\nsafety among his men. Sun Chien led on the attack and drove the enemy\r\nto the Han water, where he ordered Huang Kai to make an immediate\r\nattack on Hanchiang.\r\n\r\nHuang Tsu led his defeated men back and told Liu Piao they were no\r\nmatch for Sun Chien. Kʻuai Liang was called in to advise and he said,\r\n“Our newly defeated men have no heart for fighting now. Therefore we\r\nmust fortify our position, while we seek help from Yüan Shao. Then we\r\ncan extricate ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“A stupid move,” said Tsʻai Mao. “The enemy is at the city gates; shall\r\nwe fold our hands and wait to be slain? Give me men and I will go out\r\nand fight to the finish.”\r\n\r\nSo he was placed in command of a legion and went out to the Hsien hills\r\nwhere he drew up his battle line. Sun Tsʻê led the invaders, now\r\nflushed with success. When Tsʻai approached, Sun Chien looked at him\r\nand said, “He is brother-in-law to Liu Piao; who will capture him?”\r\n\r\nChʻêng Pʻu set his supple spear and rode out. After a few bouts Tsʻai\r\nMao turned and fled. The Suns smote him till corpses filled the\r\ncountry-side and he took refuge in Hsiangyang.\r\n\r\nKʻuai Yen said, “Tsʻai ought to be put to death by military law. This\r\ndefeat was due to his obstinacy.” But Liu Piao was unwilling to punish\r\nthe brother of his newly wedded wife.\r\n\r\nSun Chien surrounded Hsiangyang and assailed the walls daily. One day a\r\nfierce gale sprang up and the pole bearing his standard was broken.\r\n\r\n“Very inauspicious!” said Han Tang. “We ought to go back.”\r\n\r\nHis lord said, “I have won every battle and the city is on the point of\r\nfalling. Shall I return because the wind breaks a flagstaff?”\r\n\r\nHe flouted the advice and attacked the walls still more vigorously.\r\n\r\nWithin the city they had seen an omen. It was told Liu Piao that a\r\ngreat star had fallen into the wild country without the city, and they\r\nhad calculated that it inferred the fall of their enemy. Piao was\r\nadvised to seek help from Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\nSo he wrote. But who would undertake to fight his way through with the\r\nletter? One Lü Kung, a warrior of great strength, offered himself for\r\nthis service. Kʻuai Liang said, “If you undertake this service listen\r\nto my advice. You will have five hundred men; choose good bowmen. Dash\r\nthrough the enemy’s formation and make for Hsien Hill. You will be\r\npursued, but send a hundred men up the hill to prepare large stones and\r\nplace a hundred archers in ambush in the woods. These are not to flee\r\nfrom the pursuers but to beguile them along devious ways round to the\r\nplace where the boulders have been prepared. There stones will be\r\nrolled down and arrows shot. If you succeed, fire off a series of bombs\r\nas a signal and the men in the city will come out to help. If you are\r\nnot pursued get away as fast as possible. To-night will be suitable as\r\nthere is very little moon. Start at dusk.”\r\n\r\nLü Kung, having received these directions, prepared his force to carry\r\nthem out. As soon as day began to close in he went quietly out at the\r\neast gate. Sun Chien was in his tent when he heard shouting and at once\r\nmounted and rode out with thirty men to discover the cause. Lü Kung’s\r\nmen had already hidden themselves in the thick woods. Chien rode ahead\r\nof his escort and soon he found himself alone and close to the enemy.\r\nHe called out to them to halt. Lü at once turned back and came as if to\r\nfight. But they had only exchanged a single pass when he again fled,\r\ntaking the road among the hills. Sun followed but soon lost sight of\r\nhis foe.\r\n\r\nSun turned up the hill. Then the gongs clanged and down the hills fell\r\nshowers of stones, while from among the trees the arrows flew in\r\nclouds. Sun was hit by several arrows and a huge stone crushed in his\r\nhead. Both he and his steed were killed. And so his life ended at the\r\nage of thirty seven.\r\n\r\nHis escort was overpowered and every man of them slain. Then Lü let off\r\na series of bombs, the sign of success, as agreed. At this signal three\r\narmies came out of the city and fell upon the Chiangtung men, throwing\r\nthem into the utmost confusion.\r\n\r\nWhen Huang Kai heard the sound of battle he led up the men from the\r\nships. He met Huang Tsu and took him prisoner after a brief fight.\r\n\r\nChʻêng Pʻu set out to bear the sad news to Sun Tsʻê. While he was\r\nseeking a way out he came across Lü Kung. He at once put his horse at\r\nfull speed and engaged him. After a few bouts Lü went down under a\r\nspear thrust. The battle became general and continued till daylight\r\nbroke, when each drew off his army. Liu Piao withdrew into the city and\r\nwhen Sun Tsʻê returned to the river he heard that his father had\r\nperished in the fight, and his body had been carried within the enemy’s\r\nwalls. He uttered a great cry and the army joined him with wailing and\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n“How can I return home leaving my father’s corpse with them?” cried Sun\r\nTsʻê.\r\n\r\nHuang Kai said, “We have Huang Tsu as our prisoner. Let one enter the\r\ncity and discuss peace, giving up our prisoner for our lord’s body.”\r\n\r\nHe had barely finished speaking when Huang Kʻai offered himself as\r\nmessenger saying he was an old friend of Liu Piao. So he went and peace\r\nwas discussed. Liu Piao told him the body was already laid in a coffin\r\nand ready to be delivered as soon as Huang Tsu returned. “Let us both\r\ncease fighting and never again invade each other’s district,” said he.\r\n\r\nHuan Kʻai thanked him and took his leave. But as he went down the steps\r\nKʻuai Liang suddenly broke in, saying, “No, No! Let me speak and I will\r\nsee to it that not a single breastplate returns. I pray you first put\r\nthis man to death and then employ my means.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pursuing his enemy, Sun Chien dies;\r\n    Even on a peaceful mission Huang Kʻai is threatened.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of the ambassador will be disclosed in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR WANG PREPARES THE “CHAIN” SCHEME:\r\nTUNG CHO’S RAGES AT THE FENGI PAVILION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what Kʻuai Liang said, “Sun Chien is now gone and his sons are\r\nbut youths. Seize this moment of weakness to break into Chiangtung and\r\nit is yours in one beat of the drum. If you return the corpse and make\r\npeace, you give them time to grow powerful and evil will ensue to this\r\ndistrict.”\r\n\r\n“How can I leave Huang Tsu in their hands?” said the Prefect.\r\n\r\n“Why not sacrifice this blundering warrior for a district?”\r\n\r\n“But he is my dear friend and to abandon him is wrong.”\r\n\r\nSo Huan Kʻai was allowed to return to his own side with the\r\nunderstanding that Sun Chien’s dead body should be given in exchange.\r\nSun Tsʻê freed his prisoner, brought away his father’s coffin and the\r\nfighting ceased. Sun Chien was interred in the border of Chüa and when\r\nthe ceremonies were over Sun Tsʻê led his army home again.\r\n\r\nIn his district Sun Tsʻê set himself to the task of ruling well. He\r\ninvited to his side men of wisdom and valour and so bore himself that\r\nall the best and bravest of the country gathered about him.\r\n\r\nBut this part of his story will not be told here. Tung Cho at the\r\ncapital, when he heard of the death of the turbulent prefect, said, “An\r\nevil that pressed hard upon my heart has been removed.” He asked what\r\nsons he had left and when they told him the eldest was but seventeen he\r\ndismissed all anxiety from his thoughts.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward his arrogance and domineering spirit waxed worse\r\nand worse. He styled himself Shang Fu or “Imperial Rector,” a name full\r\nof honour, and in all his behaviour aped imperial state. He created his\r\nyounger brother a marquis and made him Generalissimo of the Left. A\r\nnephew was placed in command of the Palace guards and everyone of his\r\nclan, young or old, was ennobled. At some distance from the capital he\r\nlaid out a city, an exact replica of Chʻangan, with its palaces,\r\ngranaries, treasuries and magazines, and employed a quarter of a\r\nmillion people to build it. Here he accumulated supplies sufficient for\r\ntwenty years. He selected eight hundred of the most beautiful maidens\r\nand sent them to dwell in his new city. The stores of wealth in every\r\nform were incalculable. All his family and retainers found quarters in\r\nthis new city named Meiwu.\r\n\r\nTung Cho visited his city at intervals of a month or so and every visit\r\nwas like an imperial progress, with booths by the roadside to refresh\r\nthe officials and courtiers who attended him to the Hêngmên and saw him\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion he spread a great feast for all those assembled to\r\nwitness his departure and while it was in progress there arrived a\r\nlarge number of malcontents from the north who had voluntarily\r\nsurrendered. The tyrant had them brought before him as he sat at table\r\nand meted out to them wanton cruelties. The hands of this one were\r\nlopped off, the feet of that; one had his eyes gouged out; another lost\r\nhis tongue. Some were boiled to death. Shrieks of agony arose to the\r\nvery heavens and the courtiers were faint with terror, but the author\r\nof the misery ate and drank, chatted and smiled as if nothing was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nAnother day Tung Cho was presiding at a great gathering of officers who\r\nwere seated in two long rows. After the wine had gone up and down\r\nseveral times Lü Pu entered and whispered a few words in his master’s\r\near. Cho smiled and said, “He was always so. Take Chang Wên outside.”\r\nThe others all turned pale. In a little time a serving man brought the\r\nhead of their fellow guest on a red dish and showed it to their host.\r\nThey nearly died with fright.\r\n\r\n“Do not fear,” said Cho smiling. “He was in league with Yüan Shu to\r\nassassinate me. A letter he wrote fell by mistake into the hands of my\r\nson so I have had him put to death. You gentlemen, who have no reason,\r\nneed have no fear.”\r\n\r\nThe officials hastened to disperse. One of them, Governor Wang Yün, who\r\nhad witnessed all this, returned to his palace very pensive and much\r\ndistressed. The same evening, a bright moonlight night, he took his\r\nstaff and went strolling in his private garden. Standing near one of\r\nthe creeper trellises he gazed up at the sky and the tears rolled down\r\nhis cheeks. Suddenly he heard a rustle in the peony pavilion and some\r\none sighing deeply. Stealthily creeping near he saw there one of the\r\nhousehold singing girls named Tiaochʻan or Sable Cicada.\r\n\r\nThis maiden had been brought up in his palace, where she had been\r\ntaught to sing and dance. She was then just bursting into womanhood, a\r\npretty and clever girl whom Wang Yün regarded more as a daughter than a\r\ndependant.\r\n\r\nAfter listening for some time he suddenly called out, “What mischief\r\nare you up to there, you naughty girl?”\r\n\r\nThe maiden dropped on her knees in terror, “Would thy unworthy handmaid\r\ndare to do anything wrong?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Then what are you sighing about out here in the darkness?”\r\n\r\n“May thy handmaid speak from the bottom of her heart?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me the whole truth; do not conceal anything.”\r\n\r\nAnd the girl said, “Thy handmaid has been the recipient of bountiful\r\nkindness. She has been taught to sing and dance and been treated so\r\nkindly that were she torn in pieces for her lord’s sake it would not\r\nrepay a thousandth part. She has noticed lately that her lord’s brows\r\nhave been knit in distress and knows it is on account of the State\r\ntroubles. But she has not dared to ask. This evening he seemed more sad\r\nthan ever and she was miserable on her lord’s account. But she did not\r\nknow she would be seen. Could she be of any use she would not shrink\r\nfrom a myriad deaths.”\r\n\r\nA sudden idea came to Wang and he stuck the ground with his staff. “Who\r\nwould think that the fate of the Hans lay on your palm? Come with me!”\r\n\r\nThe girl followed him into the house. Then he summoned all the waiting\r\nwomen and girls, placed Sable Cicada on a chair and bowed before her.\r\nShe was frightened and threw herself on the ground, asking in terror\r\nwhat it all meant.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “You can sympathise with the people of Han,” and the fount of\r\nhis tears opened afresh.\r\n\r\n“As I said just now, use me in any way; I will never shrink,” said the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nWang Yün knelt saying, “The people are on the brink of destruction, the\r\nprince and his officers are in jeopardy, and you, you are the only\r\nsaviour. That wretch Tung Cho wants to depose the Emperor and not a man\r\namong us can find means to stop him. Now he has a son, a bold warrior\r\nit is true, but both father and son have a weakness for beauty and I am\r\ngoing to use what I may call the “chain” plan. I shall first propose\r\nyou in marriage to Lü Pu and then, after you are betrothed, I shall\r\npresent you to Tung Cho and you will take every opportunity to force\r\nthem asunder and turn away their countenances from each other, cause\r\nthe son to kill his adopted father and so put an end to the great evil.\r\nThus you may restore the altars of the land that it may live again. All\r\nthis lies within your power; will you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Thy handmaid has promised not to recoil from death itself. You may use\r\nmy poor self in any way and I must do my best.”\r\n\r\n“But if this gets abroad then we are all lost!”\r\n\r\n“Fear not,” said she, “if thy handmaid does not show gratitude, may she\r\nperish beneath a myriad swords!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you; thank you!” said Wang Yün.\r\n\r\nThen they took from the family treasury many pearls and bade a cunning\r\njeweler make therewith a fine golden headdress which was sent as a\r\npresent to Lü Pu. He was delighted and came to thank the donor. When he\r\narrived he was met at the gate by the host himself and within found a\r\ntable full of dainties for his delectation. He was conducted into the\r\nprivate apartments and placed in the seat of honour.\r\n\r\nHe said, “I am but a simple officer in the palace of a minister; you\r\nare an exalted officer of State, why am I treated thus?”\r\n\r\n“Because in the whole land there is no warrior your equal. Poor Yün\r\nbows not to an officer’s rank; he bows to his ability.”\r\n\r\nThis gratified Lü Pu mightily and his host continued to praise and\r\nflatter and ply him with wine and to talk of the virtues of the\r\nminister and his henchman.\r\n\r\nLü Pu laughed and drank huge goblets.\r\n\r\nPresently most of the attendants were sent away, only a few kept to\r\npress the guest to drink. When the guest was very mellow Wang Yün\r\nsuddenly said, “Let the child come in!”\r\n\r\nSoon appeared two attendants, dressed in black, leading between them\r\nthe exquisite and fascinating Sable Cicada.\r\n\r\n“Who is this?” said Lü Pu startled into sobriety.\r\n\r\n“This is my little girl, Cicada. You will not be annoyed at my\r\nfamiliarity, will you? But you have been so very friendly, I thought\r\nyou would like to see her.”\r\n\r\nHe bade the girl present a goblet of wine and her eyes met those of the\r\nwarrior.\r\n\r\nThe host feigning intoxication said, “The little one begs you,\r\nCommandant, to take a cup or two. We all depend upon you, all our\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu begged the girl to sit down. She pretended to wish to retire. Her\r\nmaster pressed her to remain, saying that she might do so since the\r\nguest was a dear friend. So she took a seat modestly near her master.\r\n\r\nLü Pu kept his gaze fixed upon the maid while he swallowed cup after\r\ncup of wine.\r\n\r\n“I should like to present her to you as a handmaid; would you accept?”\r\n\r\nThe guest started up. “If that is so you may rely upon my abject\r\ngratitude,” said he.\r\n\r\n“We will choose a propitious day ere long and send her to the palace.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu was over-joyed. He could not keep his eyes off the girl and\r\nloving glances flashed from her liquid orbs.\r\n\r\nHowever the time came for the guest to leave and Wang said, “I would\r\nask you to remain the night but the Minister might suspect something.”\r\n\r\nThe guest thanked him again and again and departed. Some few days later\r\nwhen Wang Yün was at court and Lü Pu was absent he bowed low before\r\nTung Cho and said, “I would that you would deign to come to dine at my\r\nlowly cottage, could your noble thought bend that way!”\r\n\r\n“Should you invite me I would certainly hasten,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nWang Yün thanked him. He went home and prepared in the reception hall a\r\nfeast in which figured every delicacy from land and sea. Beautiful\r\nembroideries surrounded the chief seat in the centre and elegant\r\ncurtains were hung within and without. At noon next day, when the\r\nMinister arrived, his host met him at the gate in full court costume.\r\nHe stood by while Tung Cho stepped out of his chariot and he and a host\r\nof armed guards crowded into the hall. Tung Cho took his seat at the\r\ntop, his suite fell into two lines right and left, while the host stood\r\nhumbly at the lower end. Tung Cho bade his people conduct Wang to a\r\nplace beside himself.\r\n\r\nSaid Wang, “The great minister’s abundant virtue is as the high\r\nmountains; neither I Yin nor Duke Chou could attain thereto.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho smiled. They bore in the dishes and the wine and the music\r\nbegan. Wang Yün plied his guest with assiduous flattery and studied\r\ndeference. When it grew late and the wine had done its work the guest\r\nwas invited to the inner chamber. So he sent away his guards and went.\r\nHere the host raised a goblet and drank to his guest saying, “From my\r\nyouth up I have understood something of astrology and have been\r\nstudying the aspect of the heavens. I read that the days of Han are\r\nnumbered and that the great Minister’s merits command the regard of all\r\nthe world as when Shun succeeded Yao and Yü continued the work of Shun,\r\nconforming to the mind of heaven and the desire of man.”\r\n\r\n“How dare I expect this?” said Cho.\r\n\r\n“From the days of old those who walk in the way have replaced those who\r\ndeviate therefrom; those who lack virtue have fallen before those who\r\npossess it. Can one escape fate?”\r\n\r\n“If indeed the decree of heaven devolve on me; you shall be held the\r\nfirst in merit,” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\nWang Yün bowed. Then lights were brought in and all the attendants were\r\ndismissed save the serving maids to hand the wine. So the evening went\r\non.\r\n\r\nPresently the host said, “The music of these everyday musicians is too\r\ncommonplace for your ear, but there happens to be in the house a little\r\nmaid that might please you.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said the guest.\r\n\r\nThen a curtain was lowered. The shrill tones of reed instruments rang\r\nthrough the room and presently some attendants led forward Cicada, who\r\nthen danced on the outside of the curtain.\r\n\r\nA poem says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        For a palace this maiden was born,\r\n          So timid, so graceful, so slender,\r\n        Like a tiny bird flitting at morn\r\n          O’er the dew-laden lily-buds tender.\r\n        Were this exquisite maid only mine,\r\n        For never a mansion I’d pine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother poem runs thus:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The music calls; the dancer comes, a swallow gliding in,\r\n      A dainty little damsel, light as air;\r\n    Her beauty captivates the guest yet saddens him within,\r\n      For he must soon depart and leave her there.\r\n    She smiles; no gold could buy that smile, no other smileth so,\r\n      No need to deck her form with jewels rare,\r\n    But when the dance is over and coy glances come and go,\r\n      Then who shall be the chosen of the fair?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dance ended, Tung Cho bade them lead the maiden in, and she came,\r\nbowing low as she approached him. He was much taken with her beauty and\r\nmodest grace.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” said he.\r\n\r\n“A singing girl; we call her Sable Cicada.”\r\n\r\n“Then can she sing?”\r\n\r\nThe master bade her sing and she did so to the accompaniment of\r\ncastanets. There is a measure describing her youthful beauty:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        You stand, a dainty maiden,\r\n            Your cherry lips so bright,\r\n            Your teeth so pearly white,\r\n        Your fragrant breath love-laden;\r\n            Yet is your tongue a sword;\r\n            Cold death is the reward\r\n        Of loving thee, O maiden.\r\n\r\n\r\nTung Cho was delighted and praised her warmly. She was told to present\r\na goblet of wine to the guest which he took from her hands and then\r\nasked her age.\r\n\r\nShe replied, “Thy unworthy handmaid is just sixteen.”\r\n\r\n“A perfect little fairy!” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\nThen Wang Yün rose and said, “If the Minister would not mind I should\r\nlike to offer him this little maid.”\r\n\r\n“How could I be grateful enough for such a kindness?”\r\n\r\n“She would be most fortunate if she could be your servant,” said Wang.\r\n\r\nCho thanked his host warmly.\r\n\r\nThen the orders were given to prepare a closed carriage and convey\r\nSable Cicada to the palace.\r\n\r\nSoon after Tung Cho took his leave and Wang Yün accompanied him the\r\nwhole way.\r\n\r\nAfter he had taken leave he mounted to ride homeward. Half way he met\r\ntwo lines of men with red lamps who were escorting Lü Pu on horseback\r\nand armed with his halberd. Seeing Wang Yün he at once reined in,\r\nstopped, seized him by the sleeve and said angrily, “You promised\r\nCicada to me and now you have given her to the Minister: what foolery\r\nis this?”\r\n\r\nWang Yün checked him. “This is no place to talk; I pray you come to my\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nSo they went together and he led Lü Pu into a private room. After the\r\nusual exchange of polite greetings Wang said, “Why do you find fault\r\nwith me, Commander?”\r\n\r\n“Somebody told me that you had sent Cicada to the Minister’s palace in\r\na covered carriage: what does it mean?”\r\n\r\n“Of course you do not understand. Yesterday when I was at court the\r\nMinister told me he had something to talk to me about in my own house.\r\nSo naturally I prepared for his coming and while we were at dinner he\r\nsaid, “I have heard something of a girl named Sable Cicada whom you\r\nhave promised to my son Fêng-hsien. I thought it was mere rumour so I\r\nwanted to ask if it was true. Beside I should like to see her.” I could\r\nnot say no, so she came in and made her bow to the lord of lords. Then\r\nhe said that it was a lucky day and he would take her away with him and\r\nbetroth her to you. Just think, Sir; when the Minister had come\r\nhimself, could I stop him?”\r\n\r\n“You were not so very wrong,” said Pu, “but for a time I had\r\nmisunderstood you. I owe you an apology.”\r\n\r\n“The girl has a small trousseau, which I will send as soon as she has\r\ngone over to your dwelling.”\r\n\r\nPu thanked him and went away. Next day he went into the palace to find\r\nout the truth, but could hear nothing. Then he made his way into the\r\nprivate quarters and questioned the maids. Presently one told him that\r\nthe Minister had brought home a new bedfellow the night before and was\r\nnot up yet. Pu was very angry. Next he crept round behind his master’s\r\nsleeping apartment.\r\n\r\nBy this time Cicada had risen and was dressing her hair at the window.\r\nLooking out she saw a long shadow fall across the little lake. She\r\nrecognised the headdress and peeping around she saw it was indeed no\r\nother than Lü Pu. Thereupon she contracted her eyebrows, simulating the\r\ndeepest grief, and with her dainty handkerchief she wiped her eyes\r\nagain and again. Lü Pu stood watching her a long time.\r\n\r\nSoon after he went in to give morning greeting. His master was sitting\r\nin the reception room. Seeing his henchman he asked if there was\r\nanything new.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” was the reply and he waited while Tung Cho took his morning\r\nmeal. As he stood beside his master he glanced over at the curtain and\r\nsaw a woman there behind the screen showing a half face from time to\r\ntime and throwing amorous glances at him. He felt it was his beloved\r\nand his thoughts flew to her. Presently Cho noticed his expression and\r\nbegan to feel suspicious.\r\n\r\n“If there is nothing you may go,” said he.\r\n\r\nLü Pu sulkily withdrew.\r\n\r\nTung Cho now thought of nothing but his new mistress and for more than\r\na month neglected all affairs, devoting himself entirely to pleasure.\r\nHe was a little indisposed and Cicada was constantly at his side, never\r\neven undressing to show her solicitude. She gratified his every whim.\r\nCho grew more and more fond of her.\r\n\r\nOne day Lü Pu went to enquire after his father’s health. Tung Cho was\r\nasleep and Cicada was sitting at the head of his couch. Leaning forward\r\nshe gazed at the visitor, with one hand pointed to her heart, the other\r\nat Tung Cho asleep, and her tears fell. Lü Pu felt heartbroken. Cho\r\ndrowsily opened his eyes, and seeing his son’s gaze fixed on something\r\nbehind him, turned over and saw who it was. He angrily rebuked Pu\r\nsaying, “Dare you make love to my beauty?” He told the servants to turn\r\nhim out and not allow him to come in again.\r\n\r\nLü Pu went off home very wrath. Meeting Li Ju he told him the cause of\r\nhis anger. The adviser hastened to see his master and said, “Sir, you\r\naspire to be ruler of the State, why then for a small fault do you\r\nblame the Marquis? If he turn against you, it is all over.”\r\n\r\n“Then what can I do?” said Cho.\r\n\r\n“Recall him to-morrow; treat him well; overwhelm him with gifts and\r\nfair words and all will be well.”\r\n\r\nSo Tung Cho did so. He sent for Lü Pu and was very gracious and said,\r\n“I was irritable and hasty yesterday owing to my illness and I wronged\r\nyou, I know. Forget it.”\r\n\r\nHe gave him ten catties of gold and twenty rolls of brocade. And so the\r\nquarrel was made up. But though Lü’s body was with Tung his heart was\r\nwith his promised bride.\r\n\r\nTung Cho having quite recovered went to court again and Lü Pu followed\r\nhim as usual. Seeing Tung Cho deep in conversation with the Emperor, Lü\r\nPu, armed as he was, went out of the palace and rode off to his chief’s\r\nresidence. He tied up his steed at the entrance and, halberd in hand,\r\nwent to the private apartments to seek his love. He found her and she\r\ntold him to go out into the garden where she would join him soon. He\r\nwent, taking his halberd with him, and he leaned against the rail of\r\nthe Phoenix Pavilion to wait for Cicada.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time she appeared, swaying gracefully as she made her way\r\nunder the drooping willows and parting the flowers as she passed. She\r\nwas exquisite, a perfect little fairy from the Palace of the Moon.\r\nTears were in her eyes as she came up and said, “Though I am not the\r\nGovernor’s real daughter yet he treated me as his own child. The desire\r\nof my life was fulfilled when he plighted me to you. But Oh! to think\r\nof the wickedness of the Minister, stealing my poor self as he did. I\r\nsuffered so much. I longed to die, only that I had not told you the\r\nreal truth. So I lived on, bearing my shame as best as I could but\r\nfeeling it mean still to live. Now that I have seen you I can end it\r\nall. My poor sullied body is no longer fit to serve a hero. I can die\r\nbefore your eyes and so prove how true I am!”\r\n\r\nThus speaking she seized the curving rail as if to jump into the lily\r\npond. Lü Pu caught her in his strong arms and wept as he held her\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n“I knew it; I always knew your heart,” he sobbed. “Only we never had a\r\nchance to speak.”\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms about Lü Pu. “If I cannot be your wife in this life\r\nI will in the ages to come,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“If I do not marry you in this life, I am no hero,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Every day is a year long. O pity me! Rescue me!”\r\n\r\n“I have only stolen away for a brief moment and I am afraid that old\r\nrebel will suspect something, so I must not stay too long,” said Pu.\r\n\r\nThe girl clung to his robe.\r\n\r\n“If you fear the old thief so much I shall never see another sunrise.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu stopped. “Give me a little time to think,” said he. And he picked\r\nup his halberd to go.\r\n\r\n“In the deep seclusion of the harem, I heard the stories of your\r\nprowess; you were the one man who excelled all others. Little did I\r\nthink that you of all men would rest content under the dominion of\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nAnd tears rained again!\r\n\r\nA wave of shame flooded his face. Leaning his halberd against the\r\nrailing he turned and clasped the girl to his breast, soothing her with\r\nfond words. The lovers held each other close swaying to and fro with\r\nemotion. How could they bring themselves to say farewell?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Tung Cho missed his henchman and doubt filled his\r\nheart. Hastily taking leave of the Emperor, he mounted his chariot and\r\nreturned to his palace. There at the gate stood Lü Pu’s well known\r\nsteed, riderless. He questioned the doorkeepers and they told him the\r\nMarquis was within. He sent away his attendants and went alone to the\r\nprivate apartments. Lü Pu was not there. He called Cicada, but she did\r\nnot reply. He asked where she was and the waiting maids told him she\r\nwas in the garden among the flowers.\r\n\r\nSo he went into the garden and there he saw the lovers in the pavilion\r\nin most tender talk. Lü Pu’s halberd was leaning on the railing beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA howl of rage escaped Tung Cho and startled the lovers. Lü Pu turned,\r\nsaw who it was and ran away. Cho caught up the halberd and ran in\r\npursuit. But Lü Pu was fleet of foot while his master was very stout.\r\nSeeing no hope of catching the runaway Cho hurled the halberd. Lü Pu\r\nfended it off and it fell to the ground. Cho picked it up and ran on.\r\nBut by this time Lü Pu was far ahead. Just as Cho was running out at\r\nthe garden gate he dashed full tilt against another man running in, and\r\ndown he went.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Surged up his wrath within him as the billows heavenward leap,\r\n    Crashed his unwieldy body to earth in a shapeless heap.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall presently see who the other runner was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLÜ PU HELPS TO SUPPRESS DISORDER:\r\nCHIA HSÜ COUNSELS AN ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person who collided with the irate Tung Cho was his most trusty\r\nadviser Li Ju. Li had not fallen in spite of the shock and at once\r\nhelped his master to regain his feet and led him inside to the library,\r\nwhere they sat down.\r\n\r\n“What were you coming about?”\r\n\r\n“Happening to be passing your gates I heard that you had gone into your\r\nprivate garden to look for your adopted son. Then came Lü Pu running\r\nand crying out that you wanted to kill him, and I was coming in as fast\r\nas I could to intercede for him when I accidentally collided with you.\r\nI am very sorry. I deserve death.”\r\n\r\n“The wretch! How could I bear to see him toying with my fair one? I\r\nwill be the death of him yet.”\r\n\r\n“Your Graciousness is making a mistake. It is the ‘plucked tassel’\r\nstory over again. But if you remember Prince Chuang of Chʻu made no\r\nfuss about the liberties taken with his lady love, although the\r\nhat-tassel in her hand betrayed the culprit. His restraint stood him in\r\ngood stead, for the same man saved his life when he was hemmed in by\r\nthe hosts of Tsʻin. After all Cicada is only a woman, but Lü Pu is your\r\ntrustiest friend and most dreaded commander. If you took this chance of\r\nmaking the girl over to him, your kindness would win his undying\r\ngratitude. I beg you, Sir, to think over it well.”\r\n\r\nTung Cho hesitated a long time; he sat murmuring to himself. Presently\r\nhe said, “What you say is right. I must think over it.”\r\n\r\nLi Ju felt satisfied. He took leave of his master and went away. Cho\r\nwent to his private rooms and called Cicada.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing there with Lü Pu?” said he.\r\n\r\nShe began to weep. “Thy handmaid was in the garden among the flowers,\r\nwhen he rushed in on me. I was frightened and ran away. He asked why I\r\nran away from a son of the family and pursued me right to the pavilion,\r\nwhere you saw us. He had that halberd in his hand all the time. I felt\r\nhe was a vicious man and would force me to his will so I tried to throw\r\nmyself into the lily pond, but he caught me in his arms and held me so\r\nthat I was helpless. Luckily just at that moment you came and saved my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I send you to him.”\r\n\r\nShe shrieked with terror.\r\n\r\n“After having been yours to be given to a mere slave! Never! I would\r\nrather die.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this she snatched down a dagger hanging on the wall to kill\r\nherself. Tung Cho plucked it from her hand and, throwing his arms about\r\nher, cried, “I was only joking.”\r\n\r\nShe lay back on his breast hiding her face and sobbing bitterly. “This\r\nis the doing of that Li Ju,” said she. “He is much too thick with Lü\r\nPu. He suggested that, I know. Little he cares for your reputation or\r\nmy life. Oh! I would like to eat him alive.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could bear to lose you?”\r\n\r\n“Though you love me yet I must not stay here. That Lü Pu will do me\r\nsome harm if I do. I fear him.”\r\n\r\n“We will go to Meiwu to-morrow, you and I, and we will be happy\r\ntogether and have no cares.”\r\n\r\nShe dried her tears and thanked him. Next day Li Ju came again to\r\npersuade Tung Cho to send the damsel to Lü Pu. “This is a propitious\r\nday,” said he.\r\n\r\n“He and I standing in the relation of father and son I cannot very well\r\ndo that,” said Tung Cho. “But I will say no more about his fault. You\r\nmay tell him so and soothe him as well as you can.”\r\n\r\n“You are not being beguiled by the woman, are you?” said Li.\r\n\r\nTung Cho coloured. “Would you like to give your wife to some body else?\r\nDo not talk about this any further. It would be better not to.”\r\n\r\nLi left the chamber. When he got outside he cast his eyes up to heaven,\r\nsaying, “We are dead men, slain by the hand of this girl.”\r\n\r\nWhen a certain student of history reached this episode he wrote a verse\r\nor two:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Just introduce a woman,\r\n            Conspiracies succeed;\r\n        Of soldiers, or their weapons,\r\n            There really is no need.\r\n        They fought their bloody battles,\r\n            And doughty deeds were done;\r\n        But in a garden summer house\r\n            The victory was won.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe order was given to journey to Meiwu and the whole body of officers\r\nassembled to add lustre to the start. Cicada, from her carriage, saw Lü\r\nPu among the crowd. She at once dropped her eyes and assumed an\r\nappearance of deepest melancholy. After the cavalcade started and when\r\nher carriage had almost disappeared in the distance, the disappointed\r\nlover reined in his steed on a mount whence he could watch the dust\r\nthat rose around it. Unutterable sadness filled his heart.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice said, “Why do you not accompany the Minister, Marquis,\r\ninstead of standing here and sighing?”\r\n\r\nIt was Wan Yün. “I have been confined to the house by illness these few\r\ndays,” continued he, “so I have not seen you. But I had to struggle out\r\nto-day to see the Minister set off. This meeting is most fortunate. But\r\nwhy were you sighing?”\r\n\r\n“Just on account of that damsel of yours,” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nFeigning great astonishment he said, “So long a time and yet not given\r\nto you!”\r\n\r\n“The old ruffian has fallen in love with her himself.”\r\n\r\n“Surely this cannot be true.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu related the whole story while Wang Yün listened, silent, but\r\nstamping on the ground as with irritation and perplexity. After a long\r\ntime he said, “I did not think he was such a beast.”\r\n\r\nTaking Lü Pu by the hand he said, “Come to my house and we will talk it\r\nover.”\r\n\r\nSo they went away together to the house and retired to a secret room.\r\nAfter some refreshments, Lü Pu told the whole story of the episode in\r\nthe garden just as it happened.\r\n\r\n“He seems to have corrupted my little girl and has stolen your wife. He\r\nwill be an object of shame and ridicule to the whole world. And those\r\nwho do not laugh at him will laugh at you and me. Alas! I am old and\r\npowerless and can do nothing. More’s the pity! But you, Commander, you\r\nare a warrior, the greatest hero in the world. Yet you have been put to\r\nthis shame and exposed to this contempt.”\r\n\r\nA wave of fierce wrath rolled up in Lü Pu. Banging the table he shouted\r\nand roared. His host ostentatiously tried to calm him saying, “I forgot\r\nmyself. I should not have spoken like that. Do not be so angry, I\r\npray.”\r\n\r\n“I will kill the wretch, I swear it. In no other way can I wash away my\r\nshame.”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Do not say such a thing,” said Wang, putting his hand over the\r\nother’s mouth. “You will bring trouble on poor me.”\r\n\r\n“When a man is born great he cannot be patient for long under another\r\nman’s domination,” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“It needs some one greater than the Minister to limit the scope of such\r\ntalents as yours.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu said, “I would not mind killing the old wretch were it not for\r\nthe relation in which we stand. I fear to provoke the hostile criticism\r\nof posterity.”\r\n\r\nHis host smiled. “Your name is Lü; his is Tung. Where was the paternal\r\nfeeling when he threw the halberd at you?”\r\n\r\n“I had been misled if you had not said that,” said Lü hotly.\r\n\r\nWang Yün saw the effect of his words and continued, “It would be a\r\nloyal deed to restore the House of Han, and history would hand down\r\nyour name to posterity perpetually fragrant. If you lend your aid to\r\nTung Cho you will be a traitor and your name will stink through all the\r\nages.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu rose from his place and bowed to Wang Yün. “I have decided,” said\r\nhe. “You need not fear, Sir.”\r\n\r\n“But yet you may fail and bring upon yourself misfortune,” said Wang.\r\n\r\nLü Pu drew his dagger and pricking his arm swore by the blood that\r\nflowed.\r\n\r\nWang fell on his knees and thanked him. “Then the Han sacrifices will\r\nnot be cut off and you will be their saviour. But this must remain a\r\nsecret and I will tell you how the plot shall be worked out.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu took leave with great emotion.\r\n\r\nWang Yün took into his confidence two colleagues, Sun Jui and Huang\r\nYüan. The former said, “The moment is favourable. The Emperor has just\r\nrecovered from his illness and we can despatch an able talker to Meiwu\r\nto persuade Tung Cho to come here to discuss affairs. Meanwhile we will\r\nobtain a secret decree as authority for Lü Pu. Lay an ambush just\r\ninside the palace gates to kill Cho as he enters. This is the best plan\r\nto adopt.”\r\n\r\n“But who would dare to go?”\r\n\r\n“Li Su would go. He belongs to the same district as Lü Pu and is very\r\nangry with the Minister for not advancing him. His going would excite\r\nno suspicions.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Wang Yün. “Let us see what Lü Pu thinks of it.”\r\n\r\nWhen Pu was consulted he told them that this man’s persuasion had led\r\nhim to kill Ting, his former benefactor. “If he refuse this mission I\r\nwill kill him,” said he.\r\n\r\nSo they sent for Li Su. When he arrived Lü Pu said, “Formerly you\r\ntalked me into killing Ting and going over to Tung Cho. Now we find\r\nTung Cho means evil for the Emperor and is an oppressor of the people.\r\nHis iniquities are many and he is hated of gods and men. You go to\r\nMeiwu, say you have a command from the Emperor to summon Tung Cho to\r\nthe palace. He will come and he will be put to death. You will have the\r\ncredit of being loyal and restoring the Hans. Will you undertake this?”\r\n\r\n“I also wish to slay him,” was the reply. “But I could not find any to\r\nassist me. How can I hesitate? Your intervention is directly from\r\nheaven.”\r\n\r\nAnd he snapped an arrow in twain as register of his oath.\r\n\r\n“If this succeed, what glorious rank will be yours!” said Wang Yün.\r\n\r\nNext day Li Su, with a small escort, set out for Meiwu and announced\r\nhimself as bearer of a decree. He was conducted into Tung Cho’s\r\npresence. After he had made his obeisance Tung asked what the decree\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“His Majesty has recovered and wishes his ministers to meet him in the\r\npalace to consider the question of his abdication in your favour. That\r\nis what this summons means.”\r\n\r\n“What does Wang Yün think of the scheme?”\r\n\r\n“Wang Yün has already begun the construction of the Terrace of\r\nAbdication and only awaits my lord’s arrival.”\r\n\r\n“Last night I dreamed a dragon coiled round my body,” said Tung Cho\r\ngreatly pleased, “and now I get this happy tidings! I must not neglect\r\nthe opportunity.”\r\n\r\nSo he gave instructions for the safekeeping of his city and announced\r\nhis intention of starting on the morrow.\r\n\r\n“When I am Emperor you shall be my Precursor,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Your minister thanks you,” said Li.\r\n\r\nCho went to bid farewell to his aged mother. “Whither are you going, my\r\nson?”\r\n\r\n“I go to receive the abdication of Han; and soon you will be Empress\r\nDowager.”\r\n\r\n“I have been feeling nervous and creepy these few days. It is a bad\r\nsign.”\r\n\r\n“Any one about to become the mother of the State must have\r\npremonitions,” said her son.\r\n\r\nHe left her with these words. Just before starting he said to Cicada,\r\n“When I am Emperor, you shall be Kuei-fei, the first of my ladies.” She\r\nbowed low thanking him, but she knew and inwardly rejoiced.\r\n\r\nHe went out and mounted his carriage, and began his journey to the\r\nCapital with an imposing escort. Less than half way the wheel of his\r\ncarriage broke. He left it and mounted a horse. Soon after the horse\r\nsnorted and neighed, threw up his head and snapped the reins.\r\n\r\nTung Cho turned to Li Su and asked what these things portended.\r\n\r\n“It means that you are going to receive the abdication of the Hans,\r\nwhich is to renew all things, to mount the jewelled chariot and sit in\r\nthe golden saddle.”\r\n\r\nAnd Cho believed him. During the second day’s journey a violent gale\r\nsprang up and the sky became covered with a thick mist. The wily Li Su\r\nhad an interpretation for this also. “You are ascending to the place of\r\nthe dragon; there must be bright light and lurid vapour to dignify your\r\nmajestic approach.”\r\n\r\nCho had no more doubts. He presently arrived and found many officials\r\nwaiting without the city gate to receive him, all but Li Ju who was ill\r\nand unable to leave his chamber. He entered and proceeded to his own\r\npalace, where Lü Pu came to congratulate him.\r\n\r\n“When I sit on the throne, you shall command the whole armies of the\r\nEmpire, horse and foot,” said he.\r\n\r\nThat night Cho slept in a tent in the midst of his escort. In the\r\nsuburbs that evening some children at play were singing a little ditty\r\nand the words drifted in on the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The grass in the meadow looks fresh now and green,\r\n    Yet wait but ten days, not a blade will be seen.” [3]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song sounded ominous but Li Su was again prepared with a happy\r\ninterpretation. “It only means that the Lius are about to disappear and\r\nthe Tungs to be exalted.”\r\n\r\nNext morning at the first streak of dawn Tung Cho prepared for his\r\nappearance at court. On the way he saw a Taoist, dressed in a black\r\nrobe and wearing a white turban, who carried in his hand a tall staff\r\nwith a long strip of white cloth attached. At each end of the cloth was\r\ndrawn a mouth.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this?” said Tung Cho.\r\n\r\n“He is a madman,” said Li Su, and he told the guards to drive the\r\nfellow away.\r\n\r\nTung Cho went in and found all the officials in court dress lining the\r\nroad. Li Su walked beside his carriage, a sword in his hand. When he\r\nreached the side room on the north he found soldiers drawn up outside\r\nand only the pushers of the palace carriage, a score or so, were\r\nallowed to proceed further. When he arrived near the Reception Hall he\r\nsaw that Wang Yün and all the other officials standing at the door were\r\narmed.\r\n\r\n“Why are they all armed?” said he to Li Su. Li Su was silent. The\r\npushers urged the carriage forward swiftly to the entrance.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Wang Yün shouted, “The rebel is here! where are the\r\nexecutioners?”\r\n\r\nAt this call sprang from both sides men armed with halberds and spears\r\nwho attacked Tung Cho. He had not put on the breastplate he usually\r\nwore and a spear pierced his breast. He sank down in the carriage\r\ncalling loudly for his son, “Where is Fêng-hsien?”\r\n\r\n“Here, and with a decree to deal with a rebel,” said Lü Pu savagely, as\r\nhe appeared in front of his “father.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he thrust his halberd through his victim’s throat. Then Li Su\r\nhacked off the head and held it up. Lü Pu, his left hand holding his\r\nhalberd, thrust his right hand into his bosom whence he drew the\r\ndecree, crying, “The decree was to slay the rebel Tung Cho; no other.”\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly shouted, “Live for ever! O Emperor.”\r\n\r\nA sympathetic poet has written a few lines in pity:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Await the time, O noble, and be king,\r\n        Or failing, reap the solace riches bring;\r\n        Heaven n’er is partial, but severely just,\r\n        Meiwu stood strong yet now it lies in dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lust of blood awakened, Lü Pu urged the slaughter of Li Ju, who had\r\nbeen the confidant of the murdered Minister and Li Su volunteered to go\r\nin search of him. But just then a shouting was heard at the gates and\r\nit was told them that a household slave had brought their intended\r\nvictim in bonds. Wang Yün ordered his immediate execution in the market\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nTung Cho’s head was exposed in a crowded thoroughfare. He was very fat\r\nand the guards made torches by sticking splints into the body. The\r\npassers-by pelted the poor head and spurned the body with their feet.\r\n\r\nA large force under Lü Pu was sent to destroy Meiwu. His first captive\r\nwas Cicada. Then they slew every member of the Tung family, sparing\r\nnone, not even his aged mother. Some of his particular adherents, with\r\nthe “Flying Bear” force, fled to Chingchou. In Meiwu were hidden many\r\nyoung ladies of good family. These were set free. The spoil was\r\nenormous; stores of wealth in all its forms had been collected there.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to report success Wang Yün rewarded and feasted the\r\nsoldiers. Banquets were held in the halls to which all the officials\r\nwere invited. They drank and congratulated each other. While the\r\nfeasting was in progress it was announced that some one had come and\r\nwas wailing over the corpse exposed in the market place.\r\n\r\n“Tung Cho has been put to death,” said Wang Yün, angrily. “Every body\r\nis glad to be rid of him and yet one is found to lament over him. Who\r\nis this?”\r\n\r\nSo he gave orders to arrest the mourner and bring him in. Soon he was\r\nbrought in and when they saw him all were startled. For he was no other\r\nthan Tsʻai Yung the Shih-chung.\r\n\r\nWang Yün spoke to him angrily, “Tung Cho has been put to death as a\r\nrebel and all the land rejoices. You, a Han Minister, instead of\r\nrejoicing, weep for him. Why?”\r\n\r\nYung confessed his fault. “I am without talent, yet know I what is\r\nright. Am I the man to turn my back on my country and toward Tung Cho?\r\nYet once I experienced his kindness and I could not help mourning for\r\nhim. I know my fault is grave but I pray you to regard the reasons. If\r\nyou will leave my head and only cut off my feet, you may use me to\r\ncontinue the History of Han, whereby I may have the good fortune to be\r\nallowed to expiate my fault.”\r\n\r\nAll were sorry for him, for he was a man of great talents and they\r\nbegged that he might be spared. The Preceptor Ma secretly interceded\r\nfor him, pointing out that he was famous as a scholar, that he could\r\nwrite glorious history, and that it was inadvisable to put to death a\r\nman renowned for rectitude. But in vain. The Great Councillor was now\r\nstrong and obdurate.\r\n\r\n“Ssŭ-ma Chʻien was spared and employed on the annals, with the result\r\nthat many slanderous stories have been handed down to us. This is a\r\ntrying period of great perplexity and we dare not let a specious fellow\r\nlike this wield his pencil in criticism of those about the court of a\r\nyouthful prince and abuse us as he will.”\r\n\r\nRemonstrance and appeal being vain Ma retired. But he said to his\r\ncolleagues, “Is Wang Yün then careless of the future? Worthy men are\r\nthe mainstay of the State: laws are the canons of action. To destroy\r\nthe mainstay and nullify the laws is to hasten destruction.”\r\n\r\nAs was just said Wang Yün was obdurate. The man whose offence was an\r\nexpression of gratitude was thrown into prison and there strangled. The\r\npeople of that day wept for him, for they refused to see any offence in\r\nwhat he had done and death was a harsh punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tung, the harsh dictator,\r\n            Tyrannised the State,\r\n        Fell and his sole mourner\r\n            Shared his direful fate.\r\n        Chuko in seclusion\r\n            Was content to dream.\r\n        Felt his worth and never\r\n            Helped a traitor’s scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose of his adherents whom Tung Cho had left to guard his city fled\r\nwhen their master was slain and went into Shênsi. Thence they sent in a\r\nmemorial entreating amnesty. But Wang Yün would not hear of it. Four of\r\nthem were the chief instruments of Cho’s aggressions. Now though a\r\ngeneral amnesty were proclaimed these men should be excluded from its\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe messenger returned and told the four there was no hope of pardon\r\nand they could only flee.\r\n\r\nAdviser Chia Hsü said, “If we throw away our arms and flee singly then\r\nwe shall fall easy victims to any village beadle who may seize us.\r\nRather let us cajole the Shênsi people to throw in their lot with us\r\nand make a sudden onslaught on the capital and so avenge our master. If\r\nwe succeed, we control the court and the country. It will be time\r\nenough to run away if we fail.”\r\n\r\nThe plan was adopted and they spread abroad the story that Wang Yün\r\nintended to harry the district. Having thus thrown the people into a\r\nstate of terror they went a step farther and said, “There is no\r\nadvantage in dying for nothing. Revolt and join us.” So they cajoled\r\nthe people into joining them and gathered a host equal to ten legions.\r\nThis horde was divided into four parts and they all set out to raid the\r\ncapital. On the way they fell in with a son-in-law of their late chief,\r\nwith a number of soldiers. He had set out to avenge his father-in-law\r\nand he became the van-leader of the horde.\r\n\r\nAs they advanced the news came to Wang Yün and he consulted Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“They are a lot of rats,” said he. “Never mind how many there are of\r\nthem. Be not in the least anxious.”\r\n\r\nSo Lü Pu and Li Su went to oppose them. The latter was in advance and\r\nmet Niu Fu. They fought; Niu Fu was outmatched and retired. But\r\nunexpectedly Niu Fu returned in a night attack, found Li Su quite\r\nunprepared and drove his force some thirty li, slaying many.\r\n\r\nLi went to tell his chief who raged at him saying, “You have sullied my\r\nreputation as a warrior and destroyed my prestige.”\r\n\r\nAnd he put Li Su to death, exposing his head at the camp gate.\r\n\r\nNext day Lü Pu advanced his own force and engaged Niu Fu. Could the\r\nresult be the least dubious? Niu Fu was driven off. That night he\r\ncalled in his friend Hu Chʻih-êrh to advise him.\r\n\r\n“Lü Pu is too doughty a fighter for us to hope to overcome him. Our\r\ncase is hopeless. Our best course is to desert these four men, secrete\r\nour valuables and leave the army with just a few of our followers.”\r\n\r\nThe plan of Niu Fu was adopted and the two traitors that very night\r\npacked up and made their way out of camp. They were only half a dozen.\r\nThey came to a river and, while crossing, Hu Chʻih-êrh, tempted by the\r\nlust of wealth, slew his companion. Then he went to offer the head to\r\nLü Pu. Lü Pu enquired into the matter and when a follower told him the\r\ntruth, he put the double traitor to death.\r\n\r\nThen he advanced against the rebels and fell in with Li Tsʻui’s force.\r\nWithout giving them time to form in battle array, he attacked. Horses\r\ncurvetting and spears set, the men dashed in irresistibly and Li Tsʻui,\r\nmaking no stand, fell back a long way. He took up a position under a\r\nhill and thence sent to call his fellows to council.\r\n\r\nLi Tsʻui said, “Lü Pu though brave in battle is no strategist and so\r\nnot really formidable. I will lead my men to hold the mouth of the\r\ngorge and every day I will incite him to attack and, when he comes\r\ntoward me, Commander Kuo can smite his rear, after the manner of Pʻêng\r\nYüeh when he fought against Chʻu. While thus I am alternating attack\r\nand retreat you other two will march off in different directions toward\r\nChʻangan. Such an attack at two points must end in his defeat.”\r\n\r\nThey set themselves to carry out this scheme. As soon as Lü Pu reached\r\nthe hills a force came out to attack him. Pu made an angry dash toward\r\nthe enemy, who retired up the hill, whence they shot arrows and hurled\r\nstones like rain. Lü Pu’s men halted. At this moment the report came\r\nthat the rear was being attacked and there appeared Kuo Ssŭ. At once Lü\r\nPu wheeled toward the new enemy, but immediately the rolling drums gave\r\nthe signal to retire and Lü Pu could not come to blows with them. As he\r\ncalled in his men the gongs clanged on the other side and his former\r\nopponent came as if to smite him. But before he could join battle his\r\nrear was again threatened by Kuo, who in his turn drew off without\r\nstriking a blow.\r\n\r\nThus Lü Pu was baited till his bosom was near bursting with rage. The\r\nsame tactics continued for several days. He could neither strike his\r\nenemies nor escape them; his men had no rest.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these distracting manœuvres a messenger rode up in hot\r\nhaste to say that the capital was in imminent danger from a double\r\nattack. He at once ordered a march to save the capital, which became a\r\nrout when both his opponents came in pursuit. His loss was heavy.\r\n\r\nHe soon reached Chʻangan and found the rebels there in enormous numbers\r\nand the city quite surrounded. Lü Pu’s attack had but little effect and\r\nas his temper became more savage under defeat many of his men went over\r\nto the rebels.\r\n\r\nHe fell into deep melancholy. Then a remnant of Tung Cho’s adherents\r\nstill in the city, led by Li Mêng and Wang Fang, began to lend aid to\r\nthe attackers and by and by they secretly opened the city gate and the\r\nbesiegers poured in. Lü Pu exerted himself to the utmost but could not\r\nstem the tide. At the head of a few horse he dashed over to the Chingso\r\nGate, or “Gate of the Black Lock,” and called out to Wang Yün, who was\r\non the other side, that the case was desperate and bade him mount and\r\nride to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nWang Yün replied, “If I am gifted with the holy spirit of the State I\r\nshall succeed in restoring the tranquillity which I desire, but if I\r\nhave it not, then I offer my body a sacrifice. I will not quail before\r\ndangers. Thank the noble supporters east of the pass for their efforts\r\nand bid them remember their country.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu urged him again and again, but he would not leave. Soon flames\r\nstarted up all over the city and Lü Pu had to leave, abandoning his\r\nfamily to their fate. He fled and joined Yüan Shu.\r\n\r\nLi Tsʻui and his fellow leaders gave full licence to their ruffians,\r\nwho robbed and murdered their fill. Many high officers perished. In\r\ntime they penetrated to the inner palace and the eunuchs begged the\r\nEmperor to proceed to the Hsüanpʻing Mên (the Gate of Pervading Peace)\r\nto try to quell the rioting. At sight of the yellow umbrella Li Tsʻui\r\nand Kuo Ssŭ checked their men and they all shouted “Long life O\r\nEmperor!” (Wan-sui!). The Emperor stood by the tower and addressed\r\nthem, “Nobles, what means it that you enter the capital in this unruly\r\nmanner and without my summons?”\r\n\r\nThe two leaders looked up and said, “Tung Cho, Your Majesty’s Minister,\r\nhas been slain by Wang Yün and we are here to avenge him. We are no\r\nrebels, Sire. Let us only have Wang Yün and we draw off our men.”\r\n\r\nWang Yün was actually among the courtiers and at the Emperor’s side.\r\nHearing this demand he said, “The plan was made for the benefit of the\r\nThrone, but as this evil has grown therefrom Your Majesty will not\r\ngrudge losing me. I have brought about evil and I will go down to these\r\nrebels.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was torn with sorrow and wavered. But the faithful Minister\r\nleaped from the wall crying, “Wang Yün is here.”\r\n\r\nThe two leaders drew their swords, crying, “For what crime was our\r\nmaster slain?\r\n\r\n“His crimes filled the heavens and covered the earth; no tongue can\r\ntell them. The day he died was a day of rejoicing in the whole city as\r\nyou well know,” said Wang.\r\n\r\n“And if he was guilty of some crime what had we done not to be\r\nforgiven?”\r\n\r\n“Seditious rebels, why bandy words? I am ready to die.”\r\n\r\nAnd he was slain at the foot of the tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Moved by the people’s sufferings,\r\n        Vexed at his prince’s grief,\r\n        Wang Yün compassed the traitor’s death,\r\n        That they might find relief.\r\n        Every one knows him a hero,\r\n        Leal to the State alway:\r\n        Living he guarded the princely towers,\r\n        His soul keeps guard to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done the loyal Minister to death at his master’s feet they\r\nproceeded to exterminate also his whole family. Every one mourned.\r\n\r\nThen said the ruffians to each other, “Having gone so far what could be\r\nbetter than to make away with the Emperor and complete our scheme?”\r\n\r\n\r\n        The traitor condoned his crime,\r\n            Rebellion ought to cease;\r\n        But his licentious followers\r\n        Disturb the Empire’s peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Emperor will be disclosed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMA TʻENG SERVES HIS COUNTRY WELL:\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO AVENGES HIS FATHER’S MURDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter the two arch rebels proposed to murder the Emperor\r\nHsien, but their followers Chang and Fan opposed this.\r\n\r\n“No; the people will not approve of his death now. Restore him to power\r\nand get the leaguers inside the gates. Remove his supporters and then\r\nwe can compass his death. And we shall be able to do what we wish.”\r\n\r\nSo they ceased the attack. The Emperor again spoke from the tower,\r\nsaying, “Why do you still remain? You have slain Wang Yün now withdraw\r\nthese soldiers.”\r\n\r\nThen Li and Kuo replied, “Your servants desire rank us a reward for\r\ntheir good service to your dynasty.”\r\n\r\n“And what rank, Sirs?”\r\n\r\nAll four wrote their wishes and handed them up to the Emperor who had\r\nno choice but to accede to the request and they were created “Generals”\r\n(Chiang-chün) and received ranks of nobility and thereupon they went\r\naway and camped at Ssŭnung. The inferior leaders also were gratified\r\nwith ranks. And once more the capital was free of troops.\r\n\r\nTung Cho’s followers having so far succeeded did not forget their late\r\nleader. They sought his corpse for burial, but only a few fragments\r\nwere discoverable. Then they graved an image of fragrant wood in his\r\nlikeness, laid that out in proper form and instituted a noble’s\r\nsacrifices and prayers. The remains were dressed in the robes of a\r\nprince laid in a princely coffin for burial. They selected Meiwu for\r\nhis tomb and having found an auspicious day conveyed the coffin\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nBut a terrific thunder storm came on at the time of inhumation and the\r\nground was flooded. The coffin was riven asunder and the poor remains\r\nthrown out. A second time they buried the coffin, but a similar thing\r\nhappened in the night. And yet a third time in another place but the\r\nearth rejected the remains. Meanwhile the thunder-fire had entirely\r\nconsumed them. So it may be said justly that Heaven was exceeding angry\r\nwith Tung Cho.\r\n\r\nSo now Li Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ wielded the real power of the sceptre and\r\nthey were hard upon the people. They also removed the attendants from\r\nthe palace and replaced them by their own creatures, who maintained a\r\nmost perfect watch over every movement of the Emperor so that he was\r\ngreatly hampered and embarrassed. All appointments were made by the\r\nlate rebels. For the sake of popularity they especially summoned Chu\r\nChien to court, made him a High Chamberlain and associated him with the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOne day came a report that Ma Tʻêng, the Prefect of Hsiliang, and Han\r\nSui, with ten legions, were rapidly approaching the capital with the\r\nintention of attacking the rebels.\r\n\r\nNow these men from the west had laid careful plans. They had sent\r\ntrusty friends to the capital to find out who would support them. They\r\nhad conspired with three officials to be their inside allies and plot\r\nagainst the rebels. These three obtained from the throne two secret\r\nedicts conferring the ranks of Commander, “Conqueror of the West,” on\r\nMa Tʻêng and Commander, “Warden of the West,” on Han Sui. With these\r\npowers the two officials joined forces and began their march.\r\n\r\nThe four leaders of the party in power held a consultation as to how to\r\nmeet the attack. The adviser, Chia Hsü, said, “Since the attackers are\r\ncoming from a distance our plan is to fortify and wait till shortage of\r\nfood shall work for us. In a hundred days their supplies will be\r\nconsumed and they must retire. We can pursue and we shall capture\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nLi Mêng and Wang Fang rose and said, “This plan is bad. Give us a\r\nlegion and we will put an end to both of them and offer their heads\r\nbefore your ensign.”\r\n\r\n“To fight forthwith means defeat,” said the adviser.\r\n\r\nThe other two cried with one voice, “If we fail we are willing to lose\r\nour heads, but if we win then your head is forfeit.”\r\n\r\nChia Hsü then said, “Two hundred li west of the capital stand the\r\nChouchih Hills. The passes are narrow and difficult. Send Generals\r\nChang and Fan to occupy this point of vantage and fortify themselves so\r\nthat they may support Li and Wang.”\r\n\r\nLi Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ accepted this advice. They told off a legion and a\r\nhalf of horse and foot and Li and Wang left. They made a camp two\r\nhundred and eighty li from Chʻangan.\r\n\r\nThe force from the west arrived and the two officers led out their men\r\nto the attack. They found their opponents in battle array. The two\r\nleaders, Ma Tʻêng and Han Sui, rode to the front side by side. Pointing\r\nto the rebel leaders they abused them, calling them traitors and asking\r\nwho would capture them.\r\n\r\nHardly were the words spoken when there came out a youth with a clear,\r\nwhite complexion, eyes like shooting stars, lithe of body and strong of\r\nlimb. He was armed with a long spear and bestrode an excellent steed.\r\nThis young leader was Ma Chʻao, son of Ma Tʻêng, then seventeen years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nThough young he was valiant and skilful. Wang Fang, despising him on\r\naccount of his youth, galloped forth to fight him. Before they had\r\nexchanged many passes Wang Fang was disabled and fell to a thrust of\r\nthe young man’s spear. The victor turned to retire into the formation,\r\nbut Li Mêng rode after him to avenge his fallen colleague. Ma Chʻao did\r\nnot see him, but his father called out “You are followed!” Hardly had\r\nhe spoken when he saw that the pursuer was a prisoner seated on his\r\nson’s steed.\r\n\r\nNow Ma Chʻao had known he was followed, but pretended not to see,\r\nwaiting till his enemy should have come close and lifted his spear to\r\nstrike. Then he suddenly wheeled about. The spear thrust met only empty\r\nair, and as the horses passed Ma Chʻao’s powerful arm shot out and\r\npulled Wang Fang from the saddle. Thus the soldiers were left\r\nleaderless and fled in all directions. The army dashed in pursuit and a\r\ncomplete victory was scored. They pressed into the pass and made a\r\ncamp. They decapitated Li Mêng and exposed his head.\r\n\r\nWhen Li Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ heard that both the boastful captains had\r\nfallen under the hand of one young man they knew that Chia Hsü had\r\ngiven good advice and was gifted with clear prescience. So they valued\r\nhis plans the more highly and decided to act on the defensive. They\r\nrefused all challenges to combat.\r\n\r\nSurely enough after a couple of months the supplies of the Hsiliang men\r\nwere all exhausted and the leaders began to consider retreat.\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture a household servant of Ma Yü’s family betrayed\r\nhis master and told of the conspiracy of the three men to assist the\r\nattackers. The two chief rebels in revenge seized the three\r\nconspirators, with every member of their households, and beheaded them\r\nin the market place. The heads of the three were exposed at the gate.\r\n\r\nBeing short of food and hearing of the destruction of their three\r\nadherents in the city, the only course for Ma and Han was to retreat.\r\nAt once Chang Chi went in pursuit of Ma Tʻêng and Fan Chʻou followed\r\nHan Sui. The retreating army under Ma was beaten and only by Ma Chʻao’s\r\ndesperate efforts were the pursuers driven off.\r\n\r\nFan Chʻou pursued the other army and when he had come close Han Sui\r\nrode boldly up and addressed him, saying “You and I, Sir, are fellow\r\nvillagers. Why then behave so unfriendly?”\r\n\r\nChʻou replied, “I must obey the commands of my chief.”\r\n\r\n“I am here for the service of the State; why do you press me so hard?”\r\nsaid Han.\r\n\r\nAt this Fan Chʻou turned his horse, called in his men and left him in\r\npeace. Unwittingly a nephew of Li Tsʻui had been a witness of this\r\nscene and when he saw the enemy allowed to go free he returned and told\r\nhis uncle. Angry that his enemy had escaped, Li would have wreaked\r\nvengeance on his lieutenant, but his adviser again came in saying it\r\nwas dangerous to provoke another war. He proposed inviting the\r\ndefaulting officer to a banquet and, while the feast was in progress,\r\nexecuting him for dereliction of duty. This seemed good to Li so the\r\nbanquet was prepared. The two officers accepted their invitations and\r\nwent cheerfully. Toward the latter part of the entertainment a sudden\r\nchange came over their host and he suddenly asked Fan Chʻou, “Why have\r\nyou been intriguing with Han Sui? You are turning traitor, eh?”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy guest was taken aback and before he could frame his words\r\nto reply he saw the assassins rush out with swords and axes. In a\r\nmoment all was over and his head lay beneath the table.\r\n\r\nScared beyond measure his fellow-guest grovelled on the floor. “He was\r\na traitor,” said the host, raising him by the arm, “and he has his\r\ndeserts; you are my friend and need not fear.”\r\n\r\nHe gave Chang Chi command of the murdered man’s troop with which he\r\nreturned to Hungnung. No one of the nobles among the leaguers dared\r\nattempt an attack on the party newly risen from Tung Cho’s\r\ndisaffection, while on the other hand Chia Hsü never ceased to urge his\r\nmasters to exert themselves for the welfare of the people and thus to\r\ntempt wise men to join them. And by these means the government began to\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\nHowever, a new trouble arose in the shape of a resurgence of Yellow\r\nTurbans. They came, without apparent head or leader, in large numbers\r\nand plundered any place they reached. Chu Chien said he knew of one who\r\ncould destroy this sedition, and when asked who was the man he proposed\r\nhe said, “You want to destroy this horde of rebels; you will fail\r\nunless you get the services of Tsʻao Mêng-tê.”\r\n\r\n“And where is he?” asked Li Tsʻui.\r\n\r\n“He is Prefect of Tung Chün. He has a large army and you have only to\r\norder him to act; the rising will be broken.”\r\n\r\nA messenger went post haste with a command for Tsʻao Tsʻao and Pao Hsin\r\nto act together in quelling the rebellion. As soon as Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nreceived the court command he arranged with his colleague first to\r\nattack the rebels at Shouyang. Pao Hsin made a dash right into their\r\nmidst, inflicting damage wherever he could, and Tsʻao Tsʻao pursued\r\nthem as they fled. So many surrendered. Then he put his quondam enemies\r\nin the van and when his army reached any place many more surrendered\r\nand joined him. After three months of these tactics they had won over\r\nmany thousands, both of soldiers and ordinary folk.\r\n\r\nOf these new adherents the strongest and boldest were made soldiers and\r\nthe others were sent home to their fields. In consequence of these\r\nsuccesses Tsʻao Tsʻao’s prestige and fame became very great and\r\nincreased daily. He reported his success to the capital and was\r\nrewarded with the title of Commander, “Warden of the East.”\r\n\r\nAt his headquarters in Yenchow Tsʻao Tsʻao welcomed wise counsellors\r\nand bold warriors, and many gathered around him. Two clever men, uncle\r\nand nephew, came at the same time, both Yingchow men, named Hsün Yü and\r\nHsün Yu. The uncle had once been in the service of Yüan Shao. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao rejoiced when he had won the elder Hsün to his side saying he was\r\nhis teacher. The nephew was famed for his ability and had been in the\r\ncourt service but had abandoned that career and retired to his village.\r\n\r\nThe uncle said to Tsʻao Tsʻao, “There is a certain wise man of Yenchow\r\nsomewhere, but I do not know in whose service he is.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Chʻêng Yü; he belongs to the eastern district.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have heard of him,” said Tsʻao. So a messenger was sent to his\r\nnative place to enquire. He was away in the hills engaged in study, but\r\nhe came at Tsʻao Tsʻao’s invitation.\r\n\r\n“I shall prove unworthy of your recommendation,” said he to his friend\r\nHsün, “for I am rough and ignorant. But have you forgotten a fellow\r\nvillager of yours, Kuo Chia? He is really able. Why not spread the net\r\nto catch him?”\r\n\r\n“I had nearly forgotten,” said Hsün Yü suddenly. So he told his master\r\nof this man, who was at once invited. Kuo, discussing the world at\r\nlarge with his master, spoke in high terms of one Liu Yeh; and when he\r\nhad arrived he was the means of inviting two more, Man Chʻung and Lü\r\nChʻien, who were already known to Tsʻao Tsʻao by reputation. These two\r\nbrought to their new master’s notice the name of Mao Chieh, who also\r\ncame and was given office. Then a famous leader, with his troop of some\r\nhundreds, arrived to offer service. This was Yü Chin of Tʻaishan, an\r\nexpert horseman and archer, and skilled beyond his fellows in every\r\nform of military exercise. He was made an army inspector.\r\n\r\nThen another day Hsiahou Tun brought a really fine, handsome fellow to\r\npresent to Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“He is from Chʻên-liu and is named Tien Wei. He is the boldest of the\r\nbold, the strongest of the strong. He was one of Chang Mo’s men, but\r\nquarrelled with his tent companions and killed a lot of them with his\r\nfists. Then he fled to the mountains where I found him. I was out\r\nshooting and saw him follow a tiger across a stream. I persuaded him to\r\njoin my troop and I recommend him.”\r\n\r\n“I see he is no ordinary man,” said Tsʻao. “He is handsome and straight\r\nand looks very powerful and bold.”\r\n\r\n“He is. He killed a man once to avenge a friend and carried his head\r\nthrough the whole market place. Hundreds saw him, but dared not come\r\nnear. The weapon he uses now is a two-branched spear over a hundred\r\npounds in weight, and he vaults into the saddle with this under his\r\narm.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao bade the man give proof of his skill so he galloped to and\r\nfro carrying the spear. Then he saw away among the tents a huge banner\r\nswaying dangerously with the force of the wind and on the point of\r\nfalling. A crowd of soldiers were vainly struggling to keep it steady.\r\nDown he leaped, shouted to the men to clear out and held the staff\r\nquite steady with one hand, keeping it perfectly upright in spite of\r\nthe strong wind.\r\n\r\n“This is old Wu Lai again,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. He gave the strong man a\r\npost in the army and besides made him presents of an embroidered robe\r\nand a swift steed with a handsome saddle.\r\n\r\nThus Tsʻao Tsʻao encouraged able men to assist him and he had advisers\r\non the civil side and valiant captains in the army. He became famous\r\nthrough all Shantung.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s father, Sung, was living at Langya, whither he had gone as a\r\nplace free from the turmoil of the partizan struggles and, as a dutiful\r\nson, Tsʻao sent the Prefect of Tʻaishan to escort his father to\r\nYenchow. The old man read the letter with joy and the family prepared\r\nto move. They were some forty in all, with a train of a hundred\r\nservants and many carts.\r\n\r\nTheir road led through Hsüchou where the Prefect, Tʻao Chʻien, was a\r\nsincere and upright man who had long wished to get on good terms with\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao but, hitherto, had found no means of effecting a bond of\r\nunion. Hearing that the family of the great man was passing through his\r\ndistrict he went to welcome them, treated them with great cordiality,\r\nfeasting and entertaining them for two days, and when they left he\r\nescorted them to his boundary. Further he sent with them one Chang Kʻai\r\nwith a special escort.\r\n\r\nThe whole party reached Huafei. It was the end of summer, just turning\r\ninto autumn, and at this place they were stopped by a tremendous storm\r\nof rain. The only shelter was an old temple and thither they went. The\r\nfamily occupied the main rooms and the escort the two side wings. The\r\nmen of the escort were drenched, angry and discontented. The leader\r\ncalled some of his petty officers to a secret spot and said, “We are\r\nold Yellow Turbans and only submitted to Tʻao because there was no help\r\nfor it. We have never got much out of it. Now here is the Tsʻao family\r\nwith no end of gear and we can be rich very easily. We will make a\r\nsudden onslaught to-night at the third watch and slay the whole lot.\r\nThen we shall have plenty of treasure and we will get away to the\r\nmountains.”\r\n\r\nThey all agreed. The storm continued into the night and as Tsʻao Sung\r\nsat waiting anxiously for signs of clearing he suddenly heard a hubbub\r\nat the west end of the temple. His brother Tsʻao Tê, drawing his sword,\r\nwent out to see what it was about and was at once cut down. Tsʻao Sung\r\nseized one of the concubines by the hand, rushed with her through the\r\npassage toward the back of the temple so that they might escape. But\r\nthe lady was stout and could not get through the narrow doors so the\r\ntwo hid in one of the small outhouses at the side. However, they were\r\nseen and slain.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Prefect fled for his life to Yüan Shao. The murderers fled\r\ninto Huainan with their plunder after having set fire to the old\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tsʻao Tsʻao, whom the ages praise,\r\n        Slew the Lüs in former days;\r\n        Nemesis ne’er turns aside,\r\n        Murdered too his family died.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the escort escaped and took the evil tidings to Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\nWhen he heard it he fell to the earth with a great cry. They raised\r\nhim. With set teeth he muttered, “His men have slain my father: no\r\nlonger can the same sky cover us. I will sweep Hsüchou off the face of\r\nthe earth. Only thus can I satisfy my vengeance.”\r\n\r\nLeaving one small army to guard the east he set forth with all the\r\nremainder to destroy Hsüchou and avenge his father.\r\n\r\nNow the Prefect of Kiukiang was a close friend of Tʻao Chʻien. Hearing\r\nHsüchou was threatened he set out with half a legion to his friend’s\r\naid. Tsʻao sent Hsiahou Tun to cut him off while still on the march. At\r\nthis time Chʻên Kung was in office in the east and he was also on\r\nfriendly terms with Tʻao. Hearing of Tsʻao’s design to destroy the\r\nwhole population he came in haste to see his former companion. Tsʻao\r\nknowing his errand put him off at first and would not see him. But he\r\ncould not forget the kindness he had formerly received and presently\r\nthe visitor was called to his tent.\r\n\r\nChʻên Kung said, “They say you go to avenge your father’s death on\r\nHsüchou, to destroy its people. I have come to say a word. The Prefect\r\nis humane and a good man. He is not looking out for his own advantage,\r\ncareless of the means and of others. Your worthy father met his unhappy\r\ndeath at the hands of Chang Kʻai. Tʻao Chʻien is guiltless. Still more\r\ninnocent are the people and to slay them would be an evil. I pray you\r\nto think over it.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao retorted angrily, “You once abandoned me and now you have the\r\nimpudence to come to see me! Tʻao Chien slew my whole family and I will\r\ntear his heart out in revenge. I swear it. You may speak for your\r\nfriend and say what you will. I shall be as if I heard not.”\r\n\r\nIntercession had failed. He sighed and took his leave. “Alas! I cannot\r\ngo to Tʻao and look upon his face.” So he rode off to the Chʻên-liu\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s army of revenge laid waste whatever place it passed\r\nthrough, slaying the people and desecrating their cemeteries.\r\n\r\nWhen Tʻao Chʻien heard the terrible tidings he looked up to heaven\r\nsaying, “I must be guilty of some fault before Heaven to have brought\r\nthis evil upon my people.” He called together his officials to consult.\r\nOne of them, Tsʻao Pao, said, “Now the enemy is upon us, we cannot sit\r\nand await death with folded hands. I for one will help you to make me a\r\nfight.”\r\n\r\nThe army went out. From a distance the enemy spread abroad like hoar\r\nfrost and rushed far and wide like snow. In their midst was a large\r\nwhite flag and oh both sides was written “Vengeance.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had ranged his men Tsʻao Tsʻao rode out dressed in mourning\r\nwhite and abused Tʻao Chʻien. But Tʻao advanced and from beneath his\r\nensign bowed low and said, “I wished to make friends with you,\r\nIllustrious Sir, and so I sent Chang Kʻai to escort your family. I knew\r\nnot that his rebel heart was still unchanged. The fault does not lie at\r\nmy door as you must see.”\r\n\r\n“You old fool, you killed my father and now you dare to mumble this\r\nnonsense,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. And he asked who would go out and seize\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHsiahou Tun undertook this service and rode out. The Prefect fled to\r\nthe inner portion of his array and as Hsiahou Tun came on Tsʻao Pao\r\nwent to meet him. But just as the two horses met a hurricane burst over\r\nthe spot and the flying dust and pebbles threw both sides into the\r\nutmost confusion. Both drew off.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect retired into the city and called his officers to council.\r\n“The force against us is too strong,” said he. “I will give myself up\r\nas a prisoner and let him wreak his vengeance on me. I may save the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nBut a voice was heard saying, “You have long ruled here and the people\r\nlove you. Strong as the enemy are they are not necessarily able to\r\nbreak down our walls, especially when defended by you and your people.\r\nI have a scheme to suggest that I think will make Tsʻao Tsʻao die in a\r\nplace where he will not find burial.”\r\n\r\nThese bold words startled the assembly and they eagerly asked what the\r\nscheme was.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Making overtures for friendship he encountered deadly hate,\r\n    But, where danger seemed most threatening, he discovered safety’s\r\n                                                                  gate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will disclose who the speaker was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLIU, THE EMPEROR’S UNCLE, RESCUES KʻUNG JUNG:\r\nLU, MARQUIS OF WEN, DEFEATS TSʻAO TSʻAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one Mi Chu who said he knew how to defeat Tsʻao Tsʻao utterly.\r\nHe came of a wealthy family of merchants trading in Loyang. One day\r\ntravelling homeward from that city in a carriage he met an exquisitely\r\nbeautiful lady trudging along the road, who asked him to let her ride.\r\nHe stopped and yielded his place to her. She invited him to share the\r\nseat with her. He mounted, but sat rigidly upright never even glancing\r\nin her direction. They travelled thus for some miles when she thanked\r\nhim and alighted. Just as she left she said, “I am the embodied spirit\r\nof the Southern Heat. I am on my way to execute a decree of the Supreme\r\nto burn your dwelling, but your extreme courtesy has so deeply touched\r\nme that I now warn you. Hasten homeward, remove your valuables for I\r\nmust arrive to-night.”\r\n\r\nThereupon she disappeared. Mi Chu hastily finished his journey and as\r\nsoon as he arrived moved everything out of his house. Sure enough that\r\nnight a fire started in the kitchen and involved the whole house. After\r\nthis he devoted his wealth to relieving the poor and comforting the\r\nafflicted. Tʻao Chʻien gave him the office he then held.\r\n\r\nThe plan he proposed was this. “I will go to Pohai and beg Kʻung Jung\r\nto help; another should go to Chʻingchow on a similar mission, and if\r\nthe armies of these two places march on our enemy he will certainly\r\nretire.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect accepted the plan and wrote letters. He asked for a\r\nvolunteer to go to Chʻingchow and a certain Chʻên Têng offered himself\r\nand, after he had left, Mi Chu was formally entrusted with the mission\r\nto the north. Meanwhile they would hold the city as they could.\r\n\r\nThis Kʻung was a native of Chʻüfou in the old state of Lü, one of the\r\ntwentieth generation in descent from the great Teacher Confucius. He\r\nhad been noted as a very intelligent lad, somewhat precocious. When ten\r\nyears old he had gone to see Li Ying, the Governor, but the doorkeeper\r\ndemurred to letting him in. But when he said, “I am Minister Li’s\r\nintimate friend,” he was admitted. Li asked him what relations had\r\nexisted between their families that might justify the term intimate.\r\nThe boy replied, “Of old my ancestor (Kʻung) questioned yours (Lao Tzŭ,\r\nwhose name was Li Erh) concerning ceremonies. So our families have\r\nknown each other for many generations.” His host was astonished at the\r\nboy’s ready wit.\r\n\r\nPresently another visitor of high rank came in, to whom Li Ying told\r\nthe story of his youthful guest. “He is a wonder, this boy,” said Li.\r\n\r\nThe visitor replied, “It does not follow that a clever boy grows up\r\ninto a clever man.”\r\n\r\nThe lad took him up at once saying “By what you say, Sir, you were\r\ncertainly one of the clever boys.”\r\n\r\nThey all laughed. “The boy is going to be a noble vessel,” said they.\r\n\r\nThus from boyhood he was famous. As a man he rose to be a Chung-lang\r\nChiang, and was sent as Governor to Pohai, where he was renowned for\r\nhospitality. He used to quote the lines:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        “Let the rooms be full of friends,\r\n        And the cups be full of wine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is what I like,” said he.\r\n\r\nAfter six years at Pohai the people were devoted to him. The day that\r\nMi Chu arrived he was, as usual, seated among his guests and the\r\nmessenger was ushered in without delay. In reply to a question about\r\nthe reason of the visit he presented his letter which said that Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao was pressing on the city and the Prefect prayed for help.\r\n\r\nThen said Kʻung Jung, “Your master and I are good friends and your\r\npresence here constrains me to go to his aid. However I have no quarrel\r\nwith Tsʻao Mêng-tê either, so I will first write to him to try to make\r\npeace. If he refuses my offer, then I must set the army in motion.”\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao will not listen to proposals of peace; he is too certain\r\nof his strength,” said the messenger.\r\n\r\nKʻung Jung wrote his letter and also gave orders to muster his men.\r\nJust at this moment happened another rising of the Yellow Turbans, and\r\nthe ruffians began to rob and murder at Pohai. It was necessary to deal\r\nwith them first and Kʻung led his army outside the city.\r\n\r\nThe rebel leader rode out to the front saying, “I know this district is\r\nfruitful and can well spare ten thousand ‘stone’ of grain. Give me that\r\nand we retire: refuse, and we will batter down the city walls and\r\ndestroy every soul.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect shouted back, “I am a servant of the great Hans, entrusted\r\nwith the safety of their land. Think you I will feed rebels?”\r\n\r\nThe leader Kuan Hai whipped his steed, whirled his sword around his\r\nhead and rode forward. Tsung Pao, one of Kʻung’s captains, set his\r\nspear and rode out to give him battle, but after a very few bouts was\r\ncut down. Soon the soldiers fell into confusion and rushed pell-mell\r\ninto the city for protection. The rebels then laid seige to the city on\r\nall sides. Kʻung Jung was very down-hearted and Mi Chu, who now saw no\r\nhope for the success of his mission, was grieved beyond words.\r\n\r\nThe sight from the city wall was exceeding sad, for the rebels were\r\nthere in enormous numbers. One day as the Prefect stood on the wall, he\r\nsaw a man armed with a spear riding hard in among his enemies and\r\nscattering them before him like chaff before the wind. Before long he\r\nhad reached the foot of the wall and called out, “Open the gate!” But\r\nthe defenders would not open to an unknown man and in the delay a crowd\r\nof rebels gathered round the rider along the edge of the moat. Suddenly\r\nwheeling about, the warrior dashed in among them and bowled over half a\r\nscore at which the others fell back. At this the Prefect ordered the\r\nwardens to open the gates and let the stranger enter. As soon as he was\r\ninside he dismounted, laid aside his spear, ascended the wall and made\r\nhumble obeisance to Kʻung Jung.\r\n\r\nHe said his name was Tʻaishih Tz’ŭ and he came from Laihuang. His aged\r\nmother had sent him out of gratitude for the kindness shown her by\r\nKʻung. “I only returned home yesterday from the north and then I heard\r\nthat your city was in danger from a rebel attack. My mother said you\r\nhad been very kind to her and told me I should try to help. So I set\r\nout all alone and here I am.”\r\n\r\nThis was cheering. The Prefect already knew Tʻaishih by reputation as a\r\nvaliant fighting man although they two had never met. The son being far\r\naway from his home the Prefect had taken his mother, who dwelt a few\r\nmiles from the city, under his especial protection and saw that she did\r\nnot suffer from want. This had won the old lady’s heart and she had\r\nsent her son to show her gratitude.\r\n\r\nKʻung showed his appreciation by treating his guest with the greatest\r\nrespect, making him presents of clothing and armour, saddles and\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nPresently said Tʻaishih, “Give me a company and I will go out and drive\r\noff these fellows.”\r\n\r\n“You are a bold warrior, but these are very numerous. It is a serious\r\nmatter to go out among them,” said Kʻung.\r\n\r\n“My mother sent me because of your goodness to her. How shall I be able\r\nto look her in the face if I do not raise the siege? I would prefer to\r\nconquer or perish.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard Liu Yüan-tê is one of the finest warriors in the world\r\nand if we could get his help there would be no doubt of the result. But\r\nthere is no one to send.”\r\n\r\n“I will go as soon as I have received your letter.”\r\n\r\nSo Kʻung wrote letters and gave them to his new helper. Tʻaishih put on\r\nhis armour, mounted his steed, attached his bow and quiver to his\r\ngirdle, took his spear in his hand, tied his packed haversack firmly to\r\nhis saddle bow and rode out at the city gate. He went quite alone.\r\n\r\nAlong the moat a large party of the besiegers were gathered and they\r\ncame to intercept the solitary rider. But he dashed in among them and\r\ncut down several and so finally fought his way through.\r\n\r\nThe rebel leader, hearing that a rider had left the city, guessed what\r\nhis errand would be and followed Tʻaishih with a party of horsemen. He\r\nspread them out so that the messenger rider was entirely surrounded.\r\nThen Tʻaishih laid aside his spear, took his bow, adjusted his arrows\r\none by one and shot all round him. And as a rider fell from his steed\r\nwith every twang of his bowstring, the pursuers dared not close in.\r\n\r\nThus he got clear away and rode in hot haste to Liu Yüan-tê. He reached\r\nPʻingyüan and after greeting his host in proper form he told how Kʻung\r\nPohai was surrounded and had sent him for help. Then he presented the\r\nletter which Liu Pei read.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“I am Tʻaishih Tz’ŭ, a stupid fellow from Tunghai. I am not related by\r\nties of kin to Kʻung Jung, nor even by ties of neighbourhood, but I am\r\nby the bonds of sentiment and I share his sorrows and misfortunes. The\r\nrebel Kuan has invested his city and he is distressed with none to turn\r\nto and destruction is very near. You are known as humane and righteous\r\nand you are able to rescue him. Therefore at his command I have braved\r\nall dangers and fought my way through his enemies to pray you to save\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nLiu Yüan-tê smiled, saying, “And does he know of my existence?”\r\n\r\nSo the three brothers told off three companies and set out to help\r\nraise the siege. When the rebel leader saw these new forces arriving he\r\nled out his army to fight them, thinking he could easily dispose of so\r\nsmall a force.\r\n\r\nThe brothers and Tʻaishih Tz’ŭ with them sat on their horses in the\r\nforefront of their array. Kuan Hai, the rebel leader, hastened forward.\r\nTʻaishih held back to allow Kuan Yü to open the combat. He rode forth\r\nand the two steeds met. The soldiers set up a great shout, for how\r\ncould there be any doubt of the result? After a few bouts Black Dragon\r\nrose and fell, and with the stroke fell the rebel leader.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for the two other warriors to take a share and they\r\nadvanced side by side. With their spears ready they dashed in and\r\nYüan-tê urged forward his men. The besieged Prefect saw his doughty\r\nrescuers laying low the rebels as tigers among a flock of sheep. None\r\ncould withstand them and he then sent out his own men to join in the\r\nbattle so that the rebels were between two armies. The rebels’ force\r\nwas completely broken and many men surrendered, while the remainder\r\nscattered in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe victors were welcomed into the city and as soon as possible a\r\nbanquet was prepared in their honour. Mi Chu was presented to Liu\r\nYüan-tê and he related the story of the murder of Tsʻao Sung by Chang\r\nKʻai and Tsʻao’s vengeful attack on Hsüchou and his coming to beg for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “Tʻao Kung-tsu is a kindly man of high character, and it\r\nis a pity that he should suffer this wrong for no fault of his own.”\r\n\r\n“You are a scion of the imperial family,” said the Prefect, “and this\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao is injuring the people, a strong man abusing his strength.\r\nWhy not go with me to rescue the sufferers?”\r\n\r\n“I dare not refuse, but my force is weak and I must act cautiously,”\r\nsaid Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Though my desire to help arises from an old friendship, yet it is a\r\nrighteous act as well. Is it that your heart is not inclined toward the\r\nright?” said Kʻung.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei said, “This being so, you go first and give me time to see\r\nKungsun Tsan from whom I may borrow more men and horses. I will come\r\nanon.”\r\n\r\n“You surely will not break your promise?” said the Prefect.\r\n\r\n“What manner of man think you that I am?” said Yüan-tê. “The wise one\r\nsaid, ‘Death is common to all: the man without truth cannot maintain\r\nhimself.’ Whether I get the men or not, certainly I shall myself come.”\r\n\r\nSo the plan was agreed to. Mi Chu set out to return forthwith while\r\nKʻung Jung prepared for his expedition.\r\n\r\nTʻaishih Tz’ŭ took his leave saying, “My mother bade me come to your\r\naid and now happily you are safe. Letters have come from my fellow\r\ntownsman, Liu Yu, Governor of Yangchou, calling me thither and I must\r\ngo. I will see you again.”\r\n\r\nKʻung pressed rewards upon him but he would accept nothing and went\r\naway. When his mother saw him she was pleased at his success saying she\r\nrejoiced that he had been able to prove his gratitude, and after this\r\nhe departed for Yangchou.\r\n\r\nHere nothing will be said of the departure of the relieving force. But\r\nYüan-tê went away to his friend Kungsun Tsan and laid before him his\r\ndesign to help Hsüchou.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao and you are not enemies; why do you spend yourself for the\r\nsake of another?” said Tsan.\r\n\r\n“I have promised,” he replied, “and dare not break faith.”\r\n\r\n“I will lend you two companies, horse and foot,” said Tsan.\r\n\r\n“Also I wish to have the services of Chao Tzŭ-lung,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nTsan agreed to this also.\r\n\r\nThey marched away, their own men being in the front and Chao Tzŭ-lung,\r\nwith the borrowed men, being in rear.\r\n\r\nIn due course Mi Chu returned saying that Kʻung Jung had also obtained\r\nthe services of the three warrior brothers. The other messenger, Chʻên\r\nYüan-lung, came back and reported that Tʻien Kʻai would also bring\r\nhelp. Then was the Prefect’s heart set at ease.\r\n\r\nBut both the leaders, though they had promised aid, greatly dreaded\r\ntheir antagonist and camped among the hills at a great distance,\r\nfearful of coming to close quarters. Tsʻao Tsʻao knew of their coming\r\nand divided his army into parts to meet them, so postponing the attack\r\non the city itself. Presently Liu Pei came up and went to see Kʻung\r\nJung, who said, “The enemy is very powerful and Tsʻao Tsʻao handles his\r\narmy skilfully. We must be cautious. Let us make most careful\r\nobservations before we strike a blow.”\r\n\r\n“What I fear is famine in the city,” said Liu Pei. “They cannot hold\r\nout very long. I will put my men with yours under your command while I\r\nwith Chang Fei make a dash through to see Tʻao Chʻien and consult with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nKʻung Jung approved of this, so he and Tʻien Kʻai took up positions on\r\nthe “ox horn formation,” with Kuan Yü and Chao Yün on either side to\r\nsupport them.\r\n\r\nThe day that Liu Pei and his company made their dash to get through\r\nTsʻao’s army they got as far as the flank of his camp when there arose\r\na great beating of drums, and horse and foot rolled out like billows on\r\nthe ocean. The leader was Yü Chin. He checked his steed and called out,\r\n“You mad men from somewhere, where are you going?”\r\n\r\nChang Fei heard him but deigned no reply. He only rode straight to\r\nattack the speaker. After they had fought a few bouts Yüan-tê waved his\r\ndouble sword as signal for his men to come on and they drove Yü Chin\r\nbefore them. Chang Fei led the pursuit and in this way they reached the\r\ncity wall.\r\n\r\nFrom the city wall the besieged saw a huge banner embroidered in white\r\nwith the name of Liu Pei and the Prefect bade them open the gate for\r\nthe rescuers to enter. The leader was made very welcome, conducted to\r\nthe residency and a banquet prepared in his honour. The men also were\r\nfeasted.\r\n\r\nTʻao Chʻien was delighted with Liu Pei, admiring his noble appearance\r\nand clear speech. He bade Mi Chu offer him the seal and insignia of\r\noffice. But the visitor shrank back startled.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” said he.\r\n\r\nTʻao said, “There is trouble on every side and the kingly rule is no\r\nlonger maintained. You, Sir, are a member of the family and eminently\r\nfitted to support them and their prerogatives. I am verging on senility\r\nand I wish to retire in your favour. I pray you not to decline and I\r\nwill report my action to the Court.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei started up from his seat and bowed before his host saying,\r\n“Scion of the family I may be, but my merit is small and my virtue\r\nmeagre. I doubt my fitness even for my present post and only a feeling\r\nof doing right sent me to your assistance. To hear such speech makes me\r\ndoubt. Surely you think I came with greed in my heart. May God help me\r\nno more if I cherished such a thought.”\r\n\r\n“It is a poor old man’s real sentiment,” said Tʻao Chʻien.\r\n\r\nTime after time Tʻao Chʻien renewed his offer to retire, but how could\r\nLiu Pei accept it?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this came Mi Chu to say the enemies had reached the\r\nwall and something must be done to drive them off. The matter of one\r\nofficer retiring in favour of the other could await a more tranquil\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSaid Liu Pei, “I ought to write to Tsʻao Tsʻao to press him to raise\r\nthe siege. If he refuse, we will attack forthwith.”\r\n\r\nOrders were sent to the three camps to remain quiescent till the\r\nletters could reach Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Tsʻao Tsʻao was holding a council when a messenger\r\nwith a war letter was announced. The letter was brought in and handed\r\nto him and, when he had opened and looked at it, he found it was from\r\nLiu Pei.\r\n\r\nThis is the letter, very nearly:—“Since meeting you outside the pass,\r\nfate has assigned us to different quarters of the world and I have not\r\nbeen able to pay my respects to you. Touching the death of your noble\r\nfather, the Marquis, it was owing to the vicious nature of Chang Kʻai\r\nand due to no fault of Tʻao Kung-tsu. Now while the remnant of the\r\nYellow Turbans is disturbing the provinces and Tung Cho’s partizans\r\nhave the upper hand in the capital, I would that you, illustrious Sir,\r\nwould regard the critical position of the Court rather than your\r\npersonal grievances and so divert your forces from the attack on\r\nHsüchou to the rescue of the State. Such would be for the happiness of\r\nthat city and the whole world.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao gave vent to a torrent of abuse. “Who is this Liu Pei that\r\nhe dares write and exhort me? Beside, he means to be satirical.”\r\n\r\nHe issued orders to put the bearer of the letter to death and to press\r\non the siege. But Kuo Chia remonstrated, “Liu Pei has come from afar to\r\nhelp Tʻao and he is trying the effect of politeness before resorting to\r\narms. I pray you, my master, reply with fair words that his heart may\r\nbe lulled with a feeling of safety. Then attack with vigour and the\r\ncity will fall.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao found this advice good, so he spared the messenger telling him to\r\nwait to carry back his reply. While this was going on a horseman came\r\nwith news of misfortune. Lü Pu had made a raid on Yenchou.\r\n\r\nWhen Li and Kuo, the two partizans of Tung Cho, succeeded in their\r\nattack on the capital Lü Pu had fled to Yüan Shu, who however looked\r\naskance at him for his instability, and refused to receive him. Then he\r\nhad tried Yüan Shao, who had made use of him in an attack upon Chang\r\nYen in Chʻangshan. But his success filled him with pride and his\r\narrogant demeanour so annoyed the other commandants that Shao was on\r\nthe point of putting him to death. To escape this he had gone away to\r\nChang Yang, who accepted his services.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Pʻang Hsü, who had been protecting Lü’s family since\r\nhis disappearance, restored them to him, which deed angered Li and Kuo\r\nso that they put Pʻang to death and wrote to Lü Pu’s protector to serve\r\nhim the same. To escape this Lü Pu once again had to flee and this time\r\njoined himself to Chang Mo.\r\n\r\nHe arrived just as Chang Mo’s brother was introducing Chʻên Kung. Kung\r\nsaid to Mo, “The disrupture of the Empire has begun and warriors are\r\nseizing what they can. It is strange that you, with all the advantages\r\nyou enjoy, do not strike for independence. Tsʻao Tsʻao has gone on an\r\nexpedition against the east leaving his own district defenceless. Lü Pu\r\nis one of the fighting men of the day. If you and he together attacked\r\nand got Yenchow you could then proceed to the dominion.”\r\n\r\nChang Mo was pleased and resolved to try. Soon Lü Pu was in possession\r\nof Yenchou and its neighbourhood, all but three small departments,\r\nwhich were desperately defended. Tsʻao Jên had fought many battles but\r\nwas always defeated and the messenger with the evil tidings had come\r\nfrom him asking help.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was greatly disturbed by this and said, “If my own city be\r\nlost I have no home to return to. I must do something at once.”\r\n\r\n“The best thing would be to become friends with Liu Pei at any cost and\r\nreturn to Yenchou,” said Kuo Chia.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote to Liu Pei, gave the letter to the waiting messenger and\r\nbroke camp. The news that the enemy had left was very gratifying to the\r\nPrefect, who then invited his various defenders into the city and\r\nprepared banquets and feasts in token of his gratitude.\r\n\r\nAt one of these, when the feasting was over, he proceeded with his\r\nscheme of retirement in favour of Liu Pei. Placing him in the seat of\r\nhighest honour he bowed before him and then addressed the assembly.\r\n\r\n“I am old and feeble and my two sons lack the ability to hold so\r\nimportant an office as this. The noble Liu is a descendant of the\r\nimperial house. He is of lofty virtue and great talent. Let him then\r\ntake over the rule of this district and only too willingly I shall\r\nretire to have leisure to nurse my health.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “I came at the request of Kʻung Wên-chü because it was\r\nthe right thing to do. Hsüchou is saved, but if I take it surely the\r\nworld will say I am a wicked man.”\r\n\r\nMi Chu said, “You may not refuse. The House of Han is failing, their\r\nrealm is crumbling and now is the time for doughty deeds and signal\r\nservices. This is a fertile district, well populated, and you are the\r\nman to rule over it.”\r\n\r\n“But I dare not accept.”\r\n\r\n“The Prefect is a great sufferer,” said Chʻên Têng, “and cannot see to\r\nmatters. You may not decline, Sir.”\r\n\r\nSaid Yüan-tê, “Yüan Shu belongs to a family of rulers and the highest\r\noffices of state were held four times in three generations. The whole\r\nempire respects him, why not invite him to this task?”\r\n\r\n“Because he is a rotting bone in a dark tomb; not worth talking about.\r\nThis opportunity is a gift from Heaven and you will never cease to\r\nregret its loss,” said Kʻung.\r\n\r\nSo spake Kʻung Jung, but still Liu Pei obstinately refused. Tʻao Chʻien\r\nbesought him with tears. “I shall die if you leave me and there will be\r\nnone to close my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Brother, you should accept the offer thus made,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“Why so much fuss?” said Chang Fei. “We have not taken the place; it is\r\nhe who wishes to give it you.”\r\n\r\n“You all persuade me to do what is wrong,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nThrice did Tʻao entreat Liu Pei and thrice was he refused. Then he\r\nsaid, “As he is set in his determination perhaps he will consent to\r\nencamp at Hsiaopʻei. It is only a little town, but thence he can keep\r\nwatch and ward over this city.”\r\n\r\nThey all with one voice prayed Liu Pei to consent so he gave in. The\r\nfeast of victory being now ended the time came to say farewell. When\r\nChao Yün took his leave Liu Pei held his hands alternately while\r\ndashing away the falling tears. Kʻung Jung and his leader went home to\r\ntheir own place.\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei and his brothers took up their abode in Hsiaopʻei, they\r\nfirst repaired the defences and then they put out proclamations in\r\norder to calm the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Tsʻao Tsʻao had marched toward his own district. His\r\ncousin, Tsʻao Jên, met him and told him Lü Pu was very strong and he\r\nhad Chʻên Kung as adviser. Yenchou was as good as lost, with the\r\nexception of three small districts which had been desperately defended.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said, “I own that Lü Pu is a bold fighter but nothing more;\r\nhe has no craft. So we need not fear him seriously.”\r\n\r\nThen he gave orders to make a strong camp till they could think out\r\nsome victorious plan. Lü Pu, knowing of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s return, called\r\ntwo of his subordinate captains, Hsüeh Lan and Li Fêng, to him and\r\nassigned to them the task of holding Yenchou, saying “I have long\r\nwaited for opportunity to employ your skill: now I give you a legion\r\nand you are to hold the city while I go forth to attack Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nThey made no objection. But Chʻên Kung, the strategist, came in hastily\r\nsaying, “You are going away; whither?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to camp my men at Puyang, that vantage point.”\r\n\r\n“You are making a mistake,” said Chʻên Kung. “The two you have chosen\r\nto defend this are unequal to the task. For this expedition remember\r\nthat about one hundred and eighty li due south, on the road to\r\nTʻaishan, is a very advantageous position where you should place your\r\nbest men in ambush. Tsʻao Tsʻao will hasten homeward by double marches\r\nwhen he hears what has happened and if you strike when half his men\r\nhave gone past this point you may seize him.”\r\n\r\nSaid Lü Pu, “I am going to occupy Puyang and see what develops. How can\r\nyou guess?”\r\n\r\nSo he left the two captains in command at Yenchou and went away.\r\n\r\nNow when Tsʻao Tsʻao approached the dangerous part of the road near\r\nTʻaishan, Kuo Chia warned him to take care as there was doubtless an\r\nambush. But his master laughed, “We know all his dispositions. Do you\r\nthink he has laid an ambush? I shall tell Tsʻao Jên to besiege Yenchou\r\nand I shall go to Puyang.”\r\n\r\nWhen Chʻên Kung heard of the enemy’s approach he spoke, saying “The\r\nenemy will be fatigued with long marches so attack quickly before they\r\nhave time to recover.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu replied, “I, a single horseman, am afraid of none. I go and come\r\nas I will. Think you I fear this Tsʻao Tsʻao? Let him settle his camp;\r\nI will take him after that.”\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao Tsʻao neared Puyang and he made a camp. And soon after he led\r\nout his commanders and they arrayed their men in open and desert\r\ncountry. Tsʻao Tsʻao took up his station on horseback between the two\r\nstandards, watching while his opponents arrived and formed up in a\r\ncircular area. Lü Pu was in front, followed by eight of his captains,\r\nall strong men. Two were called Chang Liao and Tsang Pa; and there were\r\nsix others. They had five legions.\r\n\r\nThe drums began their thunderous roll and Tsʻao, pointing to his\r\nopponent, said, “You and I had no quarrel, why then did you invade my\r\nland?”\r\n\r\n“The Empire of Han is the possession of all; what is your special\r\nclaim?” said Lü.\r\n\r\nSo saying he ordered Tsang Pa to ride forth and challenge. From Tsʻao’s\r\nside the challenge was accepted by Yo Chin. The two steeds approached\r\neach other, two spears were lifted both together and they exchanged\r\nnear two score blows with no advantage to either. Then Hsiahou Tun rode\r\nout to help his colleague and, in reply, out went Chang Liao from Lü\r\nPu’s side. And they four fought.\r\n\r\nThen fierce anger seized upon Lü Pu. Setting his spear he urged his\r\nsteed forward to where the fight was waging. Seeing him approach\r\nHsiahou and Yo both fled, but Lü Pu pressed on after them and Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s army lost the day. Retiring a long way they made a new camp. Lü\r\nPu called in and mustered his men.\r\n\r\nThe day having gone against him Tsʻao Tsʻao called a council and Yü\r\nChin said, “From the hill tops to-day I saw a camp of our enemies on\r\nthe west of Puyang. They were but few men therein, and to-night after\r\nto-day’s victory, it will not be defended. Let us attack and if we can\r\ntake the camp we shall strike fear into the heart of Lü Pu. This is our\r\nbest plan.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao thought so too. He and six of his lieutenants and two legions\r\nleft that night by a secret road for the camp.\r\n\r\nIn Lü Pu’s camp was rejoicing for that day’s victory when Chʻên Kung\r\nreminded him of the west camp and its importance, and said that it\r\nmight be attacked, Lü Pu replied that the enemy would not dare approach\r\nafter that day’s defeat.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao is a very able commander,” replied Kung. “You must keep a\r\ngood lookout for him lest he attack our weak spot.”\r\n\r\nSo arrangements were made for defence. At dusk Tsʻao Tsʻao reached the\r\ncamp and began an immediate attack on all four sides. The defenders\r\ncould not hold him off. They ran in all directions and the camp was\r\ncaptured. Near the fourth watch, when the party told off to help defend\r\nthe camp reached it, Tsʻao Tsʻao sallied forth to meet them and met Kao\r\nShun. Another battle then began and waged till dawn. About that time a\r\nrolling of drums was heard in the west and they told Tsʻao that Lü Pu\r\nhimself was at hand. Thereupon Tsʻao Tsʻao abandoned the attack and\r\nfled.\r\n\r\nThey pursued him, Lü Pu taking the lead. Two of Tsʻao’s lieutenants\r\nattacked the pursuers but could not check them. Tsʻao went away north.\r\nBut from behind some hills came out more of Lü Pu’s army and as they\r\ncould not be beaten off Tsʻao sought safety in the west. Here again his\r\nretreat was barred.\r\n\r\nThe fight became desperate. Tsʻao Tsʻao dashed at the enemy’s array.\r\nThe din was terrible. Arrows fell like pelting rain upon them and they\r\ncould make no headway. He was desperate and cried out in fear, “Who can\r\nsave me?”\r\n\r\nThen from the crush dashed out Tien Wei with his double lance, crying\r\n“Fear not, my master.” He leapt from his steed, leaned his double lance\r\nagainst a wall and laid hold of a handful of darts. Turning to his\r\nfollowers he said, “When the ruffians are at ten paces, call out to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThen he set off with mighty strides, plunging forward careless of the\r\nflying arrows. Lü Pu’s horsemen followed and when they got near the\r\nfollowers shouted, “Ten paces!”\r\n\r\n“Five, then call!” shouted back Tien Wei, and went on.\r\n\r\nPresently, “Five paces!”\r\n\r\nThen Tien Wei spun round and flung the darts. With every fling a man\r\nfell from the saddle and never a dart missed.\r\n\r\nHaving thus slain half a score the remainder fled and Tien quickly\r\nremounted his steed, set his twin lance and rushed again into the fight\r\nwith a vigour that none could withstand. One by one his opponents\r\nyielded and he was able to lead Tsʻao Tsʻao safely out of the press of\r\nbattle. Tsʻao and his captains went to their camp.\r\n\r\nBut as evening fell the noise of pursuit fell on their ears and soon\r\nappeared Lü Pu himself. “Tsʻao, you rebel, do not flee!” shouted he as\r\nhe approached with his halberd ready for a thrust.\r\n\r\nAll stopped and looked in each others’ faces: the men were weary, their\r\nsteeds spent. Fear smote them and they looked around for some place of\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n        You may lead your lord safely out of the press,\r\n        But what if the enemy follow?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot say here what Tsʻao Tsʻao’s fate was, but the next chapter\r\nwill relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE PREFECT TʻAO THRICE OFFERS HIS CHARGE:\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO FIGHTS A GREAT BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter closed with Tsʻao Tsʻao in great danger. However, help\r\ncame. Hsiahou Tun with a small body of soldiers found his chief,\r\nchecked the pursuit, and fought with Lü Pu till dusk. Rain fell in\r\ntorrents swamping everything and as the daylight waned they drew off\r\nand Tsʻao Tsʻao reached camp. He rewarded Tien Wei richly and advanced\r\nhim in rank.\r\n\r\nWhen Lü Pu reached his camp he called in his adviser Chʻên Kung. The\r\nlatter proposed a new stratagem. He said, “In Puyang there is a rich\r\nfamily, Tʻien by name, who number thousands, enough to populate a whole\r\ndistrict in themselves. Make one of these people go to Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\ncamp with a pretended secret letter about Lü Pu’s ferocity, and the\r\nhatred of the people, and their desire to be rid of him. End by saying\r\nthat only Kao Shun is left to guard the city and they would help any\r\none who would come to save them. Thus our enemy will be inveigled into\r\nthe city and we will destroy him either by lire or ambush. His skill\r\nmay be equal to encompassing the universe but he will not escape.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu thought this trick might be tried and they arranged for the Tʻien\r\nfamily letter to be sent. Coming soon after the defeat, when Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao felt uncertain what step to take next, the secret letter was read\r\nwith joy. It promised help and said the sign should be a white flag\r\nwith the word “Rectitude” written thereon.\r\n\r\n“Heaven is going to give me Puyang,” said Tsʻao joyfully. So he\r\nrewarded the messenger very liberally and began to prepare for the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThen came Liu Hua saying, “Lü Pu is no strategist but Chʻên Kung is\r\nfull of guile; I fear treachery in this letter and you must be careful.\r\nIf you will go, then enter with only one third your army leaving the\r\nothers outside the city as a reserve.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao agreed to take this precaution. He went to Puyang, which he found\r\ngay with fluttering flags. Looking carefully he saw among them, at the\r\nwest gate, the white flag with the looked-for inscription. His heart\r\nrejoiced.\r\n\r\nThat day, just about noon, the city gates opened and two bodies of\r\nsoldiers appeared as if to fight. Tsʻao Tsʻao told off two of his\r\ncaptains to oppose them. Neither body, however, came on to engage but\r\nfell back into the city. By this move the assailants had been drawn\r\nclose up to the drawbridge. From within the city several soldiers were\r\nseen taking any chance of confusion to escape and come outside. To\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao they said they were clients of the Tʻien family and they\r\ngave him secret letters stating the signal would be given about watch\r\nsetting by beating a gong. That would be the time to attack. The gates\r\nwould be opened.\r\n\r\nSo the rescuers were stationed and four trusty captains told off to\r\naccompany Tsʻao Tsʻao into the city. One of these, Li Tien, pressed\r\nupon his master the precaution of letting him go first. But Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nbade him be silent. “If I do not go, who will advance?” And so at the\r\ntime appointed he led the way. The moon had not yet arisen.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near the west gate they heard a crackling sound, then a loud\r\nshouting, and then torches moved hither and thither. Next the gates\r\nwere thrown wide open and Tsʻao Tsʻao, whipping up his steed, galloped\r\nin.\r\n\r\nBut when he reached the residence he noticed the streets were quite\r\ndeserted and then he knew he had been tricked. Wheeling round his horse\r\nhe shouted to his followers to retire. This was the signal for another\r\nmove. An explosion of a signal-bomb was heard close at hand and it was\r\nechoed from every side in a deafening roar. Gongs and drums beat all\r\naround with a roar like rivers rushing backward to their source and the\r\nocean boiling up from its depths. From two sides came bodies of\r\nsoldiers eager to attack.\r\n\r\nTsʻao dashed off toward the north only to find his way barred; he tried\r\nfor the south gate, but met enemies led by Kao Shun and Hou Chʻêng. His\r\ntrusty henchman Tien Wei, with fierce eyes and gritting teeth, at last\r\nburst through and got out, with the enemy close after him.\r\n\r\nBut when he reached the drawbridge he glanced behind him and missed his\r\nmaster. Immediately he turned back and cut his way inside. Just within\r\nhe met Li Tien.\r\n\r\n“Where is our lord?” cried he.\r\n\r\n“I am looking for him.”\r\n\r\n“Quick! get help from outside,” shouted Tien Wei. “I will seek him.”\r\n\r\nSo one hastened for aid and the other slashed his way in, looking on\r\nevery side for Tsʻao Tsʻao. He was not to be found. Dashing out of the\r\ncity Tien Wei ran up against Yo Chin, who asked where their lord was.\r\n\r\n“I have entered the city twice in search of him, but cannot find him,”\r\nsaid Tien.\r\n\r\n“Let us go in together,” said Yo Chin.\r\n\r\nThey rode up to the gate. But the noise of bombs from the gate tower\r\nfrightened Yo Chin’s horse, so that it refused to pass. Wherefore Tien\r\nWei alone went in, butting through the smoke and dashing through the\r\nflames. But he got in and searched on every side.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao saw his sturdy protector cut his way out and disappear\r\nleaving him surrounded, he again made an attempt to reach the north\r\ngate. On the way, sharply outlined against the glow, he saw the figure\r\nof Lü Pu coming toward him with his halberd ready to kill. Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\ncovered his face with his hand, whipped up his steed and galloped past.\r\nBut Lü Pu came galloping up behind him and tapping him on the helmet\r\nwith the halberd cried, “Where is Tsʻao Tsʻao?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao turned and, pointing to a dun horse well ahead, cried, “There; on\r\nthat dun! that’s he.”\r\n\r\nHearing this Lü Pu left pursuing Tsʻao Tsʻao to gallop after the rider\r\nof the dun.\r\n\r\nThus relieved Tsʻao Tsʻao set off for the east gate. Then he fell in\r\nwith Tien Wei, who took him under his protection and fought through the\r\npress leaving a trail of death behind till they reached the gate. Here\r\nthe fire was raging fiercely and burning beams were falling on all\r\nsides. The earth element seemed to have interchanged with the fire\r\nelement. Tien Wei warded off the burning pieces of wood with his lance\r\nand rode into the smoke making a way for his lord. Just as they were\r\npassing through the gate a flaming beam fell from the gate tower. Tsʻao\r\njust warded it off with his arm but it struck his steed on the quarters\r\nand knocked him down. Tsʻao’s hand and arm were badly burned and his\r\nhair and beard singed.\r\n\r\nTien Wei turned back to his rescue. Luckily Hsiahou Yüan came along\r\njust then and the two raised Tsʻao and set him on Yüan’s horse. And\r\nthus they got him out of the burning city. But the fighting went on\r\ntill daybreak.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao returned to his camp. His officers crowded about his tent,\r\nanxious for news of his health. He soon recovered and laughed when he\r\nthought of his escape.\r\n\r\n“I blundered into that fool’s trap, but I will have my revenge,” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n“Let us have a new plan soon,” said Kuo Chia.\r\n\r\n“I will turn his trick to my own use. I will spread the false report\r\nthat I was burned in the fire and that I died at the fifth watch. He\r\nwill come to attack as soon as the news gets abroad and I will have an\r\nambush ready for him in Maling Hills. I will get him this time.”\r\n\r\n“Really a fine stratagem!” said Kuo.\r\n\r\nSo the soldiers were put into mourning and the report went everywhere\r\nthat Tsʻao Tsʻao was dead. And soon Lü Pu heard it and he assembled his\r\nmen at once to make a surprise attack, taking the road by the Maling\r\nHills to his enemy’s camp.\r\n\r\nAs he was passing the hills he heard the drums beating for an advance\r\nand the ambushed soldiers leapt out all round him. Only by desperate\r\nfighting did he get out of the mêlée and with a sadly diminished force\r\nreturned to his camp at Puyang. There he strengthened the\r\nfortifications and could not be tempted forth to battle.\r\n\r\nThis year locusts suddenly appeared and they consumed every green\r\nblade. There was a famine and in the east grain rose to fifty “strings”\r\na hu (bushel). People even took to cannibalism. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army\r\nsuffered from want and he marched them to Chuangchʻêng. Lü Pu took his\r\nmen to Shanyang. Perforce therefore the fighting ceased.\r\n\r\nIt is time to return to Hsüchou. Tʻao Chʻien, over sixty years of age,\r\nsuddenly fell seriously ill and he summoned his confident, Mi Chu, to\r\nhis chamber to make arrangements for the future. As to the situation\r\nthe adviser said, “Tsʻao Tsʻao abandoned his attack on this place\r\nbecause of his enemy’s seizure of Yenchou and now they are both keeping\r\nthe peace solely because of the famine. But Tsʻao will surely renew the\r\nattack in the spring. When Liu Yüan-tê refused to allow you to vacate\r\noffice in his favour you were in full vigour. Now you are ill and weak\r\nand you can make this a reason for retirement. He will not refuse\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nSo a message was sent to the little garrison town calling Liu Pei to a\r\ncounsel on military affairs. This brought him with his brothers and a\r\nslender escort. He was at once called in to the sick man’s chamber.\r\nQuickly disposing of the enquiries about his health Tʻao soon came to\r\nthe real object of his call for Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I asked you to come for the sole reason that I am dangerously ill\r\nand like to die at any time. I look to you, illustrious Sir, to\r\nconsider the Hans and their Empire as more important than anything\r\nelse, and so to take over the symbols of office of this district, the\r\ncommission and the seal, that I may close my eyes in peace.”\r\n\r\n“You have two sons, why not depute them to relieve you?” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Both lack the requisite talents. I trust you will instruct them after\r\nI have gone, but do not let them have the guidance of affairs.”\r\n\r\n“But I am unequal to so great a charge.”\r\n\r\n“I will recommend to you one who could assist you. He is Sun Chʻien who\r\ncould be appointed to some post.”\r\n\r\nTurning to Mi Chu he said, “The noble Liu here is the most prominent\r\nman of the time and you should serve him well.”\r\n\r\nStill would Liu Pei have put from him such a post, but just then the\r\nPrefect, pointing to his heart to indicate his sincerity, passed away.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremonial wailings of the officials were over, the insignia\r\nof office were brought to Liu Pei. But he would have none of them. The\r\nfollowing days the inhabitants of the town and country around crowded\r\ninto the residence bowing and with tears calling upon Liu to receive\r\nthe charge. “If you do not we cannot live in peace,” said they. To\r\nthese requests his brothers added their persuasion, till at length he\r\nconsented to assume the administrative duties. He forthwith appointed\r\nSun and Mi as his official advisers and Chʻên Têng his secretary. His\r\nguard came up from Hsiaopʻei and he put forth proclamations to reassure\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nHe also attended to the burial ceremonies, he and all his army dressing\r\nin mourning. After the fullest sacrifices and ceremonies a burial place\r\nfor the late Prefect was found close to the source of the Yellow River.\r\nThe dead man’s testament was forwarded to Court.\r\n\r\nThe news of the events in Hsüchou duly reached the ears of Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nthen in Chüanchʻêng. Said he, angrily, “I have missed my revenge. This\r\nLiu has simply stepped into command of the district without expending\r\nhalf an arrow; he sat still and attained his desire. But I will put him\r\nto death and then dig up Tʻao’s corpse in revenge for the death of my\r\nnoble father.”\r\n\r\nOrders were issued for the army to prepare for a new campaign against\r\nHsüchou. But an adviser, Hsün Yü, remonstrated with Tsʻao saying, “When\r\nthe founder of the Han dynasty secured Kuanchung and his illustrious\r\nsuccessor on the throne, Kuang-wu, took Honei, they both first\r\nconsolidated their position whereby they could command the whole\r\nEmpire. Their whole progress was from success to success. Hence they\r\naccomplished their great designs in spite of difficulties. Illustrious\r\nSir, your Kuanchung and your Honei are Yenchow, which you had first,\r\nand Hochi which is of the utmost strategic value. If you undertake this\r\nexpedition against Hsüchou leaving many men here, you will not\r\naccomplish your design; if you leave too few, Lü Pu will fall upon us.\r\nAnd finally if you lose this and fail to gain Hsüchou whither will you\r\nretire? That prefecture is not vacant. Although Tʻao has gone, Liu Pei\r\nholds it, and since the people support him they will fight to the death\r\nfor him. To abandon this place for that is to exchange the great for\r\nthe small, to barter the trunk for the branches, to leave safety and\r\nrun into danger. I would implore you to reflect well.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao replied, “It is not a good plan to keep soldiers idle here\r\nduring such scarcity.”\r\n\r\n“If that is so it would be more advantageous to attack the east and\r\nfeed your army on their supplies. Some remnant of the Yellow Turbans\r\nare there with stores and treasures of all kinds that they have amassed\r\nby plundering wherever they could. Rebels of their stamp are easily\r\nbroken. Break them, and you can feed your army with their grain.\r\nMoreover, both the Court and the common people will join in blessing\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThis new design appealed strongly to Tsʻao Tsʻao and he quickly began\r\nhis preparations to carry it out. He left Hsiahou Tun and Tsʻao Jên to\r\nguard Chüanchʻêng while his main body, under his own command, marched\r\nto seize Chʻênchʻêng. This done they went to Juying.\r\n\r\nNow when the Yellow Turbans knew that Tsʻao Tsʻao was approaching they\r\ncame out in a great body to oppose him. They met at Goat Hill. Though\r\nthe rebels were numerous, they were a poor lot, a mere pack of foxes\r\nand dogs without organisation and lacking discipline. Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nordered his strong archers and vigorous crossbowmen to keep them in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nTien Wei was sent out to challenge. The rebel leader chose a\r\nsecond-rate champion for his side, who rode out and was vanquished in\r\nthe third bout. Then Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army pushed forward and they made a\r\ncamp at Goat Hill.\r\n\r\nThe following day the rebel Huang Shao himself led forth his army and\r\nmade his battle array along a circle. A leader advanced on foot to\r\noffer combat. He wore a yellow turban on his head and a green robe. His\r\nweapon was an iron mace. He shouted, “I am Ho Man the Yakcha who shoots\r\nacross the sky; who dare fight with me?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Hung uttered a great shout and jumped from the saddle to accept\r\nthe challenge. Sword in hand he advanced on foot and the two engaged in\r\nfierce combat in the face of both armies. They exchanged some scores of\r\nblows, neither gaining the advantage. Then Tsʻao Hung feigned defeat\r\nand ran away. Ho Man went after him. Just as he closed Hung tried a\r\nfeint and then suddenly wheeling about, wounded his adversary. Another\r\nslash, and Ho Man lay dead.\r\n\r\nAt once Li Tien dashed forward into the midst of the enemy and laid\r\nhands on the rebel chief whom he carried off captive. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s men\r\nthen set on and scattered the rebels. The spoil of treasure and food\r\nwas immense.\r\n\r\nThe other leader, Ho I, fled with a few horsemen toward Kopei.\r\n\r\nWhile on their road thither there suddenly appeared a force led by a\r\ncertain swashbuckler, who shall be nameless for the moment. This bravo\r\nwas a shortish man, thickset and stout, with a waist ten span in girth.\r\nHe used a long sword.\r\n\r\nHe barred the way of retreat. The rebel leader set his spear and rode\r\ntoward him. But at the first encounter the bravo caught him under his\r\narm and bore him off a prisoner. All his men were terror-stricken,\r\ndropped from their horses and allowed themselves to be bound. Then the\r\nvictor drove them like cattle into an enclosure with high banks.\r\n\r\nPresently Tien Wei, still pursuing the rebels, reached Kopei. The\r\nswashbuckler went out to meet him.\r\n\r\n“Are you also a Yellow Turban?” said Tien Wei.\r\n\r\n“I have some hundreds of them prisoners in an enclosure here.”\r\n\r\n“Why not bring them out?” said Tien.\r\n\r\n“I will if you win this sword from my hand.”\r\n\r\nThis annoyed Tien Wei who attacked him. They engaged and the combat\r\nlasted for two long hours and then was still undecided. Both rested a\r\nwhile. The swashbuckler was the first to recover and renewed the\r\nchallenge. They fought till dusk and then, as their horses were quite\r\nspent, the combat was once more suspended.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime some of Tien Wei’s men had run off to tell the story of\r\nthis wondrous fight to Tsʻao Tsʻao who hastened in amazement, followed\r\nby many officers to watch it and see the result.\r\n\r\nNext day the unknown warrior rode out again and Tsʻao Tsʻao saw him. In\r\nhis heart he rejoiced to see such a doughty hero and desired to gain\r\nhis services for his own side. So he bade his champion feign defeat.\r\n\r\nTien Wei rode out in answer to the challenge and some score of bouts\r\nwere fought. Then Tien Wei turned and fled toward his own side. The\r\nbravo followed and came quite close. But a flight of arrows drove him\r\naway.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao hastily drew off his men for some distance and then\r\nsecretly sent a certain number to dig a pitfall and sent hookmen to lie\r\nin ambush.\r\n\r\nThe following day Tien Wei was sent out with a small company of horse.\r\nHis adversary nothing loth came to meet him.\r\n\r\n“Why does the defeated leader venture forth again?” cried he laughing.\r\n\r\nThe swashbuckler spurred forward to join battle but Tien Wei, after a\r\nfaint show of fighting, turned his horse and rode away. His adversary\r\nintent upon capture, took no care and he and his followers all\r\nblundered into the pitfall. The hookmen took them all captive, bound\r\nthem and carried them before their chief.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw the prisoners, Tsʻao advanced from his tent, sent\r\naway the soldiers and with his own hands loosened the leader’s bonds.\r\nThen he brought out clothing and dressed him, bade him be seated and\r\nasked who he was and whence he came.\r\n\r\n“I am named Hsü Chʻu, and by my near friends called Chungkʻang. I am\r\nfrom Chao. [4] When the rebellion broke out I and my relations built a\r\nstronghold within a rampart for protection. One day the robbers came\r\nbut I had stones ready for them. I told my relatives to keep on\r\nbringing them up to me and I threw them, hitting somebody every time I\r\nthrew. This drove off the robbers.”\r\n\r\n“Another day they came and we were short of grain. So I agreed with\r\nthem to an exchange of plough oxen against grain. They delivered the\r\ngrain and were driving away the oxen when the beasts took fright and\r\ntore off to their pens. I seized two of them by the tail, one with each\r\nhand, and hauled them backwards a hundred or so paces. The robbers were\r\nso amazed that they thought no more about oxen but went their way. So\r\nthey never troubled us again.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of your mighty exploits,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. “Will you\r\njoin my army?”\r\n\r\n“That is my strongest desire,” said Hsü.\r\n\r\nSo he called up his clan, some hundreds in all, and they formally\r\nsubmitted to Tsʻao Tsʻao. The strong man received the rank of Tu-yü and\r\nreceived ample rewards. The two rebel leaders were executed.\r\n\r\nJuying being now perfectly quiet Tsʻao Tsʻao withdrew his army. His\r\nlieutenants came out to welcome him and they told him that spies had\r\nreported Yenchou to be left defenceless, all its garrison having given\r\nthemselves up to plundering the surrounding country, and they wanted\r\nhim to go against it without loss of time. “With these soldiers fresh\r\nfrom victory the city will fall at a tap of the drum,” said they.\r\n\r\nSo the army was marched to the city. An attack was quite unexpected but\r\nthe two leaders, Hsüeh and Li, hurried out their few soldiers to fight.\r\nHsü Chʻu, the latest recruit, said he wished to capture these two and\r\nhe would make of them an introductory gift.\r\n\r\nThe task was given him and he rode forth. Li Fêng with his halberd\r\nadvanced to meet Hsü Chʻu. The combat was brief as Li fell in the\r\nsecond bout. His colleague retired with his men. He found the\r\ndrawbridge had been seized so that he could not get shelter within the\r\ncity. He led his men toward Chüyeh. He was followed and slain. His\r\nsoldiers scattered to the four winds. And thus Yenchou was recaptured.\r\n\r\nNext an expedition was prepared to take Puyang. The army moved out in\r\nperfect order with van leaders, commanders of the flanks and rear\r\nguard. Tsʻao Tsʻao led the centre; Tien Wei and Hsü Chʻu were van\r\nleaders. When they approached Puyang, Lü Pu wished to go out in person\r\nand alone to attack but his adviser protested, begging him to await the\r\narrival of his officers.\r\n\r\n“Whom do I fear?” said Lü.\r\n\r\nSo he threw caution to the winds and went. He met his foes and he began\r\nto revile them. The redoubtable Hsü Chʻu went to fight with him, but\r\nafter a score of bouts neither combatant was any the worse.\r\n\r\n“He is not the sort that one man can overcome,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao, and\r\nhe sent Tien Wei to assist. Lü Pu stood the double onslaught. Soon\r\nafter the flank commanders joined in and Lü Pu had six opponents. These\r\nproved really too many for him so he turned his horse and rode back to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nBut when the members of the Tʻien family saw him coming back beaten\r\nthey raised the drawbridge. Pu shouted to open the gates, but the\r\nTʻiens said, “We have gone over to Tsʻao Tsʻao.” This was hard to hear\r\nand the beaten man abused them roundly before he left. The faithful\r\nChʻên Kung got away through the east gate taking with him the general’s\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThus Puyang came into Tsʻao Tsʻao’s hands and for their present\r\nservices the Tʻien family were pardoned their previous fault. However,\r\nLiu Hua said that savage Lü Pu left alive was a great danger and he\r\nshould be hunted down. Wherefore Tsʻao Tsʻao determined to follow Lü Pu\r\nto Tingtʻao whither he had gone for refuge.\r\n\r\nLü Pu and many of his captains were assembled in the city, but certain\r\nof them were out foraging. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army arrived but did not\r\nattack for many days and presently he withdrew a long way and made a\r\nstockade. It was the time of harvest and he set his men to cut the\r\nwheat for food. The spies having reported this to Lü Pu he came over to\r\nsee, but when he saw that Tsʻao Tsʻao’s stockade lay near a thick wood\r\nhe feared an ambush and retired. Tsʻao Tsʻao heard that he had come and\r\ngone and guessed the reason.\r\n\r\n“He fears an ambush in the wood,” said he. “We will set up flags there\r\nand deceive him. There is a long embankment near the camp but behind it\r\nthere is no water. There we will lay an ambush to fall upon Lü Pu when\r\nhe comes to burn the wood.”\r\n\r\nSo he hid all his soldiers behind the embankment except half a hundred\r\ndrummers, and he got together many peasants to loiter within the\r\nstockade as though it was empty.\r\n\r\nLü Pu rode back and told his adviser what he had seen. “This Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao is very crafty and full of wiles,” said the adviser; “great care\r\nis necessary.”\r\n\r\n“I will use fire this time and burn out his ambush,” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nNext morning he rode out and there he saw flags flying everywhere in\r\nthe wood. He ordered his men forward to set fire on all sides. But to\r\nhis surprise no one rushed out to make for the stockade. Still he heard\r\nthe beating of drums and doubt filled his mind. Suddenly he saw a party\r\nof soldiers move out from the shelter of the stockade. He galloped over\r\nto see what it meant.\r\n\r\nThen the signal-bombs exploded; out rushed the men and all their\r\nleaders dashed forward. Lü Pu was at a loss and fled into the open\r\ncountry. One of his captains was killed by an arrow. Two thirds of his\r\nmen were lost and the beaten remainder went to tell Chʻên Kung what had\r\ncome to pass.\r\n\r\n“We had better leave” said he. “An empty city cannot be held.”\r\n\r\nSo he and Kao Shun, taking their chief’s family with them, abandoned\r\nTingtʻao. When Tsʻao Tsʻao’s soldiers got into the city they met with\r\nno resistance, one leader burned himself to death, the other fled to\r\nYüan Shu.\r\n\r\nThus the whole of Shantung fell under the power of Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHow he tranquillised the people and rebuilt the cities will not be told\r\nhere. But Lü Pu in his retreat fell in with his foragers and Chʻên Kung\r\nalso rejoined him so that he was by no means broken.\r\n\r\n“I have but few men,” said he, “but still enough to break Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\nAnd so he retook the backward road.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Thus does fortune alternate, victory, defeat,\r\n        The happy conqueror to-day, to-morrow, must retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the fate of Lü Pu will appear later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGREAT BATTLE BETWEEN LI TSʻUI AND KUO SSŬ:\r\nTHE EMPEROR RESCUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter told of the defeat of Lü Pu, and his gathering the\r\nremnant of his army at Haipin. When all his lieutenants had joined him\r\nhe began to feel strong enough to try conclusions with Tsʻao Tsʻao once\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSaid Chʻên Kung, who was opposed to this course, “He is too strong;\r\nseek some place where you can rest a time before trying.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I went to Yüan Shao,” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“Send first to make enquiries.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu agreed. The news of the fighting between Tsʻao and Lü Pu had\r\nreached Ichou and one of Yüan’s advisers, Shên Pʻei, warned him saying,\r\n“If this savage Lü Pu gets possession of Yenchou he will certainly\r\nattempt to add this district to it. For your own safety you should help\r\nto crush him.”\r\n\r\nWherefore Yen Liang, with five legions, was sent. The spies heard this\r\nand at once told Lü Pu, who was greatly disturbed and called in the\r\nfaithful Chʻên Kung.\r\n\r\n“Go over to Liu Pei, who has lately succeeded to Hsüchou.”\r\n\r\nHence Lü Pu went thither. Some one urged Liu Pei to go out to meet such\r\na warrior and receive him with honour. Mi Chu was strongly against\r\nreceiving him at all saying he was a cruel, bloodthirsty beast.\r\n\r\nBut Pei replied, “How would misfortune have been averted from this\r\nplace if he had not attacked Yenchou? He cannot be our enemy now that\r\nhe comes seeking an asylum.”\r\n\r\n“Brother, your heart is really too good. Although it may be as you say\r\nyet it would be well to prepare,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\nThe new Prefect with a great following met Lü a long way outside the\r\ncity gates and the two chiefs rode in side by side. They proceeded to\r\nthe residence and there, after the elaborate ceremonies of reception\r\nwere over, they sat down to converse.\r\n\r\n“After Wang Yün’s plot to slay Tung Cho and my misfortune in the Li-Kuo\r\nsedition, I drifted about from one place to another and none of the\r\nnobles seemed willing to receive me. When Tsʻao Tsʻao wickedly invaded\r\nthis district and you, Sir, came to its rescue, I aided you by\r\nattacking Yenchou and thus diverting a portion of his force. I did not\r\nthink then that I should be the victim of a vile plot and lose my\r\nleaders and my soldiers. But now if you will I offer myself to you that\r\nwe may together accomplish great designs.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “When the late Prefect died there was no one to\r\nadminister Hsüchou and so I assumed that task for a time. Now since you\r\nare here, General, it is most suitable that I retire in your favour.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he handed the insignia and the seal to Lü Pu. Lü was on the\r\npoint of accepting them when he saw Kuan and Chang, who stood behind\r\nthe Prefect, glaring at him with angry eyes, so he put on a smile and\r\nsaid, “Lü may be something of a fighting man but he could not rule a\r\nplace like this.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê repeated his offer. Chʻên Kung said, “The strong guest does not\r\noppress his host. You need not fear, O Prince Elect.”\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê desisted. Banquets were held and dwelling places prepared\r\nfor the guest and his retinue. As soon as convenient Lü Pu returned the\r\nfeast. Liu Pei went with his two brothers. Half through the banquet Lü\r\nPu requested his guest to retire to one of the inner private rooms,\r\nwhither the brothers followed him. There Lü Pu bade his wife and\r\ndaughters bow as to their benefactor. Here also Yüan-tê showed\r\nexcessive modesty and Pu said, “Good younger brother, you need not be\r\nso very modest.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei heard what he said and his eyes glared. “What sort of a man\r\nare you that dares call our brother, ‘younger brother’?” cried he. “He\r\nis one of the ruling family (a golden branch, a jade leaf). Come out;\r\nand I will fight you three hundred bouts for the insult.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê hastily checked the impulsive one and Kuan Yü persuaded him to\r\ngo away. Then the host apologised saying, “My poor brother talks wildly\r\nafter he has been drinking. I hope you will not blame him.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu nodded, but said nothing. Soon after the guests departed. But as\r\nthe host escorted Liu Pei to his carriage he saw Chang Fei galloping up\r\narmed as for a fray.\r\n\r\n“Lü Pu, you and I will fight that duel of three hundred!” shouted he.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei bade Kuan Yü check him. Next day Lü Pu came to take leave of\r\nhis host. “You, O Prince, kindly received me but I fear your brothers\r\nand I cannot agree. So I will seek some other asylum.”\r\n\r\n“General, if you go, my brother’s fault becomes grave. My rude brother\r\nhas offended and must eventually apologise. In the meantime what think\r\nyou of a temporary sojourn at the town where I was encamped for some\r\ntime, Hsiaopʻei? The place is small and mean, but it is near and I will\r\nsee to it that you are supplied with all you need.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu thanked him and accepted this offer. He led his men there and\r\ntook up residence. After he had gone Liu Pei buried his annoyance and\r\nChang Fei did not again refer to the matter.\r\n\r\nThat Tsʻao Tsʻao had subdued Shantung has been stated before. He\r\nmemorialised the throne and was rewarded with the title of General with\r\nthe epithet “Firm Virtue” and a marquisate. At this time the rebellious\r\nLi Tsʻui had made himself Ta-ssŭ-ma, or Minister of War, and his\r\ncolleague styled himself Grand Commander. Their conduct was abominable\r\nbut no one dared to criticise them. The Tai-yü Yang Piao and the\r\nMinister of Agriculture, Chu Chien, privately talked with the Emperor\r\nHsien and said, “Tsʻao Tsʻao has twenty legions of soldiers and many\r\ncapable advisers and leaders; it would be well for the Empire if he\r\nwould lend his support to the imperial family and help to rid the\r\ngovernment of this evil party.”\r\n\r\nHis Majesty wept, “I am weary of the insults and contempt of these\r\nwretches and should be very glad to have them removed,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I have thought of a plan to estrange Li and Kuo and so make them\r\ndestroy each other. Then Tsʻao could come and cleanse the Court,” said\r\nPiao.\r\n\r\n“How will you manage it?” asked the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“Kuo’s wife is very jealous and we can take advantage of her weakness\r\nto bring about a quarrel.”\r\n\r\nSo Yang Piao received instruction to act, with a secret edict to\r\nsupport him.\r\n\r\nPiao’s wife made an excuse to visit Madam Kuo at her palace and, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, said “There is talk of secret liaison between\r\nthe General, your husband, and the wife of the Minister Li. It is a\r\ngreat secret, but if the Minister knew it he might try to harm your\r\nhusband. I think you ought to have very little to do with that family.”\r\n\r\nMadam Kuo was surprised but said, “I have wondered why he has been\r\nsleeping away from home lately, but I did not think there was anything\r\nshameful connected with it. I should never have known if you had not\r\nspoken. I must put a stop to it.”\r\n\r\nBy and by, when Madam Yang took her leave, her hostess thanked her\r\nwarmly for the information she had given.\r\n\r\nSome days passed and Kuo Ssŭ was going over to the dwelling of his\r\ncolleague to a dinner. His wife did not wish him to go and she said,\r\n“This Tsʻui is very deep and one cannot fathom his designs. You two are\r\nnot of equal rank and if he made away with you, what would become of\r\nyour poor handmaid?”\r\n\r\nKuo Ssŭ paid no attention and his wife could not prevail on him to stay\r\nat home. Late in the afternoon some presents arrived from the Li palace\r\nand Kuo’s wife secretly put poison into the delicacies before she set\r\nthem before her lord. He was going to taste at once but she said, “It\r\nis unwise to consume things that come from outside. Let us try on a dog\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\nThey did and the dog died. This incident made Kuo doubt the kindly\r\nintentions of his colleague.\r\n\r\nOne day, at the close of business at Court, Li invited Kuo to his\r\npalace. After Kuo arrived home in the evening, rather the worse for too\r\nmuch wine, he was seized with a colic. His wife said she suspected\r\npoison and hastily administered an emetic, which relieved the pain. Kuo\r\nSsŭ began to feel angry.\r\n\r\n“We did everything together and helped each other always. Now he wants\r\nto injure me. If I do not get in the first blow, I shall suffer some\r\ninjury.”\r\n\r\nSo Kuo began to prepare his guard for any sudden emergency. This was\r\ntold to Li and he in turn grew angry, saying, “So Kuo is doing so and\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nThen he got his guard under way and came to attack Kuo. Both houses had\r\nseveral legions and the quarrel became so serious that they fought a\r\npitched battle under the city walls. When that was over both sides\r\nturned to plunder the people.\r\n\r\nThen a nephew of Li’s suddenly surrounded the palace, put the Emperor\r\nand Empress Dowager Fu in two carriages and carried them off. The\r\npalace attendants were made to follow on foot. As they went out of the\r\nrear gate they met Kuo’s army who began to shoot at the cavalcade with\r\narrows. They killed many attendants before Li’s army came up and forced\r\nthem to retire.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say how the carriages were got out of the palace\r\nbut they eventually reached Li’s camp, while Kuo’s men plundered the\r\npalace and carried off all the women left there to their camp. Then the\r\npalace was set on fire.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Kuo Ssŭ heard of the whereabouts of the Emperor he came over\r\nto attack the camp. The Emperor between these two opposing factions was\r\ngreatly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Slowly the Hans had declined but renewed their vigour with\r\n                                                              Kuang-Wu,\r\n    Twelve were the rulers before him, followed him also twelve others.\r\n    Foolish were two of the latest, dangers surrounded the altars,\r\n    These were degenerate days, with authority given to eunuchs.\r\n    Then did Ho Chin the simple, the inept, who commanded the army,\r\n    Warriors call to the capital, wishing to drive out the vermin;\r\n    Though they drove out the leopard, tigers and wolves quickly\r\n                                                               entered,\r\n    All kinds of evil were wrought by a low class creature from\r\n                                                               Hsichou.\r\n    Wang Yün, honest of heart, beguiled this wretch with a woman,\r\n    Much desired of his henchman, thus sowing seeds of dissension.\r\n    Strife resulted, and peace no longer dwelt in the Empire.\r\n    No one suspected that Li and Kuo would continue the evil,\r\n    Much to the sorrow of China; yet they strove for a trifle.\r\n    Famine stalked in the palace, grief for the clashing of weapons;\r\n    Why did the warriors strive? Why was the land thus partitioned?\r\n    We had turned aside from the way appointed of Heaven.\r\n    Kings must ponder these things; heavy the burden lies on them,\r\n    Chiefest in all the realm theirs is no common appointment,\r\n    Should the King falter or fail, calamities fall on the people,\r\n    The Empire is drenched with their blood, grisly ruin surrounds\r\n                                                                  them.\r\n    Steeped in sorrow and sad, read I the ancient records,\r\n    Long is the tale of years; the tale of sorrow is longer.\r\n    Wherefore he who would rule, chiefly must exercise forethought.\r\n    This and his keen-edged blade, these must suffice to maintain him.\r\n\r\n\r\nKuo Ssŭ’s army arrived and Li Tsʻui went out to give battle. Kuo’s men\r\nhad no success and retired. Then Li Tsʻui removed the imperial captives\r\nto Meiwu with his nephew as gaoler. Supplies were reduced and famine\r\nshowed itself on the faces of the eunuchs. The Emperor sent to Li to\r\nrequest five measures of rice and five sets of bullock bones for his\r\nattendants. Li angrily replied, “The Court gets food morning and\r\nevening; why do they ask for more?”\r\n\r\nHe sent putrid meat and rotten grain and the Emperor was very vexed at\r\nthe new insult.\r\n\r\nYang Piao counselled patience. “He is a base creature but, under the\r\npresent circumstances, Your Majesty must put up with it. You may not\r\nprovoke him.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor bowed and was silent, but the tears fell on his garments.\r\nSuddenly some one came in with the tidings that a force of cavalry,\r\ntheir sabres glittering in the sun, was approaching to rescue them.\r\nThen they heard the gongs beat and the roll of the drums.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor sent to find out who it was. But it was Kuo Ssŭ, and the\r\nsadness fell again. Presently arose a great din. For Li had gone out to\r\ndo battle with Kuo, whom he abused by name.\r\n\r\n“I treated you well and why did you try to kill me?” said Li.\r\n\r\n“You are a rebel, why should I not slay you?” cried Kuo.\r\n\r\n“You call me rebel when I am guarding the Emperor?”\r\n\r\n“You have abducted him; do you call that guarding?”\r\n\r\n“Why so many words? Let us forgo a battle and settle the matter in\r\nsingle combat, the winner to take the Emperor and go.”\r\n\r\nThey two fought in front of their armies but neither could prevail over\r\nthe other. Then they saw Yang Piao come riding up to them, crying,\r\n“Rest a while, O Commanders! for I have invited a party of officers to\r\narrange a peace.”\r\n\r\nWherefore the two leaders retired to their camps. Soon Yang Piao, Sun\r\nChʻien and three score other officials came up and went to Kuo’s camp.\r\nThey were all thrown into confinement.\r\n\r\n“We came with good intentions,” they moaned, “and we are treated like\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“Li Tsʻui has run off with the Emperor but I have got his officers,”\r\nsaid Kuo.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean? One has the Emperor, the other his officers. What\r\ndo you want?” said the peace-maker, Yang Piao.\r\n\r\nKuo lost patience and drew his sword, but a certain Yang Mi persuaded\r\nhim not to slay the speaker. Then he released Yang Piao and Sun Chʻien;\r\nbut kept the others in the camp, “Here are we two officers of the\r\nthrone and we cannot help our lord. We have been born in vain,” said\r\nYang Piao.\r\n\r\nThrowing their arms about each other they wept and fell swooning to the\r\nearth. Sun Chʻien went home, fell seriously ill and died.\r\n\r\nThereafter the two adversaries fought every day for nearly three months\r\neach losing many men.\r\n\r\nNow Li Tsʻui was irreligious and practised magic. He often called\r\nwitches to beat drums and summon spirits, even when in camp. Chia Hsü\r\nused to remonstrate with him, but quite uselessly.\r\n\r\nA certain Yang Chi said to the Emperor, “That Chia Hsü, although a\r\nfriend of Li’s, never seems to have lost the sense of loyalty to Your\r\nMajesty.”\r\n\r\nSoon after Chia Hsü himself arrived. The Emperor sent away his\r\nattendants and said to him weeping the while, “Can you not pity the\r\nHans and help me?”\r\n\r\nChia prostrated himself, saying, “That is my dearest wish. But, Sire,\r\nsay no more, let they servant work out a plan.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor dried his tears and soon Li Tsʻui came in. He wore a sword\r\nby his side and strode straight up to the Emperor, whose face became\r\nthe colour of clay. Then he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Kuo Ssŭ has failed in his duty and imprisoned the court officers. He\r\nwished to slay Your Majesty and you would have been captured but for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor joined his hands together in salute and thanked him. He\r\nwent away. Before long Huangfu Li entered and the Emperor, knowing him\r\nas a man of persuasive tongue and that he came from the same district\r\nas Li, bade him go to both factions to try to arrange peace. He\r\naccepted the mission and first went to Kuo, who said he was willing to\r\nrelease the officers if Li Tsʻui would restore the Emperor to full\r\nliberty. He then went to the other side.\r\n\r\nTo Li he said, “Since I am a Hsiliang man the Emperor and the officers\r\nhave selected me to make peace between you and your adversary. He has\r\nconsented to cease the quarrel; will you agree to peace?”\r\n\r\n“I overthrew Lü Pu; I have upheld the government for four years and\r\nhave many great services to my credit as all the world knows. That\r\nother fellow, that horse-thief, has dared to seize the officers of\r\nstate and to set himself up against me. I have sworn to slay him. Look\r\naround you. Do you not think my army large enough to break him?”\r\n\r\n“It does not follow,” said Huangfu Li. “In ancient days in Yuchʻing,\r\nHou I, proud of and confident in his archer’s skill, gave no thought to\r\ngathering difficulties and so perished. Lately you yourself have seen\r\nthe powerful Tung Cho betrayed by Lü Pu, who had received many benefits\r\nat his hands. In no time his head was hanging over the gate. So you see\r\nmere force is not enough to ensure safety. Now you are a General, with\r\nthe axes and whips and all the symbols of rank and high office, your\r\ndescendants and all your clan occupy distinguished positions. You must\r\nconfess that the State has rewarded you liberally. True, Kuo has seized\r\nthe officers of State, but you have done the same to “The Most\r\nRevered.” Who is worse than the other?”\r\n\r\nLi angrily drew his sword and shouted, “Did the Son of Heaven send you\r\nto mock and shame me?”\r\n\r\nBut Yang Fêng checked him. “Kuo Ssŭ is still alive,” said he, “and to\r\nslay the imperial messenger would be giving him a popular excuse to\r\nraise an army against you. And all the nobles would join him.”\r\n\r\nOthers also persuaded Li and gradually his wrath cooled down. The\r\nmessenger of peace was urged to go away. But he would not be satisfied\r\nwith failure. He remained there and cried loudly, “Li Tsʻui will not\r\nobey the Emperor’s command. He will kill his Prince to set up himself.”\r\n\r\nHu Miao tried to shut his mouth saying, “Do not utter such words. You\r\nwill only bring hurt upon yourself.”\r\n\r\nBut Huangfu Li shrieked at him also. “You also are an officer of state\r\nand yet you even back up the rebel. When the prince is put to shame the\r\nminister dies. If it be my lot to suffer death at the hands of Li\r\nTsʻui, so be it!”\r\n\r\nAnd he maintained a torrent of abuse. The Emperor heard of the\r\nincident, called in Huangfu Li and sent him away to his own country.\r\n\r\nNow more than half Li Tsʻui’s men were from Hsiliang and he had also\r\nthe assistance of the Chʻiang, or tribes beyond the border. The stories\r\nspread by Huangfu Li, that Li Tsʻui was a rebel and so were those who\r\nhelped him, and that there would be a day of heavy reckoning, were\r\nreadily believed and the soldiers were much disturbed. Li Tsʻui sent\r\none of his officers to arrest Huangfu Li, but the officer had a sense\r\nof right and instead of carrying out his orders returned to say he\r\ncould not be found.\r\n\r\nChia Hsü tried to work on the feelings of the barbarian tribes. He said\r\nto them. “The Emperor knows you are loyal to him and have bravely\r\nfought and suffered. He has issued a secret command for you to go home\r\nand then he will reward you.”\r\n\r\nThe tribesmen had a grievance against Li Tsʻui for not paying them, so\r\nthey listened readily to the insidious persuasions of Chia Hsü and\r\ndeserted. Then Chia represented to the Emperor the covetous nature of\r\nLi and asked that honours be heaped upon him now that he was deserted\r\nand enfeebled. So he was raised to the rank of President of a Board of\r\nState. This delighted him greatly and he ascribed his promotion to the\r\npotency of his wise women’s prayers and incantations. He rewarded those\r\npeople most liberally.\r\n\r\nBut his army was forgotten. Wherefore Yang Fêng was angry and he said\r\nto one Sung Kuo, “We have taken all the risks and exposed ourselves to\r\nstones and arrows in his service, yet instead of giving us any reward\r\nhe ascribes all the credit to those witches of his.”\r\n\r\n“Let us put him out of the way and rescue the Emperor,” said Sung.\r\n\r\n“You explode a bomb within as signal and I will attack from outside.”\r\n\r\nSo the two agreed to act together that very night in the second watch.\r\nBut they had been overheard and the eavesdropper told Li Tsʻui. The\r\ntraitorous Sung was seized and put to death. That night Yang waited\r\noutside for the signal and while waiting, out came Li himself and found\r\nhim. Then a fight began, which lasted till the fourth watch. But Yang\r\nFêng got away and fled to Hsian (Sian) in the west.\r\n\r\nBut from this time Li Tsʻui’s army began to fall away and he felt more\r\nthan ever the losses caused by Kuo’s frequent attacks. Then came news\r\nthat Chang Chi, at the head of a large army, was coming down from the\r\nwest to make peace between the two factions. Chang said he would attack\r\nthe one who was recalcitrant. Li Tsʻui tried to gain favour by\r\nhastening to send to tell Chang Chi he was ready to make peace. So did\r\nKuo Ssŭ.\r\n\r\nSo the strife of the rival factions ended at last and Chang Chi\r\nmemorialised asking the Emperor to go to Hungnung near Loyang. He was\r\ndelighted saying he had longed to go back to the east. Chang Chi was\r\nrewarded with the title of General of Cavalry and was highly honoured.\r\nHe saw to it that the Emperor and the Court had good supplies of\r\nnecessaries. Kuo Ssŭ set free all his captive officers and Li Tsʻui\r\nprepared transport for the Court to move to the east. He told off\r\ncompanies of his veterans to escort the cavalcade.\r\n\r\nThe progress had been without incident as far as Hsinfung. Near Paling\r\nthe west wind of autumn came on to blow with great violence, but soon\r\nabove the howling of the gale was heard the trampling of a large body\r\nof horse. They stopped at a bridge and barred the way.\r\n\r\n“Who comes?” cried a voice.\r\n\r\n“The Imperial Chariot is passing and who dares stop it?” said Yang Chi,\r\nriding forward.\r\n\r\nTwo leaders advanced, “General Kuo has ordered us to guard the bridge\r\nand stop all spies. You say the Emperor is here; we must see him and\r\nthen we will let you pass.” So the beaded curtain was raised and the\r\nEmperor said, “I the Emperor am here. Why do you not retire to let me\r\npass, Gentlemen?” They all shouted, “Long Life! Long Life!” and fell\r\naway to allow the cortège through.\r\n\r\nBut when they reported what they had done Kuo was very angry. “I meant\r\nto outwit Chang Chi, seize the Emperor and hold him in Meiwu. Why have\r\nyou let him get away?”\r\n\r\nHe put the two officers to death and set out to pursue the cavalcade,\r\nand overtook it just at Huayin. The noise of a great shouting arose\r\nbehind the travellers and a loud voice commanded the chariot to stop.\r\nThe Emperor burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“Out of the wolf’s den into the tiger’s mouth!” said he.\r\n\r\nNo one knew what to do, they were all too frightened. But when the\r\nrebel army was just upon them they heard the beating of drums and from\r\nbehind some hills came into the open a cohort of soldiers preceded by a\r\ngreat flag bearing the well known name of that trusted leader, Yang\r\nFêng.\r\n\r\nNow after Yang Fêng’s defeat he had camped under Chungnanshan and had\r\ncome up to guard the Emperor as soon as he knew of his journey. Seeing\r\nit was necessary to fight now, he drew up his line of battle and Tsʻui\r\nJung, one of Kuo’s leaders, rode out and began a volley of abuse. Yang\r\nFêng turned and said, “Where is Kung-ming?”\r\n\r\nIn response out came a valiant warrior gripping a heavy battle-axe. He\r\ngalloped up on his fleet bay, making directly for Tsʻui Jung, whom he\r\nfelled at the first blow. At this the whole force dashed forward and\r\nrouted Kuo. The defeated army went back some twenty li, while Yang Fêng\r\nrode forward to see the Emperor who graciously said, “It is a great\r\nservice you have rendered; you have saved my life.”\r\n\r\nYang bowed and thanked him and the Emperor asked to see the actual\r\nslayer of the rebel leader. So he was led to the chariot where he bowed\r\nand was presented as “Hsü Huang, also known as Hsü Kung-ming, of\r\nYangchün.”\r\n\r\nThen the cavalcade went forward, Yang Fêng acting as escort as far as\r\nHuayin the halting place for the night. The General there supplied them\r\nwith clothing and food and the Emperor passed the night in Yang Fêng’s\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nNext day Kuo Ssŭ, having mustered his men, appeared in front of the\r\ncamp and Hsü Huang rode out to engage. But Kuo threw his men out so\r\nthat they entirely surrounded the camp and the Emperor was in the\r\nmiddle. The position was very critical, when help appeared in the\r\nperson of a galloping horseman from the south-east and the rebels fell\r\naway. Then Hsü Huang smote them and so scored a victory.\r\n\r\nWhen they had time to see their helper they found him to be Tung\r\nChʻêng, the “State Uncle.” The Emperor wept as he related his sorrows\r\nand dangers.\r\n\r\nSaid Tung, “Be of good courage, Sire. We pledge ourselves to kill both\r\nthe rebels and so purify the world.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor bade them travel east as soon as possible and so they went\r\non night and day till they reached their destination.\r\n\r\nKuo led his defeated army back and meeting Li Tsʻui told him of the\r\nrescue of the Emperor and whither he was going. “If they reach Shantung\r\nand get settled there, they will send out proclamations to the whole\r\ncountry, calling up the nobles to attack us and we and our families\r\nwill be in danger.”\r\n\r\n“Chang Chi holds Chʻangan and we must be careful. There is nothing to\r\nprevent a joint attack on Hungnung when we can kill the Emperor and\r\ndivide the country between us,” said Li.\r\n\r\nKuo found this a suitable scheme, so their armies came together in one\r\nplace and united in plundering the countryside. Wherever they went they\r\nleft destruction behind them. Yang and Tung heard of their approach\r\nwhen they were yet a long way off so they turned back to meet them and\r\nfought the rebels at Tungchien.\r\n\r\nThe two rebels had previously made their plan. Since the loyal troops\r\nwere few as compared with their own horde they would overwhelm them\r\nlike a flood. So when the day of battle came they poured out covering\r\nthe hills and filling the plains. The two leaders devoted themselves\r\nsolely to the protection of the Emperor and the Empress. The officials,\r\nthe attendants, the archives and records and all the paraphernalia of\r\nthe Court were left to care for themselves. The rebels ravaged\r\nHungnung, but the two faithful soldiers got the Emperor safely away\r\ninto the north of Shênsi.\r\n\r\nWhen the rebels showed signs of pursuit Yang and Tung sent to offer to\r\ndiscuss terms of peace, at the same time sending a secret edict to\r\nHotung calling upon the old “White Wave General” Han and Li Yüeh and Hu\r\nTsʻai for help. Li Yüeh was actually a brigand but the need for help\r\nwas desperate.\r\n\r\nThese three being promised pardon for their faults and crimes and a\r\ngrant of official rank, naturally responded to the call and thus the\r\nloyal side was strengthened so that Hungnung was recaptured. But\r\nmeanwhile the rebels laid waste whatever place they reached, slaying\r\nthe aged and weakly, forcing the strong to join their ranks. When going\r\ninto a fight they forced these people-soldiers to the front and they\r\ncalled them the “Dare-to-die” soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe rebel force was very strong. When Li Yüeh, the late brigand,\r\napproached, Kuo Ssŭ bade his men scatter clothing and valuables along\r\nthe road. The late robbers could not resist the temptation so a\r\nscramble began. The rebels fell upon the disordered ranks and did much\r\ndamage. Yang and Tung could not save them so they took the Emperor away\r\nto the north.\r\n\r\nBut the rebels pursued. Li Yüeh said, “The danger is grave. I pray Your\r\nMajesty to mount a horse and go in advance.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor replied, “I cannot bear to abandon my officers.”\r\n\r\nThey wept and struggled on as best they could. Hu Tsʻai was killed in\r\none attack. The enemy came very near and the Emperor left his carriage\r\nand went on foot to the river where they sought a boat to ferry him to\r\nthe other side. The weather was very cold and the Emperor and Empress\r\ncuddled up close to each other shivering. They reached the river but\r\nthe banks were too high and they could not get down into the boat. So\r\nYang Fêng proposed to fasten together the horses’ bridles and lower\r\ndown the Emperor slung by the waist. However, some rolls of white silk\r\nwere found and they rolled up the two imperial personages in the silk\r\nand thus they lowered them down near the boat. Then Li Yüeh took up his\r\nposition in the prow leaning on his sword. The brother of the Empress\r\ncarried her on his back into the boat.\r\n\r\nThe boat was too small to carry everybody and those unable to get on\r\nboard clung to the cable, but Li Yüeh cut them down and they fell into\r\nthe water. They ferried over the Emperor and then sent back the boat\r\nfor the others. There was a great scramble to get on board and they had\r\nto chop off the fingers and hands of those who persisted in clinging to\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nThe lamentation rose to the heavens. When they mustered on the farther\r\nbank many were missing, not a score of the Emperor’s suite were left. A\r\nbullock cart was found in which the Emperor travelled to Tayang. They\r\nhad no food and at night sought shelter in a poor, tile-roofed house.\r\nThe cottagers gave them some boiled millet but it was too coarse to be\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\nNext day the Emperor conferred titles on those who had protected him so\r\nfar and they pushed on. Soon two officers of rank came up with the\r\ncortège and they bowed before His Majesty with many tears. They were\r\nYang Piao and Han Jung. The Emperor and Empress lifted up their voices\r\nand wept with them.\r\n\r\nSaid Han Jung to his colleague, “The rebels have confidence in my\r\nwords. You stay as guard of the Emperor and I will take my life in my\r\nhands and try to bring about peace.”\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone the Emperor rested for a time in Yang’s camp and then\r\nwas requested to make Anihsien the capital. But the town contained not\r\na single lofty building and the court lived in grass huts devoid even\r\nof doors. They surrounded these with a fence of thorns as a protection,\r\nand within this the Emperor held counsel with his ministers. The\r\nsoldiers camped round the fence.\r\n\r\nLi Yüeh and his fellow ruffians showed their true colours. They wielded\r\nthe powers of the Emperor as they wished and officials who offended\r\nthem were beaten or abused even in the presence of the Emperor. They\r\npurposely provided thick wine and coarse food for the Emperor’s\r\nconsumption. He struggled to swallow what they sent. Li Yüeh and Han\r\nHsien joined in recommending to the throne the names of convicts,\r\ncommon soldiers, sorcerers, leeches and such people who thus obtained\r\nofficial ranks. There were more than two hundred of such people. As\r\nseals could not be engraved pieces of metal were hammered into some\r\nsort of a shape.\r\n\r\nNow Han Jung went to see the two rebels who listened to him and set\r\nfree the officials and palace people.\r\n\r\nA famine occurred that same year and people were reduced to eating\r\ngrass from the roadside. Starving they wandered hither and thither but\r\nfood and clothing were sent to the Emperor from the surrounding\r\ndistricts and the Court began to enjoy a little repose.\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng and Yang Fêng sent workmen to restore the palaces in Loyang\r\nwith the intention of moving the Court thither. Li Yüeh was opposed to\r\nthis and when argued with, that Loyang was really the capital as\r\nopposed to the paltry town of Ani, and removal would be but reasonable,\r\nhe wound up by saying, “You may get the Court to remove but I shall\r\nremain here.”\r\n\r\nBut when the consent of the Emperor had been given and a start made Li\r\nYüeh secretly sent to arrange with Li Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ to capture him.\r\nHowever, this plot leaked out and the escort so arranged as to prevent\r\nsuch a thing and they pressed on to Chikuan as rapidly as possible. Li\r\nheard this and without waiting for his colleagues to join him set out\r\nto act alone.\r\n\r\nAbout the fourth watch, just as the cavalcade was passing Chikuan, a\r\nvoice was heard shouting, “Stop those carriages! Li and Kuo are here.”\r\n\r\nThis frightened the Emperor greatly and his terror increased when he\r\nsaw the whole mountain side suddenly light up.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The rebel party, erstwhile split in twain,\r\n        To work their wicked will now join again.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Son of Heaven escaped this peril will be told in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO MÊNG-TÊ MOVES THE COURT:\r\nLÜ FÊNG-HSIEN RAIDS HSÜCHUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter closed with the arrival of Li Yüeh who shouted out\r\nfalsely that the army was that of the two arch rebels Li and Kuo come\r\nto capture the imperial cavalcade. But Yang Fêng recognised the voice\r\nof Li Yüeh and bade Hsü Huang go out to fight him. He went and in the\r\nfirst bout the traitor fell. His men scattered and the travellers got\r\nsafely through Chikuan. Here the Prefect, Chang Yang, supplied them\r\nplentifully with food and other necessaries and escorted the Emperor to\r\nChihtao. For his timely help the Emperor conferred upon Chang Yang the\r\nrank of a Ta-ssŭ-ma, or President, and he went and camped at Yehwang.\r\n\r\nLoyang was presently entered. Within the walls all was destruction. The\r\npalaces and halls had been burned, the streets were overgrown with\r\ngrass and brambles and obstructed by heaps of ruins. The palaces and\r\ncourts were represented by broken roofs and toppling walls. A small\r\n“palace” however was soon built and therein the officers of court\r\npresented their congratulations, standing in the open air among thorn\r\nbushes and brambles. The reign style was changed from Hsing-Pʻing to\r\nChien-An (firm tranquillity).\r\n\r\nThe year was a year of grievous famine. The Loyang people, even reduced\r\nin numbers as they were to a few hundreds, had not enough to eat and\r\nthey prowled about stripping the bark off trees and grubbing up the\r\nroots of plants to satisfy their starving hunger. Officers of the\r\nGovernment of all but the highest ranks went out into the country to\r\ngather fuel. Many people lay down and died quietly behind the ruined\r\nwalls of their houses. At no time during the decadence of Han did\r\nmisery press harder than at this period.\r\n\r\nA poem written in pity for the sufferings of that time says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mortally wounded, the serpent poured forth his life blood at\r\n                                                             Mantang;\r\n    Blood-red pennons of war waved then in every quarter,\r\n    Chieftain with chieftain strove and raided each other’s borders,\r\n    ’Midst the turmoil and strife the Kingship even was threatened.\r\n    Wickedness stalks in a country when the King is a weakling,\r\n    Brigandage always is rife, when a dynasty’s failing,\r\n    Had one a heart of iron, wholly devoid of feeling,\r\n    Yet would one surely grieve at the sight of such desolation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tai-yü Yang Piao memorialised the Throne saying, “The decree issued\r\nto me some time ago has never been acted upon. Now Tsʻao Tsʻao is very\r\nstrong in Shantung and it would be well to associate him in the\r\ngovernment that he might support the ruling house.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor replied, “There was no need to refer to the matter again.\r\nSend a messenger when you will.”\r\n\r\nSo the decree went forth and a messenger bore it into Shantung. Now\r\nwhen Tsʻao had heard that the Court had returned to Loyang he called\r\ntogether his advisers to consult. Hsün Yü laid the matter before him\r\nand the council thus:—“Of old Duke Wen supported Prince Hsiang of the\r\nChou dynasty and all the feudal lords backed him. The founder of the\r\nHans won the popular favour by wearing mourning for the Emperor I (who\r\nnever really sat on the throne). Now the Emperor has been a fugitive on\r\nthe dusty roads. To take the lead in offering an army to restore him to\r\nhonour is to have an unrivalled opportunity to win universal regard.\r\nBut you must act quickly or some one will get in before you.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao understood and at once prepared his army to move. Just at\r\nthis moment an imperial messenger was announced with the very command\r\nhe wanted and he immediately set out.\r\n\r\nAt Loyang everything was desolate. The walls had fallen and there were\r\nno means of rebuilding them, while rumours and reports of the coming of\r\nLi and Kuo kept up a state of constant anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe frightened Emperor spoke with Yang Fêng saying, “What can be done?\r\nThere is no answer from Shantung and our enemies are near.”\r\n\r\nThen Yang Fêng and Han Hsien said, “We, your ministers, will fight to\r\nthe death for you.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng said, “The fortifications are weak and our military\r\nresources small, so that we cannot hope for victory and what does\r\ndefeat mean? I see nothing better to propose than a move into\r\nShantung.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor agreed to this and the journey began without further\r\npreparation. There being few horses, the officers of the Court had to\r\nmarch afoot. Hardly a bowshot outside the gate they saw a thick cloud\r\nof dust out of which came all the clash and clamour of an advancing\r\narmy. The Emperor and his Consort were dumb with fear. Then appeared a\r\nhorseman; he was the messenger returning from Shantung. He rode up to\r\nthe chariot, made an obeisance and said, “General Tsʻao, as commanded,\r\nis coming with all the military force of Shantung, but hearing that Li\r\nand Kuo had again approached the capital he has sent Hsiahou Tun in\r\nadvance. With him are many capable leaders and five legions of proved\r\nsoldiers. They will guard Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nAll fear was swept away. Soon after Hsiahou Tun and his staff arrived\r\nand they were presented to the Emperor who graciously addressed them.\r\n\r\nThen one came to say a large army was approaching from the east and at\r\nthe Emperor’s command Hsiahou Tun went to ascertain who these were. He\r\nsoon returned saying they were Tsʻao Tsʻao’s infantry.\r\n\r\nIn a short time Tsʻao Hung and his officers came to the chariot and\r\ntheir names having been duly communicated the chief said, “When my\r\nbrother heard of the approach of the rebels he feared that the advance\r\nguard he had sent might be too weak so he sent me to march quickly and\r\nreinforce him.”\r\n\r\n“General Tsʻao is indeed a trusty servant,” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\nOrders were given to advance, the escort leading. By and by scouts came\r\nto say that the rebels were coming up very quickly. The Emperor bade\r\nHsiahou Tun divide his force into two parts to oppose them, whereupon\r\nthe armies threw out two wings with cavalry in front and foot behind.\r\nThey attacked with vigour and beat off the rebels with great loss. Then\r\nthey begged the Emperor to return to Loyang and Hsiahou Tun guarded the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nSoon Tsʻao Tsʻao came with his great army and having got them duly\r\ncamped he went into the city to audience. He knelt at the foot of the\r\nsteps, but was called up hither to stand beside the Emperor and be\r\nthanked.\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “Having been the recipient of great bounty thy servant\r\nowes the State much gratitude. The measure of evil of the two rebels is\r\nfull, I have a score of legions of good soldiers to oppose them and\r\nthey are fully equal to securing the safety of Your Majesty and the\r\nThrone. The preservation of the state sacrifice is the matter of real\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\nHigh honours were conferred on Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThe two rebels wished to attack Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army while fatigued from\r\nits long march, but their adviser Chia Hsü opposed this, saying there\r\nwas no hope of victory. In fact he advised submission. Li Tsʻui was\r\nangry at the suggestion, saying that the adviser wished to dishearten\r\nthe army and drew his sword on Chia. But the other officers interceded\r\nand saved him. That same night Chia stole out of the camp and, quite\r\nalone, took his way home to his native village.\r\n\r\nSoon the rebels decided to offer battle. Tsʻao sent out in reply a\r\nsmall company of horse with three warriors as leaders. These dashed\r\ninto the rebels army but quickly retired. This manœuvre was repeated,\r\nand again repeated before the real battle array was formed. Then Li\r\nHsien and Li Pieh, nephews of Li Tsʻui, rode out. At once from Tsʻao’s\r\nside dashed out Hsü Chʻu and cut down the former. Li Pieh was so\r\nstartled that he fell out of the saddle. He too was slain. The victor\r\nrode back to his own side with the two heads. When he offered them to\r\nthe chief, Tsʻao Tsʻao patted him on the back crying, “You are really\r\nmy Fan Kʻuai! (Preserver).”\r\n\r\nNext a general move forward was made, Hsiahou Tun and Tsʻao Jên leading\r\nthe two wings and Tsʻao Tsʻao in the centre. They advanced to the roll\r\nof the drum. The rebels fell back before them and presently fled. They\r\nwere pursued, Tsʻao himself leading, sword in hand. Many were killed\r\nand many more surrendered. The two leaders went west, flying in panic\r\nlike dogs from a falling house. Having no place of refuge they took to\r\nthe hills and hid among the brushwood.\r\n\r\nThe army returned and camped again near the city. Then Yang Fêng and\r\nHan Hsien said one to another, “This Tsʻao has done a great service and\r\nhe will be the man in power. There will be no place for us.” So they\r\nrepresented to the Emperor that they wished to pursue the rebels and\r\nunder this excuse withdrew and camped at Taliang.\r\n\r\nOne day the Emperor sent to summon Tsʻao Tsʻao to audience. The\r\nmessenger was called in. Tsʻao noticed that he looked remarkably well\r\nand could not understand it seeing that everyone else looked hungry and\r\nfamine stricken. So he said, “You look plump and well, Sir, how do you\r\nmanage it?”\r\n\r\n“Only this; I have lived maigre for thirty years.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao nodded. “What office do you hold?”\r\n\r\n“I am a graduate. I had an office under Yüan Shao, but came here when\r\nthe Emperor returned. Now I am one of the secretaries. I am a native of\r\nTingtʻao called Tung Chao.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao got up from his place and crossed over saying, “I have heard of\r\nyou. How happy I am to meet you!”\r\n\r\nThen wine was brought into the tent and Hsün Yü was called in and\r\nintroduced. While they were talking a man came in to report that a\r\nparty was moving eastward. Orders were given to find out whose men\r\nthese were but the visitor knew at once. “They are old leaders under\r\nthe rebels, Yang Fêng and the “White Wave General” Han. They are\r\nrunning off because you have come, Illustrious Sir!”\r\n\r\n“Do they mistrust me?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“They are not worthy of your attention. They are a poor lot.”\r\n\r\n“What of this departure of Li and Kuo?”\r\n\r\n“Tigers without claws, birds without wings will not escape you very\r\nlong. They are not worth thinking about.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao saw that he and his guest had much in common so he began to\r\ntalk of affairs of State.\r\n\r\nSaid Tung Chao, “You, Illustrious Sir, with your noble army have swept\r\naway rebellion and have become the mainstay of the throne, an\r\nachievement worthy of the five chieftains. But the officials will look\r\nat it in very different ways and not all favourably to you. I think you\r\nwould not be wise to remain here and I advise a change of capital to\r\nHsütu in Honan. However, it must be remembered that the restoration of\r\nthe capital has been published far and wide and the attention of all\r\nthe people is concentrated on Loyang, hoping for a period of rest and\r\ntranquillity. Another move will displease many. However, the\r\nperformance of extraordinary service may mean the acquisition of\r\nextraordinary merit. It is for you to decide.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly my own inclination!” said Tsʻao Tsʻao, seizing his guest’s\r\nhand. “But are there not dangers? Yang Fêng at Taliang and the Court\r\nofficials?”\r\n\r\n“That is easily managed. Write to Yang and set his mind at rest. Say\r\nplainly that there is no food in the capital here and so you are going\r\nto another place where there is, and where there is no danger of\r\nscarcity. When the higher officials hear it they will approve.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao had now decided and as his guest took leave he seized his\r\nhands once more saying, “All my success I shall only owe to you.”\r\n\r\nTung Chao thanked and left. Thereafter Tsʻao and his advisers secretly\r\ndiscussed the change of capital.\r\n\r\nNow as to that a certain official named Wang Li, who was a student of\r\nastrology, said to one Liu Ai, “I have been studying the stars. Since\r\nlast spring Venus has been nearing the ‘Guard’ star in the\r\nneighbourhood of the ‘Measure,’ and the ‘Cowherd’ [5] crossing the\r\nRiver of Heaven. [6] Mars has been retrograding and came into\r\nconjunction with Venus in the Gate of Heaven, [7] so that ‘Metal’ and\r\n‘Fire’ are mingled. Thence must emerge a new ruler. The aura of the\r\nHans is exhausted and Chin and Wei must increase.”\r\n\r\nA secret memorial was presented to the Emperor Hsien saying, “The\r\nMandate of Heaven has its course and the five elements are out of\r\nproportion. ‘Earth’ is attacking ‘Fire’ and the successor to the Empire\r\nof Han is in Wei.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao heard of these sayings and memorials and sent a man to the\r\nastrologer to say, “Your loyalty is well known, but the ways of Heaven\r\nare past finding out. The less said the better.”\r\n\r\nHsün, the adviser, expounded the meaning thus: “The virtue of Han was\r\nfire; your element is earth. Hsütu is under the influence of earth and\r\nso your fortune depends on getting there. Fire can overcome earth, as\r\nearth can multiply wood. Tung Chao and the astrologer agree and you\r\nhave only to bide your time.”\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao made up his mind. Next day at Court he said, “The capital is\r\ndeserted and cannot be restored nor can it be supplied easily with\r\nfood. Hsütu is a noble city, standing close to a fruitful district. It\r\nis everything that a capital should be. I venture to request that the\r\nCourt move thither.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor dared not oppose and the officials were too overawed to\r\nhave any independent opinion so they chose a day to set out. Tsʻao\r\ncommanded the escort and the officials all followed. When they had\r\ntravelled a few stages they saw before them a high mound and from\r\nbehind this there arose the beating of drums. Then Yang and Han came\r\nout and barred the way. In front of all stood Hsü Huang, who shouted,\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao is stealing away the Emperor!”\r\n\r\nTsʻao rode out and took a good look at this man. He seemed a fine\r\nfellow and in his secret soul Tsʻao greatly admired him, although he\r\nwas an enemy. Then he ordered Hsü Chʻu to go and fight him. The combat\r\nwas axe against broadsword and the two men fought more than half a\r\nhundred bouts without advantage to either side. Tsʻao then beat the\r\ngongs and drew off his men.\r\n\r\nIn the camp a council was called. Tsʻao said, “The two rebels\r\nthemselves need not be discussed; but Hsü Huang is a fine captain and I\r\nwas unwilling to use any great force against him. I want to win him\r\nover to our side.”\r\n\r\nAn officer, Man Chʻung, replied, “Do not let that trouble you; I will\r\nhave a word with him. I shall disguise myself as a soldier this evening\r\nand steal over to the enemy’s camp to talk to him. I shall incline his\r\nheart toward you.”\r\n\r\nThat night Man Chʻung, duly disguised, got over to the other side and\r\nmade his way to the tent of Hsü Huang, who sat there by the light of a\r\ncandle. He was still wearing his coat of mail. Suddenly Chʻung ran out\r\nin front and saluted saying, “You have been well since we parted, old\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\nHsü jumped up in surprise, gazed into the face of the speaker a long\r\ntime and presently said, “What! you are Man Po-ning of Shanyang? What\r\nare you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“I am an officer in General Tsʻao’s army. Seeing my old friend out in\r\nfront of the army to-day I wanted to say a word to him. So I took the\r\nrisk of stealing in this evening and here I am.”\r\n\r\nHsü Huang invited him in and they sat down. Then said Man Chʻung,\r\n“There are very few as bold as you on the earth; why then do you serve\r\nsuch as your present chiefs? My master is the most prominent man in the\r\nworld, a man who delights in wise men and appreciates soldiers as every\r\none knows. Your valour to-day won his entire admiration and so he took\r\ncare that the attack was not vigorous enough to sacrifice you. Now he\r\nhas sent me to invite you to join him. Will you not leave darkness for\r\nlight and help him in his magnificent task?”\r\n\r\nHsü Huang sat a long time pondering over the offer. Then he said, with\r\na sigh, “I know my masters are doomed to failure, but I have followed\r\ntheir fortunes a long time and do not like to leave them.”\r\n\r\n“But you know the prudent bird selects its tree and the wise servant\r\nchooses his master. When one meets a worthy master and lets him go one\r\nis a fool.”\r\n\r\n“I am willing to do what you say,” said Hsü, rising.\r\n\r\n“Why not put these two to death as an introductory gift?” said Man.\r\n\r\n“It is very wrong for a servant to slay his master. I will not do\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“True; you are really a good man.”\r\n\r\nThen Hsü, taking only a few horsemen of his own men with him, left that\r\nnight and deserted to Tsʻao Tsʻao. Soon some one took the news to Yang\r\nFêng, who at the head of a strong company of horsemen, set out to\r\ncapture the deserter. He called out to him to come back.\r\n\r\nBut when Yang was getting near he fell into an ambush. Suddenly the\r\nwhole mountain-side was lit up with torches and out sprang Tsʻao’s men,\r\nhe himself being in command. “I have been waiting here a long time; do\r\nnot run away,” cried he.\r\n\r\nYang Fêng was completely surprised and tried to draw off, but was\r\nquickly surrounded. His colleague came to his rescue and a confused\r\nbattle began. Yang Fêng succeeded in escaping, while Tsʻao Tsʻao kept\r\nup the attack on the disordered army. A great number of the rebels gave\r\nin and the leaders found they had too few men left to maintain their\r\nindependence so they betook themselves to Yüan Shu.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao returned to camp the newly surrendered man was\r\npresented and well received. Then again the cavalcade set out for the\r\nnew capital. In due time they reached it and they built palaces and\r\nhalls and an ancestral temple and an altar, terraces and public\r\noffices. The walls were repaired, storehouses built and all put in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThen came the rewards for Tsʻao Tsʻao’s adherents. Thirteen were raised\r\nto rank of hou, or marquis. All good service was rewarded; certain\r\nothers again, who deserved it, were punished, all according to Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s sole decision. He himself was made a Generalissimo and Marquis\r\nof Wupʻing. The advisers became Presidents of Boards and filled such\r\noffices. Mao Chieh and Jên Hsün were put over the military stores. Tung\r\nChao was made magistrate of Loyang and Man Chʻung of Hsütu. All good\r\nservice received full recognition.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was then the one man of the Court. All memorials went first\r\nto him and were then submitted to the Throne.\r\n\r\nWhen State matters were in order a great banquet was given in his\r\nprivate quarters to all Tsʻao’s advisers, and affairs outside the\r\ncapital were the subject of discussion. Then Tsʻao Tsʻao said, “Liu Pei\r\nhas his army at Hsüchou and he carries on the administration of the\r\nprefecture. Lü Pu fled to him when defeated and Pei gave him Hsiaopʻei\r\nto live in. If these two agreed to join forces and attack, my position\r\nwould be most serious. What precautions can be taken?”\r\n\r\nThen rose Hsü Chʻu, saying, “Give me five legions and I will give the\r\nMinister both their heads.”\r\n\r\nHsün Yü said, “O Leader, you are brave, but you are no strategist. You\r\ncannot start sudden war just as the capital has been changed. However,\r\nthere is a certain ruse known as The Rival Tigers. Liu Pei has no\r\ndecree authorising him to govern the district. You, Illustrious Sir,\r\ncan procure one for him, and when sending it, and so conferring upon\r\nhim right in addition to his might, you can enclose a private note\r\ntelling him to get rid of Lü Pu. If he does, then he will have lost a\r\nvigorous warrior from his side and he could be dealt with as occasions\r\nserve. Should he fail, then Lü Pu will slay him. This is The Rival\r\nTiger ruse; they wrangle and bite each other.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao agreed that this was a good plan so he memorialised for the\r\nformal appointment, which he sent to Liu Pei. Pei was created General\r\n“Conqueror of the East” and a Marquis as well. At the same time a\r\nprivate note was enclosed.\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei heard of the change of capital he began to prepare a\r\ncongratulatory address. In the midst of this an imperial messenger was\r\nannounced and was met which all ceremony outside the gate. When the\r\nepistle had been reverently received a banquet was prepared for the\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\nThe messenger said, “This decree was obtained for you by the Minister\r\nTsʻao.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê thanked him. Then the messenger drew forth his secret letter.\r\nWhen he had read this Liu Pei said, “This matter can be easily\r\narranged.”\r\n\r\nThe banquet over and the messenger conducted to his lodging to seek\r\nrepose, Yüan-tê, before going to rest, called in his councillors to\r\nconsider the letter.\r\n\r\n“There need be no compunction about putting him to death,” said Chang\r\nFei; “he is a bad man.”\r\n\r\n“But he came to me for protection in his weakness, how can I put him to\r\ndeath? That would be immoral,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“If he was a good man; it would be difficult,” replied Fei.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei would not consent. Next day, when Lü Pu came to offer\r\ncongratulations, he was received as usual. He said, “I have come to\r\nfelicitate you on the receipt of the imperial bounty.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei thanked him in due form. But then he saw Chang Fei draw his\r\nsword and come up the hall as if to slay Lü Pu. He hastily interfered\r\nand stopped him. Lü Pu was surprised and said, “Why do you wish to slay\r\nme, I-tê?”\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao says you are immoral and tells my brother to kill you,”\r\nshouted Chang Fei.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei shouted again and again to him to go away, and he led Lü Pu\r\ninto the private apartments out of the way.\r\n\r\nThen he told him the whole story and showed him the secret letter. He\r\nwept as he finished reading.\r\n\r\n“This is that miscreant’s scheme for sowing discord between us.”\r\n\r\n“Be not anxious, elder brother,” said Liu Pei. “I pledge myself not to\r\nbe guilty of such an infamous crime.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu again and again expressed his gratitude and Liu Pei kept him for\r\na time. They remained talking and drinking wine till late.\r\n\r\nSaid the other two brothers, “Why not kill him?”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei said, “Because Tsʻao Mêng-tê fears that Lü and I may attack\r\nhim, he is trying to separate us and get us to ‘swallow’ each other,\r\nwhile he steps in and takes the advantage. Is there any other reason?”\r\n\r\nKuan nodded assent, but Chang Fei said, “I want to get him out of the\r\nway lest he trouble us later.”\r\n\r\n“That is not what a noble man should do,” said his elder brother.\r\n\r\nSoon the messenger was dismissed and returned to the capital with the\r\nreply from Liu Pei. The letter only said the plan would be made later.\r\nBut the messenger, when he saw Tsʻao Tsʻao, told him the story of Liu\r\nPei’s pledge to Lü Pu. Then said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “The plan has failed;\r\nwhat next?”\r\n\r\nHsün Yu replied, “I have another trick called ‘The Tiger and the Wolf’\r\nin which the tiger is made to gobble up the wolf.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hear it,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Send to Yüan Shu to say that Liu Pei has sent up a secret memorial\r\nthat he wishes to subdue the southern districts. Shu will be angry and\r\nattack him. Then you will order Pei to dispose of Shu and so set them\r\ndestroying each other. Lü Pu will certainly think that is his chance\r\nand turn traitor. This is The Tiger-Wolf trick.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao thought this good and sent the messenger and also sent a false\r\nedict to Liu Pei. When this came the messenger was received with all\r\nthe ceremonies and the edict ordered the capture of Yüan Shu. After the\r\ndeparture of the bearer Liu called Mi Chu who pronounced it a ruse.\r\n\r\n“It may be,” said his master, “but the royal command is not to be\r\ndisobeyed.”\r\n\r\nSo the army was prepared and the day fixed. Sun Chʻien said that a\r\ntrusty man must be left on guard and Pei asked which of his brothers\r\nwould undertake this task.\r\n\r\n“I will guard the city,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“I am constantly in need of your advice so how can we part?”\r\n\r\n“I will guard the city,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“You will fail,” said Pei. “After one of your drinking bouts you will\r\nget savage and flog the soldiers. Beside you are rash and will not\r\nlisten to any one’s advice. I shall be uneasy all the time.”\r\n\r\n“Henceforth I drink no more wine. I will not beat the soldiers and I\r\nwill always listen to advice,” said Fei.\r\n\r\n“I fear the mouth does not correspond to the heart,” said Mi Chu.\r\n\r\n“I have followed my elder brother these many years and never broken\r\nfaith; why should you be contemptuous?” said Fei.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “Though you say this I do not feel quite satisfied. I\r\nwill order friend Yüan-lung to help you and keep you sober. Then you\r\nwill not make any mistake.”\r\n\r\nChʻên Têng was willing to undertake this duty and the final orders were\r\ngiven. The army of three legions, horse and foot, left Hsüchou and\r\nmarched toward Nanyang.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan Shu heard that a memorial had been presented proposing to\r\ntake possession of this district he broke out into abuse of Liu Pei.\r\n“You weaver of mats! You plaiter of straw shoes! You have been smart\r\nenough to get possession of a large district and elbow your way into\r\nthe ranks of the nobles. I was just going to attack you and now you\r\ndare to scheme against me! How I detest you!”\r\n\r\nSo he at once gave orders to prepare an army of ten legions, under Chi\r\nLing, to attack Hsüchou. The armies met at Hsüi, where Liu Pei was\r\nencamped in a plain with hills behind and a stream on his flank, for\r\nhis army was small.\r\n\r\nChi Ling, his opponent, was a native of Shantung. He used a very heavy\r\nthree-edged sword. After he had made his camp he rode out and began\r\nabusing his opponents. “Liu Pei, you rustic bumpkin, how dare you\r\ninvade this land?”\r\n\r\n“I have a decree ordering me to destroy the minister who behaves\r\nimproperly. If you oppose you will be assuredly punished,” replied Pei.\r\n\r\nChi angrily rode out brandishing his weapon. But Kuan Yü cried, “Fool,\r\ndo not attempt to fight!” and rode out to meet him. Then they two\r\nfought and after thirty bouts neither had an advantage. Then Chi cried\r\nout for a rest. So Kuan turned his horse away, rode back to his own\r\narray and waited for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the moment came to renew the combat Chi sent out one of his\r\nofficers to take his place. But Kuan said, “Tell Chi Ling to come: I\r\nmust settle with him who shall be cock and who shall be hen.”\r\n\r\n“You are a reputationless leader and unworthy to fight with our\r\ngeneral,” replied the officer, Hsün Chêng.\r\n\r\nThis reply angered Kuan, who made just one attack on Hsün and brought\r\nhim to the ground. At this success Liu Pei urged on the army and Chi\r\nLing’s men were defeated. They retired to the mouth of the Huaiyin\r\nRiver and declined all challenges.\r\n\r\nHowever, many of their men came privately into Liu Pei’s camp to try to\r\ndo what mischief they could and many, so found, were slain.\r\n\r\nBut the armies will be left facing each other while we relate what\r\nhappened in Hsüchou.\r\n\r\nAfter Liu Pei had started on his expedition Chang Fei placed his\r\ncolleague and helper in charge of the administration of Hsüchou,\r\nkeeping military affairs under his own supervision. After thinking over\r\nthe matter for some time he gave a banquet to all the military officers\r\nand when they were all seated he made a speech. “Before my brother left\r\nhe bade me keep clear of the wine cup for fear of accidents. Now,\r\ngentlemen, you may drink deep to-day but from to-morrow wine is\r\nforbidden for we must keep the city safe. So take your fill.” And with\r\nthis he and all his guests rose to drink together.\r\n\r\nThe wine bearer came to one Tsʻao Pao who declined it, saying he never\r\ndrank as he was forbidden of heaven.\r\n\r\n“What! a fighting man not drink wine!” said the host. “I want you to\r\ntake just one cup.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Pao was afraid to offend so he drank.\r\n\r\nNow the host drank huge goblets with all his guests on every hand and\r\nso swallowed a huge quantity of liquor. He became quite intoxicated.\r\nYet he would drink more and insisted on a cup with every guest. It came\r\nto the turn of Tsʻao Pao who declined.\r\n\r\n“Really, I cannot drink,” said Pao.\r\n\r\n“You drank just now: why refuse this time?”\r\n\r\nChang Fei pressed him, but still Tsʻao Pao resisted. Then Fei in his\r\ndrunken madness lost control of his temper and said, “If you disobey\r\nthe orders of your general you shall be beaten.” And he called in his\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nHere Chʻên Yüan-lung interfered reminding him of the strict injunctions\r\nof his brother.\r\n\r\n“You civilians attend to your civil business and leave us alone,” said\r\nFei.\r\n\r\nThe only way of escape for the guest was to beg remission and he did\r\nso, but added, “Sir, if you saw my son-in-law’s face you would pardon\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Who is your son-in-law?”\r\n\r\n“Lü Pu.”\r\n\r\n“I did not mean to have you really beaten, but if you think to frighten\r\nme with Lü Pu I will. I will beat you as if I was beating him,” said\r\nFei.\r\n\r\nThe guests interposed to beg him off, but their drunken host was\r\nobdurate and the unhappy guest received fifty blows. Then at the\r\nearnest prayers of the others the remainder of the punishment was\r\nremitted.\r\n\r\nThe banquet came to an end and the beaten man went away burning with\r\nresentment. That night he sent a letter to Hsiaopʻei relating the\r\ninsults he had received from Chang Fei. The letter told Lü Pu of the\r\nprefect’s absence and proposed that a sudden raid should be made that\r\nvery night before Chang Fei had recovered from his drunken fit. Lü Pu\r\nat once summoned Chʻên Kung and told him.\r\n\r\n“This is only a place to occupy temporarily,” said Kung. “If you can\r\nseize Hsüchou, do so. It is a good chance.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu got ready at once and soon on the way with half a company,\r\nordering Chʻên Kung to follow him with the main body. Kao Shun was to\r\nfollow him.\r\n\r\nHsiaopʻei being only about forty li away, one gets there almost as soon\r\nas one is mounted and Lü Pu was under the walls at the fourth watch. It\r\nwas clear moonlight. No one on the ramparts saw him. Pu came up close\r\nto the wall and called out, “Liu Pei’s secret messenger has arrived.”\r\n\r\nThe guards on the wall were Tsʻao Pao’s men and they called him. He\r\ncame and when he saw who was there he ordered the gates to be opened.\r\nLü Pu gave the secret signal and the soldiers entered shouting.\r\n\r\nChang Fei was in his apartment sleeping off the fumes of wine. His\r\nservants hastened to arouse him and told him an enemy had got the gates\r\nopen and was in the city. Chang savagely got into his armour and laid\r\nhold of his mighty spear, but as he was mounting his horse at the gate\r\nthe soldiers came up. He rushed at them but being still half\r\nintoxicated made but a poor fight. Lü Pu knowing his prowess did not\r\npress him hard and Chang Fei made his way, with a small escort, to the\r\neast gate, and there went out, leaving his brother’s family to their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Pao, seeing Chang had but a very small force and was still half\r\ndrunk as well, came in pursuit. Fei saw who it was and was mad with\r\nrage. He galloped toward him and drove him off after a few passes. He\r\nfollowed Pao to the moat and wounded him in the back. His frightened\r\nsteed carried him into the moat and he was drowned.\r\n\r\nOnce well outside the city Chang Fei collected his men and they rode\r\noff toward the south.\r\n\r\nLü Pu having surprised the city set himself to restore order. He put a\r\nguard over the residence of Liu Pei so that no one should disturb the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nChang Fei with his few followers went to his brother’s camp and told\r\nhis story of treachery and surprise. All were greatly distressed.\r\n\r\n“Success is not worth rejoicing over; failure is not worth grieving\r\nover,” said Liu Pei with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Where are our sisters?” asked Kuan.\r\n\r\n“They shared the fate of the city.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei nodded his head and was silent.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü with an effort controlled his reproaches and said, “What did\r\nyou say when you promised to guard the city and what orders did our\r\nbrother give you? Now the city is lost and therewith our\r\nsisters-in-law. Have you done well?”\r\n\r\nChang Fei was overwhelmed by remorse. He drew his sword to kill\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n        He raised the cup in pledge,\r\n            None might say nay;\r\n        Remorseful, drew the sword,\r\n            Himself to slay.\r\n\r\n\r\nChang Fei’s fate will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTʻAISHIH TZŬ FIGHTS FOR FRIENDSHIP’S SAKE:\r\nSUN PO-FU DOES BATTLE WITH YEN, THE WHITE TIGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter it was recorded that Chang Fei was about to end his\r\nlife with his own weapon. But his brother rushed forward and caught him\r\nin his arms, snatched away the sword and threw it on the earth saying,\r\n“Brothers are hands and feet; wives and children are as clothing. You\r\nmay mend your torn dress, but who can re-attach a lost limb? We three,\r\nby the Oath of the Peach Garden, swore to seek the same death-day. The\r\ncity is lost, it is true, and my wife and little ones, but I could not\r\nbear that we should die ere our course be run. Beside, the city was not\r\nreally mine and Lü Pu will not harm my family but will rather seek to\r\npreserve them. You made a mistake, worthy brother, but is it one\r\ndeserving of death?”\r\n\r\nAnd he wept. His brothers were much affected and their tears fell in\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of Lü Pu’s successful seizure of his protector’s\r\ndistrict reached Yüan Shu, he sent promises of valuable presents to Lü\r\nto induce him to join in a further attack on Liu Pei. The presents are\r\nsaid to have been fifty thousand measures of grain, five hundred\r\nhorses, ten thousand taels of gold and silver and a thousand pieces of\r\ncoloured silk. Lü Pu swallowed the bait and ordered Kao Shun to lead\r\nforth five legions. But Liu Pei heard of the threatened attack, so he\r\nmade inclement weather an excuse to disband his few soldiers and left\r\nHsüi, before the attacking force came up.\r\n\r\nHowever, Kao Shun demanded the promised reward through Chi Ling, who\r\nput him off saying, “My lord has gone away, I will settle this as soon\r\nas I can see him and get his decision.”\r\n\r\nWith this answer Kao Shun returned to Lü Pu, who could not decide what\r\nto do. Then came a letter from Yüan Shu saying that although Kao Shun\r\nhad gone to attack Liu Pei, yet Pei had not been destroyed and no\r\nreward could be given till he was actually taken. Lü Pu railed at what\r\nhe called the breach of faith and was inclined to attack Yüan Shu\r\nhimself. However, his adviser opposed this course, saying, “You should\r\nnot; he is in possession of Shouchʻun and has a large army, well\r\nsupplied. You are no match for him. Rather ask Liu Pei to take up his\r\nquarters at Hsiaopʻei as one of your wings and, when the time comes,\r\nlet him lead the attack. Then both the Yüans will fall before you and\r\nyou will be very powerful.”\r\n\r\nFinding this advice good he sent letters to Yüan-tê asking him to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe story of Liu Pei’s attack on Kuangling, the attack on his camp and\r\nhis losses, has been told. On his way back he met the messenger from Lü\r\nPu, who presented the letter. Yüan-tê was quite content with the offer\r\nbut his brothers were not inclined to trust Lü.\r\n\r\n“Since he treats me kindly, I cannot but trust him,” replied Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSo he went back to Hsüchou. Lü Pu, fearing that Liu Pei might doubt his\r\nsincerity, restored his family and when the ladies, Kan and Mi, saw\r\ntheir lord they told him that they had been kindly treated and guarded\r\nby soldiers against any intrusion, and provisions had never been\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n“I knew he would not harm my family,” said Yüan-tê to Kuan and Chang.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were not pleased and would not accompany their brother\r\ninto the city when he went to express his thanks. They went to escort\r\nthe two ladies to Hsiaopʻei.\r\n\r\nAt the interview Lü Pu said, “I did not wish to take the city, but your\r\nbrother behaved very badly, drinking and flogging the soldiers, and I\r\ncame to guard it lest some evil should befall.”\r\n\r\n“But I had long wished to yield it to you,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nThereupon Lü Pu pretended to wish to retire in favour of Yüan-tê who,\r\nhowever, would not hear of it. He returned and took up his quarters in\r\nHsiaopʻei, but his two brothers would not take the situation kindly and\r\nwere very discontented.\r\n\r\nSaid Yüan-tê, “One must bow to one’s lot. It is the will of Heaven and\r\none cannot struggle against fate.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu sent presents of food and stuffs and peace reigned between the\r\ntwo houses.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need to write of this. As the story runs, Yüan Shu\r\nprepared a great banquet for his soldiers on the occasion of a victory\r\ngained by Sun Tsʻê over Lu Kʻang, the Prefect of Luchiang. Yüan Shu\r\nsummoned the victor, who made obeisance at the foot of the hall of\r\naudience. Shu, sitting in State, asked for details of the campaign and\r\nthen invited Sun Tsʻê to the banquet.\r\n\r\nAfter the unhappy death of his father Sun Tsʻê had returned to\r\nChiangnan, where he had devoted himself to peaceful ends, inviting to\r\nhis side good men and able scholars. Afterwards when a quarrel broke\r\nout between his mother’s uncle, the Prefect of Tanyang, and Tʻao\r\nChʻien, he removed his mother with all the family to Chʻüa, he himself\r\ntaking service under Yüan Shu, who admired and loved him greatly.\r\n\r\n“If I had a son like him,” said Shu, “I should die without regret.”\r\n\r\nHe employed Sun Tsʻê as a soldier and sent him on various expeditions,\r\nall of which were successful. After this banquet to celebrate the\r\nvictory over Lu Kʻang, Sun Tsʻê returned to his camp very bitter over\r\nthe arrogant and patronising airs of his patron. Instead of retiring to\r\nhis tent he walked up and down by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n“Here am I, a mere nobody and yet my father was such a hero!” And he\r\ncried out and wept in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly appeared one who said, laughing loudly, “What is this, O\r\nPo-fu? While your noble father enjoyed the light of the sun he made\r\nfree use of me and if his son has any difficulty to resolve why does he\r\nnot refer it to me also instead of weeping here alone?”\r\n\r\nLooking at the speaker Sun Tsʻê saw it was one Chu Chih, whose less\r\nformal name was Chün-li, a native of that district, who had been in his\r\nfather’s service. Sun Tsʻê then ceased weeping and they two sat down.\r\n\r\n“I was weeping from regret at being unable to continue my father’s\r\nwork,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Why stay here bound to the service of a master? Why not get command of\r\nan army under the pretence of an expedition to relieve Chiangtung? Then\r\nyou can accomplish great things.”\r\n\r\nWhile these two were talking another man suddenly entered saying, “I\r\nknow what you two are planning, noble Sirs. Under my hand is a band of\r\nbold fellows ready to help Po-fu in whatever he wishes to do.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was one of Yüan Shu’s advisers named Lü Fan. They three\r\nthen sat and discussed schemes.\r\n\r\n“The one fear is that the soldiers will be refused,” said the newcomer.\r\n\r\n“I still have the Imperial Seal that my father left me; that should be\r\ngood security.”\r\n\r\n“Yüan Shu earnestly desires that jewel,” said Chu Chih. “He will\r\ncertainly lend you men on that pledge.”\r\n\r\nThe three talked over their plans, gradually settling the details, and\r\nnot many days after Sun Tsʻê obtained an interview with his patron.\r\nAssuming the appearance of deep grief he said, “I have been unable to\r\navenge my father. Now the Prefect of Yangchow is opposing my mother’s\r\nbrother and my mother and her family are in danger. Wherefore I would\r\nborrow a few companies of fighting men to rescue them. As perhaps,\r\nIllustrious Sir, you may lack confidence in me I am willing to deposit\r\nthe Imperial Seal, left me by my late father, as a pledge.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see it, if you have it,” said Shu. “I do not want the jewel\r\nreally, but you may as well leave it with me. I will lend you three\r\ncompanies and five hundred horses. Return as soon as peace can be made.\r\nAs your rank is hardly sufficient for such powers I will memorialise to\r\nobtain for you higher rank with the title of General, ‘Exterminator of\r\nBrigands,’ and you can soon start.”\r\n\r\nTsʻê thanked his patron most humbly and soon put the army in motion,\r\ntaking with him his two new friends as well as his former captains.\r\nWhen he reached Liyang he saw a body of troops in front of him, at\r\ntheir head a dashing leader of handsome and refined mien. As soon as\r\nthis man saw Sun Tsʻê he dismounted and made obeisance. It was Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nWhen Sun Chien was opposing the tyrant Minister Tung Cho, the Chou\r\nfamily had removed to Shu, in modern Anhui, and as Chou Yü and Sun Tsʻê\r\nwere of the same age all but two months, they became exceedingly good\r\nfriends and sworn brothers, Tsʻê being the “elder” in virtue of his two\r\nmonths’ seniority. Chou Yü was on his way to visit Sun Tsʻê’s uncle,\r\nPrefect of Tanyang, when the happy meeting took place.\r\n\r\nNaturally Sun Tsʻê confided his projects and inmost ideas to his\r\nfriend, who at once promised fidelity and service. They would work out\r\nthe grand design together.\r\n\r\n“Now that you have come the design is as good as accomplished,” said\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nChou Yü was introduced to Chu Chih and Lü Fan.\r\n\r\nChou Yü said, “Do you know of the two Changs of Chiangtung? They would\r\nbe most useful men in working out your schemes.”\r\n\r\n“Who are they, the two Changs?” said Sun.\r\n\r\n“They are men of transcendent genius who are living near here for the\r\nsake of tranquillity in these troublous times. Their names are Chang\r\nChao and Chang Hung. Why not invite them to help you, brother?”\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê lost no time in sending letters and gifts, but they both\r\ndeclined. Then he visited them in person, was greatly pleased with\r\ntheir speech and by dint of large gifts and much persuasion, got them\r\nto promise to join him. They were given substantial offices.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the attack upon Yangchou was the next matter for\r\ndiscussion. The Prefect, Liu Yu, was of Tunglai, a scion of the\r\nImperial family and brother of the governor of Yenchow. He had long\r\nruled in Yangchou, but Yüan Shu had forced him to leave his usual\r\nabiding city and retire to Chʻüa.\r\n\r\nHearing of the meditated attack on him he summoned his captains to take\r\ncounsel. Said Chang Ying, “I will take an army and entrench at Niuchu.\r\nNo army can get past that, whatever its strength.”\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by another who shouted, “And let me lead the van!”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned to this man; is was Tʻaishih Tzŭ who, after raising the\r\nsiege of Pohai, had come on a visit to the Prefect and stayed on.\r\n\r\nHearing him offer to undertake the hazardous post of van-leader Liu Yu\r\nsaid, “But you are still young and not yet equal to such a charge.\r\nRather stay by my side and obey my orders.”\r\n\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ withdrew in high dudgeon. Soon Chang Ying led his army to\r\nNiuchu, leaving his stores of grain at Tiko. When Sun Tsʻê approached,\r\nChang Ying went to meet him and the two armies faced each other above\r\nNiuchutʻan, (Bullock Island Rapid). Chang Ying roundly abused his\r\nopponent and Huang Kai rode out to attack, but before the combat had\r\nproceeded far there arose an alarm of fire in Chang Ying’s camp. Chang\r\nYing turned back and then Sun Tsʻê advanced in full force, compelling\r\nthe enemy to abandon their possession. The defeated general fled to the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nNow the incendiaries who had brought about this result were two, named\r\nChiang Chʻin and Chou Tʻai, both from the Kiukiang district, who in\r\nthese troublous times had got together a band of kindred spirits and\r\nlived by plundering the country along the Yangtse River. They knew Sun\r\nTsʻê by reputation as a man who treated able men very liberally and\r\nwished to join him. So they came with their band, three hundred strong,\r\nand helped him in this way as an introduction. Sun Tsʻê welcomed them\r\nand gave the leaders rank. After taking possession of the stores of all\r\nkinds abandoned by the runaways, and enlisting a large number of those\r\nwho surrendered into his own ranks, he moved forward to attack\r\nShêntʻing.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat Chang Ying returned to his master and told his\r\nmisfortune. Liu Yu was going to punish his failure by death, but\r\nlistened to his advisers, who asked for mercy for the unfortunate man,\r\nand sent him to command the garrison in Lingling. He himself set out to\r\nmeet the invaders. He camped under the hills at Lingnan. Sun Tsʻê\r\ncamped on the opposite side of the hills.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê enquired if there was a temple to Kuang-Wu, of the Hans, in\r\nthe vicinity, and was told there was a temple on the summit of the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n“I dreamed last night that he called me so I will go and pray there,”\r\nsaid Tsʻê.\r\n\r\nHe was advised not to go as the enemy was on the other side and he\r\nmight fall into an ambush.\r\n\r\n“The spirit will help me; what need I fear?”\r\n\r\nSo he put on his armour, took his spear and mounted, taking with him\r\ntwelve of his officers as an escort. They rode up the hills,\r\ndismounted, burned incense and they all bowed in the shrine. Then Tsʻê\r\nknelt and made a vow saying, “If I, Sun Tsʻê, succeed in my task and\r\nrestore the authority of my late father then will I restore this temple\r\nand order sacrifices at the four seasons.”\r\n\r\nWhen they had remounted he said, “I am going to ride along the ridge\r\nand reconnoitre the enemy’s position.”\r\n\r\nHis followers begged him to refrain but he was obstinate and they rode\r\naway together, noting the villages below. A soldier going along a\r\nbye-road quickly reported the presence of horsemen on the ridge and Liu\r\nYu said, “It is certainly Sun Tsʻê trying to inveigle us to battle. But\r\ndo not go out.”\r\n\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ, the bold, jumped up saying, “What better chance to\r\ncapture him?”\r\n\r\nSo, without orders he armed himself and rode through the camp crying,\r\n“If there be any valiant men among you follow me!”\r\n\r\nNo one moved save a subaltern who said, “He is a valiant man and I will\r\ngo with him.” So he also went. The others only laughed at the pair.\r\n\r\nNow having seen all he wished Sun Tsʻê thought it time to return and\r\nwheeled round his horse. But when he was going over the summit some one\r\nshouted, “Stay, Sun Tsʻê!”\r\n\r\nHe turned; two horsemen were coming at full speed down the next hill.\r\nHe halted and drew up his little escort right and left, he himself with\r\nhis spear ready.\r\n\r\n“Which is Sun Tsʻê?” shouted Tʻaishih.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“I am Tʻaishih Tzŭ, of Tunglai, come to take him prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am he,” said Sun Tsʻê laughing. “Come both of you together; I\r\nam not afraid of you. If I was, I should not be Po-fu.”\r\n\r\n“You and all your crowd come on and I will not blench,” cried Tʻaishih\r\nputting his horse at a gallop and setting his spear.\r\n\r\nSun braced himself for the shock and the battle began. Fifty bouts were\r\nfought and still neither combatant had the advantage. Sun Tsʻê’s\r\nfollowers whispered to each other their admiration and amazement.\r\nTʻaishih saw that the spearmanship of his opponent showed no weak point\r\nwhereby he could gain the advantage so he decided to resort to guile.\r\nFeigning defeat he would lead Sun to pursue. Tʻaishih however did not\r\nretire along the road by which he had come, but took a path leading\r\naround the hill instead of over it. His antagonist followed, shouting,\r\n“He who retreats is no worthy son of Han!”\r\n\r\nBut Tʻaishih thought within himself, “He has twelve others at his back\r\nand I only one. If I capture him, the others will retake him. I will\r\ninveigle him into some secret spot and then try.” So flying and\r\nfighting by turns he led Sun Tsʻê, an eager pursuer, down to the plain.\r\n\r\nHere Tʻaishih suddenly wheeled about and attacked. Again they exchanged\r\nhalf a hundred bouts, without result. Then Sun made a fierce thrust\r\nwhich his opponent evaded by gripping the spear under his oxter, while\r\nTʻaishih did the same with his opponent’s spear. Neither was wounded\r\nbut each exerting his utmost strength to pull the other out of the\r\nsaddle they both came to the ground.\r\n\r\nTheir steeds galloped off they knew not whither while the two men, each\r\ndropping his spear, began a hand to hand struggle. Soon their fighting\r\nrobes were in tatters. Sun gripped the short lance that Tʻaishih\r\ncarried at his back, while Tʻaishih tore off the other’s helmet. Sun\r\ntried to stab with the short lance but Tʻaishih fended off the blow\r\nwith the helmet as a shield.\r\n\r\nThen arose a great shouting. Liu Yu had come up with a company of\r\nsoldiers. Sun seemed now in sore straits. His twelve followers came up\r\nand each combatant let go his hold. Tʻaishih quickly found another\r\nsteed, seized a spear and mounted. Sun Tsʻê, whose charger had been\r\ncaught by Chʻêng Pʻu, also mounted, and a confused battle began between\r\nthe handful of men on one side and a whole company on the other. It\r\nswayed and drifted down the hill side. However, soon Chou Yü came to\r\nthe rescue, and as evening drew on a tempest put an end to the fight.\r\nBoth sides drew off and returned to camp.\r\n\r\nNext day Sun Tsʻê led his army to the front of Liu Yu’s camp and the\r\nchallenge was accepted. The armies were drawn up. Sun hung the short\r\nlance he had seized from Tʻaishih Tzŭ at the end of his spear and waved\r\nit in front of the line of battle and ordered his soldiers to shout,\r\n“If the owner of this had not fled he would have been stabbed to\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side they hung out Sun’s helmet and the soldiers shouted\r\nback “Sun Tsʻê’s head is here already.”\r\n\r\nBoth sides thus yelled defiance at each other, one side boasting, the\r\nother bragging. Then Tʻaishih rode out challenging Sun to a duel to the\r\ndeath and Sun would have accepted, but Chʻêng Pʻu said, “My lord should\r\nnot trouble himself, I will take him,” and he rode forth.\r\n\r\n“You are no antagonist for me,” said Tʻaishih. “Tell your master to\r\ncome out.”\r\n\r\nThis incensed Chʻêng, who rode at his opponent, and they two fought\r\nmany bouts. The duel was stopped by the gongs of Liu Yu.\r\n\r\n“Why did you sound the retreat?” said Tʻaishih. “I was just going to\r\ncapture the wretch.”\r\n\r\n“Because I have just heard that Chʻüa is threatened. Chou Yü is leading\r\na force thither and a certain Chʻên Wu is in league with him to betray\r\nthe city. The loss would be irremediable. I will hasten to Moling to\r\nget the help of Hsüeh Li and Chai Jung.”\r\n\r\nThe army retired, Tʻaishih Tzŭ with it, without being pursued. On the\r\nother side Chang Chao said to Sun Tsʻê, “Chou Yü’s threatened attack is\r\nthe cause of this move; they are in no mood to fight. A night raid on\r\ntheir camp would finish them.”\r\n\r\nThe army was divided into five divisions for the night surprise and\r\nhastened toward the camp where they were victorious. Their opponents\r\nscattered in all directions. Tʻaishih alone made a determined stand and\r\nas he could not withstand a whole army he fled with a few followers to\r\nChinghsien.\r\n\r\nNow Sun Tsʻê acquired a new adherent in the person of Chʻên Wu. He was\r\na soldier of middle height, sallow of complexion and dark eye, an odd\r\nlooking man. But Sun held him in high esteem, gave him rank and put him\r\nin the van for the attack on Hsüeh Li. As van-leader he and half a\r\nscore horsemen made a dash into the enemy’s formation, where they slew\r\nhalf a hundred men. So Hsüeh Li would not fight but remained within his\r\ndefences. As Sun was attacking the city a spy came in with the news\r\nthat Liu Yu and Chai Jung had gone to attack Niuchu, which made Sun\r\nmove thither in haste. His two opponents were ready for battle.\r\n\r\n“I am here,” said Sun Tsʻê, “you had better give in.”\r\n\r\nA horseman came out from behind the two leaders to accept the\r\nchallenge. It was Yü Mi. But in the third bout Sun Tsʻê made him\r\nprisoner and carried him off to the other side.\r\n\r\nSeeing his colleague thus captured Fan Nêng rode out to the rescue and\r\ngot quite close. But just as he was going to thrust, all the soldiers\r\nshouted “There is a man behind you going to strike secretly!” At this\r\nSun Tsʻê turned and shouted so thunderously loud that Fan Nêng fell out\r\nof his saddle from mere fright. He split his skull and died. When Sun\r\nTsʻê reached his standard he threw his prisoner to the ground. And he\r\nwas also dead, crushed to death between the arm and the body of his\r\ncaptor. So in a few moments Sun Tsʻê had disposed of two enemies, one\r\ncrushed to death and one frightened to death. Thereafter Sun Tsʻê was\r\ncalled the Little Prince.\r\n\r\nAfter Liu Yu’s defeat the greater portion of his force surrendered and\r\nthe number of those put to death exceeded ten thousand. Liu Yu himself\r\nsought safety with Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nAn attack on Moling was the next move. As soon as Sun Tsʻê arrived at\r\nthe moat he summoned the commander, Hsüeh Li, to surrender. Some one\r\nlet fly a furtive arrow from the wall which wounded Sun in the left\r\nthigh so severely that he fell from his steed. Hastily his officers\r\npicked up their wounded chief and returned to the camp where the arrow\r\nwas pulled out and the wound dressed with the medicines suitable for\r\ninjuries by metals.\r\n\r\nBy Sun Tsʻê’s command the story was spread abroad that the hurt had\r\nbeen fatal and all the soldiers set up cries of lamentation. The camp\r\nwas broken up. The defender of the city made a night sortie, but fell\r\ninto a carefully prepared ambush and presently Sun himself appeared on\r\nhorseback shouting “Sun Tsʻê is here still.”\r\n\r\nHis sudden appearance created such a panic that the soldiers dropped\r\ntheir weapons and fell on their faces. Sun gave orders not to kill them\r\nbut their leaders fell, one from a spear thrust as he turned to run\r\naway, another wounded by an arrow, and the commander in chief was slain\r\nin the first rush. Thus Sun Tsʻê got possession of Moling. Having\r\ncalmed the people he sent his soldiers away to Chinghsien, where\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ was in command.\r\n\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ had assembled two companies of veterans in addition to his\r\nown troop for the purpose of avenging his master. Sun Tsʻê and Chou Yü\r\non the other hand consulted how to capture him alive. The latter’s plan\r\nwas to attack the city on three sides, leaving the east gate free for\r\nflight. Some distance off an ambush would be prepared, when their\r\nvictim, his men fatigued and horses spent, would fall an easy victim.\r\n\r\nThe latest recruits under Tʻaishih Tzŭ’s banner were mostly hillmen and\r\nunaccustomed to discipline. Beside the walls of the city were pitiably\r\nlow. One night Sun ordered one Chʻên Wu to strip off his long dress,\r\nleave his arms save a dagger, clamber up the ramparts and set fire to\r\nthe city. Seeing the flames spreading the commander made for the east\r\ngate and, as soon as he got outside, Sun Tsʻê followed in pursuit. The\r\npursuit was maintained for some thirty li when the pursuers stopped.\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ went on as long as possible, finally halting to rest in a\r\nspot surrounded by reeds. Suddenly a tremendous shouting arose.\r\nTʻaishih was just starting when tripping ropes arose all round, his\r\nhorse was thrown and he found himself a prisoner.\r\n\r\nHe was taken to camp. As soon as Sun Tsʻê heard the news he himself\r\nrode out to meet the successful man and ordered the guards to leave the\r\nprisoner, whose bonds he loosened with his own hands. Then he took off\r\nhis own embroidered robe and put it on the captive. They entered the\r\ncamp together.\r\n\r\n“I knew you were a real hero,” said Sun. “That worm of a Liu Yu had no\r\nuse for such as you and so he got beaten.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, overcome by this kindness and good treatment, then\r\nformally surrendered.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê seized his hand and said, laughing, “If you had taken me at\r\nthat fight we had near the shrine, would you have killed me?”\r\n\r\n“Who can say?” said Tʻaishih smiling.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê laughed also and they entered his tent, where the captive\r\nleader was placed in the seat of honour at a banquet.\r\n\r\nTʻaishih said, “Can you trust me so far as to let me go to muster as\r\nmany as I can of the soldiers of my late master? Under the smart of\r\nthis defeat they will turn against him and they would be a great help\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly what I most desire. I will make an agreement with you that at\r\nmidday to-morrow you will return.”\r\n\r\nTʻaishih agreed and went off. All the captains said he would never\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n“He is trustworthy and will not break his word,” said the chief.\r\n\r\nNone of the officers believed he would come back. But the next day they\r\nset up a bamboo rod in the gate of the camp and just as the shadow\r\nmarked noon Tʻaishih Tzŭ returned, bringing with him about a thousand\r\nmen. Sun Tsʻê was pleased and his officers had to confess that he had\r\nrightly judged his man.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê had now several legions and Chiangtung was his. He improved\r\nthe conditions of the people and maintained order so that his adherents\r\nand supporters daily increased. He was called Sun Lang (the Bright\r\nOne). When his army approached the people used to flee in terror, but\r\nwhen it had arrived and they saw that no one was permitted to loot and\r\nnot the least attempt was made on their houses, they rejoiced and\r\npresented the soldiers with oxen and wine, for which they were in turn\r\nduly rewarded. Gladness filled the country side. The soldiers who had\r\nfollowed Liu Yu were kindly treated. Those who wished to join Sun’s\r\narmy did so; those who preferred not to be soldiers were sent home with\r\npresents. And thus Sun Tsʻê won the respect and praise of every one in\r\nKiangnan and became very powerful.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê then settled his mother and the remainder of the family in\r\nChʻüa, setting his brother Chʻüan and Chou Tʻai over the city.\r\n\r\nThen he headed an expedition to the south to reduce the Wu districts.\r\nAt that time there was a certain Yen Pai-hu, or the White Tiger, who\r\nstyled himself Prince Tê of Eastern Wu and ruled over the Wu districts.\r\nHearing of Sun Tsʻê’s approach, the “Prince” sent his brother Yen Yü\r\nwith an army against him and they met at Fêngchʻiao.\r\n\r\nYen Yü, sword in hand, took his stand on a bridge and this was reported\r\nto Sun Tsʻê, who prepared to accept the challenge. Chang Hung tried to\r\ndissuade him saying, “Forasmuch as my lord’s fate is bound up with that\r\nof the army, he should not risk a conflict with a mere robber. I would\r\nthat you should remember your own value.”\r\n\r\n“Your words, O Elder One, are as gold and precious stones, but I fear\r\nthat my soldiers will not carry out my commands unless I myself share\r\ntheir dangers.”\r\n\r\nThen he sent forth Han Tang to take up the challenge. Just as he\r\nreached the bridge, Chiang Chʻin and Chʻên Wu, who had dropped down the\r\nriver in a small boat, passed under the bridge. Though the arrows fell\r\nin clouds on the bank, the two men rushed up and fiercely attacked Yen\r\nYü as he stood on the bridge. He fled and Han Tang went in pursuit\r\nsmiting up to the gate of the city into which he entered.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê laid siege to Soochow both by land and water. For three days\r\nno one came out to offer battle. Then at the head of his army he came\r\nto the Chʻang Gate and summoned the warden. An officer of\r\ninconsiderable rank came out and stood with one hand resting on a beam\r\nwhile with the other he gave point to his abuse of those below. Quickly\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ’s hands sought his bow and an arrow was on the string.\r\n\r\n“See me hit that fellow’s hand,” said he, turning to his companions.\r\n\r\nEven as the sound of his voice died away, the bowstring twanged, the\r\narrow sped and lodged in the beam, firmly pinning thereto the officer’s\r\nhand. Both sides, those on the wall and those below it, marvelled at\r\nsuch marksmanship.\r\n\r\nThe wounded man was taken away and when the White Tiger heard of the\r\nexploit he said, “How can we hope to withstand an army with such men as\r\nthis in it?”\r\n\r\nAnd his thoughts turned toward a peace. He sent his brother Yü out to\r\nsee Sun Tsʻê, who received him civilly, invited him into the tent and\r\nset wine before him.\r\n\r\n“And what does your brother propose?” said Sun.\r\n\r\n“He is willing to share this district with you,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“The rat! how dare he put himself on a level with me?” cried Sun.\r\n\r\nHe commanded to put the messenger to death. Yü started up and drew his\r\nsword, but out flew Sun Tsʻê’s blade and the unhappy messenger fell to\r\nthe ground. His head was hacked off and sent into the city to his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThis had its effect. The White Tiger saw resistance was hopeless, so he\r\nabandoned the city and fled. Sun Tsʻê pressed the attack. Huang Kai\r\ncaptured Chiahsing (Kashing) and Tʻaishih Tzŭ took Wuchʻêng. The\r\ndistrict was quickly subdued. The White Tiger rushed off toward\r\nHangchow in the east, plundering on all sides, till a band of villagers\r\nunder the leadership of one Ling Tsʻao checked his career of robbery\r\nthere. He then went toward Kueichi.\r\n\r\nThe Lings, father and son, then went to meet Sun Tsʻê, who took them\r\ninto his service as a reward for their service and the joint forces\r\ncrossed the river.\r\n\r\nThe White Tiger gathered his scattered forces and took up a position at\r\nthe western ford, but Chʻêng Pʻu attacked him there and scattered the\r\ndefenders, chasing them as far as Huichi. The Prefect of the place,\r\nWang Lang, was on their side and inclined to support them actively.\r\nBut, when he proposed this, one of his men stood forth saying, “No! No!\r\nSun Tsʻê as a leader is humane and upright, while the White Tiger is a\r\nsavage ruffian. Rather capture him and offer his person as a peace\r\noffering to Sun Tsʻê.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect turned angrily toward the speaker, who was an official\r\nnamed Yü Fan, and bade him be silent. He withdrew sighing deeply. And\r\nthe Prefect went to the help of the White Tiger with whom he joined\r\nforces at Shanyin.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê came up. When both sides were arrayed Sun Tsʻê rode out and\r\naddressed Wang Lang, saying, “Mine is an army of good men and my aim is\r\nto restore peace to Chekiang, but you give your support to a rebel!”\r\n\r\nWang Lang replied, “Your greed is insatiable. Having got possession of\r\nWu you want also my district, and so as an excuse you have vengeance to\r\nwreak on the Yens.”\r\n\r\nThis response greatly angered Sun Tsʻê. Just as battle was to be joined\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ advanced and Wang Lang came toward him waving his sword.\r\nBefore they had exchanged many passes Chou Hsin dashed out to help\r\nWang. Thereupon Huang Kai rode out to make the sides more equal. These\r\nlatter two were just engaging when the drums rolled on both sides and a\r\ngeneral battle began.\r\n\r\nSuddenly confusion was caused in the rear of Wang’s army by the sudden\r\nonslaught of a small troop. Wang Lang galloped off to see to it. Then\r\nan attack was made on his flank, so that he was in a hopeless position,\r\nand he and the White Tiger, fighting desperately, only just managed to\r\nreach the shelter of the city. The drawbridges were raised, the gates\r\nclosed and preparations made to sustain a siege.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê followed right up to the walls and then divided his men so as\r\nto attack all four gates. Seeing that the city was being fiercely\r\nattacked Wang Lang was for making a sortie, but the White Tiger opposed\r\nthis as hopeless against so strong a force outside. They could only\r\nstrengthen their position and remain behind the shelter of the ramparts\r\nuntil hunger forced the besiegers to retire. Wang Lang agreed and the\r\nsiege went on.\r\n\r\nFor several days a vigorous attack was maintained, but with little\r\nsuccess. Taking counsel with his officers Sun Ching, who was the uncle\r\nof Sun Tsʻê, said, “Since they are holding the city with such\r\nresolution it will be difficult to dislodge them. But the bulk of their\r\nsupplies is stored at Chʻatu, distant only some score li. Our best plan\r\nis to seize this place, thus attacking where the enemy is unprepared,\r\nand doing what they do not expect.”\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê approved saying, “My uncle’s plan is admirable and will crush\r\nthe rebels.” So he issued orders to kindle watch fires at all the\r\ngates, and leave the flags standing to maintain the appearance of\r\nsoldiers in position while the expedition went south.\r\n\r\nChou Yü came to utter a warning, “When you, my lord, go away the\r\nbesieged will surely come out and follow you. We might prepare a\r\nsurprise for them.”\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê replied, “My preparations are complete and the city will be\r\ncaptured to-night.”\r\n\r\nSo the army set out.\r\n\r\nWang Lang heard that the besiegers had gone and he went up to the tower\r\nto reconnoitre. He saw the fires blazing, the smoke rising, and the\r\npennons fluttering in the breeze as usual and hesitated.\r\n\r\nChou Hsin said, “He has gone and this is only a stratagem. Let us go\r\nout and smite them.”\r\n\r\nThe White Tiger said, “If he has gone, it is to attack Chʻatu. Let us\r\npursue.”\r\n\r\n“The place is our base of supply,” said Wang Lang, “and must be\r\ndefended. You lead the way and I will follow with reserves.”\r\n\r\nSo the White Tiger and Chou Hsin went forth with five companies and\r\ndrew near their enemy about the first watch, at twenty li from the\r\ncity. The road led through dense forest. Then suddenly the drums beat\r\nand lighted torches sprang up on all sides. The White Tiger was\r\nfrightened, turned his horse and started to retreat. At once a leader\r\nappeared in front in whom, by the glare of the torches, he recognised\r\nSun Tsʻê. Chou Hsin made a rush at him but fell under Sun Tsʻê’s spear.\r\nThe men surrendered. However, the White Tiger managed to cut his way\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWang Lang soon heard of the loss and not daring to return to the city\r\nretreated in all haste to Haiyü. And so Sun Tsʻê got possession of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nHaving restored order, a few days later a man came bringing the head of\r\nthe White Tiger as an offering to Sun Tsʻê. This man was a native of\r\nthe district. He was of medium height, with a square face and wide\r\nmouth. He was named Tung Hsi, and was given an office. After this peace\r\nreigned in all the east and, having placed his uncle in command of the\r\ncity and made Chu Chih Prefect, Sun Tsʻê returned to his own place.\r\n\r\nWhile Sun Tsʻê was absent a band of brigands suddenly attacked\r\nHsüanchʻêng, left in the care of his brother Chʻüan and the leader Chou\r\nTʻai. As the onslaught was made on all sides at once, and in the night,\r\nthe brigands got the upper hand. Chou Tʻai took the youth in his arms\r\nand mounted a horse, but as the robbers came on with swords to attack\r\nhim he dismounted, and though without mail, met the robbers on foot and\r\nslew them as they came up. Then came a horseman armed with a spear, but\r\nChou Tʻai laid hold of his spear and pulled him to the earth. Then he\r\nmounted the robber’s horse and thrusting this way and that with the\r\nspear fought his way out. So Sun Chʻüan was preserved, but his saviour\r\nhad received more than a dozen wounds.\r\n\r\nThese wounds being due to metal would not heal but swelled enormously,\r\nand the brave soldier’s life hung in the balance. Sun Tsʻê was deeply\r\ngrieved. Then Tung Hsi said, “Once in an engagement with some pirates I\r\nreceived many spear wounds, but a certain wise man named Yü Fan\r\nrecommended a surgeon who cured me in half a month.”\r\n\r\n“Surely this must be Yü Chung-hsiang,” replied Sun Tsʻê.\r\n\r\n“That is he; he is so called.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, truly a wise man; I will employ him.”\r\n\r\nSo Sun Tsʻê sent two officers to invite him and he came at once. He was\r\ntreated in most friendly fashion and appointed an official forthwith.\r\nThen the question of treating the wounded man was brought up.\r\n\r\n“The surgeon is one Hua Tʻo, who has perfectly marvellous skill in the\r\nleech’s art. I will get him to come,” said Yü Fan.\r\n\r\nShortly the famous leech arrived, a man with the complexion of a youth\r\nand a snowy beard. He looked more like a saint who had passed the gates\r\nof this life. He was treated very handsomely and taken to see the sick\r\nsoldier’s wounds.\r\n\r\n“The case is not difficult,” said the surgeon and he prepared certain\r\ndrugs that healed the wounds within a month. Sun Tsʻê suitably\r\nacknowledged his care and skill and he was allowed to leave.\r\n\r\nNext Sun Tsʻê attacked the brigands and destroyed them, so restoring\r\ncomplete tranquillity to Chiangnan. After this he set garrisons at all\r\nthe strategical points, and this done, memorialised what he had\r\nachieved. He came to an understanding with Tsʻao Tsʻao and sent letters\r\nto Yüan Shu demanding the return of the Seal he had left in pledge.\r\n\r\nBut Yüan Shu, secretly cherishing the most ambitious designs, wrote\r\nexcuses and did not return the State jewel. In his own place he hastily\r\nsummoned his officers to a council and said, “Sun Tsʻê borrowed an army\r\nfrom me and set out on an expedition which has made him master of\r\nChiangtung. Now he says nothing of repayment but demands the token of\r\nhis pledge. Truly he is a boor and what steps can I take to destroy\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nThe Recorder, Yang Ta-chiang, replied, “You cannot do any thing against\r\nhim for he is too strongly placed. You must first remove Liu Pei in\r\nrevenge for having attacked you without cause, and then you may think\r\nabout Sun Tsʻê. I have a scheme to put the former into your hands in a\r\nvery short time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        He went not to destroy the tiger, but instead\r\n        Against a dragon forth his army led.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe means he employed will be made plain in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA FEAT OF ARCHERY:\r\nA BATTLE LOST AT YUSHUI RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is your plan of attack on Liu Pei?” said Shu.\r\n\r\nYang Ta-chiang replied, “Though Liu Pei, now camped at Hsiaopʻei, could\r\neasily be taken, yet Lü Pu is strongly posted at the chief city near,\r\nand I think he would help Pei if it was only for the grudge he bears\r\nagainst you for not having given him the gold and stuffs, grain and\r\nhorses you promised. First of all you should send Lü Pu a present\r\nwhereby to engage his affections and keep him quiet while you deal with\r\nLiu Pei. You can see to Lü Pu after this is done.”\r\n\r\nThereupon a large quantity of millet was sent, with letters, by the\r\nhand of Han Yin. The gift pleased Lü Pu greatly; and he treated the\r\nmessenger with great cordiality. Feeling sure of no trouble from that\r\nquarter Yüan Shu told off the leaders of the expedition against\r\nHsiaopʻei.\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei heard these things he called his officers to take counsel.\r\nChang Fei was for open war forthwith. Sun Chʻien said their resources\r\nwere too small: they must lay the position before Lü Pu and ask help.\r\n\r\n“Do you think that fellow will do anything?” said Chang Fei cynically.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei decided in favour of Sun’s proposal and wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Humbly I venture to remind you that I am here by your orders and enjoy\r\nrepose as the result of your kindness, extensive as the heavens. Now\r\nYüan Shu, moved by a desire for revenge, is sending a force against\r\nthis place and its destruction is imminent unless you intervene to save\r\nit. I trust you will send an army quickly to protect the town, and our\r\nhappiness will be inexpressible.”\r\n\r\nReceiving this Lü Pu called in Chʻên Kung to whom he said, “I have just\r\nreceived gifts from Yüan Shu and a letter, with the intent of\r\nrestraining me from helping Liu Pei. Now comes a letter from him asking\r\nhelp. It seems to me that Yüan-tê where he is can do me no harm, but if\r\nYüan Shu overcomes Liu Pei then the power of the north is so much\r\nnearer and I should be unable to resist the attacks of so many leaders\r\nand should never sleep secure. I will aid Liu Pei; that is the better\r\ncourse for me.”\r\n\r\nNow the force sent against Hsiaopʻei went thither as quickly as\r\npossible and soon the country to the southeast fluttered with pennons\r\nby day and blazed with watch fires by night, while the rolling of the\r\ndrums reverberated from heaven to earth.\r\n\r\nThe few men at Liu Pei’s disposal were led out of the city and arranged\r\nto make a brave show, but it was good news to him to hear that Lü Pu\r\nhad arrived and was quite near. He camped only a li away to the\r\nsouth-west. When Yüan Shu’s general, Chi Ling, heard of his arrival he\r\nwrote letters reproaching Lü Pu for his treachery. Lü Pu smiled as he\r\nread them.\r\n\r\n“I know how to make both of them love me,” said he. So he sent\r\ninvitations to both leaders to come to a banquet. Liu Pei was for\r\naccepting the invitation and going, but his brothers dissuaded him\r\nsaying, “There is some treachery in his heart.”\r\n\r\n“I have treated him too well for him to do me any harm,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSo he mounted and rode away, the two brothers following. They came to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nThe host said, “Now by a special effort I have got you out of danger; I\r\nhope you will not forget that when you come into your own.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê thanked him heartily and was invited to take a seat. The two\r\nbrothers took up their usual place as guards.\r\n\r\nBut when Chi Ling was announced Yüan-tê felt a spasm of fear and got up\r\nto go away.\r\n\r\n“You two are invited for the particular purpose of a discussion,” said\r\nthe host. “Do not take it amiss.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê, being quite ignorant of his intentions, was very uneasy.\r\nPresently his fellow guest entered. Seeing Yüan-tê in the tent, and in\r\nthe seat of honour, he was puzzled, hesitated and tried to withdraw.\r\nBut the attendants prevented this and Lü Pu, advancing, laid hold of\r\nhim and drew him into the tent as he had been a child.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to slay me?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” replied Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“Then you are going to slay Long-ears?”\r\n\r\n“No; not that.”\r\n\r\n“Then what does it mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yüan-tê and I are brothers. Now, General, you are besieging him and so\r\nI have come to the rescue.”\r\n\r\n“Then slay me,” said Chi Ling.\r\n\r\n“There would be no sense in that. All my life I have disliked fighting\r\nand quarrels, but have loved making peace. And now I want to settle the\r\nquarrel between you two.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask how you think of doing so?”\r\n\r\n“I have a means and one approved of heaven itself.”\r\n\r\nThen he drew Ling within the tent and led him up to Pei. The two men\r\nfaced each other, full of mutual suspicion, but their host placed\r\nhimself between them and they took their seats, Liu Pei on the right\r\nhand of the host.\r\n\r\nThe banquet began. After a number of courses almost in silence, Lü Pu\r\nspoke, saying, “I wish you two gentlemen to listen to me and put an end\r\nto your strife.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei made no reply but Chi Ling said, “I have come with an army of\r\nten legions at the express bidding of my master to take Liu Pei. How\r\ncan I cease the strife? I must fight.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Chang Fei drawing his sword. “Few as we are we regard\r\nyou no more than a lot of children. What are you compared with a\r\nmillion Yellow Turbans? You dare to hurt our brother!”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü urged him to be silent. “Let us see what General Lü has to say\r\nfirst; after that there will be time to go to our tents and fight.”\r\n\r\n“I beg you both to come to an understanding. I cannot let you fight,”\r\nsaid Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nNow on one side Chi Ling was discontented and angry; on the other Chang\r\nFei was dying for a fight and neither of the two chiefly concerned\r\nwould signify assent. Then suddenly the host turned to his attendants\r\nsaying, “Bring my halberd!” They did so and he sat there gripping the\r\ngraceful but effective weapon in his right hand. Both guests felt very\r\nill at ease and turned pale. Lü Pu went on, “I have tried to persuade\r\nyou to make peace for that is the command of the Most High. It shall be\r\nput to the test.”\r\n\r\nHe then bade his servants take the halberd outside beyond the gate and\r\nset it up. Then speaking to his two guests he said, “That gate is one\r\nhundred and fifty paces distant. If I can hit that centre branch of the\r\nhalberd-head with an arrow, you will both withdraw your armies. If I\r\nmiss, you can go away and prepare for immediate battle. I shall compel\r\nyou to abide by what I say.”\r\n\r\nChi Ling thought to himself, “That small mark at that distance! How\r\ncould any one hit it?” So he assented, thinking he would have plenty of\r\nfighting after his host had missed the mark. Of course Liu Pei was\r\nwilling.\r\n\r\nThey all sat down again and wine was served. When this had been drunk\r\nthe host called for his bow and arrows. Yüan-tê silently prayed that he\r\nwould hit the mark.\r\n\r\nLü Pu turned back his sleeves, carefully fitted an arrow to the string\r\nand pulled the bow to its utmost stretch. A slight exclamation escaped\r\nhim as the bow curved like the harvest moon sailing through the sky.\r\n“Twang!” went the bowstring and the arrow sped like a falling star. And\r\nit struck the slender tongue of the halberd head full and square. A\r\nroar of acclamation from all sides greeted the exploit.\r\n\r\n\r\n        O Lü was a wonderful archer,\r\n            And the arrow he shot sped straight;\r\n        By hitting the mark he saved his friend\r\n            That day at his yamên gate.\r\n        Hou I, the archer of ancient days,\r\n            Brought down each mocking sun,\r\n        And the apes that gibbered to fright Yuchi\r\n            Were slain by him, one by one.\r\n        But we sing of Lü Pu that drew the bow,\r\n            And his feathered shaft that flew;\r\n        For a myriad men could doff their mail\r\n            When he hit the mark so true.\r\n\r\n\r\nLü Pu laughed loud at the success of his shot. Dropping his bow he\r\nseized his guests by the hands saying, “The command of Heaven indeed!\r\nAnd now you cease from fighting!”\r\n\r\nHe ordered the soldier attendants to pour out great goblets of wine and\r\neach drank. Liu Pei in his inmost heart felt rather ashamed; his fellow\r\nguest sat silent, nodding his head. Presently he said, “I cannot\r\ndisobey your command, General, but let me depart. What will my master\r\nsay and will he believe me?”\r\n\r\n“I will write a letter and confirm it,” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more rounds of the wine Chi Ling asked that he might have\r\nthe letter and after that departed. When the brothers took their leave\r\nLü Pu again reminded Liu Pei that he owed him his deliverance.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the soldiers had gone. Here nothing will be said of the\r\nentry of two of the actors in the drama into their own towns. When Chi\r\nLing had got back to Huainan and told the story of the feat of archery\r\nand the peace-making that followed, and had presented the letter, his\r\nlord was very wroth.\r\n\r\n“He repays me for all my grain with this bit of play-acting!” cried he.\r\n“He has saved Liu Pei, but I will lead a large army myself and settle\r\nhim, and take Lü Pu too.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful, my lord,” said Chi Ling. “He is braver and stronger than\r\nmost men and has wide territory. He and Liu Pei together make a\r\npowerful combination, not easy to break. But there is another course. I\r\nhave found out that his wife, the lady Yen, has a daughter just of\r\nmarriageable age and as you have a son, you could arrange a marriage\r\nalliance with Lü Pu. If his daughter wedded your son he would certainly\r\nslay your enemy for you. This is the nothing-can-separate-relations\r\nplan.”\r\n\r\nThis scheme appealed to Yüan Shu, who soon set about its\r\naccomplishment. He sent presents by the hand of Han Yin, who was to\r\ndiscuss the question. When Han saw Lü he spoke of the immense respect\r\nhis master had for him and his desire to ensure perpetual alliance\r\nbetween the two families by a marriage, an alliance such as existed\r\nbetween the states Tsʻin and Chin.\r\n\r\nLü Pu was well disposed toward the scheme, but went in to consult his\r\nwife. Now Lü Pu had two wives and one concubine. He first married a\r\nlady of the Yen family and she was the legal wife. Then he took Little\r\nCicada as a concubine, and while he was living at Hsiaopʻei he had\r\nmarried a secondary wife, a daughter of Tsʻao Pao. She had died quite\r\nyoung leaving no issue. Neither had his concubine borne any children.\r\nSo that he had but one child, this daughter, of whom he was dotingly\r\nfond.\r\n\r\nWhen he broached the subject his wife said, “The Yüan’s have dominated\r\ntheir part of the country these many years. They have a large army and\r\nare very prosperous. One day a Yüan will become Emperor and our\r\ndaughter may hope to be an Empress. But how many sons has he?”\r\n\r\n“Only this one.”\r\n\r\n“Then we should accept the offer. Even if our daughter does not become\r\nan Empress, Hsüchou is nothing to be sad about.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu decided to accept and so treated the messenger with extreme\r\ngenerosity. Han Yin went back with a favourable answer. The wedding\r\ngifts were then prepared ready for Han Yin to take to the bride’s\r\nfamily. They were received and banquets and merry-making filled all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOne day Chʻên Kung went to see the messenger in his lodging, and when\r\nthe usual ceremonies and greetings had been exchanged, the two men sat\r\ndown to talk. When the servants had been sent out of earshot Chʻên Kung\r\nsaid, “Who originated this scheme by which Yüan Shu and Lü Pu are to\r\nbecome connections by this marriage so that Liu Pei’s head may fall?”\r\n\r\nHan Yin was terrified. “I pray you not to let it get abroad,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I certainly shall keep it secret. But if there be any delay some other\r\nperson will find it out and that spells failure.”\r\n\r\n“What had best be done?”\r\n\r\n“I will see Lü Pu and get him to send the girl immediately so that the\r\nmarriage may be concluded quickly.”\r\n\r\n“If it happened thus my master would indeed hold you in high respect.”\r\n\r\nWith this Chʻên Kung took his leave and sought an interview with Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“I hear your daughter is to be married to Yüan Shu’s son. That is\r\ncapital, but no one knows when.”\r\n\r\n“That has yet to be considered.”\r\n\r\n“There were certain fixed rules as to the period between sending\r\npresents and consummation of the marriage; Emperors, a year; nobles,\r\nhalf a year; high officers, three months; and common people, one\r\nmonth.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu replied, “As to Yüan Kung-lu, Heaven has already put into his\r\nhands one Imperial jewel and he will surely arrive at the dignity one\r\nday. So, I should think the Imperial rule would apply.”\r\n\r\n“No; it will not.”\r\n\r\n“The nobles’ rule, then?”\r\n\r\n“No; nor that.”\r\n\r\n“The high officers’?”\r\n\r\n“Not even that.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu laughed. “Then you mean me to go by the rule for common people.”\r\n\r\n“Nor that either.”\r\n\r\n“Then what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“In the midst of the present troubles, when there is great rivalry\r\nbetween the nobles, do you not see that the others will be exceedingly\r\njealous of your marriage alliance with such a family as the Yüans?\r\nSuppose you postpone the choice of the day, most likely when your fine\r\nmorning arrives the wedding party will fall into an ambush on the road\r\nand the bride be carried off. Then what could be done? My opinion is\r\nthat you would have done better to refuse. But since you have\r\nconsented, then carry out the plan at once before the lords hear of it\r\nand so send the girl over without delay to Shouchʻun. You can hire a\r\nlodging there till you have selected the wedding day and the odds are\r\ngreatly against any failure.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is quite to the point,” replied Lü.\r\n\r\nHe went into the private apartments to see his wife and told her the\r\nbride elect would set out immediately and the trousseau was to be\r\nprepared as far as it could be. On his side he chose some good horses\r\nand had a wedding carriage got ready. The escort consisted of Han Yin\r\nand two military officers. The procession went out of the city to the\r\nsound of music.\r\n\r\nNow at this time Chʻên Kuei, father of Chʻên Têng (Yüan-lung) was\r\nplacidly waiting till the evening of his life passed into night.\r\nHearing this burst of music he enquired the occasion and the servants\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\n“They are working on the ‘Relatives-are-inseparable’ device, then,”\r\nsaid he. “Yüan-tê is in danger.”\r\n\r\nThereupon in spite of his many infirmities he went to see Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“Noble Sir, what brings you here?” asked Lü.\r\n\r\n“I heard you were dead and I came to mourn,” quavered the old man.\r\n\r\n“Who said that?” exclaimed his host.\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time you received grand presents from the Yüan’s that you\r\nmight slay Liu Pei, but you got out by that clever shot at your\r\nhalberd. Now they suddenly seek a marriage alliance thinking to get\r\nhold of your daughter as a pledge. The next move will be an attack on\r\nHsiaopʻei and, that gone, where are you? Whatever they ask in future,\r\ngrain or men or anything else, and you yield, will bring your own end\r\nnearer, and make you hated all round. If you refuse, then you are false\r\nto the duties of a relative and that will be an excuse to attack you\r\nopenly. Beside this Yüan Shu intends to call himself Emperor, which\r\nwould be rebellion, and you would be of the rebel’s family; something\r\nabominable, which the Empire would not suffer.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu was much disturbed to hear this. “I have been misled!” cried he.\r\n\r\nSo he hurriedly sent Chang Liao to bring the wedding party back to the\r\ncity. When they had come he threw Han Yin into prison and sent a reply\r\nto Yüan Shu saying curtly that the girl’s trousseau was not ready and\r\nshe could not be married till it was.\r\n\r\nHan Yin was sent back to the capital. Lü Pu was hesitating what course\r\nto adopt, when he heard that Liu Pei was enlisting soldiers and buying\r\nhorses for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n“He is simply doing his duty; there is nothing to be surprised at,”\r\nsaid Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nThen came two officers saying, “As you ordered us we went into Shantung\r\nto purchase horses. We had got three hundred when, on our way back, on\r\nthe borders of Peihsien some robbers stole half of them. We hear that\r\nthe real robbers were Chang Fei and his men, who took on the guise of\r\nbrigands.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu was very angry at this and began to prepare an expedition against\r\nHsiaopʻei. When Liu Pei heard that an attack threatened he led out his\r\narmy to oppose it and the two armies were arrayed. Liu Pei rode to the\r\nfront and said, “Elder brother, why have you brought an army against\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu began abusing him saying, “That shot of mine at the yamên gate\r\nsaved you from grave danger; why then did you steal my horses?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted horses and I sent out to buy them. Should I dare to take\r\nyours?” said Liu.\r\n\r\n“You stole a hundred and fifty in the person of your brother Chang Fei.\r\nYou only used another man’s hand.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Chang Fei, with his spear in rest, rode out saying, “Yes; I\r\nstole your good horses, and what more do you expect?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu replied, “You goggled-eyed thief! You are always treating me with\r\ncontempt.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I took your horses and you get angry. You did not say any thing\r\nwhen you stole my brother’s city.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu rode forward to give battle and Chang Fei advanced. A reckless\r\nfight began and the two warriors kept it up for a hundred bouts without\r\na decisive stroke. Then Liu Pei, fearing some accident to his brother,\r\nhastily beat the gongs as a signal to retire and led his army into the\r\ncity. Lü Pu then invested it.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei called his brother and chid him as the cause of all this\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\n“Where are the horses?” said he.\r\n\r\n“In some of the temples and courts,” replied Fei.\r\n\r\nA messenger was sent out to speak softly and offer to restore the\r\nstolen horses if hostilities were to cease. Lü Pu was disposed to agree\r\nbut Chʻên Kung opposed. “You will suffer by and by if you do not remove\r\nthis Liu Pei.”\r\n\r\nUnder his influence the request for peace was rejected and the attack\r\non the city pressed harder.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei called Mi Chu and Sun Chʻien to him to ask advice.\r\n\r\nSaid the latter, “The one person that Tsʻao Tsʻao detests is Lü Pu. Let\r\nus then abandon the city and take refuge with Tsʻao Tsʻao, from whom we\r\nmay borrow men to destroy him.”\r\n\r\n“If we try to get away, who will lead the van?”\r\n\r\n“I will do my best,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\nSo he led the way. Kuan Yü was rearguard and in the centre was Liu Pei\r\nwith the non-fighting portion. The cavalcade started and went out at\r\nthe north gate. They met some opposition but the soldiers were driven\r\noff and the besieging force was passed without difficulty. Chang Liao\r\npursued, but was held off by the rearguard. It seemed Lü Pu was not\r\ndissatisfied at the flight for he took no personal trouble to prevent\r\nit. He made formal entry into the city, settled local affairs and\r\nappointed a governor.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei approached Hsütu and encamped outside the city, whence he sent\r\nSun Chʻien to see Tsʻao Tsʻao and relate the events that brought him\r\nthere. Tsʻao was very friendly and said, “Liu Pei is as my brother.” He\r\ninvited him to enter the city.\r\n\r\nLeaving his brothers at the camp Liu Pei, with Sun Chʻien and Mi Chu,\r\nwent to Tsʻao Tsʻao, who received him with the greatest respect. The\r\nstory of Lü Pu’s perfidy was again related.\r\n\r\n“He has no sense of right,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. “You and I, my brother,\r\nwill attack him together.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was very grateful. A banquet was then prepared and it was late\r\nevening before the visitor left for his own camp.\r\n\r\nHsün Yü then had an interview with his master and said, “If you are not\r\non your guard Liu Pei will be your undoing. You ought to destroy him.\r\nHe is too much of the hero.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao made no reply and his adviser retired. Presently Kuo Chia came\r\nand Tsʻao Tsʻao said, “I have been advised to kill Liu Pei; what of\r\nsuch a scheme?”\r\n\r\n“A bad scheme,” said Kuo. “You are the popular champion, pledged to\r\nrelieve the people from oppression and only by truth and rectitude can\r\nyou secure the support of the noble-minded. Your only fear is lest they\r\nstay away. Now Liu Pei is famous. He has come to you for help and\r\nprotection and to put him to death would be to alienate all good men\r\nand put fear into the hearts of all the able advisers. Hampered by\r\nthese difficulties where will you find those whose help you need? To\r\nremove the dangers represented by one man and thereby injure yourself\r\nin the eyes of all mankind is a sure means of destruction. These\r\nconditions need careful consideration.”\r\n\r\n“What you say exactly fits in with what I think,” said Tsʻao, greatly\r\npleased with these remarks.\r\n\r\nHis next step was to memorialise the Emperor to give Liu Pei the\r\ngovernorship of Yüchou.\r\n\r\nAgain Chʻêng Yü said, “Liu Pei is certain to rise to the top; he will\r\nnever remain in a subordinate position. You had better remove him.”\r\n\r\n“Now is just the time to make use of good men. I will not forfeit the\r\nregard of the world for the sake of removing one individual. Kuo\r\nFêng-hsiao and I both see this in the same light.”\r\n\r\nWherefore he rejected all persuasion to work against Liu Pei but sent\r\nhim soldiers and a large supply of grain, and set him on his way to Yü\r\n(Honan). He was to march to Hsiaopʻei, occupy it, call together his\r\nformer soldiers and attack Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei reached Yüchou he sent to inform Tsʻao Tsʻao, who prepared\r\nto march an army to subjugate Lü Pu. But just then hasty news came that\r\nChang Chi, who had gone to the attack of Nanyang, had been wounded by a\r\nstray arrow and had died. His nephew Hsiu had succeeded to the command\r\nof his army and with Chia Hsü as strategist, had joined Liu Piao and\r\ncamped at Wanchʻêng. They intended to attack the capital and get\r\npossession of the Emperor’s person.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was placed in a quandary. He would go to attack this\r\ncombination but he feared lest Lü Pu would attack the capital if he\r\nleft it. So he sought the advice of Hsün Yü.\r\n\r\n“Lü Pu has no notion of a policy. He is led astray by any little\r\nadvantage that presents itself to his eyes. All you need do is to\r\nobtain promotion for him, giving him some additional title, and tell\r\nhim to make peace with Yüan-tê and he will do it.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao and he acted upon the hint and sent an officer\r\nwith the official announcement and a letter urging peace, while he went\r\non with preparations to meet the other danger. When ready he marched\r\nout in three divisions. Hsiahou Tun was the van-leader and they went to\r\nYüshui River and camped there.\r\n\r\nChia Hsü succeeded in persuading Chang Hsiu of the hopelessness of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n“You would do well to surrender since his army is too large for you to\r\noppose,” said he.\r\n\r\nSeeing the truth of this Hsiu sent his adviser to propose submission.\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was greatly pleased with the messenger, admiring his ready\r\nand fluent repartee, and tried to win him to his service.\r\n\r\n“I was formerly with Li Tsʻui and was held guilty with him. Now I am\r\nwith Chang who accepts my advice and I should not like to abandon him,”\r\nsaid Chia Hsü.\r\n\r\nHe left and next day conducted his master into Tsʻao Tsʻao’s presence.\r\nTsʻao was generous. Then he entered Wanchʻêng, the greater part of the\r\narmy being put in camp outside where the lines extended some ten li.\r\nGreat banquets were given every day and Tsʻao Tsʻao was always being\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Tsʻao Tsʻao returned to his quarters in a more than usual\r\nmerry mood, he asked the attendants if there were any singing girls in\r\nthe city. The son of his elder brother heard the question and said,\r\n“Peeping through one of the partitions last evening I saw a perfectly\r\nbeautiful woman in one of the courts. They told me she was the wife of\r\nChang Hsiu’s uncle. She is very lovely.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao, inflamed by the description given him of the beauty, told\r\nhis nephew to go and bring her to visit him. He did so supported by an\r\narmed escort and very soon the woman stood before him.\r\n\r\nShe was a beauty indeed and Tsʻao Tsʻao asked her name. She replied,\r\n“Thy handmaid was wife to Chang Chi; I was born of the Tsou family.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know who I am?”\r\n\r\n“I have known the Minister by reputation a long time. I am happy to see\r\nhim and be permitted to bow before him,” said she.\r\n\r\n“It was for your sake that I allowed Chang Hsiu to submit; otherwise I\r\nwould have slain him and cut him off root and branch,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, then, I owe my very life to you; I am very grateful,” said\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n“To see you is a glimpse of paradise, but there is one thing I should\r\nlike better. Stay here and go with me to the capital where I will see\r\nthat you are properly cared for. What do you say to that?”\r\n\r\nShe could but thank him.\r\n\r\n“But Chang Hsiu will greatly wonder at my prolonged absence and gossips\r\nwill begin to talk,” said she.\r\n\r\n“If you like you can leave the city to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nShe did so, but instead of going at once to the capital she stayed with\r\nhim among the tents, where Tien Wei was appointed as a special guard\r\nover her apartments. Tsʻao was the only person whom she saw and he\r\npassed the days in idle dalliance with the lady, quite content to let\r\ntime flow by.\r\n\r\nBut Chang’s people told him what had gone amiss and he was angry at the\r\nshame brought upon the family. He confided his trouble to Chia Hsü who\r\nsaid, “Keep this secret, wait till he appears again to carry on\r\nbusiness and then....”\r\n\r\nA plan was arranged quite secretly.\r\n\r\nNot long after this Chang Hsiu went into Tsʻao Tsʻao’s tent to say\r\nthat, as many of his men were deserting, it would be well to camp them\r\nin the centre and when permission was given the men of his old command\r\nwere moved in and placed in four camps.\r\n\r\nBut Tien Wei, the especial guard of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s tent, was a man to be\r\nfeared, being both brave and powerful. It was hard to know how to\r\nattack him. So counsel was taken with an officer, Hu Chʻêrh, a man of\r\nenormous strength and activity. He could carry a burden of six hundred\r\npounds and travel seven hundred li in a day. He proposed a plan. He\r\nsaid, “The fearsome thing about Tien Wei is his double halberd. But get\r\nhim to come to a party and make him quite drunk before you send him\r\nback. I will mingle among his escort and so get into his tent and steal\r\naway his weapon. One need not fear him then.”\r\n\r\nSo the necessary arms were prepared and orders given in the various\r\ncamps. This done the intended victim was invited and plied vigorously\r\nwith wine so that he was quite intoxicated when he left. And, as\r\narranged, the officer mingled with his escort and made away with his\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Tsʻao Tsʻao was at supper with the lady, he heard the\r\nvoices of men and neighing of horses and sent out to ask what it meant.\r\nThey told him it was the night patrol going the rounds and he was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nNear the second watch of the night again was heard some noise in the\r\nrear of his tent and one of the fodder carts was reported to be\r\nburning.\r\n\r\n“One of the men has dropped a spark; there is nothing to be alarmed\r\nat,” said he.\r\n\r\nBut very soon the fire spread on all sides and became alarming. He\r\ncalled Tien Wei. But he, usually so alert, was lying down quite\r\nintoxicated.\r\n\r\nHowever, the beating of gongs and rolling of drums mingling with his\r\ndreams awoke him and he jumped up. His trusty halberd had disappeared.\r\nThe enemy was near. He hastily snatched up an infantryman’s sword and\r\nrushed out. At the gate he saw a crowd of spearmen just bursting in.\r\nTien Wei rushed at them slashing all around him and a score or more\r\nfell beneath his blows. The others drew back. But the spears stood\r\naround him like reeds on the river bank. Being totally without mail he\r\nwas soon wounded in several places. He fought desperately till his\r\nsword snapped and was no longer of any use. Throwing it aside he seized\r\na couple of soldiers and with their bodies as weapons felled half a\r\nscore of his opponents. The others dared not approach, but they shot\r\narrows at him. These fell thick as rain but he still maintained the\r\ngate against the assailants.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mutineers got in by the rear of the camp and one of them\r\nwounded him in the back with a spear thrust. Uttering a loud cry he\r\nfell. The blood gushed from the wound in torrents and he died. Even\r\nafter he was dead not a man dared to come in by the main gate.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao, relying on Tien Wei to hold the main gate, had fled in\r\nhaste by the rear gate. His nephew accompanied him on foot. Then Tsʻao\r\nwas wounded by an arrow in the arm and three arrows struck his horse.\r\nHowever, fortunately, the horse was a fine beast from Tawan full of\r\nspirit and, in spite of his wounds, he bore his master swiftly and well\r\nas far as the Yüshui River.\r\n\r\nHere some of the pursuers came up and his nephew was hacked to pieces.\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao dashed into the river and reached the further side, but\r\nthere an arrow struck his steed in the eye and he fell. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\neldest son dismounted and yielded his horse to his father, who galloped\r\non. His son was killed but he himself got away. Soon after he met\r\nseveral of his officers who had rallied a few soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers under Hsiahou Tun seized the occasion to plunder the\r\npeople. Yü Chin took his men fell upon them and slew many. Thus he\r\nprotected and appeased the people. The plunderers, meeting Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\non the road, knelt down howling and said Yü Chin had mutinied and\r\nattacked them. Tsʻao Tsʻao was surprised and when he met Hsiahou Tun,\r\ngave orders to attack Yü Chin.\r\n\r\nNow when Yü Chin saw his master and a great company approaching he at\r\nonce stopped the attack and set his men to make a camp. Hsün Yü asked\r\nhim why.\r\n\r\n“The Chingchou soldiers say you have turned traitor; why do you not\r\nexplain now that the Minister has arrived? Why first make a camp?” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “Our enemies are coming up in our rear and are very close.\r\nIt is necessary to prepare for defence or we shall not withstand them.\r\nExplanation is a small matter, but defence is very important.”\r\n\r\nSoon after the camp was finished Chang Hsiu fell upon them in two\r\ndivisions. Yü Chin himself rode out to face them. Chang drew back. The\r\nother leader, seeing Yü Chin advance thus boldly, also attacked and\r\nChang Hsiu was overcome. They pursued him a great distance until his\r\nforce was almost annihilated. With the miserable remnant he finally\r\nfled to Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s army reformed and the captains mustered. Then Yü Chin\r\nwent to see his master and told him of the conduct of the Chingchou\r\nsoldiers and their looting and why he had attacked them.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not tell me before you made the camp?”\r\n\r\nYü Chin related what had occurred.\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao, “When the first thought of a leader in the time of greatest\r\nstress is to maintain order and strengthen his defences, giving no\r\nthought to slander but shouldering his burdens manfully, and when he\r\nthereby turns a defeat into a victory, who, even of the ancient\r\nleaders, can excel him?”\r\n\r\nHe rewarded Yü Chin with a service of plate and a marquisate. But he\r\nreprimanded Hsiahou Tun for his lack of discipline.\r\n\r\nSacrifices in honour of the dead warrior Tien Wei were instituted.\r\nTsʻao himself led the wailing and paid due honours. Turning to his\r\nofficers he said, “I have lost my first born son, but I grieve not so\r\nheavily for him as for Tien Wei. I weep for him.”\r\n\r\nAll were sad at the loss of this captain. Then orders were issued to\r\nreturn but nothing will be said here of the march to the capital.\r\n\r\nWhen Wang Tsê, bearing the imperial decree, reached Hsüchou, he was met\r\nby Lü Pu, who conducted him into the residence where the decree was\r\nread. It conferred the title General, “Pacificator of the East,” and a\r\nspecial seal accompanied the mandate. The private letter was also\r\nhanded over and the messenger detailed the high appreciation in which\r\nLü was held by the chief Minister of State.\r\n\r\nNext came news that a messenger from Yüan Shu had arrived. When he had\r\nbeen introduced he said that Shu’s project of declaring himself Emperor\r\nwas advancing. He had already built a palace and would speedily choose\r\nan Empress and concubines and would come to Huainan.\r\n\r\n“Has the rebel gone so far?” cried Lü Pu in a rage.\r\n\r\nHe put the messenger to death and Han Yin into the cangue. He drafted a\r\nmemorial of thanks and sent it to the capital, at the same time\r\nsending, too, Han Yin, the unfortunate agent who had arranged the\r\nmarriage alliance. He also replied to Tsʻao Tsʻao’s private letter\r\nasking to be confirmed in his governorship.\r\n\r\nTsʻao was pleased to hear of the rupture of the marriage arrangement,\r\nand forthwith put Han Yin to death in the market place.\r\n\r\nHowever, Chʻên Têng sent a secret remonstrance to Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nvilifying Lü Pu as cruel, stupid and facile and advising his\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n“I know Lü Pu quite well,” said Tsʻao. “He is a wolf with a savage\r\nheart, and it will be hard to feed him for long. If it had not been for\r\nyou and your father I should not have known all the circumstances and\r\nyou must help me to get rid of him.”\r\n\r\n“Anything the Minister wishes to do shall have my assistance,” was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nAs a reward Tsʻao Tsʻao obtained a grant of grain for the father and a\r\nprefecture for the son, who then took his leave. As he was saying\r\nfarewell Tsʻao took him by the hand saying, “I shall depend upon you in\r\nthe eastern affair.”\r\n\r\nChʻên Têng nodded acquiescence. Then he returned to Lü Pu, who asked\r\nhim how he had fared. Chʻên told him of the gifts to his father, which\r\nannoyed Pu.\r\n\r\n“You did not ask Hsüchou for me, but you got something for yourself.\r\nYour father advised me to help Tsʻao Tsʻao by breaking off the\r\nmarriage, and now I get nothing at all of what I asked while you and\r\nyour father get everything. I have been victimised by your father.”\r\n\r\nHe threatened Chʻên with his sword.\r\n\r\nChʻên Têng only laughed saying, “O how stupid you are, General!”\r\n\r\n“I! How stupid?”\r\n\r\n“When I saw Tsʻao, I said that to keep you going was like feeding a\r\ntiger. The tiger must be kept fully fed or he would eat men. But Tsʻao\r\nlaughed and replied, ‘No; not that. One must treat the marquis like a\r\nfalcon. Not feed it till the foxes and hares are done. Hungry, the bird\r\nis of use; full fed it flies away.’ I asked who were the quarry. He\r\nreplied ‘Yüan Shu, Sun Tsʻê, Yüan Shao, Liu Piao, Liu Chang and Chang\r\nLu; these are the foxes and hares.’”\r\n\r\nLü Pu threw aside his sword and laughed, saying, “Yes; he understands\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nBut just about that time came news of the advance of Yüan Shu on\r\nHsüchou and that frightened Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n\r\n        When discord rose ’twixt Tsʻin and Chin,\r\n        They were attacked by Yüeh and Wu,\r\n        And when a promised bride ne’er came,\r\n        An army marched to enforce the claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow all this fell out will be shown in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAN ARMY OF SEVEN DIVISIONS MARCHES OUT:\r\nTHREE GENERALS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuainan was very fruitful, and Yüan Shu, as governor of such a large\r\ndistrict, was very influential. He was not a little puffed up. The\r\npossession of the Imperial seal, pledged by Sun Tsʻê, added to his\r\npride. And he seriously thought of assuming the full style. As a\r\npreliminary he assembled all his officers and addressed them thus:—\r\n\r\n“Of old Kao-Tsu, Founder of the Dynasty of Han, was only a very minor\r\nofficial and yet he became ruler of the Empire. The Dynasty has endured\r\nfour centuries and its measure of fortune has run out. It no longer\r\npossesses authority; the cauldron is on the point of boiling over. My\r\nfamily has held the highest offices of State for four generations and\r\nis universally respected. Wherefore I wish, in response to the will of\r\nHeaven and the desire of the people, to assume the Imperial dignity.\r\nWhat think ye of the proposal, my officers?”\r\n\r\nThe Recorder, Yen Hsiang, rose in opposition at once. “You may not do\r\nthis. Hou Chi, the Minister of the Chou Dynasty, was of distinguished\r\nvirtue and held many offices, till in the time of Wên Wang he had two\r\nthirds of the Empire. Still he served and was loyal to the Yin Dynasty.\r\nYour house is honourable, but it is not so glorious as that of Chou.\r\nThe Hans may be reduced, but they are not so abominably cruel as Tsou\r\nof the Yins. Indeed this should not be done.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shu did not hear this with pleasure. “We Yüans came from Chʻên and\r\nhe was a descendant of Shun (the Emperor). By the rule of interpreting\r\nthe signs of fate the day has come when earth receives fire. Beside\r\nthere is an oracle saying, ‘He who replaces the Hans must wade through\r\ndeep mire.’ My name means ‘the high road.’ It fits exactly. Further\r\nthan this, I possess the hereditary seal of State and must become lord\r\nof all or I turn from Heaven’s own way. Finally I have made up my mind,\r\nso if any one says too much he will simply suffer death.”\r\n\r\nHe arrogated himself the insignia of royalty. He set up officials with\r\ntitles only given by an Emperor, and rode in a carriage decorated with\r\nthe dragon and phœnix and offered sacrifices after the manner of an\r\nEmperor in the north and south suburbs. Also he appointed an “Empress”\r\nand an “Heir Apparent” (in the Eastern Palace) and pressed for the\r\nearly wedding of Lü Pu’s daughter with his son that the palace\r\nentourage might be complete.\r\n\r\nBut when he heard of the fate of his marriage ambassador he was very\r\nangry and began at once to plan for revenge. Chang Hsün was made\r\nGeneralissimo having under his command more than twenty legions, in\r\nseven divisions under so many commanders, and each of these was\r\ninstructed to make a certain town his objective. The Governor of\r\nYenchou, Chin Shang, was ordered to superintend the commissariat, but\r\nhe declined the office and so was put to death. Chi Ling was in command\r\nof the reserves to help wherever he was required. Yüan Shu led three\r\nlegions and he appointed three tried officers to go up and down and see\r\nthat the various armies did not lag behind.\r\n\r\nLü Pu found out from his scouts that his own city was Chang Hsün’s\r\nobjective; the other towns to be first attacked being Hsiaopʻei, Itu,\r\nLangya, Chiehshih, Hsiapʻei and Chünshan. The armies were marching\r\nfifty li a day, and plundering the countryside as they advanced.\r\n\r\nHe summoned his advisers to a council to which came Chʻên Kung, Chʻên\r\nTêng and his father. When all had assembled Chʻên Kung said, “This\r\nmisfortune that has come to us is due to the two Chʻêns, who fawned\r\nupon the central government in order to obtain rank and appointments.\r\nNow remove the evil by putting these two to death and sending their\r\nheads to our enemy. Then he will retire and leave us in peace.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu acquiesced and had the two arrested. But the son, Chʻên Têng,\r\nonly laughed. “What is this anxiety about?” said he. “These seven\r\narmies are no more to me than so many heaps of rotting straw. They are\r\nnot worth thinking about.”\r\n\r\n“If you can show us how to overcome them I will spare your life,” said\r\nLü.\r\n\r\n“General, if you will listen to a poor stupid fool the city will be\r\nperfectly safe.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hear what you have to say.”\r\n\r\n“Yüan Shu’s men are numerous but they are only a flock of crows; they\r\nare not an army under a leader. There is no mutual confidence. I can\r\nkeep them at bay with the ordinary guards of the place and could\r\novercome them by some unsuspected stratagem. If I should fail I have\r\nanother plan by which I can not only protect the city but capture our\r\nenemy.”\r\n\r\n“Let us have it.”\r\n\r\n“Han Hsien and Yang Fêng, two of the leaders of our enemies, are old\r\nservants of the Han dynasty who fled from fear of Tsʻao Tsʻao and,\r\nbeing homeless, sought refuge with Yüan Shu. He despises them and they\r\nare dissatisfied with his service. A little letter will secure their\r\nhelp as our allies, and with Liu Pei to help us on the outside we can\r\ncertainly overcome Yüan.”\r\n\r\n“You shall take the letters yourself,” said Lü.\r\n\r\nHe agreed and a memorial detailing his intentions was sent to the\r\ncapital, letters to Yüchou to Liu Pei, and finally Chʻên Têng was sent,\r\nwith a small escort, to wait for Han Hsien on the road to Hsiapʻei.\r\nWhen Han Hsien’s army had halted and pitched camp Chʻên Têng went to\r\nsee Han Hsien who said, “What are you here for? You belong to Lü Pu.”\r\n\r\n“I am a noble of the Court of the great Hans. Why do you call me a Lü\r\nPu’s man? If you, General, hitherto a Minister of State, now serve a\r\ntraitor you nullify the grand services you rendered in protecting the\r\nEmperor and I despise you. Beside the suspicious Yüan Shu will\r\nassuredly do you some harm and you will regret not having taken this\r\nopportunity to work against him.”\r\n\r\nHan Hsien sighed. “I would return to my allegiance if there should be\r\nany opportunity.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Chʻên Têng gave him the letter. Han read it and said, “Yes; I\r\nknow. You may return to your master and say General Yang and I will\r\nturn our weapons and smite him. Look out for a signal-flare and let\r\nyour master come to our aid.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Chʻên Têng had got back and reported his success, Lü Pu\r\ndivided his men into five divisions and sent them to five points to\r\nmeet his enemies. He himself led against the main body under Chang\r\nHsün, leaving a guard in the city.\r\n\r\nLü Pu camped thirty li from the walls. When the enemy came up their\r\nleader thought Lü Pu too strong to attack with the force he had, so he\r\nretired twenty li to await reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThat night, in the second watch, Han Hsien and Yang Fêng arrived and\r\nsoon the flare was lighted as arranged. Lü Pu’s men were admitted to\r\nthe camp and caused great confusion. Then Lü Pu himself attacked and\r\nChang Hsün was routed and fled. Lü Pu pursued till daylight when he\r\nfell in with one of the other bodies led by Chi Ling. Both sides faced\r\neach other, but at the very beginning of the engagement the two\r\ntraitors also attacked and Chi Ling was forced to fly.\r\n\r\nLü Pu went in pursuit but soon another force came out from the rear of\r\nsome hills. These looked very imposing. As the ranks opened he saw a\r\nleader’s guard with flags bearing dragons and phœnixes and\r\nrepresentations of the sun and moon, the four “measures,” [8] the five\r\ndirections, [9] golden gourds, silver axes, yellow halberds, white\r\nyaks’ tails, all Imperial emblems. And beneath a yellow silken parasol\r\nsat Yüan Shu on horseback, clad in silver mail with a sword handle\r\nshowing at each wrist.\r\n\r\nStanding out in front of the array he railed at his opponent calling\r\nhim traitor and slave. Lü Pu said nothing but rode forward ready for\r\nbattle and Li Fêng, one of Yüan’s leaders, advanced to take the\r\nchallenge. They met, but at the third bout, Li was wounded in the hand,\r\nwhereupon his spear fell to the ground and he fled. Lü Pu waved on the\r\nadvance and his men prevailed. The other side fled, leaving much spoil,\r\nclothing, mail and horses.\r\n\r\nYüan Shu’s defeated men had not gone far when a strong troop, led by\r\nKuan Yü, appeared barring his way.\r\n\r\n“Traitor! why have they not slain you?” cried Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nWhereat Yüan Shu fled in great trepidation and his army melted into\r\nfugitives in all directions. The new army fell upon them with great\r\nslaughter. Yüan Shu and the remnant of his army retreated into Huainan.\r\n\r\nVictory being now secure, Lü Pu, in company with Kuan Yü, Yang Fêng and\r\nHan Hsien returned to Hsüchou, where there were banquets and feastings\r\nand rewards for the soldiers. These over, Kuan took his leave and\r\nreturned to his brother, while Han Hsien was appointed magistrate of\r\nItu and his friend magistrate of Langya.\r\n\r\nThere had been a question of keeping these two in Hsüchou but Chʻên\r\nKuei opposed it. “Let them hold those places in Shantung, which will be\r\nall yours within a year.” So they were sent to these two cities in the\r\nmeantime to await orders.\r\n\r\n“Why not retain them here?” asked Chʻên Têng secretly of his father.\r\n“They would be a basis for our conspiracy against Lü Pu.”\r\n\r\n“But if they helped him, on the other hand, we should lengthen the\r\ntiger’s claws and teeth,” said his father.\r\n\r\nSo Têng could only approve of his father’s precautions.\r\n\r\nYüan Shu returned home burning to avenge his defeat, so he sent to\r\nChiangtung to ask a loan of men from Sun Tsʻê. Tsʻê said, “On the\r\nstrength of holding the State Seal he secretly calls himself Emperor\r\nand rebels against the Hans. I would rather punish such a renegade than\r\nhelp him.”\r\n\r\nSo he refused. The letter refusing help added to Yüan’s anger. “What\r\nnext from this callow youth?” cried he. “I will smite him before I deal\r\nwith the other.”\r\n\r\nBut Yang Ta-chiang dissuaded him from this course.\r\n\r\nHaving refused help to his powerful rival Sun Tsʻê thought it wise to\r\ntake measures for his own safety. So he stationed an army at\r\nChiangkʻou. Soon after came a messenger from Tsʻao Tsʻao bearing his\r\nappointment as Prefect of Kueichi with orders to raise an army and\r\nreduce Yüan Shu.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê was inclined to carry out these orders but he called a council\r\nat which Chang Chao opposed this course. Said he, “Although recently\r\ndefeated Yüan Shu has many men and ample supplies. He is not to be\r\nattacked lightly. You had better write to Tsʻao Tsʻao persuading him to\r\nattack the south and we will be auxiliaries. Between the two armies Shu\r\nmust certainly be defeated. If by the remotest chance we lose, we have\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao to come to our rescue.”\r\n\r\nThis plan was adopted and a messenger was sent to lay it before Tsʻao.\r\nIn the meantime Tsʻao had reached Hsütu where his first thought was to\r\ninstitute sacrifices to his beloved lost leader Tien Wei. He conferred\r\nrank upon his son Tien Man and took him into his own palace to be cared\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nPresently arrived Sun Tsʻê’s messenger with letters and next came a\r\nreport that Yüan Shu, being short of food, had made a raid on\r\nChʻên-liu. Tsʻao thought the moment opportune, so he issued orders for\r\nthe expedition south, leaving Tsʻao Jên to hold the city. The army\r\nmarched, horse and foot, seventeen legions, with commissariat waggons\r\nof food to the number of over a thousand. Messages were sent to summon\r\nSun Tsʻê, Liu Pei and Lü Pu to assemble on the Yüchang borders.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei was the first to arrive and he was called in to the Minister’s\r\ntent. After the usual salutations two human heads were produced.\r\n\r\n“Whose are these?” asked Tsʻao in surprise.\r\n\r\n“The heads of Han Hsien and Yang Fêng.”\r\n\r\n“Why did this happen?”\r\n\r\n“They were sent to control Itu and Langya and allowed their soldiers to\r\nplunder the people. Bitter complaints arose so I invited them to a\r\nbanquet and my brothers despatched them when I gave the signal by\r\ndropping a cup. Their men gave in at once and now I have to apologise\r\nfor my fault.”\r\n\r\n“You have removed an evil, which is a grand service: why talk of a\r\nfault?”\r\n\r\nAnd he praised Yüan-tê’s action.\r\n\r\nWhen the joint army reached Lü Pu’s borders he came to meet it. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao spoke graciously to him and conferred upon him the title of\r\nGeneralissimo of the Left, promising him a suitable seal as soon as he\r\nreturned to the capital. Lü Pu was very pleased.\r\n\r\nThen the three armies were made into one force, Tsʻao Tsʻao being in\r\nthe centre and the other two on the wings. Hsiahou Tun and Yü Chin were\r\nleaders of the van.\r\n\r\nOn Yüan Shu’s side Chʻiao Sui with five legions was appointed van\r\nleader. The armies met on the confines of Shouchʻun. The two van\r\nleaders rode out and opened battle. Chʻiao Sui fell in the third bout\r\nand his men fled into the city.\r\n\r\nThen came news that Sun Tsʻê’s fleet was near and would attack on the\r\nwest. The other three land corps took each one face and the city was in\r\na parlous state.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Yüan Shu summoned his officers. Yang Ta-chiang\r\nexplained the case, “Shouchʻun has suffered from drought for several\r\nyears and the people are on the verge of famine. Sending an army would\r\nadd to the distress and anger the people, and victory would be\r\nuncertain. I advise not to send any more soldiers there, but to hold on\r\ntill the besiegers are conquered by lack of supplies. Our noble chief,\r\nwith his regiment of guards, will move over to the other side of the\r\nriver, which is quite ready, and we shall also escape the enemy’s\r\nferocity.”\r\n\r\nSo due arrangements being made to guard Shouchʻun a general move was\r\nmade to the other side of the Huai River. Not only the army went over\r\nbut all the accumulated wealth of the Yüan family, gold and silver,\r\njewels and precious stones, were moved.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s army of seventeen legions needed daily no inconsiderable\r\nquantity of food, and as the country around had been famine-stricken\r\nfor several years nothing could be got there. So he tried to hasten the\r\nmilitary operations and capture the city. On the other hand, the\r\ndefenders knew the value of delay and simply held on. After a month’s\r\nvigorous siege the fall of the city seemed as far off as it was at\r\nfirst and supplies were very short. Letters were sent to Sun Tsʻê who\r\nsent a hundred thousand measures of grain. When the usual distribution\r\nbecame impossible the Chief of the Commissariat, Jên Hsün, and the\r\nController of the Granaries, Wang Hou, presented a statement asking\r\nwhat was to be done.\r\n\r\n“Serve out with a smaller measure,” said Tsʻao. “That will save us for\r\na time.”\r\n\r\n“But if the soldiers murmur, what then?”\r\n\r\n“I shall have another device.”\r\n\r\nAs ordered the controllers issued grain in a short measure. Tsʻao sent\r\nsecretly to find out how the men took this and when he found that\r\ncomplaints were general and they were saying that he was fooling them,\r\nhe sent a secret summons to the controller. When he came Tsʻao said, “I\r\nwant to ask you to lend me something to pacify the soldiers with. You\r\nmust not refuse.”\r\n\r\n“What does the Minister wish?”\r\n\r\n“I want the loan of your head to expose to the soldiery.”\r\n\r\n“But I have done nothing wrong!” exclaimed the unhappy man.\r\n\r\n“I know that, but if I do not put you to death there will be a mutiny.\r\nAfter you are gone your wife and children shall be my care. So you need\r\nnot grieve on their account.”\r\n\r\nWang Hou was about to remonstrate further but Tsʻao Tsʻao gave a\r\nsignal, the executioners hustled him out and he was beheaded. His head\r\nwas exposed on a tall pole and a notice said that in accordance with\r\nmilitary law Wang Hou had been put to death for peculation and the use\r\nof a short measure in issuing grain.\r\n\r\nThis appeased the discontent. Next followed a general order threatening\r\ndeath to the various commanders if the city was not taken within three\r\ndays. Tsʻao Tsʻao in person went up to the very walls to superintend\r\nthe work of filling up the moat. The defenders kept up constant showers\r\nof stones and arrows. Two inferior officers, who left their stations in\r\nfear, were slain by Tsʻao Tsʻao himself. Thereafter he went on foot to\r\nsee that work went on continuously and no one dared be a laggard. Thus\r\nencouraged the army became invincible and no defence could withstand\r\ntheir onslaught. In a very short time the walls were scaled, the gates\r\nbattered in and the besiegers were in possession. The officers of the\r\ngarrison were captured alive and were executed in the market place. All\r\nthe paraphernalia of imperial state were burned and the whole city\r\nwrecked.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of crossing the river in pursuit of Yüan Shu came up\r\nHsün Yü opposed it saying, “The country has suffered from short crops\r\nfor years and we should be unable to get grain. An advance would weary\r\nthe army, harm the people and possibly end in disaster. I advise a\r\nreturn to the capital to wait there till the spring wheat shall have\r\nbeen harvested and we have plenty of food.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao hesitated and before he had made up his mind there came an\r\nurgent message saying Chang Hsiu, with the support of Liu Piao, was\r\nravaging the country all round, that there was rebellion in Nanyang and\r\nTsʻao Hung could not cope with it. He had been worsted already in\r\nseveral engagements and was in sore straits.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao at once wrote to Sun Tsʻê to command the river so as to\r\nprevent any move on the part of Liu Piao, while he prepared his army to\r\ngo to deal with Chang Hsiu. Before marching he directed Liu Pei to camp\r\nat Hsiaopʻei, as he and Lü Pu, being as brothers, might help each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhen Lü Pu had left for Hsüchou Tsʻao Tsʻao said secretly to Yüan-tê,\r\n“I am leaving you at Hsiaopʻei as a pitfall for the tiger. You will\r\nonly take advice from the two Chʻêns and there can be no mishap. You\r\nwill find so-and-so your ally when needed.”\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao Tsʻao marched to Hsütu where he heard that Tuan Wei had slain\r\nLi Tsʻui and Wu Hsi had killed Kuo Ssŭ and they presented the heads of\r\nthese two. Beside the whole clan of Li Tsʻui had been arrested and\r\nbrought to the capital. They were all put to death at various gates and\r\ntheir heads exposed. People thought this very harsh dealing.\r\n\r\nIn the Emperor’s palace a large number of officials were assembled at a\r\npeace banquet. The two successful leaders Tuan and Wu were rewarded\r\nwith titles and sent to guard Chʻangan. They came to audience to\r\nexpress their gratitude and marched away.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao sent in a memorial that Chang Hsiu was in rebellion\r\nand an army must be sent against him. The Emperor in person arranged\r\nthe chariot and escorted his Minister out of the city when he went to\r\ntake command of the expedition. It was the summer, the fourth month of\r\nthe third year of the period Chien-An (199 A.D.). Hsün Yü was in chief\r\nmilitary command in Hsütu.\r\n\r\nThe army marched away. In the course of the march they passed through a\r\nwheat district and the grain was ready for harvesting but the peasants\r\nhad fled for fear and the corn was uncut. Tsʻao Tsʻao caused it to be\r\nmade known all about that he was sent on the expedition by command of\r\nthe Emperor to capture a rebel and save the people. He could not avoid\r\nmoving in the harvest season but if any one trampled down the corn he\r\nshould be put to death. Military law was so severe that the people need\r\nfear no damage. The people were very pleased and lined the road,\r\nwishing success to the expedition. When the soldiers passed wheatfields\r\nthey dismounted and pushed aside the stalks so that none were trampled\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Tsʻao Tsʻao was riding through the fields, a dove\r\nsuddenly got up, startling the horse so that he swerved into the\r\nstanding grain and a large patch was trampled down. Tsʻao at once\r\ncalled the Provost Marshal and bade him decree the sentence for the\r\ncrime of trampling down corn.\r\n\r\n“How can I deal with your crime?” asked the Provost Marshal.\r\n\r\n“I made the rule and I have broken it. Can I otherwise satisfy public\r\nopinion?”\r\n\r\nHe laid hold of the sword by his side and made to take his own life.\r\nAll hastened to prevent him and Kuo Chia said, “In ancient days, the\r\ndays of the Spring and Autumn history, the laws were not applied to the\r\npersons of the most honourable. You are the supreme leader of a mighty\r\narmy and must not wound yourself.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao pondered for a long time. At last he said, “Since there\r\nexists the reason just quoted I may perhaps escape the death penalty.”\r\n\r\nThen with his sword he cut off his hair and threw it on the ground\r\nsaying, “I cut off the hair as touching the head.”\r\n\r\nThen he sent a man to exhibit the hair throughout the whole army\r\nsaying, “The Minister, having trodden down some corn, ought to have\r\nlost his head by the terms of the order; now here is his hair cut off\r\nas an attack on the head.”\r\n\r\nThis deed was a stimulus to discipline all through the army so that not\r\na man dared be disobedient. A poet wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    A myriad soldiers march along and all are brave and bold,\r\n    And their myriad inclinations by one leader are controlled.\r\n    That crafty leader shore his locks when forfeit was his head,\r\n    O full of guile wert thou, Tsʻao Tsʻao, as every one has said.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first news of the approach of Tsʻao Tsʻao with an army Chang\r\nHsiu wrote to Liu Piao for help. Then he sent out his men under command\r\nof Lei Hsü and Chang Hsien. When the array was complete Chang Hsiu took\r\nhis station in front and pointing at Tsʻao Tsʻao railed at him saying,\r\n“O false and pretended supporter of benevolence and justice! O\r\nshameless one! You are just a beast of the forest, and absolutely\r\ndevoid of humanity.”\r\n\r\nThis annoyed Tsʻao Tsʻao who sent out Hsü Chʻu against the insulter.\r\nChang Hsien came to meet him and fell in the third bout. Thence Chang\r\nHsiu’s men fled and were pursued to the very walls of Nanyang, only\r\nmanaging to get within just before the pursuit came up. The city was\r\nthen closely besieged. Seeing the moat was so wide and deep that\r\napproach to the wall would be difficult they began to fill up the ditch\r\nwith earth. Then with sand bags, brushwood and bundles of grass they\r\nbuilt a great mound near the wall and on this erected steps so that\r\nthey could look over into the city.\r\n\r\nTsʻao rode round the city closely inspecting the defences. Three days\r\nlater he issued an order to make a mound of earth and brushwood at the\r\nnorth west angle, as he would mount the walls at that point. He was\r\nobserved from within the city by Chia Hsü, who went to his chief and\r\nsaid, “I know what he intends and I can defeat him by a counter-move.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        E’en amongst the very foremost\r\n            There is one who leads the way;\r\n        Some one sees through your devices,\r\n            Be as crafty as ye may.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the counter-move was will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCHIA HSÜ ENGINEERS A GREAT VICTORY:\r\nHSIAHOU TUN LOSES AN EYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChia Hsü, as he had guessed the enemy’s intention, had also devised a\r\ncounter-move. So he went to his chief and said, “I saw Tsʻao Tsʻao very\r\ncarefully reconnoitring round about the city and he certainly noticed\r\nthat the south-east angle of the wall had been lately restored with mud\r\nbricks of a different kind and that the abatis is badly out of repair.\r\nHe will try to effect an entrance there. Wherefore he is making a feint\r\nattack at the opposite point. He is piling up straw and making\r\nostentatious preparations whereby to cajole us into withdrawing from\r\nthe real point of attack to defend the north-west. His men will scale\r\nthe walls in the darkness and try to enter at the south-east.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing your surmise correct, what do you advise?” asked Chang Hsiu.\r\n\r\n“The counter-move is plain. You issue an order for our best and bravest\r\nsoldiers to fill their bellies, to take only the lightest outfit and\r\nconceal themselves in the houses near the south-east corner. Then\r\ndisguise the townspeople as soldiers and send them to pretend to defend\r\nthe north-west. To-night we will let the enemy climb up the walls and\r\nenter the city and, once they are fairly within, give the signal and\r\nthe concealed soldiers will rush out upon them. We may even capture\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao himself.”\r\n\r\nThe stratagem was decided upon. Soon the scouts told Tsʻao that the\r\ndefenders of the city had moved to the north-west where noisy\r\npreparations for defence were going on. The opposite corner was left\r\nundefended.\r\n\r\n“They have fallen into my trap,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao gleefully.\r\n\r\nThey prepared shovels and hooks and all the gear needed for scaling\r\nwalls, and all day they kept up the attack on the north-west angle.\r\n\r\nBut at the second watch they despatched the veterans to the opposite\r\ncorner, where they climbed the wall, broke up the abatis and got into\r\nthe city apparently without disturbing any of the guards. There was no\r\nsign of life anywhere as they entered. But just as they were leaving\r\nthe wall suddenly a bomb exploded and they found themselves in an\r\nambush. They turned to retire, but Chang Hsiu immediately fell on the\r\nrear. Tsʻao’s men were totally defeated and fled out of the gate into\r\nthe country. Chang Hsiu kept up the pursuit till daybreak, when he\r\nretired into the city again.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao then rallied his army and mustered his men. He had lost\r\nfive legions and much baggage, while two of his captains, Lü Chʻien and\r\nYü Chin were wounded.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao being thus worsted, Chang Hsiu wrote off to Liu Piao to cut\r\noff his retreat that he might be utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\nAn army was preparing for this purpose when a scout came to say that\r\nSun Tsʻê had encamped at Hukʻou. Kʻuai Liang urged the immediate\r\ndeparture of the expedition as he said this move of Sun Tsʻê was part\r\nof Tsʻao Tsʻao’s strategy and there would be never-ending regret if he\r\nwere allowed to escape. Wherefore Liu Piao moved out with his army to\r\nAnchung, leaving Huang Tsu to hold the point of vantage. Chang Hsiu,\r\nhaving been informed of the movement to attack his enemy in the rear,\r\nwent with Chia Hsü to smite him once more.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army, marching very leisurely, had\r\narrived at Hsianchʻêng. Walking one day beside the Yushui River he\r\nsuddenly uttered a great cry, and when his officers asked the reason\r\nthereof he replied, “I remembered that here, only a year ago, I lost my\r\ngreat captain Tien Wei. Is that not a reason to grieve?”\r\n\r\nThereupon he gave orders to halt while he should make a great sacrifice\r\nand mourn for his lost leader. At the ceremony he himself burned\r\nincense and wailed and prostrated himself. The army was much affected\r\nby his devotion. After the sacrifices to the lost hero, he sacrificed\r\nto the names of his nephew Tsʻao An-ming and his eldest son Tsʻao An,\r\nboth of whom had died at the same time. He also sacrificed to his lost\r\nsoldiers and even to his steed which had been killed by an arrow.\r\n\r\nSoon Hsün Yü wrote to tell him that Liu Piao had gone to help Chang\r\nHsiu and was camped at Anchung, thereby cutting his road of retreat.\r\nTsʻao replied to the letter saying, “I have been marching only a short\r\ndistance each day and of course knew of the pursuit. But my plans are\r\nlaid and, as I near Anchung, my enemy will be broken. You need not have\r\nany fears.”\r\n\r\nThen he hastened his march till he came near where Liu Piao had taken\r\nposition. Chang Hsiu still followed. Tsʻao ordered his men during the\r\nnight to open a secret way through a pass, where he laid an ambush.\r\n\r\nWith the first light of dawn Liu and Chang met. As Tsʻao Tsʻao’s force\r\nlooked small, they thought he had retired so they boldly advanced into\r\nthe pass to smite him. Then the ambush was opened and both the\r\nattackers’ forces were cut up. The fighting ended, Tsʻao’s soldiers\r\nwent outside the pass and encamped.\r\n\r\nThe two leaders on the other side restored order among their beaten men\r\nand then held a conference.\r\n\r\n“How could we have foreseen such a wicked ruse?” said Liu Piao.\r\n\r\n“Let us try again,” said his colleague.\r\n\r\nWherefore they joined forces at Anchung.\r\n\r\nBut Hsün Yü discovered through his spies that Yüan Shao was preparing\r\nan attack on Hsütu, the then capital, so he at once wrote to Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao who, much disturbed by this news, set out homeward at once. When\r\nChang Hsiu heard this through his scouts he wished to follow the\r\nretreating army. Chia Hsü opposed it and said it would lead to a\r\ndefeat. However Liu Piao was also of opinion that it was wrong to lose\r\nsuch a chance and so finally pursuit was decided upon.\r\n\r\nThey had not marched very far before they came upon Tsʻao’s rear-guard,\r\nwho fought with great vigour and bravery, so that the pursuers were\r\nbeaten off and went home discomfited.\r\n\r\nChang Hsiu said to Chia, “This defeat comes from my not following your\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\n“Now set your army in order and pursue,” said Chia.\r\n\r\n“But we have just suffered defeat!” cried both leaders. “Do you now\r\ncounsel pursuit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the result will be a great victory if you go now. I will\r\nventure my head on that,” said Chia.\r\n\r\nChang Hsiu had confidence, but his colleague was afraid and would not\r\naccompany him. So one army only started in pursuit.\r\n\r\nHowever, this was enough. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s rear-guard was thoroughly\r\nrouted and abandoned their waggons and their baggage in their hasty\r\nflight. Chang Hsiu pursued, but suddenly a troop came out from the\r\nshelter of some hills and checked him. Fearful to try further he\r\nhastened back to Anchung.\r\n\r\nThe other general, Liu Piao, asked the adviser to explain his apparent\r\ninconsistency. “When our veteran and brave soldiers were going to\r\npursue those who retreated you said our men would lose the day; and\r\nwhen defeated men pursued the victors you foretold victory. You were\r\nright in both cases, but we wish you would enlighten us.”\r\n\r\n“It is easy to explain. You, Generals, although skilled leaders, are\r\nnot a match for our enemy. Though the enemy had lost a battle he had\r\nable captains to keep the rear and guard against pursuit. Our men are\r\ngood, but not a match for them. That is how I knew. Forasmuch as Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s hurried retreat was due to trouble in the capital and he had\r\nbeaten off our men, I knew he would retire at his utmost speed and not\r\ntake his usual precautions. I ventured to take advantage of his\r\nlaxity.”\r\n\r\nLiu and Chang could not but affirm his complete understanding of the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Chia Hsü then Liu Piao returned to Chingchou, while\r\nChang Hsiu took up his position at Hsiangchʻêng so that each\r\nstrengthened the other as the lips protect the teeth from cold.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao, during his retreat, heard that his army was being pursued\r\nhe hastily turned back to support the rear-guard. Then he saw the\r\npursuing army draw off. The soldiers of the beaten rear-guard said,\r\n“Had it not been for the troop that came out of the hills we should all\r\nhave been lost.”\r\n\r\n“What troop?” asked Tsʻao Tsʻao in surprise.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the troop then advanced, slung his spear and,\r\ndismounting, made a low obeisance. He was Li Tʻung, a captain of some\r\nrank and reputation from Chianghsia.\r\n\r\nTsʻao asked him why he had come.\r\n\r\nLi Tʻung replied, “I was in command at Junan when I heard of the\r\nstruggle going on, so I came to lend you any help I could.”\r\n\r\nTo show his gratitude Tsʻao conferred upon Li the title Marquis of\r\nEstablished Merit, and confirmed him in his command as a defence\r\nagainst Liu Piao. Then Li Tʻung took his leave.\r\n\r\nOn his return to the capital Tsʻao Tsʻao presented a memorial on the\r\ngood services rendered by Sun Tsʻê and he was created Marquis of Wu\r\nwith the title General “Captor of Rebels.” The messenger bearing the\r\ndecree bore also the order to repress Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao went to his palace and there received the ceremonial calls\r\nof congratulation. These finished, Hsün Yü asked, saying, “You, Sir,\r\nmarched very leisurely to Anchung; how came it that you felt certain of\r\nvictory?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “He who retires and finds his retreat cut off fights\r\ndesperately. I retired slowly to entice them into following whereby I\r\ncould do as I wished with them. Basing my movements on these\r\nconsiderations I felt secure.”\r\n\r\nHsün bowed his head in admiration.\r\n\r\nWhen Kuo Chia entered Tsʻao said, “Why so late, Sir?”\r\n\r\nThe visitor drew a letter from his sleeve saying to his master, “Yüan\r\nShao sends this saying he desires to send an army to attack Kungsun\r\nTsan and wishes you to lend provisions and men.”\r\n\r\n“I heard he was going to attack Hsütu; I suppose my return has made him\r\nchange his intention,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen he opened the letter and read it. It was couched in very arrogant\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n“He is so exceedingly rude that I will attack him,” said Tsʻao, “Only I\r\nthink I am not quite strong enough. What should be done?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, you know well who lost, and why, in the conflict between Liu\r\nPang and Hsiang Yü; the former won only by superior wisdom. Hsiang Yü\r\nwas the stronger, but in the end he was overcome. Your rival has ten\r\nweak points whereas you have ten strong ones, and, though his army is\r\nlarge, it is not terrible.\r\n\r\n“Shao is over-much devoted to ceremony and deportment; while you are\r\nsympathetic and natural; this is an excellence in conduct. He is\r\nantagonistic and drives; you are conciliatory and lead; so you have the\r\nadvantage of popular approval. For many years the government has been\r\nlax and he makes it more so: you strive vigorously after efficiency;\r\nthis is the excellence of able administration. He is outwardly liberal\r\nbut grudging at heart, and too given to nepotism: you appear exacting,\r\nbut you understand and use men after their ability; this is the\r\nadvantage of correct appreciation. He is a visionary and lacking in\r\ndecision: you are a man of prompt decision and direct action; this is\r\nan advantage in policy. He loves to gather about him men of renown: you\r\ntreat a man as you find him regardless of his reputation; this is where\r\nyou excel in moral virtue. He is compassionate to those at hand, but\r\ncareless about those out of sight: your care is all-embracing; this is\r\nwhere you excel in humanity. He lends a ready ear to calumny and is\r\nmisled: you may be flooded with evil counsel, but you preserve\r\nindependence; this is where you excel in perspicacity. His sense of\r\nright and wrong is confused: your appreciation is accurate and clear;\r\nthis is where you excel in administrative capacity. He loves the\r\nmake-believe force, but is ignorant of military essentials: you would\r\novercome with far inferior numbers as you possess military genius; this\r\nis where you excel in war. With your ten superiorities you will have no\r\ndifficulty in overcoming Shao.”\r\n\r\n“How can I be worth as much as you say?” said Tsʻao, smiling.\r\n\r\n“What he has said about the ten points in your favour agrees exactly\r\nwith what I think,” said Hsün Yü. “Shao’s army is not formidable in\r\nspite of its size.”\r\n\r\n“The real and dangerous enemy is Lü Pu,” said Kuo Chia. “When Yüan Shao\r\nhas gone north to destroy Kunsun Tsan, we ought to sweep away Lü Pu and\r\nso clear away our danger from that side, for if this is not done our\r\nattack on Shao will be the signal for an attempt on the capital. That\r\nwould be most serious.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao saw things in the same light as his advisers and began to\r\ndiscuss plans for an attack on Lü Pu. Hsün Yü was of opinion that they\r\nshould first secure the fidelity and aid of Liu Pei. So letters were\r\nwritten and they waited his assurance before moving a soldier. Then, in\r\norder to reassure Yüan Shao, his emissary was treated with great\r\nkindness and a memorial presented asking extra honours for him. With\r\nall this a private letter was written urging upon him to attack Kungsun\r\nand promising assistance. So Yüan Shao’s army started.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the two Chʻêns were playing their game. At every feast\r\nand gathering in Hsüchou they uttered the most fulsome praises of Lü\r\nPu. Chʻên Kung was greatly displeased and took an opportunity to talk\r\nabout them to his master. “They flatter you to your face, but what is\r\nin their hearts? You ought to be most carefully on your guard.”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue!” was the angry reply. “You are simply slandering\r\nthem without the slightest excuse. You want to harm good men.”\r\n\r\n“No ears for loyal words”; said Chʻên Kung, as he went away sad at\r\nheart, “and we shall suffer.”\r\n\r\nHe thought seriously of abandoning Lü Pu, but that would be too painful\r\na wrench. Beside he feared people would laugh at him.\r\n\r\nSo the days passed sorrowfully for him. One day, with a few horsemen,\r\nhe rode out to the country near Hsiaopʻei to hunt. On the high road he\r\nsaw a messenger galloping along in hot haste and began to wonder what\r\nit might mean. He left the hunt, rode across country and intercepted\r\nthe rider.\r\n\r\n“Where are you from? Who sent you?” asked Chʻên Kung.\r\n\r\nThe messenger made no reply for he knew to what party his captors\r\nbelonged. But they searched him and found a letter, the secret reply to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s letter to Liu Pei. The messenger and the letter were both\r\ntaken straight to Lü Pu. He questioned the man, who said he had been\r\nsent to Liu Pei with a letter and was now taking back the reply. He\r\nknew nothing more. He was ignorant of the contents of the letter. So Lü\r\nPu tore it open and read:—“I have received your commands concerning the\r\ndestruction of Lü Pu and dare I for a moment venture to disregard them?\r\nBut my force is weak and I must act with extreme circumspection. If you\r\nmove your main body, then I will hasten forward and in the meantime my\r\nmen shall be got ready and weapons prepared. I await your command.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu was really alarmed. “The wretch!” said he, “To dare to act thus!”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy messenger was put to death and counter-moves planned. Chʻên\r\nKung and Tsang Pa went to enlist the help of the Tʻaishan bandits and\r\ntake Yenchou in Shantung. Kao Shun and Chang Liao went to attack Liu\r\nPei in Pʻeichʻêng. Sung Hsieu and Wei Hsü went west to attack Juying\r\nand Lü Pu took command of a large body of men ready to afford help\r\nwherever needed.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the army under Kao Shun against Hsiaopʻei was told Liu\r\nPei who assembled his officers at a council. Sun Chʻien advised sending\r\na message to the capital to inform Tsʻao Tsʻao of their danger and, in\r\nresponse to the chief’s call, Chien Yung, a fellow-townsman of Liu\r\nPei’s, offered to take the message. Up to that moment he had served as\r\na secretary. So a letter was written and the late secretary set out at\r\nonce on his journey.\r\n\r\nThen preparations were made for defence, Yüan-tê commanding at the\r\nsouth gate and the two brothers and Sun Chʻien taking each a gate. Mi\r\nChu and his brother Fang commanded the family guard.\r\n\r\nThe two Mi’s were put in command of the house guard because they were\r\nLiu Pei’s brothers-in-law, he having taken a sister of Mi Chu as a\r\nsecond wife. Hence they were suitable men to guard the family.\r\n\r\nIn due course Kao Shun came to the south gate. Liu Pei ascended the\r\ntower and said, “I have no quarrel with your master, why do you come\r\nhere with an army?”\r\n\r\n“You have plotted with Tsʻao Tsʻao to injure my master as we know now;\r\nwhy should I not ‘bind’ you?”\r\n\r\nSo saying he gave the signal to attack. But Yüan-tê did not go out to\r\nrepulse him; he only kept the gate fast closed.\r\n\r\nSoon after Chang Liao led an attack on the west gate, then kept by\r\nYün-chʻang, who addressed him from the wall.\r\n\r\n“You are too good a man to waste yourself on rebels,” said he.\r\n\r\nChang hung his head and made no reply.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü knew that he had a sound heart and high principles and said no\r\nmore as he was unwilling to wound him. Nor did he go out to attack.\r\n\r\nChang Liao then drew off and proceeded to the east gate, and Chang Fei\r\nwent out to give battle. Soon it was told Kuan Yü, who came over\r\nquickly. He saw Chang Fei going out, but Chang Liao was already\r\nwithdrawing. Fei wished to pursue, but his brother held him back.\r\n\r\n“He is afraid and so has gone away; it would be best to pursue,” said\r\nFei.\r\n\r\n“No,” said his brother. “As a warrior he is not inferior to either of\r\nus, but I have spoken a few straight words and they have sunk deep. He\r\nis repentant and that is why he will not meet us.”\r\n\r\nSo Chang Fei understood and the gates were shut and orders given for\r\ncareful defence.\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei’s messenger reached the capital he saw Tsʻao Tsʻao who\r\ntold him what had happened. The advisers were called to discuss a plan.\r\nTsʻao said, “I wish to attack Lü Pu. I fear not Yüan Shao, but Liu Piao\r\nand Chang Hsiu may attack me in the rear.”\r\n\r\nHsün Yü replied. “Both these latter have been too recently defeated to\r\ndo anything so rash. But Lü Pu is a bold fighting man, and if he joined\r\nforces with Yüan Shu and they set themselves to conquer Huai and Ssŭ\r\n[10] the problem would be difficult.”\r\n\r\nThen spoke Kuo Chia, “Let us take advantage of the moment before they\r\nhave fully made up their mind. Smite before they are fully prepared.”\r\nAnd Tsʻao Tsʻao did so. Five legions with four captains were sent in\r\nadvance. Tsʻao commanded the rear army, which marched by divisions, and\r\nChien Yung brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nSoon the scouts informed Kao Shun. He sent flying messengers to Lü Pu,\r\nwho detached two hundred horse to assist him. Kao Shun posted this\r\nreinforcement about thirty li from the city to meet Tsʻao’s army. He\r\nfollowed close.\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei saw the enemy retiring from the city he knew Tsʻao’s army\r\nwas close at hand. So, making arrangements for guarding the city\r\nwithin, he and his two brothers marched their men out of the city and\r\nmade a camp, that they might be ready to assist.\r\n\r\nNow the division of Tsʻao’s army under Hsiahou Tun, having marched out\r\nin advance, first came into touch with Kao Shun. The former captain at\r\nonce rode out with spear set and offered a challenge. It was accepted\r\nand the two leaders fought half a hundred bouts. Then Kao Shun began to\r\nweaken and had to own he had lost the day. His adversary pressed him\r\nhard and he rode round to the rear of his array. Tun was not the man to\r\nquail so he followed right into the enemy’s country. Then Tsʻao Hsing,\r\none of the captains, secretly strung his bow, fitted an arrow and, when\r\nTun had come quite near, shot at him. The arrow hit Hsiahou Tun full in\r\nthe left eye. He shrieked, and putting up his head, pulled out the\r\narrow and with it the eye.\r\n\r\n“Essence of my father, blood of my mother, I cannot throw this away,”\r\ncried he, and he put the eye into his mouth and swallowed it.\r\n\r\nThen resuming his firm grip of his spear he went after this new enemy.\r\n\r\nThere was no escape for Tsʻao Hsing. He was overtaken and fell with a\r\nspear wound full in the face. Both sides were stricken dumb with\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nHaving thus slain the man who had wounded him Tun rode back toward his\r\nown side. Kao Shun went in pursuit and, waving on his men, attacked so\r\nvigorously that he won the day. Hsiahou Tun saved his elder brother,\r\nwith whom he fled. The various divisions rallied at Chipei and made a\r\ncamp there.\r\n\r\nKao Shun having scored this victory, returned to attack Liu Pei, and as\r\nLü Pu opportunely arrived with Chang Liao, these three arranged their\r\nforces so that each attacked one of the brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Dauntless was Tun, that warrior bold,\r\n        His courage had been proved of old;\r\n        But smitten sore one hapless day,\r\n        He might not in the battle stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of Yüan-tê will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO FIGHTS AT HSIAPʻEI:\r\nLÜ PU PERISHES AT THE WHITE GATE TOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was stated before, Kao Shun and Chang Liao together went to smite\r\nKuan Yü, while Lü Pu attacked the younger brother’s camp. Both brothers\r\nwent out to give battle, while Liu Pei’s force was held in reserve. Lü\r\nPu attacked from the rear and the brothers were forced to flee. Liu Pei\r\nwith a few score horsemen rushed back to Pʻeichʻêng. As he approached\r\nthe gate with Lü Pu pressing him close, he shouted to the soldiers on\r\nthe wall to lower the drawbridge. Lü Pu was so close behind that the\r\narchers on the wall feared to shoot lest they should wound their lord\r\nand so Lü Pu got into the gate. The gate guards could not force him\r\nback so they scattered in all directions. Lü Pu led his force into the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nLiu Yüan-tê saw the position was too desperate for him to reach his\r\nresidence and he must abandon all his family. So he hastened through\r\nthe city and left by the west gate out at which he and his scanty\r\nfollowing fled for very life.\r\n\r\nWhen Lü Pu reached the residence he was met by Mi Chu who said, “The\r\nhero does not destroy a man’s wife. Your rival for the Empire is Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, and my master, always mindful of the good turn you did him at\r\nyour gate, would not be ungrateful. But he could not help going to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao and I think you will pity him.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu replied, “We two are old friends; how could I bear to harm his\r\nwife and children?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he sent the family to Hsüchou with Mi Chu to take care of\r\nthem. Next Lü led his army into Shantung to Yenchou, leaving Kao Shun\r\nand Chang Liao to guard Hsiaopʻei.\r\n\r\nDuring these troubles Sun Chʻien had also fled out of the city and the\r\ntwo brothers, each with a handful of men, had got away to the hills. As\r\nLiu Pei with his few horsemen was making the best of their way from the\r\nscene of his defeat he heard some one coming up behind him. When he got\r\ncloser the person proved to be Sun Chʻien.\r\n\r\n“Alas! I know not the fate of my brothers, whether they be alive or\r\ndead, and my wife and children are lost to me! What can I do?” said Liu\r\nPei.\r\n\r\nSun replied, “I see nothing better than getting away to Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nwhence we may be able to plan our future moves.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei had no better plan to propose and the two men directed their\r\nway to Hsütu, choosing bye-roads rather than highways. When their small\r\nsupplies ran out they entered a village to beg. But when the people of\r\nany place heard that Liu of Yüchou was the man who needed help they\r\nvied with each other in offering all that was required.\r\n\r\nOne day they sought shelter at a house whence a youth came out and made\r\na low obeisance. They asked his name and he gave it as Liu An, of a\r\nwell known family of hunters. Hearing who the visitor was the hunter\r\nwished to lay before him a dish of game, but though he sought for a\r\nlong time nothing could be found for the table. So he came home, killed\r\nhis wife and prepared a portion for his guest. While eating Liu Pei\r\nasked what flesh it was and the hunter told him “wolf.” Yüan-tê knew no\r\nbetter and ate his fill. Next day at daylight, just as he was leaving,\r\nhe went to the stables in the rear to get his horse and passing through\r\nthe kitchen he saw the dead body of a woman lying on the table. The\r\nflesh of one arm had been cut away. Quite startled he asked what this\r\nmeant, and then he knew what he had eaten the night before. He was\r\ndeeply affected at this proof of his host’s regard and the tears rained\r\ndown as he mounted his steed at the gate.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could go with you,” said Liu An, “but as my mother still\r\nlives I cannot go so far from home.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei thanked him and went his way. The party took the road by\r\nLiangchʻêng and as they were going out they saw not far off a thick\r\ncloud of dust. When the troop came nearer they found they were men of\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s army, and with them they travelled to the main camp where\r\nthey found Tsʻao Tsʻao himself. He wept at the sad story of Liu’s\r\ndistress, the loss of the city, his brothers and wife and children.\r\nWhen he told him of the hunter who had sacrificed his wife to feed them\r\nTsʻao sent the hunter a present of a hundred ounces of silver as a\r\nreward. [11]\r\n\r\nThe march then was continued to Chipei, where Hsiahou Yüan welcomed\r\nthem. They heard that his brother was still ill from the wound he had\r\nreceived in the eye. Tsʻao Tsʻao went to the sick man’s bedside to see\r\nhim and had him removed to Hsütu for skilled treatment.\r\n\r\nPresently scouts, sent out particularly for tidings of Lü Pu, returned\r\nsaying that he had allied himself with the bandits in the east and they\r\nwere attacking Yenchou. At this Tsʻao Tsʻao despatched Tsʻao Jên with\r\nthree companies to take Pʻeichʻêng, while he, in conjunction with Liu\r\nPei, moved against Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nThey went east. As they neared Artemisia Pass (Hsiao Kuan) they met the\r\nTʻaishan brigands with three legions barring their road. However, they\r\nwere easily beaten back and were chased right up to the pass.\r\n\r\nThe scouts told Lü Pu, who was then in Hsüchou, whither he had gone to\r\nstart an expedition to save Hsiaopʻei. He left the protection of his\r\ncity to Chʻên Kuei and set out with Chʻên Têng.\r\n\r\nAs this latter was starting Chʻên Kuei said to him, “Remember the words\r\nof Tsʻao Tsʻao, that the business of the east is in our hands. Now is\r\nour moment for Lü Pu is about to suffer defeat.”\r\n\r\n“Father, your son can look after the outside. But when he returns\r\nbeaten you must arrange with Mi Chu to keep him out of the city. I\r\nshall find a means of escape,” said Têng.\r\n\r\n“His family is here and he has many friends. How about them?”\r\n\r\n“I also have a scheme to settle them.”\r\n\r\nThen he went to see Lü Pu, to whom he said, “Hsüchou is surrounded and\r\nthis city will be fiercely attacked. We ought to provide for possible\r\nretreat and I advise storing grain and money in Hsiaopʻei. We could\r\nretreat there if the day went adversely. Why not see about this in good\r\ntime?”\r\n\r\n“Your words are indeed wise. I will also send my wife and little ones\r\nthither,” said Lü.\r\n\r\nThe family left under escort and with them was sent much grain and\r\nsilver. And then the soldiers marched to the relief of the pass. About\r\nhalf way there Chʻên Têng said, “Let me go first to reconnoitre so that\r\nyou, my lord, may advance with confidence.”\r\n\r\nThus Chʻên Têng parted company with his chief and preceded him to the\r\npass where he was received by Chʻên Kung. He said, “The Marquis greatly\r\nwonders why you do not advance. He is going to enquire into it.”\r\n\r\n“The enemy is in great force and we cannot be too careful,” said Kung.\r\n“We are holding the pass and you should persuade our master to take\r\nsteps to guard Pʻeichʻêng.”\r\n\r\nChʻên Têng muttered to himself and said no more. That evening he went\r\nup to the heights from which he could see Tsʻao’s army, which was quite\r\nclose to the pass. Then he wrote three notes, tied them to arrows and\r\nshot them into Tsʻao’s camp.\r\n\r\nNext day he left and hastened back to Lü Pu. “Those bandits are about\r\nto give up the pass to the enemy, but I have left Chʻên Kung to hold\r\nit. You had better make an attack to-night and hold him.”\r\n\r\n“Had it not been for you the pass would have been lost,” said Lü.\r\n\r\nThen he sent Chʻên Têng back to arrange a signal with Chʻên Kung for\r\nsimultaneous action. So Têng returned to Kung to whom he said, “Tsʻao’s\r\nmen have found a secret way through the pass and I fear Hsüchou is\r\nalready lost. You ought to go back at once.”\r\n\r\nAt this the pass was abandoned and Kung began to retreat. Then the\r\nprearranged signal was given.\r\n\r\nLü Pu advanced in the darkness to the relief of the pass. Presently he\r\nmet Chʻên Kun’s men, and as neither recognised the other in the\r\ndarkness a fierce battle ensued. Nor was the trick discovered till\r\ndaylight came.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were going on Tsʻao Tsʻao had noted the signal and\r\nadvanced as fast as possible. The bandits, who alone remained to hold\r\nthe pass, were easily driven out and scattered in all directions.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight came and the trick was discovered Lü Pu and Chʻên Kung\r\nset off together for Hsüchou. But when they arrived and summoned the\r\ngate, instead of opening the doors the men on the wall saluted them\r\nwith a thick flight of arrows. At the same time Mi Chu appeared on the\r\ndefence tower and shouted, “You stole our master’s city and now we are\r\ngoing to give it back to him. You will not enter here again.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Chʻên Kuei?” cried Lü Pu, angrily.\r\n\r\n“We have slain him,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Where is that son of his?” said Pu turning to Chʻên Kung.\r\n\r\n“Do you still hold to your delusion, General, that you ask where this\r\nspecious rogue is?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu bade them search through all the ranks, but he was not to be\r\nfound. Then they decided to go to Hsiaopʻei. But ere they had got half\r\nway there suddenly appeared the troops under the command of Kao Shun\r\nand Chang Liao. They said Chʻên Têng had come to them saying their lord\r\nwas surrounded and wanted help so they had come at once.\r\n\r\n“Another trick of that false rogue!” said Lü Pu. “Surely he shall die\r\nfor this.”\r\n\r\nThey went with all speed to the city, only to see as they drew near the\r\nensigns of the enemy displayed all along the walls, for the city had\r\nbeen taken by Tsʻao Jên.\r\n\r\nWhile Lü Pu stood at the foot of the rampart reviling the traitor Chʻên\r\nTêng, Têng himself appeared on the wall and pointing to Lü Pu cried,\r\n“Did you think that I, a Minister of the Dynasty, would serve a rebel\r\nlike you?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu in his wrath was about to make a desperate attack but suddenly a\r\ngreat noise was heard and an army came up behind him. It was led by no\r\nother than Chang Fei.\r\n\r\nKao Shun went to engage him, but he had no chance of success. Lü Pu\r\nthen joined in the fray. Then another army appeared, and the leader\r\nthis time was Tsʻao Tsʻao himself, and his army rushed to the attack.\r\nSeeing that he had no hope of victory Lü Pu went away toward the east,\r\nwith Tsʻao Tsʻao in pursuit. His army marched till they were worn out.\r\nThen appeared a new force under Kuan Yü. Holding his sword ready to\r\nstrike he called out, “Do not flee, O Lü Pu, Kuan Yü is waiting for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu joined battle; he was flurried and scarce knew what was\r\nhappening. And soon Chang Fei came up once more. By desperate efforts\r\nLü Pu and his men cut their way through the press and got free. After\r\nthis they started for Hsiaopʻei as fast as they could travel and Hou\r\nChʻêng helped to keep the pursuers at bay.\r\n\r\nSo the two brothers Kuan Yü and Chang Fei were together again after\r\ntheir separation. Both shed tears of joy as they told each other what\r\nthey had seen and suffered.\r\n\r\n“I was on the Haichow road when I heard of you,” said Yün-chʻang. “I\r\nlost no time in starting.”\r\n\r\n“And I had been camped in the Mangtang Hills for a long time. It is\r\nhappiness to be together again.”\r\n\r\nSo they talked. Then they marched off together to find their elder\r\nbrother, and made their salutations with tears. In Yüan-tê’s heart\r\nsadness and joy intermingled. Next they were presented to Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nand with him they went into the captured city.\r\n\r\nMi Chu soon came with the welcome news of the safety of the family. And\r\nthe two Chʻên’s, betrayers of Lü Pu, came to present their salutations.\r\nA grand banquet was prepared for the officers at which Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\npresided as host and Chʻên Kuei and Yüan-tê occupied the seats of\r\nhonour. At the close of the banquet Tsʻao Tsʻao paid the two Chʻêns the\r\nhighest compliments on their success and rewarded them with the\r\nrevenues of ten departments beside giving the son the title of Fu-po\r\nChang-chün or General, “Queller of Waves.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was very pleased with his success and at once began to\r\nscheme for the taking of Hsiaopʻei, the sole place now left to Lü Pu,\r\nwhere he had taken refuge. Chʻêng Yü said the course was inadvisable.\r\n\r\n“If Lü Pu be pressed too hard he may get clear by a desperate effort\r\nand throw himself into the arms of our especial enemy Yüan Shu. These\r\ntwo as allies would be difficult to overcome. Rather send a capable man\r\nto guard Huainan, one able to secure you against Lü Pu on one hand and\r\nto hold Yüan Shu on the other. Moreover the bandits are in Shantung and\r\nstill our enemies. They must be watched.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “I can keep the whole of Shantung and I will request\r\nYüan-tê to take the south.”\r\n\r\n“Could I dare withstand your command?” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSo forthwith Liu Pei, leaving Mi Chu and Chien Yung at Hsüchou, went\r\nsouth, taking in his train his brothers and Sun Chʻien. And Tsʻao led\r\nhis army to Hsiaopʻei.\r\n\r\nLü Pu felt very secure in his refuge. He had good store of grain and he\r\nhad the protection of the river, so he sat quiet, satisfied that he\r\ncould maintain his defence. So he allowed Tsʻao’s army to approach\r\nwithout molestation.\r\n\r\n“You ought to attack Tsʻao’s army as they come up before they have time\r\nto make camps and defences. They will only have fatigued men to oppose\r\nto your fresh troops and you will certainly defeat them.”\r\n\r\nSo said Chʻên Kung but Lü Pu replied, “I have suffered too many defeats\r\nlately to take any risk. Wait till they actually attack and you will\r\nsee them floating away on the waters.”\r\n\r\nSo he neglected the confidant’s advice and waited till the enemy had\r\nsettled into their camp. This done, the attackers advanced against the\r\ncity. From the foot of the wall Tsʻao Tsʻao called to Lü Pu to listen\r\nwhile he spoke. Lü Pu ascended to the wall where he stood.\r\n\r\nTsʻao addressed him, saying, “When I heard that your family and that of\r\nYüan Shu were likely to be united by marriage I sent an army against\r\nyou, for Yüan was guilty of treason while you had to your credit the\r\ndestruction of Tung Cho. For what reason have you sacrificed all your\r\nmerits to throw in your lot with a rebel? It will be over late to\r\nregret when this city shall have fallen. But if you surrender and help\r\nme to support the ruling house you shall not lose your rank of\r\nMarquis.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu replied, “If the Minister will retire we may be able to discuss\r\nthe matter.”\r\n\r\nBut Chʻên Kung, standing near his master, began to rail at Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nfor a rebel and shot an arrow that struck his plumed helmet.\r\n\r\n“My oath, but I will slay you at least!” cried Tsʻao, pointing his\r\nfinger at Chʻên Kung.\r\n\r\nThen the attack on the walls began.\r\n\r\n“They have come from far and cannot maintain this for long,” said Chʻên\r\nKung. “General, go out with your horse and foot and take up a position\r\noutside, leaving me to maintain the defence with the remainder of our\r\nmen. If he engages you, I will come out and strike at his rear ranks;\r\nif he attacks the city, you can come to our aid. In a few days their\r\nstores will fail and we can beat them off. This will place them between\r\nthe horns.”\r\n\r\n“The advice seems good,” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his palace and prepared his weapons. As it was the\r\ndepth of winter he made his men take plenty of wadded clothing to keep\r\nthem warm. His wife heard of it and came to ask whither he was going.\r\nHe told her of Chʻên Kung’s plan.\r\n\r\nShe said, “My lord, you are leaving an undamaged city, abandoning your\r\nwife and little ones and going with a paltry force. Should any untoward\r\nevent happen will your handmaid and her lord ever meet again?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu hesitated, and for three days made no move. Then Chʻên Kung came\r\nto see him again and said, “The enemy are all round the city and unless\r\nyou go out soon you will be quite hemmed in.”\r\n\r\n“I am thinking it would be better to maintain a stubborn defence,” said\r\nLü.\r\n\r\n“Our enemies are short of food and have sent for supplies to Hsütu.\r\nThese will soon arrive and you should go out with some veterans and\r\nintercept the convoy. That loss would be a heavy blow.”\r\n\r\nLü Pu agreed and went in to tell his wife the new plan. She wept\r\nsaying, “If you go do you think those others equal to the defence of\r\nthe city? Should anything go wrong you would be very sorry. You\r\nabandoned me at Chʻangan and it was only through the fortunate kindness\r\nof Pʻang Hsü that I was hidden from our enemies and rejoined you. Who\r\nwould have thought you would leave me again? But go, go your way as far\r\nas you wish, and do not mind your wife?”\r\n\r\nAnd she wept bitterly. Lü Pu very sadly went to take leave of Little\r\nCicada who said, “You are my lord, you must not be careless and ride\r\nout alone.”\r\n\r\n“You need not fear; with my mighty halberd and the Hare, my swift\r\nsteed, who dare come near me?”\r\n\r\nHe went out. He met Chʻên Kung and said, “That story about supplies for\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao is all false, one of his many ruses. I am not going to\r\nstir.”\r\n\r\nChʻên Kung sighed; he felt all was lost.\r\n\r\n“We shall die and no man shall know our burying place,” said he.\r\n\r\nThereupon Lü Pu remained in his own quarters with his women folk,\r\ndrinking freely to dissipate his sorrows. Two of his advisers went in\r\nand proposed that he should write to the powerful Yüan Shu for help.\r\nYüan would hardly refuse to rescue the affianced bride of his son. So\r\nhe wrote and bade these two take the letter.\r\n\r\nHsü Ssŭ said, “You ought to send a strong escort with us to force a way\r\nthrough.”\r\n\r\nSo Lü told off a company and two captains to conduct his messenger\r\nbeyond the pass. They started that same night at the second watch,\r\nChang Liao leading and Ho Ming bringing up the rear. They got out of\r\nthe city, crept past Yüan-tê’s camp and got beyond the danger zone.\r\nThen half the escort went on and Chang Liao led the remainder back\r\ntoward the city. At the pass he found Yün-chʻang waiting. However, at\r\nthat moment Kao Shun came to his help and they all returned and\r\nre-entered the gates.\r\n\r\nThe two messengers presently reached Shouchʻun, saw Yüan Shu and\r\npresented the letter.\r\n\r\n“How is this?” said Shu. “Formerly he slew my messenger and repudiated\r\nthe marriage; now he sends to ask for it.”\r\n\r\n“It is all due to the vile plans of that monster Tsʻao Tsʻao. I pray\r\nyou, Illustrious Sir, to consider it carefully,” replied Ssŭ.\r\n\r\n“But if your master was not hemmed in by his enemy and in imminent\r\ndanger he would never have thought of renewing this proposal of\r\nmarriage.”\r\n\r\nThe messengers said, “You may decide not to help him, but the teeth are\r\ncold when the lips are gone. It will not make for your happiness and\r\ncomfort.”\r\n\r\nSaid Shu, “Fêng-hsien is unreliable; tell him that I will send soldiers\r\nafter the girl has arrived here.”\r\n\r\nThis was final and the two messengers took leave. When the party\r\nreached Yüan-tê’s camp they decided to try to get through in the\r\ndarkness, the escort remaining behind to protect their rear. They tried\r\nthat very night and the two messengers crept across without discovery.\r\nBut the escort found themselves faced by Chang Fei. Ho Ming tried to\r\nfight but was captured in the very first bout and the men of his half\r\ncompany were either killed or they fled.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was taken to Yüan-tê, who forwarded him to the main camp.\r\nThere he told the story of the marriage and the scheme to save the\r\ncity. Tsʻao Tsʻao was angry and ordered the execution of the prisoner\r\nat the main gate.\r\n\r\nThen he sent orders to each camp to exercise the greatest diligence\r\nwith threats of rigorous punishment of the officers of any corps that\r\npermitted any communication between the besieged and the outer world.\r\n\r\nEvery soldier felt mightily afraid. Yüan-tê returned to camp and\r\ncautioned his brothers saying, “We are in the most important place with\r\nregard to Huainan and you must be very careful not to allow any breach\r\nof this command.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei was inclined to grumble, “We have just captured one of the\r\nenemy’s leaders,” said he, “and there is no word of praise or reward\r\nfor us; nothing but new orders and threats. What do you make of that?”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong to complain,” said Yüan-tê. “These are orders of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and what would happen were there no orders? Do not\r\ndisobey them, brother.”\r\n\r\nThey promised obedience and withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the messengers had got back to Lü Pu and told him what\r\nYüan Shu had said, that if the girl came the soldiers should go.\r\n\r\n“But how can she be sent?” said Pu.\r\n\r\n“That is the difficulty. Ho Ming’s capture means that Tsʻao Tsʻao knows\r\nthe whole plan of getting help from the south. I do not see how any one\r\nbut you yourself could hope to get through the close siege.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we tried, to-day?” said Lü Pu.\r\n\r\n“This is an ill-omened day; you must not try to-day. To-morrow is a\r\nvery lucky day, especially in the evening, for any military action.”\r\n\r\nThen Lü Pu ordered Chang Liao and Kao Shun to get ready three companies\r\nfor the venture and to prepare a light carriage. He would lead till\r\nthey had got a couple of hundred li away. Thence they could escort the\r\nbride-elect the remainder of the way to her new home.\r\n\r\nNext evening toward the second watch Lü Pu wrapped up his daughter in\r\nsoft wadded garments, bound her about with a mailed coat and took her\r\non his back. Then with his mighty halberd in hand, he mounted his steed\r\nand rode at the head of the cavalcade out of the city gate. The two\r\ncaptains followed.\r\n\r\nIn this order they approached Yüan-tê’s camp. The drums at once beat\r\nthe alarm and the two younger brothers barred the way.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” they shouted.\r\n\r\nLü Pu had no desire to fight; all he wished was to get through so he\r\nmade for a side road. Yüan-tê came in pursuit and the two parties\r\nengaged. Brave as he might be, Lü Pu was almost helpless now that he\r\nwas hampered by a girl on his shoulders, whom he was desperately\r\nanxious to preserve from hurt. Beside other parties came up all\r\nshouting and attacking and he had no alternative but to give up his\r\nproject and return into the city. He reached his palace very sad at\r\nheart. The besiegers returned to camp well pleased that no one had got\r\nbeyond their lines.\r\n\r\nLü Pu found consolation in the wine cup. The siege had gone on for two\r\nmonths and still the city stood, when they heard that Chang Yang,\r\nPrefect of Honei, had been inclined to come to the help of Lü Pu. But\r\none of his subordinates had assassinated him and was bringing his head\r\nas an offering to Tsʻao Tsʻao, when he also had been slain by one of\r\nthe Prefect’s friends. He had then gone to Tachʻêng.\r\n\r\nIn the camp of the besiegers there now arose much murmuring. The\r\nofficers grumbled saying, “Though Chang Yang, who meant to hurt us, is\r\nhappily no more, yet we are threatened on the north by Yüan Shao and on\r\nthe east Piao Hsiu is a menace. Here we meet with no success against\r\nthe city. We are for leaving Lü Pu to his fate and returning home. We\r\nneed a rest.”\r\n\r\nAmong them Hsün Yü fought against this discontent. “You must not act\r\nlike this,” said he. “Lü Pu has lost much and his spirit is broken. The\r\nspirit of the leader expresses that of his men, and when the leader\r\nfails his men do not fight. Chʻên Kung is clever but nothing is done.\r\nLü Pu broken, Chʻên Kung without decision, it only needs a sharp attack\r\nand we shall succeed.”\r\n\r\n“I have a plan to propose,” said Kuo Chia, “a plan to overcome the city\r\nat once; it beats twenty legions.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you mean drowning the city,” said Hsün Yü.\r\n\r\n“That is it,” said the proposer, smiling.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao accepted the suggestion with joy and set his men to cut the\r\nbanks of the I and Ssŭ Rivers, and moved his men to the high ground\r\nwhence they watched the drowning out of Hsiaopʻei. Only the east gate\r\nremained clear of water.\r\n\r\nThe besieged soldiers hastened to their leader. He said, “Why should I\r\nfear? My good horse can go as well through the water as over the land.”\r\nAnd he again returned to the wine cup for consolation, drinking deeply\r\nwith his wife and concubine.\r\n\r\nThe continual drinking bouts told at last and Lü Pu began to look\r\ndissipated. Seeing himself in a mirror one day he was startled at the\r\nchange and said to himself, “I am injuring myself with wine; no more\r\nfrom this day forward.”\r\n\r\nHe then issued an order that no one should drink wine under penalty of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nNow one of his captains, Hou Chʻêng, lost fifteen horses, stolen by one\r\nHou Tsʻao, who intended them for Yüan-tê. The owner found out where\r\nthey were, went out after them and recovered them. And his colleagues\r\ncongratulated him on his success. To celebrate the occasion he brewed a\r\nfew catties of wine to be drunk at the feast, but thinking his chief\r\nmight find him in fault he sent the bottles of wine to his palace with\r\na petition explaining that by virtue of his lord’s warlike renown he\r\nhad recovered his horses and asking that he and his comrades might be\r\nallowed a little wine at their feast.\r\n\r\nLü Pu took it very angrily saying, “When I have forbidden all wine you\r\nbrew some and begin to give feasts; you are simply defying me.”\r\nWhereupon he ordered the officer to instant execution. However, a\r\nnumber of his colleagues came in and interceded and after a time Lü Pu\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\n“You ought to lose your head for this disobedience, but for the sake of\r\nyour colleagues the punishment shall be reduced to a hundred strokes.”\r\n\r\nThey tried to beg him off this, but only succeeded in reducing the\r\nnumber of blows to one half.\r\n\r\nWhen the sentence had been carried out and the offender was permitted\r\nto return home his colleagues came sadly to console him.\r\n\r\n“Had it not been for you I should have been put to death,” said Hou\r\nChʻêng.\r\n\r\nSung Hsien replied, “All he cares for is his family, there is no pity\r\nfor any one else. We are no more than the weeds by the roadside.”\r\n\r\nWei Hsü said, “The city is besieged, the water is drowning us out.\r\nThere will not be much more of this for we may die any day.”\r\n\r\n“He is a beast, with neither a sense of humanity nor of right. Let us\r\nleave him,” said Hsien.\r\n\r\n“He is not worth fighting for. The best we could do would be to seize\r\nhim and hand him over to Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“I was punished because I got my horses back again, yet all he trusts\r\nin is his own steed. If you two will betray the gate and seize Lü Pu I\r\nwill steal the horse and go out to Tsʻao’s camp.”\r\n\r\nThey settled how to carry out the plot and that very night Hou Chʻêng\r\nsneaked into the stables and got the Hare away. He hastened to the east\r\ngate which was opened to let him through. The guard made a pretence of\r\npursuing him but only a pretence.\r\n\r\nHou Chʻêng reached the besiegers’ camp, presented the horse and told\r\nTsʻao what had been arranged. They would show a white flag and open the\r\ngates to his army. Hearing this Tsʻao had a few notifications written\r\nout, which were attached to arrows and shot over the walls. This is one\r\nof them:—“The General Tsʻao Tsʻao has received a command to destroy Lü\r\nPu. Those who interfere with the operations of his grand army, whatever\r\ntheir rank, shall be put to death in the gate on the day that the city\r\nshall be captured. Should any one capture Lü Pu or bring his head he\r\nshall be well rewarded. Let all take note of this.”\r\n\r\nNext day at daylight a tremendous hubbub was heard without the city and\r\nLü Pu, halberd in hand, hasted to the wall to see what it meant. As he\r\nwent from gate to gate inspecting the defences and guards he censured\r\nWei Hsü for letting Hou Chʻêng escape and get away with his horse. He\r\nthreatened to punish him. But just then the besiegers began a fierce\r\nattack as the white flag had just appeared and Lü Pu had to turn all\r\nhis energies to defence. The assault lasted till noon, when the\r\nattacking force drew off for a time.\r\n\r\nLü Pu was taking a rest in the tower and fell asleep in his chair. Sun\r\nHsien sent away his attendants, and when they had gone he stole his\r\nmaster’s weapon, the halberd in which he trusted. Then he and Wei Hsü\r\nfell upon Lü together and before he was well awake had bound him with\r\ncords, trussing him so that he could not move. Lü Pu shouted for his\r\nmen, but they were driven off by the two traitors and could not come\r\nnear. Then a white flag was shown and the besiegers again approached\r\nthe city. The traitors shouted out that Lü Pu was a prisoner. But\r\nHsiahou Yüan could hardly believe it till they threw down the famous\r\nhalberd.\r\n\r\nThe gates were flung open and the enemy entered the city. Kao Shun and\r\nChang Liao, who were at the opposite gate, were surrounded and cut off\r\nby the water and helpless. They were captured. Chʻên Kung made a dash\r\nto the south gate but was also taken. Presently Tsʻao Tsʻao entered and\r\nat once gave orders to turn the streams back into their usual courses.\r\nHe put out proclamations soothing the people.\r\n\r\nHe and Liu Pei seated themselves side by side in the White Gate Tower,\r\nwith Kuan Yü and Chang Fei in attendance. The captives, to the number\r\nof a thousand, were brought before them. Lü Pu looked a pitiable\r\nobject. Although a very tall man he was tied up in a veritable ball.\r\n\r\n“The bonds are very tight,” cried he, “I beseech you to loosen them.”\r\n\r\n“A bound tiger frets of course,” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nSeeing the three traitors standing there looking pleased at their\r\nsuccess Pu said, “I treated you all well enough; how could you turn\r\nagainst me?”\r\n\r\nSaid Sung Hsien, “You listened to the words of your women, but rejected\r\nthe advice of your captains. Was not that mean?”\r\n\r\nLü Pu was silent. Then Kao Shun was brought forward.\r\n\r\n“What have you to say?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nShun sulkily held his tongue and was ordered out to execution.\r\n\r\nNext Chʻên Kung was led in.\r\n\r\n“I hope you have been well since we last saw each other, Kungtʻai?”\r\nsaid Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Your ways were crooked and so I left you,” said Chʻên.\r\n\r\n“You say I was crooked; and what of your serving Lü Pu?”\r\n\r\n“Though he was a fool, he did not resemble you in deceit and\r\nwickedness.”\r\n\r\n“You say you are able enough and clever, but what about your position\r\nto-day?”\r\n\r\nTurning toward Lü Pu, Chʻên Kung said, “This man would not follow my\r\nadvice. Had he done so he would not now be a captive.”\r\n\r\n“What think you ought to be done about this day’s work?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“There is death for me to-day and that is the end,” shouted Chʻên Kung.\r\n\r\n“Very well for you; but what of your mother and your wife?”\r\n\r\n“It is said that he who rules with due regard to filial piety does not\r\nharm a man’s family; he who would show benevolence does not cut off the\r\nsacrifices at a man’s tomb. My mother and my wife are in your hands.\r\nBut since I am your prisoner I pray you to slay me quickly and not to\r\ntry to harrow my feelings.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s heart still leaned toward mercy, but Chʻên Kung turned and\r\nwalked away, repulsing the attendants who would stop him. Tsʻao rose\r\nfrom his place and walked with him, the tears falling from his eyes.\r\nChʻên Kung never looked at him. Turning to his men Tsʻao said, “Let his\r\nmother and family be taken to Hsütu and looked after. This insolent\r\nfellow must die.”\r\n\r\nThe condemned man heard him but uttered no word. He stretched out his\r\nneck for the blow. Tears sprang to the eyes of all present. His remains\r\nwere honourably coffined and buried in Hsütu.\r\n\r\nA poem pitying his fate says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Neither hope of life nor fear of death moved him.\r\n        How brave was he, a hero indeed!\r\n        But his lord heeded not his words,\r\n        Wherefore in vain possessed he great talents.\r\n        Nevertheless, in that he stood by his master,\r\n        To parting with wife and mother,\r\n        He merits our pity and profound respect.\r\n        Who would not resemble Kung-tʻai\r\n        That day he died at the White Gate?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Tsʻao sadly escorted Chʻên Kung on the way to death, Lü Pu\r\nappealed to Yüan-tê, “Noble Sir, you sit there an honoured guest while\r\npoor I lie bound at your feet. Will you not utter one word to alleviate\r\nmy lot?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê nodded. As Tsʻao Tsʻao returned to his place his prisoner\r\ncalled out, “Your only trouble, Illustrious Sir, is myself and I am on\r\nyour side now. You take the lead, I will help you and together the\r\nworld is at our feet.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think?” said Tsʻao turning to Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“You are willing to forget the episodes of Ting Yüan and Tung Cho?”\r\n\r\n“Truly the lout is not to be trusted,” said Lü Pu, looking at Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“Strangle and expose,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nAs he was led away the prisoner turned once more to Yüan-tê, “You\r\nlong-eared lout, you forget now the service I rendered you that day at\r\nmy yamên gate, when my arrow hit the mark.”\r\n\r\nJust then some one shouted, “Lü Pu, O fool! death is but death, and why\r\nare you scared at it?”\r\n\r\nEvery one turned to look; the lictors were hustling Chang Liao to the\r\nplace of judgement.\r\n\r\nA poet has written upon the death of Lü Pu:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        The flood spreads wide, the city drowns,\r\n        Its lord is captive. Nought avails\r\n        His courser’s speed or halberd’s thrust.\r\n        The tiger erstwhile fierce, now whines\r\n        For mercy. Tsʻao had meted him\r\n        Full well, a falcon flown at will\r\n        And hungry kept. Poor fool! He let\r\n        Chʻên Kung’s advice be overborne\r\n        By harem tattle; vainly now\r\n        He rails against the Long-eared Childe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd another poem says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bound is the hungry tiger, eater of men, for whom is no pity,\r\n    Since the blood of his victims is fresh and not yet dry.\r\n    Yüan-tê spoke no word in favour of Lü Pu,\r\n    To whom even a father’s life was not sacred.\r\n    How could he save him to be a menace to Tsʻao Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was recorded earlier that the executioners were hustling Chang Liao\r\nforward. Pointing to him as he stood there Tsʻao said, “He has a fine\r\nface.”\r\n\r\n“You were not likely to forget me; you saw me before in Pʻuyang,” said\r\nLiao.\r\n\r\n“O, so you remember me, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; more’s the pity.”\r\n\r\n“Pity for what?”\r\n\r\n“That the fire that day was not fierce enough to burn you up, rebel\r\nthat you are.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao began to get angry. “How dare you insult me?” cried he and lifted\r\nhis sword to kill the bold speaker.\r\n\r\nThe undaunted Chang Liao never changed colour, but stretched out his\r\nneck for the blow. Then a man behind Tsʻao Tsʻao caught his arm and in\r\nfront of him another dropped on his knees, saying, “O Minister, I pray\r\nthee stay thy hand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Lü Pu whining was not spared,\r\n        Railing Chang far better fared.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was it that saved Chang Liao? The next chapter will show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO A-MAN ORGANISES A HUNTING EXPEDITION:\r\nTUNG, “STATE UNCLE,” RECEIVES A COMMAND IN THE PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter said that Tsʻao Tsʻao was checked in his angry attack\r\nupon Chang Liao. It was Liu Pei who held his arm and Kuan Yün-chʻang\r\nwho knelt before him.\r\n\r\n“A man as generous-hearted as he is should be saved,” said Liu.\r\n\r\nKuan said, “I know him well as loyal and righteous. I will vouch for\r\nhim with my own life.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao threw aside his sword. “I also know Wên-yüan to be loyal and\r\ngood; I was just testing him,” said he.\r\n\r\nHe loosed the prisoner’s bonds with his own hands, had a change of\r\ndress brought in and clothed him therewith. Then he was led to a seat\r\nof honour. This kindly treatment sank deep into Chang’s heart and he\r\nhastened to declare formally that he yielded. And then he was given a\r\nrank and the title of marquis. He was sent on a mission to win over\r\nTsang Pa, who hearing what had happened, came forthwith and gave in his\r\nsubmission. He was graciously received and his former colleagues also\r\nyielded, with the exception of Chang Hsi, who remained obdurate. All\r\nthese former enemies who came over were kindly treated and given posts\r\nof responsibility wherein they might prove the reality of their\r\nconversion. Lü Pu’s family were sent to the capital.\r\n\r\nAfter the soldiers had been rewarded with feastings the camp was broken\r\nup and the army moved away to Hsütu. Passing through Hsüchou the people\r\nlined the roads and burned incense in honour of the victors. They also\r\npetitioned that Liu Pei should be their governor.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao replied, “Liu Shih-chün has rendered great services. You\r\nmust wait till he has been received in audience and obtained his\r\nreward. After that he shall be sent here.”\r\n\r\nChʻê Chou, a General of Cavalry, was given command of Hsüchou for the\r\nmoment. After the army had arrived at the capital rewards were granted\r\nto all the officers who had been in the expedition. Liu Yüan-tê was\r\nretained in the capital, lodging in an annexe to the Minister’s palace.\r\nSoon after a Court was held and Tsʻao Tsʻao represented the services of\r\nYüan-tê who was presented to the Emperor Hsien. Dressed in Court robes\r\nhe bowed at the lower end of the audience arena. The Emperor called him\r\nto the Hall and asked his ancestry.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “Thy servant is the son of Liu Hung, grandson of Liu\r\nHsiung, who was a direct descendant of Prince Ching of Chungshan, who\r\nwas the great-great-grandson of His Majesty the Emperor Ching (about\r\n150 B.C.)”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor bade them bring forth the Books of the Genealogies and\r\ntherefrom a secretary read: “The filial Emperor Ching begat fourteen\r\nsons of whom the seventh was Liu Shêng, Prince Ching of Chungshan.\r\nShêng begat Chên, Marquis (Tʻing-hou) of Luchʻêng; Chên begat Ang,\r\nMarquis Pʻei; Ang begat Lu, Marquis Chang; Lu begat Lien, Marquis of\r\nIshui; Lien begat Ying, Marquis of Chʻinyang; Ying begat Chien, Marquis\r\nAnkuo; Chien begat Ai, Marquis Kuanglu; Ai begat Hsien, Marquis of\r\nChiaoshui; Hsien begat Hsü, Marquis of Tsuyi; Hsü begat I, Marquis of\r\nChʻiyang; I begat Pi, Marquis of Yüantsê; Pi begat Ta, Marquis of\r\nYingchʻuan; Ta begat Pu-i, Marquis of Fêngling; Pu-i begat Hui, Marquis\r\nof Chichʻuan; Hui begat Hsiung, Governor of the Eastern Districts;\r\nHsiung begat Hung, who held no office or rank and Liu Pei is his son.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor compared this with the registers of the Imperial House and\r\nfound by them that Liu Pei was his uncle by descent. He seemed greatly\r\npleased and requested Liu Pei to go into one of the side chambers where\r\nhe might perform the ceremonial obeisance prescribed for a nephew to\r\nhis uncle. In his heart he rejoiced to have this heroic warrior-uncle\r\nas a powerful supporter against Tsʻao Tsʻao who really held all the\r\npower in his own hands. The Emperor knew himself to be a mere puppet.\r\nHe conferred upon his uncle, the rank of General and the title of\r\nMarquis of Ichʻêng.\r\n\r\nWhen the banquet was concluded Yüan-tê thanked the Emperor and went out\r\nof the palace. And from this time he was very generally styled Liu,\r\n“Uncle of the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao returned to his palace Hsün Yü and his fellow advisers\r\nwent in to see him. Hsün Yü said, “It is no advantage to you,\r\nIllustrious Sir, that the Emperor recognises Liu as an uncle.”\r\n\r\n“He may be recognised as uncle, but he is under my orders since I\r\ncontrol the decrees of the throne. He will be all the more ready to\r\nobey. Beside I will keep him here under the pretence of having him near\r\nhis sovereign and he will be entirely in my hands. I have nothing to\r\nfear. The man I fear is Yang Piao, who is a relative of the two Yüans.\r\nShould Yang conspire with them he is an enemy within and might do much\r\nharm. He will have to be removed.”\r\n\r\nHence Tsʻao sent a secret emissary to say that Yang Piao was intriguing\r\nwith Yüan Shu and on this charge Piao was arrested and imprisoned. And\r\nhis death would have been compassed had his enemy dared.\r\n\r\nBut just then the Prefect of Pohai, Kʻung Jung, was at the capital and\r\nhe remonstrated with Tsʻao Tsʻao saying, “Yang comes from a family\r\nfamed for virtue for at least four generations; you cannot trump up so\r\nfoolish a charge as that against him.”\r\n\r\n“It is the Court,” retorted Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“If Prince Chʻêng had put Duke Chao to death, could Duke Chou have\r\npretended ignorance?”\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao had to relinquish the attempt, but he took away Yang’s offices\r\nand banished him to his family estate in the country.\r\n\r\nA certain Chao Yen, a minor official but an opponent of the Minister,\r\nsent up a memorial impeaching Tsʻao for having removed a Minister of\r\nState from office without a decree. Tsʻao’s reply to this was the\r\narrest of Chao and his execution, a bold stroke which terrified the\r\nbulk of officers and reduced them to silence.\r\n\r\nChʻêng Yü advised Tsʻao to assume a more definite position. He said,\r\n“Illustrious Sir, your prestige grows daily; why not seize the\r\nopportunity to take the position of Chief of the Feudatory Princes?”\r\n\r\n“There are still too many supporters of the Court,” was the reply. “I\r\nmust be careful. I am going to propose a royal hunt to try to find out\r\nthe best line to follow.”\r\n\r\nThis expedition being decided upon they got together fleet horses,\r\nfamous falcons and pedigree hounds, and prepared bows and arrows in\r\nreadiness. They mustered a strong force of guards outside the city.\r\n\r\nWhen the Minister proposed the hunting expedition the Emperor said he\r\nfeared it was an improper thing to do.\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “In ancient times rulers made four expeditions yearly at\r\neach of the four seasons in order to show their strength. They were\r\ncalled Sou, Miao, Hsien and Shou, in the order of the seasons. Now that\r\nthe whole country is in confusion it would be wise to inaugurate a hunt\r\nin order to train the army. I am sure Your Majesty will approve.”\r\n\r\nSo the Emperor with the full paraphernalia for an Imperial hunt joined\r\nthe expedition. He rode a saddle horse, carried an inlaid bow, and his\r\nquiver was filled with gold-tipped arrows. His chariot followed behind.\r\nThe three brothers were in the Imperial train, each with his bow and\r\nquiver. Each wore a breastplate under the outer robe and held his\r\nespecial weapon, while their escort followed them. Tsʻao Tsʻao rode a\r\ndun horse called “Flying Lightning” and the army was ten legions\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nThe hunt took place in Hsütʻien and the legions spread out as guards\r\nround the hunting arena which extended over some two hundred square li.\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao rode even with the Emperor, the horses’ heads alternating\r\nin the lead. The imperial suite immediately following were all in\r\nTsʻao’s confidence. The other officers, civil and military, lagged\r\nbehind, for who dared press forward into the midst of Tsʻao’s\r\npartizans?\r\n\r\nOne day the Emperor was riding near Hsütʻien and noticed his newly\r\nfound uncle respectfully standing by the roadside.\r\n\r\n“I should like to see my uncle display his hunting skill,” said the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei mounted his steed at once. Just then a hare started from its\r\nform; Yüan-tê shot and hit it with the first arrow.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, much struck by this display, rode away over a slope.\r\nSuddenly a deer broke out of the thicket. He shot three arrows at it\r\nbut all missed.\r\n\r\n“You try,” said the Emperor turning to Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Lend me Your Majesty’s bow,” he replied, and taking the inlaid bow and\r\nthe golden-barbed arrows he pulled the bow and hit the deer in the\r\nshoulder at the first shot. It fell in the grass and could not run.\r\n\r\nNow the crowd of officers seeing the golden-barbed arrow sticking in\r\nthe wound concluded at once that the shot was the Emperor’s, so they\r\nrushed up and shouted “Wansui! O King, live for ever!” Tsʻao Tsʻao rode\r\nout pushing past the Emperor and acknowledged the congratulations.\r\n\r\nThey all turned pale. What did this mean? Liu Pei’s brother Kuan who\r\nwas behind him was especially angry. The sleeping caterpillar eyebrows\r\nstood up fiercely and the red phoenix eyes glared as, sword in hand, he\r\nrode hastily forth to cut down the audacious Minister for his\r\nimpertinence. However, his elder brother hastily waved him back and\r\nshot at him a meaning glance so that he stopped and made no further\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê bowing toward Tsʻao said, “Most sincere felicitations! A truly\r\nsupernatural shot, such as few have achieved!”\r\n\r\n“It is only the enormous good fortune of the Son of Heaven!” said Tsʻao\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nThen he turned his steed and felicitated the Emperor. But he did not\r\nreturn the bow; he hung it over his own shoulder instead.\r\n\r\nThe hunt finished with banqueting and when the entertainments were over\r\nthey returned to the capital, all glad of some repose after the\r\nexpedition. Kuan Yü was still full of the Minister’s breach of decorum.\r\n\r\nOne day he said, “Brother, why did you prevent me from killing that\r\nrebel and so ridding the world of a scoundrel? He insults the Emperor\r\nand ignores everybody else.”\r\n\r\n“When you throw stones at a rat, beware of the vase,” quoted Yüan-tê.\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao was only a horse’s head away from Our Lord and in the\r\nmidst of a crowd of his partizans. In that momentary burst of anger, if\r\nyou had struck and failed, and harm had come to the Emperor, what an\r\nawful crime would have been laid to us!”\r\n\r\n“If we do not rid the world of him to-day, a worse evil will come of\r\nit,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\n“But be discreet, my brother. Such matters cannot be lightly\r\ndiscussed.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor sadly returned to his palace. With tears in his eyes he\r\nrelated what had occurred in the hunt to his consort the Empress Fu.\r\n\r\n“Alas for me!” said he. “From the first days of my accession one\r\nvicious minister has succeeded another. I was the victim of Tung Cho’s\r\nevil machinations; then followed the rebellion of Li Tsʻui and Kuo Ssŭ.\r\nYou and I had to bear sorrows such as no others have borne. Then came\r\nthis Tsʻao Tsʻao as one who would maintain the imperial dignity, but he\r\nhas seized upon all real authority and does as he wishes. He works\r\ncontinually for his own glorification and I never see him but my back\r\npricks. These last few days in the hunting field he went in front of me\r\nand acknowledged the cheers of the crowd. He is so extremely rude that\r\nI feel sure he has sinister designs against me. Alas, my wife, we know\r\nnot when our end may come!”\r\n\r\n“In a whole Court full of nobles who have eaten the bread of Han, is\r\nthere not one who will save his country?” said she.\r\n\r\nThus spake the Empress, and at the same moment there stepped in a man\r\nwho said, “Grieve not, O Imperial Pair! I can find a saviour for the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nAnd who was this? It was none other than the father of the Empress, Fu\r\nWan.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s wanton and perverse behaviour?” said\r\nthe Emperor, drying his eyes.\r\n\r\n“You mean the deer shooting? Who did not see that indeed? But the whole\r\nCourt is full of his clan or his creatures. With the exception of the\r\nrelatives of your Consort there is not one loyal enough to deal with a\r\nrebel. I have no authority and can do nothing, but there is General\r\nTung Chʻêng, the State Uncle, who could do it.”\r\n\r\n“Could Uncle Tung come in to consult about this? I know he has had much\r\nexperience of State troubles.”\r\n\r\nWan replied, “Every one of your attendants is a partizan of Tsʻao’s and\r\nthis sort of thing must be kept most profoundly secret or the\r\nconsequence will be most serious.”\r\n\r\n“Then what can be done?” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“The only plan I can think of is to send gifts of a robe and a jade\r\ngirdle to Tung, and in the lining of the girdle hide a secret edict\r\nauthorising him to take certain steps. When he gets home and has read\r\nthe edict he can elaborate plans as quickly as possible and neither the\r\nspirits above nor the demons below will know anything about them.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor approved and Fu Wan went out. The Emperor then with his own\r\nhand drew up a decree, writing it with blood drawn by biting his\r\nfinger. He gave the document to his consort to sew into the purple\r\nlining of the girdle. When all was done he put on the robe and girded\r\nit with the girdle. Next he bade one of the attendants summon Uncle\r\nTung to the palace.\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng came and after the ceremonies were finished the Emperor\r\nsaid, “A few nights ago I was talking with the Empress of the terrible\r\ndays of the rebellion and we thought of your good services then,\r\ntherefore we have called you in to reward you.”\r\n\r\nThe minister bowed his head in thanks. Then the Emperor led Tung out of\r\nthe Reception Hall to the Tʻai Miao or Temple of Ancestors, and they\r\nwent to the gallery of Worthy Ministers, where the Emperor burned\r\nincense and performed the usual ceremonies. After this they went to see\r\nthe portraits and among them was one of the Founder of the Dynasty, Han\r\nKao-Tsu.\r\n\r\n“Whence sprang our great ancestor and how did he begin his great\r\nachievement?” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty is pleased to joke with thy servant,” said Tung Chʻêng,\r\nrather startled at the question. “Who does not know the deeds of the\r\nSacred Ancestor? He began life as a minor official in Ssŭshang. There\r\ngripping his sword he slew the White Serpent, the beginning of his\r\nstruggle for the right. Speedily he mastered the Empire; in three years\r\nhad destroyed Tsʻin and, in five, also Chʻu. Thus he set up a Dynasty\r\nthat shall endure for ever.”\r\n\r\n“Such heroic forefathers! such weakling descendants! How sad it is!”\r\nsaid the Emperor.\r\n\r\nPointing to the portraits right and left he continued, “Are not these\r\ntwo Chang Liang, Marquis Liu, and Hsiao Ho, Marquis Tsʻuan?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Your great ancestor was greatly assisted by these two.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor glanced right and left. His attendants were rather far\r\naway. Then he whispered to Tung Chʻêng, “You, like these two, must\r\nstand by me.”\r\n\r\n“My poor services are of no worth; I do not compare with those men,”\r\nsaid the Uncle.\r\n\r\n“I remember that you saved me at the western capital. I have never\r\nforgotten and I could never reward you.” Then pointing to his own robe\r\nthe Emperor continued, “You must wear this robe of mine, girded with my\r\nown girdle, and it will be as though you are always near your Emperor.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng bowed his gratitude while the Emperor, taking off the robe,\r\npresented it to his faithful Minister. At the same time he whispered,\r\n“Examine it closely when you get home, and help your Emperor carry out\r\nhis intention.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng understood. He put on the robe and the girdle, took leave\r\nand left the chamber.\r\n\r\nThe news of the audience for Tung Chʻêng had been taken to the\r\nMinister, who at once went to the Palace and arrived as Tung Chʻêng was\r\npassing out at the gate. They met face to face and Tung Chʻêng could in\r\nnowise avoid him. He went to the side of the road and made his\r\nobeisance.\r\n\r\n“Where are you from, State Uncle?” asked Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“His Majesty summoned me into the Palace and has given me this robe and\r\nbeautiful girdle.”\r\n\r\n“Why did he give you these?”\r\n\r\n“He had not forgotten that I saved his life in the old days.”\r\n\r\n“Take it off and let me see it.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng who knew that a secret decree was hidden away somewhere in\r\nthe garments was afraid Tsʻao Tsʻao would notice a breach somewhere in\r\nthe material, so he hesitated and did not obey. But the tyrant called\r\nhis servants. So he took off the girdle. Then Tsʻao looked it over\r\ncarefully. “It certainly is a very handsome girdle,” said he. “Now take\r\noff the robe and let me look at that.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng’s heart was melting with fear but he dared not disobey. So\r\nhe handed over the robe. Tsʻao took it and held it up against the sun\r\nwith his own hand and minutely examined every part of it. When he had\r\ndone this he put it on, girded it with the girdle and turning to his\r\nsuite said, “How is it for length?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful!” they chorussed.\r\n\r\nTurning to Tung Chʻêng he said, “Will you give these to me?”\r\n\r\n“My King’s presents to me I dare not give to another. Let me give you\r\nanother robe in its stead,” said Tung.\r\n\r\n“Is there not some intrigue connected with these presents? I am sure\r\nthere is,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“How could I dare?” said Tung, trembling. “If you are so set upon it\r\nthen I must give it up.”\r\n\r\n“How could I take away what your King has given you? It was all a\r\njoke,” said the Minister.\r\n\r\nHe returned both robe and girdle and their owner made the best of his\r\nway home. When night came and he was alone in his library, he took out\r\nthe robe and looked over every inch of it most carefully. He found\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“He gave me a robe and a girdle and bade me look at them carefully.\r\nThat means there is something to be looked for but I can find no trace\r\nof it. What does it mean?” he soliloquised.\r\n\r\nThen he lifted the girdle and examined that. The jade plates were\r\ncarved into the semblance of small dragons interlaced among flowers.\r\nThe lining was of purple silk. All was sewn together most carefully and\r\nneatly and he could find nothing out of the common. He was puzzled. He\r\nlaid the belt on the table. Presently he picked it up and looked at it\r\nagain. He spent long hours over it but in vain. He leaned over on the\r\nsmall table, his head resting on his hands and was almost asleep, when\r\na candle snuff fell down upon the girdle and burned a hole in the\r\nlining. He hastily shook it off, but the mischief was done: a small\r\nhole had been burned in the silken lining, and through this there\r\nappeared something white with blood red marks. He hastily ripped it\r\nopen and drew out the decree written by the hand of the Emperor himself\r\nin characters of blood.\r\n\r\nIt read, “Of human relationships, that between father and son stands\r\nfirst; of the various social ties that between Prince and Minister\r\nstands highest. To-day Tsʻao Tsʻao, the wicked, is a real tyrant,\r\ntreating even his Prince with indignity. With the support of his\r\nfaction and his army he has destroyed the principles of government. By\r\nconferring rewards and inflicting punishments he has reduced the\r\nEmperor to a nonentity. I have grieved over this day and night. I have\r\nfeared the Empire would be ruined.\r\n\r\n“You are a high Minister of State and my own relative. You must recall\r\nthe difficulties of the great Founder’s early days and draw together\r\nthe loyal and right-minded to destroy this evil faction and restore the\r\nprerogatives of the Throne. Such a deed would be indeed an extreme joy\r\nto the spirits of my ancestors.\r\n\r\n“This decree, written in blood drawn from my own veins, is confided to\r\na noble who is to be most careful not to fail in executing his\r\nEmperor’s design.\r\n\r\n“Given in the era Established Tranquillity, fourth year and the third\r\nmonth of Spring.”\r\n\r\nSo ran the decree and Tung Chʻêng read it with streaming eyes. There\r\nwas no sleep for him that night. Early in the morning he returned to\r\nhis library and re-read it. No plan suggested itself. He laid the\r\ndecree down on the table and sought in the depths of his mind for some\r\nscheme to destroy Tsʻao Tsʻao, but could not decide upon any. And he\r\nfell asleep leaning over his table.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a certain official, Wang Tzŭ-fu, with whom he was on\r\nterms of great intimacy, came to visit him and, as usual, walked into\r\nthe house unannounced and went straight to the library. His host did\r\nnot wake and Wang noticed, hardly hidden by his sleeve, the Emperor’s\r\nwriting. Wondering what this might be he drew it out, read it and put\r\nit in his own sleeve. Then he called out loud, “Uncle Chʻêng, are you\r\nnot well? Why are you asleep at this time of day?”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng started up and at once missed the decree. He was aghast; he\r\nalmost fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n“So you want to make away with Tsʻao Tsʻao? I shall have to tell him,”\r\nsaid Wang.\r\n\r\n“Then, brother, that is the end of the Hans,” said his host, with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n“I was joking,” said Wang. “My forefathers also served the Hans and ate\r\nof their bounty. Am I devoid of loyalty? I would help you, brother, as\r\nfar as lies in my power.”\r\n\r\n“It is well for the country that you think like this,” said Tung.\r\n\r\n“But we ought to have a more private place than this to talk over such\r\nplans and pledge ourselves to sacrifice all in the cause of Han.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng began to feel very satisfied. He produced a roll of white\r\nsilk and wrote his own name at the top and signed it, and Wang followed\r\nsuit. Then the visitor said, “General Wu Tzŭ-lan is one of my best\r\nfriends, he ought to be allowed to come in.”\r\n\r\nChʻêng replied, “Of all the officials of the Court Chʻung Chi and Wu\r\nShih are my best friends. Certainly they would back me up.”\r\n\r\nSo the discussion proceeded. Presently a servant announced no other\r\nthan these very two men.\r\n\r\n“This is providential,” said Tung Chʻêng and he told his friend to hide\r\nbehind a screen.\r\n\r\nThe two guests were led into the library and after the exchange of the\r\nordinary civilities and a cup of tea, Chʻung Chi referred to the\r\nincident at the hunt and the shooting of the stag. “Were you not angry\r\nat that?” said he.\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng answered, “Though we be angry, what can we do?”\r\n\r\nWu Shih struck in, “I would slay this fellow, I swear, but I cannot get\r\nany one to back me up.”\r\n\r\n“Though one should perish for one’s country one should not mind,” said\r\nChʻung Chi.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Wang Tzŭ-fu appeared from behind the screen, saying,\r\n“You two want to kill Tsʻao! I shall have to let him know this. And\r\nUncle Tung is my witness.”\r\n\r\n“A loyal Minister does not mind death. If we are killed we will be Han\r\nghosts, which is better than being sycophants of a traitor.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng said, “We were just saying we wanted to see you two on this\r\nmatter. Wang is only joking.”\r\n\r\nThen he drew forth the decree and showed it to the two new-comers, who\r\nalso wept as they read it. They were asked to add their names.\r\n\r\nTzŭ-fu said, “Wait here a few moments till I get Wu Tzŭ-lan to come.”\r\n\r\nHe left the room and very soon returned with his friend, who also wrote\r\nhis name in the presence of all the others.\r\n\r\nAfter this they went into one of the inner chambers to drink success to\r\nthe new plot. While there a new visitor, Ma Tʻêng, Prefect of Hsiliang,\r\nwas announced.\r\n\r\n“Say I am indisposed,” said the host, “and cannot receive visitors.”\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper took the message, whereat Ma angrily said, “Last night\r\nat the Tunghua Gate I saw him come out in robe and girdle. How can he\r\npretend illness to-day? I am not come from mere idleness, why does he\r\nrefuse to see me?”\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper went in again and told his master what the visitor had\r\nsaid and that he was very angry. Then Chʻêng rose, excused himself\r\nsaying he would soon return, and went to receive Ma Tʻêng. After the\r\nvisitor had saluted and they were both seated, he said, “I have just\r\ncome from a farewell audience and wished to bid you adieu. Why did you\r\nwant to put me off?”\r\n\r\n“My poor body was taken suddenly ill; that is why I was not waiting to\r\nwelcome you,” said Chʻêng.\r\n\r\n“You do not look as if you were ill; your face wears the very bloom of\r\nhealth,” said Tʻêng bluntly.\r\n\r\nHis host could say no more and was silent. The visitor shook out his\r\nsleeves and rose to depart. He sighed deeply as he walked down the\r\nsteps, saying to himself, “Not one of them is any good: there is no one\r\nto save the country.”\r\n\r\nThis speech sank deeply into Tung Chʻêng’s heart. He stopped his guest,\r\nsaying, “Who is no good to save the country? Whom do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“That incident at the hunt the other day, the shooting of the stag,\r\nfilled my breast with anger. But if you, a near relative of the\r\nEmperor, can pass your time in wine and idle dalliance without a\r\nthought of doing away with rebellion, where can any one be found who\r\nwill save the dynasty?”\r\n\r\nHowever, Tung Chʻêng’s doubts were not set at rest. Pretending great\r\nsurprise he replied, “The Minister is of high rank and has the\r\nconfidence of the Court: why then does he utter such things?”\r\n\r\n“So you find that wretch Tsʻao a good man, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Pray speak lower: there are eyes and ears very near us.”\r\n\r\n“The sort of people who covet life and fear death are not those to\r\ndiscuss any great undertaking.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he rose to go away. By this time his host’s doubts were set\r\nat rest: he felt that Ma Tʻêng was loyal and patriotic. So he said, “Do\r\nnot be angry any more. I will show you something.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he invited Ma Tʻêng to go into the room where the others were\r\nseated and then showed him the decree. As Ma read it his hair stood on\r\nend, he ground his teeth and bit his lips till the blood came.\r\n\r\n“When you move, remember the whole force of my army is ready to help,”\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng introduced him to the other conspirators and then the\r\npledge was produced and Ma Tʻêng was told to sign his name. He did so,\r\nat the same time smearing the blood as a sign of the oath and saying,\r\n“I swear to die rather than betray this pledge.”\r\n\r\nPointing to the five he said, “We require ten for this business and we\r\ncan accomplish our design.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot get many true and loyal men. One of the wrong sort will\r\nspoil all,” said Tung Chʻêng.\r\n\r\nMa Tʻêng told them to bring in the list of officials. He read on till\r\nhe came to the name Liu, of the Imperial clan, when clapping his hands\r\nhe cried, “Why not consult him?”\r\n\r\n“Whom?” cried they altogether.\r\n\r\nMa Tʻêng very slowly and deliberately spoke his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n        To a very trusty servant comes an Emperor’s decree,\r\n        And a scion of the ruling house can prove his loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader turns to the next chapter he will see who was Ma Tʻêng’s\r\nhero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO DISCUSSES HEROES:\r\nKUAN YU SLAYS CHʻÊ CHOU.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” was the question on the lips of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nMa Tʻêng’s reply was, “The Governor of Yüchow, Liu Pei. He is here and\r\nwe will ask him to help.”\r\n\r\n“Though he is an uncle of the Emperor, he is at present a partizan of\r\nour enemy, and he will not join.”\r\n\r\n“But I saw something at the hunt,” said Ma Tʻêng. “When Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nadvanced to acknowledge the congratulations due to the Emperor,\r\nYüan-tê’s sworn brother Kuan Yü was behind him, and grasped his sword\r\nas if to cut down Tsʻao Tsʻao. However, Yüan-tê signed to him to hold\r\nhis hand and he did. He would willingly destroy Tsʻao, only he thinks\r\nhis teeth and claws are too many. You must ask him and he will surely\r\nconsent.”\r\n\r\nHere Wu Shih urged caution. “Do not go too fast,” said he. “Let us\r\nconsider the thing most carefully.”\r\n\r\nThey dispersed. Next day after dark Tung Chʻêng went to Liu Pei’s\r\nlodging taking with him the decree. As soon as he was announced Yüan-tê\r\ncame to greet him and led him into a private room where they could talk\r\nfreely. The two younger brothers were there as well.\r\n\r\n“It must be something unusually important that has brought you here\r\nto-night,” said Pei.\r\n\r\n“If I had ridden forth by daylight, Tsʻao might have suspected\r\nsomething so I came by night.”\r\n\r\nWine was brought in and while they were drinking Tung Chʻêng said, “Why\r\ndid you check your brother the other day at the hunt when he was going\r\nto attack Tsʻao Tsʻao?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was startled and said, “How did you know?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody noticed but I saw.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê could not prevaricate and said, “It was the presumption of the\r\nman that made my brother so angry; he could not help it.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor covered his face and wept. “Ah,” said he, “if all the Court\r\nMinisters were like him, there would be no sighs for lack of\r\ntranquillity.”\r\n\r\nNow Yüan-tê felt that possibly Tsʻao Tsʻao had sent his visitor to try\r\nhim, so he cautiously replied, “Where are the sighs for lack of\r\ntranquillity while Tsʻao Tsʻao is at the head of affairs?”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng changed colour and rose from his seat. “You, Sir, are a\r\nrelative of His Majesty and so I showed you my inmost feelings. Why did\r\nyou mislead me?”\r\n\r\n“Because I feared you might be misleading me, and I wanted to find\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nAt this Tung Chʻêng drew out the decree he had received and showed it.\r\nHis host was deeply moved. Then he produced the pledge. There were only\r\nsix names to it and these were Tung Chʻêng, Wang Tzŭ-fu, Chʻung Chi, Wu\r\nShih, Wu Tzŭ-lan and Ma Tʻêng.\r\n\r\n“Since you have a decree like this, I cannot but do my share,” said Liu\r\nPei and at Tung Chʻêng’s request he added his name and signature to the\r\nothers and handed it back.\r\n\r\n“Now let us but get three more, which will make ten, and we shall be\r\nready to act.”\r\n\r\n“But you must move with great caution and not let this get abroad,”\r\nsaid Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nThe two remained talking till an early hour in the morning when the\r\nvisitor left.\r\n\r\nNow in order to put Tsʻao Tsʻao quite off the scent that any plot\r\nagainst him was in progress, Liu Pei began to devote himself to\r\ngardening, planting vegetables and watering them with his own hands.\r\nHis brothers ventured to remonstrate with him for taking to such an\r\noccupation when great matters needed attention.\r\n\r\n“The reason for this you may not know,” replied he. And they said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nOne day when the two brothers were absent and Yüan-tê was busy in his\r\ngarden, two messengers with an escort came from Tsʻao Tsʻao, saying,\r\n“The command of the Minister is that you come at once.”\r\n\r\n“What important affair is afoot?” asked he nervously.\r\n\r\n“We know nothing: we were ordered to come and request your presence.”\r\n\r\nAll he could do was to follow. When he arrived Tsʻao met him and\r\nlaughingly said, “That is a big business you have in hand at home.”\r\n\r\nThis remark made Liu Pei turn the colour of clay. But Tsʻao took him by\r\nthe hand and led him straight to the private garden, saying, “The\r\ngrowth of vegetables that you are trying to learn is very difficult.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê breathed again. He said, “That is hardly a business, it is only\r\na solace.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao said, “I happened to notice the green plums on the trees to-day\r\nand suddenly my thoughts went back to a year ago when we were thrashing\r\nChang Hsiu. We were marching through a parched district and every one\r\nwas suffering from thirst. Suddenly I lifted my whip and pointing at\r\nsomething in the distance I said, “Look at those plum trees.” The\r\nsoldiers heard it and it made their mouths water. Now I owe something\r\nto the plums and we will pay it to-day. I ordered the servants to heat\r\nsome wine very hot and sent to invite you to share it.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was quite composed by this time and no longer suspected any\r\nsinister design. He went with his host to a small summer house, where\r\nthe wine cups were already laid out and green plums filled the dishes.\r\nAfter a goblet of wine had been swallowed they sat down to a\r\nconfidential talk and enjoyment of their wine.\r\n\r\nAs they drank the weather gradually changed, clouds gathering and\r\nthreatening rain. The servants pointed out a mass of cloud that looked\r\nlike a dragon hung in the sky. Both host and guest went to the window\r\nand leaned over the rail looking at it.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand the evolutions of dragons?” asked Tsʻao of the\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n“Not in detail.”\r\n\r\n“A dragon can assume any size, can rise in glory or hide from sight.\r\nBulky, it generates clouds and evolves mist; attenuated, it can\r\nscarcely hide a mustard stalk or conceal a shadow. Mounting, it can\r\nsoar to the empyrean; subsiding, it lurks in the uttermost depths of\r\nthe ocean. This is the mid-spring season and the dragon chooses this\r\nmoment for his transformations, like a man realising his desires and\r\noverrunning the world. The dragon among animals compares with the hero\r\namong men. You, O Yüan-tê, with your experience must know who are the\r\nheroes of the present day and I wish you would say who they are.”\r\n\r\n“How can a dullard like me know such things?”\r\n\r\n“Do not be so modest.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks to your kindly protection I have a post at Court. But as to\r\nheroes I really do not know who they are.”\r\n\r\n“You may not have looked upon their faces, but you have heard their\r\nnames.”\r\n\r\n“Yüan Shu, with his resources; is he one?”\r\n\r\nHis host laughed, “A rotting bone in a graveyard. I shall put him out\r\nof the way shortly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Yüan Shao then. The highest offices of State have been held in\r\nhis family for four generations and his clients are many. He is firmly\r\nposted in Ichou and he commands the services of many able men. Surely\r\nhe is one.”\r\n\r\n“A bully, but a coward; he is fond of grandiose schemes, but is devoid\r\nof decision; he makes for great things but grudges the necessary toil.\r\nHe loses sight of everything else in view of a little present\r\nadvantage. He is not one.”\r\n\r\n“There is Liu Ching-shêng. He is renowned as a man of perfection, whose\r\nfame has spread on all sides. Surely he is a hero.”\r\n\r\n“He is a mere semblance, a man of vain reputation. No; not he.”\r\n\r\n“Sun Tsʻê is a sturdy sort, the chief of all in the east. Is he a\r\nhero?”\r\n\r\n“He has profited by his father’s reputation; he is no hero.”\r\n\r\n“What of Liu Chang?”\r\n\r\n“Though he is of the reigning family, he is nothing more than a watch\r\ndog. How could you make a hero of him?”\r\n\r\n“What about Chang Hsiu, Chang Lu, Han Sui and all those?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao clapped his hands and laughed very loudly. “Paltry people like\r\nthem are not worth mentioning.”\r\n\r\n“With these exceptions I really know none.”\r\n\r\n“Now heroes are men who cherish lofty designs in their bosoms and have\r\nplans to achieve them; they have all-embracing schemes and the whole\r\nworld is at their mercy.”\r\n\r\n“Who is such a man?” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nTsʻao pointed his finger first at his guest and then at himself,\r\nsaying, “The only heroes in the world are you and I.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê gasped and the spoon and chopsticks rattled to the floor. Now\r\njust at that moment the storm burst with a tremendous peal of thunder\r\nand rush of rain. Yüan-tê stooped down to recover the fallen articles,\r\nsaying, “What a shock! and it was quite close.”\r\n\r\n“What! are you afraid of thunder?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “The wise man paled at a sudden peal of thunder or\r\nfierce gust of wind. Why should one not fear?”\r\n\r\nThus he glossed over the real fact, that it was the words he had heard\r\nthat had so startled him.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Constrained to lodge in a tiger’s lair,\r\n            He played a waiting part,\r\n        But when Tsʻao talked of breaking men,\r\n            Then terror gripped his heart.\r\n        But he cleverly used the thunder peal\r\n            As excuse for turning pale;\r\n        O quick to seize occasions thus!\r\n            He surely must prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shower had passed and there appeared two men rushing through the\r\ngarden, both armed. In spite of the attendants they forced their way to\r\nthe pavilion where sat the two friends. They were Kuan Yü and Chang\r\nFei.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers had been outside the city at archery practice when\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s invitation had come so peremptorily. On their return they\r\nheard that two officers had arrived and led away Yüan-tê to the\r\nMinister. They hastened to his palace and were told their brother was\r\nwith his host in the grounds and they feared something had happened. So\r\nthey rushed in. Now when they saw their brother quietly talking with\r\nTsʻao and enjoying a cup of wine, they took up their usual places and\r\nmeekly stood waiting.\r\n\r\n“Why did you come?” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“We heard that you, Sir, had invited our brother to a wine party and we\r\ncame to amuse you with a little sword play,” said they.\r\n\r\n“This is not a Hungmên banquet,” replied Tsʻao. “What use have we for\r\ntwo Hsiangs?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê smiled. The host ordered wine to be served to the two “Fan\r\nKʻuai” to allay their excitement and, soon after, the three took their\r\nleave and returned homeward.\r\n\r\n“We were nearly frightened to death,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nThe story of the dropped chopsticks was told. The two asked what their\r\nbrother intended by his actions and he told them that his learning\r\ngardening was to convince Tsʻao Tsʻao of his perfect simplicity and the\r\nabsence of any ambition. “But,” said he, “when he suddenly pointed to\r\nme as one of the heroes I was startled, for I thought he had some\r\nsuspicions. Happily the thunder at that moment supplied the excuse I\r\nwanted.”\r\n\r\n“Really you are very clever,” said they.\r\n\r\nNext day Tsʻao again invited Yüan-tê and while the two were drinking,\r\nMan Chʻung, who had been despatched to find out what Yüan Shao was\r\ndoing, came to present his report.\r\n\r\nHe said, “Kungsun Tsan has been completely defeated by Yüan.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the details? I should like to know how,” interrupted Liu\r\nPei.\r\n\r\n“They were at war and Tsan got the worst of it, so he acted on the\r\ndefensive, building a high wall about his army and on that erecting a\r\nhigh tower, which he called the I-ching Tower. Therein he placed all\r\nhis grain and took up his own quarters. His fighting men passed in and\r\nout without ceasing, some going out to give battle, others returning to\r\nrest. One of them was surrounded and sent to ask Kungsun to rescue him.\r\nKungsun said, “If I rescue him, hereafter every one will want to be\r\nhelped and will not exert himself.” So he did not go. This disgusted\r\nhis men and many deserted to the enemy so that his army diminished. He\r\nsent letters to the capital to crave help, but the messenger was\r\ncaptured. He sent to Chang Yen to arrange with him for a joint attack\r\nand those letters with the plans also fell into Shao’s hands and the\r\nplans were adopted by his enemy, who gave the signals agreed upon. Thus\r\nTsan fell into an ambush, lost heavily and retreated into the city.\r\nThere he was besieged and a subterranean passage was pierced into the\r\ntower where he lodged. The tower was set on fire and Kungsun could not\r\nescape. So he slew his wife and little ones and committed suicide. The\r\nflames destroyed the bodies of the whole family.\r\n\r\n“Yüan Shao has added the remnants of the vanquished army to his own and\r\nso become yet stronger. His brother Yüan Shu in Honan, however, has\r\nbecome so arrogant and cruel that the people have turned against him.\r\nThen he had sent to say he would yield the title of Emperor, which he\r\nhad assumed, in favour of his brother. His brother Shao demanded the\r\nseal also and Yüan Shu promised to bring it in person. Now he has\r\nabandoned Huainan and is about to occupy Hopei. If he succeeded, the\r\ntwo brothers will control adjoining districts and be dangerous.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sad story and Yüan-tê remembered with sorrow that, in the days\r\nof success and prosperity, the dead chieftain had pushed his interest\r\nand shown him much kindness. Moreover he was anxious to know the fate\r\nof Chao Tzŭ-lung.\r\n\r\nIn his heart he thought, “What better chance am I likely to get of\r\nsetting myself free?”\r\n\r\nSo he rose and said to Tsʻao Tsʻao, “If Yüan Shu goes over to join his\r\nbrother he will surely pass through Hsüchou. I beg you to give me an\r\narmy with which to smite him on the way. That will finish Yüan Shu.”\r\n\r\n“Memorialise the Emperor to-morrow and I will give you an army,” said\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nSo next day Yüan-tê went to an audience and Tsʻao gave him command of\r\nfive legions, horse and foot, and sent Chu Ling and Lu Chao with him.\r\n\r\nAt parting with Liu Pei the Emperor shed tears. As soon as he reached\r\nhis lodging he set about preparations for immediate departure,\r\nreturning his seal as General and preparing his weapons. Tung Chʻêng\r\nwent out some distance on the road to bid him farewell.\r\n\r\n“You must not mind my going; this journey will assuredly help on the\r\nscheme,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Keep your mind fixed on that,” said Tung, “and never forget what His\r\nMajesty requires of us.”\r\n\r\nThey parted. Presently his brothers asked him why he was in such a\r\nhurry to get away.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “I have been a bird in a cage, a fish in a net. This is\r\nlike the fish regaining the open sea and the bird soaring into the blue\r\nsky. I suffered much from the confinement.”\r\n\r\nNow Kuo Chia and Chʻêng Yü had been absent inspecting stores and\r\nsupplies when Liu Pei left. As soon as they heard of his expedition\r\nthey went in to see their master, asking him why he had let Liu Pei go\r\nin command of an army.\r\n\r\n“He is going to cut off Yüan Shu.”\r\n\r\n“Formerly, when he was governor of Yüchou, we recommended that he\r\nshould be put to death but you would not hear of it. Now you have given\r\nhim an army. You have allowed the dragon to reach the sea, the tiger to\r\nreturn to the mountains. What control will you have in future?”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Chʻêng Yü and Kuo Chia followed in the same strain.\r\n\r\n“Even if you would not put him to death you need not have let him go.\r\nAs the proverb says, ‘Relax opposition for one day and age-long harm\r\nensues.’ You must admit the truth of this.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao recognised that these were prudent counsels so he sent Hsü Chʻu\r\nwith a half company and imperative orders to bring Yüan-tê back again.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei was marching as rapidly as possible when he noticed a cloud of\r\ndust in the rear and remarked to his brothers, “Surely they are\r\npursuing us.”\r\n\r\nHe halted and made a stockade and ordered his brothers to be in\r\nreadiness, one on each flank. Presently the messenger arrived and found\r\nhimself in the midst of an army ready for battle. He dismounted and\r\nentered the camp to speak with Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“Sir, on what business have you come?” asked Pei.\r\n\r\n“The Minister has sent me to request you to return as he has further\r\nmatters to discuss with you.”\r\n\r\n“When a general has once taken the field even the royal command is of\r\nno effect. I bade farewell to the Emperor, I received the Minister’s\r\ncommands and there can be nothing further to talk about. You may return\r\nforthwith and take that as my reply.”\r\n\r\nThe messenger was undecided what action to take. He knew of the\r\nfriendship that existed between the Minister and his late guest and he\r\nhad no orders to kill. He could only return with this reply and ask\r\nfurther instructions. So he left. When he related what had occurred\r\nTsʻao still hesitated to take any action. His advisers urged upon him\r\nthat this refusal to return meant enmity.\r\n\r\n“Still, two of my men are with him,” said Tsʻao. “He will not dare do\r\nanything unfriendly, I think. Beside, I sent him and I cannot go back\r\non my own orders.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê was not pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n        He took his arms, he fed his steed,\r\n            And fared forth willingly,\r\n        Intent to accomplish his King’s behest\r\n            Deep graved on his memory.\r\n        At least he had broken out of his cage,\r\n            He heard not the tiger’s roar,\r\n        He had shaken the shackles from his feet,\r\n            As a dragon on high could soar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Ma Tʻêng heard that Liu Pei had set forth he reported that\r\npressing business called him and marched back to his own district.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê reached Hsüchou the governor, Chʻê Chou, came to meet him,\r\nand when the official banquet was over, Sun Chʻien and Mi Chu came to\r\nvisit him. Then he proceeded to his residence to greet his family.\r\n\r\nScouts were sent out to see what Yüan Shu was doing. They came back\r\nwith the intelligence that his arrogance had driven away his banditti\r\nallies, who had returned to their mountain fastnesses. His forces thus\r\nreduced he had written resigning the Imperial style he had assumed in\r\nfavour of his brother Shao, who had at once commanded his presence.\r\nThereupon he packed up the palace fittings he had had made, got the\r\nremnants of his army in order and marched west.\r\n\r\nWhen he neared Hsüchou, Yüan-tê led out his captains with the five\r\nlegions to meet him. Yüan sent out Chi Ling to force a way through. But\r\nChang Fei opposed him and attacked without a parley. In the tenth bout\r\nhe cut down Chi Ling. The defeated soldiers fled in all directions.\r\n\r\nThen Yüan Shu came up with his own army. Yüan-tê placed his captains\r\nright and left, he himself being in the centre, and so met Yüan Shu. As\r\nsoon as the enemy came near Yüan-tê began to abuse him. “O rebellious\r\none, and wicked, I have a command to destroy you. Yield, then, with\r\ngood grace and so escape your punishment.”\r\n\r\n“Base weaver of mats and mean maker of straw sandals, how dare you make\r\nlight of me?” replied Shu and he gave the signal for an attack.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê retired and his captains from the flanks closed in. They smote\r\nthe army of Shu till corpses littered the plain and blood flowed in\r\nstreams. At the same time the bandits attacked the baggage train and\r\ncompleted the destruction. Shu tried to retreat to Shouchʻun but the\r\nbandits barred the road.\r\n\r\nHe sought refuge in Chiangtʻing, with the small company left of all his\r\narmy. And these were the weakly ones able neither to fight nor flee. It\r\nwas then the height of summer and their food was nearly exhausted. The\r\nwhole provision consisted of thirty measures of wheat. This was made\r\nover to the soldiers and the members of his household went hungry. Many\r\ndied of actual starvation. Yüan Shu could not swallow the coarse food\r\nthat the soldiers lived on. One day he bade his cook bring him some\r\nhoney-water to quench his thirst.\r\n\r\n“There is no water, save that tainted with blood,” replied the cook.\r\n“Where can I get honey-water?”\r\n\r\nThis was the last straw. Shu sat up on his couch and rolled out on the\r\nfloor with a loud cry. Blood gushed from his mouth and thus he died. It\r\nwas the sixth month of the fourth year of “Established Tranquillity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    The last days of Han approached and weapons clashed in every\r\n                                                             quarter,\r\n    The misguided Yüan Shu, lost to all sense of honour,\r\n    Forgetful of his forefathers, who had filled the State’s highest\r\n                                                               Offices,\r\n    Madly aspired to become himself Emperor,\r\n    Resting his outrageous claim on the possession of The Seal,\r\n    And arrogantly boasting that thus he fulfilled the design of\r\n                                                                Heaven.\r\n    Alas! Sick unto death he vainly begged for a little honey-water;\r\n    He died, alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan Shu being dead, his nephew taking his coffin and his wife and\r\nchildren, sought shelter in Luchiang. There the magistrate, Hsü Chʻiu,\r\nslew all the survivors. Among the possessions he found the Imperial\r\nSeal, which he at once took to the capital and presented to Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, for which service he was made Prefect of Kaoling.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê heard that Yüan Shu was dead he prepared a report to the\r\nthrone, and sent it to Tsʻao Tsʻao. He sent the two officers deputed by\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao back to the capital, keeping the army to defend Hsüchou. He\r\nalso personally went through the country-side commanding the people to\r\nresume their ordinary avocations.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was angry when his two officers returned without their man\r\nand was going to put them to death. Hsün Yü reasoned with him.\r\n\r\n“The power was in Liu Pei’s hands and so these two had no alternative,”\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nSo they were pardoned.\r\n\r\n“You should instruct Chʻê Chou to try to destroy him,” said Yü.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he sent secret orders to Chʻê Chou, who took Chʻên Têng\r\ninto his confidence and asked his advice. Têng advised an ambush in the\r\ncity gate to attack Liu Pei on his return from the country; he himself\r\nwould attack the escort with arrows from the city walls. Chʻê agreed to\r\ntry this.\r\n\r\nThen Têng went to his father to tell him. His father Chʻên Kuei bade\r\nhim go and warn the intended victim. He at once rode away to do so.\r\nBefore long he met the two younger brothers, to whom he told his story.\r\n\r\nNow Yüan-tê was following some distance behind. As soon as Chang Fei\r\nheard of the plot he wanted to attack the ambush, but Yün-chʻang said\r\nhe had a better plan.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “The ambush will be a failure. And I think we can compass the\r\ndeath of Chʻê Chou. In the night we will pretend to be some of Tsʻao’s\r\nmen and entice him out to meet us. We will slay him.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei approved of the plan. Now the soldiers still had some of\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s army banners and wore similar armour. About the third\r\nwatch they came to the city wall and hailed the gate. Those on guard\r\nasked who they were. The men replied that they were Chang Wên-yüan’s\r\ntroop sent from the capital. This was told Chʻê Chou who sent hastily\r\nfor Chʻên Têng to ask his advice.\r\n\r\n“If I do not receive them they will suspect my loyalty,” said he. “Yet\r\nif I go out I may be victim of a ruse.”\r\n\r\nSo he went up on the wall and said it was too dark to distinguish\r\nfriends from foes and they must wait till daylight. The men shouted\r\nback that Liu Pei must be kept in ignorance and they begged him to let\r\nthem in. Still Chʻê Chou hesitated. They shouted louder than ever to\r\nopen the gate.\r\n\r\nPresently Chʻê girded on his armour, placed himself at the head of a\r\ncompany and went out. He galloped over the bridge, shouting, “Where is\r\nWên-yüan?”\r\n\r\nThen lights blazed around and he recognised Kuan Yü with his sword\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\n“Wretch!” cried Kuan Yü. “You would plot to slay my brother, would\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nChʻê Chou was too frightened to make good defence and he turned to\r\nre-enter the gate. But as he reached the drawbridge flights of arrows\r\nmet him, wherefore he turned aside and galloped along under the wall.\r\nBut Kuan Yü came quickly in pursuit. His sword was raised aloft and as\r\nit came down the fugitive fell to the earth. Kuan Yü cut off his head\r\nand returned, shouting, “I have slain the traitor. You others need not\r\nfear if you only surrender.”\r\n\r\nThey threw aside their spears and gave in. As soon as the excitement\r\nhad calmed Kuan Yü took the head to show Yüan-tê and told him the story\r\nof the plot.\r\n\r\n“But what will Tsʻao Tsʻao think of this?” said Yüan-tê. “And he may\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n“If he does we can meet him,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nBut Yüan-tê was grieved beyond measure. When he entered the city the\r\nelders of the people knelt in the road to welcome him. When he reached\r\nhis residence he found that Chang Fei had already exterminated the\r\nfamily of Chʻê Chou.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “We have slain one of his best friends and how will he\r\nstand that?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind!” cried Chʻên Têng. “I have a plan.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Just from grave danger extricated,\r\n        An injured friend must be placated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by Chʻên Têng will be disclosed next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nYÜAN AND TSʻAO BOTH TAKE THE FIELD:\r\nTHE TWO BROTHERS CAPTURE TWO CAPTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the plan proposed to Yüan-tê: “Yüan Shao is Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nterror. He is strongly posted in an extensive district with a hundred\r\nlegions of fighting men and many able officers. Write letters and pray\r\nhim to rescue you.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “But we have never had any dealings with each other\r\nand he is unlikely to do such a thing for one who has just destroyed\r\nhis brother.”\r\n\r\n“There is some one here whose family have been on intimate terms with\r\nthe Yüans for a hundred years. Shao would surely come if he wrote.”\r\n\r\n“And who is this?”\r\n\r\n“A man you know well and respect greatly; can you not guess?”\r\n\r\n“You surely mean Chêng Kʻang-chʻêng,” said Liu Pei suddenly.\r\n\r\n“That is he,” said Chʻên Têng smiling.\r\n\r\nNow Chêng Kʻang-chʻêng’s ming was Yüan. He was a student and a man of\r\ngreat talent, who had long studied under Ma Jung. Ma Jung was peculiar\r\nas a teacher. Whenever he lectured he let fall a curtain behind which\r\nwere a circle of singing girls. The students were assembled in front of\r\nthis curtain. Chêng Yüan attended these lectures for three years and\r\nnever once let his eyes wander to the curtain.\r\n\r\nNaturally the master admired his pupil. After Chêng Yüan had finished\r\nhis studies and gone home Ma Jung praised him to the others, saying,\r\n“Only one man has penetrated the inner meaning of my instructions and\r\nthat one is Chêng Yüan.”\r\n\r\nIn the Chêng household the waiting maids were familiar with Mao’s\r\nedition of the Odes. Once one of the maids opposed Yüan’s wishes, so as\r\npunishment she was made to kneel in front of the steps. Another girl\r\nmade fun of her, quoting from an ode;—\r\n\r\n\r\n        “What are you doing there in the mire?”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kneeling girl capped the verse from another ode; quoth she:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        “’Twas but a simple word I said,\r\n        Yet brought it wrath upon my head.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the family in which he had been born. In the reign of the\r\nEmperor Huan he rose to the rank of President of a Board, but when the\r\nTen Eunuchs began to control the government he gave up office and\r\nretired into the country to Hsüchou. Liu Pei had known him before, had\r\nconsulted him on many occasions and greatly respected him.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei was glad that he had remembered this man and without loss of\r\ntime, in company with Chʻên Têng, he went to his house to ask him to\r\ndraft this letter, which he generously consented to do.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien was entrusted with the task of delivery and set out at once.\r\nShao read it and considered the matter long before speaking. “Liu Pei\r\ndestroyed my brother and I ought not to help him, but out of\r\nconsideration for the writer of this letter I must.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he assembled his officers to consider an attack upon Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nTʻien Fêng said, “Do not raise an army. The people are worn out and the\r\ngranaries are empty with these constant wars. Let us rather report the\r\nrecent victory of Kungsun Tsan to the Throne. If that does not reach\r\nthe Emperor, then memorialise that Tsʻao Tsʻao is hindering the\r\ngovernment. Then raise an army: occupy Liyang, assemble a fleet in\r\nHonan, prepare weapons, send out your various divisions and within\r\nthree years you will win all round.”\r\n\r\nThe adviser Shên Pʻei replied, “I do not agree. The military genius of\r\nour illustrious lord having overcome the hordes of the north, to\r\ndispose of Tsʻao is as simple as turning one’s hand; it is not a matter\r\nof months.”\r\n\r\nChü Shou said, “Victory is not always to the many. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\ndiscipline is excellent; his soldiers are brave and well drilled. He\r\nwill not sit down quietly waiting to be surrounded as Kungsun Tsan did.\r\nNow you abandon the intention to inform the Throne of our success,\r\nwhich I find a good plan, but you intend to send out an army without\r\nany valid excuse. Our lord should not do that.”\r\n\r\nThen followed adviser Kuo Tʻu, “You are wrong. No expedition against\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao can lack excuse. But if our master would take the chance\r\nnow offering itself of coming into his own, he will accede to the\r\nrequest in the letter and ally himself with Liu Pei for the destruction\r\nof Tsʻao. This would win the approval of heaven and the affections of\r\nthe people, a double blessing.”\r\n\r\nThus the four advisers differed and wrangled and Yüan Shao could not\r\ndecide which to follow. Then there came two others, Hsü Yu and Hsün\r\nShên, and, seeing them, Shao said, “You two have wide experience, how\r\nwould you decide?”\r\n\r\nThe two made their obeisance and Yüan Shao said, “A letter from Chêng\r\nthe President has arrived, counselling me to support Liu Pei in an\r\nattack on Tsʻao Tsʻao. Now am I to send an army or not send an army?”\r\n\r\nThey both cried with one voice, “Send! Your armies are numerous enough\r\nand strong enough; you will destroy a traitor and help the dynasty.”\r\n\r\n“Your words just express my desire,” said Shao and thenceforward the\r\ndiscussion turned on the expedition.\r\n\r\nFirst Sun Chʻien was sent back with Yüan Shao’s consent and\r\ninstructions for Liu Pei to make ready to co-operate. Officers were\r\nassigned divisions and advisers were told off. The army was to be\r\ncomposed of thirty legions, horse and foot in equal numbers. They were\r\nto march on Liyang.\r\n\r\nWhen the arrangements were complete Kuo Tʻu went to his chief saying,\r\n“In order to manifest the righteousness of your attack on Tsʻao it\r\nwould be well to issue a manifesto with a summary of his various\r\ncrimes.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao approved of this and a certain Chʻên Lin, well known as a\r\nscholar, who had been a Recorder in the late Emperor’s reign, was\r\nentrusted to compose such a document. This is the manifesto:—\r\n\r\n“A perspicacious ruler wisely provides against political vicissitudes;\r\na loyal minister carefully foresees the difficulties in the assertion\r\nof authority. Wherefore a man of unusual parts precedes an\r\nextraordinary situation, and of such a man the achievements will be\r\nextraordinary. For indeed the ordinary man is quite unequal to an\r\nextraordinary situation.\r\n\r\n“In former days, after having gained ascendancy over a weakling King of\r\nthe powerful Tsʻin Dynasty, Chao Kao wielded the whole authority of the\r\nThrone, overruling the government. All dignity and fortune came through\r\nhim and his contemporaries were restrained so that none dared to speak\r\nopenly. Slowly but surely evolved the tragedy of the Wangi Temple, when\r\nthe Emperor was slain and the Imperial tablets perished in the flames.\r\nHe, the author of these crimes, has ever since been held up to obloquy\r\nas the arch example of an evil-doer.\r\n\r\n“In the later days of the Empress Lü of the Hans the world saw Lü Chan\r\nand Lü Lu, brothers of the Empress and fellows in wickedness,\r\nmonopolising the powers of government. Within the capital they\r\ncommanded two armies and without they ruled the feudal states of Liang\r\nand Chao. They arbitrarily controlled all State affairs and decided all\r\nquestions in the council chamber and the Court. This dominance of the\r\nbase and declension of the noble continued till the hearts of the\r\npeople grew cold within them.\r\n\r\n“Thereupon Chou Pʻo, Marquis of Chiang, and Liu Chang, Marquis of\r\nChuhsü, asserted their dignity and let loose their wrath. They\r\ndestroyed the contumacious ministers and restored their Ruler to his\r\nroyal state. Thus they enabled the kingly way to be re-established and\r\nthe glory to be manifested. Here are two instances where ministers\r\nasserted their authority.\r\n\r\n“This Tsʻao, now a minister, forsooth, had for ancestor a certain\r\neunuch named Tʻêng, fitting companion of Tso Kuan and Hsü Huang. All\r\nthree were prodigies of wickedness and insatiably avaricious and, let\r\nloose on the world, they hindered ethical progress and preyed upon the\r\npopulace. This Tʻêng begged for and adopted Tsʻao’s father who, by\r\nwholesale bribery, wagons of gold and cartloads of jewels presented at\r\nthe gates of the influential, contrived to sneak his way into\r\nconsiderable office where he could subvert authority. Thus Tsʻao is the\r\ndepraved bantling of a monstrous excrescence, devoid of all virtue in\r\nhimself, ferocious and cunning, delighting in disorder and revelling in\r\npublic calamity.\r\n\r\n“Now I, Mu-fu, a man of war, have mustered my armies and displayed my\r\nmight that I may sweep away and destroy the evil opponents of\r\ngovernment. I have already had to deal with Tung Cho, the ruffian who\r\ninvaded the official circle and wrested the government. At that time I\r\ngrasped my sword and beat the drums to restore order in the east. I\r\nassembled warriors, selected the best and took them into my service. In\r\nthis matter I came into relations with this Tsʻao and conferred with\r\nhim to further my scheme. I gave him command of a subordinate force and\r\nlooked to him to render such petty service as he was equal to. I\r\nsuffered his stupidities and condoned his shortcomings, his rash\r\nattacks and facile retreats, his losses and shameful defeats, his\r\nrepeated destruction of whole armies. Again and again I sent him more\r\ntroops and filled the gaps in his depleted ranks. I even addressed a\r\nmemorial to the Throne for him to be appointed Governor of Yenchou. I\r\nmade him feared as he were a tiger. I added to his honours and\r\nincreased his authority, hoping that eventually he would justify\r\nhimself by a victory such as fell to Mêng Ming of Tsʻin.\r\n\r\n“But Tsʻao availed himself of the opportunity to overstep all bounds,\r\nto give free rein to violence and evil. He stripped the common people,\r\noutraged the good and injured the virtuous. Pien Jang, Prefect of\r\nKiukiang, was a man of conspicuous talent and of world-wide reputation.\r\nHe was honest in speech and correct in demeanour. He spoke without\r\nflattery. He was put to death and his head exposed, and his family\r\nutterly destroyed. From that day to this scholars have deeply mourned\r\nand popular resentment has steadily grown. One man raised his arm in\r\nanger and the whole countryside followed him. Whereupon Tsʻao was\r\nsmitten at Hsüchou and his district was snatched by Lü Pu. He fled\r\neastward without shelter or refuge.\r\n\r\n“My policy is a strong trunk and weak branches, a commanding central\r\ngovernment and obedient feudal lords. Also I am no partizan. Therefore\r\nI again raised my banners, donned my armour and moved forward to\r\nattack. My drums rolled for an assault on Lü Pu and his multitudes\r\nincontinently fled. I saved Tsʻao from destruction and restored him to\r\na position of authority. Wherein I must confess to showing no kindness\r\nto the people of Yenchou although it was a great matter for Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Later it happened that the imperial cortège moved west and a horde of\r\nrebels rose and attacked. The course of government was hindered. At\r\nthat moment my territory was threatened from the north and I could not\r\nleave it. Wherefore I sent one of my officers to Tsʻao to see to the\r\nrepair of the temples and the protection of the youthful sovereign.\r\nThereupon Tsʻao gave the rein to his inclinations. He arbitrarily\r\nordered the removal of the Court. He brought shame upon the ruling\r\nHouse and subverted the laws. He engrossed the presidency of the three\r\nhighest offices and monopolised the control of the administration.\r\nOffices and rewards were conferred according to his will; punishment\r\nwas at his word. He glorified whole families of those he loved; he\r\nexterminated whole clans of those he hated. Open critics were executed;\r\nsecret opponents were assassinated. Officials locked their lips;\r\nwayfarers only exchanged glances. Presidents of Boards recorded levies\r\nand every government official held a sinecure.\r\n\r\n“The late Yang Piao, a man who had filled two of the highest offices of\r\nState as President of two Boards, because of some petty grudge was,\r\nthough guiltless, charged with a crime. He was beaten and suffered\r\nevery form of cruelty. This arbitrary and impulsive act was a flagrant\r\ndisregard of constitutional rules.\r\n\r\n“Another victim was the Councillor Chao Yan. He was faithful in\r\nremonstrance, honest in speech, endowed with the highest principles of\r\nrectitude. He was listened to at Court. His words carried enough weight\r\nwith the Emperor to cause him to modify his intention and confer reward\r\nfor outspokenness. Desirous of diverting all power into his own hands\r\nand stifle all criticism, Tsʻao presumed to arrest and put to death\r\nthis censor, in defiance of all legal procedure.\r\n\r\n“Another evil deed was the destruction of the tomb of Prince Liang\r\nHsiao, the brother of the late Emperor. His tomb should certainly have\r\nbeen respected, even its mulberries and lindera trees, its cypresses\r\nand its pines. Tsʻao led soldiers to the cemetery and stood by while it\r\nwas desecrated, the coffin destroyed and the poor corpse exposed. They\r\nstole the gold and jewels of the dead. This deed brought tears to the\r\neyes of the Emperor and rent the hearts of all men. Tsʻao also\r\nappointed ‘Openers-of-Grave-Mounds’ and ‘Seekers-for-Gold’ whose tracks\r\nwere marked by desecrated graves and exhumed bodies. Indeed, while\r\nassuming the position of the highest officer of State, he indulged the\r\ninclination of a bandit, polluting the State, oppressing the people, a\r\nbane to gods and men.\r\n\r\n“He added to this by setting up minute and vexatious prohibitions so\r\nthat there were nets and snares spread in every pathway, traps and\r\npitfalls laid in every road. A hand raised was caught in a net, a foot\r\nadvanced was taken in an entanglement. Wherefore the men of Yen and Yü\r\nwaxed desperate and the inhabitants of the metropolis groaned and\r\nmurmured in anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Read down the names through all the years\r\n        Of ministers that all men curse\r\n        For greed and cruelty and lust;\r\n        Than Tsʻao you will not find a worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have investigated the cases of evil deeds in the provinces, but I\r\nhave been unable to reform him. I have given him repeated opportunities\r\nhoping that he would repent. But he has the heart of a wolf, the nature\r\nof a wild beast. He nourishes evil in his bosom and desires to pull\r\ndown the pillars of the State, to weaken the House of Han, to destroy\r\nthe loyal and true and to stand himself conspicuous as the chiefest of\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n“Formerly, when I attacked the north, Kungsun Tsan, that obstinate\r\nbandit and perverse bravo, resisted my might for a year. Before he\r\ncould be destroyed this Tsʻao wrote to him that, under the pretence of\r\nassisting the Imperial armies, he would covertly lead them to\r\ndestruction. The plot was discovered through his messengers and Tsan\r\nalso perished. This blunted Tsʻao’s ardour and his plans failed.\r\n\r\n“Now he is camped at the Ao Granaries with the river to strengthen his\r\nposition. Like the mantis in the story, who threatened the chariot with\r\nits forelegs, he thinks himself terrible. But with the dignity and\r\nprestige of Han to support me I confront the whole world. I have\r\nspearmen by millions, horsemen by thousands of squadrons, fierce and\r\nvigorous warriors strong as Chung Huang, Hsia Yu and Wu Huo, those\r\nheroes of antiquity. I have enlisted expert archers and strong bowmen.\r\nIn Pingchou my armies have crossed the Tʻaihang Range and in Chingchou\r\nthey have forded the Chi and Tʻa Rivers. They have coasted down the\r\nYellow River to attack his van, and from Chingchou they have descended\r\nto Wanyeh to smite his rearguard. Thunder-like in the weight of their\r\nmarch, tiger-like in the alertness of their advance, they converge on\r\nLotʻing. They are as flames let loose among light grass, as the blue\r\nocean poured on glowing embers. Is there any hope that he escape\r\ndestruction?\r\n\r\n“Of the hordes of Tsʻao, those who can fight are from the north or from\r\nother camps and they all desire to return home. They weep whenever they\r\nlook to the north. The others belong to Yen or Yü, being remnants of\r\nthe armies of Lü Pu and Chang Yang. Beaten, stern necessity forced them\r\nto accept service, but they take it only as a temporary expedient.\r\nEvery man who has been wounded is an enemy. If I give the signal to\r\nreturn and send my drums and shawms to the mountain tops, and wave the\r\nwhite flag to show them they may surrender, they will melt away like\r\ndew before the sun and no blood will be shed. The victory will be mine.\r\n\r\n“Now the Hans are failing and the bonds of Empire are relaxed. The\r\nsacred Dynasty has no supporter, the Ministers are not strong enough to\r\ncope with the difficulties. Within the capital the responsible\r\nMinisters are crestfallen and helpless. There is no one to rely upon.\r\nSuch loyal and high principled men as are left are browbeaten by a\r\ntyrannical Minister. How can they manifest their virtue?\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao has surrounded the Palace with seven hundred veterans, the\r\nostensible object being to guard the Emperor, but the covert design\r\nbeing to hold him prisoner. I fear this is but the first step in\r\nusurpation and so I take my part. Now is the time for loyal Ministers\r\nto sacrifice their lives, the opportunity for officers to perform\r\nmeritorious deeds. Can I fail to urge you?\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao has forged commands to himself to undertake the control of\r\ngovernment affairs and, in the name of the State, sends out calls for\r\nmilitary assistance. I fear lest distant districts may obey his behest\r\nand send troops to help him, to the detriment of the multitude and\r\ntheir everlasting shame. No wise man will do so.\r\n\r\n“The forces of four prefectures are moving out simultaneously. When\r\nthis call reaches Chingchou you will see their forces co-operate with\r\nthose of Chang Hsiu. All districts and departments ought to organise\r\nvolunteers and set them along their borders to demonstrate their force\r\nand prove their loyal support of the Dynasty. Will not this be\r\nrendering extraordinary service?\r\n\r\n“The rank of Marquis, with feudal rights over five thousand households\r\nand a money reward of fifty millions, will be the reward of him who\r\nbrings the head of Tsʻao. No questions will be asked of those who\r\nsurrender. I publish abroad this notice of my bounty and the rewards\r\noffered that you may realise that the Dynasty is in real danger.”\r\n\r\nShao read this effusion with great joy. He at once ordered copies to be\r\nposted everywhere, in towns and cities, at gates (tax stations) and\r\nferries and passes. Copies found their way to the capital and one got\r\ninto Tsʻao Tsʻao’s palace. That day he happened to be in bed with a bad\r\nheadache. The servants took the paper to the sick man’s room. He read\r\nit and was frightened from the tips of his hair to the marrow of his\r\nvery bones. He broke out into a cold perspiration and his headache\r\nvanished. He bounded out of bed and said to Tsʻao Hung, “Who wrote\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\n“They say it is Chʻên Lin’s pencil,” replied he.\r\n\r\nTsʻao laughed “They have the literary gift; they had better have the\r\nmilitary too to back it up. This fellow may be a very elegant writer,\r\nbut what if Yüan Shao’s fighting capacity falls short?”\r\n\r\nHe called his advisers together to consider the next move. Kʻung Jung\r\nheard of the summons and went to his master saying, “You should not\r\nfight with Yüan Shao; he is too strong. Make peace.”\r\n\r\nHsün Yü said, “He is despicable: do not make peace.”\r\n\r\nJung replied, “His land is wide and his people strong. He has many\r\nskilful strategists and he has loyal and able captains. You cannot say\r\nhe is despicable.”\r\n\r\nYü laughed saying, “His army is a rabble. One captain, Tʻien Fêng, is\r\nbold but treacherous; another, Hsü Yu, is greedy and ignorant; Shên\r\nPʻei is devoted but stupid; Fêng Chi is steady but useless. And these\r\nfour of such different temperaments, mutually incompatible, will make\r\nfor confusion rather than efficiency. Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou are\r\nworthless and can be disposed of in the first battle and the others are\r\npoor, rough stuff. What is the use even of their legions?”\r\n\r\nKʻung Jung was silent and Tsʻao smiled. “They are even as Hsün Wen-jo\r\ndescribes,” said he.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao issued orders. Generals Liu Tai and Wang Chung were to lead\r\nan army of five legions, displaying the minister’s banners, and march\r\nagainst Hsüchou to attack Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nThis Liu Tai had been governor of Yenchou but had surrendered and\r\nentered Tsʻao Tsʻao’s service after the fall of the city. Tsʻao had\r\ngiven him a rank as supernumerary leader and now was disposed to make\r\nuse of him.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao himself took command of a large army of twenty legions for\r\na simultaneous attack on Yüan Shao at Liyang.\r\n\r\nA certain adviser said he thought the two captains sent against Liu Pei\r\nwere unequal to their task.\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Tsʻao. “They are not meant to fight Liu Pei; it is\r\nmerely a feint. They have orders not to make any real attack till I\r\nhave overcome Yüan Shao. Then Liu Pei will be next.”\r\n\r\nLiu Tai and Wang Chung went their way and Tsʻao Tsʻao marched out his\r\ngrand army, which came into touch with the enemy, then eighty li\r\ndistant, at Liyang. Both sides made fortified camps and waited watching\r\neach other. This went on for two months.\r\n\r\nThere was dissension in Yüan Shao’s camp. Hsü Yu was at enmity with his\r\ncolleague, Shên Pʻei, and the strategist Chu Shou resented the\r\nrejection of his plan. So they would not attack. Yüan Shao also could\r\nnot make up his mind. Tired of this state of inaction Tsʻao Tsʻao then\r\ngave certain commanders definite points to hold and marched back to\r\nHsütu.\r\n\r\nThe five legions sent against Liu Pei went into camp a hundred li from\r\nHsüchou. The camp made an imposing display of the banners of the Prime\r\nMinister but no attacks followed. Their spies were very busy north of\r\nthe river. On the defensive side, Liu Pei, as he was uncertain of the\r\nstrength of the force against him, dared not move.\r\n\r\nSuddenly orders came for the Tsʻao army to attack and then discord\r\nshowed itself.\r\n\r\nLiu Tai said, “The Minister orders an attack; you advance.”\r\n\r\nWang Chung replied, “You were named first.”\r\n\r\n“I am the Commander in Chief; it is not my place to go first.”\r\n\r\n“I will go with you in joint command,” said Chung.\r\n\r\n“Let us cast lots and he upon whom the lot falls must go,” said Tai.\r\n\r\nThey drew lots and it fell to Wang Chung, who advanced toward Hsüchou\r\nwith half the force.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê heard of the threatened attack he called Chʻên Têng to\r\nconsult.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “There is dissension in Yüan Shao’s camp at Liyang so\r\nthey do not advance. We do not know where Tsʻao Tsʻao is but his own\r\nbanner is not displayed in his Liyang camp. Why then is it shown here?”\r\n\r\nChʻên Têng replied, “His tricks take a hundred forms. It must be that\r\nhe regards the north as most important and has gone there to look after\r\nits defence. He dares not show his flag there and I feel sure it is\r\nonly meant to mislead us. He is not here.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê then asked whether one of his brothers would find out the truth\r\nand Chang Fei volunteered to go.\r\n\r\n“I fear you are unsuited for this,” said Yüan-tê. “You are too\r\nimpetuous.”\r\n\r\n“If Tsʻao is there I will haul him over here,” said Fei.\r\n\r\n“Let me go first and find out,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“If you go I shall feel more at ease,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSo Kuan Yü set out with three companies to reconnoitre. It was then\r\nearly winter and snow was falling from a gloomy sky. They marched\r\nregardless of the snow and came near Wang Chung’s camp with arms all\r\nready to attack. Kuan Yü summoned Wang Chung to a parley.\r\n\r\n“The Minister is here: why do you not surrender?” said Wang Chung.\r\n\r\n“Beg him to come to the front for I would speak with him,” replied Kuan\r\nYü.\r\n\r\n“Is he likely to come out to see such as you?”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü angrily dashed forward and Wang Chung set his spear to meet\r\nhim. Yü rode till he came close to his antagonist, then suddenly\r\nwheeled away. Wang Chung went after him and followed up a slope. Just\r\nas they passed the crest, Yü suddenly wheeled again, shouted and came\r\non flourishing the mighty sword. Wang Chung could not withstand that\r\nand fled. But Kuan Yü, changing the huge sword to his left hand, with\r\nhis right laid hold of his victim by the straps of his breastplate,\r\nlifted him out of the saddle and rode away to his own lines with the\r\ncaptive laid across the pommel of his saddle. Wang Chung’s men\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\nThe captive was sent to Hsüchou, where he was summoned into the\r\npresence of Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? What office do you hold? How dare you falsely display the\r\nensigns of the Minister Tsʻao Tsʻao?” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by falsely when I simply obeyed my orders?” said\r\nWang. “My master wanted to produce the impression that he was present.\r\nReally he was not there.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei treated him kindly, giving him food and clothing; but put him\r\nin prison till his colleague could be captured. Kuan Yü said that,\r\nknowing his brother had peaceful intentions in his mind, he captured\r\nthe man instead of slaying him.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid of Chang Fei’s hasty and impulsive temper,” said Liu Pei.\r\n“He would have slain this man. So I could not send him. There is no\r\nadvantage in killing persons of this sort and while alive they are\r\noften useful in amicable settlements.”\r\n\r\nHere Chang Fei said, “You have got this Wang; now I will go and get the\r\nother man.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful,” said his brother. “Liu Tai was once governor of Yenchou\r\nand he was one of the nobles who met at Tigertrap Pass to destroy Tung\r\nCho. He is not to be despised.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think him worth talking about so much. I will bring him in\r\nalive just as my brother did this other.”\r\n\r\n“I fear that if his life be lost it may upset our designs,” said Liu\r\nPei.\r\n\r\n“If I kill him I will forfeit my own life,” said Fei.\r\n\r\nSo he was given three companies and went off quickly.\r\n\r\nThe capture of his colleague made Liu Tai careful. He strengthened his\r\ndefences and kept behind them. He took no notice of the daily\r\nchallenges and continual insults which began with Chang Fei’s arrival.\r\n\r\nAfter some days Fei evolved a ruse. He issued orders to prepare to rush\r\nthe enemy’s camp at night, but he himself spent the day drinking.\r\nPretending to be very intoxicated he held a court martial and one\r\nsoldier was severely flogged for a breach of discipline. The man was\r\nleft bound in the midst of the camp, Fei saying, “Wait till I am ready\r\nto start to-night; you shall be sacrificed to the flag.” At the same\r\ntime he gave secret orders to the custodians to let the man escape.\r\n\r\nThe man found his opportunity, crept out of camp and went over to the\r\nenemy, to whom he betrayed the plan of a night attack. As the man bore\r\nsigns of savage punishment Liu Tai was the more disposed to credit his\r\ndesertion and tale and made his arrangements, putting the greater part\r\nof his men in ambush outside his camp so that it was empty.\r\n\r\nThat night, having divided his men into three parties, Chang Fei went\r\nto attack the camp. A few men were ordered to advance directly, dash in\r\nand set fire going. Two larger bodies of men were to go round to the\r\nrear of the camp and attack when they saw the fire well started. At the\r\nthird watch (midnight) Chang Fei, with his veterans, went to cut off\r\nLiu Tai’s road to the rear.\r\n\r\nThe thirty men told off to start a conflagration made their way into\r\nthe camp and were successful. When the flames arose the ambushed men\r\nrushed out but only to find themselves attacked on both sides. This\r\nconfused them and as they knew nothing of the number of their\r\nassailants they were panic-stricken and scattered.\r\n\r\nLiu Tai, with a company of footmen got clear of the fight and fled, but\r\nhe went straight toward Chang Fei. Escape was impossible and the two\r\nmen rode up each to attack the other. Chang Fei captured his opponent\r\nand the men surrendered.\r\n\r\nChang Fei sent news of this success to his brothers.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “Hitherto I-tê has been rather violent, but this time he\r\nhas acted wisely and I am very pleased.”\r\n\r\nThey rode out to welcome their brother.\r\n\r\n“You said I was too rough; how now?” said Fei to his brothers.\r\n\r\n“If I had not put you on your mettle you would not have evolved this\r\nstratagem,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nFei laughed. Then appeared the captive Liu Tai, in bonds. Yüan-tê at\r\nonce dismounted and loosed the cords, saying, “My young brother was\r\nrather nasty, but you must pardon him.”\r\n\r\nSo he was freed. He was taken into the city, his colleague was released\r\nand both were cared for.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said to them, “I could not help putting Chʻê Chou to death when\r\nhe tried to kill me, but Tsʻao Tsʻao took it as disaffection and sent\r\nyou two generals to punish me. I have received much kindness from him\r\nand certainly would not show ingratitude by killing you. I wish you to\r\nspeak for me and explain when you get back.”\r\n\r\n“We are deeply grateful that you spare our lives and we will certainly\r\ndo so in gratitude for what our wives and children owe you.”\r\n\r\nNext day the two leaders and their army were allowed to depart\r\nunscathed. But before they had got ten li from the boundary they heard\r\na mighty shouting and there appeared Chang Fei barring the road.\r\n\r\n“My brother made a mistake in letting you go: he did not understand.\r\nHow could he give freedom to two rebels?”\r\n\r\nThis made the two men quake with fear, but as the fierce-eyed warrior\r\nwith uplifted sword was bearing down upon them they heard another man\r\ngalloping up and shouting, “Do not behave so disgracefully!”\r\n\r\nThe newcomer was Kuan Yü and his appearance relieved the unhappy men of\r\nall fear.\r\n\r\n“Why do you stop them since our brother set them free?” cried he.\r\n\r\n“If they are let go to-day they will surely come back,” cried Fei.\r\n\r\n“Wait till they do, then you may kill them,” replied Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nThe two leaders with one voice cried, “Even if the Minister slay our\r\nwhole clan we will never come again. We pray you pardon us.”\r\n\r\nSaid Fei, “If Tsʻao Tsʻao himself had come I would have slain him. Not\r\na breastplate should have gone back. But for this time I leave you your\r\nheads.”\r\n\r\nClapping their hands to their heads the two men scuttled off while the\r\ntwo brothers returned to the city.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao will certainly come,” they said.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien said, “This is not a city that can hold out for long. We\r\nshould send part of our forces to Hsiaopʻei and guard Pʻeichʻêng as a\r\ncorner stone of our position.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê agreed and told off his brothers to guard Pʻeichʻêng whither he\r\nalso sent his two wives, the Ladies Kan and Mi. The former was a native\r\nof the place; the latter was Mi Chu’s sister.\r\n\r\nFour captains were left to defend Hsüchou and Yüan-tê with Chang Fei\r\nwent to Hsiaopʻei.\r\n\r\nThe two released leaders hastened home to Tsʻao Tsʻao and explained to\r\nhim that Liu Pei was not disaffected. But their master was exceeding\r\nangry with them, crying “You shameful traitors, what use are you?”\r\n\r\nHe roared to the lictors to take them away to instant execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n        How can a dog or a pig expect\r\n            To conquer in tiger strife?\r\n        Minnows and shrimps that with dragons contend\r\n            Already have done with life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of the two leaders will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMI HÊNG SLIPS HIS GARMENT AND RAILS AT TRAITORS:\r\nCRUEL PUNISHMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN CHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last chapter the two unsuccessful leaders Liu and\r\nWang were in danger of death. However, one of the advisers, Kʻung Jung,\r\nremonstrated with Tsʻao saying, “You knew these two were no match for\r\nLiu Pei and if you put them to death because they failed you will lose\r\nthe hearts of your men.”\r\n\r\nWherefore the death sentence was not executed but they were deprived of\r\nrank and status. Tsʻao next proposed to lead an army himself to attack\r\nLiu Pei, but the weather was too inclement. So it was settled to await\r\nthe return of spring. In the interval there would be time to arrange\r\npeace with Chang Hsiu and Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nWherefore Liu Yeh was sent to the former of these and in due time\r\nreached Hsiangchʻêng. He first had an interview with Chia Hsü, whereat\r\nhe dwelt upon Tsʻao’s virtues so that Hsü was impressed, kept him as a\r\nguest and undertook to smooth his way.\r\n\r\nSoon after he saw Chang Hsiu and spoke of the advantages of coming to\r\nterms with Tsʻao Tsʻao. While the discussion was in progress a\r\nmessenger from Yüan Shao was announced and he was called in. He\r\npresented letters and, when they also proposed terms of peace, Chia Hsü\r\nasked what their success had been lately against Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“The war had ceased for the moment on account of the winter,” replied\r\nthe messenger. “As you, General, and Liu Piao are both well reputed\r\nofficers of the State, I have been sent to request your help.”\r\n\r\nChia Hsü laughed, “You can return to your master and say that as he\r\ncould not brook rivalry of his brother he certainly would be sorely put\r\nto it with that of all the officers of the State.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was torn into fragments before the messenger’s face and he\r\nwas angrily bidden begone.\r\n\r\n“But his master, Yüan Shao, is stronger than Tsʻao Tsʻao,” protested\r\nChang Hsiu. “You have torn up his letter and are dismissing his man.\r\nWhat shall we say about such an insult should Yüan Shao come?”\r\n\r\n“Better join hands with Tsʻao Tsʻao,” said Chia Hsü.\r\n\r\n“But there is still between us an unavenged enmity, we could not suffer\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\nChia Hsü said, “There are three advantages in joining hands with Tsʻao.\r\nFirst, he has a command from the Emperor to restore peace. Secondly, as\r\nYüan Shao is so strong our little help to him will be despised, while\r\nwe shall loom large and be well treated by Tsʻao Tsʻao. Thirdly, Tsʻao\r\nis going to be Chief of the Feudal Lords and he will ignore all private\r\nfeuds in order to show his magnanimity to all the world. I hope,\r\nGeneral, you will see these things clearly and hesitate no longer.”\r\n\r\nChang Hsiu, now convinced, became more reasonable and recalled the\r\nmessenger, who, at the interview, extolled the many virtues of his\r\nmaster. “If the Minister had any thought of the old quarrel he would\r\nhardly have sent me to make friendly engagements: would he?” said he at\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nSo Chang and his adviser proceeded to the capital where formal\r\nsubmission was made. At the interview the visitor bowed low at the\r\nsteps, but Tsʻao Tsʻao, hastening forward, took him by the hand and\r\nraised him saying “Forget that little fault of mine, I pray you.”\r\n\r\nChang Hsiu received the title of Yang-wu General (“Prowess-in-War”\r\nGeneral) and Chia Hsü that of Chih Chin-wu (Controller of the Ways).\r\n\r\nTsʻao then directed his secretaries to draft letters inviting the\r\nsupport of Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nChia Hsü said, “Liu Ching-shêng loves to have to do with famous people.\r\nIf some famous scholar should be sent to him he would submit\r\nforthwith.”\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao enquired of Hsün Yu who was the best man to go as a messenger\r\nand he recommended Kʻung Jung. Tsʻao agreed and sent him to speak with\r\nthis officer. So he went to Kʻung, saying, “A scholar of reputation is\r\nrequired to act as a messenger of State; can you undertake this task?”\r\n\r\nKʻung Jung replied, “I have a certain friend, Mi Hêng, whose talents\r\nare ten times mine. He ought to be constantly at the Court of the\r\nEmperor and not merely be sent as a State messenger. I will recommend\r\nhim to the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nSo he wrote the following memorial:—\r\n\r\n“In ancient days, when the great waters were abroad, the Emperor\r\npondered over their regulation and he sought out men of talent from all\r\ndirections. In old time, when the Emperor Wu of the Hans desired to\r\nenlarge his borders, crowds of scholars responded to his call.\r\n\r\n“Intelligent and holy, Your Majesty ascended the throne. You have\r\nfallen upon evil days, but have been diligent, modest and untiring in\r\nyour efforts. Now the great mountains have sent forth spirits and men\r\nof genius appear.\r\n\r\n“I, your humble servant, know of a certain simple scholar, Mi Hêng by\r\nname, of Pʻingyüan, a young man of twenty-four. His moral character is\r\nexcellent, his talents eminent. As a youth he took a high place in\r\nstudy and penetrated the most secret arcana of learning. What he\r\nglanced at he could repeat, what he heard once he never forgot. He is\r\nnaturally high principled and his thoughts are divine. Hung-yang’s\r\nmental calculations and An-shih’s mnemonical feats compared with Mi\r\nHêng’s powers are no longer wonderful. Loyal, sincere, correct and\r\nstraight-forward, his ambition is unsullied. He regards the good with\r\ntrembling respect, he detests the evil with uncompromising hatred. Jên\r\nTso in unflinching candour, Shih Yü in severe rectitude, never\r\nsurpassed him.\r\n\r\n“Hundreds of hawks are not worth one osprey. If Mi Hêng be given a\r\nCourt appointment notable results must follow. Ready in debate, rapid\r\nin utterance, his overwhelming intelligence wells up in profusion; in\r\nthe solution of doubts and the unravelling of difficulties he has no\r\npeer.\r\n\r\n“In former days Chia I begged to be sent on trial to a vassal State to\r\nbe responsible for the arrest of Shan Yü; Chung Chün offered to bring\r\nthe Prince of Nanyüeh as with a pair of long reins. The generous\r\nconduct of these youths has been much admired. In our day Lu Tsui and\r\nYen Hsiang, remarkable for their talents, have been appointed among the\r\nsecretaries. And Mi Hêng is no less capable. Should he be got, then all\r\npossibilities may be realised; the dragon may curvet through the\r\ncelestial streets and soar along the Milky Way; fame will extend to the\r\npoles of the universe and hang in the firmament with rainbow glory. He\r\nwould be the glory of all the present Ministers and enhance the majesty\r\nof the Palace itself. The air Chun-tʻien will acquire new beauties and\r\nthe Palace will contain an excellent treasure. Men like Mi Hêng are but\r\nfew. As in the recitation of Chi-chʻu and the singing of Yang-o the\r\nmost skilful performers are sought, and such fleet horses as Fei-tʻu\r\nand Yao-miao were looked for by the famous judges of horses, Wang Liang\r\nand Pai Lo, so I, the humble one, dare not conceal this man. Your\r\nMajesty is careful in the selection of servants and should try him. Let\r\nhim be summoned as he is, simply clad in his serge dress, and should he\r\nnot appear worthy then may I be punished for the fault of deception.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor read the memorial and passed it to his Minister, who duly\r\nsummoned Mi Hêng. He came, but after his formal salutations were over\r\nhe was left standing and not invited to sit down. Looking up to heaven\r\nhe sighed deeply, saying, “Wide as is the universe it cannot produce\r\nthe man.”\r\n\r\n“Under my orders are scores of men whom the world call heroes. What do\r\nyou mean by saying there is not the man?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“I should be glad to hear who they are,” said Mi.\r\n\r\n“Hsün Yü and Hsün Yu, Kuo Chia and Chʻêng Yü are all men of profound\r\nskill and long views, superior to Hsiao Ho and Chʻên Pʻing; Chang Liao\r\nand Hsü Chu, Li Tien and Yo Chin are bravest of the brave, better than\r\nTsên Pʻêng and Ma Wu. Lü Chʻien and Man Chʻung are my secretaries, Yü\r\nChin and Hsü Huang are my van-leaders; Hsiahou Tun is one of the\r\nworld’s marvels and Tsʻao Tzŭ-hsiao is the most successful leader of\r\nthe age. Now say you there are not the men?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you are quite mistaken,” said Mi Hêng with a smile. “I know all\r\nthese things you call men. Hsün Yü is qualified to pose at a funeral or\r\nask after a sick man. Hsün Yu is fit to be a tomb guardian. Chʻêng Yü\r\nmight be sent to shut doors and bolt windows, and Kuo Chia is a reciter\r\nof poems; Chang Liao might beat drums and clang gongs; Hsü Chu might\r\nlead cattle to pasture; Yo Chin would make a fair confidential clerk of\r\nthe Court; Li Tien could carry despatches and notices; Lü Chʻien would\r\nbe a fair armourer; Man Chʻung could be sent to drink wine and eat\r\nbrewers’ grains; Yü Chin might be of use to carry planks and build\r\nwalls; Hsü Huang might be employed to kill pigs and slay dogs; Hsiahou\r\nTun should be styled ‘Whole Body’ General and Tsʻao Tzŭ-hsiao should be\r\ncalled ‘Money-grubbing Prefect.’ As for the remainder, they are mere\r\nclothes-horses, rice-sacks, wine butts, flesh bags.”\r\n\r\n“And what special gifts have you?” said Tsʻao Tsʻao angrily.\r\n\r\n“I know everything in heaven above and the earth beneath. I am\r\nconversant with the Three Religions and the Nine Systems of Philosophy.\r\nI could make my prince the rival of Yao and Shun and I myself could\r\ncompare in virtue with Kʻung and Yen. Can I discuss on even terms with\r\ncommon people?”\r\n\r\nNow Chang Liao was present and he raised his sword to strike down the\r\nimpudent visitor who spoke thus to his master, but Tsʻao Tsʻao said, “I\r\nwant another drummer boy to play on occasions of congratulation in the\r\nCourt. I will confer this office upon him.”\r\n\r\nInstead of indignantly declining this Mi Hêng accepted the position and\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\n“He spoke very impertinently,” said Liao; “Why did you not put him to\r\ndeath?”\r\n\r\n“He has something of a reputation; empty, but people have heard of him\r\nand so, if I put him to death, they would say I was intolerant. As he\r\nthinks he has ability I have made him a drummer to mortify him.”\r\n\r\nSoon after Tsʻao instituted a banquet in the capital at which the\r\nguests were many. The drums were to be played and the old drummers were\r\nordered to wear new clothes. But the new drummer took his place with\r\nthe other musicians clad in old and worn garments. The piece chosen was\r\nYü-yang (or “Fishing”) and from the earliest taps on the drum the\r\neffect was exquisite, profound as the notes from metal and stone. The\r\nperformance stirred deeply the emotions of every guest, some even shed\r\ntears. Seeing all eyes turned on the shabby performer the attendants\r\nsaid, “Why did you not put on your new uniform?”\r\n\r\nMi Hêng turned to them, slipped off his frayed and torn robe and stood\r\nthere in full view, naked as he was born. The assembled guests covered\r\ntheir faces. Then the drummer composedly drew on his nether garments.\r\n\r\n“Why do you behave so rudely at Court?” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“To flout one’s prince and insult one’s superiors is the real\r\nrudeness,” cried Mi Hêng. “I bare my natural body as an emblem of my\r\npurity.”\r\n\r\n“So you are pure! And who is foul?”\r\n\r\n“You do not distinguish between the wise and the foolish; which is to\r\nhave foul vision; you have never read the Odes or the Histories, which\r\nis to have foul speech; you are deaf to honest words, which is to have\r\nfoul ears; you are unable to reconcile antiquity with to-day, which is\r\nto be foul without; you cannot tolerate the nobles, which is to be foul\r\nwithin; you harbour thoughts of rebellion, which is to have a foul\r\nheart. I am the most famous scholar in the world and you make me a\r\ndrummer boy, that is as Yang Huo belittling Chung-ni (Confucius) or\r\nTsang Tsʻang vilifying Mêng, the Philosopher (Mencius). You desire to\r\nbe chief and arbitrator of the great nobles, yet you treat me thus!”\r\n\r\nNow Kʻung Jung who had recommended Mi Hêng for employment was among the\r\nguests and he feared for the life of his friend. Wherefore he tried to\r\ncalm the storm.\r\n\r\n“Mi Hêng is only guilty of a misdemeanour like Hsü Mi’s,” cried he. “He\r\nis not a man likely to disturb your dreams, illustrious Prince.”\r\n\r\nPointing to Mi Hêng the Minister said, “I will send you to Chingchou as\r\nmy messenger and if Liu Piao surrender to me I will give you a post at\r\nCourt.”\r\n\r\nBut Hêng was unwilling to go. So Tsʻao Tsʻao bade two of his men\r\nprepare three horses and they set Hêng on the middle one and dragged\r\nhim along the road between them.\r\n\r\nIt is also related that a great number of officers of all ranks\r\nassembled at the east gate to see the messenger start. Hsün Yü said,\r\n“When Mi Hêng comes we will not rise to salute him.”\r\n\r\nSo when Hêng came, dismounted and entered the waiting room, they all\r\nsat stiff and silent. Mi Hêng uttered a loud cry.\r\n\r\n“What is that for?” said Hsün Yü.\r\n\r\n“Should not one cry out when one enters a coffin?” said Mi Hêng.\r\n\r\n“We may be corpses,” cried they altogether, “but you are a wandering\r\nghost.”\r\n\r\n“I am a Minister of Han and not a partizan of Tsʻao’s,” cried he. “You\r\ncannot say I have no head.”\r\n\r\nThey were angry enough to kill him, but Hsün Yü checked them. “He is a\r\npaltry fellow, it is not worth soiling your blades with his blood.”\r\n\r\n“I am paltry, am I? Yet I have the soul of a man and you are mere\r\nworms,” said Mi Hêng.\r\n\r\nThey went their ways all very angry. Mi Hêng went on his journey and\r\npresently reached Chingchou, where he saw Liu Piao. After that, under\r\npretence of extolling his virtue, he lampooned Piao, who was annoyed\r\nand sent him to Chianghsia to see Huang Tsu.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not put the fellow to death for lampooning you?” said one\r\nto Liu Piao.\r\n\r\n“You see he shamed Tsʻao Tsʻao, but Tsʻao did not kill him as he feared\r\nto lose popular favour. So he sent him to me, thinking to borrow my\r\nhand to slay him and so suffer the loss of my good name. I have sent\r\nhim on to Huang Tsu to let Tsʻao see that I understood.”\r\n\r\nHis clever caution met with general praise. At that time a messenger\r\nfrom Yüan Shao was also there with certain proposals for an alliance\r\nand it was necessary to decide which side to espouse. All the advisers\r\ncame together to consider the question. Then the secretary, Han Sung,\r\nsaid, “As you have now two offers you can please yourself and choose\r\nyour own way to destroy your enemies, for if one refuse you can follow\r\nthe other. Now Tsʻao Tsʻao is an able general and has many capable men\r\nin his train. It looks as though he may destroy Yüan Shao and then move\r\nhis armies across the river. I fear, General, you would be unable then\r\nto withstand him. That being so it would be wise to support Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, who will treat you with respect.”\r\n\r\nLiu Piao replied, “You go to the capital and see how things tend. That\r\nwill help me to decide.”\r\n\r\nHan Sung said, “The positions of master and servant are clearly\r\ndefined. Now I am your man prepared to go all lengths for you and obey\r\nyou to the last, whether in serving the Emperor or in following Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao. But lest there should be any doubt you must remember that if the\r\nEmperor gives me any office then I shall become his servant and shall\r\nnot be ready to face death for you.”\r\n\r\n“You go and find out what you can. I have ideas in my mind.”\r\n\r\nSo Han Sung took his leave and went to the capital, where he saw Tsʻao.\r\nTsʻao gave him rank and made him Prefect of Lingling. The adviser Hsün\r\nYü remonstrated, saying, “This man came to spy out how things were\r\nmoving. He has done nothing to deserve reward and yet you give him an\r\noffice like this. There were no such suspicious rumours connected with\r\npoor Mi Hêng and yet you sent him off and would never test his powers.”\r\n\r\n“Mi Hêng shamed me too deeply before all the world. I am going to\r\nborrow Liu Piao’s hand to remove him. And you need say no more,” said\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao sent Han Sung back to his former master to tell him what had\r\nhappened. He came and was full of praise for the virtues of the Court\r\nand was keen on persuading Piao to espouse that side. Then Liu Piao\r\nsuddenly turned angry, charged him with treachery and threatened him\r\nwith death.\r\n\r\n“You turn your back on me;” cried Han Sung. “I did not betray you.”\r\n\r\nKʻuai Liang remarked that Han Sung had foretold this possibility before\r\nhe left, it was only what he expected. Liu Piao, who was just and\r\nreasonable, went no further.\r\n\r\nPresently came the news that Mi Hêng had been put to death by Huang Tsu\r\non account of a quarrel begun over the wine cups. Both being worse for\r\nliquor they had begun to discuss the worth of people.\r\n\r\n“You were in Hsütu,” said Huang. “Who was there of worth?”\r\n\r\n“The big boy was Kʻung Jung and the little one Yang Tê-tsu. There was\r\nno one else to count.”\r\n\r\n“What am I like?” said Huang.\r\n\r\n“You are like a god in a temple; you sit still and receive sacrifice,\r\nbut the lack of intelligence is pitiful.”\r\n\r\n“Do you regard me as a mere image?” cried Huang Tsu, angry.\r\n\r\nSo he put the impudent speaker to death. Even at the very point of\r\ndeath Mi never ceased his railing and abuse.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” sighed Liu Piao, when he heard of his fate. He had the victim\r\nhonourably interred near Yingwuchou. And a later poet wrote of him:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Huang Tsu could brook no rival; at his word\r\n            Mi Hêng met death beneath the cruel sword.\r\n        His grave on Parrot Isle may yet be seen,\r\n            The river flowing past it, coldly green.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao heard of the young man’s death with pleasure. “The putrid\r\nbookworm has just cut himself up with his own sharp tongue,” said he.\r\n\r\nAs there was no sign of Liu Piao coming to join him, Tsʻao Tsʻao began\r\nto think of coercion. The adviser, Hsün Yü, dissuaded him from this\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “Yüan Shao is not subjugated, Liu Pei is not destroyed. To\r\nattack Liu Piao would be to neglect the vital to care for the\r\nimmaterial. Destroy the two chief enemies first and Chiang-han is yours\r\nat one blow.”\r\n\r\nAnd Tsʻao Tsʻao took the advice.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Yüan-tê, Tung Chʻêng and his fellow conspirators\r\ndid nothing else day or night but try to evolve plans for the\r\ndestruction of their enemy. But they could see no chance to attack. At\r\nthe new year audience Tsʻao Tsʻao was odiously arrogant and overweening\r\nand the chief conspirator’s disgust was so intense that he fell ill.\r\nHearing of his indisposition the Emperor sent the Court physician to\r\nsee his “State Uncle.”\r\n\r\nThe Court physician at this time was a native of Loyang, named Chi\r\nTʻai, more commonly known as Chi Pʻing. He was very famous. He devoted\r\nhimself wholly to the treatment of his Court patient. Living in his\r\nPalace and seeing him at all times he soon found that some secret grief\r\nwas sorely troubling Tung Chʻêng. But he dared not ask questions.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when the physician was just taking his leave, Tung Chʻêng\r\nkept him and the two men had supper together. They sat talking for some\r\ntime and Tung by and by dropped off to sleep dressed as he was.\r\n\r\nPresently Wang Tzŭ-fu and the others were announced. As they were\r\ncoming in Wang cried, “Our business is settled!”\r\n\r\n“I should be glad to hear how,” said Tung.\r\n\r\n“Liu Piao has joined Yüan Shao and fifty legions are on their way here\r\nby different routes. More than this, Ma Tʻêng and Han Sui are coming\r\nfrom the north with seventy-two legions. Tsʻao Tsʻao has moved every\r\nsoldier outside Hsütu to meet the combined armies. There is a great\r\nbanquet in the Palace to-night and if we get together our young men and\r\nslaves, we can muster more than a thousand, and we can surround the\r\npalace, while Tsʻao Tsʻao is at the banquet, and finish him off. We\r\nmust not miss this.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng was more than delighted. He called his slaves and armed\r\nthem, put on his own armour and mounted his horse. The conspirators\r\nmet, as they had arranged, just at the inner gate. It was the first\r\nwatch. The small army marched straight in, Tung Chʻêng leading with his\r\nsword drawn. His intended victim was at table in one of the private\r\nrooms. Tung rushed in crying, “Tsʻao you rebel, stay!” and dashed at\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao who fell at the first blow.\r\n\r\nAnd just then he woke up and found it was all a dream, a dream as\r\nunreal as that of life in the kingdom of the ants. But his mouth was\r\nstill full of curses.\r\n\r\n“Do you really wish to destroy Tsʻao Tsʻao?” said Chi Pʻing, going\r\nforward to his half awakened patient.\r\n\r\nThis brought him to his senses. Tung stopped, terror stricken, and made\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\n“Do not be frightened, O Uncle,” said the doctor, “Although I am a\r\nphysician I am also a man, and I never forget my Emperor. You have\r\nseemed sad for many days but I have never ventured to ask the reason.\r\nNow you have shown it in your dream and I know your real feelings. If I\r\ncan be of any use I will help. Nothing can daunt me.”\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng covered his face and wept. “I fear you may not be true to\r\nme,” cried he.\r\n\r\nChi Pʻing at once bit off a finger as a pledge of his faith. And then\r\nhis host and patient brought forth the decree he had received in the\r\ngirdle. “I am afraid our schemes will come to nought,” said he. “Liu\r\nYüan-tê and Ma Tʻêng are gone and there is nothing we can do. That was\r\nthe real reason I fell ill.”\r\n\r\n“It is not worth troubling you gentlemen with; for Tsʻao’s life lies in\r\nthese hands of mine,” said Chi Pʻing.\r\n\r\n“How can that be?”\r\n\r\n“Because he is often ill with deep-seated pain in his head. When this\r\ncomes on he sends for me. When next he calls me I only have to give him\r\none dose and he will certainly die. We do not want any weapons.”\r\n\r\n“If only you could do it! You would be the saviour of the Dynasty; it\r\ndepends upon you.”\r\n\r\nThen Chi Pʻing went away leaving his late patient a happy man. Tung\r\nstrolled into the garden and there he saw one of his slaves, Tsʻin\r\nChʻing-tʻung, whispering with one of the waiting maids in a dark\r\ncorner. This annoyed him and he called his attendants to seize them. He\r\nwould have put them to death but for the intervention of his wife. At\r\nher request he spared their lives but both were beaten, and the lad was\r\nthrown into a dungeon. Sulky at his treatment the slave broke out of\r\nthe cell in the night, climbed over the wall and went straight to Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s palace, where he betrayed the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao at once had him taken into a secret chamber and questioned\r\nhim. He gave the names of the conspirators and told as much as he knew\r\nof their doings. He said his master had a piece of white silk, with\r\nwriting on it, but he did not know what it meant. Lately Chi Pʻing had\r\nbitten off one of his fingers as a pledge of fidelity. He had seen\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe runaway slave was kept in a secret part of the Palace while his\r\nlate master, only knowing that he had run away, took no special means\r\nto find him.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Tsʻao feigned a headache and sent for Chi Pʻing as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n“The rebel is done for,” thought Chi Pʻing, and he made a secret\r\npackage of poison which he took with him to the palace of the Minister.\r\nHe found Tsʻao in bed. The patient bade the doctor prepare a potion for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“One draught will cure this disease,” said Pʻing. He bade them bring\r\nhim a pipkin and he prepared the potion in the room. When it had\r\nsimmered for some time and was half finished the poison was added, and\r\nsoon after the physician presented the draught. Tsʻao Tsʻao, knowing it\r\nwas poisoned, made excuses and would not swallow it.\r\n\r\n“You should take it hot,” said the doctor. “Then there will be a gentle\r\nperspiration and you will be better.”\r\n\r\n“You are a scholar,” said Tsʻao, sitting up, “and know what is the\r\ncorrect thing to do. When the master is ill and takes drugs, the\r\nattendant first tastes them; when a man is ill, his son first tastes\r\nthe medicine. You are my confidant and should drink first. Then I will\r\nswallow the remainder.”\r\n\r\n“Medicine is to treat disease; what is the use of any one’s tasting\r\nit?” said Pʻing. But he guessed now the conspiracy had been discovered\r\nso he dashed forward, seized Tsʻao Tsʻao by the ear and tried to pour\r\nthe potion down his throat. Tsʻao pushed it away and it spilt. The\r\nbricks upon which it fell were split asunder. Before Tsʻao Tsʻao could\r\nspeak his servants had already seized his assailant.\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao, “I am not ill: I only wanted to test you. So you really\r\nthought to poison me.”\r\n\r\nHe sent for a score of sturdy gaolers who carried off the prisoner to\r\nthe inner apartments to be interrogated. Tsʻao took his seat in a\r\npavilion and the hapless physician, tightly bound, was thrown to the\r\nground before him. The prisoner maintained a bold front.\r\n\r\nTsʻao said “I thought you were a physician; how dared you try to poison\r\nme? Some one incited you to this crime and if you tell me I will pardon\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You are a rebel; you flout your Prince and injure your betters. The\r\nwhole world wishes to kill you. Do you think I am the only one?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao again and again pressed the prisoner to tell what he knew, but he\r\nonly replied that no one had sent him; it was his own desire.\r\n\r\n“And I have failed and I can but die,” added he.\r\n\r\nTsʻao angrily bade the gaolers give him a severe beating and they\r\nflogged him for two watches. His skin hung in tatters, the flesh was\r\nbattered and the blood from his wounds ran down the steps. Then fearing\r\nhe might die and his evidence be lost, Tsʻao Tsʻao bade them cease and\r\nremove him. They took him off to a quiet place where he might recover\r\nsomewhat.\r\n\r\nHaving issued orders to prepare a banquet for next day Tsʻao invited\r\nall the conspirators thereto. Tung Chʻêng was the only one who excused\r\nhimself, saying he was unwell. The others dared not stay away as they\r\nfelt they would be suspected.\r\n\r\nTables were laid in the private apartments and after several courses\r\nthe host said, “There is not much to amuse us to-day but I have a man\r\nto show you that will sober you.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him in,” he said, turning to the gaolers, and the hapless Chi\r\nPʻing appeared, securely fastened in a wooden collar. He was placed\r\nwhere all could see him.\r\n\r\n“You officials do not know that this man is connected with a gang of\r\nevil-doers who desire to overturn the government and even injure me.\r\nHowever Heaven has defeated their plans, but I desire that you should\r\nhear his evidence.”\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao ordered the lictors to beat their prisoner. They did so till\r\nhe lay unconscious, when they revived him by spraying water over his\r\nface. As soon as he came to he glared at his oppressor and ground his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao you rebel! what are you waiting for? Why not kill me?”\r\ncried Chi.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao replied, “The conspirators were only six at first; you made\r\nthe seventh.”\r\n\r\nHere the prisoner broke in with more abuse, while Wang Tzŭ-fu and the\r\nothers exchanged glances looking as though they were sitting on a rug\r\nfull of needles. Tsʻao continued his torture of the prisoner, beating\r\nhim into unconsciousness and reviving him with cold water, the victim\r\ndisdaining to ask mercy. Finally Tsʻao realised he would incriminate\r\nnone of his accomplices and so he told the gaolers to remove him.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the banquet, when the guests were dispersing, four of\r\nthem, the four conspirators, were invited to remain behind to supper.\r\nThey were terrified so that their souls seemed no longer to inhabit\r\ntheir bodies, but there was no saying nay to the invitation. Presently\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said, “Still there is something I want to speak about so I\r\nhave asked you to stay for a time longer. I do not know what you four\r\nhave been arranging with Tung Chʻêng.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all,” said Wang.\r\n\r\n“And what is written on the white silk?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThey all said they knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao ordered the runaway slave to be brought in. As soon as he\r\ncame Wang said, “Well, what have you seen and where?”\r\n\r\nThe slave Chʻing-tʻung replied, “You six very carefully chose retired\r\nplaces to talk in and you secretly signed a white roll. You cannot deny\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nWang replied, “This miserable creature was punished for misbehaviour\r\nwith one of Uncle Tung’s maids and now because of that he slanders his\r\nmaster. You must not listen to him.”\r\n\r\n“Chi Pʻing tried to pour poison down my throat. Who told him to do that\r\nif it was not Tung?”\r\n\r\nThey all said they knew nothing about who it was.\r\n\r\n“So far,” said Tsʻao, “matters are only beginning and there is a chance\r\nof forgiveness. But if the thing grows, it will be difficult not to\r\ntake notice of it.”\r\n\r\nThe whole four vigorously denied that any plot existed. However Tsʻao\r\ncalled up his henchmen and the four men were put into confinement.\r\n\r\nNext day Tsʻao Tsʻao with a large following went to the State Uncle’s\r\nPalace to ask after his health. Chʻêng came out to receive his visitor,\r\nwho at once said, “Why did you not come last night?”\r\n\r\n“I am not quite well yet and have to be very careful about going out,”\r\nreplied Chʻêng.\r\n\r\n“One might say you were suffering from national sorrow, eh?” said\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nChʻêng started. Tsʻao continued, “Have you heard of the Chi Pʻing\r\naffair?”\r\n\r\n“No; what is it?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao smiled coldly. “How can it be you do not know?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao turned to his attendants and told them to bring in the prisoner\r\nwhile he went on talking to his host about his illness.\r\n\r\nTung Chʻêng was much put about and knew not what to do. Soon the\r\ngaolers led in the physician to the steps of the hall. At once the\r\nbound man began to rail at Tsʻao as rebel and traitor.\r\n\r\n“This man,” said Tsʻao, pointing to Chi Pʻing, “has implicated Wang\r\nTzŭ-fu and three others, all of whom are now under arrest. There is one\r\nmore whom I have not caught yet.”\r\n\r\n“Who sent you to poison me?” continued he, turning toward the\r\nphysician. “Quick, tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven sent me to slay a traitor.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao angrily ordered them to beat him again, but there was no part of\r\nhis body that could be beaten. Tung Chʻêng sat looking at him, his\r\nheart feeling as if transfixed with a dagger.\r\n\r\n“You were born with ten fingers; how is it you have now only nine?”\r\n\r\nChi Pʻing replied, “I bit off one as a pledge when I swore to slay a\r\ntraitor.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao told them to bring a knife and they lopped off his other nine\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n“Now they are all off; that will teach you to make pledges.”\r\n\r\n“Still I have a mouth that can swallow a traitor and a tongue that can\r\ncurse him,” said Chi Pʻing.\r\n\r\nTsʻao told them to cut out his tongue.\r\n\r\nChi Pʻing said, “Do not. I cannot endure any more punishment. I shall\r\nhave to speak out. Loosen my bonds.”\r\n\r\n“Loose them. There is no reason why not,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThey loosed him. As soon as he was free Chi Pʻing stood up, turned his\r\nface toward the Emperor’s Palace and bowed, saying, “It is Heaven’s\r\nwill that thy servant has been unable to remove the evil,” then he\r\nturned and fell dead on the steps.\r\n\r\nHis body was quartered and exposed.\r\n\r\nThis happened in the first month of the fifth year of “Established\r\nTranquillity” and a certain historian wrote a poem:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        There lived in Han a simple leech.\r\n            No warrior, yet brave\r\n        Enough to risk his very life\r\n            His Emperor to save.\r\n        Alas! he failed; but lasting fame\r\n            Is his; he feared not death;\r\n        He cursed the traitorous Minister\r\n            Unto his latest breath.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing his victim had passed beyond the realm of punishment Tsʻao had\r\nthe slave led in.\r\n\r\n“Do you know this man, Uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Tung Chʻêng. “So the runaway slave is here; he ought to be\r\nput to death.”\r\n\r\n“He just told me of your treachery; he is my witness,” said Tsʻao. “Who\r\nwould dare kill him?”\r\n\r\n“How can you, the first Minister of State, heed the unsupported tale of\r\nan absconding slave?”\r\n\r\n“But I have Wang and the others in prison,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. “And how\r\ncan you rebut their evidence?”\r\n\r\nHe then called in the remainder of his followers and ordered them to\r\nsearch Tung Chʻêng’s bedroom. They did so and found the decree that had\r\nbeen given him in the girdle and the pledge signed by the conspirators.\r\n\r\n“You mean rat!” cried Tsʻao, “you dared do this?”\r\n\r\nHe gave orders to arrest the whole household without exception. Then he\r\nreturned to his Palace with the incriminating documents and called all\r\nhis advisers together to discuss the dethronement of the Emperor and\r\nthe setting up of a successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Many decrees, blood written, have issued, accomplishing nothing\r\n    One inscribed pledge was fraught with mountains of sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader who wishes to know the fate of the Emperor must read the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMURDER OF A KUEI-FEI:\r\nLIU PEI DEFEATED; FLIGHT TO YÜAN SHAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter closed with the discovery of the “girdle” decree and\r\nthe assembly of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s advisers to consider the deposition of\r\nthe Emperor Hsien. Chʻêng Yü spoke strongly against this saying,\r\n“Illustrious Sir, the means by which you impress the world and direct\r\nthe government is the command of the House of Han. In these times of\r\nturmoil and rivalry among the nobles such a step as the deposition of\r\nthe ruler will certainly bring about civil war and is much to be\r\ndeprecated.”\r\n\r\nAfter reflection Tsʻao Tsʻao abandoned the project. But Tung Chʻêng’s\r\nplot was not to go unpunished. All five of the conspirators with every\r\nmember of their households, seven hundred at least, were taken and put\r\nto death at one or another of the gates of the city. The people wept at\r\nsuch merciless and wholesale slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A secret decree in a girdle sewn,\r\n        In red blood written, the Emperor’s own,\r\n        To the staunch and faithful Tung addressed,\r\n        Who had saved him once when enemies pressed,\r\n        And who, sore grieved at his Sovereign’s fate,\r\n        Expressed in dreams his ceaseless hate,\r\n        Carried misfortune and death in its train\r\n        But glory to him who died in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother poet wrote of the sad fate of Wang Tzŭ-fu and his friends:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Greatheartedly these signed the silken roll,\r\n        And pledged themselves to save their King from shame.\r\n        Alas! black death of them took heavy toll,\r\n        To write their names upon the roll of fame.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the slaughter of the conspirators and their whole households did\r\nnot appease the wrath of the cruel Minister. The Emperor’s Kuei-fei was\r\na sister of Tung Chʻêng and, sword in hand, Tsʻao Tsʻao went into the\r\npalace determined to slay her also. The Emperor cherished her tenderly,\r\nthe more so as she was then in the fifth month of pregnancy. That day,\r\nas they often did, the Emperor, his Consort and the Kuei-fei were\r\nsitting in their private apartments secretly talking of the decree\r\nentrusted to Tung Chʻêng and asking each other why nothing seemed to\r\nhave been done. The sudden appearance of the angry Minister, armed as\r\nhe was, frightened them greatly.\r\n\r\n“Does Your Majesty know that Tung Chʻêng conspired against me?” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n“Tung Cho died long ago,” replied the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“Not Tung Cho; Tung Chʻêng,” roared Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s heart trembled but he gasped out, “Really I did not\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“So the cut finger and the blood written decree are all forgotten, eh?”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was silent. Tsʻao bade his lictors seize the Kuei-fei. The\r\nEmperor interposed asking pity for her condition.\r\n\r\n“If Heaven had not interposed and defeated the plot I should be a dead\r\nman. How could I leave this woman to work evil to me by and by?”\r\n\r\nSaid the Emperor, “Immure her in one of the palaces till her\r\nconfinement. Do not harm her now.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to spare her offspring to avenge the mother?” said\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\n“I pray that my body may be spared mutilation and not put to shame,”\r\nsaid Tung Kuei-fei.\r\n\r\nTsʻao bade his men show her the white silk cord. The Emperor wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n“Do not hate me in the realms below the Nine Springs,” said the Emperor\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nHis tears fell like rain. The Empress Fu also joined in the lament, but\r\nTsʻao said, “You are behaving like a lot of children,” and told the\r\nlictors to take her away and strangle her in the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In vain had the fair girl found favour in the sight of her lord,\r\n    She died, and the fruit of her womb perished.\r\n    Stern and calm her lord sat, powerless to save,\r\n    Hiding his face while tears gushed forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen leaving the palace Tsʻao gave strict orders to the keepers saying\r\n“Any one of the Imperial relatives by marriage who enter the Palace\r\nwill be put to death, and the guards will share the same punishment for\r\nlack of zeal.”\r\n\r\nTo make more sure he appointed three companies of Imperial Guards from\r\nhis own men and appointed Tsʻao Hung to the command.\r\n\r\nThen said Tsʻao to his counsellor, Chʻêng Yü, “The conspirators in the\r\ncapital have been removed, it is true, but there are yet two others, Ma\r\nTʻêng and Liu Pei. These must not be left.”\r\n\r\nChʻêng Yü replied, “Ma Tʻêng is strong in the west and would not be\r\neasily captured. He might be enticed to the capital by suave words and\r\nkindly praises, when he would be at your mercy. The other is at\r\nHsüchou, strongly posted, and not to be lightly attacked. More than\r\nthis, Yüan Shao is at Kuantu and his one desire is to attack you. Any\r\nattempt on the east will send Liu Pei to him for help and he will come\r\nhere at once. Then what will you do?”\r\n\r\n“You are at fault,” replied Tsʻao Tsʻao. “Liu Pei is a bold warrior and\r\nif we wait till he is fully fledged and winged, he will be more\r\ndifficult to deal with. Shao may be strong but he is not to be feared.\r\nHe is too undecided to act.”\r\n\r\nAs they were discussing these things Kuo Chia came in and Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nsuddenly referred the matter to him.\r\n\r\n“If I attack Liu Pei, then Yüan Shao is to be feared: what do you think\r\nof it?”\r\n\r\n“Shao by nature is dilatory and hesitating and his various advisers are\r\njealous of each other. He is not to be feared. Liu Pei is getting\r\ntogether a new army and has not yet won their hearts. You could settle\r\nthe east in one battle.”\r\n\r\nThis advice being in harmony with Tsʻao Tsʻao’s own opinion was\r\npleasing to him and he prepared an army of twenty legions, to move in\r\nfive divisions against Hsüchou.\r\n\r\nScouts took the news of these preparations to Hsüchou. Sun Chʻien first\r\nwent to Hsiapʻi to tell Kuan Yü and then went to Hsiaopʻei to tell\r\nYüan-tê. The two discussed the position and decided that help must be\r\nsought. So letters were written to Yüan Shao and given to Sun Chʻien,\r\nwho went north, sought Tʻien Fêng and asked him to take him into the\r\npresence of Yüan Shao. He was introduced and presented his letters.\r\n\r\nBut Yüan Shao was of melancholy countenance and his dress was all awry.\r\nTʻien Fêng said, “Why this disarray, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“I am about to die,” replied Shao.\r\n\r\n“But why do you utter such words?”\r\n\r\n“I have five sons, but only the youngest is clever enough to understand\r\nmy ideas. Now he is suffering from a disease which places his life in\r\njeopardy. Think you that I have any heart to talk over any other\r\naffairs?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Tʻien Fêng, “the present combination of circumstances is\r\nunparalleled. Tsʻao Tsʻao is going to attack the east and Hsüchʻang\r\nwill be empty. You can enter it with a few volunteers and so perform\r\ngood service to the Emperor and save the people from sorrow. You have\r\nonly to make up your mind to act.”\r\n\r\n“I know the chance is excellent but I am worried and distressed and\r\nfear failure.”\r\n\r\n“What are you distressed about?” said Fêng.\r\n\r\n“Among my sons only this special one is remarkable and if anything\r\nhappens I am done.”\r\n\r\nThus it became evident that no army would be despatched. In\r\nconfirmation of this Yüan said to Sun Chʻien, “Go home and tell Yüan-tê\r\nthe real reason and say that if anything untoward happen he can come\r\nover to me and I will find some means of helping him.”\r\n\r\nTʻien Fêng struck the ground with his staff. “It is such a pity!” cried\r\nhe. “Just as an unique opportunity presents itself everything is\r\nspoiled by the illness of a child.”\r\n\r\nHe went out. Sun Chʻien saw that no help could be hoped for and set out\r\nto return. When he had arrived and related what he had seen Yüan-tê was\r\nquite alarmed and asked what could be done.\r\n\r\n“Do not be troubled, brother,” said Chang Fei. “We can destroy Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao merely by a sudden attack before his army shall have time to\r\ncamp.”\r\n\r\n“That would be according to the rules of war,” said Yüan-tê. “You have\r\nalways been a bold warrior and that move against Liu Tai shows that you\r\nare becoming a strategist too.”\r\n\r\nSo he gave his younger brother command of enough men to carry out his\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nNow while Tsʻao Tsʻao was in the midst of his march toward Hsiaopʻei a\r\ntornado sprang up and the howling gale tore down one of the banners and\r\nbroke the staff. Tsʻao Tsʻao called together his advisers and leaders\r\nto ask them what this portended. Hsün Yü said, “From what direction was\r\nthe wind at the time and what was the colour of the flag?”\r\n\r\n“The wind was from the south-east and the flag was blue and red.”\r\n\r\n“There is only one interpretation; there will be a raid on the camp\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao nodded. At that moment Mao Chih entered and reported a similar\r\nincident. Tsʻao asked him the portent.\r\n\r\n“My foolishness tells me that it means a night raid,” replied he.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Alas for the weakness of this descendant of kings!\r\n        He placed his faith on a night raid,\r\n        But the broken staff of a banner warned his enemy.\r\n        Why should the ancient of days favour the wicked?\r\n\r\n\r\n“This is evidently providence,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao and he began to make\r\npreparations. He told off nine bodies of men to take stations, leaving\r\nonly one of them as if camped while he placed the others in ambush at\r\neight points.\r\n\r\nThere was but little moonlight as Yüan-tê and Chang Fei marched their\r\nrespective armies toward Tsʻao Tsʻao’s camp. They had left Sun Chʻien\r\nto guard Hsiaopʻei. Chang Fei, since he was the originator of the\r\nstratagem, led the way with some light horse. As they drew near\r\neverything seemed very quiet and no one seemed moving. Then suddenly\r\nlights flashed out all about them and Chang Fei saw he had fallen into\r\na trap. At once from all the eight directions came out the ambushed\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nChang Fei, dashing this way and rushing that, guarding his van and\r\nprotecting his rear, vainly tried to clear himself. The soldiers he\r\nhad, being originally Tsʻao Tsʻao’s men, soon gave in and returned to\r\ntheir old leader. The position became very desperate.\r\n\r\nChang Fei met Hsü Huang and engaged him but his rear was also attacked\r\nby Yo Chin. At length he cut his own way out and with a half score of\r\nhis men started to return to Hsiaopʻei. The retreat was cut off. He\r\nthought to make for Hsüchou but felt certain that way was also barred.\r\nNo other way seemed open and so he made for the Mangyang Hills.\r\n\r\nAs Yüan-tê drew near the camp he intended to attack he heard the din of\r\nbattle. Then he was attacked in the rear and very soon had lost half\r\nhis force. Next Hsiahou Tun came to attack. Thereupon Yüan-tê bolted.\r\nHe was pursued by Hsiahou Yüan. Presently he looked about him and found\r\nhe had less than half a hundred men following him. He set his face in\r\nthe direction of Hsiaopʻei.\r\n\r\nBut before long he saw that place was in flames. So he changed his plan\r\nand went toward Hsiapʻi. However he found the whole countryside full of\r\nthe enemy and he could not get through. So he bethought himself of the\r\npromise of Yüan Shao, that he would find refuge if things went agley,\r\nand determined to go to him till he could form some other plan.\r\nWherefore he took the Chʻingchou road. But it also was blocked and he\r\nwent into the open country and made his way north, not without being\r\npursued and losing the remainder of his few followers.\r\n\r\nHe hastened toward Chʻingchou, travelling three hundred li a day. When\r\nhe reached the city and summoned the gate the guards asked who he was\r\nand they told the governor, who was Yüan Shao’s eldest son, Tʻan. Yüan\r\nTʻan was greatly surprised, but he opened the gates and went to meet\r\nYüan-tê, whom he treated with due consideration.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei told the story of his defeat and said he wished for harbour. He\r\nwas given suitable quarters and hospitably entertained, while the young\r\nman wrote to inform his father. Then he provided an escort and sent\r\nYüan-tê on his journey as far as the boundary of Pʻingyüan.\r\n\r\nAt Yehchün he was met by Yüan Shao in person, with a great escort.\r\nYüan-tê made a humble obeisance which Yüan Shao hastened to return and\r\nsaid, “I have been very distressed that, on account of my son’s\r\nillness, I did not come to your aid. It is great joy to see you; the\r\none desire of my life is satisfied.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “The poor Liu Pei you see here has long desired to\r\ntake refuge with you, but fate has hitherto denied him that privilege.\r\nNow, attacked by Tsʻao Tsʻao, my family lost, I remembered that you,\r\nGeneral, would receive gentlemen from all sides. Wherefore I put my\r\npride in my pocket. I trust that I may be found worthy and one day I\r\nwill prove my gratitude.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao received him with much pleasure and treated him exceedingly\r\nwell. And they both lived in Chʻichou.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Hsiaopʻei, Tsʻao Tsʻao pressed on toward Hsüchou,\r\nwhich, after a short defence and the flight of the defenders, was\r\nsurrendered by Chʻên Têng. Tsʻao Tsʻao led his army into the city,\r\nrestored order and pacified the people. Next he wanted to press on to\r\nHsiapʻi, where Kuan Yü was holding out and keeping guard of Liu Pei’s\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nHsün Yü said, “Kuan Yü is there, in charge of his brother’s family, and\r\nhe will defend the city to the last. If you do not take it quickly Yüan\r\nShao will get it.”\r\n\r\n“I have always loved Kuan Yü, both for his warlike abilities and his\r\nintelligence. I would engage him to enter my service. I would rather\r\nsend some one to talk him into surrender.”\r\n\r\n“He will not do that,” said Kuo Chia; “his sense of right is too solid.\r\nI fear any one who went to speak with him would suffer.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a man stepped out, saying, “I know him slightly and I\r\nwill go.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Chang Liao. Hsün Yü looked at him and said, “Though you\r\nare an old acquaintance I do not think you are equal to talking over\r\nKuan Yü. But I have a scheme that will so entangle him that he will\r\nhave no alternative; he will have to enter the service of the\r\nMinister.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    They set the fatal spring beside the lordly tiger’s trail,\r\n    They hide the hook with fragrant bait to catch the mighty whale.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Kuan Yü was to be entrapped will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nFROM TʻUSHAN CAMP KUAN YÜ MAKES THREE CONDITIONS:\r\nTHE RESCUE AT PAIMA RELEASES TSʻAO TSʻAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan to seduce Kuan Yü from allegiance to his brothers was now\r\nannounced by its proposer. Since Kuan was far braver than ordinary men\r\nhe could only be overreached by superior cunning. So it was proposed to\r\nsend some of his soldiers who had lately been of Liu Pei’s army into\r\nHsiapʻi, where they would say they had come back. They would thus be\r\nallies on the inside. Then an attack and a feigned defeat would entice\r\nKuan to a distance from the city. And his return road would be cut.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao accepted the scheme and a few score of the men who had\r\nlately been in Hsüchou were sent to the city. The commander believed\r\nthe story they told and trusted them. So they were suffered to remain.\r\n\r\nAfter this part of the game had been played, Hsiahou Tun led forward\r\nfive companies against the city. At first Kuan Yü would not accept the\r\nchallenge, but provoked by men sent to hurl insults at him from the\r\nfoot of the wall, his wrath got the better of him and he moved out with\r\nthree companies. After the leaders had exchanged a half score bouts Tun\r\nmade to run away. Kuan Yü pursued. Tun stopped and made a stand; then\r\nhe fled again. Thus alternately fighting and retiring, he enticed Kuan\r\nYü twenty li from the city. Then Kuan suddenly remembering the risk to\r\nthe city drew off his men to return homeward.\r\n\r\nSoon, at the sound of a signal bomb, out moved two bodies of men who\r\nbarred his way. Kuan Yü hastened along a road that seemed to offer\r\nretreat, but from both sides his ambushed enemies shot their crossbows\r\nand the arrows flew like locusts on the wing. No way past was found and\r\nhe turned back. Then both bodies joined in attacking him. He drove them\r\noff and got into the road to his own city, but soon Hsiahou Tun came up\r\nagain and attacked fiercely as before. Evening came and still Kuan was\r\nhemmed in, so he went up on a low hill upon which he encamped for a\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded on all sides by enemies. By and by, looking toward\r\nhis city, he saw the glow of fire. It meant that the traitors, who had\r\ncome in to surrender, had opened the gate and the enemy had gone in in\r\nforce. They had made the fires in order to perplex and distress Kuan Yü\r\nand indeed the sight saddened him.\r\n\r\nIn the night he made efforts to escape from the hill, but every attempt\r\nwas checked by flights of arrows. At daybreak he prepared for one more\r\neffort, but before moving he saw a horseman riding up at full speed and\r\npresently discerned Chang Liao. When within speaking distance, Kuan Yü\r\nsaid, “Are you come to fight me, Wên-yüan?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Chang Liao. “I am come to see you because of our old\r\nfriendship.”\r\n\r\nWherefore he threw aside his sword, dismounted and came forward\r\nsaluting. And the two sat down.\r\n\r\n“Then naturally you have come to talk me over,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“Not so;” said Chang Liao. “Sometime ago you saved me; can I help\r\nsaving you?”\r\n\r\n“Then you desire to help me.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly that,” replied Chang.\r\n\r\n“Then what are you doing here if you have not come to help me?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is known of the fate of your elder brother, nor whether your\r\nyounger brother is alive or dead. Last night your city fell into the\r\nhands of Tsʻao Tsʻao, but neither soldiers nor people were harmed and a\r\nspecial guard was set over the family of Yüan-tê lest they should be\r\nalarmed. I came to tell you how well they had been treated.”\r\n\r\n“This is certainly talking me over,” said Kuan testily. “Though escape\r\nis impossible yet I am not perturbed. I look upon death as going home.\r\nYou had better depart quickly and let me go down and begin the struggle\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Surely you must know everybody will ridicule you when they hear of\r\nthis,” said Chang, laughing loud.\r\n\r\n“I shall die for loyalty and righteousness. Who will laugh?” said Kuan.\r\n\r\n“You would be guilty of three faults if you died.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me them,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\n“First of all you and your elder brother pledged yourselves in the\r\nPeach Garden to die or to live together. Now your brother has been\r\ndefeated and you want to fight to the death. Therefore, if your brother\r\nappear again by and by and wants your help, he will seek it in vain. Is\r\nthis anything else than betraying the Peach Garden oath? Secondly you\r\nare in charge of your brother’s family and, if you fought and died, the\r\ntwo women would be left forlorn and without a protector. That would be\r\na betrayal of trust. Thirdly your military skill stands out conspicuous\r\nand will go down in history. If you do not aid your brother in his\r\nnoble attempt to maintain the Dynasty then all your labours and\r\nsufferings will have been spent to win a worthless reputation as a\r\nvaliant fool. Where is the sense in that? I feel it my duty to point\r\nout these three faults to you.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü remained silent and thought for some time. Then he said, “You\r\nhave spoken of my three faults. What do you desire?”\r\n\r\n“You are surrounded with the certainty of death if you do not yield.\r\nThere is no advantage in a useless death. Wherefore your best course is\r\nto yield to Tsʻao Tsʻao till you hear news of Liu Pei and can rejoin\r\nhim. Thus you will ensure the safety of the two ladies and also keep\r\ninviolate the Peach Garden compact. You will preserve a useful life.\r\nBrother, you must reflect on these things.”\r\n\r\n“Brother, you have spoken of three advantages; now I have three\r\nconditions. If the Minister concede these then will I doff my armour.\r\nIf he refuse, then I prefer to be guilty of the three faults and die.”\r\n\r\n“Why should the Minister not concede them? He is most liberal and large\r\nminded. I pray you to let me hear your conditions.”\r\n\r\n“The first is that as I and the Imperial Uncle have sworn to support\r\nthe Hans I now submit to the Emperor and not to his minister Tsʻao. The\r\nsecond condition is that suitable provision be made for the two ladies\r\nunder my care and that no one shall be allowed to approach them. The\r\nthird is that I shall be allowed to set off to rejoin Uncle Liu so soon\r\nas I shall hear where he is, whether it be far or near. I require all\r\nthese to be satisfied; failing a single one, I will not submit.\r\nWherefore, Wên-yüan, I pray you hasten back and announce them.”\r\n\r\nChang Liao lost no time but rode back to Tsʻao Tsʻao. When he spoke of\r\nKuan Yü’s intention to submit to the Hans but not to Tsʻao Tsʻao, the\r\nlatter smiled, saying, “As I am the Minister of Han, so am I Han. I\r\ngrant that.”\r\n\r\nChang then spoke of provision due to their rank and security from\r\nmolestation for the ladies, to which Tsʻao replied, “I will give them\r\ntwice the regular amount for an Uncle of the Emperor; as for securing\r\nthem from molestation, that is simple. The ordinary domestic law is\r\nenough. Why should there be any doubt?”\r\n\r\nThen said Chang, “Whenever he shall get news of the whereabouts of\r\nYüan-tê, he must go to him.”\r\n\r\nAt this Tsʻao shook his head, saying, “Then I am merely to feed\r\nYün-chʻang. What is the use of this? I cannot consent.”\r\n\r\nChang replied, “You must know of the difference in Yü Jang’s behaviour\r\nbrought about by difference of treatment? Yüan-tê treats Yün-chʻang\r\njust kindly and liberally; you can surely engage his heart and support\r\nby being kinder and more liberal.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is much to the point. I will grant the three conditions,”\r\nsaid Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Chang Liao left to carry the news to Kuan Yü, still on the\r\nsummit of the hill.\r\n\r\n“Now I expect the army to withdraw so that I may enter the city to tell\r\nthe two ladies what has been arranged. After that I submit at once.”\r\n\r\nChang Liao rode back once more with this request and the order was\r\ngiven for the army to retire ten li.\r\n\r\n“Do not do this,” said Hsün Yü. “I fear treachery.”\r\n\r\n“He will certainly not break faith,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. “He is too high\r\nprincipled.”\r\n\r\nThe army retired and Kuan Yü with his force re-entered the city, where\r\nhe saw that the people were following their ordinary avocations in\r\ntranquillity. He came to the palace and went in to see the two ladies,\r\nwho hastened to meet him. He bowed to them below the steps and said, “I\r\napologise for having caused you to feel alarmed.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the Uncle?” asked they.\r\n\r\n“I know not whither he has gone.”\r\n\r\n“What do you intend to do, brother-in-law?”\r\n\r\n“I went out of the city to try a last battle. I was surrounded on a\r\nhill top and Chang Liao has urged me to yield. I proposed three\r\nconditions, all of which were conceded, and the enemy drew off to allow\r\nme to return to the city. Unless I have your decision, sisters-in-law,\r\nI scarcely dare to take any final step.”\r\n\r\nThey asked what were the conditions and were told. Then Kan Fu-jên\r\nsaid, “When Tsʻao’s army came in we took it to mean certain death. But\r\nit is scarcely credible that not a hair of our heads has been\r\ndisturbed, not a soldier has dared enter our doors. You have accepted\r\nthe conditions, brother-in-law, and there is no need to ask our\r\nconsent. Our only fear is that he will not let you go by and by to\r\nsearch for the Uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Sisters-in-law, you need not be anxious. I will see to that.”\r\n\r\n“You must decide everything and need not ask us women-kind.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü withdrew and then, with a small escort, went to his interview\r\nwith Tsʻao Tsʻao. Tsʻao came to the outermost gate to welcome him and\r\nKuan Yü dismounted and made obeisance. Tsʻao returned his salute with\r\nthe greatest cordiality.\r\n\r\n“The leader of a defeated army is grateful for the graciousness that\r\nhas preserved his life,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“I have so long admired your loyalty and high principles that this\r\nhappy meeting gratifies the desire of my whole life,” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“As the Minister has granted the three requests which my friend\r\npetitioned for on my behalf there is now but little to discuss,” said\r\nKuan.\r\n\r\n“As I have spoken, so be it; I could not break faith,” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Whenever I hear where Uncle Liu is I must certainly go to him, even if\r\nthrough fire and water. It may be that there there will be no\r\nopportunity of taking leave. I trust you will understand the reason.”\r\n\r\n“If Liu Pei should prove to be alive you must certainly be allowed to\r\ngo to him. But I fear that in the confusion he may have lost his life.\r\nYou may set your mind at rest and let me make enquiries.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü thanked him. Then a banquet was prepared in his honour. Next\r\nday the army started on its homeward march.\r\n\r\nFor the journey to the capital a carriage was prepared for the two\r\nladies and Kuan Yü was its guard. On the road they rested at a certain\r\npost station and Tsʻao Tsʻao, anxious to compromise Kuan by beguiling\r\nhim into forgetfulness of his duty, assigned him to the same apartment\r\nas his sisters-in-law. Kuan stood the whole night before the door with\r\na lighted candle in his hand. Not once did he yield to fatigue. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s respect for him could not but increase.\r\n\r\nAt the capital the Minister assigned a dignified residence to Kuan Yü,\r\nwhich he immediately divided into two enclosures, the inner one for the\r\ntwo ladies and the other for himself. He placed a guard of eighteen of\r\nhis veterans over the women’s quarters.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was presented to the Emperor Hsien who conferred upon him the\r\nrank of General. Soon after Tsʻao made a great banquet, inviting all\r\nhis advisers and fighting men, solely in honour of Kuan Yü, who sat in\r\nthe seat of honour. Beside this he received presents of silks and gold\r\nand silver vessels, all of which were sent into the ladies’ quarters\r\nfor their use and keeping. In fact from the day of arrival in the\r\ncapital Kuan Yü was treated with marked respect and distinction,\r\nbanquets and feasts following each other in quick succession.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao also presented him with ten most lovely serving girls;\r\nthese also were sent within to wait upon his two sisters-in-law.\r\n\r\nEvery third day Kuan Yü went to the door of the women’s quarters to\r\nenquire after their welfare, and then they asked if any news of the\r\nwanderer had come. This ceremony closed with the words “Brother-in-law,\r\nyou may retire when you wish.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao heard of this extremely correct behaviour and thought all the\r\nmore of the man for it.\r\n\r\nOne day Tsʻao noticed that the robe Kuan Yü was wearing was old and\r\nfrayed. Taking his measurements Tsʻao had a new one made of fine\r\nbrocade and presented it to him. He took it and put it on under the old\r\nrobe, so that the latter covered it.\r\n\r\n“Why so very thrifty?” laughed Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“It is not thrift,” was his reply. “The old robe was a gift from my\r\nbrother and I wear it because it reminds me of him. I could not allow\r\nthe new gift to eclipse his old one.”\r\n\r\n“How very high principled!” said Tsʻao Tsʻao sighing.\r\n\r\nBut he was not pleased with the man for all that he praised his\r\nconduct. One day when Kuan Yü was at home there came a messenger to say\r\nthat the two women had thrown themselves on the ground and were\r\nweeping. They would not say why. Kuan Yü set his dress in order, went\r\nover and knelt by the door saying, “Why this grief, sisters-in-law?”\r\n\r\nKan Fu-jên replied, “In the night I dreamed that the Uncle had fallen\r\ninto a pit. I woke up and told Mi Fu-jên and we think he must be dead.\r\nSo we weep.”\r\n\r\n“Dreams are not to be credited,” he replied. “You dreamed of him\r\nbecause you were thinking of him. Pray do not grieve.”\r\n\r\nJust then Kuan Yü was invited to another banquet so he took leave of\r\nthe ladies and went. Seeing Kuan looked sad and tearful his host asked\r\nthe reason.\r\n\r\n“My sisters-in-law have been weeping for my brother and I cannot help\r\nbeing sad in sympathy.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao smiled and tried to cheer up his guest. He plied him with wine so\r\nthat he became quite intoxicated and sat stroking his beard and saying,\r\n“What a useless thing am I! I could do no service for my country and I\r\nhave parted from my elder brother.”\r\n\r\n“How many hairs in your beard?” suddenly asked his host.\r\n\r\n“Some hundreds, perhaps. In the autumn a few fall out, but in the\r\nwinter it is fullest. Then I use a black silk bag to keep the hairs\r\nfrom being broken,” replied Kuan.\r\n\r\nTsʻao had a bag made for him to protect his beard. Soon after when they\r\nwere at Court the Emperor asked what was the bag he saw on Kuan Yü’s\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“My beard is rather long, Your Majesty,” said Kuan. “So the Minister\r\ngave me a bag to protect it.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor bade him take off the bag and show his beard in all its\r\nfullness and it fell in rippling waves below his breast.\r\n\r\n“Really a most beautiful beard!” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThis is why people call him “The Duke with the Beautiful Beard.”\r\n\r\nAnother time, after a banquet, Tsʻao was seeing his guest start from\r\nthe gate of his palace when he noticed that his charger was very thin.\r\n\r\n“Why is he so thin?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“My worthless body is rather heavy and really too much for him. He is\r\nalways out of condition.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao at once told his men to bring out a certain steed and before long\r\nhe appeared. He was red, like glowing charcoal, and a handsome creature\r\nin every way.\r\n\r\n“Do you recognise him?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is no other than ‘Red Hare!’” cried Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is he,” said Tsʻao, and he presented the horse, all fully\r\ncaparisoned, to his guest. Kuan Yü bowed many times and thanked him\r\nagain and again, till Tsʻao began to feel displeased and said, “I have\r\ngiven you many things, lovely handmaids and gold and silks and never\r\nwon a bow of gratitude from you before. This horse seems to please you\r\nbetter than all the rest. Why do you think so poorly of the damsels and\r\nso much of the steed?”\r\n\r\n“I know the horse, and his speed, and I am very lucky to get him. Now\r\nas soon as I find out where my brother is I can get to him in a single\r\nday,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\nTsʻao grumbled to himself and began to repent of his gift, but Kuan Yü\r\ntook his leave and went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fortune dealt a stunning blow, still he played his part;\r\n    Partitioning his dwelling proved his purity of heart.\r\n    The crafty Minister desired to win him to his side,\r\n    But felt that failure was foredoomed however much he tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao Tsʻao to Chang Liao, “I have treated him pretty liberally,\r\nbut he still cherishes the desire to leave me. Do you know if it is\r\nreally so?”\r\n\r\n“I will try to find out,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo he took an early opportunity of seeing Kuan Yü and when the\r\npolitenesses of the visit were over, Liao said, “I recommended you to\r\nthe Minister and you have not lost much by that.”\r\n\r\n“I am deeply affected by his kindness and bounty,” said Kuan Yü, “but,\r\nthough my body is here, yet I am always thinking of my brother.”\r\n\r\n“Your words do not express present conditions quite correctly. One who\r\nlives in the world without discrimination and consideration of his\r\nrelations with others is not the most admirable type of man. Even\r\nYüan-tê never treated you better than does the Minister. Why then do\r\nyou maintain this desire to get away?”\r\n\r\n“I know only too well that he has been most kind, but I have also\r\nreceived great kindness from Uncle Liu. Beside we have sworn to die\r\ntogether and I cannot remain here, but before I go I must try to render\r\nhim some signal service to prove my gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing Yüan-tê should have left the world, whither will you go?”\r\nsaid Chang.\r\n\r\n“I will follow him to the realms below.”\r\n\r\nThere could no longer be the least doubt as to Kuan Yü’s intentions and\r\nChang Liao told Tsʻao Tsʻao just how matters stood. Tsʻao sighed. “To\r\nserve one’s chief with unswerving fidelity is a proof of the highest\r\nprinciple of all,” said he.\r\n\r\nSaid Hsün Yü, “He spoke of performing some act of service before\r\nleaving. If he gets no chance of such a thing, he will not be able to\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao agreed that this was so.\r\n\r\nThe story of Yüan-tê broke off at the point when he went to Yüan Shao\r\nfor refuge. Here he was always sorrowful and, when asked the reason,\r\nsaid he did not know where his brothers were nor what had happened to\r\nhis family since they fell into the hands of Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Why should I not be sad when I have failed towards my country and my\r\nfamily?” said he.\r\n\r\n“I have long wished to attack Hsütu,” said Yüan Shao. “Now it is autumn\r\nand just the time for an expedition, so let us discuss plans for the\r\ndestruction of Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nTʻien Fêng at once opposed this. “When Tsʻao Tsʻao attacked Hsüchou and\r\nHsütu was undefended you let the chance slip by. Now that Hsüchou has\r\nbeen captured and the soldiers are flushed with victory it would be\r\nmadness to attempt it. It is necessary to await another chance.”\r\n\r\n“Let me think about it,” said Yüan Shao.\r\n\r\nHe asked advice from Yüan-tê, whether to attack or to hold on.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “Tsʻao is a rebel. I think you are failing in your\r\nduty if you do not attack him.”\r\n\r\n“Your words are good,” said Shao.\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind to move. But again the adviser Tʻien intervened.\r\nThen Shao grew angry, saying, “You fellows who cultivate literature and\r\ndespise war have made me miss a lot.”\r\n\r\nTʻien Fêng bowed his head and said, “Neglect your servant’s wise words\r\nand you will fail in the field.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao was so angry that he wanted to put him to death. However\r\nYüan-tê begged him off and he was only imprisoned.\r\n\r\nSeeing the fate of his colleague another adviser, Chu Shou by name,\r\nassembled his clan and distributed among them all his possessions,\r\nsaying, “I go with the army. If we succeed, then nothing can exceed our\r\nglory, but if we are defeated, the risk I run is great.”\r\n\r\nHis friends wept as they said farewell.\r\n\r\nYen Liang was appointed to the command of the advance guard, to go to\r\nattack Paima. Then Chu Shou first protested, “His mind is too narrow\r\nfor such a post. He is brave but unequal to such a trust.”\r\n\r\n“You are not the sort of man to measure my best generals,” replied\r\nShao.\r\n\r\nThe army marched to Liyang and the Prefect sent an urgent call to\r\nHsüchʻang for aid. Tsʻao moved his armies hastily. As soon as the news\r\nof battle got about Kuan Yü went to see the Minister and asked that he\r\nmight go with the first body.\r\n\r\n“I scarcely dare put you to such inconvenience, but presently, if need\r\narises, I will call upon you.”\r\n\r\nSo Kuan Yü retired and fifteen legions marched out in three directions.\r\nOn the road the letters from Liu Yen arrived praying for help and the\r\nfirst five legions went to Paima and took up a position supported by\r\nthe hills. In the wide plains in front of them Yen Liang was encamped\r\nwith ten legions of veterans.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was frightened at the force opposed to him and, returning\r\nto camp, spoke to Sung Hsien, who had once served under Lü Pu, saying,\r\n“You are one of Lü Pu’s famous veteran generals; can you give battle to\r\nthis Yen?”\r\n\r\nSung Hsien agreed to try. He armed himself, mounted and rode to the\r\nfront. Yen Liang was there on horseback his sword lying crossways.\r\nSeeing an opponent approaching he uttered a loud shout and galloped\r\ntoward him. The two met, but after only three bouts, Sung Hsien fell\r\nunder a mighty slash from the other’s sword.\r\n\r\n“What a terrible leader!” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“He has slain my comrade, I want to go and avenge him,” then cried Wei\r\nHsü.\r\n\r\nTsʻao bade him go and he rode out, spear in rest, and in front of the\r\narmy railed at Yen Liang.\r\n\r\nYen Liang replied not a word, but their two steeds came together and at\r\nthe first blow from Yen’s sword this second champion fell.\r\n\r\n“Now, who again dares face him?” cried Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHsü Huang took up the challenge and he went out. The combat endured a\r\nscore of bouts and then Hsü fled back to his own side. The other\r\ncaptains were now greatly depressed at their failure. Yen Liang however\r\nhad marched off his men leaving Tsʻao very sad at the loss of two\r\ncaptains in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThen Chʻêng Yü went to see him saying, “I can produce a man the equal\r\nof Yen Liang.”\r\n\r\n“Who?” cried Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“No other than Kuan Yü.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid that if he is given an opportunity to perform that return\r\nservice he spoke of he will leave me.”\r\n\r\n“If Liu Pei is still alive he is with Yüan Shao. If you get Kuan Yü to\r\ndefeat Yüan Shao’s army Shao will look askance at Liu Pei and put him\r\nto death. Liu Pei gone, where can Kuan Yü go?”\r\n\r\nThis argument appealed to Tsʻao Tsʻao at once and he sent to request\r\nKuan Yü to come.\r\n\r\nPrevious to obeying the call Kuan went to say farewell to his\r\nsisters-in-law.\r\n\r\n“You may get news of the Uncle on the journey,” said they.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Kuan and left them.\r\n\r\nArmed with his famous Black Dragon, riding on the swift steed “Red\r\nHare,” and having but a slender following, Kuan Yü was not long in\r\narriving at Paima. He saw Tsʻao Tsʻao, who told him what had happened.\r\nYen Liang was too valiant for any to face.\r\n\r\n“Let me look at him,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\nThen wine was served for his refreshment and while they were drinking,\r\nit was reported that Yen Liang once again offered a challenge. So Tsʻao\r\nand his guest and staff went to the summit of a hill whence the enemy\r\ncould be seen. These two sat on the hill top and the captains stood\r\nabout them. Tsʻao pointed out Yen Liang’s men arrayed on the plains\r\nbelow. The ensigns and banners waving fresh and bright amid the forest\r\nof spears and swords made a grand and imposing spectacle.\r\n\r\n“See what fine fellows these northmen are,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“I regard them as so many clay fowls and mud dogs,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao pointed out Yen Liang, saying, “There he is under that\r\numbrella.”\r\n\r\nHe was wearing an embroidered robe and a silver breastplate and rode on\r\nhorseback. His hand gripped his sword.\r\n\r\n“His head looks as though it was stuck on a pole for sale,” said Kuan,\r\njust glancing over the army at his feet.\r\n\r\n“You must not despise him,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nKuan rose, saying, “I am a poor thing but I will go over and bring you\r\nhis head if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Joking is not allowed in this army,” interposed Chang Liao. “Be\r\ncareful what you say.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü quickly mounted, turned down his mighty weapon and galloped\r\ndown the hill, his phoenix eyes rounded and his heavy eyebrows fiercely\r\nbristling. He dashed straight into the enemy’s array and the northmen\r\nopened like water before him, a wave spreading right and left. He made\r\ndirectly for the general.\r\n\r\nNow Yen Liang sitting there in state saw a horseman rushing toward him\r\nand just as he began to ask who the rider of the red horse was, lo! the\r\nhorseman was there. Taken utterly by surprise the leader could make no\r\ndefence. Kuan’s arm rose and the mighty weapon fell. And with it fell\r\nYen Liang.\r\n\r\nLeaping from the saddle Kuan Yü cut off his victim’s head and hung it\r\nto his horse’s neck. Then he mounted and rode out, just as if there was\r\nno army there.\r\n\r\nThe northern men, panic stricken, made no fight. Tsʻao’s army attacked\r\nwith vigour and slew great numbers of them. They captured many horses\r\nand weapons and much military gear. Kuan Yü rode quickly back up the\r\nhill and laid the proof of his prowess at the feet of the Minister.\r\n\r\n“You are more than human, General!” cried Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“What have I done to talk about?” said Kuan. “My brother, Chang I-tê,\r\ndid the same thing in an army of a hundred legions, and did it easily.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao marvelled at the statement and turning to those about him\r\nsaid, “If you meet this brother be careful.” And he bade them make a\r\nnote on the overlap of their robes so that they should remember.\r\n\r\nThe beaten army returning northward met Yüan Shao on the road and told\r\ntheir story. “A red-faced warrior with a long beard, wielding a huge\r\nsword, broke into the army, cut off the general’s head and bore it\r\noff,” said they.\r\n\r\n“Who was this?” asked Shao.\r\n\r\nChu Shou said, “It must have been Liu Yüan-tê’s brother; it could be\r\nnobody else.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao was very angry and, pointing to Liu Pei, he said, “Your\r\nbrother has slain my beloved leader. You are in the plot too. Why\r\nshould I save you alive?”\r\n\r\nHe bade the lictors take him away and behead him.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Morning saw him guest on high,\r\n        Evening, prisoner, doomed to die.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis actual fate will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nYÜAN SHAO IS DEFEATED AND LOSES A LEADER:\r\nKUAN YÜ ABANDONS RANK AND WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the last chapter closed Yüan-tê had been condemned to die. He spoke\r\nup, however, and said, “Pray hear one word, Illustrious Sir, before you\r\ndecide. I have lost sight of my brother since my misfortune at Hsüchou\r\nand know not whether Yün-chʻang be dead or alive. There are many men in\r\nthe world who resemble him. Is every red-faced man with a beard named\r\nKuan? Should you not rather seek some evidence?”\r\n\r\nNow Yüan Shao was impulsive and facile by nature and when Yüan-tê spoke\r\nthus, he suddenly turned upon Chu Shou, saying, “By wrongly regarding\r\nwhat you said I nearly killed an innocent man.”\r\n\r\nThen he requested Yüan-tê once more to resume his seat in the tent and\r\nadvise him how to avenge Yen Liang.\r\n\r\nSoon from the lower end a voice was heard, saying, “Yen Liang and I\r\nwere as brothers and can I allow any other to avenge his death?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a man of middle height with a face like a unicorn, a\r\nfamous leader from Hopei, named Wên Chʻou.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao was pleased and said, “You are the only man who can do it. I\r\nwill give you ten legions and you can cross the Yellow River, and\r\nquickly smite that rebel Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot do it; he will fail,” said Chu Shou. “The proper course is\r\nto hold Yenching and detach a force to Kuantu. If you rashly cross the\r\nriver and anything goes wrong not a soul will return.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao said, “That is always the way with you fellows, always\r\ndelaying and taking the dash out of the soldiers. You put off to-day\r\nand postpone to-morrow till success has become impossible. Do you\r\nforget that promptitude is what the soldier honours?”\r\n\r\nThe adviser withdrew sadly, saying, “Superiors do not curb their\r\nambitions: inferiors must strive to render service. Eternal is the\r\nYellow River, shall I cross it?”\r\n\r\nThereafter he feigned illness and went no more to the Council.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “I have received much kindness at your hands and have\r\nbeen unable to show my gratitude. I would accompany General Wên that I\r\nmay repay your bounty and also that I may hear news of my brother.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao gladly consented and ordered Wên Chʻou to share his command\r\nwith Yüan-tê. But the former objected saying that Yüan-tê had been so\r\noften defeated that it would augur ill for success this time. He\r\nproposed to give Yüan-tê command of the rear guard, and this being\r\napproved, three legions were told off under Liu Pei’s special command\r\nto follow the main body.\r\n\r\nThe prowess displayed by Kuan Yü in the bold attack on Yen Liang\r\nredoubled Tsʻao Tsʻao’s respect for him and he memorialised the throne\r\nthat Kuan Yü receive the title of Marquis of Hanshoutʻing and a seal\r\nwas cast for him.\r\n\r\nJust then came the unexpected news that Yüan Shao’s army had moved\r\ntoward the Yellow River and was in position above Yenching. Tsʻao first\r\nsent to transfer the inhabitants to Hsiho and then led out an army to\r\noppose Yüan Shao. He issued an order to face about, thus placing the\r\nrear companies in front. The commissariat wagons were also placed in\r\nthe van.\r\n\r\n“What is this reversal for?” asked Lü Chʻien.\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “When the supplies are in rear they are liable to be\r\nplundered. So I have put them first.”\r\n\r\n“But if you meet the enemy and they steal them?”\r\n\r\n“Wait till the enemy appears; I shall know what to do.”\r\n\r\nLü Chʻien was much exercised at this new move of the Minister’s. In the\r\nmeantime the supply train moved along the river toward Yenching.\r\nPresently the foremost troops raised a great shout and Tsʻao sent to\r\nsee what it meant. The messenger came back to say Wên Chʻou’s army was\r\napproaching, and the supply train had been abandoned and was at the\r\nmercy of the enemy. Thereupon Tsʻao pointed to two mounds saying, “We\r\nwill take refuge here for the present.”\r\n\r\nAll those near him hastened to the mounds. There Tsʻao ordered them all\r\nto loosen their dress, lay aside their breastplates and rest a time.\r\nThe horsemen turned their steeds loose.\r\n\r\nWên Chʻou’s men approached under cover. As they drew near one after\r\nanother the officers told Tsʻao saying, “The rebels are near: we ought\r\nto catch the horses and go back to Paima.”\r\n\r\nBut the adviser, Hsün Yu, checked them saying, “These are a bait for\r\nthe enemy: why retire?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao glanced across at him and said, “He understands; do not say\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nNow having got possession of the supply carts the enemy next came to\r\nseize the horses. By this time they had all broken ranks and were\r\nscattered, each man going his own way. Then suddenly Tsʻao gave the\r\norder to go down from the mounds and smite them.\r\n\r\nThe surprise was complete. Wên Chʻou’s army was in confusion and\r\nTsʻao’s men surrounded them. Wên Chʻou made a stand, but those about\r\nhim trampled each other down and he could do nothing but flee. And he\r\nfled.\r\n\r\nThen standing on the top of a mound Tsʻao pointed to the flying leader\r\ncalling out, “There is one of the most famous captains of the north;\r\nwho can capture him?”\r\n\r\nChang Liao and Hsü Huang both mounted and dashed after him, crying,\r\n“Wên Chʻou, do not run away!”\r\n\r\nLooking round, the fugitive saw two pursuers and then he set aside his\r\nspear, took his bow and adjusted an arrow, which he shot at Chang Liao.\r\n\r\n“Cease shooting, you rebel!” shouted Hsü Huang. Chang Liao ducked his\r\nhead and the shaft went harmlessly by, save that it carried away the\r\ntassel of his cap. He only pressed harder in pursuit. The next arrow\r\nhowever struck his horse in the head and the animal stumbled and fell,\r\nthrowing his rider to the earth.\r\n\r\nThen Wên Chʻou turned to come back. Hsü Huang, whirling his battle axe,\r\nstood in his way to stop him. But he saw behind Wên several more\r\nhorsemen coming to help him and as they would have been too many for\r\nhim he fled. Wên pursued along the river bank. Suddenly he saw coming\r\ntoward him with banners fluttering in the breeze, a small party of\r\nhorse, and the leader carried a great sword.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Yün-chʻang, for it was he, and he attacked at once. At\r\nthe third bout Wên Chʻou’s heart failed him and he wheeled and fled,\r\nfollowing the windings of the river. But Kuan Yü’s steed was fast and\r\nsoon caught up. One blow, and the hapless Wên Chʻou fell.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao saw from the mound that the leader of the enemy had\r\nfallen, he gave the signal for a general onset and many of the northmen\r\nwere driven into the river. And the carts with supplies and all the\r\nhorses were quickly recovered.\r\n\r\nNow Kuan Yü, at the head of a few horsemen, was thrusting here and\r\nstriking there at the moment when Yüan-tê, with the three reserve\r\nlegions, appeared on the battle field. At once they told him that the\r\nred-faced, long-bearded warrior was there and had slain Wên Chʻou. He\r\nhastily pressed forward to try to get a look at the warrior. He saw\r\nacross the river a large body of horse and the banners bore the words\r\n“Kuan Yün-chʻang, Marquis of Hanshoutʻing.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is my brother and he is really with Tsʻao Tsʻao,” said\r\nYüan-tê, secretly thanking God that he was safe.\r\n\r\nHe made an attempt to wait about till he could call to Kuan Yü, but a\r\ngreat mass of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s soldiers came rushing down and he was\r\nforced to retire.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao, bringing reinforcements, reached Kuantu and built a\r\nstockade. Two advisers went in to see him and said, “Again that fellow\r\nKuan has been in the battle; he killed Wên Chʻou. Liu Pei pretends\r\nignorance of him.”\r\n\r\nTheir master was angry and railed at Pei. “The long-eared rebel! How\r\ndare he do such a thing?”\r\n\r\nSoon Yüan-tê appeared; again Shao ordered him out to instant execution.\r\n\r\n“What crime have I committed?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“You sent your brother to slay one of my generals. Is that no crime?”\r\n\r\n“Pray let me explain before I die. Tsʻao hated me and has always done\r\nso. Now he has found out where I am and, fearing that I may help you,\r\nhas got my brother to destroy your two generals, feeling sure that when\r\nyou heard of it you would be angry and put me to death. You cannot fail\r\nto see this.”\r\n\r\n“What he says is sense,” said Shao, “and you two nearly brought on me\r\nthe reproach of injuring the good.”\r\n\r\nHe ordered his attendants to retire and asked Yüan-tê to come and sit\r\nby him. Yüan-tê came saying, “I am deeply thankful, Illustrious Sir,\r\nfor your great kindness, for which I can never be sufficiently\r\ngrateful. Now I desire to send some confidential messenger with a\r\nsecret letter to my brother to tell him where I am, and I am sure he\r\nwill come without a moment’s delay. He will help you to destroy Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao to make up for having destroyed your two officers. Do you approve\r\nof this?”\r\n\r\n“If I got Yün-chʻang he would be ten times better than the two men I\r\nhave lost,” replied Shao.\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê prepared a letter. But there was no one to take it. Yüan\r\nShao ordered the army to withdraw to Wu-yang, where they made a large\r\ncamp. For some time nothing was done.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao sent Hsiahou Tun to defend the strategical point at\r\nKuantu while he led the bulk of the army back to the capital. There he\r\ngave many banquets in honour of the services of Kuan Yü and then he\r\ntold Lü Chʻien that putting the supplies in the front of the army had\r\nbeen meant as a bait to draw the enemy to destruction. “Only Hsün Yu\r\nunderstood that,” said he in conclusion.\r\n\r\nEvery one present praised his ingenuity. Even while the banquet was\r\nproceeding there arrived news of a rising of Yellow Turban rebels at\r\nJunan. They were very strong and Tsʻao Hung had been defeated in\r\nseveral engagements. Now he begged for help.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü, hearing this said, “I should like to have the opportunity of\r\nperforming some service by destroying these rebels.”\r\n\r\n“You have already rendered noble services for which you have not been\r\nproperly requited. I could hardly trouble you again,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“I have been idle too long; I shall get ill,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nTsʻao encouraged him to go and gave him five legions with Yü Chin and\r\nYo Chin as captains under him. They were to leave soon.\r\n\r\nThen Hsün Yü said privily to his master, “He always cherishes the idea\r\nof returning to Liu Pei. He will leave you if he hears any news. Do not\r\nlet him go on this expedition.”\r\n\r\n“If he does well this time I will not let him go into battle again,”\r\nsaid Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nIn due time the force led by Kuan Yü drew near the rebels and made\r\ntheir camp. One night, just outside his camp, two spies were caught and\r\ntaken in to Kuan who in one of them recognised Sun Chʻien. The\r\nattendants being dismissed Kuan Yü questioned him.\r\n\r\n“After we lost sight of each other I have heard not a word of you; what\r\nare you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“After I escaped I drifted hither and thither till I had the good\r\nfortune to reach Junan and Liu Pʻi took me in. But why are you with\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao, General? And where are your sisters-in-law? Are they\r\nwell?”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü told him all that had happened.\r\n\r\n“I have heard lately that Liu Pei is with Yüan Shao. I would have liked\r\nto go and join him, but I have not found a convenient opportunity. Now\r\nthe two men I am with have taken the side of Yüan Shao against Tsʻao.\r\nBy good luck you were coming here so I got command of a small party of\r\nscouts to be able to see you and tell you. Presently our two leaders\r\nwill pretend to be defeated and you, and the two ladies, can go over to\r\nYüan Shao. And you will see your brother.”\r\n\r\n“Since he is there I certainly must go at once to see him. But it is a\r\nmisfortune that I have slain two of Yüan Shao’s generals. I fear things\r\nare not in my favour,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\n“Let me go first and see how the land lies; I will come back and tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I would risk a myriad deaths to see my brother,” said Kuan Yü. “But I\r\nmust go to say farewell to Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien was sent away that night and next day Kuan Yü led out his\r\nmen to offer battle. Kung Tu, in armour, went out to the front of the\r\nline of battle and Kuan Yü said, “You people, why have you risen\r\nagainst the government?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you blame us when you have turned your back on your own lord?”\r\nreplied Kung Tu.\r\n\r\n“How have I turned my back on my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Liu Yüan-tê is with Yüan Pên-chʻu and you are with Tsʻao Tsʻao; what\r\nis that?”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü could not reply, but he whirled round his sword and rode\r\nforward. Tu fled and Kuan Yü followed. Tu turned and said to Kuan Yü,\r\n“I cannot forget my old chief’s kindness. Now attack as soon as you can\r\nand I will give up the defences.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü understood and urged on his men. The leaders of the rebels\r\npretended they were worsted and they all scattered. So the city was\r\ntaken. Having pacified the people Kuan Yü quickly led his army back to\r\nthe capital, where he was met by Tsʻao, congratulated on his success\r\nand feasted.\r\n\r\nWhen this was all over Kuan Yü went to the dwelling of his\r\nsisters-in-law to pay his respects at their gate.\r\n\r\n“Have you been able to get any news of Uncle Liu in your two\r\nexpeditions?” asked the Lady Kan.\r\n\r\n“None,” replied Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nAs he retired from the door he heard sounds of bitter weeping within.\r\n\r\n“Alas he is dead,” said they. “Our brother-in-law thinks we shall be\r\ngreatly distressed and hides the truth from us.”\r\n\r\nOne of the old soldiers, who acted as guard, hearing the sounds of\r\nperpetual grief, took pity on them and said, “Do not weep, ladies; your\r\nlord is with Yüan Shao in Hopei.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?” said they.\r\n\r\n“I went out with General Kuan and one of the soldiers told me.”\r\n\r\nThe two ladies summoned Kuan Yü and reproached him saying, “Uncle Liu\r\nnever betrayed you and yet you remain here enjoying the bounty of Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao and forgetting the old times. And you tell us falsehoods.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü bowed his head. “My brother really is in Hopei, but I dared not\r\ntell you, lest it should become known. Something must be done but done\r\ncarefully and it needs time.”\r\n\r\n“Brother-in-law, you should hasten,” said the Lady Kan.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü withdrew feeling that he must evolve some scheme of departure\r\nwithout further loss of time. It caused him much uneasiness.\r\n\r\nYü Chin, having found out that Liu Pei was in the north, told Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, who at once sent Chang Liao to find out Kuan Yü’s intentions.\r\nChang Liao entered jauntily and congratulated Kuan, saying, “They tell\r\nme you obtained news of your brother in the battlefield; I felicitate\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“My lord was there indeed but I met him not. I see nothing to be glad\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any difference between the relationship of you two and that\r\nof any other two brothers?”\r\n\r\nKuan replied, “You and I stand in the relationship of friends: Yüan-tê\r\nand I are friends and brothers beside, and prince and minister in\r\naddition to both. Our relationship cannot be discussed in usual terms.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now that you know where your brother is, are you going to him?”\r\n\r\n“How can I go back on what I said before? I am sure you will explain\r\nfully to the Minister.”\r\n\r\nChang Liao went back and told his master who said, “I must find a way\r\nto keep him here.”\r\n\r\nWhile Kuan Yü was pondering over his difficulties they told him that a\r\nfriend had come to enquire for him. The visitor was introduced but Kuan\r\ndid not recognise him.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Kuan.\r\n\r\n“I am Chʻên Chên of Nanyang, in the service of Yüan Shao.”\r\n\r\nIn great perturbation Kuan Yü sent away the attendants and, they being\r\ngone, said, “There is some special reason for your visit.”\r\n\r\nFor reply the newcomer drew out a letter and handed it to his host, who\r\nrecognised that it was from his brother Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I, the writer, and you, Sir, pledged ourselves in the Peach Garden\r\n    to die together. Why then are we apart and yet alive, our kindly\r\n    feelings destroyed, our sense of right outraged? Surely you desire\r\n    to obtain fame and acquire riches and honour by offering my head as\r\n    a crowning act of merit. More might be said but I await your\r\n    commands with great anxiety.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKuan Yü finished the letter with a bitter cry. “I always wanted to find\r\nmy brother, but I did not know where he was. How can he think such evil\r\nof me?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yüan-tê looks for you very eagerly, and if you are still bound by the\r\nold pledge you should go quickly,” said the messenger.\r\n\r\n“Any one born into the world without the one essential virtue of\r\nsincerity is no true man. I came here openly and can go in no other\r\nway. Now will I write a letter which I will ask you to bear to my\r\nbrother, that as soon as I can take leave of Tsʻao Tsʻao I will bring\r\nthe ladies and come to him.”\r\n\r\n“But what if Tsʻao Tsʻao refuse to let you go?” said Chʻên Chên.\r\n\r\n“Then would I rather die; I will not remain here.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Sir, quickly write your letter and relieve your brother from his\r\nanxiety.”\r\n\r\nSo Kuan Yü wrote like this: “I, the humble one, know full well that a\r\nman of principle does not betray and a man of loyalty despises death. I\r\nhave been a student in my youth and know somewhat of the proprieties. I\r\nsigh and weep at the memory of the fraternal affection that made Yang\r\nChio-ai and Tso Po-tʻao die rather than separate. I was in charge of\r\nHsiapʻi but the place lacked provision and there was no help. I would\r\nhave fought to the death but there was on my shoulders the\r\nresponsibility for my sisters-in-law. Wherefore I had to take care of\r\nmy body lest I betrayed my trust. And so I made a prisoner of myself,\r\nhoping to find a way of release. I heard of you lately in Junan. I\r\nmust, however, bid farewell to Tsʻao Tsʻao and bring the ladies with me\r\nwhen I come. May I perish, victim to the superhuman powers, if I have\r\nharboured any traitorous thought. Pencil and paper are poor substitutes\r\nfor what I would say, but I look to see you soon.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor left with this missive and Kuan Yü went to tell the women.\r\nThen he proceeded to the Minister’s palace to say farewell. But Tsʻao\r\nknew what he was coming for and he found at the gate the board\r\nintimating that no one could be received. So he had to return. However,\r\nhe bade his own few soldiers prepare to start at any moment. He also\r\ngave orders that everything received from Tsʻao was to be left in the\r\nquarters: nothing was to be taken.\r\n\r\nNext day he again proceeded to the palace to say farewell to his\r\npatron, but again found the board hanging there to show there was no\r\nadmission. So it was several times; he could never enter. Then he went\r\nto see Chang Liao, but he was indisposed.\r\n\r\n“This means he will not let me go,” thought Kuan Yü. “But I am going\r\nand I shall hesitate no longer.”\r\n\r\nSo he wrote this letter:—“As a young man I entered the service of the\r\nImperial Uncle, and pledged myself to share his fortunes. Heaven and\r\nEarth witnessed this oath. When I lost the city I made three requests\r\nwhich you granted. Now I hear my brother is with Yüan Shao and I,\r\nremembering our pledge, cannot but go to him. Though your bounty is\r\ngreat I forget not the bond of the past, wherefore I write this letter\r\nof farewell trusting that when you have read it you will be content for\r\nme to postpone to another season the proof of my gratitude.”\r\n\r\nHe sealed and sent it to the Palace. Then he deposited in the treasury\r\nof his dwelling all the gold and silver he had received, suspended his\r\nseal of marquis in the reception hall and left, taking his\r\nsisters-in-law with him in a carriage. He rode “Red Hare” and carried\r\nBlack Dragon in his hand. With a small escort of men, those formerly\r\nunder his command, he left the city by the north gate.\r\n\r\nThe wardens would have stopped him but he frightened them with a fierce\r\nshout. Having got out he told the escort to go in front with the\r\ncarriage while he would remain behind to guard against pursuit. So they\r\npushed the carriage toward the high road.\r\n\r\nIn the city Kuan Yü’s letter reached the Minister while he was\r\nconsulting about what to do. He read it and exclaimed, “So he has\r\nleft!”\r\n\r\nThen the warden of the gate came to report that Kuan Yü had forced his\r\nway out, and was gone with a carriage, a horse and a score of guards.\r\nNext came the servants from his house to report that he had left,\r\ntaking nothing of the treasure, nor any one of the waiting maids.\r\nEverything was left in the house. Even his seal was there. His only\r\nescort were the few men of his original force.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the assembly of men rose a voice saying, “With three\r\ncompanies of mailed horse I will bring him back alive.”\r\n\r\nTheir eyes turned to the speaker, who was General Tsʻai Yang.\r\n\r\n\r\n        On the dragon’s cave he turns his back,\r\n        But numberless wolves infest his track.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat came of this offer to pursue will be seen in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n“BEAUTIFUL BEARD” RIDES ON A SOLITARY JOURNEY:\r\nAND SLAYS SIX MEN AT FIVE PASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow of all the captains in Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army, the only one friendly\r\ntoward Kuan Yü, with the exception of Chang Liao, was Hsü Huang. The\r\nothers treated him with respect, except Tsʻai Yang who was decidedly\r\ninimical. So this Tsʻai was ready to pursue and capture him as soon as\r\nhe heard of his departure. But Tsʻao accepted his going as natural. “He\r\ndoes not forget his old leader and he was perfectly open in all his\r\nactions. He is a gentleman and you would do well to follow his\r\nexample.”\r\n\r\nSo he bade the would-be pursuer begone and say no more about pursuit.\r\n\r\n“You were exceedingly good to Kuan Yü,” said Chʻêng Yü, “but he went\r\noff very rudely. He certainly left a screed behind with his reasons,\r\nbut he affronted you and that is no light matter. Now to let him join\r\nYüan Shao is to add wings to a tiger. You had better catch him and put\r\nhim to death so as to guard against future evil.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “But he had my promise and can I break my word? Each has\r\nhis master. Do not pursue.” But he said to Chang Liao, “He has rejected\r\nall I gave him, so bribes were powerless with him in whatever shape. I\r\nhave the greatest respect for such as he. He has not yet gone far and I\r\nwill try to strengthen his attachment to me and make one appeal to\r\nsentiment. Ride after him and beg him to stop till I can come up and\r\nbid farewell and offer him a sum of money for his expenses and a\r\nfighting robe, that he may remember me kindly in after days.”\r\n\r\nSo Chang rode out quite alone; Tsʻao followed him leisurely with an\r\nescort of a score or so.\r\n\r\nNow the steed that Kuan Yü rode was “Red Hare” and he was very fast. No\r\none could have come up with him but that there was the ladies’ carriage\r\nto escort and so “Red Hare” had to be held in and go slow. Suddenly\r\nKuan Yü heard a shout behind him, a voice crying, “Go slowly,\r\nYün-chʻang.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and made out the person to be Chang Liao. Ordering the\r\npushers of the carriage to press on along the high road, he reined in\r\nhis steed, held Black Dragon ready for a stroke and waited for Chang\r\nLiao to come up.\r\n\r\n“Of course you have come to take me back, Wên-yüan?” said he.\r\n\r\n“No; the Minister, seeing that you are going a long journey, wishes to\r\nsee you on your way and told me to hasten forward and beg you to wait\r\ntill he can come up. That is the only thing.”\r\n\r\n“Seeing that he is coming along with mailed men I shall fight to the\r\nvery last,” said Kuan Yü and he took up his position on a bridge where\r\nhe waited the approach of the party, who advanced quickly. Four of\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s captains followed close. Seeing Kuan Yü was ready to\r\nfight, Tsʻao ordered his escort to open out in two lines and then it\r\nwas seen they carried no arms. This relieved his mind; for it proved to\r\nKuan Yü they meant no attack.\r\n\r\n“Why do you go in such haste, Yün-chʻang?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü inclined his head but did not dismount.\r\n\r\n“I informed you in writing that since my lord was in Hopei I had to\r\nleave at once. I went to your palace again and again but was refused\r\nadmittance. So I wrote a letter of farewell, sealed up the treasure,\r\nresigned my marquis seal and left everything for you. I hope you recall\r\nthe promise you once made me.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “My desire is to keep my troth with all men; I cannot go\r\nback on my word. However, you may find the journey expensive and\r\ntherefore I have here prepared a sum of money to help you.”\r\n\r\nThen from horseback he held out a packet of gold.\r\n\r\n“I have sufficient left from your former bounty; keep that for presents\r\nto your soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you refuse this? It is but an insignificant return for\r\ngreat services.”\r\n\r\n“My services have been all trifling, not worth mentioning.”\r\n\r\n“Really, Yün-chʻang, you are the most high-principled of men. I am very\r\nsorry my luck is too poor to retain you at my side. Pray accept just\r\nthis robe to show you I am not quite ungrateful,” said Tsʻao, and one\r\nof his captains, dismounting, held up a silken coat in both hands. Kuan\r\nYü even still fearful of what might happen, would not dismount, but he\r\nreached down his sword and took the robe on its point. Then he threw it\r\nover his shoulders and turned to thank the giver saying, “I thank you,\r\nSir Minister, for the robe and trust we shall meet again.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he went down from the bridge and bore away to the north.\r\n\r\n“He is a very rude man,” said Hsü Chʻu, who was of the escort. “Why do\r\nyou not take him prisoner?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “He was absolutely alone facing scores of us; he was\r\njustified in being suspicious. But my word has gone forth and he is not\r\nto be pursued.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao and his escort returned, the Minister very sad when he thought of\r\nthe man who had gone.\r\n\r\nBut here we need say nothing more of Tsʻao’s return. Kuan Yü went down\r\nfrom the bridge and started in the wake of the carriage carrying the\r\ntwo ladies, which should have gone about thirty li while this interview\r\nhad been going on. He could see no signs of it and rode hither and\r\nthither looking on all sides.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard some one shouting from a hill, calling him by name\r\nto halt. He saw a youth wearing a yellow turban and dressed in a silk\r\nrobe. He held a spear in his hand and was mounted on a horse from the\r\nneck of which dangled a bloody head. Behind him were a hundred or so\r\nmen on foot and they advanced quickly.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nThe young man dropped his spear, dismounted and made a low bow. Kuan\r\nfeared this was some ruse so he only checked his horse and gripped his\r\nsword the more firmly, saying, “Sir Swashbuckler, I desire you to tell\r\nme your name.”\r\n\r\n“My family name is Liao and I am known as Liao Hua or Liao Yüan-chien.\r\nI belong to a Hsiangyang family. Since these troubled times began I\r\nhave been an outlaw among the rivers and lakes and I and my comrades\r\nhave lived by plunder. We are about five hundred in all. By chance my\r\nfriend Tu Yüan came across two ladies in a carriage just now and, quite\r\nwrongly, he took them prisoners and brought them to the hold in the\r\nhills. I questioned the servants and so found out who they were and who\r\nwas escorting them. So I wished them to be set free to pursue their\r\njourney. My friend opposed this and spoke so ill-mannerly that I killed\r\nhim. And here is his head. I pray you to pardon me.”\r\n\r\n“Where are the two ladies?”\r\n\r\n“They are among the hills,” replied Liao.\r\n\r\n“Bring them down here, at once,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\nIn a short time a party of the brigands pushed the carriage down the\r\nhill and the ladies sat there before him.\r\n\r\nThen Kuan Yü dismounted, laid aside his sword and stood respectfully\r\nbefore them with his arms crossed.\r\n\r\n“Sisters, have you been alarmed?” asked he.\r\n\r\nThey replied, “We should have suffered at the hands of Tu Yüan had it\r\nnot been for Liao Hua.”\r\n\r\n“How did Liao Hua come to save the ladies?” asked Kuan of those who\r\nstood by.\r\n\r\nThey said, “Tu carried off the ladies and proposed that he and Liao Hua\r\nshould have one each as wife. But Liao Hua had found out they were of\r\ngentle birth and worthy, and was for treating them with respect. When\r\nTu disagreed Liao slew him.”\r\n\r\nHearing this Kuan Yü bowed to Liao Hua and thanked him. Liao then\r\nwanted to join himself and his troop to Kuan Yü, but the latter, seeing\r\nhe was a Yellow Turban, would have nothing to do with him. So he simply\r\nthanked him for his kindness to the ladies. Liao offered some presents\r\nbut these were also declined.\r\n\r\nSo Liao Hua took his leave and presently disappeared in a valley among\r\nthe hills. Kuan Yü told his sisters the story of his interview with\r\nTsʻao and the gift of a robe and then he urged the carriage on its way.\r\nTowards dark they came to a farm where they would rest. The farmer, an\r\nold greybeard, came out to welcome the party and asked who they were.\r\nKuan Yü described himself as the brother of Liu Pei, and said his name\r\nwas Kuan.\r\n\r\n“Surely you are no other than the slayer of Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou,”\r\nsaid the venerable host.\r\n\r\n“That is so,” replied Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said the old man, joyfully.\r\n\r\n“My two sisters-in-law are in the carriage” said Kuan Yü, “will you let\r\nyour women-folk go out to receive them?”\r\n\r\nAs Kuan Yü remained standing there the host asked him to be seated, but\r\nhe would not sit while the women were present and remained standing in\r\na respectful attitude till the old man’s wife had returned and ushered\r\nthe ladies into the inner apartments. Then the old man set to the\r\nentertainment of his guest in the guest hall. Kuan Yü asked his name.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “I am called Hu Hua. In the days of the Emperor Huan I was\r\nan officer of the Court but I resigned and retired into private life. I\r\nhave a son with the Prefect of Yungyang (in Szechuan) and if you should\r\nbe going that way, General, I should like to send him a letter by you.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü said he would take the letter. Next day, after an early meal,\r\nthe ladies got into their carriage, the host handed his letter to Kuan\r\nYü, and the little party once more took the road. They went toward\r\nLoyang.\r\n\r\nPresently they approached a pass known as the Tungling Pass, guarded by\r\none Kʻung Hsiu and half a company. When the soldiers saw a carriage\r\nbeing pushed toward the pass they ran to tell their commander, who came\r\nout to accost the travellers. Kuan Yü dismounted and returned the\r\nofficer’s salute and the latter said, “Whither are you going?”\r\n\r\n“I have left the Minister to go into Hopei to find my brother.”\r\n\r\n“But Yüan Shao is my master’s rival. You have authority from him to go\r\nthither?”\r\n\r\n“I left hurriedly and could not get it.”\r\n\r\n“If you have no authority you must wait while I send to request\r\norders.”\r\n\r\n“To remain while you send and receive an answer will delay me greatly,”\r\nsaid Kuan.\r\n\r\n“I must stand by my instructions; that is the only thing to do,” said\r\nKʻung.\r\n\r\n“Then you refuse to let me pass?”\r\n\r\n“If you want to go through leave the family as a gage.”\r\n\r\nAt this Kuan Yü got very angry and made to cut at the officer on the\r\nspot, but he withdrew into the gate and beat the drums for an attack.\r\nThereupon the soldiers armed themselves, mounted and came down to\r\noppose the passage, crying, “Dare you go through, eh?”\r\n\r\nThe carriage was sent off to a safe distance and then Kuan Yü rode at\r\nfull speed directly at the commander of the guard, who set his spear\r\nand came to meet him. The two steeds met and the men engaged, but at\r\nthe first stroke of Black Dragon the commander of the gate fell to the\r\nearth dead. His men fled.\r\n\r\n“Soldiers, do not flee!” cried Kuan Yü. “I killed him because I could\r\ndo no otherwise. I have nothing against you, but I would ask you to\r\ntell the Minister how this thing came to pass, that he wished to kill\r\nme and so I slew him in self-defence.”\r\n\r\nThe men bowed before him and Kuan Yü, with the carriage, passed through\r\nthe gates and they continued their way to Loyang. But one of the guards\r\nof the pass went quickly in advance and informed the Prefect of Loyang,\r\nHan Fu, of the slaughter of Kʻung Hsiu. Wherefore Han Fu assembled his\r\nofficers to take counsel. Mêng Tʻan, one of his captains, said, “This\r\nKuan Yü must be a fugitive or he would have a safe-conduct. Our only\r\ncourse is to stop him or we shall incur blame.”\r\n\r\n“The man is fierce and brave. Remember the fate of Yen and Wên. It\r\nseems vain to oppose him by force and so we must think out some trap\r\nfor him,” said Han Fu.\r\n\r\n“I have a ruse ready,” said Mêng Tʻan. “I will close the gate with\r\n“deerhorns” (chevaux de frise) and I will go to fight with him. I will\r\nengage and then flee, and you can shoot him from an ambush along the\r\nroad. If we can get him and his party and send them prisoners to the\r\ncapital we ought to be well rewarded.”\r\n\r\nThis course was determined upon and soon they heard that Kuan Yü was\r\napproaching. Han Fu strung his bow and filled his quiver with arrows\r\nand with one company took up position along the pass. Then as the party\r\napproached Han Fu said, “Who is the traveller who comes?”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü bowed low and said, “He is a certain Kuan, Marquis of\r\nHanshoutʻing, and he wishes to go through the pass.”\r\n\r\n“Have you a letter from the Minister?”\r\n\r\n“In the hurry of departure I did not get any.”\r\n\r\n“My special orders from him are to hold this pass and make examination\r\nof all spies that may go to and fro. Any person without an authority\r\nmust be a fugitive.”\r\n\r\nThen Kuan Yü began to be angry, and he told them what had happened to\r\nKʻung Hsiu. “Do you also seek death?” asked Kuan.\r\n\r\n“Who will capture him for me?” cried Han Fu, and Mêng Tʻan offered\r\nhimself. He rode out, whirling his double swords and made straight for\r\nKuan Yü.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü sent back the carriage out of danger and then rode toward Mêng.\r\nThey engaged, but very soon Mêng turned his steed and fled. Kuan Yü\r\npursued. Mêng, intent only on leading his enemy toward the ambush, took\r\nno account of the speed of “Red Hare.” Very soon he was caught up and a\r\nstroke of the mighty sword cut him in two pieces. Then Kuan Yü stopped\r\nand turned back. The archers in the gate shot their hardest and though\r\nit was a long way off one of them lodged an arrow in his left arm. He\r\npulled it out with his teeth but the blood streamed down as he rode\r\ntoward the Prefect, Han Fu. The men scattered. Kuan Yü rode straight at\r\nhis next victim. He raised his sword and made an oblique cut which\r\nsliced off the head and shoulder of his opponent.\r\n\r\nThen he drove off the soldiers and returned to escort the carriage. He\r\nbound up his wound, and, fearing lest any one might take advantage of\r\nhis weakness, he made no long halts on the road but hurried toward\r\nIshui Pass.\r\n\r\nThe warden of this pass was Pien Hsi of Pingchou, a warrior whose\r\nweapon was a comet-hammer. He had been a Yellow Turban and had gone\r\nover to Tsʻao, who had given him this post. As soon as he heard of the\r\ncoming of the redoubtable warrior he cudgelled his brains for a ruse to\r\nuse against him. He decided upon an ambush. In a temple at the pass he\r\nplaced two hundred “axe and sword” men. He reckoned on enticing Kuan to\r\nthe temple for refreshment and when he let fall a cup as signal the\r\nhidden men would rush out.\r\n\r\nAll being thus arranged and ready, he went out to welcome Kuan Yü in\r\nfriendly guise and he dismounted at his coming. Pien Hsi began very\r\namiably.\r\n\r\n“Your name, General, makes the very earth tremble and every one looks\r\nup to you. This return to the Imperial Uncle proves you to be noble and\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü in reply told him the story of the men he had slain. Hsi\r\nreplied, “You slew them; that is well. When I see the Minister I will\r\nexplain to him the inner reasons for these acts.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü thought he had found a friend and so mounted and rode through\r\nthe pass. When he came to the temple a number of priests came out to\r\nmeet him with clanging bells.\r\n\r\nThis temple, that of a Guardian of the State, had a courtyard in which\r\nthe Emperor Ming had burned incense. In the temple were thirty priests\r\nand among these there happened to be one who came from the same village\r\nas Kuan Yü. His religious name was Pʻu-ching. Hearing who the visitor\r\nwas, he came forward to speak with him.\r\n\r\n“General,” said he, “it is many a long year since you left Putung.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Kuan Yü, “nearly twenty years.”\r\n\r\n“Do you recognise this poor priest?”\r\n\r\n“I left the village many years ago; I do not recognise you.”\r\n\r\n“My house and yours were only separated by a rivulet,” said the priest.\r\n\r\nNow Pien Hsi, seeing the priest holding forth about village matters,\r\nthought he would blab about the ambush, so he bade him be silent.\r\n\r\n“I want to invite the General to a feast. You priest fellows seem to\r\nhave a lot to say,” said Pien.\r\n\r\n“Not too much,” said Kuan Yü. “Naturally when fellow villagers meet\r\nthey talk of old times.”\r\n\r\nPʻu-ching invited the visitor into the guest room to take tea, but Kuan\r\nYü said, “The two ladies are out there in the carriage; they ought to\r\nhave some first.”\r\n\r\nSo the priest bade them take some tea to the ladies and then he led\r\nKuan Yü within, at the same time lifting the priest knife which he wore\r\nat his side and looking meaningly at Kuan Yü. The latter understood and\r\ntold his people to bring along his weapon and keep close at his side.\r\n\r\nWhen Pien Hsi invited Kuan Yü to go into the Hall of the Law for some\r\nrefreshment, Kuan Yü turned to him, saying, “Is this invitation with\r\ngood intention or evil?”\r\n\r\nHis host was so taken aback that he could make no reply, and then Kuan\r\nYü saw that many armed men were concealed behind the arras. Then he\r\nshouted loudly at Pien Hsi, saying, “What means this? I thought you an\r\nhonourable man. How dare you?”\r\n\r\nThe traitor saw that his plot had failed and called to the assassins to\r\ncome out and fall to, but Kuan Yü had a short sword in his hand and\r\nslashed at any one who came near. So they scattered. Their commander\r\nran down the hall and tried to escape among the side buildings, but\r\nKuan Yü threw aside the short sword, took up Black Dragon and went\r\nafter Pien Hsi. The latter was trying to get into position to throw his\r\ncomet-hammer, but Kuan Yü cut the cord and the weapon was useless. He\r\nfollowed Pien in and out and soon caught up with him. Then with one\r\nblow he cut him in halves.\r\n\r\nThe fight over he sought the two ladies, who were surrounded by\r\nsoldiers. These fled at sight of the terrible warrior. Seeking out the\r\npriest, his fellow countryman, he thanked him for the timely warning\r\nwhich had saved him from death.\r\n\r\n“I cannot remain here after this,” said Pʻu-ching. “I shall pack up my\r\nfew garments and my alms bowl and take to the road, vague in my\r\nwanderings as the clouds in the sky. But we shall meet again and till\r\nthen take care of yourself.”\r\n\r\nThen Kuan Yü took leave and retook the road to Yungyang. The Prefect of\r\nthis city was named Wang Chih, and he was related to Han Fu by\r\nmarriage. Hearing of the death of his relative he set about a scheme to\r\nkill Kuan Yü secretly. He sent men to guard the city gates and, when he\r\nheard that Kuan Yü approached, he went himself and received him with a\r\nsmiling countenance and bade him welcome. Kuan Yü told him the object\r\nof his journey.\r\n\r\n“You, General, have been able to get some exercise on the road, but the\r\nladies in their carriage must be cramped and fatigued. I pray you to\r\ncome into the city and all of you remain the night in the official\r\ntravellers’ quarters. To-morrow you can set forth again.”\r\n\r\nThe offer was tempting and his host seemed in earnest so the two ladies\r\nwent into the city, where they found everything very comfortably\r\nprepared for them. And, though Kuan Yü declined the Prefect’s\r\ninvitations to a banquet, refreshments for the travellers were sent to\r\ntheir lodgings. Kuan Yü was fatigued from the trials of the journey and\r\nas soon as the evening meal was over he bade the ladies retire to rest\r\nwhile he sat down in the main room, quite alone, for he bade all to get\r\nrepose while they could. His horse was given a good feed for once. He\r\nsat with his armour loosened in order to be more at ease.\r\n\r\nNow the Prefect had a secretary named Hu Pan to whom he had entrusted\r\nthe arrangements for the destruction of his guest. Said he, “This Kuan\r\nis a traitor to the Minister and a fugitive. On the road he has\r\nmurdered several Commanders of Passes and is guilty of serious crimes.\r\nBut he is too strong and valiant for any ordinary soldier to overcome.\r\nSo this evening a whole company of men will surround his lodging, each\r\none armed with a torch, and we will burn him. They will start the fire\r\nabout midnight. Every one of the party will perish. I will come with a\r\nforce to stand by and assist if necessary.”\r\n\r\nThese orders received, Hu Pan passed them on to the men, who began\r\nsecretly to prepare dry wood and other combustibles which they piled up\r\nat the gate of the rest-house. Hu Pan thought within him that he would\r\nlike to know what manner of man was this Kuan Yü, whose fame had spread\r\nso far, so he determined to get a peep at him. He went to the\r\nrest-house and enquired where Kuan Yü was.\r\n\r\n“The General is the man in the main hall reading,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nHu Pan noiselessly made his way to the outside of the room and peeped\r\nin. He saw the famous warrior stroking his beard with his left hand\r\nwhile he read by the light of a lamp placed on a low table. An\r\ninvoluntary exclamation of wonder escaped at the majesty of the figure.\r\n\r\n“Really a god!” he sighed.\r\n\r\n“Who is there?” suddenly asked the reader at the sound.\r\n\r\nHu Pan entered and said he was the Prefect’s secretary.\r\n\r\n“Surely you are the son of Hu Hua, who lives outside Hsütu,” said Kuan.\r\n\r\n“I am he,” replied Hu Pan.\r\n\r\nThen Kuan Yü called up his followers and bade them look among the\r\nbaggage for the letter, which they brought. Kuan Yü handed it to the\r\nsecretary, who read it and then breathed long, saying, “I very nearly\r\ncaused the death of a good man.”\r\n\r\nThen he betrayed the whole plot. “This Wang is a wicked man, who wanted\r\nto kill you. At this moment you are surrounded and at the third watch\r\nthey will set fire to this place. Now I will go and open the city gates\r\nwhile you hastily prepare for flight.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was greatly surprised, but he quickly buckled up his armour,\r\ngot his steed ready, roused the two ladies and put them into their\r\ncarriage. Then they left the rest-house and as they passed out they saw\r\nthe soldiers all about them, each with a torch. The party hastened to\r\nthe outskirts of the city and found the gate already open and they lost\r\nno time in getting clear of the city. Hu Pan returned to give orders to\r\nfire the rest house.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives pressed on but before long they saw lights coming up\r\nbehind them and Wang Chih called out to them to stop. Kuan Yü reined in\r\nhis horse and began to abuse him.\r\n\r\n“Worthless fellow! What had you against me that you wished to burn me\r\nto death?”\r\n\r\nWang Chih whipped up his steed and set his spear, but Kuan Yü cut him\r\nthrough with the short sword he wore at his side and scattered his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nThen the carriage pushed on. Kuan Yü’s heart was filled with gratitude\r\nto Hu Pan. When they drew near Huachou some one told Liu Yen, who rode\r\nout to welcome him. Kuan Yü did not dismount but bowed from horseback,\r\nsaying, “Have you been quite well since we parted?”\r\n\r\n“Whither are you going, Sir?” replied Liu Yen.\r\n\r\n“I have left the Minister and am on my way to find my brother.”\r\n\r\n“Yüan-tê is with Yüan Shao, who is at enmity with the Minister. How can\r\nyou be allowed to go to him?” asked Liu Yen.\r\n\r\n“That matter was settled long ago.”\r\n\r\n“The Yellow River ferry is an important point and is guarded by a\r\nlieutenant of Hsiahou Tun; he will not let you cross.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose then you provide boats for me?”\r\n\r\n“Though there are boats I dare not give them to you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, formerly I slew Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou and saved you from a\r\ngrave danger. Now you refuse me a ferry boat!”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid Hsiahou will know of it and make it a fault against me.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü perceived that no help was to be expected from this man so he\r\npushed on and presently reached the ferry. There the commander of the\r\nguard, Chʻin Chʻi, came out to question him.\r\n\r\n“I am one Kuan, Marquis of Hanshoutʻing.”\r\n\r\n“Whither are you bound?”\r\n\r\n“I go to Hopei to seek my brother, Liu Yüan-tê, and I respectfully ask\r\nyou to grant me a passage over the river.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the authority of the Minister?”\r\n\r\n“I am not on a mission from the Minister so why should I have such an\r\nauthority?”\r\n\r\n“I have orders from my chief to guard the ferry and you will not cross;\r\neven if you grew wings you should not fly over.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü’s choler arose. “Do you know that I have been the death of all\r\nthose who have hitherto tried to stop me?” said he.\r\n\r\n“You have only slain a few officers of no rank or reputation; but you\r\ndare not kill me.”\r\n\r\n“Where would you stand beside Yen Liang and Wên Chʻou?” asked Kuan.\r\n\r\nThen Chʻin Chʻi grew angry and he loosed his rein. Sword in hand he\r\ncame at a gallop. The two met, but in the first encounter Chʻin Chʻi’s\r\nhead was swept off by the terrible Black Dragon.\r\n\r\n“He who opposed me is dead; you others need not be afraid,” cried Kuan\r\nYü. “Be quick and prepare me a boat.”\r\n\r\nThe boat was soon at the landing and the two women stepped on board,\r\nfollowed by Kuan Yü. They crossed, and were then in the country of Yüan\r\nShao. In the course of his journey to this point Kuan Yü had forced\r\nfive passes and slain six captains.\r\n\r\n\r\n    His seal hung up, the treasury locked, his courtly mansion left,\r\n    He journeyed toward his brother dear, too long from his side reft.\r\n    The horse he rode was famed for speed as for endurance great,\r\n    His good sword made a way for him and opened every gate.\r\n    His loyalty and truth forth stand, a pattern unto all,\r\n    His valour would frighten rushing streams and make high mountains\r\n                                                                  fall.\r\n    Alone he travelled lustily, ’twas death to meet his blade,\r\n    He has been themed by myriads, his glory ne’er will fade.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I did not willingly slay a single one of them,” mused Kuan Yü as he\r\nrode along. “There was no help for it. Nevertheless when Tsʻao hears of\r\nit he will regard me as ungrateful for his bounty.”\r\n\r\nBefore long he saw a rider on the road who soon hailed him and proved\r\nto be Sun Chʻien.\r\n\r\n“I have never heard a word from you since we lost sight of each other\r\nat Junan; how have you fared?” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“After your departure the city fell. I was sent to Yüan Shao to try to\r\nmake peace with him and succeeded, so that he invited your brother to\r\ngo to him and share in the deliberations for an attack on Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\nBut to my disgust the leaders of Yüan Shao’s army showed great jealousy\r\nof each other so that one got into gaol, another was degraded and\r\nothers quarrelled. Then Yüan Shao vacillated and hesitated, so that\r\nyour brother and I consulted how we might get away from them all. Now\r\nthe Uncle is at Junan with Liu Pʻi and, thinking you could not know\r\nthat and might suffer some harm if you unwillingly went to Yüan Shao, I\r\nhave come to warn you. It is good fortune to find you like this. Now we\r\ncan hasten to Junan and you will meet your brother.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü took Sun Chʻien to make his bow to the ladies, who asked after\r\nhis adventures and he told them of the risks Liu Pei had run from Yüan\r\nShao’s sudden bursts of anger. Now, however, he was out of his way and\r\nsafe at Junan where they would meet him.\r\n\r\nThey covered their faces and wept at the recital of his dangers. Then\r\nthe party no longer travelled north but took the road toward Junan. Not\r\nlong after a great cloud of dust was noticed behind them and they\r\npresently made out a squadron of horsemen. These were led by Hsiahou\r\nTun, who shouted out to Kuan Yü to stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n    One by one the pass commanders stopped his progress and were slain,\r\n    The river crossed, another army comes and he must fight again.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow finally Kuan Yü escaped death will appear in the succeeding\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTSʻAI YANG PUT TO DEATH, THE BROTHERS’ DOUBTS DISAPPEAR:\r\nMEETING AT KUCHʻENG, LORD AND LIEGE FORTIFY EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien had joined Kuan Yü in escorting the two ladies and they were\r\non the road to Junan when Hsiahou Tun suddenly determined to pursue. So\r\nwith a couple of hundred horse he set out. When he was seen\r\napproaching, Kuan Yü bade Sun Chʻien go ahead with the carriage while\r\nhe remained to deal with the pursuers. When they were near enough Kuan\r\nYü said, “In coming after me thus you do not reinforce the magnanimity\r\nof your master.”\r\n\r\nReplied Hsiahou Tun, “The Minister has sent no definite instructions.\r\nYou have caused the death of several people, among them one of my\r\nlieutenants, and so I have come to capture you. You have behaved most\r\ngrossly. He will decide.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he dashed forward with his spear ready to thrust. But at that\r\nmoment a rider came up behind him at full gallop crying, “You must not\r\nfight with Yün-chʻang.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü stayed his steed at once and waited. The messenger came up,\r\ndrew from his bosom an official letter and said to Hsiahou Tun, “The\r\nMinister loves General Kuan for his loyalty and honour, and fearing\r\nlest he might be stopped at the various passes, he sent me with this\r\nletter to show when necessary at any point on the road.”\r\n\r\n“But this Kuan has slain several commanders of the passes; does the\r\nMinister know that?” said Tun.\r\n\r\nThe messenger said these things were unknown.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Tun, “I will arrest him and take him to the Minister, who\r\nmay set him free or not as he wills.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I fear anything you can do?” said Kuan Yü getting\r\nwrathful.\r\n\r\nAnd he rode forward. Tun, nothing loth, set his spear and prepared for\r\nbattle. They met and had reached the tenth encounter when a second\r\nhorseman came up at full speed, crying, “Generals, wait a little!”\r\n\r\nHsiahou Tun stayed his hand and asked the messenger, saying, “Am I to\r\narrest him?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the messenger. “Fearing lest he should have difficulties\r\nat the passes the Minister has sent me with a despatch to say he is to\r\nbe released.”\r\n\r\n“Did the Minister know that he had slain several men on the way?”\r\n\r\n“He did not know.”\r\n\r\n“Since he was ignorant of that I may not let him go,” and he gave the\r\nsignal to his men to close in round Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nBut Kuan Yü flourished his sword and made to attack them and a fight\r\nwas again imminent, when a third rider appeared, who cried,\r\n“Yün-chʻang, give way and do not fight!”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Chang Liao. Both combatants made no further move but\r\nawaited his arrival.\r\n\r\nHe said, “I bring the Minister’s order that since he has heard that\r\nYün-chʻang has slain certain men on the way he fears that some will\r\nhinder his passage. Wherefore he has sent me to deliver his command at\r\neach gate that Kuan Yü is to be suffered to pass freely.”\r\n\r\nHsiahou Tun said, “Chʻin Chʻi was the son of Tsʻai Yang’s sister, and\r\nhe was confided to my especial care. Now this Kuan has killed him and\r\nhow can I refrain?”\r\n\r\n“When I see his uncle I will explain. But now the main point is that\r\nyou have the Minister’s orders to let Kuan Yü pass and you may not\r\ndespise his wish.”\r\n\r\nSo the only thing for Hsiahou Tun to do was to retire; and he did.\r\n\r\n“Whither are you going?” then said Chang Liao to Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“I fear my brother is no longer with Yüan Shao and now I am going to\r\nfind him wherever he is.”\r\n\r\n“As you do not know where to go, why not return to the Minister?”\r\n\r\n“Where is the sense of that?” said Kuan Yü with a smile. “But,\r\nWên-yüan, you return, and try to arrange pardon for my faults.”\r\n\r\nWith this he saluted Chang Liao and took his leave. Chang Liao retired\r\nand joined Hsiahou Tun.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü quickly regained the carriage, and as they went along side by\r\nside he told Sun Chʻien what had happened. Several days later a heavy\r\nrain storm came on which soaked everything. Looking about for\r\nprotection they noticed a farm under the shelter of a precipice and\r\ntook their way thither. An old man came out to them, to whom they told\r\ntheir story. When they had finished, the old fellow said, “My name is\r\nKuo Chʻang and I have lived here many years. I am very pleased to greet\r\nthe man whom I have known so long by reputation.”\r\n\r\nHe quickly killed a sheep for their refreshment and brought out wine\r\nfor the two men. The two ladies were entertained in the inner\r\napartments. And while they refreshed themselves their baggage was put\r\nout to dry and their steeds were fed.\r\n\r\nAs the day closed in they saw several youths come along and their host\r\nsaid, “My son is come to pay his respects.”\r\n\r\n“This is my stupid son,” said he, presenting a lad to Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“What has he been doing?” asked Kuan.\r\n\r\n“He has just come in from hunting.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow went out. The old man continued, “All my family have\r\nbeen farmers or scholars. He is my only son and instead of following in\r\nthe footsteps of his ancestors he cares for nothing but gadding about\r\nand hunting, unhappily.”\r\n\r\n“Why unhappily?” said Kuan Yü. “In these days of disorder a good\r\nsoldier can make a name for himself.”\r\n\r\n“If he would only learn the military arts that would be something of a\r\ncareer, but he is nothing but a vagabond and does everything he should\r\nnot. He is a grief to me.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü sighed in sympathy. The old gentleman stayed till a late hour\r\nand when he took his leave his two guests began to prepare for rest.\r\n\r\nSuddenly outside there arose a great hubbub, men shouting and horses\r\nneighing. Kuan Yü called to his people, but as no one answered he and\r\nhis companion drew their swords and went into the stable yard. There\r\nthey found their host’s son on the ground shouting to his followers to\r\nfight. Kuan Yü asked what it was all about and his men told him that\r\nthe young fellow had tried to steal Red Hare, but had been badly\r\nkicked. They had heard shouting and had gone to see what it meant when\r\nthe farm people had set on them.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was very wrathful. “You mean thieves! Would you steal my\r\nhorse?” cried he.\r\n\r\nBut before he could do anything his host came running out saying, “It\r\nwas not with my consent that my son did this evil thing. I know he is\r\nvery guilty and deserves death. But his mother loves him tenderly and I\r\npray you to be generous and pardon him.”\r\n\r\n“Really he is unworthy of his father,” said Kuan Yü. “What you told me\r\nshows he is a degenerate. For your sake I pardon him.”\r\n\r\nThen he told his own people to keep a better lookout, sent the farm\r\npeople about their business and, in company with Sun Chʻien, went away\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\nNext morning both host and hostess were up betimes waiting to thank him\r\nfor forgiving their son’s mad freak. “My currish son has insulted your\r\ntiger dignity, I know, and I am deeply affected by your kindness in not\r\npunishing him,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Bring him here and I will talk to him,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“He went out before daylight with a lot of his fellow-rogues and I know\r\nnot where he is.”\r\n\r\nSo Kuan Yü bade them farewell, got the ladies into their carriage and\r\nthey moved out of the farmyard, the two warriors riding abreast as\r\nescort. They took the road toward the hills.\r\n\r\nBefore they had gone far they saw a large party of men, led by a couple\r\nof riders, pouring down one of the gullies. One of the riders wore a\r\nyellow turban and a battle robe. The other was Kuo Chʻang’s son. The\r\nwearer of the turban called out saying, “I am one of the captains of\r\nthe Celestial Duke, Chang Chio. Whoever you may be, leave that horse\r\nyou are riding for me. You may then go free.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü greeted the speech with a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n“O you mad ignoramus! If you had ever been with Chang Chio as a bandit\r\nyou would have learned to know Liu, Kuan and Chang, the three\r\nbrothers.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of the ruddy long beard called Kuan but I have never seen\r\nhim. Who may you be?”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü then laid aside his sword, stopped his horse and drew off the\r\nbag that covered his beard thus showing its magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe turban wearer immediately slipped out of the saddle, laid an angry\r\nhand on his companion and they both bowed low in front of Kuan Yü’s\r\nsteed.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“I am Pʻei Yüan-shao. After the death of Chang Chio I was left forlorn\r\nand I got together a few others like myself and we took refuge in the\r\nforests. This morning early this fellow came to tell us that a guest at\r\nhis father’s farm had a valuable horse and proposed to me to steal it.\r\nI did not think I should meet you, General.”\r\n\r\nThe wretched youth Kuo implored that his life might be spared and Kuan\r\nYü pardoned him for his father’s sake. He covered his face and crept\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“You did not recognise me; how then did you know my name?” asked Kuan\r\nYü.\r\n\r\nPʻei replied, “Not far from here is a mountain called the Sleeping\r\nBull, where lives a certain Chou Tsʻang, a very powerful man who came\r\nfrom the west. He has a stiff curly beard and looks very handsome. He\r\nalso was a captain in the rebel army, who took to the forest when his\r\nleader perished. He has told me a lot about you but I have never had\r\nthe happiness of seeing you.”\r\n\r\nSaid Kuan Yü, “Under the greenwood tree is no place for a hero’s foot.\r\nYou had better abandon this depraved life and return to the path of\r\nvirtue. Do not work out your own destruction.”\r\n\r\nAs they were talking a troop of horsemen appeared in the distance. They\r\nwere the men of Chou Tsʻang, as Pʻei said, and Kuan Yü waited for them\r\nto approach. The leader was very dark complexioned, tall and armed with\r\na spear. As soon as he drew near enough to see he exclaimed joyfully,\r\n“This is General Kuan.”\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had slipped out of the saddle and was on his knees by\r\nthe roadside.\r\n\r\n“Chou Tsʻang renders obeisance,” said he.\r\n\r\nSaid Kuan Yü, “O warrior, where have you known me?”\r\n\r\n“I was one of the Yellow Turbans and I saw you then. My one regret was\r\nthat I could not join you. Now that my good fortune has brought me here\r\nI hope you will not reject me. Let me be one of your foot soldiers to\r\nbe always near you to carry your whip and run by your stirrup. I will\r\ncheerfully die for you.”\r\n\r\nAs he seemed thoroughly in earnest Kuan Yü said, “But if you follow me,\r\nwhat of your companions?”\r\n\r\n“They may do as they please; follow me or go their ways.”\r\n\r\nThereupon they all shouted, “We will follow.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü dismounted and went to ask the ladies what they thought of\r\nthis. The Lady Kan replied, “Brother-in-law, you have travelled thus\r\nfar alone and without fighting men; you have safely passed many dangers\r\nand never wanted their assistance. You refused the service of Liao Hua,\r\nwhy then suffer this crowd? But this is only a woman’s view and you\r\nmust decide.”\r\n\r\n“What you say, sister-in-law, is to the point.”\r\n\r\nTherefore returning to Chou Tsʻang he said, “It is not that I am\r\nlacking in gratitude but my sisters-in-law do not care for a large\r\nfollowing. Wherefore return to the mountains till I shall have found my\r\nbrother when I will surely call you.”\r\n\r\nChou Tsʻang replied, “I am only a rough uncouth fellow, wasting his\r\nlife as a brigand. Meeting you, General, is like seeing the full sun in\r\nthe skies and I feel that I can never bear to miss you again. As it\r\nmight be inconvenient for all my men to follow you I will bid my\r\ncompanion lead them away, but I will come and follow you on foot\r\nwherever you go.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü again asked his sisters-in-law what they thought of this. Lady\r\nKan said one or two made no difference and so Kuan Yü consented. But\r\nPʻei Yüan-shao was not satisfied with this arrangement and said he\r\nwished also to follow.\r\n\r\nChou said, “If you do not stay with the band they will disperse and be\r\nlost. You must take command for the moment and let me accompany General\r\nKuan. As soon as he has a fixed abode I will come to fetch you.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat discontentedly Pʻei Yüan-shao accepted the situation and\r\nmarched off, while his one-time colleague joined the train of Kuan Yü\r\nand they went toward Junan. They travelled quickly for some days and\r\nthen they saw a city on a hill. From the natives they heard that the\r\ncity was called Kuchʻêng and that a few months before a warrior had\r\nsuddenly appeared, driven out the magistrates and taken possession.\r\nThen he had begun to recruit men, buy up horses and lay in stores. The\r\nwarrior’s name was Chang Fei. Now he had a large force and no one in\r\nthe neighbourhood dared face him.\r\n\r\n“To think that I should find my brother like this!” said Kuan Yü,\r\ndelighted. “I have had never a word of him, nor knew I where he was\r\nsince Hsüchou fell.”\r\n\r\nSo he despatched Sun Chʻien into the city to tell its new commander to\r\ncome out to meet him and provide for their sisters-in-law.\r\n\r\nNow, after being separated from his brothers, Chang Fei had gone to the\r\nMangyang Hills, where he had remained a month or so while he sent far\r\nand near for tidings of Yüan-tê. Then as he happened to pass Kuchʻêng\r\nhe had sent in to borrow some grain, but had been refused. In revenge,\r\nhe had driven away the magistrate and taken possession of the city. He\r\nfound the place well suited to his needs at the moment.\r\n\r\nAs directed by Kuan Yü, Sun Chʻien entered the city and, after the\r\nusual ceremonies, told Chang Fei the news of both his brothers; that\r\nYüan-tê had left Yüan Shao and gone to Junan and that Kuan Yü, with\r\ntheir sisters-in-law, was at his gates. Chang Fei listened without a\r\nword till he came to the request to go out to meet him. At that point\r\nhe called for his armour and, when he had put it on, laid hold of his\r\nlong spear, mounted and rode out with a large company at his back. Sun\r\nChʻien was too astonished to ask what this meant and simply followed.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was very glad when he saw his brother coming, put up his\r\nweapons and, with Chou Tsʻang at his back, rode toward him at full\r\nspeed. But as he approached he saw all the signs of fierce anger on his\r\nbrother’s face and he roared as he shook his spear, threatening his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was entirely taken aback and called out anxiously, “Brother,\r\nwhat does this mean? Is the Peach Garden Pledge quite forgotten?”\r\n\r\n“What impudence is this that you come to see me since your disgraceful\r\nbehaviour?” shouted Chang.\r\n\r\n“What disgraceful behaviour has been mine?” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“You have betrayed your brother, you have surrendered to Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nand you have received title and office at his hands. And now you are\r\ncome to exploit me. One of us shall die.”\r\n\r\nKuan said, “Really you do not understand and it is hard for me to\r\nexplain. But ask the two ladies here, worthy brother, and they will\r\ntell you.”\r\n\r\nAt this the ladies lifted the curtain of the carriage and called out,\r\n“Brother, why is this?”\r\n\r\nFei said, “Wait a while, sisters, and see me slay this traitor. After\r\nthat I will conduct you into the city.”\r\n\r\nSaid the Lady Kan, “Since he knew not where you were our brother took\r\nshelter with Tsʻao Tsʻao. And since he knew that his elder brother was\r\nat Junan he has braved every danger to escort us thus far on the road.\r\nPray take a correct view of his conduct.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Mi also chimed in, “When your brother went to Hsütu no other\r\ncourse was open to him.”\r\n\r\n“Sisters, do not let him blind you to the truth. Real loyalty prefers\r\ndeath to dishonour. No good man can serve two masters.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü said, “Brother, cease to wrong me I pray you.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien said, “Yün-chʻang came expressly to seek you.”\r\n\r\n“How much more nonsense will you talk?” roared Chang Fei. “How can he\r\nbe true-hearted? He came to capture me, I say.”\r\n\r\n“Had I come to capture you, I should have come with men and horses,”\r\nsaid Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“And are there not men and horses?” said Chang Fei pointing to a point\r\nbehind Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü turned and there he saw a cloud of dust rising as though a\r\nsquadron of horse was coming. And soon they were near enough and from\r\ntheir trumpets and banners they showed themselves to be of Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s army.\r\n\r\n“Now will you try to cajole me further?” cried Chang Fei in a rage.\r\n\r\nHe set his long spear and was just coming on when Kuan Yü said,\r\n“Brother, wait a while; see me slay the leader of these that I may\r\nprove myself no traitor.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you are really true, prove it by slaying that leader, whoever\r\nhe may be, before I have finished three rolls of the drum.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei’s condition was accepted. Soon the attacking force was near\r\nenough to make out the leader to be Tsʻai Yang. Sword in hand he rode\r\nat full speed, crying, “So I have found you, slayer of my nephew! I\r\nhave a command to capture you and will execute it.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü made no reply. Raising his sword ready to strike he moved out\r\nand the drums began to beat. Before a roll could be completed the fight\r\nwas over and Tsʻai Yang’s head had rolled on the ground. His men\r\nscattered and fled. Kuan Yü, however, captured the young ensign-bearer\r\nand questioned him. The youth said that in very truth the Minister had\r\nnot given an order. Incensed at the loss of his nephew, Tsʻai wished to\r\npursue and attack Kuan Yü although the Minister refused permission. To\r\nsatisfy him he had sent Tsʻai to attack Junan and the meeting at this\r\nplace was entirely an accident.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü bade him repeat this story to his brother. Chang Fei also\r\nquestioned him concerning all that had happened in the capital and the\r\nrecital of the whole story satisfied him of the fidelity of Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nJust then messengers came from the city to Chang Fei to say that some\r\nscores of horsemen had arrived at the south gate. They seemed in a\r\ngreat hurry but no one knew them. Chang Fei, with still a lingering\r\ndoubt in his mind, went to look at the newcomers and there saw a score\r\nor two of mounted archers with light bows and short arrows. Hastily\r\ndismounting to see them better he found they were Mi Chu and Mi Fang.\r\nQuickly slipping out of the saddle they came up and Mi Chu said, “After\r\nthe dispersal at Hsüchou when we lost sight of you we returned to our\r\nvillage whence we sent all around for news of you. We heard that Kuan\r\nYü had surrendered to Tsʻao Tsʻao and our lord was in Hopei. The one of\r\nwhom we could hear nothing was yourself. But yesterday, while on our\r\nway, we fell in with some travellers who told us a certain General\r\nChang, of such and such an appearance, had suddenly occupied Kuchʻêng\r\nand we felt it must be you. So we came to enquire and we happily fell\r\nin with you here.”\r\n\r\nFei replied, “Kuan Yü and Sun Chʻien are here and my two sisters are\r\nwith them. They had heard where my elder brother was.”\r\n\r\nThis news added to the joy of the two newcomers who went to see Kuan Yü\r\nand the women and then they all entered the city. When the ladies had\r\nsettled down a little they related the whole story of the adventures on\r\nthe road at which Chang Fei was overcome with remorse and bowed before\r\nhis brother bitterly weeping. The brothers Mi were greatly affected.\r\nThen Chang Fei related what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nA day was spent in banquets and next day Chang Fei wished his newly\r\nfound brother to go with him to Junan to see their elder brother\r\nYüan-tê. But Kuan Yü said, “No; you take care of the ladies here while\r\nSun Chʻien and I go to get news.”\r\n\r\nSo Kuan Yü and Sun Chʻien with a small escort set out. When they\r\nreached Junan they were received by Liu Pʻi who told them their brother\r\nwas no longer in the city. After waiting some days he had come to the\r\nconclusion that the soldiers were too few and had gone back to Yüan\r\nShao to consult with him.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was greatly disappointed and his companion did his best to\r\nconsole him. “Do not be sorrowful; it only means the trouble of another\r\njourney into Hopei to tell Uncle Liu and then we can all meet at\r\nKuchʻêng.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Sun Chʻien and Kuan Yü accepted it. They took leave of Liu Pʻi\r\nand returned to Kuchʻêng where they related what had happened. Chang\r\nFei wanted to go with them into Hopei, but Kuan Yü opposed this,\r\nsaying, “Seeing you have this city it makes a rallying point for us and\r\na resting place. We must not abandon it lightly. We two will go and\r\nwhile away we look to you to keep the city safe.”\r\n\r\n“How can you go after killing the two generals, Yen Liang and Wên\r\nChʻou?”\r\n\r\n“That will not stop me. And after I am there I can act according to\r\ncircumstances.”\r\n\r\nThen he summoned Chou Tsʻang and asked him, saying, “How many men are\r\nthere with Pʻei at Sleeping Bull Mountain?”\r\n\r\n“I should think four or five hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Kuan Yü, “I am going to take the shortest road to find my\r\nbrother. Can you go to summon your men and lead them along the high\r\nroad to assist me?”\r\n\r\nWith instructions to bring up these men Chou Tsʻang left, while Kuan Yü\r\nand Sun Chʻien and their small escort went off to the north. When they\r\ndrew near the boundary Sun Chʻien said, “You must be careful how you go\r\nover; you ought to stop here while I go in, see Uncle Liu and take the\r\nnecessary steps.”\r\n\r\nSeeing the wisdom of this Kuan Yü stopped there and sent his companion\r\nin advance, he and his followers going up to a nearby farm as an\r\nabiding place.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the farm out came a venerable man leaning on a staff.\r\nAfter exchanging salutes Kuan Yü told the old man all about himself.\r\n\r\n“My name is also Kuan; my personal name being Ting,” said the old man.\r\n“I know your reputation and I am very happy to meet you.”\r\n\r\nHe sent for his two sons to come and make their bow. He put up Kuan in\r\nhis house and provided for his escort in the farm buildings.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sun Chʻien had made his way to Chʻichow and seen\r\nYüan-tê, who said, “Chien Yung also is here. We will send for him\r\nsecretly to talk over this matter.”\r\n\r\nThey did so, and when the usual salutes had been exchanged, they three\r\nbegan to consider the means of getting away.\r\n\r\n“You see Yüan Shao personally,” said Yung, “and say you wish to go to\r\nChingchou to see Liu Piao about a scheme for the destruction of our\r\nenemy. That will give an excuse.”\r\n\r\n“That seems best,” said Liu Pei, “but will you go with me?”\r\n\r\n“I have another plan to extricate myself,” said Yung.\r\n\r\nHaving settled their plans, Yüan-tê soon went in to see his protector\r\nand suggested that, as Liu Piao was strong and well posted, his help\r\nshould be sought against their enemy.\r\n\r\n“I have sent messengers repeatedly to ask his help,” said Shao, “but he\r\nis unwilling.”\r\n\r\n“As he and I are of the same family he will not refuse me if I go and\r\nask him,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Certainly he is worth much more than Liu Pʻi; you shall go.”\r\n\r\n“I have just heard,” Shao continued, “that Kuan Yün-chʻang has left\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao and wants to come here. If he does I will put him to death\r\nout of revenge for my two officers.”\r\n\r\n“Illustrious Sir, you wished to employ him and so I sent for him. Now\r\nyou threaten to put him to death. The two men he slew were but deer\r\ncompared with such a tiger as he is. When you exchange a couple of deer\r\nfor a tiger you need not complain of the bargain.”\r\n\r\n“Really I like him,” said Shao. “I was only joking. You can send\r\nanother messenger for him and tell him to come soon.”\r\n\r\n“May I send Sun Chʻien for him?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\nAfter Yüan-tê had gone Chien Yung came in and said to Shao, “If Yüan-tê\r\ngoes he will not come back. I had better go to speak to Liu Piao. And I\r\ncan keep a watch on Liu Pei.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao agreed and issued orders for both to go.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the mission Kuo Tʻu came in to his chief to dissuade\r\nhim. Said he, “He went to speak to Liu Pʻi, but he accomplished\r\nnothing. Now you are sending Chien Yung with him and I am sure neither\r\nwill ever return.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be too suspicious,” said Shao. “Chien Yung is clever enough.”\r\n\r\nThat was the end of the interview. Forthwith Yüan-tê sent Sun Chʻien\r\nback to Kuan Yü and then, with Chien Yung, took leave of Yüan Shao and\r\nrode out of the city. As soon as they reached the border line they met\r\nSun Chʻien and all three rode off to Kuan Ting’s farm to meet Kuan Yü.\r\nHe came out to welcome them, bowed and then seized his brother’s hands\r\nwhile tears streamed down his face.\r\n\r\nPresently the two sons of their host came to bow to the visitors. Liu\r\nPei asked their names.\r\n\r\n“These are of the same name as myself,” said Kuan Yü. “The sons are\r\nKuan Ning, who is a student, and Kuan Pʻing, who is to be a soldier.”\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking of sending the younger in your train, General,”\r\nsaid old Kuan, “would you take him?”\r\n\r\n“What is his age?” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“He is eighteen.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei said, “Since, O Senior, you are so kind I venture to suggest\r\nthat your son should be adopted by my brother, who has no son of his\r\nown. What think you of that?”\r\n\r\nKuan Ting was perfectly willing, so he called his younger son and bade\r\nhim make a son’s obeisance to Kuan Yü and to style Yüan-tê, “Uncle.”\r\n\r\nThen it was time to get on their way lest they should be pursued and\r\nwith them went Kuan Pʻing in the train of his “father.” The lad’s real\r\nfather escorted them a short distance and then left. They took the road\r\nto Sleeping Bull Hill. Before they had gone very far they met Chou\r\nTsʻang with a small party. He was wounded. He was introduced to Yüan-tê\r\nwho asked him how it was. He replied, “Before I reached the Hill a\r\ncertain warrior, all alone, had fought with my friend Pʻei and killed\r\nhim. Then many of our men surrendered to him and he occupied our old\r\ncamp. When I reached it I tried to allure the soldiers back to my side\r\nbut only succeeded with a few. The others were too afraid. I got angry\r\nand engaged the interloper, who however worsted me time after time and\r\nwounded me thrice.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the warrior? what does he look like?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“All I know he is a doughty fighter, I do not know his name.”\r\n\r\nThereafter they advanced toward the hill with Kuan Yü in front and\r\nYüan-tê in rear. When they drew near Chou Tsʻang began to abuse his\r\nenemy, who soon appeared, mailed and armed, coming down the hills.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Yüan-tê rode out waving his whip and shouting, “You, O Comer,\r\nare surely Tzŭ-lung?”\r\n\r\nThe rider, for it was Chao Tzŭ-lung, (Chao Yün), instantly slipped out\r\nof the saddle and bowed by the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe brothers dismounted to talk with him and ask how he came to be\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“When I left you I had no idea that Kungsun Tsan was a man who would\r\nlisten to no reason. The result was disaster and he perished in the\r\nflames. Yüan Shao invited me to him several times, but I thought too\r\nlittle of him to go. Then I wanted to go to Hsüchou to you, but you had\r\nlost that place and Yün-chʻang had gone over to Tsʻao Tsʻao and you had\r\njoined Yüan Shao. Several times I thought of coming to you but I feared\r\nYüan Shao. So I drifted from one place to another with nowhere to rest\r\ntill I happened to come this way and Pʻei Yüan-shao tried to steal my\r\nhorse. So I slew him and took possession of his camp. I heard I-tê was\r\nin Kuchʻêng but thought it might be only a rumour. And so the days have\r\npassed till this happy meeting.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê told him all that had happened to him since they parted and so\r\ndid Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nSaid Liu Pʻei, “The first time I saw you I felt drawn to you and did\r\nnot want to part from you. I am very happy to meet you again.”\r\n\r\n“In all my wanderings, trying to find a lord worth serving, I have seen\r\nno one like you. Now I have reached your side that is enough for all my\r\nlife. I care not what may happen to me.”\r\n\r\nNext they burned the camp, after which they all took the road back to\r\nKuchʻêng where they were welcomed. They exchanged the stories of their\r\nseveral adventures and the two ladies related the valiant deeds of Kuan\r\nYü whereat Yüan-tê was too affected to speak.\r\n\r\nThen they performed a great sacrifice to Heaven and Earth with the\r\nslaughter of a bull and a horse.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers also were recompensed for their toils. Yüan-tê surveyed\r\nthe conditions around him and found therein much to rejoice at. His two\r\nbrothers were restored to his side and none of his helpers were\r\nmissing. Moreover he had gained Chao Yün, and his brother Kuan Yü had\r\nacquired an adopted son Pʻing. Another captain had joined his ranks in\r\nthe person of Chou Tsʻang. There was every occasion for feasting and\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Scattered wide were the brothers, none knew another’s retreat,\r\n    Joyfully now they foregather, dragon and tiger meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the forces under the command of the three brothers and\r\ntheir adherents numbered four or five thousand men. Yüan-tê was in\r\nfavour of leaving Kuchʻêng and occupying Junan and just then Liu Pʻei\r\nand Kung Tu, commanders of that city, sent to invite him to go there.\r\nSo they went. There they devoted all their efforts to strengthen their\r\narmy, both horse and foot, but nothing will be said of the recruiting,\r\npurchase of horses and such matters.\r\n\r\nHowever it must be noted that Yüan Shao was much annoyed when Yüan-tê\r\ndid not return and at first was for sending a force after him. However\r\nKuo Tʻu dissuaded him.\r\n\r\n“Liu Pʻei need cause you no anxiety; Tsʻao Tsʻao is your one enemy and\r\nmust be destroyed. Even Liu Piao, though strongly posted on the river,\r\nis none too terrible. There is Sun Po-fu on the east of the river,\r\nstrong, feared, with wide territory, a large army and able counsellors\r\nand leaders; you should make an alliance there against Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nHe won his chief to his view and wrote to Sun, sending the letter by\r\nChʻên Chên.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Just as one warrior leaves the north,\r\n        Another from the east comes forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture chapters will reveal the outcome of these dispositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE “LITTLE CHIEF OF THE FEUDAL LORDS” SLAYS YÜ CHI:\r\nTHE “BLUE-EYED BOY” LAYS HOLD ON CHIANGTUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may tell here how Sun Tsʻê gradually became supreme on the east of\r\nthe river. In the fourth year of the period “Established Peace,” [12]\r\nhe took Luchiang by the defeat of the Prefect Liu Hsün. He despatched\r\nYu Fan with a despatch to the Prefect of Yuchang, [13] Hua Hsin, and he\r\nsurrendered. Thence his renown increased and he boldly sent a memorial\r\non his military successes to the Emperor by the hand of Chang Hung.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao saw in him a powerful rival and said he was a lion\r\ndifficult to contend with. So he betrothed his niece, daughter of Tsʻao\r\nJên, to Sun Kʻuang, the youngest brother of Sun Tsʻê, thus connecting\r\nthe two families by marriage. He also retained Chang Hung near him in\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nThen Sun Tsʻê sought the title of Ta Ssŭ-ma, or Minister of War, one of\r\nthe highest offices of State, but Tsʻao Tsʻao prevented the attainment\r\nof this ambition, and Sun Tsʻê keenly resented it. Henceforward his\r\nthoughts turned toward an attack on Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Prefect of Wuchün sent a secret letter to the\r\ncapital to Tsʻao Tsʻao, saying that Sun Tsʻê was a turbulent fellow of\r\nthe Hsiang Chi type and the government ought, under the appearance of\r\nshowing favour to him, to recall him to the capital for he was a danger\r\nin the provinces. But the bearer of this letter was captured on the\r\nYangtse River and sent to Sun Tsʻê, who immediately put him to death.\r\nThen he treacherously sent to ask the author of the letter, Hsü Kung by\r\nname, to come and consult over some affair. The unsuspecting man came.\r\nSun Tsʻê produced the letter, saying, “So you wish to send me to the\r\nland of the dead, eh?” and thereupon the executioners came in and\r\nstrangled him. The family of the victim scattered, but three of his\r\nclients determined to avenge him if only they could find some means of\r\nattacking Sun.\r\n\r\nTheir chance came in the hunting field. One day Sun went hunting in the\r\nhills to the west of Tantʻu. A stag was started and Sun pressed after\r\nit at topmost speed and followed it deep into the forest. Presently he\r\ncame upon three armed men standing among the trees. Rather surprised to\r\nsee them there he reined in and asked who they were.\r\n\r\n“We belong to Han Tang’s army and are shooting deer,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo Sun Tsʻê shook his bridle to proceed. But just as he did so one of\r\nthe men thrust at him with a spear and wounded his thigh. Sun drew the\r\nsword at his side, dashed forward and cut down the aggressor. The blade\r\nof his sword suddenly fell to the ground, only the hilt remaining in\r\nhis hand. Then one of the assassins drew his bow and an arrow wounded\r\nSun in the cheek. He plucked out the arrow and shot at the offender,\r\nwho fell, but the other two attacked him furiously with their spears,\r\nshouting, “We are Hsü Kung’s men and his avengers!”\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê then understood. But he had no weapons save his bow against\r\nthem. He tried to draw off, keeping them at bay by striking with his\r\nbow, but the fight was getting too much for him and both he and his\r\nsteed were wounded in several places. However, just at the critical\r\nmoment, some of his own men came up and they made short work of the\r\nremaining two avengers.\r\n\r\nBut their lord was in a sorry plight. His face was streaming with blood\r\nand some of the wounds were very severe. They tore up his robe and\r\ntherewith bound up his wounds and they carried him home.\r\n\r\nA poem in praise of the three avengers says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    O Sun Tsʻê was a warrior and a stranger he to fear,\r\n    But he was basely murdered while hunting of the deer.\r\n    Yet were they leal who slew him, to avenge a murdered lord,\r\n    Self immolated like Yü-jang, they dreaded not the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\nBadly wounded, Sun Tsʻê was borne to his home. They sent to call the\r\nfamous physician, Hua Tʻo, but he was far away and could not be found.\r\nHowever, a disciple of his came and the wounded man was committed to\r\nhis care.\r\n\r\n“The arrowheads were poisoned,” said the physician, “and the poison has\r\npenetrated deep. It will take a hundred days of perfect repose before\r\ndanger will be past. But if you give way to passion or anger the wounds\r\nwill not heal.”\r\n\r\nSun’s temperament was hasty and impatient and the prospect of such a\r\nslow recovery was very distasteful. However, he remained quiet for some\r\ntwenty of the hundred days. Then came a messenger from the capital and\r\nhe insisted on seeing and questioning him.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao fears you, my lord, very greatly,” said the messenger,\r\n“and his advisers have exceeding respect for you; all except Kuo Chia.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” asked the sick chieftain.\r\n\r\nThe messenger remained silent, which only irritated his master and\r\ncaused him to demand to be told. So the messenger had to speak the\r\ntruth. He said, “The fact is Kuo Chia told Tsʻao Tsʻao that he need not\r\nfear you, that you were frivolous and unready, impulsive and shallow,\r\njust a stupid swaggerer who would one day come to his death at the\r\nhands of some mean person.”\r\n\r\nThis provoked the sick man beyond endurance.\r\n\r\n“How dare he say this of me, the fool!” cried Sun Tsʻê. “I will take\r\nthe capital from Tsʻao, I swear.”\r\n\r\nIt was no more a question of repose. Ill as he was he wanted to begin\r\npreparations for an expedition at once. They remonstrated with him,\r\nreminded him of the physician’s orders and urged him to rest.\r\n\r\n“You are risking your priceless self in a moment’s anger,” said Chang\r\nChao.\r\n\r\nThen arrived Chʻên Chên, the messenger from Yüan Shao, and Sun would\r\nhave him brought in. He said. “My master wishes to ally himself with Wu\r\nin an attack on Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nSuch a proposal was just after Sun’s heart. At once he called a great\r\nmeeting of his officers in the wall tower and prepared a banquet in\r\nhonour of the messenger. While this was in progress he noticed many of\r\nhis captains whispering to each other and they all began to go down\r\nfrom the banquet chamber. He could not understand this and enquired of\r\nthe attendants near him what it meant. They told him that Saint Yü had\r\njust gone by and the officers had gone down to pay their respects to\r\nhim. Sun Tsʻê rose from his place and went and leaned over the railing\r\nto look at the man. He saw a Taoist priest in snowy garb leaning on his\r\nstaff in the middle of the road, while the crowd about him burnt\r\nincense and made obeisance.\r\n\r\n“What wizard fellow is this? Bring him here!” said Sun.\r\n\r\n“This is Yü Chi,” said the attendants. “He lives in the east and goes\r\nto and fro distributing charms and draughts. He has cured many people\r\nas everybody will tell you, and they say he is a saint. He must not be\r\nprofaned.”\r\n\r\nThis only angered Sun the more and he told them to arrest the man at\r\nonce or disobey at their peril. So there being no help for it they went\r\ndown into the road and hustled the saint up the steps.\r\n\r\n“You madman! How dare you incite men to evil?” said Sun Tsʻê.\r\n\r\n“I am but a poor priest of the Lanyeh Palace. More than half a century\r\nago, when gathering simples in the woods, I found near the Chüyang\r\nSpring a book called “The Way of Peace.” It contains a hundred and more\r\nchapters and taught me how to cure the diseases of men. With this in my\r\npossession I had only one thing to do, to devote myself to spreading\r\nits teachings and saving mankind. I have never taken any thing from the\r\npeople. Can you say I incite men to evil deeds?”\r\n\r\n“You say you take nothing; whence came your clothes and your food? The\r\nfact is you are one of the Yellow Turban kidney and you will work\r\nmischief if you are left alive.” “Take him away and put him to death,”\r\ncontinued he to his attendants.\r\n\r\nChang Chao interceded, “The Taoist has been here in the east these many\r\nyears. He has never done any harm and does not deserve death or\r\npunishment.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I will kill these wizard fellows just as I would cattle.”\r\n\r\nThe officials in a body interceded, even the guest of honour Chʻên\r\nChên, but in vain; Sun Tsʻê refused to be placated. He ordered the\r\nTaoist to be imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe banquet came to an end and the messenger retired to his lodging.\r\nSun Tsʻê also returned to his palace.\r\n\r\nHis treatment of the Taoist Holy Man was the theme of general\r\nconversation and soon reached the ears of his mother. She sent for her\r\nson to the ladies’ apartments and said to him, “They tell me you have\r\nput the Taoist in bonds. He has cured many sick people and the common\r\nfolk hold him in great reverence. Do not harm him.”\r\n\r\n“He is simply a wizard who upsets the multitude with his spells and\r\ncraft. He must be put to death,” replied Tsʻê.\r\n\r\nShe entreated him to stay his hand, but he was obstinate. “Do not heed\r\nthe gossip of the street, mother,” said he. “I must be judge of these\r\nmatters.”\r\n\r\nHowever, he sent to the prison for the Taoist in order to interrogate\r\nhim. Now the gaolers having a great respect for Yü Chi and faith in his\r\npowers were very indulgent to him and did not keep him in the collar.\r\nHowever when Tsʻê sent for him he went with collar and fetters all\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nTsʻê had heard of their indulgence and punished the gaolers so that the\r\nprisoner thereafter lay in constant torture. Chang Chao and some\r\nothers, moved by pity, made a petition which they humbly presented and\r\nthey offered to become surety for him.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê said to them, “Gentlemen, you are all great scholars, but why\r\ndo you not understand reason? Formerly in Chiaochou was a certain\r\nGovernor Chang Ching, who was deluded by these vicious doctrines into\r\nbeating drums, twanging lyres, burning incense and such things. He wore\r\na red turban and represented himself as able to ensure victory to an\r\narmy. But he was slain by the enemy. There is nothing in all this, only\r\nnone of you will see it. I am going to put this fellow to death in\r\norder to stop the spread of this pernicious doctrine.”\r\n\r\nLü Fan interposed, “I know very well this Yü Chi can control the\r\nweather. It is very dry just now, why not make him pray for rain as an\r\namercement?”\r\n\r\n“We will see what sort of witchcraft he is equal to,” said Sun Tsʻê.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he had the prisoner brought in, loosed his fetters and sent\r\nhim up to an altar to intercede for rain.\r\n\r\nThe docile Taoist prepared to do as he was bidden. He first bathed\r\nhimself, then dressed himself in clean garments. After that he bound\r\nhis limbs with a cord and lay down in the fierce heat of the sun. The\r\npeople came in crowds to look on.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “I will pray for three feet of refreshing rain for the benefit\r\nof the people, nevertheless I shall not escape death thereby.”\r\n\r\nThe people said, “But if your prayer be efficacious our lord must\r\nbelieve in your powers.”\r\n\r\n“The day of fate has come for me and there is no escape.”\r\n\r\nPresently Sun Tsʻê came near the altar and announced that if rain had\r\nnot fallen by noon he would burn the priest. And to confirm this he\r\nbade them prepare the pyre.\r\n\r\nAs it neared noon a strong wind sprang up and the clouds gathered from\r\nall quarters. But there was no rain.\r\n\r\n“It is near noon,” said Sun Tsʻê. “Clouds are of no account without\r\nrain. He is only an impostor.”\r\n\r\nHe bade his attendants lay the priest on the pyre and pile wood around\r\nhim and apply the torch. Fanned by the gale the flames rose rapidly.\r\nThen appeared in the sky above a wreath of black vapour followed by\r\nroaring thunder and vivid lightning, peal on peal and flash on flash.\r\nAnd the rain fell in a perfect deluge. In a short time the streets\r\nbecame rivers and torrents. It was indeed a three feet fall.\r\n\r\nYü Chi, who was still lying upon the pile of firewood, cried in a loud\r\nvoice, “O clouds, cease thy rain, and let the glorious sun appear!”\r\n\r\nThereupon officials and people helped the priest down, loosened the\r\ncord that bound him and bowed before him in gratitude for the rain.\r\n\r\nBut Sun Tsʻê boiled with rage at seeing his officers and the people\r\ngathered in groups and kneeling in the water regardless of the damage\r\nto their clothing.\r\n\r\n“Rain or shine are as nature appoints them and the wizard has happened\r\nto hit upon a moment of change; what are you making all this fuss\r\nabout?” cried he.\r\n\r\nThen he drew his sword and told the attendants to smite the Taoist\r\ntherewith. They all besought him to hold his hand.\r\n\r\n“You want to follow Yü Chi in rebellion, I suppose,” cried Sun Tsʻê.\r\n\r\nThe officers, now thoroughly cowed by the rage of their lord, were\r\nsilent and showed no opposition when the executioners seized the\r\nunhappy Taoist and beheaded him.\r\n\r\nThey saw just a wreath of black smoke drift away to the north-east\r\nwhere lay the Langyeh Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was exposed in the market place as a warning to enchanters\r\nand wizards and such people. That night there came a very violent storm\r\nand when it calmed down at daylight there was no trace of the body. The\r\nguards reported this and Sun Tsʻê in his wrath sentenced them to death.\r\nBut as he did so he saw Yü Chi calmly walking toward him as if he were\r\nstill alive. He drew his sword and darted forward to strike at the\r\nwraith, but he fainted and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThey carried him to his chamber and in a short time he recovered\r\nconsciousness. His mother, the Lady Wu, came to visit him and said, “My\r\nson, you have done wrong to slay the holy one and this is your\r\nretribution.”\r\n\r\n“Mother, when I was a boy I went with my father to the wars, where men\r\nare cut down as one cuts hempen stalks. There is not much retribution\r\nabout such doings. I have put this fellow to death and so checked a\r\ngreat evil. Where does retribution come in?”\r\n\r\n“This comes of want of faith,” she replied. “Now you must avert the\r\nevil by meritorious deeds.”\r\n\r\n“My fate depends on Heaven: wizards can do me no harm, so why avert\r\nanything?”\r\n\r\nHis mother saw that it was useless to try persuasion, but she told his\r\nattendants to do some good deeds secretly whereby the evil should be\r\nturned aside.\r\n\r\nThat night about the third watch, as Sun Tsʻê lay in his chamber, he\r\nsuddenly felt a chill breeze, which seemed to extinguish the lamps for\r\na moment, although they soon brightened again, and he saw in the lamp\r\nlight the form of Yü Chi standing near his bed.\r\n\r\nSun said, “I am the sworn foe of witchcraft and I will purge the world\r\nof all such as deal in magic. You are a spirit and how dare you\r\napproach me?”\r\n\r\nReaching down a sword that hung at the head of his bed he hurled it at\r\nthe phantom, which then disappeared. When his mother heard this story\r\nher grief redoubled. Sun Tsʻê, ill as he was, did his utmost to\r\nreassure his mother.\r\n\r\nShe said, “The Holy One says, ‘How abundantly do spiritual beings\r\ndisplay the powers that belong to them!’ and ‘Prayer has been made to\r\nthe spirits of the upper and lower worlds.’ You must have faith. You\r\nsinned in putting Master Yü to death and retribution is sure. I have\r\nalready sent to have sacrifices performed at the Jade-pure Monastery\r\nand you should go in person to pray. May all come right!”\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê could not withstand such a mandate from his mother so,\r\nmustering all his strength, he managed to get into a sedan chair and\r\nwent to the monastery, where the Taoists received him respectfully and\r\nbegged him to light the incense. He did so, but he returned no thanks.\r\nTo the surprise of all, the smoke from the brazier, instead of floating\r\nupwards and dissipating, collected in a mass that gradually shaped\r\nitself into an umbrella and there on the top sat Yü Chi.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê simply spat abuse and went out of the temple. As he passed the\r\ngates, lo! Yü Chi stood there gazing at him with angry eyes.\r\n\r\n“Do you see that wizard fellow?” said he to those about him.\r\n\r\nThey said they saw nothing. More angry than ever he flung his sword at\r\nthe figure by the gate. The sword struck one of his escort who fell.\r\nWhen they turned him over they saw it was the executioner who had\r\nactually slain the Taoist. The sword had penetrated his brain and his\r\nlife drained out through the seven channels of perception. Sun Tsʻê\r\ntold them to bury the man. But as he went out of the courtyard he saw\r\nYü Chi walking in.\r\n\r\n“This temple is nothing more than a lurking place for sorcerers and\r\nwizards and such people,” said he.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he took a seat in front of the building and sent for half a\r\ncompany of soldiers to pull the place down. When they went up on the\r\nroof to strip off the tiles he saw Yü Chi standing on the main beam\r\nflicking tiles to the ground. More angry than ever he told them to\r\ndrive out the priests belonging to the place and burn it. They did so\r\nand when the flames rose their highest he saw the dead Taoist Yü Chi\r\nstanding in the midst of the fire.\r\n\r\nSun Tsʻê returned home still in a bad humour, which increased when he\r\nsaw the form of Yü Chi standing at his gate. He would not enter but\r\nmustered his army and went into camp outside the city walls. And there\r\nhe summoned his officers to meet him and talk over joining Yüan in an\r\nattack on Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThey assembled, but they remonstrated with him and begged him to\r\nconsider his precious health. That night he slept in the camp and again\r\nsaw Yü Chi, this time with his hair hanging loose. He raged at the\r\nvision without cessation.\r\n\r\nNext day his mother called him into the city and he went. She was\r\nshocked at the change in his appearance; he looked so utterly\r\nmiserable. Her tears fell.\r\n\r\n“My son,” said she, “how wasted you are!”\r\n\r\nHe had a mirror brought and looked at himself; he was indeed so gaunt\r\nand thin that he was almost frightened and exclaimed, “How do I come to\r\nlook so haggard?”\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Yü Chi appeared in the mirror. He struck it and\r\nshrieked. Then the half healed wounds re-opened and he fainted.\r\n\r\nHe was raised and borne within. When he recovered consciousness he\r\nsaid, “This is the end; I shall die.”\r\n\r\nHe sent for Chang Chao and his other chief officers and his brother,\r\nSun Chʻüan, and they gathered in his chamber. He gave them his dying\r\ncharge, saying, “In the disordered state of the Empire Wu and Yüeh,\r\nwith their strong defence of the Three Chiang, have a brilliant future.\r\nYou, Chang Chao, must assist my brother.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he handed his seal to Sun Chʻüan saying, “For manipulating\r\nthe might of Chiangtung so as to make it the deciding force between two\r\nfactions and then obtaining the whole Empire you are not so suited as\r\nI; but in encouraging the wise and confiding in the able and getting\r\nthe best out of every one for the preservation of this district, I\r\nshould not succeed as you will. Remember with what toil and labour your\r\nfather and I have won what we possess and take good care thereof.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan wept as he knelt to receive the seal and the dying chief\r\nturned to his mother, “Mother, the days allotted of Heaven have run out\r\nand I can no longer serve my tender mother. I have given over the seal\r\nto my brother and trust that you will advise him early and late, and\r\nsee that he lives worthy of his predecessors.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! your brother is full young for such a task,” said his mother\r\nweeping. “I know not what may happen.”\r\n\r\n“He is far abler than I and fully equal to the task of ruling. Should\r\nhe have doubts upon internal affairs, he must turn to Chang Chao; for\r\nouter matters he must consult Chou Yü. It is a pity Chou Yü is absent\r\nso that I cannot give him my charge face to face.”\r\n\r\nTo his brothers he said, “When I am gone you must help your brother.\r\nShould any discord arise in the family let the others punish the\r\nwrong-doer and let not his ashes mingle with those of his ancestors in\r\nthe family vaults.”\r\n\r\nThe young men wept at these words. Then he called for his wife, the\r\nfamous beauty of the Chʻiao family, and said, “Unhappily we have to\r\npart while still in the full vigour of life. You must care for my\r\nmother. Your sister will come to see you presently and you can ask her\r\nto tell Chou Yü to help my brother in all things and make him keep to\r\nthe way I have taught him to walk in.”\r\n\r\nThen he closed his eyes and soon after passed away. He was only\r\ntwenty-six.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Men called him first of the chieftains,\r\n            The east had felt his might,\r\n        He watched like a tiger crouching,\r\n            Struck as a hawk in flight.\r\n        There was peace in the lands he ruled,\r\n            His fame ran with the wind,\r\n        But he died and left to another,\r\n            The great scheme in his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs his brother breathed his last Sun Chʻüan sank by his bed and wept.\r\n\r\n“This is not the time to mourn,” said Chang Chao. “First see to the\r\nfuneral ceremonies and that the government is safe.”\r\n\r\nSo the new ruler dried his tears. The superintendence of the funeral\r\nwas confided to Sun Ching and then Chang Chao led his young master to\r\nthe hall to receive the felicitations of his officers.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan was endowed with a square jaw and a large mouth; he had blue\r\neyes and a dark brown beard. Formerly, when Liu Yüan had gone to Wu to\r\nvisit the Sun family, he said of the family of brothers, “I have looked\r\nwell at them all and they are all clever and perspicacious, but none of\r\nthem have the very ultimate degree of good fortune. Only the second has\r\nthe look of a deep thinker. His face is remarkable, and his build\r\nunusual, and he has the look of one who will come to great honour. But\r\nnone of them will attain to the blessing of a great age.”\r\n\r\nHistory says that when Sun Chʻüan succeeded to his brother and his\r\nbrother’s might, there was still some reorganization to be done. Soon\r\nChou Yü had arrived. The young ruler received him very graciously and\r\nsaid, “I need have no anxiety now that you have come.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Chou Yü had been sent to hold Pachʻiu. When\r\nhe heard that his chief had been wounded by an arrow he thought it well\r\nto return to see how he was. But Sun Tsʻê had died before Chou Yü could\r\narrive. He hurried to be present at the funeral.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to wail at the coffin of his late chief, Wu Fu-jên, the\r\ndead man’s mother, came out to deliver her son’s last injunctions. When\r\nshe had told him the last charge he bowed to the earth, saying, “I\r\nshall exert the puny powers I have in your service as long as I live.”\r\n\r\nShortly after Sun Chʻüan came in, and, after receiving Chou Yü’s\r\nobeisance, said, “I trust you will not forget my brother’s charge to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nChou bowed saying, “I would willingly suffer any form of death for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“How best can I maintain this grave charge which I have inherited from\r\nmy father and brother?”\r\n\r\n“He who wins men, prospers; he who loses them, fails. Your present plan\r\nshould be to seek men of high aims and farseeing views and you can\r\nestablish yourself firmly.”\r\n\r\n“My brother bade me consult Chang Chao for internal administration, and\r\nyourself on external matters,” said Chʻüan.\r\n\r\n“Chang Chao is wise and understanding and equal to such a task. I am\r\ndevoid of talent and fear to take such responsibility, but I venture to\r\nrecommend to you as a helper one Lu Su, named Tzŭ-ching, a man of\r\nTungchʻuan. This man’s bosom hides strategy and his breast conceals\r\ntactics. He lost his father in early life and has been a perfectly\r\nfilial son to his mother. His family is rich and renowned for charity\r\nto the needy. When I was stationed at Chʻao-chʻang I led some hundreds\r\nof men across the Linhuai. We were short of grain. Hearing that the Lu\r\nfamily had two granaries there, each holding three thousand measures, I\r\nwent to ask for help. Lu Su pointed to one granary and said, ‘Take that\r\nas a gift.’ Such was his generosity!\r\n\r\n“He has always been fond of fencing and horse archery. He was living in\r\nChuo. His grandmother died while he was there and he went to bury her\r\nin Tungchʻêng and then his friend, Liu Tzŭ-yang, wished to engage him\r\nto go to Chʻaohu and join Chêng Pao. However, he hesitated about that\r\nand has not gone yet. You should invite him without loss of time.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan at once sent Chou Yü to engage the services of this man and\r\nhe set out. When the obeisances were over he laid before his friend the\r\ninducements that his own master held out. He replied that as he had\r\nbeen engaged by Liu Tzŭ-yang to go to Chʻaohu he was just starting\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nSaid Chou Yü, “Of old Ma Yüan said to Kuang-Wu, ‘This is an age when\r\nnot only do princes select their ministers, but ministers choose their\r\nprinces.’ Now our General Sun calls to him the wise and treats his\r\nofficers well. Thus he engages the help of the wonderful and gets the\r\nservices of the extraordinary in a way that few others do. But if you\r\nare not engaged elsewhere come with me to Wu as the best thing to do.”\r\n\r\nLu Su returned with him and saw Sun Chʻüan, who treated him with the\r\ngreatest deference and with him discussed affairs very fully. The\r\nconference proved so interesting that it went on all day and neither\r\nfelt fatigue.\r\n\r\nOne day at the close of the usual reception, the chief kept Lu Su to\r\ndine with him. They sat up late and by and by slept on the same couch\r\nas would the closest of friends. In the dead of night Sun Chʻüan said\r\nto his bedfellow, “The Dynasty is failing and everything is at sixes\r\nand sevens. I have received a great charge from my father and brother\r\nand I am thinking of imitating the actions of Huan and Wên and becoming\r\nthe leader of the feudal lords and I pray you instruct me.”\r\n\r\nLu Su replied, “Of old Han Kao-Tsu wished to honour and serve the\r\nEmperor I, but could not on account of Hsiang Yü’s evil doings. Now\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao can be compared with Hsiang Yü; how can you be Huan and\r\nWên? My humble opinion is that the Hans have fallen beyond hope of\r\nrecovery and Tsʻao Tsʻao cannot be destroyed and that the only key to\r\nyour schemes is to secure your present position in order to keep the\r\nmaster hand and control the combinations among the others. Now take\r\nadvantage of the turmoil in the north to smite Huang Tsu and attack Liu\r\nPiao. Thereby you will command the whole length of the Great River\r\n(Yangtse). Then you may style yourself Emperor or King and thereafter\r\nas may be. This was how Kao-Tsu acted.”\r\n\r\nHearing this Sun Chʻüan was very greatly pleased. He threw on some\r\nclothing, got up and thanked his new-found adviser. Next day Sun Chʻüan\r\ngave him costly gifts and sent robes and hangings to his mother.\r\n\r\nLu Su then recommended a friend of his to the young man’s notice, a man\r\nof wide reading and great ability. He was also a filial son. His double\r\nname was Chuko Chin and he came from Nanyang. Sun Chʻüan treated him as\r\na superior guest. This man dissuaded Sun Chʻüan from making common\r\ncause with Yüan Shao, but advised him rather to favour Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nagainst whom he could plan when occasion served. Sun Chʻüan therefore\r\nsent back the messenger Chʻên Chên with despatches that broke off all\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nHearing of Sun Tsʻê’s death, Tsʻao Tsʻao was for sending an expedition\r\nagainst Chiangnan. But a certain historian, Chang Hung, dissuaded him,\r\nsaying that it would be mean to take advantage of the period of\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n“And if you should not overcome him you will make him an enemy instead\r\nof being a friend. It would be preferable to treat him generously.”\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao memorialised the throne and obtained for Sun Chʻüan the title\r\nof Generalissimo and Prefect of Kueichi, while Chang Hung was appointed\r\nunder him as Tu-yu.\r\n\r\nAnd a seal of office was sent him. The new appointment pleased Sun\r\nChʻüan and he was also glad to get Chang Hung back again. He was sent\r\nto act jointly with Chang Chao.\r\n\r\nChang Hung was the means of getting another into Sun Chʻüan’s service.\r\nHis friend was Ku Yung, known also as Yüan-tʻan, a disciple of the\r\nhistorian Tsʻai Yung. He was a man of few words and an abstainer from\r\nwine. He was very correct in all things. Sun Chʻüan employed him in the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nHenceforward Sun Chʻüan’s rule was very prosperous and he waxed\r\nmightily in influence and won the love of all the people.\r\n\r\nWhen Chʻên Chên had returned and related the events in Wu, and told of\r\nthe honours that Tsʻao Tsʻao had obtained for the young man in return\r\nfor his support, Yüan Shao was very wroth and he set about preparing\r\nfor an attack on the capital with a force of seventy legions of\r\nnorthern men.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Although in the south they rest from war,\r\n        They rattle the spears ’neath the northern star.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater it will be seen which side conquered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nYÜAN SHAO DEFEATED AT THE FERRY:\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO BURNS THE WUCHʻAO GRANARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHearing that Yüan Shao was hastening to attack at Kuantu, Hsiahou Tun\r\nwrote to the capital urgently asking for reinforcements, and Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao told off seventy legions with which he marched. Hsün Yü was left\r\nto guard the capital.\r\n\r\nJust as Yüan’s army was starting Tʻien Fêng sent out a remonstrance\r\nfrom his prison cell denouncing the policy of attack and counselling\r\nShao to wait upon such times as Heaven should appoint.\r\n\r\nAn enemy said to Yüan, “Why does this Tʻien Fêng utter ill-omened\r\nwords? My lord is sending forth an army in the cause of humanity and\r\njustice.”\r\n\r\nEasily moved to anger Yüan Shao was going to execute Tʻien, but this\r\ntime he forbore at the entreaties of many of his officers. However, he\r\nwas not appeased, for he said, “I will punish him when I return from\r\nconquering Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he hastened to start. The banners of his host filled the\r\nhorizon, their swords were as trees in the forest. They marched to\r\nYangwu and there made a strong camp.\r\n\r\nThen Chü Shou once more opposed any hasty movement, saying, “Though our\r\nsoldiers are many they are not so bold as the enemy; however, veterans\r\nas are the enemy they have not ample supplies. Therefore they will wish\r\nto force on a speedy battle, while our policy is to hold them off and\r\ndelay. If we can keep from a decisive battle long enough the victory\r\nwill be ours without fighting.”\r\n\r\nThis advice did not appeal to the General. Said he, threateningly,\r\n“Tʻien Fêng spake discouraging words to my armies and I will assuredly\r\nput him to death on my return. How dare you follow in the same way?”\r\n\r\nHe summoned the lictors and sent away the adviser in chains, saying,\r\n“When I have overcome Tsʻao then will I deal with you and Tʻien Fêng\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nThe huge army was camped in four divisions, one toward each point of\r\nthe compass. The camps were ninety li in circuit. Scouts and spies were\r\nsent out to discover the strong and the weak points of the enemy.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s army arrived and were smitten with fear when they heard of the\r\nstrength of their enemy. The leader called together his council. Then\r\nsaid the adviser Hsün Yu, “The enemy are many but not terrible. Ours is\r\nan army of veterans, every man worth ten, but our advantage lies in a\r\nspeedy battle for unhappily our stores are insufficient for a long\r\ncampaign.”\r\n\r\n“You speak to the point,” said Tsʻao. “I think the same.”\r\n\r\nTherefore he issued orders to press forward and force on a battle. Yüan\r\nShao’s men took up the challenge and the two sides were arrayed. On\r\nYüan’s side a legion of crossbow men were placed in ambush on the two\r\nwings, while half a legion of archers held the centre. The signal for\r\ngeneral attack was a bomb and the onset was to continue through three\r\nrolls of the drum.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao wore a silver helmet and breastplate and an embroidered robe\r\nheld in by a jewelled belt. He took up his post in the centre with his\r\nnumerous captains ranged right and left. His banners and ensigns made a\r\nbrave show.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tsʻao army centre opened and the banners moved aside the great\r\ncaptain appeared on horseback with his staff of doughty leaders all\r\nfully armed. Pointing with his whip at Yüan Shao he cried, “In the\r\npresence of the Emperor I pressed your claims to consideration and\r\nobtained for you the title of Generalissimo; why do you now plan\r\nrebellion?”\r\n\r\nYüan replied, “You take the title of a minister of Han, but you are\r\nreally a rebel against the House. Your crimes and evil deeds reach to\r\nthe heavens, and you are worse than the usurper Mang and the rebel Cho.\r\nWhat are these slanderous words about rebellion that dare you address\r\nto me?”\r\n\r\n“I have a command to make you prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“I have the Girdle Decree to arrest rebels,” replied Yüan.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao became wrathful and bade Chang Liao ride forth as his\r\nchampion. From the other side rode Chang Ho on a curvetting steed. The\r\ntwo champions fought four or five bouts with no advantage to either. In\r\nhis heart Tsʻao thought the contest amazing. Then Hsü Chʻu whirled up\r\nhis sword and went to help. To match him rode out Kao Lan with his\r\nspear in rest, and the contestants were now four, battling two and two.\r\nThen Tsʻao ordered three companies under Hsiahou Tun and Tsʻao Hung to\r\nattack the opponents’ array. Thereupon on Yüan’s side the signal for\r\nattack was also given and the legion of crossbow men on the wings shot\r\nand the centre archers let fly all together. The arrows flew all over\r\nthe field in front and Tsʻao’s men could not advance. They hastened\r\naway toward the south. Yüan threw his soldiers on their rear and they\r\nwere broken. They went away toward Kuantu and Yüan advanced another\r\nstage. He camped near them.\r\n\r\nThen Shên Pʻei said, “Now send ten legions to guard Kuantu and get near\r\nTsʻao’s camp, then throw up observation mounds to get a clear view of\r\nthe enemy and choose vantage points whence to shoot arrows into the\r\nmidst of their host. If we can force him to evacuate this place we\r\nshall have gained a strategical point whence Hsüchʻang can be\r\nattacked.”\r\n\r\nYüan adopted this suggestion. From each of the camps they sought out\r\nthe strongest veterans who dug with iron spades and carried earth to\r\nraise mounds near Tsʻao’s camp.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s men saw what their enemies were doing and were anxious to make\r\na sortie and drive them off. But the archers and crossbow men came out\r\ncommanding the narrow throat through which it was necessary to attack\r\nand stayed them. At the end of ten days they had thrown up more than\r\nhalf a hundred mounds and on the summit of each was a lofty tower,\r\nwhence the archers could command their opponents’ camp. Tsʻao’s men\r\nwere greatly frightened and held up their bucklers to keep off the\r\nvarious missiles. From the mounds the arrows flew down, pang! pang!\r\nlike a fierce rain. The men of the Yüan army laughed and jeered when\r\nthey saw their enemies crouching under their shields and crawling on\r\nthe ground to avoid their missiles.\r\n\r\nTsʻao saw that his soldiers were getting out of hand under this attack\r\nso he called a council. Liu Yeh spoke up saying, “Let us make ballistæ\r\nand so destroy them.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao at once had models brought and set cunning workmen to make these\r\nmachines. They soon constructed some hundreds and placed them along the\r\nwalls of the camp inside, just opposite the high ladders on the enemy’s\r\nmounds.\r\n\r\nThen they watched for the archers to ascend the towers. As soon as they\r\nbegan to shoot all the ballistæ began to heave their stone balls into\r\nthe skies and they wrought great havoc. There was no shelter from them\r\nand enormous numbers of the archers were killed. Yüan’s men called\r\nthese machines “Rumblers” and after their appearance the archers dared\r\nnot ascend the mounds to shoot.\r\n\r\nThen Shên Pʻei, the strategist, thought out another plan. He set men to\r\ntunnel under the walls into the midst of Tsʻao’s camp and called this\r\ncorps “The Sappers.” Tsʻao’s men saw the enemy digging out pits behind\r\nthe mounds and told the chief, who at once sought a counter plan from\r\nLiu Yeh.\r\n\r\n“As Yüan Shao can no longer attack openly he is attacking secretly and\r\nis tunnelling a road under ground into the midst of our camp,” said he.\r\n\r\n“But how to meet it?”\r\n\r\n“We can surround the camp with a deep moat which renders their tunnel\r\nuseless.”\r\n\r\nSo a deep moat was dug as quickly as possible and when the enemy\r\nsappers arrived thereat, lo! their labour had been in vain and the sap\r\nwas useless.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that Tsʻao held Kuantu throughout the eighth and ninth\r\nmonths when, the men being worn out and provisions failing, he began to\r\nthink of giving up and returning to the capital. As he could not make\r\nup his mind he referred his difficulties by letter to Hsün Yü, whom he\r\nhad left to guard Hsüchʻang. The reply he got was to this effect:—“I\r\nhave received your command to decide whether to continue the campaign\r\nor retire. It appears to me that Yüan Shao assembled such large forces\r\nat Kuantu with the expectation of winning a decision. You, Sir, are\r\nvery weak while he is very strong and if you cannot get the better of\r\nhim he will be able to work his will on you for this is a crisis of\r\nempire. Your opponents are indeed numerous, but their leader knows not\r\nhow to use them. With your military genius and discernment where are\r\nyou not sure to succeed? Now though your numbers are small it is not as\r\nwhen Chʻu and Han were between Jungyang and Chʻêngkao. You are securely\r\nintrenched with your hands on his throat, and even if you cannot\r\nadvance, that state of things cannot endure for ever but must change.\r\nThis is the time to play some unexpected move and you must not miss it.\r\nThe device I leave to your illustrious ingenuity.”\r\n\r\nThis letter greatly pleased Tsʻao and he urged upon his men to use\r\nevery effort to maintain the position.\r\n\r\nYüan having retired some thirty li, Tsʻao sent out scouts to ascertain\r\nhis new dispositions. One of Hsü Huang’s officers captured an enemy spy\r\nand sent him to his chief, who interrogated him and found out that a\r\nconvoy of supplies was expected and that this spy and others had been\r\nsent to find out what were the risks of the route. Hsü Huang went at\r\nonce to tell Tsʻao. When the adviser Hsün Yu heard that the commander\r\nof the convoy was Han Mêng he said, “That fellow is a valiant fool. A\r\nfew companies of light horse sent to intercept him can capture the\r\nwhole train and cause much trouble in the enemy’s camp.”\r\n\r\n“Whom should I send?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“You might send Hsü Huang; he is capable of such a task.”\r\n\r\nSo Hsü was deputed and he took with him Shih Huan, who had captured the\r\nspy, and his company. And this party was supported by Chang Liao and\r\nHsü Chʻu.\r\n\r\nIt was night when the commissariat train of many thousands of carts\r\ndrew near Yüan Shao’s camp. As they passed through a defile Tsʻao’s men\r\ncame out and stopped the train. Han Mêng galloped up to give battle but\r\nwas soon overcome. The guard was scattered and soon the whole train was\r\nin flames. The escort and their leader got away.\r\n\r\nThe glow of the flames seen from Shao’s camp caused great\r\nconsternation, which became fear when the escaped soldiers rode in and\r\ntold their tale.\r\n\r\nYüan sent out Chang Ho and Kao Lan to try to intercept the raiders and\r\nthey came upon Hsü Huang and his company. Just as they were attacking\r\nreinforcements came up and the Yüan men were between two fires. They\r\nwere cut to pieces and the successful captains rode back to Kuantu,\r\nwhere they were richly rewarded.\r\n\r\nAs an additional safeguard Tsʻao made a supporting outpost in front of\r\nthe main camp to be the apex of a triangle of defence.\r\n\r\nWhen Han Mêng returned with his woeful tidings Yüan Shao was angry and\r\nthreatened to put him to death. His colleagues begged him off.\r\n\r\nThen said Shên Pʻei, “Food is very important for an army in the field\r\nand must be defended with the greatest diligence. Wuchʻao is our main\r\ndepôt and must be carefully guarded.”\r\n\r\n“My plans being complete,” said Shao, “you may as well return to Yehtu\r\nand undertake the control of the supplies. Let there be no shortage.”\r\nSo Shên Pʻei left the army.\r\n\r\nThen a force of two legions under six captains was told off to defend\r\nthe depôt. One of these captains, Shunyu Chʻiung, was a hard man and a\r\nheavy drinker, who in his cups was a terror to the men. Under the idle\r\nlife of guarding the supply depôt the leaders gave themselves up to\r\nindulgence and drank heavily.\r\n\r\nIn Tsʻao’s army also food was getting scarce and a message was sent to\r\nthe capital to send grain quickly. The messenger with the letter,\r\nhowever, had not gone far when he fell into the hands of Shao’s men,\r\nwho took him to the adviser Hsü Yu. Seeing from the letter that Tsʻao\r\nwas short of supplies the adviser went to his master and told him\r\nsaying, “Tsʻao Tsʻao and we have been at grips here for a long time and\r\nthe capital must be undefended. A small army sent quickly could take it\r\nand at the same moment an attack here would deliver Tsʻao into our\r\nhands. Now is the moment to strike, for his supplies are short.”\r\n\r\nShao replied, “Tsʻao is full of ruses and this letter is artfully\r\ndesigned to bring about a battle to suit himself.”\r\n\r\n“If you do not take this chance he will do you some injury by and by.”\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture in came a despatch from Yehchün in which, after\r\nsome details regarding the forwarding of grain, Shên Pʻei said he had\r\ndiscovered that Hsü Yu had been in the habit of receiving bribes while\r\nin Chʻichou and had winked at his relatives collecting excess taxes.\r\nOne son and nephew were then in prison.\r\n\r\nAt this Yüan Shao turned on Hsü Yu angrily and said, “How can you have\r\nthe face to stand before me and propose plans, you extortionate fellow?\r\nYou and Tsʻao Tsʻao have old likings for each other and he has bribed\r\nyou to do his dirty work for him and help his base schemes. Now you\r\nwant to betray my army. I ought to take off your head, but temporarily\r\nI will let your neck carry it away. Get out and never let me see you\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nThe discredited adviser sighed and went out, saying, “Faithful words\r\noffend his ear. He is a pest and unworthy of advice from me. And now\r\nthat Shên Pʻei has injured my son and nephew how can I look my fellow\r\nmen in the face again?”\r\n\r\nAnd he drew his sword to end his life. But his people prevented that.\r\nThey said, “If Yüan Shao rejects your honest words then assuredly he\r\nwill be taken by Tsʻao Tsʻao. You are an old friend of Tsʻao’s; why not\r\nabandon the shade for the sunlight?”\r\n\r\nJust these few words awakened him to consciousness of his position and\r\nhe decided to leave Yüan Shao and go over to Tsʻao Tsʻao for he was an\r\nold friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Vainly now for chances lost\r\n        Yüan sighs; once he was great.\r\n        Had he taken Hsü’s advice,\r\n        Tsʻao had not set up a State.\r\n\r\n\r\nHsü Yu stealthily left the camp and set out for Tsʻao’s lines. He was\r\ncaptured on the way. He told his captors he was an old friend of the\r\nMinister’s and asked them to tell him that Hsü Yu of Nanyang wished to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nThey did so. Tsʻao was resting in his tent, his clothing loose and\r\ncomfortable after the toils of the day. When he heard who wished to see\r\nhim he arose quite joyfully and dressed himself hastily to receive Hsü.\r\nHe went forth to greet him. They saw each other in the distance and\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao clapped his hands with gladness bowing to the ground when\r\nnear enough to his visitor. Hsü Yu hastened to help him rise, saying,\r\n“Sir, you, a great Minister, should not thus salute a simple civilian\r\nlike me.”\r\n\r\n“But you are my old friend and no name or office makes any difference\r\nto us,” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Having been unable to choose the lord I would serve I had to bow my\r\nhead before Yüan Shao. But he was deaf to my words and disregarded my\r\nplans. Wherefore I have left him and come now to see my old friend from\r\nwhom I hope employment.”\r\n\r\n“If Tzŭ-yuan is willing to come then have I indeed a helper,” said\r\nTsʻao. “I desire you to give me a scheme for the destruction of Yüan\r\nShao.”\r\n\r\n“I counselled him to send a light force to take the capital so that\r\nhead and tail be both attacked.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao was alarmed. “If he does so, I am lost.”\r\n\r\n“How much grain have you in store?” said the new adviser.\r\n\r\n“Enough for a year.”\r\n\r\n“I think not quite,” said Yu smiling.\r\n\r\n“Well, half a year.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor shook out his sleeves, rose and hurried toward the door of\r\nthe tent, saying, “I offer him good counsel and he repays me with\r\ndeceit. Could I have expected it?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao held him back. “Do not be angry,” said he. “I will tell you the\r\ntruth. Really I have here only enough for three months.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody says you are a marvel of wickedness and indeed it is true,”\r\nsaid Yu.\r\n\r\n“But who does not know that in war there is no objection to deceit?”\r\nreplied Tsʻao. Then whispering in the other’s ear he said, “Actually\r\nhere I have only supplies for this month’s use.”\r\n\r\n“O do not throw dust in my eyes any more. Your grain is exhausted and I\r\nknow it.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao was startled, for he thought no one knew of the straits he was\r\nin.\r\n\r\n“How did you find that out?” said he.\r\n\r\nHsü Yu produced the letter, saying, “Who wrote that?”\r\n\r\n“Where did you get it?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he told Tsʻao the story of the captured messenger. Tsʻao\r\nseized him by the hand saying, “Since our old friendship has brought\r\nyou to me I hope you have some plan to suggest to me.”\r\n\r\nHsü Yu said, “To oppose a great army with a small one is to walk in the\r\nway of destruction unless you inflict quick defeat. I can propose a\r\nplan which will defeat the innumerable hordes of Yüan Shao without\r\nfighting a battle. But will you follow my advice?”\r\n\r\n“I desire to know your plan,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Your enemy’s stores of all kinds are at Wuchʻao, where the commander\r\nof the guard is that drunkard Shunyu Chʻiung. You can send some of your\r\ntrusty veterans to pretend they belong to Chiang Chi, one of Yüan’s\r\ngenerals, sent to help guard the depôt. These men can find an\r\nopportunity to fire the grain and stores of all kinds, which will upset\r\nall Yüan Shao’s calculations.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao approved. He treated Hsü Yu very liberally and kept him in his\r\ncamp. Forthwith he chose five companies of horse and foot ready for the\r\nexpedition. Chang Liao protested the enterprise would be futile as the\r\ngrain depôt would certainly be well guarded and he suggested treachery\r\non the part of the newly arrived strategist.\r\n\r\n“Hsü Yu is no traitor,” said Tsʻao. “He has come sent by Heaven to\r\ndefeat Yüan Shao. If we do not get grain it will be hard to hold out\r\nand I have either to follow his advice or sit still and be hemmed in.\r\nIf he was a traitor he would hardly remain in my camp. Moreover this\r\nraid has been my desire for a long time. Have no doubts; the raid will\r\ncertainly succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you must look out for an attack here while the camp is\r\nundefended.”\r\n\r\n“That is already well provided for,” said Tsʻao gleefully.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of the camp were then told off. Among them was Hsü Yü.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the raid on the grain depôt were made with extreme\r\ncare to ensure success. When all was ready they set out, Tsʻao himself\r\nin the centre. The army showed the ensigns of their opponents. The men\r\ncarried bundles of grass and faggots to make a blaze. The men were\r\ngagged and the horses tied round the muzzles so as to prevent any\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nThey set out at dusk. The night was fine and the stars shone brightly.\r\nChü Shou, still a prisoner in Yüan Shao’s camp, saw the stars were very\r\nbrilliant and told his gaolers to conduct him out to the central\r\npavilion whence he could study them. While watching he saw the planet\r\nVenus invade the quarter of the Bear and Lyra, which startled him very\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n“Some misfortune is near,” said he.\r\n\r\nSo although it was still night he went to see his master. But Yüan Shao\r\nwas sleeping after indulgence in too much wine and was in bad humour.\r\nHowever, when they had roused him saying that the prisoner had a secret\r\nmessage to deliver, he got up.\r\n\r\n“While I happened to be studying the aspect of the heavens,” said the\r\nnight visitor, “I saw Venus, then between Hydra and Cancer, suddenly\r\nshoot into the neighbourhood of the Bear and Lyra. There is danger of a\r\nrobber raid and special precautions must be taken at the grain depôt.\r\nLose no time in sending good soldiers and vigorous leaders thither and\r\nkeep a lookout on the byeways among the hills that you may escape the\r\nwiles of Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“You are a criminal,” said Shao. “How dare you come with such wild\r\nnonsense to upset my armies.”\r\n\r\nAnd turning to the gaolers he continued, “I bade you confine him; why\r\ndid you let him come?”\r\n\r\nThen he issued orders to put the gaolers to death and appointed others\r\nto keep the prisoner in close custody.\r\n\r\nChü Shou went away, wiping his falling tears and sighing deeply. “Our\r\nsoldiers’ destruction is at hand and I know not where my poor corpse\r\nmay find a resting place.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Blunt truth offended Yüan Shao,\r\n            Too stupid any plan to make,\r\n        His stores destroyed ’tis evident\r\n            That Chʻichou also is at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s raiding party went along through the night. Passing one\r\nof Yüan Shao’s outpost camps they were challenged. Tsʻao sent forward a\r\nman to say, “Chiang Chi has orders to go to Wuchʻao to guard the grain\r\nstores.”\r\n\r\nSeeing that the raiders marched under the ensigns of Yüan Shao the\r\nguard had no suspicions and let them pass. At every post this ruse was\r\neffective and they got safely through.\r\n\r\nThey reached their objective at the end of the fourth watch, the straw\r\nand wood were placed in position without loss of time and the blaze\r\nstarted. Then the captains beat to attack.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the attack Shunyu Chʻiung and his companions were all\r\nasleep after a heavy drinking bout. However, when the alarm was given,\r\nthey sprang up and asked what was the matter. The hubbub was\r\nindescribable. Very soon the fuddled officers were caught with hooks\r\nand hauled out of their camp.\r\n\r\nMu Yüan-chin and Chao Jui were just returning from taking grain to the\r\ncamp and seeing the flames arise, they hastened to assist. Some of\r\nTsʻao’s soldiers ran to tell him that some of the enemy were coming up\r\nin the rear and ask him to send reinforcements, but he only replied by\r\nordering the generals to press on to the front till the enemy was\r\nactually close at hand and then face about. So the attack was pressed\r\nand they all hastened forward.\r\n\r\nVery soon the fire gained strength and thick smoke hung all around\r\nfilling the sky. When Mu and Chao drew near, Tsʻao turned about and\r\nattacked them. They could not stand this for a moment and both captains\r\nwere killed. Finally the stores of grain and forage were utterly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe commander, Shunyu Chʻiung, was made prisoner and taken to Tsʻao who\r\nordered him to be deprived of ears, nose and hands. He was bound on a\r\nhorse and sent, thus horribly mutilated, to his master.\r\n\r\nFrom Yüan’s camp the flames of the burning depôt were seen away in the\r\nnorth and they knew what they meant. Yüan hastily summoned his officers\r\nto a council to send a rescue party. Chang Ho offered to go with Kao\r\nLan but Kuo Tʻu said, “You may not go; it is certain that Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nis there in person, wherefore his camp is undefended. Let loose our\r\nsoldiers on the camp and that will speedily bring Tsʻao back again.\r\nThis is how Sun Pin besieged Wei and thereby rescued Han.”\r\n\r\nBut Chang Ho said, “Not so; Tsʻao is too wily not to have fully\r\nprepared against a chance attack. If we attack his camp and fail and\r\nShunyu Chʻiung should be caught we shall all be captured too.”\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu said, “Tsʻao will be too intent on the destruction of the grain\r\nto think of leaving a guard. I entreat you to attack his camp.”\r\n\r\nSo five companies under Chang Ho and Kao Lan were sent to attack\r\nTsʻao’s camp and Chiang Chi was sent to try to recover the grain store.\r\n\r\nNow after overcoming Shunyu, Tsʻao’s men dressed themselves in the\r\narmour and clothing of the defeated soldiers and put out their emblems,\r\nthus posing as defeated men running back to their own headquarters. And\r\nwhen they happened upon Chiang Chi’s rescue legion they said they had\r\nbeen beaten at Wuchʻao and were retreating. So they were suffered to\r\npass without molestation while Chiang Chi hastened on. But soon he came\r\nto Chang Liao and Hsü Chu who cried out to him to stop. And before he\r\ncould make any opposition Chang Liao had cut him down. Soon his men\r\nwere killed or dispersed and the victors sent false messengers to\r\nShao’s camp to say that Chiang Chi had attacked and driven away the\r\ndefenders of the granaries. So no more reliefs were sent that way.\r\nHowever, reinforcements were sent to Kuantu.\r\n\r\nIn due course the Yüan men came down upon Tsʻao’s camp at Kuantu and\r\nthe defenders at once came out and fought them on three sides so that\r\nthey were worsted. By the time reinforcements arrived Tsʻao’s army,\r\nreturning from the raid, had also come and Yüan’s men were attacked in\r\nthe rear. So they were quite surrounded. However, Chang Ho and Kao Lan\r\nmanaged to force their way out and got away.\r\n\r\nWhen the remains of the defenders of the grain stores reached their\r\nmaster’s camp they were mustered. Seeing the mutilated state of their\r\none time leader, Shao asked how he had come to betray his trust and to\r\nsuffer thus and the soldiers told their lord that their commander had\r\nbeen intoxicated at the time of the attack. So Shunyu was forthwith\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu, fearing lest Chang Ho and Kao Lan would return and testify the\r\nwhole truth, began to intrigue against them. First he went to his lord\r\nsaying, “Those two, Chang and Kao, were certainly very glad when your\r\narmies were defeated.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say this?” asked Yüan.\r\n\r\n“O they have long cherished a desire to go over to Tsʻao Tsʻao, so when\r\nyou sent them on the duty of destroying his camp they did not do their\r\nbest and so brought about this disaster.”\r\n\r\nShao accordingly sent to recall these two to be interrogated as to\r\ntheir faults. But Kuo Tʻu, their enemy, sent a messenger in advance to\r\nwarn them, as though in friendly guise, of the adverse fate that\r\nawaited them. So when the orders reached them to return to answer for\r\ntheir faults they asked why they were recalled. When the messenger\r\ndisclaimed all knowledge of the reasons, Kao Lan drew his sword and\r\nkilled him. Chang Ho was stupefied at this demonstration but Lan said,\r\n“Our lord has allowed some one to malign us and say we have been bought\r\nby Tsʻao Tsʻao. What is the sense in our sitting still and awaiting\r\ndestruction? Rather let us surrender to Tsʻao Tsʻao in reality and save\r\nour lives.”\r\n\r\n“I have been wanting to do this for some time,” replied Chang Ho.\r\n\r\nWherefore both, with their companies, made their way to Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\ncamp to surrender.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived, Hsiahou Tun said to his master, “These two have come\r\nto surrender but I have doubts about them.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “I will meet them generously and win them over even if\r\nthey have treachery in their hearts.”\r\n\r\nThe camp gates were opened to the two officers and they were invited to\r\nenter. They laid down their weapons, removed their armour and bowed to\r\nthe ground before Tsʻao who said, “If Yüan Shao had listened to you he\r\nwould not have suffered defeat. Now you two coming to surrender are\r\nlike Wei Tzŭ going to Yin and Han Hsin going over to Han.”\r\n\r\nHe gave both men the rank of general and the title of marquis, which\r\npleased them much.\r\n\r\nAnd so as Yüan Shao had formerly driven away his adviser, Hsü Yu, so\r\nnow he had alienated two captains and had lost his stores at Wuchʻao\r\nand the army was depressed and down-hearted.\r\n\r\nWhen Hsü Yu advised Tsʻao to attack as promptly as he could the two\r\nnewly surrendered men volunteered to lead the way. So these two were\r\nsent to make a first attack on the camp, and left in the night with\r\nthree divisions. The fighting went on confusedly all night but stayed\r\nat dawn. Shao had lost heavily.\r\n\r\nThen Hsün Yu suggested a plan saying, “Now is the moment to spread a\r\nreport that a party of men will go to take Suantsao and attack Yehchün,\r\nand another to take Liyang and intercept the enemy’s retreat. Yüan\r\nShao, when he hears of this, will be alarmed and tell off his men to\r\nmeet this new turn of affairs, and while he is making these new\r\ndispositions we can have him at great disadvantage.”\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was adopted and care was taken that the report spread\r\nfar around. It came to the ears of Yüan’s soldiers and they repeated it\r\nin camp. Yüan Shao believed it and ordered Yüan Shang with five legions\r\nto rescue Yehchün, and Hsin Ming with another five to go to Liyang and\r\nthey marched away at once. Tsʻao heard that these armies had started\r\nand at once despatched eight divisions to make a simultaneous attack on\r\nthe nearly empty camp. Yüan Shao’s men were too dispirited to fight and\r\ngave way on all sides.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao without waiting to don his armour went forth in simple dress\r\nwith an ordinary cap upon his head and mounted his steed. His son Shang\r\nfollowed him. Four of the enemy captains with their men pressed in his\r\nrear and Shao hastened across the river, abandoning all his documents\r\nand papers, baggage, treasure and stores. Only eight hundred men\r\nfollowed him over the stream. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s men followed hard but could\r\nnot come up with him; however, they captured all his impedimenta and\r\nthey slew many thousands of his men so that the watercourses ran blood\r\nand the drowned corpses could not be counted. It was a most complete\r\nvictory for Tsʻao and he made over all the spoil to the army.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers of Yüan Shao was found a bundle of letters showing\r\nsecret correspondence between him and many persons in the capital and\r\narmy. Tsʻao’s personal staff suggested that the names of those\r\nconcerned should be abstracted and the persons arrested, but their lord\r\nsaid, “Shao was so strong that even I could not be sure of safety; how\r\nmuch less other men?”\r\n\r\nSo he ordered the papers to be burned and nothing more was said.\r\n\r\nNow when Yüan Shao’s men ran away Chü Shou, being a prisoner, could not\r\nget away and was captured. Taken before Tsʻao, who knew him, he cried\r\naloud, “I will not surrender.”\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao, “Yüan Shao was foolish and neglected your advice; why still\r\ncling to the path of delusion? Had I had you to help me I should have\r\nbeen sure of the Empire.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was well treated in the camp but he stole a horse and\r\ntried to get away to Yüan Shao. This angered Tsʻao who put him to\r\ndeath, which he met with brave composure.\r\n\r\n“I have slain a faithful and righteous man,” then said Tsʻao sadly. And\r\nthe victim was honourably buried at Kuantu. His tomb bore the\r\ninscription “This is the tomb of Chü the loyal and virtuous.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Chü honest was and virtuous,\r\n        The best in Yüan’s train,\r\n        From him the stars no secrets held,\r\n        In tactics all was plain.\r\n        For him no terrors had grim death,\r\n        Too lofty was his spirit,\r\n        His captor slew him, but his tomb\r\n        Bears witness to his merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao now gave orders to attack Chʻichou.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In feeling over confident, that’s where one’s weakness lay;\r\n    The other bettered him by plans which never went agley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following chapter will tell who won the next campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO OVERCOMES YÜAN SHAO:\r\nLIU PEI SEEKS SHELTER WITH LIU PIAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao lost no time in taking advantage of Yüan Shao’s flight, but smote\r\nhard at the retreating men. Yüan Shao without helmet or proper dress,\r\nand with few followers, crossed hastily to the north bank at Liyang. He\r\nwas met by his General, Chiang I-chu, who took him in and comforted him\r\nand listened to the tale of misfortunes. Next Chiang called in the\r\nscattered remnants of the army, and when the soldiers heard that their\r\nold lord was alive they swarmed to him like ants so that he quickly\r\nbecame strong enough to attempt the march to Chʻichou. Soon the army\r\nset out and at night halted at Huang Hills.\r\n\r\nThat evening, sitting in his tent, Shao seemed to hear a far off sound\r\nof lamentation. He crept out quietly to listen and found it was his own\r\nsoldiers telling each other tales of woe. This one lamented an elder\r\nbrother lost, that one grieved for his younger brother abandoned; a\r\nthird mourned a companion missing, a fourth, a relative cut off. And\r\neach beat his breast and wept. And all said, “Had he but listened to\r\nTʻien Fêng we had not met this disaster.”\r\n\r\nAnd Yüan Shao, very remorseful, said, “I did not hearken unto Tʻien\r\nFêng and now my men have been beaten and I was nearly lost. How can I\r\nreturn and look him in the face?”\r\n\r\nNext day the march was resumed and he met Fêng Chi with reinforcements,\r\nto whom he said, “I disregarded Tʻien Fêng’s advice and have brought\r\nmyself to defeat. Now shall I be greatly ashamed to look him in the\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nThis tribute to Tʻien Fêng’s prescience roused the jealousy of Fêng\r\nChi, who replied, “Yes; when he heard the news of your defeat, though\r\nhe was a prisoner, he clapped his hands for joy and said, ‘Indeed, just\r\nas I foretold!’”\r\n\r\n“How dare he laugh at me, the blockhead? Assuredly he shall die,” said\r\nYüan.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he wrote a letter and sent therewith a sword to slay the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tʻien’s gaoler came to him one day saying, “Above all men I\r\nfelicitate you.”\r\n\r\n“What is the joyful occasion and why felicitate?” said Tʻien Fêng.\r\n\r\nThe gaoler replied, “General Yüan has been defeated and is on his way\r\nback; he will treat you with redoubled respect.”\r\n\r\n“Now am I a dead man,” said Tien.\r\n\r\n“Why say you that, Sir, when all men give you joy?”\r\n\r\n“The General appears liberal but he is jealous and forgetful of honest\r\nadvice. Had he been victorious he might have pardoned me; now that he\r\nhas been defeated and put to shame I may not hope to live.”\r\n\r\nBut the gaoler did not believe him. Before long came the letter and the\r\nsword with the fatal order. The gaoler was dismayed, but the victim\r\nsaid, “I knew all too well that I should have to die.”\r\n\r\nThe gaoler wept. Tʻien Fêng said, “An able man born into this world who\r\ndoes not recognise and serve his true lord is ignorant. To-day I die,\r\nbut I am not deserving of pity.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he committed suicide in the prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Chü Shou but yesterday was killed,\r\n        Tʻien ends his life his fate fulfilled;\r\n        Hopei’s main beams break one by one,\r\n        Mourn ye that House! its day is done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus died Tʻien Fêng, pitied of all who heard of his fate. When Yüan\r\nShao came home it was with troubled mind and distorted thoughts. He\r\ncould not attend to the business of government and became so ill that\r\nhis wife, who came of the Liu family, besought him to make his last\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nNow three sons had been born to him, Tʻan the eldest, who was commander\r\nat Chʻingchou; Hsi, who ruled over Yuchou; and Shang, borne to him by\r\nhis second wife, who still lived. This youngest son was very handsome\r\nand noble looking, and his father’s favourite. So he was kept at home.\r\nAfter the defeat at Kuantu the lad’s mother was constantly urging that\r\nher son should be named as successor and Shao called together four of\r\nhis counsellors to consider this matter. These four happened to be\r\ndivided in their sympathies, Shên Pʻei and Fêng Chi being in favour of\r\nthe youngest son, and Hsin Pʻing and Kuo Tʻu supporters of the eldest.\r\n\r\nWhen they met to consult, Yüan Shao said, “As there is nought but war\r\nand trouble outside our borders it is necessary that tranquillity\r\nwithin be early provided for and I wish to appoint my successor. My\r\neldest son is hard and cruel, my second is mild and unfit. The third\r\nhas the outward form of a hero, appreciates the wise and is courteous\r\nto his subordinates. I wish him to succeed, but I would that you tell\r\nme your opinions.”\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu said, “Tʻan is your first born and he is in a position of\r\nauthority beyond your control. If you pass over the eldest in favour of\r\nthe youngest you sow the seeds of turbulence. The prestige of the army\r\nhas been somewhat lowered and enemies are on our border. Should you add\r\nto our weakness by making strife between father and son, elder and\r\nyounger brothers? Rather consider how the enemy may be repulsed and\r\nturn to the question of the heirship later.”\r\n\r\nThen the natural hesitation of Yüan Shao asserted itself and he could\r\nnot make up his mind. Soon came news that his sons, Tʻan and Hsi, and\r\nhis nephew, Kao Kan, were coming with large armies to help him and he\r\nturned his attention to preparations for fighting Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao drew up his victorious army on the banks of the Yellow\r\nRiver a certain aged native brought an offering of food and sauce to\r\nbid him welcome. His venerable and hoary appearance led Tsʻao to treat\r\nhim with the highest respect and he invited him to be seated and said\r\nto him, “Venerable Sir, what may be your age?”\r\n\r\n“I am nearly a hundred,” replied the ancient.\r\n\r\n“I should be very sorry if my men had disturbed your village,” said\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\n“In the days of the Emperor Huan a yellow star was seen over by way of\r\nChʻu and Sung in the southwest. A certain man of Liaotung, Yin Kʻuei,\r\nwho was learned in astrology, happened to be passing the night here and\r\nhe told us that the star foretold the arrival in these parts, fifty\r\nyears hence, of a true and honest man from Lian and Pʻei. Lo! that is\r\nexactly fifty years ago. Now Yüan Pên-chʻu is very hard on the people\r\nand they hate him. You, Sir, having raised this army in the cause of\r\nhumanity and righteousness, out of pity for the people and to punish\r\ncrimes, and having destroyed the hordes of Yüan Shao at Kuantu, just\r\nfulfil the prophecy of Yin Kʻuei and the millions of the land may look\r\nnow for tranquillity.”\r\n\r\n“How dare I presume that I am he?” said Tsʻao with a smile.\r\n\r\nWine was served and refreshments brought in and the old gentleman was\r\nsent away with presents of silk stuffs. And an order was issued to the\r\narmy that if any one killed so much as a fowl or a dog belonging to the\r\nvillagers he should be punished as for murder. And the soldiers obeyed\r\nwith fear and trembling while Tsʻao rejoiced in his heart.\r\n\r\nIt was told Tsʻao that the total army from the four prefectures under\r\nthe Yüan family amounted to twenty-three legions and they were camped\r\nat Tsʻang-tʻing. Tsʻao then advanced nearer them and made a strong\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nSoon after the two armies were arrayed over against each other. On one\r\nside Tsʻao rode to the front surrounded by his captains, and on the\r\nother appeared Yüan Shao supported by his three sons, his nephew and\r\nhis officers.\r\n\r\nTsʻao spoke first, “Pên-chʻu, your schemes are poor, your strength is\r\nexhausted, why still refuse to think of surrender? Are you waiting till\r\nthe sword shall be upon your neck? Then it will be too late.”\r\n\r\nYüan Shao turned to those about him saying, “Who dares go out?”\r\n\r\nHis son Shang was anxious to exhibit his prowess in the presence of his\r\nfather so he flourished his pair of swords and rode forth. Tsʻao\r\npointed him out to his officers and asked if any one knew him and they\r\nreplied that he was the youngest son. Before they had finished speaking\r\nfrom their own side rode out one Shih Huan, armed with a spear. The two\r\nchampions fought a little while and suddenly Shang whipped up his\r\nhorse, made a feint and fled. His opponent followed. Yüan Shang took\r\nhis bow, fitted an arrow, turned in his saddle and shot at Shih Huan,\r\nwounding him in the left eye. He fell from the saddle and died on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao seeing his son thus get the better of his opponent, gave the\r\nsignal for attack and the whole army thundered forward. The onslaught\r\nwas heavy, but presently the gongs on both sides sounded the retire and\r\nthe battle ceased.\r\n\r\nWhen he had returned to camp Tsʻao took counsel to find a plan to\r\novercome Yüan Shao. Then Chʻêng Yü proposed the plan of the Ten\r\nAmbushes and persuaded Tsʻao to retire upon the river, placing men in\r\nambush as he went. Thus would Shao be inveigled into pursuit as far as\r\nthe river, when Tsʻao’s men would be forced to make a desperate stand\r\nor be driven into the water.\r\n\r\nTsʻao accepted this suggestion and told off five companies to lie in\r\nambush on one side of the road of retreat and five on the other, while\r\nHsü Chu commanded the advanced front.\r\n\r\nNext day the ten companies started first and placed themselves right\r\nand left as ordered. In the night Tsʻao ordered the advanced front to\r\nfeign an attack on the camp, which roused all the enemy in all their\r\ncamps. This done Hsü Chu retreated and the Shao army came in pursuit.\r\nThe roar of battle went on without cessation and at dawn Tsʻao’s army\r\nrested on the river and could retreat no farther. Then Tsʻao shouted,\r\n“There is no road in front, so all must fight to the death.”\r\n\r\nThe retreating army turned about and advanced vigorously. Hsü Chu\r\nsimply flew to the front, smote and killed a half score captains and\r\nthrew Yüan Shao’s army into confusion. They tried to turn and march\r\nback, but Tsʻao Tsʻao was close behind. Then the drums of the enemy\r\nwere heard and right and left there appeared a company, one pair of the\r\nambushed parties. Yüan Shao collected about him his three sons and his\r\nnephew and they were enabled to cut their way out and flee. Ten li\r\nfurther on they fell into another ambush and here many men were lost so\r\nthat their corpses lay over the country-side and the blood filled the\r\nwater courses. Another ten li and they met the third pair of companies\r\nbarring their road.\r\n\r\nHere they lost heart and bolted for an old camp of their own that was\r\nnear, and bade their men prepare a meal. But just as the food was ready\r\nto eat down came Chang Liao and Chang Ho and burst into the camp.\r\n\r\nYüan Shao mounted and fled as far as Tsʻang-tʻing, when he was tired\r\nand his steed spent. But there was no rest, for Tsʻao came in close\r\npursuit. It seemed now a race for life. But presently Shao found his\r\nonward course again blocked and he groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n“If we do not make most desperate efforts we are all captives,” said\r\nhe, and they plunged forward. His second son and his nephew were\r\nwounded by arrows and most of his men were dead or had disappeared. He\r\ngathered his sons into his arms and wept bitterly. Then he fell into a\r\nswoon. He was picked up, but his mouth was full of blood which ran\r\nforth in a bright scarlet stream. He sighed saying, “Many battles have\r\nI fought and little did I think to be driven to this. Heaven is\r\nafflicting me. You had better return each to his own and swear to fight\r\nthis Tsʻao to the end.”\r\n\r\nThen he bade Hsin Pʻing and Kuo Tʻu as quickly as possible follow Yüan\r\nTʻan to his district and prepare to give battle to the enemy lest he\r\nshould invade. Yüan Hsi was told to go to Yuchou and Kao Kan to\r\nPingchou.\r\n\r\nSo each started to prepare men and horses for repulsing Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\nYüan Shao with his youngest son and the remnant of his officers went\r\naway to Chʻichou and military operations were suspended for a time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tsʻao Tsʻao was distributing rewards to his army for the late\r\nvictory and his men were scouting all about Chʻichou. He soon learned\r\nthat Yüan Shao was ill and that his youngest son and Shên Pʻei were in\r\ncommand of the city, while his brothers and cousin had returned each to\r\nhis own. Tsʻao’s advisers were in favour of a speedy attack. But he\r\nobjected, saying “Chʻichou is large and well supplied; Shên Pʻei is an\r\nable strategist and it behoves me to be careful. I would rather wait\r\ntill the autumn when the crops have been gathered in so that the people\r\nwill not suffer.”\r\n\r\nWhile the attack was being talked over there came letters from Hsün Yu\r\nsaying that Liu Pei was strengthening himself at Junan and, when he had\r\nheard that Tsʻao was going to attack Chʻichou, he had said he would\r\ntake the opportunity to march on the capital. Wherefore the Minister\r\nwould do well to hasten homeward to defend it. This news disconcerted\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao. He left Tsʻao Hung in command on the river bank, with\r\norders to maintain the appearance of strength there, while he led the\r\nmain part of his army to meet the threatened attack from Junan.\r\n\r\nIt has to be said now that Liu Pei, his brothers and supporters, having\r\ngone forth with the intention of attacking the capital, had reached a\r\npoint near Jang Hills when Tsʻao came upon them. So Liu Pei camped by\r\nthe hills and divided his army into three, sending his brothers with\r\none division each to entrench themselves south-east and south-west\r\nrespectively of the main body which he and Chao Yün commanded.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao came near, Yüan-tê beat his drums and went out to where\r\nTsʻao had already arrayed his men. Tsʻao called Liu Pei to a parley,\r\nand when the latter appeared under his great standard, Tsʻao pointed\r\nhis whip at him and railed saying, “I treated you as a guest of the\r\nhighest consideration; why then do you turn your back on righteousness\r\nand forget kindness?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “Under the name of Minister you are really a rebel. I\r\nam a direct descendant of the family and I have a secret decree from\r\nthe throne to take such offenders as you.”\r\n\r\nAs he said these words he produced and recited the decree which is\r\nknown as the “Girdle Mandate.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao grew very angry and ordered Hsü Chʻu to go out to battle, and, as\r\nLiu Pei’s champion, out rode Chao Yün with spear ready to thrust. The\r\ntwo warriors exchanged thirty bouts without advantage to either. Then\r\nthere arose an earth-rending shout and up came the two brothers,\r\nYün-chʻang from the south-east and Fei from the south-west. The three\r\narmies then began a great attack, which proved too much for Tsʻao’s\r\nmen, fatigued by a long march, and they were worsted and fled. Yüan-tê\r\nhaving scored this victory returned to camp.\r\n\r\nNext day he sent out Chao Yün again to challenge the enemy, but it was\r\nnot accepted and Tsʻao’s army remained ten days without movement. Then\r\nChang Fei offered a challenge which also was not accepted. And Yüan-tê\r\nbegan to feel anxious.\r\n\r\nThen unexpectedly came news that the enemy had stopped a train of\r\nsupplies and at once Chang Fei went to the rescue. Worse still was the\r\nnews that followed, that an army had got in behind to attack Junan.\r\n\r\nQuite dismayed, Yüan-tê said, “If this be true I have enemies in front\r\nand rear and have no place to go.”\r\n\r\nHe then sent Yün-chʻang to try to recover the city and thus both his\r\nbrothers were absent from his side. One day later a horseman rode up to\r\nsay Junan had fallen, its defender Liu Pʻi was a fugitive and\r\nYün-chʻang surrounded. To make matters worse the news came that Chang\r\nFei, who had gone to rescue Kung Tu, was in like case.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê tried to withdraw his men, fearing all the time an attack from\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao. Suddenly the sentinels came in saying Hsü Chʻu was at the\r\ncamp gate offering a challenge, but no one dared accept it or go out.\r\nThey waited till dawn, and then Yüan-tê bade the soldiers get a good\r\nmeal and be ready to start. When ready the foot went out first, the\r\nhorsemen next, leaving a few men in the camp to beat the watches and\r\nmaintain an appearance of occupation.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling a short distance they passed some mounds. Suddenly\r\ntorches blazed out and on the summit stood one who shouted, “Do not let\r\nLiu Pei run away; I, the Minister, am here awaiting him.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei dashed along the first clear road he saw.\r\n\r\nChao Yün said, “Fear not, my lord, only follow me,” and setting his\r\nspear he galloped in front opening a lane as he went. Yüan-tê gripped\r\nhis double sword and followed close. As they were winning through, Hsü\r\nChʻu came in pursuit and engaged Chao Yün, and two other companies bore\r\ndown as well. Seeing the situation so desperate Yüan-tê plunged into\r\nthe wilds and fled. Gradually the sounds of battle became fainter and\r\ndied away while he went deeper and deeper into the hills, a single\r\nhorseman fleeing for his life. He kept on his way till daybreak, when a\r\ncompany suddenly appeared beside the road. Yüan-tê saw these men with\r\nterror at first, but was presently relieved to find they were led by\r\nthe friendly Liu Pʻi. They were a company of his defeated men escorting\r\nthe family of their chief. With them also were Sun Chʻien, Chien Yung\r\nand Mi Fang.\r\n\r\nThey told him that the attack on their city had been too strong to be\r\nresisted and so they had been compelled to abandon the defence, that\r\nthe enemy had followed them and only Kuan’s timely arrival had saved\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I do not know where my brother is,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“All will come right if you will push on,” said Liu Pʻi.\r\n\r\nThey pushed on. Before they had gone far the beating of drums was heard\r\nand suddenly appeared Chang Ho with a company of soldiers. He cried,\r\n“Liu Pei, quickly dismount and surrender.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was about to retire when he saw a red flag waving from a\r\nrampart on the hills and down came rushing another body of men under\r\nKao Lan. Thus checked in front and his retreat cut off, Yüan-tê looked\r\nup to Heaven and cried, “O Heaven, why am I brought to this state of\r\nmisery? Nothing is left me now but death.” And he drew his sword to\r\nslay himself.\r\n\r\nBut Liu Pʻi stayed his hand saying, “Let me try to fight a way out and\r\nsave you.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Kao Lan’s force was on the point of engaging his. The two\r\nleaders met and in the third bout Liu Pʻi was cut down. Liu Pei at once\r\nrushed up to fight, but just then there was sudden confusion in the\r\nrear ranks of the opponents and a warrior dashed up and thrust at Kao\r\nLan with his spear. Kao Lan fell from his steed. The newcomer was Chao\r\nYün.\r\n\r\nHis arrival was most opportune. He urged forward his steed thrusting\r\nright and left, and the enemy’s ranks broke and scattered. Then the\r\nfirst force under Chang Ho came into the fight and the leader and Chao\r\nYün fought thirty or more bouts. However, this proved enough, for Ho\r\nturned his horse away recognising that he was worsted. Yün vigorously\r\nattacked, but was forced into a narrow space in the hills where he was\r\nhemmed in. While seeking for some outlet they saw Yün-chʻang, Kuan\r\nPʻing and Chou Tsʻang, with three hundred men, coming along. Soon Chang\r\nHo was driven off and then they came out of the narrow defile and\r\noccupied a strong position among the hills where they made a camp.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê sent Yün-chʻang for news of the missing brother, Chang Fei. He\r\nhad been attacked by Hsiahou Yüan, but had vigorously resisted, beaten\r\nhim off and followed him up. Then Yo Chin had come along and surrounded\r\nChang Fei. In this pass he was found by Yün-chʻang, who had heard of\r\nhis plight from some of his scattered men met on the way. Now they\r\ndrove off the enemy. The two brothers returned. Soon they heard of the\r\napproach of a large body of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army. Yüan-tê then bade Sun\r\nChʻien guard his family and sent him on ahead, while he and the others\r\nkept off the enemy, sometimes giving battle and anon marching. Seeing\r\nthat Yüan-tê was retiring, Tsʻao Tsʻao let him go and left the pursuit.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê collected his men he found they numbered only a thousand,\r\nand this halting and broken force marched as fast as possible to the\r\nwest. Coming to a river they asked the natives its name and were told\r\nit was the Han, and near it Yüan-tê made a temporary camp. When the\r\nlocal people found out who was in the camp they presented flesh and\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nA feast was given upon a sandy bank of the Han. After they had drunk\r\nawhile, Yüan-tê addressed his faithful followers, saying, “All you,\r\nfair Sirs, have talents fitting you to be advisers to a monarch, but\r\nyour destiny has led you to follow poor me. My fate is distressful and\r\nfull of misery. To-day I have not a spot to call my own and I am indeed\r\nleading you astray. Therefore I say you should abandon me and go to\r\nsome illustrious lord where you may be able to become famous.”\r\n\r\nAt these words they all covered their faces and wept. Yün-chʻang said,\r\n“Brother, you are wrong to speak thus. When the great Founder of Han\r\ncontended with Hsiang Yü he was defeated many times, but he won at\r\nChiuli Hill and that achievement was the foundation of a Dynasty that\r\nendured for four centuries. Victory and defeat are but ordinary events\r\nin a soldier’s career and why should you give up?”\r\n\r\n“Success and failure both have their seasons,” said Sun Chʻien, “and we\r\nare not to grieve. Chingchou, which your illustrious relative, Liu\r\nPiao, commands, is a rich and prosperous country. Liu Piao is of your\r\nhouse, why not go to him?”\r\n\r\n“Only that I fear he may not receive me,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Then let me go and prepare the way. I will make Liu Ching-hsing come\r\nout to his borders to welcome you.”\r\n\r\nSo with his lord’s approval Sun Chʻien set off immediately and hastened\r\nto Chingchou. When the genuflexions and ceremonies of greeting were\r\nover Liu Piao asked the reason of the visit.\r\n\r\nSaid Sun, “The Princely Liu is one of the heroes of the day although\r\njust at the moment he may lack soldiers and leaders. His mind is set\r\nupon restoring the Dynasty to its pristine glory, and at Junan the two\r\ncommanders, Liu and Kung, though bound to him by no ties, were content\r\nto die for the sake of his ideals. You, illustrious Sir, like Liu Pei,\r\nare a scion of the Imperial stock. Now the Princely One has recently\r\nsuffered defeat and thinks of seeking a home in the east with Sun\r\nChung-mou (Sun Chʻüan). I have ventured to dissuade him, saying that he\r\nshould not turn from a relative and go to a mere acquaintance; telling\r\nhim that you, Sir, are well known as courteous to the wise and\r\ncondescending to scholars, so that they flock to you as the waters flow\r\nto the east, and that certainly you would show kindness to one of the\r\nsame ancestry. Wherefore he has sent me to explain matters and request\r\nyour commands.”\r\n\r\n“He is my brother,” said Piao, “and I have long desired to see him, but\r\nno opportunity has occurred. I should be very happy if he would come.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao, who was sitting by, here broke in with “No, no! Liu Pei\r\nfirst followed Lü Pu, then he served Tsʻao Tsʻao, and next he joined\r\nhimself to Yüan Shao. And he stayed with none of these, so that you can\r\nsee what manner of man he is. If he come here Tsʻao Tsʻao will\r\nassuredly come against us and fight. Better cut off this messenger’s\r\nhead and send it as an offering to Tsʻao Tsʻao, who would reward you\r\nwell for the service.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien sat unmoved while this harangue was pronounced, saying at\r\nthe end, “I am not afraid of death. Liu, the Princely One, is true and\r\nloyal to the State and so out of sympathy with Lü Pu, or Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nor Yüan Shao. It is true he followed these three, but there was no help\r\nfor it. Now he knows your chief is a member of the family, so that both\r\nare of the same ancestry, and that is why he has come far to join him.\r\nHow can you slander a good man like that?”\r\n\r\nLiu Piao bade Tsʻao Mao be silent and said, “I have decided and you\r\nneed say no more.”\r\n\r\nWhereat Tsʻai Mao sulkily left the audience chamber.\r\n\r\nThen Sun Chʻien was told to return with the news that Yüan-tê would be\r\nwelcome and Prefect Liu Piao went thirty li beyond his boundaries to\r\nmeet his guest. When Yüan-tê arrived he behaved to his host with the\r\nutmost politeness and was warmly welcomed in return. Then Liu Pei\r\nintroduced his two sworn-brothers and friends and they entered\r\nChingchou, where Liu Pei finally was lodged in the Prefect’s own\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Tsʻao Tsʻao knew whither his enemy had gone he wished to\r\nattack Liu Piao, but Chʻêng Yü advised against any attempt so long as\r\nYüan Shao, the dangerous enemy, was left with power to inflict damage.\r\nHe advised return to the capital to refresh the men so that they might\r\nbe ready for a campaign in the mild spring weather.\r\n\r\nTsʻao accepted his advice and set out for the capital. In the first\r\nmonth of the eighth year of the period “Established Tranquillity,”\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao once again began to think of war, and sent to garrison\r\nJunan as a precaution against Liu Piao. Then, after arranging for the\r\nsafety of the capital, he marched a large army to Kuantu, the camp of\r\nthe year before.\r\n\r\nAs to Yüan Shao, who had been suffering from blood-spitting but was now\r\nin better health, he began to think of measures against Hsütu, but Shên\r\nPʻei dissuaded him saying, “You are not yet recovered from the fatigues\r\nof last year. It would be better to make your position impregnable and\r\nset to improving the army.”\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Tsʻao’s approach arrived, Yüan said, “If we allow the\r\nfoe to get close to the city before we march to the river we shall have\r\nmissed our opportunity. I must go out to repel this army.”\r\n\r\nHere his son interposed, “Father, you are not sufficiently recovered\r\nfor a campaign and should not go so far. Let me lead the army against\r\nthis enemy.”\r\n\r\nYüan consented, and he sent to Chʻingchou and Yuchou and Pingchou to\r\ncall upon his other two sons and his nephew to attack Tsʻao Tsʻao at\r\nthe same time as his own army.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Against Junan they beat the drum,\r\n        And from Chʻichou the armies come.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whom the victory will be seen in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nCHʻICHOU TAKEN: YÜAN SHANG STRIVES:\r\nTHE CHANG RIVER CUT: HSÜ YU’S SCHEME.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan Shang was puffed up with pride after his victory over Shih Huan\r\nand, without deigning to wait the arrival of his brothers, he marched\r\nout to Liyang to meet the army of Tsʻao Tsʻao. Chang Liao came out to\r\nchallenge him, and Yüan Shang, accepting the challenge rode out with\r\nspear set. But he only lasted to the third bout when he had to give\r\nway. Chang Liao smote with full force and Shang, quite broken, fled\r\npell mell to Chʻichou. His defeat was a heavy shock to his father, who\r\nhad a severe fit of hemorrhage at the news and swooned.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Liu, his wife, got him to bed as quickly as possible, but he\r\ndid not rally and she soon saw it was necessary to prepare for the end.\r\nSo she sent for Shên Pʻei and Fêng Chi that the succession might be\r\nsettled. They came and stood by the sick man’s bed, but by this time he\r\ncould no longer speak; he only made motions with his hands. When his\r\nwife put the formal question, whether Shang was to succeed, he nodded\r\nhis head. Shên Pʻei at the bedside wrote out the dying man’s testament.\r\nPresently he uttered a loud moan, a fresh fit of bleeding followed and\r\nhe passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Born of a line of nobles famous for generations,\r\n    He himself in his youth was wayward always and headstrong,\r\n    Vainly he called to his side captains skilled and courageous,\r\n    Gathered beneath his banner countless legions of soldiers,\r\n    For he was timid at heart, a lambkin dressed as a tiger,\r\n    Merely a cowardly chicken, phoenix-feathered but spurless.\r\n    Pitiful was the fate of his house; for when he departed\r\n    Brother with brother strove and quarrels arose in the household.\r\n\r\n\r\nShên Pʻei and some others set about the mourning ceremonies for the\r\ndead man. His wife, the Lady Liu, put to death five of his favourite\r\nconcubines, and such was the bitterness of her jealousy that, not\r\ncontent with this, she shaved off the hair and slashed the faces of\r\ntheir poor corpses lest their spirits should meet and rejoin her late\r\nhusband in the land of shades beneath the Nine Springs. Her son\r\nfollowed up this piece of cruelty by slaying all the relatives of the\r\nunhappy concubines lest they should avenge their death.\r\n\r\nShên Pʻei and Fêng Chi declared Yüan Shang successor with the titles of\r\nMinister of War and General Governor of the four prefectures of Chʻi,\r\nChʻing, Yu and Ping and sent in a report of the death of the late\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nAt this time Yüan Tʻan, the eldest son, had already marched out his\r\narmy to oppose Tsʻao Tsʻao, but hearing of his father’s death he called\r\nin Kuo Tʻu and Hsin Pʻing to consult as to his course of action.\r\n\r\n“In your absence, my lord,” said Kuo Tʻu, “the two advisers of your\r\nyounger brother will certainly set him up as lord, wherefore you must\r\nact quickly.”\r\n\r\n“Those two, Shên and Fêng, have already laid their plans,” said Hsin\r\nPʻing. “If you go you will meet with some misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“Then what should I do?” asked Tʻan.\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu replied, “Go and camp near the city and watch what is taking\r\nplace while I enter and enquire.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly Kuo Tʻu entered the city and sought an interview with the\r\nyoung governor.\r\n\r\n“Why did not my brother come?” asked Shang after the usual salutes.\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu said, “He cannot come as he is in the camp unwell.”\r\n\r\n“By the command of my late father I take the lordship. Now I confer\r\nupon my brother the rank of General of Cavalry and I wish him to go at\r\nonce to attack Tsʻao Tsʻao, who is pressing on the borders. I will\r\nfollow as soon as my army is in order.”\r\n\r\n“There is no one in our camp to give advice,” said Kuo Tʻu. “I wish to\r\nhave the services of Shên Pʻei and Fêng Chi.”\r\n\r\n“I also need the help of these two,” said Shang, “And as I am always\r\nworking at schemes I do not see how I can do without them.”\r\n\r\n“Then let one of these two go,” replied Tʻu.\r\n\r\nShang could do no other than accede to this request so he bade the two\r\nmen cast lots who should go. Fêng Chi drew the lot and was appointed,\r\nreceiving a seal of office. Then he accompanied Kuo Tʻu to the camp.\r\nBut when he arrived and found Tʻan in perfect health he grew suspicious\r\nand resigned. Tʻan angrily refused to accept his resignation and was\r\ndisposed to put him to death, but Kuo Tʻu privately dissuaded him\r\nsaying, “Tsʻao Tsʻao is on the borders and he must be kept here to\r\nallay your brother’s suspicions. After we have beaten Tsʻao we can at\r\nonce make an attempt on Chʻichou.”\r\n\r\nYüan Tʻan agreed and forthwith broke up his camp to march against the\r\nenemy. He reached Liyang and lost no time in offering battle. He chose\r\nfor his champion Wang Chao and, when he rode out, Tsʻao Tsʻao sent Hsü\r\nHuang to meet him. These two had fought but a few bouts when Wang Chao\r\nwas slain. At once Tsʻao’s army pressed forward and Tʻan suffered a\r\nsevere defeat. He drew off his army and retired into Liyang, whence he\r\nsent to his brother for reinforcements.\r\n\r\nShang and his adviser Shên Pʻei discussed the matter and half a legion\r\nonly was sent. Tsʻao hearing of the despatch of this meagre force sent\r\ntwo generals to waylay them and the half legion was destroyed. When Tan\r\nheard of the inadequate force sent and their destruction he was very\r\nwrath and roundly abused Fêng Chi. Fêng replied, “Let me write to my\r\nlord and pray him to come himself.”\r\n\r\nSo Fêng Chi wrote and the letter was sent. When it arrived Shang again\r\nconsulted Shên Pʻei who said, “Kuo Tʻu, your elder brother’s adviser,\r\nis very guileful. Formerly he left without discussion because Tsʻao was\r\non the border. If Tsʻao be defeated there will certainly be an attempt\r\non you. The better plan is to withhold assistance and use Tsʻao’s hand\r\nto destroy your rival.”\r\n\r\nShang took his advice and no help was sent. When the messenger returned\r\nwithout success Tʻan was very angry and showed it by putting Fêng Chi\r\nto death. He also began to talk of surrendering to Tsʻao. Soon spies\r\nbrought news of this to Shang and again Shên Pʻei was called in. Said\r\nhe, “If he goes over to Tsʻao they will both attack Chʻichou and we\r\nshall be in great danger.” Finally Shên Pʻei and Su Yu were left to\r\ntake care of the defence of the city and Yüan Shang marched his army to\r\nthe rescue of his brother.\r\n\r\n“Who dares lead the van?” said Yüan Shang.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers named Lü volunteered and three legions were given them.\r\nThey were the first to reach Liyang.\r\n\r\nTʻan was pleased that his brother had made up his mind to play a\r\nbrotherly part and come to his aid, so he at once abandoned all thought\r\nof going over to the enemy. He being in the city, Yüan Shang camped\r\noutside, making that an angle of their strategic position. Before long\r\nYüan Hsi, the second brother, and their cousin, Kao Kan, arrived with\r\ntheir legions and also camped outside the city.\r\n\r\nEngagements took place daily and Shang suffered many defeats. On the\r\nother hand Tsʻao was victorious and elated. In the second month of the\r\neighth year, Tsʻao made separate attacks on all four armies and won the\r\nday against each. Then they abandoned Liyang and Tsʻao pursued them to\r\nChʻichou, where Tʻan and Shang went into the city to defend it, while\r\ntheir brother and cousin camped about thirty li away making a show of\r\ngreat force. When Tsʻao had made many attacks without success Kuo Chia\r\nproffered the following plan.\r\n\r\nHe said, “There is dissension among the Yüans because the elder has\r\nbeen superseded in the succession. The brothers are about equally\r\nstrong and each has his party. If we oppose them they unite to assist\r\neach other, but if we have patience they will be weakened by family\r\nstrife. Wherefore send first a force to reduce Liu Piao in Chingchou\r\nand let the fraternal quarrels develop. When they have fully developed\r\nwe can smite them and settle the matter.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao approved of the plan. So leaving Chia Hsü as Prefect of Liyang\r\nand Tsʻao Hung as guard at Kuantu the army went away toward Chingchou.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers Tʻan and Shang congratulated each other on the\r\nwithdrawal of their enemy, and their brother Hsi and cousin marched\r\ntheir armies back to their own districts.\r\n\r\nThen the quarrels began. Tʻan said to his confidants, “I, the eldest,\r\nhave been prevented from succeeding my father, while the youngest son,\r\nborn of a second wife, received the main heritage. My heart is bitter.”\r\n\r\nSaid Kuo Tʻu, “Camp your men outside, invite your brother and Shên Pʻei\r\nto a banquet and assassinate them. The whole matter is easily settled.”\r\n\r\nAnd Tʻan agreed. It happened that a certain Wang Hsiu came just then\r\nfrom Chʻingchou whom Tʻan took into his confidence. Wang opposed the\r\nmurder plan saying, “Brothers are as one’s limbs. How can you possibly\r\nsucceed if at a moment of conflict with an enemy you cut off one of\r\nyour hands? If you abandon your brother and sever relationship, whom\r\nwill you take in all the world as a relation? That fellow Kuo is a\r\ndangerous mischief-maker, who would sow dissension between brothers for\r\na momentary advantage, and I beg you to shut your ears and not listen\r\nto his persuasions.”\r\n\r\nThis was displeasing to Tʻan and he angrily dismissed Wang, while he\r\nsent the treacherous invitation to his brother.\r\n\r\nHis brother and Shên Pʻei talked over the matter. Shên Pʻei said, “I\r\nrecognise one of Kuo Tʻu’s stratagems and if you go, my lord, you will\r\nbe the victim of their plot. Rather strike at them at once.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Shang rode out to battle. His brother Tʻan, seeing him come\r\nwith five legions, knew that his treachery had been discovered, so he\r\nalso took the field, and when the forces were near enough Tʻan opened\r\non Shang with a volley of abuse.\r\n\r\n“You poisoned my father and usurped the succession; now you come out to\r\nslay your elder brother?”\r\n\r\nThe battle went against Tʻan. Shang himself took part in the fight,\r\nrisking the arrows and the stones. He urged on his men and drove his\r\nbrother off the field. He took refuge in Pʻingyüan. Yüan Shang drew off\r\nhis men to his own city.\r\n\r\nYüan Tʻan and Kuo Tʻu decided upon a new attack and this time they\r\nchose Tsʻên Pi as leader. Yüan Shang went to meet him. When both sides\r\nhad been arrayed and the banners were flying and the drums beating,\r\nTsʻên Pi rode out to challenge and railed at his opponent. At first\r\nShang was going to answer the challenge himself but Lü Kʻuang actually\r\nwent out. Lü and Tsʻên met but had fought only a few bouts when the\r\nlatter fell. Tʻan’s men were once more defeated and ran away to\r\nPʻingyüan. Shên Pʻei urged his master to press home the advantage and\r\nTʻan was driven into the city, where he fortified himself and would not\r\ngo out. So the city was besieged on three sides.\r\n\r\nTʻan asked his strategist what should be done next and he said, “The\r\ncity is short of food, the enemy is flushed with victory and we cannot\r\nstand against them. My idea is to send some one to offer surrender to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao and thus get him to attack Chʻichou. Your brother will be\r\nforced to return thither, which will leave you free to join in the\r\nattack. We may capture Shang. Should Tsʻao begin to get the better of\r\nyour brother’s army we will lend our force to help him against Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, and as Tsʻao’s base of supply is distant we shall drive him off.\r\nAnd we can seize on Chʻichou and begin our real career.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing this scheme be attempted, who is the man for a messenger?”\r\n\r\n“I have one, Hsin Pʻi, Hsin Pʻing’s younger brother; he is magistrate\r\nhere in this very place. He is a fluent speaker and good scholar and\r\nsuited to your purpose.”\r\n\r\nSo Hsin Pʻi was summoned and came readily enough. Letters were given\r\nhim and an escort of three companies took him beyond the border. He\r\ntravelled as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nAt that time Tsʻao’s camp was at Hsipʻing and he was attacking Liu\r\nPiao, who had sent Yüan-tê out to offer the first resistance. No battle\r\nhad yet taken place.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival Hsin Pʻi was admitted to the Minister’s\r\npresence, and after the ceremonies of greeting Tsʻao asked the object\r\nof the visit. Hsin Pʻi explained that Yüan Tʻan wanted assistance and\r\npresented his despatches. Tsʻao read them and told the messenger to\r\nwait in his camp while he called his officers to a council.\r\n\r\nThe council met. Chʻêng Yu said, “Yüan Tʻan has been forced into making\r\nthis offer because of the pressure of his brother’s attack. Put no\r\ntrust in him.”\r\n\r\nLü Chʻien and Man Chʻung said, “You have led your armies here for a\r\nspecial purpose; how can you abandon that and go to assist Yüan Tʻan?”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, not one of you is giving good advice,” interposed Hsün Yu.\r\n“This is how I regard it. Since there is universal trouble, in the\r\nmidst of which Liu Piao remains quietly content with his position\r\nbetween Chiang and Han, it is evident that he has no ambition to\r\nenlarge his borders. The Yüans hold four Chou and have many legions of\r\nsoldiers. Harmony between the two brothers means success for the family\r\nand none can foresee what will happen in the Empire. Now take advantage\r\nof this fraternal conflict and let them fight till they are weakened\r\nand have to yield to our Minister. Then Yüan Shang can be removed, and\r\nwhen the times are suitable, Yüan Tʻan can be destroyed in his turn.\r\nThus peace will ensue. This present combination of circumstances is to\r\nbe taken advantage of to full measure.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao realised the truth of this and treated the messenger well. At a\r\nbanquet he said, “But is this surrender of Yüan Tʻan real or false? Do\r\nyou really think that Shang’s army is sure to overcome him?”\r\n\r\nHsin Pʻi replied, “Illustrious one, do not enquire into the degree of\r\nsincerity; rather regard the situation. The Yüans have been suffering\r\nmilitary losses for years and are powerless without, while their\r\nstrategists are put to death within. The brothers seize every chance to\r\nspeak evil of each other and their country is divided. Add to this\r\nfamine, supplemented by calamities and general exhaustion, and\r\neverybody, wise as well as simple, can see that the catastrophe is\r\nnear, the time ordained of Heaven for the destruction of the Yüans is\r\nat hand. Now you have a force attacking Yeh, and if Yüan Shang will not\r\nreturn to give aid the place of refuge is lost. If he help, then Tʻan\r\nwill follow up and smite him, making use of your power to destroy the\r\nremnant of his brother’s army, just as the autumn gale sweeps away the\r\nfallen leaves. If he do not, then he will attack Chingchou. Now\r\nChingchou is rich, the government peaceful, the people submissive and\r\nit cannot be shaken. Moreover, there is no greater threat to it than\r\nHopei. If that be reduced then the task is complete. I pray you, Sir,\r\nthink of it.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry that I did not meet you earlier,” said Tsʻao, much\r\ngratified with this speech.\r\n\r\nForthwith orders were given to return and attack Chʻichou. Yüan-tê,\r\nfearing this retirement was only a ruse, allowed it to proceed without\r\ninterference and himself returned to Chingchou.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan Shang heard that Tsʻao had crossed the river he hastily led\r\nhis army back to Yeh, ordering the two Lüs to guard the rear. His\r\nbrother Tʻan started from Pʻingyüan with a force in pursuit. He had not\r\nproceeded far when he heard a bomb and two bodies of men came out in\r\nfront of him and checked his progress. Their leaders were Lü Kʻuang and\r\nLü Hsiang. Tʻan reined in and addressed them, saying, “While my father\r\nlived I never treated you badly; why do you support my brother and try\r\nto injure me?”\r\n\r\nThe two men had no reply to make, but they dismounted and bowed before\r\nhim yielding submission.\r\n\r\nTʻan said, “Do not surrender to me but to the Minister,” and he led\r\nthem back to camp, where he waited the arrival of Tsʻao and then\r\npresented the pair. Tsʻao received them well. He promised his daughter\r\nto Tʻan to wife and he appointed the two brothers as advisers.\r\n\r\nWhen Tʻan asked Tsʻao to attack Chʻichou the reply was “Supplies are\r\nshort and difficult to transport. I must turn the waters of the Chishui\r\ninto the Paiho from Chiho whereby to convey my grain and afterwards I\r\ncan advance.”\r\n\r\nOrdering Tʻan to remain in Pʻingyüan, Tsʻao retired into camp at\r\nLiyang. The two brothers Lü, who were renegades from Yüan Shang, were\r\nnow raised to noble rank and followed the army as supernumeraries.\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu noted this advancement and said to Tʻan, “He has promised you a\r\ndaughter to wife. I fear that bodes no good. Now he has given titles of\r\nnobility to the two Lüs and taken them with him. This is a trap for the\r\nnorthern people but he intends evil toward us. You, my lord, should\r\nhave two generals’ seals engraved and send them secretly to the\r\nbrothers so that you may have friends at court ready for the day when\r\nTsʻao shall have broken your brother’s power and we can begin to work\r\nagainst him.”\r\n\r\nThe seals were engraved and sent. As soon as the brothers received them\r\nthey informed Tsʻao Tsʻao, who smiled saying, “He wants your support so\r\nhe sends you seals as officers. I will consider it as soon as Yüan\r\nShang has been dealt with. In the meantime you may accept the seals\r\ntill I shall decide what to do.”\r\n\r\nThenceforward Tʻan was doomed. Shên Pʻei and his master also discussed\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao is getting grain into Paikou, which means an attack on Chʻichou;\r\nwhat is to be done?” asked Shang.\r\n\r\nShên Pʻei replied, “Send letters to Yin Kai, Chief of Wuan, bidding him\r\ncamp at Maochʻêng to secure the road to Shangtang and direct Chu Ku to\r\nmaintain Hantan as a distant auxiliary. Then you may advance on\r\nPʻingyüan and attack Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nThe plan seemed good. Yüan Shang left Shên Pʻei and Chʻên Lin in charge\r\nof Chʻichou, appointed two captains Ma Yen and Chang Kʻai as van\r\nleaders, and set out hastily for Pʻingyüan.\r\n\r\nWhen Tʻan heard of the approach of his brother’s army he sent urgent\r\nmessages to Tsʻao, who said to himself, “I am going to get Chʻichou\r\nthis time.”\r\n\r\nJust at this time it happened that Hsü Yu came down from the capital.\r\nWhen he heard that Yüan Shang was attacking his brother Tʻan he sought\r\nTsʻao and said, “You, Sir Minister, sit here on guard; are you waiting\r\ntill Heaven’s thunder shall strike the two Yüans?”\r\n\r\n“I have thought it all out,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen he ordered Tsʻao Hung to go and fight against Yeh, while he led\r\nanother army against Yin Kai. Kai could make no adequate defence and\r\nwas killed by Hsü Chʻu. His men ran away and presently joined Tsʻao’s\r\narmy. Next he led the army to Hantan and Chu Ku came out to fight him.\r\nChang Liao advanced to fight with Chu and after the third encounter the\r\nlatter was defeated and fled. Liao went after him and when their two\r\nhorses were not far apart, Liao took his bow and shot. The fleeing\r\nsoldier fell as the bowstring twanged. Tsʻao sent Ma Yen to complete\r\nthe rout and Chu Ku’s force was broken up.\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao led his armies to an attack on Chʻichou. Tsʻao Hung went\r\nclose to the city and a regular siege began. The army encompassed the\r\ncity and began by throwing up great mounds. They also tunnelled\r\nsubterranean ways.\r\n\r\nWithin the city Shên Pʻei turned his whole care to the defence and\r\nissued the severest commands. The captain of the east gate, one Fêng\r\nLi, got intoxicated and failed to keep his watch for which he was\r\nseverely punished. He resented this, sneaked out of the city, went over\r\nto the besiegers and told them how the place could be attacked.\r\n\r\n“The earth within the Tʻumên is solid enough to be tunnelled and\r\nentrance can be effected there,” said the traitor.\r\n\r\nSo Fêng Li was sent with three hundred men to carry out his plan under\r\ncover of darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter Fêng Li had deserted to the enemy Shên Pʻei went every night to\r\nthe wall to inspect the men on duty. The night of the sapping he went\r\nthere as usual and saw that there were no lights outside the city and\r\nall was perfectly quiet. So he said to himself, “Fêng is certain to try\r\nto come into the city by an underground road.” Whereupon he ordered his\r\nmen to bring up stones and pile them on the cover of the tunnel\r\nopening. The opening was stopped up and the attacking party perished in\r\nthe tunnel they had excavated. Tsʻao having failed in this attempt\r\nabandoned the scheme of underground attack. He drew off the army to a\r\nplace above the Hêngshui to await till Yüan Shang should return to\r\nrelieve the city.\r\n\r\nYüan Shang heard of the defeat of Yin Kai and Chu Ku, and the siege of\r\nhis own city, and bethought himself of relieving it. One of his\r\ncaptains, Ma Yen, said, “The high road will surely be ambushed; we must\r\nfind some other way. We can take a bye-road from the Western Hills and\r\nget through at Fushuikʻou, whence we can fall upon Tsʻao’s camp.”\r\n\r\nThe plan was acceptable and Shang started off with the main body, Ma\r\nYen and Chang Kʻai being rear guard.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s spies soon found out this move and when they reported it he\r\nsaid, “If he comes by the high road I shall have to keep out of the\r\nway; if by the Western Hills bye-road I can settle him in one battle.\r\nAnd I think he will show a blaze as a signal to the besieged that they\r\nmay make a sortie. I shall prepare to attack both.” So he made his\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nNow Yüan Shang went out by the Fushui Pass east toward Yangpʻing and\r\nnear this he camped. Thence to his own city was seventeen li. The\r\nFushui stream ran beside the camp. He ordered his men to collect\r\nfirewood and grass ready for the blaze he intended to make at night as\r\nhis signal. He also sent Li Fu, a civil officer, disguised as an\r\nofficer of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army, to inform Shên Pʻei of his intentions.\r\n\r\nFu reached the city wall safely and called out to the guards to open.\r\nShên Pʻei recognised his voice and let him in. Thus Shên Pʻei knew of\r\nthe arrangements for his relief and it was agreed that a blaze should\r\nbe raised within the city so that the sortie could be simultaneous with\r\nShang’s attack. Orders were given to collect inflammables.\r\n\r\nThen said Fu, “As your food supply is short it would be well for the\r\nold men, the feeble soldiers and the women to surrender. This will come\r\nupon them as a surprise and we will send the soldiers out behind them.”\r\n\r\nShên Pʻei promised to do all this and next day they hoisted on the wall\r\na white flag with the words “The populace of Chʻichou surrender” on it.\r\n\r\n“Ho ho! This means no food,” said Tsʻao. “They are sending away the\r\nnon-combatants to escape feeding them. And the soldiers will follow\r\nbehind them.”\r\n\r\nSo on two sides he laid an ambush of three companies while he went near\r\nthe wall in full state. Presently the gates were opened and out came\r\nthe people supporting their aged folk and leading their little ones by\r\nthe hand. Each carried a white flag. As soon as the people had passed\r\nthe gate the soldiers followed with a rush.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao showed a red flag and the ambushed soldiers fell upon\r\nthe sortie. The men tried to return and Tsʻao’s men made a direct\r\nattack. The chase continued to the drawbridge, but there they met with\r\na tremendous shower of arrows and crossbow bolts which checked the\r\nadvance. Tsʻao’s helmet was struck and the crest carried away.\r\n\r\nSo the men retired. As soon as Tsʻao had changed his dress and mounted\r\na fresh horse he set out at the head of the army to attack Yüan Shang’s\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nYüan Shang led the defence. The attack came simultaneously from many\r\ndirections, the defenders were quite disorganised and presently\r\ndefeated. Shang led his men back by the hills and made a camp under\r\ntheir shelter. Thence he sent messengers to urge Ma Yen and Chang Kʻai\r\nto bring up the supports. He did not know that Tsʻao had sent the two\r\nLüs to persuade these two into surrender and that they had already\r\npassed under Tsʻao’s banner, and he had made them marquises.\r\n\r\nJust before going to attack the Western Hills he sent the two Lüs with\r\nMa Yen and Chang Kʻai to seize the source of Yüan Shang’s supplies.\r\nShang had realised he could not hold the hills so he went by night to\r\nIkʻou. Before he could get camped he saw flaring lights springing up\r\nall around him and soon an attack began. He was taken aback and had to\r\noppose the enemy with his men half armed, his steeds unsaddled. His\r\narmy suffered and he had to retreat another fifty li. By that time his\r\nforce was too enfeebled to show any resistance and as no other course\r\nwas possible he sent to ask that he might surrender. Tsʻao feigned to\r\nconsent, but that night he sent a force to raid Shang’s camp. Then it\r\nbecame flight, abandoning everything, seals, emblems of office and even\r\npersonal clothing. He made for the hills.\r\n\r\nThen came an attack on Chʻichou and to help out this Hsü Yu suggested\r\ndrowning the city by turning the course of the River Chang. Tsʻao\r\nadopted the suggestion and at once sent a small number of men to dig a\r\nchannel to lead the water to the city. All told, it was forty li.\r\n\r\nShên Pʻei saw the diggers from the city wall and noticed that they made\r\nonly a shallow channel. He chuckled, saying to himself, “What is the\r\nuse of such a channel to drown out the city from a deep river?”\r\n\r\nSo he made no preparations to keep out the water.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as night came on Tsʻao increased his army of diggers\r\ntenfold and by daylight the channel was deepened to twenty feet and the\r\nwater was flowing in a great stream into the city where it already\r\nstood some feet deep. So this misfortune was added to the lack of food.\r\n\r\nHsin Pʻi now displayed the captured seal and garments of Yüan Shang\r\nhung out on spears, to the great shame of their late owner, and called\r\nupon the people of the city to surrender. This angered Shên Pʻei, who\r\navenged the insult by putting to death on the city wall the whole of\r\nthe Hsin family who were within the city. There were nearly a hundred\r\nof them and their severed heads were cast down from the walls. Hsin Pʻi\r\nwept exceedingly.\r\n\r\nShên Pʻei’s nephew Shên Yung, one of the gate wardens, was a dear\r\nfriend of Hsin Pʻi and the murder of Pʻi’s family greatly distressed\r\nhim. He wrote a secret letter offering to betray the city and tied it\r\nto an arrow, which he shot out among the besiegers. The soldiers found\r\nit, gave it to Hsin Pʻi and he took it to his chief.\r\n\r\nTsʻao issued an order that the family of the Yüans should be spared\r\nwhen the city should be taken and that no one who surrendered should be\r\nput to death. The next day the soldiers entered by the west gate,\r\nopened for them by Shên’s nephew. Hsin Pʻi was the first to prance in\r\non horseback and the men followed.\r\n\r\nWhen Shên, who was on the southeast of the city, saw the enemy within\r\nthe gates he placed himself at the head of some horsemen and dashed\r\ntoward them. He was met and captured by Hsü Huang who bound him and led\r\nhim outside the city. On the road they met Hsin Pʻi, who ground his\r\nteeth with rage at the murderer of his relatives and then struck the\r\nprisoner over the head with his whip and abused him as a murderer. Shên\r\nretorted by calling him traitor and saying how sorry he was not to have\r\nslain him before.\r\n\r\nWhen the captive was taken into Tsʻao’s presence Tsʻao said, “Do you\r\nknow who opened the gate to let me in?”\r\n\r\n“No; I know not.”\r\n\r\n“It was your nephew Shên Yung who gave up the gate,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“He was always unprincipled; and it has come to this!” said Shên.\r\n\r\n“The other day when I approached the city why did you shoot so hard at\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry we shot too little.”\r\n\r\n“As a faithful adherent of the Yüans you could do no otherwise. Now\r\nwill you come over to me?”\r\n\r\n“Never; I will never surrender.”\r\n\r\nHsin Pʻi threw himself on the ground with lamentations, saying, “Eighty\r\nof my people murdered by this ruffian; I pray you slay him, O\r\nMinister!”\r\n\r\n“Alive, I have served the Yüans,” said Shên, “dead, I will be their\r\nghost. I am no flattering time-server as you are. Kill me!”\r\n\r\nTsʻao gave the order; they led him away to put him to death. On the\r\nexecution ground he said to the executioners, “My lord is in the north,\r\nI pray you not to make me face the south.” So he knelt facing the north\r\nand extended his neck for the fatal stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Who of all th’ official throng\r\n        In Hopei was true like Shên?\r\n        Sad his fate! he served a fool,\r\n        But faithful, as the ancient men.\r\n        Straight and true was every word,\r\n        Never from the road he swerved.\r\n        Faithful unto death, he died\r\n        Gazing toward the lord he’d served.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus died Shên Pʻei and from respect for his character Tsʻao ordered\r\nthat he be buried honourably on the north of the city.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao then entered the city. As he was starting he saw the\r\nexecutioners hurrying forward a prisoner who proved to be Chʻên Lin.\r\n\r\n“You wrote that manifesto for Yüan Shao. If you had only directed your\r\ndiatribe against me, it would not have mattered. But why did you shame\r\nmy forefathers?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“When the arrow is on the string, it must fly,” replied Lin.\r\n\r\nThose about Tsʻao urged him to put Chʻên Lin to death, but he was\r\nspared on account of his genius and given a small civil post.\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao’s eldest son was named Pʻei, otherwise Tzŭ-hêng. At the\r\ntaking of the city he was eighteen years of age. When he was born a\r\ndark purplish halo hung over the house for a whole day. One who\r\nunderstood the meaning of such manifestations had secretly told Tsʻao\r\nthat the halo belonged to the Imperial class and portended honours\r\nwhich could not be put into words.\r\n\r\nAt eight the lad could compose very skilfully and he was well read in\r\nancient history. Now he was an adept at all military arts and very fond\r\nof fencing. He had gone with his father on the expedition to Chʻichou.\r\nHe led his escort in the direction of the Yüan family dwelling, and\r\nwhen he reached it he strode in sword in hand. When some one would have\r\nstayed him, saying that by order of the Minister no one was to enter\r\nthe house, he bade them begone. The guards fell back and he made his\r\nway into the private rooms, where he saw two women weeping in each\r\nother’s arms. He went forward to slay them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Four generations of honours, gone like a dream,\r\n    Fate follows on ever surely, though slow she seem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of the two women will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO PʻEI FINDS A WIFE:\r\nA PLAN FOR SETTLING LIAOTUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was said, Tsʻao Pʻei, having made his way into the Yüan Palace, saw\r\ntwo women there whom he was about to kill. Suddenly a red light shone\r\nin his eyes, and he paused. Lowering his sword he said, “Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Thy handmaid is the widow of the late Yüan Shao, née Liu,” said the\r\nelder of the two, “and this is the wife of Hsi, his second son. She was\r\nof the Chên family. When Hsi was sent to command in Yu her family\r\nobjected to her going so far from home and she stayed behind.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Pʻei drew her toward him and looked at her closely. Her hair hung\r\ndisordered, her face was dusty and tear-stained, but when, with the\r\nsleeve of his inner garment, he had wiped away these disfigurements he\r\nsaw a woman of exquisite loveliness, with a complexion clear as jade\r\ntouched with the tender bloom of a flower petal, a woman indeed\r\nbeautiful enough to ruin a kingdom.\r\n\r\n“I am the son of the Minister Tsʻao,” said he turning to the elder\r\nwoman. “I will guarantee your safety so you need fear nothing.”\r\n\r\nHe then put by his sword and sat down at the upper end of the room.\r\n\r\nAs the great Minister Tsʻao was entering the gate of the conquered city\r\nHsü Yu rode up very quickly, passed him and pointed with his whip at\r\nthe gate saying, “A-man, you would not have been here but for my\r\nplans.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao laughed, but his captains were very annoyed. When he reached the\r\nYüan residence he stopped at the gate, and asked if any one had gone\r\nin. The guard at the gate said, “Your son is within.” Tsʻao called him\r\nout and chid him, but the wife of the late Prefect interposed, saying,\r\n“But for your son we had not been saved. I desire to present to you a\r\nlady, of the Chên family, as a handmaid to your son.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao bade them bring out the girl and she bowed before him. After\r\nlooking at her intently he said, “Just the wife for him!” and he told\r\nTsʻao Pʻei to take her to wife.\r\n\r\nAfter the conquest of Chʻichou had been made quite sure, Tsʻao made a\r\nceremonial visit to the Yüan family cemetery, where he sacrificed at\r\nthe tomb of his late rival, bowed his head and lamented bitterly.\r\n\r\nTurning to his captains he said, “Not long ago when Pên-chʻu and I\r\nworked together in military matters he asked me, saying, ‘If this\r\ndisturbance continue what districts should be held?’ and I replied\r\nasking him what he thought. He said, ‘To the south I would hold the\r\nriver, on the north, guard against Yen and Tai and the hordes from the\r\nShamo. Thence southward I would try for the Empire and do you not think\r\nI might succeed?’ I replied saying, I depended upon the wisdom and\r\nforce of the world directed by Tao; then every thing would be possible.\r\nThese words seem as if spoken only yesterday, and now he is gone.\r\nThinking over it I cannot refrain from tears.”\r\n\r\nHis officers were deeply affected. Tsʻao treated the widow generously,\r\ngiving her gold and silks and food to her content.\r\n\r\nHe also issued a further order that the taxes in Hopei would be\r\nremitted in consideration of the sufferings of the people during the\r\nwarlike operations. He sent up a memorial and formally became Governor\r\nof Chʻichou.\r\n\r\nOne day Hsü Chʻu, riding in at the east gate, met Hsü Yu, who called\r\nout to him, “Would you fellows be riding through here if it had not\r\nbeen for me?”\r\n\r\nHsü Chʻu replied, “We fellows, those who survive and those who\r\nperished, risked our lives in bloody battle to get this city, so do not\r\nbrag of your deeds.”\r\n\r\n“You are a lot of blockheads, not worth talking about,” said Yu.\r\n\r\nChʻu in his anger drew his sword and ran him through. Then he took his\r\nhead and went to tell Tsʻao the reason.\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao, “He and I were old friends and we could joke together. Why\r\ndid you kill him?”\r\n\r\nHe blamed Hsü Chʻu very severely and gave orders that the corpse should\r\nbe buried honourably.\r\n\r\nHe enquired for any wise and reputable men who were known to be living\r\nin the district and was told of a certain cavalry officer named Tsʻui\r\nYen, of Tungwu City, who had on many occasions given valuable advice to\r\nYüan Shao. As the advice was not followed Yen had pleaded indisposition\r\nand remained at home.\r\n\r\nTsʻao sent for this man, gave him an office and said to him, “According\r\nto the former registers there are three hundred thousand households in\r\nthe district so that one may well call it a major district.”\r\n\r\nYen replied, “The Empire is rent and the country is torn; the brothers\r\nYüan are at war and the people have been stripped naked. Yet, Sir, you\r\ndo not hasten to enquire after local conditions and how to rescue the\r\npeople from misery, but first compute the possibilities of taxation.\r\nCan you expect to gain the support of our people by such means?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao accepted the rebuke, changed his policy, thanked him and treated\r\nhim all the better for it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Chʻichou was settled, Tsʻao sent to find out the movements\r\nof Yüan Tʻan. He heard he was ravaging Kanling and the places near it\r\nin the south and west. Moreover, the scouts brought the news that Yüan\r\nShang had fled to the hills. An expedition had been sent against him\r\nbut Shang would not face a battle. He had gone away to Yuchou to his\r\nbrother Hsi.\r\n\r\nTʻan, having surrendered with all his army, yet prepared for another\r\nattempt on Chʻichou. Whereupon Tsʻao summoned him. Tʻan refused to come\r\nand Tsʻao sent letters breaking off the marriage with his daughter.\r\nSoon after Tsʻao led an expedition against Tʻan and marched to\r\nPʻingyüan, whereupon Tʻan sent to Liu Piao to beg assistance. Piao sent\r\nfor Liu Pei to consult about this and he said, “Tsʻao is very strong\r\nnow that he has overcome Chʻichou and the Yüans will be unable to hold\r\nout for long. Nothing is to be gained by helping this man and it may\r\ngive Tsʻao the loophole he is always looking for to attack this place.\r\nMy advice is to keep the army in condition and devote all our energies\r\nto defence.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed; but what shall we say?” said Piao.\r\n\r\n“Write to both the brothers as peacemaker in gracious terms.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly Liu Piao wrote thus to Yüan Tʻan:—“When the superior man\r\nwould escape danger he does not go to an enemy State. I heard recently\r\nthat you had crooked the knee to Tsʻao, which was ignoring the enmity\r\nbetween him and your father, rejecting the duties of brotherhood and\r\nleaving behind you the shame of an alliance with the enemy. If your\r\nbrother, the successor to Chʻichou, has acted unfraternally, your duty\r\nwas to bend your inclination to follow him and wait till the state of\r\naffairs had settled. Would it not have been very noble to bring about\r\nthe redress of wrongs?”\r\n\r\nAnd to Yüan Shang he wrote:—“Your brother, the ruler of Chʻingchou, is\r\nof an impulsive temperament and confuses right with wrong. You ought\r\nfirst to have destroyed Tsʻao in order to put an end to the hatred\r\nwhich your father bore him and, when the situation had become settled,\r\nto have endeavoured to redress the wrongs. Would not that have been\r\nwell? If you persist in following this mistaken course, remember the\r\nhound and the hare, both so wearied that the peasant got the hare.”\r\n\r\nFrom this letter Yüan Tʻan saw that Liu Piao had no intention of\r\nhelping him, and feeling he alone could not withstand Tsʻao, he\r\nabandoned Pʻingyüan and fled to Nanpʻi, whither Tsʻao pursued him. The\r\nweather was very cold and the river was frozen, so that his grain boats\r\ncould not move. Wherefore Tsʻao ordered the inhabitants to break the\r\nice and tow the boats. When the peasants heard the order they ran away.\r\nTsʻao angrily wished to arrest and behead them. When they heard this\r\nthey went to his camp in a body and offered their heads to the sword.\r\n\r\n“If I do not kill you, my order will not be obeyed,” said Tsʻao. “Yet\r\nsupposing I cut off your heads—but I cannot bear to do that. Quickly\r\nflee to the hills and hide so that my soldiers do not capture you.”\r\n\r\nThe peasants left weeping.\r\n\r\nThen Yüan Tʻan led out his army against Tsʻao. When both sides were\r\narrayed Tsʻao rode to the front, pointed with his whip at his opponent\r\nand railed at him saying, “I treated you well; why then have you turned\r\nagainst me?”\r\n\r\nTʻan replied, “You have invaded my land, captured my cities and broken\r\noff my marriage; yet you accuse me of turning against you.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao ordered Hsü Huang to go out and give battle. Tʻan bade Pʻêng An\r\naccept the challenge. After a few bouts Pʻêng An was slain and Tʻan,\r\nhaving lost, fled and went into Nanpʻi, where he was besieged. Tʻan,\r\npanic-stricken, sent Hsin Pʻing to see Tsʻao and arrange surrender.\r\n\r\n“He is nothing but a fickle-minded child,” said Tsʻao. “He is never of\r\nthe same mind two days running and I cannot depend upon what he says.\r\nNow your brother is in my employ and has a post of importance, you had\r\nbetter remain here also.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Minister, you are in error,” said Hsin Pʻing. “It is said that the\r\nlord’s honour is the servant’s glory, the lord’s sadness is the\r\nservant’s shame. How can I turn my back on the family I have so long\r\nserved?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao felt he could not be persuaded and sent him back. Pʻing returned\r\nand told Tʻan the surrender could not be arranged and Tʻan turned on\r\nhim angrily calling him a traitor. At this unmerited reproach such a\r\nhuge wave of anger welled up in the man’s breast that he was overcome\r\nand fell in a swoon. They carried him out, but the shock had been too\r\nsevere and soon after he died. Tʻan regretted his conduct when it was\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nThen Kuo Tʻu said, “To-morrow when we go out to battle we will drive\r\nthe people out in front as a screen for the soldiers and we must fight\r\na winning battle.”\r\n\r\nThat night they assembled all the common people of the place and forced\r\ninto their hands swords and spears. At daylight they opened the four\r\ngates and a huge party with much shouting came out at each, peasantry\r\ncarrying arms in front, and soldiers behind them. They pushed on toward\r\nTsʻao’s camps and a mêlée began which lasted till near midday. But this\r\nwas quite indecisive, although heaps of dead lay everywhere.\r\n\r\nSeeing that success was at best only partial Tsʻao rode out to the\r\nhills near and thence had the drums beaten for a new attack under his\r\nown eye. Officers and men, seeing that he could observe them in person,\r\nexerted themselves to the utmost and Tʻan’s army was severely defeated.\r\nOf the peasantry driven into the battlefield multitudes were slain.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Hung, who displayed very great valour, burst into the press of\r\nbattle and met Yüan Tʻan face to face. The two slashed and hammered at\r\neach other and Tʻan was killed.\r\n\r\nKuo Tʻu saw that his side was wholly disorganised and tried to withdraw\r\ninto the shelter of the city. Yo Chin saw this and opened a tremendous\r\ndischarge of arrows so that the moat was soon filled with dead.\r\n\r\nThe city fell to Tsʻao; he entered and set about restoring peace and\r\norder. Then suddenly appeared a new army under one of Yüan Hsi’s\r\ncaptains. Tsʻao led out his men to meet them, but the two commanders\r\nlaid down their arms and yielded. They were rewarded with the rank of\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\nThen Chang Yen, the leader of the Black Hills Brigands, came with ten\r\nlegions and gave in his submission. He was made a General, Chiang-chün.\r\n\r\nBy an order of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s the head of Yüan Tʻan was exposed and\r\ndeath was threatened to any one who should lament for him. Nevertheless\r\na man dressed in mourning attire was arrested for weeping below the\r\nexposed head at the north gate. Taken into Tsʻao’s presence he said he\r\nwas Wang Hsiu and had been an officer in Chʻingchou. He had been\r\nexpelled because he had remonstrated with Tʻan, but when the news of\r\nTʻan’s death came he had come to weep for him.\r\n\r\n“Did you know of my command?”\r\n\r\n“I knew it.”\r\n\r\n“Yet you were not afraid?”\r\n\r\n“When one has received favours from a man in life it would be wrong not\r\nto mourn at his death. How can one stand in the world if one forgets\r\nduty through fear? If I could bury his body I would not mind death.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao said, “And there were many such as this in this district. What a\r\npity that the Yüan family could not make the best of them! But if they\r\nhad done so I should never have dared to turn my eyes toward this\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nThe intrepid mourner was not put to death. The remains of Yüan Tʻan\r\nwere properly interred and Wang Hsiu was well treated and even given an\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nIn his new position he was asked for advice about the best way to\r\nproceed against Yüan Shang, who had fled to his brother, but he held\r\nhis peace, thereby winning from Tsʻao renewed admiration for his\r\nconstancy. “He is indeed loyal!” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen he questioned Kuo Chia, who named certain officers who should be\r\nsent to bring about the surrender of the Yüans. Then five captains, to\r\nattack Yuchou along three routes, and other armies, were sent against\r\nPingchou.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers Shang and Hsi heard of Tsʻao’s advance with dismay for\r\nthey had no hope of successful resistance. Therefore they abandoned the\r\ncity and hastily marched into Liaohsi to the Governor Wuhuan Chʻu. But\r\nthe governor was not disposed to incur the enmity of the powerful Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao so he called his subordinates together to swear them to support\r\nhim and said, “I understand that Tsʻao Tsʻao is the most powerful man\r\nof the day and I am going to support him and those who do not go with\r\nme I shall put to death.”\r\n\r\nEach in turn smeared his lips with the blood of sacrifice and took the\r\noath till it came to the turn of Han Hêng. Instead he dashed his sword\r\nto the ground crying, “I have received great benefits from the Yüans.\r\nNow my lord has been vanquished; my knowledge was powerless to save\r\nhim, my bravery insufficient to cause me to die for him; I have failed\r\nin my duty. But I refuse to commit the crowning act of treachery and\r\nally myself with Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nThis speech made the others turn pale. The chief said, “For a great\r\nundertaking there must be lofty principles. However, success does not\r\nnecessarily depend upon universal support and since Han Hêng is\r\nactuated by such sentiments then let him follow his conscience.” So he\r\nturned Han Hêng out of the assembly.\r\n\r\nWuhuan Chʻu then went out of the city to meet and welcome Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\narmy and rendered his submission. He was well received and the title\r\ngiven him of Guardian of the North.\r\n\r\nThen the scouts came to say that the three captains had marched to\r\nPingchou but that Kao Kan had occupied Hukuan Pass and could not be\r\ndislodged. So Tsʻao marched thither himself. The defender still\r\nmaintaining his position Tsʻao asked for plans. Hsün Yu proposed that a\r\nband should go over pretending to be deserters. Tsʻao assented and then\r\ncalled the two brothers Lü, to whom he gave whispered orders. They left\r\nwith their companies.\r\n\r\nSoon they came near the pass and called out, saying, “We are old\r\nofficers in Yüan’s armies forced into surrender to Tsʻao. We find him\r\nso false and he treats us so meanly that we want to return to help our\r\nold master. Wherefore quickly open your gates to us.”\r\n\r\nKao Kan was suspicious, but he let the two officers come up to the\r\npass, and when they had stripped off their armour and left their horses\r\nthey were permitted to enter. And they said to Kao Kan, “Tsʻao’s men\r\nare new to the country and not settled; you ought to fall upon their\r\ncamp this very evening. If you approve we will lead the attack.”\r\n\r\nKao Kan decided to trust them and prepared to attack, giving the two\r\nbrothers the leadership. But as they drew near Tsʻao’s camp a great\r\nnoise arose behind them and they found themselves in an ambush attacked\r\non all sides. Realising too late that he had been the victim of a ruse,\r\nKao retreated to the pass, but found it occupied by the enemy. Kao Kan\r\nthen made the best of his way to the barbarian chieftain Shanyu. Tsʻao\r\ngave orders to hold the passes and sent companies in pursuit.\r\n\r\nWhen Kao Kan reached the boundary of Shanyu’s territory he met\r\nTso-hsien, Prince of the northern tribesmen. Kao Kan dismounted and\r\nmade a low obeisance saying, “Tsʻao is conquering and absorbing all the\r\nborders and your turn, O Prince, will come quickly. I pray you help me\r\nand let us smite together for the safety of the northern regions.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince replied, “I have no quarrel with Tsʻao, why then should he\r\ninvade my land? Do you desire to embroil me with him?”\r\n\r\nHe would have nothing to do with Kao Kan and sent him away. At his\r\nwits’ end Kan decided to try to join Liu Piao and got so far on his\r\njourney as Shanglu when he was taken prisoner and put to death by Wang\r\nYen. His head was sent to Tsʻao Tsʻao and Wang was created a marquis\r\nfor this service.\r\n\r\nThus Pingchou was conquered. Then Tsʻao Tsʻao began to discuss the\r\noverthrow of Wuhuan on the west. Tsʻao Hung, speaking in the name of\r\nhis brother officials, said, “The two brothers Yüan are nearly done for\r\nand too weak to be feared. They have fled far into the Sea of Sand and\r\nif we pursue them thither it may bring down Liu Piao and Liu Pei upon\r\nthe capital. Should we be unable to rescue it the misfortune would be\r\nimmense. Wherefore we beg you to return to Hsütu.”\r\n\r\nBut Kuo Chia was of different advice. “You are wrong,” said he. “Though\r\nthe prestige of our lord fills the Empire, yet the men of the desert,\r\nrelying upon their inaccessibility, will not be prepared against us.\r\nWherefore I say attack, and we shall conquer them. Beside Yüan Shao was\r\nkind to the nomads and the two brothers have been more so. They must be\r\ndestroyed. As for Liu Piao he is a mere gossip, who need not cause the\r\nleast anxiety. And Liu Pei is unfit for any heavy responsibility and\r\nwill take no trouble over a light one. You may leave the State with\r\nperfect safety and make as long an expedition as you choose. Nothing\r\nwill happen.”\r\n\r\n“You speak well, O Fêng-hsiao,” said Tsʻao. He led his legions, heavy\r\nand light, to the edge of the desert, with many waggons.\r\n\r\nThe expedition marched into the desert. The rolling ocean of yellow\r\nsand spread its waves before them and they saw far and near the eddying\r\nsand pillars, and felt the fierce winds that drove them forward. The\r\nroad became precipitous and progress difficult. Tsʻao began to think of\r\nreturning and spoke thereof to Kuo Chia, who had advised the journey.\r\nKuo had speedily fallen victim to the effects of the climate, and at\r\nthis time he lay in his cart very ill.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s tears fell as he said, “My friend, you are suffering for my\r\nambition to subdue the Shamo. I cannot bear to think you should be\r\nill.”\r\n\r\n“You have always been very good to me,” said the sick man, “and I can\r\nnever repay what I owe you.”\r\n\r\n“The country is exceedingly precipitous and I am thinking of going\r\nback; what think you?”\r\n\r\nChia replied, “The success of an expedition of this kind depends upon\r\ncelerity. To strike a sudden blow on a distant spot with a heavy\r\nbaggage train is difficult. To ensure success the need is light troops\r\nand a good road to strike quickly before an enemy has time to prepare.\r\nNow you must find guides who know the road well.”\r\n\r\nThen the sick adviser was left at Ichou for treatment and they sought\r\namong the natives for some persons to serve as guides. One of Yüan\r\nShao’s old captains knew those parts well and Tsʻao called him and\r\nquestioned him. He said, “Between autumn and summer this route is under\r\nwater, the shallow places too heavy for wheeled traffic, the deep parts\r\ninsufficient for boats. It is always difficult. Therefore you would do\r\nbetter to return and at Lulungkʻou cross the Paitʻan Pass into the\r\ndesert. Then advance to Liuchʻêng (Willow City) and smite before there\r\nis time to prepare. One sudden rush will settle Mao Tun.”\r\n\r\nFor this valuable information and plan Tʻien Chʻou was made a\r\n“Pacificator of the North” General, and went in advance as leader and\r\nguide. Next after him came Chang Liao and Tsʻao brought up the rear.\r\nThey advanced by double marches.\r\n\r\nTʻien Chʻou led Chang Liao to White Wolf Hill, where they came upon the\r\ntwo Yüans with Mao Tun and a large force of cavalry. Chang Liao\r\ngalloped to inform his chief and Tsʻao rode up to the top of an\r\neminence to survey the foe. He saw a large mass of cavalry without any\r\nmilitary formation advancing in a disorderly crowd.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “They have no formation, we can easily rout them.”\r\n\r\nThen he handed over his ensign of command to Chang Liao who, with Hsü\r\nChʻu, Yü Chin and Hsü Huang, made a vigorous attack from four different\r\npoints, with the result that the enemy was thrown into confusion. Chang\r\nLiao rode forward and slew Mao Tun and the other captains gave in. The\r\nbrothers Yüan with a few companies of horse got away into Liaotung.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao then led his army into Liuchʻêng. For his services he\r\nconferred upon Tʻien Chʻou the rank of marquis of Liutʻing and put him\r\nover the city. But Tʻien Chʻou declined the rank, saying with tears, “I\r\nam a renegade and a fugitive. It is my good fortune that you spared my\r\nlife and how can I accept a price for Lulung camp? I would rather die\r\nthan accept the marquisate.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao recognised that reason was on his side and conferred upon him\r\nanother office. Tsʻao then pacified the Shanyu chieftains; collected a\r\nlarge number of horses and at once set out on the homeward march.\r\n\r\nThe season was winter, cold and dry. For two hundred li there was no\r\nwater, and grain also was scanty. The troops fed on horse flesh. They\r\nhad to dig very deep, thirty to forty chang, [14] to find water.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao reached Ichou he rewarded those who had remonstrated with\r\nhim against the expedition.\r\n\r\nHe said, “I took some risk in going so far but by good fortune I have\r\nsucceeded; with the aid of Heaven I have secured victory. I could not\r\nbe guided by your advice but still they were counsels of safety and\r\ntherefore I reward you to prove my appreciation of advice and that\r\nhereafter you may not fear to speak your minds.”\r\n\r\nThe adviser, Kuo Chia, did not live to see the return of his lord. His\r\ncoffin was placed on the bier in a hall of the government offices and\r\nTsʻao went thither to sacrifice to his manes. Tsʻao mourned for him,\r\nsaying, “Alas! Heaven has smitten me; Fêng-hsiao is dead.”\r\n\r\nThen turning to his officers he said, “You, gentlemen, are of the same\r\nage as myself, but he was very young to die. I needed him for the\r\nfuture and unhappily he has been torn from me in the flower of his age.\r\nMy heart and my bowels are torn with grief.”\r\n\r\nThe servants of the late adviser presented his last testament, which\r\nthey said his dying hand had written, and he had told them to say, “If\r\nthe Minister shall follow the advice given herein then Liaotung will be\r\nsecure.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao opened the cover and read, nodding his head in agreement and\r\nuttering deep sighs. But no other man knew what was written therein.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Hsiahou Tun at the head of a delegation presented a\r\npetition saying, “For a long time Kungsun Kʻang, the Prefect of\r\nLiaotung, has been contumacious and it bodes ill for peace that the\r\nbrothers Yüan have fled to him. Would it not be well to attack before\r\nthey move against you?”\r\n\r\n“I need not trouble your tiger courage, gentlemen,” said Tsʻao smiling.\r\n“Wait a few days and you will see the heads of our two enemies sent to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThey could not believe it.\r\n\r\nAs has been related the two brothers Yüan escaped to the east with a\r\nfew squadrons of horse. The Prefect of Liaotung was a son of General\r\nKungsun Tu, “the Warlike” as his title ran. He was a native of\r\nHsiangpʻing. When he heard that the Yüans were on their way to his\r\nterritory he called a council to decide upon his plan. At the council\r\nKungsun Kung rose saying, “When Yüan Shao was alive he nourished the\r\nplan of adding this district to his own. Now his sons, homeless, with a\r\nbroken army and no officers, are coming here; it seems to me like the\r\ndove stealing the magpie’s nest. If we offer them shelter they will\r\nassuredly intrigue against us. I advise that they be inveigled into the\r\ncity, put to death and their heads sent to Tsʻao, who will be most\r\ngrateful to us.”\r\n\r\nSaid the Prefect, “I have one fear; Tsʻao will come against us. If so,\r\nit would be better to have the help of the Yüans against him.”\r\n\r\n“Then you can send spies to ascertain whether the army is preparing to\r\nattack us. If it is then save them alive; if not, then follow my\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\nIt was decided to wait till the spies came back. In the meantime the\r\ntwo Yüans had taken counsel together as they approached Liaotung,\r\nsaying, “Liaotung has a large army strong enough to oppose Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\nWe will go thither and submit till we can slay the Prefect and take\r\npossession. Then when we are strong enough we will attack and recover\r\nour own land.”\r\n\r\nWith these intentions they went into the city. They were received and\r\nlodged in the guests’ quarters, but when they wished to see Kungsun\r\nKʻang he put them off with the excuse of indisposition. However, before\r\nmany days the spies returned with the news that Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army was\r\nquiescent and there was no hint of any attack.\r\n\r\nThen Kungsun Kʻang called the Yüans into his presence. But before they\r\ncame he hid swordmen and axemen behind the arras in the hall. When the\r\nvisitors came and had made their salutations, Kʻang bade them be\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nNow it was bitterly cold and on the couch where Shang was sitting were\r\nno coverings. So he asked for a cushion. The host surlily said, “When\r\nyour heads take that long, long journey, will there be any cushions?”\r\n\r\nBefore Shang could recover from his fright Kʻang shouted, “Why do you\r\nnot begin?”\r\n\r\nAt this out rushed the assassins and the heads of the two brothers were\r\ncut off as they sat. Packed in a small wooden box they were sent to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao at Ichou.\r\n\r\nAll this time Tsʻao had been calmly waiting, and when his impatient\r\nofficers had petitioned in a body that he would march to the capital if\r\nhe intended no attack on the east, he told them what he was waiting\r\nfor. He would go as soon as the heads arrived.\r\n\r\nIn their secret hearts they laughed. But then, surely enough, a\r\nmessenger soon came from Liaotung bringing the heads. Then they were\r\ngreatly surprised and when the messenger presented his letters Tsʻao\r\ncried, “Just as Fêng-hsiao said!”\r\n\r\nHe amply rewarded the messenger and the Governor of Liaotung was made a\r\nmarquis and General of the Left Wing; and when the officers asked what\r\nhad happened, Tsʻao told them what the late adviser had predicted. He\r\nread to them the dead officer’s testament, which ran something like\r\nthis:—“Yüan Shang and his brother are going to Liaotung. Illustrious\r\nSir, you are on no account to attack for Kungsun Kʻang has long lived\r\nin fear lest the Yüans should absorb his country. When they arrive\r\nKʻang will hesitate. If you attack, he will save the Yüans to help him;\r\nif you wait, they will work against each other. This is evident.”\r\n\r\nThe officers simply jumped with surprise to see how perfectly events\r\nhad been foreseen.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao at the head of all his officers performed a grand sacrifice\r\nbefore the coffin of the wise Kuo Chia. He had died at the age of\r\nthirty-eight, after eleven years of meritorious and wonderful service\r\nin the wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n        When Heaven permitted Kuo Chia’s birth,\r\n        It made him ablest man on earth.\r\n        He knew by rote all histories,\r\n        From him war kept no mysteries.\r\n        Like Fan’s, his plans were quite decisive,\r\n        As Chʻên’s, his strokes were most incisive.\r\n        Too soon he ran his earthly race,\r\n        Too soon the great beam fell from place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao returned to Chʻichou he sent off the coffin of his late\r\nadviser to the capital where it was interred.\r\n\r\nThen certain of his officers said that as the north had been overcome\r\nit was time to settle Chiangnan. Tsʻao was pleased and said that had\r\nlong occupied his thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe last night he spent in Chʻichou he went to one of the corner towers\r\nand stood there regarding the sky. His only companion was Hsün Yu.\r\nPresently Tsʻao said, “That is a very brilliant glow there in the\r\nsouth. It seems too strong for me to do anything there.”\r\n\r\n“What is there that can oppose your heaven-high prestige?” said Yu.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a beam of golden light shot up out of the earth. “Surely a\r\ntreasure is buried there,” remarked Yu.\r\n\r\nThey went down from the city wall, called some men and led them to the\r\npoint whence the light proceeded. There the men were ordered to dig.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The southern skies with portents glow,\r\n        The northern lands their treasures show.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the diggers found will appear in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nA WOMAN OVERHEARS A SECRET:\r\nA WARRIOR LEAPS A STREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story says that the diggers at the spot whence the golden light\r\nproceeded presently unearthed a bronze bird. Looking at it, Tsʻao\r\nturned to his companion, saying, “What is the portent?”\r\n\r\n“You will remember that Shun’s mother dreamed of a jade bird before his\r\nbirth, so certainly it is a felicitous omen,” said Hsün Yü.\r\n\r\nTsʻao was very pleased and he ordered forthwith the building of a lofty\r\ntower to celebrate the find, and they began to dig foundations and cut\r\ntimber, to burn tiles and to smooth bricks for the Bronze Bird Tower on\r\nthe banks of the Chang River. Tsʻao set a year for the building.\r\n\r\nHis younger son, Chih, said, “If you build a terraced tower you should\r\nadd two others, one on each side. The centre tower and the tallest\r\nshould be called The Bronze Bird Tower; the side towers named Jade\r\nDragon Tower and Golden Phœnix Tower. Then connect these by flying\r\nbridges and the effect will be noble.”\r\n\r\n“My son, your words are very good and by and bye when the building is\r\ncomplete I can solace my old age therein.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao had five sons, but this one Chih was the most clever and\r\nhis essays were particularly elegant. His father was very fond of him\r\nand, seeing that the young man took an interest in the building, Tsʻao\r\nleft him with his brother Pʻei at Yehchün to superintend the work,\r\nwhile he led the army that had recently conquered the Yüans back to the\r\ncapital. When he arrived he distributed rewards liberally and\r\nmemorialised the throne obtaining the title of “The Pure Marquis” for\r\nthe late Kuo Chia. And he took Kuo’s son to be brought up in his own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nNext he began to consider the reduction of Liu Piao’s power. Hsün Yü\r\nsaid, “The Grand Army has only just returned from the north and needs\r\nrest. Wait half a year that the men may recover from the fatigue of the\r\ncampaign and both Liu Piao and Sun Chʻüan will fall at the first roll\r\nof the drums.”\r\n\r\nPresently Tsʻao approved of this plan and to rest his men he assigned\r\ncertain lands to them to till while they rested.\r\n\r\nLiu Piao had been very generous to Liu Pei ever since he had come, a\r\nfugitive seeking shelter. One day at a banquet there came news that two\r\ncaptains, who had tendered their submission, had suddenly begun\r\nplundering the people in Chianghsia. They evidently meant rebellion.\r\n“If they really rebel it will cause a lot of trouble,” said Piao,\r\nrather dismayed.\r\n\r\n“Do not let that trouble you, I will go and settle it,” said Pʻei.\r\n\r\nPleased with this proposal, Piao told off three legions and placed them\r\nunder his friend, and the army marched as soon as the orders were\r\nissued. In a short time it reached the scene and the two malcontents\r\ncame out to fight. Yüan-tê and his two brothers took their stand\r\nbeneath the great banner and looked over at the enemy. The two leaders\r\nwere riding handsome prancing horses and Yüan-tê said, “They certainly\r\nhave fine steeds.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Chao Yün galloped out with his spear set and dashed toward\r\nthe enemy. Chang Wu, one of the leaders, came out to meet him, but the\r\ncombat was very brief for Chang was soon killed. Thereupon Chao Yün\r\nlaid a hand upon the bridle of the fallen man’s horse to lead him back\r\nto his own side. The slain rebel’s companion Chʻên Sun at once rode\r\nafter him, whereupon Chang Fei uttered a loud shout and rode out to\r\nmeet him. With one thrust he slew the rebel. Their followers now\r\nscattered and Yüan-tê speedily restored order and returned.\r\n\r\nLiu Piao, grateful for this service, rode out to the boundary to\r\nwelcome the victors. They re-entered the city and grand banquets were\r\ninstituted, at which they emptied great goblets in congratulations over\r\nthe victory. At one of these banquets the Prefect said, “With such\r\nheroism as my brother has shown Chingchou has one upon whom to rely.\r\nBut a source of sorrow is the south country Yueh, from which a raid may\r\ncome at any time. Chang Lu and Sun Chʻüan are to be feared.”\r\n\r\n“But I have three bold captains,” said Yüan-tê, “quite equal to any\r\ntask you can set them. Send Chang Fei to keep ward on the southern\r\nmarches, Kuan Yü to guard the city against Chang Lu and Chao Yün will\r\nprotect you from Sun Chʻüan. Why need you grieve?”\r\n\r\nThe scheme appealed strongly to the Prefect, but Tsʻai Mao did not\r\napprove. So he spoke to his sister, Liu Piao’s wife, and insisted on\r\nthe danger of putting these men in such commanding positions all round\r\nthe prefecture. The lady Tsʻai, thus influenced by her brother,\r\nundertook to remonstrate and that night began by saying, “The Chingchou\r\nmen seem to have a great liking for Liu Pei; they are always coming and\r\ngoing. You ought to take precautions. I do not think you should let\r\nthem stay in the city. Why not send them on some mission?”\r\n\r\n“Yüan-tê is a good man,” replied the Prefect.\r\n\r\n“I think others differ from you,” said the lady.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect said nothing but muttered to himself. Soon after he went\r\nout of the city to see Yüan-tê and noticed he was riding a very\r\nhandsome horse. They told him it was a prize taken from the recently\r\nconquered rebels, and as he praised it very warmly, the horse was\r\npresented to him. Liu Piao was delighted and rode it back to the city.\r\nKʻuai Yüeh saw it and asked where it had come from. The Prefect told\r\nhim it was a gift from Liu Pʻei and Yüeh said, “My brother knew horses\r\nvery well and I am not a bad judge. This horse has tear-tracks running\r\ndown from his eyes and a white blaze on his forehead. He is called a\r\ntilu and he is a danger to his master. That is why Chang Wu was killed.\r\nI advise you not to ride him.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect began to think. Soon after he asked Yüan-tê to a banquet\r\nand in the course of it said, “You kindly presented me with a horse\r\nlately and I am most grateful, but you may need him on some of your\r\nexpeditions and, if you do not mind, I would like to return him.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê rose and thanked him. The Prefect continued, “You have been\r\nhere a long time and I fear I am spoiling your career as a warrior. Now\r\nHsinyeh in Hsiangjang is no poverty-stricken town; how would you like\r\nto garrison it with your own men?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê naturally took the offer as a command and set out as soon as he\r\ncould, taking leave of the Prefect the next day. And so he took up his\r\nquarters in Hsinyeh. When he left the city he noticed in the gate a\r\nperson making him emphatic salutations and the man presently said, “You\r\nshould not ride that horse.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê looked at the man and recognised in the speaker one of the\r\nsecretaries named I Chi, a native of Shanyang. So he hastily dismounted\r\nand asked why. I Chi replied, “Yesterday I heard that Kʻuai Yüeh told\r\nthe Prefect that that horse was a tilu and brought disaster to its\r\nowner. That is why it was returned to you. How can you mount it again?”\r\n\r\n“I am deeply touched by your affection,” replied Yüan-tê, “but a man’s\r\nlife is governed by fate and what horse can interfere with that?”\r\n\r\nI Chi admitted his superior view, but thereafter he followed Yüan-tê\r\nwherever he went.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Liu Pʻei in Hsinyeh was a matter of rejoicing to all the\r\ninhabitants and the whole administration was reformed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the twelfth year the Lady Kan gave birth to a son who\r\nwas named Chʻan. The night of his birth a crane settled on the roof of\r\nthe house, screeched some forty times and then flew away westward.\r\n\r\nJust at the time of birth a miraculous incense filled the chamber. Lady\r\nKan one night had dreamed that she was looking up at the sky and the\r\nconstellation of the Great Bear, Peitou, had fallen down her throat. As\r\nshe conceived soon after she gave her son the milk-name of O-tou.\r\n\r\nWhile Tsʻao Tsʻao was absent from the capital on his northern\r\nexpedition, Liu Pʻei went to Liu Piao and said to him, “Why do you not\r\ntake this opportunity to march against the capital? An empire might\r\nfollow from that.”\r\n\r\n“I am well placed here,” was the reply, “Why should I attempt other\r\nthings?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said no more. Then the Prefect invited him into the private\r\napartments to drink and while they were so engaged he suddenly began to\r\nsigh despondently.\r\n\r\n“O brother, why do you sigh thus?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“I have a secret sorrow that is difficult to speak about,” said Piao.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was on the point of asking what it was when the Lady Tsʻai came\r\nand stood behind the screen, whereat Piao hung his head and became\r\nsilent. Before long host and guest bade each other farewell and Liu\r\nPʻei went back to his own place.\r\n\r\nThat winter they heard that Tsʻao Tsʻao had returned from Liuchʻêng and\r\nLiu Pʻei sighed when he reflected that his friend had paid no heed to\r\nhis advice.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly a messenger came from the principal city with a request\r\nthat Liu Pʻei would go thither to consult with the Prefect. So he\r\nstarted at once with the messenger. He was received very kindly, and\r\nwhen the salutations were over, the two men went into the private\r\nquarters at the rear to dine. Presently the host said, “Tsʻao has\r\nreturned and he is stronger than ever. I am afraid he means to absorb\r\nthis district. I am sorry I did not follow your advice for I have\r\nmissed an opportunity.”\r\n\r\n“In this period of disruption, with strife on every side, one cannot\r\npretend that there will be no more opportunities. If you only take that\r\nwhat offers there will be nothing to regret.”\r\n\r\n“What you say, brother, is quite to the point,” replied Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nThey drank on for a time till presently Liu Pʻei noticed that his host\r\nwas weeping, and when he asked the cause of these tears, Piao replied,\r\n“It is that secret sorrow I spoke of to you before; I wished to tell\r\nyou, but there was no opportunity that day.”\r\n\r\n“O brother, what difficulty have you, and can I assist you? I am\r\nentirely at your service.”\r\n\r\n“My wife, of the Chʻên family, bore me a son Chʻi, my eldest. He grew\r\nup virtuous but weakly and unfitted to succeed me in my office. Later I\r\ntook a wife of the Tsʻai family, who bore me a son named Tsʻung, fairly\r\nintelligent. If I pass over the elder in favour of the younger there is\r\nthe breach of the rule of primogeniture, and if I follow law and custom\r\nthere are the intrigues of the mother’s family and clan to be reckoned\r\nwith. Further, the army is in the hollow of their hands. There will be\r\ntrouble and I cannot decide what to do.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pʻei said, “All experience proves that to set aside the elder for\r\nthe younger is to take the way of confusion. If you fear the power of\r\nthe Tsʻai faction, then gradually reduce its power and influence, but\r\ndo not let doting affection lead you into making the younger your\r\nheir.”\r\n\r\nPiao agreed. But the Lady Tsʻai had had a suspicion why her lord had\r\nsummoned Liu Pʻei and what was the subject of discussion, so she had\r\ndetermined to listen secretly. She was behind the screen when the\r\nmatter was talked over and she conceived deep resentment against Liu\r\nPʻei for what he had said. On his side he felt that his advice had\r\nfallen upon deaf ears and he arose and walked across the room. As he\r\ndid so he noticed that he was getting heavy and stiff and a furtive\r\ntear stole down his cheek as he thought of the past. When he returned\r\nand sat down his host noticed the traces of weeping and asked the cause\r\nof his sorrow.\r\n\r\n“In the past I was always in the saddle and I was slender and lithe.\r\nNow it is so long since I rode that I am getting stout and the days and\r\nmonths are slipping by, wasted; I shall have old age on me in no time\r\nand I have accomplished nothing. So I am sad.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard a story that when you were at Hsucheng at the season of\r\ngreen plums you and Tsʻao Tsʻao were discussing heroes. You mentioned\r\nthis name and that to him as men of parts and he rejected every one of\r\nthem. Finally he said that you and he were the only two men of real\r\nworth in the whole country. If he with all his power and authority did\r\nnot dare to place himself in front of you, I do not think you need\r\ngrieve about having accomplished nothing.”\r\n\r\nAt this flattering speech Liu Pʻei pretended that the wine was getting\r\nthe better of him and in a half maudlin manner he replied, “If I only\r\nhad a starting point then I would not trouble about any one in a\r\nworldful of fools.”\r\n\r\nHis host said no more and the guest, feeling that he had slipped up in\r\nspeech, rose as if drunk, took leave and staggered out saying he must\r\nreturn to his lodging to recover.\r\n\r\nThe episode has been celebrated in a poem:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        When with crooking fingers counting,\r\n        Tsʻao Tsʻao reckoned up the forceful\r\n        Men of real determination,\r\n        Only two he found; and one was\r\n        Yüan-tê. But by inaction\r\n        He had grown both fat and slothful;\r\n        Yet the months and years in passing\r\n        Fretted him with nought accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Liu Piao kept silence when he heard the words of Yüan-tê, yet he\r\nfelt the more uneasy. After the departure of his guest he retired into\r\nthe inner quarters where he met his wife. The Lady Tsʻai said, “I\r\nhappened to be behind the screen just now and so heard the words of Liu\r\nPʻei. They betray scant regard for other people and mean that he would\r\ntake your country if he could. If you do not remove him it will go ill\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\nHer husband made no reply, but only shook his head. Then the Lady Tsʻai\r\ntook counsel with her kinsman Tsʻai Mao, who said, “Let me go to the\r\nguest-house and slay him forthwith, and we can report what we have\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nHis sister consented and he went out, and that night told off a party\r\nof soldiers to do the foul deed.\r\n\r\nNow Yüan-tê sat in his lodging by the light of a single candle till\r\nabout the third watch, when he prepared to retire to bed. He was\r\nstartled by a knock at his door and in came I Chi, who had heard of the\r\nplot against his new master and had come in the darkness to warn him.\r\nHe related the details of the plot and urged speedy departure.\r\n\r\n“I have not said farewell to my host; how can I go away?” said Liu\r\nPʻei.\r\n\r\n“If you go to bid him farewell you will fall a victim to the Tsʻai\r\nfaction,” said I Chi.\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê said a hasty good-bye to his friend, called up his escort\r\nand they all mounted and rode away by the light of the stars toward\r\nHsinyeh. Soon after they had left the soldiers arrived at the\r\nguest-house, but their intended victim was already well on his way.\r\n\r\nNaturally the failure of the plot chagrined the treacherous Tsʻai Mao,\r\nbut he took the occasion to scribble some calumnious verses on one of\r\nthe partitions. Then he went to see Liu Piao to whom he said, “Liu Pʻei\r\nhas treacherous intentions, as can be seen from some lines written on\r\nthe wall. And his hurried departure is suspicious.”\r\n\r\nLiu Piao felt doubtful, but he went to the guest-house and there on the\r\nwall he read this poem:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Too long, far too long I have dreamed life away,\r\n    Gazing at scenery day after day.\r\n    A dragon can never be kept in a pond,\r\n    He should ride on the thunder to heaven and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreatly angered by what he read, Liu Piao drew his sword and swore to\r\nslay the writer. But before he had gone many paces his anger had\r\nalready died down and he said to himself, “I have seen much of the man,\r\nbut have never known him write verses. This is the handiwork of some\r\none who wishes to sow discord between us.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he turned back and with the point of his sword scraped away\r\nthe poem. Then, putting up his sword, he mounted and rode home. By and\r\nbye Tsʻai Mao reminded him that the soldiers were awaiting orders and\r\nasked whether they could go to Hsinyeh and arrest Liu Pʻei.\r\n\r\n“There is no hurry,” he replied.\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao saw his brother-in-law’s hesitation and again sought his\r\nsister. She said, “Soon there is to be the great gathering at\r\nHsiangyang and we can arrange something for that day.”\r\n\r\nNext day Tsʻai Mao petitioned the Prefect, saying, “I pray you, Sir, to\r\nattend the Full Harvest Festival at Hsiangyang; it would be an\r\nencouragement to the people.”\r\n\r\n“I have been feeling my old trouble lately; I certainly cannot go,”\r\nreplied he, “but my two sons can go to represent me and receive the\r\nguests.”\r\n\r\n“They are full young,” replied Mao, “They may make some mistakes.”\r\n\r\n“Then go to Hsinyeh and request Liu Pʻei to receive the guests,” said\r\nPiao.\r\n\r\nNothing could have pleased Tsʻai Mao more, for this would bring Liu\r\nPʻei within reach of his plot. Without loss of time he sent to Yüan-tê\r\nrequesting him to go to preside at the Festival.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Yüan-tê made the best of his way home to Hsinyeh.\r\nHe felt that he had offended by that slip in speech, but determined to\r\nkeep silence about it and attempt no explanation. So he discussed it\r\nwith nobody. Then came the message asking him to preside at the\r\nFestival, and he needed counsel.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien said, “You have seemed worried and preoccupied lately and I\r\nthink something untoward happened at Chingchou. You should consider\r\nwell before you accept this invitation.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Yüan-tê told his confidants the whole story.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü said, “You yourself think your speech offended the Prefect, but\r\nhe said nothing to show displeasure. You need pay no attention to the\r\nbabble of outsiders. Hsiangyang is quite near and, if you do not go,\r\nLiu Chinchou will begin to suspect something really is wrong.”\r\n\r\n“You speak well,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSaid Chang Fei, “Banquets are no good; gatherings are no better; it is\r\nbest not to go.”\r\n\r\n“Let me take three hundred horse and foot as escort; there will be no\r\ntrouble then,” said Chao Yün.\r\n\r\n“That is the best course,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nThey soon set out for the gathering place and Tsʻai Mao met them at the\r\nboundary and was most affable and courteous. Soon arrived the Prefect’s\r\nsons at the head of a great company of officers, civil and military.\r\nTheir appearance put Yüan-tê more at ease. He was conducted to the\r\nguest-house and Chao Yün posted his men so as to guard it completely,\r\nwhile he himself, armed, remained close to his chief.\r\n\r\nLiu Chʻi said to Yüan-tê, “My father is feeling unwell and could not\r\ncome, wherefore he begs you, Uncle Liu, to preside at the various\r\nceremonies and conduct the inspections.”\r\n\r\n“Really I am unfit for such responsibilities,” said Yüan-tê, “But my\r\nbrother’s command must be obeyed.”\r\n\r\nNext day it was reported that the officials from the forty-one\r\ndepartments of the nine districts had all arrived.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻai Mao said to Kʻuai Yüeh, “This Liu Pʻei is the villain of the\r\nage and if left alive will certainly work harm to us. He must be got\r\nrid of now.”\r\n\r\n“I fear you would forfeit everybody’s favour if you harmed him,”\r\nreplied Kʻuai.\r\n\r\n“I have already secretly spoken in these terms to Prefect Liu,” said\r\nTsʻai, “and I have his word here.”\r\n\r\n“So it may be regarded as settled; then we can prepare.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao said, “One of my brothers is posted on the road to the Hsien\r\nHills from the east gate and the others are on the north and south\r\nroads. No guard is needed on the west as the Tʻan Torrent is quite\r\nsafeguard enough. Even with legions he could not get over that.”\r\n\r\nKʻuai replied, “I notice that Chao Yün never leaves him. I feel sure he\r\nexpects some attack.”\r\n\r\n“I have placed five hundred men in ambush in the city.”\r\n\r\n“We will tell Wên Pʻing and Wang Wei to invite all the military\r\nofficers to a banquet at one of the pavilions outside the city, and\r\nChao Yün will be among them. Then will be our opportunity.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao thought this a good device for getting Chao Yün out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNow oxen and horses had been slaughtered and a grand banquet prepared.\r\nYüan-tê rode to the residence on the horse of ill omen and when he\r\narrived the steed was led into the back part of the enclosure and\r\ntethered there. Soon the guests arrived and Yüan-tê took his place as\r\nmaster of the feast, with the two sons of the Prefect, one on each\r\nside. The guests were all arranged in order of rank. Chao Yün stood\r\nnear his lord sword in hand as a faithful henchman should do.\r\n\r\nThen Wên and Wang came to invite Chao Yün to the banquet they had\r\nprepared for the military officers. But he declined. However, Yüan-tê\r\ntold him to go, and, after some demur, he went. Then Tsʻai Mao\r\nperfected his final arrangements, placing his men surrounding the place\r\nlike a ring of iron. The three hundred guards that formed the escort of\r\nYüan-tê were sent away to the guest-house.\r\n\r\nAll were ready and awaiting the signal. At the third course, I Chi took\r\na goblet of wine in his hands and approached Yüan-tê, at the same time\r\ngiving him a meaning look. Then in a low voice he said, “Make an excuse\r\nto get away.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê understood and presently rose as if stiff with long sitting and\r\nwent outside. There he found I Chi, who had gone thither after\r\npresenting the cup of wine. I Chi then told him more of the plot and\r\nthat all the roads were guarded except that to the west. And he advised\r\nhim to lose no time.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was quite taken aback. However, he got hold of the horse of ill\r\nomen, opened the door of the garden and led him out. Then he took a\r\nflying leap into the saddle and galloped off without waiting for the\r\nescort. He made for the west gate. At the gate the wardens wanted to\r\nquestion him, but he only whipped up his steed and rode through. The\r\nguards at the gate ran off to report to Tsʻai Mao, who quickly went in\r\npursuit with a half company of soldiers.\r\n\r\nAs has been said Yüan-tê burst out at the west gate. Before he had gone\r\nfar there rolled before him a great river barring the way. It was the\r\nTʻan, many score feet in width, which pours its waters into the Hsiang.\r\nIts current was very swift.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê reached the bank and saw the river was unfordable. So he turned\r\nhis horse and rode back. Then, not far off, he saw a cloud of dust and\r\nknew that his pursuers were therein. He thought that it was all over.\r\nHowever, he turned again toward the swift river, and seeing the\r\nsoldiers now quite near, plunged into the stream. A few paces, and he\r\nfelt the horse’s fore legs floundering in front while the water rose\r\nover the skirt of his robe. Then he plied the whip furiously, crying,\r\n“Tilu, Tilu, I trust to you.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon the good steed suddenly reared up out of the water and, with\r\none tremendous leap, was on the western bank. Yüan-tê felt as if he had\r\ncome out of the clouds.\r\n\r\nIn after years the famous court official, Su Tʻung-pʻo, wrote a poem on\r\nthis leap over the Tʻan Torrent:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        I’m growing old, the leaves are sere,\r\n        My sun slopes westward, soon will sink,\r\n        And I recall that yester year\r\n        I wandered by Tʻan River brink.\r\n\r\n        Irresolute, anon I paused,\r\n        Anon advanced, and gazed around,\r\n        I marked the autumn’s reddened leaves,\r\n        And watched them eddying to the ground\r\n\r\n        I thought of all the mighty deeds\r\n        Of him who set the House of Han\r\n        On high, and all the struggles since,\r\n        The battlefields, the blood that ran.\r\n\r\n        I saw the nobles gathered round\r\n        The board, set in the Banquet Hall;\r\n        Amid them, one, above whose head\r\n        There hung a sword about to fall.\r\n\r\n        I saw him quit that festive throng\r\n        And westward ride, a lonely way;\r\n        I saw a squadron follow swift,\r\n        Intent the fugitive to slay.\r\n\r\n        I saw him reach the River Tʻan,\r\n        Whose swirling current rushes by;\r\n        Adown the bank he galloped fast,\r\n        “Now leap, my steed!” I heard him cry.\r\n\r\n        His steed’s hoofs churn the swollen stream;\r\n        What recks he that the waves run high?\r\n        He hears the sound of clashing steel,\r\n        Of thundering squadrons coming nigh.\r\n\r\n        And upward from the foaming waves\r\n        I saw two peerless beings soar;\r\n        One was a destined western king,\r\n        And him another dragon bore.\r\n\r\n        The Tʻan still rolls from east to west,\r\n        Its roaring torrent ne’er dry.\r\n        Those dragons twain, Ah! where are they?\r\n        Yes, where? But there is no reply.\r\n\r\n        The setting sun, in dark relief\r\n        Against the glowing western sky,\r\n        Throws out the everlasting hills\r\n        While, saddened, here I stand and sigh.\r\n\r\n        Men died to found the kingdoms three,\r\n        Which now as misty dreams remain.\r\n        Of greatest deeds the traces oft\r\n        Are faint that fleeting years retain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Liu Pʻei crossed the rolling river. Then he turned and looked back\r\nat the other bank which his pursuers had just gained.\r\n\r\n“Why did you run away from the feast?” called out Tsʻai Mao.\r\n\r\n“Why did you wish to harm one who has done you no injury?” replied\r\nYüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“I have never thought of such a thing; do not listen to what people say\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nBut Yüan-tê saw that his enemy was fitting an arrow to his bowstring,\r\nso he whipped up his steed and rode away south-west.\r\n\r\n“What spirits aided him?” said Tsʻai Mao to his followers.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to go back to the city, but in the gate he saw Chao Yün\r\ncoming out at the head of his company of guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n    By wondrous leap the dragon steed his rider’s life could save.\r\n    Now follows him, on vengeance bent, his master’s henchman brave.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next chapters will tell what fate befell the traitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nYÜAN-TÊ MEETS A RECLUSE AT NANCHANG:\r\nTAN FU MEETS A NOBLE LORD AT HSINYEH.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Tsʻai Mao was going into the city he met Chao Yün and his three\r\nhundred coming out. It had happened that, while at the banquet, Chao\r\nYün had noticed some movement of men and horses and had at once gone to\r\nthe banquet-hall to see if all was well with his lord. Missing him from\r\nhis place he had become anxious and gone to the guest-house. There he\r\nheard that Tsʻai Mao had gone off to the west gate with troops. So he\r\nquickly took his spear, mounted and went, he and the escort, in hot\r\nhaste along the same road. Meeting Tsʻai Mao near the gate he said,\r\n“Where is my lord?”\r\n\r\n“He left the banquet-hall quite suddenly and I know not whither he has\r\ngone,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nNow Chao Yün was cautious and careful and had no desire to act hastily,\r\nso he urged his horse forward till he came to the river. There he was\r\nchecked by a torrent without ford or bridge. At once he turned back and\r\nshouted after Tsʻai Mao, “You invited my lord to a feast; what means\r\nthis going after him with a squadron of horse?”\r\n\r\nMao replied, “It is my duty to guard the officials who have assembled\r\nhere as I am the chief captain.”\r\n\r\n“Whither have you driven my lord?” asked Chao.\r\n\r\n“They tell me he rode quite alone out through the west gate, but I have\r\nnot seen him.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün was anxious and doubtful. Again he rode to the river and\r\nlooked around. This time he noticed a wet track on the farther side. He\r\nthought to himself that it was almost an impossible crossing for a man\r\nand a horse, so he ordered his men to scatter and search. But they also\r\ncould find no trace of Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nChao Yün turned again to the city. By the time he had reached the wall\r\nTsʻai Mao had gone within. He then questioned the gate wardens, and\r\nthey all agreed in saying that Liu Pei had ridden out at full gallop.\r\nThat was all they knew. Fearing to re-enter the city lest he should\r\nfall into an ambush, Chao started for Hsinyeh.\r\n\r\nAfter that marvellous life-saving leap over the torrent, Yüan-tê felt\r\nelated but rather dazed. He could not help feeling that his safety was\r\ndue to an especial interposition of Providence. Following a tortuous\r\npath, he urged his steed toward Nanchang. But the sun sank to the west\r\nand his destination seemed yet a long way off. Then he saw a young\r\ncowherd seated on the back of a buffalo and playing on a short pipe.\r\n\r\n“If I were only as happy!” sighed Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nHe checked his horse and looked at the lad, who stopped his beast,\r\nceased playing on the pipe and stared fixedly at the stranger.\r\n\r\n“You must be Yüan-tê, the General who fought the Yellow Turbans,” said\r\nthe boy presently.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was taken aback.\r\n\r\n“How can you know my name, a young rustic like you living in such a\r\nsecluded place?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Of course I do not know you, but my master often has visitors and they\r\nall talk about Yüan-tê, the tall man whose hands hang down below his\r\nknees and whose eyes are very prominent. They say he is the most famous\r\nman of the day. Now you, General, are just such a man as they talk\r\nabout, and surely you are he.”\r\n\r\n“Well, who is your master?”\r\n\r\n“My master’s name is Ssŭma, a compound surname, and his ming is Hui;\r\nhis other name is Tê-tsʻao. He belongs to Yingchou and his Taoist\r\nappellation is Shui-ching, ‘The Water-mirror.’”\r\n\r\n“Who are your master’s friends that you mentioned?”\r\n\r\n“They are Pʻang Tê-kung and Pʻang Tʻung of Hsiangyang.”\r\n\r\n“And who are they?”\r\n\r\n“Relatives. Pʻang Tê-kung is ten years older than my master; the other\r\nis five years younger. One day my master was up in a tree picking\r\nmulberries when Pʻang Tʻung arrived. They began to talk and kept it up\r\nall day, my master did not come down till the evening. My master is\r\nvery fond of Pʻang Tʻung and calls him brother.”\r\n\r\n“And where does your master live?”\r\n\r\n“In that wood there, in front,” said the cowherd pointing to it. “There\r\nhe has a farmstead.”\r\n\r\n“I really am Liu Yüan-tê and you might lead me to your master that I\r\nmay salute him.”\r\n\r\nThe cowherd led the way for about two li, when Liu Pei found himself in\r\nfront of a farm house. He dismounted and went to the centre door.\r\nSuddenly came to his ear the sound of a lute most skilfully played and\r\nthe air was extremely beautiful. He stopped his guide and would not\r\nallow him to announce a visitor, but stood there rapt by the melody.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the music ceased. He heard a deep laugh and a man appeared,\r\nsaying, “Amidst the clear and subtle sounds of the lute there suddenly\r\nrang out a high note as though some noble man was near.”\r\n\r\n“That is my master,” said the lad pointing.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei saw before him a tall figure, slender and straight as a pine\r\ntree, a very “chosen vessel.” Hastening forward he saluted. The skirt\r\nof his robe was still wet from the river.\r\n\r\n“You have escaped from a grave danger to-day, Sir,” said\r\n“Water-mirror.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was startled into silence, and the cowherd said to his master,\r\n“This is Liu Yüan-tê.”\r\n\r\n“Water-mirror” asked him to enter and when they were seated in their\r\nrelative positions as host and guest, Yüan-tê glanced round the room.\r\nUpon the bookshelves were piled books and manuscripts. The window\r\nopened upon an exquisite picture of pines and bamboos and a lute lay\r\nupon a stone couch. The room showed refinement in its last degree.\r\n\r\n“Whence come you, illustrious Sir?” asked the host.\r\n\r\n“By chance I was passing this way and the lad pointed you out to me. So\r\nI came to bow in your honoured presence. I cannot tell what pleasure it\r\ngives me.”\r\n\r\n“Water-mirror” laughed. “Why this mystery? Why must you conceal the\r\ntruth? You have certainly just escaped from a grave danger.”\r\n\r\nThen the story of the banquet and the flight was told.\r\n\r\n“I knew it all from your appearance,” said his host. “Your name has\r\nlong been familiar,” continued he, “but whence comes it that, up to the\r\npresent, you are only a homeless devil?”\r\n\r\n“I have suffered many a check during my life,” said Liu Pei, “and\r\nthrough one of them am I here now.”\r\n\r\n“It should not be so; but the reason is that you still lack the one man\r\nto aid you.”\r\n\r\n“I am simple enough in myself, I know; but I have Sun Chʻien, Mi Chu\r\nand Chien Yung on the civil side, and for warriors I have Kuan Yü,\r\nChang Fei and Chao Yün. These are all most loyal helpers and I depend\r\nupon them not a little.”\r\n\r\n“Your fighting men are good: fit to oppose a legion. The pity is you\r\nhave no really able adviser. Your civilians are but pallid students of\r\nbooks, not men fitted to weave and control destiny.”\r\n\r\n“I have always yearned to find one of those marvellous recluses who\r\nlive among the hills till their day arrive. So far I have sought in\r\nvain.”\r\n\r\n“You know what the Master said, ‘In a hamlet of ten households there\r\nmust be one true man.’ Can you say there is no man?”\r\n\r\n“I am simple and uninstructed; I pray you enlighten me.”\r\n\r\n“You have heard what the street boys sing:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        In eight and nine begins decay,\r\n            Four years, then comes the fateful day,\r\n        When destiny will show the way,\r\n            And the dragon flies out of the mire O!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis song was first heard when the new reign-style was adopted. The\r\nfirst line was fulfilled when Liu Piao lost his first wife, and when\r\nhis family troubles began. The next line relates to the approaching\r\ndeath of Liu Piao and there is not a single man among all his crowd of\r\nofficers who has the least ability. The last two lines will be\r\nfulfilled in you, General.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê started up in surprise, crying, “How could such a thing be?”\r\n\r\n“Water-mirror” continued, “At this moment the marvellously clever ones\r\nof all the earth are all here and you, Sir, ought to seek them.”\r\n\r\n“Where are they? Who are they?” said Yüan-tê quickly.\r\n\r\n“If you could find either Fu-lung (Hidden Dragon) or Fêng-chʻu (Phoenix\r\nFledgeling), you could restore order in the Empire.”\r\n\r\n“But who are these men?”\r\n\r\nHis host clapped his hands, smiled and said, “Good; very good.”\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê persisted and pressed home his questions “Water-mirror”\r\nsaid, “It is getting late. You might stay the night here, General, and\r\nwe will talk over these things to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHe called to a lad to bring wine and food for his guest and his horse\r\nwas taken to the stable and fed. After Yüan-tê had eaten he was shown\r\nto a chamber opening off the main room and went to bed. But the words\r\nof his host would not be banished and he lay there only dozing till far\r\ninto the night.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he became fully awake at the sound of a knock at the door and\r\na person entering. And he heard his host say “Where are you from,\r\nYüan-chih?”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei rose from his couch and listened secretly. He heard the man\r\nreply, “It has long been said that Liu Piao treated good men as good\r\nmen should be treated and bad men as they should be treated. So I went\r\nto see for myself. But that reputation is undeserved. He does treat\r\ngood men correctly but he cannot use them, and he treats wicked men in\r\nthe right way, all but dismissing them. So I left a letter for him and\r\ncame away; and here I am.”\r\n\r\n“Water-mirror” replied, “You, capable enough to be the adviser of a\r\nking, ought to be able to find some one fit to serve. Why did you\r\ncheapen yourself so far as to go to Liu Piao? Beside there is a real\r\nhero right under your eyes and you do not know him.”\r\n\r\n“It is just as you say,” replied the stranger.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei listened with great joy for he thought this visitor was\r\ncertainly one of the two he was advised to look for. He would have\r\nshown himself then and there, but he thought that would look strange.\r\nSo he waited till daylight, when he sought out his host and said, “Who\r\nwas it came last night?”\r\n\r\n“A friend of mine,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê begged for an introduction. “Water-mirror” said, “He wants to\r\nfind an enlightened master and so he has gone elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nWhen the guest asked his name his host only replied, “Good, good.” And\r\nwhen he asked who they were who went by the names of Fu-lung and\r\nFêng-chʻu he only elicited the same reply.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê then, bowing low before his host, begged him to leave the hills\r\nand help him to bring about the restoration of the ruling house to its\r\nprerogatives. But he replied, “Men of the hills and deserts are unequal\r\nto such a task. However, there must be many far abler than I who will\r\nhelp you if you seek them.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking they heard outside the farm the shouts of men\r\nand neighing of horses, and a servant came in to say that a captain\r\nwith a large company of men had arrived. Yüan-tê went out hastily to\r\nsee who these were and found Chao Yün. He was much relieved and Chao\r\ndismounted and entered the house.\r\n\r\n“Last night, on my return to our city,” said Chao, “I could not find my\r\nlord, so I followed at once and traced you here. I pray you return\r\nquickly as I fear an attack on the city.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê took leave of his host and the whole company returned to\r\nHsinyeh. Before they had gone far another troop appeared, and, when\r\nthey had come nearer, they saw the two brothers. They met with great\r\njoy and Yüan-tê told them of the wonderful leap his horse had made over\r\nthe torrent. All expressed surprise and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the city a council was called and Chao Yün\r\nsaid, “You ought first of all to indite a letter to Liu Piao telling\r\nhim all these things.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was prepared and Sun Chʻien bore it to the seat of\r\ngovernment. He was received, and Liu Piao at once asked the reason of\r\nYüan-tê’s hasty flight from the festival. Whereupon the letter was\r\npresented and the bearer related the machinations of Tsʻai Mao and told\r\nof the escape and the amazing leap over the torrent. Liu Piao was very\r\nangry, sent for Tsʻai Mao and berated him soundly, saying, “How dare\r\nyou try to hurt my brother?” and he ordered him out to execution.\r\n\r\nLiu Piao’s wife, Tsʻai Mao’s sister, prayed for a remission of the\r\ndeath penalty, but Liu Piao refused to be appeased. Then spoke Sun\r\nChʻien, saying, “If you put Tsʻai to death, I fear Uncle Liu will be\r\nunable to remain here.”\r\n\r\nThen he was reprieved, but dismissed with a severe reprimand.\r\n\r\nLiu Piao sent his elder son back with Sun Chʻien to apologise. When\r\nChʻi reached Hsinyeh, Yüan-tê welcomed him and gave a banquet in his\r\nhonour. After some little drinking, the chief guest suddenly began to\r\nweep and presently said, “My stepmother always cherishes a wish to put\r\nme out of the way, and I do not know how to avoid her anger. Could you\r\nadvise me, Uncle?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê exhorted him to be careful and perfectly filial and nothing\r\ncould happen. Soon after the young man took his leave, and wept at\r\nparting. Yüan-tê escorted him well on his way and, pointing to his\r\nsteed, said, “I owe my life to this horse: had it not been for him I\r\nhad been already below the Springs.”\r\n\r\n“It was not the strength of the horse, but your noble fortune, Uncle.”\r\n\r\nThey parted, the young man weeping bitterly. On re-entering the city\r\nYüan-tê met a person in the street wearing a hempen turban, a cotton\r\nrobe confined by a black girdle, and black shoes. He came along singing\r\na song.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The universe is riven, alack! now nears the end of all,\r\n    The noble mansion quakes, alack! what beam can stay the fall?\r\n    A wise one waits his lord, alack! but hidden in the glen,\r\n    The seeker knows not him, alack! nor me, of common men.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan-tê listened. “Surely this is one of the men ‘Water-mirror’ spoke\r\nof,” thought he.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted, spoke to the singer and invited him into his residence.\r\nThen when they were seated he asked the stranger’s name.\r\n\r\n“I am from Yingshang and my name is Tan Fu. I have known you by repute\r\nfor a long time and they said you appreciated men of ability. I wanted\r\nto come to you but every way of getting an introduction seemed closed.\r\nSo I bethought me of attracting your notice by singing that song in the\r\nmarket place.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê thought he had found a treasure and treated the newcomer with\r\nthe greatest kindness. Then Tan Fu spoke of the horse that he had seen\r\nYüan-tê riding and asked to look at him. So the animal was brought\r\nround.\r\n\r\n“Is not this a tilu?” said Tan Fu. “But though he is a good steed he\r\nrisks his master. You must not ride him.”\r\n\r\n“He has already fulfilled the omens,” said Yüan-tê, and he related the\r\nstory of the leap over the torrent.\r\n\r\n“But this was saving his master, not risking him; he will surely harm\r\nsome one in the end. But I can tell you how to avert the omen.”\r\n\r\n“I should be glad to hear it,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“If you have an enemy against whom you bear a grudge, give him this\r\nhorse and wait till he has fulfilled the evil omens on this man: then\r\nyou can ride him in safety.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê changed colour. “What, Sir! You are but a new acquaintance and\r\nyou would advise me to take an evil course and to harm another for my\r\nown advantage? No, Sir! I cannot listen.”\r\n\r\nHis guest smiled. “People said you were virtuous. I could not ask you\r\ndirectly, so I put it that way to test you.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê’s expression changed. He rose and returned the compliment,\r\nsaying, “But how can I be virtuous while I lack your teaching?”\r\n\r\n“When I came here, I heard the people saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Since Liu came here, O blessed day!\r\n        We’ve had good luck: long may he stay!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you see the effects of your virtue extend to the ordinary people.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Tan Fu was made Organiser in Chief of the army.\r\n\r\nThe one idea that held Tsʻao Tsʻao after his return from Chʻichou was\r\nthe capture of Chingchou. He sent Tsʻao Jên and Li Tien, with the two\r\nbrothers Lü who had surrendered, to camp at Fanchʻêng with three\r\nlegions and so threaten Chingchou and Hsiangyang. Thence he sent spies\r\nto find out the weak points.\r\n\r\nThen the two Lüs petitioned Tsʻao Jên saying, “Liu Pei is strengthening\r\nhis position at Hsinyeh and laying in large supplies. Some great scheme\r\nis afoot and he should be checked. Since our surrender we have\r\nperformed no noteworthy service and, if you will give us half a legion,\r\nwe promise to bring you the head of Liu Pei.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên was only too glad, and the expedition set out. The scouts\r\nreported this to Yüan-tê who turned to Tan Fu for advice.\r\n\r\nTan Fu said, “They must not be permitted to cross the boundary. Send\r\nyour two brothers right and left, one to attack the enemy on the march,\r\nthe other to cut off the retreat. You and Chao Yün will make a front\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\nThe two brothers started and then Yüan-tê went out at the gate with\r\nthree companies to oppose the enemy. Before they had gone far they saw\r\na great cloud of dust behind the hills. This marked the approach of the\r\nbrothers Lü. Presently, both sides being arrayed, Yüan-tê rode out and\r\nstood by his standard. He called out, “Who are you who thus would\r\nencroach on my territory?”\r\n\r\n“I am the great general Lü Kʻuang, and I have the orders of the\r\nminister to make you prisoner,” said the leader.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê ordered Chao Yün to go out, and the two captains engaged. Very\r\nsoon Chao had disposed of his opponent and Yüan-tê gave the signal to\r\nattack. Lü Hsiang could not maintain his position and led his men off.\r\nSoon his men found themselves attacked by an army rushing in from the\r\nside led by Kuan Yü. The loss was more than a half and the remainder\r\nfled for safety.\r\n\r\nAbout ten li farther on they found their retreat barred by an army\r\nunder Chang Fei, who stood in the way with a long spear ready to\r\nthrust. Crying out who he was, he bore down upon Lü Hsiang, who was\r\nslain without a chance of striking a blow. The men again fled in\r\ndisorder. They were pursued by Yüan-tê and the greater part killed or\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê returned into his own city where he rewarded Tan Fu and\r\nfeasted his victorious soldiers. Some of the defeated men took the news\r\nof the deaths of the leaders and the capture of their comrades to Tsʻao\r\nJên.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên, much distressed, consulted his colleague who advised staying\r\nwhere they were and holding on till reinforcements could arrive.\r\n\r\n“Not so,” said Tsʻao Jên. “We cannot support calmly the death of two\r\nleaders and the loss of so many men. We must avenge them quickly.\r\nHsinyeh is but a crossbow slug of a place and not worth disturbing the\r\nMinister for.”\r\n\r\n“Liu Pei is a man of metal,” said Li Tien. “Do not esteem him lightly.”\r\n\r\n“What are you afraid of?” said Jên.\r\n\r\n“The Rule of War says ‘To know your enemy and yourself is the secret of\r\nvictory,’” replied Tien. “I am not afraid of the battle, but I do not\r\nthink we can conquer.”\r\n\r\n“You are a traitor!” cried Jên angrily. “Then I will capture Liu Pei\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“Do so; and I will guard this city,” said Tien.\r\n\r\n“If you do not go with me, it is a proof that you are a traitor,”\r\nretorted Tsʻao Jên.\r\n\r\nAt this reproach, Li Tien felt constrained to join the expedition. So\r\nthey told off two and a half legions with which they crossed the river\r\nfor Hsinyeh.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The officers all keenly felt the shame of many slain,\r\n    The Chief determines on revenge and marches out again.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat measure of success the expedition met with will be related in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF FANCHʻÊNG:\r\nCHUKO LIANG RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn hot anger, Tsʻao Jên lost no time in marching out to avenge the loss\r\nof so many of his army. He hastily crossed the river to attack Hsinyeh\r\nand trample it in the dust.\r\n\r\nWhen Tan Fu got back into the city he said to his master, “When Tsʻao\r\nJên, now at Fanchʻêng, hears of his losses, he will try to retrieve\r\nthem and will come to attack us.”\r\n\r\n“What is the counter move?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“As he will come with all his force his own city will be left\r\nundefended; we will surprise it.”\r\n\r\n“By what ruse?”\r\n\r\nThe adviser leaned over and whispered to his chief. Whatever the plan\r\nwas it pleased Yüan-tê, who made arrangements. Soon the scouts reported\r\nTsʻao Jên crossing the river with a mighty host.\r\n\r\n“Just as I guessed,” said Tan Fu, hearing of it.\r\n\r\nThen he suggested that Yüan-tê should lead out one army against the\r\ninvaders. He did so, and, when the formation was complete, Chao Yün\r\nrode to the front as champion and challenged the other side.\r\n\r\nLi Tien rode out and engaged. At about the tenth bout Li Tien found he\r\nwas losing and retired toward his own side. Chao Yün pressed after him,\r\nbut was checked by a heavy discharge of arrows from the wings. Then\r\nboth sides stopped the battle and retired to their camps.\r\n\r\nLi Tien reported to his chief that their opponents were brave, very\r\nfull of spirit, and that they would be hard to overcome and advised a\r\nretreat on Fanchʻêng.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên angrily replied, “You damped the men’s spirits before we\r\nstarted, and now you betray us. You have been bought and you deserve\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nHe called in the executioners and they led away their victim. But the\r\nother officers came to intercede and Tien was spared. However, he was\r\ntransferred to the command of the rear, while Tsʻao Jên himself led the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nNext day the drums beat an advance and Tsʻao Jên, having drawn up his\r\nmen, sent a messenger over to ask if his opponent recognised his plan\r\nof array. So Tan Fu went on a hill and looked over it. Then he said to\r\nLiu Pei “The arrangement is called ‘The Eight Docked Gates,’ and each\r\n‘gate’ has a name. If you enter by one of the three named ‘Birth,’\r\n‘Bellevue’ and ‘Expanse’ you succeed; if by one of the ‘gates’\r\n‘Wounds,’ ‘Fear,’ or ‘Annihilation,’ you sustain injuries. The other\r\ntwo ‘gates’ are named ‘Obstacles’ and ‘Death,’ and to enter them means\r\nthe end. Now, though the eight ‘gates’ are all there quite correct, the\r\ncentral ‘key-post’ is lacking and the formation can be thrown into\r\nconfusion by entry from the south-east and exit due west.”\r\n\r\nWherefore certain orders were issued and Chao Yün, leading half a\r\ncompany, rode out on his prancing steed to break the array. He burst\r\nin, as directed, at the south-east and, with great clamour and\r\nfighting, reached the centre. Tsʻao Jên made for the north, but Chao\r\nYün, instead of following him, made a dash westward and got through.\r\nThence he turned round to the south-east again and smote till Tsʻao\r\nJên’s army was in disarray. A general advance was signalled and the\r\ndefeat was severe. The beaten enemy retired.\r\n\r\nTan Fu forbade pursuit and they returned.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the battle convinced Tsʻao Jên of the wisdom of his\r\ncolleague and he sent for him to consult.\r\n\r\n“They certainly have some very able person in Liu Pei’s army since my\r\nformation was so quickly broken,” said Tsʻao Jên.\r\n\r\n“My chief anxiety is about Fanchʻêng,” said Li Tien.\r\n\r\n“I will raid their camp this night,” said Jên. “If I succeed we will\r\ndecide upon what should be done next. If I fail, we will return to\r\nFanchʻêng.”\r\n\r\n“The camp will be well prepared against such a thing and you will\r\nfail,” said Li.\r\n\r\n“How can you expect to fight successfully when you are so full of\r\ndoubts?” said Jên, angrily.\r\n\r\nHe held no more converse with his cautious colleague, but himself took\r\ncommand of the van and set out. Tien was relegated to the rear. The\r\nattack on the enemy’s camp was fixed for the second watch.\r\n\r\nNow as Tan Fu was discussing plans with his chief a whirlwind went by,\r\nwhich Fu said foretold a raid on the camp.\r\n\r\n“How shall we meet it?” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“The plans are quite ready,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nHe whispered them to the chief. So at the second watch, when the enemy\r\narrived, they saw fires on all sides; the stockades and huts burning.\r\nTsʻao Jên understood at once that all hope of a surprise was vain and\r\nhe turned to get away as quickly as possible. This was the signal for\r\nChao Yün to fall on and that cut his return road. He hastened north\r\ntoward the river, and reached the bank, but, while waiting for boats to\r\ncross the stream, up came Chang Fei and attacked.\r\n\r\nBy dint of great efforts and with the support of his colleague he got\r\ninto a boat, but most of the men were drowned in the stream. As soon as\r\nhe got to the farther shore he bolted for Fanchʻêng. He reached the\r\nwall and hailed the gate, but, instead of a friendly welcome, he heard\r\nthe rolling of drums, which was soon followed by the appearance of a\r\nbody of men. Kuan Yü led them.\r\n\r\n“I took the city a long time ago,” shouted Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nThis was a severe shock to Jên, who turned to flee. As soon as he faced\r\nabout Kuan Yü attacked and killed many of his men. The remnant hastened\r\nto Hsüchʻang. On the road the beaten general wondered who had advised\r\nhis opponents with such success.\r\n\r\nWhile the defeated general had to find his way back to the capital,\r\nYüan-tê had scored a great success. Afterwards he marched to Fanchʻêng,\r\nwhere he was welcomed by the magistrate Liu Pi, himself a scion of the\r\nruling family, who had been born in Changsha. He received Yüan-tê as a\r\nguest in his own house and gave banquets and treated him exceedingly\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIn the train of the magistrate, Yüan-tê saw a very handsome and\r\ndistinguished-looking young man, and asked who he was.\r\n\r\nLiu Pi replied, “He is my nephew, Kʻôu Fêng, an orphan, whom I am\r\ntaking care of.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê had taken a great liking for the lad and proposed to adopt him.\r\nHis guardian was willing, and so the adoption was arranged. The young\r\nman’s name was changed to Liu Fêng. When Yüan-tê left, he took his\r\nadopted son with him. He was then made to bow before Kuan Yü and Chang\r\nFei as uncles.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was doubtful of the wisdom of adopting another son, saying,\r\n“You have a son; why do you think it necessary to adopt another? It may\r\ncause confusion.”\r\n\r\n“How? I shall treat him as a father should and he will serve me as\r\nbefits a son.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was displeased. Then Yüan-tê and Tan Fu began further\r\ndiscussions of strategy and they decided to leave a guard in Fanchʻêng\r\nand to return to Hsinyeh.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Tsʻao Tsʻao’s defeated generals had gone back. When\r\nthey saw the Minister, Tsʻao Jên threw himself on the ground weeping\r\nand acknowledging his faults. He told the tale of his losses.\r\n\r\n“The fortune of war,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao. “But I should like to know who\r\nlaid Liu Pei’s plans.”\r\n\r\n“That was Tan Fu,” said Jên.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nChʻêng Yü said, “The man is not Tan Fu. When young this man was fond of\r\nfencing and used to take up the quarrels of other men and avenge their\r\nwrongs. Once, after killing his man, he let down his hair, muddied his\r\nface and was trying to escape when a lictor caught him and questioned\r\nhim. He would not reply. So they carted him through the streets beating\r\na drum and asking if any one recognised him. Nobody dared own to\r\nknowing him, if they did so. However, his companions managed to release\r\nhim secretly and he ran away under some other name. Then he turned to\r\nstudy and wandered hither and thither wherever scholars were to be\r\nfound. He was a regular disputant with Ssŭma Hui. His real name is Hsü\r\nShu (Yüan-chih) and he comes from Yingchou. Tan Fu is merely an assumed\r\nname.”\r\n\r\n“How does he compare with yourself?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Ten times cleverer.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity. If able men gather to Liu Pei his wings will soon grow.\r\nWhat is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Hsü Shu is there now; but if you wanted him it would not be difficult\r\nto call him,” replied Hsün Yu.\r\n\r\n“How could I make him come?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“He is noted for his affection for his mother. His father died young,\r\nleaving his mother a widow with one other son. Now that son is dead and\r\nhis mother has no one to care for her. If you sent and got his mother\r\nhere and told her to write and summon her son he would surely come.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao sent without loss of time and had the old lady brought to the\r\ncapital, where he treated her exceedingly well. Presently he said, “I\r\nhear you have a very talented son, who is now at Hsinyeh helping on\r\nthat rebel Liu Pei against the government. There he is like a jewel in\r\na muck-heap; it is a pity. Supposing you were to call him, I could\r\nspeak of him before the Emperor and he might get an important office.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao bade his secretaries bring along the “four precious things of the\r\nstudy,” with which the dame could write to her son.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a man is Liu Pei?” asked she.\r\n\r\nTsʻao replied, “A common sort of person from Pʻeichün, irresponsible\r\nenough to style himself Imperial Uncle, and so claiming some sort of\r\nconnection with the Hans. He is neither trustworthy nor virtuous.\r\nPeople say he is a superior man as far as externals go, but a mean man\r\nby nature.”\r\n\r\nThe dame answered in a hard voice, “Why do you malign him so bitterly?\r\nEvery one knows he is a descendant of one of the Han Princes and so\r\nrelated to the House. He has condescended to take a lowly office and is\r\nrespectful to all men. He has a reputation for benevolence. Every one,\r\nyoung and old, cowherds and firewood cutters, all know him by name and\r\nknow that he is the finest and noblest man in the world. If my son is\r\nin his service, then has he found a fitting master. You, under the name\r\nof a Han minister, are really nothing but a Han rebel. Contrary to all\r\ntruth you tell me Yüan-tê is a rebel, whereby you try to induce me to\r\nmake my son leave the light for darkness. Are you devoid of all sense\r\nof shame?”\r\n\r\nAs she finished speaking she picked up the inkstone to strike Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao. This so enraged him that he forgot himself and the need for\r\ncaution and bade the executioners lead off the old woman and put her to\r\ndeath. The adviser Chʻêng Yü, however, stopped this act of folly by\r\npointing out the effect it would have on his reputation and how it\r\nwould enhance hers, beside adding a keen desire for revenge to the\r\nmotives which led Hsü Shu to labour in the interest of Liu Pei. He\r\nclosed his remarks saying, “You had better keep her here so that Hsü\r\nShu’s body and his thoughts may be in different places. He can not\r\ndevote all his energies to helping our enemy while his mother is here.\r\nIf you keep her I think I can persuade the son to come and help you.”\r\n\r\nSo the outspoken old lady was saved. She was given quarters and cared\r\nfor. Daily Chʻêng Yü went to ask after her health, falsely claiming to\r\nbeing a sworn brother of her son’s, and so entitled to serve her and\r\ntreat her as a filial son would have done. He often sent her gifts and\r\nwrote letters to her so that she had to write in reply. And thereby he\r\nlearned her handwriting so that he could forge a “home” letter. When he\r\ncould do this without fear of detection he wrote one and sent it by the\r\nhand of a trusty person to Hsinyeh.\r\n\r\nOne day a man arrived enquiring for one Tan Fu, a secretary; he had a\r\nletter from home for him. The soldiers led him to Tan Fu. The man said\r\nhe was an official carrier of letters and had been told to bring this\r\none. Tan Fu quickly tore it open and read:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “On your brother’s death recently I was left alone; no relative was\r\n    near and I was lonely and sad. To my regret, the Minister Tsʻao\r\n    Tsʻao inveigled me into coming to the capital, and now he says you\r\n    are a rebel and he has thrown me into bonds. However, thanks to\r\n    Chʻêng Yü, my life has been spared so far, and, if you would only\r\n    come and submit too, I should be quite safe. When this reaches you,\r\n    remember how I have toiled for you and come at once, that you may\r\n    prove yourself a filial son. We may together find some way of\r\n    escape to our own place and avoid the dangers that threaten me. My\r\n    life hangs by a thread and I look to you to save me. You will not\r\n    require a second summons.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTears gushed from Hsü Shu’s eyes as he read, and with the letter in his\r\nhand he went to seek his chief, to whom he told the true story of his\r\nlife and how he had joined Yüan-tê. “I heard that Liu Piao treated men\r\nwell and went to him. I happened to arrive at a time of confusion. I\r\nsaw he was of no use, so I left him very soon. I arrived at the retreat\r\nof Ssŭma Shui-ching (‘Water-mirror’) late one night and told him, and\r\nhe blamed me for not knowing a master when I saw one. Then he told me\r\nof you and I sang that wild song in the streets to attract your\r\nattention. You took me: you used me. But now my aged mother is the\r\nvictim of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s wiles. She is in prison and he threatens to do\r\nworse. She has written to call me and I must go. I hoped to be able to\r\nrender you faithful service, but, with my dear mother a captive, I\r\nshould be useless. Therefore I must leave you and hope in the future to\r\nmeet you again.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê broke into loud moans when he heard that his adviser was to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n“The bond between mother and son is divine,” said he, “and I do not\r\nneed to be reminded where your duty lies. When you have seen your\r\nvenerable mother perhaps I may have again the happiness of receiving\r\nyour instruction.”\r\n\r\nHaving said farewell, Hsü Shu prepared to leave at once. However, at\r\nYüan-tê’s wish he consented to stay over the night.\r\n\r\nThen Sun Chʻien said privately to his master, “Hsü Shu is indeed a\r\ngenius, but he has been here long enough to know all our secrets. If\r\nyou let him go over to Tsʻao, he will be in his confidence and that\r\nwill be to our detriment. You ought to keep him at all costs and not\r\nlet him go. When Tsʻao sees he does not come he will put the mother to\r\ndeath, and that will make Hsü Shu the more zealous in your service, for\r\nhe will burn to avenge his mother’s death.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot do that. It would be very cruel and vile to procure the death\r\nof his mother that I might retain the son’s services. If I kept him it\r\nwould lead to a rupture of the parental lien, and that would be a sin I\r\nwould rather die than commit.”\r\n\r\nBoth were grieved and sighed. Yüan-tê asked the parting guest to a\r\nbanquet, but he declined saying, “With my mother a prisoner I can\r\nswallow nothing, nay, though it were brewed from gold or distilled from\r\njewels.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! your departure is as if I lost both my hands,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n“Even the liver of a dragon or the marrow of a phoenix would be bitter\r\nin my mouth.”\r\n\r\nThey looked into each other’s eyes and wept. They sat silent till dawn.\r\nWhen all was ready for the journey the two rode out of the city side by\r\nside. At Long Pavilion they dismounted to drink the stirrup cup.\r\nYüan-tê lifted the goblet and said, “It is my mean fortune that\r\nseparates me from you, but I hope that you may serve well your new lord\r\nand become famous.”\r\n\r\nHsü Shu wept as he replied, “I am but a poor ignorant person whom you\r\nhave kindly employed. Unhappily I have to break our intercourse in the\r\nmiddle, but my venerable mother is the real cause. Though Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nuse all manner of means to coerce me, yet will I never plan for him.”\r\n\r\n“After you are gone I shall only bury myself in the hills and hide in\r\nthe forests,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nTan Fu said, “I had in my heart for you the position of leader of the\r\nchieftains, but my plans have been altogether upset by my mother. I\r\nhave been of no advantage to you nor should I do any good by remaining.\r\nBut you ought to seek some man of lofty wisdom to help you in your\r\ngreat emprise. It is unseemly to be downcast.”\r\n\r\n“I shall find none to help better than you, my master.”\r\n\r\n“How can I permit such extravagant praise?” said Tan Fu. “I am only a\r\nuseless blockhead.”\r\n\r\nAs he moved off he said to the followers, “Officers, I hope you will\r\nrender the Princely One good service, whereby to write his name large\r\nin the country’s annals and cause his fame to glow in the pages of\r\nhistory. Do not be like me, a man who has left his work half done.”\r\n\r\nThey were all deeply affected. Yüan-tê could not bring himself to part\r\nfrom his friend. He escorted him a little further, and yet a little\r\nfurther, till Shu said, “I will not trouble you, O Princely One, to\r\ncome further. Let us say our farewell here.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê dismounted, took Hsü Shu by the hands and said, “Alas! we part.\r\nEach goes his way and who knows if we shall meet again?”\r\n\r\nHis tears fell like rain and Shu wept also. But the last goodbyes were\r\nsaid and when the traveller had gone Yüan-tê stood gazing after the\r\nlittle party and watched it slowly disappear. At the last glimpse he\r\nbroke into lamentation.\r\n\r\n“He is gone! What shall I do?”\r\n\r\nOne of the trees shut out the travellers from his sight and he testily\r\npointed at it, saying, “Would that I could cut down every tree in the\r\ncountryside!”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said his men.\r\n\r\n“Because they hinder my sight of Hsü Yüan-chih.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly they saw Hsü Shu galloping back.\r\n\r\nSaid Yüan-tê, “He is returning; can it be that he is going to stay?”\r\n\r\nSo he hastened forward to meet him and when they got near enough he\r\ncried, “This return is surely for no slight reason.”\r\n\r\nChecking his horse, Hsü Shu said, “In the turmoil of my feelings I\r\nforgot to say one word. There is a man of wonderful skill living about\r\ntwenty li from the city of Hsiangyang, why not seek him?”\r\n\r\n“Can I trouble you to ask him to visit me?”\r\n\r\n“He will not condescend to visit you; you must go to him. But if he\r\nconsent you will be as fortunate as the Chous when they got the aid of\r\nLü Wang, or Han when Chang Liang came to help.”\r\n\r\n“How does the unknown compare with yourself?”\r\n\r\n“With me? Compared with him I am as a worn-out cart-horse to a kilin,\r\nan old crow to a phoenix. This man is of the same kidney as Kuan Chung\r\nand Yo I but, in my opinion, he is far their superior. He has the\r\ntalent to measure the heavens and mete the earth; he is a man who\r\novershadows every other in the world.”\r\n\r\n“I would know his name.”\r\n\r\n“He belongs to Yangtu of Langya; and his name, a double name, is Chuko\r\nLiang. His minor name is Kʻung-ming. He is of good family. His father\r\nwas an official but died young and the young fellow went with his uncle\r\nto Chingchou, the Prefect of which was an old friend of his uncle’s,\r\nand he became settled there. Then his uncle died and he, with a younger\r\nbrother, Chün, were farmers. They used to amuse themselves with the\r\ncomposition of songs in the ‘Old Father Liang’ style.\r\n\r\n“On their land was a ridge of hills called the Sleeping Dragon and the\r\nelder of the two took it as a name and called himself ‘Master Sleeping\r\nDragon.’ This is your man; he is a veritable genius. You ought really\r\nto visit him and if he will help you, you need feel no more anxiety\r\nabout peace in the Empire.”\r\n\r\n“‘Water-mirror’ spoke that time of two men, Fu-lung and Fêng-chʻu, and\r\nsaid if only one of them could be got to help me all would be well.\r\nSurely he, whom you speak of, is one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Fêng-chʻu, or ‘Phoenix Fledging,’ is ‘Pʻang Tʻung’: and Fu-lung, or\r\n‘Hidden Dragon,’ is ‘Chuko Kʻung-ming.’”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê jumped with delight, “Now at last I know who the mysterious\r\nones are. How I wish they were here! But for you I should have still\r\nbeen like a blind man,” said he.\r\n\r\nSome one has celebrated in verse this interview where Hsü Shu from\r\nhorseback recommended Kʻung-ming:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Yüan-tê heard that his able friend\r\n          Must leave him, with saddened heart,\r\n        For each to the other had grown very dear,\r\n          Both wept when it came to part.\r\n        But the parting guest then mentioned a name\r\n          That echoed both loud and deep,\r\n        Like a thunder clap in a spring-time sky,\r\n          And there wakened a dragon from sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus was the famous Kʻung-ming recommended to the lord he was to serve,\r\nand Hsü Shu rode away.\r\n\r\nNow Yüan-tê understood the speech of the hermit Ssŭma Hui, and he woke\r\nas one from a drunken sleep. At the head of his officers, he retook the\r\nroad to the city and having prepared rich gifts set out, with his\r\nbrothers, for Nanyang.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of his emotions at parting Hsü Shu had mentioned\r\nthe name and betrayed the retreat of his friend. Now he thought of the\r\npossibility that Kʻung-ming would be unwilling to play the part of\r\nhelper in Yüan-tê’s scheme, so he determined to go to visit him. He\r\ntherefore took his way to Reposing Dragon Ridge and dismounted at the\r\ncottage. Asked why he had come, he replied, “I wished to serve Liu Pei\r\nof Hsiangchou but my mother has been imprisoned by Tsʻao Tsʻao, and has\r\nsent to call me. Therefore I have had to leave him. At the moment of\r\nparting I commended you to him. You may expect him speedily and I hope,\r\nSir, you will not refuse your aid but will consent to use your great\r\ntalents to help him.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming showed annoyance and said, “And so you have made me the\r\nvictim of your sacrifice.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he shook out his sleeves and left the room. The guest\r\nshamefacedly retired, mounted his horse and hastened on his way to the\r\ncapital to see his mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n        To help the lord he loved right well,\r\n          He summoned the aid of another,\r\n        When he took the distant homeward way,\r\n          At the call of a loving mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the sequel will appear in the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nANOTHER SCHOLAR INTRODUCED:\r\nTHE THREE VISITS TO THE RECLUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been said Hsü Shu hastened to the capital. When Tsʻao Tsʻao knew\r\nhe had arrived he sent two of his confidants to receive him and so he\r\nwas led first to the minister’s palace.\r\n\r\n“Why did such an illustrious scholar as you bow the knee to Liu Pei?”\r\nsaid Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“I am young and I fled to avoid the results of certain escapades. I\r\nspent some time as a wanderer and so came to Hsinyeh where I became\r\ngood friends with him. But my mother is here and when I thought of all\r\nher affection I could no longer remain absent.”\r\n\r\n“Now you will be able to take care of your mother at all times. And I\r\nmay have the privilege of receiving your instruction.”\r\n\r\nHsü Shu then took his leave and hastened to his mother’s dwelling.\r\nWeeping with emotion he made his obeisance to her at the door of her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nBut she was greatly surprised to see him and said, “What have you come\r\nhere for?”\r\n\r\n“I was at Hsinyeh, in the service of Liu of Yuchou when I received your\r\nletter. I came immediately.”\r\n\r\nHis mother suddenly grew very angry. Striking the table she cried, “You\r\nshameful and degenerate son! For years you have been a vagabond in\r\nspite of all my teaching. You are a student and know the books. You\r\nmust then know that loyalty and filial piety are often opposed. Did you\r\nnot recognise in Tsʻao a traitor, a man who flouts his king and insults\r\nthe mighty ones? Did you not see that Liu Pei was virtuous and upright\r\nas all the world knows? Moreover, he is of the House of Han and when\r\nyou were with him you were serving a fitting master. Now on the\r\nstrength of a scrap of forged writing, with no attempt at any enquiry,\r\nyou have left the light and plunged into darkness and earned a\r\ndisgraceful reputation. Truly you are stupid! How can I bear to look\r\nupon you? You have besmirched the fair fame of your forefathers and are\r\nof no use in the world.”\r\n\r\nThe son remained bowed to the earth, not daring to lift his eyes while\r\nhis mother delivered this vilifying tirade. As she said the last word\r\nshe rose suddenly and left the room. Soon after one of the servants\r\ncame out to say she had hanged herself. Her son rushed in to try to\r\nsave her, but was too late.\r\n\r\nA eulogy of her conduct has been written thus:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Wise Mother Hsü, fair is your fame,\r\n        The storied page glows with your name,\r\n        From duty’s path you never strayed,\r\n        The family’s renown you made.\r\n        To train your son no pains you spared,\r\n        For your own body nothing cared.\r\n        You stand sublime, from us apart,\r\n        Through simple purity of heart.\r\n        Brave Liu Pei’s virtues you extolled,\r\n        You blamed Tsʻao Tsʻao, the basely bold.\r\n        Of blazing fire you felt no fear,\r\n        You blenched not when the sword came near,\r\n        But dreaded lest a wilful son\r\n        Should dim the fame his fathers won.\r\n        Yes, Mother Hsü was of one mould\r\n        With famous heroines of old,\r\n        Who never shrank from injury,\r\n        And even were content to die.\r\n        Fair meed of praise, while still alive,\r\n        Was yours, and ever will survive.\r\n        Hail! Mother Hsü, your memory,\r\n        While time rolls on, shall never die.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sight of his mother dead Hsü Shu fell in a swoon and only recovered\r\nconsciousness after a long time. By and bye Tsʻao heard of it and sent\r\nmourning gifts, and in due course went in person to condole and\r\nsacrifice. The body was interred on the south of the capital and the\r\ndead woman’s unhappy son kept vigil at her tomb. He steadily rejected\r\nall gifts from Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nAt that time Tsʻao was contemplating an attack on the south. His\r\nadvisers dissuaded him, saying he should await milder weather; and he\r\nyielded. But he began to prepare, and led the river waters aside to\r\nform a lake, which he called the Training Lake, where he could accustom\r\nhis men to fight on the water.\r\n\r\nAs has been said Yüan-tê prepared gifts to offer to Chuko Liang on his\r\nvisit. One day his servants announced a stranger of extraordinary\r\nappearance, wearing a lofty head-dress and a wide belt.\r\n\r\n“Surely this is he” said Yüan-tê, and, hastily arranging his dress, he\r\nwent to welcome the visitor. But the first glance showed him that it\r\nwas the recluse of the mountains, Ssŭma Hui. However, Yüan-tê was glad\r\nto see him and led him into the inner apartment as he would an old\r\nfriend. There Pei conducted him to the seat of honour and made his\r\nobeisance, saying, “Since leaving you that day in the mountains I have\r\nbeen overwhelmed with military preparations and so have failed to visit\r\nyou as courtesy demanded. Now that the brightness has descended upon me\r\nI hope this dereliction of duty may be pardoned.”\r\n\r\n“I hear Hsü Yüan-chih is here. I have come expressly to see him,”\r\nreplied the visitor bluntly.\r\n\r\n“He has lately left for Hsüchʻang. A messenger came with a letter\r\ntelling of the imprisonment of his mother.”\r\n\r\n“Then he has just fallen into Tsʻao Tsʻao’s trap, for that letter was a\r\nforgery. I have always known his mother to be a very noble woman, and\r\neven if she were imprisoned by Tsʻao she would not summon her son like\r\nthat. Certainly the letter was a forgery. If the son did not go, the\r\nmother would be safe; if he went, she would be a dead woman.”\r\n\r\n“But how?” asked Yüan-tê, dismayed.\r\n\r\n“She is a woman of the highest principles, who would be greatly\r\nmortified at the sight of her son under such conditions.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei said, “Just as your friend was leaving he mentioned the name of\r\na certain Chuko Liang. What think you of him?”\r\n\r\nHui laughed, saying, “If Yüan-chih wanted to go, he was free to go. But\r\nwhy did he want to provoke him into coming out and showing compassion\r\nfor some one else?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you speak like that?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “Five men, Kʻung-ming, Tsʻui Chou-pʻing, Shih Kuang-yuan,\r\nMêng Kung-wei and Hsü Yüan-chih were the closest of friends. They\r\nformed a little coterie devoted to meditation on essential refinement.\r\nOnly Kʻung-ming arrived at a perception of its meaning. He used to sit\r\namong them with his arms about his knees muttering and then, pointing\r\nto his companions, he would say, ‘You, gentlemen, would become\r\ngovernors and prefects if you were in official life.’\r\n\r\n“When they asked him what was his ambition he would only smile and\r\nalways compared himself with the great scholars Kuan Chung and Yo I. No\r\none could gauge his talents.”\r\n\r\n“How comes it that Yingchou produces so many able men?” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“That old astrologer, Yin Kʻuei, used to say that the stars clustered\r\nthick over the district and so there were many wise men.”\r\n\r\nNow Kuan Yü was there and when he heard Kʻung-ming so highly praised he\r\nsaid, “Kuan Chung and Yo I are the two most famous men mentioned in the\r\n‘Spring and Autumn.’ They well overtopped the rest of mankind. Is it\r\nnot a little too much to say that Kʻung-ming compares with these two?”\r\n\r\n“In my opinion he should not be compared with these two, but rather\r\nwith two others,” said Hui.\r\n\r\n“Who are these two?” asked Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“One of them is Chiang Tzŭ-ya, who laid the foundations of the Chou\r\ndynasty so firmly that it lasted eight hundred years, and the other\r\nChang Tzŭ-fang, who made Han glorious for four centuries.”\r\n\r\nBefore the surprise called forth by this startling statement had\r\nsubsided, the visitor walked down the steps and took his leave. Liu Pei\r\nwould have kept him if he could, but he was obdurate. As he stalked\r\nproudly away he threw up his head and said, “Though the ‘Sleeping\r\nDragon’ has found his lord, he has not been born at the right time. It\r\nis a pity.”\r\n\r\n“What a wise hermit!” was Liu Pei’s comment.\r\n\r\nSoon after the three brothers set out to find the abode of the wise\r\nman. When they drew near the spot they saw a number of peasants in a\r\nfield hoeing up the weeds, and as they worked they sang:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        “The earth is a chequered board,\r\n        And the sky hangs over all,\r\n        Under it men are contending,\r\n        Some rise, but a many fall.\r\n        For those who succeed ’tis well,\r\n        But for those who go under rough.\r\n        There’s a dozing dragon hard by,\r\n        But his sleep isn’t deep enough.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stopped to listen to the song and, calling up one of the peasants,\r\nasked who made it.\r\n\r\n“It was made by Master ‘Sleeping Dragon,’” said the labourer.\r\n\r\n“Then he lives hereabout. Where?”\r\n\r\n“South of this hill there is a ridge called The Sleeping Dragon and\r\nclose by is a sparse wood. In it stands a modest cottage. That is where\r\nMaster Chuko takes his repose.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê thanked him and the party rode on. Soon they came to the ridge,\r\nmost aptly named, for indeed it lay wrapped in an atmosphere of calm\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nA poet wrote of it thus:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Not far from Hsiangyang’s massive walls\r\n        There stands, clear cut against the sky,\r\n        A lofty ridge, and at its foot\r\n        A gentle stream goes gliding by.\r\n\r\n        The contour, curving up and down,\r\n        Although by resting cloud it’s marred,\r\n        Arrests the eye; and here and there\r\n        The flank by waterfalls is scarred.\r\n\r\n        There, like a sleeping dragon coiled,\r\n        Or phoenix hid among thick pines,\r\n        You see, secure from prying eyes,\r\n        A cot, reed-built on rustic lines.\r\n\r\n        The rough-joined doors, pushed by the wind,\r\n        Swing idly open and disclose\r\n        The greatest genius of the world\r\n        Enjoying still his calm repose.\r\n\r\n        The air is full of woodland scents,\r\n        Around are hedgerows trim and green,\r\n        Close-growing intercrossed bamboos\r\n        Replace the painted doorway screen.\r\n\r\n        But look within and books you see\r\n        By every couch, near every chair;\r\n        And you may guess that common men\r\n        Are very seldom welcomed there.\r\n\r\n        The hut seems far from human ken,\r\n        So far, one might expect to find\r\n        Wild forest denizens there, trained\r\n        To serve in place of human kind.\r\n\r\n        Without a hoary crane might stand\r\n        As warden of the outer gate;\r\n        Within a long-armed gibbon come\r\n        To offer fruit upon a plate.\r\n\r\n        But enter; there refinement reigns;\r\n        Brocaded silk the lutes protect,\r\n        And burnished weapons on the walls\r\n        The green of pines outside reflect.\r\n\r\n        For he who dwells within that hut\r\n        Is talented beyond compare,\r\n        Although he lives the simple life\r\n        And harvest seems his only care.\r\n\r\n        He waits until the thund’rous call\r\n        Shall bid him wake, nor sleep again;\r\n        Then will he forth and at his word\r\n        Peace over all the land shall reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan-tê soon arrived at the door of the retreat, dismounted and knocked\r\nat the rough door of the cottage. A youth appeared and asked what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “I am Liu Pei, General of the Han Dynasty, Marquis of\r\nIchêngtʻing, Magistrate of Yuchou and Uncle of the Emperor. I am come\r\nto salute the Master.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot remember so many titles,” said the lad.\r\n\r\n“Then simply say that Liu Pei has come to enquire after him.”\r\n\r\n“The master left this morning early.”\r\n\r\n“Whither has he gone?”\r\n\r\n“His movements are very uncertain. I do not know whither he has gone.”\r\n\r\n“When will he return?”\r\n\r\n“That also is uncertain. Perhaps in three days, perhaps in ten.”\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was keen.\r\n\r\n“Let us go back since we cannot see him,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“Wait a little time,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“It would be better to return,” said Kuan Yü, “then we might send to\r\nfind out when this man had come back.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê agreed, first saying to the boy, “When the master returns,\r\ntell him that Liu Pei has been.”\r\n\r\nThey rode away. Presently Liu Pei stopped and looked back at the\r\nsurroundings of the little cottage in the wood. The mountains were\r\npicturesque rather than grand, the water clear rather than profound,\r\nthe plain was level rather than extensive, the woods luxuriant rather\r\nthan extensive. Gibbons ranged through the trees and cranes waded in\r\nthe shallow water. The pines and the bamboos vied with each other in\r\nverdure. It was a scene to linger upon.\r\n\r\nWhile Liu Pei stood regarding it, he saw a figure coming down a\r\nmountain path. The man’s bearing was lofty; he was handsome and\r\ndignified. He wore a comfortable-looking bonnet on his head and a black\r\nrobe hung about his figure in easy folds. He used a staff to help him\r\ndown the steep path.\r\n\r\n“Surely that is he!” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted and walked over to greet the stranger, whom he saluted\r\ndeferentially, saying, “Are you not Master Sleeping Dragon, Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Who are you, General?” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n“I am Liu Pei.”\r\n\r\n“I am not Kʻung-ming, but I am a friend of his. My name is Tsʻui\r\nChou-pʻing.”\r\n\r\n“Long have I known of you! I am very glad to see you,” replied Yüan-tê.\r\n“And now I pray you to be seated just where we are and let me receive\r\nyour instruction.”\r\n\r\nThe two men sat down in the wood on a stone and the two brothers ranged\r\nthemselves by Liu Pei’s side.\r\n\r\nChou-pʻing began, saying, “General, for what reason do you wish to see\r\nKʻung-ming?”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “The Empire is in confusion and troubles gather\r\neverywhere. I want your friend to tell me how to restore order.”\r\n\r\n“You, Sir, wish to arrest the present disorder although you are a\r\nkindly man and, from the oldest antiquity, the correction of disorder\r\nhas demanded stern measures. On the day that the founder of the Han\r\ndynasty first put his hand to the work and slew the wicked ruler of\r\nTsʻin, order began to replace disorder. Good government began with The\r\nFounder, (206 B.C.), and endured two hundred years; two centuries of\r\ntranquillity. Then came Wang Mang’s rebellion and disorder took the\r\nplace of order. Anon, arose Kuang-Wu, who restored the Dynasty, and\r\norder once more prevailed. We have had two centuries of order and\r\ntranquillity, and the time of trouble and battles is due. The\r\nrestoration of peace will take time; it cannot be quickly accomplished.\r\nYou, Sir, wish to get Kʻung-ming to regulate times and seasons, to\r\nrepair the cosmos; but I fear the task is indeed difficult and to\r\nattempt it would be a vain expenditure of mental energy. You know well\r\nthat he who goes with the favour of Heaven travels an easy road, he who\r\ngoes contrary meets difficulties. One cannot escape one’s lot; one\r\ncannot evade fate.”\r\n\r\n“Master,” replied Pei, “your insight is indeed deep and your words of\r\nwide meaning, but I am a scion of the House of Han and must help it.\r\nDare I talk of the inevitable and trust to fate?”\r\n\r\nChou-pʻing replied, “A simple denizen of the mountain wilds is unfitted\r\nto discuss the affairs of Empire. But you bade me speak and I have\r\nspoken; perhaps somewhat madly.”\r\n\r\n“Master, I am grateful for your instruction. But know you whither\r\nKʻung-ming has gone?”\r\n\r\n“I also came to see him and I know not where he is,” said Chou-pʻing.\r\n\r\n“If I asked you, Master, to accompany me to my poor bit of territory,\r\nwould you come?”\r\n\r\n“I am too dilatory, too fond of leisure and ease, and no longer have\r\nany ambitions. But I will see you another time.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he saluted and left.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers also mounted and started homeward. Presently Chang\r\nFei said, “We have not found Kʻung-ming and we have had to listen to\r\nthe wild ravings of this so-called scholar. There is the whole result\r\nof this journey.”\r\n\r\n“His words were those of a deep thinker,” replied Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSome days after the return to Hsinyeh, Yüan-tê sent to find out whether\r\nKʻung-ming had returned and the messenger came back saying that he had.\r\nWherefore Liu Pei prepared for another visit. Again Chang Fei showed\r\nhis irritation by remarking, “Why must you go hunting after this\r\nvillager? Send and tell him to come.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” said Yüan-tê, “The Teacher Mêng, (Mencius) said, ‘To try to\r\nsee the sage without going his way is like barring a door you wish to\r\nenter.’ Kʻung-ming is the greatest sage of the day; how can I summon\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê rode away to make his visit, his two brothers with him as\r\nbefore. It was winter and exceedingly cold; angry clouds covered the\r\nwhole sky. Before they had gone far a bitter wind began to blow in\r\ntheir faces and the snow began to fall. Soon the mountains were of jade\r\nand the trees of silver.\r\n\r\n“It is very cold and the earth is frozen hard, no fighting is possible\r\nnow.” Said Chang Fei. “Yet we are going all this way to get advice\r\nwhich will be useless to us. Where is the sense of it? Let us rather\r\nget back to Hsinyeh out of the cold.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “I am set upon proving my zeal to Kʻung-ming, but if\r\nyou, my brother, do not like the cold, you can return.”\r\n\r\n“I do not fear death; do you think I care for the cold? But I do care\r\nabout wasting my brother’s energies,” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“Say no more,” said Yüan-tê, and they travelled on.\r\n\r\nWhen they drew near the little wood they heard singing in a roadside\r\ninn and stopped to listen. This was the song:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Although possessed of talent rare,\r\n          This man has made no name;\r\n        Alas! the day is breaking late\r\n          That is to show his fame.\r\n          O friends you know the tale:\r\n        Th’ aged man constrained to leave\r\n          His cottage by the sea.\r\n        To follow in a prince’s train\r\n          His counsellor to be.\r\n        Eight hundred feudal chieftains met\r\n          Who came with one accord;\r\n        The happy omen, that white fish,\r\n          That leapt the boat aboard;\r\n        The gory field in distant wilds,\r\n          Whence flowed a crimson tide,\r\n        And him acknowledged chief in war\r\n          Whose virtues none denied;\r\n        That Kaoyang rustic, fond of wine,\r\n          Who left his native place\r\n        And went to serve so faithfully\r\n          The man of handsome face;\r\n        And one who spoke of ruling chiefs\r\n          In tones so bold and free,\r\n        But sitting at the festive board\r\n          Was full of courtesy;\r\n        And one, ’twas he who laid in dust\r\n          Walled cities near four score—\r\n        But men of doughty deeds like these\r\n          On earth are seen no more.\r\n        Now had these men not found their lord\r\n          Would they be known to fame?\r\n        Yet having found, they served him well\r\n          And so achieved a name.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song ended, the singer’s companion tapping the table sang:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        We had a famous emperor,\r\n          Who drew his shining sword,\r\n        Cleansed all the land within the seas\r\n          And made himself its lord.\r\n        In time his son succeeded him,\r\n          And so from son to son\r\n        The lordship passed, held firm until\r\n          Four hundred years had run.\r\n        Then dawned a day of weaklier sons,\r\n          The fiery virtue failed,\r\n        Then ministers betrayed their trust,\r\n          Court intrigues vile prevailed.\r\n        The omens came; a serpent black\r\n          Coiled on the dragon throne,\r\n        While in the hall of audience\r\n          Unholy haloes shone.\r\n        Now bandits swarm in all the land\r\n          And noble strives with chief,\r\n        The common people, sore perplexed,\r\n          Can nowhere find relief.\r\n        Let’s drown our sorrows in the cup,\r\n          Be happy while we may,\r\n        Let those who wish run after fame\r\n          That is to last for aye.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two men laughed loud and clapped their hands as the second singer\r\nceased. Yüan-tê thought full surely the longed-for sage was there, so\r\nhe dismounted and entered the inn. He saw the two merry-makers sitting\r\nopposite each other at a table. One was pale with a long beard; the\r\nother had a strikingly refined face. Yüan-tê saluted them and said,\r\n“Which of you is Master Sleeping Dragon?”\r\n\r\n“Who are you, Sir?” asked the long-bearded one. “What business have you\r\nwith Sleeping Dragon?”\r\n\r\n“I am Liu Pei. I want to enquire of him how to restore tranquillity to\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“Well, neither of us is your man, but we are friends of his. My name is\r\nShih Kuang-yüan and my friend here is Mêng Kung-wei.”\r\n\r\n“I know you both by reputation,” said Yüan-tê smiling. “I am indeed\r\nfortunate to meet you in this haphazard way. Will you not come to the\r\nSleeping Dragon’s retreat and talk for a time? I have horses here for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“We idle folk of the wilds know nothing of tranquillising States. Do\r\nnot trouble to ask, please. Pray mount again and go your way in search\r\nof Sleeping Dragon.”\r\n\r\nSo he remounted and went his way. He reached the little cottage,\r\ndismounted and tapped at the door. The same lad answered his knock and\r\nhe asked whether the Master had returned.\r\n\r\n“He is in his room reading,” said the boy.\r\n\r\nJoyful indeed was Liu Pei as he followed the lad in. In front of the\r\nmiddle door he saw written this pair of scrolls:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        By purity manifest the inclination:\r\n        By repose affect the distant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he was looking at this couplet he heard some one singing in a\r\nsubdued voice and stopped by the door to peep in. He saw a young man\r\nclose to a charcoal brazier, hugging his knees while he sang:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        The phoenix flies high, ah me!\r\n        And only will perch on a wutung tree.\r\n        The scholar is hid, ah me!\r\n        Till his lord appear he can patient be.\r\n        He tills his fields, ah me!\r\n        He is well-content and I love my home,\r\n        He awaits his day, ah me!\r\n        His books and his lute to leave and roam.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the song ended Yüan-tê advanced and saluted saying, “Master, long\r\nhave I yearned for you, but have found it impossible to salute you.\r\nLately one Hsu spoke of you and I hastened to your dwelling, only to\r\ncome away disappointed. This time I have braved the elements and come\r\nagain and my reward is here; I see your face, and I am indeed\r\nfortunate.”\r\n\r\nThe young man hastily returned the salute and said, “General, you must\r\nbe that Liu Pei of Yuchou who wishes to see my brother.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Master, you are not the Sleeping Dragon!” said Yüan-tê, starting\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“I am his younger brother, Chün. He has an elder brother, Chin, now\r\nwith Sun in Chiangtung as a secretary. Kʻung-ming is the second of our\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\n“Is your brother at home?”\r\n\r\n“Only yesterday he arranged to go a jaunt with Tsʻui Chou-pʻing.”\r\n\r\n“Whither have they gone?”\r\n\r\n“Who can say? They may take a boat and sail away among the lakes, or go\r\nto gossip with the priests in some remote mountain temple, or wander\r\noff to visit a friend in some far away village, or be sitting in some\r\ncave with a lute or a chessboard. Their goings and comings are\r\nuncertain and nobody can guess at them.”\r\n\r\n“What very poor luck have I! Twice have I failed to meet the great\r\nsage.”\r\n\r\n“Pray sit a few moments and let me offer you some tea.”\r\n\r\n“Brother, since the master is not here I pray you remount and go,” said\r\nChang Fei.\r\n\r\n“Since I am here, why not a little talk before we go home again?” said\r\nYüan-tê.\r\n\r\nThen turning to his host he continued, “Can you tell me if your worthy\r\nbrother is skilled in strategy and studies works on war?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“This is worse than the other,” grumbled Chang Fei. “And the wind and\r\nsnow are getting worse; we ought to go back.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê turned on him angrily and told him to stop.\r\n\r\nChün said, “Since my brother is absent I will not presume to detain you\r\nlonger. I will return your call soon.”\r\n\r\n“Please do not take that trouble. In a few days I will come again. But\r\nif I could borrow paper and pencil I would leave a note to show your\r\nworthy brother that I am zealous and earnest.”\r\n\r\nChün produced the “four treasures” of the scholar and Yüan-tê, thawing\r\nout the frozen brush between his lips, spread the sheet of delicate\r\nnote-paper and wrote:—\r\n\r\n“Pei has long admired your fame. He has visited your dwelling twice,\r\nbut to his great disappointment he has gone empty away. He humbly\r\nremembers that he is a distant relative of the Emperor, that he has\r\nundeservedly enjoyed fame and rank. When he sees the proper government\r\nwrested aside and replaced by pretence, the foundation of the State\r\ncrumbling away, hordes of bravos creating confusion in the country and\r\nan evil cabal behaving unseemly toward the rightful Prince, then his\r\nheart and gall are torn to shreds. Though he has a real desire to\r\nassist, yet is he deficient in the needful skill. Wherefore he turns to\r\nthe Master, trusting in his kindness, graciousness, loyalty and\r\nrighteousness. Would the Master but use his talent, equal to that of Lü\r\nWang, and perform great deeds like Chang Tzŭ-fang, then would the\r\nEmpire be happy and the throne would be secure.”\r\n\r\n“This is written to tell you that, after purification of mind with\r\nfasting and of body with fragrant baths, Pei will come again to\r\nprostrate himself in your honoured presence and receive enlightenment.”\r\n\r\nThe letter written and given to Chün, Yüan-tê took his leave,\r\nexceedingly disappointed at this second failure. As he was mounting he\r\nsaw the serving lad waving his hand outside the hedge and heard him\r\ncall out, “The old Master is coming”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê looked and then saw a figure seated on a donkey leisurely\r\njogging along over a bridge.\r\n\r\nThe rider of the donkey wore a cap with long flaps down to his\r\nshoulders and his body was wrapped in a fox fur robe. A youth followed\r\nhim bearing a jar of wine. As he came through the snow he hummed a\r\nsong:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        ’Tis eve, the sky is overcast.\r\n        The north wind comes with icy blast,\r\n        Light snowflakes whirl adown until\r\n        A white pall covers dale and hill.\r\n\r\n        Perhaps above the topmost sky\r\n        White dragons strive for mastery,\r\n        The armour scales from their forms riven\r\n        Are scattered o’er the world wind-driven.\r\n\r\n        Amid the storm there jogs along\r\n        A simple wight who croons a song.\r\n        “O poor plum trees, the gale doth tear\r\n        Your blossoms off and leave you bare.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here at last is the Sleeping Dragon,” thought Yüan-tê, hastily\r\nslipping out of the saddle. He saluted the donkey rider as he neared\r\nand said, “Master, it is hard to make way against this cold wind. I and\r\nmy companions have been waiting long.”\r\n\r\nThe rider got off his donkey and returned the bow, while Chuko Chün\r\nfrom behind said, “This is not my brother; it is his father-in-law,\r\nHuang Chʻêng-yen.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê said, “I chanced to hear the song you were singing; it is very\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\nChʻêng-yen replied, “It is a little poem I read in my son-in-law’s\r\nhouse and I recalled it as I crossed the bridge and saw the plum trees\r\nin the hedge. And so it happened to catch your ear, noble Sir.”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen your son-in-law lately?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“That is just what I have come to do now.”\r\n\r\nAt this Yüan-tê bade him farewell and went on his way. The storm was\r\nvery grievous to bear, but worse than the storm was the grief in his\r\nheart as he looked back at Sleeping Dragon Ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n        One winter’s day through snow and wind\r\n        A prince rode forth the sage to find;\r\n        Alas! his journey was in vain,\r\n        And sadly turned he home again.\r\n\r\n        The stream stood still beneath the bridge\r\n        A sheet of ice draped rock and ridge,\r\n        His steed benumbed with biting cold\r\n        But crawled as he were stiff and old.\r\n\r\n        The snow-flakes on the rider’s head\r\n        Were like pear-blossoms newly shed,\r\n        Or like the willow-catkins light\r\n        They brushed his cheek in headlong flight.\r\n\r\n        He stayed his steed, he looked around,\r\n        The snow lay thick on tree and mound,\r\n        The Sleeping Dragon Ridge lay white\r\n        A hill of silver, glistening bright.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the return to Hsinyeh the time slipped away till spring was near.\r\nThen Yüan-tê cast lots to find the propitious day for another journey\r\nin search of the sage. The day being selected he fasted for three days\r\nand then changed his dress ready for the visit. His two brothers viewed\r\nthe preparations with disapproval and presently made up their minds to\r\nremonstrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The sage and the fighting man never agree,\r\n        A warrior despises humility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will tell what they said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nPLAN FOR THREE KINGDOMS:\r\nTHE SUNS AVENGE THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing discouraged by two unsuccessful visits to the retreat of the\r\nsage whose advice he sought to secure, Liu Pei made preparations for a\r\nthird visit. His brothers disapproved, and Kuan Yü said, “Brother, you\r\nhave sought him twice, surely this is showing even too much deference.\r\nI do not believe in this fame of his for learning; he is avoiding you\r\nand dare not submit to the test. Why so obstinately hold this idea?”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong, my brother. Duke Huan of Chʻi paid five visits to the\r\n‘Hermit of the Eastern Suburb’ before he got to see his face. And my\r\ndesire to see the sage is even greater than his.”\r\n\r\n“I think you are mistaken,” said Chang Fei. “How can this villager be\r\nsuch a marvel of wisdom? You should not go again and, if he will not\r\ncome, I will bring him with a hempen rope.”\r\n\r\n“Have you forgotten the great Prince Wên’s visit to Chiang Tzŭ-ya, the\r\nold man of the Eastern Sea? If he could show such deference to a wise\r\nman, where am I too deferential? If you will not go, your brother and I\r\nwill go without you,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“If you two go, how can I hang back?” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“If you go, then you must be polite.”\r\n\r\nFei said he would not forget himself, and the three set out. When they\r\nwere half a li from the little cottage, Yüan-tê dismounted, deciding to\r\nshow his respect by approaching the house on foot. Very soon he met\r\nChuko Chün, whom he saluted with great deference, enquiring whether his\r\nbrother was at home.\r\n\r\n“He returned last evening; you can see him to-day, General.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this he went off with some swagger.\r\n\r\n“Fortune favours me this time,” said Yüan-tê, “I am going to see the\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\n“That was a rude fellow”, said Fei, “it would not have hurt him to have\r\nconducted us to the house. Why did he go off like that?”\r\n\r\n“Each one has his own affairs,” said his brother. “What power have we\r\nover him?”\r\n\r\nSoon the three stood at the door and they knocked. The serving lad came\r\nout and asked their business and Yüan-tê said very deferentially, “I\r\nwould trouble the servant of the genius, gentle page, to inform the\r\nMaster that Liu Pei wishes to pay his respects to him.”\r\n\r\n“My Master is at home, but he is asleep.”\r\n\r\n“In that case do not announce me.”\r\n\r\nHe bade his two brothers wait at the door quietly and he himself\r\nentered with careful steps. There was the man he sought, lying asleep\r\non the couch, stretched on a simple mat. Yüan-tê saluted him with\r\njoined hands at a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nThe time passed and still the sleeper did not wake. The two brothers\r\nleft without, beginning to feel impatient, also came in and Chang Fei\r\nwas annoyed at seeing his revered elder brother respectfully standing\r\nby while another slept.\r\n\r\n“What an arrogant fellow is this Master?” said he. “There is our\r\nbrother waiting, while he sleeps on perfectly carelessly. I will go to\r\nthe back of the place and let off a bomb and see if that will rouse\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; you must do nothing of the kind,” whispered Kuan Yü, and then\r\nYüan-tê told them to go out again.\r\n\r\nJust then he noticed that the Master moved. He turned over as though\r\nabout to rise, but, instead, he faced the wall and again fell asleep.\r\nThe serving lad made as if he would rouse his master, but Yüan-tê\r\nforbade him to be disturbed and he waited yet another weary hour. Then\r\nKʻung-ming woke up repeating to himself the lines:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        “Can any know what fate is his?\r\n        Yet have I felt throughout my life,\r\n        The day would come at last to quit\r\n        The calm retreat for toil and strife.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he finished he turned to the lad saying, “Have any of the usual\r\npeople come?”\r\n\r\n“Liu, the Uncle of the Emperor is here,” said the boy. “He has been\r\nwaiting some time.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not tell me?” said he, rising from the couch. “I must\r\ndress.”\r\n\r\nHe rose and turned into a room behind to dress. In a short time he\r\nre-appeared, his clothing properly arranged, to receive his visitor.\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê saw coming toward him a man rather below medium height\r\nwith a refined face. He wore a head-wrap and a long crane-white gown.\r\nHe moved with much dignity as though he was rather more than mortal.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê bowed saying, “I am one of the offshoots of the Han family, a\r\nsimple person from Cho. I have long known the Master’s fame, which has\r\nindeed thundered in my ear. Twice I have come to visit you, without\r\nsuccess. Once I left my name on your writing table; you may have my\r\nnote.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “This hermit is but a dilatory person by\r\ntemperament. I know I have to thank you for more than one vain visit\r\nand I am ashamed to think of them.”\r\n\r\nThese courteous remarks and the proper bows exchanged, the two men sat\r\nin their relative positions as host and guest and the serving lad\r\nbrought tea. Then Kʻung-ming said, “From your letter I know that you\r\ngrieve for both people and government. If I were not so young and if I\r\npossessed any talent, I would venture to question you.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “Ssŭma Hui and Hsü Shu have both spoken of you; can it\r\nbe that their words were vain? I trust, O Master, that you will not\r\ndespise my worthlessness but will condescend to instruct me.”\r\n\r\n“The two men you speak of are very profound scholars. I am but a\r\npeasant, a mere farmer, and who am I that I should talk of Empire\r\npolitics? Those two misled you when they spoke of me. Why do you reject\r\nthe beautiful jewel for a worthless pebble?”\r\n\r\n“But your abilities are world embracing and marvellous. How can you be\r\ncontent to allow time to pass while you idle away life in these\r\nsecluded haunts? I conjure you, O Master, to remember the inhabitants\r\nof the world and remove my crass ignorance by bestowing instruction\r\nupon me.”\r\n\r\n“But what is your ambition, General?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê moved his seat nearer to his host and said, “The Hans are\r\nsinking; designing ministers steal away their authority. I am weak, yet\r\nI desire to restore the State to its right mind. But my ignorance is\r\ntoo vast, my means are too slender and I know not where to turn. Only\r\nyou, Master, can lighten my darkness and preserve me from falling. How\r\nhappy should I be if you would do so!”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “One bold man after another has arisen in various\r\nparts of the Empire ever since the days of the great rebel Tung Cho.\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was not so powerful as Yüan Shao, but he overcame him by\r\nseizing the favourable moment and using his men properly. Now he is\r\nall-powerful; he rules an immense army and, through his control of the\r\nCourt, the various feudal lords as well. You cannot think of opposing\r\nhim. Then the Suns have held their territory in Chiangtung for three\r\ngenerations. Their position may not appear too secure, but they have\r\npopularity to appeal to. You can gain support but win no success there.\r\nChingchou on the north rests on the two rivers Han and Mien; their\r\ninterests lie in all to the south of them; on the east they touch Wu\r\nand on the west they extend to the ancient states Pa and Shu. This is\r\nthe area in which decisive battles have to be won and one must hold it\r\nin order to be secure and Heaven has virtually made it yours. Yichou is\r\nan important place, fertile and extensive, a country favoured of Heaven\r\nand that through which the Founder of Han obtained the Empire. Its\r\nruler Liu Chang is ignorant and weak. The people are noble and the\r\ncountry prosperous, but he does not know how to hold it all, and all\r\nthe able men of the district are yearning for an enlightened prince. As\r\nyou are a scion of the Family, well known throughout the land as trusty\r\nand righteous, a whole-hearted hero, who greatly desires to win the\r\nsupport of the wise, if you get possession of Yi and Ching, if on the\r\nwest you are in harmony with the Jung tribes, on the south win over I\r\nand Yüeh, make an alliance with Sun Chʻüan, and maintain good\r\ngovernment, you can await confidently the day when heaven shall offer\r\nyou the desired opportunity. Then you may depute a worthy leader to go\r\nto the north-east while you take command of an expedition to the\r\nnorth-west, and will you not find the warmest welcome prepared for you\r\nby the people? This done the completion of the task will be easy. The\r\nHans will be restored. And I will be your adviser in all these\r\noperations if you will only undertake them.”\r\n\r\nHe paused while he bade the lad bring out a map. As this was unrolled\r\nKʻung-ming went on, “There you see the fifty four divisions of\r\nSsŭchʻuan. Should you wish to take the overlordship you will yield to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao in the north till the time of Heaven be come, to Sun Chʻüan\r\nin the south till the position may become favourable. You, General,\r\nwill be the Man and complete the trinity. Chingchou is to be taken\r\nfirst as a home, the west next for the foundation of domination. When\r\nyou are firmly established you can lay your plans for the attainment of\r\nthe whole Empire.”\r\n\r\nAs Kʻung-ming ceased his harangue, Yüan-tê left his place and saluted\r\nhim, saying, “Your words, O Master, render everything so clear that\r\nmeseems the clouds are swept aside and I see the clear sky. But\r\nChingchou belongs to Liu Piao, my kinsman, and Yichou to another\r\nkinsman; I could hardly take the land from them.”\r\n\r\n“I have studied the stars and I know Liu Piao is not long for this\r\nworld; the other is not the sort of man to endure. Both places will\r\ncertainly fall to you.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê bowed his acknowledgments. And so, in one conversation,\r\nKʻung-ming proved that he, who had lived in complete retirement all his\r\nlife, knew and foresaw the three fragments into which the Empire was to\r\nbreak. True, indeed, is it that throughout all the ages no one has ever\r\nequalled his intelligence and mastery of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Behold, when Liu Pei frets that he is weak,\r\n        Then “Sleeping Dragon” is not far to seek;\r\n        When he desires to know how things will hap,\r\n        The Master, smiling, shows him on the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Though I be of small repute and scanty virtue,” said Yüan-tê, “I hope,\r\nO Master, you will not despise me for my worthlessness, but will leave\r\nthis retreat to help me. I will assuredly listen most reverently to\r\nyour words.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “I have long been happy on my farm and am fond of\r\nmy leisure. I fear I cannot obey your command.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê wept. “If you will not, O Master, what will become of the\r\npeople?”\r\n\r\nThe tears rolled down unchecked upon the lapel and sleeves of his robe.\r\nThis proved to Kʻung-ming the sincerity of his desire and he said,\r\n“General if you will accept me, I will render what trifling service I\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê  was delighted. He called in Kuan and Chang to make their\r\nbow and brought out the gifts he had prepared. Kʻung-ming refused them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“These are not gifts to engage your services, but mere proof of my\r\nregard,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nThen the presents were accepted. They all remained that night at the\r\nfarm. Next day Chuko Chün returned and his brother said to him, “Uncle\r\nLiu has come thrice to see me and now I must go with him. Keep up the\r\nfarm in my absence and do not let the place go to ruin for, as soon as\r\nmy work is accomplished, I will certainly return.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Then, turning from his humble home,\r\n        He thought of peaceful days to come,\r\n        When he should take the homeward way\r\n        And ne’er beyond the valley stray.\r\n        But duty kept him in the west,\r\n        And there he found his place of rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old poem may be quoted here:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Founder of Han seized his gleaming blade\r\n    And at Mangtang the blood of the white snake flowed.\r\n    He conquered Tsʻin, destroyed Chʻu and entered Hsienyang.\r\n    After two centuries of rule the line was near broken,\r\n    But Kuang-Wu, the great, restored the glory at Loyang.\r\n    And his children occupied the throne\r\n    Till decay began in the days of Huan and Ling.\r\n    The Emperor Ling removed the capital to Hsüchʻang,\r\n    And, within the four seas, all was confusion.\r\n    Bold spirits started up in fierce contention.\r\n    Tsʻao Tsʻao, seized the favourable moment\r\n    And the Imperial authority passed into his hands,\r\n    While the Suns made to themselves\r\n    A glorious heritage east of the river,\r\n    Solitary and poor, Liu Pei wandered from place to place,\r\n    Till he found a haven in Hsinyeh.\r\n    Sorely distressed he was at the sorrows of the people,\r\n    But the Sleeping Dragon conceived a noble ambition,\r\n    Within his breast were thoughts\r\n    Of great things to be accomplished by force of arms.\r\n    Then, because of the parting words of Hsü Shu,\r\n    And by the thrice repeated visits to his retreat,\r\n    The great hero found and knew his mentor.\r\n    When the age of Kʻung-ming was but thrice nine years,\r\n    He turned from his books, put aside his lute\r\n    And left the peaceful fields he had loved,\r\n    Under his guidance Chingchou was taken\r\n    And the Land of the Four Streams conquered.\r\n    He unrolled great schemes, as one all knowing,\r\n    In speech, he went to and fro in the world.\r\n    The sound of war drums rolled from his tongue,\r\n    The words from his heart stirred one to the utmost depths,\r\n    The dragon pranced, the tiger glared,\r\n    And peace was brought to the world.\r\n    Through all the ages his fame shall never decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter taking leave of the younger brother, Yüan-tê and his followers\r\nleft for Hsinyeh, with Kʻung-ming as companion. When they took up their\r\nabode there, Kʻung-ming was treated as a master, eating at the same\r\ntable, sleeping on the same couch as Liu Pei. They spent whole days\r\nconversing over the affairs of the Empire.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming said, “Tsʻao Tsʻao is training his men for naval service and\r\nhence certainly intends to invade the country south of the river. We\r\nought to send our spies to ascertain what he is really doing.”\r\n\r\nSo spies were despatched.\r\n\r\nNow after Sun Chʻüan had succeeded to the heritage of his father and\r\nbrother he sent far and wide to invite men of ability to aid him. He\r\nestablished lodging places for them in Wu, and directed Ku Yung and\r\nChang Hung to welcome and entertain all those who came. And year by\r\nyear they flocked in, one recommending another. Among them were Kʻan\r\nTsê, of Kueichi; Yen Chün, of Pʻêngchʻêng; Hsüeh Tsung, of Pʻeihsien;\r\nChʻêng Ping, of Junan; Chu Huan, of Wuchün; Lu Chi, of the same place;\r\nChang Wên, of Wu; Ling Tʻung, of Kueichi and Wu Tsʻan of Wuchʻêng; and\r\nall these scholars were treated with great deference.\r\n\r\nSome able leaders came also, Lü Mêng, of Junan; Lu Hsün, of Wuchün; Hsü\r\nShêng, of Langya; Pʻan Chang, of Tungchün and Ting Fêng of Luchiang.\r\nThus Sun Chʻüan obtained the assistance of many men of ability both in\r\npeace and war and all went well with him.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh year of “Established Tranquillity” Tsʻao Tsʻao had\r\nbroken the power of Yüan Shao. Then he sent a messenger to Chiangtung\r\nordering Sun Chʻüan to send his son to court to serve in the retinue of\r\nthe Emperor. Sun, however, hesitated to comply with this request and\r\nthe matter was the subject of much discussion. His mother, the lady Wu,\r\nsent for Chou Yü and Chang Chao and asked their advice.\r\n\r\nThe latter said, “He wishes a son to be present at court as a hostage\r\nwhereby he has a hold upon us, as formerly was the case with all the\r\nfeudal chiefs. If we do not comply with this request he will doubtless\r\nattack the territory. There is some peril.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü said, “Our lord has succeeded to the heritage and has a large\r\narmy of veterans and ample supplies. He has able men ready to do his\r\nbidding, and why should he be compelled to send a hostage to any man?\r\nTo send a hostage is to be forced into joining Tsʻao, and to carry out\r\nhis behests, whatever they be. Then we shall be in his power. It would\r\nbe better not to send, but rather to wait patiently the course of\r\nevents and prepare plans to attack.”\r\n\r\n“That is also my opinion,” said the Dowager.\r\n\r\nSo Sun Chʻüan dismissed the messenger but did not send his son. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao resented this and had since nourished schemes for the destruction\r\nof the Suns. But their realisation had been delayed by the dangers on\r\nthe north and, so far, no attack had been made.\r\n\r\nLate in the eighth year, Sun Chʻüan led his armies against Huang Tsu\r\nand fought on the Great River, where he was successful in several\r\nbattles. One of Sun’s leaders, Ling Tsʻao, led a fleet of light vessels\r\nup the river and broke into Hsiakʻou but was killed by an arrow. He\r\nleft a son, Ling Tʻung, fifteen years of age, who led another\r\nexpedition to recover his father’s corpse and was so far successful.\r\nAfter that, as the war was inclined to go against him, Sun Chʻüan\r\nturned again to his own country.\r\n\r\nNow Sun Chʻüan’s brother, Sun I, was Prefect of Tanyang. He was a hard\r\nman and given to drink and, in his cups, very harsh to his men,\r\nordering the infliction of severe floggings. Two of his officers, Kuei\r\nLan and Tai Yüan, bore their chief a grudge and sought to assassinate\r\nhim. They took into their confidence one Pien Hung, of the escort, and\r\nthe three plotted to kill their master at a great assembly of officials\r\nat Tanyang amid the banquets and junketings.\r\n\r\nSun’s wife was skilled in divination and on the day of the great\r\nbanquet she cast a most inauspicious lot. Wherefore she besought her\r\nhusband to stay away from the assembly. But he was obstinate and went.\r\nThe faithless guardsman followed his master in the dusk when the\r\ngathering dispersed, and stabbed him with a dagger. The two prime\r\nmovers at once seized their accomplice and beheaded him in the market\r\nplace. Then they went to Sun’s residence, which they plundered. Kuei\r\nLan was taken with the beauty of the dead Prefect’s wife and told her\r\nthat as he had avenged the death of her husband she must go with him,\r\nor he would slay her. The wife pleaded that it was too soon after her\r\nhusband’s death to think of re-marriage but promised to be his after\r\nthe mourning sacrifices.\r\n\r\nShe thus obtained a respite, which she utilised to send for two old\r\nGenerals of her husband’s, Sun Kao and Fu Ying. They came and she\r\ntearfully told her tale.\r\n\r\n“My husband had great faith in you. Now Kuei and Tai have compassed his\r\ndeath, and have laid the crime on Pien Hung. They have plundered my\r\nhouse and carried off my servants and slaves. Worse than this, Kuei Lan\r\ninsists that I shall be his wife. To gain time I have pretended to\r\nfavour this proposal and I pray you now to send the news to my\r\nhusband’s brother and beg him to slay these two miscreants and avenge\r\nthis wrong. I will never forget your kindness in this life or the\r\nnext.”\r\n\r\nAnd she bowed before them. They wept also and said, “We were much\r\nattached to our master and now that he has come to an untimely end we\r\nmust avenge him. Dare we not carry out your behests?”\r\n\r\nSo they sent a trusty messenger. On the day of the sacrifices the lady\r\ncalled in her two friends and hid them in a secret chamber. Then the\r\nceremonies were performed in the great hall. These over, she put off\r\nher mourning garb, bathed and perfumed herself, and assumed an\r\nexpression of joy. She laughed and talked as usual, so that Kuei Lan\r\nrejoiced in his heart, thinking of the pleasure that was to be his.\r\n\r\nWhen night came she sent a slave girl to call her suitor to the Palace,\r\nwhere she entertained him at supper. When he had well drunk, she\r\nsuggested that they should retire and led him to the chamber where her\r\nfriends were waiting. He followed without the least hesitation. As soon\r\nas she entered the room she called out, “Where are you, Generals?” Out\r\nrushed the two men, and the drunken man, incapable of any resistance,\r\nwas despatched with daggers.\r\n\r\nNext she invited Tai Yüan to a supper and he was slain in similar\r\nfashion. After that she sent to the houses of her enemies and slew all\r\ntherein. This done, she resumed her mourning garb and the heads of the\r\ntwo men were hung as a sacrifice before the coffin of her husband.\r\n\r\nVery soon her brother-in-law came with an army, and hearing the story\r\nof the deeds of the two generals from the widow, gave them office and\r\nput them over Tanyang. When he left he took the widow to his own home\r\nto pass the remainder of her days. All those who heard of her brave\r\nconduct were loud in praise of her virtue:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Full of resource and virtuous, few in the world are like her.\r\n    Guilefully wrought she and compassed the death of the lusty\r\n                                                             assassins,\r\n    Faithful servants are always ready to deal with rebellion,\r\n    None can ever excel that heroine famous in East Wu.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brigandage that had troubled Wu had all been suppressed and a large\r\nfleet (of seven thousand) keels were in the Yangtse River ready for\r\nservice. Sun Chʻüan appointed Chou Yü to be the Admiral-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth year (207 A.D.) the Dowager Lady Wu, feeling her end\r\napproaching, called to her the two advisers Chou Yü and Chang Chao and\r\nspoke thus:—“I came of a family of Wu, but losing my parents in early\r\nlife, my brother and I went into Yüeh, and then I married into this\r\nfamily. I bore my husband four sons, not without premonitions of the\r\ngreatness to be theirs. With my first, I dreamed of the moon and with\r\nmy second, Chʻüan, of the sun, which omens were interpreted by the\r\nsoothsayer as signs of their great honour. Unhappy Tsʻê died young, but\r\nChʻüan inherited and it is he whom I pray you both to assist with one\r\naccord. Then may I die in peace.”\r\n\r\nAnd to her son she said, “These two you are to serve as they were your\r\nmasters and treat them with all respect. My sister and I both were\r\nwives to your father, and so she is also a mother to you and you are to\r\nserve her after I am gone as you now serve me. And you must treat your\r\nsister with affection and find a handsome husband for her.”\r\n\r\nThen she died and her son mourned for her, but of that and her burial\r\nnothing will be said.\r\n\r\nThe following year they began to discuss an attack upon Huang Tsu.\r\nChang Chao said the armies should not move during the period of\r\nmourning; however, Chou Yü, more to the point, said that vengeance\r\nshould not be postponed on that account; it could not wait upon times\r\nand seasons. Still Sun Chʻüan halted between two opinions and would not\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nThen came Lü Mêng, the Commander of the North, who said to his master,\r\n“While I was at Lungchiushuikʻou one of Huang Tsu’s captains, Kan Ning\r\nby name, offered to surrender. I found out all about him. He is\r\nsomething of a scholar, is forceful, fond of wandering about as a\r\nknight-errant. He assembled a band of outlaws with whom he roamed over\r\nthe rivers and lakes where he would terrorise everybody. He wore a bell\r\nat his waist and at the sound of this bell every one fled and hid. He\r\nfitted his boats with sails of Ssŭchʻuan brocade and people called him\r\nthe ‘Pirate with Sails of Silk.’\r\n\r\n“Then he reformed. He and his band went to Liu Piao, but they left him\r\nwhen they saw he would never accomplish anything and now they would\r\nserve under your banner, only that Huang Tsu detains them at Hsiakʻou.\r\nFormerly when you were attacking Huang Tsu, he owed the recovery of\r\nHsiakʻou to this same Kan Ning, whom he treated with liberality, but\r\nwhen Su Fei, the Commander-in-Chief, recommended him for promotion,\r\nHuang Tsu said he was unsuited for any high position as, after all, he\r\nwas no more than a pirate.\r\n\r\n“So Kan Ning became a disappointed and resentful man. Su Fei tried to\r\nwin him over to good humour and invited him to wine parties and said,\r\n‘I have put your name forward many times but our chief says he has no\r\nplace suitable for you. However, time slips away and man’s life is not\r\nvery long. One must make the most of it. I will put you forward for the\r\nmagistracy of Ohsien, whence you may be able to advance.’ So Kan Ning\r\ngot away from Hsiakʻou and would have come to you then, but he feared\r\nthat he would not be welcomed, since he had assisted Huang Tsu and\r\nkilled Ling Tsʻao. I told him you were always ready to welcome able men\r\nand would nourish no resentment for former deeds. After all, every man\r\nwas bound to do his best for his master. He would come with alacrity if\r\nhe only felt sure of a welcome. I pray you to express your pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThis was good news for Sun Chʻüan and he said, “With his help I could\r\ndestroy Huang Tsu.” Then he bade Lü Mêng bring Kan to see him.\r\n\r\nWhen the salutations were over, the chief said, “My heart is entirely\r\ncaptivated by your coming; I feel no resentment against you. I hope you\r\nwill have no doubts on that score and I may as well tell you that I\r\ndesire some plan for the destruction of Huang Tsu.”\r\n\r\nHe replied, “The dynasty is decadent and without influence. Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nwill finally absorb the country down to the river unless he is opposed.\r\nLiu Piao provides nothing against the future and his sons are quite\r\nunfitted to succeed him. You should lay your plans to oust him at once\r\nbefore Tsʻao Tsʻao anticipates you. The first attack should be made on\r\nHuang Tsu, who is getting old and avaricious, so that every one hates\r\nhim. He is totally unprepared for a fight and his army is\r\nundisciplined. He would fall at the first blow. If he were gone, you\r\nwould control the western passes and could conquer Pa and Shu\r\n(Szechʻuan). And you would be securely established.”\r\n\r\n“The advice is most valuable,” said Sun Chʻüan, and he made his\r\npreparations. Chou Yü was appointed Commander-in-Chief; Lü Mêng was\r\nvan-leader; Tung Hsi and Kan Ning were sub-leaders. Sun Chʻüan himself\r\nwould command the main army of ten legions.\r\n\r\nThe spies reported that Huang Tsu, at the news of an expedition against\r\nhim, called his officers together to consult. He placed Su Fei in chief\r\ncommand. He also appointed van-leaders, and other officers, and\r\nprepared for defence. He had two squadrons of ships under the command\r\nof Chʻên Chiu and Têng Lung. On these he placed strong bows and stiff\r\ncrossbows to the number of more than a thousand and secured the boats\r\nto heavy hawsers so that they formed a barrier in the river.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of the men of Wu the drums beat for the ships to\r\nattack. Soon arrows and bolts flew thick, forcing back the invaders,\r\nwho withdrew till several li of water lay between them and the\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\n“We must go forward,” said Kan Ning to his colleague.\r\n\r\nSo they chose a hundred light craft and put picked men on them, fifty\r\nto a boat. Twenty were to row the boats and thirty to fight. These\r\nlatter were armoured swordsmen. Careless of the enemy’s missiles these\r\nboats advanced, got to the defenders’ fleet and cut the hawsers of\r\ntheir ships so that they drifted hither and thither in confusion. Kan\r\nNing leaped upon one boat and killed Têng Lung. Chʻên Chiu left the\r\nfleet and set out for the shore. Lü Mêng dropped into a small boat and\r\nwent among the larger ships setting them on fire. When Chʻên Chiu had\r\nnearly reached the bank, Lü reckless of death went after him, got ahead\r\nand struck him full in the breast so that he fell.\r\n\r\nBefore long Su Fei came along the bank with reinforcements, but it was\r\ntoo late; the armies of Wu had already landed and there was no hope of\r\nrepelling them. Su Fei fled into the open country, but he was made\r\nprisoner. He was taken to Sun Chʻüan who ordered that he be put into a\r\ncage-cart and kept till Huang Tsu should be captured. Then he would\r\nexecute the pair. And the attack was pressed; day and night they\r\nwrought to capture Hsiakʻou.\r\n\r\n\r\n        He sees his ships cut loose and burned,\r\n        By the “Silk-sailed Pirate” he once spurned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Huang Tsu’s fate, see next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nAT CHINGCHOU THE SON OF LIU PIAO THRICE BEGS ADVICE:\r\nAT POWANG SLOPE THE MASTER DIRECTS HIS FIRST BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Sun Chʻüan fought against Hsiakʻou. When Huang Tsu recognised that\r\nhe was beaten and could not maintain his position, he abandoned\r\nChianghsia and took the road to Chingchou. Kan Ning, foreseeing this,\r\nhad laid an ambush outside the east gate. Soon after the fugitive, with\r\na small following, had burst out of the gate he found his road blocked.\r\n\r\nFrom horseback, Huang Tsu said, “I treated you well in the past, why do\r\nyou now press me so hard?”\r\n\r\nKan Ning angrily shouted, “I did good service for you and yet you\r\ntreated me as a pirate. Now what have you to say?”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be said, and Huang turned his horse to escape. But\r\nKan Ning thrust aside his men and himself rode in pursuit. Then he\r\nheard a shouting in his rear and saw Chʻêng Pʻu coming up. Fearing lest\r\nthis other pursuer should overpass him and score the success he desired\r\nfor himself, Kan fitted an arrow to his bow and shot at the fugitive.\r\nHuang was hit and fell from his steed. Then Kan Ning cut off his head.\r\nAfter this, joining himself to Chʻêng Pʻu, the two returned bearing the\r\nghastly trophy to their lord. Sun Chʻüan ordered them to place it in a\r\nbox to be taken back home and offered as a sacrifice to the manes of\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nHaving rewarded the soldiers for the victory and promoted Kan Ning, Sun\r\nChʻüan next discussed the advisability of sending a force to hold\r\nChianghsia. But his adviser, Chang Chao, said it was useless to try to\r\nhold one city alone. It would be better to return home and prepare for\r\nthe expedition that Liu Piao would surely send in revenge. They would\r\ndefeat him, push home the attack and capture his district.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan saw the advice was wise so he left Chianghsia and led his\r\narmy home to the east.\r\n\r\nNow Su Fei was still confined, but he got some one to go to Kan Ning to\r\nbeg him to plead for mercy. Kan Ning had expected this although the\r\nprisoner had said no word and he was averse from leaving his friend and\r\none-time protector to perish. “I should not have forgotten him even if\r\nhe had said nothing,” said Kan.\r\n\r\nWhen the army had reached Wuhui the victor gave orders for Su Fei’s\r\nexecution that his head might be offered with that of Huang Tsu. Then\r\nKan Ning went in to his lord and said, weeping, “Long ago, if it had\r\nnot been for Su Fei, my bones would have been rotting in some ditch and\r\nhow then could I have rendered service under your banner? Now he\r\ndeserves death, but I cannot forget his kindness to me and I pray you\r\ntake away the honours you have bestowed on me as a set-off to his\r\ncrime.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan replied, “Since he once showed kindness to you, I will\r\npardon him for your sake. But what can be done if he run away?”\r\n\r\n“If he be pardoned and escape death he will be immeasurably grateful\r\nand will not go away. If he should, then will I offer my life in\r\nexchange.”\r\n\r\nSo the condemned man escaped death and only one head was offered in\r\nsacrifice. After the sacrificial ceremonies a great banquet was spread\r\nin honour of the victories. As it was proceeding suddenly one of the\r\nguests burst into loud lamentations, drew his sword and rushed upon Kan\r\nNing. Kan hastily rose and defended himself with the chair on which he\r\nhad been sitting. The host looked at the assailant and saw it was Ling\r\nTʻung, whose father had fallen under an arrow shot by Kan Ning. The son\r\nwas now burning to avenge his father’s death.\r\n\r\nHastily leaving his place, Sun Chʻüan checked the angry officer,\r\nsaying, “If he slew your noble father, then remember each was fighting\r\nfor his lord for whom he was bound to exert himself to the utmost. But\r\nnow that you are under one flag and are of one house you may not recall\r\nan ancient injury. You must regard my interests continually.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Ling beat his head upon the floor and cried, saying, “But how can\r\nI not avenge this? It is a blood feud and we may not both live under\r\nthe same sky.”\r\n\r\nThe guests interfered, beseeching the man to forgo his revenge, and at\r\nlast he ceased from his murderous intention. But he sat glaring\r\nwrathfully at his enemy.\r\n\r\nSo soon after Kan Ning was despatched with half a legion and a squadron\r\nof ships to guard Hsiakʻou, where he was beyond the reach of his\r\nenemy’s wrath. Then Sun Chʻüan promoted Tsʻao Ling and so he was\r\nsomewhat appeased.\r\n\r\nFrom about this time Wu enlarged her fleets, and men were sent to\r\nvarious points to guard the river banks. The brother of the chieftain\r\nwas placed in command at Wuhui and Sun Chʻüan himself, with a large\r\narmy, camped at Chʻaisang. Chou Yü, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nforces, was on the Pʻoyang Lake training the naval forces, and general\r\npreparations were made for defence and attack.\r\n\r\nHere our story digresses to follow the adventures of Liu Pei. By his\r\nspies he had tidings of the doings in the lower portion of the great\r\nriver, and knew of the death of Huang Tsu. So he consulted Kʻung-ming\r\nas to his action. While they were discussing matters, there arrived a\r\nmessenger from Liu Piao, begging Liu Pei to go to see him. Kʻung-ming\r\nadvised him to go and said, “This call is to consult you about avenging\r\nHuang Tsu. You must take me with you and let me act as the\r\ncircumstances direct. There are advantages to be got.”\r\n\r\nLeaving his second brother in command at Hsinyeh, Liu Pei set forth,\r\ntaking Chang Fei with half a company as his escort. On the way he\r\ndiscussed the course of action with his adviser, who said, “First you\r\nmust thank him for having saved you from the evil that was planned\r\nagainst you at Hsiangyang. But you must not undertake any expedition\r\nagainst Wu; say you must return to Hsinyeh to put your army in good\r\norder.”\r\n\r\nWith this admonition Liu Pei came to Chingchou and was lodged in the\r\nguest-house. Chang Fei and the escort camped without the walls. In due\r\ncourse Liu Pei and Kʻung-ming were received, and after the customary\r\nsalutations, the guest apologised for his conduct.\r\n\r\nThe host said, “Worthy brother, I know you were the victim of a vile\r\nplot and I should have put the prime mover to death for it had there\r\nnot been so universal a prayer for mercy. However, I remitted that\r\npenalty. I hope you do not consider that I was wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Mao had little to do with it; I think it was due to his subordinates,”\r\nreplied Pei.\r\n\r\nPiao said, “Chianghsia is lost, as you know; Huang is dead. So I have\r\nasked you to come that we might take measures of vengeance.”\r\n\r\n“Huang was harsh and cruel and never used his men in the proper way;\r\nthat was the real cause of his fall. But have you reflected what Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao may do on the north if we attack the south?”\r\n\r\n“I am getting old and weak and I am unable to manage affairs properly;\r\nwill you aid me, brother? After I am gone you will have this district.\r\n\r\n“Why do you say this, my brother? Think you that I am equal to such a\r\ntask?”\r\n\r\nHere Kʻung-ming glanced at Liu Pei who continued, “But give me a little\r\ntime to think it over.”\r\n\r\nAnd at this point he took his leave. When they had reached their\r\nlodging, Kʻung-ming said, “Why did you decline his offer of the\r\ndistrict?”\r\n\r\n“He has always been most kind and courteous. I could not take advantage\r\nof his weakness.”\r\n\r\n“A perfectly kindly and gracious lord,” sighed Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nSoon after the son of Liu Piao was announced and Liu Pei received him\r\nand led him in. The young man began to weep saying, “My mother cannot\r\nbear the sight of me. My very life is in danger. Can you not save me,\r\nUncle?”\r\n\r\n“My worthy nephew, this is a family affair. You should not come to me.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming, who was present, smiled. Liu Pei turned to him to know what\r\nhe should do.\r\n\r\n“This is a family affair; I cannot touch it!” replied Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nThe young man soon left and when Yüan-tê was saying good-bye he\r\nwhispered, “I will get Kʻung-ming to return your call and you can talk\r\nwith him. He will advise you.”\r\n\r\nLiu Chi thanked him and left. Next day when the call was to be returned\r\nYüan-tê pretended to be suffering from colic and made that an excuse to\r\nsend Kʻung-ming to return the call. The adviser went, and when he had\r\nreached the Palace, dismounted and was led in, Liu Chi conducted him\r\ninto one of the inner rooms and when the tea had been brought, said, “I\r\nam an object of my stepmother’s dislike; can you advise me what to do?”\r\n\r\n“As a mere stranger guest I can hardly have anything to do with your\r\nown ‘bone and flesh’ matters. If I did, and the story got abroad, much\r\nharm might ensue.”\r\n\r\nWith this he rose to take leave. But Chi was unwilling to say farewell.\r\nHe said, “Your glory has turned in my direction, you cannot mean to go\r\naway so pointlessly.”\r\n\r\nHe led his visitor into a private chamber and had refreshments brought.\r\nWhile they ate and drank Chi repeated his first request: what was he to\r\ndo since his stepmother disliked him?\r\n\r\n“It is not the sort of thing I can advise in,” replied Kʻung-ming, as\r\nhe rose for the second time to take leave.\r\n\r\n“Master, if you will not reply, that is well. But why incontinently\r\nleave me?”\r\n\r\nSo the adviser once more seated himself and Liu Chi said, “There is an\r\nancient writing I should like to show you.” And he led his visitor to a\r\nsmall upper room.\r\n\r\n“Where is the writing?” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering Liu Chi wept, saying, “My stepmother cannot bear\r\nme; my life is in danger. O Master, will you not say a word to save\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming flushed and rose to go away. But he found the ladder by\r\nwhich they had mounted had been removed. Again Chi besought some\r\nadvice, “Master, you fear lest it may get abroad! Is that why you are\r\nsilent? Here we are between earth and sky and what you say will come\r\nout of your mouth directly into my ear. No other soul can hear. Now can\r\nyou tell me what to do?”\r\n\r\n“Sow not dissension among relatives,” said Kʻung-ming. “Is it possible\r\nfor me to make any plan for you?”\r\n\r\n“Then is my life indeed in danger,” said the young man. “I will die at\r\nyour feet.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he pulled out a dagger and threatened to make an end of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming checked him. “There is a way,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I pray you tell me.”\r\n\r\n“You have heard of Shên Shêng and Chʻung Erh, have you not? Shên Shêng\r\nstayed at home and died; his brother went away and lived in peace. Now\r\nthat Huang Tsu is gone and Chianghsia is weakly defended, why do you\r\nnot ask to be sent there to guard it? Then you would be out of the way\r\nof harm.”\r\n\r\nChi thanked him. Then he called to his people to restore the ladder and\r\nhe escorted Kʻung-ming down to the level ground.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming returned to Yüan-tê and related the whole interview. The\r\nyoung man soon acted on the advice given him, but his father would not\r\nat first consent to let him go. To settle his doubts he sent for\r\nYüan-tê, who said, “Chianghsia is important and your son is the most\r\nsuitable man to defend it. You must let him go. The south-east will be\r\ndefended by your son; the north-west I will look after.”\r\n\r\n“I hear that Tsʻao Tsʻao has been training a naval force and I am\r\nafraid he has intentions against us. We must be on our guard.”\r\n\r\n“I know all about it; you need feel no anxiety,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nHe took leave of his relative and went home while Liu Chi received\r\ncommand of three companies and went to guard Chianghsia.\r\n\r\nAt this time Tsʻao Tsʻao suppressed the three high officers of State\r\nand exercised their functions himself. He appointed as his general\r\nsecretaries or Tsʻao-chʻuan, Mao Chieh and Tsʻui Yen, and as literary\r\nsecretary, Ssŭma I, grandson of Ssŭma Sui and son of Ssŭma Fang. Thus\r\nhe was strong in literary talent.\r\n\r\nHe then called his military officers to a council to discuss an\r\nexpedition against the south. Hsiahou Tun opened the debate saying,\r\n“Liu Fei is drilling his army at Hsinyeh, and is a source of danger. He\r\nshould be destroyed.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly he was appointed Commander-in-Chief and four assistants\r\nwere given him. With these he led ten legions to Powangchʻêng, whence\r\nhe could observe Hsinyeh.\r\n\r\nHsün Yü was opposed to this and said, “Liu Pei is a famous warrior and\r\nhe has lately taken to himself as his director of training Chuko Liang.\r\nCaution is needed.”\r\n\r\nTun replied, “Liu Pei is a mean rat. I will certainly take him\r\nprisoner.”\r\n\r\n“Do not despise him,” said Hsü Shu. “Remember he has Chuko Liang to\r\nhelp him and so he is like a tiger who has grown wings.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said, “Who is this Chuko Liang?”\r\n\r\n“He is also called Kʻung-ming, and has taken a Taoist cognomen of\r\n‘Sleeping Dragon.’ He is a perfect genius, god and devil combined, the\r\ngreatest marvel of the age. Do not despise him.”\r\n\r\n“How does he stand as compared with you?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“There is no comparison. I am a mere glow-worm spark; he is the glory\r\nof the full moon,” replied Hsü Shu.\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken,” replied Tun. “This Chuko Liang of yours is of no\r\naccount. Who would fear him? If I do not take him and his master\r\nprisoners in the first battle, then here is my head, a free gift to our\r\nlord, the minister.”\r\n\r\n“Hasten to comfort me with news of victory,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHsiahou Tun hastened to depart.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Kʻung-ming and the extravagant deference shown him did\r\nnot please Liu Pei’s sworn brothers who grumbled, saying, “He is very\r\nyoung although he is clever and learned. Our brother really treats him\r\ntoo well. We have not seen any evidence of his wonderful skill.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “You do not know his worth. To me it seems as if the\r\nfish had got into the water again. Pray do not discuss this matter\r\nfurther, my brothers.”\r\n\r\nThey withdrew, silent but dissatisfied. One day a man presented Liu Pei\r\nwith a yak’s tail and he at once put it in his cap as an ornament.\r\nKʻung-ming came in and noticed it at once. “Then you have renounced all\r\nambition, my lord; you are just going to attend to this sort of thing,”\r\nhe quietly remarked.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê snatched off his cap and flung it away. “I was only amusing\r\nmyself with the thing,” replied he.\r\n\r\n“How do you think you stand compared with Tsʻao Tsʻao?” asked\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“Inferior.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; your army is less than one legion and the chances are ten\r\nthousand to one that he will attack. How can we meet him?”\r\n\r\n“I am greatly distressed about it; but I see no way.”\r\n\r\n“You might recruit and I will train them. Then we might be able to\r\noppose him.”\r\n\r\nSo recruiting began and three companies were enlisted. Kʻung-ming set\r\nabout drilling them diligently.\r\n\r\nSoon they heard that Hsiahou Tun was leading an army of ten legions\r\nagainst them. When he heard it Chang Fei said to his brother, Kuan Yü,\r\n“We will get this Kʻung-ming to go and fight them.”\r\n\r\nJust at that moment they were summoned to their brother, who asked\r\ntheir advice.\r\n\r\n“Why not send the ‘Water’ brother?” said Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“For method I rely on Kʻung-ming; but for action I put my faith in you,\r\nmy brothers. Are you going to fail me?”\r\n\r\nThey went out and Kʻung-ming was called. “I fear your brothers will not\r\nobey me,” said Kʻung-ming. “Wherefore, if I am to direct the campaign,\r\nyou must give me a seal of office and a sword of authority.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê gave him both. Armed with these ensigns of power he\r\nassembled the officers to receive their orders.\r\n\r\n“We will go just to see what he will do,” said one brother to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the assembly Kʻung-ming spoke saying, “On the left of Powang are\r\nhills called Yüshan. On the right is a forest, Anlin. There we will\r\nprepare an ambush. Kuan Yü will go to the former place with one\r\ncompany. He will remain there quiescent till the enemy has passed, but\r\nwhen he sees a flame in the south, that will be the signal to attack.\r\nHe will first burn their baggage train. Chang Fei will go to a valley\r\nbehind the forest. When he sees the signal he is to go to the old\r\nstores depôt at Powang and burn that. Kuan Pʻing and Liu Fêng will take\r\nhalf a company each, prepare combustibles and be ready with them beyond\r\nPowang Slope. The enemy will arrive about dusk and then they can start\r\nthe blaze.”\r\n\r\n“Chao Yün, now recalled from Fanchʻêng, is to lead the attack, but he\r\nis to lose and not win. And Liu Pei is to command the reserve. See that\r\neach one obeys these orders and let there be no mistakes.”\r\n\r\nThen said Kuan Yü, “All of us are to go out to meet the enemy, but I\r\nhave not yet heard what you are going to do.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to guard the city.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei burst into a laugh, “We are to go out to bloody battle and\r\nyou are to stay quietly at home quite comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the sword and here the seal,” replied the strategist,\r\ndisplaying the emblems of authority. “Disobedience of orders will be\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei said, “Do you not understand that the plans elaborated in a\r\nlittle chamber decide success over thousands of li? Do not disobey the\r\ncommand, my brothers.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei went out smiling cynically.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü remarked, “Let us await the result. If he fail then we can look\r\nto it.”\r\n\r\nThe brothers left. None of the officers understood anything of the\r\ngeneral line of strategy and, though they obeyed orders, they were not\r\nwithout doubts and misgivings.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming said to Liu Pei, “You may now lead your men to the hills and\r\ncamp till the enemy shall arrive to-morrow evening. Then you are to\r\nabandon the camp and move away retreating till the signal is seen. Then\r\nyou will advance and attack with all force. The two Mi and I will guard\r\nthe city.”\r\n\r\nIn the city he prepared banquets to celebrate the victory and also\r\nprepared the books to record exceptional services. Liu Pei noted all\r\nthese things with not a little trouble in his heart.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s army in due course reached Powang. Then half of them, the\r\nveterans, were told off for the first attack and the remainder were to\r\nguard the baggage train and supplies. Thus they marched in two\r\ndivisions. The season was autumn and a chilly wind began to blow.\r\n\r\nThey pressed forward. Presently they saw a cloud of dust ahead of them\r\nand the general ordered the ranks to be reformed. He questioned the\r\nguides as to the name of the place. They told him the place in front\r\nwas Powang Slope and behind them was the Lokʻou Stream. Then Hsiahou\r\nTun rode to the front to reconnoitre, leaving Yü Chin and Li Tien to\r\nfinish setting out the battle array.\r\n\r\nPresently he began to laugh and, when they asked the cause of this\r\nmerriment, he replied, “Hsü Shu praised Chuko Liang to the very skies\r\nas something more than human. But now that I see how he has placed his\r\nmen and the stuff he has put into his vanguard, it seems to me that he\r\nis sending dogs or sheep against tigers and leopards. I bragged a\r\nlittle when I said I would take him prisoner, but I am going to make\r\ngood my boast.”\r\n\r\nThen he rode forward at full speed. Chao Yün rode to meet him and Tun\r\nopened a volley of abuse. “You lot, followers of Liu Pei, are only like\r\nwraiths following devils.”\r\n\r\nThis angered Chao Yün and a combat began. In a little time Chao Yün\r\nturned and retreated as if he was worsted. Tun pressed after him and\r\nkept up the chase for some ten li. Then Chao suddenly turned again and\r\noffered fight; but only to retreat after a few passes.\r\n\r\nSeeing these tactics Han Hao, one of Tun’s captains, rode up to his\r\nchief and urged him to use caution saying he feared he was being\r\ninveigled into an ambush.\r\n\r\n“With such antagonists as these I should not fear a score of ambushes,”\r\nreplied Tun, pressing forward eagerly.\r\n\r\nJust as he reached the slope he heard the roar of a bomb and out came\r\nLiu Pei to attack. “Here is your ambush,” said Hsiahou Tun, laughing.\r\n“I will get to Hsinyeh this evening before I have done.”\r\n\r\nHe urged his men forward and his opponents retired in measure as he\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nAs evening came on, thick clouds overcast the whole sky. The wind\r\nincreased but the leader still urged his men after the retreating foe.\r\nThe two captains came to a narrow part of the road with reeds and\r\nrushes thick all round them.\r\n\r\n“Those who despise the enemy are beaten,” said Li Tien to Yü Chin.\r\n“Away south there the roads are narrow, and streams and mountains make\r\nthe country difficult. The forests are dense and if the enemy used fire\r\nwe should be lost.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” replied Chin. “I will get on and warn the Commander.\r\nPerhaps he will stop. You can halt those who come up.”\r\n\r\nYü Chin rode forward shouting at the top of his voice. Hsiahou Tun saw\r\nhim coming up and asked what was the matter. Chin told him of the state\r\nof the country and reminded him of the danger of fire. His ferocity had\r\nthen somewhat abated and he turned his steed toward his main body.\r\n\r\nThen there arose a shout behind him. A rushing noise came from in the\r\nreeds and great tongues of flame shot up here and there. These spread\r\nand soon the fire was in “the four quarters and the eight sides,” and\r\nfanned by a strong wind.\r\n\r\nThe Tsʻao troops were thrown into confusion and trampled each other\r\ndown. Many perished. Chao Yün turned on them again. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief dashed through the fire and smoke to escape.\r\n\r\nNow Li Tien saw that things were going very badly so he turned to get\r\nback to Powangchʻêng but fell upon a body of men in the way, led by\r\nKuan Yü. He dashed into their midst and managed to get clear. Yü Chin\r\nsaw the supplies were being destroyed and there was nothing left to\r\nguard, so he escaped along a bye-path. Two other captains, who came to\r\ntry to save the baggage train, met Chang Fei and one of them was slain\r\nforthwith, but the other escaped. Next morning the countryside was\r\nstrewn with corpses and drenched with blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The armies met on Powang Slope\r\n          And Kʻung-ming fought with fire;\r\n        A perfect strategist, he bent\r\n          All men to his desire.\r\n        But poor Tsʻao Tsʻao, his enemy,\r\n          He trembled in his shoes\r\n        Before the man, who’d never fought\r\n          But yet could armies use.\r\n\r\n\r\nHsiahou Tung drew up the battered remains of his army and led them back\r\nto the capital.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming ordered his armies to collect, and as Kuan and Chang rode\r\nhomeward they confessed to each other that the new strategist was a\r\nfine fellow. Before long they met him seated in a light carriage and\r\nthey dismounted and bowed before him. The remaining bodies came in. The\r\nspoil was distributed among the soldiers and all returned to Hsinyeh,\r\nwhere the populace lined the roads to bid them welcome.\r\n\r\n“We owe our lives to the Prince,” they cried to Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nSaid Kʻung-ming, “Hsiahou Tun has been driven off, but Tsʻao Tsʻao will\r\ncome with a stronger force.”\r\n\r\n“And what shall we do?” replied Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“My plan is quite ready,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Always battles, nowhere rest for horse or man;\r\n        Must rely on ruses, dodging where one can.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan prepared against Tsʻao Tsʻao will be unfolded in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE LADY TSʻAI DISCUSSES THE RENUNCIATION OF CHINGCHOU:\r\nCHUKO LIANG BURNS HSINYEH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê asked how his adviser hoped to repel Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “This is a small city and unfitted for our lengthy\r\noccupation. Liu Piao is ill and failing fast, so this is the time to\r\ntake his district as a base where we may be safe against Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“You speak well, Master, but Liu Piao has shown me great kindness and I\r\ncould not bear to serve him an ill turn.”\r\n\r\n“If you do not take this opportunity you will regret it ever after,”\r\nsaid Kʻung-ming,\r\n\r\n“I would rather perish than do what is wrong.”\r\n\r\n“We will discuss it again,” replied Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nWhen Hsiahou Tun reached the capital he presented himself to his master\r\nin bonds and craved death. But his master loosed him and let him tell\r\nhis tale. And he said, “I was the victim of Chuko Liang’s evil\r\nmachinations; he attacked with fire.”\r\n\r\n“As a soldier from your youth you should have remembered that fire was\r\na likely weapon in narrow roads.”\r\n\r\n“Li Tien and Yü Chin reminded me; I am sorry enough now.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao rewarded his two captains who had warned their leader.\r\n\r\n“Liu Pei as strong as he is now certainly is a menace to our existence\r\nand he must be quickly destroyed,” said Hsiahou Tun.\r\n\r\n“He is one of my anxieties,” replied Tsʻao. “Sun Chʻüan is the other.\r\nThe rest do not count. We must take this chance to sweep the south\r\nclean.”\r\n\r\nThen orders were issued to prepare an army of fifty legions, in five\r\ndivisions of ten legions each. Each had two leaders, except the fifth,\r\nwhich Tsʻao Tsʻao himself led. The van was commanded by Hsü Chʻu. The\r\nseventh moon of the thirteenth year was fixed for the march.\r\n\r\nThe high officer, Kʻung Jung, offered a remonstrance. He said, “Liu Pei\r\nand Liu Piao are both of the Imperial House and should not be attacked\r\nwithout grave reasons. Sun Chʻüan in the six districts is terrible as a\r\ncrouching tiger and, with the Great River as his defence, he is very\r\nsecure. If, Sir Minister, you undertake this unjustifiable expedition,\r\nyou will forfeit the respect of the world, I fear.”\r\n\r\n“All three of them are disobedient ministers and rebels and how can I\r\nfail to punish them?” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHe was angry, and bade the adviser go from his presence. Presently he\r\ngave formal orders that he would put to death any one who remonstrated\r\non the subject of his expedition.\r\n\r\nKʻung Jung went forth from the palace sadly. Casting his eyes up to\r\nheaven, he cried, “Where is the chance of success when the perfectly\r\ninhumane attacks the perfectly humane? He must be defeated.”\r\n\r\nOne of the clients of the historian Chʻi Lü, whom Kʻung Jung had always\r\ntreated contemptuously and disdainfully, happened to hear this\r\napostrophe and told his patron who carried the tale to Tsʻao Tsʻao. He\r\nalso added to it that Kʻung habitually spoke disrespectfully of the\r\nChief Minister and had been very friendly with Mi Hêng. In fact the\r\ninsults that Mi Hêng had hurled at Tsʻao Tsʻao had been deliberately\r\narranged and intrigued by Kʻung. Kʻung Jung and Mi Hêng seemed to\r\nadmire each other hugely and Mi used to say, “Confucius is not dead”\r\nand the other used to reply “Yen Hui has risen again.”\r\n\r\nChʻi Lü’s tale angered Tsʻao, who ordered the arrest of the historian\r\nand sent Tʻing Wei to carry it out.\r\n\r\nNow Kʻung Jung had two sons, both young, who were sitting at home\r\nplaying wei-chʻi, when one of their servants ran in and said, “Your\r\nfather has just been carried off for execution; why do you not run\r\naway?”\r\n\r\nThe youths replied, “When the nest is pulled down are the eggs left\r\nunbroken?”\r\n\r\nEven at that moment the same officer came and carried off the whole\r\nhousehold. The two youths were beheaded. The father’s corpse was\r\nexposed in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of the Metropolis, Chih Hsi, wept over the corpse. This\r\npublic exhibition of sympathy re-kindled Tsʻao’s anger and he was going\r\nto punish it with death. However, this additional cruelty was prevented\r\nby the adviser Hsün Yü, who said, “You should not slay a righteous man\r\nwho came to mourn over his friend’s corpse. He had often warned his\r\nfriend, Kʻung Jung, against the danger his severe rectitude might lead\r\nhim into.”\r\n\r\nChih Hsi took up the remains of father and sons and buried them.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Kʻung Jung, who dwelt on the north sea shore,\r\n        A noble reputation bore;\r\n        With him all guests warm welcome found,\r\n        And ceaselessly the wine went round.\r\n        For skill in letters he was famed,\r\n        In speech, he dukes and princes shamed,\r\n        Historians his merits tell,\r\n        Recorders say that he did well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter wreaking his wrath on Kʻung Jung, Tsʻao issued the order to\r\nmarch. Hsün Yü was left in command of the capital.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Prefect of Chingchou became seriously ill and he\r\nsummoned Liu Pei to his chamber. He went accompanied by his two\r\nbrothers and the adviser. Liu Piao said, “The disease has attacked my\r\nvery vitals and my time is short. I confide my orphans to your\r\nguardianship. My son is unfit to succeed to my place, and I pray you,\r\nmy brother, to administer the district after my death.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei wept, saying, “I will do my utmost to help my nephew; what else\r\ncould I do, indeed?”\r\n\r\nEven at this moment came the news of the march of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s armies\r\nand Liu Pei, taking hasty leave of his kinsman, was forced to hurry to\r\nhis station. The evil tidings aggravated the sick man’s condition and\r\nhe began to make his last arrangements. In his testament he appointed\r\nYüan-tê the guardian of his son Liu Chi, who was to succeed in the\r\nlordship.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement greatly angered his wife the Lady Tsʻai. She closed\r\nthe inner doors against all and confided to her own partizans, of whom\r\nher brother and Chang Yün were her confidants, the keeping of the outer\r\ngates.\r\n\r\nThe heir was at Chianghsia and he came to make filial enquiries as soon\r\nas his father’s condition became serious. But Tsʻai Mao refused him\r\nadmittance and said, “Your father sent you to guard Chianghsia. Such a\r\nvery responsible post should by no means have been quitted without\r\norders. Suppose it was attacked, what might not happen? If your father\r\nsees you he will be very angry and it will make him worse. That would\r\nbe most undutiful and you should return to your command at once.”\r\n\r\nLiu Chi stood out for some time, but admittance was denied him in spite\r\nof his tears. So he returned to his post. Meanwhile his father rapidly\r\ngrew worse. He anxiously looked for his son, but he came not. Suddenly\r\nhe uttered piercing shrieks and then passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n        When the Yüans were lords of the north,\r\n        And Piao held the bank of the river,\r\n        It seemed, so strong were they both,\r\n        That they would endure for ever.\r\n        But the women folk troubled their states,\r\n        And, meddling, confusion made;\r\n        It was mournful indeed to see\r\n        How quickly the house decayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Prefect died. Then the widow and her partizans took counsel\r\ntogether and forged a testament conferring the lordship of Chingchou on\r\nthe second son Liu Tsʻung before they published the news of the death.\r\n\r\nThe wrongful heir was then fourteen years of age. He was no fool, so he\r\nassembled the officials and said, “My father has passed away and my\r\nelder brother is at Chianghsia. More than that, our uncle is at\r\nHsinyeh. You have made me lord, but if my brother and uncle come here\r\nwith an army to punish me for usurping the lordship, what explanation\r\ncan I offer?”\r\n\r\nAt first no one replied. Then a secretary Li Kuei, rose and said, “You\r\nspeak well. Now hasten to send letters of mourning to your brother and\r\nask him to come and take his inheritance. Also call upon Yüan-tê to\r\ncome and assist in the administration. Then shall we be safe against\r\nour enemies on both north and south. I consider this the most excellent\r\nplan.”\r\n\r\nBut Tsʻai Mao replied harshly, “Who are you to speak thus wildly and\r\noppose the testament of our late lord?”\r\n\r\nLi began to abuse him, “You and your party have fabricated this\r\ntestament, setting aside the rightful heir. Now the whole district is\r\nin the hands of the Tsʻai family and if our dead lord knew your doings\r\nhe would slay you.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao ordered the lictors to take him away to execution. He was\r\nhurried out, but his tongue ceased not.\r\n\r\nSo the younger son was placed in his father’s seat and the Tsʻai clan\r\nshared among them the whole military authority of the district. The\r\ndefence of Chingchou was confided to Têng I and Liu Hsien, while Lady\r\nTsʻai and her son took up their residence in Hsiangyang so as to be out\r\nof the reach of the rightful heir and his uncle. They interred the\r\nremains of the late Prefect on the east of Hsiangyang. No notice of the\r\ndeath was sent to Liu Chi, the son, or to his uncle.\r\n\r\nLiu Tsʻung arrived at Hsiangyang, but, before he had had time to\r\nrecover from the fatigue of the journey, the startling news of the\r\napproach of a great army came in. He summoned Kʻuai Yüeh and Tsʻai Mao\r\nand others to ask counsel. One of the secretaries, Fu Sun, offered his\r\nadvice, saying, “Not only are we threatened by a great army, but the\r\nelder son, who is the real heir, at Chianghsia, and his uncle at\r\nHsinyeh, are to be reckoned with. These two have not been notified of\r\nthe death, and they will resent that. We shall be in sad case if they\r\nalso march against us. But if you will adopt my suggestion then our\r\npeople will be as steady as Mount Tʻai and our young lord’s position\r\nand rank will be assured.”\r\n\r\n“What is your plan?” asked the young lord.\r\n\r\n“To offer the whole district to Tsʻao Tsʻao, who will treat our young\r\nmaster most liberally.”\r\n\r\n“What advice!” said Liu Tsʻung angrily. “Am I to yield my heritage to\r\nanother before I have even fairly succeeded to it?”\r\n\r\n“The advice is good,” said Kʻuai Yüeh. “Opportunism is a policy and\r\npossibilities need consideration. In the name of government, Tsʻao is\r\nfighting against his neighbours. If our lord oppose him he will be\r\ntermed contumacious. Beside, any misfortune on our borders before our\r\nyoung lord is well established will react upon the internal\r\nadministration and our people will be panic-stricken at the mere news\r\nof the approach of a hostile army. How could we then offer any\r\nresistance?”\r\n\r\nLiu Tsʻung replied, “It is not that I disagree with you, but I should\r\nbe a laughing-stock to the whole world were I to abandon my heritage\r\nwithout an effort.”\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a speaker who said, “If their advice is good, why\r\nnot follow it?”\r\n\r\nThey turned toward the speaker who was a certain Wang Tsʻan of\r\nShangyang, a lean, cadaverous individual much below the middle height\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\nHowever, his talents did not conform to his physical appearance. When\r\nhe was yet a youth he went to visit Tsʻai Yung, then a vice-president,\r\nand although many guests of exalted rank were present, the host\r\nhastened to welcome the newcomer with the greatest deference. The\r\nothers were astonished and asked why he was so respectful to a mere\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n“He is a young man with the highest gifts; were I only like him——,”\r\nsaid Tsʻai.\r\n\r\nWang was widely read and had a most retentive memory, better than any\r\nof his contemporaries. If he glanced at a roadside monument as he\r\npassed, he remembered every word of the inscription. If he saw people\r\nplaying wei-chʻi and the board was suddenly overthrown, he could\r\nreplace every pip in its proper place. He was a good mathematician and\r\nhis poems were exquisite. At seventeen he was appointed a court\r\nofficial but did not take up the appointment. When the disturbance in\r\nthe empire grew serious he sought refuge in Chingchou, where he was\r\nreceived with great honour as guest of the Prefect.\r\n\r\nWhat he said was this, “General, how do you compare with Tsʻao Tsʻao?”\r\n\r\n“Inferior,” replied Liu Tsʻung.\r\n\r\nWang continued, “Tsʻao has many soldiers and bold leaders; he is able\r\nand resourceful. He took Lü Pu and broke the power of Yüan Shao. He\r\npursued Liu Pei into Lung and destroyed Wu Huan. The destruction of\r\nsuch firmly established men shows his invincible character. Now he is\r\non the way here and it will be very difficult to withstand him. The\r\nplan proposed is the best you can expect and you should not delay and\r\nhesitate till it is too late for aught but regret.”\r\n\r\n“Worthy Sir, you indeed speak to the point; I must inform my mother,”\r\nsaid the young ruler.\r\n\r\nBut just then they saw his mother appear from behind a screen; she had\r\nbeen listening to all that was said.\r\n\r\n“Why refer to me when three such gentlemen coincide in their opinions?”\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\nSo he decided, and the letter of surrender was composed and entrusted\r\nto one Sung Chung to convey secretly to Tsʻao Tsʻao. Sung went straight\r\nto Wanchʻêng and presented the letter. It was received with joy and the\r\nbearer well rewarded. The submission was accepted and Sung was told to\r\ntell his master to go out to meet Tsʻao Tsʻao in the open country and\r\nhe was to be confirmed in perpetual tenure of his land.\r\n\r\nSung Chung left the city and took the homeward way. He had nearly\r\nreached the ferry when he fell in with a party of horse. On a closer\r\nlook he saw the leader was Kuan Yü. The messenger tried to escape\r\nobservation, but was presently captured and taken to the leader to be\r\nquestioned. At first he prevaricated but on being closely questioned\r\ntold the whole story. Then he was carried off to Hsinyeh and made to\r\nretell his story to Liu Pei who heard it with lamentations.\r\n\r\nChang Fei said, “This being so, I propose that we put this fellow to\r\ndeath, then cross the river, attack Hsiangyang and make an end of the\r\nTsʻai tribe and Liu Tsʻung as well. Then we can attack Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nBut Yüan-tê replied, “Just shut your mouth. I have something more to\r\nsay.” Then turning to the prisoner he shouted, “When they did all this\r\nwhy did you not come to tell me? As things are now there is nothing to\r\nbe gained by killing you. You may go.”\r\n\r\nSung Chung stammered his thanks, threw his arms over his head and ran\r\naway. Yüan-tê was very sad.\r\n\r\nPresently a certain I Chi, a messenger from his nephew, was announced.\r\nYüan-tê was very fond of this man and went down the steps to welcome\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen said I Chi, “The heir has heard that his father is dead, but his\r\nstepmother and her family are keeping back the news so that they may\r\nset up Liu Tsʻung. He knows the news is true, as he sent a special\r\nmessenger to find out. He thinks you, O Prince, may not know and has\r\nsent me to inform you and his letter begs you to lead all the men you\r\ncan to Hsiangyang to help him assert his claims.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê opened and read the letter. Then he said, “Yes; you know that\r\nthe younger son has usurped the lordship, but you have not heard that\r\nhe has already sent to offer the district to Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nThis news shocked I Chi. “How know you this?” he asked.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei told of the capture of Sung Chung. Chi said, “You can go to\r\nHsiangyang as if to attend the mourning ceremonies and so draw Liu\r\nTsʻung into coming out of the city to welcome you. Then you can seize\r\nhim, slay his party and take the district.”\r\n\r\n“Your advice is good,” said Kʻung-ming, “and my lord ought to take it.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei wept, saying, “In his last interview my brother confided his\r\nson and heir to my care. If I lay hands upon another son and seize upon\r\nthe inheritance, how shall I be able to look my brother in the face\r\nwhen I meet him by and bye beyond the grave?”\r\n\r\n“If you do not act in this way now how will you repel Tsʻao Tsʻao, who\r\nhas already reached Wanchʻêng?” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“Our best plan is to take refuge in Fanchʻêng,” replied Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nJust about this time the spies came to say that Tsʻao’s army had\r\nreached Powang. So I Chi was sent off with instructions to take\r\nmeasures for the defence of Chianghsia, while Liu Pei and Kʻung-ming\r\ndiscussed plans for meeting the enemy.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming bade his master take heart. As he had seen the last army\r\ndestroyed by fire, so would he see this one also the victim of a ruse.\r\nHe said, “This is no place to live in; we will move over to Fanchʻêng.”\r\n\r\nThen notices were posted at all the gates that all the people, without\r\nany exception, were to follow their rulers at once to the new city to\r\nescape danger. Boats were prepared and the people sent away under the\r\ndirection of Sun Chʻien. Mi Chu saw to the safe conveyance of the\r\nfamilies of the officials.\r\n\r\nThen the officers assembled for orders. Kuan Yü was to go to the White\r\nRiver. His men were to carry bags to fill with sand and earth to dam\r\nthe river till the enemy should be heard, about the third watch next\r\nday. Then the waters were to be freed to drown one of the armies. He\r\nwas then to march down river. Chang Fei was to go to Poling Ferry,\r\nwhere the current was slow. After the waters of the White River had\r\nbeen let loose on Tsʻao’s men they would try to get over the river at\r\nthe ferry. They were to be attacked. Chao Yün was to divide three\r\ncompanies into four parties and take one to the east gate. The other\r\nthree were for the other gates. The roofs of the houses within the city\r\nwalls were piled with sulphur nitre and other combustibles.\r\n\r\nThe intention was to set fire to the city when the army of the enemy\r\nhad entered it for shelter. There would be a strong breeze next day in\r\nthe evening which would fan the flames. When this wind began to blow,\r\nfire arrows were to be shot into the city from all sides. When the\r\nflames were high there was to be a great shouting outside to add to the\r\ngeneral terror. The east gate was to be left free for escape, but the\r\nflying men were to be smitten after passing the gate. Fanchʻêng was the\r\nrallying centre after the battle.\r\n\r\nOther orders were given to Mi Fang and Liu Fêng to take command of two\r\ncompanies, one half with red flags and the other half with black. They\r\nwere to go to Magpie Tail Slope (Hsiwei Pʻo), about thirty li from the\r\ncity and camp. When they saw the Tsʻao army coming along they were to\r\nmove right and left to confuse them so that they should be afraid to\r\nadvance further.\r\n\r\nAll the orders given, the various leaders went their way to take up\r\ntheir positions and await the burning of the city. Kʻung-ming and Liu\r\nPei went away to an eminence whence they could watch what happened and\r\nwhere they would await the reports of victory.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Hung and Tsʻao Jên, with their ten legions, preceded by Hsü Chʻu\r\nleading three companies of mailed men, marched toward Hsinyeh. They\r\nformed a mighty host. They reached Magpie Tail Slope about noon.\r\nLooking ahead, they saw what seemed a goodly army with many black and\r\nred flags. Hsü Chʻu pressed forward. As he neared the flags moved from\r\nside to side and he hesitated. He began to think it unwise to advance\r\nand called a halt. Finally it was decided to go no farther then, and\r\nthe leader rode back to the main body to see Tsʻao Jên.\r\n\r\n“Those men are only make-believe,” said Tsʻao Jên. “Advance, there is\r\nno ambush. I will hasten up the supports.”\r\n\r\nSo Hsü Chʻu rode to his own command again and advanced. When he reached\r\nthe wood where he had seen the flags he saw no one at all. It was then\r\nlate in the afternoon but he decided to move on. Then he heard from the\r\nhills the sound of musical instruments and, looking up, saw on the hill\r\ntop two umbrellas surrounded by many banners. There sat Liu Pei and\r\nKʻung-ming quietly drinking.\r\n\r\nAngry at their coolness, he sought for a way up, but logs of wood and\r\ngreat stones were thrown down and he was driven back. Further, from the\r\nrear of the hills came a confused roar. He could find no way to attack\r\nand it was getting late.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Jên arrived and ordered an attack on Hsinyeh that he might\r\nhave a place to rest in. They marched to the walls and found the gates\r\nwide open. They entered and found a deserted city. No one was visible.\r\n\r\n“This shows they are done,” said Tsʻao Hung, “They have all run away,\r\npeople and all. We may as well occupy the city and rest our men ready\r\nfor the morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were fatigued with marching and hungry as well, so they\r\nlost no time in scattering among the houses and setting about preparing\r\nfood in the deserted kitchens. The leaders took up their quarters in\r\nthe yamên.\r\n\r\nAfter the first watch the wind began to blow. Soon after the gate\r\nguards reported that a fire had started.\r\n\r\n“The careless men have let sparks fly about,” said the General.\r\n\r\nHe thought no more about it just then, but along came other reports of\r\nlike nature and soon he realised that fires breaking out in all\r\nquarters were not due to accident. So he gave orders to evacuate the\r\ncity. Soon the whole city seemed on fire and a red glow hung in the\r\nsky. The army was beset with fire fiercer than it had been at Powang.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Thrice wicked was Tsʻao, but he was bold;\r\n        Though all in the capital he controlled,\r\n        Yet with this he was not content,\r\n        So southward his ravaging army went.\r\n        But, the autumn wind aiding, the Spirit of Fire\r\n        Wrought to his army destruction dire.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficers and men dashing through the smoke and fire in utter confusion\r\nsought some way of escape, and hearing that the east gate was free they\r\nmade for that quarter. Out they rushed pell-mell, many being trodden\r\ndown and trampled to death. Those who got through took the road to the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nBut presently there was a shouting behind them and Chao Yün’s company\r\ncame up and attacked. Then Tsʻao’s men scattered, each fleeing for his\r\nlife. No stand was made. A little later Mi Chu came. The fleeing\r\ngeneral then had very few followers and those left him were scorched\r\nand burned and very wearied.\r\n\r\nThey directed their way to the Paiho, joyfully remembering that the\r\nriver was shallow and fordable. And they went down into the stream and\r\ndrank their fill, men shouting and horses neighing.\r\n\r\nMeantime Kuan Yü, higher up its course, had dammed the river with\r\nsandbags so that its waters were collected in a lake. Toward evening he\r\nhad seen the red glow of the burning city and began to look out for his\r\nsignal. About the fourth watch he heard down stream the sounds of men\r\nand horse and at once ordered the breaking of the dam. The water rushed\r\ndown in a torrent and overwhelmed the men just then in the bed of the\r\nriver. Many were swept away and drowned. Those who escaped made their\r\nway to where the stream ran gently and got away.\r\n\r\nPresently they reached the ferry at Powang. Here, where they thought\r\nthere would be safety, they found the road barred.\r\n\r\n“You Tsʻao brigands!” shouted Chang Fei. “Come and receive your fate!”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Within the city the red flame leaps out:\r\n        On the river bank black anger is met.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happened will appear in later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nLIU PEI LEADS HIS PEOPLE OVER THE RIVER:\r\nCHAO YÜN RESCUES HIS LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter closed with the attack made by Chang Fei as soon as\r\nhis brother had let loose the waters on the doomed army. He met with\r\nHsü Chʻu and a combat began, but a fight with such a warrior was not to\r\nHsü’s taste and he ran away. Chang Fei followed till he came upon Liu\r\nPei and Kʻung-ming and the three went up stream till they came to the\r\nboats that had been prepared, when they all crossed over and marched\r\ntoward Fanchʻêng. As soon as they disembarked Kʻung-ming ordered the\r\nboats and rafts to be burned.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên gathered in the remnants of his army and camped at Hsinyeh,\r\nwhile his colleague went to tell their lord the evil tidings of defeat.\r\n\r\n“How dare he, this rustic fool!” exclaimed Tsʻao Tsʻao angrily.\r\n\r\nHe then hastily sent an overwhelming army to camp near the place and\r\ngave orders for enormous works against the city, levelling hills and\r\nturning rivers to launch a violent assault on Fanchʻêng from every side\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThen Liu Yeh came in to see his lord and said, “Sir, you are new to\r\nthis district and you should win over the people’s hearts. Liu Pei has\r\nmoved all the people from Hsinyeh to Fanchʻêng. If we march through the\r\ncountry, the people will be ground to powder. It would be well to call\r\nupon Liu Pei first to surrender, which will prove to the people that\r\nyou have a care for them. If he yield then we get Chingchou without\r\nfighting.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao agreed and asked who would be a suitable messenger. The reply was\r\nHsü Shu.\r\n\r\n“He is a close friend and he is here with the army,” said Liu Yeh.\r\n\r\n“But he will not come back,” objected Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“If he does not return he will be a laughing stock to the whole world;\r\nhe will come back.”\r\n\r\nHsü Shu was sent for, and Tsʻao said, “My first intention was to level\r\nFanchʻêng with the ground, but out of pity for its people you may carry\r\nan offer to Liu Pei, that if he will surrender he will not only not be\r\npunished but he shall be given rank. But if he hold on his present\r\nmisguided course the whole of his followers shall be destroyed. Now you\r\nare an honest man and so I confide this mission to you, and I trust you\r\nwill not disappoint me.”\r\n\r\nHsü Shu said nothing but accepted his orders and went to the city,\r\nwhere he was received by both Liu Pei and Kʻung-ming. They enjoyed a\r\ntalk over old times before Shu mentioned the object of his mission.\r\nThen he said, “Tsʻao has sent me to invite you to surrender, thereby\r\nmaking a bid for popularity. But you ought also to know that he intends\r\nto attack the city from every point, that he is damming up the Paiho\r\nwaters to be sent against you, and I fear you will not be able to hold\r\nthe city. You ought to prepare.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei asked Shu to remain with them, but he said that that was\r\nimpossible, for all the world would ridicule him if he stayed.\r\n\r\n“My old mother is dead and I never forget my resentment. My body may be\r\nover there, but I swear never to form a plan for him. You have the\r\n‘Sleeping Dragon’ to help you and need have no anxiety about the\r\nultimate achievement of your undertaking. But I must go.”\r\n\r\nAnd he took his leave. Liu Pei felt he could not press his friend to\r\nstay. He returned to Tsʻao Tsʻao’s camp and reported that Liu Pei had\r\nno intention of surrender. This angered Tsʻao who gave orders to begin\r\nthe siege. When Liu Pei asked what Kʻung-ming meant to do he replied\r\nthat they would abandon Fanchʻêng and take Hsiangyang.\r\n\r\n“But what of the people who have followed us? They cannot be\r\nabandoned.”\r\n\r\n“You can tell them to do as they wish. They may come if they like, or\r\nremain here.”\r\n\r\nThey sent Kuan Yü to prepare boats and told Sun Chʻien to proclaim to\r\nthe people that Tsʻao was coming, that the city could not be defended,\r\nand those who wished to do so might cross the river with the army. All\r\nthe people cried, “We will follow the prince even if it be to death.”\r\n\r\nThey started at once, some lamenting, some weeping, the young helping\r\nthe aged and parents leading their children, the strong soldiers\r\ncarrying the women. As the crowds crossed the river from both banks\r\narose the sound of lamentation.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was much affected as he saw all this from the boat. “Why was I\r\never born,” said he, “to be the cause of all this misery to the\r\npeople?”\r\n\r\nHe made to leap overboard, but they held him back. All were deeply\r\nsympathetic. When the boat reached the southern shore he looked back at\r\nthe weeping crowds waiting still on the other bank and was again moved\r\nto tears. He bade Kuan Yü hasten the boats before he mounted and rode\r\non.\r\n\r\nWhen Hsiangyang came in sight they saw many flags flying on the walls\r\nand that the moat was protected by chevaux de frise. Yüan-tê checked\r\nhis horse and called out, “Liu Tsʻung, good nephew, I only wish to save\r\nthe people and nothing more. I pray you quickly to open the gates.”\r\n\r\nBut Liu Tsʻung was too frightened to appear. Tsʻai Mao and Chang Yün\r\nwent up to one of the fighting towers and ordered the soldiers to shoot\r\narrows down on those without the walls. The people gazed up at the\r\ntowers and wept aloud.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there appeared a captain, with a small following, who cried\r\nout, “You are two traitors. The princely Liu is a most upright man and\r\nhas come here to preserve his people. Why do you repulse him?”\r\n\r\nAll looked at this man. He was of middle height, with a face dark brown\r\nas a ripe date. He was from Iyang and named Wei Yen. At that moment he\r\nlooked very terrible, whirling his sword as if about to slice up the\r\ngate guards. They lost no time in throwing open the gate and dropping\r\nthe bridge. “Come in, Uncle Liu,” cried Yen, “and bring your men to\r\nslay these traitors!”\r\n\r\nChang Fei plunged forward to take him at his word, but was checked by\r\nhis brother, who said, “Do not frighten the people!”\r\n\r\nThus Wei Yen let in Liu Pei. As soon as he entered he saw a captain\r\ngalloping up with a few men. The newcomer yelled, “Wei Yen, you nobody!\r\nhow dare you create trouble? Do you not know me, the Generalissimo Wên\r\nPʻing?”\r\n\r\nWei Yen turned angrily, set his spear and galloped forward to attack\r\nthe generalissimo. The soldiers joined in the fray and the noise of\r\nbattle rose to the skies.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to preserve the people and I am only causing them injury,”\r\ncried Yüan-tê distressed. “I do not wish to enter the city.”\r\n\r\n“Chiangling is an important point; we will first take that as a place\r\nto dwell in,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“That pleases me greatly,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSo they led the people thither and away from Hsiangyang. Many of the\r\ninhabitants of that city took advantage of the confusion to escape and\r\nthey also joined themselves to Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, within the inhospitable city, Wei Yen and Wên Pʻing fought.\r\nThe battle continued for four or five hours, all through the middle of\r\nthe day, and nearly all the combatants fell. Then Wei Yen got away. As\r\nhe could not find Yüan-tê he rode off to Chʻangsha and sought an asylum\r\nwith the Prefect, Han Yüan.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê wandered away from the city that had refused shelter. Soldiers\r\nand people, his following numbered more than a hundred thousand. The\r\ncarts numbered scores of thousands, and the burden bearers were\r\ninnumerable. Their road led them past the tomb of Liu Piao and Yüan-tê\r\nturned aside to bow at the grave. He lamented, saying, “Shameful is thy\r\nbrother, lacking both in virtue and in talents. I refused to bear the\r\nburden you wished to lay upon me, wherein I was wrong. But the people\r\ncommitted no sin. I pray your glorious spirit to descend and rescue\r\nthese people.”\r\n\r\nHis prayer was fraught with sorrow and all those about him wept.\r\n\r\nJust then a scout rode up with the news that Fanchʻêng was already\r\noccupied and that men were preparing boats and rafts to cross the\r\nriver. The captains knew that Chiangling was a defensible place, but\r\nthey said, “With this crowd we can only advance very slowly and when\r\ncan we reach the city? If Tsʻao Tsʻao pursue, we shall be in a parlous\r\nstate. Our counsel is to leave the people to their fate for a time and\r\npress on to the city.”\r\n\r\nBut Yüan-tê wept, saying, “The success of every great enterprise\r\ndepends upon humanity; how can I abandon these people who have joined\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nThose who heard him repeat this noble sentiment were greatly affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In time of stress his heart was tender toward the people,\r\n    And he wept as he went down into the ship,\r\n    Moving the hearts of soldiers to sympathy.\r\n    Even to-day, in the countryside,\r\n    Fathers and elders recall the Princely One’s kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of Yüan-tê, with the crowd of people in his train, was\r\nvery slow.\r\n\r\n“The pursuers will be upon us quickly,” said Kʻung-ming. “Let us send\r\nKuan Yü to Chiangkʻou for succour. Liu Chi should be told to bring\r\nsoldiers and prepare boats for us at Chiangling.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê agreed to this and wrote a letter which he sent by the hands of\r\nKuan Yü and Sun Chʻien. Chang Fei was put in command of the rear guard.\r\nChao Yün was told to guard the aged and the children, while the others\r\nordered the march of the people. They only travelled a short distance\r\ndaily and the halts were frequent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tsʻao Tsʻao was at Fanchʻêng, whence he sent soldiers over\r\nthe river toward Hsiangyang. He summoned Liu Tsʻung, but he was too\r\nafraid to answer the call. No persuasion could get him to go. One, Wang\r\nWei, said to him privately, “Now you can overcome Tsʻao Tsʻao if you\r\nare wise. Since you have announced surrender and Liu Pei has gone away,\r\nhe will relax his precautions and you can catch him unawares. Send a\r\nwell-prepared but unexpected force to waylay him in some commanding\r\nposition and the thing is done. If you were to take Tsʻao prisoner your\r\nfame would run throughout the empire and the land would be yours for\r\nthe taking. This is a sort of opportunity that does not recur and you\r\nshould not miss it.”\r\n\r\nThe young man consulted Tsʻai Mao, who called Wang an evil counsellor\r\nand spoke to him harshly. “You are mad; you know nothing and understand\r\nnothing of destiny,” said Mao.\r\n\r\nWang Wei angrily retorted, calling his critic the betrayer of his\r\ncountry, and saying he wished he could eat him alive. The quarrel waxed\r\ndeadly but eventually peace was restored.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻai Mao and Chang Yün went to Fanchʻêng to see Tsʻao Tsʻao. Mao\r\nwas by instinct specious and flattering, and when his host asked\r\nconcerning the resources of the district, he replied, “There are five\r\nlegions of horse, fifteen of foot and eight of marines. Most of the\r\nmoney and grain are at Chiangling; the rest is stored at various\r\nplaces. There are ample supplies for a year.”\r\n\r\n“How many war vessels are there? Who is in command?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“The ships, of all sizes, number seven thousand and we two are the\r\ncommanders.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Tsʻao conferred upon Tsʻai Mao the title of Marquis, Guardian\r\nof the South and Admiral-in-Chief of the Naval Force and Chang Yün was\r\nhis Vice-Admiral with the title of Marquis Tsŭ-shun.\r\n\r\nWhen they went to thank Tsʻao for these honours he told them he was\r\nabout to propose to the throne that Liu Piao’s son should be perpetual\r\nprefect of Chingchou in succession to his late father. With this\r\npromise for their young master and the honours for themselves they\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nThen Hsün Yu asked Tsʻao why these two evident self-seekers and\r\nflatterers had been treated so generously. Tsʻao replied, “Do I not\r\nknow all about them? Only in the north country, where I have been, they\r\nknow nothing of war by water and these two men do. I want their help\r\nfor the present. When my end is achieved I can do as I like with them.”\r\n\r\nLiu Tsʻung was highly delighted when his two chief supporters returned\r\nwith the promise Tsʻao had given them. Soon after he gave up his seal\r\nand military commission and proceeded to welcome Tsʻao Tsʻao, who\r\nreceived him very graciously.\r\n\r\nTsʻao next proceeded to camp near Hsiangyang. The populace, led by\r\nTsʻai Mao, welcomed him with burning incense, and he on his part put\r\nforth proclamations couched in comforting terms.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao presently entered the city and took his seat in the\r\nresidence in state. Then he summoned Kʻuai Yüeh and said to him\r\ngraciously, “I do not rejoice so much at gaining Chingchou as at\r\nmeeting you, I-tu.”\r\n\r\nHe made Kʻuai Prefect of Chiangling and Marquis of Fanchʻêng; his other\r\nadherents were all ennobled. Liu Tsʻung became Governor of Chʻingchou\r\nin the north and was ordered to proceed to his district forthwith. He\r\nwas greatly frightened and said he had no wish to become an actual\r\nofficial; he wished to remain in the place where his father and mother\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao, “Your governorship is quite near the capital and I have\r\nsent you there as a full official to remove you from the intrigues of\r\nthis place.”\r\n\r\nIn vain Liu Tsʻung declined the honours thus thrust upon him; he was\r\ncompelled to go and he departed, taking his mother with him. Of his\r\nfriends, only Wang Wei accompanied him. Some of his late officers\r\nescorted him as far as the river and then took their leave. Then Tsʻao\r\ncalled his trusty officer Yü Chin and bade him follow up Liu Tsʻung and\r\nput him and his mother to death.\r\n\r\nYü Chin followed the small party. When he drew near he shouted, “I have\r\nan order from the great Minister to put you both to death, mother and\r\nson; you may as well submit quietly.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Tsʻai threw her arms about her son, lifted up her voice and\r\nwept. Yü Chin bade the soldiers get on with their bloody work. Only\r\nWang Wei made any attempt to save his mistress and he was soon killed.\r\nThe two, mother and son, were soon finished and the murderer returned\r\nto report his success. He was richly rewarded.\r\n\r\nNext Tsʻao Tsʻao sent to discover and seize the family of Kʻung-ming,\r\nbut they had already disappeared. It was much to Tsʻao’s disgust that\r\nthe search was fruitless.\r\n\r\nSo Hsiangyang was settled. Then Hsün Yu proposed a further advance. He\r\nsaid, “Chiangling is an important place, and very rich; if Liu Pei gets\r\nit, it will be difficult to dislodge him.”\r\n\r\n“How could I have overlooked that?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen he called upon the officers of Hsiangyang for one who could lead\r\nthe way. They all came except Wên Pʻing.\r\n\r\nTsʻao sent for him and soon he came also. “Why are you late?” asked\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\n“To be a minister and see one’s master lose his own boundaries is most\r\nshameful. Such an one has no face to show to any man and I was too\r\nashamed to come.”\r\n\r\nHis tears fell fast as he finished this speech. Tsʻao admired his loyal\r\nconduct and rewarded him with office and a title, and also bade him\r\nopen the way.\r\n\r\nThe spies returned and told how Liu Pei was hampered by the crowds of\r\npeople who had followed him. And he was then only three hundred li\r\naway. Tsʻao decided to take advantage of his plight so chose out five\r\ncompanies of tried horsemen and sent them after the cavalcade, giving\r\nthem a limit of a day and a night to come up therewith. The main army\r\nwould follow.\r\n\r\nAs has been said Liu Pei was travelling with a huge multitude of\r\nfollowers, to guard whom he had taken what precautions were possible.\r\nKuan Yü had been sent to Chianghsia. One day Kʻung-ming came in and\r\nsaid, “There is as yet no news from Chianghsia; what are we to do?”\r\n\r\n“I wish that you yourself would go there,” said Liu Pei. “Liu Chi would\r\nremember your former kindness to him and consent to anything you\r\nproposed.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming said he would go and set out with Liu Fêng, the adopted son\r\nof Liu Pei, taking an escort of half a company.\r\n\r\nA few days after, while on the march in company with three of his\r\nintimate captains, a sudden whirlwind rose just in front of Yüan-tê,\r\nand a huge column of dust shot up into the air hiding the face of the\r\nsun. Yüan-tê was frightened and asked what that might portend. Chien\r\nYung, who knew something of the mysteries of nature, took the auspices\r\nby counting secretly on his fingers. Pale and trembling he announced\r\nthat a calamity was threatening that very night. He advised his lord to\r\nleave the people to their fate and flee quickly. But he refused to\r\nthink of it.\r\n\r\n“If you allow your pity to overcome your judgment, then misfortune is\r\nvery near,” said Chien.\r\n\r\nThus spake Chien Yung to his lord, who then asked what place was near.\r\nHis people replied that Tangyang was quite close and there was a very\r\nfamous hill near it called Chingshan or Prospect Hill. Then Yüan-tê\r\nbade them lead the way thither.\r\n\r\nThe season was late autumn, just changing to winter, and the icy wind\r\npenetrated to the very bones. As evening fell, long-drawn howls of\r\nmisery were heard on every side. At the middle of the fourth watch, two\r\nhours after midnight, they heard a rumbling sound in the north-west.\r\nYüan-tê halted and placed himself at the head of his own guard of two\r\ncompanies to meet whatever might come. Presently Tsʻao’s men appeared\r\nand made a fierce onslaught. Defence was impossible, though Yüan-tê\r\nfought desperately. By good fortune just at the crisis Chang Fei came\r\nup, cut his way through, rescued his brother and got him away to the\r\neast. Presently they were stopped by Wên Pʻing.\r\n\r\n“Turncoat! Can you still look men in the face?” cried Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nWên Pʻing was overwhelmed with shame and led his men away. Chang Fei,\r\nnow fighting, now flying, protected his brother till dawn.\r\n\r\nBy that time Liu Pei had got beyond the sound of battle and there was\r\ntime to rest. Only a few of his men had been able to keep near him. He\r\nknew nothing of the fate of his captains or the people. He lifted up\r\nhis voice in lamentation saying, “Myriads of living souls are suffering\r\nfrom love of me, and my captains and my loved ones are lost. One would\r\nbe a graven image not to weep at such loss.”\r\n\r\nStill plunged in sadness presently he saw hurrying toward him Mi Fang,\r\nwith an enemy’s arrow still sticking in his face. He exclaimed, “Chao\r\nYün has gone over to Tsʻao Tsʻao!”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê angrily bade him be silent. “Do you think I can believe that of\r\nmy old friend?” cried he.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he has gone over,” said Chang Fei. “He must see that we are\r\nnearly lost and there are riches and honours on the other side.”\r\n\r\n“He has followed me faithfully through all my misfortunes. His heart is\r\nfirm as a rock. No riches or honours would move him.”\r\n\r\n“I saw him go away north-west,” said Mi Fang.\r\n\r\n“Wait till I meet him,” said Chang Fei. “If I run against him I will\r\nkill him.”\r\n\r\n“Beware how you doubt him,” said Yüan-tê. “Have you forgotten the\r\ncircumstances under which your brother had to slay two men to ease your\r\ndoubts of him? Chao Yün’s absence is due to good reason wherever he has\r\ngone, and he would never abandon me.”\r\n\r\nBut do you think Chang Fei was convinced? Then Chang Fei, with a score\r\nof his men, rode to Chʻangpan Bridge. Seeing a wood near the bridge, an\r\nidea suddenly struck him. He bade his followers cut branches from the\r\ntrees, tie them to the tails of the horses and ride to and fro so as to\r\nraise a great dust as though an army were concealed in the wood. He\r\nhimself took up his station on the bridge facing the west with spear\r\nset ready for action. So he kept watch.\r\n\r\nNow Chao Yün, after fighting with the enemy from the fourth watch till\r\ndaylight, could see no sign of his lord and, moreover, had lost his\r\nlord’s family. He thought bitterly within himself, “My master confided\r\nto me his family and the young lord; and I have lost them. How can I\r\nlook him in the face? I can only go now and fight to the death.\r\nWhatever happen I must go to seek the women and my lord’s son.”\r\n\r\nTurning about he found he had but two score followers left. He rode\r\nquickly to and fro among the scattered soldiers seeking the lost women.\r\nThe lamentations of the people about him were enough to make heaven and\r\nearth weep. Some had been wounded by arrows, others by spears; they had\r\nthrown away their children, abandoned their wives, and were flying they\r\nknew not whither in crowds.\r\n\r\nPresently he saw a man lying in the grass and recognised him as Chien\r\nYung.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the two mothers?” cried he.\r\n\r\nChien replied, “They left their carriage and ran away taking O-tou in\r\ntheir arms. I followed but on the slope of the hill I was wounded and\r\nfell from my horse. The horse was stolen. I could fight no longer and I\r\nlay down here.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün put his colleague on the horse of one of his followers, told\r\noff two soldiers to support him and bade him ride to their lord and\r\ntell him of the loss. “Say,” said he, “that I will seek the lost ones\r\nin heaven or hell, through good or evil, and if I find them not I will\r\ndie in the desert.”\r\n\r\nThen he rode off toward Chʻangpan Slope. As he went a voice called out,\r\n“General Chao, where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” said Chao Yün, pulling up.\r\n\r\n“One of the Princely One’s carriage guards. I am wounded.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything of the two ladies?”\r\n\r\n“Not very long ago I saw the Lady Kan go south with a party of other\r\nwomen. Her hair was down and she was barefooted.”\r\n\r\nHearing this, without even another glance at the speaker, Chao Yün put\r\nhis horse at full gallop toward the south. Soon he saw a small crowd of\r\npersons, male and female, walking hand in hand.\r\n\r\n“Is the Lady Kan among you?” he called out.\r\n\r\nA woman in the rear of the party looked up at him and uttered a loud\r\ncry. He slipped off his steed, stuck his spear in the sand and wept,\r\n“It was my fault that you were lost. But where are the Lady Mi and our\r\nyoung lord?”\r\n\r\nShe replied, “I and she were forced to abandon our carriage and mingle\r\nwith the crowd on foot. Then a band of soldiers came up and we were\r\nseparated. I do not know where they are. I ran for my life.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke a howl of distress rose from the crowd of fugitives, for a\r\ncompany of soldiers appeared. Chao Yün recovered his spear and mounted\r\nready for action. Presently he saw among the soldiers a prisoner bound\r\nupon a horse; and the prisoner was Mi Chu. Behind him followed a\r\ncaptain gripping a huge sword. The men belonged to the army of Tsʻao\r\nJên and the Captain was Shunyu Tao. Having captured Mi Chu he was just\r\ntaking him to his chief as a proof of his prowess.\r\n\r\nChao Yün shouted and rode at the captor who was speedily unhorsed and\r\nhis captive was set free. Then taking two of the horses Chao Yün set\r\nthe lady on one and Mi Chu took the other. They rode away toward\r\nChʻangpan Slope.\r\n\r\nBut there, standing grim on the bridge, was Chang Fei. As soon as he\r\nsaw Chao Yün he called out, “Tzŭ-lung, why have you betrayed my\r\nbrother?”\r\n\r\n“I fell behind because I was seeking the ladies and our young lord,”\r\nsaid Chao Yün. “What do you mean by talking of betrayal?”\r\n\r\n“If it had not been that Chien Yung arrived before you I should hardly\r\nhave spared you.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the master?” said Chao Yün.\r\n\r\n“Not far away, in front there.”\r\n\r\n“Conduct the Lady Kan to him; I am going to look for the Lady Mi,” said\r\nChao Yün to his companion, and he turned back along the road by which\r\nhe had come.\r\n\r\nBefore long he met a captain armed with an iron spear and carrying a\r\nsword slung across his back, riding a curvetting steed and leading a\r\nhalf score of other horsemen. Without uttering a word Chao Yün rode\r\nstraight toward him and engaged. At the first pass he disarmed his\r\nopponent and brought him to earth. His followers galloped away.\r\n\r\nThis fallen officer was no other that Hsiahou En. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nsword-bearer, and the sword on his back was his master’s. Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nhad two swords, one called I-tʻien (Trust in God) and the other\r\nChʻing-kung. I-tʻien was the weapon he usually wore at his side, the\r\nother being carried by his sword-bearer. Chʻing-kung would cut clean\r\nthrough iron as though it were mud and no sword had so keen an edge.\r\n\r\nWhen Chao Yün thus fell in with Tsʻao’s sword-bearer the later was\r\nsimply plundering, depending upon the authority implied by his office.\r\nLeast of all thought he of such sudden death as met him at Chao Yün’s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nSo Chao Yün got possession of a famous sword. The name Chʻing-kung was\r\nchased in gold characters so that he recognised its value at once. He\r\nstuck it in his belt and again plunged into the press. Just as he did\r\nso he turned his head and saw he had not a single follower left; he was\r\nquite alone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless not for a single instant thought he of turning back; he\r\nwas too intent upon his quest. To and fro, back and forth, he rode\r\nquestioning this person and that. At length a man said, “A woman with a\r\nchild in her arms, and wounded in the thigh so that she cannot walk, is\r\nlying over there through that hole in the wall.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün rode to look and there, beside an old well behind the broken\r\nwall of a burned house, sat the mother clasping the child to her breast\r\nand weeping.\r\n\r\nChao was on his knees before her in a moment.\r\n\r\n“My child will live then since you are here,” cried the Lady Mi. “Pity\r\nhim, O General; protect him, for he is the only son of his father’s\r\nflesh and blood. Take him to his father and I can die content.”\r\n\r\n“It is my fault that you have suffered,” replied Chao Yün. “But it is\r\nuseless to say more. I pray you take my horse while I will walk beside\r\nand protect you till we get clear.”\r\n\r\nShe replied, “I may not do that. What would you do without a steed? But\r\nthe boy here I confide to your care. I am badly wounded and cannot hope\r\nto live. Pray take him and go your way. Do not trouble more about me.”\r\n\r\n“I hear shouting,” said Chao. “The soldiers will be upon us again in a\r\nmoment. Pray mount quickly.”\r\n\r\n“But really I cannot move,” she said. “Do not let there be a double\r\nloss!” And she held out the child toward him as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“Take the child,” cried she. “His life and safety are in your hands.”\r\n\r\nAgain and again Chao Yün besought her to get on his horse, but she\r\nwould not. The shouting drew nearer and nearer, Chao Yün spoke harshly\r\nsaying, “If you will not do what I say, what will happen when the\r\nsoldiers come up?”\r\n\r\nShe said no more. Throwing the child on the ground she turned over and\r\nthrew herself into the old well. And there she perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The warrior relies upon the strength of his charger,\r\n    Afoot, how could he bear to safety his young prince?\r\n    Brave mother! who died to preserve the son of her husband’s line;\r\n    Heroine was she, bold and decisive!\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing that the lady had resolved the question by dying there was\r\nnothing more to be done. Chao Yün filled in the well with the rubbish\r\nthat lay about lest the dead body should suffer shame. Then he loosened\r\nhis armour, let down the heart-protecting mirror and placed the child\r\nin his breast. This done he slung his spear and re-mounted.\r\n\r\nHe had gone but a short distance when he saw Yen Ming, one of Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao’s minor captains. This warrior used a double edged, three pointed\r\nweapon and he offered battle. However, Chao Yün disposed of him after a\r\nvery few bouts and dispersed his men.\r\n\r\nAs the road cleared before him he saw another detachment barring his\r\nway. At the head of this was a captain of rank exalted enough to\r\ndisplay a banner with his name Chang Ho. Chao Yün never waited to\r\nparley but attacked. However, this was a more formidable antagonist and\r\nhalf a score bouts found neither any nearer defeat. But Chao, with the\r\nchild in his bosom, could only fight with the greatest caution and so\r\nhe decided to flee. Chang Ho pursued and as Chao thought only of\r\nthrashing his steed to get away, and little of the road, suddenly he\r\nwent crashing into a pit. On came his pursuer, spear at poise. Suddenly\r\na brilliant flash of light seemed to shoot out of the pit and the\r\nfallen horse leapt with it into the air and was again on firm earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A bright glory surrounds the child of the imperial line, now in\r\n                                                                danger,\r\n    The powerful charger forces his way through the press of battle,\r\n    Bearing to safety him who was destined to sit on the throne two\r\n                                                   score years and two;\r\n    And the general thus manifested his godlike courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis apparition frightened Chang Ho, who abandoned the pursuit\r\nforthwith and Chao Yün rode off. Presently he heard shouts behind,\r\n“Chao Yün, Chao Yün, stop!” and at the same time he saw ahead of him\r\ntwo captains who seemed disposed to dispute his way. Two in front and\r\ntwo following, his state seemed desperate, but he quailed not.\r\n\r\nAs the men of Tsʻao came pressing on he drew Tsʻao Tsʻao’s own sword to\r\nbeat them off. Nothing could resist it. Armour, clothing, it went\r\nthrough without effort and blood gushed forth in fountains wherever it\r\nstruck. So the four captains were soon beaten off and Chao Yün was once\r\nagain free.\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao Tsʻao from a hill top saw these deeds of derring-do and a\r\ncaptain showing such valour that none could withstand him, so he asked\r\nof his followers whether any knew the man. No one recognised him, so\r\nTsʻao Hung galloped down into the plain and shouted to the hero asking\r\nhim his name.\r\n\r\n“I am Chao Tzŭ-lung of Chʻangshan,” replied Chao Yün.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Hung returned and told his lord, who said, “A very tiger of a\r\nleader! I must get him alive.” Whereupon he sent gallopers to all\r\ndetachments with orders that no arrows were to be fired from an ambush\r\nat any point Chao Yün should pass; he was to be taken alive.\r\n\r\nAnd so Chao Yün escaped most imminent danger, and O-tou’s safety, bound\r\nup with his saviour’s, was also secured. On this career of slaughter\r\nwhich ended in safety, Chao Yün, bearing in his bosom him who was to be\r\nknown as The Later Lord, cut down two banners, took three spears and\r\nslew of Tsʻao’s captains half a hundred, all men of renown.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Blood dyed the fighting robe and crimsoned his buff coat;\r\n    None dared engage the terrible warrior at Tangyang;\r\n    In the days of old lived the brave Chao Yün,\r\n    Who fought in the battlefield for his lord in danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus fought his way out of the press Chao Yün lost no time in\r\ngetting away from the battle field. His battle robe was soaked in\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nOn his way, near the rise of the hills, he met with two other bodies of\r\nmen under two brothers, Chung Chin and Chung Shên. One of these was\r\narmed with a massive axe, the other a halberd. As soon as they saw Chao\r\nYün they knew him and shouted, “Quickly dismount and be bound!”\r\n\r\n\r\n        He has only escaped from the tiger’s cave,\r\n        To risk the deep pool’s sounding wave.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Chao Yün escaped will be next related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nCHANG FEI’S GREAT FIGHT AT CHʻANGPAN SLOPE:\r\nLIU PEI, DEFEATED, GOES TO HANCHINGKʻOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs related in the last chapter two brothers appeared in front of our\r\nwarrior, who rode at them with his spear ready for a thrust. Chung Chin\r\nwas leading, flourishing his battle-axe. Chao Yün engaged and very soon\r\nunhorsed him. Then he galloped away. Chung Shên rode up behind ready\r\nwith his halberd and his horse’s nose got so close to the other’s tail\r\nthat in Chao Yün’s back heart-protecting mirror he could see the play\r\nof the reflection of his weapon. Then suddenly, and without warning,\r\nChao Yün wheeled round his horse so that he faced his pursuer and their\r\ntwo steeds struck breast to breast. With his spear in his left hand he\r\nwarded off the halberd strokes and in his right he swung the sword\r\nChʻing-kung. One slash and he had cut through both helmet and head;\r\nChung Shên fell to the ground, a corpse with only half a head on his\r\nbody. His followers fled and Chao Yün retook the road toward Long Slope\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nBut in his rear arose another tumultuous shouting, seeming to rend the\r\nvery sky, and Wên Pʻing came up behind. However, although the man was\r\nweary and his steed highspent, Chao Yün got close to the bridge where\r\nhe saw standing, all ready for any fray, his brother in arms.\r\n\r\n“Help me, I-tê!” he cried and crossed the bridge.\r\n\r\n“Hasten!” cried Chang Fei, “I will keep back the pursuers.”\r\n\r\nAbout twenty li from the bridge he saw Yüan-tê with his followers\r\nreposing in the shade of some trees. He dismounted and drew near,\r\nweeping. The tears also started to Yüan-tê’s eyes when he saw his\r\nfaithful follower.\r\n\r\nStill panting from his exertions, Chao Yün gasped out, “My fault——death\r\nis too light a punishment. The Lady Mi was severely wounded; she\r\nrefused my horse and threw herself into a well. She is dead and all I\r\ncould do was to fill in the well with the rubbish that lay around. But\r\nI placed the babe in the breast of my fighting robe and have won my way\r\nout of the press of battle. Thanks to the little lord’s grand luck I\r\nhave escaped. At first he cried a good deal, but for some time now he\r\nhas not stirred or made a sound. I fear I may not have saved his life\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\nThen he opened his robe and looked; the child was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n“Happily, Sir, your son is unhurt,” said Chao as he drew him forth and\r\npresented him in both hands. Yüan-tê took the child but threw it aside\r\nangrily, saying, “To preserve that suckling I very nearly lost a great\r\ncaptain.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün picked up the child again and, weeping, said, “Were I ground\r\nto powder I could not prove my gratitude.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        From out Tsʻao’s host a tiger rushed,\r\n          His wish but to destroy;\r\n        Though Liu Pei’s consort lost her life,\r\n          Chao Yün preserved her boy.\r\n        “Too great the risk you ran to save\r\n          This child,” the father cried.\r\n        To show he rated Chao Yün high,\r\n          He threw his son aside.\r\n\r\n\r\nWên Pʻing and his company pursued Chao Yün till they saw Chang Fei’s\r\nbristling moustache and fiercely glaring eyes before them. There he was\r\nseated on his battle steed, his hand grasping his terrible serpent-like\r\nspear, guarding the bridge. They also saw great clouds of dust rising\r\nabove the trees and concluded they would fall into an ambush if they\r\nventured across the bridge. So they stopped the pursuit, not daring to\r\nadvance further.\r\n\r\nIn a little time several other captains came up, but none dared\r\nadvance, frightened not only by Chang Fei’s fierce look, but lest they\r\nshould become victims of a ruse of the terrible Chuko Liang. As they\r\ncame up they formed a line on the west side, halting till they could\r\ninform their lord of the position.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the messengers arrived and Tsʻao Tsʻao heard about it he\r\nmounted and rode to the bridge to see for himself. Chang Fei’s fierce\r\neye scanning the hinder position of the army opposite him saw the\r\nsilken umbrella, the axes and banners coming along and concluded that\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao came to see for himself how matters stood. So in a mighty\r\nvoice he shouted, “I am Chang I-tê of Yen; who dares fight with me?”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of this thundrous voice a terrible quaking fear seized\r\nupon Tsʻao and he bade them take the umbrella away. Turning to his\r\nfollowers he said, “Kuan Yü said that his brother Chang Fei was the\r\nsort of man to go through an army of a hundred legions and take the\r\nhead of its commander-in-chief; and do it easily. Now here is this\r\nterror in front of us and we must be careful.”\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking again that terrible voice was heard, “I am\r\nChang I-tê of Yen; who dares fight with me?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao, seeing his enemy so fierce and resolute, was too frightened to\r\nthink of anything but retreat and Chang Fei, seeing a movement going on\r\nin the rear, once again shook his spear and roared, “What mean you,\r\ncowards? You will not fight nor do you run away.”\r\n\r\nThis roar had scarcely begun when one of Tsʻao’s staff reeled and fell\r\nfrom his horse terror-stricken, paralysed with fear. The panic touched\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao, and spread to his whole surroundings and he and his staff\r\ngalloped for their lives. They were as frightened as a suckling babe at\r\na clap of thunder or a weak woodcutter at the roar of a tiger. Many\r\nthrew away their spears, dropped their casques and fled, a wave of\r\npanic-stricken humanity, a tumbling mass of terrified horses. None\r\nthought of aught but flight, and those who ran trampled the bodies of\r\nfallen comrades under foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Chang Fei was wrathful; and who dared\r\n        To accept his challenge? Fierce he glared;\r\n        His thundrous voice rolled out, and then\r\n        In terror fled Tsʻao’s armed men.\r\n\r\n\r\nPanic stricken Tsʻao Tsʻao galloped westward with the rest, thinking of\r\nnothing but getting away. He lost his headdress and his loosened hair\r\nstreamed behind him. Presently Chang Liao and Hsü Chʻu came up with him\r\nand seized his bridle; fear had deprived him of all self-control.\r\n\r\n“Do not be frightened,” said Chang Liao. “After all Chang Fei is but\r\none man and not worthy of extravagant fear. If you will only return and\r\nattack you will capture your enemy.”\r\n\r\nBy that time Tsʻao had somewhat overcome his panic and become\r\nreasonable. Two captains were ordered back to the bridge to\r\nreconnoitre.\r\n\r\nChang Fei saw the disorderly rout of the enemy but he dared not pursue.\r\nHowever, he bade his score or so of dust-raising followers to cut loose\r\nthe branches from their horses’ tails and come to help destroy the\r\nbridge. This done he went to report to his brother and told him of the\r\ndestruction of the bridge.\r\n\r\n“Brave as you are, brother, and no one is braver, you are no\r\nstrategist,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“What mean you, brother?”\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao is very deep. You are no match for him. The destruction of\r\nthe bridge will bring him in pursuit.”\r\n\r\n“If he ran away at a yell of mine, think you he will dare return?”\r\n\r\n“If you had left the bridge he would have thought there was an ambush\r\nand would not have dared to pass it. Now the destruction of the bridge\r\ntells him we are weak and fearful, and he will pursue. He does not mind\r\na broken bridge. His legions could fill up the biggest rivers that we\r\ncould get across.”\r\n\r\nSo orders were given to march and they went by a bye-road which led\r\ndiagonally to Hanching and then took the road to Minyang.\r\n\r\nThe two captains sent by Tsʻao to reconnoitre near Chʻang-pan Bridge\r\nreturned, saying, “The bridge has been destroyed, Chang Fei has left.”\r\n\r\n“Then he is afraid,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHe at once gave orders to set a legion at work on three floating\r\nbridges to be finished that night.\r\n\r\nLi Tien said, “I fear this is one of the wiles of Chuko Liang; so be\r\ncareful.”\r\n\r\n“Chang Fei is just a bold warrior, but there is no guile about him,”\r\nsaid Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nHe gave orders for immediate advance.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei was making all speed to Hanching. Suddenly there appeared in\r\nhis track a great cloud of dust whence came loud rolls of drums and\r\nshoutings. Yüan-tê was dismayed and said, “Before us rolls the great\r\nriver; behind is the pursuer. What hope is there for us?”\r\n\r\nBut he bade Chao Yün organise a defence.\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao Tsʻao in an order to his army had said, “Liu Pei is a fish in\r\nthe fish kettle; a tiger in the pit. Catch him this time, or the fish\r\nwill get back to the sea and the tiger escape to the hills. Therefore\r\nevery captain must use his best efforts to press on.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence every leader bade those under him hasten forward. And\r\nthey were pressing on at great speed when suddenly soldiers appeared\r\nfrom the hills and a voice cried, “I have waited here a long time.”\r\n\r\nThe leader who had shouted this bore in his hand the Black Dragon sword\r\nand rode “Red Hare,” for indeed it was no other than Kuan Yü. He had\r\ngone to Chianghsia for help and had returned with a whole legion.\r\nHaving heard of the battle he had taken this very road to intercept\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Kuan Yü appeared Tsʻao stopped and said to his officers,\r\n“Here we are, tricked again by that Chuko Liang.”\r\n\r\nWithout more ado he ordered a retreat. Kuan Yü followed him some ten li\r\nand then drew off to act as guard to his elder brother on his way to\r\nthe river. There boats were ready and Yüan-tê and family went on board.\r\nWhen all were settled comfortably in the boat Kuan Yü asked where was\r\nhis sister, the second wife of his brother. Then Yüan-tê told him the\r\nstory of Tangyang.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Kuan Yü. “Had you taken my advice that day of the hunting\r\nin Hsütʻien we should have escaped the misery of this day.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Yüan-tê, “on that day it was ‘Ware damage when pelting\r\nrats.’”\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke he heard war-drums on the south bank. A fleet of\r\nboats, thick as a flight of ants, came running up with swelling sails\r\nbefore the fair wind. He was alarmed.\r\n\r\nThe boats came nearer. There he saw the white clad figure of a man\r\nwearing a silver helmet who stood in the prow of the foremost ship. He\r\ncried, “Are you all right, my uncle? I am very guilty.”\r\n\r\nIt was Liu Chi. He bowed low as the ship passed, saying, “I heard you\r\nwere in danger from Tsʻao Tsʻao and I have come to aid you.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê welcomed him with joy and his soldiers joined in with the main\r\nbody and the whole fleet sailed on, while they told each other their\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly in the south-west there appeared a line of fighting ships\r\nswishing up before a fair wind. Liu Chi said, “All my men are here and\r\nnow there is an enemy barring the way. If they are not Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nships they must be from Chiangtung. We have a poor chance. What now?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê went to the prow and gazed at them. Presently he made out a\r\nfigure in a turban and Taoist robe sitting in the bows of one of the\r\nboats and knew it to be Kʻung-ming. Behind him stood Sun Chʻien.\r\n\r\nWhen they were quite near Yüan-tê asked Kʻung-ming how he came to be\r\nthere. And he reported what he had done, saying, “When I reached\r\nChianghsia I sent Kuan Yü to land at Hanching with reinforcements, for\r\nI feared pursuit from Tsʻao Tsʻao and knew the road you would take. So\r\nI prayed your nephew to go to meet you while I went to Hsiakʻou to\r\nmuster as many men as possible.”\r\n\r\nThe new-comers added to their strength and they began once more to\r\nconsider how their powerful enemy might be overcome.\r\n\r\nSaid Kʻung-ming, “Hsiakʻou is strong and a good strategical point; it\r\nis also rich and suited for a lengthy stay. I would ask you, my lord,\r\nto make it a permanent camp. Your nephew can go to Chianghsia to get\r\nthe fleet in order and prepare weapons. Thus there will be two\r\nthreatening angles to our position. If we all return to Chianghsia the\r\nposition will be weakened.”\r\n\r\nLiu Chi replied, “The Adviser-General’s words are excellent, but I\r\nwould rather my uncle stayed awhile in Chianghsia till the army was in\r\nthorough order. Then he could go to Hsiakʻou.\r\n\r\n“You speak to the point, nephew,” replied Yüan-tê. Then leaving Kuan Yü\r\nwith half a legion at Hsiakʻou he, with Kʻung-ming and his nephew, went\r\nto Chianghsia.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao saw Kuan Yü with a force ready to attack he feared\r\nlest a greater number were hidden away behind, so he stopped the\r\npursuit. He also feared lest Yüan-tê should take Chiangling, so he\r\nmarched thither with all haste.\r\n\r\nThe two officers in command at Chingchou had heard of what happened at\r\nHsiangyang and, knowing that there was no chance of successful defence\r\nagainst Tsʻao Tsʻao’s armies, they led out the people of Chingchou to\r\nthe outskirts and offered submission. Tsʻao entered the city and, after\r\nrestoring order and confidence, he released Han Sung and gave him the\r\ndignified office of Director of Ambassadorial Receptions. He rewarded\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nThen said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “Liu Pei has gone to Chianghsia and may ally\r\nhimself with Wu and the opposition to me will be greater. Can he be\r\ndestroyed?”\r\n\r\nHsün Yu said, “The splendour of your achievements has spread wide.\r\nTherefore you might send a messenger to invite Sun Chʻüan to a grand\r\nhunting party at Chianghsia and you two could seize Liu Pei, share\r\nChingchou with Sun and make a solemn treaty. Sun will be too frightened\r\nnot to come over to you and your end will be gained.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao agreed. He sent the letters by a messenger and he prepared his\r\nmen, horse and foot and marines. He had in all eighty-three legions,\r\nbut he called them a hundred. The attack was to be by land and water at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nThe fleet advanced up the river in two lines. On the west it extended\r\nto Chianghsia, on the east to Chʻihuang in Hupeh. The stockades\r\nstretched three hundred li.\r\n\r\nAt this point the narrative must digress. The story of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nmovements and successes reached Sun Chʻüan, then in camp at Chʻaisang.\r\nHe assembled his strategists to decide on a scheme of defence.\r\n\r\nLu Su said, “Chingchou is contiguous to our borders. It is strong and\r\ndefensive, its people are rich. It is the sort of country that an\r\nemperor or a king should have. Liu Piao’s recent death gives an excuse\r\nfor me to be sent to convey condolence and, once there, I shall be able\r\nto talk over Liu Pei and the officers of the late prefect to combine\r\nwith you against Tsʻao. If Liu Pei does as I wish, then success is\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan thought this a good plan, so he had the necessary letters\r\nprepared, and the gifts, and sent Lu Su with them.\r\n\r\nAll this time Liu Pei was at Chianghsia where, with Kʻung-ming and Liu\r\nChʻi, he was endeavouring to evolve a good plan of campaign.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming said, “Tsʻao Tsʻao’s power is too great for us to cope with.\r\nLet us go over to Wu and ask help from Sun Chʻüan. If we can set north\r\nand south at grips we ought to be able to get some advantage from our\r\nmediary position between them.”\r\n\r\n“But will they be willing to have anything to do with us?” said\r\nYüan-tê. “It is a large and populous country and Sun Chʻüan has\r\nambitions of his own.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “Tsʻao with his army of a hundred legions holds the\r\nHan and the Yangtse. Chiangtung will certainly send to find out all\r\npossible about the position. Should any messenger come I shall borrow a\r\nlittle boat and make a little trip over the river and trust to my\r\nlittle lithe tongue to set north and south at each other’s throats. If\r\nthe southern men win, we will assist in destroying Tsʻao in order to\r\nget Chingchou; if the north win, we shall profit by the victory to get\r\nChiangnan. So we shall get some advantage either way.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very fine view to take,” said Yüan-tê. “But how are you\r\ngoing to get hold of any one from the south to talk to?”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei’s question was answered by the arrival of Lu Su, and as the\r\nship touched the bank and the envoy came ashore, Kʻung-ming laughed,\r\nsaying, “It is done!”\r\n\r\nTurning to Liu Chʻi he asked, “When Sun Tsʻê died did your country send\r\nany condolences?”\r\n\r\n“Is it likely there would be any mourning courtesies between them and\r\nus while there was the death of a father to avenge?”\r\n\r\n“Then it is certain that this envoy does not come to present\r\ncondolences but to spy out the land.”\r\n\r\nSo he said to Yüan-tê, “When Lu Su asks about the movements of Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, you will know nothing. If he press the matter, say he can ask\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepared their scheme they sent to welcome the envoy, who\r\nentered the city in mourning garb. The gifts having been accepted, Liu\r\nChʻi asked Lu Su to meet Yüan-tê. When the introductory ceremonies were\r\nover the three men went to one of the inner chambers to drink a cup of\r\nwine. Presently Lu Su said to Yüan-tê, “By reputation I have known you\r\na long time, Uncle Liu, but till to-day I have not met you. I am very\r\ngratified at seeing you. You have been fighting Tsʻao Tsʻao, though,\r\nlately, so I suppose you know all about him. Has he really so great an\r\narmy? How many, do you think, he has?”\r\n\r\n“My army was so small that we fled whenever we heard of his approach;\r\nso I do not know how many he had.”\r\n\r\n“You had the advice of Chuko Kʻung-ming and you used fire on Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao twice. You burned him almost to death so that you can hardly say\r\nyou know nothing about his men,” said Lu.\r\n\r\n“Without asking my adviser I really do not know the details.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Kʻung-ming? I should like to see him,” said Lu.\r\n\r\nSo they sent for him and he was introduced. When the ceremonies were\r\nover Lu Su said, “I have long admired your genius but have never been\r\nfortunate enough to meet you. Now that I have met you I hope I may\r\nspeak of present politics.”\r\n\r\nReplied Kʻung-ming, “We know all Tsʻao Tsʻao’s infamies and\r\nwickednesses, but to our regret we were not strong enough to withstand\r\nhim. That is why we avoided him.”\r\n\r\n“Is the Imperial Uncle going to stay here?”\r\n\r\n“The Princely One is an old friend of Wu Chʻên, Prefect of Tsʻangwu and\r\nintends to go to him.”\r\n\r\n“He has few men and insufficient supplies, he cannot ensure safety. How\r\ncan he receive the Uncle?” said Lu.\r\n\r\n“His place is not one to remain in long, but it is good enough for the\r\npresent. We can make other plans for the future.”\r\n\r\nLu said, “Sun Chʻüan is strongly posted and is exceedingly well\r\nsupplied. He treats able men and scholars with the greatest courtesy\r\nand so they gather round him. Now if you are seeking a plan for your\r\nPrince you cannot do better than send some friend to confer with him.”\r\n\r\n“There have never been any relations between my master and yours,” said\r\nKʻung-ming. “I fear there would be nothing but a waste of words.\r\nBesides, we have no one to send.”\r\n\r\n“Your elder brother is there as adviser and is longing to see you. I am\r\nbut a simple wight but I should be pleased to discuss affairs with my\r\nmaster and you.”\r\n\r\n“But he is my Director-in-Chief,” said Yüan-tê, “and I cannot do\r\nwithout him. He cannot go.”\r\n\r\nLu Su pressed him. Yüan-tê pretended to refuse permission.\r\n\r\n“It is important; I pray you give me leave to go,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê consented. And they soon took leave and the two set out by\r\nboat for Sun Chʻüan’s headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A little boat sailed down the stream\r\n            With Chuko well content;\r\n        For he could see his enemies\r\n            To black perdition sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of this journey will appear in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nCHUKO LIANG DISPUTES WITH THE SCHOLARS:\r\nLU SU DENOUNCES THE MAJORITY OPINION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the boat on the way to Chʻaisang the two travellers beguiled the\r\ntime by discussing affairs. Lu Su impressed upon his companion the\r\nnecessity of concealing from Sun Chʻüan the truth about the magnitude\r\nof Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army.\r\n\r\n“I do not promise to do what you ask,” replied Chuko Liang, “but I\r\nshall know how to reply.”\r\n\r\nWhen the boat arrived Kʻung-ming was lodged in the guests’ quarters and\r\nLu Su went alone to see his master. He found him actually at a council,\r\nassembled to consider the situation. Lu Su was summoned thereto and\r\nquestioned at once upon what he had discovered.\r\n\r\n“I know the general outline, but I want a little time to prepare my\r\nreport,” replied he.\r\n\r\nThen Sun Chʻüan produced Tsʻao Tsʻao’s letter and gave it to Su. “That\r\ncame yesterday. I have sent the bearer of it back and this gathering is\r\nto consider the reply,” said he.\r\n\r\nLu Su read the letter, which said, “When I, the solitary one, received\r\nthe imperial command to punish a fault my banners went south and Liu\r\nTsʻung became my prisoner, while his people flocked to my side at the\r\nfirst rumour of my coming. Under my hand are a hundred legions and I\r\nhave many able captains. My desire is, General, that we go on a great\r\nhunting expedition into Chianghsia and together attack Liu Pei. We will\r\nshare his land between us and we will swear perpetual amity. If happily\r\nyou would not be a mere looker-on I pray you reply quickly.”\r\n\r\n“What have you decided upon, my lord?” asked Lu as he finished the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“I have not yet decided.”\r\n\r\nThen Chang Chao said, “It would be imprudent to withstand Tsʻao’s many\r\nlegions backed by the imperial authority. Moreover your most important\r\ndefence against him is the Long River (Yangtse) and since Tsʻao has\r\ngained possession of Chingchou the river is his ally against us. We\r\ncannot withstand him, and the only way to tranquillity, in my opinion,\r\nis submission.”\r\n\r\n“The words of the speaker accord with the manifest decree of\r\nprovidence,” echoed all the assembly.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan remaining silent and thoughtful, Chang Chao again took up\r\nthe argument. “Do not hesitate, my lord. Submission to Tsʻao means\r\ntranquillity for the people of Wu and safety for the inhabitants of\r\nChiangnan.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan still remained silent, his head bent in deep thought.\r\nPresently he arose and paced slowly out at the door and Lu Su followed\r\nhim. Outside he took Lu by the hand, saying, “What do you desire?”\r\n\r\n“What they have all been saying is very derogatory to you. A common man\r\nmight submit; you cannot.”\r\n\r\n“Why? How do you explain that?”\r\n\r\n“If people like us submitted we could just return to our village, and\r\neverything would go on as before. If you submit, whither will you go?\r\nYou will be created a Marquis, perhaps. You will have one carriage, no\r\nmore, one saddle horse, that is all. Your retinue will be half a score.\r\nWill you be able to sit facing the south and call yourself by the\r\nkingly title of ‘the solitary’? Each one in your crowd of hangers-on is\r\nthinking for himself, is purely selfish, and you should not listen to\r\nthem, but take a line of your own and that quickly. Determine to play a\r\nbold game.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan sighed, “They all talk and talk, they miss my point of view.\r\nNow you have just spoken of a bold game and your view is the same as\r\nmine. Surely God has expressly sent you to me. Still Tsʻao is now the\r\nstronger by all Yüan Shao’s army and he has possession of Chingchou. I\r\nfear he is almost too powerful to contend with.”\r\n\r\n“I have brought back with me Chuko Liang, the brother of our Chuko\r\nChin. If you questioned him he would explain clearly.”\r\n\r\n“Is ‘Master Sleeping Dragon’ really here?”\r\n\r\n“Really here; in the guest-house.”\r\n\r\n“It is too late to see him to-day. But to-morrow I will assemble my\r\nofficials and you will introduce him to all my best. After that we will\r\ndebate the matter.”\r\n\r\nWith these instructions Lu Su retired. Next day he went to the\r\nguesthouse and conveyed Sun’s commands to the guest, particularly\r\nsaying, “When you see my master to-morrow, say nothing of the magnitude\r\nof Tsʻao’s army.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming smiled, saying, “I shall act as circumstances dictate; you\r\nmay be sure I shall make no mistakes.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming was then conducted to where the high officers, civil and\r\nmilitary to the number of two score and more, were assembled. They\r\nformed a dignified conclave as they sat in stately ranks with their\r\ntall headdresses and broad girdles.\r\n\r\nChang Chao sat at the head and Kʻung-ming first saluted him. Then, one\r\nby one, he exchanged the formal courtesies with them all. This done he\r\ntook his seat in the guest’s chair. They, on their part, noted with\r\ninterest his refined and elegant manner and his commanding figure,\r\nthinking within themselves, “Here is a man fitted for discourse.”\r\n\r\nChang Chao led the way in trying to bait the visitor. He said, “You\r\nwill pardon the most insignificant of our official circle, myself, if I\r\nmention that people say you compare yourself with those two famous men\r\nof talent, Kuan Chung and Yo I. Is there any truth in this?”\r\n\r\n“To a trifling extent I have compared myself with them,” replied\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“I have heard that Liu Pei made three journeys to visit you when you\r\nlived in retirement in your simple dwelling, and that when you\r\nconsented to serve him he said he was as lucky as a fish in getting\r\nhome to the ocean. Then he desired to possess the district about\r\nChingchou and Hsiangyang. Yet to-day all that country belongs to Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao. I should like to hear your account of all that.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming thought, “This Chang is Sun Chʻüan’s first adviser and\r\nunless I can nonplus him I shall never have a chance with his master.”\r\nSo he replied, “In my opinion the taking of the district around the Han\r\nRiver was as simple as turning over one’s hand. But my master Liu is\r\nboth righteous and humane and would not stoop to filching the\r\npossession of a member of his own house. So he refused the offer of\r\nsuccession. But Liu Tsʻung, a stupid lad, misled by specious words,\r\nsubmitted to Tsʻao and fell victim to his ferocity. My master is in\r\ncamp at Chianghsia, but what his future plans may be cannot be divulged\r\nat present.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so; but your words and your deeds are something discordant. You\r\nsay you are the equal of the two famous ones. Well, Kuan Chung as\r\nMinister of Duke Kuan, put his master at the very head of the feudal\r\nnobles, making his master’s will supreme in all the land. Under the\r\nable statesmanship of Yo I the feeble country of Yen conquered Chʻi,\r\nreducing nearly four score of its cities. These two were men of most\r\ncommanding and conspicuous talent. When you lived in retirement you\r\nsmiled scornfully at ordinary people, passed your days in idleness,\r\nnursing your knees and posing in a superior manner, implying that if\r\nyou had control of affairs Liu Pei would be more than human; he should\r\nbring good to everybody and remove all evil; rebellion and robbery\r\nwould be no more. Poor Liu, before he obtained your help, was an\r\noutcast and a vagabond, stealing a city here and there where he could.\r\nWith you to help him he was to become the cynosure of every eye and\r\nevery lisping school boy was to say that he was a tiger who had grown\r\nwings. The Hans were to be restored and Tsʻao and his faction\r\nexterminated. The good old days would be restored and all the men who\r\nhad been driven into retirement by the corruption of political life\r\nwould wake up, rub the sleep out of their eyes and be in readiness to\r\nlift the cloud of darkness that covered the sky and gaze up at the\r\nglorious brilliancy of the sun and moon, to pull the people out of fire\r\nand water and put all the world to rest on a couch of comfort. That was\r\nall to happen forthwith. Why then, when you went to Yüchou, did not\r\nTsʻao’s army throw aside their arms and armour and flee like rats? Why\r\ncould you not have told Liu Piao how to give tranquillity to his\r\npeople? Why could you not aid his orphan son to protect his frontiers?\r\nInstead you abandoned Hsinyeh and fled to Fanchʻêng; you were defeated\r\nat Tangyang; you fled to Hsiakʻou with no place to rest in. Thus, after\r\nyou had joined Liu Pei, he was worse off than before. Was it thus with\r\nKuan Chung and Yo I? I trust you do not mind my blunt speech.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming waited till he had closed his oration, then laughed and\r\nsaid, “How can the common birds understand the long flight of the roc?\r\nLet me use an illustration. A man has fallen into a terrible malady.\r\nFirst the physician must administer hashish, then soothing drugs until\r\nhis viscera shall be calmed into harmonious action. When the sick man’s\r\nbody shall have been reduced to quietude, then may he be given strong\r\nmeats to strengthen him and powerful drugs to correct the disorder.\r\nThus the disease will be quite expelled and the man restored to health.\r\nIf the physician does not wait till the humours and pulse are in\r\nharmony, but throws in his strong drugs too early, it will be difficult\r\nto restore the patient. My master suffered defeat at Junan and went to\r\nLiu Piao. He had then less than one company of soldiers and only three\r\ncaptains. That was indeed a time of extreme weakness. Hsinyeh was a\r\nsecluded, rustic town with few inhabitants and scanty supplies, and my\r\nmaster only retired there as a temporary refuge. How could he even\r\nthink of occupying and holding it? Yet, with insufficient force, in a\r\nweak city, with untrained men and inadequate supplies, a camp was\r\nburned, two leaders and their army were nearly drowned and were\r\nfrightened into running away. I doubt whether your two ancient heroes\r\nwould have done any better. As to the surrender of Liu Tsʻung, Liu Pei\r\nknew nothing of it. And he was too noble and too righteous to take\r\nadvantage of a kinsman’s straits to seize his inheritance. As for the\r\ndefeat at Tangyang it must be remembered that Liu Pei was hampered with\r\na huge voluntary following of common people, with their aged relatives\r\nand their children, whom he was too humane to abandon. He never thought\r\nof taking Chiangling, but willingly suffered with his people. This is a\r\nstriking instance of his magnanimity. Small forces are no match for\r\nlarge armies. Victory and defeat are common episodes in every campaign.\r\nThe great Founder of the Hans suffered many defeats at the hands of\r\nHsiang Yü, but he finally conquered at Haihsia and that battle was\r\ndecisive. Was not this due to the strategy of Han Hsin who, though he\r\nhad long served his master, had never won a victory. Indeed real\r\nstatesmanship, the restoration of stable government is a master plan\r\nfar removed from the vapid discourses and debates of a lot of bragging\r\nbabblers and specious and deceitful talkers, who, as they themselves\r\nsay, are immeasurably superior to the rest of mankind but who, when it\r\ncomes to deeds and decisions to meet the infinite and constant\r\nvicissitudes of affairs, fail to throw up a single capable man. Truly\r\nsuch people are the laughing stock of all the world.”\r\n\r\nChang Chao found no reply to this diatribe but another in the assembly\r\nlifted up his voice, saying, “But what of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s present\r\nposition? There he is, encamped with many legions and numberless\r\nleaders. Whither he goes he is invincible and whither he looks he is\r\nfearsome. He has taken Chianghsia already, as we see.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Yü Fan and Kʻung-ming replied, “Tsʻao has acquired the\r\nswarms of Yüan Shao and stolen the crowds of Liu Piao. Yet I care not\r\nfor all his legions.”\r\n\r\nYü Fan smiled icily, “When you got thrashed at Tangyang and in\r\ndesperation sent this way and that to ask help, even then did you not\r\ncare? But do you think big talk really takes people in?”\r\n\r\n“Liu had a few companies of scrupulous soldiers to oppose to a hundred\r\nlegions of fierce brutes. He retired to Hsiakʻou for breathing space.\r\nThe soldiers of Chiangtung are good and there are ample supplies and\r\nthe Long River is a defence. Is now a time for him to bend the knee\r\nbefore a renegade, to be careless of his honour and reputation? As a\r\nfact Liu is not the sort of man to fear such a rebel as Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\nYü Fan had nothing to reply. Next, one Pu Chih, who was among those\r\nseated, said, “Will you talk of our land of Wu with a tongue like the\r\ntongues of Chang I and Su Chʻin of old?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “You regard those two as mere speculative talkers:\r\nyou do not recognise them also as heroes. Su Chʻin bore the prime\r\nminister’s seals of six federated states; Chang I was twice prime\r\nMinister of Chʻin. Both were men of conspicuous ability who brought\r\nabout the reformation of their governments. They are not to be compared\r\nwith those who quail before the strong and overbear the weak, who fear\r\nthe dagger and run away from the sword. You, Sir, have listened to\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s crafty and empty rhodomontade and it has frightened you\r\ninto advising surrender. Dare you ridicule Su Chin and Chang I?”\r\n\r\nPu Chih was silenced. Then suddenly another interjected the question,\r\n“What do you think of Tsʻao Tsʻao?”\r\n\r\nIt was Hsüeh Tsung who had spoken and Kʻung-ming replied, “Tsʻao is one\r\nof the rebels against the dynasty; why ask about him?”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken,” said Hsüeh Tsung. “The Hans have outlasted their\r\nallotted time and the end is near. Tsʻao already has two-thirds of the\r\nempire and people are turning to him. Your master has not recognised\r\nthe fateful moment and to contend with a man so strong is to try to\r\nsmash stones with eggs. Failure is certain.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming angrily replied, “Why do you speak so undutifully, as if you\r\nknew neither father nor prince? Loyalty and filial duty are the\r\nessentials of a man’s being. For a minister of Han correct conduct\r\ndemands that one is pledged to the destruction of any one who does not\r\nfollow the canon of a minister’s duty. Tsʻao’s forbears enjoyed the\r\nbounty of Han, but instead of showing gratitude, he nourishes in his\r\nbosom thoughts of rebellion. The whole world is incensed against him\r\nand yet you would claim for him the indication of destiny. Truly you\r\nare a man who knows neither father nor prince, a man unworthy of any\r\nwords, and I decline to argue with you farther.”\r\n\r\nThe blush of shame overspread Hsüeh’s face and he said no more. But\r\nanother, one Lu Chi, took up the dispute and said, “Although Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao overawes the Emperor and in his name coerces the nobles, yet he\r\nis the descendant of a minister, while your master, though he says he\r\nis descended from a prince, has no proof thereof. In the eyes of the\r\nworld he is just a weaver of mats, a seller of straw shoes. Who is he\r\nto strive with Tsʻao?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming laughed and replied, “Are you not that Lu who pocketed the\r\norange when you were sitting among Yüan Shao’s guests? Listen to me; I\r\nhave a word to say to you. Inasmuch as Tsʻao Tsʻao is a descendant of a\r\nminister of state he is by heredity a servant of the Hans. But now he\r\nhas monopolised all state authority and knows only his own arbitrary\r\nwill, heaping every indignity upon his lord. Not only does he forget\r\nhis prince, but he ignores his ancestors; not only is he a rebellious\r\nservant of Han, but the renegade of his family. Liu Pei of Yuchou is a\r\nnoble scion of the imperial family upon whom the Emperor has conferred\r\nrank, as is recorded in the annals. How then can you say there is no\r\nevidence of his imperial origin? Beside, the very founder of the\r\ndynasty was himself of lowly origin, and yet he became emperor. Where\r\nis the shame in weaving mats and selling shoes? Your mean, immature\r\nviews are unfit to be mentioned in the presence of scholars of\r\nstanding.”\r\n\r\nThis put a stop to Lu Chi’s flow of eloquence, but another of those\r\npresent said, “Kʻung-ming’s words are overbearing and he distorts\r\nreason. It is not proper argument and he had better say no more. But I\r\nwould ask him what classical canon he studied.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming looked at his interlocutor, who was named Yen Chün, and\r\nsaid, “The dryasdusts of every age select passages and choose phrases;\r\nwhat else are they good for? Do they ever initiate a policy or manage\r\nan affair? I Yin, who was a farmer in Hsin and Tzŭ-ya, the fisherman of\r\nthe Wei River, Chang Liang and Chʻên Pʻing, Têng Yü and Kêng Yen all\r\nwere men of transcendent ability, but I have never enquired what\r\nclassical canon they followed or on whose essays they formed their\r\nstyle. Would you liken them to your rusty students of books, whose\r\njourneyings are comprised between their brush and their inkstone, who\r\nspend their days in literary futilities, wasting both time and ink?”\r\n\r\nNo reply was forthcoming; the speaker hung his head with shame. But\r\nanother disputant, Chʻêng Tê-shu by name, suddenly shouted, “You are\r\nmightily fond of big words, Sir, but they do not give any proof of your\r\nscholarship after all. I am inclined to think that a real scholar would\r\njust laugh at you.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “There are scholars and scholars. There is the\r\nnoble scholar, loyal and patriotic, of perfect rectitude and a hater of\r\nany crookedness. The concern of such a scholar is to act in full\r\nsympathy with his day and leave to future ages a fine reputation. There\r\nis the scholar of the mean type, a pedant and nothing more. He labours\r\nconstantly with his pen, in his callow youth composing odes and in\r\nhoary age still striving to understand the classical books completely.\r\nThousands of words flow from his pen but there is not a solid idea in\r\nhis breast. He may, as did Yang Hsiung, glorify the age with his\r\nwritings and yet stoop to serve a tyrant such as Mang. No wonder Yang\r\nthrew himself out of a window; he had to. That is the way of the\r\nscholar of mean type. Though he composes odes by the hundred, what is\r\nthe use of him?”\r\n\r\nChʻêng could make no reply. The other officers now began to hold this\r\nman of torrential speech in wholesome fear. Only two of them had failed\r\nto challenge him, but when they would have tried to pose Kʻung-ming,\r\nsuddenly some one appeared from without and angrily shouted, “This is\r\nnot paying fit respect to a guest. You have among you the most\r\nwonderful man of the day and you all sit there trying to entangle him\r\nin speech while our arch enemy Tsʻao Tsʻao is nearing our borders.\r\nInstead of discussing how to oppose him you are all wrangling and\r\ndisputing.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned toward him; it was Huang Kai, of Lingling, who was\r\nmaster of the commissariat of Wu. He turned to address Kʻung-ming,\r\nsaying, “There is a saying that though something may be gained by talk\r\nthere is more to be got by silence. Why not give my lord the advantage\r\nof your valuable advice instead of wasting time in discussion with this\r\ncrowd?”\r\n\r\n“They did not understand,” replied Kʻung-ming, “and it was necessary to\r\nenlighten them, I had to speak.”\r\n\r\nAs Huang Kai and Lu Su led the guest toward their master’s apartments,\r\nthey met his brother Chuko Chin. Kʻung-ming saluted him with the\r\ndeference due to an elder brother and Chin said, “Why have you not been\r\nto see me, brother?”\r\n\r\n“I am now in the service of Liu of Yü chou and it is right that public\r\naffairs precede private obligations. I cannot attend to any private\r\nmatters till my work is done. You must pardon me, brother.”\r\n\r\n“After you have seen the Marquis you will come and tell me your news,”\r\nsaid he as he left.\r\n\r\nAs they went along to the audience chamber Lu Su again cautioned\r\nKʻung-ming against any rash speech. The latter nodded but made no other\r\nreply. When they reached the hall Sun Chʻüan came down the steps to\r\nwelcome his guests and was extraordinarily gracious. After the mutual\r\nsalutations the guest was given a chair while the Marquis’s officials\r\nwere drawn up in two lines, on one side the civil, on the other the\r\nmilitary. Lu Su stood beside Kʻung-ming and listened to his\r\nintroductory speech.\r\n\r\nAs Kʻung-ming spoke of Yüan-tê’s intentions, he glanced up at his host.\r\nHe noted the grey eyes and brown beard and the dignified commanding air\r\nof the man and thought within himself, “Certainly in appearance this is\r\nno common man. He is one to be incited perhaps, but not to be\r\npersuaded. It will be better to see what he has to say first, then I\r\nwill try to stir him to action.”\r\n\r\nThe serving of tea being now finished, Sun Chʻüan began with the usual\r\ngracious ceremonial expressions.\r\n\r\n“Lu Su has often spoken of your genius” said the host; “it is a great\r\npleasure to meet you. I trust you will confer upon me the advantage of\r\nyour instruction.”\r\n\r\n“I am neither clever nor learned” was the reply, “it humiliates me to\r\nhear such words.”\r\n\r\n“You have been at Hsinyeh lately and you helped your master to fight\r\nthat decisive battle with Tsʻao Tsʻao, so you must know exactly the\r\nmeasure of his military strength.”\r\n\r\n“My master’s army was small and his generals were few; the city was\r\npaltry and lacked supplies. Hence no stand could be made against such a\r\nforce as Tsʻao Tsʻao had.”\r\n\r\n“How many men has he in all?”\r\n\r\n“Horse and foot, land and marine, he has a hundred legions.”\r\n\r\n“Is there not some doubt about that?” said Sun Chʻüan.\r\n\r\n“None whatever; when Tsʻao Tsʻao went to Yenchou he had the twenty\r\nlegions of Chingchou. He gained fifty or sixty legions when Yüan Shao\r\nfell. He has thirty or forty legions newly recruited in the capital.\r\nLately he has acquired twenty or thirty legions in Chingchou. And if\r\nthese be reckoned up the total is not less than a hundred and fifty.\r\nHence I said a hundred for I was afraid of frightening your officers.”\r\n\r\nLu Su was much disturbed and turned pale. He looked meaningly at the\r\nbold speaker, but Kʻung-ming would not see. Sun Chʻüan went on to ask\r\nif his arch enemy had a corresponding number of leaders.\r\n\r\n“He has enough administrators and strategists to control such a host\r\nand his capable and veteran leaders are more than a thousand; perhaps\r\nmore than two thousand.”\r\n\r\n“What will be Tsʻao Tsʻao’s next move now that he has overcome\r\nChingchou and Chʻu?”\r\n\r\n“He is camped along the river and he has collected a fleet. If he does\r\nnot intend to invade your territory, what can be his intentions?”\r\n\r\n“Since that is his intention, it is a case of fight or not fight. I\r\nwish you would decide that for me.”\r\n\r\n“I have something I could say, but I fear, Sir, you would not care to\r\nhear it.”\r\n\r\n“I am desirous of hearing your most valuable opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Strife has prevailed for a long time and so you should raise your army\r\nand Liu Pei should collect his forces south of the Han River, to act\r\nwith you in contest for the empire against Tsʻao Tsʻao. Now Tsʻao has\r\novercome most of his difficulties and his recent conquest of Chingchou\r\nhas won him great and wide renown. Though there might be one bold\r\nenough to tackle him, yet there is no foothold for such. That is how\r\nLiu Pei has been forced to come here. But, General, I wish you to\r\nmeasure your forces and decide whether you can venture to meet him and\r\nthat without loss of time. If you cannot, then follow the advice of\r\nyour councillors; cease your military preparations and yield; turn your\r\nface to the north and serve.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan did not reply. But his guest went on, “You have the\r\nreputation of being reasonable but I know also you are inclined to\r\nhesitate. Still this matter is most important and evil will be quickly\r\nupon you if you do not decide.”\r\n\r\nThen replied Sun, “If what you say represents the actual conditions,\r\nwhy does not Liu Pei yield?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know Tsʻien Hêng, that hero of the state of Chʻi; his\r\ncharacter was too noble for him to submit to any shame. It is necessary\r\nto remember that Liu Pei also is an off-shoot from the dynastic family,\r\nbeside being a man of great renown. Every one looks up to him. His lack\r\nof success is simply the will of Heaven but manifestly he could not bow\r\nthe knee to any one.”\r\n\r\nThese last words touched Sun Chʻüan to the quick and he could not\r\ncontrol his anger. He shook out his sleeves, rose and left the audience\r\nchamber. Those present smiled at each other as they dispersed.\r\n\r\nBut Lu Su was annoyed and reproached Kʻung-ming for his maladroit way\r\nof talking to Sun. “Luckily for you my lord is too large-minded to\r\nrebuke you to your face for you spoke to him most contemptuously.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming threw back his head and laughed. “What a sensitive fellow it\r\nis!” cried he. “I know how Tsʻao Tsʻao could be destroyed, but he never\r\nasked me; so I said nothing.”\r\n\r\n“If you really do know how that could be done I will certainly beg my\r\nlord to ask you.”\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao’s hosts in my eyes are but as swarms of ants. I have but\r\nto lift my hand and they will be crushed.”\r\n\r\nLu Su at once went into his master’s private room, where he found him\r\nstill very irritable and angry. “Kʻung-ming insulted me too deeply,”\r\nsaid Sun.\r\n\r\n“I have already reproached him,” said Lu Su, “and he laughed and said\r\nyou were too sensitive. He would not give you any advice without being\r\nasked for it. Why did you not seek advice from him, my lord?”\r\n\r\nAt once Sun’s anger changed to joy. He said, “So he had a plan ready\r\nand his words were meant to provoke me. I did despise him for a moment\r\nand it has very nearly lost me.”\r\n\r\nSo he returned to the audience chamber where the guest was still seated\r\nand begged Kʻung-ming to continue his speech. He spoke courteously\r\nsaying, “I offended you just now, I hope you are not implacable.”\r\n\r\n“And I also was rude,” replied Kʻung-ming. “I entreat pardon.”\r\n\r\nHost and guest retired to the inner room where wine was served. After\r\nit had gone round several times, Sun Chʻüan said, “The enemies of Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao were Lü Pu, Liu Piao, Yüan Shao, Yüan Shu, his brother, Liu Pei\r\nand my poor self. Now most of these are gone and only Liu Pei and I\r\nremain. I will never allow the land of Wu to be dictated to by another.\r\nThe only one who could have withstood Tsʻao Tsʻao was Liu Pei, but he\r\nhas been defeated lately and what can he do now against such force?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “Although defeated, Liu Pei still has Kuan Yü with\r\na legion of veterans. And Liu Chʻi still leads the men of Chianghsia,\r\nanother legion. Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army is far from home and the men are\r\nworn out. They made a frantic effort to come up with my master, and the\r\nlight horse marched three hundred li in a day and a night. This was the\r\nfinal kick of the crossbow spring and the bolt was not swift enough to\r\npenetrate even the thin silken vesture of Lu. The army can do no more.\r\nThey are northern men, unskilled in water warfare, and the men of\r\nChingchou are unwilling supporters. They have no desire to help Tsʻao.\r\nNow if you, General, will assist Liu Pei, Tsʻao will certainly be\r\nbroken and he must retire northwards. Then your country and Chingchou\r\nwill be strong and firmly established. But the scheme must be carried\r\nout without delay and only you can decide.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan joyfully replied, “Your words, master, open up the road\r\nclearly. I have decided and shall have no further doubts.”\r\n\r\nSo the orders were issued forthwith to prepare for a joint attack on\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao. And he bade Lu Su bear the news of his decision to all his\r\nofficers. He himself escorted Kʻung-ming to the guest quarters and saw\r\nto his comfort.\r\n\r\nWhen Chang Chao heard of the decision he met his colleagues and said to\r\nthem, “He has fallen into the trap set by this Kʻung-ming.”\r\n\r\nThey went in a body to their lord and said, “We hear you are going to\r\nattack Tsʻao Tsʻao; but how do you stand when compared with Yüan Shao?\r\nIn those days Tsʻao was comparatively weak and yet he overcame. What is\r\nhe like to-day with his countless legions? He is not to be lightly\r\nattacked and to listen to Chuko Liang’s advice to engage in a conflict\r\nis like carrying fuel to a fire.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan made no reply and Ku Yung took up the argument. “Liu Pei has\r\nbeen defeated and he wants to borrow our help to beat his enemy. Why\r\nmust our lord lend himself to his schemes? Pray listen to our leader’s\r\nwords.”\r\n\r\nDoubts again surged up in the mind of Sun Chʻüan. When the troop of\r\nadvisers had retired, Lu Su came in saying, “They came to exhort you\r\nnot to fight, but to compel you to surrender simply because they wish\r\nto secure the safety of their families. They distort their sense of\r\nduty to serve their own ends and I hope you will not take their\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan being sunk in thought and saying nothing, Lu Su went on, “if\r\nyou hesitate you will certainly be led astray by the majority and——”\r\n\r\n“Retire for a time,” said his master. “I must think it over carefully.”\r\n\r\nSo Lu Su left the chamber. Among the soldiers some wished for war, but\r\nof the civil officers, all were in favour of surrender and so there\r\nwere many discussions and much conflict of opinion. Sun Chʻüan went to\r\nhis private apartments greatly perplexed. There his worry was easily\r\ndiscernible and he neither ate nor slept. He was quite unable to decide\r\nfinally upon a course of action.\r\n\r\nThen the Lady Wu asked him what so troubled him, and he told her of the\r\nthreatened danger and the different opinions his advisers held one and\r\nanother and all his doubts and fears. If he fought, he might fail; and\r\nif he offered to surrender, perhaps Tsʻao Tsʻao would reject his\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nThen she replied, “Have you forgotten the last words of my sister?”\r\n\r\nAs to one recovering from a fit of drunkenness, or waking out of a\r\ndream, so came to him the dying words of the mother who bore him.\r\n\r\n\r\n        His mother’s advice he called to mind,\r\n        “In Chou Yü’s counsels you safety find.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happened will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nKʻUNG-MING STIRS CHOU YÜ TO ACTION:\r\nSUN CHʻÜAN DECIDES TO ATTACK TSʻAO TSʻAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dying message which the Lady Wu recalled to Sun Chʻüan’s memory\r\nwas, “For internal matters consult Chang Chao; for external policy Chou\r\nYü.”\r\n\r\nWherefore Chou Yü was summoned.\r\n\r\nBut he was already on the way. He had been training his naval forces on\r\nLake Pʻoyang when he heard of the approach of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s hosts and\r\nhad started for Chʻaisengchün without loss of time. So, before the\r\nmessenger ordered to call him could start, he had already arrived. As\r\nhe and Lu Su were close friends the latter went to welcome him and told\r\nhim of all that had happened.\r\n\r\n“Have no anxiety,” said Chou Yü, “I shall be able to decide this. But\r\ngo quickly and beg Kʻung-ming to come to see me.”\r\n\r\nSo Lu Su went to seek out Kʻung-ming. Chou Yü had many other visitors.\r\nFirst came Chang Chao and his faction to find out what might be afoot.\r\nThey were received, and after the exchange of the usual commonplaces,\r\nChang Chao said, “Have you heard of our terrible danger?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard nothing,” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao and his hordes are encamped up the river. He has just sent\r\nletters asking our lord to hunt with him in Chianghsia. He may have a\r\ndesire to absorb this country but, if so, the details of his designs\r\nare still secret. We prayed our master to give in his submission and so\r\navoid the horrors of war, but now Lu Su has returned bringing with him\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief of Liu Pei’s army, Chuko Liang. He, desiring to\r\navenge himself for the recent defeat, has talked our lord into a mind\r\nfor war and Lu Su persists in supporting him. They only await your\r\nfinal decision.”\r\n\r\n“Are you and yours unanimous in your opinions?”\r\n\r\n“We are perfectly unanimous,” said Chang.\r\n\r\nChou said, “The fact is I have also desired to submit for a long time.\r\nI beg you to leave me now and to-morrow we will see our master and I\r\nshall make up his mind for him.”\r\n\r\nSo they took their leave. Very soon came the military party led by\r\nChʻêng Pʻu. They were admitted and duly enquired after their host’s\r\nhealth. Then the leader said, “Have you heard that our country is about\r\nto pass under another’s government?”\r\n\r\n“No; I have heard nothing,” replied the host.\r\n\r\n“We helped General Sun to establish his authority here and carve out\r\nthis kingdom, and to gain that end we fought many a battle before we\r\nconquered the country. Now our lord lends his ear to his civil officers\r\nand desires to submit himself to Tsʻao Tsʻao. This is a most shameful\r\nand pitiful course and we would rather die than follow it, so we hope\r\nyou will decide to fight and you may depend upon our struggling to the\r\nlast man.”\r\n\r\n“And are you unanimous, Generals?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nHuang Kai suddenly started up and smote his forehead saying, “They may\r\ntake my head but I swear never to surrender.”\r\n\r\n“Not one of us is willing to surrender,” cried all the others.\r\n\r\n“My desire also is to decide matters with Tsʻao Tsʻao on the\r\nbattlefield. How could we think of submission? Now I pray you retire,\r\nGenerals, and when I see our lord I will settle his doubts.”\r\n\r\nSo the war party left. They were quickly succeeded by Chuko Ching and\r\nhis faction. They were brought in and, after the usual courtesies,\r\nChing said, “My brother has come down the river saying that Liu Pei\r\ndesires to ally himself with our lord against Tsʻao Tsʻao. The civil\r\nand military hold different opinions as to the course to be pursued,\r\nbut as my brother is so deeply concerned I am unwilling to say much on\r\neither side. We are awaiting your decision.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think about it?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Submission is an easy road to tranquillity, while the result of war is\r\nhard to foretell.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü smiled, “I shall have my mind made up. Come to-morrow to the\r\npalace and the decision shall be announced.”\r\n\r\nThe trimmers took their leave. But soon after came Lü Mêng with his\r\nsupporters, also desirous of discussing the same thing, and they told\r\nhim that opinions differed greatly, some being for peace and others for\r\nwar. One party constantly disputed with the other.\r\n\r\n“I must not say much now,” replied Chou Yü, “but you will see to-morrow\r\nin the palace, when the matter will be fully debated.”\r\n\r\nThey went away leaving Chou Yü smiling cynically.\r\n\r\nAbout eventide Lu Su and Kʻung-ming came and Chou Yü went out to the\r\nmain gate to receive them. When they had taken their proper seats, Lu\r\nSu spoke first, saying, “Tsʻao Tsʻao has come against the south with a\r\nhuge army. Our master cannot decide whether to submit or give battle\r\nand waits for your decision. What is your opinion?”\r\n\r\nChou Yü replied, “We may not oppose Tsʻao Tsʻao when he acts at the\r\ncommand of the Emperor. Moreover, he is very strong and to attack him\r\nis to take serious risks. In my opinion, opposition would mean defeat\r\nand, since submission means peace, I have decided to advise our lord to\r\nwrite and offer surrender.”\r\n\r\n“But you are wrong,” stammered Lu Su. “This country has been under the\r\nsame rule for three generations and cannot be suddenly abandoned to\r\nsome other. San Tsʻê said that you were to be consulted on matters\r\nbeyond the border and we depended upon you to keep the country as\r\nsecure and solid as Mount Tʻai. Now you adopt the view of the weaklings\r\nand propose to yield! I cannot believe you mean it.”\r\n\r\nReplied Chou Yü, “The six districts contain countless people. If I am\r\nthe means of bringing upon them the misery of war they will hate me. So\r\nI have decided to advise submission.”\r\n\r\n“But do you not realise our lord’s might and the strength of our\r\ncountry? If Tsʻao does attack it is very uncertain that he will realise\r\nhis desire.”\r\n\r\nThe two wrangled for a long time, while Kʻung-ming sat smiling with\r\nfolded arms. Presently Chou Yü asked why he smiled thus and he replied,\r\n“I am smiling at no other than your opponent Lu Su, who knows nothing\r\nof the affairs of the day.”\r\n\r\n“Master,” said Lu Su, “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, this intention to submit is perfectly reasonable; it is the one\r\nproper thing.”\r\n\r\n“There!” exclaimed Chou Yü, “Kʻung-ming knows the times perfectly well\r\nand he agrees with me.”\r\n\r\n“But, both of you, why do you say this?” said Lu.\r\n\r\nSaid Kʻung-ming, “Tsʻao is an excellent commander, so good that no one\r\ndares oppose him. Only very few have ever attempted it and they have\r\nbeen exterminated; the world knows them no more. The only exception is\r\nLiu Pei, who did not understand the conditions and vigorously contended\r\nagainst him, with the result that he is now at Chianghsia in a very\r\nparlous state. To submit is to secure the safety of wives and children,\r\nto be rich and honoured. But the dignity of the country would be left\r\nto chance and fate—— However, that is not worth consideration.”\r\n\r\nLu Su interrupted angrily, “Would you make our lord crook the knee to\r\nsuch a rebel as he?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Kʻung-ming, “there is another way, and a cheaper; there\r\nwould be no need to ‘lead the sheep and shoulder wine pots’ for\r\npresents, nor any need to yield territory and surrender seals of\r\noffice. It would not even be necessary to cross the river yourselves.\r\nAll you would require is a simple messenger and a little boat to ferry\r\na couple of people across the river. If Tsʻao only got these two\r\npersons under his hand, his hordes and legions would just drop their\r\nweapons, furl their banners and silently vanish away.”\r\n\r\n“What two persons could cause Tsʻao Tsʻao to go away as you say?” asked\r\nChou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Two persons who could be easily spared from this populous country.\r\nThey would not be missed any more than a leaf from a tree or a grain of\r\nmillet from a granary. But if Tsʻao could only get them, would he not\r\ngo away rejoicing!”\r\n\r\n“But who are the two?” asked Chou Yü again.\r\n\r\n“When I was living in the country they told me that Tsʻao was building\r\na pavilion on the Chang River; it was to be named the Bronze Bird\r\nPavilion. It is an exceedingly handsome building and he has sought\r\nthroughout all the world for the most beautiful women to live in it.\r\nFor Tsʻao really is a sensualist.”\r\n\r\n“Now there are two very famous beauties in Chiantung, born of the\r\nChʻiao family. So beautiful are they that birds alight and fishes\r\ndrown, the moon hides her face and the flowers blush for shame at sight\r\nof them. Tsʻao has declared with an oath that he only wants two things\r\nin this world, the imperial throne in peace and the sight of those two\r\nwomen on the Bronze Bird Terraces. Given these two he would go down to\r\nhis grave without regret. This expedition of his, his huge army that\r\nthreatens this country, has for its real aim these two women. Why do\r\nyou not buy these two from their father for any sum however large and\r\nsend them over the river? The object of the army being attained, it\r\nwill simply be marched away. This is the use that Fan Li made of the\r\nfamous beauty Hsi Shih.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know he so greatly desires these two?” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Because his son, who is an able writer, at the command of his father\r\nwrote a poem ‘An Ode to the Bronze Bird Terrace,’ the theme only\r\nallowing allusions to the family fitness for the throne. He has sworn\r\nto possess these two women. I think I can remember the poem, if you\r\nwish to hear it. I admire it greatly.”\r\n\r\n“Try,” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nSo he recited the poem:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let me follow in the footsteps of the enlightened ruler that I\r\n                                                           may rejoice,\r\n    And ascend the storied terrace that I may gladden my heart,\r\n    That I may see the wide extent of the palace,\r\n    That I may gaze upon the plans of the virtuous one.\r\n    He has established the exalted gates high as the hills,\r\n    He has built the lofty towers piercing the blue vault.\r\n    He has set up the beautiful building in the midst of the heavens,\r\n    Whence the eye can range over the cities of the west.\r\n    On the banks of the rolling River Chang he planned it,\r\n    Whence abundance of fruits could be looked for in his gardens.\r\n    The two towers rise, one on either flank,\r\n    This named Golden Phoenix, that Jade Dragon.\r\n    He would seize the two Chʻiao; these beautiful ladies of the\r\n                                                            south-east,\r\n    That he might rejoice with them morning and evening.\r\n    Look down; there is the grand beauty of an imperial city,\r\n    And the rolling vapours lie floating beneath.\r\n    He will rejoice in the multitude of scholars that assemble,\r\n    Answering to the felicitous dream of King Wên.\r\n    Look up; and there is the gorgeous harmony of spring-time,\r\n    And the singing of many birds delighting the ear;\r\n    The lofty sky stands over all.\r\n    The house desires success in its double undertaking,\r\n    That the humane influence may be poured out over all the world,\r\n    That the perfection of reverence may be offered to the Ruler.\r\n    Only the richly prosperous rule of Huan and Wên\r\n    Could compare with that of the sacred understanding.\r\n    What fortune! what beauty!\r\n    The gracious kindness spreads afar,\r\n    The imperial family is supported,\r\n    Peace reigns over all the world,\r\n    Bounded only by the universe.\r\n    Bright as the glory of the sun and moon,\r\n    Ever honourable and ever enduring,\r\n    The Ruler shall live to the age of the eastern emperor,\r\n    The dragon banner shall wave to the farthest limit.\r\n    His glorious chariot shall be guided with perfect wisdom,\r\n    His thoughts shall reform all the world,\r\n    Felicitous produce shall be abundant,\r\n    And the people shall rest firm.\r\n    My desire is that these towers shall endure for ever,\r\n    And that joy shall never cease through all the ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nChou Yü listened to the end but then suddenly jumped up in a tremendous\r\nrage. Turning to the north and pointing with his finger he cried, “You\r\nold rebel; this insult is too deep!”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming hastily rose too and, as if to soothe him, said, “But\r\nremember Shan Yü. The emperor gave him a princess of the family to wife\r\nalthough he had made many incursions into our territory. That was the\r\nprice of peace. You surely would not grudge two more women from among\r\nthe people.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know, Sir,” replied Chou Yü. “Of those two women you\r\nmentioned, the elder is the widow of Sun Tsʻê, our late ruler, and the\r\nyounger is my wife.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming feigned the greatest astonishment and said, “No indeed; I\r\ndid not know. I blundered; a deadly fault; a deadly fault!”\r\n\r\n“One of us two has to go, either the old rebel or I; we shall not both\r\nlive. I swear that,” cried Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“However, such a matter needs a good deal of thought,” replied\r\nKʻung-ming. “We must not make any mistake.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü replied, “I hold a sacred trust from my late lord, Sun Tsʻê; I\r\nwould not bow the knee to any such as Tsʻao. What I said just now was\r\nto see how you stood. I left the lake with the intention of attacking\r\nthe north, and nothing can change that intention, not even the sword at\r\nmy breast or the axe on my neck. But I trust you will lend an arm and\r\nwe will smite Tsʻao Tsʻao together.”\r\n\r\n“Should I be happy enough not to be rejected I would render such humble\r\nservice as I could. Perhaps presently I might be able to offer a plan\r\nto oppose him.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to see my lord to-morrow to discuss this matter,” said Chou\r\nYü.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming and Lu Su then left. Next day at dawn Sun Chʻüan went to the\r\ncouncil chamber, where his officials, civil and military, were already\r\nassembled. They numbered about three score in all. The civil, with\r\nChang Chao at their head, were on the right; the military, with Chʻêng\r\nPʻu as their leader, were ranged on the left. All were in full\r\nceremonial dress and the swords of the soldiers clanked on the\r\npavement. Soon Chou Yü entered and, when Sun Chʻüan had finished the\r\nusual gracious remarks, he said, “I hear that Tsʻao Tsʻao is encamped\r\non the river and has sent a despatch to you, my lord; I would ask what\r\nyour opinion is.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the despatch was produced and handed to Chou Yü. After\r\nreading it through he said, smiling, “The old thief thinks there are no\r\nmen in this land that he writes in this contemptuous strain.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Sir?” asked Sun Chʻüan.\r\n\r\n“Have you discussed this with the officials?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“We have been discussing this for days. Some counsel surrender and some\r\nadvise fight. I am undecided and therefore I have asked you to come and\r\ndecide the point.”\r\n\r\n“Who advise surrender?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Chang Chao and his party are firmly set in this opinion.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü then turned to Chang Chao and said, “I should be pleased to\r\nhear why you are for surrender, Master.”\r\n\r\nThen Chang Chao replied, “Tsʻao Tsʻao has been attacking all opponents\r\nin the name of the Emperor, who is entirely in his hands. He does\r\neverything in the name of the government. Lately he has taken Chingchou\r\nand thereby increased his prestige. Our defence against him was the\r\nriver, but now he also has a large fleet and can attack by water. How\r\ncan we withstand him? Wherefore I counsel submission till some chance\r\nshall offer.”\r\n\r\n“This is but the opinion of an ill-advised student,” said Chou Yü. “How\r\ncan you think of abandoning this country that we have held for three\r\ngenerations?”\r\n\r\n“That being so,” said Sun Chʻüan, “where is a plan to come from?”\r\n\r\n“Though Tsʻao Tsʻao assumes the name of a Minister of the empire, he is\r\nat heart a rebel. You, O General, are able in war and brave. You are\r\nthe heir to your father and brother. You command brave and tried\r\nsoldiers, and you have plentiful supplies. You are able to overrun the\r\nwhole country and rid it of every evil. There is no reason why you\r\nshould surrender to a rebel. Moreover, Tsʻao has undertaken this\r\nexpedition in defiance of all the rules of war. The north is unsubdued\r\nand Ma Tʻêng and Han Sui threaten his rear and yet he persists in his\r\nsouthern march. This is the first point against Tsʻao. The northern men\r\nare unused to fighting on the water; Tsʻao is relinquishing his\r\nwell-tried cavalry and trusting to ships. That is the second point\r\nagainst him. Again, we are now in full winter and the weather is at its\r\ncoldest so there is no food for the horses. That is the third point\r\nagainst. Soldiers from the central state marching in a wet country\r\namong lakes and rivers will find themselves in an unaccustomed climate\r\nand suffer from malaria. That is the fourth point against. Now when\r\nTsʻao’s armies have all these points against them, defeat is certain,\r\nhowever numerous they may be, and you can take Tsʻao captive just as\r\nsoon as you wish. Give me a few companies of veterans and I will go and\r\ndestroy him.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan started up from his place saying, “The rebellious old rascal\r\nhas been wanting to overthrow the Hans and set up himself for years. He\r\nhas rid himself of all those he feared, save only myself, and I swear\r\nthat one of us two shall go now. Both of us cannot live. What you say,\r\nnoble friend, is just what I think, and Heaven has certainly sent you\r\nto my assistance.”\r\n\r\n“Thy servant will fight a decisive battle,” said Chou Yü, “and shrink\r\nnot from any sacrifice. Only, General, do not hesitate.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan drew the sword that hung at his side and slashed the table\r\nin front of him, exclaiming, “Let any other man mention surrender and\r\nhe shall be served as I have served this table.”\r\n\r\nThen he handed the sword to Chou Yü, at the same time giving him a\r\ncommission as Commander-in-Chief, Chʻêng Pʻu being second in command.\r\nLu Su was also nominated as assistant.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Sun said, “With this sword you will slay any officer who\r\nmay disobey your commands.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü took the sword and turning to the assembly said, “You have\r\nheard our lord’s charge to me, to lead you to destroy Tsʻao; you will\r\nall assemble to-morrow at the river-side camp to receive my orders.\r\nShould any be late or fail, then the full rigour of military law, the\r\nseven prohibitions and the fifty-four penalties there provided, will be\r\nenforced.”\r\n\r\nHe took leave of Sun Chʻüan and left the chamber; the various officers\r\nalso went their several ways. When Chou Yü reached his own place he\r\nsent for Kʻung-ming to consult over the business in hand. He told him\r\nof the decision that had been taken and asked for a plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n“But your master has not yet made up his mind,” said Kʻung-ming. “Till\r\nhe has, no plan can be decided upon.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“In his heart he is still fearful of Tsʻao’s numbers and frets over the\r\ninequality of the two armies. You will have to explain away those\r\nnumbers and bring him to a final decision before anything can be\r\neffected.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is excellent,” said Chou Yü and he went to the palace\r\nthat night to see his master. Sun Chʻüan said, “You must have something\r\nof real importance to say if you come like this at night.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü said, “I am making my dispositions to-morrow; you have quite\r\nmade up your mind?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Sun Chʻüan, “I still feel nervous about the\r\ndisparity of numbers. Surely we are too few. That is really all I feel\r\ndoubtful about.”\r\n\r\n“It is precisely because you have this one remaining doubt that I am\r\ncome. And I will explain. Tsʻao’s letter speaks of a hundred legions of\r\nmarines, and so you feel doubts and fears and do not wait to consider\r\nthe real truth. Let us examine the case thoroughly. We find that he has\r\nof Central State soldiers, say, fifteen or sixteen legions, and many of\r\nthem are sick. He only got seven or eight legions from the Yüans and\r\nmany of those are of doubtful loyalty. Now these sick men and these men\r\nof doubtful loyalty seem a great many but they are not at all fearsome.\r\nI could smash them with five legions. So, my lord, have no further\r\nanxiety.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan patted his general on the back saying, “You have explained\r\nmy difficulty and relieved my doubts. Chang Chao is an old fool who\r\nconstantly baulks my expeditions. Only you and Lu Su have any real\r\nunderstanding of my heart. To-morrow you and he and Chʻêng Pʻu will\r\nstart and I shall have a strong reserve ready with plentiful supplies\r\nto support you. If anything goes agley you can at once send for me and\r\nI will engage with my own men.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü left; but in his innermost heart he said to himself, “If that\r\nKʻung-ming can gauge my master’s thoughts so very accurately he is too\r\nclever for me and will be a danger. He will have to be put out of the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nHe sent a messenger over to Lu Su to talk over this last scheme. When\r\nhe had laid it bare, Lu Su did not favour it. “No, no,” said he, “it is\r\nself-destruction to make away with your ablest officer before Tsʻao\r\nshall have been destroyed.”\r\n\r\n“But Kʻung-ming will certainly help Liu Pei to our disadvantage.”\r\n\r\n“Try what his brother Chuko Chin can do to persuade him. It would be an\r\nexcellent thing to have these two in our service.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” replied Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nNext morning at dawn Chou Yü went to his camp and took his seat in the\r\ncouncil tent. The lictors took up their stations right and left and the\r\nofficers ranged themselves in lines to listen to the orders.\r\n\r\nNow Chʻêng Pʻu, who was older than Chou Yü, was very angry at being\r\npassed over, so he made a pretence of indisposition and stayed away\r\nfrom this assembly. But he sent his son to represent him. Chou Yü\r\naddressed the gathering, saying, “The law knows no partiality and you\r\nwill all have to attend to your several duties. Tsʻao is now more\r\nabsolute than ever was Tung Cho, and the Emperor is really a prisoner\r\nin Hsüchʻang, guarded by the most cruel soldiers. We have a command to\r\ndestroy Tsʻao and with your willing help we shall advance. The army\r\nmust cause no hardship to the people anywhere. Rewards for good service\r\nand punishments for faults shall be given impartially.”\r\n\r\nHaving delivered this charge he told off Han Tang and Huang Kai as\r\nleaders of the van, and ordered the ships under his own command to get\r\nunder way and go to Sanchiangkʻou. They would get orders by and bye.\r\nThen he appointed five armies with two officers over each while Lü Fan\r\nand Chu Chih were appointed inspectors, to move from place to place and\r\nkeep the various units up to their work and acting with due regard to\r\nthe general plan. Land and marine forces were to move simultaneously.\r\nThe expedition would soon start.\r\n\r\nHaving received their orders each returned to his command and busied\r\nhimself in preparation. Chʻêng Pʻu’s son returned and told his father\r\nwhat arrangements had been made and Chʻêng Pʻu was amazed at their\r\nskill. Said he, “I have always despised Chou Yü as a mere student who\r\nwould never be a general, but this shows that he has a leader’s talent.\r\nI must support him.” So he went over to the quarters of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and confessed his fault. He was received kindly and\r\nall was over.\r\n\r\nNext Chou Yü sent for Chuko Chin and said to him, “Evidently your\r\nbrother is a genius, a man born to be a king’s counsellor. Why then\r\ndoes he serve Liu Pei? Now that he is here I wish you to use every\r\neffort to persuade him to stay with us. Thus our lord would gain able\r\nsupport and you two brothers would be together, which would be pleasant\r\nfor you both. I wish you success.”\r\n\r\nChin replied, “I am ashamed of the little service I have rendered since\r\nI came here and I can do no other than obey your command to the best of\r\nmy ability.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he went away to his brother, whom he found in the\r\nguest-house. The younger brother received him and when he had reached\r\nthe inner rooms Kʻung-ming bowed respectfully and, weeping, told his\r\nexperiences since they parted and his sorrow at their separation. Then\r\nChin, weeping also, said, “Brother, do you remember the story of Po I\r\nand Shu Chʻi, the brothers who would not be separated?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Chou Yü has sent him to talk me over,” thought Kʻung-ming. So he\r\nreplied, “They were two of the noble people of old days; yes, I know.”\r\n\r\n“Those two, although they perished of hunger near the Shouyang Hills,\r\nyet never separated. You and I, born of the same mother and suckled at\r\nthe same breast, yet serve different masters and never meet. Are you\r\nnot ashamed when you think of such examples as Po I and Shu Chʻi?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “You are talking now of love, but what I stand for\r\nis duty. We are both men of Han and Liu Pei is of the family. If you,\r\nbrother, could leave Wu and join me in serving the rightful branch,\r\nthen on the one side we should be honoured as Ministers of Han and on\r\nthe other we should be together as people of the same flesh and blood\r\nshould be. Thus love and duty would both receive their proper meed.\r\nWhat do you think of it, my brother?”\r\n\r\n“I came to persuade him and lo! it is I who am being talked over,”\r\nthought Chuko Chin. He had no fitting reply to make so he rose and took\r\nhis leave. Returning to Chou Yü he related the story of the interview.\r\n\r\n“What do you think?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“General Sun has treated me with great kindness and I could not turn my\r\nback on him,” replied Chin.\r\n\r\n“Since you decide to remain loyal, there is no need to say much; I\r\nthink I have a plan to win over your brother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        The wisest men see eye to eye.\r\n            For each but sees the right;\r\n        But should their several interests clash,\r\n            They all the fiercer fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe means by which Chou Yü tried to get the support of Kʻung-ming will\r\nbe described in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO LOSES SOLDIERS:\r\nCHIANG KAN VICTIM OF A RUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChou Yü was very annoyed by the words of Chuko Chin and a fierce hatred\r\nfor Kʻung-ming took root in his heart. He nourished a secret resolve to\r\nmake away with him. He continued his preparations for war and when the\r\nmen were all mustered and ready he went in for a farewell interview\r\nwith his lord.\r\n\r\n“You go on first, noble Sir,” said Sun Chʻüan. “I will then march to\r\nsupport you.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü took his leave and then, with Chʻêng Pʻu and Lu Su, marched out\r\nwith the army. He invited Kʻung-ming to accompany the expedition, and\r\nwhen he cheerfully accepted, the four embarked in the same ship. They\r\nset sail and the flotilla made for Hsiakʻou.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty li from “Three River Mouths” the fleet anchored near the\r\nshore and Chou Yü built a stockade on the bank near the middle of their\r\nline with the West Hills as a support. Other camps were made near his.\r\nKʻung-ming, however, took up his quarters in a small ship.\r\n\r\nWhen the camp dispositions were complete Chou Yü sent to request\r\nKʻung-ming to come and give him advice. He came, and after the\r\nsalutations were ended Chou Yü said, “Tsʻao Tsʻao thought he had fewer\r\ntroops than Yüan Shao, nevertheless overcame him because he followed\r\nthe advice given by Hsü Yu to destroy his supplies. Now Tsʻao Tsʻao has\r\nover eighty legions while I have but five or six. In order to defeat\r\nhim his supplies must be destroyed first. I have found out that the\r\nmain depôt is at Chütʻieh Hill. As you have lived hereabout you know\r\nthe topography quite well and I wish to entrust the task of cutting off\r\nsupplies to you and your colleagues Kuan Yü, Chang Fei and Chao Yün. I\r\nwill assist you with a company. I wish you to start without delay. In\r\nthis way we can best serve our masters.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming saw through this at once. He thought to himself, “This is a\r\nruse in revenge for my not having been persuaded to enter the service\r\nof Wu. If I refuse I shall be laughed at. So I will do as he asks and\r\ntrust to find some means of deliverance from the evil he intends.”\r\n\r\nTherefore he accepted the task with alacrity, much to the joy of Chou\r\nYü. After the leader of the expedition had taken his leave, Lu Su went\r\nto Chou Yü secretly and said, “Why have you set him this task?”\r\n\r\n“Because I wish to compass his death without appearing ridiculous. I\r\nhope to get him killed by the hand of Tsʻao Tsʻao and prevent his doing\r\nfurther mischief.”\r\n\r\nLu Su left and went to see Kʻung-ming to find out if he suspected\r\nanything. He found him looking quite unconcerned and getting the\r\nsoldiers ready to march. Unable to hold his tongue, however, he put a\r\ntentative question, “Do you think this expedition will succeed?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming laughingly replied, “I am an adept at all sorts of fighting,\r\nwith foot, horse and chariots on land and on the water. There is no\r\ndoubt of my success. I am not like you and your friend, only capable in\r\none direction.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by our being capable only in one direction?” said Lu\r\nSu.\r\n\r\n“I have heard the street boys in your country singing:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        To lay an ambush, hold a pass,\r\n          Lu Su is the man to choose;\r\n        But when you on the water fight,\r\n          Chou Yü is the man to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are only fit for ambushes and guarding passes on land, just as he\r\nonly understands fighting on the water.”\r\n\r\nLu Su carried this story to Chou Yü, which only incensed him the more\r\nagainst Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“How dare he flout me, saying I cannot fight a land battle? I will not\r\nlet him go. I will go myself with a legion and cut off Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nsupplies.”\r\n\r\nLu Su went back and told this to Kʻung-ming, who smiled and said, “He\r\nonly wanted me to go on this expedition because he wanted Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nto kill me. And so I teased him a little. But he cannot bear that. Now\r\nis the critical moment and the Marquis Wu and my master must act in\r\nharmony if we are to succeed. If each one tries to harm the other the\r\nwhole scheme will fail. Tsʻao Tsʻao is no fool and it is a usual thing\r\nwith him to attack an enemy through his supplies. Do you not think he\r\nhas already taken double precautions against any surprise of his own\r\ndepôt? If Chou Yü tries he will be taken prisoner. What he ought to do\r\nis to bring about a decisive naval battle, whereby to dishearten the\r\nnorthern men, and then find some other means to defeat them utterly. If\r\nyou could persuade him what was his best course it would be well.”\r\n\r\nWithout loss of time, Lu Su went to Chou Yü to relate what Kʻung-ming\r\nhad told him. Chou shook his head when he heard it and beat the ground\r\nwith his foot, saying, “This man is far too clever; he beats me fifty\r\nto one. He will have to be done away with or my country will suffer.”\r\n\r\nSaid Lu Su, “This is the moment to use men; you must think of the\r\ncountry’s good first of all. When once Tsʻao Tsʻao is defeated you may\r\ndo as you please.”\r\n\r\nChou had to confess the reasonableness of this.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to speak of Liu Pei. He had ordered his nephew Liu Chʻi\r\nto hold Chianghsia while he and the bulk of the army returned to\r\nHsiakʻou. Thence he saw the opposite bank thick with banners and flags\r\nand glittering with every kind of arms and armour. He knew then that\r\nthe expedition from Wu had started. So he moved all his force from\r\nChianghsia to Fankʻou.\r\n\r\nThen he assembled his officers and said to them, “Kʻung-ming went to Wu\r\nsome time ago and no word has come from him, so I know not how the\r\nbusiness stands. Will any one volunteer to go to find out?”\r\n\r\n“I will go,” said Mi Chu.\r\n\r\nSo presents were prepared and gifts of flesh and wine, and Mi Chu\r\nprepared to journey to Wu on the pretext of offering a congratulatory\r\nfeast to the army. Mi Chu set out in a small ship and went down river.\r\nHe stopped opposite the camp and the soldiers reported his arrival to\r\nChou Yü, who ordered him to be brought in. Mi Chu bowed low and\r\nexpressed the respect which Liu Pei had for Chou Yü and offered the\r\nvarious gifts. The ceremony of reception was followed by a banquet in\r\nhonour of Mi Chu. Mi said, “Kʻung-ming has been here a long time and I\r\ndesire that he may return with me.”\r\n\r\n“Kʻung-ming is making plans with me and I could not let him return,”\r\nsaid Chou Yü. “I also wish to see Liu Pei that we may make joint plans,\r\nbut when one is at the head of a great army one cannot get away even\r\nfor a moment. If your master would only come here it would be very\r\ngracious on his part.”\r\n\r\nMi Chu agreed that Liu Pei might come and presently took his leave.\r\nThen Lu Su asked Chou Yü the reason for his desiring Liu Pei to come.\r\n\r\n“Liu Yüan-tê is the one bold and dangerous man and must be removed. I\r\nam taking this opportunity to persuade him to come, and when he shall\r\nbe slain a great danger will cease to threaten our country.”\r\n\r\nLu Su tried to dissuade him from this scheme but Chou Yü was deaf to\r\nall he said. He even issued orders for half a hundred executioners to\r\nbe ready to hide within the lining of his tent if Liu Pei decided to\r\ncome and arranged to drop a cup as a signal for them to fall on and\r\nslay him.\r\n\r\nMi Chu returned and told Liu Pei that his presence was desired by Chou\r\nYü. Suspecting nothing Liu Pei at once ordered them to prepare a fast\r\nvessel to take him without loss of time. Kuan Yü was opposed to his\r\ngoing saying that Chou Yü was artful and treacherous and there was no\r\nnews from Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “I have joined my forces to theirs in this attack on\r\nour common enemy. If Chou Yü wishes to see me and I refuse to go, it is\r\na betrayal. Nothing will succeed if both sides nourish suspicions.”\r\n\r\n“If you have finally decided to go, then will I go with you,” said Kuan\r\nYü.\r\n\r\n“And I also,” cried Chang Fei.\r\n\r\nBut Yüan-tê said, “Let Kuan Yü come with me while you and Chao Yün keep\r\nguard. Chien Yung will hold Ohsien. I shall not be away long.”\r\n\r\nSo leaving these orders, Liu Pei embarked with his brother on a small\r\nboat. The escort did not exceed a score. The light craft travelled very\r\nquickly down the river. Liu Pei rejoiced greatly at the sight of the\r\nwar vessels in tiers by the bank, the soldiers in their breastplates\r\nand all the pomp and panoply of war. All was in excellent order.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he arrived the guards ran to tell Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“How many ships has he?” asked Chou.\r\n\r\nThey replied, “Only one; and the escort is only about a score.”\r\n\r\n“His fate is sealed,” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nHe sent for the executioners and placed them in hiding between the\r\nouter and inner tents, and when all was arranged for the assassination\r\nhe contemplated, he went out to receive his visitor. Liu Pei came with\r\nhis brother and escort into the midst of the army to the Commander’s\r\ntent. After the salutations Chou Yü wished Liu Pei to take the upper\r\nseat, but he declined saying, “General, you are famous through all the\r\ncountry, while I am a nobody. Do not overwhelm me with too great\r\ndeference.”\r\n\r\nSo they took the positions of simple friends and refreshments were\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\nNow by chance Kʻung-ming came on shore and heard that his master had\r\narrived and was with the Commander-in-Chief. The news gave him a great\r\nshock and he said to himself, “What is to be done now?” He made his way\r\nto the reception tent and stole a look therein. He saw murder written\r\non Chou Yü’s countenance and noted the assassins hidden within the\r\nwalls of the tent. Then he got a look at Liu Pei, who was laughing and\r\ntalking quite unconcernedly. But when he noticed the redoubtable figure\r\nof Kuan Yü near his master’s side he became quite calm and contented.\r\n\r\n“No danger,” said he, and he went away to the river bank to await the\r\nend of the interview.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the banquet of welcome proceeded. After the wine had gone\r\naround several times Chou Yü picked up a cup to give the signal agreed\r\nupon. But at that moment he saw so fierce a look upon the face of the\r\ntrusty henchman who stood, sword in hand, behind his guest, that he\r\nhesitated and hastily asked who he was.\r\n\r\n“That is my brother, Kuan Yün-chʻang,” replied Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nChou Yü, quite startled, said, “Is he the slayer of Yen Liang and Wên\r\nChʻou?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; he it is,” replied Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nThe sweat of fear broke out all over Chou Yü’s body and trickled down\r\nhis back. Then he poured out a cup of wine and presented it to Kuan Yü.\r\nJust then Lu Su came in and Yüan-tê said to him, “Where is Kʻung-ming?\r\nI would trouble you to ask him to come.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till we have defeated Tsʻao Tsʻao,” said Chou Yü, “then you shall\r\nsee him.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê dared not repeat his request, but Kuan Yü gave him a meaning\r\nlook which Yüan-tê understood and rose, saying, “I would take leave\r\nnow; I will come again to congratulate you when the enemy has been\r\ndefeated and your success shall be complete.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü did not press him to remain, but escorted him to the great\r\ngates of the camp, and Yüan-tê left. When he reached the river bank\r\nthey found Kʻung-ming awaiting them in their boat.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was exceedingly pleased but Kʻung-ming said, “Sir, do you know\r\nin how great danger you were to-day?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly sobered, Yüan-tê said, “No; I did not think of danger.”\r\n\r\n“If Yün-chʻang had not been there you would have been killed,” said\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê, after a moment’s reflection, saw that it was true. He begged\r\nKʻung-ming to return with him to Fanchʻêng, but he refused. “I am quite\r\nsafe,” said he. “Although I am living in the tiger’s mouth, I am as\r\nsteady as Mount Tʻai. Now, my lord, return and prepare your ships and\r\nmen. On the twentieth day of the eleventh month send Chao Yün with a\r\nsmall ship to the south bank to wait for me. Be sure there is no\r\nmiscarriage.”\r\n\r\n“What are your intentions?” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“When the south-east wind begins I shall have to return.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê would have questioned him further, but Kʻung-ming pressed him\r\nto go. So the boat started up river again while Kʻung-ming returned to\r\nhis temporary lodging.\r\n\r\nThe boat had not proceeded far when appeared a small fleet sweeping\r\ndown with the current, and in the prow of the leading vessel stood a\r\ntall figure armed with a spear. It was Chang Fei, who had come down\r\nfearing lest his brother might be in some difficulty from which the\r\nstrong arm of Kuan Yü might even be insufficient to rescue him.\r\n\r\nOf the return of the three brothers nothing will be said. After Chou\r\nYü, having escorted Yüan-tê to the gate of his camp, had returned to\r\nhis quarters Lu Su soon came to see him.\r\n\r\n“When you had cajoled Yüan-tê into coming, why did you not carry out\r\nyour plan?” asked Lu.\r\n\r\n“Because of that Kuan Yü; he is a very tiger and he never left his\r\nbrother for a moment. If anything had been attempted he would certainly\r\nhave had my life.”\r\n\r\nLu Su knew that he spoke the truth. Then suddenly they announced a\r\nmessenger with a letter from Tsʻao Tsʻao. Chou Yü ordered them to bring\r\nhim in and took the letter. But when he saw the superscription “The\r\nFirst Minister of Han to Commander-in-Chief Chou,” he fell into a\r\nfrenzy of rage, tore the letter to fragments and threw them on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“To death with this fellow!” cried he.\r\n\r\n“When two countries are at war their emissaries are not slain,” said\r\nLu.\r\n\r\n“Messengers are slain to show one’s dignity and independence,” replied\r\nChou.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy bearer of the letter was decapitated and his head sent back\r\nto Tsʻao Tsʻao by the hands of his escort.\r\n\r\nChou Yü then decided to move. The van under Kan Ning was to advance,\r\nsupported by two wings. Chou Yü would lead the remainder in support.\r\nThe next morning the early meal was eaten in the fourth watch and the\r\nships got under weigh in the fifth with a great beating of drums.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was greatly angered when he heard that his letter had been\r\ntorn to fragments and he resolved to attack forthwith. His advance was\r\nled by Tsʻai Mao and others of the Chingchou officers who had joined\r\nhis side. He went as hastily as possible to the meeting of the three\r\nrivers and saw the ships of Wu sailing up. In the bow of the foremost\r\nship stood a fine figure of a warrior who cried, “I am Kan Ning; I\r\nchallenge any one to combat.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao sent his young brother to accept the challenge, but as his\r\nship approached Kan Ning shot an arrow and Tsʻai Hsün fell. Kan Ning\r\npressed forward, his crossbowmen keeping up a heavy discharge which\r\nTsʻao’s men could not stand. The wings also joined in.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s men, being mostly from the dry plains of the north, did not\r\nknow how to fight effectually on water and the southern ships had the\r\nbattle all their own way. The slaughter was very great. However, after\r\na contest lasting till afternoon Chou Yü thought it more prudent, in\r\nview of the superior numbers of his enemy, not to risk further the\r\nadvantage he had gained. So he beat the gongs as the signal to cease\r\nbattle and recall the ships.\r\n\r\nTsʻao was worsted, but his ships returned to the bank, where a camp was\r\nmade and order was restored. Tsʻao sent for his defeated leaders and\r\nreproached them saying, “You did not do your best. You let an inferior\r\nforce overcome you.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao defended himself saying, “The Chingchou marines have not been\r\nexercised for a long time and the others have never been trained for\r\nnaval warfare at all. A naval camp must be instituted, the northern men\r\ntrained and the Chingchou men drilled. When they have been made\r\nefficient they will win victories.”\r\n\r\n“If you know what should be done, why have you not done it?” said Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao. “What is the use of telling me this? Get to work.”\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻai Mao and Chang Yün organised a naval camp on the river bank.\r\nThey established twenty-four “Water Gates,” with the large ships\r\noutside as a sort of rampart, and under their protection the smaller\r\nships went to and fro freely. At night when the lanterns and torches\r\nwere lit the very sky was illuminated and the water shone red with the\r\nglare. On land the smoke of the camp fires could be traced for three\r\nhundred li without a break.\r\n\r\nChou Yü returned to camp and feasted his victorious fighting men. A\r\nmessenger bore the joyful tidings of victory to his master in Wu. When\r\nnight fell Chou Yü went up to the summit of one of the hills and looked\r\nout over the long line of bright lights stretching toward the west,\r\nshowing the extent of the enemy’s camp. He said nothing, but a great\r\nfear came in upon him.\r\n\r\nNext day Chou Yü decided that he would go in person to find out the\r\nstrength of the enemy. So he bade them prepare a small squadron which\r\nhe manned with strong, hardy men armed with powerful bows and stiff\r\ncrossbows. He also placed musicians on each ship. They set sail and\r\nstarted up the stream. When they got opposite Tsʻao Tsʻao’s camp the\r\nheavy stones that served as anchors were dropped and the drums and\r\ntrumpets began while Chou Yü scanned the enemy’s naval camp. What he\r\nsaw gave him no satisfaction for everything was most admirable. He\r\nenquired whether any one knew the names of the admirals and they told\r\nhim Tsʻai Mao and Chang Yün.\r\n\r\n“They have lived in our country a long time,” said he, “and are\r\nthoroughly experienced in naval warfare. I must find some means of\r\nremoving them before I can effect anything.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on shore the sentinels had told Tsʻao that the enemy craft\r\nwere spying upon them and he ordered out some ships to capture the\r\nspies. Chou Yü saw the commotion on shore and hastily gave the order to\r\nunmoor and sail down stream. The squadron at once got under way and\r\nscattered; to and fro went the oars and each ship seemed to fly. Before\r\nTsʻao’s ships could get out after them they were all far away. Tsʻao’s\r\nships took up the chase but soon saw pursuit was useless. They returned\r\nand reported their failure.\r\n\r\nAgain Tsʻao found fault with his officers and said, “The other day you\r\nlost a battle and the soldiers were greatly dispirited. Now the enemy\r\nhave spied out our camp. What can be done?”\r\n\r\nIn eager response to his question one stepped out, saying, “When I was\r\na youth Chou Yü and I were fellow students and pledged friends. My\r\nthree-inch tongue is still good and I will go over and persuade him to\r\nsurrender.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao, rejoiced to find so speedy a solution, looked at the speaker. It\r\nwas Chiang Kan of Kiukiang, one of the secretary staff in the camp.\r\n\r\n“Are you a good friend of Chou Yü’s?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Rest contented, O Minister,” replied Kan. “If I only get on the other\r\nside of the river I shall succeed.”\r\n\r\n“What preparations are necessary?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Just a youth as my servant and a couple of rowers; nothing else.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao offered him wine, wished him success and sent him on his way.\r\n\r\nClad in a simple white robe and seated in his little craft, the\r\nmessenger reached Chou Yü’s camp and bade the men say that an old\r\nfriend Chiang Kan wished to see him. The commander was in his tent at a\r\ncouncil when the message came, and he laughed as he said to those about\r\nhim, “A guest is coming.” Then he whispered certain instructions in the\r\near of each one of them and they went out to await his arrival.\r\n\r\nChou Yü received his friend in full ceremonial garb. A crowd of\r\nofficers in rich silken robes were about him. The guest appeared, his\r\nsole attendant a lad dressed in a simple blue gown. He bore himself\r\nproudly as he advanced and Chou Yü made a low obeisance.\r\n\r\n“You have been well I hope since last we met,” said Chiang Kan.\r\n\r\n“You have wandered far and suffered much in this task of emissary in\r\nthe Tsʻao cause,” said Chou.\r\n\r\n“I have not seen you for a very long time,” said the envoy much taken\r\naback, “and I came to visit you for the sake of old times. Why do you\r\ncall me an emissary for the Tsʻao cause?”\r\n\r\n“Though I am not so clever a musician as Shih Kuang, yet I can\r\ncomprehend the thought behind the music,” replied Chou.\r\n\r\n“As you choose to treat your old friend like this I think I will take\r\nmy leave,” said Chiang.\r\n\r\nChou Yü laughed again and taking Kan by the arm, said, “Well, I feared\r\nyou might be coming on his behalf to try to persuade me. But if this is\r\nnot your intention, you need not go away so hastily.”\r\n\r\nSo they two entered the tent; and when they had exchanged salutes and\r\nwere seated as friends, Chou Yü bade them call his officers that he\r\nmight introduce them. They soon appeared civil and military officials,\r\nall dressed in their best. The military officers were clad in\r\nglittering silver armour and the staff looked very imposing as they\r\nstood ranged in two lines.\r\n\r\nThe visitor was introduced to them all. Presently a banquet was spread,\r\nand while they feasted the musicians played songs of victory and the\r\nwine circulated merrily. Under its mellowing influence Chou Yü’s\r\nreserve seemed to thaw and he said, “He is an old fellow student of\r\nmine and we are pledged friends. Though he has arrived here from the\r\nnorth he is no artful pleader so you need not be afraid of him.”\r\n\r\nThen he took off the sword which he wore as Commander-in-Chief and\r\nhanded it to Tʻaishih Tzŭ, saying, “You take this and wear it for the\r\nday as master of the feast. This day we meet only as friends and if any\r\none shall begin a discussion of the questions at issue between Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao and our country just slay him.”\r\n\r\nTʻaishih Tzŭ took the sword and seated himself in his place. The guest\r\nwas not a little overcome, but he said no word.\r\n\r\nChou Yü said, “Since I assumed command I have tasted no drop of wine,\r\nbut to-day as an old friend is present and there is no reason to fear\r\nhim, I am going to drink freely.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he quaffed a huge goblet and laughed loudly.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros cups went swiftly round from guest to guest till all\r\nwere half drunk. Then Chou Yü, laying hold of the guest’s hand, led him\r\noutside the tent. The guards who stood around all braced themselves up\r\nand seized their weapons.\r\n\r\n“Do you not think my soldiers a fine lot of fellows?” said Chou.\r\n\r\n“Strong as bears and bold as tigers,” replied Chiang Kan.\r\n\r\nThen Chou Yü led him to the rear of the tent whence he saw the grain\r\nand forage piled up in mountainous heaps.\r\n\r\n“Do you not think I have a fairly good store of grain and forage?”\r\n\r\n“It is quite true as I have heard that your men are brave and your\r\nsupplies ample.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü pretended to be quite intoxicated and went on, “When you and I\r\nwere students together, we never looked forward to a day like this did\r\nwe?”\r\n\r\n“For a genius like you it is nothing extraordinary,” said the guest.\r\n\r\nChou Yü again seized his hand and they sat down. “When a really great\r\nman has found his proper lord then, in his service, he relies upon the\r\nright feeling between prince and minister outside, and at home he is\r\nfirm in the kindly feeling of relatives. His words must be obeyed, his\r\nplans must be followed out. He is independent of good or evil fortune.\r\nHe takes as his models such men as Su Chʻin, Chang I, Lu Chia and Li\r\nShêng so that they seem to live again. His words pour forth like a\r\nrushing river, his tongue is as a sharp sword. Is it possible to move\r\nsuch as I am?”\r\n\r\nHe burst into a loud laugh as he finished and Chiang Kan’s face had\r\nbecome clay-coloured. Chou Yü then led his guest back into the tent and\r\nagain they fell to drinking. Presently he pointed to the others at\r\ntable and said, “These are all the best and bravest of the land of Wu;\r\none might call this ‘The Meeting of Heroes’.”\r\n\r\nThey drank on till daylight failed and continued after lamps had been\r\nlit. Chou Yü even gave an exhibition of sword play and sang this song:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        When a man is in the world, O,\r\n          He ought to do his best.\r\n        And when he’s done his best, O,\r\n          He ought to have his rest.\r\n        And when I have my rest, O,\r\n          I’ll quaff my wine with zest.\r\n        And when I’m drunk as drunk can be,\r\n          I’ll sing the madman’s litany.\r\n\r\n\r\nA burst of applause greeted the song. By this time it was getting late\r\nand the guest begged to be excused. “The wine is too much for me,” said\r\nhe. His host bade them clear the table and as all the others left Chou\r\nYü said, “It is many a day since I shared a couch with my friend, but\r\nwe will do so to-night.”\r\n\r\nPutting on the appearance of irresponsible intoxication he led Chiang\r\nKan into the tent and they went to bed. Chou Yü simply fell, all\r\ndressed as he was, and lay there emitting uncouth grunts and groans, so\r\nthat to the guest sleep was impossible. He lay and listened to the\r\nvarious camp noises without and his host’s thund’rous snores within.\r\nAbout the second watch he rose and looked at his friend by the dim\r\nlight of the small lamp. He also saw on the table a heap of papers and\r\nlooking at them furtively, saw they were letters. Among them he saw one\r\nmarked as coming from Chang Yün and Tsʻai Mao. He read it and this is\r\nwhat it said:—“We surrendered to Tsʻao Tsʻao, not for the sake of pay\r\nbut under stress of circumstances. Now we have fooled these northern\r\nsoldiers into admitting us to their camp but, as soon as occasion\r\noffers, we mean to have the rebel’s head to offer as a sacrifice to\r\nyour banner. From time to time there will be reports as occasions serve\r\nbut you may trust us. This is our humble reply to your letter.”\r\n\r\n“Those two were connected with Wu in the beginning,” thought Chiang\r\nKan, so he secreted the letter in his dress and began to examine the\r\nothers. But at that moment Chou Yü turned over and so Kan hastily blew\r\nout the light and went to his couch.\r\n\r\nChou Yü was muttering as he lay there and his guest, carefully\r\nlistening, made out, “Friend, I am going to let you see Tsʻao’s head in\r\na day or two.”\r\n\r\nChiang Kan hastily made some reply to lead on his host to say more.\r\nThen came, “Wait a few days; you will see Tsʻao’s head. The old\r\nwretch!”\r\n\r\nChiang tried to question him as to what he meant, but Chou Yü was fast\r\nasleep and seemed to hear nothing. Chiang lay there on his couch wide\r\nawake till the fourth watch was beating. Then some one came in, saying,\r\n“General, are you awake?” At that moment as if suddenly awakened from\r\nthe deepest slumber, Chou Yü started up and said, “Who is this on the\r\ncouch?”\r\n\r\nThe voice replied, “Do you not remember, General? You asked your old\r\nfriend to stay the night with you; it is he, of course.”\r\n\r\n“I drank too much last night,” said Chou Yü in a regretful tone, “and I\r\nforgot. I seldom indulge to excess and am not used to it. Perhaps I\r\nsaid many things I ought not.”\r\n\r\nThe voice went on, “A man has arrived from the north.”\r\n\r\n“Speak lower,” said Chou Yü, and turning toward the sleeper he called\r\nhim by name. But Chiang Kan affected to be sound asleep and made no\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nChou Yü crept out of the tent, while Kan listened with all his ears. He\r\nheard the man say, “Chang and Tsʻai, the two commanders, have come.”\r\n\r\nBut listening as he did with straining ears he could not make out what\r\nfollowed. Soon after Chou Yü re-entered and again called out his\r\ncompanion’s name. But no reply came, for Chiang Kan was pretending to\r\nbe in the deepest slumber and to hear nothing. Then Chou Yü undressed\r\nand went to bed.\r\n\r\nAs Chiang Kan lay awake he remembered that Chou Yü was known to be\r\nmeticulously careful in affairs and if in the morning he found that a\r\nletter had disappeared he would certainly slay the offender. So he lay\r\nthere till near daylight and then called out to his host. Getting no\r\nreply he rose, dressed and stole out of the tent. Then he called his\r\nservant and made for the camp gate.\r\n\r\n“Whither are you going, Sir?” said the watchmen at the gate.\r\n\r\n“I fear I am in the way here,” replied Kan, “and so I have taken leave\r\nof the General for a time. So do not stop me.”\r\n\r\nHe found his way to the river bank and re-embarked. Then, with flying\r\noars, he hastened back to Tsʻao’s camp. When he arrived Tsʻao asked at\r\nonce how he had sped and he had to acknowledge failure.\r\n\r\n“Chou Yü is very clever and perfectly high-minded,” said he, “nothing\r\nthat I could say moved him in the least.”\r\n\r\n“Your failure makes me look ridiculous,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Well, if I did not win over Chou Yü, I found out something for you.\r\nSend away these people and I will tell you,” said Chiang.\r\n\r\nThe servants were dismissed and then Chiang Kan produced the letter he\r\nhad stolen from Chou Yü’s tent. He gave it to Tsʻao. Tsʻao was very\r\nangry and sent for the two at once. As soon as they appeared he said,\r\n“I want you two to attack.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Mao replied, “But the men are not yet sufficiently trained.”\r\n\r\n“The men will be well enough trained when you have sent my head to Chou\r\nYü, eh?”\r\n\r\nBoth officers were dumb-founded, having not the least idea what this\r\nmeant. They remained silent for they had nothing to say. Tsʻao bade the\r\nexecutioners lead them away to instant death. In a short time their\r\nheads were produced.\r\n\r\nBy this time Tsʻao had thought over the matter and it dawned upon him\r\nthat he had been tricked. A poem says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        No one could stand against Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\n          Of sin he had full share,\r\n        But Chou Yü was more treacherous,\r\n          And caught him in a snare.\r\n        Two officers to save their lives,\r\n          Betrayed a former lord,\r\n        Soon after, as was very meet,\r\n          Both fell beneath the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of these two naval commanders caused much consternation in\r\nthe camp and all their colleagues asked the reason for their sudden\r\nexecution. Though Tsʻao knew he had been victimised he would not\r\nacknowledge it. So he said the two men had been remiss and so had been\r\nput to death. The others were aghast, but nothing could be done. Two\r\nother officers, Mao and Yü by name, were put in command of the naval\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nSpies took the news to Chou Yü, who was delighted at the success of his\r\nruse.\r\n\r\n“Those two were my only source of anxiety,” said he. “Now they are\r\ngone, I am quite happy.”\r\n\r\nLu Su said, “General, if you can continue like this you need not fear\r\nTsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think any of them saw my game,” said Chou Yü, “except Chuko\r\nLiang. He beats me, and I do not think this ruse was hidden from him.\r\nYou go and sound him. See if he knew.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Chou’s treacherous plot succeeded well,\r\n        Dissension sown, his rivals fell.\r\n        Drunk with success was he, but sought\r\n        To know what cynic Kʻung-ming thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat passed between Lu Su and Kʻung-ming will next be related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nKʻUNG-MING “BORROWS” SOME ARROWS:\r\nHUANG KAI ACCEPTS A PUNISHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gossip Lu Su departed on his mission and found Kʻung-ming seated in\r\nhis little craft.\r\n\r\n“There has been so much to do that I have not been able to come to\r\nlisten to your instruction,” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“That is truly so,” said Kʻung-ming, “and I have not yet congratulated\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief.”\r\n\r\n“What have you wished to congratulate him upon?”\r\n\r\n“Why Sir, the matter upon which he sent you to find out whether I knew\r\nabout it or not. Indeed I can congratulate him on that.”\r\n\r\nLu Su turned pale and gasped. “But how did you know, Master?”\r\n\r\n“The ruse succeeded well thus played off on Chiang Kan. Tsʻao has been\r\ntaken in this once, but he will soon rise to it. Only he will not\r\nconfess his mistake. However, the two men are gone and your country is\r\nfreed from a grave anxiety. Do you not think that a matter for\r\ncongratulation? I hear Mao Chieh and Yü Chin are the new admirals, and\r\nin their hands lie both good and evil for the fate of the fleet.”\r\n\r\nLu Su was quite dumbfounded; he stayed a little time longer passing the\r\ntime in making empty remarks, and then took his leave. As he was going\r\naway Kʻung-ming cautioned him against letting Chou Yü know that his new\r\nrival had guessed his ruse. “I know he is jealous and he only seeks\r\nsome chance to do me harm.”\r\n\r\nLu Su promised; nevertheless he went straight to his chief and related\r\nthe whole thing just as it happened.\r\n\r\n“Really he must be got rid of,” said Chou Yü, “I have quite decided to\r\nput the man out of the way.”\r\n\r\n“If you slay him, will not Tsʻao Tsʻao laugh at you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; I will find a legitimate way of getting rid of him so that he\r\nshall go to his death without resentment.”\r\n\r\n“But how can you find a legitimate way of assassinating him?”\r\n\r\n“Do not ask too much; you will see presently.”\r\n\r\nSoon after all the officers were summoned to the main tent and\r\nKʻung-ming’s presence was desired. He went contentedly enough. When all\r\nwere seated Chou Yü suddenly addressed Kʻung-ming, saying, “I am going\r\nto fight a battle with the enemy soon on the water: what weapons are\r\nthe best?”\r\n\r\n“On the great river arrows are the best,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“Your opinion and mine agree. But at the moment we are short of them. I\r\nwish you would undertake to supply about a hundred thousand for the\r\nnaval fight. As it is for the public service you will not decline, I\r\nhope!”\r\n\r\n“Whatever task the Commander-in-Chief lays upon me I must certainly try\r\nto perform,” replied Kʻung-ming. “May I enquire by what date you\r\nrequire the hundred thousand arrows?”\r\n\r\n“Could you have them ready in ten days?”\r\n\r\n“The enemy will be here very soon; ten days will be too late,” said\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“In how many days do you estimate the arrows can be ready?”\r\n\r\n“Let me have three days; then you may send for your hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\n“No joking, remember,” said the General. “There is no joking in war\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Dare I joke with the Commander-in-Chief? Give me a formal military\r\norder and if I have not completed the task in three days I will take my\r\npunishment.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü, secretly delighted, sent for the secretaries and prepared the\r\ncommission then and there. Then he drank to the success of the\r\nundertaking and said, “I shall have to congratulate you most heartily\r\nwhen this is accomplished.”\r\n\r\n“This day is not to count,” said Kʻung-ming. “On the third from\r\nto-morrow morning send five hundred small boats to the river side to\r\nconvey the arrows.”\r\n\r\nThey drank a few more cups together and then Kʻung-ming took his leave.\r\nAfter he had gone, Lu Su said, “Do you not think there is some deceit\r\nabout this?”\r\n\r\n“I think he has signed his own death warrant,” said Chou. “Without\r\nbeing pressed in the least he asked for a formal order in the face of\r\nthe whole assembly. If he grew a pair of wings he could not escape.\r\nOnly I will just order the workmen to delay him as much as they can,\r\nand not supply him with materials, so that he is sure to fail. And\r\nthen, when the certain penalty is incurred, who can criticise? You can\r\ngo and enquire about it all and keep me informed.”\r\n\r\nSo off went Lu Su to seek Kʻung-ming, who at once reproached him with\r\nhaving blabbed about the former business, “He wants to hurt me, as you\r\nknow, and I did not think you could not keep my secret. And now there\r\nis what you saw to-day and how do you think I can get a hundred\r\nthousand arrows made in three days? You will simply have to rescue me.”\r\n\r\n“You brought the misfortune on yourself and how can I rescue you?” said\r\nLu.\r\n\r\n“I look to you for the loan of a score of vessels, manned each by\r\nthirty men. I want blue cotton screens and bundles of straw lashed to\r\nthe sides of the boats. I have good use for them. On the third day I\r\nhave undertaken to deliver the fixed number of arrows. But on no\r\naccount must you let Chou Yü know, or my scheme will be wrecked.”\r\n\r\nLu Su consented and this time he kept his word. He went to report to\r\nhis chief as usual, but he said nothing about the boats. He only said\r\nKʻung-ming was not using bamboo or feathers or glue or varnish, but had\r\nsome other way of getting arrows.\r\n\r\n“Let us await the three days’ limit,” said Chou Yü, puzzled though\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nOn his side Lu Su quietly prepared a score of light swift boats, each\r\nwith its crew and the blue screens and bundles of grass complete and,\r\nwhen these were ready, he placed them at Kʻung-ming’s disposal. His\r\nfriend did nothing on the first day, nor on the second. On the third\r\nday at the middle of the fourth watch, Kʻung-ming sent a private\r\nmessage asking Lu Su to come to his boat.\r\n\r\n“Why have you sent for me, Sir?” asked Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“I want you to go with me to get those arrows.”\r\n\r\n“Whither are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Do not ask: you will see.”\r\n\r\nThen the twenty boats were fastened together by long ropes and moved\r\nover to the north bank. The night proved very foggy and the mist was\r\nvery dense along the river, so that one man could scarcely see another.\r\nIn spite of the fog Kʻung-ming urged the boats forward.\r\n\r\nThere is a poem on these river fogs:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mighty indeed is the Yangtse River!\r\n    Rising far in the west, in the mountains of Omei and Min,\r\n    Ploughing its way through Wu, east flowing, resistless,\r\n    Swelled by its nine tributary streams, rolling down from the far\r\n                                                                 north,\r\n    Aided and helped by a hundred rivulets swirling and foaming,\r\n    Ocean receives it at last welcoming, joyful, its waters.\r\n    Therein abide sea-nymphs and water gods,\r\n    Enormous whales a thousand fathoms long,\r\n    Nine-headed monstrous beasts yclept tʻien-wu,\r\n    Demons and uncouth creatures wondrous strange.\r\n    In faith it is the home and safe retreat\r\n    Of devils black, and sprites, and wondrous growths,\r\n    And eke the battle ground of valiant men.\r\n    At times occur strange strife of elements,\r\n    When darkness strives on light’s domain t’encroach,\r\n    Whereat arises in the vaulted dome of blue\r\n    White wreaths of fog that toward the centre roll.\r\n    Then darkness falls, too dense for any torch\r\n    T’illumine; only clanging sounds can pass.\r\n    The fog at first appears, a vaprous wreath\r\n    Scarce visible. But thickening fast, it veils\r\n    The southern hills, the painted leopard’s home.\r\n    And spreads afar, until the northern sea\r\n    Leviathans are mazed and lose their course.\r\n    And denser yet it touches on the sky,\r\n    And spreads a heavy mantle o’er the earth.\r\n    Then, wide as is the high pitched arch of heaven,\r\n    Therein appears no single rift of blue.\r\n    Now mighty whales lead up their wives to sport\r\n    Upon the waves, the sinuous dragons dive\r\n    Deep down and, breathing, swell the heaving sea,\r\n    The earth is moist as with the early rains,\r\n    And spring’s creative energy is chilled.\r\n    Both far and wide and high the damp fog spreads,\r\n    Great cities on the eastern bank are hid,\r\n    Wide ports and mountains in the south are lost,\r\n    Whole fleets of battle ships, a thousand keels,\r\n    Hide in the misty depths; frail fishing boats\r\n    High riding on a wave are seen—and lost.\r\n    The gloom increases and the domed sky\r\n    Grows dark and darker as the sun’s light fails.\r\n    The daylight dies, dim twilight’s reign begins,\r\n    The ruddy hills dissolve and lose their hue.\r\n    The skill of matchless Yü would fail to sound\r\n    The depth and height; and Li Lou’s eye, though keen,\r\n    Could never pierce this gloom. Now is the time,\r\n    O sea and river gods, to use your powers.\r\n    The gliding fish and creeping water folk\r\n    Are lost; there is no track for bird or beast.\r\n    Fair Pʻênglai Isles are hidden from our sight,\r\n    The lofty gates of heaven have disappeared.\r\n    Nature is blurred and indistinct, as when\r\n    A driving rain storm hurries o’er the earth.\r\n    And then, perhaps, within the heavy haze\r\n    A noisome serpent vents his venom foul\r\n    And plagues descend, or impish demons work\r\n    Their wicked wills.\r\n    Ills fall on men but do not stay,\r\n    Heaven’s cleansing breath sweeps them away,\r\n    But while they last the mean ones cry,\r\n    The nobler suffer silently.\r\n    The greatest turmoil is a sign\r\n    Of quick return to state benign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little fleet reached Tsʻao Tsʻao’s naval camp about the fifth watch\r\nand orders were given to form line lying prows west, and then to beat\r\nthe drums and shout.\r\n\r\n“But what shall we do if they attack us?” exclaimed Lu Su.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied with a smile, “I think the fleet will not venture\r\nout in this fog; go on with your wine and let us be happy. We will go\r\nback when the fog lifts.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the shouting from the river was heard by those in the camp\r\nthe two commanders ran off to report to their chief, who said, “Coming\r\nup in a fog like this means that they have prepared an ambush for us.\r\nDo not go out, but get all the force together and shoot at them.”\r\n\r\nHe also sent orders to the soldier camps to despatch six companies of\r\narchers and crossbowmen to aid the marines.\r\n\r\nThe naval forces were then lined up on the bank to prevent a landing.\r\nPresently the soldiers arrived and a legion and more men were shooting\r\ndown into the river, where the arrows fell like rain. By and bye\r\nKʻung-ming ordered the boats to turn round so that their prows pointed\r\neast and to go closer in so that many arrows might hit them.\r\n\r\nThe drums were kept beating till the sun was high and the fog began to\r\ndisperse, when the boats got under way and sailed down stream. The\r\nwhole twenty boats were bristling with arrows on both sides. As they\r\nleft, all the crews derisively shouted, “We thank you, Sir Minister,\r\nfor the arrows.”\r\n\r\nThey told Tsʻao Tsʻao, but by the time he came the light boats helped\r\nby the swift current were a long way down river and pursuit was\r\nimpossible. Tsʻao Tsʻao saw that he had been duped and was very sorry,\r\nbut there was no help for it.\r\n\r\nOn the way down Kʻung-ming said to his companion, “Every boat must have\r\nfive or six thousand arrows and so, without the expenditure of an ounce\r\nof energy, we must have more than ten myriad arrows, which to-morrow\r\ncan be shot back again at Tsʻao Tsʻao’s army to his great\r\ninconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“You are really superhuman,” said Lu Su. “But how did you know there\r\nwould be a thick fog to-day?”\r\n\r\n“One cannot be a leader without knowing the workings of heaven and the\r\nways of earth. One must understand the secret gates and the\r\ninterdependence of the elements, the mysteries of tactics and the value\r\nof forces. It is but an ordinary talent. I calculated three days ago\r\nthat there would be a fog to-day and so I set the limit at three days.\r\nChou Yü would give me ten days, but neither artificers nor material, so\r\nthat he might find occasion to put me to death as I knew, but my fate\r\nlies with the Supreme and how could Chou Yü harm me?”\r\n\r\nLu Su could not but agree. When the boats arrived half a company were\r\nin readiness on the bank to carry away the arrows. Kʻung-ming bade them\r\ngo on board the boats, collect them and bear them to the tent of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. Lu Su went to report that the arrows had been\r\nobtained and told Chou Yü by what means.\r\n\r\nChou Yü was amazed and sighed sadly, saying, “He is better than I; his\r\nmethods are more than human.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Thick lies the fog on the river,\r\n            Nature is shrouded in white,\r\n        Distant and near are confounded,\r\n            Banks are no longer in sight.\r\n        Fast fly the pattering arrows,\r\n            Stick in the boats of the fleet.\r\n        Now can full tale be delivered,\r\n            Kʻung-ming is victor complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, shortly after his return, Kʻung-ming went to the tent of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief he was welcomed by Chou Yü, who came forward to\r\ngreet him, saying, “Your superhuman predictions compel one’s esteem.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing remarkable in that trifling trick,” replied he.\r\n\r\nChou Yü led him within and wine was brought.\r\n\r\nChou Yü said, “My lord sent yesterday to urge me to advance, but I have\r\nno master plan ready; I wish you would assist me, Master.”\r\n\r\n“But where should I, a man of poor, everyday ability, find such a plan\r\nas you desire?”\r\n\r\n“I saw the enemy’s naval camp just lately and it looked very complete\r\nand well organised. It is not an ordinary place to attack. I have\r\nthought of a plan, but I am not sure it will answer. I should be happy\r\nif you would decide for me.”\r\n\r\n“General,” replied Kʻung-ming, “do not say what your plan is but each\r\nof us will write in the palm of his hand and see whether our opinions\r\nagree.”\r\n\r\nSo pen and ink were sent for and Chou Yü first wrote on his own palm,\r\nand then passed the pen to Kʻung-ming who also wrote. Then getting\r\nclose together on the same bench each showed his hand to the other, and\r\nboth burst out laughing, for both had written the same word, “Fire.”\r\n\r\n“Since we are of the same opinion,” said Chou Yü, “there is no longer\r\nany doubt. But our intentions must be kept secret.”\r\n\r\n“Both of us are public servants and what would be the sense of telling\r\nour plans? I do not think Tsʻao Tsʻao will be on his guard against this\r\nalthough he has had two experiences. You may put your scheme into\r\nforce.”\r\n\r\nThey finished their wine and separated. Not an officer knew a word of\r\nthe general’s plans.\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao Tsʻao had expended a myriad arrows in vain and was much\r\nirritated in consequence. He deeply desired revenge. Then Hsün Yu\r\nproposed a ruse, saying, “The two strategists on the side of the enemy\r\nare Chou Yü and Chuko Liang, two men most difficult to get the better\r\nof. Let us send some one who shall pretend to surrender to them but\r\nreally be a spy on our behalf and a helper in our schemes. When we know\r\nwhat is doing we can plan to meet it.”\r\n\r\n“I had thought of that myself,” replied Tsʻao. “Whom do you think the\r\nbest man to send?”\r\n\r\n“Tsʻai Mao has been put to death, but all the clan and family are in\r\nthe army and the two younger brothers are junior generals. You have\r\nthem most securely in your power and may send them to surrender. The\r\nruler of Wu will never suspect deceit there.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao decided to act on this plan and in the evening summoned the\r\ntwo men to his tent, where he told them what he wished them to do. And\r\nhe promised them rich rewards if they succeeded. “But do not betray\r\nme,” added he.\r\n\r\n“Our families are in Chingchou and that place is yours,” replied they.\r\n“Should we dare betray? You need have no doubts, Sir. You will soon see\r\nthe heads of both Chou Yü and Chuko Liang at your feet.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao gave them generous gifts and soon after the two men, each\r\nwith his half company, set sail with a fair wind for the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nNow as Chou Yü was preparing for the attack the arrival of some ships\r\nwas announced. They bore the two younger brothers of Tsʻai Mao, who had\r\ncome as deserters. They were led in and, bowing before the general,\r\nsaid, weeping, “Our innocent brother has been put to death and we\r\ndesire vengeance. So we have come to offer allegiance to you. We pray\r\nyou to appoint us to the vanguard.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü appeared very pleased and made them presents. Then he ordered\r\nthem to join Kan Ning in leading the van. They thanked him and regarded\r\ntheir scheme as already a success.\r\n\r\nBut he gave Kan Ning secret orders, saying, “They have come without\r\ntheir families and so I know their desertion is only pretence. They\r\nhave been sent as spies and I am going to meet their ruse with one of\r\nmy own. They shall have some information to send. You will treat them\r\nwell, but keep a careful guard over them. On the day our soldiers start\r\nthey shall be sacrificed to the flag. But be very careful that nothing\r\ngoes wrong.”\r\n\r\nKan Ning went away, and Lu Su came in to tell Chou Yü that every one\r\nagreed in thinking the surrender of the two feigned and said they\r\nshould be rejected.\r\n\r\n“But they wish to revenge the death of their brother,” said the\r\nGeneral. “Where is the pretence? If you are so suspicious you will\r\nreceive nobody at all.”\r\n\r\nLu Su left much piqued and went to see Kʻung-ming to whom he told the\r\nstory. Kʻung-ming only smiled.\r\n\r\n“Why do you smile?” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“I smile at your simplicity. The General is playing a game. Spies\r\ncannot easily come and go so these two have been sent to feign\r\ndesertion that they may act as spies. The General is meeting one ruse\r\nwith another. He wants them to give information. Deceit is not to be\r\ndespised in war and his scheme is the correct one to employ.”\r\n\r\nThen Lu Su understood. That night as Chou Yü was sitting in his tent,\r\nHuang Kai came to see him privately. “You have surely some wise plan to\r\npropose that you come at night like this.”\r\n\r\nHuang Kai replied, “The enemy are more numerous than we and it is wrong\r\nto delay. Why not burn them out?”\r\n\r\n“Who suggested that to you?”\r\n\r\n“I thought of it myself, nobody suggested it,” replied Huang.\r\n\r\n“I just wanted something like this and that is why I kept those two\r\npretended deserters. I want them to give some news. The pity is that I\r\nhave no one to feign desertion to the other side and work my plan.”\r\n\r\n“But I will carry out your plan,” said Huang Kai.\r\n\r\n“But if you cannot show some injury you will not be believed,” said\r\nChou.\r\n\r\n“The Sun family have been very generous to me and I would not resent\r\nbeing crushed to death to repay them,” said Huang.\r\n\r\nThe General thanked him saying, “If you would not object to some bodily\r\nsuffering then our country would indeed be happy.”\r\n\r\n“Kill me; I do not mind,” repeated Huang Kai as he took his leave.\r\n\r\nNext day the drums called all the officers together to the General’s\r\ntent and Kʻung-ming came with the others. Chou Yü said, “The enemy’s\r\ncamps extend about three hundred li so that the campaign will be a long\r\none. Each leader is to prepare supplies for three months.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had he spoken when Huang Kai started up, crying, “Say not\r\nthree months; be ready for thirty months, and even then it will not be\r\nended. If you can destroy them this month then all is well. If you\r\ncannot, then it were better to take Chang Chao’s advice, throw down\r\nyour weapons, turn to the north and surrender.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü’s anger flared up and he flushed, crying, “Our lord’s orders\r\nwere to destroy Tsʻao Tsʻao and whoever mentioned the word surrender\r\nshould be put to death. Now, the very moment when the two armies are to\r\nengage, you dare talk of surrender and damp the ardour of my men! If I\r\ndo not slay you, how can I support the others?”\r\n\r\nHe ordered the lictors to remove Huang Kai and execute him without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nKai then flamed up in turn, saying, “This is the third generation since\r\nI went with General Pʻo-lo (Sun Chien) and we overran the south-east;\r\nwhence have you sprung up?”\r\n\r\nThis made Chou Yü perfectly furious and Huang Kai was ordered to\r\ninstant death. But Kan Ning interfered. Said he, “He is a veteran\r\nofficer of Wu; pray pardon him.”\r\n\r\n“What are you prating about?” cried Chou Yü. “Dare you come between me\r\nand my duty?” Turning to the lictors he ordered them to drive him forth\r\nwith blows.\r\n\r\nThe other officials fell on their knees entreating pity for Huang Kai.\r\n“He is indeed most worthy of death, but it would be a loss to the army;\r\nwe pray you forgive him. Record his fault for the moment and after the\r\nenemy shall have been defeated then put him to death.”\r\n\r\nBut Chou Yü was implacable. The officers pleaded with tears. At length\r\nhe seemed moved, saying, “Had you not interceded he should certainly\r\nhave suffered death. But now I will mitigate the punishment to a\r\nbeating. He shall not die.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to the lictors and bade them deal the culprit one hundred\r\nblows. Again his colleagues prayed for remission but Chou Yü angrily\r\npushed over the table in front of him and roared to the officers to get\r\nout of the way and let the sentence be executed.\r\n\r\nSo Huang Kai was stripped, thrown to the ground and fifty blows were\r\ngiven. At this point the officers again prayed that he be let off. Chou\r\nYü sprang from his chair and pointing his finger at Huang Kai said, “If\r\nyou dare flout me again you shall have the other fifty. If you are\r\nguilty of any disrespect, you shall be punished for both faults!”\r\n\r\nWith this he turned into the inner part of the tent, growling as he\r\nwent, while the officers helped their beaten colleague to his feet. He\r\nwas in a pitiable state. His back was cut in many places and the blood\r\nwas flowing in streams. They led him to his own quarters and on the way\r\nhe swooned several times. His case seemed most pitiable.\r\n\r\nLu Su went to see the suffering officer and then called on Kʻung-ming\r\nin his boat. He related the story of the beating and said that though\r\nthe other officers had been cowed into silence he thought Kʻung-ming\r\nmight have interceded. “You are a guest and not under his orders. Why\r\ndid you stand by with your hands up your sleeves and say never a word?”\r\n\r\n“You insult me,” said Kʻung-ming smiling.\r\n\r\n“Why do you say that? I have never insulted you; never since the day we\r\ncame here together.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not know that that terrible beating was but a ruse? How could I\r\ntry to dissuade him?”\r\n\r\nThen Lu Su began to perceive and Kʻung-ming continued, “Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nwould not be taken in unless there was some real bodily suffering. Now\r\nhe is going to send Huang Kai over as a deserter and he will see to it\r\nthat the two Tsʻao spies duly tell the tale. But when you see the\r\nGeneral you must not tell him that I saw through the ruse. You say that\r\nI am very angry like the others.”\r\n\r\nLu Su went to see Chou Yü and asked him why he had so cruelly beaten a\r\nproved and trusty officer.\r\n\r\n“Do the officers resent it?” asked Chou.\r\n\r\n“They are all upset about it.”\r\n\r\n“And what does your friend think?”\r\n\r\n“He also resents it in his heart, and thinks you have made a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have deceived him for once,” said Chou gleefully.\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” cried Lu.\r\n\r\n“That beating that Huang Kai got is part of my ruse. I am sending him\r\nto Tsʻao Tsʻao as a deserter and so I have supplied a reason for\r\ndesertion. Then I am going to use fire against the enemy.”\r\n\r\nLu Su kept silence but he recognised that Kʻung-ming was again right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Huang Kai lay in his tent, whither all his brother officers\r\nwent to condole with him and enquire after his health. But Kai would\r\nsay never a word; he only lay sighing deeply from time to time.\r\n\r\nBut when the strategist Kʻan Tsê came, Kai told them to bring him to\r\nthe room where he lay. Then he bade the servants go away and Tsê said,\r\n“Surely you must have some serious quarrel with the General.”\r\n\r\n“I have none,” said Kai.\r\n\r\n“Then this beating is just part of a ruse?”\r\n\r\n“How did you guess?” said Kai.\r\n\r\n“Because I watched the General and I guessed about nine tenths of the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nHuang said, “You see I have been very generously treated by the Sun\r\nfamily, all three of them, and have no means of showing my gratitude\r\nexcept by offering to help in this ruse. True I suffer, but I do not\r\nregret that. Among all those I know in the army there is not one I am\r\nintimate with except yourself. You are true and I can talk with you as\r\na friend.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you wish me to present your letter proposing to come over;\r\nis that it?”\r\n\r\n“Just that; will you do it?” said Huang.\r\n\r\nKʻan Tsê consented joyfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even the warrior’s body is but a stake in the game,\r\n    The friend so ready to help him proves that their hearts are the\r\n                                                                  same.\r\n\r\n\r\nKʻan’s reply will be read in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nKʻAN TSÊ PRESENTS THE TREACHEROUS LETTER:\r\nPʻAN TʻUNG SUGGESTS CHAINING THE SHIPS TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Kʻan Tsê was from Shanyin, a son of a humble family. He loved\r\nbooks, but as he was too poor to buy he used to borrow. He had a\r\nwonderfully tenacious memory, was very eloquent and no coward. Sun\r\nChʻüan had employed him among his advisers and he and Huang Kai were\r\nexcellent friends. The latter had thought of him to present the\r\ntreacherous letter as his gifts made him most suitable. Kʻan Tsê\r\naccepted with enthusiasm, saying, “When you, my friend, have suffered\r\nso much for our lord, could I spare myself? No; while a man lives he\r\nmust go on fulfilling his mission or he is no better than the herbs\r\nthat rot in the field.”\r\n\r\nHuang Kai slipped off the couch and came over to salute him.\r\n\r\n“However, this matter must speed,” continued Kʻan Tsê; “there is no\r\ntime to lose.”\r\n\r\n“The letter is already written,” said Huang Kai.\r\n\r\nKʻan Tsê received it and left. That night he disguised himself as an\r\nold fisherman and started in a small punt for the north shore, under\r\nthe cold, glittering light of the stars.\r\n\r\nSoon he drew near the enemy’s camp and was captured by the patrol.\r\nWithout waiting for day they informed their General, who said at once,\r\n“Is he not just a spy?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said they, “he is alone, just an old fisherman; and he says he is\r\nan adviser in the service of Wu named Kʻan Tsê, and he has come on\r\nsecret business.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao and he was led in. Tsʻao was seated in a\r\nbrilliantly lighted tent. He was leaning on a small table and as soon\r\nas he saw the prisoner, he said, “You are an adviser of Wu; what then\r\nare you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“People say that you greedily welcome men of ability; I do not think\r\nyour question a very proper one. Friend Huang, you made a mistake,”\r\nsaid Kʻan.\r\n\r\n“You know I am fighting against Wu and you come here privately. Why\r\nshould I not question you?”\r\n\r\n“Huang Kai is an old servant of Wu, one who has served three successive\r\nrulers. Now he has been cruelly beaten, for no fault, before the face\r\nof all the officers in Chou Yü’s camp. He is grievously angry about\r\nthis and wishes to desert to your side that he may be revenged. He\r\ndiscussed it with me, and as we are inseparable, I have come to give\r\nyou his letter asking whether you would receive him.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the letter?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThe missive was produced and presented. Tsʻao Tsʻao opened it and\r\nread:—“I, Huang Kai, have been generously treated by the Sun family and\r\nhave served them single-heartedly. Lately they have been discussing an\r\nattack with our forces on the enormous army of the central government.\r\nAs every one knows our few are no match for such a multitude and every\r\nofficer of Wu, wise or foolish, recognises that quite well. However,\r\nChou Yü who, after all, is but a youth and a shallow minded simpleton,\r\nmaintains that success is possible and rashly desires to smash stones\r\nwith an egg. Beside this he is arbitrary and tyrannical, punishing for\r\nno crime, and leaving meritorious service unrewarded. I am an old\r\nservant and for no reason have been shamed in the sight of men.\r\nWherefore I hate him in my heart.\r\n\r\n“You, O Minister, treat men with sincerity and are ready to welcome\r\nability and so I, and those under my leadership, desire to enter your\r\nservice whereby to acquire reputation and remove the shameful stigma.\r\nThe commissariat, weapons and the supply ships will also come over to\r\nyou. In perfect sincerity I state these matters; I pray you not to\r\ndoubt me.”\r\n\r\nLeaning there on the low table by his side, Tsʻao turned this letter\r\nover and over and read it again and again. Then he smacked the table,\r\nopened his eyes wide with anger saying, “Huang Kai is trying to play\r\nthe personal injury trick on me, is he? And you are in it as the\r\nintermediary to present the letter. How dare you come to sport with\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nHe ordered the lictors to thrust forth the messenger and take off his\r\nhead. Kan Tsê was hustled out, his face untroubled. On the contrary, he\r\nlaughed aloud. At this Tsʻao told them to bring him back and harshly\r\nsaid to him, “What do you find to laugh at now that I have foiled you\r\nand your ruse has failed?”\r\n\r\n“I was not laughing at you; I was laughing at my friend’s simplicity.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by his simplicity?”\r\n\r\n“If you want to slay, slay; do not trouble me with a multitude of\r\nquestions.”\r\n\r\n“I have read all the books on the art of war and I am well versed in\r\nall ways of misleading the enemy. This ruse of yours might have\r\nsucceeded with many, but it will not do for me.”\r\n\r\n“And so you say that the letter is a vicious trick?” said Kʻan.\r\n\r\n“What I say is that your little slip has sent you to the death you\r\nrisked. If the thing was real and you were sincere, why does not the\r\nletter name a time? What have you to say to that?”\r\n\r\nKʻan Tsê waited to the end and then laughed louder than ever, saying,\r\n“I am so glad you are not frightened, but can still boast of your\r\nknowledge of the books of war. Now you will not lead away your\r\nsoldiers. If you fight, Chou Yü will certainly capture you. But how sad\r\nto think I die at the hand of such an ignorant fellow!”\r\n\r\n“What mean you? I, ignorant?”\r\n\r\n“You are ignorant of any strategy and a victim of unreason; is not that\r\nsufficient?”\r\n\r\n“Well then, tell me where is any fault in my navy.”\r\n\r\n“You treat wise men too badly for me to talk to you. You can finish me\r\nand let there be an end of it.”\r\n\r\n“If you can speak with any show of reason, I will treat you\r\ndifferently.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not know that when one is going to desert one’s master and\r\nbecome a renegade one cannot say exactly when the chance will occur? If\r\none binds one’s self to a fixed moment and the thing cannot be done\r\njust then, the secret will be discovered. One must watch for an\r\nopportunity and take it when it comes. Think; is it possible to know\r\nexactly when? But you know nothing of common sense; all you know is how\r\nto put good men to death. So you really are an ignorant fellow.”\r\n\r\nAt this Tsʻao changed his manner, got up and came over to the prisoner\r\nbowing, “I did not see clearly; that is quite true. I offended you and\r\nI hope you will forget it.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is that Huang Kai and I are both inclined to desert to you;\r\nwe even yearn for it as a child desires its parents. Is it possible\r\nthat we should play you false?”\r\n\r\n“If you two could render me so great a service, you shall certainly be\r\nrichly rewarded.”\r\n\r\n“We do not desire rank or riches; we come because it is the will of\r\nheaven and the plain way of duty.”\r\n\r\nThen wine was set out and Kʻan Tsê was treated as an honoured guest.\r\nWhile they were drinking some one came in and whispered in Tsʻao’s ear.\r\nHe replied, “Let me see the letter.” Whereupon the man pulled out and\r\ngave him a letter, which evidently pleased him.\r\n\r\n“That is from the two Tsʻais,” thought Kʻan Tsê. “They are reporting\r\nthe punishment of my friend and that will be a proof of the sincerity\r\nof his letter.”\r\n\r\nTurning toward Kʻan Tsê, Tsʻao said, “I must ask you to return to\r\nsettle the date with your friend: as soon as I know I will have a force\r\nwaiting.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot return; pray, Sir, send some other man you can trust.”\r\n\r\n“If some one else should go the secret would out.”\r\n\r\nKʻan Tsê refused again and again but at last gave way, saying, “If I am\r\nto go I must not wait here; I must be off at once.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao offered him gold and silks, which were refused. Tsê started, left\r\nthe camp and re-embarked for the south bank, where he related all that\r\nhad happened to Huang Kai.\r\n\r\n“If it had not been for your persuasive tongue then had I undergone\r\nthis suffering in vain,” said Huang.\r\n\r\n“I will now go to get news of the two Tsʻais,” said Kʻan Tsê.\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” said Huang.\r\n\r\nHe went to the camp commanded by Kan Ning and when they were seated he\r\nsaid to his host, “I was much distressed when I saw how disgracefully\r\nyou were treated for your intercession on behalf of Huang Kai.”\r\n\r\nKan Ning smiled. Just then the two Tsʻais came, and host and guest\r\nexchanged glances. The former said, “The truth is the General is over\r\nconfident and he reckons us as nobody. We count for nothing. Every one\r\nis talking of the way I was insulted. Aiya!” and he shouted and gritted\r\nhis teeth and smacked the table in his wrath.\r\n\r\nKʻan Tsê leaned over toward his host and said something in a very low\r\nvoice, at which Kan Ning bent his head and sighed.\r\n\r\nThe two visitors and spies gathered from this that both Kan and Kʻan\r\nwere ripe for desertion and determined to probe them.\r\n\r\n“Why, Sir, do you anger him? Why not be silent about his injuries?”\r\nsaid they.\r\n\r\n“What know you of our bitterness?” said Kʻan Tsê.\r\n\r\n“We think you seem much inclined to go over to Tsʻao Tsʻao,” said they.\r\n\r\nKʻan Tsê at this lost colour: Kan Ning started up and drew his sword,\r\ncrying, “They have found out; they must die to keep their mouths shut.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried the two in a flurry. “Let us tell you something quite\r\nsecret.”\r\n\r\n“Quick, then,” cried Kan Ning.\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻai Ho said, “The truth is that we are only pretended deserters,\r\nand if you two gentlemen are of our way of thinking we can manage\r\nthings for you.”\r\n\r\n“But are you speaking the truth?” said Kan.\r\n\r\n“Is it likely we should say such a thing if it were untrue?” cried both\r\nat the same moment.\r\n\r\nKan Ning put on a pleased look and said, “Then this is the very\r\nheaven-given chance.”\r\n\r\n“You know we have already told Tsʻao of the Huang Kai affair and how\r\nyou were insulted.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is I have given the Minister a letter on behalf of Huang Kai\r\nand he sent me back again to settle the date of his desertion,” said\r\nKʻan.\r\n\r\n“When an honest man happens upon an enlightened master his heart will\r\nalways be drawn toward him,” said Kan Ning.\r\n\r\nThe four then drank together and opened their hearts to each other. The\r\ntwo brothers Tsʻai wrote a private letter to their master saying that\r\nKan Ning had agreed to join in their plot and play the traitor, and\r\nKʻan Tsê also wrote and they sent the letters secretly to Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\nKan’s letter said that Huang had found no opportunity so far. However,\r\nwhen he came his boat could be recognised by a black, indented flag.\r\nThat would mean he was on board.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Tsʻao Tsʻao got these two letters he was still doubtful\r\nand called together his advisers to talk over the matter. Said he, “On\r\nthe other side Kan Ning has been put to shame by the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwhom he is prepared to betray for the sake of revenge. Huang Kai has\r\nbeen punished and sent Kʻan Tsê to propose that he should come over to\r\nour side. Only I still distrust the whole thing. Who will go over to\r\nthe camp to find out the real truth?”\r\n\r\nThen Chiang Kan spoke up, saying, “I failed in my mission the other day\r\nand am greatly mortified. I will risk my life again and, this time, I\r\nshall surely bring good news.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao approved of him as messenger and bade him start. He set out\r\nin a small craft and speedily arrived in Chiangnan landing near the\r\nnaval camp. Then he sent to inform Chou Yü, who hearing who it was\r\nchuckled, saying, “Success depends upon this man.”\r\n\r\nThen he called Lu Su and told him to call Pʻang Tʻung to come and do\r\ncertain things for him.\r\n\r\nThis Pʻang Tʻung was from Hsiangyang. His other name was Shih-yüan and\r\nhe had gone to the east of the river to get away from the strife. Lu Su\r\nhad recommended him to Chou Yü, but he had not yet presented himself.\r\nWhen Chou Yü sent to ask what scheme of attack he would recommend\r\nagainst Tsʻao Tsʻao, Pʻang Tʻung had said to the messenger, “You must\r\nuse fire against him. But the river is wide and if one ship is set on\r\nfire the others will scatter unless they are fastened together so that\r\nthey must remain in one place. That is the one road to success.”\r\n\r\nLu Su took this message to the General, who pondered over it and then\r\nsaid, “The only person who can manage this is Pʻang Tʻung himself.”\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao is very wily,” said Lu Su, “how can Pʻang Tʻung go?”\r\n\r\nSo Chou Yü was sad and undecided. He could think of no method till\r\nsuddenly the means presented itself in the arrival of Chiang Kan. He at\r\nonce sent instructions to Pʻang Tʻung how to act and then sat himself\r\nin his tent to await his visitor Chiang Kan.\r\n\r\nBut the visitor became ill at ease and suspicious when he saw that his\r\nold student friend did not come to welcome him and he took the\r\nprecaution of sending his boat into a retired spot to be made fast\r\nbefore he went to the General’s tent.\r\n\r\nWhen Chou Yü saw him he put on an angry face and said, “My friend, why\r\ndid you treat me so badly?”\r\n\r\nChiang Kan laughed and said, “I remembered the old days when we were as\r\nbrothers and I came expressly to pour out my heart to you. Why do you\r\nsay I treated you badly?”\r\n\r\n“You came to persuade me to betray my master, which I would never do\r\nunless the sea dried up and the rocks perished. Remembering the old\r\ntimes I filled you with wine and kept you to sleep with me. And you;\r\nyou plundered my private letters and stole away with never a word of\r\nfarewell. You betrayed me to Tsʻao Tsʻao and caused the death of my two\r\nfriends on the other side and so caused all my plans to miscarry. Now\r\nwhat have you come for? Certainly it is not out of kindness to me and I\r\ncare no more for our old friendship; it is cut in two, destroyed. I\r\nwould send you back again, but within a day or two I shall attack that\r\nrebel and, if I let you stay in my camp, my plans will leak out. So I\r\nam going to tell my attendants to conduct you to a certain retired hut\r\nin the western hills and keep you there till I shall have won the\r\nvictory. Then I will send you back again.”\r\n\r\nChiang Kan tried to say something but Chou Yü would not listen. He\r\nturned his back and went into the recesses of his tent. The attendants\r\nled the visitor off, set him on a horse and took him away over the\r\nhills to the small hut, leaving two soldiers to look after him.\r\n\r\nWhen Chiang Kan found himself in the lonely hut he was very depressed\r\nand had no desire to eat or sleep. But one night, when the stars were\r\nvery brilliant, he strolled out to enjoy them. Presently he came to the\r\nrear of his lonely habitation and heard, near by, some one crooning\r\nover a book. Approaching with stealthy steps he saw a tiny cabin half\r\nhidden in a cliff whence a slender beam or two of light stole out\r\nbetween the rafters. He went nearer and peeping in, saw a man reading\r\nby the light of a lamp near which hung a sword. And the book was Sun\r\nWu’s “Art of War.”\r\n\r\n“This is no common person,” thought he and so he knocked at the door.\r\nThe door was opened by the reader, who bade him welcome with cultivated\r\nand refined ceremony. Chiang Kan enquired his name and the host replied\r\nthat he was Pʻang Tʻung, sometimes known as Shih-yüan.\r\n\r\n“Then you are surely The Master known as ‘Phoenix Fledgeling,’ are you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am he.”\r\n\r\n“How often have I heard you talked about! You are famous. But why are\r\nyou hidden away in this spot?”\r\n\r\n“That fellow Chou Yü is too conceited to allow that any one else has\r\nany talent and so I live here quietly. But who are you, Sir?”\r\n\r\n“I am Chiang Kan.”\r\n\r\nThen Pʻang Tʻung made him very welcome and led him in and the two sat\r\ndown to talk.\r\n\r\n“With your gifts you would succeed anywhere,” said Chiang Kan. “If you\r\nwould enter Tsʻao Tsʻao’s service I would recommend you to him.”\r\n\r\n“I have long desired to get away from here and if you, Sir, will\r\npresent me there is no time like the present. If Chou Yü heard of my\r\nwish he would kill me, I am sure.”\r\n\r\nSo without more ado they made their way down the hill to the water’s\r\nedge to seek the boat in which Chiang had come. They embarked and,\r\nrowing swiftly, they soon reached the northern shore. At the central\r\ncamp Chiang landed and went to seek Tsʻao Tsʻao to whom he related the\r\nstory of the discovery of his new acquaintance.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao heard that the newcomer was Fêng-chʻu, or the “Phoenix\r\nChick” Master, he went to meet him, made him very welcome and soon they\r\nsat down to talk on friendly terms.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao said questioningly, “And so Chou Yü in his youth is\r\nconceited and annoys his officers and rejects all their advice; I know\r\nthat. But your fame has been long known to me and now that you have\r\nbeen gracious enough to turn my way I pray you not to be niggardly of\r\nyour advice.”\r\n\r\n“I, too, know well that you are a model of military strategy,” said\r\nPʻang Tʻung, “but I should like to have one look at your disposition.”\r\n\r\nSo horses were brought and the two rode out to the lines, host and\r\nvisitor on equal terms, side by side. They ascended a hill whence they\r\nhad a wide view. After looking all round Pʻang Tʻung remarked, “Sun Wu,\r\ncome to life again, could not do better, nor Jang Chu if he reappeared.\r\nAll accords with the precepts. The camp is beside the hill and is\r\nflanked by a forest. The front and rear are within sight of each other.\r\nGates of egress and ingress are provided and the roads of advance and\r\nretirement are bent and broken.”\r\n\r\n“Master, I entreat you not to overpraise me, but to advise me where I\r\ncan make further improvements,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen the two men rode down to the naval camp, where twenty four\r\nopenings were arranged facing the south. The cruisers and the\r\nbattleships were all lined up so as to protect the lighter craft which\r\nlay inside. There were channels to pass to and fro and fixed anchorages\r\nand stations.\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung surveying all this smiled, saying, “Sir Minister, if this\r\nis your method of warfare, you enjoy no empty reputation.” Then\r\npointing to Chiangnan he went on, “Chou, my friend, Master Chou, you\r\nare finished; you will have to die.”\r\n\r\nThey rode back to the chief tent and wine was brought. They discussed\r\nmilitary matters and Pʻang Tʻung held forth at length. Remarks and\r\ncomments flowed freely between the two, and Tsʻao formed an exalted\r\nopinion of his new adherent’s abilities and treated him with the\r\ngreatest honour.\r\n\r\nBy and bye the guest seemed to have succumbed to the influence of many\r\ncups and said, “Have you any capable medical men in your army?”\r\n\r\n“What for?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“There is a lot of illness among the marines and you ought to find some\r\nremedy.”\r\n\r\nThe fact was that at this time Tsʻao’s men were suffering from the\r\nclimate; many were vomiting and not a few had died. It was a source of\r\ngreat anxiety to him and when the newcomer suddenly mentioned it, of\r\ncourse he had to ask advice.\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung said, “Your marine force is excellent, but there is just\r\none defect; it is not quite perfect.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao pressed him to say where the imperfection lay.\r\n\r\n“I have a plan to overcome the ailment of the men so that no one shall\r\nbe sick and all fit for service.”\r\n\r\n“What is this excellent scheme?” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“The river is wide and the tides ebb and flow. The winds and waves are\r\nnever at rest. Your men from the north are unused to ships and the\r\nmotion makes them ill. If your ships, large and small, were classed and\r\ndivided into thirties, or fifties, and joined up stem to stem by iron\r\nchains and boards spread across them, to say nothing of men being able\r\nto pass from one to the next, even horses could move about on them. If\r\nthis were done, then there would be no fear of the wind and the waves\r\nand the rising and falling tides.”\r\n\r\nComing down from his seat Tsʻao Tsʻao thanked his guest saying, “I\r\ncould never defeat the land of Wu without this scheme of yours.”\r\n\r\n“That is my idea,” said Pʻang Tʻung, “it is for you to decide about\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nOrders were then issued to call up all the blacksmiths and set them to\r\nwork, night and day, forging iron chains and great bolts to lock\r\ntogether the ships. And the men rejoiced when they heard of the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n        In Red Wall’s fight they used the flame,\r\n            The weapon here will be the same.\r\n        By Pʻang’s advice the ships were chained,\r\n            Else Chou had not that battle gained.\r\n\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung further told Tsʻao Tsʻao saying, “I know many bold men on\r\nthe other side who hate Chou Yü. If I may use my little tongue in your\r\nservice I can induce them to come over to you and if Chou Yü be left\r\nalone you can certainly take him captive. And Liu Pei is of no\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly if you could render me so great a service I would\r\nmemorialise the throne and obtain for you one of the highest offices,”\r\nsaid Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“I am not doing this for the sake of wealth or honours, but from a\r\ndesire to succour mankind. If you cross the river I pray you be\r\nmerciful.”\r\n\r\n“I am Heaven’s means of doing right and could not bear to slay the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung thanked him and begged for a document that would protect\r\nhis own family. Tsʻao Tsʻao asked where they lived. He replied that\r\nthey lived by the river bank and Tsʻao Tsʻao ordered a protection to be\r\nprepared. Having sealed it he gave it to Pʻang Tʻung who said, “You\r\nshould attack as soon as I have gone but do not let Chou Yü know\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao promised secrecy and the wily traitor took his leave. Just\r\nas he was about to embark he met a man in a Taoist robe, with a bamboo\r\ncomb in his hair, who stopped him saying, “You are very bold. Huang Kai\r\nis planning to use the ‘personal injury ruse’ and Kʻan Tsê has\r\npresented the letter of pretended desertion. You have proffered the\r\nfatal scheme of chaining the ships together lest the flames may not\r\ncompletely destroy them. This sort of mischievous work may have been\r\nenough to blind Tsʻao Tsʻao but I saw it all.”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung become helpless with fear, his three hun flown away, his\r\nseven po scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n        By guileful means one may succeed,\r\n        The victims too find friends in need.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will tell who the stranger was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nBANQUET ON THE YANGTSE; TSʻAO TSʻAO’S SONG:\r\nTHE NORTHERN MEN FIGHT ON THE CHAINED SHIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter Pʻang Tung was brought up with a sudden shock when\r\nsome one seized him and said he understood. Upon turning to look at the\r\nman he saw it was Hsü Shu, an old friend, and his heart revived.\r\nLooking around and seeing no one near he said, “It would be a pity if\r\nyou upset my plan; the fate of the people of all the eighty-one\r\ndistricts is in your hands.”\r\n\r\nHsü Shu smiled. “And what of the fate of these eighty-three legions of\r\nmen and horse?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Do you intend to wreck my scheme?”\r\n\r\n“I have never forgotten the kindness of Uncle Liu, nor my oath to\r\navenge the death of my mother at Tsʻao Tsʻao’s hands. I have said I\r\nwould never think out a plan for him. So am I likely to wreck yours\r\nnow, brother? But I have followed the army thus far and after they\r\nshall have been defeated, good and bad will suffer alike and how can I\r\nescape? Tell me how I can secure safety and I sew up my lips and go\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung smiled, “If you are as high-minded as that there is no\r\ngreat difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“Still I wish you would instruct me.”\r\n\r\nSo Pʻang Tʻung whispered something in his ear, which seemed to please\r\nHsü Shu greatly, for he thanked him most cordially and took his leave.\r\nThen Pʻang Tʻung betook himself to his boat and left for the southern\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nHis friend gone, Hsü Shu mischievously spread certain rumours in the\r\ncamp, and next day were to be seen everywhere men in small groups, some\r\ntalking, others listening, heads together and ears stretched out, till\r\nthe camps seemed to buzz. Some of the men went to Tsʻao Tsʻao and told\r\nhim that a rumour was running around that Han Sui and Ma Tʻêng had\r\nattacked the capital. This troubled Tsʻao Tsʻao, who called together\r\nhis advisers to council. Said he, “The only anxiety I have felt in this\r\nexpedition was about the possible doings of Han Sui and Ma Tʻêng. Now\r\nthere is a rumour running among the men, and though I know not whether\r\nit be true or false, it is necessary to be on one’s guard.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Hsü Shu said, “You have been kind enough to give me an\r\noffice, Sir, and I have really done nothing in return. If I may have\r\nthree companies I will march at once to San Pass and guard it. If there\r\nbe any pressing matter I will report at once.”\r\n\r\n“If you would do this I should be quite at my ease. There are already\r\nmen beyond the Pass, who will be under your command, and now I will\r\ngive you three companies of horse and foot and Tsang Pa shall lead the\r\nvan and march quickly.”\r\n\r\nHsü Shu took leave of the Minister and left in company with Tsang Pa.\r\nThis was Pʻang’s scheme to secure the safety of Hsü Shu.\r\n\r\nA poem says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tsʻao Tsʻao marched south, but at his back\r\n        There rode the fear of rear attack.\r\n        Pʻang Tʻung’s good counsel Hsü Shu took,\r\n        And thus the fish escaped the hook.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao’s anxiety diminished after he had thus sent away Hsü Shu.\r\nThen he rode round all the camps, first the land forces and then the\r\nnaval. He boarded one of the large ships and thereon set up his\r\nstandard. The naval camps were arranged along two lines and every ship\r\ncarried a thousand bows and crossbows.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained with the fleet occurred the full moon of the eleventh\r\nmonth of the twelfth year of “Established Tranquillity.” The sky was\r\nclear; there was no wind and the river lay unruffled. He prepared a\r\ngreat banquet, with music, and thereto invited all his captains. As\r\nevening drew on the moon rose over the eastern hills in its immaculate\r\nbeauty and beneath it lay the broad belt of the river like a band of\r\npure white silk. It was a great assembly and all the guests were clad\r\nin gorgeous silks and embroidered robes and the arms of the fighting\r\nmen glittered in the moonlight. The officers, civil and military, were\r\nseated in their proper order of precedence.\r\n\r\nThe setting, too, was exquisite. The Nanping hills were outlined as in\r\na picture; the boundaries of Chʻaisang lay in the east; the river\r\nshowed west as far as Hsiakʻou; on the south lay the Hills of Fan, on\r\nthe north was the “Black” Forest. The view stretched wide on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nTsʻao’s heart was jubilant and he harangued the assembly, “My one aim\r\nsince I enlisted my first small band of volunteers has been the removal\r\nof evil from the State and I have sworn to cleanse the country and\r\nrestore tranquillity. Now there is only left this land of Chiangnan to\r\nwithstand me. I am at the head of a hundred legions. I depend upon you,\r\ngentlemen, and have no doubt of my final success. After I have subdued\r\nChiangnan there will be no trouble in all the country. Then we shall\r\nenjoy wealth and honour and revel in peace.”\r\n\r\nThey rose in a body and expressed their appreciation saying, “We trust\r\nthat you may soon report complete victory and we shall all repose in\r\nthe shade of your good fortune.”\r\n\r\nIn his elation Tsʻao Tsʻao bade the servants bring more wine and they\r\ndrank till late at night. Warmed and mellowed, the host pointed to the\r\nsouth bank saying, “Chou Yü and Lu Su know not the appointed time.\r\nHeaven is aiding me bringing upon them the misfortune of the desertion\r\nof their most trusted friends.”\r\n\r\n“O Minister, say nothing of these things lest they become known to the\r\nenemy,” said Hsün Yu.\r\n\r\nBut the Minister only laughed. “You are all my trusty friends,” said\r\nhe, “both officers and humble attendants. Why should I refrain?”\r\n\r\nPointing to Hsiakʻou he continued, “You do not reckon for much with\r\nyour puny force, Liu Pei and Chuko Liang. How foolish of you to attempt\r\nto shake Tʻaishan! I am now fifty-four and if I get Chiangnan I shall\r\nhave the wherewithal to rejoice. In the days of long ago the late noble\r\nChʻiao and I were great friends and we came to an agreement on certain\r\nmatters, for I knew his two daughters were lovely beyond words. Then by\r\nsome means they became wives to Sun Tsʻê and Chou Yü. But now my palace\r\nof rest is built on the Chang River and victory over the south will\r\nmean that I marry these two fair women. I will put them in my palace\r\nand they shall rejoice my declining years. My desires will then be\r\ncompletely attained.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled at the anticipation.\r\n\r\nTu Mu, a poet of the Tʻang Dynasty, in one poem says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        A broken halberd buried in the sand,\r\n            With deep rust eaten.\r\n        Loud tells of ancient battles on the strand,\r\n            When Tsʻao was beaten.\r\n        Had eastern winds Chou’s plan refused to aid\r\n            And fan the flame,\r\n        Two captives fair, locked in the Bronze Bird’s shade,\r\n            Had gone to shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut suddenly amid the merriment was heard the hoarse cry of a raven\r\nflying toward the south.\r\n\r\n“Why does the raven thus cry in the night?” said Tsʻao to those about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“The moon is so bright that he thinks it is day,” said they, “and so he\r\nleaves his tree.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao laughed; by this time he was quite intoxicated. He set up his\r\nspear in the prow of the ship and poured a libation into the river and\r\nthen drank three brimming goblets. As he lowered the spear he said,\r\n“This is the spear that broke up the Yellow Turbans, captured Lü Pu,\r\ndestroyed Yüan Shao and subdued his brother, whose armies are now mine.\r\nIn the north it reached to Liaotung and it stretched out over the whole\r\nsouth. It has never failed in its task. The present scene moves me to\r\nthe depths and I will sing a song in which you shall accompany me.”\r\n\r\nAnd so he sang:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        When goblets are brimming then song is near birth,\r\n        But life is full short and has few days of mirth,\r\n        Life goes as the dew drops fly swiftly away,\r\n        ’Neath the glance of the glowing hot ruler of day.\r\n        Man’s life may be spent in the noblest emprise,\r\n        But sorrowful thoughts in his heart oft arise.\r\n        Let us wash clean away the sad thoughts that intrude,\r\n        With bumpers of wine such as Tu Kʻang once brewed.\r\n        Gone is my day of youthful fire\r\n        And still ungained is my desire.\r\n        The deer feed on the level plain\r\n        And joyful call, then feed again.\r\n        My noble guests are gathered round,\r\n        The air is trilled with joyful sound.\r\n        Bright my future lies before me,\r\n        As the moonlight on this plain;\r\n        But I strive in vain to reach it\r\n        When shall I my wish attain?\r\n        None can answer; and so sadness\r\n        Grips my inmost heart again.\r\n        Far north and south,\r\n        Wide east and west,\r\n        We safety seek;\r\n        Vain is the quest.\r\n        Man’s heart oft yearns\r\n        For converse sweet,\r\n        And my heart burns\r\n        When old friends greet.\r\n        The stars are paled by the full moon’s light,\r\n        The raven wings his southward flight,\r\n        And thrice he circles round a tree,\r\n        No place thereon to rest finds he.\r\n        They weary not the mountains of great height,\r\n        The waters deep of depth do not complain,\r\n        Duke Chou no leisure found by day or night\r\n        Stern toil is his who would the Empire gain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song made they sang it with him and were all exceedingly merry;\r\nsave one guest who suddenly said, “When the great army is on the point\r\nof battle and lives are about to be risked, why do you, O Minister,\r\nspeak such ill words?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao turned quickly toward the speaker, who was Liu Fu, the Governor\r\nof Yangchou. This Liu sprang from Hofei. When first appointed to his\r\npost he had gathered in the terrified and frightened people and\r\nrestored order. He had founded schools and encouraged the people to\r\ntill the land. He had long served under Tsʻao Tsʻao and rendered\r\nvaluable service.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke Tsʻao dropped his spear to the level and said, “What\r\nill-omened words did I use?”\r\n\r\n“You spoke of the moon paling the stars and the raven flying southward\r\nwithout finding a resting place. These are ill-omened words.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you try to belittle my endeavour?” cried Tsʻao, very\r\nwrathful; and with that he smote Liu Fu with his spear and slew him.\r\n\r\nThe assembly broke up and the guests dispersed in fear and confusion.\r\nNext day, when he had recovered from his drunken bout, Tsʻao Tsʻao was\r\nvery grieved at what he had done and when the murdered man’s son came\r\nto crave the body of his father for burial, Tsʻao wept and expressed\r\nhis sorrow.\r\n\r\n“I am guilty of your father’s death; I was drunk yesterday. I regret\r\nthe deed exceedingly. Your father shall be interred with the honours of\r\na minister of the highest rank.”\r\n\r\nHe sent an escort of soldiers to take the body home for burial.\r\n\r\nA few days after this the two leaders of the naval force came to say\r\nthe ships were all connected together by chains as had been ordered,\r\nand all was now ready. They asked for the command to start.\r\n\r\nThereupon the leaders of both land and naval forces were assembled on\r\nboard a large ship in the centre of the squadron to receive orders. The\r\nvarious armies and squadrons were distinguished by different flags, the\r\ncentral naval squadron, yellow; the leading squadron, red; the rear\r\nsquadron, black; the left, blue, and the right, white. On shore the\r\nhorsemen had a red flag; for the vanguard, black; blue and white for\r\nthe rearguard and the wings respectively. Hsiahou Tun and Tsʻao Hung\r\nwere in reserve and the general staff was under the leadership of Hsü\r\nChʻu and Chang Liao. The other leaders were ordered to remain in camp,\r\nbut ready for action.\r\n\r\nAll being ready, the squadron drums beat the roll thrice and the ships\r\nsailed out under a strong north-west wind on a trial cruise and when\r\nthey got among the waves they were found to be as steady and immoveable\r\nas the dry land itself. The northern men showed their delight at the\r\nabsence of motion by capering and flourishing their weapons. The ships\r\nmoved on, the squadrons keeping quite distinct. Fifty light cruisers\r\nsailed to and fro keeping order and urging progress.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao watched his navy from the General’s terrace and was\r\ndelighted with their evolutions and manœuvres. Surely this meant\r\ncomplete victory. He ordered the recall and the squadrons returned in\r\nperfect order to their base.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao went to his tent and summoned his advisers. He said,\r\n“If Heaven had not been on my side, should I have got this excellent\r\nplan from the Phoenix Chick? Now that the ships are attached firmly to\r\neach other, one may traverse the river as easily as walking on firm\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\n“The ships are firmly attached to each other,” said Chʻêng Yü, “but you\r\nshould be prepared for an attack by fire so that they can scatter to\r\navoid it.”\r\n\r\nThe General laughed. “You look a long way ahead,” said he, “but you see\r\nwhat cannot happen.”\r\n\r\n“He speaks much to the point” said Hsün Yü, “why do you laugh at him?”\r\n\r\n“Any one using fire depends upon the wind. This is now winter and only\r\nwest winds blow. You will get neither east nor south winds. I am on the\r\nnorth-west and the enemy is on the south bank. If they use fire they\r\nwill destroy themselves. I have nothing to fear. If it was the tenth\r\nmoon, or early spring, I would provide against fire.”\r\n\r\n“The Minister is indeed wise,” said the others in chorus. “None can\r\nequal him.”\r\n\r\n“With northern men unused to shipboard I could never have crossed the\r\nriver but for this plan,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen he saw two of the secondary leaders stand up and they said, “We\r\nare from the north, but we are also sailors. Pray give us a small\r\nsquadron and we will seize some of the enemy’s flags and drums for you\r\nthat we may prove ourselves adepts on the water.”\r\n\r\nThe speakers were two men who had served under Yüan Shao, named Chiao\r\nChʻu and Chang Nan.\r\n\r\n“I do not think naval work would suit you two, born and brought up in\r\nthe north,” said Tsʻao. “The Chiangnan men are thoroughly accustomed to\r\nships. You should not regard your lives as a child’s plaything.”\r\n\r\nThey cried, “If we fail, treat us according to army laws.”\r\n\r\n“The fighting ships are all chained together, there are only small,\r\ntwenty-men boats free. They are unsuitable for fighting.”\r\n\r\n“If we took large ships where would be the wonderful in what we will\r\ndo? No; give us a score of the small ships and we will take half each\r\nand go straight to the enemy’s naval port. We will just seize a flag,\r\nslay a leader and come home.”\r\n\r\n“I will let you have the twenty ships and half a company of good,\r\nvigorous men with long spears and stiff crossbows. Early to-morrow the\r\nmain fleet shall make a demonstration on the river and I will also tell\r\nWên Pʻing to support you with thirty ships.”\r\n\r\nThe two men retired greatly elated. Next morning, very early, food was\r\nprepared and at the fifth watch all was ready for a start. Then from\r\nthe naval camp rolled out the drums and the gongs clanged, as the ships\r\nmoved out and took up their positions, the various flags fluttering in\r\nthe morning breeze. And the two intrepid leaders with their squadron of\r\nsmall scouting boats went down the lines and out into the stream.\r\n\r\nNow a few days before the sound of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s drums had been heard\r\non the southern bank and the watchers had seen their enemy’s fleet\r\nmanœuvring in the open river. Chou Yü had watched the manœuvres from\r\nthe top of a hill till the fleet had gone in again. So when the sound\r\nof drums was again heard all the army went up the hills to watch the\r\nfleet. All they saw was a squadron of small ships bounding over the\r\nwaves. But as they came nearer the news was taken to the leader who\r\ncalled for volunteers to go out against them. Han Tang and Chou Tʻai\r\noffered themselves. They were accepted and orders were issued to the\r\ncamps to remain ready for action but not to move till told.\r\n\r\nHan and Chou sailed out each with a small squadron of five ships in\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe two braggarts from the north really only trusted to their boldness\r\nand luck. Their ships came down under the powerful strokes of the oars\r\nand as they neared the two leaders put on their heart-protectors,\r\ngripped their spears and each took his station in the prow of the\r\nleading ship of his division. Chiao’s ship led and as soon as he came\r\nnear enough his men began to shoot at Han Tang, who fended off the\r\narrows with his buckler. Chiao twirled his long spear as he engaged his\r\nopponent. But, at the first thrust, he was killed.\r\n\r\nHis comrade with the other ships was coming up with great shouts when\r\nChou Tʻai sailed up at an angle and these two squadrons began shooting\r\narrows at each other in clouds. Chou Tʻai fended off the arrows with\r\nhis shield and stood gripping his sword firmly till his ships came\r\nwithin a few feet of the enemy’s ships when he leaped across and cut\r\ndown Chang Nan. Chang’s dead body fell into the water. Then the battle\r\nbecame confused and the attacking ships rowed hard to get away. The\r\nsoutherners pursued but soon came in sight of Wên Pʻing’s supporting\r\nfleet. Once more the ships engaged and the men fought with each other.\r\n\r\nChou Yü with his officers stood on the summit of a mountain and watched\r\nhis own and the enemy ships out on the river. The flags and the ensigns\r\nwere all in perfect order. Then he saw Wên Pʻing and his own fleets\r\nengaged in battle and soon it was evident that the former was not a\r\nmatch for his own sailors. Wên Pʻing turned about to retire, Chou and\r\nHan pursued. Chou Yü fearing lest his sailors should go too far, then\r\nhoisted the white flag of recall.\r\n\r\nTo his officers Chou Yü said, “The masts of their ships stand thick as\r\nreeds; Tsʻao himself is full of wiles; how can we destroy him?”\r\n\r\nNo one replied, for just then the great yellow flag that flapped in the\r\nbreeze in the middle of Tsʻao’s fleet suddenly fell over into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nChou Yü laughed. “That is a bad omen,” said he.\r\n\r\nThen an extra violent blast of wind came by and the waves rose high and\r\nbeat upon the bank. A corner of his own flag flicked Chou Yü on the\r\ncheek and suddenly a thought flashed through his mind. He uttered a\r\nloud cry, staggered and fell backward. They picked him up; there was\r\nblood upon his lips and he was unconscious. Presently, however, he\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\r\n        And once he laughed, then gave a cry,\r\n        ’Tis hard to ensure a victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nChou Yü’s fate will appear as the story unfolds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nON THE SEVEN STARS ALTAR CHUKO SACRIFICES TO THE WINDS:\r\nAT THE THREE RIVERS CHOU YÜ LIBERATES FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter Chou Yü was seized with sudden illness as he\r\nwatched the fleets of his enemy. He was borne to his tent and his\r\nofficers came in multitudes to enquire after him. They looked at each\r\nother saying, “What a pity our general should be taken ill when Tsʻao’s\r\nlegions threaten so terribly! What would happen if he attacked?”\r\n\r\nMessengers with the evil tidings were sent to Wu while the physicians\r\ndid their best for the invalid. Lu Su was particularly sad at the\r\nillness of his patron and went to see Kʻung-ming to talk it over.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it?” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“Good luck for Tsʻao Tsʻao; bad for us,” said Lu.\r\n\r\n“I could cure him,” said Kʻung-ming laughing.\r\n\r\n“If you could the State would be very fortunate,” said Lu.\r\n\r\nHe prayed Kʻung-ming to go to see the sick man. They went, and Lu Su\r\nentered first. Chou Yü lay in bed, his head covered by a quilt.\r\n\r\n“How are you, General?” said Lu.\r\n\r\n“My heart pains me; every now and again I feel faint and dizzy.”\r\n\r\n“Have you taken any remedies?”\r\n\r\n“My gorge rises at the thought; I could not.”\r\n\r\n“I saw Kʻung-ming just now and he says he could heal you. He is just\r\noutside and I will call him if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Ask him to come in.”\r\n\r\nChou bade his servants help him to a sitting position and Kʻung-ming\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n“I have not seen you for days,” said he. “How could I guess that you\r\nwere unwell?”\r\n\r\n“How can any one feel secure? We are constantly the playthings of luck,\r\ngood or bad.\r\n\r\n“Yes; Heaven’s winds and clouds are not to be measured. No one can\r\nreckon their comings and goings, can they?”\r\n\r\nChou Yü turned pale and a low groan escaped him, while his visitor went\r\non, “You feel depressed, do you not? As though troubles were piling up\r\nin your heart?”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly how I feel.”\r\n\r\n“You need cooling medicine to dissipate this sense of oppression.”\r\n\r\n“I have taken a cooling draught, but it has done no good.”\r\n\r\n“You must get the humours into good order before the drugs will have\r\nany effect.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü began to think Kʻung-ming knew what was really the matter and\r\nresolved to test him. “What should be taken to produce a favourable\r\ntemper?”\r\n\r\n“I know one means of producing a favourable temper,” replied\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would tell me.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming got out writing materials, sent away the servants and then\r\nwrote a few words:—“One should burn out Tsʻao; all is ready, but there\r\nis no east wind,” this he gave to the sick general, saying “That is the\r\norigin of your illness.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü read the words with great surprise and it confirmed his secret\r\nopinion that Kʻung-ming really was rather more than human. He decided\r\nthat the only course was to be open and tell him all. So he said,\r\n“Since you know the cause of the disease, what do you recommend as\r\ntreatment? The need of a remedy is very urgent.”\r\n\r\n“I have no great talent,” said Kʻung-ming, “but I have had to do with\r\nmen of no ordinary gifts from whom I have received certain magical\r\nbooks. I can call the winds and summon the rains. Since you need a\r\nsouth-east breeze, General, you must build an altar on the Nanping\r\nMountains, the Altar of the Seven Stars. It must be nine feet high,\r\nwith three steps, surrounded by a guard of one hundred and twenty men\r\nbearing flags. On this altar I will work a spell to procure a strong\r\nsouth-east gale for three days and three nights. Do you approve?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind three whole days;” said Chou Yü, “one day of strong wind\r\nwill serve my purpose. But it must be done at once and without delay.”\r\n\r\n“I will sacrifice for a wind for three days from the twentieth day of\r\nthe moon; will that suit you?”\r\n\r\nChou Yü was delighted and hastily rose from his couch to give the\r\nnecessary orders. He commanded that five hundred men should be sent to\r\nthe mountains to build the altar and he told off the guard of one\r\nhundred and twenty to bear the flags and be at the orders of\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming took his leave, went forth and rode off with Lu Su to the\r\nmountains where they measured out the ground. He bade the soldiers\r\nbuild the altar of red earth from the south-east quarter. It was two\r\nhundred and forty feet in circuit, square in shape, and of three tiers,\r\neach of three feet, in all nine feet high. On the lowest tier he placed\r\nthe flags of the twenty-eight “houses” of the heavens; on the east\r\nseven, with blue flags, on the north seven, with black flags, on the\r\nwest seven, with white flags, and on the south seven, with red flags.\r\nAround the second tier he placed sixty-four yellow flags, corresponding\r\nto the number of the diagrams of the Book of Divination, in eight\r\ngroups of eight. Four men were stationed on the highest platform, each\r\nwearing a Taoist headdress and a black silk robe embroidered with the\r\nphoenix and confined with wide sashes. They wore scarlet boots and\r\nsquare-cut skirts. On the left front stood a man supporting a tall pole\r\nbearing at its top a plume of light feathers to show by their least\r\nmovement the wind’s first breathing. On the right front was a man\r\nholding a tall pole whereon was a flag with the symbol of the seven\r\nstars to show the direction and force of the wind. On the left rear\r\nstood a man with a sword, and on the right rear a man with a censer.\r\nBelow the altar were two score and four men holding flags, umbrellas,\r\nspears, lances, yellow banners, white axes, red bannerols and black\r\nensigns. And these were spaced about the altar.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day Kʻung-ming, having chosen a propitious moment,\r\nbathed his body and purified himself. Then he robed himself as a\r\nTaoist, loosened his locks and approached the altar.\r\n\r\nHe bade Lu Su retire saying, “Return to the camp and assist the General\r\nin setting out his forces. Should my prayers avail not, do not wonder.”\r\n\r\nSo Lu Su left him. Then he commanded the guards on no account to absent\r\nthemselves, to maintain strict silence and to be reverent; death would\r\nbe the penalty of disobedience.\r\n\r\nNext with solemn steps he ascended the altar, faced the proper quarter,\r\nlighted the incense and sprinkled the water in the basins. This done he\r\ngazed into the heavens and prayed silently. The prayer ended he\r\ndescended and returned to his tent. After a brief rest he allowed the\r\nsoldiers by turns to go away to eat.\r\n\r\nThrice that day he ascended the altar and thrice descended; but there\r\nwas no sign of the wind.\r\n\r\nHere it may be related that Chou Yü with Chʻêng Pʻu and Lu Su and a\r\ncertain number of military officials on duty, sat waiting in the tent\r\ntill the wished-for wind should blow and the attack could be launched.\r\nMessengers were also sent to Sun Chʻüan to prepare to support the\r\nforward movement.\r\n\r\nHuang Kai had his fire ships ready, a score of them. The fore parts of\r\nthe ships were thickly studded with large nails, and they were loaded\r\nwith dry reeds, wood soaked in fish oil and covered with sulphur,\r\nsaltpetre and other inflammables. The ships were covered in with black\r\noiled cloth. In the prow of each was a black dragon flag with\r\nindentations. A fighting ship was attached to the stern of each to\r\npropel it forward. All were ready and awaited orders to move.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tsʻao Tsʻao’s two spies, the brothers Tsʻai, were being\r\nguarded carefully in an outer camp far from the river bank and daily\r\nentertained with feasting. They were not allowed to know of the\r\npreparations. The watch was so close that not a trickle of information\r\nreached the prisoners.\r\n\r\nPresently, while Chou Yü was anxiously awaiting in his tent for the\r\ndesired wind, a messenger came to say that Sun Chʻüan had anchored at a\r\nplace eighty-five li from the camp, where he awaited news. Lu Su was\r\nsent to warn all the various commanders to be ready, the ships and\r\ntheir weapons, sails and oars, all for instant use, and to impress upon\r\nthem the penalties of being caught unprepared. The soldiers were indeed\r\nready for the fight and yearning for the fray.\r\n\r\nBut the sky remained obstinately clear and as night drew nigh no breath\r\nof air stirred.\r\n\r\n“We have been cajoled,” said Chou Yü. “Indeed what possibility is there\r\nof a south-east wind in mid-winter?”\r\n\r\n“Kʻung-ming would not use vain and deceitful words,” replied Lu Su.\r\n\r\nTowards the third watch the sound of a movement arose in the air. Soon\r\nthe flags fluttered out. And when the general went out to make sure he\r\nsaw they were flowing toward the north-west. In a very short time the\r\nsouth-east wind was in full force.\r\n\r\nChou Yü was, however, frightened at the power of the man whose help he\r\nhad invoked. “Really the man has power over the heavens and authority\r\nover the earth; his methods are incalculable, beyond the ken of god or\r\ndevil. He cannot be allowed to live to be a danger to our land of Wu.\r\nWe must slay him soon to fend off later evils.”\r\n\r\nSo he resolved to commit a crime to remove his dangerous rival. He\r\ncalled two of the captains of his guard, Ting Fêng and Hsü Shêng, and\r\nbade each take a party, one along the river, the other along the road,\r\nto the altar on the mountains. As soon as they got there, without\r\nasking questions or giving reasons, they were to seize and behead\r\nKʻung-ming. They might expect a solid reward if they brought his head.\r\n\r\nThe two went off on their nefarious errand, one leading dagger- and\r\naxe-men going as fast as oars could propel them along the river, the\r\nother at the head of archers and bowmen on horseback. The south-east\r\nwind buffeted them as they went on their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n        High was raised the Seven Stars’ Altar,\r\n        On it prayed the Sleeping Dragon\r\n        For an eastern wind, and straightway\r\n        Blew the wind. Had not the wizard\r\n        Exercised his mighty magic\r\n        Nought had Chou Yü’s skill availed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTing Fêng first arrived. He saw the guards with their flags, dropped\r\noff his steed and marched to the altar, sword in hand. But he found no\r\nKʻung-ming. He asked the guards; they told him he had just gone down.\r\nTing Fêng ran down the hill to search. There he met his fellow and they\r\njoined forces. Presently a simple soldier told them that the evening\r\nbefore a small, fast boat had anchored there near a sand spit and\r\nKʻung-ming had been seen to go on board. Then the boat had gone up\r\nriver. So they divided their party into two, one to go by water, the\r\nother by land.\r\n\r\nHsü Shêng bade his boatmen put on all sail and take every advantage of\r\nthe wind. Before very long he saw the fugitive’s boat ahead and when\r\nnear enough, stood in the prow of his own and shouted, “Do not flee, O\r\nInstructor of the Army! The General requests your presence.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming, who was seated in the stern of his boat, just laughed\r\naloud, “Return and tell the General to make good use of his men. Tell\r\nhim I am going up river for a spell and will see him again another\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“Pray wait a little while,” cried Hsü. “I have something most important\r\nto tell you.”\r\n\r\n“I knew all about it, that he would not let me go and that he wanted to\r\nkill me. That is why Chao Yün was waiting for me. You had better not\r\napproach nearer.”\r\n\r\nSeeing the other ship had no sail, Hsü Shêng thought he would assuredly\r\ncome up with it and so maintained the pursuit. Then when he got too\r\nclose Chao Yün fitted an arrow to the bowstring and, standing up in the\r\nstern of his boat, cried, “You know who I am and I came expressly to\r\nescort the Instructor. Why are you pursuing him? One arrow would kill\r\nyou, only that would cause a breach of the peace between two houses. I\r\nwill shoot and just give you a specimen of my skill.”\r\n\r\nWith that he shot, and the arrow whizzed overhead cutting the rope that\r\nheld up the sail. Down came the sail trailing in the water and the boat\r\nswung round. Then Chao Yün’s boat hoisted its sail and the fair wind\r\nspeedily carried it out of sight.\r\n\r\nOn the bank stood Ting Fêng. He bade his comrade come to the shore and\r\nsaid, “He is too clever for any man; and Chao Yün is bravest of the\r\nbrave. You remember what he did at Tangyang Slope. All we can do is to\r\nreturn and report.”\r\n\r\nSo they returned to camp and told their master about the preparations\r\nthat Kʻung-ming had made to ensure safety. Chou Yü was indeed puzzled\r\nat the depth of his rival’s insight. “I shall have no peace day or\r\nnight while he lives,” said he.\r\n\r\n“At least wait till Tsʻao is done with,” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\nAnd Chou Yü knew he spake wisely. Having summoned the leaders to\r\nreceive orders, first he bade Kan Ning take with him the false deserter\r\nTsʻai Chung and his soldiers and go along the south bank, showing the\r\nflags of Tsʻao Tsʻao, till they reached the “Black” Forest (Wu Lin)\r\njust opposite the enemy’s main store of grain and forage. Then they\r\nwere to penetrate as deeply as possible into the enemy’s lines and\r\nlight a torch as a signal. Tsʻai Chung’s brother was to be kept in camp\r\nfor another purpose.\r\n\r\nThe next order was for Tʻaishih Tzŭ; he was to lead two companies as\r\nquickly as possible to Huangchou and cut the enemy’s communications\r\nwith Hofei. When near the enemy he was to give a signal and if he saw a\r\nred flag he would know that Sun Chʻüan was at hand with reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThese two had the farthest to go and started first. Then Lü Mêng was\r\nsent into Wu Lin (the “Black” Forest) with three companies as a\r\nsupport. Kan Ning was ordered to set fire to the camp. A fourth party\r\nwas to go to the borders of Iling and attack as soon as the signal from\r\nthe forest was seen. A fifth party of three companies went to Hanyang\r\nto fall upon the enemy along the river. Their signal was a white flag\r\nand a sixth division supported them.\r\n\r\nWhen these six parties had gone off, Huang Kai got ready his fire ships\r\nand sent a soldier with a note to tell Tsʻao Tsʻao that he was coming\r\nover that evening. Four fighting ships were told off to support Huang\r\nKai.\r\n\r\nThe four squadrons, each of three hundred ships, were placed under four\r\ncommanders, Han Tang, Chou Tʻai, Chiang Chʻin and Chʻên Wu. The score\r\nof fire ships preceded them. Chou Yü and Chʻêng Pʻu went on board one\r\nof the large ships to direct the battle. Their guards were Ting Fêng\r\nand Hsü Shêng. Lu Su, Kʻan Tsê and the advisers were left to guard the\r\ncamp. Chʻêng Pʻu was greatly impressed with Chou Yü’s ordering of the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThen came a messenger bearing a mandate from Sun Chʻüan making Lu Hsün\r\nleader of the van. He was ordered to go to Chʻihuang. The Marquis\r\nhimself would support him. Chou Yü also sent a man to the western hills\r\nto make signals and to hoist flags on the Nanping Mountains.\r\n\r\nSo all being prepared they waited for dusk.\r\n\r\nHere it is necessary to diverge from the direct narrative to say that\r\nYüan-tê was at Hsiakʻou anxiously awaiting the return of his adviser.\r\nThen appeared a fleet, led by Liu Chʻi, who had come to find out how\r\nmatters were progressing. Yüan-tê sent to call him to the battle tower\r\nand told him of the south-east wind that had begun to blow and that\r\nChao Yün had gone to meet Kʻung-ming. Not long after a single sail was\r\nseen coming up before the wind and he knew it was Kʻung-ming, the\r\nInstructor of the Army. So he and Liu Chʻi went down to meet the boat.\r\nSoon the vessel reached the shore and Kʻung-ming and Chao Yün\r\ndisembarked.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was very glad and after they had enquired after each other’s\r\nwell-being Kʻung-ming said, “There is no time to tell of any other\r\nthings now. Are the soldiers and ships ready?”\r\n\r\n“They have long been ready,” replied Yüan-tê. “They only await you to\r\ndirect how they are to be used.”\r\n\r\nThe three then went to the tent and took their seats. Kʻung-ming at\r\nonce began to issue orders. “Chao Yün, with three companies is to cross\r\nthe river and go to the Wu Lin by the minor road. He will choose a\r\ndense jungle and prepare an ambush. To-night, after the fourth watch,\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao will hurry along that way. When half his men have passed,\r\nthe jungle is to be fired. Tsʻao Tsʻao will not be wholly destroyed but\r\nmany will perish.”\r\n\r\n“There are two roads,” said Chao Yün. “One leads to the southern\r\ndistricts and the other to Chingchou. I do not know by which he will\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n“The south road is too dangerous; Tsʻao Tsʻao will certainly pass along\r\nthe Chingchou road, so that he may get away to Hsüchʻang.”\r\n\r\nThen Chao Yün went away. Next Kʻung-ming said to Chang Fei, “You will\r\ntake three companies over the river to cut the road to Iling. You will\r\nambush in the Hulu Valley. Tsʻao Tsʻao, not daring to go to South\r\nIling, will go to North Iling. To-morrow, after the rain, he will halt\r\nto refresh his men. As soon as the smoke is seen to rise from their\r\ncooking fires you will fire the hill side. You will not capture Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao but you will render excellent service.”\r\n\r\nSo Chang Fei left. Next was called Mi Chu, Mi Fang and Liu Fêng. They\r\nwere to take command of three squadrons and go along the river to\r\ncollect the weapons that the beaten soldiers would throw away.\r\n\r\nThe three left. Then Kʻung-ming said to Liu Chʻi, “The country around\r\nWuchʻang is very important and I wish you to take command of your own\r\ntroops and station them at strategic points. Tsʻao Tsʻao, being\r\ndefeated, will flee thither, and you will capture him. But you are not\r\nto leave the city without the best of reasons.”\r\n\r\nAnd Liu Chʻi took leave.\r\n\r\nThen Kʻung-ming said to Yüan-tê, “I wish you to remain quietly and\r\ncalmly in Fankʻou while Chou Yü works out his great scheme this night.”\r\n\r\nAll this time Kuan Yü has been silently waiting his turn but Kʻung-ming\r\nsaid no word to him. When he could bear this no longer he cried, “Since\r\nI first followed my brother to battle many years ago I have never been\r\nleft behind. Now that great things are afoot is there no work for me?\r\nWhat is meant by it?”\r\n\r\n“You should not be surprised. I wanted you for service at a most\r\nimportant point only that there was a something standing in the way\r\nthat prevented me from sending you,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“What could stand in the way? I wish you would tell me.”\r\n\r\n“You see Tsʻao Tsʻao was once very kind to you and you cannot help\r\nfeeling grateful. Now when his soldiers have been beaten he will have\r\nto flee along the Huayung road and if I sent you to guard it you would\r\nhave to let him pass. So I will not send you.”\r\n\r\n“You are most considerate, Instructor. But though it is true that he\r\ntreated me well, yet I slew two of his most redoubtable opponents by\r\nway of repayment, beside raising a siege. If I happened upon him on\r\nthis occasion I should hardly let him go.”\r\n\r\n“But what if you did?”\r\n\r\n“You could deal with me by military rules.”\r\n\r\n“Then put that in writing.”\r\n\r\nSo Kuan Yü wrote a formal undertaking and gave the document to\r\nKʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“What happens if Tsʻao Tsʻao does not pass that way?” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“I will give you a written engagement that he will pass.” Then he\r\ncontinued, “On the hills by the Huayung Valley you are to raise a heap\r\nof wood and grass to make a great column of smoke and mislead Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao into coming.”\r\n\r\n“If Tsʻao Tsʻao sees a smoke he will suspect an ambush and will not\r\ncome.” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“You are very simple,” said Kʻung-ming. “Do you not know more of war’s\r\nruses than that? Tsʻao Tsʻao is an able leader but you can deceive him\r\nthis time. When he sees the smoke he will take it as a subterfuge and\r\nrisk going that way. But do not let your kindness of heart rule your\r\nconduct.”\r\n\r\nThus was his duty assigned Kuan Yü and he left, taking his adopted son,\r\nPʻing, Chou Tsʻang and a half company of swordsmen.\r\n\r\nSaid Liu Pei, “His sense of rectitude is very profound; I fear if Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao should come that way that my brother will let him pass.”\r\n\r\n“I have consulted the stars and Tsʻao the rebel is not fated to come to\r\nhis end yet. I have purposely designed this manifestation of kindly\r\nfeeling for Kuan Yü to accomplish and so act handsomely.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed there are few such far-seeing men as you are,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nThe two then went to Fankʻou whence they might watch Chou Yü’s\r\nevolutions. Sun Chʻüan and Chien Yung were left on guard.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was in his great camp in conference with his advisers and\r\nawaiting the arrival of Huang Kai. The south-east wind was very strong\r\nthat day and Chʻêng Yü was insisting on the necessity for precaution.\r\nBut Tsʻao laughed saying, “The Winter Solstice depends upon the sun and\r\nnothing else; there is sure to be a south wind at some one or other of\r\nits recurrences. I see nothing to wonder at.”\r\n\r\nJust then they announced the arrival of a small boat from the other\r\nshore with a letter from Huang Kai. The bearer of the letter was\r\nbrought in and presented it. It stated that Chou Yü had kept such\r\nstrict watch that there had been no chance of escape. But now some\r\ngrain was coming down river and Huang Kai had been named as escort\r\ncommander, which would give him the opportunity he desired. He would\r\nslay one of the known captains and bring his head as an offering when\r\nhe came. That evening at the third watch, if boats were seen with\r\ndragon toothed flags, they would be the grain boats.\r\n\r\nThis letter delighted Tsʻao Tsʻao who, with his officers, went to the\r\nnaval camp and boarded a great ship to watch for the arrival of Huang\r\nKai.\r\n\r\nIn Chiangtung, when evening fell, Chou Yü sent for Tsʻao Ho and bade\r\nthe soldiers bind him. The unhappy man protested that he had committed\r\nno crime but Chou Yü said, “What sort of a fellow are you, think you,\r\nto come and pretend to desert to my side? I need a small sacrifice for\r\nmy flag and your head will serve my purpose. So I am going to us it.”\r\n\r\nTsʻai Ho being at the end of his tether unable to deny the charge\r\nsuddenly cried, “Two of your own side, Kʻan Tsê and Kan Ning, are also\r\nin the plot!”\r\n\r\n“Under my directions,” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nTsʻai Ho was exceedingly repentant and sad, but Chou Yü bade them take\r\nhim to the river bank where the black standard had been set up and\r\nthere, after the pouring of a libation and the burning of paper, he was\r\nbeheaded, his blood being a sacrifice to the flag.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony over the ships started and Huang Kai took his place on\r\nthe third ship. He merely wore breast armour and carried a keen blade.\r\nOn his flag were written four large characters “Van Leader Huang Kai”.\r\nWith a fair wind his fleet sailed toward Chʻihpʻi, or Red Wall.\r\n\r\nThe wind was strong and the waves ran high. Tsʻao Tsʻao in the midst of\r\nthe central squadron eagerly scanned the river which rolled down under\r\nthe bright moon like a silver serpent writhing in innumerable folds.\r\nLetting the wind blow full in his face Tsʻao Tsʻao laughed aloud for\r\nwas he not now to obtain his desire?\r\n\r\nThen a soldier pointing to the river said, “The whole south is one mass\r\nof sails and they are coming up on the wind.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao went to a higher point and gazed at the sails intently and\r\nhis men told him that the flags were black and dragon shaped, and\r\nindented, and among them there flew one very large banner on which was\r\na name Huang Kai.\r\n\r\n“That is my friend the deserter,” said he joyfully. “Heaven is on my\r\nside to-day.”\r\n\r\nAs the ships drew closer Chʻêng Yü said, “Those ships are treacherous.\r\nDo not let them approach the camp.”\r\n\r\n“How know you that?” asked Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nAnd Chʻêng Yü replied, “If they were laden with grain they would lie\r\ndeep in the water. But these are light and float easily. The south-east\r\nwind is very strong and if they intend treachery, how can we defend\r\nourselves?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao began to understand. Then he asked who would go out to stop\r\nthem, and Wên Pʻing volunteered. “I am well used to the waters,” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nThereupon he sprang into a small light craft and sailed out, followed\r\nby a half score cruisers which came at his signal. Standing in the prow\r\nof his ship he called out to those advancing toward them, “You southern\r\nships are not to approach; such are the orders of the Minister. Stop\r\nthere in mid stream.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers all yelled to them to lower their sails. The shout had not\r\ndied away when a bowstring twanged and Wên Pʻing rolled down into the\r\nship with an arrow in the left arm. Confusion reigned on his ship and\r\nall the others harried back to their camp.\r\n\r\nWhen the ships were about a couple of li distant, Huang Kai waved his\r\nsword and the leading ships broke forth into fire, which, under the\r\nforce of the strong wind, soon gained strength and the ships became as\r\nfiery arrows. Soon the whole twenty dashed into the naval camp.\r\n\r\nAll Tsʻao Tsʻao’s ships were gathered there and as they wore firmly\r\nchained together not one could escape from the others and flee. There\r\nwas a roar of bombs and fireships came on from all sides at once. The\r\nface of the three rivers was speedily covered with fire which flew\r\nbefore the wind from one ship to another. It seemed as if the universe\r\nwas filled with flame.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao hastened toward the shore. Huang Kai, with a few men at his\r\nback, leaped into a small boat, dashed through the fire and sought\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao. He, seeing the imminence of the danger, was making for the\r\nland, Chang Liao got hold of a small boat into which he helped his\r\nmaster; none too soon, for the ship was burning. They got Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nout of the thick of the fire and dashed for the bank.\r\n\r\nHuang Kai seeing a handsomely robed person get into a small boat\r\nguessed it must be Tsʻao Tsʻao and pursued. He drew very near and he\r\nheld his keen blade ready to strike, crying out, “You rebel! do not\r\nflee. I am Huang Kai.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao howled in the bitterness of his distress. Chang Liao fitted\r\nan arrow to his bow and aimed at the pursuer, shooting at short range.\r\nThe roaring of the gale and the flames kept Huang Kai from hearing the\r\ntwang of the string and he was wounded in the shoulder. He fell and\r\nrolled over into the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n        He fell in peril of water\r\n        When flames were high;\r\n        Ere cudgel bruises had faded,\r\n        An arrow struck.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuang Kai’s fate will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nCHUKO LIANG FORESEES THE HUAYUNG EPISODE:\r\nKUAN YÜN-CHʻANG RELEASES TSʻAO TSʻAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter closed with Huang Kai in the water wounded, Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao rescued from immediate danger and confusion rampant among the\r\nsoldiers. Pressing forward to attack the naval camp Han Tang was told\r\nby his soldiers that some one was clinging to the rudder of his boat\r\nand shouting to him by his familiar name. Han Tang listened carefully\r\nand in the voice at once he recognised that Huang Kai was calling to\r\nhim for help.\r\n\r\n“That is my friend Huang Kai,” cried he and they quickly pulled the\r\nwounded leader out of the water. Then they saw Huang Kai was wounded\r\nfor the arrow still stuck. Han bit out the shaft of the arrow but the\r\npoint was deeply buried in the flesh. They hastily pulled off his wet\r\ngarments and cut out the metal arrowhead with a dagger, tore up one of\r\nthe flags and bound up the wound. Then Han Tang gave his friend his own\r\nfighting robe to put on and sent him off in a small boat back to camp.\r\n\r\nHuang Kai’s escape from drowning must be taken as proof of his natural\r\naffinity for, or sympathy with, water. Although it was the period of\r\ngreat cold and he was heavy with armour when he fell into the river yet\r\nhe escaped with life.\r\n\r\nIn this great battle at the junction of the rivers, when fire seemed to\r\nspread wide over all the wide surface of the water, when the earth\r\nquaked with the roar of battle, when land forces closed in on both\r\nwings and four battle squadrons advanced on the front, when the\r\nferocity of fire answered the clash of weapons and weapons were aided\r\nby fire, under the thrusts of spears and the flights of arrows, burnt\r\nby fire and drowned by water, Tsʻao Tsʻao lost an incalculable number\r\nof men. And a poet wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        When Wei and Wu together strove\r\n            For the mastery,\r\n        In Red Cliff fight the towering ships\r\n            Vanished from the sea,\r\n        For there the fierce flames, leaping high,\r\n            Burned them utterly.\r\n        So Chou Yü for his liege lord\r\n            Got the victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd another Poem runs:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        The hills are high, the moon shines faint,\r\n            The waters stretch afar;\r\n        I sigh to think how oft this land\r\n            Has suffered stress of war;\r\n        And I recall how southerners\r\n            Shrank from the northmen’s might,\r\n        And how a favouring eastern gale\r\n            Helped them to win the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving for a while the story of the slaughter on the river it is time\r\nto follow Kan Ning. He made Tsʻao Chung guide him into the innermost\r\nrecesses of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s camp. Then he slew him with one slash of his\r\nsword. After this he set fire to the jungle, and at this signal Lü Mêng\r\nput fire to the grass in half a score places near to each other. Then\r\nother fires were started, and the noise of battle was on all sides.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao and the faithful Chang Liao, with a small party of\r\nhorsemen, fled through the burning forest. They could see no road in\r\nfront; all seemed on fire. Presently Mao Chieh and Wên Pʻing, with a\r\nfew more horsemen, joined them. Tsʻao Tsʻao bade the soldiers seek a\r\nway through. Chang Liao pointed out that the only suitable road was\r\nthrough the “Black” Forest and they took it.\r\n\r\nThey had gone but a short distance when they were overtaken by a small\r\nparty of the enemy and a voice cried, “Tsʻao Tsʻao, stop!” It was Lü\r\nMêng, whose ensign soon appeared against the fiery background. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao urged his small party of fugitives forward bidding Chang Liao\r\ndefend him from Lü Mêng. Soon after he saw the light of torches in\r\nfront and from a gorge there rushed out another force. And the leader\r\ncried “Ling Tʻung is here!”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was scared; his liver and gall both seemed torn from\r\nwithin. But just then on his half right he saw another company approach\r\nand heard a friendly cry “Fear not, O Minister, I am here to rescue\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Hsü Huang and he attacked the pursuers.\r\n\r\nA move to the north seemed to promise escape, but soon they saw a camp\r\non a hill top. Hsü Huang went ahead to reconnoitre and found the\r\nofficers in command were Ma Yen and Chang I, who had once been in the\r\nservice of Yüan Shao. They had three companies of northern men in camp.\r\nThey had seen the sky redden with the flames, but knew not what was\r\nafoot so dared make no move.\r\n\r\nThis turned out lucky for Tsʻao Tsʻao who now found himself with a\r\nfresh force. He sent these two, with a company, to clear the road ahead\r\nwhile the others remained as guard. And he felt much more secure.\r\n\r\nThe two went forward, but before they had gone very far they heard a\r\nshouting and a party of soldiers came out, the leader of them shouting,\r\n“I am Kan Hsing-pa of the land of Wu.” Nothing daunted the two leaders\r\nwould engage, but the redoubtable Kan Ning cut down Ma Yen, and when\r\nhis brother warrior Chang I set his spear and dashed forward, he too\r\nfell beneath a stroke from the fearsome sword. Both leaders dead, the\r\nsoldiers fled to give Tsʻao Tsʻao the bad news.\r\n\r\nAt this time Tsʻao Tsʻao expected aid from Hofei for he knew not that\r\nSun Chʻüan was barring the road. But when Sun saw the fires and so knew\r\nthat his men had won the day he ordered Lu Hsün to give the answering\r\nsignal. Tʻaishih Tzŭ seeing this came down and his force joined up with\r\nthat of Lu Hsün and they went against Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nAs for Tsʻao Tsʻao he could only get away toward Iling. On the road he\r\nfell in with Chang Ho and ordered him to protect the retreat. He\r\npressed on as quickly as possible. At the fifth watch he was a long way\r\nfrom the glare and he felt safer. He asked the name of the place where\r\nthey were. They told him it was west of the “Black” Forest and north of\r\nItu. Seeing the thickly crowded trees all about him, and the steep\r\nhills and narrow passes, he threw up his head and laughed. Those about\r\nhim asked why he was merry and he said he was only laughing at the\r\nstupidity of Chou Yü and the ignorance of Chuko Liang. If they had only\r\nset an ambush there, as he would have done, why, there was no escape.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely finished his explanation when from both sides came a\r\ndeafening roll of drums and flames sprang up to heaven. Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nnearly fell off his horse, he was so startled. And from the side dashed\r\nin a troop, with Chao Yün leading, who cried, “I am Chao Tzŭ-lung and\r\nlong have I been waiting here.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao ordered Hsü Huang and Chang Ho to engage this new opponent\r\nand he himself rode off into the smoke and fire. Chao Yün did not\r\npursue; he only captured his banners and Tsʻao Tsʻao escaped.\r\n\r\nThe faint light of dawn showed a great black cloud all around, for the\r\nsouth-east wind had not ceased. Suddenly began a heavy down-pour of\r\nrain, wetting every one to the skin, but still Tsʻao Tsʻao maintained\r\nhis headlong flight till the starved faces of the men made a halt\r\nimperative. He told the men to forage in the villages about for grain\r\nand the means of making a fire. But when these had been found and they\r\nbegan to cook a meal another pursuing party came along and Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nagain was terrified. However, these proved to be friends escorting some\r\nof his advisers whom he saw with joy.\r\n\r\nWhen giving the order to advance again he asked what places lay ahead,\r\nand they told him there were two roads; one was the highway to South\r\nIling and the other a mountain road to the north of Iling.\r\n\r\n“Which is the shorter way to Chiangling?” asked Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“The best way is to take the south road through Hulukʻou,” was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nSo he gave orders to march that way. By the time Hulukʻou was reached\r\nthe men were almost starving and could march no more; horses too were\r\nworn out. Many had fallen by the roadside. A halt was then made, food\r\nwas taken by force from the villagers, and as there were still some\r\nboilers left they found a dry spot beside the hills where they could\r\nrest and cook. And there they began to prepare a meal, boiling grain\r\nand roasting strips of horse-flesh. Then they took off their wet\r\nclothes and spread them to dry. The beasts, too, were unsaddled and\r\nturned out to graze.\r\n\r\nSeated comfortably in a somewhat open spot Tsʻao Tsʻao suddenly looked\r\nup and began to laugh loud and long. His companions, remembering the\r\nsequel of his last laugh, said, “Not long since, Sir, you laughed at\r\nChou Yü and Chuko Liang; that resulted in the arrival of Chao Yün and\r\ngreat loss of men to us. Why do you now laugh?”\r\n\r\n“I am laughing again at the ignorance of the same two men. If I was in\r\ntheir place, and conducting their campaign, I should have had an ambush\r\nhere, just to meet us when we were tired out. Then, even if we escaped\r\nwith our lives, we should suffer very severely. They did not see this\r\nand therefore I am laughing at them.”\r\n\r\nEven at that moment behind them rose a great yell. Thoroughly startled,\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao threw aside his breastplate and leaped upon his horse. Most\r\nof the soldiers failed to catch theirs and then fires sprang up on\r\nevery side and filled the mouth of the valley. A force was arrayed\r\nbefore them and at the head was the man of Yen, Chang Fei, seated on\r\nhis steed with his great spear levelled.\r\n\r\n“Whither wouldst thou flee, O rebel?” shouted he.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers grew cold within at the sight of the terrible warrior. Hsü\r\nChʻu, mounted on a barebacked horse, rode up to engage him and two\r\ncomrades galloped up to his aid. The three gathered about Chang Fei and\r\na mêlée began, while Tsʻao Tsʻao made off at top speed. The other\r\nleaders set off after him and Chang Fei pursued. However, Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nby dint of hard riding got away and gradually the pursuers were\r\nout-distanced.\r\n\r\nBut many had received wounds. As they were going the soldiers said,\r\n“There are two roads before us; which shall we take?”\r\n\r\n“Which is the shorter?” asked Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“The high road is the more level, but it is fifty li longer than the\r\nbye-road which goes to Huayungtao. Only the latter road is narrow and\r\ndangerous, full of pits and difficult.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao sent men up to the hill tops to look around. They returned\r\nsaying there were several columns of smoke rising from the hills along\r\nthe road. The high road seemed quiet.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao bade them lead the way along the bye-road.\r\n\r\n“Where smoke arises there are surely soldiers,” remarked the officers.\r\n“Why go this way?”\r\n\r\n“Because the Book of War says that the hollow is to be regarded as\r\nsolid and the solid as hollow. That fellow Chuko Liang is very subtle\r\nand has sent men to make those fires so that we should not go that way.\r\nHe has laid an ambush on the high road. I have made up my mind and I\r\nwill not fall a victim to his wiles.”\r\n\r\n“O Minister, your conclusions are most admirable. None other can equal\r\nyou,” said the officers.\r\n\r\nAnd the soldiers were sent along the highway. They were very hungry and\r\nmany almost too weak to travel. The horses too were spent. Some had\r\nbeen scorched by the flames and they rode forward resting their heads\r\non their whips; the wounded struggled on to the last of their strength.\r\nAll were soaking wet and all were feeble. Their arms and accoutrements\r\nwere in a deplorable state, and more than half had been left upon the\r\nroad they had traversed. Few of the horses had saddles or bridles, for\r\nin the confusion of pursuit they had been left behind. It was the time\r\nof greatest winter cold and the suffering was indescribable.\r\n\r\nNoticing that the leading party had stopped Tsʻao Tsʻao sent to ask the\r\nreason. The messenger returned to report that by reason of the rain\r\nwater collected in the pits and the mire the horses could not move.\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao raged.\r\n\r\nHe said, “When soldiers come to hills they cut a road, when they happen\r\nupon streams they bridge them; such a thing as mud cannot stay an\r\narmy.”\r\n\r\nSo he ordered the weak and wounded to go to the rear and come on as\r\nthey could, while the robust and able were to cut down trees, and\r\ngather herbage and reeds to fill up the holes. And it was to be done\r\nwithout delay, or death would be the punishment of the disobedient or\r\nremiss.\r\n\r\nSo the men dismounted and felled trees and cut bamboos, and they\r\nlevelled the road. And because of the imminence and fear of pursuit a\r\nparty was told off to hasten the workers and slay any that idled.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers made their way along the shallower parts, but many fell,\r\nand cries of misery were heard the whole length of the way.\r\n\r\n“What are you howling for?” cried Tsʻao Tsʻao. “The number of your days\r\nis fixed. Any one who howls shall be put to death.”\r\n\r\nThe remnant of the army, now divided into three, one to march slowly, a\r\nsecond to fill up the waterways and hollows and a third to escort Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, gradually made its way over the precipitous road. When the going\r\nimproved a little and the path was moderately level, Tsʻao Tsʻao turned\r\nto look at his following and saw he had barely three hundred men. And\r\nthese lacked clothing and armour and were tattered and disordered.\r\n\r\nBut he pressed on, and when the officers told him the horses were quite\r\nspent and must rest, he replied, “Press on to Chingchou and there we\r\nshall find repose.”\r\n\r\nSo they pressed on. But they had gone only a few li when Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nflourished his whip and broke once again into loud laughter.\r\n\r\n“What is there to laugh at?” asked the officers.\r\n\r\n“People say those two are able and crafty; I do not see it. They are a\r\ncouple of incapables. If an ambush had been placed here we should all\r\nbe prisoners.”\r\n\r\nHe had not finished this speech when the explosion of a bomb broke the\r\nsilence and a half company of men with swords in their hands appeared\r\nand barred the way. The leader was Kuan Yü holding the famous Black\r\nDragon sword, bestriding the “Red Hare” steed. At this sight the\r\nspirits of the soldiers left them and they gazed into each others’\r\nfaces in panic.\r\n\r\n“Now we have but one course;” said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “we must fight to the\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n“How can we?” said the officers. “The men are scared, the horses are\r\nspent.”\r\n\r\nChʻêng Yü said, “I have always heard that Kuan Yü is haughty to the\r\nproud but kindly to the humble; he despises the strong, but is gentle\r\nwith the weak. He discriminates between love and hate and is always\r\nrighteous and true. You, O Minister, have shown him kindness, and if\r\nyou will remind him of that we shall escape this evil.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao agreed to try. He rode out to the front, bowed low and\r\nsaid, “General, I trust you have enjoyed good health.”\r\n\r\n“I had orders to await you, O Minister,” replied he, bowing in return,\r\n“and I have been expecting you these many days.”\r\n\r\n“You see before you Tsʻao Tsʻao, defeated and weak. I have reached a\r\nsad pass and I trust you, O General, will not forget the kindness of\r\nformer days.”\r\n\r\n“Though indeed you were kind to me in those days, yet I slew your\r\nenemies for you and relieved the siege of Paima. As to the business of\r\nto-day, I cannot allow private feelings to outweigh public duty.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember my generals, slain at the five passes? The noble man\r\nvalues righteousness. You are well versed in the histories and must\r\nrecall the action of Yu-kung, the archer, when he found his master\r\nTzŭ-cho in his power.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was indeed a very mountain of goodness and could not forget the\r\ngreat kindness he had received at Tsʻao Tsʻao’s hands, and the\r\nmagnanimity he had shown over the deeds at the five passes. He saw the\r\ndesperate straits to which his benefactor was reduced and tears were\r\nvery near to the eyes of both. He could not press him hard. He pulled\r\nat the bridle of his steed and turned away saying to his followers,\r\n“Break up the formation.”\r\n\r\nFrom this it was evident that his design was to release Tsʻao Tsʻao,\r\nwho then went on with his officers, and when Kuan Yü turned to look\r\nback they had all passed. He uttered a great shout and the soldiers\r\njumped off their horses and knelt on the ground crying for mercy. But\r\nhe also had pity for them. Then Chang Liao, whom he knew well, came\r\nalong and was allowed to go free also.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tsʻao Tsʻao, his army lost, fled to the Huayung Valley;\r\n    There in the throat of the gorge met he Kuan Yü.\r\n    Grateful was Kuan, and mindful of former kindness,\r\n    Wherefore slipped he the bolt and freed the imprisoned dragon.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving escaped this danger Tsʻao Tsʻao hastened to get out of the\r\nvalley. As the throat opened out he glanced behind him and saw only two\r\nscore and seven horsemen. As evening fell they reached Nanchün and they\r\ncame upon what they took to be more enemies. Tsʻao Tsʻao thought the\r\nend had surely come, but to his delight they were his own men and he\r\nregained all his confidence. Tsʻao Jên, who was the leader, said that\r\nhe had heard of the misfortunes of his master, but he was afraid to\r\nventure far from his charge else he would have met him before.\r\n\r\n“I nearly missed you as it was,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives found repose in the city, where Chang Liao soon joined\r\nthem. He also praised the magnanimity of Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao mustered the miserable remnant of his host he found\r\nnearly all were wounded and he bade them rest. Tsʻao Jên poured the\r\nwine of consolation whereby his master might forget his sorrows. And as\r\nTsʻao drank among his familiars he became exceedingly sad.\r\n\r\nWherefore they said, “O Minister, when you were in the cave of the\r\ntiger and trying to escape you showed no sign of sorrow; now that you\r\nare safe in a city, where you have food and the horses have forage,\r\nwhere all you have to do is to prepare for revenge, suddenly you lose\r\nheart and grieve; why thus?”\r\n\r\nReplied Tsʻao Tsʻao, “I am thinking of my friend Kuo Chia; had he been\r\nalive he would not have let me suffer this loss.”\r\n\r\nHe beat his breast and wept, saying “Alas for Fêng-hsiao! I grieve for\r\nFêng-hsiao! I sorrow for Fêng-hsiao!”\r\n\r\nThe reproach shamed the advisers. Next day Tsʻao Tsʻao called Tsʻao Jên\r\nand said, “I am going to the capital to prepare another army for\r\nrevenge. You are to guard this district and, in case of necessity, I\r\nleave with you a sealed plan. You are only to open the cover when\r\nhard-pressed, and then you are to act as directed. Wu will not dare to\r\nlook this way.”\r\n\r\n“Who is to guard Hofei and Hsiangyang?”\r\n\r\n“Chingchou is particularly your care and Hsiahou Tun is to hold\r\nHsiangyang. As Hofei is most important I am sending Chang Liao thither\r\nwith good aids. If you get into difficulties send at once to tell me.”\r\n\r\nHaving made these dispositions Tsʻao Tsʻao set off at once with a few\r\nfollowers. He took with him the officers who had come over to his side\r\nwhen Chingchou fell into his hands.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên placed Tsʻao Hung in charge of the south of Iling.\r\n\r\nAfter having allowed the escape of Tsʻao Tsʻao, Kuan Yü found his way\r\nback to headquarters. By this time the other detachments had returned\r\nbringing spoil of horses and weapons and supplies of all kinds. Only\r\nKuan Yü came back empty-handed. When he arrived Chuko Liang was with\r\nhis brother congratulating him on his success. When Kuan Yü was\r\nannounced Kʻung-ming got up and went to welcome him, bearing a cup of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n“Joy! O General,” said he. “You have done a deed that overtops the\r\nworld. You have removed the country’s worst foe and ought to have been\r\nmet at a distance and felicitated.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü muttered inaudibly and Kʻung-ming continued, “I hope it is not\r\nbecause we have omitted to welcome you on the road that you seem sad.”\r\n\r\nTurning to those about him he said, “Why did you not tell us he was\r\ncoming?”\r\n\r\n“I am here to ask for death,” said Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\n“Surely Tsʻao Tsʻao came through the valley?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he came that way, and I could not help it; I let him go.”\r\n\r\n“Then whom have you captured?”\r\n\r\n“No one.”\r\n\r\n“Then you remembered the old kindness of Tsʻao Tsʻao and so allowed him\r\nto escape. But your acceptance of the task with its conditions is here.\r\nYou will have to suffer the penalty.”\r\n\r\nHe called in the lictors and told them to take away Kuan Yü and put him\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Kuan Yü risked life when he spared Tsʻao\r\n           In direst need,\r\n        And age-long admiration gained\r\n           For kindly deed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat actually befell will be seen in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nA GREAT BATTLE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH:\r\nKʻUNG-MING ANGERS CHOU YÜ.\r\n\r\n\r\nKuan Yü had died there but for his elder brother, who said to the great\r\nstrategist, “We three pledged ourselves to live and die together.\r\nAlthough my brother Yün-chʻang has offended I cannot bear to break our\r\noath. I hope you will only record this against him and let him atone\r\nlater for the fault by some specially meritorious service.”\r\n\r\nSo the sentence was remitted. In the meantime Chou Yü mustered his\r\nofficers and called over his men, noted the special services of each\r\nand sent full reports to his master. The soldiers who had surrendered\r\nwere all transported across the river. All this done they spread the\r\nfeast of victory.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to attack and capture Nanchün. The van of the army\r\ncamped on the river bank. There were five camps and the general’s tent\r\nwas in the centre. He summoned his officers to a council. At this\r\nmoment Sun Chʻien arrived with congratulations from Liu Pei. Chou Yü\r\nreceived him and, having saluted in proper form, Chʻien said, “My lord\r\nsent me on this special mission to felicitate the General on his great\r\nvirtue and offer some unworthy gifts.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Yüan-tê?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“He is now encamped at Yuchiangkʻou.”\r\n\r\n“Is Kʻung-ming there?” asked Chou Yü, taken aback.\r\n\r\n“Both are there,” said Chʻien.\r\n\r\n“Then return quickly, and I will come in person to thank them.”\r\n\r\nThe presents handed over, Sun Chʻien was sent back forthwith to his own\r\ncamp. Then Lu Su asked Chou Yü why he had started when he heard where\r\nLiu Pei was camped.\r\n\r\n“Because,” replied Chou Yü, “camping there means that he has the\r\nintention of taking Nanchün. Having spent much military energy and\r\nspared no expenditure, we thought the district should fall to us\r\neasily. Those others are opposed to us and they wish to get the\r\nadvantage of what we have already accomplished. However, they must\r\nremember that I am not dead yet.”\r\n\r\n“How can you prevent them?” asked Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“I will go myself and speak with them. If all goes well, then, let it\r\nbe so; in case it does not, then I shall immediately settle up Liu Pei\r\nwithout waiting for Nanchün to be taken.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to accompany you,” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\nThe General and his friend started, taking with them a guard of one\r\nsquadron of light horse. Having arrived at Yuchiangkʻou they sought out\r\nSun Chʻien, who, in turn, went in to see Yüan-tê and told him Chou Yü\r\nhad come to render thanks.\r\n\r\n“Why has he come?” asked Yüan-tê of his all-wise adviser.\r\n\r\n“Is it likely he would come out of simple politeness? Of course he has\r\ncome in connection with Nanchün.”\r\n\r\n“But if he brings an army, can we stand against it?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“When he comes you may reply thus and thus.”\r\n\r\nThen they drew up the warships in the river and ranged the soldiers\r\nupon the bank and when the arrival of Chou Yü was formally announced,\r\nChao Yün, with some horsemen, went to welcome him. When Chou Yü saw\r\nwhat bold men they looked he began to feel uncomfortable, but he went\r\non his way. Being met at the camp gates by Liu Pei and Kʻung-ming, he\r\nwas taken in to the chief tent, where the ceremonies were performed and\r\npreparations for a banquet had been made.\r\n\r\nPresently Liu Pei raised his cup in felicitation on the recent victory\r\ngained by his guest. The banquet proceeded and after a few more courses\r\nChou Yü said, “Of course you are camped here with no other idea than to\r\ntake Nanchün?”\r\n\r\n“We heard you were going to take the place and came to assist. Should\r\nyou not take it then we will occupy it.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü laughed. “We of the east have long wished for this district.\r\nNow that it is within our grasp we naturally shall take it.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei said, “There is always some uncertainty. Tsʻao Tsʻao left Tsʻao\r\nJên to guard the district and you may be certain that there is good\r\nstrategy behind him to say nothing of his boldness as a warrior. I fear\r\nyou may not get it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if we do not take it then, Sir, you may have it,” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Here are witnesses to your words,” said Liu Pei, naming those at\r\ntable. “I hope you will never repent what you have just said.”\r\n\r\nLu Su stammered and seemed unwilling to be cited as one of the\r\nwitnesses but Chou Yü said, “When the word of a noble man has gone\r\nforth it is ended; he never regrets.”\r\n\r\n“This speech of yours, Sir, is very generous,” interjected Kʻung-ming.\r\n“Wu shall try first, but if the place does not fall there is no reason\r\nwhy my lord should not capture it.”\r\n\r\nThe two visitors then took their leave and rode away. As soon as they\r\nhad left Liu Pei turned to Kʻung-ming and said, “O Master, you bade me\r\nthus reply to Chou Yü, but though I did so I have turned it over and\r\nover in my mind without finding any reason in what I said. I am alone\r\nand weak, without a single foot of land to call my own. I desired to\r\nget possession of Nanchün that I might have, at least, a temporary\r\nshelter, yet I have said that Chou Yü may attack it first and if it\r\nfall to Wu, how can I get possession?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming laughed and replied, “First I advised you to attack\r\nChingchou, but you would not listen; do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“But it belonged to Liu Piao and I could not bear to attack it then.\r\nNow it belongs to Tsʻao Tsʻao I might do so.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be anxious,” replied the adviser. “Let Chou Yü go and attack\r\nit; some day, my lord, I shall make you sit in the high places\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\n“But what design have you?”\r\n\r\n“So and so,” replied Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was satisfied with the reply, and only strengthened his\r\nposition at Chiangkʻou. In the meantime Chou Yü and Lu Su returned to\r\ntheir own camp and the latter said, “Why did you tell Liu Pei that he\r\nmight attack Nanchün?”\r\n\r\n“I can take it with a flick of my finger,” replied Chou Yü, “but I just\r\nmanifested a little pretended kindliness.”\r\n\r\nThen he enquired among his officers for a volunteer to attack the city.\r\nOne Chiang Chʻin offered himself, and was put in command of the\r\nvanguard, with Hsü Shêng and Ting Fêng as helpers. He was given five\r\ncompanies of veterans and they moved across the river. Chou Yü promised\r\nto follow with supports.\r\n\r\nOn the other side Tsʻao Jên ordered Tsʻao Hung to guard Iling and so\r\nhold one corner of a triangular defence. When the news came that Wu had\r\ncrossed the river Han, Tsʻao said, “We will defend and not offer\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\nBut Niu Chin said impetuously, “To let the enemy approach the walls and\r\nnot offer battle is timidity. Our men, lately worsted, need heartening\r\nand must show their mettle. Let me have half a company of veterans and\r\nI will fight to a finish.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên could not withstand this offer and so the half company went\r\nout of the city. At once Ting Fêng came to challenge the leader and\r\nthey fought a few bouts. Then Ting Fêng pretended to be defeated, gave\r\nup the fight and retreated into his own lines. Niu Chin followed him\r\nhard. When he had got within the Wu formation, at a signal from Ting\r\nFêng, the army closed round and Niu Chin was surrounded. He pushed\r\nright and left, but could find no way out. Seeing him in the toils,\r\nTsʻao Jên, who had watched the fight from the wall, donned his armour\r\nand came out of the city at the head of his own bold company of\r\nhorsemen and burst in among the men of Wu to try to rescue his\r\ncolleague. Beating back Hsü Shêng he fought his way in and presently\r\nrescued Niu Chin.\r\n\r\nHowever, having got out he saw several score of horsemen still in the\r\nmiddle unable to make their way out, whereupon he turned again to the\r\nbattle and dashed in to their rescue. This time he met Chiang Chʻin on\r\nwhom he and Niu Chin made a violent onslaught. Then the brother Tsʻao\r\nShun came up with supports and the great battle ended in a defeat for\r\nthe men of Wu.\r\n\r\nSo Tsʻao Jên went back victor, while the unhappy Chiang Chʻin returned\r\nto report his failure. Chou Yü was very angry and would have put to\r\ndeath his hapless subordinate but for the intervention of the other\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThen he prepared for another attack where he himself would lead. But\r\nKan Ning said, “General, do not be in too great hurry; let me go first\r\nand attack Iling, the supporting angle of the triangle. After that the\r\nconquest of Nanchün will be easy.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü accepted the plan and Kan, with three companies, went to attack\r\nIling.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the approaching army reached him Tsʻao Jên called to his\r\nside Chʻên Chiao, who said, “If Iling be lost then Nanchün is lost too.\r\nSo help must be sent quickly.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Tsʻao Shun and Niu Chin were sent by secret ways to the aid\r\nof Tsʻao Hung. Tsʻao Shun sent a messenger to the city to ask that they\r\nshould cause a diversion by a sortie at the time the reinforcements\r\nshould arrive.\r\n\r\nSo when Kan Ning drew near, Tsʻao Hung went out to meet and engage him.\r\nThey fought a score of rounds, but Tsʻao Hung was overcome at last and\r\nKan Ning took the city. However, as evening fell the reinforcements\r\ncame up and the captor was surrounded in the city he had taken. The\r\nscouts went off immediately to tell Chou Yü of this sudden change of\r\naffairs which greatly alarmed him.\r\n\r\n“Let us hasten to his rescue,” said Chʻêng Pʻu.\r\n\r\n“This place is of the greatest importance,” said Chou Yü, “and I am\r\nafraid to leave it undefended lest Tsʻao Jên should attack.”\r\n\r\n“But he is one of our first leaders and must be rescued,” said Lü Mêng.\r\n\r\n“I should like to go myself to his aid, but whom can I leave here in my\r\nplace?” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Leave Lin Tʻung here,” said Lü Mêng; “I will push on ahead and you can\r\nprotect my advance. In less than ten days we shall be singing the pæan\r\nof victory.”\r\n\r\n“Are you willing?” said Chou Yü to the man who was to act for him.\r\n\r\n“If the ten day period is not exceeded I may be able to carry on for\r\nthat time; I am unequal to more than that.”\r\n\r\nLing Tʻung’s consent pleased Chou Yü who started at once, leaving a\r\nlegion for the defence of the camp. Lü Mêng said to his chief, “South\r\nof Iling is a little-used road that may prove very useful in an attack\r\non Nanchün. Let us send a party to fell trees and barricade this road\r\nso that horses cannot pass. In case of defeat the defeated will take\r\nthis road and will be compelled to abandon their horses, which we shall\r\ncapture.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü approved and the men set out. When the main army drew near\r\nIling, Chou Yü asked who would try to break through the besiegers and\r\nChou Tʻai offered himself. He girded on his sword, mounted his steed\r\nand burst straight into the Tsʻao army. He got through to the city\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nFrom the city wall Kan Ning saw the approach of his friend Chou Tʻai\r\nand went out to welcome him. Chou Tʻai told him that the\r\nCommander-in-Chief was on the way to his relief and Kan Ning at once\r\nbade the defenders prepare from within to support the attack of the\r\nrescuers.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the approach of Chou Yü had reached Iling the\r\ndefenders had sent to tell Tsʻao Jên, who was at Nanchün and they\r\nprepared to repel the assailants. So when the army of Wu came near they\r\nwere at once attacked. Simultaneously Kan Ning and Chou Tʻai attacked\r\non two sides and the men of Tsʻao were thrown into confusion. The men\r\nof Wu fell on lustily and the three leaders all fled by a bye-road,\r\nbut, finding the way barred with felled trees and other obstacles, they\r\nhad to abandon their horses and go afoot. In this way the men of Wu\r\ngained some five hundred steeds.\r\n\r\nChou Yü, pressing on as quickly as possible toward Nanchün, came upon\r\nTsʻao Jên and his army marching to save Iling. The two armies engaged\r\nand fought a battle which lasted till late in the evening. Then both\r\ndrew off and Tsʻao Jên withdrew into the city.\r\n\r\nDuring the night he called his officers to a council. Then said Tsʻao\r\nHung, “The loss of Iling has brought us to a dangerous pass; now it\r\nseems the time to open the letter of the Minister our Chief and see\r\nwhat plans he arranged for our salvation in this peril.”\r\n\r\n“You but say what I think,” replied Tsʻao Jên. Whereupon he tore open\r\nthe letter and read it. His face lighted up with joy and he at once\r\nissued orders to have the morning meal prepared at the fifth watch. At\r\ndaylight the whole army moved out of the city but they left a semblance\r\nof occupation in the shape of banners on the walls.\r\n\r\nChou Yü went up to the tower of observation and looked over the city.\r\nHe saw that the flags along the battlements had no men behind them and\r\nhe noticed that every man carried a bundle at his waist behind so that\r\nhe was prepared for a long march. Thought Chou Yü to himself, “Tsʻao\r\nJên must be prepared for a long march.”\r\n\r\nSo he went down from the tower of observation and sent out an order for\r\ntwo wings of the army to be ready. One of these was to attack and, in\r\ncase of its success, the other was to pursue at full speed till the\r\nclanging of the gongs should call them to return. He took command of\r\nthe leading force in person and Chʻêng Pʻu commanded the other. Thus\r\nthey advanced to attack the city.\r\n\r\nThe armies being arrayed facing each other, the drums rolled out across\r\nthe plain. Tsʻao Hung rode forth and challenged, and Chou Yü, from his\r\nplace by the standard, bade Han Tang respond. The two champions fought\r\nnear two score bouts and then Tsʻao Hung fled. Thereupon Tsʻao Jên came\r\nout to help him and Chou Tʻai rode out at full speed to meet him. These\r\ntwo exchanged a half score passes and then Tsʻao Jên fled.\r\n\r\nHis army fell into confusion. Thereupon Chou Yü gave the signal for the\r\nadvance of both his wings and the men of Tsʻao were sore smitten and\r\ndefeated. Chou Yü pursued to the city wall, but Tsʻao’s men did not\r\nenter the city. Instead, they went away north-west. Han Tang and Chou\r\nTʻai pressed them hard.\r\n\r\nChou Yü, seeing the city gates standing wide open and no guards upon\r\nthe walls, ordered the raiding of the city. A few score horsemen rode\r\nin first, Chou Yü followed and whipping his steed. As he galloped into\r\nthe enclosure around the gate, Chʻên Chiao stood on the defence tower.\r\nWhen he saw Chou Yü enter, in his heart he applauded the god-like\r\nperspicacity of the Minister Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen was heard the clap-clap of a watchman’s rattle. At this signal the\r\narchers and crossbowmen let fly and the arrows and bolts flew forth in\r\na sudden fierce shower, while those who had won their way to the van of\r\nthe inrush went headlong into a deep trench. Chou Yü managed to pull up\r\nin time, but turning to escape, he was wounded in the left side and\r\nfell to the ground. Niu Chin rushed out from the city to capture the\r\nchief, but Hsü Shêng and Ting Fêng at the risk of their lives got him\r\naway safe. Then the men of Tsʻao dashed out of the city and wrought\r\nconfusion among the men of Wu, who trampled each other down and many\r\nmore fell into the trenches. Chʻêng Pʻu tried to draw off, but Tsʻao\r\nJên and Tsʻao Hung came toward him from different directions and the\r\nbattle went hardly against the men from the east, till help came from\r\nLing Tʻung, who bore back their assailants. Satisfied with their\r\nsuccess Tsʻao led his men into the city, while the losers marched back\r\nto their own camp.\r\n\r\nChou Yü, sorely wounded, was taken to his own tent and the army\r\nphysician called in. With iron forceps he extracted the sharp bolt and\r\ndressed the wound with a lotion designed to counteract the poison of\r\nthe metal. But the pain was intense and the patient rejected all\r\nnourishment. The physician said the missile had been poisoned and the\r\nwound would require a long time to heal. The patient must be kept quiet\r\nand especially free from any irritation, which would cause the wound to\r\nre-open.\r\n\r\nThereupon Chʻêng Pʻu gave orders that each division was to remain in\r\ncamp. Three days later Niu Chin came within sight and challenged the\r\nmen of Wu to battle, but they did not stir. The enemy hurled at them\r\ntaunts and insults till the sun had fallen low in the sky, but it was\r\nof no avail and Niu withdrew.\r\n\r\nNext day Niu Chin returned and repeated his insulting abuse. Chʻêng Pʻu\r\ndared not tell the wounded general. The third day, waxing bolder, the\r\nenemy came to the very gates of the stockade, the leader shouting that\r\nhe had come for the purpose of capturing Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nThen Chʻêng Pʻu called together his officers and they discussed the\r\nfeasibility of retirement into Wu that he might seek the opinion of the\r\nMarquis.\r\n\r\nIll as he was Chou Yü still retained control of the expedition. He knew\r\nthat the enemy came daily to the gates of his camp and reviled him\r\nalthough none of his officers told him. One day Tsʻao Jên came in\r\nperson and there was much rolling of drums and shouting. Chʻêng Pʻu,\r\nhowever, steadily refused to accept the challenge and would not let any\r\none go out. Then Chou Yü summoned the officers to his bedside and said,\r\n“What mean the drums and the shouting?”\r\n\r\n“The men are drilling,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Why do you deceive me?” said Chou Yü angrily. “Do I not know that our\r\nenemies come day by day to our gates and insult us? Yet Chʻêng Pʻu\r\nsuffers this in silence and makes no use of his powers and authority.”\r\n\r\nHe sent for Chʻêng Pʻu and, when he arrived, asked him why he acted\r\nthus.\r\n\r\n“Because you are ill and the physician said you were on no account to\r\nbe provoked to anger. Wherefore, although the enemy challenged us to\r\nbattle, I kept it from you.”\r\n\r\n“And if you do not fight what think you should be done?” said Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nAnd they all said they desired to return to the east till he had\r\nrecovered from his wound, when they would make another expedition.\r\n\r\nChou Yü lay and listened. Suddenly he sprang up, crying, “The noble man\r\nwho has eaten of his lord’s bounty should die in his lord’s battles; to\r\nreturn to one’s home wrapped in a horse’s hide is a happy fate. Am I\r\nthe sort of man to bring to nought the grand designs of my country?”\r\n\r\nSo speaking he proceeded to gird on his armour and he mounted his\r\nhorse. The wonder of the officers only redoubled when their General\r\nplaced himself at the head of some hundreds of horsemen and went out of\r\nthe camp gates toward the enemy, then fully arrayed. Tsʻao Jên, their\r\ngeneral, stood beneath the great standard.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the opponents Tsʻao Jên flourished his whip and began to\r\nhurl abuse at them, “Chou Yü, you babe! I think your fate has met you.\r\nYou dare not face my men.”\r\n\r\nThe stream of insult never ceased. Presently Chou Yü could stand it no\r\nlonger. Riding out to the front he cried, “Here I am, base churl; look\r\nat me!”\r\n\r\nThe whole Tsʻao army were taken aback. But Tsʻao Jên turned to those\r\nabout him and said, “Let us all revile him!” And the whole army yelled\r\ninsults.\r\n\r\nChou Yü grew angry and sent Pʻan Chang out to fight. But before he had\r\ndelivered his first blow Chou Yü suddenly uttered a loud cry, and he\r\nfell to the ground with blood gushing from his mouth.\r\n\r\nAt this the Tsʻao army rushed to the battle and the men of Wu pressed\r\nforward to meet them. A fierce struggle waged around the General’s\r\nbody, but he was borne off safely and taken to his tent.\r\n\r\n“Do you feel better?” asked Chʻêng Pʻu anxiously.\r\n\r\n“It was a ruse of mine,” whispered Chou Yü in reply.\r\n\r\n“But what avails it?”\r\n\r\n“I am not suffering, but I did that to make our enemies think I was\r\nvery ill and so oppose them by deceit. I will send a few trusty men to\r\npretend desertion and tell them I am dead. That will cause them to try\r\na night raid on the camp and we shall have an ambush ready for them. We\r\nshall get Tsʻao Jên easily.”\r\n\r\n“The plan seems excellent,” said Chʻêng Pʻu.\r\n\r\nSoon from the tent there arose the sound of wailing as for the dead.\r\nThe soldiers around took up the cry and said one to another, “The\r\nGeneral is dead of his wound,” and they all put on the symbols of\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tsʻao Jên was consulting with his officers. Said he, “Chou Yü\r\nlost his temper and that has caused his wound to re-open and brought on\r\nthat flow of blood. You saw him fall to the ground and he will\r\nassuredly die soon.”\r\n\r\nJust then there came in one who said that a few men had come over from\r\nthe enemy asking to be allowed to join the army of Tsʻao; among them\r\nwere two of Tsʻao’s men who had been made prisoners.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên sent for the deserters and questioned them. They told him a\r\nstory of Chou Yü’s wound and death that day. The leaders were all in\r\nmourning. They had deserted because they had been put to shame by the\r\nsecond in command.\r\n\r\nPleased at this news Tsʻao Jên at once began to arrange to make a night\r\nattack on the camp and, if possible, get the head of the dead general\r\nto send to the capital.\r\n\r\n“Success depends upon promptitude, so act without delay,” said Chʻên\r\nChiao.\r\n\r\nNiu Chin was told off as van leader, Tsʻao Jên himself led the centre,\r\nwhile the rear was commanded by Tsʻao Hung and Tsʻao Shun. Chʻên Chiao,\r\nand a few men, were left to guard the city.\r\n\r\nAt the first watch they left the city and took the way toward Chou Yü’s\r\ncamp. When they drew near not a man was visible, but flags and banners\r\nand spears were all there, evidently to keep up an appearance of\r\npreparation. Feeling at once that they had been tricked they turned to\r\nretreat. But a bomb exploded and this was the signal for an attack on\r\nall four sides. The result was a severe defeat for the raiders and the\r\narmy of Tsʻao Jên was entirely broken and scattered abroad so that no\r\none part of the beaten army could aid the other.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Jên, with a few horsemen got out of the press and presently met\r\nTsʻao Hung. The two leaders ran away together and by the fifth watch\r\nthey had got near Nanchün. Then they heard a beating of drums and Lin\r\nTʻung appeared barring the way. There was a small skirmish and Tsʻao\r\nJên went off at an angle. But he fell in with Kan Ning, who attacked\r\nhim vigorously. Tsʻao Jên dared not go back to Nanchün, but he made for\r\nHsiangyang along the main road. The men of Wu pursued him for a time\r\nand then desisted.\r\n\r\nChou Yü and Chʻêng Pʻu then made their way to Nanchün where they were\r\nstartled to see flags on the walls and every sign of occupation. Before\r\nthey had recovered from their surprise there appeared one who cried,\r\n“Pardon, General; I had orders from my chief to take this city. I am\r\nChao Tzŭ-lung of Chʻangshan.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü was fiercely angry and gave orders to assault the city, but the\r\ndefenders sent down flights and flights of arrows and his men could not\r\nstay near the rampart. So he withdrew and took counsel. In the meantime\r\nhe decided to send a force to capture Chingchou and another to take\r\nHsiangyang. Nanchün could be taken later.\r\n\r\nBut even as these orders were being given the scouts came in hurriedly\r\nto report that Chuko Liang, suddenly producing a military commission,\r\nhad induced the guards of Chingchou to leave it and go to the rescue of\r\nChou Yü. Whereupon Chang Fei had occupied the town. Soon after another\r\nmessenger came to say that Hsiahou Tun, at Hsiangyang, had received\r\nfrom Chuko Liang despatches, supported by a commission in due form,\r\nsaying that Tsʻao Jên was in danger and needed help, whereupon Hsiahou\r\nTun had marched off and Kuan Yü had seized that town.\r\n\r\nThus the two towns that Chou Yü wanted had fallen, without the least\r\neffort, into the hands of his rival Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“How did Chuko Liang get this military commission with which he has\r\nimposed on the captains?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nChʻêng Pʻu replied, “He seized that of Chʻên Chiao; and so has got all\r\nthis district into his power.”\r\n\r\nChou Yü uttered a great cry for at that moment his wound had suddenly\r\nburst open.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A city falls, but not to us the gain;\r\n        The guerdon is another’s; ours the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will say what befell Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nCHUKO LIANG TALKS CUNNINGLY TO LU SU:\r\nCHAO YÜN, BY A RUSE, CAPTURES KUEIYANG\r\n\r\n\r\nChou Yü’s anger at seeing that his rival, Kʻung-ming, had surprised\r\nNanchün, and at hearing the same news of Chingchou and Hsiangyang, was\r\nbut natural. And this sudden fit of rage caused his wound to re-open.\r\nHowever, he soon recovered. All his officers besought him to accept the\r\nsituation, but he said, “What but the death of that bumpkin, Chuko,\r\nwill assuage my anger? If Chʻêng Pʻu can but aid me in an attack on\r\nNanchün I can certainly restore it to my country.”\r\n\r\nSoon Lu Su came in, to whom Chou Yü said, “I simply must fight Liu Pei\r\nand Chuko Liang till it is decided which shall have the upper hand. I\r\nmust also recapture the city. Perhaps you can assist me.”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be done,” replied Lu Su. “We are now at grips with Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao and victory or defeat is undecided. Our lord has not been\r\nsuccessful in overcoming Hopei. Do not fight near home, or it will be\r\nlike people of the same household destroying each other and should\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao take advantage of this position to make a sudden descent we\r\nshould be in a parlous condition. Further, you must remember that Liu\r\nPei and Tsʻao Tsʻao are united by the bonds of old friendship and, if\r\nthe pressure becomes too great, Liu Pei may relinquish these cities,\r\noffer them to Tsʻao Tsʻao and join forces with him to attack our\r\ncountry. That would be a real misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot help being angry” said Chou Yü, “to think that we should have\r\nused our resources for their benefit. They get all the advantage.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let me go and see Yüan-tê and talk reason to him. If I can\r\narrive at no understanding then attack at once.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent proposal!” cried all present.\r\n\r\nSo Lu Su, with his escort, went away to Nanchün to carry out his\r\nproposal and try to arrange matters. He reached the city wall and\r\nsummoned the gate, whereat Chao Yün came out to speak with him.\r\n\r\n“I have something to say to Liu Yüan-tê,” said he; “I wish to see him.”\r\n\r\n“My lord and Chuko Liang are in Chingchou,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nLu Su turned away and hasted to Chingchou. He found the walls bedecked\r\nwith flags and everything in excellent order. In his heart he admired\r\nthe sight, and thought what an able man was the commander of that army.\r\n\r\nThe guards reported his arrival and Kʻung-ming ordered them to throw\r\nwide the gate. He was led to the government house and, after the usual\r\nexchange of salutes, Kʻung-ming and his visitor took their respective\r\nseats. Having finished the tea, Lu Su said, “My master, the Marquis Wu,\r\nand the Commander of his army, Chou Yü, have sent me to lay before the\r\nImperial Uncle their views. When Tsʻao Tsʻao led his huge host\r\nsouthward he gave out that it was for the conquest of Chiangnan; really\r\nhis intention was to destroy Liu Pei. Happily our army was able to\r\nrepulse that mighty host and so saved him. Wherefore Chingchou with its\r\nnine districts ought to belong to us. But by a treacherous move your\r\nmaster has occupied Chingchou and Hsiangyang, so that we have spent our\r\ntreasure in vain and our armies have fought to no purpose. The imperial\r\nUncle has reaped the benefits to the full. This is not as it should\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “Tzŭ-ching, you are a man of high intelligence; why\r\ndo you hold such language? You know the saying, that all things turn to\r\ntheir owner. These places have never belonged to Wu, but were of the\r\npatrimony of Liu Piao, and though he is dead, his son remains. Should\r\nnot the uncle assist the nephew to recover his own? Could my master\r\nhave refrained?”\r\n\r\n“If the nephew Liu Chʻi, the rightful heir, had occupied these cities\r\nthere would have been something to say. But he is at Chianghsia and not\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to see him?” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he ordered the servants to request Liu Chʻi to come.\r\nThereupon he at once appeared, supported by two attendants. Addressing\r\nLu Su he said, “I am too weak to perform the correct ceremonies; I pray\r\nyou pardon me, Tzŭ-ching.”\r\n\r\nLu Su said not a word; he was too much taken aback. However, he\r\nrecovered himself presently and said, “But if the heir had not been\r\nhere, what then?”\r\n\r\n“The heir is living but from day to day; should he go, then——there will\r\nbe something to talk about.”\r\n\r\n“Should he die, then you ought to return these cities to us.”\r\n\r\n“You state the exact facts,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nThen a banquet was prepared and, that over, Lu Su took his leave. He\r\nhastened back to his own camp and gave Chou Yü an account of his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n“But what is there for us in the chance of Liu Chʻi’s death?” said Chou\r\nYü. “He is in his very first youth. When will these places fall to us?”\r\n\r\n“Rest content, General; let me guarantee the return of these places.”\r\n\r\n“But how can you?” asked Chou Yü.\r\n\r\n“Liu Chʻi has indulged too freely in wine and women; he is a wreck and\r\nrotten to the core, miserably emaciated and panting for breath. I will\r\nnot give him half a year’s life. Then I will go to Liu Pei and he will\r\nbe unable to deny the request.”\r\n\r\nBut Chou Yü was still unmollified. Suddenly came a messenger from Sun\r\nChʻüan, who said, “Our lord is laying siege to Hofei but in several\r\nbattles has had no victory. He now orders you to withdraw from here and\r\ngo to Hofei to help him.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Chou Yü marched back to Chʻaisang. Having reached home he\r\nbegan to give attention to the recovery of his health. He sent Chʻêng\r\nPʻu with the marine and land forces to Hofei ready for Sun Chʻüan’s\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei was exceedingly well satisfied with the possession of his new\r\nterritory and his thoughts turned to more ambitious schemes. Then a\r\ncertain man came to him to suggest a plan. This man was I Chi and,\r\nremembering the kindly feeling of other days, Yüan-tê received him most\r\ngraciously. When he was seated, and his host had asked what he\r\nproposed, he said, “You wish for a plan to accomplish yet greater\r\ndeeds; why not seek wise men and ask them?”\r\n\r\n“Where are these wise men to be found?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nI Chi replied, “In this district there is a certain family named Ma,\r\nfive brothers, all of whom are known as men of ability. The youngest is\r\ncalled Ma Su, or Ma Yu-chʻang. The ablest is Ma Liang, or Chi-chʻang,\r\nwho has white hairs in his eyebrows, and the villagers have a little\r\nrhyming couplet that means there are five sons in the family Ma but\r\nwhite eyebrows is the best of them. You should get this man to draw up\r\na plan for you.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê told them to request his presence. Ma Liang came and was\r\nreceived with great respect. He was asked to suggest a plan for the\r\nsecurity of the newly acquired district and he said, “Attacked as it is\r\non all sides this district is not one in which one is permanently\r\nsecure. You should let Liu Chʻi remain here till he is recovered from\r\nhis present illness, the actual protection of the place being left in\r\nthe hands of trusty friends. Obtain an Edict appointing him Governor\r\nand the people will be content. Then conquer Wuling, Changsha, Kueiyang\r\nand Linling and with the resources you will thus acquire you will have\r\nthe means for further plans. That should be your policy.”\r\n\r\n“Which of the four districts should be first taken?” asked Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“The nearest, Linling, which lies in the west of Hsiang (Hunan). The\r\nnext is Wuling and after these the other two.”\r\n\r\nMa Liang was given an appointment as secretary, with I Chi as his\r\nsecond. Then Yüan-tê consulted Kʻung-ming about sending Liu Chʻi to\r\nHsiangyang, so that Yün-chʻang could be free to return. Next they made\r\npreparations to attack Linling, and Chang Fei was to lead the van. Chao\r\nYün was to guard the rear while Yüan-tê and Kʻung-ming were to command\r\nthe main body. A legion and a half were left to hold Chingchou. Mi Chu\r\nand Liu Fêng were left to guard Chiangling.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of Linling was Liu Tu. When danger thus threatened he\r\ncalled in his son Liu Hsien and they discussed the case. The son was\r\nvery self-confident and said to his father, “Have no anxiety. They may\r\nhave the known and famous warriors, Chang Fei and Chao Yün, but we have\r\nour leader, Hsing Tao-yung, who is match for any number of men. He can\r\nwithstand them.”\r\n\r\nSo Liu Hsien, with the famous leader, was entrusted with the defence.\r\nAt the head of a full legion they made a camp about thirty li from the\r\ncity, with the shelter of hills and a river. Their scouts brought news\r\nthat Kʻung-ming was close at hand with one army. Hsing Tao-jung decided\r\nto check his advance and went forth to oppose him. When both sides were\r\narrayed, Hsing rode to the front. In his hand he held a battle-axe\r\ncalled Cleaver of Mountains. In a mighty voice he cried, “Rebels, how\r\ncomes it that you have dared to enter our territory?”\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of the opposing army, where appeared a cluster of\r\nyellow flags, there came out a small four-wheeled carriage in which\r\nsat, very erect, a certain man dressed in white, with a turban on his\r\nhead. In one hand he held a feather fan, with which he signed to the\r\nwarrior to approach. At the same time he said, “I am Chuko Kʻung-ming,\r\nof Nanyang, whose plans broke up the countless legions of Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nso that nothing of them returned whence they started. How then can you\r\nhope to oppose me? I now offer you peace and it will be well for you to\r\nsurrender.”\r\n\r\nHsing laughed derisively. “Their defeat was owing to the plan of Chou\r\nYü; you had nothing to do with it. How dare you try to deceive me?”\r\n\r\nSo saying he swung up his battle-axe and came running toward\r\nKʻung-ming. But he turned his carriage and retired within the lines\r\nwhich closed up behind him. Hsing still came rushing on. As he reached\r\nthe array the men fell away on both sides and let him enter. Well\r\nwithin he looked round for his chief opponent. Seeing a yellow flag\r\nmoving along quietly he concluded that Kʻung-ming was with it and so\r\nfollowed it. When the flag had gone over the shoulder of a hill it\r\nstopped. Then suddenly as if the earth had opened and swallowed it up,\r\nthe four-wheeled carriage disappeared, while in its place came a\r\nferocious warrior, with a long spear in his hand and mounted on a\r\ncurvetting steed. It was Chang Fei, who dashed at Hsing with a\r\ntremendous roar.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted Hsing Tao-jung whirled up his battle-axe and went to\r\nmeet Chang Fei. But after four or five bouts he saw that there was no\r\nchance of victory for him, so he turned his horse and ran. Chang Fei\r\npursued, the air shaking with the thunder of his voice.\r\n\r\nThen the ambushed men appeared. Tao-jung, nothing daunted, rushed into\r\ntheir midst. But in front appeared another warrior barring the way, who\r\ncalled out, “Do you know me? I am Chao Tzŭ-lung of Chʻangshan.”\r\n\r\nHsing Tao-jung knew that all was over; he could neither fight nor fly.\r\nSo he dismounted and gave in. He was fettered and taken to camp, where\r\nwere Yüan-tê and Kʻung-ming. The former ordered him out to execution,\r\nbut Kʻung-ming hastily checked him.\r\n\r\n“We will accept your submission if you capture Liu Hsien for us,” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nThe captive accepted the offer without the least hesitation, and when\r\nKʻung-ming asked how he intended to do it, he replied, “If you will set\r\nme free, I shall be cunning of speech. If you raid the camp this\r\nevening you will find me your helper on the inside. I will make Liu\r\nHsien a prisoner and will hand him over to you. He being captured, his\r\nfather will surrender at once.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê doubted the good faith of the man, but Kʻung-ming said he knew\r\nhe could answer for him. Wherefore he was set free and went back to\r\ncamp, where he related all that had occurred.\r\n\r\n“What can we do?” asked Liu Hsien.\r\n\r\n“We can meet trick with trick. Put soldiers in ambush to-night outside\r\nour camp while within everything will appear as usual. When Kʻung-ming\r\ncomes we shall capture him.”\r\n\r\nThe ambush was prepared. At the second watch a troop came out of the\r\ndarkness and appeared in the gate. Each man carried a torch and they\r\nbegan to set fire to all about them. Out dashed Liu Hsien and Hsing\r\nTao-jung and the incendiaries forthwith fled. The two warriors pursued\r\nthem, but the fugitives ran and then suddenly disappeared at about ten\r\nli from the camp. Much surprised the two turned to wend their way back\r\nto their own camp.\r\n\r\nIt was still burning for no one had extinguished the flames. Soon from\r\nbehind them came out Chang Fei. Liu Hsien called out to his companion\r\nnot to enter the burning camp, but to go with him to attack\r\nKʻung-ming’s stockade.\r\n\r\nThereupon they turned again, but at a distance of ten li Chao Yün and a\r\ntroop suddenly debouched upon their road. Chao Yün attacked and Hsing\r\nTao-jung fell. Liu Hsien turned to flee, but Chang Fei was close upon\r\nhim and made him prisoner. He was thrown across a horse, bound and\r\ntaken to camp. When he saw Kʻung-ming he laid blame on his fallen\r\ncomrade saying he had listened to his evil counsel and this deed was\r\nnot his own wish. Kʻung-ming ordered them to loose his bonds, had him\r\nproperly dressed and gave him wine to cheer him and help him forget his\r\ntroubles. When he was recovered he was told to go to his father and\r\npersuade him to yield.\r\n\r\n“And if he does not, the city shall be destroyed and every one put to\r\ndeath,” said Kʻung-ming as he left.\r\n\r\nThe son returned to the city and told his father these things. Liu Tu\r\nat once decided to yield and forthwith hoisted the flag of surrender,\r\nopened the gates, and went out taking his seal of office with him. He\r\nwas re-appointed to his prefectship, but his son was sent to Chingchou\r\nfor service with the army.\r\n\r\nThe people of Linling all rejoiced greatly at the change of rulers.\r\nYüan-tê entered the city, calmed and re-assured the people and rewarded\r\nhis army.\r\n\r\nBut he at once began to think of the next move and asked for an officer\r\nto volunteer to take Kueiyang. Chao Yün offered, but Chang Fei\r\nvehemently proposed himself for the command of the expedition. So they\r\nwrangled and contended.\r\n\r\nThen said Kʻung-ming, “Undoubtedly Chao Yün was first to volunteer,\r\nwherefore he is to go.”\r\n\r\nStill Chang Fei opposed and insisted on going. They were told to decide\r\nthe dispute by drawing lots and Chao Yün drew the winning lot. Chang\r\nFei was still very angry and grumbled, “I would not have wanted any\r\nhelpers: just three companies and I would have done it.”\r\n\r\n“I also only want three companies,” said Chao Yün. “And if I fail I am\r\nwilling to suffer the penalties.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming was pleased that he recognised his responsibility so fully,\r\nand with the commission gave him three companies of veterans.\r\n\r\nThough the matter was thus settled Chang Fei was discontented and\r\npressed his claim till Yüan-tê bade him desist and retire.\r\n\r\nWith his three companies Chao Yün took the road to Kueiyang. The\r\nPrefect Chao Fan soon heard of his approach and hastily called his\r\nofficers to take counsel. Two of them, Chʻên Ying and Pao Lung, offered\r\nto meet the invaders and turn them back.\r\n\r\nThese two warriors belonged to Kueiyang and had made themselves famous\r\nas hunters. Chʻên used a “Flying Fork” and Pao could draw a bow with\r\nsuch force that he had been known to send an arrow through two tigers.\r\nSo strong were they, as well as bold.\r\n\r\nThey stood before Chao Fan and said, “We will lead the way against Liu\r\nPei.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect replied, “I know that Liu Pei is of the Imperial family:\r\nKʻung-ming is exceedingly resourceful: Kuan Yü and Chang Fei are very\r\nbold. But the commander of this force is Chao Tzŭ-lung who, on one\r\noccasion, faced a hundred legions and never blenched. Our small force\r\nhere cannot stand against such people. We shall have to yield.”\r\n\r\n“Let me go out to fight,” said Chʻên Ying. “If I cannot capture Chao\r\nYün then you can yield.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect could not resist him and gave his consent. Then Chʻên Ying,\r\nwith three companies, went forth and soon the two armies came within\r\nsight of each other. When Chʻên Ying’s army was drawn up he girded on\r\nhis “Flying Fork” and rode to the front. Chao Yün gripped his spear and\r\nrode to meet him. Chao Yün began to rail at Chʻên Ying, saying, “My\r\nmaster is the brother of Liu Piao to whom belonged this land. Now he is\r\nsupporting his nephew the heir and son of Liu Piao. Having taken\r\nChingchou I am come to soothe and comfort the people here. Why then do\r\nyou oppose me?”\r\n\r\n“We are supporters of the Minister Tsʻao and are no followers of your\r\nmaster,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nChao Yün, waxing angry, firmly grasped his spear and rode forward. His\r\nopponent twirled “Flying Fork” and advanced. The horses met, but after\r\nfour or five encounters Chʻên Ying, realising that there was no hope of\r\nvictory, turned and fled. Chao Yün followed. Suddenly turning, Chʻên\r\nYing got close to Chao Yün and flung the fork. Chao Yün deftly caught\r\nit and threw it back. Chʻên Ying dodged away, but Chao Yün soon caught\r\nhim up, seized Chʻên Ying, dragged him out of the saddle and threw him\r\nto the ground. Then he called up his soldiers and they bound the\r\nprisoner. He was taken to the camp, while his men scattered and fled.\r\n\r\n“I thought you would not dare a combat with me,” said Chao Yün to the\r\nprisoner when they had returned to camp. “However, I am not going to\r\nput you to death. You are free. But persuade your master to yield.”\r\n\r\nChʻên Ying asked pardon, put his hands over his head and fled like a\r\nfrightened rat. When he reached his city he told the Prefect all these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“My original desire was to yield, but you insisted on fighting and this\r\nis what it has brought you to.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke the Prefect. He bade Chʻên begone and then prepared his letter\r\nof submission and put up his seal. With a small party he went out of\r\nthe city and wended his way to Chao Yün’s camp. Chao received him\r\ngraciously, offered him wine and then accepted the seal of office.\r\nAfter the wine had gone round several times Chao Fan became talkative,\r\n“General, your surname is the same as mine, and five centuries ago we\r\nwere one family. You are from Chênting and so am I. Moreover we are\r\nfrom the same village. If you do not mind we might swear brotherhood. I\r\nshould be very happy.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün was pleased and they compared ages. They were of the same\r\nyear. However, Chao Yün was the elder by four months and so Chao Fan\r\nmade his bow as younger brother. The two men, having so many things in\r\ncommon, were very pleased with each other and seemed fitted to be close\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAt eventide the feast broke up and the late Prefect returned to his\r\ndwelling. Next day he requested Chao Yün to enter the city, where,\r\nafter he had assured the people of their safety, Chao Yün went to a\r\nbanquet at the ya-mên. When they had become mellow with wine the\r\nPrefect invited Chao Yün into the inner quarters, where wine was again\r\nserved. When Chao Yün was a little intoxicated, his host bade a woman\r\ncome forth and offer a cup of wine to the guest.\r\n\r\nThe woman was dressed entirely in white silk and her beauty was such as\r\nto overthrow cities and ruin states.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” asked Chao Yün.\r\n\r\n“My sister-in-law; her maiden name was Fan.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün at once changed his look and treated her with deference. When\r\nshe had offered the cup the host told her to be seated and join the\r\nparty but Chao Yün declined this addition to the evening and the lady\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n“Why did you trouble your sister-in-law to present wine to me,\r\nbrother?” asked Chao Yün.\r\n\r\n“There is a reason,” said the host smiling. “I pray you let me tell\r\nyou. My brother died three years ago and left her a widow. But this\r\ncannot be regarded as the end of the story. I have often advised her to\r\nmarry again, but she said she would only do so if three conditions were\r\nsatisfied in one man’s person. The suitor must be famous for literary\r\ngrace and warlike exploits, secondly, handsome and highly esteemed and,\r\nthirdly, of the same name as our own. Now where in all the world was\r\nsuch a combination likely to be found? Yet here are you, brother,\r\ndignified, handsome and prepossessing, a man whose name is known all\r\nover the wide world and of the desired name. You exactly fulfil my\r\nsister’s ambitions. If you do not find her too ugly, I should like her\r\nto marry you and I will provide a dowry. What think you of such an\r\nalliance, such a bond of relationship?”\r\n\r\nBut Chao Yün rose in anger, shouting, “As I have just sworn brotherhood\r\nwith you, is not your sister-in-law my sister-in-law? How could you\r\nthink of bringing such confusion into the relationship.”\r\n\r\nShame suffused Chao Fan’s face and he said, “I only thought of being\r\nkind to you; why are you so very rude to me?”\r\n\r\nHe looked right and left to his attendants with murder in his eye. Chao\r\nYün raised his fist and knocked him down. Then he strode out of the\r\nplace, mounted and rode out of the city.\r\n\r\nChao Fan at once called in his two fighting men. Chʻên Ying said, “He\r\nhas gone away in a rage, which means that we shall have to fight him.”\r\n\r\n“I greatly fear you will lose,” said Chao Fan.\r\n\r\n“We will pretend to be deserters,” said Pao Lung, “and so get among his\r\nmen. When you challenge him we will suddenly catch him.”\r\n\r\n“We shall have to take some others with us,” said Chʻên.\r\n\r\n“Half a company will be ample,” said Pao.\r\n\r\nSo in the night the two men and their followers ran over to Chao Yün’s\r\ncamp to desert.\r\n\r\nChao Yün understood the trick they would play, but he called them in\r\nand they said, “When Chao Fan tempted you with that fair lady he wanted\r\nto make you drunk and get you into the private apartments so that he\r\nmight murder you and send your head to Tsʻao Tsʻao. Yes; he was as\r\nwicked as that even. We saw you go away in anger and we thought that\r\nwould mean grave trouble for us and so we have deserted.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün listened with simulated joy, and he had wine served to the two\r\nmen, and pressed them to drink so that they were quite overcome. When\r\nthis was done he had both bound with cords, called up their followers\r\nand asked them whether this was real or pretended desertion and they\r\ntold him the truth. Then he gave the soldiers wine and said, “Those who\r\nwanted to harm me are your leaders and not you. If you do as I tell you\r\nyou shall be well rewarded.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers threw themselves to the ground and promised obedience.\r\nThereupon the two leaders were beheaded. The half company were made to\r\nlead the way and act as screen for a whole company of horsemen and the\r\nparty set out at full speed for Kueiyang. When they got there they\r\nsummoned the gate and said that they had slain Chao Yün and had got\r\nback. And they wished to speak with the Prefect.\r\n\r\nThose on the wall lighted flares and inspected those at the gate.\r\nSurely enough they wore the uniforms of their own people and Chao Fan\r\nwent out to them. He was immediately seized and made prisoner. Then\r\nChao Yün entered the city, restored order and sent off swift messengers\r\nto Yüan-tê who at once, with his adviser, came to Kueiyang.\r\n\r\nWhen they had taken their seats the late Prefect was brought in and\r\nplaced at the foot of the steps. In response to Kʻung-ming’s questions\r\nhe related the history of the proposed marriage.\r\n\r\nSaid Kʻung-ming to Chao Yün, “But this seems a fine project; why did\r\nyou receive the proposal so roughly?”\r\n\r\n“Chao Fan and I had just sworn brotherhood and so marriage with his\r\nsister-in-law would have called down on my head universal blame. That\r\nis one reason. Another is that I should have made his sister fail to\r\nkeep her dutiful chastity. And thirdly I did not know whether I might\r\ntrust such a proposal from one who had just yielded to force. My lord,\r\nyour position as a recent victor was one of danger and could I risk the\r\nfailure of your plans for the sake of a woman?”\r\n\r\n“But now that the plan has been carried out and we are victors would\r\nyou care to marry her?”\r\n\r\n“There are plenty of women in the world. All my fear is for my\r\nreputation. What is a family to me?”\r\n\r\n“You are indeed right honourable,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nChao Fan was released and restored to the prefectorate. Chao Yün was\r\nconspicuously rewarded.\r\n\r\nBut Chang Fei was angry and disappointed. “So Tzŭ-lung gets all the\r\npraise and I am worth nothing,” cried he. “Just give me three companies\r\nand I will take Wuling and bring you the Prefect.”\r\n\r\nThis pleased Kʻung-ming, who said, “There is no reason why you should\r\nnot go, but I will only require one condition of you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wondrous, the plans of the general, so doth he conquer in battle;\r\n    Soldiers keenly competing gain renown in the fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition that Kʻung-ming made will appear in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nKUAN YU, FROM A SENSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, RELEASES HUANG CHUNG:\r\nSUN CHʻÜAN FIGHTS A GREAT BATTLE WITH CHANG LIAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Kʻung-ming required from Chang Fei was a formal recognition of\r\nresponsibility for success. Said he, “When Chao Yün went on his\r\nexpedition he gave written guarantee of being responsible for success\r\nand you ought to do the same now that you are starting for Wuling. In\r\nthat case you may have men and start.”\r\n\r\nSo Chang Fei gave the required document and received joyfully the three\r\ncompanies of soldiers he had demanded. He set out at once and travelled\r\nwithout rest till he reached Wuling.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prefect of Wuling, Chin Hsüan by name, heard that an\r\nexpedition against him was afoot he mustered his officers and recruited\r\nbrave soldiers and put his weapons in order ready for the struggle. And\r\nhis army moved out of the city.\r\n\r\nA certain secretary, Kung Chih, remonstrated with his chief for\r\nopposing a scion of the imperial house, saying, “Liu Yüan-tê is of the\r\nHans, and recognised as an uncle of the Emperor. All the world knows he\r\nis kindly and righteous. Added to that his brother Chang Fei is\r\nextraordinarily bold. We cannot face them in battle with hope of\r\nsuccess. Our best course is to give in.”\r\n\r\nBut his master angrily replied, “Do you want to play the traitor and\r\ntake the side of the rebels and help them?”\r\n\r\nHe called in the lictors and told them to put Kung to death. The other\r\nofficers interceded for him, saying, “It augers ill to start an\r\nexpedition by slaying your own men.”\r\n\r\nSo the Prefect merely sent Kung Chih away. He himself led the army out\r\nof the city. After marching twenty li he met with Chang Fei’s army.\r\n\r\nChang Fei at once rode to the front, spear ready to thrust, and opened\r\nwith a shout. Chin Hsüan turned to his officers and asked who would go\r\nout to fight him, but no one replied; they were too afraid.\r\n\r\nSo the Prefect himself galloped out, flourishing his sword. Seeing him\r\nadvance Chang Fei shouted in a voice of thunder. Poor Chin was seized\r\nwith panic, turned pale and could not go on. He turned his steed and\r\nfled. Then Chang Fei and his army went in pursuit and smote the\r\nfugitives, chasing them to the city wall.\r\n\r\nHere the fugitives were greeted by a flight of arrows from their own\r\nwall. Greatly frightened, Chin Hsüan looked up to see what this meant\r\nand there was Kung Chih, who had opposed him, standing on the wall.\r\n\r\n“You brought defeat upon yourself because you opposed the will of God,”\r\ncried the traitor. “I and the people with me are determined to yield to\r\nLiu Pei.”\r\n\r\nJust as he finished speaking an arrow wounded Chin Hsüan in the face\r\nand he fell to the ground. Thereupon his own men cut off his head,\r\nwhich they forthwith presented to Chang Fei. Kung Chih then went out\r\nand made formal submission and Chang Fei bade him take his letter and\r\nthe seal to Kueiyang to Liu Pei, who was pleased to hear of Chang Fei’s\r\nsuccess and gave the prefectship to Kung Chih. Soon after Yüan-tê came\r\nin person and soothed the people.\r\n\r\nThis done he wrote to his other brother telling him I-tê and Tzŭ-lung\r\nhad gained a district each. Kuan at once wrote back and said that\r\nChangsha was yet to be taken and if he was not thought too feeble he\r\nwould like to be sent to attack it. Yüan-tê agreed and sent Chang Fei\r\nto relieve his brother, whom he ordered to return and prepare for an\r\nexpedition to Changsha. Kuan Yü came and went in to see his elder\r\nbrother and Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nAt this interview Kʻung-ming said that the other two successful\r\nwarriors had done their work with three companies. The Prefect of\r\nChangsha, Han Yüan, was not worth mentioning, but there was a certain\r\ngeneral with him, named Huang Chung, who had to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\n“Huang Chung,” said Kʻung-ming, “is a native of Nanyang. He used to be\r\nin the service of Liu Piao and was a colleague of Liu Pʻan, when he was\r\nin command of Changsha. After Liu Piao’s death he joined Han Yüan when\r\nhe took command of the district. Now, although he is nearly sixty he is\r\na man to be feared and a warrior of a thousand. You ought to take a\r\nlarger number of men.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü replied, “General, what makes you damp another man’s ardour to\r\nfight and do away with your own dignity? I do not think the old leader\r\nneed be discussed and I do not think I require three companies of men.\r\nGive me my own half company of swordsmen and I will have the heads of\r\nboth our enemies to sacrifice to our standard.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê resisted this decision of Kuan Yü, but Kuan would not give way.\r\nHe just took his half company and set out.\r\n\r\n“If he is not careful how he attacks Huang Chung there will be a\r\nmishap,” said Kʻung-ming. “You must go to support him.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê accordingly, at the head of another and larger party, set out\r\ntoward Changsha.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of Changsha was of hasty temperament with small compunction\r\nin matters of life and death and was universally hated. When he heard\r\nof the army coming against him he called his veteran leader, Huang, to\r\nask advice. The latter said, “Do not be distressed; this sword of mine\r\nand my bow are equal to the slaughter of all who may come.”\r\n\r\nHuang Chung had been very strong and could bend the two hundred catty\r\nbow and was a most perfect archer. When he referred to his one-time\r\nprowess a certain man spoke up and said, “Let not the old General go\r\nout to battle. Trust to my right arm and you shall have this Kuan a\r\nprisoner in your hands.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was named Yang Ling. The Prefect accepted his offer and\r\ntold off a company to go with him and they quickly rode out of the\r\ncity. About fifty li from the city they observed a great cloud of dust\r\napproaching and soon distinguished the invaders. Yang Ling set his\r\nspear and rode to the front to abuse and fight. Kuan Yü made no reply\r\nto the abuse, but rode forward flourishing his sword. The warriors soon\r\nmet and in the third encounter Yang Ling was cut down. Kuan Yü’s\r\ncompany dashed forward and pursued the defeated force to the city wall.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prefect heard of this reverse he ordered the veteran Huang\r\nChung to go out while he went up on the city wall to watch the fight.\r\n\r\nHuang Chung took his sword and crossed the drawbridge at the head of\r\nhis men. Kuan Yü, seeing an old leader riding out, knew it must be\r\nHuang Chung. He halted his men and placed them in line with their\r\nswords at the point. Then sitting there on horseback he said, “He who\r\ncomes is surely Huang Chung, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Since you know me, how dare you come within my boundaries?” replied\r\nthe veteran.\r\n\r\n“I have come expressly to get your head.”\r\n\r\nThen the combat began. They fought a hundred and more bouts and neither\r\nseemed nearer victory. At this point the Prefect, fearing some mishap\r\nto his veteran general, beat the gong to retreat and the battle ceased,\r\none side going into the city and the other camping ten li away to the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü thought in his heart that the fame of the veteran opposed to\r\nhim was well merited. He had fought a hundred bouts and discovered\r\nnever a weak spot. He determined that in the next encounter he would\r\nuse a feint (or “Parthian” stab) and so overcome him.\r\n\r\nNext day, the early meal eaten, Kuan Yü came to the city wall and\r\noffered his challenge. The Prefect seated himself on the city wall and\r\nbade his veteran warrior go out to accept it and, at the head of a few\r\nhorsemen, he dashed across the drawbridge. The two champions engaged\r\nand at the end of half a hundred bouts neither had the advantage. On\r\nboth sides the soldiers cheered lustily.\r\n\r\nWhen the drums were beating most furiously, suddenly Kuan Yü wheeled\r\nround his horse and fled. Of course Huang Chung followed. Just as the\r\nmoment for the feint arrived Kuan Yü heard behind him a tremendous\r\ncrash and turned to see his pursuer lying prone upon the ground. His\r\nsteed had stumbled and thrown him. Kuan Yü turned, raised his sword in\r\nboth hands, and cried in a fierce tone, “I spare your life, but quick!\r\nget another horse and come again to battle.”\r\n\r\nHuang Chung pulled his horse to its feet hastily, leapt upon its back\r\nand went into the city at full speed. The prefect was astonished and\r\nasked for an account of the accident. “The horse is too old,” replied\r\nHuang.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not shoot since your arm is so perfect?” asked the\r\nPrefect.\r\n\r\n“I will try again to-morrow,” said Huang. “Then I will run away as if\r\novercome and so tempt him to the drawbridge and then shoot him.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect gave the veteran a grey horse that he usually rode himself;\r\nHuang thanked him and retired.\r\n\r\nBut he could not forget Kuan Yü’s generous conduct, nor could he\r\nunderstand it. He could not make up his mind to shoot the man who had\r\nspared his life. Yet if he did not shoot, he betrayed his duty as a\r\nsoldier. It was very perplexing and the whole night spent in thinking\r\nit over found him still undecided.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak a man came in saying that Kuan Yü was near the wall and\r\nchallenging them again. So Huang Chung gave orders to go out.\r\n\r\nNow Kuan Yü, having fought for two days and not having overcome Huang\r\nChung, was very ill at ease. So he called up all his dignity when he\r\nwent forth to fight that day. When they had got to the thirtieth bout\r\nHuang Chung fled as if he was overcome. Kuan Yü pursued.\r\n\r\nAs he rode away Huang Chung thought in his heart, “He spared me only\r\nyesterday and I cannot bear to shoot him to-day.” Putting up his sword\r\nhe took his bow and twanged the string only; no arrow flew. Kuan Yü\r\ndodged, but seeing no arrow in the air, he re-took the pursuit. Again\r\nHuang twanged an arrowless bowstring and again Kuan dodged, but no\r\narrow came. Then he said to himself, “He cannot shoot,” and pressed on\r\nin pursuit.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the city wall, the veteran stopped on the drawbridge,\r\nfitted an arrow, pulled the bow and sent an arrow flying that just hit\r\nthe base of the plume on Kuan’s helmet. The soldiers shouted at the\r\ndisplay of marksmanship. Kuan Yü was taken aback and set off for camp\r\nwith the arrow still sticking. Then he heard that Huang Chung’s skill\r\nwas said to be equal to piercing a willow leaf at a hundred paces and\r\nhe understood that he owed this warning in the shape of an arrow in his\r\nplume to gratitude for sparing the veteran the preceding day.\r\n\r\nBoth withdrew. But when the veteran leader went up on the wall to see\r\nthe Prefect, he was at once seized. “What have I done?” cried Huang\r\nChung.\r\n\r\n“I have seen these last three days that you were fooling me; you were\r\nslack the day before yesterday, which proved you had some sinister\r\nintention. Yesterday, when your horse stumbled and he spared you, it\r\nshowed that you were in league with him. And to-day you twice twanged a\r\nvain bowstring, while at the third shot you only hit your opponent’s\r\nhelmet. Dare you say there is no secret understanding in all this? If I\r\ndo not put you to death it will assuredly redound to my own hurt.”\r\n\r\nThe Prefect ordered him to be executed outside the city gate. The\r\nintercession of the officers he met by saying that any one who pleaded\r\nfor the condemned would be regarded as in the plot.\r\n\r\nThe executioners had hustled the old man out of the city and the sword\r\nwas in the air and on the point of descending, when a man suddenly\r\ndashed in, cut down the lictor and rescued Huang Chung.\r\n\r\n“Huang Chung is our bulwark;” shouted he, “to destroy him is to destroy\r\nthe Changsha people. This Han is too fierce and cruel, too lightly\r\nvalues good men and is too arrogant toward his officers. We ought\r\nrather to kill him, and those who will, let them follow me.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned toward this bold speaker, who was bronzed and had eyes\r\nlike the Cowherd’s star. Some of them knew him as Wei Yen, a native of\r\nIyang. He had followed Liu Pei from Hsiangyang but, unable to come up\r\nwith him, had gone into the service of Han Yüan. Han Yüan took\r\nexception to his arrogant carriage and lack of polish and neglected\r\nhim. And so he had come to this place.\r\n\r\nAfter the rescue of Huang Chung he called upon the people to make an\r\nend of the Prefect. He waved his arm and shouted to the people. Soon he\r\nhad a following of several hundreds. Huang Chung could not stop them.\r\nIn a very short time Wei had dashed up on the wall and the Prefect lay\r\ndead. Taking his head, Wei Yen rode off out of the city to lay the\r\nblood-stained trophy at the feet of Kuan Yü, who forthwith went into\r\nthe city to restore confidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the people were all quiet, Kuan sent to request Huang Chung to\r\ncome to see him, but the old general pleaded illness. Next he sent the\r\ngood news to his brother and to Kʻung-ming and asked them to come.\r\n\r\nSoon after Kuan Yü had left to capture Changsha, Liu Pei and Kʻung-ming\r\nhad followed him up with supports in case of need. While on the march a\r\nblack flag was furled backwards and a crow flew over from north to\r\nsouth croaking thrice as it passed.\r\n\r\n“What good or evil things do these omens presage?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nWith hands hidden within his long sleeves, Kʻung-ming performed a rapid\r\ncalculation on his fingers of the auspices and replied, “Changsha is\r\ntaken and a great leader mastered. We shall know soon after noon.”\r\n\r\nSure enough a simple soldier presently came galloping along with the\r\nwelcome tidings of the capture of the city and saying that the two city\r\nwarriors who had aided them were near waiting the arrival of Liu Pei.\r\nSoon after they arrived Liu Pei entered the city, where he was escorted\r\nto the magistracy and heard the recital of Huang Chung’s deeds.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê went in person to Huang’s house and enquired for him, whereupon\r\nhe came forth and yielded formally. He requested to be permitted to\r\nbury the remains of the late Prefect on the east of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lofty as is heaven above earth was the spirit of the captain,\r\n    Who, even in his old age, suffered sorrows in the south;\r\n    Cheerfully had he approached death, with no thought of resentment,\r\n    But, bowing before the conquerer, he hung his head and was ashamed.\r\n    Praise the sword, gleaming snow-white, and the glory of super-human\r\n                                                               bravery,\r\n    Consider the mail-clad steed snuffing the wind and rejoicing in\r\n                                                            the battle,\r\n    That warrior’s name shall stand high and its brightness be\r\n                                                          undiminished,\r\n    While the cold moon sheds her light on the waters of Hsiang and\r\n                                                                  Tʻan.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was generous toward the veteran leader who had come under his\r\nbanner. But when Wei Yen was introduced, Kʻung-ming suddenly ordered\r\nhim to be thrust forth and put to death.\r\n\r\n“He has merit; he has committed no fault,” exclaimed Yüan-tê. “Why slay\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nBut Kʻung-ming replied, “Ingratitude; to eat a man’s bread and slay him\r\nis most disloyal; to live on his land and offer his territory to\r\nanother is most wrong. I see the bone of treachery at the back of his\r\nhead and he will certainly turn against his master. Wherefore it is\r\nwell to put him to death and prevent him from doing harm.”\r\n\r\n“If we slay this man others who may wish to surrender will be deterred\r\nby the danger. I pray you forgive him.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming pointed his finger at Wei Yen and said, “You are pardoned.\r\nYou would do well to be perfectly faithful to your lord as well as\r\ngrateful. Do not let a single thought stray elsewhere or I will have\r\nyour head by fair means or foul.”\r\n\r\nWei Yen went away muttering to himself.\r\n\r\nHaving given in with good grace, Huang Chung introduced a nephew of Liu\r\nPiao, named Pʻan, then living in Yuhsien near by. Yüan-tê employed him\r\nin the administration of Changsha.\r\n\r\nAll being tranquil at Changsha, Yüan-tê and his army returned to\r\nChingchou. The name Yuchiangkʻou was changed to Kungan and soon all was\r\nprosperous. Taxes were freely paid and able men from all sides came to\r\nassist in the administration. Guards were placed at strategic points.\r\n\r\nIt is time to return to Chou Yü. When he went to Chʻaisang to recover\r\nfrom his wound he left Kan Ning in command at Lingchün and Ling Tʻung\r\nat Hanyang. The fleet was shared between these two places to be ready\r\nto move when required. The remainder of the force was under Chʻêng Pʻu\r\nand he went to Hofei, where Sun Chʻüan had been since the fight at Red\r\nWall. He was still fighting the northern army and in half a score\r\nencounters, small and great, neither had gained a decided advantage. He\r\ncould not approach the city but entrenched himself about fifty li away.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard of the coming of reinforcements he was very pleased and\r\nwent in person to meet and welcome the leaders. Lu Su was in advance of\r\nthe main body and Sun Chʻüan dismounted and stood by the roadside to\r\ngreet him. As soon as he saw this, Lu Su slid out of the saddle and\r\nmade his obeisance.\r\n\r\nBut the officers were amazed at the attitude of Sun Chʻüan, and still\r\nmore so when Sun Chʻüan asked Lu Su to remount and ride by his side.\r\nPresently he said secretly to Lu Su, “I, the Lone One, dismounted to\r\ngreet you as you saw; was that manifestation enough for you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“Then what further can I do?”\r\n\r\n“I want to see your authority and virtue spread over the four seas and\r\nenfold the nine provinces and you yourself playing your part as\r\nEmperor. Then will my name be inscribed in the annals and I shall\r\nindeed be known.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan clapped his hands and laughed gleefully.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the camp a banquet was prepared and the services of\r\nthe new arrivals were praised and glorified.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Hofei was one day under discussion when one came in\r\nto say that Chang Liao had sent a written challenge to battle. Sun\r\nChʻüan tore open the cover and what he read therein made him very\r\nwrath. “This Chang has insulted me grossly,” said he, “he hears that\r\nChʻêng Pʻu has arrived and sends a challenge. To-morrow, O newly-come\r\nwarriors, you shall see me fight with him. You shall have no share in\r\nthe battle.”\r\n\r\nOrders were given that next morning the army would move out of camp and\r\nadvance on Hofei. Early in the morning, when they had advanced about\r\nhalfway, they met the army of Tsʻao and prepared for battle. Sun\r\nChʻüan, with helmet and breastplate of silver, rode to the front with\r\nSung Chʻien and Chia Hua, each armed with a chʻi halberd to support him\r\nand guard him one on each side.\r\n\r\nWhen the third roll of the drum ceased, the centre of the Tsʻao array\r\nopened to allow the exit of three warriors, all fully armed. They were\r\nChang Liao, supported by Li Tien and Yo Chin. Chang Liao, the central\r\nfigure, especially designated Sun Chʻüan as the object of his\r\nchallenge. Sun Chʻüan took his spear and was about to accept the\r\nchallenge, when the ranks behind him were broken by Tʻaishih Tzŭ, who\r\ngalloped forth with his spear ready to thrust. Chang Liao whirled up\r\nhis sword to strike the newcomer and the two fought near a hundred\r\nbouts without a decisive blow.\r\n\r\nThen said Li Tien to Yo Chin, “He there opposite us with the silver\r\nhelm is Sun Chʻüan; could I but capture him the loss of our four score\r\nlegions would be amply avenged.”\r\n\r\nSo speaking he rode out, alone, just one man and one sword, and went\r\nsidelong toward the two combatants. Then suddenly, swift as a flash of\r\nlightning, he ran forward and slashed at Sun. But Sun Chʻüan’s two\r\nguards were too quick for him. Up went the two chʻi guarding their\r\nlord’s head. The blow fell, but on the crossed chʻi which were shorn\r\nthrough near the head, and in another moment they were hammering away\r\non the head of Yo Chin’s steed with the shafts of their broken weapons\r\nand forcing him back.\r\n\r\nSung Chʻien snatched a spear from a soldier near and went in pursuit of\r\nYo Chin, but Li Tien, on the other side, fitted an arrow to his bow and\r\naimed at Sung’s heart from behind. And he fell as the bowstring\r\ntwanged.\r\n\r\nThen Tʻaishih Tzŭ, seeing a squadron of horse in motion toward him,\r\nleft off the fight with Chang Liao and returned to his own line. At\r\nthis Chang Liao fell on in a swift attack and the army of Wu, thrown\r\ninto confusion, scattered and fled.\r\n\r\nChang Liao, having distinguished Sun Chʻüan in the distance, galloped\r\nin pursuit and had nearly come up with him, when Chʻêng Pʻu happily\r\nrushed in from one side of the line of fight, stayed the pursuit and\r\nsaved his master. Chang Liao withdrew to Hofei. Sun Chʻüan was escorted\r\nback to his main camp, where his beaten soldiers gradually rejoined him\r\nand their ranks were reformed.\r\n\r\nWhen Sun knew of the death of Sung Chʻien he was greatly pained and\r\nwept aloud.\r\n\r\nBut Chang Hung, the recorder, reproached him saying, “My lord, you\r\nrelied too much upon your martial prowess and lightly engaged in battle\r\nwith a formidable enemy. Every man in the army was chilled with fear\r\nand you lost a general and some of your banners. It is not for you to\r\nexhibit prowess on the actual battlefield and encroach upon the duties\r\nof a captain. Rather curb and repress such physical feats as those of\r\nMêng Pên and Hsia Yu and contemplate schemes of exercising princely\r\nvirtues with the hegemony of all the feudal states. It is because of\r\nyour ill-regulated action in engaging in battle that Sung Chʻien\r\nperished at the hands of your enemies. Hereafter you should regard as\r\nmost important your personal safety.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is indeed a fault,” said Sun Chʻüan. “I will reform.”\r\n\r\nSoon after Tʻaishih Tzŭ entered the tent and said, “In my command there\r\nis a certain Ko Ting, brother of a groom named Hou Tsʻao in the army of\r\nChang Liao. This Hou Tsʻao is deeply resentful on account of a\r\npunishment inflicted upon him and is anxious to be revenged. He has\r\nsent over to say that he will show a signal to-night when he has\r\nassassinated Chang Liao in revenge for the death of your late leader\r\nSung Chʻien. I wish to take some men over to await this signal to\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\n“Where is this Ko Ting?” asked Sun Chʻüan.\r\n\r\n“He has mingled with the enemy and gone into the city. Let me have five\r\ncompanies.”\r\n\r\nChuko Ching said, “Chang Liao is full of guile, I think you will find\r\nhim prepared for your coming. Be careful.”\r\n\r\nAs Tʻaishih Tzŭ urged his chief to let him go, and Sun Chʻüan was\r\ndeeply hurt by the death of his captain, the permission was given and\r\nthe force started.\r\n\r\nNow here it must be said that Tʻaishih Tzŭ and this Ko Ting were\r\nnatives of the same place. Ko had made his way into the city without\r\ndetection, found his brother and the two had arranged their plot. Ko\r\nalso told him that Tʻaishih Tzŭ would come over that night to help them\r\nand asked what they should do.\r\n\r\nHis brother, the groom, said, “As the men of Wu are far away I fear\r\nthey cannot be here to-night, so we will make a huge bonfire of straw\r\nand then you can rush out and cry treachery. That will throw all into\r\nconfusion and will give a chance to kill Chang Liao.”\r\n\r\n“This is an excellent plan,” said Ko Ting.\r\n\r\nNow after the victory Chang Liao returned to the city and rewarded his\r\nmen but he issued orders that no one was to doff his armour or sleep.\r\nHis attendants said, “You have gained a great victory to-day and the\r\nenemy are far away. You might doff your armour and get some repose.”\r\n\r\nBut Chang Liao replied, “That is not the way of a leader. A victory is\r\nno reason for rejoicing, nor should a defeat cause sadness. If the men\r\nof Wu suspect that I am unprepared, they will attack and we must be\r\nready to repel them. Be ready to-night and be doubly careful.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had he said this than a fire started and cries of “Treachery!”\r\narose. Many rushed to tell the leader, who went out and called together\r\nhis guard of about half a score. They took up a commanding position in\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nThose about him said, “The shouts are insistent; you ought to go and\r\nsee what it means.”\r\n\r\n“A whole city cannot be traitors,” said he. “Some discontented person\r\nhas frightened the soldiers. If I see any one doing so I will slay\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this Li Tien dragged up Ko Ting and his fellow-traitor.\r\nAfter a few brief questions they were beheaded. Then arose a great\r\nnoise, shouting and the rolling of drums was heard outside the gate.\r\n\r\n“That means the men of Wu are there to help,” said Chang Liao. “But we\r\nwill destroy them by a simple ruse.”\r\n\r\nHe bade them light torches and yell “Treachery! Rebellion!” and throw\r\nopen the city gates and let down the drawbridge.\r\n\r\nWhen Tʻaishih Tzŭ saw the gates swing open he thought his scheme was\r\ngoing well and in full confidence rode in at the gate. But just at the\r\nentrance a signal bomb suddenly exploded and the enemy arrows came down\r\non him like pelting rain. Then he knew he had fallen into a snare and\r\nturned to ride out. But he was wounded in many places. And in the\r\npursuit that followed more than half the men of Wu were cut off. As he\r\ndrew near his own lines a rescue force came to his aid and the Tsʻao\r\nsoldiers ceased from pursuit.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan was exceedingly sad when he learned that his faithful\r\ncaptain had been grievously wounded and when Chang Chao prayed him to\r\ncease from war he was content. They gathered in their men to their\r\nships and sailed to Nanhsü and Junchou where they camped.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tʻaishih Tzŭ was dying. When his lord sent to ask how he\r\nfared, he cried, “When a worthy man is born into a turbulent world, he\r\nhas to be a soldier and gird on a three feet sword. I have not rendered\r\ngreat service. Why must I die before I have attained my desire?”\r\n\r\nThese were his last words; he was forty-one years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Single minded and perfectly loyal,\r\n        Such was Tʻaishih, in Tunglai born,\r\n        Far distant frontiers rang with his exploits,\r\n        Riding or archery, all men he excelled,\r\n        One in Pohai who admired his valour\r\n        Cared for his mother while he was fighting,\r\n        How he joyed in the battle at Shêntʻing!\r\n        Dying, he spake as a hero;\r\n        All through the ages men sigh for his fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan was exceedingly grieved when this second of his leaders\r\ndied. He gave orders to bury his remains most honourably outside the\r\nnorth wall on Ku Hill and took his son, Tʻaishih Hsiang, into his own\r\npalace to be brought up.\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan-tê heard of the series of misfortunes that had befallen Wu\r\nand of their retirement to Nanhsü, he and Kʻung-ming discussed their\r\nplans. Said Kʻung-ming, “I was studying the sky and saw a falling star\r\nin the north-west. The Imperial family is to suffer a loss.”\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely said this when they brought news of the death of Liu\r\nChʻi, son of Liu Piao.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê at once began to wail bitterly. But his adviser said to him,\r\n“Life and death are beyond our control, wherefore weep not, my lord,\r\nfor grief harms the body. Rather consider what is necessary to be done.\r\nSend some one to assume control and make arrangements for the\r\ninterment.”\r\n\r\n“Who can go?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“No other than Kuan Yü.”\r\n\r\nSo they sent him to guard the city of Hsiangyang.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei at once began to feel troubled about his promise to surrender\r\nChingchou on the death of Liu Chʻi, but Kʻung-ming did not consider\r\nthis a matter of moment. He said he would have somewhat to say to any\r\none who came to ask fulfilment of the promise. In half a month it was\r\nannounced that Lu Su would come to mourn at the funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n        To claim the promise one will come,\r\n        But they will send him empty home.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat reply Kʻung-ming made may be read in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE DOWAGER MARCHIONESS SEES HER SON-IN-LAW AT A TEMPLE:\r\nLIU, THE IMPERIAL UNCLE, TAKES A WORTHY CONSORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan-tê and Kʻung-ming went out of the city to welcome the envoy of Wu\r\nand led him to the guest-house. After the usual greetings, Lu Su said,\r\n“Hearing of the death of your nephew, my lord has prepared some gifts\r\nand sent me to take his place at the funeral sacrifices. General Chou\r\nYü also sends greetings to the Imperial Uncle and to you, Master\r\nChuko.”\r\n\r\nBoth rose at once and thanked him for the courtesy. Then the gifts were\r\nhanded over and a banquet prepared, and while it was in progress, the\r\nguest brought up the real object of his visit.\r\n\r\n“You said, Sir, that Chingchou should be returned to us after the death\r\nof Liu Chʻi. Now that that event has happened rendition becomes due and\r\nI should be glad to know when the transfer can take place.”\r\n\r\n“We will discuss that later; in the meantime let us go on with our\r\nwine,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\nSo the feasting continued. Some time later Lu Su returned to the\r\nsubject, but this time his host remained silent. However, Kʻung-ming,\r\nchanging colour, said, “Tzŭ-ching, you are unreasonable. You should\r\nhave waited till some other spoke of this matter. From the very\r\nfoundation of the empire by our illustrious ancestor the great heritage\r\nhas descended in due course till to-day when, unhappily, evil-doers\r\nhave risen among the powerful and they have seized upon such portions\r\nas they could. But with God’s favour and help unity is nearly restored.\r\nMy lord is a scion of the Imperial house, a great great grandson of the\r\nEmperor Hsiao-Ching. Now, as the Emperor’s Uncle, should he not have a\r\nshare of the Empire? Moreover, Liu Ching-hsing (Liu Piao) was my lord’s\r\nelder brother and there is certainly nothing extraordinary in one\r\nbrother’s succession to another’s estate. What is your master? The son\r\nof a petty official on the banks of the Chʻientʻang River, absolutely\r\nwithout merit so far as the State is concerned. Just because he is\r\npowerful he holds actual possession of a certain amount of territory,\r\nwhich has whetted his insatiable appetite till he now desires to\r\nswallow the whole country. The land is the estate of the Liu family and\r\nmy lord, who is of that name, has no share thereof, while your master,\r\nwhose name is Sun, would dispute with, and even fight him. Beside, at\r\nthe battle at Chʻihpi (Red Wall) my lord did good service and acquired\r\ngreat merit while his captains risked their lives. Was it solely the\r\nstrength of your men of Wu that won that fight? Had I not brought that\r\nsouth-east wind that meant so much for Chou Yü, could he have done\r\nanything? Had Chiangnan been conquered, it is needless to say that two\r\nbeauties you wot of would now be gracing the Bronze Bird Palace, and as\r\nfor yourself, insignificant though your family be, could you have been\r\nsure to survive? Just now my lord did not reply because he was willing\r\nto believe rather that a scholar of your abilities would understand\r\nwithout a detailed explanation, and I trust now that you will.”\r\n\r\nThis speech absolutely shut the guest’s mouth for a time and he said no\r\nword in reply. But after an interval he said, “What you say,\r\nKʻung-ming, I think is devoid of reason, and means much unpleasantness\r\nfor me.”\r\n\r\n“What unpleasantness?” asked Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nThe guest replied, “When Liu Pei was in serious straits at Tangyang I\r\nconducted you across the river and introduced you to my lord. I opposed\r\nChou Yü when he was going to capture Chingchou, and then it came about\r\nthat the place was to be ours when the young man died. And I pledged\r\nmyself to that. Now how can I go back and say you break your promise?\r\nBoth my lord and Chou Yü will hold me guilty. I would not mind death so\r\nmuch, but I fear that my master will be very wrathful and make war on\r\nthe Imperial Uncle, who will have no place of refuge and he will look\r\nridiculous in the eyes of the world for no reason.”\r\n\r\nReplied Kʻung-ming, “I care not for Tsʻao Tsʻao with his hundred\r\nlegions and the Emperor in name at his back, and do you think I fear\r\nsuch a youngster as your Chou Yü? However, as it may cause you some\r\nloss of consideration I will try to persuade my master to put the\r\nmatter in writing and give you a paper to the effect that he is\r\ntemporarily occupying Chingchou as a base and when he can obtain\r\npossession of some other city this shall be returned to you. What think\r\nyou Wu would say to this?”\r\n\r\n“Wait till what other place was obtained?” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“My master can scarcely think of attacking the capital yet, but Liu\r\nChang in Ssŭchʻuan is ignorant and weak and my master will attack him.\r\nIf he get the western province then this place will be given up to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nLu Su had no alternative and accepted the offer. Yüan-tê with his own\r\nhand wrote the pledge and sealed it. Chuko Kʻung-ming being named as\r\nguarantor also signed the document.\r\n\r\n“Since I belong to this side of the compact and one can hardly have a\r\nguarantor of the same party I would trouble you, Tzŭ-ching, also to\r\nsign. It will look better when you reach Wu again,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nLu Su said, “I know that your master is perfectly honourable and will\r\nadhere to the bargain.”\r\n\r\nAnd so he signed. Then he received the document in formal style and\r\ntook his departure. He was sent off with every mark of great respect,\r\nboth Yüan-tê and Kʻung-ming attending him to his boat. There the\r\nadviser delivered him a last exhortation, “When you see your master,\r\nspeak discreetly and explain fully so as not to create a bad\r\nimpression. If he reject our document we may get angry and we will take\r\nhis whole country. The one thing now is for our two houses to live in\r\nharmony and not give our common enemy an opportunity against us.”\r\n\r\nLu Su went down into his ship. He reached Chʻaisang and there saw Chou\r\nYü, who said, “Well, how did you speed with your demand for Chingchou?”\r\n\r\n“Here is the document,” said Lu Su, giving it to Chou Yü to read.\r\n\r\n“You have been victimised by Chuko,” said Chou, stamping his foot with\r\nirritation. “In name it may be temporary occupation but in fact it is\r\nhumbug. They say the place is to be returned when they get the west.\r\nWho knows when that will be? Suppose ten years; then it will be ten\r\nyears before they give us Chingchou. What is the use of such a document\r\nas this? And you are a guarantor of its due performance! If they do not\r\ngive us the city, you get into trouble. Suppose our lord finds you in\r\nthe wrong, what then?”\r\n\r\nLu Su was dumbfounded. When he had somewhat recovered his\r\nself-possession, he said, “I think Yüan-tê will be true to me.”\r\n\r\n“You, my friend, are simple and sincere; Liu Pei is a scoundrelly\r\nadventurer; and Chuko Liang is a slippery customer. They and you are\r\nutterly different.”\r\n\r\n“What then is to be done?” cried Lu Su distressfully.\r\n\r\n“You are my dear friend and your kindness in freely offering your store\r\nof grain to relieve my necessity is still fresh in my memory. Of course\r\nI will save you. Do not be anxious, but wait a few days till we get\r\nnews of what is doing on the north of the river and then we can decide\r\nupon a plan.”\r\n\r\nLu Su passed some very uneasy days. Then the scouts came back saying\r\nthat in Chingchou everything seemed in excellent order and the flags\r\nwere flying everywhere, while outside the city they were building a\r\nmagnificent mausoleum for the Lady Kan, wife of Liu Pei. All the\r\nsoldiers were in mourning.\r\n\r\nWhen Chou Yü knew who was dead, he said to his friend, “My scheme is\r\nmade. You will see Liu Pei just stand still to be bound and we shall\r\nget Chingchou like turning a hand.”\r\n\r\n“What is the main-spring of your plan?” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“Liu Pei will want to re-marry and our lord has a sister. She is a\r\nveritable amazon, whose women guards number many hundreds, all armed\r\nwith weapons of war. Her apartments also are full of such things. I\r\nwill write to our lord to send an intermediary to arrange that the lady\r\nshall wed Liu Pei at her family home and thus we shall entice him to\r\nNanhsü. But instead of marrying a wife, he will find himself a\r\nprisoner, and then we will demand Chingchou as ransom. When they have\r\nhanded over the city I shall find something else to say and nothing\r\nwill fall on your head.”\r\n\r\nLu Su was very grateful. Then Chou Yü wrote letters to his master and a\r\nswift boat was chosen to take Lu Su to see the Marquis of Wu.\r\n\r\nAfter the lending of Chingchou had been discussed, Lu Su presented the\r\ndocument given him by Liu Pei. “What is the use of such nonsense as\r\nthis?” said Sun Chʻüan, when he had read it.\r\n\r\n“There is another letter from General Chou and he says that if you will\r\nemploy his scheme you can recover Chingchou,” replied Lu.\r\n\r\nHaving read that letter the Marquis was more pleased and began to\r\nconsider who was the best man to send. Suddenly he cried, “I have it;\r\nLü Fan is the man to send.”\r\n\r\nHe called Lü Fan and said to him, “I have just heard that Liu Yüan-tê\r\nhas lost his wife. I have a sister whom I should like to marry to him\r\nand so make a bond of union between our two houses. Thus we should be\r\nunited against Tsʻao and in support of the House of Han. You are the\r\none man to be intermediary and I hope you will go to Chingchou and see\r\nto this.”\r\n\r\nUnder these orders Lü Fan at once began to prepare his ships for the\r\nvoyage and soon started.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was greatly distressed at the death of the Lady Kan, fretting\r\nfor her day and night. One day when he was talking with his adviser\r\nthey announced the arrival of Lü Fan. He had come on a mission from Wu.\r\n\r\n“One of Chou Yü’s devices,” said the adviser smiling, “and it is all on\r\naccount of this city. I will just retire behind the screen and listen.\r\nBut you, my lord, agree to whatever the messenger proposes. Then let\r\nthe messenger be taken to the guest-house while we arrange what is to\r\nbe done.”\r\n\r\nSo the envoy was introduced. Bows having been exchanged, host and guest\r\nbeing seated in due order and the tea drunk, Yüan-tê opened the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n“You must have some commands for me, Sir, since you come thus.”\r\n\r\n“News has just been received that you, O Imperial Uncle, have just been\r\nbereaved of your consort. I venture to hope you would not object to an\r\nadvantageous match and I have come to propose one. Are you disposed to\r\nlisten?”\r\n\r\n“To lose one’s wife in middle age is truly a great misfortune,” said\r\nLiu Pei. “While her body is still warm I cannot listen to proposals for\r\nanother marriage.”\r\n\r\nLü Fan said, “A man without a wife is like a house without a ridge\r\npole. At your age one should not live an incomplete life. I am come on\r\nthe part of the Marquis of Wu, who has a sister, beautiful as she is\r\naccomplished and well fitted to be a mate for you. Should the two\r\nfamilies become allied as formerly were Tsʻin and Chin, then that\r\nruffian Tsʻao would never dare so much as look this way. Such an\r\nalliance would be to the benefit of both our houses and of the State. I\r\nhope, O Imperial Uncle, that you will fairly consider the proposal.\r\nHowever, since the young girl’s mother is dotingly fond of her she does\r\nnot wish her to go far away, and so I must ask you to come into our\r\ncountry for the wedding.”\r\n\r\n“Does the Marquis know of your coming?”\r\n\r\n“How dare I come without his knowledge?”\r\n\r\n“I am no longer young,” said Liu Pei. “I am fifty and grizzled. This\r\nfair damsel, the sister of the Marquis, is now in the flower of her\r\nyouth and no mate for me.”\r\n\r\n“Although the damsel is a woman yet in mind she surpasses many a man,\r\nand she has said she will never wed any one who is unknown to fame.\r\nNow, Sir, you are renowned throughout the four seas. Marriage with you\r\nwould be the chaste maiden mating with the born gentleman. Of what\r\nconsequence is the difference in age?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, stay here awhile and I will give you a reply to-morrow,” said Liu\r\nPei.\r\n\r\nSo that day the envoy was entertained at a banquet and then conducted\r\nto the guest house to repose, while, late as it was, Yüan-tê and\r\nKʻung-ming discussed their plans.\r\n\r\n“I knew what he had come about,” said the adviser. “While he was\r\ntalking I consulted the oracle and obtained an excellent sortilege.\r\nWherefore you may accept the proposal and send Sun Chʻien back with\r\nthis envoy to arrange the details. When the promise has been ratified\r\nwe will choose a day and you shall go to complete the ceremony.”\r\n\r\n“How can I thus go into enemy territory? Chou Yü has wanted to slay me\r\nfor a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Let Chou Yü employ all his ruses; think you he can get beyond me? Let\r\nme act for you and his calculations will always fail halfway. Once Sun\r\nChʻüan’s sister is in your power there will be no fear for Chingchou.”\r\n\r\nStill Yüan-tê doubted in his mind. However, the messenger was sent to\r\nWu, with definite instructions, and travelled thither with Lü Fan. At\r\nthe interview Sun Chʻüan said, “I wish my sister could induce Yüan-tê\r\nto live here with us. He would come to no harm.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻien took his leave, and returning to Chingchou he told the\r\nbridegroom elect that Sun Chʻüan’s sole desire was for him to go over\r\nand complete the marriage.\r\n\r\nHowever, Yüan-tê feared and would not go. Kʻung-ming said he had\r\nprepared three plans but they needed Chao Tzŭ-lung to carry them out.\r\nWherefore he must go as guard. So he called in Chao Yün, gave him three\r\nsilken bags and whispered in his ear saying, “Here are three schemes\r\nenclosed in three bags. When you escort our lord to Wu you will take\r\nthese with you and act as they direct.”\r\n\r\nChao Yün hid the three silken bags in his breast so that they should be\r\nat hand when required.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming next sent the wedding gifts, and when these had been\r\nreceived the preliminaries were settled.\r\n\r\nIt was then the early winter of the fourteenth year of “Established\r\nTranquillity” (209 A.D.) and the bridegroom elect, his escort and the\r\nintermediary, left Chingchou with a fleet of ten fast ships to sail\r\ndown the river to Nanhsü. Kʻung-ming remained to guard and rule the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nBut Liu Pei was far from feeling comfortable. They arrived and the\r\nships were made fast. This done the time had come for the first of the\r\nsilken bags to be opened. And so it was; and thereupon Chao Yün gave\r\neach of the soldiers of his half company his instructions and they went\r\ntheir several ways. Next he told Liu Pei what he was to do; that he was\r\nto pay his visit first to Chʻiao “Kuo-lao,” who was the father-in-law\r\nof Sun Tsʻê and of Chou Yü. He resided in Nanhsü and to his house,\r\n“leading sheep and bearing wine jars,” went the bridegroom elect.\r\nHaving made his obeisance he explained that as Lü Fan had arranged he\r\nhad come to marry a wife.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the half company of the escort, all in gala dress, had\r\nscattered over the town buying all sorts of things, as they said, for\r\nthe wedding of Liu Pei with the daughter of the House of Wu. They\r\nspread the news far and wide and the whole town talked about it.\r\n\r\nWhen Sun Chʻüan heard of Yüan-tê’s arrival he bade Lü Fan wait upon him\r\nand take him to the guest-house. Meanwhile Chʻiao Kuo-lao went to the\r\nDowager of Wu, mother of Sun Chʻüan, to congratulate her on the happy\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n“What happy event?” ejaculated the old lady.\r\n\r\n“The betrothal of your beloved daughter to Yüan-tê. And he has arrived\r\ntoo, as surely you know.”\r\n\r\n“My poor old self does not know,” said the Dowager, “I have heard\r\nnothing of all this.”\r\n\r\nShe at once summoned her son and also sent her servants out into the\r\ntown to see what was going about. They quickly returned to say that the\r\nwhole town knew of the coming wedding, and the bridegroom was then at\r\nthe guest-house. Moreover, he had come with a large escort and the men\r\nwere spending freely, buying pork and mutton and fruits, all in\r\nreadiness for the wedding feasting. They also told her the names of the\r\nintermediaries on each side, and said they were in the guest-house too.\r\n\r\nThe Dowager was terribly taken aback and upset so that, when Sun Chʻüan\r\narrived, he found his mother beating her breast and weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n“What has disturbed you, mother,” asked he.\r\n\r\n“What you have just done,” said she. “You have treated me as a\r\nnonentity. When my elder sister lay dying, what did she tell you?”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan began to be frightened, but he said boldly, “Please speak\r\nout plainly, mother; what is this great sorrow?”\r\n\r\n“When a son is grown he takes a wife, and when a girl is old enough she\r\ngoes to her husband. And that is right and proper. But I am the mother\r\nand you ought to have told me that your sister was to become the wife\r\nof Liu Pei. Why did you keep me in the dark? It was my place to promise\r\nher in marriage.”\r\n\r\n“Whence comes this story?” said the Marquis, really much frightened.\r\n\r\n“Do you pretend ignorance? There is not a soul in the city who does not\r\nknow! But you have succeeded in keeping me in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“I heard it several days ago,” said Chʻiao. “And I came just now to\r\noffer my felicitations.”\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing,” said Sun. “It is just one of the ruses of\r\nChou Yü to get hold of Chingchou. He has used this means to inveigle\r\nLiu Pei here and hold him captive till Chingchou is restored to us. And\r\nif they will not give it back, then Liu Pei will be put to death. That\r\nis the plot. There is no real marriage.”\r\n\r\nBut the Dowager was in a rage and vented her wrath in abusing Chou Yü.\r\n“He is a pretty sort of a governor over the eighty-one districts if he\r\ncannot find any means of recovering one city except making use of my\r\nchild as a decoy. Truly this is a fine deed, to spoil the whole of my\r\nchild’s life and condemn her to perpetual widowhood because he wants to\r\nuse the fair damsel ruse to slay a man! Who will ever come to talk of\r\nmarriage with her after this?”\r\n\r\nSaid Chʻiao Kuo-lao, “By this means you may indeed recover Chingchou\r\nbut you will be a shameful laughing stock to all the world. What can be\r\ndone?”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan had nothing to say; he could only hang his head, while the\r\nDowager abused his general.\r\n\r\nChʻiao tried to soothe her. “After all Liu, the Imperial Uncle, is a\r\nscion of the reigning family. You can do nothing better now than to\r\nwelcome him as a son-in-law and not let this ugly story get abroad.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid their ages do not match,” interposed Sun Chʻüan.\r\n\r\n“Liu is a very famous man,” said Chʻiao. “There can be no shame in\r\nhaving such a son-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“I have never seen him,” said the Dowager. “Arrange that I may get a\r\nlook at him to-morrow at the Gentle Dew Temple. If he displeases me,\r\nyou may work your will on him. But if I am satisfied with him then I\r\nshall simply let the girl marry him.”\r\n\r\nNow Sun Chʻüan was above all things filial and at once agreed to what\r\nhis mother said. He went out, called in Lü Fan and told him to arrange\r\na banquet for the morrow at the temple so that the Dowager might see\r\nthe bridegroom.\r\n\r\n“Why not order Chia Hua to station some men in the wings of the temple?\r\nThen if the Dowager be not pleased we can call them out and fall upon\r\nhim,” said Lü Fan.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the ambush was prepared and ruffians posted to act as the\r\nDowager’s attitude might determine.\r\n\r\nWhen Chʻiao took his leave and had reached his house, he sent to tell\r\nYüan-tê that on the morrow the Dowager wished to see him and she was\r\nwell disposed.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê and his faithful henchman discussed their plans. Chao Yün said,\r\n“The morrow bodes rather ill than well. However, the escort shall be\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nNext day the Dowager and Chʻiao went to the Temple of Gentle Dew as had\r\nbeen arranged. Sun Chʻüan came with a number of his strategists, and\r\nwhen all were assembled Lü Fan was sent to the guest house to request\r\nYüan-tê to come. He obeyed the summons, but as a precaution he put on a\r\nlight coat of mail under his brocaded robe. His followers too took\r\ntheir swords upon their backs and followed close. He mounted his steed\r\nand the cavalcade set out for the temple. At the door of the temple he\r\nmet Sun Chʻüan on whom the visitor’s brave demeanour was not lost.\r\nAfter they had exchanged salutations, Sun led Liu Pei into the presence\r\nof his mother.\r\n\r\n“Just the son-in-law for me!” said the Dowager delighted with the\r\nappearance of Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“He has the air of an emperor and a look like the sun,” remarked\r\nChʻiao. “When one remembers also that his fair fame has spread over the\r\nwhole earth, you may well be congratulated on getting such a noble\r\nson-in-law.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei bowed, in acknowledgment of his reception. Soon after they were\r\nall seated at the banquet in the temple, Chao Yün entered and took his\r\nplace beside Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“Who is this?” asked the Dowager.\r\n\r\n“This is Chao Yün of Chʻangshan.”\r\n\r\n“Then he must be the hero of Tangyang Slope, who saved the little\r\nO-tou.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; this is he,” replied Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“A fine captain!” said the Dowager, and she gave him wine.\r\n\r\nPresently Chao Yün said to his master, “I have seen a lot of armed\r\nruffians hidden away in the purlieus of the temple. They can be there\r\nfor no good and you should ask the Dowager to get them sent away.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Liu Pei knelt at the feet of the Dowager and, weeping, said,\r\n“If you would slay me, let it be here.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say this?” asked she.\r\n\r\n“Because there are assassins in hiding in the wings of the temple; what\r\nare they there for if not to kill me?”\r\n\r\nThe Dowager wrathfully turned on Sun Chʻüan. “What are armed men doing\r\nthere to-day when Yüan-tê is to become my son-in-law and the pair are\r\nmy son and daughter?”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan said he did not know and sent Lü Fan to enquire. Lü Fan put\r\nthe blame on Chia Hua. The Dowager summoned him and upbraided him\r\nseverely. He had nothing to say and she told them to put him to death.\r\nBut Yüan-tê interceded saying that it would do him harm and make it\r\nhard for him to stay at her side.\r\n\r\nChʻiao Kuo-lao also interceded and she only ordered the captain out of\r\nher presence. His men also scattered and ran like frightened rats.\r\n\r\nBy and bye, strolling out of the banquet room into the temple grounds,\r\nYüan-tê came to a boulder. Drawing his sword he looked up to heaven and\r\nprayed saying, “If I am to return to Chingchou and achieve my intent to\r\nbecome a chief ruler, then may I cleave this boulder asunder with my\r\nsword, but if I am to meet my doom in this place then may the sword\r\nfail to cut this stone.”\r\n\r\nRaising his sword he smote the boulder. Sparks flew in all directions;\r\nand the boulder lay cleft in twain.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Sun Chʻüan had seen the blow and he said, “Why do you\r\nthus hate that stone?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “I am near my fifth decade and have so far failed to\r\nrid the State of evil; I greatly regret my failure. Now I have been\r\naccepted by the Dowager as her son-in-law, and this is a critical\r\nmoment in my life. So I implored of Heaven a portent that I might\r\ndestroy Tsʻao as I would that boulder and restore the dynasty. You saw\r\nwhat happened.”\r\n\r\n“That is only to blind me,” thought Sun. Drawing his own sword he said,\r\n“And I also ask of Heaven an omen, that if I am to destroy Tsʻao I may\r\nalso cut this rock.”\r\n\r\nSo he spoke. But in his secret heart he prayed “If I am to recover\r\nChingchou and extend my borders, may the stone be cut in twain.”\r\n\r\nHe smote the stone and it split in twain. And to this day there are\r\ncross cuts in the stone, which is still preserved.\r\n\r\nOne who saw this relic wrote a poem:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        The shining blades fell and the rock was shorn through,\r\n        The metal rang clear and the sparks widely flew.\r\n        Thus fate then declared for the dynasties two\r\n        And the tripartite rule there began.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth put up their swords and returned hand in hand to the banquet hall.\r\nAfter some more courses Sun Chʻüan gave his master a warning look and\r\nLiu Pei said, “I pray you to excuse me as my drinking powers are very\r\nsmall.” Wherefore Sun Chʻüan escorted him to the gate. As they walked\r\ndown looking at high land and rolling river spreading in glorious\r\npanorama before their eyes, Yüan-tê exclaimed, “Really this is the\r\nfinest scene in the whole world!”\r\n\r\nThese words are recorded on a tablet in the Temple of the Gentle Dew\r\nand one who read them wrote a poem:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        From the river-side hills the rain clears off,\r\n            And the black clouds roll away,\r\n        And this is the place of joy and mirth\r\n            And never can sorrow stay.\r\n        And here two heroes of ages past\r\n            Decided their parts to play,\r\n        And the lofty heights flung back wind and wave\r\n            Then, as they do to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, they stood both entranced by the beautiful scene. And gradually\r\nalong the vast river the wind whipped the waves into snowy foam and\r\nraised them high toward heaven. And in the midst of the waves appeared\r\na tiny leaf of a boat riding over the waves as if all was perfect calm.\r\n\r\n“The southern people are sailors and the northern men riders; it is\r\nquite true,” sighed Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan hearing this remark took it as a reproach to his\r\nhorsemanship. Bidding his servants lead up his steed he leaped into the\r\nsaddle and set off, full gallop, down the hill. Then wheeling he came\r\nup again at the same speed.\r\n\r\n“So the southerners cannot ride, eh?” said he laughing.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone Liu Pei lifted the skirts of his robe, jumped upon\r\nhis horse and repeated the feat.\r\n\r\nThe two steeds stood side by side on the declivity, the riders\r\nflourishing their whips and laughing.\r\n\r\nThence forward that hillside was known as the “Slope where the Horses\r\nStood” and a poem was written about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Their galloping steeds were of noble breed,\r\n            And both of spirit high.\r\n        And the riders twain from the hill-crest gazed\r\n            At the river rolling by.\r\n        One of them mastered the far off west.\r\n            One ruled by the eastern sea;\r\n        And the name of the hill to this very day\r\n            Brings back their memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they rode side by side into Nanhsü the people met them with\r\nacclamations. Yüan-tê made his way to the guesthouse and there sought\r\nadvice from Sun Chʻien as to the date of the wedding. Sun Chʻien\r\nadvised that it be fixed as early as possible so that no further\r\ncomplications could arise. So next day Yüan-tê went to Chʻiao “Kuo-lao”\r\nand told him in plain words that it was clear the people of the place\r\nmeant harm to him and he could not stay there long. He must return\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n“Do not be anxious,” said Chʻiao. “I will tell the Dowager and she will\r\nprotect you.”\r\n\r\nHe saw the Dowager and she was very angry when she heard the reason for\r\nLiu Pei’s desire to leave.\r\n\r\n“Who would dare harm my son-in-law?” cried she.\r\n\r\nBut she made him move into the library of the Palace as a precaution\r\nand she chose a day for the celebration of the wedding. But his\r\nsoldiers could not keep guard at the library. Yüan-tê explained to his\r\nhostess and when she understood this she gave her son-in-law rooms in\r\nher own Palace so that he might be quite safe.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê was very happy and there were fine banquets and the bride and\r\nbridegroom duly plighted their troth. And when it grew late and the\r\nguests had gone the newly wedded pair walked through the two lines of\r\nred torches to the nuptial apartment.\r\n\r\nTo his extreme surprise Yüan-tê found the chambers furnished with\r\nspears and swords and banners and flags, while every waiting-maid had\r\ngirded on a sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Walls hung with spears the bridegroom saw,\r\n            And armed waiting-maids;\r\n        His heart fell back on all its fears\r\n            Of well-laid ambuscades.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happened will be related in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nYÜAN-TÊ ROUSES THE SPIRIT OF HIS BRIDE:\r\nKʻUNG-MING A SECOND TIME ANGERS HIS RIVAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom turned pale; bridal apartments lined with weapons of war\r\nand waiting maids armed! But the housekeeper said, “Do not be\r\nfrightened, O honourable one. My lady has always had a taste for\r\nwarlike things and her maids have all been taught fencing as a pastime.\r\nThat is all it is.”\r\n\r\n“Not the sort of thing a wife should ever look at,” said Liu Pei. “It\r\nmakes me feel cold and you may have them removed for a time.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper went to her mistress and said, “The weapons in your\r\nchamber displease the handsome one; may we remove them?”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Sun laughed, saying, “Afraid of a few weapons after half a\r\nlife time spent in slaughter!”\r\n\r\nBut she ordered their removal and bade the maids take off their swords\r\nwhile they were at work. And the night passed happily enough.\r\n\r\nNext day Yüan-tê distributed gifts among the maids to secure their good\r\nwill. He also sent Sun Chʻien to Chingchou with news of the wedding,\r\nwhile he gave himself up to feasting and enjoyment. The Dowager loved\r\nhim more every day.\r\n\r\nThe results of the plot to destroy Liu Pei were thus very different\r\nfrom the originators’ intention. Sun Chʻüan sent to his general to say\r\nthat his mother had insisted upon marrying her daughter to their\r\nproposed victim and so by juggling with the fictitious they had made it\r\nreal. What was to be done?\r\n\r\nThe news troubled Chou Yü, but eventually he thought out another scheme\r\nwhich he embodied in a letter sent to his master. Here is the outline\r\nof the missive:—“Contrary to expectation the plot that I, Chou Yü,\r\ncontrived has turned the wrong way. However, since by juggling with\r\ndeceit we have ended in a solid truth our future plans must start from\r\nthe actual present facts. To the boldness of the adventurer is added\r\nthe aid of such great captains as Kuan, Chang and Chao Yün, not to\r\nmention that Liu Pei has a strategist like Chuko. He is not the man to\r\nremain long in a lowly position. Wherefore I can think of no better\r\nplan than to enervate him by surrounding him with softness and keeping\r\nhim in Wu, a prisoner of luxury. Therefore build for him a fine Palace\r\nto blunt the edge of his determination and surround him with sensuous\r\nluxury. In this way the affection of his brothers will be alienated and\r\nChuko will be driven away. When this result has been attained we can\r\nsmite him and so end a great matter. If we be at all careless I fear\r\nthe recumbent dragon may fly to the skies; it is no beast to be kept in\r\na pond.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I pray you to consider this thoroughly.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was shown to Chang Chao who said, “My idea is identical with\r\nhis. Liu Pei began life in a humble position and for years has been a\r\nwanderer. He has never tasted the delights of wealth. Give him the\r\nmeans of luxury, a beautiful dwelling, fair women, gold and silken\r\nattire, and as he enjoys them the thoughts of Kʻung-ming and his\r\nbrothers will fade away and they, on their side, will be filled with\r\nrancour. Thus can we lay our plans for recovering Chingchou. I\r\nrecommend action as Chou Yü says and quickly.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan then set about re-decorating the eastern Palace and laying\r\nout the grounds. He filled the rooms with beautiful furniture for his\r\nsister and her husband. He also sent fair damsels and musicians by the\r\nscore, and many and beautiful vessels in gold and silver, and silken\r\nstuffs. And his mother was delighted at his kindness to her son-in-law.\r\n\r\nIndeed Liu Pei was soon so immersed in sensuous pleasure that he gave\r\nno thought to return. Chao Yün and the company under him led an idle\r\nlife in the front portion of the eastern Palace, save that at times\r\nthey went outside the city for archery and horse-racing. And thus\r\npassed the year.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Chao Yün remembered the orders he had received and the three\r\nbags with the plans in them. It was time to open the second one for the\r\nend of the year was nigh. His orders were only to open the third when\r\ndanger was very near and there appeared no way out.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the year was drawing to a close and Chao Yün saw\r\nhis lord daily becoming more and more the slave of pleasure. Liu Pei\r\nnever appeared among his guards now. So the bag was opened and in\r\npursuance of the wonderful scheme thereby discovered, Chao Yün went to\r\nthe hall of the Palace and asked to see his master. The maid in\r\nattendance went within and said, “Chao Yün has some important matter on\r\nwhich to see the master.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê called him in and asked what the business was. Chao Yün assumed\r\nan attitude of great concern and said, “My lord, you are living happily\r\nsecluded in these beautiful apartments; do you never think of\r\nChingchou?”\r\n\r\n“But what is the matter that you seem so disturbed?” asked Liu.\r\n\r\n“To-day early Kʻung-ming sent a messenger to say that Tsʻao Tsʻao was\r\ntrying to avenge his last defeat and was leading fifty legions to\r\nattack Chingchou, which was in great danger. And he wished you to\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n“I must speak to my wife,” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“If you consult her she will be unwilling for you to return. It would\r\nbe better to say nothing but to start this evening. Delay may do great\r\ndamage.”\r\n\r\n“Retire for a time; I must act discreetly,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nChao Yün urged the need to return several times more, but finally went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê went into his wife’s rooms and began to weep silently. Seeing\r\nhis tears the Lady Sun said, “Why are you so sad, my husband?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê replied, “I have been driven hither and thither all my life. I\r\nwas never able to do my duty to my parents nor have I been able to\r\nsacrifice to my ancestors. I have been very unfilial. The new year is\r\nat hand and its approach disquiets me greatly.”\r\n\r\n“Do not try to deceive me,” said the Lady Sun. “I heard and I know all.\r\nJust now Chao Yün came to tell you Chingchou was threatened and you\r\nwish to return home. That is why you put forward this excuse.”\r\n\r\nThen Yüan-tê fell on his knees and said, “Why should I dissemble, O\r\nwife, since you know? I do not wish to go, but if Chingchou be lost I\r\nshall be an object of ridicule to every one. I do desire to go, but I\r\ncannot leave you. Now you know why I am grieved.”\r\n\r\nShe replied, “I am your handmaid and whithersoever you go it is my duty\r\nto follow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; your heart is right, but the difficulty is your mother and the\r\nMarquis; they will be unwilling. If you would have pity on me and let\r\nme go for a time——.”\r\n\r\nAnd again the tears gushed forth.\r\n\r\n“Do not be so sad, my husband,” said the Lady Sun. “I will implore my\r\nmother to let us go and she will surely allow it.”\r\n\r\n“Even supposing the Dowager permits I am sure the Marquis will hinder.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Sun said nothing for a long time while she weighed the matter\r\nthoroughly. Presently she spoke, “On New Year’s Day you and I will go\r\nto court and present our congratulations. Then we will give the excuse\r\nof a sacrifice on the river bank and go away without formal leave. Will\r\nthat suit you?”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê knelt at her feet and expressed his gratitude. “I should be\r\nnever so grateful,” said he. “Dead or alive I would remember your love.\r\nBut this must be a perfect secret.”\r\n\r\nThis having been decided and the arrangements made, Chao Yün received\r\nsecret orders to lead out his company and be on the road on New Year’s\r\nmorn. He was told they were going away.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan held a grand court on the New Year’s Day of the fifteenth\r\nyear of “Established Tranquillity.” Liu Pei and his bride went into the\r\nDowager’s presence and the Lady Sun said, “My husband has been thinking\r\nof his ancestors, who lie in Cho, and grieves that he cannot do his\r\nduty by them. To-day we wish to go to the river side and offer\r\nsacrifices toward the north. It is our duty to inform you.”\r\n\r\n“A very filial proceeding,” said the Dowager. “I should not think of\r\nstopping you. Although you have never known your husband’s parents yet\r\nyou may go with him to sacrifice as it is proper for a wife to do.”\r\n\r\nBoth thanked the Dowager and went out, rejoicing at having so far\r\nhoodwinked Sun Chʻüan. The Lady Sun got into her carriage taking only a\r\nlittle clothing with her, while Yüan-tê followed with a small escort.\r\nThey went out of the city and met Chao Yün at the place arranged. Then\r\nwith a guard in front and rear they left the precincts of the city,\r\ntravelling as quickly as they could.\r\n\r\nThat day, at the new year banquet, Sun Chʻüan drank freely so that he\r\nhad to be helped to his chamber, and the guests left. Before very long\r\nthe escape of the fugitives became known, but it was then dark and when\r\nthey tried to tell Sun Chʻüan they could not rouse him. He slept\r\nheavily until the fifth watch.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Sun Chʻüan heard the story he asked advice of\r\nhis counsellors. Chang Shao said, “They have got away to-day but\r\ntrouble will surely come of it; therefore pursue after them without\r\nloss of time.”\r\n\r\nSo Chʻên Wu and Pʻan Chang, with a half-company of veterans, were sent\r\nout with orders to use all speed both by day and by night and bring\r\nback the fugitives.\r\n\r\nThey left. Sun Chʻüan’s anger burned hot against Yüan-tê. In his wrath\r\nhe seized his jade inkstone and dashed it to the ground where it\r\nshivered to pieces.\r\n\r\nSaid Chʻêng Pʻu, “My lord, your wrath is in vain, for I do not think\r\nyour men will catch the runaways.”\r\n\r\n“Will they dare to disobey my order?” said Sun Chʻüan.\r\n\r\n“Our young lady had always delighted to look upon war and is very\r\nfierce and determined. All the officers fear her. Now she has gone with\r\nher husband of her own free will and those sent in pursuit, if once\r\nthey look upon her countenance, will not dare to lay hands on her.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan’s wrath burned the more fiercely at these words. He drew the\r\nsword girded at his side and called up Chiang Chʻin and Chou Tʻai\r\nsaying, “You two take this sword and bring back the heads of my sister\r\nand Liu Pei. And if you do not I will put you to death.”\r\n\r\nWith this order they set out in pursuit, leading a whole company.\r\nMeanwhile Yüan-tê and his wife were pressing forward with all speed.\r\nWhen night fell they rested for a time by the roadside, but not for\r\nlong. Just as they reached the confines of Chʻaisang they turned and\r\nsaw a great cloud of dust and the soldiers said that a force was coming\r\nin pursuit.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do if they come up with us?” said Yüan-tê excitedly to\r\nChao Yün.\r\n\r\n“My lord, you go on in front and I will prevent pursuit.”\r\n\r\nAs they turned the foot of a hill they saw a troop of soldiers blocking\r\ntheir road in front. Two captains were there and they bellowed, “Liu\r\nPei, dismount and yield yourself captive. We are here by order of\r\nGeneral Chou and you have kept us waiting long.”\r\n\r\nNow the thought had come to Chou Yü that Yüan-tê would try to flee, and\r\nso he had sent Hsü Shêng and Ting Fêng, with three companies, to\r\nintercept him at this critical spot. They had made a camp there and\r\nkept a lookout from the hill-tops, for Chou had calculated that he\r\nwould certainly pass that way. So when Liu Pei and his cavalcade\r\nappeared they all buckled on their arms and barred the way.\r\n\r\nGreatly fearing, Yüan-tê rode back to consult Chao Yün, to whom he\r\nsaid, “In front a force barring the road; in rear pursuers. There is no\r\nescape. What can we do?”\r\n\r\n“Do not be alarmed, my lord. The great strategist gave me three plans\r\nenclosed in three silken bags. Two have been used and have answered\r\nadmirably. There is yet the third and my orders were to open the bag in\r\nsuch a strait as this. This is a day of great danger such as calls me\r\nto open the bag.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he opened the bag and handed it to Yüan-tê. As soon as\r\nYüan-tê had seen the contents he hastened to the Lady Sun’s carriage\r\nand began to weep, saying, “I have something private to say, and I must\r\ntell you.”\r\n\r\n“What have you to tell me, my husband? Tell me the whole truth,”\r\nreplied she.\r\n\r\n“Your brother and Chou Yü formerly made a plot for you to marry me, not\r\nfor your sake, but to get me into their power and hold me so that they\r\nmight recover Chingchou. They were set on my murder, and you were the\r\nbait with which to hook me. Careless of consequences I came, for I knew\r\nthat the spirit of a man dwelt in your bosom and you would pity me.\r\nLately I heard that harm was intended me and so I made danger to\r\nChingchou the excuse to escape. Happily for me you have remained true\r\nand come with me. But now the Marquis is pursuing us and Chou Yü’s men\r\nare in front. Only you, my wife, can extricate us from this danger and\r\nif you refuse, then slay me where I stand that I may thus show my\r\ngratitude for your kindness.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Sun grew angry and said, “Then does my brother forget that I\r\nam his sister? How will he ever look me in the face? I can extricate us\r\nfrom this danger.”\r\n\r\nThereupon she bade her people push the carriage to the front. She\r\nrolled up the blind and herself called out, “Hsü Shêng, Ting Fêng, are\r\nyou turned traitors then?”\r\n\r\nThe two captains slid out of their saddles, dropped their arms and\r\nstood meekly in front of the carriage.\r\n\r\n“We are no traitors,” said they. “We have the General’s orders to camp\r\nhere and await Liu Pei.”\r\n\r\n“Chou Yü is an interfering scoundrel,” cried she. “We of the land of Wu\r\nhave never harmed you, and Yüan-tê, the Uncle of the Great Family, is\r\nmy husband. I have already told my mother and my brother of our journey\r\nand now I find you with an army at the foot of these hills preventing\r\nour passage. Is it that you would plunder us of our valuables?”\r\n\r\nThe two captains mumbled dissent; they would not dare such a thing. “We\r\npray you, O Lady, to stay your anger. This is no plan of ours; we do\r\nbut obey our General’s orders.”\r\n\r\n“So you fear Chou Yü and not me!” cried she scornfully. “Think you that\r\nif he slay you I will not slay him?”\r\n\r\nShe broke into a torrent of abuse of Chou Yü. Then she bade them push\r\nher carriage forward.\r\n\r\nThe two leaders thought within themselves, “We are but men of lowly\r\nrank, we dare not dispute with the Lady Sun.” Beside they saw Chao Yün\r\nwas bursting with wrath. So they ordered their men to stand aside and\r\nleave the road clear.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade had only gone a little distance when up came the\r\npursuers. The two captains told the new-comers what had happened. “You\r\nwere wrong to let them pass,” said Chʻên and Pʻan. “We have orders from\r\nthe Marquis himself to arrest them.”\r\n\r\nThereupon all four went in pursuit. When the noise of the approaching\r\nforce reached the ears of Yüan-tê he said to his wife, “They are again\r\npursuing us; what now?”\r\n\r\n“Husband, go on in front. I and Chao Yün will keep them off.”\r\n\r\nSo Yüan-tê and a small company went on toward the river bank, while\r\nChao Yün reined up beside the lady’s carriage and set out his men ready\r\nfor battle. And when the four men came up they dismounted and stood\r\nwith folded arms.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here, Captains?” asked the Lady Sun.\r\n\r\n“We have orders from our lord to request you and Yüan-tê to return.”\r\n\r\nCalmly but bitterly she said, “So this is the sort of fools you are!\r\nYou would make dissension between brother and sister. But I am a wife\r\non my way to my husband’s home. Nor am I leaving clandestinely, for I\r\nhad my mother’s gracious permission. Now we, husband and wife, are\r\ngoing to Chingchou and if even my brother were here himself he would\r\nlet us pass in all politeness. But you, because you have weapons in\r\nyour hands, would slay us!”\r\n\r\nShe abused the four men to their faces so that they looked from one to\r\nanother in shame. And each in his heart thought, “Say what one will,\r\nafter all they two are brother and sister and the Dowager is the\r\ncontrolling power. Sun Chʻüan is most obedient and would never dare\r\noppose his mother’s decision. When the reaction comes, then indeed we\r\nshall certainly be found in the wrong. We had better be kind.” Another\r\nthing was that one of the two they sought, Yüan-tê, was not there and\r\nChao Yün looked angry and dangerous. Finally, muttering to themselves,\r\nthey gave way and with one accord retired and left the road open. The\r\nLady Sun passed through.\r\n\r\n“We four will go to see the General and report,” said Hsü Shêng.\r\n\r\nBut that did not please them all and they stood irresolute. Presently\r\nthey saw a column of men sweeping down on them like a hurricane. These\r\nwere Chiang and Chou with their company.\r\n\r\n“Have you fellows seen Liu Pei?” they cried as they rushed up.\r\n\r\n“He has just passed along.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not arrest him?”\r\n\r\n“Because of what the Lady Sun said.”\r\n\r\n“That is just as the Marquis feared and so he gave us this sword and\r\ntold us first to slay his sister and then Liu Pei. And if we disobey he\r\nwill put us to death.”\r\n\r\n“What can be done? They are far away by now.”\r\n\r\nChiang Chʻin said, “After all they are but a few and on foot; they\r\ncannot travel very fast. Let Hsü and Ting go to Chou Yü to tell him,\r\nand he can send fast boats to pursue them on the river while we follow\r\nup on the bank. We must get them either on water or land and we must\r\nnot listen to what they say.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon two went back to report and two to the river bank. Meanwhile\r\nLiu Pei had got a long way from Chʻaisang and reached Liulangpu. He now\r\nfelt calmer. He went along the bank of the river seeking a boat, but\r\nthere was no craft on the broad bosom of the stream. He bowed his head\r\nin deep sorrow. Chao Yün bade him be of good courage seeing that he had\r\njust escaped from the tiger’s jaws and had not far to go.\r\n\r\n“I suspect Kʻung-ming has something prepared for us,” said he.\r\n\r\nBut his master was despondent. His thoughts were back to the pleasures\r\nhe had enjoyed but a few hours since in the house of his wife, and the\r\ntears rolled down his cheeks. A poem has been written on this episode.\r\n\r\n\r\n        By the bank of the deep flowing Yangtse\r\n            Once was a wedding,\r\n        And the ruling houses of two states yet to be\r\n            Were allied by marriage.\r\n        See the beautiful maiden stepping slowly\r\n            To the golden bridal chamber!\r\n        Yet was the marriage but a ruse.\r\n            Its author vainly imagined that a hero,\r\n        Sinking in amorous toils,\r\n            Would forget his high intent and great resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan-tê bade the captain of his guard go along the bank to seek some\r\nboats. Then the soldiers told him there was a huge cloud of dust on the\r\nroad. Ascending one of the hills he looked back whence they had come\r\nand saw the whole earth as it were covered with an advancing host. He\r\nsighed and said, “We have fled before them now for days, worn out our\r\nmen and jaded our horses, and all to die in a strange place.”\r\n\r\nHe watched them coming nearer and nearer. Then as things began to look\r\nmost desperate he saw a line of some twenty boats all in the act of\r\nsetting their sails.\r\n\r\n“By good luck here are some ships,” said Chao Yün. “Let us get on\r\nboard, row to the further bank and see what can be done.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê and his bride hastened down the bank and went into a ship. The\r\nsoldiers were embarked. Then they saw in the hold of the ship some one\r\nin Taoist dress, who came up with a smile, saying, “My lord, again you\r\nsee Chuko Liang. He has waited a long time.”\r\n\r\nAll the men on board were from Chingchou, and Yüan-tê rejoiced at the\r\nsudden happy turn of affairs.\r\n\r\nBefore long the pursuers reached the bank. Kʻung-ming pointed to them\r\nand laughed, saying, “I foresaw this a long time ago. You may return\r\nand tell your General not to use the fair damsel trick again.”\r\n\r\nThose on the bank sent a flight of arrows at the ships but they were\r\nalready too far away. The four officers on the bank looked very\r\nfoolish.\r\n\r\nAs the boats were sailing along a great noise was heard on the river\r\nbehind them and there appeared a huge fleet of war ships, sailing under\r\nthe flag of Chou Yü. He also was there in command of the fleet and he\r\nwas supported by Huang Kai and Han Tang. They seemed like a drove of\r\nhorses and came along swift as a falling star. They gained on the\r\nfugitives rapidly.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming ordered the boats to row over to the north bank, and the\r\nparty landed. They had started off away from the shore before Chou Yü\r\ncould land. Chou Yü’s men, naturally, were all afoot but they kept up\r\nthe pursuit, following as quickly as they could. When they reached the\r\nborders of Huangchou, Liu Pei and his party were not far away, and so\r\nthey pressed the pursuit. But there were only horses for a few in front\r\nand suddenly the rolling of drums struck Chou Yü’s ears and from out a\r\ngully dashed a troop of swordsmen led by Kuan Yü. Chou Yü was too\r\nsurprised and unprepared to do anything but flee.\r\n\r\nChou Yü fled for his life and Kuan Yü pursued. At different points\r\nother captains came out and attacked, so that the men of Wu suffered a\r\ngreat defeat and Chou Yü barely escaped. As he came to the river and\r\nwas going down into his ship the soldiers on the bank jeered at him on\r\naccount of the miscarriage of his scheme for the restoration of\r\ntranquillity. All he had done was to give his enemy a wife and lose his\r\nsoldiers. He was so annoyed that he would have gone up the bank to\r\nfight again, but his captains restrained him. He was very despondent\r\nand felt ashamed to face his master and confess utter defeat and\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nAll at once he cried aloud and fell back in a swoon. His wound had\r\nre-opened. The captains came to his help but it was long before he\r\nrecovered consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Twice had he played his trick\r\n        And twice had he lost the game;\r\n        His heart was full of resentment,\r\n        He was overwhelmed with shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of Chou Yü will appear in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nA BANQUET IN THE BRONZE BIRD PAVILION:\r\nKʻUNG-MING PROVOKES CHOU YÜ A THIRD TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ambuscade into which Chou Yü had fallen had been prepared by the\r\norders of Kʻung-ming and was triple. However, Huang Kai and Han Tang\r\ncontrived to get clear and found refuge in the ships, though with the\r\nloss of many men. When Chou Yü was in safety and looked about him he\r\nsaw Yüan-tê and the Lady Sun quietly resting on a hill top. How could\r\nsuch a sight fail to put him in a rage? And with the access of rage his\r\nwound, not yet healed, burst open once again. He swooned and fell. They\r\nraised him and his ship set sail. He was allowed to depart undisturbed,\r\nwhile Yüan-tê proceeded to Chingchou, where were great rejoicings in\r\nhonour of his recent marriage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chou Yü had gone to Chʻaisang while Chiang Chʻin and those\r\nwith him bore the sad tidings to Sun Chʻüan. He was angry beyond words\r\nand his first thought was to send an army under Chʻêng Pʻu to take\r\nChingchou. Chou Yü also wrote from his sick bed urging his lord to take\r\nvengeance. But Chang Chao knew better and said it could not be done.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “Tsʻao Tsʻao has never forgotten his defeat, but he dares not\r\nattempt to avenge himself while the Sun family are friendly with Liu\r\nPei. If in any moment of anger you two fall upon each other, Tsʻao will\r\ncertainly seize the opportunity and your position will be dangerous.”\r\n\r\nKu Yung supported him, saying, “Beyond all doubt Tsʻao Tsʻao has his\r\nspies here. As soon as he hears of any rift in the friendship between\r\nSun and Liu he will desire to come to an understanding with the latter\r\nand Liu Pei, who fears your power, will accept his offer and take his\r\nside. Such an alliance will be a continual menace to the land south of\r\nthe river. No; the plan for the occasion is to secure the friendship of\r\nLiu Pei by memorialising that he be made Governor of Chingchou. This\r\nwill make Tsʻao Tsʻao afraid to send any army against the south-east.\r\nAt the same time it will raise kindly feelings in the heart of Liu Pei\r\nand win his support. You will be able to find some one who will provoke\r\na quarrel between Tsʻao and Liu and set them at each other and that\r\nwill be your opportunity. In this way you will succeed.”\r\n\r\n“These are good words,” said Sun Chʻüan, “but have I a messenger who\r\ncan accomplish such a mission?”\r\n\r\n“There is such a man, one whom Tsʻao respects and loves.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“What prevents you from employing Hua Hsin? He is ready to hand.”\r\n\r\nWherefore Hua Hsin was given letters and bidden go to the capital,\r\nwhither he proceeded at once and sought to see Tsʻao Tsʻao. They told\r\nhim that Tsʻao and all his friends were at Yehchün, celebrating the\r\ncompletion of the Bronze Bird Pavilion. So thither he went.\r\n\r\nTsʻao had indeed never forgotten his great defeat and nourished schemes\r\nto avenge it, but he feared the combination of his two chief enemies\r\nand that fear restrained him.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the fifteenth year the great Pavilion was completed\r\nand Tsʻao invited a vast assembly to celebrate its inauguration with\r\nbanquets and rejoicings. The pleasaunce was on the bank of the Chang\r\nRiver. The Bronze Bird Terrace stood in the centre, flanked by two\r\nothers named the Terrace of the Jade Dragon and the Terrace of the\r\nGolden Phoenix. Each tower was a hundred feet high and a bridge\r\nconnected them. Gold and jade vied with each other in the many\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nAt the opening ceremony Tsʻao Tsʻao wore a golden headdress inlaid with\r\njewels and a robe of green brocaded silk, girded with a belt of jade.\r\nOn his feet were pearl-encrusted shoes. So clad he took his seat as\r\nhost, while his officers, civil and military, were drawn up below the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\nFor the military officers was arranged an archery competition and one\r\nof his attendants brought forth a robe of red crimson Ssŭchʻuan silk as\r\na prize. This was suspended from one of the drooping branches of a\r\nwillow tree, beneath which was the target. The distance was a hundred\r\npaces. The competitors were divided into two bands, those of his own\r\nfamily being dressed in red and the others in green. They all had\r\ncarved bows and long arrows and were mounted. They stood holding in\r\ntheir steeds till the signal should be given for the games to begin.\r\nEach was to shoot one arrow and the robe was the guerdon for hitting\r\nthe target in the red; misses were to pay a forfeit of drinking a cup\r\nof cold water.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the signal was given a red-robed youth rode quickly forth.\r\nHe was Tsʻao Hsiu. Swiftly he galloped to and fro thrice. Then he\r\nadjusted the notch of his arrow to the string, pulled the bow to its\r\nfull and the arrow flew straight to the bullseye.\r\n\r\nThe clang of the gongs and the roll of the drums announced the feat,\r\nwhich astonished them all. And Tsʻao, as he sat on the terrace, was\r\ndelighted. “A very promising colt of my own,” said he to those about\r\nhim, and he sent a messenger for the red robe that the winner might\r\nreceive it from his own hands.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly from the green side rode out one who cried, “It were more\r\nfitting to let outsiders compete for the Minister’s silken robe; it is\r\nnot right that members of the family monopolise the contest.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao looked at the speaker, who was one Wên Pʻing. And some of\r\nthe officers cried, “Let us see what his shooting is like!”\r\n\r\nSo Wên Pʻing fitted an arrow to the string and fired also from\r\nhorseback while galloping. To the surprise of the onlookers he also\r\nmade a bullseye, which was honoured by another salute from gongs and\r\ndrums.\r\n\r\n“Quickly bring me the robe,” cried Wên Pʻing.\r\n\r\nBut at once from the ranks of the red-robed another competitor dashed\r\nforward, shouting fiercely, “How can you win what has been already won?\r\nBut let me show you how I can shoot an arrow that shall overcome both\r\nyour shots.”\r\n\r\nHe drew his bow to the full and the arrow flew straight to the heart of\r\nthe red. The surprised onlookers saw that this new competitor was Tsʻao\r\nHung, who now became also a claimant for the robe.\r\n\r\nHowever, yet another archer came forth from the green robed ranks,\r\nplaying with his bow and crying, “What is there amazing in your\r\nshooting, you three? See how I can shoot.”\r\n\r\nThis man was Chang Ho. He put his horse to the gallop, then turned his\r\nback and, shooting backwards, also hit the centre of the red.\r\n\r\nThus four arrows were now sticking in the bullseye and all agreed that\r\nit was marvellous archery.\r\n\r\n“I think the robe should be mine,” said Chang Ho.\r\n\r\nBefore he could finish speaking a fifth competitor came out from the\r\nred robes and shouted, “You shot backwards; but that is commonplace\r\nenough. Look while I shoot better than you all.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Hsiahou Yüan. He galloped off to the very limit of the\r\nbutts and then bending his body over backwards he sent his arrow right\r\nin among the other four.\r\n\r\nAs the gongs and drums broke out Yüan put aside his bow and rode up\r\nsaying, “Is not that a better shot than any of its predecessors?”\r\n\r\nThen came out another from the greens who cried, “Leave the robe there\r\nfor me, Hsü Huang, to win.”\r\n\r\n“What can you do that is better than my shot?” said Yüan.\r\n\r\n“That you hit the bullseye is no great feat. You will see me win the\r\nsilken robe after all.”\r\n\r\nSo speaking, Hsü Huang fitted an arrow to his bow. Then looking around\r\nhe aimed at the willow twig from which the robe hung down and shot\r\nthereat so true that his arrow cut it through and the robe fluttered to\r\nthe ground. At once Hsü Huang dashed along, picked up the robe and\r\nslipped it on. Then riding swiftly to the terrace he thanked the\r\nMinister. No one present could withhold unstinted praise and Hsü was\r\nturning to ride away when another green clad captain leaped out saying,\r\n“Where would you go with that robe? Quickly leave it for me!”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned to this man who was Hsü Chʻu. Hsü Huang cried, “The\r\nrobe has already been adjudged to me; would you dare take it by force?”\r\n\r\nHsü Chʻu made no reply but galloped up to snatch the robe. As his horse\r\ndrew near Huang struck at his rival a blow with his bow. But Hsü Chʻu\r\nseized the bow with one hand while with the other he simply lifted his\r\nopponent out of his seat. Wherefore Hsü Huang let go the bow and the\r\nnext moment lay sprawling on the ground. Hsü Chʻu slipped out of the\r\nsaddle too and they began to pommel each other with their fists. Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao sent one to separate them, but in the struggle the robe had been\r\ntorn and soiled. He called the angry rivals before him and they came,\r\none darting fierce looks of hate, the other grinding his teeth with\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the robe; I see only your magnificent courage,” said Tsʻao\r\nsmiling. “What does a robe more or less matter?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he called the captains to him one by one and to each he\r\npresented a robe of Ssŭchʻuan silk. They thanked him for the generous\r\ngifts and he then commanded them to take their seats in due order. Then\r\nto the strains of a band of music, wherein each performer vied with all\r\nthe others, the naval and military officers took their places. Civil\r\nofficers of repute and captains of renown drank one to another, and\r\nhearty felicitations were exchanged.\r\n\r\nTsʻao looked around to those about him saying, “Since the military\r\nofficers have competed in mounted archery for our enjoyment and\r\ndisplayed their boldness and their skill, you, gentlemen scholars,\r\nstuffed full of learning as you are, can surely mount the terrace and\r\npresent some complimentary odes to make the occasion a perfect\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\n“We are most willing to obey your commands,” they replied, all bowing\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nAt that time there was a band of four scholars named, Wang Lang, Chung\r\nYao, Wang Tsʻan and Chʻên Lin, and each of them presented a poem. Every\r\npoem sang the praises of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s valuable services and great\r\nmerits and said he was worthy to receive the highest trust of all.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao had read them he laughed saying, “You gentlemen are\r\nreally too flattering. As a fact I am but an ignoramus who began life\r\nwith a simple bachelor’s degree. And when the troubles began I built me\r\na little cottage in the country near Chʻiaotung, where I could study in\r\nspring and summer and spend the rest of the year in hunting till the\r\nempire was once more tranquil and I could emerge and take office. To my\r\nsurprise I was chosen for a small military office which changed my\r\nintentions and I determined to repress the rebellion and so make a name\r\nfor myself. I thought that I might win an inscription on my tomb to the\r\neffect that it covered the remains of the Marquis Tsʻao, who had\r\nrestored order in the west. That would have been ample for a life’s\r\nwork. I recall now how I destroyed Tung Cho and smote the Yellow\r\nTurbans; then I made away with Yüan Shu and broke the power of Lü Pu;\r\nnext I exterminated Yüan Shao and at the death of Liu Piao I had\r\nsubdued the whole empire. As a Minister of State I have attained the\r\ntopmost pinnacle of honour and I have no more to hope for. Were it not\r\nfor poor me, I know not how many there would be styling themselves\r\nEmperor and dubbing themselves princes. Certain there be who, seeing my\r\ngreat authority, think I have some ulterior aim. But they are quite\r\nwrong. I ever bear in mind what Confucius said of Chou Kung, that he\r\nwas perfectly virtuous, and this saying is ever engraven on my mind. If\r\nI could I would do away with my armies and retire to my fief with my\r\nsimple title of Marquis Wupʻing. Alas! I cannot. I am afraid to lay\r\ndown my military powers lest I should come to harm. Should I be\r\ndefeated, the State would totter and so I may not risk real misfortune\r\nfor the sake of an empty reputation for kindness. There be some of you\r\nwho do not know my heart.”\r\n\r\nAs he closed they all rose and bowed their heads saying, “None are your\r\nequals, O Minister, not even Duke Chou or the great Minister I Yin.”\r\n\r\nA poem has been written referring to this:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Had Duke Chou, the virtuous, died, while foul-mouthed slander was\r\n                                            spreading her vile rumours;\r\n    Or Wang Mang, the treacherous, while he was noted for the deference\r\n                                                   paid to learned men;\r\n    None would have known their real characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this oration Tsʻao Tsʻao drank many cups of wine in quick\r\nsuccession till he became very intoxicated. He bade his servants bring\r\nhim pencil and inkstone that he might compose a poem. But as he was\r\nbeginning to write they told him that the Marquis of Wu had sent Hua\r\nHsin as an envoy and presented a memorial to appoint Liu Pei governor\r\nof Chingchou and that Sun Chʻüan’s sister was now Liu Pei’s wife, while\r\non the river Han the greater part of the nine districts was under Liu\r\nPei’s rule.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was seized with quaking fear at the news and threw the pen\r\non the floor. Chʻêng Yü said to him, “O Minister, you have been among\r\nfighting men by myriads and in danger from stones and arrows many a\r\ntime and never quailed. Now the news that Liu Pei has got possession of\r\na small tract of country throws you into a panic. Why is it thus?”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao replied, “Liu Pei is a dragon among men. All his life\r\nhitherto he has never found his element, but now that he has obtained\r\nChingchou it is as if the dragon, once captive, had escaped to the\r\nmighty deep. There is good reason for me to quake with fear.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the reason of the coming of Hua Hsin?” said Chʻêng.\r\n\r\n“No; I know not,” said the Minister.\r\n\r\n“Liu Pei is Sun Chʻüan’s one terror and he would attack him were it not\r\nfor you, O Minister. He feels you would fall upon him while he was\r\nsmiting his enemy. Wherefore he has taken this means of calming Liu\r\nPei’s suspicions and fears and at the same time directing your enmity\r\ntoward him and from himself.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao nodded; “Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\nChʻêng Yü continued, “Now this is my plan to set Sun and Liu at one\r\nanother and give you the opportunity to destroy both; it can be done\r\neasily.”\r\n\r\n“What is your plan?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“The one prop of Wu is Chou Yü; remove it by memorialising that Chou be\r\nappointed Prefect of Nanchün. Then get Chʻêng Pʻu made Prefect of\r\nChianghsia and cause the Emperor to retain this Hua Hsin in the capital\r\nto await some important post. Chou Yü will assuredly attack Liu Pei and\r\nthat will be our chance. Is not the scheme good?”\r\n\r\n“Friend Chʻêng, you are a man after my own heart.”\r\n\r\nWherefore he summoned the emissary from Wu and overwhelmed him with\r\ngifts. That day was the last of the feastings and merry-makings and\r\nTsʻao, with all the company, returned to the capital where he forthwith\r\npresented a memorial assigning Chou Yü and Chʻêng Pʻu to the posts he\r\nwished, and Hua Hsin was retained at the capital with a post of\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nThe messenger bearing the commissions for their new offices went down\r\nto Wu and both Chou Yü and Chʻêng Pʻu accepted the appointments. Having\r\ntaken over his command the former thought all the more of the revenge\r\nhe contemplated and, to bring matters to a head, he wrote to Sun Chʻüan\r\nasking him to send Lu Su and renew the demand for the rendition of\r\nChingchou.\r\n\r\nWherefore Lu Su was summoned and his master said to him, “You are the\r\nguarantor in the loan of Chingchou to Liu Pei. He still delays to\r\nreturn it and how long am I to wait?”\r\n\r\n“The writing said plainly that the rendition would follow the\r\noccupation of Ssŭchʻuan.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan shouted back, “Yes it said so. But so far they have not\r\nmoved a soldier to the attack. I will not wait till old age has come to\r\nus all.”\r\n\r\n“I will go and enquire?” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\nSo he went down into a ship and sailed to Chingchou.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Liu Pei and Kʻung-ming were at Chingchou gathering in\r\nsupplies from all sides, drilling their men and training their armies.\r\nFrom all quarters men of learning flocked to their side. In the midst\r\nof this they heard of Lu Su’s coming and Liu Pei asked Kʻung-ming what\r\nhe thought of it.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “Just lately Sun Chʻüan concerned himself with\r\ngetting you appointed Governor of Chingchou; that was calculated to\r\ninspire Tsʻao Tsʻao with fear. Tsʻao Tsʻao obtained for Chou Yü the\r\nPrefectship of Nanchün; that was designed to stir up strife between our\r\ntwo houses and set us fighting so that he might accomplish his own\r\nends. This visit of Lu Su means that Chou Yü, having taken over his new\r\ngovernorship, wishes to force us out of this place.”\r\n\r\n“Then how shall we reply?”\r\n\r\n“If he introduce the subject you will at once set up loud lamentations.\r\nWhen the sound of lamentation is at its height I will appear and talk\r\nover your visitor.”\r\n\r\nThus they planned and Lu Su was duly received with all honour. When the\r\nsalutations were over and host and guest were about to be seated, Lu Su\r\nsaid, “Sir, now that you are the husband of a daughter of Wu you have\r\nbecome my lord, and I dare not sit in your presence.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei laughed. “You are an old friend,” said he. “Why this excessive\r\nhumility?”\r\n\r\nSo Lu Su took his seat. And when tea had been served the guest said, “I\r\nhave come at the order of my master to discuss the subject of\r\nChingchou. You, O Imperial Uncle, have had the use of the place for a\r\nlong time. Now that your two houses are allied by marriage, there\r\nshould be the most friendly relations between you and you should hand\r\nit back to my master.”\r\n\r\nAt this Yüan-tê covered his face and began to cry.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked the guest.\r\n\r\nYüan-tê only wept the more bitterly.\r\n\r\nThen Kʻung-ming came in from behind a screen saying, “I have been\r\nlistening. Do you know why my lord weeps so bitterly?”\r\n\r\n“Really I know not.”\r\n\r\n“But it is easy to see. When my lord got the temporary occupation of\r\nChingchou he gave the promise to return it when he had got the west\r\ncountry. But reflect. Liu Chang of Ichou is my lord’s younger brother\r\nand both of them are blood relations of the ruling family. If my lord\r\nwere to move an army to capture another city he fears the blame of the\r\nignorant. And if he yield this place before he has another, where could\r\nhe rest? Yet, while he retains this place it seems to shame you. The\r\nthing is hard on both sides and that is why he weeps so bitterly.”\r\n\r\nThe close of Kʻung-ming’s speech seemed to move Yüan-tê to greater\r\ngrief for he beat his breast and stamped his feet and wept yet more\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nLu Su attempted to console him saying, “Be not so distressed, O Uncle;\r\nlet us hear what Kʻung-ming can propose.”\r\n\r\n“I would beg you to return to your master and tell him all. Tell him of\r\nthis great trouble and entreat him to let us stay here a little\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose he refuse; what then?” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“How can he refuse since he is related by marriage to my master?” said\r\nKʻung-ming. “I shall expect to hear glad tidings through you.”\r\n\r\nLu Su was really the first of generous men and seeing Yüan-tê in such\r\ndistress he could do no other than consent and say he would do so.\r\nYüan-tê and Kʻung-ming both thanked him most cordially and after a\r\nbanquet the emissary went down into his ship to return. On the way he\r\ncalled in to see Chou Yü and told him. But Chou stamped his foot with\r\nrage and said, “My friend, you have been fooled again. Long ago when\r\nLiu Pei was dependent on Liu Piao he always cherished the intention to\r\nsupplant him; think you that he really pities Liu Chang of Shu? This\r\nsort of evasive policy will certainly cause you much trouble. However,\r\nI have a scheme which I think Kʻung-ming will not be able to get the\r\nbetter of. Only you will have to make another journey.”\r\n\r\n“I should be pleased to hear your fine scheme,” said Lu Su.\r\n\r\n“Do not go to see our master. Return to Chingchou and say to Liu Pei\r\nthat since his family and the Suns are related by marriage they really\r\nform but one house, and since he has qualms about attacking the west we\r\nwill do it for him. We will march an army under this pretext, but\r\nreally go to Chingchou, and we shall take him unprepared. The road to\r\nthe west runs through his city and we will call upon him for supplies.\r\nHe will come out to thank the army and we will assassinate him whereby\r\nwe shall revenge ourselves and at the same time remove a source of\r\nfuture evil.”\r\n\r\nThis seemed an excellent plan to Lu Su and he returned at once to\r\nChingchou. Before receiving him Yüan-tê talked over the matter with his\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nSaid Kʻung-ming, “He has not seen the Marquis, he has called in at\r\nChʻaisang and he and Chou Yü have decided upon some scheme, which he is\r\nto talk you into accepting. However, let him talk; only watch me and\r\nwhen I nod my head then agree to whatever he may propose.”\r\n\r\nLu Su was then admitted and said, “The Marquis of Wu praises the noble\r\nvirtue of the Imperial Uncle and after consultation with his officers\r\nbe has determined to take the western kingdom on his behalf and, that\r\ndone, Chingchou can be exchanged for it without further delay. However,\r\nwhen the army marches through it will be expected of you to contribute\r\nsome necessary supplies.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming here nodded his head rapidly, at the same time saying, “We\r\ncould hardly have hoped for such kindness,” while Yüan-tê saluted with\r\njoined hands and said, “This is due to your friendly efforts on our\r\nbehalf.”\r\n\r\n“When the brave army arrives we shall certainly come out to meet it and\r\nentertain the soldiers,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nLu Su felt great satisfaction and was quite happy at his success; he\r\ntook his leave and went homeward. But Yüan-tê as yet did not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n“What is their intention?” said he.\r\n\r\nHis adviser smiled. “Chou Yü’s end is very near. The ruse he is now\r\ntrying would not take in a boy.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“This is the ruse known as ‘borrow a road to exterminate Kuo.’ Under\r\nthe pretence of taking the west they intend to capture this place, and\r\nwhen you go out to compliment the army you will be seized and they will\r\ndash into the city which they hope to find unprepared.”\r\n\r\n“And what are we to do?”\r\n\r\n“Have no anxiety; all we have to do is to prepare a hidden bow to get\r\nthe fierce tiger; to spread the enticing bait to hook the great\r\nleviathan. Wait till Chou Yü comes; if he is not killed he will be\r\nnine-tenths a corpse. We will call in Chao Yün for orders and give him\r\nsecret instructions and I will dispose the others.”\r\n\r\nAnd Yüan-tê was glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Let Chou Yü lay what plans he will,\r\n        Kʻung-ming anticipates his skill;\r\n        That river land fair bait did look,\r\n        But he forgot the hidden hook.\r\n\r\n\r\nLu Su hastened back to Chou Yü to tell him that all was going as he\r\ndesired and Yüan-tê would come out to welcome the army. And Chou Yü\r\nlaughed with glee, saying, “At last! Now they will fall into my trap.”\r\n\r\nHe bade Lu Su prepare a petition for the information of the Marquis and\r\nhe ordered Chʻêng Pʻu to bring up reinforcements. He himself had nearly\r\nrecovered from the arrow wound and felt well. He made his dispositions\r\nfor the advance, telling off the leaders of the van and wings. The army\r\nnumbered five legions and Chou Yü marched with the second division.\r\nWhile voyaging in his ship he was always smiling to think how he was to\r\nhave Kʻung-ming at last.\r\n\r\nAt Hsiakʻou he enquired if there was any one to welcome him. They told\r\nhim the Imperial Uncle had sent Mi Chu to greet him and he was called.\r\n\r\n“What of the preparations for the army?” asked Chou Yü as soon as Mi\r\nChu came.\r\n\r\n“My master has seen to that; all is prepared.” said Mi.\r\n\r\n“Where is the Imperial Uncle?” asked Chou.\r\n\r\n“He is at Chingchou, waiting outside the walls to offer you the cup of\r\ngreeting.”\r\n\r\n“This expedition is on your account,” said Chou Yü. “When one\r\nundertakes so long a march and such a task the rewards for the army\r\nmust be very substantial.”\r\n\r\nHaving got this idea of what Chou Yü expected, Mi Chu returned to his\r\nown city, while the battle ships in close order sailed up the river and\r\ntook their places along the bank. As they went on the most perfect\r\ntranquillity seemed to reign on all sides. Not a ship was visible\r\nanywhere, and no one hindered. Chou Yü pressed forward till he came\r\nquite near Chingchou and still the wide river lay calm. But the spies\r\nwho came back reported two white flags flying on the city walls.\r\n\r\nStill not a man was seen and Chou Yü began to feel suspicious. He had\r\nhis ship navigated in shore and he himself landed on the bank, where he\r\nmounted a horse and, with a small army of veterans under three\r\ncaptains, travelled along the land road.\r\n\r\nBy and bye he came to the city wall. There was no sign of life. Reining\r\nin his steed he bade them challenge the gate. Then some one from the\r\nwall asked who was there. The men of Wu replied that it was their\r\nGeneral in person. Immediately was heard the thud of a club and the\r\nwall became alive with men all armed. And from the tower came out Chao\r\nYün who said, “Why are you here, General?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to take the west for you;” replied Chou Yü, “do you not\r\nknow?”\r\n\r\n“Kʻung-ming knows that you want to try the ruse of ‘borrowing a road to\r\ndestroy Kuo.’ And so he stationed me here. And my master bade me say\r\nthat he and the ruler of the west country are both members of the\r\nreigning family so that he could not think of such baseness as\r\nattacking Shu. If you people of Wu do so, he will be forced to go away\r\ninto the mountains and become a recluse. He could not bear to lose the\r\nconfidence of mankind.”\r\n\r\nAt this Chou Yü turned his horse as if to return. Just then his scouts\r\ncame up to say that armed bands were moving toward him from all sides,\r\nand Kuan Yü and Chang Fei led two of them. Their number was unknown but\r\nthe sound of their tramping shook the heavens. They said they wanted to\r\ncapture Chou Yü.\r\n\r\nAt these tidings Chou Yü’s excitement became so intense that he fell to\r\nthe ground with a great cry, and the old wound re-opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The game was now too deep; in vain he sought\r\n        A countermove; his efforts came to nought.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater chapters will show what was Chou Yü’s fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n“SLEEPING DRAGON” MOURNS AT CHʻAISANG:\r\n“PHOENIX FLEDGELING” INTERVENES AT LEIYANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter it was said that a sudden rage filled the bosom of\r\nChou Yü and he fell to the ground. Then he was carried to his boat. It\r\nonly added to his rage and mortification to be told that his enemies\r\nand rivals could be seen on the top of one of the hills apparently\r\nfeasting and enjoying some music. He lay grinding his teeth with\r\nvexation. “They say I shall never be able to get Ssŭchʻuan! But I will;\r\nI swear I will.”\r\n\r\nSoon after Sun Chʻüan’s brother Yü arrived and Chou Yü told him his\r\nvexations. “My brother sent me to assist you,” said Sun Yü.\r\n\r\nSun Yü ordered the army to press forward and they got to Pachʻiu. There\r\nthey stopped, for the scouts reported large forces under Liu Fêng and\r\nKuan Pʻing barring the river route. This failure did not make the\r\nGeneral any calmer.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a letter from Kʻung-ming arrived, which ran like\r\nthis:—“Since our parting at Chʻaisang I have thought of you often. Now\r\ncomes to me a report that you desire to take The Western Land of\r\nStreams, which I regret to say I consider impossible. The people are\r\nstrong and the country is precipitous and defensible. The governor may\r\nbe weak within, but he is strong enough to defend himself. Now indeed,\r\nGeneral, you would go far and you would render great services, yet can\r\nany one foretell the final result? No; not even Wu Chʻi the great\r\nGeneral could say for certain, nor could Sun Wu be sure of a successful\r\nissue. Tsʻao Tsʻao suffered severe defeat at Chʻihpi; think you he will\r\never cease to hope for revenge? Now if you undertake a long expedition,\r\nwill he not seize the occasion to fall upon Chiangnan and grind it to\r\npowder? Such a deed would be more than I could bear and I venture to\r\nwarn you of the possible danger if haply you may condescend to regard\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe letter made Chou Yü feel very sorrowful and he sighed deeply. He\r\ncalled for paper and a pen and wrote to the Marquis Wu and, having done\r\nthis, he said to his assembled officers, “I have honestly tried to do\r\nmy best for my country but my end is at hand. The number of my days is\r\naccomplished. You must continue to aid our master till his end shall be\r\nachieved——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped; for he had swooned. Slowly he regained consciousness and as\r\nhe looked up to heaven he sighed heavily, “O God, since thou madest me;\r\nwhy didst thou also create Liang?”\r\n\r\nSoon after he passed away; he was only thirty-six.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The battle at Chʻihpi made him famous;\r\n        Though young in years he gained a veteran’s reputation.\r\n        Deep feeling, his music declared its intensity;\r\n        Subtle, with excess hospitality he foiled a plot;\r\n        Persuasive, he once obtained a large gift of grain;\r\n        Capable, he led an army of millions.\r\n        Pachʻiu was his deathbed, there his fate met him.\r\n        Sadly indeed they mourned him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his death his captains sent his dying memorial to the Marquis of\r\nWu, who was most deeply affected and wept aloud at the sad tidings of\r\nhis death. When he opened the letters he saw that Lu Su was named as\r\nthe dead general’s successor. This is the letter:—\r\n\r\n“Possessing but ordinary abilities, there was no reason why I should\r\nhave been the recipient of your confidence and high office, but I have\r\nnot spared myself in the leadership of the great army under my command\r\nthat thereby I might prove my gratitude. Yet none can measure life and\r\nthe number of our days is ordained by fate. Before I could achieve even\r\nmy poor intentions my feeble body has failed me. I regret it without\r\nmeasure. I die with Tsʻao Tsʻao threatening and our northern borders\r\ndisturbed and with Liu Pei in your family as though you were feeding a\r\nfierce tiger. None can foretell the fate of the empire in these weary\r\ndays of stress and of peculiar anxiety for you.\r\n\r\n“Lu Su is most loyal, careful in all matters and a fitting man to\r\nsucceed to my office. When a man is near death his words are wise and\r\nif I may haply retain your regard I may die but I shall not decay.”\r\n\r\n“He should have been a king’s counsellor,” cried Sun Chʻüan, amid his\r\ntears. “He has left me, alas! too soon, and whom have I to lean upon?\r\nBut he recommends his friend and I can do nothing better than take that\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he appointed Lu Su to the vacant command.\r\n\r\nHe also saw that the coffin of his beloved general was sent to\r\nChʻaisang ready for the funeral sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe night of Chou Yü’s death Kʻung-ming was gazing up at the heavens\r\nwhen he saw a bright star fall to the earth. “Chou Yü is dead,” said he\r\nwith a smile. At dawn he sent to tell Yüan-tê, who sent men to find\r\nout, and they came back to say it was true; he had died.\r\n\r\n“Now that this has come to pass what should we do?” said Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“Lu Su will succeed,” said Kʻung-ming. “And I see in the heavens signs\r\nof an assembly of captains in the east so I shall go. The mourning for\r\nChou Yü will serve as a pretext. I may find some able scholar there to\r\nbe of help to you.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid lest the captains of Wu harm you,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“While Chou Yü lived I did not fear; is there anything to dread now\r\nthat he is gone?”\r\n\r\nHowever, he took Chao Yün as commander of his escort when he embarked\r\nfor Pachʻiu, and on the road he heard of Lu Su’s succession to the late\r\ngeneral’s post. As the coffin of Chou Yü had been sent to Chʻaisang,\r\nKʻung-ming continued his journey thither and, on landing, was kindly\r\nreceived by Lu Su. The officers of Wu did not conceal their enmity but\r\nthe sight of the redoubtable Chao Yün, always close at hand, kept them\r\nfrom trying to hurt Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\nThe officers brought by Kʻung-ming were arranged in order before the\r\nbier and he himself poured the libation. Then he knelt and read this\r\nthrenody:—\r\n\r\n“Alas, Kung-chin! Hapless are you in your early death. Length of days\r\nis in the hands of God, yet do men suffer and my heart is deeply\r\ngrieved for you. I pour this libation that your spirit may enjoy its\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\n“I lament you. I lament your younger days passed in the companionship\r\nof Po-fu, when, preferring eternal principles to material wealth, you\r\nabode in a humble cottage.\r\n\r\n“I lament your ripe strength when you guarded distant Pachʻiu, putting\r\nfear into the heart of Liu Piao, destroying rebels and ensuring safety.\r\n\r\n“I lament the grace of your manhood. Married to a fair maid of the\r\nChʻiao family, son-in-law of a minister, you were such as would add\r\nlustre to the Han Court.\r\n\r\n“I lament your resolute purpose when you opposed the pledge-giving. As\r\nin the beginning your wings drooped not, so in the end your pinions\r\nspread wide.\r\n\r\n“I lament your abandon, when your false friend, Chiang, came to you at\r\nPʻoyang. There you manifested your lofty ideals.\r\n\r\n“I lament your magnificent talents, proved in civil administration as\r\nin military science. With fire attacking the fierce enemy you brought\r\nhis strength to weakness.\r\n\r\n“I recall you as you were but yesterday, bold and successful, and I\r\nweep your untimely death. Prostrate I weep tears of sorrow. Loyal and\r\nupright in heart, noble and spiritual by nature, your life has been but\r\nthree decades but your fame will endure for ages.\r\n\r\n“I mourn for your affection. My bowels writhe with sorrow and my\r\ndeep-seated sadness will never cease. The very heavens are darkened.\r\nThe army is sad; your lord sheds tears; your friends weep floods.\r\n\r\n“Scanty of ability am I, yet even of me you begged plans and sought\r\nschemes to aid Wu to repulse Tsʻao, to restore the Hans and comfort the\r\nLius. But with you as the firm corner stone and your perfect\r\ndispositions, could the final result cause any anxiety?\r\n\r\n“Alas, my friend! The quick and the dead are ever separate; they mingle\r\nnever. If in the deep shades spirits have understanding you now read my\r\ninmost heart, yet hereafter there will be none on earth to comprehend.\r\n\r\n“Alas, the pain!\r\n\r\n“Deign to accept this my sacrifice.”\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice finished, Kʻung-ming bowed to the ground and keened while\r\nhis tears gushed forth in floods. He was deeply moved.\r\n\r\nThose who stood on guard by the bier said one to another, “People lied\r\nwhen they said these two were enemies; look at the sincerity shown in\r\nsacrifice.” And Lu Su was particularly affected by the display of\r\nfeeling and thought, “Plainly Kʻung-ming loved him much, but Kung-chin\r\nwas not broadminded enough and would have done him to death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before the Sleeping Dragon emerged from his Nanyang retreat\r\n    Many brilliant men had descended upon this earth;\r\n    Since, O azure Heaven, ye made Kung-ching\r\n    Why needed dusty earth produce a Kʻung-ming?\r\n\r\n\r\nLu Su gave a banquet for Kʻung-ming after which the guest left. Just as\r\nhe was embarking his arm was clutched by a person in Taoist dress who\r\nsaid with a smile, “You exasperated literally to death the man whose\r\nbody lies up there; to come here as a mourner is an open insult to Wu.\r\nIt is as good as to say they have no other left.”\r\n\r\nAt first Kʻung-ming did not recognise the speaker but very soon he saw\r\nit was no other than Pʻan Tung, or the “Phoenix Fledgeling.” Then he\r\nlaughed in his turn, and they two hand in hand went down into the ship,\r\nwhere they talked heart to heart for a long time. Before leaving,\r\nKʻung-ming gave his friend a letter and said, “I do not think that Sun\r\nwill use you as you merit. If you find life here distasteful, then you\r\nmay come to Chingchou and help to support my master. He is liberal and\r\nvirtuous and will not disdain what you have spent your life in\r\nlearning.”\r\n\r\nThen they parted and Kʻung-ming went alone to Chingchou.\r\n\r\nLu Su had the coffin of Chou Yü taken to Wuhu, where Sun Chʻüan\r\nreceived it with sacrifices and lamentations. The dead leader was\r\nburied in his native place.\r\n\r\nHis family consisted of two sons and a daughter, the sons being named\r\nHsün and Yin. Sun Chʻüan treated them with tenderness.\r\n\r\nLu Su was not satisfied that he was the fittest successor to his late\r\nchief and said, “Chou Kung-chin was not right in recommending me, for I\r\nhave not the requisite ability and am unfitted for this post. But I can\r\ncommend to you a certain able man, conversant with all knowledge, and a\r\nmost capable strategist, not inferior to Kuan Chung or Yo I, one whose\r\nplans are as good as those of Sun Wu and Wu Chʻi, the most famous\r\nmasters of the Art of War. Chou Yü often took his advice and Kʻung-ming\r\nbelieves in him. And he is at hand.”\r\n\r\nThis was good news for Sun, who asked the man’s name, and when he heard\r\nit was Pʻang Tung, he replied, “Yes; I know him by reputation; let him\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Pʻang Tʻung was invited to the Palace and introduced. The\r\nformal salutations over, Sun Chʻüan was disappointed with the man’s\r\nappearance, which was indeed extraordinary. He had bushy eyebrows, a\r\nturned-up nose, a dark skin and a stubby beard. So he was prejudiced\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n“What have you studied,” asked he, “and what are you master of?”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung replied, “One must not be narrow and obstinate; one must\r\nchange with circumstances.”\r\n\r\n“How does your learning compare with that of Chou Yü?” asked Sun.\r\n\r\n“My learning is not to be compared with his in the least; mine is far\r\ngreater.”\r\n\r\nNow Sun Chʻüan had always loved his late general and he could not bear\r\nto hear him disparaged. This speech of Pʻang’s only increased his\r\ndislike. So he said, “You may retire, Sir; I will send for you when I\r\ncan employ you.”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung uttered one long sigh and went away. When he had gone Lu Su\r\nsaid, “My lord, why not employ him?”\r\n\r\n“What good would result; he is just one of those mad fellows.”\r\n\r\n“He did good service at the Red Wall fight, however, for it was he who\r\ngot Tsʻao Tsʻao to chain his ships together.”\r\n\r\n“It was simply that Tsʻao wished to chain his ships together. No credit\r\nwas due to this fellow. In any case I give you my word that I will not\r\nemploy him. That much is certain.”\r\n\r\nLu Su went out and explained to Pʻang Tʻung that the failure was not\r\ndue to lack of recommendation, but simply a whim of Sun Chʻüan’s and he\r\nmust put up with it. The disappointed suitor hung his head and sighed\r\nmany times without speaking.\r\n\r\n“I fear you are doomed to constant disappointment here,” said Lu Su.\r\n“There is nothing you can hope for, eh?”\r\n\r\nBut still Pʻang Tʻung was silent.\r\n\r\n“With your wonderful gifts of course you will be successful\r\nwhithersoever you may go. You may take my word for that. But to whom\r\nwill you go?”\r\n\r\n“I think I will join Tsʻao Tsʻao,” said Pʻang Tʻung suddenly.\r\n\r\n“That would be flinging a gleaming pearl into darkness. Rather go to\r\nLiu Pei, who would appreciate you and employ you fittingly.”\r\n\r\n“The truth is that I have been thinking of this for a long time,” said\r\nPʻang Tʻung. “I was only joking just now.”\r\n\r\n“I will give you a letter to Liu Pei, and if you go to him you must try\r\nto maintain peace between him and my lord and get them to act together\r\nagainst Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“That has been the one desire of my life.”\r\n\r\nHe took the letter offered by Lu Su and soon made his way to Chingchou.\r\nHe arrived at a moment that Kʻung-ming was absent on an inspection\r\njourney, but the doorkeeper announced him and said he had come to throw\r\nin his lot with Liu Pei. He was received, for he was no stranger in\r\nname.\r\n\r\nWhen Pʻang Tung was admitted he made the ordinary salutation but did\r\nnot make an obeisance and this, coupled with his ugly face, did not\r\nplease his host.\r\n\r\n“You have come a long and arduous journey,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\nAt this point the suitor should have produced his letters from\r\nKʻung-ming and Lu Su, but did not. Instead he replied, “I hear, O\r\nImperial Uncle, that you are welcoming the wise and receiving scholars,\r\nwherefore I have come to join your service.”\r\n\r\n“The country is decently peaceful now and unfortunately there is no\r\noffice vacant. But away to the northeast there is a small magistracy,\r\nLeiyanghsien, which needs a chief. I can offer you that post until\r\nthere should be something more fitting.”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung thought this rather poor welcome for a man of his talent.\r\nBut his friend was absent, so he could do nothing but control his\r\nannoyance and accept. He took his leave and started.\r\n\r\nBut when he arrived at his post he paid no attention to business at\r\nall; he gave himself up entirely to dissipation. The taxes were not\r\ncollected nor were lawsuits decided. News of this reaching Liu Pei, he\r\nwas angry and said, “Here is this stiff-necked pedant throwing my\r\nadministration into disorder.”\r\n\r\nSo he sent Chang Fei to the district with orders to make a general\r\ninspection of the whole district and look into any irregularities and\r\ndisorders. But as he thought there might be some tact needed Sun Chʻien\r\nwas also sent as coadjutor.\r\n\r\nIn due course the inquisitors arrived at Leiyanghsien, where they were\r\nreceived by the officials and welcomed by the people at the boundary.\r\nBut the magistrate did not appear.\r\n\r\n“Where is the magistrate?” asked Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“Ever since his arrival, a hundred days ago and more, he has attended\r\nto no business, but spends his days from morn to night in wine-bibbing\r\nand is always intoxicated. Just now he is sleeping off a debauch and is\r\nnot yet risen.”\r\n\r\nThis raised Chang Fei’s choler and he would have dismissed the offender\r\nforthwith had not his colleague said, “Pʻang Tʻung is a man of great\r\nability and it would be wrong to deal with him thus summarily. Let us\r\nenquire into it. If he is really so guilty we will punish his offence.”\r\n\r\nSo they went to the magistracy, took their seats in the hall of justice\r\nand summoned the magistrate before them. He came with dress all\r\ndisordered and still under the influence of wine.\r\n\r\n“My brother took you for a decent man,” said Chang Fei, angrily, “and\r\nsent you here as magistrate. How dare you throw the affairs of the\r\ndistrict into disorder?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I have done as you say, General?” said Pʻang Tʻung. “What\r\naffairs have I disordered?”\r\n\r\n“You have been here over a hundred days and spent the whole time in\r\ndissipation. Is not that disorderly?”\r\n\r\n“Where would be the difficulty in dealing with the business of a\r\ntrifling district like this? I pray you, General, to sit down for a\r\nwhile till I have settled the cases.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he bade the clerks bring in all the arrears and he would\r\nsettle them at once. So they brought in the piles of papers and ordered\r\nthe suitors to appear. They came and knelt in the hall while the\r\nmagistrate, pencil in hand, noted this and minuted that, all the while\r\nlistening to the pleadings. Soon all the difficulties and disputes were\r\nadjusted, and never a mistake was made, as the satisfied bows of the\r\npeople proved. By midday the whole of the cases were disposed of and\r\nthe arrears of the hundred days settled and decided. This done the\r\nmagistrate threw aside his pencil and turned to the inquisitors saying,\r\n“Where is the disorder? When I can take on Tsʻao Tsʻao and Sun Chʻüan\r\nas easily as I can read this paper, what attention from me is needed\r\nfor the business of this paltry place?”\r\n\r\nChang Fei was astonished at the man’s ability, rose from his seat and\r\ncrossed over saying, “You are indeed a marvel, Master. I have not\r\ntreated you respectfully enough but now I shall commend you to my\r\nbrother with all my might.”\r\n\r\nThen Pʻang Tʻung drew forth Lu Su’s letter and showed it to Chang Fei.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not show this to my brother when you first saw him?” asked\r\nChang Fei.\r\n\r\n“If I had had a chance I would have done so. But is it likely that one\r\nwould just take advantage of a letter of commendation to make a visit?”\r\n\r\nChang Fei turned to his colleague and said, “You just saved a wise man\r\nfor us.”\r\n\r\nThey left the magistracy and returned to Liu Pei to whom they related\r\nwhat had happened. Liu Pei then seemed to be conscious of his error and\r\nsaid, “I have been wrong; I have behaved unjustly to a sage.”\r\n\r\nChang Fei then gave his brother the letter in which Lu Su had\r\nrecommended Pʻang Tʻung. Opening it he read:—“Pʻang Shih-yüan is not\r\nthe sort of man to be met with in any day’s march. Employ him in some\r\ncapacity where extraordinary talent is required and his powers will\r\ndeclare themselves. Beware of judging him by his looks or you may lose\r\nthe advantage of his abilities and some other will gain him. This would\r\nbe a misfortune.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was feeling cast down at the mistake he had made, as shown by\r\nthe letter, they announced the return of Kʻung-ming. Soon he entered\r\nthe hall and the first question he put after the formal salutations was\r\n“Is Instructor-General Pʻang quite well?”\r\n\r\n“He is in charge of Leiyang,” replied Yüan-tê, “where he is given to\r\nwine and neglects his business.”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming laughed. “My friend Pʻang has extraordinary abilities and\r\nten times my knowledge. I gave him a letter for you, my lord. Did he\r\npresent it?”\r\n\r\n“This very day I have received a letter, but from Lu Su. I have had no\r\nletter written by you.”\r\n\r\n“When a man of transcendent abilities is sent to a paltry post he\r\nalways turns to wine out of simple ennui,” said Kʻung-ming.\r\n\r\n“If it had not been for what my brother said, I should have lost a\r\ngreat man,” said Yüan-tê. Then he lost no time, but sent Chang Fei off\r\nto the north to request Pʻang Tʻung to come to Chingchou. When he\r\narrived Liu Pei went out to meet him and at the foot of the steps asked\r\npardon for his mistake. Then Pʻang Tʻung produced the letter that\r\nKʻung-ming had given him. What Yüan-tê read therein was this:—“As soon\r\nas the “Phoenix Fledgeling” shall arrive he should be given an\r\nimportant post.” Liu Pei rejoiced indeed as he read it, for had not\r\nSsŭma Hui said of the two men, Sleeping Dragon and Phoenix Fledgeling,\r\nthat any man who obtained the help of either of them could restore the\r\nempire when he would? As he now had them both surely the Hans would\r\nrise again.\r\n\r\nThen he appointed Pʻang Tʻung as Chuko Liang’s assistant and gave him\r\ngeneral’s rank, and the two famous strategists began training the army\r\nfor its work of subjugation.\r\n\r\nNews of these doings came to the capital and Tsʻao Tsʻao was told of\r\nLiu Pei’s two strategists and of the army in training and the stores he\r\nwas accumulating and the league between his two chief enemies. And he\r\nknew that he had to expect an attack sooner or later. So he summoned\r\nhis strategists to a council.\r\n\r\nSaid Hsün Yu, “Sun Chʻüan should be first attacked, because of the\r\nrecent death of their ablest general Chou Yü. Liu Pei will follow.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao replied, “If I go on such a distant expedition. Ma Tʻêng\r\nwill fall upon the capital. While I was at Chʻihpi there were sinister\r\nrumours of this and I must guard against it.”\r\n\r\nHsün Yu said, “The best thing that occurs to stupid me is to obtain for\r\nMa the title of ‘Subduer of the South’ and send him against Wu. Thus he\r\ncan be enticed to the capital and got rid of. Then you can have no fear\r\nof marching southward.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao approved and soon Ma Tʻêng was summoned from Hsiliang, in\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nMa Tʻêng, called also Ma Shou-chʻêng, was a descendant of the famous\r\nleader Ma Yüan, styled General, “Queller of the Waves.” His father’s\r\nname was Ma Su. He had held a minor magistracy in the reign of Emperor\r\nHuan, but had lost it and drifted west into Shênsi where he got amongst\r\nthe Chʻiang, one of whose women he took to wife. She bore him a son, Ma\r\nTʻêng. Ma Tʻêng was rather over the common height, and bold-looking. He\r\nwas of a mild disposition and very popular. But in the reign of Emperor\r\nLing these Chʻiangs made trouble and then Ma Tʻêng raised a force and\r\nput it down. For his services he received the title of General,\r\n“Corrector of the West.” He and Han Sui, who was known as “Guardian of\r\nthe West,” were pledged brothers.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the summons to the capital he took his eldest son, Ma\r\nChʻao, into his confidence and told him some of his former life. “When\r\nTung Chʻêng got the Girdle Edict from the Emperor, we formed a society,\r\nof which Liu Pei was one, pledged to put down rebellion. However, we\r\naccomplished nothing, for Tung was put to death and Liu was\r\nunfortunate, while I escaped to the west. However, I hear that Liu Pei\r\nnow holds Chingchou and I am inclined to carry out the plan we made so\r\nlong ago. But here I am summoned by Tsʻao Tsʻao and what is to be\r\ndone?”\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao replied, “Tsʻao Tsʻao has the command of the Emperor to call\r\nyou and if you do not go that will mean disobeying an imperial command\r\nand you will be punished. Obey the summons in so far as to go to the\r\ncapital, where you may be able to arrange to carry out your original\r\nintention.”\r\n\r\nBut his nephew, Ma Tai, held other opinions and opposed this. Said he,\r\n“Tsʻao’s designs are unfathomable and if you go, Uncle, I fear you will\r\nsuffer.”\r\n\r\n“Let me lead the army against the capital,” said Ma Chʻao. “Can we not\r\npurge the empire of evil?”\r\n\r\nBut his father said, “You must take command of the Chʻiang troops for\r\nthe defence of our territory here. I will take with me your two\r\nbrothers and your cousin. When Tsʻao knows that you have the Chʻiang at\r\nyour call and that Han Sui is prepared to assist, he will hardly dare\r\nto work any harm to me.”\r\n\r\n“Father, if you must go be careful not to enter the city till you know\r\nexactly what plots and machinations are afoot.”\r\n\r\n“I will certainly take great care, so do not be too anxious,” said the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe order of march was prepared. The governor took five companies, with\r\nhis two sons as leaders of the van and his nephew bringing up the rear.\r\nThese set out along the tortuous road to the capital. At twenty li\r\ndistance they camped.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao heard of Ma Tʻêng’s arrival he called to him Huang Kʻuei,\r\none of his officers, and said to him, “Ma Tʻêng is to be sent against\r\nthe south and I shall send you as adviser. You are first to go to his\r\ncamp and express my congratulations on his arrival and say that as\r\nHsiliang is so distant and transport very difficult, he is not to take\r\ntoo large an army of his own. I will send a large force. Also tell him\r\nto come in soon for audience of the Emperor. I will send him supplies.”\r\n\r\nWith these instructions Huang Kʻuei went to Ma Tʻêng, who brought out\r\nwine and entertained him well. In his cups the messenger grew\r\nconfidential and said, “My father perished at the hands of Li and Kuo\r\nand I have always nourished resentment. Now there is another rebel in\r\npower wronging our prince.”\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” asked Ma.\r\n\r\n“The wrong doer is that rebel Tsʻao, of course. Do you mean to say you\r\ndo not know?”\r\n\r\nHowever, Ma was careful. He thought it very likely that these words\r\nwere but a trap for him so he pretended to be greatly shocked and\r\nbegged his guest to be careful lest he be overheard.\r\n\r\nBut he cared not. “Then you have quite forgotten the ‘Girdle Edict,’\r\neh?” shouted he.\r\n\r\nMa Tʻêng began to see he was sincere and presently became confidential\r\nin turn and told his guest all his schemes.\r\n\r\n“He wants you to go in to audience; there is no good intention there.\r\nDo not go,” said Huang Kʻuei. “You lead your men up close to the city\r\nand get Tsʻao Tsʻao to come and review them and when he comes,\r\nassassinate him.”\r\n\r\nThey two settled how this plan could be worked out and the messenger,\r\nstill hot with anger and excitement, returned to his home.\r\n\r\nSeeing him so disturbed in mind his wife asked him what was wrong. But\r\nhe would tell her nothing. However, he had a concubine, born of the Li\r\nfamily, called “Fragrance of the Spring.” And it happened that she had\r\nan intrigue with the wife’s younger brother, Miao-tsê, who much desired\r\nto marry her. The concubine who also saw her lord’s displeasure, spoke\r\nof it to her paramour, and he told her she could probably draw from him\r\nwhat was wrong by a leading question. “Ask him what is the truth about\r\ntwo men, Liu Pei and Tsʻao Tsʻao? Who is the wicked one.”\r\n\r\nThat evening Huang Kʻuei went to the apartments of his concubine and\r\nshe presently put the question proposed by her lover. Her lord, still\r\nrather intoxicated, said, “You are only a woman; still you know right\r\nfrom wrong as well as I. My enemy and the man I would slay if I could,\r\nis Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“But why? And if you wish to slay him, why do you not do something?”\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\n“I have done something. I have settled with General Ma to assassinate\r\nTsʻao at the review.”\r\n\r\n“Fragrance of the Spring” of course told her paramour, who told Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao, and he made his arrangements to defeat the scheme. He called up\r\ncertain trusty captains and gave them orders for the morrow and, this\r\ndone, he arrested Huang Kʻuei and all his household.\r\n\r\nNext day, as arranged, Ma and his western men came close up to the wall\r\nand among the flags and banners he discerned that of the Minister\r\nhimself, whereby he knew that he would hold the review in person.\r\n\r\nSo he rode forward. Suddenly a bomb exploded and at this signal there\r\nappeared bodies of armed men right and left and in front, so that the\r\nwestern men were quite hemmed in. Ma Tʻêng then saw the mistake he had\r\nmade and he and his two sons fought valiantly to free themselves from\r\nthe trap. The youngest son soon fell. Father and son rode this way and\r\nthat, seeking a way out, but failed on every side. Both were sorely\r\nwounded and when their steeds fell from their many arrow wounds, both\r\nwere captured.\r\n\r\nMa Tʻêng and his son, and the miserable wretch who could not keep his\r\ncounsel, were brought before Tsʻao. Huang loudly protested his\r\ninnocence. Tsʻao then called in the witness Miao-tsê.\r\n\r\n“That worthless scoundrel has spoiled all my plans!” cried Ma Tʻêng.\r\n“Now I cannot slay the rebel and purge my country. But it is the will\r\nof God.”\r\n\r\nFather and son were dragged forth, the father uttering volleys of abuse\r\nall the time. And so three men came to harm in this adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The son and father share one niche of fame,\r\n        For purest loyalty their praise the same.\r\n        To their own hurt the rebels they withstood,\r\n        Content to die to make their pledges good.\r\n        In blood the solemn oath they did indite\r\n        To slay the wicked and preserve the right.\r\n        A worthy father’s worthy son by western bride.\r\n        Old Fu-po’s name his grandson glorified.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I desire no other reward than the lady, ‘Fragrance of the Spring’ as\r\nwife,” said the betrayer.\r\n\r\nTsʻao smiled and said, “For the sake of a woman then you have brought a\r\nwhole household to death. What advantage would there be in preserving\r\nsuch a miscreant?”\r\n\r\nSo he bade the executioners put both the traitor and the woman to\r\ndeath, with the Huang household. Those who saw the fearful vengeance\r\nsighed at its cruelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Through passion base a loyal man was slain,\r\n        And she who shared his passion shared his fate;\r\n        The man they served was pitiless in hate,\r\n        And thus a mean man’s treachery was vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao did not desire to rouse the rancour of the men of Hsiliang,\r\nwherefore he proclaimed to them, “The intended treachery of your\r\nleaders was theirs alone.” However, he sent to secure the passes so\r\nthat Ma Tai should not escape.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, Ma Tai led the rearguard. Before long the fugitives\r\nfrom the main army came and told him what had occurred at the capital.\r\nThis frightened him so much that he abandoned his army and escaped\r\ndisguised as a trader.\r\n\r\nHaving slain Ma Tʻêng, Tsʻao Tsʻao decided to set out on his expedition\r\nto the south. But then came the disquieting news of the military\r\npreparations of Liu Pei, whose objective was said to be Ssŭchʻuan. This\r\ncaused him alarm, for, as he said, the bird’s wings would be fully\r\ngrown if he obtained possession of the west. He recognised the\r\ndifficulty, but from among his counsellors there arose one who said, “I\r\nknow how to prevent Liu Pei and Sun Chʻüan from helping each other and\r\nboth Chiangnan and Hsichʻuan will be yours.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        Chill death struck down the heroes of the west,\r\n        Calamity approached the bold men of the south.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will unfold the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nAN EXPEDITION FOR REVENGE:\r\nEXPEDIENTS TO CONCEAL IDENTITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is this good plan of yours, friend Chʻên?” asked Tsʻao of the\r\nspeaker, who was a civilian in his service named Chʻên Chʻün.\r\n\r\nChʻên replied, “Your two principal enemies are now firm allies, close\r\nas lips and teeth. But Liu Pei wants Hsichʻuan and if you, O Minister,\r\nsend a mighty host against Sun Chʻüan, he must ask help from his friend\r\nLiu, who, having his heart set on the west, will refuse it. Sun without\r\nthis aid cannot stand and will become so weak that Chiangtung will be\r\nyours for the taking and Chingchou will follow in a tap of the drum.\r\nThe west will follow and the whole Empire is yours.”\r\n\r\n“Those are my thoughts put into words,” replied Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThe expeditionary force of thirty legions set out for the south. Chang\r\nLiao of Hofei was in command of the supply department.\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan speedily heard of the move and called in his advisers. At\r\nthe council Chang Chao said, “Let us send to Lu Su to tell him to write\r\nat once to Liu Pei that he may help us. They are good friends and Liu\r\nwill certainly respond favourably. Beside, since Liu Pei and Sun Chʻüan\r\nare now connected by marriage, there is no risk of refusal. With the\r\nsupport of Liu Pei there is no danger to our country.”\r\n\r\nSun Chʻüan listened to this advice and sent to Lu Su bidding him to ask\r\nhelp from Liu Pei. Accordingly, on receipt of this command, a letter\r\nwas written to Liu Pei, who after reading it, retained the messenger at\r\nthe guest-house till Kʻung-ming could arrive from Nanchün. As soon as\r\nhe arrived Liu Pei showed him the letter. The adviser said, “It is not\r\nnecessary for Chiangnan troops to move, nor need we send ours. I can\r\nprevent Tsʻao Tsʻao from even daring to look in a south-easterly\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\nSo he wrote a reply telling Lu Su he could lay aside all anxiety and\r\nrest content, for should the northern army approach, they would be\r\nforced backward at once.\r\n\r\nThe letter was given to the messenger and then Liu Pei asked his\r\nadviser how he could hope to roll back the huge army that Tsʻao had\r\nprepared to bring south.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “Tsʻao Tsʻao’s chief fear is Hsiliang. Now just lately he\r\nhas slain Ma Tʻêng and his son as well, and the men of Hsiliang are\r\ngrinding their teeth with rage. Now you must write and ask Ma Chʻao to\r\nmarch through the pass and Tsʻao will have no leisure to think of any\r\nexpedition to the south.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was written, sent by a trusty hand and duly delivered.\r\n\r\nNow Ma Chʻao was in Hsiliang. One night he had a vision. In his dream\r\nhe saw himself lying out on a snowy plain and many tigers were coming\r\nup and biting him. He awoke in a fright and began to wonder what the\r\ndream portended. Failing to explain it, he told the dream to his\r\nofficers. One of them ventured to say the portent was evil. This was\r\none, Pʻang Tê, a junior officer.\r\n\r\n“What is your interpretation?” asked Ma Chʻao.\r\n\r\n“Meeting with tigers on a snowy plain is a very inauspicious subject to\r\ndream about. Assuredly our old General is in trouble at the capital.”\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment one came in in hot haste and cast himself on the\r\nearth weeping and crying, “Both your uncle and your brother are dead.”\r\n\r\nIt was Ma Tai and he told the story of the evil that had fallen through\r\nHuang Kʻuei and the plotted assassination that had miscarried and\r\nbecome known. They two had been put to death in the market place and he\r\nhad escaped in disguise.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao fell to the ground and wept bitterly, grinding his teeth with\r\nrage at his enemy Tsʻao. They lifted him to his feet and led him away\r\nto repose.\r\n\r\nSoon after arrived a messenger with a letter from Liu Pei, which read\r\nlike this:—“In these latter days of the hapless Hans, when the\r\nrebellious and tyrannical Tsʻao monopolises all power, to the injury of\r\nthe Emperor and the wretchedness of the people, I, Liu Pei, recall that\r\nI and your father were recipients of an edict and we swore to\r\nexterminate the recreant. Now your father has suffered death at the\r\nhands of the tyrant and you must avenge him. As the holy books say, you\r\ncannot let the same sky cover you nor the same sun shine upon you and\r\nyour father’s murderer. If you can lead your men to attack Tsʻao on one\r\nside I will march my armies to prevent his retreat and he will be taken\r\nand all his evil crew can be exterminated. Then and thus will your\r\nfather be avenged and the Hans can be restored. I might add more but I\r\nwill await your reply.”\r\n\r\nWiping his tears, Ma Chʻao wrote a reply which was returned by the\r\nbearer.\r\n\r\nThe Hsiliang army was then mustered; horse and foot were assembled.\r\nJust before the day that had been fixed for the start the Governor of\r\nthe district, Han Sui, sent for Ma Chʻao, to whom he showed a letter\r\nfrom Tsʻao Tsʻao promising the Marquisate of Hsiliang as a reward for\r\nsending Ma Chʻao a prisoner to the capital.\r\n\r\n“Bind us both, Uncle, and send us thither; you need not move a single\r\nspear,” said the younger man prostrating himself.\r\n\r\nBut Han Sui raised him saying, “Your father and I were sworn brothers;\r\nthink you I would harm you? Rather will I help if you are going to\r\nfight.”\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao expressed his gratitude. The unhappy bearer of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nletter was dragged forth and beheaded. This done the two took count of\r\ntheir armies. Han Sui had eight divisions under as many commanders, all\r\nto be relied upon to follow Han Sui, while the younger man had twenty\r\nlegions counting those under Pʻang Tê and Ma Tai. Such were the forces\r\nwith which they could attack Chʻangan the capital.\r\n\r\nThe commander of that city was Chung Yu. As soon as he heard what was\r\nafoot he sent a fleet messenger to Tsʻao and prepared for defence. He\r\nled his force out into the open plain and arrayed it for battle.\r\n\r\nMa Tai, with a legion and half, came on first, pouring over the\r\ncountryside like a flood. Chung Yu would parley with him, but he came\r\nforward, sword in hand, to attack. However, the defender did not take\r\nthe challenge but turned and fled. Ma Tai followed in pursuit. Soon the\r\nmain body of the invaders arrived and they surrounded the city, which\r\nChung Yu set about defending.\r\n\r\nChʻangan had been the capital of the western Hans and so was well\r\nfortified with a solid wall and a deep moat, safe against the most\r\nterrific attacks. The new armies besieged the city for ten days without\r\nsuccess. Then Pʻang Tê proposed a plan. Said he, “Since the land about\r\nthe city is barren and the water bitter, the people must have\r\ncommunication with the country around in order to live. Further they\r\nhave no fuel. Ten days of siege must have exhausted the supplies in the\r\ncity, wherefore if we relax for a time—well, you will see. We shall\r\ncapture the city without moving a finger.”\r\n\r\n“Your plan seems excellent,” said Ma Chʻao, when he heard what it was.\r\n\r\nThereupon they sent orders to each division to retire and Ma Chʻao\r\ncovered the retreat. Next day Chung Yu went up on the walls to look\r\naround and saw that the besiegers had gone. However, suspecting a ruse,\r\nhe sent out spies, who returned to say the soldiers had really moved\r\naway to a distance. Wherefore he felt much relieved and allowed both\r\nsoldiers and people to go out into the country to cut the much-needed\r\nfirewood and bring in water. The city gates, thrown wide open, were\r\nthronged with those passing in and out.\r\n\r\nThis continued for five days and then they heard that Ma Chʻao’s army\r\nwas returning. A panic ensued. The people rushed into the city and the\r\ngates were once more barred.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the west gate was Chung Chin, brother of Chung Yu. About\r\nthe third watch of the night a torch was seen moving just inside the\r\ngate and when the captain went to see what was wrong, and was passing\r\nthe gateway, a man suddenly galloped up and slashed at him with a\r\nsword. At the same time he shouted “Here is Pʻang Tê!” The captain of\r\nthe gate was taken aback, could not defend himself and was cut down.\r\nThe gate guard was soon disposed of, the gates were shattered and the\r\nsoldiers outside came pouring in. Chung Yu escaped by the opposite gate\r\nand left the city in the hands of his enemies. He reached Chang Pass,\r\nwhere he fortified himself and sent news of the misfortune to Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao threw aside all plans for his expedition to the south when\r\nChʻangan was lost. He at once ordered that the unfortunate Chung Yu at\r\nChang Pass should be replaced by Tsʻao Hung and Hsü Huang, who had a\r\nlegion under their command. They were told to hold the Pass at all\r\ncosts for at least ten days, or they should pay for its loss with their\r\nheads. After ten days the Pass would be no concern of theirs, for Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao would be there with the main army.\r\n\r\nThe two captains made all haste to the Pass and took over the command\r\nfrom Chung Yu. They confined themselves to defence, and though Ma Chʻao\r\nappeared every day and reviled and said shameful things of the three\r\ngenerations of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s family, the guardians of the Pass remained\r\nquiet. But Tsʻao Hung fretted at the daily insults and would have led\r\nthe defenders out to fight had not his colleague restrained him.\r\n\r\n“Ma Chʻao only wishes to provoke you to come out, but remember our\r\norders and go not. The Minister has some master plan.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Hsü Huang. But the advice was hard to follow for Ma Chʻao’s\r\nmen took turns in reviling the defenders of the Pass, resting neither\r\nday nor night. And Hsü Huang found it hard to curb his colleague’s\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nThus it continued till the ninth day. Then the defenders saw that their\r\nenemies had turned all their horses loose and were lolling about on the\r\ngrass and sleeping as if quite fatigued. Thereupon Tsʻao Hung bade them\r\nsaddle his horse, told off three companies and soon this small force\r\nwas dashing down to catch the besiegers unprepared. They at once fled\r\nleaving their steeds and throwing aside their weapons. Tsʻao Hung could\r\nnot resist pursuit and chased them.\r\n\r\nAt this time Hsü Huang was higher up the road taking in cartloads of\r\ngrain and forage; but when he heard what his impulsive colleague had\r\ndone he hastily got some men together and went to his rescue. He\r\nshouted to Tsʻao Hung to return.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great shouting arose near him and out dashed Ma Tai to\r\nattack. Both Tsʻao and Hsü turned to flee, but the drums rolled and two\r\nbodies of men came out from behind the hills. Then a battle began which\r\nwent against them from the first. The Tsʻao men fell fast, but some of\r\nthem thrust through the press and made for the Pass. Their enemies came\r\nin close pursuit and they had to abandon their post and flee whither\r\nthey could find a way.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Hung made all haste to his master to give him the evil tidings.\r\n\r\n“When I gave you the limit of ten days, why did you leave the Pass on\r\nthe ninth?”\r\n\r\n“Those men from Hsiliang hurled every sort of insult at us,” replied\r\nTsʻao Hung, “And when I thought I had them unprepared I took the\r\nopportunity. But I fell victim to their cunning.”\r\n\r\n“You are young and impetuous. But, Hsü Huang, you ought to have known.”\r\n\r\n“He would not listen though I told him many times. And that day I was\r\ntaking in stores in another part of the Pass. As soon as they told me I\r\nfelt sure there would be some misfortune and so I hastened after him,\r\nbut it was too late.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was annoyed and ordered Tsʻao Hung to be put to death. But\r\nhis brother-officers begged that he might be pardoned, and as he had\r\nconfessed his fault, he was allowed to go free and unpunished.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao advanced to Chang Pass and Tsʻao Jên said it would be well\r\nto establish a strong stockade before attacking. So trees were felled\r\nand a strong stockade built. They made three camps and Tsʻao himself\r\nwas in the centre one.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Tsʻao and all his officers in a body rushed to attack the\r\nPass. They ran against the Hsiliang men posted on two sides, halted and\r\nformed their array. This done, Tsʻao rode to the centre standard whence\r\nhe looked at his opponents.\r\n\r\nHe saw before him a body of fine men, every one with the bearing of a\r\nhero. And the leader, Ma Chʻao, was worthy of them, with his pale face\r\nand red lips, his supple hips and broad shoulders, his deep voice and\r\nfierce strength. He was wearing a silver helmet and gripped a long\r\nspear as he sat there on his charger. Pʻang Tê and Ma Tai supported him\r\nand Tsʻao Tsʻao admired him in his secret heart. However, Tsʻao urged\r\nforward his steed and shouted to Ma Chʻao, “Why are you arrayed against\r\nthe Hans, whom your father and grandfather served faithfully?”\r\n\r\nMa ground his teeth and cursed Tsʻao Tsʻao for a rebel, a betrayer of\r\nboth prince and people, the murderer of his father and brother. “My\r\nhate for you is to the death; the same sky shall not continue to cover\r\nus for I will take you captive and satiate my appetite on your living\r\nflesh.”\r\n\r\nWith this he set his spear and rode over toward Tsʻao Tsʻao as if to\r\nslay him. But Yü Chin came out from behind and engaged Ma Chʻao in\r\nbattle. These two fought some half score bouts and then Yü Chin had to\r\nflee. Chang Ho, however, took his place and the two heroes exchanged a\r\nscore of passes. Then Chang Ho, too, ran away.\r\n\r\nNext to come forth was Li Tʻung. Ma Chʻao’s martial prowess was now at\r\nits height and he made short work of Li Tʻung, who went out of the\r\nsaddle at the first blow. Then Ma Chʻao flourished his spear at the men\r\nbehind him as a signal for them to come on, which they did like a\r\nflood. They overwhelmed Tsʻao’s men and Ma Chʻao and his colleague rode\r\nforward to try to capture Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThey came close. Tsʻao heard one of his pursuers shout to another,\r\n“That is he in the red dress!” So he hastily tore off his red robe and\r\nthrew it away. He also heard one say “That is Tsʻao Tsʻao with the long\r\nbeard!” At once Tsʻao took the sword that he wore at his side and sawed\r\noff some of the beard. Yet again a soldier recognised him and told Ma\r\nChʻao that Tsʻao had now cut his beard, whereupon the order went forth\r\nto capture short beards. And then Tsʻao Tsʻao wrapped the corner of a\r\nflag about neck and jowl and fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Panic seized upon the soldiers at Tʻung Pass;\r\n    Frightened, Mêng-tê flung off his brocade robe\r\n    And, terror-stricken, sawed his beard off with a sword.\r\n    The fame of Ma Chʻao rose even to the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nTsʻao had got clear of the battle and was getting calmer. Then again\r\nthe sound of hoofs fell upon his ears and on looking round he perceived\r\nMa Chʻao quite close. He and those near were panic-stricken, and all\r\nscattered for their lives, careless of the fate of their captain.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao, do not flee!” cried Ma coming nearer.\r\n\r\nThe whip dropped from Tsʻao Tsʻao’s nerveless hand as he saw his enemy\r\ncoming closer and closer. But just as Ma had levelled his spear for a\r\nthrust Tsʻao slipped behind a tree, changed the direction of his flight\r\nand so escaped, while Ma struck the tree. He quickly pulled out his\r\nspear but the delay gave the fugitive an advantage although it did not\r\nquite free him from pursuit, for Ma Chʻao was soon again galloping on\r\nhis track. As they drew near the slope of some hills a bold captain\r\nsuddenly appeared, who cried, “Do not hurt my lord!”\r\n\r\nThis was Tsʻao Hung and he went toward Ma Chʻao, whirling his sword. Ma\r\nChʻao was stopped and this saved Tsʻao Tsʻao’s life. Tsʻao Hung and Ma\r\nChʻao fought half a hundred bouts till both began to grow weary and\r\nbecome uncertain of their strokes. And when, shortly after, Hsiahou\r\nYüan appeared with a half score of horse, Ma Chʻao found it prudent to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao was escorted to his camp. Although he had lost Tsʻao\r\nJên yet the camps were still unharmed and the losses had not been\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nAs he sat in his tent Tsʻao said, “Had I not spared Tsʻao Hung I should\r\nhave fallen at the hands of Ma Chʻao to-day.” So he called in his\r\nrescuer and rewarded him well. And they got together the scattered men\r\nand strengthened the camp, deepening the moat and raising the rampart.\r\nMa Chʻao came daily and challenged any one to combat and abused them\r\nall shamefully, but, by the order of the General these insults were\r\ntreated with silent contempt.\r\n\r\n“Our enemies use long spears,” said the officers. “We will meet them\r\nwith bows and crossbows.”\r\n\r\n“They may have long spears,” replied Tsʻao Tsʻao, “but whether I give\r\nbattle or not depends on my decision. How can they thrust at us if we\r\ndo not go out? All you have to do is to take no notice of them and they\r\nwill speedily retire.”\r\n\r\nThe officers wondered. They said one to another, “The Minister came out\r\non this expedition of his own will and was foremost in the fight; why\r\ndoes he accept defeat so easily?”\r\n\r\nAfter some days the spies reported that Ma Chʻao had been reinforced by\r\nthe Chʻiang, the tribesmen beyond the frontier. Tsʻao Tsʻao took the\r\nnews gleefully. His officers asked him why the news pleased him and\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao replied, “Wait till I have defeated them and I will\r\nexplain.”\r\n\r\nThree days later there was a report of further reinforcements and Tsʻao\r\nnot only smiled but gave a banquet. His officers ridiculed him in\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nThen said Tsʻao Tsʻao, “You gentlemen laugh because I cannot destroy Ma\r\nChʻao. Well then, can any one of you propose a plan?”\r\n\r\nThen rose Hsü Huang and said, “O Minister, you have a large force here\r\nand the enemy are strongly posted beyond the Pass. This means that on\r\nthe west side of the river they are unprepared. If you can get an army\r\nsecretly across the river and block the ferry you will cut off their\r\nretreat, and if you can smite them on the north side of the river they\r\ncan get no reinforcements and must fail.”\r\n\r\n“What you propose is just what I think,” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nSo Hsü Huang was placed over four companies and with Chu Ling marched\r\nto the west of the river and hid in the gullies. They were to wait till\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao crossed the river to the north so that both could strike\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThen Tsʻao Tsʻao ordered Tsʻao Hung to prepare boats and rafts at the\r\nferry. Tsʻao Jên was left in command of the camps. Tsʻao Tsʻao himself\r\ncrossed the River Wei, and when Ma Chʻao heard of the new military\r\nmovements he said, “I understand. The Pass is left, rafts are being\r\nprepared; that means that he is going to cross to the north side and\r\ncut off my retreat. I must coast along the river and keep him off. If I\r\ncan do that his food will run short within twenty days and that will\r\ncause a mutiny. I will travel along the south bank and attack.”\r\n\r\nHan Sui did not approve this plan. He quoted the military maxim to\r\nstrike when troops were half over the river. “Attack from the south\r\nbank when his army is in the act of crossing and his men will be\r\ndrowned in the river,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Uncle, your words are good,” replied Ma Chʻao. And the spies went\r\nforth to find out the time of crossing the river.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao Tsʻao’s preparations were complete and all was ready he sent\r\nthree parties of soldiers over the river first. They reached the ferry\r\nat the first sign of dawn and the veterans were sent over first and lay\r\nout a camp. Tsʻao and his guard took up station on the south bank to\r\nwatch the crossing.\r\n\r\nVery soon the sentinels reported the approach of a General dressed all\r\nin white, whom everyone knew must be Ma Chʻao. This terrified them and\r\nthey made a rush to get into the boats. The river bank became a scene\r\nof shouting men struggling who could first embark. Tsʻao Tsʻao sat\r\nwatching and never stirred. He only issued orders to stop the\r\nconfusion. Meanwhile the yelling of the men and the neighing of the\r\nhorses of the approaching army came nearer and nearer. Suddenly a\r\ncaptain jumped out of one of the boats and shouted to Tsʻao. “The\r\nrebels are close! Get into a boat, O Minister.”\r\n\r\n“The rebels are near; why not?” replied Tsʻao simply to the speaker,\r\nwho was Hsü Chʻu. And he turned round to look at them.\r\n\r\nAs a fact Ma Chʻao was very close, not a hundred paces away, and Hsü\r\nChʻu laid hold of Tsʻao and dragged him down the bank. The boat had\r\nalready pushed off and was ten feet from the bank but Hsü Chʻu took\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao on his back and leaped on board. The boat was small and in\r\ndanger of being overturned, wherefore Hsü Chʻu drew his sword and\r\nchopped away at the hands clinging to the side so that the men fell\r\nback into the water.\r\n\r\nThe boat went down stream, Hsü Chʻu standing in the prow poling as hard\r\nas he could. His master crouched out of sight at his feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Ma Chʻao saw the boat in mid-stream drifting down with the current\r\nhe took his bow and arrows and began to shoot. He also ordered his\r\nbrave captains to go along the river and shoot so that a shower of\r\narrows fell about the boat. Hsü Chʻu fearing Tsʻao Tsʻao would be\r\nwounded, protected him with a saddle which he held over him with his\r\nleft hand, for Ma Chʻao’s shooting was not in vain. Many of the men\r\nworking the boat were wounded. Some had fallen overboard, while more\r\nlay in the bottom of the boat. The boat itself got out of control and\r\nwas whirled hither and thither by the current. Hsü Chʻu straddled over\r\nthe tiller and tried thus to guide the boat while he poled with one\r\nhand and with the other held the protecting saddle over Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThen the Magistrate of Weinan, Ting Pʻei, who from a hill top saw that\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was very closely pressed, nay, even in danger of his life,\r\ndrove out from his camp all the cattle and horses there, so that they\r\nscattered over the hillside. This was too much for the born herdsmen of\r\nthe plains. At sight of the beasts, they left the river and ran off to\r\nsecure them. Nor had they any inclination to pursue their enemy.\r\n\r\nAnd so Tsʻao Tsʻao escaped. As soon as they reached the northern shore\r\nthe boat was scuttled. The rumour had spread that Tsʻao Tsʻao was on\r\nthe river and in danger, so all his officers came to his aid. But he\r\nwas now safe on shore. Hsü Chʻu’s double armour was stuck full of\r\narrows. His officers escorted Tsʻao Tsʻao to the camp where they made\r\ntheir obeisance and expressed the hope that he had not suffered\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“The rebels very nearly caught me to-day,” said he smiling.\r\n\r\n“They would have got across the river had they not been enticed away by\r\nthe freeing of the cattle and horses,” said Hsü Chʻu.\r\n\r\n“Who was it that drew them off?” said Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nSome one who knew told him. Before long the Magistrate Ting came in to\r\npay his respects and Tsʻao Tsʻao thanked him.\r\n\r\n“I should have been a prisoner but for your happy thought,” said he.\r\nAnd the Magistrate received a rank in the army.\r\n\r\n“Though they have gone, yet they will assuredly return to-morrow,” said\r\nTing Pʻei. “You must prepare to repel them.”\r\n\r\n“My preparations are all made,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao ordered his captains to spread themselves along the river\r\nbank and throw up mounds as shelters for camps. If they saw the enemy\r\napproaching the soldiers were to be withdrawn from behind the mounds,\r\nleaving the ensigns all flying, so as to give the impression that each\r\ncamp contained a garrison. Along the river they were to dig ditches and\r\nput up sheds, thus to entice the enemy there and their men would\r\nstumble into the pits and fall easy victims.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao returned to Han Sui and told him how he had nearly captured\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao, but a certain bold captain had taken Tsʻao on his back and\r\nleaped with him into a boat.\r\n\r\nHan Sui replied, “I have heard that Tsʻao Tsʻao had a body guard of the\r\nbravest and strongest soldiers under the command of Tien Wei and Hsü\r\nChʻu. They are called the Tiger Guards. Now as Tien Wei is dead, the\r\nman you saw must have been Hsü Chʻu. He is both brave and powerful and\r\ngoes by the name of Tiger-lust. You will do well to avoid him.”\r\n\r\n“I know his name, too,” said Ma.\r\n\r\n“Tsʻao Tsʻao now means to attack our rear,” continued Han Sui; “let us\r\nattack first, before he can establish camps and stockades. If once he\r\ncan do that it will be difficult to dislodge him.”\r\n\r\n“My idea is that we should hold the north bank and prevent him from\r\ncrossing.”\r\n\r\n“Worthy nephew, keep guard here while I go along the bank of the river\r\nand fight Tsʻao Tsʻao.”\r\n\r\n“If you will take Pʻang Tê as your van-leader, I am content,” said Ma\r\nChʻao.\r\n\r\nSo Han Sui and Pʻang Tê, with five legions, went away down to the\r\nriver, while Tsʻao again warned his captains to entice the enemy. Pʻang\r\nTê was in advance with a goodly squadron of iron-clad horsemen and they\r\nburst along at full speed Then there arose a confused shouting as they\r\nall went plunging into the ditches prepared for them. Pʻang Tê soon\r\nleaped out, gained the level ground and laid about him with all his\r\nmight. He slew many men and presently got out of the thick of the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nBut Han Sui had also been involved and Pʻang went afoot to try to aid\r\nhim. On the way he met Tsʻao Jung, whom he cut down. Then mounting the\r\ndead man’s steed he rode forward fiercely, slaying as he passed. He\r\nreached his leader whom he led away south-east. The men of Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\npursued him, but Ma Chʻao came with reinforcements and drove them off.\r\nHe rescued a great number and they continued fighting till evening when\r\nthey withdrew and mustered their men. Some officers were missing and a\r\ncouple of hundred men had been killed when they fell into the pits.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao and Han Sui discussed what should next be done. “If we give\r\nthe enemy time, he will make himself strong on the north bank. I think\r\nwe can do no better than to raid his camp to-night.”\r\n\r\n“We must have a force and supports for it,” said Han Sui.\r\n\r\nSo it was decided that Ma Chʻao should lead the striking force with\r\nPʻang Tê and Ma Tai as supports. They would start at nightfall.\r\n\r\nNow Tsʻao’s men were on the north bank of the Wei and he gave his\r\ncaptains orders, saying, “The rebels will try to surprise us as they\r\nare deceived by my not having set up stockades. You will place your men\r\nin ambush.”\r\n\r\nAt nightfall Ma Chʻao sent out a small scouting party, which seeing\r\nnothing, penetrated deep into the enemy’s lines. Presently the signal\r\nwas given. Out leapt the hidden men and in a few moments the whole\r\nscouting party were killed. And close at hand came the main army.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Wait for the foe all undismayed,\r\n        Place your men in ambuscade.\r\n        Captains striving to outvie\r\n        Are not beaten easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho got the advantage will presently be told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nHSU CHʻÜ STRIPS FOR A FIGHT WITH MA CHʻAO:\r\nTSʻAO TSʻAO WRITES A LETTER TO SOW DISSENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fight narrated in the last chapter lasted till morn when each side\r\ndrew off, Ma Chʻao camping on the Wei River, whence he kept up\r\nharassing attacks both day and night. Tsʻao Tsʻao, also camped in the\r\nbed of the same river, began to construct three floating bridges out of\r\nhis rafts and boats so as to facilitate communication with the south\r\nbank. Tsʻao Jên established a camp on the river, which he barricaded\r\nwith his carts and waggons.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao determined to destroy this camp, so his men collected straw\r\nand each man marched with a bundle and took fire with him. Han Sui’s\r\nmen were to fight. While one party attacked, the other party piled up\r\nthe straw, which they lit, and soon there was a fierce fire all around.\r\nThe defenders could do nothing against it so they abandoned the camp\r\nand ran away. All the transport and bridges were destroyed. It was a\r\ngreat victory for the Hsiliang army and gave them the command of the\r\nRiver Wei.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was sad at the failure to make good his strong camp and\r\nfearful of his defencelessness. Then Hsün Yu proposed a mud wall. So\r\nthree legions were set to build a mud rampart. The enemy seeing this\r\nharassed the workmen with perpetual attacks at different points so that\r\nthe work went slowly. Beside the soil was very sandy and the wall would\r\nnot stand but collapsed as fast as it was built. Tsʻao Tsʻao felt\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\nIt was the ninth month and the fierce cold of winter was just coming\r\non. Ominous clouds covered the sky day after day with never a break.\r\nOne day as Tsʻao Tsʻao sat in his tent, very disheartened, a stranger\r\nwas announced and was led in. He was an old man who said he had a\r\nsuggestion to offer. He was tall, sparely built and spiritual looking.\r\nHe gave his name as Lou Tzŭ-po and said he came from Ching-chao. He was\r\na recluse and a Taoist, his religious name being Mêng-mei or\r\n“Plum-blossom Dreamer.” Tsʻao Tsʻao received him with great courtesy\r\nand presently the venerable one began, “O Minister, you have long been\r\nstriving to make a camp on the river. Now is your opportunity; why not\r\nbegin?”\r\n\r\n“The soil is too sandy to stand,” said Tsʻao. “But if you have some\r\nother plan to propose, pray tell me what it is, O hermit.”\r\n\r\n“You are more than human, O Minister, in the art of war, and you surely\r\nknow the times and seasons. It has been overcast for many days and\r\nthese clouds foretell a north wind and intense cold. When the wind\r\nbegins to blow you should hurry your men to carry up the earth and\r\nsprinkle it with water. By dawn your wall will be complete.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao seized upon the suggestion. He offered his aged visitor a\r\nreward but he would receive nothing.\r\n\r\nThat night the wind came down in full force. Every man possible was set\r\nto earth-carrying and wetting. As they had no other means of carrying\r\nwater they made stuff bags which they filled with water and let out the\r\nwater over the earth. And so as they piled the earth they froze it\r\nsolid with water, and by dawn the wall was finished and stood firm.\r\n\r\nWhen his scouts told Ma Chʻao that the enemy had built a wall, and he\r\nhad ridden out and seen it, he was greatly perplexed and began to\r\nsuspect help from the gods.\r\n\r\nHowever, very soon after he got his whole army together and sounded an\r\nattack. Tsʻao Tsʻao himself rode out of the camp, with only the\r\nredoubtable Hsü Chʻu in attendance, and advanced toward the enemy.\r\nFlourishing his whip he called out, “I, Mêng-tê, am here alone and I\r\nbeg Ma Chʻao to come out to parley with me.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Ma Chʻao rode out, his spear set ready to thrust.\r\n\r\n“You despised me because I had no wall to my camp but lo! in one single\r\nnight, God has made me a wall. Do you not think it time to give in?”\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao was so enraged that he almost rushed at Tsʻao Tsʻao, but he\r\nwas not too angry to notice the henchman behind him, glaring in angry\r\nfashion, who held a gleaming sword in his grip. He thought this man\r\ncould be no other than Hsü Chʻu, so he determined to find out. With a\r\nflourish of his whip he said, “Where is the noble ‘Tiger Marquis’ that\r\nI hear you have in your camp?”\r\n\r\nAt this Hsü lifted his sword and roared, “I am Hsü Chʻu of Chʻiaochün!”\r\nFrom his eyes shot gleams of supernatural light and his attitude was so\r\nterror-striking that Ma dared not move. He turned his steed and\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao and his doughty follower returned to their camp and as they\r\ntwo passed between the armies not a man there but felt a quiver of\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“They know our friend Hsü Chʻu over there as Marquis Tiger,” said Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao when he returned.\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter the soldiers all called him by that name.\r\n\r\n“I will capture that fellow Ma to-morrow,” said Hsü.\r\n\r\n“Ma Chʻao is very bold,” said his master. “Be careful.”\r\n\r\n“I swear to fight him to the death,” said Hsü.\r\n\r\nThen he sent a written challenge to his enemy saying that the “Tiger\r\nMarquis” challenged Ma Chʻao to a decisive duel on the morrow.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao was very angry when he received the letter. “Dare he insult me\r\nso?” cried he. Then he wrote his pledge to slay Tiger-lust on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nNext day both armies moved out and arrayed in order of battle. Ma Chʻao\r\ngave Pʻang Tê and Ma Tai command of the two wings, while Han Sui took\r\nthe centre. Ma Chʻao took up his station in front of the centre and\r\ncalled to Tiger-lust to come out. Tsʻao Tsʻao, who was on horseback by\r\nthe standard, turned and said, “He is no less bold than Lü Pu.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Hsü Chʻu rode forth whirling his sword and the duel began.\r\nThey fought over a hundred bouts and neither had the advantage. But\r\nthen, their steeds being spent with galloping to and fro, each retired\r\nwithin his own lines and obtained a fresh mount. The contest was\r\nrenewed and a hundred more encounters took place, still without victory\r\nto either.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hsü Chʻu galloped back to his own side, stripped off his\r\narmour, showing his magnificent muscles and, naked as he was, leaped\r\nagain into the saddle and rode out to continue the battle.\r\n\r\nAgain the champions engaged, while both armies stood aghast. Thirty\r\nbouts more, and Hsü, summoning up all his force, plunged toward Ma with\r\nhis sword held high to strike. But Ma avoided the stroke and rode in\r\nwith his spear pointing directly at his opponent’s heart. Throwing down\r\nhis sword, Hsü dashed aside the spear, which passed underneath his arm.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a struggle for the spear and Hsü by a mighty effort snapped\r\nthe shaft so that each held one half. Then the duel was continued, each\r\nbelabouring the other with the pieces of the broken spear.\r\n\r\nAt this point Tsʻao Tsʻao began to fear for his champion and so ordered\r\ntwo of his captains to go out and take a hand. At this Pʻang Tê and Ma\r\nTai gave the signal to their armoured horsemen to attack. They rode in\r\nand a mêlée began in which Tsʻao’s men were worsted and the great\r\nchampion Hsü Chʻu received two arrow wounds in the shoulder. So the men\r\nof Tsʻao retreated to their stockade, Ma Chʻao following them to the\r\nriver. Tsʻao’s men lost more than half their number.\r\n\r\nTsʻao barred his gates and allowed none to go out. Ma Chʻao went down\r\nto the river. When he saw Han Sui he said, “I have seen some wicked\r\nfighters, but none to match that man. He is aptly nicknamed\r\nTiger-lust.”\r\n\r\nThinking that by strategy he might get the better of Ma Chʻao, Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao secretly sent two bodies of men across the river to take up\r\nposition so that he might attack in front and rear.\r\n\r\nOne day from his ramparts, Tsʻao Tsʻao saw Ma Chʻao and a few horsemen\r\nride close up to the walls and then gallop to and fro like the wind.\r\nAfter gazing at them for a long time he tore off his helmet and dashed\r\nit on the ground saying, “If that Ma is not killed may I never be\r\nburied!”\r\n\r\nHsiahou Yüan heard him and his heart burned within him. He cried, “May\r\nI die here at once if I do not destroy that rebel!”\r\n\r\nWithout more ado he flung open the gates and rode out with his company.\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao tried to stop this mad rush, but it was no good, so,\r\nfearing he might come to grief, he rode out after him. At sight of the\r\nmen of Tsʻao, Ma Chʻao faced his men about extended them in line and,\r\nas the enemy approached, dashed forward to the attack. Then noticing\r\nTsʻao himself among them he left Hsiahou and rode straight for Tsʻao.\r\nPanic seized Tsʻao and he rode for his life, while his men were thrown\r\ninto confusion.\r\n\r\nIt was during the pursuit of this portion of the Tsʻao army that Ma\r\nChʻao was told of the force on the other bank of the river. Realising\r\nthe danger he abandoned the pursuit, called in his men and went to his\r\nown camp, there to consult with Han Sui.\r\n\r\n“What now? Tsʻao has crossed the river and we can be attacked in the\r\nrear,” said Ma.\r\n\r\nA certain Li Kʻan said, “Then you had better come to an agreement;\r\nsacrifice some territory and make peace. Then both can repose through\r\nthe winter and await the changes and chances that may come with the\r\nspring warmth.”\r\n\r\n“He is wise,” said Han Sui, “and I advise the same.”\r\n\r\nBut Ma Chʻao hesitated. Others exhorted him to make peace and at length\r\nhe agreed. So Yang Chʻiu and Hou Hsüan were sent as messengers of peace\r\nto the camp of Tsʻao Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“You may return; I will send my reply,” said Tsʻao when they had\r\ndeclared the purport of their mission. And they left.\r\n\r\nThen Chia Yu said to Tsʻao Tsʻao, “What is your opinion, O Minister?”\r\n\r\n“What is yours?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“War allows deceit, therefore pretend to agree. Then we can try some\r\nmeans of sowing suspicions between Han and Ma so that we may thereby\r\ndestroy both.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao clapped his hands for very joy. “That is the best idea of all!\r\nMost suitable! You and I agree in our ideas; I was just thinking of\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nSo an answer was returned saying, “Let me gradually withdraw my\r\nsoldiers and I will give back the land belonging to you on the west of\r\nthe river.” And at the same time Tsʻao ordered the construction of a\r\nfloating bridge to help in the withdrawal.\r\n\r\nWhen the reply arrived, Ma Chʻao said to Han Sui, “Although he agrees\r\nto peace, yet he is evil and crafty. We must remain prepared against\r\nhis machinations. Uncle, you and I will take turns in watching Tsʻao\r\nand Hsü Huang on alternate days. So shall we be safe against his\r\ntreachery.”\r\n\r\nThey agreed and began the regular alternate watch. Soon Tsʻao got to\r\nknow what they were doing and he turned to Chia Hsü saying, “I am\r\nsucceeding.”\r\n\r\n“Who keeps the look-out on this side to-morrow?” asked Tsʻao.\r\n\r\n“Han Sui.”\r\n\r\nNext day Tsʻao at the head of a large party of his captains rode out of\r\nthe camp and the officers presently spread out right and left, he\r\nhimself remaining a solitary rider visible in the centre. Han Sui did\r\nnot know that Tsʻao had come out. Presently Tsʻao called out, “Do any\r\nof you soldiers want to see Tsʻao Tsʻao? Here I am quite alone. I have\r\nnot four eyes nor a couple of mouths, but I am very knowing.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers turned pale with fright. Then Tsʻao called up a man and\r\ntold him to go and see Han Sui and say “Sir, the Minister humbly asks\r\nyou to come and confer with him.” Thereupon Han went out, and seeing\r\nTsʻao wore no armour, Han also threw off his and rode out clad in a\r\nlight robe. Each rode up to the other till their horse’s heads nearly\r\ntouched and there they stood talking.\r\n\r\nSaid Tsʻao, “Your father and I took our degrees at the same time and I\r\nused to treat him as an uncle. You and I set out on our careers at the\r\nsame time, too, and yet we have not met for years. How old may you be\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“I am forty six,” replied Han.\r\n\r\n“In those old days in the capital we were both very young and never\r\nthought about middle age. If we could only restore tranquillity to the\r\nState, that would be a matter of rejoicing.”\r\n\r\nAfter that they chatted long about old times, but neither said a word\r\non military matters. They gossiped for a couple of hours before they\r\ntook leave of each other.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before some one told Ma Chʻao of this meeting and he\r\nwent over to his ally to ask about it.\r\n\r\n“What was it Tsʻao Tsʻao came out to discuss to-day?” said he.\r\n\r\n“He just recalled the old days when we were together in the capital.”\r\n\r\n“Did he say nothing about military matters?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word; and I could not talk about them alone.”\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao went out without a word but he felt suspicious.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsʻao returned to his camp he said to Chia Hsü, “Do you know why I\r\ntalked with him thus publicly?”\r\n\r\n“It may be an excellent idea,” said Hsü, “but it is not sufficient\r\nsimply to estrange two people. I can improve on it and we will make\r\nthem quarrel and even kill each other.”\r\n\r\n“What is your scheme?”\r\n\r\n“Ma Chʻao is brave but not very astute. You write a letter with your\r\nown hand to Han himself and put in it some rambling statements about\r\nsome harm that is going to happen. Then blot it out and write something\r\nelse. Afterwards you will send it to Han, taking care that Ma shall\r\nknow all about it. He will demand to read the letter, and when he sees\r\nthat the important part of the letter has been changed, he will think\r\nthat Han Sui has made the changes lest his secrets should leak out.\r\nThis will fit into the private talk you had with Han the other day and\r\nthe suspicion will grow until it has brought about trouble. I can also\r\nsecretly corrupt some of his subordinates and get them to widen the\r\nbreach and we can settle Ma Chʻao.”\r\n\r\n“The scheme looks excellent,” said Tsʻao, and he wrote the letter as\r\nsuggested, and then erased and changed it, after which he sealed it\r\nsecurely and sent it across to Han Sui.\r\n\r\nSurely enough some one told Ma Chʻao about the letter, which increased\r\nhis doubts, and he came to Han Sui’s quarters to ask to see it. Han\r\ngave it to him and the erasures and alterations struck Ma at once.\r\n\r\n“Why are all these alterations here?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“It came like that; I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Does any one send a rough draft like this? It seems to me, Uncle, that\r\nyou are afraid I shall know something or other too well and so you have\r\nchanged the wording.”\r\n\r\n“It must be that Tsʻao has sealed up the rough draft by mistake.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so. He is a careful man and would not make such a\r\nmistake. You and I, Uncle, have been allies in trying to slay the\r\nrebel; why are you turning against me now?”\r\n\r\n“If you doubt my word I will tell you what you can do. To-morrow, in\r\nfull view of the army, I will get Tsʻao Tsʻao to come out and talk. You\r\ncan hide in behind the ranks ready to kill me if I am false.”\r\n\r\n“That being so I shall know that you are true, Uncle.”\r\n\r\nThis arrangement made, next day Han Sui with five captains in his\r\ntrain, rode to the front while Ma Chʻao concealed himself behind the\r\ngreat standard. Han Sui sent over to say that he wished to speak to the\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nThereupon at his command, Tsʻao Hung, with a train of ten horsemen rode\r\nout, advanced straight to Han Sui, leaned over to him and said, loudly\r\nenough to be heard plainly, “Last night the Minister quite understood\r\nthere is no mistake.” Then without another word on either side he rode\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao had heard. He gripped his spear and started galloping out to\r\nslay his companion in arms. But the five captains checked him and\r\nbegged him to go back to camp. When Han Sui saw him, he said, “Nephew,\r\ntrust me, really I have no evil intentions.”\r\n\r\nBut think you that Ma Chʻao did? Burning with rage he went away. While\r\nHan Sui talked over the matter with his five captains.\r\n\r\n“How can this be cleared up?”\r\n\r\n“Ma Chʻao trusts too much to his strength,” said Yang Chʻiu, one of\r\nthem. “He is always inclined to despise you, Sir. If we overcome Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao do you think he will give way to you? I think you should rather\r\ntake care of your own interests, go over to the Minister’s side and you\r\nwill surely get rank one day.”\r\n\r\n“I was his father’s pledged brother and could not bear to desert him,”\r\nsaid Han Sui.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that as things have come to this pass you simply have\r\nto now.”\r\n\r\n“Who would act as go-between?” asked Han.\r\n\r\n“I will,” said Yang Chʻiu.\r\n\r\nThen Han Sui wrote a private letter which he confided to Yang Chʻiu,\r\nwho soon found his way over to the other camp. Tsʻao Tsʻao was only too\r\npleased, and he promised that Han Sui should be made Marquis of\r\nHsiliang and Yang Chʻiu its Prefect. The other confederates should be\r\nrewarded in other ways. When the preparations for the act of treachery\r\nwere complete a bonfire was to be lighted in Han’s camp and all would\r\ntry to do away with Ma Chʻao.\r\n\r\nYang Chʻiu went back and related all this to his chief and Han Sui felt\r\nelated at the success of his overtures. A lot of wood was collected in\r\ncamp at the back of his tent ready for the signal blaze and the five\r\ncaptains got ready for the foul deed. It was decided that Ma Chʻao\r\nshould be persuaded into coming to a banquet and there they would slay\r\nhim then.\r\n\r\nAll this was done, but not without some hesitation and delay, and some\r\nnews of the plot reached Ma Chʻao. He found out the careful\r\npreparations that had been made and resolved to act first. Leaving Ma\r\nTai and Pʻang Tê in reserve, he chose a few trusted men and with\r\nstealthy steps made his way into Han Sui’s tent. There he found Han Sui\r\nand his five confederates deep in conversation. He just caught a word\r\nor two that Yang Chʻiu said, “We must not delay, now is the time.”\r\n\r\nIn burst Ma Chʻao raging and yelling, “You herd of rebels! Would you\r\ndare to plot against me?”\r\n\r\nThey were taken aback. Ma Chʻao sprang at Han Sui and slashed at his\r\nface. Sui put up his hand to ward off the blow and it was cut off. The\r\nfive drew their swords and set on Ma Chʻao and his men who rushed\r\noutside, followed by the five who slashed away, but were kept at bay by\r\nMa Chʻao’s wonderful swordsmanship. And as the swords flashed, the red\r\nblood flowed. Soon one of the five was down and a second disabled; then\r\nthe other three fled.\r\n\r\nMa Chʻao ran back into the tent to finish Han Sui but the servants had\r\nremoved him. Then a torch was lit, and soon there was commotion all\r\nthrough the camp. Ma Chʻao mounted his horse, for Pʻang Tê and Ma Tai\r\nhad now arrived, and the real fight began. Tsʻao’s men poured in from\r\nall sides and the Hsiliang men fought with each other.\r\n\r\nLosing sight of his companions, Ma Chʻao and a few of his men got to\r\nthe head of the floating bridge over the Wei just about dawn. There he\r\nfell across Li Kʻan coming over the bridge. Ma Chʻao set his spear and\r\nrode at him full tilt. Li Kʻan let go his spear and fled. Lucky for him\r\nit seemed at first that Yü Chin came up in pursuit. But unable to get\r\nnear enough to seize Ma Chʻao, Yü Chin sent an arrow flying after him.\r\nMa Chʻao’s ear caught the twang of the bowstring and he dodged the\r\narrow, which flew on and killed Li Kʻan. Ma Chʻao turned to attack his\r\npursuer, who galloped away, and then he returned and took possession of\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nQuickly Tsʻao’s men gathered about him and the fiercest among them, the\r\nTiger Guards, shot arrows at Ma Chʻao, which he warded off with his\r\nspear shaft so that they fell harmless to the earth. Ma Chʻao and his\r\nmen rode to and fro striking a blow wherever there was a chance, but\r\nthe enemy were very thick about him and he could not force his way out.\r\nIn desperation he made a dash northwards and got through, but quite\r\nalone. Of his followers every one fell.\r\n\r\nStill he kept on dashing this way and that till he was brought down by\r\na crossbow bolt. He lay upon the ground and his enemies were pressing\r\nin. But at the critical moment a troop came in from the north-west and\r\nrescued him. Pʻang Tê and Ma Tai had come up in the very nick of time.\r\n\r\nThus Ma Chʻao was rescued and they set him on one of the soldiers’\r\nhorses and he again took up the battle. Leaving a trail of blood in his\r\nrear he got away north-west.\r\n\r\nHearing that his enemy had got away, Tsʻao Tsʻao ordered his captains\r\nto pursue him day and night and offered rewards for him dead or alive.\r\nFor his head the reward was a thousand taels and the marquisate of a\r\nfief of a myriad families. If any one captured Ma the reward was the\r\nrank of general. Consequently the pursuit was warm as every one was\r\nanxious to win renown and reward. Meanwhile careless of all but flight\r\nMa galloped on and one by one his followers dropped by the way. The\r\nfootmen who were unable to keep up were captured till very few remained\r\nand only some score of riders were left. They travelled toward Shênsi.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao in person joined the pursuit and got to Anting, but there\r\nMa Chʻao was still far in advance so he gave up and returned. Gradually\r\nthe captains did the same, all coming back to Chʻangan. Poor Han Sui,\r\nwith the loss of his left hand, was an invalid, but he was rewarded\r\nwith the marquisate and his confederates, the five captains, were given\r\nrank and office.\r\n\r\nThen orders were given to lead the whole army back to the capital. Yang\r\nFou, a military officer of rank, came to Chʻangan to point out the\r\ndanger of withdrawal. “Ma Chʻao has the boldness of Lü Pu and the heart\r\nof a barbarian. Unless you destroy him this time he will come again and\r\nhe will be both bolder and stronger, and the whole of this district\r\nwill be lost to the Throne. Wherefore you should not withdraw your\r\narmy.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao said, “I would be quite willing to finish the subjugation but\r\nthere is much to do in the capital and the south is still to conquer.\r\nSo I cannot remain. But you, Sir, might secure this country for me. Do\r\nyou consent?”\r\n\r\nYang Fou did consent. And he brought to Tsʻao Tsʻao’s notice Wei Kʻang,\r\nwho was made Governor, with joint military powers. Just before Yang Fou\r\nleft he said to Tsʻao Tsʻao, “A strong force ought to be left in\r\nChʻangan, as a reserve in case they be required.”\r\n\r\n“That has been already dealt with,” replied Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nContentedly enough Yang Fou took leave and went away.\r\n\r\nHis captains asked Tsʻao to explain his recent policy, since the first\r\nout-break at Tʻung Pass and he replied, “The rebel first held the Pass.\r\nHad I forthwith taken the east the rebels would have defended the camps\r\none by one and mustered at all the ferries, and I should never have got\r\nacross the river. So I massed men against Tʻung Pass and made the\r\nrebels guard the south so that the west was left open. Thus Hsü Huang\r\nand Chu Ling could cross over and I was able later to cross over to the\r\nnorth. Then I made the raised road and the mud rampart to deceive the\r\nenemy and cause them to think I was weak and thus embolden them up to\r\nthe point of attacking without proper preparation. Then I used the\r\nclever device of causing dissension in their ranks and was able in one\r\nday to destroy the stored up energy of all their forces. It was a\r\nthunder clap before you could cover your ears. Yes indeed; the\r\nmutations of the art of war can be called infinite.”\r\n\r\n“But one thing more puzzled us,” said the officers, “and we ask you to\r\nexplain it. When you heard the enemy was reinforced you seemed to grow\r\nhappier. Why was that?”\r\n\r\n“Because the Pass was distant and if the rebels had taken advantage of\r\nall defensible points and held them, they could not have been quelled\r\nin less than a couple of years. When they came on altogether they made\r\na multitude but they were not unanimous. They easily quarrelled and,\r\ndisunited, were easily overcome. So I had reason to rejoice that they\r\ncame on altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed no one can equal you in strategy,” said his officers, bowing\r\nlow before him.\r\n\r\n“Still, remember that I rely on you,” said Tsʻao.\r\n\r\nThen he issued substantial rewards to the army and appointed Hsiahou\r\nYüan to the command at Chʻangan. The soldiers who had surrendered were\r\ndistributed among the various troops. Hsiahou Yüan recommended Fêng I,\r\nand one, Chang Chi, of Kaoling, as his aids.\r\n\r\nSo the army returned to the capital where it was welcomed by the\r\nEmperor in his State chariot. As a reward for his service Tsʻao Tsʻao\r\nwas given the court privileges of omitting his distinctive name when he\r\nwas received in audience and of proceeding toward the daïs without\r\nassuming the appearance of frantic haste. Further he might go to court\r\narmed and booted, as did the Han Minister, Hsiao Ho, of old. Whence his\r\nprestige and importance waxed mightily.\r\n\r\nThe fame of these doings penetrated west into Hanchung, and one of the\r\nfirst to be moved to indignation was Chang Lu, Prefect of Hanning. This\r\nChang Lu was a grandson of Chang Ling who retired to Mount Humin, in\r\nSsŭchʻuan, where he had composed a work on Taoism for the purpose of\r\ndeluding the multitude.\r\n\r\nYet all the people respected him, and when he died his son, Chang Hêng,\r\ncarried on his work, and taught the same doctrines. Disciples had to\r\npay a fee in rice, five measures. The people of his day called him the\r\nRice Thief.\r\n\r\nChang Lu, his son, styled himself Master Superior and his disciples\r\nwere called commonly devil soldiers. A headman was called Libationer\r\nand those who made many converts were called Chief Libationers. Perfect\r\nsincerity was the ruling tenet of the cult and no deceit was permitted.\r\nWhen any one fell ill an altar was set up and the invalid was taken\r\ninto the Room of Silence where he could reflect upon his sins and\r\nconfess openly. Then he was prayed for. The director of prayers was\r\ncalled Superintending Libationer.\r\n\r\nWhen praying for a person they wrote his name on a slip and his\r\nconfession and made three copies thereof, called “The writing of the\r\nThree Officers.” One copy was burned on the mountain top as a means of\r\ninforming Heaven; another was burned to inform Earth; and the third was\r\nsunk in water to tell the Controller of the Waters. If the sick person\r\nrecovered he paid as fee five measures of rice.\r\n\r\nThey had Public Houses of Charity wherein the poor found rice and flesh\r\nand means of cooking. Any wayfarer was allowed to take of these\r\naccording to the measure of his appetite. Those who took in excess\r\nwould invite punishment from on high. Offences were pardoned thrice;\r\nafterwards offenders were punished. They had no officials but all were\r\nsubject to the control of the Libationers.\r\n\r\nThis sort of cult had been spreading in Hanchung for some thirty years\r\nand had escaped repression so far because of the remoteness of the\r\ndistrict. All the Government did was to give Chang a title and take\r\nmeans to secure from him a full quota of tribute.\r\n\r\nWhen the reports of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s success against the west, and his\r\nprestige and influence, reached the Hanchung people they met to\r\nconsult, for they feared lest, Tʻêng and Ma being overcome, they would\r\nbe next invaded. This Chang proposed to the assembly that he should\r\nassume the title of Prince of Hanning and superintend the defence.\r\n\r\nIn reply one Yen Pu said, “The families of this province are reckoned\r\nby myriads and there are ample supplies of everything. This place is a\r\nnatural stronghold. Now Ma Chʻao’s soldiers are newly defeated. The\r\nfugitives from the Tzŭwu Valley are very numerous. My advice is that as\r\nLiu Chang of Ichou is weak we should take possession of Hsichʻuan and\r\nthen you may style yourself Prince as soon as you like.”\r\n\r\nThis speech greatly pleased Chang Lu, who then began to concert\r\nmeasures with his brother to raise an army.\r\n\r\nStories of the movement reached Hsichʻuan. It is necessary here to say\r\na few words about the west. The governor was Liu Chang, a son of Liu\r\nYen, a descendant from a Prince of the Imperial House. The Prince had\r\nbeen moved out to Chingling some generations ago and the family had\r\nsettled there. Later, Liu Yen became an official and when he died in\r\ndue course, his son was recommended for the vacant Prefectship of\r\nIchou. There was enmity between the Prefect and the Changs because some\r\nof the latter’s relatives had been put to death.\r\n\r\nWhen he knew of the danger, Liu Chang despatched one Pʻang Hsi as\r\nPrefect of Pahsi to ward off Chang Lu. But Liu Chang had always been\r\nfeeble, and when he received news from his lieutenant of Chang Lu’s\r\nmovements his heart sank within him for fear and he hastily called in\r\nhis advisers.\r\n\r\nAt the council one haughtily said, “My Master, be not alarmed, I am no\r\ngenius but I have a bit of a healthy tongue and with that I will make\r\nChang Lu afraid even to look this way.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        When plots did grow about the west,\r\n        It suited Chingchou’s plans the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speaker’s name and lineage will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nCHANG SUNG TURNS THE TABLES ON YANG HSIU:\r\nOCCUPATION OF SHU DISCUSSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who proposed the plan spoken of in the last chapter was Chang\r\nSung, who belonged to Ichou and held the small office of pieh-chia, or\r\nSupernumerary Charioteer. His appearance was grotesque. He had a broad\r\nforehead, protuberant at the temples like a countryman’s hoe, and a\r\npointed head. His nose was flat and his teeth protruded. He was a dwarf\r\nin stature but had a deep voice like a great bell.\r\n\r\n“What proposal have you to offer that may avert this danger?”\r\n\r\n“My proposal is that we gain the support of Tsʻao Tsʻao. As we know, he\r\nhas made a clean sweep of the Empire. Lü Pu went first and both the\r\nYüans followed, all exterminated. Lately he has destroyed Ma Chʻao. In\r\nshort he is the one man against whom no one can stand. Therefore, my\r\nlord, prepare me worthy gifts to take to the capital and I will get\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao to march an army against Hanchung, which will keep this\r\nChang Lu occupied so that we shall be left alone.”\r\n\r\nThis met Liu Chang’s views and so he prepared gold and pearls and rich\r\nstuffs, worthy presents for the man of power. And when these were ready\r\nhe appointed Chang Sung his emissary. Chang Sung in the meantime\r\noccupied his leisure in secretly copying maps and plans of the west\r\ncountry. When all was ready he started with a small escort.\r\n\r\nThey heard this in Chingchou and Kʻung-ming sent a trusty person to the\r\ncapital to keep him informed as to all the doings.\r\n\r\nChang Sung arrived in Hsütu, and, after he had established himself in\r\nhis lodging, he made daily visits to the Minister’s Palace to try to\r\nobtain an interview. But his last success had filled Tsʻao Tsʻao with\r\ninsufferable pride and he did nothing but give banquets. He never\r\nappeared except for the most important affairs, and even carried on the\r\nbusiness of the state in his own residence. So Chang Sung waited many\r\ndays. But when he got to know the persons who were nearest the\r\nMinister, he bribed them and obtained an audience.\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao was seated in the high place, and after his visitor had\r\nfinished his salutations, he said, “Your Master Liu Chang has sent no\r\ntribute for several years; why?”\r\n\r\n“Because the roads are dangerous and thieves and robbers infest them.\r\nIntercourse is restricted.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao interrupted in a loud harsh voice, “What thieves and robbers are\r\nthere when I have cleansed the country?”\r\n\r\n“How can you say the land is tranquil when one sees Sun Chʻüan in the\r\nsouth, Chang Lu in the north, Liu Pei in the west and every one of\r\nthese with armies reckoned in legions? The weakest of them has half a\r\nscore.”\r\n\r\nThe mean appearance of the emissary had prejudiced Tsʻao Tsʻao from the\r\noutset, and when he heard these blunt words he suddenly shook out his\r\nsleeves, rose and left the hall. Those in attendance were annoyed with\r\nChang Sung and said, “How can you behave so rudely when you come on a\r\nmission? Your whole attitude was blunt and discourteous. Happily for\r\nyou our lord remembered you had come from afar and did not take open\r\nnotice of your fault. The best thing for you is to go home again as\r\nquickly as you can.”\r\n\r\nBut Chang Sung smiled. “We have no plausible flatterers and glib\r\ntalkers in our western country,” said he.\r\n\r\nAt this, one from below the steps called out, “So you call us plausible\r\nand glib then; and you have none such in your country, eh?”\r\n\r\nChang Sung looked around and saw the speaker was a man with thin\r\ndelicate eyebrows crossing narrow eyes set in a pale spiritual face. He\r\nasked his name. It was Yang Hsiu, a son of Yang Piao. The young man was\r\nthen employed in the commissariat of the Minister. He was deeply read\r\nand had the reputation of being a clever controversialist, as Chang\r\nSung knew. So on one side was a desire to confound and on the other\r\noverweening pride in his own ability, with contempt for other scholars.\r\nPerceiving the ridicule in Chang Sung’s speech Yang Hsiu invited him to\r\ngo to the library where they could talk more freely. There, after they\r\nhad got settled in their respective places, Yang Hsiu began to talk\r\nabout the west country.\r\n\r\n“Your roads are precipitous and wearisome,” said Yang.\r\n\r\n“But at our lord’s command we travel, even through fire and water; we\r\nnever decline,” replied Chang.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a country is this Shu?”\r\n\r\n“Shu is a name for the group of districts known of old as Ichou. The\r\nroads are intersected by streams and the land bristles with steep\r\nmountains. The circuit is over two hundred marches and the area thirty\r\nthousand square li. The population is dense, villages being so close\r\nthat the crowing of cocks in one waken the people in the next, and the\r\ndogs barking in this excite the curs in that. The soil is rich and well\r\ncultivated and droughts or famines are equally unknown. Prosperity is\r\ngeneral and the music of pipes and strings can always be heard. The\r\nproduce of the fields is piled mountain high. There is no place its\r\nequal.”\r\n\r\n“But what of the people?”\r\n\r\n“Our administrators are talented as Hsiang-ju (Ssŭma Hsiang-ju): our\r\nsoldiers able as Fu-po (Ma Yüan): our physicians are expert as\r\nChung-ching; our diviners are profound as Chün-pʻing (Yen Tsun). Our\r\nschools of philosophy and our culture stand forth as models and we have\r\nmore remarkable men than I can enumerate. How should I ever finish the\r\ntale of them?”\r\n\r\n“And how many such as you, Sir, do you think there are at the orders of\r\nyour Governor?”\r\n\r\n“Our officers are all geniuses; wise, bold, loyal, righteous and\r\nmagnanimous. As for poor simpletons like me, they are counted by\r\nhundreds; there are cartloads of them; bushels of them. No one could\r\ncount them.”\r\n\r\n“What office may you hold then?”\r\n\r\nChang Sung replied, “Mine can hardly be called an office. I am a\r\nSupernumerary Charioteer. But, Sir, what State affairs may you\r\ncontrol?”\r\n\r\n“I am an Accountant in the Palace of the Minister,” replied Yang.\r\n\r\n“They say that members of your family held office for many generations\r\nand I do not understand why you are not in court service actually\r\nassisting the Emperor, instead of filling the post of a mere clerk in a\r\nprivate Palace.”\r\n\r\nYang Hsiu’s face suffused with shame at this rebuke, but he mastered\r\nhimself and replied, “Though I am among the minor officials, yet my\r\nduties are of great importance and I am gaining experience under the\r\nPrime Minister’s guidance. I hold the office for the sake of the\r\ntraining.”\r\n\r\nChang Sung smiled, “If what I have heard is true, Tsʻao Tsʻao’s\r\nlearning throws no gleaming light on the way of Confucius or Mencius,\r\nnor does his military skill illumine the art of Sun or Wu. He seems to\r\nunderstand the doctrine of brute force and holding on to what\r\nadvantages he can seize, but I see not how he can give you any valuable\r\ntraining or enlighten your understanding.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Sir; that comes of dwelling in out-of-the-way parts. How could you\r\nknow of the magnificent talents of the great Minister? But I will show\r\nyou something.”\r\n\r\nHe called up an attendant and bade him bring a book from a certain\r\ncase. He showed this to his guest, who read the title “The New Book of\r\nMêng-tê.” Then he opened it and read it through from the beginning, the\r\nwhole thirteen chapters. They all dealt with the art of war.\r\n\r\n“What do you take this to be?” asked Chang Sung, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n“This is the great Minister’s discussion of the art of ancient and\r\nmodern war composed on the model of Sun’s treatise. You may be\r\ndisdainful of the Minister’s talents but will this not go down to\r\nposterity?”\r\n\r\n“This book! Every child in Shu knows this by heart. What do you mean by\r\ncalling it a new book? It was written by some obscure person of the\r\ntime of the Warring States (Chou Dynasty, about 320 B.C.) and Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao has plagiarised it. But he has deceived no one but you, Sir.”\r\n\r\n“But what is the use of your sarcastic insult in saying that your\r\nschool children know the book by rote? It has never been given to the\r\nworld although copies have been made. It belongs to his private\r\nlibrary.”\r\n\r\n“Do you disbelieve me? Why, I know it and could repeat it.”\r\n\r\nThen he repeated the whole book, word for word, from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n“You remember it like this after only one reading! Really you are\r\nmarvellous.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        He boasted not a handsome face,\r\n        Nor was his body blessed with grace.\r\n        His words streamed like a waterfall,\r\n        He read a book and knew it all.\r\n        Shu’s glories could he well rehearse,\r\n        His lore embraced the universe.\r\n        Or text or note of scholiast\r\n        Once read, his memory held fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt leave-taking Yang Hsiu said, “Remain a while in your lodgings till I\r\ncan petition our Minister to give you another interview.”\r\n\r\nChang Sung thanked him and left. By and bye Yang Hsiu went to see Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao on the matter of receiving the emissary from the west and said,\r\n“Sir, why did you formerly treat Chang Sung so off-hand.”\r\n\r\n“He spoke very rudely; that is why.”\r\n\r\n“But you bore with Mi Hêng; why not with this man?”\r\n\r\n“Mi Hêng’s reputation for scholarship stood highest of all and I could\r\nnot bear to put him to death. But what ability has this Chang?”\r\n\r\n“To say nothing about his speech being like the River of Heaven,\r\nnothing daunts his talent for dialectic. I happened to show him your\r\nnew treatise; he read it over once and could repeat it. From this it is\r\nevident he is cultured and has a prodigious memory. There are few like\r\nhim in the world. But he said the book was the work of an obscure\r\nperson of a few hundred years back and every school boy in his country\r\nknew it.”\r\n\r\n“It only shows that the ancients and I are in secret sympathy,” replied\r\nTsʻao.\r\n\r\nHowever, he ordered the book to be torn up and burned.\r\n\r\n“Then may I bring him to see you, Sir, that he may see the glory of our\r\ncourt.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao grudgingly consented, saying, “I am reviewing troops\r\nto-morrow on the western parade-ground. You may bring him there and let\r\nhim see what my army looks like. He will be able to talk about it when\r\nhe goes home. When I have dealt with the south I shall take the west in\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\nHence the very next day Yang Hsiu took Chang Sung over to the west\r\nparade ground, where a review of the Tiger Guard was to be held. There\r\nwere five legions of them, and when drawn up in order, they made a very\r\nbrave show with their gleaming helmets and bright new uniforms. Their\r\ndrums rolled to shake the heavens and their weapons glittered in the\r\nsun. Their discipline and order were perfect; their gay banners\r\nfluttered in the breeze. They looked ready to fly even, so alert and\r\nsmart were they.\r\n\r\nChang Sung glanced at them contemptuously. After a long time Tsʻao\r\nTsʻao called up Chang Sung and, pointing to his army, said, “Have you\r\never seen such fine bold fellows in your country?”\r\n\r\n“We never see this military parade in Shu; we govern men by\r\nrighteousness.”\r\n\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao changed colour and looked hard at the bold speaker, who\r\ngazed back at him without the least sign of fear. Yang Hsiu shot a\r\nquick glance at him, but Tsʻao went on, “I regard the rat-class of the\r\nworld [There is a pun here; the characters for “rat” and “Shu” are read\r\nthe same] as of no more importance than so many weeds, and for my army\r\nto reach a place is to overcome it, to give battle is to conquer, to\r\nbesiege is to take. Those who are with me, live; but those who oppose\r\nme, die. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“O Minister, I know well that when you march out your army you always\r\nconquer. I knew it when you attacked Lü Pu at Pʻuyang; and when you\r\nfought Chang Hsiu at Wanchʻêng; and when you met Chou Yü at the Red\r\nWall; and when Hua Yung encountered Kuan Yü; and on that day when you\r\ncut off your beard and threw away your robe at the Pass; and when you\r\nhid in a boat to escape the arrows on the Wei River. On all these\r\noccasions no one could stand against you.”\r\n\r\nIt made Tsʻao Tsʻao very angry to be thus twitted with his misfortunes\r\nand he said, “You stuck-up pedant! How dare you thus bring up all my\r\nfailures?”\r\n\r\nHe called to his attendants to eject the bold disputant and put him to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nYang Hsiu ventured to argue with him saying, “You may behead him, but\r\nhe came from Shu bearing tribute and his death would have a very evil\r\neffect on all distant peoples.”\r\n\r\nBut Tsʻao Tsʻao was too angry to be reasonable and persisted. However,\r\nHsün Yü also remonstrated and Chang Sung was not put to death. But he\r\nwas beaten and ejected. He returned to his lodging and left the city\r\nthat night, reflecting upon what he had intended and what he had\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThought he, “I did not expect such arrogance when I came with the\r\nintention of giving him a province. When I get back Liu Chang will\r\nexpect great things. Now I am returning empty handed and a failure to\r\nendure the laughter of my fellow countrymen. I will not go back. I have\r\nheard of the virtues of Liu Pei and I will go to him and see what\r\nmanner of man he is. Then I can decide what to do.”\r\n\r\nSo with his little escort and following he made for Chingchou. He had\r\nreached the boundaries of Yingchou (Wuchʻang) when he met a troop of\r\nhorsemen, at the head of whom rode a captain in simple undress, who\r\npulled up, saying, “Surely you are the Charioteer Chang.”\r\n\r\n“I am he,” said Chang Sung.\r\n\r\nThe captain quickly dismounted and humbly said, “I have expected you\r\nthese many days. I am Chao Yün.”\r\n\r\nChang Sung dismounted and returned the salutation saying, “Then you are\r\nno other than Chao Tzŭ-lung, of Chʻangshan.”\r\n\r\n“No other,” was the reply. “And my lord Liu Yüan-tê bade me await you\r\nhere and offer you refreshment after your long and toilsome journey.”\r\n\r\nAt this some soldiers brought forward wine and food which they offered\r\nkneeling.\r\n\r\nChang Sung said, “I am come because the world says Liu Pei is liberal\r\nand kindly disposed.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few cups of wine the two retook the road toward Chingchou,\r\nwhich they neared next day at evening. They went to the guest-house.\r\nHere they found a large number of men who received the visitor with the\r\nbeating of drums and every sign of respect. And the officer in command,\r\nbowing low, said, “My brother sent me to meet you after your long and\r\ndusty journey and prepare the guest house for your reception. My name\r\nis Kuan.”\r\n\r\nSo Chang Sung and Chao Yün dismounted and entered the rest-house, where\r\nhosts and guest exchanged formal salutations and took their seats. In a\r\nshort time refreshments were served and both men were most diligent in\r\ntheir attention to the traveller. This roadside banquet was prolonged\r\nto the time of setting the watch, when they prepared for rest.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after the early meal, they mounted and continued their\r\njourney. Very soon they met Yüan-tê himself, with an escort, and his\r\ntwo chief advisers, deferentially standing by the roadside.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he recognised them, Chang Sung dismounted and walked toward\r\nthem. Yüan-tê received him with extreme respect.\r\n\r\n“Your exalted name has been long known to me,” said Yüan-tê, “it has\r\nreverberated through my ears. My one regret is that cloudy hills and\r\nlong distances have hitherto prevented me from enjoying the advantage\r\nof your instruction. Hearing that you were passing through, I have come\r\nto meet you and if you would be willing to notice me and condescend to\r\nrest for a time in my desolate city, thus allowing me to satisfy my\r\nlong disappointed desire to see you, I should indeed hold myself\r\nfortunate.”\r\n\r\nNaturally the traveller’s vanity was tickled and he joyfully remounted.\r\nThey rode bridle to bridle into the city. When they reached the\r\nresidence again they exchanged profound salutations and compliments\r\nbefore they took their various places as host and guest. And then a\r\nbanquet was served. But all throughout Yüan-tê refrained from saying a\r\nword about Shu; he only chatted on general and common things.\r\n\r\nThe visitor noted this steady avoidance and resolved to probe his\r\nhost’s thoughts.\r\n\r\n“How many districts are there in Chingchou, where you are now, O\r\nImperial Uncle?”\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming replied, “Chingchou is only ours temporarily; we have\r\nborrowed it from Wu. They are always sending messengers to demand its\r\nreturn. However, now that our lord has married the daughter his\r\nposition is more secure. But it is still temporary.”\r\n\r\n“Wu is large,” said Chang Sung, “yet their six districts and their\r\neighty one departments do not satisfy them. The people are strong and\r\nthe land is fruitful.”\r\n\r\nSaid Pʻang Tʻung, “Our lord, being of the dynastic family, certainly\r\ncannot merely occupy two districts. Those others, thievish as they are,\r\nmay indeed seize upon as much territory as they are strong enough to\r\nhold, but such deeds are not according to the wise man’s heart.”\r\n\r\n“Noble Sirs, pray say no more: what virtue have I that I should expect\r\nanything from the future?” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“Not so, indeed,” said Chang Sung. “Illustrious Sir, you are of the\r\nlineage of Han; your noble character is widely known. No one could say\r\nthat your fate excludes all thought of occupying territory, where you\r\nmight begin to set up authority and take an Emperor’s position.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê deprecated such a suggestion, “Sir, you go too far; this really\r\nis too much.”\r\n\r\nThe next three days were spent in banquets and wine-parties, but all\r\nthe time no mention was made of the western province. And when, at the\r\nend of that time, Chang Sung took leave, his host was at the ten li\r\nrest-house to bid him farewell and offer refreshment. When the moment\r\ncame for the parting Liu Pei raised his wine-cup and said, “I am\r\nsincerely grateful that you deigned to come here. You have prolonged\r\nyour visit to three days, but now the moment of parting has come. Who\r\nknows when I may have the privilege of receiving your instructions\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\nAs he said this the tears flowed, but he hid them while Chang Sung,\r\nwilling to believe that this emotion was on his account, thought how\r\nwonderfully kind and noble his host must be to be thus affected. Quite\r\novercome, he decided to speak about Hsichʻuan. So he said, “I have\r\nthought that I, too, would come to you one day, but so far I have found\r\nno way. I see Sun Chʻüan on the east, always ready to pounce; I see\r\nTsʻao Tsʻao on the north, greedy to swallow. So this is not a wholly\r\ndesirable place for you to remain in.”\r\n\r\n“I know this but too well,” said Liu Pei, “but I have no secure place\r\nto go to.”\r\n\r\n“Ichou is well protected, has much fertile soil, is populous and well\r\ngoverned. Its scholars are attracted by your virtue. If you marched\r\nyour armies westward you could easily become a real power there and\r\nrestore the glory of the Hans.”\r\n\r\n“But how dare I attempt this? The ruler is also of the Imperial House.\r\nThe whole province is devoted to him for his good deeds, and no other\r\nman could attain such a hold.”\r\n\r\n“I am no traitor,” said Chang Sung, “but in your presence I feel\r\nconstrained to be perfectly open and plain. Liu, the prefect of Ichou,\r\nis naturally weak and can neither use the wise nor employ the capable.\r\nThen again Chang Lu threatens the north. People are distracted and\r\nwould gladly welcome an appreciative ruler. The journey I have just\r\nmade was to propose to support Tsʻao Tsʻao and place the province under\r\nhim, but I found him rebellious and set on evil, proud and arrogant. So\r\nI have turned aside to you. If you will take Hsichʻuan, you will have a\r\nbase from which to deal with Hanchung when you will, and the whole\r\ncountry beside. You will continue the rightful line and your name will\r\nlive in history. Would not that be real fame? If then you think of\r\ntaking our country I am willing to do what little I can as an ally\r\nwithin. But do you contemplate such a step?”\r\n\r\n“I am deeply grateful that you think so well of me. But the Prefect\r\nbeing a member of the family, I should lay myself open to general\r\nexecration were I to attack him.”\r\n\r\n“When a hero finds himself in the world, his duty is to work out his\r\ndestiny, to exert himself and perform his task as best as he can, to\r\npress forward among the foremost. At the moment the position is that,\r\nif you fail to seize this opportunity, some other will take possession\r\nand you will regret when too late.”\r\n\r\n“And I have heard much of the difficult nature of the country, its many\r\nhigh mountains and numerous streams, and its narrow roads. How could\r\nsuch a country be invaded?”\r\n\r\nThen Chang Sung drew the map from his sleeve. “I am so deeply affected\r\nby your virtue that I offer you this map of the country, whereby its\r\nroads and rivers may be known.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê unrolled the map; it was covered with notes, on the lie of the\r\nland, lengths and widths, and such matters. Strategical points on\r\nrivers and hills were shown, and store-houses and granaries and\r\ntreasuries. Everything was plainly stated.\r\n\r\nChang Sung went on, “Sir, you can prepare your plans promptly. I have\r\ntwo friends who will certainly help you. And when they come to see you,\r\nyou may be perfectly frank with them. Their names are Fa Chêng and Mêng\r\nTa.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê thanked him with joined hands. Said he, “As the blue mountains\r\ngrow not old and the green waters always remain, so shall I never\r\nforget. And when I shall have accomplished my task you shall have no\r\nmean reward.”\r\n\r\n“I look for no reward. Having met with an enlightened lord I felt\r\ncompelled to unbosom myself to him.”\r\n\r\nChang Sung left soon after and Kuan Yü escorted him for a long\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAfter arrival in Ichou, Chang Sung lost no time in sending for his\r\nfriends, Fa Chêng and Mêng Ta. The former was the first to come and he\r\nwas told of Tsʻao Tsʻao’s arrogance and haughtiness toward men of\r\nparts. “As for the man himself,” said he, “he is a man to grieve with\r\nbut not a man to rejoice with. I have promised Ichou to Liu Pei, the\r\nImperial Uncle, and I want your especial advice and assistance.”\r\n\r\n“I think Liu Chang incapable,” said Fa Chêng, “and I have felt drawn to\r\nLiu Pei for some time past. So we are in sympathy here.”\r\n\r\nShortly after Mêng Ta arrived. Mêng Ta and Fa Chêng were fellow\r\ntownsmen. When Mêng Ta entered the room and saw the other two in\r\nearnest and secret conversation, he said, “I know what you two are\r\nabout; you are scheming to hand over Ichou to somebody.”\r\n\r\n“It is really so; you have guessed right,” said Chang Sung. “But to\r\nwhom ought it to go?”\r\n\r\n“There is but one; Liu Pei,” said Mêng Ta.\r\n\r\nAll three clapped their hands and laughed.\r\n\r\nThen said Fa Chêng to Chang Sung, “You will see our lord to-morrow;\r\nwhat about that?”\r\n\r\n“I shall recommend that you two be sent to Chingchou on a mission.”\r\n\r\nThey thought that a suitable scheme. And when the lately arrived\r\nmessenger saw his master and was asked how he had fared, Chang Sung\r\nsaid, “Tsʻao Tsʻao is a rebel who desires to get the whole country into\r\nhis hands. I need hardly tell you that. But he also hankers after this\r\ndistrict.”\r\n\r\n“Then what will become of us?” said Liu Chang.\r\n\r\n“I have a plan to check both our enemies. Liu, the Imperial Uncle, now\r\nin Chingchou, is a relative of yours and he is generous and well\r\ndisposed. This is a matter of common knowledge. Tsʻao Tsʻao was simply\r\noverwhelmed at the result of the battle at Red Wall and Chang Lu more\r\nso. Now my plan is that you ally yourself with your distinguished\r\nrelative against Tsʻao Tsʻao and Chang Lu.”\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking thus for a long-time; can you recommend a\r\nsuitable emissary?”\r\n\r\n“The only ones are Fa Chêng and Mêng Ta.”\r\n\r\nThese two were summoned and, meanwhile, a letter was prepared. Fa Chêng\r\nwas to proceed as emissary to open up friendly relations and Mêng Ta\r\nwould follow in due course with an army to welcome Liu Pei into the\r\nwest country.\r\n\r\nWhile still discussing the details of the policy, a person forced his\r\nway in, his face all running with sweat, and cried out, “My lord; your\r\nland will be lost to you and pass to another if you listen to Chang\r\nSung.”\r\n\r\nChang Sung turned a startled look on the intruder, who was a certain\r\nHuang Chʻüan of Hsiliang, an accountant in the Prefect’s Palace.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect said, “Why do you use such language? Yüan-tê is of my\r\nfamily and so I am seeking his support.”\r\n\r\nSaid Huang Chʻüan, “I know all about him; he is liberal-minded to gain\r\npeople to his side and his softness can overcome the hardest. He is\r\nbolder than any other. He gains men’s hearts from afar off and those\r\nnear him look up to him. He also has the wisest advisers and the\r\nboldest warriors. But if you call him here as a soldier, think you that\r\nhe will be content to remain in a lowly condition? And if you treat him\r\nas an honoured guest, can a State stand two rulers? Hear me, my lord,\r\nand you stand secure as Mount Tʻai; be deaf to my words and your\r\nposition is as precarious as a pile of eggs. This Chang Sung has lately\r\ncome home through Chingchou where he has certainly been plotting with\r\nLiu Pei. Slay this man; and make an end of Liu Pei. That will be for\r\nthe happiness of this land.”\r\n\r\n“But how else am I to fend off my two enemies?”\r\n\r\n“Fortify your country; dig out your moats and raise your ramparts. Then\r\nyou can wait on events.”\r\n\r\n“If these rebels invade this land the position will be critical, as\r\nwhen fire singes one’s eyebrows. It is idle talk to tell me to wait on\r\nevents.”\r\n\r\nNo notice was taken of Huang Chʻüan, and Fa Chêng was about to set out\r\nwhen another interfered, crying, “No, No.” This was a secretary, Wang\r\nLei.\r\n\r\nWith bowed head Wang Lei stood and said, “My lord will bring misfortune\r\nupon himself if he listens to this Chang Sung.”\r\n\r\n“Not so; I make an alliance with Liu Yüan-tê in order to withstand\r\nChang Lu.”\r\n\r\n“A Chang Lu invasion would be but a skin disease. Liu Pei’s entry into\r\nthis country would be a mortal malady. Liu Pei is an unscrupulous\r\nbravo; he was once in Tsʻao Tsʻao’s service and plotted against him.\r\nThen he hung on to Sun Chʻüan and seized Chingchou. This shows his\r\ncharacter and his designs. Think you that you two can dwell together?\r\nIf you invite him, then Hsichʻuan is lost.”\r\n\r\n“No more wild talk!” cried Liu Chang angrily. “Yüan-tê is of my clan\r\nand family and will not ravish me of my possessions.”\r\n\r\nHe bade the lictors escort both men outside and ordered Fa Chêng to set\r\nout. So he did; and before long came to Chingchou. When the salutations\r\nwere over he presented his letter, which Yüan-tê opened and read.\r\n\r\n“I, Liu Chang, a younger brother of our family, now write to General\r\nLiu Yüan-tê. From my humble place long have I gazed in your direction,\r\nbut the roads of Shu are precipitous and I have failed to send my\r\ntribute. This is to my shame. The victims of misfortune aid each other\r\nand those in trouble support each other. If friends act thus, how much\r\nmore should members of the same family? Now Chang Lu is mustering an\r\narmy of invasion on my northern frontier, much to the injury of my\r\ntranquillity. Wherefore I send this letter that you may know of my\r\ndistress and if you remember the kindly bonds of family and will play a\r\nbrotherly part and lead your armies to destroy these ruffians, you will\r\nbe my eternal protector and I shall be ever grateful. This letter\r\nleaves much unsaid, but I await your coming.”\r\n\r\nThis letter greatly pleased Yüan-tê. He made a banquet for the bearer\r\nthereof, and when they had mellowed themselves with wine, he dismissed\r\nthe attendants and spoke to Fa Chêng in confidence.\r\n\r\n“Friend, I have long admired you, and Chang Sung extolled your virtues.\r\nI shall always feel grateful for this opportunity of hearing you.”\r\n\r\nFa Chêng bowed. “That is too great praise for a humble emissary from\r\nShu. But they say that horses always neighed in recognition of Po Lo,\r\nthe supreme judge of horses, and when a man has found his lord he dies\r\nfor him. Have you thought further of Chang Sung’s proposals, General?”\r\n\r\n“I have always been a wanderer, often in suffering and sorrow. I have\r\noften thought of the wren for even that tiny bird has a twig to rest\r\non; and of the cunning hare, that secures safety with three openings to\r\nits burrow. Does not a man need at least a shelter? Your land of Shu is\r\nfertile and a temptation, but its ruler is of my family and I cannot\r\nplot against him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Ichou is a very paradise. But without a ruler it cannot exist.\r\nLiu Chang knows not how to use the wise man and his heritage must\r\nspeedily pass to another. To-day it is offered to your hands and you\r\nmust not miss the opportunity. You know the saying, that the leader in\r\nthe hunt gets the quarry. If you will only consent, I will serve you to\r\nthe death.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê signified his gratitude. Said he, “Let me reflect for a time\r\nand take advice.”\r\n\r\nThe banquet terminated and the guest left. Kʻung-ming conducted Fa\r\nChêng to his lodging while his master sat thinking. Then Pʻang Tʻung\r\nsaid, “You must decide; not to decide is foolish. You are of high\r\nintelligence, my lord, and why do you hesitate?”\r\n\r\n“What should my reply be?” asked Yüan-tê.\r\n\r\n“You know these surroundings and with them you cannot attain your ends.\r\nNow before you lies a populous, fertile and rich land, a base with the\r\ngreatest possibilities. You have the promise of assistance from two men\r\nwithin and it seems like a gift of providence. Why hesitate?”\r\n\r\n“Now there are two men in the world as mutually antagonistic as fire\r\nand water. My opposite is Tsʻao Tsʻao. He is impetuous and I am long\r\nsuffering; he is cruel and I am humane; he feigns, while I am true. In\r\nall particulars I act the direct contrary to him. I refuse to risk the\r\nloss of the confidence and trust of the world for a trifling\r\nadvantage.”\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung smiled at these sentiments. “My lord’s words are quite in\r\naccord with abstract rectitude, but such ideas scarcely suit the days\r\nof rebellion. There are other ways of fighting than with warlike\r\nweapons, but to adhere too obstinately to the idea of abstract\r\nrectitude is to do nothing. One must be an opportunist, annex the weak\r\nand attack the wilfully deluded: seize the recalcitrant and protect the\r\ndocile. These were the teachings of Tʻang and Wu. If after the\r\nsettlement you reward with righteousness and make of the land a great\r\ncountry, will you be guilty of a breach of trust? Remember if you do\r\nnot take it now another will.”\r\n\r\nYüan-tê, a prey to confused emotions, replied, “These words are as\r\njewels; they should be engraven on my very heart.”\r\n\r\nThereupon he summoned Kʻung-ming to settle the details of an army to\r\nmarch west.\r\n\r\nKʻung-ming said, “This is an important place and must be well\r\ndefended.”\r\n\r\nLiu Pei replied, “I, Pʻang Tʻung and my two captains Huang Chung and\r\nWei Yen will go into Hsichʻuan; you and our three best captains, my two\r\nbrothers and Chao Tzŭ-lung, can defend Chingchou.”\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was told off for Hsiangyang and the narrow pass of Chʻingni,\r\nChang Fei went along the river and Chao Yün camped at Chiangling. For\r\nthe march westward, Huang Chung led the van, Wei Yen had the rearguard,\r\nwhile Yüan-tê moved in the centre. Pʻang Tʻung was commander of the\r\nwhole army.\r\n\r\nJust as the five legions were starting there came Liao Hua to\r\nsurrender; he and his men were attached to Kuan Yü.\r\n\r\nIt was in the winter that the expedition started. Soon they met the\r\nforce under Mêng Ta, five companies, to act as escort into Ichou. Liu\r\nPei informed Liu Chang that he had started and the latter sent orders\r\nto the districts along the road to entertain them well on the march.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect proposed to go out in person to welcome Liu Pei and ordered\r\ncarriages to be prepared and tents and banners. All the escort were\r\ndressed in glittering armour. At this the accountant, Huang Chʻüan, the\r\nsturdy opponent of the invitation to Liu Pei, again remonstrated.\r\n\r\n“My lord, if you go out you will be exposed to danger. I have been in\r\nyour service for many years and I would prevent you from being the\r\nvictim of another’s wiles. I pray you reflect.”\r\n\r\nChang Sung said, “His words are those of one who would sow discord in a\r\nfamily and encourage the power of the robbers who threaten you.\r\nAssuredly such action is to your detriment.”\r\n\r\nLiu Chang then spoke angrily to Huang Chʻüan saying, “I have decided,\r\nand why do you oppose me?”\r\n\r\nThe objector bowed his head and wept. Then approaching nearer he seized\r\nhold of the Prefect’s robe with his teeth to hinder him. Liu Chang\r\nangrily shook his robe and rose from his seat, but Huang Chʻüan still\r\nheld on till two of his teeth fell out. Then the lictors forced him\r\naway and he retired, still crying.\r\n\r\nAs Liu Chang was starting another man cried, “My lord, do you neglect\r\nthe loyal words of your faithful Huang Chʻüan to go to your death?”\r\n\r\nAnd he threw himself prostrate at the steps in remonstrance. He was\r\none, Li Kʻuei, of Chienning.\r\n\r\n“The prince may have Ministers who remonstrate with him and the father\r\nmay have sons who oppose,” said he. “Huang Chʻüan has spoken faithfully\r\nand you ought to listen. To let Liu Pei into this land is to welcome\r\nthe tiger into your gates.”\r\n\r\n“Yüan-tê is my brother and will not harm me,” said the Prefect. “And\r\nany other who shall oppose me shall suffer death.”\r\n\r\nSo Li Kʻuei was thrust out.\r\n\r\n“The officers of Shu regard the safety of their families and no longer\r\nrender you service. The captains are arrogant and each has some scheme\r\nof his own to further. If you do not get Liu Pei to oppose the enemy\r\nwithout and your own people oppose you within, surely you are on the\r\nroad to ruin.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Chang Sung and the Prefect replied that he knew the plan was\r\nfor his advantage. Whereupon he mounted his horse to ride out to Elm\r\nTree Bridge.\r\n\r\nThen it was reported to him that Wang Lei had suspended himself, head\r\ndownwards, at the city gate. In one hand he held a written remonstrance\r\nand in the other a knife. “And he says that if you heed him not he will\r\ncut the rope and die at your feet,” concluded the messenger.\r\n\r\nLiu Chang went to the gate, took the writing and read:—“Good medicine\r\nis bitter in the mouth but good for the disease; faithful words offend\r\nthe ear but are good for the conduct. Of old the king of Chʻu listened\r\nnot to Chʻu Yüan, but attended the meeting at Wukuan and was captured.\r\nSir, you are thoughtlessly leaving your place to go to welcome Liu Pei,\r\nbut I fear there is a way out and none in. Could you but behead Chang\r\nSung in the market-place and have nothing to do with this league with\r\nLiu Pei, it would be for the happiness of old and young, and assure the\r\nsafety of yourself.”\r\n\r\nAnger rose in his breast as he read.\r\n\r\n“Why do you insult me when I go to meet a kindly man? I feel as if I\r\nwere about to enjoy the delight of seeing a brother?”\r\n\r\nAt this Wang Lei gave a great cry, severed the rope and fell to the\r\nground battered and dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Head downwards at the city gate one hung,\r\n        A last remonstrance in his outstretched hand,\r\n        Resolved that, were his words rejected, he\r\n        Would not survive defeat. Sincere was he\r\n        Who, desperate, held to Liu Chang’s silken robe\r\n        Until his broken teeth released their grip.\r\n        Sincere indeed, but how can he compare\r\n        With stern Wang Lei, who went to awful death?\r\n\r\n\r\nLiu Chang with a great company went out to welcome his clansman and\r\nthere followed many waggons laden with supplies and rich stuffs.\r\n\r\nLiu Pei’s advanced guard had arrived at Shuchü. During the march the\r\npeople had brought presents, and Liu Pei had given an order to pay for\r\neverything, under penalty of death for disobedience. Thus no one\r\nsuffered and the people came out in trusting crowds to watch the\r\nsoldiers marching by and welcome them in every way. Liu Pei soothed\r\nthem with very gracious words.\r\n\r\nThen Fa Chêng secretly showed Pʻang Tʻung a letter from Chang Sung\r\nadvocating the assassination of Liu Chang near the place of welcome.\r\n\r\nPʻang Tʻung said, “Say nothing about this; after the two Lius have met\r\nthere may be opportunities but this is too early to talk. Any plot\r\nwould leak out.”\r\n\r\nSo nothing was said. Fouchʻêng, where the meeting was to take place, is\r\nthree hundred and sixty li from Chʻêngtu. Liu Chang arrived first and\r\nsent messengers to welcome Liu Pei. The two armies camped on the bank\r\nof the Fou River. Liu Pei went into the city to see the Prefect and\r\nthey met cordially as brothers should. Both shed a few tears, and by\r\nand bye they began a heart-to-heart talk. Then followed a banquet and\r\nafter this each returned to his own camp.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect said, “How ridiculous have been proved the fears of Huang\r\nChʻüan and Wang Lei! They do not understand the force of family\r\naffection. I see he is really a kindly and noble man, and with him as a\r\nsupport I shall fear neither Tsʻao nor Chang. And I owe all this to\r\nChang Sung.”\r\n\r\nTo show his gratitude he took off the green silken robe he wore and\r\nsent it as a gift to Chang Sung, together with five hundred liang of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of his officers were not so content and a group of them\r\nbade him beware.\r\n\r\n“Do not rejoice too soon, O Master,” said they, “for Liu Pei is hard\r\nenough within in spite of his mild exterior. You have not sounded him\r\nyet and should be on your guard.”\r\n\r\n“You are all too anxious;” said he, laughing, “my brother is no\r\ndouble-dealer, I am sure.”\r\n\r\nWhen Liu Pei had returned to his own tent, Pʻang Tʻung came in to ask\r\nwhat impression he had of his host of that day.\r\n\r\n“He seems a very honest man,” said Liu Pei.\r\n\r\n“He is good enough, but some of his servants are discontented at this\r\nturn of affairs and I would not guarantee there will be no murders. If\r\nyou took my advice you would have Liu Chang assassinated at the return\r\nbanquet. A hundred ruffians behind the arras, a signal from you, and\r\nthe deed would be accomplished. All that would be needed then would be\r\na rush on the capital. No sword need be drawn, no arrow fitted to the\r\nstring.”\r\n\r\n“He is a brother of my house and has treated me with sincerity. I am a\r\nnew-comer and so far unknown in this land. Such a deed would be\r\nabhorrent to all the world and these people would resent it. I will not\r\nestablish myself by such means.”\r\n\r\n“The scheme is not mine; it originated in a private letter from Chang\r\nSung, who says it will have to be done some time.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Fa Chêng came in and said, “This is not for ourselves;\r\nit is the will of heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Liu Chang and I are of the same house and I would shudder at harming\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you are wrong. If you act not as we propose, then Chang Lu will\r\ntake Shu in revenge for the death of his mother. What is there for you\r\nat the end of your long march? Advance, and success is yours; retreat\r\nand you have nothing. And delays are most dangerous. At any moment this\r\nscheme may leak out and another will reap the profit. This is the day\r\nwhen Heaven smiles on you. Act before Liu Chang suspects you; establish\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nSo urged Fa Chêng and Pʻang Tʻung backed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Their lord, by argument, they tried\r\n        From rectitude to turn aside.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Liu Pei hid in his heart will be explained in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          END OF VOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 1750 B.C.\r\n\r\n[2] 80 B.C.\r\n\r\n[3] The grass in the meadow is an ingenious quip on Tung Cho’s surname;\r\nas is the “ten days” on his distinguishing name.\r\n\r\n[4] Modern Anhui.\r\n\r\n[5] The Great Bear and Vega.\r\n\r\n[6] The Milky Way.\r\n\r\n[7] A star in Taurus.\r\n\r\n[8] Groups of stars similar to the Great Bear Constellation.\r\n\r\n[9] Points of the compass, including the centre.\r\n\r\n[10] The country about modern Kiangsu and south Shantung.\r\n\r\n[11] An editor here remarks in a note, “With a hundred ounces of silver\r\nLiu An could get himself another wife, but I am afraid no one would\r\nmarry him.
